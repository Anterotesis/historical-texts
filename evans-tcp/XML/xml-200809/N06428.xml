<P><HI>The Governor opened the Conferences with the following Ceremonies, addressing himself to all the</HI> Indians <HI>present, of every Nation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>IT gives me great Pleasure to see so many of you, and of so many different Nations, at this Council Fire. I bid you heartily Welcome.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this String I wipe the Sweat and Dust out of your Eyes, that you may see your Bre∣threns Faces, and look chearful. With this String I take all Bitterness out of your Breast, as well as every Thing disagreeable that may have gathered there, in order that you may speak perfectly free and open to us. With this String I gather the Blood, and take it away from the Council Seats, that your Clothes may not be stained, nor your Minds any Ways disturbed.</P>
<P><HI>Three Strings.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> interpreted the Substance of this Speech, and saying his Memory did not serve him to remember the several Ceremonies in Use on this Occasion, he desired <HI>Nichas,</HI> a <HI>Mo∣hawk</HI> Chief, to do it for him, which he did, and it was afterwards interpreted by Captain <HI>Henry Montour,</HI> in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and the <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>
<P>After a short Pause, <HI>Tagashata,</HI> the <HI>Seneca</HI> Chief, rose up, and repeating, as usual, each Paragraph distincty as spoke by the Governor, he returned Thanks, and went through the same Ceremonies to the Governor, Council, and People of the Province, adding on the last String, that their Great Grandfathers had told them, that they had made a Road for them to travel to their Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> and that whenever it should be stopped, they would be∣come a poor People. They were very glad to find the Road open to their Brethren, and should take Care to preserve it so on their Side.</P>
<P><HI>Three Strings.</HI></P>
<P>After Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> had delivered this in <HI>English,</HI> and it was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language by <HI>Moses Tittamy, Takeaghsado,</HI> or <HI>Tagashata,</HI> Proceeded;</P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI></P>

<HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Belt you sent an Invitation to us to come to <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> which reached our Towns about the Time that the Leaves put out last Spring, but we were then so much alarmed by the <HI>French,</HI> who were near us, that we could not then leave our Country. Some little Time ago we received another Belt from Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> which he informed us was sent to him by you, to be forwarded to us, to enquire into the Reasons why we did not come to you, according to your first Invitation, and Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> desired us to come here to meet you in Council; upon which we immediately arose, and came as soon as we could to your Council Fire, and now we are here, as you see.</P>
<P><HI>Two Belts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>Here is another Belt, by which we were invited lately to come to a Council Fire, that was kindled in an Island near the Sea: This surprized us, as we never heard of a Council Fire in an Island.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meaning <HI>Burlington.</HI></NOTE> We know of no Council Fires, but the old Council Fire at <HI>Philadel∣phia,</HI> and the great Council Fire in <HI>Albany.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Here be laid the Belt on the Table.</HI></P>
<P>Then taking four other Strings of Wampum, he said, These were sent to us by <HI>Nichas,</HI> the <HI>Mchawk</HI> Chief, with a Message, that he was arrived in this Province, and desired we would comply with the Invitation, and come down.</P>
<P><HI>Here be laid the four Strings on the Table</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nichas</HI> having acknowledged the Message, and taken up the Strings, <HI>Tagashata</HI> concluded, saying, These are your Belts, by which we were invited to this Council Fire; and as we are now come, we return them, and desire to see the Belts that were sent by us, particu∣larly one, on which were several Images of Men holding each other by the Hand.</P>
<P>The Governor replied, that he would enquire for the Belts sent by them, and they should be returned.</P>
<P>The Substance of these last Speeches of <HI>Tagashata</HI> was interpreted to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and the <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>

<P><HI>TAGASHATA,</HI> the <HI>Seneca</HI> Chief, intending to speak first, on Behalf of the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> had laid some Belts and Strings in Order on the Table.</P>
<P>As soon as the Company sat down, <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> holding out a String, said he had something to deliver, and desired he might be heard first of all. Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> requested <PB N="6" REF="008156_0006_102E3E542A0F6908"/>to know, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what he was going to say was the result of the <HI>Delaware</HI> Council, and if it was their Desire it should be spoke first; but no Answer was given him as to this.</P>
<P>Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> signifying his Desire to bid the <HI>Indians</HI> welcome, and ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mention to them the Business he came upon, it was agreed he should speak first, which he did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am glad to see so many of you met together, to cultivate Peace with your Brethren and old Friends the <HI>English.</HI> I heartily bid you welcome; and wish that the good Work for which you are now assembled, may prosper in your Hands, and have that Success, which your wise Men, and all that wish you well, must desire, as a Thing much to your Advantage.</P>
<P>The Situation of the Province over which I preside, and the Disposition of its People, have hitherto afforded very little Occasion for Treaties with the neighbouring <HI>Indians</HI>; but having, some Months ago, sent a Message to the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> I received a Message from our Brethren the <HI>Senecas,</HI> and <HI>Cayugas,</HI> wherein they take upon them to answer my Message to the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and desire that I would meet them at the Council Fire burning at this Place.</P>
<P>It is not usual for the King's Governors to go out of their Provinces to attend Treaties; but I am glad to have an Opportunity of shewing my good Disposition to establish Peace and Friendship with my Neighbours; and therefore I have waved all Forms, and am come here, according to the Invitation I received at <HI>Burlington.</HI></P>
<P>To you therefore, our Brethren the <HI>Senecas</HI> and <HI>Cayugas,</HI> and your Nephews the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> I now speak, and desire that you would take into your most serions Consideration, my Mes;∣sage to the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> your Message to me, and my Answer thereto, and let me know what we are to expect from you.</P>
<P>What is past, we are willing to forget; but I must remind you, that if you are disposed to be our Friends for the future, you should give us that Proof of your Sincerity which I have desired in my Answer to your Message, and return us the Captives that have been tak∣en out of our Province, and are now within your Power; this should be one of the first Steps, and will be the best that can be taken, towards restoring and confirming that Brotherly Love and Friendship between us, which I am convinced will be for the mutual Benefit of all Parties.</P>
<P>This was interpreted in the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Language by Mr. <HI>Weiser,</HI> and in the <HI>Delaware</HI> by Mr. <HI>Stephen Calvin,</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> Schoolmaster in <HI>West-Jersey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then</HI> Teedyuscung <HI>spoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I desire all of you who are present, will give Ear to me. As you, my Brethren, de∣sired me to call all the Nations who live back, I have done so; I have given the Halloo, and such as have heard me are present. Now, if you have any Thing to say to them, or they to you, you must sit and talk together.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I sit by, only to hear and see what you say to one another; for I have said what I have to say to the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> who sits here; he knows what has passed between us. I have made known to him the Reason why I struck him. Now I and the Governor have made up these Differences between him and me, and I think we have done it, as far as we can, for our future Peace.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>The above Speech was interpreted in the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Language.</P>
<P>Tagashata <HI>then rose up and spoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren the Governors, and your Councils,</HI></P>
<P>It has pleased the most High that we meet together here with chearful Countenances, and a good deal of Satisfaction; and as publick Business requires grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Consideration, and the Day is almost spent, I chuse to speak early To-morrow Morning.</P>
<P>The Governors answered, that they should be glad to give all the Dispatch possible to this good Work they were engaged in; and desired the Chiefs would fix the Time of Meeting; but they declined it, saying, they were unacquainted with Hours, but would give Notice when they were ready.</P>

<P><HI>TAGASHATA,</HI> the <HI>Seneca</HI> Chief, taking the Strings and Belt of Wampum which Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> gave Yesterday, repeated, according to the <HI>Indian</HI> Custom, the Particulars of his Speech, and then added,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We approve of every Article mentioned to us Yesterday by the Governor of <HI>Jersey,</HI> all that be said is very good; we look upon his Message to us as a Commission and Request from him, that we should bring Matters to a good Conclusion with our Cousins the <HI>Minisinks.</HI> They themselves sent for us to do the same Thing, on their Behalf, and, at their Request, we came here, have taken it in Hand, and will use our utmost Endeavours to bring about the good Work which Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> desires, and do not doubt but it will be done to his en∣tire Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I now speak at the Request of <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and our Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> living at <HI>Wyomink,</HI> and on the Waters of the River <HI>Sasquehannah.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We now remove the Hatchet out of your Heads that was struck into them by our Confine the <HI>Delawares,</HI> it was a <HI>French</HI> Hatchet that they unfortunately made use of, by the Instiga∣tion of the <HI>French</HI> we take it out of your Heads, and bury it under Ground, where it shall always, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and never be taken up again. Our Cousins the <HI>Delawares</HI> have assured us they will never think of War against their Brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> any more, but employ their Thought about Peace, and cultivating Friendship with them, and never suffer Enmity against them to enter into their Minds again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Delawares</HI> desired us to say this for them by this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Our Nephews, the <HI>Minisink Indians,</HI> and three other different Tribe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of that Nation, have, at last, listened to us, and taken our Advice, and laid down the Hatchet they had taken up against their Brethren the <HI>English.</HI> They told us they had received it from the <HI>French,</HI> but had already laid it down, and would return it to them again.</P>
<P>They assured us, they would never use it any more against you, but would follow our Advice, and entreated us to use our utmost Endeavours to reconcile them to you their Bre∣thren, declaring they were sorry for what they had done, and desired it might be forgotten, and they would for ever cultivate a good Friendship with you. These Declarations were made by the principal Warriors of Four Tribes of the <HI>Minisink Indians</HI> at giving us this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Then, taking eight Strings of Black Wampum, he proceeded.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We let you know that we have not only brought about this Union with our Nephews on the Waters of the River <HI>Sasquebannab,</HI> but also have sent Messages to our Nephews the <HI>Dela∣wares</HI> and <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and to those likewise of our own Nations, who are on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> under the Influence of the <HI>French.</HI> We have told all these that they must lay down the <HI>French</HI> Hatchet, and be reconciled to their Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> and never more employ it against them, and we hope they will take our Advice. We the <HI>Mohawks, Senecas,</HI> and <HI>Onondagas,</HI> deliver this String of Wampum to remove the Hatchet out of your Heads, that has been struck into them by the <HI>Ohio Indians,</HI> in order to lay a Foundation for Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Eight Strings of Black Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tagashata</HI> sat down, and then the <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, <HI>Tokanio,</HI> arose and said,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I speak in Behalf of the younger Nations, Part of, and confederated with, the <HI>Six Na∣tions, viz.</HI> The <HI>Cayugas, Oneidoes, Tuscaroras, Tuteloes, Nanticokes,</HI> and <HI>Coneys.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="008156_0008_102E3E573760DD58"/>
A Road has been made from our Country to this Council Fire, that we might treat about Friendship; and as we came down the Road, we saw that (by some Misfortune or other) Blood has lately been spilt on it. By these Strings we make the Road wider and clearer;— we take the Blood away out of it, and likewise out of the Council Chamber, which may have been stained; we wash it all away, and desire it may not be seen any more, and we take the Hatchet out of your Heads.</P>
<P><HI>Gave three Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the Governors, and all the</HI> English,</P>
<P>I now confine myself to the <HI>Cayugas,</HI> my own Nation.</P>
<P>I will hide nothing from you, because we have promised to speak to each other from the Bottom of our Hearts.</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> like a Thief in the Night, have stolen away some of our young Men, and misled them, and they have been concerned in doing Mischief against our Brethren the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>We did not know it when it happened, but we discovered it since. The Chiefs of our Nation held their young Men fast, and would not suffer them to go out of their Sight, but the <HI>French</HI> came and stole them away from us, and corrupted them to do Mischief. We are sorry for it; we ask Pardon for them, and hope you will forgive them; we promise they shall do so no more, and now, by this Belt, we take out of your Heads the Hatchet with which they struck you.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt of ten Rows.</HI></P>

<P>AS soon as the <HI>Indians</HI> had taken their Seats, Governor <HI>Denny</HI> made the following Speech.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, Chiefs and Warriors of the</HI> United Nations, <HI>and others your Brethren and Nephews, now met here,</HI> Agreeable to your Request, at our first Meeting, I now return you the Belt, which the young <HI>Seneca Indian</HI> brought me, with your Answer to the Invitation I gave you to come down to this Council Fire.</P>
<P><HI>Here his Honour returned the Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I invited you to come down to the Council Fire kindled at this Place by me and your Nephew <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> with a Design to lay before you Matters of the greatest Consequence to you and us; I am now about to communicate them to you, and to answer all that has been said by you to me, since our meeting together; I therefore, by this String, open your Ears, that you may hear clearly, and carefully attend to what I shall say to you.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I must first put you in Mind, that perfect Peace and Friendship subsisted between you and your Brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> in this Province, from our first Settlement among you, and that whatever little Disputes happened between your People and ours, they were amicably settled and adjusted by our wise Men at our Council Fires, according to an Agreement made by our first Proprietary WILLIAM PENN, and your Fathers. Had this wise Agreement been care∣fully observed, as it always ought to have been, our late unhappy Differences had never arose. But what is passed cannot be recalled, and shall be forgotten. Let us both resolve never to be guilty of the like Error for the future.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You gave us Yesterday these two Belts, in Behalf of your Nephews the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and joined with them in taking out of our Heads the Hatchets with which we had been struck, acquainting us, <Q>that these Hatchets were given to your Nephews by the <PB N="9" REF="008156_0009_102E3E59BAA7B388"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> they would not use them any more against us; but were heartily disposed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Friendship with us for the future.</Q></P>

<P>By <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Strings of black Wampum, you the <HI>Mohawks, Senecas,</HI> and <HI>Onondagoes,</HI> told us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not only brought about an Union with the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Minisinks,</HI> on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the River <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> but had also sent Messages to the <HI>Indians</HI> now on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> those of these two Nations, as those of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> under the <HI>French</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> desiring them to lay down the Hatchet, and enter again into Friendship with their B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>n the <HI>English</HI>; and, on their Behalf, you have taken the Hatchets out of our Heads, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to lay a Foundation for a future Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the</HI> Mohawks, Senecas, <HI>and</HI> Onondagoes,</P>

<P>We accept your Strings, and approve your taking the Hatchet, on the Behalf of the <HI>Ohio Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>,</HI> out of our Heads, so far as to make it the Foundation of a future Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Nine Strings</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the</HI> Cayugas, Oneidoes, Tuscaroras, Tuteloes, Nanticokes, <HI>or</HI> Conoys, <HI>the younger Nations, who are Parts of, and united with, the</HI> Six Nations,</P>
<P>By these Strings you say, <Q>That, as you came down the Road which has been opened <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your Country to this Council Fire, you saw Blood lately spilt upon it, and have washed it away, not only out of the Road, but out of the Council Chamber, lest that should have been stained.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We join, by these Strings, with you, in removing the Blood. We bury it deep in the Earth.</P>
<P><HI>Three Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brothers the</HI> Cayugas,</P>
<P>With this Belt <Q>you justly lament the Folly of your young Men, who have suffered themselves to be stolen away from you by the <HI>French,</HI> and then, at their Instigation, to strike us. You take the Hatchet out of our Heads, you ask Pardon for them, and desire we will forgive the Mischief they have done us, and both you and they promise never to hurt us more.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We accept the Belt in their Behalf, and give you this Belt in Token of our Friendship and Reconciliation.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember, that the Day before Yesterday, your Nephew <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> told me by this String, <Q>that he had already said to me, at our former Meetings, every Thing he had to say, and had made me acquainted with the Cause why he had struck us, and that I knew what had passed between us.—That we had made up all Differences, and had done it, as far as we could, for our future Peace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That at my Request he had given the Halloo, and brought down to this Place you who heard him, and are now present; and that he would sit by, and hear what we said to∣gether.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As there are a great many of you here, who were not present at our former Meetings, I think it proper, for your Information, to give you a short Account of what has passed be∣tween your Nephews the <HI>Delawares</HI> and us.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="008156_0010_102E3E5C4CCD30F0"/>About three Years ago your Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> living on the Borders of this Province, were struck on a sudden, at a Time when they were in profound Peace with you, and fol∣lowing their Business, suspecting no Danger. Many were killed, and others carried away Captives.</P>
<P>We were surprized, and did not know who struck us, but sent Messengers up the <HI>Sas∣quehannah,</HI> as far as the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Country, to enquire whence the Blow came, and for what Reason</P>
<P>On the Return of these Messengers, we were informed that the Hatchet had been struck into our Heads by our Countrymen the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawanese.</HI></P>
<P>Some Time after this Discovery was made, a Cessation of Hostilities was brought about by the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> at our Request, made to them for that Purpose by Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI>; and, upon our Invitation, our Brother <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> came down, with a Number of <HI>Dela∣wares</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> to a Council Fire, kindled at this Place, where we have since had several Meetings.</P>
<P>At one of these Meetings <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> told us, that the Cause of the War was, their foolish young Men had been persuaded by the false-hearted <HI>French</HI> King to strike their Bre∣thren the <HI>English</HI>; and one Reason why the Blow came harder was, that the Proprietaries of this Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> had taken from them by Fraud the Ground we now stand on, and all the Lands lying between <HI>Tohiccon-Creek</HI> and <HI>Wyomink,</HI> on the River <HI>Sasquehannah.</HI></P>
<P>At last all Blood was wiped away, and buried under Ground, and Peace Belts were ex∣changed between us and our Brother <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> who then told us he acted in Behalf of Ten Nations, and promised to bring in and restore to us all our Fellow-Subjects that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been carried off Prisoners by them.</P>
<P>For the Truth of this short Relation I refer you to our Brother <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> who will confirm it to you more particularly.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>To continue our Friendship, it is absolutely necessary to preserve Faith, and keep the Pro∣mises we make with each other.</P>
<P>I will speak plainly to you, and from the Bottom of my Heart, as one Friend ought to another, that nothing may lie heavy on my Mind to disturb me hereafter; and I expect the same Openness and Freedom on your Parts.</P>
<P>I desire therefore to know the true Reason, why our Flesh and Blood, who are in Capti∣vity, and in your Power, have not been delivered to us, according to the Promise made us by our Brother <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> in Behalf of all the <HI>Indians</HI> he represented; and what is be∣come of those Belts we gave him to confirm the Peace, and that Promise; for till that Pro∣mise is complied with, we can never sleep in Quiet, or rest satisfied in the Friendship of those who detain our Children and Relations from us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>After the Governor had done speaking, the <HI>United Nations</HI> gave the usual Shouts of Ap∣probation, with great Solemnity, each according to Rank.</P>
<P>Then Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> delivered the Belts requested by the <HI>Senecas, Cayugas,</HI> and <HI>Mini∣sinks,</HI> and spoke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> has given a particular Answer to what has been said to us both. So far as his Answer relates to the Province over which I preside, I confirm what has been said by this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Previous to what follows, it is necessary to observe, that <HI>Pisquitomen,</HI> and another <HI>Ohio In∣dian,</HI> having come to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> last Summer, acquainted the Governor, that the <HI>Indians</HI> in those Parts had not received any Account of the late Transactions with this Government, not any Message from it; and that they might be persuaded to lay down the Hatchet, the Go∣vernor therefore took that Opportunity to send a friendly Message to those <HI>Indians</HI> by <HI>Pis∣quitomen,</HI> and appointed Mr. <HI>Frederick Post,</HI> a <HI>German,</HI> who understood the <HI>Delaware</HI> Lan∣guage, to attend him, and acquaint the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Ohio</HI> of the Peace made by the <HI>Sasque∣hannah</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="008156_0011_102E3E5FED2649E0"/>
<HI>Delawares▪</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> and the Disposition of this Government to forgive what was past, if they would return to their antient Alliance. This Message was accordingly delivered, and an Answer returned by <HI>Frederick Post, Pisquitomen,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hickman,</HI> an <HI>Ohio Indian,</HI> who having come down together as far as <HI>Harris's</HI> Ferry, <HI>Frederick Post</HI> went to wait on General <HI>Forbes,</HI> and left the two <HI>Indians</HI> to proceed with the Message, who being now arrived at <HI>Easton, Pisquitomen,</HI> who had the particular Charge of it, introduced it as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>When I was at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> the chief Men sat together as we do here now. I was em∣ployed by the Governor, <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and <HI>Israel Pemberton,</HI> these three Men, pointing to them and the chief Men told me, that when I should come among the <HI>English</HI> Inhabitants, I must shake Hands for them with the Governor, <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and <HI>Israel Pemberton</HI> (here he shook Hands with them) and that what they had to say, was written down in a Paper, which he then produced, and said they desired it might be read in Publick. Now you, Gen∣tlemen, who are Head Men, sent <HI>Frederick Post</HI> with me, desiring me to take and carry him in my Bosom there, and when I came there, to introduce him to the publick Council; I did this, and have brought him back safe again.</P>
<P>Then taking a Belt, and three Strings of Wampum, which were delivered with the Paper, he said he would interpret them; but as all that was said was truly set down in the Writing, it was not necessary. Let it be read.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Pisquitomen</HI> delivered the Paper, with the Belt and three Strings of Wampum, who, on being asked alterwards to whom they were sent, answered, one was sent to the Governor, another to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and another to <HI>Israel Pemberton.</HI> The Message was read in these Words.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> Indians <HI>speak now. Brethren, hear what I have to say.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>IT is a good many Days since we have seen and heard of you from all Sorts of Nations.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>This is the first Message which we have seen and heard of you; we have not yet rightly heard you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have talked of that Peace and Friendship which we had formerly with you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We tell you to be strong, and always remember that Friendship which we had formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We desire you would be strong, and let us once more hear of our good Friendship and Peace we had formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We desire you to make Haste, and let us soon hear of you again.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Hear what I have to say; look Brethren, since we have seen and heard of you of all Sorts of Nations, we see that you are sorry that we have not that Friendship we formerly had.</P>
<P>Look Brethren, we at <HI>Allegheny</HI> are likewise sorry that we have not that Friendship with you we formerly had.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We long for that Peace and Friendship we had formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It is good that you have held that Friendship which we had formerly amongst our Fathers and Grandfathers.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We must tell you we will not let that Friendship quite drop, which was formerly be∣tween us. Now, Brethren, it is three Years since we dropped that Peace and Friendship which we formerly had with you. Now, Brethren, that Friendship is dropped, and lies buried in the Ground where you and I stand, in the Middle between us both. Now, Bre∣thren, since I see you have digged up and revived that Friendship, which was buried in the Ground, now you have it, hold it fast. Do, be strong, Brethren, and exert yourselves, that that Friendship may be well established and finished between us.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>If you will be strong, it is in your Power to finish that Peace and Friendship well.</P>
<P>Now, Brethren, we desire you to be strong, and establish and make known to all the <HI>English</HI> of this Peace and Friendship, that it, over all, may be well established, as you are of one Nation, and one Colour, in all the <HI>English</HI> Governments.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>When you have made this Peace, which you have begun, known every where amongst 
<PB N="12" REF="008156_0012_102E3E6177F8B858"/>
your Brethren, and have finished and agreed every where together on this Peace and Friend∣ship, then you will be pleased to send it to me at <HI>Allegheny.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>When you have settled the Peace and Friendship, and finished it well, and you send it to me, I will send it to all the Nations of my Colour; when I receive of you the Answer, and I have looked that every Thing is well done, so that I can send it to the Nations of my Colour, they all will join to it, and we all will hold it fast.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>When all the Nations join to this Friendship, then the Day will begin to shine clear over us. When we once hear more of you, and we join together, then the Day will be still, and no Wind or Storm will come over us to disturb us.</P>
<P>Now, Brethren, you know our Hearts, and what we have to say, be strong; if you do so, every Thing will be well; and what we have told you in this, all the Nations agree to join.</P>
<P>Now, Brethren, let the King of <HI>England</HI> know what our Minds are, as soon as possible you can.</P>

<P>As the Governor was going to close the Conference, <HI>Nichas,</HI> the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Chief, spoke for some Time, with great Vehemence, pointing frequently to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> was ordered to interpret it; but he desired to be excused, as it was about Matters purely relating to the <HI>Indians</HI> themselves, and desired Mr. <HI>Montour</HI> might interpret it; after some Pause, he said, perhaps it might be better if it was interpreted to the Governors, Councils, and Com∣missioners, in a private Conference. Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> was desired to mention this to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and know of them what they would chuse should be done, whether it should be interpreted now, or at a private Conference, and they answered now; but soon after they said, that, at the Request of Mr. <HI>Weiser,</HI> they consented that it should be interpreted in the Morning, at a private Conference.</P>

<P>Nichas, <HI>the</HI> Mohawk <HI>Chief, stood up, and, directing his Discourse to both Governors, said,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>WE thought proper to meet you here, to have some private Discourse about our Ne∣phew <HI>Teedyuscung.</HI></P>
<P>You all know that he gives out, he is the great Man, and Chief of Ten Nations, this is his constant Discourse. Now I, on Behalf of the <HI>Mohawks,</HI> say, we do not know he is such a great Man. If he is such a great Man, we desire to know who has made him so. Perhaps you have, and if this be the Case, tell us so. It may be the <HI>French</HI> have made him so. We want to enquire and know whence his Greatness arose.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="008156_0013_102DD04B21E72F18"/>Tagashata, <HI>on the Behalf of the</HI> Senecas, <HI>spoke next.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I, for my Nation, say the same that <HI>Nichas</HI> has said; I need not repeat it. I say we do not know who has made <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> this great Man over Ten Nations; and I want to know who made him so.</P>
<P>Assarandonguas <HI>spoke next, on Behalf of the</HI> Onondagoes.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am here to represent the <HI>Onondagoes,</HI> and I say, for them, that I never heard, before now, that <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> was such a great Man, and much less can I tell who made him so. No such Thing was ever said in our Towns, as that <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> was such a great Man.</P>
<P>Thomas King <HI>spoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren the Governors, and all present,</HI></P>
<P>Take Notice that I speak in Behalf of Five Nations, who have their Deputies here pre∣sent, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Oneidoes, Cayugas, Tuscaroras, Nanticokes,</HI> and <HI>Conoys,</HI> who have joined to∣gether, and now make one Nation, and <HI>Tuteloes.</HI> We Five are all connected together, and if any Thing is said to one of us, it is communicated to all the rest.</P>
<P>On their Behalf I now tell you, we none of us know who has made <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> such a great Man; perhaps the <HI>French</HI> have, or perhaps you have, or some among you, as you have different Governments, and are different People. We, for our Parts, entirely disown that he has any Authority over us, and desire to know from whence he derives his Au∣thority.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Tokaaio, <HI>the</HI> Cayuga <HI>Chief, spoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I speak now to you, on Behalf of the Nations just now mentioned to you. You may re∣member, that you said the other Day, you could not be easy without your Prisoners were re∣turned. We have considered this, and I now assure you that they shall be returned.</P>
<P>We speak from the Bottom of our Hearts; we will look carefully into all our Towns for them. You shall have them all. We will keep none. It there he any of them that have gone down our Throats, we will throw them up again. You told us, a tender Father, Husband, Wife, Brother, or Sister could not sleep sound, when they reflected that their Re∣lations were Prisoners. We know it is so with us, and we will therefore use our Endeavours to make your Hearts easy, and we give you this Belt as a Promise, that we will perform our Words.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Nichas <HI>spoke next, in Behalf of the</HI> Mohawks, Senecas, <HI>and</HI> Onondagoes.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I speak now on Behalf of my own Nation, and my two other Brethren, Deputies of the <HI>Senecas</HI> and <HI>Onondagoes.</HI> We remember you desired us to leave nothing in our Hearts, but speak open on every Matter, and you said you would do the same to us.</P>
<P>You told us, that you could not sleep sound whilst your Prisoners were detained from you, nor could you have any Considence in the Friendship of those who did detain them.</P>
<P>We of these three Nations promise, that we will use our best Endeavours to make you ea∣sy. When we return, we will enquire of every Town for the Prisoners. We will call our Councils, and lay what you have said before them, and make diligent Enquiry for them through all our Towns, and all that we can find you shall see.</P>
<P>If any of them are gone down our Throats, we will heave them up again.</P>

<P>PRESENT, <HI>The</HI> GOVERNORS, <HI>and the Gentlemen of their Councils,</HI> &amp;cc.</P>
<P>THE Minutes of the preceding Conferences were read, and approved.</P>
<P>Those of Yesterday's private Conference were read at the particular Desire of the Chiefs of the <HI>Eight Nations,</HI> and interpreted to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> and the <HI>Delawares,</HI> in the <HI>Delawares</HI> Language, by Mr. <HI>Stephen Calvin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="008156_0014_102E3E66489DF690"/>The Governors then spoke separately; Governor <HI>Denny</HI> beginning as follow.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren, the</HI> Mohawks, Onondagoes, Senecas, Oneidoes, Cayugas, Tuscaroras, Nanticokes <HI>and</HI> Tuteloes,</P>
<P>In a Conference held with you Yesterday, you told me, that we know your Nephew <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> gives out, that he is the great Man, and Chief of ten Nations, and that this was his constant Discourse; by this Belt therefore you denied him to be so great a Man, and de∣sired to know of me who made him so, or gave him any Authority over you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I will answer you truly, and tell you, in a few Words, all that I know of the Matter; I have already informed you, that after the <HI>Delawares</HI> had struck us, you, our good Friends the <HI>United Nations,</HI> advised them to sit still, and do us no more Mischief; and that soon after this, we invited the <HI>Delawares</HI> to meet us at a Council Fire kindled at this Place.</P>
<P>We received an Answer to our Message from <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> as a Chief among the <HI>Delawares.</HI> At the Time appointed he came, and told us, that he represented ten Nations, amongst which the <HI>United Nations</HI> were included, that he acted as a chief Man for the <HI>Delawares,</HI> but only as a Messenger for the <HI>United Nations,</HI> who were his Uncles and Superiors; to whom he would faithfully carry every Thing that should be transacted between us, that they might do as they saw Cause.</P>
<P>We believed what your Nephew told us, and therefore made him a Counsellor and Agent for us, and desired him to publish to all Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> what we did at our Council Fires, and to let them know we were sincerely disposed to be at Peace with them.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I can only speak for myself, and do assure you, that I never made <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> this great Man, nor ever presented to give him any Authority over you; and I must do him the Justice to declare to you, that, at our former publick Treaties, <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> never assumed any such Power, but, on many Occasions, when he spoke of you, called you his Uncles and Su∣periors.</P>
<P>I never shall attempt to nominate or impose a Chief on any <HI>Indian</HI> Tribe or Nation, but, on all Occasions, will pay due Regard to those who are chosen by their Countrymen.</P>
<P>If any others have made <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> so great a Man, as to set himself above you, I am sor∣ry for it. It is more than I know, and they who have done it must answer for themselves.</P>
<P>I should be greatly concerned, that any Uneasiness should arise among you; and hope you will guard against it, and preserve that Harmony which ought to subsist between Friends and Relations.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt and String, you premised me to make diligent Search in your Towns for our Flesh and Blood, who are Prisoners among you, and return them to us.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We have always found you honest, and punctual in the Performance of your Promises; your Words therefore give me great Comfort, and fill all our Hearts with Pleasure.</P>
<P>We rely upon you that no Time may be lost in fulfilling an Engagement, on which our Peace and Quiet so greatly depend.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt and String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then Governor</HI> Bernard <HI>spoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren of all the Confederated Nations,</HI></P>
<P>As you proposed your Question, concerning <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> separately, I think it proper to give you a separate Answer thereto.</P>
<P>I know not who made <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> so great a Man, nor do I know that he is any greater than a Chief of the <HI>Delaware Indians,</HI> settled at <HI>Wyomink.</HI> The Title of King could not be given him by any <HI>English</HI> Governor; for we know very well, that there is no such Person among <HI>Indians,</HI> as what we call a King. And if we call him so, we mean no more than a Sachem or Chief. I observe, in his Treaties, which he has held with the Governors of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> (which I have perused since our last Meeting) he says he was a Woman till you made him a Man, by putting a Tomahawk in his Hand; and through all of those 
<PB N="15" REF="008156_0015_102E3E68C7FCE430"/>
Treaties, especially in the last, held at this Town, he calls you his Uncles, and professes that he is dependent on you; and I know not that any Thing has since happened to alter his Relation to you. I therefore consider him to be still your Nephew.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I heartily thank you for your kind Promises to return the Captives which have been taken from us. I hope you will not only do so, but will also engage such of your Allies and Ne∣phews, who have taken Captives from us, to do the same. That you may be mindful of this, I give you this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>After the Governors had done speaking, and their Answers were interpreted in the <HI>Six Nation</HI> and <HI>Delaware</HI> Languages, the <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs were asked if they had any Thing more to say; on which <HI>Tagaskata</HI> arose, and made a Speech to his Cousins the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Minisink Indians,</HI> directing his Discourse to <HI>Teedyuscung.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nephews,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember all that passed at this Council-Fire. The Governors who sit there have put you in Mind of what was agreed upon last Year. You both promised to return the Prisoners. We, your Uncles, put you in Mind of this Promise, and desire you will perform it. You have promised it, and you must perform it. We, your Uncles, have promised to return all the <HI>English</HI> Prisoners among us, and therefore we expect that you, our Cousins and Nephews, will do the same. As soon as you come home, we desire that you will search carefully into your Towns for all the Prisoners among you, that have been taken out of eve∣ry Province, and cause them to be delivered up to your Brethren. You know that this is an Article of the Peace that was made between you and your Brethren, in Confirmation of which you received a large Peace Belt; of which Belt we desire you will give an Account, and let us know what is become of it, and how far you have proceeded in it.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>After this was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, it was observed, that there were no <HI>Minisink Indians</HI> present; the Governors therefore desired Mr. <HI>Read</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> would procure a Meeting of the Chiefs of the <HI>United Nations,</HI> with the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and cause the Speech of <HI>Tagashata</HI> to be interpreted to the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> in the Presence of their Uncles.</P>
<P><HI>Robert White,</HI> the <HI>Nanticoke</HI> Chief, arose, and said he was going to speak in the Behalf of seven Nations, and, directing his Discourse to the Governors, he delivered himself in the <HI>English</HI> Language, as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It is now more than two Years past, since we heard of our Cousins the <HI>Delawares</HI> taking up the Hatchet against the <HI>English.</HI> At the first, Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> sent a Message to the Head Nations, and when they received it, they sent one to us at <HI>Otsaningo,</HI> telling us, that, as we lived close by our Cousins, they desired we would invite them to meet at our Town, and accordingly we invited them, and they came to a great Meeting at our Town of <HI>Otsaningo.</HI> We then gave our Cousins a Belt of a Fathom long, and Twenty-five Rows in Breadth, and desired them to lay down the Hatchet that they had taken up against the <HI>English,</HI> and to be easy with them; and if they would follow this Advice, we told them, that they would live in Peace, until their Heads were white with Age, otherwise it might not be so with them.</P>
<P>Not hearing from our Cousins of some Time, what they did in Consequence of this Belt, we sent to them two other Belts, one of Sixteen, and the other of Twelve Rows, desiring them once more to be easy with their Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> and not to strike them any more; but still we heard nothing from them: Indeed, some Time afterwards we understood the <HI>Dela∣wares</HI> should say, that the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Otsaningo</HI> had grey Eyes, and were like the <HI>English,</HI> and should be served as <HI>Englishmen</HI>; and we thought we should have had the Hatchet struck into our Heads. We now want to know what is became of these Belts; may be they may be under Ground, or they have swallowed them down their Throats.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As our Cousins have been loath to give any Answer to these Belts, we now desire they may let us know, in a publick Conference, what they have done with them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>At a</HI> CONFERENCE <HI>held at</HI> Easton, <HI>on the 18th of</HI> October, 1758.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, <HI>The</HI> GOVERNORS, <HI>Council, Gentlemen, and</HI> Indiana, <HI>with the Interpreters as before.</HI></P>
<P>MR. <HI>Read,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peters,</HI> acquainted the Governors, that, at a Meeting of the Chiefs of the Older and Younger Nations, with the several Tribes of the <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Mi∣nisink Indians</HI> on <HI>Monday</HI> Night, the Speech of <HI>Tagashata,</HI> delivered that Morning in the Publick Conference, respecting the giving up the Prisoners, was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language by <HI>Stephen Calvin</HI>; and another Belt, on the Part of the Governors, being joined to <HI>Tagashata</HI>'s Belt, they were both delivered to the <HI>Delaware</HI> and <HI>Minisink</HI> Chiefs, to en∣force the Matter. When this was done <HI>Tagashata</HI> spoke to the <HI>Minisink</HI> Chief, <HI>Egohohowen,</HI> saying, we were told by you that you had delivered up the <HI>English</HI> Prisoners, and we be∣lieved you: But our Brethren have told us that they were not delivered up; and therefore we earnestly desire that they may be made easy on this Article. You know, Cousins, that their Hearts will always be in Grief till they see again their Flesh and Blood. It is natural that they should be so. It would be so with us, if it was our Case. We desire you will be extremely careful to perform this Matter fully, and soon. Let there be perfect Peace, over all the <HI>English</HI> Country. And let it now be published, that we may all live in Peace, and with Satisfaction, now, and for ever. I told you, <HI>Egohohowen,</HI> when you was in my Town, to bring with you the <HI>English</HI> Prisoners, and that our Brethren would expect it. I wish you had done it. But however do it now with all Speed, and it will be well.</P>
<P><HI>Egohohowen</HI> answered, it is true, I was at my Uncle's Fire, and I believe he desired me to bring the Prisoners down; but I suppose it was not interpreted to me, for I did not under∣stand it clearly, but I now understand it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Minisink</HI> and <HI>Delaware Indians</HI> were desired to collect all their Warriors together, and give them these Belts, and receive from them their Answer, it being necessary they should concur heartily in whatever should be concluded.</P>
<P><HI>Nichas,</HI> the <HI>Mohawk</HI> Chief, acquainted the Governors, that, as Counsellors, they had fi∣nished, having nothing to propose at this present Meeting. The Warriors were to speak now, and <HI>Thomas King</HI> was appointed to deliver their Words, who thereupon arose, and began with an Exhortation, as well to all concerned in publick Affairs, Governors and their Coun∣cils, and <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs and their Councils, as to Warriors of all Nations, White People and <HI>Indians,</HI> desiring all present to attend carefully to what was going to be related, as Matters of great Consequence, which would serve to regulate the Conduct of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> to each other. He added, that the Relation going to be made, had taken a great deal of Trou∣ble to put it into Order, and it was made on Information given by the several <HI>Indians</HI> now present, who were acquainted with the Facts. Brethren, we the Warriors have waited some Time, in Hopes our Counsellors would have taken this Matter in hand, but as they have not done it, we have, at their Desire, undertaken it, and they have approved of every Thing. I say, the Counsellors of the Five Younger Nations, as well as the Three Older Nations, have approved of what the Warriors are going to relate; and take Notice, that the Speech is not only the Speech of all the Warriors of the Elder and Younger Nations, but of our Cousins the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Minisinks.</HI></P>
<P>This was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language; and <HI>Thomas King</HI> then proceeded, direct∣ing his Speech to the Governors, and all the <HI>English</HI> upon the Continent.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have been inquisitive to know the Cause of this War; you have often enquired among us, but perhaps you did not find out the true Cause of the Bitterness of our Hearts, and may charge us wrong, and think that you were struck without a Cause by some of our own War∣riors, and by our Cousins. But if you look a little about you, you will find that you gave the first Offence. For in Time of profound Peace, some of the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> passing through <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> to go to War with their Enemies, were taken up, and put in Prison. The <HI>English</HI> knew they were going to War, and that they used to do it every Year; and yet, after they had persuaded them in a friendly Way into their Houses, they were taken up, and put into Prison, and one, who was an Head Man of that Nation, lost his Life, and the others were severely used. This first raised Ill-will in the Minds of the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> and as the <HI>French</HI> came a little after this happened to settle on the <HI>Ohio,</HI> the <HI>Shawanese</HI> complained of it to them, and they made an artful Use of it, set them against the <HI>English,</HI> and gave them the 
<PB N="17" REF="008156_0017_102E3E6DD7590530"/>
Hatchet. Being resolved on Revenge, they accepted it, and likewise spoke to their Grand∣fathers the <HI>Delawares,</HI> saying, Grandfathers, Are not your Hearts fore at our being used so ill, and at the Loss of one of our Chiefs? Will not you join us in revenging his Death? So by Degrees our young Men were brought over to act against you. On searching Matters to the Bottom, you will find that you, in this Manner, gave the first Offence. This we thought proper to let you know. It may be of Service for the future. You may be induced by this to take better Care in conducting your Council Business, so as to guard against these Breaches of Friendship; or, as soon as they happen, in corresponding immediately with one another, and with the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations, who are in any wise concerned, on such Occasions.</P>
<P><HI>Eight Strings of black Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>This was the Case of the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> that I have just now related. Another of the like Nature has since happened to the <HI>Senecas,</HI> who have suffered in the same Manner.</P>
<P>About three Years ago, eight <HI>Seneca</HI> Warriors were returning from War, through <HI>Virgi∣nia,</HI> having seven Prisoners and Scalps with them; at a Place called <HI>Green Briar,</HI> they met with a Party of Soldiers, not less than One Hundred and Fifty, who kindly invited them to come to a certain Store, and said, they would supply them with Provisions; and accordingly they travelled two Days with them in a friendly Manner, and when they came to the House, they took their Arms from the <HI>Senecas</HI>: The head Men cried out, here is Death; defend yourselves as well as you can, which they did, and two of them were killed on the Spot, and one, a young Boy, was taken Prisoner. This gave great Offence, and the more so, as it was upon the Warriors Road, and we were in perfect Peace with our Brethren. It provo∣ked us to such a Degree, that we could not get over it.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have justly demanded your Prisoners; it is right, and we have given you an Answer. And therefore, as we think this young Boy is alive, and somewhere among you, we desire you will enquire for him. If he be alive, return him; if you have swallowed him down your Throats, which perhaps may be the Cafe, let us know it, and we will be content. His Name is <HI>Squissatego.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Six Strings of white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Prethren,</HI></P>
<P>We have one Word more to mention of the same Nature, and which was the very Cause why the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Ohio</HI> left you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>When we first beard of the <HI>French</HI> coming to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> we immediately sent Word to the Governors of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Pennsylvania</HI>; we desired them to come, and likewise to supply us with such Things as were proper for War, intending to defend our Lands, and hinder the <HI>French</HI> from taking the Possession of them. But these Governors did not attend to our Mes∣sage; perhaps they thought there was no Foundation for our Intelligence. The <HI>French,</HI> how∣ever, came, and became our Neighbours, and you neither coming yourselves, nor assisting us with warlike Stores, our People, of Necessity, were obliged to trade with them for what we wanted, as your Traders had left the Country. The Governor of <HI>Virginia</HI> took Care to settle on our Lands for his own Benefit; but when we wanted his Assistance against the <HI>French,</HI> he disregarded us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>At this Treaty you justly demanded to see your Flesh and Blood. We have pressed this on our Cousins the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and they, by this String, desired us to assure you, the Gover∣nors, that they would make strict Search in their Towns, and sincerely comply with your Request, and return all the Prisoners in their Power.</P>
<P><HI>Two Strings of black and white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P>Then directing his Discourse to the Governor of the <HI>Jersey,</HI> he proceeded.</P>
<P><HI>Brother, the Governor of</HI> Jersey,</P>
<P>Our Cousins the <HI>Minisinks</HI> tell us, they were wronged out of a great deal of Land, and the <HI>English</HI> settling so fast, they were pushed back, and could not tell what Lands belonged to them. If we have been drunk, tell us so. We may have forgot what we sold, but we trust to you the Governor of <HI>Jersey</HI> to take our Cause in Hand, and see that we have Justice done us. We say that we have here and there Tracts of Land, that have never been sold. You deal hardly with us; you claim all the wild Creatures, and will not let us come on your Land to hunt after them. You will not so much as let us peel a single Tree; this is hard, and has given us great Offence. The Cattle you raise are your own; but those which are wild, are 
<PB N="18" REF="008156_0018_102E3E706285B138"/>
still ours, and should be common to both; for our Nephews, when they sold the Land, did not propose to deprive themselves of hunting the wild Deer, or using a Stick of Wood, when they should have Occasion. We desire the Governor to take this Matter into his Care, and see Justice done in it.</P>
<P><HI>Two Strings of white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>All that has been said has been of one Nature, that is, of Matters that are Subjects of Dispute; this that I am now going to speak upon is of another Nature.</P>
<P>Then, directing himself to the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> he said,</P>
<P>We must put you in Mind, that four Years ago, you bought at <HI>Albany</HI> a large Tract of Land over <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> extending from the Mouth of <HI>John Penn's</HI> Creek to the <HI>Ohio.</HI> The Proprietaries Agents then paid <HI>One Thousand Pieces of Eight</HI> for the Part which was settled by your People, that have been since driven off and killed. We acknowledge to have received Pay∣ment for those Parts that were settled, but for the other Part that we have not received Pay∣ment for, that we reclaim. Our Warriors, or Hunters, when they heard that we had sold such a large Tract, disapproved our Conduct in Council; so now we acquaint you, that we are determined not to confirm any more, than such of the Lands as the Consideration was paid for, and were settled; tho' included in the Deed, they are our hunting Grounds, and we desire the Request may be granted, and Notice taken, that it was made in open Confer∣ence.</P>
<P><HI>Three white Strings.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Thomas King</HI> sat down.</P>
<P>The <HI>Six Nation</HI> Chiefs being asked if they had any Thing to say, answered, that they had done; and having eased their Minds of all that lay heavy upon them, they would re∣turn home.</P>
<P>The Governors promised attentively to consider what was said, and give them an Answer.</P>
<P>Teedyuscung <HI>then arose, and spoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I should have said something at the Time our Uncles laid before you their Grievances, or Causes of Complaint, in Behalf of my Countrymen who lived near <HI>Goshen.</HI> About three Years ago nine of their People were killed at <HI>Goshen,</HI> when they were in Peace. I will not take upon me to say that the Land had never been sold, but there was no Dispute about this at that Time. I verily believe that they killed those nine <HI>Indians,</HI> for no other Reason than because they were hunting on that Land. I speak to all the <HI>English</HI> when I mention this, as what was very wrong.</P>
<P><HI>Three white Strings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>One of the <HI>Waping</HI> Tribes, or <HI>Geshen Indians,</HI> tells me, that, as soon as those nine Men were killed, he went with three Belts, and Tears in his Eyes, to <HI>George Freeland</HI>'s, in order to have the Matter made up; but he never received an Answer to this Day, tho' he told him that he would send the Belts to the Governor, and as soon as he should receive his Answer, he would send for him, and let him know it; but he has never yet received any Answer.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I give you this String, to enquire what became of the three Belts, and what Answer was made to them.</P>
<P><HI>Three Strings of white Wampum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember we made Peace last Year, and a Peace Belt was made, a Fathom long, and of Fifteen Rows. Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> was present, so were some of my Uncles, and the <HI>Minisinks.</HI> They all saw it. You have asked me what is become of that Belt, and how far it went. I will tell you; I sent it up the <HI>Sasquehannah</HI> to <HI>Diahoga</HI>; from thence it went to <HI>Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in</HI>; thence to <HI>Secaughkung.</HI> The chief Men there got together to consider what was best to be done with it. They all concluded that it should be sent to our Uncle. He is a Man, and often told us he ought to see Things first, and consider what is to be done. The <HI>Senecas</HI> had the Belt the first, and then all the <HI>United Nations</HI> afterwards; they had it almost a Year. Now it is come back, and in <HI>Lapachpeton</HI>'s Hands, who is one of the <HI>De∣lawares,</HI> and lives at <HI>Secaughkung.</HI> How far the Peace Belt went, I don't know; but I suppose it went thro' all my Uncles, and I assure you I will do as my Uncle does. He has promised you he will deliver up all your Captives, and I assure you I will do so, whereso∣ever I find them, in all my Towns. Four Tribes, now present, have agreed to this, <HI>viz.</HI> <PB N="19" REF="008156_0019_102E3E74569791C0"/><HI>Delawares, Unamies, Mohiccons,</HI> and <HI>Wapings,</HI> who are settled as far as <HI>Secaughkung.</HI> This Belt confirms my Words.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I did let you know formerly what my Grievance was. I told you, that from <HI>Tohiccon</HI> as far as the <HI>Delawares</HI> owned, the Proprietaries had wronged me. Then you and I agreed that it should be laid before the King of <HI>England</HI>; and likewise you told me you would let me know, as soon as ever he saw it. You would lay the Matter before the King, for you said he was our Father, that he might see what were our Differences; for as you and I could not decide it, let him do it. Now let us not alter what you and I have agreed. Now let me know if King GEORGE has decided the Matter between you and me. I don't pretend to mention any of my Uncles Lands, I only mention what we the <HI>Delawares</HI> own, as far as the Heads of <HI>Delaware.</HI> All the Lands lying on the Waters that fall into the <HI>Sasquehan∣nah,</HI> belong to our Uncles.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> then took up another Belt, designing to speak to his Uncles the <HI>United Na∣tions</HI>; but whilst he was delivering the above, their Chiefs had one after another left the Council, seemingly much displeased, he therefore declined speaking it.</P>

<P>THE Governors, having prepared their Answers, desired the <HI>Indians</HI> to meet, but they continued holding private Councils among themselves all that Day, till late in the Afternoon; and as the Governors were going to the Place of Conference, the <HI>Indians</HI> sent Mr. <HI>Weiser</HI> out of Council, to desire they would defer meeting till the next Morning, their own private Business not being finished.</P>

<HEAD><HI>At a private</HI> CONFERENCE <HI>with the</HI> Indians, <HI>held at</HI> Easton, October 19, 1758. P.M.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>His Excellency Governor</HI> BERNARD,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>The Commissioners of</HI> New-Jersey,</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>The Chiefs of the</HI> United Nations, <HI>and of the</HI> Minisinks <HI>and</HI> Wapings,</ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>HIS Excellency reciting the Request of the <HI>United Nations</HI> to him, to do Justice to their Nephews the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> concerning their Claims to Lands in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> said, he would make diligent Enquiry what Lands were remaining unsold by them; but as that would be a Work of Time and Expence, he wished that some Means could be sound to give them Satisfaction at this Meeting. The People of <HI>New-Jersey</HI> said, that they had bought all, or the greatest Part of the <HI>Minisink</HI> Lands; and the <HI>Minisinks</HI> said they had a great Deal of Land unsold.</P>
<P>He could not tell who was in the right; but would suppose there were some Lands un∣fold, and upon that Supposition would give them some Money, by Way of Consideration, for them, if they would propose a reasonable Sum; and desired they would advise about it, and give an Answer.</P>
<P>The <HI>United Nations</HI> said it was a very kind Proposal, and recommended it to the Confi∣deration of the <HI>Minisinks.</HI></P>
<P>The same Day <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> waited on Governor <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> at his House, bringing with him <HI>Isaac Stille,</HI> for his Interpreter, and his Grandson; and, in the Presence of Governor <HI>Ber∣nard,</HI> Mr. <HI>Andrew Johnson,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peters,</HI> acquainted the Governor, that the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> did not claim Lands high up on <HI>Delaware</HI> River; those belonged to their Uncles; and be thought proper to let the Governor know this, that there might be no Misunderstanding of what he had said in the publick Conference.</P>

<HEAD><HI>At a</HI> CONFERENCE <HI>with the</HI> Indians, <HI>held at</HI> Easton, October 20, 1758.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT, <HI>The</HI> GOVERNORS, <HI>Council, Gentlemen and</HI> Indians, <HI>with the Interpreters, as before.</HI></P>
<P>GOVERNOR <HI>Denny</HI> desired to know of <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> if he proposed to speak, as the abrupt Departure of the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Chiefs from the Conference Yesterday, had prevented him from finishing what he had to say.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> arose, and, addressing himself to the <HI>Six Nation Indians,</HI> said,</P>
<P><HI>Uncles,</HI></P>
<P>According to our old Custom, we used to speak to one another at home; but we are now met here on Business, I must speak to you in the Presence of the <HI>English</HI> Governors; and what I shall say, I desire both you the <HI>English,</HI> and my Uncles, who are here, will attend to.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Uncles,</HI></P>
<P>I take this Opportunity of speaking to you in the Presence of our Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> and two of their Governors; please to take Notice what I am going to say.</P>
<P><HI>Uncles,</HI></P>
<P>You may remember that you have placed us at <HI>Wyomink,</HI> and <HI>Shamokin,</HI> Places where <HI>Indians</HI> have lived before. Now I hear since, that you have sold that Land to our Brethren the <HI>English</HI>; let the Matter now be cleared up, in the Presence of our Brethren the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>I sit there as a Bird on a Bow; I look about, and do not know where to go; let me therefore come down upon the Ground, and make that my own by a good Deed, and I shall then have a Home for ever; for if you, my Uncles, or I die, our Brethren the <HI>English</HI> will say, they have bought it from you, and so wrong my Posterity out of it.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt</HI></P>
<P><HI>Governor</HI> Denny <HI>then requested the Attention of the</HI> Indians, <HI>and spoke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren, Chiefs and Warriors of the</HI> Six United Nations, <HI>and your Nephews, here assembled,</HI></P>
<P>I am much obliged to you for the Account you gave me the Day before Yesterday, <HI>of</HI> the true Cause of the Bitterness of your Hearts towards us, and the Reasons which induced some of your young Men first to strike us, and others to side with the <HI>French</HI> on the <HI>Ohio.</HI></P>
<P>The Advice you gave us, to take better Care and guard against any Breach of Friendship between us for the future, is very kind and wholsome; we will join with you, and endea∣vour to prevent the like Evils for the Time to come.</P>
<P>I promise you, that I will immediately send to the Governor of <HI>Virginia,</HI> to enquire after the <HI>Seneca</HI> Boy, <HI>Squissatego,</HI> who you say was left a Prisoner in his Country, and if he is alive, you may depend on his being returned to you.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By these Strings you put me in Mind, that the Proprietaries, four years ago, bought of you at <HI>Albany,</HI> a large Tract of Land over <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> from the Mouth of a Creek called <HI>Kayarondinhagh,</HI> or <HI>John Penn's Creek,</HI> to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> and were paid by the Proprietaries Agents <HI>One Thousand Pieces of Eight,</HI> as the Consideration Money for such Parts as were settled by our People; but that, as your Warriors disapproved of your Conduct in Council for making that Sale, you now reclaimed such of the Lands contained in that Grant, as you have not received a Consideration for.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Proprietaries of this Province have, on all Occasions, manifested their particular Regard for you; they prefer your Friendship and the publick Good to their own private Interest. Their former Conduct gives you no Room to doubt the Truth of this; what I am about to tell you is a further Confirmation of it; therefore give me your Attention, and listen to what I shall say. You may remember, that, at a Treaty you held with your good Friend Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> three Years ago, some of your wise men told him, that there were some among them who were dissatisfied with the Sale of the above Lands, made by them at <HI>Albany,</HI> and were desirous 
<PB N="21" REF="008156_0021_102E3E77635E3EB8"/>
that Part of it should be reserved for them, though the Proprietaries had purchased it fairly of them, and paid <HI>One Thousand Pieces of Eight,</HI> which was all they were to receive, till our People settled to the Westward of the <HI>Allegheny,</HI> or <HI>Appalaccian Hills.</HI> Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> represented this Matter to the Proprietaries, in your Behalf, whereupon they chearfully agreed to release to you all that Part of the Purchase you have reclaimed, and, by a Letter of Attorney, em∣powered <HI>Richard Peters,</HI> and <HI>Conrad Weiser,</HI> to execute a Deed to you for those Lands, on your confirming to them the Residue of that Purchase. On this Subject therefore you will please to confer with them, and settle the Boundaries between you, that they may release the Lands to you accordingly, before you leave this Place, and set your Minds at Ease.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for the Pains you have taken with your Nephews, to prevail with them to re∣turn us such of our Brethren as are Prisoners among them, and we depend on the speedy Per∣formance of their Promise.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have something to say to you which is of the utmost Importance to us all; it requires your particular Attention and Consideration. Providence has brought you and your Nephews to∣gether at this Meeting, Face to Face with us, that every Thing may be settled, and nothing remain, not so much as a Doubt, to create any Uneasiness in our Hearts hereafter. You know, Brethren, that there is an old Agreement between the Proprietaries and you, that you will not sell any of the Lands lying within this Province to any one but them, and they ne∣ver take Possession of Lands t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> they have bought them of the <HI>Indians.</HI> You know also, that the <HI>United Nations</HI> have sold Lands to the Proprietaries, which your Nephews the <HI>Delawares</HI> now claim as their Right. This is the Case with Regard to some Part of the Lands lying between <HI>Toiccon</HI> Creek and the Head of <HI>Delaware</HI> River, which <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> in your Hear∣ing, the Day before Yesterday, said, the Proprietaries had defrauded him of. The Proprie∣taries are desirous to do strict Justice to all the <HI>Indians,</HI> but it cannot be supposed they can know in which of you the Right was vested. It is a Matter that must be settled among your∣selves; till this is done, there will probably remain some Jealousy and Discontent among you, that may interrupt both your and our future Quiet, which we should guard against by all Means in our Power.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I now acquaint you, that a Store of all Sorts of Goods for your Use is opened at <HI>Shamokin,</HI> where the <HI>Indians</HI> may be supplied, at the most reasonable Rates, with any Goods they want, and the best Prices will be given to you for such Skins, Furs and Peltry, as you shall bring them. Another Store is intended to be opened at <HI>Fort Allen,</HI> and you may depend upon it that such Persons will be placed there, who shall use you with the strictest Justice in all their Dealings.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyuscung,</P>
<P>As I understood at our last Meeting, that you were prevented at that Time, by the Absence of some of the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Chiefs, from finishing what you then had to say, I defer an∣swering, for the present, such Parts of your Speech as relate to me. But I shall soon take an Opportunity of doing it.</P>
<P>This was interpreted to the <HI>Delawares</HI> by <HI>Isaac Stille.</HI></P>
<P>After the Governor had done speaking, <HI>Tagashata</HI> and <HI>Nichas</HI> arose, and said, they did not rightly understand that Paragraph relating to the Lands, and requiring them to settle Matters among themselves; they said the Governor had left Matters in the Dark; they did not know what Lands he meant. If he meant the Lands on the other Side of the Mountain, he knew the Proprietaries had their Deeds for them, which ought to be produced and shewn to them. Their Deeds had their Marks, and when they should see them, they would know their Marks again.</P>
<P>And then <HI>Conrad Weiser</HI> being desired to bring the Deed, Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> informed the <HI>Indians</HI> he was going to speak to them; on which they acquainted him, that they chose to be spoke to by one Governor only at a Conference; for that when they both spoke, their Belts were mixed, and they were thereby confused in their Councils. Whereupon he deferred his Speech to another Time.</P>
<P>The Deed was then produced to the <HI>Indians,</HI> and <HI>Nichas</HI> said, this Deed we well remem∣ber; we know our Chiefs who signed it; some of them are present now; we sold the Land, and were honestly paid for it; the Land was ours, and we will justify it. They were desired 
<PB N="22" REF="008156_0022_102E3E79E8F6E870"/>
to take it with them into their Council Room, and confer on it, and settle the Matter among themselves.</P>
<P><HI>The Conference then broke up.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> having Yesterday requested of the Governor, that two Belts, which he then presented to him, might be sent as their joint Belts to the <HI>Ohio Indians:</HI></P>
<P>This Day the Chiefs of the <HI>United Nations,</HI> and <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> had a Meeting with two Members of Governor <HI>Denny</HI>'s Council, at which the following intended Answer from Go∣vernor <HI>Denny</HI> to the <HI>Ohio Indians,</HI> being first interpreted to the <HI>Indians,</HI> was considered, set∣tled, and approved by all present.</P>
<P><HI>Governor</HI> DENNY'<HI>s Answer to the Message of the</HI> Ohio Indians, <HI>brought by</HI> Frederick Post, Pisquitomen, <HI>and</HI> Thomas Hickman.</P>
<P>BY this String, my <HI>Indian</HI> Brethren of the <HI>United Nations</HI> and <HI>Delawares,</HI> join with me in requiring of the <HI>Indian</HI> Councils, to which these following Messages shall be pre∣sented, to keep every Thing private from the Eyes and Ears of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We received your Message by <HI>Pisquitomen</HI> and <HI>Frederick Post,</HI> and thank you for the Care you have taken of our Messenger of Peace, and that you have put him in your Bosom, and protected him against our Enemy <HI>Onontio</HI> and his Children, and sent him safe back to our Council Fire, by the same Man that received him from us.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I only sent <HI>Post</HI> to peep into your Cabbins, and to know the Sentiments of your old Men, and to look at your Faces, to see how you look. And I am glad to hear from him that you look friendly, and that there still remains some Sparks of Love towards us. It is what we believed before-hand, and therefore we never let slip the Chain of Friendship, but held it fast on our Side, and it has never dropped our of our Hands. By this Belt we desire you will dig up your End of the Chain of Friendship, that you suffered, by the Subtilty of the <HI>French,</HI> to be buried.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It happened that the Governor of <HI>Jersey</HI> was with me, and a great many <HI>Indian</HI> Brethren, sitting in Council at <HI>Easton,</HI> when your Messengers arrived, and it gave Pleasure to every one that heard it; and it will afford the same Satisfaction to our neighbouring Governors, and their People, when they come to hear it. I shall send Messengers to them, and acquaint them with what you have said.</P>
<P>Your requesting us to let the King of <HI>England</HI> know your good Dispositions, we took to Heart, and shall let him know it, and we will speak in your Favour to His Majesty, who has, for some Time past, looked upon you as his lost Children. And we can assure you, that, as a tender Father over all his Children, he will forgive what is past, and receive you a∣gain into his Arms.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>If you are in Earnest to be reconciled to us, you will keep your young Men from attack∣ing our Country, and killing and carrying Captive, our Back Inhabitants. And will likewise give Orders that your People may be kept at a Distance from <HI>Fort Duquesne,</HI> that they may not be hurt by our Warriors, who are sent by our King to chastise the <HI>French,</HI> and not to hurt you. Consider the commanding Officer of that Army treads heavy, and would be very sorry to hurt any of his <HI>Indian</HI> Brethren.</P>
<P><HI>A large Pelt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The Chiefs of the <HI>United Nations,</HI> with their Cousins, our Brethren the <HI>Delawares,</HI> and others now here, jointly with me send this Belt, which has upon it two Figures that represent all the <HI>English,</HI> and all the <HI>Indians</HI> now present, taking Hands, and delivering it to <HI>Pisquito∣men,</HI> and we desire it may be likewise sent to the <HI>Indians,</HI> who are named at the End of these Messages

<P><HI>Brethren on the</HI> Ohio,</P>
<P>If you take the Belts we just now gave you, in which all here join, <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> as we don't doubt you will; then, by this Belt, I make a Road for you, and invite you to <PB N="23" REF="008156_0023_102E3E7B70679618"/>come to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to your first old Council Fire, which was kindled when we first saw one another; which Fire we will kindle up again, and remove all Disputes, and renew the old and first Treaties of Friendship. This is a clear and open Road for you; fear therefore nothing, and come to us with as many as can be, of the <HI>Delawares, Shawanese,</HI> or of the <HI>Six Nation Indians.</HI> We will be glad to see you; we desire all Tribes and Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> who are in Alliance with you, may come. As soon as we hear of your coming, of which you will give us timely Notice, we will lay up Provisions for you along the Road.</P>
<P><HI>A large white Belt, with the Figure of a Man at each End, and Streaks of black, representing the Road from the</HI> Ohio <HI>to</HI> Philadelphia.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Six Nation</HI> and <HI>Delaware</HI> Chiefs join with me in those Belts, which are tied to∣gether, to signify our Union and Friendship for each other; with them we jointly take the Tomahawks out of your Heads, and bury them under Ground.</P>
<P>We speak loud, so as you may hear us; you see we all stand together, joined Hand in Hand.</P>
<P><HI>Two Belts tied together.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs being asked, if it would not be proper to insert in the Message an Ac∣count of the Situation of our Army to the Westward, and to desire them to join General <HI>Forbes,</HI> against the <HI>French</HI>; they replied, that they would by no Means advise this Govern∣ment so soon to press them to take up the Hatchet, because their Wounds were not yet heal∣ed, nor Peace made, which must first be done. They said further, that as the <HI>French</HI> had many <HI>Indians</HI> fighting for them, and they by Intermarriages were related to the <HI>Indians</HI> who sent the Messages, it could not be expected they would easily be persuaded to join the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est they should kill their own Flesh and Blood, adding, that the only proper Measure that could now be taken, was to advise them to sit still, and keep out of the Way, and this Advice they believed would be hearkened to.</P>
<P>They then desired, that at least two of our Inhabitants might accompany <HI>Pisquitomen</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hickman,</HI> the two Messengers, to the <HI>Ohio.</HI> The <HI>Six Nation</HI> Chiefs promised to send two of their own People with them; and <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> said he would send one, it not two <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>

<ITEM>STEPHEN CALVIN, <HI>Interpreter of the</HI> Delaware <HI>and</HI> Minisink <HI>Languages.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>HIS Excellency informed them, that he met them to agree about the Price of the un∣certain Claims of the <HI>Minisinks, Wapings,</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> Claimants of Land in the Northern Parts of the Province of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and desired that it might be considered, that they knew not what they sold, and he knew not what he bought; therefore the Price ought not to be large.</P>
<P>That they might propose a Sum to him, or he would make an Offer to them; or it should be left to their Uncles to confider of a Price, as would please them best.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mingoes,</HI> or <HI>Six United Nations,</HI> by <HI>Thomas King,</HI> said, that the <HI>United Nations</HI> had no Claim to the Lands of the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> or others their Nephews, on the East Side of <HI>De∣laware,</HI> and should therefore leave the fixing a Price to them.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Minisinks</HI> and <HI>Wapings</HI> withdrew to consult upon it; and being returned, <HI>Ego∣hohowen,</HI> the <HI>Minisink</HI> Chief, said, they would chuse the Governor should make an Offer, as they might perhaps demand too much.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="008156_0024_102E3E804698D7C0"/>His Excellency, having consulted the Commissioners, offered them <HI>Eight Hundred</HI> Spanish <HI>Dollars</HI> for their Claim in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> as an extraordinary Price.</P>
<P>The <HI>Minisinks</HI> said, they should be glad of the Opinion of their Uncles in the Matter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mingoes,</HI> or <HI>United Nations,</HI> by <HI>Thomas King,</HI> said, that it was a fair and honourable Offer, and that if it were their own Case, they would chearfully accept of it; but as there were a great many Persons to share in the Purchase-money, they recommended it to his Ex∣cellency to add <HI>Two Hundred Dollars</HI> more; and if that was complied with, the Report of it would be carried to all the Nations, and would be a great Proof of the Affection and Ge∣nerosity of their Brethren the <HI>English</HI> on this Occasion, and would be very agreeable to them.</P>
<P>His Excellency desired to know of the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and other Claimants, if they approved of the Proposal of their Uncles, and they informed him that they did.</P>
<P>The Governor, after consulting the Commissioners, said, it was more than he had intended to give; but as the <HI>United Nations</HI> had given themselves the Trouble of being Med<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tors be∣tween them, he could not refuse their Recommendations, and was glad of the Opportunity he had of shewing his Regard to the <HI>United Nations,</HI> and his Benevolence to the <HI>Minisink</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> who had resided in the Province where he presided, and therefore complied with their Request.</P>
<P>His Excellency then desired them to remember, that this Consideration Money was to be in full for the Claims of all the <HI>Minisink</HI> and <HI>Waping Indians,</HI> and all others who claim any Lands in a Map, which was laid before them at the same Time, which included all the Lands from the Line between the Provinces of <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and down <HI>Hud∣son</HI>'s River, to the Mouth of <HI>Rariton,</HI> up the same to <HI>Laometang</HI> Falls, on the North Branch of <HI>Rariton</HI> River; thence on a strait Line to <HI>Paeoqualin</HI> Mountain, where it joins on <HI>Dela∣ware</HI> River; and thence up the <HI>Delaware</HI> to <HI>Cushyhink</HI>; and recommended it to them to have respect to this in the Division of the Consideration Money.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Tagashata,</HI> the <HI>Seneca</HI> Chief, arose, and, addressing himself to the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and other <HI>Indian</HI> Claimants, spoke as follows.</P>
<P><HI>My Nephews,</HI></P>
<P>I desire you will now give over all Thoughts of your Land, and that we may hear no more Complaints about it.</P>
<P>Now you must remember the Friendship between you and your Brother, and transmit it to your Children; and make them acquainted with the Transactions of this Day. I recom∣mend this to you, not from my Lips only, but from the Bottom of my Heart. I hope it will also make a deep Impression in your Hearts.</P>
<P>It seems as if your Grandfathers had not told you of the Treaties they used to have with their Brethren, but carried them with them to the Grave. But we hope you will not do so, but carefully inform your Children of your Agreements. We have given you this Advice, and hope you will follow it. We also expect you will take Care of your young Men, that they do no more Violence to their Brethren the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Egohohowen</HI> then addressed himself to the Governor, and desired to be heard.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We are now thoroughly satisfied, and we still retain a Friendship for our Brethren the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> and we desire, that if we should come into your Province to see our old Friends, and should have Occasion for the Bark of a Tree to over a Cabbin, or a little Refreshment, that we should not be denied, but be treated as Brethren; and that your People may not look on the wild Beasts of the Forest, or Fish of the Waters, as their sole Property, but that we may be admitted to an equal Use of them.</P>
<P>The Governor answered, that, as soon as he got home, he should issue a Proclamation to notify to the People of his Province, that he had made a Peace with them; and to order, that, for the future, they should be treated as Brethren, which he hoped would be done; but desired that they would not go into those Parts where they had lately committed Hostili∣ties, till the Peoples Passions were cooled; for he could not be answerable for his Peoples Behaviour, whilst their Losses were fresh upon their Minds.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="008156_0025_102E3E81D98D9C58"/>On the 21st of <HI>October</HI> the Members of the <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> Council received a Message from Mr. <HI>Weiser,</HI> that the Chiefs of the <HI>United Nations</HI> were met in Council, with their Nephews the <HI>Delawares,</HI> at the House of <HI>Nicholas Scull,</HI> and that the <HI>Delawares</HI> had something to say to their Uncles, which they desired some of the Members of that Council, and Commission∣ers, should be Witnesses of, and hear.</P>
<P>Messieurs <HI>Growdon, Chew,</HI> and <HI>Misslin,</HI> attended accordingly, with Messieurs <HI>Galloway, Fox,</HI> and <HI>Hughes,</HI> Commissioners, and <HI>Israel Pemberton, Isaac Zane,</HI> and some other <HI>Qua∣kers,</HI> who were present at this particular Request of the <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>

<P>Teedyuscung, <HI>on Behalf of the</HI> Delawares, <HI>arose, and spoke as follows.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Uncles,</HI></P>
<P>I DESIRE you will hear me. We have gone so far at this Treaty as to talk of Lands; I therefore thought proper to meet you here, to let you know that I have consulted with all my Brethren, your Cousins, here present, about the Deed you, our Uncles, signed to the Proprietaries of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> shewn to us Yesterday, for the Lands beyond the <HI>Kittochtinny</HI> Hills.</P>
<P>We have seen the Deed, and know it well. <HI>Nutimus,</HI> one of our Chief Men, has sign∣ed it, and here sits one of our Men, named <HI>Philip Compass,</HI> who was present when the Sale was made; and remembers that <HI>Nutimus,</HI> our Chief, received <HI>Forty-four Dollars,</HI> as his Part or Share of the Consideration Money. We agree to it, and acknowledge that the Land was fairly sold. We give it up, and now confirm it. Let there be no Difference, nor any Thing more said about it. This is not the Land I have disputed with my Brethren the <HI>Eng∣lish.</HI> That Land lies between <HI>Tohiccon</HI> Creek and the <HI>Kittochtinny</HI> Hills.</P>
<P><HI>Gave a String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tokaaion,</HI> the <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, stood up and spoke as follows, addressing himself to <HI>Teedyus∣cung.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cousin,</HI></P>
<P>I thank you for your Openness and Honesty on this Occasion, freely to declare the Truth. We wish our Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> naming the Governors of <HI>Pennsylvania, Virginia, Caro∣lina</HI> and <HI>Jersey,</HI> were so honest and precise.</P>
<P>They have called us down to this Council Fire, which was kindled for Council Affairs, to renew Treaties of Friendship, and brighten the Chain of Friendship. But here we must hear a Dispute about Land, and our Time is taken up, but they don't come to the chief Point.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> first began to do Mischief; we told them so. They only thanked us for our Openness and Advice, and said they would take Care for the future, but healed no Wounds. In short, when they speak to us, they do it with a shorter Best or String than that which we spoke to them with; tho' they can make Wampum, and we cannot.</P>
<P>They ought not thus to treat with <HI>Indians</HI> on Council Affairs. Several of our strong Belts are lost in their Hands entirely. I fear they only speak from their Mouth, and not from their Heart.</P>
<P>On the same Day, <HI>P. M. Pisquitomen</HI> and <HI>Thomas Hickman</HI> came to take their Leave of the Governor, accompanied with Captain <HI>Bull, William Hayes,</HI> and <HI>Isaac Stille,</HI> the Persons appointed to attend them to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> who were particularly recommended to their Care and Protection by a String of Wampum.</P>
<P>The Belts and Strings were numbered, as well in the written Paper containing the Mes∣sages, as on Labels tied to each of them, and delivered to <HI>Pisquitomen,</HI> and the written Message was delivered, with the Passports, to Captain <HI>Bull.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="008156_0026_102DD04980338380"/>The 22d of <HI>October,</HI> the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Chiefs held a private Council, and named two of their People to send to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> viz. <HI>Tojenontawoby,</HI> a <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, and the youngest <HI>Shick Calamy,</HI> who joined <HI>Pisquitemen,</HI> and set off this Afternoon. As they were setting out, Mr. <HI>Frederick Post</HI> arrived with News from General <HI>Forbes,</HI> that a large Body of <HI>French</HI> and <HI>In∣dians,</HI> having attacked his advanced Post at <HI>Loyal Hanning,</HI> were repulsed with great Loss on their Side; which News he communicated to the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>

<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Now we have healed your Wounds, we, by this Belt, renew all our Treaties; we bright∣en the Chain of Friendship; we return to our first Affection; we confirm our ancient Union; we put fresh Earth to the Roots of the Tree of Peace, that it may bear up against every Storm that can blow, and live and flourish to the End of Time, whilst the Sun shines, and the Rivers run. And we desire you would publish it among your own, and all other <HI>Indian,</HI> Nations, who are your Friends and Allies, and engage them to join with you in a firm Peace with His Majesty, and all His Subjects; in whose Behalf I give you this Belt.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We now open a Road to the old Council Fire, which was kindled by your and our Fa∣thers in the City of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>Be assured, that you will always find this Road open, easy and pleasant to travel in, and, for the feature, whenever Occasion calls, we shall be glad to see you there.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> United Nations, <HI>and all our other Brethren, your Cousins and Nephews,</HI></P>
<P>We thank you for the Care and Diligence with which you have attended to the several Matters recommended to you in these Conferences, which has yielded us Abundance of Satisfaction.</P>
<P>This Treaty will convince all our Enemies, that we are now united in the firmest Band of Amity; and whilst we join our Strength together, it will not be in their Power to hurt either you or us.</P>

We give it with an hearty Good-will.</P>

<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyuscung,</P>
<P>By this Belt you put me in Mind, that we formerly referred our Dispute about Lands to our Father King GEORGE, and you desired to know if he has decided it.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You should consider the Circumstances of the Affairs of your Father King GEORGE; His Majesty lives at a very great Distance from us, is now engaged in a War with the <HI>French,</HI> and the Business of War takes up a great deal of Time and Attention; besides, in Time of War, we have but few Opportunities of hearing from him.</P>
<P>As yet I have had no Answer relative to your Affairs. You may depend upon it, as soon as I receive one, it shall be communicated to you. And I can assure you, the Proprietaries have pressed Dispatch, and will do every Thing they can to bring it to a speedy Determination.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>Then Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> requesting the Attention of the <HI>Indians,</HI> addressed them as fol∣lows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> United Nations,</P>
<P>By this String you spoke on Behalf of our Brethren the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> and said that they were wronged in their Lands; that the <HI>English</HI> settled so fast, that they were continually pushing them back; and when they asked for their Lands, they were told that they had sold their Lands, and had got drunk, and forgot it. If they had swallowed their Lands, they must be content, but they did not believe that they had swallowed all, but that some was left. They desired that I would enquire after their Lands that were left, and do them Justice.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am glad I have an Opportunity, in the Presence of so many Nations, to express the De∣sire I have of doing Justice to every one. The Throne of the Great King it founded on Justice, and I should not be a faithful Servant to him, if I neglected to give Redress to all Persons that have received Injuries from the People over whom the Great King has placed me.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="008156_0028_102E3E8AAABF86F8"/>I have therefore had a Conference with the <HI>Minisinks,</HI> in the Presence of some of their Uncles, and have come to a full Agreement with them; the Proceedings of which are now ready to be read to you.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have another Proof to give you of the Uprightness and Justice of our Province. We have come to an Agreement with the <HI>Delaware Indians,</HI> and other <HI>Indians,</HI> for the uncertain Claims they had on the Southern Parts of our Province; I hereby produce the Deeds that have been executed on this Occasion, that the Subject of them may be explained to you, and be had in perpetual Remembrance by all the Nations present; and I desire that you may all remember, that, by these two Agreements, the Province of <HI>New-Jersey</HI> is entirely freed and discharged from all <HI>Indian</HI> Claims. In Confirmation of which I give you this Belt.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother</HI> Teedyuscung,</P>
<P>By this String you tell me, that, after the killing the nine <HI>Indians</HI> near <HI>Esopus,</HI> you carried three Belts to <HI>George Freeland,</HI> who undertook to give them to the Governor, and you ask what is become of those Belts.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I can only say, that I never heard of those Belts before; nor do I know what Governor <HI>George Freeland</HI> undertook to carry those Belts to. The proper Governor was the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI>; for in his Province was this Mischief committed. And probably the Gover∣nor of <HI>New-York</HI> had these Belts; for I have heard that he issued a Proclamation for appre∣hending the Perpretrators of this Fact. This Fact has been blamed by all good and wife Men; and I am glad it was not done by the People of my Province. I will acquaint the Governor of <HI>New-York</HI> with what you have said upon this Occasion, and I will enquire after those Belts, and give you an Answer.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>Governor <HI>Denny,</HI> being obliged to return to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> on urgent Business, took his Leave of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It gives me great Pleasure that the Business of this Treaty has been carried on with so much Satisfaction.</P>
<P>I am sorry I am now to inform you, that I am obliged to leave you, having received last Night an Express from General <HI>Forbes,</HI> who is now near the <HI>Ohio.</HI> My Business calls me to Town, I shall therefore leave Mr. <HI>Logan</HI> and Mr. <HI>Peters</HI> to transact the Remainder of the Business, and doubt not but they will act to your Satisfaction.</P>
<P>I assure you of my Affection for you, and wish you all Manner of Happiness.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> arose, and desired to be heard on Behalf of the <HI>Wapings,</HI> or <HI>Wapinger Indians,</HI> called the <HI>River Indians,</HI> living near <HI>Esopus,</HI> and produced a short broad Belt of white Wam∣pum, having in the Center two Hearts, of a reddish Colour, and in Figures 1745, wrote after the following Manner, 17♥♥45. The Belt had a round Circle Pendant, representing the Sun; he then produced two Certificates, one from Governor <HI>Clinton,</HI> and the other from Governor <HI>Hardy,</HI> both which were much in Favour of the <HI>Wapinger</HI> Tribe of <HI>Indians.</HI> He said the Belt was given them by the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and represented their Union, which was to last as long as the Sun should continue in the Firmament.</P>
<P><HI>Teedyuscung</HI> addressed Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> desiring, by a String of Wampum, that he would extend his Protection to the Tribe of the <HI>Wapings</HI>; and as their Chief was old and infirm, he requested the Favour of a Horse to carry him home, which was readily granted.</P>
<P><HI>Takeaghsado,</HI> or <HI>Tagashata,</HI> made the same Request to Governor <HI>Denny,</HI> which was like∣wise granted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Six Nation</HI> Chiefs consulted together, and, in a little Time, <HI>Nichas,</HI> in their Behalf, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> an Answer to the Speeches of the Governors, laying the Belts and Strings upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Order they were delivered, and repeating distinctly what was said on each of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> At the End of every Article he returned Thanks, and expressed the highest Satisfac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> particularly on the ratifying the Peace, and the large Belt given thereupon, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be sent to all the distant Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> to whom it would be very agreeable; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> likewise promised, that every Thing transacted in these Conferences, which, he again

said, had afforded him great Pleasure, should be laid before the great Council at <HI>Onondago,</HI> whose Answer should be carefully transmitted. He thanked Governor <HI>Bernard</HI> for making up all the Differences between the Government and the <HI>Minisink Indians,</HI> so much to their Satisfaction. He made an Apology for the Want of Wampum, and the Exchange of other Belts, to give in Confirmation of their Performance of the several Things mentioned in the Governor's Speeches, agreeable to <HI>Indian</HI> Customs. Then wished Governor <HI>Denny</HI> a good Journey.</P>

<P>The Circumstances of our Province have hitherto rendered us unable to give you any great Proofs of our Regard for you; but I shall endeavour to persuade my People to do you good Service for the future, by opening a Communication with you, which, if rightly ma∣naged, will be much to the Advantage of both People. And, for my own Part, I shall be always ready to do you Justice, and desire that whenever you have Cause of Complaint a∣gainst my People, you will take Care to signify it to me.</P>

<P>The <HI>Five Nation</HI> Chiefs having laid all the Belts and Strings on the Table, that were de∣livered at this and the last Conference, the <HI>Cayuga</HI> Chief, <HI>Tokaaio,</HI> desired the Governors, and all present, would hearken to what <HI>Thomas King</HI> was going to say on Behalf of the <HI>United Nations</HI> (now Eight in Number) on which <HI>Thomas King</HI> arose, and taking up the first Belt, which was given by <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> when he requested a Deed for the <HI>Wyomink</HI> Lands, he ad∣dressed the <HI>Delawares, Teedyuscung</HI> not being present, as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="008156_0031_102E3E913B02F2E8"/><HI>Cousins,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> desired us to make you the Owners of the Lands at <HI>Wyomink, Shamokin,</HI> and other Places on the <HI>Sqsquehannah</HI> River; in Answer to which, we who are present say, that we have no Power to convey Lands to any one; but we will take your Re∣quest to the great Council Fire, for their Sentiments, as we never convey or sell any Lands, before it be agreed in the great Council of the <HI>United Nations.</HI> In the mean Time you may make use of those Lands, in Conjunction with our People, and all the rest of our Relations, the <HI>Indians</HI> of the different Nations in our Alliance, which being interpreted in <HI>Delaware,</HI> the String of Wampum was given to <HI>Moses Tittamy,</HI> and <HI>James Davis,</HI> to be delivered to <HI>Teedyuscung,</HI> as he was not present.</P>
<P>Then taking up each Belt and String, in the Order it was delivered in this and the last Conference, he proceeded to repeat distinctly what had been said under each Article, return∣ing Thanks for all those good Speeches, which he said were extremely agreeable: He made particular Mention of the large Peace Belt, saying, the Nations were vastly pleased, that all the antient Treaties made here, at <HI>Albany,</HI> and elsewhere, were renewed, as well as that the old Council Fire at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> was kindled again, and a good Road made to it, that might be travelled without any Danger; these in particular, as well as every other Matter transacted at these Conferences, we will make known to our own Nations, and to every other in Friend∣ship and Alliance with us; and we are sure they will be very well received.</P>
<P>Then, addressing Governor <HI>Bernard,</HI> they thanked him for his Farewel Speech, saying, it was a very kind one, and that they were very glad at his having been present and given his Assistance at this Treaty, which had given them an Opportunity of gaining an Acquaint∣ance with him, which they would ever remember with Pleasure. After a Pause, he desired to be excused in mentioning something that had been omitted by the Governors and their Councils. You have forgot to bring with you Ammunition, of which we always used to re∣ceive a sufficient Quantity, not only to serve us in our Journey, but support us in our hunting Season, that we might be enabled to make Provision for our Families. You have given us Gun-Locks without Guns, which are of no Manner of Use to us; and therefore this must surely have been forgot, as it is impossible for <HI>Indians</HI> to subsist without Guns, Powder and Lead, of which we have received none.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As many of us are old and infirm, we desire our Brethren will be so good as to furnish us with a Number of Waggons to carry such of us as are not able to walk with the Goods you have been pleased to give us, as far as <HI>Wyomink,</HI> where we have left our Canoes, and then we will discharge the Waggons. We further desire a Supply of Provisions may be put into the Waggons, enough to serve us till we get to our respective Habitations.</P>
<P>He then took up the Proprietary Release, and returned Thanks for it. He said that, when the <HI>United Nations</HI> first made the Request to Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> to be transmitted to <HI>Onas,</HI> they had no Doubt but <HI>Onas</HI> would comply with it, having always found him ready to grant all their Requests; with him we have never had any Difference, he has always settled our Affairs without giving us any Trouble, and to our Satisfaction. We heartily thank <HI>Onas.</HI> This Act confirms us in the good Opinion we have always had of him.</P>
<P>Then, addressing himself to the <HI>Delawares,</HI> with a String of Wampum, he spoke as follows.</P>
<P>This serves to put <HI>Teedyuscung</HI> in Mind of his Promises to return the Prisoners. Remem∣ber Cousin, you have made this Promise in our Presence; you did it indeed before, and you ought to have performed it; it is a Shame for one who calls himself a great Man to tell Lies; let us, as Counsellors, perform our Engagements and Promises; Cousin, you must not now fail to perform your Word; we are all one People, and we must all of us be punctual in the Performance of our Engagements. This was interpreted in the <HI>Delaware</HI> Language, and the String was given to <HI>Moses Tittamy</HI> for <HI>Teedyuscung.</HI> He then said the <HI>United Nations</HI> had finished what they had to say.</P>
<P>Looking round the Room, he espied Mr. <HI>Vernon,</HI> the Person who had the Care of furnish∣ing the <HI>Indians</HI> with Provisions, and he desired, that, now Council Business was over, he might be ordered to take the Lock off the Rum, and let it run freely; that, as they were going away, their Hearts might me made glad, and we could very well spare it, as it was of no Use to us.</P>
<P>Some Wine and Punch was then ordered in, and the Conferences were concluded with great Joy and mutual Satisfaction.</P>
