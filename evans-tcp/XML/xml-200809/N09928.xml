<HEAD>The constitution of New-England CHURCHES, as settled by their Platform, may be fairly justified, from <HI>Antiqui∣ty</HI>; the <HI>Light of Nature; Holy Scripture</HI>; and from the <HI>Noble</HI> and <HI>Excellent Nature</HI> of the <HI>Constitution</HI> itself. And lastly from the <HI>Providence of GOD</HI> dignifying of it.</HEAD>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. To distribute the whole <HI>Christian Aera</HI> into three Parts may serve to raise a clearer light, and make a brighter aspect in this <HI>Essay.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE first division contains the first three hundred years of christianity, which may be accounted the most refined and purest time, both as to faith and manners, that the christian church has been honored with; for that within this space, is contained the ministry of the apostles and holy evangelists, and other eminent persons authorized by them; and such others who succeed∣ed in office-trust through the several ages, within the space before named. This was the time of an immense effusion of the Spirit of God upon the world, when there was such a flux and inundation of the waters from the sanctuary, mentioned, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 47. This was the age of miracles; a time of extraordinary gifts, and when grace and true piety was in the greatest elevation. Christian religion was now a dangerous business; every man that took it up, lay
<PB N="4" REF="012626_0003_0F8B8F030AF28938"/>
down his life, honor and fortune at stake; he that owns Christ, must bid defiance to all the celebrated deities of the Roman empire; and thereby run counter to the religi∣on of the imperial court. So that rationally we may ex∣pect to find the churches of Christ in the purest capacity they were ever in; in all points, both of principles and practice. That whatever their government was if they continue the same from the days of the apostles, we may fairly conclude it to be authentic, and agreable with their grand and original copy. It is most apparent, that the churches in those ages, were under too good an influence internally, and the eye of too direful a guard, externally to prevaricate with God, in the known principles of their order, any more than in their faith, though they were not without errors. Two or three hundred years, is a long time in the world, to keep up our constant mode and cus∣tom, either in religious or civil affairs amongst men, who are so inclined to err, and apt to change their fashions; <HI>Nam est Natura hominum Novitatis Avida,</HI> That for the churches through those many ages and in their several communities, to agree in their discipline amongst them∣selves; and not essentially to differ from those churches that were truely apostolical, invincibly infers, that their original was divine. But this will appear more plainly when we have made and finished our survey.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second grand division of time, contains the space of the next twelve hundred years, downward, more or less; within which circuit is included the commencement &amp; pro∣gress of a direful apostacy, both as to worship, and govern∣ment in the churches. Some symptoms of these things were rising within the former division of time; but in this they grew a great pace, and to that degree, that the chris∣tian world became a most notorious apostate. For as we have it in the idea of the reformation, the great Lord of time allowed a space, wearing the denomination of time, times, and half a time: or in plainer expressions, twelve hundred and sixty years; in which space, all the effects of a horrible apostacy made a very <HI>Gehennon</HI> of that which was called Christendom. And says Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> (in his preface, to the inquiry, into the original of the churches) <HI>Ambros</HI> judg∣ed, that it was the pride, or ambition of the doctors of the church, which introduced the alteration in its order. And
<PB N="5" REF="012626_0004_0F8B8F042D49B830"/>
moreover says the doctor, somewhat after this manner, viz. 'The ambition of church rulers, in the fourth and fifth centuries openly proclaimed itself to the scandal of the chris∣tian religion; for that their interest led them to a devia∣tion from the order and discipline of the church according to its first institution': For that the directions given about it in scripture, make it a matter so weighty in itself, and attended with so many difficulties, it being laid under such severe interdictions of lordly power, or seeking either of wealth or dignity; that it's no pleasant thing to flesh and blood, to engage in the conduct, and oversight of Christ's volunteers; to bear with their manners; to exercise pa∣tience towards them in all their infirmities; and in all their weaknesses, to continue a high valuation for them, as the flock of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood: All this requires abundance of self-denial; and if so, then it's no wonder, that many of their prelates were willing gradually to extricate themselves out of this uneasy condition; and embrace all opportunities of introducing another order into the churches, that might tend more to the exaltation of their own power and dignity. And this was done accordingly; for the bishops by their arbitrary rules shared the flock of Christ amongst themselves, and that without the consent of the people, as though they had conquered them by the sword. For thus they divide the spoil. This bishop say they, shall have such a share and number of them under his power; and that other bishop shall have so many; and so far shall the jurisdiction of one extend, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d so far another; that they soon canton out the whole Roman empire under a few patriarchs and head men. These things were the subject of their decrees and laws, which (those of Christ's being thrown by) were now become a rule for the churches. But yet neither did the bishops long keep within those bounds and limits, which their more modest ambition had at first prescribed unto them; but went on, and took occasion from these be∣ginnings to contend amongst themselves about pre-eminen∣cy, dignity, and power: In which contest, the bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> at length remained master of the field; and so <HI>Rome</HI> obtained the second conquest of the world. And then his holiness the head of it came to ride admiral of all the Sees; and then soon became lord of heaven and earth by the
<PB N="6" REF="012626_0005_0F8B8F04A71BB800"/>
same rule of process which brought him to his high trust. Hence, Query. What can't wakeful ambition, learning and fraud do, if jointly agreed, at rifling the greatest trea∣sures bequeathed to mankind; especially when the world is generally gotten into a sleepy fit.</P>
<P N="3">3. Towards the latter end of this space of time began a glorious reformation. Many famous persons, memorable in ecclesiastical history, being moved by the spirit of God, and according to holy writ, led the way in the face of all danger; such has <HI>Wickliff,</HI> who openly decryed the pope, as the very antichrist; in the fourteenth century, and others in that age. And in the next century <HI>Martin Luther</HI> pursued the reformation with great boldness, reso∣lution and constancy; this is that famous <HI>Luther,</HI> says my author, of whom they who acknowledge the least, must yet make as much as Dr. <HI>More</HI> makes of him; for saith the Dr.
<Q>I cannot think so very highly of <HI>Luther</HI> as some do; and yet I think him to have been a very happy instrument in the hand of God, for the good of Chris∣tendom against the horrid enormities of the papal hyrarchy. And though he might not be allowed to be the <HI>Elias,</HI> the conductor and chariot of <HI>Israel,</HI> as some have stiled him; yet I think at least he might be ac∣counted a faithful postilion in that chariot, who was well accoutred with his wax boots, oiled coat, and hood; and who turned the horses noses into a direct way from <HI>Babylon</HI> toward the ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of God, and held on in a good round trot, through thick and thin, not caring to bespat∣ter others in this high fogg, as he himself was finely bespattered by others:</Q>
About which time <HI>Zuinglius, Oecolampadius, Melancthon</HI> and other christian heroes also listed into the same quarrel, and with great bravery and self denial went forward with the reformation. Yet after the endeavours of such men, and others without number, through several ages downward; the churches, which are called reformed, attained to a very imperfect reformation, as Dr. <HI>Increase Matther</HI> says. And the defect has not been so much in doctrine, as in worship and discipline. And notwithstanding says the Dr. in this respect also, some churches have gone beyond others. Now to come to what I aim at; these churches in <HI>New-England,</HI> as to their order and discipline have surpassed all churches of the
<PB N="7" REF="012626_0006_0F8B8F06DA7C9808"/>
reformation. And under the head of discipline, it seems to me, that Christ the captain of salvation, has given out his word to these churches, as to his troops coming up in the reer of time; and his word of command is—as you were; make good the old front; or place your selves in that regimental order, which the primitive churches were in whilst they march't under my banners, and encountred the devil in their heathen persecutors for the first three hundred years. For that the churches in <HI>New-England,</HI> and the primitive churches are eminently parallel in their government. Those first ages of the church it is certain were many times much annoyed with many pestilent and damnable heresies; and many usages in worship, too superstitious crept in amongst them; yet they continued in the constitution of their church order very uniform and apostolical; and it is very obvious that these churches in this wilderness, in the essentials of government; are every way parallel to them.</P>
<P>I shall represent this business by a collection of parellel notes out of several authors of unquestionable veracity; and shall principally follow the guidance of one who has concealed his name; and stiles his treatise, 'An inquiry into the constitution, discipline, unity and worship of the primitive churches.' This author in his preface gives this fair account of his doings; says he, <HI>What I have written I have wholly collected out of the genuine, and unquestionably authentick writings of those ages</HI>; meaning such as writ in, or of the three first centuries of christianity. And says he, <HI>I have been every way honest and unbiast.</HI> And being well assured of his fidelity; I shall endeavour to imitate his faithfulness, in transcribing what I find in him suiting my present purpose. And I shall be well and sufficiently furnished when I have laid before the reader the notion which the ancients had of the church in its constituent parts both of officers and people, with the several authorities, powers, rights, immunities and prerogatives belonging unto each. And if we find that the primitive churches in their order and discipline, did exactly agree in the essenti∣als of government; with the churches in <HI>New-England</HI>; we may rationally then conclude that if they were aposto∣lical, so are we.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Church.</HEAD>
<P>TO pass over all other observations, the most usual and common acceptation of the word <HI>Church,</HI> of which we must chiefly treat, is that of a particular church; which consists of a society of christians, meeting together in one place, under their proper pastors, for the performance of religious worship, and the exercising of christian discipline. This description of a church is a∣greable with the <HI>Idiom</HI> both of scripture and antiquity. Thus <HI>Tertullian,</HI> who lived about the end of the second century, gives us an account of the state, order and wor∣ship of the churches. (<HI>Apol. ad Gen. Cap.</HI> 39.) The description of a church he first lays down in these words, <HI>viz. Corpus sumus de Conscientia Religionis, et Disciplinae Unitate, et Spei Foedere.</HI> We are a body united in the conscience of religion, or for the consciencious observation of the duties of religion; by an agreement in discipline, and in a covenant of hope. For whereas such a body, or religious society could not be united but by a covenant; he calls it a covenant of hope, because the principal respect therein was had unto the things hoped for. This religi∣ous body, or society thus united by covenant, did meet together in the same assembly, or congregation. For says he, <HI>Corpus sumus, Coimus in Coetum, et Congregationem ut ad Deum, &amp;c.</HI> We are a body, and meet in an assembly, and congregation, to offer up our prayers unto God, and attend the duties of the christian religion. So <HI>Iraeneus</HI> also in the second century, tells us, <HI>That some of the bre∣thren, and sometimes the whole church of some certain place,— by fasting and prayer have raised the dead.</HI> Thus our own platform agrees in sense with the opinion of the ancients. <HI>Plat. Ch.</HI> 2. <HI>Sect.</HI> 6. <HI>A congregational church, is by the in∣stitution of Christ, a part of the militant church, consisting of a company of saints by calling, united into one body by an holy covenant,</HI> &amp;c. But as to the independency, or real dis∣tinction between church and church; this will more clearly appear in what follows. Therefore I shall proceed to consider the constituent parts of a church, as divided,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="9" REF="012626_0008_0F8B8F09769436B8"/>1. Into the people who composed the body of the church, called the elect, or the called and sanctified by the will of God; and sometimes they are called the bre∣thren, because of their brotherly love, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. Into those persons who were set apart for office, or for a peculiar and ecclesiastical improvement. And each party under this distribution, had their particular immuni∣ties and employments. And under these heads, I shall confine the discourse to a parallel in the essentials in go∣vernment or church order, between the churches of Christ in the first ages of christianity, and the churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> as settled by their platform.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL proceed to distribute and enumerate the operations and immunities of the churches.</P>
<P N="1">1. With relation to the peculiar acts of the officers.</P>
<P N="2">2. The peculiar acts of the laity, or fraternity.</P>
<P N="3">3. The joint acts of them both; as performing the work and business of an organic church, or compleat corpora∣tion. And,</P>
<P N="4">4. I shall lastly make some observations upon the union of distinct churches, by acts of sisterly fellowship or com∣munion. And hereby I shall compleat the parallel, in the essentials of order, between the primitive churches, and those of this country.</P>
<P N="1">1. The peculiar acts of the officers or clergy. Under this head might be considered the functions of every parti∣cular order, and degree of the clergy; which we may say were according to the purest antiquity, but three, viz. bishops, priests or presbyters, and deacons. I shall princi∣pally consider the bishop as the chief officer in trust and dignity, in the primitive church. And in order to it,</P>
<P N="1">1. In general observe, that though there were some dis∣tinctions in point of a tetular dignity and degree between a bishop and presbyter; yet they were really equal in order, and in the nature of their trust. For that in an ecclesiastical sense, bishop and presbyters are synonimous terms, setting forth the same office; and signify no more but an elder, a pastor, ruler, or overseer of a church.
<PB N="10" REF="012626_0009_0F8B8F0BA90553D8"/>
<HI>Ignatius</HI> calls the apostles themselves the presbyters of the church; and <HI>Theodoret</HI> renders the reason of the appella∣tion, for saith he,
<Q>The holy scriptures called the chief men of <HI>Israel,</HI> the senate or eldership.</Q>
<HI>Wils. Dict.</HI> And indeed according to the apostle himself, presbyters, or elders, and bishop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, are plainly terms of office; and of equal signification. As in <HI>Tit.</HI> i. 5, 7. <HI>For this cause left I thee in</HI> Crete, <HI>that thou shouldest—ordain elders—For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In this dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourse I shall represent the bishop in the sense of the primitive chur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes, as head and chief officer of the church; for according to <HI>Cyprian,</HI> there was but one bishop, strickly so called, in a church at a time, though at the same time there were many elders or presbyters in the same church; and the bishop in a peculiar manner was related to his flock, as a pastor to his sheep and a parent to his children. <HI>Cyp. Epist.</HI> 38. § 1. <HI>p.</HI> 90. And the titles of this supreme church officer, are most of them reckoned up in one place, in <HI>Cyp. Epist.</HI> 96. <HI>viz.</HI> Bishop, pastor, president, governor, superintendant or priest. And this officer is he, which in the <HI>Revelation,</HI> is called, <HI>The angel of the church,</HI> as <HI>Origen</HI> thinks.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may consider more distinctly, the object of his care, or the dimensions of the boshops diocess. Its very obvious, that this great and superior officer, as has been said; had but one church under his pastoral care. The diocesses government or dominion of these reverend pre∣lates, are never (according to antiquity) said to contain churches, in the plural, but only a church, in the singular number. And the bishop was usually called the bishop of this or that church. As <HI>Tertullian</HI> saith, <HI>Polycarp</HI> was or∣dained bishop of the church of <HI>Smyrna, &amp;c.</HI> And more∣ever it is accurately to be observed, that the most frequent word used to denominate the extent of the bishops care, or to set out the limits of his diocess, was that of a parish. So in the synodical epistle of <HI>Irenaeus</HI> to <HI>Victor.</HI> The bishopricks of <HI>Asia</HI> are called parishes: and in the his∣tory of <HI>Eusebius,</HI> the word is so applied in several hundred pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es. It's very usual there to read of bishops of this and that parish. As the bishop of the parish in <HI>Alexan∣dria,</HI> the bishop of the parish in <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and in <HI>Corinth,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c. For that the word <HI>Paroikia,</HI> which we render <HI>parish,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="012626_0010_0F8B8F0C7A9C0B28"/>
signifies <HI>housing,</HI> or <HI>living</HI> together. And in ordinary and civil use, it notes a village, small town, or part of a town, of people or persons dwelling together. And in a church sense it signifies a competent number of christians dwelling near together, and having one bishop, pastor or minister, or more set over them; with whom they meet at one time or place, to worship and serve God. So that parish in this sense, is the same with a particular church or congregation. And this is plainly agreable with the sense, custom and platform of <HI>New-England</HI> churches.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the bishops diocess exceeded not the bounds of a parish, or a small town, or part of a town, is very evident from the following demonstrations, according to antiquity.</P>
<P><HI>Demonst.</HI> 1. For that all the people of a diocess did every Sunday, meet together in one place, to celebrate divine service. Thus saith <HI>Justin Martyr, (Apol.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 98.) All assemble together in one place, where the bishop preaches, and prays.</P>
<P><HI>Demonst.</HI> 2. The bishop had but one alter, or com∣munion-table in his diocess, at which his whole flock re∣ceived the sacrament from him. There is but one alter says <HI>Ignatius (Epist. ad Phila. p.</HI> 41.) as there is but one bishop. So says <HI>Cyprian,</HI> we celebrate the sacrament; the whole brotherhood being present. And thus it was in <HI>Justin Martyr's</HI> days. The bishops whole diocess met together on Sunday, when the bishop gave them the eucharist.</P>
<P><HI>Demonst.</HI> 3. All the people of a diocess were present at church censures; as <HI>Origen</HI> describes an offender, as appearing before the whole church. In <HI>Mat. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI> 13▪ <HI>Page</HI> 133. <HI>vol.</HI> 1. So <HI>Clemens Romanus</HI> calls the censures of the church, the things commanded by the multi∣tude.</P>
<P><HI>Demonst.</HI> 4. No offenders were restored again to the churches peace, without the knowledge and consent of the whole diocess; they were to plead their cause before the whole people, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Demonst.</HI> 5. When the bishop of a church was dead, all the people of that church met together in one place to chuse a new bishop. So <HI>Sabinus</HI> was chosen bishop of <HI>Emetria,</HI> by the suffrage of all the brotherhood. The
<PB N="12" REF="012626_0011_0F8B8F0CDD7F9708"/>
whole diocess of the bishops did meet together to manage church affairs. Thus when the schism of <HI>Felicissimus,</HI> in the bishoprick of <HI>Carthage</HI> was to be debated, it was to be done according to the will of the people, and by the consent of the laity. And when there were some hot dis∣putes about the restitution of the lapsed, <HI>Cyprian</HI> promised his whole diocess, that all those things should be examined before them, and judged by them. So that from the pre∣mises, it is very evident, that that diocess cannot possibly be more than one single congregation; nor that church more than a congregational church, where all the people and members of that church meet together at one time, and in one place to pray together, to receive the sacrament together; assist at church-censures together, and dispatch church affairs together. And it is very apparent, that this was the method and way of the primitive churches, according to the preceeding observations. And <HI>New-England</HI> churches harmonize exactly in their common practice, as tho' they had taken their directions from them.</P>
<P N="4">4. The bishops duty, or the several particular operations of his honourable office, were such as these, <HI>viz.</HI> preach∣ing of the word, praying with his people, administring the sacraments, taking care of the poor, ordaining of ministers, governing his flock, excommunicating of offenders, and absolving of penitents. In a word, whatever can be com∣prized under those three general heads of preaching, wor∣ship and government, were parts of the bishops function and office. And this also is very agreable with our plat∣form: <HI>Cap.</HI> 10. <HI>Sex.</HI> 8. The power which Christ hath committed to the elders, is to feed and rule the church of God, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. The Prerogatives, or Peculiar Immunities of the Laity.</HEAD>
<P>THE fraternity or body of the people had several high immunities inherent in them; and exercised by them as a church. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. Voting and giving their suffrage, for the admission and censure of members. To this purpose before.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="13" REF="012626_0012_0F8B8F0D8BACE058"/>2. The electing their own officers. For when a parish, or bishoprick was vacant through the death of the in∣cumbent, the members of that parish met in church to choose a fit person for his successor; to whom they might commit the care and government of the church. When <HI>Alexander</HI> was chosen bishop of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> it was by cum∣pulsion or choice of the members of that church. And so in the church of <HI>Rome</HI> when their bishop was deceased; all the people met in the church to choose a successor. <HI>Euseb. Lib.</HI> 6. <HI>cap.</HI> 28. Though it is certain that after some time the aspiring clergy rob'd the people of this as well as of other of their rights. As it is well represented by a late worthy anomolous author, writing <HI>de Ordinatione,</HI> p. 30. <HI>Crescente Paulatim Cleri Potestate ad se magis indies,</HI> &amp;c. The power of the clergy gradually increasing, they daily drew more new rights to themselves, which they took from the people; thinking that the dignity which they had obtained, was not ample enough, if the people had any share with them in elections. Therefore at length snatch or take the whole business into their own hands; the people through their supine negligence not much op∣posing of them. Yet that the people might be husht into quiet (with much grace) they grant them the favor of beggars, viz. <HI>Postulare</HI>; to ask for an officer. But this plundering of the churches falls within the second grand division of time. Not within the first three hundred years.</P>
<P N="3">3. Of approbating of ordination. All the people were consulted; and none were admitted into holy orders with∣out their approbation. As we are assured by <HI>Cyprian (Epist.</HI> 33.) who tells us it was his constant custom, in all ordinations to consult his people, and with their common counsel to weigh the merit of every candidate of the sacred orders.</P>
<P N="4">4. Of deposing of their own officers the way. <HI>Pag.</HI> 96. <HI>Sect.</HI> 2. For if their bishops proved scandalous and wicked in life; heretical and apostates from the faith, the churches had power to degrade and depose them, and choose others in their room. There is a peculiar example of this kind in a letter from the church of <HI>Rome</HI> to the church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> written by <HI>Clemens Romanus, Euseb. Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>Cap.</HI> 14. upon which Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> makes this observation, <HI>viz.</HI> That
<PB N="14" REF="012626_0013_0F8B8F0E48DBDA50"/>
the church of <HI>Corinth</HI> was fallen into a sinful excess in the deposition of their elders, whom the church of <HI>Rome</HI> judged to have presided amongst th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s laudably. But yet in the whole epistle the church of <HI>Corinth</HI> is no where reproved, for assuming an authority to themselves which did not be∣long to them. It seems what <HI>Cyprian</HI> afterwards affirmed, was then acknowledged, namely, that the right of choosing the worthy, and rejecting the unworthy was in the body of the people.

Also when two <HI>Spanish</HI> bishops were de∣posed by their churches, that the said churches might not seem to act by a power which belonged not to them; they sent into <HI>Africa</HI> to several bishops to know their judgment thereupon, who being convened in a synod (<HI>Anno.

And many other passages there are in that epis∣tle which flatly assert the peoples power of deposing scan∣dalous bishops.

<P N="3">3. WE come nextly to consider the joint acts of officers and people, carrying on, as an organic body. And these peculiarly refer to the dis∣cipline, and good government of the church. And tho' ministerial trust (precisely considered) was solely devolved on the officers; yet still the fraternity stood interested in, and possessed of a share in the juridical part of govern∣ment, the whole church in ordinary cases were the judges which composed the ecclesiastical consistory. So that the power of the keys was so lodged both in the bos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ops and people, as that each had a share to exercise and improve in joint acts of judicature, and thus the clergy and laity conjunctly made up that supreme court which was in every parish, where all church offenders were tried, and when found guilty, were sentenced and condemned. That the laity did exercise judicial power in the church, is further evident from several testimonies. As in that of <HI>Clemens Romanus. (Epist.</HI> 1. <HI>Ad Corinth,</HI> p. 69.) where he writes: <HI>Who will say according to the example of</HI> Moses, <HI>If seditions, contentions, and schisms are happened because of me, I will depart, I will go whithersoever you please, and I will do what shall be injoyned me by the people, so the church of Christ be in peace.</HI> So <HI>Origen</HI> discribes a criminal ap∣pearing be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re the whole church. In <HI>Mat. Tom.</HI> 13. <HI>Cyprian,</HI> when some had committed some great misde∣meanors, professes himself not a sufficient judge, but they ought to be tryed by all the people, <HI>Epist.</HI> 28. <HI>p.</HI> 64. And to the same purpose, he writes of other delinquents; viz. That such matters should be adjusted according to the ar∣bitrament, and common council of the people. And that the lapsed in admitting them to communion, should plead their cause before the clergy, and before all the people. And concerning such matters he writes to the people, that when it should please God to restore peace to the church, and reduce him from exile, then the case of the delinquents should be examined in their presence, and according to their judgment. And <HI>Cyprian</HI> writes in another place, that all things were debated in common amongst them. And that whoever was excommunicated it was by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suf∣frages of the people. And though the elders were princi∣pally

concerned, in preparing cases for the churches cog∣nizance; yet its plain that the decisive suffrage was (in part) the prerogative of the people. To this purpose we have an instance in some that joined in the schism of <HI>Novatus</HI>; who being sensible of their fault, came into the presbytery, and desired the churches peace; the presbytery accepted their submission, and proposed it to the whole church, who readily embraced it. Now it is to be ob∣served, that agreably with the fore-cited practice of the primitive churches, our own platform has decided the question concerning the subject, and exercise of govern∣ment, <HI>Platf. C.</HI> 10. <HI>Sect.</HI> 11. The ordinary power of government belongs only to the elders; and power of pri∣vilege remaineth with the brother-hood, (as the power of judgment in matters of censure, and and power of liberty in matters of liberty) thence it follows, that in an organic church, and right administration, all church acts proceed after the manner of a mixt administration, so that no church act can be consummated, or perfected without the consent of both.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P N="4">4. I Shall nextly consider the fellowship and commu∣nion that distinct churches had and held one with another.</P>
<P>It is very obvious by this time, (and he must blind his own eyes that won't see it) that the primitive churches according to the account we have of their regiment for the first three hundred years from Christ) were distinct, poli∣tical bodies; and neither diocaesan, national, provincial nor classical, but properly congregational churches. And as such, were perfect and compleat societies incorporate; so that they had a power, and capacity of carrying on all church work within themselves, and wanted not to borrow, or receive from others, for the support of their being, and so were independent. Yet considering they were imperfect in their matter, and therefore to help forward their well-being, wanted the advantage of all good means; with the influence of the grace, love, knowledge, experience, wis∣dom, and counsel of each other; so they were dependent, and became mutually officious, and accountable each to other: somewhat after the manner, as Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> dis∣tinguishes
<PB N="17" REF="012626_0016_0F8B8F120CA24890" MS="y"/>
on the independency, and dependency of gos∣pel churches. <HI>Pol. lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. Says he, <HI>indepen∣dency implies two things.</HI> Either,</P>
<P N="1">1. An absolute supremacy, opposed to subordination; and so a particular church is not independent, it being ac∣countable to civil government, &amp;c. And also to the conso∣ciation of churches. Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. Independency signifies a sufficieny in its kind, for the attainment of its end. And in this sense, independency is opposed to imperfection: And if we take it thus, then a particular church may be said to be independent, it be∣ing sufficient to attain the end it was instituted for; it having compleat power, when rightly constituted, to ex∣ercise all the ordinances of God. And thus we find that the primitive churches in this sense were independent churches: that is, every particular church had a sufficient right, and power, without the concurrence and authority of any other church, to carry on the worship of God, and exercise of discipline in their distinct society. And yet as they were parts of the universal church, held themselves obliged to a suitable communion. And for the support of unity, love, and concord amongst them, and to advise about their common circumstances and condition; and also to regulate their ecclesiastical affairs within their general limits, for their mutual advantage; did therefore form them∣selves into synodical assemblies, &amp; and were governed in com∣mon by them; for their synodical decrees, canons or instituti∣ons, were accounted abligatory to all the churches, who had their representatives in the synods. For indeed to what pur∣pose else did they draw up their resolves, but for the good and benefit of the whole community. And it would have been very fruitless to have made wearisome journeys, with great cost and pains to determine such things, as they judged ex∣pedient for the churches well-being; if after all, it were indifferent whether they were obeyed or no: or that when the whole was agreed, some should reluct, and remonstrate; and especially when things were fairly settled by a joint suffrage in synods, some small set of wise men should hold themselves wiser than whole synods; and afterward should of their own heads in their more private apartments set forward new schemes, which in itself is disorderly, and a way to keep the churches constantly fluctuating and wrest∣less
<PB N="18" REF="012626_0017_0F8B8F12C53B7A40"/>
like the unstable ocean. And indeed, considering the regularity, wisdom and union in synodical settlements, whilst that all sorts of persons interested, both officers and people having had their full liberty in debates, and their free votes and suffrages, in drawing up the decrees and set∣tlements; it is a bold intrusion, and little better than defy∣ing and trampling under foot the unity, love, honor an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> authority of the churches, to run counter with synodical settlements, till they are fairly repealed by the like power which made the settlements. And thus we come to con∣sider the members of the synods of the primitive churches.</P>
<P>And these were bishops, presbyters, deacons, and de∣puted lay-men, in behalf of the people of their respective churches. At a great synod at <HI>Antioch,</HI> which condemned <HI>Paulus Samosatenus,</HI> there were present bishops, presbyters, deacons, and the church of God; that is lay-men, who represented the people of their several churches. <HI>Euseb. l.</HI> 7. <HI>cap.</HI> 30. Also when the heresie of the <HI>Montanists</HI> was fixed and preached, the faithful in <HI>Asia</HI> met together se∣veral times to examine it, and upon examination condemn∣ed it. <HI>Euseb. lib.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 16. Also there being some heats in the church of <HI>Carthage,</HI> about the restitution of the lapsed, <HI>Cyprian,</HI> bishop of that church, writes from exile,—That there should be convened a synod of bishops, and of the laity, who had stood firm through the persecu∣tion, to consult about, and determine their affairs. <HI>Epist.</HI> 14. And moreover at a great synod held at <HI>Carthage, Anno</HI> 258, there were present eighty-seven bishops, together with presbyters and deacons, and a great part of the laity. <HI>Apud Cypri. p.</HI> 443.</P>
<P>The principles of the churches in <HI>New-England,</HI> assert∣ing the right of the people in synodical meetings, is fully set down in the chapter concerning synods. <HI>Platf.</HI> And the practice of these in harmony with the primitive churches has been all along agreable to it. In the last sy∣nod which was in <HI>New-England,</HI> in the year 1679, some churches sent only their elders without their brethren, with which the synod was so far unsatisfied, as that they would not allow those pastors to sit with them, until they had pre∣vailed with their churches to send brethren also; being very tender of admiting any thing, that should look like the infringement of that liberty and priviledge, which does

by the institution of Christ belong to the brotherhood in particular churches. Dr. <HI>Mather's Order. Q.</HI> 11. I shall conclude this head or demonstration with these weigh∣ty and solemn words of the learned and famous Mr. <HI>Oakes,</HI> praesident of the college, in his election sermon. Consider (says he) what will be the end of receeding, or making of a defection from the way of church government established amongst us. I profess that I look upon the discovery and settlement of the congregational way, as the boon, the gratuity, the largeness of divine bounty, which the Lord graciously bestowed on this people, that followed him into this wilderness, and who were seperated from their bre∣thren. Those good people who came over had more love, zeal, and affectionate desire of communion with God, in pure worship and ordinances, and did more in order to it, than others; and the Lord did more for them than for any people in the world, in shewing them the pattern of his house, and the truer scriptural-way of church govern∣ment and administrations. God was certainly in a more than ordinary way present with his servants, in laying of our foundations; and in settling church-order, according to the will and appointment of Christ. Consider what will be the sad issue of revolting from the way fixed on to one extreme or to another, whether it be to presbyteri∣anism or brownism. 'As for the presbyterians, it must be acknowledged, that there are amongst them, as pious, learned, sober, orthodox men, as the world affords; and that there is as much of the power of godliness among that party, and of the spirit of the good old puritans, as among any people in the world. And as for the ways of their church government, it must be confessed, that in the day of it, it was a great step to reformation. The refor∣mation in king <HI>Edward</HI>'s days, was a blessed work, and the reformation of <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> was then a larger step, and in many respects purer than the other. And for my part, I fully believe that the congregational-way far exceeds both, and is the highest step that has been taken towards reformation; and for the substance of it, it is the very same way that was established and practised in the primitive times, according to the institution of Jesus Christ.' Thus ends my first demonstration in a fair paral∣lel drawn up between the holiest churches that ever were in
<PB N="20" REF="012626_0019_0F8B8F179C266008"/>
the world, and the churches of <HI>New-England</HI>; and however they may differ in their morals, they are very harmonious in their order. And considering that the former cannot rationally be thought but they derived their constitution from the apostles, and so it must needs be of a divine ori∣ginal: and if so then these in <HI>New-England</HI> who are fashioned so exactly like them, must needs be of the same pedigree, &amp;c. But I shall wave all improvement of the premises, and leave the whole to the serious and judicious thoughts of every impartial reader, not doubting but he will find sufficient evidence of the divine original of these churches in what has been said. And that I might now obtain a <HI>supersedeas,</HI> and forbear adding any further plea in their defence. But yet to gratify my own curiosity, and divert the reader, I shall proceed to inquire in to the natural reason of the constitution of those churches we have been comparing. In this question I shall go out of the common road, and take into an unusual and unbeaten path; where∣in possibly I may fall into some thickets now and then, and be somewhat entangled; yet I hope the candid reader will afford some succour by his tender clemency, and his friendly interpretation of my good intentions. For tho' I may in so devious a way, miss of some part of the truth▪ yet I have a great presumption that I may open a road to men of greater learning, and a deeper search, that will lead to a rich treasure of knowledge, and wisdom, for ease and re∣lief under those many questions and crabbed debates con∣cerning church-government in the christian world; for to me it seems most apparent, that under Christ the reason of the constitution of these and the primitive churches, is really and truly owing to the original state and liberty of mankind, and founded puculiarly in the light of nature. And thus I come to the</P>

<P>THE divine establishment in providence of the fore∣named churches, in their order is apparently the royal assent of the supreme monarch of the churches, to the grave decisions of reason in favour of mans natural

state of being, and original freedom. For if we should make a new <HI>survey</HI> of the constitution before named under the brightest light of nature, there is no greater example of natural wisdom in any settlement on earth; for the present and future security of human beings in all that is most valuable and grand, than in this. That it seems to me as though wise and provident nature by the dictates of right reason, excited by the moving suggestions of humanity; and awed with the just demands of natural liberty, equity, equal∣ity, &amp; principles of self-preservation originally drew up the scheme, and then obtained the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l approbation. And certainly it is agreable that we attri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te it to God whether we receive it nextly from reason or revelation, for that each is equally an emanation of his wisdom, <HI>Prov.</HI> 20.27.

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I Shall disclose several principles of natural know∣ledge; plainly discovering the law of nature; or the true sentiments of natural reason, with respect to mans being and government. And in this essay I shall peculiarly confine the discourse to two heads, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Of the natural (in distinction to the civil) and then,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Of the civil being of man. And I shall principally take baron <HI>Puffendorff</HI> for my chief guide and spokes-man.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. I shall consider man in a state of natural being, as a free-born subject under the crown of heaven, and owing homage to none but God himself. It is certain civil go∣vernment in general, is a very admirable result of provi∣dence, and an incomparable benefit to mankind, yet must needs be acknowledged to be the effect of human free-com∣pacts and not of divine institution; it is the produce of mans reason, of human and rational combinations, and not from any direct orders of infinite wisdom, in any posi∣tive law wherein is drawn up this or that scheme of civil government. Government (says the Lord <HI>Warrington</HI>) is necessary—in that no society of men can subsist without it; and that particular form of government is necessary which best suits the temper and inclination of a people. No∣thing can be God's ordinance, but what he has particularly declared to be such; there is no particular form of civil government described in God's word, neither does nature prompt it. The government of the Jews was changed five times. Government is not formed by nature, as other births or productions; if it were, it would be the same in all countries; because nature keeps the same method, in the same thing, in all climates. If a common-wealth be changed into a monarchy, is it nature that forms, and brings forth the monarch? Or if a royal family be wholly extinct (as in <HI>Noah</HI>'s case, being not heir apparent from descent from Adam) is it nature that must go to work (with the kings bees, who themselves alone preserve the royal race in that empire) to breed a monarch before the people can have a king, or a government sent over them? And thus we must leave kings to resolve which is their best title to their crowns, whether natural right, or the constitution of government settled by human compacts,
<PB N="23" REF="012626_0022_0F8B8F1A2FA60F20"/>
under the direction and conduct of reason. But to pro∣ceed under the head of a state of natural being, I shall more distinctly explain the state of human nature in its original capacity, as man is placed on earth by his maker, and cloathed with many investitures, and immunities which properly belong to man separately considered. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. The prime immunity in mans state, is that he is most properly the subject of the law of nature. He is the fa∣vorite animal on earth; in that this part of God's image, <HI>viz.</HI> reason is congenate with his nature, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in by a law immutable, instampt upon his frame, God has provided a rule for men in all their actions, obliging each one to the performance of that which is right, not only as to justice, but likewise as to all other moral virtues, the which is no∣thing but the dictate of right reason founded in the soul of man. <HI>Molloy, De Mao, Praef.</HI> That which is to be drawn from mans reason, flowing from the true current of that faculty, when unperverted, may be said to be the law of nature, on which account, the holy scriptures declare it written on mens hearts. For being endowed with a soul, you may know from yourself, how and what you ought to act. Rom. 2.14. <HI>These having not a law, are a law to themselves.</HI> So that the meaning is, when we ac∣knowledge the law of nature to be the dictate of right reason, we must mean that the understanding of man is en∣dowed with such a power, as to be able, from the con∣templation of human condition to discover a necessity of living agreably with this law: And likewise to find out some principle, by which the precepts of it, may be clear∣ly and solidly demonstrated. The way to discover the law of nature in our own state, is by a narrow watch, and ac∣curate contemplation of our natural condition, and propen∣sions. Others say this is the way to find out the law of nature. <HI>scil.</HI> If a man any ways doubts, whether what he is going to do to another man be agreable to the law of nature, then let him suppose himself to be in that other mans room; and by this rule effectually executed, a man must be a very dull scholar to nature not to make pro∣ficiency in the knowledge of her laws. But more particu∣larly in pursuing our condition for the discovery of the law of nature, this is very obvious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> view▪ <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="24" REF="012626_0023_0F8B8F1A5CF596E8"/>1. A principle of self love, and self preservation, is very predominant in every mans being.</P>
<P N="2">2. A sociable disposition.</P>
<P N="3">3. An affection or love to mankind in general. And to give such sentiments the force of a law, we must suppose a God who takes care of all mankind, and has thus obliged each one, as a subject of higher principles of being, than meer instincts. For that all law properly considered, sup∣poses a capable subject, and a superiour power, and the law of God which is binding, is published by the dictates of right re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as other ways: Therefore says <HI>Plutarch,</HI> to follow God and obey reason is the same thing. But moreover that God has established the law of nature, as the general rule of government, is further illustrable from the man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sanctions in providence, and from the peace and guilt of conscience in them that either obey, or violate the law of nature. But moreover, the foundation of the law of nature with relation to government, may be thus discovered. <HI>scil.</HI> Man is a creature extreamly desirous of his own preservation; of himself he is plainly exposed to many wants, unable to secure his own safety and mainte∣nance, without the assistance of his fellows; &amp; he is also able of returning kindness by the furtherance of mutual good; but yet man is often found to be malicious, insolent, and easily provoked, and as powerful in effecting mischief, as he is ready in designing it. Now that such a creature may be preserved, it is necessary that he be sociable; that is, that he be capable and disposed to unite himself to those of his own species, and to regulate himself towards them, that they may have no fair reason to do him harm; but rather incline to promote his interests, and secure his rights and concerns. This then is a fundamental law of nature, that every man as far as in him lies, do maintain a sociableness with others, agreable with the main end and disposition of human nature in general. For this is very apparent, that reason and society render man the most potent of all crea∣tures. And finally, from the principles of sociableness it follows as a fundamental law of nature, that man is not so wedded to his own interest, but that he can make the com∣mon good the mark of his aim: and hence he becomes capacitated to enter into a civil state by the law of nature; for without this property in nature, viz. Sociableness,
<PB N="25" REF="012626_0024_0F8B8F1B0B3F3DF0"/>
which is for cementing of parts, every government would soon moulder and dissolve.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second great immunity of man is an original liberty instampt upon his rational nature. He that intrudes upon this liberty, violates the law of nature. In this dis∣course I shall wave the consideration of mans moral turpi∣tude, but shall view him physically as a creature which God has made and furnished essentially with many enobl∣ing immunities, which render him the most august animal in the world, and still, whatever has happened since his creation, he remains at the upper-end of nature, and as such is a creature of a very noble character. For as to his dominion, the whole frame of the lower part of the uni∣verse is devoted to his use, and at his command, and his liberty under the conduct of right reason, is equal with his trust. Which liberty may be briefly considered, in∣ternally as to his mind, and externally as to his person.</P>
<P N="1">1. The native internal liberty of man's nature implies, a faculty of doing or omitting things according to the direc∣tion of his judgment. But in a more special meaning, this liberty does not consist in a loose and ungovernable free∣dom, or in an unbounded licence of acting. Such licence is disagreeing with the condition and dignity of man, and would make man of a lower and meaner constitution than brute creatures; who in all their liberties are kept under a better and a more rational government, by their instincts. Therefore as <HI>Plutarch</HI> says, Those persons only who live in obedience to reason, are worthy to be accounted free: They alone live as they will, who have learnt what they ought to will. So that the true natural liberty of man, such as really and truely agrees to him, must be understood, as he is guided and restrained by the tyes of reason, and laws of nature; all the rest is brutal, if not worse.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mans external personal, natural liberty, antecedent to all human parts, or alliances must also be considered. And so every man must be conceived to be perfectly in his own power and disposal, and not ro be controuled by the authority of any other. And thus every man, must be acknowledged equal to every man, since all subjection and all command are equally banished on both sides; and con∣sidering all men thus at liberty, every m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, has a prero∣gative
<PB N="26" REF="012626_0025_0F8B8F1ECB49F808"/>
to judge for himself, viz. What shall be most for his behoof, happiness and well-being.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third capital immunity belonging to mans na∣ture, is an equality amongst men; which is not to be de∣nied by the law of nature, till man has resigned himself with all his rights for the sake of a civil state; and then his personal liberty and equality is to be cherished, and preserved to the highest degree, as will consist with all just distinctions amongst men of honor, and shall be agrea∣ble with the public good. For man has a high valuation of himself, and the passion seems to lay its first foundation (not in pride, but) really in the high and admirable frame and constitution of human nature. The word man says my author, is thought to carry somewhat of dignity in its sound; and we commonly make use of this as the most proper and prevailing arguments against a rude insulter, <HI>viz. I am not a beast or a dog: But am a man as well as yourself.</HI> Since then human nature agrees equally with all persons; and since no one can live a sociable life with another that does not own or respect him as a man; it follows as a command of the law of nature, that every man esteem and treat another as one who is naturally his equal, or who is a man as well as he. There be many popular, or plausible reasons that greatly illustrate this equality, viz. that we all derive our being from one stock, the same common father of human race. On this consider∣ation <HI>Boethius</HI> che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks the pride of the insulting nobility.</P>

we all owe our existence to the same method of propaga∣tion. The noblest mortal in his entrance on the stage of life, is not distinguished by any pomp or of passage from the lowest of mankind; and our life hastens to the same general mark: Death observes no ceremony, but knocks as loud at the barriers of the court, as at the door of the cottage. This equality being admitted, bears a very great force in maintaining peace and friendship amongst men. For that he who would use the assistance of others, in pro∣moting his own advantage, ought as freely to be at their service when they want his help on the like occasions. One good turn requires another, is the common proverb; for otherwise he must need esteem others unequal to himself, who constantly demands their aid, and as constantly denies his own. And whoever is of this insolent temper, cannot but highly displease those about him, and soon give occa∣sion of the breach of the common peace. It was a man∣ly reproof which <HI>Charactacus</HI> gave the <HI>Romans. Num Si vos Omnibus,</HI> &amp;c. What! because you desire to be masters of all men, does it follow therefore that all men should desire to be your slaves, for that it is a command of na∣tures law, that no man that has not obtained a particular and special right, shall arrogate to himself a larger share than his fellows, but shall admit others to equal privileges with himself. So that the principle of equality in a na∣tural state, is peculiarly transgressed by pride, which is when a man without sufficient reason, prefers, himself to others. And though as <HI>Hensius,</HI> paraphrases upon <HI>Aristotle's</HI> politicks to this purpose. viz. Nothing is more suitable to nature, than that those who excel in understanding and prudence, should rule and controul those who are less hap∣py in those advantages, &amp;c. Yet we must note, that there is room for an answer, <HI>scil.</HI> That it would be the greatest absurdity to believe, that nature actually invests the wise with a sovereignity over the weak; or with a right of forcing them against their wills; for that no sovereignity can be established, unless some human deed, or cove∣nant precede: Nor does natural fitness for govern∣ment make a man presently governor over another; for that as <HI>Ulpian</HI> says, <HI>by a natural right all men are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> free;</HI> and nature having set all men upon a level and made them equals, no servitude or subjection can be conceived
<PB N="28" REF="012626_0027_0F8B8F22148C8F20"/>
without inequality; and this cannot be made without usur∣pation or force in others, or voluntary compliance in those who resign their freedom, and give away their degree of natural being. And thus we come,</P>
<P N="2">2. To consider man in a civil state of being; wherein we shall observe the great difference between a natural, and political state; for in the latter state many great dispropor∣tions appear, or at least many obvious distinctions are soon made amongst men; which doctrine is to be laid open un∣der a few heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. Every man considered in a natural state, must be al∣lowed to be free, and at his own dispose; yet to suit mans inclinations to society; and in a peculiar manner to gratify the necessity he is in of public rule and order, he is impel∣led to enter into a civil community; and divests himself of his natural freedom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd puts himself under government; which amongst other th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gs comprehends the power of life and death over him, together with authority to enjoin him some things to which he has an utter aversion, and to pro∣hibit him other things, for which he may have as strong an inclination; so that he may be often under this authori∣ty, obliged to sacrifice his private, for the public good. So that though man is inclined to society, yet he is driven to a combination by great necessity. For that the true and leading cause of forming governments, and yielding up natural liberty, and throwing mans equality into a com∣mon pile to be new cast by the rules of fellowship; was really and truly to guard themselves against the injuries men were liable to interchangeably; for none so good to man, as man, and yet none a greater enemy. So that,</P>
<P N="2">2. The first human subject and original of civil power is the people. For as they have a power every man over himself in a natural state, so upon a combination they can and do bequeath this power unto others; and settle it according as their united discretion shall determine. For that this is very plain that when the subject of sovereign power is quite extinct, that power returns to the people again. And when they are free, they may set up what species of government they please; or if they rather incline to it, they may subside into a state of natural be∣ing, if it be plainly for the best. In the Eastern country of the <HI>Magul,</HI> we have some resemblance of the case; for
<PB N="29" REF="012626_0028_0F8B8F22911D4578"/>
upon the death of an absolute monarch, they live so many days without a civil head; but in that <HI>Interregnum,</HI> those who survive the vacancy, are glad to get into a civil state again; and usually they are in a very bloody condition when they return under the covert of a new monarch; this project is to indear the people to a tyranny, from the experience they have so lately had of an anarchy.</P>
<P N="3">3. The formal reason of government is the will of a community, yielded up and surrendered to some other subject, either of one particular person, or more, conveyed in the following manner.</P>
<P>Let us conceive in our mind a multitude of men, all na∣turally free and equal; going about voluntarily, to erect themselves into a new common-wealth. Now their con∣dition being such, to bring themselves into a politick body, they must needs enter into divers covenants.</P>
<P N="1">1. They must interchangeably each man covenant to join in one lasting society, that they may be capable to concert the measures of their safety, by a public vote.</P>
<P N="2">2. A vote or decree must then nextly pass to set up some particular species of government over them. And if they are joined in their first compact upon absolute terms to stand to the decision of the first vote concerning the species of government: Then all are bound by the majority to acquiesce in that particular form thereby settled, though their own private opinion, incline them to some other model.</P>
<P N="3">3. After a decree has specified the particular form of government, then there will be need of a new covenant, whereby those on whom sovereignity is conferred, engage to take care of the common peace, and welfare. And the subjects on the other hand, to yield them faithful obedi∣ence. In which covenant is included that submission and union of wills, by which a state may be conceived to be but one person. So that the most proper definition of a civil state, is this, viz. A civil state is a compound moral person. Whose will (united by those covenants before passed) is the will of all; to the end it may use, and ap∣ply the strength and riches of private persons towards maintaining the common pence, security, and well-being of all, which may be conceived as tho' the whole state was now become but one man; in which the aforesaid cove∣nants may be suppos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d under God's providence, to be the
<PB N="30" REF="012626_0029_0F8B8F23456C61C8"/>
divine <HI>Fiat,</HI> pronounced by God, let us make man. And by way of resemblance the aforesaid being may be thus anatomized.</P>
<P N="1">1. The sovereign power is the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> infused, giving life and motion to the whole body.</P>
<P N="2">2. Subordinate officers are the joints by which the body moves.</P>
<P N="3">3. Wealth and riches are the strength.</P>
<P N="4">4. Equity and laws are the reason.</P>
<P N="5">5. Councellors the memory.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Salus P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>puli,</HI> or the happiness of the people, is the end of its being; or main business to be attended and done.</P>
<P N="7">7. Concord amongst the members, and all estates, is the health.</P>
<P N="8">8. Sedition is sickness, and civil war death.</P>
<P N="4">4. The parts of sovereignity may be considered: So,</P>
<P N="1">1. As it prescribes the rule of action: It is rightly ter∣med legislative power.</P>
<P N="2">2. As it determines the controversies of subjects by the standard of those rules. So is it justly termed judiciary power.</P>
<P N="3">3. As it arms the subjects against foreigners, or forbids hostility, so its called the power of peace and war.</P>
<P N="4">4. As it takes in ministers for the discharge of business, so it is called the right of appointing magistrates. So that all great officers and public servants, must needs owe their original to the creating power of sovereignty. So that those whose right it is to create, may dissolve the being of those who are created, unless they cast them into an im∣mortal frame. And yet must needs be dissoluble if they justly forfeit their being to their creators.</P>
<P N="5">5. The chief end of civil communities, is that men thus conjoined, may be secured against the injuries, they are liable to from their own kind. For if every man could secure himself singly; it would be great folly for him, to renounce his natural liberty, in which every man is his own king and protector.</P>
<P N="6">6. The sovereign authority besides, that it inheres in every state as in a common and general subject. So far∣ther according as it resides in some one person, or in a council (consisting of some select persons, or of all
<PB N="31" REF="012626_0030_0F8B8F249F247150"/>
the members of a community) as in a proper and particu∣lar subject, so it produceth different forms of common∣wealths, viz. Such as are either simple and regular, or mixt.</P>
<P N="1">1. The forms of a regular state are three only, which forms arise from the proper and particular subject, in which the supream power resides. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. A democracy; which is when the sovereign power is lodged in a council consisting of all the members, and where every member has the privilege of a vote. This form of government, appears in the greatest part of the world to have been the most ancient. For that reason seems to shew it to be most probable, That when men (being originally in a condition of natural freedom and equality) had thoughts of joining in a civil body, would without question be inclined to administer their common affairs, by their common judgment, and so must necessarily to gratify that inclination establish a democracy; neither can it be rationally imagined, that fathers of families be∣ing yet free and independent, should in a moment, or little time take of their long delight in governing their own affairs, and devolve all upon some single sovereign com∣mander; for that it seems to have been thought more equitable, that what belonged to all should be managed by all, when all had entered by compact into one com∣munity. The original of our government, says <HI>Plato,</HI> (speaking of the <HI>Athenian</HI> common-wealth) was taken from the equality of our race. Other states there are composed of different blood, and of unequal lines, the consequence of which are disproportionable sovereignity, tyranical or oligarchycal sway; under which men live in such a man∣ner, as to esteem themselves partly lords, and partly slaves to each other. But we and our countrymen, being all born brethren of the same mother, do not look upon our∣selves to stand under so hard a relation, as that of lords and slaves; but the parity of our descent incline us to keep up the like parity by our laws, and to yield the precedency to nothing but to superior virtue and wisdom. And more∣over it seems to very manifest that most civil communities arose at first from the union of families, that were nearly allied in race and blood. And though ancient story make frequent mention of kings, yet it appears that most of
<PB N="32" REF="012626_0031_0F8B8F24CB6DF2F8"/>
them were such that had an influence rather in perswading, than in any power of commanding. So <HI>Justin</HI> discribes that kind of government, as the most primitive, which <HI>Aristotle</HI> stiles an heroical kingdom. <HI>viz.</HI> Such as is no ways inconsistent with a democratical state. <HI>De princip. Reru.</HI> 1. <HI>L.</HI> 1. <HI>C.</HI></P>
<P>A democracy is then erected, when a number of free persons, do assemble together, in order to enter into a co∣venant for uniting themselves in a body: And such a preparative assembly hath some appearance already of a democracy; it is a democracy in <HI>embrio,</HI> properly in this respect, that every man hath the priviledge freely to deli∣ver his opinion concerning the common affairs. Yet he who dissents from the vote of the majority, is not in the least obliged by what they determine, till by a second covenant, a popular form be actually established; for not before then can we call it a democratical government, <HI>viz.</HI> Till the right of determining all matters relating to the public safety, is actually placed in a general assembly of the whole people; or by their own compact and mutu∣al agreement, determine themselves the proper subjects for the exercise of sovereign power. And to compleat this state, and render it capable to exert its power to answer the end of a civil state: These conditions are necessary.</P>
<P N="1">1. That a certain time and place be assigned for assem∣bling.</P>
<P N="2">2. That when the assembly be orderly met, as to time and place, that then the vote of the majority must pass for the vote of the whole body.</P>
<P N="3">3. That magistrates be appointed to exercise the autho∣rity of the whole for the better dispatch of business, of every days occurrence; who also may with more mature diligence, search into more important affairs; and if in case any thing happens of greater consequence, may re∣port it to the assembly; and be peculiarly serviceable in putting all public decrees into execution. Because a large body of people is almost useless in respect of the last ser∣vice, and of many others as to the more particular appli∣cation and exercise of power. Therefore it is most agrea∣ble with the law of nature, that they institute their officers to act in their name, and stead.</P>
<P N="2">2. The second species of regular government, is an aris∣tocracy;
<PB N="33" REF="012626_0032_0F8B8F25832636A0"/>
and this is said then to be constituted when the people, or assembly united by a first covenant, and having thereby cast themselves into the first rudiments of a state; do then by common decree, devolve the sovereign power, on a council consisting of some select members; and these having accepted of the designation, are then properly in∣vested with sovereign command; and then an aristocracy is formed.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third species of a regular government, is a monarchy, which is settled when the sovereign power is conferred on some one worthy person. It differs from the former, because a monarch who is but one person in natu∣ral, as well as in moral account, and so is furnished with an immediate power of exercising sovereign command in all instances of government; but the forenamed must needs have particular time and place assigned; but the power and authority is equal in each.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mixt governments, which are various and of divers kinds (not now to be enumerated) yet possibly the fairest in the world is that which has a regular monarchy; settled upon a noble democracy as its basis. And each part of the government is so adjusted by pacts and laws that renders the whole constitution an <HI>elisium.</HI> It is said of the British empire, that it is such a monarchy, as that by the neces∣sary subordinate concurrence of the lords and commons, in the making and repealing all statutes or acts of parliament; it hath the main advantages of an aristocracy, and of a democracy, and yet free from the disadvantages and evils of either. It is such a monarchy, as by most admirable temperament affords very much to the industry, liberty, and happiness of the subject, and reserves enough for the majesty and prerogative of any king, who will own his people as subjects, not as slaves, It is a kingdom, that of all the kingdoms of the world, is most like to the kingdom of Jesus Christ, whose yoke is easy, and burden light. Present state of England 1st part, 64 <HI>p.</HI> Thus having drawn up this brief scheme concerning man, and the nature of civil government, he is become sole subject of, I shall nextly proceed to make improvements of the premises, to accommodate the main subject under our consideration.</P>
<P N="2">2. I shall now make some improvement of the forego∣ing
<PB N="34" REF="012626_0033_0F8B8F2BB4951328"/>
principles of civil knowledge, fairly deduced from the law of nature. And I shall peculiarly refer to ecclesiasti∣cal affairs, whereby we may in probability discover more clearly the kind, and something of the nature of that go∣vernment, which Christ has placed in and over his church. The learned debates of men, and divine writ sometimes seems to cast such a grandeur on the church and its officers, as though they stood in peerage with civil empire. Rev. 1.6, 9. 1 Pet. 2.9. 1 Cor. 4.8. 1 Cor. 12.28. 2 Cor. 10.8. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t all such expressions must needs be other∣ways interpreted. God is the highest cause that acts by council; and it must needs be altogether repugnant, to think he should fore-cast the state of this world by no bet∣ter a scheme, than to order two sovereign powers, in the same grand community, which would be like placing two suns in the firmament, which would be to set the universe into a flame : That should such an error happen, one must needs be forthwith extinguished, to bring the frame of nature into a just temper and keep it out of harms way. But to proceed with my purpose I shall go back upon the civil scheme, and inquire after two things: First of rebel∣lion against government in general, and then in special; whether any of the aforesaid species of regular govern∣ment can be predictable of the church of God on earth.</P>
<P N="1">1. In general, concerning rebellion against government, for particular subjects to break in upon regular communites duly established, is from the premises to violate the law of nature; and is a high usurpation upon the first grand im∣munities of mankind. Such rebels in states, and usurpers in churches affront the world, with a presumption that the best of the brotherhood are a company of fools, and that themselves have fairly monopolized all the reason of hu∣man nature. Yea, they take upon them the boldness to assume a prerogative of trampling under foot the natural original equality and liberty of their fellows; for to push the proprietors of settlements out of possession of their old, and impose new schemes upon them, is vertually to declare them in a state of vassalage, or that they were born so; and therefore will the usurper be so gracious as to insure them they shall not be sold at the next market: they must esteem it a favor, for by this time all the original prerogatives of mans nature are intentionally a victim,
<PB N="35" REF="012626_0034_0F8B8F2C88A48E10"/>
smoaking to satiate the usurpers ambition. It is a very tart observation on an English monarch, and where it may by proportion be applied to a subject must needs sink very deep, and serve for evidence under this head. It is in the secret history of K. <HI>C.</HI> 2. and K. <HI>J.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 2. says my author, Where the constitution of a nation is such, that the laws of the land are the measures both of the sovereigns commands, and the obedience of the subjects, whereby it is provided; that as the one are not to invade what by concessions and stipulations is granted to the ruler; so the other is not to deprive them of their lawful and de∣termined rights and liberties; then the prince who strives to subvert the fundamental laws of the society, is the trai∣tor and the rebel, and not the people, who endeavor to preserve and defend their own. It's very applicable to particular men in their rebellions or usurpations in church or state.</P>
<P N="2">2. In special I shall now proceed to enquire, whether any of the aforesaid species of regular, unmixt governments, can with any good shew of reason be predictable of the church of Christ on earth. If the churches of Christ, as churches, are either the object or subject of a sovereign power intrusted in the hands of men, then most certainly one of the fore-cited schemes of a perfect government will be applicable to it.</P>
<P>Before I pursue the enquiry, it may not be improper to pause, and make some caution here, by distinguishing between that which may have some resemblance of civil power, and the thing itself; and so the power of churches is but a faint resemblance of civil power; it comes in re∣ality nothing near to the thing itself; for the one is truly coercive, the other persuasive; the one is sovereign power, the other is delegated and ministerial: but not to delay, I shall proceed with my enquiry, and therein shall endeavor to humor the several great claimers of government in the church of Christ. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. I shall begin with a monarchy. It's certain, his holiness, either by reasonable pleas, or powerful cheats, has assumed an absolute and universal sovereignity; this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ills his cathedral chair, and is adorned with a triple crown, and in defence thereof does protest, The Almighty has made him both key-keeper of heaven and hell, with
<PB N="36" REF="012626_0035_0F8B8F2D06066390"/>
the adjacent territories of purgatory, and vested in him an absolute sovereignity over the christian world. And his right has so far prevailed, that princes and civil monarchs hold their crowns and donations as his dutiful sons, and loyal subjects, he therefore decks himself with the spoils of the divine attributes, stiling himself, our Lord God, <HI>optimum, maximum et supremum numen in Terris</HI>; a God on earth, a visible deity, and that his power is absolute, and his wisdom infallible. And many of the great potentates of the earth have paid their fealty, as though it was really so. One of them clad in canvas, going bare-foot in the depth of winter, (in obedience to the decree, stinting the pennance in proportion to the wickedness of princes) has waited many days for absolution at his pious ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. Another has thrown himself down prostrate a humble peni∣tent before him : He has placed his holy foot on the mo∣narchs profane neck as crushing a vermine, crawling out of the stable of his sovereignty; and others frequently kiss his toes with very profound devotion. These and such like triumphant signals of his sovereign power does he wear. And indeed if he is the universal monarch of the catholic church, princes that are members of it must needs knock under; for that in one world there cannot possibly be two <HI>Most High</HI>'s, any more than two <HI>Infinites.</HI> Thus you see the clergy, or gospel ministry of the christian world have so wisely handled business, and managed the gospel, that they have fairly (as they avouch) found a sovereign power bequeathed in it to the ministry of Christ, and romaging more warily and nicely, at last found a spiritual monarch, very compleatly furnished with the keys of all sorts of power hanging at his girdle; and may we not pronounce the wiser they! seeing the world growing weary of religi∣on, was willing to loll itself down to sleep, and leave them in sole trust with the whole interest of God's kingdom. But the sad enquiry is, whether this sort of government has not plainly subverted the design of the gospel, and the end for which Christ's government was ordained, viz. the moral, spiritual, and eternal happiness of men?</P>
<P>But I have no occasion to pursue this remark with tedi∣ous demonstrations: It's very plain, it's written with blood in capital letters, to be read at midnight by the flames of <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and other such like consecrated fires.
<PB N="37" REF="012626_0036_0F8B8F2DC508AE58"/>
That the government of this ecclesiastical monarch has in∣stead of sanctifying, absolutely debauched the world, and subverted all good christianity in it. So that without the least shew of any vain presumption we may infer, that God and wise nature were never propitious to the birth of this monster.</P>
<P N="2">2. An Aristocracy, which places the supream power in a se∣lect company of choice persons. Here I freely acknowledge were the gospel ministry established the subject of this power, viz. To will and do, in all church affairs without controul, &amp;c. This government might do to support the church in its most valuable rights, &amp;c. If we could be assured they would make the scripture, and not their pri∣vate will the rule of their personal and ministerial actions: and indeed upon these terms any species of government, might serve the great design of redemption; but consider∣ing how great an interest is embarked, and how frail a bot∣tom we trust, though we should rely upon the best of men, especially if we remember what is in the hearts of good men, (viz. much ignorance, abundance of small ends, many times cloked with a high pretence in rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion; pride skulking and often breeding revenge upon a small affront; and blown up by a pretended zeal; yet really and truly by nothing more divine than interest or ill nature) and also considering how very uncertain we are of the real good∣ness of those we esteem good men; and also how impossi∣ble it is to secure the intail of it to successors: and also if we remind how christianity by the foresaid principle has been peel'd, rob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and spolied already; it cannot consist with the light of nature to venture again upon such perils, especially if we can find a safer way home. More distinctly.</P>
<P>It is very plain (allowing me to speak emblematically) the primitive constitution of the churches was a democracy as appears by the foregoing parallel. But after the chris∣tian churches, were received into the favor of the imperial court, under the dominion of <HI>Constantine</HI> the great; there being many pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>liminaries which had furnished the minis∣ters with a disposition thereunto, they quickly deprived the fraternities of their rights in the government of the churches, when they were once provided of a plentiful maintenance though the liberality of <HI>Constantine,</HI> that when
<PB N="38" REF="012626_0037_0F8B8F2F2113FCB0"/>
christianity was so luxuriantly treated, as by his great bounty, and noble settlement, it is said there was a voice heard from heaven, saying, Now is P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> poured into the church. But the subversion of the constitution, is a story too long now to tell. Take therefore part of it, out of a late author well versed in antiquity, which may give some brief image of the whole.</P>
<P><HI>Non multa seculu jus Plebis Illaesum Mansit, neque Aliter Evenire Potuit, Quin Ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, vel amittatur, vel saltem di∣minuatur,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>De Ordina; Diss. Hystorica. P.</HI> 36.40, 41.</P>
<P>The right of the people did not remain unhurt through many ages; neither could it well be otherways, but that it must be lost, or much diminished. <HI>Zonaras</HI> does confess that heretofore bishops were chosen by the suffrage of the people. But many seditions happening among them; it was decreed that every bishop should hereafter be chosen by the authority of the bishops of every province. The cause seemed to be so very specious, that nothing could be more decent, or more conducive to the safety of the com∣mon wealth.</P>
<P>Yet (says my author) if you do well weigh the business, you must needs acknowledge nothing could have happened more pernicious or destructive to the church of God. For soon after these things came to pass, it is very obvious, that tyranny over the consciences of the faithful; and an intolerable pride every where grew rampant among the guides of the church. Yet there was one thing still very needful to be done; and that was to establish or confirm the power which the metropolitans, and bishops had ac∣quired to themselves. Therefore they fell to it tooth and nail to drive away the fraternity from all interest in electi∣ons: And alas poor hearts! They began to sleep with both ears; that then was scarce any enemy left to inter∣rupt, or controul the conquerors. This was the manner of the clergy till they had made themselves the subjects of all power, and then acted arbitrarily, and did what they pleased in the church of God.</P>
<P>But let the learned, knowing world consider, what the issue of all this was, <HI>scil.</HI> what a wretched capacity the drowsiness and cowardise of the people; and the usurpation and ambition of the ministry brought the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ofessing world
<PB N="39" REF="012626_0038_0F8B8F2F4DFD7390"/>
into. If those who were truly godly on both sides had in a few ages look'd down from heaven, and had eyed the fol∣lowing centuries, they might have beheld a world of mat∣ter for sorrowful impressions; to think that they them∣selves had occasioned the ruin of millions, by their remiss and passive temper in one sort; and too much humo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring, and nourishing pride, and high conceits of themselves and others, in the other; when as if they had stood firm to the government as left settled by the apostles; they had cer∣tainly prevented an apostacy that has damned, and con∣founded a great part of about thirty generations of men, women and children. That for my own part I can upon experience, in some measure truly say (to the history of the primitive churches in the loss of their government; and the consequents which followed, when I am impelled to repeat it to myself) as one <HI>Eneas</HI> said to queen <HI>Dido,</HI>
<Q><L>Infandum Regina Jubes Renovare Dolorem</L>
<L>—Quis talia fando</L>
<L>Temperet e Lacrimis!—</L></Q></P>
<P>So doleful a contemplation is it to think the world should be destroyed by those men, who by God were ordained to save it!</P>
<P>In a word, an aristocracy is a dangerous constitution, in the church of Christ; as it possesses the presbytery of all church power: What has been observed sufficiently evinces it. And not only so but from the nature of the constitu∣tion, for it has no more barrier to it, against the ambition, insults, and arbitrary measures of men, than an absolute monarchy. But to abbreviate; it seems most agreable with the light of nature, that if there be any of the regular government settled in the church of God it must needs be▪</P>
<P N="3">3. A democracy. This is a form government, which the light of nature does highly value, and often directs to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as most agreable to the just and natural prerogatives of human beings. This was of great account, in the early times of the world. And not only so, but upon the ex∣perience of several thousand years, after the world had been tumbled, and tost from one species of government to another, at a great expence ef blood and treasure, many of the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e nations of the world have shel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> themselves under it again; or at least have blendishe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and balanced their go∣vernments with it.</P>
<P>It is certainly a great truth, <HI>scil.</HI> That mans original
<PB N="40" REF="012626_0039_0F8B8F3005E450E8"/>
liberty after it is resigned, (yet under due restrictions) ought to be cherished in all wise governments; or otherwise a man in making himself a subject, he alters himself from a freeman, into a slave, which to do is repugnant to the law of nature. Also the natural equality of men amongst men must be duly favored; in that government was never established by God or nature, to give one man a preroga∣tive to insult over another; therefore in a civil, as well as in a natural state of being, a just equality is to be indulged so far, as that every man is bound to honor every man, which is agreable both with nature and religion, 1 Pet. 2.17. <HI>Honor all men.</HI> The end of all good government is to cultivate humanity, and promote the happiness of all, and the good of every man in all his rights, his life, liberty, estate, honor, &amp;c. without injury or abuse done to any. Then certainly it cannot easily be thought, that a company of men, that shall enter into a voluntary compact, to hold all power in their own hands, thereby to use and improve their united force, wisdom, riches and strength for the common and particular good of every member, as is the nature of a democracy; I say it cannot be that this sort of constitution, will so readily furnish those in government with an appetite, or disposition to prey upon each other, or embezle the common stock; as some particular persons may be apt to do when set off, and intrusted with the same power. And moreover this appears very natural, that when the aforesaid government or power, settled in all, when they have elected certain capable persons to minister in their affairs, and the said ministers remain accountable to the assembly; these officers must needs be under the influence of many wise cautions from their own thoughts (as well as under confinement by their commission) in their whole administration: And from thence it must needs follow that they will be more apt, and inclined to steer right for the main point, viz. The peculiar good, and benefit of the whole, and every particular member fairly and sincerely. And why may not these stand for very rational pleas in church order?</P>
<P>For certainly if Christ has settled any form of power in his church he has done it for his churches safety, and for the benefit of every member: Then he must needs be pre∣sumed to have made choice of that government as should least expose his people to hazard, either from the fraud,
<PB N="41" REF="012626_0040_0F8B8F3407AB7488"/>
or arbitrary measures of particular men. And it is as plain as day light, there is no species of government like a democracy to attain this end. There is but about two steps from an aristocracy to a monarchy, and from thence but one to a tyranny; an able standing force, and an ill nature, <HI>Ipso facto,</HI> turns an absolute monarch into a tyrant; this is obvious among the Roman <HI>Caesars,</HI> and through the world. And all these direful transmutations are easier in church affairs (from the different qualities of things) than in civil states. For what is it that cunning and learned men can't make the world swallow as an article of their creed, if they are once invested with an uncontroulable power, and are to be the standing orators to mankind in matters of faith and obedience? indeed some very wise and learned men are pleased to inveigh, and reproach the notion of a democracy in the church, which makes the <HI>Cetu fidelium</HI> or community of the faithful the first subject of the power of government. This they say tends to <HI>Brownism,</HI> and abhorred anarchy, and then say they upon such praemises, it must needs follow that every member of the body must be an officer; and then every one must preach and dispense the sacraments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Reply. Certainly such gentlemen, either designs to pose and baffle their reader with falacy; or they themselves never took up, or understood the true ideas of the several species of government; in that a democracy is as regular a form, and as particular as any other.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. An absolute or limited monarch can't manage the power or government devolved upon him, without the great officers of the crown, or a large set of ministers; though possibly he may with quicker dispatch issue out his decrees, yet he must execute all by his ministry. And why may not a democracy be indulged the same liberty? And this will prevent all anarchy or confusion most appa∣rently. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. The bitter pill to swallow in this doctrine of a demo∣cracy in the church, is the terrible power of life and death; or the accountableness of particular members to the assem∣bly, and especially those in the ministry; but yet this is agreable with the nature of the constitution, and easily
<PB N="42" REF="012626_0041_0F8B8F3642632908"/>
managed without anarchy, or popular confusion also, which would be made very evident, if we should but run the parallel in all points between the democracy of the state and church. But nextly from the premises, I shall</P>
<P N="3">3. Infer, That if these churches are not properly formed, yet are fairly established in their present order by the law of nature. And will they be advised, I would exhort them to try who will be so bold as to dare to disseize them. A monarchy has been tried in the church with a witness, but it has absolutely failed us. An aristocracy in a deep calm threw the democracy overboard, and took not only the helm in hand, but seized ship and cargo as their right and title; but after some time brought all to ship-wreck, and that in a good harbour too.</P>
<P>A democracy was the noble government which beat out in all the bad weather of ten bloody persecutions under the management of antiquity. And this is our constitution, and what can't we be pleased? This constitution is as a∣greable with the light and laws of nature as any other whatsoever, as has been fairly laid down and fully evinced, and more accommodated to the concerns of religion than any other. Therefore I shall now conclude my demonstra∣tion with this brief appeal to the common reason of man∣kind, viz.</P>
<P>How can it consist with the honorable terms man holds upon here on earth; that the best sort of men that we can find in the world; such men as are adorned with a double sett of enobling immunities, the first from nature, the other from grace; that these men when they enter into charter-party to man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge a trade for heaven, must <HI>ipso facto</HI> be clapt under a government, that is arbitrary and dispo∣tic; yea that carries the plain symptoms of a tyranny in it, when the light of nature knows of a better species, and frequently has made use of it? It wants no farther demon∣stration, for its most apparent, that nature is so much mis∣tress of herself, that man in a natural state of being, is un∣der God the first subject of all power, and therefore can make his own choice, and by deliberate compacts, settles his own conditions for the government of himself in a civil state of being: And when a government so settled shall throw itself from its foundations, or the subjects of sove∣reign power shall subvert or confound the constitution, they
<PB N="43" REF="012626_0042_0F8B8F374A8BEF98"/>
then degrade themselves; and so all power returns again to the people, who are the first owners. And what! Is man become so unfortunate, degraded and debased, as to be without all power in settling a government over himself, relating to the matters of his eternal well-being? Or when he comes back to a fathers house, must he fall into the capacity, of a meer passive being, and be put under such tutors, as can easily turn tyrants over him, and no relief left for him in his own hands; this is certainly most re∣pugnant to the light of nature, and very disagreable with the liberty and free genius of a gospel state. Nay, in a word, if the government of the churches be settled by God, either in the hands of a church monarch, or aristo∣cracy, and the people are no ways the subject of church power: Nay, if they are not under Christ, the fountain of power; then the reformation so called, is but a meer cheat, a schism, and notorious rebellion; neither is there room left for the least paliation, or shadow of excuse, for the reformers in renouncing their obedience to their pub∣lic governors. And the Martyrologies which pretend to immortalize the fame of eminent heroes, must be changed into chronicles, handing along an account of the just and deserved fate of a crew of rebels against God and govern∣ment; for what business had such a company of illiterate and crack brain'd fellows to meddle with their rulers, or examine into their administrations? for if they have no right of power in government, they stand absolutely bound to yield a passive obedience and non-resistance; and if they are so hardy and daring as to oppose their lawful rulers, the sharpest penalty in this world, is two easy for them; the inquisition is but dallying and playing with them, hell is their desert. But how it comes about that a state of grace, when in want of a suitable government, is become such a vassal, and wise and cunning nature is by her crea∣tor intrusted, and adorned with more enobling preroga∣tives, I must leave, and resign unto those learned men to solve, who plead for an aristocracy in the churches of Christ.</P>
<P>But to wind up the whole discourse in a few words, I acknowledge many objections may be here made, and se∣veral questions of moment might here fall under debate; but having obtained what I have principally sought for, in traversing the paths of nature, in the three following par∣ticulars; therefore with them, and with one objection an∣swered;
<PB N="44" REF="012626_0043_0F8B8F379C334CA0"/>
and also with some brief improvement of the grand hypothesis in this demonstration, I shall finish the argument.</P>
<P N="1">1. Three particulars; or so many golden maxims, se∣curing the honor of congregational churches.</P>
<P>Particular 1. That the people or fraternity under the gospel, are the first subject of power; or else religion sinks the dignity of human nature into a baser capacity with relation to ecclesiastical, than it is in, in a natural state of being with relation to civil government.</P>
<P>Particular 2. That a democracy in church or state, is a very honorable and regular government according to the dictates of right reason. And therefore,</P>
<P>Particular 3. That these churches of New-England, in their ancient constitution of church order; it being a democracy, are manifestly justified and defended by the law and light of nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. The objection. The plea from the law of nature for a democracy in the church, is as forceable for any other species of government; because nature is furnished with such a variety of schemes as has been pleaded to: And why may not the wise christian nations take which likes them best?</P>
<P>Answ. We must distinguish between man left solely to the direction of the law of nature, and as the subject of revelation, wherein divine wisdom may interpose; and determine on some particular species, without hurting or crossing the law of nature, Therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. I readily grant and acknowledge, a christian people may settle what species of government they please, when they are solely left to determine by the law of nature, what government in the church they will have. But then we must remember, that by the argument or concession, the power is originally in the people; and then our own case is secure and safe enough; both on the account of the re∣version of power, and especially, for that the people the first subjects of power, have been pleased to settle a de∣mocracy for their government, in the churches of this country. And if after the peaceable possession of about an hundred years, any persons can perswade them to alter their government into any other species, this will be less worthy of blame, than craftily, or unfairly to force it out of their hands.</P>
<P N="2">2. It's granted, that according to the light of nature,
<PB N="45" REF="012626_0044_0F8B8F384AD58F40"/>
there be various regular models of government; but if di∣vine wisdom is pleased to interpose and over-rule natures agitations, and cast the scales for this or that particular form, nature will be but fair mannered to submit to its author and rector. So that if we find that God has disclosed his mind by revelation, that his churches be the subjects of a democracy, then all stand obliged to comply under a double bond. And so we come under a proper crisis to enquire in the next place for scripture-evidence in the justification of these churches.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to it, I shall</P>
<P N="3">3. Make some brief improvement of the main <HI>Hypothesis</HI> in the demonstration; that is to say, if the government of the gospel churches, be a democracy, these consequences must necessarily follow, <HI>scil.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Cons.</HI> That the right of convoking councils eccle∣siastical, is in the churches.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Cons.</HI> That such a council has only consultative not a juridical power in it. A juridical power committed to such a representative body is both needless, and also dangerous to the distinct and perfect states they derive from. Compleat states settled upon a body of immutable and imperial laws as its basis, may want council; but to create a new subject of juridical power, is some way to endanger the being of the creators.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Cons.</HI> That all the members of an ecclesiastical council, deriving from a democracy are subjects of equal power. Whatever the power is, the several delegates must from the nature of the government they derive from, be equal sharers in it. Democratical states, in their repre∣sentative body can make but one house, because they have but one subject of supream power in their nature, and there∣fore their delegates, let them be who or what they may be, are under equal t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t; so that none can justly claim supe∣riority over their fellows, or pretend to a higher power in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> suffrage. Indeed in such kingdoms, where the sove∣reign power is distributed and settled in divers subjects, that the ballance of power may be more even, for the safety of the whole, and of all parts under all acts of sove∣reign power: From such a settlement of power, there arises several distinct states in the same government, which when convened as one subject of sovereign power, they make dif∣ferent houses in their grand sessions; and so one house o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="46" REF="012626_0045_0F8B8F3905023618"/>
state can negative another. But in every distinct house of these states, the members are equal in their vote; the most ayes make the affirmative vote, and most no's the nega∣tive: They don't weigh the intellectual furniture, or other distinguishing qualifications of the several voters in the scales of the golden rule of fellowship; they only add up the ayes, and the no's, and so determine the suffrage of the house.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="demonstration">
<HEAD>Demonstration III. From Holy Scripture.</HEAD>
<P>THIS plea has with such variety of argument, and illustration, and by many repetitions, been pursued, by a great number of persons emi∣nent for learning and piety, that I might here very fairly release myself from this task. But yet to compleat the number of my arguments, I will briefly sum up the de∣monstration for the readers use under a few heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. Head. It must needs be allowed, as a fundamental principle relating to government, that (under God) all power is originally in the people. No man I think will deny it to be a very sound principle in civil knowledge. But if any man will, I imagine it is sufficiently set forth in the former demonstration. And it is very plain that religion does always cultivate, and increase, rather than diminish any of natures just prerogatives. That it must needs stand for a paradox, or a riddle not to be expounded; if man is more of a slave by his religion than by his nature.</P>
<P>But let us take a brief view of man by scripture account under a religious notion, as the subject of grace, and he seems then not to have the least speck of vassalage in him; but is represented as though lord of himself and owner of heaven, and earth both, 1 Cor. 3.22.—<HI>all are yours.</HI></P>
<P>And though its very certain that man has greatly de∣based himself by his apostacy; yet still God puts abun∣dance of honor upon him in his reduction. As we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y consider man in a remark or two, under the measures of divine grace in restoring him to favor. First, God treats him as a creature of a very honorable character, as free and at his own dispose. Or as though he were some high and mighty state placed at the top of this globe. There∣fore he courts him into an alliance as though he were likely to yield great honor to the crown. <HI>We are ambassadors—
<PB N="47" REF="012626_0046_0F8B8F3A35D07188"/>
as though God did beseech you by us; we pray you in Christ's stead—be reconciled to God,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.20. This is much the tenor of Gods heralds in their addresses of capitulation. That certainly if God did not highly estimate man, as a creature exalted, by his reason, liberty and nobleness of nature, he would not caress him as he does in order to his submission; but rather with some peevish and haughty monarch, or the bloody Mahomet, send his demands at the mouth of his canon. But instead of such harsh mea∣sures, they are treated with the highest reason, attended with lenity and great acts of condescention. Nay, divine menaces are frequently cloathed with such soft language as this; <HI>turn ye! turn ye! Why will ye dye!</HI> Yea under all impulsive means, which God wisely and graciously makes use of to gain mans consent, he sets the will to turn about itself without forcing it, that so mans religion may be the free and candid emanations of his noble and ex∣alted nature. But when God has thus gained man; may we rationally imagine that in erecting his trophies he will assign and make him over to some petty and arbitrary po∣tentates in matters of religion? or settle him under a dis∣potic government as tho' he was the spoils of a spiteful war? No certainly, but man must now be considered as some high allie invested with more power than ever. This would still be more evident if we should consider what Christ has done and how they stand joint heirs with him in his purchase and kingdom, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1, 16, 17.</P>
<P N="2">2. Head. The power placed in man that enables him to manage religious affairs, is not sovereign, but limited and confined power. (1) All laws are enacted already, and, (2.) There is no coercive power needful in the church. The highest act in administring judicature, is excluding a person out of the society. In the church there is no fees or fines, &amp;c. In civil empire to keep mankind in any good decorum, there's much hard work to be done, in peace and war; under mein process, and in criminal causes. There's forming of armies, raising the posse comitatus, building of castles, &amp;c. cropping of ears, chopping off hands, and what not! so that civil government has need of an im∣mence power as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> treasure, and to be cloathed with brass and iron. But as for the church of God, faith, prayers and tears, are generally their best weapons against the hostility of foreigners; and in the government of their
<PB N="48" REF="012626_0047_0F8B8F3A9457EA90"/>
home-born, it may be done by soft words, or hard words, 1 Thes. 5.12. Heb. 3.13.—10.24.25. So that the business does not require abundance of external force, or form of government. That it's a thousand pities to make such a great noise and bustle in the world about church power, as though the subjects of it were to furnish armies and navies to encounter half the potentates on earth in de∣fence of the church. When alas good men! as to all occasion for power its quite another thing; and the exer∣cise of it generally falls within reach of an ordinary reason. That certainly whatever the right of the brotherhood is as to the original of power; there cannot be abundance of bad omens in allowing them some share in church judica∣tory.</P>
<P N="3">3. Head. Power—this word seems to be all thunder. But however; it is very copious and may be applyed to God and his creatures. It is predicable of the latter, in their different classes and orders of being, and none so weak but have some share of it. But to confine the word to polity, &amp;c. It is by some thus defined, viz.</P>
<P>Power or authority—Is that whereby a man may claim, or challenge any thing to ones self, without the injury of another, upon a supposition, this is a true definition.</P>
<P>Query. <HI>Whether christian people may not claim or chal∣lenge the following rights or prerogatives without doing in∣jury to any,</HI> viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether if they are pleased (a suitable number of them) to enter into a religious society, by punctual and voluntary compacts to support the worship of God in the world; whether this may not be done without injuring and then,</P>
<P N="2">2. When so united, whether they may not chuse their own officers. (3.) Discipline their own members. (4) Represent themselves upon proper emergencies, by their delegates; (all which are the principal pillars of a demo∣cracy,) whether I say they, can't do all these without in∣jury done to any others? But to proceed a little farther in opening the nature of power. If we unite <HI>Dunamis</HI> and <HI>Exousia, viz.</HI> Strength of nature, and authority of institu∣tion into one proposition. Then political power may be thus defined. <HI>scil.</HI></P>
<P>Power is an ability, furnished with a lawful right to act. Now upon a presumption of the validity of this proposi∣tion;
<PB N="49" REF="012626_0048_0F8B8F3B45F58EF8"/>
power may be easily apprehended as vested in every church, and in every member and officer of a church, ac∣cording to the nature, degree and duty of each subject of power; and may act and exert their several powers and authorities without any incongruity, or interfering one with another.</P>
<P N="4">4. Head. That a gospel church essentially considered as a body incorporated, is the subject of all church power. Though a church thus considered cannot formally exercise all branches of power belonging to it: neither can the subject of sovereign power itself exert all acts of power till fitted with proper organs or a suitable ministry, and yet it can't be denied but that all power really, and all acts of power virtually, must needs be in it. And so in a church.</P>
<P>Therefore as to church power in the exercise of it; it may be distributed into what belongs (1) To the combi∣nation of many, viz. The power of judgment and dona∣tion. Or, (2.) To what belongs to one or more set off for that end, viz. The power of office. This distribution Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI> pursues with great illustration. <HI>Surv. p.</HI> 1. <HI>p.</HI> 187. Here I shall confine myself to the consideration of the exercise of that power which belongs to the brother∣hood in distinction to office power. Which principle I shall pursue by evincing the truths of the following pro∣position. <HI>scil.</HI></P>
<P>That the scripture does warrant a government in gos∣pel churches, consisting of the exercise of several distinct powers inherent in the fraternity, in distinction to office trust. This may be evinced.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the recitation of the several distinct powers them∣selves.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the dignity which the scriptures puts upon the churches as free states, and subjects of power in distinction from their officers.</P>
<P N="1">1. By the recitation of the several distinct powers; both preparitory to, and resulting from their combination.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is a preparatory power in them both as ratio∣nal &amp; sanctified beings of forming themselves into churches. This affirmation seems to me as fully contained in the genuine sense of scripture, as though written in some di∣vine manifesto, in such terms as these, viz. Let this be
<PB N="50" REF="012626_0049_0F8B8F3EE2EB4CF0"/>
proclaimed through all the earth, that I the Lord Jesus Christ, have invested all holy and good christian people, both by nature and grace with power, to enter into church order, for the advance of my name, and their own edification. If we had such an article in scripture written in terms, we should have made great use of it in justifying our constitution; for it plainly settles all power original∣ly (under Christ) in the people. And then if such a power or faculty be in them when in separate parts, as to assemble, and enter into solemn engagements, and thereby to enter into a church state; it necessarily follows, that having imbodied they may easily go forward and provide for their own well-being. He that hath read the gospel, and observed how many churches are mentioned, without notice taken, of the manner of their origination, must needs allow the observation to be a fair consequence from it. It being so agreable with the light of nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. The powers resulting from their combination may be more distinctly recited.</P>
<P N="1">1. Power. The election of officers. Officers are for the well-being, and compleating of any state. There is no re∣gular government can well subsist without them; these are the hands, the eyes, the ears and feet of government in administration. To separate qualified persons to the highest office trust in a state, is by civilians attributed to the creating power of sovereignity. So that it must needs be a great power belonging to the church under this head, and that it is the churches prerogative I might rea∣son; <HI>Ex Jure Superioritatis.</HI> For that the church is supe∣rior to its officers; and not the officers to the church. For that churches are not made for officers, but officers for churches; therefore says the apostle, 1 Cor. 3.22. <HI>All things are yours—whether Paul, or Apollos or Cephas.</HI> But I shall principally depend upon the example and prac∣tice of the apostolical church under this head. It is a celebrated saying of <HI>Cyprian</HI> in pressing, Acts 1.26. To confirm the power of the people in chusing and refusing their officers. <HI>Plebs Christiana maxime potestatem habet, vel Dignos Sacerdotes Eligendi, vel indignos Recusandi.</HI> The highest power of electing worthy officers and rejecting unworthy is in the people. For the whole church, says <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rettinus (de Jure Vo.) Duos Eligit,</HI> chuses two to under∣go the lot for the apostleship, that they might supply the
<PB N="51" REF="012626_0050_0F8B8F411C260630"/>
vacancy by the death of <HI>Judas,</HI> Acts 1.23, 26. And in∣deed it is contrary to all civility and reason to imagine the apostles would be so trivial in their ministry, or prodigal of their own authority, as to indulge the fraternity in such actions, viz. Such as electing an extraordinary officer, if the election of officers did not belong to them. So in the choice of the deacons mentioned, Acts. 6.2, 3, 5. The twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them, and said—brethren look you out seven men, whom we may appoint over this business. The saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose Stephen, &amp;c. It must needs be very surprizing, if the apostles should thus dignify, and intrust the brethren with a prerogative of electing these officers, if the power of election was not inherent in them. That unless any one can fairly make it out that the apostles were either in jest, or did they know not what, in direct∣ing the brethren, to do as they did in the recited examples; it must needs stand for a truth that the power of electing officers is in the fraternity of the church, by the judgment of Christ's apostles.</P>
<P N="2">2. Power judicatory, Mat. 18.15, 20. This para∣graph of holy writ, lays open a scheme of juridical power in the subject of it; that is the church: and this is to be observed, that from the first commencement of the process to the final issue in the execution of the obstinate and criminal member, all is to be ascribed to the authority of the church; for what business has one man to interrupt another in his crimes and unlawful pleasures, unless he has power so to do? And how comes one man to have power over another, unless conquest, hostility, or compacts have made them liable, as members of the same community, or subjects of the same government? Therefore the offended person, proceeding regularly for detecting a delinquent, must needs be supposed to derive his power from the same fountain, viz. the sessions were the case is finally to issue by execution. And the subject of this power is the church. <HI>Tell the church.</HI></P>
<P>But moreover, let it be considered, that to speak by way of allusion, there be several removes of the action of trespass, from one hearing to another; as though it go from an inferior to a superior sessions, and that Christ was here in this precept, settling inferior and superior assizes in his kingdom. And indeed there cannot be a wiser
<PB N="52" REF="012626_0051_0F8B8F418514A8C0"/>
scheme drawn up, that shall carry the aspect of more grace, love, humility, tender regard to honour, and also justice than this; both for the encouragement of religion, the awing of spectators, and keeping the church pure.</P>
<P>But to proceed,</P>
<P N="1">1. In making out process, the first trial is to be had at the assizes of a mans own intellectual powers, reason, con∣science, &amp;c. being assembled, are to set in judgment, hear the pleas, and the indictment being read and justified, must pass sentence; and at this bar the case may be fairly issued. <HI>If he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother.</HI> So that most certainly the plaintiff has a right to enter his case at this sessions, and here we see it may be issued; then certainly this is a branch of the power of judicature; otherwise an agrieved person might expect a very severe repulse from a sturdier offender, for interrupting a mans repose of mind in his own actions. What saucy clown is that? who dare challenge my conscience with the cognizance of any crime? Bold-face! where's you commission; <HI>Who made thee a ruler,</HI> Acts 7.27. In civil affairs particular men when injured, must not make bold to correct an ordinary trespass upon their persons, or interests, but by forms of law; if they do, especially if by measures which are grievous, they may be indicted themselves, for disturbers of the peace; That certainly this branch of the text refers to a legal bar, and lawful power. So that the complaining party may commence his suit with boldness, produce his pleas, and demand justice. But the critical question is, <HI>Who is judge of this court?</HI> Certainly it is some lay-mans powers, supposed to be very competent judges, as suffici∣ently skilled in the rules of court, and how to apply them. And why may not all the judges contained in the whole series of judicatory laid open in this text, be of the same sort? for that the case is not so deep, but that the first judges and sessions it comes before, are supposed by our wise Saviour and law-giver, capable fully to understand and traverse it; and do justice and judgment upon it; to a final issue. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Upon a defeat the process goes forward, by remov∣ing the suit by an appeal to a more impartial hearing. The next sessions therefore by review, is to consist of one or two of the brethren. <HI>(Take one or two more.)</HI> But pos∣sibly some may be ready to say, ah! <HI>We are like to have
<PB N="53" REF="012626_0052_0F8B8F4249B89DF0"/>
very good justice, before so wise a sessions!</HI> Well, it is what Christ has appointed, and let us keep his path, and it will bring us safe home; for that these persons are commis∣sioned by Christ, as capable judges, and therefore are to exercise one branch of the power fixed in the church. But when the case is gone thus far through the law, and the adverse party will not submit to the last verdict that is brought in, the case must be removed again. For that,</P>
<P N="3">3. It is allowed to have one trial more, and no more; and that is to be before the church. For if he hear not the church, he shall be as an heathen man, &amp;c. that is to say, the church shall then issue out execution, which is the end of the law.</P>
<P>Object. But the great and stupendous objection, which crosses our way, is, that the governing church is here meant; that is to say, the presbytery in their classes, and several sessions, till you come home to the last appeal?</P>
<P>Answ. 1. It is very unscriptural to force such an inter∣pretation on the text; for if we consider the etimology, and universal acceptation of the word church, the objection will be found very defective, both in its rhetori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k and divinity. There being no harbour for it, within the sense of <HI>Farniby</HI>'s tropes or figures. And as for its divinity, let the objection but cite one text more, wherein church is mentioned, and officers are intended, and we will resign. But without it to yield so great an interest upon so slender a claim is repugnant to justice and honor. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. How can wise men manage their souls, or bring them into such a figure as to think that Christ should have such a far reach in his thoughts in such easy cases as are plainly contained in the text? The notions in the objec∣tions are plainly ridiculous to the light of nature, in that civil measures adjust according to the degree and nature of suits and cases. A cause of twelve-pence is triable by a single justice, and one a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>peal brings the suit to the end of the law. Indeed cases which are of greater weight and value have a larger scope in the law allowed them, &amp;c. And what! Is there the least shadow for a pretence that such cases as are within our text, viz. such as may be issued by one single brother making his suit to his brothers reason and cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ience, &amp;c. or by two at the most, and that at the sole charge of a few honest pleas from the heads of charity or piety? I say, are these cases so grand as to be trans∣mitted from one classis to another, till they arrive at the
<PB N="54" REF="012626_0053_0F8B8F42E08E4A20"/>
chief seat where the definitive sentence is to be given forth? There is apparently some great fallacy in the objection, or certainly our blessed Saviour did not state his cases right; for let us again consider, who must sign the bill of cost at last? or who must bear all the charges of writings, witnesses, travels of horses and men; and for all expence of time and money, from the sessions first mentioned, and so from sessions to sessions, and from classis to classis, until all is brought to a final issue? when as possibly the original writ of process, or first action, might not contain in real civil damage, a farthing more than about a groat or six-pence. And what can we think that our wise Saviour would adjust his settlements at no better a rate than this comes to? <HI>vah! proh Dolor!</HI> Men have plainly made a fool of mankind by corrupting this text, whereby they have set the discipline of the church at such a charge, that millions of millions have run out in waste, to humour their ambition; when as the wise and innocent churches of God in their single capacities would have done better justice, and have drained nothing more from you, than some tears of contrition.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="3">3. What is more natural, than to imagine a church of believers, with their set of graces, and common prudence, (especially when under the influence of a regular ministry) should be held capable to execute this rule, according to the full sense of it; yea, tho' they bring the delinquent in the traverse of the case, to the highest censure. Indeed it must be acknowledged, that excommunication, major or minor, is an awful result of authority; yet not really in every respect, and in all degrees quite so bitter as death it∣self: And yet death is very frequently dispens'd to capital sinners, and that solely by the verdict of their peers, viz. Twenty-four good and lawful men of the vicinage, are in forms of law a sufficent judicatory to take away a mans life, and the venerable bench of judges must not over-rule, but stand and say, Amen, in that good justice is done in the world by such a small company of illiterate men, the law having assigned them to this service. To the foregoing precept, let us join Col. 4.17. 1 Cor. 5.12. Rev. 2.20. 1 Thes. 5.14. Gal. 6.1.</P>
<P>Now to conclude, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the reader lay all these scriptures together, which contain rules of judicatory for the churches;
<PB N="55" REF="012626_0054_0F8B8F4388AE03F0"/>
and then let him answer me with good reason if h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> can, and tell me why these scriptures may not be esteemed the churches <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> in matters of censure and judica∣ture; as well as that be held such a golden rule in the judicial proceedings of English government, mentioned in the great charter of English liberties, chap. 29. No freeman shall be taken, or imprisoned, or be disseised of his freehold, liberty or free customs, or be out-law'd or ex∣iled, or any other ways destroyed, nor will we press upon him nor condemn him, but by lawful judgment of his peers. Now gentlemen! Don't you think that the Lord Jesus Christ, the king of heaven, is as careful and tender of his subjects, as the king of England is of his? And indeed, why should not each sett of subjects be equally and alike guarded from the hazard of oppression, or the arbi∣trary measures of each ministry unless those that belong to the gospel, are formed out of a distinct clay from each other?</P>
<P N="3">3. Power. To represent themselves in synodical con∣ventions, for the establishment of this power in the churches. See Acts 15.2.22.23. And for a more ample display and confirmation of this point, I refer the reader to the excellent treatise of Dr. <HI>Increase Mather,</HI> in his disquisition concerning <HI>ecclesiastical councils.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The dignity which the scripture puts upon the churches as free states, and subjects of power in distinction from their officers.</P>
<P>It is very plain that most of the epistles of St. <HI>Paul</HI> which make up a great part of the canon of scripture, were directed to the body of the brotherhood, and peculi∣arly adapted for their use, with little or no notice at all taken of the ministry therein.</P>
<P>In sum, when he was just concluding his letter and winding up his discourse with his grace and respects to some choice christian friends, he puts the officers in with them, and orders the brotherhood to give his salutations to them as persons unconcerned with the contents of the epistle, Heb. 13.24. In the last verse but one in the whole epistle, says the apostle, <HI>Salute all them that have the rule over.</HI> That whatever other meanings may be in such methods of divine writings, they must needs respect some high powers and trust vested in the churches. Those epistles sent to the angels of the churches of <HI>Asia</HI>; the principal share of those letters literally taken, which belonged to the officers,
<PB N="56" REF="012626_0055_0F8B8F4444975AA0"/>
is but the superscription; the contents of the letters are immediately directed to the fraternity. Where there is any thing amiss the fraternity is reprehended: Where there is any thing worthy of credit, they are commended. Or if there is any thing in point of order or discipline to be done they are directed and commanded. All is to the churches. Therefore it is said again and again, <HI>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches,</HI> Rev. 1.7, &amp;c. Finally, let any con∣siderate man but read and well ponder the epistles to the <HI>Corinthian, Ephesian,</HI> &amp;c. churches, and observe the characters of the brotherhood; with the precepts how they shall act personally and with authority one towards another, &amp;c. he must then needs subject his mind to the force of this conclusion, <HI>scil.</HI> That Christ's gospel churches in their fra∣ternities, are not such cyphers as they stand in some men's accounts; but are really and truly proper bodies full of powers, and authorities, for the government of themselves and all their concerns, as all democracies are.</P>

<P>From the excellent nature of the constitution, in that it exceeds all that have been yet extant in the christian world. This I shall endeavor to illustrate by three pleas. <HI>Plea</HI> I.</P>
<P>In that it best suits the great and noble designs of the gospel, and that in a peculiar manner as it tends to the promoting holiness in the world; not only from the strict nature of the constitution in the admission of members, whence the churches become a more exact emblem of hea∣ven, both for the illuminating and dreading of others, that beholding their goodness, may glorify God in the day of visitation. 1 Pet. 2.12. But from the great advantage put into the hands of the best sort of men, (solid, pious, wise and unbias'd men) of furnishing a country with per∣sons eminently qualified for the ministry, and keeping them so. There is no lurking place for <HI>Symony</HI> in this constitution. There is no buying and selling of offices, whereby the world has been miserably cheated, and de∣bauched. Here is no back stairs for cousins and favorites to climb up to high seats without desert; it is merit and in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rinsic worth sets the value, and holds the strongest plea for preferment here. Hence every village, and corner of a town, where religious congregations are settled, are furnished with persons for the gospel ministry of such
<PB N="57" REF="012626_0056_0F8B8F4504AFE3E0"/>
learning, and bright saints, and of such real and distinguish∣ing virtue and zeal; that they must needs be very preva∣lent in carrying on the main design, &amp;c. But this plea is fully pursued by Dr. Owen, in his enquiry, &amp;c. (p. 120 and so on) whither I refer the reader that wants more sa∣tisfaction.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="plea">
<HEAD>Plea II.</HEAD>
<P>For that it has the best ballance belonging to it of any church-government in the world. Other governments have generally too high a top, and are very lopsided too; nay the best we can meet with without vanity or envy it may be said, that not only seemingly like <HI>Grantham</HI> steeple, but really it stands awry, and being so overloaded on na∣ture's corrupt side, with learning, power and high trust, it plainly hangs over several degrees from a true perpen∣dicular, towards Babylon: And if it falls it buries you; and then you must remember it has monopolized all power, so that you have none left to stir under your load, or creep out with. But here's a government so exactly poised, that it keeps its motions regular like the stupenduous spheres, unless some <HI>Phaeton</HI> chance to mount the chariot box, and becomes the driver. I have sufficiently, I think, evinced the power in the brotherhood; and though every church is a body consisting of very numerous parts and a noble m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nistry, yet the balance of power is very exactly and with great advantage preserved; both between the members of the body in general, and between themselves, and their public ministry in special.</P>
<P N="1">1. Between the members of the body. For besides, the wisdom, love and other enobling principles, in some measure actuating every member. The venerable major vote, which guides and governs the august states of parlia∣ments; nay all assembly's superior and inferior, that have any equality of power dispersed amongst the members, or∣dinarily keeps the whole body, in all points of administra∣tion, in an exact equipoise.</P>
<P N="2">2. And as for the state of the ministry; there is no grain of allowance wanted on their side, to make their office power, if not an even ballance arithmetically upon an accurate, and distressing trial: yet in the series of a laudable ministration, it is an equivalent of power; at least according to the terms of our constitution, <HI>Platf. C.</HI> 10. <HI>Sect.</HI> 11. But let the case be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated as accurately,
<PB N="58" REF="012626_0057_0F8B8F46197FFFF8"/>
as may be, and let every fair principle which grants the power to be originally in the people, be yielded: and also establish a proper judicature in the brotherhood; yet it's apparent in all examples, that the ministry of this consti∣tution are held, if not in proper speaking; yet in con∣science, and religious courtesie, as though all power were invested in them; or at least to such a degree that there is no appearance of what many render the government grevious to them, if they are but contented, to be the masters of an assembly of free-men, and not of slaves. Amongst abundance of illustrations I will mention two.</P>
<P N="1">1. The great veneration in man's mind towards those who are sensibly cloathed with authority. <HI>If I am a fa∣ther where it my honor, if a master where is my fear,</HI> Mat. 1.6. The prophet reasons from the law of nature; there being such a property planted in the soul by its maker to revere superiors, and especially men in public trust. And also the authority shining in them, being such bright rays both of the divine majesty and benignity, there being such a sensible good and benefit accruing thereby, to the rest of mankind, hence springs a universal disposition to obedience and submission, this is obvious through the whole civil ministry of the world; there is no need to make every judge in commission, or chief magistrate a sovereign prince to gain homage to him. No! but as soon as a man ap∣pears vested with authority, there is that in the soul of another which teaches reverence and obedience to him in his trust, both from the suggestions of fear and sense of interest. So that a learned, painful and pious ministry in∣trusted with the souls and happiness of men; and taking indefatigable care to secure eternal life for them, has a most charming and endearing aspect and influence upon all the rational powers. In so much that nature itself has a high value for such subjects of trust. And as for grace its ready to be lavish of its victims.—ye received me as an angel of God even as Christ Jesus.—If it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.14, 15. If any man doubts of the validity of this plea, let him but view what conquests have been made by the abuse of these principles, and you will find the ministry of the christian world have far exceeded <HI>Caesar,</HI> in subduing mankind; for from an honest obedience they have brought them to lye down, &amp;
<PB N="59" REF="012626_0058_0F8B8F46C2C463A8"/>
be trampled on by their spiritual owners. That there is no danger on the poople's side when things are well stated, if there be but a wise and due management on the other.</P>
<P>And still it is more evident.</P>
<P N="2">2. From the extent of commission, with the many enob∣ling prerogatives fixed in their trust. Though they are the ministry, and but the ministry of a democracy, their commission is so large, and high-prerogatives so numerous, they carry so great an appearance, as though in reality they were the subjects of all power. And I think it is so from the nature and modes of all regular government; for when a government has enacted their laws and precepts, and settled their ministry, they leave the sway of things to them; that it is as tho' they had resigned all the power to their ministry: So it is peculiarly in the affairs of gospel churches. That let men at their leisure view this illustra∣tion by the scripture, our platform, and by the laws and customs of nations, and they will find it a truth. That certainly a painful ministry may easily be reconciled to our constitution, unless they are raised to that temper of mind as he was, who had this for his motto, <HI>Aut Caesar▪ aut Nihil.</HI> A <HI>Caesar</HI> or nothing.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="plea">
<HEAD><HI>Plea</HI> III.</HEAD>
<P>From the near affinity our constitution holds with the civil governments of some of the most flourishing common-wealths in the world. It's certain, every species of go∣vernment simple and mixt, have their various excellencies and defects; much may be said in honor of each, and also every constitution may have something wanting; at least it may seem so, under a more critical survey of its nature, principles, ill-conveniencies, corrupt ministry, mis∣fortunes, &amp;c. And many times a government falls under scandal from distemper of mind, from false ends and cor∣rupt interests, which sway and over-rule mens thoughts relating to government, more than from the constitution itself. But however, to evade all circular discourses, we may very fairly infer, where we find nations flourishing, and their liberty and property, with the rest o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the great immunities of mans nature nourished, secured, and best guarded from tyranny, we may venture to pronounce this people to be the subjects of a noble government, and there be many such on earth, whose constitution will serve to justify ours. I shall instance in three, and no more.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="60" REF="012626_0059_0F8B8F48EF14CF88"/>1. The <HI>Venetian</HI> common-wealth; though some are pleased to call the government of this free state, an aristo∣cracy; but it seems more properly a limited democracy; for that the seat of sovereign power is their ancient com∣mons, called their families, enrolled in the golden book; these make up the grand council of the nations, settle the public ministry, and enact laws, &amp;c. This people have by this mode of government raised themselves into so august and flourishing a capacity, that from a very obscure origi∣nal, they are grown to that degree, as to bridle and curb the pride and haughtiness of Turk and Pope. This ex∣ample must needs be no small honor to our constitution.</P>
<P>But,</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Belgick</HI> provinces are without interruption al∣lowed to be the subjects of a formed democracy, they in some ages past being insulted, and unmercifully trampled upon by that august tyrant, the Spanish Monarch; they being his subjects broke loose from him, and set up for themselves. They assumed to themselves their original power, and when they had got it into their hands, had the wit, and kept it, and have improved it in the form of a democracy to this day, and God has blest them: That from the poor states of Holland, they are now grown to wear the splendid title of <HI>Their High Mightinesses,</HI> and are a match for most monarchs on earth. Says Gordon of their government: The seven provinces of Holland being under a democratical government, are as it were several common-wealths; each province being a distinct state; yea, and every city having an independent power within itself to judge of all causes, whether civil or criminal, and to inflict even capital punishments; but all joining toge∣ther, make one republic, the most considerable in the world.</P>
<P><HI>Query.</HI> Whether such examples of popular governments now extant on earth, and yielding such vast advantages to the subjects, and being so regular and practicable; I say, whether they may not justly deter all men from reproach∣ing our constitution with the scandalous title of anarchy, unless they will allow us to prepare a chronicle for them, and therein publish to the world their profound ignorance of the several species of government; and the distinct way of placing and exercising various powers in them. 3. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re Engli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. This nation is repated to be the sub∣jects
<PB N="61" REF="012626_0060_0F8B8F4B227F63F0"/>
of the finest and most incomparable government in the world. And this original happy form of government, is (says one) truly and properly called an English man's liberty: a privilege to be freed in person and estate from arbitrary violence and oppression; and a greater inheritance than we derive from our parents. And this birth-right of English men shines most conspiciously in two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. In Parliaments; wherein the subject has by his re∣presentatives, a share in legislative power: And so makes his own laws, and disposes of his own money.</P>
<P N="2">2. In Jury's; whereby he has a share in the executive part of law, so that no causes are tried, nor any man ad∣judged to lose his life, member or estate, but upon the verdict of his peers; his equal or neighbours, and of his own condition. These two grand pillars of English liberty, are the fundamental vital privileges whereby we have been, and are still preserved more free and happy, than any other people in the world; and we trust shall ever continue so. For whosoever shall design to impair, pervert, or undermine either of these, do strike at the very constitution of our government, and ought to be prosecuted and punished, with the utmost zeal and vigour.—For to poyson all the springs and rivers in the kingdom, could not be a greater mifchief; for this would only affect the present age, but the other would ruin and enslave all our posterity. I shall improve this example by three Queries.</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 1. Ah! What's the matter with <HI>English</HI> men, men of such courage to be surprized with such fear, as tho' they were like to be taken captive, and turned into slaves in their own home? Why, in good truth, there may be a reason for it; therefore it becomes them to be very careful under this head; for if they make themselves slaves in their own country, or let others do it for them, when they can prevent it, they both deny God who made and redeemed them, and plainly violate the law of nature?</P>
<P><HI>Query.</HI> 2. Who is it English men are thus afraid of? Who do they thus reflect upon in their frights and fears? It is neither France nor the great Turk which dreads them! therefore it must needs be some body or another nearer home that threatens their liberty. And may not New-England's gospel liberties deserve so much fear and cau∣tion,
<PB N="62" REF="012626_0061_0F8B8F4BC3C491B0"/>
although it should so happen that some body should be reflected upon by their cautiousness.</P>
<P><HI>Query.</HI> 3. If the settling such immunities, as the privilege of parliaments and juries in the hands of the peo∣ple be such effectual barriers to preserve a nation from tyranny and slavery; then whether when gospel churches have the means in their own power, it been't their wisdom to keep up the like barrier, or something equivalent there∣to; that they may preserve themselves safe from the arbi∣trary measures of their own ministry? or thus, whether for English men, when their liberties in church or state are fast lockt up for them and their posterity by law and regular settlements, it been't their best way to beware how they repeal those laws, or weaken those settlements?</P>
<P>But at present I shall leave it to other men to run the parrallel between our constitution, and the several govern∣ments I have mentioned, and infer what more they shall think proper; only leaving to myself the liberty to con∣clude, that the several examples of civil states, which I have named, do serve abundantly to justify the noble nature of our constitution in church-order; for that the several famous and august nations which I have mentioned, in all their glory at home, and success in arms and trade abroad; their several governments which have brought them to all this, are either a perfect democracy, or very much mixed and blendished with it.</P>
<P>Then why should we in New-England be any more ashamed, or less careful of our church-government, which keeps us from tyranny and slavery in the concerns of our consciences, than those nations are of their civil govern∣ment, whereby they are preserved from the like damnable circumstances in the concerns of their outward life, and natural rights and fortunes?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="demonstration">
<HEAD>Demonstration V.</HEAD>
<P>From the dignity which the providence of God has put upon the constitution, both in the first ages of the christian churches and in the last century.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the first ages of the christian churches God has put many marks of distinguishing favour upon this constitution, both in the smiles and frowns of his providence.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the smiles of providence upon the churches, whilst they continued compleat in their constitution. I shall offer but three parti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulars to justify this observation.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="63" REF="012626_0062_0F8B8F4D9E2F3BE0"/>1. In the great and admirable success of the gospel, in the conversion of so many nations.</P>
<P N="2">2. In their singular purity, and virtuous deportment in the midst of a corrupt world. That (as Mr. Cotton ob∣serves) was a general eulogy belonging to their members, and ascribed to them by the wiser sort of heathen, <HI>scil. Bonus vir, tantum Christianus,</HI> He is a good man only is a christian.</P>
<P N="3">3. They were eminently supported and carried on by the grace and providence of God through all their direful sufferings; the more they were wasted and destroyed, the more they grew and increased, as Israel in Egypt. Indeed whilst they remained firm to their constitution, they were not only like an army in banners, but in reality the greatest conquerors that ever appeared on earth. They merely baffled the bravery of the old Roman spirit, and were quite too hard for those who had vanquished the world. I have seen, says <HI>Eusebius,</HI> the executioner (tired with tormenting them) lye down panting and breathing, &amp;c. But I never saw the martyrs weary of sufferings, nor heard them desire a truce: Nay, were rather ambitious of the longest and most terrible sufferings, that they might be martyrs in every member. Thus the churches endured hardness as good soldiers of Christ, thro' ten bloody persecutions; and at last retreated by divine providence, under the um∣brage of the great <HI>Constantine.</HI> And there the churches of God made the finest show that ever was seen on earth, next to Christ in his transfiguration. Till this time the churches remained the subjects of their democratical government in some good measure though there were some symptoms of an alteration in the last century, but indeed after the churches were freed from the rage of heathen persecutors, there quickly followed the perfect subversion of their order.</P>
<P>So we come,</P>
<P N="2">2. To consider the frowns of Providence that pursued the christian world after the subversion of their primitive constitution. Sufficient observations have been made un∣der the foregoing demonstrations, setting forth the change of government which was made in the churches. And in short, it was really and properly the altering the minis∣try of a democracy into an aristocracy; for to speak plainly, the public officers to gratify their ambition, took all the power into their own hands, and settled all affairs and
<PB N="64" REF="012626_0063_0F8B8F4E690B5AD0"/>
concerns acccording to their own minds without controul. But let us eye the providence of God, and we may observe that God did soon stain the pride and glory of these men; especially in two eminent instances of his displeasure, which I shall only mention.</P>
<P><HI>Instance.</HI> 1. In the fatal <HI>Arian</HI> heresy, that spread it self like some mortal contagion, thro' the christian world? that it was said the whole world was become an <HI>Arian. Arius</HI> was the author of this damnable doctrine, viz. That our Saviour Christ was neither God, nor eternal, but a creature; and that he assumed only the body, not the soul of man, &amp;c. This damnable heresy soon spread itself far and wide; the author was in the heighth of his wicked∣ness, and fell a victim to divine vengeance in the latter part of <HI>Constantine</HI>'s reign: But his heresy continued and prevailed, and especially amongst the clergy. But this is very awful to observe, that when these men by their wit and cunning had once cozened and cheated the fraternity of their ancient rights and prerogatives, God left the devil to cheat and deceive them, as wise and learned as they were, of their true religion and souls together. What good did all their legerdemain to them now? Had not they better have kept holy and humble pastors, confined to their parochial diocesses, and known and loved and preach't Christ the eternal Son of God, and him crucified, rather then stretcht their boundary like sovereign princes, and so left to perish under such a dreadful dispensation, as the fruit of their ambition and infidelity?</P>
<P>To me (considering the commencement, the deadly na∣ture, the rage, the universal prevalence and continuance of this damnable heresy) it seems as though God had lookt down from heaven, and viewed the sacrilegious robbery commitied upon the churches with detestation. And there∣fore summonned a congress of the several states of the other world. (1 Kings 22.19. I saw the Lord sitting on his throne) and issuing out proclamation.—Be it known! That never has a nobler cause been so baffled and sacri∣legiously betrayed by the dignified trustees of it as this. I have been down amongst my golden candlesticks, my fa∣mous churches; I find the fraternity drowsy and remiss, setting two low a value on their ine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>timable rights. And those who should rowse them from their security and in∣cogitancy, rather esteem it a lucky omen; and therefore
<PB N="65" REF="012626_0064_0F8B8F4EC76FE288"/>
to satiate their own ambition (instead of advising, and di∣recting the churches in the study of their constitution; and so plead their cause for them) they consult how to defraud them, they wrest the scripture, darken all places which settle their titles, and to end all disputes threaten them Diotrephes like (3 <HI>Joh.</HI> 10.) with the secular power that is now on their side. That they have at last absolute∣ly supplanted them, stript and taken away the rights be∣longing to the churches, and purchased at so dear a rate. That as though the Almighty should say, my patience is out! And my justice has prepared a cup of confusion for them; Who! of all this convocation will go and hand it to them? And there came forth several legions with an arch-devil at the head of them, and stood before the Lord, and said, we will go and persuade them; and God said, you shall persuade them, and prevail also; therefore go forth and do so, 1 Kings 22.22. As though God should say, I have now in displeasure abandoned them to ruin; they who should have had a zealous regard to my settlements and as one chief end of their ministry, should have sought the happiness of the people, and not their own ease, vain glory, pride and luxury; now leave them exposed to obliterate the essentials of their faith, and so fall a sacrifice to divine fury. Go you malignant powers do your worst, the hedges are now down.</P>
<P><HI>Instance</HI> 2. The universal apostacy that has followed the subversion of the old constitution. We may in some degree date Gods departure from his churches when they began to subvert the order of them, and so gradually with∣drew, till he—at last left them to perish by whole ages together. It must not, indeed, be thought, or said, but that God had a remnant through many ages, who con∣tinued orthodox in faith, both in the ministry and brother∣hood. But yet it is very obvious that christianity <HI>Gradatim,</HI> declined till all was swallowed up in a universal and direful apostacy, never sufficiently to be deplored; neither fully exprest, unless we transcribe the volumns that contain it. I do account indeed that the destruction of the churches, in moral speaking, may be attributed immediately and nextly to other causes, as ignorance, pride, hypocrisy, &amp;c. But remotely to the dissolution of the order of them. For that the constitution forenamed was adjusted by divine
<PB N="66" REF="012626_0065_0F8B8F4F8BE21958"/>
wisdom for preventing and remedying such maladies as proved the ruin of the churches; that when the remedy was quite taken away, bad humours predominate, and symptoms of a deadly aspect appear, and so death inevita∣bly follows.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the last century God has been very admirable in the works of providence, and has therein highly dignify∣ed our constitution. And we want no other evidence under this head than the recognition of what God has done for these famous English colonies in North-America; who have all along distinguished themselves, from all the world, by their singular regard both to the faith and practice of the true religion. Now let any other constitution on earth but parrallel ours; in the eminent shines of providence and in religious effects, and we will resign the whole cause. But whilst then, we will go on and rejoice in the grace of God, that we in these countries, are by his good providence over us, the subjects of the most ancient, ratio∣nal &amp; noble constitution in church order that ever was, will be, or can be; whilst the laws of nature and grace remain unrepeal'd. For that it is a constitution which infinite wisdom hath authorized and founded in the law of nature; and his omniscient providence has eminently honored, and dignified, both by the smiles and frowns of his countenance, through all the ages of the christian world to this very morning. And though some of the reverend churches within this grand consociation (who settled upon the same platform with us) have with two great a precipitation made a defection from the constitution: Yet this is our comfort, that their alteration is not so firm, as the laws of the Medes and Persians; for that those who turned them off, may by the same power bring them on to their old basis again. And let Christ pity, and help them. For cer∣tainly their present state is portentous, from what may be observed from the proceedings of providence through the whole christian Aera, unto this day.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>The Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>I shall now conclude my whole essay, by annexing the joint testimony of those eminent men, fathers in these churches, now in glory. viz. The reverend Mr. John
<PB N="67" REF="012626_0066_0F8B8F504CDBA810"/>
Higginson, and the reverend Mr. William Hubbard. And the rather because Mr. Hubbard did some time before his death, desire to have their testimony re-printed, and live with some other book which it might properly accompany. I am well satisfied the foregoing subject is the most proper companion, their testimony could have light on, in its travels through the world: I therefore make bold to invite the said testimony, to set out again with fresh courage, and improve its excellent language, toge∣ther with former acceptance it found with the churches to ingratiate and bespeak favor for this small treatise, its new allie and fellow-traveller.</P>
<P>And let the holy churches (for whom these now appear in joint testimony to confirm their divine pedigree) flourish in their strength, beauty and order, after this triumvirate shall sink under the tyranny of moths, and human forget∣fulness, and lye down in the house of oblivion; where I hope the enemies of the constitution will be gotten down before them, and there fast buried in their own bones and dust.</P>
<P>But least any should think it absurd, that I here produce such venerable authority in way of epilogue, which should rather in honor have been placed in the front of this at∣tempt. To this I reply, that in honor and prudence I chuse here to place these worthies. For you must note; I am now retreating out of the field of battle, and I hope upon honorable terms too; and then the reer is the highest place in dignity; so that though they are bringers-up, its no diminution to them. And not only so, but out of prudent conduct; for though I presume the enemy is fairly van∣quished, yet some forlorn party may rally, and to gratify their desperate fortune may disturb us, but I hope these valiant and wise commanders thus posted, will secure our reer, beat back the enemy, and bring all off with tri∣umph.</P>

<PB N="68" REF="012626_0067_0F8B8F52C3ADC9A8"/>
<HEAD>A TESTIMONY To the <HI>order of the gospel,</HI> in the churches of <HI>New-England:</HI> Left in the hands of the churches, by the two most aged ministers of the gospel, yet surviving in the country.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. ABOVE seventy years have passed away, since one of us, and above sixty, since the other of us came into <HI>New-England, and hav∣ing obtained help from God, we continue to this day.</HI></P>
<P>We are therefore capable to make some comparison, between the condition of the churches, when they were first erected in this country, and the condition into which they are now fallen, and more falling every day.</P>
<P>But we wish, that in making this comparison, we had not cause to take the place, and the part of those old men, that saw the young men shouting aloud for joy, at the new temple, <HI>Ezra.</HI> 3.12. Ancient men that had seen the first house; when the foundation of this house <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice.</P>
<P N="2">2. We are under a daily expectation of our call to ap∣pear before our Lord Jesus Christ; and we have reason to be above all things concerned, that we may give up our account with joy unto him. That we may be the better able to do so, we judge it necessary for us to leave in the hands of the churches, a brief testimony, to the cause of God and his people in this land. And this the rather, because we are sensible that there is risen and rising among us, a number who not only forsake the right ways of the Lord, wherein these holy churches have walked, but also labour to carry away as many others with them as they can.</P>
<P>We are also informed, that many younger men of great worth, and hearty friends unto the church-state of the country, scarce know what interpretation to put upon it; but find it a sensible disadvantage unto them, that the elder men are so silent, and remiss upon the manifest occa∣sions, that call aloud for us to open our mouth in the cause of churches that we should be loth to see led unto des∣truction.</P>
<P N="3">3. We that saw the persons, who from four famous colo∣nies,
<PB N="69" REF="012626_0068_0F8B8F52EAC96650"/>
assembled in the synod, that agreed on our platform of Church Discipline, cannot forget their excellent charac∣ter. They were men of great renown in the nation, from whence the Laudian persecution exiled them; their learn∣ing, their holiness, their gravity, struck all men that knew them with admiration. They were Timothies in their houses, Chrysostomes in their pulpits, Augustines in their disputations. The prayers, the studies, the humble en∣quiries, with which they sought after the mind of God, were as likely to prosper as any mens upon earth. And the sufferings wherein they were confessors for the name and the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ, add unto the argu∣ments which would perswade us, that our gracious Lord would reward and honor them, with communicating much of his truth unto them. The famous Brightman had fore∣told, <HI>Clariorem lucem adhuc Solitudo dabit, &amp;c.</HI> God would yet reveal more of the true church-state unto some of his faithful servants, whom he would send into a wilderness, that he might there have communion with them. And it was eminently accomplished in what was done for and by the men of God, that first erected churches for him in this American wilderness.</P>
<P>We do therefore in the first place, earnestly testify, That if any who are given to change, do rise up to unhinge the well established churches in this land, it will be the duty and interest of the churches, to examine, whether the men of this trespass, are more prayerful, more watchful, more zealous, more patient, more heavenly, more universally conscientious, and harder students, and better scholars, and more willing to be informed and advised, than those great and good men, who left unto the churches what they now enjoy: If they be not so, it will be wisdom for the children to forbear pulling down with their own hands, the houses of God, which were built by their wiser fathers, until they have better satisfaction.</P>
<P>It is not yet forgot by some surviving ear-witnesses of it, that when the Synod had finished the Platform of Church Discipline, they did with an extraordinary eleva∣tion of soul and voice, then sing together, the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, in the fif∣teenth chapter of the revelation: God forbid, that in the loss of that holy Discipline, there should be hereafter occasion to sing about breaking down the carved work of
<PB N="70" REF="012626_0069_0F8B8F53E008D610"/>
the houses of God, with axes and hammers; or take up the eightieth psalm for our lamentations.</P>
<P N="4">4. It was a joy unto us, to see and read, a book which the reverend president of our college lately published, un∣der the tittle of 'The order of the gospel professed and practised by the churches of Christ in <HI>New-England</HI>:' A book most highly needful, and useful, and seasonable; a most elaborate and well composed work, and well suited unto those two worthy designs; 1st. the maintaining the congregational-church-discipline; and 2dly, the main∣taining the sweet spirit of charity and communion towards reforming presbyterians, who are our united brethren. But we must here withal testify, that in that worthy book, there is nothing obtruded upon the churches, but what they who were here, capable of observing what was done sixty years ago, do know to have been professed and prac∣tised in the churches of <HI>New-England</HI>; (except in one or two) then and ever since, until of late, some who were not then born, have suggested otherwise. Yea, tis well known, that the churches then publickly maintained those princi∣ples, in several judicious discourses, which were never con∣futed by any men whatever, unto this present time. And we do therefore most heartily commend that book, of the order of the gospel, unto the perusal and acceptance of the churches of the Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. It was one of the songs (as the jewish masters tell us) in the seat of the tabernacles, Blessed be our youth, which have not made our old men ashamed. But alas, we that are old men must confess ourselves ashamed, when we see after what manner some of our youth, have expressed and behaved themselves, and with what scoffs they have assault∣ed the order of the gospel, in some things lately pub∣lished, and scattered about the country: which have been so far from answering the arguments brought for our church order, that they have been by the wonderful pro∣vidence of Christ, made useful to establish the minds of serious christians, in those very points, which they see so weakly and so rudely opposed. We have taught our children in the catechism, called milk for babes, that there is to be a covenant of God in the churches, wherein they give up themselves, first unto the Lord to be his people, and then to the elders and brethren of the churches to set forward the worship of God, and mutual edification. And
<PB N="71" REF="012626_0070_0F8B8F540EC111B0"/>
it cannot but be grievous unto us, as well as unto all seri∣ous christians, for my children of <HI>New-England,</HI> scorn∣fully to vomit up their milk with scoffs upon that and other sacred actions in our churches, too horrible to be repeated.</P>
<P>If they take from us, one of the songs among the anci∣ent Jews, they would however leave us room for one of the sighs uttered by a rabbi among them; the worst fruit which we eat in our youth, excelled the best which we now eat in our old age, for in our days the world is changed.</P>
<P N="6">6. Concerning all sinful attempts to overturn the or∣der of the gospel, hitherto upheld in the churches of New-England, and to spoil that glorious work of God, which we have seen him doing, with a series of remarkable pro∣vidences, in erecting such congregational churches in these ends of the earth; we would now therefore bear our testimony, that they are doubtless displeasing to our Lord Jesus Christ, who walks in the midst of these golden can∣dlesticks, and they will prove bitterness in the latter end.</P>
<P>And this we declare with the more concern upon our minds, because of an observation, so plain, that he that runs may read it.</P>
<P>It is too observable, that the power of godliness, is ex∣ceedingly decaying and expiring in the country; and one great point in the decay of the power of godliness, is men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> growing weary of the congregational church-discipline, which is evidently calculated to maintain it.</P>
<P>If that church-discipline were more thoroughly and vigorously kept alive, even by those that make profession of it, it might be hoped, that the Lord would sanctify it, for the revival of all godliness in the land.</P>
<P>But if this church-discipline come to be given up, we think it our duty, to leave this warning with the churches, that probably the apostacy will not stop there: For the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame spirit that will dispose the next generation to change their way, in one point, will dispose them to more, and more changes (even in doctrine and worship as well as in manners) until it may be feared, the candlestick will quickly be removed out of its place.</P>
<P N="7">7. We do therefore humbly propose it, unto all the churches, as a great expedient, for the preservation of our church-state, that more prayer (even in whole days of pray∣er
<PB N="72" REF="012626_0071_0F8B8F54C61EE8E8"/>
set apart for that end) with other appointed means, may be used in the churches to obtain from the Lord, the out pourings of the spirit of grace on the rising generation. If so rich a blessing were obtained, (and our heavenly fa∣ther will give his holy spirit unto them that ask it) and if the rising generation might be a praying, pious, devout and regenerate generation, there will not be such danger as now there is, of their easily giving away the precious legacy which their fathers (now beholding the face of the Lord Jesus Christ in glory,) left unto them, or of their doting upon innovations fatal to the order of the gospel among us.</P>
<P N="8">8. Now as aged Joseph said, I die, and God will surely visit you: even so, we the unworthy servants of the Lord, whose age bids us every day look for death, and our call to that world, where to be is by far the best of all, do con∣clude with our prayers unto the Lord for these holy churches, that he would surely visit them, and grant much of his gracious presence and spirit in the midst of them; and raise up from time to time, those who may be happy in∣struments of bringing down the hearts of the parents into the children. The Lord bless these his churches, and keep them stedfast, both in the faith and in the order of the gos∣pel, and be with them, as he was with their fathers, and never leave them nor forsake them.</P>

<P>THAT our testimony to the old principles of New-England, may be the more distinctly appre∣hended, we recommend unto consideration, three Pages in the life of Mr. John Cotton, written by his grand∣son, Mr. Cotton Mather. p. 33, 34, 35.</P>
<P>"Now that the world may know, the first principles of New-England, it must be known, that until the plat∣form
<PB N="73" REF="012626_0072_0F8B8F5874D63EC0"/>
of church-discipline, published by a Synod in the year 1648, next unto the Bible, which was the professed, no perpetual, and only directory of these churches, they had platform of their church government, more exact than their famous John Cotton's well known book of the keys; which book, endeavors to lay out, the just lines and bounds, of all church power, and so defines the matter; that as in the state, there is a dispersion of powers into several hands, which are to concur into all acts of common con∣cernment; from whence arises the healthy constitution of a common-wealth: In like sort, he assigns the powers in the church, unto several subjects, wherein the united light of scripture, and of nature, have placed them with a very satisfactory distribution.'</P>
<P>"He asserts, That a presbyterated society of the faith∣ful, hath within itself, a compleat power of self-reforma∣tion, or if you will, of self-preservation; and may within itself, manage its own choices of officers, and censures, of delinquents. Now a special statute-law of our Lord, having excepted women and children, from enjoying any part of this power, he finds only elders and brethren to be the constituent members, who may act in such a sacred corporation; the elders he finds the first subject entrusted with government; the brethren endowed with privilege, in so much that though the elders are to rule the church, and without them there can be no elections, admissions, or excommunications, and they have a negative upon the acts of the fraternity, as well as 'tis they only that have the power of authoritative preaching and administring the sacraments: Yet the brethren have such a liberty that without their consent, nothing of common concernment may be imposed upon them. Nevertheless, because parti∣cular churches of elders and brethren may abuse their powers, with manifold miscarriages, he asserts the neces∣sary communion of churches in Synods, who have authori∣ty to determine, declare and enjoin, such things as may rectify the male-administrations, of any disorders, dissenti∣ons and confusions of the congregations which fall un∣der their cognizance. But still so as to leave unto the particular churches themselves, the formal acts, which are to be done pursuant unto the advice of the council; upon
<PB N="74" REF="012626_0073_0F8B8F58A17CD488"/>
the scandalous and obstinate refusal whereof, the council may determine to withdraw communion from them, as from those who will not be counselled, against a notorious mismanagement of the jurisdiction which the Lord Jesus Christ has given them. This was the design of that judi∣cious treatise, wherein was contained the substance of our church discipline; and whereof we have one remarkable thing to relate as we go along. That great person who afterwards proved one of the greatest scholars, divines and writers in this age, then under prejudices of conversation, set himself to write a confutation of this very treatise, of the keys; but having made a considerable progress in his undertaking, such was the strength of this unanswera∣ble book, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stead of confuting it, it conquered him; and this book of the keys, was happily so blessed of God for the conveyance of congregational principles into the now opened mind of this learned man, that he not only wrote in defence of Mr. Cotton, but also exposed himself to more than a little sorrow and labour all his days, for the maintaining of those principles. Upon which occasion the words of the Doctor (Owen, in his review of the true nature of schism) are, this way of impartial examining all things by the word, and laying aside all prejudicate respect unto persons, or present traditions, is a course that I would admonish all to beware of, who would avoid the danger of being made (what they call) independants. Having said thus much, of that book, all that we shall add con∣cerning it, is, That the eminent Mr. Rutherford him∣self, in his treatise entitled, a survey of the spiritual anti∣christ, has these words, Mr. Cotton in his treatise of the keys of the kingdom of heaven, is well sound in our way; if he had given some more power to assemblies, and in some lesser points."</P>

<HEAD>QUESTION AND PROPOSALS.</HEAD>
<P>QUESTION.</P>
<P>WHAT further steps are to be taken, that the councils may have due constitution and efficacy in supporting, preserving and well ordering the interest of the churches in the country?</P>
<P N="1">1st part, it was proposed,</P>
<P N="1">1st, That the ministers of the country form themselves into associations, that may meet at proper times to con∣sider such things as may properly lie before them, relate∣ing to their own faithfulness towards each other, and the common interest of the churches; and that each of those associations hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a moderator for a certain time, who shall continue till another be chosen. who may call them toge∣ther upon emergencies.</P>
<P>In these associations,</P>
<P N="2">2dly, That questions and cases of importance, either provided by themselves, or by others presented unto them, should be upon due deliberation answered.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, That advice be taken by the associated pastors from time to time, e'er they proceed to any action in their particular churches, which be likely to produce any im∣broilments. That the associated pastors do carefully and lovingly treat each other with that watchfulness which may be of universal advantage; and that if any minister be ac∣cused to the association whereto he belongs, of scandal or heresy, the matter shall be there examined, and if the asso∣ciated ministers find just accusation for it, they shall direct to the calling of the council, by whom such an offender is to be proceeded against.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, That the candidates of the ministry undergo a due trial by some one or other of the associations, concern∣ing their qualifications for the evangelical ministry; and that no particular pastor or congregation employ any one in occasional preaching who has not been recommended by a testimonial under the hands of some association.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, That they should together be consulted by be∣reaved churches, to recommend to them such persons as
<PB N="78" REF="012626_0077_0F8B8F5B8EFDC4C0"/>
may be fit to be employed amongst them for present sup∣ply, from whom they may in due time proceed to chuse a pastor.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, That hereunto may be referred the direction of proceeding in any of their particular churches, about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he convening of councils that shall be thought necessary, for the welfare of the churches.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, That the several associations in the country, main∣tain a due correspondence with one another, that so the state of religion may be the better known and secured in all the churches, and particularly it is thought necessary to the well-being of these churches, that all the associations of the country meet together by their respective delegates once in a year.</P>
<P N="8">8thly, And finally, That ministers disposed to associate, endeavour in the most efficacious manner they can, to prevail with such ministers as unreasonably neglect such meetings with their brethren in their proper associations, that they would not expose themselves to the inconveni∣encies that such neglects cannot but be attended withal.</P>
<P>Second part, It is proposed,</P>
<P N="1">1st. That these associated pastors, with a proper num∣ber of delegates from their several churches, be formed into a standing or stated council, which shall consult, ad∣vise and determine all affairs that shall be proper matter for the consideration of an ecclesiastical council within their respective limits, except always, the cases are such as the associated pastors judge more convenient to fall under the cognizance of some other council.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, That to this end these associated pastors, with their respecti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> churches, shall consociate and combine according to wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has been by the synods of these churches recommended, that they act as consociated churches in all holy watchfulness and helpfulness towards each other; and that each church choose and depute one or more to at∣tend their pastor, as members of the council in their stated sessions, or occasionally, as emergencies shall call for.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, That these messengers from the several consociated churches shall be chosen once a year at the least.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, It is propounded, as that which from our begin∣ning has been recommended, that the churches thus con∣sociated for these purposes, have a stated time to meet in their council, and once in a year seems little enough, that
<PB N="79" REF="012626_0078_0F8B8F5DC6CD0B08"/>
they may enquire into the condition of the churches, and advise such things as may be for the advantage of our holy religion. But the more particular time is best left to the determination of each respective association.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, That the associations shall direct when there is occasion for this council to convene, on any emergency, and shall direct whether the whole, or only a certain num∣ber of these consociated pastors and churches shall con∣vene on such occasions.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, It appears agreable to the present condition of our churches, and from our beginnings acknowledged, that no act of the councils are to be reckoned as concluded and decisive, for which there has not been the concurrence of the major part of the pastors therein concerned.</P>
<P N="7">7thly, The determinations of the councils thus provi∣ded, for the necessities of the churches are to be looked upon as final and decisive, except agrieved churches and pastors, have weighty reasons to the contrary, in which cases there should be provision for a further hearing; and it seems proper that the council convened on this occasion, should consist of such pastors as may be more for number than the former, and they should be such, as shall be di∣rected to, and convened for this purpose by the ministers of an association, near to that whereto these of the former council belonged, unto which the agrieved should accord∣ingly apply themselves, and in this way expect a final issue?</P>
<P N="8">8thly, If a particular church will not be reclaimed by council from such gross disorders as plainly hurt the com∣mon interest of christianity, and are not meer tolerable differences in opinion, but are plain sins against the com∣mand and kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, the council is to declare that church no longer fit for communion with the churches of the faithful; and the churches represented in the council, are to approve, confirm and ratify the sen∣tence, and withdraw from the communion of the church that would not be healed: Nevertheless, if any members of the disorderly church, do not justify their disorders, but suitably testify against them, these are still to be received to the wonted communion by the churches; and if after due waiting, the church be not recovered, they may (upon advice) be actually taken in as members of some other church in the vicinity.</P>

<HEAD>THE EPISTLE DEDICATORY. To the Fraternity of the Churches in the <HI>New-England</HI> Colonies.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Truly honorable, and beloved in Christ,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not from any disrespect, or for want of honor to the reverend eldership and pastors of your several com∣munities, that I apply myself more immediately and thus abruptly to your selves in this dedication. But for that it seems most agreable with my present provence. The privileges of the fraternity being so peculiarly the theme and subject of my pains, I esteem it very proper to introduce my following essays, with a few words of advice more directly to yourselves if you may be thence moved and encouraged to assist for the support of Christ's and your own interests. I desire to be without offence to any, and pray that all such worthy persons, wise and faithful pastors in these churches (who are as much obliged by their office to stand by and defend the established interest and rights of them as I am, and far more capable) will interpret my whole action in the most favorable sense. And tho' I have not with the noble <HI>Cortius</HI> leapt into a chasm made in the forum; yet I have ventured to step into the gap, to keep the breach, till better hands come up, for the service of
<PB N="81" REF="012626_0080_0F8B8F5E86E409C0"/>
my country, and in defence of their sacred liberties; so that I hope many of you will come in with a new supply and recruit of courage and argument, when and where mine fails; and for the present I presume none of you will be offended, tho' I do thus immediately address the churches over which you preside, with the following prin∣ciples of their interest and duty wrapped up in each other.</P>
<P>Then, <HI>Honorable Brethren!</HI></P>
<P N="1">1st. In general, my advice is to you, that in good or∣der, and with all gracefulness which becomes wise men, you will with zeal, courage and faithfulness, stand in the defence of, and maintain your church liberties; God certainly obliges you to do it, with all the discretion and bravery of spirit, which becomes free men, in withstand∣ing vassalage or a servile state, Gal. 5.1, 13. Stand fast therefore in the liberties, wherewith Christ has made us free, and be not intangled again with the yoke of bon∣dage: The plea is as forcible against a christian, as a Jeweish Thraldom. For brethren, ye have been called unto liberty. I must acknowledge I have no particular prejudice against any of the governments of christian pro∣testant churches in the world, so as to defraud or dispossess any of them of heaven; or monopolize so great a royalty to our own; but yet I am of this opinion, considering the just title of the crown, the churches, the people, the capa∣city of soil and climate together, that the constitution and way of New-England churches cannot be mended by ex∣change.</P>
<P>Briefly, To instance in the civil part, or interest of the crown, I think it very easy to evince, by the precepts both of religion and policy, that the parliament (that wise and august council of the nation) could not have invented an establishment in church order, more for the service of the imperial crown of the British empire than our present constitution, especially in such a country and climate as this is.</P>
<P>I shall not now any ways enter upon the question, but only give just a short hint as to the revenue. Our pre∣sent constitution does indeed, somewhat more than sip; it takes an honest healthful draught at natures fountains, but leaves the flowing streams for empire to sit at, till filled with satiety.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="012626_0081_0F8B8F5FB4A6A728"/>The ecclesiasticks in some kingdoms in Europe are ready not only to chide with crowned heads, but to take them by the throat, and wring out of their hands, if not almost a moiety, yet a vast share of the golden fleeces that should supply the public treasuries, and cloath the nakedness of the kingdoms, and the people have no more wit but to justify and defend them in their claims and oppressions, and that till they themselves (in great numbers) are as thin and ragged as penury itself; for by their rules of adjustment, when the church hath gotten an unconsciona∣ble share, then the crown or subject must be almost starved; for there is not left a sufficient and plentiful supply for both.</P>
<P>But now our New-England constitution is very fair-mannered; for when its sits down to the stalled ox (made ready) it carves temperately and (without much defacing) leaves the whole to the empire to make its armies and navies, with the rest of its needful and unwearied servants welcome. That in loyalty to your prince, and for the support of the royal revenue, you may justly preserve your freedoms.</P>
<P>Let us also consider the best good of a whole people.</P>
<P>It is most certain, true grace is the one thing needful, and the main concern for the improvement of the powers both of prince, noble and peasant, and tho' grace be of that nature that it will grow (after a fashion and in some sort of soil) almost under any government; yet it is most agreable with laws of piety and wisdom (for the good of all in general) to chuse and secure that constitution and form of government that is most agreable, and which most naturally breeds it, and in greatest plenty.</P>
<P>By the suffrage of our nation, that government which sensibly clogs tyranny, and preserves the subject free from slavery, under the ambition of men of great fortune and trust, is the only government in the state to advance mens temporal happiness; and we in this country honor the resolve in civil affairs, and also affirm (upon great expe∣rience) that such a constitution in church government is (also) the only way to advance grace and mans eternal happiness; and we are the more ratifyed in our opinion, for that the experiment has on the other hand been tried, with a witness, in almost all kingdoms of the christian world, and that first, by disseising the fraternity of all in∣terest
<PB N="83" REF="012626_0082_0F8B8F602BF4D2A8"/>
in church government, only they have had the liberty to be governed with a hook in their noise (like wild cat∣tle in a string) by the mercy and pleasures of their drivers; but as for any share in the exercise of government, they have had no more, than the horses in the royal stables, for that their spiritual owners having seized all the keys of church power, they profess no dividend shall be made, and also they themselves being uncontrolable by any, and un∣accountable to any, unless it be to Christ himself, as they pretend: Though I believe, thousands of them never ex∣pect to meet with him, nor think that he ever will audit any accompts of theirs.</P>
<P>But however, for the comfort and glory of the present life, the whole government of the spiritual kingdom, in all its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inches, and with its immense profits, has been estab∣lished theirs. But this sort of discipline, hath sunk great part of the christian world, as many times over, as ages have past, since it hath been installed universal rector, and where it hath kept absolute possession of the throne.</P>
<P>And must the waves and present currents sit and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ft these churches, towards those rocks and shipwrecks, whilst we have such good hands and pilots an board? God for∣bid!</P>
<P>Therefore let these churches and the noble fraternity of them, stand their ground, keep fast hold of what you have got, Rev. 3.11. Hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</P>
<P>Hold your hold brethren! <HI>Et validis incumbite Remis,</HI> pull up well upon your oars, you have a rich cargo, and I hope we shall escape shipwreck; for according to the latest observation, if we are not within sight, yet we are not far from harbour; and though the noise of great breakers which we hear, imports hazard, yet I hope day-light, and good piloting will secure all.</P>
<P>More particularly I ask your patience with liberty (still for your service) to make the few following distinct peti∣tions.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="petition">
<HEAD>I. PETITION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honorable brethren!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT you would know what you are, and who you are, in the more ample and heroic sense of your state!</P>
<P>It is certainly very agreable with grace, for the upright,
<PB N="84" REF="012626_0083_0F8B8F625E052670"/>
sometimes to shift ideas, and change such as are mournful, for those which bear a bright aspect in their condition; otherways they may rob God of the glory of the best part of his grace and bounty, and disinable their own strength, for some of the most important services they are called to in the world; therefore Nehemiah plucks up his courage, and says, "Should such a man as I flee?" As tho' he should say, he knew himself owner of too many great en∣dowments and instruments, to be so little as to run for it, or be dreaded with such an alarm, Neh. 6.11, 12.</P>
<P>So brethren, imagine yourselves to be something more than ordinary; for really you be so; and that as you are a gospel combination, and collectively considered.</P>
<P>What! the best men of our country who form our courts, and command our armies, that make the figure and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the true lustre (by their great wisdom and real accomplish∣ments) in all great shews and appearances: Must all these be made null, or buried in a miosis (as is frequently en∣acted by ambition) for the fake of some inferior members in a fraternity? which is as much as to say, in state affairs, because coblers stalls or orange sellers baskets, afford no states-men, ergo, none to be found; or because that in many great counties there may chance to be an hundred knaves, and twice the number of fools, ergo, there be no <HI>legales homines,</HI> lawful men, fit for juries; no men fit for burgesses or knights of the shire, to be found to make parliament men? and so the kingdom must needs loose all its ancient righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s by default. And whether or no such ob∣servations as these, that are so very conclusive, as you see, may stand for better law and logic in the churches than in the empire?</P>
<P>But if of equal force in each constitution, then▪ whether this is not the way to inter and bury the glory of the em∣pire and churches in their own rubbish, whilst we incapa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itate the heroes of both by an argument a <HI>minoriad ma∣jus,</HI> viz. by infering the insufficiency of the great and wise because of the mean and base mingled in the same commu∣nities.</P>

<P>Many of you know the stories (possibly better than I can recite them) which tell us, what ship loads of blood and treasure those civil things have cost the English world; and how near they still lie to Englishmens hearts. And many of you being immediate successors, cannot but be very sensible what these New-England liberties have cost your progenitors, some of them having buried their estates, and all of them their bones in these foundations, and left you now in possession, that if you should put contempt up∣on their adventures, their courage, wisdom, zeal and self denial, by under-prizing these inestimable infranchizments, and slight them as though they were now to be indorst by your own hands with Hezekiah's Nehustan, God may then put you to learn the worth of them at that school where they learnt it; and I am sure you will pay dear for your tutoring if it comes to that.</P>

<P>IT is certain they are very great articles in the reasons of your well being, Mat. 5.13, 14. They make all things more savory, and to go down with a better relish; yea, they alter tradgedies and comedies into a more grateful entertainment. What is all the glory in the world without the gospel purely dispens'd, and its most refined influence? These are the lights of the world, and carry the lanthorn aloft in the dark night of your travels, thro' the tempestuous ocean of a miserable life, to direct all to a safe landing at last.</P>
<P>Indeed, I must acknowledge, your ministers, when sound and faithful, are to be accounted and esteemed amongst the best of your friends, tho' when corrupt and prejudiced, the worst of your enemies.</P>
<P>I think the devil himself, and the world of his accom∣plices, can't do you the damage, they may upon a revolt. That I beg you will be curious and careful of your in∣terest embarked and deposited there.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Furnish your churches with ruling elders!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE nature of the office is not only agreable with your frame, and exacted by your principles, but in∣deed carries safety and protection in it to your li∣berties: such trustees are not liable to corruption as other officers, in that you do as it were transmit and intrust them with your very principles of self-preservation, which are of that nature as never to alter their sentiments, unless it be in the dissolution of the subject, when all falls together. The office seems a creation, where your just and regular sympathies, and antipathies center by the laws of nature; that what you love, they love; what you hate, they hate; and being <HI>ex officio,</HI> of the standing watch and guard, they will peculiarly personate your selves upon every nota∣ble crisis, and naturally caring for your affairs, will, like wakeful sentinels curiously and with courage guard your liberties. Let churches which are numerous and fuller of eminent gifts, lead the way, and then excite and provoke their sister churches to such love and good works for the advance of the common cause. There are without doubt, in these churches, many private members, worthy persons, suitably qualified for this office, who (like some edge-tools heedle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly left to rust out in oblivion) lie hid, yet, when found, and put to use, will prove themselves truely emi∣nent.</P>
<P>Let Christ's churches seek amongst their neglected hoards; for they are, without doubt, church by church, far richer than they make for; there are, indeed, com∣plaints of great poverty, and of a dearth and scarcity of suitable men. But I presume it is done with great injustice; and complaints of this nature in these churches, are but the complaints of servants that are full fed; and relieve no case by complaining, but rather reflect dishonour upon their
<PB N="87" REF="012626_0086_0F8B8F67CC5AC010"/>
good master, who hath bought all and bestow'd enough, and also incur blame to themselves for not improving those talents for the advance of his exchequer, which they them∣selves have wrapt up in a napkin, and that in this case, by too much symbolizing with the carnal and politic men of the world, who to humour some by-ends (under the mas∣querade of indigent persons) make themselves very poor, tho' God has given them great riches, Prov. 13.7. This is a true (tho' a serious affirmation) that in our constitu∣tion and principles, there is as plain a precept, if not as great a reason for this officer, as for any other in our churches; and yet, as to matter of fact, we find it to be <HI>rara avis in terra,</HI> like a black swan in the meadow; and tho' the whole species is not quite rooted out, yet it is grown very rare to find one individual.</P>
<P>Now the fault must be some-where, and I am satisfied, our poverty is least to blame.</P>
<P>That some body or another must needs be culpable, on the account of this great omission, may I without offence issue out, search and inquest, to know who is to blame, up∣on this failure, whether brethren, or public officers, or whole churches?</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="group">
<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Private Brethren.</HEAD>
<P>MAY not the blame be laid in some cases and in some churches, upon some very capable christian gentlemen, who tho' not incumbred (for the pub∣lic) with any other incoherent service, yet are possibly too shy of this trust, when offered to them? It must needs be acknowledged, the office is almost perfectly a piece of mor∣tification and self denial; there is no provision in it to feed ambition, or feast any other lust; all is full of watching and painfulness, and the reward and wages quite out of sight. But however in such examples, whether persons so qualified, and so called, ought not to comply, or themselves bear the blame.</P>
<P>The terms of Christ's kingdom are very strict and rigorous, for the honor of his own crown, when our just titles are competitors, and he lays the conditions of our obedience, upon a great forfeiture, if we don't submit, when called to duty, Mat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. 10.37, 39.</P>

<HEAD><HI>2.</HI> Public Officers.</HEAD>
<P>MAY not the ordained officers in some cases and in some churches, be taxed or blamed, for this great omission? Such as out of timidity and dis∣trust, jealous ruling elders, least they should instead of col∣leagues prove corrivals in the exercise of their own trust and authority, for being men not of such deep learning, yet may prove so fortifyed with friends, and so popular, as that they may be capable to over-top men of greater learning, and wiser principles of conduct in all administra∣tions.</P>
<P>Now if any of Christ's churches, are vacated of this officer, by such jealousies as these, or of the like nature, can the officers be without blame? and if so, then whe∣ther the first born son may not justly imprecate future bar∣renness on his own mothers womb, for fear lest he should be supplanted of the inheritance, by the next son or brother born of the same ventre?</P>
<P N="2">2dly, Such officers as may plead their own particular conscience and perswasion, against the office, as being of a doubtful original, or of an uncertain institution, and therefore make bold to over rule our plain precept for it and the church submits: whether is there not a great blame here?</P>
<P>It seems apparent by all rules of order and government, that this is too too sovereign in the one, and too servile and careless in the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her.</P>
<P>For that no officer's particular conscience must be a rule to govern any particular church, contrary to the churches own law, or rule of establishment; For if it be, then the churches must have as many distinct charters, and differ∣ing books of canons, as their pastors have differing con∣sciences; which is a plain in-let to all sorts of con∣fusion.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, Such officers who plead the custom of the churches, and so make the illegal omissions of some, a sanctuary for the same fault in others; but whether this plea from cus∣tom will hold officers exempt from blame, when weighed in a just ballance? Custom is justly allowed a great con∣queror in the world, it subdues whole kingdoms to its empire, and all men submit and adhere to its demands and dictates, as to an oracle? But then it must be custom that is honorable, laudable, and uninterrupted, otherways
<PB N="89" REF="012626_0088_0F8B8F691E69ACD0"/>
a custom which continually crosses a plain precept is very culpable, and contracts a long series of guilt, and may ex∣pect to be pursued with a tedious train of sad consequences, altho' it should with much presumption wipe its mouth and say, I am innocent. Therefore custom is no plea in this case, but rather renders all who depend upon it, to be reduced to a desperate posture in their thoughts and argu∣ments; for tho' there is a customary omission, that hath prevailed in the churches to a sad degree, as to this office, yet the omission has all along crossed a precept, and has been confronted by the custom of other churches in the land, who have attended their duty; so that those churches who have maintained the practice, have kept lawful posses∣sion of the right, and the title being matter of record, and founded in law, there remains no shelter here from custom for delinquents.</P>
<P N="4">4. Whether those officers are justifiable, who honor the office, yet do honestly and uprightly think that the nar∣row extent of territory may (as to many churches) serve as a supersede as to the office? For what need of so many great commissions in so small bodies? But whether small churches have not great work belonging to them, sufficient to improve a full compleat set of officers, and possibly, all little enough to do the work well, if the nature and extent of it be rightly considered and faithfully managed; for who is sufficient for these things?</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="group">
<HEAD><HI>3.</HI> The churches.</HEAD>
<P>WHETHER the churches, as incorporate bodies, are free from blame when they don't regularly endeavour to compleat themselves in all offices, and prosecute their claim to this with effect?</P>
<P>The ruling elders are the churches privilege, and a very great right, on which their well-being and stability does much depend, and the great omission in the country has probably brought things to that posture of fickleness as we now find them at? Then whether the churches can be exempt from blame, when they suffer such vacancies to con∣tinue, when it is in the power of their hands to remedy it?</P>
<P>Here indeed is a great question commencing, viz.</P>
<P><HI>Question,</HI> Whether any church can possibly, and accord∣ing to rules of order, proceed to elect ruling elders, when
<PB N="90" REF="012626_0089_0F8B8F69CE719DD8"/>
other of their officers in actual rule and trust, shall refuse to call and guide the church in the choice?</P>
<P>I shall indeed transgress the bounds of my own inten∣tions, and the civility of an epistle, if I should now under∣take a full and compleat answer to this question.</P>
<P>I shall therefore at present only just indix the principal titles or heads for answer, by pointing briefly at the duties of officers, and the prerogatives of the churches in the case.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is most apparent through the whole ministry of the world (unless in absolute monarchies) that it is the duty of all public officers, to minister according to the plain rules of the public state, and not by their own fancy or wills, and so in this case, the chief ruling officer or officers (then in being) in point of conduct are obliged to lead the church in their opperation, according to the churches plain and settled principles, and not reluct be∣cause their own perswasions do otherwise incline them; It is now plainly too late for any officer to pretend conscience against established rules: This objection should have been made before they had taken office. But now it is out of season, for they were elected and ordained to govern the church, not by their own thoughts, as the rule, but by the churches canon, and that by their own consent, when they took office. And moreover, this is most evident, that if such powers which belong to the inside of mens being, viz. their hearts, fancies, notions, judgments, imagina∣tions or consciences, call them by what names you please, or let the owners freely fix the titles (the odds is not great,) now if these are to be the rule of churches, then pastors and ruling officers have (in their degree) as abso∣lute a dominion over the churches, as the great Turk has over his bashaws, and other vassals.</P>
<P>But I hope none here will claim this dominion. And if not, then let pastors and teachers do their duty in point of conduct (if the churches are not remiss in theirs) and this great vacancy may be soon supplied, and there is also a relief for officers, if their just prerogatives are any ways toucht by the traverse.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, To confine the discourse to this present example, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shorten terms, for brevity's sake, it must be granted that any particular officer sensible of his duty, that shall undertake to gratify and lead the church, in the election
<PB N="91" REF="012626_0090_0F8B8F6A9C410458"/>
and choice, &amp;c. This makes the case very easy in point of conduct; yea, tho' other officers in the same church, if there be any, should either oppose or not act. For that any one ruling officer in a church, where they may be many of the same nature, he himself is vertually the whole college of officers in any office-act that he performs with∣out them. As in civil affairs, a particular executor so far sustains the whole executorship, as that he can make a va∣lid act in that ministry, though many others are joined with him in the same testament, and yet don't nor won't act with him, in this or that affair, tho' confirmed in their trust; which principal is founded in the nature of a joint tenancy in general, and in a joint trust in particular, held by many equals.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, The case is very difficult when the standing officers join as one man, and will not guide the church in these elections referred to, &amp;c. And I must needs say, I fear here has been the great bar to this office.</P>
<P>We may from interest, as well as duty, rationally sup∣pose the inclinations of the churches, and the desires of many of them have been made known by repeated and honorable solicitations therein, saying to Archipus, fulfil thy ministry, Cor. 4.17. And we may also affirm, the principle is plain, the office is acknowledged, at home and abroad to be of divine original. But however this is cer∣tain it is a formal establishment by these churches, and not now to be disputed. Yet the officers pretend, they see no reason to give way to the churches desire or demands, neither will they conduct in this case, though their duty does oblige, that so the church may be compleated in its officers; no! they are pleased by acts of a superintending power, to lock the church door, and turn the key against this office, and no pleas or perswasions can alter their reso∣lutions. But hereby the officers do plainly abdicate their office, by changing the acts of a limited trust, bounded by precept into what is meerly arbitrary; so in a degree, they break up the relation between themselves and the church, and by such an essential error, so contrary to the churches charter, and their own commission they forfeit all at once, tho' lenity and mercy may favor them with a long life; yet in the eye of justice they are dead men, if not in na∣ture, yet in law, and upon their OBSTINACY may justly be DEGRADED, therefore in such a case when it comes to
<PB N="92" REF="012626_0091_0F8B8F6B607C3538"/>
that extremity, the churches may and ought to call in council, and proceed in their work and duty for their own well being, after the manner of an inorganic church, platform, chap. 10. And this I need not stand to describe, our platform, the laws of the province, and the practice of the churches in other cases, and vacancies will do it.</P>
<P>Then whether these congregational churches thro' these provinces may not justly reflect blame upon themselves, for too supine negligent a frame of spirit, towards so great an interest, and so noble an office, seeing they have such a share in government, and can fairly resque themselves and their own rights, by the power and principles of their own essence, when their other officers neglect duty?</P>

<P>It is very usual for many gentlemen in your coun∣try, landed men, and men of estates, every men to keep his law-book by him, as his bible, the bible for the solace of his mind, and the law-book for the safety of his estate, that upon any defamation of title, or other incroachments, when his lands and properties are in hazard, he may know whither to repair for his direction, and how to make his defence.

That there should be a kind of a penalty (if the hazard in such a defect be not punishment en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh) on such delinquents, as live members of Christ's visible king∣dom here, and yet live without the platform, the ecclesias∣tical political charter of these churches.</P>
<P>I must needs say, and I wish I could whisper it so low, that the eccho might never rebound to Gath or Askelon, and yet be distinctly heard through these churches, That I fear the impression of the platform is almost extinct, if not quite worn out in the country.

<P>WHETHER it may not be very proper for these churches, after so long an interval, to admit of this address, viz. That they will please to meet or represent themselves in a provincial or general synod?</P>
<P>That if there be any thing in our church government which may want emendation, that (as they say) it may be done, <HI>Secundum usum sarum,</HI> or regularly and according to the manner of these churches; or if there be any new forms, needful to be inserted, or whatever else may in a way of order be thought necessary for the advance of re∣ligion, it may be fairly decided for the service of the whole. And also, if it then shall be judged prudent, our princi∣ples for the seising, and trial of the more ungovernable, and stouter sort of delinquents and offenders, may be re∣vised, and somewhat enlarged, that so it may be made very easy for all particular churches, to make out processes against them, and that they shall find the churches fetters will hold them. That forever after all small juncto's of men, or particular persons, member or members of the churches (let their character be what it may be) shall be deterred from being so hardy and bold as to divulge their pernicious doctrines, and seditious sentiments, with such presumption, and such hopes of impunity, as some of late have done.</P>

<P>I have n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thing more at present to add by way of petition

to your selves, but only that you will please to take this poor piece of service in good part.</P>
<P>But tho' it be but as a little goats hair, or a badgers hide or two, or skins not well drest, yet it may be some way useful for the tabernacle. And tho' it won't shelter against storms of great shot, it may serve to cover and shield from some slighter arrows.</P>
<P>But let it be what it may be in every other mans opinion, it is in mine (as to design and intention) my love, honor and loyalty to my God, pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and country, for whose service I was born, according to the received maxim, <HI>Non soli nobis nati sumus.</HI> And here I pay one part of my debt to those great creditors in such species as I have; therefore I hope for pardon from, and acceptance with all of them.</P>
<P>My conclusion is with devoutest application to the su∣pream throne, that the almighty God will bless the great ANNE, our wise and protestant princess; New-England's royal nurse, and great benefactress, that she may live to see all the protestant churches thro' her vast empire, more virtuous and more united, and as they all meet and center with their differing perswasions, by their love and loyal actions in her person and government. Let her most ex∣cellent majesty, next to Christ, continue absolute in her empire over their hearts, and as she has made such a com∣pleat conquest, of all differing parties within her domini∣ons, by her wise and virtuous measures, and thereby won all the fame of rule and soverignity from her royal progeni∣tors, who could never so charm such mighty nations. Let her reign continue the exactest model for all courts in Europe! and when she is full repleat and satisfied with length of days, and the most glorious effects of a prosper∣ous reign, let God favor her lasting and flourishing name with an unperishing monument, on which justice shall be∣come obliged to inscribe this m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mento, viz. "Here lies in funeral pomp, the princess of the earth, the store-house of all enobling and princely perfections," That if all the monarchs on earth, have lost their excellencies, their <HI>arcana imperii,</HI> their state, wisdom, skill in government, and all sorts of heavenly, princely and heroick virtues; here they may be found lodged in this one unparralled MONARCH.</P>

of the province, and let it continue always in the hands of natives, and let our country, successively breed men of such merit, as shall always enamor imperial majesty, with their loyalty and worth; and that their true deserts may ever purchase for them such a high station, whilst they shall plainly out-weigh their rivals in the royal ballance. And let them be always patrons to these churches, as an acknowledgement to the crown of heaven, as the settled condition of tenure they hold by, and possess such royal demesness.</P>
<P>Let the great and good God of heaven and earth bless these churches, the beauty of the wilderness, and continue so noble a ministry as they now have, and prosper and re∣quite their faithful and unwearied labors, and let him con∣tinue the succession, and furnish the next set with greater accomplishments and virtue.</P>
<P>Let Christ Jesus, the great sheppard, who hath the care of the flocks in the wilderness, preserve inviolable, the inestimable privileges and liberties of these churches; and let them entail them, with all other civil and sacred rights and immunities which they now enjoy, as a sure estate of inheritance, to the last posterity of this people.

<HEAD>AN ANSWER To the foregoing PROPOSALS.</HEAD>
<P>THE nobleness of parentage, by the laws of honor, entails on posterity, (with other rights) a protection from all incivilities, but not from the austerer de∣mands of justice, when that is affronted and violated. Justice keeping the golden rule, <HI>Quo dat suum Cuique)</HI> ob∣serves

no other distinctions, than what it first makes in its distributions amongst the rich and poor, the noble and ig∣noble, it is no respecter of persons; for that it is superior to all men, and sits as a veiled empress, holding the bal∣lance to weigh out equal to each one according to the merits of the cause, and sees no man.</P>
<P>There being now under cognizance, such as are of hon∣orable families, and yet arrested and brought by due course of law to answer for high crimes, it must not be supposed rudeness in manners, though they be somewhat freely and rusty handled whilst the prosecution is held agreable with the impeachment and rule of justice. And as for myself, who am under commission from authority, to appear in defence of my country's sacred liberties: I can in my own justification, affirm, that I have no dishonorable inclinations, but carry a just mind, so as to condemn no man or thing, but upon plain evidence, nor to aggravate any plea beyond its just bounds.</P>
<P>Therefore tho' in the following pages there may be dis∣cerned, a great liberty in argument, with a mixture of satyrs, as tho' none but my inferiors were involved in the charge; yet ascribe it unto my love and veneration for so great an interest as I appear for, and not to any base intent of sinking the honor, or darkening the lustre of men. I neither desire nor design to hurt any man, no, not so much as an hair on his head, but I solely aim at ERROR, that is the butt I level for.</P>
<P>Thus having by this brief, but sincere apology, secured the honor of my intentions, if I am worthy of belief; I shall no longer interrupt the process, but shall nextly, draw up the indictment, upon which these proposals are to pass, and abide a trial.</P>
<P>And this I shall do in a form borrowed from sir Edward Cooke, the King's attorney, in the arraignment of sir Walter Rawleigh, in these words.</P>
<P>HERE is mischief, mischief in <HI>Summo Gradu</HI>; yea, exorbitant mischief. This is the charge I offer to make good against the proposals, at the bar of common reason; in order thereto, I shall proceed, and expect to produce sufficient evidence under two heads.</P>
<P N="1">1st. By a few preliminary queries.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="97" REF="012626_0096_0F8B8F6F43B2EA28"/>2dly, By a more critical examination of the proposals themselves.</P>
<P N="1">1. As introductory, and for the bringing in further evi∣dence against the criminal proposals, now upon their trial, I offer these following queries.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="query">
<HEAD>1st Query.</HEAD>
<P>Whether the churches in New-England are not fairly in possession of a form of government, by which they are dis∣tinguished from most of the reformed churches in the world, more than by their grace? and if so, (which no man that knows them will deny,) then it must be some superior power, or their own voluntary act, regularly ob∣tained, that must out or dispossess them. Did an equal claimer appear, yet long and quiet possession holds against a writ of ejectment, a very strong plea in the sessions, both of reason and law; according to that acknowledged maxim, <HI>in Aequali Jure, melior est Conditi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Possidentis,</HI> when two plead an equal right, he is in the best condition who is in possession; then it can be no less than a very indis∣putable right, and duly prosecuted with effect, that can dis∣possess these churches of their government.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="query">
<HEAD>2d Query.</HEAD>
<P>Whether length of time has discovered any essential error in the government of these churches?</P>
<P>And 1st, it has, or 2dly, it has not.</P>
<P N="1">1. If time has made any such discovery, yet the proposals have not been so fair as to detect it, or describe wherein, or in what respect. The great service these churches, with their government, have done, in subduing and beautifying a wilderness, bespeaks some considerable respect from all men, who value wisdom or piety; that it must needs seem a harsh piece of justice, without any formal trial for them to be driven from plenty, and sent to the doors of their own tenants, to beg for a booty, out of that estate which was once their own at least, by a seisin in fact, if not in law; for that the proposals kill, and take possession with far less ceremony or legal formalities, than Ahab did, in gaining the right of Naboth's vineyard; when as if there is any essential error in their frame or constitution, and that they have either ignorantly or treacherously assumed any peculiar prerogative which be¦longs
<PB N="98" REF="012626_0097_0F8B8F71B18323F0"/>
to Christ's throne, as king, that was never their due to possess (and so being considered as usurpers, are dead in law) yet notwithstanding it would not have offended against the laws of gratitude in sending them to their graves, to have put some more marks of honor upon them, by certain solemn and usual forms of trial in the prologue of their dissolution; for they have been certainly great and good servants to the public, that if they deserve to die, they ought to die under all the marks of honor which justice can allow of, at the least a grand sessions, a jury, and liberty to make plea in their own defence, and under the influence of royal council, should have been granted; unless they may be treated as conquerors, serve unfortu∣nate pirates, who when taken, are without form of law hung up at the yards-arm.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. But if no such discovery can be made, whether it is a wise and just thing for men to alter their government? The churches of Christ in this country, have been in pos∣session of this form of government; and it hath been established by certain legal and orderly familiarities, and universal consent; and has continued upwards of three∣score years. And as the poet says, <HI>Pervarios Casus Per Tot Discrimina Rarum Tendimus in Caelum,</HI> They have passed various changes, and great temptations, and yet to this day by this besome of discipline have been kept as clean swept, as any churches of God in the world; and any such embroilments as have lately happened in the churches, have been more the folly of administrators, in not keeping to the rules of government, than from any defect in the constitution. Then what reason have we to meditate a change? No, certainly; it will be more divine and agreable with the law of our religious gratitude, to join with the rev. Mr. Nicholas Noyse, in his doxology, or use of triumph and praise for the great mercies he recites in his election sermon, p. 79. says he, Thanks be to God and the king! our houses and our lands are our own, without every mans being at the cost of a charter; and yet we have the liberty of our religion, and the free exercise of it, without subscribing new articles of faith, worship or discipline; which is a great favor of God, if we have wisdom and grace to improve it rightly.</P>
<P><HI>Query,</HI> Whether the right improvement will be to alter the scheme of our government or discipline, seeing no bo∣dy
<PB N="99" REF="012626_0098_0F8B8F722A969680"/>
else will do it for us? No surely! But it will be more agreable, with both our policy and duty, to follow the good advice Mr. <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> leaves us in his golden-street, page 40, in these words, "Where we have a platform left us that is according to the word of our gracious Lord, and the pattern in the mount; we shall be great enemies to ourselves, if we do not keep to it."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="query">
<HEAD>3d Query.</HEAD>
<P>Whether it be not great boldness for any particular gentlemen to invade, null, alter or weaken so great a right and property, as is the government of these churches, with∣out their consent?</P>
<P>Government is the greatest blessing in the world, of a worldly nature; it is felony, cheaper by far to the loosers, to plunder men of their estate and wealth, nay, and of their lives too, then to dispoil them of government; for by the latter, you harrass and worry them in the world, with plagues and miseries, worse than death itself, that the basest is far better than no government; a churlish tyran∣ny, is better than an insolent anarchy, where men are without law, and all hail fellows, not well but badly met. And for men to alter or swap government, without all in∣terested parties are agreed, is a very bold intrusion.</P>
<P>That, yea, that government which is in any good mea∣sure formed, and does agree with the natural freedom of human beings, and is adjusted by the laws of wisdom and honor, and plainly, and fairly established; is too much of God in the world, and too great a royalty belonging to men, for any to play the knave or fool with.</P>
<P>And when a government hath done all things in the main well, and has reapt in a great stock of blessings, now to shuffle it out of place, is fickleness, and not policy; for a sensible series of blessings will always atone for some seeming defects in a constitution. Therefore when all Israel met at Ramah, in a general assembly, to alter their consular government, which had been crowned with signal blessings, they got ill will in the court of heaven for it, 1 Sam. 8.7.</P>
<P>The great success which attended, signified it to be a theocracy, and that it had more of God, than of man in it, which is an argument, <HI>(Caeteris Paribus)</HI> for all other governments, and so for this of New-England churches, which has been honored with great success, and many
<PB N="100" REF="012626_0099_0F8B8E5EC5948338"/>
blessings from its beginnings to this day; therefore well does Mr. Cotton Mather describe the subject and advise his country, in his late sermon on the street of gold, says he, (in a remarkable pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sage out of a letter) page 40. "Here is a temple built more glorious than Solomon's, not of dead stones, but living saints; which may tempt the greatest queen of Sheba to come and see, and allure even kings from far to come and worship in. Therefore, as to their government, (says he) sirs, do not spoil it, oh, destroy it not! there is a blessing in it."</P>

<HEAD>4th Query.</HEAD>
<P>Whether by comparing the proposals and our platform, we don't find them repugnant, and so contradictory, that if one stands, the other must fall?</P>
<P>And that we can as soon reconcile a republic with an absolute monarchy, or the best sort of free states with a politic tyranny, or at least with an oligarchy, where the chief end of government is the inriching and greatness of its ministers; and this we may do, when we have com∣pounded these proposals and our platform, so that as that faithful and noble friend to these churches, the famous and learned Increase Mather, D. D. in an appendix to his dissertation concern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng the sacrament, laments several plots conspiring the dissolution of these famous churches, in these words, viz. The bold attempts which have of late been made to unh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nge and overset the congregational churches in New-England, by decrying their holy covenant, &amp;c. We may here justly highten the complaint, and cry, <HI>Pro Dolor! hinc Lachrimae!</HI> Alas, alas! here's the grief! hence flows our tears! for here is a bold attempt indeed, not only to despoil the house of some particular piece of furniture, but to throw it quite out at windows; not only to take away some of its ornaments, but to blow up its foundations. For these bold attempts which that WORTHY complains of, seem now to be grown very ram∣pant; for here is in view a combination of workmen disaffected with the fashion of the old fabrick, who (in pre∣tence) design to repair, but in reality to ruin the whole frame. They appear (indeed) something in the manner of Nehemiah's men on the wall, Neh. 4.17. As it were with a trowel in one hand, with which they now and then put on a little untempered mortar, to plaister over a think or two, where the old work by length of time, is
<PB N="101" REF="012626_0100_0F8B8E60F1018070"/>
somewhat weather-beaten, to pacify the jealousies of the inhabitants, that they may think these builders (surely) are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending, and not ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing their old comfortable habita∣tion. But in reality, they have in the other hand a for∣midable maul, not as Nehemiah's weapon to defend, but to break down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he building; for they are all hands at work banging the platform in pieces, upon which the old fabrick is built. That may not the churches, and all their lovers sigh and complain, as once <HI>Cicero</HI> did, <HI>O Tempora! O Mores!</HI> who would have expected such times and such things from such men?</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="query">
<HEAD>5th Query.</HEAD>
<P>We must needs then enquire, from whence the proposals derive their force? Who gives them letters of attorney, or commission to sue these churches (by a <HI>Quo Warranto</HI>) out of possession of their government? To me (I must needs confess) the attempt is very daring; and I see no way of reconciliation, unless the scheme drawn in the proposals can be fairly sheltered under some more authentic and spe∣cious umbrage, than the bold dictates, tho' of the wisest of men, when they are pleased to set themselves up oracles for their country.</P>
<P>So I come,</P>
<P N="2">2. To the more critical examination of the proposals themselves, which I shall attend,</P>
<P N="1">1. More generally.</P>
<P N="2">2. More particularly, by taking a survey of them in their distinct sections.</P>
<P N="1">1. More generally, by enquiring into their original, and nature.</P>
<P N="1">1. By making a more exact inquest and search after their original; and in this debate, they forfeit their essence, unless they can derive their pedigree, either,</P>
<P N="1">1. From Gods immediate inspiration. Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. From ancient revelation. Or,</P>
<P N="3">3. From right reason, which is a ray of divine wisdom, instampt upon human nature. Or,</P>
<P N="4">4. From the platform of the churches, which is a system of government, collected by our ancestors out of several fountains, and principally from the scriptures. Now in pursuing this distribution, I shall diligently enquire, whe∣ther we can hear of their original under any of these heads.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="102" REF="012626_0101_0F8B8E611D1DD798"/>1. As to immediate inspiration, I must needs presume, these gentlemen will not dare to assert, that they are sent immediately from God with this message to the churches; they are too good and wise to pretend (with enthusiasts) to immediate vision, or a spirit of prophecy; both the mat∣ter and manner of their writing, sufficiently convinces, that these proposals are their own sentiments; they durst not put, a, Thus saith the Lord upon them; such an inscrip∣tion is too heavenly and royal for such coin; for both they and we know, according to, Deut. 30.12. It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may know it, and do it? There is no need to send messengers to that court, to learn by immediate and extraordinary information, ei∣ther laws of our duty or interest; for that God hath made all things sufficiently plain, by this time of day, either by scripture or reason, for the conduct and government of his churches; yea, of the subjects of his universal intellectual monarchy in this world.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to ancient revelation; holy scripture, that best, tho' not the biggest of books, is the saint's library, and the clergy-man's pandects, whence he takes the rules for the management of his trust: so that it is very amusing, that the bible should be forgotten in drawing up such schemes as these; as, tho' the usuage of the pope's conclave, which turns the bible out of doors for a wrangler, and gives the chief seat to tradition, &amp;c. were here in fashion. Indeed, I cannot but esteem them very unfortunate proposals, to be turned so naked into the world, as not to have the least tincture of scripture to guard them from contempt; no, not so much as a citation, that might admit of so much as a strained consequence in their defence. And so, tho' less prophane, yet they are also less politic than the most des∣perate of hereticks, who always bring their errors on the stage, guarded with scriptures, and craftily endeavour to make their citations look with such an aspect, as tho' they were encampt on their side. But here we have nothing for our faith to lean on, but so many austerer <HI>Ipse Dixits,</HI> as bitter pills of dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h for the churches to swallow, with∣out any of the confection of heaven, or the sweet manna sprinkled upon them; or else only so many naked human presumptions, as arrows or bolts, too rashly shot out against the sides of our churches, and no word of scripture
<PB N="103" REF="012626_0102_0F8B8E61F0F595A8"/>
to tip or feather them. Nay, it is very memorable, and I account fatal, and to be observed that God, that sacred title of the almighty, with which the holy scripture does so abound, is not once named (as I can find) in the whole treatise; as tho' the most sacred titles, as well as sections of that heavenly book, would move fears, and irritate jealousies, rather than pour down solace and comfort upon this undertaking. Therefore, in a word, the whole bible is thrown by as a sealed parchment, or as one that never prophecies good to such adventurers. Therefore these proposals being apprehended as sea rovers, and indicted upon the statute of piracy; and upon examination being found without the prince of princes colours, and yet do∣ing great mischief, in assaulting and wounding his churches and lawful subjects, on their honest occasion; being bound on a voyage to their own country, they can no ways in justice escape, but must pass under the sentence, and en∣dure the pains of death, for they are taken fighting with∣out commission.</P>
<P>3. As to REASON.</P>
<P><HI>Recta Ratio,</HI> Right reason, that great oracle in human affairs, is the soul of man so formed and endowed by crea∣tion, with a certain sagacity or acumen (in many particu∣lar examples, sharpened by the constitution of nature by grace and study) whereby mans intellect is enabled to take up (<HI>pro Medulo,</HI> or in a degree) the true idea or preception things agreable with, and according to their natures. So that if we bring these proposals under examination by the laws of reason; we must enquire, whether they are agrea∣ble with the nature and constitution of the churches, if they fully harmonize with their principles of essence, then they may be enroled for canons; but if they jar, and are plainly repugnant, we may then lawfully censure them, and pronounce them irrational. Whether these churches are constituted by scripture or reason, yea or no, that is not our question, but being of such a frame or constitution, as they now are, and always have been; all who pretend to support and preserve them, and yet take such measures, as will utterly overthrow and dissolve them, such repairers have apparently deserted the dictates and government of right reason.</P>
<P>And here we may collect an induction of some few hints of certain particulars for evidence; the platform asserts a
<PB N="104" REF="012626_0103_0F8B8E628F5D8478"/>
classes to be no gospel form of church order; the proposals say it is; or they abuse our credulity. The proposals or∣ders the association to have the first cognizance of church cases; our government says, no, it belongs to the juris∣diction of particular churches. The proposals gives power to the association to have the first cognizance of church cases; our government says, no, it belongs to the juris∣diction of particular churches. The proposals gives power to the association to limit elections, and to direct them; but our government says, no, it will not consent; the elec∣tion of officers is the prerogative of the churches, and they wont, as yet, part with it, &amp;c. So that when we can by the rules of grammar, resolve yea and nay, to be the same voice and word, then you may reconcile the proposals and the platform; that certainly whatever there be of religion, the method is apparently disagreable with common reason.</P>
<P>4. As to the PLATFORM.</P>
<P>I shall represent it by a kind of a short prosopopa, thus, viz. enquiring whether the proposals are reduced from this fountain, the platform with all its chapters, and with one joint consent, as plain as the tongue in their heads can utter it, say, that ever since it possest the government, so much as dream'd of them. It may say with destruction, (Job 28.22.) we have heard of the fame of these things, with our ears, but never imagined so much as a seminal virtue in our own being, for their procreation; but rather starts with the news of their approach, out of fear of its own dissolution, from their repugnant and formidable na∣ture. Therefore as in a grievous fright from surprize, cries out with <HI>Athaliah,</HI> treason, treason! And begs that zeal and conscience, those two sollicitors for the crown, will at this grand court of Oyer and Terminer, implead and pro∣secute them as traitors to the prince of peace, and felons to these churches, Christ's loyal subjects. So I come,</P>
<P N="2">2. To enquire into the nature of these proposals, by surveying their composition and properties.</P>
<P N="1">1st. Their composition.</P>
<P>They seem a conjunction of almost all the church govern∣ments in the world, and the least part is congregational. Indeed, at the first cast of the eye, the scheme seems to be the spectre or ghost of presbyterianism, or the government of the church by classes; yet if I don't mistake, in inten∣tion
<PB N="105" REF="012626_0104_0F8B8E6346802F40"/>
there is something considerable of prelacy in it, only the distinct courts of bishops, with the steeples of the churches, tythes, surplice, and other ornaments, do not shew them∣selves so visible, as to be discerned at the first look, yet with a micrescope you may easily discern them really to be there in <HI>Embrio, et in Rerum natura</HI>; For this is a known maxim, <HI>Quod necessario Subintellegitur non deest.</HI> What is necessarily understood, or lies hid in the intention of a design, is really there, by a just interpretation; therefore these proposals which dare revolt so far at a step, as these have done, must needs understand no less in their aim, than an enobling government for clergy-men, which our princes and parliaments have adorned the churches with. This seems rational, that those which never stick at robbing the churches of such an immense treasure, as the proposals carry off, will never stand. Shall we! shall we! at the offer of a bishoprick, which is a barrony with all its rights, and royal appurtenances.</P>
<P>There is also something in it, which smells very strong of the infallible chair, to assume the power of making rules, to engross all principles of process, the right of election, the last appeal, the negative vote, and all superintending power in matters ecclesiastic, as the prerogatives of clergy∣men, distinct from all other estates, and ministers in go∣vernment; or thus, for the clergy to monopolize both the legislative and executive part of canon law, is but a few steps from the chair of universal pestilence, and by the lad∣der here set up, clergymen may, if they please, clamber thus high; for when they are invested with what is in these proposals provided and intended for them, who then can controul them, but the Almighty himself? as was said of those daring men, Gen. 11.6. And now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do; for who can now with-hold from them infallibility, or stop the direful and definitive sentence? Who can limit their power, or shorten their arm in their executions? Their bulls can now upon any affront, bellow and thunder out a thousand terrible curses, and the poor affrighted and invassal'd laity, both princes and subjects (being here as in the grave, put under one and the same to pick) must fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>feit their salvation, if they don't tamely submit, and obediently become their executioners; for that it is now
<PB N="106" REF="012626_0105_0F8B8E6433A052E8"/>
evident, that all power is if not really given, yet formerly stolen, and in intent bequeathed to them.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly. Their properties.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1st Property, is Disorder. Order is both the beauty and safety of the universe; take away the decorum where∣by the whole hangs together, the great frame of nature is unpin'd, and drops piece from piece; and out of a beauti∣ful structure we have a chaos. These proposals are there∣fore very mischievous, if not in matter, yet in the manner of production; they are full of disorder, being things born out of due time, their conception is without counte∣nance, from the rule of order. Indeed, there is no statute to be found that will justify the first coitus of the parents, neither will any allow their social life; that the birth must bear the attender, of being both begotten and born, out of lawful wedlock, and so in point of honor fall under the censure of the Levitical law, and must be kept back from promotion; for, Deut. 32. "A bastard shall not enter into the congregation."</P>
<P>That to pass all other remarks, if we are under mistake in the assertions; I then demand and enquire, where is that lawful authority, which published legal banes, with the consent of all the interested persons, and the regular consummation of the match? If any rule can be found to shelter and honor the conception and birth, let it be pro∣duced; and it escaping other felonies with life, this scandal shall be taken off, but otherwise it must remain as a bar to the tenth generation.</P>
<P>The 2d Property, is Usurpation. The proposals ap∣parently usurp the church prerogatives. It has been assert∣ed, and it is true, these churches have been settled upon the platform of their own government for upwards of sixty years; they have often revised and re-inforc'd the establish∣ment, both as the principles of their consociation and union in general, and the form of government, for every church in particular.—Then for these proposals without licence to assume a legislation, and form a government so repugnant to their own, can be no less than usurping a dominion over them, contrary to the rule, 1. Pet. 5.3. neither as being lords over God's heritage. Lesser acts against empire, hath cost many a bold man his he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; What! for a particular knot or juncto of gentle∣men to make so bold with a settled government, as to pick
<PB N="107" REF="012626_0106_0F8B8E66F6FAE3E0"/>
out all the enobling royalties, liberties and enfranchize∣ments in it, and sacrifice them to their own ambition! It is enough to put mankind into an uproar.</P>
<P>It is fresh in memory, that when some of our English princes (and one would think, if any men may, they may be allowed to aspire, yet when they) have presumed on less things than these proposals reach after, in gratifying their aim at an absolute monarchy, when as they have not dared to lay out with such freedom, a new form of govern∣ment, with a wide mouth, gaping to devour the English liberties, (as these proposals do the churches,) but only with much secrecy, covin and policy, they have by some more clandestine measures, been intruding upon the anci∣ent liberties of the English nation. Every one knows what direful convulsions this has bred in the bowels of the kingdom. And may it not serve to enliven this plea? To invite all such who are with <HI>Plato,</HI> owners of a great genius at inventing new, or modelling old government, to try their skill in altering the English monarchy, and see how it will be probated. That is, suppose you should ven∣ture to interdict the royal assent, or convert the present monarch into a duke of <HI>Venice,</HI> or dissolve the lords in parliament or (rather in harmony with this scheme) turn the burgesses and knights of the shires (as a sort of men not fit for politics in parliament) out of doors? And whe∣ther our sovereign, the peerage, or subjects of English li∣berties would take it well? And whether christian men may make bolder with the established government of Christ's churches, than with that which belongs to civil affairs? In honor to the <HI>New-England</HI> churches, and with venera∣tion for the English monarchy, I dare assert, that there is in the constitution of our church government, more of the English civil government in it, and it has a better com∣plexion to suit the true English spirit, than is in the En∣glish church, or any other, both as to the legislative and executive part of government. Indeed, considering how things are at home in church and state, I have been some∣times ready to query, why the nation should be so ena∣moured with their civil, and yet so careless and regardless of their gospel liberties, so as to trust their consciences, with their clergy, more immediately, and yet wont venture their estates with their learned judges, without the privi∣lege and mediation of juries; as though they were more
<PB N="108" REF="012626_0107_0F8B8E6723621B00"/>
careful and wise in securing their estates than their souls, and valued one far more than the other. But I shall go on with the comparison.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the legislation; our <HI>New-England</HI> convocati∣on admits, and the government does profess the fraternity as necessary to the being of all synodical assemblies, that as far as legislation spiritual, is left to men, and as they have a great treasure, viz. their salvation embarked, so they have a great interest in the management of it; and herein they agree with the English caution and wisdom, in the modes of civil government of the empire; for the com∣mons are one great estate in the civil legislation; and they have a great power in the management of that great trust.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to administration, or the executive part of go∣vernment, our <HI>New-England</HI> government grants a juridical power to the frat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ity, and makes them proper judges in all ecclesiastical cases and administrations, on persons cog∣nizable, or that must pass a trial juridice; which is agrea∣ble with the constitution, nature and practice of the civil government of the empire; for under the prosecutions of law, no English subject in life, limb or estate, must be past upon, but by the judgment of his PEERS; yea, in all pleas of the crown, such confidence has the government put in the loyalty and discretion of the commons, that our English juries are stated arbitrators, and umpires between our prince and his subjects. Yea such a dependance has the whole nation in keeping these liberties in their own hands, that they reckon the commons in parliament, and juries in the common wealth, to be the great pillars of En∣glish honor and liberties, and they esteem them as ram∣parts built by the wisdom of our ancestors to defend us from tyranny and slavery.</P>
<P>That considering the affinity in these two constitutions, one would be ready to query, whether the heroic true En∣glish spirit is not parent to both? Or whether they are not equal debtors to the gospel, for their original? The improvement of this comparison is briefly this; suppose some of the great ministers of state should venture to sweep away all those civil enfranchizements which are En∣glish-mens birth-right, and set up an arbitrary power, with a prete<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of doing justice and judgment in the king∣dom, by more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and expedite measures, whether they might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> seized? And whether the statutes
<PB N="109" REF="012626_0108_0F8B8E67C765FF48"/>
would not be chains strong enough to hold them, as trai∣tors, to a well formed government, and then laid fast by a mittimus for great usurpers? And whether the plea will not hold in just proportions, on the other side of the com∣parison?</P>
<P N="3">3d Property, Riotous. The nature of a riot may (in part) be thus described; it is an unlawful assembly of more than three met in one place, to do an unlawful act, as vio∣lently breaking down of walls, and pulling up of hedges, and wrongfully entering into other mens rights and pos∣sessions, and that in affray and terror of the people. In managing this plea, I shall only desire that the illegality of the assembly which formed these proposals, with the ob∣jects and things they intend, and the ancient boundaries which they plainly invade, together with the fearful ap∣prehensions that many good and sober people in the vici∣nage have concerning the enterprize, may be critically examined; and I doubt not but when we obtain the suff∣rage of this honorable court, it will determine, the implead∣ed criminals are of a riotous nature, and so the indictment will stand more valid against them.</P>
<P N="4">4th Property, Sacriligious, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">5th Property, Rebellious.</P>
<P>It grieves me to utter the epithits agreable with the nature of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se proposals; yet they must blame their own nature, but not my justice, if I give them but their due; for I find them in the breach of a royal statute; yea, I think of a penal law. This is plain, they take away the liberties, privileges, discipline and government of these churches, all which are established to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m by the law; and that not only by their own canons, but by the laws of this province, as by a royal Magna Charta, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z. in an act for the settlement and support of the ministers, page 3, in these words, "The respective churches in the several towns within this province, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll at all times hereafter use, exercise and enjoy all their privileges and freedoms, re∣specting divine worship, church order and discipline; and shall be encouraged in the peaceable and regular profession and practice thereof."</P>
<P>This act (as one says on the great charter of English li∣berties)deserves to be written in letters of gold, and hung up in all our houses of God'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> public worship, to signali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the zeal (in presence of God, angels and men) of the au∣thority
<PB N="110" REF="012626_0109_0F8B8E6BE12F4CE0"/>
of the throne and empire, for the establishing of these churches, and Christ's interest in them. Now, con∣sidering that the power, policy, and grace of the English crown, should, thus lock up the churches treasure for them, and set such a centinal, with the flaming sword of justice in its hand, to dread and awe intruders, it must needs be a very bold action, (if it been't plump rebellion) to attempt or design such a sequesteration or imbezelment as the pro∣posals DO.</P>
<P N="6">6th Property, Unfaithfulness, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="7">7th Property, Ingratitude.</P>
<P>For the stewards of great families, when advanced to honor, and a profitable trust, by the free election and grace of noble-men, when their lords are laid down to rest, and sleep too securely, or are gone out of town, with this presumption, that their estate is secure, it being put under the care of loyal trustees, and thankful servants; now for such trustees and stewards, upon such opportunities to pocket up, or load away the riches of the family, and set up for themselves, and leave the proprietors beggars, whom they found in wealth and plenty, is both infidelity and in∣gratitude. Now let the churches be pluck't and deplum'd as the proposals in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end, and they are after possessing a fair estate, become bankrupts: And let those stewards that are guilty, answer for the robbery; for my part, I will have no share in it.</P>
<P N="8">8th Property, Impolicy.</P>
<P>And I am sure there is great store of this in these propo∣sals; I shall instance but in two particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. In timing the challenge that is here made, to brave a rich and powerful enemy at so great a distance, and invite him by sound of trumpet to a pitch'd battle, when surprize and ambushments might be laid, and do the work with the expence but of a tenth part of the blood which this may cost. This is not agreable with the art of war; Achito∣phel would have put a derision upon such measures. Ja∣cob's sons when taking a bloody design in hand, first con∣trived to stupify and blunt the courage of their enemies, and then came upon them by surprize, e'er they could arm in their own defence, (though it does not justify their cruel∣ty, yet it magnifies their subtilty) for thereby they bro't their design about; whenas if they had gone a more blunt
<PB N="111" REF="012626_0110_0F8B8E6CCA949288"/>
and daring way to work, Simon and Levi had not been half a breakfast for the Hivites. Gen. 34.25.</P>
<P>So here, had the churches been convened, and no noise made of this design, they possibly (tho' their treasures are fortified by right, and so in safety, and their troops more, ten to one, than their enemies) yet by ambushments or sur∣prize, they might have chanced to have been coakered or conquered out of all, by being flattered, over-awed, or o∣ver-argued, into a surrender or submission; but we may now rationally hope the alarm will rouze the whole camp, and each squadron will rebound it to the next with a <HI>hinc Proximas Urit Ucalogon</HI>; and so the plot may upon a de∣feat, blame its own bad conduct, more than its fortune.</P>
<P N="2">2. The design itself (<HI>Quo ad fluem Executionis</HI>) let it come to birth, as is designed or desired, and the very hea∣vens would either frown upon, or laugh at it for its folly: If we examine the climate of the country, the degrees of latitude, and the several stars that chiefly govern, there is no good policy in the design; so that, methinks the uni∣versal frame of nature cries it down for a <HI>Non compos mentis</HI>; for there are no such great creatures as are here conceived, can fare in hard cold countries as the <HI>Camelion</HI> does in warm, there must be a very great hoard to support them; and nature does honestly confess, she cannot answer the bills of fare, which belong to their table, and do her duty to the royal exchequer; and this must be maintained, or all breaks to pieces.</P>
<P>Again, let it be considered, whether it been't great intel∣lectual weakness, or want of policy, for one generation to contrive needless loads for the next, especially when they may get as well to heaven, without carrying such packs a∣long the road? It has been universally the humor of man∣kind, according to the laws of nations and nature, when roused by the regular dictates of self-love, to endeavor that every following generation might be more lightsome, free, noble and happy than that which did immediately preceed.</P>
<P>They say the <HI>Chinees</HI> dig clay and use it not, but leave it heapt, or in pits, mellowing for the next age. Every prudent man builds his house for duration. The prince enlarges and betters his dominions. The peasant sweats to advance his estate, and then each leaves all in greater triumph to their heirs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kentish Yeomantry</HI> are had in honor to this day, for
<PB N="112" REF="012626_0111_0F8B8E6D0BEDF480"/>
not stooping to the conqueror, till they had conditioned, and thereby secured their fair estates of lands in fee and free-holds for ever from all forfeiture by felony, according to their country proverb,
<Q><L>The father to the bough,</L>
<L>The son to the plough.</L></Q></P>
<P>Such is the merciful fore-sight of mankind, and his cha∣ritable care and fore-cast for such as shall follow, tho' they may never be seen or known by their wise progenitors.</P>
<P>But here is plainly a conspiracy very heterogenious to such judicious acts of human providence; a design plainly, if not perfectly to enslave, yet to bring posterity into a needless vassalage and thraldom.</P>
<P>This is an acknowledged verity amongst wise statists, That that monarch who has the command of the seas, can at his pleasure command any maritime country. And so, those men who have the command and empire of the con∣science of mankind, can command their estates, and indeed whatsoever else is grateful to them.</P>
<P>Then, whereabouts are we in our politics, when we have delivered up the royalties that are challenged? And in what a weak capacity shall we leave posterity in? Nay, these virtuoso's themselves seem to be hardened with the ostrich against their own natural issue, unless the thing would chance to spring up as quick as Jonas's goard, and hang as full of pearls and diamonds, as the seas, and rocks of <HI>India,</HI> and they themselves shall have the first shake▪ and fill all their coffers, with this harvest, or at least, that they are assured that they can and shall entail their offices as securely as their lands, upon their own children; as was the order of priesthood, and the fashion of the house of Levi. But alas! These modes are all worn out and made null; and such mens sons, as we are now treating of, fall in with the multitude, and must carry their equal share of the common load; that should the project prevail, un∣der their management, (might they but look up out of their graves in about half an age) they may complain in elegy, after the manner of <HI>Virgil</HI> with his, <HI>Sic vos non vo∣bis hos ego versiculos feci, Tubit alter Honorem.</HI> These ver∣ses I made, but another man carries away the honor. So these gentlemen might e'en say, we have contrived to grea∣ten the clergy, and with bees have filled a rich hive; and built a fair nest well feathered, but our posterity we see, is
<PB N="113" REF="012626_0112_0F8B8E6F3B8B83D8"/>
never the warmer, nor will th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y lick their fingers of it; and not only so, but are the men that must make up the tenth sheaf, and deliver the tenth cock, calf and lamb un∣to others out of poor demesnes. And also it may justly beget a mournful remembrance in posterity of their pa∣rents, and make them often look wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a sad countenance upon their fathers graves, not because they are dead, but because they had not ended their days sooner, viz. before this scheme (so oppressive and cruel to their small freeholds) had taken effect under their management.</P>
<P N="2">2. We come now according to engagement, to take a survey of the proposals in their distinct sections.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the ministers of the country form themselves into associations, that may meet at proper times to consider such things as may properly lie before them.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> There is no doubt or question to be made, but that the ministers and pastors of Christ's churches may meet in greater or lesser numbers; for they are masters of themselves, and no more accountable how they spend their time, than other men are; but to meet at certain times &amp; places, as political incorporate bodies, or in the form of classes, for the exercise and management of government, this must be determined by some precept issued from a le∣gislative power; and without this, such who give the ad∣vice, and exhibit the call, are very dispotic and arbitrary; and those who attend it, are servile in their submission; for there is no man in his right wits will take this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was <HI>Aaron,</HI> Heb. 5.4. The offer or invitation, bids defiance to our constitution; for our platform denies the classical state of the church under Christ, chap. 2. sect. 5. Therefore this is a daring article, in the criminals case; and as it strikes at the vitals of our government, it must in the TRIAL bear weight accordingly.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> And that each of these associations have a mode∣rator for a certain time, who shall continue till ano∣ther be chosen, who may call them together upon emer∣gencies.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="012626_0113_0F8B8E6FA6522E40"/><HI>Answer.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1st. What limits shall be assigned for the precincts of every distinct association? Or may we conclude the best model is to follow the civil distinctions made by the coun∣ties? And if so, then the pastors of each classes are scat∣tered through a territory of twenty or thirty miles square, more or less, and then it must needs follow, that the mo∣derator, to discharge his duty, provide messengers to cite all these distinct gentlemen upon any emergency; but the great difficulty is, what kind of messenger it must be, whe∣ther king <HI>Solomon</HI>'s tell-tale bird may be trusted with mat∣ters of such importance? Or, whether the moderator must re-imburse him? Or, must he go on his own cost, contra∣ry to equity in that law? 1 Cor. 9.7. Who goeth to warfare on his own charge? It is apparently an error, that care hath not been taken to find horse and man, and bating-places for both on this journey, otherwise for a le∣gislative power to prescribe chargeable offices, and leave them destitute of a temporal support, they must of necessi∣ty die to save charges, or turn mendicants, or hope in their travel to meet with the prophet's juniper-tree; all which are as disagreeing with good reason as the proposal it self.</P>
<P N="2">2. The moderator has an unlimited power during the prorogation of the assembly. (1.) He must judge of emergencies, that he may summon the members; and being left vested with such a prerogative, if after he has made his citation, he recants, he can then countermand his own order, though the gentlemen should be all mount∣ed, and ready to move. (2.) If there chance to be an emergency of common concernment, if he finds his own favorites involved in the guilt and danger; he then gives no notice, but stifles the business, and so cheats the com∣pany. (3.) And upon any disgust, it is now at his mercy to null the whole frame; for he must be in place till another be chosen; and how will they get together, if he will not give the word? Unless they are creators of themselves the second time, as they were the first. That to institute such charitable designs without a fund, and tie such trust and dominion on the shoulders of men after such a lax and careless manner, and leave them at such loose ends, as easily to make fools of men; for my own part, I slight such methods in government.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<P>THAT questions and cases of importance, either pro∣vided by themselves, or by others presented unto them, should be upon due deliberation answered.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> I suppose there is no intent to erect a young or mock-royal society, or that all questions and cases of experimental philosophy be admitted; if it should be so, I think this some-what touches upon the prerogative of the crown, and may be called in question, under the head of high misdemeanors, if not <HI>Pro Crimini Iesae Majestatis</HI>; but howsoever, though there be no distinction made, yet we will take it in a more charitable sense, and that the proposal (in intent) is wholly confined to church matters; and if so, we must then inquire, how many deep questions can be found in our country, grown mouldy with the <HI>Gibe∣onites</HI> bread, for want of wise handling? Or can we find any such heaps of gordian knots, as <HI>Opprobria Theologo∣rum</HI>? The reproach of divines laid up against this consisto∣ry meet, to untie them, that we must needs molest our old settlements for their solution? For my own part, I cannot comprehend the proposal, unless it be a plot to introduce the enemy, that is in the reer, that is, by making shew of great illuminations, we may be dazeled with their lustre, and thereby the more easily taken in the snare here laid. But however, to conclude, as the wise says of things more physical or artificial, <HI>Eccle.</HI> 1. So I may say of questions and cases, there are none new under the sun. They have been all well spoken to; every learned casuist, is full of them, &amp;c. And <HI>Ames</HI> and <HI>Turrettinus,</HI> &amp;c. for a few shil∣lings will do more in a month, for an inquisitive mind, than this proposal can do in the tedious apprenticeship of many years, then certainly, computing by rules of propor∣tion, we can no ways expect that the clear gains should countervail the great damage we shall sustain by swapping governments upon these terms.</P>

<P>THAT advice be taken by the associated pastors, from time to time, e'er they proceed to any action in their particular churches, which may be likely to produce any embroilments.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> This is very dishonorable, and also a very unreasonable incroachment upon the officers and govern∣ment of the churches.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="012626_0115_0F8B8E70D33271A8"/>It divests the officers of the free exercise of that office-authority, which God's word and our platform places in them; read Platform, chap. 10. sect. 8, 9. These are to feed and rule the churches, they are to receive the accusations, and prepare them for the churches hearing. This section of the platform fixes both process and judica∣ture in particular pastors and churches, without any limi∣tation? But the proposal allows no process to be opened. till letters of licence be obtained, from the classes. But why may not all other persons in office be thus fettered, as well as pastors of churches? Are these the only students of wisdom and righteousness, that are strangers to the nature of actions, to the rule and application of it? All other of∣ficers, in trust and commission, who are wise and loyal, ex∣ecute the hardest articles in their employ; and who may say to them, why do ye so? Our judges never stick to hang a man, so long as their commissions and the law will bear them out, and they themselves are left, to be inter∣preters of both. And that this proposal is a sanctuary for officers against a storm: alas! the most that we can make of it, is a covering of fig-leaves, and may serve for a harbour to cowards and fools, but not for men of spirit and conduct. The dream of an embroilment, can never counter-poize duty; if men are trusted with duty, they must consult that, and not events. If men are placed at helm, to steer in all weather that blows, they must not be afraid of the waves, or a wet coat.</P>
<P>It is certain, it was no dimunition for Timothy to carry St. Paul's cloak and parchments from Troas, 2 Tim. 4.13. Yet for particular pastors in the management of church-government to do little more than to carry the copies and parchments of associations about the country, and hang up th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir decrees on the pillars of churches, according to the order of the proposal can never entitle them to such a tri∣bute of love and honor as the scripture does assign them, as the purchase of their great merits, 1 Tim. 3.5. 1 Thes. 5.12, 13. Such bequestments as these from the fountain of honor, must signify more than some such poor low ser∣vile business (no ways too high for Jereboam's priest to execute) as is laid out in the proposal, but especially if they have but some one head man to conduct and draw up the conclusion.</P>

<P N="3">3dly. But if you intend honestly, only the watch of one brother over another, as is the duty of all christian people, one towards another, then I cannot understand the sense of the word, as applicable here, with the least good meaning or syntax imaginable.</P>
<P N="1">1st. For though there is a design of new-modelling of men, and bringing clergy-men into another form of socie∣ty; yet there is no intent divulged, that they shall co-ha∣bit, bed and board together upon certain charters, as the Friars or Benedictines, in their royal monastries. Indeed, the section might have been ingrost with the first canons of the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> or St. <HI>Bennets</HI> laws, when first entering upon their monastic life; but it no ways agrees with this constitution.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. For, as for the occasional meeting of men, emi∣nently sober and virtuous, what business can be supposed for a watch, for about the space of twenty-four, or forty-eight hours in such examples? Very bad men will hold out longer than so, in a good behavior, under the awe of but some one venerable person, or a grave <HI>Cato.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. And when these eminent persons, members of the association, are dispersed to their own proper precinct, the proposal surely does not intend they shall follow the chargeable example of princes, who usually keep spies in each others courts, to inform themselves, how things are managed there; for its plain, the charge and expence in managing such a watch as this, will reduce all clergy-men to this dilemma, that they must either vote up the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry,
<PB N="118" REF="012626_0117_0F8B8E72F41BDBE8"/>
or vote down the method. But then the thing itself is not fair; for it would seem as tho' they watched more for the halting than the help of each other. But as for the proposal, a riddle I found it, and a riddle I leave it.</P>
<P><HI>Sect.</HI> And that if any minister be accused to the associ∣ation where he belongs, of scandal or heresy, the matter shall be there examined, and if the associated ministers find just occasion for it, they shall direct a calling of the council, by which such an offender is to be proceeded a∣gainst.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> I must boldly and freely enquire, whether this is an honest answer to the question propounded in the head of the proposals? Or whether in reality this is the support∣ing, preserving &amp; well-ordering the interest of the churches there meant? If you mean as you speak, I am sure there is either so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dishonesty or misunderstanding between the que∣stion and the answer; for it cant possibly be otherwise, un∣less the parts of speech are lately become a chaos, and all words are not only of the doubtful gender, but such unrea∣sonable epiceens, that not only both kinds, but both con∣traries are signified in them; or thus, that to build, plant, repair, pluck up, pull down and demolish, are all now be∣come convertable terms; for take away these high prero∣gatives from the churches, and you take away their being. These and such like royalties, are their <HI>Formalis ratio,</HI> or the formal cause (<HI>per Quam Res est id quod est</HI>) by which they are, what they are; and this will be very evident, if we do but read a short lecture on the churches essence ana∣tomized, or let their essential and constituent parts and powers be viewed in the history, and philosophy of their own beings, and we shall quickly discern your mistake; for that end read platform, chap. 5. sect. 2. Ordinary church power, viz. of privilege belongs to the brotherhood, and may be acted or exercised immediately by themselves. And more directly to the case in hand, look into chap. 10. sect. 6. Where there we read▪ If an elder offend incorrigi∣bly, the matter so requiring, as the church had power to call him to office, so they have power, according to order (the council of other churches, where it may be had, di∣recting thereto) to remove him from his office; and being now but a member, in case he add contumacy to his sin, the church that had power to receive him into their fellow∣ship,
<PB N="119" REF="012626_0118_0F8B8E73200C6438"/>
hath also the same power to cast him out, that they have concerning any other members.</P>
<P>Now herein we find an essential article in the govern∣ment and being of these churches, that they have and hold such jurisdiction over their own members; that the highest tribunal ecclesiastical on earth, is there; and that their own delinquent private members, and publick officers are triable only there, and there they must receive the definitive sentence, and abide the execution of it.</P>
<P>And if so, then I shall make bold to revive my query again, viz. Whether the proposal is either honorable, civil or honest, thus to tumble down at one blow, this high seat of authority? and to break open our prison doors▪ and loose the fetters of our great offenders? and at the best to take them out of our hands, and make their mittimus to foreign pastors to do justice upon them, and yet in the mean time to profess, they are doing us no other injuries but only repairing and mending our churches? Again, whether this is fair, and work-man-like amongst honest men.</P>
<P>But to make a stop here, I must remind you, that this head is not to be passed over slightly; for this is the one thing in the essence of our churches, it is their peculiar in∣franchizement and birth-right, and we may not sell it with Esau, at a cheap market; if we do, we undo ourselves; for indeed you must know, here lies the marring or mak∣ing of our churches; here is laid up their strength, and here hangs the pick-lock of their treasure; for by this key stolen, or wrinched out of their hands, the churches of Christ in the world, have been exposed and plundered, for more than a thousand years, and many of them have no∣thing at this day left them, comparatively, but a poor, starved, shabbid implicit faith, and a dull, fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnal blunt and blind obedience, that a man would scarcely give a groat for both of them. In a word, the usurpations of the pastors, since the great revolt, having unshackled one another, and broke loose from the restrictions they are justly subjected to, under the churches power of privilege, has utterly undone the christian world, from this root of bitterness and pride, from this seed sprung up, the man of sin, as we have it in an anomulous author, viz. the Elethe∣rians, page 4. In words to this purpose, "Then a lit∣tle priest had an opportunity to establish himself, then
<PB N="120" REF="012626_0119_0F8B8E73C45B0550"/>
there appeared in the temple of God that anti-christ, who calls himself the vicar of Christ." And then the same author going on to discover the original of this monstrous birth; he says thus, "Anti-christ was conceived in, by, and from certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffectations of ecclesiastical preheminen∣cies." As though he should say, the first spawn or embryo of that insolent Hector, or aspiring Nimrod, (who first robbed the laiety of their christian liberties, and then hunted down the potentates of the world, and brought them as a rich spoil, into his habitation of violence) took its commencement from this principle, viz. from the cler∣gies assuming to themselves this ecclesiastical preheminence, viz. first their obtaining an exemption from the cogni∣zance of the churches, for their crimes, and then in posses∣sing themselves of the sole and absolute jurisdiction (by a dispotic government) over the churches themselves.</P>
<P>But however things have been hitherto, I shall no longer uphold the debate, by revising the abuses that have been done to the christian churches by an ambitious clergy, in the ages past, which might more amply be discovered, by tracing the foot-steps of the great apostacy: But I shall end the whole dispute on this head, by drawing up a pro∣test, and denying the jurisdiction of the court, erected and opened by the proposals, as being perfectly disagreeing and repugnant to our former settlements, and present con∣stitution.</P>

<P><HI>Quest.</HI> Whether a trial by association is preferable to the old custom of the churches, in promoting their candi∣dates for the ministry to public trust?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> In the reply, I shall, first, consider our candidates under trial; as to their qualification; and (secondly) im∣plead the proposal on a just prejudice from the corruption of the clergy.</P>
<P N="1">1st. We may consider our candidates under trial, as to their qualifications, (1.) As to their human learning; and here we absolutely object against the trial of associations, as bootless, useless and perilous, both to them and to us.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the association, it is no diminution, or trespass upon the laws of honor or truth to affirm, "That the settled ministry in general (with some reasonable exception) is less expert in grammar and points of philosophy, than our learned children are at the degree of junior batchellors," and that from dis-use, proved from all experience, <HI>Nam usus Promotos facit</HI>; and also for the sake of more divine studies, which croud out those first ideas a great pace, ac∣cording to that observation, on a learned memory, <HI>Imago Imaginem Expellit, Aliis{que} Aliae Succedunt,</HI> for as one wave thrusts out another, so one idea another. Therefore it is a pity to expose such venerable persons to the hazard in this service, least when they become posers of others, they should be posed themselves. I do remember an odd story when I was at college; it was retained as a reproach on a very divine and worthy person; tho' he was bred in England a good scholar, and also had been a school-master, and had taught the grammar in his young times, but yet having laid by in a great measure, the use of such things, for the sake of more valuable and heavenly speculations, being at the solstice, and one of the corporation, ventured
<PB N="122" REF="012626_0121_0F8B8E794BF54F50"/>
in the hall, to propose this question, to one of the commen∣cers.</P>
<Q>Quot sunt Caela!</Q>
<P>To which the lad with sausiness enough, yet with a gram∣matical niceness, only answered,
<Q><L>Sed Audi.</L>

<P>That Prisians head will in likelihood be kept bleeding from one generation to another, by reason of some unlucky strokes, if this form be established, and that to the great detriment of those who strike the blows.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. To US. Accademical learning we profess to be a very essential accomplishment in the gospel ministry. It is introduced by the ordinary blessing of God upon human endeavours, to supply the place of the cloven tongues, and those other miraculous gifts and endowments of mind, imprest upon Christ's ambassadors, whereby fisher-men commence <HI>(per Saltum)</HI> doctors of divinity; and in an in∣stant were stock'd with such principles of religion, reason, and philosophy, that they were capable to dispute with Athens it self, and baffle the greatest wits she could pro∣duce, in defence, and for the advancement of Christ's kingdom, Act 17.18.</P>
<P>Thus it is very reasonable that the churches should be well assured of the sufficiency of the learning of those persons, e'er they presume on the ministry; yet there is a fairer way in view, fuller of honor and safety, than what the proposal directs to.</P>
<P>Our accademy is the store-house of learning, and this all mankind will assent to. When you have lost the company of the muses, there they are found in their freeholds, where they hold the ballance of honor amongst the learned. This is the place, if not of the goddess Minerva or Apollo, yet the Bethel or temple of God himself; the God of wisdom, where he, as chief architect, with his under workmen, form wise and learned men, and where you may have them wrought off at first-hand: Then certainly here we are to secure our credulity and confidence in this affair; here we are to know whether they be of the right stamp, yea or no.</P>
<P>That of all men living, the best and most infallible stan∣dard for the philosophical accomplishments of our candi∣dates, is the judgment of the honorable president, and no∣ble
<PB N="123" REF="012626_0122_0F8B8E79FB1B1A80"/>
fellows of our famous col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ege; for this I am sure must needs stand for a verity, that the judgment of a real honest and skilful artificer (keeping close to his shop) concerning the nature and qualities of an edge tool which he hath wrought, and hammered on his own anvil, out of its first rude matter, must certainly excel him that hath been long from the trade, that only takes it, turns and tries the edge slightly, or has but a transient view of it: so that hence we may fairly infer, that (as to human learning) <HI>Harvard's Commendamus</HI> is most valuable and sufficient, and justly supplants these testimonials.</P>
<P N="2">2. With respect to the more evangelical qualifications of the gospel ministry, we shall be ready to honor the suf∣ficiency of the associates, yet must take liberty to object a few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Suppose we, that the trial is made <HI>per Contionem ad Clerum,</HI> by preaching a sermon, in audience of the associ∣ation, and I think this is the way proposed and generally agreed upon, as the square or rule most agreable with gunter, to take the dimensions, length and breadth of our candidates by.</P>
<P>Reply 1. What can a sermon do at deciding this ques∣tion? for that the most sensible and valuable, who are usually most humble and tender, are liable by this stupen∣dious examination, to be baffled by their own timerity, and quite dash'd out of countenance by their own fear. Alas! upon their first entrance upon the stage, to appear in so august and awful a prese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, this must needs dis∣animate and put their thoughts into a raffle, as having in their affrighted minds the resemblance of their going into the Spanish inquisition, rather then dwelling amongst the softer measures of the gospel? Luther himself, (that un∣parallell'd instance of spirit and magnanimity, as I re∣member of his life) hardly ever got over something of a panick fear attending him, through the course of his minis∣try; and indeed men of the quickest senses are most liable to these paroxisms. Then surely to put our tyros to this test, which may daunt and dispirit the greatest hero, is no ways proportionable, especially seeing they may under the inspection of learned, honest and judicious men, both pastors and churches, and thereby under covert of more private invitations (with all their natural fear) creep into this noble work, and keeping on, as their courage and
<PB N="124" REF="012626_0123_0F8B8E7A87FC53A8"/>
strength will bear the journey, may, gradatim attain a just and sufficient probation, as our learned youth have hitherto done.</P>
<P>Indeed, the bold and brazen, who can make a greater figure with half the stock, by many shirking tricks, and dissembling artifices, defended and supported with confi∣dence and delivery, may obtain the <HI>Euge Juvenis,</HI> that they no ways deserve, as will be found, when they come to be detected by a more dilatory search, or a more tedi∣ous <HI>Analysis</HI> made of them. That, to conclude, as the proverb is, <HI>Una Hirundo non facit ver</HI>; one swallow makes not the spring; so in this trial, one good or mean sermon cannot determine the man, or umpire his case.</P>
<P N="2">2. Suppose the trial must be made, and the question determined by a person's conversation. And this is a very great article in the state of all serviceable men, and especi∣ally in the ministry, 1 Tim. 4.12. 1 Pet. 5.3. Be∣ing ensamples to the flock. Then certainly a more intimate converse and society, is a very invincible plea. By the laws and customs of England, the vicinage must be al∣lowed, as affording the most competent judges, when persons reputation lies at stake in criminal cases, because they are presumed to know somewhat considerable of per∣sons and cases of their own knowledge; and so more ca∣pable of giving a just verdict. So in the case, what do those persons know of our learned youth, who make up the association? Our candidates appear on a certain day, (as blazing stars once in an age, and are gazed on, and then they vanish) Now what judgment can be made on a mans conversation, by such a transient view? unless they must be handled in this consistory, as persons that have been bound to the peace, and in open court are to be delivered from their recognizance by three outcries?</P>
<P N="3">3. Suppose the whole stock of ministerial qualifications must be enquired into, and judgment must pass by the direction of apostolic law, 1 Tim. 3.2. Tit. 1.6.9. <HI>Let them be blameless, sober, apt to teach,</HI> &amp;c. and add what more you please, which the scripture mentions, to fill up the character of an evangelical minister, to compleat him in all his gifts and graces, either in his beginnings, or in his riper state; and it is most apparent, that our particular pastors and churches, with the learning, experience, grace, wisdom and discretion they are owners of, can make a more
<PB N="125" REF="012626_0124_0F8B8E7B901BEE90"/>
upright, judicious and solid trial; and give a better ac∣count of our candidates from their frequent converse with them, and their occasional and repeated preaching amongst them, than the wisest association in the world can do; and it is easier dissembling with the latter, than the former, unless the association will take them home, and both winter and summer them.</P>
<P>Now then, considering that their degrees with the ex∣press testimony of the college (when particularly desired) are sufficient testimonials of their learning; and the expe∣rience of their other good gifts and ministerial qualificati∣ons, obtained by converse, and their occasional preaching, has been the chief test and trial for our candidates; and by these methods they have been approbated in order to settlement in office-trust; and this has been the custom of the country and churches for near four score years. Where∣fore to conclude this argument, I make this proclamation, That if any person or persons, disaffected with our old set∣tlements, and way in church conduct, will produce one example led into the public ministry by this practice, which has justly offended him, and he will or can evince this to be the blameable cause, we will then surrender the custom to your mercy.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. I shall now implead the proposal on a just preju∣dice or presumption of corruption in the clergy, tho' we are in charity for the present, yet in this way proposed, we have no assurance for the future, against the corruptness of such societies; and let any sober man observe, and he will find abundance of poor tools under the mark of the office, where these measures, and such like, are in force and form. How oft is it repeated, that poor sordid, debaucht wretches are put into Holy Orders, when as they were fit∣ter to be put into the stocks, or sent to bridewell for mad∣men, than to be sent with their testimonials, to work in Christ's vineyard? How long have the Indies, the seas, the provinces, and many other parts of the empire groaned un∣der this damnable way of cheating God of his glory, and the world of salvation?</P>
<P>Simony we know began almost as early as the christian church, and has prevailed amongst clergy-men to a prodi∣gy. The sacred things of God's house have been a trade and merchandize, which has beggared churches, and filled the clergy in some kingdoms with a sacriligious and exor∣bitant
<PB N="126" REF="012626_0125_0F8B8E7C27ACE7F8"/>
pile of wealth, and the world with a flood of de∣bau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es; and this proposal puts us into the way to open the shop-windows again, and expose the same wares to sale upon a little indulgence in our country; for who can render a reason that the same opportunities, the same temptations, the same corruptions, the same nature, and the same power, would not produce the same effects? or that the same climate, seed, ground, and manner of cul∣ture, should not yield the same grain at harvest?</P>
<P>And what have we in pledge for our security, more than the fallacy and sickleness of human nature, when the power is delivered out of our hands?</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> You may object, that our candidates, thro' their own ambition, and the indulgence of particular pastors, thrust themselves into the work too young, and this our way will prescribe due boundaries to them?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. In general, <HI>Paul</HI> solves a worse case, than can be found (pick whilst you are weary for an example to quadrate with the objection, and render it forceable) a∣mongst all our learned youth, who have hitherto adven∣tured upon the ministry, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.18. What then? &amp;c. as tho' he should say, What's that to you sir? If Christ be preached, all is well. And as to our case, we may say, despise not the day of small things, all men must have a beginning, and every bird which is pretty well fleg'd must begin to fly. And ours are not of the nest where <HI>Icharus</HI> was hatch'd, whose feathers were only glewed on; but these belong to the angelic host, and their wings grow out from their essence; therefore you may allow them, with the lark, now and then to dart heaven-ward, though the shell or down be scarce off from their heads. And so we conclude with our charitable and divine apostle▪ "What then! if Christ be preached, whether in pretence, or in truth, either by old or by young, yet therein we do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice, &amp;c. to see our <HI>Nazarites,</HI> so forward and well-disposed, it shall add to our joy, and no ways in∣crease our horror, unless our ambition should surprize us with fear, that such young stars should out-shine us.</P>
<P N="2">2. In particular, where will you six the <HI>Quando,</HI> &amp; settle the precise aera, or period of time, for their beginning?</P>
<P N="1">1. There is no college or statute-law yet enacted, to de∣cide this question: Then of necessity you must do domage to long and laudable custom, as to a superior authority, and
<PB N="127" REF="012626_0126_0F8B8E8095280FB8"/>
honorable ruler; &amp; where that fixes the time, you must sub∣mit; for custom, when full of days, and of noble examples, becomes the common law of a nation; and is as sovereign and pleadable, as the dictates of a parliamentary power; at least it shelters from rebukes and calumny: That for any gentlemen to affront, talk high and frown at the early zeal and beginnings of our candidates, is but too much in imitation of the <HI>Great Mogul of India,</HI> who after he hath dined, orders his trumpets to be blown, to signify to the princes of the earth, that they have liberty now to go to dinner; and when he hath finished his formalities, if they please, they may vail their royal bonnets, and thank him for nothing; for where there is no law, there is no trans∣gression.</P>
<P N="2">2. Under the gospel, we have no precise time, though there was under the law, when to begin and enter into the ministry, the gospel knows no bar from time where persons are other ways meetly qualified. Days and qualifications, are divers things, and the latter are the essentials of a mi∣nister of Christ. It is not how old, but how capable a person is, which is the main point to be enquired after here. Therefore where (in some good measure) there is an honest life, a gracious heart, an orthodox head, and a learned tongue, there is no reason to send such youths to <HI>Jerico,</HI> with <HI>David</HI>'s messengers, (though their beards are not yet grown) to wait upon time and nature, for such an accomplishment; for certainly those recited are the princi∣pal in the argument. It is a story in the history of Persia, "That when the Grecians sent some very young noble∣men upon an embassage to that court, the Persians reflect∣ed upon the Grecian republic, for sending b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rdless boys on so grave a message to so mighty a monarch," To which the young Grecians very smartly answered, "That if state policy did consist in beards, then he-goats would do for embassadors, as well or better than men." I must confess, I am some-what of their mind▪ and therefore I think it is not, how long men have lived, but how wise they are grown: God hath oadained praise out of the mouths of babes. <HI>Jeremiah</HI> pleads he was a child, but that cannot null his commission for the ministry, <HI>Jer.</HI> 1.6. <HI>Paul</HI> guards the ministry of young <HI>Timothy,</HI> by heavens authori∣ty, to defend him from censure for audaciousness. What! for a child to teach old men their duty! Hold! says <HI>Paul,</HI>

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Not always and universally so; as in the exam∣ples just now recited, and in many others that may be na∣med, called in at the third and sixth hour, <HI>Mat.</HI> 20. But however, if our candidates must never begin till they are without ignorance, or not till they have gained all points (<HI>ad unguem</HI>) in the vast studies of divinity, then it may be said of all our ministers, as queen Elizabeth was wont to say of bishops, when she visited the schools (study hard children, study hard, for) bishops are old men. So of ne∣cessity, all our ministers must be very old men. But I think that is more agreab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with our necessity and state, both in nature and grace, which one of the ancients was wont to say of himself, viz. that whilst he studied to teach other men, he learnt himself. That considering theology, as well as art, is a long study, and life is very short, why may they not begin young? And also, considering that our churches are no ways over cluttered with candidates, there is no need to serve them as Christ did the money changers, who with a whip of small cords, he drove them out of the temple; and especially they having hitherto acquitted themselves in the main as men that need not be ashamed, and yet never any one of them, to this day, has been represented as learned or virtuous, or any ways sup∣ported by these testimonials.</P>

<P><HI>Answer.</HI> According to my apprehension, this proposal insults very daringly over the churches in two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. By ingrossing the right of jurisdiction, not only over the visible freedom and liberties, but conjugal and secret powers of Christ's virgin and widow churches. That it seems to me very adviseable (if this proposal may stand for

a sound precept) that forthwith another office be erected▪ and put into the hands and under the government of a few men, exactly skilled in physiognomy, and deeply studied in the sympathies and antipathies of human nature, with an absolute superintending power to controul and direct all wooers in their choice for the marriage bed; for that there is many a fond lover who has betrayed the glory of wedlock, by making an unwise and unfortunate choice; and why may not particular beds be over-ruled, as well as particular churches? both being for the good and ser∣vice of mankind, and for that both parties, husband and wife, pastor and church, by our sort of government, are bound for term of life, or so long as both shall live. In∣deed, were our constitution in church order under the super∣intendency of a patron, or a lord bishop, who can send <HI>(pro Tempore)</HI> a curate, &amp;c. and then recall him, and place another in his stead, the project might be very ad∣viseable; but seeing these churches are settled congrega∣tional, and by their principles, the ordination is, as it were, the nuptials, or marriage day of two lovers, that nothing but death, or a bill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> divorce (for betraying the glory of the union) can part; it is then good and reasonable, that they be left to choose as they best affect, and not forci∣bly be tied up to a kind of Hobsons choice, one of these or none. This apparently puts too hard upon the churches liberties, and overthrows the government; for that our platform, in chap. 2. treating of the nature of the churches, asserts, sect. 5. That the state of the visible church since the coming of Christ, is only congregational; therefore neither national, provincial, nor classical; then what does this proposal do here?</P>
<P>Also, our platform asserts the free electing power of the churches, chap. 5. In these words, ordinary church power is that of privilege, such as belong to the brother-hood, whereby they design persons unto office. So also in chap. 10. In these words, the power granted by Christ unto the body of the church and brother-hood is a prerogative or privilege which the church doth exercise in the admission of her own members, and in chusing their own officers. Now if Christ has given these high powers and authorities to his churches, he has certainly furnished them with skill and wisdom to manage them.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="012626_0129_0F8B8E8388E7C130"/>So we come to the second part of the affront in this pro∣posal, and that is,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. By its making a plain presumption of incapa∣city in the churches of doing their own proper work with out the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r graces help. It is as much as to say, Alas! Alas! It is w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll known that the churches are generally a sort of plain men, little skilled in deep matters; that there is ap∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rent danger, if left in their elections to their own con∣duct, of introducing very illiterate persons and doleful creatures, to preach in the temple of God, as officers there. Now this is much agreeing with the old arguments, against the laity, who were described by the learned to be without the knowledge of the original languages, and other parts of polite learning, and so no ways fit to interpret scrip∣ture; therefore it is very rationally enacted, that the BIBLE be taken from them lest they should study heresie and not holiness out of that divine book. But to pass by all such pleas, I sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll come to the main point in plain terms, and that is this, our platform is our settlement, and it has secured to the churches these preroga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ives, and they are part of their entailed inheritance; and it is a vain thing to pretend to plead the incapacity of right owners and rich proprietors, especially whilst there is a competent set of senses left them. Indeed, when any gentleman can shew any precept, and produce a commission for the taking into their hands the estate of idiot-churches, they may then cite their intellectuals to a proper bar, and verdict going against any particular example, they then, <HI>Ipso facto,</HI> become guard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans, and may enter into their worship. But in the mean time, as to our own churches, and the whole constel∣lations of them, and every individual or particular church amongst them remains <HI>compos mentis,</HI> and therefore must not be intrigued by such offers as these are.</P>
<P>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet before I close this argument, I shall a little fur∣ther <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umour the presumption of insufficiency here laid down; and therefore I shall desire, that a survey be made of the state of the churches, and if their free election be sound for this thirty years last past (and we will go no higher) have by the major part of voices introduced insuf∣ficient officers, then let the platform be null'd, and the proposal stand as a more valid canon. And in this in∣quiry we would know, whether the dictators will give leave (in drawing up the catalogue of defective elections) that

they themselves be put on the back of the title page, and there stand as the errata of our old government? Or whe∣ther they themselves are the only exceptions?</P>
<P>But suppose we, when we have accomplished our search, we find their own, and all other elections for the main have hit right; and if so, then whether we ought not to pay a veneration to the practice, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ving more of Christ in it than we can in the rufflings of ambition presently find out, or perceive? And whether after such long expe∣rience and good success, it may'nt be our wisdom to keep this <HI>via Trita,</HI> which we have found to be <HI>via Tuta,</HI> that is to say, keep the good old way of our blessed predeces∣sors, lest going into a new and untrodden path, we fall into some ambuscado, and come off with broken bones and ruin'd churches?</P>

<P>Indeed, when great men turn beggars for small booties, with the famous general <HI>Baziliareous,</HI> it signifies, the ebb of fortune runs low with them; but when they ask an an∣cient inheritence upon gift, it signifies either the doner to be in a languishing posture, and that his estate is like to escheat to the crown, through failure of natural heirs, or else great boldness in the beggars. But what should be the meaning of this demand, who can divine? I hope they don't reckon the churches to be making their last will, and design them for their heirs.</P>
<P>The churches in New-England are fairly possest of this high prerogative, viz. Of convening councils necessary for their own well being, they are also as likely to continue as they were forty years ago, unless their own pastors should betray them. And they are also as capable of managing all instruments devolved upon them by Christ, as they were in the days of their youth. Then what can we make of this contrivement, viz. When the churches shall have occasion to seek relief by council (as sometimes the empe∣ror, has been confined at the insolent threshold of his ho∣liness, and upon his coming forth in his infallibility, this pile of temporal glory has been his horse-block; and so here) they must humbly wait at the door of the associa∣tion, till they shall be informed, When, what, who, and where they shall have one.

<P>Answ.

Yet in paying our veneration and attendance, we must distinguish right, and place every thing properly, and the means must be proportionate with the end, and agreable in their natures; or otherwise whilst we go about to accomplish a good end, viz. the security of religion by improper means we may lose our attempt, and have no thanks, but be blamed for our pains; for we must not do evil, that good may come.</P>

<P>Sect. And paticularly it is thought necessary to the well being of these churches, that all the associations in the country meet together, by their respective delegates, once in a year.</P>
<P>Answ. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s is a great thesis; and whoever was the father, the womb of it is very fertile, and big with arti∣cles of moment; it comprehends a large territory, and a great treasure, we must therefore survey it by cosinogra∣phy: And then nextly by the laws of the church stock.</P>
<P N="1">1. The country contained in this proposal, by a just consequence, and from the nature of the design, must ex∣tend so far as we can find any gospel churches planted, or to be planted within the English dominion on the firm land or continent of <HI>America,</HI> there is no restriction made to exclude any; and charity is a grace that would have every one virtuous, and equally privileged with means for that end; so that we may begin our lines of latitude in in the south, somewhat northward of the capes of <HI>Florida,</HI> and then extend them to the north, to some parts of <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> if not to the bay of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> and from those points on to the atlantic; we must stretch our lines over∣thwart, keeping equal longitudes, till we meet with other princes dominions.</P>
<P>Now this is a noble territory; enough for an empire, and all English; and why may we not be thus extensive for the good of the churches therein planted? Other countries have sent their delegates near as far as this comes to, to wait upon the conventions of his holiness. But, the mischief is, the revenue won't hold out. But I have tho't of one way, and that will do, if we can but obtain; tho' I acknowledge it is somewhat chimerical, or whimsical; yet though it be, the proposal has no reason to repine or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd fault, for that it is it's near kins-man.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="012626_0134_0F8B8E880FF0A0A0"/>The project is this, viz.

<P>AND finally, that ministers disposed to associate, endeavor in the most efficacious manner they can, to prevail with such ministers, as unreasonably ne∣glect such meetings with their brethren in their proper as∣sociations, that they would not expose themselves to the inconveniencies that such neglects cannot but be attended withal.</P>
<P>Answer. This proposal seems to be founded upon the <HI>Epicurian</HI> doctrine of atoms; for by the scheme which athiestical atomists give concerning the beginning of the world, by their account; it was after this lucky manner, that is to say, there was before time a vast pile of incohe∣rent atoms, which globically hung sleeping upon a centre-atom, without the least grain of sense, thro' the vast eter∣nity, <HI>a Parte Ante</HI>; but at last, and no body can tell how, they were inclined to throw off their present posture; but being neither of one form, inclination nor prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsion, quickly great heaving and shuffing (from various sympa∣thies and antipathies) began to be amongst them, that a chaos is presently rolled together, and in a little time, this magnificent and curious world, which you look upon, came out of the horrid womb of this distracted heap of atoms, and that without any help from a creating power, but by a wonderful good chance. Thus far you have the doctrine of atoms, which I could not well avoid, because of so much
<PB N="136" REF="012626_0135_0F8B8E88E48EC3C0"/>
noble matter pre-existing, and repesented in various shapes and forms, with a sound of motion, and various sympa∣thies and antipathies appearing, and represented by the proposal; but yet can hear of no superintending siat, or any creating voice to over-rule, or say, <HI>Let it be.</HI> But only if persons are disposed, or indisposed, the business must be managed as wisely as you can; and if it should so chance, that some fine thing (never before seen in the country) should be made out of these materials, without the help of a creating power, the world would be a great debtor to the accident; and the churches may they not be justly stript of their being to make room for it, and main∣tain it?</P>
<P>But to be more distinct, and somewhat more close in my answer, I must remind you, that our blessed Lord commands us to pray, Mat. 6. Our father which art in heaven, &amp;c. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. And if sincere, he hath promised, to stablish us, and keep us from evil. 2 Thess. 3.3. From these divine principles, the question is, whether those pastors are the stable or unstable, the reasonable, or unreasonable men, viz. Either those who have promoted this design in the country, or those who have withstood it? And also where has temptation prevailed most? And to put this debate under a brighter light, I will make bold to recite a brief history of this matter, till we bring you to the nati∣vity of these proposals, and to the day wherein they were born; with some present improvement of the history.</P>
<P>About thirty years ago, more or less, there was no ap∣pearance of the associations of pastors in these colonies, and in some parts and places, there is none yet. But af∣ter the country had suffered much in the slaughters and depredations committed by the heathen, and by many other afflictions, the neighbouring ministers in some counties, met to pray together, &amp;c. and for no other intent, that I ever knew or heard of. But after they had continued their meetings for some years, and others following the example began to converse together, and communicate cases, as best suited each person; and at last perceiving they were al∣most gotton into a classical form, before they tho't of it, they began to give their meetings the specious titles of classes, associations and ecclesiastical conventions, &amp;c. as securely as tho' these titles were a fruit growing out of our
<PB N="137" REF="012626_0136_0F8B8E89DD8FD730"/>
own constitution; and by degrees began to dream that they were really, and <HI>de Jure,</HI> what their new titles and late custom had made them only <HI>de facto</HI>; and time in∣creased their inclinations and purposes to compass a more formal and compleat settlement. It is certain, their op∣portunities were considerable, the keys of the church trea∣sures being put into their hands. The more the main point is studied, the more glory appears to feed mens ambition, like the impression by the eye, on our great parents in pa∣radice, Gen. 3.8. The tree was pleasant to the eyes, a tree to be desired. Alas! Alas! empire and supream rule is a glorious thing! <HI>Parcere subjectis et debellare Su∣perbus,</HI> is a very royal business. Now this conceit did be∣gin pretty much to predominate, especially in some gen∣tlemen that were inclin'd to presbyterain principles, men of worth and learning, who improving their advant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges of sense and influence, to intreague others of a lower set of intellectuals, &amp;c. bro't the business so near to a conclu∣sion, as you find it in the last recited proposal, wherein you have the main of this history contained, like <HI>Homer's Illiads</HI> in a nut shell. But to make short, and conclude my story; when they had thus far advanced and ripened their design, out comes these proposals, like Aaron's golden calf, the fifth day of November, 1705.</P>
<P>Thus have you a short account how things have been carried on, relating to associations; and having a conveni∣ent crisis, I shall improve the history, to promote my pre∣sent design, in a few particulars.</P>

<P N="1">1. As to the duty of such as are involved in the charge, whether or no (upon a presumption that thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> history be true) they ought not to cease exciting others to wander from their proper post, and they themselves (if not by the open acts of the churches authority, yet) by the good go∣vernment of their own wisdom, prudence &amp; grace, be remand∣ed within their proper boundaries, &amp; there continue as stars within their own orbs, to influence and act, <HI>Tam in Modis quam in statis, qua prius,</HI> according to the former usage▪ and
<PB N="138" REF="012626_0137_0F8B8E8A4C9D7630"/>
the nature of their trust, and no more go beyond their own line, 2 Cor. 10.16.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether these proposals here offered to view, be not like Aaron's golden calf? And whether they ought not to be served, as Moses dealt with that, (Exod. 32.20.) when he took it, and burnt it in the fire; and ground it to pow∣der; for that it is very evident, that though it be but a calf now, yet in time it may grow (being of a thirsty na∣ture) to become a sturdy ox, that will know no whoa, and it may be past the churches skill then to subdue it.</P>
<P>For if I am not much mistaken (and <HI>Pareus</HI> too) That great and terrible beast with seven heads and ten horns, described in the Revelations 13, was nothing else a few ages ago, but just such another calf as this is. It was indeed finely shap'd, &amp; of neat limbs, when it was first calved; in∣somuch that the great potentates of the earth were much ravished with its aspect and features; some offered to suc∣kle it on the choicest cows amongst all the herds of royal cattle, (that it might be large) hoping to stock their own countries with the breed, &amp; when it was grown to a consider∣able magnitude, to render it more shapely and fair, they put iron tips on to its horns, and beset its stupenduous bulk with very rich ornaments, that they might make it the more awing to all beholders, and if possible, by such artifi∣ces to add to the natural pride rnd choler of the creature.</P>
<P>But alas, poor men! they have paid dear for their pro∣digality and fondness; for this very creature that was but a calf when they first began to feed it, is now grown to be such a mad furious and wild bull, that there is scarce a christian monarch on earth, unless the great <HI>Anne,</HI> their Sweedish and Prussian majesties, and their High Mighti∣nesses, with this exception, there is scarce a potentate in the world, the best horse-man or hunts-man of them all, that dare take this beast by the horns, when he begins to bounce and bellow. Indeed the emperor within these few years, has recovered so much courage, that he took him by the tail, to drive him out of his royal granges, being quite angry, and weary with his cropping and brouzing on the flowers of his imperial crown. But otherwise the beast ge∣nerally goes at large and does what he will in all princes dominions, and keeps them in awe. Therefore to con∣clude, and infer, <HI>Obsta Principiis</HI>! It is wisdom to nip such growths in the bud, and keep down by early slaughter
<PB N="139" REF="012626_0138_0F8B8E8B2D4E82C0"/>
such a breed of cattle. <HI>Nam omne malum nascens facile op∣primitur.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. In all the astrological remarks I have made, I find its nativity full of favoruble aspects to English chur∣ches. The fifth day of November has been as a guardian angel to the most sacred interest of the empire: It has res∣cued the whole glory of church and state, from the most fatal arrest of hell and <HI>Rome.</HI> That had I been of the ca∣bal, or combination, which formed these proposals; so soon as I had seen and perceived the date, (as I imagine) my heart with king David's, would have smo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e me, and I should have cried out, <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>serere nostri Deus</HI>: The good Lord have mercy upon us; this is the gun-powder treason day; and we are every man ruined, being running <HI>Faux</HI>'s fate! why gentlemen! have you forgot it? It is the day of the gun-powder-treason, and a fatal day to traitors.</P>
<P>Our measures certainly intend the blowing up the chur∣ches, as <HI>Faux</HI>'s did the parliament; that for my own part, I have such an awe upon my mind of this very day, that I have made a settled resolution, that of all the days of the whole year, I will never conspire treason against my natural prince, nor mischief to the churches on the fifth day of November.</P>

<P N="1">1. We must observe the seeming favor the lay-dele∣getes or fraternity of the churches are treated with in this proposal; for at the first tender, they seem very honora∣ble to be invited into the association, as though they were to be established members of this council; and were to be equal sharers in the authority and government in it; yet do but mind the connection of both parts of the propositi∣on, and you will find there is nothing of this nature intend∣ed for them. But only by a specious shew, they are in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ited to establish the associations on their tottering basis, and that is soon done, if all parties are agreed; and from the fraternity, there is no need of any more formalities, than paying homage to their authority by this act of sub∣mission and obedience here proposed; and so soon as this is done, you shall find the fraternity very fairly released at the door of the sessions, every man repairing to his own home. It is an observation, on the monarchy of bees, that the drones formerly supposed to be not only a lumpish, but a useless bee, yet is of that nature, and so essential a member of that common-wealth, that it is really the male-bee, and does impregnate the females, who are the sole labourers in that kingdom, but when that crisis is over, the poor drones are by common consent banished, as a great incumberment. So in our case, alas! what can be expected, when the lay-delegates have done the former jobb, but that they shall be laid by, for their wisdom and capacity is no ways admired in these proposals. And it has always been found that the laity are a clog to clergy-men, when they begin to soar a-loft, or above their pro∣per sphere; and if you will but view the proposal again, in the hindermost part of it, you will see a back-door ve∣ry artificially finished and left upon l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tch▪ for their exclusi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n; for tho they are called to be members of the council

For you must note, that after they have ad∣mitted the brethren, and viewed the certificates of election from the several churches, containing some congratulatory compliments, to honor the new constitution and govern∣ment, as is usual in all states, and having also treated the delegates with the civilities of the house, and also with a long and tedious harrangue of the mighty blessings these new settlements plainly predict and promise the country, &amp;c. the delegates are then advised, there is no case at pre∣sent depending fit for their cognizance, but what are upon file, the associates have already considered about it, and referred to some other council best known to their graces. And so good brethren, you are now with many thanks for your obedient attendance, released till <HI>Latter Lammas,</HI> or till the <HI>Greek Calands</HI> come about.</P>
<P>And here we may dig a grave to bury all our ancient privileges in, and hang our harps upon the willows, and when we are thus wasted, should you call us in once more to sing one of the songs of Sion, all our notes must be <HI>Elegie et De tristibus,</HI> yet the broken accents, and lowly murmurs of our sorrow will serve for elahs and sweet dia∣pasans, in your conquering song of triumph.</P>
<P N="2">2. We must nextly, survey the nature of the council, which cannot be sooner, and with better advantage (to re∣present the true idea of it to every man's understanding) than in a brief definition, thus, the council is to be stand∣ing and stated, to meet once in the year at least, and at o∣ther times as each association shall please to determine, to enquire into the condition of the churches, and advise such things as may be for the advantage of our holy religion. Thus you have the nature of it laid out in terms very con∣cisely.</P>
<P>But if a longer description, according to the genuine sense of expressions in the proposals, will better suit you, and give a better impression of its nature upon you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tho'ts we may then describe it thus,</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="012626_0141_0F8B8E8D601E7D08"/>It it a council of human invention, stated and settled to convene once in the year, yearly, during the revolution of the heavenly bodies, and at other certain times of the year, so as to keep its course parallel with our high and superior sessions of the peace, if the creators please; and to consult, advise and determine all affairs within the reach of ecclesi∣astical councils, and especially, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And thus, we being a people swimming in such plenty, that all our chargeable measures both domestic in our pri∣vate families, and public in church and common wealth, being not near sufficient, to take off our waste, and super∣fluous streams, and our riches and stores so plainly over∣loading us, we have here formed a creature, that will help to sup up all, &amp; seeding upon our fall baskets, we shall find that the further we go with <HI>Aesop</HI>'s load the lighter we shall grow; then who will not admire the wisdom of the invention?</P>
<P N="3">3. Our next task is to examine the original of this coun∣cil, which enquiry, may be resolved into this disjunct pro∣position, viz. This council in the result of the will, obey∣ing the understanding in its last dictates, erring or not err∣ing.</P>
<P>The question being thus stated, it is at every man's li∣berty, to take the part in the disjunction which best likes him. I suppose the proposal arrested and brought to trial, will plead not erring, or not guilty, as is usual with all criminals, when indicted; and therefore seeing you expect to be cleared by the jury, you must give us an honest ac∣count, who set you on work, and what rule you were guided by to assure us that your intellectual powers were free from error in forming this council, and we will give you room enough in your own defence. For,</P>
<P N="1">1st. If you can produce evidence from the canon of scripture, in express terms, or by sound consequence, and prove <HI>New-England</HI> churches are obliged to form a standing and stated council, or that you are to do it for them, &amp;c. we will submit. But no such canon can be found. The proposals then incur a heavy premunire for making so bold with a settled government, and no text to warrant the at∣tempt.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is it by any authority, derived from the civil govern∣ment of the country by law, or practice, that this council is here erected?</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="143" REF="012626_0142_0F8B8E8E2FBFF7F0"/>1. By law, if there be any such law, you have liberty to plead it in your own defence.</P>
<P N="2">2. By practice, has the civil government ever set such an example? Have they ever intrenched upon the privili∣ges of the churches in the least degree? And in their own orb, are they not more exemplary? Don't all men keep to commission? Are they not curious in maintaining all settled forms, as the limits and boundaries of all mens ac∣tions and interests? Nay, is not the exalted head of this body politic in his whole ministry, careful to steer all his actions by his commission, and the precept of law? Is not the least error (though made by jealousy, and not found in reality) that looks but like an arbitrary action presently drawn into complaint, as a great grievance, and common nusance? If it be but in dream, that the exche∣quer appears touched, without a precept, or the wings of our civil liberties clipt, or so much as a feather be plucked from them, is not the country here and the court at home filled with complaints? What means all this? And yet must these churches, formed by principles of piety and honor, and under the steerage of a wise and just govern∣ment, bear whole cart-loads of injuries, and have all their liberties violated? And at last have a stated anti-christian arbitrary council, that can cut their throats for all the wise regulation, that is in it, be thurst in upon them, and both scripture and the wise fathers of the common-wealth, no patrons to it? And what must we swallow all this? This must needs be a very heavy meal to digest!</P>

<L>They take our wealth, and leave us naught but trash.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P N="3">3. Is there any certificate, order, or vote, from the churches, as the womb of this council? If there be, the proposals shall then pass for the innocent midwife, and no harm shall come. But alas! if we search all church records, the pursuit is blankt! Therefore it must stand for a daring intrusion upon the churches power of privilege.</P>
<P>It is and will be acknowledged, with great justice and satisfaction, that the pastors of the churches are in a high station, as they represent the great shepherd, and their
<PB N="144" REF="012626_0143_0F8B8E9060926100"/>
trust is noble and great; they are rulers, and to conduct all transactions, &amp;c. But yet must never infringe the churches power of privilege in any branch of it? It becomes the holiness, wisdom and honor of the ruling officers at a crisis, when the churches are in exercise of this power, not to allow themselves to dictate too imperiously: They must never indeed, in all their ministration, talk with such an elevated language, as in the 3d section of the second part, in these words, viz. That each church chuse and depute one or more (private members) to attend their pastor in their stated session, &amp;c. As tho' the high commission court was returned from exile, and now opened, and some of your graces were to be lord chancellor; this plainly car∣rieth too high a crest. What! to consider yourselves as a distinct estate from the churches, and to send out of your higher house your orders to be obey'd in the lower house, &amp;c? But, I say, this is not right, for in convening and calling of councils the churches are your superiors; and upon a severe interpretation of their canons, they may, if they please, leave you at home. For tho' you have been elected once into office, yet in the exercise of this their power, you stand but competitors with other principal per∣sons, for their choice &amp; election, to determine you members of an ecclesiastical council: Possibly this doctrine may seem to be but a very crude dose. But yet I assure you, it is approbated by a college of very able and learned physici∣ans; and I hand it to you as I find it made up in the churches chest of medicines, platform, chap. 16. sect. 2. The efficient cause of ecclesiastical councils, or synodical assemblies, next under Christ, is the power of the churches sending forth their elders and other messengers, &amp;c. sect. 3. Magistrates have power to call a synod, by calling to the churches to send forth their elders, and messengers, &amp;c. for the consti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uting of a synod, is a church act, sect. 6. Because none are or should be more fit to know the state of the churches, nor to advise of ways, &amp;c. There∣fore it is fit, that in the choice of the messengers for such assemblies, they have special respect unto such, viz. elders: That certainly if you expect your council shall escape con∣demnation, you must then produce the <HI>Probatum est</HI> of the churches, or else it perishes under this trial.</P>
<P N="4">4. Can you shew any patent for the imperial chamber of our mighty monarch, to take into your hands (tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="145" REF="012626_0144_0F8B8E91254394D0"/>
you may new model) these churches (the royal demesnes of Christ Jesus, the prince of peace) as an escheat to the crown? Or have you commission with instructions from thence to erect within the province, such costly and for∣midable assemblies, as are here projected? Nay, if you can find or pick up amongst the old statutes, that are not quite worn out, or produce one venerable precept or example throughout the whole English empire, for the govern∣ment of church or state therein; we will state your case, and grant you one imparlance (with due time) if you can make any reasonable presumption, it may be had for your justification; and in the mean time, I shall venture to re∣cite a few principles of the English government, that are like the <HI>Vana Cava,</HI> or great arteries in nature, which circulate the blood and spirits thro' the imperial body; and if they don't all with a joint voice (like a jury in their return, where no man dissents) condemn your council and whole scheme, you shall still have a goal delivery, and be set free.</P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> I. There is no one of the three estates of the empire, can make a valid act to bind the subject, or in∣stitute any new forms of government.</P>
<P>It is certain the parliament, that supream court, by an united voice, is very transcendent; it makes null, enacts, and abrogateth all laws, statutes and ordinances concerning matters ecclesiastical, civil, martial, martime, &amp;c. Therefore all acts, institutions, creations of trust, corporations and offices either originally and immediately, or by a fair consequence, derive from this fountain the imperial crown, inricht with many prerogatives, and adorn'd with many ample flowers; they were there planted by the creating power of the na∣tion, and no English monarch can at pleasure enlarge that garden with a new species. That to meet with such things as these now under debate within an English province, &amp;c. Query, Whether they are enacted by single men, or small factions; or by the united voice of the kingdom? If not by the latter, they must die traitors to the empire, as transgressing against the essentials of its constitution, and liberty of conscience is no city of refuge here.</P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> II. All English men are privileged by and strickly bound to the law; that's the fruitful reason of all good, and rule of duty. To be bound to the peace, or
<PB N="146" REF="012626_0145_0F8B8E91C95E3180"/>
the good behavior, is to be bound to the law, that's every mans master and guide. Query, whether these proposals, and this council, have not put a slight upon this do∣minion?</P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> III. The vengeance or vindictive justice of the nation, flames (in the sanction of the law) against all transgressors.</P>
<P>Every one that breaks the law, breaks from the rule of his duty and trust, and in a degree violates the power of the nation, and usurps the whole legislation; therefore in the execution of these direful sanctions and penalties affix∣ed to the statutes, the omnipotent power of the nation, re∣venges the glory of its own independence and unaccounta∣bleness upon its insolent subjects, according to that, Gen. 2.17. <HI>In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.</HI> Therefore I may say to this council, <HI>Memento Mori.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> IV. Every great person is under the awe of the law, either as directive or coersive.</P>
<P>It is the saying of those who are skilled in the law, That <HI>Reg in Rego Suo, Superiores habet, DEUM et LEGEM</HI>; The king has in his realm two superiors, GOD and the LAW, tho' he is only under the directive; but all his great subjects are under the coersive power of it. The nobles and great ministers in church and state look upon the law as the watchful eye of some direful numen. The superior clergy-men, the great bishops of the kingdom, tho' they appear masters of such prerogatives, yet they have nothing but what they derive from the law; and the laws are their boundaries, saying <HI>Hitherto you shall go, and no further at your peril.</HI> That those great men might as well have undertaken with <HI>Archimides,</HI> to have removed the earthly globe (upon condition) as to have done such a thing as this. What! to alter the constitution of church government, which is established by the statute, and canon law of church and nation? This is to blow up the whole kingdom. <HI>Ergo,</HI> put out your matches, and dissolve your trains.</P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> V. All Englishmen live and die by laws of their own making. That they are never pleased with up∣start law-makers.</P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> VI. That English government and law is a charter-party settled by mutual compact between persons
<PB N="147" REF="012626_0146_0F8B8E928834E038"/>
of all degrees in the nation, and no man must start from it at his peril.</P>
<P>Query, Whether these proposals have kept to the ar∣ticles of this great covenant?</P>
<P><HI>Principle</HI> VII. Englishmen hate an arbitrary power (politically considered) as they hate the devil.</P>
<P>For that they have through immemorial ages been the owners of very fair infranchizements and liberties, that the sense, favor or high esteem of them are (as it were) <HI>extra∣duce,</HI> transmitted with the elemental materials of their es∣sence fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m generation to generation, and so ingenate and mixed with their frame, that no artifice, craft or force used can root it out. <HI>Naturam expellas furca licet usque recurrit.</HI> And though many of their incautelous princes have endeavored to null all their charter rights and immu∣nities, and agrandize themselves in the servile state of the subjects, by setting up their own seperate will, for the great standard of government over the nations, yet they have all along paid dear for their attempts, both in the ru∣in of the nation, and in interrupting the increase of their own grandeur, and their foreign settlements and conquests.</P>
<P>Had the late reigns, before the accession of the great <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> to the throne of England, but taken the measures of them, and her present majesty, in depres∣sing vice, and advancing the union and wealth, and en∣couraging the prowice and bravery of the nation, they might by this time have been capable to have given laws to any monarch on earth; but spending their time in the pursuit of an absolute monarchy (contrary to the temper of the nation, and the ancient constitution of the government) through all the meanders of state craft: It has apparently kept back the glory, and dampt all the most noble affairs of the nation. And when under the midwifry of <HI>Machia∣vilan</HI> art, and cunning of a daring prince, this MONSTER, tyranny, and arbitrary government, was at last just born, upon the holding up of a finger! or upon the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st signal given, ON the whole nation goes upon this HYDRA.</P>
<P>The very name of an arbitrary government is ready to put an Englishman's blood into a fermentation; but when it really comes, and shakes its whip over their ears, and tells them it is their master, it makes them stark mad; and being of a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mical genius, and inclined to follow the court mode, they turn arbitrary too.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="012626_0147_0F8B8E934F4E2EB0"/>That some writers, who have observed the governments and humors of nations, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> distinguish the English:</P>
<P>The emperor (say they) is the king of kings, the king of Spain is the king of men, the king of France the king of asses, and the king of England the king of devils; for that the English nation can never be bridled, and rid by an arbitrary prince. Neither can any chains put on by dispotic and arbitrary measures hold these legions. That to conclude this plea, I find not amongst all the catalogues of heroes or worthy things in the English empire, peers to these undertakers; therefore we must needs range them with the arbitrary princes of the earth, (such as the great <HI>Czar</HI> or <HI>Ottoman</HI> monarch) who have no other rule to go∣vern by, but their own will. And therefore under this branch of our discourse, and their arbitrary measures, I shall venture to annex the following Theses, as conclusi∣ons fairly deducted from the premises, and leave them to consideration.</P>
<P><HI>Thesis</HI> 1. They have out-king'd all kings on earth, whose prerogatives are bounded, and their kingdoms go∣verned by law.</P>
<P><HI>Thesis</HI> 2. They have out bishop't all the bishops of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> whilst they they themselves have acted with such lawless liberty, and left the bishops fettered in the statutes.</P>
<P><HI>Thesis</HI> 3. They have out-pop't the pope himself, who is head of an hierarchy, supported by certain laws, acts and ordinances, for the maintaining an harmony or union between head and members. So in the next place,</P>
<P N="4">4. We come to survey the work cut out for this coun∣cil.</P>
<P><HI>CATO,</HI> that great and grave philosopher, did com∣monly demand (when any new project was propounded unto him) <HI>Cui Bono</HI>? or what good was like to en∣sue? Now in this present business, the definition pretends to make a satisfactory answer to such a question, viz. In the employment of this annual council; and that is to in∣quire into the condition of the churches, and advise such things as may be for the advantage of our holy religion.</P>
<P>It is certain, considering the nature of the creature here formed, there had need be some <HI>Herculean</HI> labor assigned. Those who are purveyors, and must provide quarters, will find it very chargeable, that it had need do very extraor∣dinary
<PB N="149" REF="012626_0148_0F8B8E940709E140"/>
business. As once king <HI>James</HI> the first said to big-lim'd country fellow, who came to court to be a por∣ter; some that knew him, told the king how many bowls full, and quarters of mutton he would eat at a meal; says the king to the fellow, You sirrah, that eat so much more than other men, if you cannot do so much more work than other men, by my so'l (says the king) I'll hang you. So here, there had need go a handsome stock of small cat∣tle, and other expences to maintain one sessions: that if it has confidence to meet, and is treated with an ordinary al∣lowance, if it cant do abundance of work, it will be waste charges, and great incumberment.</P>
<P>Now, if this be all that is here proposed (in my opini∣on) the creators are very defective in their proportions; for tho' the work mentioned is in itself good work; but it's all done already to their hands, there is nothing of this nature neglected in <HI>New-England</HI> churches; at least, no means or methods wanted; but as God says, <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.4. "What could have been done more for my vineyard, that I have not done in it:" may properly be applied to the churches here, and all for the anvantage and good of our holy religion; that, in a word, there is no want in this country, unless it be the want of good and honest hearts; and I suppose you have none of those to bequeath, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.9. Upon the first view of this stupenduous business, I was ready to fancy, whether or no you had dream'd of, or seen king <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth a coming with his old case and question, which involved the pope, his conclave, and all the accademies in Europe, and whether you were get∣ting a mighty casuist ready, to take the king's conscience into consideration? Or, whether you had news of the old <HI>Arian</HI> war, its breaking out again, that you should in such haste, (without citing other estates for the defence of the kingdom, but only by virtue of your prerogative) run up such a formidable and costly redoubt? But if it be all come to this, and there is no more to do, than what every pious and wise man does every day, every week, and every sessions, it is even another fit or paroxism of the mountains bringing forth, as the poet says, <HI>Par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uriunt Montes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But to humour what would seem serious in the pro∣posal, I shall consider both parts of the work dictinctly.</P>
<P>The first is, to enquire into the condition of the churches?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Now whether this precept, so full of sw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at and
<PB N="150" REF="012626_0149_0F8B8E94D5A58CB8"/>
servitude, may not vie it for merit, as equal in pains with any of the great prelates in Europe, in their laborious visitations; who when they come into some capital town in the other part of their diocess, and being treated with the solemn formalities of sumptuous feasts by the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood, and having spent the bigest part of their pastoral visit in glutting themselves with honor and full tables; at last begin the other part of their work, and inquire (possibly) how many pa∣rishes in this great town, and whether there be any chy∣rurgeons, physicians or school-masters, that do good to their neighbours without licence? Or, whether there be any new <HI>Golgotha</HI>'s to be dedicated, for the securer retreat of the dead to that place? Or, whether the parish curates read service well, and observe to time their particular les∣sons, with the canonical days? And especially, whether the bells are kept in good order? All which makes up a no∣ble piece of service, to requite a crown or kingdom for the revenues of a barony! And, whether it may be thought, that our great and yearly council, will come a whit behind the aforesaid ministry in the first or last part of service mentioned? And whether if they do but equal them, we may not be thought to have made a wise settlement? But notwithstanding we shall grant, the proposal makes menti∣on of a christian duty; for that it becomes all men, who bear a love to Christ, to enquire into the state of his chur∣ches, both for the manifesting their love to men, and di∣recting their prayers and gratitude to GOD. Therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. As to their outward and temporal state, we may in∣form ourselves, by virtue of neighbourhood, by christian travellers, and public letters of intelligence: and thus we may rationally, and with very good moral certainty know the state of the churches, both in other countries and our own; and thus good Nehemiah informs bimself at <HI>Shushan,</HI> how it fared with his brethren at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Neh. 1.2, 3.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to their moral state (which consists in their pro∣fession, faith, manner of worship, discipline and conversati∣on) this is discovered particularly, by their directories, confessions of faith, platforms, rubrick, liturgies, and o∣ther canonical systems, made public for that end, &amp;c. And considering, that whatever of this nature is necessary for the advance of religion, is well adjusted in this country, it must needs be but a vain repetition, or seaseless tautology
<PB N="151" REF="012626_0150_0F8B8E95B325DF40"/>
for a council to meet yearly or quarterly for this end, viz. To enquire what news, or whether New-England's con∣fession of faith is the same this year, as it was last? Or, whether all the churches, their manner of worship, is this sabbath as it was the other? And as to their conversation (which may seem to lie most out of sight) sufficient provi∣sion made by the principles of our wise platform (for up∣holding the communion of churches) for our enquiry and information here also. And thus we come to the other part of this good work, viz.</P>
<P N="2">2. To advise such things as may be for the advantage of our holy religion.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Query, Whether or no there be not published weekly from the oracles of God (and that with great sound∣ness and zeal) more truth in a day than all New-England can practice in a long time after? And whether all the churches in the whole land are not honored and addrest, from week to week, in such measures by infallible truth, if not by infallible men? Or whether or no these me∣thods dont divulge the whole mind of God to each plan∣tation? Or, whether these gentlemen have any secrets of wisdom not yet made known? Or, whether they intend to serve the churches, as some great philosophers and pro∣found artists in medicine serve the world, viz. such who carry some great inestimable <HI>Catholicon</HI> to the grave with them? And, whether they will be thus hard hearted in religion, as the other are in philosophy, unless he will gra∣tify them with this piece of prodigality here exacted? I must acknowledge I have little patience towards these things, that under such a specious shew and pretence, such a direful catastrophe should be shrouded! I must needs say, its plainly some of <HI>Joab</HI>'s friendship, when he spake quietly and peaceably to <HI>Abner,</HI> smiled in his face, as his friend, but stabbed him to the heart, under the fifth rib, that he dropt, and died.</P>
<P>But however, I shall endeavor, to resque myself from all impatience, and with deliberation sum up my answer, in an appeal to your own reasons concerning those several created trusts, which God has established, and cloathed with his own authority, every one of which is acted with great vigor, and success; and whether you think you can do more than all these for religion? Or prescribe some∣thing new which they never tho't of. As,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="152" REF="012626_0151_0F8B8E97E3407D88"/>1st. Civil authroity, in two great branches.</P>
<P N="1">1. Legislative power (that civil omnipotence) is doing very great things for religion, by their proclamations, and all penal laws enacted for the crushing of immorality and vice, and all their wise and exact precepts for the support of justice and piety. They are opening many civil chan∣nels, whereby they are conveying judgment, justice and righteousness down our streets, from the great fountain. Nay, this great and dread assembly puts awe upon all mankind. And the more daring and desperate are kept within compass, from a sense of this most terrible seat of thunder hanging over their heads, &amp; upon every affront ready to break in strokes of vengeance and woes upon them, especially if they grow beyond the reach of com∣mon law.</P>
<P>And in ordinary cases.</P>
<P N="2">2. The executive power, or ministers of the law, are like a standing camp to awe, and a flying army to beat off the enemy; they have their spies and scouts out in e∣very quarter to observe his motions, and break his mea∣sures, viz. In the innumerable numbers of all sorts of civil officers; and thus by the sword of justice they hunt down sin and impiety in the land. They are a terror to evil men and a praise to them that do well; for the civil authority, by their wise and just precepts, their personal and noble examples and zealous administrations, out-do <HI>Plato</HI> him∣self with all his moral reasons; for they can turn a Sodom into a Sion, and keep Sion to be Sion evident by the history &amp; chronicles of several governments of God's ancient people. <HI>Nam Regis ad Exemplum Totus Componitur Orbis.</HI> For chief rulers, by their good or bad measures, can make or marr, kill or cure a nation, in a moral sense.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>The churches.</HI></P>
<P>View once more, from some lofty promontory or <HI>Pis∣gah,</HI> those goodly tents and tabernacles of Israel! Listen! Is not God with them, and the shout of a king amongst them? Are they not as valleys spread forth, and as gar∣dens by the river side, which the Lord hath planted? And yet notwithstanding, may we, must we under your con∣duct, break up their fences, to give them another sort of culture? Nay, consider well! Are not the flowers bet∣ter wed, and the weeds more kept down, than in most of the inclosures in the world, belonging to the great hus∣band-man?
<PB N="153" REF="012626_0152_0F8B8E98850990E8"/>
And may you not (in reckoning up of means) allow us peculiarly to ascribe to their government and other of their measures agreeing with the nature of it in dressing the ground? But I will not enlarge this head; it is obvious enough from their ministry, from their faith, their discipline and conversations.</P>

<P N="2">2.The college (that artillery garden from whence we receive our most expert soldiers of Christ, and whence Christ's troops are supplied with cheif commanders, who lead on to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m the strong holds of the common enemy, and secure our great ally, religion) this is the seminary of learning and virtue, and the success is almost to a miracle, unless for humiliation we must secret the great grace and gifts of God which flow from that fountain, and are dis∣persed through the land.</P>
<P><HI>Query.</HI> Were a council called, of all the learned heads of the whole universe, could they dictate better laws, and advise better measures for the acquirement of learning, the increase of virtue and good religion, than are in that royal province?</P>
<P N="4">4. The families of the country with their oeconomy and family religion; if we take a survey of the whole land we shall find religion placed in the body politick, as the soul in the body natural. <HI>Nam est Tota Anima, in Toto Corpore, et Tota in Qualibet parte</HI>; that is, the whole soul is in the whole body, and whole in every part. That were any other part of the body organized besides the head, it would be capable to exercise reason, &amp;c. So religion is placed and exercised in its principles, virtues and govern∣ments through the families of the country, so many fami∣lies so many little sanctuaries.</P>
<P>I do acknowledge, there is no general rule, but has its execptions; but under this caution I may affirm, there is no such spot of earth in the earthly globe (so belaboured with family devotion, reading God's word, catechizing and well instructing youth, with neat and virtuous exam∣ples and divine prayers, <HI>non ex Codice, sed ex Corde,</HI> not out of books, but out of hearts, the solemnizing sabbaths and
<PB N="154" REF="012626_0153_0F8B8E9B5DF6E218"/>
and family attendance on public means) as is <HI>New-England.</HI> And if so, then what need have we of this late invention? Therefore to conclude, I shall, for my own part, with the jeal∣ous <HI>Laccoon,</HI> enter a caution against taking down the sides of the city, or opening the walls of our Sion to let in this Trojan horse; and let all Israel say, amen! For, bles∣sed be God, tho' we want to have our hearts renewed daily, but as for means, though we have no glut, we have plenty enough, and want no new institutions.</P>
<P>We come now to measure, and find out the time ap∣pointed for the council.</P>
<P N="1">1. Certain, viz. Once in the year at the least, all the as∣sociations in the country, and according to the most plausi∣ble interpretation of the proposals, one or more lay-de∣legates shall join and meet yearly and every year in the great assemblies.</P>
<P>Answer. As <HI>Austin</HI> says of time, <HI>Vivo in Tempore, Loquor de Tempere, sed Nescio quid sit Tempus,</HI> I live in time, I speak of time, but yet I know not what time is. So I do imagine, the dictators did not well weigh time by exact ballance, in all its contents, sense and meaning, when they carved out such a large proportion to this illegal claimer. Time is justly esteemed precious, in relation to heaven and grace, and also very valuable with respect to the interest of nature and this life. Therefore, care should be had, that it been't squandered away wastfully. Our na∣tural lives, healths and honor, families and estates are all very significant and costly things, and their dependence is much on the well husbanding of time, insomuch that in hard &amp; penurious climates, the inhabitants had need be very saving of time for the support of all these great interests, and especially seeing there is so much time already set off for religion. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. The seventh part of time is assigned by the wise au∣thor of time, and that well improved, will do much for the support of religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. There are great proportions (out of the time left to our dispose) frankly bequeathed for the good of religion, as in courts, churches, college, school, families, closets, and in many other sacred intervals, breathing spells from the hurry of business, render to men more sedate and heavenly (called time out of season) and all for the service of religi∣on; then to add and make this offering also, without a di∣vine mandate, is but a work of superarrogation or super∣stition,
<PB N="155" REF="012626_0154_0F8B8E9D90B8B360"/>
and so will prove not only a needless, but an extra∣vagant victim.</P>
<P>And moreover, to add a just aggravation or two, to set forth the evil in the imposition, I shall, with them, con∣clude the plea.</P>
<P><HI>Aggravation</HI> I. Is taken from the great and sufficient care and provision made by the 15th and 16th chapters of our platform, for the convening of occasional and needful coun∣cils, for the service of the churches, and support of religi∣on upon all emergencies. Then what need we throw a∣way so many years of time at a venture, as is here ten∣dered in the proposal, before our necessities or occasions call for the expence; unless we would in imitation of the <HI>Rho∣dian Coloss,</HI> or <HI>Egyptian Pyramids,</HI> erect a monument of our vain glory and pride, more than of our prudence, policy or duty.</P>
<P><HI>Aggravation</HI> II. Is taken from the great affront real and rational, done to empire.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Real,</HI> In making thus bold, with the time and estates of loyal subjects.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Rational</HI>; For let us but consider, that about three hundred men (gown men, and sword-men) with twice the number of attendants, which will make up near a thousand strong (and all well hors'd and provided) to be mustered no man living on earth can tell for what, cannot be well resented by crowned heads, those admirers of order: That the project carried on, may breed jealousies in the heart of our prince, least that <HI>Ket, Cade, Straw</HI> or <HI>Tyler</HI> have pitch't upon an oak of reformation again, with an intent to over∣hawl the government, &amp;c. And especially seeing the crown was never advised of any such thing (as is proposed) by the regular forms of empire. There is danger of losing our time, and the credit of our loyalty together; that all things considered, the best way will be for us to keep well, whilst we are well; and therefore let every man and society be advised to improve their time wisely, keep in their post and honestly study to do their own business, which God, law and regular settlements has intrusted them with; and we may then hope things will go well with us, and our holy religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Uncertain,</HI> viz. When the creators please, and can a∣gree, for the more particular time is best left to the deter∣mination of each association, as the proposal affirms. And
<PB N="156" REF="012626_0155_0F8B8E9E759BB1A0"/>
thus we are left very uncertain, when, where or whether it will ever be; so that I preceive, you have no great de∣pendance upon it, neither must we; The wisdom of civil government hath another sort of conduct. Such things are not left to discretion, for that would be indiscretion, and the way to turn the world into a bedlam, or the dwelling-place of mad men. And in the example before us, suppose the arbitrators (when the question for the time is propound∣ed) should differ, and hotly dispute the matter; and some should plead, it was best to be in the winter, and some in the summer; some argue for the fall, and some for the spring, according as every mans temper leads him; and at last, referring to a majority of voices, should they (for want of an odd man) lock it by an equal vote, and so keep it like a game atchess for several years on the table, and neither side get the mastery; we may then in our distresses hollow whilst our throats ach, &amp; no help comes; for they have voted them∣selves fast (like two bucks in their own horns) and can't stir for our relief.</P>
<P N="6">6. We must, according to promise, make some enquiry whether this council is to meet, or for the place of meeting?</P>
<P>It is held in opinion, that castles in the air, &amp; immaterial substances do not occupy place; philosophy assigns them no more than a <HI>Ubi,</HI> where many may exist in <HI>Puncto Indivisibli,</HI> or on the point of a needle; and if this coun∣cil is (as I apprehend it) belonging to that conjugation or cataloglue of beings, it will then have this privilege be∣longing to it, viz. There will be no house to build, nor house rent to pay,</P>
<P N="7">7. We come now (in the last place) to consider its maintainance, by three queries.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st. Query,</HI> Whether the churches in their expiring, must (as all criminals do) pay for their own execution, and their estates be confiscate, and reserved as a fund, yielding a certain stipend per annum, to support their executioners?</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d. Query,</HI> Whether the contingent fees of the sessi∣ons, or the free and voluntary contribution of clients, may be thought a medium sufficient? Or,</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d. Query,</HI> Whether it must not be here, as it is in some civil cases, under the cognizan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of a very peaceble and good natured justice, that for the healing of a difference amongst neighbours, advises them to agree, &amp;c. and so let every man bear his own charges▪</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="012626_0156_0F8B8E9EA2AFF588"/>But how it is, or which way they intend to raise a sup∣port for a standing council, yearly, and every year, I can∣not find out; there is no stipend settled, or provision made in the canons, which give it being.</P>
<P>It is certain, in the history of God's works, he first makes his house, &amp;c. then furnishes his table with great varieties; and then invites his guests, and makes them welcome; and so it is with all regular created efficients both rational and natural; but in this scheme there is nothing done for the support of the new born infant, but like a run-away dam, you leave it to the mercy of the heavens. But possibly the relief is stored up in your creating power; so that if the charitable churches will but find a cradle for the first night, and naturalize it, you will by your creating fiat, soon find a fortune, if all the tythes in the province will do it.</P>
<P>Thus, according to engagement, we have passed through the several heads, relating to the standing council, and I think by the analysis, it is sufficiently resolved into its first nothing; and therefore in what remains, I shall be more brief in my answer.</P>

<P>THAT to this end, these associated pastors, with their respective churches shall consociate and com∣bine.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> There is plainly an <HI>Hysteron</HI> and <HI>Proteron,</HI> (a preposterous speech, or misplacing of terms, pastors and churches) in this section; and though in rhetoric it breaks no great squares, yet in politics, where the just boundaries of governments are to be set out, the mis-placing some great words, may ruffle the whole scheme; so that accord∣ing to the more wary idiom of our church government, it should be written thus, viz.

<P>ACCORDING to what has been by the synods of these churches recommended, that they act as consociated churches, in all holy watchfulness and helpfulness towards each other.</P>
<P><HI>Answer. Titus</HI> the Roman general, is very honorable for his great pity to the Israelites, in many examples that
<PB N="158" REF="012626_0157_0F8B8EA0D62EE0F8"/>

<P>So here. Though you smile upon us, in reciting some of the principles of our own government, (for which we thank you) yet still we must observe the noise of your mattocks, that we may meet with your trenches, for you are still carrying on your works, and undermining us.</P>

<P><HI>Answer.</HI> You seem to reflect upon our beginnings, with a singular air and aspect, when you find any word or passage, that falls in with your design, as though you were sensible those things were very argumentative and binding; and indeed they are so. Then why cant you fall in with the whole settlement, and say to yourselves, what need we stand puzling our heads for new schemes a∣bout church-government? There is one from our begin∣nings, that is compleat, being adjusted by the laws of hon∣or, and assigns to all parties their due, and gives to officers rule, power and honor enough; therefore let us, now we are met, order a new impression, and so break up. For alas, alas! What need you, like the thievish bird, pick here and there a straw or a feather in our yards, to build a new nest? or now and then gather up a kernal, or a grain out of our first fruits? The whole plantation and crop is yours, if you please to make use of it; and it will be your livelihood, as it has been hitherto; only you must remem∣ber to pay the quit-rent, as honorable tenants, and not take yourselves to be lords of the manor.</P>

<P><HI>Answer.</HI> The beg'd prerogatives of clergy-men come so thick in this place, and smell so strong of the pope's cooks and kitchen, where his broaths and restoratives are prepared, that they are enough to strangle a free-born En∣glishman, and much more these churches, that have lived
<PB N="159" REF="012626_0158_0F8B8EA187675320"/>
in such a clear air, and under such enlargements so long a time. For indeed, (forsooth) four score years has brought (not our hogs, but) our innocent flock to a fair market, if it is come to this, that clergymen may buy and sell them (as the Romans did the Jews) thirty for a penny, or at least say, pro and con, at their pleasure, upon all the high immunities and ancient liberties of the churches, lion-like (who claims the whole prey, and leaves no share to his allies, <HI>vel Actum est de Amicitia</HI>) all is mine (says he) or farewell friendship.</P>

<HEAD>SECT VI.</HEAD>
<P>IT appears agreable with the present condition of our churches, and from our beginning acknowledged, that no act of the council is to be reckoned, concluded and desicive, for which there has not been the concurrence of the major part of the pastors therein concerned.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> 1. The specificating act, that impowers any member for an ecclesiastical council, is the churches electi∣on or delegation, according to our government; so that the members sent, are invested with the power, and repre∣sent those who send them: The officers have no more of this power devolved upon them, than any member, and therefore can challenge no more right (as elders) in a ma∣jor or in a negative vote, than any others, as is very ap∣parent in all representative bodies; therefore all acts must be determined by the majority of the whole, as in the house of commons, though made up of men of many dif∣ferent characters, when in their own countries, both as to their trust, learning and wisdom, and other distinguishing qualifications; yet the meanest man there has as great a force and power in his vote or suffrage, as the best man in the house, for that they all equally represent the nation, one man as much as another: So in this case; for that the churches and officers were never yet since New-England stood, held or accounted two distinct estates in an ecclesi∣astical council. Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. Your challenge plainly defines your intention, that is to null the power of the churches, and set up yourselves, as the subject or fountain of a superintending power. And then, if the churches may have so much favor as to repre∣sent themselves by their lay-delegates, in a council you shall see meet to call, you must needs allow them to be a distinct house and estate. And if so, then you must grant
<PB N="160" REF="012626_0159_0F8B8EA258A9ACC8"/>
them the privilege of a major vote, as well as yourselves, and so nothing can be acted but by their compliance also. But I must acknowledge, I have no plenipotentiary power to settle articles of agreement, for the infringing any of the rights of the churches, and therefore must draw up my memorials or complaints of incroachments upon ancient lines and boundaries, and so leave them.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THESE proposals were assented to by the delegates of the association, met according to former agree∣met at <HI>B. Sept.</HI> 13th, 1705, to be communicated.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> The church of England has been wont to look upon us as men out of our wits, therefore they term us phantics, or mad-men, but much more now. What! for men to break from the government they themselves have established by consent and practice, and arbitrarily to rally together, and draw up a direful sentence (if not in terms, yet in intent) for the dissolution of a country full of the best churches of Christ in the world, and then (as it were) upon the bold sound of a trumpet, to excite others to ratify the dead warrant, in order to execution! What can this import or signify in the thoughts of considerate men, but a vertiginous brain? We might have learned better, and more caution, from that mother church of the
<PB N="161" REF="012626_0160_0F8B8EA315622EA0"/>
nation, if not from common reason; for though our sove∣reign confides in the loyalty of the English clergy, yet to maintain the grandeur of government, and keep in good repair that common sence which keeps every man in his station, therefore, according to the law and custom of En∣gland, the convocation, both the higher and lower house of that learned and august assembly, neither debates nor transacts any matter whatsoever, but what our sovereign by commission expresly alloweth of, according to his pre∣rogative; so that certainly to acquit yourselves for wise men you should have done no less (in a matter of such weight and moment) than have petitioned the public authority for commission, before you had ventured thus far.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But possibly some may say, We have petitioned authority to establish our councils, since we have drawn them up in form.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This is to be preposterous, and agrees with that illegal way of hanging men and then judging them; but however it seems they turned a deaf ear to your demands; and well they might, for they are two wise men to alter the laws of the province, long customs and orderly settle∣ments of the churches to gratify an implicit faith in the stark naked <HI>Ipse Dixits</HI> of any men; that unless you can produce a mandamus from the crown, or a precept from a higher court, which by its divine authority shall awe and direct them, you may alway expect such entertainment in your precarious addresses; for most certainly you beg at the wrong door. For you beg without a brief.</P>
<P>To be commended to the several associated ministers in the several parts of the country, to be duely considered.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> And why not commended to the general court, as has been the custom of our beginnings, &amp;c. or why not commended nextly to the several churches? By the question proposed, the comfort, support, and well being of these churches was peculiarly pretended, then why might not they be nextly advised with, for their approbation or esteem? for if you intend it for a new suit, or change of apparel, or a set of armour for this army in banners, it must be the only way to try it on, it being now so near finishing; and if it be done work-man-like, you will have the credit and they the comfort of it; but if it prove too strait-laced, or should they feel themselves as David in
<PB N="162" REF="012626_0161_0F8B8EA3DF15BF98"/>
Saul's coat of mail, and should shrug at it, and say, we cannot go in these, we have not proved them; yet they may throw all by and keep to their own old suit, which is not yet half worn, and the worst come to the worst, you may by any lawful writ recover your wages of those who set you on work to blow at this forge.</P>
<P>That so what may be judged for the service of our GREAT LORD, and his holy churches.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> You acknowledge, and so do I, that these are holy churches, and (through the grace of their great Lord) they being so; then why should they be interrupted in their government and discipline, which has been a peculiar means for the advance and promoting holiness among them? They are strict in their government; curious, yet charit∣able in their admissions; in the election of all officers, they are nice, cautious, judicious, and in the main hitherto very successful. They are eagle-eyed in their watch; duly hot, and impartial in their process and ex∣emplary acts of justice; and so dependent and free from arrogance, that they acknowledge themselves accountable under the eye of the consociation, for their astministration; and freely and without covin, render an account of their actions, and are willing to receive advice, and &amp;c. Then why should you disturb them?</P>
<P>You acknowledge them to be holy churches, and you may well! Then certainly they are the bethels, where God dwells; and from his grace and presence, so illustri∣ous in them, why mayn't we conclude, God has said, this is my rest for ever, here will I dwell, for I have desired it? And will then any good man have an hand in pulling down these tabernacles of the almighty? No! rather let every man involved, say, as once Job did, I will lay my hand upon my mouth; once have I spoken, but I will not an∣swer; yea, twice, but I will proceed no further, lest I am found fighting against God; for it is most certain, all men will find themselves over-match't in such a war.</P>
<P><HI>Be proceeded in.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I think we are proceeding in the best method we can for the present, for the service of these churches▪ that is to say, the criminal proposals being now at the bar, and having been indicted upon several statutes; and evi∣dence for proving matter of fact, being legal and sufficient, the case is now to be delivered to the great jury of trials,

<P>"THE present weak and shattered state of our CHURCHES, on the account of their Order, Government, and Discipline, (says Mr. <HI>White</HI>) is matter of LAMENTATION. This is evident to e∣very person of observation. Hence particular churches run into confusion. Many are aggrieved, and abide year after year in their sorrowful circumstances. And a farther evidence thereof, is the ineffectualness of councils to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦lieve the aggrieved, and to make peace. As also anti-councils, whereby contrary results are given on the same case, to the great reproach of councils, and blemish of our church government, and discouragement of the aggrieved, who are ready to lie under their troubles as remediless. Hence it is that some councils have perswaded the church and aggrieved, to promise to acquiesce in the determination of the council, before they heard the case, by which their consciences have been ensnared, and the council turned in∣to a solemn Arbitration. This therefore is matter of just Lamentation.</P>
<P>I come to enquire,</P>
<P N="1">1. Into the MEANS, which have brought us un∣der these lamentable circumstances. In a word, 'tis our being prejudiced against, and not attending to the rules and principles of congregational churches, as laid down in our platform. To go from the rule is arbitrary; and to go against professed principles, making our wills the rule, is tyranny. And when a people fairly possessed of liberties
<PB N="166" REF="012626_0165_0F8B8EA854299730"/>
and privileges, are thus dealt with, this leads directly to contention and confusion.</P>
<P N="1">1. These churches have not attended the rule, as to the compleat organization of churches. 'Tis the privi∣lege of a church to chuse its own officers; as, platform, chap. 10. sect. 5. viz. The power granted by Christ un∣to the body of the church and brotherhood, is a preroga∣tive and privilege which the church exerciseth, in chusing their own officers, whether elders or deacons, &amp;c. So ch. 6. sect. 4. Of elders some attend chiefly to the ministry of the word, as pastors and teachers; some attend especial∣ly unto rule, who are therefore called ruling-elders. Now the want of these officers exposes churches to arbitrariness, contentions and confusions. As also it renders the go∣vernment of the church, in some cases impracticable. An instance of all these great inconveniencies, we have lately had in a neighbour church; where all possible endeavors have been used by the aggrieved (a very great and valuable part of the church) to have a church-meeting, and when there was great occasion for it; and yet it could not be obtained: They had not a church-meeting for about 14 years: Whereas if they had been furnished with a full supply of officers, they might have easily obtained it, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that means put an end to a long and very threatning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tention. Besides, had the pastor called the church to∣gether at their request, there being but one elder, viz. a teaching one, and he the (supposed) offending party, it was not possible according to congregational principles, to have proceeded to judge and censure in that case. For ministers are under no ecclesiastic government, but in the church, where they are members as well as ministers. Now 'tis a rule in the congregational government, as in plat∣form, chap. 10. sect. 11. No church-act can be consumma∣ted or perfected, without the consent of both; that is, the eldership and brethren. Now tis not at all proper, that an accused and faulty elder should be a judge in his own case; therefore when he is the peccant party and no ruling elders to join the brethren in an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>act of discipline and censure, there cannot be a valid act. And so it is also when a minister is the accuser. Thus by the disuse of ruling el∣ders (so necessary in our constitution) the government is rendered weak; yea, in some cases impracticable. There∣fore it was that when the synod convened, <HI>Oct.</HI> 15, 1679,
<PB N="167" REF="012626_0166_0F8B8EA9229E1B38"/>
to enquire what wanted reformation in the land, and to propose expedients therefor; in the 5th place they say,
<Q>Tis requisite that the utmost endeavors should be used, in order for a full supply of officers in the churches, ac∣cording to Christ's institution; the defect of these chur∣ches on this account is very lamentable, there being in most of the churches only one teaching officer for the burthen of the whole church to lie upon. The Lord Christ would not have instituted pastors, teachers, ruling elders, (nor the apostles ordained elders in every church) Acts 4.23. Tit. 1.5. if he had not seen there was need of them for the good of his people; therefore for men to think they can do well enough without them, is to break the second commandment, and to reflect upon the wisdom of Christ, as if he did appoint unnecessary officers in his church. Experience hath evinced, that personal instruction and discipline have been happy means to reform degenerate congregations; yea, and owned by the Lord for the conversion of many souls. But where there are great congregations, it is impossible for one man besides his public labours, fully to attend those other things of great importance, and necessary to be done, in order to an effectual reformation of fami∣lies and congregations.</Q>
Thus the synod.</P>
<P N="2">2. Again, these churches have reduced their church-state to great darkness, by not attending the rule of our constitution in councils. It has been the practice of coun∣cils convened according to the second way of communion in our platform, who are only to hold forth light, and give advice, to usurp the power of judgment in matters of fact, as also the power of admonition, in case of offence. Which to do is proper to the third way of communion; and supposes that a church wants correction for an offence, and not merely light and counsel. And by this means the third way of communion has been shut out, and not practiced. This thing I am bold to say, has been the oc∣casion of all our anti-councils, as well as the contentions and confusions churches have been left in, after all endea∣vors used by neighbor churches, by way of councils.</P>
<P N="2">2. I come to the other thing remaining, and that is, the METHODS of our relief.</P>
<P>And here I would say,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let our churches be advised to get compleatly fur∣nished
<PB N="168" REF="012626_0167_0F8B8EA9DB728CE0"/>
with church-officers according to the platform. By this time I hope ye see the necessity of it. Arise, for this matter belongs to you; and tis just matter of offence if you neglect it any longer.</P>
<P>Remember, it is necessary in a congregational church: And the ministers and members of these churches would do well to get reconciled to every part, and branch of the constitution. Prejudices against, aversions and disaffecti∣ons to the same, have greatly threatened the utter dissolu∣tion of these churches. Our government is firm and strong; but if such as should keep it in good repair, do weaken it, it is in danger of falling to pieces. A brick house (be it never so firm) if every tenant takes out a brick, in time it will be weak, and shatter to pieces. But some objections offer, which it may be needful to remove.</P>
<P N="1">1. Obj. Our reverend pastors are against it, and think that the office is not of divine right.</P>
<P>Ans. 1. Ministers should reconcile themselves to the congregational government before they accept of the pas∣toral office in such a church.</P>
<P N="2">2. There are especially three scriptures, which may satisfy the scrupulous, as to the divine right of ruling el∣ders; as, Rom. 12.8. 1 Tim. 5.17. 1 Cor. 12.28. God has set in his church, governments. These are church governors and distinct from teachers; who else can they be but ruling elders? Let such as have any consciencious scruples in this affair, weigh in the ballance of the sanctua∣ry, the arguments brought for the divine right of ruling elders, in a book entitled, <HI>Jus Divinum Regiminis Ecclesi∣astici</HI>; as also a sheet not long since published, entitled, <HI>The Divine Right of Ruling Elders</HI>; as also, a rational and nervous letter lately published on this argument. Enough is said in these to satisfy an unprejudiced mind as to their divine right.</P>
<P N="3">3. 'Tis the right and privilege of the brethren to chuse their officers; and therefore if they be clear in the matter, they should not be discouraged or obstructed in the use of their just liberties.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the pastors will be so arbitrary, as utterly to re∣fuse to call the church together to chuse these officers; I suppose, the church may look upon themselves in that case, and so far, to be without a ruler; and may conve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for this purpose, as when they have no minister to chuse
<PB N="169" REF="012626_0168_0F8B8EAA8704D448"/>
one. It must be a great abuse of a minister's power, to obstruct the church in the exercise of that power or privi∣lege, Christ has given them, for the preservation of their peace and purity. Englishmen can't patiently submit to arbitrary measures. Two kings, within our memory, have smarted for attempting it. One lost his head, the other his empire. And will English Christians tamely submit thereto? Can they be easy, when those, who by divine appointment are to minister to them for their spiritual edi∣fication, Lord it over them who are God's heritage? 'Tis unreasonable for any to desire or expect it, and base for christians to submit to it.</P>
<P>Obj. 2. We would proceed to chuse ruling elders, if there were any men in the church fit for it.</P>
<P>Ans. 'Tis God's work to fit men for offices in church or state. 'Tis your duty to chuse such as are best qualified, and depend upon God farther and more fully to fit them. I remember, as introductory to our election of ruling el∣ders, near thirty years ago, I preached from those words, Num. 11.25. And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, (that is to Moses) and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it to the seventy elders.— There is the residue of the spirit to furnish for every office of trust, to which one and another is chosen. And in that the getting ruling elders was opposed by many in town and church, I preached another sermon from those words in 2 Tim. 2.25. In meekness instructing those that op∣pose themselves. Reformations are commonly attended with great oppositions. Lay aside then I pray, your ob∣jecting, and attend your duty.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let discipline be prudently, strictly, and impartially exercised in particular churches. Negligence and parti∣ality herein is very hurtful to the peace, purity, and growth of churches.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let councils move in their proper sphere: Let them act agreable to their nature, and the rules laid down in the platform. Let such as are called to give advice, and to hold forth light, do that; and proceed no further.</P>
<P N="4">4. Come into the practice of the third way of com∣munion, as laid down in the platform. When a church is rent with division among themselves, and lie under any open scandal, and yet refuse to consult with other churches
<PB N="170" REF="012626_0169_0F8B8EAB5E159578"/>
for healing and removing the same, this is matter of of∣fence; and the aggrieved making a complaint hereof to a particular church, this church is in a christian manner to make enquiry, and demand an account of the other church, in order to their conviction and admonition, if faulty; or in order to their vindication, if innocent: as in platform, chap. 15. There has been in times past, great oppositi∣on to the practice of this rule. But the late venerable council held at Salem, saw cause to countenance the prac∣tice of that way of the communion of churches, and advised the aggrieved there, in case they receive not speedy satis∣faction from the reverend pastor, pursuant to the result and advice of said council, to apply to a particular church in the neighbourhood for help, as directed in the third way of communion. Which thing I humbly apprehend will prove of greater service toward the establishing these chur∣ches, than any thing done for scores of years. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis that rule, and the wise practising it, that wipes off the raproach of independency from congregational churches. They are unaccountable, unless in this way.</P>
<P N="2">2. 'Tis this rule that preserves churches pure in their com∣munion one with another. For if a church gives offence, &amp; continues obstinate in any sinful way, and other churches held communion with such disorderly church, &amp; dont use all possible means to reclaim her, they are partakers of her sin. But there is no other regular way to enquire into her ad∣ministrations, to convince her, and admonish her, and se∣parate her from their communion, but this. Altho' one church has not authority over another, yet churches have power to preserve the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> purity, and to put a church obstinately offending out of their communion; or else they must hold fellowship with her in a sinful way.</P>
<P N="3">3. This rule is necessary to the peace of particular churches, as it will effectually relieve persons aggrieved. There can't much peace be expected where a great part of a church, are gauled by arbitrary measures. But in this way they must give satisfaction, or sustain the sentence of non-communion. And this opens a door for all aggrieved ones, to resettle in an orderly way, in stated fellowship in some neighbour church, as tho' they had been dismissed.</P>
<P N="4">4. This rule doth effectually hinder anti-councils, or having councils against councils; of which there have been too many instances, to the great reproach and con∣fusion
<PB N="171" REF="012626_0170_0F8B8EAC2E30D828"/>
of these churches. For if aggrieved persons are al∣lowed to call councils, the church has power and liberty to call them; and by this means, anti-councils come upon the stage. But if the aggrieved make complaint to a par∣ticular church, there is no possibility of anti-councils. Tis therefore mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h to be wondered at, that such mighty op∣position has been made against introducing this rule into practice in these churches. And tis matter of thankful∣ness that the way is prepared by the foresaid council at Salem, for the practice thereof.</P>
<P>Obj. It may be objected, this rule was not put in prac∣tice in the early days of these churches.</P>
<P>Ans. 1. Our fathers were but men, and had their de∣fects. Hence, though they in the synod declared so fully for the full supply of officers in the church; and this re∣sult of the synod was approved by the general court, re∣commending the same to the serious consideration of all the churches; yet how shamefully has this expedient for reformation been disregarded by most of our churches!</P>
<P N="2">2. I suppose the true reason why the third way of com∣munion was not practised in our early days, was because then there was little or no occasion for it; churches were more tender and willing to receive light, when offered by councils called in the second way of communion: And when it is thus, there is no room for the practice of this rule.</P>
<P>I shall add the following moving considerations.</P>
<P N="1">1. Our church-government is too good to be slighted and thrown away. I am persuaded 'tis nearer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he scrip∣ture and better warranted and supported by it, than any church government in the world.</P>
<P>As to the church of England, there is no scripture foun∣dation for their hierarchy, as, arch-bishops, lord-bishops▪ arch-deacons, officials, chancellors, &amp;c. Of late, by one and another masterly hand, the following truth has been set in so clear a light, that none but the wilfully ignorant can resist it, viz. That the scripture bishop, is no other than the pastor of a particular church. And it is an inno∣vation and usurpation, that they are dignified as they are in the church of England. Besides, to take out of the hands of the presbyters or pastors all rule in the church, is unscriptural; for what is more plain, than that they who watch for souls, are to rule over them also? as Heb. 13.17. Their taking away from churches the liberty of
<PB N="172" REF="012626_0171_0F8B8EACD8A19E48"/>
chusing their own officers, is an intollerable invasion of the right of churches, as well as their introducing many unscriptural ceremonies into divine worship.</P>
<P>Again, the presbyterian government, I grant, has been accompanied with eminent holiness; as witness the church of Scotland, Geneva, and many other reformed churches. And I acknowledge there is but little difference between them and us; especially, if we have ruling elders, and practise the third way of communion. Yet wherein we differ, I am humbly of opinion we have the scripture on our side. Let any if they can, give a genuine interpreta∣tion of the 1 Cor. 5 chap. and ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lude the brethren from having any hand in church discipline and censures. Be∣sides what is written, Mat. 18. Tell it to the church; that is say they, to the ministers. This is to put the scripture upon the rack, to make it speak what we would have it. Let us then be thankful for our constitution; strictly ad∣here to and practise it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our church-government, if strictly adhered to, will effectu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly answer all the intentions of government. There is no member in a church, no church in the whole conso∣ciation of churches, tho' never so stubborn and obstinate, but must submit, or sustain the dreadful sentence of non-communion: which methinks no good minister and chris∣tian can make light of.</P>
<P>I shall conclude the whole with a few words further by way of advice or counsel.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us be very thankful to God, who has hitherto secured for us our civil and sacred privileges; notwith∣standing our great barrenness and unprofitableness, yea, and our many and great provocations. God is slow unto anger, and abundant in goodness and kindness. We have for an 100 years enjoyed the dispensation of the glorious gospel, in its power and purity, and free from persecution. What could God have done for this his vineyard, which he has not done, in order to our fruitfulness?</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us be warned against withdrawing from the fel∣lowship of these churches, until we find more pure chur∣ches and worship; and of a more scriptural faith and or∣der. Such as break with, and break off from these chur∣ches, because their stubborn wills will not submit to the just and regular censures of the church to which they be∣long; or because they cant have their will, as to the place
<PB N="173" REF="012626_0172_0F8B8EADB1DC4840"/>
of their worship; these deserve the character of heady and high-minded. And if their unreasonable desires are re∣strained by the civil government, then they will turn churchmen. Surely such church-men are guilty of will-worship with a witness. These converts are worthy to be called children of Belial, who rise up against lawful autho∣rity, and take sanctuary in the church. The church of England doth too much honor our churches, when they ac∣count those worthy of their fellowship, who are worthy to be rejected by us. I would wisper in the ears of these thoughtless and unnatural converts, not to say apostates; will you rashly, and to have your wills in lesser matters, re∣turn to a state of bondage, when you enjoy matchless li∣berties and privileges? Will you take upon you a yoke which your gracious predecessors could not bear? Will you bring a burd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en upon posterity, which is intollerable, to humour and ease yourselves? Know, when the yoke is once on your necks, you must pay the tythe, the tenth part of which you are apt now to think is too much for you to give, or your minister to receive. And do you think the vast arrearages will not be recovered, one way or other? I mean the vast sums expended for the propa∣gation of the gospel; that is, for the bringing over our churches to the mother church.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be kind to your ministers; and dont give them any just provocation to desert you, or to endeavor to reconcile themselves to the discipline and ceremonies of the church. The discount of the bills of credit has insensibly and ex∣ceedingly hurt them in times past; and it is well if it be not so to this day with some. I am fully persuaded that ministers salaries ought in justice to be raised nearly in pro∣portion to the depreciation of the bills of credit; for the price of the necessaries of life rise in proportion. By no means discourage the hearts, or weaken the hands of your faithful ministers, who are willing to spend and be spent, in the service of your precious souls. Especially be cauti∣ous at this juncture, when so great temptations are laid be∣fore them to desert you, and go home and take orders.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, and finally, Study the principles of your faith and order; be heartily reconciled to, and be zealous in the defence and practice of them. And as often as any of our holy churches do want a pastor, I would advise them when treating with any candidate in order to settlement,
<PB N="174" REF="012626_0173_0F8B8EAFE3B5AD88"/>
to know his mind with respect to the professed faith and order of these churches; and proceed not to election; un∣til he has given his assent to the one, and his promise to practise according to the other. This indeed is implicitly done by his acceptance of the invitation of a congregatio∣nal church; but the more explicit, the better. And when the elders and messengers of neighbour-churches are (upon invitation) convened, to assist in the solemn separa∣tion of a pastor to the sacred work of the gospel-ministry, in his ordination; they would doubtless do well to satisfy themselves in these things, lest they be found to lay their hands too suddenly upon his head.</P>
<P>To conclude, Let us then stand fast in the liberties wherewith Christ hath made us free, Gal. 5.1. Our country thinks it worth while to spend many thousands, in defence of their civil privileges, settled upon us by charter; and are not these sacred privileges of equal, yea of greatter worth and value? O then let us contend ear∣nestly for the faith and order of the gospel, lest we be found to despise our birth-right, and to destroy ourselves."</P>

<HEAD>REASONS For adhering to our PLATFORM, as a Rule of Church-Government, and Objections against Ruling ELDERS answered. In a Letter to a Friend. By another Hand.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received a message from you, that a friend of yours desires to have some reasons (drawn up in writing) to shew why we should adhere to the PLATFORM as a rule of church-government, at least till another &amp; better be provided. I wish a better head were employed in assign∣ing reasons for it: But to gratify you (in the interim) I shall give you the general reasons inducing me to be of the opinion that we ought so to do. But first I premise, that whereas it is objected, That the scriptures are the only rule both of worship and discipline, and that it is both sinful and dangerous to set up human composures as our rule; I perfectly agree with the objectors and acknowledge that no human composure ought to be received, which disagrees with the holy scriptures. But if the platform must be rejected merely because it is of human compo∣sure; then by the same parity of reason, not only the as∣sociation principles, but also all sermons, confessions of faith, creeds, catechisms, and the like, are to be rejected, these being also human composures. And it is very observable that the same persons who are for rejecting the platform, would at the same time have us subject to such a govern∣ment as they themselves shall from time to time fancy to be agreable to the scriptures; not allowing us to judge for ourselves, whether it be agreable to the scripture or not; nor willing to be governed or restricted themselves by any rule, except the scriptures in the sense they them∣selves understand them, or (which is one and the same thing) by any other than what agrees with their own senti∣ments. And with this allowance I suppose the Pope him∣self could comply with the scripture as the rule of his government.</P>
<P>But that there ought to be a platform extracted from the Holy scriptures, as a particular rule of church-govern∣ment, and that it is our wisdom and interest to adhere to ours, at least till another and better be provided, is evi∣dent to me, from the following considerations, viz.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="176" REF="012626_0175_0F8B8EB154662718"/>1. The nature, use and ends of all government neces∣sarily imply ORDER: Order cannot be preserved without known and certain rules: The duties of rulers and ruled must be stated, circumscribed, and limited by a rule; other∣wise rulers may be tyrants at pleasure, and subjects rebel whenever they have opportunity, and neither of them be accountable.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tho' the scriptures are in themselves a perfect rule, and the only standard by which all other rules are to be tried; yet it is evident that through the darkness or cor∣ruption of men's minds, this rule is very diversly under∣stood and practised upon, both with respect to doctrine and discipline. Hence the authors of the most corrupt doctrines pretend to the scriptures to support their tenets. So with respect to church-government, the congregati∣onalist, the presbyterian, the episcopalian, yea, and even the papist, pretend to rule and govern according to the scripture. So that they don't so much differ upon the question, whether the scripture shall be the rule, as upon the question, how the scripture is to be understood; or what is agreable and what contrary to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence it follows, that without some platform or con∣stitution, there can be no orderly government upheld. This appears to be agreable to the sense both of papists &amp; protestants, episcopalians, presbyterians and congregationa∣lists; who all have their platforms or constitutions of church-government.</P>
<P N="4">4. The church-government in this country is founded upon a particular compact or agreement: wherein the officers and members of each particular church combine to set forward the worship of God, and maintain the discipline of his kingdom, in a way which they judge to be agreable to the Holy Scriptures; and to act in way of consociation with other churches of the same principles, for their mu∣tual good and edification. 'Upon this foundation were the churches of New-England first settled; and for their more regular proceeding therein the platform (expressing their sense of the scripture relating to church order and govern∣ment) was composed and consented to by the churches in our primitive times: And this form of government is so far established, that our general consent to continue and abide in this way, would secure to us the privileges of it. And this indeed is our only barrier against episcopacy; unless some other form of government (not disallowed by
<PB N="177" REF="012626_0176_0F8B8EB209552CE8"/>
the crown) be received and embraced by the churches.</P>
<P N="5">5. But if we slight the method of government in our platform, and don't by agreement fix on another, it will follow, that either the government of the church must cease, or a government imposed and enforced by human laws must succeed. I presume most certainly, the churches (so unhinged) must immediately fall into an absolute inde∣pendency at first: and the members of each individual church, must either be allowed to be under no government but what will suit with their own private judgment on the scriptures (which they may be tempted to vary or alter as occasion may offer;) or else a power of judging for them∣selves as to the meaning of the scripture must be denied to the brethren, and put over to the minister for him to judge and determine as he thinks fit, and to state and fix the boundaries both of his own authority and the people's obedience, as he shall from time to time understand the scripture. And who can tell how much or how often his judgment may also vary, upon occasions or temptations which may offer? But such a confused state of things can't last long; a more certain and regular form of govern∣ment will quickly be found necessary; and perhaps a presbyterian government may be sought after, but not found to be attainable. May it not therefore be proper (before we part with our platform) not only to enquire whether the presbyterian constitution be more agreable to the scripture; but also whether that government can be set up and supported here, unless some other laws than we have hitherto had, be enacted, and do obtain the royal appro∣bation. That the royal approbation may be obtained in favor of the way of the church of England, can't be doubt∣ed; but that it will be obtained in favor of a presbyterian church government here, seems hardly probable: which if duly considered, it may well be wondered how gentle∣men (who would not be willing that themselves or posteri∣ty should be placed under episcopacy) can think of depart∣ing from our own platform; at least till another and bet∣ter be instituted in the room thereof.</P>
<P N="6">6. Our platform was doubtless the result of great tho't and deliberation, and of earnest prayer and supplication; composed and consented to by men of as great learning, piety and prudence as any our age affords; and such as had
<PB N="178" REF="012626_0177_0F8B8EB2CD059288"/>
more knowledge and larger experience of the state of the church at home and abroad, than perhaps any among us of the present age have; and as careful of avoiding human inventions as the best of us. Now the platform agreed with their understanding of the scripture, not only then, but many years after, when it was revised by a succeeding sy∣nod. And I am perswaded, if it were now impartially considered and compared with the scripture, it would be found very consonant therewith. And even that part there∣of which asserts the office of the ruling elder (which is as I suppose the most distastful, to such as would explode the platform) agrees with the scripture not only in the judgment of the divines and churches in New-England in our purest times; but also in the judgment of the most famous reforming divines and churches that have been in other parts of the world. Both the necessity and divine authority of that office having been asserted by divines vastly more in number than those (among presbyterians and congregationalists) who do or have decried it; and not inferior to them in learning, piety or solid judgment. I am told by a gentleman of learning and ingenuity, That the protestant churches of Geneva, France, Scotland, Holland, and in general almost all the churches of the re∣formation (except episcopalians) have upheld this office; and that it has never been denied by any considerable num∣ber of protestant churches (exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt as aforesaid) till that about the space of fifty years ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a number of ministers rose up in New-England, who did oppose it.</P>
<P>Upon the whole therefore, tho' no man's conscience ought to be bound by this or any other platform, in any matter which he verily believes to be contrary to the scripture; yet it seems impossible to conceive, how a particular church can uphold an orderly discipline, or a number of churches form a consociation, unless they do unite in the foundation-principles of church-government; or that the civil authority prescribe the rules or canons of church-go∣vernment, and enforce obedience, and subjection thereto, as in the case of national churches.</P>
<P>From the foregoing considerations laid together, I think it will appear to be the wisdom and interest of all those who prefer our own constitution before a national church government, and its forcing canons, steadily to adhere to our platform; at least till another and better be found,
<PB N="179" REF="012626_0178_0F8B8EB398F51960"/>
and (after mature consideration) consented to and agreed upon by the churches.</P>
<P>And now because the office of a ruling elder is an essen∣tial branch of congregational church-government, which if left out, quite alters the constitution, and changes the government of the church into a monarchical form; and because I apprehend that the prejudices that are taken against the platform, are principally upon this head; I would now acquaint your friend (tho' this is further than his request expresses) upon what grounds I satisfy my self respecting the objections I meet with against that office.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whereas it is objected, That the generality of our ministers do not hold this office to be of divine institution: to this objection I oppose the judgment of formor divines (more in number, and not less capable of judging as to the meaning of the scriptures;) as also the judgment of several divines now living among us.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whereas'tis objected, that according to Eph.IV.8.11.12. the ordinary officers left by Christ in the church, are only pastors and teachers; and according to Phil. 1.1. bishops (or pastors) and deacons are the only officers mentioned: I satisfy my self as to this objection, by con∣sidering that the word bishop, pastor and shepherd, signify one and the same thing whenever applied to ecclesiastical officers; and imply a power af teaching, overseeing, feed∣ing and governing. The word pastor is applicable to all rulers whether civil or ecclesiastical, and is so used in scripture; and tho' the word bishop seems in a more ap∣propriated sense to belong to the ecclesiastical ruler; yet under that word so appropriated are comprehended all ecclesiastical rulers, guides, overseers, shepherds; even as the word magistrate comprehends all civil rulers of every rank and station. So that neither of these expressions do exclude any sort of elder, overseer or ruler in the church; but on the contrary do include and comprehend them all. And tho' a power of teaching, overseeing and ruling, may all be attributed to one man; yet it does not follow that the power of overseeing and ruling must lie solely and ab∣solutely in him. For there may be, and is, a government, where there is not a lordly power, or (which is the same thing) power in a single officer, which has no other branch of government to check and controul it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whereas 'tis objected, That we have not men capa∣ble, &amp;c. If it be so indeed, that there are no men in our
<PB N="180" REF="012626_0179_0F8B8EB49E5895D0"/>
churches, that have skill enough or integrity enough to guide in the external administrations of the government and discipline of the church; and capable too of assisting, directing, exhorting and comforting their brethren, as they may have opportunity; our degeneracy is very lamen∣table indeed. Our churches have then none suitable for service in ecclesiastical councils. Every thing at home and abroad must be left to the prudence and fidelity of the ministers; and wo to that church (if such a thing shou'd bappen) that falls under the influence of a minister no bet-qualified than themselves.</P>
<P N="4">4. I find an assertion in a late printed pamphlet, that the keys of doctrine and discipline were committed to the apostles. And again, To be sure to the same persons is there committed the ruling and feeding of the flock. The author refers to the last chapter of Matthew. But would he restrain the power of ruling to the persons of the apostles or to the persons of gospel ministers as their suc∣cessors in the work of teaching and baptizing, and to them only; he must then either prove the government of the church to be monarchical, or else that every church is obliged to provide a number of such teaching elders.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another objection is, That if we will have ruling elders, we must provide them a maintainance; and this, some suppose, would fright us out of the notion of such of∣ficers. But to me it appears no ways formidable. For in the first place, I don't believe that double honor princi∣pally intends maintainance (as some would have it, from 1 Tim. 5.17.) and the next words proves no more than this, that a suitable reward is due, according to the labour performed. It therefore remains to be proved, that a ruling elder must spend his whole time in the service of the church, before he is entitled to a maintainance from the church. But if a suitable and honorable reward were as∣signed in proportion to their service, I believe no body would have reason to complain; and abundance of good might be done, and evil prevented, by their prudent la∣bours, which would take up no great quantity of time. And in extraordinary matters, I see no reason but their la∣bors should be handsomely rewarded. Submitting the whole to the censure of your friend, (unknown to me) I rest</P>

<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE setting forth of the publick confession of the faith of churches hath a double end, and both tend∣ing to public edification: First, the maintenance of the faith intire within itself: Secondly, the holding, forth of unity and harmony, both amongst, and with o∣ther churches. Our churches here, as (by the grace of Christ) we believe and profess the same doctrine of the truth of the gospel, which generally is received in all the reformed churches of Christ in Europe, so especially we desire not to vary from the doctrine of faith and truth held forth by the churches of our native country. For though it be not one native country that can breed us all of one mind; nor ought we to have the glorious faith of our Lord Jesus with respect to persons, yet as <HI>Paul,</HI> who was himself a Jew, professed to hold forth the doctrine of justi∣fication by faith, and of the resurrection of the dead, ac∣cording as he knew his godly country-men did, who were Jews by nature, (<HI>Gal</HI> 2.15. <HI>Acts</HI> 26.6, 7.) so we who are by nature English-men, do desire to hold forth the same doctrine of religion (especially in fundamentals) which we see and know to be held by the churches of <HI>England,</HI> according to the truth of the gospel.</P>
<P>The more we discern (that which we do, and have cause to do with incessant mourning and trembling) the unkind, and unbrotherly, and unchristian contention of our godly brethren and country-men in matters of church government; the more earnestly do we desire to see them join together in one common faith; and ourselves with them. For this end, having perused the public confession of the faith, agreed upon by the reverend assembly of di∣vines at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and finding the sum and substance thereof (in matters of doctrine) to express not their own judgment only, but ours also; and being likewise called upon by our godly magistrates, do draw up a public con∣fession of that faith which is constantly taught, and gene∣rally professed amongst us; we thought good to present unto them, and with them to our churches; and with
<PB N="184" REF="012626_0183_0F8B8EB9AABFF458"/>
them to all the churches of Christ abroad, our professed and hearty assent and attestation to the whole confession of faith (for substance of doctrine) which the reverend assem∣bly presented to the religious and honorable parliment of <HI>England</HI>: Excepting only some sections in the 25, 30. &amp; 31. chapters of their confession, which concerns points of controversy in church discipline; touching which we refer ourselves to the draught of church discipline in the en∣suing treatise.</P>
<P>The truth of what we here declare, may appear by the unanimous vote of the synod of the elders and messengers of our churches, assembled at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the last of the sixth month, 1648, which jointly passed in these words; This synod having perused and considered (with much gladness of heart, and thankfulness to God) the confession of faith published of late by the reverend assembly in <HI>En∣gland,</HI> do judge it to be very holy, orthodox and judicious in all matters of faith; and do therefore freely and fully consent thereunto, for the substance thereof. Only in those things which have respect to church-government and discipline, we refer ourselves to the platform of church-dis∣cipline, agreed upon by this present assembly; and do therefore think it meet, that this confession of faith should be commended to the churches of Christ, and to the honor∣ed court, as worthy of their due consideration &amp; acceptance. Howbeit, we may not conceal, that the doctrine of vocati∣on, expressed in chap. 10. sect. 1. and summarily repeated in chap. 13. sect. 1. passed not without some debate. Yet considering the term of vocation, and others by which it is described, are capable of a large, or more strict sense and use, and that it is not intended to bind apprehensions pre∣cisely in point of order or method, there hath been a gene∣ral condescendency thereunto.</P>
<P>Now by this our professed consent and free concurrence with them in all the doctrinals of religion, we hope it may appear to the world, that as we are a remnant of the peo∣ple of the same nation with them, so we are professors of the same common faith, and fellow-heirs of the same common salvation. Yea moreover, as this our profession of the same faith with them, will exempt us (even in their judgments) from suspicion of heresy; so (we trust) it may exempt us in the like sort from suspicion of schism: that though we are forced to dissent from them in matters of
<PB N="185" REF="012626_0184_0F8B8EBA44CCBAB0"/>
church-discipline, yet our dissent is not taken up out of ar∣rogancy of spirit in ourselves (whom they see willingly condescend to learn of them) neither is it carried with un∣charitable consoriousness towards them, (both which are the proper and essential characters of schism) but in meek∣ness of wisdom, as we walk along with them, and follow them as they follow Christ; so where we conceive a diffe∣rent apprehension of the mind of Christ (as it falleth out in some few points touching church-order) we still reserve due reverence to them (whom we judge to be, through Christ, the glorious lights of both nations) and only crave leave (as in the spirit we are bound) to follow the Lamb with∣ersoever he goeth, and (after the apostles example) as we believe, so we speak.</P>
<P>And if the example of such poor out-casts as ourselves might prevail, if not with all (for that were too great a blessing to hope for) yet with some or other of our breth∣ren in <HI>England,</HI> so far as they are come to mind and speak the same thing with such as dissent from them, we hope in Christ it would not only moderate the harsh judging and condemning of one another in such differences of judg∣ment as may be found in the choicest saints; but also pre∣vent (by the mercy of Christ) the peril of the distraction and destruction of all churches in both kingdoms. Other∣wise, if brethren shall go on to bite and devour one ano∣ther, the apostle feared (as we also with sadness of heart do) it will tend to the consuming of them, and us all: which the Lord prevent.</P>
<P>We are not ignorant, (that besides these aspersions of heresy and schism) other exceptions also are taken at our way of church-government, (but as we conceive) upon as little grounds. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. That by admitting none into the fellowship of our church but saints by calling, we rob many parish churches of their best members, to make up one of our congregati∣ons, which is not only to gather churches out of churches, (a thing unheard of in scripture) but also to weaken the hearts and hands of the best ministers in the parishes, by despoiling them of their best hearers.</P>
<P N="2">2. That we provide no course for the gaining and call∣ing in of ignorant, and erroneous, and scandalous persons,
<PB N="186" REF="012626_0185_0F8B8EBC69E7D050"/>
whom we refuse to receive into our churches, and so ex∣clude from the wholsome remedy of church-discipline.</P>
<P N="3">3. That in our way we sow seeds of division, and hin∣drance of edification in every family; whilst admitting in∣to churches only voluntaries, the husband will be of one church, the wife of another; the parents of one church, the children of another; the master of one church, the ser∣vants of another. And so the parents and masters being of different churches from their children and servents, they cannot take a just account of their profiting by what they hear; yea, by this means the husbands, parents and masters shall be chargeable to the maintenance of many other churches, and church-officers, besides their own; which will prove a charge and burthen unsupportable.</P>
<P>But for answer, as to the first; for gathering churches out of churches, we cannot say that it is a thing unheard of in scripture. The first christian church was gathered out of the Jewish church, and out of many synagogues in that church, and consisted partly of the inhabitants of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and partly of the <HI>Galileans</HI>; who though they kept some communion in some part of publick wor∣ship with the temple, yet neither did they frequent the sacrifices, nor repair to the sanhedrim for the determining of their church causes, but kept intire aad constant com∣munion with the apostles church in all the ordinances of the gospel. And for the first christian church of the Gentiles at <HI>Antioch,</HI> it appeareth to have been gathered and constituted partly of the dispersed brethren of the church at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> (whereof some were men of <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Cyrene</HI>) and partly of the believing Gentiles. <HI>Acts.</HI> 11.20, 21.</P>
<P>If it be said, the first christian church at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and that at <HI>Antioch,</HI> were gathered not out of any christian church, but of the Jewish temple and synagogues, which were shortly after to be abolished: and their gathering to <HI>Antioch</HI> was upon occasion of dispersion in time of per∣secution,</P>
<P>We desire it may be considered, 1. That the members of the Jewish church were more strongly and straitly tied by express holy covenant, to keep fellowship with the Jewish church till it was abolished, than any members of christian parish churches are wont to be tied to keep fel∣lowship with their parish churches. The episcopal canons, which bind them to attend on their parish church, it is
<PB N="187" REF="012626_0186_0F8B8EBC9607B1B8"/>
likely they are now abolished with the episcopacy. The common law of the land is satisfied (as we conceive) if they attend upon the worship of God in any other church, though not within their own parish. But no such like covenant of God, nor any other religious tie lieth upon them to attend the worship of God in their own parish church, as did lie upon the Jews to attend upon the wor∣ship of God in their temple and synagogues.</P>
<P N="2">2. Though the Jewish temple church at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was to be abolished, yet that doth not make the desertion of it by the members to be lawful, till it was abolished. Fu∣ture abolition is no warrant for present desertion, unless it be lawful, in some case, whilst the church is yet in pre∣sent standing, to desert it; to wit, either for avoiding pre∣sent polutions, or for hope of greater edification, and so for better satisfaction to conscience in either. Future e∣vents, or foresight of them do not dissolve present relati∣ons, else wives, children, servants, might desert their hus∣bands, parents, masters, when they be mortally sick.</P>
<P N="3">3. What the members of the Jewish church did, in joining to the church at <HI>Antioch</HI> in time of persecution, it may well be conceived the members of any christian church may do the like for satisfaction of conscience. Peace of conscience is more desirable than the peace of the outward man; and freedom from scruples of conscience is more comfortable to a sincere heart, than freedom from persecution.</P>
<P>If it be said, these members of the christian church at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> that joined to the church at <HI>Antioch,</HI> removed their habitations together with their relations; which if the brethren of the congregational way would do, it would much abate the grievance of their departure from their presbyterial churches.</P>
<P>We verily could wish them so to do, as well approving the like removal of habitation, in case of changing church relations (provided that it may be done without too much detriment to their outward estates) and we for our parts have done the same. But to put a necessity of removal of habitation in such a case, it is to foment and cherish a cor∣rupt principle of making a civil co-habitation, if not a formal cause, yet at least a proper adjunct of church re∣lation, which the truth of the gospel doth not acknow∣ledge. Now to fom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt an error to the prejudice of the
<PB N="188" REF="012626_0187_0F8B8EBD72AC1778"/>
truth of the gospel, is not to walk with a right foot, ac∣cording to the truth of the gospel, as <HI>Paul</HI> judgeth, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 1.</P>
<P N="4">4. We do not think it meet or fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, for a member of a presbyterial church forth with to desert his relation to his church, betake himself to the fellowship of a congregation∣al church, though he may discern some defect in the estate or government of his own. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Faithfulness of brotherly love in church-rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, re∣quireth that the members of the church should first con∣vince their brethren of their sinful defects, and duly wait for their reformation, before they depart from them. For if we must take such a course for the healing of a private brother, in a way of brotherly love, with much meekness and patience; how much more ought we so to walk with like tenderness towards a whole church.</P>
<P>Again, 2. By the hasty departure of sound members from a defective church, reformation is not promoted, but many times retarded, and corruption increased. Where∣as on the contrary, while sincere members breathing after purity of reformation abide together, they may (by the blessing of God upon their faithful endeavors prevail much with their elders and neighbours towards a reformation, it may be so much as that their elders in their own church shall receive none to the seals but visible saints; and in the classis shall put forth no authoritative act (but consultative only) touching the members of other churches, not touching their own, but with the consent (silent consent at least) of their own church. Which two things, if they can obtain with any humble, meek, holy, faithful endeavors, we con∣ceive they might (by the grace of Christ) find liberty of conscience to continue their relation with their own pres∣byterial church without scruple.</P>
<P N="5">5. But to add a word further, touching the gathering of churches out of churches: what if there were no express example of such a thing extant in the scriptures? That which we are wont to answer the antipaedo-baptists, may suf∣fice here: It is enough, if any evidence thereof may be ga∣thered from just consequence of scripture-light. Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> his judgment concerning this case passeth (for ought we know) without exception, which he gave in his fourth look of conscience, in answer to two questions, chap. 14. num. 16. If any (saith he) wronged with unjust vexation,
<PB N="189" REF="012626_0188_0F8B8EBE086D3618"/>
or providing for his own edification, or in testimony against sin, depart from a church, where some evils are tolerated, and join himself to another more pure, yet without con∣demning of the church he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leaveth, he is not therefore to be held as a schismatic, or as guilty of any other sin.</P>
<P>Where the tripartite disjunction which the judicious doctor putteth, declareth the lawfulness of the departure of a church member from his church, when either through weariness of unjust vexation, or in way of provision for his own edification, or in testimony against sin, he joineth him∣self to another congregation more reformed; any one of these he judgeth a lawful cause of departure, tho' all of them do not concur together. Neither will such a practice despoil the best ministers of the parishes of their best hearers.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. Sometimes the ministers themselves are willing to join with their better sort of hearers in this way of refor∣mation, and then they and their hearers continue still their church relation together; yea, and confirm it more straitly and strongly, by an express renewed covenant, tho' the ministers may still continue their wonted preaching to the whole parish.</P>
<P N="2">2. If the ministers do dislike the way of those whom they otherwise count their best members, and so refuse to join with them therein; yet if those members can procure some other ministers to join with them in their own way, and still continue their dwelling together in the same town, they may easily order the times of the public assembly, as to attend constantly upon the ministry of their former church, and either after or before the public assembly of the parish, take an opportunity to gather together for the administra∣tion of the sacraments and censures, and other church-ordinances amongst themselves. The first apostolic church assembled to hear the word with the Jewish church in the open courts of the temple, but afterwards gathered toge∣ther for breaking of bread, and other acts of church or∣der, from house to house.</P>
<P N="3">3. Suppose presbyterial churches should communicate some of their best gifted members towards the erecting &amp; gather∣ing another church, it would not forthwith be their detri∣ment, but may be their enlargement. It is the most noble &amp; perfect work of a living creature (both in nature and grace) to propagate and multiply his kind; and it is the honor
<PB N="190" REF="012626_0189_0F8B8EC046EB4D20"/>
of the faithful spouse of Christ to set forward the work of Christ as well abroad as at home. The church in Cant. 8.8. to help forward her little sister church was willing to part with her choice materials, even beams of cedar, and such precious living stones as were fit to build a silver palace. In the same book the church is sometimes com∣pared to a garden, sometimes to an orchard, Cant. 4.12, 13. No man planteth a garden or orchard, but seeketh to get the choicest herbs and plants of his neighbours, and they freely impart them; nor do they account it a spoil to their garden and orchard, but rather a glory. Neverthe∣less, we go not so far, we neither seek nor ask the choice members of the parishes, but accept them being of∣fered.</P>
<P>If it be said, They are not offered by the ministers, nor by the parish churches (who have most right in them) but only by themselves,</P>
<P>It may justly be demanded, what right or what power have either the ministers or parish church over them? Not by solemn church government, for that, tho' it be the firmest engagement is not owned, but rejected. If it be their joining with the parish in calling and election of a minister to such a congregation at his first coming, there is indeed just weight in such an engagement; nor do we judge it safe for such to remove from such a minister, unless it be upon such grounds as may justly give him due satis∣faction. But if the union of such members to a parish-church, and to the ministry thereof, be only by co-habi∣tation within the precincts of the parish, that union, as it was founded upon human law, so by human law it may easily be released. Or otherwise, if a man remove his habitation, he removeth also the bond of his relation, and the ground of offence.</P>
<P N="4">4. It need not be fear'd that all the best hearers of the best ministers, no, nor the most of them will depart from them upon point of church government. Those who have found the presence and power of the spirit of Christ breathing in their ministers, either to their conversion or edification, will be slow to change such a ministry of faith and holiness, for the liberty of church-order. Upon which ground, and sundry other such like, there be, doubtless, sundry godly and judicious hearers in many parishes in England, that do and will prefer their relation to their minis∣ters
<PB N="191" REF="012626_0190_0F8B8EC0AC1C9270"/>
(though in a presbyterial way) above the congregation∣al confederation.</P>
<P N="5">5. But if all, or the most part of the best hearers of the best ministers of parishes should depart from them, as preferring in their judgment, the congregational way, yet in case the congregational way should prove to be of Christ, it will never grieve the holy hearts of godly ministers, that their hearers should follow Christ; yea many of them∣selves (upon due deliberation) will be ready to go along with them. It never grieved nor troubled <HI>John Baptist</HI> that his disciples departed from him to follow after Christ, John 3. But if the congregational way should prove to be, not the institution of Christ (as we take it) but the inven∣tion of men, then doubtless the presbyterial form (if it be of God) will swallow up the other, as Moses's rod devour∣ed the rods of the Egyptians. Nor will this put a necessity upon both the opposite parties to shift for themselves, and seek to supplant one another, but only it will call upon them <HI>(Aletheuein en agape)</HI> to seek and follow the truth in love, to attend in faithfulness each unto his own flock, and to administer to them all the holy things of God, and their portion of food in due season; and as for others, quietly to forbear them, and yet to instruct them with meekness, that are contrary minded, leaving it to Christ (in the use of all good means) to reveal his own truth in his own time, and mean while endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, Phil. 3.15.16. Eph. 4.3.</P>
<P>To the 2d exception, that we take no course for the gaining, and healing, and calling in of ignorant and erro∣neous persons, whom we refuse to receive into our churches, and so exclude them from the remedy of church-discipline.</P>
<P>We conceive the receiving of them into our churches, would rather lose and corrupt our churches, than gain and heal them. A little leaven laid in a lump of dough, will sooner leaven the whole lump, than the whole lump will sweeten it. We find it therefore safer to square rough and unhewn stones before they be laid into the building, rather than to hammer and hew them when they lie unevenly in the building. And accordingly two means we use to gain and call in such as are ignorant and scandalous.</P>
<P N="1">1. The public ministry of the word, upon which they
<PB N="192" REF="012626_0191_0F8B8EC10C047A20"/>
are invited by counsel, and required by wholesome laws. And the word it is, which is the power of God to salva∣tion, to the calling and winning of souls.</P>
<P N="2">2. Private conference, and conviction by the elders, and other able brethren of the church, whom they do the more respectively hearken unto, when they see no hope of enjoying church-fellowship, or participation in the sa∣craments for themselves or their children, till they approve their judgments to be sound and orthodox, and their lives subdued to some hope of a godly conversation. What can classical discipline, or excommunication itself do more in this case.</P>
<P>The third exception wrapeth up in it a three-fold domes∣tical inconvenience, and each of them meet to be eschewed. 1. Dis-union in families between each relation. 2. Dis∣appointment of edification, for want of opportunity in the governors of families to take account of things heard by their children and servants. 3. Disbursements of chargea∣ble maintenance to the several churches, whereunto the several persons of their families are joined.</P>
<P>All which inconveniencies either do not fall out in con∣gregational churches, or are easily redressed; for none are orderly admitted into congregational churches, but such as are well approved by good testimony to be duly observant of family-relation: or if any otherwise disposed should creep in, they are either orderly healed, or duly removed in a way of Christ. Nor are they admitted, un∣less they can give some good account of their profiting by ordinances, before the elders and brethren of the church, and much more to their parents and masters. Godly, tu∣tors in the university can take an account of their pupils; and godly housholders in the city can take an account of their children and servants, how they profit by the word they have heard in several churches, and that to the greater edification of the whole family, by the variety of such administrations. Bees may bring more honey and wax into the hive, when they are not limited to one garden of flowers, but may fly abroad to many.</P>
<P>Nor is any charge expected from wives, children or ser∣vants to the maintenance of congregational churches, fur∣ther than they be furnished with personal estates or livings, which may enable them to contribute of such things as they have; and not of such things as they
<PB N="193" REF="012626_0192_0F8B8EC1D4ABFA18"/>
have not. God accepteth not robbery for a sacrifice. And though a godly housholder may justly take himself bound in conscience to contribute to any such church, whereto his wife, or children, or servants do stand in relation, yet that will not aggravate the burthen of his charge no more than if they were received members of the same church whereto himself is related.</P>
<P>But why do we stand thus long to plead exemptions from exception? The Lord help all his faithful servants (whether presbyterial or congregational) to judge and shame ourselves before the Lord, for all our former com∣pliances to greater enormities in church government, than are to be found either in the congregational or presbyteri∣al way; and then surely either the Lord will clear up his own will to us, and so frame and subdue us all to one mind and one way, (Ezek. 43.10.11.) or else we shall learn to bear one anothers burthens in a spirit of meekness. It will then doubtless be far from us, so to attest the dis∣cipline of Christ, as to detest the disciples of Christ: so to contend for the seamless coat of Christ, as to crucify the living members of Christ; so to divide ourselves about church-communion, as thro' breaches to open a wide gap for a deluge of anti-christian, and profane malignity to swallow up both church and civil state.</P>
<P>What shall we say more? Is difference of church order become the in-let of all the disorders in the kingdom? Hath the Lord indeed left us to such hardness of heart, that church-government shall become a snare to Zion (as sometimes Moses was to Egypt, Exod. 20.7.) that we cannot leave contesting and contending about it, till the kingdom be destroyed? Did not the Lord Jesus, when he dedicated his sufferings for his church, and his also unto his father, make it his earnest and only prayer for us in this world, that we all might be one in him? Joh. 17.20, 21, 22, 23. And it is possible that he (whom the Father heard always, Joh. 11.42.) should not have this last most solemn prayer heard and granted? Or shall it be granted for all the saints elsewhere, and not for the saints in England, so that amongst them dis-union shall grow
<PB N="194" REF="012626_0193_0F8B8EC2B6459DA0"/>
even about church union and communion? If it be possible for a little faith (so much as a grain of mustard-seed) to re∣move a mountain, is it not possible for so much strength of faith as it is, to be found in all the godly in the kingdom, to remove those images of jealousy, and to cast those stumb∣ling blocks out of the way, which may hinder the free passage of brotherly love amongst brethren? It's true in∣deed, the national covenant doth justly engage both parties faithfully to endeavor the utter extirpation of the antichris∣tian hierarchy; and much more of all blasphemies, here∣sies and errors. Certainly, if congregational discipline be independent, from the inventions of men is it not much more independent from the delusions of satan? What fellowship hath Christ with beliel? Light with darkness? Truth with error? The faithful Jews needed not the help of the Samaritans, to re-edify the temple of God; yea, they rejected their help when it was offered, Ezra. 4.1, 2, 3. And if the congregational way be a way of truth (as we believe) and if the brethren that walk in it be zealous of the truth, and hate every false way (as by the rule of their holy discipline they are instructed, 2 Joh. 10.11.) then verily there is no branch in the national covenant, that engageth the covenanters to abhor either the congre∣gational churches or their way; which being duly ad∣ministred, do no less effectually extirpate the anti-christian hierarchy, and all blasphemies, heresies, and pernicious errors, than the other way of discipline doth, which is more generally and publickly received and ratified.</P>
<P>But the Lord Jesus commune with all our hearts in secret, and he who is the king of his church, let him be pleased to exercise his kingly power in out spirits, that so his kingdom may come into our churches in purity and peace, AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the form of church government; and that it is one, immutable, and prescribed in the word.</HEAD>
<P>ECclesiastical polity, or church gevernment or disci∣pline, is nothing else but that form and order that is to be observed in the church of Christ upon earth, both for the constitution of it, and all the administrations that therein are to be performed. Ezek. 43.11. Col. 2.5. 1 Tim. 3.15.</P>
<P N="2">2. Church government is considered in a double respect, either in regard of the parts of government themselves, or necessary circumstances thereof. The parts of govern∣ment are prescribed in the word, because the Lord Jesus Christ, the King and lawgiver of his church, is no less faithful in the house of God than was Moses, who from the Lord delivered a form and pattern of government to the children of Israel in the old Testament; and the holy scriptures are now also so perfect, as that they are able to make the man of God perfect, and throughly furnished unto every good work; and therefore doubtless to the well ordering of the house of God. Heb. 3.5, 6. Exod. 25.40. 2 Tim. 3.16.</P>
<P N="3">3. The parts of church-government, are all of them ex∣actly described in the word of God, being parts or means of instituted worship, according to the second command∣ment and therefore to continue one and the same unto the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, as a kingdom that cannot be shaken, until he shall deliver it up unto God, even to the father. So that it is not left in the power of men, officers, churches, or any state in the world to add or diminish, or alter any thing in the least measure therein. 1 Tim. 3.15. 1 Chron. 15.13. Exod 20.4. 1 Tim. 6.13, 16. Heb. 12.27, 28. 1 Cor. 15.24. Deut. 12.32.</P>
<P N="4">4. The necessary circumstances, as time and place, &amp;c. belonging unto order and decency, are not so left unto men, as that under pretence of them they may thrust their own inventions upon the churches, being circumscribed in the word with many general limitations, where they are de∣termined in respect of the matter, to be neither worship
<PB N="196" REF="012626_0195_0F8B8EC41FEBE7D0"/>
it self, nor circumstances separable from worship. In re∣spect of their end, they must be done unto edification. In respect of the manner, decently and in order, according to the nature of the things themselves, and civil and church custom. Doth not even nature itself teach you? Yea, they are in some sort determined particularly, namely, that they be done in such a manner, as all circumstances considered, is most expedient for edification: So, as if there be no er∣ror of man concerning their determination, the determin∣ing of them is to be accounted as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> were divine. Ezek. 43.8. 1 Kings 12.31, 32, 33. 2 Kings 12. Exod. 20.19. Isa. 28.13. Col. 1.22, 23. Acts 15.28. Mat. 15.9. 1 Cor. 11.28. and 8.34. 1 Cor. 14.26. and 14.40. and 11.14.16. and 14.12.19. Acts 15.28.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the nature of the catholic church in general, and in special of a particular visible church.</HEAD>
<P>THE catholic church is the whole company of those that are elected, redeemed, and in time effectually called from the state of sin and death, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto a state of grace and salvation in Jesus Christ, Eph. 1.22, 23. and 5.25, 26, 30.</P>
<P N="2">2. This church is either triumphant or militant. Tri∣umphant, the number of them who are glorified in hea∣ven: Militant, the number of them who are conflicting with their enemies upon earth. Heb. 12, 23. Rom. 8.17. 2 Tim. 2.12. and 4.8. Eph. 6.12, 13.</P>
<P N="3">3. This militant church is to be considered as invisible, and visible. Invisible, in respect of their relation wherein they stand to Christ, as a body unto the head, being united unto him by the spirit of God, and faith in their hearts. Visible, in respect of the profession of their faith, in their persons and in particular churches. And so there may be acknowledged an universal visible church. 2 Tim. 2.19. Rev. 2.17. 1 Cor. 6.17. Eph. 3.17. Rom. 1.8. 1 Thess. 1.8. Isa. 2.2. 1 Tim. 6.12.</P>
<P N="4">4. The members of the visible militant church consider∣ed either as not yet in church order, or walking accord∣ing
<PB N="197" REF="012626_0196_0F8B8EC4DD7E7210"/>
to the church order of the gospel. In order, and so besides the spiritual union and communion common to believers, they enjoy moreover an union and communion ecclesiastical-political. So we deny an universal visible church. Acts 19.1. Col. 2.5. Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.12.</P>
<P N="5">5. The state of the members of the militant visible church walking in order, was either before the law, oeco∣nomical, that is in families; or under the law national; or since the coming of Christ, only congregational. (The term independent we approve not.) Therefore neither na∣tional, provincial nor classical. Gen. 18.19, Exod. 19.6.</P>
<P N="6">6. A congregational church is by the institution of Christ a part of the militant visible church, consisting of a company of saints by calling, united into one body by an holy covenant, for the public worship of God, and the mutual edification one of another, in the fellowship of the Lord Jesus. 1 Cor. 14.23, 36. and 1.2. and 12.27. Exod. 19.5.6. Deut. 29.1. and 9 to 15. Acts 2.42. 1 Cor. 14.26.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of the matter of the visible church, both is respect of quali∣ty and quantity.</HEAD>
<P>THE matter of a visible church are saints by calling. 1 Cor. 1.2. Eph. 1.1.</P>
<P N="2">2. By saints, we understand, 1. Such as have not only attained the knowledge of the principles of religion, and are free from gross and open scandals, but also do together with the profession of their faith and repentance, walk in blameless obedience to the word, so as that in chari∣table discretion they may be accounted saints by calling, (though perhaps some or more of them be unsound and hy∣pocrites inwardly) because the members of such particular churches are commonly by the Holy Ghost called saints &amp; faithful brethren in Christ; and sundry churches have been reproved for receiving and suffering such persons to con∣tinue in fellowship amongst them, as have been offensive and scandalous; the name of God also by this means is
<PB N="198" REF="012626_0197_0F8B8EC911CC1B48"/>
blasphemed, and the holy things of God defiled and pro∣faned, the hearts of the godly grieved, and the wicked themselves hardened, and holpen forward to damnation. The example of such doth endanger the sanctity of others: A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. 2. The chil∣dren of such, who are also holy. Heb. 6.1. 1 Cor. 1.5. Rom. 6.17. 1 Cor. 1.2. Phil. 1.2. Col. 1.2. Eph. 1.1. 1 Cor. 5.12, 13. Rev. 2.14.15, 20. Ezek. 44.7, 9, and 23.38, 39. Num. 19.20. Hag. 2.13, 14. 1 Cor. 11.27.29. Psal. 37.21. 1 Cor. 5.6. 2 Cor. 7.14.</P>
<P N="3">3. The members of churches, though orderly consti∣tuted, may in time degenerate, and grow corrupt and scandalous, which though they ought not to be tolerated in the church, yet their continuance therein, through the defect of the execution of discipline and just censures, doth not immediately dissolve the being of a church, as appears in the church of Israel, and the churches of Galatia and Corinth, Pergamus and Thyatira. Jer. 2.21. 1 Cor. 5.12. Jer. 2.4. Gal. 5.4. 2 Cor. 12.21. Rev. 2.14, 15. and 21.21.</P>
<P N="4">4. The matter of the church in respect of its quantity, ought not to be of greater number than may ordinarily meet together conveniently in one place; nor ordinarily fewer, than may conveniently carry on church-work. Hence when the holy scripture makes mention of the saints combined into a church estate, in a town or city where was but one congregation, it usually calleth those saints (the church) in the singular number; as, the church of the Thessalonians; the church of Smyrna, Philadelphia, and the like: But when it speaketh of the saints in a nation or province, wherein there were sundry congregations, it frequently and usually calleth them by the name of chur∣ches, in the plural number, as the churches of Asia, Gala∣tia, Macedonia, and the like; which is further confirm∣ed by what is written of sundry of those churches in par∣ticular, how they were assembled and met together, the whole church in one place, as the church at Jerusalem, the church at Antioch, the church at Corinth, and Cenchrea, though it were more near to Corinth, it being the port thereof, and answerable to a village, yet being a distinct congregation from Corinth, it had a church of its own, as well as Corinth had. 1 Cor. 14.21. Mat. 18.17. Rom.
<PB N="199" REF="012626_0198_0F8B8EC94551E0A0"/>
16.1. 1 Thess. 1.1. Rev. 2.8. and 3.7. 1 Cor. 16.1, 19. Gal. 1.2. 2 Cor. 8.1. 1 Thess. 2.14. Acts 2.46. and 5.12. and 6.2. and 14.27. and 15.38 1 Cor. 5.4. and 14.23. Rom. 16.1.</P>
<P N="5">5. Nor can it with reason be thought but that every church appointed and ordained by Christ, had a ministry ordained and appointed for the same; and yet plain it is, that there were no ordinary officers appointed by Christ for any other than congregational churches; elders being appointed to feed, not all flocks, but the particular flock of God, over which the Holy Ghost had made them over∣seers, and that flock they must attend, even the whole flock; and one congregation being as much as any ordinary elder can attend, therefore there is no greater church than a congregation, which may ordinarily meet in one place. Acts 20.28.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the form of a visible church, and of church-covenant.</HEAD>
<P>SAINTS by calling must have a visible political union among themselves, or else they are not yet a particu∣lar church, as those similitudes hold forth, which the scripture makes use of to shew the nature of particular churches, as a body, a building, house, hands, eyes, feet, and other members must be united, or else (remaining se∣parate) are not a body. Stones, timber, though squared, hewn and polished, are not a house, until they are com∣pacted and united; so saints or believers in judgment of charity, are not a church, unless orderly knit together. 1 Cor. 12.27. 1 Tim. 3.15. Eph. 2.22. 1 Cor. 12.15, 16, 17. Rev. 1.</P>
<P N="2">2. Particular churches cannot be distinguished one from another, but by their forms: <HI>Ephesus</HI> is not <HI>Smyrna,</HI> nor <HI>Pergamus Thyatira,</HI> but each one a distinct society of itself, having officers of their own, which had not the charge of others; virtues of their own, for which others are not praised; corruptions of their own, for which others are not blamed.</P>
<P N="3">3. This form is a visible covenant, agreement or con∣sent, whereby they give up themselves unto the Lord, to the observing of the ordinances of Christ together in the
<PB N="200" REF="012626_0199_0F8B93254F33EC08"/>
same society, which is usually called the church covenant: For we see not otherwise how members can have church power one over another mutually. The comparing of each particular church to a city, and unto a spouse, seem∣eth to conclude not only a form, but that form is by way of covenant. The covenant, as it was that which made the family of Abraham, and children of Israel to be a church and people unto God, so it is that which now makes the several societies of Gentile believers to be churches in these days. Exod. 19.5, 8. Deut. 29.12, 13. Zech. 11.14. and 9.11. Eph. 2.19. 2 Cor. 11.2. Gen. 17.7. Deut. 29.12, 13. Eph. 2.12, 18.</P>
<P N="4">4. This voluntary agreement, consent or covenant, (for all these are taken here for the same) altho' the more ex∣press and plain it is, the more fully it puts us in mind of our mutual duty, and stirreth us up to it, and leaveth less room for the questioning of the truth of the church estate of a company of professors, and the truth of member-ship of particular persons; yet we conceive the substance of it is kept, where there is a real agreement and consent of a company of faithful persons to meet constantly together in one congregation, for the public worship of God, and their mutual edification; which real agreement and consent they do express by their constant practice in coming to∣gether for the publick worship of God, and by their reli∣gious subjection to the ordinances of God there; the ra∣ther if we consider how scripture-covenants have been en∣tred into, not only expressly by word of mouth, but by sacrifice, by hand-writing and seal, and also sometimes by silent consent, without any writing or expression of words at all. Exod. 19.5. and 20.8 and 24.3.17. Josh. 24.18 to 24. Psal. 50.5. Neh. 9.3, 8 and 10. 1. Gen. 17. Deut. 29.</P>
<P N="5">5. This form being by mutual covenant, it followeth, it is not saith in the heart, nor the profession of that faith, nor co-habitation, nor baptism. 1. Not saith in the heart, because that is invisible. 2. Not a bare profession, be∣cause that declareth them no more to be members of one church than another. 3. Not co-habitation; atheists or infidels may dwell together with believers. 4. Not bap∣tism, because it pre-supposeth a church estate, as circum∣cision in the old testament, which gave no being to the church, the church being before it, and in the wilderness
<PB N="201" REF="012626_0200_0F8B932602E77FF0"/>
without it. Seals pre-suppose a covenant already in be∣ing. One person is a compleat subject of baptism, but one person is uncapable of being a church.</P>
<P N="6">6. All believers ought, as God giveth them opportuni∣ty thereunto, to endeavour to join themselves unto a par∣ticular church, and that in respect of the honor of Jesus Christ, in his example and institution, by the professed acknowledgement of, and subjection unto the order and ordinances of the gospel; as also in respect of their good of communion, founded upon their visible union, and con∣tained in the promises of Christ's special presence in the church; whence they have fellowship with him, and in him one with another; also, for the keeping of them in the way of God's commandments, and recovering of them in case of wandering (which all Christ's sheep are subject to in this life) being unable to return of themselves; to∣gether with the benefit of their mutual edification, and of their posterity, that they may not be cut off from the privileges of the covenant. Otherwise if a believer offends, he remains distitute of the remedy provided in that behalf. And should all believers neglect this duty of joining to all particular congregations, it might follow thereupon, that Christ should have no visible political churches upon earth. Acts 2.24. and 9.26. Mat. 3.13, 14, 15. and 28, 29, 30. Psal. 123.2.3. and 87.7. Mat. 18.20. 1 John 1.3. Psal. 119.176. 1 Pet. 2.25. Eph. 4.16. Joh. 22.24, 25. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of the first subject of church power, or, to whom church power doth first belong.</HEAD>
<P>THE first subject of church power, is eitheir su∣preme or subordinate and ministerial: The supreme (by way of gift from the father) is the Lord Jesus Christ: The ministerial is either extraordinary as the apostles, prophets and evangelists; or ordinary, as every particular congregational church. Mat. 18.18. Rev. 3.7. Isa. 9.6. John 20.21.23. 1 Cor. 14.32. Tit. 1.5. 1 Cor. 5.12.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ordinary church-power, is either the power of office, that is, such as is proper to the eldership, or power of pri∣vilege,
<PB N="202" REF="012626_0201_0F8B932A08FEC3D0"/>
such as belongs to the brotherhood. The latter is in the brethren formally, and immediately from Christ, that is, so as it may be acted or exercised immediately by themselves; the former is not in them formally or imme∣diately, and therefore cannot be acted or exercised im∣mediately by them, but is said to be in them, in that they design the persons unto office, who only are to act, or to exercise this power. Rom. 12.4.8. Acts 1.2, 3, and 6, 3, 4, and 14.23. 1 Cor. 10.29, 30.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="6" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VI. Of the officers of the church, and especially of pastors and teachers.</HEAD>
<P>A Church being a company of people combined toge∣ther by covenant, for the worship of God, it ap∣peareth thereby, there may be the essence and be∣ing of a church without any officers, seeing there is both the form and matter of a church; which is implied when it is said, The apostles ordained elders in every church, Acts 14.23.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nevertheless, though officers be not absolutely neces∣sary to the simple being of churches, when they be called, yet ordinarily to their calling, they are, and to their well∣being; and therefore the Lord Jesus, out of his tender com∣passion, hath appointed and ordained officers, which he would not have done, if they had not been useful and needful for the church; yea, being ascended into heaven, he received gifts for men, and gave gifts to men, where∣of officers for the church are justly accounted no small parts, they being to continue to the end of the world, and for the perfecting of all the saints. Rom. 10.17. Jer. 3.15. 1 Cor. 12.28. Eph. 4.11. Psal. 68.18. Eph. 4.8, 11, and 4.12, 13.</P>
<P N="3">3. These officers were either extraordinary or ordinary: Extraordinary, as apostles, prophets, evangelists; ordinary, as elders and deacons. The apostles, prophets and evan∣gelists as they were called extraordinarily by Christ, so their office ended with themselves. Whence it is that Paul directing Timothy how to carry along church ad∣ministrations, giveth no direction about the choice or course of apostles, prophets or evanglists, but only of elders <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; and when Paul was to take his last leave
<PB N="203" REF="012626_0202_0F8B932C7AF92B00"/>
of the church of Ephesus, he committed the care of feed∣ing the church to no other but unto the elders of that church. The like charge doth Peter commit to the elders. 1. Cor. 12.28. Eph. 4.11. Acts 8.6, 16, 19. and 11.28. Rom. 11.13. 1 Cor. 4.9. 1 Tim. 3.1, 2, 8 to 13. Tit. 1.8. Acts 20.17, 28. 1 Pet. 5.1, 2, 3.</P>
<P N="4">4. Of elders (who are also in scripture called bishops) some attend chiefly to the ministry of the word, as the pastors and teachers; others attend especially unto rule, who are therefore called ruling elders. 1 Tim. 2.3. Phil. 1.1. Acts 20.17, 28. 1 Tim. 5.17.</P>
<P N="5">5. The office of pastor and teacher, appears to be dis∣tinct. The pastors special work is, to attend to exhorta∣tion, and therein to administer a word of wisdom: The tercher is to attend to doctrine, and therein to administer a word of knowledge: And either of them to administer the seals of that covenant, unto the dispensation whereof they are alike called; as also to execute the censures, be∣ing but a kind of application of the word: The preaching of which, together with the application thereof, they are alike charged withal. Eph. 4.11. Rom. 12.7.8. 1 Cor. 12.8. 2 Tim. 4.1, 2. Tit. 1.9.</P>
<P N="6">6. And forasmuch as both pastors and teachers are given by Christ for the perfecting of the saints, and edifying of his body; which saints and body of Christ is his church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> And therefore we account pastors and teachers to be both of them church officers, and not the pastor for the church, and the teacher only for the schools; Tho' this we gladly acknowledge, that schools are both lawful, profitable and necessary for the training up of such in good literature or learning, as may afterwards be called forth unto office of pastor or teacher in the church. Eph. 4.11, 12. and 1.22, 23. 1 Sam. 10.12, 19.20. 2 Kings 2.3, 15.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of ruling elders and deacons.</HEAD>
<P>THE ruling elders office is distinct from the office of pastor and teacher. The ruling elders are not so called, to exclude the pastors and teachers from ruling, because ruling and governing is common to these
<PB N="204" REF="012626_0203_0F8B932D2CBCAEB8"/>
with the other, whereas attending to teach and preach the word is peculiar unto the former. Rom. 12.7, 8, 9. 1 Tim. 5.17. 1 Cor. 12.28. Heb. 13.17. 1 Tim. 5.17.</P>
<P N="2">2. The ruling elders work is to join with the pastor and teacher in those acts of spiritual rule, which are distinct from the ministry of the word and sacraments committed to them. Of which sort these be as followeth: 1. To open and shut the doors of God's house by the admission of members approved by the church; by ordination of officers chosen by the church, and by excommunication of notorious and obstinate offenders renounced by the church, and by restoring of penitents forgiven by the church. 2. To call the church together when there is occasion, and seasonably to dismiss them again. 3. To prepare matters in private, that in public they may be carried to an end with less trouble, and more speedy dispatch. 4. To mo∣derate the carriage of all matters in the church assembled; as, to propound matters to the church, to order the season of speech and silence, and to pronounce sentence according to the mind of Christ, with the consent of the church.</P>

The office and work of a deacon, is to receive

the offerings of the church, gifts given to the church, and to keep the treasury of the church, and therewith to serve the tables, which the church is to provide for; as the Lord's table, the table of the ministers, and of such as are in necessity, to whom they are to distribute in simpli∣city. Acts 6.3. Phil. 1.1. 1 Tim. 3.8. 1 Cor. 12.28. 1 Tim. 3.8, 9. Acts 4.35. and 6.2, 3. Rom. 12.8.</P>

<P N="6">6. The instituting of all these officers in the church, is the work of God himself, of the Lord Jesus Christ, of the Holy Ghost; and therefore such officers as he hath not ap∣pointed, are altogether unlawful either to be placed in the church, or to be retained therein, and are to be looked at as human creatures, meer inventions and appointments of men, to the great dishonor of Christ Jesus the Lord of his house, the king of his church, whether popes, patriarchs, cardinals, arch-bishops, lord-bishops, arch-deacons, offici∣als, commissaries, and the like. These and the rest of that hierarchy and retinue, not being plants of the Lord's planting, shall be all certainly rooted out and cast forth. 1 Cor. 12.28. Eph. 4.8, 11. Acts 20.28. Mat. 15.13.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. Of the election of church officers.</HEAD>
<P>NO man may take the honor of a church officer unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron. Heb. 5.4.</P>
<P N="2">2. Calling unto office is either immediate, by Christ himself, such was the call of the apostles and prophets,
<PB N="206" REF="012626_0205_0F8B933514E8F378"/>
this manner of calling ended with them as hath been said: Or mediate, by the church. Gal. 1.1. Acts 14.23. and 6.3.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is meet that before any be ordained, or chosen officers, they should be first tried and proved, because hands are not suddenly to be laid upon any, and both elders and deacons must be of honest and good report. 1 Tim. 5.22. and 7.10. Acts 16.2. and 6.3.</P>
<P N="4">4. The things in respect of which they are to be tried, are those gifts and virtues which the scripture requireth in men that are to be elected into such places, viz. that the elders must be blameless, sober, apt to teach, and endued with such other qualifications as are laid down, 1 Tim. 3. 2. Tit. 1.6 to 9. Deacons to be fitted as is directed, Acts 6.3. 1 Tim. 3.8 to 11.</P>
<P N="5">5. Officers are to be called by such churches whereunto they are to minister. Of such moment is the preservation of this power, that the churches exercised it in the pre∣sence of the apostles. Acts 14.23. and 1.23. and 6.3, 4, 5.</P>
<P N="6">6. A church being free, cannot become subject to any, but by a free election; yet when such a people do chuse any to be over them in the Lord, then do they become subject, and most willingly submit to their ministry in the Lord, whom they have so chosen. Gal. 5.13. Heb. 13.17.</P>
<P N="7">7. And if the church have power to chuse their officers and ministers, then in case of manifest unworthiness and delinquency, they have power also to depose them: for, to open and shut, to chuse and refuse, to constitute in of∣fice, and remove from office, are acts belonging to the same power. Rom. 16.17.</P>
<P N="8">8. We judge it much conducing to the well-being and communion of churches, that where it may conveniently be done, neighbour churches be advised withal, and their help be made use of in the trial of church-officers, in order to their choice, Cant. 8.8, 9.</P>
<P N="9">9. The choice of such church-officers belongeth not to the civil magistrates, as such, or diocesan-bishops, or pa∣trons; for of these, or any such-like, the scripture is wholly silent, as having any power therein.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of ordination, and imposition of hands.</HEAD>
<P>CHURCH officers are not only to be chosen by the church, but also to be ordained by imposition of hands and prayer, with which at the ordination of elders, fasting also is to be joined. Acts 13.3. and 14.23. 1 Tim. 5.22.</P>
<P N="2">2. This ordination we account nothing else but the solemn putting a man into his place and office in the church, whereunto he had right before by election; being like the installing of a magistrate in the common wealth. Ordination therefore is not to go before but to follow e∣lection. The essence and substance of the outward calling of an ordinary officer in the church, doth not consist in his ordination, but in his voluntary and free election by the church, and his accepting of that election; whereupon is founded that relation between pastor and flock, between such a minister and such a people. Ordination doth not constitute an officer, nor give him the essentials of his of∣fice. The apostles were elders without imposition of hands by men; Paul and Barnabas were officers before that imposition of hands, Acts 13.3. The posterity of Levi were priests and levites, before hands were laid on them by the children of Israel. Numb. 8.10. Acts 6.5, 6. and 13.2.3. and 14.23. 1 Tim. 4.14. 1 Tim. 5.22.</P>
<P N="3">3. In such churches where there are elders, impo∣sition of hands in ordination, is to be performed by those elders.</P>
<P N="4">4. In such churches where there are no elders, impo∣sition of hands may be performed by some of the brethren orderly chosen by the church thereunto. For if the peo∣ple may elect officers, which is the greater, and wherein the substance of the office doth consist, they may much more (occasion and need so requiring) impose hands in ordination, which is less, and but the accomplishment of the other. Numb. 8.10.</P>
<P N="5">5. Nevertheless, in such churches where there are no elders, and the church so desire, we see not why impositi∣on of hands may not be performed by the elders of other churches. Ordinary officers laid hands upon the officers
<PB N="208" REF="012626_0207_0F8B93368917D1E0"/>
of many churches: The presbytery at Ephesus laid hands upon Timothy, an evangelist; the presbytery at Antioch laid hands upon Paul and Barnabas. 1 Tim. 4.14. Acts 13.3.</P>
<P N="6">6. Church officers are officers to one church, even that particular church over which the Holy Ghost hath made them overseers. Insomuch as elders are commanded to feed, not all flocks, but that flock which is committed to their faith and trust, and dependeth upon them. Nor can constant residence at one congregation be necessary for a minister, no, nor yet lawful, if he be not a minister to one congregation only, but to the church universal; be∣cause he may not attend one part only of the church to which he is a minister, but he is called to attend unto all the flock. 1 Pet. 5.2. Acts 20.28.</P>
<P N="7">7. He that is clearly loosed from his office relation unto the church whereof he was a minister, cannot be looked at as an officer, nor perform any act of office in any other church, unless he be again orderly called unto office; which when it shall be, we know nothing to hin∣der, but imposition of hands also in his ordination ought to be used towards him again. For so Paul the apostle re∣ceived imposition of hands twice at least from Annanias. Acts 9.17. and 13.3.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="10" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the power of the church, and its presbytery.</HEAD>
<P>SUPREAM and lordly power over all the churches upon earth doth only belong unto Jesus Christ, who is king of the church, and the head thereof. He hath the government upon his shoulders, and hath all power given to him both in heaven and earth. Psal. 2.6. Eph. 1.21, 22. Isa. 9.6. Matt. 28.18.</P>
<P N="2">2. A company of professed believers ecclesiastically confederate, as they are a church, before they have officees, and without them; so even in that estate, subordinate church power, under Christ, delegated to them by him, doth belong to them in such a manner as is before expres∣sed, chap. 5. sect. 2. and as flowing from the very nature and essence of a church: It being natural to all bodies, and so unto a church body, to be furnished with sufficient power for its own preservation and subsistence. Acts 1.23. and 14.23. and 6.3, 4. Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.4.5.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="209" REF="012626_0208_0F8B93375AA46B58"/>3. This government of the church is a mixt govern∣ment, (and so hath been acknowledged long before the term of independency was heard of) in respect of Christ, the head and king of the church, and the sovereign power residing in him, and exercised by him, it is a monarchy; in respect of the body or brotherhood of the church, and power from Christ granted unto them, it resembles a de∣mocracy; in respect of the presbytery, and power com∣mitted unto them, it is an aristocracy. Rev. 3.7. 1 Cor. 5.12. 1 Tim. 5.27.</P>
<P N="4">4. The sovereign power which is peculiar unto Christ, is exercised. 1. In calling the church out of the world un∣to holy fellowship with himself. 2. In instituting the ordi∣nances of his worship, and appointing his ministers and of∣ficers for the dispensing of them. 3. In giving laws for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ordering of all our ways, and the ways of his house. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ▪ In giving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and life to all his institutions, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 5. In protecting and delivering his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and from all the enemies of their peace. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Rev. 5.8, 9. Mat. 28.20. Eph. 4.8, 11. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 4.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Isa. 33.22. 1 Tim. 3.15. 2 Cor. 10. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 5. Isa. 32.2. Luke 17.1.</P>
<P N="5">5. The power granted by Christ unto the body of the church and brotherhood, is a prerogative or privilege which the church doth exercise. 1. In chusing their own offi∣cers, whether elders or deacons. 2. In admission of their own members, and therefore there is great reason they should have power to remove any from their fellowship a∣gain. Hence in case of offence, any brother hath power to convince and admonish an offending brother; and in case of not hearing him, to take one or two more to set on the admonition; and in case of not hearing them, to proceed to tell the church; and as his offence may require, the whole church hath power to proceed to the censure of him, whether by ad∣monition or excommunication; and upon his repentance, to restore him again unto his former communion. Acts 3.5. and 14.23. and 9.26. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. Tit. 3.10. Col. 4.17. 2 Cor. 2.7, 8.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="210" REF="012626_0209_0F8B93381158E718"/>6. In case an elder offend incorrigibly, the matter so requiring, as the church had power to call him to office, so they have power according to order (the council of other churches, where it may be had, directing thereto) to re∣move him from his office; and being now but a member, in case he add contumacy to his sin, the church that had power to receive him into their fellowship, hath the same power to cast him out, that they have concerning any other member. Col. 4.17. Rom. 16.17. Mat. 18.17.</P>
<P N="7">7. Church government or rule, is placed by Christ in the officers of the church, who are therefore called rulers▪ while they rule with God; yet in case of male administra∣tion, they are subject to the power of the church, as hath been said before. The Holy Ghost frequently, yea al∣ways, where it mentioneth church rule, and church govern∣ment, ascribeth it to elders; whereas the work and duty of the people is expressed in the phrase of obeying their elders, and submitting themselves unto them in the Lord. So as it is manifest, that an organic or com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oat church is a body politic, consisting of some that are governors, and some that are governed in the Lord. 1 Tim. 5.17. Heb. 13.17. 1 Thess. 5.12. Rom. 12.8. 1 Tim. 5. 17. 1 Cor. 12.28, 29. Heb. 13.7, 17.</P>
<P N="8">8. The power which Christ has committed to the el∣ders, is to feed and rule the church of God, and according∣ly to call the church together upon any weighty occasion; when the members, so called, without a just cause, may not refuse to come, nor when they are come, depart be∣fore they are dismiss'd, nor speak in the church before they have leave from the elders; nor continue so doing when they require silence; nor may they oppose nor contradict the judgment or sentence of the elders, without sufficient and weighty cause, because such practices are manifestly contrary unto order and government, and in-lets of distur∣bances, and tend to confusion. Acts 20.28. and 6.2. Num. 16.12. Ezek. 46.10. Acts 13.15. Hos. 4.4.</P>
<P N="9">9. It belongs also unto the elders to examine any offi∣cers or members before they be received of the church; to receive the accusations brought to the church, and to prepare them for the churches hearing. In handling of offences, and other matters before the church, they have
<PB N="211" REF="012626_0210_0F8B9338D2663868"/>
power to declare and publish the counsel and will of God, touching the same, and to pronounce sentence with con∣sent of the church. Lastly, They have power, when they dismiss the people, to bless them in the name of the Lord. Rev. 2.2. 1 Tim. 5.19. Acts 21.18, 22, 23. 1 Cor. 5.4, 5. Numb. 6. 23 to 26.</P>
<P N="10">10. This power of government in the elders doth not any wise prejudice the power of privilege in the brother∣hood; as neither the power of privilege in the brethren doth prejudice the power of government in the elders, but they may sweetly agree together; as we may see in the ex∣ample of the apostles, furnished with the greatest church power, who took in the concurrence and consent of the brethren in church administrations. Also that scripture, 2 Cor. 2.9. and 10.6. do declare, That what the churches are to act and do in these matters they were to do in a way of obedience, and that not only to the directi∣on of the apostles, but also of their ordinary elders. Acts 14.15, 23, and 6.2. 1 Cor. 5.4. 2 Cor. 26.7. Heb. 13.17.</P>
<P N="11">11. From the premises, namely, That the ordinary power of government belonging only to the elders, power of privilege remaineth with the brotherhood (as the power of judgment in matters of censure, and power of liberty in matters of liberty) it followeth, that in an organic church and right administration, all church acts proceed after the manner of a mixt administration, so as no church act can be consummated or perfected without the consent of both.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the maintenance of church officers.</HEAD>
<P>THE apostle concludes, that necessary and suffici∣ent maintenance is due unto the ministers of the word, from the law of nature and nations, from the law of Moses, the equity thereof, as also the rule of common reason. Moreover, the scripture doth not only
<PB N="212" REF="012626_0211_0F8B933988720490"/>
call elders, labourors and workmen, but also speaking of them doth say, that the labourer is worthy of his hire; and requires, that he which is taught in the word should communicate to him in all good things; and mentions it as an ordinance of the Lord, that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel; and forbiddeth the muz∣ling the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn, 1 Cor. 9.14, 15. Mat. 9.38. and 10.10. 1 Tim. 5.18. Gal. 6.6. 1 Cor. 9.9, 14.</P>
<P N="2">2. The scriptures alledged, requiring this maintenance as a bounden duty, and due debt, and not as a matter of alms and free gift, therefore people are not at liberty to do or not to do, what and when they please in this mat∣ter, no more than in any other commanded duty, and or∣dinance of the Lord; but ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>duty to minister of their carnal things, to them that labour among them in the word and doctrine, as well as as they ought to pay any other workmen their wages, and to discharge and satisfy their other debts, or to submit themselves to observe any other ordinance of the Lord, Rom. 15.27. 1 Cor. 9.21.</P>
<P N="3">3. The apostle (Gal. 6.6.) enjoining, that he which is taught communicateth to them that teacheth in all good things, doth not leave it arbitrary, what or how much a man shall give, or in what proportion, but even the latter as well as the former, is prescribed and appointed by the Lord, 1 Cor. 16.2.</P>
<P N="4">4. Not only members of churches, but all that are taught in the word, are to contribute unto him that teach∣eth in all good things. In case that congregations are defective in their contributions, the deacons are to call upon them to do their duty: if their call sufficeth not, the church by her power is to require it of their members; and where church power, through the corruption of men, doth not or cannot attain the end, the magistrate is to see that the ministry be duly provided for, as appears from the commended example of Nehemiah. The magistrates are nursing fathers, and nursing mothers, and stand charg∣ed with the custody of both tables; because it is better to prevent a scandal that it may not come, and easier also, than to remove it when it is given. Its most suitable to
<PB N="213" REF="012626_0212_0F8B933A4C0AA440"/>
rule, that by the churches care each man should know his proportion according to rule, what he should do, before he do it, that so his judgment and heart may be satisfied in what he doth, and just offence prevented in what is done, Acts 6.3, 4. Neh. 13.11. Isa. 49.23. 2 Cor. 8.13.14.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XII. Of the admission of members into the church.</HEAD>
<P>THE doors of the churches of Christ upon earth do not by God's appointment stand so wide open, that all sorts of people, good or bad, may freely enter therein at their pleasure, but such as are admitted thereto, as members, ought to be examined and tried first, whether they be fit and meet to be received, into church-society or not. The eunuch of Ethiopia, before his ad∣mission was examined by Philip, whether he did believe on Jesus Christ with all his heart. The angel of the church at Ephesus is commended for trying such as said they were apostles, and were not. There is like reason for trying of them that profess to be believers. The of∣ficers are charged with the keeping of the doors of the church, and therefore are in a special manner to make tryal of the fitness of such who enter. Twelve angels are set at the gates of the temple, lest such as where cere∣monially unclean should enter thereinto. 2 Chron. 23.19. Mat. 13.25. and 22.12. Acts 8.37. Rev. 2.2. Acts 9.26. Rev. 21.12. 2 Chro. 23.19.</P>
<P N="2">2. The things which are requisite to be found in all church members, are repentance from sin, and faith in Jesus Christ; and these are the things whereof men are to be examined at their admission into the church, and which then they must profess and hold forth in such sort, as may satisfy rational charity that the things are there indeed. John Baptist admitted men to baptism confessing and be∣wailing their sins; and of others it is said, That they came and confessed and shewed their deeds. Acts 2.38 to 42. and 8.37. Mat. 3.6. Acts 1.9, 18.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="214" REF="012626_0213_0F8B933AFA780098"/>3. The weakest measure of faith is to be accepted in those that desire to be admitted into the church, because weak christians, if sincere, have the substance of that faith, repentance and holiness which is required in church mem∣bers; and such have most need of the ordinances for their confirmation and growth in grace. The Lord Jesus would not quench the smoaking flax, not break the bruised reed, but gather the tender lambs in his arms, and carry them gently in his bosom. Such charity and tenderness is to be used, as the weakest christian, if sincere, may not be ex∣cluded nor discouraged. Severity of examination is to be avoided. Rom. 14.1. Mat. 12.20. Isa. 40.11.</P>
<P N="4">4. In case any through excessive fear, or other infirmi∣ty, be unable to make their personal relation of their spiri∣tual estate in public, it is sufficient that the elders having received private satisfaction, make relation thereof in pub∣lic before the church, they testifying their assents thereun∣to; this being the way that tendeth most to edification. But where persons are of great abilities, there it is most expedient that they make their relations and confessions personally with their own mouth, as David professeth of himself, Psal. 66.16.</P>
<P N="5">5. A personal and public confession, and declaring of God's manner of working upon the soul, is both lawful, expedient and useful, in sundry respects, and upon sundry grounds. Those three thousand, Acts 2.37, 41. before they were admitted by the apostles, did manifest that they were pricked in the heart at Peter's sermon, together with earnest desire to be delivered from their sins, which now wounded their conscience, and their ready receiving of the word of promise and exhortation. We are to be ready to render a reason of the hope that is in us, to every one that asketh us; therefore we must be able and ready upon any occasion to declare and shew our repentence for sin, faith unfeigned, and effectual calling, because these are the reasons of a well grounded hope. I have not hidden my righteousness from the great congregation, Psal. 40.10. 1 Pet. 3.15. Heb. 11.1. Eph. 1.18.</P>
<P N="6">6. This profession of faith and repent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, as it must be made by such at their admission, that were never in church society before; so nothing hindereth, but the same
<PB N="215" REF="012626_0214_0F8B933D385E9A60"/>
way also be performed by such as have formerly been members of some other church, and the church to which they now join themselves as members may lawfully re∣quire the same. Those three thousand, Acts 2, which made their confession, were members of the church of the Jews before, so were they that were baptised by John. Churches may err in their admission and persons regularly admitted, may fall into offence. Otherwise if churches might ob∣trude their members, or if church members, might obtrude themselves upon other churches without due trial, the mat∣ter so requiring, both the liberty of churches would hereby be infringed, in that they might not examine those, con∣cerning whose fitness for communion they were unsatisfied; and besides, the infringing of their liberty, the churches themselves would unavoidably be corrupted, and the ordi∣nances defiled, whilst they might not refuse, but must re∣ceive the unworthy; which is contrary unto the scripture, teaching that all churches are sisters, and therefore equal. Mat. 3.1, 6. Gal. 2.4. 1 Tim. 5.24. Cant. 8.8.</P>
<P N="7">7. The like trial is to be required from such members of the church as were born in the same, or received their membership and were baptised in their infancy, or minor∣ity, by virtue of the covenant of their parents, when be∣ing grown up unto years of discretion, they shall desire to be made partakers of the Lord's supper; unto which, because holy things must not be given to the unworthy, therefore it is requisite, that these as well as others, should come to their trial and examination, and manifest their faith and repentance by an open profession thereof, before they are received to the Lord's supper, and otherwise not to be admitted thereunto. Yet these church members that were so born, or received in their child-hood, before they are capable of being made partakers of full communion, have many privileges which others (no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> church members) have not; they are in covenant with God, have the seal thereof upon them, viz. baptism; and so if not regene∣rated, yet are in a more hopeful way of attaining regene∣rating grace, and all the spiritual blessings both of the covenant and seal: they are also under church-watch, and consequently subject to the reprehensions, admonitions, and censures thereof, for their healing and amendment, as need shall require, Mat. 7.6. 1 Cor. 11.27.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of church members their removal from one church to another, and of recommendation and dismission.</HEAD>
<P>CHURCH members may not remove or depart from the church, and so one from another as they please, nor without just and weighty cause, but ought to live and dwell together, forasmuch as they are command∣ed not to forsake the assembling themselves together. Such departure tends to the dissolution and ruin of the body, as the pulling of stones and pieces of timber from the build∣ing, and of members from the natural body tends to the destruction of the whole. Heb. 10.25.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is therefore the duty of church-members in such times and places where council may be had, to consult with the church whereof they are members about their removal, that accordingly they having their approbation, may be encouraged or otherwise desist. They who are joined with consent, should not depart without consent, except forced thereunto. Pro. 11.16.</P>
<P N="3">3. If a member's departure be manifestly unsafe and sinful, the church may not consent thereunto; for in so doing, they should not act in faith, and should partake with him in his sin. If the case be doubtful, and the per∣son not to be perswaded, it seemeth best to leave the mat∣ter unto God, and not forcibly to detain him. Rom. 14.23. 1 Tim. 5.22. Acts 21.14.</P>
<P N="4">4. Just reasons for a member's removal of himself from the church, are, 1. If a man cannot continue without partaking in sin. 2. In case of personal persecution; so Paul departed from the disciples at Damascus. Also in case of general persecution, when all are scattered. 5. In case of real, and not only pretended want of competent subsistence, a door being opened for better supply in ano∣ther place, together with the means of spiritual edification. In these or like cases, a member may lawfully remove, and the church, cannot lawfully detain him. Eph. 5.11. Acts 9.25, 29, 30. and 8.1. Neh. 13.20.</P>
<P N="5">5. To seperate from a church, either out of contempt of their holy fellowship, or out of covetousness, or for
<PB N="217" REF="012626_0216_0F8B933E26C93300"/>
greater enlargements, with just grief to the church; or out of schism, or want of love, and out of a spirit of con∣tention, in respect of some unkindness, or some evil only conceived, or indeed in the church, which might and should be tolerated and healed with a spirit of meekness, and of which evil the church is not yet convinced (tho' perhaps himself be) nor admonished; for these or the like reasons to withdraw from public communion in word, or seals, or censures, is unlawful and sinful. 2 Tim. 4.10. Rom. 16.17. Judge 5.19. Eph. 4.2, 3. Col. 3.13. Gal. 6.1, 2.</P>
<P N="6">6. Such members as have orderly removed their habi∣tation, ought to join themselves unto the church in order where they do inhabit, if it may be; otherwise, they can neither perform the duties, nor receive the privileges of members. Such an example tolerated in some, is apt to corrupt others, which if many should follow, would threa∣ten the dissolution and confusion of churches, contrary to the scripture. Isa. 56.8. Acts 9.26. 1 Cor. 14.33.</P>
<P N="7">7. Order requires that a member thus removing, have letters testimonial, and of dismission from the church where∣of he yet is, unto the church whereunto he desireth to be joined, lest the church should be deluded; that the church may receive him in the faith, and not be corrupted by re∣ceiving deceivers, and false brethren, until the person dis∣missed be received into another church, he ceaseth not by his letters or dismission to be a member of the church whereof he was, the church cannot make a member no member, but by excommunication. Acts 18.27.</P>
<P N="8">8. If a member be called to remove only for a time, where a church is, letters of recommendation are requisite, and sufficient for communion with that church, in the or∣dinances, and in their watch; as Phoebe, a servant of the church at Cenchrea, had letters written for her to the church at Rome, that she might be received as becometh saints. Rom. 16.1, 2. 2 Cor. 3, 1.</P>
<P N="9">9. Such letters of recommendation and dismission were written for Apollos, for Marcus to the Colossians; for Phoebe to the Romans, for sundry others to other churches.
<PB N="218" REF="012626_0217_0F8B933EC1767B30"/>
And the apostle telleth us, that some persons, not suffici∣ently known otherwise, have special need of such letters, though he for his part had no need thereof. The use of them is to be a benefit and help to the party for whom they are written, and for the furthering of his receiving amongst the saints in the place whereto he goeth, and the due satisfaction of them in their receiving of him. Acts 18.27. Col. 4.10. Rom. 16.1. 2 Cor. 3.1.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. Of excommunication, and other censures.</HEAD>
<P>THE censures of the church are appointed by Christ for the preventing, removing, and healing of of∣fences in the church; for the reclaiming and gain∣ing of offending brethren, for the deterring others from the like offences, for purging out the leaven which may infect the whole lump; for vindicating the honor of Christ, and of his church, and the holy profession of the gospel; and for preventing of the wrath of God, that may justly fall upon the church, if they should suffer his covenant, and the seals thereof to be profaned by notorious and obstinate offenders. 1 Tim. 5.20. Deut. 17.12, 13. Jude 5.19. Deut. 13.11. 1 Cor. 5.6. Rom. 2.24. Rev. 2.14, 15, 16, 20.</P>
<P N="2">2. If an offence be private, (one brother offending another) the offender is to go and acknowledge his repen∣tance for it unto his offended brother, who is then to for∣give him; but if the offender neglect or refuse to do it, the brother offended is to go and convince and admonish him of it, between themselves privately: If thereupon the offender be brought to repent of his offence, the admo∣nisher hath won his brother; but if the offender hear not his brother, the brother offended is to take with him one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established, (whether the word of ad∣monition, if the offender receive it; or the word of com∣plaint, if he refuse it;) for if he refuse it, the offended brother is by the mouth of the elders to tell the church, and if he hear the church, and declare the same by peni∣tent
<PB N="219" REF="012626_0218_0F8B933F84CBE7C0"/>
confession, he is recovered and gained; and if the church discern him to be willing to hear, yet not fully con∣vinced of his offence, as in case of heresie, they are to dis∣pense to him a public admonition; which declaring the offender to lie under the public offence of the church, doth thereby withold or suspend him from the holy fellowship of the Lord's supper, till his offence be removed by peni∣tent confession. If he still continue oststinate, they are to cast him out by excommunication. Mat. 5.23, 24. Luke 17.3, 4. Mat. 18.15, 26, 17. Tit. 3.10.</P>
<P N="3">3. But if the offence be more public at first, and of a more heinous and criminal nature, to wit, such as are con∣demned by the light of nature, then the church, without such gradual proceedings, is to cast out the offender from their holy communion, for the further mortifying of his sins, and the healing of his soul in the day of the Lord Jesus. 1 Cor. 5.4, 5, 11.</P>
<P N="4">4. In dealing with an offender, great care is to be ta∣ken, that we be neither over strict or rigorous, nor too in∣dulgent or remiss; our proceeding herein, ought to be with a spirit of meckness, considering ourselves, least we also be tempted; and that the best of us have need of much forgiveness from the Lord. Yet the winning and healing of the offender's soul, being the end of these en∣deavors, we must not d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ub with untempered mortar, nor heal the wounds of our brethren sligh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly. On some have compassion, others save with fear. Gal. 6.1. Mat. 18.34, 35. Ezek. 13.10.</P>
<P N="5">5. While the off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder remains excommunicate, the church is to refrain all member-like communion with him in spiritual things, and also from all familiar communion with him in civil things, further than the necessity of na∣tural, domestical or civil relations do require; and are therefore to forbear to eat and drink with him, that he may be ashamed. Mat. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.11. 2 Thes. 3.6, 14.</P>
<P N="6">6. Excommunication being a spiritual punishment, it doth not prejudice the excommunicate in, nor deprive him of his civil rights, and therefore toucheth not princes, nor other magistrates in point of their civil dignity or autho∣rity, and the excommunicate being but as a publican, and a heathen, (heathens being lawfully permitted to come to
<PB N="220" REF="012626_0219_0F8B93404880B260"/>
hear the word in church assemblies) we acknowledge there∣fore the like liberty of hearing the word may be permitted to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sons excommunicate, that is permitted unto heathen, And because we are not without hope of his recovery, we are not to account him as an enemy, but to admonish him as a brother. 1 Cor. 14.24, 25. 2 Thess. 3.14.</P>
<P N="7">7. If the Lord sanctify the censure to the offender, so as by the grace of Christ he doth testify his repentance with humble confession of his sins, and judging of himself, giving glory unto God, the church is then to forgive him, and to comfort him, and to restore him to the wonted brotherly communion, which formerly he enjoyed with them, 2 Cor. 2.7, 8.</P>
<P N="8">8. The suffering of the prophane or scandalous livers to continue in fellowship, and partake in the sacraments, is doubtless a great sin in those that have power in their hands to redress it, and do it not: Nevertheless, inas∣much as Christ and his apostles in their times, and the prophets and the other godly in theirs, did lawfully par∣take of the Lord's commanded ordinances in the Jewish church, and neither taught nor practised separation from the same, though unworthy ones were permitted therein, and inasmuch as the faithful in the church of Corinth, wherein were many unwor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hy persons and practices, are never commanded to absent themselves from the sacraments, because of the same; therefore the godly in like cases are not presently to separate, Rev. 2.14, 15, 20. Mat. 23.3. Acts 3.1. 1 Cor. 6. and 15.12.</P>
<P N="9">9. As separation from such a church wherein prophane and scandalous persons are tolerated, is not presently ne∣cessary; so for the members thereof, otherwise unworthy, hereupon to abstain from communicating with such a church in the participation of the sacraments is unlawful. For as it were unreasonable for an innocent person to be punished for the faults of others, wherein he hath no hand, and whereunto he gave no consent; so is it more unrea∣sonable, that a godly man should neglect duty, and punish himself, in not coming for his portion in the blessing of the sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, as he ought, because others are suffered to come, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t ought no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; especially considering that himself doth neither consent to their sins, nor to their approaching to the ordinance in their sin, nor to the neglect of others

who shall put them away, and do not; but on the con∣trary, doth heartily mourn for these things, modestly and seasonably stir up others to do their duty. If the church cannot be reformed, they may use their liberty, as is spe∣cified, chap. 13. sect. 4. But this all the godly are bound unto, even every one to do his endeavour, accord∣ing to his power and place, that the unworthy m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y be duly proceeded against by the church, to whom this matter doth appertain, 2 Chron. 30.18. Gen. 18.25. Ezek. 9.4.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Of the communion of churches one with another.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH churches be distinct and therefore may not be confounded one with another, and equal, and therefore have not dominion one over another; yet all the churches ought to preserve church communion one with another, because they are all united unto Christ, not only as a mystical but as a political head, whence is derived a communion suitable thereunto. Rev. 1.4. Cant. 8.8. Rom. 16.16. 1 Cor. 16.19. Acts 15.23. Rev. 2.1.</P>
<P N="2">2. The communion of churches is excercised sundry ways. 1. By way of mutual care, in taking thought for one anothers welfare. 2. By way of consultation one with another, when we have occasion to require the judg∣ment and counsel of other churches, touching any person or cause wherewith they may be better acquainted than our∣selves. As the church at Antioch consulted with the apostles and elders of the church at Jerusalem, about the question of circumcision of the Gentiles, and about the false teachers that broached that doctrine. In which case, when any church wanted light or peace amongst themselves, it is a way of communion of churches (according to the word) ta meet together, by their elders and other messengers in a synod, to consider and argue the points in doubt or dif∣ference; and having found out the way of truth and peace, to commend the same by their let<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and messengers to
<PB N="222" REF="012626_0221_0F8B9341D9085B10"/>
the churches whom the same may concern. But if a church be rent with divisions among themselves, or lie under any open scandal, and yet refuse to consult with other churches for healing or removing of the same, it is matter of just offence both to the Lord Jesus, and to other churches, as bewraying too much want of mercy and faithfulness, not to seek to bind up the breaches and wounds of the church and brethren; and therefore the state of such a church calleth aloud upon o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her churches to exercise a fuller act of brotherly communion, to wit, by way of admonition. 3. A third way of communion of churches is by way of admonition, to wit, in case any public offence be found in a church, which either discern not or are slow in proceed∣ing to use means for the removing and healing thereof. Paul had no authority over Peter, yet when he saw Peter not walking with a right foot, he publickly rebuked him before the church. Though churches have no more authority one over another, than one apostle had over ano∣ther, yet as one apostle might admonish another, so may one church admonish another, and yet without usur∣pation. In which case, if the church that lieth under offence, do not hearken to the church that doth admonish her, the church is to acquaint other neighbour churches with that offence which the offending church still lieth un∣der, together with the neglect of their brotherly admoni∣tion given unto them; whereupon those other churches are to join in seconding the admonition formerly given; and if still the offending church continue in obstina∣cy and impenitency, they may forbear communion with them, and are to proceed to make use of the help of a synod, or council of neighbour churches walking orderly (if a greater cannot conveniently be had) for their con∣viction. If they hear not the synod, the synod having de∣clared them too obstinate, particular churches approving and accepting the judgment of the synod, are to declare the sentence of non-communion respectively concerning them; and thereupon, out of a religious care to keep their own communion pure, they may justly withdraw themselves from participation with them at the Lord's table, and from such other acts of holy communion as the communi∣on of churches doth otherwise allow and require. Never∣theless, if any members of such a church as live under
<PB N="223" REF="012626_0222_0F8B93428A88A3D8"/>
public offence, do not consent to the offence of the church, but do in due sort bear witness against it, they are still to be received to wonted communion; for it is not equal that the innocent should suffer with the offensive. Yea, furthermore, if such innocent members, after due waiting in the use of all good means for the healing of the offence of their own church, shall at l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t (with the allowance of the council of neighbour churches) withdraw from the fellow∣ship of their own church, and offer themselves to the fel∣lowship of another, we judge it lawful for the other church to receive them (being otherwise fit) as if they had been orderly dismissed to them from their own church. 4. A fourth w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of communion of churches is by way of parti∣cipation. The members of one church occasionally coming to another, we willingly admit them to partake with us at the Lord's table, it being the seal of our communion, not only with Christ, nor only with the members of our own churches, but also of all the churches of the saints; in which regard we refuse not to baptize their children presented to us, if either their own minister, be absent, or such a fruit of holy fellowship be desired with us. In like case, such churches as are furnished with more ministers than one, do willingly afford one of their own ministers to supply the place of an absent or sick minister of another church for a needful season. 5. A fifth way of church communion, is by way of recommendation, when the member of one church hath occasion to reside in another church, if but for a season, we commend him to their watchful fellowship, by letters of recommendation, but if he be called to settle his abode there, we commit him according to his desire, to the fellowship of their covenant, by letters of dismission. 6. A sixth way of church communion is in case of need, to minister relief and succour one unto another, either of able members, to furnish them with officers, or of outward support, to the necessities of poorer churches, as did the churches of the Gentiles contribute liberally to the poor saints at Jerusalem. Cant. 8.8. Acts 15.2, 6, 22, 23. Ezek. 34.4. Gal. 2.11 to 14. Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. by proportion. Gen. 18.25. 1 Cor. 12.13. Rom. 16.1. Acts 18.27. and 11.22, 29. Rom. 13.26, 27.</P>
<P N="3">3. When a company of believers purpose to gather in∣to a church fellowship, it is requisite for their safer pro∣ceeding,
<PB N="224" REF="012626_0223_0F8B93434400AC68"/>
and the maintaining the communion of churches, that they signify their intent unto the neighbour churches, walking according unto the order of the gospel, and desire their presence, and help, and right hand of fellowship, which they ought readily to give unto them, when there is no just cause to except against their proceedings. Gal. 2.1, 2. and 9. by proportion.</P>
<P N="4">4. Besides these several ways of communion, there is also a way of propagation of churches: when a church shall grow too numerous, it is a way, and fit season to propagate one church out of another, by sending forth such of their members as are willing to remove, and to procure some officers to them, as may enter with them into church estate amongst themselves. As bees, when the hive is too full, issue forth by swarms, and are gathered into o∣ther hives, so the churches of Christ may do the same upon like necessity; and therein hold forth to them the right hand of fellowship, both in their gathering into a church, and in the ordination of their officers, Isa. 40.20. Cant. 8.8.9.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. Of Synods.</HEAD>
<P>SYNODS orderly assembled, and rightly proceeding according to the pattern, Acts 15, we acknowledge as the ordinance of Christ; and tho' not absolutely necessary to the being, yet many times, through the ini∣quity of men, and preverseness of times, necessary to the well-being of churches, for the establishment of truth and peace therein, Acts 15.2 to 15.</P>
<P N="2">2. Synods being spiritual and ecclesiastical assemblies, are therefore made up of spiritual and ecclesiastical causes. The next efficient cause of them under Christ, is the power of the churches, sending forth their elders and other mes∣sengers, who being met together in the name of Christ, are the matter of a synod: and they in arguing, debating, and determining matters of religion according to the word, and publishing the same to the churches it concerneth, do put forth the proper and formal acts of a synod, to the
<PB N="225" REF="012626_0224_0F8B9344046B7C28"/>
conviction of errors and heresies, and the establishment of truth and peace in the churches, which is the end of a synod, Acts 15.2, 3, 6, 7, to 23, 31. and 16.4, 15.</P>
<P N="3">3. Magistrates have power to call a synod, by calling to the churches to send forth their elders, and other mes∣sengers, to counsel, and assist them in matters of religion; but yet the constituting of a synod is a church act, and may be transacted by the churches even when civil magistrates may be enemies to the churches, and church-assemblies, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 19.4, 5, to 11. <HI>Acts.</HI> 15.</P>
<P N="4">4. It belongeth unto synods and councils, to debate and determine controversies of faith, and cases of conscience; to clear from the word holy directions for the holy wor∣ship of God, and good government of the church; to bear witness against male administration and corruption in doctrine or manners in any particular church; and to give directions for the reformation thereof; not to exercise church censures in way of discipline, nor any other act of church authority or jurisdiction, which that presidential synod did forbear, <HI>Acts.</HI> 15.1, 2, 6, 7. 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 15, 13. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.6, 7. <HI>Acts</HI> 15.24, 28, 29.</P>
<P N="5">5. The synods directions and determinations so far as consonant to the word of God, are to be received with re∣verence and submission; not only fort heir agreement there∣with (which is the principal ground thereof, and without which they bind not at all) but also secondarily for the power where by they are made, as being an ordinance of God appointed thereunto in his word, <HI>Acts</HI> 15.</P>
<P N="6">6. Because it is difficult, if not impossible, for many churches to come together in one place, in all their mem∣bers universally; therefore they may assemble by their de∣legates or messengers; as the church at <HI>Antioch</HI> went not all to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> but some select men for that purpose. Be∣cause none are or should be more fit to know the state of the churches nor to advise of ways for the good thereof, than elders; therefore it is fit that in the choice of the mes∣sengers for such assemblies they have special respect unto such; yet inasmuch as not only Paul and Barnabas, but certain others also were sent to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> from <HI>Antioch,</HI> and when they were come to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> not only the
<PB N="226" REF="012626_0225_0F8B9344CF3F80E0"/>
apostles and elders, but other brethren also do assemble and meet about the matter; therefore synods are to consist both of elders, and other church members endued with gifts, and sent by the churches, not excluding the presence of any brethren in the churches, <HI>Acts</HI> 15.2, 22, 23.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="17" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Of the civil magistrates power in matters ecclesiastical.</HEAD>
<P>IT is lawful, profitable and necessary for christians to ga∣ther themselves together into church estate, and there∣in to exercise all the ordinances of Christ, according unto the word, although the consent of the magistrate could not be had thereunto; because the apostles and chris∣tians in their time did frequently thus practise, when the magistrates all of them being <HI>Jewish</HI> or <HI>Pagan,</HI> and most persecuting enemies, would give no countenance or con∣sent to such matters, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.41, 47. and 4.1, 2, 3.</P>
<P N="2">2. Church government stands in no opposition to civil government of common-wealths, nor any way intrencheth upon the authority of civil magistrates in their jurisdiction; nor any whit weakneth their hands in governing, but ra∣ther strengtheneth them, furthereth the people in yielding more hearty and conscionable obedience unto them whatso∣ever some ill affected persons to the ways of Christ have suggested, to alienate the affection of kings and princes from the ordinances of Christ; as if the kingdom of Christ in his church could not rise and stand without the falling and weakening of their government, which is also of Christ; whereas the contrary is most true, that they may both stand together and flourish, the one being helpful unto the other, in their distinct and due administrations. <HI>John</HI> 18.36. <HI>Acts</HI> 25.8. <HI>Isa.</HI> 49.23.</P>
<P N="3">3. The power and authority of magistrates is not for the restraining of churches, or any other good works, but for helping in and furthering thereof; and therefore the con∣sent and countenance of magistrates, when it may be had,
<PB N="227" REF="012626_0226_0F8B934586EE5678"/>
is not to be slighted or lightly esteemed; but on the con∣tary, it is part of that honor due to christian magistrates to desire and crave there consent and approbation therein, which being obtained, the churches may then proceed in their way with more encouragement and comfort. <HI>Rom.</HI> 13, 4. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.2.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is not in the power of magistrates to compel their subjects to become church members, and to partake at the Lord's table; for the priests are reproved that brought un∣worthy ones into the sanctuary: Then as it was unlawful for the priest, so it is as unl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wful to be done by civil ma∣gistrates, those whom the church cast out it they were in, the magistrate ought not to thrust them into the church, nor to hold them therein, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 44.7.9. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.11.</P>
<P N="5">5. As it is unlawful for church officers to meddle with the sword of the magistrate, so it is unlawful for the ma∣gistrate to meddle with the work proper to church officers. The acts of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> who were not only princes, but prophets, were extraordinary, therefore not imitable. Against such usurpation, the Lord witnessed by smiting <HI>Uzziah</HI> with leprosy, for presuming to offer incense. <HI>Mat.</HI> 2.25, 26. 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26.16, 17.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is the duty of the magistrate to take care of mat∣ters of religion, and to improve his civil authority for the observing of the duties commanded in the first, as well as for observing of the duties commanded in the second ta∣ble. They are called Gods. The end of the magistrates office, is not only the quiet and peaceable life of the sub∣ject in matters of righteousness and honesty, but also in matters of godliness. <HI>Moses, Joshua, David, Solomon, As<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Jehosaphat, Hezekiah, Josiah,</HI> are much commended by the Holy Ghost for the putting forth their authority in matters of religion: On the contrary, such kings as have been failing this way, are frequently taxed and reproved by the Lord. And not only the kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> but also <HI>Job, Nehemiah</HI> the king of <HI>Nineveh, Darius, Artaxerres, Nebu∣chadnezzar,</HI> whom none looked at as types of Christ, (though were it so, there were no place for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> objec∣tion)
<PB N="228" REF="012626_0227_0F8B9346535CC980"/>
are commended in the book of God, for exercising their authority this way, <HI>Psalm.</HI> 82.8. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.1, 2. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 15.14. and 22.43. 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 12.3. and 14, 4. and. 15.35. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 20.42. <HI>Job</HI> 29.25. and 31.26, 28. <HI>Neb.</HI> 13. <HI>Jonah</HI> 3.7. <HI>Ezra.</HI> 7. <HI>Dan.</HI> 3.29.</P>
<P N="7">7. The objects of the power of the magistrate are not things meerly inward, and so not subject to his cogni∣zance and view, as unbelief, hardness of heart, erroneous opinions not vented, but only such things as are acted by the outward man; neither is their power to be exercised in commanding such acts of the outward man, and punish∣ing the neglect thereof; as are but meer inventions &amp; devices of men, but about such acts as are commanded and forbidden in the word; yea, such as the word doth clearly determine, though not always clearly to the judgment of the magistrate or others, yet clearly in itself. In these he of right ought to put forth his authority, though oft-times actually he doth it not. 1 Kings 20.28, 42.</P>

<P>Being some collections for the information of those that are not acquainted with the principles and practices of the first and most eminent leaders, in the churches of CHRIST in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>THE platform of church discipline, was agreed on and consented unto by many great, learned and pious persons, from the four famous colonies in <HI>New-England,</HI> assembled in the synod at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> 1648. Something of which may be read in a late print, entitled, <HI>A Testimony to the Order of the Gospel in the Churches of</HI> New-England.</P>
<P>The deservedly famous and reverend Mr. <HI>John Wilson</HI> pastor, and <HI>John Cotton</HI> teacher of the first church of Christ in <HI>Boston,</HI> were two of those worthies that compo∣sed the platform of church discipline.</P>
<P>The reverend Mr. <HI>John Norton,</HI> teacher of the said church in <HI>Boston,</HI> in his election sermon, <HI>May</HI> 22, 1661, page 12, gives this advice, "Take care that the order of the gospel may have a free passage in the churches; I mean that our practice may effectually answer our doc∣trine, in that book, entitled, The Platform of CHURCH DISCIPLINE."</P>
<P>And in his last sermon, preached on his weekly lecture, <HI>April</HI> 2, 1663, a little before his death, page 37, "Re∣member that we have the pattern in the mount, I mean we have the scripture as a rule, and you have the Platform of Church Discipline given to you in way of council, as the Confession of our Faith to this way of church govern∣ment: You know in what manner it was that which (for the substance of it) owns the cause congregational: If any are departed from it let them look to it."</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="012626_0229_0F8B9347CD6F1E10"/>The reveerend Mr. <HI>John Davenport,</HI> in his catechism, printed <HI>Anno</HI> 1669, for the use of the first church in <HI>Bos∣ton,</HI> of which he was then pastor, shows his concurrence with the Platform of Church Discipline in matters relating to church government.</P>
<P>The reverend Mr. <HI>John Oxenbridge,</HI> pastor of said church, by his practice manifested his consent to the way of church government, as it is stated in the Platform of Church Discipline: And in his election sermon in <HI>May</HI> 1671, declared his agreement with the principles of puri∣ty and power of the churches.</P>
<P>The reverend Mr. <HI>James Allen,</HI> teacher of said church, in his election sermon, <HI>May</HI> 28, 1679, page 10, 11. Having taken notice of the Platform of Church Discipline, as manifesting the judgment of the ministers of <HI>New-En∣gland,</HI> asserting the authoritative rule of the elders, with the liberty of the brethren, expresseth himself thus, 'Though the judgment of the best should not be looked upon as scripture <HI>Canons,</HI> nor bind any further than it is found agreeing with the word of God, by which it ought to be tried; yet I think I may safely say, that is a clearer judgment of the mind of God in the scripture, in that matter, than can be expected in the next generation. It is true, in improvements of natural light, that may be increased by industry, and those that stand upon others shoulders may see further than they did upon whose shoul∣ders they stand, but it is not so in spiritual things, the fur∣ther knowledge of which depends upon revelation." Eph. 1.17. Psal. 25.9.</P>
<P>The reverend and learned Mr. <HI>Urian Oakes,</HI> president of Harvard-college, and pastor of the church of Christ in Cambridge, in his election sermon, <HI>May</HI> 7, 1673. p. 48. declared himself as follows, "I beg that we may keep the King's high way, the way that Christ himself hath cast up for us, and that our worthy predecessors have travelled in before us, the way that hath been stated, not in the pri∣vate models of some fanciful and conceited men, but in the Platform of Church Discipline; the truest understand∣ing of these things is from the Platform deduced out of the word of GOD,"</P>

<HEAD>A PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lord Jesus Christ witnessed a good confessi∣on, at the time when he said, To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth; and be taketh notice of it, to the praise and high commen∣dation of the church in <HI>Pergamus,</HI> that they held fast his name, and had not denied his Faith. Nor are they worthy the name of christians, who, though the Lord by his Provi∣dence call them publickly to own the truth they have professed, shall nevertheless refuse to declare what they believe, as to those great and fundamental principles in the doctrine of Christ, the knowledge whereof is necessary unto salvation. We find how ready the apostle was to make A Confession of his Faith; though for that hope's sake he was accused and put in chains. And the martyr's of Jesus, who have laid down their lives in bearing witness to the truth, against the infidelity, idolatry, heresy, apostacy of the world, when Pa∣gan, Arian, or overspread with Popish darkness: Having their feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace, were free and forward in their testimony, confessing the truth, yea, sealing it with their blood. With the heart man be∣lieveth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation, <HI>Rom. 10.10.</HI> Nor is there a greater evidence of being in a state of salvation, than such a confessi∣on, if made in times or places where men are exposed to utmost suffering upon that account. <HI>1 John, 4.15.</HI> And if Con∣fession of faith be, in some cases, of such importance and necessi∣ty, as hath been expressed; it must needs be in itself, a work pleasing in the sight of God, for his servants to declare unto the world, what those principles of truth are, which they have received, and are (by the help of Christ) purposed to live and die in the stedfast profession of. Some of the Lord's worthies have been of renown among his people in this re∣spect;
<PB REF="012626_0234_0F8B934D0C73FD00"/>
especially <HI>Iraenius</HI> and <HI>Athanasius</HI> of old, and of latter times <HI>Beza,</HI> all whose (not to mention others) Confessions, with the advantage which the church of God hath received thereby, are famously known.</P>
<P>And it must needs tend much to the honor of the dear and blessed name of the Lord Jesus, in case many churches do join together in their testimony. How signally the Lord hath owned the Confession of the four general Synods or Councils for the suppression of the heresies of those times, needs not to be said, since no man can be ignorant thereof, that hath made it his concern to be acquainted with things of this nature. The Confession of the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> of the <HI>Waldenses,</HI> and of the reformed protestant churches abroad, (which also, to shew what harmony in respect of doctrine there is among all sincere professors of the truth, have been published in one volume) all these have been of singular use, not only to those that lived in the ages when these declarations were emitted, but unto posterity, yea, unto this day.</P>
<P>There have been some who have reflected upon these New-English churches for our defect in this matter, as if our prin∣ciples were unknown; whereas it is well-known, that as to matters of doctrine we agree with other r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>formed churches: Nor was it that, but what concerns worship and discipline, that caused our fathers to come into the wilderness, while it was a land not sown, that so they might have liberty to practise accordingly. And it is a ground of holy rejoicing before the Lord, that now there is no advantage left for those that may be dissaffected towards us, to object any thing of that nature against us. For it hath pleased the only wise God so to dispose in his Providence, as that the elders and messengers of the churches in the colony of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> did, by the call and encouragement of the honored General Court, meet together <HI>Sept. 10, 1679.</HI></P>
<P>This synod at their 2d session, which was <HI>May 12, 1680,</HI> consulted and considered of a Confession of Faith. That which was consented unto by the elders and messengers of the
<PB REF="012626_0235_0F8B934DDC885240"/>
congregational churches in <HI>England,</HI> who met at at the <HI>Sa∣voy,</HI> (being for the most part, some small variations except∣ed, the same with that which was agreed upon first by the Assembly at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and was approved of by the Synod at <HI>Cambridge</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> Anno <HI>1648,</HI> as also by a General Assembly in <HI>Scotland</HI>) was twice publickly read, examined and approved of: that little variation which we have made from the one, in compliance with the other may be seen by those who please to compare them. But we have (for the main) chosen to express ourselves in the words of those Reverend Assemblies, that so we might not only with one heart, but with one mouth glorify God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>As to what concerns church-government, we refer to the Platform of Discipline agreed upon by the elders and messen∣gers of these churches, Anno <HI>1648,</HI> and solemnly owned and confirmed by the late Synod.</P>
<P>What hours of temptation may overtake these churches, is not for us to say. Only the Lord doth many times so order things, that when his people have made a good Confession, they shall be put upon the trial one way or other, to see whether they have (or who among them hath not) been sin∣cere in what they have done.</P>
<P>The LORD grant that the loins of our minds may be so girt about with truth, that we may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the holy Scripture.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH the light of nature, and the works of creation and providence, do so far manifest the good∣ness, wisdom and power of God, as to leave men unexcusable; yet are they not sufficient to give that know∣ledge of God and of his will, which is necessary unto sal∣vation: Therefore it pleased the Lord at sundry times, and in diverse manners to reveal himself, and to declare that his will unto his church; &amp; afterwards for the better preserving and propagating of the truth, and for the more sure establishment and comfort of the church against the corruption of the flesh, and the malice of satan and of the world, to commit the same wholly to writing: Which maketh the holy scripture to be most necessary; those for∣mer ways of God's revealing his will unto his people being now ceased.</P>
<P N="2">2. Under the name of holy scripture, or the word of God written, are now contained all the the books of the old and new testament, which are these:</P>
<P>Of the Old Testament.</P>
<P>Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, The Song of Songs, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zachariah, Malachi.</P>
<P>Of the New Testament.</P>
<P>Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, the Acts of the apostles, Pauls epistle to the Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalo∣nians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 to Timothy, 2 to Timothy, to Titus, to Philemon, The epistle to the Hebrews, the epistle of James, the first and second epistles of Peter, the first se∣cond and third epistles of John, the epistle of Jude, the Re∣velation.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="012626_0237_0F8B934F5CCCA670"/>All which are given by the inspiration of God to be the rule of faith and life.</P>
<P N="3">3. The books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are no part of the canon of the scripture; and therefore are of no authority in the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved or made use of.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, for which it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deth not upon the testimony of any man or church, but wholly upon God (who is truth it self) the author thereof; and therefore it is to be received, because it is the word of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. We may be moved and induced by the testimony of the church, to an high and reverened esteem of the holy scripture. And the heavenliness of the matter, the efficacy of the doctrine, the majesty of the style, the consent of all the parts, the scope of the whole (which is, to give all glory to God) the full discovery it makes of the only way of mans salvation, the many other incomparable excellen∣cies, and the entire perfection thereof, are arguments whereby it doth abundantly evidence it self to be the word of God; yet notwithstanding, our full preswasion and as∣surance of the infallible truth and divine authority thereof, is from the inward work of the holy spirit, bearing witness by and with the word in our hearts.</P>
<P N="6">6. The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man's salvation, faith and and life, is either set down in scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from scripture; unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men. Never∣theless we acknowledge the inward illumination of the Spirit of God to be necessary for the saving understanding of such things as are revealed in the world: And that there are some circumstances concerning the worship of God and government of the church, common to human actions and societies, which are to be ordered by the light of nature, and christian prudence, according to the general rules of the word, which are always to be observed.</P>
<P N="7">7. All things in scripture are not alike plain in them∣selves, nor alike clear unto all: Yet those things which are ne∣cessary to be known, believed and observed for salvation, are so clearly propounded and opened in some place of
<PB N="241" REF="012626_0238_0F8B9350131B1530"/>
scripture or other, that not only the learned, but the un∣learned, in a due use of the ordinary means, may attain unto a sufficient understanding of them.</P>
<P N="8">8. The old testament in <HI>Hebrew,</HI> (which was the native language of the people of God of old) and the new testament in <HI>Greek,</HI> (which at the time of writing of it was most generally known to the nations) being immediately inspired by God, &amp; by his singular care &amp; providence kept pure in all ages, are therefore authentical; so as in all con∣troversies of religion, the church is finally to appeal unto them. But because these original tongues are not known to all the people of God, who have right unto and interest in the scriptures, and are commanded in the fear of God to read and search them; therefore they are to be transla∣ted into the vulgar language of every nation unto which they come, that the word of God dwelling plentifully in all, they may worship him in an acceptable manner, and through patience and comfort of the scriptures may have hope.</P>
<P N="9">9. The infallible rule of interpretation of scripture, is the scripture it self; and therefore when there is a ques∣tion about the true and full sense of any scripture (which is not manifold, but one) it must be searched and known by other places, that speak more clearly.</P>
<P N="10">10. The supream judge by which all controversies of re∣ligion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other, but the holy scriptures delivered by the Spirit; into which scripture so delivered, our faith is finally resolved.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of God, and of the Holy Trinity.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is but one only living and true God; who is infinite in being and perfection, a most pure Spirit, invisible, without body, parts, or passions, immutable, immense, eternal, incomprehensible, almigh∣ty, most wise, most holy, most free, most absolute, work∣ing all things according to the counsel of his own immu∣table and most righteous will, for his own glory, most
<PB N="242" REF="012626_0239_0F8B9350C46F19F0"/>
loving, gracious, merciful, long-suffering, abundant in goodness and truth, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin, the rewarder of them that diligently seek him, and withal, most just and terrible in his judgments, hating all sin, and who will by no means clear the guilty.</P>
<P N="2">2. God hath all life, glory, goodness, blessedness, in, and of himself; and is alone in, and unto himself, all-sufficient, not standing in need of any creatures which he hath made, nor deriving any glory from them, but only manifesting his own glory in, by, unto and upon them. He is the alone fountain of all being, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things; and hath most sov∣reign dominion over them, to do by them, for them, or upon them, whatsoever himself pleaseth: In his sight all things are open and manifest, his knowledge is infinite, infallible and independent upon the creature, so as noth∣ing is to him contingent or uncertain. He is most holy in all his counsels, in all his works, and in all his com∣mands. To him is due from angels and men, and every other creature, whatsoever worship, service or obedience, as creatures, they owe unto the creator, and whatever he is further pleased to require of them.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the unity of the God-head there be three per∣sons, of one substance, power, and eternity, God the Fa∣ther, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost: The Fa∣ther is of none, neither begotten, nor proceeding: The Son is eternally begotten of the Father: The Holy Ghost eternally proceeding from the Father and the Son. Which doctrine of the Trinity is the foundation of all our com∣munion with God, and comfortable dependance upon him.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III. Of God's eternal Decree.</HEAD>
<P>GOD from all eternity did by the most wise and holy counsel of his own will, freely and unchangably or∣dain whatsoever comes to pass: Yet so, as there∣by neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures, nor is the liberty or contin∣gency of second causes taken away, but rather established.</P>
<P N="2">2. Although God knows whatsoever may or can come to pass upon all supposed conditions, yet hath he not de∣creed
<PB N="243" REF="012626_0240_0F8B935197C62E80"/>
any thing, because he foresaw it as future, or as that which would come to pass upon such conditions.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the decree of God for the manifestation of his glory, some men and angels are predestinated unto ever∣lasting life, and others fore-ordained to everlasting death.</P>
<P N="4">4. These angels and men thus predestinated, and fore-ordained, are particularly and unchangeably designed, and their number is so certain and definite, that it cannot be either increased or diminished.</P>
<P N="5">5. Those of mankind that are predestinated unto life, God before the foundation of the world was laid, accord∣ing to his eternal and immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and good pleasure of his will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting glory, out of his meer free grace and love, without any foresight of faith or good works, or perseve∣rence in either of them, or any other thing in the creature, as conditions or causes moving him thereunto, and all to the praise of his glorious grace.</P>
<P N="6">6. As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath he by the eternal and most free purpose of his will fore-ordained all the means thereunto: Wherefore they who are elected, being fallen in <HI>Adam,</HI> are redeemed by Christ, are effectually called unto faith in Christ by his Spirit working in due season, are justified, adopted, sanctified, and kept by his power, through faith, unto salvation. Neither are any other redeemed by Christ, or effectually called, justified, adopted, sanctified and saved, but the elect only.</P>
<P N="7">7. The rest of mankind God has pleased, according to the unsearchable counsel of his own will, whereby h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> extendeth or with-holdeth mercy, as he pleaseth, for the glory of his sovereign power over his creatures, to pass by, and to ordain them to dishonor and wrath for their sin, to the praise of his glorious justice.</P>
<P N="7">7. The doctrine of this high mystery of predestination, is to be handled with special prudence and care, that men attending the will of God revealed in his word, and yield∣ing obedience thereunto, may from the certainty of their effectual vocation, be assured of their eternal election. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall this doctrine afford matter of praise, reverence and admiration of God, and of humility, diligence, and abun∣dant consolation to all that sincerely obey the gospel.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of Creation.</HEAD>
<P>IT pleased God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, for the manifestation of the glory of his eternal power, wisdom and goodness, in the beginning to create or make of nothing the world, and all things therein, whe∣ther visible or invisible, in the space of six days, and all very good.</P>
<P N="2">2. Af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er God had made all other creatures, he created man, male and female, with reasonable and immortal souls, endued with knowledge, righteousness and true holiness, after his own image, having the law of God written in their heart, and power to fulfil it; and yet under a possibility of transgressing, being left to the liberty of their own will, which was subject to change. Besides this law written in their hearts, they received a command not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; which while they kept, they were happy in their communion with God, and had dominion over the creatures.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V. Of Providence.</HEAD>
<P>GOD the great creator of all things, doth uphold, di∣rect, dispose and govern all creatures, actions, and things from the greatest even to the least, by his most wise and holy Providence, according to his infallible fore-knowledge, and the free and immutable counsel of his own will, to the praise of the glory of his wisdom, power, justice, goodness and mercy.</P>
<P N="2">2. Although in relation to the fore-knowledge and de∣cree of God, the first cause, all things come to pass immu∣tably, and infallibly; yet by the same Providence he or∣dereth them to fall out, according to the nature of second causes, either necessarily, freely, or contingently.</P>
<P N="3">3. God in his ordinary Providence maketh use of means, yet is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ree to work without, above, and against them at his pleasure.</P>
<P N="4">4. The almighty power, unsearchable wisdom and the infinite goodness of God, so far manifest themselves in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="245" REF="012626_0242_0F8B9353035C5618"/>
Providence, in that his determinate counsel extend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th itself even to the first fall, and all other sins of angels and men, (and that not by a bare permission) which also he most wisely and powerfully boundeth, and otherwise ordereth and governeth in a manifold dispensation, to his own most holy ends, yet so as the sinfulness thereof proceedeth only from the creature, and not from God, who being most ho∣ly and righteous neither is, nor can be the author or ap∣prover of sin.</P>
<P N="5">5. The most wise, righteous and gracious God doth oftentimes leave for a season his own children to manifold temptations, and the corruption of their own hearts, to chastise them for their former sins, or to discover unto them the hidden strength of corruption, and deceitfulness of their hearts, that they may be humbled, and to raise them to a more close and constant dependance for their support upon himself, and to make them more watchful against all future occasions of sin, and for sundry other just and holy ends.</P>
<P N="6">6. As for those wicked and ungodly men, whom God as a righteous judge for former sins, doth blind and hard∣en, from them he not only with-holdeth his grace, where∣by they might have been enlightened in their understand∣ings, and wrought upon in their hearts; but sometimes also withdraweth the gifts which they had, and exposeth them to such objects, as their corruption makes occasions of sin; and withal gives them over to their own lusts, the temptations of the world, and the power of Satan, where∣by it comes to pass that they harden themselves, even un∣der those means which God useth for the softning of others.</P>
<P N="7">7. As the Providence of God doth in general reach to all creatures, so after a most special manner it taketh care of his church, and disposeth all things for the good thereof.</P>

<P>GOD having made a covenant of works and life there∣upon, with our first parents, and all their posterity in them, they being seduced by the subtilty and temptation of satan, did willfully transgress the law of their creation, and break the covenant in eating the forbid∣den fruit.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of God's Covenant with Man.</HEAD>
<P>THE distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures, do owe obedience to him as their creator, yet they could never have attained the reward of life, but by some volun∣tary condescention on God's part, which he hath been pleas∣ed to express by way of covenant.</P>
<P N="2">2. The first covenant made with man, was a covenant of works, wherein life was promised to <HI>Adam,</HI> and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal o∣bedience.</P>
<P N="3">3. Man by his fall having made himself uncapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace; wherein he freely offereth unto sinners life and salvation by Jesus

<P N="5">5. Although this covenant hath been differently and variously administred in respect of ordinances and instituti∣ons in the time of the law, and since the coming of Christ in the flesh; yet for the substance and efficacy of it, to all its spiritual and saving ends, it is one and the same; upon the account of which various dispensations, it is called the old and new testament.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP.VIII. Of Christ the Mediator.</HEAD>
<P>IT pleased God in his eternal purpose, to chuse and or∣dain the Lord Jesus his only begotten Son, according to a covenant made between them both, to be the mediator between God and man; the prophet, priest, and king, the head and Saviour of his church, the heir of all things, and judge of the world: Unto whom he did from all eternity give a people to be his seed, &amp; to be by him in time re∣deemed, called, justified sanctified and glorified.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Son of God, the second person in the Trinity, being very and eternal God, of one substance, and equal with the Father, did, when the fullness of time was come, take upon him mans nature, with all the essential proper∣ties and common infirmities thereof, yet without sin, being conceived by the power of the holy Ghost in the womb of the virgin Mary, of her substance: So that two whole per∣fect and distinct natures, the godhead and the manhood▪ were inseperably joined together in one person, without conversion, composition, or confusion; which person, is very God and very man, yet one Christ, the only mediator between God and man.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord Jesus in his human nature, thus united to the divine in the person of the Son; was sanctified and anoint∣ed
<PB N="248" REF="012626_0245_0F8B935543796B68"/>
with the holy Spirit above measure; having in him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, in whom it pleas∣ed the Father that all fullness should dwell, to the end that being holy, harmless, undefiled and full of grace &amp; truth, he might be throughly furnished to execute the office of a mediator and surety; which office he took not unto him∣self, but was thereunto called by his Father, who also put all power &amp; judgement into his hand, and gave him com∣mandment to execute the same.</P>
<P N="4">4. This office the Lord Jesus Christ did most willingly undertake; which that he might discharge, he was made under the law, and did perfectly fulfil it, and un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> went the punishment due to us which we should have borne and suffered, being made sin and a curse for us, enduring most grievous torments immediately from God in his soul, and most painful sufferings in his body, was crucified, and died, was buried and remained under the power of death, yet saw no corruption, on the third day he arose from the dead with the same body in which he suffered, with which also he ascended into heaven, and there sitteth at the right hand of his Father, making intercession, and shall return to judge men and angels at the end of the world.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Lord Jesus by his perfect obedience and sacri∣fice of himself, which he through the eternal Spirit once offered up unto God, hath fully satisfied the justice of God, and purchased not only reconciliation, but an everlasting inheritance in the kingdom of heaven, for all those whom the Father hath given unto him.</P>
<P N="6">6. Although the work of redemption was not actually by Christ till after his incarnation, yet the virtue, efficacy and benefits thereof communicated to the elect in all ages successively from the be beginning of the world, in and by those promises, types and sacrifices wherein he was reveal∣ed and signified to be the seed of the woman, which should bruise the serpents head, and the lamb slain from the be∣ginning of the world, being yesterday and to day the same, and for ever.</P>
<P N="7">7. Christ in the work of mediation acteth according to both natures, by each nature doing that which is proper to it self; yet by reason of the unity of the person, that which is proper to one nature, is sometimes in scripture attributed to the person denomin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed by the other na∣ture.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="249" REF="012626_0246_0F8B93561D5D0F30"/>8. To all those for whom Christ hath purchased re∣demption, he doth certainly and effectually apply and communicate the same, making intercession for them, and revealing unto them in &amp; by the word mysteries of salva∣on, effectually perswading them by his Spirit to believe and obey, and governing their hearts by his word and Spirit, overcoming all their enemies by his almighty power &amp; wisdom, in such manner and ways as are most conso∣nant to his wonderful and unsearchable dispensation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of Free-Will.</HEAD>
<P>GOD hath endued the will of man with that natural liberty &amp; power of acting upon choice, that it is neither forced, nor by any absolute necessity of na∣ture determined to do good or evil.</P>
<P N="2">2. Man in his state of innocency had freedom and power to will and to do that which was good and well pleasing to God; but yet mutably, so that he might fall from it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Man by his fall into a state of sin, hath wholly lost all ability of will to any spiritual good accompanying sal∣vation, so as a natural man being altogether averse from that good, and dead in sin, is not able by his own strength to convert himself, or to prepare himself thereunto.</P>
<P N="4">4. When God converts a sinner, and translates him into a state of grace, he freeth him from his natural bondage under sin, and by his grace alone enables him freely to will and to do that which is spiritually good; yet so, as that by reason of his remaining corruption, he doth not perfectly nor only will that which is good, but doth also will that which is evil.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of Effectual Calling.</HEAD>
<P>ALL those whom God hath predestinated unto life, and those only, he is pleased in his appointed and accepted time, effectually to call by his word and spirit, out of that state of sin and death in which they are by nature, to grace and salvation by Jesus Christ, enlight∣ening their minds spiritually and savingly to understand the things of God, taking away their heart of stone, and giving unto them an heart of flesh, renewing their wills, and by his almighty power determining them to that which is good, and effectually drawing them to Jesus Christ: Yet so, as they come most freely, being made willing by his grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. This effectual call is of God's free and special grace alone, not from any thing at all foreseen in man, who is al∣together passive therein, until being quickened and renew∣ed by the holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to answer this call, and to embrace the grace offered and conveyed in it.</P>
<P N="3">3.

<P N="4">4. Others not elected, although they may be called by the ministry of the word, and may have some common operations of the Spirit, yet not being effectually drawn by the Father, they neither do nor can come unto Christ, and therefore cannot be saved; much less can men not professing the christian religion, be saved in any other way whatsoever, be they never so diligent to frame their lives according to the light of nature, and the law of that reli∣gion they do profess: And to assert and maintain that they may, is very pernicious, and to be detested.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of Justification.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE whom God effectually calleth, he also freely justifieth, not by infusing righteousness into them, but by pardoning their sins, and by accounting and accepting their persons as righteous, not for any thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ's sake alone; nor by imputing faith itself, the act of believing, or any other evangelical obedience to them, as their righteousness, but by imputing Christ's active obedience unto the whole law, and passive obedience in his sufferings and death, for their whole and sole righteousness, they re∣ceiving and resting on him and his righteousness by faith; which faith they have not of themselves, it is the gift of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. Faith thus receiving and resting on Christ and his righteousness, is the alone instrument of justification; yet it is not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompa∣nied with all other saving graces, and is no dead faith, but worketh by love.</P>
<P N="3">3. Christ by his obedience and death did fully dis∣charge the debt of all those that are justified, and did by the sacrifice of himself, in the blood of his cross, undergo∣ing in their stead the penalty due unto them, make a pro∣per, real and full satisfaction to God's justice in their be∣half: Yet inasmuch as he was given by the Father for them, and his obedience and satisfaction accepted in their stead, and both freely, not for any thing in them, their justification is only of free grace, that both the exact justice and rich grace of God might be glorified in the justifica∣tion of sinners.</P>
<P N="4">4. God did from all eternity decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did in the fullness of time die for their sins and rise again for their justification: Nevertheless, they are not justified personally, until the holy Spirit doth in due time actually apply Christ unto them.</P>
<P N="5">5. God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified; and although they can never fall from the state of justification, yet they may by their sins fall under God's fatherly displeasure: And in that condition they

have not usually the light of his countenance restord unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. Of Sanctification.</HEAD>
<P>THEY that are effectually called and regenerated, be∣ing united to Christ, having a new heart and a new spirit created in them, through the virtue of Christ's death and resurrection, are also further sanctified really and personally through the same virtue, by his word and spirit dwelling in them, the dominion of the whole body of sin is destroyed, and the several lusts thereof are more and more weakned &amp; mortified, and they more and more quickned, and strengthened in all saving graces, to the practice of all holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. This sanctification is throughout in the whole man, yet imperfect in this life, there abide still some remnants of

<P N="3">3. In which war, although the remaining corruption for a time may much prevail, yet through the continual sup∣ply of strength from the sanctifing spirit of Christ, the re∣generate part doth overcome, and so the saints grow in grace, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP, XIV. Of saving Faith.</HEAD>
<P>THE grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe to the saving of their souls, is the work of the Spirit of Christ in their hearts, and is ordina∣rily wrought by the ministry of the word; by which also, and by the administration of the seals, prayer, and other means, it is increased and strengthened.</P>
<P N="2">2. By this faith a christian believeth to be true what∣soever is ravealed in the word, for the authority of God himself speaking therein, and acteth differently upon that which each particular passage thereof containeth, yielding obedience to the commands, trembling at the threatnings, and embracing the promises of God for this life, and that which is to come. But the principal acts of saving faith are accepting, receiving, and resting upon Christ alone, for justification, sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the covenant of grace.</P>
<P N="3">3. This faith, although it be different in degrees, and may be weak or strong, yet it is in the least degree of it different in the kind or nature of it (as is all other sa∣ving grace) from the faith and common grace of tempo∣rary believers; and therefore, though it may be many times assailed and weakned, yet it gets the victory, growing up in many to the attainment of a full assurance through Christ, who is both the author and finisher of our faith.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Of Repentance unto Life and Salvation.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH of the elect as are converted at riper years, hav∣ing sometime lived in the state of nature, and there∣in served divers lusts and pleasures, God in their ef∣fectual calling giveth them repentance unto life.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whereas there is none that doth good, and sinneth not, and the best of men may through the power and de∣ceitfulness of their corruptions dwelling in them, with the prevalency of temptation, fall into great sins and provoca∣tions; God hath in the covenant of grace mercifully pro∣vided that believers so sinning and falling, be renewed through repentance unto salvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. This saving repentance is an evangelical grace, whereby a person being by the holy Ghost made sensible of the manifold evils of his sin, doth by faith in Christ humble himself for it with godly sorrow, detestation of it, and self-abhorrency, praying for pardon and strength of grace, with a purpose and endeavor by supplies of the Spirit, to walk before God unto all well-pleasing in all things.</P>
<P N="4">4. As repentance is to be continued through the whole course of our lives, upon the account of the body of death, and the motions thereof; so it is every man's duty to re∣pent of his particular known sins, particularly.</P>
<P N="5">5. Such is the provision which God hath made thro' Christ in the covenant of grace, for the preservation of be∣lievers unto salvation, that although there is no sin so small, but it deserves damnation, yet there is no sin so great, that it shall bring damnation on them who truly re∣pent; which makes the constant preaching of repentance necessary.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. Of good Works.</HEAD>
<P>GOOD works are only such as God hath command∣ed in his holy word, and not such as without the warrant thereof are devised by men out of blind zeal, or upon any pretence of good intentions.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="255" REF="012626_0252_0F8B935B4F87C4E0"/>2. These good works done in obedience to God's commandments, are the fruits and evidences of a true and living faith, and by them believers manifest their thank∣fulness, strengthen their assurance, edify their brethren, a∣dorn the profession of the gospel, stop the mouths of the adversaries, and glorify God, whose workmanship they are, created in Christ Jesus thereunto, that having their fruit unto holiness, they may have the end eternal life.</P>
<P N="3">3. Their ability to do good works is not at all of themselves, but wholly from the Spirit of Christ: And that they may be enabled thereunto, besides the graces they have already received, there is required an actual in∣fluence of the same holy Spirit to work in them to will and to do, of his good pleasure; yet are they not hereupon to grow negligent, as if they were not bound to perform any duty, unless upon a special motion of the Spirit, but they ought to be diligent in stirring up the grace of God that is in them.</P>
<P N="4">4. They who in their obedience attain to the greatest height which is possible in this life, are so far from being able to supererogate, and to do more than God requires, as that they fall short of much, which in duty they are bound to do.</P>
<P N="5">5. We cannot by our best works merit pardon of sin, or eternal life at the hand of God, by reason of the great disproportion that is between them, and the glory to come; and the infinite distance that is between us, and God, whom by them we can neither profit, nor satisfy for the debt of our former sins; but when we have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are unprofitable servants: And because as they are good, they proceed from his Spirit, and as they are wrought by us, they are defiled and mixed with so much weakness and imperfecti∣on, that they cannot endure the severity of God's judge∣ment.</P>
<P N="6">6. Yet notwithstanding, the persons of believers being accepted through Christ, their good works also are accept∣ed in him, not as though they were in this life wholly un∣blameable and unreproveable in God's sight, but that he looking upon them in his Son is pleased to accept and re∣ward that which is sincere, although accompanied with many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tnesses and imperfections.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="256" REF="012626_0253_0F8B935C0DDC10B0"/>7. Works done by unregenerate men, although for the matter of them, they may be things which God commands, and of good use both to themselves and others; yet be∣cause they proceed not from an heart purified by faith, nor are done in a right manner, according to the word, nor to a right end, the glory of God; they are therefore sinful, and cannot please God, nor make a man meet to receive grace from God; and yet their neglect of them is more sinful and displeasing to God.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Of the Perseverance of the Saints.</HEAD>
<P>THEY whom God hath accepted in his beloved, ef∣fectually called and sanctified by his Spirit, can neither totally nor finally fall away from the state of grace, but shall certainly persevere therein to the end, and be eternally saved.</P>
<P N="2">2. This perseverance of the saints depends not upon their own free-will, but upon the immutability of the de∣cree of election, from the free and unchangeable love of God the Father, upon the efficacy of the merit and inter∣cession of Jesus Christ, and union with him, the oath of God, the abiding of his Spirit, and the seed of God within them, and the nature of the covenant of grace, from all which ariseth also the certainty and infallibility thereof.</P>
<P N="3">3. And though they may through the temptation of Satan, and of the world, the prevalency of corruption re∣maining in them, and the neglect of the means of their preservation, fall into grievous sins, and for a time con∣tinue therein, whereby they incur God's displeasure, and grieve his holy Spirit, come to have their graces and com∣forts impaired, have their hearts hardened, and their con∣sciences wounded, hurt and scandalize others, and bring temporal judgments upon themselves; yet they are and shall be kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. Of the Assurance of Grace and Salvation.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH temporary believers, and other unre∣generate men may vainly deceive themselves with false hopes and carnal presumptions of being in the favor of God, and state of salvation, which hope of theirs shall perish, yet such as truly believe on the Lord Jesus, and love him in sincerity, endeavoring to walk in all good conscience before him, may in this life be cer∣tainly assured that they are in a state of grace, and may rejoice in the hope of the glory of God, which hope shall never make them ashamed.</P>
<P N="2">2. This certainty is not a bare conjectural and proba∣ble perswasion, grounded upon a fallible hope, but an in∣fallible assurance of faith, founded on the blood and righ∣teousness of Christ, revealed in the gospel, and also upon the inward evidence of those graces, unto which promises are made, and on the immediate witness of the Spirit, testifying our adoption, and as a fruit thereof, leaving the heart more humble and holy.</P>
<P N="3">3. This infallible assurance doth not so belong to the essence of faith, but that a true believer may wait long, and conflict with many difficulties before he be partaker of it; yet being enabled by the Spirit to know the things which are freely given him of God, he may without extraordi∣nary revelation, in the right use of ordinary means attain thereunto: And therefore it is the duty of every one to give all diligence to make his calling and election sure, that thereby his heart may be enlarged in peace and joy in the holy Ghost, in love and thankfulness to God, and in strength and chearfulness in the duties of obedience, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> proper fruits of this assurance; so far is it from inclining men to looseness.</P>
<P N="4">4. True believers may have the assurance of their sal∣vation divers ways shaken, diminished and intermitted, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by negligence in preserving of it, by falling into some special sin, which woundeth the conscience, and grieveth the spirit, by some sudden or vehement temptation, by
<PB N="258" REF="012626_0255_0F8B935D8C6510B0"/>
God's withdrawing the light of his countenance, suffering even such as fear him to walk in darkness, and to have no light, yet are they neither utterly destitute of that seed of God, and life of faith, that love of Christ and the bre∣thren, that sincerity of heart and conscience of duty, out of which by the operation of the Spirit, this assurance may in due time be revived, and by the which in the mean time they are supported from utter despair.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="19" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. Of the Law of God.</HEAD>
<P>GOD gave to <HI>Adam</HI> a law of universal obedi∣ence written in his heart, and a particular precept of not eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, as a covenant of works, by which he bound him and all his posterity to personal, en∣tire, exact and perpetual obedience, promising life upon the fulfilling, and threatened death upon the breach of it, and endued him with power and ability to keep it.</P>
<P N="2">2. This law so written in the heart, continued to be a perfect rule of righteousness after the fall of man, and was delivered by God on mount <HI>Sinai</HI> in ten command∣ments, and written in two tables, the first four command∣ments containing our duty towards God, and the other six our duty to man.</P>
<P N="3">3. Beside this law commonly called moral, God was pleased to give the people of Israel, as a church under age, ceremonial laws, containing several typical ordinances, partly of worship, prefiguring Christ, his graces, actions, sufferings and benefits, and partly holding forth diver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in∣structions of moral duties: All which ceremonial laws be∣ing appointed only to the time of reformation, are by Je∣sus Christ the true Messiah and only law-giver, who was furnished with power from the Father for that end, abro∣gated and taken away.</P>
<P N="4">4. To them also he gave sundry judi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial laws, which expired together with the state of that people, not obliging any now by virtue of that institution, their general equity only being still of moral use.</P>
<P N="5">5. The moral law doth for ever bind all, as well justi∣fied persons as others, to the obedience thereof; and that
<PB N="259" REF="012626_0256_0F8B935E42CAC860"/>
not only in regard of the matter contained in it, but also in respect of the authority of God the creator, who gave it: Neither doth Christ in the gospel any way dissolve, but much strengthen this obligation.</P>
<P N="6">6. Although true believers be not under the law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a covenant of works, to be thereby justified or condemned, yet it is of great use to them as well as to others, in that, as a rule of life, informing them of the will of God, and their duty, and directs and binds them to walk according∣ly, discovering also the sinful pollutions of their nature, hearts and lives, so as examining themselves thereby, they may come to further conviction of, humiliation for, and hatred against sin, together with a clearer sight of the need they have of Christ, and the perfection of his obedience. It is likewise of use to the regenerate, to restrain their cor∣ruption<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, in that it forbids s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and the threatnings of it serve to shew what even their sins deserve, and what afflic∣tions in this life they may expect for them, although freed from the curse thereof threatened in the law. The pro∣mises of it in like manner shew them God's approbation of obedience, and what blessings they may expect upon the performance thereof, altho' not as due to them by the law, as a covenant of works; so as a mans doing good, and refraining from evil, because the law encourageth to the one, and deterreth from the other, is no evidence of his being under the law, and not under grace.</P>
<P N="7">7. Neither are the fore-mentioned uses of the law con∣trary to the grace of the gospel, but do sweetly comply with it, the Spirit of Christ subduing and enabling the will of man to do that freely and chearfully which the will of God revealed in the law required to be done.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. Of the Gospel, and of the extent of the Grace thereof.</HEAD>
<P>THE covenant of works being broken by sin, and made unprofitable unto life, God was pleased to give unto the elect the promise of Christ, the seed of the woman, as the means of calling them, and begetting in them faith and repentance: In this promise, the gospel, as to the substance of it, was revealed, and was therein effectual for the conversion and salvation of sinners.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="260" REF="012626_0257_0F8B935F1123D140"/>2. This promise of Christ, and salvation by him, is revealed only in and by the word of God; neither do the works of creation or providence, with the light of nature, make discovery of Christ, or of grace by him, so much as in a general or obscure way; much less that men destitute of the revelation of him by the promise or gos∣pel, should be enabled thereby to attain saving faith or re∣pentance.</P>
<P N="3">3. The revelation of the gospel unto sinners made in divers times, and by sundry parts, with the addition of promises and precepts for the obedience required therein, as to the nations and persons to whom it is granted, is meerly of the sovereign will and good pleasure of God, not being annexed by virtue of any promise to the due im∣provement of men's natural abilities, by virtue of com∣mon light received without it, which none ever did make, or can so do: And therefore in all ages the preaching of the gospel hath been granted unto persons and nations, as to the extent or straitning of it, in great variety, accord∣ing to the counsel of the will of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Although the gospel be the only outward means of revealing Christ and saving grace, and is, as such, abun∣dantly suffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ient thereunto; yet that men who are dead in trespasses, may be born again, quickened or regenerated, there is moreover necessary an effectual, irresistible work of the holy Ghost upon the whole soul, for the producing in them a new spiritual life, wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hout which no other means are sufficient for their conversion unto God.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXI. Of Christian Liberty, and Liberty of Conscience.</HEAD>
<P>THE liberty which Christ hath purchased for belie∣vers under the gospel, consists in their freedom from the gilt of sin, the condemning wrath of God, the rigor and cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of the law, and in their being deli∣vered from this present evil world, bondage to Satan, and dominion of sin, from the evil of afflictions, the fear and sting of death, the victory of the grave, and everlasting damnation, as also in their free ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess to God, and their yielding od<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dience unto him, not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avish fear, but

a child-like love and willing mind: All which were com∣mon also to believers under the law, for the substance of them, but under the new testament, the liberty of chris∣tians is further enlarged in their freedom from the yoke of the ceremonial law, the whole legal administration of the covenant of grace to which the Jewish church was subjected, and in greater boldness of access to the throne of grace, and in fuller communications of the free Spirit of God, than believers under the law did ordinarily par∣take of.</P>
<P N="2">2. God alone is Lord of the conscience, and hath left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men, which are in any thing contrary to his word, or not con∣tained in it; so that to believe such doctrines, or to obey such commands out of consci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, is to betray true liberty of conscience, and the requiring of an implicit faith, and an absolute and blind obedience, is to destroy liberty of conscience, and reason also.</P>
<P N="3">3. They who upon pretence of christian liberty do practise any sin, or cherish any lust, as they do thereby pervert the main design of the grace of the gospel to their own destruction, so they wholly destroy the end of chris∣tian liberty, which is, that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might serve the Lord without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. Of Religious Worship, and of the Sabbath-Day.</HEAD>
<P>THE light of nature sheweth that there is a God, who hath a lordship and sovereignty over all, is just, good, and doth good unto all, and is therefore to be feared, loved, praised, called upon, trusted in, and ser∣ved with all the heart, and all the soul, and with all the might: But the acceptable way of worshipping the true God, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> instituted by himself, and so limited by his own revealed will, that he may not be worshipped accord∣ing to the imaginations and devices of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or the suggesti∣ons of satan, under any visible representation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or any other way not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="262" REF="012626_0259_0F8B93607A27F850"/>2. Religious worship is to God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, and to him alone; not to angels, saints, or any other creatures; and since the fall, not without a medi∣ator, nor in the mediation of any other but of Christ alone.</P>
<P N="3">3. Prayer with thanksgiving, being one special part of natural worship, is by God required of all men; but that it may be accepted, it is to be made in the name of the Son, by the help of his Spirit, according to his will, with understanding, reverence, humility, fervency, faith, love, &amp; perseverence: And when with others in a known tongue.</P>
<P N="4">4. Prayer is to be made for things lawful, and for all sorts of men living, or that shall live hereafter, but not for the dead, nor for those of whom it may be known that they have sinned the sin unto death.</P>
<P N="5">5. The reading of the scriptures, preaching &amp; hearing of the word of God, singing of psalms, as also the ad∣minstration of baptism and the Lords supper, are all parts of religious worship of God, to be performed in obedience unto God, with understanding, faith, reverence and godly fear. Solemn humilations with fastings, and thanksgiving upon special occasions, are in their several times and sea∣sons to be used in an holy and religious manner.</P>
<P N="6">6. Neither prayer, nor any other part of religious worship, is now under the gospel either tied unto, or made more acceptable by any place in which it is preformed, or towards which it is directed: But God is to be worship∣ped every where in spirit and in truth, as in private fa∣milies daily, and in secret each one by himself, so more so∣lemnly in the public assemblies, which are not carelesly nor willfully to be neglected, or forsaken, when God by word or providence calleth thereunto.</P>
<P N="7">7. As it is of the law of nature, that in general a pro∣portion of time by Gods appointment be set apart for the worship of God; so by his word in a positive, moral and perpetual commandment, binding all men in all ages, he hath particularly appointed one day in seven for a sabbath to be kept holy unto him, which from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of Christ, was the last day of the week, and from the resurrection of Christ, was chan∣ged into the first day of the week, which in scripture is called the Lord's day, and is to be continued to the end of the world as the christian sabbath, the observation of the last day of the week being abolished.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="263" REF="012626_0260_0F8B93614AD3A310"/>8. This sabbath is then kept holy unto the Lord, when men after a due preparing of their hearts, and or∣dering their common affairs beforehand, do not only ob∣serve an holy rest all the day from their own works, words, and thoughts about their worldy employments and recrea∣tions, but also are taken up the whole time in the publick and private exercises of his worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="23" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. Of Lawful Oaths and Vows.</HEAD>
<P>A Lawful oath is a part of religious worship, where∣in the person swearing in truth, righteousness and judgment, solemnly calleth God to witness what he asserteth or promiseth, and to judge him according to the truth and falshood of what he sweareth.</P>
<P N="2">2. The name of God only is that by which men ought to swear, and therein it is to be used with all holy fear and reverence: Therefore to swear vainly or rashly by that glorious and dreadful name, or to swear at all by any other thing, is sinful, and to be abhorred: Yet as in mat∣ters of weight and moment an oath is warranted by the word of God, under the new testament, as well as under the old; so a lawful oath, being imposed by lawful autho∣rity in such matters, ought to be taken.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whosoever taketh an oath warranted by the word of God, ought duly to consider the weightiness of so solemn an act, and therein to avouch nothing but what he is fully perswaded is the truth: Neither may any man bind him∣self by oath to any thing, but what is good &amp; just, and what he believeth so to be, and what he is able and resolved to perform. Yet it is a sin to refuse an oath touching any thing that is good and just, being lawfully imposed by authority.</P>
<P N="4">4. An oath is to be taken in the plain and common sense of the words, without equivocation, or mental reservati∣on: It cannot oblige to sin, but in any thing not sinful be∣ing taken, it binds to performance, although to a mans own hurt; nor is it to be violated, although made to Hereticks or Infidels.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="264" REF="012626_0261_0F8B9362097B0850"/>5. A vow, which is not to be made to any creature, but God alone, is of the like nature with a promissory oath, and ought to be made with the like religious care, and to performed with the like faithfulness.</P>
<P N="6">6. Popish monastical vows of perpetual single life, professed poverty, and regular obedience, are so far from being degrees of higher perfection, that they are supersti∣tious and sinful snares, in which no christian may intangle himself.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="24" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. Of the Civil Magistrate.</HEAD>
<P>GOD the supream Lord and king of all the world, hath ordained civil magistrates to be under him, o∣ver the people for his own glory &amp; the public good; and to this end hath armed them with the power of his sword, for the defence and encouragement of them that do good, and for the punishment of evil doers.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is lawful for christians to accept and execute the office of a magistrate, when called thereunto: In the man∣agement whereof, as they ought especially to maintain piety, justice and peace, according to the wholsome laws of each commonwealth, so for that end they may lawfully now under the new testament wage war upon just and necessa∣ry occasions.</P>
<P N="3">3. They who upon pretence of christian liberty shall oppose any lawful power, or the lawful exercises of it, re∣sist the ordinance of God, and for their publishing of such opinions, or maintaining of such practices as are contrary to the light of nature, or to the known principles of chris∣tianity, whether concerning faith, worship or conversation, or to the power of godliness, or such erroneous opinions or practices, as either in their own nature, or in the man∣ner of publishing or maintaining them, are destructive to the external peace and order which Christ hath established in the church, they may lawfully be called to account, and proceeded against by the censures of the church, and by the power of the civil magistrate; yet in such differ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nces about the doctrines of the gospel, or ways of the worship of God
<PB N="265" REF="012626_0262_0F8B9362C4ACABA8"/>
as may befal men exercising a good conscience, manifest∣ing it in their conversation, and holding the foundation, and duly observing the rules of peace and order, there is no warrant for the magistrate to abrige them of their liberty.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is the duty of people to pray for magistrates, to honor their persons, to pay them tribute and other dues, to obey their lawful commands, and to be subject to their authority for conscience sake. Infidelity, or difference in religion doth not make void the magistrates just and legal authority, nor free the people from their due obedience to him: From which ecclesiastical persons are not exempted, much less hath the Pope any power or jurisdiction over them in their dominions, or over any of their people, and least of all to deprive them of their dominions or lives, if he shall judge them to be hereticks, or upon any orher pre∣tence whatsoever.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXV. Of Marriage.</HEAD>
<P>MARRIAGE is to be between one man and one wo∣man; neither is it lawful for any man to have more than one wife, nor for any woman to have more than one husband at the same time.</P>
<P N="2">2. Marriage was ordained for the mutual help of hus∣band and wife, for the increase of mankind with a legiti∣mate issue, and of the church with an holy seed, and for preventing of uncleanness.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is lawful for all sorts of people to marry, who are able with judgment to give their consent. Yet it is the duty of christians to marry in the Lord, and therefore such as profess the true reformed religion, should not mar∣ry with infidels, papists, or other idolaters: Neither should such as are godly be unequally yoked by marrying such as are wicked in their life, or maintain damnable heresey.</P>
<P N="4">4. Marriage ought not to be within the degrees of consanguinity or affinity forbidden in the word, nor can such incestuous marriages ever be made lawful by any law of man, or consent of parties, so as those persons may live together as man and wife.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVI. Of the Church.</HEAD>
<P>THE catholick or universal church, which is invisible, consists of the whole number of the elect, that have been, are, or shall be gathered into one under Christ the head thereof, and is the spouse, the body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</P>
<P N="2">2. The whole body of men throughout the world, professing the faith of the gospel, and obedience unto God by Christ according unto it, not destroying their own profession by any errors everting the foundation, or unholiness of conver∣sation, they and their children with them are, &amp; may be called the visible catholick church of Christ, although as such it is not intrusted with any officers to rule or govern over the whole body.</P>
<P N="3">3. The purest churches under heaven are subject both to mixture and error, and some have so degenerated as to become no churches of Christ, but synagogues of Satan; ne∣vertheless Christ always hath had, and ever shall have a visible kingdom in this world, to the end thereof, of such as believe in him, and make profession of his name.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is no other head of the church but the Lord Jesus Christ, nor can the Pope of Rome in any sense be head thereof, but is that anti-christ, that man of sin, and son of perdition, that exalteth himself in the church against Christ, and all that is called God, whom the Lord shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.</P>
<P N="5">5. As the Lord in his care and love towards his church hath in his infinite wise providence, exercised it with great variety in all ages for the good of them that love him, and his own glory; so according to his promise, we expect that in the latter days, anti-christ being destroyed, the <HI>Jews</HI> called, and the adversaries of the kingdom of his dear Son broken, the churches of Christ being enlarged and edified, through a free and plentiful communication of light and grace, all enjoy in this world a more quiet, peaceable and glorious condition than they have enjoyed.</P>

<P>ALL saints that are united to Jesus Christ their head by his Spirit and faith, although they are not made thereby one person with him, have fellowship in his graces, sufferings, death, resurrection and glory: And being united to one another in love, they have communion in each others gifts and graces, and are obliged to the performance of such duties, public and private, as do con∣duce to their mutual good, both in the inward and out∣ward man.</P>
<P N="2">2. All saints are bound to maintain an holy fellow∣ship and communion in the worship of God, and in per∣forming such other spiritual services as tend to their mu∣tual edification, as also in relieving each other in out∣ward things, according to their several abilities and ne∣cessities: which communion, though especially to be ex∣ercised by them in the relations wherein they stand, whe∣ther in families or in churches, yet as God offereth op∣portunity, is to be extended unto all those who in every place call upon the name of the Lord Jesus.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVIII. Of the Sacraments.</HEAD>
<P>SACRAMENTS are holy signs and seals of the co∣venant of grace, immediately instituted by Christ, to represent him and his benefits, and to confirm our interest in him, and solemnly to engage us to the service of God in Christ, according to his word.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is in every sacrament a spiritual relation, or sacramental union between the sign and the thing sig∣nified; whence it comes to pass, that the names and ef∣fects of the one are attributed to the other.</P>
<P N="3">3. The grace which is exhibited in or by the sacra∣ments rightly used, is not conferred by any power in them, neither doth the efficacy of a sacrament depend upon the piety or intention of him that doth administer it; but upon the work of the Spirit, and the word of institution, which contains together with a precept authorizing the use thereof, a promise of benefit to worthy receivers.</P>
<P N="4">4. There be only two sacraments ordained by Christ

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIX. Of Baptism.</HEAD>
<P>BAPTISM is a sacrament of the new testament, or∣dained by Jesus Christ, to be unto the party baptized a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, of his ingraff∣ing into Christ, of regeneration, of remission of sins, and of his giving up unto God through Jesus Christ, to walk in newness of life; which ordinance is by Christ's own appointment to be continued in his church, until the end of the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. The outward element to be used in this ordinance is water, wherewith the party is to be baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost, by a minister of the gospel lawfully called thereunto.</P>
<P N="3">3. Dipping of the person into the water is not neces∣sary, but baptism is rightly administered by pouring or sprinkling water upon the person.</P>
<P N="4">4. Not only those that do actually profess faith in &amp; o∣bedience unto Christ, but also the infants of one or both believing parents are to be baptised, and those only.</P>
<P N="5">5. Although it be a great sin to contemn or neglect this ordinance, yet grace and salvation are not so insepa∣rably annexed to it, as that no person can be regenerated or saved without it; or that all that are baptized are un∣doubtedly regenerated.</P>
<P N="6">6. The efficacy of baptism is not tied to that mo∣ment of time wherein it is administered, yet not withstand∣ing, by the right use of this ordinance, the grace promised is not only offered, but really exhibited and conferred by the holy Ghost to such (whether of age or infants) as that grace belongeth unto, according to the counsel of God's own will in his appointed time.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP.XXX. Of the Lord's Supper.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Lord Jesus in the night wherein he was betray∣ed, instituted the sacrament of his body and blood, called the Lord's supper, to be observed in his chur∣ches to the end of the world, for the perpetual remem∣brance, and shewing forth of the sacrifice of himself in his death, the sealing of all benefits thereof unto true be∣lievers, their spiritual nourishment and growth in him, their further engagement in and to all duties which they owe unto him, and to be a bond and pledge of their com∣munion with him, and with each other.</P>
<P N="2">2. In this sacrament Christ is not offered up to his Father, nor any real sacrifice made at all for remission of sin of the quick or dead, but only a memorial of that one offering up of himself upon the cross once for all, and a spiritual oblation of all possible praise unto God for the same; so that the popish sacrifice of the mass (as they call it) is most abominable injurious to Christ's own only sacrifice, the alone propitiation for all the sins of the elect.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Lord Jesus hath in this ordinance appointed his ministers to declare his word of institution to the peo∣ple, to pray and bless the elements of bread and wine, and thereby to set them apart from a common to an holy use, and to take and brake the bread, to take the cup, and (they communicating also themselves) to give both to the communicants, but to none who are not then present in the congregation.</P>
<P N="4">4. Private masses, or receiving the sacrament by a priest, or any other alone, as likewise the denial of the cup to the people, worshipping the elements, the lifting them up, or carrying them about for adoration, and the re∣serving them for any pretended religious use, are all con∣trary to the nature of this sacrament, and to the institution of Christ.</P>
<P N="5">5. The outward elements in this sacrament duly set apart for the uses ordained by Christ, have such relation to him crucified, as that truly, yet sacramentally only, they are sometimes called by the name of the things they represent, to wit, the body and blood of Christ; albeit in substance and nature they still remain truly and only bread and wine as they were before.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="270" REF="012626_0267_0F8B936C6B4729A0"/>6. That doctrine which maintains a change of the substance of bread and wine, into the substance of Christ's body and blood (commonly called transubstantiation) by consecration of a priest, or any other way, is repugnant not to the scripture alone, but even to common sense and rea∣son, overthroweth the nature of the sacrament, and hath been, and is the cause of manifold superstitions, yea, of gross idolatries.</P>
<P N="7">7. Worthy receivers outwardly partaking of the vi∣sible elements in this sacrament, do then also inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritully, receive and feed upon Christ crucified, and all benefits of his death; the body &amp; blood of Christ being then not corporally or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nally in with, or under the bread and wine, yet as really, but spiritually present to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to their outward senses.</P>
<P N="8">8. All ignorant and ungodly persons as they are un∣fit to enjoy communion with Christ, so are they unworthy of the Lord's table, and cannot without great sin against him, whilst they remain such, partake of these holy mys∣teries, or be admitted thereunto; yea, whosoever shall receive unworthily, are guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, eating and drinking judgment to themselves.</P>
