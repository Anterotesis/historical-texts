<HEAD>Divine righteousness in the Salvation, <HI>AND</HI> Damnation of Sinners exhibited.</HEAD>
<P>MR. ROBBINS, has taken for his text Rom. ix. 18. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. And pursuant to his design, to vindicate the Divine Sovereignty in the Salvation and damnation of Sinners, he 1st proposes,
<Q>To investigate the meaning of GOD's having mercy on whom he will have mercy. 2. The meaning of the counter-part to this, and whom he will he hardeneth. 3. Evince, and illustrate this great truth, that it be∣longs to GOD—is his essential prerogative, to have mer∣cy on whom he will have mercy, and to harden whom he will harden. Then, 4. Answer objections. And, 5. Improve the subject, by deduction, and application.</Q></P>
<P>Under the first head, Mr. Robbins considers the latitude in which the word mercy, when applied to GOD, is some∣times used in the Bible. And in page, 9, comes to this conclusion,
<Q>In the text, particular reference is had to saving mercy.</Q>
He explains himself more fully in page, 13,
<Q>They on whom he hath mercy are regenerated, are united to Christ, are justified, and shall be saved: See∣ing, as hath been observed, there is a particular refer∣ence, not to common and promiscuous; but to special and saving mercy. Consequently, by the hardened we are to understand these who are, or shall be left in an impenitent unbelieving state to the last—to their eternal ruin and destruction.</Q>
In page, 38, he says,
<Q>Re∣pentance is implied in GOD's having mercy on any, in the sense of the text; and impenitence continued to the last is implied in his hardening whom he will.</Q>
In page,
<PB N="4" REF="026990_0003_0FD2B465A4894580"/>
39, he says,
<Q>It belongs to GOD—is his essential prero∣gative to determine the character, and dispose of the eternal state of men; in holiness and salvation, or in sin and damnation, according to his own good pleasure.</Q>
From these quotations, and others of like import that might be made, it is p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain to me, that when Mr. Rob∣bins says,
<Q>In the text, particular reference is had to sa∣ving mercy.</Q>
He means such mercy as is inseparably connected with eternal life. And by hardened, to use his own words,
<Q>We are to understand those who are, or shall be left in an impenitent unbelieving state to the last, to their eternal ruin and destruction.</Q>
While those on whom he hath mercy, to use his own words,
<Q>Are regenerated, are united to Christ, are justified, and shall be saved.</Q>
That the meaning of the text, accor∣ding to Mr. Robbins, is plainly this, I will have mercy, i. e. save eternally whom I will, and harden, i. e. damn eternally whom I will. His own words are,
<Q>It be∣longs to GOD—is his essential prerogative, to determine the character, and dispose of the eternal state of men, in holiness and salvation, or in sin and damnation, accor∣ding to his own good pleasure.</Q></P>
<P>Wherefore, if Mr. Robbins is right, the election and reprobation the Apostle is arguing about in this chapter, is election by an absolute decree and purpose of GOD to eternal life, with respect to some men: and reprobation by a like absolute decree to eternal misery, with respect to others. But, that this is not the meaning of the Apostle, in the 9th Chapter to the Romans; is what he had no thought of, as it lay quite wide of his design, through this whole Chapter, I think I can easily demonstrate. But as the sovereignty of GOD, is one thing which Mr. Robbins designs, very specially to show by his discourse. I shall therefore, reply to him in the method following, viz.</P>

</LIST>
<P>First, I am to show what we are to believe concern∣ing the sovereignty of GOD. Now it is very evident, both from reason and scripture; that Almighty GOD, as the creator and governor of mankind, sustains a double character; as sovereign benefactor and righteous judge. As creator and sovereign benefactor, GOD has a right to be, and actually is partial in the distribution of his grace. But as governor and judge, he is and ever will be impar∣tial in the distribution of justice. The doctrine of partial grace is held up to view, in Matthew xx. 15. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? And Chap. xxv, 34, 15. For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods: And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability. These scriptures hold forth a partial election, and a par∣tial reprobation; both flowing from a free, wise, and sovereign grace, which is notoriously respective of per∣sons.</P>
<P>By this partial election and reprobation of free grace, I mean, the choice which GOD, as a sovereign benefac∣tor, makes or refuses to make of some persons, church∣es, cities and nations, to bestow or withhold favours from them. It is the partiality, with which he imparts his talents, of nature, providence and grace to his creatures; giving five talents to some, two to others, and but one to others. This partiality of GOD, discovered in dispen∣sing his favours to his creatures, is doubtless in perfect wisdom: but by no rules or methods of proceeding that we are acquainted with. The time when we shall exist, the country where we shall live, our parents, our consti∣tution of body and turn of mind; these and numberless
<PB N="6" REF="026990_0005_0FD2B468B167B868"/>
other circumstances are doubtless ordered wisely; but by rules that lay quite out of our sight. Plain it is, that, GOD is good and gracious to all men; but it is as plain that he is not equally gracious: For he gives to some persons, families, churches and nations, more power and opportunity to do and receive good, more means of grace, more excellent means, more time to use those means, and more energy of the spirit in the use of them, than he gives to other persons, famil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, churches and nations. And this great partiality in God, which appears in the bestowment of his favours, is in no degree caused by the works of the creatures; nay, so far from this, it, is it∣self the first cause of all natural excellencies and evangel∣ical worthiness.</P>
<P>Uncreated Adam, did nothing to merit that distin∣guishing election, which raised him above the first Ox: nor did the first Ox, do any thing to deserve to be repro∣bated from all knowledge of his maker, and everlasting∣ly shut out of the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P>The Lark, did nothing to merit her election to tow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring flight and sprightly songs; nor did the poor Oyster do any thing to deserve such a reprobation, to be shut up between two shells, without legs or wings. We may trace the footsteps of an electing or reprobating provi∣dence all the earth over; with respect to persons and places. We see one elected to sway a sceptre, another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bated to handle a spade. We see a rich glutton <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to a plentiful fortune, while poor Lazarus, a no∣torious reprobate of providence, lays starving at the door of me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess plenty. We see one elected to enjoy the blessing of the five senses, the advantage of a strong constitution, and the prerogative of beauty; whilst another is born blind or deaf, sickly or deformed; but the poor creature has done nothing to deserve such a re∣probation; nor the other to merit such election. But with such apparent partiality does the great Lord of all dispense, not only his providential blessings, but like∣wise his spiritual favours: as every one may see who takes a view of the scripture account of the covenants of pro∣mise, which GOD made at different times with savoured
<PB N="7" REF="026990_0006_0FD2B4ACC2065B38"/>
men, families, churches and nations: peculiar cove∣nants which flowed every one from a peculiar election of grace; by which we may see the election and reprobation of partial grace most clearly. But GOD Almighty has a throne of justice, as well as a throne of grace.</P>
<P>The doctrine of impartial justice, is held forth in such scriptures as these, Luke, ix. 26, I say unto you, that to every one who hath, more shall be given: and from him who hath not, even that he hath, shall be taken away from him. Rev. iii. 4, Thou hast a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are wor∣thy. Here is held forth an impartial election and an impartial reprobation; both flowing from divine justice; which is always irrespective of persons. The impartial election and reprobation of justice is the righteous choice, which GOD makes or refuses to make of some persons, churches, cities and nations, to reward them according to his promises, or punish them according to his threat∣nings.</P>
<P>St. Paul, has taught us, that GOD will render to every man according to his deeds; to them who by patient continuance in well doing—eternal life: but unto them that obey unrighteousness, indignation and wealth. Rom. ii. 6, 7, 8. The same doctrine is taught by the Prophet Isaiah, Chap. iii. 10, 11; Say ye to the righteous, it shall b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well with him; for they shall eat the frost of their doings. Wo to the wicked: it shall be ill with him; for the reward of his hands shall be given him. The same we have in Ezek. xviii. 30; Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD: Repent, and turn your∣selves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. But this doctrine is taught by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne more clearly, than by our Lord Jesus, in his last charge, Rev. xxii. 12; Behold I come quickly; and my reward is with one, to give every man according as his works shall be. The election of justice is then nothing but the im∣partiality, with which GOD makes choice of his good and faithful servants, rather than his wicked and slothful
<PB N="8" REF="026990_0007_0FD2B46A07D2DA78"/>
servants, to bestow upon them the temporal and eternal reward of goodness and faithfulness, according to their works; when he cometh and reckoneth with them, about the talents which his free grace bestowed upon them. Nor is the reprobation of justice any thing, but the im∣partiality with which GOD as a righteous judge and dis∣pensor of his punishments, reprobates from his rewards of grace and glory, his wicked and unfaithful servants, who do not use, or who vilely abuse the talents, which his free grace entrusted them with.</P>
<P>The full <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide of scripture evidently flows in these two channels; an election of partial grace, according to which GOD grants or denies original favours as a sover∣eign benefactor; and an election of impartial justice, ac∣cording to which he bestows rewards and inflicts pun∣ishments as a supreme judge. And as from the uncon∣ditional, personal, partial election of grace, there fol∣lows a harmless, unconditional, personal reprobation; as in the case of Jacob and Esau, for while Jacob and the Israelites were peculiarly loved, Esau and the Edo∣mites were comparatively hated, i. e. while the Israelites were greatly favoured, the Edomites were less favoured. So likewise from the conditional impartial election of justice; there follows an impartial reprobation; for when the righteous are rewarded the wicked shall be punished; when the judge shall say to those that have done well, come ye blessed, he will say to those that have done ill, depart ye cursed.</P>
<P>Thus although GOD dispenses his favours as benefac∣tor and Lord with a partial hand, by rules that lay quite out of our fight; and according to the inscrutable counsel of his own will: yet his method of dealing with us as lawgiver, governor and judge, is perfectly known, being clearly revealed in the word, namely, that he will render to every man according to his works.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If any would wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to see this subject more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, they may find it excellently well done in the ingenious Mr. Fletcher's works, Vol. 3. p. 250.</NOTE> Now, keeping in view the sovereign partiality; which the great Lord of all has right to, and actually does exercise in
<PB N="9" REF="026990_0008_0FD2B4B2068528B0"/>
dispensing, primiary and original favours: and the righteous impartiality and exact justice, with which he as law-giver and judge forever rewards and punishes; we will try by this key to open the ninth chapter in St. Pauls Epistle to the Romans, which was the second thing proposed to be done, and to which I now come. 2 To give a brief explanation, of the ix chap. to the Rom. It will doubtless be allowed that before the coming of Christ, the Church, or peculiar kingdom of GOD's grace, was confined to the Jewish nation; including only such heathen, as were incorporated among them by becoming Jews and observing the whole Law of Moses. And the Jews firmly believed it would always be so. Even the best men among them, Christ's own disciples not excep∣ted; appear to have no apprehension of an alteration in this respect. Accordingly when our Lord came, and revealed this mystery of God, which before was hid, both from Jews and Gentiles; namely, that the Gentiles should be called by the gospel, and freely admitted into the Church, under the Messiah, and upon the same terms that the Jews themselves were admitted; it was univer∣sally opposed by the Jews. And although GOD's owning the Gentiles; by pouring out the holy ghost upon them, in various miraculous gifts, did satisfy in good measure the christian Jews at Jerusalem, who were disgusted at Peter, for treating the first uncircumcised Gentile con∣verts, as members of the church of GOD, Acts, xi. 2, 3, And extorted from them this confession, namely, Thou hath GOD also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life, which they believed could not have been granted unto them, without obedience to the law of Moses. But the unbelieving Jews paid no regard to this, or any other argument in favour of the uncircumcised Gentiles.</P>
<P>The notion of admitting them into the church of GOD, only upon faith of Christ, they opposed and persecuted every where, with great zeal and bitterness. And it seems it was not long before good impressions wore off, and old prejudices revived, even among the believing Jews.</P>
<P>Numbers of them very stifly, and with much conten∣tion,
<PB N="10" REF="026990_0009_0FD2B46B9AC96FE8"/>
endeavoured to persuade the Gentile converts, that except they were circumcised after the manner of Moses, they could not be saved, i. e. admitted to the privileges of the kingdom of GOD, and the hope of eternal life, Acts, xv. 1, 2.</P>
<P>But had the Jewish notion prevailed, that no part of mankind could have any share in the blessings of GOD's most gracious covenant, the pardon of sin, and the hope of eternal life, but only such as were circumcised, and brought themselves under obligations to the law of Mo∣ses; the extensive scheme of the gospel would have been ruined, and the gracious design of freeing the church from the embarrassments of the law of Moses, would have been defeated.</P>
<P>The glad tidings of salvation by Christ, must, not on∣ly have been confined to the narrow limits of the Jewish peculiarity, and clogged with all the ceremonial obser∣vances belonging to it: but had the gospel been built upon the foundation of the Jewish polity, it must have been totally destroyed when that was demolished; and so the whole peculiar kingdom of GOD in the world would have been overthrown and extinct at the same time: and all the light it was calculated to diffuse throughout the world, would have been quite extinguished.</P>
<P>This was therefore a matter of the greatest importance to be clearly and fully determined and settled, namely, whether the Jewish pale should stand or not, or whether, the Gentile converts might be trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d as members of the church of GOD without becoming Jews, and observing circumcision and the law of Moses. And as St. Paul was commissioned to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, it became his duty, to prove, that we Gentiles are the children of GOD, interested in his covenant, and all the honours, blessings and privileges of his family and king∣dom here upon earth, only by faith in Christ, without coming under any obligations to the law of Moses, as such, which is the main drift and subject of this Epistle; which the Apostle begins, by showing, Jews and Gen∣tiles to be equally sinful and obnoxious to wrath; and therefore, there was no way for the Jews to be continued
<PB N="11" REF="026990_0010_0FD2B4B2B66C8A78"/>
in the kingdom of GOD, but by grace, through faith; and by grace and faith the Gentiles might be admitted into it. But as this would of course overthrow the Jew∣ish peculiarity; so likewise it would from hence follow, that all those Jews, who do not embrace the faith of the gospel, are cast out of the pale of the visible church, and the kingdom of GOD taken from them.</P>
<P>Now as nothing could be more disagreeable to the Jews than this doctrine; they accordingly levelled all their artillery against the Gentiles being called, or invited into the church or kingdom of GOD; and laboured every argument to unhinge the believing Gentiles, and per∣suade them, that they were not duly taken into the church. Therefore, to prove, that the Jews, by rejec∣ting Christ and the gospel, were themselves cast out of the church, consistantly with the truth of GOD's promise to Abraham, was a matter of the greatest moment, to convince and confound the unbelieving Jews, and estab∣lish the Gentile believers.</P>
<P>And this the Apostle sets himself, more especially to do in the ix chap. to the Rom. Which he begins by declaring that it was the truth, that compelled him to the execution of this part of his commission, as Apostle of the Gentiles; and not ill-will to his countrymen; in whose rejection, he was so far from taking pleasure, that it was a continual grief and sorrow to him; and the rath∣er so, he, having had an experimental acquaintance, with the prejudices they were under, with respect to Christ and the gospel, ver. 1, 2, 3. In the 4th and 5th ver. he re∣counts the honours and privileges, which his country∣men the Jews, as the church of GOD had long enjoyed. Then ver. 6, proceeds to answer an objection that might he made against the rejection of the Jews; notwithstan∣ding the infidelity of the greatest part of them, groun∣ded upon the promise of GOD to Abraham, Gen. xvii. 7, 8: I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, for an everlasting covenant; to be a GOD unto thee, and thy seed after thee.</P>
<P>Now if the Jews were reduced to a level with the na∣tions that lie out of the church, and excluded from the
<PB N="12" REF="026990_0011_0FD2B46D09703E98"/>
common-wealth, to which they once belonged, will it not follow; that GOD hath failed in the performance of his promise to Abraham? To this the Apostle answers ver. 6: That they are not all Israel which are of Israel, i. e. the Jews are not the whole of the Israel of GOD com∣prehended in the promise. For Abraham is the father of many nations; and his seed is, not only that which is of the law, but that also which is of the faith of Abra∣ham. Ver. 7, 8, 9, He observes they had no right to conclude, that, because they are the natural descends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of Abraham, therefore they are all of them, without ex∣ception, the children in whom the promise is to be ful∣filled. For the promise never was confined to natural descent, but may be accomplished in any part of Abra∣hams seed, as GOD in his sovereign pleasure shall see sit; as appears from the rejection of Ishmael and the election of Isaac.</P>
<P>And lest it should be said, that Ishmael was rejected not by the sovereign will of GOD, but because he was the son of the bond woman, and therefore unworthy to be the peculiar seed. Therefore the Apostle instances in another limitation of the seed of Abraham, namely, the twin children of Isaac by Rebecca, before they were born, or had done either good or evil, that the purpose of GOD according to election might stand; it was said, the elder shall serve the younger, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. In this case it cannot be said, that Esau was reprobated because profane and wicked, or Jacob loved because he was righteous, for they had not done either good to deserve, or evil to forfeit the divine favour: See ver. 10, 11, 12, 13.—This plainly demon∣strates; that the purpose and intention of GOD, accor∣ding to his own free choice, is the only rule and stan∣dard of bestowing priminary and original favours: on men and nations; not of works, but the good pleasure of GOD alone that called Jacob and the Jews to be his peculiar people, while Esau and his posterity were re∣probated, from the peculiar privileges of the church of GOD. And none may conclude, that GOD's bestowing religious privileges in such an unequal manner upon those,
<PB N="13" REF="026990_0012_0FD2B4B3CF3C92E0"/>
who otherwise are in equal circumstances, is contrary to equity and right; as the Apostle observes, ver. 14. For surely GOD may do what he will with his own.</P>
<P>GOD did no wrong to man, because he made Angels; no wrong to the mouse, because he made the elephant: no wrong to the herring because he made the whale, nor any wrong to Esau, because he gave his brother five talents, when he gave him but two.</P>
<P>Justice is not concerned in bestowing original favours; but GOD as sovereign Lord and benefactor, dispenses these, with the most notorious partiality, without any wrong or injustice to his creatures. Here let it be noti∣ced, that the instances alledged by the Apostle, wherein the great Lord of all had discovered his sovereignty, in the choice of persons to enjoy peculiar privileges, doth not respect the persons themselves so much as their poste∣rity. And it has no respect to the eternal state of either. This will appear plain to any one that looks into the texts in Gen. from whence they are quoted.</P>
<P>Of Ishmael 'tis said Gen. xvii. 20: Twelve Princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. So of Jacob and Esau, it was said to Rebecca, Gen. xxv. 23: Two nations are in thy womb, two manner of peo∣ple shall be seperated from thy bowels, the one people shall be stronger than the other people, and the elder shall serve the younger; which says the Apostle, was said that the purpose of GOD according to election might stand, ver. 11.12. So that this must be an election of people and not of particular persons, for it never was fact in the persons themselves. So likewise the next words, Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated, quo∣ted from Mal. 1, 2, 3, are manifestly to be understood of the nations that were to descend from these persons, and not the persons themselves.</P>
<P>For ought that appears Esau had as many talents as Jacob. The words of the text in Mal. are, I loved Ja∣cob and hated Esau, and laid his mountains and heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness; whereas Edom saith, we are impovershied, &amp;c. This is evidently spo∣ken of the people, and solely with regard to their condi∣tion
<PB N="14" REF="026990_0013_0FD2B46F56150F98"/>
in this world.—Let it be further noted here, that by GOD's ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g the posterity of Esau, we are not to under∣stand absolute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tred, for they had a good blessing; though not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good a one as the posterity of Jacob. Yet it is certain GOD loved them, and blessed them; and hatred is no more intended, than when our Lord says as in Luke xiv. 26: He that hateth not father and mother &amp;c. cannot be my disciple: where he cannot be under∣stood to mean hatred, unless he contradict himself—but means what is expressed, Mat. x. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7. He that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me. So GOD's hating Esau's posterity and loving Jacobs, means nothing more than this, namely that he bestowed less talents and privileges on the one, than on the other. Such a highly figurative way of speaking, distinguishes the Hebrew language from all others, that I am ac∣quainted with; and which if not attended to, we can never understand the scriptures.</P>
<P>We should ever remember, that as all creatures are equally related to GOD by creation; so they are equally loved by him. And if any creature has a greater share in the Creators love than another, it is wholly owing to the improvement the creature has made of the grace the Creator bestowed upon it. The Lord loveth the right∣eous, because they do right: And he hateth the wicked because they do wrong.</P>
<P>We have now considered this chapter, to the 15 ver. so far as we have gone, the Apostle, has considered GOD's choosing or refusing any body of men in general, without supposing them to be wicked, or to have forfeited the di∣vine favour by sin. But it is evident from the scriptural quotations, that from ver. 15 to 23, he considers them in quite another light; namely, as corrupt, wicked and deserving destruction; and as such respited and condi∣tionally pardoned, by the pure mercy of GOD, or ruined by his righteous judgments. Which brings his argu∣ment to the very case of the Jews.</P>
<P>In order clearly to understand the Apostle in these ver∣ses next to be considered, it must be remembered, that the Apostle in the quotations he makes from the Old
<PB N="15" REF="026990_0014_0FD2B4B526F9BCC8"/>
Testament; doth not give the whole of the text, but only a hint or reference to the passages, to which they belong, directing us to recollect, peruse the whole pas∣sages, and there view and judge of the force of his argu∣ments. This is evident from the Apostles having words in his conclusions ver. 16 and 18, which are not in his arguments; as any one may see that reads with atten∣tion.—</P>
<P>This promised we will attend to the Apostles argu∣ment, by which he proves that GOD is sovereign, in ta∣king forfeited favours from a wicked person or people; or in mercy continuing them according to his own good pleasure. For this he quotes the words of GOD to Mo∣ses, recorded Exod. xxxiii. 19, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion. Now in order to under∣stand the Apostles argument from these words quoted by him, we must read and consider well the xxxii and xxxiii chapters of Exodus. And here we find, that while Mo∣ses was in the mount, receiving the law from God, a tu∣multuous address is made by the people to Aaron, up, make us GOD's, &amp;c. In consequence of which, a molten calf is made, and worshipped by the people. Upon which GOD acquaints Moses, with the idolatry of the people, expresseth his displeasure against it, and the re∣solves of his justice to cut them off. Then Moses be∣comes an intercessor; and obtains a reprieve.—And GOD promises to go on with his kind intention of giving them the land of Canaan for all this: Yet he threatens to remember this sin against them, when hereafter he should see cause to punish them for their other sins.</P>
<P>This, as Mr. Henry observes, occasioned this saying among the Jews, that from hence forward no judgment fell upon Israel, but there was in it an ounce of the pow∣der of the golden calf. And even now immediately GOD plagued the people, because of this.</P>
<P>Thus much we find in the xxxii chap. In the xxx<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i chap. we have a further account of the mediation of Moses between GOD and Israel. Moses had obtained see them a promise that the covenant w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th Abraham should
<PB N="16" REF="026990_0015_0FD2B473D1AEFE28"/>
be made good, in giving them the land of Canaan; yet they are denied the extraordinary tokens of GOD's pre∣sence, hitherto enjoyed, and they left to the conduct of Moses, and the convoy of an Angel. But Moses inter∣cedes for the divine presence, and obtains a promise of that also, see ver. 14, And upon Moses' requesting a sight of the divine glory; GOD said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. As if he had said; my goodness is my glo∣ry, and I will make such a display of it before thee, as fully to convince thee, that I am of a kind and benefici∣ent nature. But know thou, that I spare this stiffnecked people, not because either you, who intercede for them, or they themselves, have any claim upon my favour: but of my own free and sovereign grace, I choose to shew them mercy and compassion; and not at this time bring that ruin upon them, which their sin justly deserves. From hence the Apostle concludes, as in ver. 16. So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that run∣neth, but of GOD that sheweth mercy, i. e. the making or continuing any body of men the peculiar people of GOD, after they have by sin forfeited the divine favour, is determined, not by the desires and wishes of men, but by the good pleasure of GOD alone.</P>
<P>For Abraham desired this blessing for Ishmael, and Isaac for Esau, but Abraham and Isaac who willed, and Esau who run for this mercy of being GOD's peculiar peo∣ple, GOD of his mere good pleasure, originally intended first for Isaac, and then for Jacob and his posterity, and to them it was given. And when, by their apostacy, they had forefited this privilege, it was not Moses' wil∣ling, nor any obligation God was under, but his own sovereign mercy which continued the enjoyment of it to them. For instead of shewing the Israelites mercy, and continuing to them the peculiar privileges of his church and people, he might have signalized his anger, power and justice in their destruction; as he did in the case of Pharaoh and the Egyptians.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="026990_0016_0FD2B4B6933E9320"/>To whose case the Apostle alludes in the 17th ver. And observes that although Pharaoh was made to stand through ten plagues, yet was treated with much greater severity then the Jews were, whom God conditionally pardoned, and continued to be his peculiar people, not∣withstanding their rebellion. But the first good oppor∣tunity, to make Pharaoh and the Egyptians an illustrious example of the divine vengeance is taken. Thus it ap∣pears that God treats not all sinners alike, for while with some he waits long, on others he brings a swift destruct∣ion; according to his own good pleasure. From hence the Apostle concludes as in v. 18. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. By mercy here, the Apostle means nothing more, than GOD's respiting a wicked people from deserved ruin, and continuing to them the blessings of providence and the enjoyment of visible Church privile∣ges; is too evident to admit of proof. And that by hardeneth, he means nothing else, than bringing de∣served ruin upon a wicked person or people, is equally plain; as the Apostle evidently alludes to the story of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. To this the Apostle was aware, the Jews would object as in v. 19. Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath resisted his will; i. e. If GOD, according to his own will, thus differently treats criminals, sparing some and bringing ruin upon others: why doth he yet find fault with, and hold guilty those he spares? for if it be his will to spare them, yet hold them guil∣ty and liable to punishment when ever he pleases; they must remain guilty, for who hath resisted his will? To this the Apostle replies v. 20, by shewing that its quite unfit for weak and ignorant man, to retort upon GOD his maker.</P>
<P>In v. 21, the Apostle alludes to the parable of the Potter, Jere. xviii. 1. to illustrate the sovereign right that Almighty God has, to exalt one and depress a∣nother. To make one more honorable and another less honorable, according to his own pleasure. This premis∣ed, the Apostle comes more directly to answer the object∣ion of the Jew, v. 22. What if GOD willing to shew his
<PB N="18" REF="026990_0017_0FD2B4784E549440"/>
wrath, &amp;c. i. e. what can any object against GOD's choosing a time to punish the wicked, according to their wickedness; when it will most redown to his own glory; and suspending their destruction till that time comes? For instance, in the case of the Jews; what wrong is it to them? If GOD designing more signally to display his vindictive justice, and Almighty power, in overthrowing their constitution, nation, and temple, that all may see, and be sensible; that rebellion against him was the cause of their dreadful overthrow, hath thought fit to forbear them with much patience, even when they were proper subjects of punishments, and to respite the destruction they had long deserved, to such a period, as would effec∣tually do this; as he did in the case of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. In the 23d and 24th v. the Apostle, suggests another reason why the Jews were spared so long, name∣ly, that he might display his glorious grace, on those, who before that Judgment was executed on them; were prepared for the honour of being his church and people, in stead of the Jewish nation, i. e. all Christians whom he had called to the faith and privileges of the gospel, not only from among the Jews, but also from among the Gentiles. For although the Jews were fit for de∣struction long before, they were destroyed, yet the fitest time to destroy them, was, after he had prepared the believing Gentiles unto the glory of being his church and people. The Apostle nextly proceeds, by two quotations, from the prophet Hosea, in the 25th and 26th v. to shew that GOD intended to make the Gentiles his people, and declared it by that prophet. Then in, v. 27, 28 and 29. He shews by quotations from the prophet Isaiah, that it is no new thing for GOD to abandon the greatest part of the Jewish nation, when corrupt, and to confine his fa∣vour to a righteous, believing few. Thus having vindi∣cated the rejection of the Jews, from visible Church pri∣vileges; and the calling of the Gentiles thereto, with re∣gard to the divine veracity and justice; the Apostle pro∣ceeds, v. 30, 31 and 32, to give the reason, why the Jews were cast off from being GOD's people, and the Gentiles admitted to that privilege. The Jews for re∣jecting,
<PB N="19" REF="026990_0018_0FD2B4B80F2019D0"/>
the scheme of life, published in the Gospel, are shut out from visible Church privileges; and the Gen∣tiles by embracing it are adopted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the family and Church of God. Then v 33, by a quotation from the prophet Isaiah he shews this rejection of the Jews, and the cause thereof, as he had stated it, was long ago fore∣told.</P>
<P>Thus I have brie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y explained this chapter, about which so much difficulty has been made. And I give it as my opinion, there is not a chapter in the Bible more easy to understand than this, if men would read it without bias, in favour of preconceived opinions.</P>
<P>But as all depends upon the kind of Election and Re∣probation the Apostle is arguing about; mentioned v. 11, That the purpose of GOD according to election might stand, &amp;c. If it be election, by the absolute decree of GOD, to eternal life; and reprobation, by a like abso∣lute decree, to eternal misery: Mr. R. is perfectly right. But if it be only election to some present privileges and external advantages, to be enjoyed in this world; and reprobation, or rejection, as it signifies the not being favoured with those privileges and advantages: Mr. R. is wholly wrong, and has totally mistaken the Apostle in this chapter. Wherefore, I come as proposed.</P>
<P N="3">3. To shew that Mr. R. is totally mistaken, as to what the Apostle means by election and reprobation in this chapter. And this I shall do by the following ar∣guments.</P>
<P>ARGUMENT 1. If the subject of the Apostles argu∣ment, is only such privileges, as were enjoyed by the Isralites in this world; while they remained the church of GOD: Then the election spoke of by the Apostle in this chapter, is not absolute election to eternal life. But, &amp;c.—Ergo.</P>
<P>The major, is evident from the enumeration the Apostle had made of the Israelites privileges, v. 4 and 5. Who are Israelites, to whom pertains the adoption, &amp;c. And these privileges were enjoyed by them in this world, while they were the Church and people of GOD. And it is solely with reference to their being stripped of these privi∣leges,
<PB N="20" REF="026990_0019_0FD2B47DCF4FCCC0"/>
that he vindicates the truth and justice of GOD, it the following verses. Therefore it is not absolute elect∣ion to eternal life that the Apostle here treats of.</P>
<P>ARG. 2. If the election spoke of in this chapter re∣spects all Jacob's posterity, or the whole nation of Israel, then it is not absolute election to eternal life: But, &amp;c.—Ergo—</P>
<P>That the election spoke of in this chapter is rational, is, evident from Gen. xxv. 23. The LORD said unto her, two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels, and the one people shall be stronger than the other people, and the elder shall serve the younger. These are the words which sig∣nify the purpose of GOD according to election. There∣fore the election refers to the whole nation of Israel. But all the nation of Israel were not absolutely elected to eternal life. Therefore, &amp;c.</P>
<P>ARG. 3. If to serve, which was to be the condition of the elder, in scripture, never signifies to be eternally damned in the world to come; then the opposite bless∣ing bestowed upon the younger, could not be eternal salvation. But, &amp;c.—Ergo.—</P>
<P>THAT to serve, was to be the condition of the elder, is plain from the text above quoted, namely, Gen. xxv. 23. But this in scripture never signifies to be eternally damned.—Therefore &amp;c.—</P>
<P>ARG. 4. If the election the Apostle speaks of in this chapter, excludes all works, and is of the mere will of GOD, it is not election to eternal life.</P>
<P>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</P>
<P>That the election spoke of in this chapter, excludes all works is evident from ver. 11.—That it is not election to eternal life is evident, because eternal life is always in scripture said to be of works, though not of works alone.</P>
<P>The argument therefore is conclusive.—</P>
<P>ARG. 5. If the election the Apostle speaks of in this chapter, took place first in Abraham and his seed, before his seed were born; then in Isaac and his seed before they were born; then in Jacob and his seed, before they were born; it is not absolute election to eternal life.</P>
<P>—But &amp;c.—Ergo—</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="026990_0020_0FD2B4B983EC41D8"/>That the election the Apostle speaks of in this chap∣ter, took place as above, needs no proof.—But the scrip∣ture no where represents eternal life, as bestowed upon any family, or race of men in this manner.</P>
<P>Therefore &amp;c.—</P>
<P>ARG. 6. If by vessels of mercy, the whole body of Jews and Gentiles, who were admitted into the kingdom of GOD under the Gospel; is intended, and the whole body of unbelieving Jews intended, by the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction: it is not absolute election to eternal life, that the Apostle treats of in this chapter.</P>
<P>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</P>
<P>Vessels of mercy ver. 23 as manifestly opposed to vessels of wrath ver. 22. But the vessels of mercy are, the whole body of Jews and Gentiles, who were called into the kingdom of GOD under the Gospel, as is evident from ver 24.</P>
<P>Consequently, the vessels of wrath are the whole body of the unbelieving Jews. But men shall not be receiv∣ed to eternal life, or subjected to eternal damnation, at the last day, in collective bodies; but according as par∣ticular persons, in those bodies, have done well or ill.</P>
<P>Therefore &amp;c.—</P>
<P>ARG. 7. If the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction, spake of in this chapter, shall hereafter obtain mercy, and be saved; then it cannot be reprobation to eternal dam∣nation that the Apostle is here arguing about.</P>
<P>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</P>
<P>That in this chapter the Apostle is arguing about the unbelieving nation or people of Israel, and vindicating the truth, and justice of GOD, in their rejection; will be allowed by all. But concerning these reprobates, he heartly desired and prayed that they might be saved, chap. x 1. Affirms that they had not stumbled so as to fall finally, chap. xi. 11. That they should all be saved, ver. 26. That they was still beloved of GOD, ver. 28. That they should at length obtain mercy ver. 31. &amp;c. &amp;c.—</P>
<P>Therefore &amp;c.—</P>
<P>ARG. 8. If the election the Apostle speaks of, and is
<PB N="22" REF="026990_0021_0FD2B4830CE6D370"/>
arguing about in this chapter, may through unbelief and misimprovement be rendered totally void and useless, 'tis not absolute election to eternal life.</P>
<P>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</P>
<P>That the election the Apostle is arguing about in this chapter may, be made void is evident from chapter xi. 20, 21, 22. Well, because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith; be not highminded but fear. For if GOD spare not the natural branches, take heed left he also spare not thee. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of GOD: on them which fell se∣verity; but towards thee goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shall be cut off. Thus evident it is that the election the Apostle here speaks of may be made void and come to nothing.</P>
<P>Therefore &amp;c.—</P>
<P>I think it now appears most plain, that Mr. R. has wholly mistaken the meaning of the Scriptures, he pre∣tends to predicate his discourse upon. And likewise, that what Mr. R. pretends to be the Apostles meaning, is something that lay quite wide of the subject the Apos∣tle was discussing, and could not therefore come into his mind. The ground of Mr. R's mistake is also evident, namely, his not considering the double character of the Deity; as sovereign benefactor and righteous judge; as has been briefly considered above. Mr. R's founda∣tion being now wholly removed, his superstructure must fall to the ground. But as he has advanced several ar∣guments to prove his opinion, so very ill founded upon scripture, or reason: which may be thought, by the less discerning, to have some weight in them, I shall now as proposed proceed.</P>
<P N="4">4. To examine Mr. R's arguments, to evince and il∣lustrate what he calls an, "important doctrine."</P>
<P><Q>ARG. 1. GOD hath an original inalienable right and property in all things. Therefore it belongs to him—is his essential prerogative to have mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will.</Q>
Let it be re∣membered here, that according to Mr. R. eternal salva∣tion is connected with GOD's having mercy, and eternal
<PB N="23" REF="026990_0022_0FD2B4BB0421FBC0"/>
damnation with his hardening. So that the argument stands thus, GOD hath an original inahenable right and property in all things; therefore it belongs to him to save whom he will and damn whom he will. The property of GOD in all things will be allowed by all. But such a use of it as Mr. R. makes is quite new. Holy Job comforts himself with the thought of his being the prop∣erty of GOD: Job, xiv. 15, Thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands. And the Psalmist grounds his plea for mercy on the property of GOD in him: Psal. cxix. 94. I am thine, save me. But Job and the Psalmist lived before Mr. R. doctrine was known; they supposed that GOD's tender mercies were over all his works. But Mr. R. has discovered, that free wrath makes as large, or much larger part of the divine character than free grace!</P>
<P>The ground of Mr. R's mistake is manifest, he did not consider, that saving and damning, rewarding and pun∣ishing, belong not to GOD as sovereign Lord and pro∣prietor; but as righteous lawgiver and judge. We al∣low the premises, but deny his conclusion, as totally void of truth.</P>
<P><Q>ARG. 2. Justice and mercy are essential to the di∣vine character, a character complete in all perfection. Therefore it belongs to GOD to have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and to harden whom he will har∣den.</Q>
Reply, neither justice, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mercy as it respects misery, are exercised or discovered, by withholding or bestowing original favours but these only are given by the mere will, of GOD. We allow the premises, and from thence conclude, that, it belongs not to GOD to have mercy on whom he will, and harden whom he will har∣den.</P>
<P><Q>ARG. 3. GOD actually hath mercy on some, and hardneth others. Therefore it belongs to him to have mercy on whom he will and to harden whom he will.</Q>
Reply, both premises and conclusion are false; for GOD never had mercy on any nor hardened any, in Mr. R's sense of having mercy and hardening. And his will is not the rule by which he proceeds, in saving and damning
<PB N="24" REF="026990_0023_0FD2B4850361DC28"/>
men; but his law The obedient shall be rewarded bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the disobedient shall be punished. But as Mr. R. ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under this argument had recourse to the instance of Pha∣raoh, to prove that GOD hardneth some; I will, for the sake of some who may be imposed upon, by the bare sound of words, attend a little to the scripture account of this matter. I have already observed, that by hardening in Rom. ix. 18. We are to understand ruining.</P>
<P>We will now inquire, what GOD actually did to Pha∣raoh, previous to his bringing ruin upon him. It is true, we are told by Mr. R. that GOD hardened his heart; and we read Exod. vii. 3, that GOD said unto Moses, I will harden Pharaoh's heart. Now if we turn to Exod. viii. 15, we shall gain a just notion in what manner GOD hardened his heart, for it is there written, But, when Pharaoh saw there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them, <HI>as the Lord had said.</HI> And again chap. ix. 34, 35, When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants; and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the people go; <HI>as the Lord had spoken by Moses.</HI></P>
<P>GOD had said, he would harden Pharaoh's heart, and Pharaoh is, in these two places, said to harden his own heart; <HI>as the Lord had said.</HI> Therefore what the Lord had said, is to be explained, by what is here said, (chap. ix. 34, 35) concerning the hardening of Pharaoh's heart. But it is here said that Pharaoh wickedly took occasion, from the respite, which GOD granted him, to harden his own heart. Consequently all that GOD did, towards hardening his heart, was granting him respite, from one plague after another; which indeed, should have soften∣ed his heart. GOD therefore, hardened his heart, only as what GOD did was by him wickedly made the occasion of hardening his own heart in disobedience.</P>
<P>Our Lord tells us Mat. x. 34, 35, I came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d peace, but a sword; for I am come to set a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vari∣ance against his father, &amp;c. Now what did Christ do, to destroy the peace of the world, and the peace of fam∣ilies? Why nothing but publish the glad tidings of sal∣vation,
<PB N="25" REF="026990_0024_0FD2B4C2003AC2F8"/>
and set up his peaceable kingdom in the world. Neither did GOD do any thing to harden Pharaoh's heart, but what should, and would have softened it, had it not been his own fault.</P>
<P><Q>ARG. 4. The potte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hath power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor, and another to dishonor. Therefore it belongs to GOD to have mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will.</Q>
Reply, I deny the conclusion; for rewarding and punishing belong not to creating will and power, but to remunerative justice. GOD may without any injustice, make one vessel more honorable than another; give five talents to one and but two to another, according to his own sovereign pleasure. But his own pleasure is not the rule, by which he will proceed, in rewarding and puni∣shing, but the improvement, or the misimprovement of the talents freely given to each one, to occupy withal. The parable of the potter, Mr. R. calls an
<Q>illuminating proof suggested by Paul himself.</Q>
It is true, it was a good proof, and quite applicable to the subject St. Paul was upon, in the 9th chap. to the Romans, namely GOD's giving, or refusing to give, certain privileges in this life. But Mr. R's subject, is quite different from the Apostles, as it solely respects the distributions of the life to come; a subject totally foreign to the Apostles in the 9th of Romans. The parable of the potter is, therefore totally misapplied by Mr. R. and so likewise the words he has taken from the prophet Isaiah; and fixed as a motto to his discourse. I am sorry to see the scriptures perverted and abused in such a manner, by means of men's mista∣king their true meaning.</P>
<P><Q>ARG. 5. Every possible hypothesis respecting the determination of the character, and disposal of the eter∣nal state of men, except that which is resolved into the wisdom, and good pleasure of the deity, is weak and insufficient if not impious and absurd. Therefore, it be∣longs to GOD—is his essential prerogative to have mer∣cy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will har∣den.</Q>
Reply, this argument is wholly false; both premises and conclusion. I will attend upon Mr. R. in
<PB N="26" REF="026990_0025_0FD2B4868537F7D0"/>
his fruitless endeavour to support it. He begins, by blotting a little more than two pages, in a pretended scuffle with men, angels, and devils, for no purpose that I can see, unless, to show how easy a victory may be gain∣ed, where there is none to oppose.</P>
<P>In page 34 he says,
<Q>In the last place, shall we say this great affair is left to men themselves? Each one is to determine and ascertain his own character and eter∣nal state? This indeed is not merely supposed: but as∣serted, as strenously insisted upon by many. It is not as GOD wills and disposes; but as men themselves will and order. There are who say, men shall be blest as far as man permits; a nature rational implies the pow∣er of being blest or wretched as we please; Heaven wills our happiness, allows our doom; Heaven but per∣suades, almighty man decrees; man is the maker of immortal fates.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If this supposition should fail; I apprehend it will be allowed that every other hypothesis must be given up. Concerning what is now before us, it may be proper to mention several things and proceed by steps.</Q>
I will attend to the things which Mr. R. mentions, and the steps by which he proceeds; to prove that it is not left to every man to determine his own character and eternal state. And then, prove the contrary.</P>
<P>Mr. R. proceeds,
<Q>It may be granted, that it was re∣ferred to Adam (as far as any such thing could be re∣ferred to a creature) to determine his own, and the character and state of his posterity.</Q>
And again he says,
<Q>It may be granted; that in a low qualified sense it was referred to Adam to determine his own, and the char∣acter and state of his posterity, p. 35.</Q>
In p. 28 Mr. R. tells us,
<Q>That the determination of the character, and disposal of the state and circumstances of creatures, par∣ticularly the eternal state of men, is GOD's peculiar pro∣vince, and essential prerogative. That it belongs to him originally and independently; is what he cannot be divested of by any; and indeed is that of which he cannot divest himself; it being essential as absolute per∣fection, involving justice and mercy, is essential, and
<PB N="27" REF="026990_0026_0FD2B4C4329EF818"/>
the denial of it, infering the denial of divine existence·</Q>
Is it possible for Mr. R. to reconcile the 28 and 35 pages, in his discourse? Will these saving words,
<Q>As far as any such thing can be referred to a creature,</Q>
or,
<Q>In a low qualified sense.</Q>
Save him from an open contradiction? especially when according to him, it was granted to Adam, not only to determine his own state, but the state of his posterity; which if true, does not look as if he had it in a 'low qualified sense.' It is much more than I claim for any other man, or believe that Adam ever had. And how Mr. R. will reconcile such an extensive grant, to the wisdom and goodness of GOD, I know not.</P>
<P>Mr. R. says, that in a low qualified sense it was refer∣red to Adam, &amp;c; and then adds,
<Q>And we well know the issue of that trial was sin and ruin.</Q>
It is evident now from Mr. R's own acknowledgement; that this in∣communicable prerogative of Deity, which Deity cannot divest himself of, without denying his own existence; was actually so transferred to Adam, as that he by the trial, determined his own character, to be that of a sin∣ner, and his condition to be ruinous. And as it must be cruel in his maker, to give him power only to destroy himself; and withhold from him power to save himself; we may fairly conclude, that he had, full and complete power given him, by his maker; to be happy or miser∣able according as he should choose.</P>
<P>It is very unlucky for Mr. R. that at his first setting out to disprove a quotation from Dr. Young, he should by his own acknowledgment, so fully prove it. Men shall be blest as far as man permits; a nature rational implies the power of being blest or wretched as we please. We have now Mr. R's testimony to the truth of these lines. Great is the truth and will prevail! But we may not leave Mr. R's first step yet, there is one thing further, which demands our notice; namely, what Mr. R. says of Adam, after allowing, that it was referred to him, to determine his own character, &amp;c. he adds,
<Q>It is certain, however, that Adam had not that liberty of indifference, that self determining power, that power of originating volitions, which is urged by many as being essential to
<PB N="28" REF="026990_0027_0FD2B4884C7C3290"/>
moral agency, and necessary to render the volitions and actions of men worthy of praise or blame. Be∣cause such power and liberty is no where to be found, in men, Angels or the Deity; the very notion being ab∣surd.</Q>
Reply, Who determined Adams will to eat the forbidden fruit? If he did not determine it himself he is most unjustly charged with sin. If he did determine it himself, he had a self determining power. Is it indeed absurd to say, that Deity has a self determining power? I verily thought all who, believe there is a GOD; would al∣low him such a power. For if he be the first cause, how can his volitions, be determined by any cause antecedent or ex∣trinsic to himself? and of divine volitions, are not deter∣minmined by an extrinsic cause, as they cannot be in the first cause; then Deity; if he be the first cause, has a self detering power. And this power GOD has given to me, and every other man; by which I and all other men, deter∣mine our own volitions, i. e. we ourselves will, or choose, we are agents in choosing, and not mere passive beings. On second thought, Mr. R. may think best to allow a self determining power in the Deity. And I do now tell him, that I claim this power for myself, in common, with all other men; and shall do so, until he shall prove it an incommunicable attribute in the Deity; and when ever he shall do that, I shall be quite able to prove, that there is no second being that is an agent. I come now to take notice of Mr. R's second step.</P>
<P N="2">2.
<Q>The work of redemption by CHRIST hath open∣ed the way to prevent the destruction of the human-kind. But it is ever to be remembered, that the work Christ finished on the cross, in it self considered, doth make no alteration in the state of mens minds.</Q>
Re∣ply, it is not reasonable to think that it should; but when this work, with the design and end thereof, came to be published and made known to men, by the preach∣ing of the gospel; it was reasonable to believe it would make an alteration in the state of mens minds; and the history of the acts of the Apostles informs us that it did so. Mr. R. says,
<Q>The bias of their minds while unre∣generated is only in favour of sin.</Q>
Reply, by unre∣generate,
<PB N="29" REF="026990_0028_0FD2B4C5883E90B0"/>
I suppose Mr. R. means men in their natural state; and would be understood to affirm with regard to all such, that the
<Q>bias of their minds is only in favour of sin.</Q>
But what is this, but to slander human na∣ture? Will Mr. R. say, that there are in the nature of man principles of sin? It so, they must be created in and with our nature by GOD; or the production of some evil being, who is in part the author of our nature; which is no other than the Manichean mistake. How contrary is Mr. R's proportion now under consideration, to St. Paul's doctrine, Romans ii. 14, 15. For when the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the thing contained in the law, these having not the law, are a law unto them∣selves: which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing, or else excusing one another. Here the Apostle shows, 1. That those who are without the written law, have a law written in their hearts, which is a self law, or rule of action to them. 2. That this self law, agrees with those things, written in the law of GOD; so that men naturally do the things contained in the law. The spark of reason in man, show∣ing the same light, in its narrow sphere, as the immense ocean of intelligence in the father of Lights; the mind of man naturally harmonizing with the mind and will of GOD. The Apostle demonstrates this by three argu∣ments, 1. The virtuous actions of some heathen, who have no guide but nature, prove, that by nature they know what is right. 2. The force of conscience in them, secret∣ly reproaching them, for their wicked actions. 3. Their debates among themselves, and mutual accusations, or vindications of their conduct. Mr. R. says of natural men, "The bias of their minds is only in favour of sin." St. Paul says they do by nature the things contained in the law. I prefer St. Pauls account of human naure, to Mr R's. Mr. R. adds, certainly it is not in favour of holiness. "By holiness I suppose Mr. R. means obedi∣ence to GOD's Law. Now, St. Paul says, in the text we have been considering, that man do by nature the things contained in the law. How then, can Mr. R.
<PB N="30" REF="026990_0029_0FD2B494D7F387E0"/>
be certain, that mens minds naturally are not in favour of holiness? The law is holy, and men do by nature the duties it requires. Why his reason for this follows, in these words,
<Q>For then there would be no need of be∣ing born again. And our Saviour did not preach and inculcate the truth when he said, except a man be born again he cannot see the Kingdom of GOD.</Q>
Reply, by being born again, I suppose Mr. R. means what i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commonly called conversion, or a means being turned or turning from sin to holiness. And if so; I would ask how our Saviour's making this a necessary qualifica∣tion for heaven obliges us to believe, that the minds of unconverted men are only in favour of sin: and certain that they are not in favour of holiness? He that came to our Lord to be taught the way to eternal life, when directed to keep the commandments, could say all these have I kept. Jesus beholding him loved him, Mark x. 17—21. It is true, Christ tells him, that he lacked one thing; but surely he did not lack every thing.</P>
<P>I think it very reasonable to suppose, that the minds of those born in christian countries, and favoured with a religious education; from their youth up, are averse to the ways of sin in general, and in favour of holiness. And yet they may need conversion from some one way of sin in order to their entering into the kingdom of GOD. Mr. R. concludes that,
<Q>Were the decision, left to men themselves, as the case now stands—the consequence would be no salvation: but destruction to the whole race: notwithstanding what Christ hath done.</Q>
Reply, those who believe this conclusion, must necessarily look upon all concern about their eternal state; as meddling with what belongs not to them. If Mr. R's scheme is right, all instrumental religion is but a farce. What can more effectually destroy religion, than such a con∣clusion, believed and practised upon? But when it is seen, that flander and misrepresentation, are the grounds on which it stands, 'tis hoped that it will not have weight with any.</P>
<P>We see now, that Mr. R. has gained nothing by his second step. His 3d and 4th are so interwoven that we will take them together.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="31" REF="026990_0030_0FD2B4C70F9B54B0"/>
<Q>3. The way of recovery and salvation by Christ being revealed, offers made and calls given to men: should it be conceded, that some may possibly be pre∣vailed upon to accept the proposals of the gospel; without any special supernatural influence to change their hearts, and captivate them to the obedience of Christ: yet it must be uncertain, whether any would comply, it might turn out so in event, that Christ should not see his seed.</Q></P>
<P N="4"><Q>4. This will lay us under a necessity of maintaining that GOD (with awe may it be spoken) hath projected a vague plan—a plan some of the most important parts of which are undetermined—a plan full of uncertainty —the event of which himself could not know before¦hand;—for if there is no certainty who shall, and who shall not be saved, it cannot be known who shall share the saving effects of divine mercy. Because the previ∣ous certainty of an event is implied in the knowledge or fore knowledge of the event. For to know that an event shall take place, when it is uncertain that it will take place, and may never take place, is a contradic∣tion in terms.</Q>
Reply, If I understand Mr. R. here, he means to affirm, that the suspension of special super∣natural influence, leaves it uncertain, even to GOD; whether any who enjoy the gospel, would comply with its terms and be saved: to suppose therefore such a sus∣pension, is the same as to suppose, GOD's plan of salva∣tion, to be vague and unsettled, the event of which him∣self could not know beforehand.</P>
<P>Reply, I will a little examine Mr. R's notion of su∣pernatural influence, and then enquire how the suspension of this supposed influence, makes it uncertain with GOD whether any among men would comply with the propo∣sals of the gospel, and be saved.</P>
<P N="1">1. I am to examine Mr. R's notion of supernatural influence. Now as it is supernatural; it must be some∣thing that does not belong to man's natural composi∣tion, but is above that. Here it may be proper to as∣certain the natural state of man, and the powers he has given him by his creator; that we may the more easily
<PB N="32" REF="026990_0031_0FD2B4994D13D6E0"/>
discern, what he wants of supernatural power or influ∣ence, or whether any at all; in order to his doing his duty. By man in his natural state, I mean, man consid∣ered barely as man, and as the kind has been propagated down from Adam to this day; without any thing super∣added. And the term man, I think conveys an idea of a body fitly organized and formed as our bodies in the general are, and that this body is actuated by a mind, whose principle faculties are intelligence and activity. Intelligence, by which it it capable of thinking or ta∣king in ideas, of reflecting upon things past, present, of to come; according as it has received information from abroad, and of looking into the nature and the conse∣quences of things, and so forming a judgement of the fit∣ness or unfitness of actions; and a faculty power of self-motion or action, by which it moves and directs the body in that way, and to serve such purposes, as it intends. And as this is an idea, which I suppose, is fixed to the term man; and arises from the human composition; so that composition is the effect or produce of nature, and not of any supernatural influence, which operates above, or contrary to those laws. And as man is thus natural∣ly compounded, is he is hereby constituted a moral agent, i. e. he by his natural composition, has power or is at liberty for the choosing or refusing, for the doing or avoiding, either good or evil; and, as such he is ac∣countable for his actions, being capable of approving or disapproving himself to GOD his maker; in the use of those talents committed to his trust.</P>
<P>Now as man is naturally thus fitted for actions, for what does he need supernatural influence? Will any say that supernatural influence is necessary, to enable man to perform the duty which GOD requires of him. I answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. This is to reflect, and most severely censure the wisdom and goodness of GOD, in giving laws to his creatures.</P>
<P N="2">2. This is to destroy the binding force of the law, and fully justify the transgressor, for no law can bind beyond the ability of those to whom it is given; nor is any man to blame for breaking a law that he cannot keep.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="33" REF="026990_0032_0FD2B4C8C9C1A670"/>3. Whatever is done by supernatural influence, is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the nature of obedience or virtue. The command is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>upposed to be given to man, but he has no power to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bey; obedience is performed by GOD; and to him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orketh is the reward due; and consequently, it is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, but GOD himself, which in the fitness of things, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he proper object of reward, in this case. By a supernatur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l influence B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alam's Ass spake and reasoned; but will any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpute virtue to the beast? I have ever supposed, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose who talk about supernatural influence, use words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithout ideas. I never saw any that would pretend, that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his supernatural influence they plead for, adds any new <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mber to the body, or new faculty to the soul. Hence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il the good or evil a man ever does, he does it by that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bility which arises from his natural composition.</P>
<P>Furthermore, this supposed supernatural influence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither destroys man's natural liberty or it does not: if it does not destroy natural liberty, men may use it to bad purposes as will as their natural powers. If it does des∣troy their liberty, then surely there is no more religion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n any thing they do by virtue thereof, than there was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he fishes swallowing up and vomiting out the Prophet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y supernatural influence. I know some are fond of de∣preciating the natural ability in man, and crying up that which is supernatural, ascribing all the good man does to a supernatural power. But surely they forget that man's natural powers are as truly derived from GOD; as any thing he can receive which is supernatural. How then can men think that they give great glory to GOD, by undervaluing the natural abilities of man? When we consider, that whatever is done, by this supposed super∣natural influence; as it is really above man's agency, so he has no hand in it; 'tis done by another, and the man not one whit the better, or more deserving on that account: But like the crow that fed the Prophet, by supernatural influence, yet a stranger to christian charity, and destitute of a gospel title to its rewards. I say, when we consider this, is it not strange to hear men speak of supernatural influence, so very respectfully? should any say that by supernatural influence, they do not mean GOD's act∣ing
<PB N="34" REF="026990_0033_0FD2B49AC4879F48"/>
without the agency of man; but GOD's co-opperatin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with man, and thereby enabling him to perform th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good, which without such a co-operation, he could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do. I answer, that this has, I believe been the case i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some instances; But generally it is not so. Sampson b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the co-opperation of GOD, broke his cords and with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> jaw bone of an Ass slew a thousand men; but such in¦stances are very fare.</P>
<P>Men do good generally by their natural ability, with out any such co-opperation of GOD. And let it be re¦membered here, that if GOD does co opperate with ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at any time, yet this does not add to the virtue or good¦ness of the being he co-operates with; because the virtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or goodness of any agent arises from the right exercise o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such power, as is exerted by his own will and agency an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not in the exercise of such power as is exerted by the wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and agency of another. If it should be urged, that, by su∣pernatural influence, man does not receive any new abili∣ty, strictly speaking; but he receives a disposition, to make a right use of the ability that he has, which dispo∣sition, he would not have, without a divine supernatural influence; but would be disposed to the contrary. I an∣swer, the strength of this objection lies in the improper use of the word disposition; and in order to remove it I would observe, that we have before shown, that intelli∣gence and activity are necessary to constitute a moral agent. And as motive, which takes place in the under∣standing, and which is the product of intelligence, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> necessary to action, because the active faculty will not be exerted, without some previous reason to dispose the mind to action: hence it appears, that, when a man is said to be disposed, to one action rather than another, nothing is intended thereby but the prevaling influence, that one motive has upon a man to produce action, above what all others have to produce the contrary. For a motive is the ground and reason of action, so the motive that prevails disposes the agent to act. And every mo∣tive is what it is in its self, either good or evil, antece∣dent to, and independent of any divine determination concerning them. When therefore, it is said that man
<PB N="35" REF="026990_0034_0FD2B4D3C4AC1F08"/>
cannot make a right use of his ability, except GOD by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> supernatural influence gives him a disposition; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erm disposition, must signify either, 1 The giving a power to distinguish betwixt one motive and another, and so to judge of their moral fitness or unfitness; or a A power to act from right motives, when such are pre∣sent to the mind: or 3 The presenting such motives to the mind, as are necessary to excite to right action.</P>
<P>Now if by a disposition is meant either of the two first, it is false to say, that man would not have a disposition to make a right use of the ability he has without super∣natural influence, because what is here supposed to be given by supernatural influence, is what man has by his natural composition; and that by which he is constituted a moral agent, as I have shown above. Take away these powers or either of them, and men are no more sub∣jects of moral government, or accountable for their ac∣tions, than the beasts of the field. But if by giving a disposition is meant the presenting such motives to the mind, as are necessary to excite to right action, and that such action cannot take place, except those motives are thus presented. Then I answer, it is true that a good and virtuous action cannot take place without a proper motive to excite to it, and that GOD may, and I believe often does, kindly interpose, and by his holy spirit, pre∣sent proper motives to the mind, which motives so pre∣sented, become the ground and reason of good action of∣ten times. But then it is to be remembered,</P>
<P N="1">1. That such an interposition, of the father of spirits to assist our minds, is not, always necessary to right action, because the fitness or unfitness of our actions in general, is plain to be seen, without such help.</P>
<P N="2">2. When GOD does at any time interpose and by his holy spirit present motives to the mind, this divine op∣peration, is not the physical, nor the moral cause of the right action that follows. For as the fitness of the action arises from the nature of things; so our seeing that fitness, and acting agreeable to it, is no other than the exercise of that ability, which arises from our natural composition; and all that GOD does is only instrumentally making that
<PB N="36" REF="026990_0035_0FD2B49C97BD35A0"/>
motive present to the mind, which is the excitement t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> right action: which motive might have been presente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some other way, and if it had, it would have produced the same action. So that, strictly speaking GOD never gives any disposition at all but 'tis wholly by the exercise of men's natural powers that they are disposed this way or that.</P>
<P>Furthermore, should any say, that though man, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his natural capacity, is an agent, yet his agency is con∣fined to things natural and rational; but as to things spiritual, he has no agency, until by a supernatural influ∣ence, he is put into a capacity therefor. This I suppose is Mr. R's real sentiment, if I can understand him; and in several parts of his discourse, more or less clearly ex∣pressed.</P>
<P>See p. 18 and 19,
<Q>In regeneration and sanctification the scriptures ascribe a peculiar interposition and influ∣ence to God.—According to scriptural representation there seemeth to be a peculiar, and what hath been cal∣led supernatural influence, in producing holy pecep∣tions and volitions, which influence is over and above the general influence—extrinsic exertion, necessary to prepare the way for perceptions and volitions, to take place in creatures, i. e. to enable them to understand and choose.—Sinful exercises may be conceived of as taking place, without any other kind of influence—ex∣trinsic exertion, than what is necessary to enable men to understand choose and act.</Q></P>
<P>If I understand Mr. R. he means to hold forth, that over and above that general influence of GOD, by which all men are able to understand, choose and act; there is a special, peculiar, supernatural influence necessary, in order to men's converting from sin, or becoming holy. By a general influence men can understand choose and act; as Mr. R. tells us; but they can only understand, choose and act in the common affairs of life. He doth not mean to extend this power, to religious, holy ac∣tions; for with regard to these he tells us, that super∣natural influence is necessary to produce them. So that I think it is plain, that Mr. R. considers the agency of
<PB N="37" REF="026990_0036_0FD2B4D3C8036058"/>
a natural man to be confined, to things rational and nat∣ural; but as to spiritual things men have no agency, un∣til by a supernatural influence they are put into a capaci∣ty therefor. To this, I shall in this place, only say, that if Mr. R. and others of his opinion are right, there must be two sets of powers in man, for the performance of good, one for temporal and the other for spiritual good. But, to me, this appears a mere fiction, both reason and scripture agree, that it is by one set of powers, namely, the human composition, that we perform all good, whether it relates to this life or a better, and by which we please either man or GOD. The same tongue with which we bless GOD, we curse men, out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing, James iii. 9, 10. It is by the same passion of fear, that men are lead to guard against the evils of this life, and of another.</P>
<P>It is the same natural passion of hope, which excites men to prosecute there present and future happiness. It is by the same natural power, that a man loves GOD and his neighbour; which is the fulfilling of the law, and which will render him acceptable to his maker, and by which he loves any thing, that renders this life agree∣able to him. Only the affection is exercised on differ∣en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> objects, and to a different degree, and it becomes either virtuous or vicious as it is exercised upon a pro∣per, or an improper object; or as it is kept within, or is indulged beyond its due bounds. It is the same nat∣ural active faculty, or power of self-motion, by which a man uses the members of his body, to commit murder or to save from death. The case is the same with regard to all the parts of our composition, and with regard to all the good which is performed by us.</P>
<P>And I do hereby call upon Mr. R. to give a case, in which it will appear, that the natural man, has not abili∣ty to perform any one branch of goodness, that will ren∣der him acceptable to his maker. Our understandings may be enlightened, by truths brought to their view by the holy spirit of GOD; which otherwise they might have remained ignorant of, or might not have attended to, and truth thus presented, may become the ground or rea∣son
<PB N="38" REF="026990_0037_0FD2B4A4E748EA50"/>
of action. And if Mr. R. chooses to call this by the name of supernatural influence, I will not contend about words. Yet let it be remembered, that this does not in the least affect our liberty, nor give us any new agency. But man is just the same nature he was before, in that respect: his actions are performed in the same way, by the same natural faculties of intelligence and ac∣tivity, as they were, antecedent to that illumination. How different soever the ways are, by which man's un∣derstanding receives information, the faculty remains the same, being no more than a natural faculty. And if ac∣tion follows a judgement, made up by means of truth suggested by the holy spirit; that action is performed by men's natural faculty or power of self motion, exerted and directed by his intellectual faculty.</P>
<P>Thus I have a little examined Mr. R's. notion of super∣natural influence, and to it appears a mere fiction: As it must, I think be evident to every discerning person, that it is by man's natural agency, he performs all the actions which are performed by him. And if he is ever, by another made an instrument, in matters wherein he has no agency, or that are above his agency, he is cer∣tainly nothing the better for that; there being nothing of the nature of virtue in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. I come as proposed to enquire, how the suspension of this supposed supernatural influence, makes it uncer∣tain with God, whether any among men would comply with the proposals of the gospel and be saved. Were it uncertain only with men, there would be no inconven∣lency in it; as it would be equally uncertain, whether any one would fail of a compliance and salvation. But if it be as Mr. R. says, an event which God himself could not know beforehand; God's plan is vague and uncertain.</P>
<P>Mr. R. tells us p. 37.
<Q>It is no limitation of divine knowledge to say, GOD cannot know that which is un∣knowable.</Q>
But how does it appear, that, it is a thing unknowable how men under the gospel will choose and act, without supernatural influence to assist them? Mr. R. has offered no evidence of this, only saying,
<PB N="39" REF="026990_0038_0FD2B4D551273088"/>
"It must be uncertain," which is far from being satisfac∣tory to me. Is it not true, that the knowledge of the Deity is uncreated, underived, self existing, independ∣ant of any cause or medium whatever; essential to the very existence of Deity, and necessarily implied in the very idea of GOD; who by one simple eternal act of his understanding, knows all things that have been, that are, that ever will be, and that never will be.</P>
<P>It is evident to me, that Mr. R. supposes that GOD cannot know things properly contingent, that may or may not be, for ought that he hath decreed about them. Such as the choice, and actions of voluntary agents. And this false notion has doubtless misled him. If the above definition of the divine knowledge is just; his mistake is thereby detected. But as this is a matter of the greatest importance, I will take it up a little more largely. And the contingency of some events in respect of GOD, may be proved thus; GOD hath decreed, that all his creaturs should ordinarily work according to their several kinds and endowments, by which he in the creation distinguish∣ed them. For illustration, they may be ranked into three several forms. In the lowest stand the mere natural a∣gents, inanimate and senseless creatures. To these God hath given certain instincts and inclinations, by which they are determinately swayed to these or those certain ef∣fects and operations, unless they are outwardly hinder∣ed; for heavy bodies cannot choose but defend, fire can∣not choose but burne.</P>
<P>In the second stand the sensitive creatures, beasts, sowls, fishes, &amp;c. to these GOD hath given sense and knowledge to discern what is good for their nature, and what is bad; and among many goods, to prefer that which is best, he hath given them also a free appetite, or a kind of sensitive will, by which they may either freely prosecute, or avoid, such objects as they like or dislike; not determinately tied to this or that operation, as the other were. A stone cannot but descend, but a beast may as well go up hill as down. In the upper form are men, reasonable crea∣tures, whom GOD hath made more voluntary than the other, by giving them greater freedom of choice, and pre∣senting
<PB N="40" REF="026990_0039_0FD2B4A4EB936928"/>
unto their more elevated knowledge, a greater variety of objects. Now, without doubt, GOD has dis∣tinguished his creatures in abilities and faculties, that they might operate in their several kinds; that the natu∣ral agents might work naturally, the voluntary, volun∣tarily. The truth of this I think no man will deny ex∣plicitly; but see the consequence which follows most un∣deniably.</P>
<P>If GOD hath decreed, that many things should be done voluntarily by his creatures; then hath he decreed that many things should be done contingently in respect of him: but the first is granted, therefore the second must. The connexion I prove thus. All things are done con∣tingently in respect of GOD, which for ought he hath de∣creed, might with as much possibility not be as be. But all things which are done by the creatures voluntarily, may as well not be done as done: therefore, if he hath decreed, that many things shall be done voluntarily, he hath also decreed, that they should be done contingently. The minor is evident; because if the creatures may not as well omit them as do them, they do them not voluntarily, but necessarily. Hence we see, that contingency is necessary in respect of GOD's will, who will have many things done voluntarily; otherwise he would never have given his creatures wills. Now to say, that GOD cannot know things that are contingent, that may be, or may not be, according to the will of the creature; is the same as to say, that GOD's knowledge is but finite. For infinity of Knowledge must respect either the number of objects, or the manner of comprehending them. But as no number can be infinite, since it may be doubled and trebled: knowledge in this respect can be but finite. But when we believe, that GOD from eternity decreed that volun∣tary agents should have liberty to do, or not to do, and after what manner they pleased; so that for any necessity imposed upon their actions by him, whatsoever they omit was as possible to be done, as what they did — And yet from eternity knowing whatsoever his creatures would do, or not do, his knowledge must be infinite, and most admirable. Infinite, not in respect of the number of ob∣jects,
<PB N="41" REF="026990_0040_0FD2B4D6D6EC5CC8"/>
for so no knowledge can be: but in respect of the boundless manner of actual comprehending those things with an infallible fore-sight, which in respect of GOD were contingent, their not being as possible as their being. This is the royal prerogative of divine knowledge: and hence in the 41st of Isaiah, GOD upbraideth the Pagan deities with this privilege peculiar to himself.—From what has been observed, is it not apparent, that there is no previous or antecedent certainty in the things them∣selves, upon which the divine prescience is founded.— This shows us the weakness and fallacy of Mr. R's rea∣soning, when he says, as in p. 37,
<Q>If there is no cer∣tainty who shall, and who shall not be saved, it can∣not be known who shall share the saving effects of di∣vine mercy, because the previous certainty of an event, is imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in the knowledge, or fore knowledge of the event.</Q></P>
<P>By certainty here, Mr. R. must mean some medium distinct from the event, and by which it is made known. But had Mr. R. considered, that the knowledge of the Deity is an essential attribute; independent of his decree, or any other act of his own, much less the actions of any finite or created being, he would never have reasoned thus. I would ask Mr. R. how the Saviour knew, that Sodom would have remained to his day, if the mighty works had been done in it, which were done in Capernaum? Will he say, the event was certain previous to its being known! It is very evident to me, that Mr. R. does not consider the difference between the knowledge of Deity, and our knowledge. It is readily granted, that such finite im∣perfect creatures as we are, cannot possibly know that any future event will certainly take place, unless it be necessarily connected with something that has a present existence; for all we know, must either be self evident, or evident by proof, i. e. It must be connected with some cause or medium known to us at present, from which we can with certainty infer its future existance. Our knowledge is thus limited and confined, because wholly <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b extra.</HI> We having no innate stock of knowledge. But if Deity cannot know things, but only in this way,
<PB N="42" REF="026990_0041_0FD2B4A6CC626130"/>
how came he by the idea of possible existence? Upon the whole it now fully appears, that Mr. R. is greatly mis∣taken, in saying, "GOD could not know what would be the event of things in the system." Upon the suspension of supernatural influence. All therefore, that he infers from hence about the plan of GOD, as vague and full of uncertainty, is without the least foundation. Thus I have followed Mr. R. four steps, without geting any near∣er, the point he set out for.</P>
<P>His 5th and 6th steps, have not so much as the shadow of an argument in them, being wholly recapitulatory, and anticipating a conclusion, from premises that are doubtful, not to say openly false. His 7th step is in∣troduced thus, p. 38.</P>
<P N="7"><Q>7. This dilemma is unavoidable. Either the Deity hath no will, no pleasure respecting the salvation, and damnation of the individuals of the human race, or his counsel doth not stand; unless it be true that he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and hardeneth whom he will, as fully and definitively as hath been mentioned.</Q>
Reply, GOD hath a will and pleasure re∣specting the salvation and damnation of men, and has re∣vealed and published it in his word; namely, that the righteous shall be rewarded, and the wicked punished: for he will render to every man according to his works. Which revelation, of GOD, is openly contrary to the sentiment advanced by you, and if true yours must be false. Now Sir, what becomes of your <HI>Crocodilinus</HI>? But it seems you were aware of the weakness of your di∣lemma; for a little below you say,
<Q>And for any to urge, that the divine will is conditional. There is nothing definititvely fixed in the divine mind respecting the in∣dividuals that shall be saved, or that shall perish, only this in general: He is resolved to have mercy on all that repent, and to harden and destroy all those who remain impenitent. And this being the sum of his will and counsel: he not only hath a will in the matter; but his counsel must stand, let it fall as it may with the individuals of the human race. I say to urge this, will afford no relief.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="026990_0042_0FD2B4D84A1D89E0"/>But pray why doth it not afford relief? Why doth it not destroy your dilemma? You have a pretended rea∣son ready, we will attend to it.
<Q>Because repentance is implied in GOD's having mercy on any in the sense of the text.</Q>
Reply, Unhappy for you Sir, that you had not known the meaning of your text, before you un∣dertook to preach from it; and I fear it may be so to some of your readers. But as I have fully proved, that the text has no such meaning as you give it; that it was what could never come into St. Paul's mind when he wrote it; as it lay quite wide of his subject: you must look up some better reason in future, or people will think that the divine will may be conditional. Thus we have followed Mr. R. seven steps, and are quite as far from the point, as when we set out. His eighth and last step followeth.</P>
<P N="8"><Q>8. Therefore on the whole, since a denial that it be∣longs to GOD — is his essential prerogative, to have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and to harden whom he will; is so full of weakness and absurdity. Since there are no other beings to whom it doth or can belong. And since the admission of this sets GOD up∣on the throne; subjecting the materals of the intellectu∣al world, to his authority and will. And in fine leads us to see how his own, which are the wisest and best ends, may be certainly and infallibly accomplished. We ought to be established in a clear conviction, and full persuasion of this great truth: that it belongs to GOD, is his essential prerogative, to determine the character, and dispose of the eternal state of men; in holiness, and salvation; or in sin and damnation according to his own good pleasure.</Q>
As here is no argument of∣fered, I shall reply by only saying. Therefore on the whole, since we see a gentleman of fine learning, of good discerning, of mature age and judgement, devoted to study and find out truth, and discover it for the benefit of others; and under the best advantages so to do: so compleatly baffled, in his endeavours to prove, that it does not belong to men, to determine their own state and condition in the world to come. We ought to be estab∣lished
<PB N="44" REF="026990_0043_0FD2B4A8516EE018"/>
in a clear conviction, and full persuasion, that this good Gentleman did really undertake a forlorn hope. And have our minds prepared to receive evidence to the contrary to which I shall now proceed as proposed. I have attended Mr. R. in his struggle, to prove that it does not belong to men, to determine their own charac∣ter and state in the world to come; and find him whol∣ly failing. But this is not to be wondered a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, since what he undertook to prove is against both reason and scrip∣ture; and renders them both wholly useless unto men as bound for eternity.</P>
<P>I will now undertake to prove the contrary; a task I should not have thought of undertaking, had not Mr. R. denied it. But I am apprehensive of no difficulty, but what will arise to me, from the propositions being to near a kin to a self-evident one; that it may be difficult to find proof clearer than the thing to be proved. However I will try with Mr. R. help to set this matter beyond dispute. I am greatly obliged to Mr. R. for saving me the trouble, of an enquiry into the liberties and privileges of the first man; by freely acknowledging, that what he calls an essential prerogative of Deity; and what Deity could not divest himself of, was actually transfered to him; and that in a more full, ample and extensive man∣ner, than I could desire.</P>
<P>Now that it does belong to men themselves to deter∣mine their own character and eternal state; I offer the following arguments as proof.</P>
<P>ARGUMENT 1. If the divine favour and acceptance depends wholly upon what men do: It belongs to them to determine their own character and eternal state. But the divine favour and acceptance depends wholly on what men do—Ergo—</P>
<P>Mr. R. has made it unnecessary for me to say any thing about the first man; but if we may receive for truth what Moses has related, concerning GOD's treatment of the second man, my argument is fully established, from one single text of scripture; namely, that in Gen. iv. 7, If thou doest well, shall thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. The context tells
<PB N="45" REF="026990_0044_0FD2B4DC39890CB8"/>
us that Cain and Abel brought their offerings—That GOD had respect unto Abel and to his offering: but unto Cain, and to his offering he had no respect. This made Cain very angry, and his countenance fell, upon this therefore Almighty GOD condescends to reason with him as in the text.—Here the great GOD lays down the rule of judgment, that rule by which he would proceed in distributing rewards and punishments to men. And it is done in such a way as to show that Cain was fully ac∣quainted with this before, and knew well the terms of ac∣ceptance with GOD; for it is put by way of question, which is a pointed way of speaking, and suppose the case to be quite plain. <HI>If thou doest well,</HI> i. e. If thou had'st brought such an offering, as thy circumstances enabled thee, and as might be justly expected from thee; and with such a temper of mind, as thou mightest and ough∣test to have done, and as thy brother did. <HI>Shouldest thou not be accepted?</HI> Yes, surely, it would have been wrong, unjust and unequal in me to have rejected thee and thy of∣fering; and this thou doest fully know. <HI>And if thou doest not well,</HI> i. e. doest evil, when thou hadest power and wast at liberty to do the contrary, <HI>Sin lieth at the door.</HI> Thou oughtest in all reason to expect to reap the fruit of thy folly and wickedness; thy resentment there∣fore is most unreasonable.</P>
<P>I ask now, why Almighty GOD made this difference between these two brothers and their offerings? The an∣swer must be, because one did well and the other ill. I therefore say, if we may receive for truth what Moses has here related, it is certain that it did belong to Cain and Abel, to determine their own character and eternal state. And consequently to the whole posterity of Adam, to the end of the world. The divine favour depending wholly on the improvement men make of the talents committed to their trust; it belongs solely to them to determine their eternal state.</P>
<P>ARG. 2. If GOD sets life and death before men, and leaves it to them to choose either: it belongs to men to determine their own character and future state.</P>
<P>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="026990_0045_0FD2B4A9C53538B0"/>If we may credit the writings called sacred, this argu∣ment may be fully supported from many passages in them; particularly Deut. xxx. 15, 16, See I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; in that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy GOD, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, that thou mayest live. Verse 19, I call heaven and earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death, bles∣sing and cursing: therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live.</P>
<P>ARG. 3. If GOD promises life to the righteous, and threateneth death to the wicked: it belongs to men to determine their own character and future state.</P>
<P>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</P>
<P>The sacred writings are full of promises to the righte∣ous, and threatenings to the wicked. One instance may suffice. See Isa. iii. 10, Say ye to the righteous it shall be well with him▪ for they shall eat the fruit of their doings; v. 11, Woe unto the wicked; it shall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be given him. But none can be righteous but by doing right, or wick∣ed but by doing wrong. 1 John. iii. 7, He that doeth righteousness is righteous. It is men themselves there∣fore, that determine their own character and eternal state; and none other can do it for them.</P>
<P>ARG. 4. If GOD requires obedience of men, as a con∣dition of his favour and eternal happiness, it belongs to men to determine their own character and eternal state.</P>
<P>But &amp;c.—</P>
<P>The sacred writings assure us that GOD does require obedience of men in order to happiness. Acts xvii. 3. GOD now commandeth all men every where to repent. Rom. ii. 6, 7, 8, GOD will render to every man accor∣ding to his deeds: to them, who, by patient continu∣ance in well doing, eternal life; but unto them that do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indigna∣tion and wrath. Therefore it belongs to men to deter∣mine their own character and eternal state.</P>
<P>ARG. 5. If men will be finally justified, or condemned
<PB N="47" REF="026990_0046_0FD2B4E1A3F3EF08"/>
by their works, it belongs to men to determine their own character and eternal state.</P>
<P>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</P>
<P>If the draught and scheme our Lord has given of the judgment of the great day, in Mat. xxv. 31—46 may be relied upon for truth my argument is fully supported. I have founded all these arguments, upon scripture; thinking it would be more agreeable to reading in gene∣ral; as the scriptures are by most people, in our coun∣try, considered as a good history of divine revelation. But it is quite as easy to demonstrate from reason, with∣out the aid of scripture; that it belongs to men to deter∣mine their own character and eternal state. That it is utterly unfit, yea, in the nature of things impossible, that the character and state of men should be determined by any other than themselves. As must appear I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every one, that considers what is meant by the term man. I come as proposed, 5 To consider Mr. R's answers to objections against his doctrine.</P>
<P><Q>OBJ. 1. The preceeding representation must necessa∣rily be contrary to truth, and is really chargeable with blasphemy: for it makes GOD the author of sin.</Q>
Mr. R. allows that if by author of sin,
<Q>is meant acting, loving sin, or being a sinner, to say that GOD is the author of sin would be full of blasphemy. And any scheme any sentiment fairly implying this, ought to be rejected with the greatest abhorrence.</Q>
That the prece∣ding representation is contrary to truth I have proved already. That it is full of blasphemy and ought to be rejected, according to Mr. R's own confession, I will now prove. By making it fully appear, that Mr. R's scheme, does really make GOD the actor or doer of all sin. And that it does so, all must see, when they take into view the whole quantum of liberty that Mr. R. allows unto men. This we find in p. 43, 44.
<Q>Men are not machines, are not acted like machines when they are hardened in sin: for they are voluntary, they move and act of choice, whereas in a mere machine there is no volition. It is acted upon but doth not act, doth not put forth any exertion. There is then an essential dif∣ference.
<PB N="48" REF="026990_0047_0FD2B4E68564EF88"/>
A mere machine cannot exercise liberty, can∣not be to blame, because it has no design, no volition. But GOD in hardening sinners doth not influence them in any such manner, as to prevent sin being their own act, or to prevent their acting of choice, and because they act voluntarily, respecting that which is evil and and make the evil their own, they are to blame, are wholly without excuse, sinners are not compelled to do wickedly, whatever extrinsic influence there is in the production of volition it is not of the nature of com∣pulsion. For we mean by compulsion, that power which effects a thing against or at least without our will or consent. The most hardened sinners are, to all in∣tents moral agents and accountable because they act freely.</Q></P>
<P>According to Mr. R. all the difference between men and machines, is, that men choose, or act of choice, but a mere machine does not. He tells us that men are not acted like a windmill, because they act of choice, and the whole amount of liberty he allows men is liberty of choice; and because they act voluntarily, he says, they are to all intents moral agents and accountable; and be∣cause they choose that which is evil, he fixes blame upon them.</P>
<P>But are any so blind as not to see that the beasts of the field, and the birds of the air, enjoy liberty in as full, complete, and ample a manner as men, according to Mr. R. for they will and choose what they do as really as men; and it may with as much truth, be said of them, as of men, that they do as they are pleased to do. That they act freely, voluntarily and with liberty. But I never supposed until I read Mr. R's discourse, that they were accounted by any to be moral agents. But suppo∣sed that they were considered as without blame, because they had no power over their volitions. They being ef∣fects produced in them by the operation of causes, not within their governing command. So likewise mad men, their actions are voluntary, they do nothing but in con∣sequence of previous will and pleasure; but who, except Mr. R. ever thought they were moral agents, and their
<PB N="49" REF="026990_0048_0FD2B4E429462980"/>
actions morally good or evil! Now what is the reason that men, 'till Mr. R. appeared in print, have thought so differently of the actions of distracted men, and others who have the full use of their mental powers? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hy the true and only reason is, the former are hurried on to vo∣lition by a wild impetuous, over which they have no power; but the latter have it in their power to restrain and govern their wills and choices.</P>
<P>We feel in ourselves, not only a power to will, but a power over our volitions; and such an one as enables us to direct, suspend, overrule, or put an intire stop to them: nor, unless we were possessed of this dominion, could we be agents; however great liberty might be al∣lowed us in bringing into event what we have previously willed. It is essential to free agency, and such a use of it as to make us capable of good or ill desert, that our volitions upon which our actions follow, should be with∣in reach of our command. The plain truth is, such a power in men as will make them causes, real proper cau∣ses of their volitions, and the effects consequent upon them, is the grand supporting pillar of the world con∣sidered as moral. Take this away, and it at once falls into desolation and utter ruin. If men's volitions, and their consequent effects, are the result of invariable ne∣cessity, in virtue of exterior causes so inviolably connec∣ted, as that they will and must come to pass, the author of this connection, which, according to Mr. R. is GOD, is the only agent in out world, and the only efficient, and real author, of whatever has been, or shall hereafter be brought into event; not excluding any of the most complicated villanies that have been, or may be perpe∣trated by any of the sons of Adam.</P>
<P>Thus plain it is, that Mr. R's scheme makes the ever glorious GOD, the actor of all sin and wickedness that ever was, or ever will be in our world. It is therefore according to his own acknowledgment, blasphemous and ought to be rejected with the greatest abhorrence.</P>
<P>Mr. R's scheme makes it necessary that GOD should some how or other, be the author of sin, and hence he labours this, to the utmost of his ability; and even quite
<PB N="50" REF="026990_0049_0FD2B4E505611728"/>
beyond his ability. In p. 41 he says,
<Q>Certainly, it is too much for any to say he (GOD) could not possibly have prevented it.</Q>
Lest some, less discerning, should be misled by this, and too easily go into the opinion, that sin does belong to GOD's plan, is really agreeable to his dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tive will, as Mr. R. says. I would in the first place observe. That moral evil as distinguished from natural, is essentially connected with free agency, in the beings upon whom this guilt is fastened. It's nature consists in wrong determinations, and disorderly conduct, which yet are voluntary, and argue a wilful misapplication of moral and rational powers. Free agents therefore, them∣selves, and not GOD, are the sole and proper authors of it. It takes rise intirely from them, and would never have been but for their corrupt choices, and voluntary perversion of faculties, which they might have employed to wise and good purposes. And shall a production wholly owing to creatures, and which never could have existed, had they not abused their powers, be charged to the ever glorious GOD! How surprizing, that it should ever enter into the heart of any man, that sin belongs to GOD's plan, is agreeable to his decretive and providen∣tial will! Secondly, I would observe, that since GOD is a being of infinite purity and holiness, I think he must have prevented sin if he could have done it. Yet let it be remembered that I have not so much respect to a nat∣ural, as to a moral ability; an ability invariably, guided, in all its exertions, by present wisdom, and the reason and nature of things.</P>
<P>I think in this sense, it was not in the power of the great first cause, to have prevented moral defection. If it was, why was it not done? and in what possible way can the now prevention of it be reconciled with infinite holiness and goodness? whereas if GOD could not pre∣vent it, in consistency with wife and fit conduct, it is a good reason why he did not do it. And this I verily be∣lieve to be the case; and therefore differ from Mr. R. as certain as he is, and think that it is not too much for us to say, that GOD could not possibly prevent sin. I will give my reasons for differing from Mr. R. in this
<PB N="51" REF="026990_0050_0FD2B510CAE74A50"/>
point; and submit them to the judicious. If GOD could prevent sin it must be one of these ways, viz. Either by not giving free agents a place in the scale of beings; or by making them so perfect as to be incapable of any wrong conduct; or by interposing at all times, as occasion might require, to hinder the misu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of moral powers, in beings that possess them, either in a higher or lower de∣gree. Now, as to the first, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> agents <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> place in the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ale of be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have re∣duced the communicative goodness of GOD to a very pit∣tance, comparatively speaking: and the good enjoyed must have been of the lowest kind too, for there is no pleasure like that which is intellectu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and moral, none so noble and divine in its nature, none so satisfying to the subjects of it. Further were the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no mortal agents, there would be no way for the Deity to manifest his mor∣al glory, which is his greatest. No manifestation of holiness, justice, goodness, mercy, forbearance, long-suffering, forgiveness. If no free agents, there could be no virtue, in a word, there could be no such thing as moral government, without which, the richest displays of the most amiable perfection could have no place in the creation. This considered, will it not be thought quite unfit that the blessing of moral liberty should be withheld. As to the second, viz. by making free agents so perfect as to be incapable of wrong conduct. But is not this im∣possible in the nature of things? As creatures with all their perfections, would yet be finite, and how intelligent moral beings that are finite should be wholly incapable of becoming faulty, in any kind, or degree, is beyond all conception, to me it appears reasonable to think, that the infinitely perfect Being is the only one that can be absolutely impeccable. But should it be supposed na∣turally possible in consistency with wise and fit conduct in the Deity? Perhaps thus speaking it is not possible. So far as our knowledge extends, it is certain, that in∣tilligent moral beings are not when they first come into existance, either so perfect or happy as they may be. But are so formed as to be capable of progress, both in perfection and happiness; which progress depends much
<PB N="52" REF="026990_0051_0FD2B4E8213B33C0"/>
on the use they make of their implanted powers. Their faculties at first are feeble, but capable of gradual en∣largement, and their enlargement in a great measure de∣pends on themselves. Neither perfection nor happiness, is communicated to us independent of our own choice and conduct, but in connection therewith, and in conse∣quence thereof, and as a reward therefor. And as this is the way that GOD hath chosen to communicate happiness, and we have good reason to believe, that he saw it the fittest and best way, and being so it was not possible for him, acting morally, or as an intelligent wise agent, to communicate it any other way. And I think this appears to an attentive mind, the fittest method of communicat∣ing good to reasonable moral beings. And this reason∣ing holds good with regard to all ranks of moral agents. In the scriptures we read of Angels which sinned, and of Angels which kept not their first estate; which supposes they were not made happy independent of their own vir∣tuous conduct, but were made as men are, capable of happiness but liable to voluntary self corruption. And all ranks of moral beings must be created so, if this was most wise, and fit, and we have good reason to think it was so. It does not seem meet and fit, that happiness should be conferred on moral intelligent beings; until they have gone through some state of trial, wherein they have made the happiness proper to their natures their own choice.</P>
<P>This is certainly consonent to the notions we most rea∣dily and naturally form of right and fit. And doubtless it did appear to the infinite and supreme mind, to be the fittest way to communicate happiness to moral beings; and if this was the real truth, it could not be within the moral power of the Deity, to have created free agents, and put them at once, without previous trial or improve∣ment, in a state of full perfection, and confirmed happi∣ness. And if so they could not have been made impec∣cable. As to the third and last way possible to prevent moral defection, viz, by Deity's interposing at all times, as occasion should require, to keep free agents from mis∣using their liberty. And this looks like a moral impos∣sibility,
<PB N="53" REF="026990_0052_0FD2B516615BE2F0"/>
as utterly unfit; in the reason of things, not being suited to the nature of such kind of beings. Such a kind of government is well suited to the unintelligent part of the creation, but unsuitable for moral agents, as it renders their moral agency wholly useless and and leaves no room for virtue, destroys the moral gov∣ernment of the Deity, and leaves no difference between them, and mere inanimate beings as to the Deity's exer∣cising rule over them. And why then should such pow∣ers and abilities be given men, if they were by the inter∣position of the Deity thus tendered useless? These things considered, I think it not too much for us to say that GOD could not possibly prevent sin; since it appears fit that moral agents should have a place in the scale of be∣ings, and this must be with powers so imperfect as to import a possibility of their erring, without interpositions of the Deity to prevent it: which interpositions, could not consist with wise and fit conduct, because in true construction they would destroy the very notion of free agency, and with it all foundation for any distinction between moral right and wrong.</P>
<P>These thoughts accrued to my mind, long since; when studying how to reconcile, the being of sin in the world, with the wisdom and goodness of GOD, and were a relief to me, when I knew not as any other person ever thought in such a track. But upon consulting an∣tiquity I found several among the ancients, who in their writing have suggested nearly the same thoughts. Among moderns Dr. <HI>Chauncy</HI> on the benevolence of the Deity is the best I have read, on the subject; I am much behol∣den to him for that ingenious work. And when Mr. R. shall have considered this subject a little more, he may be less certain that GOD could prevent sin, or that it does belong to the divine plan.</P>
<P>In p. 40, Mr. R. says,
<Q>Will the objector insist, that sin in event was not comprehended in the divine plan. And that GOD meant, every way as much as possible, to guard against and prevent such an effect?</Q>
Reply, surely I will insist upon this. But I cannot admit your consequences, when you say,
<Q>He may as well say there
<PB N="54" REF="026990_0053_0FD2B4EB542BA688"/>
was no plan, and there is no divine disposal; and de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y there is any such thing as moral evil in the system.</Q>
Gentlemen who undertake to correct the mistakes of oth∣ers, certainly ought to exhibit, close, clear and con∣clusive reasoning, upon true and well disposed premises. But I am mistaken if Mr. R. has done this here, I call upon him to show, if he can how these consequences fol∣low from saying that sin does not belong to GOD's plan. I am sorry any thing so crude and indigested, should drop from the pen of a Clergyman.</P>
<P><Q>OBJ. 2. According to what hath been advanced it is necessary that some should be hardened to their des∣truction. If so liberty is destroyed; men are mere machines; and there can be no reason to impute guilt and blame to them.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. R. allows, a necessity of being hardened but says 'tis
<Q>a necessity of a moral kind—a certainty: yet this is no such necessity as is opposed to liberty. It is necessary GOD should act in a holy manner; yet he acts with the most perfect freedom. And there is a certain∣ty that the glorified saints will be holy and happy forev∣er; by which their liberty, their moral agency will not be destroyed or infringed; but confirmed and exalted.</Q>
What an attempt is here to reconcile the liberty of men in a state of trial with necessity!</P>
<P>I would ask Mr. R. whether GOD is in a state of trial, or can be tempted to do evil? Surely this is the case with men. And as to what he says of glorified saints it is openly false; for if they are now in a confirmed state of holiness they have lost their liberty, which they had in their state of trial; when they were not confirmed in ho∣liness. I am ashamed, that such reasoning, if it may be called reasoning; should drop from the pen of a gentle∣man of Mr. R's character. But unlucky for the good gentleman he proposed objections, to his scheme, that never can be answered. And to me it is wonderful that he did not see that this objection was unanswerable. But we shall find upon examination, that this is truly the case with every objection, that they cannot be answered upon his principles; The first part of the objection respects
<PB N="55" REF="026990_0054_0FD2B5192290A5E8"/>
the destruction of liberty; and Mr. R. has done noth∣ing to remove it. But before I pass to another objec∣tion, I will attend to what he has to say to the other part of the objection, viz,
<Q>Men are mere machines; and there can be no reason to impute guilt and blame to them.</Q>
Mr. R. in reply says,
<Q>Men are not machined, for they move and act of choice, whereas in a mere machine there is no volition.</Q></P>
<P>But why did not Mr. R. consider, that the cattle on a thousand hills act of choice as well as men? Mr. R. tells us,
<Q>If there is no liberty, and moral agency men are not to blame.</Q>
But all the liberty he allows men is liberty of choice, if this makes them moral agents, all the fishes in the sea are moral agents. Mr. R. insists upon it that,
<Q>Sinners are not compelled to do wickedly; and because they act voluntarily they are to blame, are wholly without excuse.</Q>
But is it not a truth, and plain to the understanding of every man, except Mr. R. that, that which maketh a man sin by way of necessity, with and not against his will, is the cause of his sin in a worse manner, than that which constraineth him to sin against his will? I think it will be granted by all men, that he who by wicked art, draweth a man to stab, hang, or poison himself, is in a grosser manner the cause of that evil action, then he that by force compelleth him, because he maketh him to consent to his own death. Now if GOD's decrees do not only make men sin, but sin willing∣ly too; not only cause that they shall do evil, but will evil; GOD hath a deeper hand in men's sins, than if he forced them against their wills. It is in vain therefore for Mr. R. to say,
<Q>Sinners are not compelled to do wickedly,</Q>
for according to him they are much worse than compelled. He tells us that GOD has decreed sin, that his providence orders the occasion; and he at the same time withholds that influence necessary to pre∣vent sin, so that the sinner is under a necessity of fining, and in order to make him guilty, he is by the arts of providence necessitated to will fin! This doctrine makes the sinners condition very sad; but it is most dishonorable to Almighty GOD. We now see, that Mr.
<PB N="56" REF="026990_0055_0FD2B4ED8993C840"/>
R. by attempting to remove this objection, has only made bad, worse.</P>
<P><Q>OBJ. 3. The sentence, whom he will he hardeneth, as it hath been stated, implies a denial of the divine holiness. For the moral law is a transcript of the di∣vine perfections; discovers the heart the will and plea∣sure of the Deity. He there forbids sin upon pain of eternal displeasure, and represents it to be that abomi∣nable thing which his soul abhors. But if sin was com∣prehended in his plan and disposal of things, it must be agreeable to his mind that sin should take place. And it is false to say, he is of purer eyes than to behold ini∣quity: for he must according to this doctrine; behold it with complacency rather than abhorrence; because it is his choice and the consequence of his disposals.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. R. allows, that if the sentiment advanced doth really imply a denial, of any repugnancy to the holiness of the Deity it ought to be rejected. And further he al∣lows that sin is diametrically opposite to holiness, is what GOD must necessarily hate with perfect detestation. But insists upon it, there is no denial of holiness in saying GOD wills the event. To clear this he proposes a dis∣tinction to be considered, p. 45.
<Q>A distinction is to made between GOD's preceptive, and decretive provi∣dential will. The Bible teaches us to make such a dis∣tinction. And it is necessary to reconcile what other∣wise might appear to be irreconcilable. A distinction of this kind is evidently implied in what is said, respec∣ting the conduct of Joseph's brethren, in selling him to the Ishmaelites—in what is said respecting the king of Assyria—and the part the Jews acted in the crucifixion of Christ. Now were sin in event as contrary to the decretive and providential, as sin itself is to the precep∣tive will of GOD, we may be sure it never would take place, on supposition there was a possibility of prevent∣ing it. And to say there was no possibility is to limit the divine power. But GOD certainly could prevent it, if no other way, by withholding existance. And this he no doubt would do rather than sin should take place, were sin in event, as contrary to his providen∣tial as to his preceptive will.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="026990_0056_0FD2B51A5E4056C8"/>On reading what has been said above, Mr. R. may think, that it is no limitation of the divine power to say, that GOD could not possibly prevent sin: and be less confident that if he could do it no other way, he would by withholding existence. But in order to set the mat∣ter now before me in a clear light, it seems necessary to look a little into the distinction, which Mr. R. says is necessary to be made; between GOD's preceptive and his decretive providential will. And likewise into the meaning of sin in <HI>event,</HI> as distinguished from sin <HI>itself.</HI> And then bring up to view, the sentence, whom he will he hardeneth, as it hath been stated by Mr. R. and see whether there is in it any opposition to the holiness of the Deity. I am sorry that Mr. R. has not plainly told us what he means by these terms, then we should not be liable to mistake him. However it is likely, he will agree with the Assembly of Divines, that by the decree of GOD is to be understood, his eternal purpose, accor∣ding to the counsel of his own will, whereby for his own glory he foreordains whatsoever comes to pass. As to GOD's providential will, it is likely he means, the con∣stant, wise, regular, powerful government of the world by GOD. By the preceptive will of GOD, he may un∣derstand, those commands, laws and rules GOD has given to men, in his word. As to the distinction, between sin in <HI>event</HI> and <HI>sin itself,</HI> I am at a loss, respecting Mr. R's meaning; but I will venture to suppose, that by sin itself, he means the sinful action, which the law forbids, and so is against the preceptive will of GOD the lawgiver. And by sin in event the result or issue of the sinful action.</P>
<P>As to the sentence, whom he will he hardeneth, Mr. R. often tells us what it means, particularly, p. 15.
<Q>The great question is what are we to understand by, whom he will he hardeneth? or in what sense may it be truly said that GOD hardeneth any man? This is a tremend∣ously delicate subject.—And there seemeth to be dan∣ger on both hands; so that by steering beyond the proper point to avoid Scylla, we may fall into Charyb∣dis. And this I apprehend we shall do. If on one
<PB N="58" REF="026990_0057_0FD2B4EF34416930"/>
hand, we wholly deny any interposition and divine dis∣posal in respect to the taking place of sin, and a con∣tinued series—a confirmed state in wickedness, ending in eternal ruin and destruction. p. 16. since GOD hard∣eneth whom he will, it is certain his will, in some sense must be concerned in hardening men; and the active verb hardeneth doth import some divine agency and dis∣posal, so that without flat contradiction to the plainest assertion of the pen of inspiration, we cannot wholly ex∣clude the will and agency of GOD.</Q></P>
<P>After a long discourse of several pages; in order to make out, that the event called sin, may not require the same agency of GOD for the production of it, as the effect call∣ed holiness, in p. 19. he comes to this conclusion.
<Q>To sum up the whole, I think it more safe, and doth better accord with the scriptures to say, that GOD orders the occasion, and for wise and important ends doth not interpose that influence, which in the given circumstan∣ces would be necessary to prevent sin and impenitence; than that he causes sin and impenitence by his own posi∣tive and immediate energy.</Q>
According to Mr. R. sin, and impenitence in sin, and the eternal ruin and des∣truction of sinners, is the effect of the will and agency of GOD. And to deny this, is to contradict the plainest assertion of the pen of inspiration. The reader will here take notice, how Mr. R's mistaking the meaning of the scripture he predicated his discourse upon, has unhappi∣ly lead him into this blasphemous opinion. But to sof∣ten the matter a little, he is willing we should think, that GOD does not cause sin and impenitence by his own posi∣tive and immediate energy; but by his providence or∣ders the occasion, at the same time withholds that influ∣ence, which in the given circumstances would be neces∣sary to prevent sin and impenitence. But does this at all help the matter? Is it not true, that he that withholds light causes darkness? Is it not true, that he that with∣holdeth a thing, which being present would hinder an event, is the sole cause of the event? As he that with∣holds a pillar which should support a house, is the true cause of the falling of that house. So GOD by withhhol∣ding
<PB N="59" REF="026990_0058_0FD2B51BC6936538"/>
necessary influence from men, is the true cause of their sin. It will not help the matter at all to say that GOD by withholding necessary influence, becomes only an accidental, not a direct cause of men's sins. For a cause is then only accidental in relation to the effect, when the effect is beside the intention &amp; expectation of the cause.</P>
<P>As digging in a field is then an accidental cause of fin∣ding a bag of gold, when that event is not intended or expected by the husbandman in digging. But when the event is looked for and aimed at, the cause (though it be the cause only by withholding) is not accidental, as a pilot who withholdeth his care and skill from a ship in a storm, foreseeing that by his neglect the ship will be lost, is not to be reputed an accidental, but a direct cause of the loss of that ship. Hence, if it be true as Mr. R. tells us, that GOD hath decreed sin in event, and by his providence orders the occasion, he at the same time withholding nece∣ssary influence to prevent sin, not being ignorant of what will follow, but knowing it infallibly, determining precisely that which doth follow, namely the impenitence and dam∣nation of sinners, becometh the proper and direct cause of their sins and their damnation.</P>
<P>That Mr. R. had quite as good affirm that GOD cau∣ses sin and impenitence, by his own positive and imme∣diate energy. Mr. R. tells us that a distinction is to be made, between GOD's preceptive, and decretive provi∣dential will; that such a distinction is necessary in order to reconcile what otherwise might appear to be irrecon∣cilable. But he has not applied it, and I know not how to do it. And for my life I cannot see, either any ground for the distinction, or any help it can possibly af∣ford. And I do hereby call upon Mr. R. to explain himself fully upon this head.</P>
<P>Mr. R. tells us,
<Q>that whatsoever takes place through the system, from beginning to end, takes place in con∣sistence with the decretive and providential will of GOD; but sin takes place in perfect opposition to his precep∣tive will.</Q>
But he denies that the decree is repugnant to the command. I will try to illustrate this matter by what is recorded of David, 2 Sam. xi chap. I have al∣ready
<PB N="60" REF="026990_0059_0FD2B4F43AF89E60"/>
observed that if I understand Mr. R. by what he calls sin in event, and which he says is agreeable to the decretive and providential will of GOD; he means the result or issue of a wicked action. Now the result of David's act of adultery with the wife of Uriah, was that she was with child. This event of David's sin made a part of the divine plan, was what GOD purposed accor∣ding to the counsel of his will and foreordained should be. And as GOD's decrees are powerful and active, his counsel stands and his pleasure is done in heaven and on earth, providence therefore we may be sure, will bring into event whatever GOD has decreed shall be. Accor∣dingly in this case providence orders the occasion; Da∣vid from the roof of his house, sees the woman, is struck with her beauty, enquires her out, sends for her, and when they come together that the eternal decree and purpose of GOD might not be frustrated; GOD withholds from them both, that influence, which under these circumstances, was necessary to prevent Adultery. Accordingly David lay with her, and she proving with child, the eternal de∣cree and purpose of GOD was fulfilled, the end of his pro∣vidence answered, and his will done, and David's prayers, if he prayed that the will of GOD might be done, were now most happily answered. But there is a precept for∣bidding this, under the name of Adultery, and threaten∣ing death to the Adulterer; what shall we do with this? The will of GOD decreeing the event, and ordering such a concurrence of circumstances, as to render the action necessary to the event eligible, and at the same time with∣holding necessary help against temptation, seems not to agree with his forbidding the action, and under a severe penalty too. It is wonderful to me, that when Mr. R. was making this discourse, he did not advert to what the Apostle says, 1 Cor. x. 13. GOD is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able; but will with the temptation also, make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. I hope those whose minds may be filled with horror and despair, on viewing the character Mr. R. gives of our heavenly father, will ad∣vert hereto and be comforted under all trials.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="026990_0060_0FD2B51D42A9D6C8"/>Mr. R. tells us p. 46.
<Q>It doth not follow, that the decree is in opposition to the command—it doth not follow, that GOD's will in the former case, opposes his will in the latter—it doth not follow that GOD hath two wills, thwarting each other. Were there a real op∣position, insisting on the distinction would run us into the Manichean heresy, or what would be as gross. And would even amount to a denial of divine existence.</Q>
What is there no opposition between the will of GOD, de∣creeing sin, ordering the occasion for it, and withhold∣ing from men that influence necessary to avoid it, and his will forbiding of it? Does not GOD's will decreeing and ordering sin oppose his will in forbiding of it? Doth it not follow that GOD hath two wills, thwarting each other, when he decrees sin and by his all powerful providence renders it inevitable, and yet in his law forbids it on pain of death? If GOD's will in all this is perfectly concor∣dant, as Mr. R. tells us it is; I would pray him to tell us what does constitute opposition, or occasion things to thwart each other. I would pray Mr. R. to consider how he will make it appear that David and Uriah's wife sinned at all, since what they did was but fulfiling GOD's decree, and complying with his providence, and as to them inevitable, they having no power to do otherwise, or forbare doing as they did. Mr. R. has told us what he will say to this, p. 43.
<Q>And because they act volun∣tarily, respecting that which is evil and make the evil their own, they are to blame, are wholly without ex∣cuse.</Q>
But surely they were not more to blame or in∣excusable than Balaam's ass was for falling down under him. Sin has ever been considered by men, the will to do that from which we have freedom to abstain. But David and Uriah's wife had not that influence which was necessary to prevent their doing just as they did, and consequently necessary for them to do as they did, as necessary as for Balaam's ass to turn out of the way and at last to fall under him, and as she was beat most unjustly, so, according to Mr. R. to blame David and Uriah's wife for what they did would be most unjust. They cer∣tainly wanted nothing but a righteous Judge and they
<PB N="62" REF="026990_0061_0FD2B4F795F6C1C8"/>
would be acquitted as well as the poor ass; unless men have hitherto been mistaken about what sin is. Mr. R. tells us p. 46.
<Q>Sin is considered by GOD, in his decree and providence relative to it, as being perfectly evil and hateful. And as such by him to be opposed.</Q></P>
<P>Such a sentence as this, to fall from the lips of a gen∣tleman of Mr. R's sentiments, is most wonderful! If this be true, then when GOD willed to decree sin he hated to will it, or willed what he hated! i. e. Choose what he did not choose! And he must necessarily hate his own decree, and his own providence that brings it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto event, yea, he must necessarily look upon his own decree and providence respecting sin, not only as being perfectly evil and hateful, but as what by him is to be constantly opposed! Mr. R. tells us, p. 45.
<Q>Whatsoever takes place through the system, from beginning to end, takes place in consistence with the decretive and providen∣tial will of GOD; but sin takes place in perfect op∣position to his preceptive will.</Q>
In this sentence these three things are expressed. 1. That sin does take place. 2. That it is agreeable to the decretive and providential will of GOD that it should. 3. That it is yet in perfect opposition to his preceptive will. If this does not make out two wills in GOD, continually thwarting each other, I think no words can do it. Mr. R. tells us p. 46.
<Q>That while the exercise of one and the same will of the Deity is distinguished, it is and may appear, even to our un∣derstandings, perfectly harmonious.</Q>
Reply, It may ap∣pear so to Mr. R's understanding, but certainly it does not to mine. How a will exercised in bringing into e∣vent opposites, as sin and holiness, can be hermonious, is to me inconceivable. The harmony of the will exercised upon opposites, must either destroy the op∣position, or the opposition must destroy the harmo∣ny. If the will of GOD decreeing that Uriah's wife should be with child by David, is perfectly harmonious with his will forbidding adultery, then when Uriah's wife was with child by David according to the decretive and providential will of GOD, they could not be condemned by the precept forbidding adultery, nor could there be any reason for GOD's being displeased with David, for the
<PB N="63" REF="026990_0062_0FD2B51EECE42830"/>
thing that he had done. For this would at once destroy the harmony of the divine will, exercised in decreeing events and in giving laws; and clearly show that they were opposite and did thwart each other. Mr. R. must now give up his distinction or run himself into something more gross, than the mistake of Manes. In p. 47. Mr. R. supposes, as well he might, that some would ask,
<Q>Why may not GOD command his creatures to sin with a view to his own glory, and the advancement of holi∣ness, as well as decree sin in event with such a view? (to which he answers) To all that can be urged in such a line, this will be a sufficient rejoinder. That Paul has obviated and repelled with indignation a similar in∣sinuation, as if it were a just consequence from the doctrine he had advanced, see Rom. iii. 7, 8.</Q>
But Mr. R. ought to consider, that there is no similarity be∣tween the subject Paul was discoursing and the subject of his discourse. And although the objection the Apostle supposes the Jews would make against his doctrine was without foundation, yet the objection against Mr. R's. doctrine is well founded, and could he have answered it, I think he would not have made use of such a mean eva∣sion. Upon the whole, the objection as stated by Mr. R. stands in full force against his scheme, not only as it implies a denial of the divine holiness, but as it most evi∣dently makes GOD the only sinner in the universe. And what he has said under the objection and to remove it, really makes the matter much worse, than otherwise it would have been. I have therefore his consent for re∣jecting the sentence, whom he will he hardeneth, as stat∣ed by him.</P>
<P><Q>OBJ. 4. If GOD hath mercy on whom he will, and hardeneth whom he will, in the sense that hath been stat∣ed he is the most tyrannical being in the universe. For it represents him as exercising an odious partiality in his treatment of his creatures, as making a multitude of ra∣tional beings on purpose to damn them. And as acting manifest injustice and cruelty in his disposal of things.</Q></P>
<P>To this Mr. R. replies, 1st, by shewing that sovereign∣ty and tyranny are not the same. That although GOD is
<PB N="64" REF="026990_0063_0FD2B4F894923470"/>
a sovereign, it doth not follow that he is tyrant. But Mr. R. tells us that God withholds that influence from men, in the hour of trial, which is necessary to prevent sin, who yet forbids it on pain of death. Now what makes a tyrant if requiring brick without straw does not? 2d. Mr. R. tells us that,
<Q>In making one man unto honor and another unto dishonor, there is not the shadow of in∣justice. This might be urged with good reason if God had, or should devote men to, destruction without any consideration of their demerits.</Q></P>
<P>Let it be remembered here, that according to Mr. R. GOD not only decrees sin, but by his powerful provi∣dence orders the occasion, at the same time withholding from men necessary help against sin; so that it becomes absolutely impossible, that men should do otherwise than they do. Now is it not a plain case, that sin is an action from which the sinner might abstain. But according to Mr. R. men can do no otherwise than they do; why then does he talk about demerit? According to him it is impossible there can be any such thing. Three things are necessary to make an action culpable. 1. That it be in our power to do or forbear it. 2. That we be obliged to do or forbear it. 3. That we omit what we ought to have done, or do what we ought not to have done.</P>
<P>If a tyrant should require me to tell whether the plan∣et Jupiter is inhabited or not, or to fly to the moon, as one is above my intellectual faculty to discover, and the other above my active faculty to perform; neither of them can be my duty. And to neglect them cannot be my sin. According to Mr. R. those whom GOD har∣dens have no sin, and if damned as he says they will be; though they will be most cruelly treated, yet they will surely have a good conscience, and be eternally assured that could they but have a righteous judge, they should be honourably acquitted.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mr. R. tells us,
<Q>No cruelty will be exercised. GOD will certainly inflict endless punishment upon finally impenitent sinners; yet he doth not delight in the death of sinners.</Q>
Reply, is it not cruel to inflict
<PB N="65" REF="026990_0064_0FD2B524D0B154A8"/>
endless punishment on men, for neglecting what they never could do; or doing what they never could avoid? And does not he delight in the death of men, who damn's them for nothing but his pleasure?</P>
<P N="4">4. Mr. R. tells us p. 50 that,
<Q>Hardening some, and saving others doth not make GOD to be a respector of persons, in the sense the scrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saith he is no res∣pector of persons. The sentiment advanced is not de∣nied by saying, in every nation he that feareth GOD, and worketh righteousness is accepted of him: Because it is true, that they in every nation on whom GOD hath mercy do, or will fear him, and work righteousness.</Q>
Reply, the sentiment advanced by Mr. R. is that the ex∣ercise of mercy is wholly resolved into the will and sov∣ereign pleasure of the Deity, see p. 10. The saying re∣fered to, makes the fearing God, and working righteous∣ness the ground of acceptance. The sentiment is there∣fore denied by the saying. No says Mr. R. for
<Q>In every nation they on whom GOD hath mercy do, or will fear him and work righteousness.</Q>
Then they are not ac∣cepted because they f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> GOD and work righteousness as the saying affirms, but they fear GOD and work righteous∣ness because they are accepted! How vain is it for Mr. R. to try to reconcile his sentiments with scripture. The reader now sees, that the objection is not in the least weakened by any thing that Mr. R. has said, but stands in full force against him.</P>
<P><Q>OBJ. 5. The subject, as it hath been stated and defended, makes GOD to act in a trifling insincere manner, and impose upon men in the calls and offers of the gospel. Because he appears to express great kind∣ness and tenderness towards sinners, willing rather that they should turn and live; when he is determined at the same time, to withhold his saving mercy from mul∣titudes, and make them monuments of his eternal wrath. What possible kindness and sincerity can their be in offering salvation to any, except those on whom he will have mercy? And why may it not with propriety be deemed ludicrous to invite and urge all to come? Using language too which carries the appearance of pa∣thos
<PB N="66" REF="026990_0065_0FD2B4FA06612DC0"/>
and zeal, and proceeding so far as to beseech sin∣ners to be reconciled; when by an unfrustrable decree he hath excluded from a share of his saving mercy, it may he the greater part of those to whom he makes the proposal and gives the invitations, so warmly and pa∣thetically urged and enforced? And is determined that they shall be hardened to their eternal destruction.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. R. replies to this by saying,
<Q>GOD is perfectly sincere in the offers he makes and the invitations he gives to sinners. Is as willing all should comply with his calls, as he is, that all should obey him.</Q>
But pray Sir, is GOD willing those should obey him, from whom he withholds that influence necessary to enable them so to do? Is it not tantalizing men to clog the offers he makes them with impossible conditions? Two ways Mr. R. attempts to vindicate the divine sincerity. 1st. by saying,
<Q>It is sufficient to vindicate the divine sincerity, that GOD stands ready to fullfill and bestow what is set forth in the calls and offers he gives and makes, on supposition they are complied with by sin∣ners: For this is clear and certain, whosoever will may come; and him that cometh Christ will in no wise cast out. There is no decree or divine disposal to prevent their coming if they will.</Q>
Here let it be remember∣ed, that Mr. R. affirms a divine decree and disposal re∣specting sin and impenitency therein; and that GOD ac∣tually does withhold from men that influence necessary to prevent sin and impenitency. Now that which disa∣bles a man from choosing good or refusing evil, must de∣stroy his liberty to choose good or refuse evil. But GOD by withholding necessary influence renders men totally unable to choose good or refusing evil, and of course whol∣ly destroys all liberty of will. Hence there is no need of a decree to prevent their coming if they will, for the li∣berty of their wills is already totally destroyed; being determined by GOD's decree, providence and withhold∣ing necessary influence. Will Mr. R. say, that GOD does not take from men the faculty of willing, and there∣fore they are to blame for not choosing good; since they attain the power. This is the same as to say, a Bird re∣tains
<PB N="67" REF="026990_0066_0FD2B526C17E1098"/>
the power of flying when I hold his wings; or that a man chang'd, is free to walk, because he retains the faculty of walking. Mr. R. must remove out of the way his decrees, before he can vindicate the divine sin∣cerity in making offers to men. The calls and offers GOD in his word gives and makes to men, upon Mr. R's principles, appears not a whit better, than it would in me, should I bind a man hand and foot, lock him up in a house, then set fire to it, and ask him, why will you stay there and be burnt? As I live I have no pleasure in your death. Come unto me and you shall not be cast out. But would not such conduct in me be morking and insulting upon the misery of the man? But not more so than gospel offers are upon Mr. R's principles.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Mr. R. attempts to vindicate the divine sincerity by saying as in p. 53.
<Q>There is the same kindness and sincerity as if GOD knew the offers would be most cor∣dially accepted. And his having mercy on some by disposing them to except, is a distinct thing, and super∣added to the calls and offers themselves. Therefore, al∣though it is readily conceded, that much greater kind∣ness is exercised by GOD towards those on whom he hath mercy by making them willing in the day of his power, then towards those who are not made willing: yet this greater mercy is not exercised in the calls that are given, the offers that are made; but in respect to the offers and the arguments used to induce a compliance, there is pre∣cisely the same kindness and sincerity towards all.</Q>
i. e. none at all. For if salvation depends on GOD's having mercy upon a person, and GOD's having mercy on them be a thing distinct from the calls and offers of the gospel; then GOD in the calls and offers of the gospel shews <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o kindness to any, as I can see, The Angels quite mis∣understood the gospel, and give us a very false account of it, when they call it glad tidings of great joy to all people! Mr. R. tells us,
<Q>GOD might be sincere in making the offer to all on supposition none did, and not one ever should accept.</Q>
But your business Sir, is to shew that GOD is sincere in making offers to those he knows never can accept, and whom he has determined never shall accept. Otherwise you do nothing towards answer∣ing
<PB N="68" REF="026990_0067_0FD2B4FB8553D0B8"/>
the objection. Mr. R. says,
<Q>GOD is sincere, serious and earnest in requiring the subjection and obe∣dience of all those who are in a state of unregeneracy; although none in that state do yield a cordial subjection and obedience to his commands, and he knows perfectly well that they will not.</Q>
But does GOD know that they cannot? Has he predetermined that they shall not? Do you mean to grant this in what followeth?
<Q>Also the not doing it, is as much the result of the divine decree and disposal as hardening whom he will to their des∣truction is the result of his decree and disposal.</Q></P>
<P>That the destruction of men is the result of the divine decree and disposal, you have before declared; here you affirm, that the disobedience of men to GOD's commands is as much the result of the divine decree and disposal. But this sir, is what is objected to, and which the ob∣jection says makes GOD to act in a trifling insincere man∣ner in the calls and offers of the gospel. Do therefore reconcile the divine sincerity in the calls and offers of the gospel, with such decrees and disposals, or own that you cannot answer the objection. Your saying that GOD is sincere is not satisfactory to me, I call for proof. You add,
<Q>We may as well say GOD acts sarcastically, and tantalizes his creatures when he requires their subjec∣tion and obedience, they being and remaining indispo∣sed to yield obedience, as that he doth so, when he makes offers, they being indisposed to accept them.</Q>
Very true when creatures disobedience is the result of GOD's decree and disposal, he does tantalize, insult and abuse them by commands, offers &amp;c. as I say; and you offer no proof to the contrary; yet go about to stop my mouth by dint of authority, when you say,
<Q>Who art thou that thus repliest against GOD? let thy mouth be stopped; or surely, thou shalt be most justly condem∣ned.</Q>
This sir, I despise in you, and it convinces me that you felt yourself weak, or you would never take such a method to silence objectors. I do not reply against GOD, but against the false character you ignorantly or wickedly give of the ever glorious GOD. And call upon you to vindicate yourself from the guilt of slandering the
<PB N="69" REF="026990_0068_0FD2B527CAC4D9E8"/>
father of mercies before the world, if you can. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as you have nothing to say for yourself. This objection, therefore like others lies with all its force against you.</P>
<P><Q>OBJ. 6. This is a gloomy uncomfortable doctrine calculated to bad men; especially awakened sinners to despair: or else to stif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le their convictions. The natur∣al tendency of it is to render means and endeavours vain and useless. For if it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runeth: If the unregenerate may not lay any claim to saving mercy after all their most pain∣ful seekings and strivings: If there is a certain num∣ber on whom GOD will have mercy, and a certain num∣ber whom he will harden to their destruction, to what purpose can it be to seek and strive? each sinner may say, if I am to be saved, I shall be saved, and if I am to perish I shall perish, let my exertions be as they may. And since it is not left to men to determine their own character, and ascertain their eternal state, but it hangs on a decree and disposal which they cannot frustrate; let them stand still, and see what GOD means to do, whether to save or damn; and give themselves no exercise and concern about that which doth not be∣long to them; and which to say it doth belong to them implies a denial of GOD's essential, inalienable prero∣gative.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. R. has attempted five answers to this objection, without saying one word that does in the least degree weaken it, but rather establish it; particularly by his fourth answer, which is,
<Q>There is not the least ground from the doctrine to say, if we are to be saved we shall be saved, let us live as we may, and whether we take any pains or not. Because repentance, faith, and obe∣dience are implied in, or will certainly follow the exer∣cise of saving mercy, whenever it is bestowed upon any.</Q></P>
<P>The objection says, since there is a certain number on whom GOD will have mercy and a certain number whom he will harden to their destruction; each sinner may say, if I am to be saved I shall be saved &amp;c.—all exertions are
<PB N="70" REF="026990_0069_0FD2B5004D1CC408"/>
vain, especially since it is not left with men to determine their own character &amp;c.—Mr. R. says, there is no ground for this objection, because repentance, faith, and obedience are implied in, or will certainly follow the ex∣ercise of saving mercy, whenever it is bestowed upon any. Now, according to Mr. R. eternal salvation is connected with GOD's having mercy on any; but GOD's having mercy on any, depends neither in whole nor in part upon any thing done by them, or any state of mind they may be in. Therefore, if faith, repentance, and obedience, do certainly follow GOD's having mercy on any, it is a good reason why sinners should be uncon∣cerned about faith, repentance and obedience, for as these will follow mercy, but not at all further it, there is no reason why sinners should be concerned about them. Every sinner may now say, not only, if I am to be saved I shall be saved, and if I am to perish I shall perish; but if I am to have repentance, faith and obedience. I shall have them, and if I am to remain impenitent, un∣believing and disobedient I shall remain so. That upon Mr. R's scheme, there is not one whit more reason for any man's concerning himself about religion, than about the ebbing and flowing of the tide. All that Mr. R. has done, in his answer to this objection, is to show that sinners have good reason to be unconcerned about the means of salvation as well as about salvation itself I Mr. R. says, he apprehends these objections to be the most considerable that any can advance against his scheme. I do not think so of them. However I have carefully attended the scuffle he has had with them, and find them all standing in as good quality, condition and repair as before he threw a snow-ball at them. And Mr. R. has greatly dishonoured himself, by attempting to answer, that, which upon his plan, is absolutely unanswerable.</P>
<P N="6">6. I come as proposed to make some remarks on Mr. R's improvement of his subject. The improvement be∣gins, p. 57. And is as followeth.</P>
<P N="1">1.
<Q>From what hath been urged and illustrated in the preceeding discourse we may learn the vanity and futil∣ity of the objections, commonly advanced, against the
<PB N="71" REF="026990_0070_0FD2B52958349050"/>
devine decrees. And that decree in particular, where∣by a certain number of mankind were from eternity ordained to everlasting life, called the decree of election. The doctrine of an eternal decree, in a general view, is discarded by many. Barely to mention in eternal irrevocable decree fires their indignation; and more especially to mention and insist upon the decree of elec∣tion. If GOD according to the counsel of his own will from eternity, did choose a certain number in Christ and appoint them to obtain salvation, and pass by the rest; and that number will be saved and the rest per∣ish. Then say they: He must be a hateful respect∣or of persons, one who exercises partiality, injustice and cruelty: Must have a design to make creatures on purpose to damn them, and sport with their misery and destruction: Must be the author of their sin and des∣truction: Events are unalterably fixed beforehand; and being fixed, there can be no liberty in respect to choosing and acting: men are machines, and ought not to be blamed: The old heathenish doctrine of fate is palmed upon the Bible: A great part of mankind have no chance for their lives: And it is as much an vain for men to seek and strive and exert themselves, as it is to attempt to alter immutability itself. In a word, men are chained down by unfrustrable decree; the di∣vine government is an exercise of the most obdious ty∣ranny: and it is not reasonable, nor possible to love a being of such a character. It is in a miserable way of reasoning, that such consequences are drawn, and turn∣ed into objections against the divine decree, in general, and that of election, in particular, they are most not all of them illogical, unfounded, vain and imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. R. has plainly told us his sense of the doctrine of election in these words,
<Q>GOD according to the counsel of his own will from eternity, did choose a certain num∣ber in Christ and appoint them to obtain salvation, and pass by the rest, and that number will be saved, and the rest perish.</Q>
This I suppose to be Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s own sentiment, or that opinion of the decree or election which he means to defend. He denies a conditional election,
<PB N="72" REF="026990_0071_0FD2B501B4789A18"/>
most expressly, p. 39,
<Q>There cannot be any conditio∣nal decree or determination in the divine mind, respec∣ting his having mercy on some and hardening others.</Q>
Mr. R's. opinion then is plainly this, namely, that GOD from eternity choose a certain number in Christ, whom he by an absolute decree appointed to salvation; who shall all infallibly be saved, all the rest be passed by, or left; and they shall infallibly perish. That salvation was from eternity as certain to all chosen, and damna∣tion as certain from eternity to all passed by, as GOD could make any thing.</P>
<P>I shall now undertake to show that all the consequen∣ces mentioned by Mr. R. as drawn from the decree of election, do necessarily follow from his own opinion of that doctrine as here set down by him. And in doing this, I will take them separately as they follow.</P>
<P N="1"><Q>1. Then GOD must be a hateful respector of per∣sons.</Q>
That GOD is the judge of all the earth. That he has given his reasonable creatures a law, or rule of duty: and required them to obey his commands, promi∣sing rewards to the obedient, and threatening punishment to the disobedient. And has bound himself to deter∣mine their character, reward and punish them according as they shall be found, keepers or transgressors of the law, that they are under. These are things which I suppose need no proof. But Mr. R. tells us, that GOD from eternity did choose some in Christ and appoint them to obtain salvation, leaving the rest to perish. But is this according to law? He further tells us,
<Q>There is a most wide and important difference in the exercise of saving mercy, it is not bestowed upon all mankind; but upon some only even those upon whom GOD is pleased to bestow it.</Q></P>
<P>Now if men's characters are determined and eternal state fixed according to the pleasure of the judge; the law is not the rule. But if a judge favours one and frowns upon, another according to his own pleasure, is he not partial? Why were some chosen, when others were pas∣sed by? all were equally near, equally needy, and equal∣ly deserving or undeserving. Why then were some pas∣sed
<PB N="73" REF="026990_0072_0FD2B52B587F87B8"/>
by and left to perish? Mr. R. tells us it was the plea∣sure of GOD. But does not this to all intents make GOD a respecter of persons? Mr. R. tells us p. 13, that,
<Q>No situation—external circumstances, or even state of mind persons may be in antecedently to regeneration, ought to be considered as having the least influence in the divine determination, respecting the bestowment of his saving mercy.</Q>
Reply, if the objects of saving mercy were chosen from eternity and appointed to sal∣vation, as Mr. R. tells us; I can easily believe, that re∣penting, confessing and forsaking sin, or any seeking or striving of sinners, will have no influence on the divine mind to bestow mercy on any. But what does influence GOD to choose some of his children to be happy and leave others to be miserable? Their circumstances were exactly alike, and for a judge to favour one and frown upon another, when in equal circumstances is to have respect to persons; and what makes it hateful, is that it is contrary to equity. GOD as benefactor, may give five talents to one and but two to another, without wrong to any; but as a judge he has bound himself to do right. But to reward some with life and punish others with death, who are in equal circumstances, must make him a hate∣ful respecter of persons.</P>
<P>Mr. R. p. 51, proposes the case of a person,
<Q>Ha∣ving an estate and no natural heir, (who he says) might select one, or a few just as he should please, on whom to confer his estate, and no one would have a right to tax him with being a respecter of persons, because he did not bequeath it to all without discrimination. And if such a prerogative is allowed to men, in respect to what they possess and call their own, shall not GOD bestow his special favours on whom he pleases, without the imputation of being an odious respecter of persons?</Q>
Reply, if the person holding the estate, requires of all, something to be done, in order to their inheriting his estate, and he gives the necessary aid to some to do what he requires, and withholds it from others, in like cir∣cumstances he is an odious respecter of persons. And such a one Mr. R. makes the ever glorious GOD to be,
<PB N="74" REF="026990_0073_0FD2B50308AF4C10"/>
p. 12, 'And where there is a similarity of circumstances, it is probable, some are saved, others not.'</P>
<P>According to Mr. R. those that are saved are not one whit better or more deserving than those that perish. They were alike in eternity when the decree was made; and as to any difference in time, according to him it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wholly effected by a supernatural influence, in which they have no hand, as it is quite above their agency, and for which they are none the better. That respect to per∣sons is the sole cause of the original choice and all suc∣ceeding favours.</P>
<P>The excellent Bishop Hoadly, on terms of acceptance with GOD, p. 302, has this true observation,
<Q>If virtue be nothing but the irresistable operation of GOD upon us, there can be no reason in the world assign'd why GOD should hate and punish a wicked man and love and reward another: because as to themselves they are exactly alike. The only difference here supposed is this, that GOD is pleased after an arbitrary manner, to work upon one: and wholly to pass by the other. If any parent should heap his favours upon one child, and then show the greatest fondness to him, merely be∣cause those favours have been heaped upon him, and absolutely refuse to bestow the least degree of the same upon another of his children, and yet hate and punish him because he had not what he could not have without his will; would not all the world condemn such a par∣ent of the most partial fondness, and the most arbitra∣ry proceeding; and attribute it to nothing but weak∣ness of understanding, or strength of passion? And yet this is what we are not afraid to lay upon Almighty GOD, when we represent him as doing all for some, with an irresistable arm, and then loving them for what they have no part in, and on the other side, as passing by others, and refusing them the same strength without which they cannot move, and yet hateing and condem∣ning them for not being what they cannot be, and not doing what they cannot do.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. 'Then GOD is partial, unjust and cruel.' And is not GOD more favourable to those of his offspring that he
<PB N="75" REF="026990_0074_0FD29689F2646400"/>
choose, than to those of them that he passed by? And what is this but partiality? And what is it but open barefaced injustice to treat thus differently persons in equal circumstances? And what inexpressible cruelty is discovered towards those passed by? A cruelty which the Devil never can be justly charged with, for though he seeks to destroy men, yet they are not his children, but we are the offspring of GOD.</P>
<P N="3"><Q>3. Then GOD must have a design to make creatures on purpose to damn them.</Q>
Will you say, GOD de∣signed to save those he from eternity passed by? And if he did not design to save them, for what did he call them into being? I know you tell us, that GOD by the entrance of sin designed, to display his justice in puni∣shing some, and his mercy in saving others, see p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and 27. For your GOD it seems is equally made up of free grace and free wrath, and so contrives to bring in sin in order to make himself known to his creatures! But pray consider how you blaspheme your maker, while you suppose his decree to make it necessary for his sub∣jects, to trade with hell and Satan for sin and damnation, to the end he may take advantage out of that commerce to raise an impost, to augment the revenues of his own glory. A meanness this, which none but tyrants and bankrupts would ever stoop to!</P>
<P N="4"><Q>4. Then GOD must be the author of their sin and destruction.</Q>
Those that GOD passed by, you allow must perish, now that sin may seem to be the cause of their destruction, GOD withholds from them necessary influence to prevent sin; and so as I have shown, be∣comes the cause, author and even the doe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of all the wickedness that is in the world. And if any are des∣troyed by sin GOD is the author of their destruction, ac∣cording to you.</P>
<P N="5">5. 'Events are unalterably fixed before hand.' From eternity you tell us they were, which was before crea∣tures existed, and so beforehand, as to them. Surely you will not pretend, that any of those GOD choose will perish: or any be passed by be saved; indeed you say the contrary.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="76" REF="026990_0075_0FD2B50484611418"/>
<Q>6. There can be no liberty in respect to choosing and acting.</Q>
If as you say, GOD chose some and pas∣sed by others from eternity, 'tis impossible for men to choose or act, with regard to their future state; being quite as destitute of liberty as a stone.</P>
<P N="7"><Q>7. Then men are machines, and ought not to be blamed.</Q>
You deny to man a self determining power with regard to his volitions. Now as this is the basis of moral obligation; to talk of moral agency, unless this be first supposed, is to contradict common sense. We might it is true, without the implantation of such a pow∣er, in our natures, in consequence of a chain of exterior causes, not within the reach of our controul, be made instruments in the production of any effects which are unavoidably connected with their chain of fatality, should even volition or choice be one of its links. But free agents we could not be, and it could never with truth be affirmed of us that we were the producers of these ef∣fects. Mr. R's decree of election, totally destroys mor∣al agency, and makes all men machines respecting the world to come. True we may be distinguished from windmills, carts and ploughs, because conscious and voluntary, whereas they are not. But there is an essen∣tial difference between conscious voluntary machines and agents. An agent must be the efficient cause of his own volitions and actions. But such we are not, if there be such a decree as Mr. R. tells of; and therefore at best but machines, and consequently ought not to be bla∣med.</P>
<P N="8"><Q>8. The old heathen doctrine of fate is palmed upon the Bible.</Q>
Some among the Pagan philosophers, in former ages thought, that all effects take rise from a chain of causes, with the Deity at its head as the only efficient, so unavoidably linked together, connected with, and dependent on each other, that the coming of these effects into event, in consequence of the unavoidable operation of these causes, was not only certain, but absolutely inevitable. And they considered mankind, with all their powers, as so many links in the adamantine chain, no one of which can possibly fail in the produc∣tion
<PB N="77" REF="026990_0076_0FD2B52DDF21F498"/>
of the effect assigned to it. This is the old heathen∣ish doctrine of fate. And the very doctrine which Mr. R. labours to palm upon the Bible, under the name of the decree of election, with regard to sin, he affirms a di∣vine decree and disposal, and a continued series, a con∣firmed state in wickedness, ending in eternal ruin and destruction. p. 16.</P>
<P N="9"><Q>9. A great part of mankind have no chance for their lives.</Q>
You tell us, that all those passed by will per∣ish, surely they have no chance for their lives, whose destruction was made certain from eternity by GOD's pas∣sing them by.</P>
<P N="10"><Q>10. As vain to strive as to attempt to alter immutabi∣lity itself.</Q>
If GOD's decrees are immutable, as you tell 'us they be, the consequence is necessary.</P>
<P N="11">11. 'Men are chained down by unfrustable decrees.' If GOD has decreed as you tell us, and his decrees are unfrustable; the consequence is necessary.</P>
<P N="12"><Q>12. The divine government is an exercise of the most odious tyranny.</Q>
Most evidently true, if your de∣cree of election is true.</P>
<P N="13"><Q>13. not reasonable nor possible to love a Being of such a character.</Q>
As to those passed by, you tell us they will be 'eternal enemies of GOD;' and with good reason, his character being as you give it. And as to those chosen, whatever good they may receive from such a being, they can never love, but must eternally hate his character, because destitute of equity, justice, truth right∣eousness and mercy.</P>
<P>I will now by the same 'miserable way of reasoning,' that the foregoing consequences are drawn, mention some more that dog your decree of election.</P>
<P>If GOD did from eternity choose a certain number in Christ, and appoint them to obtain salvation, and pass by the rest; and that number will be saved, and the rest perish.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then the Bible does not give us the character of the true GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then Jesus Christ is falsly called the Saviour of the world.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="78" REF="026990_0077_0FD2B506030A9850"/>3. Then it is false to say that Christ marvelled at the unbelief of the Jews.</P>
<P N="4">4. Then the preaching of the gospel is one of the most absurd, wicked, and barbarous things in the world.</P>
<P N="5">5. Then the present state of men in this world is not a state of trial.</P>
<P N="6">6. Then men are not subjects of Law nor concerned in a Judgment to come.</P>
<P N="7">7. Then all care in men about their eternal condition is vain and foolish.</P>
<P N="8">8. Then
<Q>the work of redemption by Christ hath (not) opened the way to prevent the eternal destruction of the human kind,</Q>
as you tell us it has, p. 35.</P>
<P N="9">9. Then ministers might as well be sent to preach to stones as to men.</P>
<P N="10">10. Then the testimony of the Apostles unto the Gos∣pel is false.</P>
<P N="11">11. Then all exhortations to men to work out their own salvation are vain.</P>
<P N="12">12. Then no sin that men can commit is damning.</P>
<P N="13">13. Then the Devil is a fool to go about like a roar∣ing lion seeking whom he may devour. These conse∣quences added to those mentioned by you will make, twenty-six in number. And now Sir, I call upon you, with all your Logical and metaphysical skill, to show one of them to be illogical, unfounded, vain and impious; if you can: which when you shall have done, I will hold myself obliged publickly to acknowledge my mistake. But here is something that at a distance looks like reasoning, in page 58. I must take notice of that as I pass a long.
<Q>If the divine providence can be vindi∣cated, in respect to things taking place as they do in fact take place, a divine decree pre-ordaining the taking place of things as they do take place, will be vindicat∣ed of course; for the former is a full unanswerable vindication of the latter.</Q>
I will try this reasoning by a particular instance.</P>
<P>Mr. R. allows that it was refered to Adam to deter∣mine his own character and state. But Adam with these high powers committed to him did transgress and eat the
<PB N="79" REF="026990_0078_0FD2B52F6353F9D0"/>
forbidden fruit. Now how can providence be vindicat∣ed in suffering this to take place? Esily as I think, for since GOD had made him a moral agent, and set life and death before him, and his own choice and consequent actions were to determine his character and state, it was fit that he should be left to act for himself, and unfit that providence should interpose to stop him, and therefore what GOD could not do; as I have elsewere shown. But does this vindication of providence in the taking place of this event, vindicate a divine decree preordaining the e∣vent? By no means. For GOD's decrees are powerful and active, comprehending such means as shall unfrustr∣ably produce the event decreed. But to affirm this with regard to the first transgression, is to make GOD the author, and indeed the door of the sin; and frees Adam from all blame. Thus it appears that providence can be vindi∣cated in respect to things taking place as they do, when a degree preordaining the taking place of things as they do take place, cannot; but would be blasphemy to affirm. I am sorry to see such sophistry made use of, the truth never needs it. Mr. R. tells us p. 58.
<Q>If man will ob∣ject—let them fault the system and not the divine deter∣mination.—And evince that such a system in the final issue is not a good one.</Q>
Reply, I have no objections to the divine plan, I believe it wise, holy, just, and good, But I object to your plan as totally bad, unscriptural and antiscriptual, unfit for GOD to reveal or men to be∣lieve. And you may be sure Sir, that discourse contains no part of GOD's plan; if we are to judge of it by God's holy word, to which you refer us. Mr. R. proceeds.</P>
<P N="2"><Q>2. We may learn the obligation men are under to admit the doctrine which teaches, that GOD is a sover∣eign in the highest sense, an absolute sovereign.</Q>
That God bestows original favours in a sovereign way I have shown. But that he dispenses rewards and punishments in such a way is what I deny; and what Mr. R. can∣not prove.</P>
<P>He says p. 60, that with respect to mens eternal state,
<Q>Many will admit no such thing as a divine determina∣tion and disposal, insisting that it is left to men them∣selves
<PB N="80" REF="026990_0079_0FD2B5092163F170"/>
to determine their own character, and fix their own eternal state.</Q>
Reply, I have proved that it is left wholly with men to determine their own character and eternal estate, you must now therefore take back your call for the assent of your hearers and readers, to the contrary. Mr. R. proceeds.</P>
<P N="3"><Q>3. We may learn the importance not only of assent∣ing to the divine sovereignty, but also, of being cordially reconciled to it.</Q>
Reply, It is really of importance that we cordially submit, to the sovereignty of GOD, in the differ∣ence he makes among his creatures; in bestowing origi∣nal favours. But as sovereignty has been explained by Mr. R. we never ought to submit to it. Mr. R. tells us,
<Q>The wicked at the day of Judgement will without doubt be fully convinced of the truth and justice of that sentence, every mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th be stopped, &amp;c.</Q>
But why did he not consider, that his decree of election is absolute∣ly inconsistent with a day of Judgement; and with the self condemnation of all those, he tells us were passed by from eternity!</P>
<P>Mr. R. tells us that some,
<Q>Resent with acrimony the idea of GOD's determining the character, and disposing of the eternal state of men as he pleases. They who do thus are the enemies of GOD.</Q>
I am sorry to see such uncharitable judging in this good gentleman; and will impute it rather to his pernicious principles than to his want of a benevolent heart. It is doubtless the duty of every man to reject the idea, Mr. R. holds up to view, as infinitely dishonourable to the ever glorious God, and destructive of all religion. Mr. R. proceeds,</P>
<P N="4"><Q>4. We may infer, that want of submission to GOD's sovereignty, and the objections advanced against his uncontroulable dominion must be owing to something that is criminal and very wrong.</Q>
True, if the doct∣rine of the divine sovereignty be rightly explained. I have no reason to complain because GOD made me a man, and not an Angel; or because he gave my brother five talents, and me but two.</P>
<P N="5"><Q>5. We may learn what is necessary to remove objec∣tion from the hearts of men, &amp; effect a real reconciliation
<PB N="81" REF="026990_0080_0FD2B530C8457E20"/>
to GOD.</Q>
Mr. R. goes on to tell us, that this is not to be effected by the,
<Q>Proposal of arguments is and motives, most opposite and weighty.</Q>
But why did not Mr. R. consider, that in saying thus, he reflected upon the wis∣dom of GOD, in making use of this very method, under every dispensation, to bring men to be reconciled to himself? Reconciliation to GOD, Mr. R. tells us, can be effected no other way but by being <HI>born of God.</HI> I am sorry he has not told us what he means by being <HI>born of God</HI>; that we might know whether we have any part in it or not. If it is something that belongs wholly to GOD, then we are not to blame that the work is not done; and our being unreconciled is not our fault. Mr. R. proceeds,</P>
<P N="6"><Q>6. The subject presents a criterion by which men may try themselves, and come to know what manner of spirit they are of, know their true character and state.</Q>
Mr. R. proposes that we put it to ourselves, whether it seem proper and fit, that GOD should have mercy on whom he will, and harden to their eternal destruction whom he will: and whether we are willing to submit all to his arbitrament without any reservation. To me, this appears a very strange rule of trial. In order to know whether I am reconciled to GOD, I must find myself wil∣ling that my fellow creatures should be eternally destroy∣ed, and what is this but having a will opposed to the will of GOD, who has declared that he will have all men to be saved! That to be reconciled to GOD my will must oppose GOD's will! But perhaps Mr. R. may intend GOD's decretive, providential will, which according to him is in constant opposition to his preceptive will! Further Mr. R. would have me be willing to submit all to GOD's arbitrament without any reservation. If so, I see not but I must be willing to be damned myself, as well as have my neighbours damned. Mr. R. says, 'At this some may boggle.' I do not wonder he thought some would boggle. But he goes on to say,
<Q>If being willing to suffer the damnation of hell is implied in a true submission and reconciliation to GOD; such wil∣lingness would certainly be right and fit.</Q>

considering what a sort of creature man is, it is quite un∣fit that he should be willing to be damned. And if such willingness were necessary in order to reconciliation to GOD, I see not, but it is best man never should be recon∣ciled to GOD.</P>
<P>In p. 66 Mr. R. tells us plainly what he esteems true submission to GOD.
<Q>In true submission men resolve themselves into the will of GOD; and make a surrender to his disposals with no more than this: it may be he will have mercy, and if he doth not he is perfectly just and divinely glorious.</Q>
Mr. R. tells us, that it was the will of GOD from eternity, that some men should be damned, even all that he passed by. To be resolved in∣to the will of GOD, therefore, according to him, does imply, 1st. That I am willing that some of my fellow creatures should be damned. 2d. That I am willing to be damned myself upon it so falling out, that I am one that was passed by. But is this right? must I be wil∣ling that those for whom Christ died should be damned eternally? That those whom GOD will have to be saved should be damned eternally? How does this agree with my duty to love and pray for all? And as to being wil∣ling to be damned myself, 'tis the same as to be willing to oppose the will of GOD and Christ.</P>
<P>Furthermore, Mr. R. tells me that in true submission I must say that GOD is perfectly just, though he doth not have mercy on me. At this I shall certainly 'boggle.' For I do not see it to be equitable, that such a difference should be made, by the great parent of all between the children of his family, and where there is no equity, there is no justice. I believe it to be unjust and cruel in the highest degree, to choose one and pass by another, as Mr. R. tells us GOD did from eternity. But blessed be GOD we have no evidence of such a decree of election but Mr. R's word; which we count not worth a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rush, in this case. As to what Mr. R. says, about our sub∣mitting the matter of our salvation to GOD, I think he is wholly wrong. When we pray for earthly good things, as food, friends, &amp;c. we ought to pray for these with submission to the will of GOD; because GOD has
<PB N="83" REF="026990_0082_0FD2B532BADEC530"/>
not made his will known to us in these matters, other∣wise than in general terms; we ought therefore, to refer ourselves to the will, wisdom and goodness of GOD, to be dealt with as he sees best for us, in our present state of education. But not so with regard to eternal life, be∣cause GOD has expressly told us that it is his will we we should have eternal life. To pray therefore for this with submission as for earthly good things would be to call in question the truth of GOD's word, which declares GOD willing the salvation of all men. In prayer there∣fore we are to consider eternal salvation as what GOD wills we should have, and what his grace has brought to eve∣ry man, and what no man can miss of upon any other terms but his own putting of it away from him. Upon the whole, it is my opinion, that what Mr. R. calls a true submission to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is what would be very wrong, wicked and sinful for any man to make. As to what Mr. R. has said about an eternal refusal to submit to GOD, belonging to the character and state of the damned, who he says will be the eternal enemies of GOD. I freely own I do not believe it. But be it so, according to Mr. R. this is agreeable to the will of GOD! But I would pray him to consider how he can reconcile this opinion of his, to the Apostle, 1 Cor. xv. 26, The last enemy shall be destroyed, death.</P>
<P>Mr. R's discourse closes with a word of advice to pro∣fane sinners, the self righteous and awakened sinners. I wonder the good gentleman did not consider, that if he was ever asked a reason for this, he must be silent, or do worse. Pray sir, how could you be so cruel to profane sinners, as to try to terrify them with fear of hell, when you know their state was determined from eternity. And in this discourse you declare that no state of mind has the least influence in the divine determination respecting the bestowment of mercy? How could you go about to ter∣rify and trouble the self-righteous, when certainly self-righteousness is better than no righteousness, and you know that no righteousness can break up GOD's eternal decrees? How could you caution awakened sinners a∣gainst delusions and mistakes, as though they were in
<PB N="84" REF="026990_0083_0FD2B50C9DF12170"/>
danger from these? When you know, that all that GOD chose from eternity must be saved, and all he passed by must perish? Had you been consistent with your self, you would have told the profane, never to admit fear or care about their future state. The self righteous, to persevere in their self righteousness, as it was good and profitable unto men. And the awakened you would have soothed as much as possible, and plainly told them that their fears were quite fruitless.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. I shall conclude as proposed by a letter to the Rev. Mr. ROBBINS.</P>
<P>REV. SIR, as you submitted your discourse, to pub∣lic inspection, you will not be offended with me that I have examined it. Had I not Judged upon reading of it, that it was most dishonorable to GOD, injurious to re∣ligion, and greatly encouraging sin, I had not taken such notice of it as I have. I have constantly endeavoured to understand your true meaning; and am not sensible that I have in any instance mistaken it. I am a total strang∣er to you, otherwise than by reading the discourse that is now before me. Most certainly Sir I read your dis∣course without any prejudice against your person. But perhaps two men professing Christianity never thought more differently from each other than we do. But al∣though I look upon your discourse, taken connectively as not containing one word of truth in it; yet I am wil∣ling to consider you sir, as one that truly fears GOD, loves the truth and would knowingly do nothing against it. Dr. Williams says of Dr. Crisp, that he believes he was a pious and Godly man: that his life was a contra∣diction to his doctrines; that the grace of GOD preser∣ved his heart from being corrupted, by his wicked blasphemous opinions. I am willing to have the same opinion dear sir, of you; and would treat you accordingly. We are here in a dark state, and know but in part; I would ever be jealous of myself, that I may be wrong, willing to see my own mistakes, and make all charitable allowance for the mistakes of my brethren. I am satis∣fied that you think, or did when you published, that your opinion was right and would bear examination: For
<PB N="85" REF="026990_0084_0FD2B533D88E2200"/>
otherwise you would not have submitted it to public inspection; in a day so remarkable as this for free en∣quiry. Pious frauds will no longer do, mystical di∣vinity is going out of vogue; and men insist now upon plain common sense. Had your discourse been publi∣shed a hundred years ago, a great part of the Divines called Calvinistical would have disliked it, on account of its making GOD the author of sin; which although it was Calvin's opinion, yet it has not been universally acknowledged by his followers. But there is but little comparison between the light enjoyed one hundred years ago, and the light we enjoy.</P>
<P>We now clearly see that all the old creeds, consci∣sions of faith &amp;c. are wrong. That to have a discourse like yours come abroad, in a day like ours, for light and liberty, is strange indeed. Men in our nation have too high a sense of their liberty, to submit to doctrine that sets them upon a level with the brutal creation. Such doctrine will do among slaves, but not among freemen. You could not expect that any, who knew what it was to be men, or sinners; would ever approve of your doctrine. A doctrine which degrades men into brutes, and makes sin impossible to them. I have of∣ten thought, that the goodness of GOD is to be admired, in so ordering of it, that men think nearly as differently from each other as they look: as hereby they are render∣ed so much the more necessary and useful to each other, and have the noblest opportunity for the exercise of char∣ity. But it will be thought strange that men devoted to study, should be so extremely wide of each other as we are. And to what can this great difference be attributed, unless one or the other of us, have been hampered with a system? And so have studied rather to defend some∣thing that we took for truth, without due examination; than to find out what was true.</P>
<P>You may, dear sir, think that I am blinded by bigo∣try, and see only with the eyes of others: but I think none acquainted with me, will have that opinion of me. For thirty years past, I have studied without shackles, as I think; fully convinced that the truth was not to be
<PB N="86" REF="026990_0085_0FD2B50D8C24EEB8"/>
found among the savings of men; but is rooted in things, I have sought it where, as I apprehend it is only to be found. And when I have discovered it at any time, I have not been afraid to make it known for the good of others; however contrary to prevailing opinions. But do my dear brother, give me leave, without offence, to tell you, that I fear you have taken opinions too much upon trust; and have layed too much weight upon the sayings of men. If not, how could one of your discern∣ing, so mistake the meaning of the scripture you founded your discourse upon? How could you consider sin as the effect of the will and agency of GOD? What! sin the choice of that being who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity! I have heard it scoffingly said, that 'tis an article of faith in Connecticut, that GOD is the author of sin. Because the confession of faith adopted by the elders and messengers of the Churches, assembled at Saybrook, 1708, says, GOD's determinate counsel exten∣deth itself even to the first fall, and all other sins of an∣gels and men, and that not by a bare permission. But I did not think, 'till I read your discourse, that there was a minister now in the State that would avow that blasphemous sentiment.</P>
<P>How could you say that GOD orders the occasion, and withholds influence necessary to prevent sin? which makes sin necessary, and lays the blame at GOD's door! For a deficient cause in things necessary, is truely effici∣ent.</P>
<P>How could you so limit the knowledge of the Deity, as to suppose things properly contingent unknowable to him? Surely all things are done contingently in respect to GOD, which for ought he hath decreed, might with as much possibility not be as be. But all things which are done by the creatures voluntarily, may as well not be done, as done. Therefore, if GOD hath decreed, that many things should be done voluntarily, he hath decreed, that they should be done contingently. The minor is evident, because, if the creatures may not as well omit them as do them, they do them not voluntarily, but necessarily. How could you charge sin and blame upon
<PB N="87" REF="026990_0086_0FD2B537C5188CD8"/>
men, meerly for acting voluntarily in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which is evil? Surely the prerogative of a voluntary agent consisteth not in doing that which it desireth to do; but in liber∣ty of choice to do or not to do, this or that, not in free∣dom from coercion only, but in freedom from necessity also. How could you argue from the necessary holiness of GOD, that necessity may consist with liberty among men; since he is above and out of all predicaments wherein we are. How could you argue from GOD's right and propriety in all things, that it belongs to him to dispose of the eternal state of men; in sin and damna∣tion, according to his good pleasure? we know that by GOD's absolute and naked power, he can cast away the whole mass of mankind; it is not repugnant to sove∣reignty: but by that actual power of his, which is al∣ways clothed with goodness and justice, he cannot of his pleasure cast away one. How could you say, that all men being sinners, GOD is not obliged to exercise his saving mercy towards any? Is he not bound by his de∣cree, by his promise, and by his giving sinners of men a law to keep?</P>
<P>How could you adopt the opinion of absolute elec∣tion and reprobation? an opinion which drags after it the most absurd, wicked and blasphemous consequences. Absolute reprobation being once granted, we may more properly call GOD a father of cruelties, than of mercies; and of hatred rather than of love; and a destroyer of men, rather than the saviour of men. Mr. Fletcher, illustrates this, by a mother that "conceived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n unac∣countable antipathy to her sucking child. She goes to the brink of a precipice, bends herself over it with the passive infant in her bosom, and, withdrawing her arms from under him, drops him upon the craggy side of a rock, and thus he rolls down from rock to rock, 'till he lies at the bottom beaten to pieces, a bloody instance of finished destruction. The Judge asks the murderer what she has to say in her own defence. The child was mine, replies she, and I have a right to do what I please with my own. Besides, I did neither throw him down, nor murder him: I only withdrew my arms from under
<PB N="88" REF="026990_0087_0FD2B50F044C47E0"/>
him, and he fell of his own accord." Upon your prin∣ciples sir, this mother must be acquitted with honour; but common sense will condemn the murderer. These and many other, like sentiments in your discourse, satis∣fied me that a gentleman of your discerning, would never embrace such opinions, had not your mind been warp'd by the opinions of others. Hence I concluded on reading your discourse, that you was defending the opinions of other men rather than your own. And seve∣ral words and phrases in your discourse, which I obser∣ved, made me think that you had been mislead by Mr. Edwards' treatise on the will; than which I know of no book, where so much labour and pains is taken to so little purpose. I own the book, but have it not now by me, if I had, I would give you a confutation of it in one page, though, as I remember it contains near four hundred. But you may find the sinews of Mr. Edwards' arguments out by the ingenious Mr. West of Newbedford; in an essay on liberty and necessity, lately published. What conceivable absurdity dear sir, can be more shocking to the human mind, not corrupted with a false glare of vain science, than for men to commend or blame themselves, or for others to do it, for what they are no more the causes of, than of the beating of their pulse, and could no more prevent than the ebbing and flowing of the sea! This plan of fatalism which Mr. Edwards pleads for, and which you have adopted; is wholly the product of metaphysical subtility; and in direct contra∣diction to the invariable consciousness mankind have of a power within themselves to give motion to the facul∣ties both of their souls and bodies. Nay, even those who pretend to believe the doctrine of fatal causalty, directly contradict, by their practical sentiments, and in a steady uniform course, what they possess in words. For their whole conduct in life is just as theirs is, who really think they are possessed of an active self-moving power, and are the causes of their own volitions, and the effects consequent upon them. So their practice in life is a confutation of their faith in theory. I beseech you my dear brother to review your whole scheme, turn it upon
<PB N="89" REF="026990_0088_0FD2B53B2C80CAB0"/>
all sides, trace it in all its consequences; and see where and to what they will lead you.</P>
<P>I have passed over in silence many things exception∣able in your discourse, because I would not be tedious. And things that I have a little examined, I have not pur∣sued in there consequences as I might have done. Read dear Sir, the remarks I have made on your discourse, in the spirit of love. Be assured that your opponent is not your enemy. If any thing justly offensive has escaped my pen, I will certainly retract it the moment I see it. If after all you remain of the same mind, as when you pub∣lished your discourse, you will doubtless think that there is something necessary now for you to do; in order to defend your discourse, against the exceptions I have made to it. I am quite willing you should do your utmost to defend your scheme. But you know my dear brother, that there is a certain number of first principles, or primary moral truths, which are perceived and assented to, with∣out hesitation, by mankind in common; in consequence of that power of discernment they come into being furn∣ished with, and are the only basis on which there can be reasoning to any purpose among men, with relation to the moral system. Hence, the further any one proceeds in error the further he departs from those primary truths, which form the basis of reasoning and consequently will be the more easily detected. If it is my case, that I am in the wrong, as you may likely think; the further I go the weaker I shall grow. And at length become a very easy tool to deal with. Should this be the case, I will rejoice, may the truth but grain ground.</P>
<P>Controversy, though not desirable in it self, yet pro∣perly managed, has often times rescued truth groaning under the lash of triumphant error. To pay a strict at∣tention to the thing, or object in dispute, and use no other artillery against an adversary, than soft words and hard arguments, is generally the best way to manage a dispute. If you should write again in defence of your scheme, whatever you advance, that is argumentative and to the point, you may depend upon my careful, and I hope candid examination; should it please GOD to spare life
<PB N="90" REF="026990_0089_0FD2B53C0F5648E8"/>
and continue health. But any thing that is other∣wise I shall treat with silence.</P>
<P>But as wide as we now are in opinion from each other, what hinders our being one in love? Let us my dear brother, notwithstanding our difference in opinion, love one another out of a pure heart fervently, as the gospel of Christ directs. Constantly praying for each other, that the GOD of patience and consolation would grant us to be like minded, one towards another according to Christ Jesus.</P>
