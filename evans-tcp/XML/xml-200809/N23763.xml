<HEAD>MESSAGE from the PRESIDENT of the <HI>United States</HI>:</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SEND herewith, a copy of the Treaty of Friend∣ship, Limits, and Navigation, concluded on the 27th of October last, between the United States and his Catholic Majesty. This treaty has been ratified by me, agreeably to the constitution; and the ratification has been dispatched for Spain, where it will doubtless be immediately ratified by his Catholic Majesty.</P>
<P>This early communication of the treaty with Spain has become necessary, because it is stipulated, in the third article, that commissioners, for running the boun∣dary line between the territory of the United States and the Spanish colonies of East and West Florida, shall meet at the Natchez, before the expiration of six months from the ratification. And as that period will undoubt∣edly arrive before the next meeting of Congress, the House will see the necessity of making provision, in their present session, for the object here mentioned. It will also be necessary to provide for the expense to be incur∣red in executing the twenty-first article of the treaty, to enable our fellow-citizens to obtain, with as little delay as possible, compensation for the losses they have sus∣tained by the capture of their vessels and cargoes by the subjects of his Catholic Majesty, during the late war be∣tween France and Spain.</P>
<P>Estimates of the monies, necessary to be provided, for the purposes of this and several other treaties with foreign nations and the Indian tribes will be laid before you by the proper department.</P>

<HEAD><HI>TREATY</HI> between the United States and the King of Spain.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Catholic Majesty and the United States of America desiring to consolidate on a permanent basis the friendship and good correspondence which hap∣pily prevails between the two parties, have determined to establish by a convention several points, the settle∣ment whereof will be productive of general advantage and reciprocal utility to both nations.</P>
<P>With this intention his Catholic Majesty has appointed the most excellent Lord Don Manuel de Godoy, and Alvarez de Faria, Rios, Sanchez Zarzosa Prince de la Paz: Duke de la Alcudia: Lord of the Soto de Roma, and of the state of Albala: Grandee of Spain of the first class: perpetual Regidor of the city of Santiago: Knight of the illustrious order of the Golden Fleece, and Great Cross of the Royal and distinguished Spanish order of Charles the 3d.

And the said Plenipotentiaries have agreed upon and concluded the following articles:</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="article">
<PB N="6" REF="031418_0004_0FEC52D3867BD9E0"/>
<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<P>There shall be a firm and inviolable peace and sincere friendship between his Catholic Majesty his successors and subjects, and the United States and their citizens, without exception of persons or places.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE II.</HEAD>
<P>To prevent all disputes on the subject of the bounda∣ries which separate the territories of the two high con∣tracting parties, it is hereby declared and agreed as fol∣lows, to wit: The southern boundary of the United States, which divides their territory from the Spanish colonies of East and West Florida, shall be designated by a line beginning on the river Missisippi at the norther∣most part of the thirty-first degree of latitude north of the equator which from thence shall be drawn due east to the middle of the river Apalachicola or Catahouche; thence along the middle thereof to its junction with the Flint: thence straight to the head of St. Mary's river, and thence down the middle thereof to the Atlantic ocean. And it is agreed that if there should be any troops, garrisons or settlements of either party in the territory of the other according to the above-mentioned boundaries, they shall be withdrawn from the said terri∣tory within the term of six months after the ratification of this treaty, or sooner if it be possible; and that they shall be permitted to take with them all the goods and effects which they possess.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE III.</HEAD>
<P>In order to carry the preceding article into effect, one commissioner and one surveyor shall be appointed by each of the contracting parties, who shall meet at the Natches on the left side of the river Missisippi before the expiration of six months from the ratification of this convention, and they shall proceed to run and mark this boundary according to the stipulations of the said article. They shall make plats and keep journals of
<PB N="7" REF="031418_0005_0FEC52D5476C2198"/>
their proceedings, which shall be considered as part of this convention, and shall have the same force as if they were inserted therein. And if on any account it should be found necessary that the said commissioners and sur∣veyors should be accompanied by guards, they shall be furnished in equal proportions by the commanding offi∣cer of his Majesty's troops in the two Floridas, and the commanding officer of the troops of the United States in their south-western territory, who shall act by com∣mon consent and amicably as well with respect to this point, as to the furnishing of provisions and instruments, and making every other arrangement which may be ne∣cessary or useful for the execution of this article.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE IV.</HEAD>
<P>It is likewise agreed that the western boundary of the United States which separates them from the Spanish colony of Louissiana, is in the middle of the channel or bed of the river Missisippi from the northern boundary of the said States to the completion of the thirty-first de∣gree of latitude north of the equator. And his Catholic Majesty has likewise agreed that the navigation of the said river in its whole breadth from its source to the ocean shall be free only to his subjects and the citizens of the United States, unless he should extend this pri∣vilege to the subjects of other powers by special conven∣tion.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE V.</HEAD>
<P>The two high contracting parties shall by all the means in their power maintain peace and harmony among the several Indian nations who inhabit the country adjacent to the lines and rivers which by the preceding articles form the boundaries of the two Floridas. And the better to obtain this effect, both parties oblige them∣selves expressly to restrain by force all hostilities on the part of the Indian nations living within their boundary: so that Spain will not suffer her Indians to attack the the citizens of the United States nor the Indians inha∣biting
<PB N="8" REF="031418_0006_0FEC52DAE792DC00"/>
their territory; nor will the United States per∣mit these last mentioned Indians to commence hostilities against the subjects of his Catholic Majesty or his Indians in any manner whatever.</P>
<P>And whereas several treaties of friendship exist be∣tween the two contracting parties and the said nations of Indians, it is hereby agreed that in future no treaty of alliance or other whatever (except treaties of peace) shall be made by eitheir party with the Indians living within the boundary of the other, but both parties will endeavor to make the advantages of the Indian trade common and mutually beneficial to their respective sub∣jects and citizens observing in all things the most com∣plete reciprocity, so that both parties may obtain the advantages arising from a good understanding with the said nations without being subject to the expence which they have hitherto occasioned.</P>

His Catholic Majesty shall name one commissioner, and the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of their Senate shall appoint ano∣ther, and the said two commissioners shall agree on the choice of a third or if they cannot agree so, they shall each propose one person, and of the two names so pro∣posed one shall be drawn by lot in the presence of the two original commissioners, and the person whose name shall be so drawn shall be the third commissioner: and the three commissioners so appointed shall be sworn im∣partially to examine and decide the claims in question according to the merits of the several cases, and to jus∣tice, equity and the laws of nations.
