<HEAD>The TESTIMONY &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S it is a great Satisfaction to us that the most of us join'd with many worthy Ministers in their Assembly met on Pur∣pose at <HI>Boston, July</HI> 7. 1743, in yielding to the sovereign GOD thro' CHRIST the Glory due to his Power and Grace for the late <HI>extraordinary Work</HI> of HIS SPIRIT in diverse Parts of the Land; in <HI>awakening Multitudes to a deep Concern about their eternal Salvation, carrying on the Con∣victions of Sin. Righteousness and Judgment in great Num∣bers, to the scriptural and charitable Marks of true Con∣version, as well as reviving the Power of Godliness in many who were accounted the regenerate Children of God before:</HI> — So we yet rejoyce that we have farther Oc∣casion to Praise him for the <HI>continued Evidence</HI> of the Grace of Christ in the most of those we are acquainted with, whom from the Marks laid down in Scripture we look'd upon to be converted, and that the <HI>Liveliness of Piety</HI> remains in many. For <HI>these</HI> there is also due a Return of Glory to God: and in Imitation of the pious Examples of the Saints in Scripture, we would earnestly call on Them, Ourselves, and Others, to yield it to Him.</P>
<P>But as in the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Apostles</HI> Days, in the later Days of the <HI>Reformers</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> and in all other Times of the extraordinary Influence of the Spirit of God and Revival of Piety, whether of a larger or less Extent; they have been but <HI>of a short Duration;</HI> the Impressions
<PB N="4" REF="005544_0003_10185AF24ECA8F60"/>
on many have been ineffectual to true Conversion, their Goodness has been like <HI>Ephraim</HI>'s of old, <HI>as the Morning Cloud and early Dew, which have quickly pass'd away;</HI> yea, the DIVINE SPIRIT being slighted, he has withdrawn his Influence more than before, and given them up to a greater Blindness and Hardness than ever; yea the most flourishing Churches in Piety have soon lost their vigo∣rous Love to Christ like the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and declined to such an hateful Lukewarmness of Religion, like that of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> as to be on the Point of being utterly rejected:— So we have in our lively Times been fearful of the <HI>like Decay</HI> and <HI>Withdraw,</HI> and gave Warn∣ing of them; and answerable to our Apprehensions, they seem to be awfully coming to pass, and are to be deeply lamented.</P>
<P>And tho' in <HI>Seasons</HI> of <HI>extraordinary Revivals,</HI> as in the <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Reformers</HI> Days, there were <HI>many Dis∣orders</HI> and <HI>Errors</HI> among professing Christians; and no other cou'd be expected among us on the like Occasion, which have been openly and repeatedly testified against by many of the Friends of this Revival in diverse Parts of the Land: yet upon Observation of the several Chur∣ches we respectively belong to, we cannot but also testify, that Disorders and Errors have been both multiplied and magnified by unfriendly Reporters, much more than they really were where there▪ were any, but in many of our Churches there were none at all; and <HI>the Work of the</HI> HOLY SPIRIT in our Churches, <HI>as above described,</HI> has been grievously misrepresented and defamed, his genuine Operations overlooked or perverted, He has been denied of his deserved Glory for them; but the <HI>Infirmities and Corruptions</HI> of Men, permitted of the righteous God as usual to mingle with them, have been represented as <HI>the Work itself,</HI> and then under <HI>their Name</HI> this divine Trans∣action awfully set at nought, as has also been usual in other Revivals, to the Reproach of the World.</P>
<P>Among other Abuses it has been represented as if <HI>such mischievous Errors</HI> as <HI>these</HI> were <HI>prevailing</HI> among
<PB N="5" REF="005544_0004_10185AF831C57868"/>
the <HI>Subjects</HI> of <HI>this Revival</HI> in <HI>these Churches,</HI> viz (1) That sanctifying Grace in a Minister is necessary to render the Administration of Gospel Ordinances valid. (2) That unconverted Ministers are uncapable to be Instruments of converting People. (3) That Sanctification, [i. e. as described in the Assembly's shorter Catechism] is no Evidence of Justification. (4) That an unconverted Man ought not to pray. [5] That Assurance is essential to saving Faith, so that whoever savingly believes is certain of it and not in Darkness or Doubt about it. [6] That they slight the inspired Scriptures as a perfect Rule of Faith and Duty. [7] That they may leave the Scrip∣tures and follow Impulses, Dreams &amp; Trances. And [8] That Good Works are vilified or slighted by them. For we can find but few in our Churches and in many of our Churches none at all holding any of <HI>these</HI> or any other <HI>Familistical</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Familistical</HI>— From a <HI>Sect</HI> who called themselves <HI>the Family of Love:</HI> which denied the Scripture to be a Rule of Faith and Life, and that there is any Hell or Heaven but in us; and held that the Regenerate do not Sin, and that Grace within them is CHRIST himself &amp;c.</NOTE> or <HI>Antinomian</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antinomian</HI> — i.e. <HI>Against the Law</HI> — a <HI>Sect</HI> who deny the moral Law to be a Rule of Life to Believers; and hold Justification from Eternity, that GOD sees no Sin in his People, nor afflicts them for it, that Believers must not look at Grace within them or take any Comfort from the Evi∣dence of it, and that Sanctification is no Evidence of Justi∣fication &amp;c.</NOTE> Errors, which we testify against. But have the Pleasure to see them more strongly believing and more highly esteeming <HI>the Bible</HI> than ever; that they only style <HI>our good Works</HI> as the Scriptures do — <HI>filthy Rags,</HI> consider'd as <HI>a Righte∣ousness to justify</HI> us in the Sight of the most holy God; and that the <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>their Faith</HI> is the same as they have been all along instructed in from the Scripture Truths laid down in the <HI>Westminster Assembly's shorter Catechism;</HI> which has been generally receiv'd &amp; taught in the Churches of <HI>New-England</HI> from it's first Publica∣tion
<PB N="6" REF="005544_0005_10185AF9B958B1D0"/>
for about these <HI>Hundred Years:</HI> which is therefore <HI>the System</HI> of Scripture Doctrine most generally and clearly declarative of <HI>the Faith</HI> of the <HI>New-England Churches;</HI> which Doctrines are very dear to <HI>the Subjects</HI> of this Revival in our own, being made more dear by the happy Experience of their Power and Influence; and we wish were as dear to those who equally reproach their Persons as their Creeds and Confessions of the glorious Truths of the Gospel: and <HI>which excellent Confessions</HI> we are grieved to see even Publickly reviled among us.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Encouragers</HI> of <HI>this Revival,</HI> among whom we apprehend Ourselves included, are injuriously charged with departing from the <HI>ancient Faith</HI> of <HI>these Churches;</HI> and as GOD in his Word requires us to make <HI>a publick Profession</HI> of <HI>our Faith,</HI> and <HI>let the World know</HI> that <HI>we hold it fast continually;</HI> as this is the Duty, Right and Liberty of every Christian, especially of every <HI>Minister;</HI> and we conceive no Season can be more suitable than when we <HI>enter the Ministry,</HI> or are after <HI>represented as Erroneous,</HI> or when there are <HI>Jealousies</HI> among the Peo∣ple that many Ministers have left the ancient Faith; as a <HI>meer Profession</HI> of our <HI>Faith</HI> in CHRIST in general is no Declaration of what we really believe, inasmuch as some who profess Him believe Him not to be GOD, others not to be <HI>Man,</HI> some that He is only GOD, some that He is only <HI>Man,</HI> and it may be some that He was only a <HI>meer Apparition;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the <HI>Manicheos</HI> and <HI>Marcionites.</HI></NOTE> yea as a late noted Writer <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Woolston.</NOTE> has in his own Example shown us, that a <HI>meer Profession</HI> of our <HI>Belief</HI> of THE SCRIPTURE is no Declaration of our real Belief at all, inasmuch as we may believe it <HI>not</HI> to be a <HI>real History, but</HI> a <HI>meer Allegory:</HI> Therefore we cannot but judge that every <HI>Christian,</HI> and especially every <HI>Minister,</HI> ought honestly and openly to make such a <HI>definitive Profession</HI> of <HI>their Faith</HI> in CHRIST and the SCRIPTURE, as the World may know what they really mean or would be understood to mean thereby. And
<PB N="7" REF="005544_0006_10185AFB42486960"/>
as <HI>our Fathers</HI> made a <HI>publick Confession</HI> of <HI>their Faith</HI> in <HI>their Day,</HI> and recommended it to us their Posterity; we cannot but judge Ourselves as <HI>Now</HI> called both by God and Man, and even obliged by Those who write and speak against us, to make such <HI>a Publick Profession</HI> of <HI>our own Faith</HI> to the World: and in particular <HI>openly</HI> and <HI>freely</HI> to DECLARE, that <HI>we have not departed from the ancient Faith of these Churches;</HI> but <HI>heartily adhere to the same;</HI> and look upon the said <HI>Westminster assem∣bly's shorter Catechism</HI> and the famous <HI>Confession of Faith</HI> agreed on by our venerable <HI>Synod</HI> of 1680 (which <HI>Con∣fession</HI> for the refreshing our Memory we have diligently read over at this Meeting) as most valuable Summaries of Christian Doctrine, excellently expressing the Mind and Will of GOD as reveal'd in the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> the only infallible Rule of Faith and Practice: and which <HI>Confession</HI> we wish to be reprinted and dispersed speedily for the publick Benefit, and would earnestly recommend both to Preachers and People, both of this and future Generations.</P>
<P>We cannot but also observe that the <HI>principal Means</HI> of <HI>the late Revival</HI> were the <HI>more than ordinary preaching</HI> up <HI>such Scripture</HI> and <HI>most important Doctrines</HI> as these — viz. The All-seeing Eye, Purity, Justice, Truth, Power, Majesty and Sovereignty of God: the Spirituality, Ho∣liness, Extent and Strictness of his Law: our original Sin, Guilt, Depravity and Corruption by the Fall; in∣cluding a miserable Ignorance of God &amp; Enmity against Him, our predominant and constant Bent to Sin and Creatures above Him, our Impotence and Aversion to return to Him: our innumerable and heinous actual Offences; and thereby our horrid aggravated Guilt Pol∣lution and Odiousness in his Eyes: His dreadful and efficacious Wrath and Curse upon us: the Necessity that his Law should he fulfilled, his Justice satisfied, the Ho∣nour of his Holiness, Authority and Truth maintained in his Conduct towards us; our utter Impotence to help our selves; and our continual Hazard of being
<PB N="8" REF="005544_0007_10185AFFEACE4C38"/>
sent into endless Misery: the astonishing Displays of the absolute Wisdom and Grace of GOD in contriving and providing for our Redemption: the Divinity, Media∣tion, perfect Holiness, Obedience, Sacrifice, Merits, Satisfaction, Purchase and Grace of CHRIST: the Nature and Necessity of Regeneration to the holy Image of GOD by the supernatural Operation of the DIVINE SPIRIT; with the various Parts of his Office in enlightening our Minds, awakening our Consciences, wounding, break∣ing, humbling, subduing and changing our Hearts, in∣fusing his saving Graces, exciting and helping us in the Exercise of them, and in all Obedience, witnessing with our Spirits that we are the Children of God, and raising his Consolations and Joys in us: the Difference between his saving Graces and meerly moral Virtues without Sanctification, whereby Multitudes are deceived to their eternal Ruin: In special, the Nature and Necessity of receiving Christ, so as to be actually united to Him and have intire and everlasting Interest in Him; to be forth∣with justified by his imputed Righteousness, adopted into the Number of the Children of God, intitled to all their Priviledges assured in the Covenant of Grace, have CHRIST as our mediatorial and vital Head of all Good, with his constant dwelling &amp; acting by his Spirit in us: and then in continual Acts of Faith deriving from Him fresh Supplies of spiritual Liveliness &amp; Comfort, as also Light and Strength for every Duty and to carry on our Sanctification: the Nature of Gospel Obedience &amp; Holi∣ness, and their Necessity, not as the Matter of our Justifi∣cation, but as the Fruit and Evidence of justifying Faith, and to glorify GOD and enjoy Him the principal End both of our Creation and Redemption: and lastly, the Sovereignty of the Grace of God in this whole Trans∣action, from its Original in the Decree of Election to its Consummation in Glory.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>more than ordinary Preaching</HI> up <HI>these great Truths</HI> of reveal'd Religion and experimental Piety, being the same which were so successfully preached by
<PB N="9" REF="005544_0008_10185B0308026A40"/>
the first sound and pious <HI>Fathers</HI> of <HI>New England,</HI> have been the <HI>principal Means</HI> of <HI>the late Revival;</HI> we are sorry to see, that under the Name of <HI>New Light,</HI> many of the <HI>Preachers</HI> of these most important Truths, and especially those which concern the <HI>Office</HI> and <HI>Operation</HI> of the SPIRIT <HI>of Grace</HI> in bringing lost and perishing Souls to Christ, are by many run down and ridicul'd; as those our pious <HI>Forefathers</HI> were in their Day, under the same or alike reproachful Terms, by many on the other Side of the Water; and <HI>they</HI> who <HI>Preach</HI> the <HI>same Truths</HI> of the Gospel and experimental Piety as those great Divines, <HI>Hooker, Cotton, Shepard, Goodwin, Owen, Flavel,</HI> the <HI>Mathers, Willard, Stoddard,</HI> are represented by some as <HI>New Light, Enthusiastical</HI> or <HI>Antinomian</HI> Preachers: whereby the awful Danger grows of banish∣ing even the <HI>Faith</HI> of the <HI>glorious Office</HI> of THAT DIVINE AGENT in the Work of Conviction, Conversion, Sancti∣fication and Comfort, first out of our Pulpits, and then out of the Land. Yea, to so deplorable a Pass have some Traducers of this Revival brought us, that if any of the young Generation begin to leave off their Cursing, Swearing, immoderate Drinking, obscene Discourse, grow concern'd for their Souls, and repair to the Word; they are immediately branded and vilified by their vain Com∣panions with the Name of <HI>New-Lights,</HI> and Efforts are made to laugh them out of their serious Concern for their Souls and Eternity; which we fear has been the ruinous Case of many.</P>
<P>In such an awful-Scituation of Things as this, we cannot but apprehend that the DIVINE HEAD of the Church now loudly calls <HI>us,</HI> and <HI>all others</HI> who seriously believe &amp; are deeply concerned for <HI>those great Truths of the Gospel</HI> as collected in the abovesaid <HI>Catechism</HI> &amp; <HI>Con∣fession of Faith,</HI> with the Interest of <HI>vital Piety;</HI> — with∣out imposing in the least on Others, or assuming any Au∣thority over the Conscience of any, which we utterly abhor as directly contrary to the very Nature of Religion itself; — <HI>To unite</HI> our <HI>Resolutions</HI> &amp; <HI>Endeavours,</HI> by all proper
<PB N="10" REF="005544_0009_10185B0726801440"/>
Means consistent with Liberty of Conscience, to maintain, encourage and promote <HI>the same.</HI></P>
<P>And as in the <HI>doctrinal Truths</HI> of the Gospel, the <HI>New England Churches</HI> have always happily agreed with the reformed and renowned <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Scotland;</HI> we cannot but on this Occasion testify our high and hearty Appro∣bation of the <HI>doctrinal Part</HI> of that excellent &amp; famous ACT of their General Assembly <HI>concerning Preaching</HI> made in 1736; which is as follows—</P>
<Q><TEXT>

<HEAD><HI>VII. ACT</HI> concerning Preaching.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Edinburgh, <DATE><HI>May</HI> 21. 1736. Sess. 8.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE General Assembly being moved with Zeal for the Honour of God and our Lord Jesus Christ, especially at a Time when the Christian Revelation is openly impugned, and <HI>Infidelity, Deism,</HI> and <HI>other Errors</HI> do so much prevail: They do hereby recommend to <HI>all Ministers</HI> and <HI>Preachers,</HI> seriously to consider &amp; observe the Directory of this Church concerning the Preaching of the Word, which is approven by the General assembly <HI>1645:</HI> And in particular, that they be careful to warn their Hearers against any Thing tending to <HI>Atheism, (1) Deism (2), Arianism (3), Socinianism (4), Arminia∣nism (5), Bourignianism (6), Popery (7), Superstition (8), Antinomianism (9),</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Explication</HI> of these Terms in the APPENDIX.</NOTE>or <HI>any other Errors:</HI> &amp; that in their Sermons they insist frequently upon the Truth, Necessity and Excellency of supernatural Revelation; the supreme <HI>Deity</HI> of the <HI>SON</HI> &amp; <HI>HOLY GHOST</HI> as well as of the <HI>FA∣THER;</HI> together with the <HI>Oneness of the GODHEAD,</HI> our sinful and lost Estate by Nature, the Necessity of super-natural Grace, and of Faith in the Righteousness of Christ, without which the best Works cannot please God: and that they make it the great Scope of their Sermons, to lead Sinners from a <HI>Covenant of Works</HI> to a <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> for Life and Salvation, and from <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Self</HI> to precious <HI>CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005544_0010_10185B08AD8E4AE0"/>And the General Assembly recommends to <HI>all who Preach</HI> the Gospel, when they handle the Doctrines of God's redeeming Love, and of his free Grace in the Justification and Salvation of Sinners, the Blessings of the Redeemer's Purchase, and Priviledges of the new and better Covenant; to study to manage these Subjects, so as to lead their Hearers to an Abhorence of Sin, the Love of God and our Neighbours, and the Practice of universal Holiness; seeing it is one great End of the Gospel, to destroy the Works of the Devil, and to teach Men to live soberly, righteously and godly in this present World. Upon which Account, it is incumbent on <HI>all who preach</HI> the Gospel, to insist not only on the Necessity and Excellency of Faith in Jesus Christ for Salvation, but also upon the Necessity of Repentance for Sin, and Refor∣mation from it; and to press the Practice of all moral Duties, both with respect to the first and second Table of the Law, as indispensably necessary, in Obedience to God's Command, to testify our Gratitude to Him, to evidence the sincerity of our Faith, and for the Benefit of humane Society, the adorning, the Profession of Religion, and making us meet for eternal Life, seeing without Holiness no Man can see the Lord.</P>
<P>And the Assembly do seriously recommend to <HI>all Mini∣sters and Preachers</HI> of the Gospel, that in pressing moral Duties, or Obedience to the Law, they shew the Nature and Excellency of Gospel Holiness, and enforce Confor∣mity to the moral Law both in Heart and Life, not from Principles of Reason only, but also and more especially of Revelation. And, in order to attain thereto, it is necessary to shew Men the Corruption and Depravity of humane Nature by their Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> their natural Impotence for and Aversion to what is spiritually Good; and to lead them to the true and <HI>only Source of all Grace and Holiness, viz. Union</HI> with <HI>CHRIST,</HI> by the <HI>Holy SPIRIT's</HI> working <HI>Faith</HI> in us, and renewing us more and more after the Image of God: And to let their Hearers know that they must first be grafted into
<PB N="12" REF="005544_0011_10185B0A37552558"/>
Christ as their Root, before their Fruit can be savoury unto God; that they must have a new Principle to ani∣mate, and a new End to direct them, before their Actions become gracious and acceptable in the Sight of God: And that they teach them the Necessity of living by Faith on the Son of God, in a constant Looking to and Depen∣dance on Him, as the great Author of all gracious In∣fluences, for the Performance of every Duty: And withal, that after their best Performances and Attainments, they must count them but Loss and Dung in Point of Justifi∣cation before God; and make it their great Desire only ;to be found in Christ and his Righteousness.</P>
<P>And that <HI>Ministers,</HI> in the <HI>Application</HI> of their Ser∣mons, do endeavour rightly to divide the Word of Truth, speaking distinctly to such various Cases of the <HI>Converted</HI> and <HI>Unconverted,</HI> as arise natively from the Subjects they have been handling: And that in the whole of their Discourses, they take care to suit themselves to the Capa∣city of their Hearers, as to Matter, Method and Ex∣pression, and to the prevailing Sins of the Time and Place, with all prudent and zealous Freedom and Plainness: As also that they make <HI>Gospel Subjects</HI> their <HI>main Theme</HI> and <HI>Study,</HI> and press with all Earnestness the Practice of moral Duties in a Gospel Manner: And that they forbear delivering any Thing in Publick that may tend more to Amusement than Edification; and beware of bringing into their Sermons and publick Discourses Matters of doubtful Disputation, which tend to gender Strife rather than to promote the Edification of Christians. And the Assembly exhort all to study to maintain the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</P>
<P>And finally, the General Assembly recommends to all <HI>Professors of Divinity,</HI> to use their best Endeavours to have the <HI>Students</HI> under their Care, well acquainted with the true Method of Preaching the Gospel, as above di∣rected: And that <HI>Presbyteries</HI> at their privy Censures inquire concerning the Observation of this Act.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>Thus far that excellent ACT.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005544_0012_10185B0C2F9997B8"/>And as we are perswaded <HI>this Sort of Preaching</HI> is agreable to the main Design and Spirit of the Gospel; we cannot but apprehend <HI>this</HI> to be <HI>the most seasonable Time</HI> to recommend it, as the most likely way of guard∣ing from all Kinds of Errors and Extreams on the Left Hand and Right; in particular the <HI>Socinian, Antinomian,</HI> and <HI>Arminian;</HI> and of preserving both Truth and Piety with us; and earnestly wish that <HI>those great Gospel Truths,</HI> and <HI>this evangelical Way of Preaching</HI> were uni∣versally encouraged and promoted both by Ministers and People.</P>
<P>And as these are our serious Sentiments, Resolutions and Desires, as to the <HI>Doctrines of the Gospel;</HI> we wou'd freely &amp; earnestly invite <HI>all other Ministers,</HI> who <HI>heartily approve</HI> them, <HI>to unite with us</HI> in <HI>expressing their Appro∣bation of the same,</HI> both <HI>Those who are in the same Ap∣prehension</HI> with us in the <HI>late Revival</HI> and <HI>Those who are not;</HI> together with <HI>their Resolutions</HI> by the Grace of God to maintain and promote the said important Truths and Power of Godliness.</P>
<P>Upon the whole; as in all that has been said, we are far from imposing our Sentiments on others, as if we intended to exclude them from our Communion or Cha∣rity; so we are equally grieved to find some endeavour∣ing to pervert our Design, as if we aim'd at making <HI>new Creeds</HI> or Tests of Communion, and others suffer∣ing themselves to be impos'd upon by such an Abuse, which we trust they will be delivered from by this De∣claration. And as we apprehend, this Land is yet bless'd with as excellent a <HI>Ministry,</HI> for Learning, Soundness and Piety in general as any on Earth; we have Reason to fear there are <HI>groundless Separations</HI> from some, very offensive to Christ, dishonourable to his holy Religion and its late Revival among us: And we earnestly wish that all of every Party would with Self-Jealousy search their Hearts and Ways, humble themselves, turn to the Lord, and do their utmost to remove this and every other Scandal. We would also earnestly beg the dear
<PB N="14" REF="005544_0013_10185B119F42C6F0"/>
People of God, to beware of Separation and Alienation from <HI>Ministers</HI> as if they were not <HI>pious</HI> or <HI>orthodox</HI> meer∣ly because they are not in the same Sentiments with us in Respect to the late Revival, or see not Light to join with us in this Declaration; but exercise Charity towards them, without Prejudice hear them, and bear with their different Sentiments about those Matters, as every Christian ought, for the Honour of Christ and his Religion. And with Regard to <HI>such Ministers,</HI> we here take Occasion to declare our selves ready to join with them in any just Measures which may have a pro∣bable Tendency to promote the Kingdom of God our Saviour.</P>
<P>We conclude with Recommending the following Texts of Scripture to the serious Consideration both of Ministers and People on this Occasion.</P>
<P>Heb. x. 23. <HI>Let us hold fast the Profession of our Faith without wavering.</HI></P>
<P>Rev. iii. 3, 11. <HI>Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast, and repent: Behold I come quickly! hold that fast which thou hast, that no Man take thy Crown.</HI></P>
<P>Col. iii. 12—14. <HI>Put on Bowels of Mercies, kindness, Hum∣bleness of Mind, Meekness, Long-suffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another: If any Man have a Quar∣rel against any; even as</HI> CHRIST <HI>forgave you, so also do ye. And above all Things, put on Charity, which is the Bond of Perfectness.</HI></P>
<P>1 Pet. iii. 8, 9. <HI>Be ye all of one Mind, having Compassion one of another; Love as Brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: not rendring Evil for Evil, or Railing for Railing; but con∣trariwise, Blessing.</HI></P>
<P>Mat. v. 44, 45. <HI>Love your Enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you; that you may be the Children of your</HI> FATHER <HI>which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>2 Pet. iii. 17, 18. <HI>Ye therefore Beloved, seeing ye know these Things before, beware lest ye also being led away with the Error of the Wicked, fall from your own Stedfastness: But grow in Grace and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour</HI> JESUS CHRIST: <HI>To Him be Glory both now and for ever,</HI> AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>AS <HI>Divines,</HI> as well as <HI>Teachers</HI> in <HI>all other Sciences,</HI> in order to a more <HI>comprehensive</HI> Way of speak∣ing and writing, are obliged frequently to use <HI>many Terms</HI> which comprehend <HI>many Ideas</HI> that are commonly known among them; and as the <HI>General Assembly</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of SCOTLAND have accordingly made use of several such in THEIR ACT above-recited: it is at the Desire of the <HI>Ministers</HI> who bear this Testimony, that for the Information of the <HI>People</HI> in general, there is here added some Explication of several Terms therein expressed; and this in Order as they lie in THE ACT, as follows—</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>ATheism</HI> — From <HI>Atheists:</HI> who deny the Being or Per∣fections of GOD, or his Creation or Providence.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>Deism</HI>— From <HI>Deists:</HI> who tho' they believe the DEITY, yet deny the BIBLE to be given by divine Inspiration.</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>Arianism</HI> — From <HI>Arius</HI> an <HI>Egyptian:</HI> who denied the DIVINE WORD and SPIRIT to be of the same Nature, Substance or Essence with the FATHER, and held the Divine SON and SPIRIT to be created Beings.</P>
<P N="4">(4) <HI>Socinianism</HI>—From <HI>Socinus</HI> an <HI>Italian:</HI> who denied GOD's Omnisciency, the Deity of the SON and HOLY GHOST, original Sin, Election, the Satisfaction of CHRIST, the Imputation of his Righteousness to our Justification, the Operation of the HOLY SPIRIT in our Regeneration; and held that we must believe nothing but what our shallow and depraved Reason comprehends, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">(5) <HI>Arminianism</HI> — From <HI>Arminius</HI> a <HI>Dutchman:</HI> A System which holds</P>
<P N="1">I. That the Will of GOD to save such as <HI>believe</HI> and <HI>perse∣vere</HI> in <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> is the whole Decree of <HI>Election</HI> to Salvation: that there is one Election to <HI>Faith,</HI> another to <HI>Salvation;</HI> so that Election to <HI>justifying Faith</HI> may be without peremptory Election to <HI>Salvation:</HI> that <HI>the good Pleasure and Purpose of</HI> GOD whereof the Scripture makes mention in the Doctrine of Election, doth not consist herein,
<PB N="17" REF="005544_0016_10185B1E0C7FA560"/>
that GOD did elect some certain Men rather than others; but in this, that GOD from among all possible Conditions, did chuse as a <HI>Condition</HI> to Salvation, the <HI>Act of Faith</HI> in it self ignoble, and the <HI>imperfect Obedience of Faith,</HI> and was graciously pleas'd to repute it for <HI>perfect Obedience,</HI> and ac∣count it worthy of the Reward of everlasting Life: That peremptory Election of singular Persons is made by Rea∣son of <HI>foreseen persevering Faith, Repentance, Sanctity, and Godliness:</HI> that some who were elected <HI>may</HI> and <HI>do</HI> for ever perish: and that in this Life there is no Fruit, no Sense, <HI>no Certainty</HI> of immutable Election unto Glory.</P>
<P N="2">II. That GOD the FATHER ordain'd his SON to the Death of the Cross, without any certain &amp; determinate Counsel of saving any particular Man expresly: That CHRIST by his Satisfaction did not certainly merit for any Man <HI>Salvation</HI> and <HI>Faith;</HI> but only purchased to his FATHER a Power or plenary Good-will of treating a new with Mankind, and of prescribing them what new Conditions he pleased, the Per∣formance of which Conditions should depend on <HI>Man's free Will;</HI> and that therefore it might fall out that either no Man or every Man might fulfill them: That the <HI>New Covenant of Grace</HI> which GOD the FATHER, by the Me∣diation of CHRIST's Death, made with Men, doth not consist herein, viz. that we are justified before GOD and saved by <HI>Faith,</HI> as it apprehends the Merit of CHRIST; but herein, viz. that the Exaction of perfect legal Obedience being abrogated, GOD reputes <HI>Faith itself</HI> and the <HI>imperfect Obedience of Faith</HI> for <HI>perfect Obedience</HI> of the Law, and graciously thinks it worthy of the Reward of eternal Life; That all Men are received into the State of Reconciliation and Grace of the Covenant; so that no Body shall be con∣demn'd for <HI>Original Sin,</HI> nor in Respect of it be liable to Death or Damnation, but are all acquitted from the Guilt of that Sin: And whereas some, rather than others, are made Partakers of Forgiveness of Sins and Life eternal; that this Diversity depends on <HI>their own Free-Will</HI> applying itself to Grace indifferently offered, but not upon the <HI>sin∣gular Gift of Mercy</HI> effectually working in <HI>them</HI> rather than <HI>others,</HI> that they may apply this Grace unto themselves.</P>
<P N="3">III. That <HI>Original Sin</HI> is not of itself sufficient for the con∣demning all Mankind, or deserving temporal and eternal Punishment: That <HI>the Will</HI> of Man was never corrupted, but only encumbered by the Darkness of the <HI>Understanding</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="005544_0017_10181383E4AF8E48"/>
and Unruliness of the <HI>Affections:</HI> That an <HI>unregenerate</HI> Man is <HI>not properly, nor totally dead in Sins,</HI> nor destitute of all Strength tending to spiritual Good▪ but is able to hunger and thirst after Righteousness or everlasting Life, and to offer the Sacrifice of an humble and contrite Heart, even such as is acceptable to GOD: and that a <HI>corrupt and natural Man</HI> can so rightly use the Light of Nature, or those Gifts which are left in him after the Fall; that by the good Use thereof he may attain to saving Grace and by Degrees at length Salvation it self.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That in <HI>true Conversion</HI> there cannot be infused by GOD any new Qualities, Habits or Gifts into <HI>the Will</HI> of Man; and so <HI>that Faith</HI> by which we are first converted and from which we are styled Faithful, is not any Quality or Gift infused by GOD, but only an Act of Man: That the Grace whereby we are converted to GOD, is nothing else but a gentle Inducement perform'd by suasory Motives: That no Cause can be alledged why even such moral Grace alone should not of <HI>natural</HI> Men make <HI>spiritual:</HI> That GOD doth not produce the Consent of our Will otherwise than by Way of moral Suasion: That GOD in regenerating a Man, doth not employ that omnipotent Strength, whereby he may powerfully and infallibly bow and bend his Will to Faith and Conversion: and that in <HI>Conversion,</HI> Grace does not in order of Causality go before the Action of the Will; i. e. that GOD doth not effectually help Man's Will unto Conversion before the Will of Man moveth and determin∣eth or settleth it self thereto.</P>
<P N="5">V. That the <HI>Perseverance</HI> of the Faithful is not an Effect of Election, or any <HI>Gift of</HI> GOD purchased by the Death of CHRIST; but a <HI>Condition</HI> of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> which is to be perform'd on <HI>Man</HI>'s Part by <HI>his own Free-will</HI> before his peremptory Election and Justification: That the <HI>Rege∣nerate</HI> may not only totally and finally fall from justifying Faith, as also from Grace and Salvation; but that they do frequently fall from all These and perish eternally: That <HI>no Certainty</HI> of future <HI>Perseverance</HI> can be had in this Life, without special Revelation: That the Doctrine maintaining <HI>Assurance</HI> of Perseverance and of Salvation, is of its own Nature a soft Pillow for the Flesh, and hurtful to Godliness, good Manners, Praying, and other holy Courses; and con∣trariwise, that 'tis a very commendable Thing to be doubt∣ful of such Perseverance: That <HI>the Faith</HI> of those who be∣lieve
<PB N="19" REF="005544_0018_10185B1F924D41C8"/>
but for a Season, differs not from justifying and saving Faith, but only in Respect of <HI>Continuance:</HI> That 'tis not absurd that a Man should lose his <HI>first Regeneration,</HI> and be again and again Regenerate; and that CHRIST never prayed for Believers infallible Perseverance.</P>
<P>This is a <HI>Summary</HI> of the <HI>Arminian Errors</HI> described, con∣demned and refuted by the venerable and famous <HI>Synod</HI> of <HI>Dort</HI> in 1619. as contrary to the HOLY SCRIPTURES, as well as the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Reformed Churches.</HI></P>
<P>See <HI>Acta Synodi.</HI></P>
<P N="6">(6) <HI>Bourignonism</HI> — From <HI>Bourignon</HI> a popish enthusiastical Woman of <HI>Flanders:</HI> —who held that GOD has made Man's Will independent on Himself, that this is Man's principal Resemblance to GOD, and that GOD is ignorant of future humane Actions; that CHRIST had a Rebellion in his Na∣ture and Will against the Will of GOD; that GOD cannot save by the Merits of another; that the Innocent cannot suffer for the Guilty, that our LORD's Body could not suffer for the great Crimes of so many Persons; that 'tis a Falshood to think CHRIST fully satisfied for us, and an Er∣ror to expect Salvation fully from his Merits; that CHRIST subjecting Himself to Sufferings and becoming obedien<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to Death, was not the <HI>Price</HI> of our Redemption, but to give us an <HI>Example</HI> of Meekness and Patience under our Trials; that a meritorious Addition of our Repentance, Mortifica∣tion and good Works, is necessary to purchase our Salvation; that the Doctrine of the TRINITY is an Error; that there is no vindictive Justice in the divine Nature; that Prayer and hearing Sermons are needless to Salvation; that GOD has no eternal Decrees; that <HI>Man</HI> may be in a gracious State and yet apostatize and perish; and that <HI>her Writings</HI> are given by divine Inspiration, and are <HI>new holy Scriptures.</HI> And yet with all these horrible Errors she <HI>profess'd to believe the Bible.</HI> See <HI>Blackwell</HI>'s Ratio Sacra.</P>
<P N="7">(7) <HI>Popery</HI> — i. e. —the <HI>Popish Religion,</HI> held and enjoined by the <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Rome:</HI> comprehending the Worship of Angels, departed Saints, Relicks, Images and Crosses; the Doctrine of Justification by Works; of Saints deserving of God, for themselves and others, by giving or doing more than he commands them, called Works of Supererogation; as also Transubstantiation, Purgatory, Prayers for the Dead, and Prayers in an unknown Tongue &amp;c: denying the Bible to be the only Rule of Faith, Life and Worship; and deny∣ing
<PB N="20" REF="005544_0019_10185B21A0315D10"/>
the Laity the Libert<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to read the Bible, and of judging for Themselves in Matters of Religion: main∣taining that the <HI>Pope</HI> is Head and Lord of the universal Church, any has thy Power of appointing what deceased Saints shall be pray'd to &amp;c; that there is no other Church or Ministers of CHRIST but theirs on Earth; that <HI>their Clergy</HI> have the Power of forgiving the Sins of the Living, and of praying the Souls of the Dead out of Purgatory; that <HI>they</HI> have also the Power over the Faith, Worship and Consciences of all Men, and to persecute all who separate from them or disown their religious Practices or Doctrines; that they may do any Thing to promote their Religion; and that they ben't oblig'd to keep any Faith with Pro∣testants, or any others whom they call Hereticks &amp;c.</P>
<P N="8">(8) <HI>Superstition</HI> — is the adding any thing to religious Worship which GOD does not require.</P>
<P N="9">(9) <HI>Antinomianism</HI>— See the <HI>marginal Note</HI> in Page 5.</P>
