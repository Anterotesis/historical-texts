<HEAD>Religious Education of Chil∣dren Recommended.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PROV. XXII. Ver. 6.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Train up a Child in the Way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BLindness and Ignorance in Things of the highest Moment for us to know, is one of the greatest Miseries that can possibly happen to the Soul in this Life; for as Souls are design'd to live happy or miserable for ever, which Happiness depends upon the right Use of their Liberty; and that upon their Knowledge how to use and determine it; it will be impossible for them to attain eternal Happiness, or escape e∣ternal Misery, without Knowledge to steer, or direct them right.</P>
<P>From hence appears the great Importance of train∣ing up Children in the Ways of Vertue, that so early Custom may reconcile them to their Duty: And it is so much the more indispensibly necessary, because the Seducer is always at Hand to lead them aside.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004478_0004_100D538CA4E36BA0"/>
My Business therefore shall be, to enforce the good Work of training up Children in the Way they should go, for the important Reason intimated in my Text, that, <HI>when they are old, they may not de∣part from it.</HI></P>
<P>And shall then make an Application suitable to the Occasion of our present sorrowful Meeting.</P>
<P>First, I am to enforce the good Work of training up Children in the Way they should go, for the im∣portant Reason intimated in my Text, that, <HI>when they are old, they may not depart from it.</HI></P>
<P>I would not here be understood to suggest, that this general Rule admitted of no Exception; there have been, and will be again, Instances to the con∣trary: But such Instances are very uncommon; and it rarely happens, that such Persons totally and fi∣nally miscarry.</P>
<P>It is a great Advantage to Religion to have been seasonably planted in the tender Soil, and to have taken the first Possession: And Education has the most considerable, tho' not the only Share in our Tempers and Manners.—Children are very early capable of ill Impressions, and what is imbibed in Youth, is more lasting &amp; influential.—The human Mind is as prone to bring forth Error and Vanity, as the Earth is to bring forth Thorns and Thistles; for by Nature we are Children of Wrath, and by the earliest Practice Children of Disobedience. The I∣maginations and Thoughts of our Hearts, from our Youth up, are only Evil continually. It is a <HI>lively</HI> tho' <HI>dreadful</HI> Picture, which St. <HI>Paul</HI> gives of our natural State, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3. <HI>Ch.</HI> 16. 17 <HI>v</HI> That Destructi∣on and Misery are in our Ways, and the Ways of Peace we have not known. Yet these very Souls thus vitiated by Sin, are capable of being restored
<PB N="7" REF="004478_0005_100D53AF05333510"/>
and sanctified, and of being prepared to serve God graciously in this World, and to enjoy him in Glory in the World to come.</P>
<P>Shall such Souls then as these be thrown away? Are they to be let alone? Are no Means to be used to enlighten them, to turn them, and to deli∣ver them from their Folly &amp; Misery? The dread∣ful Consequences of such a Neglect, are worth our Consideration.</P>
<P>As has been already observed, we are naturally inclined to Evil; the neglect therefore of Education lays Children under a kind of Necessity of pursuing what they are by Nature inclined to; Sin and Vice become soon habitual to them; and when once these are grown familiar, there seems to be an End of Liberty and Choice; they are then for the most Part deaf to good Counsel and Instruction: or if they are disposed to hear, they want the Power to follow it, being bound in the Chains of their Sins, and led Captive by Satan, at his Pleasure. And when they are reduced to this Condition, their Ruin seems to be seal'd, and without a Miracle of God's Grace, are never to be reclaim'd. It fares with our Minds, as it does with our Bodies; They are supple and pliable in their first and early Years, easily bow'd and turned this way or that: but they grow fix'd and stiffen'd as they ripen into Age, then preserving the same Shape, Figure and Frame into which they had been first moulded. The very Dis∣position and Turn of Mind depends much upon it: and perhaps a great deal of what we call <HI>natural Temper,</HI> is little more than that particular Frame of Heart, which was first infused in our Education. This shews the Necessity of sowing the Seeds of Re∣ligion early in so tender a Soil, and the evil Conse∣quence of such a neglect.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004478_0006_100D538E2BA293F8"/>
How invaluable a Blessing then is it, to have been set right at first? How easily, I had almost said insensibly, may such arrive at the greatest Heights? They run thro' the Difficulties of a religious Course, without so much as feeling the Pain and Toil of it. Happy they who have been thus conducted through the Paths of Virtue! Who have never known what it is to have been captivated to Sin and Satan, never felt the weight of prevailing Lusts, corrupt Customs, or vicious Habits. How easily may they obtain a Crown? which must cost others dear, and be hardly gain'd, (if gain'd at all) after many doubtful Strug∣gles, many Sighs and Tears, many bitter Pains and Agonies of Mind.</P>
<P>To be then a Parent is surely a Concern of great Weight and Moment, every Child being a conside∣rable Charge intrusted with such by God: And al∣tho' Parents are not expresly named, yet are they necessarily implied and supposed in the <HI>Text,</HI> for all Acts must have their Agents, as well as their Ob∣jects. But what is hinted <HI>proverbally</HI> in my <HI>Text;</HI> is <HI>elsewhere</HI> more <HI>expresly declared,</HI> Deut. 6. Ch. 6. v. 7. <HI>Thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and thou shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy House, and when thou walkest by the Way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</HI> Nor is the <HI>Gospel</HI> in this particular less pressing than the <HI>Law. Fathers provoke not your Children to Wrath, but bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord,</HI> Eph. 6. Ch. 4. ver. (i. e.) In a literal Sense, bring them up in the <HI>Christian Religion;</HI> teach them their Duty, what they are to believe and practice; instruct them in the Knowledge of <HI>God,</HI> and of Jesus Christ; shew them in what Condition they are by <HI>Nature;</HI> and to what they are advanced by <HI>Grace;</HI> let them know, that without believing in Christ, they can
<PB N="9" REF="004478_0007_100D53B08DDEACA8"/>
reap no Benefit from his meritorious Undertakings; that without Holiness there can be no Happiness; and that therefore they must be careful to keep a good Conscience towards God and Man, and by a blameless Conversation to adorn the Doctrine of the Gospel. Above all, inform and endeavour to con∣vince them, that there is a Life after Death, where∣in Men shall receive from God, a mighty and eter∣nal Reward, or a terrible and endless Punishment, according as they have done, or neglected their Duty in this Life; and therefore urge it upon them as an undeniable Truth, that if they live unholy Lives, they shall die miserably; and that tho' their Lives be never so long and prosperous, yet if they die in their Sins, it would be better, far better for them they had never been born.</P>
<P>And as it is the Business of Parents, to instill into their Children's Minds the Principles of Religion; so should it be their Care, to frame their Lives ac∣cording to the Rules and Precepts of it: to train them up in the exercise of Obedience, and Modesty, of Diligence and Sincerity, of Tenderness and Hu∣manity, as the general Dispositions to Religion; to accustom them to the government of their Passions and Tongues, as the Foundation of it; and to inure them to the Practice of Piety &amp; Devotion towards God; of Sobriety and Chastity with regard to themselves, and of Justice and Charity towards all Men, as the principal Parts of it.</P>
<P>By conducting themselves in this manner, Parents no less consult their own Good, than that of their Children; for by this faithful discharge of their Duty, they secure to themselves some of the prime Blessings both for this World and the other; hav∣ing secured the refreshing Testimony of a well dis∣charged
<PB N="10" REF="004478_0008_100D5390EBBD6B10"/>
charged Conscience, so as to wash their Hands in innocency from the Guilt of sharing in their Chil∣dren's Sins, and Ruin, should they miscarry; and taking the most effectual Course of enjoying the unspeakable Blessing of good and dutiful Children while they live here; and of lying down at last in their Graves, with the transporting Hopes of meet∣ing them all again with endless Joys in Glory here∣after. Neither finally, will the <HI>Publick</HI> be less here∣by obliged: since Families are both Nursuries for <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> on the Management whereof their Happiness or Misery doth wholly depend; so that Men can in no other Way deserve better of Man∣kind, or become greater Benefactors to the World, than by training up their Children in the Principles of Vertue and Goodness.—Which is the Reason, why in <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Athens,</HI> and <HI>Sparta,</HI> and other well order'd Governments, a more especial Care was taken about the training up of Youth.—Without this, Men would grow wild and savage, unfit for Socie∣ty. Rebellions, Rapines, Murders, and other mon∣strous Impieties, are but the natural Fruits of deprav∣ed Nature, uncultivated by Education. But if Youth be wisely &amp; justly managed, how happy will its In∣fluence be upon Society, and what Blessings will it draw down from Heaven upon Men.—And Oh! happy the Children that have such Parents? And happy the Parents that thus take care of their Children?</P>
<P>But because Providence brings Children into ma∣ny other Dependencies and Relations in the World, and by various Ways cuts them off from the imme∣diate Care of their Parents; as by the Parents Death, or Distance from them, or by their Inabi∣litity or Unwillingness to instruct them; it is there∣fore incumbent on others, whether Masters or Go∣vernours,
<PB N="11" REF="004478_0009_100D53B2172FB6F8"/>
who have the Care of them, to provide Instruction for their Minds, as well as Food and Cloathing for their Bodies.—<HI>Abraham</HI> as the Head of the Family, has this honourable Testimonial from God himself; <HI>I know him, that he will command his Children, and his Houshold after him, and they shall keep the Way of the Lord,</HI> Gen. 18. Ch. 19. ver.—<HI>Joshua, Moses's</HI> Servant and Successor said, <HI>As for me, and my House, we will serve the Lord,</HI> Josh 24 Ch. 15. ver. The general Precepts of loving our Neigh∣bour as our Selves, &amp; of doing to others as we would they should do unto us, makes it necessary for all those who have the Care of Children, to train them up in the Way they should go.—And let this be a fur∣ther Motive towards promoting the Discharge of this Duty of Instruction, that the neglect of it will not only involve those concerned, in the Inconve∣niencies, Shame, and Sorrow of Children's Miscar∣riages, but in a great Measure in the Guilt of them. For certain it is, that Parents must be one Day ac∣countable for all their Neglects of their Children, in Matter of Instruction, Example, and Restraint from Evil.—And let me intreat all Masters of Families to be especially careful in the Particular of setting good Example; for there is small probability of Success, where there is a constant Contradiction be∣tween the Instructor's Precepts and his Practice. The Force of a President (as <HI>Experience</HI> convinces us) is vastly more prevalent, than that of Precept. And even Children will be more apt to follow a bad Example, than the best Instructions: Vain therefore will your Cautions against those Things be, which you practice your selves; vain will your Punishments be for the commission of them; when all your Arguments may be baffled with this single Question, <HI>Thou that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? How then will it make your Ears tingle,
<PB N="12" REF="004478_0010_100D53927415BD80"/>
when God shall arise terribly to Judgment, and say to you, Behold! the Children which I have given you; they were Ignorant, and you instructed them not; they made themselves Vile, and you restrained them not. Why did you not teach them at Home, and bring them to Church, to the publick Ordinances, and Worship of God, and train them up to the Exercise of Piety and Devotion? But you did not only neglect to give them good Instruction, but you gave them bad Example: And lo! they have followed you to Hell, to be an addition to your Torment there.</HI></P>
<P>Would not such a Charge as this make every Joint of you to tremble, would it not cut your Hearts, would it not strike you with Horror, to be thus reproached? I am not able to make so dread∣ful a Representation of this Matter, as it deserves, but I would awaken Parents to a Sense of their Duty, and terrify them out of this gross &amp; shame∣ful neglect, which too many are guilty of.</P>
<P>Let Parents then carefully administer, and Chil∣dren patiently and gladly receive Instruction, their future Interest depends upon it. And what is the Life of the Body compared with the Life of the Soul, or the Pleasures of Time compared with eternal Torments? And let me prevail on all, (who are not yet arrived to Years of maturity) to consider, that no Objections or Prejudices against a compliance, can be of equal Weight with the eternal Life or Death of your Souls. When Satan or Sinners, or your own Hearts would cause you to refuse Christ, and neglect Salvation; have this Answer to all their Pleas in readiness; My Life or Death, my eternal Happiness or Misery depend upon my re∣ceiving or neglecting Christ; If I have not Christ, I can't have Life; If I have no Grace, I can ne∣ver have Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004478_0011_100D53B4F8E82D20"/>
Since then you have precious and immortal Souls to be saved? Since you have Helps and Encou∣ragements which many others want? Is it not bet∣ter to be good and happy with a few, than to be wicked and miserable with a Multitude? Shall all the Care, Cost and Kindness of your Friends be lost, and your Souls undone for ever? Can all the Pleasures of Sin make amends for the Sorrows it will bring in the End; when you will be forced to mourn at the last, and to say, <HI>How have we hated Instruction, and our Hearts despised Reproof, and have not obeyed the Voice of our Teachers, nor inclined our Ears to them that instructed us?</HI> But before it comes to this, may the Lord incline your Ears that you may hear, and your Souls may live! <HI>Take fast hold of Instruction, let her not go, keep her, for she is thy Life.</HI></P>
<P>The Time will not permit me to prosecute this important Subject any further; I must break off the Thread of my Discourse, by intreating you to turn your Eyes to a miserable poor Creature, under the deepest Distress and Agony of Soul, from the consciousness of a mispent Life, and the certainty of her very near approaching Execution; reduced to this deplorable Condition, chiefly from a want of those Opportunities of Instruction, you so plen∣tifully enjoy: being heretofore instructed neither in the Doctrines of Faith, nor season'd with the Principles of pure Religion. This was the Scource of all her Misfortunes; an utter Insensibility or Ig∣norance of the Ways of living usefully in this World, or happily in another. May her untimely End in∣fluence you all to lay fast hold on Instruction; may her Example and Sufferings answer the Intention of the Law, and deter all viciously and wickedly dis∣posed Persons among you from incurring the like Condemnation.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="004478_0012_100D5394C938B3D8"/>
She is to die for concealing the Death of her Bastard Child, supposed to be murdered by her; and if so, the most unnatural Murder! But this Part of the Charge she denies, yet acknowleges her Sentence to be just, in as much as she neglected the necessary Means of it's Preservation.—Murder is a horrid Crime, and therefore punish'd by the Laws of most Nations with Death, because the Common-Wealth is deprived of an innocent Member, by one that is apparently pernicious.—But why should I at present upbraid or insult this poor Malefactor! She is convinced I trust of the heinousness of her Sins, and may her Preparation and Repentance avail her in the Day of the Lord.</P>
<P>My Business is to address my dull Hearers, to rouse them up to a Consideration of their own Ways, and (altho' their Consciences may acquit them of the Sin of Murder) to exhort them to inquire if there are not Sins of as damning a Nature, that they may be involved in.—What think you of Adultery, Fornication, Extortion? These triumph with great Security, are left unmortified and unsubdued, in fast possession of your Hearts, and in full sway there.—What think you of Malice, Envy, Slander, Detraction, Backbiting, Lying? These, my Bre∣thren, are Sins of the Flesh, and tho' not punished with a Gallows here, are reserved for God's eternal Judgment. St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, that <HI>they which do such Things, shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> It is dreadful to behold a poor miserable Sinner, in perfect Health, taking her Leave of the World, and all the Vanities of it: The uncommonness of the Sight strikes us with Horror, and shocks our very Nature. But upon Reflection, how is her Case more desperate than that of a forlorn wretch∣ed Sinner upon a Death-Bed? Nay the Advan∣tage
<PB N="15" REF="004478_0013_100D53B692DE0460"/>
is manifestly on her Side; for she has had some Time, and <HI>we trust</HI> Power, to make her Peace; the Death-Bed Penitent, neither Time, Power, nor Disposition: for to make a sincere Penitent, In∣dustry, Consideration, Strivings, and Contests with our selves, are required: And how unable and unfit is a Man for these Things, when he lies lan∣guishing on a Death Bed.—Were we not stupid and infatuated with the deceitful <HI>Charms</HI> of Sin, we should see our Danger, and whilst we have Strength of Body and Mind, Time, Opportunity, and Means of Grace, should secure our everlasting Happiness: We should wipe out our Sins by timely Repentance. Then cannot the evil Day come upon us unawares, whenever it comes.—When after any Miscarriage, we have reconciled our selves to God, we lie down in safety; and are in Security, tho' that very Night our Soul should be required of us.—Since then upon this short, this uncertain Life, depends our eternal Fortune in the next World, how infinitely doth it concern us to trifle no longer.—Methinks every Spectacle of Mortality, the sound of every Passing-Bell should alarm us.</P>
<P>But to return to the sorrowful Object before us.—Behold her then overwhelmed with Shame and Confusion of Face, lamenting her Ignorance, and bewailing her innumerable Commissions of Sin, and Omissions of Duty; which Way soever she casts her Eyes, she is presented with nothing but Horror. If she looks inwards, there she finds a Soul all over foul and leprous, oppressed with intollerable Loads of Guilt, and fill'd with the remembrance of a thousand Instances of Folly, and the ugliest Ingra∣titude—If she looks upwards, she sees an angry offended God, whose Laws she has affronted, whose Threatnings she has despised, whose <HI>Spirit</HI> she has
<PB N="16" REF="004478_0014_100D5397B732D818"/>
done despite to; whether shall she turn her, what's to be done in this deplorable State. With thee, O God! there is Mercy.</P>
<P>Run over then in thy Thoughts thy whole past Life, recollecting the many Mercies and Delive∣rances, that God has vouchsafed thee, acknowledg∣ing his Goodness with Praise and Thanksgiving. Then reflect on the great Miscarriages of thy Life; once more weep over thy old Sins, and again re∣pent of them with the uttermost Abhorrence and godly Sorrow that thou canst possibly affect thy Soul withal, to make up all thy former Defects. Then incessantly pray to God, that He would be with thee, and support thee, that he would increase and strengthen all thy Christian Graces, thy Faith, and Patience, and Hope, and Trust in Him, and that He would fill thee with all Joy and Peace in believing thro' the Power of the Holy Ghost.—Utterly renounce thine own Righteousness, and place all thy Hopes in the Mercy of GOD, thro' the Merits and Mediation of our Redeemer. Trust to the Merits of his Passion only for thy Salvation; for in Him only is thy Help found. Therefore by <HI>Faith look up unto Jesus, the great Propitiatory Sacri∣fice, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the Sins of the World</HI>—Then adore the divine Goodness, that has with such infinite Mercy to us, given Him to be the Propitiation for our Sins; and earnestly beg from the bottom of thy Heart God's Pardon for all thy Sins from thy Youth up, until now, (par∣ticularly that for which thou art shortly to suffer) in his Name, and for his Sake; humbly beseeching the God of all Grace and Goodness, that He who is in Christ reconciling the World unto himself, would for Christ's sake, be reconciled to thee, and receive thee to his Mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004478_0015_100D53B92B0F48F0"/>
Here is comfort for the sincere Penitent, (tho' miserable Sinner,) by the Stripes of Jesus he is healed, the Benefit of his Blood does not only reach the Righteous, and the Innocent; those that through a good Education, and a virtuous Disposition have, in a great Measure, escaped the Pollutions of the World, and have all their Lives long given up themselves to the Service of Jesus Christ; I say, it is not to these only, that the Mercies of the Gospel are extended; (tho' of all others these are the most happy People▪) but the Gate is open, even to the prodigal Children; those that have wasted all their Father's Substance in Lewdness and riotous Living; even these the Father is ready to receive with open Arms, if they can have but the Heart to return to him. Many Instances and Examples do the Scriptures of the Old Testament afford of those that have found Mercy from God, after their falling into sinful and grievous Crimes; as <HI>David,</HI> after his commission of Murder and Adultery; <HI>Solomon,</HI> af∣ter a Course of Debauchery and Idolatry; <HI>Ma∣nasses,</HI> after a long Life of horrid Impieties.—And sure the Gates of Repentance are as open in the <HI>New Testament,</HI> as the <HI>Old,</HI> under the <HI>Gospel</HI> as under the <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>I will not take upon me to say, which were the greatest Sins that ever were committed by Mankind; but I will Instance in two, that must needs be acknowledged to have been very great, which yet have obtain'd Pardon: and they are the Sin of our first Parents, and the Sin of the <HI>Jews</HI> in crucifying our Saviour.—In the latter of these Instances, besides the greatness of the Per∣son, against whom they sinned, (putting to Death the Lord of Life and Glory) there was design'd
<PB N="18" REF="004478_0016_100D5399DBAFBCF0"/>
Malice, Perjury, Subornation, Contumely, In∣gratitude, Contradiction to the plainest Evidence of Miracles of all Kinds, and to the Conviction of their own Consciences: And notwithstanding St. <HI>Peter</HI> exhorts the same Men to Repentance.—And our blessed Saviour himself apologizes for their Ignorance, <HI>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do:</HI> And <HI>the Scriptures bear them witness, that if they had known him, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory.</HI> This Igno∣rance is all the Extenuation the horror of their Crime was capable of.—And some Extenuation it always is, tho' in proportion less, as the Means of Knowledge are greater.—I would not here be understood to insinuate the Prisoner's Ignorance of the capitalness and wickedness of the Crime she is convicted of; I only apply it to some of the Actions of her past Life, for which she must account at the great Tribunal, as well as for this.</P>
<P>Further, altho' I can by no Means think the Case of the Labourers coming into the Vineyard at the eleventh Hour, nor that of the <HI>Penitent Thief</HI> upon the Cross to be exactly parallel with the Case of this condemn'd Malefactor; yet some Resemblance may be discovered; and these In∣stances may afford some Encouragement to her, whose Misfortune it has been to live a long Time in Ignorance and Sin.—In the Thief upon the Cross we have an Instance of a poor Wretch almost expiring; certain Death upon him, dying under publick Punishment for a very heinous Crime: And yet at the End of a Life, led pro∣bably after the Rate that theirs generally are, whose Wickedness at length brings them to an untimely End: This Creature is softned at once,
<PB N="19" REF="004478_0017_100D53BAD1AE13C8"/>
received into Favour, and promised a translation from a <HI>Gibbet</HI> into <HI>Paradise.</HI>—This certainly is a Monument of Mercy, a standing Comfort to all in the same Circumstances who truly repent, tho' at their last Hour.—For even they who have lain long in the Snares of the Devil, and thro' the Course of a whole Life, been taken Captive by him at his Will, shall like this reclaimed <HI>Thief,</HI> be rescued, accepted, rewarded; provided they like him return to God, and improve their ne∣ver so small remainder of Time to the best Ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>And this we trust is pretty near the Case of our poor condemned Sister; the Scales have fal∣len from her Eyes, and Streams of Tears gush'd out, the bitter, but wholsome Tears of Repen∣tance:—The Sincerity of which, tho' none but God that sees the Heart can certainly tell, yet Man also may, and ought to believe, not on∣ly in the Judgment of Charity, but of moral Practice, from all evident Signs of it, which are to be given by one in her Condition.—And tho' to forsake Sins then, when we can no longer en∣joy them, seems to be rather the Effect of Impo∣tency and Necessity, than of Choice, and there∣fore not so acceptable, or Praise-worthy; yet we find Almighty GOD often uses the one to bring about the other; and improves a forced abstinence from Sin, into a settled loathing and detestation of it.—So that I think we may charitably conclude, that her Condemnation, thro' the Grace of God has proved an effectual Means of a true, tho' late Repentance: And that if she has done all that possibly she could in that little Time that has been allow'd her; even this her Work shall not
<PB N="20" REF="004478_0018_100D539BACF48F68"/>
be lost; she shall be much happier than she de∣serves.</P>
<P>Grant we beseech thee therefore, O Heavenly Father, that she may End her Life in thy Fear and Favour, and that she may receive her Death, which is so very near at Hand, not as a <HI>Curse,</HI> but as a <HI>Deliverance.</HI>—</P>
<P>And I intreat you all here present to join with me in commending her Soul into the Hands of Almighty GOD, as into the Hands of a faithful Creator, and most merciful Saviour, humbly be∣seeching Him, that it may be precious in his Sight.</P>
<P>Lord, wash her Soul in thy Blood, that it may be presented without Spot unto thee. And let her die in thy Favour, and rest in Peace, and rise again in Glory.—Strengthen her O God! in her Agonies; as her Strength fails, let her Pains wear off. But when her Strength fails, let not her Faith fail; even in Death, let her Trust in thee. And the nearer she is drawing to thee, the more do thou manifest thy Mercy.—Lord Jesus have Mercy upon her! Thou Lamb of God that tak∣est away the Sins of the World, be merciful to this poor Sinner; perfect her Repentance, and accept it; blot out all her Mis Deeds, as thou engagest to do to all who sincerely repent of the same. Deliver her O Lord, from fear of Death, and from all violent Disorders of a troubled Fancy, or painful Delusions of her Ghostly Enemy. Let not him now be able to disturb or terrify her, or any way to prevail against her, but guard thou thy Servant.—Give thy Holy Angels charge to stand about her, to guard and receive her poor
