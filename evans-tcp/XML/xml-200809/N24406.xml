<P>BEFORE Sir HENRY ASHURST, SIR BEAU∣MONT <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>HAM, Sir JAMES MARRIOT, and others.</P>
<P>Sir JAMES MARRIOT, the Judge Advo∣cate, gave a short Charge to the Grand Ju∣ry, (chiefly stating the difference between the Maritime Law, and the common Law of the Land, with respect to <HI>Murder,</HI> there being, according to Maratime law, no such offence as Manslaughter,) who, after retiring a considerable time, returned with a true Bill against FRANCIS COLE, GEORGE COL∣LEY, MICHAEL BLANCHE and EMAN∣UEL BA∣THA, for the <HI>Wilful Murder</HI> of WILLIAM LITTLE, Captain of the American Eagle.</P>
<P>The Prisoners' Counsel desired the two last named prisoners might be tried by a Ju∣ry of half Foreigners and half Englishmen, they being Spaniards, which was granted by the Court; and the Court then procee∣ded to arraign the four prisoners, viz.</P>
<P>FRANCIS COLE, GEORGE COLLEY, MICHAEL BLANCHE, and EMAN∣UEL BATHA, <HI>who were indicted for that they not having the fear of God before their eyes, but being moved and seduced by the instigation of

<P>A second Count, <HI>for that they, on the same day and place, on the said</HI> William Little, <HI>felo∣niously, &amp;c. did make and assault; and that the said Francis Cole did then and there feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought, tie and fasten a certain rope to the body of the said</HI> Wil∣liam Little, <HI>and did then and there, by the said rope, haul and drag the said</HI> William Little <HI>from and out of the cabin of the said ship, to and upon the deck of the said ship; and that the said Fran∣cis Cole did then and there, with both his hands and arms, cast and throw the said</HI> William Lit∣tle <HI>from the deck of the said ship into the sea, and did thereby drown the said</HI> William Little, <HI>of which drowning he then and there died.

<P>The Indictment opened by Doctor AR∣NOLD:</P>
<P>And the Case by Sir WILLIAM SCOTT, as follows:</P>
<P>May it please your Lordship, and Gentle∣men of the Jury;</P>
<P>The indictment charges the prisoners a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the bar with the murder of <HI>William Little,</HI> and it is my duty to state to you, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall do to you as briefly as is consistent with perspecuity, the circumstances and facts at∣tending this case, as we purpose to lay them before you in evidence. The unfortunate person, whose death is the subject of the pre∣sent enquiry, was master of an American ves∣sel, called the <HI>Eagle,</HI> which set off the 15th of September, in the last year, with a cargo of tobacco, bound for France; the ship's com∣pany at that time, consisted of Capt. <HI>William Little,</HI> the deceased, and ten other persons, of whom three died, very shortly after the ves∣sel quitted the harbour; there were left on board the master, and seven other persons, the two prisoners at the bar, the two Span∣iards,
<PB N="7" REF="032308_0006_0FF1BC8667C6E450"/>
whom you have seen produced at the bar, and three other persons, who will be produced to you as witnesses, in support of this prosecution. Gentlemen, nothing mat∣erial occured, in the prosecution of this vo∣yage till on the 27th of October last; when at twelve o'clock at night, <HI>Little,</HI> the master, and three other persons on board, that will be produced as witnesses, went below to sleep; on being relieved from their watch by the two prisoners at the bar, and the two Spaniards. Gentlemen, on that night we charge that the destruction of this unfortu∣nate person, was effected, in the manner de∣scribed in the indictment; and we charge the prisoner at the bar, Cole, with being the hand employed in this murder; and the prisoner, Colley, with being the direc∣tor, and the chief actor in this mur∣derous conspiracy against him, and the two Spaniards with being aiding, abetting, assisting, comforting, and maintaining, the said Cole and Colley, to commit the said murder. Gentlemen, the body of this un∣fortunate person, after the murder was ef∣fected, was dragged on deck, and afterwards thrown over board. The manner in which this foul transaction came to the possession of the other witnesses on board the ship, for you will please to observe there were no o∣ther witnesses of the transaction, but those engaged in it; several of the conversations that passed between the prisoners and the witnesses, I shall leave to be detailed by them, and the other, as the persons engaged in
<PB N="8" REF="032308_0007_0FF1BC885A9BFB30"/>
this business are tried separately. It appears to me, that many of those transactions, and of those conversations, which I should oth∣erwise have stated, as composing the general history of this business, would be rather in∣applicable, on account of this separation, in which the prisoners are brought to the bar; it will however, not be improper for me to state to you, that in the morning after the murder had taken place, one of the prison∣ers at the bar assembled the men toge∣ther; that he then told them, they would go into the first port <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey could reach, and sell the cargo, and divide the profits amongst them; he went down and took passession of 245 dollars, which were in the deceased's chest, and afterwards divided the deceased's clothes among the crew, some of which were cut in a variety of places; and Col∣ley, the mate, entered in the Logg-Book, that he deceased on the 27th of October, of a yellow fever; the ship arrived at the Isle of Wight; after which it will be proved, that the prisoner Colley attempted to make an alteration of the entry of the death he had recorded before, and stated, that the de∣ceased's death happened at a former period; he there disposed of the dollars for forty-five guineas, and divided among the crew, five guineas each; this circumstance of the entry of the death of the deceased, and oth∣er particulars, which appeared of a mysteri∣ous nature, various and inconsistent repre∣sentations of the cause of his death, excited suspicions in the mind of the American
<PB N="9" REF="032308_0008_0FF1BC8BAD1DE570"/>
Agent and Consul; and these representati∣ons being further investigated, they ter∣minated in the discovery I have stated to you. Gentlemen, the Lords of the Admi∣ralty have, nevertheless, thought it a duty which they owed to general justice, to in∣stitute an enquiry into this business, and to commit it to the judgment of a jury; and you will discharge your duty, by pronoun∣cing that verdict on the prisoners at the bar which your consciences shall warrant you to form.</P>

<P>Did both the Spaniards take the watch? —Yes Sir.</P>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> Are these two of the men you saw on the watch?—Yes, both of them.</P>
<P>Were there any persons on board, when you left the watch besides the four that suc∣ceeded to the watch?—No Sir.</P>
<P>Who were the men that were there?—
<PB N="11" REF="032308_0010_0FF1BC94DE917850"/>
One of them is named George Colley, and the other Frank Cole.</P>
<P>Where did the captain and the other 3 go when they went off the watch?—The gen∣tleman stood in the companion way. I stood and talked to him two or three mi∣nutes: the other men went to lay down.</P>
<P>What other men?—Cassada and Hart went down; the captain went into his ca∣bin, and I went into the steerage. I went and turned myself into sleep.</P>
<P>How was the captain when you parted with him, in health?—In as good health as I am.</P>
<P>What happened afterwards?—About one I awaked and heard murder <HI>shrieked</HI> out, it startled me very much.</P>
<P>Did you distinguish his voice?—It was the captain's, I laid a minute, and I heard him <HI>sing</HI> out for George Colley.</P>
<P>Who did you hear call out for George Colley?—It was captain Little. I heard Colley's voice in the companion, calling out <HI>rub him.</HI></P>
<P>What did you understand by that?—I do not know; I did not know what it was; I thought we had just struck soundings, and he had fallen off deck. Then I heard the captain say, "I am not dead, tho' you think I be."</P>
<P>Repeat the words you heard the captain say?—The captain said, "I am not dead tho' you think I be;" then the captain said to Frank Cole, "let me lay down and
<PB N="12" REF="032308_0011_0FF1BC96656F2910"/>
die." The words were "Frank let me lay down and die."</P>
<P>Who did he say that to?—To Frank Cole.</P>
<P>How do you know that the captain said that to Frank?—I heard the captain's voice say, "Frank, let me lay down and die."</P>
<P>But how do you know he said that to Frank Cole?—He either said Frank or Cook, I do not know which.</P>
<P>Who was Cole?—He was cook.</P>
<P>Could you see any thing on board?—No.</P>
<P>Was it light or dark?—It was dark.</P>
<P>What distance were you from Cole &amp; the Captain?—About twelve feet.</P>
<P>Then you have not been speaking from what you saw, but from what you heard of the sound of voices and conversation?—Yes.</P>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> Did the sound come from the place where the captain's cabin was?—The sound came out of the cabin.</P>
<P>It sounded to you to come out of the ca∣bin?—Yes. Then it was all still. Then I saw a light in the cabin.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor General.</HI> Was there any in∣terval between the time when you saw a light in the cabin and when you heard the captain say, "Cook let me lay down and die?"—That was afterwards. I saw a light in a few minutes. I could hear a noise and the people stirring.</P>
<P>After you saw the light. what happened? —After the light was gone, directly a man came down into the steerage where I laid.</P>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> Who was that man?—I could not swear to the man.</P>
<P><PB REF="032308_0012_0FF1BC9B0D5E4978"/>
Had he a light with him? —No; Hart said, "What is the matter on deck, is there a squall sprung up? then he went on deck and returned.</P>
<P>What did Hart do?—Hart put on his jac∣ket and then he went on deck.</P>
<P>What happened next?—Then I was awake for a few minutes, then I heard a noise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the cabin.</P>
<P>What sort of noise did you hear in the cabin?—I heard people stir. I heard as tho' they were dragging something up the steps, up the companion steps that lead to the cabin.</P>
<P>What did you do all this while?—I laid still.</P>
<P>Why did you lay still?—I laid still to see what would become of them.</P>
<P>What happened next?—They dragged the noise over my head, right over me upon the deck.</P>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> You mean they dragged something the noise of which you heard up the steps? —Yes.</P>
<P>What happened next?—Then it was all still.</P>
<P>How long?—A minute or two; then there was a man came down from the com∣panion and sat by the side of me in the steer∣age, on a hogshead, then there was a lan∣thorn lowered down.</P>
<P>Did you distinguish who that man was? —Yes, as the lanthorn was lowered down I turned to my right side, and he bid me
<PB REF="032308_0013_0FF1BC9E261D89B0"/>
turn back again, which I did, but still the light shone so, that I could see who it was.</P>
<P>Who was it?—It was Michael Blanche; then he began to haul off his stockings and shoes as tho' he was going to turn in, be∣cause I was awake; then he beckoned and the lanthorn was hauled down again, then he put out his hand and took up a spike a∣bout a foot long, a marline spike.</P>
<P>What is the marline spike made of?—Iron.</P>
<P>What did he do with this marline spike? —He put it into his left hand, and put it back again, then he brought it within about three inches of me; I had my hand laid so; I warded it off with my right hand, and took hold of it with my right hand, and took it from him, then I took him by the throat and stamped upon him, and I came on deck; and there were four men.</P>
<P>Who was on the deck?—George Colley, these two Spaniards, and Frank Cole.</P>
<P>What, did Michael go on deck before you? —No, this Archibald Hart was called on deck before; the other man that was on deck was Emanuel.</P>
<P>When did Michael come up?—Just after me, Cassada came up with me.</P>
<P>Now repeat who were the four on deck when you first went up, and who came after∣wards?—One was George Colley, Frank Cole, Emanuel the Spaniard, and Archibald Hart. When I went on deck, I said, what in the name of God, does all this mean? Did you want to take a fellow's life when he is in sleep? Then George Colley made answer
<PB N="15" REF="032308_0014_0FF1BCA13306BA98"/>
and several more of them, what is the mas∣ter! what is the matter! I knew their voi∣ces that said it. I said, before you shall take my life, give me a fair chance, I will take a plank and walk overboard, for I know the transaction as well as you do. Then Colley said, there is no need of it, for the Captain is gone.</P>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> What did he mean by that, the Captain is gone?—The Captain is gone o∣verboard. The others spoke, but I cannot recollect what the words were; but Colley said, if I did as they did, I should fare well. I cannot recollect the words, but I take it that was the meaning.</P>
<P>Can you recollect the words he made use of?—I cannot.</P>
<P>Do you recollect Michael saying anything? —Michael said I should not be <HI>starboon,</HI> mea∣ning true to them.</P>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> You do not undertake upon your∣self to say what Colley said?—No.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Solicitor.</HI> Did Colley say any thing, when Michael said that?—He talked Span∣ish to him. Colley said, he would not hurt me; I cannot recollect the words that Col∣ley said.</P>
<P>What did Michael Blanche say?—That I should not be <HI>starboon.</HI></P>
<P>Did you understand the meaning of <HI>star∣boon?</HI>—One of them told me afterwards.</P>
<P>Who told you?—That was John Cassada.</P>
<P>Was Colley present when that was ex∣plained to you?—I do not know.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="032308_0015_0FF1BCA2C4AB1D38"/>You had a conversation with Colley?— Yes.</P>
<P>Do you recollect what passed in that con∣versation?—No sir, I do not.</P>
<P>When John Cassada came on deck, what condition was he in?—He was in his shirt sleeves, only just a waistcoat on.</P>
<P>Did he say any thing?—I cannot tell what it was; then I saw blood lay on deck.</P>
<P>Did yet see blood any where else?—Ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, on the <HI>Cummin</HI>; on the piece of wood by the door, and likewise the steps.</P>
<P>What steps?—That lead to the cabin.</P>
<P>Did you go into the cabin?—Not then, not till the afternoon; then I saw blood laying in the cabin, and likewise in the state room, and I saw this Michael Blanche wash∣ing the blood away before that; but some of it was in; Michael was washing it away before I went down; the chest was unlock∣ed, and the key laying on the floor among the dirt; we all helped to overhaul the chest, except one at the helm.</P>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> You say the chest had been un∣locked?—Yes; we looked over the chest, and found 245 dollars in silver.</P>
<P>Who were present, when the chest was opened?—All the crew, except one at the helm, that was one of the Spaniards.</P>
<P>What was done then? Then the money was taken out, and George Colley put it in∣to his chest.</P>
<P>Did any thing pass before this was done? No; after that, some cloathes were divided on the deck.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="032308_0016_0FF1BCA469F633E8"/>Had every man his share? George Col∣ley did not take any then, they took it all a∣mong them.</P>
<P>Did they divide it themselves, or did any body divide it for them? They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook them up and divided them.</P>
<P>How came these things to be divid∣ed? —I do not know. The next thing I found was a pair of trowsers in the steerage, a∣bout two days afterwards, they were all full of blood.</P>
<P>Did you know the trowsers▪—Yes; and on the left thigh there were three places cut in them; and in the private parts of the trowsers there were two more; and in the waistband there were two more; the waist∣band was cut half off in one place.</P>
<P>Do you know whose trowsers they were?— Yes Sir, they were the Captain's. They were dussil, the only pair that were on board.</P>
<P>Have you ever seen the Captain in them? —Yes. He had them on three or four days back, and the very day before.</P>
<P>What became of the trowsers?—This Mi∣chael cut them up; they were too big for him, to make them smaller.</P>
<P>Did you find any thing besides the trow∣sers?—Yes, a knife.</P>
<P>Do you know whose knife this was?— Colley's. I had killed a pig; he had lent me the knife; I cleaned it, and returned it to him.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="032308_0017_0FF1BCAA91CB1978"/>What become of that knife?—Geo. Col∣ley threw it overboard.</P>
<P>In what condition was that knife, when you found it?—Bloody.</P>
<P>How did Colley become possessed of it, when he threw it overboard?—I cannot justly say, I know I saw him throw it over∣board.</P>
<P>What did he say, when he threw it over∣board?—He said this is the knife that did the very job.</P>
<P>Did he say what job?—No, he said, "this is the damned knife that did the job."</P>
<P>What else?—An entry was made in the Log-Book; Colley got in liquor before this, and he told me to bring the Log-Book and put it in; I made the entry myself at first,</P>
<P>Look at this, <HI>(shows him the Log-Book.)</HI>— Is that the Log-Book?—Yes.</P>
<P>Whose hand writing are the entries of the 24th, 25th and 26th of October?—These are George Colley's.</P>
<P>Have you ever seen George Colley write? Yes, I have seen him write a little; I have seen him write in that book.</P>
<P>Look on the 27th of October?—This is not my writing, it is his writing.</P>
<P>Look at the entry of the 28th of Octo∣ber, the next day▪—That is not mine.</P>
<P>Did you see either of these entries made? —Yes, I saw him scratch out one, and make another.</P>
<P>Then you did not see the entry made on the 27th?—I did, it is not my hand writ∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="032308_0018_0FF1BC750D84DC78"/>Did you see the entries as they are now scratched out?—Yes, here is one of them scratched out, and carried back sixteen days, it there said, he died of a yellow fever.</P>
<P>Who did that?—George Colley.</P>
<P>What was the entry that was altered?— It was the death of <HI>William Little.</HI></P>
<P>You saw the entry made by Colley, car∣rying the date back, and entering that he died of the yellow fever? Was that so?— Yes.</P>
<P>When was that entry scratched out?—I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Where was it?—At the bottom.</P>
<P>How did that entry originally stand?— scratched there, what was that?—I cannot read writing.</P>
<P>Try at the place where it is scratched?— Here it is.</P>
<P>Well, what is it?—I cannot make any thing out of it.</P>
<P>Can you read the entry of the next day; how do you know the entry was put back? —I can read some, but I cannot spell; I can read an easy word now and then.</P>
<P>Is there any of your entry in it?—I kept the Log-Book in November.</P>
<P>Did you see that Log-Book scratched by any body?—Yes, I do.</P>
<P>Who scratched it?—George Colley.</P>
<P>When was it?—I cannot say,</P>
<P>At what place?—In the cabin.</P>

<P>Did he say any thing to you when he gave you the money?—I am sure I cannot tell you justly whether he did or not, be∣cause there were many people in the room, and there was no word to one or another in particular.</P>

<P>You know the fact to be false, that he did not die of a fever?—Oh I am sure of that.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding which you entered it yourself?—Yes, I entered it myself.</P>
<P>Can yon read?—I can read some easy place, but I cannot spell any at all, when I come to a hard word.</P>

<P>But your two mess-mates?—I never saw them write.</P>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> Was you sitting down by Colley at the time he made that alteration in the book? —Yes.</P>
<P>How do you know that he altered it so as to give it a prior date?—I saw him take a pen knife and scratch out something, and write in a former part of the book, carrying it back.</P>

<P>Those were the words?—Yes.</P>
<P>Why you wrote it, you know it was in two places; upon your oath which did you write?—That I cannot tell.</P>

<P>If you look into the book there are no entries of the Captains death, because all that relates to the Captain is scratched out.</P>

<P><HI>Court.</HI> You have looked at that entry of the 28th of October of the burial; is that your hand writing?—If any is my hand writing that is.</P>
<P><HI>Counsel.</HI> You went to bed the 27th of October, and laid in the steerage with two other men;—What signifies your <HI>bothering</HI> me, I told you once.</P>
<P>I will tell you why, because the Jury do not know so much of you as I do; you went down stairs and slept in the steerage with Cassada and Hart;—I have told you once.</P>
<P>Turn your face to the jury.</P>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> You must answer all the questions that are asked?—But when I have told the story two or three times, I do not know what is proper.</P>
<P>Now you went down into the steerage in company with Cassada and Hart?—They went down before me.</P>
<P>How far was you from the captain?—A∣bout twelve feet.</P>
<P>You was alarmed with the ery of mur∣der?—Certainly I was.</P>
<P>It was dark?—Yes.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="032308_0028_0FF1BCCCF14C7008"/>Then you might have got up unobserved? —Yes.</P>
<P>How came you to lay so quiet when you heard the cry of murder?—If you or any other person was in that situation you would lay quiet too.</P>
<P>Why you had two friends in the steerage with you?—No Sir; yes there were two after the man was dead, he was hauled up.</P>
<P>No, no, there was Cassada and Hart in the steerage with you: you heard the cry of murder and you heard the captain <HI>sing out</HI> which I suppose mean, call out in your lan∣guage?—I heard him <HI>sing out.</HI></P>
<P>That means calling out?—Yes calling.</P>
<P>You never attempted to get up?—After Colley said rub him, I got up, I had been up once and lay down again.</P>
<P>Upon your oath, why did not you alone get up?—Why did not I, a man does not know what to do.</P>
<P>Why there were three of you in the steer∣age, and the captain was within twelve feet of you?—Ye, and there were two bulk heads between us.</P>
<P>And neither you nor Cassada nor Hart went to his assistance?—They two did not hear me, I did not know they were there▪ I was lying thinking what to do.</P>
<P>You did not awake them because you did not know they were there, did you try to awake them, why, you told us they went down there with you to watch?—Yes.</P>
<P>You never attempted to ask either of these
<PB N="30" REF="032308_0029_0FF1BCCE9BFB6FD8"/>
men to go to your assistance?—How did I know but they were called up before.</P>
<P>Did you try to see whether they were or not?—I did not.</P>
<P>At that time when you first heard it, you heard the voice of one man that was attack∣ing the Captain?—He was the only voice I heard speak out then, I heard only the cap∣tains voice in the Cabin, speaking to some∣body in the Cabin, Colley was on deck.</P>
<P>Then there was one man in the Cabin? —I do not know there was any more; I heard him say Frank, let me lay down and die quietly, I did what I supposed was best, then Hart was awaked and he went up up∣on deck, I do not know who awaked him; I never spoke nor stirred.</P>
<P>Did Hart call you when he was touched? —He only sald what is the matter, is there a squall upon deck; he never said a word to me.</P>
<P>Was there any light?—No, I concluded he was touched by <HI>singing out,</HI> I could not see the man's face, but I could see he had no shoes nor hat on, I could not swear to the mans backside, he turned his face from me.</P>
<P>Now after this you was afraid that some of the Spaniards would do you a mischief, and you said you would got a plank and walk overboard?—Certainly.</P>
<P>And Colley said there is no need of that, the Captain is gone?—Yes.</P>
<P>That quieted you at once?—It quieted me so that I made up to him.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="032308_0030_0FF1BCD32F9146D0"/>Wight?—I was a young fellow on board, I acted as second mate when the captain was alive, to give him a call as any other man would, I was not so good a seaman as some of them.</P>
<P>How came you to take seven guineas and a half of this money, when the others had on∣ly five?—There were forty guineas, the o∣thers had only five.</P>
<P>How came that?—I do not know.</P>
<P>You asked no questions?—No.</P>
<P>You took the seven guineas and a half? —It was put in my hand.</P>
<P>Did you refuse it?—I did at first, but I took it afterwards.</P>
<P>Then you gave an account of the death of the Captain?—I had it in black and white before that.</P>
<P>And you swore to it?—I swore to what was true, to the best of my knowledge.</P>
<P>What you swore, then, was true, to the best of your knowledge, was it? do not say that I do not understand you?—Yes.</P>
<P>When you made affidavit at the Isle of Wight, what was in that paper was true, to the best of your knowledge?—Yes.</P>
<P>Then you swore at the Isle of Wight, that the captain died of a yellow fever?—Did I swear so?</P>
<P>Did not you?—Is it in that paper so?</P>
<P>Did not you make an affidavit at the Isle of Wight, that your Captain died of a yel∣low fever?—I do not know; I know I went there, it was on account of the cargo.
<PB N="32" REF="032308_0031_0FF1BCD4B57D2938"/>
oath of something? did not you there swear, that the captain died of a yellow fever?—I do not know that his name was put in there, that he died of a yellow fever.</P>
<P>Will you swear it was not?—I will not swear about it.</P>
<P>Will you swear that you and Cassada did not swear that he died of a yellow fever?— I cannot swear I swore so; if I did, I did not understand it, it was not to my know∣ledge at least.</P>
<P>Did you not all three swear positively, that the Captain met with his death on the voyage, and that he died of the yellow fe∣ver?—I do not remember it, it was about the cargo that we went.</P>
<P>Did you go to the Custom-house at all, or to the Isle of Wight, or Portsmouth?—I went to each of them.</P>
<P>At which of them did you take oath?— At both; one was concerning getting the vessel out of quarantine, and the other was about the cargo.</P>
<P>Now, in which of them did you swear the Captain died of a yellow fever?—It is in neither of them.</P>
<P>Will you swear it is not?—I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Did not you attend to what you swore? —I did not understand it.</P>
<P>Was not it read over to you?—Yes; that may be I might not understand that word, that the Captain died of a yellow fever.</P>
<P>Will you swear it was not giving an ac∣count of the captain's death at all?—I will
<PB N="33" REF="032308_0032_0FF1BCD6464B9A50"/>
not swear it was not there; I will not swear any thing about it.</P>
<P>Was not it read to you?—Did not I tell you it was read to me? I told you it was read to me.</P>
<P>Was it read to you?—Yes.</P>
<P>You signed it; did not you put your mark to it?—What if I did? I signed two papers there, one at Portsmouth, &amp; the other at the Isle of Wight.</P>
<P>But which of them contained an account of the Captains death, you do not know?— I do not know that either of them did.</P>
<P>Will you swear they did not?—I cannot swear any thing about it.</P>
<P>Then the Captain's death made no impres∣sion on you at all?—I was afraid of my own life at Cowes, they would all have turned against me.</P>
<P>You was afraid of your own life at Ports∣mouth?—Yes, I was.</P>
<P>Do you mean to swear, that, tho' you was on shore at Cowes and at Portsmouth, yet you was so afraid of your life, that you did not give any account of it?—I was a stranger.</P>
<P>Now, as to this knife of Colley's, he lent it to you?—Yes.</P>

foot and gave me a shake, and awaked me, and said, Arche! Arche! twice.</P>
<P>Did he say any thing else to you?—Not then Sir; I said, Oh, oh,</P>
<P>Did he say nothing else but merely call you at that time?—No Sir.</P>
<P>And what did you do in consequence of being called, did you lay still or get up?— Being drowsy I did not get up the first call, he called me a second time, then I got up &amp; came up to the gang-way and asked them if there was a signal upon deck, why, says he, "Yes, come up as quick as you can." I put on my jacket and shoes and hat, and went up and asked him what the matter was, and says he, "By G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the captain is killed, and the cook has killed him."</P>
<P>Do you recollect who were upon deck at the time that Colley made that answer to you?—Yes, Michael and Emanuel the little Spaniard, and Cole.</P>
<P>Had he any further conversation with you on the death of the captain?—Yes, he as∣ked me if I would help to haul him up out of the cabin?</P>
<P>What was your answer?—I told him no, I could not.</P>
<P>Then was he hauled up as you refused to help?—Yes Sir, he was hauled up by the two Spaniards and the cook.</P>

there?—Yes Sir, Colley, he spoke Spanish to them, and they took hold of the rope and hauled him up.</P>

Says Colley, "Never do you mind, Arche," says he, "for it is the making of us, I can carry the ship into any port, and then sell the ship and cargo."</P>
<P>Did he say where he would carry the ship to; Did he say any thing further to you? —He said he would run her into the first port he came to, and after we get in, says he, after the cargo is sold, we will sell the ship and divide the money; the men shall have their parts.</P>

<P>State what it was; state every thing that passed between Colley and Cole, respecting Dearborn?—Colley spoke to Cole, and says, cook, go and call Dearborn upon deck; says the cook, says he, what shall I do about calling him on deck, that will not do.</P>

not have men enough to carry in the ship into any port.</P>
<P>Did Colley say any thing further to you? —Says he, we must do something with the <HI>Long Bugger,</HI> for now day-light is coming on.</P>
<P>What did you do next, then?—Colley spoke to one of the Spaniards in Spanish, the Spaniard goes down below, that was Michael, about two minutes after that Dear∣born, he <HI>sings out,</HI> and wanted to know what he had done to the men on board, that they were going to murder him, Dearborn was then come upon deck, I saw him come up∣on deck; the cook came up to him, says he, what is the matter? says Dearborn you know what is the matter; I was standing on the starbord side, and Dearborn came to me, says he, Archy, says he, be you against me, too?

</SP>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> Were any of the prisoners on deck at the time of this conversation?— Cole and Colley were on deck.</P>
<P>Were they within hearing?—Yes.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="032308_0039_0FF1BCEF5549DFF8"/>
<HI>Mr. Alley.</HI> Did Colley understand this? Colley was at the helm.</P>
<P>Then was it possible he could distinctly hear what was going forward?—I can't say.</P>
<P>Could the cook hear?—Yes, Sir, the cook did hear.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. Battine.</HI> What answer was made to you?—He was talking to me, it was their intent to kill him; after that Colley said to me, Damn your eyes, what are you talking about there, come here; I was talking to Dearborn, and I made him no answer. Then Dearborn went to Colley and asked him what the Spaniard was going to kill him for; says Colley, I do not know what they were going to murder you for; they owed you some spite or another, but I cannot tell what. Says Dearborn, rather than they should kill me, I will take an oar, or a piece of plank, and I will go over board; one of the Spaniards called to know what he was talk∣ing about? Colley said something to the Spaniards, I cannot tell what; then the Spaniard comes round to Dearborn and says you are no <HI>starboon</HI>—says Colley, Dearborn you take the helm, there shall none of them hurt you.</P>
<P>Now when you saw Dearborn jump on deck, where was Michael at that time?— He came up immediately after Dearborn.</P>
<P>Did you observe any thing pass at the time when Dearborn and Michael came up? —No.</P>
<P>After it became light in the morning did you make any observation on the vessel?—
<PB N="41" REF="032308_0040_0FF1BCF296084240"/>
Yes, there was a great deal of blood on the quarter deck, from the break of it to the gangway of the cabin.</P>
<P>Did you see any thing particular in res∣pecting Cole's hand?—Yes Sir, his hand was cut very bad.</P>
<P>Did Cole tell you how he came by that cut?—Yes, he said the Spaniard Michael cut him.</P>
<P>Did he tell you how he cut him?—He told me that he drew a knife through his hand, and he went to jerk the knife from him.</P>
<P>After the Captain's death, what was done with his chest, clothes and things?—The next day after he was murdered, Colley went down and overhauled them all, I was present and saw him, he looked at them, and took out of one corner of the chest a bag of dollars, 245 dollars, some of them were for dividing the money, they did not take it then, they put it in again; says Colley let it be till we get into some port, before we divide it, Colley locked the chest, I do not know who had the key; the ship after∣wards arrived at the Cowes. After I had been there fourteen or fifteen days, five gui∣neas were given me by Colley.</P>
<P>Did any body else receive any to your knowledge?—Michael, Cole, and John Cas∣sada.</P>
<P>In short all the crew received money?— Yes.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="032308_0041_0FF1BCF5AB1FE2F0"/>
<HI>Dr. Battine.</HI> What became of the trow∣sers afterwards?—The cook Cole put them away for himself, the last time I saw them was. one of the Spaniards had them on, that was Manuel, he took them one day from the starboard side of the ship &amp; wash∣ed them.</P>
<P>Had you ever any conversation with Cole, respecting the Captain's death;—He told me he killed him with a tea kettle.</P>
<P>State what Cole said to you and the words he made use of respecting the tea kettle, state the whole of the conversation that passed between you and Cole, respecting the tea-kettle?—Says he "I did not quite kill him and I took a glass bottle and hit him over his head."</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Knowlys.</HI> At this time it was not light when you came out of the steerage?—No.</P>
<P>You and Dearborn and Cassada laid in the steerage together, did you not?—Yes, about two or three feet separate.</P>
<P>You might put out your arms and touch each other?—Yes.</P>
<P>Dearborn knew you was there very well? —Yes.</P>
<P>Did he attempt to disturb you in the night?—No.</P>
<P>When Colley came to the mouth of the steerage and called you, you knew very well who it was?—I thought it was his voice first, the second time he called, I knew his voice.</P>
<P>Dearborn is just as familiar with his voice as you are?—Yes.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="032308_0042_0FF1BCF73274B7B0"/>Afterwards he said Arche, Arche, there is a squall upon deck?—Yes.</P>
<P>Dearborn could have heard it or any oth∣er man?—I do not know, I stopped to put on my outside jacket and coat and shoes; Dearborn did not say a word.</P>
<P>How much time would it take to go to each Cabin?—A minute or a minute and a half.</P>
<P>You received no alarm from Dearborn at all in the course of the night?—No.</P>
<P>Did you tell Dearborn what had passed between Colley and you?—No.</P>
<P>All that about killing Dearborn did you communicate that to Dearborn?—No.</P>
<P>Never told him of that from that time to this?—No Sir, not that I know of, I told him of that when we were in Cowes.</P>
<P>But not till you arrived in Cowes?—No.</P>
<P>That was a week after?—It was as soon as we came to anchor.</P>
<P>Dearborn and you were good friends?— Yes, I did not want to make a noise one way or another.</P>
<P>When you got to Cowes, you never told about the murder of the Captain?—Yes.</P>
<P>How long was you at Cowes without speaking of it?—I cannot tell.</P>
<P>I will tell you, when you was taken up? —Yes.</P>
<P>Did you speak a word of it to any body till you was taken up?—No Sir, I did not.</P>
<P>How many days were you on shore before you was taken up?—Fourteen or fifteen days.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="032308_0043_0FF1BCFA47132840"/>Perhaps when you was taken up you was told that some body else had given informa∣tion?—Yes.</P>
<P>You knew the murder had come out?— I was told so.</P>
<P>And then and not till then you told your story?—Yes.</P>
<P>Did you receive any thing from the dol∣lars?—No Sir, I received nothing but five guineas.</P>
<P>That is something tho'?—Yes Sir, it is something.</P>
<P>How much had Dearborn?—Five gui∣neas.</P>
<P>Did you see the money paid to Dear∣born?—No Sir I did not see it.</P>
<P>What did he tell you?—He never told me, I never asked him, Cassada told me he had five guineas.</P>
<P>What part of the Captain's clothes had you?—Colley gave me a waistcoat, a pair of stockings, and one shirt of the captain's.</P>
<P>Then Colley I suppose distributed the clothes in shares to the different men?—Yes I was standing by and saw it done.</P>
<P>Dearborn was by too?—Yes.</P>
<P>What share of the clothes did Dearborn receive;—I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Did you see him receive any?—I did not.</P>
<P>Now if any body had sworn that, that was not so, and that Cole did not distribute any clothes that must be false?—Yes.</P>
<P>You stood by and saw it, and Dearborn too?—Yes, I and Dearborn and Cassada went to Portsmouth on Sunday.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="032308_0044_0FF1BCFBDC6CDEE8"/>How long after you came on shore?—It might be thirteen or fourteen days after the quarantine was out.</P>
<P>Then Dearborn told you that he gave ac∣count of the captain's death on shore, before it was found out that he was murdered; that he made an affidavit that the captain died of the yellow fever?—Yes.</P>
<P>When did Dearborn tell you that, how long before you was taken up that he made that affidavit?—I cannot tell you how long it was, but it was something about a week.</P>
<P>I take it for granted, that there was some sweet conversation as this passed between you, did not you tell him what a wicked scoundrell you must be to swear so?—No Sir, Colley took it down.</P>
<P><HI>Court.</HI> What did he say to you, did he particularly tell you what he had sworn, and that he had made an affidavit?—He said it was put in the log book, that he died of a yellow fever.</P>
<P>Did Cassada tell you what he had sworn too, when he went with Dearborn?—No.</P>

the prisoner Cole told you he killed him with the tea kettle?—Yes.</P>
<P>Who was by at the time the prisoner Cole told you of this transaction?—Nobo∣dy was by.</P>
<P>Upon your oath man, do you not know, did not you expect when you was taken up that you would be prosecuted unless you could fix it upon another?—I cannot tell you more than this.</P>
<P>Turn about Sir, and let the gentlemen see you, did you or did you not?</P>
<P><HI>(No answer.)</HI></P>
<P>Answer me, shall I repeat my question to you?—Yes I do not understand you.</P>
<P>I ask you upon your oath did you not know and expect when you was taken up that you would be prosecuted unless you could fix it upon another, and then be ad∣mitted as king's evidence against them; do you understand me now?—Yes.</P>

<P><PB REF="032308_0047_0FF1BD081EC3EA60"/>Now when you went on deck who did you see on deck?—There were all hands on deck besides me, I asked what is the matter here, some body answered, I asked what is it o'clock, they said three, I said then it is not my watch, I will go down below and take another nap; I went below, and when I went on deck again I saw the ship was bra∣ced wrong, and going another course; then Michael said to me the Captain is dead, he is overboard, I asked which way the captain came by his death, then he told me that Frank Cole had killed him.</P>
<P>Were Colley and Cole on deck at that time?—Yes.</P>

<P>Was Cole by?—No, Michael said to me the cook had killed the captain, then I went to ask of Cole, he said Michael did it, when I asked for my life, Colley said nobody should hurt me.</P>
<P>What did Michael say to you when you asked him to spare your life?—He said the same as Colley said, that no body should hurt me.</P>
<P>Did you observe Cole's hand?—Yes, I saw it out; I asked him how he came by it,
<PB N="49" REF="032308_0048_0FF1BD0BB4ABBBF0"/>
he said Michael cut it; then I asked Michael what was the reason he cut Cole's hand, and Michael said no, he cut it himself. Then this Michael went down below and washed out all the blood away.</P>
<P>Did you see the blood before it was wash∣ed away?—Yes.</P>
<P>Where was it?—About the stairs, all o∣ver the ladder; then Mr. Colley came be∣low and unlocked the captain's chest. I was the cook then, because Frank Cole could not cook.</P>
<P>Did you see Colley on deck?—He said to me, we will go into the first port we can make and sell the cargo, and divide the mo∣ney amongst all of us. He told me he found 245 dollars. I know he found them in the captain's chest; he did not say where.</P>
<P>What became of the captain's clothes?— I do not know; Mr. Colley gave me two shirts, two pair stockings, and a waistcoat. He gave them among all of us. Then I saw one jacket, I was very cold, and I took it myself and a waistcoat; then Colley told me he should charge me a guinea and a half for it. I took the clothes, but another day when we were at quarantine, I wanted to give them back again; he took a piece of rope and gave me a blow. He asked me what is that to any body, nobody has any thing to do with that. He took the clothes, and I was obliged to hold my tongue. He said to me, nobody has any thing to do with these clothes, they belong to nobody. When
<PB N="50" REF="032308_0049_0FF1BD1043026A90"/>
I went to ask for a shirt then Colley gave them me back again.</P>
<P>Was there any money divided among you?—Yes, Colley gave us five guineas a piece. I received five guineas.</P>
<P>Where had Colley got that money?— He changed it out of the dollars, I reckon∣ed so, he did not tell me so; we had five guineas a piece; what Dearborn and Mr. Colley had, I do not know, I was before the mast; the two Spaniards and the two blacks had five gvineas a piece as well as me.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Alley.</HI> Then I understand you, you went to bed at twelve?—Yes.</P>
<P>You slept till three?—Yes.</P>
<P>Then Michael was the first that told you of the captain's death?—Yes.</P>
<P>You asked Michael for your life, and he and Colley said, you should not receive any injury?—Yes.</P>
<P>Michael went below and washed out the blood?—Yes.</P>
<P>You got some of the deceased's clothes from Colley?—Yes.</P>
<P>You are sure the clothes of the captain's were delievered by Colley?—Yes.</P>
<P>Then if Mr. Dearborn has stated that he and the rest helped themselves, he must have stated what is false?—I do not know what that means.</P>

<P>That was very ill-natured, very bad con∣duct of Colley?—Yes.</P>
<P>You did not offer to return these things till you had kept them two or three weeks, and then when you was coming to shore, that none of the captain's clothes should be found on you, you were desirous to return them?—Yes.</P>
<P>You went on shore at Cowes and Ports∣mouth?—Yes.</P>
<P>You know in the affidavit made by Dearborn, it is sworn, among the rest, that the captain died of the yellow fever?—Yes, I heard so; I was very sorry for the cap∣tain's death.</P>
<P>As soon as you was taken up for murder, you said you would give an account of the transaction?—Yes.</P>
<P>Did not some captain of another ship came to your ship before you came on shore?—They did; we took the command∣er on board; we were then discharged.</P>
<P>How long was it after then that you were all taken up?—The next night; I cannot say to a certainty.</P>
<P>You never gave any account of this transaction till you was taken into custody? Yes. I am a stranger and know nothing of these things.</P>
<P>Where did you come from to give evid∣ence here?—From America.</P>

<P>Did you know his situation at that time? —The ship remained fourteen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ays at qua∣rantine. Then I ordered him to come to Cowes.</P>
<P>After the ship had arrived at Cowes did you see the prisoner Colley?—Yes Sir, he came to me on shore immediately.</P>
<P>State to the Court what conversation you had with the prisoner Colley?—I asked him the situation of the ship, and he told me that the captain and several of the men had died of the yellow fever, and also that the ship was leaky and would require caulkin.</P>
<P>In what situation did Colley represent himself to be?—He said he had been estab∣lished the mate of the ship by the captain, after the death of the chief mate, and then the captain dying, he wished now to suc∣ceed; my reply was, that as he was an ut∣ter stranger to the business, it was too much to be established the captain; that he should be the chief mate of the ship, and as the care of the cargo was of such a magnitude, his being a total stranger was too much to expect. He said, that as he had possession of the ship he should keep it.</P>
<P>Did he say he would keep possession of every thing beside the ship;—He had sent me down the ship's papers, but said he

would not be dispossessed of the command, I told him we should oblige him to deliver it up, as I had another person to take the command of the ship, I never asked him a∣bout the log book or any of the papers at that time.</P>
<P><HI>Mr. Common Serjeant.</HI> The first informa∣tion you received of this Vessel arriving at Cowes, was from the commander of the vessel at that time?—From Colley himself.</P>

<P>Before he was taken up?—Yes.</P>
<P>That is before you paid the men; had you any conversation with him or them a∣bout the death of the captain?—Only with Dearborn; I was sitting by the fire with an American gentleman, and looking at the log book I turned to the 2d of October.</P>
<P>Did any of the three men that were at your house when you was paying them their wages, Dearborn, Cassada or Hart, except Colley hold any conversation with you a∣bout the death of the captain?—No, I hap∣pened to look at the log of the 2d of Octo∣ber, and there I saw that the Captain had struck a porpoise, Dearborn told me when I said a man that died of a yellow fever could not kill a porpoise, Dearborn said he did not die of a yellow fever; he died of a <HI>short consumption.</HI></P>
<P>You certainly would not have paid them if you had thought any thing amiss?—No.</P>

<P>Sentence was immediately passed by Sir JAMES MARRIOTT, on the prisoners at the Bar. Francis Cole and George Colley, you have been tried by the laws of this country, for taking away the life of a fellow-creature —for which offence you have had a very fair trial, and are to be hanged on Monday next, at <HI>Execution Dock,</HI> and afterwards dis∣sected and anatomized.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="032308_0055_0FF1BD2170102360"/>The Court adjourned at 8 o'clock to the next morning, Saturday, Jan. 23, 1796, at 10, when the Judges, and the rest of the Court, being assembled as before, the two Spaniards, MICHAEL BLANCHE &amp; EMA∣NUEL BATHA, were indicted as before, for the Wilful Murder of WILLIAM LIT∣TLE.</P>
<P><HI>An Interpreter was sworn.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Mr. Knowlys,</HI> one of the Counsel for the prisoners, waived their right to be tried by a Jury of half Foreigners, and another En∣glish Jury were sworn, the former being all challenged by the prisoners' Counsel.</P>
<P>The case was opened by Sir WILLIAM SCOTT, similiar to his speech on the former Trial.</P>
<P>The three witnesses, Samuel Dearborn, Archibald Hart, and John Cassada, were then respectively examined, and gave evid∣ence to the purport as before, except that Dearborn said, on his cross-examination, he had been praying night and day while they were at quarantine, that the matter might come to light, but yet he never mentioned it to any person; and upon being particu∣larly asked, if he did not swear that the captain died of a yellow fever, he said, he would not swear about that or the subsequent account he gave to the consul of his dying of a <HI>short consumption</HI> only, that if the former was so down in the book, it was so; and if the Consul said he said a short consumption to him, then that was so also.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="032308_0056_0FF1BD24ECF01AC8"/><HI>Mr. Jalgoo,</HI> the American Consul, was ex∣amined, to the effect narrated in the form∣er trial, and asserted over and over, that Dearborn never, at any time, and when a∣lone with him, mentioned a sylable of the captain being murdered.</P>
<P>The evidence being finished, and the pri∣soners called on for their defence—Michael said he was innocent; and Manuel deliver∣ed in a paper, translated from Spanish, which was read as follows:—"I, Emanuel, declare before God. that I am innocent of having any share whatever in the death of Captain LITTLE. I was at that time at the helm, and could not have concerted with any one, as I cannot speak English at all, and my lan∣guage is that of the Bay of Biscay."</P>
