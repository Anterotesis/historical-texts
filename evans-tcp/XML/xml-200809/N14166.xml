<P>Man is considered as an inhabitant of the <HI>na∣tural</HI> world, and his fall is proved by arguments deduced from the misery, in which he is now un∣deniably involved; compared with the happiness, of which we cannot help conceiving him possessed, when he came out of the hands of his gracious Creator.</P>

<HEAD>THIRD PART.</HEAD>
<P>Man is considered as a citizen of the <HI>moral</HI> world, a free agent, accountable to his Creator for his tempers and conduct; and his fall is farther de∣monstrated by arguments drawn from—<HI>XII.</HI> His commission of sin.—<HI>XIII.</HI> His omission of duty.— <HI>XIV.</HI> The triumphs of sensual appetites over his in∣tellectual faculties.—<HI>XV.</HI> The corruption of the pow∣ers that constitute a <HI>good head;</HI> the understanding, imagination, memory, and reason.—<HI>XVI.</HI> The de∣pravity of the powers which form a <HI>good heart;</HI> the will, conscience, and affections.—<HI>XVII.</HI> His manifest alienation from God.—<HI>XVIII.</HI> His ama∣zing disregard even of his nearest relatives.—<HI>XIX.</HI> His unaccountable unconcern about himself.—<HI>XX.</HI> His detestable tempers.—<HI>XXI.</HI> The general out∣breaking of human corruption in all individuals.—

<HEAD>FOURTH PART.</HEAD>
<P>Man is considered as an inhabitant of the <HI>Chri∣stian</HI> world, and his fallen state is further proved by six scriptural arguments, introduced by a short de∣monstration of the authenticity of the scriptures, and by a little attack upon the amazing <HI>CREDULITY</HI> of Deists. The heads of these arguments are—<HI>XXXI.</HI> The impossibility that fallen, corrupt Adam, should have an upright, innocent posterity; with answers to some capital objections.—<HI>XXXII.</HI> The spirituality and severity of God's law, which the unrenewed man continually breaks;—<HI>XXXIII.</HI> Our strong pro∣pensity to unbelief, the most destructive of all sins ac∣cording to the gospel.—<HI>XXXIV.</HI> The absurdity of the
<PB N="viii" REF="017930_0006_0FA37E33F9F25DA8"/>
Christian religion with respect to infants, and strict moralists;—<HI>XXXV.</HI> The harshness and cruelty of Christ's fundamental doctrines; and—<HI>XXXVI.</HI> The extravagance of the grand article of the Christian faith; <HI>if</HI> mankind are not in a corrupt and lost estate.</P>

<P>The doctrine of man's fall being established by such a variety of arguments; first, a few <HI>natural in∣ferences</HI> are added: secondly, various <HI>fatal conse∣quences</HI> attending the ignorance of our lost estate; thirdly, the <HI>unspeakable advantages</HI> arising from the right knowledge of it.</P>
<P>The whole is concluded with an <HI>ADDRESS</HI> to the serious <HI>Reader,</HI> who enquires what he must do to be saved.—And with an <HI>APPENDIX,</HI> concerning the evangelical harmony, that subsists between <HI>living faith,</HI> and <HI>loving obedience.</HI></P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN religious matters we easily run into ex∣tremes. Nothing is more common than to see people embracing one error, under the plau∣sible pretence of avoiding another.</P>
<P>Many, through fear of infidelity, during the night of ignorance and storm of passion, run against the wild rocks of superstition and enthu∣siasm; and frequently do it with such force, that they <HI>make shipwreck of the faith,</HI> and have little of <HI>godliness</HI> left, except a few broken pieces of its <HI>form.</HI></P>
<P>Numbers, to shun that fatal error, steer quite a contrary course: Supposing themselves guided by the compass of reason, when they only fol∣low that of prejudice, with equal violence they dash their speculative brains against the opposite rocks of deism and profaneness; and fondly con∣gratulate themselves on escaping the shelves of fanaticism, whilst the leaky bark of their hopes is ready to sink, and that of their morals is per∣haps sunk already. Thus, both equally over∣look sober, rational, heart-felt piety, that lies between those wide and dangerous extremes.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="017930_0008_0FA37E357809B018"/>To point out the happy medium which they have missed, and call them back to the narrow path, where Reason and Revelation walk hand in hand, is the design of these sheets. May <HI>the Father of lights</HI> so shine upon the Reader's mind, that he may clearly discover truth, and notwith∣standing the severity of her aspect, prefer her to the most soothing error!</P>
<P>If he is one of those, who affect to be the warm votaries of Reason, he is intreated to be a <HI>close</HI>-thinker, as well as a <HI>free</HI>-thinker; and with carefull attention to consider Reason's dic∣tates, before he concludes, that they agree with his favourite sentiments. He has, no doubt, too much candour, not to grant so equitable a request; too much justice, to set aside <HI>Matter of fact</HI>; and too much good sense, to disregard <HI>an Appeal to common sense.</HI></P>
<P>Should he incline to the opposite extreme, and cry down our rational powers; he is desired to remember, <HI>Right Reason,</HI> which is that I ap∣peal to, is a ray of <HI>the light that enlightens every man who comes into the world,</HI> and a beam of the eternal <HI>Logos,</HI> the glorious <HI>Sun of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>God, far from blaming a proper use of the noble faculty, by which we are chiefly distin∣guished from brutes, graciously invites us to the exercise of it: <HI>Come now,</HI> says he, <HI>and let us rea∣son together.</HI> Jesus <HI>commends the unjust steward,</HI> for reasoning better upon his wrong, than the children of light, upon their right principles. Samuel desires the Israelites to <HI>stand still, that he may</HI> REASON <HI>with them before the Lord.</HI> St. Pe∣ter charges believers to <HI>give an answer to every
<PB N="xi" REF="017930_0009_0FA37E36B2D35270"/>
one, that asketh them a</HI> REASON <HI>of their hope.</HI> And St. Paul, who <HI>reasoned</HI> so conclusively him∣self, intimates, that <HI>wicked men are</HI> UNREA∣SONABLE; and declares, that a total dedication of ourselves to God is <HI>our</HI> REASONABLE <HI>service:</HI> And, while he challenges the vain <HI>disputers of this world,</HI> who would make jests pass for proofs, invectives for arguments, and sophistry for rea∣son; he charges Titus to use, not merely <HI>sound speech,</HI> but, as the original also means, SOUND REASON, <HI>that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then, following his advice and exam∣ple, pay a due regard both to reason and revela∣tion: So shall we, according to his candid di∣rection, break the shackles of prejudice, <HI>prove all things; and,</HI> by divine grace, <HI>hold fast that which is good.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN APPEAL TO MATTER OF FACT, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST PART.</HEAD>
<P>IN every religion there is a principal truth or error, which, like the first link of a chain, necessarily draws after it all the parts, with which it is essentially connected. This leading principle, in Christianity distinguished from De∣ism, is the Doctrine of our corrupt and lost estate: for if man is not <HI>at variance</HI> with his Creator, what need of a <HI>Mediator</HI> between God and him? If he is not a <HI>depraved, undone</HI> crea∣ture, what necessity of so wonderful a <HI>Restorer</HI> and <HI>Saviour</HI> as the Son of God? If he is not <HI>in∣slaved</HI> to sin, why is he <HI>redeemed</HI> by Jesus Christ? If he is not <HI>polluted,</HI> why must he be <HI>washed in the blood of</HI> that immaculate <HI>Lamb?</HI> If his soul is not <HI>disordered,</HI> what occasion is there for such
<PB N="14" REF="017930_0011_0FA37E37BAA9D280"/>
a divine <HI>Physician?</HI> If he is not <HI>helpless</HI> and <HI>mi∣serable,</HI> why is he perpetually invited to secure the <HI>assistance</HI> and <HI>consolations</HI> of the Holy Spirit? And, in a word, if he is not <HI>born in sin,</HI> why is a <HI>new birth</HI> so absolutely necessary, that Christ declares with the most solemn asseverations, <HI>without it no man can see the kingdom of God?</HI></P>
<P>This doctrine then being of such importance, that genuine Christianity stands or falls with it; it may be proper to state it at large; and as this cannot be done in stronger or plainer words, than those of the sacred writers, and our pious reformers; I beg leave to collect them, and pre∣sent the reader with a picture of our natural estate, drawn at full length by those antient and masterly hands.</P>
<P N="1">I. Moses, who informs us, that <HI>God created man in his own image, and after his likeness,</HI> soon casts a shade upon his original dignity, by giving us a sad account of his fall. He represents him after his disobedience, as a criminal under sen∣tence of death; a wretch filled with guilt, shame, dread and horror; and a vagabond, turned out of a lost paradise into a <HI>cursed</HI> wil∣derness, where all bears the stamp of desolation for his sake. Gen. iii. 17. In consequence of this apostacy he died, and <HI>all die in him: for, by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned</HI> in him, who was all mankind seminally and federally collected in one individual. 1 Cor. xi. 22. Rom. v. 12.</P>
<P>The sacred historian, having informed us how the first man was corrupted, observes, that <HI>he be∣gat a son in his own image,</HI> sinful and mortal like himself; that his first-born was a murderer;
<PB N="15" REF="017930_0012_0FA37E3878A582B8"/>
that Abel himself offered sacrifices to avert divine wrath, and that the violent temper of Cain soon broke out in all the human species. <HI>The earth,</HI> says he, <HI>was filled with violence—all flesh had cor∣rupted its way—and God saw the wickedness of man was great in the earth,</HI> so great, <HI>that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil, continually.</HI> ONLY <HI>evil,</HI> without any mix∣ture of good: And CONTINUALLY, without any intermission of evil. Gen. vi. 5.</P>
<P>When the deluge was over, the Lord himself gave the same account of his obstinately rebelli∣ous creature. <HI>The imagination of man's heart,</HI> said he to Noah, <HI>is evil from his youth,</HI> Gen. viii. 21. Job's friends paint us with the same colours: One of them observes, that <HI>Man it born like the wild asses' colt:</HI> And another, that <HI>he is abo∣minable and filthy, and drinks iniquity like water.</HI> Job xi. 12. and xv. 16.</P>
<P>David doth not alter the hideous portrait: <HI>The Lord,</HI> says he, <HI>looked down from heaven upon the children of men; to see if there were any, that did understand, and seek God.</HI> And the result of the divine inspection is: <HI>They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: There is none that doth good, no not one.</HI> Ps. xiv. 2. Solomon gives a finishing stroke to his father's draught, by in∣forming us, that <HI>Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child,</HI> and not of a child only, for he adds, <HI>The heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and while they live, madness is in their heart.</HI> Prov. xxii. 15. Eccl. ix. 3.</P>
<P>Isaiah corroborates the assertions of the royal Prophets, in the following mournful confessions: <HI>All we, like sheep, have gone astray—We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags.</HI> Isa. liii. 6. and▪ lxiv. 6.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="017930_0013_0FA37E393AEBA9F8"/>Jeremiah confirms the deplorable truth, where he says: <HI>The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond; it is graven upon the tables of their hearts.—O Jeru∣salem wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayst be saved.</HI>—For <HI>the heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: Who can know it?</HI> Jer. iv. 14, and xvii. 1.9.</P>
<P>Thus the Prophets delineate mankind in a na∣tural, impenitent state. And do the Apostles dip their pencil in brighter colours? Let them speak for themselves. The chief of them in∣forms us, that <HI>the natural,</HI> unrenewed <HI>man re∣ceives not the things of the Spirit of God,</HI> and that <HI>they are foolishness to him.</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 14. And he lays it down as matter of fact, that <HI>the carnal mind,</HI> the taste and disposition of every unrege∣nerate person, <HI>is</HI> not only averse to goodness, but ENMITY itself <HI>against God,</HI> the adorable fountain of all excellence. A blacker line can hardly be drawn, to describe a fallen, diabolical nature. Rom. viii. 7.</P>
<P>Various are the names, which the Apostle of the Gentiles gives to our original corruption; and they are all expressive of its pernicious na∣ture, and dreadful effects. He calls it empha∣tically <HI>Sin,</HI> a sin so full of activity and energy, that it is the life and spring of all others:—<HI>In∣dwelling Sin,</HI> a sin which is not like the leaves and fruits of a bad tree, that appear for a time, and then drop off; but like the sap that dwells and works within, always ready to break out at every bud:—<HI>The body of Sin,</HI> because it is an assemblage of all the members which constitute the human frame:—<HI>The law of sin,</HI> and <HI>the Law in our members,</HI> because it hath a constrain∣ing
<PB N="17" REF="017930_0014_0FA37E39F990BD78"/>
force, and rules in our mortal bodies, as a mighty tyrant in the kingdom which he hath usurped:—<HI>The old man,</HI> because we have it from the first man, Adam; and because it is as old as the first stamina of our frame, with which it is most closely interwoven:—<HI>The flesh,</HI> as being propagated by carnal generation, and always opposing the Spirit, the gracious prin∣ciple, which we have from Adam the second:— And <HI>Concupiscence,</HI> that mystic Jezebel, who brings forth the infinite variety of <HI>fleshly, worldly,</HI> and <HI>mental lusts, which war against the soul.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are St. James and St. John less severe than St. Paul, upon the unconverted man. The one observes, that his <HI>wisdom,</HI> the best property naturally belonging to him, <HI>descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, and devilish:</HI> And the other positively declares, that <HI>The whole world lieth in wickedness.</HI> James iii. 15. 1 John v. 19.</P>
<P>Our Lord, whose spirit inspired the Prophets and Apostles, confirms their lamentable testi∣mony. To make us seriously consider sin, our mortal disease, he reminds us, that <HI>The whole have no need of a Physician, but they that are sick.</HI> Luke v. 31. He declares, that <HI>men love darkness rather than light.</HI> That <HI>the world hates him</HI>; and that <HI>its works are evil.</HI> John iii. 19. and xv. 18. and vii. 7. He directs all to pray for the <HI>pardon of sin,</HI> as <HI>being evil,</HI> and <HI>owing ten thousand talents</HI> to their heavenly creditor. Mat. vi. 12. vii. 11. xviii. 24. And he assures us, that <HI>the things, which defile the man, come from within</HI>; and that <HI>out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an
<PB N="18" REF="017930_0015_0FA37E3ABB5FB500"/>
evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness,</HI> and, in a word, ALL MORAL EVIL. Mark vii. 21. Mat. xv. 19.</P>
<P>Some indeed confine what the scriptures say of the depravity of the human heart, to the aban∣doned Heathens and persecuting Jews; as if the professors of morality, and christianity, were not concerned in the dreadful charge. But if the apostolic writings affirm, that Christ <HI>came not to call the righteous, but</HI> SINNERS; that <HI>he died for the</HI> UNGODLY; and that <HI>he suffered, the just for the</HI> UNJUST; it is plain that, unless he did not suffer and die for moral men and christians, they are by nature <HI>sinners, ungodly,</HI> and <HI>unjust</HI> as the rest of mankind. Rom. v. 6. 1 Pet. 3.18.</P>
<P>If this assertion seems severe, let some of the best men that ever lived, decide the point, not by the experience of immoral persons, but by their own. <HI>I abhor myself,</HI> says Job, <HI>and repent in dust and ashes.</HI> Job xlii. 6. <HI>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity,</HI> says David, <HI>and in sin did my mother conceive me.</HI> Ps. li. 5. <HI>Wo is me, for I am undone,</HI> says Isaiah, <HI>because I am a man of unclean lips.</HI> Isa. vi. 5. <HI>I know,</HI> says St. Paul, <HI>that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing.</HI> Rom. vii. 18. <HI>We ourselves,</HI> says he, to Titus, <HI>were sometimes foolish, disobedient, de∣ceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.</HI> Tit. iii. 3. And speaking of himself, and the Christians at Ephesus, he leaves upon record, this memorable sentence: <HI>We were</HI> BY NA∣TURE <HI>the children of wrath even as others.</HI> Eph. ii. 3. Such humbling thoughts have the best men entertained both of their natural estate, and themselves!</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="017930_0016_0FA37E3B77EC7B88"/>But as no one is a more proper person to ap∣peal to, in this matter, than this learned Apostle, who, by continually conversing with Jews, Heathens, and Christians in his travels, had such an opportunity of knowing mankind; let us hear him sum up the suffrages of his inspired brethren. <HI>What then,</HI> says he, <HI>are we better than they?</HI> Better than the immoral Pagans, and hypocritical Jews, described in the two pre∣ceding chapters? <HI>No, in no wise.</HI> And he proves it by observing: (1) The UNIVERSALITY of human corruption: ALL <HI>are under sin, as it is written, There is</HI> NONE <HI>righteous, no not</HI> ONE: (2) The EXTENT of it in individuals, as it af∣fects the whole man, especially his mind; <HI>There is none that understandeth</HI> the things of God: His affections, <HI>There is none that seeketh after God:</HI> And his actions, <HI>They are all gone out of the way</HI> of duty: <HI>There is none that doth good, no not one</HI>; For <HI>all have their conversation in the lusts of the flesh, and of the mind.</HI> — (3) The OUT-BREAKINGS of this corruption through all the parts of the body: <HI>Their throat, their lips, their mouth, their feet, their eyes, and all their members are together become unprofitable, and in∣struments of unrighteousness.</HI> As for their <HI>tongue,</HI> says St. James, it <HI>is a world of iniquity, it de∣fileth the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire of hell.</HI> And lastly, its MALIGNITY and VIRULENCE: It is loathsome as <HI>an open sepulchre,</HI> terrible as one who <HI>runs to shed blood,</HI> and mortal as <HI>the poison of asps.</HI></P>
<P>From the whole, speaking of all mankind in their unregenerate state, he justly infers, that <HI>destruction and misery are in their ways.</HI> And, lest the self-righteous should flatter themselves,
<PB N="20" REF="017930_0017_0FA37E3C399DBD98"/>
that this alarming declaration doth not regard them, he adds, that <HI>the scriptures conclude</HI> ALL <HI>under sin</HI>; that <HI>there is no difference, for</HI> ALL <HI>have sinned, and come short of the glory of God</HI>; and that <HI>the moral law</HI> denounces a general curse against its violators, <HI>that</HI> EVERY MOUTH <HI>may be stopped and</HI> ALL THE WORLD <HI>may become guilty before God.</HI> Rom. iii. 9. to 23. vi. 19. Eph. ii. 2.</P>
<P>If man is thus corrupt and guilty, he must be liable to condign punishment. Therefore, as the Prophets and Apostles agree with our Lord, in their dismal descriptions of this depravity; so they harmonize with him, in their alarming ac∣counts of his danger. Till he flies to the Re∣deemer as a condemned malefactor, and secures an interest in the salvation provided for the lost, they represent him as on the brink of ruin.</P>
<P>They inform us, that <HI>the wrath of God is re∣vealed from heaven,</HI> not only against some atro∣cious crimes, but <HI>against</HI> ALL <HI>unrighteousness of men.</HI> Rom. i. 18. That EVERY <HI>transgression and disobedience, shall receive a just recompence of reward.</HI> Heb. ii. 2. That <HI>the soul that sinneth shall die,</HI> because <HI>the wages of sin is death,</HI> Eze∣kiel. xviii. 4. Rom. vi. 23.

<P N="2">II. I flatter myself that the doctrine, which we are to try by the touch stone of reason, has been already sufficiently established from scrip∣ture. Nevertheless, that the Reader may have the fullest view of so momentous a subject, I shall yet present him with a recapitulation of the whole, in the words of our pious Reformers, taken out of the Articles, Homilies, and Liturgy of the Church of England.</P>
<P>The 9th Article thus describes our depravity and danger: <HI>Original, or birth-sin is the fault, and corruption of the nature of every man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far gone from original righ∣teousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the spi∣rit; and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's wrath and damnation.</HI></P>
<P>The 35th Article gives sanction to the Homi∣lies, in the following words: <HI>The book of Homi∣lies contains a good and wholesome doctrine, and therefore we judge them to be read in churches, by ministers, diligently and distinctly, that they may be understood by the people.</HI> Let us then see, how they set forth the <HI>good</HI> and <HI>wholesome,</HI> though lamentable and humbling doctrine of our lost estate.</P>
<P>The title of the 2d is: <HI>A Sermon of the mi∣sery of mankind, and of his condemnation to death everlasting by his sin.</HI> In the close of it, the contents of it are summed up in these words: <HI>We have heard how evil we are of ourselves; how of ourselves, and by ourselves, we have no
<PB N="23" REF="017930_0020_0FA37E3E7B213CD0"/>
goodness, help, or salvation; but on the contrary, sin, damnation, and death everlasting.</HI></P>
<P>Our church is uniform in her woful accounts of man's misery. Hear her in the 1st Homily for Whitsunday: <HI>Man,</HI> OF HIS OWN NATURE (since the fall) <HI>is fleshly and carnal, corrupt and nought, sinful and disobedient to God, without any spark of goodness in him, without any virtuous or godly motion, only given to evil thoughts and wicked deeds.</HI></P>
<P>In the Homily on the nativity, she speaks thus: <HI>He</HI> (disobedient man) <HI>was now cursed and abhor'd. Instead of the image of God, he was now become the image of the devil, the bond slave of hell. Altogether spotted and defiled, he seemed to be nothing else but a lump of sin; and therefore, by the just judgment of God, he was condemned to everlasting death. Thus, in Adam, all men be∣came universally mortal, having in themselves nothing but</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prejudiced persons, who instead of considering the entire system of truth, run away with a part de∣tached from the whole, will be offended here, as if our Church "damn'd every body". But the candid Reader will easily observe, that, instead of dooming any one to destruction, she only declares, that the Saviour finds all men in a state of condemnation and misery, where they would eternally remain, were it not for the compassionate equity of our gracious God, which does not permit him to sentence to a <HI>conscious∣ness</HI> of <HI>eternal</HI> torments, any one of his creatures, for a sin, of which they never were <HI>personally</HI> guilty; and of which, consequently, they can never have any <HI>consciousness.</HI></NOTE> <HI>everlasting damnation of body and soul.</HI></P>
<P>The same doctrine is delivered with the same plainness in the 2d part of the Homily on the
<PB N="24" REF="017930_0021_0FA37E3F449585E0"/>
passion. <HI>Adam died the death, that is, became mortal, lost the favour of God, and was cast out of paradise, being no longer a citizen of heaven, but a firebrand of hell, and a bond-slave of the devil. And St. Paul bears witness, that by Adam's offence death came upon all men to condemnation, who be∣came plain reprobates, and cast-aways, * being per∣petually damned to the everlasting pains of hell-fire.</HI></P>
<P>Agreeable to this, we are taught, in the 2d part of the Homily on repentance, that <HI>part of that virtue consists in an unfeigned acknowledgement of our sins to God, whom, by them we have so grievously offended, that if he should deal with us according to his justice, we deserve a thousand hells, if there were so many.</HI></P>
<P>The same vein of wholesome, though unplea∣sant doctrine runs through the Liturgy of our church. She opens her service by exhorting us <HI>not to dissemble, nor cloak, our manifold sins and wickedness.</HI> She acknowledges in her confessions, that <HI>we have erred and strayed from God's ways like lost sheep,</HI>—that <HI>there is no health in us,</HI>—that we are <HI>miserable sinners, miserable offenders, to whom our sins are grievous,</HI> and <HI>the burden of them is intolerable.</HI></P>
<P>She begins her baptismal office by reminding us, that <HI>all men are conceived and born in sin.</HI> She teaches in her catechism, that <HI>we are by nature born in sin, and the children of wrath.</HI> She con∣fesses in the collect before the general thanks∣giving, that <HI>we are tied and bound with the chain of our sins,</HI> and intreats God to <HI>let the pitifulness of his great mercy loose us:</HI> And in her suffrages she beseeches him to <HI>have mercy upon us,</HI> to <HI>spare us,</HI> and <HI>make speed to save us</HI>; a language that can suit none but condemned sinners.</P>
<P>Duly sensible of our extreme danger till we
<PB N="25" REF="017930_0022_0FA37E3FF9BFE7B0"/>
have secured an interest in Christ, at the grave she supplicates the <HI>most holy God, not to deliver us into the bitter pains of eternal death</HI>; and in the litany she beseeches our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>by his agony and bloody sweat, by his cross and passion,</HI> to <HI>deliver us from his wrath and everlasting dam∣nation.</HI> Thus is our church every where con∣sistent with herself, and with the oracles of God, in representing us as corrupt, condemned creatures, in Adam: till we are penitent, ab∣solved believers in Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>The doctrine to be demonstrated in this trea∣tise being thus fully stated, in the consentaneous words of the sacred Writers, and our pious Re∣formers, I shall close this part by an appeal to the Reader's candour and common sense. If such are the sentiments of our church, are those <HI>church-men</HI> reasonable, who intimate, that all the maintainers of them, are either her open or secret enemies? And may they rank with mo∣dest, humble <HI>Christians,</HI> who, instead of the self-abasing scripture doctrine here laid down, boldly substitute pompous, pharisaic descriptions of the <HI>present</HI> dignity and rectitude of human nature? Without waiting for the obvious answer, I pass to the first class of arguments, on which the truth of this mortifying doctrine is established.</P>

<HEAD>SECOND PART.</HEAD>
<P>AS no man is bound to believe what is contrary to common sense; if the above-stated doctrine appears irrational, Scriptures, Articles, Homilies, and Liturgy, are quoted in vain: When men of parts are pressed with their authority, they start from it as an imposition on their reason, and make as honourable a retreat as they possibly can.</P>
<P>Some, to extricate themselves at once, set the Bible aside, as full of incredible assertions. Others with more modesty plead, that the Scriptures have been frequently misunderstood, and are so in the present case. They put grammar criti∣cism, and common sense to the rack, to shew that when the inspired writers say, the <HI>human heart is desperately wicked,</HI> they mean that it is ex∣tremely good; or at least like blank paper, ready to receive either the characters of virtue, or of vice. With respect to the testimony of our re∣formers, they would have you to understand, that in this enlightened age, we must leave their harsh, uncharitable sentiments, to the old Puri∣tans, and the present Methodists.</P>
<P>That such objectors may subscribe as a so∣lemn truth, what they have hitherto rejected as a dangerous error; and that humbled sinners may see the propriety of an heart-felt repent∣ance, and the absolute need of an almighty Re∣deemer; they are here presented with some proofs of our depravity, taken from the astonishing se∣verity of God's dispensations towards mankind.</P>

<HEAD>AXIOM.</HEAD>
<P>If we consider the supreme Being, as creating a world for the manifestation of his glory, the display of his perfections, and the communica∣tion of his happiness to an intelligent creature, whom he would attach to himself by the strongest ties of gratitude and love; we at once perceive, that he never could form this earth and man in their present, disordered, deplorable condition. It is not so absurd to suppose the meridian sun productive of darkness, as to imagine that <HI>infi∣nite Goodness</HI> ever produced any kind or degree of evil.</P>
<P><HI>Infinite Holiness and Wisdom</HI> having assisted in∣finite Goodness, to draw the original plan of the world; it could not but be entirely worthy of its glorious Author, absolutely free from every moral defilement, and natural disorder: Nor could <HI>infinite Power</HI> possibly be at a loss, to exe∣cute what the other divine attributes had con∣trived. Therefore, unless we embrace the sense∣less opinion of the Materialists, who deny the being of a God; or admit the ridiculous creed of the Manichees, who adore two Gods, the one the gracious author of all the good, and the other the mischievous principle of all the evil in the world; we must conclude with Moses, that <HI>every thing which God made, was</HI> at first <HI>very good</HI>; or in other words, that order and beauty, har∣mony and happiness, were stamped upon every part of the creation, and especially on man, the master-piece of creating power in this sublunary world.

Amidst a thousand beauties, that indi∣cate what it was, when God pronounced it <HI>very good,</HI> and as the original also imports, <HI>extremely beautiful:</HI> Amidst the elegant and grand ruins, which form the variety of our smiling land∣scapes, and romantic prospects; can an impar∣tial inquirer help taking notice of a thousand striking proofs, that a multiplied curse rests upon this globe; and that man, who inhabits it, is now disgraced by the God of nature and providence?</P>
<P>Here, deceitful morasses, or faithlest quick∣sands obstruct our way: There, miry, impas∣sible roads, or inhospitable sandy deserts, endan∣ger our life. In one place, we are stopped by stupendous chains of rocky mountains, broken into frightful precipices, or hideous caverns: And in another, we meet with ruinous valleys, cut deep by torrents and water-falls, whose tre∣mendous roar stuns the astonished traveller. Many of the hills are stony, rude, and waste; and most of the plains are covered over with strata of barren sand, stiff clay, or infertile gravel.</P>

his expensive toil with light sheaves, or a blasted harvest.</P>
<P>Consider that immense part of the globe which lies between the tropics: it is parched up by the scorching beams of the vertical sun: There, the tanny inhabitants fan themselves in vain; they pant, they melt, they faint on the sultry couch; and, like the birds of night, dare not appear abroad, till evening shades temper the insuffer∣able blaze of day. View the frozen countries around the poles: In summer, the sun just glances upon them by his feeble, horizontal rays: In winter, he totally deserts them, and they lie bound with rigorous frosts, and buried in continual night. There, the torpid inhabit∣ants know neither harvest nor vintage, the ocean seems a boundless plain of ice, and the continent immense hills of snow.</P>
<P>The temperate zones are indeed blessed with milder climates: But even here, how irregular are the seasons! To go no farther than this fa∣voured island, What means the strange foresight, by which the ice of January is laid in to temper the ardors of July; and the burning mineral is stored up in June, to mitigate the frost in De∣cember? But notwithstanding these precautions, what continual complaints are heard, about the intenseness of the heat, the severity of the cold, or the sudden, pernicious change from the one to the other!</P>
<P>Let us descend to particulars. In winter, how often do drifts of snow bury the starved sheep, and intomb the frozen traveller! In sum∣mer, how frequently do dreadful storms of hail cut down, or incessant showers of rain wash away the fruits of the earth! Perhaps, to com∣pleat the desolation, <HI>water</HI> pours down from all

<P>If heaven seems to dissolve into water in one place, in another it is like brass; it yields nei∣ther fruitful rains nor cooling dews: The earth is like iron under it, and the perishing cattle loll out their parched tongues, where they once drank the refreshing stream. Suppose a few happy districts escape these dreadful scourges for a number of years, are they not at last visited with redoubled severity? And, whilst abused af∣fluence vanishes as a dream before the intoler∣able dearth, do not a starving, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This happened some years ago in this neigh∣bourhood.</NOTE> riotous popu∣lace leave their wretched cottages, to plunder the houses of their wealthy neighbours, despe∣rately venturing the gallows for a morsel of bread.</P>
<P>When some, secure from the attacks of water, quietly enjoy the comforts of plenty, <HI>fire</HI> per∣haps surprizes them in an instant: They awake involved in smoke, and surrounded by crackling flames, through which (if it is not too late) they fly naked at the hazard of their neck, and think themselves happy if, while they leave behind them young children, or aged parents, burning in the blaze of all their goods, they escape them∣selves with dislocated joints or broken bones.

Their piercing shrieks, and the fall of their house, seem to portend a general conflagration; loud confusion increases, disastrous ruin spreads; and perhaps, before they can be stopped, a street, a suburb, a whole city is reduced to ashes.</P>
<P>Turn your imagination from the smoking ruins, to fix it upon the terrifying effects of the <HI>air,</HI> agitated into roaring tempests and boi∣sterous hurricanes. Before their impetuous blast, the masts of ships and cedars of Lebanon, are like broken reeds; men of war, and solid build∣ings like the driven chaff. Here, they strip the groaning forests, tear the bosom of the earth, and obscure the sky with clouds of whirling sand: And there, they plow up the liquid foam∣ing plains, and with sportive fury turn up mountains for ridges, or cut valleys instead of furrows. As they pass along, the confound∣ed elements dreadfully roar under the mighty scourge, the rolling sea tosses herself up to hea∣ven, and solid land is <HI>swept with the besom of destruction.</HI></P>
<P>To heighten the horror of the scene, <HI>thunder,</HI> the majestic voice of an angry God, and the aw∣ful artillery of heaven, bursts in loud claps from the lowring sky. Distant hills reverberate and increase the alarming sound, and with rocking edifices declare to man, that <HI>vengeance belongeth unto God:</HI> And, to inforce the solemn warning, repeated flashes of <HI>lightning,</HI> with horrible glare dazzle his eyes, and with forked fires strike con∣sternation into his breast; if they do not actu∣ally strike him dead, in the midst of his shattered habitation.</P>
<P>Nor doth heaven alone dart destructive fires; <HI>earth,</HI> our mother earth, as if it were not enough frequently to corrupt the atmosphere by pesti∣lential

vapours, borrows the assistance of the de∣vouring element, to terrify and scourge her guilty children. By sudden, frightful chasms, and the mouth of her burning mountains, she vomits clouds of smoke, sulphureous flames, and calcined rocks; she emits streams of melted mi∣nerals, covers the adjacent plains with boiling, fiery lavas; and, as if she wanted to ease herself of the burden of her inhabitants, suddenly rises against them, and <HI>in battles of shaking</HI> at once crushes, destroys, and buries them in heaps of ruins.</P>
<P>These astonishing scenes, like a bloody battle that is seen at a distance, may indeed entertain us: They may amuse our imagination, when in a peaceful apartment, we behold them beauti∣fully represented by the pen of a Virgil, or the pencil of a Raphael. But to be in the midst of them, as thousands are sooner or later, is inex∣pressibly dreadful: It is actually to see the fore∣runners of divine vengeance, and hear the shake∣ing of God's destructive rod: It is to behold at once a lively emblem, and an awful pledge of that <HI>fire and brimstone, storm and tempest,</HI> which the righteous Governor of the world will <HI>rain upon the ungodly</HI>; when <HI>the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, the elements shall melt with fer∣vent heat, and the earth, with the works that are therein, shall be burnt up.</HI></P>
<P>Now as reason loudly declares, that the God of order, justice, and goodness, could never esta∣blish and continue this fearful course of things, but to punish the disorders of the <HI>moral</HI> world by those of the <HI>natural</HI>; we must conclude that man is guilty, from the alarming tokens of divine displeasure, which sooner or later are so conspicuous in every part of the habitable globe.</P>

<P>We have taken a view of the residence of mankind: let us now behold them entering upon the disordered scene. And here Reason informs us, that some mystery of iniquity lies hid under ihe loathsome, painful, and frequently mortal circumstances, which accompany their birth. For it can never be imagined, that a righteous and good God would suffer innocent and pure creatures to come into the world, skilled in no language but that of misery, venting itself in bitter cries, or doleful accents.</P>
<P>It is a matter of fact, that infants <HI>generally</HI> return their first breath with a groan, and salute the light with the voice of sorrow: <HI>Generally,</HI> I say, for some times they are born half dead, and cannot without the utmost difficulty be brought to breathe and groan. But all are born at the hazard of their lives: For, while some cannot press into the land of the living, with∣out being dangerously bruised; others have their tender bones dislocated. Some are almost strangled; and it is the horrible fate of others to be forced into the world by instruments of torture; having their scull bored through or broken to pieces, or their quivering limbs cut or torn off from the unfortunate trunk. Again,</P>
<P>While some appear on the stage of life em∣barrassed with superfluous parts, others unac∣countably mutilated, want those which are ne∣cessary: And what is more terrible still, a few, whose hideous mis-shapen bodies seem calculated to represent the deformity of a fallen soul, rank among frightful monsters; and to terminate the horror of the parents, are actually smothered and destroyed.</P>

<P>If we let our thoughts ascend, from the little sufferers, to the mothers that bear them, we shall find another dreadful proof of the divine displeasure and of our natural depravity. Does not a good master, much more a gracious God, delight in the prosperity and happiness of his faithful servants? If mankind were naturally in their Creator's favour, would he not order the fruit of the womb to drop from it, without any more inconveniency, than ripe vegetables fall
<PB N="35" REF="017930_0032_0FA37E477972E4D8"/>
from the opening husk, or full-grown fruit from the disburdened tree? But how widely dif∣ferent is the case!</P>
<P>Fix your attention on pregnant mothers: See their disquietude and fears. Some go before∣hand through an imaginary travel, almost as painful to the mind, as the real labour is to the body. The dreaded hour comes at last. Good God! What lingering, what tearing pains; what redoubled throes, what killing agonies at∣tend it! See the curse—or rather, see it not. Let the daughter of her who tasted the forbid∣den fruit without the man, drink that bitter cup Without him. Fly from the mournful scene, fly to distant apartments—But in vain—The din of sorrow pursues and overtakes you there.</P>
<P>A child of man is at the point of being born; his tortured mother proclaims the news in the bitterest accents. They increase with her in∣creasing agony. Sympathize and pray, while she suffers and groans—Perhaps while she suf∣fers and dies: For it is possibly her dying groan that reaches your ear. Perhaps nature is spent in the hard travel; her son is born, and with Jacob's wife, she closes her languid eye and ex∣pires. Perhaps the instruments of death are upon her: The keen steel mangles her delicate frame: As Caesar's mother, she generously suf∣fers her body to be opened, that her unborn child may not be torn from her in pieces; and the fertile tree is unnaturally cut down, that its fruit may be safely gathered.</P>
<P>Perhaps neither mother nor child can be saved, and one grave is going to deprive a dis∣tracted mortal of a beloved Rachel, and a long expected Benjamin. If this is the case, O Earth! Earth! Earth! conceal these slain, cover their
<PB N="36" REF="017930_0033_0FA37E483AE92D40"/>
blood, and detain in thy dark bosom, the fear∣ful curse that brought them there. Vain wish! Too active to be confined in thy deepest vaults, it ranges through the world: With unrelenting fierceness it pursues trembling mothers, and forces them to lift up their voice for speedy re∣lief: Though varied according to the accents of an hundred languages, it is the same voice, that of the bitterest anguish: And while it is reverberated from hamlet to hamlet, from city to city, it strikes the unprejudiced inquirer, and makes him confess, that these clouds of unbribed witnesses, by their loud, consentaneous evidence, impeach SIN, the tormenter of the woman, and murderer of her offspring.</P>
<P>But suppose the case is not so fatal, and she is at last delivered; her labour may be over, yet not her pain and danger; a lingering weakness may carry her slowly to her grave. If she reco∣vers, she may be a mother, and yet unable to act a mother's part. Her pining child sucks her dis∣ordered breast in vain: Either the springs of his balmy food are dried up, or they overflow with a putrid, loathsome fluid, and excruciating ul∣cers cause the soft lips of the infant to appear terrible as the edge of the sword.</P>
<P>If she happily escapes this common kind of distress, yet she may date the beginning of some chronical disease, from her dangerous lying-in; and, in consequence of her hard wrestling for the blessing of a child, may with the patriarch go halting all her days. How sensible are the marks of divine indignation, in all these scenes of sorrow! And consequently how visible our sinfulness and guilt.</P>
<P>Nor can the justness of the inference be de∣nied, under pretence that the females of other
<PB N="37" REF="017930_0034_0FA37E48F96FF2F0"/>
animals, which neither <HI>do</HI> nor <HI>can</HI> sin, bring forth their young with pain, as well as women. For, if we take a view of the whole earth, we shall not see any females, except the daughters of Eve, who groan under a periodical disorder, that intails languor and pain, weakness and mortal diseases, on their most blooming days. Nor do we in general find any, that are delivered of their offspring with half the sorrow and dan∣ger of women. These two remarkable circum∣stances loudly call upon us, to look for the cause of the sorrow, which attends the delivery of fe∣male animals, where that sorrow is most sensibly felt; and to admire the perfect agreement, that subsists between the observations of natural phi∣losophers, and the assertion of the most ancient historian.

<P>If we advert to mankind, even before they burst the womb of their tortured mothers, they afford us a new proof of their total degeneracy. For reason dictates, that if they were not con∣ceived in sin, the Father of mercies could not, consistently with his goodness and justice, com∣mand the cold hand of death to nip them in the unopened, or just opened bud. This neverthe∣less happens every hour. Who can number the early miscarriages of the womb? How many millions of miserable embrios feel the pangs of death before those of birth, and preposterously turn the fruitful womb into a living grave? And how many millions more of wretched infants, escape the dangers of their birth-day, and salute the troublesome light, only to take their un∣timely leave of it, after languishing a few days

on the rack of a convulsive, or torturing disor∣der? I ask again, Would a good and righteous God seal the death-warrant of such multitudes of his unborn, or newly born creatures, if their natural depravity did not render them proper subjects of dissolution?</P>
<P>It is true, the young of beasts suffer and die, as well as infants; but it is only because they are involved in our misery. They partake of it as the attendants of a noble traitor share in his deserved ruin. Sin, that inconceivable virulent and powerful evil, drew down God's righteous curse upon all that was created for man's use, as well as upon man himself. Hence only springs the degeneracy and death, that turn beasts to one promiscuous dust with mankind. Compare Gen. iii. 17. Rom. v. 12. and viii. 22. We may then justly infer, from the sufferings and death of still-born or new-born children, that man is totally degenerate, and liable to destruc∣tion, even from his mother's womb.</P>

<P>But take your leave of the infant corpse, al∣ready buried in the womb, or deposited in a cof∣fin of a span long; fix your attention on the healthy, sucking child.

<P>Part of the divine image, in which he was made in Adam, consisted in purity, power, and knowledge: But now, he is naturally the least cleanly, as well as the most helpless and igno∣rant of all animals. Yes, if the reader could forgive the indelicacy of the assertion, for the
<PB N="39" REF="017930_0036_0FA37E4A788D0918"/>
sake of its truth, I would venture to shew, that there is no comparison between the cleanliness of the little active animals, which suck the filthy swine, and of helpless infants, who suck the purer breasts of their tender mothers. But, casting a veil over the dribbling, loathsome, little creatures; without fear of being contra∣dicted I aver, that the young of those brutes, which are stupid to a proverb, know their dams, and follow them as soon as they are dropped; whilst infants are months without taking any particular notice of their parents, and without being able, I shall not say to follow them, but even to bear the weight of their swaddled body, or stand upon their tottering legs.</P>
<P>With reference to the knowledge necessary for the support of animal life, it is undeniable that brutes have greatly the advantage of man∣kind. Fowls and fishes, immediately and with amazing sagacity, single out their proper nou∣rishment, among a thousand useless and noxious things: But infants put indifferently to their mouth all that comes to their hand, whether it be food or poison, a coral or a knife: And, what is more astonishing still, grown-up per∣sons scarce ever attain to the knowledge of the quantity, or quality of the meat and drink, which are most suitable to their constitutions.</P>
<P>All disordered dogs fix at once upon the sa∣lutary vegetable, that can (in some cases) re∣lieve their distress: But many physicians, even after several years study and practice, hurt and sometimes kill their patients by improper medi∣cines. Birds of passage by mere instinct, find the north and the south more readily than ma∣riners by the compass. Untaught spiders weave their webs, and uninstructed bees make their
<PB N="40" REF="017930_0037_0FA37E4B39940168"/>
combs to the greatest perfection: But fallen man must serve a tedious apprenticeship to learn his own business; and with all the help of ma∣sters, tools, and patterns, seldom proves an in∣genious artist.</P>
<P>Again. Other animals are provided with a natural covering, that answers the double end of usefulness and ornament: But indigent man is obliged to borrow from plants, beasts, and worms, the materials with which he hides his nakedness, or defends his feebleness; and a great part of his short life is spent in providing, or putting on and off garments, the gaudy tokens of his shame, or ragged badges of his fall.</P>
<P>Are not these plain proofs, that man, who ac∣cording to his superior rank, and primitive ex∣cellency, should in all things have the pre-emi∣nence, is now a degraded being, cursed for his apostacy with native uncleanliness, helpless∣ness, ignorance, and nakedness above all other animals?</P>

<P>Man's natural ignorance, great as it is, might nevertheless be overlooked, if he had but the right knowledge of his Creator. But alas! The holy and righteous God judicially with∣draws himself from his unholy, apostate creature. Man is not properly acquainted with him <HI>in whom he lives, and moves, and hath his being.</HI> This humbling truth may be demonstrated by the following observations.</P>
<P>God is infinitely perfect; all the perfection which is found in the most exalted creatures, is but the reflection of the transcendent effulgence, belonging to that glorious Sun of spiritual
<PB N="41" REF="017930_0038_0FA37E4C71888EA8"/>
beauty; it is but the surface of the unfathomable depths of goodness, and loveliness, which rege∣nerate souls discover in that boundless ocean of all excellence. If therefore men saw God, they could far less help being struck with holy awe, overwhelmed with pleasing wonder, and ravished with delightful admiration; than a man born blind, and restored to sight in the blaze of a summer's day, could help being transported at the glory of the new and unexpected scene. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Si virtus conspicereter oculis, mirabiles amores excitaret sui. <HI>Cic.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Could we but see virtue in all her beauty,</HI> said an Heathen, <HI>she would ravish our hearts:</HI> How much greater would our ravishment be, if we were in∣dulged with a clear, immediate discovery of the divine beauty, the eternal original of all virtue, the exuberant fountain of all perfection and de∣light? But alas! how few thus behold, know, and admire God, may easily be seen by the im∣pious or vain conduct of mankind.</P>
<P>If a multitude of men ingeniously confess, they know not the king; if they take his sta∣tute, or one of his attendants for him; or if they doubt whether there be a king; or sport with his name and laws in his presence; we reason∣ably conclude, that they neither <HI>see</HI> nor <HI>know</HI> the royal person. And is not this the case of the superstitious, who, like the Athenians, wor∣ship an <HI>unknown God?</HI> Of idolators, who bow to favourite mortals, or lifeless images, as to the true God? Of infidels, who doubt the very be∣ing of a God? And of open sinners, the bulk of mankind, who live every where as if there was none?</P>
<P>Our natural ignorance of God, manifests it∣self
<PB N="42" REF="017930_0039_0FA37E4D00943180"/>
still more evidently, by confessions both of real and nominal Christians. The former, be∣fore they knew God, and were admitted to <HI>be∣hold his glory shining in the face of Jesus Christ,</HI> bitterly complained as Isaiah, <HI>Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself</HI>; or mournfully asked with David, <HI>How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</HI> It is plain then, that, by nature, they were as others, <HI>without God</HI> (practical atheists) <HI>in the world,</HI> and have as much reason as St. Paul to declare, that <HI>the world by wisdom knew not God.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>nominal</HI> Christians, though they daily pray that <HI>the fellowship of the Holy Ghost may be with us all,</HI> it is evident they are utter strangers to communion with God by his Holy Spirit. For if we affirm, that he blesses his children with a spiritual discovery of his presence, and <HI>manifests himself to them as he doth not to the world,</HI> they say we are mad, or call us enthusiasts. This behaviour shews, beyond all confessions, that they are totally unacquainted with <HI>the light of God's countenance:</HI> For, what greater proof can a blind man give, that he has no knowledge of the sun, than to suspect his neighbour of lu∣nacy, for affirming that sunshine is a delightful reality?</P>
<P>From this moral demonstration of our natural ignorance of God, I draw the following con∣clusion: If the Lord, who is a mild and con∣descending king to all his loyal subjects, a fa∣ther full of endearing and tender love to all his dutiful children, hides his face from mankind in a natural state; and if what little they know of him, is only by conjecture, hear-say, or

It is sufficient to leave <HI>without excuse</HI> those who do not improve it till they attain to the saving knowledge mentioned John xvii. 3. 2 John v. 20,</NOTE> inference; it is a proof, that they are under his displeasure; and consequently, that they are rebellious, fallen creatures.</P>
<P>For, what but rebellion could thus separate between beings so nearly related, as an infinitely gracious Creator, and favourite creatures, whose soul is, according to an Heathen, <HI>divinae parti∣cula aurae</HI>; and according to Moses, <HI>the very breath of God?</HI> We may then rationally con∣clude with the evangelical prophet, that <HI>our ini∣quities have separated between us and our God,</HI> and that <HI>our sins have hid his face from us,</HI> eclipsed the sun of righteousness, and brought such dark∣ness on our souls, that, by nature, we know neither what we are, nor what we should be; neither whence we come, nor whither we are going; neither the grand business we have to do, nor the danger that attends our leaving it undone.</P>

<P>If by nature mankind know not the Lord to be their God, is it surprizing that beasts should not know mankind to be their lords? Never∣theless reason agrees with scripture in main∣taining, that man, by far the noblest work of God here below, should, according to the rea∣son and fitness of things, bear rule over all the sublunary creation. But alas! even in this re∣spect, <HI>How is the crown fallen from his head!</HI> Inferior animals have as little regard for him, as he has for his God.</P>

In warmer climes, armies of locusts, more terrible than hosts of men, frequently darken the air, or cover the ground, and equally mock at human power and craft. Wherever they light, all verdure disappears, and the sum∣mer's fruitfulness is turned into wintry de∣solation.</P>
<P>If locusts do not reach this happy island; caterpillars, and a variety of other seemingly in∣significant, but really formidable insects, make a more constant, though less general attack upon our trees and gardens. In vain are they de∣stroyed by millions, they cannot be fully con∣quered; and the yearly-returning plague forces the considerate spectator, to acknowledge the finger of a sin-avenging providence.</P>
<P>Happy would it be for man, if rebellious ani∣mals were satisfied with the produce of his fields and orchards: But alas! They thirst after his blood, and attack his person. Lions, tigers, rattle-snakes, crocodiles, and sharks, whenever they have an opportunity, impetuously attack, furiously tear, and greedily devour him. And what is most astonishing, the basest reptiles are not afraid to breed in his stomach, to live in his very bowels, and to consume his inward parts: While swarms of flying, leaping or creeping in∣sects, too vile to be named, but not to humble a proud apostate, have the insolence to fix upon his skin; and by piercing or furrowing his flesh, suck his blood, and feast upon him from his cradle to the grave.</P>
<P>Domestic animals, it is true, do man excel∣lent service: But, is it not because he either
<PB N="45" REF="017930_0042_0FA37E4EF998B488"/>
forces, or bribes them to it, by continual labour and expence, with which he breaks and main∣tains them? What business have multitudes of men, but to serve the drudges of mankind? What are smiths, farriers, farmers' servants, grooms, hostlers, &amp;c. but the slaves of brutes, washing, currying, shoeing, feeding, and wait∣ing upon them both by day and by night?</P>
<P>And yet, notwithstanding the prerogative granted to Noah's piety, Gen. ix. 2. and the care taken of domestic animals, do they not re∣bel as often as they dare? Here, sheep deemed the quietest of all, run astray, or break into the field of a litigious neighbour: There, the furi∣ous bull pursues and gores, or the raging dog sets upon and tears the inoffensive traveller.

And by infusing their subtle venom into our blood, spread they not anguish and destruction through our ago∣nizing frame? Answer, ye thousands, who died in the wilderness of the bite of fiery serpents; and ye multitudes, who in almost all countries have shared their deplorable fate.</P>
<P>Let us descend to the <HI>vegetable</HI> world. How many deceitful roots, plants, and fruits deposite their pernicious juice in the stomach of those, who unwarily feed upon them!

And do not many go quickly, or slowly to their grave by such melancholy accidents?</P>
<P><HI>Minerals</HI> and <HI>metals</HI> are not the last to enter into the general conspiracy against mankind. Under inoffensive appearances, do not they con∣tain what is destructive to the animal frame? And have not many fallen a sacrifice to their ignorance of the mischief lurking in arsenic,

<P>But if the generality of mankind escape all the various sorts of poison, do they escape the curse of toil and sweat? And is not a great ma∣jority of them reduced to such sordid want and pressing necessity, as to be obliged to do the greatest drudgery for a wretched maintenance?</P>

hour in evidencing their love to him and to each other: they spent their golden moments in admiring the variety and beauty of his works, finding out the divine signatures impressed upon them, swaying their mild scepter over the obedi∣ent creation, and enjoying the rich, incorrupt∣ible fruits, which the earth spontaneously pro∣duced in the greatest perfection and abundance. Thus their pleasure was without idleness or pain, and their employment without toil or weariness.</P>
<P>But no sooner did disobedience open the floodgates of natural evil, than arduous labour came in full tide upon mankind; and a thou∣sand painful arts were invented to mitigate the manifold curse, which sin had brought upon them.</P>
<P>Since the fall, our bodies are become vul∣nerable and shamefully naked; and it is the bu∣siness of thousands to make, or sell all sorts of garments for our defence and ornament. The earth has lost her original fertility; and thou∣sands more with iron instruments open her bo∣som, to force her to yield us a maintenance; or with immense labour secure her precarious, de∣caying fruits: Immoderate rains deprive her of her solidity, and earthquakes or deluges destroy her evenness; numbers therefore are painfully imployed in making or mending roads. Each country affords some only of the necessaries or conveniencies of life; this obliges the mercantile inhabitants to transport, with immense trouble and danger, the produce of one place to supply the wants of another. We are exposed to a va∣riety of dangers: Our persons and property must be secured against the inclemency of the weather, the attacks of evil beasts, and the
<PB N="49" REF="017930_0046_0FA37E51FB8F0E18"/>
assaults of wicked men: Hence the fatigue of millions of workmen in wood and stone, metals and minerals; and the toils and hazards of millions more, who live by making, wear∣ing, or using the various instruments of war and slaughter.</P>
<P>Disorder and injustice give rise to govern∣ment, politics, and a labyrinth of laws; and these employ myriads of officers, lawyers, magistrates, and rulers. We are subject to a thousand pains and maladies; hence myriads more prescribe and prepare remedies, or attend and nurse the sick. Our universal ignorance occasions the tedious labour of giving and re∣ceiving instruction, in all the branches of hu∣man and divine knowledge. And to complete the whole, the original tongue of mankind is confounded, and even neighbouring nations are barbarians to each other: From hence arise the painful lucubrations of critics and linguists, with the infinite trouble of teaching and learn∣ing various languages.</P>
<P>The curse introduced by sin, is the occasion of all these toils. They are soon mentioned, but alas! how long, how grievous do they ap∣pear to those that feel their severity! How many sighs have they forced from the breasts, how much sweat from the bodies of mankind! Unite the former, a tempest might insue: Col∣lect the latter, it would swell into rivers.</P>
<P>To go no farther than this populous parish, with what hardships and dangers do our indi∣gent neighbours earn their bread! See those who ransack the bowels of the earth to get the black mineral we burn: How little is their lot preferable to that of the Spanish felons, who work the golden mines?</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="017930_0047_0FA37E52B9942878"/>They take their leave of the light of the sun, and suspended by a rope, are let down many fa∣thoms perpendicularly towards the center of the globe: they traverse the rocks through which they have dug their horizontal ways: The murderer's cell is a palace, in comparison of the black spot to which they repair: The vagrant's posture in the stocks, is preferable to that in which they labour.</P>
<P>Form, if you can, an idea of the misery of men kneeling, stooping, or lying on one side, to toil all day in a confined place, where a child could hardly stand: Whilst a younger company, with their hands and feet on the black dusty ground, and a chain about their body, creep and drag along, like four-footed beasts, heavy loads of the dirty mineral, through ways almost impassable to the curious observer.</P>
<P>In these low and dreary vaults, all the ele∣ments seem combined against them. Destructive damps and clouds of noxious dust infect the air they breathe. Sometimes water incessantly di∣stills on their naked bodies; or bursting upon them in streams, drowns them, and deluges their work. At other times, pieces of detached rocks crush them to death, or the earth break∣ing in upon them, buries them alive. And fre∣quently sulphureous vapours, kindled in an instant by the light of their candles, form subterraneous thunder and lightning: What a dreadful phoenomenon! How impetuous is the blast! How fierce the rolling flames! How intolerable the noisom smell! How dreadful the continued roar! How violent and fatal the explosion!</P>
<P>Wonderful providence! Some of the unhappy

See them wound up out of the blazing dungeon, and say if <HI>these are not brands plucked out of the fire.</HI> A pestiferous steam, and clouds of suffocating smoke pursue them.

Patient preserver of rebellious Jonah! Will not <HI>these</HI> utter a song—a song of praise to <HI>Thee</HI>—praise ardent as the flames they escape—lasting as the life thou prolongest?— Alas! they refuse! And some—O tell it not among the Heathens, lest they for ever abhor the name of <HI>Christian</HI>—Some return to the very pits, where they have been branded with sul∣phureous fire by the warning hand of provi∣dence; and there, sporting themselves again with the most infernal wishes, call aloud for a fire that cannot be quenched, and challenge the Almighty to cast them into hell, that bot∣tomless pit whence there is no return.</P>
<P>Leave these black men at their perilous work, and see yonder bargemen hauling that loaded vessel against wind and stream. Since the dawn of day, they have wrestled with the impetuous current; and now, that it almost overpowers them, how do they exert all their remaining strength, and strain their every nerve! How are they bathed in sweat and rain! Fastened to their lines as horses to their traces, wherein do they differ from the laborious brutes? Not in an erect posture of body, for in the intenseness of their toil they bend forward, their head is fore∣most,
<PB N="52" REF="017930_0049_0FA37E5437D7E218"/>
and their hands upon the ground. If there is any difference, it consists in this: Horses are indulged with a colar to save their breast; and these, as if theirs was not worth saving, draw without one: The beasts tug in patient silence and mutual harmony; but the men with loud contention and horrible imprecations. O sin, what hast thou done! Is it not enough that these drudges should toil like brutes, must they also curse one another like devils?</P>
<P>If you have gone beyond the hearing of their impious oaths, stop to consider the sons of Vul∣can confined to these forges and furnaces. Is their lot much preferable? A sultry air, and clouds of smoke and dust, are the element in which they labour. The confused noise of wa∣ter falling, steam hissing, fire-engines working, wheels turning, files creaking, hammers beat∣ing, ore bursting, and bellows roaring, form the dismal concert that strikes the ears; while a continual eruption of flames, ascending from the mouth of their artificial volcanos, dazzle their eyes with an horrible glare. Massy bars of hot iron are the heavy tools they handle, cylinders of the first magnitude the enormous weights they heave, vessels full of melted metal the dan∣gerous loads they carry, streams of the same burning fluid the fiery rivers, which they con∣duct into the deep cavities of their subterraneous moulds; and millions of flying sparks, with a thousand drops of liquid, hissing iron, the hor∣rible showers to which they are exposed. See them cast; you would think them in a bath, and not in a furnace: They bedew the burning sand with their streaming sweat: nor are their wet garments dried up, either by the fierce fires
<PB N="53" REF="017930_0050_0FA37E54F8B93D80"/>
that they attend, or the fiery streams which they manage. Certainly, of all men, these have rea∣son to remember the just sentence of an offended God: <HI>In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread, all the days of thy life.</HI></P>
<P>All indeed do not go through the same toil; but all have their share of it, either in body or in mind. Behold the studious son of learning; his intense application hath wasted his flesh, ex∣hausted his spirits, and almost dried up his ra∣dical moisture. Consider the man of fortune: Can his thousands a year exempt him from the curse of Adam? No; he toils perhaps harder in his sports and debaucheries, than the poor plowman that works his estate.</P>
<P>View that corpulent epicure, who idles away the whole day, between the festal board and the dozing couch. You may think that he, at least, is free from the curse which I describe: But you are mistaken: while he is living, as he thinks, a life of luxurious ease and gentle in∣activity, he fills himself with crude humours, and makes way for the gnawing gout and rack∣ing gravel. See even now, how strongly he perspires, and with what uneasiness he draws his short breath, and wipes his dewy, shining face! Surely he toils under the load of an undigested meal. A porter carries a burden upon his brawny shoulders; but this wretch has con∣veyed one into his sick stomach. He will not work; let him alone, and ere long acute pains will bathe him in as acute a sweat, as that of the furnace-man; and strong medicines will exercise him to such a degree, that he will envy even the collier's lot.</P>

<P>To close the horrible prospect, view the ruins of cities and kingdoms, the calamities of wrecks and sieges, the horrors of sea-fights and fields of battle; with all the crimes, devastations, and cruelties, that accompany revenge, contention, and war; and you will be obliged to conclude with Job, that corrupt <HI>man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward</HI>; with David, that <HI>the earth is full of darkness and cruel habitations</HI>; and with every impartial enquirer, that our depravity, and God's justice, concur to make this world <HI>a vale of tears,</HI> as well as a field of toil and sweat; a vast prison for rebels already "tied with the chains of their sins," a boundless scaf∣fold for their execution, a golgotha, an <HI>aceldama,</HI> an immense <HI>field of</HI> torture and <HI>blood.</HI></P>
<P>Some will probably say, "This picture of the world is drawn with black lines, but kinder providence blends light and shade together, and tempers our calamities with numberless bless∣ings." I answer: It cannot be too thankfully acknowledged, that, while patience suspends the stroke of justice, God, for Christ's sake, restores
<PB N="58" REF="017930_0055_0FA37E58B8CBA858"/>
us a thousand forfeited blessings, that <HI>his good∣ness may lead us to repentance.</HI> But alas! What is the consequence, where divine grace does not prove victorious over corrupt nature? To all our sins, do we not add the crime of either en∣joying the favours of providence with the greatest ingratitude, or of abusing them with the most provoking insolence.</P>
<P>Our actions are far more expressive of our real sentiments, than our words. Why this variety of exquisite food, says the voluptuary, whose life loudly speaks what his lips dare not utter? Why this abundance of delicious wines, but to tempt my unbridled appetite, and please my luxurious palate?—Would God have given softness to silks, brightness to colours, and lustre to diamonds, says the self-applauding smile of a foolish virgin, who worships herself in a glass? Would he have commanded the white of the lily thus to meet the blush of the rose, and heighten so elegant a proportion of features, if he had not designed that the united powers of art, dress, and beauty, should make me share his divine honours?—Why are we blessed with dear children and amiable friends, says the ridi∣culous behaviour of fond parents and raptured lovers, but that we should suspend our hap∣piness on their ravishing smiles, and place them as favourite idols in the shrine of our hearts?— And why has heaven favoured me both with a strong constitution, and an affluent fortune, says the rich slave of brutish lusts, but that I may drink deeper of earthly joys and sensual delights?</P>
<P>Thus blessings abused or unimproved, become curses in our hands: God's indulgence encou∣rages us to offend him: We have the fatal
<PB N="59" REF="017930_0056_0FA37E59794CFDB8"/>
skill of extracting poison from the sweetest flowers; and madly turn the gifts of providence into weapons, to attack our Benefactor and de∣stroy ourselves. That there are then such per∣verted gifts, does not prove that mankind are in∣nocent, but that <HI>God's patience endureth yet daily,</HI> and that a Saviour <HI>ever liveth to make intercession for us.</HI></P>
<P>Should it be farther objected, that "our plea∣sures counter-balance our calamities:" I ans∣wer: The greatest part of mankind are so op∣pressed with want and cares, toil and sickness, that their intervals of ease may rather be termed "an alleviation of misery," than "an enjoy∣ment of happiness." Our pains are real and lasting, our joys imaginary and momentary. Could we exercise all our senses upon the most pleasing objects, the tooth-ach would render all insipid and burdensome; a fit of the gout alone damps every worldly joy, while all earthly de∣lights together cannot give us ease under it: So vastly superior is the bitterness of one bodily pain, to the sweetness of all the pleasures of sense!</P>
<P>If objectors still urge, that "sufferings are needful for our trial:" I reply, They are neces∣sary for our <HI>punishment</HI> and <HI>correction,</HI> but not for our <HI>trial.</HI> A good king can <HI>try</HI> the loyalty of his subjects, without putting them to the rack. Let Nero and Bonner <HI>try</HI> the innocent by all sorts of tortures, but let not their barba∣rity be charged upon a God strictly just, and infinitely good.</P>
<P>However, "calamities prove a blessing to seme."—And so does transportation: But who ever inferred from thence, that reformed felons were transported for the <HI>trial</HI> of their virtue,
<PB N="60" REF="017930_0057_0FA37E5A395F39B0"/>
and not for the <HI>punishment</HI> of their crimes? I conclude therefore, that our calamities and mi∣series demonstrate our corruption, as strongly as the punishments of the bastinado and pillory, appointed by an equitable judge, prove the guilt of those, on whom they are frequently and se∣verely inflicted.</P>

<P>Would to God the multiplied calamities of life were a sufficient punishment for our des∣perate wickedness! But alas! they only make way for the pangs of death. Like traitors, or rather like <HI>wolves</HI> and <HI>vipers,</HI> to which the Son of God compares natural men, we are all de∣voted to destruction. Yes, as we kill those mischievous creatures, so God destroys the sin∣ful sons of men.</P>
<P>If the reader is offended, and denies the mor∣tifying assertion, let him visit with me the mournful spot, where thousands are daily exe∣cuted, and where hundreds make this moment their dying speech. I do not mean what some call "the bed of honour," a field of battle, but a common death-bed.</P>
<P>Observing, as we go along, those black tro∣phies of the king of terrors, those escutcheons, which preposterous vanity fixes up in honour of the deceased, when kind charity should hang them out as a warning to the living; let us re∣pair to those mournful apartments, where weep∣ing attendants support the dying, where swoon∣ing friends embrace the dead, or whence dis∣tracted relatives carry out the pale remains of all their joy.</P>
<P>Guided by their groans and funeral lights, let us proceed to the dreary charnal-houses and
<PB N="61" REF="017930_0058_0FA37E5AF8009410"/>
calvaries, which we decently call <HI>vaults</HI> and <HI>church-yards:</HI> and without stopping to look at the monuments of some, whom my objector re∣members as vigorous as himself; and of others, who were perhaps his partners in nightly revels; let us hasten to see the dust of his mouldered an∣cestors, and to read upon yonder coffins, the dear name of a parent, a child, perhaps a wife, turned off from his bosom into the gulph of eternity.</P>
<P>If this sight does not convince him, I shall open one of the noisome repositories, and shew him the deep hollows of those eyes, that darted tender sensation into his soul; and odious rep∣tiles fattened upon the once charming, now ghastly face, he doted upon.—But, methinks he turns pale at the very proposal, and, rather than be confronted with such witnesses, acknow∣ledges, that he is condemned to die, with all his dear relatives, and the whole human race.</P>
<P>And is this the case? Are we then under sentence of death? How awful is the considera∣tion! Of all the things that nature dreads, is not <HI>death</HI> the most terrible? And is it not (as being the greatest of temporal evils) appointed by hu∣man and divine laws, for the punishment of ca∣pital offenders; whether they are named <HI>felons</HI> and <HI>traitors,</HI> or more generally called <HI>men</HI> and <HI>sinners?</HI> Let matter of fact decide.</P>
<P>Whilst earthly judges condemn murderers and traitors to be hanged or beheaded; does not <HI>the Judge of all,</HI> sentence sinful mankind, either to pine away with old age, or be wasted with con∣sumptions, burned with fevers, scalded with hot humors, eaten up with cancers, putrified by mortifications, suffocated by asthmas, strangled by quinseys, poisoned by the cup of excess, stabbed with the knife of luxury, or racked to
<PB N="62" REF="017930_0059_0FA37E5BB98E8328"/>
death by disorders as loathsome, and accidents as various as their sins?</P>
<P>If you consider the circumstances of their execution, where is the material difference be∣tween the malefactor and the sinner? The jailor and the turnkey confine the one to his cell: The disorder and the physician confine the other to his bed. The one lives upon bread and water: The other upon draughts and bo∣luses. The one can walk with his fetters: The other loaded with blisters can scarcely turn himself. The one enjoys freedom from pain, and has the perfect use of his senses: The other complains he is racked all over, and is frequently delirious. The executioner does his office upon the one in a few minutes: But the physician and his medicines, make the other linger for days, before he can die out of his misery. An honest sheriff, and constables armed with staves, wait upon one; while a greedy undertaker and his party, with like emblems of authority, ac∣company the other: And if it is any advantage to have a numerous attendance, without com∣parison the felon his the greater train.</P>
<P>When the pangs of death are over, does not the difference made between the corpses consist more in appearance than reality? The murderer is dissected in the surgeon's hall gratis, and the rich sinner is embowelled in his own apartment at great expence. The robber exposed to open air, wastes away in hoops of iron; and the gen∣tleman confined to a damp vault, moulders away in sheets of lead: And while the fowls of the air greedily prey upon the one, the vermin of the earth eagerly devour the other.</P>
<P>And if you consider them as launching into the world of spirits; is not the advantage, in one respect, on the malefactor's side? He is so∣lemnly
<PB N="63" REF="017930_0060_0FA37E5C7ADD7158"/>
assured he must die; and when the death-warrant comes down, all about him bid him prepare, and make the best of his short time: But the physician and chaplain, friends and attendants, generally flatter the honourable sinner to the last: And what is the consequence? He either sleeps on in carnal security, till death puts an end to all his delusive dreams; or, if he has some notion that he must repent, for fear of discomposing his spirits, he still puts it off till <HI>to morrow</HI>; and in the midst of his delays God says, <HI>Thou Fool,</HI> THIS NIGHT <HI>thy soul shall be re∣quired of thee.</HI> What wonder is it then, if when the converted thief goes from the ignominious tree to paradise, the impenitent rich man passes from <HI>his purple bed,</HI> into an awful eternity, and there <HI>lifts up his eyes in</HI> unexpected <HI>torments?</HI></P>
<P>If these are truths too obvious to be denied, wilt thou, Sinner, as the thoughtless vulgar, blunt their edge, by saying, with amazing un∣concern, "Death is a debt we must all pay to nature?" Alas! This is granting the point; for if all have contracted so dreadful a debt, all are in a corrupt and lost state. Nor is this debt to be paid to <HI>Nature,</HI> but to <HI>Justice</HI>; other∣wise dying would be as easy as sleeping, or any other natural action: But it is beyond expres∣sion terrible to thee, from whose soul the Re∣deemer has not extracted <HI>sin,</HI> the monster's <HI>sting:</HI> And if thou dost not see it now in the most alarming light, it is because either thou imaginest it at a great distance; or the double veil of rash presumption, and brutish stupidity, is yet upon thy hardened heart.</P>
<P>Or wilt thou, as the poor Heathens, comfort thyself with the cruel thought, that "thou shalt not die alone?" Alas! dying companions may increase, but cannot take off the horror of deso∣lution.
<PB N="64" REF="017930_0061_0FA37E5D39C258B0"/>
Besides, though we live in a crowd, we generally die alone: Each must drink that bitter cup, as if he were the only mortal in the universe.</P>
<P>What must we do then, in such deplorable circumstances? What! But humble ourselves in the dust, and bow low to the scepter of divine justice; confessing that since the righteous God has condemned us to certain death, and in ge∣neral to a far more lingering and painful death, than murderers and traitors are made to under∣go, we are certainly degenerate creatures and capital offenders, who stand in absolute need of an Almighty Redeemer.</P>
<P>Permit me now, candid Reader, to make a so∣lemn appeal to thy reason assisted by the fear of God. From all that has been advanced, does it not appear, that man is no more the favoured, happy, and innocent creature he was, when he came out of the hands of his infinitely gracious Creator? And is it not evident that, whether we consider him as born into this disordered world, or dying out of it, or passing from the womb to the grave, under a variety of calamitous circumstances, God's providential dealings with him prove, that he is by nature in a corrupt and lost estate?</P>

<HEAD>THIRD PART.</HEAD>
<P>WE have hitherto considered man as a miserable inhabitant of a wretched world. We have seen him surrounded by mul∣titudes of wants; pursued by legions of dis∣tresses, maladies, and woes; arrested by the king of terrors: cast into the grave; and shut up there, the loathsome prey of corruption and worms. Let us now consider him as a <HI>moral agent</HI>; and by examining his disposition, cha∣racter, and conduct, let us see whether he is wisely punished, according to the sentence of impartial justice; or wantonly tormented, at the caprice of arbitrary power.</P>
<P>We cannot help acknowledging, it is highly reasonable, first, that all intelligent creatures should love, reverence, and obey their Creator; because he is most eminently their Father, their Master, and their King: Secondly, that they should assist, support, and love each other, as fellow-subjects, fellow-servants, and children of the same universal parent: And thirdly, that they should preserve their souls and bodies in peace and purity; by which means alone they can be happy in themselves, profitable to man, and acceptable to God. This is what we ge∣nerally call <HI>natural religion,</HI> which is evidently founded upon eternal reason, the fitness of things, and the essential relation of persons.</P>
<P>The propriety of these sanctions is so self-evident, that <HI>the Gentiles, who have not the</HI> written <HI>law, are a law unto themselves, and do</HI> (but alas!
<PB N="66" REF="017930_0063_0FA37E5EB976F3E8"/>
how seldom, and from what motives!) <HI>the things contained in the law,</HI> thus <HI>shewing that the work,</HI> the sum and substance <HI>of the law,</HI> though much blotted by the fall, <HI>is</HI> still <HI>written in their heart.</HI> Nor will it be erased thence in hell itself; for nothing but a sight of the equity of God's law, can clear his vindictive justice in the guilty breast, give a scorpion's sting to the worm that gnaws the stubborn offender, and arm his up∣braiding conscience with a whip of biting serpents.</P>
<P>Since the moral law so strongly recommends itself to reason, let us see how universally it is observed or broken: So shall matter of fact de∣cide, whether we are pure and upright, or pol∣luted and depraved.</P>
<DIV3 N="12" TYPE="argument">

<P>Those who reject the scriptures, universally agree, that <HI>all have sinned,</HI> and that <HI>in many things we offend all.</HI> Hence it appears, that per∣sons of various constitutions, ranks, and educa∣tion; in all nations, religions, times, and places; are born in such a state, and with such a nature, that they infallibly commit <HI>many</HI> sins in thought, word, or deed.</P>
<P>But <HI>one</HI> transgression would be sufficient to render them obnoxious to God's displeasure, and to bring them under the fearful curse of his broken law: For, even according to the statutes of this realm, a man, who <HI>once</HI> robs a traveller of a small sum of money, forfeits his life; as well as the bloody highwayman, who for years barbarously murders all those whom he stops, and accumulates immense wealth by his repeated barbarities.</P>

So sure then as one rob∣bery deserves the gallows, one sin deserves death; for <HI>The soul that sinneth,</HI> says God's law, and not the soul that committeth so many sins, of such or such an heinousness, it <HI>shall die.</HI> Hence it is, that the first sin of the first man was punished both with spiritual and bodily death, and with ten thousand other evils. The justice of this sanction will appear in a satisfactory light, if we consider the following remarks:</P>
<P N="1">1. In our present natural state, we are such strangers to God's glory, and the spirituality of his law; and we are so used to <HI>drink</HI> the deadly poison of <HI>iniquity like water,</HI> that we have no idea of the horror, which should seize upon us, after a breach of the divine law. We are there∣fore as unfit judges of the atrociousness of sin, as lawless, hardened assassins, who shed human blood like water, are of the heinousness of murder.</P>
<P N="2">2. As every wilful sin arises from a disregard of that sovereign authority, which is equally stamped upon all the commandments; it hath in it the principle and nature of all possible ini∣quity, that is, the disregard and contempt of the Almighty.</P>
<P N="3">3. There is no <HI>proper merit</HI> before God, in the longest and most exact course of obedience, but infinite demerit in one, even the least act of wilful disobedience. <HI>When we have done all that is commanded us, we are</HI> still <HI>unprofitable servants</HI>; for the self-sufficient God has no more need of us, than a mighty monarch, of the vilest insects
<PB N="68" REF="017930_0065_0FA37E6045E4CA00"/>
that creep in the dust beneath <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> feet: And our best actions, strictly speaking <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>serve abso∣lutely nothing from our Creator and Preserver, because we owe him all we have, and are, and can possibly do. But if we transgress in one point, we ruin all our obedience, and expose ourselves to the just penalty of his broken law. The following example may illustrate this ob∣servation.</P>
<P>If a rich man gives a <HI>thousand</HI> meals to an in∣digent neighbour, he acts only as a man, he does nothing but his duty; and the judge al∣lows him no reward. But if he gives him only <HI>one</HI> dose of poison, he acts as a <HI>murderer,</HI> and must die a shameful death: So greatly does one act of sin outweigh a thousand acts of obedience! How exceedingly absurd then, is the common notion, that our good works counter-balance our bad ones! Add to this, that</P>
<P N="4">4. Guilt necessarily rises in proportion to the baseness of the offender, the greatness of the fa∣vours conferred upon him, and the dignity of the person offended. An insulting behaviour to a servant is a fault, to a magistrate it is a crime, to a king it is treason. And what is wilful sin, but an injury offered by an impotent rebel, to the infinitely powerful Law-giver of the uni∣verse, to the kindest of Benefectors, to the graci∣ous Creator and Preserver of men—an insult given to the supreme Majesty of heaven and earth, in whose glorious presence the dignity of the greatest potentate and arch-angel, as truly disappears, as the splendor of the stars in the blaze of the meridian sun? Sin therefore flying in the face of such a Law-giver, Benefactor, and Monarch, has in it a kind of infinite deme∣rit from its infinite Object; and rebellious, un∣grateful,

<P>Our natural depravity manifests itself by con∣stant omissions of duty, as much by flagrant commissions of sin, and perhaps much more. Take one instance out of many, that might be produced. Constant displays of preserving good∣ness, and presents undeservedly and uninter∣ruptedly bestowed upon us, deserve a perpetual tribute of heart-felt gratitude: God demands it in his law; and conscience, his agent in our souls, declares, it ought in justice to be payed.</P>
<P>But where shall we find a Deist, properly conscious of what he owes the supreme Being, for his "creation, preservation, and all the bless∣ings of this life?" And where, a Christian duly sensible of "God's inestimable love in the re∣demption of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ?" A <HI>due sense</HI> of his ever-multiplied mercies, would fill our souls with never ceasing wonder, and make our lips overflow with rapturous praise.

<PB N="70" REF="017930_0067_0FA37E61B7FD8EA0"/>
of which all are naturally guilty; and for which, it is to be feared, the best owe ten thousand talents both to divine goodness and justice?</P>
<P>Throw only a few bones to a dog, and you win him: He follows you: Your word be∣comes his law: Upon the first motion of your hand he flies through land and water to execute your commands: Obedience is his delight, and your presence his paradise: He convinces you of it by all the demonstrations of joy, which he is capable of giving: And if he un∣happily loses sight of you, he exerts all his sa∣gacity to trace your footsteps; nor will he rest, till he finds his benefactor again.</P>
<P>Shall a brute be so thankful to a man for some offals, while man himself is so full of in∣gratitude to God, who created him, preserves his life from destruction, and hourly crowns him with mercies and loving-kindness! How should shame cover our guilty faces! Surely, if the royal prophet could say, he <HI>was as a beast before God</HI>; may we not well confess, that, in point of gratitude, we are worse than the dullest and most stupid part of the brute creation? For even <HI>The ox,</HI> says the Lord, <HI>knoweth his owner,</HI> and <HI>the ass his master's crib; but Israel doth not know</HI> me, <HI>my people doth not consider</HI> my daily fa∣vours.

<P>But, though we seem made of cold inatten∣tion, when the sight of divine mercies should kindle our heart into gratitude and praise; we soon get out of this languid frame of mind: For, in the pursuit of sensual gratifications, we are all activity and warmth; we seem an ardent compound of life and fire.</P>
<P>What can be the reason of this amazing dif∣ference? —What but rebellious sense, and wan∣ton appetite, raised at the sight or idea of some forbidden object! The bait of pleasure appears, corrupt nature summons all her powers, every nerve of expectation is stretched; every pulse of desire beats high; the blood is in a general fer∣ment; the spirits are in an universal hurry; and though the hook of a fatal consequence is often apparent, the alluring bait must be swal∣lowed. The fear of God, the most inestimable of all treasures, is already gone; and if the sinful gratification cannot be enjoyed upon any other term, a good reputation shall go also. Reason indeed makes remonstrances; but the loud clamours of flesh and blood, soon drown her soft whispers. The carnal mind steps im∣periously upon the throne: Sense, that con∣quers the greatest conquerors, bear down all op∣position: The yielding man is led captive by a brutish lust; and while angels blush, there is joy in hell over the actual, and compleat degra∣dation of an heaven born spirit.</P>
<P>Some indeed affirm, that these conflicts suit a state of probation and trial. But it is evi∣dent, that either our temptations are too vio∣lent for our strength, or our strength too weak for our temptations; since, notwithstanding the
<PB N="72" REF="017930_0069_0FA37E63830E2E48"/>
additional help of divine grace, there never was a mere mortal, over whom they never triumphed.</P>
<P>Nor can we exculpate ourselves by pleading, that these triumphs of sense over reason, are nei∣ther long nor frequent. Alas! How many perpetrate an act of wickedness in a moment, and suffer death itself for a crime which they never repeated!</P>
<P>See that chrystal vessel. Its brightness and brittleness represent the shining, and delicate nature of true virtue. If I let it fall, and break it, what avails it to say, "I never broke it be∣fore —I dropped it but once—I am excessively sorry for my carelessness—I will set the pieces together, and never break it again:" Will these excuses and resolutions prevent the vessel from being broken—broken for ever? The reader may easily make the application.</P>
<P>Even Heathen moralists, by their fabulous account of the companions of Ulysses, turned into swine, upon drinking <HI>once</HI> of Circe's en∣chanted cup, teach us, that <HI>one</HI> fall into sensua∣lity, turns a man into a brute; just as one slip into unchastity or dishonesty, changes a modest woman into a strumpet, or an honest man into a thief. Again,</P>
<P>Ought not reason to have as absolute a com∣mand over appetite, as a skilful rider has over a well-broken horse? But suppose we saw all horsemen universally mastered, one time or other, by their beasts; and forced, though but for a few minutes, to receive the bit, and go or stop at the pleasure of the wanton brutes: should we not wonder, and justly infer, that man had lost the kind of superiority, which he still main∣tains over domestic animals?

<P>We may then conclude, that the universal re∣bellion of our lower faculties against our supe∣rior powers, and the triumphs of sense over rea∣son, demonstrate, that human nature has suf∣fered as fatal a revolution, as these kingdoms did, when a degraded king was seen bleeding on the scaffold, and a base usurper lording it in the seat of majesty.</P>

Alas! let us only consider, how easily we forget the favours of our Creator, and recollect the injuries of our fellow-creatures; how little we retain of a good book, or pious discourse, and how much of a play, or frivolous conversation: and how exactly we remember an invitation to a party of pleasure, whilst the loudest calls to turn to God, and prepare for death, are no sooner heard than forgotten.—Let us, I say, consider these things, and we shall be forced to confess, that this useful power loses like a sieve the living water of truth, drinks in like a spunge the muddy streams of vanity, and is never so retentive, as when it is excited by re∣venge, or some other detestable temper.</P>

The Rev. Author takes his estimate of human nature, not from universal experience, but his indulged imagination; not from St. <HI>Paul,</HI> the chief of the apostles, but from Dr. <HI>Taylor, to whom he acknow∣ledges his obligations for several of the best passages in his sermon.</HI> Passing over the exposition of his text, where he oddly supposes that our Lord meant, by <HI>the drawings of God,</HI> the natural powers of man; which is as reasonable as to suppose, that when he said, <HI>Without</HI> ME <HI>you can do nothing,</HI> he meant that <HI>me</HI> should signify <HI>ourselves:</HI>—Passing this over, I shall just point out his capital mistake. He tells us, that <HI>All our faculties and powers</HI> ARE <HI>good and beautiful in their order,</HI> [that they were so before the fall, is fully granted] <HI>and tend naturally to the happi∣ness both of the individual and the system:</HI> And he adds, that <HI>How weak soever and imperfect our intel∣lectual faculties may be, yet to speak reproachfully of them in general, is a species of blasphemy against our Creator.</HI> If to expose the present weakness of our rational faculties, and shew how greatly they are disordered and impaired by the fall, is what this di∣vine calls <HI>speaking reproachfully of them,</HI> have not the best men been found guilty of this pretended <HI>blas∣phemy?</HI> How far the apostles and reformers carried it, may be seen in the first part of this treatise. How he can clear himself of it, as a subscriber to the 9th, 10th, and 35th articles of our church, I cannot see: And by what means he will justify his conduct to the world, in receiving hundreds a year to maintain the doctrine of the church of England, while he publicly exposes it as a <HI>species of blasphemy,</HI> is still a greater mystery. Far from seeing that <HI>all the fa∣culties and powers,</HI> by which this is done, <HI>are good and beautiful,</HI> I cannot help thinking some of them are materially defective; and that though such a conduct may very much <HI>tend to the</HI> emolument <HI>of the individual,</HI> it has little tendency <HI>to the happiness of the system.</HI> For my part, were I to commence ad∣vocate for the <HI>uprightness</HI> of human nature, I would save appearances, lest Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> himself should say, <HI>Non defensoribus istis,</HI> &amp;c.—But dropping this point, I appeal to common sense: Who is most guilty of <HI>blasphemy against our Creator</HI>; he who says God made man both holy and happy, affirming that the present weakness of our rational powers, is en∣tirely owing to the original apostacy of mankind: Or he, who intimates, that the gracious Author of our being, formed our intellectual faculties weak and imperfect as they now are? If it is not the lat∣ter, my understanding is strangely defective.—In vain does this learned divine tell us, that <HI>the candle of the Lord which was lighted up in man at first, when the inspiration of the Almighty gave him understand∣ing, was not extinguished by the original apostacy, but has kept burning ever since,</HI> and that <HI>divine flame has catched from father to son, and has been propagated quite down to the present generation:</HI> If it is reasonable to charge with <HI>a species of blasphemy</HI> those, who re∣verence their Creator too much▪ to father our pre∣sent state of imperfection upon him, I must confess <HI>my</HI> reason fails; I have outlived <HI>the divine flame</HI> for one, or it never <HI>catched from</HI> my <HI>father</HI> to <HI>me.</HI>— A fear left fome well-meaning person should mis∣take the taper of Pelagius, or the lamp of Dr. Tay∣lor, for <HI>the candle of the Lord,</HI> and follow it in the destructive paths of error, extorts this note from my pen.

<P>Our WILL, in general, is full of obstinacy: We must have our own way, right or wrong.

<PB N="79" REF="017930_0076_0FA37E687958AA00"/>
of doing it with all our might, we frequently remain as inactive, as if we were bound by in∣visible chains; and we wonder by what charm the wheels of duty thus stop against our appa∣rent inclination; till we discover, that the spring of our will is broken, or naturally works the wrong way. Yes, it is not only unable to follow the good, that the understanding ap∣proves, but full of perverseness to pursue the evil, that reason disapproves: We are prone to do, contrary to our design, those things which breed remorse and wound conscience; and sooner or later, we may all say with the Heathen prin∣cess, who was going to murder her child,

<P>Nor is CONSCIENCE itself untainted. Alas! how slow is it to reprove in some cases! In others, how apt not to do it at all! In one per∣son, it is easy under mountains of guilt; and in another, it is unreasonably scrupulous about mere trifles: It either <HI>strains out a gnat,</HI> or <HI>swal∣lows a camel:</HI> When it is alarm'd, in some it shews itself ready to be made easy by every wrong method; in others▪ it obstinately refuses to be pacified by the right. To-day, you may with propriety compare it to a dumb dog, that does not bark at a thief; and to-morrow, to a snarling cur, that flies indifferently at a friend, a foe, or a shadow; and then madly turns upon himself, and tears his own flesh.</P>
<P>If Conscience, the best power of the uncon∣verted man, is so corrupt, good God! where
<PB N="80" REF="017930_0077_0FA37E693B6BEDE8"/>
are his AFFECTIONS? Almost perpetually de∣ficient in some, and excessive in others, when do they attain to, or stop at, the line of modera∣tion? Who can tell, how oft he has been the sport of their irregularity and violence? One hour we are hurried into rashness by their im∣petuosity; the next, we are bound in sloth by their inactivity. Sometimes every blast of fool∣ish hope, or ill-grounded fear; every gale of base desire, or unreasonable aversion; every wave of idolatrous love, or sinful hatred; every surge of misplaced admiration, or groundless horror; every billow of noisy joy, or undue sorrow, tosses, raises, or sinks our soul; as a ship in a storm, which has neither rudder nor ballast. At other times, we are totally be-calmed; all our sails are furled, not one breath of devout or human affection stirs in our stoical, frozen breast; and we remain stupidly insen∣sible, till the spark of temptation, dropping upon the combustible matter in our hearts, blows us up again into loud passion: And then, how dreadful and ridiculous together, is the new explosion!</P>
<P>If experience pronounces, that these reflexi∣ons are just, the point is gained.

<P>The danger of these complicated maladies of our souls, evidences itself by the most fatal of
<PB N="81" REF="017930_0078_0FA37E69F94E1EC8"/>
all symptoms, <HI>our manifest alienation from God.</HI> Yes, shocking as the confession is, we must make it, if truth has any dominion in our breast: Unrenewed man loves not his God. The eternal Beauty, for whose contemplation; the supreme Good, for whose enjoyment he was created, is generally forgotten, despised, or hated. If the thought of his holy Majesty presents it∣self, he looks upon it as an intruder: It lays him under as disagreeable a restraint, as that, which the presence of a grave, pious master puts upon a wanton, idle servant: Nor can he quietly pursue his sinful courses, till he has driven away the troublesome idea; or imagined with the Epicure a careless God, who wants resolution to call him to an account, and justice to punish him for his iniquity.</P>
<P>Does any one offer an indignity to his fa∣vourite friend, or only speak contemptibly of the object of his esteem, he feels as if he was the person insulted, and reddening with indig∣nation, directly espouses his cause: But every body, the meanest of his attendants not ex∣cepted, may with impunity insult the King of kings in his presence, and take the most pro∣fane liberties with his name and word, his laws and ministers: He hear<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the wild blasphemy, and regards it not; he sees the horrid outrage, and resents it not; and yet, amazing infatua∣tion! he pretends to love God.</P>
<P>If he goes to the play, he can fix his roving eyes, and wandering mind, three hours together upon the same trifling objects, not only without weariness, but with uncommon delight. If he has an appointment with the person whom he adores as a deity, his spirits are elevated, ex∣pectation and joy flutter in his dilated breast:
<PB N="82" REF="017930_0079_0FA37E6AB9FD98A8"/>
He sweetly anticipates the pleasing interview, or impatiently chides the slowly-flowing minutes: His feelings are inexpressible. But if he attends the great congregation, which he too often omits upon the most frivolous pretences, it is rather out of form and decency, than out of de∣votion and love; rather with indifference or re∣luctance, than with delight and transport. And when he is present there, how absent are his thoughts! How wandering his eyes! How trif∣ling, supine, irreverent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Men homage pay to men,</L>
<L>Thoughtless beneath whose dreadful eye they bow</L>

Were he to stare about when he gives them orders, as he does when he presents his supplications to the Lord of lords, he would be afraid that they would think he was half drunk, or had a touch of lunacy.</P>
<P>Suppose he still retains a sense of outward de∣cency, while the church goes through her so∣lemn offices; yet how heavy are his spirits! How heartless his confessions: how cold his prayers! the blessing comes at last, and he is blessed indeed—not with <HI>the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost,</HI> for that he gladly leaves to "poor enthusiasts," but with a release from his confinement and te∣dious work. And now that he has "done his duty, and served God," he hastes away to the company that suits his taste.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="017930_0080_0FA37E6B79529F20"/>See him there. Do not his very looks de∣clare, he is in his own element? With what eagerness of spirit, energy of gesture, and volu∣bility of tongue, does he talk over his last en∣tertainment, chase, or bargain? Does not the oil of chearfulness make all his motions as free and easy, as if weight and friction had no place at all in his light and airy frame?</P>
<P>Love of God, thou sweetest, strongest of all powers, didst thou ever thus metamorphose his soul, and impart such a sprightly activity to his body? And you that converse most familiarly with him, Did you ever hear him say, <HI>Come, and I will tell you what the Lord has done for my soul: Taste, and see how good the Lord is?</HI>—No, never; for <HI>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh:</HI> Nor can it be expected that God, who hath no place in his joyous reflecti∣ons, should have one in his chearful conversa∣tion. On the contrary, it will be matter of surprize to those who introduce the delightful subject of the love of God, if he does not wave it off, as dull, melancholy, or enthusiastical.</P>
<P>But as he will give you to understand, "he is no hypocrite, and therefore confines devotion to his closet," follow him there—Alas! he scarce ever bends the knee to <HI>Him that sees in secret:</HI> Or, if he says his prayers as regularly as he winds his watch, it is much in the same spirit: For, suppose he does not hurry them over, or cut them as short as possible; yet the careless, formal manner in which he offers them up, in∣dicates as plainly as his public conduct, the aversion lurking in his heart against God: And yet he fancies he loves Him: With a sneer that indicates self-applause, and a pharisaic con∣duct of others, Away with all your feelings
<PB N="84" REF="017930_0081_0FA37E6C3B40DE78"/>
and raptures, says he, <HI>This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments.</HI>" But alas! which of them does he keep? Certainly not the <HI>first</HI>— for the Lord is not the supreme object of his hopes and fears, his confidence and joy: Nor yet the <HI>last</HI>—for discontent and wrong desires are still indulged in his selfish and worldly heart. How unfortunate therefore is his appeal to the <HI>commandments,</HI> by which his secret enmity to the law, government, and nature of God is brought to the clearest light!</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="18" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD>XVIII. ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>But as the heart-felt love of God is supposed to be downright enthusiasm by some moralists, who, dashing in pieces the first table of the law against the second, pretend that all our duty to God consists in the love of our neighbour; let us examine the unconverted man's charity, and see whether he bears more love to his fellow-creatures than to his Creator.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more erroneous than his no∣tions of <HI>charity.</HI> He confounds it with the bare <HI>giving of alms</HI>; not considering that it is possible to do this kind of good, from the most selfish and <HI>uncharitable</HI> motives. Therefore, when the fear of being accounted covetous, the desire of passing for generous, the vanity of seeing his name in a list of noble subscribers, the shame of being outdone by his equals, the teazing impor∣tunity of an obstinate beggar, the moving ad∣dress of a solicitor whom he would blush to deny, or the pharisaic notion of making amends for his sins, and purchasing heaven by his alms—when any, I say, of these sinister motives set him upon assisting industrious poverty, re∣lieving
<PB N="85" REF="017930_0082_0FA37E6CF97EB060"/>
friendless old age, or supporting infirm and mutilated indigence, he fancies, that he gives an indubitable proof of his <HI>charity.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes too he affixes to that word, the idea of a fond hope, that every body is going to heaven: For if you intimate, that the rich vo∣luptuary is not with Lazarus in Abraham's bo∣som, and that the foolish virgins are not promis∣cuously admitted to glory with the wise, he won∣ders at. "your uncharitableness," and thanks God "he never entertained such unchristian thoughts of his neighbours."</P>
<P>He considers not, that <HI>charity</HI> is the fair off∣spring of the <HI>love of God,</HI> to which he is yet an utter stranger; and that it consists in an uni∣versal, disinterested benevolence to all mankind, our worst enemies not excepted: A benevo∣lence, that sweetly evidences itself by bearing with patience the evil which they do to us, and kindly doing them all the good we possibly can, both with respect to their soul and body, their property and reputation.</P>
<P>If this is a just definition of charity, the un∣renewed man has not even the outside of it. To prove it, I might appeal to his impatience and ill-humour, his unkind words and cutting ral∣leries (for I suppose him too moral ever to slan∣der or curse any one:) I might mention his su∣percilious behaviour to some, who are intitled to his affability as men, countrymen, and neigh∣bours: I might expatiate on his readiness to ex∣culpate, enrich, or aggrandize himself at the ex∣pence of <HI>others,</HI> whenever he can do it without exposing <HI>himself.</HI></P>
<P>But, waving all these particulars, I ask, Whom does he truly love? You answer, Doubtless the person to whom he makes daily protestations of
<PB N="86" REF="017930_0083_0FA37E6DBAD88B70"/>
the warmest regard."—But how does he prove this regard? Why, perhaps by the most artful insinuations, and dangerous attempts to rob her of her virtue. Perhaps he has already gained his end—Unhappy Magdalen! How much bet∣ter would it have been for thee, to have fallen into the hands of an highwayman? Thou wouldst only have lost thy money, but now thou art despoiled of the honour of thy sex, and the peace of thy mind: Thou art robbed at once of virgin innocence, a fair reputation, and pos∣sibly an healthy constitution. If this is a spe∣cimen of the unconverted man's love, what must be his hatred!</P>
<P>But I happily mistake: "He is no libertine, he has a virtuous wife, and amiable children, and he loves them, say you, with the tenderest af∣fection." I reply, that these relations, being <HI>immortal spirits,</HI> confined for a few years, in a tenement of clay, and continually on the re∣move for eternity; his laudable regard for their <HI>frail bodies,</HI> and proper care of their <HI>temporal prosperity,</HI> are not a sufficient proof, that he loves them in a right manner. For even ac∣cording to <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Nos nos corpora sumus: Corpus quidem vas est aut aliquo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> animi receptaculum.</P>

Does he regard it more than the body of his groom, or the life of his horse? Does he, with any degree of impor∣tunity, carry it daily in the arms of love and prayer, to the throne of grace for life and salva∣tion? Does he, by good instructions, and a vir∣tuous example, excite his children to secure an
<PB N="87" REF="017930_0084_0FA37E6E788F7630"/>
eternal inheritance? And is he at least as de∣sirous to see them wise and pious; as well-bred, rich, handsome, and great? Alas! I fear it is just the reverse. He is probably the first to poi∣son their tender minds, with some of the dan∣gerous maxims, that vanity and ambition have invented: And, supposing he has a favourite dog, it is well if he is not more anxious for the preservation of that one domestic animal, than for the salvation of all their souls.</P>
<P>If these observations are founded upon matter of fact, as daily experience demonstrates, I ap∣peal to common sense, and ask, Can the natural man, with all his fondness, be said to have a true love even for his nearest relatives? And is not the regard that he manifests for their <HI>bodies,</HI> more like the common instinct, by which doves cleave to their mates, and swallows provide for their young; than like the generous affection, which a rational creature ought to bear to im∣mortal SPIRITS, awfully hovering in a scale of probation, which is just going to turn for hell or heaven?</P>

<P>Nor is it surprizing, that the unrenewed man should be devoid of all true love to his nearest relations: For he is so compleatly fallen, that he bears no true love even to <HI>himself.</HI> Let us overlook those who cut their throats, shoot, drown, or hang themselves.

pleasure, that they leap after it even into the jaws of an untimely grave: Let us, I say, pass by those innumerable, unhappy victims of in∣temperance and debauchery, who squander their money upon panders and harlots, and have as little regard for their health, as for their fortune and reputation; and let us consider the case of those good-natured, decent persons, who profess to have a real value for both.</P>

<P>This depravity is productive of the most de∣testable brood. When it has suppressed the love of God, perverted the love of our neigh∣bour, and vitiated self-love; it soon gives birth to a variety of execrable tempers, and dire af∣fections, which should have no place but in the breasts of fiends, no outbreaking but in the chambers of hell.</P>
<P>If you ask their name, I answer—<HI>Pride,</HI> that odious vice, which feeds on the praises it flyly procures, lives by the applause it has meanly courted, and is equally stabb'd by the reproof of a friend, and the sneer of a foe.— <HI>The spirit of independence,</HI> which cannot bear controul, is galled by the easiest yoke, gnaws the slender cords of just authority, as if they were the heavy chains of tyrannical power; nor ever ceases struggling till they break, and he can say: "Now I am my own master."—<HI>Ambi∣tion</HI> and <HI>Vanity,</HI> which, like Proteus, take a thousand shapes, and wind a thousand ways, to climb up to the high seat of power, shine on the tottering stage of honour, wear the golden badge of fortune, glitter in the gaudy pomp of dress, and draw, by distinguishing appearances, the admiration of a gaping multitude.—<HI>Sloth,</HI> which unnerves the soul, enfeebles the body, and makes the whole man deaf to the calls of duty, loath to set about his business, (even when want, fear, or shame, drives him to it) ready to postpone or omit it upon any pretence, and wil∣ling to give up even the interests of society, vir∣tue and religion, so he may saunter undisturbed, doze the time away in stupid inactivity, or en∣joy himself in that dastardly indolence, which
<PB N="91" REF="017930_0088_0FA37E7179A54748"/>
passes in the world for quietness and good-nature. —<HI>Envy,</HI> that looks with an evil eye at the good things our competitors enjoy, takes a secret pleasure in their misfortunes, un∣der various pretexts exposes their faults, slyly tries to add to our reputation what it detracts from theirs, and stings our heart when they eclipse us by their greater success, or superior excellencies.—<HI>Covetousness,</HI> which is always dissatisfied with its portion, watches it with tormenting fears, increases it by every fordid mean, and, turning its own executioner, justly pines for want over the treasure, it madly saves for a prodigal heir.—<HI>Impatience,</HI> which frets at every thing, finds fault with every person, and madly tears herself under the distressing sense of a present evil, or the anxious expecta∣tion of an absent good.—<HI>Wrath,</HI> which dis∣torts our faces, racks our breasts, alarms our houshold, threatens, curses, stamps and storms even upon imaginary or trifling provocati∣ons. —<HI>Jealousy,</HI> that through a fatal skill in diabolical optics, sees contempt in all the words of a favourite friend, discovers infidelity in all his actions, lives upon the wicked suspicion it begets, and turns the sweets of the mildest pas∣sion into wormwood and gall.—<HI>Idolatrous love,</HI> which preys upon the spirits, consumes the flesh, tears the throbbing heart, and when it is disappointed, frequently forces its wretched slaves to lay violent hands upon themselves.— <HI>Hatred</HI> of our fellow-creatures, which keeps us void of tender benevolence, a chief ingredient in the bliss of angels; and fills us with some of the most unhappy sensations belonging to accursed spirits.—<HI>Malice,</HI> which takes an unnatural, hellish pleasure in teazing beasts, and hurting

<PB N="93" REF="017930_0090_0FA37E7300151A58"/>
she lays a deep plot for their sudden destruction; and with repeated oaths beseeches heaven to be witness of her artless innocence, while she moves the center of hell to accomplish her dire designs. The fatal hour is come; her stratagem has suc∣ceeded; and she now kisses and betrays, drinks health and poison; offers a friendly embrace, and gives a deadly stab.—<HI>Despair,</HI> who scorns to be beholden to mercy, gives the lie to all the declarations issued from the throne of grace, obstinately turns his wild eyes from the great expiatory sacrifice; and, at last, impatient to drink the cup of trembling, wildly looks for some weapon to destroy himself.—<HI>Distraction,</HI> begotten by the shocking mixture of two, or more of these infernal passions raised to the highest degree, of extravagance: <HI>Distraction,</HI> that wrings her hands, tears her dishevell'd hair, fixes her ghastly eyes, turns her swimming brains, quenches the last spark of reason; and, like a fierce tyger, must at last be chained by the hand of caution, and confined with iron bars in her dreary dwelling.</P>
<P>And, to close the dismal train, <HI>Self-murder,</HI> who always points wretched mortals to ponds and rivers, or presents them with cords, razors, pistols, daggers, and poison, and perpetually urges them to the choice of one of them.

He persuades, and his des∣perate victims, tired of the company of their
<PB N="94" REF="017930_0091_0FA37E73B9A7FE98"/>
fellow-mortals, fly for refuge to that of devils; they shut their eyes; and, horrible to say! but how much more horrible to do! deliberately venture from one hell into another, to seek ease; or, to speak with more truth, leap with all the miseries of a known hell, into all the horrors of one which is unknown.</P>
<P>And are your hearts, O ye sons of men, the favourite seats of this infernal crew? Then shame on the wretch that made the first panegy∣ric on the dignity of human nature? He proved my point: He began in <HI>Pride,</HI> and ended in <HI>Distraction.</HI></P>
<P>Detestable as these vices and tempers are, where is the natural man, that is always free from them? Where is even the child ten years old, who never felt most of these vipers, upon some occasion or other, shooting their venom through his lips, darting their baleful influence through his eyes, or at least stirring and hissing in his disturbed breast? If any one never felt them, he may be pronounced more than mortal: But if he has, his own experience furnishes him with a sensible demonstration, that he is a fallen spirit, infected with the poison that rages in the devil himself.</P>

<P>Bad roots, which vigorously shoot in the spring, will naturally produce their dangerous fruit in summer. We may therefore go one step further, and ask, Where is the man thirty years old, whose depravity has not broke out into the greatest variety of sinful acts? Among the persons of that age, who never were esteemed worse than their neighbours, shall we find a
<PB N="95" REF="017930_0092_0FA37E747934BEB0"/>
<HI>Forehead</HI> that never betrayed daring insolence?— A <HI>Check,</HI> that never indicated concealed guilt by an involuntary blush, or unnatural paleness?— A <HI>Neck,</HI> that never was stretched out in pride and vain confidence?—An <HI>Eye,</HI> that never cast a disdainful, malignant, or wanton look?—An <HI>Ear,</HI> that an evil curiosity never opened to frothy, loose, or defaming discourse?—A <HI>Tongue,</HI> that never was tainted with unedifying, false, in∣decent, or uncharitable language?—A <HI>Palate,</HI> that never became the seat of luxurious indul∣gence? —A <HI>Throat,</HI> that never was the channel of excess?—A <HI>Stomach,</HI> that never felt the op∣pressive load of abused mercies?—<HI>Hands,</HI> that never plucked, or touched the forbidden fruit of pleasing sin?—<HI>Feet,</HI> that never once moved in the broad, downward road of iniquity?—And a <HI>Bosom,</HI> that never heaved under the dreadful workings of some exorbitant passion?

And where a <HI>Body,</HI> however deformed, that ne∣ver was set up as a favourite idol, by the fallen spirit that inhabits it?</P>
<P>If iniquity thus works by all the powers, and breaks out through all the parts, of the human body; we may conclude by woful experience, not only that the plague of sin is begun, but that it rages with universal fury; and, to use again the evangelical prophet's words, that <HI>from the sole of the foot, even to the head</HI> of the natural man, <HI>there is no</HI> spiritual <HI>soundness</HI> in him, <HI>but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores.</HI></P>

<P>What can be said of each individual, may, with the same propriety, be affirmed of all the different nations of the earth. Let an impartial judge take four unconverted men, or children, from the four parts of the world: Let him exa∣mine their actions, and trace them back to their spring; and, if he makes some allowance for the accidental difference of their climate, con∣stitution, taste, and education; he will soon find their disposition as equally <HI>earthly, sensual,</HI> and <HI>devilish,</HI> as if they had all been cast in the same mould. Yes, as oak-trees are oaks all the world over, though by particular circum∣stances some grow taller and harder, and some more knotted and crooked than others: So all unregenerate men resemble one another; for all are proud, self-willed, impenitent, and <HI>lovers of pleasure, more than lovers of God.</HI></P>
<P>Do not sloth, gluttony, drunkenness, and uncleanness; cheating, defrauding, stealing, and oppression; lying, perjury, treachery, and cru∣elty, stalk openly, or lurk secretly every where?

<DIV4 TYPE="objections">
<HEAD>FIVE OBJECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. If the self-righteous moralist answers, that "sin and wickedness are not so universal as this argument supposes:" I reply, that the more we are acquainted with ourselves, with the history of the dead, and secret transactions of the living; the more we are convinced, that, if all are not guilty of <HI>outward</HI> enormities, all are deeply tainted with <HI>spiritual</HI> wickedness.</P>
<P>Even those excellent persons who, like Jere∣miah, have been in part <HI>sanctified before they came forth out of the womb,</HI> can from sad experience confess with him, that <HI>The heart is deceitful above all things,</HI> and say with David, <HI>My heart sheweth me the wickedness of the ungodly.</HI></P>
<P>Thousands indeed boast of the goodness of their hearts: They flatter themselves that to be righteous, it is enough to avoid the gross acts of intemperance and injustice: With the Pha∣risees they shut their eyes against the destructive
<PB N="98" REF="017930_0095_0FA37E76B8742DD0"/>
nature of the love of the world, the thirst of praise, the fear of men, the love of ease, sloth, sensuality, indevotion, self-righteousness, dis∣content, impatience, selfishness, carnal security, unbelief, hardness of heart, and a thousand other spiritual evils. Full of self-ignorance, like Pe∣ter, they imagine there is no combustible matter of wickedness in their breasts, because they are not actually fired by the spark of a suitable temptation. And when they hear what their corrupt nature may one day prompt them to, they cry out with Hazael, <HI>Am I a dog, that I should do this thing?</HI> Nevertheless by and by they do it, if not outwardly as he did, at least in their vain thoughts by day, or wicked, lewd imaginations by night. So true is the wise man's saying, <HI>He that trusteth his own heart is a fool.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II.
<Q>If historians give us frequent accounts of the notorious wickedness of mankind, (say the advocates for human excellence) it is because private virtue is not the subject of history; and to judge of the moral rectitude of the world by the corruption of courts, is as absurd as to estimate the health of a people from an infirmary.</Q></P>
<P>And is private vice any more the subject of history than private virtue? If it were, what folios would contain the fulsome and black ac∣counts of all the lies and scandal, the secret grudges and open quarrels, the filthy talking and malicious jesting, the unkind or unjust be∣haviour, the gross or refined intemperance, which deluge both town and country?</P>
<P>Suppose the annals of any one numerous fa∣mily were published, how many volumes might
<PB N="99" REF="017930_0096_0FA37E77794E0B40"/>
be filled with the detail of the undue fondness, or forbidding coldness; the variance, animosity, and strife, which break out between husbands and wives, parents and children, brothers and sisters, masters and domestics, upper and lower servants, &amp;c. What ridiculous, impertinent scenes would be opened to public view! What fretfulness, dissimulation, envy, jealousy, tale∣bearing, deceit! What concealed suspicions, aggravated charges, false accusations, underhand dealings, imaginary provocations, glaring par∣tiality, insolent behaviour, loud passions!</P>
<P>Was even the best moralist to write the me∣moirs of his own heart, and give the public a minute account of all his impertinent thoughts and wild imaginations, how many paragraphs would make him blush! How many pages, by presenting the astonished reader with a blank or a blot, would demonstrate the truth of St. Paul's assertion, <HI>They are all gone out of the way, there is none that doeth good,</HI> none but spoils his best works by a mixture of essential evil! Far then from finding <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the note [mark'd ‡] p. 76.</NOTE>
<Q>those vastly superior numbers, who in safe obscurity are virtuously and inno∣cently employed,</Q>
we may <HI>every where</HI> see the truth of the confession, which our objectors make in the church, "There is no health in us."</P>
<P>I say <HI>every where,</HI> for is cabal confined to the court, any more than lewdness to the army, and profaneness to the navy? Does not the same spirit of self-interest and intrigue which in∣fluences the choice of ministers of state, preside also at the election of members of parliament, mayors of corporate towns, burgesses of bo∣roughs, and petty officers in a country parish? We may then, (notwithstanding the unfor∣tunate
<PB N="100" REF="017930_0097_0FA37DCE03155A38"/>
comparison, on which this objection is founded) conclude without absurdity, that, as all men, sooner or later, by pain, sickness, and death, evidence their natural weakness and mor∣tality, whether they live in <HI>infirmaries,</HI> palaces, or cottages: So all men, sooner or later, by their thoughts, words and actions, demonstrate their natural corruption; whether they crowd the jail yard, the drawing room, or the obscure green of a country village.</P>
<P N="3">III. The same objectors will probably reply,
<Q>If corruption is universal, it cannot be said to be equal; for numbers lead a very harmless, and not a few a very useful life.</Q></P>
<P>To this I answer, that all have naturally <HI>an evil heart of unbelief,</HI> forgetful of, and <HI>departing from the living God.</HI> In this respect, <HI>there is no difference, all the world is guilty before God.</HI> But, thanks be to the Father of mercies, all do not remain so. Many cherish the seed of superna∣tural grace, which we have from the Redeemer; they bow to his scepter, become <HI>new creatures, depart from iniquity, and are zealous of good works.</HI> And the same gracious power that has renewed them, is at work upon thousands more; hourly restraining them from much evil, and daily ex∣citing them to many useful actions.</P>
<P>With respect to the harmlessness, for which some unrenewed persons are remarkable, it can∣not spring from a better nature than that of their fellow mortals; for the nature of all <HI>men,</HI> like that of all <HI>wolves,</HI> is the same throughout the whole species. It must then be owing to the restraining grace of God, or to a happier con∣stitution, a stricter education, a deeper sense of decency, or a greater regard for their character:
<PB N="101" REF="017930_0098_0FA37DCEBA6CF478"/>
perhaps only to the fear of consequences, and to the want of natural boldness, or of a suitable temptation and fair opportunity to sin. Nor are there few, who pass for temperate, merely because the diabolical pride lurking in their heart, scorns to stoop so low, as to indulge their beastly appetites: While others have the undeserved reputation of good-natured, because they find more delight in quietly gratifying their sheepish indolence or brutal desires, than in yielding to the uneasy, boisterous tempers, which they have in common with devils.</P>
<P>As to the virtues by which some of the un∣converted distinguish themselves from others, they either spring from God's preventing grace, or are only vices in disguise. The love of praise, the desire of honour, and the thirst of gold, ex∣cite thousands to laudable designs, and useful actions. Wicked men, set on work by these powerful springs, do lying wonders in the mo∣ral world, as the magycians did in the land of Egypt. They counterfeit divine grace, and for a time seem even to outdo believers themselves. Hence it is, that we frequently see the indolent industrious, the coward brave, the covetous charitable, the pharisee religious, the Magdalen modest, and the dastardly slave of his lusts a bold asserter of public liberty. But the searcher of hearts is not deceived by fair appearances: He judges of their actions according to the mo∣tives whence they spring, and the ends for which they are performed: <HI>You are,</HI> says he to all these seemingly virtuous sinners, <HI>like whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but within are full of dead mens' bones, and of all uncleanness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="017930_0099_0FA37DCF7A4290E8"/>Were I to describe these saints of the world by a comparison, I would say, that some of them resemble persons, who artfully conceal their ul∣cers, under the most agreeable appearance of cleanliness and health. Many that admire their faces and looks, little suspect what a putrid, vi∣rulent fluid runs out of their <HI>secret</HI> sores. Others of them, whose hypocrisy is not of so gross a kind, are like persons infected with a mortal disease, who, though the mass of their blood is tainted, and some noble part attacked, still walk about, do business, and look as fresh-coloured as if they were the picture of health. Ye sons of Aesculapius, who, without feeling their pulse, and carefully weighing every symptom, pro∣nounce them very well upon their look alone, do ye not blunder in physic, just as my object∣ors do in divinity?</P>
<P N="4">IV. But still they urge, that
<Q>It is wrong to father our sinfulness upon a pretended natural depravity, when it may be entirely owing to the force of ill example, the influence of a bad education, or the strong ferment of youthful blood.</Q></P>
<P>All these, I reply, like rich soil and rank ma∣nure, cause original corruption to shoot the higher, but do not form its pernicious seeds. That these seeds lurk within the heart, before they are forced up by the heat of temptation, appears indubitable, if we consider, 1. That all children, on particular occasions, manifest some early inclination to those sins, which the feeble∣ness of their bodily organs, and the want of proper ferments in their blood, do not permit them to commit: 2. That infants betray envy, ill-humour, impatience, selfishness, anger, and
<PB N="103" REF="017930_0100_0FA37DD03A64CE88"/>
obstinacy, even before they can take particular notice of ill examples, and understand bad counsels: And, 3. That though uncleanness, fornication, and adultery, on account of the shame and danger attending them, are commit∣ted with so much secrecy, that the <HI>examples</HI> of them are seldom, if ever, given in public; they are nevertheless some of the crimes which are most universally or eagerly committed.</P>
<P>Besides, if we were not more inclined to vice than virtue, good examples would be as com∣mon, and have as much force, as bad ones. Therefore, the generality of bad examples can∣not arise but from the general sinfulness of man; and to account for this general sinfulness by the generality of bad examples, is <HI>begging</HI> the que∣stion, and not <HI>proving</HI> the point.</P>
<P>Add to this, that as weeds, since the curse, grow even in fields sown with the best wheat; so vice, since the fall, grows in the midst of the best examples, and the most excellent educa∣tion: Witness the barbarous crimes committed by pious Jacob's children, and penitent Adam's eldest son.</P>
<P N="5">V.
<Q>But if Cain sinned, say our objectors, and all mankind sin also, it is no more than Adam himself once did by his own free choice, though he was created as exempt from original depravity as an angel. What need is there then to suppose, that he com∣municated to his posterity an inbred prone∣ness to sin?</Q></P>
<P>To this I reply, It is not one accident or single event, but a continual repetition of the same event, that proves a proneness. If a man, who is perfectly in his senses, by some unfore∣seen
<PB N="104" REF="017930_0101_0FA37DD0F8A56B48"/>
accident falls into a fit of madness, we may account for his misfortune from that accident; and no certain judgment can be formed of the bodily habit of his family. But if all his chil∣dren, through an hundred generations, are not only subject to the same mad fits, but also die in consequence of them, in all sorts of climates, and under all sorts of physicians; common sense will not allow us to doubt, that it is <HI>now</HI> a family disorder, incurable by human art. The man is Adam, the family mankind, and the madness sin. Reader! you are desired to make the application.</P>

<P><Q>But all are not employed in sin and wick∣edness, for many go through a constant round of <HI>innocent diversions</HI>; and these, at least, must be <HI>innocent</HI> and <HI>happy.</HI></Q>
—Let us then consider the amusements of mankind: Or rather, with∣out stopping to look at the wise dance of the Is∣raelites round the golden calf, and the modest, sober, and humane diversions of the Heathens, in the festivals of their lewd, drunken, and bloody gods; let us only see, how far <HI>our own</HI> pleasures demonstrate the <HI>innocence</HI> and <HI>happiness</HI> of mankind.</P>
<P>How excessively foolish are the plays of chil∣dren! How full of mischief and cruelty the sports of boys! How vain, foppish, and frothy the joys of young people! And how much be∣low the dignity of upright, pure creatures, the snares that persons of different sexes perpetually lay for each other! When they are together, is not this their favourite amusement, till they
<PB N="105" REF="017930_0102_0FA37DD1BA25D570"/>
are deservedly caught in the net, which they imprudently spread? But see them asunder.</P>
<P>Here, a circle of idle women, supping a de∣coction of Indian herbs, talk or laugh all toge∣ther, like so many chirping birds or chattering monkies, and, scandal excepted, every way to as good purpose.—And there, a club of graver men blow, by the hour, clouds of stinking smoke out of their mouth, or wash it down their throat with repeated draughts of intoxicating liquors. The strong fumes have already reached their heads; and while some stagger home, others triumphantly keep the field of excess; though one is already stamped with the heaviness of the ox, another worked up to the fierceness and roar of the lion, and a third brought down to the fil∣thiness of the vomiting dog.</P>
<P>Leave them at their <HI>manly</HI> sport, to follow those musical sounds, mixed with a noise of stamping; and you will find others profusely per∣spiring, and violently fatiguing themselves, in skipping up and down a room for a whole night, and ridiculously turning their backs and faces to each other an hundred different ways. Would not a man of sense prefer running ten miles upon an <HI>useful</HI> errand, to this useless man∣ner of losing his rest, heating his blood, ex∣hausting his spirits, unfitting himself for the duties of the following day, and laying the foundation of a putrid fever or a consumption, by breathing the midnight air, corrupted by clouds of dust, by the unwholesome fumes of candles, and by the more pernicious steam, that issues from the body of many persons, who use a strong exercise in a confined place.</P>
<P>In the next room indeed they are more quiet, but are they more rationally employed? Why
<PB N="106" REF="017930_0103_0FA37DD27A43E0D8"/>
do they so earnestly rattle those ivory cubes; and so anxiously study those packs of loose and spotted leaves? Is happiness graven upon the one, or stamped upon the other? Answer, ye Gamesters, who curse your stars, as ye go home with an empty purse and a heart full of rage.</P>

You are not then so well employed as the foolish Heathen empe∣ror, who amused himself in killing troublesome flies and wearisome time together. The delight of rational creatures, much more of Christians on the brink of the grave, is to redeem, im∣prove, and solidly enjoy time; but yours, alas! consists in the bare, irreparable <HI>loss</HI> of that in∣valuable treasure.

In cities, some are lavish of the gold, which should be laid by for the payment of their debts, or the relief of the poor, to buy an opportunity of acting under a mask an imperti∣nent or immodest part, without a blush; and others are guilty of the same injustice or prodi∣gality, that they may be entitled to the honour of waiting upon a company of idle buffoons,
<PB N="107" REF="017930_0104_0FA37DD33A0D2CF0"/>
and seeing them act what would make a modest woman blush, or hearing them speak what per∣sons of true piety, or pure morals, would gladly pay them never to utter.</P>
<P>Are <HI>country</HI> amusements more rational and in∣nocent? What shall we say of those Christian, or rather Heathenish, festivals, called <HI>Wakes,</HI> annually kept in honour of the saint to whom the parish church was formerly dedicated? Are they not celebrated with the idleness, vanity, and debauchery of the Floralia; with the noise, riots, and frantic mirth of the Bacchanals; ra∣ther than with the decent solemnity, pious chearfulness, and strict temperance, which cha∣racterise the religion of the holy Jesus?</P>
<P>The assizes are held, the judge passes an awful sentence of transportation or death upon guilty wretches who stand pale and trembling before his tribunal; and twenty couple of gay gentlemen and ladies, as if they rejoiced in the infamy and destruction of their fellow mortals, hire on the occasion a band of musicians, and dance all night, perhaps in the very apartment where the distracted victims of justice a few hours before wrung their hands, and rattled their irons.</P>
<P>The <HI>Races</HI> are advertised, all the country is in motion, neither business, rain, nor storm, can prevent thousands from running for miles, and sometimes through the worst of roads, to feast their eyes upon the danger of their fellow creatures, and divert themselves with the misery of the most useful animals. Daring mortals hazard their necks upon swift coursers, which are tortured by the severest lashes of the whip, and incessant pricks or tearing gashes of the spur▪ that they may exert their utmost force,
<PB N="108" REF="017930_0105_0FA37DD405166DE0"/>
strain every nerve, and make continued efforts even beyond the powers of nature: Whence (to say nothing of the fatal accidents, which yet, alas! too frequently happen) they sometimes pant away their wretched lives in a bath of sweat and blood; and all this, that they may afford a barbarous pleasure to their idle, wanton, and barbarous beholders.</P>
<P>In one place the inhuman sport is afforded by an unhappy bird, fixed at some distance, that the sons of cruelty may long exercise their mer∣ciless skill, in its lingering and painful destruc∣tion: Or by two of them trained up, and high fed for the battle. The hour fixed for the ob∣stinate engagement is come; and, as if it was not enough that they should pick each other's eyes out, with the strong bills that nature has given them, human malice, or rather diabolical cruelty, comes to the assistance of their native fierceness. Silver spurs, or steel talons, sharper than those of the eagle, are barbarously fastened to their feet: Thus armed, they are excited to leap at each other, and in an hundred repeated onsets to tear their feathers and flesh, as if they were contending vultures; and if at last one blinded, covered with blood and wounds, and unable to stand any longer the metallic claws of his antagonist, enters into the agonies of death; the numerous ring of stamping, clapping, shout∣ing, eagerly betting, or horridly cursing specta∣tors, is as highly delighted, as if the tortured, dying creature, was the common enemy of mankind.</P>
<P>In another place, a multitude of spectators is delightfully entertained by two brawny men, who unmercifully knock one another down, as if they were oxen appointed for the slaughter,
<PB N="109" REF="017930_0106_0FA37DD4BB953838"/>
and continue the savage play, till one, with his flesh bruised and his bones shattered, bleeding, and gasping as in the pangs of death, yields to his antagonist, and thus puts an end to the shocking sport.</P>
<P>But it is perhaps a different spectacle, that recommends itself to the bloody taste of our bap∣tized Heathens. Fierce dogs are excited by fiercer men, with fury to fasten upon the nose, or tear out the eyes, of a poor confined animal, which pierces the sky with his painful and la∣mentable bellowings, enough to force compas∣sion from the heart of barbarians, not totally lost to all sense of humanity; whilst in the mean time the surrounding, savage mob, rends the very heavens with the most horrid imprecations, and repeated shouts of applauding joy; sporting themselves with that very misery, which human nature (were it not deplorably corrupted) would teach them to alleviate. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q>I ever thought, says judge Hale, in his Con∣templations, that there is a certain degree of jus∣tice due from man to the creatures, as from man to man; and that an excessive use of the crea∣ture's labour is an injustice, for which he must ac∣count. I have therefore always esteemed it as a part of my duty, and it has been always my practice to be merciful to my beasts; and upon the same account I have declined any cruelty to any of thy creatures, and, as much as I might, prevented it in others as a tyranny. I have ab∣horred those sports that consist in the torturing of thy creatures; and if any noxious creature must be destroyed, or creatures for food must be taken, it has been my practice to do it in the manner that may be with the least torture or cruelty to the creature; ever remembering, that though God has given us a dominion over his creatures, yet it is under a law of justice, prudence, and modera∣tion; otherwise we should become <HI>tyrants,</HI> and not <HI>lords,</HI> over God's creatures; and therefore those things of this nature which others have <HI>practised as recreations,</HI> I have <HI>avoided as sins.</HI></Q></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>XXIV. ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The total corruption of our nature appears, not only in the inclination of mankind to pur∣sue irrational, and cruel amusements; but in their general propensity to commit the most <HI>un∣profitable, ridiculous, inhuman, impious,</HI> and <HI>dia∣bolical</HI> sins.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> The most <HI>unprofitable:</HI> For instance, that of sporting in profane oaths and curses with the tremendous name of the Supreme Being. <HI>Be∣cause of swearing the land mourneth,</HI> said a pro∣phet thousands of years ago; and what land even in Christendom, yea what parish in this reformed island mourns not, or ought not to
<PB N="111" REF="017930_0108_0FA37DD639D2E6F8"/>
mourn, for the same provoking crime?—a crime, which is the hellish offspring of practical athe∣ism, and heathenish insolence—a crime, that brings neither profit, honour, nor pleasure, to the profane wretch who commits it—a crime, for which he may be put to open shame, forced to appear before a magistrate, and sent for ten days to the house of correction, unless he pays an ignominious fine; and what is more awful still—a crime, which, if persisted in, will one day cause him to gnaw his impious tongue in the severest torments. Surely man, who drinks this insipid, and yet destructive iniquity like water, must have his moral taste strangely vitia∣ted, not to say, diabolically perverted.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> The most <HI>ridiculous</HI> sins. In what country, town, or village, do not women be∣tray their silly vanity? Is it not the same fool∣ish disposition of heart, which makes them bore their ears in Europe, and slit their noses in America, that they may unnaturally graft in their flesh pieces of glass, shining pebbles, glit∣tering gold, or trinkets of meaner metal? And when female Hottentots fancy they add to the importance of their filthy person, by some yards of the bloody intestines of a beast, twisted round their arms or necks, do they not evidence the very spirit of the ladies in our hemisphere, who too often measure their dignity by the yards of coloured silk bands, with which they crown themselves, and turn the grave matron into a pitiful may-queen?</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> The most <HI>inhuman</HI> sins.
<Q>An hundred thousand mad animals, whose heads are co∣vered with hats,</Q>
says Voltaire,
<Q>advance to kill, or to be killed by, the like number of their fellow mortals covered with turbans.
<PB N="112" REF="017930_0109_0FA37DD6F8A023B8"/>
By this strange procedure they want, at best, to decide whether a tract of land, to which none of them all lays any claim, shall belong to a certain man whom they call Sultan, or to another whom they name Caesar, neither of whom ever saw, or will see, the spot so furiously contended for: And very few of those creatures who thus mutually butcher one another, ever beheld the animal for whom they cut each others throats. From time immemorial this has been the way of mankind almost over all the earth. What an excess of madness is this! And how de∣servedly might a Superior Being crush to atoms this earthly ball, the bloody nest of such ridiculous murderers!</Q></P>
<P>The same author makes elsewhere the fol∣lowing reflections, on the same melancholy sub∣ject:
<Q>Famine, pestilence, and war, are the three most famous ingredients of this lower world. The two first come from God; but the last, in which all three concur, comes from the imagination of princes or ministers. A king fancies, that he has a right to a dis∣tant province. He raises a multitude of men, who have nothing to do, and nothing to lose; gives them a red coat and a laced hat, and makes them wheel to the right, wheel to the left, and march to glory. Five or six of these belligerent powers sometimes engage together, three against three, or two against four: But whatever part they take, they all agree in one point, which is, to do their neighbour all possible mischief. The most astonishing thing, belonging to their infernal undertaking, is, that every ring-leader of those murderers, gets his colours consecrated,
<PB N="113" REF="017930_0110_0FA37DD7B97142E0"/>
and solemnly blessed in the name of God, before he marches up to the destruction of his fellow creatures. If a chief warrior has had the good fortune of getting only two or three thousand men slaughtered, he does not think it worth his while to thank God for it: But if ten thousand have been destroyed by fire and sword, and if (to compleat his good fortune) some capital city has been totally overthrown, a day of public thanks∣giving is appointed on the joyful occasion. Is not that a fine art which carries such de∣solation through the earth; and, one year with another destroys forty thousand men, out of an hundred thousand!</Q></P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> The most <HI>impious</HI> sins; for instance, that of <HI>idolatry:</HI> "Before the coming of Christ," says a late divine,
<Q>all the polite and barbarous nations among the Heathens, plunged into it with equal blindness. And the Jews were so strongly wedded to it, that God's miracu∣lous interposition, both by dreadful judge∣ments and astonishing mercies, could not for 800 years restrain them from committing it in the grossest manner.</Q></P>
<P>Nor need we look at either Heathens or Jews, to see the proneness of mankind to that detest∣able crime; Christians alone can prove the charge. To this day, the greatest part of them pray to dead men and dead women; bow to images of stone, and crosses of wood; and make, adore, and swallow down, the wafer-god: And those, who pity them for this ridiculous idola∣try, till converting grace interposes, daily <HI>set up their idols in their hearts,</HI> and, without going to the plain of D<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra, sacrifice all to the king's <HI>golden</HI> image.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="017930_0111_0FA37DD883D33B98"/>And 5<HI>thly.</HI> The most <HI>diabolical</HI> sin: <HI>Persecution,</HI> that favourite offspring of <HI>Satan transformed into an angel of light. Persecution,</HI> that bloody, hy∣pocritical monster, which carries a bible, a li∣turgy, and a bundle of canons in one hand; with fire, faggots, and all the weapons invented by cruelty in the other; and with sanctified looks distresses, racks, or murders men, either because they love God, or because they cannot all think alike.</P>
<P>Time would fail to tell of those, who, on re∣ligious accounts, have been stoned and sawn asunder by the Jews, cast to the lions and burnt by the Heathens, strangled and impal'd by the Mahometans, and butchered all manner of ways by the Christians.</P>
<P>Yes, we must confess it, Christian Rome hath glutted herself with the blood of martyrs, which Heathenish Rome had but comparatively tasted: And when Protestants fled from her bloody pale, they brought along with them too much of her bloody spirit. Prove the sad assertion, poor Servetus: When Romish inquisition had forced thee to fly to Geneva, what reception didst thou meet with in that reformed city? Alas! the Papists had burned thee in effigy, the Pro∣testants burned thee in reality, and Moloch tri∣umphed to see the two opposite parties agree in offering him the human sacrifice.</P>
<P>So universally restless is the spirit of persecu∣tion, which inspires the unrenewed part of man∣kind, that when people of the same religion have no outward opposer to tear, they bark at, bite, and devour one another. Is it not the same bitter zeal, that made the Pharisees and Sadducees among the Jews, and now makes the sects of Ali and Omar among the Mahometans,
<PB N="115" REF="017930_0112_0FA37DD93A241438"/>
those of the Jansenists and Molinists among the Papists, and those of the Calvinists and Armi∣nians among the Protestants, oppose each other with such acrimony and virulence?</P>
<P>But let us look around us at home: When persecuting Popery had almost expired in the fires, in which it burned our first church-men, how soon did those who survived them com∣mence persecutors of the Presbyterians? When these, forced to fly to New-England for rest, got there the staff of power in their hand, did they not in their turn fall upon, and even hang the Quakers? And now that an act of tolera∣tion binds the monster, and the lash of pens consecrated to the defence of our civil and reli∣gious liberties, makes him either afraid or ashamed of roaring aloud for his prey; does he not shew, by his supercilious looks, malicious sneers, and settled contempt of vital piety, what he would do, should an opportunity offer? And does he not still, under artful pretences, go to the utmost length of his chain, to wound the re∣putation of those, whom he cannot devour, and inflict at least <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Pietas Oxoniensis.</NOTE> <HI>academic death</HI> upon those whose person is happily secured from his rage?</P>
<P>O ye unconverted among mankind, if all these abominations every where break out upon you; what cages of unclean birds, what nests swarming with cruel vipers, are your <HI>deceitful and desperately wicked hearts!</HI></P>

with a variety of shocking aggravations! Yes, mankind are prone to sin:</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Immediately,</HI> by a kind of evil instinct: As children, who peevishly strike the very breast they suck; and betray the rage of their little hearts, by sobbing and swelling, sometimes till, by forcing their bowels out of their place, they bring a rupture upon themselves; and fre∣quently till they are black in the face, and al∣most suffocated.—II. <HI>Deliberately,</HI> as those, who having life and death clearly set before them, wilfully, obstinately chuse the way that leads to certain destruction.—III. <HI>Repeatedly,</HI> witness li∣ars, who, because their crime costs them but a breath, frequently commit it at every breath.— IV. <HI>Continually,</HI> as rakes, who would make their whole life one uninterrupted scene of debauchery, if their exhausted strength, or purse, did not force them to intermit their lewd practices; though not without a promise to renew them again, at the first convenient opportunity.— V. <HI>Treacherously,</HI> as those Christians, who forget divine mercies, and their own repeated resolu∣tions, break through the solemn vows and pro∣mises made in their sacraments, and, sinning with an high hand <HI>against their profession,</HI> perfi∣diously fly in the face of their conscience, the church, and their Saviour.—VI. <HI>Daringly,</HI> as those who steal under the gallows, openly insult their parents or their king, laugh at all laws hu∣man and divine, and put to defiance all, that are invested with power to see them executed.— VII. <HI>Triumphantly,</HI> as the vast number of those, who glory in their shame, found aloud the trumpet of their own wickedness, and boast of their horrid, repeated debaucheries, as admirable, and praise-worthy deeds.—VIII. <HI>Progressively,</HI> till
<PB N="117" REF="017930_0114_0FA37DDABA513EB8"/>
they have filled up the measure of their iniqui∣ties, as <HI>individuals</HI>; witness Judas, who from covetousness, proceeded to hypocrisy, theft, trea∣son, despair and self-murder: Or, as a <HI>nation</HI>; witness the Jews, who, after despising and kill∣ing their prophets, rejected the Son of God; affirmed he was <HI>mad</HI>; stigmatized him with the name of <HI>Deceiver</HI>; said, he was <HI>Beelzebub</HI> him∣self; offered him all manner of indignities; bought his blood; prayed it might be on them, and their children; rested not, till they had put the <HI>Prince of Life</HI> to the most ignominious death; and, horrible to say! made sport with the groans, which rent the rocks around them, and threw the earth into convulsions under their feet.—IX. <HI>Unnaturally:</HI> 1. By <HI>astonishing barbari∣ties:</HI> As the women who murder their own children; the Greeks and Romans, who ex∣posed them to be the living prey of wild beasts: the savages, who knock their aged parents on the head; the Canibals, who roast and eat their prisoners of war; and some revengeful people, who, to taste all the sweetness of their devilish passion, have murdered their enemy, and eaten up his liver and heart. 2. By the most <HI>diabolical superstition:</HI> As the Israelites, who, when they had <HI>learned the works of the Heathens, sacrificea their sons and their daughters to devils</HI>; and by the horrible practices of witchcraft, endeavoured to raise, and deal with, infernal spirits. And, 3. by the most <HI>preposterous gratifications of sense:</HI> Witness the incests <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reason, which engaged the publisher of these sheets to preach to some of the colliers in his neighbourhood, was the horrid length they went in immorality.

this land; the infamous fires, which drew fire and brimstone down from heaven upon accursed cities; and the horrid lusts of the Canaanites, though, alas! not confined to Canaan; which gave birth to the laws recorded Lev. xviii. 7, 23. and xx. 16. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In the last century an Irish bishop was clearly convicted of the crime forbidden in those laws, and suffered death for it.</NOTE> Laws that are at once the dis∣grace of mankind, and the proof of my asser∣tion. —X.

<HEAD>XXVI. ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>If the force of a torrent may be known by the height and number of the banks, which it overflows; the strength of this corruption will be rightly estimated from the high and numerous dikes raised to stem it, which it nevertheless continually breaks through.</P>
<P>Ignorance and debauchery, injustice and im∣piety, in all their shapes, still overspread the whole earth; notwithstanding innumerable means used, in all ages, to suppress and prevent them.</P>
<P>The almost total extirpation of mankind by the deluge, the fiery showers that consumed So∣dom, the ten Egytian plagues, the entire exci∣sion of whole nations who were once famous for their wickedness, the captivities of the Jews, the destruction of thousands of cities and king∣doms, and millions of more private judgments, never fully stopped immorality in any one country.</P>
<P>The striking miracles wrought by prophets, the alarming sermons preached by divines, the infinite number of good books published in al∣most all languages, and the founding of myriads of churches, religious houses, schools, colleges, and universities, have not yet caused impiety to hide its brazen face any where. The making of all sorts of excellent laws, the appointing of magistrates and judges to put them in force, the forming of associations for the reformation of manners, the filling of thousands of prisons, and erecting of millions of racks and gallows, have not yet suppressed one vice.</P>
<P>And what is most amazing of all, the life, miracles, sufferings, death, and heavenly doc∣trine of the Son of God; the labours, writings,
<PB N="120" REF="017930_0117_0FA37DDCFA47C108"/>
and martyrdom of his disciples; the example and intreaties of millions that have lived and died in the faith; the inexpressible horrors and frightful warnings of thousands of wicked men, who have testified in their last moments, that they had work'd out their damnation, and were just going to their own place; the blood of my∣riads of martyrs, the strivings of the Holy Spi∣rit, the dreadful curses of the law, and the glo∣rious promises of the gospel—All these means together, have not extirpated immorality and profaneness out of one single town or village in all the world; no, nor out of one single family for any length of time. And this will probably continue to be the desperate case of mankind, till the Lord lays to his powerful hand; seconds these means by the <HI>continued</HI> strokes of the sword of his Spirit; <HI>pleads by fire and sword with all flesh</HI>; and, according to his promise, causes <HI>righteousness to cover the earth, as the waters cover the sea.</HI></P>
<P>Is not this a demonstration founded on mat∣ter of fact, that human corruption is not only deep as the ocean; but impetuous as an over∣flowing river, which breaks down all its banks, and leaves marks of devastation in every place? This will still appear in a clearer light, if we consider the strong opposition, which our na∣tural depravity makes to divine grace in the un∣converted.</P>

<P>When the Lord, by the rod of affliction, <HI>the sword of the Spirit,</HI> and the power of his grace, attacks the hard heart of a sinner, how obsti∣nately does he resist the sharp, though gracious
<PB N="121" REF="017930_0118_0FA37DDDB9F30D70"/>
operation! To make an honourable and vigor∣ous defence, he puts on the shining robes of his formality; he stands firm in the boasted armour of his moral powers; he <HI>daubs with untempered mortar</HI> the ruinous <HI>wall</HI> of his conduct; with self-righteous resolutions, and pharisaic profes∣sions of virtue, he builds, as he thinks, an im∣pregnable tower; he musters and draws up in battle array his poor works, artfully putting in the front those that make the finest appearance, and carefully concealing the vices, which he can neither disguise, nor dress up in the regi∣mentals of virtue.</P>
<P>In the mean time he prepares <HI>the carnal wea∣pon of</HI> his <HI>warfare,</HI> and raises the battery of objections to silence the truth that begins to gall him. He affirms,

till, he sees the Jews and Heathens fixed even upon Christ and St. Paul the very same opprobrious name: He calls it a 'new doctrine;' till he is obliged to acknow∣ledge it is as old as the reformers, the apostles, and the prophets: He says,
<Q>it is fancy, delu∣sion, enthusiasm;</Q>
till the blessed effects of it, on true believers, constrain him to drop the trite and slanderous assertion: He declares, that
<Q>it drives people out of their senses, or makes them melancholy;</Q>
till he is compelled to confess, that <HI>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,</HI> and that none are so happy and joy∣ful, as those who truly love, and zealously serve God: He urges, that 'it destroys good works;' till a sight of the readiness of believers, and of his own backwardness, to perform them, makes him ashamed of the groundless accusation: He will tell you twenty times over,
<Q>there is no need of so much ado;</Q>
till he discovers the
<PB N="122" REF="017930_0119_0FA37DDE7A268920"/>
folly of being careless on the brink of <HI>eternal ruin,</HI> and observes, that the nearness of <HI>temporal danger</HI> puts him upon the utmost exertion of all his powers. Perhaps, to get himself a name among his profane companions, he lampoons the scripture, or <HI>casts out firebrands and arrows</HI> against the despised disciples of Jesus,
<Q>they are all poor and illiterate,</Q>
says he,
<Q>fools or knaves, cheats and hypocrites,</Q>
&amp;c. &amp;c. till the word of God stops his mouth, and he sees himself the greatest hypocrite, with whom he is acquainted.</P>
<P>When, by such heavy charges, he has long kept off the truth from his heart, and the ser∣vants of God from his company, this kind of ammunition begins to fail; and he barricades himself with the fear of being undone in his circumstances, till experience convinces him, that <HI>No good thing shall God with-hold from them that live a godly life,</HI> and that <HI>All things shall be added to them, who seek first the kingdom of God.</HI> He then hides himself in the crowd of the un∣godly, and says, 'if he perishes, many will share the same fate;' till he sees the glaring absurdity of going to hell for the sake of company. He shelters at last under the protection of the rich, the great, the learned despisers of Christ and the cross; till the mines of their wickedness spring∣ing on all sides around him, make him fly <HI>to the sanctuary of the Lord</HI>; and <HI>there he</HI> sees the ways, and <HI>understands the end of these men.</HI></P>
<P>When all his batteries are silenced, and a breach is made in his conscience, he looks out for some secret way to leave Sodom, without be∣ing taken notice of, and derided by those who fight under Satan's banner; and the fear of be∣ing taken for one of them that <HI>fly from the wrath to come,</HI> and openly take the part of an holy

<P>Are the outworks taken, has he been forced to part with his gross immoralities, he has ge∣nerally recourse to a variety of stratagems: Sometimes he publicly dismisses Satan's garri∣son, <HI>fleshly lusts which war against the godly,</HI> and keep under the ungodly <HI>soul</HI>; but it is only to let them in again secretly, either one by one, or with forces <HI>seven</HI> times greater, <HI>so that his last state is worse than the first.</HI> At other times he hoists up the white flag of truth, apparently yields to conviction, favours the ministers of the gospel, admits the language of Canaan, and warmly contends for evangelical doctrines: But alas! the place has not surrendered, his heart is not given up to God: spiritual wickedness, under fair shows of zeal, still keeps possession for <HI>the god of this world</HI>; and the shrewd hypo∣crite artfully imitates the behaviour of a true Israelite, just as <HI>Satan transforms himself into an angel of light.</HI></P>
<P>Is he at last deeply convinced, that the only mean of escaping destruction, and capitulating to advantage, is to deliver up the traitor <HI>Sin?</HI> Yet what a long parley does he hold about it! What a multitude of plausible reasons does he advance, to put it off from day to day!
<Q>He is yet young—The Lord is merciful — All have their foibles—We are here in an imperfect state — It is a little sin — It may be consistent with loyalty to God—It hurts no body but himself—Many pious men were once guilty of it—By and by he will repent as they did, &amp;c.</Q>
When louder summons and increasing fears com∣pel him to renounce <HI>the lusts of the flesh,</HI> how strongly does he plead for <HI>those of the mind!</HI> And
<PB N="124" REF="017930_0121_0FA37DDFF9070790"/>
after he has given up his bosom-sin with his lips, how treacherously does he hide it in the inmost recesses of his heart!</P>
<P>Never did a besieged town dispute the ground with such obstinacy, and hold out by such a va∣riety of stratagems, as corrupt man stands it out against the repeated attacks of truth and grace. If he yields at all, it is seldom before he is brought to the greatest extremity. He <HI>feeds on the dust of the earth</HI>; he tries to <HI>fill his</HI> soul <HI>with the husks</HI> of vanity; and fares hard on sounds, names, forms, opinions, withered experience, dry notions of faith, and empty professions of hope, and fawn∣ing shows of love, till the <HI>mighty famine arises,</HI> and the intolerable want of substantial bread, forces him to surrender at discretion, and with∣out reserve.</P>
<P>Some stand it out thus, against the God of their salvation, ten or twenty years; and others never yield, till the terrors of death storm their affrighted souls, their last sickness batters down their tortured bodies, and <HI>the poison of the arrows of the Almighty drinks up their wasted spirits.</HI> What a strong proof is this, of the inveteracy and obstinacy of our corruption!</P>

<P>But a still stronger may be drawn, from the amazing struggles of God's children with their depravity; even after they have, through grace, powerfully subdued, and gloriously triumphed over it.

<P>When evidences of the most opposite interest, agree in their deposition of a matter of fact, its truth is greatly corroborated. To the last ar∣gument, taken from some sad experiences of God's people, I shall therefore add one, drawn from the religious rites of Paganism, the con∣fessions of ancient Heathens, and the testimony of modern deists.</P>
<P>When the Heathens made their temples stream with the blood of slaughtered hecatombs, did they not often explicitly deprecate the wrath of heaven and impending destruction? And was it not a sense of their guilt and danger; and an hope, that the punishment they deserved, might be transferred to their bleeding victims, which gave birth to their numerous, expiatory and pro∣pitiatory
<PB N="126" REF="017930_0123_0FA37DE17A80CA98"/>
sacrifices? If this must be granted, it is plain, those sacrifices were so many proofs, that the considerate Heathens were not utter strangers to their corruption and danger.</P>
<P>But let them speak their own sentiments. Not to mention their allegorical sables of Pro∣metheus, who brought a curse upon earth by stealing fire out of heaven; and of Pandora, whose fatal curiosity let all sorts of woes and diseases loose upon mankind: Does not Ovid in his Metamorphoses give a striking account of the fall, and its dreadful consequences? Read his description of the golden age, and you see Adam in paradise; proceed to the iron age, and you behold the horrid picture of our consum∣mate wickedness.</P>

<P>Thus the very depositions of the Heathens, in their lucid intervals, as well as their sacri∣fices, prove the depravity and danger of man∣kind. And so does likewise the testimony of some of our modern deistical philosophers.</P>
<P>The ingenious author of a book, called <HI>Phi∣losophical Enquiries concerning the Americans,</HI> in∣forms us, it is a custom among some Indians, that, as soon as the wife is delivered of a child, the husband must take to his bed, where he is waited on by the poor woman, who should have been brought there; and that, to this day, the same ridiculous custom prevails in some parts of France.
<Q>From this, and other instances, <HI>says our enquirer,</HI> we may collect, that, however men may differ in other points, there is a most striking conformity among them in <HI>ABSURDITY.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The same philosopher, who is by no means tainted with what some persons are pleased to call <HI>enthusiasm,</HI> confirms the doctrine of our na∣tural depravity by the following anecdote, and the ironical observation with which it is closed. The Eskimaux (the wildest and most sottish people in all America) call themselves <HI>men,</HI> and all other nations <HI>barbarians.</HI>
<Q>Human vanity, we see, thrives equally well in all climates; in Labrador as in Asia. Beneficent nature has dealt out as much of this comfortable quality to a Green∣lander, as to the most consummate French petit maitre.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="017930_0126_0FA37DE3C10D7090"/>The following testimony is so much the more striking, as it comes from one of the greatest poets, philosophers, and deists, of this present free-thinking age.
<Q>Who can, without horror, consider the whole earth as the empire of de∣struction! It abounds in wonders; it abounds also in victims; it is a vast field of carnage and contagion. Every species is, without pity, pursued and torn to pieces, through the earth, and air, and water. In man there is <HI>more</HI> wretchedness, than in <HI>all</HI> other animals put together: He smarts continually under two scourges, which other animals never feel; anxiety, and a listlessness in appearance, which make him weary of himself. He loves life, and yet he knows that he must die. If he enjoys some transient good, for which he is thankful to heaven, he suffers various evils, and is at last devoured by worms. This knowledge is his fatal prerogative: Other animals have it not. He feels it every moment, rankling and corroding in his breast. Yet he spends the transient moment of his ex∣istence, in diffusing the misery that he suffers; in cutting the throats of his fellow-creatures for pay; in cheating and being cheated; in robbing and being robbed; in serving that he may command; and in repenting of all that he does. The bulk of mankind are nothing more than a crowd of wretches, equally cri∣minal and unfortunate, and the globe contains rather carcasses than men. I tremble, upon a review of this dreadful picture, to find that it implies a complaint against providence, and I wish that I had never been born.</Q>
[<HI>Voltaire's Gospel of the Day.</HI>] <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Wild error is often the guide, and glaring con∣tradiction the badge, both of those, who reject re∣velation, like Voltaire; and of those, who indirectly set aside one half of it, like the Pharisees and Anti∣nomians around us. See a striking proof of it. This very author, in another book, (O! see what <HI>anti-christian</HI> morality comes to!) represents the horrible sin of Sodom as an <HI>excusable mistake of nature,</HI> and as∣sures us, that
<Q>At the worst of times, there is at most upon earth, one man in a thousand, that can be called wicked.</Q>
Now for the proof!
<Q>Hardly do we see one of those enormous crimes, that shock human nature, committed in ten years at Rome, Paris, or London, those cities where the thirst of gain, which is the pa∣rent of all crimes, is carried to the highest pitch—If men were essentially wicked, we should find every morning husbands murdered by their wives, &amp;c. as we do hens killed by foxes.</Q>
According to this apostle of the deistical world, it seems, that the most intense thirst of gold is no degree of wickedness; that a woman, to be very good, needs only not cut her husband's throat while he is asleep; and that it even little matters whether she omits the dire murder out of regard to <HI>his</HI> life, or <HI>her own.</HI> What moral philosophy is here! Why, if the sin of Sodom is a peccadillo, a frolicksome mistake; and nothing is wickedness but a treacherous cutting of an husband's or a parent's throat; I extend my charity four times beyond thee, O Voltaire, and do maintain, that there is not one wicked man in <HI>five thousand.</HI></P>
<P>I insert this note, to obviate the charge of severe critics, who accuse me of dealing in 'gross misrepre∣sentations, false quotations, and forgeries,' because I quote some authors, when they speak as the oracles of God; and do not swell my book with their in∣consistencies, when they contradict the scriptures, reason, and the truths which they themselves have advanced in some happy moments; and because I cannot force my reason to maintain with them, both sides of a glaring contradiction.</P>
<P>O ye deistical moralists, let me meet with more candor, justice, and mercy from you, than I have done from the <HI>warm</HI> opposers of the second gospel-axiom. It is enough that you discard scripture, do not, like them, make it a part of your orthodoxy, to murder reason, and kick common sense out of doors!</P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>FOURTH PART.</HEAD>
<P>THE preceding arguments recommend themselves to the common sense of think∣ing Heathens, and the conscience of reasonable deists; as being all taken from those two ama∣zing volumes, which are open to, and legible by, all; the <HI>World</HI> and <HI>Man.</HI> The following are taken from a third volume, the <HI>Bible,</HI> des∣pised by the wits of the age, merely because they study and understand it, even less than the other two. 'The Bible!' says one of them, with a smile,
<Q>save yourself the trouble of producing arguments drawn from that old legend, unless you first demonstrate its authenticity by the noble faculty, to which you appeal in these pages.</Q>
For the sake of such objectors, I here premise, by way of digression, a few rational ar∣guments to evince, as far as my contracted plan will allow, the divine authority of the scriptures.</P>
<P N="1">1. The sacred pen-men, the prophets and apostles, were holy, excellent men, and <HI>would</HI> not; artless, illiterate men, and therefore <HI>could</HI> not, lay the horrible scheme of deluding man∣kind. The hope of gain did not influence them, for they were self-denying men, that left all, to follow a Master, who <HI>had not where to lay his head</HI>; and whose grand initiating maxim was, <HI>Except a man forsake all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.</HI> They were so disinterested, that they secured nothing on earth, but hunger and
<PB N="135" REF="017930_0132_0FA37DE839FE15A8"/>
nakedness, stocks and prisons, racks and tor∣tures; which indeed was all that they could, or did expect, in consequence of Christ's express declarations. Neither was a desire of honour the motive of their actions; for their Lord himself was treated with the utmost contempt, and had more than once assured them, that they should certainly share the same fate: Besides, they were humble men, not above working as mechanics for a coarse maintenance, and so little desirous of human regard, that they exposed to the world the meanness of their birth and occupations, their great ignorance and scandalous falls.</P>
<P>Add to this, that they were so many, and lived at such distance of time and place from each other, that had they been impostors, it would have been impracticable for them to con∣trive and carry on a forgery, without being de∣tected. And as they neither would nor could <HI>deceive</HI> the world; so they neither could nor would <HI>be deceived</HI> themselves: For they were days, months, and years, <HI>eye</HI> and <HI>ear</HI> witnesses of the things which they relate; and when they had not the fullest evidence of important facts, they insisted upon new proofs, and even upon sensible demonstrations; as for instance, Tho∣mas, in the matter of our Lord's resurrection, <HI>John</HI> xx. 25. And to leave us no room to que∣stion their sincerity, most of them joyfully sealed the truth of their doctrines with their own blood. Did <HI>so many</HI> and <HI>such</HI> marks of veracity, ever meet in any other authors?</P>
<P N="2">2. But even while they lived, they confirmed their testimony by a variety of miracles, wrought in divers places, and for a number of years; sometimes before thousands of their enemies, as the miracles of Christ and his disciples; some∣times
<PB N="136" REF="017930_0133_0FA37DE9025D6C48"/>
before hundreds of thousands, as those of Moses. These miracles were so well known and attested, that when both Christ and Moses appealed to their authenticity, before their bit∣terest opposers, mentioning the persons upon whom, as well as the particular times when, and the places where, they had been performed; the facts were never denied, but passed over in silence, or maliciously attributed to the prince of the devils. By such a <HI>pitiful slander</HI> as this, Porphyry, Hierocles, Celsus, and Julian the apo∣state, those learned and inveterate enemies of Christianity, endeavoured (as the Pharisees had done before them) to sap the argument founded upon the miracles of Christ and his disciples. So sure then as God would never have displayed his arm, in the most <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Once indeed the Lord permitted the Magicians of Egypt so to use their art, as to counterfeit for a time some of Moses' miracles; but it was only to make the authenticity of others more conspicuous; this being the happy effect of the contest, when those ministers of Satan withdrew confounded, and forced to acknowledge, that the finger of God was evi∣dently displayed through the rod of their antagonist.</NOTE> astonishing manner for the support of imposture, the sacred pen men had their commission from the Almighty, and their writings are his <HI>lively oracles.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Reason itself dictates, that nothing but the plainest <HI>matter of fact,</HI> could induce so many thousands of prejudiced and persecuting Jews, to embrace the humbling, self-denying doctrine of the cross, which they so much despised and abhorred. Nothing but the clearest evidence, arising from undoubted truth, could make mul∣titudes of lawless, luxurious Heathens receive, follow, and transmit to posterity, the doctrine
<PB N="137" REF="017930_0134_0FA37DE9B9DBCC50"/>
and writings of the apostles; especially at a time when the vanity of their pretensions to miracles, and the gift of tongues, could be so easily disco∣vered, had they been impostors—at a time, when the profession of Christianity exposed persons of all ranks to the greatest contempt, and most imminent danger. In this respect the case of the primitive Christians widely differed from that of Mahomet's followers: For those who adhered to the warlike, violent impostor, saved their lives and properties, or attained to honour, by their new, easy, and flesh-pleasing religion: But those, who devoted themselves to the meek, self-denying, crucified Jesus, were frequently spoiled of their goods, and cruelly put to death; or if they escaped with their lives, were looked upon as the very dregs of mankind.</P>
<P>Add to this, that some of the most profound parts of the scriptures, were addressed to the in∣habitants of polite Greece, and triumphant Rome, among whom <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Not many noble, not many wise are called,</HI> says the apostle; nevertheless some of both, even at the rise of Christianity, openly stood up for its truth. Among the <HI>noble</HI> we find Joseph, a member of the great Jewish council; Dionysius, one of the judges at Athens; and Flavius Clemens, a Roman senator: And among the <HI>wise,</HI> Quadratus, Aristides, and Athenagoras, Athenian philosophers; Clemens, Ar∣nobius, Ammonius, Annatolius, &amp;c. men of great learning at Alexandria; and at Rome Justin martyr and Tertullian, both famous apologists for the reli∣gion of Jesus; the latter of whom, in the second century, told the Roman governors, that their cor∣porations, councils, and armies, and the emperor's palace, were full of Christians: Nor is this impro∣bable, since, so early as St. Paul's days, <HI>the saints of Caesar's houshold saluted</HI> those of the Roman pro∣vinces. Phil. iv. 22. How credulous are they who can believe that persons of such rank and learning could be deluded by Jewish fishermen into the wor∣ship of a crucified impostor!</NOTE> philosophy and literature,
<PB N="138" REF="017930_0135_0FA37DEA7B260378"/>
with the fine arts and the sciences, were in the highest perfection; and who, consequently, were less liable to be the dupes of forgery and imposture. On the contrary, gross ignorance overspread those countries where Mahomet first broach∣ed his absurd opinions, and propagated them with the sword: A sure sign this, that the sa∣cred writers did not, like that impostor, avail themselves of the ignorance, weakness, and helplessness of their followers, to impose false∣hood upon them.</P>
<P N="4">4. When the authenticity of the miracles was attested by thousands of living witnesses, religi∣ous rites were instituted, and performed by hun∣dreds of thousands, agreeable to scripture in∣junctions, in order to perpetuate that authenti∣city. And these solemn ceremonies have ever since been kept up in all parts of the world; the <HI>Passover</HI> by the Jews, in remembrance of Moses' miracles in Egypt; and the <HI>Eucharist</HI> by Christians, as a memorial of Christ's death, and the miracles that accompanied it, some of which are recorded by Phlegon the Trallian, an Hea∣then historian.</P>
<P N="5">5. The scriptures have not only the external sanction of miracles, but the internal stamp of the omniscient God, by a variety of prophecies, some of which have already been most exactly confirmed by the event predicted; witness the rise and fall of the four grand monarchies, ac∣cording to Daniel's prophecy, chap. ii. and vii. and the destruction of the city and temple of Je∣rusalem,
<PB N="139" REF="017930_0136_0FA37DEB387F64E8"/>
foretold by Christ, Matt. xxiv. 2. while others are every day fulfilled in the face of insidels, particularly the persecution of the real disciples of Christ in our own times, as well as in all ages (See Matt. x. 22, 35. John xv. 20. and Gal. iv. 29.) and the present miserable state of the Jews, so exactly described by Moses, above three thousand years ago. See Deut. xxviii. 65.</P>
<P N="6">6. Sometimes the plainest <HI>prophecies,</HI> the most public <HI>miracles,</HI> and the <HI>annals</HI> of kingdoms, well known when those books were first re∣ceived, wonderfully concur to demonstrate their authenticity. Take one instance out of many. A prophet out of Judah, above 300 years be∣fore the event, thus foretold the pollution of Jeroboam's altar at Bethel, before Jeroboam himself, who was attended by his priests, his courtiers, and, no doubt, a vast number of idolatrous worshippers: <HI>O altar, altar, thus says the Lord, Behold a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name, who shall burn mens bones upon thee:</HI> and <HI>this is the sign: Behold,</HI> this very day, <HI>the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it scattered.</HI> King Jeroboam, enflamed with anger, <HI>stretched forth his hand against the man of God, saying</HI> to his guards, <HI>Lay hold on him</HI>; but his extended hand <HI>was dried up so that he could not pull it in again to him</HI>; the rend∣ing of the altar, and scattering of the fire, in∣stantly took place; and the capital prophecy was exactly fulfilled by pious king <HI>Josiah,</HI> as you may see by comparing 1 Kings xiii. 1, &amp;c. with 2 Kings xxiii. 15, &amp;c.—Can we reasonably suppose, that books, containing accounts of such public events, would have been received as <HI>di∣vine,</HI> by a <HI>divided</HI> people, if their authenticity had not been confirmed by indubitable matter of
<PB N="140" REF="017930_0137_0FA37DEC81D48950"/>
fact? Nay, is it not as absurd to assert it, as it would be to affirm, that the offices for the 5th of November, and the 30th of January, were forged by crafty priests; and that the Papists, Puri∣tans, and Royalists of the last century, agreed to impose upon the world the history of the gun-powder plot, and of king Charles's decollation, with which those parts of our liturgy are so in∣separably connected?</P>
<P N="7">7. This scattered, despised people, the irre∣concileable enemies of the Christians, keep with amazing care <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the histories contained in the old testament were, in general, for the credit of the Jews, the <HI>love of praise</HI> might indeed have engaged some of them to join in a public forgery. But that book, of which they have always been so tenacious, presents the world chiefly with an account of their monstrous in∣gratitude, unparalleled obstinacy, perpetual rebel∣lions, abominable idolatries; and of the fearful judgments, which their wickedness brought upon them. Moses, who leads the van of their sacred au∣thors, sums up his history of the Israelites, and draws up their character in these disgraceful words, which he spake to their face: <HI>You have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you,</HI> Deut. ix. 24. And even David and Solomon, their greatest kings, are represented in those books, as guilty of the greatest enormities. O ye deists, I appeal to your reason, and ask, Would you <HI>die for,</HI> would you even <HI>connive</HI> at a notorious forgery, supposing the design of it were merely to impose upon the world as <HI>divine,</HI> a book that should perpetually stigmatize your an∣cestors, and fix horrid blots upon the names, for which you have the greatest veneration?</NOTE> the old testament, full of the prophetic history of Jesus Christ, and by that means afford the world a striking proof that the new testament is true; and Christians in
<PB N="141" REF="017930_0138_0FA37DED0107D6F8"/>
their turn show, that the old testament is abun∣dantly confirmed and explained by the new. The earl of Rochester, the great wit of the last century, was so struck with this proof, that upon reading the 53d chapter of Isaiah, with floods of penitential tears he lamented his for∣mer infidelity, and warmly embraced the faith, which he had so publicly ridiculed.</P>

To say nothing of the venerable antiquity, and wonderful preservation of those books, some of which are by far the most ancient in the world: To pass over the inimitable simplicity, or true sublimity, of their stile; they carry with them such characters of truth, as command the respect of every unprejudiced reader.</P>
<P>They open to us the mystery of the creation, the nature of God, angels, and man, the im∣mortality <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is remarkable that the wisest Heathens, with all their philosophy, seldom attained to a full as∣surance of the immortality of the soul.

a vein of ecclesiastical history and theolo∣gical truth, consistently running through a col∣lection of sixty-six different books, written by various authors, in different languages, during the space of above 1500 years—There we find, as in a deep and pure spring, all the genuine drops and streams of spiritual knowledge, which can possibly be met with in the largest libraries —There the workings of the human heart are described, in a manner that demonstrates the inspiration of the Searcher of hearts—There we have a particular account of all our spiritual maladies, with their various symptoms, and the method of a certain cure; a cure that has been witnessed by millions of martyrs and departed saints, and is now enjoyed by thousands of good men, who would account it an honour to seal the truth of the scriptures with their own blood —There you meet with the noblest strains of penitential and joyous devotion, adapted to the dispositions and states of all travellers to Sion— And there you read those awful threatnings and chearing promises, which are daily fulfilled in the consciences of men, to the admiration of believers, and the astonishment of attentive infidels.</P>
<P N="9">9. The wonderful efficacy of the scriptures is another proof that they are of God. When they are faithfully opened by his ministers, and powerfully applied by his Spirit, they <HI>wound and heal,</HI> they <HI>kill and make alive,</HI> they alarm the careless, turn or enrage the wicked, direct the lost, support the tempted, strengthen the weak, comfort mourners, and nourish pious souls. As the woman of Samaria said of Jesus, <HI>Come, see a man that told me all that ever I did: Is not this the Christ?</HI> a good man can say of the Bible,
<Q><PB N="143" REF="017930_0140_0FA37DEE418C54F0"/>Come, see a book that told me all that was in my heart, and acquainted me with the va∣rious trials and dangers I have met with in my spiritual travels; a book where I have found those truths, which, like a divinely tempered sword, have cut my way through all the snares and forces of my spiritual adversaries; and by whose directions my soul has happily entered the paradise of divine and brotherly love, Is not this the book of God?</Q></P>
<P N="10">10. To conclude: It is exceedingly remark∣able, that the more humble and holy people are, the more they read, admire, and value the scrip∣tures; and on the contrary, the more self-con∣ceited, worldly-minded, and wicked, the more they neglect, despise, and asperse them.</P>
<P>As for the objections which are raised against their perspicuity and consistency, those who are both pious and learned know, that they are ge∣nerally founded on prepossession, and the want of understanding in spiritual things; or on our ignorance of several customs, idioms, and cir∣cumstances, which were perfectly known when those books were written. Frequently also the <HI>immaterial</HI> error arises merely from a wrong punctuation, or a mistake of copiers, printers, or translators; as the daily discoveries of pious critics, and ingenuous confessions of unpreju∣diced enquirers, abundantly prove.</P>
<P>To the preceding arguments, I beg leave to add the following queries: Do not disbelievers, by supposing that the scriptures are a forged book, and consequently that Christianity is a false religion, run upon the very rocks which they seem so afraid of? And may they not be charged with indirectly setting their seal to opi∣nions,

Is not this as absurd as to believe, that thousands of wise Englishmen, and sensible Frenchmen, could be induced by the absurd tale of two or three Hottentots, to worship a certain Hotten∣tot, whom the whole nation of Hottentots had condemned to be hanged, as being more worthy of an ignominious death, than the bloody ring-leader of a seditious mob?</P>
<P N="5">5.

For Pliny, Tacitus, Lu∣cian, and Suetonius, Heathen authors, who lived soon after Christ, make express mention of him; as do also Mahomet, many of the rabbies, and Julian the emperor, that powerful and crafty apostate, who not only never denied Christ's existence, but openly acknowledged that Paul, Mark, Matthew, and Peter, were the authors of the gospels and epistles, which bear their name. Now is not this as ridiculous as to believe, that the pope, the mufty, and the in∣quisitors, have laid their heads with Messrs.

If you deny the authenticity of the four gospels, which are the only ancient histories that we have of our Saviour; and yet believe, that there was such a personage as Jesus Christ, whose fame so spread through the Roman em∣pire, that in less than 330 years he was not only reckoned superior to the Roman emperor, but to Jupiter himself; and that nevertheless not one historian, during all that time, gave the world a <HI>particular</HI> account of him: [which must be the case, if the four gospels are a forgery] Might you not as reasonably suppose, that if a blazing meteor appeared in our day, and eclipsed the stars, the moon, and the sun itself; no astronomer for several centuries would take <HI>particular</HI> notice of so wonderful a phenomenon?</P>
<P N="7">7. If the gospel is a delusion, you believe that St. Paul, who was a man of sense, learning, and intrepidity, was seduced by—no body, to preach for near thirty years, with astonishing zeal and matchless hardships, an imposture, against the abettors of which, he just before <HI>breathed</HI> nothing but <HI>threatnings and slaughter.</HI> Would it be half so absurd to believe, that Mr. Wilkes has suddenly commenced the mi∣nister's advocate, goes through the kingdom to recommend the present administration, and ac∣counts it an honour to be mobb'd, whipt, or stoned in every borough, for his excessive at∣tachment to the king?</P>
<P N="8">8. The instantaneous conversion of thousands, was wrought by means of public appeals to no∣torious matter of fact.

<HI>done in a corner,</HI> Acts xxvi. 26. Now if Chri∣stianity is not founded upon indubitable facts, might you not as well believe, that twelve men broke loose from bedlam, brought last year thousands of deists over to Christianity, by say∣ing to them, '<HI>Ye know</HI>' — what you are perfect strangers to; that is, '<HI>Ye know</HI>' that we are a pack of bedlamites?</P>
<P N="9">9. If the gospel is forged, you believe that the Corinthians, &amp;c. handed down to posterity, as a sacred treasure, epistles where St. Paul mentions their amazing conversion from gross immoralities; congratulates them about the <HI>spi∣ritual</HI> or miraculous <HI>gifts,</HI> in which they abound∣ed, 1 Cor. xii. 1. and gives them particular di∣rections, how to use the <HI>gift of tongues</HI> to edifica∣tion; when yet they were totally unacquainted with any such things.

<P N="10">10. If you say that the apostles were <HI>fools,</HI> you must believe, that <HI>foolish</HI> fishermen laid a scheme with so much <HI>wisdom,</HI> and carried it on with so much <HI>art,</HI> as to deceive multitudes of Greeks noted for their acuteness, and num∣bers of Romans famous for their prudence. Might you not as well believe that twelve poor, unarmed <HI>idiots,</HI> once combined to take the strongest towns in Europe, and accomplished

their strange design by means, that strike the profoundest politicians with astonishment?</P>
<P N="11">11. If you affirm, that the apostles were <HI>cheats</HI> and <HI>liars,</HI> you run into as great a diffi∣culty; for you must believe that the greatest <HI>knaves</HI> that ever existed, contrary to their own principles and advantage, went through the world, exposing themselves to the greatest hard∣ships and severest tortures unto death, to recom∣mend both by their <HI>example</HI> and <HI>precepts,</HI> the strictest piety towards God, and the most scru∣pulous <HI>honesty</HI> towards man; perpetually de∣nouncing eternal destruction to cheats and hy∣pocrites, and the torments of a <HI>lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, to every one who loveth or maketh a lie.</HI> Would it be more absurd to be∣lieve, that the twelve greatest epicures in Eng∣land, have for a course of years, fulfilled a mu∣tual agreement of preaching night and day, ab∣stinence and fasting through the three king∣doms, merely to have the pleasure of starving to death for their pains?</P>
<P N="12">12. To conclude: If the gospel (and conse∣quently the scripture) is an imposture, you sup∣pose, that some poor Galilean fishermen, only by means of an <HI>absurd lie,</HI> which they told with∣out wit, and wrote without elegance, foiled the multitude of the Jewish and Pagan priests, who had prejudice, custom, possession, learning, ora∣tory, wealth, laws, governors, and emperors on their side; yea, and <HI>truth</HI> also, upon your prin∣ciples, at least when they decried the gospel as a <HI>cheat.</HI> Would it be more ridiculous to believe, that David killed Goliah with a grain of sand, and cut off his head with a spire of grass; or that our sailors sink men of war with a puff of

breath, while our soldiers batter down ramparts with snow-balls?</P>
<P>O ye sons of worldly wisdom, drop your un∣just prejudices; candidly weigh both sides of the question, and you will soon see, that in reject∣ing the gospel as an imposture, you display a far greater degree of <HI>credulity,</HI> than we do in cordi∣ally receiving it.</P>
<P>After this short defence of the oracles of God, and this little attack upon the persons who sus∣pect their authenticity, I hope I may [consist∣ently with the plan of <HI>an Appeal to Reason</HI>] pro∣duce from THE SCRIPTURES, a few more argu∣ments to prove the original depravity and lost estate of mankind.</P>
<DIV3 N="31" TYPE="argument">
<HEAD>XXXI. ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The spiritual life of the soul consists in its union with God, as the natural life of the body does in its union with the soul: And as poison and the sword kill the latter, so unbelief and sin destroy the former.</P>
<P>The first man was endued with this two-fold life; <HI>God,</HI> says the divine historian, <HI>breathed into him the breath of lives, and he became a living</HI> body and a living <HI>soul:</HI> He had both an animal life in common with beasts, and a spiritual life in common with angels. St. Paul, who calls this angelical life <HI>the life of God,</HI> intimates that it consisted both <HI>in</HI> that experimental <HI>knowledge</HI> of our Creator, wherein, says our Church, 'standeth our eternal life,' and <HI>in righteousness and true holiness,</HI> the moral and most glorious image of the Supreme Being.</P>
<P>To suppose man was created void of this es∣sential <HI>knowledge</HI> and <HI>holy love,</HI> is to suppose he
<PB N="151" REF="017930_0148_0FA37DF43871A948"/>
came very wicked out of the hands of the Pa∣rent of all good: For what is a rational crea∣ture, that neither <HI>knows</HI> nor <HI>loves</HI> his Creator, but a monster of stupidity and ingratitude, a wretch actually dead to God, and deserving present destruction?</P>
<P>When the Lord therefore said to man, <HI>In the day that thou eatest thereof,</HI> that is, in the day that thou sinnest, <HI>thou shalt surely die,</HI> it was as if he had said,
<Q>In that very day, sin shall assuredly separate between thee and the God of thy life: Thou shalt certainly lose the glorious view, which thou hast of my boundless goodness and infinite perfections: Thou shalt infallibly quench the spirit of ardent love, and stop the breath of delightful praise, by which thou livest both to my glory and thy comfort: And thy soul <HI>dead in trespasses and sins,</HI> shall remain in the filthy prison of a mortal body, till death breaks it open, to remove thee to thy own place.</Q></P>
<P>And was not this Adam's case after his fall? Did he not <HI>know that he was naked,</HI> stript of the glorious image of his Creator? Did not guilty <HI>shame</HI> immediately prompt him to <HI>hide</HI> and pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ct, as well as he could, his degenerate and en∣feebled body? Devoid of the ardent love he felt for God before, and of the pure delight he en∣joyed in him, was not he left the wretched prey of tormenting <HI>fears?</HI> Did he not evidence his hatred of his heavenly Benefactor, by <HI>dreading</HI> his voice, and flying from him as hastily as he should have fled from the infernal serpent?</P>
<P>Was he not deprived of the knowledge by which, at first sight, he discovered the nature of Eve, and gave to all living creatures names ex∣pressive of their respective properties?—Was he
<PB N="152" REF="017930_0149_0FA37DF500A14910"/>
not, I say, deprived of that intuitive knowledge and excellent wisdom, when he foolishly <HI>hid himself among the trees</HI> from his <HI>all-seeing, omni∣present</HI> Creator? And is it not evident that he was lost to all sense of filial fear towards God, and conjugal love towards Eve, when, instead of self-accusations, penitential confessions, and earnest pleas for mercy, he shewed nothing at his trial but stubbornness, malice, and insolence?</P>
<P>Such was the state of corruption into which Adam had deplorably fallen, before he multi∣plied the human species. Now, according to the invariable laws of Providence, an upright, holy nature can no more proceed from a fallen, sinful one, than gentle lambs can be begotten by fierce tygers, or harmless doves by venomous serpents: Common sense, therefore, and natural philosophy, dictate, that our first parents could not communicate the angelical life which they had lost, nor impart to their children a better nature than their own; and that their depravity is as much ours by nature, as the fierceness of the first lion, is the natural property of all the lions in the world.</P>

<P>I answer, 1. <HI>God made man in his image,</HI> part of which consists in free agency, or a power to determine his own actions. And if creating a free agent is not repugnant to divine wisdom

and goodness; the wrong choice or sin of a free agent, can be no impeachment of those perfecti∣ons in the Deity. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">God answers thus for himself in MILTON,

Suppose man had not been endued with freedom of choice, he would only have ranked among admirable machines, and nothing could have been more absurd, than to place him in a state of probation. And suppose, when he was in that state, divine power had irresistibly turned the scale of his will to obedience, the <HI>trial</HI> would have been <HI>prevented,</HI> and the counsel of divine wisdom foolishly defeated.</P>
<P N="3">3. God did all that a wise and good Ruler of rational and free creatures could do, to prevent sin. He placed in Adam's heart, a vigorous principle of holiness: He granted him sufficient strength to continue in obedience: He indulged him with his blessed presence and converse, to encourage him in the way of duty: He strictly forbad him to sin: He enforced the prohibition by the fearful threatning of death: He promised to crown his continuance in holiness, with a glorious immortality; and gave him <HI>the tree of life</HI> as a pledge of this inestimable blessing. To have gone farther, would have been entirely in∣consistent with his wisdom; an absolute restraint being as contrary to the liberty of a moral agent, and the nature of the divine law, as chaining down an harmless man, that he may not commit murder, is contrary to the freedom of English∣men, and the laws of this realm. Nor can we, either with reason or decency, complain that God did not make us <HI>absolutely immutable</HI> and <HI>perfect</HI>
<PB N="155" REF="017930_0152_0FA37DF7B8DD0990"/>
like himself: This is charging him with folly, for not enduing us with infinite wisdom, and knowledge every way boundless; that is, for not making us <HI>gods</HI> instead of <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. In case man fell, divine mercy had decreed his recovery by Jesus Christ: And when the almighty Redeemer shall have brought life out of death, and light out of darkness, the mysterious drama of creation and redemption, of which we see but one or two acts, will appear, even to our objectors, every way worthy of its infinitely wise and gracious Author.</P>
<P N="2">II. In the mean time they will still urge that
<Q>Adam's posterity (then unborn) could not <HI>justly</HI> partake of the consequences of his trans∣gression.</Q>
But, shall cavils overthrow <HI>matter of fact?</HI> Do not we see in every unrenewed per∣son, the unbelief, pride, sinful curiosity, sensu∣ality, and alienation from God, to which our first parents were subjected at their fall? Do not women bear children with sorrow, as well as Eve? Is the ground less cursed for us than for Adam? And do not we toil, suffer, and die, as he did? If this order of things were <HI>unjust,</HI> would the <HI>righteous</HI> God have permitted its con∣tinuance to the present time? Besides,</P>
<P>Adam contained in himself, as in miniature, all his posterity. The various nations of men, are nothing but different branches growing from that original root. They are <HI>Adam,</HI> or <HI>Man,</HI> existing at large; as the branches of a spreading oak, with all the acorns that have grown upon, and dropped from them, during a long successi∣on of summers, are nothing but the original acorn, unfolding and multiplying itself with all its essential properties. It is then as ridiculous
<PB N="156" REF="017930_0153_0FA37DF7FB2B9D10"/>
to wonder, that the sons of depraved Adam should naturally be depraved, as that an acorn should naturally produce an oak; and a poison∣ous root, a malignant plant. Again,</P>
<P>Adam was the general head, representative, and father of mankind; and we suffer for his re∣bellion <HI>legally</HI>; as the children of those who have sold themselves for slaves, are born in a state of wretched slavery; and as the descendents of a noble traitor, lose the title by their ancestor's crime: <HI>Naturally,</HI> as the sons of a bankrupt suf∣fer poverty for their father's extravagance, or as <HI>Gehazi's leprosy clave to him and his seed for ever:</HI> And <HI>unavoidably,</HI> as an unborn child shares the fate of his unhappy mother, when she inadver∣tently poisons, or desperately stabs herself.</P>
<P N="3">III. 'But,' say the same objectors,
<Q>sup∣posing it be granted, that we are naturally depraved; yet if our depravity is <HI>natural,</HI> it is <HI>necessary</HI>; and we are no more <HI>blameable</HI> for it, than lions for their fierceness, or Ethiopians for their black complexion.</Q></P>
<P N="1">1. Our objectors would not, I presume, be understood to insinuate by 'blameable,' that our depravity does not render us detestable in the eyes of an holy God, or that it is not in itself blame-worthy. Do they less dislike the com∣plexion of the Ethiopians, or less detest the de∣structive rage of lions, because it is <HI>natural</HI> to them? If moral dispositions ceased to be worthy of praise or dispraise, as soon as they are rooted, <HI>morally necessary,</HI> and, in that sense, <HI>natural</HI>; what absurd consequences would fol∣low! Sinners would become guiltless by ar∣riving at compleat impenitency; and God could not be praised for his holiness, nor Satan dis∣praised
<PB N="157" REF="017930_0154_0FA37DF8C21F3680"/>
for his sinfulness; holiness being as es∣sential to God, by the absolute perfection of his nature, as sin is morally necessary to the devil, by the unconquerable habit which he has wil∣fully contracted, and in which he obstinately remains.</P>
<P N="2">2. Should they mean, that 'we are not <HI>ans∣werable</HI> or <HI>accountable</HI> for our depravity:' I reply, Though I should grant (which I am very far from doing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>MILTON introduces Adam speaking thus,</L>
<L>Ah why should all mankind,</L>

<P N="4">IV. However, the advocates for the natural purity of the human race (endeavouring to clog with difficulties, what they cannot disprove to be matter of fact) still assert,
<Q>As we have our souls <HI>immediately</HI> from God, <HI>if</HI> we are born sin∣ful, he must either create <HI>sinful</HI> souls, which cannot be supposed without impiety; or send <HI>sinless</HI> souls into <HI>sinful</HI> bodies, to be defiled by the unhappy union, which is as inconsistent with his goodness as his justice. Add to this, say the objectors, that nothing can be more unphilosophical than to suppose, that a body, a mere lump of organized matter, is able to communicate to a pure spirit that moral pol∣lution, of which itself is as incapable, as the murderer's sword is incapable of cruelty.</Q></P>
<P>This specious objection, which Dr. Watts acknowledges to be
<Q>the very chief point of dif∣ficulty, in all the controversies about original sin,</Q>
is wholly founded upon the vulgar no∣tion, that we have our souls immediately from God by infusion: It will therefore entirely fall to the ground, if we can prove, that we receive them, as well as our bodies, by traduction from Adam: And that this is fact, appears, if I am not mistaken, by the following arguments,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="160" REF="017930_0157_0FA37DFAFA1B2328"/>1. We have no ground, from scripture or rea∣son, to think that adulterers can, when they please, put God upon <HI>creating</HI> new souls to ani∣mate the spurious fruit of their crime. On the contrary, it is said, that <HI>God rested on the seventh day from</HI> ALL <HI>his work</HI> of creation.</P>
<P N="2">2. Eve herself was not <HI>created</HI> but <HI>in</HI> Adam: God breathed no breath of life into her, as he did into her husband, to make him <HI>a living soul.</HI> Therefore when Adam saw her, he said, <HI>She shall be called woman, because she</HI> [her whole self, not her body only] <HI>was taken out of man.</HI> If then the soul of the first woman sprang from Adam's soul, as her body from his body, what reason have we to believe, that the souls of her posterity are immediately infused, as Adam's was when God created him?</P>
<P N="3">3. All agree, that under God we receive <HI>life</HI> from our parents; and if <HI>life,</HI> then certainly our <HI>soul,</HI> which is the <HI>principle of life.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Other animals have power to propagate their own species <HI>after its kind</HI>; they can gene∣rate <HI>animated</HI> bodies: Why should man be but <HI>half</HI> a father? When did God stint him to pro∣pagate the mere <HI>shell</HI> of his person, the body without the soul? Was it when <HI>he blessed him, and said, Be fruitful and multiply?</HI> When he spoke thus, did he not address himself to the <HI>soul,</HI> as well as to the body? Can the body alone either understand or execute a command? Is it not, on the contrary, highly reasonable to conclude, that by virtue of the divine appoint∣ment and blessing, the <HI>whole</HI> man can <HI>be fruitful and multiply</HI>; and the soul, under proper cir∣cumstances, can generate a soul, as a thought begets a thought; and can kindle the flame of life, as one taper lights another; without weak∣ening
<PB N="161" REF="017930_0158_0FA37DFBB8449A20"/>
its immortal substance, any more than God the Father (if I may be allowed the com∣parison) impairs the divine essence by the <HI>eternal</HI> generation of his <HI>only begotten Son.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Does not <HI>matter of fact</HI> corroborate the preceding argument? A sprightly race-horse ge∣nerally begets a mettlesome colt; while an heavy cart-horse begets a colt, that bears the stamp of its sire's dulness. And is it not so with man∣kind in general? The children of the Hotten∣tots and Eskimaux, are commonly as <HI>stupid</HI>; while those of the English and French, are usu∣ally as <HI>sharp,</HI> as their parents. You seldom see a wit springing from two half-witted people, or a fool descended from very sensible parents. The children of men of genius, are frequently as remarkable for some branch of hereditary ge∣nius, as those of blockheads, for their native stupidity. Nothing is more common, than to see very passionate and flighty parents have very passionate and flighty children. And I have an hundred times discovered, not only the features, look, and complexion of a father or a mother in a child's face; but seen a congenial soul, look∣ing out [if I may so speak] at those windows of the body, which we call <HI>the eyes.</HI> Hence I conclude, that the advice frequently given to those, who are about to chuse a companion for life, '<HI>Take care of the breed,</HI>' is not absolutely without foundation; although some lay too much stress upon it; forgetting that a thousand unknown accidents may form exceptions to the general rule; and not considering, that the pe∣culiarity of the father's breed, may be happily corrected by that of the mother, [and vice versa] and that as the grace of God yielded to, may

<HI>sweeten</HI> the <HI>worst</HI> temper; so sin persisted in, may <HI>sour</HI> the <HI>best.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Again, Moses informs us, that fallen <HI>Adam begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image:</HI> But had he generated a body without a soul, he would not have <HI>begotten a son in his own likeness,</HI> since he was not a mere mortal body, but a <HI>fallen embodied spirit.</HI> Compare Gen. v. 3. with xlvi. 26.</P>
<P>'But upon this scheme,' will objectors say,
<Q>if Adam was converted when he begat a son, he begat a converted soul.</Q>
This does by no means follow; for if he was born of God after his fall, it was <HI>by grace through faith,</HI> and not by nature through generation: He could not there∣fore communicate his <HI>spiritual regeneration</HI> by <HI>na∣tural generation,</HI> any more than a great scholar can propagate his learning together with his species.</P>
<P>Should it be again objected, that
<Q>The soul is not generated, because the scriptures de∣clare, <HI>The Lord is the father of the spirits of all flesh,</HI> and <HI>The spirit returns to God who gave it:</HI></Q>
I answer, it is also written, that Job and David were <HI>fearfully made and fashioned by the hands of God in the womb</HI>; that he formed <HI>Jeremiah in the belly</HI>; and that <HI>we are the offspring of him, who made of one blood all nations of men.</HI> Now if the <HI>latter</HI> scriptures do not exclude the interposition of parents, in the formation of their childrens <HI>bodies</HI>; by what rule of criticism or divinity can we prove, that the <HI>former</HI> exclude that interposi∣tion in the production of their <HI>souls?</HI></P>
<P>Nor can materialists, who have no ideas of generation, but such as are gross and carnal like their own system, with any shadow of reason <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that
<Q>if the soul is generated with the
<PB N="163" REF="017930_0160_0FA37DFD3A058018"/>
body, it will also perish with it:</Q>
For disso∣lution is so far from being a necessary conse∣quence of the spiritual generation of souls, that it would not so much as have followed the ge∣neration of our bodies, if Adam had not brought <HI>sin into the world, and</HI> DEATH <HI>by sin.</HI>—Again, if wheat, a material seed, which grows out of the same earthly clod with the chaff that en∣closes it, can subsist unimpaired, when that mean cover is destroyed: how much more can the soul (that spiritual, vital, heavenly power, which is of a nature so vastly superior to the body in which it is confined) continue to exist, when flesh and blood are returned to their native dust!</P>
<P>Should some persons reject what I say of the traduction of souls, in order to illustrate the de∣rivation of original sin: and should they say, that they have no more idea of the <HI>generation,</HI> than honest Nicodemus had of the <HI>regeneration of a spirit:</HI> I beg leave to observe two things,</P>
<P>First, If such objectors are converted, they will not deny the <HI>regeneration</HI> of souls by the Spirit of God, since they experience it, and our Lord speaks of it as a blessed reality, even while he represents it as a mystery <HI>unknown</HI> as to the manner of it, John iii. 8—13. Now if pious souls have been <HI>regenerated</HI> from the beginning of the world, without exactly knowing <HI>how</HI>; is it reasonable to deny that souls are <HI>generated,</HI> merely because we cannot exactly account for the manner in which that wonder takes place?</P>
<P>Secondly, Should my objectors be versed in natural philosophy, they need not be told, that even the kind of generation, which they allow, is as much a <HI>mystery</HI> to man, as the movement of a watch is to a child, that just sees the case and the glass. If they will not believe me, let
<PB N="164" REF="017930_0161_0FA37DFDFAE13248"/>
them believe him, who <HI>gave his heart to search out by wisdom, concerning all things that are done under heaven,</HI> and who, touching upon our que∣stion, says, <HI>As thou knowest not what is the way of the Spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so, thou knowest not the works of God, who maketh all.</HI> Eccl. xi. 5.</P>
<P>For my part, I do not see, why the same al∣mighty Preserver of men, who [as St. Paul tells us] <HI>made of</HI> ONE BLOOD the bodies of <HI>all nations of men,</HI> might not <HI>of one</HI> ACTIVE THOUGHT, and ARDENT DESIRE, <HI>have made</HI> the souls of <HI>all nations of men</HI> also. Have not <HI>thought</HI> and <HI>de∣sire</HI> as great affinity to the nature of the <HI>soul,</HI> as <HI>blood</HI> has to that of the <HI>body?</HI> And consequently are not our ideas of the <HI>traduction</HI> of the <HI>soul,</HI> as clear as those, which we can form of the <HI>genera∣tion</HI> of the <HI>body?</HI></P>
<P>Having dwelt so long upon the manner in which mankind naturally propagate original corruption, together with their <HI>whole</HI> species, I hope I may reasonably resume the conclusion of my argument, and affirm, that, if Adam cor∣rupted the fountain of human nature in himself, we, the streams, cannot but be naturally cor∣rupted.</P>

<P>God being a <HI>Spirit,</HI> reason and revelation jointly inform us, that his law is <HI>spiritual,</HI> and extends to our thoughts and tempers, as well as to our words and actions.

<P><PB N="165" REF="017930_0162_0FA37DFEBA166068"/>Therefore, if we have not always trusted and delighted in God, more than in all things and persons; if for one instant we have <HI>loved,</HI> or feared <HI>the creature more than the Creator</HI>; we <HI>have</HI> had <HI>another God besides the Lord,</HI> Col. iii. 5.

<P>Did we ever shew any disrespect to our supe∣riors, or unkindness to our equals and inferiors; we have violated the precept that commands us to <HI>honour all men,</HI> and be punctual in the dis∣charge of all social and relative duties, 1 Pet. ii. 17. —Did we ever weaken our constitution by ex∣cess, strike our neighbour in anger, wound his character with an injurious word, or only suffer hatred to rise in our breast against him; we have committed a species of murder; for, <HI>Who∣soever shall say to his brother, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire</HI>; and <HI>Whosoever hateth his bro∣ther, is a murderer,</HI> Matt. v. 22. 1 John iii. 15. —Are we <HI>the friends of the world,</HI> an apostle brands us with the name of <HI>Adulterers,</HI> because

we are false to our heavenly bridegroom, Jam. iv. 4.

<P>Such being the extreme spirituality of the law, who can plead, that he never was guilty of breaking one, or even all of the ten command∣ments? And if we have broken them all, either in their literal or spiritual meaning, and are threatned for every transgression, with a curse suitable to the Lawgiver's infinite majesty, who can conceive the greatness of our guilt and dan∣ger? Till we find a sanctuary under the shadow of a Saviour's wings, are we not as liable to the strokes of divine vengeance, as a felon, guilty of breaking all the statutes of his country, is liable to the penalty of human laws?</P>
<P>If this is not the case, there is no justice in the court of heaven, and the laws given with so much terror from the Almighty's throne, like

<P>Some indeed flatter themselves, that
<Q>the law, since the gospel-dispensation, abates much of its demands of perfect love.</Q>
But their hope is equally unsupported by reason and scripture. The law is the eternal rule of right, the moral picture of the God of holiness and love. It can no more vary, than its eternal, unchangeable original. The Lord <HI>will not alter the thing that is gone out of his mouth.</HI> He must cease to be what he is, before his law can lose its power to bind either men or angels; and all creatures shall break sooner than it shall bend; for if it commands us only to <HI>love God with all our heart, and our neighbour as ourselves,</HI> what JUST abate∣ment can be made in so equitable a precept?

<P><PB N="168" REF="017930_0165_0FA37E0107839D50"/>If faith is so essential a virtue, how depraved and wretched is man, who is so excessively <HI>slow of heart, to believe</HI> the things that concern his salvation!

<P>And ye, numerous tribe of patients, how do ye shame those who call themselves Christians!

<P>One false witness is often sufficient to make us believe, that a neighbour vows to do us an injury: But twenty ministers of Jesus cannot persuade us, God <HI>hath sworn in his wrath,</HI> that if we die in our sins <HI>we shall not enter into his rest,</HI> Psal. xcv. 11. or that if we <HI>come to him</HI> for pardon and life, <HI>he will in no wise cast us out,</HI> John vi. 37.—The most defamatory and impro∣bable reports spread with uncommon swiftness, and pass for matter of fact: But when St. Paul testifies, that <HI>if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his,</HI> Rom. viii. 9. who be∣lieves his testimony?

<P>Take away then the doctrine of the fall, and the tower of evangelical truth, built by Jesus Christ, is no more founded on a rock, but upon the sand: Or rather, the stately fabric is in∣stantly thrown down, and leaves no ruins behind it, but the dry morality of Epictetus, covered with the rubbish of the vilest metaphors, and buried in the most impertinent ceremonies.</P>

<HEAD>XXXVI. ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>One more absurdity still remains. If man is not in the most imminent danger of destruction, nothing can be more extravagant than the great article of the Christian faith, thus expressed in the Nicene creed: <HI>Jesus Christ, very God of very God, by whom all things were made, for us men, and for our salvation came down from heaven, was made man, and was crucified</HI> FOR US.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="017930_0170_0FA37E04B8F3E138"/>Is it not astonishing, that there should be people so infatuated, as to join every Lord's day in this solemn confession, and to deny the other six, the horrible danger to which they are ex∣posed, till they have an interest in Christ? Is not the least grain of common sense sufficient to make an attentive person see, that if he, <HI>by whom all things were made, came from heaven for</HI> OUR <HI>salvation,</HI> if he <HI>was made man</HI> that he might suf∣fer and be <HI>crucified</HI> for US; he saw US guilty, condemned, lost, and obnoxious to the <HI>damna∣tion,</HI> which we generally deprecate in the litany? Shall we charge the Son of God, <HI>in whom are hid all the treasures of divine wisdom,</HI> with the unparalleled folly of coming from heaven to atone for <HI>innocent</HI> creatures, to reprieve persons <HI>uncondemned,</HI> to redeem a race of <HI>free men,</HI> to de∣liver from the curse a people <HI>not accursed</HI>; to hang by exquisitely dolorous wounds, made in his sacred hands and feet, on a tree more igno∣minious than the gallows, for <HI>honest men</HI> and <HI>very good sort of people</HI>; and to expire under the sense of the wrath of heaven, that he might save from hell people in <HI>no danger</HI> of going there?</P>
<P>Reader! is it possible to entertain for a mo∣ment these wild notions, without offering the utmost indignity to the Son of God, and the greatest violence to common sense? And does not reason cry, as with the sound of a thousand trumpets,
<Q>If our Creator could not save us, consistently with his glorious attributes, but by becoming incarnate, passing through the deepest scenes of humiliation and tempta∣tion, distress and want, for thirty-three years; and undergoing at last the most shameful,
<PB N="174" REF="017930_0171_0FA37E05797AD030"/>
painful, and accursed death in our place; our wickedness must be desperate, our sins exe∣crable, our guilt black as the shadow of death, and our danger dreadful as the gloom and torments of hell?</Q></P>
<P>'<HI>Shocking doctrine!</HI>' says the self-conceited moralist, as he rises from his chair, full of in∣dignation, and ready to throw aside the argu∣ments he cannot answer. Reader! if you are the man, remember that this is an appeal to <HI>reason,</HI> and not to <HI>passion,</HI> to <HI>matter of fact,</HI> and not to your vitiated taste for <HI>pleasing error.</HI> You may cry out at the sight of a shroud, a coffin, a grave, '<HI>Shocking objects!</HI>' But your loudest exclamations will not lessen the awful reality, by which many have happily been <HI>shocked</HI> into a timely consideration of, and preparation for, approaching death.</P>
<P><Q>But this doctrine, you still urge, drives people to despair.</Q>
—Yes, to a despair of being saved by their own merits and righteousness; and this is as reasonable in a sinner who comes to the Saviour, as despairing to swim across the sea, is rational in a passenger that takes ship. Our church, far from speaking against it, says, that <HI>sinners should be dismayed at God's rightful justice, and should</HI> DESPAIR <HI>indeed, as touching any hope th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> may be</HI> IN THEMSELVES. Hom. on falling from God, 2d part.</P>
<P>A just despair of ourselves, is widely differ∣ent from a despair of God's mercy, and Christ's willingness to save the chief of sinners, who flies to him for refuge. This horrible sin, this black crime of Judas, springs rather from a sullen, obstinate rejection of the remedy, than, as some vainly suppose, from a clear knowledge of the
<PB N="175" REF="017930_0172_0FA37E0639FE5040"/>
disease: And, that none may commit it, Christ's ministers take particular care not to preach the law without the gospel, and the fail without the recovery: No sooner have they opened the wound of sin, festering in the sinner's consci∣ence, than they pour in the balm of divine pro∣mises, and make gracious offers of a free pardon and full salvation, by the compassionate Re∣deemer, who came to <HI>justify the ungodly</HI> and to <HI>save the lost.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed those only who see their sin and misery, will cordially embrace the gospel; for common sense dictates, that none care for the king's mercy, but those who know they are guilty, condemned criminals. How excessively unreasonable is it then to object, that the preaching of man's corrupt and lost estate drives people to despair of divine mercy, when it is absolutely the only means of shewing them their need of it, and making them gladly accept it upon God's own terms!</P>
<P>Leaving therefore that trite objection to the unthinking vulgar, once more, judicious reader, summon all your rational powers; and, after imploring help from on high to use them aright, say, whether these last arguments do not prove, that no <HI>Christian</HI> can deny the compleat fall of mankind, without renouncing the capital doc∣trines of his own religion; overturning the very foundation of the gospel, which he pro∣fesses to receive; staining the glory of the Re∣deemer, whom he pretends to honour; and im∣piously taking from his crown, <HI>wisdom, truth,</HI> and <HI>charity,</HI> the three jewels that are its brightest ornaments.—Sum up then all that has been advanced concerning the afflictive dealings of
<PB N="176" REF="017930_0173_0FA37E06F9FF9C48"/>
God's providence with mankind, and the base conduct, or wicked temper of mankind towards God, one another, and themselves.—Declare, if all the arguments laid before you, and cleared from the thickest clouds of objections that might obscure them, do not cast more light upon the black subject of our depravity, than is sufficient to shew that it is a melancholy truth. —And finally pronounce, whether the doc∣trine of our corrupt and lost estate, stated in the words of the sacred writers, and of our pious reformers, is not <HI>rationally demonstrated,</HI> and established upon the firmest basis in the world, <HI>Matter of Fact, and</HI> the dictates of <HI>common sense.</HI></P>

<HEAD>FIFTH PART.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a doctrine has been clearly de∣monstrated, the truths that <HI>necessarily</HI> spring from it, cannot reasonably be rejected. Let then common sense decide, whether the fol∣lowing consequences do not <HI>necessarily</HI> result from the doctrine of the fall, established in the preceding parts of this treatise.</P>
<P N="1">I. INFERENCE. If we are by nature in a cor∣rupt and lost estate, the grand business of mini∣sters is to rouze our drowzy consciences, and warn us of our imminent danger: It behoves them to <HI>cry aloud and spare not, to lift up their voice like a trumpet,</HI> and <HI>shew us our transgressions and our sins.</HI> Nor are they to desist from this unpleasing part of their office, till we <HI>awake to righteousness,</HI> and <HI>lay hold on the hope set before us.</HI></P>
<P>If preachers, under pretence of peace and good-nature, let the wound fester in the consci∣ence of their hearers, to avoid the thankless of∣fice of probing it to the bottom: If, for fear of giving them pain by a timely amputation, they let them die of a mortification: Or if <HI>they heal the hurt of the daughter of God's people slightly, saying, Peace! Peace! when there is no peace</HI>; they imitate those sycophants of old, who, for fear of displeasing the rich, and offending the great, <HI>preached smooth things, and prophesied deceit.</HI></P>
<P>This cruel gentleness, this soft barbarity, is attended with the most pernicious consequences,
<PB N="178" REF="017930_0175_0FA37E0879E99F60"/>
and will deservedly meet with the most dreadful punishment. <HI>Give sinners warning from me,</HI> says the Lord to every minister: <HI>When I say to the wicked,</HI> the unconverted, <HI>Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, he shall die in his iniquity,</HI> in his unconverted state; <HI>but his blood will I require at</HI> THY <HI>hand.</HI> See Matt. xviii. 3. Ezek. iii. 18. and xiii. 10.</P>
<P N="2">II. INFER. If we are naturally depraved and condemned creatures; <HI>self-righteousness</HI> and <HI>pride</HI> are the most absurd and monstrous of all our sins. The deepest repentance and profoundest humility become us: To <HI>neglect</HI> them, is to stumble at the very threshold of true religion; and to <HI>ridicule</HI> them, is to pour contempt upon reason, revelation, and the first operations of di∣vine grace on a sinner's heart.</P>
<P N="3">III. INFER. If the corruption of mankind is universal, inveterate, and amazingly powerful, no mere creature can deliver them from it. They must remain unrestored; or they must have an almighty, omniscient, omnipresent, un∣wearied, infinitely patient Saviour; willing day and night to attend to the wants, and public or secret applications of millions of wretched souls; and able to give them immediate assistance throughout the world; in all their various trials, temptations, and conflicts, both in life and in death. Is the most exalted <HI>creature</HI> sufficient for these things?</P>
<P>When such a vast body as mankind, spread over all the earth for thousands of years, made up of numerous nations, all of which consist of multitudes of individuals, each of whom has the springs of all his faculties and powers enfeebled, disordered, or broken:—When such an immense
<PB N="179" REF="017930_0176_0FA37E093901A0C0"/>
body as this, is to be restored to the image of the infinitely holy, glorious, and blessed God; common sense dictates, that the amazing task can be performed by no other than the original Artist, the great Searcher of hearts, the omni∣potent Creator of mankind.</P>
<P>Hence it appears, that, notwithstanding the cavils of Arius, the Saviour is GOD OVER ALL <HI>blessed for ever, all things were made by him, he upholds all things by the word of his power,</HI> and every believer may adore him, and say, with the wondering apostle, when the light of faith shone into his benighted soul, <HI>My Lord and my</HI> God!</P>
<P N="4">IV. INFER. If our guilt is immense, it cannot be expiated without a sacrifice of an in∣finite dignity: Hence we discover the mistake of Heathens and carnal Jews, who trusted in the sacrifices of beasts; the error of Deists, Maho∣metans, and Socinians, who see no need of any expiatory sacrifice; and the amazing presump∣tion of too many Christians, who repose a con∣siderable part of their confidence in the proper merit of their works; instead of placing it en∣tirely in the infinitely meritorious sacrifice of the immaculate Lamb of God, humbly acknow∣ledging that all the gracious rewardableness of the best works of faith, is derived from his pre∣cious blood and <HI>original</HI> merit.</P>
<P N="5">V. INFER. If our spiritual maladies are both numerous and mortal, it is evident, we cannot <HI>recover</HI> the spiritual health that we en∣joyed in our first parents, but by the powerful help of our heavenly Physician, the second Adam. How absurd is it then to say, that we
<PB N="180" REF="017930_0177_0FA37E09F9263408"/>
are saved, or <HI>recovered,</HI> by doing good works, without the quickning grace of a Saviour!</P>
<P>A wretched beggar is lame both in his hands and feet: An officious man, instead of taking him to a person famous for his skill in relieving such objects of distress, assures him, that the only way of getting well, is to run of errands for his prince, and work for his fellow-beggars. You justly wonder at the cruelty and folly of such a director: But you have much more rea∣son to be astonished at the conduct of those mi∣serable empirics, who direct poor, blind, lame sinners, labouring under a complication of spi∣ritual disorders, and sick even unto eternal death, to save themselves merely by serving God, and doing good to their neighbours; as if they needed neither repentance towards God, nor faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, nor yet free grace to enable them to repent, believe, and serve God acceptably.</P>
<P>How much more rational is the evangelical method of salvation! <HI>We are saved,</HI> says the apostle, we are restored to <HI>saving health,</HI> and a spiritual activity to serve God and our neigh∣bour, <HI>not by works, not of ourselves</HI>; but <HI>by grace,</HI> by mere favour; <HI>through faith,</HI> through such an entire confidence in our Physician, as makes us gladly take his powerful remedies, abstain from the pleasing poison of sin, and feed on those di∣vine truths, which communicate angelical vigor and happiness to our souls. Eph. ii. 8.</P>
<P N="6">VI. INFER. If our nature is so compleatly fallen and totally helpless, that in spiritual things <HI>we are not sufficient of ourselves to think any thing</HI> truly good <HI>as of ourselves, but our suffi∣ciency is of God</HI>; it is plain, we stand in absolute
<PB N="181" REF="017930_0178_0FA37E0ABB846788"/>
need of his Spirit's assistance, to enable us to pray, repent, believe, love, and obey aright. Consequently, those who ridicule the Holy Spi∣rit, and his sacred influence, despise the great <HI>helper of our infirmities,</HI> and act a most irrational, wicked, and desperate part. Rom. viii. 26.</P>
<P N="7">VII. INFER. If by nature we are <HI>really</HI> and <HI>truly</HI> born in sin, our regeneration cannot be a mere metaphor, or a vain ceremony; our spi∣ritual birth must be <HI>real</HI> and <HI>positive.</HI> How fatal therefore is the mistake of those, who suppose that the <HI>new birth</HI> is only a figurative expression for a <HI>decent behaviour!</HI> How dreadful the error of those, who imagine that all, whose faces have been typically washed with material water in baptism, are now effectually <HI>born again of</HI> living <HI>water and the</HI> Holy <HI>Spirit!</HI> And how in∣excusable the case of the multitudes, who, in the church of England, are under this danger∣ous mistake, so prudently guarded against by our pious reformers!</P>
<P>In our catechism, they clearly distinguish be∣tween <HI>the outward visible sign or form in baptism,</HI> and <HI>the inward spiritual grace:</HI> And by defining the latter, <HI>a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness,</HI> they declare that whosoever is not <HI>dead</HI> or dying <HI>to sin</HI> and <HI>alive to righteousness,</HI> is not truly regenerate, and has nothing of bap∣tism but the <HI>outward and visible sign.</HI> In the 27th of our articles they mention, that <HI>baptism is</HI> not the new birth, but <HI>a</HI> SIGN <HI>of regeneration or new birth, whereby, as by an instrument, they who receive baptism rightly, are grafted into the church.</HI> And if our church returns thanks for the regeneration of the infants whom she has
<PB N="182" REF="017930_0179_0FA37E0B7A11A190"/>
admitted to baptism, it is chiefly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I say <HI>chiefly,</HI> because our church gives thanks also for Christ's general grace and mercy to children, declaring herself <HI>persuaded of the good-will of our heavenly Father towards this</HI> [unbaptized] <HI>infant,</HI> through Christ, who said, that <HI>of little children is the kingdom of heaven.</HI> The truth lies between the error of the <HI>Pelagians,</HI> who suppose that unbaptized infants are <HI>sinless</HI> like angels; and that of the <HI>Papists,</HI> who affirm that they are <HI>graceless</HI> as devils.</NOTE> upon a cha∣ritable supposition, that they have <HI>received it rightly,</HI> and will, <HI>for their part, faithfully perform the promises made for them by their sureties.</HI> If they refuse to do it <HI>when they come of age,</HI> far from treating them as her regenerate children, she denounces a general excommunication against them, and charges them <HI>not to come to</HI> her <HI>holy table, lest Satan brings them, as</HI> he did <HI>Judas, to destruction both of body and soul.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. INFER. If the fall of mankind in Adam, does not consist in a capricious imputa∣tion of his personal guilt, but in a real, present participation of his depravity, impotence, and misery; the salvation that believers have in Christ, is not a capricious imputation of his personal righteousness; but a real, present par∣ticipation of his purity, power, and blessedness, together with pardon and acceptance.</P>
<P>Unspeakably dangerous then is the delusion of those, whose brains and mouths are filled with the notions and expressions of <HI>imputed righteousness</HI>; while their poor, carnal, unrege∣nerate hearts remain perfect strangers to <HI>the Lord our righteousness.</HI></P>
<P N="9"><PB N="183" REF="017930_0180_0FA37E0C4120B628"/>IX. INFER. If the corrupt nature which sinners derive from Adam, spontaneously pro∣duces all the wickedness that overspreads the earth; the holy nature which believers receive from Christ, is also spontaneously productive of all the fruits of righteousness, described in the oracles of God: <HI>Good works springing out</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is to be understood of a moral, and not of an absolute, irresistible necessity; for faith never un∣mans the believer.</NOTE> NE∣CESSARILY <HI>of a true and lively faith,</HI> Art. xii.</P>
<P>Such ministers therefore, as clearly preach our fall in Adam, and that faith in Christ which is productive of genuine holiness and active love, will infallibly promote good works and pure morality: When those who insist <HI>only</HI> upon works and moral duties, will neither be zealous of good works themselves, nor instrumental in turning sinners from their gross immoralities. The reason is obvious: Evangelical preachers follow their Lord's wise directions: <HI>Make the tree good, and the fruit shall be good also</HI>; but mo∣ralists will have <HI>corrupt trees bring forth good fruit,</HI> which in the nature of things is impos∣sible, Matt. xii. 33. Luke vi. 43. Therefore, as nothing but faith <HI>makes the tree good,</HI> and as <HI>without faith it is impossible to please God</HI>; the Christian, that will <HI>come to him</HI> with good works, <HI>must</HI> not only <HI>believe</HI> [as Heathens] <HI>that he is, and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him</HI>; but also that <HI>he was in Christ, recon∣ciling the world unto himself,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="10">X. INFER. If corruption and sin work so powerfully and sensibly, in the hearts of the un∣regenerate, we may, without deserving the name of Enthusiasts, affirm, that the regenerate are
<PB N="184" REF="017930_0181_0FA37E0CF9E44060"/>
sensible of the powerful effects of divine grace in their souls; or, to use the words of our 17th article, we may say, <HI>They feel in themselves the workings of the Spirit of Christ:</HI> For <HI>where</HI> the poison of <HI>sin hath abounded,</HI> and has been of course abundantly felt; <HI>grace,</HI> the powerful an∣tidote that expels it, does <HI>much more abound,</HI> and consequently may be much more perceived.</P>
<P>Therefore <HI>the knowledge of salvation by the for∣giveness of sins,</HI> the assurance of faith, and <HI>the peace of God passing all understanding,</HI> are the EX∣PERIENCED <HI>blessings</HI> of the converted; as cer∣tainly as a guilty conscience, the gnawing of worldly cares, the working of evil tempers, the tumults of unbridled appetites, and the uproars of rebellious passions, are the EXPERIENCED <HI>curses</HI> of the unconverted.</P>
<P>Reader! If these inferences are justly drawn, is it not evident, that the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those doctrines, pointed out in the ten above∣mentioned inferences, are—1. The alarming severity of the law. 2. The need of a deep, heart-felt re∣pentance. 3. The divinity of Christ. 4. The infi∣nite merit of his sacrifice. 5. Salvation by faith in him. 6. The influences of his Holy Spirit. 7. The reality of the new birth. 8. The necessity of a pre∣sent salvation. 9. The zeal of believers for good works, and 10. The comfortable assurance which they have of their regeneration.</NOTE> principles generally exploded among us, as enthusiastical or method∣istical, flow from the doctrine demonstrated in this treatise, as naturally as light from the sun? These consequences lead you perhaps farther than you could wish; but let them not make you either afraid or ashamed of the gospel. Pre∣judices, like clouds, will vanish away; but truth, which they obscure for a time, like the sun,
<PB N="185" REF="017930_0182_0FA37E0DBAE4ACE8"/>
will shine for ever. A great man in the law said, <HI>Fiat Justitia, ruat mundus.</HI> Improve the noble sentiment, and say with equal fortitude, <HI>Stet Veritas, ruat mundus:</HI> Let truth stand, tho' the universe should sink into ruins.</P>
<P>But happily for us, the danger is all on the side of the opposite doctrine; and that you may be convinced of it, I present you next with a view of the
<Q><HI>DREADFUL CONSEQUENCES</HI> necessarily resulting from the ignorance of our depravity and danger.</Q></P>
<P N="1">1. As the tempter caused the fall of our first parents, by inducing them to believe, that they <HI>should not surely die,</HI> if they broke the divine law: So, now we are fallen, he prevents our recovery by suggesting, 'the bitterness of death is past,' and 'we are in a state of safety.'—Hence it is, that you sleep on in carnal security, O ye de∣luded sons of men, and even dream, ye are safe and righteous. Nor can ye escape for your lives, till the veil of unbelief is taken away, and ye awake to a sight of your corrupt and lost estate: For there is no guarding against, nor flying from, an unseen, unsuspected evil: Here, as in a conspiracy, the danger continually in∣creases, till it is happily discovered.</P>
<P N="2">2. If we are not sensible of our natural cor∣ruption, and the justice of the curse intailed upon us on that account; can we help thinking God a tyrant, when he threatens unconverted moralists with the severest of his judgments, or
<PB N="186" REF="017930_0183_0FA37E0E80561AF8"/>
cause the black storms of his providence to overtake us and our dearest relatives?</P>
<P>Answer, ye self-righteous Pharisees, that so bitterly exclaim against the ministers, who de∣clare by the authority of scripture, that, <HI>except ye repent, ye shall all perish.</HI> Answer, fond mo∣ther, whose tears of distraction mix with the cold sweat of the convulsed, dying infant on thy lap. Dost thou not secretly impeach divine justice, and accuse heaven of barbarity? Ah! if thou didst but know the evil nature, which thou and thy Isaac have brought into the world; if thou saw'st the root of bitterness, which the hand of a gracious providence even now ex∣tracts from his heart; far from being ready to <HI>curse God, and die</HI> with thy child, thou wouldst patiently acquiesce in the kindly severe dispen∣sation: Thou wouldst <HI>clear him when he is judged</HI> by such as thyself, and even <HI>glorify him in the evil day of</HI> this painful <HI>visitation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Though man's heart is hardened as steel, it does not frequently emit the hellish sparks of such murmurings against God, because it can seldom be struck by the flint of such severe af∣flictions; yet the mischief is there, and will break out, if not by <HI>blasphemous despair,</HI> at least its contrary, <HI>presumptuous madness.</HI> Yes, reader, unless thou art happily made acquainted with the strength of thy inbred depravity, thou wilt rashly venture among the sparks of temptation: With carnal confidence thou wilt ask,
<Q>What harm can they do me?</Q>
And thou wilt con∣tinue the hazardous sport, till sin and wrath consume thee together. Nor will this be more surprizing, than that one, who carries a bag of gun-powder, and knows not the dangerous na∣ture of his load, should fearlessly rush through
<PB N="187" REF="017930_0184_0FA37E0F40122C58"/>
the midst of flames or sparks, till he is blown up and destroyed.</P>
<P N="4">4. This fatal rashness is generally accompa∣nied with a glaring inconsistency. Do not you make the assertion good, ye saints of the present age, who pretend to have found the secret of loving both God and the world? Do not we hear you deny to men, that you are <HI>condemned</HI>; and yet cry to God to <HI>have mercy upon you?</HI> But if you are not condemned, what need have you of <HI>mercy?</HI> And if you are, why do you deny your lost estate? Thou too, reader, wilt fall in∣to this absurdity, unless thou knowest thy just condemnation. But the mischief will not stop here; for,</P>
<P N="5">5. Ignorance of the mystery of iniquity with∣in you, must, in the nature of the things, cause you to neglect prayer, or to pray out of charac∣ter. As unhumbled moralists, instead of ap∣proaching the throne of grace, with the self-abasement of the penitent Publican, saying, <HI>God be merciful unto me a sinner:</HI> you will provoke the Most High, by the open profaneness of the Sadducee; or insult him by the self-conceited services of the Pharisee, boasting ye
<Q>do no harm,</Q>
and <HI>thanking God,</HI> ye <HI>are not as other men.</HI> On these rocks your formal devotion will split, till you know, that, as the impenitent and prayerless shall perish, so the Lord accepts no penitential prayer, but that of <HI>the man, who knows the plague of his own heart</HI>; because he alone prays in his own character, and without hypocrisy, 1 Pet. v. 5. 1 Kings viii. 38.</P>
<P N="6">6. And as you cannot approach the throne of grace aright, while you remain insensible of your corruption; so the reading or preaching of God's word, till it answers the end of convic∣tion,
<PB N="188" REF="017930_0185_0FA37E0FF93B0428"/>
is of no service to you, but rather proves, to use St. Paul's nervous expression, the <HI>savour of death unto death.</HI> For when the terrors of the law only suit your case, you vainly catch at the comforts of the gospel; or rather, you remain as unaffected under the threatnings of the one, as under the promises of the other: You look on mount Sinai and mount Sion with equal in∣difference, and the warmth of the preacher, who invites you to <HI>fly from the wrath to come,</HI> appears to you an instance of religious madness. Nor is it a wonder it should, while you conti∣nue unacquainted with your danger: When a mortal disease is neither felt nor suspected, a pathetic address upon its consequences and cure, must be received by any reasonable man, with the greatest unconcern; and the person that makes it in earnest, must appear exceed∣ingly ridiculous. Again,</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge,</HI> says the Lord. This is true, particularly with re∣gard to the knowledge of our depravity. Reader! if thou remainest a stranger to it, thou wilt look upon slight confessions of outward sins, as true repentance; and the <HI>godly sorrow that work∣eth repentance to salvation,</HI> will appear to thee a symptom of melancholy. Taking an external reformation of manners, or a change of ceremo∣nies and opinions, for true conversion, thou wilt think thyself in a safe state, while thy heart continues habitually wandering from God, and under the dominion of a worldly spirit. In a word, some of the branches of the tree of cor∣ruption thou mayst possibly lop off, but the root will still remain and gather strength. For it is plain, that a bad root, supposed not to exist,
<PB N="189" REF="017930_0186_0FA37E1135B84DD8"/>
can neither be heartily lamented, nor earnestly struck at with the ax of self-denial.</P>
<P>Even an Heathen could say, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Initium est salutis notitia peccati, nam qui pec∣care se nescit corrigi non vult: Deprehendas te op∣portet antequam emendes. Sen. Ep. xxviii.—Et hoc ipsum argumentum est in melius translati animi, quod vitia sua, quae adhuc ignorabat, videt. Ep. vi.</NOTE>
<Q>The know∣ledge of sin, is the first step towards salvation from it: For he, who knows not that he sins, will not submit to be set right: Thou must find out what thou art, before thou canst mend thyself.—Therefore when thou discoverest thy vices, to which thou wast before a stranger, it is a sign that thy soul is in a better state.</Q></P>
<P N="8">8. It is owing to the want of this discovery, O ye pretended sons of reason, that thinking yourselves born pure, or supposing the disease of your nature to be inconsiderable, you imagine it possible to be your own physicians, when you are only your own destroyers. Hence it is, that while you give to Jesus the titular honour of <HI>Saviour,</HI> you speak perpetually of being
<Q>saved merely by your duties and best endeavours.</Q>
Hear him warning you against this common delusion: <HI>O Israel,</HI> says he, <HI>thou hast destroyed thyself, but in</HI> ME <HI>is thy help found. The whole need not a physician, but they that are sick,</HI> beyond all hopes of recovering themselves.</P>
<P N="9">9. The prescriptions of this wise Physician, are excessively severe to flesh and blood, and some of his remedies as violent as our disease. Therefore, except we see the greatness of our danger, we shall beg to be excused from taking the bitter potion. Who can have resolution enough to <HI>cut off a right hand, to pluck out a right eye, to take up his cross daily, to deny himself, and
<PB N="190" REF="017930_0187_0FA37E1179A70880"/>
lose even his own life,</HI> or what is often dearer, his fair reputation?—Who, I say, can do this, till a sight of imminent ruin on the one hand, and of redeeming love on the other, makes him submit to the painful injunctions? Thou lovely youth, noted in the gospel for thy harmlessness, I appeal to thy wretched experience. When the Physician of souls, at whose feet thou wast prostrate, commanded thee to <HI>sell all and follow him,</HI> what made thee <HI>go away sorrowful</HI> and un∣done? Not barely thy <HI>great possessions,</HI> but the ignorance of thy condition: For <HI>all that a man hath will he give for his life,</HI> when he sees it in immediate danger, Matt. xix. 22.</P>
<P N="10">10. If it is a desperate step to turn away from the Prince of life, it is a daring one to approach him with a mere compliment. Of this never∣theless you are guilty, ye unawakened sinners, who daily appear before the throne of grace, with <HI>thanks</HI> and <HI>praises</HI> to God, <HI>for his inestimable love in the redemption of the world by our Lord Je∣sus Christ.</HI> Alas! When you deny the state of sin and misery, in which you are by nature, and yet presume to thank God for <HI>redemption</HI> from it, do not you mock him as solemnly as you would the king, were you to present him every day an address of thanks, for redeeming you from Turkish slavery, when you never knew yourselves slaves in Turky? O how provoking to God must these unmeaning thanksgivings be! Surely one day they will be ranked among the indignities, offered by earthly worms to <HI>the Majesty on High.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Some indeed, more consistent than you, openly throw off the mask. Seeing neither the unfathomable depth of their misery by the fall, nor the immense height of their aggravated ini∣quities,
<PB N="191" REF="017930_0188_0FA37E1241F66548"/>
they do not trifle with, but at once <HI>deny, the Lord that bought them.</HI> Yes, far from admiring the established method of a salvation, procured at so immense a price, as the incarna∣tion and crucifixion of the Son of God, they are not afraid to intimate it is irrational: And upon their principles they may well do it; for if our ruin is not immense, what need is there for an immensely glorious Redeemer? And if our guilt reaches not up to heaven, why should the Son of God have come down from thence, to <HI>put away sin by the sacrifice of himself?</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. As we slight or reject the Saviour, till we are truly convinced of the evil and danger of sin; so we worship a false god, a mere idol. For, instead of adoring Jehovah, infinite in his holiness and hatred of sin, inviolable in the truth of his threatnings against it, and impartial in his strict justice—a God in whose presence unhum∣bled sinners <HI>are not able to stand,</HI> and <HI>with whom evil cannot dwell</HI>; we bow to a <HI>strange god,</HI> whom pious men never knew—a god formed by our own fancy, so <HI>unholy</HI> as to connive at sin, so <HI>unjust</HI> as to set aside his most righteous law, and so <HI>false</HI> as to break his solemn word, that we must <HI>turn or die,</HI> Ezek. xxxiii. 11. Is not this worshipping a god of our own making; or as David describes him, a <HI>god altogether such as ourselves?</HI> To adore an idol of paste, made by the baker and the priest, may be indeed more foolish, but cannot be more wicked, than to adore one made by our wild imagination, and impious unbelief.</P>
<P N="13">13. We may go one step farther still, and affirm, that till we are deeply convinced of sin, far from worshipping the true God, [which im∣plies knowing, loving, and admiring him in all
<PB N="192" REF="017930_0189_0FA37E1300B847C8"/>
his perfections] we hate and oppose him in his infinite <HI>holiness</HI> and <HI>justice.</HI> The proof is obvi∣ous: Two things diametrically opposite in their nature, can never be approved of at once. If we do not side with divine holiness and justice, abhor our corruption, and condemn ourselves as hell-deserving sinners; far from approving, we shall rise against the holy and righteous God, who sentences us to eternal death for our sin: We shall at least wish he were less pure and just than he is; which amounts to wishing him to be no God. While proud fiends betray this horrid disposition, by loud blasphemies in hell; ye do it, O ye unconvinced sons of men, by your aversion to godliness upon earth. <HI>Haters of God,</HI> is then the proper name, and <HI>enmity against him,</HI> the settled temper of all unhumbled, unconverted sinners, Rom. i. 30. and viii. 7.</P>
<P N="14">14. When the nature of God is mistaken, what wonder if his law is misapprehended? <HI>The law is good,</HI> says St. Paul, <HI>if a man use it lawfully</HI>; but if we make an improper use of it, the consequence is fatal. Since the fall, the law of God, as contradistinguished from the gospel of Christ, points out to us the spotless holiness, and inflexible justice, of its divine Au∣thor. It teaches us with what ardor and con∣stancy we should love both our Creator and our fellow-creatures. As a bank cast against the stream of our iniquity, it accidentally serves to make it rise the higher, and to discover its im∣petuosity; for <HI>by the law is the knowledge of sin.</HI> It demonstrates man's weakness, who <HI>consents in∣deed to the law that it is good, but finds not how to fulfil it,</HI> Rom. vii. 16, 19. As a battery erected against our pride, when it has its due effect, it silences all our self-righteous pleas, and con∣vinces
<PB N="193" REF="017930_0190_0FA37E13B8A265D8"/>
us that a returning sinner <HI>is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Christ:</HI> a broken law, a <HI>law</HI> which <HI>worketh wrath,</HI> being absolutely unable to absolve its violator. — In a word, <HI>it is our school-master to bring us to Christ,</HI> and drives us with the rod of threatned punish∣ments, to make us touch the sceptre of mercy, held out to us from the throne of grace.</P>
<P>But, while we remain strangers to our help∣less and hopeless state by nature, far from making this proper use of the law, we trust in it, and fancy that the merit of our unsprinkled obe∣dience to it, is the way of salvation. Thus we <HI>go about to establish our own righteousness, making light of</HI> the atoning blood, which marks <HI>the new and living way</HI> to heaven. This very mistake ruined the Pharisees of old, and destroys their numerous followers in all ages, Rom. ix. 31.</P>
<P N="15">15. And when we form such wrong appre∣hensions of the <HI>law,</HI> is it possible that we should have right views of the <HI>gospel,</HI> and receive it with cordial affection? Reason and experience answer in the negative. What says the gospel to sinners? <HI>You are saved</HI> BY GRACE, through mere favour and mercy, <HI>not</HI> by the covenant <HI>of works, lest any man should boast</HI> like the Pharisee, Eph. ii. 8. Now, ye decent formalists, ye fond admirers of your own virtue, are you not utterly disqualified to seek and accept a pardon in a go∣spel way? For your seeking it upon the footing of mere <HI>mercy,</HI> implies an acknowledgment, that you deserve the ruin threatned against sinners. And suppose a pardon were granted you, before you had a consciousness of your sad deserts, you could not receive it as an act of <HI>mere grace,</HI> but only as a reward justly bestowed upon you for the merit of your works. It is plain then, that
<PB N="194" REF="017930_0191_0FA37E1479570420"/>
according to the gospel plan, none can be fit subjects of salvation, but those who are truly sensible of their condemnation.</P>
<P N="16">16. But as the grace of God in Christ, is the original and properly meritorious cause of our salvation: So the grand instrumental cause of it is <HI>faith</HI> on our part. <HI>Through faith are ye saved,</HI> says St. Paul. Now if to have faith in Christ, is habitually to lift up our hearts to him, with an humble and yet chearful confidence, seeking in him all our <HI>wisdom, righteousness,</HI> and <HI>strength,</HI> as being our instructing <HI>Prophet,</HI> atoning <HI>Priest,</HI> and protecting <HI>King</HI>; it is evident, that till we awake to a sight of our fallen state, we cannot believe, nor consequently be saved. O ye that never were sensible of your spiritual blindness, can you with sincerity take Jesus for your guide, and desire his <HI>Spirit to lead you into all truth?</HI> Does not David's prayer. <HI>Open thou mine eyes, that I may see the wonderful things of thy law,</HI> appear to you needless, if not fanatical? And is not the Redeemer's <HI>prophetic office</HI> thrown away upon such sons of wisdom as you are?</P>
<P>Have you a greater value for Jesus than they, O ye <HI>just men,</HI> who have <HI>no</HI> sensible <HI>need</HI> of heart-felt <HI>repentance,</HI> and whose breasts were ne∣ver dilated by one sigh, under a due sense of your guilt and condemnation? Can you, with∣out hypocrisy, apply to him as the <HI>High Priest</HI> of the <HI>guilty,</HI> claim him as the <HI>Advocate</HI> of the <HI>condemned,</HI> or fly to him as the <HI>Saviour</HI> of the <HI>lost?</HI> Impossible! Ye fondly hope, ye never were lost, ye were always
<Q>good livers, good believers, good churchmen;</Q>
ye
<Q>need not make so much ado</Q>
about an interest in the blood of the new covenant.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="017930_0192_0FA37E15382221E8"/>And ye, who flushed with the conceit of your native strength, wonder at the weakness of those, that continually bow to the sceptre of Jesus's grace for protection and power; can you with∣out a smile of pity hear him say, <HI>Without me ye can do nothing?</HI> Is it possible that you should sincerely implore the exertion of his royal power, for victory over sins, which you suppose your∣selves able to conquer; and for the restoration of a nature, with the goodness of which you are already so well satisfied? Your reason loudly answers, No: Therefore, till you see yourselves corrupt, impotent creatures, you will openly neglect the Redeemer, give to your aggravated sins the name of 'human frailties,' and trust to your baffled, and yet boasted endeavours. Self-deception! art thou not of all impostors the most common and dangerous, because the least suspected?</P>
<P>To sum up and close these important remarks: Look at those who, in mystic Babylon, are not truly sensible of their total fall from God, and you will see them setting their own reason above the holy scriptures; and their works in compe∣tition with the infinitely meritorious sacrifice of Christ. Inquire into their principles, and you will discover, that they either openly explode as enthusiastical, or slightly receive as unnecessary, the doctrines of salvation by faith in Christ, and regeneration by the Spirit of God. Examine their conduct, and you will find they all <HI>commit sin,</HI> and <HI>receive the mark of the beast</HI> secretly <HI>in their right hand, or</HI> openly <HI>in their foreheads,</HI> Rev. xiii. 16. Sort them, and you will have two bands, the one of Sceptics and the other of Formalists, who, though <HI>at</HI> as great <HI>enmity be∣tween themselves</HI> as <HI>Pilate and Herod, are</HI> like
<PB N="196" REF="017930_0193_0FA37E15F91962C8"/>
them <HI>made friends together,</HI> by jointly <HI>deriding</HI> and <HI>condemning</HI> JESUS in his living members.</P>
<P>And if with the candle of the Lord you search the Jerusalem of professing Christians, you will perceive that the want of an heart-felt, hum∣bling knowledge of their natural depravity, gives birth to the double-mindedness of hypocrites, and the miscarriages or apostacy of those, who once distinguished themselves in the evangelical race: You will easily trace back to the same corrupt source, the seemingly opposite errors of the <HI>loose Antinomian,</HI> and the <HI>pharisaic Legalist,</HI> those spiritual thieves, by whom the sincere Christian is perpetually reviled: And in short, you will be convinced, that if you set your eyes upon a man, who is not yet deeply conscious of his corrupt and lost estate, or whose conscious∣ness of it has worn away, you behold either a trifler in religion, a dead-hearted Pharisee, a sly hypocrite, a loose Antinomian, a self-con∣ceited formalist, a scoffing infidel, or a wretched apostate.</P>
<P>You see, reader, what a train of fatal conse∣quences results from rejecting, or not properly receiving, the doctrine demonstrated in these sheets: And now, that you may cordially em∣brace it, permit me to enumerate the
<Q><HI>UNSPEAKABLE ADVANTAGES</HI> springing from an acting knowledge of our fallen and lost estate.</Q></P>
<P>No sooner is the disease rightly known, than the neglected Jesus, who is both our gracious Physician and powerful remedy, is properly va∣lued,
<PB N="197" REF="017930_0194_0FA37E16B9BA07C8"/>
and ardently sought: <HI>All that</HI> thus <HI>seek, find</HI>; and all that find <HI>him,</HI> find saving health, eternal life, and heaven.</P>
<P>Bear your testimony with me, ye children of Abraham and of God, who <HI>see the</HI> brightness of a gospel <HI>day and rejoice.</HI> Say, What made you first wishfully <HI>look to the hills, whence your salva∣tion</HI> is <HI>come,</HI> and fervently desire to behold the sin-dispelling beams of the <HI>Sun of Righteousness?</HI> Was it not the deep, dismal night of our fallen nature, which you happily discovered, when awaking from the sleep of sin, you first saw the delusive dreams of life, as they appear to the dying? What was <HI>the Desire of nations</HI> to you, till you felt yourselves lost sinners? Alas! No∣thing: Perhaps less than nothing; an object of disgust or scorn. When <HI>the Pearl of great Price</HI> was presented to you, did you regard it more, than the vilest of brutes, an oriental pearl? And, as if it had not been enough to look at it with disdain, were not some of you ready to <HI>turn again,</HI> and <HI>rend,</HI> after the example of snarl∣ing animals, those who affectionately made you the invaluable offer? Matt. vii. 6.</P>
<P>But when the storm that shook mount Sinai, overtook your careless souls, and ye saw your∣selves sinking into an abyss of misery; did ye not cry out, and say, as the alarmed disciples, with an unknown energy of desire, <HI>Save, Lord, or we perish?</HI> And when, conscious of your lost estate, ye began to believe, that he <HI>came to seek and to save that which was lost</HI>; how dear, how <HI>precious</HI> was he to you in all his of∣fices? How glad were ye to take guilty, weep∣ing Magdalen's place, and wait for a pardon at your <HI>High Priest's</HI> feet? How importunate in saying to your <HI>King,</HI> as the helpless widow,
<PB N="198" REF="017930_0195_0FA37E1781045488"/>
<HI>Lord, avenge me of mine adversary,</HI> my <HI>evil heart of unbelief!</HI> How earnest, how unwearied in your applications to your <HI>Prophet,</HI> for heavenly light and wisdom! The incessant prayer of blind Bartimeus was then yours, and so was the gracious answer which the Lord returned to him: You <HI>received</HI> your spiritual <HI>sight.</HI> And Oh! what saw you then? The sacred <HI>Book un∣sealed! Your sins blotted out as a cloud! The glory of God shining in the face of Jesus Christ</HI>; and 'the kingdom of heaven opened to all believers!'</P>
<P>Then, and not till then, you could say from the heart, <HI>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief,</HI> 1 Tim. i. 15. Then you could cry out with his first disciples, <HI>Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God!</HI> 1 John iii. 1. <HI>We are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, whom having not seen we love; in whom, though now we see him not, yet believing, we rejoice with joy un∣speakable and full of glory, receiving the end of our faith, the salvation of our souls,</HI> Gal. iii. 26. 1 Pet. i. 8. <HI>We trusted in him, and are helped: Therefore our heart danceth for joy, and in our song will we praise him,</HI> Psal. xxviii. 8. <HI>To Him that hath loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to Him be glory and dominion for ever and ever,</HI> Rev. i. 5.</P>
<P>And this will also be your triumphant song, attentive reader, if, deeply conscious of your lost estate, you spread your guilt and misery before him, who <HI>came to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; and to comfort
<PB N="199" REF="017930_0196_0FA37E1839EF40C8"/>
all that mourn, by giving them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness,</HI> Isa. lxi. 1. <HI>Your sor∣row, it is true, may endure for a night, but joy will come in the morning, the joy of God's salvation,</HI> and the pardon of your sins. <HI>Having much for∣given you,</HI> you <HI>will</HI> then <HI>love much,</HI> and admire in proportion the riches of divine wisdom, good∣ness, justice, and power, that so graciously con∣trived, and so wonderfully executed the plan of your redemption. You will be ravished in ex∣periencing, that a condemned sinner can, not only escape impending ruin, but enter into pre∣sent possession of a spiritual paradise, where peace and joy blossom together, and whence welcome death will, ere long, translate your tri∣umphant soul to those unseen, unheard-of, in∣conceivable glories, <HI>which God hath prepared for them that love him,</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 9.</P>
<P>Nor will the blossoms of heavenly <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>joy</HI> only diffuse their divine fragrency in your soul; all <HI>the fruits of holiness</HI> will grow together with them, <HI>to the glory of God,</HI> and the profit of mankind. And thou wilt not be the last, thou fair, thou blushing <HI>Humility,</HI> to bend all the spreading branches of <HI>the tree of righteousness.</HI> No, we cannot be vain, or despisers of others, when we see that we are all corrupted, dying shoots of the same corrupted, dead stock: We cannot be self-righteous, when we are per∣suaded, that the best fruit which we can <HI>na∣turally</HI> produce, is only splendid sin, or vice co∣loured over with the specious appearance of vir∣tue: We must lie prostrate in the dust, when we consider the ignominious cross, where our divine Surety hung, bled, and died, to ransom our guilty souls.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="017930_0197_0FA37D9687E9AA50"/>A genuine conviction of our corruption and demerit thus striking at the very root of our pride, necessarily fills our hearts with inex∣pressible gratitude for every favour we receive, gives an exquisite relish to the least blessing we enjoy, and teaches us to say with the thankful patriarch, <HI>I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies:</HI> And as it renders us grateful to God, and all our benefactors, so it makes us patient under the greatest injuries, resigned in the hea∣viest trials, glad to be reproved, willing to for∣give the faults of others, open to acknowledge our own, disposed to sympathize with the guilty, tender-hearted towards the miserable, incapable of being offended at any one, and ready to do every office of kindness, even to the meanest of mankind.</P>
<P>Again, no sooner are we properly acquainted with our helplessness, than we give over leaning on an arm of flesh, and the broken reed of our own resolutions. Reposing our entire confi∣dence in the living God, we fervently implore his continual assistance, carefully avoid tempta∣tions, gladly acknowledge, that <HI>the help which is done upon the earth, the Lord doth it himself,</HI> and humbly give him the glory of all the good that appears in ourselves and others.</P>
<P>Once more, as soon as we can discover our spiritual blindness, we mistrust our own judge∣ment, feel the need of instruction, modestly re∣pair to the experienced for advice, carefully search the scriptures, readily follow their blessed directions, and fervently pray, that no false light may mislead us out of the way of salvation.</P>
<P>To conclude: A right knowledge, that <HI>the crown is fallen from our head,</HI> will make us abo∣minate sin, the cause of our ruin, and raise in
<PB N="201" REF="017930_0198_0FA37D9842FD1360"/>
us a noble ambition of regaining our original state of blissful and glorious righteousness. It will set us upon an earnest enquiry into, and a proper use of, all the means conducive to our recovery. Even the <HI>sense of</HI> our guilt will prove useful, by helping to break our obdurate hearts, by imbittering the baits of worldly vanities, and filling our souls with penitential sorrow. <HI>Be∣fore honour is humility.</HI> This happy humiliation makes way for the greatest exaltation: For <HI>thus saith the high and lofty One, that inhabitation eter∣nity, I dwell in the high and holy lace, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and the heart of the con∣trite,</HI> to <HI>fill the hungry with good things,</HI> and <HI>beautify the meek with salvation,</HI> Isaiah lvii. 15.</P>
<P>If these advantages, which exceed the worth of earthly crowns, necessarily result from the proper knowledge of our corrupt and lost estate, who but an infatuated enemy of his own soul, would be afraid of that self-science? Who, but an obstinate Pharisee, would not esteem it, next to the knowledge of Christ, the greatest blessing which heaven can bestow upon the self-destroyed, and yet self-conceited children of men?</P>
<P>Careless reader! if thou art the person, if, re∣maining unshaken in thy carnal confidence, and supposing thyself <HI>wiser than seven men that can render a reason,</HI> thou not only despisest the testimony of the sacred writers and our pious reformers, laid before thee in the first part of this treatise, but disregardest the numerous ar∣guments it contains, tramplest under foot both <HI>matter of fact</HI> and <HI>common sense,</HI> and remainest unaffected by the most dreadful consequences of self-ignorance on the one hand, and by the
<PB N="202" REF="017930_0199_0FA37D98E3839D20"/>
greatest advantages of self-knowledge on the other; I have done, and must take my leave of <HI>thee.</HI></P>
<P>May the merciful and holy God, whose laws thou dost daily violate, whose word thou hourly opposest or forgettest, whose salvation thou dost every moment neglect, whose vengeance thou continually provokest, and whose cause I have attempted to plead, bear with thee and thy in∣sults a little longer!—May his infinite patience yet afford thee some means of conviction, more effectual than that which is at present in thy hands!—Or, shouldest thou look into this la∣bour of love once more, may it then answer a better purpose than to aggravate thy guilt, and enhance thy condemnation, by rendering the folly of thy unbelief more glaring, and con∣sequently more inexcusable!</P>

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO The Serious Reader, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING taken my leave of the thought∣less and gay, who regard an appeal to their reason, as little as they do the warnings of their conscience; I return to thee, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This address is only calculated for <HI>serious per∣sons,</HI> who cordially assent to the doctrine established in the <HI>Rational Demonstration of our fallen and lost Estate.</HI> As other readers have been dismissed with the portion of truth that belongs to them, they are desired not to meddle with <HI>this,</HI> lest their cavils con∣firm St. Paul's observation, <HI>We preach Christ crucified, to the</HI> self-righteous <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a stumbling-block, and to the</HI> self-conceited <HI>Greeks foolishness.</HI></NOTE> serious and well-disposed reader. I am too much concerned for thy soul's welfare, to lay down my pen, with∣out shewing thee more perfectly the way to the kingdom of heaven, by <HI>testifying to</HI> thee <HI>repent∣ance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Thou art happily weary of feeding upon the husks of earthly vanities. I have a right there∣fore, as a steward of the mysteries of God, to bring out of the divine treasury, the pearls of evangelical truth; and I gladly cast them before
<PB N="208" REF="017930_0203_0FA37D9BCF20A288"/>
<HI>thee,</HI> persuaded, that far from awakening thy anger, they will excite thy desires, and animate thy languid hopes.</P>
<P>Instead of ridiculing, or dreading an heart-felt conviction of thy lost estate, thou now seest it is a desirable privilege, an invaluable blessing. Ready to mourn, because thou canst not mourn, thou complainest, that thou hast only a confused view of thy total depravity. Thou wantest the feelings of the royal penitent, when he said, <HI>Be∣hold, I was shapen in iniquity,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I acknowledge my transgressions,</HI> and <HI>my sin is ever before me</HI>; but conscious thou canst not raise them in thy heart by natural powers, thou desirest some scriptural directions suitable to thy case. Give me leave to introduce them by a few</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="reflections">
<HEAD><HI>PRELIMINARY REFLECTIONS</HI> on the nature and depth of penitential sorrow.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. Thou knowest, that <HI>except thou</HI> truly <HI>re∣pentest, thou shalt</HI> surely <HI>perish,</HI> and that there is no true repentance, where there is not true sor∣row for sin. <HI>I rejoice,</HI> says St. Paul to the Co∣rinthians, <HI>that ye were made sorry after a godly manner: For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation, not to be repented of; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</HI> Hence it appears, that there are two sorts of sorrow springing from opposite sources; <HI>God</HI> and <HI>the world</HI>; the one a <HI>godly sorrow,</HI> and the other <HI>the sorrow of the world.</HI> Learn to distinguish them by their various causes and effects, so shalt thou avoid the danger of mistaking the one for the other.</P>
<P>The sorrow of the world, which many cover
<PB N="209" REF="017930_0204_0FA37D9C8BEDBDD0"/>
with the cloak of religion, arises from fear of con∣tempt, dread of poverty, secret jealousy, revenge dissatisfied, love disappointed, baffled schemes, losses in business, unkindness of friends, provo∣cation of enemies, or the death of some idolized relative. Nay, this sorrow may sometimes spring from a mixture of self-righteous pride and slavish fear. Some cannot bear to be robbed of their fond hopes of meriting heaven by their ima∣ginary good works: They lose all patience, when they see their best righteousness brought to light, and exposed as <HI>filthy rags:</HI> They are cut to the heart, when they hear, that their ap∣parent good deeds deserve punishment as well as their black enormities: Or like condemned male∣factors, they dread the consequences of their crimes, while they feel little or no horror for the crimes themselves.</P>
<P>Exceedingly fatal are the effects of this sor∣row, in the persons whom it overcomes: Their indignant hearts, unable to bear either disap∣pointment, contradiction, or condemnation, rise against second causes, or against the decrees of providence; fret at the strictness of the law, or holiness of the Lawgiver; and pine away with uninterrupted discontent. Hence, spurning at advice, direction, and consolation, they wring their hands, or <HI>gnaw their tongues with anguish</HI>; impatience works them up into stupid sullen∣ness, or noisy murmuring; they complain, that their <HI>punishment is greater than they can bear</HI>; and, imagining they are more severely dealt with than others, they hastily conclude. <HI>Behold, this evil is from the Lord, why should I wait for him any longer?</HI> Thus black despair seizes upon their spirits; and, if grace does not interpose, they either live on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fill up the measure of their
<PB N="210" REF="017930_0205_0FA37D9D459CA928"/>
iniquities, as Cain, Pharaoh, and Haman; or madly lay violent hands upon themselves, as Ahitophel, and Judas.</P>
<P>This sorrow cannot be too much guarded against, as it not only destroys many persons, but does immense hurt to religion. For those who are glad of any pretence to pour contempt upon godliness, taking occasion from the in∣stances of this sorrow, harden their own hearts, and prejudice all around them against the blessed, <HI>godly</HI> sorrow, which every minister of the gospel endeavours to excite; maliciously representing it as one and the same with the mischievous <HI>sor∣row of the world.</HI></P>
<P>Their mistake will be evident, if we trace godly sorrow back to its source. It does not spring merely from fear of punishment; but chiefly from humbling views of God's holiness, the impurity of the human nature, the exceed∣ing sinfulness of sin, and the transcendent ex∣cellency of the law, which condemns the sinner.</P>
<P>And this happy sorrow differs not less from the other in its effects, than it does in its cause. The persons who are blessed with it, far from murmuring, or fretting at the divine command∣ments, see it to be <HI>holy, just, and good,</HI> both in its preceptive and penal part. They so abso∣lutely acquicsce in it, that they would not alter it, if they could. They clear God, accuse themselves, subscribe their own sentence, and ac∣knowledge, <HI>It is of the Lord's mercies, that we are not consumed.</HI> Each of them can say, <HI>Wherefore should a living man complain, a man for the pu∣nishment of sins? It is good that he should both hope, and quietly wait for God's salvation: I will there∣fore watch to see what he will say unto me, for he will speak peace unto his people.</HI>
<PB N="211" REF="017930_0206_0FA37D9E0DED8958"/>
Thus in a constant use of all the ordinances of God, they meekly wait, wrestling with their unbelieving fears, till victorious <HI>faith comes by hearing</HI> of the matchless love of Jesus Christ; and then, <HI>fearing the Lord and his goodness,</HI> they <HI>sing the song of the Lamb,</HI> and run upon his de∣lightful errands.</P>
<P>As thou seest, serious reader, the nature, ne∣cessity, and excellence of <HI>godly sorrow,</HI> thou art probably desirous of being informed, how deep thine must be, to constitute thee a <HI>true</HI> penitent. Know then, that it must be deep enough to im∣bitter thy most pleasing, profitable, and ha∣bitual sins, and to prevent thy resting without a clear sense of thy peculiar interest in Christ.— It must be profound enough to make him and his gospel infinitely precious to thee, and to pro∣duce, under God, the blessed effects mentioned in the fifth part of the preceding treatise.</P>
<P>To be more particular, a true penitent may certainly without despair or madness, go as far in godly sorrow, as David does in his peniten∣tial psalms, or our church in the first part of the homily on fasting.
<Q>When good men, <HI>says she,</HI> feel in themselves the heavy burden of sin, see damnation to be the reward of it, and behold with the eye of their mind the horror of hell, they tremble, they quake, they are inwardly touched with sorrowfulness of heart for their offences, and cannot but accuse themselves, and open their grief unto Almighty God, and call on him for mercy. This being done se∣riously, their mind is so occupied, partly with sorrow and heaviness, partly with an earnest desire to be delivered from this danger of hell and damnation, that all desire of meat and drink is laid aside, and loathing of all worldly
<PB N="212" REF="017930_0207_0FA37D9ECAFE9728"/>
things and pleasures comes in place, so that they like nothing better than to weep, to la∣ment, to mourn, and both with words and be∣haviour of body, to shew themselves weary of this life.</Q></P>
<P>Nevertheless it must be observed, that godly sorrow needs not be equal, either in degree or duration, in all penitents. Those, whose hearts, through divine grace, open as readily and gently as that of Lydia, happily avoid many of David's pangs and Job's terrors. The powerful and in∣stantaneous, or the gentle and gradual manner, in which souls are awakened; the difference of constitutions; the peculiar services that a few are called to, and for which they are prepared by peculiar exercises; the horrid aggravations that have attended the sins of some; and the severe correction, which the Lord is obliged to give others, for their stout resistance against his grace—all this may help us to account for the various depths of distress, through which differ∣ent penitents pass in their way to Christ and salvation.</P>
<P>The Lord does not needlessly afflict the chil∣dren of men, any more than a tender father un∣necessarily corrects his disobedient children: He only wants us to forsake our sins, renounce our own imaginary righteousness, and come to Christ to be made partakers of his merits, holi∣ness, and felicity. The sorrow, which answers these ends, is quite sufficient; though it should be ever so light, and of ever so short a duration. On the contrary, a distress as heavy as that of Judas is unavailable, if instead of driving us from sin to Jesus Christ, it only drives us from profaneness to hypocrisy, or from presumption to despair.</P>

But the Lord has graciously ap∣pointed means, in the right use of which, he never denies a sinner the convincing and con∣verting power of his blessed Spirit; and what they are, thou art informed in the following</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD><HI>DIRECTIONS,</HI> Proper for an half-awakened sinner, desirous of be∣ing duly convinced of his corrupt and lost estate.</HEAD>
<P N="2">II. Beware of <HI>Fools,</HI> that <HI>make a mock at</HI> sor∣row for sin, and at <HI>sin</HI> itself. Beware of those <HI>blind leaders of the blind,</HI> who <HI>having a form of godliness, deny the power thereof:</HI> Instead of point∣ing thee to the throne of grace, and bidding thee <HI>behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world,</HI> they will only direct thee to the church walls and communion table; and per∣haps, if they see thee under dejection of spirit for thy sins, they will recommend the play-house, the card-table, or what they call
<Q>a chear∣ful glass.</Q>
<HI>From such turn away,</HI> or they will persuade thee that repentance is melancholy; conviction of sin, despair; and the love of God, enthusiasm, 2 Tim. iii. 5.</P>
<P>That they may not be able to laugh, or frown thee out of the way of salvation, dwell in thy thoughts on God's awful perfections. <HI>Justice and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</HI> The
<PB N="214" REF="017930_0209_0FA37DA0474D1C30"/>
unspotted, resplendent holiness beaming forth from him, as from an immensely glorious Sun of Righteousness, will shew thee thy sins as in∣numerable as the flying motes discovered in a dusty room, where the natural sun can pene∣trate. Consider that they are committed by a worm of earth, against the Majesty of heaven; and they will all appear to thee infinitely great: especially if thou measurest them, and thyself by the true rule, the oracles of God; casting away the three false standards which self-deceivers measure themselves by, namely, the good opinion of their worldly-minded neighbours, the defect∣ive examples of their fellow-sinners, and the flattering suggestions of their own blind self-love.</P>
<P>Follow the example of <HI>the noble Bereans: Search the scriptures daily, whether these things are so,</HI> Acts xvii. 11. View in that faithful mir∣ror, the picture both of the natural and of the regenerate man, and ask thy conscience which thou resemblest most. If, imitating the godly man described in the first psalm, thou <HI>meditatest in the law of the Lord day and night</HI>; the strait∣ness of the heavenly rule will soon shew thee how very far gone thy thoughts, words, actions, tempers, and nature, are from original righte∣ousness.</P>
<P>To this meditation, add a frequent survey of the follies of thy childhood, the vanity of thy youth, the worldly-mindedness of thy riper years, the capital transgressions which consci∣ence accuses thee of, and the <HI>hardness of heart,</HI> and <HI>alienation from the life of God,</HI> that the scrip∣tures charge thee with. Confess all to the Lord as thou art able, remembering that the wages of sin is <HI>death,</HI> who flies fast upon thee
<PB N="215" REF="017930_0210_0FA37DA10EFC5978"/>
with the wings of time—<HI>Death,</HI> who often gives no warning, and ushers in <HI>judgment,</HI> with all the horrors of <HI>hell,</HI> or the joys of <HI>heaven</HI>; and pray, that these awful realities may affect thee now, as they will in thy last moments.</P>
<P>Frequently reflect, how total must be our loss of spiritual life, which cannot be repaired but by a <HI>resurrection,</HI> a <HI>new birth,</HI> or <HI>a new crea∣tion,</HI> Col. iii. 1. John iii. 7. Gal. vi. 5. and how desperate the disease of our fallen nature, which cannot be healed but with the blood of a divine Physician. <HI>Consider,</HI> attentively consi∣der <HI>Him,</HI> whose piercing look softened the ob∣durate heart of cursing Peter, whose amazing sufferings brought an hardened thief under the deepest concern for his salvation, and whose dy∣ing groans <HI>rent the rocks, shook the earth, and opened the graves.</HI> The tender flower of evan∣gelical sorrow grows best in the shade of his cross: A believing view of him, as suffering for thee, will melt thee into penitential tears, and seal upon thy relenting heart the gracious pro∣mise, <HI>They shall look upon him, whom they have pierced, and mourn,</HI> Zech. xii. 10.</P>
<P>In the mean time, improve the daily oppor∣tunities, which thou hast of studying human corruption in the life and tempers of all around thee, but chiefly in thy own careless and deceit∣ful heart: Take notice of its pride and self-seeking, of its risings and secret workings, espe∣cially when unexpected temptations trouble thy imaginary peace of mind: For, at such a time, thy corruption, like the sediment in the bottom of a vial that is shaken, will shew its loathsom∣ness and strength.</P>
<P>Converse frequently, if thou canst, with per∣sons deeply convinced of sin. Attend a plain,
<PB N="216" REF="017930_0211_0FA37DA1CBBB0570"/>
heart-searching ministry as often as possible; and when the sword of the Spirit, the word of God, pierces thy soul, beware of fretful impatience. Instead of rising with indignation against the preacher, and saying, as proud Ahab did to the man of God, <HI>Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?</HI> account him thy best friend, that wounds thee deepest, provided he brings thee to Christ for a cure: And when the arrows of the word fly abroad, drop the shield of unbelief, make bare thy breast, welcome the blessed shaft, and re∣member, that the only way of conquering sin, is to fall wounded and helpless at the Redeemer's feet.</P>
<P>Nevertheless the impressions of the word will soon wear off, if thou dost not importunately intreat the Searcher of hearts, to light the candle of his grace in thy soul, that thou mayest clearly see whether thy <HI>inward parts</HI> are <HI>holiness to the Lord,</HI> as thou fondly supposest; or <HI>very wicked∣ness,</HI> as the scripture testifies. It is only in God's light, that we can clearly discover our blindness.</P>
<P>This <HI>light,</HI> it is true, <HI>shineth in darkness,</HI> but frequently <HI>the darkness comprehendeth it not.</HI> That this be not thy dreadful case, do not <HI>grieve</HI> and <HI>quench the</HI> convincing <HI>Spirit,</HI> by persisting in the <HI>wilful</HI> omission of any duty, or <HI>deliberate</HI> com∣mission of any sin: Nothing but <HI>obstinate unbe∣lief</HI> darkens the mind, and hardens the heart, more than this. Therefore instead of burying thy <HI>one talent</HI> with <HI>the slothful servant,</HI> earnestly pray the Lord to make thee faithful to thy con∣victions, and to deepen them daily till they end in a sound conversion.</P>
<P>In order to this, do not slightly heal the wound in thy conscience: It is better to keep
<PB N="217" REF="017930_0212_0FA37DA2843BD108"/>
it open, than to skin it over by improper means: Many, through a natural forwardness and im∣patience, have recourse to them; and ruin is the consequence of their mistake. That thou mayst avoid it, serious reader, I intreat thee to pay a due regard to the following</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="cautions">
<HEAD><HI>CAUTIONS,</HI> Proper for a penitent, who desires to make his calling and election <HI>SURE.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="3">III. When thou hast affecting views of thy lost estate, beware of resting like Felix in some pangs of fear, fits of trembling, and resolutions of turning to God by and by, <HI>when</HI> thou <HI>shalt have a convenient season.</HI> Neither give place to desponding thoughts, as if there was no appeal from the tribunal of justice to the throne of grace.</P>
<P>Run not for ease to vain company, bodily indulgence, entangling affections, immoderate sleep, excessive drinking, or hurry of business. <HI>Cain built a city</HI> to divert his trouble of mind, and multitudes like him, by <HI>the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, or the desire of other things,</HI> daily <HI>choak</HI> the good seed, the preci∣ous <HI>word</HI> of conviction, Mark iv, 19.</P>
<P>Be not satisfied with faint desires of living the life of the righteous, or idle wishes of dying their death. Remember that <HI>the desire of the slothful kills him:</HI> and if thou hast experienced some drawings of grace, meltings of heart, or breathings after God; sit not down at last, as the Laodiceans, in a careless state, <HI>neither hot nor cold.</HI> It is far better to go on thy way
<PB N="218" REF="017930_0213_0FA37DA43A00E850"/>
weeping, and seeking <HI>the pearl of great price</HI> till thou really find it, than to rest contented with an hasty conceit that thou art possessed of it, when thou art not.</P>
<P>Stop not in an outward reformation, and a form of godliness, like many, who mistake the <HI>means</HI> or <HI>doctrines of grace</HI> for grace itself; and because they say their heartless prayers both in public and private, or go far and often to hear the gospel preached in its purity, fondly hope, that they are the favourites of God, and in the high way to heaven.</P>
<P>Under pretence of increasing thy convictions, do not bury them in heaps of religious books. Some read till their heads are confused, or their hearts <HI>past feeling.</HI> Thus, though <HI>ever learning, they are never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Hear</HI> then, as well as <HI>read</HI> the word of life; but think not thyself converted when thou hast <HI>received it with joy:</HI> The stony-ground hearers went as far as this: <HI>Herod</HI> himself <HI>heard John gladly, honoured him, did many things,</HI> but left the most important undone; for he never dismissed the incestuous woman he lived with; and at last sacrificed to her revenge, the honest preacher he once admired.</P>
<P>Do not confound the <HI>covenant of works</HI> made with <HI>innocent</HI> Adam <HI>before</HI> the fall, and the <HI>co∣venant of grace</HI> made with <HI>sinful</HI> Adam <HI>after</HI> the fall, Gen. ii. 17. and iii. 15. and Rom. v. 11.—21. They are excellent in their place, but when they are mixed together, they destroy each other's efficacy. The dreadful thunders, heard in paradise lost; and the melodious songs uttered in paradise regained, do not strike <HI>at once</HI> the same spiritual ear. The galling yoke of the law of works, and the heavy load of its con∣demnation
<PB N="219" REF="017930_0214_0FA37DA4EDC66DF8"/>
are dropt; when we take upon us Christ's easy yoke, and submit to his light bur∣den. In a word, the first Adam gives place to the second when we <HI>find rest unto our souls.</HI> Let then the <HI>curse</HI> of the law of innocence, be swal∣lowed by the <HI>blessing</HI> of the gospel: or rather, let it make way for the grace of Christ in thy soul, as an emetic makes way for a cordial in a disordered stomach. If thou takest them to∣gether, their respective use is prevented. The first covenant loses its <HI>humbling</HI> efficacy, and the second its <HI>restorative</HI> power. Therefore, if thou hast really <HI>received the sentence of death in thyself</HI>; leave the curse of the first covenant in the grave of Christ, <HI>crucified for thy sins</HI>; and welcome the pardoning, renovating grace of Christ, <HI>risen again for thy justification.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, rest not contented with speculative knowledge, and unaffecting, though clear ideas of the gospel-way of salvation. Light in an unrenewed understanding, mistaken for the <HI>mystery of faith in a pure heart,</HI> like an ignis fatuus, or false light, leads thousands through the bogs of sin into the pit of destruction, Acts viii. 13.</P>
<P>Pacify not thy conscience by activity in out∣ward services, and a warmth in God's cause: Party spirit, or natural steadiness in carrying on a favourite scheme, yea, or seeking thy own glory, may be the springs that set thee on work. Jehu faithfully destroyed Baal and Jezebel, but his zeal for the Lord covered the secret desire of a crown. Take care also not to mistake gifts for graces; fluency of speech for convert∣ing power, the warmth of natural affection for divine love; or an impulse of God's Spirit, on some particular occasion, for an evidence of
<PB N="220" REF="017930_0215_0FA37DA588188E38"/>
spiritual regeneration, Balaam spoke and pro∣phesied like a child of God, and <HI>many will one day say to</HI> Christ, <HI>Lord, have we not prophesied, spoke all mysteries, cast out devils, and done many wonderful works in thy name?</HI> to whom he will answer, <HI>Depart from me, I know you not.</HI></P>
<P>Avoid the self-conceit of many, who feed on the corrupted manna of their past experiences, and confidently appeal to the wasted streams of those consolations, which once refreshed their hearts; when, alas! it is evident, <HI>they have</HI> now <HI>forsaken the fountain of living water,</HI> and <HI>hewn to themselves broken cisterns that held no water</HI>; un∣less the mire of evil tempers, selfish views, and heartless professions of faith, may pass for <HI>the streams which gladden the city of God.</HI></P>
<P>Neither do thou heal thyself by touches of sorrow, by tears, good desires, or outward marks of humiliation for sin, as king Ahab. Nor by excessive fasting, retiring from business, or hard usage of the body, as many Roman Catholics: nor yet by misapplying the doctrine of predesti∣nation, and setting down notions of election for evidences of salvation, as many Protestants: No, nor by <HI>doting about questions, strifes of words, and perverse disputings, which eat as a canker,</HI> as some in St. Paul's days, and too many in ours, 1 Tim. vi. 4.</P>
<P>To conclude, think not thou art abso∣lutely made whole when the power of outward sin is weakened or suspended, when thou hast learned the language of Canaan, canst speak or write well on spiritual subjects, art intimately acquainted with the best ministers of Christ, and hast cast thy lot among the despised chil∣dren of God, taken their part, shared in their reproach, and secured their esteem and prayers.

Judas did so for years: <HI>Saul was</HI> once <HI>also among the prophets:</HI> Ananias and Sapphira were sup∣posed to be good believers for a time, the foolish virgins joined in society with the wise, and were perhaps unsuspected, to the last; and Peter himself stood in need of <HI>conversion,</HI> long after he had outwardly <HI>left all to follow Christ,</HI> Luke xxii. 32. So important is that charge of our Lord! <HI>Strive to enter in at the strait gate, for many will seek to enter in and shall not be able.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>EVANGELICAL EXHORTATION,</HI> Pointing out the divine method of a sound cure, which, though least regarded, and last tried, by most sinners, is not only effectual in some, but in∣fallible in <HI>ALL</HI> cases.</HEAD>
<P N="4">IV. Wouldst thou, serious reader, be made whole in an evangelical manner? To thy con∣victions of original and actual sins, must be added a conviction of unbelief. Feel then, that thou hast neglected Christ's great salvation: Own thou didst never ask, or never persevere in asking the unfeigned, saving, powerful faith, by which <HI>the atonement is received</HI> and enjoyed, Rom. V. 11. Acknowledge, that the faith thou hast hitherto rested in, was not <HI>that gift of God,</HI> that grace <HI>of his own operation, wrought in thee according to the working of his mighty power,</HI> and mentioned Eph. ii. 8. Col. ii. 12. Eph. i. 19. And confess, it was not the right Christian
<PB N="222" REF="017930_0217_0FA37DA70B964B18"/>
faith; because it chiefly grew from the seed of prejudice and education, as the faith of Jews and Turks; and not from the seed of divine grace and power, as the faith of St. Paul, Gal. i. 15. and because it never yielded the heavenly fruits which <HI>gospel faith</HI> infallibly produces: Such as—<HI>a vital union with Christ,</HI> Gal. ii. 20. <HI>The pardon of sins,</HI> Col. i. 14. Acts xiii. 30.—<HI>Peace with God,</HI> Rom. v. 1.—<HI>Dominion over sin,</HI> Rom. vi. 14.—<HI>Victory over the world,</HI> 1 John v. 4.— <HI>The crucifixion of the flesh,</HI> Gal. v.—<HI>Power to quench the fiery darts of the wicked,</HI> Eph. vi. 15.— <HI>Joy unspeakable,</HI> 1 Pet. i. 8.—<HI>And the salvation of thy soul,</HI> 1 Pet. i. 9. Heb. x. 39.</P>
<P>Be not afraid of this conviction of unbelief; for it generally goes before divine faith, as the fermentation of a grain of corn in the earth, is previous to its shooting its stalk towards heaven. <HI>God concludes,</HI> shuts us up <HI>in unbelief,</HI> says St. Paul, <HI>that he may have mercy upon</HI> us, Rom. xi. 32. <HI>When the comforter is come,</HI> says our Lord, <HI>he will convince the world of sin, because they believe not in me.</HI> This is the transgression which peculiarly deserves the name of <HI>sin,</HI> as being the <HI>damning</HI> sin according to the gospel, Mark xvi. 16. the sin that binds upon us the guilt of all our other iniquities, and keeps up the power of all our corruptions. Its immediate effect is to <HI>harden the heart,</HI> Mark xvi. 14. and make <HI>it depart from the living God,</HI> Heb. iii 12: and this hardness and departure are the genuine parents of all our actual sins, the number and blackness of which increases or decreases, as the strength of unbelief grows or decays.</P>
<P>A conviction of this sin is of the utmost im∣portance, as nothing but an affecting sense of its heinousness and power, can make us entirely
<PB N="223" REF="017930_0218_0FA37DA7CBC6F420"/>
weary of ourselves—nothing but a sight of its destructive nature can prevent our resting with∣out a compleat cure.</P>
<P>But when thou art once convinced of unbe∣lief, do not increase the difficulty of believing, by imagining true faith at an immense distance. Consider it as very near thy heart. That which convinces thee of sin and unbelief can in a mo∣ment, and with the greatest ease, convince thee of righteousness, and <HI>reveal in thee Christ the hope of glory.</HI> How quickly can the Spirit take of the things that belong to him, and show them unto thee! <HI>Say not</HI> then <HI>in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven, or descend into the deep</HI> to get me the seed of faith? But let St. Paul shew thee <HI>the new and living way. The word is nigh thee,</HI> says he, <HI>even in thy mouth and in thy heart, that is the word of faith which we preach; that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved</HI>; for <HI>we are saved by faith; faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Hear</HI> then <HI>the word of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Are thy sins really grievous to thee? Is the burden of them intolerable? Wouldst thou part with it at any rate? Dost thou fully ronounce thy speculative and barren faith? Hast thou re∣ceived the sentence of eternal death in thy con∣science, acknowledging thy case [for any thing thou canst do without Christ] helpless, hopeless, desperate? And art thou truly brought to the grand enquiry, <HI>What must I do to be saved?</HI> See, feel, confess, that thou standest in absolute need of a divine Physician, an almighty Redeemer; and, that the God-man Jesus Christ, joins both those extraordinary characters in his wonderful
<PB N="224" REF="017930_0219_0FA37DA8879690E0"/>
person. Submit to be <HI>saved by grace,</HI> by free grace, through his infinite merits, and not thy wretched deserts; and, instead of opposing, con∣tinually study God's wonderful method of saving sinners, the worst of sinners, <HI>by faith</HI> in his blood.</P>
<P><HI>There is no name but his under heaven, whereby we must be saved; neither is there</HI> cure, or <HI>salva∣tion in any other,</HI> Acts iv. 12. As <HI>by him all things were created,</HI> so <HI>by him they subsist,</HI> and by him they must be restored. The power of his word and breath, made man a living soul; and now that we are dead to God, the same power, applying his blood and righteousness, must <HI>create in us clean hearts,</HI> and <HI>renew right spirits within us.</HI> This, and this only, heals wounded consciences, washes polluted souls, and raises the dead in trespasses and sins.</P>
<P>Wouldst thou then be made whole? <HI>Deter∣mine,</HI> as St. Paul, <HI>to know nothing but Christ, and him crucified:</HI> Aim at believing, realizing, ap∣plicatory views of what he is, and what he has done and suffered for thee. Through all the clouds of thy guilt and unbelief, which will va∣nish before our <HI>Sun of Righteousness,</HI> as mists be-before the material sun, <HI>behold him as the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world,</HI> and thine.—See the immense dignity of his person; <HI>He is God over all blessed for ever</HI>; and yet he condescends to be <HI>Emanuel, God with us, flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone.</HI>—Consider the in∣expressible value, and inconceivable efficacy of his precious, all-atoning blood. It is the blood of the sacred body, assumed by the eternal Lo∣gos, when he <HI>appeared in the likeness of sinful flesh,</HI> both as a victim and a priest, to suffer the penalty of his own righteous law for us, and to

<HI>put away sin by the sacrifice of himself</HI>—the blood of <HI>the Lamb of God, slain to sprinkle many nations</HI>— the blood of that mysterious Being, who fills <HI>the bosom of the Father,</HI> and the everlasting throne, at whose feet all the heavenly powers <HI>cast their crowns</HI>; and to whom, in the midst of the acclammations and adorations of <HI>an innu∣merable company of angels,</HI> in the midst of <HI>sound∣ing trumpets, thunderings, lightnings, and voices, the spirit of just men made perfect ascribe salvation,</HI> free, full, immensely dear-bought <HI>salvation:</HI> And, to say all in one word, it is <HI>the blood of God manifest in the flesh,</HI> Acts xx. 28. 1 Tim. iii. 16. For JEHOVAH <HI>our righteousness</HI> is <HI>the Seed of the woman and the Son of man:</HI> The Godhead and the manhood are wonderfully joined in him: And in consequence of this mysterious union, he is not only a proper <HI>mediator between God and man,</HI> but the sole medium of reconciliation and union, between the offended Majesty of heaven and the rebellious sons of Adam. As the brazen serpent lifted up in the wilderness, when viewed by the wounded Israelites, was the only means by which the poison of the fiery serpents could be expelled, and health restored to their tortured, dying bodies: So Jesus lifted up on the cross, when beheld by the eye of faith, as bleeding and dying in our stead, is the only way by which sin, the sting of death, can be extracted out of our guilty, perishing souls: the only antidote that can restore us to saving health and eternal life, John iii, 14. Apply whatever we will, besides this sovereign remedy, we may poison, but can never heal the enve∣nomed and mortal wound.</P>
<P>But remember, sinner, that faith alone can make the blessed application. Adam fell by re∣jecting
<PB N="226" REF="017930_0221_0FA37DAA08C8F278"/>
in unbelief the word of threatning, and thou canst never rise, but by receiving in faith <HI>the word of reconciliation,</HI> Gen. ii. 17. 2 Cor. v. 19. Instead then of confusing thy thoughts, and scattering thy desires by the pursuit of a variety of objects; remember that <HI>one thing is needful</HI> for thee—Christ and his salvation received by faith: <HI>For, to as many as receive him, he gives power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</HI> Beseech him, therefore, to manifest himself to thee by his word and Spirit. <HI>He is the author and finisher of faith,</HI> the <HI>giver of every good and perfect gift</HI>; ask of him an heart-felt confidence, that <HI>God so loved</HI> thee, <HI>as to give his only begotten Son, that thou shouldst not perish, but have everlasting life,</HI> a firm confidence, that as the first Adam wilfully ruined thee; so he, <HI>the second Adam,</HI> freely <HI>loved thee,</HI> and <HI>gave himself for thee:</HI> And that thou <HI>hast redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins,</HI> not <HI>according to</HI> thy merits, but <HI>the riches of his grace.</HI></P>
<P>The least degree of this divinely-wrought confidence, will begin to attract and unite thy soul to him, who <HI>is our life</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> our <HI>strength and righteousness.</HI> The everlasting gospel will then be music in thine ears, and power in thy heart. Its chearful, solemn found, will raise thy drooping spirits, and make thee fix the eye of thy mind on <HI>the sign of the Son of man,</HI> the up-lifted banner of the cross: And oh! while the self-righteous see nothing there but the <HI>de∣spised, rejected man of sorrow,</HI> what wilt thou dis∣cover? <HI>God in Christ reconciling the world unto himself—God manifest in the flesh to destroy the works of the</HI> devil! Jehovah, <HI>Jesus, the Captain of our salvation, treading the wine-press of the fierceness and wrath of the Almighty! Of the people
<PB N="227" REF="017930_0222_0FA37DAACA7E62D8"/>
there was none with him, therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him.</HI></P>
<P>While the gospel <HI>trumpet is blown in Sion,</HI> and the self-hardened, scoffing infidel hears it with disdain and ridicule, what joy will the awful declarations convey to thy penitent and listening soul! With what rapturous delight wilt thou hang upon the lips of the messengers of peace, the sons of consolation, who preach free salva∣tion by the blood of Jesus! While he himself, <HI>confirming the word of his servants,</HI> says to the melting heart with his <HI>still, small,</HI> and yet pow∣erful, renovating <HI>voice: Behold, I sit upon my throne making all things new—The words that I speak are spirit and life—I do not condemn thee, thy sins are forgiven—Be thou clean—Thy faith hath saved thee—Go in peace and sin no more,</HI> Rev. xxi. 5. John vi. 63. Luke vii. 48.5O. Matt. viii. 3. John viii. 11.</P>
<P>And oh! what will thy believing, enlarged heart experience <HI>in that day of God's power,</HI> and thy spiritual birth! Christ, <HI>the true light of the world, the eternal life of men, coming suddenly to his temple,</HI> and filling it with the light of his countenance, and the power of his resurrection! Christ <HI>shedding abroad in thy</HI> ravished <HI>soul, the love of thy heavenly Father,</HI> thy bitterest ene∣mies, and all mankind! — In a word, <HI>the Holy Ghost given unto thee!</HI> Or, <HI>Christ dwelling in thy heart by faith!</HI> John i. 4. 1 John v. 12. Rom. viii. 15. and v. 5. Gal. i. 16. Eph. i. 13. and iii. 17.</P>
<P>Being thus <HI>made partakers of Christ,</HI> and <HI>of the Holy Ghost,</HI> Heb. iii. 14. &amp; vi. 4. thy loving heart, thy praising lips, thy blameless life will agree to testify, that <HI>the Son of man hath power on earth
<PB N="228" REF="017930_0223_0FA37DAB87BA9F58"/>
to forgive sins,</HI> and that <HI>if any man is in Christ, he is a new creature, old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new,</HI> Matt. ix. 6. 2 Cor. v. 17.</P>
<P>Till this is thy happy experience, pray (as the drawings of the Father, and convictions of the Spirit will enable thee) earnestly pray for living faith, for a <HI>faith</HI> that may be to thee <HI>the substance of</HI> the pardon thou <HI>hopest for,</HI> and <HI>the evidence</HI> of the great sacrifice thou <HI>dost not see,</HI> but which our divine Surety really offered upon the cross for <HI>thee.</HI> Consider how deplorable a thing it is, that thou shouldest be prevented from claiming, receiving, enjoying the delight∣ful knowledge of thy interest in the Redeemer's death; when his pardoning love, and <HI>the word of his grace,</HI> offer it thee <HI>without money and with∣out price,</HI> and absolutely nothing but infatuating unbelief, or spiritual sloth, keeps thee from the invaluable blessing. Be not satisfied idly to wait in the divine ordinances, till thou <HI>seest the kingdom of God come with power</HI>; but as the <HI>violent</HI> do, <HI>take it by force.</HI></P>
<Q><L>Prisoner of hope, be strong, be bold,</L>
<L>Cast off thy doubts, disdain to fear,</L>
<L>Dare to believe, on Christ lay hold;</L>
<L>Wrestle with Christ in mighty prayer:</L>
<L>Tell him, I will not let thee go,</L>
<L>Till I thy name, thy nature know.</L></Q>
<P>Be attentive to the calls of the Spirit, and follow the drawings of the Father, till they bring thee to the Son; and keep thine eye upon the dawning light of the gospel, till <HI>the morn∣ing star arise in thy heart.</HI> Venture, confi∣dently
<PB N="229" REF="017930_0224_0FA37DAC4252AE48"/>
venture upon the boundless mercy of God in Jesus Christ. If a spirit of infirmity bows thee down, yield not to it, <HI>seventy times seven times,</HI> try to arise and look up, calling aloud for help against it. Say, if possible, <HI>with tears,</HI> as the distrest father in the gospel, <HI>Lord, I believe,</HI> or, Lord, I would believe, <HI>help thou my unbelief:</HI> Or with tempted Job, <HI>Though thou slay me, yet will I trust in thee.</HI></P>
<P>In this manner knock with the earnestness of the importunate widow, till the door of faith open, and thou begin to <HI>see the salvation of God.</HI> But stop not here at the threshold of Christi∣anity. <HI>Have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.</HI> Go on <HI>from faith to faith,</HI> till thy <HI>day of Pentecost is fully come,</HI> till thou art <HI>endued with power from on high, baptized with the Holy Ghost and with fire, and sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,</HI> which Christ <HI>received of the Father,</HI> and <HI>abundantly shed on his servants and handmaids,</HI> when he was <HI>glorified.</HI> Compare Matt. iii. 11. Eph. i. 13. John vii. 39. Acts i. 5, 8. and ii. 33. 39. and viii. 15. and xix. 2. John vii. 39. Tit. iii. 6.</P>
<P>In the mean time, use all the means of grace with an eye to their end; <HI>stir up the gift</HI> of hope <HI>that is in thee</HI>; and to raise thy drooping ex∣pectation, receive the encouraging testimony of God's redeemed, praising people, whose hearts and tongues are ready to testify to thy ears, what the following lines declare to thine eyes.</P>

<P N="5">V. <HI>That which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that you also may have fellowship with us, and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. For the life was ma∣nifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness,

and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and is manifested unto us.</HI> Yes, <HI>we have found him, of whom Moses and the pro∣phets did write.</HI> From blessed experience we de∣clare, that the Messiah is come, that his essence is <HI>Love incarnate,</HI> his name <HI>free Salvation,</HI> and his delight the eternal happiness of the children of men. <HI>He is the chief among ten thousand</HI> pro∣phets, priests, kings, and saviours; <HI>he is alto∣gether lovely.</HI> We staked our souls upon his eternal truth, and it was done to us, both ac∣cording to his word and our faith: Therefore with humble joy we declare, that he answers the prayers, and delivers the souls of perishing sinners, as graciously as he did in the days of his flesh.</P>
<P>Upon trials, a thousand times successfully re∣peated, we proclaim him the help of the help∣less, the hope of the hopeless, the health of the sick, the strength of the weak, the riches of the poor, the peace of the disquieted, the comfort of the afflicted, the light of those that sit in darkness, the companion of the desolate, the friend of the friendless, the way of the bewildered, the wis∣dom of the foolish, the righteousness of the un∣godly, the sanctification of the unholy, the re∣demption of captives, the joy of mourners, the glory of the infamous, and in a word, the salva∣tion of the lost.</P>
<P>Though he was the Creator of men and an∣gels, he vouchsafed to be born of a woman, that we, the wretched offspring of degenerate Adam, might be born again, born of God. Though he had stretched forth the heavens like a cur∣tain, and bespangled them with stars innu∣merable; he wrapped himself in the scanty, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ding garment of our flesh, and put on the veil
<PB N="231" REF="017930_0226_0FA37DADC867CB60"/>
of our miserable humanity, that we might be invested with the glory, and communicable per∣fections of the divine nature. Though he was the King of kings, and Lord of lords, he did not disdain to take upon him the form and office of a servant, that we might be delivered from the slavery of Satan, and that angels might be sent forth to minister for us, who are the heirs of salvation. Though he was the <HI>fulness of him who fills all in all,</HI> he worked, that we might not want; toiled, that we might rest; and endured hunger and thirst, that we might taste the hidden manna, eat the bread of life, and drink with him the mystic wine of his Father's kingdom. His omnipotent word co∣vers a thousand hills with verdure, and clothes millions of creatures with rich furs, glittering scales, and shining plumage; but O infinite condescension! he submitted to be stript of his plain raiment, that our shame might not ap∣pear; he became naked, that we might be adorned with robes of righteousness, and gar∣ments of salvation. Though his riches were immense and unsearchable like himself, though heaven was his throne, and earth his footstool, he became poor, and was destitute of a place where to lay his head, that we might be rich in faith here, and heirs of the kingdom hereafter. Though he was, is now, and ever shall be the joy of the heavenly powers, and the object of their deepest adoration; he was voluntarily despised of men, that we might be honoured of God: He was acquainted too with griefs, that we might rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, Tho' supreme Lawgiver and Judge of all, matchless love made him yield to be judged, and unjustly condemned at Pilate's bar, that we might be

honourably acquitted, and gloriously rewarded before his awful tribunal. Though archan∣gels laid their crowns at his feet, and seraphim veiled their faces before him, unable to stand the dazzling effulgence of his glory; he suf∣fered himself to be derided, scoffed, spit upon, scourged, and crowned with thorns; that we might be acknowledged, applauded, embraced, and presented with never-fading crowns of righteousness and glory. <HI>The Lord of Hosts</HI> is his name; he is deservedly called <HI>Wonderful Counsellor, the everlasting Father, the mighty God, the Prince of peace</HI>; cherubic legions fly at his nod; and yet, astonishing humiliation! <HI>His shoulders, on which is laid the government</HI> of the world, felt the infamous load of a malefactor's cross; and barbarous soldiers, followed by an enraged mob, led him as a lamb to the slaugh∣ter, that we might be delivered from the heavy curse of the law, and gently conveyed by ce∣lestial powers into Abraham's bosom. <HI>Let all the angels of God worship him,</HI> is the great decree, to which the heavenly hierarchy submits with incessant transports of the most ardent devo∣tion. And yet he was crucified, as an execrable wretch, guilty of treason and blasphemy; that we, daring rebels and abominable sinners, might be <HI>made kings and priests unto God,</HI> partaking of <HI>his</HI> highest glory, as he partook of <HI>our</HI> deepest shame: And, to crown his loving-kindness, he expired in the midst of rending rocks, and a su∣pernatural darkness; that we might feel his tender mercies, and be indulged with the light of heaven, when we go through the dreary val∣ley of the shadow of death, to reap the joys of eternal life.</P>

<P>O the depth of the mystery of faith! O the breadth, the length, the height of the love of Christ! All his stupendous humiliation from his Father's bosom, through the virgin's womb, to the accursed tree; all his astonishing exalta∣tion, from the dust of the grave, and the sorrows of hell, to the joys of heaven, and the highest throne of glory; all his immense progress of in∣carnate love—all, all is ours! His mysterious
<PB N="234" REF="017930_0229_0FA37DB0DF02FAE8"/>
incarnation reunites and endears us to God; his natural birth procures our spiritual regenera∣tion; his unspotted life restores us to a blissful immortality; his bitter agony gives us calm re∣pose; his blooly sweat washes away our mani∣fold pollutions; his deep wounds distil the balm that heals our envenomed sores; his perfect obedience is our first title to endless felicity; his full atonement purchases our free justifica∣tion; his cruel death is the spring of immortal life; his grave, the gate of heaven; his resur∣rection, the pledge of glory; his ascension, the triumph of our souls; his sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high, the earnest of our future coronation and exalted felicity; and his prevailing intercession, the inexhaustible foun∣tain of all our blessings.</P>
<P>Come then, conscious sinner, come to the feast of pardoning love; taste with us, that the Lord is gracious. Let not a false humility de∣tain thee, under pretence, that 'thou art not 'yet humbled and broken enough for sin.' Alas! who can humble thee but Jesus, that say, <HI>Without me ye can do nothing?</HI> And how canst thou be <HI>broken,</HI> but by <HI>falling upon this chief cor∣ner-stone?</HI> If humiliation and contrition are parts of the salvation which he merited for thee, is it not the quintessence of self-righteousness, to attempt to obtain them without him? Away then, for ever away with such a dangerous excuse!</P>
<P>Nor let the remembrance of thy sins keep thee from the speediest application to Jesus for grace and pardon. What! though thy crimes are of the deepest dye, and most enormous mag∣nitude; though they are innumerable as the sand on the sea shore, and aggravated by the
<PB N="235" REF="017930_0230_0FA37DB1845DD7F8"/>
most uncommon and horrid circumstances; yet thou needest not despair: He has <HI>opened a foun∣tain for sin</HI> of every kind, <HI>and uncleanness</HI> of every degree; <HI>his blood cleanses from</HI> ALL <HI>sin.</HI></P>
<P>He is a Redeemer most eminently fitted, a Saviour most compleatly qualified to restore cor∣rupt, guilty, apostate, undone mankind; the vilest of the vile, the foulest of the foul not ex∣cepted. He is <HI>almighty,</HI> and therefore perfectly able to restore lapsed powers, root up inveterate habits, and implant heavenly tempers. He is <HI>love</HI> itself, compassionate, merciful, pardoning <HI>love,</HI> become incarnate for thee. And shall he, that spared not his own life, but delivered him∣self up for us all—shall he not with his own blood, also freely give us all things?</P>
<P>Behold, oh! behold him with the eye of thy faith: Cruelly torn with various instruments of torture, he hangs aloft on the accursed tree, be∣tween two of the most execrable malefactors; and there, insulted more than they, he bears our infamous load of guilt. <HI>He knows no sin,</HI> and yet <HI>he is made sin for us:</HI> He <HI>becomes a curse, to redeem us from the curse of the law: His own self bears our sins in his own body on the tree: He is wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace is upon him, God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all, and with his stripes we are healed.</HI></P>
<P>See, PARDON FOR LOST SINNERS is written with pointed steel and streaming blood, on his pierced hands and feet: The double flood is∣suing from his wounded side, more than seals the dear-bought blessing: The hand-writing against us, is nailed to his cross, and blotted out with his precious blood: His open arms in∣vite, draw, and welcome returning prodigals;
<PB N="236" REF="017930_0231_0FA37DB24443C818"/>
and there encircled, the worst of sinners may find a safe and delightful retreat, a real and pre∣sent heaven.</P>
<P>O sinner, let thy heart fly thither on the wings of eager expectation and impetuous de∣sire —By all that is near, dear, and sacred to thee, fly—Fly from eternal death—Fly for eter∣nal life. The <HI>law,</HI> violated by ten thousand transgressions, pursues thee with ten thousand curses: The sword of <HI>divine vengeance</HI> flames over thy devoted head: <HI>Sin,</HI> the sting of death, has been a thousand times shot into thy wretched breast; its subtle and dire poison continually works in thy hardened, or distressed heart: <HI>Guilt,</HI> the sting of sin—the never-dying worm, perpe∣tually benumbs thy stupid soul, or gnaws thy restless conscience: <HI>Raging Lusts,</HI> those sparks of the fire of hell, which nothing but the blood of the cross can quench; or <HI>fierce Passions,</HI> those flashes of infernal lightning, that portend an impending storm, frequently break out in thy benighted soul; an heart-felt pledge of torment∣ing flames: <HI>Satan,</HI> whom thou hast perhaps in∣voked by horrid imprecations, goes about as a roaring lion, seeking to ensnare his careless votary, or devour his desperate worshippers: <HI>Death</HI> levels his pointed spear at thy thoughtless or throbbing heart: <HI>Hell</HI> itself is moved from beneath, to meet thee at thy coming; and <HI>the Grave</HI> gapes at thy feet, ready to close her hi∣deous mouth upon her accursed prey.</P>
<P>Fly then, miserable sinner—if thy flesh is not brass, and thou canst not dwell with everlasting burnings, fly for shelter to the bloody cross of Jesus. There thou wilt meet <HI>him, who was, and is, and is to come; Emanuel, God with us,</HI> who appeared as the son of man, to <HI>make his

soul an offering for sin,</HI> for <HI>thy</HI> sin; and saved thy life from destruction, by losing his own in pangs, which made the sun turn pale, shook the earth, and caused the shattered graves to give up their dead.</P>
<P>He is even now near to thy heart; he stands at the door, and gently knocks by the word of his grace. If thou hearest his voice, and openest by believing, he will come in; the word of re∣conciliation shall be powerfully ingrafted in thy heart; thou shalt know, experimentally know the <HI>truth,</HI> and the <HI>truth</HI> shall make thee free. Assured that he hath by himself purged thy sins, abolished death, and brought life and immor∣tality to light through the gospel, thou shalt sup with him and he with thee; thou shalt eat the bread of God, which came down from hea∣ven, to give life to a perishing world. Evan∣gelical <HI>truth</HI> received by faith, will heal, nourish, comfort, and sanctify thy soul.</P>
<P>But perhaps thy guilty heart receives no con∣solation from these lines. Thou still considerest Christ: only as a severe Lawgiver, or as an in∣flexible Judge; and not as the <HI>propitiation for thy sins,</HI> and thy gracious, all-prevailing Advo∣cate with the Father. Oh! how dost thou wrong both him and thyself, by such false con∣ceptions! And how soon would thy gloomy fears give place to triumphant joy, if thy thoughts of him corresponded with his gracious designs concerning thee!</P>
<P>Wouldst thou know him better; behold him through the glass of his word, and not through the mist of thy fears; and thou wilt see that, far from watching over thee for evil, he fixes upon thee the piercing eye of his redeeming love; waits, that he may be gracious to thy

Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, says the Lord; speak ye comfortably to Jeru∣salem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, and her iniquity is pardoned; for, in me, she hath received of the Lord's hand, double for all her sins: He is well pleased for my righteousness sake, I have magnified the law, and made it honourable; I have been lifted up, and now I draw all men unto me. My delights are with the sons of men, and therefore am I exalted, that I may have mercy upon them. Behold, I come with a strong hand, my reward is with me, and my work before me. Every valley shall be

Seek ye me while I may be found, call upon me while I am near: Return unto me, and I will have mercy upon you; and though ye have only done evil be∣fore me from your youth, I will abundantly pardon: For my thoughts are not revengeful as your thoughts, nor my ways unloving as your ways: In me you shall be saved with an everlasting salvation.</P>

In∣cline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul shall live: I will make an ever∣lasting covenant with you, even the sure mer∣cies of David, and you shall all know me, from the least to the greatest; for I will for∣give your iniquity, and remember your sin no more.</P>

Or does the enemy of thy soul suggest thou art careless, hardened, and sunk in stupid unbelief?—Does he insinuate, thou hast so long trifled with di∣vine grace, art gone such lengths in horrid wickedness, or hast contracted such unconquer∣able habits of indulging thy carnal mind, or following thy vain imaginations, that infinite mercy can no longer pardon thy sins, or infi∣nite power change thy nature? Art thou even tempted to believe, thou hast committed the sin against the Holy Ghost, and art almost, if not altogether, given up to a reprobate mind? O check those gloomy, despairing thoughts; resist the devil; and give place to more true and ho∣nourable sentiments of Jesus.</P>
<P>Wherefore dost thou doubt, O thou of little faith? Is any thing too hard for the Lord? Are not all things possible with God? Can the Al∣mighty, who became incarnate to die, as man, in thy place, want either ability or willingness to help thee, be thy case ever so deplorable and desperate? Are not darkness or light, sickness or death, all one to him, who is <HI>the light of the world, and the Prince of life</HI>; and who, with a word or a touch, raised the dead, whether
<PB N="242" REF="017930_0237_0FA37DB6C75C4318"/>
they were yet warm on a bed, cold in a coffin, or already putrefied in a grave?</P>
<P>Confine not then, poor dejected sinner, thy Saviour's boundless mercy within the narrow limits of thy unbelieving thoughts. Get scrip∣tural views of his pardoning love, and true dis∣coveries of his redeeming power. To guess aright at the prodigious extent of his mercy, lift up the dim eyes of thy struggling faith, and behold a great multitude, which no man can number, standing before the throne, with their robes washed, and made white in the blood of the Lamb.</P>
<P>Among those countless monuments of di∣vine mercy, those illustrious trophies of free grace, see <HI>David,</HI> who, after having been admit∣ted to close communion with God, plunged for ten months in the horrible guilt of adultery, treachery, hypocrisy, and murder!—See <HI>Paul,</HI> once so fierce an enemy to the truth, so fiery a blasphemer of Jesus, so raging a persecutor of the saints, that his very <HI>breath</HI> was <HI>threatnings and slaughter against them!</HI>—See <HI>Peter,</HI> who, after a great profession of faithfulness, and upon an apparently slight temptation, denied three times his Master, his Saviour, and his God, in his very presence—<HI>Peter</HI> guilty of lying, cursing, and perjury; immediately after he had been ap∣prised of the imminent temptation, and armed against it, both by receiving the holy sacrament at our Lord's own hand, and being admitted to see his wonderful agony, and glorious miracles. These, and thousands more, agree to tell thee, <HI>For this cause we obtained mercy, that in us first, Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them, which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="017930_0238_0FA37DB78B39CB68"/>If all these witnesses do not silence thy doubts, and encourage thy hopes; Jesus himself, the faithful and true witness, will yet plead the cause of his dying love, against thy unbelieving fears: Thy gracious Advocate with God, will yet be God's condescending Advocate with thee. O let thy clamorous conscience keep silence, while he preaches to thee the everlasting gospel of his grace. And if to-day thou hearest his voice, harden not thy heart, come out of the cave of unbelief, wrap thyself in the mantle of divine mercy, and worship the pardoning God, the God of never-failing truth, and everlasting love.</P>
<P>Gracious Saviour! make thine own words spirit and life to the soul thou hast formed by thy breath and purchased with thy blood. Blessed Comforter! While thy precious sayings strike the eyes of this hopeless reader, let the love which thou sheddest abroad, soften, melt, and revive his poor, oppressed heart, and let salvation come this day to the house of a son or daughter of Abraham! A touch, a breath from thee, will break the bars of iron, burst the gates of brass, and make the everlasting doors lift up their heads, that the King of glory may come in.</P>
<P><HI>Who is this King of glory? Who is this, that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? This, that is glorious in his apparel, tra∣velling in the greatness of his strength?</HI></P>
<Q><P>I, that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. I have trodden the wine-press alone, mine own arm hath brought salvation unto me, salvation for the lost: It is gone forth; my righteousness is near; the isles shall wait on me, and on my arm shall they trust. The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me: He hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the
<PB N="244" REF="017930_0239_0FA37DB847ACC090"/>
meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound, to comfort all that mourn, and by the blood of the covenant, to send forth the prisoners out of the pit where there is no water.</P>
<P>Fear not, therefore, thou worm Jacob, I am the first and the last, he that liveth and was dead, and behold, I am alive for ever∣more. Yes, I ever live to make intercession for thee; and because I live, thou shalt live also. All power is given, all judgment is committed to me in heaven and earth: I have the keys of death and hell: A Jonah, who cries to me out of the very belly of hell, is not out of the reach of my gracious and om∣nipotent arm.</P>
<P>Who art thou, that hast feared continually every day, because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? I, even I, am he that comforteth thee. I bring glad tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. I have triumphed over all thine enemies on the cross. I have led captivity captive, and re∣ceived gifts for men, even the promise of the Fa∣ther, that the Lord God by the Spirit may dwell in them. At my command the great, the evangelical trumpet is blown, and they that are ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt do come, and are welcome to mount Sion. Hasten with them, thou captive exile, hasten to me, that thou mayst be loo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, and that thou shouldst not die in the horrible pit of thy natural state.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="017930_0240_0FA37DB90D8C6DF8"/>Thy helplessness is no hindrance to my loving-kindness: I break not the bruised reed, I quench not the smoaking flax: I uphold all that fall, I raise up all those that are bowed down: I say to the prisoners, Go forth; and to them that are in darkness, Shew your∣selves: I strengthen the weak hands, and con∣firm the feeble knees: I say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not; be∣hold, I will come with vengeance and a re∣compence, I will come and save you.</P>
<P>My tender mercies are over all my works. When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst; I, the Lord, will hear them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them, I will open rivers in high places, I will make the wilderness a pool, and the dry land springs of water.</P>
<P>It is true, thou hast sinned with an high hand, both against thy light, and against my love; but how shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee, sinner? How shall I make thee as Adamah, and set thee as Ze∣boim, those rebellious cities, on which I poured my flaming vengeance? My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together; I will not destroy thee; for I am God and not man. I have seen thy ways, and will heal and lead thee, and restore com∣fort to thee; for I create the fruit of the lips, Peace! peace to him that is afar off, and to him that is near, I will heal him.</P>
<P>Thou hast not chosen me, but I have chosen thee; thou art my servant, fear not, for I am with thee; be not dismayed, for I am thy God. My strength is sufficient for thee; I
<PB N="246" REF="017930_0241_0FA37DB9C849C3E0"/>
will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. They that war against thee shall be as nothing, for I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand, and make my strength perfect in thy weakness. I will bring thee by a way thou hast not known. I will make darkness light before thee, and crooked paths strait: When thou passest thro' the waters, I will be with thee, and when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee, for I am the Lord, thy Saviour and thy God. I have carried thee from the womb, and even to hoary hairs will I bear and deli∣ver thee.</P>
<P>Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted and drunken, but not with wine: I will not con∣tend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit would fail before me, and the soul which I have made. I turn the water of affliction into the wine of consolation. Be∣hold, I take out of thy hand the cup of trem∣bling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury: thou shalt no more drink it again; I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thy soul: And in the room of it, I give thee the cup of the New Testament in my blood, shed for the remission of sins: It is now ready, draw near, drink thou of it, and taste that I am gracious.</P>
<P>Come near, that I may speak a word in sea∣son to thy weary spirit. Why standest thou afar off? Come near, I say, that my soul may bless thee. Let me shew thee my glory, and proclaim my soul-reviving name: <HI>The Lord! The Lord God! merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, and forgiving ini∣quity,
<PB N="247" REF="017930_0242_0FA37DBA89CB7240"/>
transgression, and sin!</HI> Let me wash thy heart from iniquity, guilty sinner; for, unless I wash thee, thou hast no part with me. Un∣less thou art born again of water and of the Spirit, thou canst not see the kingdom of God. But this is the covenant of promise which I make with thee: I will sprinkle clean water upon thee, and thou shalt be clean, a new heart will I give thee, and a new spirit, even my own Spirit will I put within thee, and thou shalt be compleatly born of God; and at that day thou shalt know that I am in the Father, and thou in me, and I in thee.</P>
<P>Who is he that condemneth? It is I, who died for thy sins, yea rather, who rose again for thy justification, who am even at the right hand of God, who also make intercession for thee. The same compassionate love, that made me weep over ungrateful Jerusalem, and groan over dead Lazarus, made me bleed and die for thee. O that in this thy day, thou mayst know the things that belong unto thy peace, and the efficacy of that sacrifice, by which I have for ever perfected them that are sanctified! O that unbelief, so injurious to me, and so pernicious to thee, may no longer hide my love from thine eyes!</P>
<P>What! afraid of my purity, art thou ready to cry out as my apostle, <HI>Depart from me, O Lord, for I am a sinful man?</HI> And dost thou tremble at my words as a criminal at the sen∣tence of his judge? O be of good cheer, it is I, be not afraid. Am not I thy light and strength, thy shield and buckler, thy tower and resting-place, thy strong hold whereunto thou mayst always resort, thy castle and for∣tress, the horn also of thy salvation, and thy
<PB N="248" REF="017930_0243_0FA37DBB42AAB188"/>
refuge? As for thy sins, if thou desirest to part with them, they will no more hinder me from visiting thee, than the sickness of a pa∣tient prevents a physician from giving him his attendance.</P>
<P>I know thou art a sinner—a great sinner: For this cause came I down from heaven to Bethlehem—to Gethsemane—to Calvary. I know thine iniquities are more in num∣ber than the hairs of thy head; like a sore burden, they are too heavy for thee to bear; and therefore have I borne them for thee in my own body on the tree. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance: I am the man that receiveth sinners, and eat∣eth with them: I am the friend of returning publicans and harlots; all manner of sins and blasphemies shall be forgiven them through faith in my blood: God was in me recon∣ciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them: And now, I be∣seech thee, be <HI>thou</HI> (for one) reconciled to God; for in me God is reconciled to <HI>thee,</HI> thy sin is covered, and thine iniquity forgiven.</P>
<P>Great as thy crimes are, poor mourner in Zion, I upbraid thee not with them; my in∣finitely meritorious sacrifice hath long ago atoned for their heinousness, and now I cast the mantle of my pardoning love over their multitude: Thou art ashamed of them, and shall I be ashamed of thee?—Far be the thought from thee—I glory in extending my boundless mercy to such miserable objects as thou art. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all men to be received, that I came into the world to save sinners: and if, with my servant Paul, thou seest thyself the <HI>chief</HI> of
<PB N="249" REF="017930_0244_0FA37DBC1F7BBCF8"/>
them, let me do the <HI>chief</HI> part of the errand on which I came; look unto me—partake with him of my <HI>richest</HI> salvation—lose thy cares in the bosom of my mercy—and receive the atonement I made for thee, but receive it <HI>now</HI>; for I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: Behold, <HI>now</HI> is the accepted time: Be∣hold, <HI>now</HI> is the day of salvation, the day in which I bind up the breach of my people, and heal the stroke of their wound.—</P>
<P>Whence arise, O poor sinner, thy back∣wardness and misgivings? I have ransomed thee from the power of the grave, and thou art mine: I come to heal thee, and reveal to thee the abundance of peace and truth: I bring thee a cure for thy wounded conscience, and saving health for thy sin-distempered soul!</P>
<P>In a little wrath, and for a small moment, I have hid my face from thee; but with ever∣lasting kindness will I have mercy on thee; for I am the Lord thy Redeemer. Believe it, and faith will work by love, and love will cast out fear: Thus shalt thou take hold of my strength, that thou mayst make peace with me, and thou shalt make peace with me; for I am a strength to the needy in his distress, an hiding-place from the wind, a covert from the tempest, as rivers of water in a dry place, and as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.</P>
<P>Come then, be not of them that draw back from me to perdition, but of them who be∣lieve to the saving of the soul. Far from cast∣ing away thy little confidence, which hath great recompence of reward, hold it fast; re∣sist even unto blood, striving against the damn∣ing
<PB N="250" REF="017930_0245_0FA37DBD951FA760"/>
sin of unbelief; trust in me for ever, for in me, Jehovah thy righteousness, is everlast∣ing strength; and let me no longer complain that thou (one of my oppressed people in spi∣ritual Egypt) wilt have none of me, and wilt not even come to me, that thou mightest have life more abundantly.</P>
<P>Not by works of righteousness which thou hast done, but according to my mercy I saved thee. I am the Lamb slain from the founda∣tion of the world. What my gracious pur∣pose plann'd before time, I have executed in time. My life and death have compleated the wonderful bridge, by which thou canst go over the great deep fixed between an holy God, and thy sinful soul. Concerning a main arch of this mighty work, with one of my last breaths I said, <HI>It is finished</HI>; and I now confirm the glad tidings with regard to the whole. With my right hand, and with my holy arm, I have gotten myself the vic∣tory, and parted for thee, not the waves of the red sea, but the dreadful billows of the fiery gulph. And now I return to see thee safe over. Leave only the world and sin be∣hind, and walking by faith, follow me thro' the regeneration to a throne of glory.—</P>
<P>Whence arises, sinner, this backwardness to trust in my promise, and venture after me? Dost thou suspect the sincerity of my tenders of grace? And by thinking, that I secretly except thee from my mercy, when I offer it thee openly, dost thou still make me a dis∣sembler, a liar? O wrong me not so far. I am the Truth itself: I abhor dissimulation in my creatures: And I, that say, A man should not use deceit, shall I use deceit? Shall I have
<PB N="251" REF="017930_0246_0FA37DBE39E1B020"/>
concord with Belial? Shall there be an agree∣ment between the faithful Witness, and the father of lies? Shall I sentence him, that loveth a lie, to the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, and be guilty of making one myself? Horrible to suppose! Reject the blas∣phemous thought, sinner, it wounds me in the tenderest part.</P>
<P>No, no, I do not put on a mask of pre∣tended love, to hide a rancorous, unforgiving temper: The general invitation that formerly passed my lips, is still the very language of my heart, <HI>Whosoever will, let him come and take of the water of life freely</HI>; and the promise which I formerly made, is still firmer than the pillars of heaven, <HI>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> Let these words, like incorruptible seed, beget thee again to a lively hope, and help thee to stir thyself up to lay hold on me, and my great salvation.</P>
<P>I grant <HI>that no man cometh unto me, except the Father draw him:</HI> But does he not say, I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore <HI>with loving-kindness, with the cords of a man, with bands of love have I drawn thee?</HI> Does he not draw thee even now? Who stirs thee up to repentance? Who raises in thee a desire of coming unto me by prayer? Who indulges thee at times with sweet hopes and alluring joys, to encourage thee to come? Is it not my Father, and thine, thou poor, starving prodi∣gal? And that nothing may be wanting on his part to make thee come, to drawing does he not add driving? Does he not obstruct all thy prospects of creature-happiness, and blast all thy worldly, yea, and all thy self-righte∣ous schemes? And while he touches thy heart
<PB N="252" REF="017930_0247_0FA37DBF0161F930"/>
with the rod of distress, does he not lay the scourge of affliction on thy back, and put this gracious invitation in thy hand? Away then with thy hard thoughts of my Father: He and I are a flame of eternal love: I and the Father are one.</P>
<P>Neither say thou in thy heart, This is a day of trouble, rebuke, and blasphemy; the chil∣dren are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. Shall I bring to the birth, and not give strength according to the day? Dost thou fear that my zeal, my strength, and the sounding of my bowels towards thee are restrained? Am not I Jesus still? Is my love waxed cold that it cannot pity? Is my hand shortened at all that it cannot save? Is mine ear heavy that it cannot hear? Or have I no power to deliver? Behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I clothe the heaven with blackness; and if, in the greatest storm, I say to the raging billows. <HI>Be still!</HI> There is a great calm: Fear not then, the zeal of the Lord of hosts—my zeal will do this, and more, for thy soul; yea, I will do for thee exceeding abundantly above all that thou canst ask or think.</P>
<P>I see what passes in thy heart, O thou un∣wise and slow of heart to believe, all that I and my prophets have spoken: I read thy new excuses. Thou sayst thou dost not suspect me, my faithfulness and my power; but thyself, thy helplessness, and the treachery of thy own desperately wicked heart.—What! shall this sore evil hinder thee from coming to me, who alone can remedy it? Wilt thou pray to be excused from believing, on such an account as this? O drop this last, this most
<PB N="253" REF="017930_0248_0FA37DBFBA945E50"/>
absurd plea; and walk in the steps of the faith of thy father Abraham, Rom. iv. 16. Consider not the deadness and hardness of thy heart, but the reviving, softening love of mine; not thy want of power, but my om∣nipotence; not the suggestion of Satan, but the declarations of my gospel. Wrestle not only against flesh and blood, but against the powers of internal darkness, and the spiritual wickedness of an unbelieving thought. Strive to enter in at the strait gate of faith, Against hope believe in hope, that I quicken the dead, and call the things which are not as though they were. Stagger no more at my promises through unbelief, but be strong in faith, and give glory to God, by being fully persuaded, that what I promise, I am able and willing to perform.</P>
<P>In me thou mayst find the richest and rea∣diest supply of all thy wants: I am both the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the living: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; and he that liveth and believeth in me, shall never die. Believe then, and thou shalt not come into condemnation—Believe, and thou shalt re∣ceive power; thou shalt see the glory of God; thou shalt be established; yea, and sealed with the holy Spirit of promise—Believe, and thou hast everlasting life, and shalt not come into condemnation—Believe, and a grain of faith will remove mountains of guilt and un∣belief —Believe with all thy heart—All things are possible to him that believeth, and he shall inherit all promises: For to him that over∣cometh (and <HI>faith</HI> is the victory) will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and to sit with

me on my throne; as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father on his throne— <HI>Only believe</HI> then, and through faith thou shalt subdue the kingdom of darkness, work righte∣ousness, obtain promises, stop the mouth of the roaring lion, quench the violence of temptation's fire, escape the flaming point of Satan's darts, out of weakness be made strong, wax valiant in fight, turn to flight the armies of thy spiritual adversaries, and receive thy dead soul raised to life again.</P>
<P>Thou hast played with the fiery serpents, they have bitten thy heart, but I have already suck'd the worst of the mortal poison. In the perilous attempt my soul was seized with sorrow even unto death, and an unheard-of agony, attended with a bloody sweat, came upon my body. A racking cross was the bed I was stretched upon: Sharp thorns proved the pillow on which I rested my faint∣ing head. The bitterest sarcasms were my consolations; vinegar and gall my cordials; a band of bloody soldiers the cruel wretches appointed to tear open my veins; whips, nails, hammers, and a spear, the instruments allowed them to do the dreadful operation. For hours I bled under their merciless hands: And thy fearful curse, O sinner, flowed toge∣ther with my blood. In the mean time, noon-day light was turned into the gloom of night, a dire emblem of the darkness that overspread my agonizing soul: And at last, while earthquakes rocked me into the sleep of death, I gave up the ghost, with cries that astonished my bitterest enemies, and made them smite their breasts in pangs of involun∣tary
<PB N="255" REF="017930_0250_0FA37DC13A993498"/>
sympathy. Thus, to make thee partaker of my saving health, I took the shameful and painful consequences of thy mortal distemper upon me. And now, sinner, despise no more such amazing love, requite it with a believing look. Consider my wounds, till thy consci∣ence feels their wonderful effect. Behold my atoning blood, till thou canst witness it heals all thy infirmities.</P>
<P>Knowing the terrors of the Lord, I per∣suade men. Come, thou poor prisoner of hope, turn by faith to the strong hold of my protection.—Up! for God will destroy this Sodom, the wicked world where thou linger∣est —Up! for the great and terrible day of the Lord approaches.—As I live, there is but one step between thee and death, and another between death and hell.</P>
<P>Let my love even constrain thee to arise, and to follow me, that I may receive thee unto myself, and complain no longer, that, with respect to thee, I have laboured in vain, and spent my strength for nought. Surely, sinner, I deserve thy grateful love, for I have fought thy fiercest enemies. Dreadful was the battle! My flesh was torn, my blood spilt, my life lost in the obstinate combat: But I have slain the lion and the bear, I have vanquished Death and the Grave, and rescued thy poor, helpless soul: And now let thy good Shepherd rejoice over his lost sheep: Let gratitude compel thee to come into the fold of my church, and join the little flock of my faithful followers. And if thou canst not come, do but look wishfully at me, and I will lay thee on my shoulders rejoicing, and
<PB N="256" REF="017930_0251_0FA37DC1FA528AC0"/>
carry thee in triumph into the richest pastures of my grace.</P>
<P>Once more I turn supplicant: Once more I stand at the door and knock—Saul! Saul! It is hard for thee to kick against the sharp goads of my love—Martha! Martha! one thing is needful, Chuse the good part, chuse me—O Absalom, my son! my son! Give me thy heart; I have died for thee, do not crucify me afresh—Lay down the spear of unbelief, and thine is my grace, my glory, my kingdom, the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P>Be not afraid to surrender; rebellious as thou art, I love thee still—Can a woman for∣get her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, she may forget, yet will I not forget thee. If thou wilt not take my word, believe my oath: Because I can swear by no greater, I swear by myself: <HI>As I live, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked,</HI> but that the wicked turn from his way and live: Turn then, turn unto me, for I have redeemed thee: I have cast all thy sins into the depth of the sea, and will subdue all thy iniquities.</P>
<P>And if thou canst not believe my oath, cre∣dit these scars—See! I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands. Long, too long have I waited for thy return, thou poor, wandering, weary prodigal. Let me see in thee the travel of my soul, and be satisfied. By the mystery of my holy incarnation and dreadful temptation, by my agony and bloody sweat, by my infamous death and glorious resurrection, I beseech thee, come to the par∣doning God by me. If thou hast nothing
<PB N="257" REF="017930_0252_0FA37DC2BB5F91D8"/>
to pay, I forgive thee all the debt: Whether it be fifty or five hundred pence, or ten thou∣sand talents, I frankly forgive thee all. Only let me heal thy backslidings, and love thee freely; let my left hand be under thy head, and let my right hand embrace thee. See the wounds which I have received for thee in the house of my friends! Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side, and be not faithless, but believing. Cleave to me with full purpose of heart, follow me through the regeneration, and thou shalt not only be one of my jewels, but a crown of glory, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God: Yea, as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so will I rejoice over thee, and give thee a name better than that of Son and Daughter—I, the Holy One of Israel, will be thy life and glory—I, thy Maker, will be thy husband, and thy all.</P></Q>
<P>And are these, O sinner, the gracious sayings of God to thee?—The compassionate expostu∣lations of God, become incarnate for thee?— Did God so love thee, as to set forth his only begotten Son, as a propitiation through faith in his blood, thus to declare his righteousness, for the remission of sins that are past? May the Almighty now be just, and yet the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus? Is there no differ∣ence, no respect of persons with him? And is the same Lord over all, rich unto all that call upon him? Then shout, ye heavens! Triumph, thou earth! And thou, happy sinner, know the day of thy visitation, be wise, ponder these
<PB N="258" REF="017930_0253_0FA37DC37A4F2790"/>
things, and thou shalt understand the loving-kindness of the Lord.</P>
<P>Be no longer afraid, that it will be presump∣tion in thee to believe, and that God will be offended with thee, if thou makest so free with Jesus, as to wash instantly in the fountain of his atoning blood. He not only gives thee LEAVE to believe, but he INVITES thee to <HI>do it freely.</HI> Nay, he COMMANDS thee to believe, for <HI>This is his</HI> COMMANDMENT, <HI>that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ.</HI> He even enforces the precept by a double PROMISE, that if thou believest, thou <HI>shalt not perish, but have everlasting life.</HI> And that nothing may be wanting to stir thee up to this important busi∣ness, he is gracious enough to threaten the ne∣glect of it with the most dreadful PUNISHMENT; for <HI>he that believeth not, shall not enter into his rest,</HI> and <HI>shall be damned</HI>; and that he that to the end remains <HI>fearful and unbelieving, shall be cast into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.</HI> How canst thou doubt then, whether thou art welcome to receive <HI>the Son given,</HI> by believing on his name?</P>
<P>Come to him just as thou art, and he will make thee what thou shouldst be. When he counsels thee to buy of him the gold of faith, and the garment of salvation, take him at his gospel word: Come without regarding thy stuff: The poorer thou art, the better: The oil of his grace flows most abundantly into empty vessels: His charity is most glorified in the relief of the most miserable objects: His royal bounty scorns the vile compensation of thy wretched merits: He sells like a king, like the King of kings, without money and without
<PB N="259" REF="017930_0254_0FA37DC44202E098"/>
price. <HI>Ask and have,</HI> and <HI>Take freely,</HI> are the encouraging mottos written upon all the un∣searchable treasures of his grace.</P>
<P>Be of good comfort then, rise, he calleth thee: Stretch out thy withered hand, and he will restore it: Open thy mouth wide, and he will fill it: Bring an empty vessel, a poor, hungry heart, and he will give into thy bosom good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over.</P>
<P>And now what meanest thou, sleeper? Why tarriest thou? Arise, and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord. Lose not time in conferring with flesh and blood; much less in parleying with Satan, or consulting thy un∣believing heart: Here delays lead to ruin: The Philistines are upon thee, instantly shake thy∣self: If thou art not altogether blinded by the god of this world, and led captive by him at his will; this moment, in the powerful name of JESUS, burst the bonds of spiritual sloth—break, like a desperate soul, out of the prison of unbe∣lief —escape for thy life—look not behind thee—stay not in all the plain.—This one thing do; leaving the things that are behind, Sodom and her ways, press forwards towards Zoar, and escape to the mount of God, lest thou be consumed. By the new and living way consecrated for us, in full assurance of faith, fly to the Father of mercies—pass through the croud of Laodicean professors—press through the opening door of hope—take the kingdom of heaven by violence.</P>
<P>With halting, yet wrestling Jacob, say to the Friend of sinners, <HI>I will not let thee go unless thou bless me.</HI> If he makes as if he would go farther;
<PB N="260" REF="017930_0255_0FA37DC4FA5355E0"/>
with the two mournful disciples, <HI>constrain him to stay</HI>; or rather with the distressed woman of Canaan, <HI>follow him whithersoever he goeth</HI>—take no denial—through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, torn from the crown of his head to the sole of his feet—through this mysterious veil, rent from the top to the bottom, rush into the blood-besprinkled sanctuary—embrace the horns of the golden altar—lay all thy guilt on the head of the sin-atoning victim—read thy name on the breast of thy merciful high-priest— claim the safety, demand the blessings, receive the consolations bestowed on all that fly to him for refuge—and begin a new, delightful life, under the healing and peaceful shadow of his wings.</P>
<P>But perhaps thou art now devoid of active power, and broken in spirit. The hurry of thy self-righteous nature subsides. Wounded and half dead, thou liest in the way of misery, wait∣ing for the passing by of thy heavenly Deliverer. Thou hadst set thy heart upon being blessed in one particular manner, and God in his wisdom thinks it best to bless thee in another. Thou wouldst scale the new Jerusalem and storm hea∣ven; but he chuses it should come down into thy soul as a fruitful shower descends into a fleece of wool. Be still then, and know that he is God. Let him break thy self-will, which hides itself under godly appearances; and let him practically teach thee, that salvation is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth; but of God who sheweth mercy.</P>
<P>Meekly dive into the amazing depth of these words, <HI>In quietness and rest shall be your strength. Stand still and see the salvation of God.</HI> The fire,
<PB N="261" REF="017930_0256_0FA37DC5B8C562E0"/>
the earthquake, and the rending of the rocks are over; silence takes place; the still, small voice will soon follow. Thou art for a time taken from the foaming billows of self agitation, and led by the still waters; a calm succeeds the impetuous storm, and a passive waiting thy rest∣less, fruitless endeavours. Thou art in the case of one fallen into the sea, who having struggled long and hard to escape drowning, is obliged to yield at last. Yield then, weary sinner, yield to thy happy fate. Fully surrender to the God of thy life. Entirely abandon thyself to Jesus. Freely trust him with thy present and eternal salvation. Whether thou swim or sink, let thy∣self go into the ocean of mercy. Catch at no broken reed by the way, but calmly venture into the unfathomable depths of redeeming love. Lose thus thy life, and thou shalt find it. The <HI>power</HI> of God will soon be <HI>made perfect in thy weakness</HI>; and when thy strength is renewed, earnestly wrestle again. Thus go on, alter∣nately striving and waiting, according to the leadings of the Holy Spirit, till, having passed through all the interior dispensations of divine grace, thou enter by faith into the rest that re∣mains for the people of God, and take possession of that kingdom of God, which consists in righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</P>

In that kingdom, happy believer, the times of refreshing fully come from the presence of the Lord; mercy and love embrace thee on every side; and thy sprinkled conscience enjoys the peace of a sin-pardoning God.—Then smiling Justice, more than satisfied by the me∣ritorious death of Christ, sheathes her flaming

sword, and declares, <HI>There is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus: They are justified from all things, and freely forgiven all trespasses.</HI>— And now thou art more than conqueror through him that loved thee. Standing by humble faith in his omnipotence, thou canst do all things, through his grace strengthening thee. Sin has no dominion over thee: The cruel and bloody tyrant, that reigned unto death, is dethroned; and grace, rich grace, sweetly reigns through righteousness unto eternal life. Triumphing in Christ over thy fiercest enemies, and putting thy victorious foot upon the neck of the <HI>last,</HI> thou challengest his utmost rage, and shoutest,
<Q>O Death, where is thy sting? O Grave, where is thy victory? Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ!</Q></P>
<P>Now thou seest and feelest that God is LOVE. Thou dwellest in Him, and He in thee. <HI>Love,</HI> the fulfilling of the law, diffusing itself through all thy heart, influences thy looks, words, and actions, and makes thee spring after Jesus in the chariot of cheerful obedience: Thy heart is as his heart; and while active grace draws thy willing soul along, God's free Spirit pours the oil of gladness upon the servid wheels of thy affections: Supported, and animated by the Lord's presence, thou swiftly movest, thou de∣lightfully fliest in all the ways of duty: Mount∣ains of difficulties sink into plains before thee; wisdom's roughest ways are ways of pleasant∣ness, and all her paths are peace.</P>
<P>Now thou rejoicest to be thought worthy to suffer shame for Christ's name, and countest it all joy, when thou fallest into divers trials. With him the cross loses its dreadful aspect and

enormous weight: When thou findest it in the highway of holiness, instead of consulting with flesh and blood, how thou shalt go aside to avoid it, thou immediately takest it up, and it proves a comforting staff, a never-failing prop.</P>
<P>Christ crucified works this miracle of grace, for Him thou receivest with every cross; and the moment thou dost so in the power of his Spirit, God, even thy own God, gives thee his choicest blessing: He crowns thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies; and with the in∣expressible complacence of a Father, who re∣ceives a lost son; with the triumphant joy of a Saviour, who embraces a raised Lazarus; He says to the myriads that surround his throne:
<Q>One more sinner repenteth unto life! Hallelu∣jah! He hath escaped the avenger of blood— he hath passed the gate of the city of refuge! Hallelujah! Shout, ye sons of the morning! My angels, strike your golden harps! Dance every heart for joy, through the realms of heaven! Let bursts of triumphant mirth— let peals of ravishing praise roll along the transporting news.—Let all your exulting breasts reverberate, let all your harmonious tongues echo back our glorious joy! For this my son was dead, and is alive again! This your brother was lost, and is found!</Q></P>
<P>And irradiating thy soul with the light of his reconciled countenance, he says to <HI>thee</HI> from a throne blazing with grace and glory,
<Q>Peni∣tent believer, receive the adoption of a son. Because thou receivest my Son, my only be∣gotten Son into thy heart, I admit thee into the family of the first-born: Be thou blame∣less and harmless, a son of God without re∣buke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse

generation, among whom I allow thee to shine, as a burning light in a benighted world. Son! all that I have is thine, be ever with me, and thou shalt inherit all things. Yes, whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas; whether my first apostles, or my choice mini∣sters; or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all is thine, for thou art Christ's, and Christ is mine. As thou hast received him, so abide and walk in him, worthy of me unto all pleasing; being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in his knowledge, till thy faith is turned to sight, and I am all in all.</Q></P>
<P>Start not, believing reader, at these sayings, as if they were too glorious to be credited. They are the true sayings of God. The Lord himself spoke them for thy comfort. They are the precious pearls, which I promised thee out of the unsearchable treasures of Christ: If swine trample them under their feet, wear thou them on thy breast. Instead of being offended at their transcendent excellence, magnify the God of all consolation, who, having <HI>delivered up his own Son for us all, with him also freely gives us all things,</HI> consequently the richest mines of gospel grace. And giving vent to the just transports of thy grateful heart, cry out with the beloved disciple, <HI>Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that</HI> WE <HI>should be called the sons of God!—Unto Him who</HI> thus <HI>loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.</HI> Amen.</P>

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX,</HI> Concerning the evangelical harmony that subsists be∣tween living faith and loving obedience.</HEAD>
<P>THE mystery of our salvation is thus opened by St. Paul, <HI>By</HI> GRACE <HI>are ye saved, through faith, which</HI> WORKETH <HI>by love.</HI> This apostolic declaration subdivides itself into the following propositions, which, on account of their clearness and importance, may, with propriety, be called GOSPEL AXIOMS. 1. <HI>Ye are saved by</HI> GRACE. 2. <HI>Ye are saved through a faith which</HI> WORKS <HI>by love.</HI> These proposi∣tions, like two adamantine pillars, support the whole doctrine of Christ, concerning <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>works; grace</HI> and <HI>rewardableness</HI>; or <HI>mercy</HI> on God's part, and <HI>obedience</HI> on our own:—A doctrine, which, though clear as the day, has nevertheless been so obscured by endless contro∣versies, that thousands of Protestants and Papists know it in its purity no more.</P>
<P>According to the <HI>first</HI> of these axioms, all that go to heaven, give divine <HI>grace</HI> the glory of their salvation; because they are all saved by mere favour, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ. And according to the <HI>second</HI>
<PB N="266" REF="017930_0261_0FA37DC99B642D30"/>
axiom, all that go to hell, are obliged to clear divine <HI>justice,</HI> because they are condemned merely for their avoidable unbelief, and obstinate dis∣obedience. Upon this evangelical plan, the righteous are <HI>graciously</HI> rewarded, and the un∣righteous <HI>justly</HI> punished: The doctrines of God's <HI>mercy,</HI> in giving grace for Christ's sake, and of man's <HI>faithfulness</HI> in using it bv Christ's help, sweetly coincide; and from their blessed union springs the just proportion of every part of the gospel.</P>
<P>These axioms are so strongly maintained, and so frequently alluded to by the sacred writers, that whoever rejects either the one or the other, might as well reject one half of the bible. At∣tentively consider them asunder, and your un∣prejudiced reason will perceive their <HI>equity.</HI> Im∣partially compare them together, and instead of finding them incompatible, (as some prepos∣sessed persons would persuade us they are) you will see, that they <HI>harmonize</HI> in so exquisite a manner, as to answer the most excellent ends in the world.</P>
<P>To give you an idea of their working in the breast of believers, permit me to compare them to those two opposite, and yet consentaneous motions of the heart, which anatomists call <HI>diastole</HI> and <HI>systole.</HI> The one forcibly dilates, the other powerfully contracts, that noble part of the human body; and both together, by means seemingly contrary, cause the circulation of the blood, and diffuse vital powers through all the animal frame. —Just so passive <HI>faith,</HI> and active <HI>love.</HI>—The one perpetually <HI>receives</HI> favours from God, the other perpetually <HI>bestows</HI> them upon man; and thus, by continually performing their
<PB N="267" REF="017930_0262_0FA37DCADC755EB0"/>
contrary (not contradictory) offices, they make spiritual life circulate through the believer's soul, and enable him to diffuse kindness and good works throughout the social body, of which he is a member.</P>
<P>From the animal, pass we to the planetary world; and we shall see another striking em∣blem of the harmonious opposition, which sub∣sists between the two gospel axioms. There we eminently discover the <HI>centripetal</HI> and the <HI>centrifugal</HI> force. Though opposed to each other, they are nevertheless so admirably joined together, that from their exquisite combination, results the harmonious dance of the spheres; I mean, the circular motion of the planets around the sun, and around each other.—Such is the wonderful effect of <HI>evangelical promises,</HI> and <HI>legal precepts,</HI> when they meet in a due pro∣portion in an upright heart. The <HI>promises,</HI> which are all wrapped up in the <HI>first</HI> gospel axiom, powerfully <HI>draw</HI> believers to Christ, who is the Sun of Righteousness, and the cen∣ter of the Christian system: The <HI>precepts,</HI> which the <HI>second</HI> axiom necessarily supposes, drive them forward in the strait line of duty. Being thus delightfully attracted, and powerfully impelled, like planets of a different magnitude, in the fir∣mament of the church, believers rapidly move in the orb of evangelical obedience, where the <HI>original</HI> light of Christ warmly shines into their own souls, and their <HI>borrowed</HI> light mildly gleams upon their fellow-mortals.</P>
<P>If ever you saw a person, thus swiftly and evenly moving in the immense circle of reli∣gious and social duty; freely receiving all from his God, and freely imparting all to his neigh∣bour;
<PB N="268" REF="017930_0263_0FA37DCAFAA57168"/>
you have seen one of the <HI>stars in the Lord's right hand</HI>—you have seen one, who prac∣tically holds the two gospel axioms—one, who <HI>believes</HI> as a sinner, and <HI>works</HI> as a believer—one, in whose heart the doctrines of <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>works, free grace</HI> and <HI>free obedience, divine faithfulness</HI> and <HI>human fidelity,</HI> are justly balanced—one, who keeps at an equal distance from the dreadful rocks, upon which <HI>Antinomian believers,</HI> and <HI>An∣ti-christian workers,</HI> are daily cast away—In a word, you have seen an adult Christian, a man who <HI>adorns the doctrine of Christ our Sa∣viour in</HI> ALL <HI>things.</HI></P>
<P>If the two gospel axioms are of such im∣portance, that the health and vigour of every Christian, flow from the proper union of their power in his heart; is it not deplorable to see so many people every where rising against them? <HI>Self-conceited moralists</HI> violently attack the <HI>first</HI> axiom; and <HI>self-humbled solifidians</HI> will give the <HI>second</HI> no quarter. Those opposed assailants have all, I grant, a zeal for God, but not ac∣cording to knowledge; for the <HI>former</HI> know not, that they rob God of <HI>his glory</HI>; and the <HI>latter</HI> do not consider, that they pour upon him <HI>our shame.</HI> The <HI>one</HI> refuse to acknowledge him the <HI>grand author</HI> of our <HI>bliss:</HI> The <HI>other,</HI> to mend the matter, represent him as the <HI>grand contriver</HI> of our <HI>ruin.</HI> Both, nevertheless, have truth on their side; but alas! it is only <HI>a part</HI> of the truth as it is in Jesus; and truth divided, like an animal cut through the middle, is dread∣fully mangled, if not entirely destroyed.</P>
<P>You are also desired to observe, judicious reader, that as a just proportion of sail and bal∣last, next to a favourable wind, makes a ship
<PB N="269" REF="017930_0264_0FA37DCBBAE23418"/>
sail with speed and safety; so the just balance of the two gospel axioms, next to the Spirit of God, makes a believer run swiftly and safely the race that is set before him. He does not properly <HI>run,</HI> he merely <HI>hops</HI> in the way of truth, who, discarding one of the gospel axioms, moves only upon the other. <HI>Antinomian Laodiceans</HI> there∣fore, and <HI>Anti-christian Pharisees,</HI> are equally blameable. For the piety of the <HI>former</HI> stands only upon the <HI>first</HI> axiom; and the devotion of the <HI>latter</HI> has no other basis than the <HI>second.</HI> The <HI>one</HI> will hear of nothing but faith; the <HI>other</HI> will be told of nothing but <HI>works.</HI> But the <HI>sound</HI> believer is for a <HI>faith</HI> that <HI>works</HI> righteousness.</P>
<P><HI>Faith unfeigned,</HI> and <HI>obedient love,</HI> are of equal importance to the true Christian. Those pre∣cious graces, which answer to the gospel axioms, like a well proportioned pair of heavenly steeds, mutually draw the steady chariot of his pro∣fession across the valleys of discouragement, and over the hills of difficulty, which he meets with in his way to heaven. If I might carry on the allegory, I would observe, that all the advan∣tage, which the right hand steed has over the other, is, that it is <HI>first</HI> put in the traces: But this is no proof of his superiority, for he will be taken off at the gate of heaven; and <HI>obedient love</HI> alone, shall have the honour of drawing the Christian's triumphal car through the realms of glory.</P>
<P>Reader, if in the theory and practice you maintain both gospel axioms; if, instead of setting up the one in opposition to the other, you stand upon the scriptural line in which they harmonize; you have surmounted the greatest
<PB N="270" REF="017930_0265_0FA37DCC8409D428"/>
difficulty there is in the Christian religion; you hold <HI>the faith once delivered unto the saints.</HI> And now, prepare to <HI>contend for it:</HI> Arm your∣self for the fight; for <HI>Antinomian believers</HI> will attack you on the <HI>left</HI> hand, and <HI>Pharisaic un∣believers</HI> on the <HI>right.</HI> But be not afraid of their number; patiently receive their double fire. They may gall one <HI>another,</HI> but they cannot hurt <HI>you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Truth</HI> is great, and <HI>Love</HI> powerful; if you fight under their glorious banners, tho' the ar∣rows of contempt, and the brands of calumny, will fly thick around you, you shall not be dan∣gerously wounded. Only <HI>take the shield of faith,</HI> with this motto, '<HI>By grace I am saved through faith</HI>; and <HI>quench with it the fiery darts</HI> of self-conceited legalists. <HI>Put on the breast-plate of righteousness,</HI> with this inscription,
<Q>Faith works by righteous love, the mother of good works:</Q>
This piece of celestial armour, will keep off the heaviest strokes of <HI>self-humbled gospellers.</HI> And animated by the Captain of your salvation, through the opposite forces of those adversaries, urge your evangellically-legal way, till you ex∣change <HI>the sword of the Spirit</HI> for a <HI>golden harp,</HI> and your daily cross for an heavenly crown.</P>
<P>Such is the happy medium, that the author of this book desires to recommend. Some time ago, he thought himself obliged to oppose good mistaken men, who, in their zeal for the <HI>first</HI> gospel axiom, wanted to represent the <HI>second</HI> as a 'dreadful heresy.' And now he lets these papers see the light, not only to prove to the free thinkers of his parish, that the <HI>first</HI> axiom is highly rational; but to convince the enemies of the <HI>second</HI> axiom, that, though he has exposed
<PB N="271" REF="017930_0266_0FA37DCD3A42A088"/>
their mistakes with regard to <HI>works,</HI> he receives the <HI>genuine</HI> doctrines of grace as cordially as they; and is ready scripturally, and rationally, to defend salvation by <HI>faith,</HI> against: the most plausible objections of self-righteous moralists.</P>
<P>He just begs leave to observe, that the pre∣ceding pages guard the <HI>first</HI> gospel axiom; that the <HI>Four Checks to Antinomianism,</HI> guard chiefly the second; that <HI>the Equal Check to Pharisaism and Antinomianism,</HI> guards both at once; and that those tracts contain a little system of prac∣tical and polemical divinity, which, it is hoped, stands at an equal distance from the errors of moral disbelievers, and immoral believers.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> book is chiefly recommended to disbe∣lieving moralists, who deride the doctrine of salvation by grace <HI>through faith</HI> in the day of conversion, merely because they are not properly acquainted with our fallen and lost estate. And the <HI>Checks</HI> are chiefly designed for disbelieving Antinomians, who rise against the doctrine of a believer's salvation by grace <HI>through</HI> the <HI>works</HI> of faith in the great day, merely because they do not consider the indispensable necessity of evan∣gelical obedience, and the nature of the day of judgment.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Appeal,</HI> the careless, self-conceited sin∣ner is awakened, and humbled. In the <HI>Address,</HI> the serious, humbled sinner, is raised up, and comforted. And in the <HI>Checks,</HI> the foolish vir∣gin is re-awakened, the Laodicean believer re∣proved, the prodigal son lashed back to his Fa∣ther's house, and the upright believer animated to mend his pace in the way of <HI>faith working by love,</HI> and to <HI>perfect holiness in the fear of God.</HI></P>
