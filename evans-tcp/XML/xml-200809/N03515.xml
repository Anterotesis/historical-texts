<HEAD>THE <HI>PREFACE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Readers,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE worthy Author of the ensu∣ing excellent Discourse, putting it into the Hand of a young Man, who desired Leave that it might be made publick, for the Benefit of all his Brethren, that would read it, the pious Author consented unto the pub∣lishing of it, if I would usher it into the World with a prefatory Line, to
<PB N="2" REF="004293_0003_10040E0BCC06EB20"/>
excite People to improve it, which I readily do; earnestly desiring, that all our sea faring Friends, and all Others that see this Treatise, might be per∣swaded immediately, to make sure, a∣bout giving themselves unto the glo∣rious Redeemer, according to his holy Covenant of Grace, and strive conti∣nually to live, as becomes them that are given to the Lord, by the Grace of Christ, praying without ceasing, for Grace, to sail apace forward unto the Haven of eternal Blessedness.</P>
<P>And, my Friends, be thoroughly awa∣kened, to consider about the Affairs of your precious immortal Souls. Be not like them that sleep as on the Top of a Mast in the midst of the Sea, al∣ways ready to roll off and drop down into everlasting Burnings, but keep in Mind the awful Demand of our Saviour, <HI>What is a Man profitted if he shall gain the whole World and lose his own Soul.</HI> Frequently and solemnly renew the Dedication of your selves unto the Lord, and often examine how Things are between God and your own Souls, and pray always with all Prayer, both
<PB N="3" REF="004293_0004_10040E1388F810F8"/>
in secret alone, and in private with your Company, Day and Night, and read in the holy Bible every Day. And omit no Duty until God send a Storm, to excite you to it. Keep al∣ways in the Love and Fear of God; and realize to your selves, that the Lord sees you every where. Be not sa∣tisfied without being assured, that you are where God would have you to be. Remember all the Rules on all the Points of the renowned <HI>Fla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>'s Com∣pass, and strive daily to be advancing in your Course towards the heavenly Haven. But be sure to rely on the glorious Redeemer, for the Influences of his holy Spirit, for the carrying of you forward. And, that you may do so, seriously and frequently peruse the savory Advice in the following Dis∣course, that has been composed and published with an earnest Desire of your eternal Benefit. Read it over and over, and strive to practice it daily better and better; and be assured the glorious Lord knows how you improve it, and will reckon with you for it, as a choice Talent, that he hath be∣trusted you with. O strive to be able to give a good Account about your
<PB N="4" REF="004293_0005_10040E15130DB750"/>
benefiting by it. Our seafaring People are some of the most serviceable of our Neighbours; and we should be concer∣ned for their best Good. Who more than Sailors and Soldiers, do carry their Lives in their Hands? Therefore they need the Prayers, the Cares, the Helps, and the best Endeavours of all their Friends for their Good. They are destitute of many Advantages that Others do enjoy: They are sometimes a long While without the publick Worship of God. And 0 that <HI>Private,</HI> and <HI>Secret,</HI> and <HI>Sabbath Religion</HI> were more minded than I can learn, they generally are, among our seafaring Friends; that they may have more Ground, than I fear they have, to hope to enjoy the gracious Presence of God with them.</P>
<P>And I wish that those young Men that might live at Home comfortably would consider seriously, whether the Enemy of their Souls may not be driving them, when they are mightily hurried, to run away to Sea. Does
<PB N="5" REF="004293_0006_10040E180E15F118"/>
not their Enemy drive them to Sea, that he may more easily drive them to Hell? But as for them that must go to Sea, I wish they would all follow the Counsels in the following Treatise, and make sure that they have the gracious and favourable Presence of God with them. and let them always remember that awful Advice and Warning in 2 Chr. 15. 2. <HI>The Lord is with you, while you be with him;If ye seek him he will be found of you, if ye forsake him he will forsake you.</HI></P>
<P>But now, may the best of Blessings be on the Souls of all our seafaring Tribe, and on him, that first desired the Publication of this beneficial Dis∣course, and on all that assisted the Publication and on all the serious Readers of it. And may the godly Author be blessed in his Person, his Family, and his Flock: And may he still more and more be a rich Blessing, not only unto those, over whom the Holy Ghost hath made him an Overseer, but also unto many more of the Chosen of
<PB N="6" REF="004293_0007_10040E19B63142B0"/>
God. And may he finish his Course with Joy, and help abundance of Souls into everlasting Joy. So wishes the unworthiest of Sinners.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>INstead of a small Venture, I pro∣posed to have lent by you, for my own temporal Advantage; I re∣commend to you and your Company, the following Papers; as a small Pre∣sent for your spiritual Profit. They contain in them, the Substance of two Sermons, delivered the last Lord's Day, in which (you can't but be sensible) I had a special Regard to you, and hazardous Enterprize you are pur∣suing,
<PB REF="004293_0009_10040E1B4A0D49B8"/>
upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> The Argument insisted upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exceeding weighty, and incomparably precious. And tho' it is but very meanly handled, yet if you read the following Essay, with suitable Dispositions of Piety, you may meet with such Hints, as(by the Bles∣sing of God) may be of greater and more lasting Service to you, than the Riches of both Indies. They will be really so, if hereby you are effectu∣ally perswaded to comply with the gospel Terms of Reconciliation: Upon which, you may be well assured of the divine Presence and Favour in all your Ways. Yea, God himself will be your Portion, Shield, and exceed∣ing great Reward. And then nothing shall be wanting that is good for you, for God is all in all. Are you weak? He is Strength. Poor? He is Riches. In Trouble? He is Comfort. Sick? He is Health. Dying? He is Life. Have you nothing? He is all Things. Whatsoever is suitable to your Nature, or convenient for you in every Condi∣tion of Life, that God is. Whatsoe∣ver is great, or pleasant, good, or need∣ful to make Men happy, that God is. <HI>Summum ac universale Bonum.</HI> An im∣mense and universal Good.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="004293_0010_10040E24485BBD70"/>But tho' the tender Mercies of God are over all his Works; and the vilest of Men, in this World, are refreshed with the common Fruits of the divine Benignity; yet the Good, which I would here recommend to you, is no common Thing. God, it's true, as to his Essence, is ubiquitary; and his Providence is e∣qually extensive with his Works of Cre∣ation. Matth. 5. 45. <HI>He maketh his sun to rise on the Evil and on the Good, and sen∣deth Rain on the Just and on the Unjust.</HI> But it is only some Men, and some Angels that he is present with in a Way of spe∣cial Grace and Favour. This is that great, that comprehensive, and inestimable Good which I would plead with you to seek af∣ter, above all Things whatsoever. With it you can't be miserable, and without it you can't be happy. It is certainly a Pearl of great Price: The wise Merchant will readily part with all for it, This, this will steer your Course, and fill your Sails, be to you an unerring Compass, and never sailing Pilot. If therefore you love your selves, your Bodies, your Souls, your best Interests, either temporal, spiritual, or eternal. Venture not to weigh your Anchors, nor to holst your Sails, till you have Ground to believe that God will go along with
<PB N="iv" REF="004293_0011_10040C699F542FF8"/>
you. Repent therefore of all your Sins without Delay, close with the blessed Jesus, upon the Terms of the everlasting Gospel, and yeild up your Souls to the forming Hand of the blessed Spirit: That the Kingdom of God may be set up within you, even that Kingdom which is not Meat and Drink, <HI>but Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI> Rom. 14. 17. And then you need not doubt of God's gracious and spiritual Presence, for he never will for∣sake his own Palace. That you might be directed and assisted in making sure of this incomparable Good, and so your Father's God be your God, and the Guide of your Youth, is next to the Glory of my Master, the Design of the following Essay, its be∣ing put into your Hands. For this Pur∣pose therefore I recommend it to the Bles∣sing of the Father of Lights; and you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and give you an Inheritance among all them which are sanctified. And so wishing you a prospe∣rous Voyage, by the Will of God, and a safe Return. I remain.</P>

<HEAD>The Necessity and Benifit OF THE Divne Presence,</HEAD>
<P>Considered and Improved in some Remarks upon what is written Exod. 33. 15. <HI>And he said unto him, If thy Presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</HI></P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>OSES, an eminent Servant of God, renowned to all Posterity, having God's Call, notwithstanding many and mighty Discouragments pur∣sued that arduous and difficult Charge of conducting the untractable Seed of <HI>Jacob</HI> from <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Canaan,</HI> so far as to bring them into the Wilderness of

<HI>Sinai</HI>; he was called up into the Mount of God to receive the Law at his Mouth: And his Attendance upon that awfull and important Affair was so far protracted (he being detained there Forty D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ys and Forty Nights) that the Congre∣gation of <HI>Israel</HI> began to dispair of his Return; and thereupon fell into Idola∣trous Practices, which so incensed the Anger of God against them, that he withdrew his Presence from them, and refused to go along with them, as he had promised.</P>
<P>MOSES upon his Return, finding his Charge under such gloomy Circumstances not only expresses a just Indig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> against their horrid and provoking Impieties, but in his Address to G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d pleads their Cause with an agonizing Importunity, as you may ohserve to∣wards the Close of the 32. Chap.</P>
<P>And in our Context, on his own Be∣half, having a very weighty Charge upon him, pleads with God for Guidence and Direction, with the Addition of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Special Token of his divine Favour, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> God says to him vers. 14. <HI>My Presence shall go with thee, and I

will give thee Rest.</HI> A great, precious, and comprehensive Promise, surely! hap∣py is that Man who is in such a Case; yet, blessed is that People whose God is the LORD.</P>
<P>MOSES, the Captain General and Governour in Chief, of the Congrega∣tion of <HI>Israel,</HI> was (no doubt) sensible of the vast Consequence of the Divine Presence with a Person or People in the common Concerns of Life, much more in Enterprizes peculiarly hazard∣ous, such as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that of their passing thro' an howling Wilderness, and taking possession of the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> (tho' promised) against the united Force of many and mighty Enemies. And there∣fore he makes such a Reply to God as that in the Text.</P>
<P><HI>If thy Presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</HI> q. d. <HI>O Lord, I desire, I incline I am willing to go no futher in this great Undertaking, than thy Pres∣ence goes along with me.</HI> Indeed the Words, <HI>with me,</HI> are supplied in our Translation, for they are not in the Orig∣inal; but <HI>Moses</HI> being the Commander in Cheif, had peculiar need of the Divine presence.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004293_0015_10040E3390BB8DD8"/>As the Loyalist's in <HI>Israel</HI> in the time of <HI>Absoloms</HI> Conspiracy. told King <HI>David,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 18. 3. <HI>Thou art worth Ten Thous¦and of us</HI>: He being the Head, and in some sort Heart, from which all Intellectual and Vital Insfluences flow, so it might be said of <HI>Moses,</HI> considered in his publick Capacity, he was worth an Hundred Thousand of the <HI>Israelites</HI> in the Wilderness, and by Consequence the Presence of God with him was of very great Importance, inasmuch as the Divine Presence with the governing Head of a People or Sociery of Men engaged in any hazardous Enterprize, may be as extensive and beneficial as the In∣tellectual and Vital Influences of the Head and Heart are to the Body Na∣tural. <HI>Israel,</HI> no doubt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>red much the better upon the Account ot God's Pres∣ence with his Servant <HI>Moses.</HI></P>
<P>But the main Thing aim'd at in this Essay, is not to consider the blessed Fruits of the Divine Presence in such a limited Sense, tho' the Words read would very naturaly lead me to it, but to discover, and improve upon the Im∣portance and vast Consequence of the Divine Presence with a Person or People, any
<PB N="5" REF="004293_0016_10040C6CB00B1E38"/>
Body or Society of Men, even in the most common Concerns of Life; but especially in Enterprizes, attended with any peculiar Hazard and Danger. The Engagments of which will, no doubt, be the solicitous Concern and Study of every pious and devout Soul; those especially that have the Care ot Others, as well as themselves; as <HI>Moses</HI> had of the whole Congregation of <HI>Israel</HI> in the Wilderness.</P>
<P>Wherefore, since the Words under Consideration, need no other Explanati∣on but what may be very naturally and methodically attended, in the va∣rious Parts of the ensuing Discourse. I shall without any further Remarks, proceed to a Consideration of the main and principal Thing aim'd at, which may be expressed in this</P>
<P>DOCTRINE.</P>
<P>THat, since the Presences of God in all the Concerns of Life, es∣pecially those that are attended with peculiar Hazard and Danger, is of vast Consequence to the Children of Men. It should be the solicitous Concern of
<PB N="6" REF="004293_0017_10040E38B6E5AE30"/>
all, as it is of every pious and devout' Soul, to eng ge the Presence of God with them in all their Undertakings.</P>
<P>Indeed the Case of <HI>Moses</HI> in our Text and Contex was extraordinary; he had therefore the greater Reason to be solicitously concerned in engaging the Divine Presence and Favour with him∣self and People. Nevertheless, since the Presence md Favour of God, and that only, can make every Circumstance of Life pleasant and profitable and fill our Sails with the refreshing Gales of Prosperity, in those various Enerprises wherein we embarque in this present World of mutability, therefore both Dury and Interest, if we are not forgetfull of our God and selves, will certainly fill us with an earnest Concern for the enjoy∣ment of God's Presence in all our un∣dertakings, hightened in proportion to the Hazard and Difficulty attending those Enterprizes we are engaged in.</P>
<P>Therefore in speaking further to the Doctrine, I shall,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> Enquirealitle into the Nature and Quality of that Presence of God, which is o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such vast Consequence to the Children of Men.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="004293_0018_10040C75C905D850"/>2<HI>dly.</HI> Discover to you the Vast Cons∣equence of the Divine Presence to the Children of Men in all their Under∣takings, especially those that are at∣tended with any peculiar Hazard and Danger. And then,</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> Shew you that it should be the selicitous Concern of all, as it is of every pious and devour Soul, to engage the Presence with them in all their undertakings. Unto which over and above, some Reflections that may be made as I pass along, I shall add.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> Some Improvement, or Appli∣cation of the whole.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> Let us, a little, enquire into the Nature and Quality of that Presence of God, which is of such vast Conse∣quence to the Children of Men.</P>
<P>In order to which, without any Critical Exactness, something may be spoken.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> Of God's Essential.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Of his Providential. And,</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> Of his Gracious and Spiritual Presence,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="004293_0019_10040E41DC394010"/>1<HI>st.</HI> Something may be spoken here of God's Essential Presence, which, be∣yond dispute is Uniquitary: For he is not included in, nor excluded from any Place whatsoever, the Light of Nature affords convincing Arguments of this Truth. Hence, an <HI>Heathen Poet</HI> could say—<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouis omnia plena.</HI> The Empyreal, of highest Heavens, tho' the Presence Chamber of the Lord JEHOVAH are not a Local Limitation of his Essence, which is boundless and unlim∣meted. Will God, indeed, dwell on the Earth? Behold the Heaven and Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him. 1 <HI>King.</HI> 8.27. Much less doth he dwell in Temples made with Hands; as tho' confined to those Places where he peculiarly manifests his Presence, Grace and Favour on Earth. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 17. 24. Indeed he is not far from, but essentially present with every Creature; not only in the Heaven, but upon the Earth; yea, in the deepest Abyss of Eternity. The Royal <HI>Psalmist</HI> very Ele∣gantly discants upon this Argument. <HI>Psalm.</HI> 139 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <HI>Whether shall I go from thy Spirit? Or. Whether shall I flee from thy Pre∣sence? If I ascend up into Heaven,
<PB N="9" REF="004293_0020_10040E450A2D87A0"/>
thou art there: If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there: If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the Sea, even there shall thy Hand lead me, and thy Right, and shall hold me. If I say surely the Darkness shall cover me: Even the Night shall be right about me; yea, the Darkness bedeth not from thee; but the Night sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eth as the Day; The Darkness and the Light are both alike to thee.</HI></P>
<P>What Reason then have Sinners to tremble, and Saints to be joyful in God who is their Portion and exceed∣ing great Reward; and accordingly will he unto them a Sun to refresh, and a Shield to defend them in all Times of Difficulty and Danger, and will not withold any good Thing from them that walk uprig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly <HI>Psal.</HI> 84. 11.</P>
<P>Is God Uniquitary? What Reason then have Sinners to tremble and be filled with pressing Concern? Since there is no Darkness nor Shadow of Death where the workers of Iniquity can hide themselves! <HI>For God's Eyes are upon the Ways of Man, and be

<P>With what trembling Reflectons, then, may Sinners justly look back upon their secret Faults, as well as open Transgressions; endeavour speedily to make their Peace with God by Repent∣ance of all Sin, and Faith in his Son; conscientiously <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>triving to refrain from every Thing that is morally Evil and Dis. honourable; and to maintain a sincere Respect to all God's Commandments,

of God's Providential Presence. I am not satisfied, that t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s is equally extensive with his Essential Presence, which is nor limited by Time or Place, but eternally fills that Im∣mense void, where there is no creat∣ed Existence. Whereas the Providen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial Presence of God, tho' equally Extensive with the vast Circle of the Crea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion: Yet, as such. is confined, within, and not extended beyond those Limits: It being that divine Inspection, Care and Presidency, whereby the great Creator watches over, supports &amp; governs all second Beings, according to the Counsel of his own Will. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1. 11. Universal Nature feels the Effects of it in rhe Supports which the Almighty JEHOVAH affords to all Creatures, by which they are kept from relapsing into a State of Non-entity: And the Government which he exercises over them; by which they are led to their designed Ends: Some in one Way and some in Another. The most inconsiderable Orders of being, in the Creation, with all their Indi∣viduals, are under the Influence of God's providential Presence; none so con∣temptible, as to be pass'd over with neglect: But Angels, Men and Devils,
<PB N="15" REF="004293_0026_10040C86E236E558"/>
are in a peculiar Manner so, God having made them reasonable Creatures, capable of a moral Agency, and so placed them under the Government of a Rule, respect vely suited to their Na∣tures; and therefore will be their Rule of Judgment in the great Day;</P>
<P>Here, then it may be our pur∣pose to observe.</P>
<P>That whilst God is providentially present with some in a way of Favour, he is so with others in a way of Wrath and Displeasure. He is present with the Devils in Hell: How? In a way of Wrath and Displeasure; they are in his Chain, at his Beck and Command, under the dreadful Impres∣sons of his Anger, reserved to the Judgment of the great Day. This is likewise the Case of those damned Souls who are now in the Dark and gloomy Hades of Infernal Misery. And thus God will he eternally present with the Damned in Hell; not only to keep them in Being, by his Manu∣tenency, but to execute on them the fierceness of his Anger, holding them up with one Hand, whilst he smites
<PB N="16" REF="004293_0027_10040E5E49500880"/>
with the Other. They shall be seper∣ated from his favourable and gracious Presence, which is a Circumstanced d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣ful, beyond Expression: For in his Favour there Lite; but add to this, the dreadful Impressions of his wrath∣ful Presence, and then consider Is it not a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God? <HI>Heb.</HI> 10 31. Both these I presume may be implied in that awful Scripture. 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 1. 7, 8, 9. <HI>When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming Fire, taking Vengeance on them that knew not God and that obey not she Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlasting Destruction from the</HI> PRESENCE <HI>of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</HI></P>
<P>But to return from this D'gression, to our Earth. God is not always providentially present here, with Men, in Ways of Favour: sometims in a Way of Anger and Displeasure, by visiting them with consuming Judgments. <HI>Psal.</HI> 9. 3. <HI>When mine Enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy Presence,</HI> says David. And accordingly by a Pro∣phetick

Spirit, prays for the Des∣traction of Gods Enemies <HI>Psal.</HI> 68. 2. <HI>As Smoke is driven away, so drive them away; as Wax melteth before the Fire, so let the Wicked perish at the Presence of God.</HI> Thus the old World perished at the Presence of an angry God. Thus, <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> and those City which God overthrew in his Anger and in his Wrath, and repent∣ed not. <HI>Jerem.</HI> 20. 16. Thus the <HI>Egyptians</HI> perished in the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> through the angry Presence of an Holy God, who in that Instance of Judg∣ment upon the Enemy, pleaded the Cause of his People, being present with them in a Way of Favour. And thus God is many Times present in the midst of Sinners to execute Judg∣ment upon them, even in this Lite. It would be easie to produce remark∣able Instances hereof, over and above what have been mentioned, both by Sea and Land. Indeed there is a vast Difference between <HI>Chastisements</HI> and <HI>Judgments,</HI> in the Principle from whence they flow, and Design upon which they are sent, tho' materially consider∣ed, they may be very much alike: The Principle from whence Chastisements flow,
<PB N="18" REF="004293_0029_10040E66410BCAB0"/>
is, <HI>Divine Love</HI>: And the End for which they are sent, is the Good of the Afflicted, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12 6, 10 Tho' the same sort of Afflictions may be sent upon some as Chastisements, and upon others as Judgments and Fruits of God's Wrath; hence, that of <HI>Solomon, Eccl.</HI> 9. 1. <HI>No Man knowerh Love or Hatred, by all that is before them.</HI> So that God may be present in a Way of Grace and Mercy, with a Man, or Number of Men, when they are under afflicted Circumstances. And on the other Hand, God may be present in a way of Wrath, when he gives Sin∣ners their Desires, but in Judgment as as he did to <HI>Israel</HI> of old, <HI>Psal.</HI> 106. 15. <HI>He gave them their Request, but sent Leanness into their Soul.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, God may be said to be provi∣dentially present with a Person or a People in a way of Favour when he compas∣seth them about with outward Blessings, smiles upon, and prospers their Under∣takings in the World; so that the Blessings of Life flow in very plentiful∣ly upon them, as the Darlings, or peculiar Favourites of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>dence. This appears very desireable to our Natural
<PB N="19" REF="004293_0030_10040C9336F01258"/>
Resentments of God and Evil; but in order to make them real Blessings, one Thing further is necessary, and that is Grace and Wisdom from on High, to receive them as coming from God, with the most graceful Resent∣ments, and to improve them to his Glory, and our own everlasting Good.</P>
<P>This brings me to speak something of God's gracious and spiritual Presence. This is not common to all, but pe∣culiar to some only. Such are they who belong to God, and are redeemed and sanctified by the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ: Having set up his Kingdom within, he presides, rules and reigns in the Heart. And being Lord of Providence, orders all their Out∣ward and Temperal Affairs in a Way of Mercy. If infinite Wisdom sees that Prosperity in this World shall be best for them; That, no doubt, shall be their Portion If Adversity be neces∣sary, God will be present with such to support them under, give them a sanctified Use of Trials, and in the proper Season to deliver them out of all their Distesses.</P>

<P N="6">6. The gracious and spiritual Presence of God is necessary to enable the Children of Men to improve both the Smiles and Frowns of divine Pro∣vidence, to God's Glory, and their own Good. Outward Prosperity, how∣ever pleasing it may be to the Flesh, instead of being rally serviceable, is very hurtful to the Soul. <HI>Solomon</HI> speaks of the Prosperity of Fools, which will destroy them, <HI>Prov.</HI> 1. 32. Without the the Influences of divine Grace, Prosperity will make us forget God, and walk unsteadily with him: Yea, deny him, <HI>Prov</HI> 30 9. And <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eshurun</HI> like, kick with He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls of Rebellion against him, evilly requiting the Lord for all his Goodness; but thro' the kind Influence of his gracious and

Spiritual Presence, the Riches of his Goodness will lead us to Repentance, and make us abundantly fruitful in good Works, Gncerly endeavouring to walk, in some Measure, answerable to our Receipts of divine Kindness. This is the Language of an Heart warmed with those divine Influences; under the outward Smiles of a kind Provi∣dence. <HI>Psal.</HI> 116. 12. <HI>What shall I render unto the Lord, for all his Benefits towards me.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Hand, as to the Frowns of divine Providence, unless sanctified they will disturb our Peace, imbitter our Spirits, and fill us with Discon∣tent, which will very much unfit us for the Services and Sufferings of this present Time, put us out of the Pos∣sesson of our own Souls, and render us uncapable of enjoying our God, the most desireable Object that the Soul of Man can converse with, or be brought to the Fruition of; infinitely fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l being possessed of all possible Perfection, Excellency and Glory. Whereas, if the Frowning Providences of our Almighty Sovereign be sanctified to us, by the Influences of God's gracious Presence,
<PB N="34" REF="004293_0045_10040E9E3A713A38"/>
which is to be expectd in no other Way: Our most grievious Troubles here shall, in fine, contribute to our Spiritual Comfort, and our greatest Los∣ses to our best and most lasting Gain. In a Word, by the kind and benign Influences of God's gracious and Spi∣ritual Presence here, we shall be brought through the various Scene of change∣able Time, into a permanent Eternity of immutable Bliss, in the immediate Presenc of Divine Glory; where there is a Fullness of Joy, and Pleasures for ever more, <HI>Psalm.</HI> 16. 11.</P>
<P>Thus, under sundry particular Heads, I've endeavoured to discover to you the vast Consequence of the Divine Presence with the Children Men in all their Undertakings, especially those that are attended with any peculiar Hazard and Danger; by showing you how necessary God's gracious and spi∣ritual Presence is, to keep Men from the Power of Temptation and Sin, to save them from the Harms and Casu∣altys they ares exposed to, in their various Ways, to direct and assist them in the Way of Duty, to succeed them in their Undertakings, to support them under frowning Providences, and to
<PB N="35" REF="004293_0046_10040EA21BA58B90"/>
enable them to improve both the Smiles and Frowns of divine Providence, to God's Glory and their own Spiritual, and Everlasting good.</P>
<P>What has been said under these Heads, will, I think, very naturally lead as to a Consideration of these Two De∣ductions, or Inferences.</P>
<P N="1">1. That nothing can make a Man, or Society of Men, miserable so long as they enjoy the gracious and favourable Presence of Almighty God. Unto such God will be a Sun and a Shield he will give them Grace, and Glory too, and no good Thing will he withold from them that walk uprightly. If God be with you, neither the Rage of Men, or Malice of Devils shall ever blast or ruin you, or any other Evil prove finally fatal to you, What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Winds blow, the Waters rear, the Seas rage, and all seems to be in Confusion round about you? Yet, <HI>Fear not, for I am with thee, faith the Lord: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not dismayed, for I am thy God,</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a. 41. 10.</P>
<P>What, though you fall into the Hands of merciless Enemies, more cruel than the Lion, Tyger or Bear? Or are foun∣dered and overwhelmed in the fathom∣less
<PB N="36" REF="004293_0047_10040EA645BD0E20"/>
Deeps, constrained to take up your Lodging in those watery Regions, enwrapp'd about with the marine Weeds of the troubled Ocean. through the long and darksome Night of Death? Yet if God be with you, none of these Calamities shall mar your Felicity, if you are under the kind Influences of sanctifying and saving Grace, and are, indeed, the Subject of a Christ liv∣ing within, as the Hope of Glory, your Enemies may abuse, torment and murder your Bodys, but they cannot hurt your Soul, which as to their Rage are impenetra'le and impossable. Your Souls likewise, may be seperated from your Bodys by the suffocating Thick∣ness of the watery Element into which you are inevitably plunged; but if in Christ which is your Security of the divine Presence) they shall by guardian Angels, be conducted into the joyful Presence of God that gave them; And your Bodys during their Term of In∣sensibility, in the bowels of the mov∣ing Ocean, shall be carefully kept and preserved by our great Emanuel, and in the last D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the irresistable Efficacy of their Union to Christ, be brought forth to the Resurrection of Life. The

Time is coming when the Sea shall give up the Dead which are in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Rev.</HI> 20. 13. But dear Souls!

<P><HI>I proceed to the second Inference.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Without the gracious and favourable Presence of God, nothing can make them Happy: For the Happiness of Mans Life doth not consist in the Abundance of the Things which he possesseth, or hath a Possession of. <HI>Luk.</HI> 12. 15. And therefore be your Prospects never so fair and promising, and your creature Dependancies never so great. (If God be not with you) youll either meet with some blatting Providence, God will blow upon your encouraging Enterprizes, and bring them to nought; or if out∣wardly they seem to succeed, it will turn to your greater Disadvantage; the Ruin of your Souls, <HI>For the Prosperity Fools</HI> (as Ive told you before) <HI>shall destroy them.</HI> There' y you'll be lead on to nil up the Measure of your Sins, ripened
<PB N="38" REF="004293_0049_10040EAC5DA8D1B8"/>
for Judgment, and so an holy and jeal∣ous God, in his just Displeasure, will cut you off, Root and Branch in one Day, <HI>Isai.</HI> 9. 14. <HI>Now,</HI> therefore, <HI>con∣sider this, ye than forget God, left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear you in Pieces, and there be none to deliver,</HI> Psalm. 50. 22.</P>
<P><HI>Hereupon I proceed,</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. To shew you, That it should be the Solicitous Concern of all, as it is of every pious and devout Soul, to en∣gage the Presence of God with them in all their Undertakings.</P>
<P><HI>Here it may be of Service, to de∣liberate a little upon two Points.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Engagement of God's gracious and spiritual Presence, is the solicitous Concern of every pious &amp; devout Soul, Es∣pecially in Enterprizes, that are pecu∣liarly hazardous and dangerous. The great Desire of their Souls is, not that they might make a great Figure in the World, enjoy a great Confluence of temporal Blessings, or be honoured with the Applause and vain Comple∣ments of a giddy Multitude; but that
<PB N="39" REF="004293_0050_10040EAAD13169B8"/>
they might enjoy the Presence of the eternal JEHOVAH as their sure Friend, compassionate Father, and heavenly Com∣forter; to be their Guide, their Portion and exceeding great Reward. What a solicitous Concern do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. <HI>Moses,</HI> express upon this Head in the Text? <HI>If thy Presence go not along with me carry us not up hence.</HI> The same Concern in some Proportion, influences every pious and devout Soul. And no Wonder, For,</P>
<P N="1">1. They are sensible That their Pre∣servation from Sin, Temptation and all Evil, depends upon the gracious and favourable Presence of God. Not only the Word of God; but repeated Expe∣riences of their own, have abundantly taught them, the Inssufficiency and Weak∣ness of all other Places of Refuge and Defence. To conquer a hase Lust or Passion, to eradicate the inviterate Habits of Vice and Sin; or withstand the Force of a violent Temptation, they have for∣med to be an <HI>Herculean Labour,</HI> surpass∣ing their own Strength. <HI>David,</HI> when he goes forth in the Name and Strength of the Lord of Hosts, the God of the Armies of <HI>Israel,</HI> is more than a March for a gyamick <HI>Goliath,</HI> whom he
<PB N="40" REF="004293_0051_10040CBC314F17B8"/>
presently lays sprawling at his feet, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 17. 50, 51. But when left to himself, without the concurring Influ∣ences, of Corroborating Grace, he is presently overcome by a vile Lust. 2 <HI>Sam</HI> 10. 4. A Sense his own Weak∣ness in that lamentable Instance, was (no doubt) an O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sion of that particu∣lar Petition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Prayer, <HI>Psalm.</HI> 51.</P>
<P N="2">2. —<HI>Uphold me with thy free Spirit. Peter,</HI> being too confident of his own Strength when he sa d to our blessed Saviour, <HI>Mat.</HI> 26. 35. <HI>Tho' I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.</HI> Being left to himself, repeatedly deny'd his Master, and at last with horrid Oaths and Imprecations, a dreadfol Aggravati∣on of that horrid Crime, <HI>ver.</HI> 74. He (no doubt) thought he had rather die, and when he said it, believed that he should sooner yield his dear Life a Sa∣crifice, in his Masters Cause, than dis∣own or deny him. But when God withdrew his strengthening Presence from him, soon found by sad Experience, the Fear of Man to be a Snare; too strong a Temptation for his own best formed Resolutions, to hold out against How poorly accomplished then is feeble Man, in his own Strength, to fight
<PB N="41" REF="004293_0052_10040EB7C8DA6F08"/>
against Principalities and Powers, and the Rulers of the Darkness of this World, against Spiritual Wickedness, in high Places, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6. 12. <HI>But through the Grace and Strength of Christ, they may come off more than Conquerers in this spiritual Warfare</HI> For it is God that heacheth their Hands to War, and their Fingers to fight. This the Saints and faithful Servants of God have learn∣ed, by Experience, Thus <HI>David, Sam.</HI> 22. 33. <HI>God is my Strength and Power, and he maketh my Way perpect,</HI> Psalm. 18. 29.—34, 35. <HI>By thee</HI> (says he) <HI>I have run through a</HI> TROOP, <HI>by my God have I leaped over a Wall. He teacheth mine Hands to War so that a Bow of Steel is broken by mine Arms. Thou hast also given me the Shield of thy Salvation: And thy Right Hand hath bolden me up.</HI> No Won∣der then the Saints are solicitously con∣cerned for, and desireous of, the graci∣ous and favourable Presence of God, since it is their Security against the prevailing Power of Temptation and Sin. As to this, God, and not their Strength, is their Confidence, <HI>Psalm.</HI> 26, 1. <HI>I hav trusted in the Lord: There∣fore I shall not slide.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="004293_0053_10040EBC6CD5B4F8"/>And as to the Casualties of this un∣certain and changable World, they know that God is the Rock of their Salvati∣on. <HI>The Lord is my Defence</HI> (says the Psalmi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) <HI>and my God is the Rock of my Refuge. Psalm.</HI> 94 22. They have good Assurance of all necessary Protection and Defence, if Gods Presence goes along them, in their various Ways and Concerns: For God hath said, and, Shall he not make it good? <HI>Job.</HI> 5. 19, 20, 22, 23. <HI>He shall deliver thee in Six Troubles; yea in Seven there shall no Evil touch thee. In Famine, he shall re∣deem thee from Death: And in War, from the Power of the Sword: Thou shall be bid from the Scourge of the Tongue: Neither shall thou be afraid of Destruction when it cometh. At Destruction and Famine thou shall laugh: Neither shall thou be afraid of the Beasts of the Earth. For thou shall be in league with the Stones of the Field: And the Beasts of the Field shall be at Peace with thee.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Pious and devout Souls have an experimental Knowledge of the great Ad∣vantage of the divine Presence, both as to Duty and Comfort. As to Duty, they have often found the Grace and
<PB N="43" REF="004293_0054_10040EC1DBA408D8"/>
Strength of Christ made perfect in their Weakness. And upon this Account they do, ask it were, glory in their Infirmi∣ties: Thus it was with St. <HI>Paul</HI> in a Time of great Temptation, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. 9 10: <HI>And be said unto me. My Grace is sufficient for thee: For my Strength is made perfect in Weakness: Most grad∣ly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmi∣ties that the Power of Christ may rest upon me. Therefore I take Pleasure in Reproaches, in Necessities, in Persecutions, in Distresses for Christ's Sake: For when I am weak then am I strong.</HI> Upon the same Foun∣dation, <HI>David</HI> draws up that Resoluti∣on, <HI>Psalm.</HI> 71. 16. <HI>I will go in the Strength of the Lord God: I will make mention of thy Righteousness. even of thine only.</HI> And as to Comfort, it is God that by the refreshing Influences of his Presence giveth Songs in the dark∣nest Night of Trouble, <HI>Job.</HI> 35. 10. The Lord, by the Blessings of his Presence, shall comfort <HI>Zion, Isa.</HI> 51. 3. His Saints and faithful Servants have tasted the Sweets of his Presence. in this Respect, in Times of Distress and Trouble, <HI>Psalm.</HI> 91. 19. <HI>In the Multitude of my Thoughts within me, thy Comforts deligth my Soul.</HI> God's gracious and favourable
<PB N="44" REF="004293_0055_10040CC01B283D70"/>
Presence will not only afford sufficient Support and Comfort, in the most gloomy Season of outward Trouble here; but even in the dark Valley of the Shadow of Death. Hence <HI>David's</HI> Re∣solution, <HI>Psam.</HI> 23 4. <HI>Yea though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil, for thou art with me, thy Rod and they Staff, they comfort me.</HI> The Presence of God is their Support, their Comfort and Song in the House of their Pilgrimage, and in him do they make their Boast all the Day long.</P>
<P><HI>Hence,</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. They know that their Case will be very sad and deplorable, if God withdraws his gracious and favourable Presence from them, <HI>Hos.</HI> 9. 12. <HI>Wo to them when I depart from them</HI> What an awful. Circumstance was <HI>Saul</HI> in when uttered those Words? 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 28. 15. <HI>The Philistines make War against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more neither by Prophets nor by Dreams.</HI> If God withdraws his gracious and favourable Presence, What will become of that poor weak, feeble, sinful Creature, <HI>Man</HI>? He will then have no Safe-Guide to lead him in the Way of Duty; no effectual Restraint
<PB N="45" REF="004293_0056_10040EC8E3AF9308"/>
on his Lusts; no powerful Antidote against Temptations; no impregn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble helmet to secure against threatening Mischiefs; but will, unquestionably wander out of the Way of Peace and Happyness, and pine away in Sin, under the Curse of God. No Wonder then, that pious and devout Souls are solici∣tously concerned for the Enjoyment of God's gracious and favourable Pre∣sence.</P>
<P N="2">2. It should be the solicitous Concern of all, to engage the Presence of God with them in all their Undertakings. That this ought to lye very near the Hearts of all, both Young and Old, might be abundantly argued from what has been said, already, of the vast Con∣sequence of the divine Presence with the Children of Men, in all their Un∣dertakings.</P>
<P>But, passing those Remarks, I shall but a little more than mention Two Things under this Head, which may serve to discover how necessary it is, That every one should be solicitously concerned to engage the divine Presence, which is of so great Consequence, to
<PB N="46" REF="004293_0057_10040ECBB7C99DC0"/>
the Children of Men, and as power∣ful Motives put us upon it.</P>
<P N="1">1. If you don't endeavour with a proper Concern to engage the divine Presence, you can't reasonably expect any thing but to miss of it. <HI>If you for∣sake God be will cast you for ever,</HI> 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28. 9. And, what an Inunda∣tion of Woe and Misery will then break in upon you, and overwhelm you? <HI>Deur.</HI> 31. 16, 17. <HI>And the Lord said unto Moses, behold, thou shall steep with thy Fathers, and this People will rise up, and go a Whoring after the Gods of the Stran∣gers of the Land, whether they go to be amongst them, and will forsake me, and break my Covenant which I have made with them. Then my Anger shall be kindl∣ed against them in that Day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my Face from them, and they shall be devoured and many Evils and Troubles shall be∣fall them, so that they will say in that Day, Are not these Evils come upon us, because our God is not amongst us?</HI> In a Word, <HI>They that forsake the Lord shall be consumed</HI> Isai. 1. 28. And what less do they do, who dont take due Care to engage his divine Presence, <HI>by</HI> walk∣ing
<PB N="47" REF="004293_0058_10040ECFBB276308"/>
with him in the Way of Duty, who set light by God's Presence, as <HI>Israel</HI> did of Old, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. 15. <HI>But</HI> Jeshurun <HI>waxed fat, and kicked: Thou art waxen fat, thou art thick, thou art covered with Fatness; then he forsook the God which made him, and lightly esteem∣ed the Rock of his Salvation.</HI> An hor∣rible Crime surely! That justly expos∣es the Guilty, to God's awful Dis∣pleasure, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 19,—<HI>Know therefore and see, that it is an Evil Thing and Bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my Fear is not in thee, faith the Lord God of Hosts.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. If you make it your solicitous Concern to engage the Presence of God with you in all your Undertakings, you have a great deal of Reason, to en∣courage your selves, with an Expecta∣tion of the Blessings of the divine Presence. <HI>If you seek him, he will be found of you,</HI> forecited, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28. 9. <HI>For he loves them that love him, and they that seek him early shall find him,</HI> Prov. 8. 17,—<HI>He hath never said unto the Seed of</HI> Jacob, Seek ye me in vain. <HI>Isai.</HI> 45. 19. But his Voice is this; <HI>Seek and ye shall find.</HI> see <HI>Mat.</HI> 7. 7.
<PB N="48" REF="004293_0059_10040ED4B94C0B88"/>
So that it will be your own Fault, if you don't enjoy the gracious and Fa∣vourable Presence of God with you in your various Ways and Concerns. Where∣fore, if you would be wise for your selves, you must do your Utmost to engage God's Presence with you in every Enterprize and Undertaking, those especially that are attended with any peculiar Hazard, Dificulty or Danger. Saying as <HI>Moses</HI> in my Text. <HI>If thy Presence go not with me, carry us not up Hence.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>I come now to make some particular Improvement of the</HI> Doctrine, <HI>under Two or Three Heads, distinctly.</HI></P>
<P>USE I. Is the gracious and favou∣rable Presence of God of such vast Con∣sequence unto the Children of Men in all their Undertakings (as we've hear'd) but especially in those that are attended with any peculiar Hazard and Danger? Then the Circumstances of those are sad and deplorable to whom God denies his gracious and favourable Presence. The Ubiquity of God's essential Presence none can escape. It would be an happy Case for the
<PB N="49" REF="004293_0060_10040EDC4E0B8908"/>
Devils, and Damned in Hell, if they could fly and hide from the Presence and Face of him that sitteth on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb, <HI>Rev.</HI> 6. 16. But this they can∣not, neither Dens nor Caves, Rocks nor Mountains can secure them from the dreadful Impressions of God's Wrath∣ful Presence. And tho' the finally Im∣penitent, whilst they are here in this World, may be encompassed about, with with the outward Blessings of Provi∣dence may, <HI>Wash their Steps with Butter, and the Rock may pour out Rivers of Oyl to them,</HI> as the Phrase is, <HI>Job</HI> 29. 6. <HI>So that they have more than Heart can wish,</HI> Psalm. 73. 7. Yet the Curse of God is upon them: They are cursed in their Persons and Enjoyments: There is Poison in their most pleasant Cups. Concerning such, God says as in <HI>Mal.</HI> 2. 2. —<HI>I will curse your Blessings, yea,</HI> I <HI>have cursed them already.</HI>— Their Pros∣perity doth but fatten them up against the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y of Slaughter. For, <HI>As the Lord knoweth how to deliver the Godly out of Temptation</HI>; s<HI>o also to re∣serve the Wicked to the Day of Judgment to be punished,</HI> 2 Pet. 2. 9. And if, in their most Flourishing Circumstances,
<PB N="50" REF="004293_0061_10040CCCAA0D32A0"/>
they are in a cursed and deplor∣able Condition: How doleful must their Case be, when under the dread∣ful Frowns of an angry God, in this World? Miserable Wretches! In the Time of Prosperity, tho' you are cursed Creatures, without God, without Christ and without Hope in the World: Yet (it may be) you Bless your Selves, in your own Hearts, and say unto your Souls as the Fool in the Gospel, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12. 19. —<HI>Eat drink and be merry.</HI> Thinking with those profane Monsters, <HI>Isai.</HI> 56. 12. That, <HI>To-morrw shall be as this Day, and much more abundant.</HI> Yet, What will you do in the Day of your Calamity? When God shall strip you naked of those outward En∣joyments which you value your selves so much upon. Your Prosperity is but short, and your Rejoycing but for a Moment: The Days of Evil are coming and they shall be many. How do you expect to hold our, in the Day of the Lord's indignation? Without any Staff to support, or Cordial to revive your sinking Spirits. Behold, the Clouds thicken a-pace, the Heavens are cloath∣ed with Blackness, as with a Covering of Sackcloth, The terrible Voice of the

Death looks you in the Face on every Side; you are over∣whelmed in the Deeps, and now must in a few Moments appear before God's Judgment Seat. O! what will you do in this last Extremity, if God be not with you? How can you pass through the dark Valley of the Shadow of Death without his supporting Staff and comforting Rod? <HI>What will you do in the Day Visitation, and in this Hour of Desolation? To whom will ye flee for Help? And where will you leave your Glory</HI>? Isai. 10. 3.

call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me.</HI></P>
<P>USE II. Let it then be the solicitous Con∣cern of every one of us, to engage the gracious and favourable Presence of God with us in all our Undertakings; especially those that are attended with any peculiar Hazard or Danger. No Safety, or real Prosperity, can reasonably be expected in any Design, without the special Presence of God. We should therefore make it the main Article of our Concern to get God to go along with us in all our Undertakings, and by Consequence, it is reasonable that our Concern should be heightened in proportion to the Dif∣ficulty, Danger and Importance of the Enterprize we are engaging in, whether by Sea or Land; the Former, of which (as I've already observed) is attended with peculiar Hazard and Danger.</P>
<P>Wherefore, let those that are going from us, to do Business upon the great Deeps, be prevailed with, to make it their great Concern, to get God to go along with them, in a Way of Mercy, Grace and Favour.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="004293_0064_10040CD4A8508E80"/>And in order to that blessed Purpose, give me leave to recommend some Things to your serious Consideration and Religious Practice; by way of Counsel and Direction, in which I would act the Part of a true Friend (as I really am) to your Souls, and the Souls of all my Hearers; who are equally concern∣ed with you in the following Words of Advice; as they desire the Presence of the ever blessed JEHOVAH, to go along with them, in any and all their Undertakings, whether common or more extraordinary.</P>
<P>What I shall offer by way of Counsel and Direction, may be reduced to Two general Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be very careful least you provoke God to withdraw from you, and refuse to go along with you.</P>
<P N="2">2. Do what in you lies, to engage the gracious and favourable Presence of God with you in all your Undertakings.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be very careful, least you provoke God to withdraw from you, and refuse to go along with you. In general,

Take head, and beware of Sin, all Sin, Sin of every Kind; those Sins especi∣ally, to which you are most exposed in your Calling and way of Life. God is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniqui∣ty. He cannot look upn Sin, or Sinners with Approbation or Allowance; but with the greatest Detestation and Ab∣horrence, <HI>Mab.</HI> 1. 17. Nothing like Sin, to provoke as holy God to withdraw his gracious and favourable Presence from the Children of Men, <HI>Isai.</HI> 59. 2. <HI>Your Iniquities have seperated between you and your God, and your Sins have bid his Face from you, that he will not hear.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But to come to some Particulars,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Keep, as much as possibly you can, out of the Way of Temptation, <HI>Lead us not into Temptation,</HI> is one Article in that Pattern of Prayer, which our Lord Jesus Christ taught his Disciples, <HI>Matt.</HI> 6. 13. Wherefore, as our Imbecillity and Weakness to withstand Temptations, should make us repair to God for Grace and Strength; so in Point, both of Duty and Prudence, it should make us
very careful to keep out of the Way
<PB N="55" REF="004293_0066_10040EF38974CAA8"/>
of Temptation; for if we run into Temp∣tation, we have little Reason to expect that God will preserve us from the power of it. To go in Harms Way, when there is no Need of, it is a great Degree of Presumption, Folly and Mad∣ness. Take heed therefore of dallying with Temptations in Presumption of your own Strength, or the Aids of su∣pernatural Grace to preserve you; many have fallen grieviously, been wounded sorely, nay, slain by such Presumptious Folly, and Madness.</P>
<P><HI>Here I would Caution you against,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Those Places.</P>
<P N="2">2. Those Objects, And,</P>
<P N="3">3 Those Persons, That may prove a Snare to you, and prevail with you to walk in the broad Way of De∣struction.</P>
<P N="1">1. Take heed of, yea fly from such Places, as are notorious for Wicked∣ness least you be taken in the Snare of the Infernal Fowler. Open Semi∣naries of Lewdness and Debauchery, if not Countenanc'd by Authority (which is the Case in some Parts of the World)
<PB N="56" REF="004293_0067_10040CDBD1FE2F98"/>
yet under no special Marks of Insamy you may meet with; but, O let me intreat you to avoid them as you would one that has the Plague. Do you love your Selve, your Souls, your Bodys, your Estates? Take heed of such Theatres of Vice and Sin. Strong Inducements and Temptations you may meet with, to draw you into the Way of the Wick∣ed: But as <HI>Solomon</HI> says, <HI>Prov.</HI> 4. 15. <HI>Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it and pass away The Lips of an whorish Woman may drop as an Honey-Comb, and her Mouth may be smoother than Oyl; But her End is bitter as Wormwood, sharp as a Two Edged Sword; her Feet go down to Death, her Steps take hold on Hell,</HI> Prov. 5. 3, 4. 5. Wherefore, as it follows, Verses, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <HI>Hear me now O ye Children, and depart not from the Words of my Mouth. Remove thy Way far from her, and come not nigh the Door of her House, left thou give thine Honour unto others, and thy Years to the Cruel. Left Strangers be filled win thy Wealth, and thy Labours be in the House of a Stranger. And thou mourn at last when thy Flesh and thy Body are consumed. Can a Man take Fire in his Bosom and his Cloaths not be burnt? Can one go
<PB N="57" REF="004293_0068_10040EFAB0D213D0"/>
upon hot Coals and his Feet not be burnt</HI>? Prov. 6. 27, 28.</P>
<P N="2">2. Be not familiar with such Objects as have a Tendency to provoke the Lusts and Corruptions of your depraved Na∣tures. Would you avoid the Snare of the strange Woman? <HI>Look not upon, Lust not after her Beauty in thine Heart, neither let her take thee with her Eye∣lids,</HI> Prov. 6. 25. Would you avoid Intem∣perance? Keep under your Carnal Ap∣petites, and don't make Provision for the Flesh to fulfil the Lusts thereof. <HI>Look not thou upon the Wine when it is red, when it giveth his Colour in the Cup; when it moveth it self aright. At the last it biteth like a Serpent, and sting∣eth like an Adder,</HI> Prov. 23. 31. 32.</P>
<P N="3">3. Take heed, and beware of Evil Company, <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, <HI>Prov.</HI> 13. 20. <HI>That he, that walketh with Wife Men shall be wife, but a Companion of Fools shall be destroyed.</HI> It may be, your Call∣ing and way of Business, will render it necessary for you to have some Con∣verstion with very vile &amp; wicked Men, yea, sometimes, it may be unavoidable, but let it not be your Choice, don't
<PB N="58" REF="004293_0069_10040EFF2D6FB2D8"/>
frequent such Company without Necessity, left you be infected with their Plague, which is a mortal Disease. <HI>My Son, be not amongst Wine Bibbers, amongst ri∣otous Eaters of Flesh,</HI> Prov. 23. 20. <HI>left thou learn their Ways and get a Snare to thy Soul.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thus much for the first Particular.</HI></P>
<P>Keep as much as you can out of the Way of Temptation. But inasmuch as the World is full of Temptations, and your Business may sometims necessarily, and unavoidably lead you in the Way of those that are very strong and powerful.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. Be always upon your Watch and Guard, and see to it that you are well fortified within, being forwarned, get your selves well Arm'd to withstand all the Assaults that, shall be made against you from one Quarter or another: That so, nothing you meet with, may inter∣rupt a steady Walk with God, or turn you out the Way of Duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. Get, and maintain, a tender Consci∣ence: A seared, stupid Conscience ren∣ders a Man an easie Prey to Tempta∣tion.
<PB N="59" REF="004293_0070_10040F01203792E8"/>
When the Soul has no lively Sease of the Evil of Sin, one of the most powerful Restraints is broken: And little, if any Thing, besides Shame remains to prevent a ready Compliance with forcable Temptation; for where there is no lively Sense of the Evil of Sin, Fears of Divine Wrath will in some Proportion abate, or rather will not be lively and operative, and as to Shame, which has a very considerable Influence upon a modest and virtuous Disposition; it presently loses its Force, when the Practice of Vice and Sin becomes sashi∣onable. So that a stupid Conscience is not only a Token of the Divine Withdrawings; but that which lament∣ably exposes a Person to the power of Temptation and Sin. This discovers the Importance and Necessity, in this Cafe, of a lively and tender Conscience.</P>
<P N="2">2. Every Day before you go into Com∣pany, or engage in Business, renew your Covenant Obligations to God by solemn Acts of Devotion; not only recommend your Persons and all your Concerns to the Conduct, Protection and Care of Almighty God, by solemn and servent Prayer; but therein renew your own
<PB N="60" REF="004293_0071_10040F09E1AAF908"/>
Covenant Bonds, to be the Lords, in all your Ways, saying as <HI>David Psalm</HI> 116. 16. <HI>O Lord, truly I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant, and the Son of thy Hand∣maid.</HI> Therein sincerly rsolving to have a due Respect to all God's Command∣ments. The Awe of such fresh and re∣peated Dedications of your selves to God and his Service, if duely performed, will have a very powerful Restraint upon you to keep you from Sin, and be a mighty Incentive to Duty.</P>
<P N="3">3. At all Times, maintain a realizing Belief, of the all-seeing Eye of your great Judge, which is always upon you. A firm Belief of the Divine Omniscience, in order to future Judgment, would certainly have a mighty Awe upon our Spirits, not only to make us serious and diligent in Duty, but watchful against Temptation. <HI>Beer-lahai roi,</HI> The Name which <HI>Hagar</HI> gave to the <HI>Well,</HI> where God appeared unto her, <HI>Gen.</HI> 16. 14. was much to the Purpose: It signifying, <HI>The Well of him that lives and sees me</HI>: For she said, Vers. 13.—<HI>Thou God seest me.</HI> This certainly would be a very seasonable and serviceabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Tho't, when we are entring into Duty or assaulted
<PB N="61" REF="004293_0072_10040D1A5F3AB488"/>
by Temptation, to censider, That the Eye of that God, who lives for ever, and will one Day be our Judge, is up∣on us, and that he will call us to a strict Account in the Day when the Secrets of all Hearts shall be made manifest. Will a Man venture to break the Law in open Court, or affront the Judge to his Face?</P>
<P N="4">4. Exercise your Tho'ts much upon such Subjects as may have a Tendency to take away the Force of those Temp∣tations, you do, or are most likely to meet with. Such you may meet with abroad in the World, as will endeavour not only to draw you into the Ways of Vice and Wickedness, by the pleasant Baits of Pleasure and Profit; but to fright or banter you out of all Virtue, Religion and Goodness, by their angry or reproachful Treatment: But let none of these Things which you may meet with, move you from the Line of Duty. Are you reproached and abused by vile Men because you refuse to run into the same excess of Riot with others? And it maybe, branded with much more dishonour∣able Names than <HI>Precisian, Puritan,</HI> or <HI>New England Presbyterian</HI>; if these can
<PB N="62" REF="004293_0073_10040F0CB4E0BE40"/>
be called dishonourable, as they are un∣justly esteemed by some; yet, regard if not, but consider that the Testimony of a good Conscience with the Comforts flowing therefrom, and the Approbati∣on of your great Judge in the last Day, will incomparably, more than make A∣mends for all such Abuses, and the Pains you may take in maintaining your Integrity.</P>
<P>Whereas, on the other Hand, if you are banter'd out of your Innocency, and frighted into a mean and servile Com∣pliance with the vicious Humours, and wicked Practices of Others, you may expect to be filled with very uneasie Reslections upon your selves, at the best, to have your Hearts broken with the Sorrows of Repentance, otherwise, to be eternally reproached, affrighted and distressed with whole Armies of errors in the Place of the Damned, under the the dreadful Impressions of the Wrath of God. And as to the Pleasures and Profits of the World, are they presented to you, in the most en∣gaging Appearance, to corrupt your fi∣dility and tempt your from your Duty, consider, that by a base Compliance
<PB N="63" REF="004293_0074_10040CEEAB882A40"/>
with the Temptation, you'll forfeit the Gains of Godliness, the unfullied Glory and durable Riches of God's heavenly Kingdom; And so be banished eternally from the Presence of God where there is fullness of Joy and Pleasures for ever more. <HI>Wherefore my Son, if Sinners en∣tice thee, consent thou not, if they say Come with us, let us lay wait for Blood, let us lurk privily for the Innocent with∣out Cause: Let us swallow them up alive as tbe Grave; and whole as th se that go down to tbe Pit: We shall find all precious Substances, we shall fill our Houses with Spoil: Cast in thy Lot among us, let us all have one Purse: My Son, walk not thou in the Way with them, refrain thy Foot from their Path,</HI> Prov. 1. 10.—15.</P>
<P N="5">5. Have your Hearts ever lifted up to God for Grace and Srength to with∣stand, resist and overcome Temptation. The Case may be so circumstanced, that you may have a great deal of Reason to say as <HI>Jebosaphat</HI> did in another Case, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 20. 12. <HI>O our God, wilt thou not Judge them? For we have no Might against this greatCompany that cometh against us: Neither know we what to do, but our Eyes are upon thee.</HI> God only can
<PB N="64" REF="004293_0075_10040F168D10AA60"/>
give you an happy Victory over the World, bruise <HI>Satan</HI> and all his In∣struments under your Feet for you; and save you from the Power of Temptati∣on: Trust in him at all Times.</P>
<P>Thus much for the Second Particular, be always upon your Watch and Guard, and see to it, that you are well for∣tified against Temptation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Suffer no Lust or vicious Passion to reign in or rule over you. If Sin reigns in your mortal Bodys and you obey it in the Lusts thereof, no Wonder if God withdraws his gracious and fa∣vourable Presence from you. Unmorti∣fied Lust indulged and gratified will inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le the Anger of an holy God, and Fewel to the fearful Flames of his Jealousie, which will burn to the low∣est Hell; unless seasonably prevented. Wherefore get rid of every Lust and vile Passion, else you'll forfeit and lose God's favourable Presence, and by con∣sequence, be laid open and exposed to all manner of Evils, both here and forever,</P>
<P N="4">4. Take beed and beware of a <HI>Laodicean Lakemurmnest</HI> in Religion: A Spirit
<PB N="65" REF="004293_0076_10040F199F9C21F0"/>
of Indifferency with Reference to the Things of God, and of the eternal World, is become very modish and fashionable in this degenerate Age: There is so much the more Need therefore to watch against it, especially, since it will ex∣pose the Guilty to God's loathing Dis∣pleasure, make him depart from such, and as it were, <HI>spve them out of his Mouth.</HI> Rev. 3. 16. What then will become of those that have no Religion at all! But make a Mock of every Thing that is sacred. <HI>O my Soul, come not thou into their Secret; unto their Assembly, mine Honour be not thou uni∣ted: For they spake evil of the Things they understood not, and shall utterly pe∣rish in their own Corruption.</HI> 2 Pet. 2: 12</P>
<P N="5">5. Let not your Hopes and Expecta∣tions from the World be raised, with∣out a suitible Dependance upon God. God is to be acknowledged in all our Ways, and therefore our Dependance, for Direction, Safety, and Success in all our Undertakings, should be upon him: Otherwise we shall cast Contempt up∣on the God of all our Mercies; and provoke him to leave and forsake us.
<PB N="66" REF="004293_0077_10040F2023863148"/>
<HI>Wherefore put not your Trust in Princes, nor in the Son of Man in whom there is no Help.</HI> Psal. 146. 3. Yea, let us not trust in, nor reckon too much upon, uncertain Riches, but <HI>trust in the living God, who giveth us richly all Things to enjoy.</HI> 1 Tim. 6. 17. <HI>Commit thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto the Lord, trust also in him, and he shall bring it pass.</HI> Psal. 37. 6.</P>
<P>This brings me to the second gene∣ral Head of Counsel and Direction.</P>
<P N="2">2. Do what in you lies to engage the gracious and favourable Presence of God with you, in all your Under∣takings. Certainly this is well worth your while, if what you have heard, concerning the Necessity and Benefit of the Divine Presence be true, as undoub∣tedly it is.</P>
<P><HI>Wherefore,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Be sure to make your Peace with God, before it is too late; and there∣fore without any Delay. Sin has cer∣tainly made a Breach between God and you. A fearful Breach! And you can never enjoy God's gracious Presence,
<PB N="67" REF="004293_0078_10040CF5514B1020"/>
untill this Breach is made up, by an happy Reconciliation. <HI>For how can two walk together unless they be agreed?</HI> Amos 3. 3. Be perswaded then to take the Advice of <HI>Eliphaz</HI> Job 22. 21. <HI>Ac∣quaint now thy self with him, and be at Peace, thereby Good shall come unto thee.</HI> In order hereunto, comply with God's own Terms of Peace, as they are pre∣scribed in the Gospel of Peace. Re∣pent of, mortisy and forsake all Sin, which is the Cause of God's Contro∣versy with you: And accept of the Lord Jesus Christ the great Peace-ma∣ker, upon his own Terms, as your Pro∣phet, Priest and King. Make sure of our Union to him, and then all is well. <HI>For he is the Son of God's Love, in whom the Father is well pleased.</HI> Matth. 3. 17. And therefore if united to him, he will be well pleased with you in him. And then you may be assured that he will never leave vou nor for∣sake you. But if you continue in your Enmity to, and Distance from God, in∣stead of being encompass'd about with the Blessings of his Presence, as with a Shield; an angry God will pursue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the dreadfull Storms of his Indignation, untill you are consumed.
<PB N="68" REF="004293_0079_10040F2A9E4E5CA0"/>
Don't then procrastinate or delay any longer in this important Concern. For as St. <HI>Paul</HI> says, 2 Cor. 6. 2. <HI>Behold now is the accepted Time: Behold now is the Day of Salvation.</HI> It is gone into a Proverb, That To-morrow is a new Day: But To-morrow has no Be∣ing, and it may be never will with you. Prov. 27. 1. <HI>Boast not thy self of To-Mor∣row; for thou knowest not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> It may bring forth thy Death, and then where art thou, if thy Peace be not made with God? This Evening all Things may be seem∣ingly well, a pleasant Gale, a clear Sky, and no Sign or Token of Danger, but before Morning you are foundred in the Deeps; and then what will be∣come of your poor Souls, if you are in ill Terms with God? O, they'll sink, sink, sink eternally in the bottom∣less Abyss of Divine Wrath.</P>
<P N="2">2. Take God for your God in Cove∣nant, and with the utmost Sincerity de∣vote your selves to his Grace and Ser∣vice, making it your great Concern to walk answerably. It may be you have been given up to God, in Baptism: And by a solemn Profession of Religion,
<PB N="69" REF="004293_0080_10043E538AEB74B8"/>
have owned the true and living God for your God; this is all well if you have done it aright; but don't rest in what you have done: Make frequent and fresh Surrenders of your selves to the Grace and Service of God, And having opened your Mouth unto the Lord take Care to pay your Vows, by an agreeable Conduct and Conversation, remembring what the wise Man says, Eccl. 5. 4. 5. <HI>When thou vowest a Vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no Pleasure in Fools; pay that which thou hast vowed. Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou should∣est vow and not pay.</HI> It has been the Practice of good Men, when they have taken in Hand any weighty Enterprize, to bind themselves to God by a solemn Vow, in order to engage his Presence and Blessing. Thus did <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen. 28. 20. 21, <HI>And</HI> Jacob <HI>vowed a Vow, saying, If God will be with me, and will keep me in this Way that I go, and will give me Bread to eat, and Raiment to put on, so that I come again to my Father's House in Peace: Then shall the Lord be my God.</HI> And who can say that such a Thing would be unlawful at this time o'<HI>Day.</HI> To be sure it is
<PB N="70" REF="004293_0081_10040CF8F8CA8748"/>
our Duty, in a most solemn Manner, to enter into Covenant with God, and then to walk answerable thereunto, up∣on which, there is good Ground to hope for the divine Presence and Bles∣sing. God will be with his People and Children in Covenant, <HI>shewing Mercy to Thousands of them that love him and keep his Commandments.</HI> Exod. 20. 6. For as <HI>David</HI> testifies, Psal. 103. 17. <HI>The Mercy of the Lord is from Ever∣lasting to Everlasting upon them that fear him: And his Righteousness unto Chil∣dren's Children,</HI> (Ver. 18.) <HI>To such as keep his Covenant; and to those that re∣member his Commandments to do them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In all your Undertakings let the Honour and Glory of God be your last End. That certainly is a Precept of universal Influence and Obligation, which is written in 1 Cor. 10. 31. <HI>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the Glory of God.</HI> This should be our Mark in all our Undertakings; and the Purpose to which we improve all our Time and Talents, endeavouring to advance the Honour and Glory of God in all our
<PB N="71" REF="004293_0082_10043E5C13889C40"/>
Ways, and then we need not fear but that God will honour us with the Blessings of his Presence, for he hath said, 1 Sam. 2. 30. <HI>Them that honour me, I will honour; and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Resign up your selves to his Di∣rection, Care and Keeping; and be wil∣ling to have your Persons disposed of and your Circumstances ordered accor∣ding to God's Pleasure, therein ac∣knowledging and adoring the Wisdom and Sovereignty of God's Providence. A Soul thus resigned and given up to God, has no Ground to question the Fulfillment of those Promises of God, wherein he has engaged his Presence and Blessing to his People and Chil∣dren; through all the Vicissitudes of changeable Time.</P>
<P N="5">5. Bear upon your Minds the most grateful Resentments, of all the signal Discoveries of God's gracious and fa∣vourable Presence, you have been bless'd with; whether as to Temptations, by strengthening you against them, and making way for your Escape; or, as to extraordinary Dangers, by appearing in
<PB N="72" REF="004293_0083_10040CFEEA485F10"/>
the Mount of Difficulty, and comman∣ding seasonable Salvations for you, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In what Way soever, whether by Sea or Land, God has appeared for you, in a signal Manner, don't forget it, but give God all the Glory of it. Let the Remembrance thereof fill your Hearts with Gratitude, and furnish you with Arguments of Praise and Thanks∣giving to God. This will not only fit you for, but be a Pledge and hap∣py Assurance of God's gracious and fa∣vourable Presence with you for the Time to come.</P>
<P N="6">6. Maintain and keep alive the Pow∣er of Godliness, both in your Hearts, and Practices. Wherever you go, whe∣ther by Sea or Land, be sure that you have the Power and Principle of the Spiritual and divine Life within; exemplified, in an agreeable Practice. Without this, you have little Reason to expect that God will go along with you in a way of Grace and Fa∣vour.</P>
<P>I have heard there is a Saying that passes among some of our Seamen, in these Parts of the World, that when they go off to Sea, they leave their
<PB N="73" REF="004293_0084_10043E6690B75BA0"/>
Religion at a certain island, and take it up again at their Return, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is too true with many of them, if they have any Religion at all; though they had e'en as good have none, as such in hypocritical Vizor, that they can put off and on as easily as a loose Garment: It will be of no real Service to them either by Sea or Land. For it is vital Piety, the Pow∣er of Godliness, and that only, that will engage the gracious and favoura∣ble Presence of God to go along with you. Leave this behind and, in a Sense, you leave God too. For though he is essentially present every where, yet not in a way of Grace and Fa∣vour.</P>
<P N="7">7. Plead with God by earnest and servent Prayer, that he would g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g with you in all your Ways. And ven∣ture not upon any Enterprize. but what you can with an holy Confidence, re∣commend to God by Prayer. What can't be pray'd over, with a good Con∣science, may not be practiced. But eve∣ry lawful Design, we may and ought, and O it is a great Priviledge. that we may recommend it to God by
<PB N="74" REF="004293_0085_10040D025CFBEC00"/>
Prayer. See to it then, that you improve this precious Priviledge: by doing your Duty, in this particular Article of it. Are any of you engaging in any ha∣zardous Enterprize? Going from us, to do Business upon the Seas, and in fo∣reign Countries, with an agonizing Im∣portunity plead for God's gracious and favourable Presence. Saying as <HI>Moses</HI> in the Text, <HI>If thy Presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</HI> This certainly is a Matter of the last Con∣sequence in all your Undertakings. For if God be not with us, our Circum∣stances are deplorable beyond Expression. But if his Presence go along with us we need not fear any Evil. Psal. 121. 5, 6, 7, 8. <HI>The Lord is thy Keeper: The Lord is thy Shade upon thy right Hand. The Sun shall not smite thee by Day; nor the Moon by Night. The Lord shall preserve thee from all Evil: He shall preserve thy Soul. The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in, from this Time forth and e∣ven forever more.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I had Thoughts of concluding, but I shall add one Word more by Way of Improvement.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="004293_0086_10043E72A0E4DA48"/>USE III. Is the gracious and favou∣rable Presence of God of such vast Consequence to the Children of Men, as we have heard, Then certainly we ought to be concerned for Others, as well as our selves; that they may en∣joy the Blessings of the divine Presence. Tho' Charity begins at home, yet it is not to terminate there. We are bound to love our Neighbours as our selves, and accordingly to seek their Good; which we can in no way so ef∣fectually consult, as by doing what in us lies, to engage the gracious and fa∣vourable Presence of God with them in their various Ways and Concerns. Hence in Proportion to the nearness of our Relation to them, and the Interest we have in them, our Concern for their Enjoyment of this comprehensive Pri∣viledge, should be increased: Especial∣ly, when they are engaging in any En∣terprize that is peculiarly hazardous and difficult. Since the gracious and favou∣rable Presence of God is the Summary of all Blessings, that can be wished for here; what greater Good can Parents seek for in behalf of their Children? which are Parts of themselves, than this, that God may go along with
<PB N="76" REF="004293_0087_10040D059E615800"/>
them, wherever they go, either by Sea or Land; and compass them about with his Favour, as with a Shield.</P>
<P>Give me leave then, to offer two or three Words of Counsel and Advice to those Parents, whose Children are going from them to do Business in many Waters. You desire, certainly you do, that the Presence of the Lord JEHOVAH might go along with them in so hazardous an Enterprize; well then, Do what in you lies that it may be so.</P>
<P N="1">1. Rest not till you have good Ground to believe, that Christ is formed in their Souls. Travel in Birth again for them, that they may be born again of Water and the Spirit, and so become new Creatures, being created anew in Christ Jesus, unto good Works; and then you need not question but that God will go along with them. They are his Children as well as yours; and he will not leave them, nor forsake them, but watch over them Night and Day, in Storms as well as in Calms, in strange Lands as well as in their own Country, when they pass through
<PB N="77" REF="004293_0088_10043E75A99C09E0"/>
the Waters God will be with them, and through the Rivers, they shall not overflow them, when they walk thro' the Fire, they shall not be burnt; neither shall the Flame kindle upon them. If Christ be formed in them, <HI>neither Death nor Life, nor Angels, nor Prin∣cipalities, nor Powers, nor Things present, nor Things to come, nor Height, nor Depth, nor any other Creature, shall be able to seperate them from the Love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</HI> Rom. 8. 38. 39.</P>
<P N="2">2. Recommend them to the Care of divine Providence, and trust God whol∣ly with them. Commit them to his Care and Keeping, and then believe it, be will take Care of them; whatever Casualties and Harms they may be ex∣posed to. If God be with them, sure∣ly, they shall want nothing that is necessary for them, unless we can sup∣pose that infinite Wisdom may be dis∣appointed, almighty Power conquered, and the immense Fountain of Free-Grace dryed or sealed up. What tho' they are going forth upon a Design, that is attended with many Casualties and Dangers, yet if they be the Charge

of divine Providence, all will be well. Therefore when you are afraid and concerned, trust in God; saying as in Psal. 112. 7. <HI>I will not be afraid of evil Tydings, my Heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. See to it, that your own Hearts be right in the Sight of God, and be faithful in his Covenant. This will not only afford you good Ground to hope for the Presence of God with your own Persons, but you'l have, upon this Account, a great deal of Reason to expect that God will be with your Children: You'l be better able to plead his covenant Promises on their Account: and with a comfortable Assurance of divine Care, to resign them to the sure Mercies of that Covenant, which (God hath commanded to a thousand Genera∣tion?, <HI>of them that love him and keep his Commandments.</HI> Deut. 7. 9.</P>
<P><HI>But to hasten to a Conclusion.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Send your Children away with your Blessing and Prayers; and let your Prayers ever attend them, even in the uttermost Parts of the Earth, and of the Sea. Did I say with your Blessing? I mean, with earnest Prayers to God, for his Blessing upon them. God only can bless efficaci∣ously:

Man may instrumentally, by wish∣ing and praying for Blessing upon Others. This do for your dear Children, who are going from you. You wish them well, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you do; Let your good Wishes be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to God, in earnest and frequent Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rs on their behalf; with utmost Im∣portunity, wrestle with God by Prayer, 'till you prevail with God to bless the Lads, and then none can reverse it. <HI>Who can curse those whom God hath blessed</HI>? Num. 22. 8. If God be with them all will be well. Therefore let your Prayers attend them, not only when they are go∣ing, but when gone from you. Prayer (if I may be allowed the Expression) has a long Arm; when they are Thousands of Miles distant from you, upon the Seas or Land, you may visit them by Prayer, take them up in the Arms of Faith, and carry them to the Throne of Grace, unwearied∣ly importuning Heaven's Blessing, on their Score as well as your own. And, Oh! may they, and you, and every one of us, when at the greatest Distance one from another, as to Place, daily meet at the Throne of Grace; with flaming A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dours of Devotion and Christian Charity, and then we need not doubt, but that God will be with us, and our's and bless us. Psal.

128. 5. 6. <HI>The Lord shall bless thee out of Zion: And thou shall see the Good of Jeru∣salem, all the Days of thy Life. Yea, thou shalt see thy Children's Children, and Peace upon Israel.</HI></P>
