<HEAD>THE LAMB slain, Worthy to be praised.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>REV. V. 11, 12.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And I beheld, and I heard the Voice of many Angels round about the Throne, and the Beasts, and the Elders, and the Number of them was ten thousand Times ten thousand, and Thousands of Thousands, Saying with a loud Voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wis∣dom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Blessing.</HI></Q>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N this Book we have the <HI>Revelation</HI> of Jesus Christ delivered to his Ser∣vant <HI>John,</HI> concerning Events relating to the Church to the last Judgment: Particularly, a wonderful Prophecy of the Rise and Reign of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> whose Coming is after <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Satan, with

all Power, and Signs, and lying Wonders</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thes. 2.9.</NOTE>; and then of his Destruction by the Vials of God's Wrath poured out upon him: And of the Advance∣ment of the Redeemer's Kingdom on the Ruins of the papal Empire, and Kingdom of Darkness.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of this Chapter, <HI>John</HI> seeth in Vision a sealed Book presented in his Hand who sitteth on the Throne, that is the Father. This Book no doubt was the Book of God's Counsels and Decrees respecting the Things which should befall his Church to the End of the World, this Book of the <HI>Revelation.</HI> Proclamation is then made by an Angel, <HI>Who is worthy to open the Book, and to loose the Seals thereof,</HI> v. 2. None of all the Crea∣tures is found able to reveal these deep Things of God, and to fulfil his Counsels, both which are sup∣posed, by a learned Expositer, to be comprehended in these Expressions. Upon this <HI>John</HI> weeps, ha∣ving an earnest Desire to know these hidden Things: While he is mourning, one of the Elders faith to him, Weep not: Behold, <HI>the Lion of the Tribe of</HI> Judah—<HI>hath prevailed to open the Book,</HI> v. 5. Upon which <HI>John</HI> beheld, and saw in the Midst of the Throne, <HI>a Lamb as it had been slain,</HI> v. 6: He who is a <HI>Lion,</HI> the Chief in Dignity and Strength, and of the royal Tribe, is represented also as a <HI>Lamb</HI> slain; for it was in virtue of his Obedience to Death, that he opened the Seals. When our Lord had taken the Book out of the Hand of the Father, the four <HI>Beasts,</HI> and the four and twenty Elders the Ministers and Church, fall down before <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> humble Adoration, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a

<HI>new Song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the Book, and to open the Seals thereof: For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy Blood, out of every Kindred, and Tongue and People, and Nation.</HI> A new Song, upon account of the joyful Occasion of it, the Lamb's taking the Book, and opening the Seals thereof; and upon account of the new Transports of Devotion, with which they raised the Song, upon such a wonderful Revelation. And the Redeemed are fitly represented as beginning the Song, and leading in it; for they are most nearly concern'd. And then the Angels join in Consort with them, and with united Voice shout forth the Praises of the Son of God, in the Words which I have chosen for my Text, <HI>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain—.</HI> Here is a <HI>loud Voice</HI> attributed to the Angels, and perfected Spirits; for tho' the Angels have not bo∣dily Organs of Speech as we, and the Saints have not, the most of them, as yet receiv'd their Bodies glo∣rified; yet have they the most excellent Way of u∣niting in the Worship of God, and expressing their high Praises to him. We read of the <HI>Tongues of Angels,</HI> and when the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> was caught up to the third Heaven, he heard <HI>unspeakable Words</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 13. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the Words we may observe, 1. Our Lord Je∣sus Christ is the Lamb that was slain. 2. He is worthy to receive Power, and Riches, and Wisdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Blessing.</P>
<P N="1">1. DOCT. <HI>Our Lord Jesus Christ is the Lamb that was slain.</HI> 1. He is the Lamb. 2. He was slain.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="005685_0005_1026BF80D88C2E00"/>1. <HI>Our Lord Jesus Christ is the Lamb.</HI> He is such by way of Eminency, The Lambs used in Sa∣crifice of Old, were but shadowy Emblems and Types of him, who is the Lamb of God. Here we may consider, upon what Accounts Christ may be compared to a Lamb. I shall but just Hint at two or three Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Our Lord Jesus may be compared to a Lamb <HI>for his Purity, Innocence and Usefulness.</HI> The Lamb is a cleanly inoffensive Creature, and so fit to re∣semble him who is <HI>holy, harmless and undefiled,</HI> Heb. 7.6. He was not shapen in Iniquity, as we were. No, the Child Jesus was conceived in the Womb of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> by the Power of the Holy Ghost, and consequent upon this, it is said to her, <HI>That holy Thing which shall be born of thee, shall be called the Son of God,</HI> Luke 1.35. This Lamb was without Blemish in the perfect Rectitude of his Nature, and in his Life and Conversation. He did no Evil, nor was Guile found in his Mouth. And he is most useful and profitable to all that obtain an Interest in him: They have in him the choicest Food, of Virtue to nourish them to eternal Life; and cloath∣ing that excells the purest and finest Wool, the Robes of his perfect Righteousness.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our Lord Jesus may be compar'd to a Lamb for his <HI>Meekness and Silence under Sufferings.</HI> The brute Creatures are not capable of moral Vertues, however there is such a Resemblance of these even in some of them, that God in his Word is pleased to make use of them in Comparisons. Mat, 10.16.
<PB N="9" REF="005685_0006_1026BF825E8C7710"/>
<HI>Be ye therefore wise as Serpents, and harmless as Doves.</HI> Now the Lamb is a lively Emblem of Meekness; gentle, &amp; free from Fierceness, &amp; goeth to the Slaugh∣ter without that Noise and Resistance which some other Creatures make. Thus Jesus under the hea∣viest Sufferings, neither murmured against God, nor reviled Men; but silently and quietly bore that Punishment which was due to his People for their Iniquities, Isai. 53.7. <HI>He is brought as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep before her Shearers is dumb, so he opened not his Mouth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And it may be principally, <HI>because he is the great Antitype, who was offered to God in Sacrifice once for all.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sin of the World,</HI> John 1.29. In this Allusion there seems to be an especial Reference to those Sacrifices which were offered to God under the Levitical Dispensa∣tion, and did prefigure Jesus Christ particularly, to the <HI>Lambs</HI> which were frequently offered to God as bloody Sacrifices. The daily Sacrifices offer'd Morn∣ing and Evening, were <HI>two Lambs,</HI> Exod. 29. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8. And the <HI>paschal Lamb</HI> did in an eminent Manner typify Jesus Christ our <HI>Passover,</HI> 1 Cor. 5.7.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Our Lord Jesus Christ was slain.</HI></P>
<P>As the Sacrifices under the Law were kill'd, ha∣ving their Blood, which is their Life, pour'd out at the Altar: So our Lord Jesus was smitten with the Sword of Justice, and his Blood was shed on the Cross, when he gave his Life a Ransom for many. No less a Price than the Blood of him who is God,
<PB N="10" REF="005685_0007_1026BF8603AD8F10"/>
was sufficient for the Redemption of his People, <HI>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible Things, as Sil∣ver and Gold, from your vain Conversation received by Tradition from your Fathers; but with the pre∣cious Blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without Blemish and without Spot.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. DOCT. <HI>The Lord Jesus, the Lamb slain, is worthy to receive Power, and Riches, and Wisdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Blessing.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. In what Respects, and upon what Accounts may our Lord be said to be worthy of what is here ascribed to him? 2. We may enumerate the seve∣ral Particulars, and shew that our Lord is worthy of all and every one of them.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>In what Respects, and upon what Accounts may our Lord be said to be worthy of what is here ascribed to him?</HI></P>
<P>Now in general, I may answer, He is worthy in a strict and proper Sense, upon account of the infi∣nite Dignity of his Person, as the Son of God; and upon account of the Merit of his Obedience as God-Man Mediator.</P>
<P N="1">I. Our Lord Jesus is worthy of this Ascription of Praise <HI>upon account of the infinite Dignity of his Person?</HI></P>
<P>As he is the Son of God, the second Person in the sacred Trinity, he is the Brightness of the Fa∣ther's Glory, and is worthy to be glorified as God. The Name of God is in him, and he is one with the Father in the essential Perfections of the divine
<PB N="11" REF="005685_0008_1026BF887AE71230"/>
Nature. <HI>I and my Father are One,</HI> John 10.30. His infinite Excellencies demand this religious Ado∣ration, and he must be worthy to receive this Doxo∣logy and Ascription of Praise from the heavenly Quire. And indeed this may be said to be the Ground and Foundation of all; however the next Reason and Motive here seem to be his perfect O∣bedience as Mediator, to which his divine Nature communicates infinite Worth and Value; so that he purchased the Church with his own Blood, a compleat Deliverance from all the Evil of Sin, and the full Enjoyment of God for ever in Heaven; which leads me to the second Thing,</P>
<P N="2">2. The Lord Jesus is worthy of this <HI>as God-Man Mediator, having finished the Work which God gave him to do upon Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord, when expiring on the Cross, said, <HI>It is finished</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 19.30.</NOTE>. And accordingly in his wonderful Prayer to his Father, he hath these Words, <HI>I have glorified thee on the Earth: I have finished the Work which thou gavest me to do. And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self, with the Glory which I had with thee before the World was,</HI> John 17.4, 5. The Lord Jesus having fulfill'd his Fa∣ther's Will on Earth by his active and passive Obe∣dience, is worthy to receive the full Reward. Phil. 2.6,—11. <HI>Who being in the Form of God, thought it not Robbery to be equal with God: But made him∣self of no Reputation, and took upon him the Form of a Servant, and was made in the Likeness of Men. And being found in Fashion as a Man, he humbled
<PB N="12" REF="005685_0009_1026BF8BF0D9AD20"/>
himself, and became obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross. Wherefore God hath also highly exalted him, and given him a Name which is above every Name: That at the Name of Jesus every Knee should bow, of Things in Heaven, and Things in Earth, and Things under the Earth: And that every Tongue should confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</HI> The Son of God may now, as the Head of the Church, challenge all Power, Riches and Glory; whatever is needful to perfect the Glory of his exalted State, and to put him into a Capacity to bestow on his People all the Benefits of that eternal Redemption which he has purchased. And he has accordingly receiv'd the Promise of the Father, the Gift of the Holy Ghost, called here <HI>the seven Spirits of God,</HI> v. 6. upon account of his ma∣nifold and perfect Operations.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>We may enumerate the several Particulars, and shew that our Lord Jesus is worthy to receive all and every one of them.</HI></P>
<P>Now when it is said that our Lord is worthy to receive Power, <HI>&amp;c. Beza</HI> gives this as the Meaning of the Place, He is worthy to whom all Praise should be given as the most powerful, wise— I shall consider the Words as they lie in the Text.</P>
<P N="1">I. Our Lord Jesus is worthy to receive <HI>Power.</HI></P>
<P>The Lamb slain deserves to be celebrated, and re∣ceive all Praise as one most powerful. The Word here used signifies Power, Fortitude. "Authority over all, says a judicious Expositor. He is <HI>the Al∣mighty,</HI> Rev. 1.8. As God he must be infinite in Power, and as the Creator and Upholder of all
<PB N="13" REF="005685_0010_1026BF8E68DACD20"/>
Things, he must have a Right to universal Domi∣nion. <HI>Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever,</HI> Rom. 9.5. But we are now speaking of his Power as God-Man Mediator. Now look upon him in this Character, and he receiveth his Power as a Gift from the Father. <HI>All Power is given un∣to me in Heaven and in Earth,</HI> Matth. 28.18. No mere Creature is worthy to receive universal Em∣pire; to be King over all. But Jesus is worthy to receive Power and Dominion over all Creatures, both in Heaven and Earth. And this mediatorial Kingdom is given him as a Reward of his infinite Condescention in his Humiliation, and with an espe∣cial Regard to the Salvation of his People.—<HI>And set him at his own right Hand in the heavenly Places: Far above all Principality, and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every Name that is named, not only in this World, but also in that which to come: And hath put all Things under his Feet, and gave him to be the Head over all Things to the Church,</HI> Eph. 1.20,—22. <HI>Angels,</HI> even the highest Order of them, Thrones and Dominions, are most willing∣ly subject to him, and fulfill his Pleasure; they are all <HI>ministring Sprits</HI> under him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 1.14.</NOTE>. Yea, the <HI>Devils</HI> are forcibly bro't under his Power, and he controuls them according to his sovereign Will. While on Earth, he cast them out of the possessed, and will in due Time shut them up in the bottomless Pit. There's a burning Hell prepar'd for the Devil, and his Angels. Our Lord also rules among the <HI>Inha∣bitants of the Earth,</HI> and disposeth of Kingdoms and Countries according to his Will. <HI>By him Kings
<PB N="14" REF="005685_0011_1026BF900FBB05F8"/>
reign, and Princes decree Justice.</HI> He makes Ru∣lers Benefactors to their People, or permits Tyrants to oppress them in his holy Displeasure. He makes Peace, or draws the Sword of War. He gives Health, or sends wasting Diseases. In a Word, He rules in the Midst of his Enemies, and when he plea∣seth, makes them his willing People in the Day of his Power. He sets up his spiritual Kingdom when and where he pleaseth, giving his Covenant-People the Laws and Ordinances of his House, and be∣stowing the saving Blessings of this Kingdom on all his faithful People, who by his Word and Spirit are made willing to submit to him as their Prince and Saviour. Yea, he has the lower Orders of Creatures put under him, the Beasts of the Field, the Fowl of the Air, and the Fish of the Sea. And even the Winds and the Seas obey him. And this his me∣diatorial Kingdom must abide 'till all the glorious Ends of it are accomplished. <HI>He must reign till he hath put all Enemies under his Feet,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.25. Even the last Enemy, Death, shall be destroy'd, when he shall appear in the great Day of Judgment to the Salvation of his People; and after the Work of that Day is done, conduct them to the King∣dom of Glory. Surely our Lord is then worthy to be praised as the most powerful, his Dominion ruleth over all, and he is every Way equal to this high Office. He is <HI>the blssed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Our Lord Jesus is worthy to receive <HI>Riches.</HI></P>
<P>None may in this Respect be compar'd with him. The Riches of the whole World are his. Earthly Princes may have a Right to govern; but this doth
<PB N="15" REF="005685_0012_1026BF925CFA3680"/>
not give them the Property and Possession of the E∣states of their Subjects. But now, the Lord Jesus has the full Possession of all Things in Heaven and Earth, of all Riches, whether temporal or spiritual. He is the high Possessor of Heaven and Earth. All Things are Christ's, and so his People have a Right to them according as he sees them needful and pro∣per for them. <HI>Whether</HI> Paul, <HI>or</HI> Apollo, <HI>or</HI> Cephas, <HI>or the World, or Life, or Death, or Things present, or Things to come, all are yours. And ye are Christs,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.22, 23. All being in his Hand, he com∣municates Grace and Glory, and every good Thing to his People. Agreeably the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> says to the <HI>Philippians, My God shall supply all your Need according to his Riches in Glory, by Christ Jesus,</HI> 4 c. 19. We read of Christ that <HI>he was rich,</HI> 2. Cor. 8.9. Indeed he became <HI>poor,</HI> had not where to lay his Head; but then this was that he might pur∣chase all Riches for his People; And now it has pleased the Father that <HI>in him should all Fulness dwell,</HI> Col. 1.19. As Mediator, our Lord inherits all Things. The <HI>Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulness thereof,</HI> Psal. 24. And so is the Abundance of the Seas, and Treasures hid in the Sand. And he gives these Things to whom he will, a large Portion of∣tentimes to the Men of this World. And tho' his Followers are not seldom of the poor of this World, yet we must remember, that the little they enjoy is better to them than the Abundance of many Wick∣ed; for their Saviour gives Meat to them, as be∣ing mindful of his Covenant; and bestows infinite∣ly better Things, they are rich in Faith, and Heirs of the Kingdom. Which brings me to say, that all <HI>spiritual Riches,</HI> the Riches of Grace and Glory
<PB N="16" REF="005685_0013_1026BF95D9862248"/>
are Christ's. And accordingly he invites them that are convinced of their spiritual Poverty, to come to him for <HI>Gold tried in the Fire, that they may be rich,</HI> Rev. 3.18. And promiseth, that he will cause them that love him to <HI>inherit Substance,</HI> and that he will <HI>fill their Treasures,</HI> Prov. 8.21. What an inexhaustible Stock of Merit is laid up in him, in whom God declares his <HI>Righteousness</HI> for the Re∣mission of Sins, the many and great Transgressions of all true Believers! What inexhaustible Stores of Grace are treasur'd up in him, thro' whom God makes all Grace abound towards his People, and enricheth them with every good and perfect Gift! All the Riches of the Kingdom of Heaven are his. We read of the <HI>holy Jerusalem,</HI> descending out of Heaven from God, that the City was pure Gold—the Foundation of the Wall garnish'd with all Man∣ner of precious Stones, the Gates twelve Pearls, the Street pure Gold, <HI>Rev.</HI> 21. What Riches are here shadow'd out to us by Metaphors taken from the most costly and precious Things of this Life? And if this hath a next Reference to a glorious Church State upon Earth, the Argument riseth from the less to the greater. What an immense Treasure is laid up for God's People in Heaven! Upon which they shall live most gloriously and happily, becom∣ing the Children of the Kingdom, and that for ever and ever. And yet all this is a purchased Possession, bought with the Blood of Christ, and by him free∣ly bestowed on them. <HI>Come, ye blessed of my Fa∣ther, inherit the Kingdom.</HI> Well may the Riches of Christ be called <HI>unsearchable Riches;</HI> well may we ascribe Praise to him as the most wealthy, who is appointed <HI>Heir of all Things,</HI> Eph. 5.8. Heb. 1.2.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="17" REF="005685_0014_1026BF9976C14DB0"/>3. Our Lord Jesus Christ is worthy to receive <HI>Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>Behold! a greater than <HI>Solomon,</HI> in Wisdom. He who is the Lamb slain, is <HI>the only wise God,</HI> and none may be compar'd with him, in this Respect. <HI>In him are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Know∣ledge,</HI> Col. 2.3. He is the <HI>Wisdom of God,</HI> Luke 11.49. Look upon him as the <HI>Creator</HI> of all Things, in Wisdom has he made them all. And all created Wisdom is as nothing compar'd with his, <HI>His Angels he chargeth with Folly,</HI> Job 4.18. Look upon him as the <HI>Ruler</HI> of all Things, his Know∣ledge and Wisdom are every Way equal to the vast Extent of his Government. Our Lord is perfectly acquainted with all Things in Heaven and Earth, and need not, as earthly Princes, see with other Men's Eyes. Nor is it possible that he should be chargeable with any Oversight in the Administra∣tion of Government. His Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, and all Things are open before him. <HI>Hell is naked before him, and Destruction hath no Covering,</HI> Job 26.6. So that there is no Place in which his Enemies may hide themselves from him; nor is there any Wisdom or Counsel that can prevail a∣gainst him. Our Lord bruiseth the Serpent's Head, turns the Counsels of the most crafty <HI>Ahithophel's</HI> into Foolishness, and over-rules their deepest laid Plots to their own Confusion, and the Advancement of his Kingdom. Well may our Lord say, as Prov. 8.14. <HI>Counsel is mine, and sound Wisdom: I am Understanding.</HI> And if you consider him as the <HI>Re∣deemer</HI> of his People, God has in him abounded to∣wards us in all Wisdom and Prudence. In the Contrivance and effecting our Redemption by Jesus
<PB N="18" REF="005685_0015_1026BF9B143FE620"/>
Christ, we behold the manifold Wisdom of God, and may well cry out, in the highest Admiration, as Rom. 11.33, 34. <HI>O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God! How unsearch∣able are his Judgments, and his Ways past finding out? For who hath known the Mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Counseller?</HI> This great and most difficult Work was committed to Christ, and he ne∣ver made the least Mistake in the Discharge of it: He acts in this most important affair for the highest and most worthy End, by the most suitable and suf∣ficient Means, and carries on the Work with un∣erring Wisdom, thro' a thousand opposing Difficul∣ties, and that so as to overcome them all. Surely that Prophecy was eminently fulfill'd in him, Isai, 11.2, 3. <HI>The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the Spirit of Wisdom and Understanding, the Spirit of Counsel and Might, the Spirit of Knowledge, and of the Fear of the Lord: And shall make him of quick Understanding in the Fear of the Lord.</HI> His Name is justly called <HI>wonderful Counseller.</HI> Indeed all Wisdom is in him as Light in the Sun, and he hath in all Ages communicated it to his Church and Peo∣ple, as was necessary to make them wise to Salvati∣on; till the Day spring from on high visited them in the Light of the glorious Gospel. He is of God <HI>made</HI> to his People <HI>Wisdom.</HI> And we have him fit∣ly represented to <HI>John</HI> in the Context, as having <HI>se∣ven Eyes,</HI> v. 6. The Perfection of Wisdom and Knowledge to make known all God's Counsels re∣lating to the Salvation of his People, and order all the Affairs of his Church in the best Manner, 'till he shall present it to himself a <HI>glorious Church,</HI> not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any such Thing. We
<PB N="19" REF="005685_0016_10269231AB5B9C00"/>
see here, that as our exalted Redeemer he is worthy to receive the Revelation of God's Purposes concern∣ing his Church, even to the End of Time, and to communicate them, 9th v. He is worthy as the Lamb that was slain. "It argueth, says Dr. <HI>Good∣win,</HI> that this Book of the Revelation is an especial Fruit of his Death.</P>
<P N="4">4. Our Lord Jesus Christ is worthy to receive <HI>Strength.</HI></P>
<P>He is worthy to be praised as the most Mighty. The Child born, and Son given to God's People, is <HI>the mighty God</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. 9.6.</NOTE>. This is one of the Names whereby he is called. I am sensible that the Word here used is near in Signification with the former, translated <HI>Power.</HI> I shall now consider it as Strength united with Authority to sustain the great Burden of Government, and to effect all the glorious Designs of his universal Dominion. The Son of God hath the infinite Power of the Godhead to uphold him; so that none can stay his Hand, or say unto him, What doest thou. He works, and none can hinder him. This mighty One holds all Events in his Hand, acting above second Causes, or contrary to the ordinary Course of them, at his Pleasure; so that <HI>the Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong, neither yet Bread to the Wise, nor yet Riches to Men of Understanding, nor yet Favour to Men of Skill, but Time and Chance happeneth to them all,</HI> Eccl. 9.11. All Creatures are as nothing when set in Opposition against him. We read, He shall feed his Flock like a Shepherd—, and then follows,
<PB N="20" REF="005685_0017_1026BF9CC7ABF958"/>
who hath measured the Waters in the Hollow of his Hand, who hath weighed the Mountains in Scales, and the Hills in a Balance? Behold the Nations are as a Drop of a Bucket, and are counted as the small Dust of the Balance: Behold he taketh up the Isles as a very little Thing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 19.11,—20.</NOTE>. What an Idea doth this give us of his vast Strength! Surely there can be no Restraint of the Lord to save by many, or by few, for all Nations are as nothing before him, as the Dust of the Balance, of no Weight, and blown away with the least Breath. The Kings of the Earth become weak as other Men, when sepa∣rated from their Subjects; but the Strength of Christ is in himself, infinite. He doth not make use of Instruments because he stands in Need of them; but because he would put Honour upon his Crea∣tures. Our Lord is represented as coming from <HI>E∣dom,</HI> the Land of his Enemies, travelling in the Greatness of his Strength, his Garments stain'd with the Blood of his Enemies: And he says, <HI>I have trodden the Wine-press alone,</HI> I will tread them in mine Anger—<HI>Mine own Arm brought Salvation</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. 63.1,—6.</NOTE>. And then <HI>John</HI> in Vision saw him ride forth against his Enemies, the Armies which were in Heaven following him; still the Power and Victory are his, and so great is the Slaughter that the Fowls of Hea∣ven are invited to come and eat the Flesh of Kings, and of Captains, and of mighty Men, and of all Men, both free and bond, small and great: Yea, he will destroy these Enemies, the Devil and his Ad∣herents, by casting them into the Lake of Fire, where they shall be tormented for ever and ever <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 19.11,—20.</NOTE>.

If that Inquiry therefore be made, <HI>Who is this King of Glory?</HI> The Answer must be, <HI>The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in Battle,</HI> Psal. 24.8. The most powerful of our Lord's, and his Church's Enemies are as nothing in his Hand, he can destroy them with more Ease than we can move a Finger. <HI>Thy right Hand, O Lord, is become glorious in Power; thy right Hand, O Lord, hath dashed in Pieces the Enemy,</HI> Exod. 15.6. Agreeably he is represented to <HI>John</HI> in the Context, v. 6. as having <HI>seven Horns,</HI> emblems of Strength, and that in Perfection. And then our Lord's Strength reacheth beyond all humane Force, to change and subdue the Hearts of Men. The most mighty <HI>Monarchs</HI> can command only the Obedience of the outward Man. But here's a King that sets up his Kingdom in the Hearts of his Subjects. When he rides forth conquering and to conquer, the most stubborn and obstinate Sinners fall down under him, and being renew'd by his Spi∣rit, have his Laws written on their Hearts. Psal. 45.3,—5. <HI>Gird thy Sword upon thy Thigh, O most Mighty: With thy Glory and thy Majesty. And in thy Majesty ride prosperously, because of Truth and Meekness, and Righteousness: And thy right Hand shall teach thee terrible Things. Thine Arrows are sharp in the Heart of the King's Enemies: Whereby the People fall under thee.</HI> Psal. 110.2, 3. <HI>The Lord shall send the Rod of thy Strength out of Zion: Rule thou in the midst of thine Enemies. Thy Peo∣ple shall be willing in the Day of thy Power.</HI> He may with the greatest Propriety challenge the Title of <HI>Invincible;</HI> and in him Might and Right are united in the most harmonious Agreement: He never abus'd his Strength to oppress, <HI>the Sceptre of
<PB N="22" REF="005685_0019_1026BFA3CBBEC278"/>
his Kingdom is a right Sceptre; he loveth Righteous∣ness, and hateth Wickedness,</HI> Psal. 45.6, 7. Certain∣ly then our Lord deserves to be praised as the most Mighty.</P>
<P N="5">5. Our Lord Jesus Christ is worthy to receive <HI>Honour, and Glory, and Blessing.</HI></P>
<P>I put these together. Our Lord deserveth these upon the Account of his infinite Excellencies, and the Display he has made of them in his wonderful Works, particularly this great Work of our Redemp∣tion; and may demand, as his Due, that Honour and Glory which are incommunicable to the highest Order of Creatures. When he is brought into the World, the Command is given, <HI>Let all the Angels of God worship him,</HI> Heb. 1.6. And now, <HI>We see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the suffering of Death, crown'd with Glory and Honour,</HI> Heb. 2.9. Yea, made higher than the Heavens, c. 7. v. 26. And <HI>the Father judgeth no Man: But hath committed all Judgment to the Son: That all Men should honour the Son, even as they ho∣nour the Father,</HI> John 5.22, 23. The Angels and glorified Spirits adore him, casting down their Crowns before him. We need not here critically examine into the Distinction between Honour and Glory; they comprehend that glorious Dignity which our Lord is advanc'd to at the right Hand of God, and that high Esteem and Devotion, together with all the Expressions of them, which he has in the heavenly World. And the Son of God must be worthy of all this, in that he is the Brightness of the Fa∣ther's Glory, and <HI>the express Image of his Person,</HI> Heb. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. and yet vailed his Glory for a Time in the deepest Abasement, that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People might be
<PB N="23" REF="005685_0020_1026BFA585BAFEC8"/>
glorified with him. Upon which we here upon Earth also have the highest Reason to fall down before him and say, Blessed be thy glorious Name, which is exalted above all Blessing and Praise. Which brings me to the last Ascription, <HI>and Blessing.</HI> Our Lord Jesus is most worthy to be spoken well of by his People, and to receive Blessing from them upon account of the wonderful Manifestations of his espe∣cial Goodness and Favour to them. They are all blessed in him, and shall enjoy the Fulness of Bles∣sing in the heavenly Places forever. Now, as <HI>One</HI> observeth, <Q> Blessing respects that Glory, which for his special Goodness to them, his Saints do give him. Others do give Honour to Christ, but not Blessing: That the Saints only give; for that Re∣spects in God the Communication of Goodness. They only bless him whom he blesseth first.</Q> Thus he. All our Lord's Works praise him, his Saints bless him. And thus I have reckon'd up, and in some imperfect Manner consider'd, the par∣ticular Heads which compose this Doxology. It is Time that I improve the Doctrines.</P>

<P>USE 1. We have here <HI>an undeniable Proof of the Divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Our Lord could not be worthy to receive this Ascription of Praise from Angels and Men, was he not God as well as Man. We may not say to any meer Creature, no not to the highest Angel in Heaven, Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory. And yet we see here, that the holy Angels, and Spirits of just Men made perfect, who behold the Lamb of

God in the Light of Glory, give him this divine Honour. Surely these blessed Inhabitants of Hea∣ven are not guilty of Idolatry. Yea, <Q>this Doxo∣logy thus begun by the Church, and carried on by the Angels, is resounded and echoed by the whole Creation. And the Church that begun the heavenly Anthem, closeth all with their <HI>A∣men.</HI> </Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HENRY.</NOTE> Rev. 5.13, 14. <HI>And every Creature which is in Heaven, and on the Earth, and under the Earth, and such as are in the Sea, and all that are in them, heard I, saying, Blessing, Honour, Glory and Power, be unto him that sitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. And the four Beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty Elders fell down, and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>USE 2. Learn that our Lord Jesus hath <HI>all divine Perfections to command our firmest Trust, highest E∣steem, and strongest Love.</HI></P>
<P>He is infinitely excellent and glorious. The Al∣mighty, and therefore able to save to the uttermost. He is laid in <HI>Zion</HI> for a <HI>sure Foundation,</HI> a chief Corner-stone; <HI>and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</HI> If we build our Hopes of Happiness on him, we way raise them as high as the highest Heaven, the Foundation is every Way sufficient to bear such a Superstructure. Col. 1.27. <HI>Christ in you, the Hope of Glory.</HI> The Man is cursed that trusteth in Man, and maketh Flesh his Arm: The Man is blessed that trusteth in the Lord, and whose Hope the Lord is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. 17.5,—7.</NOTE>. And surely this glorious Per∣son
<PB N="25" REF="005685_0022_1026BFAB40F452E0"/>
is worthy of our highest Esteem and strongest Affection. All amiable Qualities and Perfections meet in him as Lines in their Centre, and are in him after an eminent Manner and transeendent De∣gree. <HI>He is the Chief among ten Thousand, and al∣together lovely</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. 5.10,—16.</NOTE>. Let us then take off our Eyes from beholding the vain Objects of this World, and fix them on him who deserves to be loved, with all the Heart, and with all the Soul, and Mind, and Strength; and has in the most endearing Manner recommended himself to us by his redeeming Love, as he is the Lamb that was slain. O let us behold and consider him 'till we can each one of us say, <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And there is none upon Earth that I desire besides thee.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Learn that <HI>they are unworthy of Christ who are not willing to forsake their Lusts, and all for him.</HI></P>
<P>We can't receive and accept of Christ in any Measure becoming his Worth, unless we are wil∣ling to lay down all our Interests at his Feet, and give up ourselves entirely to him. If any Lust be too dear to part with for Christ, any outward En∣joyment too good in our Account, to be left for him, we don't come up to those Terms which his infinite Merit demands of us as highly reasonable, and his Gospel obligeth us to. Matth. 10.37, 38. <HI>He that loveth Father or Mother more than me, is not worthy of me; and he that loveth Son or Daugh∣ter more than me, is not worthy of me. And he that taketh not his Cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</HI> Indeed it is impossible that we should
<PB N="26" REF="005685_0023_1026BFAEA9AF8240"/>
be in a strict Sense worthy of Christ, or in the least Measure merit this unspeakable Gift; but then we are not in the Gospel Sense meet for it while we hold fast our Iniquity, or idolize any Creature Com∣fort; as we do, if we suffer them to stand in Com∣petition with Christ for our Hearts. O let us then cry to God to cast down every Idol of Jealousy in us, that our Hearts may be perfect in closing with the Lord Jesus. We can't serve God, and Mammon.</P>
<P N="4">4. What hath been said <HI>should encourage God's Peo∣ple to go to the Throne of Grace, to ask of God all the Blessings they need; and excite them to continue instant in Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>When we reflect on our own Sinfulness and great Unworthiness, our Hands may be ready to hang down, and our Hearts to fail. But O People of God! pour out your Hearts before him, and open your Mouths in enlarged Desires; for worthy is the Lamb that was slain. This glorious Person, whom God delights to Honour, is your Advocate with the Father, and lives in Heaven to make Intercession for you; and you may therefore approach the Presence of God with humble Confidence, while you ask in the Name of Christ, John 16.23, 24. <HI>Verily, ve∣rily, I say unto you, What soever ye shall ask the Fa∣ther in my Name, he will give it you. Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my Name: Ask, and ye shall receive, that your Joy may be full.</HI> Let us draw nigh to God then in the full Assurance of Faith, having our entire Dependence on the Merits of our exalted Redeemer, who offers much Incense with the Prayers of the Saints, <HI>Rev,</HI> 3.8. and has Power as a Priest on a Throne, to demand all the Blessings which his
<PB N="27" REF="005685_0024_1026BFB13024FF38"/>
Church and People need, the just Reward of his Obedience unto Death, John 17.2. <HI>Father, I will that they also which thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory which thou hast given me.</HI> And I trust that the surprizing Joy of God's Salvation given us this Day is in An∣swer to our Prayers. We have in a public and so∣lemn Manner, as well as more privately, committed that important Affair of the Expedition unto God in the Name of our Lord Jesus, and I humbly hope that our Lord has pleaded our Cause in the Court of Heaven against his and our Enemies, and sent us Help from his holy Place; so that we may say with the royal Psalmist, <HI>In my Distress I called upon the Lord, he heard my Voice out of his Temple:</HI> Let us then resolve that we will call upon him as long as we live. An <HI>excellent Divine</HI> suggests a good Tho't to encourage us, who live in the last Ages of the World, to continue instant and servent in Prayer; for "tho' we are weak, yet praying in the Strength of all the Saints Prayers, and of their Blood, we must needs be heard." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. T. GOODWIN.</NOTE> Many have been the Prayers of God's People gone up against Antichrist: Let us be encouraged to pray the more earnestly for his utter Destruction.

<P N="5">5. Let what hath been said <HI>prevail with us to open our Hearts to Christ, and to receive him upon Gospel Terms.</HI></P>
<P>Behold! Our ascended Saviour stands at the Door of our Hearts, and knocks; and his Voice to us is,
<PB N="28" REF="005685_0025_1026BFB2C9DE88F8"/>
<HI>Open to me. Lift up your Heads, O ye Gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlasting Doors, and the King of Glory shall come in</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. 24.7.</NOTE>. O let not any despise this most gracious Offer, and neglect so great Salvation! Know it, you must submit to Christ's golden Scep∣tre, or be broken to Pieces by his Iron Rod, when he shall be revealed from Heaven in flaming Fire, taking Vengeance on them that obey not his Gos∣pel. We read, Rev. 6.15,—17. <HI>And the Kings of the Earth, and the great Men, and the rich Men, and the chief Captains, and the mighty Men, and e∣very Bondman, and every Freeman hid themselves in the Dens, and in the Rocks of the Mountains, and said to the Mountains and Rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the Face of him that sitteth on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb: For the great Day of his Wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?</HI> Be wise therefore, O ye Kings; be instruc∣ted ye Judges of the Earth. Kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish from the Way, when his Wrath is kindled but a little: Blessed are they that put their Trust in him. O seek his Spirit then to work Faith and other Graces in you! If you give up your selves to him, Christ will become your's forever; his Power will be your's, to strengthen and protect you, his Wisdom your's to guide and lead you, his Riches yours, to supply all your Wants. In a Word, by receiving him you will have Power to become the Children of God, and if Children then Heirs, Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Je∣sus Christ. And having overcome by the Blood of the Lamb, you shall sit down with him in his
<PB N="29" REF="005685_0026_1026BFB663E846A8"/>
Throne, even as he also overcame, and is set down with his Father in his Throne.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Let us all adore the Son of God, and say, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wisdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Blessing.</HI></P>
<P>Let us in this Manner worship him upon Earth, as the Angels and perfected Spirits do in Heaven. The Son of God hath taken to him not the Nature of Angels, but the Seed of <HI>Abraham;</HI> he has re∣deem'd us to God by his Blood, not them. Let us then awake our Glory, sing and give praise to the great God our Saviour. He deserves to be struck dumb, or rather to roar out under the intollerable Plagues of the Damned in Hell, who refuseth to join in ascribing Honour and Glory and Blessing to God, and to the Lamb. And tho' we are but as Chil∣dren in this imperfect State, who can only lisp and stammer in this heavenly Exercise; yet let us re∣member that our Lord inhabits the Praises of his <HI>Israel,</HI> and can ordain the Praise of his Strength out of the Mouth of Babes, that he may still the Enemy and the Avenger.</P>
<P>In a particular Manner, Let us praise our Lord Jesus, the Captain of the Lord's Hosts, who by his di∣vine Wisdom and Power has led his People into the strong City, the <HI>romish Edom;</HI> and triumph'd gloriously over his and our antichristian Enemies. O People highly favour'd of the Lord! Bow down and adoring say, <HI>Thine, O Lord, is the Greatness, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory, and the Majesty</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. 11.29.</NOTE>. In∣deed,
<PB N="30" REF="005685_0027_1026BFB8F85E11A8"/>
it would be an Injury, but far from us, to with∣hold civil Praise due to our valiant Commanders and Soldiers, whom the Lord has us'd and honour'd, as his Instruments in this wonderful Work. However, en∣tirely consistent with this, we now sing to the Lord, for he has done marvellous Things. <HI>His right Hand, and holy Arm hath gotten him the Victory. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name give Glory.</HI> And indeed if we observe the Footsteps of God's Providence plainly appearing in this great Affair, we shall be constrain'd to say, <HI>This is the Lord's Doing, it is marvellous in our Eyes.</HI> Give me leave then just to mention some remarkable Providences by which God formed this important Enterprize, and crown'd it with Success in such a Manner as to re∣serve the Honour to himself. As in over-ruling the Views and Determinations of our honoured Fathers in the civil Government, and then in giving them such remarkable Assistances in managing a Business in a Manner new, and attended with many Difficulties: In spiriting so many effective Men to offer themselves speedily as Voluntiers in this hazardous Enterprize: In the very uncommon Moderation of the Winter and Continuance of fair Weather, whereby a favou∣rable Opportunity was given of expediting this arduous Affair, in equipping Ships of War with Transports in a short Time: In preserving us from the Small-Pox, when awfully threatned near the Time of embarking: In giving such a safe and prosperous Voyage: In sending so seasonably to our Help a Number of his Majesty's Ships of War needful to prevent Succours going to the Enemy, and to defend us by Sea: In ordering the Weather so favourable for the Landing our Forces on the Enemy's Shore,
<PB N="31" REF="005685_0028_1026BFBAB256EEB0"/>
and for transporting our Artillery by Land: In the great Security in which our Enemies were surpriz'd by the formidable Approach of our Fleet, and sud∣den landing; and their consequent contemptible Opposition, which rather turn'd to our Advantage, and against themselves. Behold! they flee with Loss, and intimidated precipitantly desert their Grand Battery, and give it up to us; and thus some of their heaviest Cannon are turn'd against themselves: And in this Way did our good God encourage his People with the Joy of his Salvation, even upon their first Landing, an Earnest of what he would further do for them. In delivering up some of our Ene∣my's Ships into our Hands, especially that large Ship of War so full of Men and Stores, that had she forc'd her Way in the Fog, our Enterprize might have been defeated; but God forbid it. In pre∣serving or restoring such Measures of Health; and animating our Officers and Soldiers, tho' hitherto unacquainted with such Difficulties, to attend the Duties and bear the Fatigues and Hazards of a Siege, and this under the Trial of some awful Providences. In maintaining such an Harmony betwen our pru∣dent and valiant General PEPPERRELL, and the brave Commodore WARREN, the contrary to which has proved fatal to Expeditions carried on by Land and Sea. In directing and helping our unexpe∣rienc'd Soldiers so speedily and dextrously to raise their Batteries against the Town, and Island Fort; and then to play their Cannon and Mortars with such Skill and Success that the Town is greatly dis∣tress'd, and the Island Battery soon made too hot for the Besieged, they take to the Water for some Relief. And to crown all, in inclining the Enemy
<PB N="32" REF="005685_0029_1026BFBD622B6408"/>
to surrender the Day before a general Assault was to have been made by Land and Sea, which must in all Probability have cost many precious Lives, and the Event have been doubtful. Whereas now, by the good Hand of God upon us, we have a City strongly fortified by Nature and Art, deliver'd up without any great Effusion of Blood, our own or our Enemies, which must have cast a Damp even upon the Joy of Victory. Blessed be God the Pre∣server of Men! And thus has the God of Victory in a short Time given us the Labours of many Years, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Our Forces landed on the Island of <HI>Cape-Breton, April</HI> 30th and <HI>May</HI> 1st. 1745. And the City of <HI>Louisbourg,</HI> with the whole Island, was surrender'd to us, <HI>June</HI> 17th following.</NOTE> a Place of great Importance with Regard to the Safety of our Navigation and Improvement of our Fishery, and which we hope will be a Curb to restrain our incroaching Enemies. And by this Expedition God has also defeated the Attempts of our Enemies against <HI>Annapolis,</HI> which had they suc∣ceeded a Way might have been opened for them to invade us on our Frontiers. And God has also hitherto most graciously preserv'd us from the In∣cursions of our Enemies. Let us then ascribe Ho∣nour and Glory and Blessing to our Lord strong and mighty. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! who hath given to his <HI>Son the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the uttermost Parts of the Earth for his Possession!</HI> Blessed be the Son of God! who has asserted his own Right in turn∣ing out his and our Enemies.

May the Son of God receive divine Honour as the only Mediator between God and Man, and neither Angels nor Saints be admitted to share with him in his incommunicable Glories. May the Righteous∣ness of Christ, and that only, be publish'd as the me∣ritorious Cause of our Justification before God, and the pernicious Doctrine of the Merit of our Works disappear as the Shades of Night, before the rising of this Sun of Righteousness. May the <HI>Lord's Day</HI> be duly sanctified, and all Prophanations of it by worldly Business and Recreations be removed far away! May the holy Sacraments, <HI>Baptism and tbe Lord's Supper,</HI> be administred without idolatrous Mixtures, or sacrilegious Robbery. And in order to these Things, may our glorious Lord have a faith∣ful People to serve him on <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> Churches be gather'd there according to Scripture Pattern, and true Ministers of Christ be set over them in the Lord. And let us be warned to fly from those Sins which have provoked an holy God to cast out our Ene∣mies.

to trouble the Camp or Fleet. And may our Ene∣mies, convinc'd of the Vanity of <HI>graven Images,</HI> cast them away with Indignation, and worship God in Christ according to his Word. Lord! this is the Victory which we further ask over our Ene∣mies, that they may be sudued to Christ, and the Obedience of Faith, and with us partake in all the Blessings of the Gospel. May our Conversation therefore be such toward them, as shall adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour, and by the Blessing of God win them over to the Love and Practice of the true Protectant Religion!</P>
<P>In a Word, and to Conclude, May this glorious Victory be an Earnest of our Lord's taking to him∣self the entire Possession of this <HI>new World.</HI> May the Kings of the Earth that have given their Power to the Beast, have their Eyes open'd, that they may <HI>hate the Whore, and burn her with Fire!</HI> May that strong Voice be heard thro' the whole Earth, <HI>Ba∣bylon the Great is fallen, is fallen.</HI> May Antichrist be utterly destroyed by the Brightness of our Lord's Coming; the <HI>seventh Angel</HI> sound, and the King∣doms of this World become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ: He which testisieth these Things, faith, Surely I come quickly, <HI>Amen.
