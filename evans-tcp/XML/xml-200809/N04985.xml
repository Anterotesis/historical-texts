<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Honoured</HI> Gentlemen, <HI>and dear</HI> Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BEG Leave to offer the following <HI>Reply</HI> to you in par∣ticular, and humbly ask your kind <HI>Acceptanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of it: I may truly say, that the being engag'd in a <HI>Controversy</HI> of this Kind, is one of the most unexpected <HI>Events</HI> to me that ever I met with: 'Tis not long since that I had almost come to a full <HI>Resolution,</HI> never more to offer any <HI>Production</HI> of mine to <HI>publick View;</HI> being somewhat sensible of my <HI>Unfitness</HI> for Things of that <HI>Nature,</HI> and likewise desirous of <HI>Peace!</HI></P>
<P>But the All-governing <HI>Providence</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> sometimes brings about Things in a Way we know not, by a surprizing <HI>Train</HI> of <HI>Incidents!</HI></P>
<P>My appearing in Publick, by the first <HI>Discourse</HI> upon <HI>Defen∣sive War,</HI> which some of you were pleased to <HI>honour</HI> by your <HI>Presence,</HI> was not of my own <HI>Motion</HI> or Seeking, but what a little before I had almost determined against; having an Aver∣sion to <HI>Controversy,</HI> which I knew not but it might occasion: In the mean Time, you are sensible <HI>Sirs,</HI> that in the aforesaid <HI>Discourse,</HI> I endeavour'd carefully to <HI>guard</HI> against giving <HI>Cause</HI> of <HI>Offence</HI> to particular <HI>Persons</HI> or <HI>Societies,</HI> that were of dif∣ferent <HI>Sentiments;</HI> and only offered some of the <HI>Reasons</HI> of my <HI>Opinion,</HI> together with an <HI>Answer</HI> to some Objections.</P>
<P>That <HI>Discourse, Gentlemen,</HI> you were pleas'd (some of you) to encourage the <HI>Publication</HI> of; which, as it was an <HI>Evidence</HI> of your <HI>Regard</HI> to the <HI>Design</HI> of the <HI>Performance</HI> in general, so of your <HI>Kindness</HI> and <HI>Indulgence</HI> to <HI>me</HI> in Particular; for which I acknowledge my <HI>Obligation!</HI></P>
<P>The aforesaid <HI>Sermon,</HI> as you all know, has been since <HI>oppo∣sed</HI> from the <HI>Press,</HI> and that under the <HI>Umbrage</HI> of vindicating the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of a particular <HI>Society,</HI> which I had not attacked; this <HI>Composure</HI> I have carefully examined, and deliberately con∣sidered, and not being thereby convinced of any <HI>Mistake</HI> in my <HI>Sermon;</HI> I think it my Duty (tho' I am not comperatively <HI>par negotio</HI> equal to the Province) to defend it; and the rather at this Time, because I do not only look upon <HI>Defensive War</HI> to be an important Truth, as it respects <HI>Society</HI> in general, but a very seasonable <HI>Truth,</HI> considering our <HI>perilous Circumstances</HI> in Particular; and because in this <HI>Debate,</HI> I am upon the <HI>Defensive,</HI> and therefore do but act agreeable to the <HI>Position</HI> advanced in the <HI>Sermon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="006247_0004_10281FE6AECBF718"/>I cannot say that I have manag'd it as the <HI>Moment</HI> of the <HI>Subject</HI> deserves, and its <HI>Necessity</HI> requires; but I can s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, that I have attempted it, and this is my <HI>Comfort,</HI> that <HI>(In magnis voluisse sat est)</HI> in great and arduous <HI>Matters,</HI> an honest <HI>Essay</HI> is acceptable to a gracious <HI>God,</HI> thro' <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and will not be disagreeable to ingenuous and unbyassed <HI>Minds.</HI></P>
<P>And perhaps this humble <HI>Essay,</HI> this small <HI>Specimen</HI> of my good <HI>Wishes</HI> for the <HI>Defence</HI> of labouring <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruth,</HI> and an endan∣ger'd <HI>City</HI> and <HI>Colony,</HI> may incite some <HI>abler Pen</HI> to pour more <HI>Light</HI> upon the Point in <HI>Controversy,</HI> which would doubtle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s be of singular <HI>Service.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' I may safely say that my Heart is engaged in the <HI>Subject</HI> of the following <HI>Pages,</HI> with Design to promote the <HI>Safety</HI> of this (but lately) defenceless <HI>Province,</HI> yet I bless <HI>God</HI> I bear a friendly <HI>Disposition</HI> towards those who have a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fferent <HI>View</HI> of the <HI>Point</HI> in <HI>Debate;</HI> and have a <HI>cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itable Opinion</HI> of the good Intention, at least of divers of them, notwithstand∣ing.</P>
<P>And this, my dear <HI>Brethren!</HI> I would humbly advise you all to exercise; <HI>Charity thinks no Evil, but hopeth all Things</HI> — Altho' the <HI>Point</HI> appears clear to us, yet considering the great and secret <HI>Influence</HI> of <HI>Education,</HI> upon the most of Mankind, and the Number of <HI>Scripture Passages,</HI> which seem to have a <HI>Sound</HI> contrary to <HI>War,</HI> in <HI>Gospel Times;</HI> it is not to be won∣dered at, that some serious and well-dispos'd <HI>Minds,</HI> are <HI>scru∣pulous</HI> of it, or <HI>averse</HI> to it; and surely it is cruel to <HI>persecute</HI> them, for what they cannot help, yea, for that which doubt∣less they have a good <HI>Design</HI> in!</P>
<P>But if there be any, who are in their <HI>Consciences</HI> convinced of the <HI>Lawfulness</HI> of <HI>Defensive War,</HI> yet dare not appear for it, for <HI>Fear</HI> of the <HI>Displeasure</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> certainly it is no <HI>good Sign</HI> ei∣ther of their <HI>Piety</HI> or <HI>Courage.</HI></P>
<P>I would humbly ask of <HI>Readers</HI> in general, of every <HI>Deno∣mination,</HI> who shall be pleased to look into the following Per∣formance, this Act of <HI>Justice</HI> to me, and <HI>Favour</HI> to themselves, namely, That they would <HI>examine</HI> impartially, and <HI>weigh,</HI> without the <HI>Byas</HI> of <HI>Prepossession</HI> and <HI>Prejudice,</HI> what I have <HI>of∣fered</HI> in the <HI>Scales</HI> of <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Reason;</HI> for seeing <HI>Truth</HI> will not bend to our irregular <HI>Passions,</HI> it is best by calm and candid <HI>Enquiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> to labour to find it out amidst the <HI>Mazes</HI> and <HI>Colourings</HI> of <HI>Error</HI> and <HI>Mistake;</HI> and having found it, would we act up to the <HI>Character</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Christians,</HI> we should profess it boldly, and conform to it inviolably in our Conduct at all Adventures!

<HEAD>Defensive War Defended, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The INTRODUCTION.</P>
<P>PREVIOUS to my Entrance upon the <HI>Vindication</HI> itself, I would observe, that I have credible Information, that that <HI>Perfor∣mance</HI> is highly recommended by many; and has had, a few Days after the first, a second <HI>Edition.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Gentleman</HI> who is the <HI>Author</HI> thereof, is wel∣come to examine my Sermon with the severest <HI>Scrutiny.</HI></P>
<P>If I am mistaken in any Particular in it, I am willing to receive better <HI>Light</HI> and Information from any <HI>Quarter,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fas est, et ab hoste deceri.</NOTE> and to alter my <HI>Opinion</HI> upon Con∣viction by <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Reason;</HI> for it is TRUTH and the PUBLICK SAFETY, and not <HI>Victory,</HI> I seek.</P>
<P>And doubtless, the aforesaid <HI>Gentleman</HI> has a Right to express his Sentiments as well as any others: Nor can I think that <HI>Truth</HI> will lose Ground by proper <HI>Enquiries;</HI> we are all <HI>Men,</HI> and therefore <HI>fallible Creatures,</HI> liable to manifold Mistakes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Homo sum, et humanum nil a me alienum puto.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the mean Time I can't but admire at the Title of his <HI>Performance!</HI> He is pleas'd to call it, <HI>A Vin∣dication of the Doctrine of Christianity; as held by the People called</HI> QUAKERS; which seems to insinu∣ate, that I had attack'd that <HI>Society</HI> in particular in my Sermon, which I have not done, nor any other.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="006247_0006_10281FE9B5B40FE8"/>I had no <HI>Party-View</HI> in that <HI>Discourse:</HI> No! my <HI>Design</HI> was, and still is <HI>Catholick;</HI> namely, to pro∣mote, according to my Capacity, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pro viribus.</NOTE> the common <HI>Safety</HI> of all the <HI>Societies</HI> in the <HI>Colony;</HI> and there∣fore I will not intermeddle with <HI>Party-Disputes</HI> in the Course of this Debate, any farther than I judge necessary to open the <HI>Cause</HI> in <HI>Controversy,</HI> whatever Provocation has been given thereto notwithstand∣ing: No! I resolve to keep to the generous <HI>Plan</HI> upon which I have embark'd, and to contend by <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Argument,</HI> for the <HI>Protection</HI> of our <HI>Author,</HI> and the <HI>Society</HI> to which he belongs, as well as others, how displeas'd soever perhaps he is, or may be, with my <HI>Concern</HI> and <HI>Endeavours</HI> that Way!</P>
<P>Surely this <HI>Gentleman</HI> must needs know, that there are divers Persons in this <HI>Colony,</HI> and that of vari∣ous <HI>Denominations,</HI> besides the <HI>Quakers,</HI> who are a∣gainst <HI>Defensive War,</HI> as well as many of them? Why therefore should he apply the Sermon to them parti∣cularly, more than to others of the same Way of thinking in that Point?</P>
<P>When I think it my <HI>Duty</HI> to attack any <HI>Society</HI> in particular about their <HI>Principles,</HI> I will endeavour to defend my <HI>Charge</HI> as well as I can; but till then, I desire to be excus'd.</P>
<P>As to this <HI>Gentleman</HI>'s Intention in the Perfor∣mance aforesaid, I charitably hope it is as he expres∣ses it in his Preface. God forbid that I should con∣demn the <HI>States</HI> and <HI>Designs</HI> of thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that differ from me in the <HI>Point</HI> under <HI>Debate;</HI> such as are <HI>truly Re∣ligious,</HI> may, I believe, differ in <HI>Principles</HI> that more deeply affect the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Christianity,</HI> and yet be sincere!</P>
<P>However, I confess, that the <HI>Time</HI> he chuses for his publick <HI>Animad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersions</HI> upon a Catholick <HI>Sermon,</HI> calculated to promote the publick <HI>Safety,</HI> is so peril∣ous,
<PB N="3" REF="006247_0007_10281FEBD75870C0"/>
and the <HI>Manner</HI> of his <HI>Management,</HI> in some Instances, so extraordinary (as I shall afterwards en∣deavour to evince) that it is somewhat difficult to reconcile these Things to his good <HI>Intentions!</HI></P>
<P>One wou'd think that if he didn't believe it to be his Duty to do any Thing of an encouraging Ten∣dency towards the noble <HI>Design</HI> of the ASSOCI∣ATION himself, he might at least suffer others unoppos'd, to use Means for the <HI>Protection</HI> of <HI>him</HI> and the <HI>Society</HI> to which he belongs, among others; and for a longer Time at least, agreeable to the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Proverb <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Festina leute;</HI> hasten slowly▪</NOTE> have suspended his entering into an <HI>offensive War</HI>—Yet still I hope the best of him, and ascribe his odd Management rather to the <HI>Difficulty</HI> of supporting his <HI>Cause,</HI> and the Warmth of his <HI>Zeal</HI> for it, than to any bad <HI>Design!</HI></P>
<P>My Purpose at present is to enquire into the Me∣rits of the Cause in Controversy, and to reflect no more upon our <HI>Author</HI>'s Management of it (and that with <HI>Reluctance</HI> and Regret) than <HI>Justice</HI> to the aforesaid important <HI>Cause</HI> necessarily requires.</P>
<P>Personal Reflections are certainly of little Mo∣ment in Controversy: <HI>Truth</HI> should be received for its own sake, with <HI>Candour</HI> and Readiness, by whomsoever it is proposed, let their <HI>Denomination</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> be what it will, seeing the Qualities of the Person speaking or writing, cannot enter in∣to the Nature of the <HI>Truths</HI> they communicate, or in the least alter them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Method</HI> I propose for my <HI>Reply,</HI> is just to examine the <HI>Force</HI> of the <HI>Objections</HI> offered against the <HI>Arguments</HI> of my Sermon.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> begins his <HI>Animadversions,</HI> by obser∣ving that the Deliverance to which my <HI>Text</HI> refers, was <HI>miraculous</HI>—wrought without any human Con∣trivance or Force.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="006247_0008_10281FF0C2B95788"/><HI>Ans.</HI> Who has said any Thing to the Contrary? It was not from any Supposition of <HI>Israel</HI>'s fighting, at that Time (tho' they were prepared for it, and under Arms) that I drew any Inference in Favour of my Sentiment; but from the FIGHTING of <HI>Israel</HI>'s GOD, and the just TITLE ascrib'd to him on that Occasion, <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>is a</HI> MAN <HI>of</HI> WAR.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> again observes very justly, that the Command to <HI>Israel,</HI> when closely pursued by their Enemies, was, <HI>Fear ye not, stand still, and see the Salvation of God, the Lord shall fight for you:</HI> But wasn't there good Reason for their Standing still, when God promised to fight for them in a miracu∣lous Manner? Mr. <HI>Poole</HI> observes, that the Com∣mand of standing still, denotes the calm Posture of their <HI>Minds,</HI> and not of their Bodies <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Poole</HI>'s Annotat. in Loc.</NOTE>: But if any incline to extend the Sense further, even to the Bo∣dy, I shall not contend; no, tho' they themselves should conform thereto in their own Practice, pro∣vided they can get a Promise from God, that he will fight miraculously for them.</P>
<P>But by the by, I confess I am surpriz'd! that a∣ny of the Children of Men, should be so bold, as to represent that to be <HI>Evil</HI> in itself, and absolutely for∣bid by the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> which they may easi∣ly perceive God himself has done, <HI>The Lord shall fight for you, Exod.</HI> xiv. 13. as if it was wicked and contrary to the <HI>Gospel</HI> to be like <HI>God;</HI> O strange unaccountable Notion! I forbear to give it the Name, which, in my Opinion, it really deserves!</P>
<P>But our <HI>Author</HI> proceeds to say, <Q>Tho' some Wars were commanded of God, under that Dis∣pensation, and therefore these Appellations, <HI>A Man of War, the Lord of Hosts,</HI> &amp;c. were then suit∣able and proper, yet I cannot, saith he, perceive that they discover any Approbation <HI>of War, be∣gun
<PB N="5" REF="006247_0009_10281FF5D290D2A8"/>
and carried on at the mere Will and Pleasure of Men,</HI> I rather take them to denote the <HI>Great∣ness of his Power and Superiority,</HI> and therefore the <HI>Justness</HI> and Propriety of an <HI>entire Dependance upon God.</HI></Q> And then the Case of <HI>Gideon</HI> is intro∣duced, who at the Command of God, reduced his Army from 32,000 to 300, and put the mighty <HI>Host</HI> of the <HI>Midianites</HI> to Flight; <Q>Here (says our Author) tho' the Use of outward Means was per∣mitted, a strong and entire Dependance upon God was required, even in that Day: Can such a Dependance be less necessary in a Day of Gospel Light?</Q></P>
<P>Here observe, that our Author acknowledges ex∣presly, in the above Paragraph, these three Things, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That some Wars were commanded by God, under the <HI>Jewish</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ispensation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the aforesaid Appellations of <HI>Man of War, &amp;c.</HI> were suitable and proper then.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That tho' the Use of outward Means was per∣mitted, a strong and entire Dependance upon God was required even in that Day.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Upon the aforesaid Concessions, I would propose the following Queries, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 1, Can it be reasonably supposed that the Almighty can command at any Time what is contra∣ry to his Nature or Approbation?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 2. Is the Almighty God changed now in his <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Properties,</HI> from what he was under the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation? Doesn't the Scripture de∣clare, That <HI>He is far from the Shadow of Change?</HI> Now if the Almighty does not, cannot change, in the aforesaid Respects, then I query,</P>
<P N="3">3. How comes our Author, Page 3, 4. after he had mentioned my Endeavour to prove from my Text, and some other Appellations given to the Al∣mighty
<PB N="6" REF="006247_0010_10281FF967AB9808"/>
in the Old Testament, <HI>viz, The Lord of Hosts, The God of the Armies of Israel, &amp;c.</HI> to prove from thence that War was agreeable to him, to insert under the Margin this Text, <HI>Lam.</HI> iii. 33. <HI>The Lord doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men;</HI> if it be not to prove a Change in God's Nature, is it not impertinent to the Point un∣der Debate? And if it be, how shocking is the Doc∣trine our Author advances? For if <HI>God</HI> changes in his <HI>Nature,</HI> he must grow better or worse; if better, he was imperfect before the Change; if worse, he is imperfect after it; and consequently either Way he cannot be God!.</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 4. How comes our Author to pass by in entire Silence the Argument I advanced in the Ser∣mon he opposes, to prove that <HI>War</HI> is approved of by the Almighty, which is this (Page 6) <Q>And can we think Sirs, that the Almighty would ac∣cept of a Name contrary to his Nature, or suffer himself to be called by any Thing he dislikes or detests?</Q> If our Author thinks that <HI>Defensive War</HI> is contrary to the Divine Nature, why didn't he answer that Question in the Negative, and speak out fairly?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 5. Why does our <HI>Author</HI> in the aforesaid Paragraph change the State of the Question, and speak of a War <HI>begun and pursued at the meer Plea∣sure and Will of Men?</HI> Have I not in stating the Question under Debate, expresly opposed such a wicked <HI>offensive War,</HI> in these Words; (Page 6, 7) <Q>That Kind of War is not approved of by God, which is commenced merely to gratify the <HI>Ambi∣tion</HI> and <HI>Avarice</HI> of <HI>Princes</HI>—Such <HI>Wars</HI> are un∣doubtedly unlawful; and likewise all such as are begun without a View to <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Peace,</HI> and carried on without <HI>Compassion</HI> and <HI>Humanity.</HI></Q> Is this candid Management? But I proceed:</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="006247_0011_10281FFAF7E96A60"/><HI>Query</HI> 6. Why does our <HI>Author,</HI> in the aforesaid Paragraph, in order to remove the Force of my Argument from the aforesaid Appellation (mention'd to prove God's Approbation of War) insinuate some <HI>Contrariety</HI> between God's <HI>Approbation</HI> of <HI>War,</HI> and his <HI>Greatness, Power, Superiority, Sufficiency,</HI> and our <HI>Dependance</HI> on him: If such a Contrariety be not in∣sinuated, how is his Gloss supported? And if it be, how can it be prov'd contrary to the express <HI>Com∣mand</HI> of the Almighty for <HI>War</HI> at that Time? Isn't it easy to conceive a sweet <HI>Harmony</HI> in these Things? namely, God's being entitled a <HI>Man of War;</HI> his commanding <HI>Defensive War;</HI> his approving what he commands; his presiding over all <HI>Wars,</HI> by his <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Providence,</HI> and therefore a Necessity of our entire and continual <HI>Dependance</HI> upon him, in the Use of <HI>Means</HI> for <HI>Success.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 7. What does our <HI>Author</HI> bring the In∣stance of <HI>Gideon</HI> for? Is it to prove what no Body denies, namely, the Almighty <HI>Power</HI> of God; the Necessity of entire <HI>Dependance</HI> on God, in the Use of <HI>Means;</HI> if so, it is impertinent to the Point in Debate, and unkind Dealing; for it insinuates, that such as are now for <HI>Defensive War,</HI> question the <HI>Pow∣er</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and oppose an entire <HI>Dependance</HI> upon his <HI>Providence.</HI> This Insinuation he farther manifests in the Close of the aforesaid Paragraph, in these Words, <Q>Can such a Dependance be less necessary in a Day of Gospel-Light?</Q></P>
<P>Now that such an Insinuation is unreasonable, ap∣pears from his own Concession beforementioned, whereby he acknowledges a <HI>Permission</HI> of the out∣ward Means (<HI>viz.</HI> of War) and yet that a strong and entire Dependance upon God was at the same Time requir'd. Well, if both these Things were requir'd and consistent then, why not now?</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="006247_0012_10281FFC853D6E40"/>Farther: That the aforesaid Insinuation is unjust, appears from the following Paragraph of the Sermon which he opposes, <HI>Page</HI> 39; <Q>But, <HI>Sirs,</HI> allow me to observe, that tho' outward <HI>Means</HI> are necessary and excellent in their Place, yet they are not like to be crown'd with <HI>Success,</HI> except we look above them to <HI>God</HI> for <HI>Direction</HI> and <HI>Assistance;</HI> except we <HI>repent</HI> of our <HI>Sins,</HI> and <HI>reform</HI> our <HI>Lives!</HI></Q></P>
<P>But if our Author brings the Instance of <HI>Gideon</HI> to prove that the <HI>Mean</HI> of <HI>War</HI> is not at Times ne∣cessary or requir'd by the <HI>Almighty,</HI> he contradicts what he acknowledges, and opposes the Instance he produces: For tho' <HI>Gideon,</HI> by God's Command, reduc'd his <HI>Army</HI> to a small Number, yet i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> didn't reduce the Number to nothing; and with that small Number that remain'd, he us'd diverse <HI>Stratagems</HI> to obtain <HI>Victory;</HI> he divided it into three <HI>Battalions</HI> to make the greater Appearance; made his Descent in the <HI>Night,</HI> when he was least expected, in order to put the Enemy into Consternation! And likewise he labour'd to alarm their <HI>Fear,</HI> by the sounding of <HI>Trumpets,</HI> the Clashing of <HI>Pitchers,</HI> the <HI>Blazing</HI> of <HI>Torches,</HI> and by the <HI>Shouts</HI> of his <HI>Soldiers, every one crying aloud, The Sword of the Lord, and of Gideon</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Judg.</HI> 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 8. Why does our Author, in the Instance of <HI>Gideon,</HI> at first speak of God's commanding and directing him, and his obeying; and yet a Line or two afterwards, when he comes to make mention of the Use of outward Means, Why does he change the Form of Expression into the soft Word <HI>permit∣ted?</HI> 'Tho' the Use of outward Means was <HI>permit∣ted.</HI>' Had he no Design in this?</P>
<P>But I must hasten to the next Paragraph, which speaks of God's prohibiting <HI>David</HI>'s building the <HI>Temple.</HI> For Answer to this Objection I refer the
<PB N="9" REF="006247_0013_102820072BF4AF80"/>
Reader to two Sermons upon <HI>Exodus</HI> xv. 3. now in Mr. <HI>Bradford</HI>'s Press, and shall only add a little by Way of <HI>Reply,</HI> to two Particulars in the latter Part of the aforesaid Paragraph, (V. P. 5,) where our Author,</P>
<P N="1">1st Enquires, in the following Words; <Q>If a Cessation from War was necessary for the building that outward Temple, How much more so is it, for the Gathering of all Nations to be Members of the Church of Christ?</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> A Freedom from the Disturbances and Injuries consequent upon <HI>offensive War,</HI> is, no doubt, a valuable Priviledge in many Respects; and what therefore we should not only desire after, but labour for, by opposing with all our Might, under <HI>God,</HI> the cruel <HI>Cause</HI> of those <HI>Miseries (viz. offensive War.)</HI> I therefore commend our Author's <HI>Zeal,</HI> in taking Pains to write against that <HI>great Iniquity</HI> (tho' I cou'd wish he had done it with more Distinctness, and then the Trouble of a <HI>Reply</HI> wou'd have been prevented.) I should be glad to hear of the Increase of his <HI>Zeal</HI> aforesaid, that so, if Necessity requir'd, he might with as great Readiness and Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or use his <HI>Sword,</HI> as he has his Quill against it, in order to its utter Ex∣tirpation, and the procuring of that glorious and de∣lightful Blessing of <HI>Peace!</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Our <HI>Author</HI> towards the close of the aforesaid Paragraph speaks thus: <Q>Tho' the Almighty is sti∣led by <HI>Moses, A Man of War,</HI> he is called by the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii. 11. <HI>The God of Love and Peace.</HI> And the Apostle <HI>John</HI> saith, <HI>God is Love, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 16.</Q> Here I would beg leave to propose a few Queries, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 1. Was not God represented as full of Mercy under the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation? See <HI>Exod.</HI> xxxiv. 6, 7. <HI>And the Lord passed by before him, and
<PB N="10" REF="006247_0014_10282008ADE47578"/>
proclaim'd, The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and grac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous, long-suffering, and abundant in Goodness and Truth, keeping Mercy for Thousands, forgiving Ini∣quity, and Transgression, and Sin.</HI> Jer. xxxi. 20. <HI>Is Ephraim my dear Son? Is he a pleasant Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld? For since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still; therefore my Bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have Mercy upon him, saith the Lord.</HI> Hos. xi 8. <HI>How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? Mine Heart is turned within me; my Repentings are kind∣led together.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 2. Is not JUSTICE the Foundation of DE∣FENSIVE WAR? And isn't God invariably just, as well as merciful, in his <HI>Nature?</HI> Is not <HI>Justice</HI> one of his essential <HI>Attributes?</HI> And if so, will it not follow, that he is, and always will be inclined to ap∣prove of <HI>Defensive War,</HI> when there is a Necessity of it, so long as he retains the same <HI>Nature?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 3. Is there not a perfect and perpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ual <HI>Har∣mony</HI> between the <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> of <HI>God?</HI> What is his <HI>Mercy</HI> or <HI>Love,</HI> but a <HI>Property</HI> of his <HI>Nature,</HI> inclining him to vouchsafe Kindnesses upon his peni∣tent and believing Creatures? And what is his <HI>Ju∣stice,</HI> but a <HI>Property</HI> of his <HI>Nature,</HI> disposing him to render to impenitent and unbelieving Transgres∣sors, the Punishment due for their Offences <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The general Idea of Justice, <HI>Est suum cuique tribuere,</HI> To give every one his Due.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>Now, tho' there be a Difference in the <HI>Objects</HI> up∣on which those divine <HI>Perfections</HI> terminate in their outward Acts; yet there is none in the <HI>Principle</HI> of them; no! it is the same divine <HI>Nature,</HI> producing wisely and voluntarily various <HI>Effects</HI> upon different <HI>Objects,</HI> suitable to the different <HI>Occasions</HI> that pre∣sent themselves, and in such a <HI>Way</HI> as serves to an∣swer
<PB N="11" REF="006247_0015_1028200A70DDE728"/>
the <HI>End</HI> of God's <HI>Government</HI> over the intelli∣gent Beings. Or,</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 4. Has the great <HI>God,</HI> I would speak it with awful Reverence, lost one of his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttributes,</HI> viz. his <HI>Justice,</HI> since the <HI>Gospel</HI> Dispensation (strict∣ly so called) commenced? Or have we a GOD diffe∣rent in <HI>Nature</HI> from the <HI>God</HI> of the <HI>Jewish Church?</HI> If not, then one of two Things in my Apprehension will necessarily follow, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That what was <HI>moral,</HI> or, in other Words, a∣greeable in itself to the divine <HI>Nature</HI> then, is so now; and consequently <HI>Defensive War</HI> is lawful. Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. That we have no <HI>God</HI> at all, seeing he has lost one of his <HI>Attributes,</HI> he is imperfect, and of Con∣sequence no <HI>God;</HI> for the Idea of a GOD necessarily includes absolute Perfection; and therefore upon this <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> there is now no <HI>Religion</HI> at all, no fu∣ture State of Rewards and Punishments, they are all but a mere <HI>Chimera,</HI> a vain <HI>Phantom;</HI> the former has no <HI>Object,</HI> and the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter no <HI>Foundation</HI> of Cer∣tainty; It is, I confess, a shocking, but, in my O∣pinion, a just and unavoidable Consequence!</P>
<P>Now, seeing that from <HI>Truth</HI> nothing but <HI>Truth</HI> will flow<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is a Maxim in Philosophy, <HI>Quod ex veris nil nisi verum.</HI></NOTE>, it is therefore evident, that the <HI>Princi∣ple</HI> from which those <HI>Absurdities</HI> do naturally and freely proceed, must needs be false, <HI>viz.</HI> The De∣nial of the Lawfulness of <HI>Defensive War.</HI></P>
<P>The next Particular that our Author animadverts upon, is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llowing Passage of my <HI>Sermon,</HI> Page 8. <Q>Surely a <HI>Protection</HI> from Iniuries, <HI>Peace</HI> among Neighbours, and the Administration of <HI>Justice,</HI> be desirable and valuable Benefits, which all Man∣kind must with one Voice acknowledge; then of Consequence that which at Times is the only <HI>Mean</HI> left to procure them, must be lawful, necessary and valuable also.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006247_0016_1028200C440CF4F0"/>Our Author observes upon the aforesaid Words as follows, in his V. Page 6. <Q>The only <HI>Mean</HI> here is <HI>War,</HI> and whether the Expression suits with the Belief of an over-ruling, omnipresent <HI>Providence,</HI> without whose Permission no Evil can happen, and who alone hath the Controul of every Thing, I would have a little to be thought upon.</Q>—</P>
<P>To which I answer, that the Sense our Author puts upon my Words (The only Mean) is forced, as may appear from the very Paragraph of the Ser∣mon that immediately precedes what he has cited, (except one) in which I speak thus: <Q><HI>War</HI> is no doubt lawful, and consequently approved by God, when undertaken by the <HI>Magistrate</HI> for the Pu∣nishment of some great <HI>Injury</HI> or Wrong, which much affects the <HI>Credit</HI> and <HI>Interest</HI> of a Nation or People, after all softer Means fail of Success;</Q>
<HI>i. e.</HI> All human <HI>outward Means;</HI> this Sense the Se∣ries of the Sermon naturally leads to. Now, there being a Connection between this and the other Para∣graph, the Sense of the Words (Only Mean) must be the same, <HI>viz.</HI> The only <HI>human</HI> or outward <HI>Mean;</HI> it was about such, and such only, that I was reasoning, and therefore it was a Force upon the Words to put that Sense upon them, which our Au∣thor has done. This will appear more plainly from what I have said in the Improvement of the Sub∣ject (S. p. 39) where it was proper that I should speak of <HI>spiritual Means;</HI> the Words are these;</P>
<P><Q>But Sirs allow me to observe, that tho' <HI>out∣ward Means</HI> are necessary and excellent in their Place, yet they are not like to be crowned with <HI>Success,</HI> except we look above them to God for Direction and Assistance; except we repent of our Sins, and reform our Lives.</Q> Here I plainly di∣stinguish between outward and spiritual Means, as∣sert a Necessity of, and yet an Insufficiency in both,
<PB N="13" REF="006247_0017_1028200DF2DDD9C0"/>
without the Concurrence of Providence, to answer the End design'd.</P>
<P>Yet our Author is pleased to put a hard Sense upon the Words aforesaid, and thence takes Occa∣sion to question my Belief of an overruling, omni∣present Providence, and so gravely sets about the Proof of it for my Conviction <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Calumniare fortiter, &amp; aliquid adherebit.</NOTE>. O unaccounta∣ble! This is the first time in my <HI>Life</HI> that I have been charged with <HI>Atheism;</HI> for he that denies a Providence, of Consequence denies a <HI>God!</HI> He leaves out one Half of the Paragraph, and casts Dust upon me, in the Room of an Answer to the other. Now, whether such a Method of managing Controversy be a Sign of a good <HI>Cause,</HI> or of can∣did <HI>Conduct,</HI> I leave to the <HI>Reader</HI> to determine, and proceed to consider,</P>
<P>The next Objection, which is <HI>Vind. p.</HI> 8. Here our Author cites Mr. <HI>Poole</HI>'s Annotations on <HI>Sam.</HI> xxx. 7. and labours to make that learned and consi∣stent Man's Writings serve a Purpose contrary to his professed Sentiments, but in vain: All that can be reasonably inferred from Mr. <HI>Poole</HI>'s Gloss is this. That it was their Duty under that Dispensation to consult the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> upon the High-priest's <HI>Breastplate,</HI> for immediate Information and Direction in some difficult Cases.</P>
<P>Upon the aforesaid Instance our Author speaks thus, <HI>p.</HI> 8. <Q>If then it had been an Error, not to have enquired of God, in so pinching a Case as this, the Consequence fairly deducible is, That should we be in the like Circumstances, we must make the like Enquiry, and receive the divine Per∣mission and Command, otherwise <HI>David</HI>'s Exam∣ple will not be wholly followed.</Q></P>
<P>I answer, That if we were under the same <HI>Dis∣pensation</HI> with <HI>David,</HI> the Consequence would be
<PB N="14" REF="006247_0018_10282012593C9240"/>
just and fair, that in the same Circumstances we should make the like Enquiry; but otherwise the Consequence is not fair; from different Premises the same Conclusion cannot flow, and so the Case is here.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Dispensation</HI> we have no temporal <HI>High-priest,</HI> with the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim</HI> upon his <HI>Breast∣plate,</HI> from whom we may expect immediate and o∣racular Answers about Things to come; and there∣fore it is not possible for us, in this State of Things, <HI>wholly to follow</HI> David's <HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>Nor have we any Necessity for, or Promise of immediate objective <HI>Revelation,</HI> in place of the <HI>Jewish Urim,</HI> in the ordinary Times of the Gospel, from Christ our <HI>High-priest,</HI> in any Matters what∣soever, whether temporal or spiritual, by <HI>Visions, Voices,</HI> &amp;c. seeing <HI>the Prophecy is sealed,</HI> the <HI>Ca∣non</HI> of <HI>Scriptures</HI> is compleated, and <HI>able to make the Man of God perfect, and thoroughly furnished to eve∣ry good Work.</HI></P>
<P>It is enough, that we have in place of the <HI>Urim</HI> a greater Measure of the Influences of the holy Spirit than the pious <HI>Jews</HI> ordinarily enjoyed, enlightening our Minds in the Use of appointed Means, to the right understanding of the Meaning of the holy Scriptures, and enabling us to believe their divine Authority; and so impressing the Truths contained in them upon our <HI>Hearts,</HI> as to transform them in∣to the divine <HI>Image,</HI> and reform our Practice, a∣greeable to the divine <HI>Law:</HI> This I call <HI>subjective Revelation,</HI> which is necessary to Salvation.</P>
<P>It is true, the Apostles were immediately inspired, or had an <HI>objective,</HI> infallible <HI>Revelation</HI> of new <HI>Truths,</HI> in the same extraordinary Manner which the Prophets of old had; and it was necessary it should be so in the Beginning of the Christian <HI>Institution,</HI> seeing they were to commit to Writing a <HI>Rule</HI> to di∣rect
<PB N="15" REF="006247_0019_10282014111B0740"/>
the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> in all suc∣ceeding Ages, which they could not do infallibly without immediate <HI>Revelation;</HI> and of this extraor∣dinary <HI>Endowment</HI> they could give certain rational Evidences, by working real <HI>Miracles;</HI> without which, we have no Reason to believe the Claims of any thereto.</P>
<P>But in the ordinary Times of the Gospel, after the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of Religion were sufficiently confirm∣ed by miraculous Works, and the <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> fully committed to Writing, there is no Need of extraordinary <HI>Inspiration,</HI> or miraculous <HI>Works,</HI> the holy <HI>Scriptures,</HI> the sanctifying Influ∣ences of the blessed <HI>Spirit,</HI> the Dispensations of di∣vine <HI>Providence,</HI> together with the sober Use of our own <HI>Reason,</HI> are sufficient to direct us in every Du∣ty we owe to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover it may be observed, that <HI>David</HI> did not in the aforesaid Instance, consult the <HI>Ephod,</HI> whether it was lawful to go to War in general, but whether it was expedient for him to pursue the <HI>Amalekites</HI> at that Time in particular, and what would be the <HI>Issue</HI> of it, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxx. 8. And <HI>Da∣vid enquired at the Lord, Shall I pursue after this Troop, shall I overtake them? and be answered him, pursue, for thou shalt overtake them, and without fail recover all;</HI> agreeable hereto is the Instance of <HI>Keilab,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxiii. 9.—13. where <HI>David</HI> only consults the <HI>Ephod</HI> concerning <HI>Events,</HI> and receives Answers accordingly.</P>
<P>Now seeing the <HI>Government</HI> of our <HI>Nation</HI> is no <HI>Theocracy</HI> (nor the Government of any other) as the <HI>Jewish</HI> certainly was; if the Conductors of the <HI>State,</HI> must enter upon no Business of great <HI>Difficul∣ty</HI> and Moment, till they get an immediate Answer concerning the <HI>Event,</HI> as the <HI>Jews</HI> did from the <HI>Urim,</HI> our national Affairs wou'd soon be embarras∣sed
<PB N="16" REF="006247_0020_1028201BDC089708"/>
in a Maze of inextricable Difficulty, and brought to Desolation and <HI>Ruin!</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Supposition that some did by immedi∣ate <HI>Inspiration,</HI> really obtain a certain Knowledge of some future <HI>Events,</HI> and of the Expediency of Performing this or that <HI>Duty</HI> at such a Time; yet if they cou'dn't prove the Reality of it to others, by miraculous Works, their bare Declaration cou'd give no reasonable Satisfaction to others that wanted such a Revelation, and so must needs fail of answer∣ing the <HI>Necessities</HI> of the Publick.</P>
<P>Nor do we find that the <HI>Jews</HI> always consulted the <HI>Urim,</HI> respecting every of their Battles; and we know not that <HI>Abraham</HI> had any to consult a∣bout his famous Fight with <HI>Chederla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer</HI>—Yet he was at no Loss about his Duty, in that Affair, but directly obey'd the Call of Providence.</P>
<P>Our Author silently passes over what I have said in the 9 <HI>p.</HI> of the <HI>Ser.</HI> respecting the prudential Care that People take, in securing of their temporal Goods; and the Advice of King <HI>Asa</HI> to fortify their Cities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as well as the Inference drawn from it, of preserving our Lives, which are a more valu∣able Depositum (<HI>S. p.</HI> 10) and proceeds to confute my Argument from the <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> which he has tho't proper not to mention, and only finds Fault with my saying, that it was from God; and then labours to remove the Force of the Argument, by a Distinction.</P>
<P>Now in order to have a just View of this Matter, it will be necessary to cite my Argument and his An∣swer, and then propose a few Queries.</P>
<P>The Argument in the Sermnon, is as follows (<HI>p.</HI> 10) <Q>It is true, Man was originally created for the maintaining of Peace with his Fellows, and to this all the Laws of Nature, respecting others, have a primary Regard; yet when milder Measures can∣not
<PB N="17" REF="006247_0021_1028202101195F40"/>
screen us from intollerable Injuries, the <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> directs to fly to Force as the last Reme∣dy, the last Resource; for the <HI>Obligation</HI> to the Offices of <HI>Peace</HI> is mutual, and binds all alike. Nature hath given no Man a Priviledge of break∣ing her Laws at Pleasure towards others, and yet obliged them to maintain the <HI>Peace</HI> towards him: No; the Duty being mutual, should be mutual∣ly performed; and he that violates the Laws of Peace, and seeks another's Destruction, may im∣pute to his own Wickedness, all the Misery which another is necessitated in his own Defence, and in Pursuit of the Principle of it, to inflict upon him.</Q></P>
<P>Our Author's Answer is expressed thus, <Q>The first Proof proposed in the Sermon, that War in the foregoing Instances is lawful, is from the Light of Nature; and I should not have attack'd the Arguments drawn from thence, had not the Wri∣ter thereof asked, <HI>"Who is the Author thereof but God himself?"</HI> The following Distinction seems therefore necessary to be made: God crea∣ted Man good, upright and holy, and had he con∣tinued in this State, there never would have been <HI>any War, and consequently no Need of Self-de∣fence:</HI> But Man falling, thro' Disobedience, his Nature became corrupted, his Faculties depraved, and the whole intellectual System disordered; thus began shedding of Blood, and the Earth was early filled with Violence. This was the unhap∣py Consequence of Sin. I hope this Writer will not venture to say, that God was the Author of Nature thus corrupted; the Nature, and the Light of Nature, that he was Author of, was ho∣ly, <HI>innocent</HI> and <HI>perfect;</HI> but the Corruption in Nature, from whence proceeded Violence and Bloodshed, was occasioned by adhering to the Voice of <HI>Satan.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="006247_0022_102820229FC0BD08"/>To which I reply, as follows; Is it so, accord¦ing to our Author's Acknowledgment, that had Man continued in his primitive, good, upright and holy State, there never would have been any <HI>War,</HI> and consequently NO NEED OF SELF-DEFENCE; then it naturally follows, from his own Method of Reasoning, that there is now Need of SELF-DE∣FENCE: Seeing, as he justly observes, Man is fallen and corrupted. By War, our Author seems here plainly to mean <HI>Offensive War,</HI> and gives a brief, but substantial Hint of the Necessity of <HI>Self-defence</HI> (and consequently of <HI>Defensive War,</HI> which is the same) against it. This is wholsome Doctrine in∣deed, and the very Sum of all that I have been con∣tending for in the Sermon; the natural and easy Sense of the Words aforesaid, is this; If innocent Man had continued in his original Integrity, there would have been no Violence committed, and con∣sequently no Need of Defence against it; but now Man is fallen, degenerate and corrupted, inclin'd to commit Acts of Violence, and to shed Blood, and therefore there is a Necessity of <HI>Self-defence,</HI> to screen us from that Violence; and thus our Author indeed reasons well in that Particular, but in the mean time gives up his Cause.</P>
<P>But this Consequence he seems to oppose, by ob∣serving what confirms it, namely, That Violence proceeded from the Corruption of Nature, and was occasioned by adhering to the Voice of Satan; very true, all unjust Violence, or <HI>Offensive War</HI> (which is the same Thing in other Words) proceeds from those criminal Causes, and therefore there is a Ne∣cessity of <HI>Self-defence,</HI> or of <HI>Defensive War,</HI> to op∣pose and suppress that <HI>Violence,</HI> that Iniquity: Now inasmuch as <HI>Self-defence</HI> does oppose and tends to subdue it, it must needs proceed from a contrary, and therefore a good Cause; unless our Author sup∣poses
<PB N="19" REF="006247_0023_10282025C59B5D20"/>
that the same Cause will produce contrary Ef∣fects, which is absurd and impossible.</P>
<P>Our Author is pleased to express some Charity to∣wards me, in the aforesaid Paragraph, by saying that he hopes I will not venture to say, that God was the Author of Nature thus corrupted; after ac∣knowledging my Obligations to the Gentleman, for his charitable Sentime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts,</P>
<P>I Answer, That Nature, and the Corruption of Nature, are two distinct and different Things; GOD is the Author of the former, but by no Means of the latter: By <HI>Nature</HI> I understand our very BE∣INGS; and by the Corruption of Nature, any Dis∣conformity to the moral Law of <HI>God,</HI> that cleaves to them in Man's fallen <HI>State.</HI></P>
<P>There is likewise a great Difference between the Light of Nature, even in Man's fallen State, and the corrupt Inclinations of Nature; these often op∣pose each other in Things moral, and therefore can∣not be the same; this inward <HI>Conflict</HI> between <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Lust,</HI> divers <HI>Pagans</HI> perceived and lamented<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Video meliora proboque, deteriora Sequer. Nitimur in veti∣tum, semper cupimusque negatum.</NOTE>! Hence I may say justly, that our Author didn't do well in blending th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Things together, in the afore∣said Paragraph, by which his unwary Reader is apt to be imposed upon.</P>
<P>But to make this Matter still more plain, and easy to be understood, let it be observed, that I shewed in the Sermon what I meant by the Law of Nature (which this Gentleman has taken no Notice of) namely, something that was substantially the same with the Moral Law, <HI>p.</HI> 14.</P>

impair'd by Man's Apostacy, yet there are still such Remains of it in the human Mind, as shew (if suitably attended to and improved) the principal moral Duties required of us; this I conceive the A∣postle <HI>Paul</HI> confirms, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 14, 15. <HI>For when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by Nature the Things contained in the Law (i. e.</HI> the moral Law revealed in the Scriptures) <HI>were a Law unto themselves, which shew the Work of the Law writ∣ten in their Hearts,</HI> or some remaining Notices of it engraven upon their rational Nature; <HI>Their Consci∣ences bearing Witness, and their Thoughts the mean while accusing or excusing one another.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho' this Light of Nature be in a fallen corrupted Creature, yet it came originally from GOD, who is <HI>the Author of every good Gift;</HI> and hence <HI>Solomon</HI> calls the <HI>Spirit of Man the Candle of the Lord:</HI> It is true it is less in Degree and Influence than that which <HI>Adam</HI> enjoyed, yet it is and must be of the same Kind, inasmuch as it opposes the same moral Evils, and directs to the same moral Good, as far as it reaches.</P>
<P>It is called the Light and Law of Nature in a good Sense (which the Word Nature is capable of, as well as a bad) because the first Man received it together with his Nature or Being in Perfection, and we the <HI>Remains</HI> of it with ours. This Representa∣tion the Scripture before mentioned confirms; <HI>The Gentiles did by Nature (i. e.</HI> not by the Inclinations of Nature, which, at least, generally tend to Evil, but by the Light of Nature which directs to and ap∣proves of moral Good<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nil conscire s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bi nullave pallescere culpa, mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us abeneus esto.</HI> He that is conscious of no Crime, may be bold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd intrepid.</NOTE>.

that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> had no Notions of, and therefore it must be the Moral, which is for Substance the same with the Law of Nature<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Socrates</HI> expresses his Sentiments about the Law of Nature in the following Manner: <Q>There are (saith he) certain Laws which are not written; these are the Laws which are universally received throughout the World: But nevertheless Men did not make them; for all Men could not assemble themselves together in any one Place; neither could they all speak the same Lan∣guage. They were therefore made by the Gods. It is also commanded every where, and to every Man, to honour his Father a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Mother: And that Fathers and Mothers should not marry with their Children. No One ever violates with Impunity, any one Law established by the Gods. There are Punishments which inseparably adhere to the Crimes commit∣ted against those Laws, which Punishments it is impossible to escape; whereas a Man may easily ward against the Severity of human Laws, after he has transgressed them, either by concealing, or defending himself by open Force.—To do Good to them that do Good to us, is also a universal Law— When I consider that each Law carries with it the Punishment of him who transgresses it, I easily perceive it to be the Work of a <HI>Legislator</HI> more excellent than Man. The Gods never make any Laws that are unjust; on the contrary, other Le∣gislators, can scarce make any that are just.</Q>

<P>What tho' shedding of Blood and Violence in <HI>Defensive War,</HI> be the unhappy Consequence of Sin, <HI>i. e.</HI> There would have been no need thereof if Man had not sinned, yet it will not follow, as our Au∣thor imagines, that it is therefore sinful; then by the same Way of Reasoning, human Laws, and Physick, and shedding the Blood of Criminals by the Magistrate are <HI>sinful,</HI> and should be carefully avoid∣ed; which is false and absurd! Our Author's Ar∣gument concludes too much, and therefore nothing at all to his Purpose: All those Particulars but now mentioned, tho' they be the Consequences of the <HI>Sin</HI> of Man, <HI>i. e.</HI> they wou'dn't have been necessa∣ry, if Man had not <HI>sinned;</HI> yet they are not the

proper Effects of Sin; it is not <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Satan,</HI> but <HI>God</HI> and right <HI>Reason</HI> that direct to the regular Use of them; and therefore inasmuch as the Fall of Man renders them necessary, it is an Argument for, and not against them.</P>
<P>The Light of Nature directs to <HI>Health</HI> in the first Place, by the Use of all proper Means, and chuses it as the most agreeable State; but in Case of Sick∣ness, prescribes the Use of Physick, tho' disagreeable to our Inclinations, because medicinal and necessary for the Recovery of our <HI>Health.</HI></P>
<P>And thus, undoubtedly, the same Light and Law of Nature directs to pursue Peace with our <HI>Neighbours</HI> in the first Place, and chuses it as the most desirable Condition; but when this is lost, thro' the <HI>Injustice</HI> of others, in important <HI>Instances,</HI> and cannot be recovered by gentle <HI>Methods,</HI> the Light of Nature directs to the Use of Force to obtain it, ei∣ther by the Civil Law, or by <HI>Self-defence,</HI> and <HI>War</HI> as the last <HI>Remedy,</HI> which we are drove to with <HI>Reluctance,</HI> and by extream <HI>Necessity.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed, our <HI>Author</HI> observes in the afore∣said Paragraph, <Q>That the Light of Nature which God was the Author of, was <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>innocent:</HI></Q> Which implies, that the <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> in Man's fallen State, is sinful and guilty; and this he con∣firms in the following Words; <Q>For it is not from the <HI>degenerate fallen Light of Nature,</HI> that Argu∣ments are to be drawn, for the Formation of Christian Principles, neither are any from it of any Weight in Opposition thereto.</Q></P>
<P>Now considering that the <HI>Light</HI> or <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Na∣ture</HI> I reasoned from, is substantially the same with the <HI>Moral Law;</HI></P>
<P>'Was instituted for Man's Security, <HI>S. p.</HI> 12;</P>

<P N="1">1. Doesn't our <HI>Author</HI>'s charging the <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> in Man's fallen State, as being <HI>sinful,</HI> ne∣cessarily imply one of two Things, either an unfair speaking beside the Point, as I stated it, or some∣thing worse; namely a calling in Effect the <HI>Promo∣tion</HI> of <HI>Man</HI>'s <HI>Security,</HI> a <HI>primary Regard</HI> and <HI>Obligation</HI> to <HI>Peace,</HI> together with the whole <HI>moral Law</HI> of <HI>God, sinful.</HI> This is a <HI>Blow</HI> at the <HI>Root</HI> of all <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Religion;</HI> for if the <HI>moral Law</HI> be sinful, and it can't be otherwise, if the <HI>Light</HI> or <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> (which is the same in Sub∣stance with it) be so; then of Consequence it must be a <HI>Duty</HI> to break the <HI>Moral Law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 2. Can that be <HI>sinful</HI> which opposed Sin in the <HI>Pagans,</HI> and directed them to keep the <HI>moral Law?</HI> Then two Contraries are one and the same!</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 3. If the <HI>Light</HI> or <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> is not from <HI>God,</HI> then pray who is it from? Has <HI>Sin</HI> or <HI>Satan</HI> formed such a beautiful and consistent <HI>Scheme</HI> of <HI>Offices,</HI> that does so much <HI>Honour</HI> to human <HI>Nature,</HI> and so much promotes the Weal of <HI>Socie∣ty?</HI> Then certainly they have very much forgot their own <HI>Interest,</HI> and regarded ours, for which we are laid under very great <HI>Obligations</HI> of <HI>Grati∣tude</HI> to them.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, I don't doubt but Mr. <HI>S.</HI> meant well, but he has sometimes an unhappy Way of expressing his good <HI>Intention.</HI></P>
<P>But our Author proceeds to another Paragraph of my <HI>Sermon, Page</HI> 11. where I thus represent the sad Consequences of neglecting <HI>Self-defence;</HI>
<Q>If it be not lawful to oppose by Force unjust Inva∣ders, then the <HI>Goods</HI> of <HI>Providence</HI> are vouch∣safed to us in vain, and Men of the strictest <HI>Inte∣grity,</HI> and Females of the most unblemish'd Vir∣tue,

will ever be expos'd as an easy <HI>Prey,</HI> to the vilest Insults of the most scandalous <HI>Scoundrels!</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon which our <HI>Author</HI> observes as follows; <HI>p.</HI> 10, <Q>If th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> extraordinary Consequences are <HI>true,</HI> what a st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong <HI>Faith</HI> in, and Dependance upon God do those manifest, who have embraced, and do religiously maintain the peaceable <HI>Doctrine?</HI></Q></P>
<P>To which I reply, That his saying the Conse∣quences I drew are <HI>extraordinary,</HI> without offering any other Reason, does not prove the Point; and the very contrary follows, from these Consequences, to what our <HI>Author</HI> imagines; for this Reason, If the exposing of our <HI>Goods</HI> and <HI>Honour,</HI> continually without <HI>Necessity,</HI> to the <HI>Insults</HI> of <HI>Scoundrels,</HI> be <HI>true Consequences</HI> of the <HI>Neglect</HI> of <HI>Self-defence;</HI> then it cannot be that the Premises from which such absurd Consequences flow, should be Good, or from <HI>God;</HI> and consequently has no Promise of <HI>Protection</HI> annexed to it, without which it is <HI>Pre∣sumption</HI> to depend on <HI>God</HI> in any Case.</P>
<P>It is true the <HI>Power</HI> of God is such, that he can if he pleases make Millions of <HI>Worlds</HI> more than there be, may we therefore expect that he will? No; it is a vain Confidence to expect <HI>Protection,</HI> out of the Way of proper Means. When <HI>Satan</HI> tempted our <HI>Saviour</HI> to cast himself down from the <HI>Pinacle,</HI> and yet expect <HI>Protection,</HI> he rejected the Motion.</P>
<P>There is no Instance in the Sacred <HI>Volume,</HI> of the Preservation of any in a Time of Danger and <HI>Calamity,</HI> but of such who had been, or were using proper <HI>Means</HI> for <HI>Defence.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean Time I trust, that a Number of the <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>others,</HI> who from a Conscience misin∣formed do oppose War, have true and saving <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ, and are upright before God in the general

I wou'd only observe, That seeing the Dispersion of that <HI>Naval Armament,</HI> happened on the very E∣vening of that <HI>Day</HI> which was appointed by the <HI>Go∣vernment</HI> for <HI>Publick Prayer</HI> and <HI>Humiliation</HI> in NEW-ENGLAND, for Defence against that formida∣ble Squadron<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">What Queen Elizabeth said of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Armada, may be apply'd to the Fleet of <HI>Jebucta;</HI> Affiavit Deus, et dissipantur; <HI>God</HI> blew with his Wind, and they were scattered.</NOTE>; it may commend to our Esteem and Observance, such publick Solemnities upon pro∣per Occasions: But if there had been no <HI>Preparati∣on</HI> made for <HI>Defence,</HI> by the Inhabitants of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> Colony, in providing the proper In∣struments of War, is it not highly probable, that the aforesaid <HI>Fleet,</HI> would have rather entered the <HI>Bay</HI> of BOSTON, than the <HI>Haven</HI> of <HI>Jebucta?</HI></P>
<P>Give me Leave likewise to observe here, <HI>en pas∣sant,</HI> that Almighty GOD has put such singular Ho∣nour, especially of late, upon that <HI>pious, generous, praying,</HI> and <HI>warlike People,</HI> above the other <HI>Pro∣vinces</HI> on this <HI>Continent,</HI> not only in the Instance before mentioned, but also in taking the important Fortress of CAPE-BRETON, that Time itself will not be able soon to efface the Memory of those great <HI>E∣vents:</HI> What ardent <HI>Piety,</HI> in amiable Union with the most heroick <HI>Bravery,</HI> opened all their Charms, in the <HI>High-places of the Field!</HI> when the intrepid Sons of <HI>New-England,</HI> nobly attack'd the aforesaid almost impregnable Fortress!

<P><PB N="26" REF="006247_0030_1028203E4598A9B8"/>Our Author proceeds next to remark upon a Pa∣ragraph of the Sermon about <HI>Self-murder, Ser. p.</HI> 12, 13. which runs thus;</P>
<P><Q>He that suffers his Life to be taken from him, by One that hath no Authority for that Purpose, when he might preserve it by Defence, incurs the Guilt of <HI>Self-murder:</HI> Since <HI>God</HI> hath enjoined him to seek the Continuance of his <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>Na∣ture</HI> itself teaches every Creature to defend itself when assaulted: In Particular, Nature hath not only given to Man a quick Sense of <HI>Injuries,</HI> that he might not suffer himself to be oppressed and in∣sulted, but she hath also <HI>armed</HI> him with <HI>Strength</HI> and Ability of <HI>Body,</HI> that he should not be forced tamely and sordidly to submit! Tho' there is a Self-love that is criminal and vicious, <HI>viz.</HI> That which hath no Regard to the <HI>Honour, Safety</HI> and <HI>Interest</HI> of our Neighbour; yet there is a <HI>Self-love</HI> that is rational and excellent, which inclines us primarily to regard our own: And hence is that of the Apostle, <HI>That no Man ever yet hated his own Flesh, but nourisheth and cherish∣eth it;</HI> if so, then it is every Man's Duty to <HI>love</HI> his own <HI>Life,</HI> to desire its Continuance, and use proper <HI>Means</HI> for its Preservation; for this Pur∣pose the Almighty hath put into our <HI>Nature,</HI> a Principle that desires <HI>Life,</HI> avoids Death, and is afraid of its Approaches; for which Reason, it is call'd the <HI>King of Terrors.</HI></Q></P>
<P>My Opponent is pleas'd to remark, upon the a∣foresaid Parrgraph, in the following Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>This Author should have consulted the Mean∣ing of Self-murder, before he used the Term so freely in several Parts of this Sermon—Murder is defin'd to be a wilful and felonious killing another, upon prepensed Malice, <HI>&amp;c. Felo de se,</HI> or a Self-murderer, is he that commits Felony, by wil∣lingly
<PB N="27" REF="006247_0031_1028203FCFC7A470"/>
and deliberately killing himself: So that the Case in the Sermon does not reach this Descripti∣on, unless we can suppose, he who does not en∣deavour to defend himself, is unactive from a wil∣ful deliberate Desire of being killed. It is with∣out Doubt every Man's Duty to use proper Means for the Preservation of Life; but if any Man is convinced that Christ hath forbidden him the Use of military Preparations, and yet will use them, they are to him very improper Means, <HI>Mat.</HI> xvi. 25.26.</Q></P>
<P>To which I reply, as follows, namely, That these <HI>Arguments,</HI> in my Opinion, support the Charge in the preceding Paragraph:</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Command</HI> of <HI>God</HI> to seek the Continu∣ance of <HI>Life.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI>'s teaching the Reasona∣bleness of <HI>Self-defence,</HI> from the <HI>Example</HI> of the <HI>Brute-creation,</HI> as well as from the <HI>Sense</HI> of <HI>Injuries,</HI> which is natural to Men, and the <HI>Ability</HI> given by the <HI>Almighty</HI> whereby they might resist them.</P>
<P N="3">3. The reasonable <HI>Self-love</HI> that is recommended in the divine Oracles.</P>
<P N="4">4. The natural <HI>Desire</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> implanted in the <HI>human Nature.</HI></P>
<P>All these our Author acknowledges by his Si∣lence; and only offers three Exceptions against the Consequence I draw from them. The</P>
<P N="1">1. Of which is a <HI>Definition</HI> of <HI>Self-Murder,</HI> ex∣tracted, I suppose, from some <HI>Law Book;</HI> which is this, <Q>A Self-murderer, is he that commits Fe∣lony, by willingly and deliberately killing him∣self.</Q></P>
<P>To which I answer, That our Author by his own <HI>Pen</HI> proves the <HI>Charge;</HI> because the <HI>Definition</HI> he offers of <HI>Self-murder,</HI> is applicable in some Degree to the <HI>Neglecters</HI> of <HI>Self-Defence: For,</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="28" REF="006247_0032_1028204386508808"/>1. They willingly and deliberately hold a <HI>Princi∣ple,</HI> contrary to the Use of an apt <HI>Mean</HI> to preserve <HI>Life</HI> in <HI>Danger.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In Pursuance of this <HI>Principle,</HI> they are here supposed to neglect that <HI>Mean</HI> willingly, when the Use of it is necessary and seasonable.</P>
<P N="3">3. The necessary <HI>Consequence</HI> of which is their <HI>Death;</HI> which must therefore be charged upon them, at least in some <HI>Measure,</HI> so long as it is just and reasonable to believe, that a <HI>Premises</HI> contains in it its just and natural <HI>Consequences;</HI> or a <HI>Cause</HI> its na∣tural <HI>Effects;</HI> that is, so long as Men are rational, and intelligent Beings.</P>
<P N="4">4. It ought also to be considered, that he who doesn't endeavour to <HI>prevent</HI> an <HI>Evil,</HI> which it is, under God, in his Power probably to prevent, by the Use of an apt <HI>Mean,</HI> not forbidden, is Partaker of that <HI>Evil, Eph.</HI> v. 11. <HI>Have no Fellowship with the unfruitful Works of Darkness, but rather reprove them;</HI> that is, says Mr. <HI>Poole,</HI>
<Q>Not only do not practise them yourselves, but do not join with o∣thers in them, by Consent, Advice, Assistance, or any other Way, whereby ye may be defiled by them;—but convince them, not only by your Words, but especially by your Actions, which be∣ing contrary to them, will both evidence them to be, and reprove them, as being Works of Dark∣ness.</Q></P>
<P>Supposing a <HI>Magistrate</HI> should suffer gross Wick∣edness complained of and proved, to pass trium∣phant, without opposing it, without inflicting the <HI>Penalty</HI> prescribed by the <HI>Law,</HI> woudn't he be a Partaker thereof, <HI>and bear the Sword in vain?</HI> And isn't the Case the same as to <HI>Heads</HI> of <HI>Families,</HI> when they don't labour to check with Force and Se∣verity growing <HI>Evils</HI> in their <HI>Houses,</HI> when other Means fail of Success?</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="006247_0033_1028204980D6F740"/>Wasn't <HI>Eli</HI>'s excessive <HI>Mildness</HI> and <HI>passive Beha∣viour</HI> towards his <HI>Sons,</HI> the Cause of his <HI>Grief</HI> and their <HI>Ruin?</HI> See 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> ii. 22—24. <HI>Nay, my Sons, said he, it is no good Report that I hear; ye make the Lords People to transgress. Eli</HI>'s Sin, says Mr. <HI>Poole,</HI> in this Matter, was not only that he <Q>Re∣proved them too gently, but especially, that he contented himself with a <HI>verbal</HI> Rebuke, and did not restrain them, as is said, Chap. iii. 13. <HI>For this the Almighty told him, that he would judge his House for ever.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Surely, as <HI>Solomon</HI> observes, <HI>He that spareth his Rod, hateth his Son, but he that loveth him, chast∣neth him betimes,</HI> Prov. xiii. 24. Hence we may see how hateful to <HI>God,</HI> and pernicious to <HI>Men,</HI> the Doctrine and Practice of absolute <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> are. If <HI>Resistance,</HI> and all Use of <HI>Force,</HI> be a <HI>Sin,</HI> it must be of Consequence sinful for <HI>Parents</HI> to <HI>correct</HI> their <HI>Children,</HI> and <HI>Masters</HI> their <HI>Servants;</HI> yet these Things are commanded; it must therefore be a <HI>Sin</HI> to obey the positive <HI>Commands</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> upon the aforesaid <HI>Hypothesis.</HI> Can we think that such an unaccountable <HI>Doctrine</HI> can come from <HI>Heaven,</HI> as makes the <HI>Almighty</HI> contradict himself, who is all Wisdom and Harmony in his <HI>Perfections,</HI> his <HI>Pre∣cepts,</HI> and all his <HI>Government!</HI> A Doctrine that not only tends to overthrow all <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> in the <HI>State,</HI> but to destroy at a Stroke all <HI>Family Go∣vernment</HI> and <HI>Order!</HI></P>
<P>Whatever Influence <HI>Instruction</HI> and <HI>Example</HI> may have upon some <HI>ingenuous Minds,</HI> to form them to Virtue and Piety, yet others, of a more obstinate <HI>Turn,</HI> are like to be ruined, unless they be learned <HI>Wisdom</HI> by <HI>Stripes.</HI></P>
<P>Unless <HI>Correction</HI> had been necessary, an <HI>All-wise God</HI> would have never commanded it.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="006247_0034_1028204CA14F5FD0"/>Surely the Passion of <HI>Fear</HI> was not put into the human <HI>Soul</HI> by the <HI>Author</HI> of Nature in vain; no, but for valuable Purposes, both in respect of <HI>Socie∣ty</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI> As a Consequence of this I may say,</P>
<P N="5">5. That he who suffers such, whom he has Rea∣son to conclude have a murderous Intention to assas∣sinate him, and consequently without <HI>Resistance</HI> to kill him, may be said <HI>interpretatively</HI> to consent to their murderous <HI>Design;</HI> because he opposes not, by all proper <HI>Means</HI> in his <HI>Power,</HI> the Execution of it. But to proceed:</P>
<P>The second Exception of our <HI>Author</HI> against the Charge aforesaid, is his Reasoning from the Descrip∣tion of Murder already mentioned, in the following Manner, <HI>namely,</HI>
<Q>That the Case in the Sermon does not reach the aforesaid Description, unless we can suppose, he who does not endeavour to de∣fend himself, is unactive, from a wilful and deli∣berate Desire of being killed.</Q></P>
<P>To which I answer, That he who willingly and deliberately uses a <HI>Mean,</HI> and that from a fixed <HI>Prin∣ciple,</HI> that has a natural Aptness to answer a certain <HI>End,</HI> does at least <HI>virtually</HI> aim at the <HI>End</HI> to which the Mean tends, and so is chargeable with the Conse∣quence, whether he actually aims at the End or not; because he is a <HI>rational Creature,</HI> who ought to act with <HI>Discretion</HI> and <HI>Design.</HI> If he doesn't actually aim at the <HI>End,</HI> to which the <HI>Mean</HI> he uses has a natural Fitness, it argues Weakness of <HI>Mind,</HI> to choose <HI>Means</HI> that verge to an End he dislikes: However, if the aforesaid Person doesn't aim at his own <HI>Death</HI> actually, notwithstanding of the Weak∣ness and Inconsistency that attend his <HI>Conduct,</HI> yet the <HI>Malignity</HI> of the <HI>Crime</HI> is no doubt lessened in <HI>Degree,</HI> because that lies much in Intention. In the mean time, as the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> informs us, <HI>Who∣soever
<PB N="31" REF="006247_0035_1028204E246CDFF8"/>
beareth the Sound of the Trumpet, and taketh not Warning, if the Sword come and take him away, his Blood shall be upon his own Head.</HI></P>
<P>Supposing a pious Person abstains totally from <HI>Food,</HI> with a religious Design, to be conformed to the <HI>Example</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Fasting,</HI> and presumptuous∣ly expecting to be miraculously supported without <HI>Food</HI> for Forty Days, dies in that Space, woudn't he be guilty of <HI>Self-murder</HI> in some Degree, tho' his Crime is not so heinous and aggravated, as if he de∣signed his own <HI>Death?</HI> But I proceed to the third Exception, which is this: <Q>It is without doubt, says our <HI>Author,</HI> every Man's <HI>Duty</HI> to use proper <HI>Means</HI> for the Preservation of <HI>Life;</HI> but if any Man thinks that <HI>Christ</HI> hath forbidden him the Use of <HI>military Preparations,</HI> and yet will use them, they are to him very improper <HI>Means.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here observe, that in the aforesaid Paragraph our <HI>Author tacitly</HI> acknowledges the Lawfulness of <HI>mili∣tary Preparations</HI> in themselves, as <HI>Means</HI> to pre∣serve Life; and that it is every Man's Duty to use them, who reckons them lawful; which is indeed a giving up of his whole <HI>Cause.</HI> Great is the Power of <HI>Truth</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Magna est veritas, &amp; prevalebit.</NOTE>. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. He concludes, <Q>That any One who is convinced that <HI>Christ</HI> hath forbidden him the Use of military <HI>Preparations,</HI> they are to him improper Means.</Q> It is very true, they are so, at that Time, till he is better instructed; for doubtless it is a Sin to act con∣trary to <HI>Conscience,</HI> and therefore it is a necessary <HI>Duty,</HI> in such a Case, to use with Speed and Im∣partiality, all proper <HI>Means</HI> to obtain <HI>Light</HI> from <HI>God!</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI>'s citing <HI>Mat.</HI> xxv. 26. and <HI>Poole</HI>'s Annotations upon the Place, to prove that we <Q>Shou'dn't act contrary to <HI>Conscience,</HI> in order to
<PB N="32" REF="006247_0036_1028204FC385EE88"/>
escape <HI>Sufferings</HI> upon a <HI>religious Account,</HI></Q> is quite foreign to the <HI>Point</HI> in <HI>Question,</HI> which is strictly and properly a <HI>civil</HI> and not a <HI>religious Mat∣ter:</HI> Who denies that we shou'dn't suffer patiently upon the <HI>Score</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> when called thereto by divine <HI>Providence?</HI> If the <HI>Magistrate</HI> under which we live, shou'd <HI>persecute</HI> us, because of our religi∣ous <HI>Principles</HI> or <HI>Practice,</HI> no doubt we should en∣dure it with Calmness and Meekness; but this is very different from our being <HI>passive</HI> under the <HI>Vio∣lence</HI> of a foreign <HI>Foe,</HI> who comes to <HI>rob</HI> us of our <HI>Goods,</HI> and therefore jumbling those Things toge∣ther, that are so very different, serves only to de∣ceive the unwary <HI>Reader!</HI></P>
<P>But our <HI>Author</HI>'s following Paragraph, is very unjustifiable, namely this, <Q>That if any sincere Christian understands it to be his <HI>Duty,</HI> not to make any <HI>Defence</HI> at all, his forbearing to use any, will never incur Guilt.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Tho' <HI>Ignorance</HI> of the <HI>Evil</HI> of any <HI>Crime,</HI> and a false <HI>Perswasion</HI> consequent upon it, do, if the <HI>Ignorance</HI> is not <HI>affected</HI> and wilful, lessen its <HI>Ma∣lignity,</HI> yet they cannot totally remove it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because that <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Error</HI> are Sins themselves, <HI>Isa.</HI> xxvii. 11. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> ii. 1. and there∣fore can't take away the Guilt of other Sins, or jus∣tify our Conduct in following the aforesaid <HI>blind Guides.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Because the <HI>holy Scriptures</HI> are the supream <HI>Rule,</HI> which we are bound to search and understand, especially in Things of great Moment, and to which we ought to be conformed, both in <HI>Sentiment</HI> and <HI>Practice, Isa.</HI> viii. 20. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 16, 17. and <HI>Conscience</HI> is but a subordinate or <HI>ruled Rule; For God is greater than our Conscience, and knoweth all Things,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 20.</P>
<P N="3">3. Things of a <HI>moral Nature,</HI> are either good or
<PB N="33" REF="006247_0037_10282052D4F3FBB0"/>
bad in themselves, antecedent to, or before our Tho'ts about them; nor can our Opinion alter their <HI>Nature.</HI> If our <HI>Ignorance</HI> or wrong <HI>Perswasion</HI> do justify wholly a continued <HI>Neglect</HI> of <HI>Duty,</HI> or <HI>Sin</HI> of <HI>Omission;</HI> by a Parity of Reason, they may justify a <HI>Sin</HI> of <HI>Commission;</HI> and if one, why not an∣other? And consequently the Guilt of all Crimes, yea the greatest, will be removed by what is criminal, which is very absurd!</P>
<P>This Notion will justify <HI>Saul</HI>'s persecuting the primitive <HI>Christians</HI> from <HI>City</HI> to <HI>City,</HI> even unto <HI>Death! For he verily tho't with himself, that he ought to do many Things contrary to the Name of Je∣sus of Nazareth, Acts</HI> xxvi. 9. which is very shock∣ing!</P>
<P>This Notion likewise justifies all the <HI>Persecutions,</HI> or <HI>Sufferings</HI> upon a <HI>religious Account,</HI> which the <HI>Quakers</HI> have endured, at any Time or Place, since they have appeared in the World; in case that those who oppressed them, tho't it their <HI>Duty</HI> so to do, which Charity obliges us to hope they did, at least some of them.</P>
<P>Now why does our Author appear as an <HI>Advo∣cate</HI> for the <HI>Quakers</HI> unattack'd, and yet in the mean Time, hold a <HI>Principle,</HI> that in its natural Conse∣quences, justifies all their unreasonable Sufferings? Is this rational? Is this consistent?</P>
<P>Our Author takes Notice of another Passage in the Sermon, <HI>p.</HI> 13. <HI>viz.</HI> this, <Q>Well, if <HI>Self-mur∣der</HI> be a heinous Sin, it will follow by the Law of Contraries, that Self-defence is an important Duty: Surely he who is unjustly attacked, and does not endeavour by suitable Means to preserve his Life, especially if there be any probability of Success, in so doing betrays it, and so is guilty of <HI>Suicide;</HI> a Crime of the first Magnitude and deepest Dye!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Upon this Passage (faith our Author) I would
<PB N="34" REF="006247_0038_10282055DB9CC190"/>
remark, that frequently the most suitable Means to preserve Life, when attacked, is to deliver up that for which the Attack is made.</Q></P>
<P>I answer, 1. Sometimes the <HI>Attack</HI> is with a ma∣licious Design to <HI>murder:</HI> and then if that be deli∣vered up, for which the Attack is made, the <HI>Life</HI> itself must be given up.</P>
<P N="2">2 If the <HI>Attack</HI> be for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and we tamely de∣liver them up, without <HI>Resistance,</HI> do we not here∣by encourage the Wickedness of the Wicked, and wrong ourselves and Families (and that perhaps in Matters of such great Importance as ruin both, and are these Things just and good?</P>
<P>But our Author proceeds to say, <Q>If however I were thus attacked by <HI>Villains,</HI> who were so wick∣ed as to determine to take away my <HI>Life,</HI> were I in the meek and peaceable Disposition, which the Gospel inculcates, I believe that would have such an Effect upon the worst of Men, that it would disarm their Malice; but if it did not, my sub∣mitting calmly, and resigning my Life, rather than running the Risque of taking away another's, would be so far from <HI>Suicide,</HI> that it would be acting agreeable to the Nature and Temper of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and consequently <HI>highly rewardable.</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">What our Author Means by <HI>highly rewardable,</HI> I don't certainly know; I would hope that he is not for the <HI>Popish</HI> Doctrine of the Merit of good Works, I acknowledge that the Doctrine of absolute <HI>Non-resistance,</HI> deserves a Reward, but of a different Kind from what he, I suppose, intends.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>To which I reply, that there are these <HI>Defects</HI> in the aforesaid Paragraph, which render it inconclu∣sive, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>Miracle</HI> is expected without a <HI>Promise,</HI> which is <HI>presumptuous.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Question</HI> in Debate is begged, that should be proved, which is unfair, <HI>viz.</HI> That the
<PB N="35" REF="006247_0039_1028205B24EE9AE8"/>
Neglect of <HI>Self-defence</HI> upon a proper Occasion, is agreeable to the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Temper</HI> of the <HI>Gospel.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It seems to be here suppos'd, that the <HI>Gospel</HI> Dispensation, strictly so called, is different in Na∣ture from the <HI>Jewish,</HI> which is <HI>untrue,</HI> as appears from the <HI>Appendix</HI> annexed to my Sermon, which our Author tho't proper not to meddle with in his <HI>Animadversions,</HI> and yet takes for granted what it opposes.</P>
<P N="4">4. It seems to suppose, as if our <HI>Author</HI> imagined that his <HI>meek</HI> and peaceable <HI>Disposition</HI> wou'd have more Influence upon <HI>Villains</HI> than the meek <HI>Temper</HI> of our <HI>Saviour</HI> and his <HI>Apostles,</HI> which is <HI>absurd!</HI> For their Malice was not disarm'd by the latter, and how then is it probable it shou'd by the for∣mer?</P>
<P>I heartily wish that the <HI>Gentleman,</HI> my <HI>Opponent,</HI> and all of his <HI>Principles,</HI> may never have their Per∣swasion put to the <HI>Trial,</HI> upon such melancholy Occasions!</P>
<P>To what has been said under this Head, of <HI>Self-murder,</HI> I would add the following Observation of Mr. <HI>Poole</HI> in his <HI>Synopsis; Thou shalt not kill,</HI> that is, unlawfully; <Q>This Precept (saith he) treats concerning all these Things which in <HI>Scripture</HI> are called <HI>Murder;</HI> nor are we to imagine that <HI>Divini∣ty</HI> treats no otherwise of <HI>Murder</HI> than civil or hu∣man <HI>Laws;</HI> one of the original Words, properly signifies an unjust killing<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In hoc precepto agitur, de omnibus iis, quae sub Homicidii no∣mine, in Scriptura veniunt; nec putandum, non aliter Theologia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> agere de Homicidio, quam <HI>Jurisprudentiam: RATSACH</HI> propri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ficat occisionem injustam.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>So that our Author finds Fault with me, for keeping within my own proper <HI>Province,</HI> and speak∣ing like a <HI>Divine</HI> from the Desk, and not like a <HI>Lawyer</HI> from the <HI>Bench</HI> or <HI>Bar,</HI> in a <HI>Sermon</HI> upon the
<PB N="36" REF="006247_0040_1028205E831A3850"/>
Point in <HI>Controversy;</HI> which, whether it be a just <HI>Censure,</HI> let others judge.</P>
<P>As to the Instance of the Night <HI>Robber,</HI> mentio∣ned in the <HI>Sermon, p.</HI> 12, in the <HI>Vindication, p.</HI> 13. I shall for the sake of Brevity only mention Mr. <HI>Poole</HI>'s Annotations on the Place (<HI>Ex.</HI> xxii. 2) which I think sufficiently solve the Difficulty our Author has started, and add a few Words; <Q>For the Thief (says Mr. <HI>Poole</HI>) tho' he be killed by a Man in his <HI>own Defence,</HI> because in that Case, the Thief might be presumed to have a worse Design, and the Owner of the House cou'd neither ex∣pect, nor have the Help of others, to secure him from the intended Violence; nor guide his Blows with that Discretion, which in the Day Time he might use; <HI>If the Sun be risen, there shall be Blood shed for him; he that kills him, shall be put to Death.</HI> Because he punished him more than his Crime de∣served, and might have been otherwise either se∣cured, or righted; and in that Case, it is proba∣ble, the Thief design'd not <HI>Murder,</HI> but <HI>Theft</HI> only; but if it were evident that the House-break∣er design'd Murder, he might doubtless <HI>kill him</HI> in his <HI>own Defence.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Augustine</HI> gives this Reason why the Law of <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> allow'd of killing a <HI>Thief</HI> in the <HI>Night,</HI> but not in the Day; <Q>Because (says he) after Sun-rising, a Man might distinguish whether the <HI>Thief</HI> came to <HI>kill,</HI> or barely to steal; in the latter Case, he was not to be killed.</Q>
<HI>In Quest.</HI> 84, <HI>on the Book of Exodus.</HI></P>
<P>I might add hereto, the Sentiment of the famous <HI>Rabbi Maimonides,</HI> who may be reasonably suppo∣sed to understand thoroughly the political Laws of his own Nation; he observes, <Q>That no private Person was permitted to kill another, except in
<PB N="37" REF="006247_0041_10282061B82DBAA8"/>
Defence of that which if once lost is irreparable, as Life and Chastity.</Q></P>
<P>To what has been said, I shall only add, That our Author, in his <HI>Gloss</HI> aforesaid, has been so un∣happy, or rather happy, in his Manner of Expres∣sion, as to give up the <HI>Cause</HI> for which he contend∣ed; for by his <HI>Pen</HI> he has acknowledged the <HI>Ne∣cessity</HI> of <HI>Self-defence,</HI> in these Words, (<HI>V. p.</HI> 14) '<HI>Whilst the Owner of the House was making a ne∣cessary 'Defence:</HI> Sound Doctrine indeed; <HI>Truth</HI> will out sometimes: Now if the <HI>Gentleman</HI> wou'd but stand by this, our Controversy would soon come to a comfortable Period; which I am not without Hopes it will.</P>
<P>He next proceeds to consider a Query I propo∣sed under the Margin of the 12 <HI>p.</HI> from <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 36. where Christ enjoins his Disciples, <HI>That each of them who wanted a Sword, should sell his Coat and buy one;</HI> from which I propose this Query, <Q>If Christ was against all Fighting and War, to what Purpose did he counsel his Disciples to buy <HI>Swords, must they be bought and never used, or bought for nothing?</HI></Q></P>
<P>Our Author answers, <HI>Vind. p.</HI> 14. <Q>That we have no Account of the Disciples ever using <HI>Swords</HI> after Christ's Ascension; and we have seve∣ral very strong Intimations that they did not, which sufficiently demonstrates that they did not under∣stand the <HI>Text</HI> in its present literal Acceptation.</Q></P>
<P>To which I reply, by way of Query,</P>
<P N="1">1. Where are those several very strong Intima∣tions that our <HI>Author</HI> speaks of? Why did not he mention some of them?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 2. Was it any more lawful to have <HI>Swords</HI> before Christ's Ascension, than after? If this be sup∣posed, pray what is the Reason?</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="006247_0042_102820633A1A09E8"/><HI>Query</HI> 3. Didn't Christ suffer some of his <HI>Disci∣ples</HI> to wear <HI>Swords</HI> before his <HI>Ascension</HI> without Re∣proof? Now, wherefore were they suffered to wear them? Was it for <HI>Ostentation,</HI> or <HI>Defence</HI> in their <HI>Travels?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 4. Was that a <HI>spiritual Sword</HI> with which <HI>Peter</HI> struck off <HI>Malchus</HI>'s <HI>Ear?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 5. If we take the <HI>Sword</HI> in a spiritual Sense, why not the <HI>Coat?</HI> Doesn't it seem hard and unprecedented, to take two Words joined in one Sentence in different Senses? Well, if we take the Word <HI>Coat</HI> in a spiritual Sense, as well as the <HI>Sword,</HI> and consider that the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> is com∣pared to a <HI>Garment,</HI> and likewise <HI>Holiness</HI> in <HI>Scrip∣ture,</HI> and that the Word written is termed a <HI>Sword,</HI> will not the Sense be this, That we should part with the <HI>Robe</HI> of Christ's Righteousness, or the Garment of <HI>Holiness</HI> in order to buy <HI>a Bible, and is this a reasona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Bargain?</HI></P>
<P><Q>It is probable at least, saith <HI>Grotius,</HI> that some of the <HI>Apostles</HI> wore <HI>Swords</HI> in travelling, in the Sight, and with the Knowledge of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> during the whole Time they accompanied him; which <HI>Josephus</HI> informs us, other <HI>Galileans</HI> also did, in their <HI>Journey</HI> from their own Country to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> (the Roads being much infested with <HI>Highwaymen</HI>) and who also tells us the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Essenes,</HI> the most quiet and peaceable of all Men <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De Bell. Jud. Lib. <HI>2.</HI> Cap. <HI>1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE>. Hence it came to pass, that when <HI>Christ</HI> told his Disciples, such a Time was at hand, <HI>That they should sell even their Garments, to buy Swords,</HI> the Apostles presently answered, That there were two <HI>Swords</HI> in their Company, and in that Com∣pany there were none but the <HI>Apostles.</HI></Q> They un∣derstand their Master as speaking of <HI>temporal Swords,</HI> and he did not reprove them. Perhaps it may be
<PB N="39" REF="006247_0043_10282064CA4F57E0"/>
suggested, that <HI>Christ</HI>'s saying, it was enough, im∣plied a <HI>Reproof;</HI> I answer, no, not at all; for two Swords were enough for that little Company for the present to guard them from the <HI>Robbers,</HI> while they kept together; but when they parted, and travell'd two and two in Company, it was but proper they should have more.</P>
<P>As to the Gloss of those Gentlemen (who carried on the Annotations begun by Mr. <HI>Poole</HI>) which is mentioned by our <HI>Author,</HI> tho' they are inclined to take the Passage in a spiritual Sense, yet they signify that others were of another Mind, and only say, that it was difficult to reconcile their Sense of the Words to the <HI>Apostles</HI> Practice, and to the last Words of our Saviour, <HI>It is enough:</HI> But they don't say it is <HI>impossible;</HI> and if they had, they would have been very much mistaken. For my part, I can't but think a much greater <HI>Difficulty</HI> attends their Sense of the Words. Mr. <HI>Poole</HI> in his <HI>Synopsis</HI> upon the Place speaks thus: <Q>He does not so much exhort them to oppose Force by Force, as from a Foresight of the Enmity they were to be exposed to, to repress their private Animosities or Resentments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Non tam bortatur eos, ut vim vi repellant, quam ut appre∣hensione communis contra ipsos inimicitiae, propriam inter se animosi∣tatem reprimant.</NOTE>:</Q> This includes the Sense I have been pleading for.</P>
<P>But famous GROTIUS is still more express, and takes the Words absolutely in their plain literal Sense; <Q>Let him, saith he, by all Means get a <HI>Sword;</HI> if it cannot be had otherwise, even by the <HI>Sale</HI> of his <HI>Garment;</HI> whoever has a <HI>Purse,</HI> let him take it, with the <HI>Scrip,</HI> and whoever has no Sword, let him rather sell his <HI>Coat</HI> than want One; for this is the <HI>Custom</HI> of Mankind, when <HI>Violence</HI> is fear'd <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Omnino gladium sibi comparet, veste divendita, si aliter com∣parere non potest, quisquis crum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m babet sumet eam, sed simul cum para; et quisquis non habet, potius vestimentum divendeat, quam gladio careat, id anim <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> est facere, queties vis timetur.

<P><PB N="40" REF="006247_0044_1028206B268E4128"/>Here let me propose a few Queries, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 1. Is it not most safe to take Places of Scripture in their literal Sense, when it involves no Absurdity, and is not contrary to the <HI>Analogy</HI> of <HI>Faith?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 2. Doesn't <HI>Grotius</HI>'s Sense of the Text a∣foresaid, agree best with the <HI>Context?</HI> Where <HI>Christ</HI> says, <HI>When I sent you without Purse or Scrip, lack∣ed ye any Thing? But now he that hath a Purse, let him take it; and likewise his Scrip, and he that hath no Sword, let him sell his Garment, and buy One.</HI> If the <HI>Sword</HI> be taken in a spiritual Sense in the latter, why not the <HI>Purse</HI> and <HI>Scrip</HI> in the former? And then wou'dn't it follow, that CHRIST sent forth his <HI>Apostles</HI> into the <HI>Ministry</HI> without necessary spiritual Qualifications, which is not true!</P>
<P>Give me leave to mention some <HI>Hints</HI> of an inge∣nious <HI>Pen</HI> upon this Head, not long since inserted in the <HI>Gazette;</HI> his <HI>Strokes</HI> methinks are pertinent and pungent!</P>
<P>He justly observes, that these Words of <HI>Christ</HI> to <HI>Peter,</HI>
<Q><HI>Put up again thy Sword into his Place,</HI> con∣vey an <HI>Idea</HI> very different from laying it aside for ever as unlawful; do they not rather hint, that the <HI>Sword,</HI> when in its proper Place, is ready upon a suitable Occasion; <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 35, we find very plainly <HI>Christ</HI>'s Opinion of the Necessity of having <HI>Swords</HI> in these Words; <HI>When I sent you without Purse, and Scrip, and Shoes, lacked ye any Thing? And they said, Nothing.</HI> This was done when our Lord sent his Disciples, Chap. x. 1. into every City and Place whither he himself would come; but now when the Lord is about to be offered up, and his Disciples are to remain in the World, it
<PB N="41" REF="006247_0045_10282070879792B0"/>
seems they are not to expect a <HI>miraculous Support</HI> and <HI>Defence;</HI> for <HI>Christ</HI> says, Chap. xxii. 36. <HI>But now, he that hath a Purse, let him take it, and like∣wise his Scrip; and he that hath no Sword, let him sell his Garment, and buy One; (He that hath a Purse, let him take it)</HI> Money, it seems, in the tedious Journey of human Life, was lawful and necessary <HI>(and likewise his Scrip)</HI> Provisions or Food were also <HI>(and he that hath no Sword, let him sell his Garment, and buy One)</HI> but a <HI>Sword</HI> was lawful, and still more necessary, even of great∣er Consequence than our very <HI>Clothes;</HI> and the Experience of Christians, from that Time down to the present, may be appealed to, Whether Mo∣ney and Provisions have not been found very use∣ful, and, in many Cases, the <HI>Defence</HI> of Mens <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Liberties,</HI> of greater Consequence than <HI>Food</HI> or <HI>Raiment;</HI> agreeable to our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Words in another Place, Is not the Life more than Meat, and the Body than Raiment?</Q>
<HI>Mat.</HI> vi. 25.</P>
<P><Q>Yet how punctually do some <HI>Christians</HI> perform the first and second Parts of this Injunction? Very diligently they provide <HI>Purse</HI> and <HI>Scrip,</HI> yet ne∣glect that most necessary Provision the <HI>Sword,</HI> not∣withstanding <HI>Food</HI> and <HI>Raiment</HI> are represented by Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist of so much less Consequence than <HI>Life,</HI> which, under Providence, is protected and defend∣ed by the <HI>Sword,</HI> and (on account of its signal Use no doubt) is commanded to be purchased at the Expence of our <HI>Garments.</HI> It has been already shewn, that Christianity was not to be forced upon People by the <HI>Sword;</HI> what better Use then re∣mains, than the <HI>Defence</HI> of our <HI>Country,</HI> and the <HI>Protection</HI> of the <HI>Helpless</HI> and <HI>Innocent?</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Should some object on the Answer, Verse 38. <HI>Lord, behold here are two Swords, Christ said, It is enough;</HI> let them remember, that the <HI>Propor∣tion</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="006247_0046_102820727A244700"/>
which was adjusted for the Disciples, is enough in most well peopled Countries.</Q></P>
<P>Our Author next cites a Sentence of my <HI>Sermon, p.</HI> 14. which is this; <Q><HI>War</HI> was lawful under the <HI>Old Testament Dispensation,</HI> and therefore is lawful under the <HI>New.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon which he remarks as follows; <Q>Let us see how this extraordinary Inference will hold in other Cases; <HI>Burnt-Offerings, Sacrifices</HI> and <HI>Circumci∣sion,</HI> were lawful under the Old Testament Dispen∣sation, are they therefore so row?</Q>
<HI>Vind. p.</HI> 15.</P>
<P>I answer; If our Author had not dealt unfairly with my Paragraph, in breaking the Connection of the <HI>Jewish Dispensation</HI> and <HI>moral Law</HI> apparent in it, which I formed with <HI>Design,</HI> and so put a Sense upon it contrary to what he might see was my In∣tention in the next Page, where I express the <HI>Limi∣tation</HI> I had in View in writing the aforesaid Words; <HI>namely</HI> this, <HI>in Things of a moral Nature:</HI> I say, if he had taken notice of that, it would have spoiled his vain <HI>Triumph</HI> about <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> which had no o∣ther Foundation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t his own <HI>Oversight,</HI> or some∣thing worse, but I would hope the former!</P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> next proceeds to animadvert upon my <HI>Argument</HI> from the sixth <HI>Command,</HI> S. p. 14. which is this: <Q>The <HI>sixth Commandment</HI> does undoubtedly imply a lawful <HI>War;</HI> for if we must not kill o∣thers, much less ourselves; and if we must have no Hand in our own <HI>Death,</HI> we must defend our Lives against <HI>Violence,</HI> which sometimes cannot be done without <HI>War.</HI> Now, the blessed <HI>Jesus</HI> never came to destroy the <HI>moral Law,</HI> or the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> which is in Substance the same, but to fulfil it: <HI>Do we make void the Law by Faith</HI> (or by the Doctrines of the Gospel) says the Apostle? No; <HI>but we establish the Law. Moral Precepts</HI> are grounded upon invariable <HI>Equity,</HI> upon the
<PB N="43" REF="006247_0047_102820762488B8E0"/>
Nature and Reason of Things, and so cannot be alter'd.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Foundations</HI> or <HI>Grounds</HI> of the aforesaid <HI>Rea∣soning,</HI> which proves <HI>Defensive War</HI> to be implied in the <HI>sixth Command,</HI> are these, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Reasonable <HI>Love</HI> to ourselves, in a <HI>Degree</HI> su∣perior to others. If we must not kill others, much less ourselves; why? Because we must love our∣selves more in <HI>Degree</HI> than them. Now, does our Author deny, either that we should <HI>love</HI> ourselves at all, or in a <HI>Degree</HI> superior to others? No!</P>
<P N="2">2. Another <HI>Ground</HI> is the <HI>Necessity</HI> of our avoid∣ing having a Hand in our own <HI>Death;</HI> from which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inferred, by the <HI>Law</HI> of Contraries, that we should preserve our <HI>Lives:</HI> What can be more plain?</P>
<P N="3">3. Another <HI>Ground</HI> is the intrinsick <HI>Equity</HI> of this <HI>Precept,</HI> and its Confirmation by the <HI>Gospel.</HI> Now▪ can any Reasoning be built upon firmer <HI>Foundation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> than these mentioned? Does our <HI>Author</HI> deny those <HI>Principles</HI> I reason from? No! Well, isn't my Reasoning from them just and natural, thus, If we must not <HI>kill</HI> others, because we <HI>love</HI> them; much less ourselves, because we <HI>love</HI> ourselves more in <HI>De∣gree.</HI></P>
<P>Farther; If we must have no <HI>Hand</HI> in our own <HI>Death,</HI> we must <HI>defend</HI> ourselves against unjust <HI>Vio∣lence:</HI> The Reason of the Consequence is the <HI>Law</HI> of Contraries, which always holds good <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Duo contradictoria, non possunt esse simul vera;</HI> Two Con∣tradictories cannot be together true.</NOTE>. The <HI>Negative,</HI> in the very Nature of Things, necessarily implies the <HI>Positive;</HI> if we are altogether <HI>passive,</HI> when formidably attacked, and suffer our <HI>Death</HI> to be compassed without resisting, when we can resist, we virtually consent to it.</P>
<P>Now, are not the <HI>Reasons</HI> of these Consequences just and clear? Does our <HI>Author</HI> deny them in par∣ticular?
<PB N="44" REF="006247_0048_10282079D5667C30"/>
No! Well, seeing he grants the <HI>Premisses,</HI> from which I argue, and offers nothing in particular against the <HI>Reasons</HI> of the <HI>Consequence,</HI> it will hold good, he cannot avoid it. If the aforesaid <HI>Princi∣ples</HI> be not plain and self-evident, and the Conse∣quences or Deductions from them just and clear, I know not what is.</P>
<P>Well, but our Author doesn't like it: Why so? Hear his own Words, <HI>Vind. p.</HI> 15, 16.</P>
<P><Q>There are such strange <HI>Absurdities</HI> in this Man∣ner of <HI>declaiming,</HI> and drawing Conclusions, a Man must be very blind that cannot see them. A posi∣tive <HI>Precept</HI> is made to imply its direct <HI>Reverse:</HI> A Commandment not to kill, is implied to autho∣rize Killing: And in Consequence thereof the bles∣sed <HI>Jesus</HI> is supposed to approve of <HI>War.</HI> Whe∣ther this be agreeable to his <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Doctrines,</HI> the Reader is desired to consult.</Q></P>
<P>To which I reply as follows, Stay, <HI>Sir,</HI> and cool a little; why so hasty? why so hot? Take care that the Charge of <HI>declaiming</HI> does not turn upon your∣self, which it will do unavoidably, if you don't give good Reason for your Censure.</P>
<P>Let us therefore examine the Strength of our Au∣thor's Reasonings against the Consequence aforesaid. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. He says, <HI>Vind. p.</HI> 16. 'A <HI>positive Precept</HI> is made to imply its direct <HI>Reverse.</HI>'</P>
<P>I answer no, not at all, unless it be in <HI>Sound,</HI> not in <HI>Substance</HI> or <HI>Reality:</HI> 'Tis true, it forbids the killing of any unjustly, and yet at the same time <HI>en∣joins,</HI> or allows of the just killing of <HI>Criminals</HI> by the <HI>Magistrate,</HI> but inasmuch as this <HI>killing</HI> and not <HI>killing</HI> respect different <HI>Persons,</HI> and contrary <HI>Cau∣ses,</HI> it implies no Contradiction. But if our Author does not like this <HI>Solution</HI> of the Difficulty he starts, will he please to excuse me, if I venture to turn his
<PB N="45" REF="006247_0049_1028207D6CBBACE8"/>
GREAT GUN upon himself, not to hurt him, but to convince him of his Mistake, and see how he will like it. <Q>There are such strange Absurdities in this Manner of declaiming, and drawing Conclusions, a Man must be very blind that cannot see them.</Q>
<HI>E. G.</HI> The sixth Command, with its Threatening, according to our Author's Judgment, is thus, <HI>Thou shalt not kill;</HI> but if thou dost, thou shalt be <HI>killed</HI> by the Hand of the Magistrate (if he does not deny all civil Government, he must own this) then the Consequence comes upon himself; he makes <HI>posi∣tive Precept</HI> to imply its direct <HI>Reverse;</HI> in a Com∣mandment not to <HI>kill,</HI> he imagines that an authori∣zing of killing is implied; I leave it to our Author's <HI>Prudence</HI> to clear himself in what Way he sees best.</P>
<P>As to his Query afterwards, <HI>Vind. p.</HI> 16. <Q>And in Consequence thereof the blessed <HI>Jesus</HI> is suppo∣posed to approve of War. Whether this be a∣greeable to his <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Doctrines,</HI> the Reader is desired to consult.</Q></P>
<P>I answer, The blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> in his <HI>Doctrine,</HI> ex∣plained and confirmed the <HI>moral Law;</HI> this he him∣self informs us, <HI>He came not to destroy, but to fulfil;</HI> he likewise solemnly assures us, <HI>That till Heaven and Earth pass, one Jot, or one Title, shall in no wise pass from the Law—and that whosoever therefore shall break one of the least Commandments, and shall teach Men so, he shall be called the</HI> LEAST <HI>in the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> Mat. v. Now, was not the <HI>Life</HI> of Christ agreeable to his <HI>Doctrine?</HI> Yes surely.</P>
<P>If our <HI>Author</HI> doesn't like this Answer, he must chuse one for himself; for the aforesaid Query con∣cerns him in Effect as much as me.</P>
<P>I may likewise for the sake of Brevity, leave his other following Query to himself to Answer, in a Consistency with his Doctrine of <HI>killing Criminals</HI> by
<PB N="46" REF="006247_0050_1028207EEEBD2238"/>
the Magistrate, or his Order, which is the same Thing.</P>
<P><Q>Where there is one (saith our Author, <HI>V. p.</HI> 16) who take it in its first Sense (<HI>i. e.</HI> the Sixth Command as forbidding War) slain, are there not many Thousands of the latter killed in the Prac∣tice of Fighting?</Q></P>
<P>I Answer, It may be so; but in the mean Time, if those that hold the Doctrine of absolute Non-Re∣sistance, are not slain, they have Reason to thank those under GOD for their <HI>Protection,</HI> who hold <HI>Defensive War,</HI> and therefore shou'dn't slight them, and condemn them upon that Account!</P>
<P>Farther, if our <HI>Author's</HI> Observation be just, as it probably is, then the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of absolute <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> is a <HI>Flesh-pleasing</HI> Doctrine; seeing that it tends to save the <HI>Cash,</HI> and (in some Sense) to protect the <HI>Buff,</HI> tho' ingloriously; I confess it passes my Understanding to perceive much <HI>Spiritu∣ality</HI> and <HI>Self-denial</HI> in such Matters; but I leave it to every one to judge for himself; and pro∣ceed.</P>
<P>Our Author complains of my Explication of <HI>Prov.</HI> xxii. 3. in his <HI>V. p.</HI> 16. and observes, <Q>That I make hiding one's self, and preparing for De∣fence, so exactly alike, that they are taken the one for the other.</Q></P>
<P>I Answer, They are, in my Opinion, alike; for he that rightly prepares for <HI>Defence,</HI> provides a <HI>Hiding-place</HI> from the Enemy, a <HI>Fort</HI> and Instru∣ments of <HI>War,</HI> to screen him from their <HI>Vengeance;</HI> and are not these Things the Intention of a <HI>Hiding-place,</HI> viz. to <HI>conceal</HI> and <HI>protect?</HI></P>
<P>Here I may enquire how can a prudent Man, who, according to the common Course of Things, foresees temporal Danger and Calamity approaching,
<PB N="47" REF="006247_0051_10282082127743B0"/>
rationally hide himself, in the <HI>Neglect</HI> of the afore∣said Method?</P>
<P><Q>He foresees the <HI>Evil</HI> both of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Punish∣ment</HI> which he is like to incur, by considering <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>History,</HI> and the natural Tendency of <HI>Causes;</HI> he foresees those <HI>Evils</HI> that he may shun them; he betakes himself to a <HI>Place</HI> of <HI>Safety,</HI> as is done in a <HI>Tempest</HI> or in <HI>War:</HI> He declines the Occasions of <HI>Sin,</HI> and av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <HI>Dan∣ger</HI> from himself; he <HI>hides</HI> himself till the Indig∣nation of God or Man be overpast; says <HI>Mercer</HI> and <HI>Jejerus.</HI> See 1 <HI>Kings</HI> xvii. 3. <HI>Isa.</HI> xlvi. and xxxii. 2. <HI>Mat.</HI> x. 23.</Q></P>
<P><HI>But the Simple pass on and are punished;</HI>
<Q>Pass∣ing they are punished,' say <HI>Junius</HI> and <HI>Tremelli∣us.</HI> 'While they go rashly and imprudently, wherever their Minds lead them, and pass secure∣ly, they are punished,' says <HI>Piscator.</HI> 'They cast themselves into <HI>Danger,</HI>' saith <HI>Vatabulus.</HI> Like <HI>Travellers,</HI> who not perceiving their <HI>Danger,</HI> do not labour to shun it, saith <HI>Marian</HI> and <HI>Casta∣lio.</HI> 'They pass on to Evils, which thro' their <HI>Folly</HI> they don't foresee; or, having foreseen them, have slighted them,' saith <HI>Mercer.</HI> 'They go on boldly and carelessly in their customary <HI>Road,</HI>' saith <HI>Jejerus. 'And are punished;</HI> being involved in Misery, and oppressed, they pay the Punishment of their Imprudence, saith <HI>Mercer.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But our Author proceeds to mention the follow∣ing Paragraph of my Sermon, <HI>p.</HI> 14. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Now if the Almighty has approved of War formerly, and there is still the same Necessity of it, under the Gospel-Dispensation as before, it will follow, that it is equally lawful now: It is absurd to suppose, that the blessed God, who is infinite in Wisdom, and unalterable in his Nature, would determine contrarily at different Periods of
<PB N="48" REF="006247_0052_1028208785831E18"/>
Time, concerning a Case that is substantially the same!</Q></P>
<P>Upon which our Author remarks as follows, <Q>If this Manner of Arguing proves any Thing, it proves Offensive War, as lawful as De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ive. God approved of the <HI>Israelites</HI> taking away the Possessions of many Nations: He commanded them to destroy some utterly; is it therefore e∣qually lawful to do so now, whether we have this Command or not?</Q></P>
<P>To which I reply, That Almighty GOD never commanded <HI>Offensive War</HI> (properly and strictly so called) Perhaps this may be reckoned by some a <HI>Paradox;</HI> but I think it is a plain Truth; the aforesaid Instances are not <HI>Offensive War,</HI> which is the unjust <HI>Invasion</HI> of another's <HI>Right;</HI> for the blessed God, who is the absolute and original <HI>Pro∣prietor</HI> of all, transferred the civil <HI>Right</HI> of those Nations, which they forfeited by Sin, to the Peo∣ple of <HI>Israel,</HI> previous to, or before their taking Possession thereof; and, as absolute <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> and a righteous <HI>Governor</HI> and <HI>Judge,</HI> for their ex∣traordinary <HI>Wickedness,</HI> gave his People <HI>Israel</HI> Au∣thority and Commission to punish them, and put them to Death. In the former Instance, they did but take forcible Possession of their own Country and Goods; and in the latter, they were but <HI>Executio∣ners</HI> of <HI>judicial Punishment</HI> under a proper <HI>Authori∣ty,</HI> and therefore there was nothing of <HI>Offensive War</HI> in those Things.</P>
<P>The <HI>Almighty</HI> never did, nor, to speak with Re∣verence, ever can, in a Consistency with the <HI>Purity</HI> and Perfection of his <HI>Nature,</HI> enjoin such a <HI>wicked</HI> and abominable Thing as <HI>Offensive War!</HI></P>
<P>It is true the Manner of conveying the aforesaid <HI>civil Right,</HI> and <HI>penal Authority,</HI> was extraordinary and immediate, peculiarly suited to that Dispensa∣tion,
<PB N="49" REF="006247_0053_1028208D1834F9C8"/>
which was a <HI>Theocracy, God</HI> himself being their <HI>King,</HI> in an extraordinary and immediate Way; a Priviledge which no other Nation ever had, or, so far as we know, are like to have.</P>
<P>And therefore not only <HI>civil Rights,</HI> and <HI>judicial Power</HI> and Authority, are conveyed always <HI>mediate∣ly</HI> to other Nations, by ordinary human <HI>Means,</HI> ac∣cording to the different <HI>Laws,</HI> Constitutions and Customs of Countries; but also the claiming the afore∣said <HI>Rights,</HI> and exercising the aforesaid <HI>Authority,</HI> must be <HI>mediate</HI> also, regulated by human <HI>Reason,</HI> agreeable to the <HI>Laws</HI> of different <HI>States</HI> and <HI>King∣doms.</HI></P>
<P>Hence if the <HI>Almighty</HI> should in an extraordinary and immediate Manner, give to any a <HI>Right</HI> to o∣thers <HI>Possessions,</HI> there wou'd be Need of infallible and immediate <HI>Revelation,</HI> to assure us of this Mat∣ter; nor could we safely act before it, in either of of the above Instances.</P>
<P>But there is no Need of immediate Revelation, to inform or assure us of these <HI>civil Rights,</HI> or <HI>civil Authority,</HI> which are convey'd to us in an ordinary <HI>Channel,</HI> we are apt to know them full well with∣out.</P>
<P>Nor need we any new <HI>Revelation</HI> to inform us of a <HI>Truth</HI> that is engraven with indelible Charac∣ters upon our rational Natures, as with the Point of a <HI>Diamond,</HI> and written with a <HI>Sun-beam</HI> upon a great Variety of Pages in the sacred Volume; namely, That we should <HI>defend</HI> ourselves and <HI>Properties.</HI></P>
<P>Nor do we need a new <HI>Revelation</HI> to instruct us, when to prepare for, and endeavour the aforesaid <HI>Defence,</HI> the <HI>Providence</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> together with our own <HI>Reason,</HI> will easily, when attended to, point out the <HI>Time,</HI> as they do in other temporal Cases.</P>
<P>As to our <HI>Author</HI>'s hard Construction upon these Words, '<HI>Only Barrier,</HI>' in my Sermon, <HI>p.</HI> 5. <HI>V.
<PB N="50" REF="006247_0054_1028208E9A57D5E0"/>
p.</HI> 17. and the Use he is pleased to make of it, I shall only say, that the aforesaid Errata of the <HI>Press,</HI> in leaving out the Word <HI>Sometimes,</HI> our Author may see corrected by the Press in divers of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; the Sentence in the original Manuscript runs thus; 'Which is <HI>sometimes</HI> the <HI>only Barrier;</HI>' but if the aforesaid Word hadn't been corrected, our Author might easily know, from the <HI>Series</HI> of the <HI>Discourse,</HI> my Meaning to be only this, That sometimes <HI>Self-defence</HI> is the only human or outward <HI>Barrier</HI> against <HI>Injustice</HI> and <HI>Violence;</HI> now seeing the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Cha∣rity</HI> oblig'd him to put the most favourable Sense upon the Words that they can in Reason bear, I leave it to the Reader to judge, whether such Ma∣nagement be a Commendation of our Author's Cause or Candour.</P>
<P>But to proceed; my <HI>Opponent</HI> mentions another Paragraph of the Sermon, <HI>p.</HI> 15. <HI>Vin. p.</HI> 18. which is this;</P>
<P><Q>It is strange to think, and hard to reconcile it with any just Notion of divine Goodness, that Almighty God, shou'd under this last and brightest Dispensation of his Grace towards the Children of Men, instead of enlarging diminish our <HI>Priviledges,</HI> and that in so tender and impor∣tant a Point! Indeed, methinks such a Notion tends to cast a dishonourable and inglorious Re∣flection upon the divine Benignity and Goodness; and the most illustrious Display of it, that was e∣ver given to the Children of Men, by the <HI>Gos∣pel</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ.</Q></P>
<P>Upon which he remarks as follows; <HI>V. p.</HI> 18. <Q>What Priviledges are here meant, those of <HI>Fight∣ing</HI> for our Possessions, <HI>gaining Riches,</HI> enjoying Estates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Tho' Riches acquired by honest Means, may not be inconsistent with the Doc∣trines of Christ; and tho' we may possess in the
<PB N="51" REF="006247_0055_10282090561A8608"/>
World many near and dear Enjoyments, yet <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Testimony</HI> ought to be <HI>preferred</HI> a∣bove all Things, if we would render ourselves ac∣ceptable in his Sight, <HI>Luke</HI> xiv. 26.</Q></P>
<P>To which I reply, that there are these following <HI>Blemishes</HI> in the aforesaid <HI>Paragraph,</HI> as I appre∣hend; namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>Misrepresentation</HI> of the <HI>Point</HI> in <HI>Debate;</HI> here it is hinted as if what I was contending for, was, in Part, <HI>gaining Riches,</HI> which implies an <HI>Offensive War;</HI> now this was expresly guarded against, in stating the Question in the Beginning of the Ser∣mon, in the Negative there mentioned.</P>
<P N="2">2. A <HI>begging</HI> the <HI>Question</HI> in <HI>Controversy,</HI> which shou'd be proved; for he here takes that for grant∣ed, which I deny; namely, That the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>absolute Non-resistance,</HI> is the <HI>Testimony</HI> of <HI>Christ;</HI> and then reasons upon it, to the Terror of the Igno∣rant, which is very unfair.</P>
<P N="3">3. By the <HI>Application</HI> of <HI>Luke</HI> xiv. 26. to his Purpose, he makes the Doctrine of <HI>absolute Non-resistance,</HI> or the <HI>Neglect</HI> of one outward <HI>Mean</HI> for <HI>Self-defence,</HI> one <HI>Term</HI> of Christianity; insinuating, that one can't be a Disciple of Christ without it, or true Christians, and resign'd to the Will of God, which is very uncharitable!</P>
<P N="4">4. He <HI>shifts</HI> the <HI>State</HI> of the <HI>Question,</HI> which is not whether God can make us comfortable in those common <HI>Afflictions,</HI> which we are liable to, consider'd as <HI>private Men,</HI> by the Course of <HI>Providence;</HI> or which we may suffer as <HI>Christians</HI> upon a <HI>religious Account,</HI> which is term'd <HI>Persecution:</HI> But whe∣ther as a <HI>State</HI> or Community we shou'd endeavour to <HI>defend</HI> ourselves by <HI>Force,</HI> when Necessity re∣quires, against a <HI>foreign Foe,</HI> who endeavour to <HI>rob</HI> us of our <HI>Goods</HI> and <HI>Lives,</HI> under no religious Pre∣text?</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="006247_0056_1028209410B36018"/>The next Particular that our Author considers, is what I have said, S. p. 15, 16. which is this; <Q>Why, my Brethren, should it be now a Sin to perform (in respect of Things of a moral Nature) that which was under the <HI>Jewish Dispensation</HI> a Sin to neglect? Was not <HI>Meroz</HI> exposed to a bitter <HI>Curse, because she came not to help the Lord against the Mighty?</HI> i. e. as appears by the Context, Be∣cause they came not to assist their Brethren engaged in <HI>Battle</HI> in a good <HI>Cause.</HI> Is not <HI>God</HI> the same as formerly, and the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Injustice</HI> the same? Did not the <HI>Jews</HI> live under the same <HI>moral Law</HI> that we are to be governed by? And had they not the same <HI>Gospel</HI> for Substance?</Q></P>
<P>Upon which our Author remarks in the following Manner, <HI>Vind. p.</HI> 20.</P>
<P><Q>The first of these Questions I really think not applicable to the Point in Dispute; because there is not any Part of the <HI>moral Law</HI> which <HI>enjoins War:</HI> And the Reason why <HI>Meroz</HI> was so severely <HI>cursed, Poole</HI> says, was to shew the Sinfulness and Unreasonableness of their cowardly Desertion of this Cause, because it was the Cause of God; and they had the Call of God to it, whom they knew to be able easily to crush that Enemy whom they dreaded, and who had promised to do it: So that upon this View of the Case, there is this only pro∣ved by the <HI>Parallel,</HI> That it is a <HI>Sin to neglect going to War in the Cause of God, when he calls to it:</HI> This, therefore, cannot at all operate against those who refuse Fighting, because they apprehend God hath forbidden it.</Q></P>
<P>To which I reply, by offering the following Par∣ticulars to the <HI>Reader</HI>'s Consideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. That our <HI>Author begs the Question</HI> in <HI>Debate; namely,</HI> That not any Part of the <HI>moral Law</HI> en∣joins <HI>War.</HI> Whether a <HI>Defensive War</HI> be not implied
<PB N="53" REF="006247_0057_102820991D7AD448"/>
in, and consequently enjoined by the <HI>sixth Command,</HI> I leave to the Reader to determine, after a View of the Reasonings I have before offered upon that Head, together with what is said in the Sermon to the same Purpose upon the fifth Command, p. 15, 16, 17, which our Author has thought proper not to meddle with, for what Reasons he knows best.</P>
<P N="2">2. My <HI>Opponent,</HI> in the aforesaid Paragraph, re∣ally, as I conceive, gives up the <HI>Cause</HI> for which he contends; for he acknowledges that this is proved by the <HI>Parallel</HI> of <HI>Meroz,</HI> namely, <Q>That it is a Sin to neglect going to War in the Cause of God, when he calls to it.</Q></P>
<P>And only endeavours to screen himself from the Consequence of the aforesaid Concession, by this slender Pretext, <HI>namely,</HI>
<Q>This cannot at all operate against those that refuse fighting, because they ap∣prehend God hath forbidden it.</Q> This Argument I have before considered—to which I refer the Read∣er, and shall only add a few Words, together with the Sentiment of <HI>Grotius</HI> upon this Head.</P>
<P>The aforesaid Pretext or Apology, directly tends, so far as I can see, intirely to overthrow all the in∣trinsick or <HI>inward Goodness</HI> or <HI>Badness</HI> of <HI>human Ac∣tions,</HI> and consequently to make both <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> a mere <HI>Nose</HI> of <HI>Wax!</HI></P>
<P><Q><HI>Grotius,</HI> speaking of just Wars, observes, that they are in holy Writ called <HI>Battles</HI> of the Lord, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xvii. 47. The <HI>Israelites,</HI> saith he, under the Conduct of <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Joshua,</HI> having by Force of Arms repelled the <HI>Amalekites,</HI> who attacked them, <HI>Exod.</HI> xvii. GOD approved of the <HI>Conduct</HI> of his People, tho' he had given no <HI>Orders</HI> upon that <HI>Head</HI> before the <HI>Action.</HI> And farther, God himself prescribed to his People certain general and established <HI>Rules</HI> of making War, <HI>Deut.</HI> xx. 10, 15. thereby plainly shewing, that <HI>War</HI> might
<PB N="54" REF="006247_0058_1028209F3890E178"/>
sometimes be <HI>just,</HI> even without <HI>a special Command from God;</HI> for there he makes a manifest Diffe∣rence between the Case of those seven Nations, and that of other People: And seeing he does not de∣clare the just Reasons of making <HI>War,</HI> he hereby supposes, that they may be easily discovered by the Light of Nature: Such was the Cause of the War made by <HI>Jephtha</HI> against the <HI>Ammonites,</HI> in <HI>Defence</HI> of their <HI>Borders, Judges</HI> xi.</Q> But,</P>
<P N="3">3. From Mr. <HI>Poole</HI>'s Annotations upon the Case of <HI>Meroz,</HI> which I had not cited in my Sermon, nor don't remember I had read, our Author is pleased to take Occasion to reflect under the Mar∣gin, <HI>Vind. p.</HI> 20. upon many of the <HI>People</HI> of my <HI>Profession,</HI> as <HI>cowardly,</HI>
<Q>when many of the same <HI>Profession</HI> with this <HI>Sermon-writer</HI> hid themselves.</Q></P>
<P>To which I reply, that it seems something strange and extraordinary in this <HI>Gentleman</HI>'s Conduct, who appears as a <HI>Patron</HI> for the Doctrine of <HI>absolute Non-Resistance,</HI> that he should not only enter into an <HI>Offensive War</HI> with me, and slight me unpro∣voked, but likewise cast <HI>Scandal</HI> and <HI>Reproach</HI> upon many Persons, whom I have the Honour of being related to by <HI>Profession,</HI> who were long since dead, and in their <HI>Graves,</HI> and so could not possibly offend him <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mortuus non mordet;</HI> A dead Man does not bite. <HI>De mor∣tuis &amp; absentibus, nil nisi bonum dicito;</HI> Concerning dead and absent Persons, say nothing but Good.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I do declare, that I had it not in the Thoughts of my <HI>Heart,</HI> to offer any <HI>Charge</HI> against the People of his <HI>Profession</HI> about <HI>Cowardice,</HI> and therefore was not a little surprized to meet with our Author's <HI>Animad∣versions</HI> upon this Head!</P>
<P>But seeing this <HI>Gentleman</HI> is pleased to insinuate a <HI>Charge</HI> of <HI>Cowardice</HI> against many of the same Pro∣fession with me (and brings some <HI>Authors</HI> of his own
<PB N="55" REF="006247_0059_102820A111794C10"/>
Perswasion to prove it) I would only observe in their Vindication, that the <HI>Instance</HI> alledged of their <HI>hid∣ing</HI> themselves (in a Time of <HI>Persecution,</HI> is no Proof of it; forasmuch as it is but agreeable to the Direc∣tion of our <HI>Lord Jesus,</HI> who counsels his <HI>Disciples, when they are persecuted in one City, to fly to ano∣ther.</HI></P>
<P>And pray, have not divers of both our <HI>Profes∣sions</HI> actually done so (for Substance) at the Time of the first Settlement of this Country? Did they not fly from their native Soil on <HI>Canvas</HI> Wings a∣cross the great <HI>Atlantick,</HI> to this then howling <HI>Ame∣rican Wilderness,</HI> in order to find a secure <HI>Retreat,</HI> from the Tempest of <HI>Persecution?</HI></P>
<P>Is this Instance of our Author's Conduct calm and consistent? I will assure him, that the <HI>Sermon</HI> he is displeased with, was not framed to serve the narrow and comparatively mean <HI>Designs</HI> of a <HI>Party,</HI> but to promote the common <HI>Benefit</HI> of all the <HI>Societies</HI> of the <HI>Province,</HI> in their <HI>Protection</HI> from impending <HI>Danger</HI> and <HI>Calamity!</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed: Our Author, in order to recon∣cile <HI>God</HI>'s commanding <HI>War,</HI> under the Old Testa∣ment, to his (supposed) prohibiting it now, proposes this Expedient, <HI>Vind. p.</HI> 20.21. <HI>namely,</HI> he <Q>be∣seeches his Readers to remember, that <HI>he suffered and required many Things of the</HI> Jews, <HI>because of the Hardness of their Hearts,</HI> which was not to continue in his Church, after the bright Discovery of his <HI>Gospel</HI> was manifested.—Is it therefore rea∣sonable to suppose, that this universal, glorious De∣sign, admits of War and Fighting, especially be∣tween such Nations as profess to be under the Go∣vernment of the same Lord and Lawgiver?</Q></P>
<P>Now, in order to shew that the aforesaid <HI>Expedi∣ent</HI> will not answer his <HI>Design,</HI> I shall first mention Mr. <HI>Poole</HI>'s Interpretation of the Place of Scripture
<PB N="56" REF="006247_0060_102820A457A43B18"/>
his Words refer to, <HI>namely, Mat.</HI> xix. 8. where Christ saith, <HI>Moses, because of the Hardness of your Hearts, suffered you to put away your Wives, but from the Beginning it was not so.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Poole</HI> observes thus upon the aforesaid Words: <Q>The Substance of our Saviour's Answer seemeth to be this, <HI>Moses</HI> gave you no positive <HI>Command</HI> in the Case, he could not make a <HI>Law</HI> directly opposite to the Law of my <HI>Father.</HI> But <HI>Moses</HI> saw the Wantonness and Wickedness of your Hearts, that you wou'd turn away your <HI>Wives</HI> without any just or warrantable Cause; and to restrain your Extravagance of <HI>Cruelty</HI> to your <HI>Wives,</HI> or disor∣derly turning of them off, upon any Occasion, he made a Law that none should put away his Wife, but upon a legal Cognizance of the Cause, and gi∣ving her a Bill of Divorce: And you by your <HI>Traditions</HI> have expounded that Law beyond <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> his Intention, and made a Bill of Divorce, grantable in Cases which he never tho't of, nor in∣tended in that Law: But the <HI>Measures</HI> of <HI>Law∣fulness,</HI> are neither to be taken from <HI>Moses</HI> his temporary <HI>Toleration,</HI> and much less from your <HI>Traditions</HI> and Expositions of the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> but from the original Institution of Marriage, and from God's original Law in Relation to it.</Q> The above Exposition of the Place, I apprehend to be just and genuine.</P>
<P>I wou'd therefore observe, that the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>V.</HI> goes upon a wrong <HI>Foundation</HI> in the aforesaid Paragraph; and hence his Superstructure cannot be good<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Stabit opus melius, si bene fixa basis, i. e.</HI> If the Foundation be well laid, the Superstructure will stand the better; but on the Contrary, <HI>Debile fundamentum fallit opus.</HI> A weak Foun∣dation ruins the Fabrick.</NOTE>. He saith that HE, meaning GOD, for of him he speaketh, as will appear to every Eye, by the Connection of these Words with the foregoing Part
<PB N="57" REF="006247_0061_102820A7C1894B98"/>
of the Paragraph, <HI>suffered and required many Things;</HI> but <HI>Christ</HI> saith it was <HI>Moses</HI> that <HI>suffered,</HI> not <HI>requi∣red,</HI> the <HI>Jews to put away their Wives,</HI> which was but one Thing; this is a strange complicated Mis∣take.</P>
<P>It is admirable that our <HI>Author</HI> shou'd ascribe to <HI>God</HI> by Way of <HI>Command</HI> (for does'nt the Word <HI>Required</HI> signify as much) what was only a tempo∣rary <HI>Permission</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> and thus contradict our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s express <HI>Declaration,</HI> in no less than three Particulars at one <HI>Dash;</HI> but I hope it was thro' Inadvertency that our <HI>Author</HI> fell into this unhappy <HI>Mistake,</HI> and that when he considers the Matter far∣ther, he will correct it.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, can it be tho't, with the least Shadow of Reason, that from such a <HI>Foundation,</HI> any good <HI>Conclusion</HI> can be drawn against <HI>Defensive War,</HI> which GOD the Father, and GOD the Son, repeatedly commanded, approved of, and encou∣raged with their <HI>Presence</HI> and <HI>Blessing</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See the Sermons upon <HI>Exodus</HI> xv. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is likewise probable that our <HI>Author</HI> meant al∣so the <HI>Jewish Ceremonies,</HI> but these Things being <HI>Shadows</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> must of Consequence expire and evanish, when the <HI>Sun</HI> the <HI>Substance</HI> came; but where is there any Ground to believe, that <HI>War</HI> is a <HI>Type</HI> of <HI>Christ;</HI> and if so, wou'dn't it conclude what my Opponent doesn't like, namely, that <HI>Christ</HI> is an eminent <HI>Warrior,</HI> seeing that the <HI>Type</HI> is eminently included in the <HI>Antitype.</HI></P>
<P>Farther, the <HI>Jewish Sacrifices</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> were Things in themselves indifferent and innocent, antecedent to, or before the divine <HI>Precepts</HI> concern∣ing them, and therefore might by divine <HI>Sovereignty</HI> be for a Time enjoined, without any Contradiction to the <HI>Purity</HI> and other <HI>moral Perfections</HI> of the divine <HI>Nature;</HI> but the Case is not so as to War, it can be
<PB N="58" REF="006247_0062_102820A9A28A8398"/>
no Matter of Indifferency in itself, for it consists not in the shedding the <HI>Blood</HI> of <HI>Beasts,</HI> but of <HI>Men;</HI> and therefore if it be not <HI>morally Good,</HI> it is <HI>morally</HI> EVIL in itself, before the divine <HI>Precept</HI> respecting it: Else there is no such Thing in any Instance, and all <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Vice</HI> are empty <HI>Names,</HI> and meer <HI>Cyphers,</HI> that have no Foundation in the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Things;</HI> and thus the very <HI>Basis</HI> of all <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> is sapp'd: A doleful Stroke indeed!</P>
<P>For what can more deeply concern the Manners of Men, than the taking away the <HI>human Life?</HI> Which puts a final <HI>Period</HI> to our State of <HI>Trial,</HI> and fixes unalterably our everlasting <HI>Condition:</HI> Hence one of these two Things follows, either that <HI>God</HI> Almighty commanded, encouraged and ap∣proved of frequently, what is in itself <HI>morally Evil,</HI> or else that <HI>Defensive War</HI> is in its own <HI>Nature, mo∣rally Good,</HI> and consequently lawful now.</P>
<P>As to the latter Part of the aforesaid Paragraph, I answer in the Affirmative; that it is, in my Appre∣hension, reasonable to suppose, that the universal glorious <HI>Design</HI> of the <HI>Gospel-Dispensation</HI> admits of <HI>Defensive War</HI> and <HI>Fighting,</HI> when Necessity requires, even between <HI>Nations</HI> that profess to be under the <HI>Government</HI> of the same <HI>Lord</HI> and Lawgiver, for these Reasons;</P>
<P N="1">1. Because it is under the aforesaid Limitations <HI>morally Good,</HI> as, I hope, appears from what has been already said. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. Because being so, it cannot of itself have a Tendency to Contention or Confusion, or any Thing that is <HI>Evil;</HI> what is Good, cannot in itself tend to what is bad; except it be supposed that a <HI>Cause</HI> produces <HI>Effects</HI> contrary in <HI>Kind</HI> to itself; which is absurd, and contrary to the very <HI>Nature</HI> of Things! For thus, upon this <HI>Hypothesis,
<PB N="59" REF="006247_0063_102820AD3165FF00"/>
Light</HI> would produce <HI>Darkness,</HI> and Darkness Light.</P>
<P>Nay, it is so far from this, that the Doctrine of <HI>Defensive War</HI> directly tends to keep the worst of Men from <HI>Injustice</HI> and <HI>Violence,</HI> by affecting their <HI>Fear,</HI> with a <HI>View</HI> of the <HI>Penalties</HI> they are like to incur thereby; this tends to teach Men <HI>Wisdom,</HI> as pious <HI>Gideon</HI> taught the Men of <HI>Succoth,</HI> with the <HI>Briars</HI> and <HI>Thorns</HI> of the <HI>Wilderness.</HI></P>
<P>Whereas the contrary Opinion, by removing the Arguments of <HI>Fear</HI> and Terror from the Impeni∣tent, which generally have the most Influence to re∣strain them from the <HI>Evils</HI> they <HI>love,</HI> tends to give an ungovernable <HI>Loose</HI> to their <HI>Passions</HI> and <HI>Appe∣tites,</HI> and so opens a <HI>Door</HI> to Violence and Confusi∣on, and every evil Work, and therefore in the pre∣sent degenerate <HI>State</HI> of Mankind, it is of dangerous and pernicious Consequence!</P>
<P>Not to add that this Method of affecting the <HI>Fear</HI> of Men, by the threatning of <HI>Punishment</HI> against Transgressors, proportioned to their Crimes, and of inflicting it when there is Occasion, and in this Way endeavouring to deter them from Iniquity; I say this is the very Method which the blessed <HI>God</HI> himself takes with Mankind, in his <HI>Word</HI> written, and by his <HI>Providence,</HI> of which there are innume∣rable Instances; Doesn't the Almighty <HI>hedge up</HI> frequently <HI>the Way of Sinners with Thorns,</HI> to keep them within proper Bounds? Does'n't the allwise <HI>God</HI> in the holy Scriptures denounce <HI>Threatnings</HI> of temporal Punishments, against Transgressors? And doesn't he at Times inflict them, and therefore from hence, may he not be justly called even now, <HI>A Man of War?</HI> And does it not easily follow, from what has been said under this Head, that all such who oppose <HI>a just War</HI> as unlawful under the <HI>Gos∣pel,</HI> do consequently (tho' I trust not designedly)
<PB N="60" REF="006247_0064_102820B31E63B960"/>
reflect upon the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of God's <HI>Government</HI> over the Children of Men, and labour to make us unlike our <HI>Maker,</HI> imagining that the <HI>Perfection</HI> of <HI>Christi∣anity</HI> consists in this Instance, in our being unlike God; a strange Sort of <HI>Perfection</HI> indeed! For my Part, I cannot but think that JEHOVAH is the <HI>Foun∣tain</HI> and <HI>Pattern</HI> of all <HI>Excellency,</HI> and that the <HI>Per∣fection</HI> of <HI>intelligent Creatures,</HI> consists in Conformi∣ty to him; but it seems our <HI>Author</HI> is in this Instance of a different Opinion!</P>
<P N="3">3. Another Reason why I think the <HI>Design</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> Dispensation admits of <HI>Defensive War</HI> and <HI>Fighting</HI> is, because the <HI>Jewish Church</HI> enjoyed the <HI>Gospel</HI> as well as we, the very same for <HI>Substance,</HI> as I have proved at large in the 16 <HI>p.</HI> of the <HI>Sermon,</HI> and in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> which he has tho't proper not to meddle with, for what Reason he knows best!</P>
<P>Our Author proceeds to cite another Paragraph of the Sermon, <HI>p.</HI> 16.</P>
<P><Q>Can we think, my Brethren, that <HI>God</HI> would enjoin and approve of any Practice formerly, that was contrary to the <HI>moral Law</HI> and <HI>Gospel,</HI> which the <HI>Jews</HI> enjoy'd? Surely No! That is contrary to his unalterable <HI>Purity,</HI> of which the <HI>moral Law</HI> is a legible <HI>Copy</HI> and <HI>Exemplar.</HI> Well, if a just <HI>War</HI> was not contrary to the <HI>moral Law</HI> under the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation, and before it, why should it be so now, in the like Circumstances of <HI>Necessity?</HI> And if it be not contrary to the <HI>moral Law,</HI> the standing and unalterable <HI>Rule</HI> of our <HI>Conduct,</HI> why should any scruple it, or oppose it now?</Q></P>
<P>Upon which our Author remarks as follows (<HI>V. p.</HI> 21)</P>
<P><Q>I have already observed, that the <HI>Almighty</HI>'s enjoining and approving of some Wars formerly, does not authorize any <HI>Wars begun and carried on at the mere Will and Pleasure of Men.</HI> The <HI>like
<PB N="61" REF="006247_0065_102820B6DCA9A198"/>
Circumstances of Necessity</HI> must be, when we have the divine <HI>Command</HI> and <HI>Direction,</HI> and not other∣wise. If it be a Doubt why the dark and distant Prospects of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which the <HI>Jews</HI> had, did not discover to them in general, that the Time should come when outward <HI>War</HI> should be laid aside, the same Difficulty recurs with respect to <HI>Sacrifices, Burnt-Offerings, Circumcision, &amp;c.</HI> and yet some of the inspired Prophets foresaw that Time. If it be objected, that <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> &amp;c. were Types and Figures; so, in my Opinion, were the outward Wars and Fightings of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and are considered in that Light, by reli∣gious Writers of many Denominations. That the <HI>moral Law</HI> is the standing and unalterable <HI>Rule</HI> of our Conduct; I grant <HI>as far as it reaches:</HI> But it is not from thence that a Scruple about Fighting arises. The blessed <HI>Jesus hath taught some Chris∣tians,</HI> both by the <HI>immediate Dictates of his Spi∣rit,</HI> and the Expressions of his Will, <HI>when perso∣nally</HI> upon <HI>Earth,</HI> that the best Way to keep the Commandments, <HI>Thou shalt not kill,</HI> and <HI>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour,</HI> is <HI>not to harbour any Ill-will or Revenge against any, but to love Ene∣mies, &amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To which I reply, That our <HI>Author</HI> in the pre∣ceding Paragraph,</P>
<P N="1">1. Shifts the Question in Controversy; I never pretended to defend <HI>War, begun and carried on at the meer Will and Pleasure of Men,</HI> or according to their Humours and corrupt Lusts: No!</P>
<P N="2">2. He gives a wrong <HI>Turn</HI> to those Words, <HI>'The like Circumstances of Necessity,'</HI> contrary to their natural and usual Acceptation, as if they signi∣fied the <HI>Time</HI> when we have an immediate <HI>Command</HI> (such as the <HI>Jews</HI> had in some Instances by the <HI>Urim</HI>) he must mean this, or say nothing to his Purpose▪
<PB N="62" REF="006247_0066_102820BB44712D30"/>
whereas the Words only signify our being in the like <HI>Danger</HI> or <HI>Distress!</HI></P>
<P>No doubt we shou'd consult the holy <HI>Scriptures</HI> in our <HI>Wars,</HI> which contain our standing <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Conduct,</HI> and consider <HI>God's Providences</HI> towards us, and <HI>pray</HI> to him for <HI>Direction,</HI> and in this Way we may expect to know the <HI>Mind</HI> of <HI>God</HI> as well as the <HI>Jews</HI> did by the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummim;</HI> nor did they in all Cases consult that <HI>Oracle,</HI> but in difficult only; <HI>When they heard that the Two Tribes and a Half had built an Altar by Jordan, the whole Congregation gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to War against them;</HI> but so far as we can learn, did not consult the <HI>Urim, Josh.</HI> xxii. 12. So like∣likewise in that <HI>War</HI> undertaken against the <HI>Tribe</HI> of <HI>Benjamin, Jud.</HI> xx. they only enquired who should go up first, <HI>v.</HI> 18. tho' after a Defeat they change the Question.</P>
<P N="3">3. Our <HI>Author</HI> puts <HI>Sacrifices, Burnt-Offerings</HI> and <HI>Circumcision</HI> upon a Par with <HI>Defensive War,</HI> and believes them to be <HI>Types</HI> and <HI>Figures;</HI> but of∣fers only his own <HI>Opinion,</HI> as the Foundation of this <HI>Argument,</HI> together with the Opinion of other religious Writers, which are no Proof to me.</P>
<P>To imagine that the <HI>Jewish Wars</HI> were <HI>Figures</HI> and <HI>Types</HI> of the spiritual <HI>Wars</HI> of <HI>Christians</HI> against <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Satan,</HI> as it wants a scriptural <HI>Foundation,</HI> so it is attended with this Absurdity, <HI>viz.</HI> It either supposes that the pious <HI>Jews</HI> had no <HI>spiritual War,</HI> which is false; or else that the Type and Thing ty∣pified (for Substance) existed together, which is ab∣surd! Besides if <HI>Defensive War</HI> be not in itself lawful, it is <HI>Murder;</HI> and methinks its hard to imagine, that a <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>merciful God,</HI> shou'd make a <HI>Type</HI> of <HI>Murder!</HI></P>
<P>Why should it be supposed, that <HI>War</HI> is any Part of the <HI>ceremonial Law,</HI> or <HI>Law</HI> peculiarly given to
<PB N="63" REF="006247_0067_102820BF348AB2E8"/>
the <HI>Jews,</HI> seeing it obtained before that Dispensati∣on, as appears by <HI>Abram's Battle?</HI></P>
<P>But if it be for Argument sake suppos'd, will our <HI>Author</HI> say that it is lawful in any Case, to offer <HI>Sa∣crifices</HI> under the <HI>Gospel?</HI> And where do we find that ever <HI>Circumcision</HI> was permitted to the <HI>Gen∣tiles?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. He asserts in other Words, that the <HI>moral Law</HI> is imperfect; he grants indeed that it is an unalterable <HI>Rule</HI> of our <HI>Conduct, as far as it reaches;</HI> this insi∣nuates that it doesn't reach far enough; and this in∣deed he elsewhere signifies, <HI>p.</HI> 44. but adds to it (<HI>i. e.</HI> to the moral Law) Love your Enemies— Now the aforesaid Assertion is contrary to the ex∣press Declaration of the holy Scriptures, <HI>Psal.</HI> xix. 7, 8. <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Our Author also insinuates, in the aforesaid Paragraph, that <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>Enemies,</HI> and not harbour∣ing <HI>Ill-will</HI> or <HI>Revenge</HI> against any, are <HI>Precepts materially new,</HI> given by our <HI>Saviour</HI> when <HI>person∣ally upon Earth,</HI> and inconsistent with <HI>Defensive War.</HI> To which</P>
<P>I reply, That these Duties were expresly com∣manded under the <HI>Jewish Dispensation,</HI> and there∣fore are not new <HI>Precepts</HI> (materially) See those fa∣mous Scriptures, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxv. 2. <HI>If thine Enemy be hungry, give him Bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him Water to drink:</HI> By <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Water,</HI> says Mr. <HI>Poole,</HI> he understands all Things necessary for his Subsistence; and likewise <HI>Exod.</HI> xxiii. 4. <HI>If thou meet with thine Enemy's Ox or Ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.</HI>
<Q>So far (saith Mr. <HI>Poole</HI> upon this Scripture) shalt thou be from <HI>revenging</HI> his <HI>Injuries,</HI> that thou shalt render <HI>Good</HI> to him for them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="006247_0068_102820C1231070C0"/>Now seeing the <HI>Almighty</HI> commanded both <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>Enemies</HI> and <HI>Defensive War</HI> under the <HI>Jewish Dispensation,</HI> then either they can consist toge∣ther, or God commanded inconsistent Things at the same Time; but seeing the latter is absurd, and conveys a <HI>horrible Notion</HI> of the <HI>blessed God</HI> as an <HI>un∣reasonable Being!</HI> the former must therefore be true.</P>
<P>Farther, let it be observed, that <HI>Love to our Neighbours as ourselves,</HI> was as expresly enjoin∣ed under the <HI>Jewish Dispensation</HI> as now: See <HI>Levit.</HI> xix. 18. <HI>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self, I am the Lord;</HI> and therefore it is consistent with <HI>Defensive War,</HI> for that was at the same Time enjoined, or else the aforesaid absurd and terrible Consequence will follow, <HI>viz.</HI> That God com∣manded contrary Things at the same Time!</P>
<P>Moreover <HI>Revenge</HI> was as expresly forbid under the <HI>Jewish Dispensation,</HI> as under the <HI>Gospel;</HI> see <HI>Lev.</HI> xix. 18. <HI>Thou shalt not avenge or bear any Grudge against the Children of thy People; Prov.</HI> xxiv. 28, 29. <HI>Be not a Witness against thy Neighbour, without Cause—Say not I will do to him as he hath done to me, I will render to the Man according to his Work.</HI> Hence one of two Things necessarily follows; ei∣ther that <HI>private Revenge</HI> is a Thing different from, and contrary to <HI>Defensive War,</HI> or that <HI>Almighty God</HI> both commanded and forbid the same Thing at the same Time; for while he forbad <HI>Revenge,</HI> he commanded <HI>Defensive War;</HI> the Absurdity of which every Eye may see!</P>
<P>Meer REVENGE, which proposes no <HI>Aim</HI> but the <HI>Grief</HI> or <HI>Destruction</HI> of him who hath hurt us, is contrary to the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The following <HI>Sentence,</HI> is a Rule of <HI>Hesiod, Oper. et Dier.

of <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>Gospel</HI> of Christ; inasmuch as it falls under the <HI>Vice</HI> of <HI>Cruelty,</HI> and is inconsistent with <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>But the Case of the <HI>Magistrate</HI> in the <HI>Execution</HI> of <HI>Criminals,</HI> is quite different, as I observed in the S. <HI>p.</HI> 32. <Q>He <HI>loves</HI> them as <HI>Fellow Creatures,</HI> and <HI>compassionates</HI> their <HI>Miseries</HI> from a Principle of <HI>Humanity;</HI> and yet in the mean Time he must put them to <HI>Death,</HI> not out of personal <HI>Revenge,</HI> but to promote <HI>Justice</HI> and the good <HI>Ends</HI> of <HI>Go∣vernment.</HI> And thus it is in respect of <HI>Self-de∣fence</HI> and <HI>War,</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> directs to fly thereto, as the last Remedy, of Necessity, <HI>S. p.</HI> 10. The Severities exercis'd thereby, should be only when the Case comes to <HI>Extremity,</HI> and our own <HI>Safety</HI> absolutely requires it, and only then <HI>as far</HI> as it does require it, and that with <HI>Reluc∣tance</HI> and <HI>Compassion, S. p.</HI> 29.</Q> So that a <HI>pri∣vate</HI> Desire of <HI>Revenge,</HI> is neither the <HI>Principle</HI> that animates <HI>Defensive War,</HI> nor the Scope to which it is directed; but a just <HI>Regard</HI> to <HI>God's commanding Authority,</HI> is the <HI>Source</HI> from which it springs, and the <HI>Protection</HI> of our own, as well as our dear <HI>Rela∣tives Persons</HI> and <HI>Properties,</HI> from unjust <HI>Violence,</HI> is the <HI>End</HI> to which it tends, and in which it termi∣nates!</P>
<P>So that <HI>Execution</HI> of <HI>Justice</HI> upon <HI>Criminals</HI> by the <HI>Magistrate,</HI> either after an ordinary <HI>Course</HI> of <HI>Trial,</HI> or by the extraordinary <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>Defensive War,</HI> is called <HI>Revenge</HI> only <HI>improperly,</HI> and in a large Sense; because of the <HI>Effect</HI> thereof, which somewhat resembles it. But in the mean Time it differs as much in its <HI>Principle</HI> and <HI>End,</HI> from what is <HI>strictly</HI> and <HI>properly</HI> called <HI>Revenge,</HI> as <HI>Light</HI> from <HI>Darkness,</HI> and therefore can consist with <HI>Love:</HI> The due Consideration of these Things, wou'd
<PB N="66" REF="006247_0070_102820CD8FAA1220"/>
prevent our being imposed upon, by a meer Sound of <HI>harsh Words.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author next proceeds to a Paragraph in the <HI>Sermon, p.</HI> 20. with which the 18 and 19 <HI>p.</HI> have a Connection, which seeing he has tho't proper, per∣haps for prudential Reasons, to give but a brief Hint of, I will take the Liberty to cite more large∣ly, as follows:</P>
<P><Q>And should not the <HI>Magistrate</HI> protect his <HI>Subjects</HI> from unjust <HI>Violence?</HI> Is not this the <HI>Design</HI> of their <HI>Office, that under them we may live quiet Lives,</HI> and that they may be to us a <HI>Hiding-place from the Wind, and a Covert from the Tempest</HI> of Op∣pression! Why else is the <HI>Sword</HI> committed to them, and can they always <HI>protect</HI> us without <HI>War,</HI> with∣out opposing Force to Force? No surely!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Now unless the <HI>Magistrate</HI> punishes <HI>Criminals</HI> in his own <HI>Community,</HI> and screens his <HI>Subjects</HI> from a <HI>foreign Force,</HI> what is his <HI>Office</HI> but an empty <HI>Name,</HI> a meer <HI>Cypher,</HI> of no Moment and Consequence to <HI>Society?</HI> Nor is it reasonable he should expect <HI>Support, Honour</HI> and <HI>Obedience,</HI> from his <HI>Subjects,</HI> if they in Consequence hereof, do not obtain <HI>Pro∣tection</HI> from him. In the mean Time it should be carefully observed, that the <HI>Magistrate's Office,</HI> and consequently the <HI>Duties</HI> of it, does not belong to the <HI>political Laws</HI> of the <HI>Jews,</HI> which were alterable, but to the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rel,</HI> which was invariable and per∣petual. Surely by the Word PARENT in the Fifth COMMAND, we are not only to understand natu∣ral, but political Parents; the MAGISTRATE is the FATHER of his COUNTRY by OFFICE, and then only indeed does he merit that honourable <HI>Character,</HI> and act up to it, when by forming and executing wholsome penal <HI>Laws,</HI> he suppres∣ses <HI>Injustice</HI> among his <HI>Children,</HI> when by prudent and necessary Preparations, and when Necessity

<P><Q>If the <HI>Magistrate</HI> may, and sometimes must use <HI>Force</HI> in suppressing <HI>Tumults,</HI> and punishing <HI>De∣linquents</HI> in his own <HI>Domains,</HI> and among his pro∣per <HI>Subjects,</HI> else all <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> must cease, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wildest <HI>Anarchy</HI> ensue; why then may he not use <HI>Force,</HI> when easier Methods avail not, in protecting them from the Insults of o∣thers? May he according to the express Word of God, punish <HI>his criminal Subjects</HI> with <HI>Death,</HI> in some Cases, agreeable to that famous Scripture, <HI>He that sheds Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed;</HI> and shall he not inflict it upon others equal∣ly guilty, especially when this becomes necessary to <HI>defend himself</HI> and his <HI>Country</HI> from <HI>Desolation</HI> and <HI>Ruin?</HI> Can it be reasonably imagined, that a <HI>Magistrate</HI> should shew greater <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Cle∣mency</HI> to Foreigners and <HI>Strangers,</HI> than to his own <HI>Sons</HI> and <HI>Subjects,</HI> to whom he is under pe∣culiar <HI>Obligations,</HI> both natural and political?</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nor has our Lord Jesus, in the New-Testa∣ment, disanulled the Magistrate's <HI>Office,</HI> which is so needful to <HI>Society;</HI> No! But on the contrary honoured and establish'd it, by his <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Example;</HI> he enjoined his Disciples, <HI>To give to Caesar the Things that are Caesar's, to give Honour to whom Honour is due, and Tribute to whom Tribute; to be subject to the higher Powers, and that for this Reason, because there is no Power but of God, and the Powers that be, are ordained of God;</HI> and he himself paid <HI>Tribute,</HI> yea rather than this important <HI>Duty</HI> should be neglected, he procured <HI>Money</HI> by a <HI>Miracle.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now let us hear how our <HI>Author</HI> answers to the aforesaid <HI>Argument,</HI> which I look upon to be the Chief that I have offered, upon which the whole
<PB N="68" REF="006247_0072_102820D0D8C79120"/>
Cause very much rests; his Answer is as follows (<HI>V. p.</HI> 22, 23)</P>
<P><Q><HI>Upon which I remark, that whenever</HI> the Ma∣gistrate is convinced that the Doctrines of Christ forbid War, it will be as much his Duty, as any other Man's, to render Obedience to those Doc∣trines. However the People called Quakers, do not undertake to condemn their Superiors engaging in War, in the present unhappy State of human Af∣fairs: <HI>We rather</HI> think it probable, <HI>that as they have shewn a noble and Christian Disposition, in granting Liberty and Protection to such as are of tender Consciences,</HI> it may please God to bless their Arms with Success, <HI>and reward them for their Kindness to his People, who desire to live in Obe∣dience to the inward Appearance of his Spirit, which leads to</HI> Purity <HI>and</HI> Perfection: <HI>And agree∣able to the Advice of the Apostle</HI> Paul, <HI>we find it our</HI> Duty, to put up Prayers for Kings, and them that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godliness and Honesty, <HI>1</HI> Tim. <HI>ii. 1, 2.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To which I reply,</P>
<P N="1">1. That if it be the <HI>Magistrate</HI>'s <HI>Duty,</HI> to <HI>render Obedience</HI> to the <HI>Doctrines</HI> that <HI>forbid War,</HI> when <HI>convinced,</HI> then he must either quit his <HI>Office,</HI> or bear the <HI>Sword,</HI> the <HI>Ensign</HI> of it, in vain; for in this Way, the <HI>End</HI> of that <HI>Institution</HI> cannot be answered; but the latter is absurd; namely, to carry an empty Title, a <HI>Name</HI> without the <HI>Thing,</HI> and therefore the former must take Place; and hence it follows, That if all <HI>Magistrates</HI> were con∣vinced as aforesaid, they must all, wou'd they act with Decency and Consistency, quit their <HI>Places,</HI> and then there wou'd be no <HI>Government</HI> at all! Doesn't therefore this <HI>Doctrine</HI> of <HI>absolute Non-Re∣sistance</HI> destroy <HI>Magistracy</HI> at a <HI>Stroke?</HI> And thus this
<PB N="69" REF="006247_0073_102820D642CE52A0"/>
<HI>Gentleman,</HI> as usual, gives up his <HI>Cause</HI> in Effect! But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Why doesn't our <HI>Author</HI> answer to my Ar∣gument from the <HI>fifth Command,</HI> in favour of the <HI>Magistrate</HI>'s <HI>Office,</HI> which I signified in the <HI>Sermon</HI> shou'd be <HI>carefully observed?</HI> Is it included or not, in that <HI>Precept?</HI> Why doesn't our <HI>Author</HI> speak out his Mind plainly? Is it the <HI>Magistrate</HI>'s <HI>Duty</HI> to <HI>protect</HI> his <HI>Subjects</HI> or not? If nay, then his <HI>Of∣fice</HI> is a meer <HI>Bubble,</HI> which only deserves to be laugh'd at; if yea, then <HI>Defensive War</HI> is included in the <HI>moral Law,</HI> and consequently is lawful now; unless it be suppos'd, that the <HI>Gospel</HI> opposes and destroys the <HI>moral Law,</HI> which as it is contrary to the express <HI>Declaration</HI> of Christ himself, elsewhere cited in this <HI>Reply,</HI> so it tends to tear up by the <HI>Roots</HI> all <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> at one dismal <HI>Dash!</HI></P>
<P>If our Author had faulted any Part of the prece∣ding <HI>Train</HI> of <HI>Reasonings</HI> about the <HI>Magistracy,</HI> he should have declared it; but seeing he has not, his Silence gives Consent to the whole, which therefore concludes to the <HI>Overthrow</HI> of his <HI>Cause!</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Our <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thor</HI> informs us, <Q>That the People called Quakers, do not undertake to condemn their Superiors engaging in War, in the present unhappy State of human Affairs.</Q></P>
<P>Well, if they don't condemn them, they justify them; for there is no <HI>Medium,</HI> unless the Mind be in Suspence and undetermin'd on which Side of the Question <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Duty</HI> lies; and if they justify their <HI>Superiors</HI> engaging in <HI>War,</HI> they cannot consist∣ently condemn <HI>Inferiors</HI> that war under them, see∣ing that <HI>Princes</HI> cannot <HI>war</HI> without <HI>Soldiers.</HI> But our Author proceeds to inform us,</P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Quakers hope for God's Blessing upon the Arms of their Superiors;</HI>
<Q>We rather think it probable, that as they have shewn a noble and
<PB N="70" REF="006247_0074_102820D8051C1330"/>
Christian Disposition, in granting Liberty and Protection to such as are of tender Consciences, it may please <HI>GOD</HI> to <HI>BLESS</HI> their <HI>ARMS</HI> with <HI>SUC∣CESS.</HI></Q> Now surely if they believed all <HI>War</HI> was unlawful, they wou'dn't, one wou'd think, ex∣pect God's Blessing upon it. They justly com∣mend the <HI>Liberty</HI> granted by the <HI>Government</HI> to <HI>tender Consciences,</HI> I join with them with all my Heart, and bless God for it, and pray that it wou'd please that Sovereign Majesty, by whom <HI>Kings</HI> reign, and <HI>Princes</HI> decree <HI>Justice,</HI> to continue it to the latest Generations even while Sun and Moon endure! I cannot but look upon <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Consci∣ence,</HI> and <HI>Protection</HI> therein, in Matters of a <HI>religi∣ous Nature,</HI> to be the unalienable <HI>Right</HI> of all <HI>Man∣kind,</HI> and the peculiar <HI>Glory</HI> of the present <HI>Reign!</HI> But,</P>
<P N="3">3. The People called <HI>Quakers</HI> (as our Author informs us) <HI>pray</HI> for the <HI>Blessing</HI> aforesaid, for ha∣ving before in the same Paragraph signified their not condemning of their <HI>Superiors engaging</HI> in <HI>War,</HI> and having expressed their <HI>Hopes</HI> of a divine <HI>Blessing</HI> up∣on their <HI>Arms,</HI> he tells us they crown all with their <HI>Prayers</HI> for <HI>such</HI> as are in <HI>Authority,</HI> and that for this <HI>Purpose,</HI> that <HI>they may live a quiet and peaceable Life; i. e.</HI> That by the Exercise of their Sovereign's Authority in Arms, accompanied with the Blessing of God, the Enemies of our Peace may be repress'd, and our Quiet restored upon a firm and honourable Basis; this I take to be the true Sense of the Para∣graph in its <HI>Connection,</HI> without the least <HI>Strain.</HI></P>
<P>This is wholesome Doctrine indeed, with which I cordially concur, and am glad to have such a <HI>Testi∣mony</HI> in favour of the late <HI>excellent</HI> ASSOCIATION; in the mean Time allow me to propose the follow∣lowing Queries; namely,</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="006247_0075_102820D9B79BB7C0"/><HI>Query</HI> 1. If this be the <HI>Quaker</HI>'s Sentiments, do they not firmly hold the Lawfulness of <HI>Defensive War</HI> under the <HI>Gospel?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 2. Then how comes our <HI>Author,</HI> who ap∣pears under the <HI>Character</HI> of their <HI>Apologist</HI> (before an <HI>Attack</HI>) to contradict them so much in his pre∣sent Performance? In his Preface he declares, that <HI>War</HI> is <HI>absolutely forbid</HI> by the <HI>Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Christ;</HI>
<Q>I thought, <HI>says he,</HI> the Sermon was to prove that agreeable to the Doctrines of Christ, which is abso∣lutely forbid thereby.</Q> Now, what was the <HI>Scheme</HI> of the <HI>Sermon</HI> to prove but <HI>Defensive War?</HI> The <HI>Title</HI> and whole <HI>Frame</HI> of it shew this. And <HI>V. p.</HI> 23. he calls it an <HI>Evil,</HI> an <HI>Apostacy</HI> from the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> a forsaking of the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of the <HI>Gospel;</HI> his Words are these; <Q>Thus the Simplici∣ty of the Gospel being forsook for worldly Pomp and Power, instead of the loving and forgiving Temper, which it enjoined, it was misconstrued to allow of Violence and Oppression in this <HI>Apo∣stacy</HI> from the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Christ;</HI> many <HI>Evils</HI> which the primitive Christians were redeem∣ed from, come to be reckoned necessary and ex∣pedient; and, speaking of the primitive Friends, he says, they were convinced by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of the Sinfulness of War.</Q></P>
<P>Yea, so great is the <HI>Evil</HI> supposed to be, that our Author informs us, <HI>Vind. p.</HI> 3. That such who hold it <HI>doctrinally,</HI> are to be excluded from <HI>Church Fellowship;</HI>
<Q>And they esteem it, saith he, their <HI>Duty</HI> to testify, that such are not in <HI>Unity</HI> with them, who, making Profession of this inward Principle, manifest a Conduct contrary to it.</Q> If so,</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 3. How can he or they forbear condem∣ning so great a <HI>Wickedness,</HI> as he represents <HI>War</HI> of all Kinds to be, if they are of the same <HI>Opinion</HI> with him? And much more, how can a Blessing
<PB N="72" REF="006247_0076_102820E0522BF270"/>
from <HI>God</HI> be expected upon what is supposed to be an <HI>abominable Iniquity,</HI> and that Blessing <HI>prayed</HI> for? I profess, it surpasses the Reach of my Understand∣ing, to reconcile these Things together!</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 4. Is there no Appearance (at least) of great <HI>Uncharitableness</HI> in the aforesaid Paragraph, in confining Persons of <HI>tender Consciences,</HI> and <HI>true Christianity,</HI> to the narrow Pale of the <HI>Quaker So∣ciety,</HI> or peculiar Principles? <HI>To his People, who de∣sire to live in Obedience to the inward Appearance of his Spirit, which leads to Purity and Perfection?</HI> Now, who can we understand by those Terms a∣greeable to our Author's <HI>Vind.</HI> but such as are for immediate <HI>Inspiration,</HI> and against <HI>Defensive War?</HI> Isn't Gratitude expressed for <HI>Liberty</HI> granted to those, and to no others; and a <HI>Hope</HI> of <HI>Success</HI> upon our <HI>So∣vereign</HI>'s <HI>Arms,</HI> grounded alone upon that <HI>Founda∣tion?</HI> Isn't this strange and hard to account for?</P>
<P>But, blessed be <HI>God,</HI> whatever our Author may imagine to the contrary, <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Sheep</HI> are not cooped up in one <HI>Fold,</HI> but scattered in many; we have Reason to rejoice that the Lord is to be our Judge, and not short sighted Creatures.</P>
<P>Here I would beg Leave to transcribe the Senti∣ment of the learned <HI>Grotius</HI> upon that famous <HI>Scrip∣ture</HI> cited by our <HI>Author,</HI> 1 Tim. ii. 1, 2, 3. <HI>I ex∣hort therefore, that first of all Supplications, Pray∣ers, Intercessions, be made for all Men; for Kings, and all in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godliness and Honesty. For this is</HI> GOOD AND ACCEPTABLE IN THE SIGHT OF GOD OUR SAVIOUR. Hence, saith <HI>Grotius,</HI>
<Q>We are taught three Things; 1. That it is pleasing to God that <HI>Kings</HI> should become <HI>Christians.</HI> 2. That being converted to <HI>Christianity</HI> they still continue <HI>Kings;</HI> which <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> thus expressed, We pray that Kings and Princes may, together with their royal
<PB N="73" REF="006247_0077_102820E864623198"/>
Power, be found to have wise and reasonable Sen∣timents<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Apol. <HI>1.</HI> p. <HI>32.</HI> Edit. Oxon.</NOTE>. And in the Book intitled, The Con∣stitutions of <HI>Clement,</HI> the Church prays, <HI>Christia∣na ta tele,</HI> for Christian Magistrates. And 3. That it is acceptable to God that Christian <HI>Kings</HI> should contribute their utmost to the <HI>Quiet</HI> of others. But how he explains this in another Place, <HI>Rom.</HI> xiii. 4. <HI>He is the Minister of God to thee for Good; if thou do Ill, be afraid, for he beareth not the Sword in vain; for he is God's Minister, an Avenger to execute Wrath upon them that do Evil. Under the Right of the Sword is figuratively comprehended eve∣ry sort of Punishment</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Translation with <HI>Barbeirack</HI>'s Notes. p. 32.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>The next Particular taken notice of by my <HI>Oppo∣nent,</HI> Mr. <HI>S.</HI> is what I have said upon the Counsel of <HI>John the Baptist</HI> to the Soldiers, S. p. 20. the Force of which he endeavours to evade by three Ex∣ceptions. 1. He says, 'They were <HI>Roman Soldiers.</HI>' Answer, What then? Should not they be told their Duty for that Reason? 2. <Q>If abstaining from War be the <HI>Perfection</HI> of the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> (says Mr. <HI>S. V.</HI> p. 23) that is a Point the most dif∣cult to be learnt, is it likely or reasonable to ex∣pect that <HI>John,</HI> upon the Pagan Soldiers first Ap∣plcation, should declare that to them?</Q></P>
<P>Answer, Here our <HI>Author,</HI> as usual, begs the <HI>Question</HI> in <HI>Dispute.</HI> I deny abstaining from War totally to be any <HI>Point</HI> of <HI>Christianity</HI> at all; it is so far from a <HI>Perfection</HI> in it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mr. <HI>S.</HI> tells us what he would do. Answer, What is that to the Purpose? It is what he should do we enquire after, and not the other. If he would not reprove Men for what he reckons sinful, who can help that? Farther, he enquires, towards the Close of his Paragraph, p. 24. Can War subsist
<PB N="74" REF="006247_0078_102820E9EB636430"/>
without Violence? Answer, Yes, without private Violence or Ravages. The <HI>Roman</HI> Laws, tho' they allowed <HI>Soldiers</HI> to take Prey from Enemies, yet did not permit the least Injury to Friends <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. Annot. Bez. &amp; Calv. in Loc.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>If these Words, <HI>do Violence to no Man,</HI> be con∣sidered in a consistent View with the other Part of the Advice, <HI>to be content with their Wages,</HI> it can reasonably be supposed to mean no more, than to abstain from <HI>private Plunders</HI> and <HI>Ravages,</HI> an <HI>E∣vil</HI> which <HI>Soldiers</HI> are at Times under strong Temp∣tations to!</P>
<P>Or that they should beware of engaging in an <HI>un∣just War,</HI> or of exercising Inhumanity and Cruelty towards those they conquered by a just One, seeing his advising them to be content with their Wages, is a tacite Approbation of that Work for which they received them.</P>
<P>The Abuses of War by some can be no just Ar∣gument against the regular Use of it. It is true, it is attended with distressing Circumstances; but it is as true, that the utter Rejection of it, and being in∣tirely <HI>passive</HI> under the <HI>Rage</HI> and <HI>Ravages</HI> of aban∣doned <HI>Banditti,</HI> is much more so; and indeed this makes us <HI>criminal,</HI> as well as <HI>miserable!</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> next attacks my Argument from the Instance of the <HI>Centurion,</HI> S. p. 21. This he en∣deavours to confute, <HI>V. p.</HI> 24, 25. The Grounds he goes upon are two, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. His usual <HI>begging</HI> of the <HI>Question</HI> in <HI>Controver∣sy,</HI> he takes it for granted, that the Denial of every kind of War is a Point of <HI>Perfection</HI> in <HI>Christianity,</HI> which I absolutely deny; and upon this <HI>Foundation,</HI> which he has offered no Arguments in his whole <HI>Performance</HI> to establish, he proceeds farther to ob∣serve, that our Lord knew the best Method to deal
<PB N="75" REF="006247_0079_102820EDCEBE3F08"/>
with frail Mortals, was to lead them by Degrees to <HI>Perfection.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer;</HI> This is not applicable to his <HI>Argument,</HI> unless he had first proved, that the rejecting of <HI>De∣fensive War</HI> was a <HI>Point</HI> of <HI>Perfection.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He labours to divert the Force of my Argu∣ment, by observing, that if the <HI>Sermon-writer</HI> could have proved, that after this Miracle, which our Lord wrought, that if the <HI>Centurion</HI> had retained his <HI>military Employ,</HI> there would have been some Foun∣dation for my Argument.</P>
<P>I reply, it is a <HI>Mistake;</HI> an Argument of Right is vastly better than from <HI>Fact,</HI> in fallible, imperfect <HI>Creatures:</HI> I enquired what was his Duty to do, and not what he did; it is not by the <HI>Examples</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> but by the <HI>Laws</HI> of God, that we should re∣gulate our Conduct!</P>
<P>Besides, seeing our Author's <HI>Opinion</HI> supposes the <HI>Repeal</HI> of an established <HI>Practice,</HI> it is his Business to shew, that the Centurion did not retain his <HI>mili∣tary Office:</HI> We do not find that <HI>Christ</HI> said a Word against his Continuance in it; No! but on the con∣trary, he elsewhere <HI>commands to render to Cesar the Things that are Cesar's;</HI> among which was the TRI∣BUTE MONEY, wherewith the SOLDIERS were SUP∣PORTED. Now, if this had been simply unlawful, would CHRIST have enjoined it for that End, with∣out <HI>Reproof,</HI> yea, and paid the <HI>Tribute Himself?</HI> Doesn't CHRIST'S PRECEPTS and PRACTICE, re∣specting the TRIBUTE MONEY, plainly imply his <HI>Approbation</HI> of a just or <HI>Defensive War?</HI></P>
<P>My <HI>Argument</HI> is not drawn from the <HI>Centuri∣on</HI>'s not laying down his <HI>Office,</HI> but from Christ's not enjoining him so to do.</P>
<P>The next Argument in the <HI>Sermon</HI> that Mr. <HI>S.</HI> is pleased to animadvert upon, is that from <HI>John</HI> xviii. 36. <HI>My Kingdom is not of this World, else
<PB N="76" REF="006247_0080_102820F1E73B8C70"/>
would my Servants fight, that I should not be deliver∣ed to the Jews,</HI> S. p. 22.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Author,</HI> to compass his End, cites Mr. <HI>Poole</HI>'s Annotations on the Place; which, tho' they shew that it was not the <HI>Duty</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Disciples</HI> to <HI>fight</HI> for his <HI>Protection,</HI> in his present extraordinary <HI>Situation,</HI> or to promote his <HI>spiritual Kingdom;</HI> yet they confirm the Point I had in View in my Ar∣gument in these Words, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>For was there ever an earthly Prince apprehended and bound, for whom none of his <HI>Servants</HI> would take up <HI>Arms?</HI></Q></P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>S.</HI> desires me to consider, whether Christ's directing us to <HI>pray, That his Will may be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven, does not much more clearly express an Injunction to live in Love and Peace?</HI> I answer, <HI>Defensive War</HI> is consistent with <HI>Love,</HI> as I have before shewn; if not, what be∣comes of the Magistrate? See this Matter opened in the Sermon, p. 31, 32. which it seems our Au∣thor thought it prudent to pass over in Silence;—and is it not the Design of <HI>Defensive War</HI> to procure <HI>Peace</HI> by <HI>Constraint?</HI> Moreover, the <HI>Angels</HI> in <HI>Hea∣ven</HI> are Warriors, as appears from the preceding Sermons!</P>
<P><HI>Religion</HI> is one Thing, and human <HI>Society</HI> is ano∣ther; the former is spiritual, the latter temporal; and therefore spiritual Weapons are suited in Nature and Kind to the one, and temporal to the other: How unreasonable is it therefore to suppose, that be∣cause Christ's <HI>Reign</HI> in the Soul, which is a spiritual Thing, cannot be promoted or maintained by <HI>tem∣poral Means</HI> (directly or immediately) that therefore a <HI>temporal Kingdom</HI> cannot, or should not be pro∣moted, or preserved by them, under God, which are of the same Kind with it, and suited to it! This is just, in other Words, to say, Because that unsuit∣able Means will not answer the End, therefore suit∣able
<PB N="77" REF="006247_0081_102820F369F0D100"/>
will not! According to the aforesaid plain <HI>Con∣cession</HI> of our Lord, the <HI>Subjects</HI> of a <HI>temporal King</HI> may, and ought to fight, in the Defence of their <HI>King,</HI> their <HI>Country,</HI> and <HI>civil Privileges;</HI> and that for this <HI>Reason,</HI> because that <HI>Mean</HI> is suited to the <HI>End.</HI></P>
<P>But to open this Matter a little more, let it be ob∣served, that there are two notable <HI>Societies</HI> among Men, namely, <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Ecclesiastical;</HI> which, tho' they appear mixed and confused, because the same Persons are frequently Members of both, are not∣withstanding distinct and different from each other; they tend to different <HI>Ends</HI> by different <HI>Means,</HI> and have respectively different <HI>Kinds</HI> of <HI>Power.</HI> The <HI>End</HI> of ecclesiastical or religious <HI>Society,</HI> is everlast∣ing <HI>Happiness;</HI> but the End of civil <HI>Society,</HI> is the Peace and Safety of the <HI>State:</HI> These <HI>Ends</HI> being very different, it is no Wonder if the <HI>Means</HI> condu∣cing to them be so likewise. To eternal Happiness none can come, except by an unconstrained and sin∣cere Obedience to the divine Precepts, issuing from Faith and Love, which it is the great Business of <HI>Religion</HI> to promote: But, on the other hand, it is no Matter to the <HI>State,</HI> whether its <HI>Laws</HI> are o∣bey'd <HI>freely</HI> or not; if they be but <HI>obey'd</HI> outwardly, it is enough; this <HI>Obedience</HI> it is their proper <HI>Busi∣ness</HI> to procure, which may be effected by the <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Punishment</HI> and <HI>Death.</HI> In short, the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>State</HI> extends to Mens <HI>Bodies,</HI> but that of the <HI>Church</HI> respects the Soul: The former may, and therefore ought to be compelled to <HI>Obedience,</HI> thro' a Dread of Punishment and Death; but the latter cannot be forced by outward <HI>Violence;</HI> and therefore the <HI>Church</HI> can have no Power over it, nor reclaim Delinquents any other Way, but by <HI>Reproof, Counsel, Entreaty,</HI> and in case of persevering <HI>Obstinacy,</HI> de∣clare them unworthy of their <HI>Communion.</HI> The <HI>Laws</HI>

of civil <HI>Society</HI> respect the <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> of the <HI>Commonwealth;</HI> but the <HI>Canons</HI> of Churches are de∣signed to promote and preserve <HI>Purity</HI> of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> of <HI>Discipline.</HI> From these <HI>Principles</HI> it easily and clearly follows, that the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> is only spiritual, and the <HI>Power</HI> of the <HI>State</HI> only temporal.</P>
<P>Now our Lord Jesus by the Text aforesaid, plainly informs us, that he came not into the World to exercise the <HI>Power</HI> and Dominion of a temporal <HI>Prince; Augustine</HI> upon this Scripture speaketh thus, <Q>Hear ye <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> hear ye earthly <HI>King∣doms,</HI> I hinder not your <HI>Domination</HI> or civil Rule in this World<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Audite ergo Judaei et Gentes—Audite omnia regna terrena; non impedio dominationem vestram in hoc mundo. <HI>Tract. 15. in</HI> Joannem.</NOTE>.</Q> Our Lord did not only by <HI>Words,</HI> but by <HI>Deeds</HI> declare, that he came not to assume a civil <HI>Authority</HI> over temporal Things, par∣ticularly by his <HI>Flight,</HI> least he should be chose a <HI>King</HI> by the <HI>Jews,</HI> and also by his refusing to exer∣cise the <HI>Office</HI> of a civil <HI>Judge</HI> upon their temporal Affairs; when he was entreated to divide an <HI>Inheri∣tance,</HI> he reply'd, <HI>Man, Who made me a Judge or Divider over you?</HI> As if he had said, Go to those to whom that <HI>Power</HI> is committed; hence <HI>Ambrose,</HI> upon this Place, saith, <Q>He justly declin'd intermed∣dling in their temporal Affairs, who only descended to promote heavenly, nor did he think it proper to commence a <HI>Judge</HI> of their <HI>Debates</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Bene <HI>inquit,</HI> terrena declinat, qui propter coelestia tantum de∣scenderet, nec dignatur esse judex litium et arbiter facultatum. <HI>Vid.</HI> Ambrose <HI>in Loc.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>But I hasten to the next <HI>Argument</HI> (or rather <HI>Il∣lustration</HI> of what has been reason'd upon before) which Mr. <HI>S.</HI> takes Notice of, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Corneli∣us,</HI> Acts x. S. <HI>p.</HI> 23.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="006247_0083_102820FA9826BD40"/>Upon which he asks this <HI>Question,</HI> 'Is <HI>Cornelius commended</HI> for his <HI>military Office?</HI></P>
<P>Answer, No! I offered no such Argument, and therefore his Query is impertinent, but seems artful, and calculated to turn my <HI>Argument</HI> out of its pro∣per <HI>Channel.</HI></P>
<P>He observes that <HI>Cornelius</HI> had the <HI>Character</HI> of a <HI>devout Man</HI>—before he was instructed in the <HI>Prin∣ciples</HI> of the <HI>Christian Religion.</HI></P>
<P>Answer, It is true, he had the aforesaid <HI>Charac∣ter,</HI> before he conversed with the Apostle <HI>Peter;</HI> but it is probable he was a <HI>Proselyte</HI> of the <HI>Jewish Religion</HI> (of the Gate) and believed in a <HI>Messias</HI> to come.</P>
<P>Whether he continued in his <HI>Office</HI> or not, is of little Consequence to this Argument, because that is a Matter of <HI>Fact</HI> of an imperfect Creature; but it is concerning <HI>Right</HI> we are to enquire, namely, whe∣ther he cou'd, consistent with <HI>Christianity,</HI> continue in that <HI>Office!</HI> If his <HI>Office</HI> was <HI>sinful,</HI> it was <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>Duty</HI> to instruct him better, and more especially, seeing he came to visit him upon that Design; but not a Word of this, tho' that Apostle was free e∣nough to speak his Mind upon other Occasions.</P>
<P>Farther, Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> signifies his Dislike of my <HI>Interpretation</HI> of these Words of the Apostle <HI>Paul, If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peacea∣bly with all Men,</HI> S. <HI>p.</HI> 23. and gives one himself, which has this uhappy <HI>Defect</HI> attending it, namely, a begging of the Question in <HI>Debate,</HI> as usual with him in this Controversy, <HI>V. p.</HI> 27. for in it are these Words, <Q>Tho' some make <HI>War</HI> upon you, or try to disturb you, yet let <HI>nothing appear on your Side,</HI> but a <HI>meek</HI> and <HI>quiet Spirit;</HI></Q>
<HI>i. e.</HI> No Defence by Action, nothing but absolute <HI>passive Obedience,</HI> and <HI>Non-resistance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="006247_0084_102820FC85AC6098"/>Besides, Mr. <HI>Pool's Gloss,</HI> cited by our <HI>Author,</HI> upon that sacred Sentence of the Apostle, of, <HI>Over∣coming Evil with Good,</HI> respects private Revenge, and is impertinent to the <HI>Point</HI> under <HI>Debate;</HI> there is a sweet Consistency between the Prohibition of <HI>private Revenge,</HI> and the Execution of <HI>publick</HI> by the <HI>Magistrate,</HI> as appears from the <HI>Sermon, p.</HI> 30. where Mr. <HI>Poole</HI>'s <HI>Words,</HI> cited under the <HI>Margin,</HI> prove the <HI>Harmony.</HI></P>
<P>Now it is somethtng strange to me, I confess, that our <HI>Author</HI> having had a View of those Words, which fairly and easily solve the <HI>Difficulty</HI> he starts, shou'd not only pass them over in intire Silence and Neglect, but introduce the Annotations of the same worthy and consistent <HI>Gentleman,</HI> in another Place, in such a Way, as seems to contradict himself, at least in the Eye of the unwary and unskilful <HI>Reader;</HI> and so use him as a <HI>Tool</HI> to promote a <HI>Cause</HI> he op∣pos'd! Whether this <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceeding</HI> is a good <HI>Specimen</HI> of his own Candour, or the Goodness of his <HI>Cause,</HI> I leave to the Determination of others; but for my own Part, I hope the best of his <HI>Design,</HI> and ascribe this odd <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>managing Controver∣sy,</HI> either to Oversight, or the Difficulty of support∣ing the <HI>Cause</HI> he is so zealous for, or both toge∣ther.</P>
<P>To what has been said, allow me to add, that un∣less the Words of the Apostle aforesaid, <HI>If it be possible,</HI> do not suppose that it is sometimes <HI>impossi∣ble</HI> to live peaceably with Men, as the Sermon ob∣serves, the Expression seems to be improper; there is a needless <HI>Supposition,</HI> without a Foundation to support it, altho' the Experience of all Ages, gives a doleful <HI>Suffrage</HI> to the Truth of the <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Fact,</HI> that there is too much <HI>Foundation</HI> for such a Supposition.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="006247_0085_1027DB5439E9AF00"/>The next Particular that Mr. <HI>S.</HI> censures, is the Argument from <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 32,—34. mentioned S. <HI>p.</HI> 23, 24. the Substance of which is, that the Apos∣tle gives an honourable <HI>Encomium</HI> of the <HI>Prowess</HI> and <HI>Exploits</HI> of divers ancient <HI>Heroes,</HI> comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> by a <HI>Gospel-Faith,</HI> without the least Hint of an Alte∣ration in <HI>Gospel-Times;</HI> hence it is concluded to be improbable, that he himself shou'd be of a contrary <HI>Sentiment,</HI> especially considering, that he virtually and consequentially signified his <HI>Approbation</HI> of <HI>War</HI> by his <HI>Practice</HI> in not rejecting the <HI>Protection</HI> of an <HI>armed Force.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> answers in the following Mapper, <HI>V. p.</HI> 28, 29. <Q>But where is the Difficulty? Does not the Apostle in the same Chapter commend the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Abram</HI> in leaving his own Country, and <HI>offering</HI> up his <HI>only Son Isaac</HI> at the <HI>Command of God?</HI> Now will, or can this be construed to infer, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at because <HI>Abram</HI> did these Things at the divine Command, and the Apostle don't give the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast Hint of any Alteration in Gospel Times, in the Respect, that therefore a Christian may f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow that Example without such Command? And yet this Consequence is as fair, as to infer, that be∣cause <HI>Gideon, &amp;c.</HI> did go to War at the Com∣mand of God—that therefore Christians may fol∣low their Example without such <HI>Command.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>The Reader will not find that <HI>Paul</HI> did so much as make <HI>any Application</HI> for the <HI>Protection</HI> of an <HI>armed Force,</HI> tho' he knew there was a <HI>Consp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cy</HI> form'd for the taking away his <HI>Life;</HI> he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>the necessary Steps</HI> to <HI>inform</HI> the <HI>Chief Capt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> in whose Custody he was) of <HI>that Design.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Our Author adds, <Q>That <HI>Paul</HI> being a <HI>Prisoner,</HI> it would not be reasonable or prudent for him, supposing his Judgment had been clear again<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Lawfulness of War for Christians, to refuse being

<HI>conducted</HI> by the <HI>Soldiers,</HI> whither their <HI>Superior</HI> had ordered them to take him.</Q></P>
<P>To which I <HI>reply,</HI> that there are the following <HI>Errata</HI> in the aforesaid <HI>Answer,</HI> which render it inconclusive, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Our <HI>Author</HI> passes over in deep <HI>Silence,</HI> the aforesaid <HI>Worthies</HI> compassing their <HI>Victories</HI> by a <HI>Gospel Faith,</HI> upon which I laid the greatest <HI>Stress</HI> of the Argument, and from it reason'd thus, <Q>Now can it be that that War shou'd be agreeable to, and encourag'd by <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Messias,</HI> that grand <HI>Peculiar,</HI> and <HI>Foundation</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and yet be contrary to it?</Q> This <HI>Omission</HI> of our <HI>Author,</HI> seems to be more <HI>cautious</HI> than <HI>candid.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He represents <HI>Defensive War,</HI> against the un∣just <HI>Encroachments</HI> of an <HI>Enemy,</HI> and a <HI>Parent</HI>'s <HI>killing</HI> an <HI>only Child,</HI> when done without immediate <HI>Revelation</HI> or <HI>Command,</HI> as of a <HI>parallel Nature,</HI> which is shocking indeed! Is <HI>Defensive War</HI> then as contrary to the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> and the <HI>moral Law,</HI> as a <HI>Parent</HI>'s <HI>killing</HI> of an only <HI>Child,</HI> when done without immediate Command and Revelation? If the Case be so, then seeing the far greater Part of the World are for <HI>Defensive War,</HI> and pretend to no immediate <HI>Revelation,</HI> they are of Consequence look'd upon by our <HI>Author,</HI> as a Set of <HI>heinous</HI> MURDERERS, which is no great <HI>Expression</HI> of Cha∣rity!</P>
<P>Was not God's <HI>Command</HI> to <HI>Abraham</HI> very ex∣traordinary, and only for Trial, without <HI>Design</HI> of its being executed, and was this the Case of <HI>A∣bram</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> in their Wars? The Conse∣quence is therefore unjust, of the Necessity of an immediate Command, or new <HI>Revelation,</HI> for what is in itself <HI>morally good.</HI> If there must be a new <HI>Re∣velation</HI> for every <HI>Battle,</HI> there must be the same al∣so by a Parity of <HI>Reason,</HI> every Time before the

<HI>Magistrate kills</HI> a <HI>Criminal,</HI> for the <HI>Object</HI> of his <HI>Faith</HI> must be <HI>Deus loquens;</HI> and what then must become of all <HI>publick Justice</HI> and <HI>Government?</HI> Must every Magistrate be inspir'd?</P>
<P N="3">3. Our <HI>Author</HI> shews some <HI>Art</HI> in separating what I said of <HI>Paul</HI>'s not refusing the <HI>Protection</HI> of an <HI>armed Force,</HI> from the preceding Argument, which it was join'd with in the same Paragraph, in order to support it; but in the mean Time, he is so unhappy as to contradict himself; for while he de∣clares that <HI>Paul</HI> did not so much as make ANY AP∣PLICATION for the <HI>Protection</HI> or an ARMED FORCE; yet he acknowledges, that he took the NECESSARY STEPS TO INFORM THE CHIEF CAP∣TAIN OF THAT DESIGN, not doubting but he would have so much JUSTICE, as to prevent such a PRIVATE MURDER. But how as a <HI>Captain,</HI> but by Force? Our Author here acknowledges all that I intended by my Argument; I would there∣forefore proceed to new <HI>Matter.</HI></P>
<P>And that which comes first to be considered, is our <HI>Author's Remarks</HI> upon what I have said upon <HI>James</HI> iv. 1. <HI>S. p.</HI> 25. <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>That the Apostle <HI>James</HI> does not say, that <HI>War</HI> is ever unjust and sinful upon both Sides, or unnecessary in Man's fallen State, but that the original Cause of War is Evil, because it is always unjust upon one Side!</Q></P>
<P>Upon which Mr. <HI>S.</HI> proposes the following <HI>Query,</HI> namely, <Q>Can a <HI>true Christian</HI> then, who hath known <HI>the Ax laid to the Root of the Tree, i. e.</HI> the Spirit of God giving him Victory over Lust, join with, countenance, or encourage that which hath <HI>Lust</HI> for its Original?</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Not with <HI>Offensive War,</HI> which doubtless rises from that fatal Source, No! by no Means! but ought to oppose it in <HI>Words</HI> and <HI>Works;</HI> not
<PB N="84" REF="006247_0088_1028210E65ED9458"/>
only with the <HI>Tongue</HI> and <HI>Pen,</HI> but even with the <HI>Sword,</HI> when Necessity requires.</P>
<P>I join with the <HI>Gentleman</HI> my <HI>Opponent</HI> with all my Heart, in his just Resentment against <HI>Offensive War,</HI> and cou'd wish he might have Freedom, to carry it to a higher Pitch, and prove it by <HI>Action,</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the late excellent ASSOCIATION, for the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ppression</HI> of that <HI>awful Evil,</HI> which Words and Writings fail to express the <HI>Perverseness of!</HI></P>
<P>But I think it is a Pity that our Author, for wars of distinguishing <HI>Offensive</HI> from <HI>Defensive War,</HI> in the preceding Paragraph, has unhappily condem∣ned the <HI>Innocent</HI> with the <HI>Guilty!</HI> for he represents all <HI>War</HI> in the Complex as <HI>Darkness,</HI> and the <HI>Power</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which I humbly conceive our <HI>Author</HI> will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be able to prove, till he can prove two Con∣tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to be the same, which is impossible in the <HI>Nature</HI> of Things! And as a Consequence of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Confusion of <HI>Sentiment,</HI> he is exceeding <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>table</HI> in his Opinion of all the World, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> excepted (which they may be compara∣ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>all'd) who are for absolute <HI>Passive-Obedience</HI> and <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-Resistance;</HI> all the rest besides them, our Au∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges to be

this is lamentable! and doesn't shew such a Degree of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or <HI>Love</HI> as could be wish'd, tho' I trust he means well!</P>
<P>Give me leave to add to what has been said, that the aforesaid Place of Scripture, plainly and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the <HI>Original</HI> of <HI>Offensive War,</HI> which doubtl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss is the <HI>ungovernable Lusts</HI> of wicked Men; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Ambition</HI> and <HI>Avarice,</HI> as the Apostle ex∣plains is the following Verse, these make Men dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> with their own Possessions, and dispose th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n unjustly to invade others, which is quite fo∣reig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the <HI>Point</HI> in <HI>Dispute;</HI> that is, the <HI>Defence</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="006247_0089_1028210FE9CB10F0"/>
of our <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> from the aforesaid <HI>un∣just Violence,</HI> and differs as much from the other, as <HI>Justice</HI> from <HI>Injustice,</HI> and therefore I see not how the <HI>Opposers</HI> of <HI>Defensive War,</HI> will ever be a∣ble fairly to carry their Point, until they solidly prove, that <HI>Justice,</HI> and <HI>regular Self-love,</HI> are evil and wicked; which, if I am not much mistaken, is a <HI>Herculian Labour!</HI></P>
<P>The aforesaid Passage of the <HI>Apostle James,</HI> is so far from being a new <HI>Revelation,</HI> materially, that it is no other than what divers judicious <HI>Pagans</HI> dis∣cover'd by the <HI>Dint</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI>'s <HI>Light. E. G.</HI></P>

<PB N="86" REF="006247_0090_10282113B939F6A0"/>
is unreasonable, and contrary to Matter of Fact, and why is it not to be deemed so in the other Case?</P>
<P>In the next Place, our <HI>Author</HI> endeavours to e∣nervate my Answer, to an Objection that might be formed, from these Words of the <HI>Apostle,</HI> 2 Cor. X. 4. <HI>That the Weapons of our Warfare are not car∣nal,</HI> S. p. 25, 26.</P>
<P>Which our <HI>Author,</HI> in his <HI>Reply, V. p.</HI> 30. sig∣nifies, if it be interpreted to mean no more than what I have said in the Sermon (to watch, for the sake of <HI>Brevity,,</HI> I refer the <HI>Reader,</HI> is not among Justice to the <HI>Text,</HI> but rather charging a natural Absurdity! because the Apostle in t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing Verse had told them, <HI>For tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Flesh, we do not war after the Flesh;</HI> from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> infers, that they did not use <HI>carnal Weapons</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all.</P>
<P>I answer, the Consequence is unfair, and not bot∣tomed on the Words he cites. The Apostle doesn't say that they didn't <HI>war in the Flesh,</HI> but only, that they <HI>didn't war after the Flesh;</HI> i. e. for <HI>fleshly</HI> or wicked <HI>Ends,</HI> from <HI>fleshly</HI> or wicked <HI>Principles,</HI> and in a <HI>fleshly</HI> or wicked <HI>Way,</HI> as the Word <HI>Flesh</HI> is sometimes taken in a good Sense in Scripture; and hence <HI>all Flesh is said to be Grass;</HI> so sometimes in a bad; and thus he that is said <HI>to be born of the Flesh, is Flesh.</HI> Mr. <HI>Poole</HI> in his Annotations upon the Place, favours the Sense I have given; his Words are these; <Q>Tho' our Souls are in a State of Union to our <HI>Bodies,</HI> yet we war not after the Flesh, neither as fleshly Men, or in a fleshly Man∣ner, nor yet for fleshly <HI>Ends;</HI> the Men of the World war for their Honour and Glory, or for Revenge and Satisfaction of their Lusts, or for the Enlargement of their Territories and Dominions; but we do not thus?,</Q> No! that is a wicked, <HI>offen∣sive War,</HI> which our Author does well to oppose. Does the aforesaid Text speak any thing against a
<PB N="87" REF="006247_0091_102821154A148160"/>
lawful War? No! only directs us how to conduct all Actions to the divine Acceptance; and therefore our Author's Charge of Absurdity wants a Founda∣tion! But not perceiving this himself,</P>
<P>Our Author proceeds to confute a Paragraph in the Sermon, p. 25, 26. which signifies, that it is presumptuous to expect an <HI>End</HI> without the Use of <HI>Means</HI> suited to it; <Q>To expect a <HI>Crop</HI> by the <HI>Dint</HI> of our <HI>Supplications,</HI> without <HI>plowing;</HI> or <HI>De∣fence</HI> from unreasonable Men, without using pro∣per <HI>Means</HI> for <HI>Defence,</HI> are equally unreasonable.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>S.</HI> offers several Things to overset the afore∣said Paragraph, the Force of which I shall as briefly as possible examine. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. He observes, <HI>V.</HI> p. 31. <Q>That the <HI>Means</HI> which the <HI>Gospel</HI> allows for maintaining and keeping of <HI>Peace,</HI> are, in the first and chiefest Place, the Practice of Christian <HI>Virtues.</HI></Q> Very true, they are excellent in Nature and Tendency, and it were to be wished that they prevailed more in the <HI>World</HI> than they do; <HI>offensive War</HI> is not like to come from that Quarter, where they have the A∣scendant!</P>
<P>But does our <HI>Author</HI> think, that <HI>when a Man's Ways please the Lord,</HI> that he will <HI>always</HI> make his <HI>Enemies</HI> to be at peace with him? If so, then what shall we think of <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles?</HI> And what of these Sayings of <HI>Jesus? That his Disciples must bear his Cross, and be hated of all Men for his Name's sake, and that the World shall hate them, be∣cause they are not of it.</HI></P>
<P>As to any good Understanding that has subsisted between this <HI>Province</HI> and any <HI>Pagan</HI> Nations, it is to be acknowledged with all Thankfulness, as a great and undeserved <HI>Mercy of God!</HI> yet I cannot think that it is any certain <HI>Argument</HI> of the superior <HI>Piety</HI> of the first <HI>Planters</HI> (tho' I have no Inclination or
<PB N="88" REF="006247_0092_1028211B5D6129F8"/>
Intention to reflect upon them, being unacquainted with their <HI>Character</HI>) and my Reason is this, be∣cause the wise Man observes, <HI>That we cannot know either Love or Hatred, by all that is before us; and there is one Event to the Righteous, and to the Wick∣ed.</HI></P>
<P>This is a State of <HI>Trial,</HI> and not of <HI>Rewards;</HI> and hence it is that <HI>Events</HI> are promiscuous, and be∣ing such, there can be no certain Conclusion drawn rationally from them, concerning the States of Men.</P>
<P>But supposing the superior <HI>Piety</HI> of the first <HI>Settlers</HI> of this <HI>Province,</HI> and their good <HI>Understanding</HI> and <HI>Harmony</HI> with <HI>numerous warlike Nations;</HI> yet nei∣ther of these Particulars singly, nor both complexly, will prove that they were right in all their reli∣gious <HI>Sentiments,</HI> because a gracious God, when the Intention is sincere, may, and does sometimes overlook and forgive <HI>Mistakes</HI> in <HI>Principle,</HI> about Things not essential to <HI>Religion,</HI> as well as <HI>Failures</HI> in <HI>Practice,</HI> naturally consequent thereupon, and vouchsafes his favourable <HI>Smiles,</HI> notwithstanding; which is indeed a great Argument of his <HI>Goodness</HI> and Condescension, and of the <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of his <HI>Grace,</HI> but no certain <HI>Evidence</HI> of the Justness of the <HI>Sentiments,</HI> or <HI>Regularity</HI> in the Practices of Men of any Denomination in this or that Instance.</P>
<P>In the mean time, I am credibly informed, that the good Understanding which this Province has had, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> has been only with the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> with which the other <HI>American</HI> Colonies have had Peace likewise; so that there is nothing extraordina∣ry in the Matter.</P>
<P>Not to say that the aforesaid good Understanding has been doubtless maintained by the Use of out∣ward Means, such as <HI>Treaties,</HI> and repeated Dona∣tions: But now I am told that the <HI>State</HI> of our Af∣fairs with some of the <HI>Indian Tribes</HI> is <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>du∣bious,</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="006247_0093_10282122A95EA320"/>
which should alarm the Inhabitants of this Province, to prepare for their <HI>Defence</HI> against such <HI>savage Enemies,</HI> whose <HI>Barbarities</HI> in <HI>War</HI> are too shocking to relate!</P>
<P>But tho' the Practice of <HI>Humility, Meekness, Benefi∣cence,</HI> &amp;c. are very good to continue <HI>Peace</HI> where it is; what shall be done to procure it where it is lost, if <HI>Defensive War</HI> be denied? Must we tamely deliver up our <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Properties</HI> to the <HI>Lusts</HI> of Men, without Controul? No! our <HI>Author</HI> seems to acknowledge the contrary, by saying,</P>
<P N="2">2. <Q>And the Trust reposed in the <HI>civil Power,</HI> for the <HI>Punishment</HI> of <HI>Evil-doers,</HI> &amp;c. faithfully discharged, we should be so blessed and favoured with the peculiar Care of <HI>Heaven,</HI> that no violent Men should be permitted to make a Prey of us;</Q> This is sound Doctrine indeed; but pray how can the <HI>Trust</HI> reposed in the <HI>civil Power</HI> be <HI>faithfully dis∣charged,</HI> without preparing for <HI>Defence</HI> against an <HI>Enemy,</HI> and actually wielding the <HI>Sword</HI> for that Purpose, when there is Occasion? Without these, to talk of the <HI>civil Power's discharging its Trust faith∣fully,</HI> is, in my Opinion, unintelligible <HI>Jargon</HI> and <HI>Gibberish;</HI> and if these Things be allowed, our Au∣thor gives up his Cause. But,</P>
<P N="3">3. Our Author thinks, that to expect a <HI>Crop</HI> by the <HI>Dint</HI> of our <HI>Supplications,</HI> and to expect <HI>Pro∣tection</HI> on account of our <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Prayers,</HI> are not similar Cases. Why so? 1. Because that the <HI>Means</HI> to procure a <HI>Crop,</HI> are necessary, <HI>innocent</HI> and <HI>use∣ful</HI> to the <HI>Creation,</HI> but <HI>War</HI> is ruinous and destruc∣tive to it. <HI>Answer,</HI> Very true; <HI>offensive War</HI> is so; and therefore <HI>defensive</HI> being its contrary, is excellent and necessary to preserve the <HI>Creation</HI> from <HI>Ruin!</HI></P>

they prove it by <HI>miraculous Works;</HI> and when this supposed <HI>Revelation</HI> enjoins any Thing in itself unreasonable, and opposes any <HI>moral Duty,</HI> which I think I have proved <HI>Self-defence</HI> to be, we have good Ground to believe it is a <HI>Mistake;</HI> for the Almigh∣ty is consistent with himself in all his <HI>Precepts:</HI> And indeed such a dangerous <HI>Mistake</HI> should warn, and invite us to keep close to the <HI>Law</HI> and the <HI>Testimo∣ny,</HI> to <HI>the surer Word of Prophecy,</HI> as well as to va∣lue highly, and use humbly, in Subordination there∣to, that <HI>Reason</HI> which <HI>God</HI> hath graciously given us, lest we fall into many more.</P>
<P>But our <HI>Author</HI> proceeds to enquire, <HI>V. p.</HI> 33. <Q>Is it not more consistent with the <HI>Duty</HI> of a <HI>Mini∣ster</HI> of the Meek, Self-denying <HI>Jesus,</HI> to recommend Piety and Prayers, as the only acceptable <HI>Means</HI> ne∣cessary to obtain the Protection of <HI>Heaven?</HI></Q></P>
<P>I answer in the Negative, No! a Minister of <HI>Je∣sus</HI> should tell the Truth, and <HI>deliver the whole Coun∣cil of God.</HI> A <HI>Watchman, when he sees the Sword coming upon a Land, should blow the Trumpet, and warn the People, otherwise their Blood will be requi∣red at his Hand!</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>S.</HI> proceeds next to consider what I have said upon the Prophecy of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> ii. 4. upon which he spends several Pages, <HI>V.</HI> 33, 34, 35, 36, 37. He censures my Interpretation of the Prophecy, and thinks it was designed to signify an utter Exclusion of all <HI>War</HI> of every Kind; and therefore concludes it sinful for pious People to be concerned in <HI>War</HI> at all; this I take to be the Substance of what he has said. I have in the Sermon asserted, that the <HI>Gospel</HI> inclines all that receive it in Truth, <HI>to live as much as is possible in Peace with all Men:</HI> That it is at∣tended with an <HI>internal Peace,</HI> and that probably there will be a <HI>Time,</HI> before the End of the World, when the Power of <HI>Religion</HI> shall prevail more ge∣nerally
<PB N="91" REF="006247_0095_10282127C181FC80"/>
than at present, and outward Peace flourish, as the Consequent of it. <HI>See S. p.</HI> 26, 27.</P>
<P>The Difference then between us lies in this single Point, of the Lawfulness of using <HI>Defensive War,</HI> till that Time comes when there will be no Occasion for it; I assert this, and he denies it; let me there∣fore examine the Grounds of his <HI>Negative.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="1">1. <Q>The <HI>Cause,</HI> saith our Author, is the judging of <HI>Christ</HI> internally in Individuals, and the <HI>Effect,</HI> that wherever this judging is experienced, there is such a Cessation from all War, <HI>A good Tree bring∣eth not forth corrupt Fruit,</HI> Luke vi. 43. But <HI>War</HI> is a corrupt Fruit, because it hath Lust for its Original.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Very true, <HI>Offensive War</HI> is so; and there∣fore those that are pious will not bring forth such Fruit; as our Author well observes; No! but op∣pose it; and this, methinks, should be in <HI>Works,</HI> as well as in <HI>Words.</HI> I am so far from a Desire of les∣sening our Author's <HI>Opposition</HI> to <HI>sinful War,</HI> name∣ly, <HI>Offensive,</HI> that I heartily wish it was much <HI>strong∣er,</HI> and that he might get such Light, as to concur with others in Preparation to crush that <HI>Cockatrice,</HI> under God, by main <HI>Force,</HI> if milder Measures will not do, which we should be glad they would, and so prevent the Necessity of <HI>shedding human Blood;</HI> this is a Disposition truly sublime, as he justly ob∣serves!</P>
<P N="2">2. Our <HI>Author</HI> offers the <HI>Jewish Objection</HI> against my <HI>Opinion, V. p.</HI> 35. which he is pleased to intro∣duce with an Air of <HI>Disdain;</HI> how will our <HI>mighty Pleader</HI> for <HI>War</HI> answer this Objection? Mr. <HI>S.</HI> has to Appearance used slighting <HI>Terms</HI> in several Parts of his Performance, this <HI>Sermon-writer,</HI> &amp;c. not considering, perhaps, that he is guilty likewise of that <HI>awful Crime</HI> as well as me, since he has enter'd into an <HI>Offensive War</HI> against me; and in this Place, by
<PB N="92" REF="006247_0096_10282129A6CC53C8"/>
the Figure <HI>Antiphrasis,</HI> he represents me as very weak!</P>
<P>Well, I own the <HI>Justice</HI> of his <HI>Charge,</HI> and there∣fore any <HI>Defects</HI> that may attend this <HI>Essay,</HI> are to be ascribed thereto; and if there be any thing of a different <HI>Kind,</HI> it is to be ascribed to the Kindness of a gracious <HI>God,</HI> and the goodness of my <HI>Cause,</HI> that have helped a <HI>weak Instrument!</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time, as to the <HI>Jewish Objection,</HI> so far as I can see, his Opinion does not in the least weaken it, for as much as the Prophecy respects a <HI>national Peace,</HI> which does not obtain; and therefore what becomes of the <HI>Truth</HI> of the <HI>Prophecy,</HI> if it certainly intends an external as well as internal Peace, as an immediate Consequent of the <HI>Messiah</HI>'s coming?</P>
<P N="3">3. Our <HI>Author</HI> finds Fault, <HI>V. p.</HI> 35. with my saying that the <HI>Gospel</HI> subdues Mens Corruptions in a <HI>Measure;</HI> he would have had me to have omitted these Words, in a <HI>Measure;</HI> but I assure him, that I don't know how to leave them out, nor does he do so, as to himself, in his <HI>Preface.</HI></P>
<P><Q>For Humility and Meekness, saith he, are quite opposite to <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Fighting,</HI> which pro∣ceed from Pride and Covetousness.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Very just, and therefore we ought to sup∣press in others, that Monster, <HI>Offensive War;</HI> on∣ly our <HI>Author,</HI> as I conceive, doesn't oppose e∣nough in <HI>Degree;</HI> there seems to be his great <HI>De∣fect.</HI>'</P>
<P>But our <HI>Author</HI> is pleased to query, Does not the Intimation, that the <HI>Gospel received in the Love of it,</HI> only in a <HI>Measure</HI> subdues Mens Corruptions, <HI>imply a Deficiency in the Power?</HI> And can it be consistent with our Lord's Doctrine, <HI>Except a Man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> To the former Question, No! I'll make bold to take himself for an Instance. In his <HI>Pre∣face</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="006247_0097_1028212D44C79E18"/>
he acknowledges <HI>that he has not yet attained, nor is already perfect:</HI> I am apt to think our Author speaks the <HI>Truth</HI> here, and that his present <HI>Perfor∣mance</HI> is a Proof thereof. Now, one of these two Things follows from these two Passages of our <HI>Au∣thor;</HI> either that he has not received the <HI>Gospel</HI> in the <HI>Love</HI> of it; or that his Imperfection argues no Deficiency of Power in <HI>God</HI> or his <HI>Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>No! the Wisdom of <HI>God</HI> appears in suffering our present State to be attended with <HI>Defects;</HI> hereby constant Occasion is given for Self-abasement, prizing of <HI>Christ,</HI> and continual <HI>Dependence</HI> upon him, as well as longing for that Time and Place, when and where <HI>that</HI> WHICH IS PERFECT SHALL COME, <HI>and that which is in Part, shall be done away.</HI></P>
<P>Bringing in <HI>Poole</HI>'s Annotations, to patronize the Doctrine of <HI>Perfection,</HI> is no Argument that our Author has attain'd it himself; for it is an <HI>Attempt</HI> to make him speak contrary to his real <HI>Sentiments</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>See his Annotations upon 1 <HI>John</HI> xviii. <HI>If we say that we have no Sin, we deceive ourselves, and the Truth is not in us.</HI>
<Q>If we either profess it as a Principle, or think in our Minds, or do not bear in our Hearts, a penitential remorseful Sense, correspondent to the contrary Apprehension—<HI>We deceive ourselves, i. e.</HI> The Frame and <HI>System</HI> of Gospel <HI>Doctrine</HI> (as 2 <HI>John</HI> i. 2.4) cannot be duly entertain'd, lies not evenly and agreeably with itself in our Minds, or hath no Place with Effect in us, as <HI>John</HI> viii. 37.' He speaks the same Thing for Substance in his <HI>Synopsis,</HI> and declares, '<HI>That none live without daily and frequent Sins;</HI>' and observes, 'That <HI>Augus∣tine, Hierom, Ambrose,</HI> and the Council of <HI>Mileu,</HI> have as∣serted the same against PELAGIUS;</Q> and interprets that other Scripture, 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 9. That <HI>Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him: And he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</HI> In this Manner. <Q>A regenerate Man, and a Child of God, are all one; he cannot do an Act of known gross Sin deliberately, easily, remorselesly, mali∣ciously, as <HI>Cain, V.</HI> 12. out of a Hatred of Goodness; <HI>For his Seed remaineth in him; i. e.</HI> the Principles of enliv'ned holy Truth, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 23. <HI>James</HI> i. 8.—It belongs to his Temper and Inclination, received in Regeneration, to abhor from the grosser Acts, much more from a Course of Sin.</Q> In his <HI>Sy∣nopsis</HI> he speaks largely and nobly to the same Effect, and cites <HI>Tertullian Austin</HI> and <HI>Hierom,</HI> as of the same Sentiment. The Words of <HI>Tertullian</HI> are these, <Q><HI>Peccare enim graviter potest, qui aliquando f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lius Dei fuerit.</HI> He may sin grievously, who has been some Time a Child of God!</Q></P>

The <HI>New-Birth</HI> no doubt implies a real and univer∣sal <HI>Change</HI> of all the <HI>Powers</HI> of the <HI>Soul,</HI> whereby the general and free <HI>Byas</HI> of it is turn'd towards <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Dominion</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> broken, but not in a per∣fect Degree; for if so, Mr. <HI>S.</HI> by his own Ac∣knowledgment, aforesaid, is unacquainted with it.</P>
<P>In <HI>V. p.</HI> 37, 38. our <HI>Author</HI> proposes this Que∣ry, <Q>When the <HI>Flame</HI> of an unjust <HI>War</HI> broke out a∣gainst the Followers of Christ, did they resist? did they defend themselves? If not, how will the Sermon's Conclusion, <HI>p,</HI> 24. stand good? If the Offensive be unjust, the Defensive must of Conse∣quence be just.</Q></P>
<P>I answer, That our <HI>Author</HI> changes the <HI>State</HI> of the <HI>Question,</HI> in the aforesaid Particular; there is a wide Difference between <HI>private Persons</HI> suffering <HI>Perse∣cution</HI> upon a <HI>religious Account,</HI> with Meekness, which is their <HI>Duty,</HI> and a <HI>Nation</HI>'s suffering tame∣ly an Enemy to <HI>rob</HI> them of their <HI>Goods</HI> and <HI>Lives</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="006247_0099_1028213761DC1358"/>
upon a <HI>civil,</HI> which is their <HI>Sin!</HI> This <HI>Fallacy</HI> being removed, the <HI>Sermon</HI>'s <HI>Conclusion</HI> stands good.</P>
<P>But to return from this <HI>Digression,</HI> which I have been led into by Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> I shall beg Leave to offer somewhat more upon the <HI>Prophecy</HI> aforesaid, <HI>Isa.</HI> ii. 4. Supposing that the <HI>Design</HI> thereof was outward <HI>Peace,</HI> the Doctrine of <HI>Defensive War,</HI> when Necessity requires, does not oppose it, for this only allows the <HI>Liberty</HI> of using <HI>Force,</HI> in Cases of Extremity, after all mild Measures are used, and prove ineffectual; and in the mean Time incul∣cates, a <HI>peaceable loving Temper</HI> of <HI>Mind</HI> towards others; now how can that hinder <HI>Peace,</HI> which in∣culcates it upon the Good, and constrains the Bad to it, by Arguments of <HI>Fear?</HI> or, in other Words, how can that hinder <HI>Peace,</HI> which promotes it?</P>
<P>Those that are truly pious, are so disposed to <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> that they do not give Cause for <HI>War,</HI> by their Conduct; No! it is the Wicked and Impenitent who <HI>oppress,</HI> and thereby give <HI>Cause</HI> for <HI>Defensive War.</HI></P>
<P>Hence it appears, that in order to promote a ge∣neral <HI>Peace,</HI> there is no Need of Mens quitting the <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>Defensive War;</HI> no, but only of a <HI>Change</HI> of the <HI>Hearts</HI> and <HI>Lives</HI> of <HI>wicked Men;</HI> for it is from them, that that <HI>Monster</HI> of <HI>Offensive War</HI> proceeds!</P>
<P>If a <HI>peaceable Disposition</HI> cannot consist with the Doctrine of <HI>Defensive War,</HI> then it will follow, that those <HI>pious People</HI> before the <HI>Law,</HI> and under the <HI>Law,</HI> that held it, which they all did, so far as we know, were not of a peaceable Disposition; but the latter is false, and therefore the former. Was not <HI>Abram</HI> of a <HI>peaceable Disposition,</HI> and <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Joshua,</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> and a Multitude of others, of whose <HI>Piety</HI> we have the infallible Testimony of <HI>God</HI> himself, <HI>Heb.</HI> xi. 13. King <HI>David,</HI> that gallant
<PB N="96" REF="006247_0100_10282139304FDBE0"/>
<HI>Hero,</HI> had such strong Desires after <HI>Peace,</HI> and yet cou'd not obtain it, that he takes up a Lamentation on that Occasion, and says, <HI>Wo is me that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar. My Soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth Peace. I am for Peace; but when I speak, they are for War!</HI></P>
<P>Can any Now-a-days, who are for the Doctrine of <HI>passive Obedience,</HI> and absolute <HI>Non-resistance,</HI> pretend to exceed <HI>Abram</HI> in <HI>Faith, Moses</HI> in <HI>Meek∣ness, Joshua</HI> in <HI>Integrity,</HI> and <HI>David</HI> in holy <HI>Zeal</HI> and Desires after <HI>Peace?</HI></P>
<P>Pray are not <HI>Magistrates</HI> to be peaceable in Dis∣position as well as others under the <HI>Gospel?</HI> and yet must they not use <HI>Force</HI> and shed <HI>Blood</HI> in some Ca∣ses? Hence I query, Can these Things consist in the <HI>Magistrate,</HI> yea or not? I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yea, then I ask, why not in others? If nay, then why is such a wick∣ed <HI>Office</HI> appointed, in which a Man cannot be of a <HI>peaceable Disposition,</HI> and consequently cannot be <HI>pious?</HI> For how can there be any true <HI>Piety,</HI> with∣out such a <HI>Temper</HI> of <HI>Mind?</HI> If there can, let it be shewn; if not, shou'dn't every one that desires the <HI>Salvation</HI> of his <HI>Soul,</HI> upon this <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> shun the <HI>Magistracy,</HI> as he wou'd the <HI>Damnation</HI> of <HI>Hell?</HI></P>
<P>It is true, if Goodness in Perfection was univer∣sally obtain'd, there wou'd be no Need of <HI>Defensive War,</HI> nor of the <HI>civil Law</HI> neither; will it therefore follow, that before that Time comes, we may reasonably reject all Use of the <HI>Law,</HI> and tamely suffer unrea∣sonable Men, to ruin our <HI>Credit,</HI> abuse our <HI>Bodies;</HI> and rob us of our <HI>Estates,</HI> without applying to the <HI>Magistrate</HI> for <HI>Protection,</HI> Reparation of important <HI>Wrongs,</HI> and the Punishment of heinous <HI>Delin∣quents?</HI> If so, then what signifies the <HI>Magistracy?</HI> Is it not a meer <HI>Farce?</HI> And if so, how will the A∣postle's

<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> next proceeds, <HI>V. p.</HI> 38, 39. to re∣fute my Explication of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Words, about <HI>not resisting Evil, Mat.</HI> v. 44. the Substance of which he represents to be this, <Q>That we shou'd rather endure smaller and tolerable Injuries with Patience, than contend or go to Law for Satisfaction—That we should not indulge <HI>private Revenge, &amp;c.</HI> That we should wish well to our Enemies, and treat them with Humanity and Kindness when in Want and Distress; and be ready to forgive the Injuries they have committed against us, when they repent over them—and that we shou'dn't exercise Severi∣ty toward them, till the Case comes to Extremity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> I desire the Reader to see the Matter stated in my own Words, more at large, in the Sermon, from <HI>p.</HI> 23. to <HI>p.</HI> 32.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> dislikes the aforesaid <HI>Explication,</HI> and offers several Objections against it, which I shall now endeavour to examine; but before I enter upon this, I would have the <HI>Reader</HI> carefully to <HI>remark,</HI> that he has in his <HI>Reply,</HI> entirely pass'd over what GRO∣TIUS, and POOLE, and MYSELF <HI>have said to re∣move
<PB N="98" REF="006247_0102_10282145CCD02AA8"/>
the</HI> DIFFICULTY that seems to arise from the a∣foresaid Text, in the forecited Pages of the <HI>Sermon,</HI> viz. 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. which is very unfair Dealing, and a Sign of the Indefensibleness of his <HI>Cause.</HI> But I proceed to his Objections, the 1st of which is this, <HI>V. p.</HI> 38. <Q><HI>It is probable our Author tho't he shou'd make his Objection too strong, if he had given the Reasons which the Text u∣ses, for enforcing Obedience to these Doctrines,</HI> That ye may be the Children of your Father in Hea∣ven, for he maketh his Sun to rise on the Evil, and on the Good, and sendeth Rain on the Just, and on the Unjust—Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Fa∣ther which is in Heaven is perfect.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> It is so far from what our <HI>Author</HI> has un∣charitably imagined, that the Addition thereof strengthens my Argument, for our heavenly Father executes Justice upon the Impenitent, as well as vouchsafes Mercy upon the Penitent, and shou'dn't we endeavour to imitate him in all his moral <HI>Excel∣lencies?</HI> Or must we, to obtain <HI>Gospel-perfection,</HI> go beyond <HI>God</HI> himself, or be <HI>unlike him?</HI> A dreadful <HI>Perfection</HI> this indeed! Pray isn't <HI>Justice</HI> one of God's <HI>moral Excellencies?</HI> And when we are com∣manded to be <HI>perfect</HI> as he is, doesn't it necessarily imply, our being like him in that as well as others? Or does this <HI>Gospel-perfection</HI> contain one Excellency only, namely, <HI>Mercy?</HI> Or does it exclude any one? Then it is a poor, <HI>partial, imperfect Perfection</HI> indeed! unworthy of the honourable Name of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and contrary to right <HI>Reason!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. <Q>A small <HI>Injury</HI> is attended with a De∣gree of <HI>Injustice,</HI> and the enduring rather than re∣turning it, shews in some Degree a Christian <HI>Dis∣position</HI>—Now consider that Consequence with Re∣spect to greater; the enduring of them, rather than returning <HI>Evil</HI> for Evil, doth certainly shew

<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I deny the Consequence, unless the <HI>Injury</HI> come upon us for the Cause of <HI>Religion;</HI> there is a <HI>Measure</HI> to be observed in these Things<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Est modus in rebus, sunt certi denique fines.</NOTE>; the Place of <HI>Virtue</HI> is the <HI>Middle</HI> between two Extreams<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Virtus in mediocritate posita, Aristot. medio tutissimus ibis.</NOTE>; <HI>e. g.</HI> Giving is a Virtue, when suited in Degree to our Circumstances, but otherwise it is a great <HI>Evil,</HI> as the Apostle observes, such <HI>have denied the Faith, and are worse than Infidels;</HI> it is a <HI>robbing</HI> of our <HI>Fa∣milies,</HI> which we are under special Obligations first to regard and assist; and thus it is in Respect of <HI>A∣buse,</HI> there is a Degree beyond which we cannot go, without encouraging the <HI>Abuser,</HI> then the <HI>Good</HI> that we shou'd return for <HI>Evil,</HI> is <HI>bodily</HI> Correction for their <HI>Insolence,</HI> or the <HI>Discipline</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> which we may hope will learn them better Manners for the future, and deter others: Due <HI>Correction</HI> for <HI>Offences,</HI> is in its Place very necessary, whol∣some, and of excellent Service!</P>
<P>Some may fondly imagine, that an absolute <HI>Leni∣ty</HI> or Mildness towards the <HI>Obstinate</HI> and Rebellious, and a passive Behaviour under their grievous and in∣tollerable <HI>Insults,</HI> is a Christian <HI>Virtue,</HI> and Evi∣dence of <HI>Love;</HI> No! (the Case of Persecution ex∣cepted) if we will admit of the Judgment of <HI>God</HI> himself, it is an Argument of <HI>Hatred; He that spa∣reth the Rod, hates the Child.</HI> It is a real <HI>Vice,</HI> in∣stead of a <HI>Perfection,</HI> which shou'd be sincerely la∣mented, and speedily abandoned! People's sincere Intention no doubt lessens the Malignity of it, but cannot wholly take it away; for whatever is bad in itself, does and will remain so, whatever we think of it notwithstanding; the <HI>Almighty</HI>'s <HI>Patience</HI> has
<PB N="100" REF="006247_0104_102821494D5EB6D8"/>
its Limits, and therefore so shou'd ours; else it is no Sin to be disconform'd to the <HI>Example</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Dictates</HI> of <HI>Reason,</HI> in Things of a <HI>moral Nature,</HI> which is absurd!</P>
<P>We express our <HI>Love</HI> by repelling unjust Violence with <HI>Force,</HI> for hereby our <HI>Enemies</HI> are restrain'd from doing <HI>Mischief,</HI> and bringing the Guilt of <HI>innocent Blood</HI> upon themselves; it is an Instance of <HI>Love</HI> to bind an enraged Man's Hands, from com∣mitting <HI>Murder;</HI> and hence it must needs be so, to resist by <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Arms,</HI> a <HI>bloody Tyrant</HI> that cannot be otherwise restrained!</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3. <HI>V. p.</HI> 39. <Q>If every particular <HI>Member</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> is forbidden Revenge, it is because allowing of it, would manifest a Want of <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Fortitude</HI> to endure, and encourage Envy, Strife, Malice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which produces Destruction to Particulars—</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I deny that the <HI>Reason</HI> of prohibiting <HI>pri∣vate</HI> Revenge, or opposing and punishing Injuries, is because allowing of it would manifest a Want of <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Fortitude</HI> to endure; No! But because it is unreasonable in <HI>Society,</HI> that one shou'd be his own <HI>Judge</HI> in his own <HI>Cause,</HI> when there is any Probability of having the Matter more impartially determin'd by others.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI>'s Reason aforesaid, if I understand it right, implies a gross Reflection upon all that are for <HI>Defensive War,</HI> as if they were a <HI>Sett</HI> of <HI>Cowards;</HI> a Reflection as unjust and unreasonable as it is un∣charitable; for if it be true, there is no such Thing in Nature as active <HI>Fortitude,</HI> which opposes not only the clearest <HI>Dictates</HI> of our <HI>Reason,</HI> but also the express <HI>Testimony</HI> of <HI>God</HI> himself, who has fre∣quently commended the <HI>Heroes</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> for their active <HI>military Bravery;</HI> hence are these high and honourable <HI>Encomiums</HI> upon some, that they were

<P><HI>Object.</HI> 4. <HI>V. p.</HI> 39, 40. <Q>Besides, can those who are separately forbid a Thing, be at <HI>Liberty</HI> collectively to do it—Suppose ten Men are each commanded by their <HI>Prince</HI> to abstain from a Par∣ticular <HI>Dyet,</HI> because it is <HI>pernicious;</HI> it cannot surely be agreeable to that <HI>Prince,</HI> that these ten Men together, should do what separately he for∣bid them; upon this View of the Case, does it look reasonable to suppose, that <HI>Christ</HI> intended to prohibit <HI>private</HI> particular <HI>Revenge,</HI> and allow of <HI>national</HI> and <HI>publick,</HI> to punish lesser Degrees of <HI>Evil,</HI> and justify <HI>greater?</HI> Did he not reprove the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees, for omitting weightier Mat∣ters, whilst they tythed Mint, and Annis, and Cummin.—Ye blind Guides, which strain at a Gnat, and swallow a Camel, Mat.</HI> xxiii. 23, 24.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Here is a bold <HI>Blow</HI> indeed at the <HI>Root</HI> of <HI>Magistracy,</HI> in as plain Words as can be well de∣vis'd; all Execution of publick <HI>Justice,</HI> which the <HI>Almighty</HI> by his <HI>Apostle</HI> calls <HI>Revenge,</HI> or <HI>the Execu∣tion of Wrath upon him that doth Evil,</HI> Rom. xiii. 4. is call'd by our <HI>Author,</HI> in the preceding Paragraph, <HI>pernicious,</HI> a <HI>greater Evil,</HI> yea, as much greater than <HI>private Revenge,</HI> as a <HI>Camel</HI> is to a <HI>Gnat,</HI> and all that <HI>swallow</HI> this <HI>Camel,</HI> or approve of the Execution of <HI>publick Justice,</HI> are represented as <HI>blind Guides,</HI> who like the <HI>Scribes and Pharisees of old, strain at a Gnat, and swallow a Camel.</HI></P>
<P>Large Charity indeed! I confess that if the <HI>Foundation</HI> our Author goes upon, in the aforesaid Reasoning, was just and true, his Consequence wou'd follow, to the utter Overthrow of all <HI>Magis∣tracy</HI> and <HI>Government; i. e.</HI> If opposing of Injuries, or in other Words, <HI>Revenge,</HI> was in it self unlawful, it cou'dn't be made lawful by any <HI>Association</HI> of <HI>In∣dividuals;</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="006247_0106_10282158D3410BF0"/>
but this I deny, and on the contrary as∣sert, that in a State of <HI>Nature,</HI> or when a Man is not joined to <HI>Society,</HI> he may <HI>resist</HI> or <HI>revenge Injury,</HI> but not so in <HI>Society,</HI> in ordinary Cases, be∣cause he is then under Obligation to leave the Mat∣ter of <HI>Wrong</HI> to be determined by the <HI>Magistrate,</HI> when he can get his Determination and Protection: This the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> and Nations, dictate; and this the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Gospel</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> confirm; all which conspire to establish the <HI>Magistrate</HI>'s <HI>Office.</HI></P>
<P>Now if <HI>publick Revenge,</HI> or the Execution of <HI>publick Justice,</HI> be in itself a great <HI>Evil,</HI> then it ne∣cessarily follows, that the <HI>blessed God</HI> himself has ap∣pointed a standing <HI>Office</HI> in the World, in order to carry on a Course of notorious <HI>Iniquity,</HI> namely, the <HI>Magistracy,</HI> which offers an Idea of <HI>God,</HI> that is shocking and horrible! utterly inconsistent with the <HI>essential Purity</HI> of his <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>And yet our <HI>Author</HI> elsewhere, <HI>p.</HI> 31. approves of the <HI>Magistrate</HI>'s <HI>Office,</HI> and the Execution of it, in punishing Transgressors, in these Words; <Q>And the Trust reposed in the <HI>civil Power,</HI> for the Punish∣ment of Evil-doers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> faithfully discharged, we should be so bless'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> To reconcile these Things together, I freely confess, vastly exceeds the Reach of my Understanding!</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 5. In Answer to what I had said in the Sermon, <Q>That if the aforesaid Scripture, <HI>viz. Mat.</HI> v. 44. be taken in a literal Sense, going to Law is as much contradicted thereby, as <HI>Defensive War;</HI> but the former is absurd, and therefore the later.</Q>
<HI>S. p.</HI> 30.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Author</HI> answers in the following Manner.</P>
<P><Q>Where is the Absurdity? There are many pious Christians, that look upon the Precept to extend thus far, and therefore do not sue at Law at all:
<PB N="103" REF="006247_0107_1028215A5B893D78"/>
And if there are others who think it may be done, without contradicting the Text, provided it be done in Uprightness, and without any Hatred, Malice, or Revenge: Yet the Practice of these, doesn't in the least make void the Authority of the Precept, <HI>Resist not Evil,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
<HI>V. p.</HI> 40, 41.</P>
<P>To which I reply, that the aforesaid Answer seems to me to be very strange and evasive; for 1. Mr. <HI>S.</HI> asserts, that there are many pious Chrstians, who look upon the Precept to extend thus far; how far pray? why so that they do not sue at Law at all; <HI>i. e.</HI> if our Author wou'd speak out, they think it wrong for them to go to Law, and so incur the Absurdity mentioned in the <HI>Sermon.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <Q>If there are others, saith our <HI>Author,</HI> who think it may be done, without contradicting the Text, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yet the Practice of these, doesn't make void the Authority of the Precept, <HI>Resist not Evil,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> These Expressions are so dark and dubious, that it is hard to come at our Author's Meaning, which seems to be this, that there are some Christians by Profession, whose Sincerity he questions, that think they can safely go to <HI>Law,</HI> and if they do so, with a right <HI>Temper</HI> of <HI>Mind,</HI> it doesn't lessen the Authority of the Precept afore∣said.</P>
<P>From this Paragraph, I would observe two Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That our <HI>Author</HI> seems to question the graci∣ous State of all those that go to <HI>Law;</HI> this Sense his Words in their Connection easily bear; which is scant <HI>Charity,</HI> and not very consistent with his own Approbation of the <HI>Magistrate</HI>'s <HI>Office!</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He allows that Persons, who think it is right, may go to <HI>Law</HI> without <HI>Hatred,</HI> and if so, why not with such a Disposition to <HI>Battle</HI> for their <HI>Defence?</HI> And so his Cause is in Effect given up!</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="104" REF="006247_0108_1028215C3ADA6030"/>3. Our <HI>Author</HI> doesn't tell us, which of the two Companies aforesaid he is of himself, which it was but proper for him to do. But to proceed.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 5. Is borrowed from Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI>'s <HI>Apo∣logy, V. p.</HI> 41. whole Words are these, <Q>For it is as easy to reconcile the greatest Contradictions, as these Laws of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> with the wicked Practices of <HI>Wars</HI>—Whoever can recon∣cile this, <HI>Resist not Evil,</HI> with resist Violence by Force, may be supposed also to have found a Way to reconcile <HI>God</HI> with the <HI>Devil, Christ</HI> with <HI>Anti-christ,</HI> Light with Darkness, and Good with E∣Evil.</Q></P>
<P>I Answer, Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI>'s Reasoning concludes well against <HI>Offensive War,</HI> between which and <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>Mankind,</HI> as well as <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> there is doubtless an unreconcilable Contradiction!</P>
<P>But seeing <HI>Defensive War</HI> is contrary to <HI>Offensive,</HI> in <HI>Principle</HI> and <HI>End,</HI> as well as <HI>Manner,</HI> it must needs therefore be agreeable to <HI>Love, Goodness,</HI> and our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s <HI>Precept.</HI></P>
<P>If Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI> intends by the aforesaid Reasoning, to signify, that both <HI>Offensive</HI> and <HI>Defensive Wars</HI> are contrary to the <HI>Precept</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Temper</HI> of <HI>Christianity;</HI></P>
<P>Then I may justly turn his own Argument against himself, and say, whoever can reconcile these Con∣traries, <HI>viz.</HI> Offensive and Defensive War, (and reconciled they must be, before they can join in Op∣position to <HI>Love,</HI> the <HI>Precept</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Temper</HI> of <HI>Christianity</HI>) may be supposed also to have found out a Way to reconcile <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>Devil, Christ</HI> and <HI>Antichrist, Light</HI> and <HI>Darkness, Good</HI> and <HI>Evil.</HI></P>
<P>Mr, <HI>Barclay</HI> was doubtless a <HI>Gentleman</HI> of <HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>Ingenuity,</HI> but seeing he was but a <HI>Man uninspi∣red,</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="006247_0109_1028215E04B1C458"/>
he might be mistaken in some Points, as well as other Men.</P>
<P>If we take the <HI>Apologist</HI> in the former Sense, we have him for a <HI>Patron</HI> of <HI>Defensive War;</HI> but if in the latter, he is inconsistent with himself, and runs into the same unsurmountable Absurdities, which he reproves others for, without Foundation!</P>
<P>Our Author proceeds to confute a Passage in the <HI>S. p.</HI> 30, 31. where I say, <Q>That killing of our E∣nemies, is more consistent with <HI>Love</HI> to them, than <HI>Self-murder</HI> is with <HI>Love</HI> to ourselves;' the Reason of which I there represent to be this, <HI>viz.</HI> A greater Degree of <HI>Love</HI> we should bear to our∣selves, and hence this Conclusion is drawn, that when the Safety of others and our own come in Competition; we must rather secure our own.</Q> Well how does our <HI>Author</HI> confute this? Why, in the following Manner, <HI>V. p.</HI> 43.</P>
<P><Q>But are either of these Cases in the least Degree consistent?—Are they not rather as opposite as East to West? A Man can never designedly in∣jure what he really loves, and it is his Duty to love Enemies.</Q></P>
<P>To which I reply, that the aforesaid <HI>Answer</HI> shifts the <HI>State</HI> of the <HI>Question,</HI> and leaves out en∣tirely the <HI>Reason</HI> upon which my <HI>Argument</HI> is bot∣tomed; <HI>e. g.</HI> The Question is not whether we shou'd <HI>love</HI> our Enemies, and avoid <HI>killing</HI> them, as much as can consist with our own <HI>Safety</HI> (for that I had frequently asserted in the <HI>Sermon,</HI> see p. 28, 29, 30) but whether we shou'dn't <HI>love</HI> ourselves in a <HI>greater Degree,</HI> and in Consequence hereof, when their <HI>Lives</HI> and ours come in Competition, so that one must be lost, we shou'd rather secure our own. This Foundation of my Argument he drops entirely. At this Rate of proceeding, our <HI>Author</HI> may with Ease confute any <HI>Book,</HI> that ever was composed!</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="006247_0110_1028216985BDC1D0"/>But our <HI>Author</HI> proceeds to say, <HI>V. p.</HI> 43. as follows; <Q>The Paragraph in p. 31. wherein the <HI>Sermon-writer</HI> undertakes to prove, that no more is meant by Christ's Command to <HI>love</HI> Enemies, than was enjoined under the <HI>Jewish Dispensation,</HI> is (in my Opinion) a Pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of <HI>Sophistry,</HI> and can∣not be reconciled with the Manner in which our Saviour introduceth this Doctrine, <HI>You have heard that it hath been said,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Pray <HI>Sir</HI> cool a little; <HI>Sophistry;</HI> why so? Cannot be reconcil'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—Why so? Where is the Proof?—Here we have warm Words, and nothing else!</P>
<P>But because great <HI>Stress</HI> in this Argument is laid by the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of the other Side of the <HI>Question,</HI> upon the aforesaid Words of our <HI>Saviour, against resist∣ing Evil, Mat.</HI> v. which I think they misunderstand, I will therefore take the Liberty to enlarge more up∣on this important Part of the Argument.</P>
<P>And here let me enquire, if the Words of <HI>not re∣sisting Evil,</HI> be taken in their strict, literal Sense, without <HI>Limitation,</HI> then why not the following <HI>Precepts</HI> about <HI>giving</HI> and <HI>borrowing?</HI> Either all shou'd be understood absolutely and literally, or none of them.</P>
<P>Is it not unreasonable to imagine, that we should be obliged, by the <HI>Laws</HI> of Christianity, to give to one that ask'd, that we knew either did not need it, or in all Probability would make a bad Use of it, or to give without our being able to afford it, to the Prejudice of our <HI>Families?</HI> In one of these Cases we should encourage another in <HI>Wickedness,</HI> and so be Parta∣ker of their Sins; and in the other, oppose a just, natural Affection to our <HI>Families,</HI> and so, as the Apostle observes, be <HI>worse than Infidels!</HI></P>
<P>If a Man by an unjust <HI>Law-suit</HI> takes away our <HI>Coat,</HI> is it reasonable to take this Passage of <HI>giving
<PB N="107" REF="006247_0111_1028216B1ECE7D68"/>
him our Cloak also</HI> in a literal Sense? Isn't this to encourage him in Wickedness, not only to be en∣tirely <HI>passive</HI> under the Wrong, but to give him as much more of our Goods gratis? Can it be thought the <HI>Laws</HI> of an allwise <HI>God,</HI> rightly understood, wou'd thus fight against each other? Shou'dn't we interpret Scripture according to the <HI>Analogy</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> in such a Way as to make it Self-consistent?</P>
<P>If the following <HI>Precepts</HI> do oblige to <HI>give</HI> and <HI>lend,</HI> at the meer <HI>Pleasure</HI> of the <HI>Asker,</HI> or <HI>Borrow∣er,</HI> without any Regard had either to their Wants; or our Abilities, then their <HI>Lusts</HI> or unreasonable Desires, are to be the <HI>Rule</HI> of our Proceeding in the aforesaid Points, and not <HI>Scripture</HI> or <HI>Reason;</HI> and if the Case be so, how then is <HI>Religion a reasonable Service?</HI> How then can we order our Affairs with <HI>Discretion?</HI> How then can we be said to have any <HI>Property</HI> in our <HI>Goods,</HI> seeing we are obliged, upon the aforesaid <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> to <HI>give to every Ask∣er and Borrower, and not to turn away?</HI></P>
<P>An impudent <HI>Beggar</HI> may come an hundred Times in a Day, or more, and clear us of all our <HI>Cash;</HI> an unreasonable <HI>Borrower</HI> may come as of∣ten, and strip our <HI>Houses</HI> in the like Space, so that we sha'n't have a <HI>Stool</HI> to sit on, or a <HI>Bed</HI> to lie on; and may they not also, in the like Space, strip our <HI>Persons,</HI> so that we sha'n't have a <HI>Rag</HI> to cover us?</P>
<P>Who then has the greatest <HI>Right</HI> to our <HI>Goods,</HI> the impudent <HI>Beggar,</HI> the unreasonable <HI>Borrower,</HI> or the <HI>Owner?</HI> I Answer, the <HI>Beggar</HI> and the <HI>Bor∣rower;</HI> for they can, according to this Sense of the Words, dispose of our <HI>Money</HI> and <HI>Goods</HI> according to their <HI>Lusts,</HI> and we dare not hinder them, even tho' our <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Conscience</HI> shou'd oppose; No! instead of that, we must help the <HI>Vagrants</HI> forward in their Wickedness; to the Ruin of our
<PB N="108" REF="006247_0112_1028216CCEE9A850"/>
selves and Families, or act in direct Opposition to the favourite <HI>Principle</HI> of <HI>absolute Non-resistance,</HI> (which we are supposed to entertain) which it seems is not to be given! Is this the <HI>Gospel</HI> of <HI>Jesus?</HI> Can such an unreasonable, unaccountable <HI>Religion,</HI> come from the <HI>allwise, good God?</HI> If this be sup∣pos'd, then I wou'd enquire, whether the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> be not worse in Respect of <HI>Property,</HI> than the <HI>Jewish, Mahometan,</HI> or <HI>Pagan?</HI> Was there e∣ver since the Foundations of the Earth were laid, such an irrational <HI>Religion!</HI></P>
<P>Well, if to avoid the aforesaid Consequences, the <HI>Precepts</HI> of <HI>Giving</HI> and <HI>Lending,</HI> must be taken in a limited, restrained Sense, <HI>viz.</HI> To signify a mer∣ciful, beneficent Temper and Disposition of Mind, regulated in its Exercise by Reason, judging of our own and others Circumstances, so as not to give a∣way all we have, to <HI>lazy Lurches,</HI> sturdy <HI>Beggars,</HI> unconscionable unmannerly <HI>Borrowers;</HI> then why shou'dn't we take the <HI>Precept</HI> about <HI>Resistance,</HI> in a limited Sense too? Isn't the <HI>Reason</HI> the same, the <HI>Form</HI> of Expression the same, and the absurd and perilous Consequences more than equal? Or are our <HI>Persons</HI> less worth protecting, than our <HI>Cash</HI> or <HI>Goods?</HI></P>
<P>Not to add, that there is nothing annexed to this <HI>Precept</HI> of <HI>Giving,</HI> which intimates a <HI>Restriction,</HI> but it is only to be inferr'd by the <HI>Dictates</HI> of <HI>Rea∣son,</HI> and the <HI>Rules</HI> of <HI>Equity;</HI> whereas the <HI>Precept</HI> respecting <HI>Resistance,</HI> has its <HI>Explication</HI> adjoin'd, which implies a <HI>Limitation,</HI> viz. that of <HI>Smiting us on the Cheek,</HI> which can intend no more than smal∣ler and tolerable Injuries; is it not therefore exceed∣ing unreasonable in any, to Hold the Limitation of the former, and not of the latter?</P>
<P>Moreover, to illustrate this Case yet further, let it be observed, that we are commanded by our <HI>Sa∣viour,</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="006247_0113_10282171347E7A00"/>
in the sixth Chapter of <HI>Matthew, To take no Thought for To-morrow, what we shall eat, or what we shall drink, nor yet for our Bodies, what we shall put on, seeing that God, who clothes the Lillies, and feeds the Sparrows, will abundantly provide for his Children, who are much better than many Sparrows.</HI> The Form of Expression here is as <HI>absolute</HI> as the other about <HI>not resisting Evil;</HI> and yet if it is taken literally, without any Limitation, it destroys at a <HI>Stroke</HI> all human <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Diligence,</HI> all prudent Foresight; for have the <HI>Lillies</HI> and <HI>Sparrows</HI> any of these?</P>
<P>Now, if the aforesaid <HI>Precept</HI> be taken absolute∣ly, can any <HI>Merchant</HI> carry on his Business? Can he, without any Thought of To-morrow, buy <HI>Bills,</HI> and send them to <HI>England?</HI> Send Vessels to Sea, and never think of the Time of their return∣ing?</P>
<P>Or can a <HI>Shopkeeper</HI> carry on his <HI>Business</HI> of buy∣ing <HI>Goods,</HI> without any Thought of selling them a∣gain? Or sell them, without any Thought of the Time of Payment? Or if he did so, would it an∣swer? Must not he shut up Shop?</P>
<P>If the <HI>Tradesman</HI> must not think of To-morrow, how shall he inform his <HI>Customers</HI> when they may expect their Work? Or if they want ready Money, how shall he tell them of a Time of Payment?</P>
<P>And how can a <HI>Farmer</HI> carry on his <HI>Husbandry</HI> according to this Notion? Can he <HI>plow</HI> rationally, and never think of the Time of <HI>sowing;</HI> or <HI>sow</HI> rationally, and never think of the Time of <HI>reaping?</HI> Then if the aforesaid <HI>Precept</HI> to avoid such Absur∣dities, must be taken in a restrained, limited Sense, as signifying no <HI>anxious Thought,</HI> why not the other about <HI>Resistance</HI> much more; in as much as <HI>the Life is more than Meat, and the Body than Rai∣ment?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="006247_0114_1028217A6C887F58"/>Seeing that the <HI>End</HI> of <HI>Civil Government</HI> is to se∣cure civil <HI>Property</HI> by Force and Compulsion, when Necessity requires; and hence the <HI>Magistrate</HI> is said to carry the <HI>Sword;</HI> if <HI>Property</HI> must be tame∣ly given up to every unjust Invader, the <HI>End</HI> of <HI>Go∣vernment</HI> being destroyed, there is therefore no Need of the <HI>Mean;</HI> and hence it follows, that <HI>civil Go∣vernment</HI> is a <HI>needless,</HI> superfluous <HI>Institution,</HI> unless it be said, that a <HI>Mean</HI> should be used without an <HI>End,</HI> or for nothing, which is absurd!</P>

<P>Surely <HI>Defensive War</HI> is necessarily included in the <HI>Magistrate</HI>'s Office, seeing that he, instead of sub∣mitting to the <HI>Violence</HI> of <HI>Criminals, resists</HI> and kills them, for the <HI>Defence</HI> and <HI>Advantage</HI> of the <HI>Pub∣lick;</HI> and what does <HI>Defensive War</HI> do more?

<P>If <HI>civil Government,</HI> as described by the <HI>Apostle Paul,</HI> be agreeable to the <HI>Gospel</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and yet that <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Fighting</HI> is <HI>essential</HI> to the very <HI>Being</HI> and Preservation of it, in some Cases, it will fol∣low, unavoidably, that <HI>Defensive War</HI> is, when Ne∣cessity requires, lawful, and agreeable to the <HI>Gospel;</HI> the Reason of the Consequence is this, that there is an exact <HI>Parallel</HI> between the two in all Things ma∣terial.</P>
<P>The <HI>Substance</HI> of both is the same, <HI>viz. Force, Fighting, Bloodshed,</HI> and <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="006247_0115_1028217C000F1360"/>The <HI>Authority</HI> enjoining both is the same, <HI>viz.</HI> of the <HI>Magistrate.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>End</HI> of both is the same, <HI>namely,</HI> to execute <HI>Justice</HI> upon those that deserve it, to preserve <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Property,</HI> and promote the <HI>Good</HI> of the <HI>State.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Necessity</HI> of both is the same; <HI>namely,</HI> that easier <HI>Measures,</HI> at some times, and in some Cases, will not, cannot answer the aforesaid <HI>Ends.</HI></P>
<P>Now, that <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Fighting</HI> are in some Cases <HI>essential</HI> to <HI>civil Government,</HI> appears both from <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Reason;</HI> hence a <HI>Sword</HI> is assigned, a∣scribed to the <HI>Magistrate,</HI> and he is said <HI>not to bear it in vain; i. e.</HI> when he acts up to his <HI>Office,</HI> he is, as the Apostle observes, <HI>a Terror to Evil-doers, a Revenger to execute Wrath,</HI> and that in some Ca∣ses to <HI>Bloodshed</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> upon him that <HI>doth E∣vil,</HI> Rom. xiii. Now, if these Things do not imply <HI>Force,</HI> what does?</P>
<P>All acknowledge that <HI>Laws</HI> are necessary to <HI>Go∣vernment;</HI> now, can these be put in Execution upon <HI>Criminals</HI> always without <HI>Force,</HI> without <HI>Fighting?</HI> Then certainly they are grown much better hu∣moured of late than formerly!</P>
<P>What has come to pass, may again, in the like Circumstances. Does not History inform us of ma∣ny <HI>Tumults</HI> and Insurrections that have been? And in such Cases, if the <HI>Sword</HI> be not drawn, and used, will not the Magistrate be trampled under Foot, his <HI>Office</HI> contemned as a silly <HI>Cypher,</HI> all <HI>Order</HI> be over∣set, <HI>Justice</HI> perverted, <HI>Property</HI> unhinged, and a universal <HI>Chaos</HI> succeed, in which the <HI>Honours,</HI> the <HI>Goods,</HI> the <HI>Lives</HI> of the Innocent, are made a <HI>Prey</HI> to lawless and rapacious <HI>Violence!</HI> If a <HI>Magistrate</HI> pronounces <HI>Sentence</HI> against a <HI>Criminal,</HI> and no Force is to be used for the <HI>Execution</HI> of it, would not the Criminal, in all Probability, especially if ap∣prized of this, insult him with the greatest Rudeness,
<PB N="112" REF="006247_0116_1028217DD459D2D8"/>
<HI>kick</HI> him and <HI>cuff</HI> him on the <HI>Bench,</HI> for daring to offer such an Affront to a Person of his Dignity and Extraction?</P>
<P>Supposing, what has often happened, that a Cri∣minal, legally condemned, should fly from <HI>Justice,</HI> and refuse to be taken, and, being <HI>armed,</HI> would declare that he would not be taken alive, what is to be done in this Case? Is <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Arms</HI> to be used or not, to bring him to Punishment? If not, then civil <HI>Laws,</HI> and civil <HI>Government,</HI> are but a meer <HI>Sham,</HI> not worth a <HI>Rush,</HI> for the <HI>Protection</HI> of <HI>Pro∣perty,</HI> and <HI>Execution</HI> of <HI>Justice;</HI> a poor, contempti∣ble <HI>Institution,</HI> of no <HI>Authority</HI> and <HI>Influence,</HI> a fit Object for <HI>Derision</HI> and <HI>Ridicule!</HI> If yes, then <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Arms</HI> are lawful to defend <HI>Property,</HI> and execute <HI>Justice,</HI> which is the Point in Question!</P>
<P>But what if the Number of <HI>Villains</HI> be greater, who join in Confederacy to affront <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Justice,</HI> to wrong a Community, either in their <HI>Lives</HI> or <HI>Properties,</HI> or both; does not it necessarily follow, upon the same <HI>Plan</HI> of Reasoning, that a greater <HI>Force</HI> of Men in Arms be sent to bring them to <HI>Ju∣stice?</HI> For can the <HI>Number</HI> reasonably exempt them from the <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> of the Law, seeing it does not lessen the Crime of each? No! but on the contrary their Confederacy encreases their Crime, as well as the <HI>Danger</HI> of the publick <HI>Safety;</HI> and therefore they must be opposed in Arms, except it be suppo∣sed, that lesser Crimes should be punished, but not greater; lesser Dangers guarded against, but not greater; which, if it be not absurd, I know not what is!</P>
<P>Well, has a <HI>foreign</HI> Enemy any better <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>rob</HI> and <HI>murder</HI> us, than <HI>Rogues</HI> of our own <HI>Na∣tion?</HI> If yea, let it be produced; if nay, then why should not we oppose them with equal Care and Force, in order to maintain the <HI>Honour</HI> of our <HI>King,</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="006247_0117_1028217FA39FCBF8"/>
the <HI>Safety</HI> of our <HI>Country,</HI> our <HI>Lives,</HI> our <HI>Liberties,</HI> our <HI>Goods,</HI> from <HI>Violence</HI> and <HI>Ruin!</HI></P>
<P>If the forming of good <HI>Laws,</HI> and annexing pro∣per <HI>Penalties</HI> to them, be agreeable to <HI>God,</HI> and good Men; why not the Execution of those <HI>Penal∣ties</HI> upon <HI>Delinquents,</HI> without which they are but insignificant <HI>Scarecrows,</HI> of no Moment or Influ∣ence?</P>
<P>If we regard good <HI>Laws,</HI> is this Regard well ex∣pressed, by our tamely suffering them, without Op∣position, to be trod under Foot, and consequently the Government and Privileges built upon them, o∣verturned and destroyed!</P>
<P>Pray what is <HI>civil Government,</HI> but the <HI>Union</HI> of <HI>Individuals,</HI> for the effectual <HI>Protection</HI> of <HI>Person</HI> and <HI>Property,</HI> from <HI>Injustice</HI> and <HI>Violence?</HI> What is it but a <HI>Union</HI> of many, to do that for the publick <HI>Good,</HI> which is not in its own <HI>Nature</HI> sinful for par∣ticular Persons to do, who are not united to <HI>Society,</HI> but what they frequently have not <HI>Power</HI> to do; to remedy therefore this Inconvenience, is the <HI>Design</HI> of <HI>social Union,</HI> whereby a sufficient <HI>Measure</HI> of <HI>Power</HI> is by common Consent treasured up, for the Good and <HI>Security</HI> of all the Members of that <HI>Body;</HI> which <HI>Power</HI> is to be used to the aforesaid valuable <HI>Purposes,</HI> upon proper Occasions, as the publick <HI>Managers</HI> or <HI>Officers</HI> of the <HI>Society</HI> shall di∣rect.</P>
<P>Hence it is that Persons who are <HI>wronged,</HI> or in Danger of being so, and unable to right or guard themselves, reasonably fly to the <HI>Magistrate</HI> for <HI>Ju∣stice</HI> and <HI>Protection.</HI></P>
<P>This I think is a just Representation of the <HI>Na∣ture</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> of <HI>civil Government;</HI> and therefore I see not how it is possible for the Wit of Man to reconcile to it the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of absolute <HI>Non-Resi∣stance;</HI> for if it be unjust in itself for a <HI>private Per∣son</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="006247_0118_1028218C98501F00"/>
to <HI>resist</HI> in all Cases, it must be so also for a greater Number, as our <HI>Author</HI> has well observed, <HI>V. p.</HI> 39, 40. It must be so likewise for the <HI>Magi∣strate;</HI> for a <HI>Union</HI> of <HI>Individuals</HI> can never alter the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Things,</HI> or make that which is in itself <HI>unjust,</HI> to be <HI>just,</HI> as our <HI>Author</HI> fairly reasons in the aforesaid Pages, but from a false <HI>Principle.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can the <HI>Almighty,</HI> to speak with Reverence of his <HI>Majesty,</HI> in a Consistency with the <HI>Purity</HI> and Perfection of his <HI>Nature,</HI> give <HI>Authority</HI> to do what is in itself <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>unjust;</HI> and therefore this Con∣sequence easily and unavoidably follows, That <HI>civil Government,</HI> and the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of absolute <HI>Non-Resi∣stance,</HI> are <HI>Asustata,</HI> incompatible, irreconcilable <HI>Contradictions!</HI> And likewise,</P>
<P>Hence it follows, that such as are for any one of them, must, if they would consist with themselves, give up the other.</P>
<P>It is true, the <HI>Colourings</HI> of <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Address,</HI> the <HI>Subtleties</HI> of <HI>indefinite Terms, Evasion</HI> and <HI>Subter∣fuge,</HI> may cast a <HI>Mist</HI> of seeming <HI>Confusion</HI> over these plain Things, so as to mislead the Unwary, Partial, and Injudicious; but they can never blend them together, or really weld them into one Piece, without a <HI>Botch</HI> that may be discerned without the Help of <HI>Spectacles!</HI></P>
<P>I may add, that such who think it sinful to <HI>resist</HI> in any Case, and yet approve of the <HI>Magistrate</HI>'s <HI>resisting</HI> in some Cases, do virtually approve of, and thereby become accessary to what they themselves condemn as sinful; which, whether it be either inno∣cent or consistent, let the Reader judge. But to proceed.</P>
<P>As to our <HI>Author</HI>'s Reflections, <HI>V. p.</HI> 46. upon my being <HI>affected</HI> with a <HI>View</HI> of the melancholly <HI>Circumstances</HI> of this <HI>People,</HI> in case of an <HI>Enemy</HI>'s coming suddenly upon them, unprepared for <HI>De∣fence,</HI>

considering that it was not without <HI>Cause,</HI> which that rational, catholick, and manly Perfor∣mance, PLAIN TRUTH, makes unanswerably evi∣dent, and was a generous Concern for <HI>others Safety</HI> more than my own; and likewise considering, that the holy Scriptures represent <HI>fearing always</HI> to be the <HI>Character</HI> of a wise and good Man, and that their Practice is accordingly. Thus <HI>righteous Noah being moved with Fear, prepared an Ark, to the sav∣ing of his House, by which he condemned the World.</HI> Thus pious <HI>Jehoshaphat, hearing of the Design of the Ammonites and M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lites to invade his Kingdom, feared, and set himself to seek the Lord, and pro∣claimed a Fast throughout all Judah.</HI> Thus the <HI>Man after God's own Heart trembled for fear of God's Judgments!</HI> I say, considering all these Things, it is something strange that our <HI>Author</HI> should represent me, on account of the aforesaid <HI>Concern,</HI> which he is pleased to term <HI>musing,</HI> as of a <HI>Temper</HI> of <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>State</HI> very different fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m <HI>Christianity,</HI> which I freely forgive, and look upon his groundless <HI>Satyr</HI> as an honourable <HI>Panegyrick!</HI> In so great, so good a <HI>Cause,</HI> as <HI>Concern</HI> for my <HI>Country</HI>'s <HI>Safety,</HI> and an honest <HI>Essay</HI> to promote it, it is my <HI>Glory,</HI> and my <HI>Joy,</HI> to endure <HI>Invective!</HI></P>
<P>As to our <HI>Author</HI>'s Observations from some Pas∣sages out of the <HI>Prophets, V. p.</HI> 47, 48. these Scrip∣tures being, in my Opinion, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to <HI>Isaiah</HI> ii. 4. which I have before explained and considered, I think that Answer is sufficient here; and therefore, for the sake of Brevity, shall not add at present.</P>

<P>As we are reasonable, accountable <HI>Creatures,</HI> 'tis fit we should do so, for another can't answer for our <HI>Conduct</HI> to God, in our Place. The best of Men, are but Men at the best; <HI>We see but in Part,</HI> and therefore in Part we may err; and this indeed is but <HI>human</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Humanum est err<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Give me leave to offer a Word to our Author, by Way of Query, respecting divers uncharitable Sentences in his <HI>Vindication,</HI> SOME of which I have mentioned in this <HI>Reply.</HI></P>
<P>Pray, <HI>Sir,</HI> Isn't judging the <HI>States</HI> of others, on Account of a suppos'd or real <HI>Mistake</HI> in <HI>Principle,</HI> respecting Things not <HI>essential</HI> to <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Sal∣vation,</HI> contrary to the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s <HI>Chain</HI> of Reason∣ings, in the 14th Chapter of his <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Ro∣mans;</HI> and in very Deed, a <HI>Degree</HI> of real <HI>Persecu∣tion</HI> for <HI>Religion?</HI> And does this <HI>Persecution</HI> consist well with <HI>passive Principles?</HI></P>
<P>And seeing that vastly the greater Part of the Christian <HI>World</HI> are for <HI>Defensive War,</HI> and many of them live sober and regular Lives, and are ac∣quainted with experimental <HI>Religion,</HI> and consider∣ing that they have herein the Concurrence of all the Rest of <HI>Mankind,</HI> does it look so decent and hum∣ble like as cou'd be wished, to treat them with an Appearance of <HI>Slight,</HI> and to condemn their <HI>States?</HI></P>
<P>It is no Doubt a great Duty to depend on divine <HI>Providence,</HI> in the regular Use of all appointed Means; but if we may, without <HI>Presumption</HI> and Impunity, depend in the Neglect of one Mean,
<PB N="117" REF="006247_0121_102821926F2A5B28"/>
may we not, by a Parity of Reason, in the Neglect of more, and consequently of all, and thus become intirely unactive, when we come to the <HI>Perfection</HI> of <HI>Virtue;</HI> a strange Sort of Perfection indeed, a Per∣fection of <HI>Sloth</HI> and Indolence!</P>
<P>But before I conclude this <HI>Reply,</HI> I think it ne∣cessary to consider those <HI>Instances</HI> which our <HI>Author</HI> has brought from <HI>Antiquity,</HI> for the Confirmation of his <HI>Opinion,</HI> and that with a sufficient Degree of <HI>Confidence,</HI> that the <HI>primitive Church</HI> was upon his Side of the Question.</P>
<P>Before I enter upon this Point, I would observe, that I had not meddled with the <HI>Fathers,</HI> in the <HI>Sermon</HI> he is pleased to animadvert upon, as be∣lieving that the <HI>Merit</HI> of the <HI>Cause</HI> in Controversy, does not depend upon their <HI>Testimony,</HI> but upon the Suffrage of <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Reason:</HI> They were fal∣lible Men as well as others, and had no other <HI>Rule</HI> to direct their Sentiments and Conduct, but what we have; no <HI>Antiquity,</HI> or human <HI>Authority,</HI> can alter the Nature and Reason of Things; or justly commend to our Esteem and Acceptance, what is erroneus or absurd!</P>
<P>I have not mentioned these Things from any Diffidence respecting the <HI>Fathers,</HI> as tho' they were not for <HI>Defensive War,</HI> No! But to fix the <HI>Stress</HI> of the <HI>Controversy</HI> upon its proper <HI>Basis.</HI></P>
<P>At the Beginning of the <HI>Reformation</HI> (if I remem∣ber right) in the <HI>Disputes</HI> between the <HI>Protestants</HI> and <HI>Papists,</HI> the latter often urged, that the <HI>Fathers,</HI> together with the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> shou'd be appeal'd to as determining <HI>Judges</HI> thereof, but the former just∣ly rejected the Proposal.</P>
<P>After some Enquiry, I cannot yet find, that our <HI>Author</HI> had any Ground of <HI>Triumph,</HI> in Respect of the <HI>Fathers:</HI> However, after having offered my Reasons, I freely leave this Point to the Judgment of
<PB N="118" REF="006247_0122_1028219DEE7F4260"/>
the impartial <HI>Reader;</HI> to this End therefore let it be observed, That in order to have a just View of the <HI>Sentiments</HI> of the <HI>Fathers</HI> concerning <HI>War,</HI> it is necessary, in my Opinion, to understand and consi∣der these following Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THAT they taught unanimously, that the <HI>Church</HI> had no material <HI>Sword,</HI> or civil Power, to force or punish Men; that she cou'd only entreat, admonish, and excommunicate those that wou'dn't obey, or were refractory and obstinate. They also plainly distinguished between the <HI>State</HI> and the <HI>Church,</HI> and ascrib'd a temporal Sword to the for∣mer, and a spiritual to the latter; agreeable hereto, these following <HI>Fathers</HI> speak.</P>
<P><HI>Tertullian</HI> saith, <Q>That it is not the Business of <HI>Religion</HI> to force Religion, or use Compulsion to that End <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">'Non est religionis, inquit, cogere religionem.' <HI>In lib. ad Scap.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Lactantius</HI> saith, <Q>That there is no Need of <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Injury,</HI> because <HI>Religion</HI> cannot be forced— and that it is to be defended not by killing, but by dying <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Non est, inquit, opus vi et injuriâ, quia religio cogi non potest;—defendenda est non occidendo, sed moriendo.</Q>

<P><HI>Athanasius</HI> in like Manner observes, <Q>That the <HI>Truth</HI> is to be preached not with <HI>Swords</HI> or <HI>Darts,</HI> or with a military Hand, but by <HI>Perswasion</HI> and <HI>Council.</HI> It is the Property of sincere Religion, as I have said, not to force, but to perswade; thus the Lord did not compel, but granting Liberty, said to all, If any will come after me; and to the Apostles in Particular, Will ye also go away <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Non enim gladiis, aut jaculis, aut militari manu veri∣tas predicatur, sed suadendo et consulendo piae religionis est proprium, ut dixi, non cogere, sed suadere.

<P><HI>Augustine</HI> in his Exposition of the Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> speaks with great Clearness and Judgment, and very largely upon this Head, a little of which I would cite; <Q>Seeing, saith he, we consist of <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Soul,</HI> while we possess this temporal Life, we use temporal Things for the Support of it: It be∣hoves us in that Part which respects this Life, to

be subject to the civil Government; but in Re∣gard of that Part by which we believe in God, and are call'd into his Kingdom, we shou'd not be subject to any Man who endeavours to overthrow that which the Almighty has been pleased to give us, in Order to eternal Life. If any one thinks, because he is a Christian, that therefore he shou'd not pay the <HI>Taxes,</HI> or offer due <HI>Honour</HI> to those that are in civil Authority, he is in a great Er∣ror; but if any one thinks that he shou'd be sub∣ject to them, in Matters of <HI>Faith,</HI> he is in a greater <HI>Error:</HI> That Measure is to be observ'd, which the Lord himself has prescrib'd, <HI>That we should render to Caesar, the Things that are Caesar</HI>'s, <HI>and to God, the Things that are God's.</HI> If they take from us our temporal Substance, we shou'd not resist; because it is necessary, on Ac∣count of this Life, to be in Subjection, not only <HI>to escape Wrath, but for Conscience sake</HI>

<P>The aforesaid Particulars shed an easy Light upon the <HI>Writings</HI> of the <HI>Fathers</HI> respecting <HI>War,</HI> and plainly prove, that those Passages in them that seem contrary thereto, only intend their Aversion, either to the Method of propagating <HI>Religion</HI> by <HI>Force,</HI> or

<P>Having premis'd the aforesaid Particulars, I pro∣ceed to observe, That the most ancient <HI>Writers</HI> of the <HI>Christian Church,</HI> manifest their Approbation of inflicting <HI>capital Punishments,</HI> and <HI>Defensive War,</HI> the Reasonableness and Justice of which depends up∣on the former, and is indeed the same Thing sub∣stantially with it, as I trust I have before prov'd.</P>

<P><HI>Query</HI> 1. Why does the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> speaking by the Scriptures, put such Honour upon <HI>Soldiers,</HI> even under the <HI>New Testament,</HI> if the Profession be sinful?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 2. Why were such admitted to <HI>Baptism,</HI> or <HI>added to the Church</HI> by his infallible Direction, without any Profession of <HI>Sorrow,</HI> for being con∣cerned in the military Business in Time past, with∣out any Promise of discontinuing in it for the fu∣ture? (See <HI>Acts</HI> x. 2, 7, 41) How can these Things be reconcil'd to the <HI>Purity</HI> of the blessed <HI>Spirit,</HI> and to the <HI>Government</HI> he has instituted in the <HI>Church,</HI> upon the Supposition of the Sinfulness of <HI>Defensive War?</HI> Didn't gross Offenders, that were baptized by <HI>John,</HI> confess their Sins first, be∣fore they were admitted to be Members of the Christian Church by Baptism? See <HI>Mat.</HI> iii.6.</P>
<P>If the military Business be sinful under the <HI>Gospel,</HI> then <HI>Cornelius</HI> (the Prefect, or Captain over a hun∣dred Soldiers, as the Word <HI>Ecatontarches</HI> signifies) and his <HI>Soldier</HI> Attendant, liv'd in a Course of Sin, which the Scriptures represent to be a Sign of a dam∣nable State, <HI>He that commits Sin, is of the Devil:</HI> Then,</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 3. How is it that both are honoured by an inspired Person, with the Character of <HI>devout</HI> and <HI>pious,</HI> or right Worshippers of God, which the Word (<HI>Eusebes a eu bene et sebo colo</HI>) signifies? How can these Things consist together?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Soldiers</HI> that suffered Torments and Death for the <HI>Cause</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> received the same <HI>Honours</HI> from
<PB N="131" REF="006247_0135_102821D779342658"/>
the Church with other Martyrs, as it afterwards mentioned, which surely they never would have gi∣ven, if they had not looked upon <HI>Defensive War</HI> to be lawful.</P>
<P>The following Words of eloquent and pious <HI>Cy∣prian</HI> are very memorable and full to this Purpose; <Q><HI>Laurentinus</HI> and <HI>Ignatius,</HI> saith he, did heretofore bear ARMS in secular CAMPS, but in the mean time were true, spiritual <HI>Soldiers</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> while by the Concurrence of <HI>Christ</HI> they vanquished <HI>Satan,</HI> they merited <HI>Palms</HI> of the LORD, and <HI>Crowns,</HI> by their illustrious <HI>Passion;</HI> we always make ho∣nourable Mention of them on every anniversary Day, in which we celebrate the <HI>Memory</HI> of the <HI>Martyrs Passions</HI>

<P>Among all that Multitude of <HI>Canons</HI> respecting <HI>Discipline,</HI> which were made by the various Coun∣cils of the Eastern and Western Churches, at their rumerous <HI>Sessions,</HI> during the first five Centuries af∣ter Christ, tho' many of them were severe respect∣ing divers Abuses; yet, after some <HI>Search</HI> and <HI>En∣quiry,</HI> I cannot find one <HI>Canon</HI> in all the <HI>Catalogue</HI> against <HI>Defensive War,</HI> as unlawful in itself; or any C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, whereby <HI>Laymen</HI> are authoritatively debarred of <HI>Church Fellowship,</HI> or of <HI>Baptism,</HI> and the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>Supper,</HI> for their engaging in it: And can any rea∣sonably imagine, that this would have been wholly passed over, if the <HI>Judgment</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> had been against it! Nor do I know of any <HI>Canon</HI> made by any Council or Synod of <HI>Ministers</HI> against <HI>Lay-persons</HI> (who had not done Penance) engaging in a <HI>Defensive War,</HI> when no <HI>sinful</HI> and ensnaring <HI>Terms</HI> were proposed, for 1500 Years after Christ; so that it is surprizing to me, that our <HI>Author</HI> should so strongly imagine the <HI>primitive Church</HI> to be on his Side of the Question!</P>

the <HI>Persians,</HI> were so far from discouraging him in this Enterprize, that they willingly promised to follow him to the <HI>Wars,</HI> and fight against his Ene∣mies, by the spiritual Warfare of Prayers to God for him. In this Expedition, saith <HI>Eusebius,</HI> he seemed to follow them, and commanded a <HI>Taber∣nacle</HI> or <HI>Tent</HI> to be built in Fashion of a <HI>Church,</HI> wherein he and his <HI>Bishops</HI> might pray unto <HI>God,</HI> the Giver of Victories.</Q>
<HI>Eusebius on the Life of Constantine, p.</HI> 69.</P>
<P>This Instance clearly proves, that the primitive Christians were for <HI>Defensive War;</HI> this was the first Time of their being clothed with civil Authority as a <HI>State</HI> (and surely they could not act as a <HI>State</HI> be∣fore they were one) Now they had a <HI>Prince</HI> of their own <HI>Religion</HI> at their Head; now they could <HI>fight</HI> in <HI>Defence</HI> of their <HI>Country,</HI> without complying with <HI>idolatrous Terms;</HI> and therefore this was the proper Time for them to declare their Opinion, and to act according to it, and this we see they did.</P>
<P>Pray, where is there any Instance of a Christian's refusing to serve in the <HI>War</HI> in <HI>Constantine</HI>'s Reign? It was so far from this, <Q>That an <HI>Act</HI> was made to restore <HI>Professors</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> to their <HI>military Offi∣ces,</HI> who had been deprived of them for their Con∣stancy and Courage in the Cause of <HI>Religion</HI> by <HI>persecuting Princes;</HI> and consequently we find a Number of Christians in his <HI>Army.</HI> He gave Li∣berty and Vacancy, saith <HI>Eusebius,</HI> to those who by a divine Instinct had embraced the <HI>Faith,</HI> that they might freely frequent the <HI>Church</HI> of God, and offer up their <HI>Prayers</HI> to him; for he said, they ought not to use their <HI>Spears</HI> only, or put their <HI>Confidence</HI> in <HI>Weapons</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI> of <HI>Body;</HI> but to acknowledge <HI>God</HI> the Giver of <HI>Victory,</HI> to whom with Hearts and Hands lifted up to <HI>Heaven,</HI> we ought to render due <HI>Praise</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> and be∣seech

<P>Moreover the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Africa,</HI> makes Use of the aforesaid Passage in Order to justify their Reso∣lution, of imploring the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Assistance a∣gainst the Factious; for thus they speak, <Q>Against whose <HI>Fury</HI> we may call for such <HI>Defence,</HI> as is not unusual, or disallow'd by the <HI>Scripture;</HI> since the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> as we read in the Book of <HI>Acts,</HI> secur'd himself against a Conspiracy of factious Men, by a military Force.</Q></P>

<P><Q>The Substance of this memorable and miracu∣lous Deliverance, says <HI>Echard,</HI> is sufficiently con∣firmed, both by the Christian and Pagan Writers; who unanimously ascribe it to the Power of God. Some of those Writers liv'd almost in the same Age, all of them before Learning was sunk, <HI>Di∣on Cassius</HI> has given us a particular Account of it, and ascribes it to some divine Power assisting the Emperor.—Other Heathen Writers, as <HI>Capitoli∣nus, Themistius,</HI> and <HI>Claudian,</HI> ascribe it to the Prevalency of the <HI>Emperors</HI> own Prayers.—The Care that the <HI>Pagans</HI> took to carry off the Ho∣nour of this miraculous Event, serves, at least, to confirm the Truth of the Fact. And without Fear of being tho't too credulous, or endeavour∣ing to support the Christian <HI>Religion</HI> by Fable and Falshood, Artifices it never needed, we shall affirm, that there is no Reason to reject the Tes∣timony

of the Writers of those Times, who posi∣tively assure us, that the <HI>Captain</HI> of the Guards having inform'd the <HI>Emperor</HI> that GOD deny'd nothing to the <HI>Christians,</HI> of whom many were in the <HI>Legion</HI> of <HI>Meletina,</HI> a City of <HI>Capadocia,</HI> and that he ought to try if their Prayers wou'd pro∣cure that Deliverance which he could not otherwise expect: The Emperor ordered they shou'd be called together, and that they all did at the same Time in∣voke the only true <HI>God,</HI> whom the Winds and Storms obey, and who had often deliver'd his Servants by such extraordinary Interposition. <HI>An∣toninus</HI> being too just to stifle the <HI>Miracle,</HI> imme∣diately wrote to the <HI>Senate</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> in Favour of the <HI>Christians,</HI> and ordered their Accusers to be punished with <HI>Death;</HI> a convincing Proof that he tho't <HI>this Assistance</HI> owing to their Prayers. <HI>Tertullian</HI> appeals to these <HI>Letters</HI> within twenty-six Years after, in a solemn <HI>Apology</HI> in Behalf of <HI>Christianity,</HI> which he durst not have done, had not the Thing been past Dispute.—The Additions made to this Story in after Ages, can do no real Prejudice to the <HI>History</HI> itself.

<Q>Take this for certain, there were Men, Women, young Men, old Man, Virgins, old Women, SOLDIERS, and simple Men of all Sorts and Sects of People; whereof some after Stripes and Fire were crowned <HI>Victors,</HI> some after Sword, some others in small Time sufficient∣ly try'd, seemed acceptable Sacrifices to the Lord <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Euseb.

<P><HI>Eusebius</HI> likewise informs us,
<Q>That about the Year of our <HI>Lord</HI> 262, at <HI>Caesarea</HI> in <HI>Palestina,</HI> one <HI>Marinus,</HI> a famous <HI>Soldier</HI> for <HI>Feats</HI> of <HI>Arms,</HI> of noble Lineage and great Substance, was be∣headed for the Testimony of Christ, because he was a <HI>Christian,</HI> and <HI>sacrific'd not</HI> unto the <HI>Empe∣rors.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Farther, <HI>Eusebius</HI> elsewhere observes,
<Q>That after a great <HI>Abuse</HI> of <HI>Liberty,</HI> and much sinful <HI>Con∣tention,</HI> the heavy Hand of God's Judgment, in the <HI>Persecution</HI> rais'd by <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> came upon them, <HI>which, saith he,</HI> took his first <HI>Original</HI> from the <HI>Brethren under Banner in Camp,</HI></Q> And in another Chapter of his Book, speaking of this In∣stance, he saith,
<Q>At the first the Chief <HI>Governor</HI> starting up, as it were out of a profound Drunken∣ness, levell'd at the <HI>Church</HI> privily and obscurely (since the Time which passed after the Reign of <HI>Decius</HI> and <HI>Valerianus</HI>) and waged <HI>Battle</HI> with us, not suddenly, but first assail'd only the CHRISTI∣ANS

which were in CAMP, by this Means he tho't easily to ensnare the rest, if that first he conquered these. And here you might see many of the SOLDIERS desirous to lead a private and solitary Life, fearing they shou'd faint in the Service of Almighty <HI>God;</HI> for when the <HI>Captain</HI> first went about to <HI>persecute</HI> his <HI>Host,</HI> and to try and sift as many as were bro't to him thro'out every Ward, and to give them in Choice, either to obey and enjoy their <HI>Dignity,</HI> or to resist, and on the con∣trary be deprived: Many of the SOLDIERS which were of the KINGDOM of CHRIST, without any Delay or Doubt, preferred the Faith of CHRIST before the Favour and Felicity they seem'd to en∣joy. And one or two of them, very heartily, not only contemned their <HI>Dignities,</HI> but also endured bitter <HI>Death,</HI> for their Constancy in the Service of <HI>God</HI>

<P><Q>The <HI>Soldiers</HI> came as was usual, <HI>crown'd</HI> with <HI>Laurel,</HI> to receive their Share of the <HI>Donation;</HI> and there was one amongst them who appeared with his Head bare, holding his <HI>Crown</HI> in his <HI>Hand;</HI> the rest who were far distant, pointed at him and scoffed, and those who were near, raged with Indignation; the <HI>Tribune</HI> hearing of the <HI>Noise,</HI> ask'd him why he wasn't like the rest?

<P>But in the mean Time acknowledges, that that Soldier had many <HI>Christian Fellow-Soldiers</HI> in the <HI>Army</HI> (Cap. 5).</P>
<P>The aforesaid Particulars, duly considered, do, in my Opinion, plainly prove, that <HI>Tertullian</HI> acknow∣ledged the Lawfulness of <HI>War,</HI> when no sinful <HI>Terms</HI> are impos'd. But to proced.</P>

<P>The next Instance that I would mention is St. <HI>Victor</HI> of <HI>Marseilles;</HI> it is certain, saith <HI>Fleury,</HI>
<Q>That he suffered Martyrdom by Order of the pre∣sent Emperor <HI>Maximian,</HI> and after the <HI>Theban Le∣gion;</HI> he was a <HI>Christian Soldier,</HI> and so zealous, that he went in the Night-time to visit the Faith∣ful, and encourage them to <HI>Martyrdom;</HI> being seized, he was immediately brought before the <HI>Prefects,</HI> who exhorted him not to resign his Ex∣pectations, and the Favour of his <HI>Prince,</HI> for a <HI>dead Man;</HI> such they took <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to be. He answered with Abundance of Freedom, which drew upon him the Looks and Insults of all the Infidels about him; but because he was a Person of Distinction, the Prefects referred him to the <HI>Emperor</HI> himself; and he shewing no less Constan∣cy at his <HI>Tribunal;</HI> the <HI>Emperor</HI> being highly in∣censed, ordered him to be dragged through the Ci∣ty;
<PB N="151" REF="006247_0155_102822286701EA88"/>
whereupon they tied him Hand and Foot, and drag'd him in this Manner, expos'd to the <HI>Blows</HI> and <HI>Insults</HI> of the Populace; which every one tho't they had been criminal if they had not offered. He was then bro't back mangled and bloo∣dy to the <HI>Tribunal</HI> of the <HI>Prefects;</HI> and believing him sufficiently humbled by this Usage, they still pressed him by the Reasons which the Pagans com∣monly made Use of. The <HI>Martyr</HI> on the other Hand, encourag'd by this Beginning of a <HI>Victory,</HI> answered them, exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essing his Fidelity to the <HI>Em∣peror,</HI> and Contempt of their false <HI>Gods.</HI> After which the <HI>Prefects</HI> said to him, <HI>Victor,</HI> will you not leave off Philosophizing? Chuse in one Word, either to appease the <HI>Gods,</HI> or miserably to perish.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Since you have made this Proposal to me, says he, it is necessary that I shou'd confirm my Dis∣course by my Example. I despise your <HI>Gods;</HI> I confess <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> inflict on me all the Tor∣ments you can invent. The <HI>Prefects</HI> being enra∣ged, and one of them being willing to torment him more than the other, they were divided in their Opinion; one of them named <HI>Eutichius</HI> re∣tired, and the Charge of tormenting the <HI>Martyr,</HI> fell upon <HI>Asterius.</HI> He ordered him to be bound, and very cruelly tormented a long Time. The <HI>Martyr</HI> held his Eyes fix'd towards Heaven, pray∣ing for Patience, which was accordingly granted him; <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> appeared to him, holding a Cross in his Hands, and said to him. <HI>Peace be with you Victor; I am Jesus, who suffer in the Persons of my Saints: Be of good Courage, I will assist you in the Combat.</HI> These Words dispersed both his Grief and Torments. Then began he to praise God with a chearful Countenance; and the Executioners being fatigued, and seeing they cou'd prevail nothing with him, the <HI>Prefect</HI> or∣dered

him to be taken from the <HI>Rack,</HI> and put in∣to a very dark <HI>Dungeon.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>At Midnight <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> sent his <HI>Angels</HI> to vi∣sit him; the Prison was open and fill'd with a Light brighter than the Day; and the <HI>Martyr</HI> sung with the <HI>Angels</HI> the <HI>Praises</HI> of God.

<P>Having premised such Considerations as I tho't necessary, to enlighten the labouring Subject; I proceed to consider the particular Instances, that our Author has adduced in Favour of his Senti∣ments. The</P>
<P N="1">1. Of which is <HI>Socrates, V. p.</HI> 9. who is repre∣sented by Mr. <HI>S.</HI> as saying,
<Q>That Injury is to be done upon no Account; nor if you have suffered Injury, are you at Liberty to take Revenge, as the Vulgar believe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I Answer, that what <HI>Socrates</HI> says, is very just and true: Private <HI>Revenge</HI> in <HI>Society,</HI> in ordinary Cases, or repelling Force by Force, is irregular and unjust, as I have before observed; and therefore this Instance is quite beside the Point in Dispute.</P>
<P>Isn't it something strange, that our Author shou'd bring in a Sentence of that eminent <HI>Pagan,</HI> to condemn his known <HI>Practice;</HI> and use the Gen∣tleman's <HI>Magazine</HI> as his Voucher to this Pur∣pose. The</P>
<P N="2">2. Instance that our Author advances, is <HI>Am∣brose,</HI> a Christian <HI>Father, V. p.</HI> 15. who upon these Words of our Saviour, respecting the two Swords that the Disciples spoke of, <HI>It is enough;</HI> saith,
<Q>O Lord, why commandest thou me to buy
<PB N="155" REF="006247_0159_10282238A2CF8B78"/>
a Sword, who forbiddest me to smite with it? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>To which I reply;</P>
<P N="1">1. That even by our Author's Manner of citing <HI>Ambrose</HI>'s Words, the Cause I am defending, is proved by this Sentence,
<Q>Unless perhaps a Defence be prepared;</Q> pray what else is the Design of the <HI>Association,</HI> but the <HI>Defence</HI> of our <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Pro∣perties,</HI> together with due Preparation for it; which the Sermon our <HI>Author</HI> opposes, was calculated to encourage.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mr. <HI>S.</HI> or his <HI>Apologist,</HI> has not cited <HI>Am∣brose</HI>'s Words fairly; which are these,
<Q>Unless perhaps a Defence be prepared, not willingly ne∣cessary, the Law nevertheless does not forbid to strike again <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">—<Q>Cur haberi precipis quod vetas promi, nisi forte ut sit parata defenfio non ultro necessaria, ut videar potuisse vindi∣cari, sed noluisse, lex tamen referrire non vetat; et ideo for∣tasse Petro duos gladios offerenti, sat est dicit, quasi licuerit usque ad evangelium, ut fit in lege, equitatis eruditio in evan∣gelio bonitatis perfectio. <HI>Ambros. Lib.</HI> 7. <HI>in Lucam.</HI></Q></NOTE>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3">3. To take <HI>Ambrose</HI>'s Words in our <HI>Author</HI>'s Sense, as opposing all <HI>War,</HI> makes him contradict himself in the very Passage he cites from him; for therein he owns the Lawfulness of <HI>preparing</HI> for <HI>De∣fence;</HI> 'tis true he says, 'It is not willingly necessa∣ry;' and we join with him heartily, and wou'd be glad there was no Necessity of it; besides, he acknowledges that the Law does not forbid to strike again, and that it is equitable in itself,
<Q>That in the Law there might be learning of Equity.</Q></P>
<P>Besides it makes him contradict himself elsewhere, not only in that Passage I have before cited from him, in which he expresly declares for <HI>Defensive War,</HI> but likewise in this that I shall now mention; his Words are these;
<Q>How great <HI>Justice</HI> is, may be un∣derstood
<PB N="156" REF="006247_0160_1028223A84B90F88"/>
from this, that it is to be excluded from no Places, Persons, or Times; but is to be kept even to Enemies; so that if a <HI>Place</HI> or <HI>Day</HI> is ap∣pointed for <HI>Battle</HI> with an <HI>Enemy,</HI> it is reckoned contrary to <HI>Justice</HI> to come before the <HI>Place</HI> or <HI>Time;</HI> if indeed our Enemies have been more <HI>ve∣hement</HI> and <HI>unfaithful,</HI> and to such as have <HI>hurt</HI> us <HI>more,</HI> a more <HI>vehement Revenge</HI> is returned; as to the <HI>Midianites,</HI> who by their Women, made ma∣ny of the <HI>Jewish</HI> People to sin: It is evident therefore, that even in <HI>War, Faith</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> must be kept <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Quantum autom <HI>justia</HI> sit ex hoc intelligi potest, quod nec locis nec personis, nec temporibus excipitur, quae etiam hostibus reservatur, ut si constitutus sit cum hoste aut lo∣cus aut dies proelio, adversus <HI>justitiam</HI> putaretur, ut loco pre∣venire aut tempore, fiquidem vehementioribus hostibus et infi∣dis et his qui amplius <HI>leserint, vehementior refertur ultio,</HI> ut Midianitis, qui per mulieres suas plerosque peccare fecerant ex plebe <HI>Judaeorum;</HI>—liquet, igitur etiam in bello fidem et justitiam serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re oportere.</Q>

<P>But the chief Difficulty in <HI>Ambrose</HI>'s Words, is in the latter Part of the Paragraph,
<Q>That in the <HI>Law</HI> there might be learning of <HI>Equity,</HI> but in the <HI>Gos∣pel</HI> a <HI>Perfection</HI> of <HI>Goodness.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now the Meaning of <HI>Ambrose</HI> in the aforesaid Sentence, can, in a Consistency with the rest of the Paragraph, and other Passages cited from him, be no other than this, <HI>viz.</HI> Tho' the <HI>Church</HI> under the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation, or <HI>Ministers</HI> of it, us'd a <HI>tem∣poral Sword,</HI> in the Exercise of their <HI>Discipline</HI> upon <HI>Transgressers;</HI> yet that under the <HI>Gospel</HI> the <HI>Officers</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> are to use a <HI>spiritual Sword</HI> only in their <HI>Discipline</HI> upon <HI>Offenders,</HI> for this Reason, because that under the former Dispensation, God's Equity or <HI>Righteousness</HI> was peculiarly display'd; and under the latter, his <HI>Goodness.</HI> Now these
<PB N="157" REF="006247_0161_10282241AAAAAF08"/>
three Things confirm this Interpretation of <HI>Ambrose</HI>'s Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That it agrees with the rest of the Paragraph, and what is cited from him elsewhere.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Words of <HI>Christ,</HI> which he explains by them, were spoken to a <HI>Minister.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="3">3. This was the prevailing Sentiment of the pri∣mitive Church (with which undoubtedly <HI>Ambrose</HI> a∣greed) as I have shewn before; to which I wou'd add these few Words; <HI>Cyprian</HI> saith,
<Q>That God commanded the <HI>Disobedient</HI> to be <HI>slain by the Priests,</HI> whom he constituted Judges for a Time, and then indeed they were kill'd with the <HI>Sword, saith he,</HI>—but now the Proud and Obstinate are slain by the spiritual Sword, while they are cast out of the Church <NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Interfici Deus jussit non obtemperantes a sacerdotibus suis, judicibus a se ad tempus constitutis, et tunc quidem <HI>gla∣dio,</HI> occidebantur,—nunc autem <HI>spirituali gladio</HI> superbi et contumaces aecantur, dum de ecclesia ejiciuntur.</Q>

<P><HI>Augustine</HI> speaks to the same Purpose, as follows;

<P>'Tis Pity that our <HI>Author</HI> shou'd so much wrong that excellent Father <HI>Ambrose,</HI> in misapplying to the Defence of the <HI>State,</HI> what he only spake of the <HI>Dis∣cipline</HI> of the <HI>Church.</HI> The</P>
<P N="3">3d Instance that Mr. <HI>S.</HI> brings, is <HI>Justin Martyr, V. p.</HI> 35. who speaking of this Prophecy. <HI>That Na∣tion
<PB N="158" REF="006247_0162_102822452A631AD0"/>
shall not lift up Sword against Nation, neither shall they learn War any more</HI>—says,
<Q>That this is thus fulfilled, you have Grounds to believe; for we who in Times past kill'd one another, do not war or fight with our Enemies.</Q></P>
<P>To which I answer; It is very true, the Prophecy is fulfill'd in its spiritual Sense (in some Degree) by the peaceable Temper and Behaviour of Christians towards each other, by their Aversion to all Ap∣pearance of <HI>Rebellion</HI> against their rightful <HI>Gover∣nors,</HI> and likewise by their Abhorrence of, and Op∣position to that Abomination, <HI>Offensive War!</HI></P>
<P>That this is <HI>Justin</HI>'s Meaning, appears from the Words which Mr. <HI>S.</HI> has cited from him;
<Q>For we who in Times past kill'd one another, do not war or fight with our Enemies.</Q> And likewise from the following Words of the same Apology (pre∣sented to <HI>Titus Elius Adrianus</HI>) speaking of the Change that the Christian Religion wrought upon them, he saith,
<Q>Formerly we delighted in <HI>De∣bauchery,</HI> but now we love nothing but <HI>Purity</HI>— We <HI>hated</HI> one another; but now since the Coming of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> we live familiarly together, and pray for our Enemies; we endeavour to convert our <HI>Persecutors,</HI> to the End that they may live according to the Precepts of Jesus Christ <NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Fle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry's Eccles. Hist. p. <HI>201.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>To the same Purpose <HI>Ignatius</HI> speaks, in his E∣pistle to the <HI>Ephesians</HI> (which was wrote <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 106) having mentioned their Persecutors, he saith,
<Q>Oppose to their proud Boastings, your Humility; to their Injuries, your Prayers; to their Errors, your Stedfastness in the Faith; to their Brutality, your Courtesy.</Q></P>
<P>Agreeable hereto <HI>Polycarp,</HI> in his Epistle to the <HI>Philippians</HI> (wrote in the Year after Christ 108) saith,
<Q>Pray for <HI>Kings, Princes, Powers,</HI> for those
<PB N="159" REF="006247_0163_10282248F9AA5828"/>
that persecute and hate you, and for the Enemies of the Cross, to the End that the Fruit of your Faith may be manifest to all the World.</Q></P>
<P>But to suppose, with our <HI>Author,</HI> that <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> designed, by the aforesaid Passage, to op∣pose <HI>Defensive War,</HI> is to make him inconsistent with himself; for he, in his second Apology, pre∣sented <HI>A. D.</HI> 150, plainly manifests his Approba∣tion of it, by addressing the <HI>Emperors</HI> in the follow∣ing Manner:
<Q>We earnestly endeavour every where, and before all other Things, saith he, that the <HI>Tri∣bute Money</HI> and Contributions, be brought into those Collectors who are appointed by you, even as we are taught by him (<HI>i. e.</HI> Christ) wherefore we adore God alone, and we gladly serve you in other Things, professing that you are <HI>Emperors</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> of (<HI>i. e.</HI> among) Men; and at the same time praying that, together with your imperial Power, ye may be found by Experience to posess a sound Mind <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Vectigalia et collationes, eis qui a vobis funt ordinati exactoribus, prae omnibus ubique inferre contendimus, quem∣admodum ab eo (<HI>Christo</HI>) sumus instituti. Proinde nos solum Deum adoramus, et vobis in aliis rebus leti inservimus, impe∣ratores ac principes hominum esse profitentes, et simul pre∣cantes, ut cum imperiali potestate, sanam quoque mentem ob∣tinere comperiamini.</Q>
<HI>Justin Martyr in Apolog. secunda.</HI></NOTE>.</Q> Now, does not their Care about the <HI>Tribute-money,</HI> a good part of which was applied to the Maintenance of <HI>Soldiers,</HI> and their Declaration of serving the <HI>Emperors</HI> in other Things, that did not relate to their religious Worship; <HI>i. e.</HI> in all Things of a civil Nature, plainly imply, and evi∣dence the primitive Christians Approbation of a <HI>De∣fensive War?</HI></P>
<P>Besides, our <HI>Author</HI>'s <HI>Gloss</HI> upon <HI>Justin</HI>'s Words, does not only charge Inconsistency upon that vene∣rable Man, but likewise manifold and palpable Weak∣ness, which is very uncharitable!</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="160" REF="006247_0164_1028224D157FA1B0"/>1. In concluding he imagined, that by the peaceable Temper and Behaviour of a few Christians (compa∣ratively) who had then no national Establishment or civil State, either of great or small Dimensions, that the aforesaid <HI>Prophecy,</HI> which speaks of <HI>Nations not lifting up Sword against Nation,</HI> should be fulfilled <HI>literally;</HI> Is a small Number of People, scattered up and down, in various Countries, proceeding from different Nations, and having no Form of civil Go∣vernment among them, a Nation? And,</P>
<P N="2">2. That in an <HI>Apology</HI> designed to vindicate the Christians of that Time, and obtain Favour for them from the <HI>Emperors,</HI> he should offer any Thing that directly tended to stain their Character, and incite the Emperors Resentments against them, of which kind this Notion of rejecting <HI>Defensive War</HI> intirely most certainly is; for what is it in Effect, but to address the <HI>Emperors</HI> in the following Manner?</P>
<P><Q><HI>Dread Sirs,</HI> May it please your <HI>Majesties</HI> to con∣sider, that we <HI>Christians</HI> cannot, in a Consistency with the Principles of our <HI>Religion,</HI> assist you, by bearing <HI>Arms</HI> in Defence of your <HI>Crown</HI> and <HI>Dig∣nity,</HI> in the Defence of your <HI>Empire</HI> against your Enemies, however you may command us notwith∣standing; tho' we have a sincere and strorg Re∣gard to the <HI>Safety</HI> of your <HI>Person</HI> and <HI>Empire,</HI> yet our <HI>Religion</HI> will not suffer us to express it, in the Protection of either, by opposing Force to Force.</Q></P>
<P>Now can we imagine that such a Declaration wou'd be a good Expression of <HI>Loyalty</HI> to their <HI>Prince,</HI> or Regard to their <HI>Country,</HI> or that it wou'd have any Tendency to induce the Pagan <HI>Em∣perors,</HI> to entertain favourable Sentiments of a <HI>Re∣ligion,</HI> that equally oppos'd the clearest Dictates of human <HI>Reason,</HI> and the most valuable Interests of civil <HI>Society,</HI> or to shew any Favour to the Profes∣sors of it? In a Word, as I humbly conceive, the
<PB N="161" REF="006247_0165_1028224EE07989A0"/>
aforesaid Gloss turns <HI>Justin Martyr</HI>'s <HI>Apology</HI> for the Christians into an <HI>Impeachment</HI> of them, and <HI>Invec∣tive</HI> against them: But for my Part, I know no Reason we have to think, that <HI>Justin</HI> was a Man of such a weak Mind, as to offer a <HI>Satyr</HI> instead of a <HI>Panegyrick;</HI> or to act the Part of an <HI>Accuser,</HI> in∣stead of an <HI>Apologist.</HI> But to proceed: The</P>
<P N="4">4th Instance that our <HI>Author</HI> advances, is that of <HI>Athenagoras, V. p.</HI> 42, 43. who in his <HI>Apology</HI> to the <HI>Roman Emperors, M. Aurelius Antoninus,</HI> and <HI>M. Aurelius Commodus,</HI> declares,
<Q>That they made these Words of our Saviour their <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Dog∣ma</HI>'s, namely. <HI>To love their Enemies, bless them that curse you, pray for them that persecute you, &amp;c.</HI> Agreeable hereto he observes, That the Christians of that Day, lov'd their Neighbours, and exercis'd Innocence and Purity of Life, assu∣ring them, that they cou'd suffer no Evil of their Persecutors, tho' it were to the Loss of their Lives, which cou'd be of any Value, when com∣par'd to that exceeding great Reward, which God wou'd give them hereafter.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> This Speech of <HI>Athenagoras,</HI> is very sound and wholesome, and perfectly consistent with our defensive Principles. We bless God we can declare, with the same Truth and Justice as <HI>Athenagoras,</HI> That all who fear God among us, who are for <HI>De∣fensive War,</HI> make the aforesaid golden Words of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> the Rule of our Conduct likewise, whatever our Author imagines to the contrary not∣withstanding; tho' he is pleas'd to put us in the same <HI>Box</HI> as the primitive <HI>Apologists</HI> did the <HI>Pagans.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Here, Reader, saith he, <HI>V. p.</HI> 43. were <HI>Dis∣ciples,</HI> that instead of construing away the greatest Part of the Force of their Master's <HI>Precepts,</HI> took up their <HI>Cross, deny'd themselves,</HI> and faithfully
<PB N="162" REF="006247_0166_1028225515F615E8"/>
practised them.' On which Words, allow me to propose a few Queries.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 1. Is it then the chief Force of Christ's <HI>Precepts</HI> to abstain from <HI>Defensive War?</HI> But where are these Precepts to be found?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 2. Where is the <HI>Self-denial</HI> and <HI>Cross</HI> in be∣ing freed from the <HI>Labour</HI> and <HI>Expence</HI> of preparing for the Defence of our Country?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 3. If the Chief Force of Christ's <HI>Precepts,</HI> the chief Weight of his <HI>Cross,</HI> and of <HI>Self-denial,</HI> consist in being freed as aforesaid from <HI>Charge</HI> and <HI>Fatigue;</HI> then are not the Difficulties of Religion as light as a <HI>Feather,</HI> and very agreeable to the corrupt Inclinations of Nature, which verge to <HI>Money</HI> and <HI>Ease?</HI></P>
<P>In the mean Time, we heartily forgive our Au∣thor's <HI>Invective,</HI> and pray God to pardon his <HI>Uncha∣ritableness</HI> and <HI>Persecution,</HI> and bless him with a found Mind, and all other needful Mercies, for Time and Eternity.</P>
<P>Now inasmuch as the aforesaid Instance of <HI>Athe∣nagoras,</HI> expresly respects <HI>Persecution,</HI> it is quite be∣side the Point in Question, and therefore deserves no more Notice; however, I shall beg leave to add a few Words.</P>
<P><Q>He complains, says Monsieur <HI>Fleury,</HI> to the two <HI>Emperors, Marcus Aurelius,</HI> and <HI>Lucius Ve∣rus,</HI> that the Christians are the only People whom they <HI>persecute,</HI> on Account of their <HI>Name,</HI> whilst all others are permitted to live according to their <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI></Q> <Q>Our <HI>Persecutors,</HI> saith he, are not contented with depriving us of our Goods and Honour, and whatever else the Generality of Mankind look upon as valuable, for we despise it all—But they attack our <HI>Persons</HI> and our <HI>Lives;</HI> —It depends upon you, most great and wise <HI>Prin∣ces,</HI> to defend us by the <HI>Laws</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Fleury's Eccles. Hist. p. <HI>208-9.</HI></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="006247_0167_1028225C28C81810"/>I may add, that <HI>Athenagoras</HI> is so far from being against <HI>Defensive War,</HI> in his Apology, that he vir∣tually and consequentially justifies it; for in his An∣swer to the <HI>Calumny</HI> of eating human Flesh, he saith,
<Q>We are not contented with meer <HI>Justice, in returning like for like;</HI> but we go farther, and propose to ourselves Kindness and Patience. Since we hold these Maxims, can we be call'd <HI>Murderers,</HI> without the greatest Folly?</Q> And speaking to the <HI>Emperors,</HI> he saith, <Q>We are alike in every Thing, being obedient to <HI>Reason,</HI> without pre∣tending to master it <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Apolog. Athenag. p. <HI>38.</HI></NOTE>.</Q> Observe, by the by, that <HI>Athenagoras</HI> was far from our Author's Opini∣on, of judging it to be an Evil in itself, to resist, or to return like for like. For Brevity's sake, I shall offer no more at present upon this Instance, only remember the Reader, that what has been said upon the Instance of <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> is applicable here: And so proceed to the</P>
<P N="5">5th Instance, that our Author is pleas'd to adduce, which is <HI>Tertullian, V. p.</HI> 45. who saith,
<Q>How shall he fight, whose Sword is taken from him by Christ? For tho' the Soldiers came to <HI>John,</HI> and received a Form of Observation, if also the <HI>Cen∣turion</HI> believ'd, yet Christ, by disarming <HI>Peter,</HI> disarm'd every Soldier afterward.</Q></P>
<P>I Answer, that <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s Words, immediately before and after what our Author has cited from him, shew his Meaning, <HI>viz.</HI> That he only op∣pos'd such <HI>Wars</HI> as involved Persons in <HI>Idolatry, &amp;c.</HI> sinful <HI>Swearing,</HI> or at least endangered their Innocence: His Words are these;</P>
<P><Q>Hence, lately there arose a Dispute, whether a <HI>Servant</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> cou'd accept of the Administrati∣on of any Dignity or Power, in Case he cou'd
<PB N="164" REF="006247_0168_1028225DF3ECA210"/>

<P><PB N="165" REF="006247_0169_1028225FB1886B80"/>Upon the aforesaid Words of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> I wou'd observe briefly these few Things; namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. That he puts military and civil Offices upon a Par, and informs us that they were both questi∣on'd at that Time; I mean the Lawfulness of both; and no Wonder, seeing sinful Terms were propos'd, such as <HI>swearing</HI> by <HI>Hercules,</HI> or by the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s <HI>Genius,</HI> which <HI>Tertullian</HI> says in his <HI>Apo∣logy,</HI> was, in Effect, to give divine <HI>Honour</HI> to <HI>De∣vils:</HI> He likewise observes, in the Words I have ci∣ted, that the <HI>Oath</HI> of Fidelity to <HI>God,</HI> and to the Prince, were, under such Circumstances, inconsi∣stent Things. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. He speaks not a Word of the Unlawfulness of <HI>Defensive War,</HI> in its own Nature. And there∣fore,</P>
<P N="3">3. The Words cited by our <HI>Author,</HI> must be taken in a restrained Sense, as signifying Christ's prohibiting our Use of the <HI>Sword,</HI> at such Times when it involves us in <HI>Idolatry,</HI> or endangers our Innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="006247_0170_1028226B633A18D0"/>The Sense our Author puts upon <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s Words, concludes as much against civil as military Offices,; for <HI>Tertullian</HI> speaks of both in the same Series of Discourse, and shews that <HI>swearing</HI> by the Heathen <HI>Gods,</HI> and all Approaches towards <HI>Idola∣try,</HI> were equally unlawful in both: Besides it con∣tradicts what I have before cited from his <HI>Apology,</HI> where he <HI>prays</HI> for the Success of the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s <HI>Troops,</HI> and declares in the Name of the <HI>Christians,</HI> as their <HI>Apologist,</HI> that they <HI>bore Arms;</HI> nor does it agree with the general Scope of the Book upon <HI>Ido∣latry,</HI> out of which it is taken; or with the Passa∣ges that immediately go before, and follow after; all which plainly direct to a limited Sense.</P>
<P>The next Passage from <HI>Tertullian,</HI> that our Au∣thor has advanced, is from his Book against the <HI>Soldier</HI>'s <HI>Crown</HI> (the Occasion of which has been before-mentioned) the Words are these;
<Q>Can a Soldier's Employment be lawful, when Christ has pronounced, That he that uses the Sword, shall perish by the Sword? Can <HI>one who professes the peaceable Doctrine of the Gospel be a Warrior?</HI></Q> The Original Words, truly translated, are, Shall a Son of Peace, be engaged in Battle? <HI>Et prelio ope∣rabitur filius pacis.</HI></P>
<P>I Answer that what goes before, and follows af∣ter the Words our Author has cited, plainly shew, that they are to be taken in a restrained Sense; and that <HI>Tertullian</HI> was not against <HI>Defensive War,</HI> un∣der a proper <HI>Authority,</HI> when it cou'd be carried on without incurring the Guilt of <HI>Idolatry:</HI> For thus he speaks;</P>
<P><Q>Nothing indeed is more unclean than <HI>Idols,</HI> and so the <HI>Crown</HI> is made a Thing sacrificed to <HI>I∣dols,</HI> for truly by this Rite, Habit and Ornament, the Founders thereof did sacrifice to an <HI>Idol;</HI>
<PB N="167" REF="006247_0171_1028226D04CCC280"/>
moreover the Apostle cries aloud, <HI>Fly Idolatry in every Instance of it.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>But that I may enter upon the Case of the <HI>mi∣litary Crown,</HI> I think it proper first to search di∣ligently whether <HI>Warfare</HI> is <HI>wholly suitable</HI> to <HI>Chris∣tians? In Answer to which he says,</HI> 'Do we be∣lieve that it is lawful to put a human open a di∣vine <HI>Sacrament,</HI> and to answer or agree with ano∣ther Lord after Christ, and to except against Fa∣ther and Mother, and every Neighbour, which the Law commands us to honour and love after God—<HI>Then he uses these Words which our Author has cited;</HI> after which he saith, 'Now he must keep <HI>Centry</HI> for others more than for <HI>Christ,</HI> even on the Lord's Day, and watch before the <HI>Temples,</HI> which he has renounced, and <HI>sup</HI> where the Apostle has forbid, and defend those <HI>Demons</HI> in the Night, which he has exorcis'd in the Day—and <HI>burn</HI> according to the Discipline of the Camp, what it is not lawful for a Christian to burn (I suppose he means <HI>Incense</HI> to <HI>Idols</HI>) and how many other Faults are there in the Business of Camps, which are to be call'd Sins.—Certainly if any <HI>believe</HI> after they have engaged in <HI>War,</HI> their Case is different, as of those that <HI>John</HI> admitted to <HI>Baptism,</HI> and the <HI>faithful Centurion,</HI> whom <HI>Christ</HI> approved of: Having undertaken and sign'd, nor should they <HI>de∣sert</HI> immediately, as many do; nor <HI>cavil</HI> every Way, least any Thing be committed against God, which are not permitted by War itself; but lastly, they must suffer for <HI>God,</HI> which even the <HI>Faith</HI> of the <HI>Pagans</HI> equally appoints; nor indeed does the <HI>Warfare</HI> promise the Impunity of Offences, or the Immunity of <HI>Martyrs;</HI> a Christian is ever the same,—For tho' one be pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> by the Necessity of Torments or Punishments, to <HI>sacrifice,</HI> or directly to deny; nevertheless the <HI>Discipline</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI>

<P>Here I would beg leave to observe, that the a∣foresaid
<PB N="169" REF="006247_0173_102822760D108F08"/>
Words of <HI>Tertullian,</HI> expresly prove these Things following; namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Reason why he oppos'd the Soldi∣er's <HI>Crown,</HI> was because he reckon'd it <HI>idolatrous.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That the Kind of <HI>War</HI> which he oppos'd, was such as involv'd Persons in sinful <HI>Oaths</HI> (which he calls <HI>Sacraments</HI>) and other criminal Compliances.</P>
<P N="3">3. That he was so far from being against a law∣ful <HI>War,</HI> that he finds Fault with Persons suddenly <HI>deserting</HI> of it, and <HI>cavilling</HI> against it: And justly observes, That if he rejected <HI>War</HI> altogether, his <HI>Dispute</HI> about the Soldier's <HI>Crown</HI> would be in vain.</P>
<P>He likewise insinuates, that the <HI>Discipline</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> inflicted no <HI>Censure</HI> upon such as behaved inoffensively under that <HI>Character;</HI> who neither <HI>sa∣crificed</HI> nor <HI>deny'd their Redeemer;</HI> and in a Word, he positively declares. <HI>That War is lawful even to the Case of the Soldier's Crown;</HI> which he had be∣fore signified to be <HI>idolatrous; i. e.</HI> in other Words, That it is lawful for <HI>Christians</HI> to carry on <HI>War,</HI> if <HI>idolatrous Terms</HI> be not impos'd; now what can be plainer than this. Well, shall we believe our <HI>Au∣thor</HI> or <HI>Tertullian</HI> himself? Let the Reader Judge. But I hasten to the</P>
<P N="6">6th Instance that Mr. <HI>S.</HI> brings, which is <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus, V. p.</HI> 49. who saith,
<Q>Neither are the Faces of Idols to be painted, which so much as to regard, is forbidden; neither Sword nor Bow to them that follow Peace.</Q></P>
<P>I Answer, that I have before proved <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> to be for <HI>War,</HI> to which I refer the Reader; and therefore think it needless to add here, unless it be just this, That the Words our Author has cited, are so general and indefinite, that they prove nothing, unless it be this from their Connecti∣on, that the primitive Christians were against paint∣ing
<PB N="170" REF="006247_0174_1028227C0FCC1528"/>
<HI>Swords</HI> or <HI>Bows,</HI> which I think is beside the Question in debate.</P>
<P>In the 35th <HI>Canon</HI> of the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Elvira</HI> in <HI>Spain, A. D.</HI> 300, all <HI>Painting</HI> in <HI>Churches</HI> was prohibited, lest that which was painted on <HI>Walls,</HI> should be worshipped; to this probably the Words of <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> relate; who, as Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> informs us, flourish'd at this Time, <HI>Fleu∣ry</HI>'s <HI>Eccles. Hist. Book</HI> 9. <HI>p.</HI> 173.</P>
<P>As to what our <HI>Author</HI> cites (from <HI>Barc. Apol.</HI>) of <HI>Tertullian</HI> against <HI>Marcion,</HI> viz.
<Q>That <HI>Christ</HI> teacheth a new Patience, even forbidding the re∣venging an <HI>Injury,</HI> which was permitted by the Creator; and <HI>Lib. de patien.</HI> That the Law finds more than it lost, by <HI>Christ</HI>'s saying. <HI>Love your Enemies. V. p.</HI> 44.</Q></P>
<P>I Answer, that the Design of the aforesaid <HI>Book,</HI> is to vindicate the <HI>Law</HI> against the Objections of <HI>Marcion.</HI> Accordingly <HI>Tertullian</HI> says in it,
<Q>That <HI>Justice</HI> is necessary to suppress <HI>Evil</HI>—If <HI>Injustice</HI> be <HI>evil, Justice</HI> must necessarily be <HI>good,</HI> and con∣sequently all the Effects of it, as <HI>Severity, Anger</HI> and <HI>Jealousy</HI>—The <HI>Justice</HI> of God is prior to that <HI>Severity</HI> which Sin occasioned; Punishment is an Evil in respect of him that suffers, insomuch as it torments him; but good, inasmuch as he is thereby corrected; and good absolutely, in re∣spect to him who justly appoints it. <HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>C.</HI> 2, 12, 13, 14, 16, 26. He observes that the <HI>Pro∣phets</HI> taught these <HI>Maxims, Take away all Malice from your Heart, learn to do well.</HI>—He likewise asserts, that the <HI>Law</HI> taught <HI>Charity</HI> and pardon∣ing of Injuries. <HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>C.</HI> 19. <HI>Lib.</HI> 4. <HI>C.</HI> 16.</Q></P>
<P>From what has been said, it is evident, that <HI>Ter∣tullian</HI> can consistently mean no more, by the afore∣said Passages, than this, That the <HI>Gospel</HI> forbids private <HI>Revenge,</HI> and recommends <HI>Patience</HI> and
<PB N="171" REF="006247_0175_1028227F9CA8F1D0"/>
<HI>Love</HI> by new Arguments, all which are exceeding agreeable to <HI>Defensive War.</HI> The</P>
<P N="7">7th Instance our <HI>Author</HI> brings, is of the <HI>Emperor M. Aurelius Antoninus, V. p.</HI> 49. who says,
<Q>I <HI>pray'd</HI> to my <HI>Country Gods,</HI> but when I was ne∣glected by them, and observed myself pressed by the Enemy, considering the Fewness of my For∣ces,—I entreated those that are called <HI>Christians,</HI> and I forced them with Threats, therefore they betook themselves neither to the Use of Darts, nor Trumpets, for they use not so to do, for the Cause and Name of their God, which they bear in their Consciences.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans,</HI> If I am not mistaken, our <HI>Author</HI> has been so kind as to furnish us with an honourable <HI>Testimo∣ny</HI> for <HI>Defensive War;</HI> the Substance of his Citation seems to be this, That there was a great Number of Christian <HI>Soldiers</HI> in the <HI>Emperor Antoninus</HI>'s <HI>Army,</HI> who were so faithful to the true God, that when the <HI>Emperor</HI> went about that <HI>idolatrous</HI> wicked Work of praying to his false <HI>Gods,</HI> neglected or left him, and that very justly, and when he wou'd force them to the same evil Practice, they nobly laid down their <HI>Arms</HI> (as many did for the same Reason in those primitive Times) from a Regard they had to the Name and Cause of their God; a noble Ex∣ample indeed, well worthy of our Imitation: What I have before mentioned from <HI>Austin,</HI> concerning the usual Practice of the primitive Christian <HI>Soldiers,</HI> gives farther Light and Force to what has been now observed. The</P>
<P N="8">8th Instance our <HI>Author</HI> is pleas'd to advance, is the Words of <HI>Martin</HI> to <HI>Julian,</HI> as related by <HI>Sul∣pitius Severus,</HI> which he says are very full and posi∣tive;
<Q>I am a Soldier of <HI>Christ,</HI> therefore I cannot <HI>fight.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="006247_0176_1028228162DD8598"/><HI>Ans.</HI> Our <HI>Author</HI> hasn't told us in this, and some other Instances, where to find the Words he cites, which puts no little Difficulty upon the Re∣spondent.</P>
<P>However I hope Mr. <HI>S.</HI> will excuse me, in sig∣nifying, that I cannot be of his Opinion about this Instance, which he thinks is full and positive; to my Apprehension, it proves nothing at all to his Pur∣pose, if these Things following be considered, which are mentioned by <HI>Sulpitius Severus;</HI> namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. That he bore <HI>Arms</HI> in his Youth, both under <HI>Constantine</HI> and <HI>Julius Cesar</HI>—three Years before his Baptism—and almost two Years after it.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Reason why he quitted the <HI>military Business,</HI> was not that he judged it sinful in itself, of which there is not a Word in his whole Life; but because from his Infancy he rather
<Q>breathed after a divine Service;—when he was twelve Years old, he desired a desart or solitary Life, and had made a <HI>Vow</HI> to this Purpose; and hence he undertook the Life of a <HI>Soldier</HI> at first unwillingly,—and so embraced the first Opportunity that presented of quitting it; which was this, while the <HI>Barbarians</HI> invaded <HI>France.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q><HI>Julius Cesar</HI> having gathered together his <HI>Army</HI> near a City in <HI>Germany,</HI> began to give a <HI>Donative</HI> to his <HI>Soldiers</HI> according to Custom, for which End they were all summoned till it came to <HI>Martin</HI>'s Turn; who, judging it a proper <HI>Season</HI> in which he might ask a <HI>Dismission,</HI> nor did he think it right for him to receive the <HI>Donative,</HI> seeing he did not purpose to continue in the <HI>military Service;</HI> he said to the <HI>Emperor,</HI> Hitherto I have warred for you, suffer me now to war for God; let him that is to continue in the War receive your <HI>Gift;</HI> I am a Soldier of Christ, it is not permitted me to fight.

<HI>Hilary,</HI> the <HI>Bishop</HI> of the <HI>City:</HI> So that <HI>Martin</HI>'s Meaning, in the Words aforesaid, is no more than this, that his continuing in the martial Business, was inconsistent with his Purpose and Vow to de∣vote himself to the solitary Life of a <HI>Monk</HI> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Ipse <HI>armatam militiam</HI> in adolescentia secutus, sub <HI>rege Constantino,</HI> deinde sub <HI>Juliano Caesare militavit.</HI> Non tamen sponte: quia a primis fere annis divina potius servitute spiravit.

but in the aforesaid Words he approves of others continuing in the War.</P>
<P>The ninth Instance produced is <HI>Origen</HI> against <HI>Celsus, V. p.</HI> 50, 51, the Substance of which is,
<Q>That they assisted the <HI>Emperor</HI> in his just Engage∣ments, by their <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Prayers,</HI> more than o∣thers by <HI>Fighting;</HI> but that they could not bear <HI>Arms</HI> under him, tho' he compelled them to it.</Q></P>
<P>I answer, that <HI>Origen</HI> does not introduce the Dis∣course of <HI>Celsus</HI> upon this Head, by way of <HI>Objec∣tion</HI> against the Christians of that Day, but by way of <HI>Entreaty</HI> to them;
<Q>Finally (saith he) <HI>Celsus</HI> entreats us to help the <HI>Emperor</HI> with all our Strength, and to carry on just and pious <HI>Wars</HI> un∣der his <HI>Divination</HI> or <HI>Conduct</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Postremo hortatur nos Celsus, ut opem feramus impe∣ratori totis viribus, ut geramus ejus auspiciis, justa piaque bel∣la.</Q></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="006247_0178_1028228CF00B7040"/>Farther, another Passage in this Speech of <HI>Ori∣gen</HI>'s, is not translated in our Author's <HI>Citation</HI> with its full <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Energy:</HI> The Words are these:
<Q>We wrestle in Prayer with God for the lawful <HI>Em∣peror,</HI> and for the <HI>Soldier</HI> that carries on a pious and just War <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Decertantium autem fusis ad Deum precibus, pro le∣gitimo imperatore; et pium justumques bellum gerente milite.</Q></NOTE>.</Q>
Observe, <HI>Reader,</HI> here are two Arguments of <HI>Origen</HI>'s Opinion in favour of defen∣sive War, <HI>viz.</HI> 1st, He acknowledges it to be <HI>pious</HI> and <HI>just:</HI> And 2d, <HI>Prays heartily</HI> for the <HI>Success</HI> of <HI>Soldiers</HI> engaged in it.

<P>The <HI>Reason</HI> why some declined these Offices, <HI>Ori∣gen</HI> expresses in the following Manner:
<Q>Nor do the <HI>Christians</HI> this, says he, because they <HI>fled</HI> away from the publick <HI>Offices</HI> of Life, but because they keep themselves for <HI>more Divine</HI> and <HI>more necessary Offi∣ces</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> in order to promote the Salva∣tion of Men <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><Q>Nec hoc faciunt Christiani, quod ista publica vitae mu∣nia refugiant; sed quod se servent <HI>divinioribus</HI> et <HI>magis neces∣sariis muniis ecclesiae,</HI> ad salutem hominum.</Q></NOTE>.</Q>
Observe, <HI>Reader,</HI> that <HI>Origen</HI> here acknowledges also the <HI>Divine Original,</HI> and <HI>Ne∣cessity</HI> of <HI>warlike Offices;</HI> for of these he had been speaking before:

<P>And in another Part of the same Treatise against <HI>Celsus,</HI> he says,
<Q>That the Doctrine of Christianity was so far from <HI>Sedition,</HI> that the <HI>Lawgiver</HI> of the Christians has prohibited them from committing any Sort of <HI>Murder,</HI>—even against the most wic∣ked of Mankind.

Here <HI>Origen</HI> expresly ac∣knowledges the Necessity of <HI>War,</HI> by <HI>States</HI> or <HI>Bodies politick,</HI> for the Defence of <HI>Civil Govern∣ment,</HI> which is the labouring Point; and excuses the Backwardness of some Christians from engaging in it, partly because they were no State, and there∣fore had no Laws of their own to defend, and partly because they were <HI>persecuted</HI> by those in the Govern∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="006247_0180_102822919293FF28"/>And elsewhere he saith,

But I hasten to the</P>
<P N="10">10th Instance, namely, of <HI>Marcellus,</HI> the Cen∣turion, <HI>V. p.</HI> 51.
<Q>who (as <HI>Ruinart</HI> Informs us) went and laid down his Arms before the Ensign of the <HI>Legion,</HI> and having thrown away his military <HI>Belt,</HI> declared, before all the <HI>Soldiers,</HI> that he was a Christian; for which he was put to Death.</Q></P>
<P>I would beg Leave to answer this <HI>Objection</HI> in the Words of Monsieur <HI>Fleury,</HI> who says as fol∣lows;</P>
<P><Q>It, was in the Year 298, under the Consulship of <HI>Faustus</HI> and <HI>Gallus,</HI> that the Christian <HI>Soldiers</HI> began to be persecuted by <HI>Veturius,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Militia.</HI> We may also fix the Date of for∣ty Christian <HI>Soldiers,</HI> at the same Period of Time; who suffered great <HI>Torments</HI> at <HI>Lauriac</HI> in <HI>Norica,</HI> a City that is now ruined, seated on the River <HI>Ens,</HI> near the Place where it runs into the <HI>Danube:</HI> They were joined by <HI>Florian</HI> their Fellow-<HI>Soldier,</HI> whom the <HI>Prefect</HI> or Lieutenant <HI>Aquilinus</HI> com∣manded to be beaten with <HI>Clubs,</HI> and afterwards to be thrown into the River <HI>Ens.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>At <HI>Tingi,</HI> or <HI>Tanger,</HI> in <HI>Mauritania,</HI> near the Streights, while every one was employed in feasting and Sacrifices, it being the Emperor's Birth-day, <HI>Marcellus</HI> a <HI>Centurion,</HI> in the <HI>Legion</HI> of <HI>Trajan,</HI> looking upon those <HI>Feasts</HI> as <HI>prophane,</HI> took off
<PB N="177" REF="006247_0181_10282294D1FD06B8"/>
his <HI>military Belt</HI> before, the whole <HI>Legion,</HI> and cry'd aloud, I am the <HI>Soldier</HI> of JESUS CHRIST, the eternal <HI>King.</HI> He immediately threw down his <HI>Vine Branch</HI> and his <HI>Arms,</HI> and added, I will not fight any longer under the <HI>Banners</HI> of your <HI>Emperors,</HI> or serve your <HI>Gods</HI> of <HI>Wood</HI> and <HI>Stone,</HI> that are deaf and dumb <HI>Idols.</HI> If the <HI>Condition</HI> of a <HI>Soldier</HI> is such, that he is obliged to <HI>sacrifice</HI> to <HI>Gods</HI> and <HI>Emperors,</HI> I abandon the Vine <HI>Branch,</HI> and the <HI>Belt,</HI> and quit the <HI>Service.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>We plainly see, saith <HI>Fleury,</HI> the <HI>Cause</HI> that forc'd the Christians to <HI>desert,</HI> viz. Their being oblig'd to partake in their <HI>idolatrous Worship.</HI> We are to observe (saith he) that the <HI>Belt</HI> where the Sword hung, was the Characteristick of a pri∣vate Soldier, and the <HI>Vine-Branch</HI> that of a <HI>Cen∣turion;</HI> for they employ'd them in beating the <HI>Soldiers,</HI> and never struck them with any Thing else.—For this being sent under a strong Guard to <HI>Mauritania Tingitan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> he was bro't before <HI>Au∣relian Agricolaus,</HI> and was accused by an Officer, as follows; <HI>Anastatius Fortunatus,</HI> President of the <HI>Legion,</HI> sends to you <HI>Marcellus</HI> the <HI>Centurion,</HI> who now stands before you; I have here the Let∣ter which he hath written to you upon that Subject, which I will read if you command it. <HI>Agricolaus</HI> reply'd, let it be read; whereupon an Officer said, This <HI>Soldier</HI> hath thrown away his military <HI>Belt,</HI> has own'd himself a <HI>Christian,</HI> and has uttered se∣veral blasphemous Expressions against the <HI>Gods,</HI> and <HI>Caesar,</HI> before all the People, which is the Rea∣son of his being sent to you, that you may direct what shall be done with him. When the Letter was read, <HI>Agricolaus</HI> said, Did you, <HI>Marcellus,</HI> speak these Words before the <HI>President?</HI> To whom <HI>Mar∣cellus</HI> reply'd, that he had spoken them. <HI>Agricolaus</HI>
<PB N="178" REF="006247_0182_1028229949E07910"/>
said, Was you a common <HI>Centurion? Marcellus</HI> an∣swered him, that he had been so. <HI>Agricolaus</HI> said, What Fury cou'd inspire you to throw away the <HI>Tokens</HI> of your <HI>Oath,</HI> and to utter such Expressi∣ons? <HI>Marcellus</HI> answer'd, Those who <HI>fear God</HI> are not inspir'd with Fury. Then <HI>Agricolaus</HI> said, did you repeat all those Words that are mentioned in the Acts of the <HI>President?</HI> To which <HI>Marcellus</HI> answered in the affirmative. <HI>Agricolaus</HI> continued, Did you throw down your Arms? <HI>Marcellus</HI> re∣ply'd, I did; and that because a <HI>Christian,</HI> who is a Servant of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> cannot fight, for the <HI>Dis∣orders</HI> of this <HI>World.</HI>—Upon which <HI>Agricolaus</HI> or∣dered him to be put to Death, in consequence of which he was beheaded: Thus he died laying down his Life for the Sake of Jesus Christ. <HI>Cassianus,</HI> the <HI>Register,</HI> who wrote the Sentence, seeing the In∣trepidity of <HI>Marcellus,</HI> cry'd out aloud that he was shock'd with that Sentence, and immediately threw down his <HI>Wax Tables,</HI> and the <HI>Stile</HI> or Pin with which he wrote: All the <HI>Officers</HI> were in great Con∣sternation; but <HI>Marcellus</HI> smiled; the <HI>Judge</HI> rose from his <HI>Seat,</HI> in a great Passion, and ask'd him, why he had thrown away the <HI>Tables</HI> with so disdain∣ful an Air? Because, saith <HI>Cassianus,</HI> you have pro∣nounc'd an unjust Sentence; upon which he imme∣diately commanded him to be seiz'd, and cast into <HI>Prison. Cassianus</HI> likewise some Time after obtain'd the Crown of <HI>Martyrdom</HI> <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot">Vid. Fleury's Eccles. Hist. p. <HI>503-4-5.</HI> Edit. Londin. <HI>1727.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
I proceed to the</P>
<P N="11">11th And last Instance that our <HI>Author</HI> advances, which is <HI>Maximilian.</HI> This he is pleas'd to intro∣duce with a very confident Air, as if it was an im∣pregnable <HI>Bulwark</HI> to his <HI>Cause,</HI> by saying,
<Q>And
<PB N="179" REF="006247_0183_102821262C9F7A28"/>
farther to prove beyond all Contradiction, that it was held unlawful for a Christian to bear Arms and to fight, not only in the Days of <HI>Tertullian</HI> and <HI>Origen,</HI> but later down, even to the <HI>Emperor Dioclesian</HI>'s Time: I shall produce the Testimony of one <HI>Maximilian,</HI> who suffer'd Death under that <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Reign, for refusing to bear Arms. He frequently told the <HI>Proconsul, Dion,</HI> that he must not fight because he was a Christian.</Q>
See <HI>V. p.</HI> 51, 52, 53, 54.</P>
<P>I answer, that this Instance, tho' plausible and po∣pular, hath nevertheless, in my Opinion, no Force at all in it, to prove the Point our Author brought it for, if it be considered,</P>
<P N="1">1st. That <HI>Dioclesian</HI> being enraged at the Pre∣sence of some Christians at their <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> and hind∣ring their <HI>Divination,</HI>
<Q>Had, as <HI>Fleury</HI> observes, <HI>commanded</HI> in a Rage, that not only they who were present at the <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> but likewise all that were in the <HI>Palace,</HI> shou'd be compelled to sacrifice to the Gods, and such as refus'd should be <HI>scourg'd</HI> with <HI>Whips;</HI> he wrote also to the <HI>Officers</HI> of his <HI>Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,</HI> to constrain all the <HI>Soldiers</HI> under his <HI>Command</HI> to sacrifice to the <HI>Gods.</HI>—By this Means many volun∣tarily resign'd their Commands, rather than re∣nounce their God. Thus the Persecution began, first with those that were in the <HI>Army,</HI> afterward, upon this Answer of <HI>Maximilian, It is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me to bear Arms, because I am a Christian;</HI> Mon∣sieur <HI>Fleury</HI> observes, Now it was not the Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣on of <HI>Arms,</HI> that the Christians particularly rejected, but the <HI>Idolatry</HI> that was inseparable from it, and the <HI>Orders Dioclesian</HI> had given, as may be seen in other publick Acts <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot">Fleury's Eccles. Hist. p. <HI>500-1.</HI> Euseb. Lib. <HI>8.</HI> Cap. <HI>4.</HI> Veget. Lib. <HI>5.</HI> Cap. <HI>5.8.</HI></NOTE>.—The <HI>Proconsul</HI> having
<PB N="180" REF="006247_0184_1028229E5117F618"/>
press'd <HI>Maximilian</HI> several Times, says, in the Ar∣my of our Masters, there are <HI>Christian Soldiers</HI> who do Duty. <HI>Maximilian</HI> answers, They know what they have to do; but as for my Part, I am a Chri∣stian, and dare not do Ill. What Ill do they do, says the <HI>Proconsul,</HI> who serve in the <HI>Army? Max∣imilian</HI> says. You know what they do! Here we may observe, says Monsieur <HI>Fleury,</HI> that the Chri∣stians refus'd not military Service as an Evil in it∣self, but because it was the Occasion of Sinning, under <HI>Pagan</HI> Emperors.</Q>
Of this Kind I have mentioned many Instances in the preceding Pages, and a famous one just before this.</P>
<P N="2">2. By our <HI>Author</HI>'s Way of Reasoning in this In∣stance of <HI>Maximilian,</HI> I may prove with equal Force, that the <HI>Jews</HI> are against War and Fighting, judg∣ing it to be an Evil contrary to their <HI>Religion E. G.</HI> In <HI>Dolabella</HI>'s Letter to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> extant in <HI>Jo∣sephus,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> desired to be exempted from all <HI>military Expeditions. Alexander</HI> the Son of <HI>Theodore,</HI> being deputed from <HI>Hircanus,</HI> the <HI>High-priest</HI> and <HI>Prince</HI> of the <HI>Jewish Nation,</HI> declared, That his Countrymen cou'd not engage in the <HI>Army,</HI> or bear <HI>Arms,</HI> on Account of observing the Rites of their own Law <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Jud. Lib. <HI>14.</HI> Cap. <HI>17.</HI> p. <HI>448.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The same Historian likewise informs us, that for this Reason the <HI>Jews</HI> got Leave of <HI>Lentulus</HI> to be discharged <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot">Antiq. Jud. Lib. <HI>14.</HI> Cap. <HI>17.</HI> p. <HI>448.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>And in another Place he informs us, that when the <HI>Jews</HI> were commanded to depart from the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> some listed themselves <HI>Soldiers,</HI> others were punished for refusing to do it, in Reverence
<PB N="181" REF="006247_0185_102822A151B9D398"/>
to the <HI>Laws</HI> of their <HI>Country.</HI> Now to use our <HI>Au∣thor</HI>'s Words, Do these prove beyond all Contra∣diction, that it was held unlawful for a <HI>Jew</HI> to bear <HI>Arms</HI> and to <HI>fight</HI> in these Days? Is this solid Rea∣soning? Has it any Thing besides <HI>Sound</HI> and <HI>Ap∣pearance?</HI> But,</P>
<P N="3">3. Even in this Instance of <HI>Maximilian,</HI> we have the <HI>Proconsul Dion</HI>'s Testimony in our Favour, That among the Life-guards of <HI>Maximianus, Dio∣clesian, Constantius,</HI> and <HI>Maximus,</HI> there were <HI>Chris∣tian Soldiers</HI> who <HI>fought.</HI> And here I cannot but observe, that our Author's <HI>Reflections</HI> upon <HI>Maxi∣milian</HI>'s charitable Speech respecting the <HI>Soldiers</HI> that then bore <HI>Arms,</HI>
<Q>They know what is expedient for them,' are as inconsistent as uncharitable; for first he commends it, by saying, 'This is truly the very Language of a <HI>Disciple</HI> of <HI>Christ;</HI>' and afterwards opposes it in these Words, 'But what Sort of <HI>Christians</HI> those were, that <HI>Dion</HI> spoke of, that cou'd <HI>fight,</HI> we can only guess at; they might in∣deed bear the <HI>Name</HI> of <HI>Christians,</HI> as <HI>Multitudes do Now-a-days.</HI></Q>—Here give me Leave to propose a few Queries. <HI>Query</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. If our Author didn't like <HI>Maximilian</HI>'s chari∣table Example, why did he commend it?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 2. After he had commended it, why did he so directly contradict it, by condemning the <HI>States</HI> of those <HI>Soldiers,</HI> which their Cotemporary <HI>Maximilian</HI> wou'dn't meddle with? And likewise by condemning the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Multitudes</HI> now, for the same Reason, <HI>viz. Fighting,</HI> or <HI>bearing Arms;</HI> for he represents both as Christians in <HI>Name</HI> only: 'Tis true he softens it a little by the following Words; but this doesn't wholly remove his censo∣rious <HI>Invective.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 3. Whether <HI>Uncharitableness</HI> be a good
<PB N="182" REF="006247_0186_102822A9265D4230"/>
Sign of a <HI>peaceable Temper,</HI> and of great Attain∣ments in Spirituality?</P>
<P><HI>Query</HI> 4. Was it not a <HI>Blot</HI> in <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s <HI>Es∣cutcheon,</HI> that when he fell into the <HI>Errors</HI> of <HI>Monta∣nus,</HI> he had no Charity for any but his enthusiastical Followers; and therefore wrote against the Catho∣lick Church, under the Character of natural or graceless Persons?</P>
<P>I must freely declare, that upon a farther <HI>Inquiry</HI> into the <HI>Subject</HI> of this <HI>Debate,</HI> occasion'd by Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Annimadversions, I am more confirm'd in my <HI>Opinion</HI> than before; and cannot find any Thing in <HI>Scripture, Reason,</HI> or <HI>Antiquity,</HI> to coun∣tenance the contrary.</P>
<P>It is true divers <HI>Christians</HI> of a private <HI>Character</HI> declin'd <HI>War</HI> in the primitive Times; but this is no Wonder at all, considering the <HI>idolatrous Terms</HI> im∣pos'd upon <HI>Soldiers</HI> by the Pagan <HI>Emperors;</HI> nor is it any Prejudice in the least Degree to the Cause I defend.</P>
<P>Yet I know of none of any Note in the Christian Church, for the Space of Fifteen Hundred Years after <HI>Christ,</HI> that was of our <HI>Author</HI>'s <HI>Opinion, viz.</HI> That <HI>War</HI> of every Kind is in itself a great <HI>Evil;</HI> yea, as much greater than private <HI>Revenge,</HI> as a <HI>Camel</HI> is to a <HI>Gnat.</HI> See <HI>V. p.</HI> 39, 40. and else∣where.</P>
<P>But supposing some few might be found, of a singular and whimsical <HI>Cast</HI> of <HI>Mind,</HI> and perhaps <HI>Self-contradictory,</HI> who were of our <HI>Author</HI>'s <HI>Opini∣on;</HI> can these turn the <HI>Stream</HI> of <HI>Antiquity</HI> retro∣grade, or disannul the <HI>Judgment</HI> of the <HI>Body</HI> of the Christian <HI>Church?</HI> No, by no Means!</P>
<P>And now to use Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Words, may I not say, that I have gone thro' the Arguments us'd in his <HI>Vindication,</HI> to prove the <HI>Unlawfulness</HI> of <HI>War?</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="006247_0187_102822AAAEB5D708" MS="y"/>
I think I have not omitted any that are material, nor I hope done any Injustice to them; I have ex∣press'd my Tho'ts why they are not sufficient for the Purpose for which they were intended: And shall take my Leave of this <HI>Writer,</HI> by observing with the <HI>Apostle, And now abideth Faith, Hope, and Charity; but the greatest of these is</HI> CHARI∣TY.</P>
