<HEAD>The Unreasonable Outcrys, against Regular Singing Silenc'd.</HEAD>
<Q><BIBL>ACTS 17.6.</BIBL>
<P>—<HI>These that have turned the World upside down, are come hither also.</HI></P></Q>
<P>THEY that first set up, as the Spreaders of the Gospel, and to give their testimony to <HI>Christ</HI> and his Doctrine, had seen little beside Boats and Men: a few illiterate <HI>Fishermen</HI> with a <HI>Publican</HI> and <HI>Tent maker;</HI> a strange under∣taking, for such unaccomplished Orators, to try to con∣vert the World to <HI>Christ,</HI> and to subject the powerful, learned and wise, to the foot of a crucified Person! but they forgot not Christ's parting Promise, Mat. 28.20. <HI>Go ye therefore &amp; teach all nations; — and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.</HI> And fail∣ed not to lean on <HI>Divine Aids and Assistance;</HI> which brought the matter on to a wonderful Persection, in a lit∣tle time; tho' they met with not only cold entertain∣ment: but damping repulse, and harsh treatment, when they first preached Christ, to an ignorant, depraved, athe∣istical and infidel World; as the Text intimates; which sets forth, the bitter charge lay'd upon <HI>Paul &amp; Silas,</HI> for only Scripture reasoning concerning Christ, and his Resur∣rection. The charge lay'd upon them, by the implacable outragious <HI>Jews,</HI> was, as if they went about only upon a seditious Design, &amp; as <HI>State troublers;</HI> when they sought <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> worse thing, than to persuade the <HI>Thessalonians,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="002627_0003_0FDB80233AB42708"/>(where the preaching now was) <HI>to turn from dumb idols to serve the living God.</HI> The <HI>Rabble</HI> counted it very criminal, for <HI>Jason</HI> their <HI>Host</HI> to harbour them, and took Bail belike of him for their appearance, when they should be call'd for to Examination.</P>
<P>The Words may be consider'd as a bitter, causeless Charge. Where observe,</P>
<P N="1">1.<HI>The Persons charged; Paul, &amp; Silas his Colleague,</HI> that were out upon no other but the Gospel design.</P>
<P N="2">2.Observe <HI>the matter of the Charge;</HI> viz. <HI>that they</HI> (and their followers) <HI>had turned the world upside down.</HI> A proverbial say, but high charge! and their meaning probably was that they stirred up the world to Insurrecti∣on and Sedition, a grievous Charge! — But the com∣fort was, (to speak on the Apostles side) it was utterly false, (like that of <HI>Tertullus</HI> against <HI>Paul,</HI> Acts 24 5. says he, <HI>We have found this man a pestilent fellow, &amp; a mo∣ver of sedition,</HI> &amp;c. For all the <HI>Jews</HI> were so ready to confirm his lie, v.9 <HI>The Jews also assented, saying, that those things were so</HI>) In a good sense, it were well if the charge in the Text had been true, for the depraved world wanted then, (and never more perhaps) to be turned clean out of their idolatrous, vicious Customs; and to be brought to the Faith and Purity of the Gospel. But these (the only Tumult and Uproar-makers of that Day;) continue the Charge, <HI>v.</HI> 7. for that they brought in <HI>Customs contrary to</HI> Caesar'<HI>s.</HI> Whereas, these Servants of God, try'd to advance the spiritual Kingdom of Christ, without the least Injury <HI>to the Roman Empire:</HI> that the <HI>Jews</HI> knew to be so in their Consciences; but cast the wic∣ked Aspersion on them, to make them odious to the peo∣ple; and pretended regard <HI>to</HI> Caesar'<HI>s Decrees,</HI> only to ruin Christ's <HI>Servants,</HI> and hinder the Gospel: whereas the <HI>traduced persons,</HI> honoured the <HI>Emperor,</HI> pray'd for his Life, for a prosperous Reign, and valiant Armies; a faithful <HI>Senate,</HI> discreet Counsel, a good People, and a quiet World. For this they taught, Tit. 3.1. <HI>Put 'em in mind to be subject to principalities, &amp; powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work</HI> &amp;c. And
<PB N="4" REF="002627_0004_0FDB8027F13A8A00"/>Yet was the world (at that time all gone to naught;) set to misrepute them, and the whole Gospel design, viz. to advance a divine Knowledge and Purity, with Reformation of Life.</P>
<P N="3">3. Observe, a farther Aggravation insisted on, <HI>are come hither also.</HI> O Nesandous! It was bad eno' to go to o∣ther places, and spread their leaven, but quite unpardona∣ble to go near the Chargers. Thus they proceed in Accu∣mulation against the Servants of God, till out of breath: for men will be as violent in a bad cause sometimes, viz. when mispersuaded, as others are in a good one. All that I shall observe to you from the words is this. viz.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>That the Gospel itself, when first advanced in the World, and the first Preachers of it, had a formida∣ble Outcry raised upon them.</HI></Q>
<P>The Malignant world, did not know how to speak bad eno', and contemptuously eno' hereof they tho't. What scorn and hard frumps had <HI>Paul</HI> and his Doctrine from the <HI>Athenian Philosophers?</HI> v.18. <HI>Some said what will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter Forth of strange gods,</HI> &amp;c. The Apostles offered nothing more harsh to Reason, than convincing proofs, <HI>that Christ was the appointed, and expected Messiah to come &amp; save the world; and irrefragable Confirmations of the truth of his Resurrection, that mon might be persuaded, they had a living Saviour to trust in;</HI> and that they might quit the vices spoken of in Rom. 1.30.1 Cor. 6.10. Tit. 3.3. Gal. 5.21.2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.2. <HI>And get washed, sanctified, justified,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And appear with the spirit of love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, temperance and the like, as a proof that they had closed with the Saviour of the world, as their Head and Saviour.</HI> And could this hurt any, need it to have disturbed any! Yet harsh and very unwelcome treatment, had the Gospel and the first Preachers of it, when Christ
<PB N="5" REF="002627_0005_0FDB8029F4BF72D0"/>any more instance of this thing, it is but turning back to what the <HI>Apostles,</HI> at their first setting into the <HI>Ministry,</HI> met with, Acts 4.18. &amp; 5.40. That was the un∣pardonable Crime, viz. to preach Christ <HI>crucified;</HI> for fear men should get into a new &amp; better way of Salvation, than that of <HI>following their foolish superstitions, the Command∣ments of men,</HI> that brought more gain to them, than pro∣fit to any body else —. Thus Christianity notwith∣standing its brightness and purity, was not only expos'd naked in the day of its Birth, but made odious to the People.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Whence was it thus?</HI></P>
<P N="1">Ans. 1. <HI>The first Preachers of the Gospel, were not such promising, taking, quaint men.</HI> This was the ex∣ception against <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.4. <HI>And my speech, &amp; my preach∣ing was not with enticing words of mans wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit, and of power.</HI> Which the A∣postle acknowledged, under the <HI>Denomination of infirmi∣ty in the flesh,</HI> Gal. 4 13. A crucified Christ was the Rhetorick! The <HI>Roman Empire</HI> was now at its height, <HI>Philosophy &amp; Eloquence</HI> in its flower &amp; vigour, and the <HI>Sages</HI> of that time push'd against the Disciples of Christ and their Doctrine with their might, as fine undertakers (to speak ironically) to new model the World. (Say they) No, the messages of God himself shall be slighted, if brought by such hands: like as the <HI>Emulation</HI> shewed itself at the time of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> under <HI>Luther</HI>'s preaching, when many <HI>Church Dignitarys &amp; Ecclesias∣ticks</HI> could not but own, that sundry things wanted Re∣formation in the Church, but could not bear it should be lead on by a sorry <HI>Monk.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Gospel in its Doctrine &amp; Design is very con∣trary to men's Lusts.</HI> And hence might proceed the op∣position made unto it. This corrupt nature is very fond of, &amp; doth not know how to away with the hard sayings of the Gospel about them, <HI>to deny themselves, &amp; take up their cross, plucking out a right eye, leaving mammon, and laying up treasure on Earth, giving liberally to the poor, &amp; depending upon Heavenly Refundments, loving
<PB N="6" REF="002627_0006_0FDB802B838D0EC0"/>Christ,</HI> &amp;c. which makes some go away from the hearing <HI>with damp, as the young man, who when he heard that saying, went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</HI> Mat. 9.22. And others set up with bold rages, and try to spurn at the Gospel, and run over it.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Meerly for its newness the Gospel might be excepted against.</HI> For our nature is apt to be fond of things we have had a long Intimacy with, and apt to recoyl at In∣novation, if never so much for the better. So you shall see some fond of an old house, 8 house implements, cloaths, hats &amp;c. and if those that are never so much better &amp; more useful, be offered in their room, they are slighted, because those they have had such long acquaintance with, are so dear to them. So their old <HI>Superstitions,</HI> corrupt <HI>Customs</HI> and <HI>Idolatries,</HI> the infidel world would not part with, for a <HI>sound Gospel</HI> —</P>
<P>USE. <HI>Hence the best things that God has sent us in∣to the World may be misconstrued &amp; misrepresented.</HI> When God sent Christ into the World, some said he was a <HI>friend of Publicans &amp; Sinners,</HI> &amp; held a compact with <HI>Belzebub,</HI> to slur &amp; blaspheme his mighty works. And the <HI>Gospel</HI> was by some reputed <HI>babbling, &amp; a setting forth of strange gods.</HI> And the Apostles, <HI>whose feet shou'd have been beautiful, for bringing the glad &amp; gracious tidings of peace &amp; reconciliation by Christ, they were counted pestilent fellows &amp; mad men.</HI> But surely this ought not so to be. This was one effect of the miscon∣duct of Reason depraved, &amp; benighted with the fall, that in some cases it no better discerned good from evil. Whence I would take occasion, to offer to the Consciences of some Neighbours &amp; Brethren, that appear not so well satisfied, a∣bout the Essay of Regulation &amp; Amendment, of the defects of our <HI>public Psalmody,</HI> &amp; to have too <HI>tort &amp; smart</HI> Objections, viz. that they may miss it, &amp; <HI>offend against the generation of the just,</HI> tho' they seem to be pretty sure to themselves; That I am well persuaded, 'ere this Generation pass away, thousands upon better consideration, will see reason to re∣tract precipitant Censures, on conscionable endeavours, to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the religious Interests of <HI>New English Churches,</HI> by
<PB N="7" REF="002627_0007_0FDB15D9B48BBC88"/>to them, lead wrong in an affair of this Nature. But <HI>they have so learned Christ,</HI> and so they understand the Gospel, as they have held forth to you, relating to this Subject. And in relation to something further that may be added on this head, I would premise,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That I can't see there should be any holiness in a Tune; tho' there be holiness in the matter of a sacred Song, to which a Tune is required when it is sung.</HI> Sing∣ing I take to be but melodious reading, &amp; who can shew an Institution for the special moding a Service; nor should any mistake from the propinquity of a <HI>Tune,</HI> to the matter of a <HI>sacred Song,</HI> to the mingling and counting that which is <HI>unhallowed,</HI> with that which is <HI>holy</HI>—. The <HI>grave Tunes</HI> used in foreign Churches, are no more <HI>holy</HI> than ours, nor ours, than theirs; for tho' the <HI>Bible</HI> be an <HI>holy Book</HI> on all considerations, yet the <HI>Cover</HI> put on only to preserve, and put honour thereon, none can imagine <HI>to be holy.</HI> And tho' Christ put honour on a certain <HI>Tune,</HI> (if we knew which of them it was) that he used to sing an <HI>Hymn</HI> with, at the head of his family, &amp; at the first Administration of the second New Testament Sacrament, &amp; last public Ser∣vice he was in on Earth, yet I don't conceive that hereby he put <HI>holiness</HI> thereinto. And suppose it to be as likely that he used then one of those <HI>Tunes,</HI> that are now excep∣ted against by some, as any other; wherefore I would not have any go too fast in rejecting, or putting a slight upon any particular <HI>Tune,</HI> that is used in the Churches, &amp; appro∣ved by the skilful, learned &amp; judicious, least (inverting Luk. 16 15. for a seasonable check here) they be found <HI>abominat∣ing that which is approv'd in Heaven, &amp; was used by Christ in his Family on Earth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Singing is partly a natural, &amp; partly an acquired Gift.</HI> The <HI>To canere,</HI> or <HI>posse canendi,</HI> is concreated with us; the <HI>Ars canendi</HI> is an acquisition by practice, &amp; God's blessing thereon. The <HI>posse</HI> of singing is in-lay'd with us by the God of nature, (together with the <HI>seeing Eye &amp; hear∣ing Ear,</HI> Prov. 10.12.) And which Singers rise to some ex∣pertness in using, by the Divine blessing, on their reading and hearing the Rules of singing, &amp; practising thereon, and by minding &amp; conforming to the Voices of them that were
<PB N="8" REF="002627_0008_0FDB802E8EC4F5C8"/><HI>Singers</HI> before them. Now some have a natural <HI>Genius, Sweetness,</HI> and <HI>Governableness of the Organs, &amp; Strength of Voice</HI> above others: but there are but few indeed, than would fall short, of following a <HI>Tune</HI> in desireable man∣ner, if they would but give their minds to it, and try for it. But still</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>It is a good Gift from the Father of Lights if any can Sing well.</HI> Jam. 1.17 <HI>Every good gift, &amp; every per∣fect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of Lights, &amp;c.</HI> And he that set up <HI>Solomon</HI> to shine with wisdom in <HI>Israel,</HI> made <HI>David</HI> eminently skilful this way, among his people; in which respect, as in many beside he served his Generation; for <HI>the dispensation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal,</HI> be he Prince or Sub∣ject: And <HI>as every one hath received the Gift,</HI> let him be a Civil or Ecclesiastical Ruler; <HI>so let him minifier the same, that God in all things might be glorified.</HI> By what I can learn from the <HI>lively Oracles, David</HI> (&amp; no doubt by Hea∣vens direction) was the first that introduced <HI>singing</HI> into the Church of God, that assistant to the devotion of the godly; and I take him to be at the head of the Regulation of the <HI>sacred Musick,</HI> for <HI>Harmony &amp; Concord</HI> at that glo∣rious <HI>Solemnity</HI> of removing the <HI>Ark to the chosen place for it.</HI> 1 Chron. 15.16, 22. And <HI>other Festivals</HI> in <HI>Israel.</HI> As <HI>David</HI> was serviceable to the <HI>civil Interest</HI> of his peo∣ple, in guarding the Country, &amp; by encouraging trade and business among his Subjects, for such was his upright and princely behaviour at the Court, &amp; such his martial Valour &amp; cunning in the field of War, that he soon grew for mida∣ble to his Enemies, &amp; an amiable Allie; &amp; every one ready to court him or crouch to him: So besides this, was he ser∣viceable in <HI>penning the Psalms, setting the Tunes, &amp; ap∣pointing the Singers, &amp; Instruments of Musick,</HI> for help∣ing the devotions of the Godly; that it is remembred of him, together with his last things &amp; lies as part of his <HI>Epi∣taph,</HI> viz. that he was <HI>Amanus Psalmis intra Israelitas;</HI> and 'tis reckoned among the honours to which <HI>David</HI> was raised, viz. that he was a <HI>Psalmist;</HI> by which he was as tru∣ly great, as by being the <HI>anointed of the God of Jacob,</HI> a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> There is a <HI>mathematical proportion</HI> in the as∣cent,
<PB N="9" REF="002627_0009_0FDB803004D296B0"/>elevation, &amp; falling of the Voice, which they that ar<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> students in the Science can best speak to; &amp; which other would presently come to the knowledge of by study. The fundamental rules &amp; grounds of all <HI>Musick</HI> are but few, but <HI>Mathematically</HI> certain, &amp; are for all Ages, Nations &amp; Pla∣ces: tho' as to the particular Tunes the variation is won∣derful. There is no English Psalm <HI>Tune,</HI> but may be soon leared by them that have an Instructor, &amp; give their minds thereto; only let it be remembred, that God who is the Author of all truth, of <HI>Theological, Logical, Physical,</HI> and <HI>Ethical,</HI> he is so of <HI>Mathematical &amp; Musical</HI> Truth; whose Name is to be praised, for the admirable perfection and excellency he has lay'd into the things of <HI>nature</HI> &amp; <HI>art.</HI> And as the Conditor &amp; Framer of all things he has ordered the <HI>agreement</HI> &amp; <HI>disagreement</HI> of things, [inter se] so that tho' a man &amp; brute agree in <HI>animation;</HI> yet they differ as to <HI>reason;</HI> &amp; the earth &amp; sea agree in <HI>cold,</HI> but differ in respect of <HI>dryness;</HI> which is for the study &amp; contemplati∣on of <HI>Philosophers:</HI> So <HI>God</HI> has ordered <HI>Concord</HI> &amp; <HI>Dis∣cord</HI> in musical elevations, for the students in Musick, that he might be admired in every thing.</P>
<P N="4">4.<HI>Yet strenuous driving after a Regulation of defects in Singing, or after additional Tunes I approve not; es∣pecially if some see it not so practicable, &amp; lothly come into it.</HI> For I reckon it to be in this matter, as with the Church of old, a shifting from <HI>Judaism</HI> to <HI>Christianity,</HI> &amp; some not sufficiently instructed, in that liberty purchas∣ed by the Death of Christ, would have the <HI>galling Yoke of Ceremonies</HI> longer kept on the neck of <HI>Disciples</HI> than was fit. Acts 15.1, 5. <HI>And certain men which came down from Judea, taught the Brethren, &amp; said, except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be sav∣ed,</HI> &amp;c. which hurt the whole Interest of Christianity, and undervalued the Death of Christ in this point; when yet the result of the Council was (tho' they knew it was an er∣ror contended for) that there should be a present forbear∣ance; that by length of time, they might get light, and conviction of things, that, may be, at present they did not so well see thro'; and to preserve their peace. <HI>Act</HI> 19.22, &amp;c. This <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="10" REF="002627_0010_0FDB8033AA039D80"/>the <HI>Ceremonies</HI> were antiquated, and abolished things, dead and done with, and belonged to the Grave of Christ; yet for the sake of some scrupulous Consciences, they would not drag them out of doors before their eyes; but let them lie by for a while, till they might be carried out to a <HI>de∣cent Funeral.</HI> So tho' we have as much liberty to change our <HI>Tunes</HI> as our <HI>Cloaths,</HI> as we may see reason; and to mend the obvious defects in our <HI>Tunes</HI> as <HI>Cloaths:</HI> by how much thro' the long use, of imperfectly sounded Tunes in our Congregations, they have gain'd a veneration from some, as if a sort of <HI>sacredness</HI> with them, that makes them flinch at the seeming innovation &amp; real amendment essay'd; there should be gentle progress (I count) and forbearance of going the whole circle and latitude of our right and claim, least we bear too hard on our Brethren's Spirits, <HI>for whom Christ dyed.</HI></P>
<P>But next I would say something by way of Answer to some Queries that seem to be obtruded, especially some of them on the Singing side.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Is it equal, that the Elderly, should yield, to be turned out of the old way of Singing, to gratify the Young∣erly, who urge on a Regulation the most.</HI></P>
<P>Ans. <HI>It is not to yield to man but to God, to fall in with a more advantageous way of performing his Wor∣ship.</HI> In the times that we can look back to, there were no such helps and advantages, to get skill in Singing as now; if so I Question not, but our <HI>Fathers</HI> would have fallen in therewith. And that now God has stirred up some to im∣prove their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this way, I see not but that <HI>elder</HI> &amp; <HI>young∣er</HI> that would have cases determined by Reason and Reli∣gion, ought to improve it, and praise God for it. The <HI>younger</HI> Generations have ordinarily, the clearest &amp; stron∣gest Voices, and so it will be to the end of time; &amp; 'tis no wonder if there be something the most heard of them, in such an alteration and reformation as seems to be now on foot: who yet must be advised to <HI>be soberminded,</HI> and to be humble and thankful to the <HI>Lord,</HI> and full of respect to <HI>Superiours,</HI> and farthest from Ostentation and despising others, tho' grown to <HI>Barzillai's condition &amp; infirmity,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="11" REF="002627_0011_0FDB803545A991D8"/><HI>and can I discern between good &amp; evil? — Can I hear any more the voice of singing men &amp; singing women? Wherefore should then thy Servant be yet a burden to my Lord the King?</HI> And the <HI>elder</HI> among us must be exhorted to comply and fall in with the well approved &amp; promising reformation, least their sharp contradiction to their sur∣prize be interpreted at the Supream Bar, their <HI>fighting against God.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Were our Fathers to blame for Singing God's Praises in that way that is now censur'd for it's defects.</HI></P>
<P>Ans. <HI>Persons are accepted of God, if with a good and honest heart, they Sing, Pray or Read God's Word as well as they can.</HI> But to do these <HI>brokenly,</HI> when they might do them more <HI>accurately</HI> is a disrespect &amp; dishonour to God, &amp; therefore censurable. A Person performing a holy Service, with many lamenesses and defects while he don't know better, may be accepted of God; but when he knows how to come to amendment hereof and refuses, and sets himself against it, he will have tho't to Answer to God—. And I see not but some Congregations, and sundry in many more, are to be blamed for their ignorance and heedlessness about the <HI>Tunes,</HI> that may be can't distin∣guish one <HI>Tune</HI> from another when Sung, and slide out of one <HI>Tune</HI> into another, and do not mind it, or Sing the Lines of several <HI>Tunes</HI> for one: when a little care &amp; study indeed would have saved the Disorder. Therefore I would propose, there might be many Advantages attending a Practice which I could wish all our Congregations were come into, viz to name the <HI>Tune</HI> together with the <HI>Psalm,</HI> and all the <HI>Skilful</HI> of the Congregation be sure to fall in with the first Note &amp; Syllable; nor is this a bare Proposal without Experiment: for some of us have been some time in proof hereof, and see its Expediency.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>This new way is not Singing in the Spirit, is it?</HI></P>
<P>Ans. <HI>As much as the old way is, and no odds in that!</HI> But it is not the outward sounding of a Song any way, that amounts to that; where this is all with any Sinners, they are <HI>but as sounding Brass, &amp; a tinkling Cymbal,</HI> let their Voices be never so good and Skill <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="12" REF="002627_0012_0FDB8036C10C6EC0"/>with the zeal and integrity of the Heart, and by the rules of (Joh. 4.24. <HI>God is a Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in Spirit &amp; Truth.</HI> And, Rom. 1.9. <HI>God is my witness, whom I serve with my Spirit. &amp;c.</HI>) or by the Holy Ghost furnishing us thereto, and aiding us therein, or both: And so it is too Superiour a thing, in the Practice of Singing to bear a <HI>flant.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Can you desire us to be reconciled to the new way of Singing, when it brings in so much disturbance with it?</HI></P>
<P>Ans. <HI>I must needs ask leave here to plead, that the blame is mislay'd; and the wrong Horse Sadled.</HI> For that which ought to be laid to the weakness or some men's reason, and to strength of passion in others, is bro't and charg'd upon <HI>Regular Singing.</HI> For consider, if you have an Important Journey to go, and go forth to procure an Horse, or other requisites thereto, and <HI>a Shower come upon you, or you dash your Foot against a Stone, or by any other Accident you become Wounded,</HI> must your going forth on the Errand be therefore Censured, when it may be the Occasion is as Rational and Vindicable as can be. We always say, it is unreasonable to measure <HI>Causes by Effects,</HI> or Censure or Justify <HI>them</HI> by their <HI>Consequents.</HI> For then if a Son take to ill Courses, his Father, as a <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> must be blam'd, tho' such Courses of his Son be never so grievous to him, and he never so copious in dis∣swasives against the same.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Well if you could shew this new way of Singing, were commanded in Scripture, I should not dare speak a word against it?</HI></P>
<P>Ans. <HI>If I did not suppose it there commanded &amp; re∣quired, I should not dare speak a word for it.</HI> i. e. tho' it be not in terms inserted, if by just Consequence, I could not fairly deduce it therefrom to my satisfaction, I should not appear to Advocate for it. I think it contain∣ed in Psal. 33.2, 3. <HI>Praise the Lord with Harp, Sing unto him with the Psaltery, and an Instrument of ten Strings. Sing unto him a new Song, play</HI> SKILFULLY <HI>with a loud Voice.</HI> For I can't suppose, the moral part

When <HI>In∣struments of Musick,</HI> were more Laudable in the Wor∣ship of God, than now under a more Spiritual Dispensa∣tion, then the Sweet <HI>Singers</HI> Direction was, to observe the <HI>Consort</HI> between <HI>Harp and Voice,</HI> keep <HI>time</HI> &amp; <HI>mea∣sure;</HI> and manage each their work <HI>dexterously.</HI> Besides this plain and direct Precept for it, there are very in∣structive and convictive general precepts &amp; hints, in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.40.2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 24.24 <HI>Mal.</HI> 1.14 &amp; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.31. <HI>Covet earnestly the best Gifts</HI>— And how many things do we practice in the Church of God, relating to the Worship of God, deduced from <HI>general Precepts;</HI> only such as Building sightly and comfortable <HI>Meeting-Houses,</HI> putting on our <HI>best Apparel</HI> on the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and if at distance we take our <HI>Horses to ride</HI> &amp;c. that are not in Terms commanded us; Besides Electing <HI>Men of Learning and Gifts, apt to teach,</HI> for the Work of the <HI>Ministry,</HI> that may with fittest Expressions carry our requests to God, in the <HI>publick Prayers,</HI> and that can choose <HI>acceptable words</HI> for <HI>Sermons;</HI> whereas <HI>illiterate Persons</HI> could with more ease and less Charge be introduced; which yet you will not hear of or yield to, to avoid the Constructi∣on, and imputation; that we count any thing good enough for the Service of God; and that the <HI>Lame &amp; Maimed</HI> of our Flock, will do well eno', when we know God will have the <HI>Male and best</HI> of us or nothing.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Well, but Regular Singing is not the great Cause of Religion, is it?</HI></P>
<P>Ans. <HI>No, but it is one of the well equip'd hand-mai∣dens waiting upon a Religious Exercise.</HI> If one had got∣ten a <HI>Horse, Hat,</HI> or <HI>Garb,</HI> that gave offence, or that a Brother were disturbed at, such might by an act of self-denial consent to put either any or all of them away, to re∣cover their temper; and no Prejudice, but Credit would be to <HI>Religion</HI> hereby: but that which is under Consideration, can't be let drop, without a plain hurt to a main Exercise of <HI>Religion,</HI> altho' it be not itself a <HI>principal Pillar</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="14" REF="002627_0014_0FDB803C30920948"/>ble <HI>Singing,</HI> and <HI>Sing</HI> after a sort, had we learnt neither the <HI>new,</HI> nor <HI>old way of Singing,</HI> but to do such a Service most miserably, when we might do it, with more accuracy and Credit; (like them about us that learnt, when we miss'd our Opportunity, and that may be purposely) is contrary to <HI>Scripture caution,</HI> not to expose <HI>our good to be evil spoken of.</HI> Besides as there are <HI>weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy &amp; Truth,</HI> so there are under them things <HI>weighty,</HI> tho' not equally so with the other. But I could wish, that instead of growing into a ferment and controversy hereabout, we could all set our minds to the Apostle's rule, Eph. 4.2, 3. <HI>With all lowliness and meekness, with long suffering, forbearing one another in love; Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of Peace.</HI> And I would have such invectives and flings among <HI>Christians</HI> kept back, concluding that many will have to retract them in time to come, with the tears of Repentance, and wish over and over they had never let them out of their mouths. I could wish we were more sensible of, and willing to part with, the brokenness of our former <HI>Singing,</HI> and in the mean time let not them that are for <HI>Regular Singing,</HI> judge the rest, and <HI>vice versa;</HI> for God receives both, if they humbly and faith∣fully come to Him. And let us go and learn what that meaneth, viz. <HI>to Love one another with a pure heart fervently,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.22. Finally, To such as profess them∣selves to be yet in the dark, in respect of seeing that which is labour'd for to be a gainful <HI>Reformation,</HI> I must needs plead, that to me it promises to befriend and serve the Interest of <HI>Religion.</HI> And as long as you plead that you are thus blinded about it, I intreat you not to let your Passions abroad, nor yet to let your Spirits be sowred hereat. Tho' I desire not to hinder your resenting, and faulting misconduct with some, that have rather too earnest∣ly set themselves to hasten the matter on. But I would not have any that hope to endure the <HI>Tryal at the last Day,</HI> under the Righteousness of the <HI>GREAT REDEEMER,</HI> after an innocent and unblameable Walk among Men, I would not have them allow themselves to fight and strike

Would to God we in our more petty Contests could do likewise. And in the mean time patiently suffer, being most afflicted that Religion suffers, while some too strenuously plead for, the more broken and imperfect carrying on its Exercises; but are the more to be forborn, because not sufficiently aware hereof belike, and so may be said not to know what they do. And we might wind up with 2 Cor. 13.8. <HI>For we can do nothing against the Truth, but for the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>But I can't forbear adding, that I think <HI>David</HI> was a very accurate <HI>Singer,</HI> and that he us'd many Tunes, and some possibly that <HI>some</HI> of ours say, they can't come into of Conscience, tho' others say it is of Ignorance and Fro∣wardness; and that as his mind was much in the exercise <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind, I did cast them out as dirt in the streets.</HI> And that <HI>in quitting the field,</HI> Psal. 144.10. <HI>It is he that giveth Salvation to Kings, who delivereth David his Servant, from the hurtful Sword.</HI> And it seems as if that were his <HI>Storming Song,</HI> when in spite of all the <HI>Guards his Enemies</HI> could set, he was resolved to Scale the Walls of their Fortresses, Psal. 18 29. <HI>For by thee have I run thro' a troop, by my God have I leaped over a wall.</HI> And Oh! that we were of one mind about the <HI>mode of Singing his holy Songs;</HI> not only for the sake of mak∣ing our selves <HI>Masters</HI> of <HI>Strong Cities</HI> and <HI>Impregna∣ble Castles</HI> if sent against them, and defying <HI>Ramparts and Bulwarks,</HI> but for the sake <HI>of fighting the good fight of Faith, Scaling Heaven, and taking its King∣dom with Violence, and inheriting with him, and all the Saved there, Eternal Life.</HI> Amen.</P>
