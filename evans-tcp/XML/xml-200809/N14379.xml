<HEAD>REMARKS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="letter">
<HEAD>To Mr. Mather.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS the subject before us is the common salvation, I take li∣berty to lay aside your addition, as that which no way be∣longs to the point in controversy, and consider myself as on a per∣fect level with you, (your superiority in years excepted, to which I mean ever to have a due regard) that I may write with that free∣dom and plainess, that becomes one, contending for a truth, which I judge, of equal importance to all the descendants from apostate Adam. I remember to have heard this observation, that while we are attempting to pull down our neighbour's one idol, we are in danger of setting up two of our own; but I hope I am not so ignorant of the pride of the human heart, and the devices of the grand adversary, as to think myself not equally liable with others engaged in controversial writings, to contend for victory and triumph, rather than truth; and of being influenced by the vanity of my carnal mind, rather than the meekness and gentleness of Christ. To him who is able to keep me from falling into the condemnation of the devil, I now commit myself, and proceed to the remarks proposed; may they be made with that meekness that becomes the man who fears God, loves his truth, doth not despise, but love his neighbour.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the many objections I have against your performance, I must acknowledge there are some things in it that justly demands one's attention, in the premonition to the reader; your bringing up to view, Matthew 7, 13, 14, the exhortation to enter into the straight gate—and to beware of false prophets; was very agreeable as you present it to view—"as coming from the great light of the world, the only and true way to God and hap∣piness;" and it sixed my tho'ts the more, as it is a passage of scripture that has many years engaged me in the inquiring what is the true
<PB N="4" REF="018215_0003_0FA5C101B50A6E20"/>
import of it, as not knowing but that I might profit by your inter∣pretations thereof, which indeed did not appear satisfactory to my mind, more than any thing that I had been before acquainted with; therefore I set my self to inquire into the meaning of those words of the Lord and Saviour, with other parts of the divine word, by compairing scripture with scripture, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is undoubtedly the best, and is its own interpreter.—When I consider Jesus Christ, as made under the law, and speaking as under the law to those that were also under it, and that it was his d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sign to manifest himself as the true Messiah▪ the antitype of what took place under that dispensation, I apprehend in this exhortation he has the same thing in view, and speaks of himself as the antitype of what was said of the gate in the old testament scriptures; perhaps in Ezekiel chap 43, 4 &amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 4.2.3. and 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 19, which passages were they well understood, perhaps would illustrate this matter; but I shall only take notice of what is said in psalm 11<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.19, 20, where the Messiah is brought in, saying, <HI>open to me the gates of righteousness; I will go in to them and praise the Lord; this gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter.</HI>—Here we have the mediator in virtue of his own righteousness, calling for the opening the gates of righte¦ousness, which may be illustrated by <HI>John</HI> 10 2. <HI>he that en∣ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th by the door is the shepherd of the sheep, and he enters the gate of righteousness as head of his body.</HI>—By his own righteous∣ness, his perfect obedience to the law and his full satisfaction to divine justice, in which the father is well pleased: So entering by him, is entering into the straight gate, into the narrow way, the only way leading to life; Jesus Christ admitts no competitor, no rival with him; nothing to be made mention of, but his righteous∣ness and his only; not meerely for the entrance into the gate; but all along the narrow way, and so jealous is he of his honor, that he allows of no subjection to any other lord;—this appears to me, the most likely meaning of the straight gate and narrow way, which it is manifest there be but few that find; as it is natural for us all in some way or other besides him, to go about to establish our own righteousness and seek to enter in thereby which though many seek thus to enter, they never shall be able; (for eminently he is the way, the truth and the life) whilst the body of the Jew∣ish nation were seeking righteousness by the works of the law, the Lord lets them know the master of the house was about to rise up and that the door of that dispensation; and when he shall have so don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their knocking and pleading, what they had been done and
<PB N="5" REF="018215_0004_0FA5C104AFACA2B8"/>
the many advantages they had enjoyed, would not avail them while they rejected the straight gate and narrow way and they with their pleas utterly rejected; while he should say to them I know you not, while others▪ i. e. the Gentiles, should come from the east and west, north and south, and sit down with the patriarchs; and thus it would appear that the great saviour according to the good pleasure of his will, was found of them that sought him not; thus Israel that followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righ∣teousness; wherefore, because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law: if the two passages that speak of the straight gate be considered and compared. I think these thoughts must appear agreeable to the scope of them. <HI>Matthew</HI> 7.13. and <HI>Luke</HI> 13.13, 24—and it must be acknowledged that it was not more the error of the people under the old dispensation by many deceitful ways, to be endeavouring to establish their own righteous∣ness, than it is for those who call themselves christians, and the un∣certainty and perplexity which arises from that painful question. What lack I yet, will forever torment them, till the straight gate and narrow way i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wide opened to them; wherefore woe to them who pretend to another gate or way beside Jesus Christ the true way; he warns against false prophets that come in sheeps cloath∣ing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves and says▪ by their fruits ye shall know them; do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of this∣tles; the fruits by which Mr. <HI>Mather</HI> judges of them "is their own irregular worldly and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ual lives and conversations;" and the same fruits of their doctrine, but as this is not a satisfactory discovery because men of such lives and doctrines don't come in sheeps cloathing, but appear outwardly and inwardly alike, and there does not seem much danger of their deceiving. It may then be inquired, who are the false prophets? I answer, our Lord who hath warned us against them, has not left us without their distinguish∣ing marks, by which to know them; therefore looking for the mean∣ing of Jesus Christ, let us compare the passage with the apostle <HI>Pe∣ter,</HI> 2d. epist. 2 chap beginning who says, <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re were false prophets among the people, even as there sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mnable errors, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction, &amp;c.</HI> Denying the Lord that bought them; as in the straight gate and narrow way; the gospel admits of no competitor, no rival with Jesus Christ, nothing to be made mention of but his righte∣ousness, no subjection to any foreign lord; so the false teachers are
<PB N="6" REF="018215_0005_0FA5C104DAF9B748"/>
those that privily bring in something besides, and cannot trust the finished work of Christ alone, as the exclusive ground of hope to∣wards God, without something wrought in us or done by us to re∣commend us to the divine favour; and though these teachers will with much plausible language speak honourable of Jesus Christ; yet will warn of the danger of holding his character and finished work as witnessed in his resurrection, as the sole foundation of hoping for divine mercy to eternal life; is not this privily denying the Lord that bought them.—Again when the scriptures assert, <HI>that he gave himself a ransom for all;—that he tasted death for every man;—— that he is the propiciation for the whole world;—th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he will have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth:</HI> (or even as some read, coming to the knowledge of the truth and being saved) the love of Christ constrained the apostle thus to judge; <HI>that if one died for all, then were a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l dead, and that he died for all, that they which live should not hence forth live to themselves, but unto him that died for them and rose again; that as sin reigned to death, even so might grace reign through righte∣ousness to eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord</HI> —Is it not denying the Lord that bought them, to assert this cannot be scripture doc∣trine because it leads to licentiousness; when the apostle truly says, <HI>he died for all, that those that live should not henceforth live to themselves, but to him that died for them and rose again</HI>;—and another apostle tell us; <HI>we love him because he first loved us; and this is the love of God that we keep his commandments;—let God be true and every man a lyar.</HI> The doctrine of Christ leads to himself as the true vine, the cause of fruitfulness; the root of the righteous that yieldeth fruit agreeable to▪ <HI>Hosea</HI> 14, 8. <HI>from me is thy fruit found;</HI>——and to <HI>John</HI> 15. beginning; <HI>as the branch cannot bear fruit except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, ex∣cept ye abide in me;—I am the vine, yea are the branches, he that abideth in me and I in him, the same bringeth forth m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch fruit, for without me ye can do nothing.</HI>—Now when obedience is urged from other motives and to other ends by false teachers, we may as well gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles —! must here make a pause, that I may acknowledge the great satisfaction you gave me in your remarks upon Mr. <HI>White</HI>; the full testimony you have given to the doctrine of the great God our Saviour. —I mean to credit you for the whole of what you have written from page twelve, line eleven, from the bottom—"but there is one thing that follows, that is quite inexcusable;"—"mark says he, who is this saviour,
<PB N="7" REF="018215_0006_0FA5C105EB7FB248"/>
i.e. of all men; it is God, not Christ."—"Let us look into 1st. of <HI>Timothy,</HI> 2.3. and we shall see who is God our saviour, and we shall see that in the Greek it runs, <HI>in the sight of the saviour our God, and servants are enjoined to shew all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of God our saviour in all things,</HI> in <HI>Titus</HI> 2.10. but it is in the Greek, <HI>that they may adorn the doctrine of the saviour our God in all things</HI>—and how contrary is this to the interpretation of Mr. <HI>White,</HI> as well as other Arians. How∣ever, it is the truth as it is in Jesus the saviour our God and worthy of all acceptation." And in page 14. line 8 from the top, you say, "if the words be justly translated the sense will be, there is one God and one mediator of God and man, the man Christ Jesus, and so it signifies that the mediator is both God and man;— but we note, that the learned <HI>Bitterfield,</HI> has proposed this transla∣tion of the words, which it must be owned answers word for word to the Greek;—the one God, the one who is also mediator of God and man, is the man Christ Jesus; so then the man Christ Jesus, who is the mediator, is God as well as man, so that he is God and man united." The above quotation is what strikes my mind with satisfaction, as the truth as it is in Jesus the saviour our God; and were I capaci∣tated to recommend them to every ones consideration I would do it—though I cannot, I dare not, for any other paragraph in your whole performance;—and what follows immediately here∣upon, is as shocking as that quotation was pleasing; to which you add, "but although this mediator has given himself a ransom for all; for it must be granted that he has given a sufficient ransom and propitiation for all; and he will not cast abroad any, who pe∣nitently come to him as he requires, to gain and enjoy the benefit of it; yet it is no where said, that they who will not come to him for life and happiness shall enjoy the benefit of his ransom and propitiation;"—the sum of which is, that though our saviour be God and has given himself a ransom, a sufficient ransom and pro∣pitiation for all, yet it depends upon the will of man, whether any shall enjoy the benefits of it;—I would ask you sir? Did you ever read <HI>Jeremiah</HI> 31, 31, 34. and chap. 32.38, 40, and chap. 33, 8. with the <HI>Hebrews</HI> 8, from 8. to the end, and <HI>Hebrews</HI> 10, 16, 17, 18.—you seem indeed sir, as if you thought the new co∣venant might be broken as the old one was; but it must be from your inattention to the scriptures.—<HI>I will be their God and they shall be my people, I will clense them from all their iniquities whereby they have sinned, against me, and I will pardon all their ini∣iquities
<PB N="8" REF="018215_0007_0FA5C106655ACE20"/>
whereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed aginast me</HI>; the ground of which is the sufficiency of the ransom and propitiation —<HI>I will forgive their iniquitie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and remember their sins no more;</HI> alluding to the sacrifice of Christ, where the remi∣tion of them was <HI>Hebrews</HI> 10, 17.18 and the apostle says, <HI>hav∣ing therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</HI>—their boldness did not arise from their own repentance, their own good dispositions; but came in by the blood of Jesus.— Would it have been possible for you to expressed yourself as you have done if you had attended to <HI>Isaiah</HI> 45.22 3.4. <HI>Look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth, for I God and none else; I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righte∣ousness and shall not return, that unto me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear surely shall say in the Lord have I righte∣ousness and strength to him shall come and all that are insensed against him shall be ashamed: in the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified and shall glory.</HI></P>
<P>SIR, it you could accept advice from one, but a few years younger than yourself, it would be to lay aside your numerous train of commentators and antient fathers (about five and twenty of which have been called in to your aid in your little piece) and leave the scripture to speak for themselves; for instance, suppose we should say aside Mess'rs. <HI>White, Austin, Beza</HI> and <HI>Grotious,</HI> upon 1 of <HI>Timothy.</HI> 2, 3, 4 and betake ourselves to the scrip∣tures for to find the meaning. <HI>I exhort therefore that first of all, supplication, prayer, intercession and giving of thanks, be made for all men for kings and even all in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> godliness and honesty</HI>; and the ground and reason upon which the apostle founds his exhortation is as fol∣lows; <HI>for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our sa∣viour, who will have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth</HI>; for the one God, the one who is also mediator of God and man, (as you say it is in the Greek) <HI>gave himself a ran∣som for all.</HI> Here we see the paryer of faith in the public assem∣bly was to be ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e for a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rding to the will of God, and to which the people of God could heartily say, AMEN—for there is ground of faith in prayer for all men.</P>
<P>FOR kings, is it not said; <HI>Psalm</HI> 72.10, 11. <HI>the kings of Tar∣shish and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es shall bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g presents; the kings of Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ba and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ba▪ shall offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gifts; yea all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.

And though the blessing was forfeited, it was not revoked or recalled, for the gifts and callings of God are without repentance; if he gives commandment to bless it cannot be reversed. <HI>Numb</HI> 23.19. <HI>God is not a man that he shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d lie, nei∣ther the son of man that he should repent; hath he said it, and shall he not do; or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good? behold! I have received to bless, and he hath blessed, and I can∣not reverse it;</HI>—Therefore on the fall of our first parents the ser∣pent was cursed, and the way in which the pronounced blessing should take place, is revealed in the promised seed of the woman, and afterwards to <HI>Abraham—In thy seed shall all the nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s of the earth be blessed;</HI> and afterwards in the priesthood, sacrifi∣ces types and shadows of the Jewish di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pensation—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ro∣phets</HI> and in the <HI>Psalms; concerning him who is mighty to save, God over all blessed forever</HI>: When I consider that for the ac∣complishment of this great and comprehensive truth full of bless∣ing—<HI>God was manifest in the flesh, the on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God the medi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God and man, the man Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Jesus; the brightsness of the di∣vine glory and the express image of his person, in whom the fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess of the godhead dwelt:</HI> I inquire, did not the fullne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the Hu∣man as well as the divi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e nature, dwell in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m als<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>?

<PB N="10" REF="018215_0009_0FA5C1086DAA1428"/>
him; and that as head of every man he gave himself a ransom for all, therefore to pray for all men, is good and acceptable in the sight of God our saviour, who will have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth;—but you say, page 13, "May they expect to be brought to this saving knowledge in a land of darkness and misery; we have no warrant for thinking any such thing from the word of God." How shocking is this, where God hath said by his messenger, he will hate all men to come to the knowledge of the truth;—it savors of the same impious infide∣lity that the people of antient Israel were chargeable with; <HI>Psalm</HI> 78.19. <HI>yea they spake against God; they said, can God prepare a table in the wilderness</HI>? verse 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Can he give bread also; can he provide flesh for his people; hath he said and shall he not do it; hath he spoken, and shall he not bring it to pass? The Lord gave the word and great was the company of those that pub∣lished it, for with God all things are possible.</HI></P>
<P>Now as Christ was the head of every man, when he was lift up, he drew all men unto him; and so when one died for all, then were all dead.—Please sir to look into the text in 1st. of <HI>Corinthians</HI> 5.14. in your Greek testament, and see if it is not there, <HI>if one died for all, then all died.</HI></P>
<P>Is not Paul to be thus understood, when he says, <HI>I was cruci∣fied with Christ</HI>? Was it his privilege <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was Paul's privilege indeed to be acquainted with this grace, to enjoy the comfort of it, and to be influenced to fruitfulness by it; while it was not the divine good pleasure to manifest himself to the world; but <HI>John</HI> 17.21, 22, 23. informs us, <HI>there is a time coming, when the world shall know and be∣lieve that Jesus Christ is the sent of God; know and believe the same truth that the disciples knew and believed.</HI> verse 8. <HI>Which then, distinguished them from the world, and this is what Jesus had in view in praying for his immediate disciples, and those that should believe through their word.</HI></NOTE> only, or did Christ by the grace of God taste death for every man?

<P>There is another text mentioned, (which though my mind has been much exercised, and it may be, have not yet, that understand∣ing of, as I could wish) your illustration thereof, not being satisfac∣tory upon it by any means. Let us look for the meaning of it by

<P>In taking notice of the title page, you say, "Even the title page is not without its errors; it is this salvation for all men illus∣trated and vindicated as a scripture doctrine; had the writer in∣tended, and said, salvation for all men revealed and offered in the gospel; this would have passed well enough for a scripture doctrine; but that all men shall actually obtain salvation sooner or later▪ which is the intent and meaning of this writer, this cannot be fairly illustrated from the sacred writings, nor can it be fairly and honestly vindicated as a scripture doctrine." Let us look of this
<PB N="14" REF="018215_0013_0FA5C10AEAB36580"/>
a little: "Salvation for all men revealed a scripture dictrine,"— then it is a truth, a revealed truth it could not be, if it were not an original, eternal truth. I think I need say no more on this. "Salva∣tion for all men revealed and offered in the gospel";—that Jesus Christ or his salvation are offered in the gospel, is without any foundation in the scriptures, and conveys an idea very dishonour∣able to him and very exalting to human pride;—if any thing be offered to me I am at once in some respects upon a level with the offerer, and may receive or not as I please; the gospel reveals Jesus Christ and his salvation, and where the evidence of the truth strikes the conscience, the light discovers that however incensed against him, I have been, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be intirely beholden to him for salvation, and must be subject to his authority, or fall under his dis∣pleasure, I cannot quit his dominions —<HI>Acts</HI> 4 11, 12. The va∣rious passages, where the call and invitation of the gospel are spok∣en of, such as, <HI>look to me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth, come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest,</HI> calls the attention of the lost bewildered children of men that are grouping in the dark after salvation and rest, to the object where salvation and rest is to be found; for as <HI>Moses lift up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have ever∣lasting life</HI>; he is brought to view, that whosoever believeth the truth concerning him that has his mind satisfied on divine evi∣dence of the truth, testified of Christ and his salvation, should not perish but have eternal life, the faith of the gospel is the belief of the truth, not the accepting of an offer: But were it that salvation was offered to all, it could not be sincere if it was not for all; <HI>but God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.</HI></P>
<P>SIR, one thing more I would take notice of, is this, that as the title of your piece is, <HI>"All men will not be saved"</HI> the design of your piece is to prove the title; and the reason is given in page 25, line 7 from the top—"on the other hand, it is plain and evident to all sound and considerate minds, that the broaching of it (viz. the doctrine of universal salvation) has a very dangerous ten∣dency; and hence it should not be admitted for a scripture truth," when at the same time you say, page 24, line 9 from the bottom, "nor is there the least reason to believe, that their sufferings will make them the willing people of God, as the sufferings of punishment naturally excites an aversion in the sufferer, to the inflictor of the

punishment; and as the sufferings and torments increase and go forward, the enmity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of those that endure them, proceed and encrease against their punisher." If this be true (as undoubt∣edly it is) it's easy to see the dreadful tendency of your endeavours, through your whole performance. Indeed, Sir, you have here out-done me, for I want words to expres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the inconsistency and im∣piety, appearing in the passages put together, especially when I take into view the last sentence,—"and let all the human race, as we are required, serve Jehovah, our Lord and Judge, with fear and trembling before him, from consideration of his holiness and righteousness, his terrible majesty, and consummate truth and faith∣fulness; and let us seasonably repent and give glory to God in Christ Jesus▪ that we may not be vexed in his sore and perpetual displeasure, but that we may be blessed in him, and with him com∣pleatly and forever" Such an affront upon the human race, at least on that part of them that will not be saved, according to your title (such an affront on Jehovah our Lord, our God and Judge, God our Savour, is here offered that repentance is here put in his place, as that which will go beyond the ransom he paid, so that though all men will not be saved thereby, yet if they repent and give glory to God in Christ, they may) that though they will not be saved, they are called to repent, that they may. Was poor creatures ever more tantalized.</P>
<P>But that I may not indulge myself too far, I will sum up what I hare to say in the language of scripture. You seem to me to appear here, as the Jews, who being ignorant of God's righteous∣ness, and going about to establish their own, have not submitted to the righteousness of God.</P>
<P>One would think both your extractor and yourself, were better acquainted with the weapons that are carnal, and not mighty thro' God, by your opposing learned and pious men, to learned and pious men, and sitting imaginations, and high things that exalt them∣selves against the knowledge of God; and had the extractor been led by the spirit of the truth, he would appear to vindicate, he would have seen himself upon a perfect level with his fellow-sinners, be∣holden to mere mercy with the vilest, and not, in confidence of his own superiority, set at nought a stranger, by ignorantly endeavour∣ing to slur his doctrine, which he himself, as yet, appears unac∣quainted with: But he makes himself a preacher—is not made so as we are—he followeth not us.</P>
<P>When John, in the name of the rest of the disciples said to Jesus,
<PB N="16" REF="018215_0015_0FA5C10C71FEB8A8"/>
<HI>we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him be∣cause he followed not us,</HI> he kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w they were set apart to their work by Jesus Christ himself, yet he was rebuk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and got the repeated warning against offences that we have taken notice of in the 9th of <HI>Mark.</HI> from the 43d.</P>
<P>How unbecoming then must it be for those who have any ground to question the truth of their being taught of God to know Jesus Christ, and of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being divinely called to preach him, to treat those that preach Jesus Christ in such a manner, because they fol∣lowed not them.</P>
<P>It would become us whenever we find our selves disposed to of∣fend any of those little ones that believe in Jesus, or at least for whom he died, to attend soberly to the above mentioned 9th of <HI>Mark,</HI> and when we come understand and practice the exhortation in the 50th verse, <HI>have salt in yourselves,</HI> it will lead us to peace one wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h another.</P>
<P>I would also take noti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the extractor's endeavouring to distin∣guish himself, by bringing in the state of unutterable m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssery that many of the sons and daughters of Adam will pass through, before they are prepared for, and admitted to, the joys of God's presence in heaven.</P>
<P>If he intends this as the legal penalty they are to suffer for sin, he sets aside the atonement, and puts sufferings in its room, as you appear to put repen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance in the place of the great propitiation, in your last paragraph I think there is an obvious distinction be∣tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en the pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ishment <HI>of</HI> sin and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e punishment <HI>for</HI> sin, held up in the scriptures.</P>

scripture testimony held up; but the scriptures, as held and ex∣plained by eminent men, is by him bro't to view, that our faith might stand in the wisdom of men, not in the word of God, and thus has cause of shame, especially that he should extract the one thing that you justly say is quite inexcusable "and mark you, who is this saviour, it is God, not Christ." but why is this distinction, we know nothing of God, but as he manifests himself in Christ: When Philip said to Jesus, <HI>Lord shew us the father and it sufficeth us; Jesus saith unto him, have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me, hath seen the father; and how sayed thou, shew us the father; believest thou not that I am in the father and the father in me: and no man knoweth the son but the father, neither knoweth any man the father but the son, and he t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whomsoever the son will, revealeth him</HI>; and Jesus Christ says, <HI>I have manife<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted thy name to the men which thou gavest me out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the world, and I hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> declared unto them thy name, and will de∣clare it, that the love wherewith thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them.</HI></P>
<P>I do not conceive how men can have a satisfactory apprehension that they worship one God, that make such distinctions, unless they mean to set aside Jesus Christ as the object of worship, if he be not God our saviour; if God, not Christ is this saviour; then Jesus Christ is not the object of worship; and if this be the real sentiment, I need no longer wonder to hear men pray to God, without any mention of the name of Jesus Christ, till they are one quarter or one third through their prayer, or in some instances, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill the close of their prayer; it is enough to draw forth the lamentation of Mary from the worshippers of Jesus, or them that call on that name: They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have said him.

When the whole body of which Christ is the head, are subject to him, are redeemed from sin and satan; it is called the adoption: When Adam, who was the son of God; called the son of God in his relative capacity, as head of the human nature, turned prodigal with all the disobedience, shame, sorrow, guilt and misery atten∣dant thereupon, is recovered by the second Adam, to favour, to subjection, and to the adoption; the son himself is subject to him that put all things under him.

You add "And not suffer any contempt to be cast upon him, by the bold transgressors against his holy will and laws:—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow is that to be prevented according to you?

Now when we consider this, it obviates the objection that has been raised, after this manner: Yes, every knee shall bow at the name of Jesus: One day they shall all be brought to own him Lord; to their eternal confusion they shall bow at his name, as a poor criminal at the name of the Judge that is just going to pronounce a sentence of death, from which, there is no appeal nor escape.</P><P>But the text says, <HI>That in the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</HI> As when a poor woman, who hath no riches, no worthiness, nothing by which she can attain any thing in her own name, is married to a Prince, she is intituled to his name, his person, his riches, his honour, and now appearing in his name, she is regarded as him. So when in the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow, it is in this view, exactly similiar to the Pro∣phet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> to which the apostle here alludes; the very matter of what every tongue shall swear, is, <HI>Surely shall say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength, to him shall come</HI>;—Surely shall say, the mind shall be as satis∣fied of this truth, as ever any person was of any thing to which he was called to swear; these things being so, we have the joint evidence of both testaments to this truth, confirmed by the blood of the new testament, by the death of the testator, and witness in his resurrection: So however dark, ignorant, guilty and miserable, we are in ourselves; when we come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, to bow in his name, we may sing: <Q><L>Thou art our wisdom, Thou our guide,</L><L>Thou art our righteousness;</L><L>We're blind and guilty, thee besides,</L><L>Thou art our holiness.</L><L>From slavery and bonds to sin,</L><L>Thou us, alone can'st free;</L><L>From captive state, where we have been,</L><L>Redemption we shall see.</L></Q></P><P>For he is made to us, of God, wisdom, righteousness, sanctifica∣tion and redemption: He hath a name above every name, <HI>That in the name of Jesus, every knee shall bow, every tongue surely shall say; In the Lord have I righteousness and strength; to him shall come.</HI> So be it, the Lord hasten it, in his time.</P></NOTE> and every tongue shall swear, surely shall say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength—unto him shall come, and all that are insensed against him in all be ashamed: In the Lord shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth.</HI>—Here is a call or command, to all the ends of the earth, it is his pleasure that it should be so; and what the Lord pleaseth, that he doth: <HI>For I God and none else, I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness—That unto me, every knee</HI> shall bow, <HI>and every tongue</HI> shall swear.—Then follows the mat∣ter of the oath that every tongue shall swear, <HI>Surely shall say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength</HI>;—This being con∣sidered, will invalidate the objection; for if every tongue shall surely say, in the Lord have I righteousness and strength, they shall surely be saved by him, they shall have no lack of righteous∣ness nor strength.—<HI>Unto him shall come</HI>— And surely the comers are the true worshippers, they are so described, under the old tes∣tament dispensation, as <HI>Hebrews</HI> 10.1.—Could never make the comer thereunto perfect; that is, the worshippers under that dis∣pensation, and under the new testament dispensation.

<P>This being the case, way is made to call upon "all the human race, as we are required, to serve Jehovah our Lord, our God and Judge, with fear, and rejoice with trembling, and seasonably repent and give glory to God in Christ Jesus;" not as you express it, "that we may not be vexed with his sore and perpetual displeasure," but because he has blotted out, as a thick cloud, our transgressions, and as a cloud, our sins, we are called to return, for I have redeemed thee. <HI>Isaiah</HI> 44.22.</P>

<P>The reason I would offer, is in the words of the Apostle, <HI>Sin reigns to death, but grace reigns through righteousness to eternal life by Jesus Christ,</HI> who says, <HI>because I live, ye shall live also: But death, which is the wages of sin, and the extent of its reign

<P>UPON reflecting on the truth contained in the foregoing letter, there arises to view these reflections, as resulting therefrom, viz. 1st. The obligations to love; 2dly Submission; 3dly, Gratitude and obedience; and 4thly. Thanksgiving.</P>
<P N="1">1st. Love to him who hath thus loved us. <HI>We love him because he first loved us: God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him; and this commandment have we from him, that he that loveth God, love his brother also; if God so loved us, we ought to love one ano<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her.</HI> How? Jesus Christ told his disciples, <HI>John</HI> 13.34. <HI>that ye love one another as I have loved you:</HI> How doth he manifest and we perceive his love to us? <HI>John</HI> 3.16. <HI>Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he said down his l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe for us, and we ought to lay down lives for the brethren; but whoso hath this world's goods, and seeth his brother have need, and shutt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th up his lowels from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</HI> When we see him, <HI>who was rich, for our sakes become poor, that we through his poverty, might be rich,</HI> it ought to ex∣cite us to lay aside prospects and endeavours to lay up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reasure on earth, and to engage us to lay down these gay prospects of life; for the bre∣thren to minister with liberality to them; to the necessities of the poor that are always lest with us, to prove the sincerity of our love: <HI>The poor ye have always with you; and whensoever ye will, ye may do then good;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> means are small, we ought to ply the greater diligenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

in our callings. For this very end, the gospel motives are; 1st of <HI>Thes∣salonians,</HI> 4 11, 12. <HI>That ye study to be quiet, and to do your own busi∣ness, and work with your own hands; that ye may walk honestly towards them that are without, and that ye may have lack of no man.</HI>—2d epistle, 3d chap. 11, 12 <HI>For we hear there are some which walk disorderly, work∣ing not at all; now such we command and exhort by our Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Jesus Christ, that with quietnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they work, and eat their own bread.—Ephesians,</HI> 4 28. <HI>But rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</HI> These are gospel motives.</P>
<P>Next the gospel exam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les. We have already hinted at the example of Jesus Christ, who went about doing good, healing the sick, reliev∣ing the afflicted, feeding the hungry; came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and give his life a ransom for many. We have the example of Paul, <HI>Acts</HI> 20 34. <HI>Yea, yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my necessities, and to them that are with me.</HI> The ex∣ample of Paul and his companions, 1st of <HI>Tressalonians.</HI> 2 9. <HI>For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travel; for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God</HI> And his exhortation to the Ephesian elders. <HI>Acts</HI> 20.35 <HI>I have shewed you all things how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2ly. Ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> obligations of submission to the will of God our saviour in what he alots to us in his providence. When we consider God is love, and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a design of love in all his dispensations towards us; if in his providence, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nity is wrote on our outward estate, we can't be brought to low, as he who was rich and became poor in love to us for our takes; and it is ordered by his wisdom, who knows what is most needful to subdue ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coveteousness and fondness for a hope in this life, and our pride of living independent, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="018215_0029_0FA5C11C13FBE7E0"/>If we imagine our honour is struck at in some things, that we say, flesh and blood can't bear, we cannot be so abased, as he who be∣ing in the form of God, and thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, was dispised and rejected, derided, blindfolded, buffeted, spit upon and suffered ignominy, till he could say as, <HI>Psalm</HI> 69.20. <HI>Reproach hath broken my heart</HI>—yet he failed not, nor was discouraged, but went through his undertaking, till he could say, <HI>it is finished</HI>; and hath in his wisdom and love, ordered this very circumstance to subdue our pride, and teach us our honour lies in denying ourselves and following him, in conformity to his example of meekness, who when he was reviled, reviled not again. And to his precepts, and the precepts of his apostles: <HI>But I say unto you, that ye resist not evil; but if any man smite thee on the one cheek, turn to him the other also: Recompence to no man evil for evil; be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</HI></P>
<P>If he is pleased to bereave us of relations, even those that had the chief place in our affections, it is ordered in wisdom and love by him, who gave his own life a ransom for us, and knows what we need, to cure us of idolizing them, and to shew us, that he alone, is our chief good—(a person who had repeatedly been bereaved, upon inquiring, what have I done, that I must be so afflicted; had his mouth stoped by this reply—what have you not done) for every Babel tower we build upon our children, <HI>to make us a name</HI>; every spreading gourd that our imaginations bring up in a night, of which we are exceeding glad—our towering imaginations of future greatness, and worldly hap∣piness in our relations, are all known to him, and he sees when it is necessary to take them from us; who corrects us for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.—If our troubles are greater than these, and we have living afflictions, and of long continuance in our relations, there is a history in <HI>Mark</HI> 5th, from 1st to the 19th, designed for the consolation of such relations.—<HI>Go home to thy friends, and tell them how great things Jesus hath done for thee, and had compas∣sion on thee</HI>—He is the same, and has the same designs in view, in his dispensations. The sickness of Lazarus was for the glory of God, that the son of God might be glorified thereby—The man was born blind, that the works of God should be made manifest in him; yea, a tribute of glory is arising to him who cast out seven devils from Mary Magdalen, and set the adulteress free, with direction to go and sin no more. If I could paint out greater affliction than any I have mention∣ed, it must be the distressed case of poor prodigal children, from their fathers houses, ladened with guilt, oppressed with shame, afflicted with a stubborn loathness to return, pinched with hunger, going with reluc∣tant steps towards the place where the swine are fed, to look for relief from thence.—Even this painting hath a bright side, when we consider that in all the distress into which their wilful, shameful folly hath plunged them; there is a design of love in over-ruling all this misery, as a means to bring them to themselves, and return them to their fa∣ther's house:—What, though they may not yet have come to this length, and are resolvedly guarding against this depth of distress and poverty that
<PB N="31" REF="018215_0030_0FA5C11CC90D7588"/>
hath been described;—though they chuse to continue in the way lead∣ing thereunto; there is this consolation, that <HI>every knee shall bow, and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of man shall be made low, and the Lord alone shall be exalted, and the idols he shall ut∣terly abolish.</HI></P>
<P>I would further say, we are the property of our Creator, Preserver and Redeemer, and obliged to glorify him in our spirits, and bodies, which are his; then surely, we are not our own, nor at our own disposal, and it is our indispensible duty to keep the place he allots, and do what he bids us, till he calls us away. To suppose our lives at our own dis∣posal, is a strong delusion to believe a lie; and as this delusion has ob∣tained in the minds of those that have professed a high sense of honour and honesty in their dealings among men, I would endeavour to shew, 1st. that it is the most contemptible sentiment that can be embraced— 2d. it is the most knavish and dishonest, beyond high-way robbery— 3dly. it is the most ungrateful:</P>
<P N="1">1st. The most contemptible, not only as it tends to brand the name and memory of a man from age to age among men, but first, as it is the evidence of murmuring and discontent with the allotments of a wise and kind providence, it is a delusion that has its rise from enmity to God.—2dly, As it tends to a foolish, fruitless attempt to run away from our rightful owner; I say, fruitless, because it is impossible, for <HI>If I ascend unto heaven, thou art there; If I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there: If I say, the darkness shall cover me, even the night shall be light about me; yea the darkness hideth not from thee, but the night shineth as the day; the darkness and the light both alike to thee.</HI>—And what is more foolish and contemptible than a runaway, who finally runs right into the hands of his master.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It Is the most knavish, as it tends to an attempt to rob God at once of all his property that is in our power.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. It is the most ungrateful, as it is directly contrary to all that love, grace and mercy, that is made manifest in the gospel, and to our duty consequent thereupon: <HI>For the grace of God, which bringeth salvation unto all men, hath appeared; teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, even the glorious appearing of the great God, even our saviour Jesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself, a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. A sense of obligation to gratitude and obedience, results from the belief of this truth; whoever knows it, knows they are not their own, but bought with a price, and under indisputable, indispensible, eternal obligations, to glorify God in their spirit and bodies, which are his. Then surely we ought always to keep our eye on his will, as our rule in all our actions, and look on our interest, our time, and all our talents, as his, and at his service, and be frequently enquiring of our∣selves, whether what we speak and do, is agreeable to the will of God in Christ Jesus, concerning us, agreeable to the exhortation, <HI>Collossians,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="018215_0031_0FA5C11D7B651FB8"/>
3.17. <HI>Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus.</HI> And whenever we act contrary thereto, we are guilty of base ingratitude.</P>
<P>What is worse than to call a man ungrateful? Yet black as it is, we are guilty of it every time we harken to the temptations of satan, and walk after our own lusts. What can be conceived of, so ungrateful, as when the grace of God, that bringeth salvation to all men, hath ap∣peared, instead of harkening to what it teaches, men curse and damn one another, bite and devour one another?</P>
<P>When he feeds and cloaths us, the tendency of our hearts is, <HI>to make empty the soul of the hungry, and cause the drink of the thirsty to fail, de∣vising wicked devices, with lying words even when the needy speaketh right. Isaiah</HI> 32.6, 7. O our ingratitude! <HI>The ox knoweth his owner and the ass his master's crib; but my people doth not know Israel doth not consider. Isaiah</HI> 1.3. But is there hope for us? Yes; 1st of <HI>John,</HI> 3 5. <HI>And ye know that he was manifest to take away our sins.</HI> 1st of <HI>John,</HI> 3 8. <HI>For this purpose the son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</HI> Well may we cry out with the prophet <HI>Micah,</HI> 7.18, 19. <HI>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sseth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger forever, because he delighteth in mercy: He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will subdue our iniquities; and thou will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</HI> Yea, saith God, by the prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> chap. 44.22. <HI>I have blotted out as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and as a cloud thy sins,</HI> and calls upon us to <HI>return, for I have redeemed thee.</HI></P>
<P>Surely then we are called, 4thly, to thanksgiving. <HI>Isaiah</HI> 44 23. <HI>Sing, O ye he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vens, for the Lord hath done it: Shout ye lower part<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the earth: break forth into singing ye mountains, O forest. and every tree therein: for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.</HI></P>
<P>This is a subject that would lead our minds from eternity to eternity, back to the source and fountain of mercy, which the apostle <HI>John</HI> speaks of, when he says, <HI>God is love;</HI> and forward to the fruit of the purchase of Jesus Christ, the reward of his righteousness, to <HI>the hope laid up in heaven,</HI> to what <HI>eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard, nor hath entered into the heart of man to conceive</HI>: For which all the dispensations of providence are over-ruled in the present life; which, if rightly under∣stood, would lead the mind to an understanding of that exhortation to the disciples, 1st of <HI>Thessalonians</HI> 5.19. <HI>In every thing give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus, concerning you.</HI> But as this opens a large field, and I have already been more lengthy than I intended, I shall close with that short, comprehensive exhortation, we have in psalm CXVII. <HI>O praise the Lord all ye nations; Praise him all ye people, for his merciful kindness is great towards us, and the truth of the Lord forever: Praise ye the Lord.</HI></P>
