<P>A POEM Occasioned by the spreading in this Province the Result of a <HI>Consociation</HI> in a Neighbour Government; being a private Christian's Dissent from, and Testimony against, that unscriptural and dangerous Opinion which seems to prevail under the Umbrage of that Result, viz. <HI>That the Minister of each Town or Pa∣rish has a POWER to license or forbid the preaching of the Gospel by any other than himself in the Parish whereof he is Minister— And this tho' (as the same Result says) he be</HI> really <HI>an</HI> unconverted Man.</P>

<LG>
<L>ENVY tho' one of the most hateful Evils</L>
<L>And bearing near Resemblance to the Devils,</L>
<L>Must needs confess, unless its deadly Hate</L>
<L>All Sense and Reason doth obliterate,</L>
<L>That Works of Wonder have of late been wrought,</L>
<L>And Multitudes in th' Gospel Net been caught,</L>
<L>Of Ministers and People too much drowsing,</L>
<L>'Till Joggs from <HI>Whitefield</HI> prov'd a happy rousing.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>[II.]</HEAD>
<L>DEad Souls secure and in their Graves of Sin,</L>
<L>Have heard the Gospel and CHRIST's Voice therein;</L>
<L>From Beds of Sloth, from Graves of Unbelief,</L>
<L>By Terrors rous'd, in Christ have found Relief.</L>
<L>And when (with <HI>Philip)</HI> they have JESUS found</L>
<L>Can't but commend him unto all around:</L>
<L>His lovely Face, when graciously reveal'd▪</L>
<L>Creates a Joy which cannot be conceal'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>[III.]</HEAD>
<L>WHile doleful Night of Horror passed on</L>
<L>Their sinking Souls, their Hope was almost gone,</L>
<L>And black Despair did well nigh overwhelm,</L>
<L>Till Faith discover'd Jesus at the Helm:</L>
<L>Will any wonder then at strange Expressions</L>
<L>Of Fears and Joys produc'd by deep Impressions</L>
<L>In Matters of eternal Consequence,</L>
<L>Fix'd on the Soul, by th' Spirit's Influence?</L>

<L>ALtho' uncommon, seeming out of Season,</L>
<L>Or for a Time suspending Acts of Reason,</L>
<L>While (with the Jaylor) they a trembling fall</L>
<L>Or to the Ground are stricken down (with <HI>Paul)</HI></L>
<L>And when reviv'd, transported with the Rays</L>
<L>Of heavenly Light, their Lips are fill'd with Praise,</L>
<L>And elevated Minds take no Repose</L>
<L>In earthly Objects, that may interpose.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>[V.]</HEAD>
<L>RAther than wonder how these Things can be</L>
<L>I wonder at my own Stupidity,</L>
<L>And wish and long such mighty Power to feel</L>
<L>As on my Soul may deep Impressions seal,</L>
<L>And join with such as far as I am able</L>
<L>Who think this Work divine and admirable,</L>
<L>And honour those (altho' Itinerants)</L>
<L>Who have herein been happy Instruments.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>[VI.]</HEAD>
<L>DO any say this Work is meer Delusion,</L>
<L>And all such Preaching tends to breed Confusion,</L>
<L>And (without Leave) a manifest Disorder</L>
<L>For one to preach within another's Border?</L>
<L>When this is prov'd from Scripture I will mind it,</L>
<L>But at the present know not where to find it;</L>
<L>And rather think if any find such Clause,</L>
<L>It must be 'mongst some Antichristian Laws.</L>

<L>GReat <HI>William</HI> finding such a penal Act</L>
<L>As did Imprisonments and Fines exact</L>
<L>For such like Crimes; the Edict did revoke</L>
<L>And freed his Subjects from that Iron Yoke:</L>
<L>And his Successors on the <HI>British</HI> Throne</L>
<L>That persecuting Act do still disown:</L>
<L>Christ's preached Truth the Subjects now receive</L>

<L>ORder and Peace, by GOD himself ordain'd,</L>
<L>Ought in the Scripture Sense to be maintain'd;</L>
<L>Their sovereign Author never did design</L>
<L>Them Instruments his Truth to undermine,</L>
<L>Or that one Truth should 'gainst another dash,</L>
<L>Or Peace and Order with the Gospel clash;</L>
<L>Yet persecuting Spirits make their Claims</L>
<L>From Age to Age, under those lovely Names.</L>

<LG N="9">
<HEAD>[IX.]</HEAD>
<L>DId Christ or his Apostles ever teach</L>
<L>That Men commission'd in his Name to preach,</L>
<L>Must of their Fellow Mortals Leave obtain,</L>
<L>Else (to avoid Disorder) must refrain?</L>
<L>Or where have they restrictive Bounds assign'd</L>
<L>Of Time or Place to preach or hear his Mind?</L>
<L>Or can it grieve an holy faithful Pastor</L>
<L>If other Workmen drive his Nails yet faster.</L>

<L>DID <HI>Paul</HI> rejoice when Christ was preach'd by those</L>
<L>Who envy'd him: and vainly did suppose</L>
<L>Their doing so, would rather make him sad</L>
<L>And to his Bonds a sore Affliction add.</L>
<L>And did our Saviour Christ himself express</L>
<L>Dislike that his Disciples should suppress</L>
<L>The casting out of Devils in his Name</L>
<L>Tho' they pretend Disorder in the same.</L>

<L>AND shall not all true Christians who inherit</L>
<L>A Part and Portion in the self same Spirit</L>
<L>Rejoice to see Christ's Name exalted high</L>
<L>Tho' in the Dust their own may seem to lie.</L>
<L>Accept their Labours very thankfully</L>
<L>(Tho' Strangers) preaching Christ incessantly,</L>
<L>Whose Love to Christ and Souls inspires with Zeal</L>
<L>To wound poor Sinners, and their Wounds to heal.</L>

<L>REligion drown'd in dull Formality,</L>
<L>And Gospel Grace in Sensuality,</L>
<L>Lately reviv'd, deserves our chiefest Cares,</L>
<L>For still we walk, 'midst dangerous Pits and Snares,</L>
<L>'Twill be our Safety closely to adhere</L>
<L>To th' holy Scriptures, and rejoice with Fear:</L>
<L>Satan no doubt will all his Force imploy,</L>
<L>With utmost Craft and Assiduity.</L>

<LG N="13">
<HEAD>[XIII.]</HEAD>
<L>DEceitful Heart, misguided Zeal will join,</L>
<L>And numerous Clans of hurtful Lusts combine</L>
<L>This Work (if possible) to nullify,</L>
<L>Or cover with some dark Obscurity;</L>
<L>Or bloody Persecution may ensue</L>
<L>To try the Faith of such whose Faith is true:</L>
<L>Or (worse than so) GOD's SPIRIT may surcease</L>
<L>And Things be hid, which most concern our Peace.</L>
