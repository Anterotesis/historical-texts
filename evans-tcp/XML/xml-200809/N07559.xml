<HEAD>PLAIN TRUTH, Address'd to the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>AT a Time when we seem to be rent in Pieces by PARTY SPIRIT and PARTY RAGE, I think it a Duty incumbent on every good Subject to make diligent Search, in order to find out the Agressors, and then to in∣form the Public how he has found Matters to stand; that so common Opinions may be confirm'd or refuted, and the Saddle at last be put on the right Horse, and Peace again restored among us.</P>
<P>FIRST THEN, Let us consider the Paxton Voluntiers, and others, against whom some make such an Outcry:— Shall we attempt to vindicate their killing Indians under the Protection of the Government? By no Means. The Fact is to be condemn'd as unlawful; but though we would not vindicate their Conduct in every Respect, is it not the Duty of every good Man impartially to consider what have been the Circumstances of those People, and what they suffered to provoke them to this desperate and unlawful Act?</P>
<P>Would not this Course discover more of that meek and christian Spirit, which some People so much profess and
<PB N="4" REF="009646_0004_0F773A3284BA3868"/>
so little exercise? Nay, do not Candor, Piety, and Jus∣tice require that we should admit of every alleviating Cir∣cumstance in their Favour, rather than take so much Pains (as many do) to aggravate their Crime, and make bad ap∣pear worse?</P>
<P>THESE Incendiaries are not only enraged themselves, at their dear Friends, the Indians, being slain, but would have all the Rest of the World of their Temper;—To ob∣tain which End, they have wrote and publish'd several in∣flamatory Pamphlets, asserting many falsehoods, with a Design to enrage the Populace against these poor distressed, though rash People.—Go but into the House of a Quaker, and before you have Time to discover what you came for, he will ask you, with an affected Meekness, "Hast thee seen the Massacre of the Indians at Lancaster?"—A Pam∣phlet well known to be wrote by one of their zealous Friends, in Order to swell the Current of Prejudices against the aforesaid People.</P>
<P>I shou'd be glad to see the Massacre of the Back Inha∣bitants drawn by the same able Hand, provided he would do it with the same Zeal in their Favour, and against the Savage Indian Butchers, as I'm confident he could have a much more affecting Subject to handle, and fill every Imagination with Horror.—None of those killed at Lancaster were by Design kept one Moment in Torment; whereas many of our Frontier Inhabitants have been wan∣tonly kept whole Days and Nights in exquisite Tortures, prolong'd and heighten'd with all the Contrivances infernal Malice could suggest before those Savages (whose Cause and Interest Quakers so warmly espouse) would vouchsafe to give the merciful finishing Blow!</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="009646_0005_0F773A34841359A8"/>TERRIBLE! indeed beyond Description, are the Cruel∣ties daily practised by those Savages on our Fellow Sub∣jects, while Prisoners amongst them! But where are the Quakers who have taken up Arms to defend them? Where are the Quakers who have sympathized with them, or pi∣tied their Distresses? Let their Christian Conduct since the Commencement of the War declare.—</P>
<P>WHEN the Indian Incursions last Summer laid waste a considerable Part of our Frontier, by which near a thou∣sand Families were drove from their Places, reduced to the utmost Poverty, and thrown upon the Public-Charity for the Support of their miserable Lives.— How did these <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> merciful, compassionate Quakers (who would seem to monopolize Christian Charity, and all the Tenderness of human Nature amongst themselves) behave on so melan∣choly an Occasion?—To their immortal Infamy be it known, that when every other religious Society in the Ci∣ty, even the Roman Catholicks, whom they so much de∣spise, (tho' saddled at the Time with the heavy Expence of building a Chapel) were sensibly affected with the Dis∣tresses of the poor unhappy Sufferers, and promoted very generous and liberal Contributions for their Relief and Sup∣port, These compassionate and merciful Christians, so ea∣sily affected with Pity for Indians, would not grant a sin∣gle Farthing (as a Society) for the Relief of their Fellow Subjects. Tho' Justice requires we should exempt from this Odium a few worthy Individuals in the City, who contributed on the Occasion; as also a few others in the Town and Neighbourhood of Lancaster, who raised about Thirty Pounds for the same Purpose.</P>
<P>WHEREAS when their Good Brethren the Indians (some of whom were well known by Officers now in the City, to
<PB N="6" REF="009646_0006_0F773A354D2E4480"/>
have been in the Battle against Col. BOQUET; and others at the Siege of Fort Pitt, during the Summer) seem'd to be in Danger of receiving their just Deserts from the Hands of a bereft and injured People, no Toils or Fa∣tigues by Night or Day are thought too great, nor no Ex∣pence too much to protect these Bosom Friends. Nay, their very fundamental Principles of Non-Resistance, which would never before bend in Defence of King or Country, are chearfully sacrificed on the interesting. Occa∣sion, as a Compliment to perfidious Savages.</P>
<P>THE PAXTON PEOPLE'S coming down armed, in a seem∣ingly hostile Manner, is also justly to be condemned, —But whilst we condemn particular Facts, let us not misrepresent the general Characters of these People.</P>
<P>LET it be considered, that they had, long before, sent several Petitions to the Governor and Assembly, which, its suppos'd, have been conceal'd by some ill designing persons: And tho' his Honour never receiv'd these Re∣monstrances, yet the distress'd People believ'd he had, and look'd upon themselves as utterly neglected and their suf∣ferings despis'd by the Government.</P>
<P>Now let any candid Person consider this Circum∣stance, added to their numberless other Distresses, and he will certainly admit such an Apology for their Extrava∣gancies as the wise SOLOMON suggests, that "Oppressi∣on will make a wise Man mad."—And have not all Nations and Generations found it so, that when People have been driven to Desperation by Oppression, they have broken thro' all Obstacles to right themselves, if at all in their Power:—Nay, is not the happy and glorious REVOLUTION, by which our civil and religious Rights, as
<PB N="7" REF="009646_0007_0F773A35951FE9C8"/>
ENGLISHMEN and PROTESTANTS, were secured on their present Footing, a striking Instance of this known truth?</P>
<P>WHAT these People intended by their coming down arm'd let themselves declare. I only observe, that the Manner of their Behaviour when they came, did them Honour; as it shew'd them to be brave, loyal and discreet.</P>
<P>THEY sent in a Memorial to the Governor, which was deliver'd by a Member of the Assembly (tho' it has since been falsely asserted, that they never had a Notion of Remostrating, till they saw how Things stood when they came to Germantown) setting forth their Grievances, and begging Redress; at the same Time giving Assurance that they did not intend to do the least Injury to any of their fellow Subjects. And that they were sincere in this Declaration their Conduct has sufficiently prov'd. They let his Honour know that by such a Time they wou'd be at Germantown, and there halt till he was pleas'd to give them an Answer.—It was then propos'd, by Gentlemen of Candour and Humanity, to send out Delegates to treat with those People: But this was warmly oppos'd by some of the People call'd Quakers, who spoke to this Effect.
<Q>That they had Force sufficient to kill the whole, and tho' some of the Citizens shou'd lose their Lives, it was better so than condescend to treat with such a Banditti.</Q></P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS the Gentlemen's Opinion, who were more averse to shedding the Blood of their fellow Subjects than the meek, peaceful, inspir'd Quakers, did prevail; and the Day following some Gentlemen of unexceptiona∣ble Character, went to Germantown, and had a Meeting with Delegates from the Paxton Voluntiers. But instead of finding them a senseless rude and lawless Banditti, they found them a well behav'd and orderly People who avowed
<PB N="8" REF="009646_0008_0F773A3649B32B68"/>
(and I believe very sincerely) the greatest Loyalty to his Majesty, and Love to their Country. They were willing to disperse and return to their respective Homes, provided their Grievances might have a fair Hearing, which was ac∣cordingly agreed to. Persons were appointed by them to attend for that purpose, and they accordingly dispers'd without doing any the least Mischief. They have indeed charg'd the People call'd Quakers with gross partiality to Indians, and their being unfit for Government: Nay they ascribe the greatest part of their sufferings to them alone. And that Quakers have been partial, and shown more real Affection for Enemy Savages than for their fellow Sub∣jects, of certain Denominations, is so well known in this Province, and has on the present Occasion been so fully demonstrated to the World, that I should deem it Loss of Time to say any more on so recent and glaring a Fact: Whether the Affection which some Principals of that Sect have shewn to Indians, and the great Care they are now taking of them can possibly be owing to the Charms of their Squaws, to any particular Advantages that may a∣rise from their Trade, or perhaps rather from the Use they have made of them to asperse the Proprietaries and oppose their Interests, may be considered as a vain Question, which I will not undertake to determine. But this is certain, that there is not the least Probability that any of these In∣dians will ever stand as Candidates for Seats in the Assem∣bly, and it is probable some of the Paxton Voluntiers may, if such as bid fairest shou'd not be murdered by some of the Savages now in our Custody. Therefore it might seem Policy, agreeable to some Quakers, not to afford them that Protection, nor shew them that Regard they at this Time shew the Savages.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009646_0009_0F773A3768E82330"/>LET us impartially next consider Quakers with Respect to Government:—Can it be consistent that a Person who declares that his Conscience by divine Inspiration forbids him to have any Hand in shedding Blood, should be intrus∣ted as a Representative for People who look on themselves to be obliged by the Laws of God, the Laws of Nature and the Laws of their King and Country to take up Arms to defend themselves, and punish those who would deprive them of Life or Property? Nay, is it not an inexpressible Absurdity that a warlike People should be governed by Persons of Quaker Principles, and especially in Time of War.—Yet that great Numbers of such have long been Members of our Assembly is too true, and that they have often spent their Time in debating, whilst our poor Fron∣tier Inhabitants, have been Suffering is also Truth. And tho' they have at last voted Men and Money for warlike Uses, it was not until they found they could no longer keep their Places of Honour and Trust without doing so. But at the same Time they have done every Thing in their Power to prevent any of their own Sect taking up Arms in Defence of their Country; and if at any Time any of their young Men took up Arms against our common Ene∣my, they were sure to be excommunicated, which they call reading out of Meeting.— And is it not certain, that when their King and Country call them to Arms, they plead Conscience, and will tell thee, with a pious Air, and meek Countenance, "they would rather perish by the Sword than use it against the Enemies of the State.— But if any of their Fellow Subjects become obnoxious to their mild and peaceful Rage, by opposing any of their arbitrary Measures, we then see the Quaker unmask'd, with his Gun upon his Shoulder, and other warlike Habiliments,
<PB N="10" REF="009646_0010_0F773A37CBEFC170"/>
eagerly desiring the Combat, and thirsting for the Blood of those his Opponents.</P>
<P>AND here let me observe, that the very People whom the Quakers took up Arms to destroy, were those who protected their Lives and Properties, whilst these ungrate∣ful People sat unmolested in their Houses, and were pre∣served from feeling the Severities and Contrivances of In∣dian Cruelty.</P>
<P>'TIS owing to the brave Stand which these unrequited Voluntiers have made against the Inroads of Savages, that the Quakers are now able to treat their Protectors with such Ingratitude.— No Excommunications now for taking up Arms!— Behold the Meeting-House converted into a Place of Arms!—No Preaching nor Praying heard there, but the beating of Drums, and confused clashing of Arms, by Men who knew not how to use them. Whilst some of their Preachers are busied in procuring Powder and Shot, others are employed in refreshing the Spirit of their brave Soldiers with Wine and other Liquors.— And are these the People who are taught by immediate Inspiration that it is a heinous Crime to fight? What amazing Hypocrisy ap∣pears in their Profession! They must either confess that they have hitherto resisted the Holy Spirit, or impiously assert that the Spirit has changed his Mind, and now di∣rects them to War and Blood, contradictory to his for∣mer Inspirations.— But this is to blaspheme God and be∣lie the Holy Ghost, yet such is their Conduct!</P>
<P>BUT one of these pious Quakers might here say,
<Q>Thee art mistaken Friend;— It is true, we profess to have an Aversion to War: But this, with most of us, is from Policy rather than Principle. Nay we secretly rejoice when we hear of whole Settlements murdered and de∣stroyed.
<PB N="11" REF="009646_0011_0F773A3891CFB140"/>
And don't thee consider that the Destruc∣tion of the Back Inhabitants lessens a growing Party against us; whilst we are prospering and thriving on the Fat of the Land: And tho' our Malice at present is openly pointed only at the Presbyterians; yet to be plain with thee, we are as much in our Hearts again all who differ from us in Opinion: And can thee blame us for seeking the Overthrow of all that oppose the good Schemes of the faithful? But thee knows it would be impolitic to discover our Resentment to too many Sects at once, for by so doing we might endanger our∣selves and our Affairs.</Q>
I think there can be only one Objection to such a Declaration from a Man call'd a Qua∣ker, and that is, it would be acting with more Openness and Honesty than is generally found amongst them.</P>
<P>BUT it may be ask'd, Why all this Clamour against Qua∣kers! Surely they don't solely govern. True, Thank God they do not: But if a few artful bad Men in the Ad∣ministration may be very detrimental, what may we ap∣prehend where so many Quakers are intrusted, who have lately prov'd their very Religion to be a political Engine, to which they themselves pay no conscientious Regard, but as it suits their crafty Purposes.</P>
<P>IT was the Observation of Constantius, Father to Con∣stantine the great, that, "they who were false to their "God, would never be true to their Prince." Upon which he discarded the Pagans whom he had prov'd to be ready to embrace any Religion indifferently, and employ∣ed the Christians, who firmly adhered to their Profession.</P>
<P>LET us look round and see who are those who enjoy the Places of Profit and Trust in this Province; (a very few excepted) are they not Quakers or Quaker's Creatures
<PB N="12" REF="009646_0012_0F773A3998624388"/>
and was it not from Policy more than Justice, I doubt not they would long e'er now have monopoliz'd the whole to themselves.</P>
<P>IT has been argued, if the Indians are guilty, let their Accusers appear, and not put them to Death without a fair Trial.— Indeed it is a hard Matter to prove an Indian guilty, unless he was taken in the Fact; for to Day they are painted red, To-morrow blue, and the next Day any other Colour that they think will best prevent their being known; But tho' hard, it is not impossible with Respect to some.— It is certified that a Dutch Woman, now in the Jerseys, and her little Daughter, seeing the Gang of Indians now in our Barracks, passing thro' that Province, knew the very Persons with whom they were Prisoners.— But it has been proved, by a very circumstantial Oath of a young Man, (who has since very unaccountably disap∣peared) that the Quakers, or Persons who appeared to be such, have conveyed off and concealed those that were most suspected.—If this be true, are not they the People who despise the Laws of their Country, and fly in the Face of Government, by stopping the Course of public Justice? Believe me my Countrymen, those who will shelter and conceal a Murderer, would perpetrate a Mur∣der, and suborn or suppress an Evidence.</P>
<P>FROM what has been said, I hope my Countrymen will coolly consider whether Quakers are fit to be their Repre∣sentatives or not, after such glaring and positive Proofs of their Insincerity; and whether we ought to continue to en∣trust them with our Lives and Liberties: But I do not speak of them all, nor condemn the Lump; I do not doubt but there are good Men amongst them, Men who would not hold the least Part in Government for all the
<PB N="13" REF="009646_0013_0F773A3A147096F8"/>
Wealth in the Province.—To govern, is absolutely re∣pugnant to the avowed Principles of Quakers: Therefore if they are conscientious Men, they will not undertake it, and if they are not so, surely we should not trust them.— Can any Man of Sense believe that a conscientious Quaker will lay hold of any Part of the Reins that govern a Peo∣ple engaged in Wars, and at the same Time declare, that from Conscience he can have no Hand in War? It is true, every man has Liberty to profess his Belief, nor should any be forced to act contrary to it; I only contend for People's adhereing strictly to what they Profess, and that those who do not should be looked upon as Deceivers of Men, and therefore not fit to be entrusted.</P>
<P>THAT Peace and Truth may be promoted, that Justice may be practised, and that the Hypocrite reign not, least the Peple be ensnared, is the Desire of</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE I wrote the foregoing, I have had the Pleasure of see∣ing in print the DECLARATION and REMONSTRANCE of the Frontier-Counties. From thence it is evident, That the People have long suffered great Hardships, and with as much Patience as any of their Neighbours would have done, the Quakers by no Means excepted; who have, on every Occasion, manifested much greater Impatience, and less Fortitude of Spirit, if only their political Schemes have been vigorously oppos'd.</P>
<P>IT will appear that the Frontier Inhabitants have been both loyal and peaceable Members of Society, and do not now plead for Favours, but Justice; nor strive for Pre-emi∣nence, but their essential Rights, and a moderate Equality.</P>
<P>AND I presume it will be obvious, that whoever endeavours to oppress and deprive them of their Rights, act partially, and maliciously, and aim to drive them to Extremities, then ac∣cuse them of what they, in a Manner, forced them to do, and, it would seem, desired they might do.—Let but real Grievances, such as none can pretend to deny, be removed; and let plain Justice be done, and the People will be quiet and peaceable Members of the Community as hereto∣fore.</P>
<P>IN a Word, let but all just Causes of complaint be taken a∣way, and then let them be punish'd if they make a Noise
<PB N="15" REF="009646_0015_0F773A3D07EB38C0"/>
without Cause; and all sensible Men will approve the Severity.—But—to provoke, and then punish them, as it were for that Provocation, raises Compassion for them even in the Midst of their Extravagancies, and Resentment against the wilful Oppressors.</P>
<P>TO talk against Presbyterians as such, on this Occasion, is the Effect either of Malice and Party Spirit, or Nonsense; for tho' they happened to be generally Presbyterians who were so abused and injured, yet Principles of BRITISH LIBERTY and the Sense or Sentiments of Nature alone, not of Presbyterinism, or any other Denomination, breath in their Remonstrance and Petition.—Let any cool Jud∣ges, before they pass Sentence, imagine themselves to be in the very same Circumstances, and then think how they would feel? and let such as observe how a just Resentment is apt to transport their own Minds, and cause them, on less Occasions, to go beyond proper Rules—at least excuse, tho' not approve some unguarded Actions of an injured People.</P>
