<HEAD>An Epistle to the READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Ingenuous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have here a Specimen of the Cloggs &amp; Fetters with which the Liberty of <HI>Dissenters</HI> are intangled at <HI>New-York</HI> and <HI>Jersey Governments</HI> beyond any places in Her <HI>Majesties Dominions;</HI> And when the Conditions, and Impositions required, are as heavy, and uneasy to be bore; and as great a <HI>Scruple of Conscience,</HI> as the grounds of their Separation and Dis∣sent, it is next to no Liberty at all.</P>
<P>And what the Consequences of such practices, if persisted in, will prove to such a Place, where <HI>Dissenters</HI> are above twenty to one, for one Church-man, and where men and money are so much wanting, for the defence of <HI>New-York,</HI> both by Sea and Land, which not many years, (by demands of men and money from the Neighbouring Colo∣nies on the Continent) was represented, as their only Barrier and Frontier, I leave to thinking men, and considering Politicians to an∣swer; besides the difficulties and discouragements laid in the way of such as would Import themselves, and the ready and shortest way to promote Deserters from those Provinces.</P>
<P>I cannot omit a true, and <HI>strange Story,</HI> I lately heard of, that during the Imprisonment of these two <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> either to find out a <HI>Crime,</HI> none being specifyed in the <HI>Mittimus,</HI> or to aggavate their imaginary fault: An Order was given to Major <HI>Sandford</HI> of <HI>East-Jersey,</HI> to put sun∣dry persons upon Examination, and their Oaths, to discover what Dis∣course they had with sundry of their friends, at the House of Mr. <HI>Jasper Crane</HI> in <HI>New-York</HI>-Town in <HI>East-Jersey,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Samuel Melyen,</HI> Mr. <HI>Crane</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd another, gave their Depositions before Major <HI>Sandford,</HI> but found nothing to their purpose: Tho the practice is not to be out∣done, yea, scarce paralelled by <HI>Spanish Inquisition;</HI> for no men are safe in their most private Conversations, if most intimate Friends can be compelled upon Oath, to betray one anothers Secrets. If this is agrea∣ble
<PB REF="001300_0003_0FB27B225CEEC0E8"/>
to <HI>English Constitution</HI> and Priviledges, I confess, we have been hi∣therto in the Dark.</P>
<P>Preaching in a Private House was a <HI>Crime,</HI> and Preaching since, after being declared <HI>Not Guilty</HI> by a Legal Tryal, in a Publick Church, allowed by Law to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rench,</HI> is since resented as a <HI>greater,</HI> by that Unchristian Clamour, made soon after, by some <HI>High-flown</HI> Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> pretended <HI>Sons</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> who with a great deal of unbounded fury declared, If such things were allowed, their Church was ruined: Which is a language of the same nature of those <HI>High-Flyers</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> who were declared by a Vote of the House of Lords, Enemies to the QUEEN and Government, for suggesting, the Church of <HI>England</HI> was in danger, from the <HI>Liberty,</HI> or <HI>Toleration</HI> of <HI>Dissenters.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' Preaching a Sermon, and Printing it as the cause of Imprison∣ment, be reputed a Libel, to justifie opening of Letters, and seizing Books, without restoration or satisfaction. I hope it will be no crime, for <HI>Losers</HI> to <HI>speak,</HI> in telling the World, what we have suffered on sun∣dry accounts; not only by Imprisonment, and the exorbi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt expen∣sive prosecution; and besides great loss of time, many diminitive re∣proaches upon our Reputations, by a <HI>Set of men</HI> who could reach by their <HI>Short Horns</HI> to no higher degree of Persecution: And all this for Preaching one Sermon, without obtaining a Licence, which they could not, <HI>in terminis</HI> submit to, neither can nor dare in Conscience do to this day.</P>
<P>And even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such as have this new moulded Licence, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Crime</HI> to Preach in another place then is expressed in said Licence▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for any to Preach in their Pulpits: if a People wants a Minister, they must have a Licence to call one, whither from <HI>New-England</HI> or <HI>Europe,</HI> a Licence to admit Ministers to attend any Ordination, and limited for number, and tyed up from exercising their Ministry without Licence, tho' in a transient manner, which has drove some out of the Govern∣ment, and deterred others from coming thereunto; which informs all, what <HI>Liberty of Conscience</HI> Dissenters do enjoy.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Makemie</HI> since the <HI>Tryal,</HI> narrowly escaped a second Prosecution, for Preaching another Sermon: as some say, with a new Charge of be∣ing the Author of the <HI>Jersey</HI> Paper called, <HI>FORGET</HI> and <HI>FORGIVE;</HI> which is so groundless a Charge, in which his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not believe themselves, while the Authors smile at the mist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> men are suffering Imprisonment on account of said Paper, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll appear to
<PB REF="001300_0004_0FB27B242E8C90A0" MS="y"/>
have been composed before Mr. <HI>Makemie</HI> came into these Parts.</P>
<P>This <HI>Narrative</HI> consists chiefly of these parts for matter. (1.) Their Precepts for their Apprehending, and Commitment. (2.) Sundry Pe∣titions. (3.) The Interlocutory Conference, promoted and extorted from Mr. <HI>Makemie.</HI> (4.) Copies of Records, attested by Mr. Secretary. (5.) The Pleadings of the Defendant and Lawyers, with some Inter∣mixt Animadversions, and Glosses upon those as the Text. If the Pub∣lisher is mistaken in his sense of things, he is under the Correction of all Judicious, Impartial, and Unprejudiced Persons, whom he readily submits unto.</P>
<P>If any want Information concerning the Sufferings of other Dissen∣ters, both in their Persons, Estates, and Religious Liberties; I Recom∣commend to the Body of Inhabitants of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and <HI>New-Town</HI> on <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and <HI>Bedford</HI> in <HI>WestChester;</HI> the former affraid to Petition, tho' one of them has a Minister by a <HI>during-Pleasure</HI> Licence: And the late Petition of <HI>Bedford,</HI> for Calling a Minister, is not yet answered, until an Abdicated <HI>Scotch Jacobite</HI> Parson, obtruded upon them, that insults in∣tollerably over them, is consulted with. And how consistent such things are even with the <HI>Liberty of Conscience,</HI> enjoined and commanded to be allowed by the Queens Instructions produced in Court, and to be found in this Narrative, I leave to every Reader to determine.</P>
<CLOSER>So I bid you farewel.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>A <HI>Particular Narrative</HI> of the Imprisonment of two <HI>Non conformist Ministers;</HI> and <HI>Pro∣secution</HI> or <HI>Tryal</HI> of one of them, for Preaching a SERMON in the City of <HI>New-York.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing more common in <HI>Europe,</HI> then Publish∣ing and Printing most Tryals, especially such as afford any thing remarkable, either from the <HI>Merit of the Cause,</HI> or <HI>Manner of Prosecution.</HI> And there being something <HI>Singular</HI> and <HI>Extraordinary,</HI> in sundry respects, in the <HI>Cause</HI> now before us; we cannot, we dare not, be silent at this juncture, but bound to let both <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America</HI> know, the first Prosecution of this nature, that ever was in <HI>America;</HI> which we hope, from the <HI>Merit of the Cause, manner of Proceeding,</HI> and <HI>unsuccessfulness,</HI> shall never be drawn into <HI>President,</HI> in our quiet and peaceable Wilderness.</P>
<P>And tho' there was a disappointment, in taking an exact Copy of every thing offered at the Tryal, and so no accurate, or strictly <HI>Formal Tryal,</HI> can be expected, especially from One who is no Lawyer; but only a brief <HI>Narrative</HI> and Genuine <HI>History</HI> of the several steps of suffer∣ing, by the Confinement of <HI>Francis Makemie,</HI> and <HI>John Hampton, Presby∣terian Ministers,</HI> for Preaching two Sermons in the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> without <HI>Licence</HI> being first obtained of Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> for so doing; the <HI>former</HI> upon the earnest request of certain persons in the City of <HI>York,</HI> Preached a Sermon at the House of <HI>William Jackson,</HI> in <HI>Pearl</HI>-street, on the 20th day of <HI>January,</HI> 1706, 7. in as <HI>publick a manner</HI> as possible, with open doors; which Sermon is since Printed; which he was necessitated to do, seeing Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> opposed his Preaching in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Church; and the <HI>latter</HI> Preached a <HI>Sermon</HI> on the same day in a Publick Meeting-House, offered to Record by the Inhabitants of <HI>New-Town</HI> upon <HI>Long-Island.</HI></P>

<P>AND being late when Apprehended, they were <HI>Prisoners upon Parole,</HI> at the Houses of two Neighbours for that night, and next day, instead of carrying them to Fort-<HI>Anne,</HI> according to the directions of said <HI>Precept,</HI> they were carried by said Sheriffs to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> seven or eight miles out of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r direct way to <HI>York,</HI> and there detained all that day &amp; night; as if they were to be carried about in <HI>Triumph</HI> to be <HI>insulted</HI> over, as <HI>Exemplary Criminals,</HI> and put to further Charge. The 23d day about Noon, they were carried to Fort-<HI>Anne</HI> in <HI>York;</HI> and after sundry hours attendance, appeared before Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> in the Council-Chamber, a∣bout three or 4 of the Clock, who charged them with taking upon them to Preach in his Government without his Licence.</P>
<P>And in regard the <HI>Interlocutory Conference</HI> upon that Occasion, which continued for some time, has been misrepresented by sundry hands, and

<P><HI>How dare you take upon you to Preach in my Government, without my Licence?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Makemie.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have Liberty from an <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> made the First Year of the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> which gave us Liberty, with which Law we have complied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld. C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>None shall Preach in my Government without my Licence?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the <HI>Law</HI> for <HI>Liberty,</HI> my Lord, had directed us to any parti∣cular persons in Authority for Licence, we would readily have observ∣ed the same; but we cannot find any directions in said <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> therefore could not take notice thereof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld. C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>That Law does not extend to the</HI> American <HI>Plantations, but only to</HI> England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I humbly conceive, it is not a <HI>limited</HI> nor <HI>local</HI> Act, and am well assured, it extends to other Plantations of the Queens Do∣minions, which is evident from <HI>Certificates</HI> from <HI>Courts of Record</HI> of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> certifying we have complied with said Law.</P>
<P>Both <HI>Certificates</HI> were produced and read by Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> who was pleased to say, these Certificates extended not to <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld. C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I know it is</HI> local <HI>and</HI> limited, <HI>for I was at making thereof.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Excellency might be at making thereof, but we are well assured, there is no such <HI>limiting cause</HI> therein, as is in <HI>Local Acts,</HI> and desire the Law may be produced to determine this point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld. C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Turning to Mr. Attorney, Mr.</HI> Bekely, <HI>who was present, ask'd him,</HI> Is it not so, Mr. Attorney?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Attorney.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes, it is</HI> Local <HI>my Lord, and producing an Argument for it,</HI> further said, <HI>that all the</HI> Paenal Laws <HI>were</HI> Local, <HI>and</HI> limited, <HI>and did not extend to the Plantations, and the</HI> Act of Toleration <HI>being made to take off the edge of the</HI> Paenal Laws; <HI>therefore the</HI> Act of Toleration <HI>does not extend to any Plantations?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire the Law may be produced; for I am <HI>morally</HI> perswad∣ed, there is no <HI>limitation</HI> or <HI>restriction</HI> in the Law to <HI>England, Wales,</HI> and <HI>Berwick on Tweed;</HI> for it extends to sundry Plantations of the Queens Dominions, as <HI>Barbadoes, Virginia,</HI> and <HI>Maryland;</HI> which was evident from the Certificates produced, which we could not have obtained, if the Act of Parliament had not extended to the Plantations.</P>
<P>And Mr. <HI>Makemie</HI> further said, that he presumed <HI>New-York</HI> was a part of Her Majesties Dominions also; and that sundry Ministers on the
<PB N="4" REF="001300_0008_0FB27B3BCF0A72D8"/>
East-end of <HI>Long-Island,</HI> had complied with said Law, and <HI>qualifyed</HI> them∣selves at Court, by complying with the directions of said Law, and have no <HI>Licence</HI> from you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lordship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld. C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Yes,</HI> New-York <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Her Majesties Dominions; but the</HI> Act of Toleration <HI>does not extend to the Plantations by its own</HI> intrinsick vertue, <HI>or any</HI> intention <HI>of the</HI> Legislators, <HI>but only by Her Majesties</HI> Royal Instructi∣ons <HI>signifyed unto me, and that is from Her</HI> Prerogative <HI>and</HI> Clemency. <HI>And the Courts which have qualifyed these men, are in an error, and I shall check them for it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Law extends to the Plantations any manner of way, whether by the Queens <HI>Prerogative, Clemency,</HI> or otherwise, our Certifi∣cates were a demonstration we had complied therewith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld. C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>These Certificates only were for</HI> Virginia <HI>and</HI> Maryland; <HI>they did not extend to</HI> New-York.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>We presume my Lord, our Certificates do extend as far as the Law extends; for we are directed by the <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> to qualifie our selves in the places where we live, which we have done; and the same Law directs us to take <HI>Certificates</HI> of our <HI>qualification,</HI> which we have accordingly done; and these Certificates are not to Certify to such as behold us taking our Qualification, being performed in the face of the Country, at a publick Court; but our Certificates must be to satisfie others abroad in the World, who saw it not, nor heard any thing of it, otherwise it were needless. And that Law which obliges us to take a Certificate, must allow said Certificate to have a credit and reputation in Her <HI>Majesties Dominions,</HI> otherwise it is to no purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ld. C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>That Act of Parliament was made against</HI> Strowling Preachers, <HI>and you are</HI> such, <HI>and</HI> shall not Preach in my Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is not one word, my Lord, mentioned in any part of the Law, against <HI>Travelling</HI> or <HI>Strowling Preachers,</HI> as Your Excellency is pleased to call them, and we are to judge that to be the true end of the Law, which is specifyed in the <HI>Preamble</HI> thereof, which is for the <HI>satisfaction</HI> of <HI>Scrupulous Consciences,</HI> and <HI>Uniting</HI> the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> in interest and affection. And it is well known my Lord, to all, that Quakers, who also have Liberty by this Law, have few or no <HI>fixed Tea∣chers,</HI> but chiefly taught by such as <HI>Travel;</HI> and it is known to all such are sent forth by the <HI>Yearly Meeting</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> and Travel and Teach o∣ver the Plantations, and are not molested.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Ld. C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>I have troubled some of them, and will trouble them more.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>We hear my Lord, one of them was Prosecuted at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> but it was not for <HI>Travelling</HI> or <HI>Teaching,</HI> but for <HI>particulars</HI> in Teaching, for which he suffered.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to our <HI>Doctrines,</HI> my Lord, we have our <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI> which is known to the Christian World, and I challenge all the Clergy of <HI>York</HI> to show us any false or pernicious Doctrines therein; Yea, with those exceptions specifyed in the Law, we are able to make it appear, they are in all <HI>Doctrinal Articles</HI> of Faith agreeable to the Established Do∣ctrines of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Ld. C.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>There is one thing wanting in your Certificates, and that is Signing the Articles of the Church of</HI> England.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is the Clerks omission, my Lord, for which we are no way accountable, by not being full and more particular; but if we had not complyed with the whole Law, in all the parts thereof, we should not have had Certificates pursuant to said Act of Parliament. And Your Lordship may be assured, we have done nothing in complying with said Law, but what we are still ready to perform, if your Lordship require it, and that ten times over: And as to the <HI>Articles</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> I hare a Copy in my Pocket, and am ready at all times to Sign, with <HI>those ex∣ceptions</HI> specifyed in the Law.</P>

<P><HI>You Preached in a</HI> Private House, <HI>not certifyed according to Act of Parliament.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>There were endeavours used for my Preaching in a more pub∣lick place, and (tho' without my knowledge) your Lordships permissi∣on was demanded for my Preaching in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Church; and being denied, we were under a necessity, of assembling for Publick Worship in a Private House, which we did, in as <HI>publick</HI> a <HI>manner</HI> as possible, with <HI>open doors:</HI> And we are directed to certify the same to the next Quarter Sessions, which cannot be done, until the Quarter Sessions come in course; for the Law binds no man to impossibilities; and if we do not certifie to the next Quarter Sessions, we shall be cul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble, but not till then: For it is evident, my Lord, that this Act of Parlia∣ment was made, and passed the Royal Assent, <HI>May</HI> 24<HI>th.</HI> And it being some time before the Quarter Sessions came in course, and all Ministers in <HI>England</HI> continued to Preach, without one days cess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion or forbear∣ance; and we hope the practice of <HI>England,</HI> should be a president for <HI>America.</HI></P>

<P>We are neither ashamed, nor affraid of what we have done; and we have complied, and are ready still to comply with the Act of Parliament, which we hope will protect us at last: And it will be unac∣countable to <HI>England,</HI> to hear, that <HI>Jews,</HI> who openly blaspheme the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and disown the whole Christian Reli∣gion; <HI>Quakers</HI> who disown the Fundamental Doctrines of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and both Sacraments; <HI>Lutherans,</HI> and all others, are tolera∣ted in Your Lordships Government: and only we, who have complied, and are still ready to comply with the Act of Toleration, and are nea∣rest to, and likest the Church of <HI>England</HI> of any Dissenters, should be hindered, and that only in the Government of <HI>New-York,</HI> and the <HI>Jer∣sies.</HI> This will appear strange indeed.</P>

<SPEAKER>F. M</SPEAKER>
<P>We do not, neither have we any reason to blame Her Majesty, for She molests none, neither countenances or encourages any who do; and has given frequent assurances, and of late in Her Gracious Speech to Her Parliament, <HI>That She would inviolably maintain the Toleration.</HI></P>
<P>While Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> was writing Precepts for discharging us from the custody of <HI>Card<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> High Sheriff of <HI>Queens County</HI> in <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and another for our Commitment in <HI>York;</HI> Mr. <HI>John Hampton</HI> demand∣ed a Licence of Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> but he absolutely denied it.</P>
<P>And before finishing of said Mittimus, for their Commitment, Mr. <HI>Francis Makemie</HI> moved, that it was highly necessary before their Com∣mitment, the Law should be produced, to determine that point, whether it is local and limited, or not: And it is not to be doubted, but Mr. At∣torney was soon able to produce the Law: And he further offered to pay Mr. Attorney for a Copy of that Paragraph, in which the limiting Clause is, if any. But every thing relating hereunto was declined and disregarded.</P>

<P>There are sundry things observable in this Warrant of Commitment; which is not usual in Warrants granted in <HI>England.</HI> 1. That it is Grant∣ed and Signed by the Supream Authority, and not by any Sworn Of∣ficers, appointed and authorized by Law, for Commitment of Offen∣ders: And the Supream Authority of <HI>England,</HI> have not put any such power into practice, without a Special Act of Parliament, impowring them so to do; and that only upon necessity and emergent occasions. 2. Here is no mention of the Queens Name, or Authority, which must be acknowledged a novelty not easily understood. 3. There is not the least shadow of a crime or suspicion of a crime alleadged, which is but a slender cause of Commitment. 4. This Mittimus is erroneous in Conclusion, which should be, until they are delivered by due course of Law, and not until further Order, which is condemned by Law and Lawyers as insufficient.</P>
<P>And finding themselves Imprisoned, and put under an unlimited Confinement, they addressed Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> by the following Hum∣ble Petition, presented to his Lordship, by the Hands of <HI>Ebenezer Wilson,</HI> High Sheriff.</P>

<P>To which Petition, after sundry days, they received the following verbal answer, by the Sheriff who presented the former Petition. 1.

It is observable, the second Warrant is still granted, and signed by the Supream Authority, and without mentioning the Queens Name o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Authority: And the supposed Crime specifyed is double; as 1. Prea∣ching in <HI>New-York</HI> Government, without complying with the qualifi∣cations of an Act of Parliament, made the first year of King <HI>William</HI> &amp; Queen <HI>Mary:</HI> Whereas Ld. <HI>Cornbury</HI> had read in <HI>January,</HI> their Certifi∣cates both from <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> certifying their qualification ac∣cording to said Act of Parliament. 2. Preaching without Licence be∣ing first obtained of Lord <HI>Cornbury;</HI> whereby it is plain, that comply∣ing with the Law, is not sufficient without a Licence: And from what goes before, it is undeniable, they were qualifyed, and had complyed with the Law, even in <HI>New-York</HI> Government, before the date of this last Warrant, and that was by tendering themselves, not only to his Ex∣cellency, but also to the Quarter Sessions, for qualification; which is all that any Dissenter can do, and all the Law requires of them to be done: And such as had Licence, are not yet qualifyed according to said Act of Parliament. For taking the Oaths only before Ld. <HI>Cornbu∣ry,</HI> and taking them before a Court, are not the same.

<P>Here is a Presentment for Preaching a Sermon at <HI>York,</HI> highly aggra∣vated into a Cumulative Crime, and thereby the Grand-Jury, led into no small mistake, in point of time; for it is said to be Preached on the two and twentieth day of <HI>January;</HI> whereas it was Preached on the twentieth of <HI>January:</HI> for these two Ministers were Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI>'s Prisoners, apprehended on <HI>Long-Island,</HI> on the two and twen∣tieth day instant, by a Warrant, dated the one and twentieth day:

Which error was cause enough in point of Law, for overthrowing the whole Presentment, which was so delayed and put off to the last day of the Court, that a Tryal could not be obtained that Court: There∣fore Mr. <HI>Reignere,</HI> the Defendants Council made a motion, that the De∣fendants appearance be but upon Record, and it was ordered the De∣fendant be continued on his Recognizance, until the next Term: Mr. <HI>Makemie</HI> being the only person prosecuted, returns for <HI>Virginia,</HI> and re∣turns again before <HI>June</HI> Term, the third of said Month.</P>

<P>The Attorney General for the Queen moves to know, if they would allow a Copy of the Queens Instructions to the Governour, Signed by his Excellency, to be brought into Court, in Evidence at the Tryal, see∣ing his Excellency, who had the Originals, was then in the <HI>Jerseys.</HI></P>
<P>The Defendant replied, they could admit of no Copies, seeing there was time enough to have produced the Original; or Mr. Attorney might have compared the Copy with the Original, and might have been able to give his Affidavit to the truth of said Copy; but perceiving if that Copy was not allowed of, the Queens Attorney would put off the Tryal till another time.</P>
<P>Therefore Mr. Attorney General for the Queen, &amp; Mr. <HI>William Nicoll</HI> for the Defendant, agrees, that the Copy of such Instructions from Her Majesty to the Governour, as shall be produced by the Attorney General, and Signed by the Governour, shall be admitted on Tryal, to be the same in Evidence, as if the Original Instructions were produced. <HI>F.

The Defendant further adds, he was amazed to find one who was so lately dragooned out of <HI>France,</HI> for his Religion, and delivered out of the Galleys, so soon prove a Persecuter of the same Religion, for Preaching a Sermon in this City.</P>

<P>Mr. Attorney produced a Copy of the Queens Instructions, Signed by Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> and allowed of by both parties in Evidence, as if the Original were present, and tho' a Copy was denied again and again to the Defendant, yet by a Copy of Instructions from King <HI>William</HI> to a former Governour, the same Instructions were found, in the same words; and as they were in two Paragraphs in the produced Copy, so they were found at a great distance from one another in the former Copy, supposed to be agreeable to the Original, and to be two distinct and vastly different Instructions; one of them relating to the Dissen∣ters, the other relating to the Ministers of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as may plainly appear from the Instructions themselves in the following words.</P>
<Q><P>And you are to permit a Liberty of Conscience to all Persons <HI>(except Pa∣pists)</HI>

so they be cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted with a quiet and peaceable enjoyment of it, not giving offence or scandal to the Government.</P>
<P>You are not to permit any Minister coming from <HI>England,</HI> to Preach in your Government, without a Certificate, from the Right Reverend, the Bi∣shop of <HI>London:</HI> Nor any other Minister, coming from any other part or place, without first obtaining leave from you, our Governour.</P></Q>
<P>Mr. Attorney Orders four of Mr. <HI>Makemies</HI> Hearers to be called, Cap. <HI>John Theobolds,</HI> Mr. <HI>John Vanborn,</HI> Mr. <HI>William Jackson,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Anthony Young,</HI> who answered to their Names.</P>
<P>The Defednant perceiving they were summoned and called, to give their Evidence to the matter of Fact; told the Court, that the Swearing of these four Gentlemen as Evidences, would but give a needless trouble, and take up the Courts time; and he would own the matter of fact as to his Preaching, and more than these Gentlemen could declare upon Oath; for he had done nothing therein, that he was ashamed or afraid of, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t would answer and own it, not only before this Bar, but before the <HI>Tribunal of Gods Final Judgment.</HI> And so Mr. Attorney proposed, and Mr. <HI>Makemie</HI> answered the following Questions, or to the same purpose.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Attorney.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>You own, that you Preached a Sermon, and Baptized a Child at Mr.</HI> William Jacksons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I did.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Attor.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>How many Hearers had you?</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have other work to do, Mr. Attorney, then to number my Auditory, when I am about to Preach to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Attor.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Was there above five hearing you?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and five to that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Attor.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Did you use the Rites and Ceremonies enjoined by, and prescri∣bed in the Book of Common Prayer, by the Church of</HI> England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I never did, nor ever will, until I am better satisfied in my Conscience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Attor.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Did you ask leave, or acquaint my Lord</HI> Cornbury <HI>with your Preaching at</HI> York, <HI>when you dined with him at the Fort?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not know of my Preaching at <HI>York,</HI> when I dined with his Excellency, no, not for some days after: For when we came to <HI>York</HI> we had not the least intention, or design of Preaching there; but stopt at <HI>York,</HI> purely to pay our respects to the Governour, which we did; but being afterwards called, and invited to Preach, as I was a
<PB N="21" REF="001300_0025_0FB27B6219D7D070"/>
Minister of the Gospel, I durst not deny Preaching, nor I hope ever shall, where it is wanting and desired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Attor.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Did you acquaint my Lord</HI> Cornbury <HI>with the place of your Preaching?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>As soon as I determined to Preach, leave was asked, tho' not by me; for it was the peoples business, and not mine, to provide a place for me to Preach in: And I would have been admitted to Preach in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Church, but they were affraid of offending Lord <HI>Cornbury;</HI> And Mr. <HI>Anthony Young</HI> went to the Governour, to have his leave, or permission for my Preaching in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Church; tho' all this was done, without so much as my knowledge: But my Lord opposing and denying it, I was under a necessity of Preaching where I did, in a pri∣vate House, tho' in a publick manner with open doors. Mr. Attorney in pleading, first read over the Indictment which the Grand Jury found, and endeavoured to prove the several parts thereof, by giving a large and full account of sundry Statutes of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, asserting and establishing the Supremacy of the King over all Ecclesiastical Persons and Affairs, in his Dominion of <HI>England.</HI> And from thence asserted the Queens Supremacy in Ecclesiastical Affairs, and over Ecclesi∣astick persons; which Supremacy was by a Delegation lodged in his Excellency our Governour, which he is sworn to exercise; and this is signified to him by Her Majesties Instructions, which were read in Court. Then he proceeded to produce, and read as much as was ne∣cessary, of those Statutes of Qeean <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and King <HI>Charles</HI> the Se∣cond, <HI>For Uniformity of Worship according to the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of</HI> England; <HI>and the Paenal Laws against Conventicles:</HI> And enlar∣ging his pleadings on these points; he turns to the Gentlemen of the Jury, and says, the matter of fact is plainly confessed by the Defen∣dant, and I have proved it to be repugnant to the Queens Instructions, and sundry Acts of Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> Therefore did not doubt, but the Jury would find for the Queen, and against the Defendant.</P>
</SP>
<P>Mr. <HI>Ja. Reignere,</HI> Attorney for the Defendant, pleads against Mr. At∣torney for the Queen, as followeth: The Indictment charges three di∣stinct and separate facts as Crimes against the Defendant.</P>
<P N="1">1. That he, a pretended Protestant Minister, endeavouring to subvert the Queens Supremacy, Jurisdiction and Authority in Ecclesiastical Affairs; did privately and unlawfully Preach and Teach, at <HI>William Jacksons</HI> House, diverse Subjects, privately and unlawfully, to above five in number, without Licence had according to Law, in derogation to the Royal Authority and Prerogative, to the evil example, &amp; <HI>cont. Par.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="22" REF="001300_0026_0FB27B6645E59CF0"/>2. That he did assemble diverse unknown, and unvoluntarily, and un∣lawfully use any other Rites and Forms of Worship, then are in the Common-Prayer and Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England: Cont. Form. Stat.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That being not qualifyed by Law to Preach and Teach in a Con∣gregation or Meeting not allowed by Law, in other manner then ac∣cording to the practice of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> at which Meeting were five persons, or more assembled, <HI>Cont. Form. Stat.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Indictment, <HI>ut supra,</HI> that the Defendant did not Preach privately, nor the persons assemble privately, <HI>i. e.</HI> with doors lockt, barr'd or bolted; nay, it appears by the Evidence, and agreed to the contrary by Mr. Attorney General: that the people met unlawfully, must appear by the violation of some known Law or Statute, in force here, by which such Meeting and Preaching is forbidden; that is to say, the Preaching above five.</P>
<P>I take this Colony, as a Dominion of <HI>England,</HI> to be governed by, and subject to these three sorts of Laws: 1. The Common Law of <HI>En∣gland.</HI> 2. The express Statutes mentioning the Plantations, and such o∣ther as are for publick good (as the Chief Justice was pleased to say in this Court, in the Case depending between <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Davis</HI>). 3. By the Laws of this Colony, and those are to be as near as may be agreeable to the Laws and Statutes of <HI>England;</HI> and the Judges of this Court (I dare say) will examine and determine no fact, but accord∣ing to the mode and rule of some of those Laws.</P>
<P>That Preaching without Licence, and assembling above five is a Crime at Common Law, I never read, and it is not alleadged to be against any Statute; it must be an offence against some Law of this Province, which as yet I never saw, and desire I may now see it; and if such does not appear, then undoubtedly <HI>where there is no Law, there can be no transgression.</HI></P>
<P>As to what is offered by Mr. Attorney, that the Queen, as Supream Head of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> hath power to make Ordinances, and punish for breach thereof; that this power is delegated to the Gover∣nour, who is bound by Oath to Execute them.</P>
<P>Supposing and admitting all this; yet nothing like an Ordinance ap∣pears: for the Instructions produced by Mr. Attorney cannot have the force of a Law or Ordinance, especially against persons to whom they were never communicated; what they may be to those to whom they were given, who alone hath the Custody of them, and conceals them from publick view.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="001300_0027_0FB27B67881D1E30"/>As to the two Articles in the Indictment; <HI>Cont. Form. Stat.</HI></P>
<P>Now there are diverse Statutes made in <HI>England,</HI> which enjoin a due observance of the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as the 1st of <HI>Eliz.

<P>And tho' Mr. Att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey endeavouring to invalidate this, by denying this Law to be in force, yet could not prove this Law abolished.</P>
<P>And by one of the Instructions, which Mr. Attorney produced, <HI>in te∣tidem verbis,</HI> is the same, that has been given to former Governours of this Province, Liberty of Conscience is directed to be allowed.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="001300_0028_0FB27B6E1B5BEBE8"/>As to the Third Article in the Indictment, that seems to refer to the first of <HI>William</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> of Toleration; but as we say, the Paenal Sta∣tutes did not extend hither, so is there no occasion of Toleration. The Laws and Statutes of <HI>England</HI> by their own force, extend equally to all Plantations of <HI>England</HI> alike; and if these Paenal Laws did extend to the Plantations, the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> would never Tolerate the Go∣vernments of <HI>Boston, Rhode-Island, Connecticut,</HI> and others; who in their Church-Discipline are so far from Conforming to the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> that they have Set up and Established another sort of Church-Dis∣cipline universally among them; but notwithstanding this, they are allowed the liberty they always used in their Church without molestation, and were so allowed in the very time when these Paenal Laws were in force in <HI>England;</HI> but now since by the late Act of To∣leration, it was thought by the wise and experienced Legislators of <HI>En∣gland,</HI> to be for the <HI>Publick Good,</HI> to repeal these Laws, even there, for which place only they were made, and to allow Liberty of Conscience; I hope it will never be thought, that those Paenal Statutes, so repealed, are, or can be for the <HI>Publick Good</HI> here, and as such extended hither. Wherefore, forasmuch, as neither by the Common Law of <HI>England,</HI> nor by any Law of this Province produced, or even alleadged by Mr. At∣torney, such Preaching or Meeting, doth appear unlawful (but on the contrary, an express Law of this Province doth allow it, as hath been shewen) and that the Paenal Laws and Statutes of <HI>England</HI> against Dis∣senters, can by no reasonable construction, be extended hither, I hum∣bly conceive my Client is not guilty of any offence against Law, and hope the Jury will acquit him accordingly.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>William Nicol,</HI> Attorney for the Defendant, pleads in the next place, as followeth.</P>
<P>Mr. Attorney has been entertaining us with some History from the Reign of K. <HI>Henry</HI> 8. And it is fit we should entertain him with some History also, more ancient, and from better Authors, and that is from the Acts of the Apostles; for we do find, that Teaching, or Preaching, or Speaking in it self, or by the Common Law, was never found a Crime; for the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> Preached a very new Doctrine to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> which was an ancient Commonwealth, and was not Condem∣ned or Imprisoned for it, but they were curious to hear again, <HI>Act.</HI> 17. concerning the new Doctrine of the Resurrection; but we find, when the same Apostle began to insist on any Doctrine which tended to in∣fringe the gain of the Silver Smiths, who <HI>Act.</HI> 18. made Shrines for
<PB N="25" REF="001300_0029_0FB27B7243090DC8"/>
<HI>Diana,</HI> the Goddess of the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> they were enraged, and made an uproar against him, rushing into the Theatre; but it was no Crime, ei∣ther in <HI>Corinth</HI> or <HI>Athens,</HI> where no man was hurt by the Doctrine it self, neither was obstructed by, nor any offence to the Civil Govern∣ment.</P>
<P>And it is plain, it was no offence at Common Law, but was made so by the old Statutes of 5 <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 5. 2 <HI>Hen.</HI> 4 <HI>Cap.</HI> 15.2 <HI>Hen.</HI> 5. But all these Statutes being repealed by 1 <HI>El.</HI> 6. and by Act; of <HI>Eliz.</HI> it was still no transgression, but remains as it was, no crime at Common Law.</P>
<P>And the four Statutes against Conventicles in <HI>Cb.</HI> 2. are all local, and in express words, limited to <HI>England, Wales,</HI> and <HI>Berwick</HI> on <HI>Tweed,</HI> so have no relation, to, nor reach to any of the Plantations.</P>
<P>And this is further manifest, from the Constitution of the Plantati∣ons, being as it were settled by National Consent, for those whose thoughts in Religious Affairs could not square with the Publick Esta∣blishment in Church Government, Discipline and Ceremonies, as <HI>New-England</HI> for Independants and Presbyterians, <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> and <HI>New-Jer∣seys,</HI> and we may add <HI>New-York,</HI> for the several sorts of Dissenters in general; <HI>Pensilvania</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> for Quakers &amp; Papists in particular.</P>
<P>And this being the first that was prosecuted in this nature in the Plantations, is made the more remarkable, so long after the news of those harsh Statutes of <HI>Cb.</HI> 2. have been cut by the Statute of 1. <HI>William</HI> &amp; <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>And it is already evidently proved, that the Acts of Assembly of <HI>New-York;</HI> allow Liberty of Conscience, with freedom of Publick Wor∣ship, to all but Papists.</P>
<P>What was offered on the other side, by Mr. Attorney, as being against the Queens Prerogative in Ecclesiastical Affairs, was foreign, and not at all to the purpose; for all the Statutes relating to that matter, being to assert the Queens Empire, and Jurisdiction over Ecclesiastical Persons, as well as Lay-men, in opposition to the Claim and Usurpation of the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> to exempt the Clergy, or Church-men, from the Civil and Secular Power.</P>
<P>And as to the Queens Instructions, they are not, neither can have the force of a Law; besides that, these two Instructions produced in Court, are no way against us, but rather for us.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>David Jamison,</HI> Attorney for the Defendant, appears next to plead in the following manner.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Reignere,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Nicol,</HI> Attorneys on the same side, having offer∣ed so many and large Arguments, have left but little room for new mat∣ter to be offered, without enumerating what was offered upon the three heads of the Indictment.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="001300_0030_0FB27B7A05C6A728"/>As to the first, which was Preaching and Teaching without Licence, against the Queens Supremacy and Prerogative in Ecclesiastical Affairs. We did not come here to oppose, or call in question the Queens Pre∣rogative or Supremacy: but were willing to pay all due respect &amp; de∣ference thereunto; but we cannot see, that these Instructions from the Queen to my Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> of which Mr. Attorney has produced a Copy, and which he alleadges to be the Law we have broken by Prea∣ching, contrary to the Queens Instructions, which are not a Law to a∣ny body else, but to his Lordship, who is directed by them, and is ac∣countable to the Queen, if he do not observe them. Her Instructions are private directions to himself, and can be no Law to others: Pro∣mulgation is that which gives the finishing stroke to a Law. Nor do I see how his Lordship should become guilty of breach of Oath, as Mr. Attorney was pleased to offer, by not ordering the prosecution of this Gentleman, for Preaching without his Licence; altho' he be Sworn to obey and observe his Instructions, because the very Instructions produ∣ced, give Liberty of Conscience to Protestant Dissenters, and are in two distinct Paragraphs; the first seems to me wholly to agree with our Act of Assembly of this Province, is to the same purpose, and very near the same words; the other Paragraph is negative: <HI>You are not to permit any Minister coming from</HI> England, <HI>to Preach in your Government, without a Certificate from the Right Reverend, the Bishop of</HI> London; <HI>nor any other Mi∣nister coming from any other Part, or Place, without first obtaining leave from you our Governour.</HI> And a Dissenting Minister Preaching here without the Governours knowledge, could be no breach of his Oath, because it was done without his knowledge, and consequently without his per∣mission.</P>
<P>To the Second, as to the Statutes of <HI>Eliz.</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> 2. against Con∣venticles, they were limited and local Acts or Statutes, and could not any way reach these Plantations; for here in <HI>New-York</HI> we have no E∣stablished Religion for the whole Province. On the East-end of <HI>Nas∣saw,</HI> or <HI>Long-Island,</HI> were, and always have been Independant Ministers, the <HI>French</HI> had their own way and Ministers, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> in like man∣ner; the very <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Quakers</HI> have the free Exercise of their Reli∣gion; and there is not one Form of Worship Established for the whole Province. The 16th. as well as 22 of K. <HI>Charles</HI> 2. are limited to the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> and Town of <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Twe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> and therefore the using of any other Form of Worship in this Province, then what is contained in the Common-Prayer, cannot be a Breach of those Statutes. Then again the 16 of <HI>Ch.</HI> 2. for suppressing
<PB N="27" REF="001300_0031_0FB27B7B98F538A0"/>
Conventicles, makes the third default Banishment, for seven years into the Plantations (<HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> excepted;) And how can it be supposed, that the Plantations the places to which the defaulters were to be Banished, can be understood to be comprehended within the mea∣ning and penalty of that Statute; that did continue in force, for little more time than four years. The other of the 22<HI>d.</HI> did supply its room, and had much more mild penalties.</P>
<P>As to the third, which is that he Preached without being qualifyed, that is laid against the Act of Toleration. I did offer, that this Sta∣tute likewise was not, nor is in force in the Plantations generally, es∣pecially in this Province, altho' there be no locality expressly mention∣ed therein, and that for these Reasons. The title and whole design of it is Toleration; now Toleration is an exception from some restraint; and since the Paenal Laws are not of force here by consequence, nei∣ther is the Act of Toleration of force, here is no Established Church for the whole Province; from which we should be tolerated. We have had liberty of Conscience another way, and by an Act of Assem∣bly, which was made in the beginning of the Reign of K. <HI>William</HI> and Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> during the Government of Col. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> not yet formally re∣pealed. Then again consider the Preamble of the Act of Toleration, to the end that all our Protestant Subjects, may be united in interest and affection; the wisdom of the Nation did at that time combine, to put an end to all Persecution on the score of Religion. Our Assembly was much of the same mind, designing to prevent it, and so are all good men: when we did set about erecting a Church of <HI>England</HI> Congrega∣tion in this Town, and obtained a Charter for the same, of Governour <HI>Fletcher;</HI> altho' we were desirous to have the National Worship amongst us, yet was it the care of these Members, who promoted it, to get such Clauses inserted in it, as should secure the Liberty of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Congregations from our Successors; and in an Act of Assembly made since, for its encouragement, the like care and precaution was had; which are still to be seen.</P>
<P>This Province has not been much more than forty years in the pos∣session of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and is made up chiefly of Foreigners, and Dissenters; and Persecution would not only tend to the disuniting us all, in interest and affection, but depopulate and weaken our Strength, and discourage all such Adventurers for the future. Therefore as this Prosecution is the first of this nature or sort, ever was in this Province, so I hope it will be the last.</P>
<P>The Defendant prayed, he might have liberty to speak for himself,
<PB N="28" REF="001300_0032_0FB27B7E8B0BBE58"/>
which was granted; and he pleaded in his own defence, the following Arguments, which I publish in his own words.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am amazed to find Mr. Attorney so much changed in his o∣pinion; for when I was before my Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> who told us, the Act of Toleration was limited and local, and extended not to the Plantati∣ons: And Mr. Attorney being pleased to confirm it, by asserting the same thing, and went a little further, by producing an Argument to strengthen his opinion, That the Paenal Laws of <HI>England,</HI> did not ex∣tend to the Plantations, and the Act of Toleration was made to take off the edge of the Paenal Laws; Therefore the Toleration does not extend hither; but we find soon after by an Indictment, both the Pae∣nal Laws and Toleration reaches hither, and all their penalties too.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Honourable Chief Justice, <HI>Roger Mompesson</HI> Esqr. interrupted the Defendant, by saying: Gentlemen, <HI>Do not trouble the Court with what dis∣course passed between you, before my Lord, or at any other time, but speak to the point.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F. M.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it please your Honour, I hope to make it appear, it is to the point; and what was Mr. Attorneys argument then, is now mine: For whatever opinion I was of, while an absolute Stranger to <HI>New-York,</HI> and its Constitution; yet since I have informed my self tho∣rowly with the Constitution of this place, I am intirely of Mr. Attor∣neys opinion, and hope he will be of the same still.</P>
<P>And as to the Indictment, to return to the particulars thereof; and first, I am charged with contemning, and endeavouring to Subvert the Supremacy of the Queen in Ecclesiastical Affairs. As to the Queens Supremacy about Ecclesiastical persons and things, we allow and be-believe, She has as large a Supremacy, as in the Word of God is al∣lowed to any Christian Kings and Princes in the World; and our Con∣fession of Faith, which will compare with any in the World, and is u∣niversally known to the Christian World, is very full in that matter; a part whereof is judged necessary to be inserted here, for the infor∣mation of many.</P>

</TEXT></Q>
<P>And in all which Mr. Attorney has offered concerning the Queens Supremacy in Ecclesiastical Affairs, I cannot learn one argument, or one word, from all the quoted Statutes, that Preaching a Sermon, is the least contempt, or overthrow of the Supremacy. And I hope it is not now unknown to any, that the Oath of Supremacy, has been abolish∣ed by a Law, ever since the Revolution, and consequently the Subject must be delivered from some obligation thereby: and how far this will be constructed to extend, I leave to the Judges to determine.</P>
<P>And as to my Preaching without Licence first obtained from Lord <HI>Cornbury,</HI> which is asserted to be against Law; I cannot hear from any Law yet produced, that Ld. <HI>Cornbury</HI> has any power or directions to grant a Licence to any Dissenters, or that any of them are under any obligation, to take Licence from his Lordship, before they Preach, or after Mr Attorney pretends no Law, unless he concludes the Queens Instructions to be a Law, or have the force of a Law: That they have no force of a Law, has been abundantly proved already; neither am I any way culpable even from the Queens Instructions, which are produ∣ced in Court; for they consisting of two parts, or rather two distinct Instructions, not relating at all to the same persons: <HI>In the first,</HI> his Excellency is required to permit a Liberty of Conscience to all per∣sons except Papists. And this is the Liberty is allowed to Dissenters and which we claim, by virtue of this Instruction: and here is no Li∣cence
<PB N="30" REF="001300_0034_0FB27B8392619100"/>
mentioned and required; for permission is a negative act, and implies no more but this; you shall so allow it, as not to hinder, mo∣lest or disquiet them, but rather protect them in it: And Papists being particularly expressed, it cannot be applied to the Church of <HI>England;</HI> therefore Dissenters are intended by this Instruction, and no other; and if this permission is granted us, according to the express words thereof, we desire no more. And it cannot be esteemed by any, that imprisoning and punishing of us at such a rate, for Preaching one Ser∣mon, is a permitting us Liberty of Conscience. <HI>The other</HI> distinct <HI>Pa∣ragraph,</HI> or rather, the other Instruction, which tho' joined together in this Copy, are at a considerable distance from one another in the Ori∣ginal; as we really found it so, in a Copy of Instructions to a former Governour: And as the former concerns Dissenters, so this is intended for the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> for the words of the Instru∣ction, as you have it above, are these: <HI>You are not to permit any Minister coming from</HI> England, <HI>to Preach in your Government, without a Certificate from the Right Reverend, the Bishop of</HI> London, <HI>nor any other Minister coming from any other part or place, without first obtaining leave of you, our Governour.</HI> Here is another Instruction, which should not be produced or improved against Dissenters; for all mankind, and those of the meanest capacity must conclude and determine, that this concerns only the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who by their Constitution, are under strict obliga∣tions to take Licence, or Certificate from their Ordinary, and such as come to the Plantations, acknowledge the Bishop of <HI>London</HI> as such; and no Dissenter, either in <HI>England,</HI> or any where else in the Queens Dominion, ever took, or ever was under any obligation to take any Licence from the Queens or Kings of <HI>England,</HI> or any other Person or Persons whatsoever; until a method &amp; practice has of late been erect∣ed, and forced into practice at <HI>New-York:</HI> For if our Liberty either de∣pended on a Licence or Certificate from the Bishops of <HI>England,</HI> or the Governours of <HI>America,</HI> we should soon be deprived of our Liberty of Conscience, secured to us by Law, and repeated Resolutions of our pre∣sent Soveraign, and Gracious Queen, inviolably to maintain the Tole∣ration which She is pleased to signifie in Her Royal Instructions to all Her Governours abroad; which we are the more assured of, from the Instructions produced in this Court. So that as the first clause of this latter Instruction, cannot be applied to any other Ministers, but of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> so the latter clause can be understood of no other but the same sort, or species, as those who came from <HI>England</HI> with Certificate from the Bishop of <HI>London:</HI> And it is well known, there are
<PB N="31" REF="001300_0035_0FB27B8499153BF0"/>
Ministers of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who may come, and do come not directly from <HI>England,</HI> but from some other place, as from sundry Plan∣tations of <HI>America;</HI> as Mr. <HI>Sharp</HI> now Chaplain at <HI>Fort-Anne,</HI> came not directly from <HI>England,</HI> but from <HI>Maryland:</HI> And I must confess, he being a Minister of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and enjoyes a considerable Bene∣fice thereby, was obliged to comply with the Constitution of his own Church, and take a Licence from Ld. <HI>Cornbury,</HI> if none could be produ∣ced from the Bishop of <HI>London.</HI> But all this is foreign to us, and not at all required of any Dissenter in <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>And if there had been any thing in these Instructions requiring Dis∣senters to take any Licence, or empowering Governours of the Planta∣tions to grant them, which we do not find; Preaching a Sermon be∣fore such Licence, cannot be judged a Crime, deserving such a Con∣finement and Prosecution as we have met with; for it has been already made appear, that those Instruction cannot have the force of a Law, to bind the Subject to Obedience, or render him culpable for Disobedience, seeing Promulgation, which is the Life of the Law, and renders all per∣sons inexcusable, never as yet have accompanied these Instructions: So if this be Mr. Attorneys Law we have broke, by not obtaining Licence before Preaching, I hope, you Gentlemen of the Jury cannot but find, we are no way culpable hereby, being neither inconsistent with the Queens Instructions, and not against any Law.</P>
<P>And as to the last part of the Indictment, concerning the Paenal Laws, or the sundry Statutes against Conventicles, they never were designed, nor intended by our <HI>English</HI> Legislators for <HI>America,</HI> or any of the Plan∣tations thereof; for they are limited &amp; local Acts, all of them restrict∣ed to <HI>England, Wales,</HI> and <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> as is manifest from the express words of said Law; neither have been ever put in execution in any of the Plantations, until now; yea, have not been executed, even in <HI>England, Wales</HI> or <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed,</HI> for which they were Calcula∣ted, and made, these twenty years past: And when they were put in the most strict and rigorous Execution in <HI>England,</HI> which was about the last of the Reign of K. <HI>Ch.</HI> 2. The Dissenters of <HI>America</HI> lived very quiet, and even in such Plantations where the Church of <HI>England</HI> has a full and formal Establishment. But which is more, even <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> who are excluded from all benefit of the Act of Toleration in <HI>England;</HI> yet cannot be touched in <HI>America,</HI> by these Paenal Laws; for it is matter of fact known to all, and I appeal to Mr. <HI>Reignere</HI> if Papists have not li∣berty, and the exercise of their Religion, without molestation from Pae∣nal Laws, and even in <HI>Maryland,</HI> where the Church of <HI>England</HI> has a
<PB N="32" REF="001300_0036_0FB27B86CBEBF0E0"/>
formal establishment by Laws made there: And it is manifestly known, the Assembly of <HI>Maryland</HI> made a late Act against <HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> and tho' it was never executed, not being approved of by the Queen, yet it is a plain demonstration, if the Paenal Laws of <HI>England</HI> originally and principally designed against <HI>Popish Recusants</HI> had extended to the Planta∣tions, there would have been no need for such an Act of Assembly to be made against them in <HI>Maryland.</HI></P>
<P>It is a further argument the Paenal Laws never did extend to the Plan∣tations, because it was a penalty in some of them, that persons after sun∣dry and so many convictions, are to be banished or transported to the <HI>American</HI> Plantations, as places removed beyond, and free from the lash of Paenal Laws; for to what purpose would their banishment be, if af∣ter a removal from their Native Land, they should be lashed, or ruin∣ed afresh by the same Paenal Laws.</P>
<P>And if the Penal Laws of <HI>England</HI> do not extend to these Plantations, where the Church of <HI>England</HI> has a legal and formal Establishment, it cannot be imagined, they can take place where there is no particular Perswasion established by Law; and consequently all Perswasions there are upon an equal bottom of Liberty, as I find to be the Case with <HI>New-York,</HI> where there is not one Act of Assembly, wherein the name or manner of Worship as it is in the Church of <HI>England</HI> is so much as expressed: And where there is no legal Establishment or any penalties or restrictions on the Liberty of any Dissenters, there is no room for, or need of any Toleration; for where no penalty, what must we be tolerated from; but pure nullities, or nothings, which seems inconsist∣ent with the thing it self: Therefore in <HI>New-York</HI> Government all Per∣swasions there are upon an equal level, and bottom of liberty; and this confirmed to all Dissenters, except Papists, and allowed by an Act of Assembly, already read in open Court. And if <HI>Jews,</HI> who openly blas∣pheme the Lord Jesus, <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Lutherans,</HI> and all other or most per∣swasions are allowed even in this Government; it is matter of wonder, and I can know no reason, why we only should not be allowed of, but put to molestation as we now are, by my present prosecution: Is it be∣cause we are Protestants? Is it because we are likest the Established Church of <HI>England</HI> of any Dissenters? Is it because we are the most considerable Body of Protestants in the Queens Dominions? Is it be∣cause we have now since the Union, a National Establishment in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as nighly related and annexed unto the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> as the Church of <HI>England</HI> themselves? Sure such Proceedings, when known, will and must be a prodigy to <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="33" REF="001300_0037_0FB27B8845062DB8"/>Mr. Attorney replied, it was impossible for any man to answer all which was offered, there was so much delivered, and by so many.</P>
<P>The Defendant told Mr. Attorney, he verily believed it was impossi∣ble for Mr. Attorney to answer what was said, and that it was a great truth Mr. Attorney asserted.</P>
<P>Mr. Attorney proceeds to answer, and says: These Gentlemen on the other side assert all the Paenal Laws of <HI>England</HI> are local &amp; limited to <HI>England, Wales,</HI> and <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed;</HI> but I shall produce one that is not so, but extends to all the Queens Dominions; and that is the Act of Uniformity, made the first of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which is demonstrated from the very words of said Law, <HI>or other place within this Realm of England, Wales, and the Marches of the same,</HI> and <HI>other the QUEENS Dominions:</HI> And flies to the Instructions again, and endeavours to as∣sert and vindicate the Supremacy, and says, the Kings and Queens of <HI>England,</HI> Enjoin and Command their Governours to grant Licences; and it has always been customary, and an universal practice to take Li∣cences from Governours: And those Ministers who come from other places, must be the same that my Ld. is to allow Liberty of Consci∣ence unto.</P>
<P>The Defendant begged leave to answer the Attorney as to his last Argument, as to the first of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which is the Act of Uniformity; we acknowledge it was extensive to the Queens Dominions in general, and not limited to <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> only; yet I hope to make it ap∣pear, this Act does no way affect the Plantations, and far less affect Dis∣senters; therfore is altogether foreign to our present purpose. For 1. That Act of Parliament was made in the first year of the Reign of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and consequently before any Plantation had a being, or was thought of, and so could have no relation to them at all, they being pure non-entities at that time. 2. All over the Act, and in sundry pla∣ces thereof, it is directed to Ministers, Parsons or Vicars in Cathedrals, Parish-Churches, Private Chappels, or Oratories; and not a word in the whole Act of Dissenters or Conventicles. For 3. At that time, when this Act was made, there were not strictly and properly speaking, any number of Dissenters in <HI>England,</HI> who held Separate Meetings from the Publick and Established Worship; for tho' there were those in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who always from the beginning of the Reformation scrupled the use of all the Common Prayer, and omitted some Cere∣monies, which was, and is to this day, the grounds of the Separation; and it was to oblige such to an Uniformity in Publick Worship. And as soon as the Act was made, and put in Execution, with all its penalties,
<PB N="34" REF="001300_0038_0FB27B89C6C3CFC0"/>
many were discouraged, others Cast out of the Church, for Noncon∣formity; and this really made the Separation, and all the mischiefs of the Separation are originally owing to this Act; tho' as soon as the Se∣paration was made, they could not touch Dissenters by the penalties of this Act, therefore were under a necessity of making new Acts of Parlia∣ment in the following Reigns, for punishing Separated Dissenters; all which were limited and local in express words; and never designed to pursue Persecuted Persons to an <HI>American</HI> Wilderness. 4. I am able to make it appear, if this Act of Uniformity were strictly put in Executi∣on, the most of the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> would fall un∣der its lashes and penalties; for none of them are to use any other Rite, Ceremony, or open Prayer, but what is mentioned and set forth, in the said Book of Common-Prayer. And it is well known, the most valuable men in that Church use another Publick Prayer, then is in Common Prayer, and all such persons are so far Dissenters, and being in Communion with the Church of <HI>England,</HI> are only liable to be Prosecuted upon this Statute.</P>
<P>And as to the Queens Instructions, which Mr. Attorney insists so much upon, it was, and is obvious to every man, they were two distinct In∣structions; and tho' we have them placed so near in this Copy, they have no affinity one to another; and it is not fair for Mr. Attorney to take the latter clause of one Instruction, and join it to another, which was before; this is a Curtailing the Queens Instructions: whereas those who composed them, knew better how to join them together, then Mr. Attorney does.</P>
<P>And whereas Mr. Attorney affirms, that giving and taking Licence was very common and universal; I am well assured there never was, neither is to this day any such practice in any Plantation of <HI>America;</HI> and there were but few persons, as yet in <HI>York</HI> Government that had Li∣cences; for besides the two <HI>Dutch</HI> Ministers, who differ upon <HI>Long-I∣sland,</HI> and it is said Licences are the cause of their difference; there is but one <HI>English</HI> Nonconformist Minister, in all the Government, who has taken a Licence, and it is as certain, Mr. <HI>Dubois,</HI> and sundry others of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Churches has no Licence, neither will submit to any such as are granted.</P>
<P>Mr. Attorney perceiving how matters then stood, moves that the Ju∣ry should bring in a special Verdict, and the Judges inclined thereunto; for says Mr. Attorney, the matter of fact is plainly confessed by the De∣fendant, as you have heard, and you are to bring it in specially, for you are not Judges of Law.</P>

<P>May it please your Honours, I am a Stranger, who live four hundred miles from this place, and it is known to the whole Country, what intollerable trouble I have been put to already, and we cannot consent to a special Verdict, for that is only to encrease my trou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, multiply my Charge, and give me further delay: And it is a known truth in Law, that Strangers are to be favoured always with expedition in Justice, and does no way approve of delays; and if this should be allowed of, no mans innocence is able to protect him; for if I am clea∣red, I should suffer more in Charges at last, then if I were really guilty of the breach of many Paenal Laws of <HI>England:</HI> And as to the Juries judging of Law, and confessing the fact, I cannot see one point of the Law to be judged; for that the Paenal are local and limited, that is owned on all hands, and Paenal Laws are strictly to be taken and inter∣preted, and not allowed to the ruin of the Subject, to extend, or be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦terpreted beyond the plain and strict sense of the words.

<P>I must confess, the Case is very different; for it is the opinion and constitution of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that notwithstanding their Ordination, they are not to Preach or Officiate as Ministers, until they procure, or have a Licence from their Bishop, or Ordinary, which no Dissenting Minister is concerned with; and they voluntarily and freely bring themselves under an Oath of Canonical Obedience, to obey their Ordinary; and if he require them to take Licences, or any thing else they must, they are sworn to submit thereunto. But finally, There is a great deal of reason, why Ministers of the Church of <HI>England</HI> should
<PB N="36" REF="001300_0040_0FB27B8FC2E397F0"/>
submit to Licence, but we are not; because it is only <HI>bare liberty</HI> which Dissenters have; but they have not only <HI>Liberty,</HI> but a considerable <HI>Maintainance</HI> also; without which, I never knew any of them value Liberty only; and Dissenters having liberty only without any Main∣tenance from the Government, are not at all under obligations, neither is it required of them to take Licences of any.</P>
</SP>
<P>After a long debate and fair pleadings, The Honourable <HI>Roger Mem∣pesson,</HI> Chief Justice, applies himself to the Jury, to this effect: Gentle∣men, <HI>You have heard a great deal on both sides, and Mr. Attorney says the fact is confessed by the Defendant, and I would have you bring it in specially, for there are some points I am not now prepared to answer; How far Instructions may go, in having the force of a Law, especially when not published, or made known: And there is one objection made by Mr.</HI> Makemie, <HI>and that is the Oath of Supremacy of</HI> England <HI>is abolished; &amp; how far it will go in this matter, I confess I am not prepared to answer: If you will take upon you to judge of Law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the fact specially: This is the first Instance I can learn, has been of a Tryal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prosecution of this nature in</HI> America.</P>
<P>The Jury desired the Act of Assembly of <HI>New-York</HI> might be delivered to them; and the Defendant desired the Jury might have the Queens Instructions also, which Mr. Attorney opposed and denied.</P>
<P>There is a Constable Sworn to attend the Jury, who withdraws, and in a very short time returned again.</P>
<P>The Jury is called, and finds the Defendant Not Guilty.</P>
<P>The Court begun to enquire Reasons for the Jury's Verdict, but the Chief Justice told the Jury, they might give Reasons if they would, &amp; they might choose whether they would or not give any Reasons for their Verdict. The Foreman told the Court, the Defendant had not transgressed any Law: Another person of the Jury told the Court, they believed in their Consciences, they had done the Defendant Justice, &amp; so the Verdict was confirmed.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Reign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Attorney for the Defendant, moved, that the Defendant might be discharged; which was by the Chief Justice referred till to morrow morning.</P>

<P>The Defendant told the Court, it was an hard case, that an innocent person, and one found so upon Tryal, and by Law, and suffering so much already, and not only innocently, but for doing of good, should pay so severe Fees at last.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="001300_0041_0FB27B9AAD3889C0"/>At length the Defendant was willing to pay all just and legal Fees to the Court, and Officers thereof, who acted indifferently in their several Offices, as to this matter, but it was unreasonable, he should pay his Pro∣secutors, whatsoever they were pleased to demand; this was nothing less, then hiring our Enemies to ruin us; but it being the practice, as they affirmed, no Arguments would be received.</P>
<P>The Defendant further told the Court, if he must pay Fees, as he was a Stranger, prayed he might not be left to the Arbitrary Demands of Officers; but that the Bill of Cost might be produced, and examined in open Court, and taxed by the Judges. But the Chief Justice decl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ning it, as a thing he did not concern himself with: It was referred to <HI>Robert Millward</HI> Esqr. one of the Assistant Judges, who was to tax the Bill, after notice given to the Defendant or his Attorney, of the time &amp; place to make their objections: But the Bill was taxed by said Judge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without any such notice given; and instead of moderating any Arti∣cles, added two new ones. And their full account was paid, and a Co∣py of said Account denied the Defendant, and a Receipt upon payment of Money refused, tho' paid in presence of two Witnesses.</P>

So this is to enlighten, not only those abroad in the World, but also influence and direct the Assemblys of <HI>New-York</HI> for the future; in not giving a handle to any, to pervert their Laws, contrary to the intention of the Legislators, for confirming by subsequent Acts, in their unjust possessions; all which they may perceive from the following particu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1. This Law is no general for the whole Government, but for four Counties of a Colony where there are nine Counties; so that the largest share is yet without the benefits of this Act. 2. It was made upon the motion and appli∣cation of sundry Dissenters, on <HI>Long-Island,</HI> yet alive, who expected a∣nother benefit by it, then they have been since treated with. 3. It was made by an Assembly generally Dissenters, and are so to this day; and let such as are alive declare their design in this Law. 4. There is not any mention of so much as the name of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or the mode or manner of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Worship, Government or Ceremonies in all the Law, without which, I cannot imagine they can have any Establishment. 5. Every sufficient Protestant Minister, duly called according to directions of said Law, has a right hereunto, and none else, and that Dissenters for whom this Law was originally de∣signed, are deemed and called Ministers, and men in Holy Orders, is plain from the express words of the Act of Toleration. 6. None have a right unto, or should have any benefit by this Act, but he that is cal∣led and chosen by twelve men, chosen by the free Votes of the people of the County which Mr. <HI>Urqhart</HI> of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> never had by any Vote of the majority; therefore has as great a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight to the Salary there, as he has to the Meeting-House, with the House &amp; Land he lives upon, of which the Proprietors have been Ousted with violence, without all legal Process or Ejectment; and being of 1500 <HI>l.</HI> value. It is matter of sati∣faction this practice is singular, and not yet made a President of, tho' <HI>New-Town</HI> is threatened by the same Parson. 7. It is observable, at the time this Law was made, there was not a Church of <HI>England</HI> Clergy-man
<PB N="44" REF="001300_0048_0FB27BAA12E68810"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in all that Country, and for some time after. 8. As no person had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>right by this Law, but such legally called, and chosen so consequent∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was no crime for the Vestry to refuse levying or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng money to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is had no right. 9. By <HI>English</HI> Law, and Practice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Vestry men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed as culpable, until legally convi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the crime, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter of fact. 10. By the last clause of this Law, all former Agree∣ments made between Ministers and People, were confirmed and ratify∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and all such were then, and are to this day, <HI>Dutch, French,</HI> and <HI>Bri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Dissenters. So much concerning <HI>New-York</HI> Act of Assembly.</P>
<P>As to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>English</HI> Act of Parliament, I shall say nothing, but leave that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Queens-Bench,</HI> and the Learned Judges there, when the crimeless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittimus, and till further order comes to be tryed by them.</P>
<P>The next Copy is a <HI>New-York</HI> Licence, not so common and general <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dissenters, as Mr. Attorney asserted at the Tryal; for if they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> called in, they would make but a small number, and any may have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em for half the money they cost; and with some not so easily swal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed down, as Conformity, for which we dissent: And for these Rea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns. 1. If we are not Ministers before, this Licence can never make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so. 2. No such Instructions from the Queen was produced at the Tryal, as laid Dissenters under any obligations of taking Licences. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y this Licence they are only tolerated to exercise their Religion in one Congregation, and allows not a liberty to Preach to any People <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the whole Government, who shall desire it, which no Minister in his right wit for the future, will submit to 4. It is a most precarious liber∣ty, which is granted, not, <HI>Quamdiu bene se gesserit,</HI> but during pleasure; which is inconsistent with that Commission and Authority; which Mi∣nisters of the Gospel, called of God, derive from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Head and King of his Militant Churches: Therefore it is from a principle of Conscience, and not from any contempt of Government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> disrespect to the persons of any in Authority, that they cannot, they dare not submit to such a Licence, so inconsistent with the toleration, and that liberty of Conscience allowed in <HI>Britain,</HI> and practised in all the Queens Dominions, besides <HI>New-York,</HI> and commanded to be allow∣ed by the Queens Instructions.</P>
<P>The next thing to be taken notice of in this Postscript, is a Copy of Mr. <HI>Makemies</HI> Certificate from a Court of Record in the Dominion of <HI>Virginia;</HI> which was produced to, and read by Ld. <HI>Cornbury,</HI> before Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment, and shown to the Grand Jury, before the Presentment was found: And tho' Mr. Attorney told the said Jury, while four of the Hearers were examining upon Oath concerning the Sermon, this
<PB N="45" REF="001300_0049_0FB27BAC2D4591B0"/>
Certificate was writ under a Hedge, which no doubt influenced them to have no regard thereunto: Yet if the Act of Toleration, and conse∣quently this Certificate had come in play at the Tryal, he was armed with an Exemplification from the Government, signed by the Praesident, and the Seal of the Colony annext, to prove the truth and validity of this Certificate, and vindicate it from Forgery.</P>
<P>The last thing is an account of the Expences, of not only a person who is innocent, but for doing good, as was determined by the Tryal; and in complying with the most solemn obligations of duty, both to God, and the Souls of men. To which, besides loss of time, and ab∣sence from his Family and Concerns, he might have justly charged <HI>Twelve Pounds</HI> more Money, by being necessiated to make his Escape, both by Land and Water to <HI>New-England,</HI> from Office with new Pre∣cepts, whereby a whole Sabbath was prophaned, in seeking to appre∣hend him; for which some must be accountable.</P>
<P>But it is plain and undeniable, that the Prosecution of the most in∣nocent person in the world at <HI>New-York</HI> is more expensive, then if Mr. <HI>Makemie</HI> had been guilty of all the Paenal Laws mustered up, in the In∣dictment against one Sermon, if prosecuted in <HI>England,</HI> even while P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦nal Laws were in force, and Executed there.</P>
<P>And a fair and legal decision, cannot put an end to a Controversy where the same fact is made criminal, and a new Process violently de∣signed, and vigorously aimed at, by such, as nothing but the interpos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on of the Authority of <HI>England</HI> will put a stop to.</P>
<P>And what legal Authority Mr. Attorney, and a perpetual Sheriff have for their demanded Fees, I leave to the Regulated. Table of Fees <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>New-York</HI> to determine; not to be paralelled by any Colony in H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Majesty's Dominions.</P>

<SALUTE>May it please Your Lordship,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Most humbly beg leave to Represent to Your Excellency my just astonishment at the Information received from sundry hands since my arrival in these Colonies, and after so long and so expensive a Confinement, so deliberate and fair a Tryal, before Judges of Your Lordships appointment, and by a Jury Chosen by your own Sheriff, on purpose to try that matter: I have been legally cleared, and found guilty of no Crime for Preaching a Sermon at <HI>New-York,</HI> though my innocence protected me not from unspeakable and intollerable Expence.</P>
<P>I am informed, <HI>may it please your Excellency,</HI> there are Orders and Dire∣ctions given to sundry Officers in the <HI>Jerseys,</HI> for apprehending me, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> design of giving me fresh trouble at <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>If I were assured of the true cause of Your Lordships repeated Re∣sentments against me, I doubt not but my Innocence, would not only effectually justify me, but remove those impressions imposed on Your Lordship by some persons about you.</P>
<P>And as to my Preaching, being found at the Tryal, against no Law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or any ways inconsistent with Her Majesty's Instructions produced there; and considering the solemn Obligations I am under, both to God, and the Souls of men, to embrace all opportunities for exercising <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ministerial Gifts vouchsafed from Heaven; to whom I do ap∣peal, I have no other end, besides the Glory of God, and the Eternal Good o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Previous Souls: I must assure my self Your Lordship insists not on the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a Crime, especially in <HI>New-York</HI> Government, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts are upon an equal level of Liberty, and no legal Esta∣blishment for any particular Perswasion.</P>
<P>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I am Charged with the <HI>Jersey</HI> Paper, Call'd, <HI>Forge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and For¦<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> tho' the proving a Negative in my just Vindication be an hard Task, and not an usual undertaking; yet doubt not but the thing it self, the matter it contains being foreign to me, and no way concerned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e: the time of its publication, being so soon spread abroad after my arrival; I am well assured, none dare legally accuse me, while the Au∣thors

smile at Your Lordships mistake and imposition, whose Informers deserve to be stigmatized with the severest marks of Your Lordships Displeasure; and the Authors will find a time to confront my sworn Accusers of Perjury; and besides that, I never saw it till about the last of <HI>February:</HI> We have suffered greatly in our Reputations, and particu∣larly by being branded with the Character of <HI>Jesuits;</HI> tho' my univer∣sal known Reputation in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> makes me easy under such inviduous imputations: I have been represented to Your Lordship as being factious in the Government, both of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have peaceably lived in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and I brought from <HI>Maryland</HI> a Cer∣tificate of my past Reputation, signed by some of the best Quality on the most Contiguous County, ready to be produced at the Tryal, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there had been occasion for it: A Copy of which I presume to In∣close for Your Lordships perusal and satisfaction.</P>
<P>I beg leave to represent to Your Lordship my just concern at the sundry Precepts for apprehending me, both in <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Jerseys,</HI> as one of the greatest Criminals; whereby I am prevented in performing my Ministerial Duties to many in Your Lordships Government of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own Perswasion, who desire it. I shall patiently expect Your Lordship<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Commands</HI> and <HI>Directions,</HI> in giving me an opportunity for Vindicating of my self in what is charged against me, and being always ready to comply with any Qualification enjoined and required by Law.</P>
