<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE following <HI>Sermons,</HI> plain and simple as they are, for <HI>Mourning</HI> forbids Or∣nament, had been publish'd <HI>sooner,</HI> if at all, after the <HI>Funeral</HI> of my dear Child, if the putting in Order some <HI>Memoirs</HI> of her short <HI>Exemplary Life</HI> had not obliged us to some <HI>Delay.</HI></P>
<P>I hope both the <HI>Sermons</HI> and the <HI>Memoirs</HI> may be of good Use to <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> and to <HI>Ministers</HI> and their Children in particular, or I should not trouble the <HI>Public</HI> with them.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Father</HI> of the <HI>Deceased</HI> I owe this Respect unto her Memory, but more as a <HI>Minister</HI> I owe it to the Children of my <HI>Country</HI> and of the <HI>Town.</HI> It becomes Me now <HI>in Age</HI> to write for <HI>Those</HI> un∣to Whom I have been ministring these <HI>five and thirty</HI> Years; and I <HI>magnify my Office</HI> (to bor∣row the Words of the Great <HI>Apostle) if I may

provoke to Emulation those that are my Flesh.</HI> I mean, If what is here publish'd may serve to put <HI>Parents</HI> on more <HI>early</HI> and continued Endeavours for the Souls of their Children, and to inspire our <HI>Dau'ters</HI> in particular with <HI>Desires</HI> to improve in Knowlege and Goodness under the Instructions of their wise and gracious Parents. <HI>This,</HI> by the Will of God, ought to be to me <HI>a Joy</HI> next to any <HI>Saving Ministrations to my own Offspring,</HI> whereof the following <HI>Record</HI> gives me some humble <HI>Hope:</HI> Scil. That it has pleased God to make Me, together with my good Son Mr. <HI>Turell,</HI> a <HI>Spiritual Father</HI> to my lov'd Child, and that <HI>in Christ Jesus</HI> we <HI>have begotten her thro' the Gospel;</HI> (again to use the <HI>Apostle's</HI> most <HI>pleasant</HI> Words) — At least the <HI>Reader</HI> will charitably judge that I have with some Pains and Throws <HI>been travailing in Birth till Christ was formed in her.</HI> In which I be∣seech <HI>Others</HI> to be <HI>Followers</HI> of me, who yet am not <HI>worthy</HI> to be named among the <HI>Ministers of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>For I have at last very <HI>poorly</HI> answered that <HI>first and great Commandment</HI> of God to all his People, <HI>Deut. vi. 4,—7. "Hear, O Israel, The Lord our God is one Lord! And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Might: And these Words which I command thee this Day shall be in thine Heart, and THOU SHALT TEACH THEM DILIGENTLY UNTO THY CHILDREN, &amp;c.</HI> See how much true Love to <HI>God</HI> lies &amp; shows it self in our Care for the Souls of our <HI>Posterity!</HI> and how much He will account this in us Love to <HI>Himself.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="003888_0004_100305A5B3EED878"/>My <HI>Deceased</HI> has it may be better answer'd the Commandment of God to <HI>Children,</HI> Prov. <HI>iv. 1. "Hear the Instruction of a Father, and attend to know Understanding";</HI> and could with true Delight take up the following Words, <HI>"For I was my Father's—, tender and only beloved in the Sight of my Mother; He taught me also and said to me, Let thy Heart retain my Words, keep my Commandments and live: "Get Wis∣dom, get Understanding, forget it not, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>O might we see many, <HI>many</HI> of our Sons and Daughters answering to <HI>this Original</HI> in the Book of God, this <HI>wisest</HI> of the Sons of Men, in a much <HI>superiour</HI> Measure to what my <HI>Deceased</HI> did in her Childhood and Youth!</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> of these Sermons was composed <HI>on the Sudden Death of her dear Mother,</HI> and she sat at my <HI>Feet</HI> and heard it in her great <HI>Mourning,</HI> with some Character of her lov'd <HI>Parent;</HI> whose <HI>Cares for her Soul</HI> she records with great Thankfulness to God in some of her <HI>Papers.</HI> And when Mr. <HI>Turell</HI> prevail'd with me to come &amp; <HI>weep</HI> with Him &amp; his People, the Sabbath after the Funeral of his <HI>Wife,</HI> I chose to repeat <HI>that</HI> Sermon to my <HI>Self</HI> &amp; <HI>Him;</HI> adapting it to the <HI>Communion</HI> which then fell in Curse.</P>
<P>The <HI>other</HI> Sermon I had preach'd at <HI>Home</HI> the Lord's Day before, and now I make the <HI>DEDI∣CATION of both,</HI> first to the <HI>Beloved Children</HI> of my own <HI>Flock</HI> and <HI>Town,</HI> and then to the Be∣loved People of <HI>Medford,</HI> to Whom I gave away no small part of <HI>the Light of my Eyes</HI> in the Day I married her to their <HI>Pastor.</HI></P>

<HEAD>An EPISTLE To the Reverend Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Turell,</HI> Occasioned by the <HI>Death</HI> Of his late Virtuous CONSORT. By the Reverend Mr. JOHN ADAMS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHY hangs such Sorrow on your pensive Brow?</L>
<L>Say <HI>Turell,</HI> why the Tears so freely flow?</L>
<L>If you lament the lovely Partner fled,</L>
<L>In vain you heave the Sighs, or Rivers shed.</L>
<L>The Darts of Death within her Bosom deep</L>
<L>Have urg'd the fatal Wound, and fix'd the lasting Sleep.</L>
<L>Th' impartial Tyrant round his Arrows throws,</L>
<L>Nor heeds our Pray'rs, nor melts before our Vows.</L>
<L>The Charms of Beauty wither from his Hands,</L>
<L>As fades a Flower, and to a Tempest bends.</L>
<L>Nor Eloquence can sooth, nor Virtue awe,</L>
<L>Nor Force repell the Pow'r of Nature's Law.</L>
<L>To Limits fix'd, our destin'd Course we bend,</L>
<L>And with resistless Haste to Death's pale Empire tend.</L>
<L>From Scene to Scene our shifting Moments go,</L>
<L>And then return the Ground the Dust we owe.</L>
<L>As glides the pictur'd Dream before our Sight,</L>
<L>Wing'd with the fleeting Shadows of the Night,</L>
<L><PB N="ii" REF="003888_0007_1003057AC4C84610"/>So born upon the quick succeeding Hours</L>
<L>We drop in Death, and drink surviving Showers.</L>
<L>Adown our Cheeks th' unwearied Currents shed</L>
<L>Can ne'r revive, but may increase the Dead.</L>
<L>Had you the Lyre of <HI>Orpheus,</HI> which could move</L>
<L>The quickned Stones, and each attentive Grove;</L>
<L>Or could you flow in such a moving Strain</L>
<L>As <HI>Turell</HI> warbled to the listning Plain;</L>
<L>In vain the tender Plaints would charm her Ears,</L>
<L>Bound to the breathing Consort of the Spheres.</L>
<L>Who would the doubtful Maze of Life repeat,</L>
<L>Where flattering Scenes the guilded Fancy cheat?</L>
<L>Where Cares and Sorrows circle thro' our Years,</L>
<L>While future Evils rise before our Fears?</L>
<L>And feel the Fires of heavenly Rapture die,</L>
<L>And blot with Tears the Visions of the Sky?</L>
<L>None that had tasted of sublimer Springs,</L>
<L>Could feel a Thirst for these inferiour Things.</L>
<L>As who a Lawn, distinct with silver Rills,</L>
<L>Would change for burning Sands, or broken Hills?</L>
<L>Or in the Covert of a lonely Cell</L>
<L>From all the beauteous Realms of <HI>Phoebus</HI> Steal;</L>
<L>When smiling Prospects and unfading Greens</L>
<L>Courted his Sight with their enamell'd Scenes,</L>
<L>And all the Arch of Heaven's expanded Sky</L>
<L>Burnt with unnumber'd Glories to his Eye?</L>
<L>Thro' Death's dark Valley, winding out her Way,</L>
<L>The Saint has opened to a Blaze of Day.</L>
<L>The Shades, now nearer, hang upon your Sight,</L>
<L>But still they border on eternal Light.</L>
<L>So when the gathering Clouds the Skies deform</L>
<L>The Air is dark, and Nature wears the Storm,</L>
<L>While all above is spread a smooth Serene,</L>
<L>And ting'd with Light the gilded Vapours shine.</L>
<L>Let not those Glories which should bring Relief</L>
<L>Expire in Shades, and fade in Floods of Gri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f.</L>

<L>Nature had shed upon her ample Mind</L>
<L>It's various Gifts, which Art had well refin'd.</L>
<L>In her, <HI>paternal Touches</HI> you might trace</L>
<L>To shape her Mind, and form each future Grace:</L>
<L>And soon her Virtues into Prospect rais'd</L>
<L>The <HI>Father</HI>'s Care, but most the GOD confess'd.</L>
<L>He smooth'd her Strains, and tun'd her sacred Lyre,</L>
<L>And breath'd within her Soul Seraphick Fire.</L>
<L>Even now, the flowing Numbers left behind</L>
<L>Reflect the Features of her virtuous Mind.</L>
<L>Nor yet of all the Nymphs that grace the Plain,</L>
<L>Has one appear'd to sing so sweet a Strain.</L>
<L>But most, <HI>Devotion</HI> did its Power diffuse,</L>
<L>Soul of her Soul, the Spirit of her Muse.</L>
<L>Of all her heavenly Tempers this was chief,</L>
<L>Liv'd in her Heart, and liv'd within her Life.</L>
<L>Witness her Closet, whence her glowing Prayers,</L>
<L>Wing'd with celestial Vigour, reach'd her Father's Ears.</L>
<L>There GOD vouchsaf'd to be her frequent Guest,</L>
<L>And sunk in Calms the Tumults of her Breast.</L>
<L>Happy, when thus retir'd from human Eyes,</L>
<L>New Scenes of Glory open'd from the Skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Free from Ambition She despis'd the Charms</L>
<L>Of tempting Riches, circled in its Arms;</L>
<L>But lov'd the Silence of the rural Scenes,</L>
<L>And oft would rove amidst th' embroider'd Greens;</L>
<L>Where <HI>Zephyrs</HI> fann'd her with their cooling Wings,</L>
<L>And Birds in Consort sung with murmuring Springs.</L>
<L>There She could move thro' Nature's artful Maze,</L>
<L>And contemplate on what the Simple gaze.</L>
<L>Ah fade ye Greens! and weep ye gliding Rills!</L>
<L>Droop all ye Flow'rs! in Vapour rise ye Hills!</L>
<L>Ye Zephyrs into mourning Murmurs turn,</L>
<L>And gather Clouds for Tears for <HI>Turell's</HI> Urn!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The tender Tyes of <HI>nuptial</HI> Life She grac'd,</L>
<L>And all the <HI>Mother</HI> to the Child express'd:</L>
<L>The best of <HI>Daughters</HI> in her Carriage shone,</L>
<L>She felt the <HI>Friend,</HI> and charm'd the weeping Town.</L>
<L><PB N="iv" REF="003888_0009_10030592EA848580"/>Few were her Words, but chose and weighty too,</L>
<L>We could not blame, but griev'd they were so few.</L>
<L>A steady Wisdom led her cautious Life,</L>
<L>Conceal'd the Whisper, and forbid the Strife.</L>
<L>Deep Contemplation ting'd her serious Mind,</L>
<L>Broke thro' her Eyes, and in her Aspect shin'd.</L>
<L>Nor did her stedfast Virtue 'ere refuse,</L>
<L>In gayer Hours her graver Thoughts to lose;</L>
<L>Nor Wit to lend its Aid to Innocence,</L>
<L>To raise our Pleasure, and to point her Sense.</L>
<L>Politely read, what various Books she knew?</L>
<L>Which on her Mind unfading Traces drew.</L>
<L>Nor was She vain, nor stain'd with those Neglects,</L>
<L>In which too learned Females lose their Sex.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now, ah! now, the heavy Shades of Night</L>
<L>Have seal'd her Eyes, and sunk her from our Sight.</L>
<L>Th' Etherial Picture has forsook our Eyes,</L>
<L>To gain the perfect Touch within the Skies.</L>
<L>There all the Shadows will appear below,</L>
<L>But all above the heightned Features glow.</L>
<L>Nor could the fainter Light our Sphere imparts</L>
<L>Reveal the Beauties which the Draught asserts.</L>
<L>Now, in a proper Point of Vision plac'd,</L>
<L>The kindled Graces are to Life express'd.</L>

<L>Fain would the <HI>Muse</HI> her Plaintive Numbers cease,</L>
<L>And lose her Sorrows in these Realms of Bliss.</L>

<L>Sure you would weep, ye tender Offspring! too;</L>
<L>But Years forbid the Stream to Nature due.</L>

<L>The Bosom, whence he drew the vital Tyde.</L>

<L>Ah! why ye Bards! is <HI>Taylor's</HI> Hapless Hearse,</L>
<L>Undeck'd with Garlands of unfading Verse!</L>
<L>She lov'd your Strains; your springing Bays would rise,</L>
<L>Green with the falling Showr's of friendly Eyes.</L>
<L>Fair was her Face, but fairer was her Mind,</L>
<L>Where all the Muses, all the Graces join'd.</L>
<L>For tender Passions turn'd, and soft to please,</L>
<L>With all the graceful Negligence of Ease.</L>
<L>Her Soul was form'd for nicer Arts of Life,</L>
<L>To shew the Friend, but most to grace the Wife.</L>
<L>O had kind Heaven her longer Glories lent,</L>
<L>And spar'd the plaintive Tears which now are spent!</L>
<L>And may these Numbers, dying o're her Urn,</L>
<L>Excite some softer Muse her Fate to mourn.</L>

<L>While Joys Immortal widen in their Breast,</L>
<L>And Heavenly Visions charm the Stranger Blest.</L>

<L>Ah! should our Eyes be dim with bursting Tears,</L>
<L>When Heaven's surrounding Landskip spreads on Theirs?</L>
<L>What mean the Murmurs of our pensive Moan?</L>
<L>Hear Their melodious Music warble down;</L>
<L>While all the Rivers of their Joy upbraid</L>
<L>Those Tears which only for our Selves are shed.</L>
<L>Their snowy Robes, which drink celestial Light,</L>
<L>Should thro' the shades of Mourning strike our Sight,</L>

<L>The falling Drops with living Colours dies,</L>
<L>And every Glory glitters thro' the Skies;</L>

<HEAD>Aaron<HI>'s Silence</HI> On the <HI>Death</HI> of his SONS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>LEVITICUS X. 3.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And Aaron held his Peace.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>VERY gracious and exemplary was <HI>this Silence of Aaron,</HI> and very awful was the Providence and <HI>Trial</HI> which made it so excellent and admirable in him. <HI>He</HI> and his <HI>Sons</HI> having been called of <HI>God</HI> unto the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> and solemnly conse∣crated to the service of the <HI>Sanctuary</HI>; upon the first Execution of their Office the <HI>Glory of the Lord</HI> appeared unto all the People, and a <HI>Fire</HI> came from before the <HI>Lord</HI> and consumed the Burnt-Offering upon the <HI>Altar.</HI> This was a most open and glorious Testimony of the <HI>Lord's</HI> accepting of his Sanctuary and Altar, his Priests also and the worshipping People. Well might it fill them all with transports of Joy, and make them <HI>shout</HI> and <HI>fall on their Faces.</HI> So they a∣dor'd and gave Thanks to the <HI>King Eternal and Invisible,</HI> who vouchsaf'd thus to manifest Him∣self to them, and show 'em His Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003888_0013_100317FE42A24D18"/>But the Sin and Sudden Death of <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu</HI> (the two Sons of <HI>Aaron</HI> who had been dignified among <HI>the Elders of Israel,</HI> and <HI>by Name</HI> called up into the <HI>Mount,</HI> to <HI>see the God of Israel, and He laid not his Hand on them</HI>; Exod. xxiv. 1, 11.) gave a dreadful <HI>Damp</HI> to the Joys of that glorious Day.</P>
<P>These <HI>young Priests,</HI> proud it may be of their <HI>Office,</HI> and half intoxicated with the Joy of the sacred <HI>Festival,</HI> took either of them his <HI>Censer,</HI> probably without the Divine Order to burn In∣cense at that Time; and whereas they should have taken of the Fire that was newly kindled on the Altar <HI>from before the Lord,</HI> they offer'd <HI>strange Fire,</HI> us'd common Fire, <HI>which He com∣manded them not.</HI></P>
<P>This was a great piece of Rashness, Irreve∣rence and Presumption in them; and being the <HI>first</HI> Profanation of <HI>God's</HI> House and Worship by the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> it pleas'd the <HI>Holy and Dreadful Majesty</HI> to strike 'em dead upon the spot. <HI>There went out Fire from the Lord and devoured 'em, and they died before the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>This was such a kind of Bereavement as ne∣ver but once hapned, enough to swallow up all Words! and no doubt but <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> and all the worshipping Assembly were struck with Astonishment at the terrible Execution. But <HI>Moses</HI> inspir'd of God, with a Presence of Mind as surprising as the present Event, immediately shewed them that so it became the <HI>Holiness of God</HI> to sanctify Himself on them that came nigh Him, if they did not take care to sanctify his Name in their Approaches to Him and Ministra∣tions before him: ver. 3. <HI>Then Moses said unto
<PB N="3" REF="003888_0014_10031827AE280658"/>
Aaron, This is it that the Lord spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the People I will be glorified: And Aaron held his Peace.</HI></P>
<P>So <HI>Aaron</HI> hearkned to the Word of God, from the Mouth of his Brother <HI>Moses,</HI> and was <HI>dumb</HI> because God had done it in his wise and righ∣teous Severity: So he <HI>sanctified</HI> the Lord, and glorified Him before all the People, in adoring Silence and profound Submission.</P>
<P>This was as indeed became the <HI>High Priest</HI> of the Lord. What an <HI>Example</HI> did he give to the frighted gazing Congregation! But he did no more than was his Duty, nor all that neither. It was of God's great Grace and Mercy to him that he bare as he did. Let God have all the Glory, and <HI>Aaron</HI> his praise also; for God put Honour on him, glorified his Grace in him.</P>
<P>It is the Duty of all Men, more especially of <HI>Ministers,</HI> to be Silent under Divine Corrections. <Q>Not only to bear, but to <HI>accept</HI> of the Punish∣ment of Sin. And the most effectual Argu∣ments, for silencing and quieting a gracious Heart under Affliction, are those that are fetch'd from God's Glory.</Q> The Holy One had sanctified his own Name, &amp; vindicated the Glory of it: This silenc'd <HI>Aaron.</HI> <Q>God was glorified and <HI>Aaron</HI> is satisfied.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctrines I would briefly speak to are, 1. That there is a gracious <HI>Silence</HI> which may highly become us in our sorrowful <HI>Bereavements</HI>; more especially when they are <HI>sudden</HI> &amp; awful, and carry much of God's holy Anger and Dis∣pleasure in them. 2. That <HI>Ministers</HI> especially
<PB N="4" REF="003888_0015_100318024FB2A958"/>
should be Instances and <HI>Examples</HI> hereof under such Bereavements.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> There is a gracious <HI>Silence</HI> which may high∣ly become us in our sorrowful <HI>Bereavements,</HI> more especially when they are <HI>sudden</HI> and awful, and carry much of God's Holy Anger &amp; Displeasure in them.</P>
<P><HI>Such</HI> was this of <HI>Aaron's</HI> in the Text: To have <HI>two Sons,</HI> just consecrated to the Service of God, suddenly struck Dead, as it were by Light∣ning, and that because the Holy God was not serv'd by 'em in that reverend Manner which he requir'd,—What could be more surprizing, more awful and expressive of Divine Displea∣sure?</P>
<P>The <HI>first Death,</HI> the first Bereavement of the <HI>first Parents</HI> of Mankind, was a very sudden and awful Breach upon them! And no doubt but <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> tho't God very angry with them, when they saw one Son, and him a godly one, Murder'd by his ungodly Brother; because his Works were righteous and He accepted by God.</P>
<P><HI>Job's</HI> Bereavement was the most sudden and tragical that we ever read of: His <HI>ten Children</HI> feasting together, and rejoycing in one anothers Love; and on a sudden comes a fierce Wind from the Wilderness, &amp; blows down the House, and buries 'em all together in a moment of Time; crush'd to pieces in the mighty Ruines of some princely Fabrick.</P>
<P><HI>Jacob</HI>'s Bereavement in the Sudden Death of <HI>Rachel</HI> was very awful to him; as indeed all Deaths in <HI>Child-birth</HI> are, because of the joyful
<PB N="5" REF="003888_0016_1003182AA54916F8"/>
Hope therein frustrated of a new &amp; double Life. We have not the like scarce, but in the dying of the Wife of <HI>Phineas.</HI> Read the moving, killing Stories: Gen. xxxv. 16,—20. <HI>Rachel travailed and she had hard Labour, and the Midwife said to her, Fear not, thou shalt have this Son also: And as her Soul was in departing She called his Name Benoni:</HI> The Son of my sorrow! <HI>And Jacob set a Pillar upon her Grave; it is the Pillar of Rachel's Grave unto this Day.</HI> But never was the holy and terrible Anger of God more testifi∣ed against a Family of Religion, than in the united Deaths of <HI>Eli,</HI> his <HI>Sons,</HI> and his pious <HI>Daughter-in-law</HI>: 1 Sam. iv. 19,—22. <HI>And when she heard that the Ark of God was taken, and that her Father-in-law &amp; her Husband were dead, She bowed her self and travailed: And about the Time of her Death, the Women said to her, Fear not, for thou hast born a Son! but she answered not, nor regarded it; only named the Child Ichabod, saying, The Glory is departed from Israel, for the Ark of God is taken.</HI></P>
<P>The fair <HI>Naomi</HI> had a very awful sense of the Divine Anger, when she return'd from the Land of <HI>Moab</HI> desolate and empty; having buried <HI>her two Sons and her Husband</HI>: Ruth i. 20. <HI>Call me not Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me, and testified against me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>David's</HI> Bereavement in the Death of his <HI>Child,</HI> was an express Testimony of the high Displeasure of God against him for his Sin. <HI>Nathan</HI> told him in way of Threatning and Punishment, <HI>The Child shall die.</HI> He fasted and wept therefore before the Lord. But the Death of <HI>Amnon</HI> for his Folly &amp; Incest, and the Death

<P>And yet these awful, sudden and grievous B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦reavements were <HI>no</HI> always from the Divin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Displeasure, however <HI>well</HI> the Bereaved did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> apprehend it, and fear &amp; mourn &amp; fall at God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> foot.

<P>And so it seems to have been in the Death▪ the <HI>Prophet</HI>'s <HI>Wife,</HI> when <HI>the Desire of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was taken away with a Stroke,</HI> and <HI>behold I do</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said <HI>the Lord</HI> to him, and forbad him to mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> or weep, Ezek. xxiv. 16.

<P>So the excellent Servants of God have be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>v'd, both before and since the days of <HI>Aaron,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der a like eminent Government of the Spirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ace. <HI>Job</HI> when he heard of the distastrous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d of his <HI>seven,</HI> his <HI>ten,</HI> his <HI>all,</HI> fell down and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orshipped, in a <HI>few</HI> Words.

<P><PB N="10" REF="003888_0021_10031805955E6DB0"/>Now such <HI>gracious Silence</HI> may exceedingly become us under our awful and sudden Bereave∣ments, because</P>
<P N="1">1. To be sure then <HI>there is nothing said against the will of God, and his Doing:</HI> Nothing in way of <HI>Complaint</HI> against God, as if he were a <HI>hard Master</HI>: Nothing in way of <HI>Anger</HI> and Displea∣sure, as <HI>Job</HI>'s Wife would have provoked his Spirit: Nothing in way of <HI>Murmur</HI> as the <HI>Is∣raelites</HI> of old <HI>spake against God.</HI> Far, far be from us, any <HI>Look</HI> or Appearance of Displicency at what God orders out to us or ours, and much less any <HI>Word</HI> from our Lips of that nature.— Yet <HI>David</HI> was displeased when God struck <HI>Uzza,</HI> and <HI>Jonah</HI> was angry when his Gourd was blasted. But <HI>Job</HI> sinned not, <HI>nor charged God foolishly.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This gracious Silence <HI>speaks much and aloud for God.</HI> It has its Voice and Language, and is easily heard and understood. <HI>There is no Speech nor Language where its Voice</HI> is not known.</P>
<P>It speaks <HI>Submission</HI> to the Sovereign Will of God: As a <HI>Son</HI> or <HI>Servant</HI> is silent under the Rebuke or Correction of a good <HI>Father</HI> or <HI>Master:</HI> Or as a <HI>Criminal</HI> is silent before his <HI>Judge</HI>; or as a Subject before his Prince when he has dis∣pleased Him.</P>
<P>We <HI>justify God in his Judgment</HI> when we hold our Peace. We own Him just and righteous, not having a Word to say. We humble our selves in his Sight, and accept of the Punishment of our Sin.</P>
<P><HI>Silence</HI> in a <HI>Sinner</HI> is expressive of <HI>Penitence,</HI> Sorrow and Shame and Fear. We take Shame

to our selves, and are afraid before God, and lay our Hand upon our Mouth. As <HI>Job</HI> did, Chap. xl. 3, 4. <HI>Behold I am vile, what shall I ans∣wer Thee? Ones have I spoken, but I will proceed no further.</HI> xlii. 6. <HI>Wherefore I abhor my self, and repent in Dust and Ashes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Silence</HI> before God under his afflicting Hand <HI>ascribes to Him all the Glories of his Sovereignty, Wisdom and Justice.</HI> It is mental Worship. The Mind thinks, considers and adores, while the Tongue is silent and the Lips move not. So de∣vout Souls mean it, and so God hears and ac∣cepts it. So <HI>Aaron</HI> glorified the Holy One <HI>of Israel</HI> in the Presence of many Worshippers. There had not been, it may be, on that Solemn Day, a like <HI>Act</HI> of Worship, as this Silence of <HI>Aaron.</HI> O what a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> did he make to God, while he held his Peace! A sacred Reverence stopt his Mouth! <HI>Mark me, and be astonied, and lay your Hand upon your Mouth.</HI> The whole Assem∣bly of Worshippers stood silent and adoring with him.</P>
<P N="3">3. This gracious <HI>Silence</HI> under sudden &amp; awful Bereavements highly becomes us <HI>in point of Pru∣dence and Care; Caution &amp; Guard upon our selves.</HI> Now keep the Door of thy Lips, fear to speak in a surprize, lest it be unadvisedly; which even the meek <HI>Moses</HI> himself did, and smarted for it; and was enjoyn'd Silence in his Suffering on that Account; <HI>"Speak no more to me</HI> (said God) <HI>of that matter.</HI></P>

his Holy Hand. Why shouldest thou speak suddenly, and then have cause to say, <HI>"It was an Error? Why should God be angry at thy Voice?</HI> Eccl. v. 2, 6.</P>
<P>Keep your Silence, said <HI>Moses</HI> to <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Eleazer</HI> in my Context, <HI>lest ye die.</HI> Gracious Si∣lence speaks a wise and reverend <HI>Fear</HI> of God, and a conscious <HI>Jealousy of our Selves.</HI> It shows a due Sense of our own Imperfection, Corrupti∣on and Sinfulness, that we dare not trust such a foolish Heart and Tongue. Our Affections are irregular, our Passions unruly; apt to break out at our Lips, when our Hearts are hot within us. We no sooner take fire within, but we blow up and burst to pieces. Out of the Abundance of the Affections the Mouth speaks; but Silence keeps them down from making Work for Repen∣tance. It was therefore wisely resolved by <HI>Da∣vid,</HI> Psal. xxxix 1, 2. <HI>I will take heed to my</HI> Heart, <HI>that I sin not with my Tongue; I will keep my Mouth with a Bridle while the Wicked is before me: I was dumb with Silence, I held my Peace.</HI> The Rein in the Mouth holds in the head-strong Passi∣ons, that would else run away with us. The Horse that has a hard Mouth, &amp; too much Spirit, needs a hard Kirb, and a strong Hand. More∣over. Silence in a Surprise gives Time and Room for <HI>Thought,</HI> while he that speaks suddenly speaks without thinking; and when he thinks over what he has said is ready to bite his Tongue, &amp; wishes he could eat his Words. And well may he be ready to gnaw his Tongue, who speaks hastily and foolishly of God or to Him. Therefore get alone, and keep Silence, and put thy Mouth in the Dust, when God rebukes and afflicts. The
<PB N="13" REF="003888_0024_100318334DA61C30"/>
<HI>Prudence</HI> of the thing, as well as the <HI>Religion</HI> of it, so directs. And indeed Religion is evermore the highest <HI>Wisdom.</HI> But after all that has been said in Praise of gracious <HI>Silence</HI> before God, it must be added,</P>
<P N="4">4. That <HI>wise and gracious Speaking,</HI> to God and of Him, in the Day of our Affliction, may be sometimes <HI>better than Silence</HI>; more to the Glory of God, the Edification of Men, and our own Ease and Comfort. Let but <HI>Grace</HI> govern the Heart and the Tongue, and whether we speak or hold our Peace, there will be the same Ado∣ration of God, Humiliation before Him, Sub∣mission to Him, and Prudence with respect to our Selves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tongue</HI> was made to speak, as well in the Day of Grief as in the Day of Gladness; and in both to the Glory of God. <HI>Moses</HI> spake admira∣bly to the Honour of God, while <HI>Aaron</HI> stood silent. <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Silence kept Time and Concert with <HI>Moses</HI> Words. There was perfect Harmony in both together.</P>
<P><HI>Job</HI> in his Bereavement spake, — O how <HI>well</HI> at first! but afterward there was much amiss. It had been better to have kept <HI>Silent</HI> still, than to open his Mouth and <HI>curse</HI> his Day as he did. Yet in his after Speeches he showed a better Judgment, and as good Affections, as his pious Friends. God saw him right in his Principle, Aim and End. He and they meant fervently to honour Providence, but <HI>Satan</HI> tempted and at times irritated them all: so poor are we at our best Estate, and in our best Exercises compassed with Infirmity.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="003888_0025_10030585EEFE0780"/>We must make the best of what is spoken, and piously meant in the Day of Sorrow. If the good <HI>Woman</HI> spake too passionately to <HI>Elijah</HI> on the Death of her Son, yet she spake penitently, and the Passion was overlooked. Did <HI>Elijah</HI> remem∣ber against her her Sins? or did he slay her Son? No; but she remembred her own Sins before God, and all was well. God considered that she was <HI>a Mother.</HI></P>
<P>I might give some <HI>Directions</HI> here, and say</P>
<P N="1">1. Under the surprising &amp; awful Providences of God <HI>let our Words be few.</HI> God is in Heaven and we on Earth. We are dust and ashes before the most High God.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let our <HI>Words</HI> be <HI>deliberate</HI> &amp; well weighed, Think awfully and speak slowly, for it is before the Lord; to Him and of Him. <HI>Teach me what I shall speak,</HI> and how!</P>
<P N="3">3. Speak <HI>humbly,</HI> abasing our selves in the Sight of <HI>God.</HI> As <HI>Job</HI> answered the Lord and said, <HI>Behold I am vile, what shall I answer thee? I will lay my Hand upon my Mouth.</HI> The holy <HI>Son of God</HI> himself <HI>fell upon his Face and prayed,</HI> in the Hour of his Sorrows.</P>
<P N="4">4. Speak <HI>adoring:</HI> fall down and <HI>worship:</HI> make Supplication, to thy Judge. <HI>What shall I say, He hath both spoken to me, and Himself hath done it.</HI></P>

<P N="6">6. We must speak our <HI>Trust in the Grace and Mercy of God thro' the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> No Words of Despondency should fall from our Lips.

Displeasure &amp; Complaint at what God does; but we must <HI>open</HI> our Mouth to <HI>adore,</HI> confess, supplicate, bless and praise the wise, the holy, sovereign, good and faithful God. Our <HI>Sins</HI> may well stop our Mouth from complaining, but the <HI>Grace</HI> of <HI>God</HI> opens 'em in humble Con∣fessions and Supplications to him: And to speak also unto <HI>others</HI> for their Instruction, Admoni∣tion, Direction, Excitation, Consolation, spiri∣tual Edification and Establishment in Faith and Holiness. Such <HI>speaking</HI> is at any Time, and in every Case, <HI>better</HI> than Silence. And <HI>Silence,</HI> like <HI>Aaron</HI>'s in the Text, is then only <HI>great and good,</HI> when it speaks <HI>thus</HI> to the Eyes and Hearts of all about us.</P>
<P>But this for the <HI>first Doctrine,</HI> That there is a <HI>gracious Silence</HI> which may highly become us in our sorrowful Bereavements. I pass to the other <HI>Observation.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> That <HI>the Ministers of Christ</HI> are more espe∣cially obliged to be <HI>Instances</HI> and <HI>Examples</HI> of a wise, gracious and reverend Deportment under the bereaving Hand of God.</P>
<P><HI>Aaron</HI> was in my <HI>Text</HI> singled out for an <HI>Ex∣ample</HI> to the whole Congregation of <HI>Israel.</HI> We read how <HI>well</HI> he behav'd, and gave Glory to <HI>God.</HI> It highly became him to do so. God had set him over his House, and before his Worship∣pers. He was to go before 'em in bearing as well as doing. And we are bid to take him, a∣mong the <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Prophets, who have spoken in the Name of the Lord, for an Example of suf∣fering Affliction,</HI> and <HI>Patience</HI> Jam. v. 10.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="003888_0028_100305D485635948"/><HI>Aaron</HI> was both a Prophet and a Priest, the Mouth of <HI>God</HI> to <HI>Israel</HI> and their Mouth to <HI>God</HI>; and he could <HI>speak well,</HI> yet was now Silent. He was now <HI>in Waiting,</HI> ministring in his Place, in the Sanctuary, when he gave this Illustrious Example of profound Submission: And so he stands a teaching and commanding Pattern to <HI>the Ministers of God</HI> for ever, and to them espe∣cially. Every worshipping <HI>Israelite</HI> were to learn of him that awful Day, but the <HI>Priesthood</HI> and <HI>Levites,</HI> his own <HI>Family</HI> and <HI>Tribe,</HI> more than others.</P>
<P>I speak therefore more especially to <HI>my self,</HI> and to my <HI>dear Son,</HI> your honoured and beloved <HI>Pastor,</HI> this Day; to charge <HI>my self</HI> and <HI>him,</HI> in the Name and Presence of the <HI>Great and Holy God,</HI> who is pleas'd to lay his bereaving Hand upon <HI>us</HI>; that we fall down before Him and im∣plore his Grace to help us <HI>to carry Our selves be∣fore You</HI> with that Silence and Humiliation that shall honour his Holy Name before You, and exemplify in some manner <HI>those Doctrines and Commandments of God our Saviour,</HI> which we have been so often preaching to you in <HI>the Days of Death and Mourning</HI> that have passed over us.</P>
<P><HI>Ministers</HI> have their <HI>Trials,</HI> and very <HI>awful</HI> ones as well as others. They are <HI>Sinners</HI> as well as others, and their Sins are <HI>greater,</HI> more ag∣gravated and heinous then other Mens. And if they are like <HI>Aaron</HI> among the <HI>Saints</HI> of God, as by their special Consecration to Him they are peculiarly bound to be, they are the more <HI>likely</HI> to be exercised with Afflictions, for <HI>many are the
<PB N="18" REF="003888_0029_1003058E0019E4E8"/>
Afflictions of the Righteous</HI>; and they are the more <HI>meet</HI> to be so exercised, because they have Graces to exercise in this Way; according to what we read, Heb. x. 32. <HI>After ye were illumi∣nated ye endured a great Fight of Afflictions</HI> Un∣to <HI>such</HI> it is given on the behalf of Christ, not only to <HI>believe</HI> in Him but to <HI>suffer</HI> for his Name. <HI>Phil.</HI> i. 29. It is <HI>given</HI> to them to do so! <HI>Grace</HI> is given to them for this End, and it is a <HI>Favour</HI> done 'em, an <HI>honour</HI> put upon 'em, when by the help of Grace they bear and endure <HI>in an ex∣emplary manner</HI> the Afflictions and Sufferings which it pleases their <HI>Holy Saviour</HI> to call them to.</P>
<P><HI>Ministers</HI> are under the common Bonds of all <HI>Christians,</HI> together with the superadded Charge of God. 2 Tim. iv. 5. <HI>Watch thou in all things, en∣dure Afflictions, make full proof of thy Ministry.</HI> ii. 9. <HI>Thou therefore endure Hardness, as a good Soldier of Jesus Christ.</HI> We cannot fulfil the Ministry that we have received of the Lord Jesus, if we be not conformed to Him in suffer∣ing Affliction and Patience, as he calls us to it. This Commandment we have received from the Captain of our Salvation, who was made per∣fect thro' Sufferings.</P>
<P>Ministers bear <HI>Testimony</HI> and Witness to the Doctrine of the Cross, by bearing it themselves, after <HI>Christ</HI> and before the Flock. They honour Him and edify the Church while they do so. They follow Him and lead the Flock in his steps.

<P>Yea, We have sometimes gladly <HI>learned,</HI> and been edified by some of <HI>you</HI> in your Sorrows, while we have been ministring unto you; and shall always rejoice to be <HI>taught</HI> by your humble and gracious Example.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>People</HI> be together looking unto <HI>Jesus,</HI> the Author and Finisher of our Faith, who for the Joy before Him endured the Cross.

And He has said to his suffering Saints and Ministers, <HI>"My Grace is sufficient for you, for my Strength is made perfect in Weakness.</HI></P>

<P>God has been very gracious to me and mine in his <HI>sparing Mercy.</HI> For about <HI>Six and twenty Years</HI> there had been no Death in my Family, when God suddenly called for the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther</HI> from my Arms, and now at the End of <HI>three Years and a half</HI> the <HI>Daughter</HI> follows.

and godly Sorrowing to the Table of Christ,</HI> we shall be accepted. The Ordinance calls for it, and is given to assist us in it. There let us be mourning for <HI>Sin,</HI> mourning after Christ, Pardon, Peace, and Communion with Christ in the Be∣nefits of his Sufferings; and we shall find that the Lord hath anointed Him to give unto them that mourn in <HI>Zion,</HI> Beauty for Ashes, the Oyl of Joy for Mourning, and the Garments of Praise for the Spirit of Heaviness.</P>
<P>We must be bearing about in our Bodies the Dying of our Lord <HI>Jesus,</HI> that the Life of <HI>Jesus</HI> may be manifested in our mortal Flesh. He is the <HI>Example</HI> to us of holy Dying, and also the <HI>quickning Spirit</HI> for this blessed End.

<P>Is not the <HI>Lord's Table</HI> a <HI>Bond</HI> upon us to live as dying Men and Women? and also a <HI>Means</HI> appointed for this End unto Believers?

<P>Our <HI>Consolation</HI> in the Death of our <HI>godly Re∣latives</HI> is founded on the Dying and Resur∣rection of our Lord Jesus. <HI>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them that sleep in Jesus God will bring with Him.</HI> Therefore we cannot <HI>Sorrow as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se that have

<HEAD>David<HI>'s Words</HI> Upon the <HI>Death</HI> of his <HI>Child.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 SAMUEL XII. 23.</HI></BIBL>
<P>— I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THEY are <HI>David</HI>'s calm and quieting Words upon the <HI>Death</HI> of his Child. He had been in great <HI>Sorrows,</HI> the Sorrows of Nature and also of Grace; the Sorrows of deep Humiliation and Repentance under the holy Anger and Hand of God.</P>
<P><HI>Nathan</HI> the Prophet was sent by God to him to lay open before him his <HI>Sin,</HI> and to tell him that the <HI>Child</HI> should die. <HI>David</HI> humbled his Soul with Fasting, and lay all Night upon the Earth. The <HI>Elders</HI> of his House went to him to raise him up and constrain him to eat, but he would not be entreated by them. Therefore when the Child was <HI>dead</HI> they were afraid to let him know of it, lest his Sorrow (which was so great before) should quite overwhelm him. But to their Surprize he arose and washed himself, and went into the House of God &amp; worshipped;
<PB N="24" REF="003888_0035_1003056B1C0825C0"/>
and they set Bread before him and he did eat. His Servants humbly ask him the <HI>Reason</HI> of this his Conduct, and in the Meekness of Wisdom and Grace he <HI>answered</HI> &amp; satisfied 'em. <Q>While the Child was yet alive, said he, I fasted and wept; for I said, Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me, that the Child may live? But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? Can I bring him back again? <HI>I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Soul</HI> of the Child was <HI>gone</HI>: gone from the Body which was therefore to turn into Dust, and gone to the World of Spirits, to the Spirits of the Just, (as <HI>David</HI> hop'd) to the Bosom of <HI>Abraham</HI>; according to the Prayers he had been pouring out for it, with strong Crying and Tears.</P>
<P>He could not think of a <HI>Resurrection</HI> from the State of the Dead, his Prayers and Tears could not bring him back again; he could not expect or desire it. God's Will was done, and it be∣came him to submit; to make the best and get the Good of the Bereavement, to worship and behave agreably. He turn'd his Thoughts there∣fore to <HI>his own Dying,</HI> to get himself more ready for his own Departure; and if his Child were <HI>happy</HI> to meet it in a better Life. <HI>"I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</HI></P>
<P>The Words present us with the following <HI>use∣ful,</HI> but <HI>familiar</HI> and plain <HI>Observations.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That our <HI>Dead are gone</HI> from Us and this World of ours, <HI>no more to return</HI> to Us or it till the last Day.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="25" REF="003888_0036_100305DBADA2A9B8"/>2. That <HI>we are all going</HI> after 'em to the o∣ther World.</P>
<P N="3">3. That we should <HI>seriously remember this</HI> in the Days of our <HI>Bereavements,</HI> and in our Sorrows over our Dead.</P>
<P N="4">4. That <HI>Parents</HI> especially should think aw∣fully of it, in their Mourning for <HI>dead Children.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> The <HI>Dead are gone</HI> from this World of ours, no <HI>more to return</HI> to it till the last Day. The <HI>Spirit</HI> leaves the mortal Body, its earthly House and Tabernacle; and goes to the World of <HI>Spirits,</HI> the invisible World, into an eternal and unchangeable State. For there is an unseen <HI>fu∣ture World</HI> whither the Soul goes at Death; and there is a <HI>twofold State</HI> in that World of Spirits; a State of <HI>Happiness</HI> for elect &amp; sanctified Souls, and a Place of <HI>Misery</HI> and Torment for unholy and unclean Spirits.</P>
<P>For when <HI>the Dust returns to the Earth as it was, the Spirit</HI> returns <HI>to God that gave it.</HI> Eccl. xii. 7. And its everlasting State is then decided and fixed by Him, in a most righteous Judg∣ment passed immediately upon every one: Some <HI>go away into everlasting Punishment, but the Righ∣teous into Life Eternal.</HI> Mat. xxv. ult.</P>
<P>There are <HI>the Spirits in Prison,</HI> i. e. Hell. 1 Pet. iii. 19. And <HI>broad is the Way, and wide the Gate, that leadeth to Destruction, and many there be which go in thereat,</HI> Mat. vii. 13. A whole <HI>World</HI> of precious Souls once went down <HI>together,</HI> into that <HI>Abyss</HI> of Misery, <HI>Eight</HI> only excepted. They went <HI>quick</HI> into Hell. The <HI>Depths</HI> cover'd
<PB N="26" REF="003888_0037_1003181442BD0CC0"/>
'em, they sank to the <HI>Bottom</HI> as a Stone. In what <HI>Sholes</HI> did they sink! as <HI>Fishes taken</HI> in the wide <HI>Net</HI> of God! how did the <HI>proud Waters</HI> go over their Souls! and the <HI>Floods</HI> overwhelm them! for <HI>Violence</HI> was in their Dwellings. — And what Multitudes from Age to Age have since gone <HI>to the Generation of their Fathers, never to see Light!</HI> Psal. xlix. ult. <HI>Tophet</HI> is large eno' to receive them all, and the many more that are still fol∣lowing their pernicious Ways. We are told of <HI>one</HI> of these many, <HI>roaring in the place of Torments</HI> as soon as out of the Body, and begging that <HI>his five surviving Brethren might be warned</HI> and prevented from coming after him. Luk. xvi. 28.</P>
<P>But there is <HI>a Remnant according to the Electi∣on of Grace</HI> that are gone to <HI>Heaven</HI>; to Ever∣lasting Life, Blessedness and Glory; and a <HI>few</HI> more chosen of God, and called by his Grace, are going after Them. <HI>There</HI> are <HI>Abel, Seth, E∣noch,</HI> and the <HI>Antediluvian Patriarchs</HI>; there <HI>Noah, Abraham, Moses, Prophets</HI> and <HI>Apostles</HI>; and there <HI>the Spirits of all the Just, made perfect,</HI> Heb. xii. 23.</P>
<P>These <HI>happy Dead</HI> are enter'd into <HI>Life, are a∣live for evermore.</HI> In the Day they died they were taken up by <HI>Angels,</HI> and carried to the <HI>Paradise</HI> of <HI>God</HI>; They are there <HI>with Christ,</HI> where <HI>He</HI> is, <HI>to behold his Glory,</HI> and to <HI>come with Him</HI> at the Resurrection of the Just. And <HI>blessed and holy</HI> are all they that have Part there∣in! on Them the <HI>Second Death</HI> has no Power.</P>
<P>Thus the Dead <HI>are gone!</HI> and <HI>whither</HI> they go we know, &amp; the <HI>Way</HI> we know: Not as to <HI>Indivi∣duals,</HI> but considered <HI>Collectively as two vast Bodies</HI> of Godly &amp; ungodly, in their <HI>unchangeable</HI> State.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="003888_0038_100305F8919B9568"/>For they <HI>must return no more to us, in this World.</HI> "Can I bring him <HI>back</HI> again? or shall he <HI>re∣turn</HI> to me? says my <HI>Text.</HI> O no! not all the Prayers and Tears of the <HI>Living</HI>; nor all the Wishes &amp; Cries of the <HI>miserable Dead,</HI> can obtain a Return for any One of <HI>them:</HI> and as for the pious and <HI>happy Deceased,</HI> they would not return if they might.</P>
<P>This Account and <HI>Idea</HI> of Death should be fa∣miliar to us. Job x. 21. <HI>I go whence I shall not re∣turn.</HI> vii. 8, 9, 10 <HI>The Eye of him that has seen me shall see me no more,—he that goes down to the Grave shall come up no more; he shall return no more to his House, neither shall his Place known him any more.</HI> The dead are in a <HI>fixt</HI> State; they have bid a final <HI>Farewell</HI> to this World; so has the buried <HI>Body</HI> and so the departed <HI>Spirit</HI> till the Resurrection Day; then they will be again <HI>united,</HI> and share together in everlasting <HI>Sorrows</HI> or in everlasting <HI>Joys.</HI></P>
<P><HI>So Man lieth down and riseth not again till the Heavens be no more,</HI> Job xiv. 12. And then the dead shall rise only to be <HI>judged,</HI> every one <HI>ac∣cording to what</HI> he has been and done here <HI>in the Body, whether good or evil,</HI> 2 Cor. v. 10. How far is this from any Return to this animal and sensitive Life, to our present earthly Rela∣tions or worldly Possessions, or to any second Time of Probation, or further Opportunity for serving God and our Generation, and working out our own Salvation: the only worthy End and Work of our present Time and Life.</P>
<P>Upon all, An <HI>Existence</HI> somewhere, after we go hence, is supposed. <HI>Going</HI> and <HI>returning</HI> plainly imply this. We could not be said to <HI>go,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="003888_0039_1003059E4D69F1D8"/>
if our Spirits were not in some Place or other after this Life is ended; and much less could we speak properly of <HI>not returning,</HI> if we did not indeed exist any where.</P>
<P>Yet neither can it be inferred from such a <HI>mode</HI> of Speech, that the <HI>Body</HI> shall <HI>never</HI> return to Life again, or that the <HI>Soul</HI> shall <HI>never</HI> return into the Body: It only means that the depart∣ed <HI>Spirit</HI> returns not hither, that we know of, till the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of the Dead at the last Day. 'Till that Day the Body will not return from the Grave, nor the Spirit from <HI>Hades,</HI> the invisible World: But then there will be a <HI>Re-union</HI> of Soul and Body.— This was an Article of Faith before <HI>Job</HI>'s Time, and has continued to be so down to our Days: Job xix. 25. <HI>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at the latter Day upon the Earth; and tho' after my Skin worms destroy this Body, yet in my Flesh shall I see God: Whom I shall see for my Self and my Eyes shall behold, and not another: tho' my Reins be consumed within me.</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 42. <HI>For this Corruptible shall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal Immortality.</HI></P>
<P>In short, <HI>Going</HI> and <HI>not returning</HI> in our <HI>Text</HI> means, never to live again <HI>such a Life as this</HI> which we now do in the Body, either on bodily or spiritual Accounts: <HI>"He shall return no more to his H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use,</HI> as it is said in the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> to his present worldly Possessions or Enjoyments, Business or Delights: No, nor to the <HI>Worship</HI> here any more, as <HI>Hezekiah</HI> bemoaned himself under the Sentence of Death; <HI>"I shall not see the Lord, even the Lord in the Land of the Living; I shall beheld man no more with the Inhabitants of
<PB N="29" REF="003888_0040_100305E32FA203F8"/>
the World.</HI> He must take leave for ever of his <HI>Palace</HI> and <HI>Court,</HI> his princely State and Magni∣ficence; but what was more than all this, he must see the <HI>Temple of God</HI> and his Courts no more; no more be among his <HI>Worshippers,</HI> in whom was all his <HI>Delight,</HI> as the most <HI>excellent</HI> on Earth.</P>
<P>And this is at last the awful meaning of <HI>going</HI> at Death, to return <HI>no more,</HI> "I must enter in∣to <HI>a fixt and unchangeable State for Eternity,</HI> ne∣ver to enjoy <HI>another Time of Probation &amp; Trial.</HI> There is <HI>a great Gulf fixed</HI> betwixt this and the next World, as well as between the <HI>two infinite∣ly distant States</HI> in that to come. Luk. xvi. 26, 27. Neither did miserable <HI>Dives</HI> ask to come back <HI>himself</HI> into this World; he knew it could not be granted. And when he pray'd that <HI>Lazarus</HI> might be sent from his blissful Seat, upon the glorious Errand of converting his Brethren, a Work worthy of the highest Angel, the <HI>Answer</HI> is, "That there are <HI>living Ministers</HI> to preach the Gospel, and <HI>Saints departed</HI> have other Work.</P>
<P>The Sum of all is, Our present Life is the <HI>only</HI> Time and State of <HI>Probation</HI> to us; at Death we pass into the World of Reward or Punish∣ment, which is eternal &amp; unchangeable. This Life is the only <HI>Space granted us for Repentance,</HI> and for <HI>working out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</HI></P>
<P>This World is not our <HI>Home.</HI> We are all leaving it. <HI>Time</HI> is of infinite price to mortal Man, and the shorter his Time is, it is of so much the more Price. Every <HI>Moment</HI> of it should be carefully <HI>redeemed,</HI> in observing the <HI>Seasons</HI> of

particular Duties; to fill it up with Work and Spirit. Death, the <HI>Period</HI> of this Time, is a very awful and critical Moment. Let us see to it, that we all <HI>live</HI> as Those that are going hence, we know not how soon, never to return. And let it comfort the <HI>Godly,</HI> that they are going from, never again to return to, this State of Sin and Sorrow.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> As our Dead are gone, no more to return to us, so <HI>We are going after them to the Grave,</HI> and to <HI>the World of Spirits,</HI> to the State of everlast∣ing <HI>Happiness</HI> or everlasting <HI>Misery.</HI> This nearly concerns us, and should exceedingly affect us. Every one must say to himself, as <HI>David</HI> here, <HI>"I shall go</HI> also! I am going, I must go, must soon be gone! and we should be able to add, Thro' Grace I am preparing, getting ready for my Departure, and am willing to be gone! — This we may think to be the Sense of <HI>David</HI>'s Heart, the Spirit with which he spake.</P>
<P>Within a very, very little Time we shall all be gone! gone hence for evermore! every Man Woman and Child! every one in his Time and Order, which God has appointed. For <HI>is there not an appointed Time to Man upon Earth? are not his Days also like the Days of an Hireling? for now shall I sleep in the Dust, and thou shalt seek me in the Morning and I shall not be.</HI> Job vii. i. &amp; ult. Thus our <HI>Days are determined</HI> by God, <HI>the Number of our Months are with Him, He has ap∣pointed our Bounds which we cannot pass.</HI> xiv. 5. For we are <HI>Strangers</HI> with Him and <HI>Sojourners, as all our Fathers were,</HI> and after them <HI>we go hence and are no more,</HI> Psal. xxxix. ult.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="003888_0042_1003183C9FDD4D88"/><HI>We know that God will bring us to Death, and to the House appointed for all the Living.</HI> We as surely know it, as that others are dead and bu∣ried before us. <HI>Every Man is drawing after as there are innumerable before him.</HI> We might have gone before many whom we have seen buried. We are, it may be, a Wonder to our Selves, that we did not go first; How soon we shall follow is unknown to us. We <HI>know not the Day of our Death; we know neither the Day nor the Hour.</HI> This we know, and should be saying to our Selves, the Young as well as the Old, <HI>"I go the Way of all the Earth. It is appointed for all Men once to die. We see that wise Men die, also the Fool and brutish Person perish. And what Man is he that liveth and shall not see Death? Shall he deliver his Soul from the Hand of the Grave?</HI> Or who <HI>can by any Means redeem his Brother, or give to God a Ransom for him? that he should still live for ever and not see Corruption?</HI> Psal. xlix. 9, 10.</P>
<P>The Grave is one of the unsatisfied and insa∣tiable things that cries, <HI>Give, give!</HI> and never says it has enough. One Generation goes down into it after another, yet is it not full. After the Thousands that are buried to Day, it craves and has as many more to morrow. And if we wait a little longer it is <HI>our House,</HI> it is <HI>ready for us.</HI> Job xvii. 1.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Souls</HI> are also going to the same Places of Happiness or Misery that those before us are gone to. Souls are not <HI>mixt</HI> in the next World as they are in this: Here the Godly and the wicked dwell in the same House, eat at the same Table, sleep in the same Bed, worship together in one Family &amp; in one Assembly. But Death
<PB N="32" REF="003888_0043_10031819A9CB5740"/>
makes a perfect and total Separation of the one from the other. The <HI>Godly</HI> are gathered to <HI>their</HI> People, as the Soul of <HI>Jacob</HI> to the Spirit of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and as the Soul of <HI>Lazarus</HI> to his Bosom; but the wicked and <HI>ungodly</HI> go to the Generation of <HI>their Fathers,</HI> never to see Light. — <HI>David,</HI> in the full Persuasion of his Child's Salvation, said, <HI>"I shall go to him.</HI> Gracious <HI>Parents</HI> will see again their Elect Children in everlasting Life. And there all pious Relations will meet again with Joy, and embrace for Ever∣more: But others <HI>shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and be themselves shut out,</HI> Luk. xiii. 28.</P>
<P>Put then the <HI>Question,</HI> every one to himself, <HI>"To whom and whither am I going?</HI> Going we all are, and hasting out of Time into an awful Eternity; but to <HI>which State</HI> in the Eter∣nal World are <HI>we</HI> hastning? Whither <HI>others</HI> are gone is not so much our Business to enquire, but whither <HI>we</HI> our Selves are going is a most important and necessary Consideration: O the <HI>happy few</HI> that are daily thinking of this! and upon good Grounds can say to themselves, as in 2 Cor. v. init. <HI>For we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a Building of God, a House not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens: For in this we grone ear∣nestly, desiring to be clothed upon with our House which is from Heaven.— Now He that hath wro't us for this self-same thing is God, who also hath given to us the Earnest of the Spirit, Therefore we are always confident, knowing that while we are at Home in the Body we are absent from the Lord; (for we walk by Faith and not by Sight) We are
<PB N="33" REF="003888_0044_100305EA1E812888"/>
confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the Body and to be present with the Lord. Wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of Him.</HI></P>
<P>I come to the <HI>third</HI> Head,</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> We should seriously remember and consi∣der these things <HI>in the Days of our Bereavement,</HI> in our <HI>Mourning over our Dead.</HI> Then it was that <HI>David</HI> said, "I shall go to my Dead, it shall not return to me."</P>
<P>This is a moving Season, wherein to <HI>muse</HI> and let <HI>the Fire kindle,</HI> and then <HI>speak</HI> to our Selves and others of our own and their <HI>Dying.</HI> Yea, and to speak to God and say, as in the xxxix Psalm, <HI>Lord! make me to know my End and the Measure of my Days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am! Behold thou hast made my Days a hand-breadth, and my Age is nothing before Thee! Verily every Man at his best Estate is altogether Vanity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>David</HI> the King, the Prophet and the Saint is a good <HI>Teacher,</HI> a great <HI>Example</HI> to us. Let us learn of Him to turn our <HI>Eyes off</HI> from our Dead, <HI>upon</HI> our Selves; upon our own <HI>Souls,</HI> their State, and Frame; and to say, <Q><HI>My Soul,</HI> thou must soon go after thy Dead! in what Preparation art thou for a better World? in what Readiness to leave this? and where would be thy Lot if this Night thou were re∣quired hence?</Q></P>
<P>O that we were wise, that we understood this, that we were considering our latter End! This is God's <HI>Wish</HI> concerning us, and we cannot wish
<PB N="34" REF="003888_0045_1003181B2D7826E8"/>
our Selves better than this wise and understand∣ing Heart. Let us ask of God this Wisdom which we so greatly want, and which He is li∣beral to give. Psal. xc. 12. <HI>So teach us to num∣ber our Days, that we may apply our Hearts unto Wisdom.</HI> What an easy Numeration Table is this! So many of our few Days already past; but so many more at the utmost Bounds to come; and whether indeed one more of them remain∣ing to us, altogether uncertain.</P>
<P>One would think that <HI>Flesh and Blood</HI> should teach men all this: And if not the Tokens of Death within our Selves, yet the pale and gastly Face of it on our nearest Relations, Friends and Nei'bours. But neither Flesh and Sense, nor natural Affection &amp; Sorrow of Heart can make us to know our own End, and the Measure of our Days, how frail we are. God only can reach the Hearts of Sinners with an effectual saving Impression. Men <HI>see</HI> others go, and <HI>feel</HI> them∣selves going, and yet will not consider it. There is an Enmity and Aversion in mortal Man to the sober Consideration of Death, the realizing his own Death, &amp; the Consequents thereon. Death passes by us, and touches us, and we are a little mov'd for the present, but presently forget it again. Sin which has brought Death on us, has taken away the Understanding, the Power and Heart to make a just and deliberate Reflection on the matter.</P>
<P>This <HI>Wisdom</HI> cometh down from <HI>the Father of Light,</HI> and is one of his most perfect <HI>Gifts.</HI> We are naturally all Darkness &amp; Insensibility in our Way to the Grave, as well as when we are in it. We need Divine Teaching in this most plain
<PB N="35" REF="003888_0046_1003183F48142938"/>
and obvious matter, of which we are willingly ignorant. God must give us <HI>an Eye to see,</HI> and <HI>an Ear to hear,</HI> and <HI>a Heart to understand.</HI> The fault does not lie in the <HI>Head,</HI> but in the <HI>Heart.</HI> The Promise of God is, <HI>a new Heart will I give you.</HI> He gives it liberally to them that ask it. It is the Spirit &amp; Practice of his Saints to think daily and seriously of Death and Eternity, and to be often saying to Themselves and before the Lord, <Q><HI>O my Soul, thou</HI> art going after the Ge∣nerations before thee! Is there not an ap∣pointed Time <HI>to me</HI> as well as others? O re∣member that <HI>my Life</HI> is Wind! thine Eyes are upon me and I <HI>am not!</HI> for now <HI>shall I</HI> sleep in the Dust, and Thou shalt seek me in the Morning, and <HI>I shall not be!</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is proper <HI>Discourse</HI> of a Soul to it <HI>self,</HI> and to God, in this mortal Body, and through this passing World. So let it <HI>muse,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Heart <HI>grow hot,</HI> and out of the Abundance of it the Tongue <HI>speak, "Lord make me to know my end.</HI> Light &amp; Heat come thus together into the con∣sidering Heart, and the Sun of Righteousness a∣rises over it with vital Influences; gives spiritual Life and sustains it in this Way. So Bodily Death serves to spiritual and eternal Life under the Power of the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> The Flames of Devotion kindle, are blown up, and kept burn∣ing, by daily Meditation on Death &amp; Eternity. But as this ceases, so the other goes out.</P>
<P>It is in this Way, very much, that the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> works on Souls, and carries on his good Work in them. He works by Providences and Ordinances together to this End, and on this wise. He revives and renews his good Work
<PB N="36" REF="003888_0047_1003181E5B042EF8"/>
hereby. He sends <HI>Death</HI> into our Windows, Chambers and Bosoms on this Errand; and he is <HI>the Minister of God</HI> to us for Good, a Messen∣ger one of a thousand. <HI>David</HI> in our Text found <HI>Nathan</HI> &amp; Death alike to him in the Hand of God. It was good for him that his <HI>Child</HI> died. (And in all Probability it had been ill for all <HI>Israel</HI> had it lived.) Death rung a Peal in his Ears, and he answered, <HI>"Lord I am coming!</HI> And as often as any die in our Families, this is the Lord's <HI>Voice</HI> to us, <Q>Man, Woman, Child, thou also art following! in what Readiness art thou?</Q> Who is the <HI>Man of Wisdom</HI> that hears and an∣swers to this Voice of God? This makes it good to go unto the House of Mourning, there to consider of the End of all Men, and lay the matter to Heart.</P>
<P>This is the Will of God <HI>in Christ Jesus</HI> con∣cerning us, for <HI>He</HI> has given us the Example. He kept his own Hour in Mind, and quickned Himself, <HI>"I must work the Work of Him that sent Me, while it is Day, the Night cometh.</HI> He retired upon the Death of his Friend the <HI>Baptist,</HI> and he wept and groan'd in Spirit at the Grave of <HI>Lazarus</HI>; for He was presently to die Him∣self, and how was He straitned till it was ac∣complished?</P>
<P>How great then is the Irreligion of <HI>Christians,</HI> and the Madness of mortal Men, in their Incon∣sideration of their own frail and dying State! Eccl. ix. 10. <HI>Man knoweth not his Time; but as the Fishes are taken in an evil Net, and as the Birds are caught in the Snare, so are the Sons of Men snared in an evil Time, when it cometh sud∣denly upon them.</HI> As if we were not made wiser
<PB N="37" REF="003888_0048_1003184435F7CFA8"/>
than the <HI>Birds,</HI> or were made as stupid and in∣sensible as the very <HI>Fish!</HI></P>
<P>This Imprudence and Improvidence of the Children of Men is very provoking to God, and great <HI>Sin</HI> in them; being in Contempt of the <HI>Reason</HI> which <HI>God</HI> has given them, of the <HI>Souls</HI> that He has made them, and of his <HI>Word</HI> which He has written for them, and of all that is there∣in said to 'em of a future State and of the <HI>E∣ternal Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> therefore interprets this sense∣less fearless Life to mean nothing less than those Words of profane Licence, which are so severely animadverted on &amp; exposed in Scripture, <HI>"Let us eat and drink for to Morrow we die! And to Morrow shall be as this Day and much more abun∣dant! Soul, thou hast Goods laid up for many Years, Eat Drink and be Merry.</HI> What is this but <HI>the God of this World</HI> blinding, stupifying and hard∣ning Men to their own Destruction! They blow out the <HI>Candle of the Lord</HI> within them, and quench the <HI>Spirit of the Lord</HI> in his Convictions. Let him smite and wound us we do but half a∣wake, and presently fall asleep again. Let Him lead us again and again to the Grave after our Friends, we go home and forget where we have been, what manner of Men, what corruptible Flesh we are, and that we our selves may be next carried out and buried.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Relatives</HI> in their Sorrows over their Dead judge themselves by what has been said, and be thereby directed and quickned. Let us at least make <HI>this Improvement</HI> of the Dispensation, <Q>I shall go after! in what readiness am I? Where and how do I look to meet those who
<PB N="38" REF="003888_0049_100305F05DE292E0"/>
are gone before me! or those that are to follow after me.</Q></P>
<P>But as my <HI>Text</HI> came from the Lips of a <HI>pious Parent</HI> in his Mourning, so I am led in a peculiar Manner to direct the present Truth to <HI>Them</HI>: Yet not to them only, but to <HI>Children</HI> also in the Death of Parents, and so in every <HI>other</HI> Relation. I go on therefore to say,</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV. Parents</HI> especially should think of this in their <HI>Bereavements,</HI> and in their Sorrows over their <HI>dead Children.</HI> The Words of <HI>David</HI> be∣long first to Them, <HI>"I shall go to it.</HI></P>
<P>The Death of <HI>Children</HI> is the most common Case in the whole Course of <HI>Death.</HI> Parents often live to bury many Children, and some∣times all. They that live long in this World, as the Excellent <HI>Judge Hale</HI> said on the Death of a Son, must look for this Grief. And the Grief is usually great in this Case, for Natural Affection is like Water, flowing downward. The Love of Parents runs down in a Torrent, the Love of Children returns as in an Eddy, which is also caus'd by the Stream. When the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> would represent the most bitter Grief, He represents it by a <HI>Mourning for an Only Son, and for a first-born.</HI> Zech. xii. 10.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> Mourning was of Parents for their Son. <HI>Abel</HI>'s Death was a bitter Grief to our first Parents. It called for Tears of Blood, and was as a Sword in the Bowels of <HI>Eve.</HI></P>
<P>When God would prove <HI>Abraham</HI> it was in this most tender point. <HI>"Take now thy Son, thy only one, whom thou lovest, and offer him to me.</HI> The God of <HI>Abraham</HI> knew what of all earthly
<PB N="39" REF="003888_0050_10031845CC80C288"/>
things lay nearest to his Heart, and was the ut∣most Test of his Love.</P>
<P><HI>Jacob</HI> was able to see his beloved <HI>Rachel</HI> die, and when he had set a <HI>Pillar</HI> on her Grave <HI>he journeyed on.</HI> Gen. xxxv. 20, 21. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>No <HI>Author</HI> ever drew <HI>Nature</HI> naked and to the Life like <HI>Moses.</HI> And no wonder; for he wrote under the In∣spiration of the God of Nature, to whom all things are naked and open. He the <HI>Father of Souls</HI> and Former of the Spirit of Man within him, knows his own Work, the <HI>Soul</HI> that He ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made, the hidden Springs and secret Movements of a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>thers</HI> Loves and Joys and Griefs; which are like the <HI>Flowings</HI> of the great Deep. <HI>Job</HI> xxxviii. 9, 10. Nor is there any part of sacred Story that delineates these, like that of <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Joseph,</HI> inimitably tender and mov∣ing. How is the Heart of a <HI>Father</HI> here painted beyond the Life, to a humane Eye, pierced, bleeding bursting, on supposed repeated Bereavements, in the Loss of <HI>three Sons</HI>? Genesis xlii. 36, 37, 38. <HI>And Jacob their Father said to them, Me have ye bereaved of my Children; Joseph is not, and Simeon is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot, and ye will take Benjamin away: All these things are against me. And Reuben spake unto his Father saying, stay my two Sons if I bring him not to thee; deliver him into my Hand, and I will bring him to thee again. And he said, My Son shall not go down with you, for his Brother is dead, and he is left alone; if Mischief befal him by the Way in which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave.</HI> Chap. xliii. 6, 11, 13. <HI>And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the Man whether ye had yet a Brother</HI>?— But <HI>if it must be so now,— Take your Brother and arise, go again to the Man; and God Almighty give you Mercy before him, that he may send away your other Brother and Benjamin! If I am bereaved of my Children, I am bereaved.</HI> — What a <HI>giving up</HI> of Nature was here! like his after <HI>gathering up his feet</HI> into the bed! So the dying Body af∣ter a vain Struggle resigns, and gives up the <HI>Ghost.</HI> And if hid God had that Day required the <HI>Patriarch's</HI> Spirit and his Breath, the Summons had been much more readily o∣beyed, than this Surrender of his <HI>Benjamin</HI> to the Will of the <HI>Man</HI> who had so strangely demanded a Sight of Him. But he had <HI>Simeon</HI> in Bonds, and the <HI>Life</HI> of all the rest of his Sons and their Children depended on his Sub∣mission; the <HI>Famine was sore upon</HI> them all, and this con∣strained him to let the other and only remaining Part of his <HI>Rachel</HI> go.</P><P>No doubt but it was a <HI>Spectacle</HI> highly pleasing to <HI>An∣gels,</HI> as it is unto <HI>Men</HI> for evermore; but how much more unto the <HI>Father Almighty</HI> Himself, to behold the <HI>dear Parent</HI> in his feeble Age wrestling and agonishing in Prayer for Divine Direction, and then in Faith committing his <HI>Only One</HI> to the tender Care and strong Protection of Al∣wise and Sovereign Providence, even as <HI>Abraham</HI> had done <HI>Isaac</HI> long before.</P><P><HI>Judah</HI> had with the utmost Emotion of Soul observed all these things, and laid 'em up in his Heart; and as he had in a <HI>Strain</HI> of filial Tenderness which merited the Birth∣right and carried it from <HI>Reuben,</HI> pleaded with his <HI>Father</HI> and prevailed: So when he stood again before <HI>the Man</HI> and saw <HI>Benjamin</HI> arrested by his Order and in Custody, he was able to set <HI>the Soul of his Father</HI> in such a Light before <HI>Joseph,</HI> as overwhelmed his Constancy, and broke up all the <HI>Springs of Nature,</HI> which he had <HI>damm'd</HI> up with the greatest Art and Resolution, as <HI>Bars and Doors to the great Deep.</HI> See Gen. xliv. 18,—34.</P><P>Forgive a <HI>Father</HI> in the Depth of Sorrow, that he has tried <HI>to soothe his Grief</HI> in this Excursion on the <HI>Parental Ten∣derness</HI> of <HI>Jacob</HI> in the Day of his Bereavements.</P></NOTE> But when he
<PB N="40" REF="003888_0051_100305F70DBEEFA8"/>
tho't <HI>Joseph,</HI> the Son he had by her, torn from him by Death, how did he take on? Chap. xxxvii 33, 34, 35. <HI>It is my Son's Coat; an evil Beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in Pieces! And Jacob rent his Cloaths, and put sack∣cloth upon his loyns, and mourned for his Son many Days. And all his Sons, and all his Daughters rose up to comfort him; but be refused to be com∣forted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave after my Son, mourning: thus his Father wept for him.</HI> This was but a <HI>supposed</HI> Death, yet <HI>real</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="003888_0052_10031847526CA108"/>
to the tender Parent, undoubted and certain to him, and mourn'd accordingly.</P>
<P>In like manner the mighty Reverence and Strength of <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Grace was tried, as with <HI>Fire,</HI> in the Sight of all <HI>Israel,</HI> and <HI>he held his Peace.</HI> His profound <HI>Silence</HI> spake aloud his profound <HI>Grief.— Job</HI> had been long before tri∣ed in more awful manner than this of <HI>Aaron</HI>; and he stands a prior Instance of <HI>Parental</HI> Ten∣derness &amp; Constancy. No one had more Plea∣sure and Joy in a numerous Issue, none ever be∣hav'd more piously toward a pious Progeny, and never did Brethren and Sisters live more in <HI>mu∣tual Love</HI> and Delight than they; yet when he was <HI>surpriz'd</HI> with the heavy Tydings of their Sudden and tragical Death together in their eld∣est Brother's House, he prostrated himself on the Ground and <HI>worshipped; "Naked came I out of my Mothers Womb, and naked shall I return</HI> (into the Grave, the common Womb and Repository of the Dead) the <HI>Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the Name of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>My <HI>Text</HI> relates how <HI>David</HI> behav'd on the Death of his <HI>Child,</HI> but on <HI>more bitter</HI> Occasions of Grief he <HI>lost</HI> himself, when he should rather have kept the Possession of his Soul, and call'd in the Exercise of Reason and Grace: I mean more especially on the Death of <HI>Absalom</HI>; unto Whom he could not wish to have his Soul ga∣thered; tho' he wished to have died for him, if he might have lived to repent.</P>
<P>The Love of <HI>Mothers</HI> is yet more tender. We read of <HI>two</HI> under a like Bereavement, but not in a like Passion of Grief; the Widow of <HI>Zidon</HI> and the <HI>Shunamite</HI>: When the one saw her <HI>Son</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="003888_0053_1003184BE340F2B8"/>
dead she burst out, <HI>"O thou Man of God! art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hou come to call my Sins to Remembrance, and to slay my Son?</HI> But when the Son of the other died in her Arms, she silently laid him on her Bed, and in her bitterness fell at the Prophet's feet.</P>
<P>The <HI>Parent</HI> we should think will improve the Grief, behave and speak aright under it; speak unto <HI>God,</HI> to himself and his. He has Years, Experience and Wisdom; is a <HI>Father</HI> and has seen much of a dying World: And what is the Father's <HI>Lesson</HI> from his Child's Death, but <HI>this</HI> in my Text? This at least, this the least, <HI>"I shall go to it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then, Let <HI>Parents prepare to part</HI> with their Children. Look on them as <HI>dying</HI> Crea∣tures, and accordingly care for their <HI>Souls.</HI> Look not upon them as <HI>yours,</HI> but God's, who may call for them when he will, having only given them to you in Trust and Charge, to educate them for him, for his Service here, and for Bles∣sedness in Himself for ever. Teach 'em betimes to know God and themselves; that they have precious immortal Souls, and that God is the Fa∣ther, Lord and Judge of their Spirits; that they are made for another and far better Life, may very soon die, and must whenever God orders, who will surely bring them into Judgment.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let <HI>Children</HI> think of and prepare for their going hence <HI>before their Parents.</HI> They are by no means sure of out-living them, much less should they expect it. Did not <HI>Job</HI>'s Sons and Daughters all die before hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>? I mean his first <HI>Quiver full</HI> of them. So did <HI>Aaron</HI>'s two Sons
<PB N="43" REF="003888_0054_100305FC1D012BC0"/>
die in the Presence of their Father; And <HI>Nao∣mi</HI> buried her two Sons in the Land of <HI>Moab.</HI> Indeed Parents naturally <HI>desire</HI> that their Chil∣dren may out-live them; and good Parents may let their Children hear 'em <HI>ask</HI> it of God in their daily Family Prayers; that theirs (by his holy Will) may live to serve Him when they are gone. With Reverence &amp; great Submission Children may say <HI>Amen</HI> to such Prayers of their Parents; but they may not please themselves with the Expectation of surviving their loving and dear Parents; to come into their Estate, nor for any worse Ends. We read of One who wickedly expected to out-live his Father and said, <HI>The Days of Mourning for my Father are at Hand, and then I will kill my Brother.</HI> But pious Children, from the Day of <HI>Abel</HI>'s Death, think of dying before their Parents.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let <HI>bereaved Parents be greatly quickned in their Preparations for their own Death.</HI> It is a sorrowful Case <HI>to need this Way</HI> of learning, by <HI>such</HI> a Providence. We should prepare for Death before we come to be Parents. Yet we need to learn it more and more, better and better, as long as we live. <HI>Live and Learn,</HI> learn to die as long as you live, and by all the Sorrows and Changes of Life especially. Learn betimes, learn in <HI>due Season,</HI> and yet learn in <HI>Age, out of due Time,</HI> if you have not learn'd before. Learn <HI>this</HI> Lesson over and over again, get it well by Heart, rivet it in your Memory, speak of it to your latest Breath, and practice it in your dying Moments.</P>

Thus did <HI>David</HI> in the Text. He had done well to have had his own Death as much in Mind, and in a like manner, when he heard of <HI>Absalom</HI>'s; tho' indeed he could not without <HI>horror</HI> have tho't of <HI>going to him.</HI> Happy the Father and Mother, the Son or Daughter, that can look forward <HI>to their own Death,</HI> and quiet themselves in the Day of their Bereave∣ment. O what need is there to be in a State of <HI>Grace and Peace with God</HI> for this End! and to have a well grounded Hope of such a State! of an Interest in Christ and a better Life.— A Pa∣rent should look on himself as so much <HI>nearer</HI> to Death than his Child, and should be able to hope, thro' Grace, that he is so much higher to a <HI>better</HI> Life, that he should <HI>feel</HI> the strong At∣traction and <HI>Powers of the World to come.</HI>— As the most pious and venerable Mr. <HI>Richard Bax∣ter,</HI> after his Advance in Life and Grace, and a sufficient Experience of the Vanity &amp; Emptiness, the Afflictions and Sorrows of this World, wrote under his <HI>Picture</HI> two of the <HI>best</HI> Lines that were ever written,
<Q><L>"Farewell vain <HI>World!</HI> as thou hast been to me,</L>
<L><HI>"Dust</HI> and a <HI>Shadow,</HI> these I leave with thee.</L></Q></P>
<P N="5">5. Let those <HI>who have no Children,</HI> no Name and Posterity of their Bodies, to leave behind them, live so much the more mindful of and de∣voted to a better World, that is an <HI>Heavenly. Absalom</HI> for this Cause erected himself a <HI>Pillar</HI> upon Earth; but what an End did he come to?
<PB N="45" REF="003888_0056_100306042240C0C8"/>
View him <HI>hung</HI> by his Pride, his <HI>flowing Locks,</HI> in the <HI>Oak,</HI> and there bleeding to Death for his un∣natural Rebellion against his Father &amp; his King; (his too indulgent Parent, who would have gladly <HI>died for him)</HI> and then look upon <HI>his Pillar,</HI> the Monument &amp; Memorial of his Crime and Shame. Like the <HI>Wretch</HI> that burnt the Temple at <HI>Ephesus</HI> to make himself remembred for an execrable <HI>Villain.</HI> But there is an <HI>Ever∣lasting Name,</HI> a Name <HI>written in Heaven,</HI> pro∣vided for and proposed to those Humble and Holy Souls in the Church of God, who neither have nor crave a Name (to leave behind 'em) upon Earth. Isai. lvi. 3, 4, 5. <HI>Neither let the Eunuch say, Behold I am a dry Tree! For thus saith the Lord unto the Eunuchs that keep my Sab∣baths, and choose the Things that please me, and take hold of my Covenant; even unto Them will I give in my House and within my Walls, a Place and a Name better than of Sons and Daughters; I will give them an Everlasting Name, that shall not be cut off.</HI> They that leave behind them here a Number of pleasant Children, leave but a <HI>dying Name</HI> in them which must soon be cut off; but a Name among <HI>the Sons and Daughters of the Lord Almighty</HI> is <HI>to Everlasting,</HI> in the Presence, Glory, Vision, Love, and high Enjoyment of the <HI>living God</HI> to all Eternity. God himself has rais'd a <HI>Pillar</HI> for his <HI>Elect</HI> in all Ages, &amp; writ∣ten their <HI>Names</HI> on it, to be read by <HI>Angels</HI> for ever and ever: Rev. iii. 12. <HI>Him that overcom∣eth will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and he shall go no more out; and I will write upon him the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God, which is New Jerusalem, which cometh
<PB N="46" REF="003888_0057_1003184ECECF59F0"/>
down out of Heaven from my God; and I will write upon him my New Name.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Let us <HI>all</HI> be exhorted and taught of God, to <HI>live always mindful</HI> that we and ours must <HI>shortly take leave,</HI> a final everlasting leave of this World and all things in it. We are all <HI>going,</HI> as fast as we well can, fast to our own surprises from Year to Year, one after another, <HI>out</HI> of a vain World, <HI>into</HI> an awful Eternity! Lord! that we could live and act, from day to day, under this View! What manner of Persons should we then be, and ought we therefore to be, <HI>in all holy Conversation and Godliness!</HI> in all Sobriety, Righteousness, Purity, Devotion, Hea∣venliness. It would make us <HI>look, not at the Things that are seen, but at the Things which are not seen; for the Things which are seen are tem∣poral, but the Things which are not seen are Eter∣nal.</HI> 2 Cor. iv. ult. One effectual Conviction of the <HI>temporary</HI> Nature of every thing under the Sun, abiding on us, would cure our inordinate and criminal Fondness for earthly Possessions, our unjust Cravings and Endeavours after them, as not <HI>worth</HI> a dying Creature's doing an <HI>unjust</HI> thing to gain, nor worth a <HI>wrangle</HI> about, to re∣cover (if wrong'd of) a due Portion in it. —<HI>We</HI> and our <HI>Families,</HI> we and our <HI>Children,</HI> are to∣gether hastning to the Grave, and it may be <HI>they</HI> before us; and <HI>what Portion have we under the Sun!</HI> Let the Words of the <HI>Apostle</HI> sink there∣fore into our <HI>Ears,</HI> and on every Occasion lie uppermost on our Hearts; 1 Cor. vii. 29, 30, 31. <HI>But this I say Brethren, the Time is short; It re∣maineth that both they that have Wives be as tho'
<PB N="47" REF="003888_0058_1003185058736258"/>
they had none, and they that weep as tho' they wept not, and they that rejoice as tho' they rejoiced not, and they that buy as tho' they possessed not; and they that use this World as not abusing it, for the Fashion of this World passeth away.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. And lastly, <HI>Pious Parents</HI> should even find a <HI>sacred Pleasure</HI> in thinking of <HI>going after and unto their pious Children deceased.</HI> They may fol∣low them to the Grave with the consolatory and peaceful Thought, which our <HI>Venerable Eliot</HI> spake out aloud as he went, after his dead <HI>Son, This is the Way to Heaven!</HI> As Grace &amp; Friend∣ship wro't in the Apostle <HI>John,</HI> and he suddenly answered on his hearing of the Death of <HI>Lazarus, "Let us go and die with him!</HI> So a like Transport of Love and Desire, may be forgiven to a <HI>gracious Parent</HI> on the Death of a Child, in whom he has seen the ruling Grace of God from early Infancy. <HI>Jacob</HI> did not behave like Him∣self, when he refused to be comforted on the supposed Death of such a Son as <HI>Joseph,</HI> saying, <HI>"No, but I will go down to the Grave after my Son mournin!</HI> It becomes <HI>the Seed of Jacob</HI> rather in the Days of Mourning over their pious Deceased, to take to themselves that other and better Transport of the Aged <HI>Patriarch,</HI> when he heard of <HI>Joseph</HI> yet alive, and next to the Throne in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and to say, <Q>The Soul of my Dead lives in the Presence of <HI>Christ,</HI> far above all Heavens, let me die and go to be with him there for evermore.</Q></P>
<P>It was in this Hope that <HI>Jacob</HI> gave Com∣mandment concerning his <HI>Bones,</HI> that his Sons
<PB N="48" REF="003888_0059_1003185306BA2B00"/>
should bury Him with his <HI>Fathers</HI>; and in the like Hope a believing <HI>Parent</HI> might desire to be laid with his <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<P>Surely it cast some Light into the <HI>first</HI> Grave that was ever dug, that <HI>Abel,</HI> the Darling of <HI>Heaven</HI> as well as of <HI>Adam,</HI> was the Person bu∣ried; and it may seem to the <HI>Godly</HI> thro' all Ages a kind of sanctifying and sweetning the Grave for ever. It is only and wholly the <HI>Grace of Christ</HI> in a Child before its Death, that can make it an <HI>Object of Desire</HI> after Death, in a religious Parent's Heart.</P>
<P>I hope I have in all your Hearts <HI>this Ground for Communion still with my dear deceased Child,</HI> in whom I think I saw the shining Grace of God before she came among you, and more since; tho' always under the Veil of great Modesty and Reserve. In the several Relations of a Child, a Wife, a Mother, a Sister, a Mistress, and a Friend, she has found Grace to carry her self in a laudable and exemplary manner. You are Witnesses that she has liv'd <HI>blameless and without Offence</HI> among you, and we who have known more of her secret Walk with God, and Watch over her self in her Retirements, have <HI>this for our Rejoicing, That in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fleshly Wisdom but by the Grace of God, she has had her Conversation in the World.</HI></P>
<P>You will give me leave therefore openly to utter my great Thankfulness to God, that He has pleas'd to Honour me before You in being the Father of such a Child; and if I have any <HI>Hope</HI> of the Grace of God in my own Soul, I
<PB N="49" REF="003888_0060_1003185970E9CA20"/>
must have a Measure of holy <HI>Joy</HI> in the Hope of <HI>going</HI> to her at my Decease, which can't be far off, and of <HI>coming</HI> with her in the Day of the Resurrection of the Just.</P>
<P>[The Sovereign <HI>God of our Spirits</HI> made her a pleasant <HI>Soul</HI> to her Parents from her <HI>Infancy. Thrice</HI> she received the Sentence of Death before she was <HI>Eighteen Months</HI> old, and it was a me∣lancholly Time with us by reason of her great Weakness, and the mortal Symptoms returning on her. It kept us the more in constant &amp; fer∣vent <HI>Supplications</HI> for her Life, and in daily <HI>Re∣signations</HI> of it; and her second and third Re∣coveries were as surprising to her <HI>Physicians,</HI> and unto others who saw her in her low Estate, as unto her near Relations. I have the <HI>Sermons</HI> of Wonder and Gratitude to God, yet lying by me which I preached on those Occasions, when all Hopes of Life had been once and again taken away. And I can never forget the dark &amp; fair Day, when the <HI>Beloved Physician</HI> having warn'd me that nothing now remained but to make the last Resignation of her into the Hands of her <HI>Saviour,</HI> I called my Family together for that End, and did it in the most solemn manner I was able, wherein I found my self greatly en∣larged, begging of God an <HI>easy Death</HI> by his holy Will: when on a sudden the Babes piercing <HI>shrieks</HI> ceas'd, for she lay in great Anguishes of pain, and <HI>the sleep of Death</HI> as we tho't came on and filled us with Tears of Joy to see her ex∣piring in Ease: but to our great Surprize we found it the next Morning to be the <HI>sleep of Life,</HI> for she wak'd free from every Sign of Danger,
<PB N="50" REF="003888_0061_1003060A0307A668"/>
her great Weakness excepted: She half opened one of her sunk Eyes, and answered unto the <HI>Barrow</HI> in the Street, repeating what was cry'd there to be Sold. When the dear and Reverend Mr. <HI>Pemberton</HI> saw this strange Recovery, and had express'd a kind of Astonishment at it, he turn'd to me and said, <Q>Well Mr. <HI>Colman,</HI> I am perswaded God purposes to make this <HI>Child</HI> a Blessing and remarkable in her Life.</Q></P>
<P>In the midst of this <HI>Bodily Weakness</HI> her <HI>Soul</HI> made uncommon Improvements for an Infant State; and it may be much <HI>the more</HI> for the weak State of the Body; for she had not Strength to run about and play like other Chil∣dren, which was then our Grief. We made it therefore our daily Pleasure, and her Diversion, to learn her <HI>Letters,</HI> and <HI>Prayers</HI> to God her Maker, Redeemer and Sanctifier, and to fill her little Mind with the Stories of all the <HI>Holy Men</HI> on Sacred Record; to strike her Admira∣tion and Affection with true <HI>Excellency</HI> and Per∣fection; for which End I took care to speak to her of every thing in a just and <HI>proper</HI> Manner, if possible to convey <HI>regular</HI> Ideas into her, as of the Greatness and Goodness of God, so of all that relates to his <HI>Worship</HI> and Service. By this Means before she could go alone she had suck'd in a <HI>little Treasure</HI> of Sacred Knowlege, and was nourished up from the Breast with the <HI>sincere Milk of the Word</HI>; the Knowlege whereof became the humble <HI>Pride</HI> of her Childhood, for we taught her to <HI>value</HI> her self on it, as far better than bodily Ornaments.]</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="003888_0062_1003185AF332E348"/>I early observ'd her daily Retirements <HI>to pray to her Father in Heaven,</HI> at five or six year old, or before; and tho't it my Duty to <HI>praise</HI> her for it, and examine her <HI>how</HI> and for <HI>what</HI> she prayed? and whether she kept to Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>'s excellent <HI>Form</HI> for Children? but her <HI>Answer</HI> greatly pleas'd as well as surpris'd me, "that she found God gave her Words to speak when she began to pray. I <HI>caution'd</HI> and <HI>directed</HI> her, and gladly left her to the best <HI>Teacher.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spirit of God</HI> was moving upon her often in her following Youth. The <HI>Families</HI> she some∣times visited in the Country took Notice of her serious and good Inclinations, her chaste Con∣versation coupled with Fear, her meek and quiet Spirit, Prudence and sober Cheerfulness, her Love of Lettess and Solitude.</P>
<P>Her Heart was always <HI>above the Things of this World</HI>; so far as I could perceive from first to last; and neither the <HI>Prospects</HI> of it elevated her, nor <HI>Injuries</HI> from it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oil'd or depress'd her. With a View to a better Life she dispos'd of her Self in <HI>Marriage,</HI> and has (I trust) found the Benefit of doing so to her infinite Gain. None was more content with her <HI>Lot,</HI> and no one happier in a tender <HI>Husband,</HI> or in the Love of her <HI>Nei'bours.</HI> There never was an Instance of more <HI>filial Piety,</HI> nor a Child more dearly beloved of Parents.—I might speak of her great <HI>Ingenuity,</HI> and how well she us'd her <HI>Pen</HI> as well as her <HI>Lips,</HI> both which drop'd as the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ney-comb</HI>; but her <HI>inward Adorning,</HI> of great Price in the Sight of God, was her <HI>Humiliation, Faith</HI> and <HI>Devotion</HI> before God, with <HI>Resignati∣ons</HI> to his blessed Will in all things; her <HI>Bene∣volence</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="003888_0063_100306145F6579C0"/>
to all, and special Love to <HI>the Godly in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>She early gave her Self up to God, but her <HI>timorous</HI> Disposition restrain'd her from proceed∣ing early to the <HI>Lord's Table</HI>; nor was it with∣out much Conflict of Soul and great Distress, thro' Fear of coming unworthily, that she at last came into full Communion. She afterward <HI>exceeded,</HI> to her <HI>own</HI> and her <HI>Consort</HI>'s great Dis∣comfort in her Preparations for Communion Days; which was her <HI>Infirmity,</HI> and I do not praise her for it. Good Christians should take more the Comforts of Religion in their Way to Heaven, in their Obedience to Christ, and in the Observation of his special <HI>Institutions.</HI> Isai. lxiv. 5. <HI>Thou meetest him that rejoyceth and work∣eth Righteousness, those that remember Thee in thy Ways.</HI></P>
<P>Her <HI>Sister</HI>'s Soul was, next to her own, her chief Care, and she even <HI>travail'd in Birth</HI> for her, to see <HI>Christ formed in her:</HI> She wrote to her, and spake to her for this End, living and dying, with the greatest Concern and Endear∣ment.</P>
<P>But yet more did her pious Soul travail and <HI>wrestle</HI> in Prayer <HI>for the Children of her own Bowels!</HI> Her many <HI>Papers</HI> on this Head, found since her Death, are a pregnant Proof hereof; how she prayed for them, dedicated and resigned them to God before they were born, as well as after it. — I can never forget the holy <HI>Fervours</HI> of Affections, and <HI>flowing</HI> Tears of Joy, with which she sent her <HI>first S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> to Baptism, and received him back from the House of God; and how I was instructed,
<PB N="53" REF="003888_0064_10030635C4BB9410"/>
charm'd and reproved by her Example, that pleasant Day! But yet more so <HI>Eleven</HI> Days after, when God called for the Babe away, to see her <HI>resign</HI> him with a Silence and Calmness, like that of the <HI>Shunamite</HI> of old, and almost without a <HI>Tear</HI>; for she had <HI>surrender'd</HI> and offer'd him up on the Day he was <HI>baptized.</HI></P>
<P>[Her dear <HI>Cousins</HI> tell me that when they sometimes <HI>visited</HI> her, and made some abode with her, she would in the <HI>Afternoons</HI> slip away from them, and at an hours End return with a Smile and tell 'em how pleas'd she had been to hear 'em so merry. Alas! had we apprehended how soon we were to see her no more, we had all seen her oftner, and it may be had but kept her from her better Retirements.</P>
<P>Her <HI>Afflictions</HI> were many for the short Time she liv'd, in her own bodily <HI>Sicknesses</HI> and in the <HI>Burial</HI> of her Children; but her greatest <HI>Sorrow</HI> was in the Death of her <HI>Mother</HI>; under all which she behav'd with admirable Submission and Devotion, and the most fervent <HI>Repentance</HI>; as it is written and required, Rev. iii. 19. <HI>As many as I love I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore and repent.</HI>]</P>
<P>But after all it must be said, That her Temper was exceeding <HI>timorous,</HI> and her Distemper <HI>Hysteric,</HI> the Accidents of which all know to be a <HI>Swimming</HI> of the Head and <HI>Inquietude</HI> of Mind. This naturally both <HI>clouded</HI> &amp; <HI>frighten'd</HI> her in her Sickness. She was then ready to En∣quire, <HI>"Why is it thus with me? If I have in Sincerity given up and resign'd my Self to God, as if I know my own Heart I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and now do it again, why then am I so afraid?</HI> Nor could
<PB N="54" REF="003888_0065_1003185C85600D88"/>
we more quiet and comfort her, than by laying before her <HI>the true and real Cause</HI> of it, from the <HI>Nature</HI> of her Illness. Nevertheless her Disor∣ders would return and her Fears with them; and she had eno' to do to wrestle with them, by en∣couraging her Self in God, and making her Re∣signations to Him, to the last Moments of her Understanding.</P>
<P>This short Account of <HI>Her,</HI> living and dying, is both <HI>consolatory</HI> to us, and also <HI>monitory</HI> and exciting, (and to <HI>Young People</HI> in particular) to be instant and earnest in caring for our Souls, and getting ready for a dying Hour.— What a <HI>Joy</HI> should it be to <HI>me</HI> this day, to be able to <HI>move you</HI> from the <HI>Example</HI> of one of <HI>my Chil∣dren?</HI> O might the pious <HI>Parents</HI> of this Flock, all of them, have the like and greater Consola∣tion in the Burial of their Adult Children, if God call 'em to such a Sorrow! May your <HI>Daughters</HI> be, all of them, more <HI>polished Stones</HI> in the Temple of our God! the Similitude of a <HI>Palace</HI> for the <HI>King of Glory</HI> to dwell in.</P>
<P>But I forbear. — My <HI>Text</HI> admonishes us to prepare <HI>to follow,</HI> both the <HI>Elder</HI> &amp; <HI>Younger,</HI> and her <HI>Father</HI> in particular. She will no more visit <HI>his house,</HI> nor he see her again in what was once <HI>her own</HI>; it is eno' that there are <HI>Mansions in the Father's House</HI> above, whether She is gone. She must no more be seen in these <HI>Places of the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly,</HI> this House of Prayer which she loved, nor keep another <HI>Sabbath</HI> with us on Earth; but there's a better Everlasting <HI>Sabbatism</HI> and Places of more <HI>Holiness,</HI> the <HI>Rest</HI> which remains to the People of God after this Life: And what signify

our <HI>Sabbaths, Sermons</HI> and <HI>Funerals,</HI> if we are not going thither!</P>
<P>Let our Souls therefore <HI>cleave to the Dead in Christ</HI>; by Faith in Whom, and living to Him, we come into that Union to all Saints which Death can never dissolve.</P>
<P>I now leave my <HI>dying Prayers and Blessing,</HI> with You the <HI>dear Flock</HI> of Christ in this Place; and with your honoured and Beloved <HI>Pastor,</HI> to whom God has made me doubly a <HI>Father.</HI> The Lord long continue Him to you, and increase your Joy in him, and his in you; and make You to each other a Crown of Rejoycing in the Day of Christ.</P>
<P>I <HI>thank</HI> you this Day for all the <HI>Love</HI> shown to <HI>my Child,</HI> while she was with You, and the <HI>Sorrow</HI> you express at her Death. She has liv'd desired, and died lamented by You.</P>
<P>I pray God to requite to the <HI>pious Sisters</HI> of the Flock, the tender Affection with which they have minister'd to the <HI>dear Deceased</HI> in her Sick∣nesses. May a merciful and faithful Saviour put these <HI>Kindnesses of God</HI> into that Roll of <HI>Charities</HI> which He will call over in the last most blessed Day; and say of them, <Q>I was sick and ye visited Me! for in as much as ye have done it to this least of Mine, ye did it unto Me.</Q></P>
<P>I leave a grateful Record of my particular Obligation to the pious and <HI>beloved Physician</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Tusts.</NOTE> of the Town, who to and even beyond his Power has always ministred <HI>gratis</HI> to the <HI>Pastor</HI> and his Family.

<P><PB N="56" REF="003888_0067_10031860DFF916D0"/>And now <HI>Brethren, "I commend You to God and to the Word of his Grace which is able to keep you, and to build you up unto the Inheritance of the Sanctified.</HI></P>
<P>When, or whether ever, we shall again see one anothers Faces in this Place is with God, and wholly uncertain to us; but absent in Bo∣dy, let us be together in Spirit: And pray for <HI>Me</HI> in my Age, "That the few Days yet re∣maining to me on Earth, I may find Grace to be still <HI>serving the Lord with all Humility of Mind, whatever Tears and Temptations may befall me</HI> thro' the Residue of my Pilgrimage! that <HI>none of these things may move me</HI> from, but indeed quicken and excite me in the Discharge of the Duties of that <HI>Ministry which I have received of the Lord, to testify the Gospel of the Grace of God.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Some <HI>MEMOIRS</HI> Of the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> of Mrs. <HI>Jane Turell,</HI> Who Deceas'd at <HI>Medford,</HI> March 26. 1735. <HI>Aetat.</HI> 27. Chiefly col∣lected from her own Manuscripts.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a Passage in <HI>Tully</HI> the <HI>Roman Orator</HI> to this purpose, "That if <HI>Virtue</HI> were incorporate, and to be seen with our bodily Eyes in a sub∣stantial Form, she would carry such Charms along with her as to ravish her Be∣holders; and command the Love and Admira∣tion of all that saw her.— Alike beautiful and engaging (and more so) should the holy Life and shining Example of the <HI>Christian</HI> be, to all that are blest with the Sight and Know∣lege of it; for herein we not only behold the godlike <HI>Image</HI> of it, but learn the <HI>Practicableness</HI> of the thing, and have our natural Ambition and Imitation mightily fir'd and excited.</P>

I now place before their Eyes the <HI>Picture</HI> of my <HI>Dear Deceased:</HI> The Lines and Lineaments, Colours and Shades laid and drawn by her own lovely Hand, guided by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Grace and Truth.</P>
<P>And I present it particularly and in the first Place to her dear &amp; only surviving <HI>Sister</HI>; and then to her nearest <HI>Relatives</HI> and Acquaintance, and to all the rising Daughters of <HI>New-England,</HI> that they may understand what true <HI>Beauty</HI> is, and what the brightest Ornaments of their Sex are, and seek them with their whole Desire; <HI>even the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in the sight of God of great Price. For Favour is deceitful, &amp; Beauty is vain: but a Woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.</HI>— And such an one (with some addi∣tional Excellencies and Accomplishments) was Mrs. <HI>Jane Turell</HI> born in <HI>Boston, New-England,</HI> Feb. 25. <HI>A. D.</HI> 1708. of Parents Honourable and Religious.</P>
<P>Her <HI>Father</HI> the Reverend Dr. <HI>Benjamin Colman</HI> (thro' the gracious Favour of <HI>God)</HI> is still living among us, one universally acknowleg'd to be even from his younger Times (at Home and A∣broad) a bright Ornament and Honour to his Country, and an Instrument in <HI>God</HI>'s Hand of bringing much Good to it.</P>

one. Her Constitution from her early Infancy was wonderful weak and tender, yet the Organs of her Body so form'd as not to obstruct the free Operations of the active and capacious Spirit within. The Buddings of Reason and Religion appear'd on her sooner than usual. — Before her <HI>second</HI> Year was compleated she could speak distinctly, knew her Letters, and could relate many Stories out of the Scriptures to the Satis∣faction and Pleasure of the most Judicious. I have heard that Governour <HI>Dudley,</HI> with other Wise and Polite <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> have plac'd her on a Table and setting round it own'd themselves diverted with her Stories. — Before she was <HI>four</HI> Years old (so strong and tenacious was her Me∣mory) she could say the greater Part of the <HI>Assembly's Catechism,</HI> many of the <HI>Psalms,</HI> some hundred Lines of the best <HI>Poetry,</HI> read distinctly, and make pertinent Remarks on many things she read.—</P>
<P>She grew in <HI>Knowlege</HI> (the most useful) day by day, and had the <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>God</HI> before her Eyes.</P>
<P>She <HI>pray'd</HI> to <HI>God</HI> sometimes by excellent <HI>Forms</HI> (recommended to her by her Father and suited to her Age &amp; Circumstances) and at other times <HI>ex corde,</HI> the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> helping her Infirmities. When her Father upon a Time enquir'd of her what Words she used in Prayer to God, she ans∣wer'd him,— <HI>"That when she was upon her Knees God gave her Expressions.</HI></P>
<P>Even at the Age of <HI>four, five,</HI> &amp; <HI>six</HI> she ask'd many astonishing <HI>Questions</HI> about divine Myste∣ries, and carefully laid up and hid the <HI>Answers</HI> she received to them, in her Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="003888_0072_10030633896B6C38"/>Throughout her Childhood she discover'd a very <HI>serious</HI> Spirit. Her Heart was tender, and her Conscience a well-inform'd faithful Guide, and Monitor.</P>
<P>The most that I am able to collect of her Life from <HI>six</HI> to <HI>ten</HI> is general (and from her) viz. That her <HI>Father</HI> daily instructed her, and inrich'd her Mind with the best Knowlege; and excited her to the due Performance of all Duty. And that her tender gracious <HI>Mother</HI> (who dy'd about four years before her) often pray'd for, and over her, and gave her the wisest Counsels, and most faithful Warnings; and that she was thank∣ful and grew in Knowlege and (she hoped) in Grace under them.— That she lov'd the <HI>School</HI> and the Exercises of it, and made a laudable Progress in the various Kinds of Learning proper to her Age and Sex.</P>
<P>At <HI>nine</HI> or <HI>ten</HI> (if not before) she was able to write; for in the Year 1718, I find a Letter of her honour'd Father's to her wrote in Answer to one of her's, Dated <HI>Brookline</HI>—Which he expresses himself well pleased with. A Copy of it follows.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have this Morning your Letter, which pleases me very well, and gives me hopes of many a pleasant Line from you in Time to come; it God spare you to me, and me to you.</P>
<P>I very much long to see your Mother, but doubt whether the Weather will permit me to Day. I pray God to bless you, and make you one of his Children. I charge you to pray

Take care of your Health, and as you love me do not eat green Apples. Drink sparingly of the Waters except the Day be warm. When I last saw you you were too shame-fac'd; Look People in the Face, speak freely and behave decently. I hope to bring <HI>Nabby</HI> in her <HI>Grand-Father</HI>'s Chariot to see you. The mean while I kiss your dear <HI>Mother,</HI> and commend her Health to the gracious Care of God, and you with her to his Grace.—Give my Service to Mr. <HI>A</HI>— and Family: also to Mr. <HI>S</HI>— and Madam; and be sure you never forget the Respect they have honoured you with.</P>

<P>In this her Eleventh Year I find an <HI>Hymn</HI> fairly written by her, dated <HI>January</HI> 4. 1718. Which I give you Verbatim.</P>
<Q><L>I Fear the Great <HI>Eternal One</HI> above,</L>
<L>The God of Grace the God of Love:</L>
<L>He to whom <HI>Seraphims</HI> Hallelujah's sing,</L>

<L>No Tho'ts but of his God inspire his Breast.</L>
<L>Happy are they that walk in Wisdom Ways,</L>
<L>That tread her Paths, and shine in all her Rays.</L></Q>
<P>Her <HI>Father</HI> was pleas'd to encourage her in this feeble <HI>Essay</HI> she made at Verse: He con∣descended to return her <HI>Rhymes</HI> like her own,

level to her present Capacity, with a special Aim to keep and fix her Mind on God and <HI>heavenly Things,</HI> with which she had begun. He therefore wrote and gave her the following Lines, which he permits me to insert.</P>
<Q><L><HI>JOY of my Life!</HI> is this thy lovely Voice?</L>
<L>Sing on, and a fond <HI>Father's</HI> Heart rejoyce.</L>
<L>'Twas nobly dar'd, my charming Child! a Song</L>
<L>From a <HI>Babes</HI> Mouth of right to <HI>Heaven</HI> belong.</L>
<L>Pleasant thy <HI>Wit,</HI> but more the sacred <HI>Theme,</HI></L>
<L>Such as thy <HI>Name</HI> and all my <HI>Cares</HI> beseem.</L>
<L>Already you repay the Pains I took</L>
<L>To form you for your <HI>Maker</HI> and your <HI>Book.</HI></L>
<L>Sing on my <HI>Bird</HI>! and let thy early Days</L>
<L>Be Sacred to thy God and to his Praise:</L>
<L>Thy Infant Wit devote to things Divine,</L>
<L>And like some beauteous Infant <HI>Angel</HI> shine.</L>
<L>But dost thou truly fear the <HI>Eternal One</HI>?</L>
<L>Be sure you do, for he is God alone.</L>
<L>And would you join with <HI>Angels</HI> in their Songs?</L>
<L>Thy earliest and thy best to Him belongs.</L>
<L>And dost thou count them <HI>blest</HI> that rest above,</L>
<L>In <HI>Jesus</HI> Presence, Image and his Love?</L>
<L>Now seek a Name among his Saints, and let</L>
<L>Thy Heart on heavenly Things be early set.</L>
<L>Then happy thou, <HI>my Child,</HI> in Wisdom's Ways</L>
<L>Shining in thy <HI>transfigur'd Saviour</HI>'s Rays.</L></Q>
<P>These Condescentions of her <HI>Father</HI> were no doubt of great Use to her, and had in some measure the Effect propos'd, to put her on think∣ing and writing more and better, and to gain more of his Esteem for Ingenuity and Piety, which she was wisely ambitious of; but above all to approve her Heart before God, <HI>her Hea∣venly Father who sees in secret.</HI></P>
<P>And accordingly she early began a sort of <HI>Diary</HI> without the knowlege of any one, where∣in in her <HI>fourteenth</HI> Year I find enter'd solemn

and pertinent <HI>Prayers</HI> to God to deliver her and the Town from the <HI>Small Pox</HI> then threatning it; or to prepare her and his People for the Vi∣sitation: Also a Meditation and Prayers occasi∣oned by the Death of a <HI>Friend,</HI> her Companion and Acquaintance<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mrs. <HI>Kilby.</HI></NOTE>, a few Months after of that <HI>Distemper</HI>; fill'd with such Sentences as these —</P>
<P>"Gracious and merciful <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Father,</HI> par∣don my Sins for <HI>Christ</HI>'s sake. Let my Soul be precious in thy sight. I fly to thee for Protecti∣on. Give me an entire Resignation to thy Will and Preparation for Death; and let me be found among thy Children at the Great Day.</P>
<P>"I this Day follow'd to the Grave a true and faithful <HI>Friend.</HI> Lord sanctify her Death to me: Awaken in me proper tho'ts of my own Frailty and Mortality. I might have been taken away and she spar'd.— Lord let me see thy great Mer∣cy in sparing me, and be fitted to live to Thee and to die to Thee. Spare and heal those that are visited in the <HI>Town,</HI> and bless it, and thy Churches in it, and all the Rulers of it; and forgive mine Enemies for Christ's sake.</P>
<P>In the same Book <HI>Octob.</HI> 25. 1721, I find her praising God, and exto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing his Goodness, in spa∣ring her when so many <HI>Hundreds</HI> were swept a∣way by this Judgment.— Also a particular Record of Dr. <HI>Noyes</HI>'s Death, with some Re∣marks and Prayers, entred <HI>March</HI> 29. 1721.—</P>

<HEAD>Psalm cxxxvii. Paraphras'd, <HI>August</HI> 5th. 1725. Aetat. 17.</HEAD>
<L>AS on the Margin of Euphrates Flood</L>
<L>We wail'd our Sins, and mourn'd an angry GOD;</L>
<L>For GOD provok'd to strangers gave our Land</L>
<L>And by a righteous Judge condemn'd we stand;</L>
<L>Deep were our Groans, our Griefs without compare,</L>
<L>With ardent Cries we rent the yielding Air.</L>
<L>Born down with Woes no Friend at hand was found,</L>
<L>No Helper in the waste and barren Ground;</L>
<L>Only a mournful <HI>Willow</HI> wither'd there,</L>
<L>Its aged Arms by Winter Storms made bare,</L>
<L>On this our <HI>Lyres,</HI> now useless grown we hung,</L>
<L>Our <HI>Lyres</HI> by us forsaken and unstrung!</L>
<L>We sigh'd in Chains, and sunk beneath our Woe,</L>
<L>Whilst more insulting our proud <HI>Tyrants</HI> grow.</L>
<L>From Hearts opprest with Grief they did require</L>
<L>A sacred <HI>Anthem</HI> on the sounding Lyre:</L>
<L>Come, now, they Cry, regale us with a Song,</L>
<L>Musick and Myrth the fleeting Hours prolong,</L>
<L>Shall <HI>Babels Daughter</HI> hear that blessed Sound?</L>
<L>Shall Songs Divine be sung in heathen Ground?</L>

<L>O <HI>Palestina</HI>! our once dear Abode,</L>
<L>Thou once wert blest with Peace, and lov'd by GOD!</L>
<L>But now art desolate, a barren waste,</L>
<L>Thy fruitful Fields by Thorns and Weeds defac'd.</L>
<L>If I forget <HI>Judea's</HI> mournful Land,</L>
<L>May nothing prosper that I take in Hand!</L>
<L>Or if I string the Lyre, or tune my Voice,</L>

<L>O may my <HI>Tongue</HI> forget her Art to move,</L>

<SALUTE>My Dear Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur's of the fifth Instant was exceeding pleasant to me, both your Paraphrase on the 137 <HI>Psalm,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Letter</HI> that inclos'd it. In the Letter you wish you might inherit something of your Father's Soul and therein his Gifts. If that be worthy of your Desire God has in a great Measure given it to you; only you must go on by Reading and Study to improve the Powers which God has given you. My poor Gift is in thinking and writing with a little Eloquence, and a poetical turn of Thought. This, in proportion to the Advan∣tages you have had, under the necessary and useful Restraints of your Sex, you enjoy to the full of what I have done before you. With the Advantages of my liberal Education at School &amp; College, I have no reason to think but that your Genius in Writing would have excell'd mine. But there is no great Progress or Improvement ever made in any thing but by Use and Industry and Time. If you dili∣gently improve your stated and some vacant Hours every Day or Week to read your <HI>Bible,</HI> and other useful Books, you will insensibly
<PB N="70" REF="003888_0080_10031877FABD0490"/>
grow in Knowlege and Wisdom, fine Tho'ts and good Judgment, from Year to Year, to the Pleasure of your Friends, the Profit of your Children, if God give you any, and to your own spiritual and everlasting Advantage; if you direct all unto, and govern it by the Glory of God. But as to a Poetical Flight now and then, let it be with you only a thing by the by. At your leisure and spare Hours you may indulge your Inclinations this way. But let them not break in either upon the daily Hours of secret Reading or Devotion. — So you shall consecrate your Heart &amp; Life, your Muse and your daily Works, to the Honour of <HI>Christ</HI> in the Way of your own Salvation.</P>
<P>You ask me to forgive the flow of your Affections, which run with so swift a Current of filial Duty as may carry you beyond your self sometimes, and make you wanting in that Respect which you aim at expressing". It is true, my <HI>Dear,</HI> that a young fond and musical Genius is easily carry'd away thus; and never more than when it runs into the Praises of what it loves; and I would have you there∣fore careful against this Error, even when you say your Tho'ts of Reverence and Esteem to your <HI>Father,</HI> or to a <HI>Spouse</HI> if ever you should live to have one. It is easy to be lavish and run into foolish Flatteries. I think you have done well to correct your Self for some of your Excursions of this kind toward me. Your <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> is pleas'd with your love; and <HI>you</HI> are but a poor partial Judge of his Gifts or Vir∣tues.—But if you see any thing of Christ in any, and whatever things are <HI>just,</HI> whatever
<PB N="71" REF="003888_0081_1003187AE789E708"/>
things are <HI>lovely,</HI> think of these things and i∣mitate them.</P>
<P>You desire me to correct the faults in your Verses. I have always done that freely, both as to your Prose and Verse. Nor be discou∣rag'd hereby, but instructed. It is your learn∣ing time, and I am not asham'd of my <HI>Pupil.</HI>— But you have taken the last Paper of Verses with you, which prevents my sending you any Emendations of them. Commendation of them in the general I do however send. The serious melancholy <HI>Psalm</HI> is well turn'd in the most parts of it, considering your Years and Advantages for such a Performance. You speak of a single <HI>wither'd Willow</HI> which they hung their Harps on; but <HI>Euphrates</HI> was co∣ver'd with Willows along the Banks of it, so that it has been call'd <HI>the River of Willows.</HI> I hope, my Dear, your Lyre will not be hung on such a sorrowful <HI>Shrub.</HI> Go on in sacred Songs, and we'll hang it on the stately <HI>Cedars of Lebanon.</HI> Or let the pleasant <HI>Elm</HI> before the Door where you are suffice for you. — Give my love to Mr. P— and Madam, who receive you with such Courtesie and Love. We wish their pleasant Air and Conversation may serve your Health both of Body and Mind; and that your Company may be of some Pleasure and Use to them.</P>

<P>These were the early <HI>Essays</HI> of her Youth at <HI>Poetry,</HI> in which it must be freely own'd that as there are many things <HI>good</HI> and <HI>ingenious,</HI> so there is a great deal low and juvenile; which the candid understanding Reader will be ready to excuse from that common Rule of <HI>a Child's speaking and writing as a Child.</HI> At the same time, the Turn of the Mind here evident to God and Religion, is what the Pious will esteem and praise, and it is to be wish'd that Children may be taken herewith and drawn to imitate.— It is eno' (as her honour'd Father elegantly express'd it to me) if they may be accepted as a <HI>green offer∣ing of First-fruits bro't to the Door of the Sanctua∣ry,</HI> the promising <HI>Earnest</HI> of a future Harvest: at least, as the first lisping of the Tongue at Words is a pleasing <HI>Music</HI> to the Ear of the <HI>Mother,</HI> and the first Efforts of the <HI>Mind</HI> at Reasoning de∣lightful to a <HI>Father,</HI> so are the first Risings of a natural <HI>Genius</HI> unto a wise Observer.</P>
<P>(2.) In <HI>Prose</HI> there are also many Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some Essay to write her own <HI>Life,</HI> which begins with Thanksgivings to God for distinguish∣ing her from most in the World by the Blessings
<PB N="76" REF="003888_0086_10031883AD4BF668"/>
of <HI>Nature, Providence</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> which she spe∣cifies and enumerates in the following manner,</P>
<P N="1">(1) I thank God for my Immortal <HI>Soul,</HI> and that <HI>Reason</HI> &amp; Understanding which distin∣guishes me from the lower Creation.</P>
<P N="2">(2) For my Birth in a <HI>Christian Country,</HI> in a Land of Light, where the true God and Jesus Christ are known.</P>
<P N="3">(3) For pious and honourable <HI>Parents,</HI> where∣by I am favour'd beyond many others.</P>
<P N="4">(4) For faithful and godly <HI>Ministers,</HI> who are from time to time shewing me the Way of Sal∣vation.</P>
<P N="5">(5) For a <HI>Polite</HI> as well as <HI>Christian</HI> Education.</P>
<P N="6">(6) For <HI>restraining Grace,</HI> that I have been with-held from more open and gross Violations of God's holy Laws.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Her Tho'ts on Matrimony, with the Rules whereby she resolved to guide her Self in that im∣portant Affair of Life.</HI></P>
<P>She writes of the Wisdom and Goodness of God in making Man a <HI>Sociable</HI> Creature; of the Institution of Marriage in the paradisaical State, and the Happiness of the <HI>first Couple</HI>; and what alone will render Persons <HI>happy</HI> in our fallen State; namely, a faithful Discharge of all the <HI>Duties</HI> of that Relation; and then particulari∣ses the Duties, and treats of the Mischiefs that follow upon the Neglect of them; Shews at large what their Duty is who are about to enter into that State, namely, to seek to God by hum∣ble Prayer for his Direction and Conduct, and that he would over-rule all the Circumstances
<PB N="77" REF="003888_0087_100318854A106A80"/>
of that momentous Affair in Mercy, on which so much of the Comfort and Pleasure of Life depends.—She carries her Tho'ts to the Afflicti∣ons and Temptations of that Condition, and Prays for sufficient Grace to carry aright un∣der all. And for her Assistance in making a right Choice she laid down a Number of <HI>Rules,</HI> from which she resolves never to start: Some of them are the following,</P>
<P N="1">(1) I would admit the Addresses of no Person who is not descended of pious and credible Pa∣rents.</P>
<P N="2">(2) Who has not the Character of a strict <HI>Moralist,</HI> sober, temperate, just and honest.</P>
<P N="3">(3) <HI>Diligent</HI> in his Business, and <HI>prudent</HI> in Matters.</P>
<P N="4">(4) <HI>Fixt in his Religion,</HI> a constant Attender on the publick Worship, and who appears not in God's House with the Gravity becoming a Christian.</P>
<P N="5">(5) Of a sweet and agreable <HI>Temper</HI>; for if he be Owner of all the former good Qualifica∣tions, and fails here, my Life will be still un∣comfortable.</P>
<P N="3">3. Many Letters to her <HI>honoured Father</HI> on various Occasions.</P>
<P>I shall only present you with one dated <HI>June</HI> 11<HI>th.</HI> 1725.</P>

I beg your Prayers for me that as I grow in Years I may grow in Grace, and persevere therein. I pray you to forgive the many Faults in my present Writing, and subscribe my self with all Humility,</P>

<P>Before She had seen <HI>Eighteen,</HI> she had read, and (in some measure) digested all the English <HI>Poetry,</HI> and polite Pieces in <HI>Prose,</HI> printed and Manuscripts in her Father's well furnish'd Li∣brary, and much she borrow'd of her Friends and Acquaintance. She had indeed such a Thirst after knowlege that the Leisure of the Day did not suffice, but she spent whole Nights in reading.</P>
<P>I find she was sometimes fir'd with a laudable Ambition of raising the honour of her <HI>Sex,</HI> who are therefore under Obligations to her; and all will be ready to own she had a fine <HI>Genius,</HI> and is to be placed among those who have excell'd.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="003888_0089_1003065F403B8260"/>When I was first indin'd (by the Motions of God's Providence and Spirit) to seek her Ac∣quaintance (which was about the Time she en∣tred her <HI>nineteenth</HI> Year) I was surpriz'd and charm'd to find her so accomplish'd. I found her in a good measure Mistress of the politest <HI>Writers</HI> and their Works; could point out the Beauties in them, and had made many of their best Tho'ts her own: And as she went into more free Conversation, she discours'd how ad∣mirably on many Subjects!</P>
<P>I grew by Degrees into such an Opinion of her good <HI>Taste,</HI> that when she put me upon translating a <HI>Psalm</HI> or two, I was ready to ex∣cuse my Self, and if I had not fear'd to displease her should have deny'd her Request.</P>
<P>After her <HI>Marriage</HI> which was on <HI>August</HI> 11th. 1726, her Custom was once in a Month or two, to make some <HI>new Essay</HI> in Verse or Prose, and to read from Day to Day as much as a faithful Discharge of the Duties of her new Condition gave Leisure for: and I think I may with Truth say, that she made the writing of Poetry a <HI>Recreation</HI> and not a <HI>Business.</HI></P>
<P>What greatly contributed to increase her Knowlege in <HI>Divinity, History, Physick, Contro∣versy,</HI> as well as <HI>Poetry,</HI> was her attentive hear∣ing most that I read upon those Heads thro' the long Evenings of the Winters as we sat together.</P>
<P>Some of the many remarkable things she wrote in her <HI>Marriage State</HI> are the following; some in <HI>Verse,</HI> and more in <HI>Prose.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Novemb.</HI> 1st 1731. She sent her <HI>Father</HI> the following Letter, with an <HI>Encomium</HI> on Sir <HI>Ri∣chard
<PB N="80" REF="003888_0090_1003188FD3026CB0"/>
Blackmore</HI>'s Poetical Works.—She knew it would be pleasing eno' to her <HI>Father,</HI> to hear her sing in Praise of Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> of whom she always heard him speak with great Esteem; not as the first of <HI>Poets,</HI> but as one of the best; con∣secrating his Muse to the cause of <HI>Virtue</HI> &amp; <HI>Re∣ligion,</HI> with a most noble Aim to inspire the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Nobles</HI> of the Nation, with the true Sentiments of Glory and Usefulness; than which nothing could be more worthy of a <HI>Christian Poet</HI> and an <HI>English Patriot.</HI> And as such He is celebrated in the following <HI>Poem.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOT having the Happiness of seeing You as I desire, I wait on you with a <HI>Poem.</HI> The first fourteen Lines were written in 1725, and have lain by ever since: I added the rest in some vacant Hours the last Week. I sub∣mit the whole to your Candor and kind Cor∣rection, which I am sure they very much need, and I shall with all Thankfulness receive. I find my Inclinations to <HI>Poetry</HI> still continue, tho' I hope I do not follow them to the o∣mitting more necessary Things. It is my Study and Endeavour to be a <HI>Blessing.</HI> And I ask your Prayers that I may be so to You and to all to whom I am related. &amp;c.</P>

<P>Her <HI>Father</HI> in his next Letter call'd this Poem <HI>a rich Present,</HI> and told her his Opinion that Sir <HI>Richard</HI> and his Works were worthy of her highest Esteem, and far above all her Praises.

That he knew it was his Purity and Virtue, his Piety and Devotion that charm'd her Heart: And that this well became the Daughter and Wife of a <HI>Minister</HI> of the Gospel.

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have been about Writing to you a great while, but thinking I could better Speak than write my Tho'ts caus'd me to delay. But not knowing how long it may be before I see you by reason of the Weather, and my present Indisposition, I take this Opportunity to trouble you with my <HI>Fears and Doubts.</HI> I know of none in this World I can so well apply to for Comfort as your Self, and I doubt not but you are both able and willing to advise me how to behave under them.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="003888_0097_100318986FC3DFF0"/>This is the short and broken Account of my Soul at present. Sometimes my Sins come pressing on my Mind, and appear so black and numerous that I am quite amazed. I look all around, and see a World of Vanities, which can yield me no Comfort, much less any Help. Only in <HI>Christ</HI> is my Help found; O that I had <HI>Faith</HI> to lay hold on him, and <HI>Love</HI> to join my Soul to him! — The last Week I was in great Distress, I could not go to Christ, nor hope in him, nor pray to him, nor take any Comfort from any thing I heard, read or discours'd about. — I seem in a maze, that such a Sinner as I, am spar'd from day to day; and admire at the Patience of God in giving me a space for Repentance. O that he would give me Grace to repent!— Often in a Day I think what would become of me if I should die? I think, if it were possible, I could open my very Breast, and tear the accursed thing <HI>Sin</HI> out of it. But since I can't wholly take it out, or drive it out, I look to God for his Grace that I may more mortify and subdue it, and prevent it's reigning in me.— Sometimes I feel in a Tumult by reason of <HI>Blasphemous Tho'ts</HI> crowding in upon me, and wicked, revengeful, quarrelsome Tho'ts rising up in me. I find also rash passionate Expressions ready to break thro' the doors of my Lips. Yet I bless God who has re∣strain'd me by his Grace from consenting to the one, or uttering the other. I hope I can truly say, <HI>My Soul abhors them.</HI>— I often mourn the Loss of that <HI>Time</HI> I have spent in reading <HI>useless Books,</HI> which I am sensible had been better improv'd in working out my Souls Salvation. I frequently take up that Lamentation, <HI>"How have I hated Instruction,</HI> &amp;c.— I feel my Heart at times <HI>harder than an Adamant,</HI> at other times by reason of God's <HI>Ter∣rors I am Distracted.</HI> The Things that <HI>once</HI> appear'd in∣nocent Amusements, <HI>now</HI> appear to be sinful. It amazes me to think that one so Young as I, scarce <HI>Twenty</HI> Years Old, should have heap'd up so much Sin and Guilt. I dare not stay away from the <HI>House of God,</HI> but when I am there, my Heart is as the <HI>Way Side,</HI> and <HI>Stony Ground</HI> to the Seed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own.— I am very sensible, tho' it is my <HI>Duty</HI> to apply to you for Advice, that it is not in the <HI>Power</HI> of the dearest and holiest Relation in the World to afford me any more than their Pity, Prayers and Coun∣sels. The Tho'ts of my Approaching every Day nearer to the <HI>Grave,</HI> in such a Condition, adds to my Terror and Distress. O let not Death come upon me until God is

in and thro' Christ reconciled unto me! But Amidst all my Spiritual Troubles that Text has afforded me some Comfort,—<HI>Shall he bring to the Birth, and not cause to bring forth</HI>?</P>
<P>I can't but <HI>hope</HI> after all that God has begun a good Work in me; and will he not carry it on and finish it? I would hope that in his own Time he will deliver my Soul from all her Sins and Fears — I bless God I have not been without Supports and Consolations from him in my dark Hours.— I have been much at a loss about laying hold on and applying the Promises, and when I have been (searching my <HI>Bible</HI> to find out a Pro∣mise, that Scripture has come full in my Mind, <HI>What last thou to do to take my Covenant into thy Mouth</HI>?—But I have lately met with a Book <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Godly Man's Ark.</NOTE> of Mr. <HI>Calamy's</HI> that has greatly instructed and comforted me on that Head. —I know not what to think of my Self; sometimes I fear I never had an Interest in Christ, but am an Hy∣pocrite: At other times I think I am Sincere: I am sure I desire to be so—I am more mortify'd to the World since the <HI>Earthquake,</HI> and love is less. I desire and pray I may be so wise as to lay up my Treasure in Heaven where it will be sure; and to have my <HI>Heart</HI> there also.—I commend my self now, Honoured Sir, to your Blessing and Prayers, which I doubt not but I constantly have, and remain your Dutiful <HI>Daughter.</HI>—</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Letter of the 6th Instant both affects and comforts me exceedingly. I tenderly feel all your Tears and Distress, the Pain and Anguish of your Soul, and am distressed for you. But I rejoyce too to see you sorrowing after a godly sort, for <HI>godly Sorrow worketh Re∣pentance unto Salvation never to be repented of.</HI> Think it not strange (my Dearest) that you are under such Pressure of Spirit, and are bow'd down heavily, for it is no more than what many of the dear Children of <HI>God</HI> have ex∣perienc'd, and they have been to them as the <HI>Pangs of the New Birth</HI>: These will be remembred with <HI>Joy</HI> if you are indeed <HI>born to God</HI>; as the sorrows of Child∣bed are forgotten for Joy that there is a Child born.</P>
<P>Thanks be to <HI>God</HI> who makes <HI>Sin,</HI> and the Sins of your <HI>Youth</HI> (which yet has been very innocent if compared to that of many other Young People, who have neverthe∣less become eminent for Grace and Holiness) appear so evil and amazing to you; and Thanks be to God who gives you such a Sense of the Vanity of all things under the Sun, without an Interest in <HI>Christ</HI> and a better Life:
<PB N="90" REF="003888_0100_1003974B1D748ED0"/>
Let these united Convictions carry you to him as all your Salvation.</P>
<P>You admire the <HI>Patience</HI> of God toward you; O ad∣mire his Grace and <HI>Favour</HI> to you, that he is now, and thus early, working on you by his Holy Spirit; convinc∣ing and awakening you, humbling and striving with you. You think what would become of you if you should die! But thank God that the Day of Life and of Grace is still continued, and make your renewed Flight to the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> for Pardon and Cleansing, and the closing of your Soul with him; and trust your Soul with him, <HI>"Yea tho' he slay me I will trust in him.</HI></P>
<P>It ought greatly to comfort you, that you can say, <Q>You think of your Sins with loathing and hatred, that you desire to get Sin mortif'd and subdued that it may not reign in you.</Q> This is a Sign of true Grace, and if it be the abiding governing Frame of your Soul, it will be a happy Fruit and Evidence of it: the Lord fix and increase this in you.</P>
<P>O I hope God means of his free Grace to make you a holy and happy Woman, a gracious Wife, Mother, and Mistress in your House, a Blessing in your Place, and blessed for ever. I have Joy in you my dear Child, in this Hope and Prospect.</P>
<P>I am sorry to hear of the <HI>Temptations</HI> that assault you, but rejoyce in the <HI>Res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raints</HI> you speak of. <HI>Christ</HI> him∣self was thus tempted, and so have all the dear Children of God been; He is <HI>able to succour them that are tempted,</HI> and ready to do it; and to <HI>bruise Satan under their Feet.</HI> Fly to him, who knows how to have Compassion, and who said to <HI>Peter,</HI> <Q>I have prayed for thee that thy Faith fail not, tho' Satan has desir'd to sift thee.</Q> He said to <HI>Paul</HI> as he cry'd thrice under the Thorn, <Q><HI>My Grace is sufficient for thee.</HI></Q></P>
<P>You mourn the time spent in reading <HI>useless Books</HI>; you do well, I am glad you see the Emptiness and Folly of them: Mr. <HI>Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll</HI> has a Library for you to be re∣pairing to, let him put proper and <HI>profitable</HI> Books into your Hand.</P>

I am glad to see the Sense you have of the <HI>Appearance</HI> of Evil, and the Weight of the <HI>least</HI> Sins upon your tender Soul. Because <HI>Josiah</HI>'s Heart was <HI>tender</HI> the Lord loved him, and <HI>the high and lofty One looks to him that is of a contrite Spirit, to revive the Spirit of the humble and the Heart of the contrite ones.</HI> To be sure there is a great deal of Sin in a vain and careless <HI>trifling away</HI> our Time and Days.

Remem∣ber, my <HI>Dear,</HI> the <HI>infinite Mercies</HI> and Compassions of God to a repenting Sinner, that casts a perishing Soul on the Merits of Christ▪ How was the <HI>Prodigal Son</HI> received of his Father? Read <HI>Luke</HI> 15. How was the <HI>Woman</HI> that had been a great Sinner receiv'd by Christ, when she lay at his Feet? <HI>Luke</HI> 7 44. And what Grace did the <HI>trem∣bling</HI> Woman find in this fight? <HI>Luke.</HI> 8.47. And are your Sins so many and great, my <HI>Child,</HI> that they mayn't find the like Mercy? yea and like <HI>Love</HI> from Christ? Do not <HI>fear,</HI> do not <HI>doubt</HI> it in the least: Be not afraid with any Amazements: trust in free, rich, sovereign, infinite Mercy. —<Q>You are amaz'd that one so <HI>Young</HI> as you should have <HI>heap'd</HI> up such a Load of Guilt,</Q> you say: O stand <HI>amaz'd</HI> at what God has wro't in Christ Jesus for the Salvation of the greatest Sinners; having laid on Him the Iniquity of us all, and called every <HI>weary and heavy laden Soul</HI> to him for rest. Ah my Child, thy Sins are <HI>few and little</HI> compar'd to Thou∣sands of whom Christ has saved! And were thy Sins a thousand fold more and greater than they are, they would be all forgiven upon thy penitent believing Flight to Christ for Pardon and Sanctification. Yet your Sins <HI>should</HI> appear as they do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you, if they had not been <HI>half</HI> so many and great as they are.</P>
<P><HI>As a Father pitieth his Children, so the Lord them that fear him,</HI> Psal. 103.

<P>Satan would turn <HI>Scriptures</HI> against you, which are not meant to any in your present Frame; and wrest those from you which belong to you. <Q>What hast thou to do to take my Covenant into thy Mouth?</Q> Yes; every awakn'd, hum∣ble, mournful Soul, bleeding for Sin with a broken Heart, has a right to take hold on God's Covenant, and on all the Promises and Mercies of it; flying thereto <HI>for Refuge as the Hope set before him.</HI>—<HI>Turn to the strong Hold ye Prisoners of Hope.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear and only Sister,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THough we are absent, I hope we are not forgetful of each other. I am sure my Tho'ts are often employ'd about you, and I am daily concern'd for you. You have now just past your Childhood, and are arriv'd to that Stage of Life which is most expos'd to Snares and Temptations; and according as you behave in it, your Reflections will be uneasy or comfortable after∣wards. Think not the Counsels of a <HI>Sister,</HI> who loves you as her self, unseasonable; or the Effect of melan∣choly Vapours. No, It is from the best Love to you, and my great Desire to see you vertuous and happy.</P>
<P>Let me warn you then of the <HI>Vanity</HI> and Deceit there is in all Worldly Things, and urge you to imploy your <HI>Time</HI> in working out your Soul's Salvation; and therefore in learning those things that will help you Heavenward; and not spend it in those Pleasures that will not profit, or in those Follies and Sins which will in the End <HI>bite like a Serpent and sting like an Adder.</HI> — You have a pre∣cious Opportunity for Instruction and Improvement under the best of earthly Fathers. O then improve it to the best Purposes, lest you provoke God to deprive you of your Advantages, and take away your <HI>Father</HI> from your Head —O remember your Creator now, even <HI>now</HI> in the Days of your Youth: Let him have your first Love and Service: Keep in Mind what Christ the Wisdom of <HI>God</HI> says, <HI>I love them that love me, and those that seek me early shall find me.</HI> Fly to that great <HI>Shepard</HI> who takes the Lambs in his Bosom. He greatly delights in the Virtue and Piety of Young Persons.—When the <HI>Young Man</HI> in the Gospel came to Him with his serious Enqui∣ries about Eternal Life, Jesus <HI>beheld him and loved him. Joseph</HI> was beloved of his God for his early Piety, and because he fear'd to Sin against him in Private. <HI>Moses</HI> was honoured of God, and was taken into the nearest and most intimate Acquaintance with him because he despis'd the Pleasures of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and chose to suffer Affliction with the People of God God reveal'd himself to pious <HI>Samuel</HI> while he was yet a Child. Because young <HI>Josiah</HI>'s Heart
<PB N="95" REF="003888_0105_100397580FABB030"/>
was tender, therefore God bro't not the Evils in his Days. <HI>Timothy</HI> was remarkable also for his early Piety, and he was ordain'd young a Bishop at <HI>Ephesus.</HI></P>
<P>These and many more shining Examples might be produc'd. Look into your <HI>Bible</HI> and read them; and O that you might profit by reading them! But I cannot leave you without offering you one more, and that is the Incomparable Pattern and Example which our Lord Jesus Christ has left unto Young People to Copy after: O read his Life over and over, as it is given you by the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> and conform your's to it as far as possible. Beg of him his Holy Spirit, and gracious Assistances; and he will own your Endeavours and accept you. O how does God delight in the Blossoms of his Gardens! Their Scent is fragrant in his Nostrils!</P>
<P>O <HI>My Dear,</HI> let me beg of you not to spend any part of your precious Time in reading <HI>Romances</HI> or idle <HI>Poems,</HI> which tend only to raise false <HI>Ideas</HI> and impure Images in the Mind, and leave a vile Tincture upon it.</P>
<P><HI>Flee Youthful Lusts; and follow after Holiness without which no Man shall see the Lord.</HI> Let it be your constant Care to begin and end every Day with secret <HI>Prayer</HI> to God; and reading a Portion of the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> Be deligent at Work, eat not the Bread of Idleness. Have respect to all God's Commandments. Never dare to profane God's Name, or Sabbath. Be dutiful and shew all Reverence to your Parents. O remem∣ber the <HI>Fifth</HI> Commandment; study the Promises and Threatnings of it. Put away all Childish things. Behave your self Womanly, and like a <HI>Christian</HI> to all with whom you converse. Indulge not a passionate or fretful Temper; much less a haughty or insulting Carriage towards the meanest Servant in the Family. Be obliging, and modest, and humble, so shall you deserve and have the Esteem of every Body. Hearken to In∣struction, and let your Ears be open to <HI>Reproof.</HI> Be thank∣ful to and pray for them that are so kind as to admo∣nish you. Be contented with your Lot; wish not your self in another's Place, or that you had another's Liberty. There are but Few in Town favour'd on all Accounts

as you are: think so, and bless God for distinguishing you.—I have many more things to say when I see you. So earnestly beseeching you to turn to the Lord, in and thro' Jesus Christ; to the keeping of whose Grace I commend both your Soul and mine.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>NAbby</HI> has your dear Letter, she thanks you for it; your <HI>Mother</HI> and I do so more. We love you more than ever. We prize it beyond an Ingot of Gold. It is more precious than <HI>Rubies,</HI> an <HI>Ornament</HI> of Grace, and better than <HI>Chains</HI> for the Neck. Your <HI>Sister</HI> can't read it for Tears: may it enter deep into her Heart. You have done a <HI>Sister</HI>'s part, and acted like One converted to God, desiring to carry your only &amp; younger Sister with you. You have amass'd the most excellent <HI>Rules</HI> for her, with the strongest <HI>Motives,</HI> and put them in the best <HI>order.</HI> Your Letter is worthy to be printed in Types of Gold. Such is your <HI>Father</HI>'s Esteem of it! What then think you is his Joy in you for writing of it? —Go on, my <HI>Dearest,</HI> in your Care for your own Soul, and the Souls of your dear Relatives. Continue your tender Solici∣tude for your dear <HI>Sister.</HI> God make her a <HI>Blessing</HI> to you and your <HI>Crown</HI>; as You are to us.— When God gives you <HI>Children,</HI> as I

hope he will, take such Care of <HI>them,</HI> more and better than We have of you; and may <HI>the Blessing of Abraham</HI> be on them.— And now my <HI>Dear,</HI> live joyfully with him thou lovest, the tenderest of Husbands; and go gladly with him toward Heaven; be help'd by him along and be helpful to him. Your <HI>Mother</HI> is melted with your Letter, and sends you a thousand <HI>Loves.</HI></P>

<P>I have several more <HI>Letters</HI> to show, which she wrote <HI>me</HI> from <HI>Boston</HI> in the Year 1729, in equal Strains of Piety. A Paragraph or two shall be offered.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>— I commit my Self and my Case into the Hands of a wise and gracious God, who knows what is best for me; and who will or∣der all things for the best. O may I continue in this Faith and Prayer, and so be prepar'd for the great <HI>Deliverances</HI> I stand in need of, both for Soul and Body.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Again,</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I thank you for your good Advice and Counsels, and pray I may have Grace given me to practice agreably. I have had large Experience of the Goodness of God in my former <HI>Travails,</HI> as well as thro' my whole Life, He is the same God, and the same to me: His Arm is not shortned, and I daily experi∣ence his Power and Goodness in preserving both the <HI>Tree</HI> and <HI>Fruit</HI>; I therefore will trust in Him. Let me always have your Prayers

<P>Here follows a remarkable One she wrote me from her Chamber.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU must forgive my <HI>Infirmity</HI> in not ut∣tering my Griefs to day. I tho't you might have guess'd the State of my Mind by my Countenance. I am under great Fears and Doubts, about my Eternal Welfare, and my Soul is exceeding heavy. My Sins stare me in the Face, my Guilt confounds me. I have sinned against such clear Light and so many Mercies, that I am asham'd and blush to lift up my Face to God.— One particular that grieves me to Day is my being <HI>over merry</HI> in Company the last Night.— Another, that I can't p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay without the utmost Confusedness. When I rise from my Knees I tremble for fear I have enhanced my Guilt; and that Scripture d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>esses me,— <HI>The Prayers of the Wicked are an Abomination to the Lord:</HI> Yet I follow after God in the Dark, and hope he will be found of me, and be better to me than my Fears. What shall I do? tell me freely, and resolve me quickly.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="99" REF="003888_0109_10039768F3C5D090"/>Upon the Receipt of this <HI>Script</HI> I observed unto her, that it was truly an <HI>Infirmity,</HI> and a very <HI>faulty</HI> one, to hide her <HI>Griefs</HI>; it being no other than a piece of <HI>Cruelty</HI> upon her self, and aggravated, in as much as she had many a time found Relief by laying them open to her Friends. — That God only knows the <HI>Hearts</HI> of all the Children of Men, and that the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untenance</HI> is a most uncertain Rule for any to guess the State of a Person by.— As to her Fears and Doubts about her Eternal Welfare founded on the <HI>Greatness</HI> of her Sins, I told her she well knew it was as easy for infinite Power and Mercy and Grace to save from <HI>many</HI> Sins as from few, from <HI>great</HI> as from <HI>small</HI>; that the Promise of Pardon was made to true Penitents let the De∣gree of their Guilt be what it would. — That the particular she mention'd, of being <HI>over merry</HI> in Company, prov'd nothing against her. Her Heart's troubling her for it was like <HI>David</HI>'s Heart's smiting him for cutting off <HI>Saul</HI>'s skirt, which for any thing that appears in Scripture, proceeded from meer <HI>Tenderness of Conscience,</HI> a Fear least something might be amiss.—That her not being able to pray with desir'd <HI>Composure</HI> and <HI>Affection</HI> must not be tho't to affect her <HI>State.</HI> Her present unhappy <HI>Frame</HI> might proceed from bodily Indisposition, natural &amp; not <HI>moral</HI> Cau∣ses, which is oftner the Occasion of such Frames in God's People than most are sensible of; and that she ought not to draw up <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nclusions</HI> about her State either from the <HI>Ebb or Flow</HI> of her Affections, but from the <HI>Bent</HI> and Sincerity of her Heart, and Course of her Life. — That her Fears about her Prayers being an <HI>Abomina∣tion</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="003888_0110_1003976C1AFFE168"/>
were ill-grounded; for more was intended by <HI>Wicked</HI> in that Scripture then she imagin'd; and I hardly thought she would own her Self the <HI>resolved Sinner,</HI> delighting in Sin and com∣mitting it with Greediness: Nay that she prov'd the contrary by what she added of her <HI>following God in the Dark, and hoping in him</HI> —Upon the whole, I led her to <HI>Christ</HI> the true Light, and told her, tho' Grief endureth for a Night, yet Joy would come in the Morning: For they that <HI>sow in such Tears of Humiliation and Repentance,</HI> will anon <HI>reap the Joys of Assurance.</HI></P>
<P>I now repair to her <HI>Diary,</HI> which filled much faster after <HI>Marriage</HI> than before: wherein she takes notice of God's Providences to her <HI>Self,</HI> her <HI>Friends,</HI> and the <HI>Land</HI> in general.</P>
<P>There is in it the <HI>Covenant,</HI> in Mr. <HI>Alleine</HI>'s Form, solemnly <HI>Subscrib'd</HI> with her Hand, and often <HI>Renew'd</HI> on Sacramental and other Oc∣casions.</P>
<P>It is not very easy to methodize a <HI>Christian</HI>'s <HI>Diary,</HI> and place every thing under distinct and proper Heads. In her Books there is notice taken of <HI>These</HI> among other Things.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="diary">
<HEAD><HI>(1)</HI> Her Mercies and Deliverances, Afflictions and S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrows.</HEAD>
<P>Upon the Receipt of any <HI>Favour</HI> 'tis common for her to write thus,— <Q>What shall I render to the Lord for all his Benefits, and for this Benefit! O that I could live more to the Ho∣nour of God, than ever I have yet done! I
<PB N="101" REF="003888_0111_1003976F36724350"/>
will bless the Lord while I live, and sing Praises to him while I have any Being! May I never forget the Mercy.</Q></P>
<P>In the Close of <HI>Years,</HI> and also on her <HI>Birth Days,</HI> she enumerates God's Favours Temporal and Spiritual unto her; and is sometimes very particular, and always full in her grateful Ac∣knowlegements.</P>
<P>She writes more or less upon the <HI>Births</HI> of all her Children, and of the Circumstances of her Travails; and never forgets to sing of <HI>Mercy,</HI> whatsoever Judgment and Affliction was mix'd with it.</P>
<P>On her <HI>first Child,</HI> among many other Things she writes,— <Q>It pleased God of his infinite Mercy to command a great Deliverance for me.—Blessed be his Name! Tho' my Womb became as it were a Tomb to my <HI>Infant,</HI> yet will I not forget his wonderful Appearing for me, when my Senses were lock'd up, and saving me alive</Q>—She knew nothing of her Delivery till two Days after it.</P>
<P>There is but a short Record of the Birth and Death of her <HI>second</HI> Child (<HI>Clark Thomas</HI>) who liv'd Eleven Days. She <HI>pray'd for a Name better than of Sons and Daughters.</HI> But all the Family remember the many <HI>Tears of Joy</HI> and Thankful∣ness she shed at the Presentation of this Child to God in holy <HI>Baptism,</HI> and her more than com∣mon <HI>Composure</HI> of Mind and Quietness at it's Death and <HI>Funeral.</HI></P>
<P>On this Occasion I find her Father writing to her, <Q>I thank God who has carried you, my dear <HI>Child,</HI> with so much Courage and Strength of Grace, thro' the Pains of bearing, and now
<PB N="102" REF="003888_0112_100397AAB5804DE8"/>
of <HI>burying</HI> your Infant. He help'd you to offer up your Son to him in Baptism with so <HI>many Tears,</HI> and now to resign and commit it to the Grave with so <HI>few.</HI> May all Supplies of Grace be given in unto you from time to time, and the Power of it be always exhi∣bited by you to the Glory of your Saviour, who has given you his strong Consolations a∣gainst the Hour you have been call'd to pass thro'.</Q></P>
<P>On the Birth of her surviving Son, she not only blesses God, but receives him thankfully as <HI>an Answer of many Prayers,</HI> and writes, <Q><HI>For this Child I prayed, and the Lord hath given me my Petition which I asked of him:</HI> Therefore my Desire is that my <HI>Samuel</HI> be lent to the Lord, and be employ'd by Him in his Service in his Church. Lord do thou graciously ac∣cept of him, and furnish him, and let him do more and better for Thee than any of his <HI>Pro∣genitors.</HI></Q></P>
<P>May God graciously answer the Prayers and Desires of his <HI>Handmaid,</HI> and our <HI>little Son</HI> be greatly Affected and Influenc'd, when he comes to read and understand this <HI>Paragraph.</HI></P>
<P>At another Time when she was delivered of a <HI>Son alone,</HI> the Surprize and Distress of which hazardous Minute every one may easily think of; she writes,</P>
<P><Q>Blessed be God, who has appear'd for me in such an Hour of Distress and Danger! I can never eno' admire the Goodness and Mercy and Power of <HI>God</HI> in composing me, and in∣spiring me with Courage and Conduct at this Time. It shall be said, <HI>In the Mount of the Lord
<PB N="103" REF="003888_0113_100397ADD024A8F0"/>
it shall be seen</HI>!—No humane Help was nigh, the Lord <HI>was my Helper, and that right early.</HI> O that I may ever be impress'd with a deep Sense of this Mercy.</Q></P>
<P>There is a <HI>Poem</HI> also composed by her on some of these Occasions, and many other Passages in her <HI>Diary,</HI> wherein she declares she had laid hold on the <HI>Covenant</HI> for <HI>her Self</HI> and for her <HI>Chil∣dren</HI>; and her <HI>Faith</HI> concerning them, and <HI>Hopes</HI> to meet the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t the Right Hand of Christ a∣nother Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>

<Q>In giving me (she writes) a <HI>Space</HI> to repent, and I hope <HI>Grace</HI> to repent also.</Q></P>
<P>She records the Death of her Friend Mrs. <HI>Wigglesworth,</HI> with earnest Prayers to be prepar'd for her own, <Q>Lord, says she, let me be recon∣ciled unto Thee by the Death of thy Son, and then the King of Terrors cannot harm me.

<HEAD>(3.) <HI>Temptations</HI> and <HI>Distresses.</HI></HEAD>
<P>There has been something already offer'd on this Head by way of <HI>Letter.</HI> In her <HI>Diary</HI> are found these Passages.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 16. 1727. <Q>As I lay on my Bed under great Weakness of Body, meditating on God and expecting Death, it pleased my <HI>Heavenly Father</HI> to suffer the Enemy of my Soul to beset me with sore Temptations; particularly with that in Job 2.9. <HI>Curse God and die.</HI> I was long hurried by it, and yet in Horror at such a Tho't rising in me. I cry'd earnestly to God that I might not be left to consent to it; and upon my continuing instant in Prayer, that Scripture came with mighty Weight upon my Mind, Psal. 146.2. <HI>I will praise the Lord while I live, I will sing Praises to my God while I have any being:</HI> Which help'd me to repel the Temptation, and brought Comfort to me.</Q></P>
<P>At other times, <Q>I was tempted to a like <HI>Distrust and Denial of God</HI>; but thro' Grace I resisted and was ever directed to some Scrip∣ture or other to strengthen my Faith. And tho' I continued under Doubts &amp; Fears about my Spiritual State a great while, yet I could <HI>still hope in God,</HI> and encourage my self in his Goodness, which had been wonderful to me.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="003888_0119_100397C3E1341388"/>Another time she writes, <Q>Much distress'd on the account of <HI>wicked Tho'ts</HI> following me, but I hope God will preserve my Soul, and deliver me from them.— I trust in him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I was much tempted this afternoon to <HI>Blas∣phemy</HI> and <HI>Despair</HI> by my grand Enemy, (who is often of late in this manner disturbing my Quiet) but I fly to and trust in a <HI>tempted Sa∣viour,</HI> who knows how to succour me, and will deliver me, — I pray, <HI>Lord lead me not into Temptation but deliver me from Evil; Suffer me not to be tempted above what I am able to bear, but together with every Temptation make way for my Escape. Guide me by thy Counsel, and uphold me by thy free Spirit, and receive me to Glory.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Another time, <Q>Much distress'd on the Ac∣count of my Soul, just ready to sink under the Sense of Sin, and to despair of Mercy and Pardon for a time. But blessed be God who has kept me from adding to the Number of my Sins that fatal one of <HI>Despair.</HI> Christ has been discover'd to me as able to save unto the uttermost the very chief of Sinners, and all those that come to God by him without ex∣ception. His <HI>Blood</HI> cleanses from all Sin, and I fly to the <HI>Fountain</HI> of it to wash in. Give me Faith in Him, and to rely on his glorious Righteousness. Uphold me by thy Grace, and make me faithful in thy Covenant.</Q></P>
<P>Again, <Q>In the House of God greatly distress'd on the account of <HI>Deadness</HI> and <HI>Dulness</HI> under the Word preach'd. I did all I could to raise and fix my Tho'ts, but all in vain. I then lift up my Soul to God in and thro' Christ in
<PB N="110" REF="003888_0120_100397C5648745C8"/>
the best manner I was able, and earnestly beg'd Pardon for my Wandrings and Dulness; and beseech'd Him to open my Heart to re∣ceive Instruction, and afford me the Comforts and Teachings of his Spirit, and it was better with me</Q>. <HI>Behold Reader, a good Method to be taken by Thee in the like Frame!</HI></P>
<P>Another Time, <Q>I went to the House of God with a heavy Heart, resolving not to partake of the holy <HI>Sacrament</HI> in the Frame I was then in; lest I should dishonour God, and profane the Ordinance: but the <HI>Sermon</HI> I then heard on <HI>Justification by the Righteousness of Christ a∣lone,</HI> greatly encourag'd me, and I spent the Day in holy Delight and Pleasure.</Q></P>
<P>Another Time, <Q>This was a <HI>dark</HI> &amp; distressing Day to me; I was strongly <HI>tempted</HI> to <HI>absent</HI> my self from the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>Supper,</HI> on the Account of my not having spent so much Time in Preparation as usual. I pour'd out my Soul in Prayer to God for his Direction, and after much Conflict and Struggle resolv'd to venture: And after∣wards I fear'd whether I had not laid too great a <HI>Stress</HI> on my own Performances, Pray∣ers, Examinations and Renewals of Covenant heretofore; &amp; was happily brought <HI>to renounce all that was my own,</HI> and to depend wholly on Jesus Christ for Righteousness and Strength.</Q></P>

<HEAD>(4) <HI>Preparations for Church Communion,</HI> and other Matters relating thereunto.</HEAD>
<P>She was for many Years exceeding tho'tful a∣bout renewing her <HI>Baptismal Covenant,</HI> and giv∣ing up her Self to God before his People, and
<PB N="111" REF="003888_0121_100397C6E94DCE88"/>
coming to the <HI>Table of Christ.</HI> Her Fears were great lest <HI>coming unworthily she should eat and drink Judgment unto her self.</HI> She was often in an <HI>Agony,</HI> that she might <HI>draw near to God with a true Heart,</HI> and in the full Assurance of Faith. And her Endeavours were crown'd with a com∣fortable Hope when she came, which was on that <HI>memorable Day</HI> October 29. 1727, which preceeded the Great and Amazing <HI>Earthquake.</HI></P>
<P>The chief part of the Day before she spent in Secret, bewailing her Sins Original and Actual, intreating the Mercy of God to pardon, and his Grace to help her; 'in seeking the <HI>Wedding Garment,</HI> that she might appear adorn'd as <HI>a Bride for her Husband,</HI> and hear Christ saying to her at his Table, <HI>Daughter be of good chear, your Sins are forgiven you.</HI></P>
<P>On the Day after she makes a Record of her Admission, renews the Dedication of her Self to God; and seems to have had her Heart much drawn forth to Christ, by the vast Variety of Expressions she uses on this Occasion. She writes particularly of the <HI>Earthquake,</HI> and makes many pious and pertinent Reflections and Petitions. 'Lord awaken in me a more lively sense of thy Perfections, and of my Duty towards thee. O cause me to stand firm in the Truths and Ways of Christ. Make me stedfast in thy Covenant, that I may hold fast the Profession of my Faith without wavering, &amp;c.'</P>
<P>She usually spent a considerable part of the Saturday before the <HI>Sacrament</HI> in Preparation for it, and sometimes other Days.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="003888_0122_100397CA95AA3808"/>She writes that Company at such Seasons was very unwelcome and burdensome, and bewails it that she has been sometimes hindred by it.</P>
<P>Her strict and close Examinations of her Self before the Sacrament are noted down. The <HI>Word of God</HI> was her Rule, and the Marks and Signs of a good and bad State there given are what she judges upon.— I also find her making use of the Judgment of the best Divines &amp; Casuists. —Two Books one for Devotion, &amp; the other for Instruction generally lay on her Table on Com∣munion Days, namely Dr. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s <HI>Christian Sacrifice,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>'s <HI>Communicant</HI>'s <HI>Companion.</HI></P>
<P>In one of her Papers she answers all Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>'s <HI>Questions,</HI> under the Head of Self-Examination; namely, What <HI>am</HI> I? What <HI>have I done?</HI> What am I <HI>doing?</HI> What ground do I <HI>get?</HI> What do <HI>I want?</HI> What do I <HI>resolve</HI> to do? to her own Comfort and Satisfaction.</P>
<P><HI>Her Frames</HI> at the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>Table</HI> were very dif∣ferent, but always consistent with real and vital Religion.</P>
<P>Sometimes she seems overcome with <HI>Fears,</HI> and born down with Doubts and Scruples; but be∣fore she has finished her Record there is an evi∣dent Mourning after Christ, and an ardent Love to him discoverable.</P>
<P>There are those which she calls her <HI>uncomfor∣table Sabbaths and Sacraments,</HI> others her <HI>pleasant Days</HI> and <HI>joyful Communions.</HI> I observe that when she went laden with the most Fear, she generally brought home Comfort in return.</P>
<P>She writes once, <Q>I was exceeding dull and heavy, and ready to go away from the Sacra∣ment, but when I had resolved to stay, I pre∣sently
<PB N="113" REF="003888_0123_100397CE1DBE9FC0"/>
had what I desir'd, a composed Mind; and have not spent a Sabbath in such Pleasure for some time.</Q></P>
<P>Again, <Q>This being the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> and <HI>our Sacrament,</HI> I read over my <HI>Covenant</HI> and <HI>re∣new'd</HI> it: And tho' I felt not such <HI>flowings</HI> of my Affections as I have sometimes, yet I hope I was <HI>sincere.</HI> Lord accept of Sincerity, and graciously overlook my Infirmities; and meet me in thy <HI>House,</HI> and at thy <HI>Table,</HI> and let this <HI>Sabbath</HI> be a Day of <HI>Rest and Joy</HI> to my poor Soul.</Q></P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 16. 1732. <Q>I bless God that upon a careful <HI>Review</HI> of my Life, I have some Reason to hope that my Labour has not been in vain in the Lord, but that I am passed from Death to Life. <HI>Search me, O God, and know my Heart, try me and know my Tho'ts, and see if there be any wicked Way in me, and lead me in the Way everlasting.</HI> I desire to renounce all Confidence in the Flesh, to have my whole Dependance on the Satisfaction and Obedience of Christ for Pardon, Acceptance and Eternal Blessed∣ness. I take Him in all his <HI>Offices,</HI> as my <HI>Pro∣phet</HI> to teach, as my <HI>Priest</HI> to atone and inter∣ceed; and my <HI>King</HI> to rule me, and conquer my Enemies. 'Tis my sincere and constant Endeavour to lead a Life of holy Obedience unto his blessed Will, and to submit to all his righteous Dispensations. I firmly believe <HI>that all things shall work together for good to them that love God</HI>; and I hope I can truly say that <HI>I love Him.</HI> I am sure I can say, <HI>I desire to love Him with all my Heart.</HI> I bless God that I have experienc'd more outgoings of Soul to∣wards
<PB N="114" REF="003888_0124_100397D3BA62A7C0"/>
my Saviour (in his House and at his Table) to Day, and more of the divine Af∣flations comforting &amp; refreshing me than ever in my Life before. <HI>I return'd home fill'd with Joy and Praise.</HI> I think I could see my Inte∣rest in Christ, and the Father's reconciled Face shining on me. <HI>My Beloved is mine and I am his! All things are mine</HI>! O my God and Sa∣viour, let not this my Hope and Joy be that of the <HI>Hypocrite</HI> which shall perish; but that of the <HI>Righteous</HI> which abideth for ever.</Q></P>
<P>This was not the only Time she had <HI>Joy</HI> in believing.</P>
<P>At other Times she writes <Q>This Evening I was much enlarg'd in Prayer, and experienc'd much Comfort. I had some outgoings of Soul to my Saviour, and my Meditation on Him was sweet in my Bed. —</Q></P>
<P><Q>This Day I was much affected with God's Goodness to me thro' my whole Life. I hope I can truly say I love my <HI>Redeemer,</HI> that he is <HI>altogether lovely,</HI> and I prize him above ten thousand Worlds. I trust in none but Him. I have had <HI>a most ravishing Sight of Him!</HI> How wonderful is his Love! He has begun a good Work in me, and will carry it on to the End.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This Morning I hope I have had spiritual Communion with God, in &amp; thro' Jesus Christ. I have been greatly affected with his dying Love. I rest on Him alone for Salvation: I cast my trembling Soul upon him.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Last Night the Lord was pleased to give me (a most unworthy Creature) such a Taste of the Consolations of his Holy Spirit, as fill'd my Soul with Transports of Joy. And if but
<PB N="115" REF="003888_0125_100397DA722DA460"/>
a <HI>Taste</HI> of God's Love in Christ gives such Joy to a poor Soul on Earth, <HI>how do the Saints in Heaven feel?</HI> who constantly partake of <HI>Ful∣ness of Joys</HI> and Pleasures which flow <HI>at God's right Hand for evermore!</HI></Q></P>
<P N="5">(5.) Remarks on more <HI>publick Matters.</HI></P>
<P>In her Diary she takes Notice of God's Judg∣ments and Mercies to the <HI>Land,</HI> particularly his Visitations by <HI>Earthquakes, Thunders, Lightnings, Storms, Drought,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>She was among the <HI>Mourners in Zion</HI> for those provoking Evils which stirs up the Wrath of a righteous God &amp; Judge against a wicked People.</P>
<P>I find her also taking notice of God's Appear∣ing for the Land, granting <HI>Showers</HI> of Blessing in a time of Drought, <HI>July</HI> 3. 1728.</P>
<P>Some unhappy Affairs of <HI>Medford</HI> in the Years 1729 &amp; 30, produc'd many Prayers and Tears from her, with the following <HI>Poem</HI> in Imitation of the 133 <HI>Psalm,</HI> which I publish as a <HI>Monu∣ment</HI> for and <HI>Motive</HI> to my <HI>own People,</HI> to con∣tinue in <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<Q><L>BEhold how <HI>good,</HI> how <HI>sweet,</HI> their Joy does prove,</L>
<L>Where Brethren dwell in <HI>Unity</HI> and Love!</L>
<L>When no Contention, Strife, or fatal Jar</L>
<L>Disturb the Peace, and raise the noisy War.</L>
<L>'Tis like the <HI>Oyntment,</HI> which of old was pour'd</L>
<L>On <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Head, and down his Garments shower'd;</L>
<L>Thro' all the Air perfuming Odour spreads,</L>
<L>Diffusing Sweetness to the neighbouring Meads.</L>
<L>Or like the <HI>Dew</HI> on <HI>Hermon</HI>'s lofty Head</L>
<L>Which on the Mounts of <HI>Sion</HI> Moisture spread.</L>
<L>'Circled with <HI>Peace,</HI> they shall within the Land</L>
<L>As shining Patterns, and <HI>Examples</HI> stand.</L>
<L>If <HI>Sinners</HI> wrangle, let the <HI>Saints</HI> agree;</L>
<L>The <HI>Gospel</HI> breathes out nought but <HI>Unity.</HI></L>
<L>To such the Blessing from the Lord is given,</L>
<L>Even <HI>Life eternal,</HI> in the highest Heaven.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="116" REF="003888_0126_100397DC48C95FD8"/>Having related these Things, you will not wonder if I now declare my self a <HI>Witness</HI> of her daily close Walk with God during her mar∣ried State <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d of her Retirements for Reading, Self-Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ination and Devotion.</P>
<P>It was her Practice to read the <HI>Bible</HI> out in Course, once in a Year, the Book of <HI>Psalms</HI> much oftner, besides many <HI>Chapters</HI> and a Mul∣titude of <HI>Verses</HI> which she kept turn'd down in <HI>a Bible,</HI> which she had been the Owner and Reader of more than <HI>twenty</HI> Years. If I should only present my <HI>Readers</HI> with a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of these <HI>Texts,</HI> I doubt not but that they would ad∣mire the Collection, be gratified with the Enter∣tainment; and easily conjecture many of her holy Frames and Tempers from them. — I must own, considering her tender Make and of∣ten Infirmities she <HI>exceeded</HI> in Devotion. And I have tho't my self oblig'd sometimes (in Com∣passion to her) to call her off, and put her in mind of God's <HI>delighting in Mercy more than in Sacrifice.</HI></P>
<P>How often has she lain whole <HI>Nights</HI> by me mourning for Sin, calling upon God, and prai∣sing him, or discoursing of Christ and Heaven? And when under Doubts intreating me to help her (as far as I could) to a full Assurance of God's Love. Sometimes she would say, <Q>Well, I am content if you will shew me that I have the Truth of Grace.</Q> And I often satisfy'd her with one of Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>'s Marks of Love to Christ, namely, <HI>Lamenting &amp; panting after him</HI>; for this kind of Love she was sure she exercis'd in the most cloudy Hours of her Life.</P>
<P>I may not forget to mention <HI>the strong and constant Guard she plac'd at the Door of her Lips.</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="003888_0127_100397FA443B5408"/>
Who ever heard her call an ill Name? or <HI>detract</HI> from any Body? When she apprehended she receiv'd Injuries, <HI>Silence</HI> and <HI>Tears</HI> were her highest Resentments. But I have often heard her <HI>reprove</HI> others for rash and angry Speeches.</P>
<P>In every <HI>Relation</HI> she sustain'd she was truly <HI>Exemplary,</HI> sensible how much of the Life and Power of Religion consists in the conscientious Practice and Performance of <HI>Relative Duties.</HI></P>
<P>No <HI>Child</HI> had a greater Love to and Reve∣rence for her <HI>Parents,</HI> she even exceeded in Fear and Reverence of her <HI>Father,</HI> notwithstanding all his Condescentions to her, and vast Freedoms with her.</P>
<P>As a <HI>Wife</HI> she was dutiful, prudent and dili∣gent, not only content but joyful in her Cir∣cumstances. She <HI>submitted as is fit in the Lord, look'd well to the Ways of her Houshold, and her own Works praise her in the Gates.</HI></P>
<P>Her very Apparel discover'd Modesty and Chastity: She lov'd to appear neat and clean, but never gay and fine.</P>
<P>To her <HI>Servants</HI> she was good and kind, and took care of them, especially of the Soul of a <HI>Slave</HI> who dy'd (in the House) about a Month before her.</P>
<P>She respected all her <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Relatives,</HI> and spake of them with Honour, and never forgot either their Counsels or their Kindnesses.</P>
<P>She often spake of her Obligations to her <HI>Aunt Staniford,</HI> which were great living and dying.</P>
<P>She honour'd all Men, and lov'd every Body. <HI>Love and Goodness was natural to her,</HI> as her <HI>Father</HI> expresses it in a Letter Years ago.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="003888_0128_100397FBC7C29280"/>Her tender Love to her only <HI>Sister,</HI> has been already seen; and was on all Occasions manifest∣ed, and grew exceedingly to her Death. A few Days before it, I heard her speak to her particu∣larly of preparing for another World. <Q>Improve (said she) the Time of Health, 'tis the <HI>only</HI> Time for doing the great Work in.</Q></P>
<P>And in Return for her Love and amiable Carriage, <HI>She had the Love and Esteem of all that knew her.</HI> Those that knew her <HI>best</HI> lov'd her best, and praise her most.</P>
<P>Her <HI>Humility</HI> was so great, that she could well bear (without being elated) such <HI>Praises</HI> as are often found in her <HI>Father's</HI> Letters to us. viz. <Q>I greatly esteem as well as highly love you: The best of Children deserves all that a Child can of a Father: My Soul rejoyces in you: My Joy, my Crown. I give Thanks to God for you daily. I am honour'd in being the Father of such a Daughter.</Q></P>
<P>Her <HI>Husband</HI> also, and he <HI>praiseth</HI> her as a <HI>Meet Help</HI> both in Spirituals and Temporals.</P>
<P>Her <HI>Relations</HI> and Acquaintance ever mani∣fested the highest Value for her.</P>
<P>The <HI>People,</HI> among whom she liv'd the last <HI>eight</HI> Years of her Life, both <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>Young</HI> had a Love and <HI>Veneration</HI> for her; as a Person of the strictest Virtue and undefil'd Religion. Her <HI>Innocence, Modesty, Ingenuity,</HI> &amp; <HI>Devotion</HI> charm'd all into an Admiration of her. And I question whether there has been <HI>more Grief and Sorrow</HI> shown at the Death of any private Person, by People of all Ranks, to whom her Virtues were known; <HI>Mourning,</HI> for the Loss sustain'd by our
<PB N="119" REF="003888_0129_100398E5A89E6830"/>
selves, <HI>not for her,</HI> nor <HI>as others who have no Hope.</HI> For it is beyond Doubt that she <HI>died in the Lord,</HI> and is <HI>Blessed.</HI></P>
<P>The Death of every such <HI>praying Saint</HI> is a Frown upon the whole Land, and calls upon us to make that Prayer, Psal. xii. 1, <HI>Help Lord for the Godly cease, and the Faithful fail from among the Children of Men.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADDENDA. Concerning her last Sickness and Death.</HEAD>
<P>HER <HI>Illness</HI> began with <HI>violent Symptoms,</HI> such as Opressions at the Breast &amp; in the Bowels, which held three or more Hours in the Night Season; under which she cry'd to God <HI>that Pa∣tience might have its perfect Work, and that her Faith might not fail.</HI>— After some Time it chang'd, and put on various Forms, as is common in <HI>Hysterick Cases.</HI> For some Days her Complaints were chiefly of <HI>Faintness</HI> and Sinking of the Spi∣rits, in the <HI>Proxysms</HI> whereof she often tho't her self a dying, <HI>and would graciously resign her self, hoping it would be well with her.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Fear</HI> overcame her, and she was ready to despond, she would check her self and say, <HI>This is Nature, and Grace cannot wholly conquer it.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>Saturday</HI> Night before she dy'd she lay under the most wracking Pains in her Back, Shoulders &amp;c. and in the Morning fell into a Degree of <HI>Stupor,</HI> which bro't on <HI>Fits</HI> by <HI>Mon∣day</HI> Afternoon.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tuesday</HI> Night she caus'd me to be several Times awak'd by the <HI>Watcher,</HI> to discourse▪ of
<PB N="120" REF="003888_0130_100398E72ACC7390"/>
Spiritual and Eternal Things, and to bring Pro∣mises and Comforts to her Mind.</P>
<P>She had her <HI>lucid Intervals</HI> all along, which she improv'd in lifting up her Voice and Soul in most pious and pertinent Ejaculations.</P>
<P>The last Day of her Life (which was <HI>Wednes∣day</HI>) her <HI>Frame</HI> was proper to meet <HI>Death</HI> in, so long as she could be kept awake; and spake often of <HI>its Approaching</HI>; especially in the Even∣ing. When I spake of praying, she desir'd me to be <HI>short and sweet,</HI> for she could not be long intent.</P>
<P>Her <HI>last</HI> Words, were, <HI>'Thou hast deliver'd, thou dost deliver, and I trust in Thee that thou wilt still deliver.</HI>— And <HI>Death</HI> is the <HI>Deliverance</HI> of those that live as she did.</P>
<P>Between the Hours of <HI>Eleven</HI> and <HI>Twelve</HI> (after she had struggled with two or three vio∣lent Fits) we apprehended her Change would quickly come on. I therefore stood up and <HI>Pray'd over her,</HI> with her Friends; and in the midst of our <HI>Resignations</HI> of her, and <HI>commend∣ing her Spirit into the Hands of her Redeemer</HI> (without any Groan or Motion) she <HI>fell asleep in Jesus,</HI> and is gone to <HI>everlasting Rest and Joy. The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, and Blessed be the Name of the Lord.</HI></P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Reader</HI> will easily observe, thro' the preceeding <HI>Memoirs,</HI> the great Advantage Mrs. <HI>Turell</HI> had in the early Care of her <HI>Father</HI> to infuse Knowlege of the best Kind, in the easiest and kindest Manner, into her little Mind, as fast as it grew capable of receiving it. He first <HI>talk'd</HI> into her all he cou'd in the most free and endearing Manner, and then supply'd her with the best <HI>Books</HI> of every kind, suted to her Years and Inclinations, without making them a <HI>Task</HI> and Burthen; which it must be own'd was very much owing to her natural <HI>Genius</HI> and Inclination. His next Care was to teach her to <HI>read his Hand,</HI> and then by <HI>writing to her,</HI> in a Manner becoming him and proper for her, he insinuated himself more and more into her Affections, and increas'd her Reverence of Him, and Desire of his Esteem. The Way to merit and obtain that, he let her see was by a prudent, hum∣ble, virtuous and religious Conduct, upon the Principles and Motives of <HI>Christianity,</HI> the Fear of <HI>GOD</HI> and a Desire to please her <HI>Heavenly Father.</HI> The Success and Fruit of these happy <HI>Methods</HI> have been partly seen in the foregoing <HI>Nar∣rative</HI>; and tho' it can't be pretended that the like Endea∣vours will always be attended with like Success, yet it may be supposed they would very often, if <HI>Parents,</HI> with a humble Reliance on the Blessing of God, and Prayers for it, would go into them.</P>
<P><HI>Ministers</HI> especially have great Advantages herefor, and are under special Obligations to be <HI>Examples</HI> to their Flocks, in this <HI>Rule</HI> of their own House.

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU were wishing last Night that I would instruct you how to write <HI>Letters,</HI> which I willingly undertake to do by <HI>writing</HI> to You, and requiring you to <HI>answer</HI> me as often as I write. I know no Way of teaching you so easy and pleasant to me, and that may be so profitable to you. I hope it will be a very great Pleasure to you to hear from <HI>your Fa∣ther</HI> often this Way, and to speak to him again, and to have his loving Lines to you to read over again and again at your Leisure. Besides, Your <HI>lisping</HI> at good Sense will be as <HI>Music</HI> to your Father's Ear, and much more your <HI>Growth</HI> the Joy of his Soul.</P>
<P>You need not be asham'd to let your Father see your Ig∣norances and <HI>Defects,</HI> for to be sure he'll kindly <HI>cover</HI> 'em, as well as <HI>inform</HI> you of 'em.</P>
<P>A very little <HI>Use</HI> will make you Mistress eno' of the Art of decent, familiar, common Letters. <HI>Practice</HI> is the best and shortest Way of learning this; and it will be well worth a little <HI>Pains</HI> to learn, being of constant <HI>Use</HI> while you live, and not one of the least <HI>Ornaments</HI> and Pleasures of Life.</P>
<P>Write without Fear or Awe to <HI>Him</HI> who is your own, and whose you are. Write more or less according as you find your Tho'ts flowing or restrained. But always remember, that it is better to be <HI>short</HI> and full of good Sense, than to <HI>draw out</HI> your Letters to an empty Length.</P>
<P>Mine to you will be on one Head or other of Religious and Virtuous <HI>Conduct,</HI> wherein I shall teach you the Fear of the <HI>Lord</HI> and the Care of your own <HI>Soul,</HI> which are the true and highest <HI>Wisdom.</HI> I shall breathe hereby into your Ear, and may it please God into your Heart, many a good <HI>Wish</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> for you to make over again for your Self. And may you find Grace from <HI>God,</HI> to make this Benefit of that tender Affection, which fills the Soul of your <HI>loving Father</HI> ——</P>

<P>YOU have much honour'd and endear'd your Self to me by <HI>your Letter</HI> Yesterday. You have answer'd all my Hopes, and out-done my Expectations. I see you are a

<P>There is but one Word amiss in your Letter, besides a false Spell or two, and that is the Word <HI>Fortune.</HI> The <HI>Hea∣thens</HI> made a <HI>Goddess</HI> of the blind Nothing, and ignorantly Worship'd it. The <HI>Philistines,</HI> as you read in your <HI>Bible,</HI> speak of <HI>Chance.</HI> But <HI>Christians</HI> have learn'd the Doctrine of a <HI>glorious Providence</HI> that governs and orders those things which Men call <HI>casual.</HI></P>
<P>You are sorry, you say, "that you have so <HI>little</HI> of your <HI>Father</HI>'s Soul in you", and I am well pleas'd you have so <HI>much</HI> of it; but I hope God will make your's <HI>better</HI> than your Father's.</P>
<P>God give you your <HI>Petition,</HI> that as you grow in <HI>Years,</HI> you may in <HI>Grace.</HI> And be sure that you pray for your <HI>Father, Mother</HI> and <HI>Sister,</HI> when you do for your own Soul.</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOur Letter of the 9th. of this <HI>Month</HI> was exceeding pleasant to Me and to your Mother, wherein you ex∣press your great Contentment in the kind Disposals of Provi∣dence respecting you. No worldly thing can rejoyce us more than your Happiness in Mr. <HI>Turell,</HI> and his in you. You will emulate his tender Regards to you and his incompara∣ble good Temper; and learning of him return the same to him, that he may have as rich a Blessing in You, as you have in Him. O the Happiness, when <HI>two Souls</HI> meet in the Marriage Relation, that are suited to each other, and mu∣tually strive which shall be most obliging and endearing!</P>
<P>But my <HI>Dear,</HI> let all this draw you to <HI>Christ,</HI> in Love, Gra∣titude and Devotedness to Him. Mr. <HI>Turell</HI> will direct you in renewing your Espousals to <HI>Christ</HI> at his <HI>Table.</HI> Delay not this Duty, but joyn your Self to that Church and People of <HI>God,</HI> who (you say) are so full of Good-will and Love to you.

<SALUTE>My Dear Child,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your's to me of this Week you ask my Tho'ts about that <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Page 52, &amp; 111.</NOTE> Text, 1 Cor. 11.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 29. <HI>Whosoever shall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord; he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's Body.</HI></P>
<P>You say that it comforted you to find Mr. <HI>Flavel</HI> saying, <Q>That by <HI>Damnation</HI> here is not meant eternal Condemna∣tion, but some temporal Judgment and Chastisement in order to the preventing the eternal Damnation.</Q>—This is no more than what you have often heard from me and other Ministers.</P>
<P>It is certain that the <HI>Greek Word</HI> render'd here <HI>Damnation,</HI> signifies only <HI>Judgment</HI> in general, as the <HI>Margin</HI> of our Bibles renders it. And this Judgment is primarily meant of <HI>temporal</HI> Judgments; as it immediately follows, ver. 30, 31.32. <HI>For this Cause many an weak and sickly among you, and many sleep; for if we would judge our selves, we should not be judged: But when we are judged, we are chastned of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the World.</HI></P>
<P>Here, my Dear, you have Mr. <HI>Flavel's</HI> Interpretation in the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s own Words: Scil, that <HI>temporal Judgment and Chastisement is the primary Meaning of that Text,</HI> and this <HI>in order to the preventing eternal Damnation.</HI></P>
<P>But if you look into the <HI>Context,</HI> you will easily see how <HI>gross and soul</HI> the unworthy Eating among the <HI>Corinthians</HI> was. They acted after such a manner that the Apostle told them ver. 20. <HI>That it was not to eat the Lord's Supper.</HI> They
<PB N="125" REF="003888_0135_100398F47B76CF10"/>
did not <HI>discern the Lord's Body.</HI> They made a kind of <HI>common Meal</HI> of it. The Abuse of their <HI>Love-Feasts,</HI> us'd before the Sacrament among them, was the Occasion hereof. The poor were neglected, every one <HI>took his own Supper; one was hungry and another was drunken</HI>! ver. 21. <HI>What,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>Have ye not Houses to eat and drink in? or despise ye the Church of God</HI>? ver. 22. Here was gross Disorder indeed, even to In∣temperance; such as is not like to be known among us. Wherefore, neither are the like temporal Judgments known among us on this Account, as were inflicted upon those <HI>Corinthians.</HI></P>
<P>But if People do incur the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God by <HI>unsuitable partaking</HI> at the Lord's Table, Do they not equally by a <HI>careless Omission</HI> and irreverent and prophane <HI>Neglect</HI> of it, think you? Is not the <HI>Reason</HI> the same? the <HI>Irreligion</HI> and Provo∣cation the same? And so may the <HI>Danger</HI> be justly appre∣hended.</P>
<P>Indeed either the <HI>"Omission or careless Performance</HI> of the holy Duties of God's Worship, secret or publick, do justly expose People to the Judgments of God, both bodily and spiritual, temporal and eternal. And the <HI>spiritual</HI> Judgments we should especially fear. And if People habitually and pro∣fanely and impenitently <HI>stay away</HI> from the Lord's Table, or <HI>come</HI> to it; both the one and the other will turn to their <HI>Damnation</HI> in the World to come.</P>
<P>But what is the Inference or <HI>Argument</HI> from hence? Is it not that therefore we should religiously <HI>prepare</HI> for, and re∣verently <HI>come</HI> to the Ordinances of Christ? We must nei∣ther <HI>stay away</HI> from them, nor <HI>prophane</HI> them in the Use of them; for <HI>both</HI> of these Errors will alike incur the Judgment of God, here and hereafter, without Repentance</P>
<P>And think my <HI>Dear,</HI> Is it only by <HI>Eating</HI> and <HI>Drinking un∣worthily,</HI> that the Judgment of God is incurred? Is it not also by <HI>unworthy Praying</HI>? For it is said, That the <HI>Prayer</HI> of the wicked is an <HI>Abomination</HI> to the Lord. Is not <HI>this</HI> as dreadful as the Word <HI>Judgment</HI>? And do we not read of the <HI>Word Preached,</HI> that it will become a <HI>Savour of Death unto Death</HI> by our <HI>unworthy hearing</HI> it? Here is <HI>eternal</HI> Dam∣nation indeed in these fearful words, <HI>Death unto Death.</HI> Let us fear then to <HI>pray</HI> and <HI>hear</HI> unworthily, as well as to <HI>eat</HI> unworthily. But to be sure we may <HI>not</HI> say, "Well then, it is best <HI>not</HI> to pray at all, and best <HI>not</HI> to hear at all, lest I bring Judgment and Condemnation upon my self: No more should we say—I will <HI>not</HI> dare to go to the Lord's Table for the same Reason.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="003888_0136_100398FAA17E6AC8"/>In a word, If we prophane the <HI>Sabbaths</HI> and <HI>Ordinances</HI> of Christ, it will be to our Judgment, both on temporal and spiritual Accounts; and they will be prophaned by us, if they are not reverently observed by us. The Rule there∣fore is, ver. 28. <HI>Let a Man examine himself, and so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup.</HI> So let a Man <HI>examine</HI> himself, and prepare for the <HI>other</HI> Ordinances of Christ. <HI>Keep thy foot when thou goest to the House of God, and offer not the Sacrifice of Fools who consider not that they do Evil.</HI> Be so∣lemn, serious, and reverend in the <HI>whole</HI> worship of God, for it is all <HI>holy,</HI> and God will be <HI>sanctifyed</HI> in it by us, or will sanctify himself upon us.</P>
<P>You have Mr. <HI>Pool</HI> and Mr. <HI>Burkit</HI>; see what <HI>they</HI> say upon the Place. Read also and weigh well the 41, 42, 43 <HI>Pages</HI> of Mr. <HI>Henry's Communicant</HI>'s <HI>Companion,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In our <HI>Boston</HI> Edition.</NOTE> there you will find a good <HI>Answer</HI> to all the rest of your Letter to me.</P>
<P>It is uncertain when I shall see you, but <HI>God</HI> will I trust be with you, and your Heart toward him. We all send you our Loves, and I am</P>

<SALUTE>My Dear,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Face of the Sky this Morning, begins to forbid me the Pleasure of seeing you to Morrow. I would not have you expect me, nor that Mr. <HI>Turell</HI> should have the least Dependance on me. I hope God will be with you in your <HI>open Giving your self</HI> to Him. The great thing lies <HI>in Secret,</HI> between God and your own Soul. The publick joyn∣ing your self to the <HI>Church</HI> is but the doing that before Men, which you have first done before God in secret. <HI>With the Heart Man believeth unto Righteousness, and with the Mouth Confession is made unto Salvation.</HI> If you should feel some Flutter and <HI>Disorder</HI> of Mind in public, let not that discour∣age you: The Self-dedication was done <HI>sedately</HI> in secret. Yet I pray God to give you much <HI>Comfort,</HI> and the Tokens of his Grace and Presence in the publick Transaction. And may you live long to serve God, and enjoy much of God in your Closet and also in his House, on <HI>Lord's-days</HI> and other Days; and be a Blessing in your Place, both to Mr. <HI>Turell</HI> and to the People among whom your Lot is cast.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="003888_0137_100398FC24CA84A0"/>Go on then, my dear <HI>Child,</HI> in the Fear and Love of <HI>God,</HI> and in the Strength and Righteousness of <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>joyn your self unto the Lord, in an everlasting Covenant, never to be forgot∣ten.</HI> Jer. I. 5. See <HI>there</HI> the Frame, and Voice, and Act of a Soul preparing, or thro' Grace prepared, for the renewing and confirming its <HI>Covenant</HI> with God. Both the <HI>Duty</HI> and the <HI>Grace</HI> of the Covenant are wonderfully expressed in this <HI>Phrase.</HI> A Word of wonderful <HI>Condescention</HI> on the part of <HI>God,</HI> and of strong <HI>Obligation</HI> and Binding on <HI>ours.</HI></P>
<P>For in Covenanting with God we <HI>joyn our selves</HI> to Him, as <HI>Servants to their Master</HI> by an Indenture; as <HI>Subjects to their King</HI> by an Oath of Allegiance; as <HI>Soldiers to their General</HI> in a War against Sin and Satan; and as a <HI>Wife to her Husband</HI> in a Marriage Covenant; a <HI>Covenant</HI> of mutual, endearing, constant and perpetual <HI>Love.</HI>—O with what a consenting joyful Soul, should you now (my Dearest, my Joy and my Crown!) make your <HI>Vows</HI> to God! Let <HI>the Love of Christ constrain thee.</HI> Say, <Q>I will go unto the Altar of God, unto God my exceeding Joy! I will take the Cup of Salvation and call upon the Name of the Lord! I will pay my Vows unto the Lord, now in the Presence of all his People.</Q> O what a <HI>Mercy,</HI> and Matter of everlasting Thanksgiving, is a <HI>Heart</HI> thus given to <HI>Christ!</HI></P>
<P>And remember, that what you do is <HI>for Perpetuity,</HI> never to be forgotten. We Covenant for Life and for <HI>Eternity.</HI> It is the Covenant of the <HI>Living God,</HI> with <HI>Immortal</HI> Creatures, for our whole Being here, and for our eternal Well being in another World. We must reverently use the <HI>Signs &amp; Seals</HI> of the Covenant of our God, to keep in Memory our <HI>Bonds</HI> and God's <HI>Promises.</HI></P>
<P>This is a Sketch of the <HI>Sermon</HI> I might have brought you, had my Health and the Weather permitted me. It may lie by you, be reviewed on Occasion, and do you more good, than if I had come and preach'd to you. <HI>Grace be with you.</HI> Amen.</P>

<P>I Know your <HI>tender</HI> Heart, and am much concerned for you upon <HI>the Death of your Servant.</HI> It comes near to you, as Deaths in our <HI>Families</HI> always should.
