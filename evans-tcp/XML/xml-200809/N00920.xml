<HEAD>A short DIALOGUE between a Divine and a Beggar.</HEAD>
<P>A Certain Divine, who (if we may believe the ancient copy) was <HI>John Tanlerus</HI> himself, meeting with a Beggar, had this Discourse, containing a most excellent Example <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> perfect man; whence we may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taught how in all things we ought to be of the same mind, resigned to the will and appointment of God.</P>
<P>There was in times past, a certain famous Divine, who for the space of eight years had continually impor∣tuned the Lord by Prayer, conceiving he wanted the right knowledge o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Truth,</HI> notwithstanding all his Learning; and spent whole night<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="67" REF="001101_0067_0FB03DC3C974F1B8"/>
therein; begging of God to let him know Him, and know himself, &amp; to shew him any man that might teach him the way of <HI>Truth</HI>: and when upon a time he was enflamed with a vehement desire thereof, a Voice from Heaven spake unto him, <HI>Go forth to the Church-doors, &amp; there thou shalt find a man that can shew thee the way of Truth:</HI> and going forth, he found there a certain Beggar, with patcht and torn apparrel, and filth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dirty feet, all whose apparrel was scarcely worth <HI>Three-half-pence,</HI> to whom, by way of Salutation, he thus spake:</P>

<P>Truly Sir, I will do it willing∣ly; Thou didst wish me a good morning, and I answered, I never had an evil one: for when I am pin∣ched with hunger, <HI>I praise God,</HI> if I suffer cold, if it hail, if it snow, if it rain; if the weather be fair or foul▪ <HI>I praise God</HI>: if I be wretched and despised, <HI>I likewise praise God</HI>: and therefore there never happened a∣ny sad or evil morning to me.

<PB N="69" REF="001101_0069_0FB03DC5EC18F890"/>
whatever happened to me, whether it were agreeable to me, or other∣wise, were it sweet or bitter, I glad∣ly received it at his hands as the best, and therefore I was never un∣fortunate. Thou saidst moreover, that God would be pleased to make me happy; whereunto I answered that I never had been unhappy: for I am fully resolved thro' his Grace, to adhere and only to cleave to the Will of God as the best, (abandon∣ing my own will) into which I have so wholly poured out my own will, that whatever He Wills, I will also: and for this cause as I said, I was never unhappy, seeing that I will cleave to His Will only, and have wholly resigned my own proper will.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Div.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>This is very strange: But what, I pray thee wouldst thou say, if the Lord Almighty should Drown thee

<P>Drown me in the bottomless Pit! Why certainly if He should, I have two arms, with which I would still embrace him &amp; clasp fast about him: The one is true Humility, &amp; that I lay under Him, &amp; by him I am united to His most sacred Humani∣ty; the other (&amp; that is the right arm) is Love, which is united to His Divinity, &amp; by this love given to me from himself, I hold him so fast, that He would be forced to go down to Hell mith me, &amp; it were much more to be wished by me, to be in Hell with God, than to be in Heaven without Him.</P>
<P>By this that Divine learned, that the most compendious way to God is a true Resignation with profound Humility. Hereupon the Divine spake

<HEAD>Cordial MEDITATIONS for CHRISTIANS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WHat unthankfulness is this, to think so much upon two or three Crosses, and to forget an hundred Blessings? What folly is it to darken &amp; straiten our spirits, &amp; indispose our selves to the taking or doing of good? (2) A limb out of joynt can do nothing without deformity and pain. Dejection takes off the wheels of the Soul joy is as Oyl to the Soul, it makes duties come off chearfully from o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> selves, pleasingly to others, and acceptably to GOD. 3.) Let us go on to add Grace to Grace. A growing Christi∣an is always a comfortable Christi∣an.
<PB N="76" REF="001101_0076_0FB03DCCC2062488"/>
The Oyl of Grace will bring forth the Oyl of Gladness. (4.) Me∣lancholly persons are in a perpetual darkness; all things seem black and dark unto them; their Souls are as it were died black; whatsoever comes to a melancholick person, comes in a dark way to the Soul. (5.) In all grievances, let us look to something that may comfort us as well as discourage us▪ let us look as well to what we enjoy as to wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> we want. As in Prosperity God mingles some Cross to diet us, so in all Crosses there is something to C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mfort us. As there is a Vanity lies hid in the greatest worldly good, so there is a Blessing lies hid in the greatest worldly Evil Is not our Health more than Sickness? Do not we enjoy more than we want{reversed ?} (I mean of necessary things) Are not

our good dayes more than our evil But we would go to Heaven upon Roses. (6.) We must neither bring sin to, nor mingle sin with our suf∣ferings, for that will trouble the spi∣rit more than the trouble it self. We are not hurt till our Souls be hurt. (7.) In sudden encounters, some sin doth many times discover it self, the seed whereof lyeth hid in our hearts, which we think our selves free from. What cause have we then to fear continually that we are worse than we take our selves to be? The force of Gun-powder is not known till some sparks light on it. (8.) What a sight were it to see the feet where the head is, or the earth where the heaven is? And to a spiritual eye, it seems as great a deformity, to see the Soul to be un∣der the rule of sinful passions. (9.)

A good heart, when any Corruption is discovered by a searching Minist∣ry, is affected as if it found out some deadly Enemy▪ Touchiness &amp; Pas∣sion argues guilt (10.) The imagi∣nary grievances of this life are more than the real. (11.) The way to expel wind out of your Body, is to take wholesome nourishment; so to expel windy fancies from the Soul▪ is to feed upon serious truths; our best way therefore, is to propound true objects to the mind, to work upon, As 1st. <HI>To consider the great∣ness and goodness of God.</HI> 2ndly. <HI>The joyes of Heaven &amp; the torments of Hell.</HI> 3rdly. <HI>The last and strict Day of Ac∣count.</HI> 4thly. <HI>The vanity of Earthly Things.</HI> 5thly. <HI>The uncertainty of our Lives.</HI> (12.) A man naturally is either weaving Spiders webbs, or hatching Cockatrices eggs; exercised either
<PB N="79" REF="001101_0079_0FB03DCFA5BCEF38"/>
in vanity or mischief. (13.) It would much avail to the well ordering of our thoughts, to set our Souls in or∣der every morning, &amp; to strengthen and perfume our spirits with some gracious Meditations, especially of the chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nd &amp; scope wherefore we live; and how every thing we do, or befal us, may be reduced and or∣dered to further the main, <HI>viz.</HI> Gods Glory, and our own Salvation. (14) Some will be contented to embrace Truth without hatred of the world; &amp; Christ without a Cross; a Godly life without Persecution: they will pull a Rose without Pricks: such empty conceits will be too weak to encou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter real griefs. (15.) It is a course that will have a blessing at∣tending it, to joyn in a league one to watch over another, &amp; to observe each others wayes; it is usual to
<PB N="80" REF="001101_0080_0FB03DD4B1DDC328"/>
joyn in Prayer, why not in this? (16.) Happy is he that in his way to heaven meets with a chearful &amp; skilful Guide and Fellow-traveller, that carrieth Cordials with him a∣gainst all faintings of spirit. (17.) There is an heavy imputation on them that comforted not the weak: when men will not own others in trouble, but as the herd of Deer for∣sake and push away the wounded from them. (18.) God often sus∣pends comfort from us, to make use of our Christian Friends, by whom he purposeth to do us good: often∣times the very opening of mens griefs, bringeth ease, without any further working upon them: The very opening of a vein cooleth the blood. (19.) A Christian when he is heaten out of all other comforts, yet hath a God to run unto, &amp; he

can wrestle with him in his own strength, and plead with him with his own arguments. (20.) Tis a ne∣ver failing rule of discerning a man to be in the state of Grace, when he finds every condition draws him nearer to God. (21.) Labour to answer every Relation wherein thou, standest to God. 1st▪ <HI>As a Father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> trusting on His care.</HI> 2ndly. <HI>A Teach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng His direction.</HI> 3rdly▪ <HI>As a Creator, by depending on Him▪</HI> 4thly. <HI>As a Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>band, by insepara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> affectionate love to Him.</HI> And lastly, <HI>As a Lord by obedience to Him.</HI> (22.) Despair is often the ground of Hope: when the darkness of the night is, thickest, then the morning begins to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn▪ (23.) We may safely expect God in his ways of Mercy, when we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in his wayes of Obedience (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.) By trusting any thing more
<PB N="82" REF="001101_0082_0FB03DD72BB71DC8"/>
than God, we make it an idol and a curse: it will prove a lying vanity and vexation, bringing that upon us which we looked not for. (25.) Its a vain pretence to think, that God will give us <HI>Heaven,</HI> and yet leave us to shift for our selves by the way. (26) The way to have any thing taken away and not bles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, is to set our hearts too much upon it. (27.) The greatest honour we can do God, is when we see nothing for us, but rather all things contra∣ry to what we look for, then to shut our eyes to all inferiour things, and to look altogether to his All-suffici∣ency. (28) Its an evidence of true trust, when we can wait Gods leisure. and not make hast. (29.) Faith doth no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, especially at first, so stay the Soul, as to take away all suspi∣cion and fear to the contrary: yet
<PB N="83" REF="001101_0083_0FB03DD7E1395F00"/>
the prevailing of unbelief is taken away. The Needle in the Compass will stand <HI>North,</HI> though with some trembling; and the Ship that rides at anchor may sometimes be tossed, yet it commonly remains so fast, that it cannot be carried away by a∣ny weather. (30.) Look not on so much on those miseries which our weak Natures are subject unto, at upon God for strength and comfort in them, mitigation of them, and Grace to profit by them (31.) The time of sickness, is the time of pur∣ging from the defilements of sin, which we have gathered in our health, till we come purer our; which should make us the rather willingly to abide Gods time.

God defers, but in his deferring there is no empty space, wherein no good is done: but there is in that space a fitting for mercy. (39.) It is folly to think that we should have Physick &amp; Health both at once; Gods time is the best time, resolve therefore upon waiting His leisure. After a weary week, comes a <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and after a fight comes <HI>Victory.</HI> (40.) Unkindness of others
<PB N="86" REF="001101_0086_0FB03DDAE5835908"/>
to us, is but a correction of our un∣kindness to God. (41.) He that can∣not abound without Pride &amp; High-mindedness, will never want with∣out too much dejectedness. (42.) Let us not seek our selves abroad out of our selves, in the conceits of other men. A man shall never live quietly, that hath not learned to set light by others cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lless ill conceit of him. (43.) Men that set too high a price upon themselves, when men will not come up to their price, they are discontented. (44.) Those whose condition is above their worth, and their pride above their condition, shall never want sorrow; yet we must maintain our Authority in our places, for that is Gods, &amp; not ours and we ought to carry our selves so as we may approve our selves to their Consciences, though we can∣not
<PB N="87" REF="001101_0087_0FB03DDBCA7BBF10"/>
have their good word. (45.) One end why God suffers the Soul to tire and beat it self, is, that finding no rest in it self, it might seek to God. (46) A man can be in no conditi∣on wherein God is at a loss; if com∣forts be wanting, He can Create comforts, not only out of nothing, but even out of discomfort. He made the Whale which swallowed <HI>Jonas,</HI> a means to bring him to land. (47.) The only way to have our will, is to bring it to Gods Will. (48.) The way patiently to suffer Gods will, is to inure our selves to do it; they that have not inur'd themselves to the yoak of Obedience, will never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndurs the yoak of Suffering. (49.) When we can say to God, if thou wilt have me poor and disgraced, I am well content; thus a Godly man sayes, <HI>Amen</HI> to Gods <HI>Amen,</HI> &amp; puts
<PB N="88" REF="001101_0088_0FB03DDEF8362AD0"/>
his <HI>Fiat</HI> to Gods <HI>Fiat.</HI> (50.) None feel more experience of Gods Provi∣dence, than those that are most re∣solute in their Obedience. (51.) After we have given Glory to God, by relying upon his Wisdom, Power, and Truth, we shall find Him im∣ploying these for our direction, as∣sistance, and bringing things about to our desired issue; yea, above what we desired or thought of. (52.) The more passion, the less discretion, be∣cause passion hinders the sight of what is to be done, it clouds the Soul, and puts it on without advise∣ment. (53.) It is good to observe the particular becks of Providence▪ how things joyn &amp; meet together fit occasions, and suiting of things are intimations of Gods will. Provi∣dence hath a language which is we understood by those that have a fa∣miliar

acquaintance with God: They see a train of Providence leading one way more than another. (54.) Labour to fit a promise to every con∣dition thou art in: there is no con∣dition but hath a Promise suitable to it. (55.) He that loveth too much will grieve too much: It is the great∣ness of our affection that causeth the greatness of our affliction. (56.) All our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> within proceeds from a discontented swelling vapour of Pride: Its air inclosed in the bowels of the earth that shakes it, which all the four winds cannot do. (57.) There is an art of bearing troubles (if we could learn it) without o∣ver troubling our selves: as in bear∣ing a burden there is a way to poize it, that it weigheth not over heavy, if it hangeth all on one side, it poi∣zes the body down: the greatest
<PB N="90" REF="001101_0090_0FB03DE045E80DF0"/>
part of our troubles we pull on our selves, by not parting our care, so as to take upon us onely the care of Duty, and leave the rest to God. (58.) We must not mingle our pas∣sions with our crosses, like foolish Pa∣tients, chewing the Pills we should swallow down. (59.) He that sees not God every where, sees him no where. (60.) He that loseth him∣self in self-denial, finds himself in the bosome of God. (61.) In Prosperi∣ty fear God, in Adversity love God. [62.] Praying will make thee leave Sinning, or sinning will make thee leave Praying. [63.] Our weakness and inabilities, break not the bond of our duties. [64.] No sin but is easier kept out, than cast out. [65.] What we are afraid to do before men, we should be afraid to think before God. [66.] Nature vexed &amp;
