<P>A STATE OF THE IMPORTATIONS FROM GREAT-BRITAIN Into the Port of BOSTON, From the beginning of Jan. 1769, to Aug. 17th 1769.</P>
<P>With the Advertisements of a Set of Men who assumed to themselves the TITLE of "ALL THE WELL DISPOSED MERCHANTS," Who entered into a SOLEMN AGREEMENT, (as they called it) Not to import GOODS from Britain, and who undertook to give a "TRUE ACCOUNT" of what should be imported by other Persons.</P>

<P><HI>IT may be necessary to inform the</HI> Public, <HI>that the reason for beginning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> publications, were some Votes passed at a meeting of the</HI> Well Dispos∣ed, <HI>Friday</HI> August 11th, 1769, <HI>which were printed in the</HI> Boston Gazette, <HI>and</HI> Boston Evening Post <HI>of Monday,</HI> August 14th, <HI>and the</HI> Massachusetts Gazette <HI>of</HI> August 17th, <HI>in one of which Votes, my name was inserted; for this piece,</HI> see Pages 2, 3. in this collection, <HI>which occa∣sioned the</HI> Reply <HI>that immediately follows it, dated</HI> August 17th. <HI>The animadversions which accompanied the several Manifests, were published in answer to the gross abuse thrown out by the</HI> "Well Disposed;" <HI>for when they found they were detected, not daring to argue, they were very lavish of scurrillity. The</HI> "Well Disposed" <HI>were likewise at the greatest pains to prejudice me in my several branches of business, as</HI> Bookseller, Sta∣tioner, Bookbinder <HI>and</HI> Printer, <HI>by sending to the Select-men of every Town in the</HI> Province, <HI>as they mentioned at one of their Meetings, not to deal with me; and also, by applying particularly to the persons who dealt with me both in town and country. In the course of the following papers, I have not considered the affair of</HI> Non-Importation <HI>in a political light, it has only been my business to show the partiality and malice of the</HI> "Well Disposed" <HI>against me, some of their Importations being</HI> Fifty times <HI>the value of mine, and to show, that however ready they were to enter into a solemn agreement, they were as ready to forget they had signed such an agreement.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Copy of the agreement entered into by the Merchants and Traders, August 1768.</HEAD>
<P>THE merchants and traders in the town of Boston having taken into consideration the deplorable situation of the trade, and the ma∣ny difficulties it at present labours under, on account of the scarcity of money, which is dai∣ly increasing for want of the other remittan∣ces to discharge our debt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in Great-Britain, and the large sums collected by the officers of the customs for duties on goods imported; the hea∣vy taxes levied to discharge the debts contract∣ed by the government in the late war; the trade by several late acts of parliament; to∣gether with the bad success of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od fishery this season, and the discouraging prospect of the whale fishery, by which our principal sources of remittance are like to be greatly di∣minished, and we thereby rendered unable to pay the debts we owe the merchants in Great-Britain, and to continue the importati∣on of goods from thence.</P>
<P>We the subscribers in order to relieve the trade under those discouragements, to pro∣mote industry, frugality and oeconomy, and to discourage luxury, and every kind of extrava∣gance, do promise and engage to and with each other as follows▪</P>
<P>First, <HI>That we will not send for or import from Great-Britain, either upon our own account, or up∣on commission, this fall, any other goods than what are already ordered for the fall supply.</HI></P>

<P>Fourthly, <HI>That we will not import, on our own account, or on commission, or purchase of any who shall import from any other Colony in America, from January</HI> 1769, <HI>to Jan.</HI> 1770, <HI>any Tea, Glass, Paper, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> other goods commonly imported from Gr.

<P>In witness whereof, we have hereunto set our hands, this first day of August, 1768.</P>

<P><HI>[In consequence of which Notification,]</HI></P>
<P>The merchants and traders of this town, met on Friday last, and appointed a commit∣tee consisting of seven gentlemen, to examine the manifests of the cargoes of the vessels late∣ly arrived or that may arrive this spring from any parts of Great-Britain, and to take such other steps as they may think necessary to de∣termine, whether there have been any goods imported contrary to the late agreement of the merchants, and by whom, and report at the adjournment of this meeting. And also, to make enquiry, whether any goods contra∣ry
<PB N="2" REF="011336_0004_0F8580B45BA4B8A0"/>
to said agreement have been imported from the other colonies, and by whom, and to make report of the same also at the adjourn∣ment.—The merchants meeting stands ad∣journed to Thursday the 27th instant.</P>
<P>THE Merchants and Traders in the Town of BOSTON, at a Meeting in August last, having entered into an agreement not to send for, or import any goods from Great-Britain nor to purchase any that should be imported from thence, or from any of the Colonies, from January 1769, to January 1770, and si∣miliar agreements having been come into by the Merchants and Traders in other towns in this province, and at New-York:—The ad∣hering to which being strongly recommend∣ed by our friends in Great-Britain, as the most likely method to obtain a redress of the difficulties that trade labours under, and a number of vessels having lately arrived from Great-Britain, it was thought advisable to call another meeting of the Merchants▪ which was held at Faneuil Hall, the 21st ult<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> when a Committee was chose to examine the manifests of said vessels cargoes, and to report if any goods were imported contrary to said agree∣ment, and by whom: Accordingly the Com∣mittee proceeded on that business, and by their report at the adjournment it appeared that the whole of the goods imported in said vessels contrary to said agreement amounted to a very inconsiderable sum.—That only six persons out of the two hundred and eleven who were signers, were among the importers, who through inattention had omitted to coun∣termand their orders: but all of them readily and of their own motion agreed to deliver up the goods to be disposed of as the Committee should direct.—That the gentlemen who de∣clined signing the agreement had in general conformed themselves to it.—That as to those who had imported in the ships lately arrived▪ their importations were very small, and con∣sisted principally of duck and such other ar∣ticles as were not contrary to the agreement, <HI>except six or seven persons whose importations ap∣peared to be as usual:</HI>—It likewise appeared that a quantity of goods had been imported from New-York, since the first of January <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st.</P>
<P>The Merchants having considered this re∣port, voted, that the articles of their agree∣ment, should be printed in the public papers, and so that all concerned might the more rea∣dily recur to the same, and thereby avoid for the future the importing any goods contra∣ry to the said agreement: They, at the same time voted unanimously strictly to adhere to the same: and further agreed not to purchase <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> goods of any persons who lately have, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay import any articles from Great-Britain or from any of the colonies contrary to said agreement.</P>

<P>THE Merchants of this town met on the 26th of July last?

were large, and there appeared the greatest harmony and union among the Merchants in all their proceedings. Their conduct was spirited, and discovered that they were deter∣mined faithfully to observe and firmly to ad∣here to their Agreement; and that they were resolutely bent upon pursuing every legal method to guard against, and defeat any attempts that may be made, by those who were inimical to us, to render the same ineffectu∣al.—At the Meetings above mentioned, a number of Votes were passed, and the follow∣ing were ordered to be published.</P>

<HEAD>At a Meeting of the Merchants at Faneuil-Hall, August 11, 1769.</HEAD>
<P><HI>WHERE AS all the Well Disposed Merchants, not only of this, but of almost every Province thro' the Continent, have entered into an Agreement not to Import any Goods (some few necessary articles excepted) from Great-Britain and it evidently ap∣peared from the latest advices from our most judi∣cious firmest and best friends in England, that a strict adherence to, and perseverence in said agree∣ment, is the most effectual method of obtaining the redress of our gri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vances the removal of the diffi∣culties under which the commerce of North Ameri∣ca at present labours, and of preserving our inva∣luable rights, liberties, and priviledges:</HI></P>
<P><HI>VOTED,</HI> That such persons as have im∣ported, and continue to import directly or in∣directly, any articles restricted by the agree∣ment above refered to, and still refuse to join their fellow citizens in so salutary a measure, and thereby counter-act their generous ef∣forts, ungratefully take an advantage of those who are sacrificing their private interest to the good of the public, and at the same time, that they discover a total disregard to the li∣berty and welfare of their country, manifest an unwarrentable, base and sordid attah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ut to themselves, and their own private concerns; and by continuing their importations, are conducting in such a manner as will directly and evidently tend to the great discourage∣ment and real damage of trade; and to de∣feat the noble exertation of our friends, and strengthen the hands of our enemies, and if after the mild treatment they have met with, and the pains that has been taken to convince them of the utillity and necessity of so salu∣tary measure, they should persist in importing they must be considered as enemies to the con∣stitution of their country; and must expect that those who have any regard for it, will endeavour in every constitutional way to pre∣vent their building themselves up upon the ruin of their Fellow Citizens.</P>
<P><HI>Voted,</HI> That from a regard to our country, a concern for posterity, and in justice to our∣selves, we will not purchase any articles of such persons as import contrary to the agree∣ment aforesaid▪ and that a true list of their names be published in the News-papers, that we may have the concurrence of every person on this Continent who has the public welfare at heart, in rendering their base and danger∣ous designs abortive.

<HEAD>To the PUBLIC,</HEAD>
<P>MY NAME being inserted in the above Advertisement, the purpose of which is sufficiently evident, and published on Monday August 14th 1769, in the Massachusetts Ga∣zette or Boston-Postboy, printed by J. Green and J. Russell, in the Boston Evening Post, printed by T. and J. Fleet, in the Boston Ga∣zette or Country Journal, printed by Edes and Gill, in the Massachusetts Gazette or Boston News-Letter of this day, printed by R. Dra∣per, and in the Essex Gazette of the 15th of August, printed by Samuel Hall in Salem; I have thought it necessary, for the informa∣tion of the public, and out of regard to my character, to enter upon my own vindication.</P>
<P>Every individual has a natural right to defend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and reputation, and in soci∣ety to act <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>edom under obedience to the Laws; I shall therefore attend these "WELL DISPOSED MERCHANTS," as they call them∣selves, through the whole course of their trans∣actions and the whole tenor of their conduct, being fortunately possessed of proper materi∣als and authorities for accomplishing this un∣dertaking, which though laborious will af∣ford matter of great curiosity, and I hope will prove of singular utility to the public, by opening a view into the behaviour of these <HI>"Well Disposed" Gentlemen.</HI></P>
<P>In pursuance of this task, I shall present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acts, not offer conjectures; and as I have taken up the pen, not with an intention to injure, but to vindicate and correct, the pub∣lic shall find me decent and candid, but not on that account, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s resolute and persevering. To render this <HI>address</HI> useful to the Gentlemen themselves, it shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e my care to collect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> features of their actions, which I earnestly re∣commend to them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sure up as a precious record, and when, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> future, they feel them∣selves <HI>disposed</HI> to engage in any affair of im∣portance, I give i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a my best advice, that they ought to read this publication with the most diligent attention, as it will certainly operate effectually as a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>vative against the fur∣ther commission <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—▪ It is not their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but their reformation I fervently wish, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owever <HI>"well dispos∣ed"</HI> they may have shewn themselves to in∣jure my.—I therefore bespeak the candour▪ the patience, and the attention of the public with whose countenance and favour I have been so often and so greatly indulged, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which my heart shall ever retain the most grateful remembrance.</P>
<P>In my various Occupations I daily suppor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no less <HI>than seventeen People,</HI> fourteen of whom live under my own roof, the greatest part of these must have been turned off destitute, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have been supported in idleness, had I signed the Agreement. With regard to the consump∣tion of articles manufactured here, I have within little more than two years, being the time since I commenced Printer, purchase<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> PAPER, for the Printing Business made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Milton, to the value of between <HI>three</HI> and <HI>four hundred Pounds lawful Money;</HI> and I would have purchased to double the amount, if the Makers could have supplied me. And in par∣ticular, very lately, I wanted to agree with them for paper to the value of upwards three hundred pounds lawful money, on purpose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reprint here, a work, the production of the most excellent writer now existing, in which order, government and civil society are trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ed from the first dawnings of light, till the advanced to the full splendor of day.—
<PB N="5" REF="011336_0005_0F8580B51B0465A8"/>
A work which could hardly fail of meeting with a favourable reception among a liberal people, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourses of instruction ought to equal their thirst for knowledge.</P>
<P>In the BOOKBINDING TRADE, in which I have always <HI>four</HI> or <HI>five People</HI> constantly em∣ployed, to the <HI>Foreman</HI> of whom I pay yearly <HI>in Cash Sixty nine Pounds Six shillings and Eight Pence Lawful money:</HI> and in which business I do not use materials to the value of twenty Pounds Lawful through the whole year that is not manufactured in this Province.</P>
<P>As to my BUSINESS of BOOKSELLING, the necessity that a people eager after learning, and possessed of all the natural endowments of genius and parts requisite to its attainment, are under, of purchasing Books for the educa∣tion of youth, for instruction in the arts, sci∣ences and learned professions, renders their importation not only necessary, but laudable.</P>
<P>Having now given my reasons for declin∣ing to sign the Agreement concerning Non-Importation, which I hope will appear justifi∣able in the eye of the public; I now think it my duty to review the conduct of The <HI>"well disposed merchants"</HI> and in order to show that I sincerely wish to do them all justice, I shall print <HI>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbation</HI> their Agreement of August 1768, with their notifications and advertise∣ments to June 1st 1769, on which day, the snow Pitt, Capt. Tapscot, entered at the Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om house here, from Bristol in England, ex∣actly ten months after the agreement was signed.</P>
<P>The following manifest, and some others which will be speedily published, with <HI>the many respectable names</HI> in them, will best show the truth of their assertion, that the non-im∣portation Agreement was generaly conformed to, and that the importation were trifling.—It must likewise be proper to inform the public, that upwards of <HI>Thirty Vessels</HI> have arrived in this port from Great-Britain since January 1st 1769, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e exact account of their cargoes, shall be published in the course of this paper.—The one now published, is all at present that the attention due to my other avocations, would me allow time to prepare for the inspection of the public.</P>
<P>I intreat "THE WELL DISPOSED MER∣CHANTS" carfully to peruse the above Mani∣fest, and recommend it in a partlicular man∣ner to the attention of their Chairman, who may be a very good Distiller of Rum, for any thing I know, but who has no title to be cal∣led a Merchant, and he never had any con∣cern in importing Goods from Britain that I can learn.</P>

<P>HAVING learnt, the day after my last Pu∣blication, for the first time, that the Chairman of the Merchants, really imported goods from England, preceding the year 1761, I, with the utmost readiness, admit, during the period of his Importations, he ought to be considered as a Merchant; but being now occupied in a business so very different and having ceased Importation entirely for many years—however honourable he may be by station, or however respectable in his busi∣ness,—as a Distiller, he can, at present, have no title, even to the name of Merchant.</P>
<P>THE PUBLIC, will no doubt perceive, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the cargoes of the vessels, are given without regard to what was excluded from or incl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> in the Non-importation agreement; a regard to justice inducing me to lay the whole before them—and as the penetration of the can did readers must, often naturally, lead them to recur to the articles, agreed upon August 1768, they are, for that purpose, inserted anew in this paper.</P>
<P>That the <HI>"Well Disposed Merchants"</HI> who took the Lead at the different Meetings, have displayed ill grounded and pointed antipathy,
<PB N="10" REF="011336_0008_0F8580BA8E521F58"/>
in my case, must appear evident, as well as great partialities to others, when they allowed so many respectable and so many large Impor∣ters, as were mentioned in our last and in this Paper, to pass unnoticed.—A charge, which tho' sufficiently obvious already, shall be more ful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-demonstrated in the course of this laborious, yet necessary Undertaking.</P>
<P>Indeed these <HI>Few "Well Disposed" Leaders,</HI> not only, acted unjustly, with regard to me, who never was nor considered myself in the light of a Merchant; but they have also imposed upon the <HI>really</HI> well disposed part of the Gentlemen present at these Meetings, (who implicitly trusted to their information and report), by exhibiting a partial list of the Importers; and have since, by their Adver∣tisement, attempted to impose on the Public in general.</P>
<P>The Manifests of the three following Ves∣sels will contribute greatly to place this in a proper point of view.</P>

<P>THE Merchants of this town met according to adjournment on Thursday last, when the committee appointed to make enquiry relative to the importation of goods by the vessels late∣ly arrived from Great-Britain, reported, that five or six persons, who were signers to the late agreement, had received a few articles (the remains of former orders) and were rea∣dy to deliver them up to the care of the com∣mittee; and that some who where not signers had imported some goods prohibited by the late agreement, which as to quality and quan∣tity were very small.—The Merchants then appointed a committee to confer with the per∣sons last mentioned, and to consider what mea∣sures might be proper to take to prevent any further importation, and then adjourned their meeting to Tuesday next (to-morrow) at four o'clock P. M. to be held at Faneuil-hall, at which time and place a general attendance of the Merchants is desired, and those who have imported in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>late vessels are particu∣larly requested to be present.</P>

<HEAD>Anonymous Advertisements published in the Boston Evening Post, and Boston Gazette of Monday August 21, 1769.</HEAD>
<P>Mr. <HI>John Mein,</HI> Printer and Book∣seller from Scotland, having in his Chronicle of the 17th instant undertaken to vindicate his importing Goods contrary to the Agree∣ment of the Merchants, and also subjoined a partial Schedule of the Importations which have taken place from February to June last, declaring his intention to render the same compleat from the Custom House Entries, in the course of his Papers, the Public are desir∣ed to suspend their judgement upon this Af∣fair, as we learn the Committee of Merchants have it in their power to satisfy the most pre∣judiced that the account Mr▪ Mein has given cannot in the least invalidate the declarations that have been made from time to time on that subject, but choose to wait till Mr. Mein has finished his work, when they will doubt∣less undertake to undeceive them and prevent the mischief designed by his very impertinent and unjust representations of the affair. In the mean time, it may not be improper to remark, that his attempt to make the Public believe that the declarations of the Merchants in April last are untrue, because some impor∣tations were made six weeks after that time, is very extraordinary, and discovers that he has a peculiar knock at reasoning.</P>

<P>ACCORDING to a few lines inserted in Mr. Draper's paper of the 17th instant that the Committee were in hopes they should be rea∣dy against Monday to give the Public an ac∣count of Capt. Scott's cargo, (which being the more immediately under their inspection) which is agreeable to their own determina∣tion, and not from any thing Mr. Mein was pleased to publish as to goods imported con∣formable to the agreement of the Merchants, and those goods that are delivered up to the Committee, we shall save the Public the trou∣ble of going over, as well as the Printers of their labour, and hope the Public will receive it with candor and truth, notwithstanding it may be Mr▪ Mein will give it another gloss; But we defy him to detect any material <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ror,

which, if any, when thoroughly exa∣mined by that critic, may be magnified a Mole-Hill, to a Mountain, but, if when this comes in course with him, and there appears any thing worthy of notice, or that may not be satisfactory to the Public we shall endeavour to explain it to their satisfaction, confining ourselves to this Town, as to detecting any Im∣porters contrary to agreement and giving ac∣count of those persons who persist in import∣ing, and will not join with the Merchants in the agreement they have entered into for the good of their country—They now give the Public an account of the goods imported in said Ship, for persons of this and other Towns, expecting their committees take care of their own transgressors.—They also insert the goods for others governments.</P>

<HEAD>To the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>I Present my compliments to the Authors of the above Advertisements; I am really sor∣ry they neglected to sign their names to their publications; charity herself must only im∣pute it to forgetfulness, and far be it from me to hint that it was either owing to shame or timidity.—On the contrary with real good will, I beg of the Authors to remedy this omission in their next pieces, for such naked Advertisements cannot gain any degree of cre∣dit with impartial readers.</P>
<P>I shall make but few strictures on these two publications, it being beneath any man to contend with opponents sheltered under a mask: I shall however, condescend for once, and I intreat the Public carefully to read the last sentence of the first Anonymous Advertise∣ment, and then to consult the Boston Chro∣nicle of last Monday, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n which, the manifests of two vessels, belonging to Mr. Hancock, are given; one of which vessels arrived April 10th, the other on the 18th of the said month; and also to compare the following cargo, [brought in the London Packet, Capt. Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ef, which vessel was entered at the Custom House here April 19th, 1769,] with the reports of the few <HI>"Well Disposed" Leaders</HI> which were printed May 1st and 4th, 1769. But this, as I have already declared shall be more fully demonstrated in the course of this undertak∣ing.</P>
<P>On reading the <HI>"True account"</HI> given of Capt Scott's Cargo by the <HI>"Well Disposed"</HI> committee, I felt sentiments arise in my mind, which would be painful to me to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earse.—I therefore merely out of pity and compassion, most earnestly beg of them, for their own sake, to take their <HI>"True account"</HI> again into their serious consideration, and not again present it to the public, till they have made the necessary amendments.—Wishing they may adopt this advice, I shall for the present draw a veil over that Publication.</P>

<P>As Carriages generally take precedence in every procession, I have followed the common practice, in placing foremost the Chaise con∣signed to a worthy Gentleman of this Town: begging of him at the same time to account to the Public, how such a Vehicle happened to be imported amidst our resolutions of oeconomy: I do not say it was for his own use, but why did he become a channel of conveyance for such an article of Luxury▪—This really ought to be explained.—If age or infirmi∣ty render a carriage necessary, it is both just and reasonable, that our own Artists have the preference; and I can point out to the Importer, a Gentleman, in that branch of bu∣siness in this Town, equal to any Artist in Great-Britain.</P>

<P>I said in my first publication that I should present facts, not offer conjecture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—I stated this fact just as it appeared by the Cocket, the pieces on both sides of which are named Bri∣tish Linen. Mr. Hancock's correspondent in London, George Hayley, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> entered out a 100 pieces British Linen, and Mr. William Palfrey, Clerk to Mr. Hancock in Boston, has made oath that they are "100 pieces Russia Duck," which he says, in his declaration, pre∣ceding his oath, is frequently mentioned as British Linen in the Cockets.—Mr. Hancock's correspondent and the Merchants in London, are really singularly obliged to Mr. William Palfrey for publishing to the world this inge∣nious discovery.—Some people on reading his declaration, his oath and the above Coc∣ket, might be apt to imagine that the Mer∣chants in London, <HI>"frequently"</HI> committed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: an imputation which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for my own part, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>

Hancock's own correspondent, a Merchant of great distincti∣on in the city of London, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by a Cocket signed by the principal officers of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his also may appear extraordinary to Mr. Palfrey, and indeed I must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is some∣what mortifying.—This affair then at present rests between Mr. Hayley, a Merchant in London of great character and extensive busi∣ness, and Mr. William Palfrey, clerk to Mr. Hancock.</P>
<P>I take this opportunity to declare that I never will enter into a dispute with servants▪ except in such a case as this, in which the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r is absent.</P>
<P>When abusive terms are thrown out, I shall never condescend to take the least, notice of them, and I shall always support that can∣dour, calmness, and decency, which becomes every person to show who addresses himself to the Public.</P>
<P>And now let me beg of the <HI>"Well disposed Merchants."</HI> who have taken upon them to publish Advertisements and Reports, to produce their second <HI>"True Account"</HI> of Capt. Scott's Cargo, and also not to forget Capt. Smith's. I do not wish for an opportunity to charge them with remissness, but surely they who reported so expeditiously on up∣wards of a dozen cargoes which arrived its A∣pril, will be l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able to some suspicion of it, if they withhold from the Public any longer what they have so confidently and so repeat∣edly promised.</P>

<HEAD>To the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>August</HI> 31st, 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MR. Thomas Gray having acted with the candour and good manners becoming a gentleman of his fair character, I believe what he has declared to be true, that the <HI>"Bales T. G. No.</HI> 1 <HI>and</HI> 2, <HI>were Ravens Duck and Ticklingburgh:"</HI> These bales, however, were entered out by the name of German and Russia Linen; and I could not divine that they had any other name: but granting I had possessed that happy talent, I could not in ju∣stice to the Public or to myself, have mentioned them, under any other denomination than that expressed in the cocket. As to the 26 casks marked J. S. and consigned to him, there was no cocket for them; they were only in the manifest; it was my duty to give them to the Public exactly as the master had put them in his manifest; for it would have been impro∣per for me even to conjecture what they contain∣ed, when the manifest, though it mentioned the marks, number of the casks, and persons name to whom consigned, did not mention the contents. It would not have been amiss, however, if Mr. Gray had, in his Advertise∣ment, told the Public the contents of these casks.</P>
<P>Several Anonymous publications having been inserted in Messrs. Fleets and Edes and Gill's, News-papers of Monday last—I call upon the authors of them to make known their names: as every man who takes the freedom of addressing the public ought to do,
<PB N="35" REF="011336_0020_0F8580C6A4E81EC0"/>
not only that he may be the more readily be∣lieved, but also, out of respect to the tribu∣nal to which he makes his appeal. I have al∣ready repeatedly declared that I would pay no attention to Anonymous Writers: they in∣deed sufficiently reply to their own perform∣ances by their fear and shame of avowing them openly.—If they came from <HI>a few of the "Well Disposed" Leaders,</HI> they no doubt shuddered at the very thought of confessing themselves the authors of such pieces, in which veracity is so deeply wound∣ed and their own unworthy conduct so filthily slubbered over.</P>
<P>The Merchants in general in this Town, Province, and Continent, and every unpreju∣diced Reader, will▪ at one view, on perusing their weak, confused performances, see, that the more they struggle against truth, the more they will expose and bewilder themselves by their contradictions.</P>
<P>I, therefore, out of tenderness to you, the <HI>"Well Disposed"</HI> recommend again your <HI>"True Account"</HI> of Capt. Scott's and Capt. Smith's Cargoes, to your most serious consi∣deration</P>
<P>Please also to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour the Public with a list of the signers to the Agreement of August; 1768?</P>
<P>Pray let us know who were the six signers, <HI>Who through inattention had omitted to conter∣mand their orders</HI> and how you disposed of the goods of these <HI>six inattentive signers?</HI></P>
<P>Do likewise imform us how the Committee disposed of the goods, put into their hands last April, as well as the Marks, Numbers, Contents of the various Packages with the per∣sons names to whom they were consigned?</P>
<P>But, above all, it would be a great piece of satisfact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to the Public to learn, and surely very great condescension in the Committee, to point out where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> kept Store May 3d, 1769.</P>
<P>I hope the Committee will feel <HI>well dis∣posed</HI> to answer these questions; and that they will not be ashamed to do it in their own proper names: As I shall then think it a duty incumbent on me to give a pointed reply to every thing they advance.</P>
<P>At present, the public is greatly at a loss to know, <HI>Who ye are?</HI> You that have underta∣ken to regulate the Trade of the Town and the Province; and who have assumed a right to praise and to punish.</P>
<P>WHO ARE YE? YOU COMMITTEE MEN OF MERCHANTS! <HI>who disturb the Public with your anonymous clamours.</HI>—WE KNOW YE NOT.—<HI>For from the respectable list of Importers, we are really at a loss even to conceive, what are your designations, or where you reside.</HI></P>
<P>May I be indulged in a few observations on <HI>some of the "well disposed?"</HI> pray when you re∣view your past conduct, [though the hurry of action may have carried you through every s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>newithout hesitation,] in your cooler mo∣ments, Do you not even cease to esteem your∣selves? Do you never blush in secret, or when you meet each other in the street? Does reflec∣tion never awaken within you?—Does your past transactions, in your hours of retirement, never marshal themselves before your aching imaginations?—Do you never start in your sleep, while all nature is hush, and only the soul awake at its self-review?—Or, are you so dead and mortified to every sensation of Jus∣tice, that you can proceed in the uniform te∣nor of depravity, without the least remorse, without ever looking behind you?</P>
<P>If the smallest spark of honour, remains in your breasts, publish your names, that, perhaps will, however ill you may have behaved, im∣press the Public with a belief, that you have acted from principle; and that, however you may have erred, it must have been from de∣fect in judgment, not because you were des∣titute of worth.</P>

real well wishers of the Province are collected, do not give countenance to any Anonymous Publication; adopt a new plan on more mode∣rate principles; not such a one as some among you must be the first to break: and show to the world by your future behaviour that if private resentment, passion, or prejudice hur∣ried you beyond the bounds of your duty to your fellow citizens, that, on having the right path pointed out to you, you returned to it with gladness of heart.</P>

<HEAD>To the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>September</HI> 4<HI>th</HI> 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING been very unjustly treated in an anonymous Advertisement, I judged it necessary, in my own defence, to give my rea∣sons for declining to sign the non-importati∣on agreement; among which, were, the ne∣cessity I was under of supporting <HI>seventeen peo∣ple</HI> employed in a profession worthy of encou∣ragement in every civilized country, and in two other branches of business, closely con∣nected with, and immediately depending up∣on that profession. I have also shewn, that I have given very great encouragement to the manufactures of this province in my various occupations: And I can, with the most sacred adherence to truth, declare, that I have all along been deeply impressed with the warm∣est sense of gratitude for the many and great favours which I have received, and daily con∣tinue to receive, from the Public.</P>
<P>In this situation then, myself not a mer∣chant, and considering myself as wholly out of the line of the agreement against import∣ing English goods, for I never imagined that Books and Paper passed under that denomina∣tion; in this situation, I say, seeing myself attacked in the most unwarrantable and lurk∣ing manner, and being convinced too, that this attack proceeded from the private enmity of a few of the <HI>"well disposed,"</HI> was it not both natural and proper for me to undertake my own vindication?—Which could be ac∣complished in no other manner, than by giv∣ing my reasons, as I have already done, and also, the <HI>state</HI> of the importations since the a∣greement took place;—In which state, <HI>so ma∣ny very respectable Names appear,</HI> as must con∣vince the public, that the non-importation a∣greement, was not generally conformed to; and that the few <HI>"well disposed,"</HI> who publish∣ed the advertisement in which I was so inju∣riously used, could only be actuated against, me by the black passions of envy and mali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> when they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>permitted so many and such large importations, to pass unobserved.</P>
<P>In the course of this necessary undertaking I very justly published in the manifest of the Lydia, Captain Hood, five bales of British Linen, marked J. H. as they were shipped by Mr. Hancock's correspondent, and entered out in the Custom-house of London; which five bales so marked are, in the Master's mani∣fest, said to be consigned to John Hancock, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>—Mr. Hancock having gone out of town the morning of this publication, Mr. William
<PB N="40" REF="011336_0023_0F8580C8A8A02198"/>
Palfrey his clerk, made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ales con∣tained only "one hundred pieces Russia Duck; this occasioned a publication of an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sted Co∣py of the Cocket in the next Chronicle, to which Mr. William Palfrey made a long reply in the Boston News Letter of Thursday last, in which, though he says very little indeed to the matter in dispute, he talks much of his Master, him∣self, and his motives.—The case, in short, is just as follows:—Mr. Hancock's correspondent and the officers of the port of London, enter out 100 pieces British Linen, in five bales, marked, J. H. which bales, marked J. H. are mentioned in the manifest, consigned to John Hancock <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> so that in whatever light this mat∣ter is viewed, or in whatever manner it may be determined, I am fully defensible.—I was ob∣liged to give the contents of these bales as Mr. Hancock's correspondent entered them out at the port of London, as the Custom officers there cleared them out, and to annex Mr. Hancock's name to the bales so marked, as the master of his own vessel had done in the Manifest he de∣livered into this Custom-house.—This affair, therefore rests, as I said before, between Mr. Hancock's correspondent, a Gentleman of great and established character, and Mr. Wil∣liam Palfrey, Clerk to Mr. Hancock.</P>
<P>What Mr. William Palfrey says, concerning the publishing of the Cocket, being intended to convey the idea that his master had im∣ported a quantity of Stuffs, Gloves and Haber∣dashery, is both weak and ridiculous; for if his confusion would have allowed him, to read it, he must have perceived that all the other articles mentioned in it, have marks quite different from Mr. Hancock's; and if he had taken the trouble to compare these marks in the attested Cocket, with the Manifest of Capt. Hood's cargo as published by me, he would in one minute have found there, the persons names to whom these goods were consigned.</P>
<P>He likewise is very lavish of ill lan∣guage, and raves much about p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rty.—I was always too independent to adopt the principles of any party. Let the public judge, which of us is engaged in the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m of Par∣ty—he who in every sentence foams out abuse and party declamation, or he who sole∣ly attending to his own vindication never de∣viated so far from the subject, as to mention the word—This must appear so obvious to every candid reader, that I shall insist no far∣ther on the subject.</P>
<P>Without producing any thing to the point in question, Mr. William Palfrey, in his last publication, parades very much indeed, by which he appears to be mighty willing to raise a cloud, under the shade of which he might make his retreat, and at last fairly dives into the region of poetic nonsense, where at pre∣sent he remains immersed in obscurity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Few "Well Disposed"</HI> having been re∣peatedly called upon to publish a Manifest of Capt. Scott's cargo, the demand is again made, and I now take the freedom, with the <HI>"Well Disposed"</HI> to inform the public, that what has been published in two of the Mondays, and one of the Thursday's Papers as a <HI>True Account</HI> of that cargo, is very far from deserving that name.—I also desire them to give an account of the Marks, Num∣bers, Packages and Contents, of the goods that arrived in the Nassau, Capt. Smith, all of which are said, by an Anonymous Advertise∣ment, to be in their stores; if they really are so, they cannot be at any loss to satisfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the public.</P>
<P>The gentlemen concerned in importation, are advised to follow the open and candid ex∣ample, shewn them by Mr. Gray.</P>
<P>As Messrs. Averys have declared that they have not imported for two years, yet as the name of John Avery is in Capt. Coleman's manifest, which manifest is extremely dis∣tinct; I recommend also to the Committee, to apply to the owners, who certainly can in∣form them who paid the freight for these pack∣ages.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="011336_0023_0F8580C8A8A02198"/>
Mr. Francis Johonnot, has accounted for the trunk consigned to him with great clearness.</P>
<P>Mr. Benjamin Andrews, also deserves thanks for signing his name to his advertisement; though I wish he had been as explicit as Mr. Johonnot; there being no doubt, that these goods have been imported, it must be the bu∣siness of the person to whom they are con∣signed in the manifest, to point out particu∣larly how they have been disposed of, especi∣ally if that person is a signer to the agreement.</P>
<P>The <HI>few "well disposed"</HI> are in fact, at present, undergoing a course of discipline <HI>"a posteriori"</HI> that being the only method of attacking them, as they do not incline to show their faces.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the success of this publication with respect to the drawing them out to public view, I am well convinced, that it must have a very salutary effect on their future conduct in life, for they will neither be so forward, in time to come, to publish ano∣nymous advertisements filled with untruths, nor will they be so ready to break through <HI>"solemn agreements"</HI> which they may have signed.</P>

<P>MR. Francis Green having published, in the Boston-Gazette of last Monday, a sort of a defence of himself, in which he says, that the German and Russia linen, as entered out by his correspondent, and as clear∣ed out by the Officers of the port of London, <HI>"are Ravens Duck and Ticklinburgh:"</HI> Now, this simple affirmation of Mr. Francis Green's cannot be deemed a proper exculpation; he is therefore called upon, to exhibit his invoice, and at the same time, to name the number of pieces, yards, and time when shipped.</P>
<P>It was rather unfortunate too, for Mr. Francis Green to declare, that he can make it appear, he never ordered the four ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f allum and copperas; which is by no means a suffici∣ent apology; for to justify himself in the eye of the Public, it ought to be made evident, that he never received them into his custody; that the Committee took them into their pos∣session; that they remain so still; for in say∣ing, that he <HI>"submitted them to the direction of the Committee"</HI> is something very jesuitical.—Pray Mr. Francis Green, how did the Com∣mittee direct them to be disposed of? Do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so mention, where the Committee kept store the 1st of May last, the very day your vessel entered; because they may have given you <HI>"direction"</HI> to keep these 4 casks in your own store; and perhaps, by this time, you may have disposed of them.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> kind to yourself, as to mention the names of the six persons, in this town, whom you yourself confess to have imported goods? and that the town of Salem may not remain under the general imputation of breaking the agreement, indulge the public with the names of the Salem Importers?</P>
<P>To whom were the five chests of Tea mark∣ed H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consigned to, and where were they landed?</P>
<P>I did you all necessary justice concerning the goods landed at Salem, which I menti∣oned in the account I gave of your vessels cargo.</P>
<P>It behoves you Mr. Francis Green to be ve∣ry explicit in your reply, for if you shew any degree of equivocation, charity itself will be almost forced to place these five chests of tea, consigned to order, to your own particular account. But that you may vindicate your∣self <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ully is really my wish.</P>
<P>Mr. Hancock being now returned to town, it would seem a piece of justice in him, to in∣form the public, of the names of the Impor∣ters of the 75 barrels Gunpowder, and 34 casks of Cheese mentioned in the Manifest of the Last Attempt, Capt. Lyde; and the names of the persons to whom the packages, marked T. O. and G. D. in the Lydia, Captain Hood, were consigned.</P>

<P>The candour of the public will never per∣mit them to affix any belief to anonymous writers; for the purposes of men, who are a∣fraid to avow what they write, cannot be warrantable.</P>

<P>Indeed you appear to have some sense of shame left by your carefully concealing your own names; though your having some feel∣ings of this sort is not surprising; as people, whose behaviour has been regulated by pri∣vate interest and the baser passions, when un∣der the correcting hand of truth, and dreading a compleat exposure of their unworthy practi∣ces, must, even to themselves, on reflection, feel despicable.</P>
<P>Poor mistaken MEN! I leave you, for the present, under that contempt, which your bad intentions, your subterfuges, and your contradictions, must have excited in every ho∣nest heart.</P>

<P>I Hope Mr. Hancock, when he has leisure, will answer the questions, which have been twice put to him; as for his Clerk, till he can inva∣lidate the attested Cocket, which I have pub∣lished, it would conduce more to his master's service for him to be silent. Mr. Gray's cha∣racter, so well known, and so fully establish∣ed, entitles him to general respect▪ to mine he had a particular claim, that of having li∣mited himself solely to his own vindication, without descending to rake the kennels of abuse.</P>
<P>Mr. Handyside Peck is desired to inform the public, if he is a signer to the agreement, and to give his reasons for receiving into his cus∣tody, two hogsheads of Hats, and one case of haberdashery, consigned to him, which arriv∣ed in the London Packet, Capt. Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, in April last; and one case of Hats, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Pratt, Capt. Freemen, which also arrived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Apri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; both up∣wards of eight months after the non-importa∣tion agreement was signed.</P>
<P>Likewise to give an account of the contents of the case, marked THP. mentioned in the following <HI>attested cocket</HI> of the ship Thomas, Capt. Davies, to contain 20 dozen Castor, and 20 dozen Felt Hats; as it appears by the Bos∣ton Evening Post of this day, which I have just seen, that he has denied it contained Hats in a manner somewhat outrageous.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="011336_0028_0F8580CCE18D0CE0"/>

<P>Which Case marked THP is said in the Ma∣nifest, to be consigned to Thomas Handyside Peck, which Manifest was delivered in, and swore to, at the Custom-House here, by Capt. Davies.</P>
<P>The above Cocket puts me wholly out of the dispute; it proves the fact I had asserted:—How then could this weak man be so blind to all sense of decency and regard to himself and his friend at home! as to expose the latter to the charge of a false entry, and himself to be asked this question<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> What did the Box really contain? This man surely deserves pity! but perhaps, the Box contained Dye stuffs or In∣digo; if it was really this last mentioned arti∣cle, allow me, Mr. Peck, to propose a small a∣mendment to your next procession with your Box and Bell;—be sure to have the Word, INDIGO, painted, in large capital characters, on the sides of your Box;—let the number of the bells be encreased, and appended round your own neck, you will, then, be character∣istically dressed, and may prance before your decorated Box, with all the frantic solemnity becoming such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-show.</P>
<P>Every man before he attacks another, ought carefully to look at home; and though he thinks himself invulnerable there, a respect to his own character ought to prevent him from behaving with brutality. Mr. Thomas Han∣deyside Peck is therefore desired coolly to con∣sider this hint, and not in future to adopt has∣ty measures; for the Public may yet see his name appear in the Manifest of more than one vessel.</P>
<P>May the curtain of oblivion, for the present, wrap in its thickest folds, all remembrance of the affair above mentioned, it has only been thus far undrawn, to serve as a lesson to others, not to deviate into gross abuse.</P>
<P>The <HI>"Well Disposed" Committee</HI> are entreat∣ed to apply to the owners of the ship Thomas, Capt. Davies, for the names of the persons, to whom, the great quantity of the <HI>duty articles,</HI> marked H. the numerous casks and cases of Painters colours, marked J C. W G. J O. J G. W C. the several packages, marked X in a di∣mond, and J. ROWE army, were consigned: Under this last mark, several thousand yards of German Linen, which, it seems, is always <HI>Ravens Duck and Ticklenburgh, Sail-cloth or Duck, </HI> have been imported; by which the Public might be almost perswaded to believe, that the army were much engaged in naviga∣tion, and intended to equip a fleet. From the respectable characters of the owners, both as Merchants and Gentlemen, the Committee, I make no doubt, will meet with full satisfaction.</P>
<P>Some dark hints having been circulated by the <HI>"well disposed" Leaders,</HI> that they think it beneath them, to reply to me under their own proper names: I chuse to let them know, and they themselves, must be well convinced, that their behaviour greatly requires a vindi∣cation; and that to rest under the charges, with which I have arraigned them before the bar of the Public, displays neither prudence, patience, nor dignity; but is the strongest
<PB N="52" REF="011336_0029_0F8580CDB482B020"/>
proof, that can be given, of conscious weak∣ness, of conscious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear, and of conscious guilt.</P>
<P>If you the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> had acted justly, you would show, on your part, no pretences, no deficiencies; you would appear publicly; you would not be ashamed of your own cause. Private interest, must have been the motives of your actions, for men engaged in a great and good purpose, never wear masks, and are incapable of falsehood.</P>
<P>Deign, then, to take advice from one who is an enemy to your injustice, but in other respects, your sincere well wisher! would you wish to regain the attention and confidence of the public! candidly and openly confess your bad behaviour!—Honestly say, that your pri∣vate actions have not corresponded with your publications! ask pardon for the wrongs you have done individuals, and implore the for∣giveness of your country!—However, deep, therefore, your blushes may be, in this ad∣vised state of penance, it is your only re∣maining resource!—The track you are at pre∣sent p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsuing, will only plunge you deeper and deeper into the slough of disgrace and remorse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—You cannot but perceive it your∣selves, that your measures must be softened, and your conduct totally reformed!—Indeed, to look back, and return, is the only way you have left yourselves, to retrieve your reputa∣tions; or that can illuminate your breasts, with the smallest ray of comfort.</P>

<P>JUSTICE, and a regard to my own charac∣ter, would not permit me to be silent, af∣ter the attempt made to injure me by the <HI>"Well disposed'</HI> in their anonymous Adver∣tisement; and I certainly have made it plain, that their are many more <HI>Importers</HI> than those they have advertised.</P>
<P>I lay nothing before the Public but what is in the Cockets and in the Manifests, which are sworn to by the Masters of the several ves∣sels:—Every article that has been disputed by people who have signed their names, has been fully proved; and some of them, by struggling to extricate themselves, have only been more entangled in the net of evidence.</P>
<P>I therefore intreat Mr. Thomas Handasyd Peck to compare the <HI>attested Cocket,</HI> published in the Chronicle of Monday last, with his oath, printed in the Boston Gazette, or, Country Journal, of the same day; he will in that cocket see 20 dozen Castor, and 20 dozen Felt Hats, entered out in the Custom-house, London, and signed by the officers of that port; by the En∣dorsement on the back of the Cocket, these are said to be packed in a case, marked THP. which case so marked, is put down to Thomas Handasyd Peck, in the Manifest given in, and sworn to, at the Custom-house here, by Capt. Davies.</P>
<P>I have proved in the clearest manner, what I had asserted:—Mr. Peck, himself has even seen the original cocket: This matter, now, rests between Mr. Peck and his Correspondent, against whom, his oath, has proved a false entry.</P>
<P>I again call upon you, the <HI>"Well Disposed,"</HI> to publish your list of Signers;—to mention the number of packages you have in your store, and the names of those to whom they belong: and also to give the Public a more <HI>"true Account"</HI> of Capt. Scott's and Capt. Smith's cargoes:—and above all, do not forget to sign your own names; though, after so many repeated calls, I have little hope left, of your avowing trans∣actions, of which I believe you are thoroughly ashamed.</P>
<P>Does not cruel reflection haunt your solitary hours?—Do you not feel miserable under the stripes which your folly, impudence, and ini∣quity, have brought upon you?—If you have any thing human in you, you must feel them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—It is a mortifying truth, but I must tell it to you, that in the whole tenor of your con∣duct, you never seem to have been actuated by the slenderest idea of justice.—Do not then continue to abuse the patience of the Public, with anonymous falshoods! for words unsupported by proofs, must, to the judici∣ous and candid, appear dishonest and contemp∣tible—It is impossible to build a durable superstructure upon deceit and injustice; you may go on, indeed, for a while, and from hope may snatch a momentary gleam of success;—but time and truth, the te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of all things, will soon discover the insufficiency of your labour; and it will melt, like an image of ice, before the rays of the Meridian Sun.</P>

<HEAD>From the Newport Mercury, Inserted by desire of opposite Parties,</HEAD>
<P>THE Boston News-Writers make JOHN HANCOCK, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of the foremost of the Patriots in Boston, and the strictest obser∣ver of the agreement for non importation: he would perhaps shine more conspicuously, and be less suspected in this character, if he did not keep a number of vessels running to London, and back, full freighted, getting rich, by re∣ceiving freight on goods made contraband by the Colonies.</P>
<P>WHEREAS it is asserted in Messrs Edes and Gill's paper of Monday last, that the Mer∣chants in Boston had applied to the Custom-House Officers to examine the Cockets of the goods mentioned in the Boston Chronicle, and were refused: and as this assertion is denied by a number here, who say they pay greater regard to Mr. Sheafe's certificate, than to Mr. Palfrey's oath, 'tis requested that for the sake of truth, the said assertion, if possible, be au∣thentically proved, and published in the next Boston Papers. And at the same time, it is ex∣pected that Mr. Palfrey will confirm the truth of his oath, by the most substantial and un∣questionable evidence.</P>

<P>THE Publication, taken from the Newport Mercury, would draw from me some animadversions, if Mr. Hancock was at present, in the Province; but on account of his absence they shall be delayed.</P>
<P>Mr. Francis Green notwithstanding his va∣pouring, in the Boston Gazette, of monday September the 4th, seems now by his silence, to be much puzzled, with the few simple ques∣tions, which I thought proper to ask him, the Thursday after his appearance in print: this silence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears a very doubtful aspect, he ought to have embraced the first opportunity to vin∣dicate himself; if he is at a loss, let him take my advice, which I present to him with the greatest sincerity; that is, at once, to tell the whole truth, concerning the tea, allum, &amp;c. and then he will neither be reduced to the ne∣cessity of having recourse to subterfuges, nor will he lie under the suspicion of having im∣ported contrary to agreement.</P>
<P>The <HI>"well disposed"</HI> still obstinately conti∣nuing to conceal their faces, in spite of the se∣vere Castigation so frequently applied, must re∣ally excuse me, when I tell them, once more, that their account of Capt. Scotts Cargo, is very far from being a <HI>"true account:"</HI> I there∣fore, advise them, to be expeditious in making o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t another; otherwise I shall think myself in duty bound to compare that which they have already published with a manifest in my pos∣session; which, if the <HI>"w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll disposed"</HI> have the least grain of modesty remaining, will either prevent them from dece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ving the pub∣lic with false accounts of the importations, or will oblige them, in future, to give much honester reports. For the public begin shrewd∣ly to suspect, that, however <HI>"well disposed"</HI> some people may have been to sign, they have been fully, as <HI>"well disposed"</HI> to forget they had signed <HI>"their solemn agreement."</HI></P>
<P>The publication I am engaged in, may, with great propriety, be termed <HI>The Catechism of the "well disposed;"</HI> and I will venture to
<PB N="60" REF="011336_0033_0F8580D01BA8DB38"/>
assure them, if they decline returning the proper answers, they shall suffer due chastise∣ment.—Heartily, therefore, wishing their amendment, and recommending to their se∣rious consideration, the manifests already pub∣lished, and the corrections and admonitions, already bestowed, I take leave of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till next Thursday.</P>

<HEAD>THE FIRST PART of the CATECHISM of the WELL DISPOSED.</HEAD>
<P>I INTREAT the <HI>"Well Disposed",</HI> to answer the following questions; some of which have been repeatedly asked them.</P>
<P>Who were the <HI>"Seven Gentlemen"</HI> appoint∣ed, at the meeting Friday April 21st 1769, a Committee to examine the Manifests of the Cargoes of the vessels lately arrived, or that may arrive this spring from any parts of Great Britain.—Why were not the reports of these <HI>seven Gentlemen</HI> published?—What are the names of thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>seven Gentlemen?</HI>—</P>
<P>When the meeting was held again, accord∣ing to adjournment on Thursday April 27th, and when the Committee appointed to make enquiry relative to the importation of goods by the vessels lately arrived from Great Bri∣tain, REPORTED, that <HI>FIVE or SIX</HI> PERSONS who were Signers to the late agreement, had received a <HI>few articles,</HI> (the remains of former orders) and were ready to deliver them up to the care of the Committee.—I ask, why were not the names of the five or six Signers, who were so unlucky as to receive <HI>"the remains of former orders,"</HI> about eight months after the agreement was signed, made public, with an account of the contents.</P>
<P>The signers, who received <HI>"the remains of former orders"</HI> after such a distance of time, must have very dilatory Correspondents.</P>
<P>Please publish the marks, numbers, and packages, containing the <HI>"few Articles"</HI> so received?</P>
<P>Well, but, it seems, they <HI>"were ready to de∣liver them up to the care of the Committee."</HI> Did the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> take <HI>care</HI> of these <HI>"few Articles"?</HI> and, where did they keep store, Thursday April 27th, 1769?</P>
<P>At this Thursday meeting, it was also re∣ported, that some Gentlemen who were not signers, had imported some goods prohibit∣ed by the late agreement, which as to <HI>Qua∣lity</HI> and Quantity <HI>were small.</HI></P>
<P>Who were the <HI>"some Gentlemen"</HI> that im∣ported the <HI>"s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me goods prohibited,"</HI> by the late agreement, which, as to <HI>Quality</HI> and Quantity <HI>were small?</HI></P>
<P>Pray lay before the Public the packages and Contents?—It would also be very kind in the <HI>"Well Disposed,"</HI> when they publish the <HI>quan∣tity</HI> of these <HI>some Goods prohibited,</HI> to ex∣plain the meaning of <HI>"which"</HI> in <HI>"quality" "were small."</HI>—This phrase is, certainly, a∣bove the comprehension of most Readers; and, perhaps, may even exceed that, of most part of the Committee:—If this should really be the case, I beg of them to consult their intel∣ligent Chairman, whose deep discernment and▪ extensive knowledge, few things, within the circle of Science, can nonplus.</P>
<P>In the Advertisement, agreed upon at the next meeting, Tuesday, May 2d, it is said
<PB N="67" REF="011336_0036_0F8580D5420D6018"/>
that by the report of the Committee, it appeared that the whole of the Goods im∣ported in said vessels contrary to agreement, amounted to a very inconsiderable Sum.—Pray what Sum?—That only six persons out of the <HI>two hundred and eleven,</HI> who were Signers, were among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Importers, who, through inattention, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> omitted to coun∣termand their orders▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all of them rea∣dily and of their own motion, agreed to de∣liver up the goods to be disposed of as the Committee should direct.—Who were the two hundred and eleven signers?—Do likewise publish the names of the <HI>six inattentive Signers,</HI> who imported?</P>
<P>Did you, the <HI>"Well Disposed"</HI> Committee, <HI>"readily"</HI> acquiesce, in the motion so, <HI>"readily"</HI> made by the <HI>six inattentive signers;</HI> and how did you <HI>"direct" "the Goods to be disposed of?"</HI></P>
<P>I will be much obliged to the Well Dispos∣ed, if they will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> honest and faithful answers to the above questions; as I have some more to trouble them with.</P>
<P>The <HI>"well disposed"</HI> appear by their adver∣tisements, to be perfect masters of the <HI>"Double Entendre:"</HI> and I really believe that a <HI>"well disposed"</HI> Committee of the compleatest Pro∣ficients, from the schools of Loyola, could not surpass them.</P>

<HEAD>To the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>September</HI> 25<HI>th</HI> 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN pursuance of my promise to lay before the Public, a state of the goods imported from Great-Britain, since the beginning of January 1769—I published, on Monday, Au∣gust 31st, the manifest of the cargo of the ship Susanna, Henry Johnson, master, from Lon∣don, and owned by Mr. Francis Green of Bos∣ton; at the same time, civilly requesting, the nameless Committee of the <HI>"Well Disposed"</HI> to apply to the Owner, for the names <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the per∣sons to whom the goods consigned <HI>To ORDER</HI> belonged: in the manifest published by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which was taken from the Cockets and Mani∣fest, sworn to by the master of the vessel, were two bales of Russia Linen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our bales of Ger∣man Linen, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our casks of Allum and Copperas, consigned to Mr. Francis Green.</P>
<P>Mr. Francis Green, in the Boston Gazette, and Country Journal, of Sept. 4th, replied, that <HI>to frustrate the base design of deceiving the public, (which it seems is lately become a favo∣rite point with a few men more artful than ho∣nest) I take this method of publicly declar∣ing, that the articles (consigned to me) termed Russia linnen and German linnen in the manifest of the Susanna, Henry Johnson, from London, are Ravens Duck and Ticklinburgh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which it is well known were comprehended in that of Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Cloth or Duck. It is true the Allum and Cop∣per as were not enumerated among the allowed articles in the first agreement; but it is as true that I never ordered them, (which I am ready to make appear) and that I submitted them to the direction of the Committee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There were but six persons residing in this town who imported goods of any kind in the a∣bove vessel, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of what little was on board, were for Salem and Marblehead, where they were accordingly entered and delivered before the ship proceeded for this port.</HI>—</P>
<P><HI>I do not assert that the copy of the manifest and cockets is not literally true, yet if such a publication of it</HI> (<HI>without an explanation which might have been given</HI>) <HI>has a tendency to deceive, as effectually as a direct falshood could, the good intention and candor of the publisher, are</HI> (<HI>in charity,</HI>) <HI>referred to the judgment of the Public.</HI></P>
<P>It was observed, in the next Boston Chro∣nicle, Sept. 7th, that Mr. Francis Green, to exculpate himself, ought to exhibit his In∣voice, and mention the day the goods were shipped.</P>
<P>The following observations were also made and the following questions asked, which, Mr. Francis Green was intreated to answer, with candour, for the sake of his own character.</P>
<P>It was rather unfortunate too, for Mr. Francis Green to declare that he can make it appear, he never ordered the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our casks of allum and copperas; which is by no means a sufficient apology; for to justify himself in the eye of the Public, it ought to be made evident, that he never received them into his custody; that the Committee took them into their possession; that they remain so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; for in saying, that he <HI>"sub∣mitted them to the direction of the Committee"</HI> is something very jesuitical.—Pray Mr. Francis Green, how did the Committee di∣rect them to be disposed of? Do also men∣tion, where the Committee kept store the 1st of May last, the very day your vessel entered; because they may have given you <HI>"direction"</HI> to keep these 4 casks in your own store; and perhaps by this time, you may have disposed of them.</P>
<P>Be so kind to yourself, as to mention the names of the six persons, in this town, whom you yourself confess to have imported goods? and that the town of the Salem may not remain under the general imputation of breaking the agreement, indulge the public with the names of the Salem Im∣porters?</P>
<P>To whom were the five chests of Tea mark∣ed H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consigned, and where were they landed?</P>
<P>I did you all necessary justice concerning the goods landed at Salem, which I menti∣oned in the account I gave of your vessel's cargo.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="011336_0038_0F8580D63078A930"/>
It behoves you Mr. Francis Green to be very explicit in your reply, for if you shew any degree of equivocation, even <HI>"charity"</HI> itself, will be almost forced to place these five chests of tea, consigned To Order, to your own particular account. But that you may vindi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate yourself fully, is really my wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h.</P>
<P>On Sept. 18th, no reply being made by Mr. Francis Green, I put him in mind, that he seemed now by his silence to be much puz∣zled, with the few simple questions which I thought proper to ask him, the Thursday after his appearance in print: this silence bears a very doubtful aspect, he ought to have embraced the first opportunity to vin∣dicate himself; if he is at a loss, let him take my advice, which I present to him with the greatest sincerity; that is, at once to tell the whole truth, concerning the tea, allum, &amp;c. and then he will neither be re∣duced to the necessity of having recourse to subterfuges, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or will he lie under the sus∣picion of having imported contrary to a∣greement.</P>
<P>In answer to this, Mr. Francis Green pub∣lished a piece in the <HI>Massachusetts Gazette,</HI> or <HI>Boston News-Letter,</HI> of September 21st, of which the following extract contains the only apology, which he condescends to make for himself.</P>
<P>"DISDAIN," is <HI>the true cause of my not hav∣ing hitherto given any attention to his late public impertinent and arrogant queries and ob∣jections.—"I now assure the World" if any Gentleman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yet unsatisfied, and chuses to ap∣ply either to the</HI> Committee <HI>of</HI> Merchants <HI>or to</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>he may and shall be convinced beyond all possibility of doubt, that I did not deviate from the agreement in any-instance, of course, did not import any Tea.</HI></P>
<P>Then after throwing out the most illiberal abuse, without the least shadow of argument, he thinks proper to declare, that he will never answer any of my <HI>future publications.</HI></P>
<P>Now it is very likely, Mr. Francis Green, heartily regrets his not having adopted this prudent resolution much sooner.</P>
<P>When Mr▪ Francis Green, says, that the Allum and Copperas were not allowed by the first a∣greement, he is very right; his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our casks were imported here, May 1st, and the vote allow∣ing their importation, passed the 26th day of July after.</P>
<P>Mr. Francis Green also says, that HE <HI>was ready to make it appear, that</HI> HE <HI>never ordered them, and that</HI> HE <HI>had submitted them to the direction of the</HI> Committee.</P>
<P>The public will naturally judge from his <HI>"disdain"</HI> to vindicate himself, of the truth of these assertions. As for applying to him, after he had declared in print, that he was ready to make it appear, he never ordered the four casks, &amp;c. he may be very ingenious at proving a negative, but every impartial man will consider him as a delinquent, till he makes his vindication as public as his asserti∣ons.—As to the casks having been submitted to the care of the Committee, their silence and Mr. Francis Green's own words, will fully determine the opinion of the public; from me, they scarcely require a comment.</P>
<P>At the same time, that Mr. Francis Green desired those who were unsatisfied with his conduct, to apply to the Committee, he ought surely, for the information of the public, to have given the names of those, who compose that tribunal of deceit: For the Public are, at present, greatly at a loss, to conceive who they are.</P>
<P>It was very weak in Mr. Francis Green, when pressed by the above facts, and argu∣ments, to have recourse to <HI>"disdain"</HI> and gross reproach, instead of attempting to justify himself; when a man descends to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> its a sure sign of his defeat.</P>
<P>Now, to use the very words of Mr. Francis Green, let the public judge, who he is that en∣tertains <HI>"the base design of deceiving"</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and who he is that witholds the <HI>Explanation which might have been given.</HI> I really a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so far, with Mr. Francis Green, that deceiving
<PB N="73" REF="011336_0039_0F8580D6F57D38D8"/>
the Public <HI>is lately become a favorite point with "a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew men</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>"more as artful than honest;"</HI> but as the, public probably will think, neither artful nor honest.</P>
<P>Mr. Francis Green has yet to answer all the above Questions, which were put to him September 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>
<P>Having heard that Mr. Francis Green's first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was in the army; I am sorry, I did not know it sooner, that I might have given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of, Francis Green, Gentleman; his Majesty honoured him with a commission, but Mr. Francis Green, Gentleman, be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> knows the means which procured it: He there, I dare say, experienced that▪ among Gentlemen, questions must be answered point∣edly, and <HI>in propria persona;</HI> but perhaps, this method of procedure was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and did not suit his constitution: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there∣fore from danger, and the most honourable walk in life, he forced himself behind the counter, and exchanged the deadly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the yard stick and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:—Even there, the character of an English merchant, so justly re∣spected in a trading nation, could not prevail upon him to give a civil answer, to a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew civil questions, which were asked him, and which, a regard to his profession and reputation, ought to have made him perceive the necessi∣ty of answering:—Two paths were open to him, that of truth, which led to reformation, and that of evasion, which led to the encampment of the <HI>"Well Disposed."</HI>—The world need not be told, Francis Green, Gentleman, need not be told, which of these paths he hath chose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>I congratulate the <HI>"Well Disposed"</HI> on their noble acquisition, and him on his safe retreat from the character of an English merchant, to the vale of artifice and subterfuge, in the domains of the <HI>"Well Disposed."</HI></P>
<P>Francis Green, Gentleman, living so near me, if he thought himself affronted at my civilly intreating the Committee to apply to him, as owner of the Susanna, might have waited upon me, and endeavoured to convince me, that he had some title to the appellation, so frequently, here, bestowed on him: but the dirty road of abuse, best suiting his natural bi∣as, he wallowed in its more, with that intem∣perance▪ be sitting a man, afraid of argument and hardened against plain dealing, though under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s;h of conviction▪</P>
<P>But perhaps, after all, the weakness of his intellects has only made him the tool of some more c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing man.—If this should be the case he is indeed much to be pitied!</P>
<P>Let Francis Green, Gentleman, accept the advice I now give him, which is, if he has a∣nother opportunity of addressing the public, for his own sake to do it with decency.</P>
<P>The <HI>"Well disposed"</HI> will please to consi∣der the following question as part of their Catechism.</P>
<P>Was it your intention to confine the whole Trade to yourselves and your friends, that you might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll your refuse goods; and im∣port anew under the mask TO ORDER, on purpose to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll at a higher advance, than the usual profit? This, whatever gloss you may please to put upon it when you reply, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> public in general, and the Gentlemen and Traders, in the Country in particular, are probably sensible of by this time.</P>

<P>IF there are any among us so base as to break through a solemn agreement, I would beg leave of the public, to exculpate myself from the scandal of being ranked among the num∣ber, by informing them that (although my name justly appears in Messrs. Mein and Free∣ming's paper of last Thursday as an impor∣ter) at the time the agreement took place here, I was in London; therefore could not become a subscriber. Immediately after my return, understanding the agreement was ge∣neral, and strictly adhered to, that I might not be any ways instrumental in counter∣acting the good design, I unsolicited counter∣manded large orders which I left in London for spring-goods; thereby in a great mea∣sure frustrating my design in going home.—The few haberdashery goods which arrived, I had ordered, and expected to be sent imme∣diately after me, which was the only reason of my not countermanding them. One of the Commitee was fully satisfied by me at the time, of the truth of the above, and of the trifling value of the goods, which prove that there could not be either a fradu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt or mer∣cenary design in that importation.</P>

<P>Dr. Martin Brimmer, having last Monday evening, just after the Chronicle was publish∣ed, politely informed me, that he imagined the 9 Casks of Cheese mentioned in the Mani∣fest of the Nancy, to be consigned to Martin Brimmer, should have been put down to An∣drew Brimmer.—On inspecting the Manifest, he was found to be in the right, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was immediately altered in all the papers not printed off: and this is now inf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted, that our Subscribers may correct it in those wrought off before the mistake was disco∣vered. This Error was occasioned by the word being written in a very indistinct manner, in the Master's manifest.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all our care, in such a la∣borious task, a small error may sometimes e∣scape our notice; we, however, have reason to be pleased, that the above is the only one we have been able hitherto to discover after repeated comparisons; and if in the remain∣ing part, any others should happen, we shall acknowledge them without the least reserve.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>October</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>PREVIOUS to the continuation of the <HI>Catechism</HI> of the <HI>"Well disposed",</HI> and to the observations that it may be ne∣cessary to make on their Advertisements, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣treat the attention of the Public to the follow∣ing story; which every Reader shall, for the present, be left to apply as he shall think pro∣per.</P>
<P>ONE Evening, in the month of August, no matter for the day or year, two travel∣lers arrived at a certain town in the western hemisphere, and took possession of a large front room in the coffee house, which for the sake of the story, we shall, at once, suppose, to be the British Coffee-house, King-street, Boston; intending to solace themselves after the fatigues of a warm day's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide:—They were scarcely seated, when a clamour of tongues issuing from an adjoining room, though they were not fond of listening, first drew, and then by its continuance, fixed their attention. It was soon discovered, notwithstanding the in∣coherency of the conversation, that this noise proceeded from a motley Crew, called a Com∣mittee, as our Travellers lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t from their own mouths:—And we, on our part, shall sup∣pose, for the j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke's sake, that they too were, <HI>"Well Disposed."</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>"Well Disposed"</HI> Committee, "then, by their own account, appeared to have been, for some time, engaged in a deep and complica∣ted scheme to deceive the whole country, by declaring confidently in the face of the Pub∣lic, that there was no necessity for importing goods from the Mother country, and that none should be imported:—The motives that first occasioned this scheme to be set on foot being foreign to our purpose, we shall not pretend to explain them; our sole intention being only to make it evident, in what mann∣er this agreement was kept, after it was en∣tered into,</P>
<P>In the sequel, however, it will be plain be∣yond dispute, as it was to our Travellers who over-heard <HI>these "Well Disposed,"</HI> that views of private emolument, not regard for the public weal, had prompted many of them to insist in this undertaking;—in furtherance of which they had carried about a subscripti∣on against importation, among the Merchants and Traders, several of whom they had either wheedled or frightened into their measures; assuring all they applied to, that the plan was now generally adopted, and that it would be hurtful to themselves, if they, and longer, with∣stood the opinion of the whole Community.</P>
<P>Here it ought to be observed, that although many among them engaged from the most disinterested motives, others signed merely out of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>on, never having dealt in the ar∣ticles they had agreed not to deal in, being in very different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of life; and so making a merit of signing, not to do, what they had never done before; and what severals of them had neither opportunity nor inclination to do. The <HI>"Well Disposed" Leaders,</HI> however, pushed their project with all the artifices and machi∣nations that self-interest could dictate to men, totally deadened to or devoid of, every principle of justice:—And, at last they arrived to such a pitch of enormity, that, when some individu∣als, who solely depended on their trade for support, refused to starve themselves, while some of the principal of the <HI>"Well Disposed,"</HI> even <HI>Committee-men,</HI> infringed the agreement in the grossest manner, and by importing largely, carried on their trade with superior advantages, these <HI>"Well Disposed▪"</HI> printed Advertisements, and circulated them through the whole country, painting these Refusers in the most odious and malignant colours.</P>
<P>Unluckily for the <HI>"Well Disposed,"</HI> in this list, they inserted the name of a very peace∣able man, one who was not a Merchant, and who had always closely attended to his own business, without interfering with that of o∣ther mens; now, as good natured folks are ge∣nerally the worst to deal with when through∣ly
<PB N="85" REF="011336_0045_0F8580DF204BF5A8"/>
provoked, this person had been so assiduous in tracing their past transactions as really to discover their whole design: and was then en∣tertaining the Public with an exposure of the conduct and honesty of <HI>these "well disposed" Committee-men,</HI> who were now met together, for the purpose of replying to this very Person.</P>
<P>Our Travellers received from this occur∣rence, a sort of Tragi Comic entertainment; the mean evasions to which the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> resorted, and the weak subterfuges, under which they attempted to conceal or slur over the truth, frequently excited laughter, indig∣nation and contempt: for when they spoke sing∣ly, they were as far from agreeing upon what was proper to be done, though they all agre∣ed something ought to be done, as when they clamoured in concert.</P>
<P>Their Chairman, then, not being able to bring them to any consistent resolution, and never having depended much on his own ge∣nius, even in writing <HI>"well disposed" Adver∣tisements.</HI> because he had just sense enough to discover his own deficiency; and what is also part of the truth, he was, really and tru∣ly, in other people's trammels, who goaded him which ever way they pleased; he at last thought fit to pull out of his pocket, a very long paper, which had been purposely pre∣pared for this occasion, by <HI>a select few of the particularly well disposed,</HI> who very well knew that nothing passable could be produced from the grave solemn heads of the <HI>Committee;</HI> whose appearance, at first sight, announced them to be men of <HI>Weight,</HI> without <HI>Importance.</HI> It is not to be doubted, but this paper was intro∣duced with a very proper speech from the Chair; indeed it might, with great justice, he called, <HI>the Mystery of the "Well disposed";</HI> and it is to be hoped, that by some chance or other, this Mystery may happen in time to be <HI>opened up.</HI></P>
<P>As it was read in an audible voice, para∣graph by paragraph, commented and recom∣mented upon, not with an intention to tell the truth, but very piously to avoid it, our Travellers heard every word distinctly; the declared design of <HI>this committee Meeting</HI> was to shroud the truth, to throw a specious gloss over their own behaviour, and to please, at the same time, that they deluded the peo∣ple. Nevertheless, while we correct, let us be just—One of the Committee, though a <HI>great offender,</HI> not being able to smother the gnaw∣ings of conscience, often attempted to retire, but though the Monitor within, in spite of the support of his Confederates around him, point∣ed out the right path, he had not strength of mind sufficient to resist their repeated in∣treaties, or, to forsake them, and leave them to their own devices.</P>
<P>But now let us rehearse some part of their <HI>mystical</HI> composition,—It was mentioned in it, that there were <HI>few who had refused to join them;</HI> yet in the cargo of the Pitt, Capt. Tapscott, from Bristol, the very first of the manifests published, they declared that <HI>of the</HI> 15, <HI>who were inhabitants of this town, only</HI> FOUR <HI>were signers to the agreement.</HI>—It is something surprizing, that so <HI>many</HI> of the <HI>"few who had refused to join,"</HI> should appear in the very first Manifest.</P>
<P>The Story shall be shortened for the present, because it <HI>shall</HI> figure more at large;—but the following quotations, which are sup∣posed to approach nearly to the very words of the <HI>"Well disposed,"</HI> cannot be omitted, with any propriety. <Q><HI>Mr. Newell imported only tin and iron plates, which, although they were not inserted in the agreement, yet at the time of entering into the same, it was generally under∣stood, that the importing of them would not be considered as breach of the agreement.</HI> Now it naturally occurs to the writers of this narra∣tive, that it was certainly a very great pity, and <HI>probably</HI> a very great loss, to every <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> in this town, in this province, and in every other town on this continent, who had not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>understanding,</HI> as Mr. Newell.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Newell's pardon is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if his ordi∣nary denomination is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="86" REF="011336_0046_0F8580DFE0D6A978"/>
<HI>Well Disposed Committee</HI> are solely to blame for this want of respect. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st therefore con∣tinue to mention this Gentleman, only by the name of Mr. Newell, with the additional title of Timothy, with which we now address him with great pleasure, both from the authority we have for bestowing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as well as from our parti∣cular regard to a gentleman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his worth. We cannot help repeating it, that it is much to be lamented, that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o Tin and Iron plates, it was not so <HI>generally understood, that the im∣porting of them would not be considered as a breach of the agreement▪</HI> If it had been <HI>de signed</HI> to be <HI>understood,</HI> surely it would have been advertised, and then the heart of every <HI>Tin man</HI> would have rejoiced: <HI>Yea!</HI> and the heart of every other <HI>IMPORTER</HI> too, for e∣very one would then with as good reason, as Mr. Timothy Newell, have <HI>understood</HI> that the particular articles they dealt in, when import∣ed, <Q><HI>would not be considered as a breach of the agreement</HI>—Even though they never had <HI>signed</HI> the Agreement, and what is more, ne∣ver had been of the Committee, who <HI>car∣ried</HI> the paper about, and <HI>pressed</HI> for subscrip∣tions.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Now, also,</HI> in the Brig Paoli, Capt. Hall were imported, by <HI>Messirs. Barrett and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a case called</HI> FOR SOME GOOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> DOUBT TURNERY, <HI>whereas in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and should have been called</HI> WOOL-CARDS. Now i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Messrs. Barrett and Sons, are Mr. Deacon Bar∣rett and Sons, the Good Deacon can easily b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> informed, that the <HI>"some good reason"</HI> why WOOL-CARDS" were entered out as TUR<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>NERY, was to cheat the King of the duty on Wool-Cards.—This was really a very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lucky observation in the <HI>"well disposed</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are therefore desired to Apply to the <HI>Good Deacon,</HI> who certainly will without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣sitation inform them, who enjoyed the bene∣fit of this fraud.</P>
<P>Want of time will not allow us, at present to relate much more of the particulars <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> re∣ceived from our friends, the Travellers, con∣cerning what they heard, and what they saw, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing at the <HI>"well disposed."</HI>—A few observations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made by the Travellers on what they heard, however, may be mentioned.</P>
<P>On <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Travellers, who were deeply read in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, in a familiar conversation informed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that the doctrine of the ancient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seemed to flourish with new vigour in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>me.—On being desired to ex∣plain themselves, they said, that when a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew, in time of distress o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> necessity, made a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow, either to God or M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, which he afterwards found would be extremely inconvenient for him to fulfil, that all he had to do, was, to as∣semble there other Jews. and they, agreeable to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doctrine, could absolve him from performance.—On this, it was asked, how the doctrine of the Robbins could be applied to the present times;—but the Enquirer was im∣mediately silenced with,—have not two saints a power to exercise a greater privilege than three Jews.</P>
<P>Let us for a moment return to our Travel∣lers account of the <HI>"well disposed Committee."</HI> They after determining to print <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> honest effusion of theirs, in some of the first news∣papers, really signed to if, not their own names, but the collective name of a worthy body of men, most of whom detested the practices, and despis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the intellects of this <HI>Precious Set,</HI> and very few of whom even knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>"well disposed"</HI> meeting.</P>
<P>This important affair being then so far set∣tled, yet as the most hardened mind cannot help feeling severe compunctious, when about to commit a crime.—<HI>One even</HI> of the <HI>well disposed,</HI> struck with dread at what he had just consented to, ventured to enquire if all they had resolved to declare to the public, was true.—Hackneyed as the Chairman was in the ways of the <HI>"well disposed,"</HI> this sim∣ple question, fairly put him out, and by a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and an inarticulate sound which follow∣ed, it was imagined, he had been occupied in scratching his head, and pulling up his
<PB N="87" REF="011336_0046_0F8580DFE0D6A978"/>
breeches:—but, at last, having gathered up his wits, he declared, <HI>It was to matter, part of it was true enough▪ and they had a right to say the test:</HI>—having disburthened himself, in this manner, he huddled up the paper, into his packet; and they all retired, with conscious gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t glaring on their faces.</P>
<P>This narration was communicated by se∣veral gentlemen, who heard it from the two Travellers: It is here inserted, and the candid reader is left to make his own reflections on this strange though very true story.</P>
<P>In what a miserable situation are the <HI>"well disposed,"</HI> without honesty enough to de∣clare the truth, to confess their faults, and en∣deavour amendment; they chuse rather to proceed in the uniform tenor of corruption; unhappy in themselves, execrating the honest part of mankind, and pitied, despised and de∣tested by every man of sensibility and prin∣ciple.—What consultations must such men have, and what must be their reflections after such consultations!—Every new determination of theirs must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it heavier and heavier on their souls!—They are again beseeched to bethink themselves, the sooner they do it, the less they will have to repent of!—A candid and pub∣lic confession of their bad behaviour will con∣vince the public of their sincerity, and enti∣tle them, at least, to forgiveness, if not to favour.</P>
<P>They have already attempted to screen them∣selves under the name of a <HI>respectable commu∣nit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> who are shocked at their conduct.—They, it is easy to conceive, would be glad to gain a refuge still more general.—Men conscious of their own weakness, folly, and depravity never think themselves under too close and hick a covert.</P>

<P>MR. William Palfrey, Clerk to Mr. Han∣cock having again attacked me in print, for publishing in the Chronicle, a piece from the Newport Mercury, signed the AMERICAN SPY, on which account he charges me with in∣consistency, as I had often declared that I would take no notice of Anonymous publications;—Now, that publication was sent from the Custom-house, Boston, together with the an∣swer to what related to the Custom-house, both which pieces were desired to be published, in order to contradict a falshood which had been asserted in the Boston Gazette—that the mer∣chants had applied to the Custom-house and were refused a sight of the Cockets.—To make this plain, I even printed the <HI>Note</HI> in which the two pieces were inclosed, and Mr. William Palfrey must have seen it clearly himself, but it did not suit his purpose to represent it in the true light.</P>
<P>What Mr. William Palfrey says of his mas∣ter, John Hancock, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> being singled out by me as a particular object of resentment, must appear untrue to every impartial man; he has hitherto only been asked the question which all the owners of the other vessels have been asked.—Who paid the freight of the goods consigned To Order?—They were called up∣on
<PB N="93" REF="011336_0049_0F8580E21D412A90"/>
publickly, and it was the duty of every own∣er to make the truth appear as far as he was able, that the public might not be deceived.</P>
<P>To make general charges of inconsistencies, misrepresentations and calumnies.—Impu∣dence only is requisite:—but if any person, whose name is mentioned in the Manifests pub∣lished in this paper, chuses to dispute any ar∣ticle, it shall be authenticated in such a man∣ner as to convince every candid Reader:—not one article that has been objected to as yet, by those who have signed their names, but has been proved by the most incontestible evidence.</P>
<P>As, Mr. William Palfrey, if I am not much mistaken, was Clerk at the Merchants meet∣ings, I must ask him one question.—Pray Mr. William Palfrey,—<HI>What are the names of the "Well Disposed" Committee;—Are they the res∣pectable Committee of White-washers?</HI>—This question you surely are able to answer; if, therefore, you should appear in print again, please to answer it honestly.</P>
<P>The repeated attempts that are daily made to place this dispute in a party light, fully display, as I have said before, the weakness of my opponents: if they had not inserted my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their Advertisement of August 14th, they might have gone on their way without interuption from me: after that pub∣lication, no other choice was left, but to give my reasons for declining to sign, to lay before the world a state of the importations, and to show that the underhand behavior of the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> did not agree with their declarations.</P>
<P>The <HI>"well disposed"</HI> are advised to reform before <HI>the Review of the proofs,</HI> and to make an open confession of their devices; they will never be able to justify their conduct to the upright Mechants in this Town and Province, and to the neighbouring Colonies; I would therefore entreat them for their own sake, and for the sake of truth and justice, to condemn all their past unjust proceedings, and fairly to set out on a new, honest, and legal foun∣dation.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Boston, <DATE><HI>October</HI> 9<HI>th,</HI> 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE taking into consideration the long Advertisement of the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> pub∣lished in the Massachusets Gazette or Boston Weekly News-Letter, August 31st, has been delayed till this day, in expectation, that the applications, so often, conferred on them, would have operated more effectually, and in∣duced them, to appear under their own proper names: but, no vestige of hope remain∣ing of their discovering themselves, I shall now proceed to examine it.—The first vessel published is the Snow Pitt, Capt. Tapscott, from Bristol. which arrived here June 1st, 1769, in which the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> say, there were <HI>thirty one Importers, sixteen of whom did not belong here, and of the fifteen who were Inha∣bitants of this Town, only four were signers to the Agreement,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Messieurs Newell, Rowe, Erving and Hubbards; Mr. Newell Imported only Tin and Iron Plates which altho' they were not inserted in the Agreement, yet at the time of entering into the same, it was generally un∣derstood that the Importing of them would not be considered as a breach of the agreement; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="100" REF="011336_0053_0F8580A49DD7B1B8"/>
have since been permitted by on express vote of the Merchants.</HI> It must be plain to every person o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> common discernment, if it had been intended that the importation of Tin and Iron plates, would not be considered as a breach of the agreement, at the time of entering into the same in August 1768, they should have been advertised along with the o∣ther articles allowed: and it is, no doubt, mat∣ter of grief to every man in the same business with Mr. Newell, that this affair so <HI>generally understood</HI> as the <HI>"will disposed"</HI> say, was not made public.—True, they permitted them by an express vote, July 26th, but Mr. Newell's Tin and Iron Plates, unluckily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rived here the first of June preceding that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P>I must ask the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> it this gen∣tleman was a Committee man to procure sub∣scribers to the Non-importation agreement, while he <HI>understood,</HI> even at the time the a∣greement was come into, that they had given him a <HI>dispensation,</HI> which was not made public with the other allowed articles. I wish the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> joy on their exercising a dispensing power; though the world may think they have encroached on the prero∣gative of his Holiness at Rome.</P>
<P>Mr. ROWE <HI>imported only SHOT and LINES which were allowed.</HI> The Articles allowed are always printed in the same paper with the Manifest to make this evident. <HI>The Blan∣kets and Hose were consigned to him for the use of the Army.</HI> It would not have been im∣proper if the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> had mention∣ed the Gentlemen of the Army, who gave the orders for these 12 bales of blankets, &amp;c. and to whom Mr. Rowe delivered them: Or, did <HI>you,</HI> the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> also grant Mr. Rowe, a <HI>dispensation</HI> to import goods under the mark, A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>MY<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for I have good reason to believe, that no such orders were given, nor these goods brought for the army, unless they thought proper to purchase them after they arrived here.</P>
<P>Mr. ERVING <HI>imported some Irish linen and Beer, which were sent for before the agreement was come into, and actually countermanded, but his orders did not arrive in time to revert their being shipped, and he has put them under the care of the Committee.</HI> So, the Irish linen and beer were ordered before the agree∣ment in August 1768; yet the cases of beer were not shipped at Bristol, till March 22<HI>d,</HI> nor the linen till the 10th of April, 1769; by this it would appear, that the let∣ter commissioning these articles, had been very long, indeed, in getting to Bristol, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well as the orders countermanding them.—Well! but now they are come, and <HI>he has put them under the care of the Committee▪</HI> pray how did <HI>you</HI> the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them, and where did you store these packages?</P>
<P><HI>The goods for Messrs. Hubbards were only di∣rected to their care, for Stephen Ayr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t, mer∣chant at Newport.</HI> This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a short, but dis∣tinct account of Messrs. Hubbards goods, and as name and place are mentioned, leaves no room for doubt. I would compliment the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> on this occasion, for being so explicit, a virtue they are not remarkable for; but it is probable, the public are more indebt∣ed to the candour of the gentlemen to whom Mr. Ayrault's goods were consigned, "than to the <HI>well disposed."</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the six importations, that appeared in the manifest, to come consigned to one person, whose name was blotted out, and others inserted, those who furnished Mr. Mein with this manifest, must have known, they were shipped to Philadelphia, and the inserting them in the manner he has done, is base, and could be intended for no other purpose, than to impose on the Public, by insinuating that those goods were for some person or persons here, whose names were secreted.</HI> Certainly, the person, whose name was so carefully blotted out, that it could not be read, ought openly and ho∣nestly to have let the public know, who he was; as well as the time when and the ves∣sel, in which, these six importations, into this port, were shipped for Philadelphia: If the person to whom these goods were consigned, inclines to follow this plan, he will both do a
<PB N="101" REF="011336_0053_0F8580A49DD7B1B8"/>
duty to himself and to the public. It was my duty to the public to mention the con∣tents as expressed in the Cockets: and to give the names which appeared in the manifest, just as they had been written and corrected in <HI>that</HI> sworn to by the master of the vessel. I give the importations from the coc∣kets and manifests; it is every man's business concerned in these importations, to vindicate himself: the Committee ought not to have <HI>"secreted"</HI> either their own names, the name of that <HI>one person</HI> or those of the other importers, <HI>To Order:</HI> Acting in this manner, is both underhand and <HI>"base;"</HI> and they are now after many repeated calls, again sum∣moned to discover themselves.</P>
<P>In the Brigantine Last Attempt; Captain Lyde, which arrived in this port, April 10th 1769. The <HI>"will disposed"</HI> have asserted, <HI>there were no goods but what were allowed ex∣cept one parcel of cheese and ten boxes of Le∣mons belonging to persons who were not signers of the agreement.—nor were there any kind of good<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the signers, except Coals for Mr. Han∣cock, and one case and a matt, consigned Mr. Leverett for the use of a Gentleman; family at Kittery.</HI> The <HI>"well disposed"</HI> should not have <HI>"secreted"</HI> the names of the persons to whom the Cheese and Lemons belonged,—The Public will be compleatly convinced of <HI>the gross fallacy and impudence</HI> of the <HI>well dis∣posed,</HI> to use their own words, on comparing with the Manifest published August, 21st, their positive declaration that nothing contrary to a∣greement was imported in this vessel, in which are to be seen no less than 167 casks and barrels of gunpowder, consigned to different persons, imported here April 10th, 1769; for the vote allowing it, did not pass till the 26th of July following.—Mr. Leverett, being a <HI>signer,</HI> was very unfortunate in serving as a Conveyer for goods imported <HI>for the use of a Gentleman's family:</HI> goods not allowed, and imported for such a purpose, may, with greater propriety be accounted a breach of the non-importation agreement, than those which necessity dic∣tates to bring for common sale: Besides, this Gentleman will have the same excuse to make more than once.</P>
<P>If the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> shall think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to grant <HI>dispensations</HI> to signers for this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of im∣porting, none of them will, for the future, have occasion to use their own names; as their customers may have whatever goods they want imported, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>he cloak for <HI>family use,</HI> and, <HI>each</HI> of the <HI>"well disposed" signers</HI> be as <HI>heretofore</HI> entitled to his usual advance.</P>
<P>Capt. Hood in the Brigantine Lydia, enter∣ed here, April 18th. In this vessel were, ac∣cording to the confession of the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> 17 <HI>Importers in all,</HI> 6 <HI>of whom were not of this town and only two of them were signers, Mr. Hancock and Mr. William B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wes, the former had fifty Chaldron of Coal, and</HI> 100 <HI>pieces of Russia Duck, falsely called British Linen; they latter had a cask of Card Wire, called in the Manifest Wrought Iron.</HI>—Mr. Hancock's importation in this vessel, has been fully cleared up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on my part, by an attested cocket, published the 28th of August; and as to Mr. William Bowes's; Card Wire, it is named in the Cocket, Wrought Iron.</P>
<P>The Brig P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>li, Capt. Hall, arrived at Boston the 10th of June, and the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> con∣fess <HI>in this vessel were twenty three importers five of whom were signers of the agreements, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Messirs. Barrett and Sons, who had a Case, called in Mein's Manifest, for some good reason <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doubt, Turnery, whereas in fact they were and should have been called Wool Cards.</HI> Why did the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> make this mischievous discovery, but perhaps I do them wrong, it might be owing to pure ignorance, not design; however, let the public judge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> There is a duty on Wool Cards exported, which is <HI>"the some good reason no doubt"</HI> why they were entered out, <HI>"Turnerys"</HI> and a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rea∣son</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="011336_0054_0F8580A56520A768"/>
too, as this trifling alteration <HI>"no doubt"</HI> saved the duty.</P>
<P><HI>Messirs</HI> J <HI>and</HI> J. AMORY <HI>who had six packages, being the remains of Household Furniture, part of which came before the agreement was entered into, but these not being ready could not be ship∣ped before.</HI> There are only by the cockets and masters manifest, five packages, which were shipped, at London, the 19th of April, about eight months after the agreement was entered into: but I hope when they arrived they were submitted to the care of the <HI>well disposed:</HI> they are also liable to the same objection as the <HI>Case for the use of a Gentle∣man's family</HI> consigned to Mr. Leverett.</P>
<P>N. WHEATLEY 40 <HI>pieces Russia Duck again falsely called British Linen.</HI> The <HI>well disposed</HI> are very unhappy whenever they arise to positive assertion and strong expressi∣on; for Mr. N. Wheatley's correspondent; en∣tered out at the Custom-house of London, 40 pieces British Linen, in 4 bales, two of them marked A. L. the other two, J. R R. and the bales so marked, are mentioned to be consign∣ed to Mr. Nathaniel Wheatley, in the Mani∣fest sworn to by the master at this port.—If this should be disputed by any of the <HI>well disposed,</HI> and if they sign their names, pro∣per proof will be brought.</P>
<P>Captain DASHWOOD, <HI>a cask, containing some trifles he bought at Vendue in London, va∣lue only</HI> 37<HI>s.</HI> 6<HI>d.</HI>—Captain Dashwood in the Brigantine Deep-bay, arrived at Boston, De∣cember 3d, 1768, after a tedious passage, hav∣ving sailed from London in September: It is very extraordinary, that HE should leave these <HI>trifles</HI> in London till April 1769, instead of bringing them with him in his own vessel.—There is something very arch in this transac∣tion of the Captain's, and the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> have really vouchsafed to make a very satisfac∣tory apology for an under <HI>Committee man.</HI></P>
<P>MELATIAH BOURN, <ABBR><HI>Esq,</HI></ABBR> <HI>six Bundles of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>p, one of the allowed articles.</HI> The ar∣ticles, allowed which are printed along with this manifest, make it fully evident to every reader, that this Gentleman, is entirely clear from any imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tation of importing contrary to agreement: therefore the above need not have been mentioned by the <HI>well disposed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is observed by Mr. Mein that there were some articles taken from the cockets which were not in the manifest, among these were</HI> 36 <HI>hampers of beer,</HI> 20 <HI>of which were really inserted in the manifest, consigned E. Wendell of Portsmouth, and the remaining</HI> 16 <HI>were for sea stores—It is probable no notice would be taken of this but with intent to misrepresent and abuse Mr. Hancock, as the persons wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> furnished this manifest must have known by the cocket that the</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 <HI>pieces of glass, were really bottles of beer, part of which had been used for sea stores, and the remainder were consigned to the gentleman at Portsmouth aforementioned.</HI></P>
<P>Where our ingenious <HI>"well disposed"</HI> dis∣covered the 36 hampers of beer they best can tell; Capt. Wendell's 20 were inserted, they grant; but the other sixteen hampers being neither in the cockets, nor manifest surely could not be inserted in the manifest printed in the Chronicle: the 1300 pieces of green glass, weight, 22cwt. 2qr. 24lb. in packages marked J. H. were not published, with an in∣tent, to misrepresent or abuse any person, and if they had contained beer, it would have been expressed in the cocket: if this is con∣tested by any of the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> who chuses of sign his name, what is here said, shall be properly authenticated.</P>
<P><HI>In the Chronicle of the</HI> 24<HI>th instant, is a very long manifest of the carge by Capt. Calef, in which there appeared to be greater number of importers than in any of the other vessels, but no goods of a∣ny consequence beloning to any merchant here ex∣cept one parcel consigned to a person who has since signed the agreement. The large number of pack∣ages consigned to order were for Capt. Oman, great part of which belonged to persons who have since also acceded to the agreement.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Among the importers in this vessel, only the following gentlemen were signers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jonathan Mason, a Post-Chaise. This was a
<PB N="103" REF="011336_0054_0F8580A56520A768"/>
present to a gentleman in Connecticut, and di∣rected to his care.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. MASON, as the post chaise was a pre∣sent directed to his care, cannot be consider∣ed as an importer: but in our present days of scarcity and oeconomy, I hope the Gentleman to whom it was sent, will convert it into cash, and give the produce to the poor.—It is with great pleasure, I embrace this opportunity of doing justice to Mr. Mason, and although I have examined the importations, in upwards of thirty vessels, his name has never appeared but in the above instance.</P>
<P><HI>Samuel Partridge,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>42 <HI>ells Ticklingburg, call∣ed in the manifest, narrow Germany.</HI></P>
<P>This Tickle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>burgh of Mr. Patridge's, was entered out by his correspondent, at the port of London, by the name of Narrow Germa∣ny.</P>
<P><HI>Thomas Handasyd Peck,</HI> 60 <HI>dozen hatts These were wrote for the</HI> 7<HI>th of July</HI> 1768▪ <HI>before the agreement was come into and expected in the fall and therefore not countermanded.</HI></P>
<P>The 60 dozen Felt Hats, though written for July 7th 1768, were not shipped till Februa∣ry 21st, 1769: but this Gentleman has also to account for <HI>a case of Haberdashery,</HI> shipped Fe∣bruary 25th 1769, which is not even apologiz∣ed for by the <HI>"well disposed."</HI></P>
<P><HI>William Dennie,</HI> 1424 <HI>ells broad Russia Duck allowed.</HI></P>
<P>Called in the Manifest, published in the Chronicle, broad Russia from the Cocket.</P>
<P><HI>J. Leverett, one box—directed to his care, for a Lady, at Kittery.</HI></P>
<P>Liable to the same great objection as the case and the household furniture.</P>
<P><HI>N. Green,</HI> 34 <HI>casks. This was pork sent from hence and not meeting a sale in London, was re∣turned.</HI></P>
<P>Those 34 casks are in the master's manifest, but no contents mentioned, and those was no cocket for them; Now if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>"well disposed"</HI> had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood at making conjurers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dlet me into the mysteries of the art, I might not only have discovered th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to have contained Pork, though the contents were not mention∣ed in the manifest, but might perhaps under their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ition, arrived at such proficiency as not only to delude many by a positive declaration, into a temporary belief without condescend∣ing to proofs, or even without affixing a real name to that declaration, that every package landed in this town, since, the commencement of the Non-Importation agreement, or that may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nded during the continuance there∣of, contained or shall contain only ALLOW∣ED ARTICLES.</P>
<P><HI>P. Hughes, Sundries for an apothecary, allow∣ed to be imported as necessary.</HI></P>
<P>Every one must from hence immediately see <HI>the "gross fallacy and impudence"</HI> of the <HI>well disposed</HI> to use their own words: as <HI>sundries for an Apothecary,</HI> were, on April 19th they day Captain Calef entered here, as much prohibited by the Non importation agree∣ment, as Tea, Glass, Painters Colours, Bibles, Paper or Scotch snuff: Drugs and medicines were indeed allowed July 26th, but not be∣fore: the very words, therefore, of the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> have again given the Public a compleat proof of their exercising a dis∣pensing power, without their having been ei∣ther candid or honest enough to publish it for the benefit of the whole. Beside the Apothe∣cary, there is a bag of Pepper which the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> have carefully avoided men∣tioning; and it is now left for them to in∣form the public, whether it was <HI>generally un∣derstood</HI> at the time the agreement was signed, that the importing <HI>pepper</HI> would not be con∣sidered as a breach of the same, or if it was allowed by way of <HI>dispensation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"Isaac Smith,—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tons hemp, allowed."</HI>—This is evidently shewn by the list of allowed articles printed in the Chronicle.</P>
<P><HI>Cox and Berry, I bundle—containing maga∣zines and pamphlets.</HI></P>

<HEAD>To the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Boston, <DATE><HI>October</HI> 12<HI>th,</HI> 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IN the last Chronicle having reviewed the apologies made by the <HI>"well disposed,"</HI> in their Advertisement dated August 31st, for the signers who appeared to have received good<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>y to agreement, by the Cockets and Manifests, sworn to by the Masters of the Pitt, Last Attempt, Lydia, Paoli, and London Packet, from which, the public will judge, if any persons, according to the phrases of the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> have <HI>"perfidiously departed from their solemn agreement:"</HI> and whether or no, the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> have acted with candour, and integrity, or with <HI>"gross fallacy, and im∣pudence."</HI></P>
<P>I shall now proceed to examine, the re∣maining part of that Advertisement.</P>
<P><HI>In this Manifest</HI> (the London Packet, Cap∣tain C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) <HI>are several casks called cordage, which contain cod lines for the fishery, and are allowed to be imported.</HI></P>
<P>Just 8 casks called Cordage in the Cockets.</P>
<P><HI>This manifest is said to be taken from the cockets—If so, is there not an apparent design to deceive the public, in omitting to mention the contents of the</HI> 34 <HI>casks of pork, consigned Mr. Green, and the</HI> 26 <HI>casks of ditto, consigned Mr. T. Gray? The contents of these casks were undoubt∣edly mentioned in the cockets; and therefore might have been as easily published, as the contents of other packages, if it would have answered the design of the publisher.</HI></P>
<P>It has been already declared there were no Cockets for these casks, and that the Master's Manifest did not express the Contents;—To explain which the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> are refer∣red to the Custom-house.</P>
<P><HI>It is worthy of remark that several packages con∣signed to order, and those that are n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t directed either to order or any particular person in the manifest, were imported by those who refused to come into the agreement, and some to others who have acceded to it since those vessels arrived.</HI></P>
<P>Why did the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> in this Adver∣tisement, <HI>secret</HI> the names of those Impor∣ters of several packages, especially, as they had refused to come into the agreement.—Let the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> print their whole list of Subscribers w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h the date of their signing. It is to be hoped too, that the goods imported by those who have acceded, since the arrival of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se vessels, are all lodged in the Committee's Store.</P>
<P><HI>Many of the consignments which appear to be for Boston, were for persons that do not reside in the town or province.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>"well disposed"</HI> are entreated to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out these many consignments.</P>

<P>The articles to Capt. Oman, and most of the consignments, To Order, have been inserted,
<PB N="111" REF="011336_0058_0F8580A86826D2E8"/>
till the Committee make it appear either that they have these packages in their store, or that they were for some other province, and that no profit acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d from these goods to the persons to whom they were consigned.</P>
<P>On considering the above state of importa∣tions from Great-British into Boston, in <HI>only five vessels,</HI> amounting to upwards of Eleven Hundred Packages, more than <HI>eight hundred</HI> of which were for Gentlemen in the town, and many of the rest, though consigned To Order, can be prov∣ed to have been received by the Merchants here; if the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> chuse to dispute it, and will sign their names. It must appear clear to every reader, that the SOME TRIFLES of the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> when stated impar∣tially, are <HI>trifles</HI> of <HI>considerable value.</HI> And I again beg of them, to give one more proof of their genius, in explaining away the SOME TRIFLES brought in upwards of THIRTY VESSELS even excluding the above five, which have arrived in this port, from Great-Britain, be∣tween January 1st, and the date of their Ad∣vertisement August 31st. 1769.</P>
<Q><P><HI>It is necessary also to acquaint the reader, that the contents of many of the packages are very different from what they</HI> ARE SAID <HI>to contain in the manifest published by Mr. Mein, particular∣ly Russia and English duck are called British li∣nens, small duck is called German linen, and Wool cards are called turnery, &amp;c.—whether these are really called so in the cockets is under∣tain, as the Merchants upon application made to the Custom House Officers have not been per∣mitted to see them, but</HI> we have reason to be∣lieve <HI>they are published in this manner to de∣ceive the public, the committee had all the mani∣fests before them, which they carefully examined and the public may depend on the accounts they have published relating to the several importa∣tions.</HI></P></Q>
<P>With regard to Russia and English Duck, being called British linen, that has been fully cleared up, on my side, by an attested cocket<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and as to the other articles, if the correspon∣dents of some people here chuse to make false entries, the blame must fall upon themselves. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>uppose a certain Gentleman does not want to hear any thing more about <HI>Wool Cards</HI> or <HI>Turnery.</HI></P>
<P>The Public will now be sensible there is great <HI>"reason to believe"</HI> that the long Advertise∣ment of the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> was published with an intention to <HI>deceive,</HI> more so, as they have declared they <Q><HI>had all the Manifests be∣fore them, which they carefully examined.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Of what is said concerning the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> I am authorised to declare, that, if the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> will condescend to mention when the Merchants, as they call themselves, made application, and were refused, and, at the same time, will sign their names to their publication—The Gentleman who sent the note to me, which was published in the Chronicle of September the 8th, will, im∣mediately after, make known his name: and then, what the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> have asserted above, will be proved, to use their own stile, <HI>False.</HI>—This too, will serve as an answer to Mr. William Palfrey, who has fallen into the gross absurdity of <HI>whispering</HI> in a News-paper; a whisper is a private intimation, uttered on∣ly to the person to whom it is addressed, in a low soft voice.</P>
<Q><P><HI>It will therefore be needless, particularly to remark upon every manifest that may be published, but if any thing worthy of observati∣on appears in the course of Mr. Mein's publicati∣ons, it will be properly noticed and explained, and if needful animadverted upon.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Our <HI>"well disposed" Veterans in Deceit,</HI> from the above paragraph, appear now very wil∣ling to be silent, and if they had adopted such a wise resolution before they published the Advertisement under review, they would have shewn much prudence, for then, they would not have made public Deacon Newell's dispensation; Mr. Rowe's importations under the mark ARMY;—Mr. George Erving's

inattention;—Deacon Barretts Wool Cards, "FALSELY" called <HI>Turnery,</HI> no doubt to says the duty:—The several packages for <HI>Fanny Use:</HI> Mr. Wheatley's <Q><HI>Russia Duck <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> British Linnen:</HI></Q>—Capt. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> value 37s. 6d. bought by himself at vendue in London, from whence he failed in Septem∣ber 1768, but <HI>no doubt,</HI> room being w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing for these <HI>Trifles</HI> on board his own vessel, they remained in London, till April 1769, and then were shipped on board the Paoli, Capt. Hall; But above all, the foregoing list of what they call SOME TRIFLES, would not have been at this time held up to the <HI>"well dispos∣ed"</HI> as a looking glass for them to contem∣plate the features of their actions.</P>
<P>The <HI>"well disposed"</HI> if they should think it <HI>needful</HI> to animadvert on the Manifest of the Pratt, Captain Freeman, which ar∣rived here the 13th April 1769, are request∣ed to ask the <HI>Good Deacon William Phillips,</HI> if the 2 casks of <HI>Turnery,</HI> marked W.

<HEAD>To the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Boston, <DATE><HI>October</HI> 15<HI>th,</HI> 1769.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE long Advertisement of the <HI>"well dis∣posed"</HI> published in the Massachusets Gazette, August 31st, having been exposed to public view in the two last Chronicles—the Manifest and Contents of the Packages, im∣ported in the Nassau, Capt. Smith, which en∣tered here August 15th, is now laid before the Public; the reason for altering the mode of publication with regard to this vessel, was the great difficulty found to reconcile the Ma∣nifest with the cockets on comparing them; It was therefore thought best, that mistakes might be avoided, to print both, and by so do∣ing, submit the whole to the penetration of the Reader. The summary and ingenious ac∣count given of this Cargo by the <HI>"well dispos∣ed,"</HI> is as follows: <HI>Boston, Aug.</HI> 28<HI>th.</HI> 1769.</P>
<P>THE Committee appointed to examine the Manifests of the Goods imported in the vessels lately arrived from England, having carefully examined the Manifest of the Car∣go of the Brigantine Nassau, Capt. Smith, hereby inform the public, that all the goods imported in said vessel contrary to the A∣greement of the Merchants belonging to the inhabitants of Boston and Charlestown have been delivered up to the Committee, and put into the Stores provided for that purpose ex∣cept six Chests of Oil, and twenty-one Casks of Figgs and Raisins, marked E. K. the Or∣ders, for which had been countermanded by the person to whom they were consigned, and
<PB N="120" REF="011336_0063_0F8580ACB14B7220"/>
the several packages consigned Messieurs—. who have been and are now advertised as Im∣porters.</P>
<P>The <HI>"well disposed"</HI> are begged to inform the Public, if Mr. Thomas Russel of Charles∣town, is a Signer: and as they have <HI>careful∣ly examined the Manifest</HI> it is wished they would name the Committee to whom <HI>all the Goods imported in said vessel contrary to a∣greement</HI> have been delivered; and hav∣ing said, these Goods were <HI>put into stores provided for that purpose,</HI> it would not be a∣miss, to point out in what part of Boston or Charlestown, these Stores are situated. Or, were they the very Stores of the gentle∣men to whom the Goods were consigned? Are the Packages still unopened? Are the Goods yet unsold?</P>
<P>Most of the Manifests of the vessels which arrived between January 1st, and August 31st, 1769, the date of the vindication of the <HI>well disposed</HI> being now published, it may be conceived, that the public are expecting the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> will make another laudable effort in their own defence, or will they to bo∣row a choice word of theirs, shelter themselves under a general denial, commonly the der∣nier resort of detected <HI>"Impudence."</HI></P>
<P>However, if they should muster brass e∣nough to re-appear, which seems to be a never failing resource with them on all emergen∣cies; their friends ought to beseech them care∣fully to consult their own <HI>"well disposed"</HI> Ad∣vertisement of August 11th, from whence their present self-assumed title originated, and which I have too much respect for them to withold on any occasion: They ought to read the first line—
<Q><HI>"Whereas</HI> ALL <HI>the Well Disposed"</HI></Q>
and immediately after turn to the Review of their Advertisement August 31st, in which, they will see, three several lists of Non-sign∣ers, among whom, are many of the most re∣spectable Gentlemen in the province.</P>
<P>A definition of the Words <HI>"Well disposed"</HI> given by the <HI>Precious Set</HI> themselves certainly would be very entertaining.</P>
<P>And it would indeed be kind in the <HI>"well disposed,"</HI> to give the Public a list of the great and good Qualities requisite to entitle a Candidate to the mighty honour of such an appellation; and in my humble opinion, the best plan to adopt, would be for the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> to publish their Names, that the world might look up or more properly down, and take example.</P>
<P>Also before they proceed to the considera∣tion of the other Thirty Vessels, which arrived preceding the 31st of August and the large importations by them, it would not be improper for them soberly to reflect on what has been published concerning The first Five, which brought upwards of Eleven Hundred Packages for this town, after excluding the <HI>Goods</HI> for <HI>other Provinces,</HI> and every part of this Pro∣vince, except Boston; also the <HI>allo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Goods</HI> of Signers, those for <HI>Family Use,</HI> and those e∣ven brought under the <HI>indulgencies</HI> granted by the <HI>"well disposed."</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>SECOND PART of the CATECHISM of the "WELL DISPOSED." interspersed with some wholesome Advice.</HEAD>
<P>Pray how have you managed with your new recruits?</P>
<P>Are all the goods imported since January
<PB N="121" REF="011336_0063_0F8580ACB14B7220"/>
1st, contrary to agreement, honestly lodged in your stores?</P>
<P>Do you imagine that your new acquisitions have imbibed all your principles, have really consolidated with you, or will they seize the first opportunity to desert?</P>
<P>What are your terms of enlisting? it's thought you have different encouragements suited to the disposition of your Recruits.</P>
<P>Are not some, after having largely supplied themselves, allowed to keep all the goods they have imported, provided they come in?</P>
<P>Have you not prevailed on a few, on ac∣count of the shortness of time till January 1770?</P>
<P>It is said, when you can prevail upon a new Recruit to give up his Goods, you take them into your custody; but is it not also true, that you sometimes give them back again?</P>
<P>Did you ever allow delinquent Signers to keep their Goods in their own Store, on pro∣mise not to open them?</P>
<P>Were not others permitted to carry the Packages to their own Store, open, and sell them, <HI>after having performed the ceremony of submitting them to the direction of the Committee.</HI></P>
<P>And when every other encouragement pro∣ved abortive, did not a bountiful application of <HI>strong scented aromatics,</HI> in part, occasion the desired effect?</P>
<P>Pray was this <HI>natural discovery,</HI> the spontane∣ous production of a single genius among, you, the <HI>"well disposed;"</HI> or did the idea ascend, and diffuse itself universally among you from the <HI>retrograde collisions</HI> of certain well known parts, where it is said, honour chiefly resides.</P>
<P>Had you an unanimous vote for it, at your <HI>private meetings?</HI> did each of you according to the strength of his zeal, proportion the <HI>quantity</HI> and <HI>quality</HI> of his <HI>contribution?</HI>—did not each of you, for that purpose, come properly charged? or upon inspection, find∣ing the collection of matter too small, not withstanding you were so <HI>"well disposed,"</HI> did you, to supply the deficiency, send about a sub∣scription for to multiply the dose? And pray, which of the <HI>Committees</HI> were deputed to per∣form the savoury operation?</P>
<P>But if a second application should be tried, perhaps the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>worthies who administer it, may meet with a gracious reception, and re∣ceive a weightier compliment, in return, though perhaps, one, not to sweetly perfumed.</P>
<P>It has been whispered about, that you have generously given up some goods that were re∣ally once in your possession, with this remark∣able saying, <HI>You know we are never hard upon Signers.</HI> This, the Public have long suspected.</P>
<P>The Public have also had good reason to believe, that some of you, the <HI>"well disposed,"</HI> have been and now are among the greatest de∣linquents.</P>
<P>May <HI>Scotch Snuff</HI> be imported with impunity by any of the <HI>"well disposed."</HI></P>
<P>Would not the life and conversation of some of you, the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> if held up to public view in their true colour, present an ex∣ample, tending greatly to the edification of mankind.</P>
<P>Cannot the <HI>"well disposed,"</HI> give the Pub∣lic a list of of sundries imported under the de∣nomination, <HI>Turnery?</HI></P>
<P>Is it not certain, that you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>"well disposed"</HI> know the names of Importers, To Order, some of whom have not signed, and whose names you have <HI>"secreted."</HI></P>
<P>Did a very good Christian, ever attempt to persuade a Merchant not to fell <HI>Bibles,</HI> as be∣ing contrary to the good of the country?</P>
<P>Was a certain in Chairman ever told, when re∣peatedly pressing a person, who was not a Merchant, to sign, that he should begin to think seriously of it, when he, the said Chair∣man, made a motion from the Chair, to stop the importation of Molasses, from which the greatest revenue was drawn?</P>
<P>Did that Gentleman ever make such a mo∣tion?</P>
<P>Did he ever consult a certain person about writing a <HI>"well disposed"</HI> Advertisement, after being told, that the first and last part of the one be had produced, in writing, contradicted each other.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="011336_0064_0F8580ACDF6C7EA0"/>
Was he not told, that if he meant to pub∣lish the truth, he had no occasion to consult any person? but that not being altogether the point in view, Was he not recomended back to the Committee for their sage assistance? After having by himself, thrice, in vain, attempted to write some thing that would hang together? However it must be confessed, that, after retir∣ing for a day or two, he produced one, which, if not very consistent with truth, was at least nicely fitted for present use.</P>
<P>The same Gentleman, several months ago, once saying that if a certain person stood out, he must be advertised; did not that person repeat an Advertisement to him, extempore, which made him start and shake his ears?</P>
<P>Are the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> ignorant, that e∣ven signers, have sold great quantities of Goods Imported since the Agreement was entered into?</P>
<P>Have any of the <HI>six inattentive signers,</HI> of∣fended more than once?</P>
<P>Do the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> think the public is ignorant, that one of their number, and a Committee-man too, has been a great trans∣gressor, though the signs of grace, which he shewed on a late occasion, entituled him to some mercy.</P>
<P>How many of the Subscribers to the Agree∣ment were never any way concerned in im∣porting British Goods?</P>
<P>At your next meeting, pray exclude all <HI>such,</HI> even though the Chair should be vaca∣ted, and follow a more equitable plan than you have hitherto done?</P>
<P>Would it not be an excellent manoeuvre, on the 1st of January next, to propose giving up the Goods you may have in possession, in or∣der to engage the signers, to prolong the term of their Agreement?—Other Goods you know might be ordered to arrive about the expiration of this second Agreement, especi∣ally if the time should only be six months, and then delivering up these new goods, might again serve as a bait to encourage Signers to lengthen the Agreement to the end of the year. Are not these clever expedi∣ents for you!</P>
<P>The <HI>"well disposed"</HI> are also asked, if they have not piously used all their endeavours, to stop the circulation of a certain pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> through the country, by influencing the people at the different houses where the papers used to be left, to refuse taking them in▪</P>
<P>Have they not also industriously sent to al∣most every town in the province for the same and for <HI>other "well disposed" purposes?</HI> though some Gentlemen in the country, have been so anxious to enquire into, and to propagate the truth, as to point out new methods of con∣veying the <HI>papers</HI> with safety.</P>
<P>Do some Signers retain the privilege of <HI>inattention,</HI> or of digressing and varying from the <HI>allowed</HI> articles as they please: and do the <HI>"well disposed'</HI> still use the Anti christian freedom of granting dispensations and indul∣gencies?</P>
<P>The <HI>"well disposed,"</HI> with their usual con∣fidence, may declare, they despise answering these interrogatories, but the Public will judge with more justice, and conceive it to be incapacity that prevents them.</P>
<P>Though the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> have not yet told the Public their Names, opportuni∣ties have offered of lustily pulling their ears, which have often appeared, with affected briskness, through the gloom that surrounded them; as well as of bestow∣ing repeated applications, which have had a very Prolific effect, on another part, that shall be nameless.</P>
<P>Before you, the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> proceed further in your gradation downwards, it would perhaps be conducive to your future peace, seriously to examine your past lives, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f you think the <HI>hue</HI> of your actions fair e∣nough to suffer the light, you may go on, but perhaps you may bear about in your minds for life, the mortifying and cutting remem∣brance of having slighted this advice.</P>

<P>OF Vessels which arrived in this port be∣tween January 1st, and August 17th, 1769, the date of my first publication, being now printed, it must be evident to every rea∣der, that malice alone, could have instigated the <HI>"well disposed,"</HI> to select me out of such a great number of Non-Signers and Im∣porters.</P>
<P>Every disinterested man on the continent, who has the opportunity of reviewing their transactions, must, now, be convinced of their partiality, and <HI>"Gross fallacy and impudence."</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>"well disposed"</HI> having, as yet, only ventured to apologize for the <HI>first five Mani∣fests,</HI> they are desired to exert their dexteri∣ty, in accounting for the Goods brought in the other vessels.</P>
<Q><P><HI>One</HI> or <HI>two</HI> of the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> and some of their Coadjutors, not Merchants, who have been peculiarly alert behind the curtain in moving the puppets. and, artful as they think they have been in concealing themselves, may yet be dragged out and exhibited to the Public in all their blackness and deformi∣ty.—I shall however soon stop for a few pa∣pers, having finished the Manifests previous to my first publication, on purpose to wait for the vindication of the <HI>"Well Disposed"</HI> which they have given the Public reason to expect; and which they are now again called upon to publish.</P></Q>

<P>Will the good Deacons William Phillips and John Barrett, men of great property, and who are said to have a very large assortment of goods on hand, fell, at the sterling cost and charges to those who used to import, and to Retailers who have no fortune, who have stop∣ped importation, and who have not had it in their power to lay in vast quantities, at a time that some others did, before the Non-importation Agreement: It is asked again, if they will sell to people in these circumstan∣ces, at the sterling cost and charges, in order to preserve them and their families from want?</P>

<HEAD>Catechism OF THE "WELL DISPOSED". PART III.</HEAD>
<P>DID not a certain Committee the last spring declare, that goods for ship building were not meant to be included in the Non-impor∣tation agreement?</P>
<P>In direct opposition to this, have not a ve∣ry <HI>"Well Disposed"</HI> Committee lately asserted, that the above mentioned Committee had no right to make such a declaration, that goods for ship-building were as much excluded as any other article whatever, and that Gentlemen concerned in that branch of trade, ought to inform their correspondents at home, not to send goods for such a purpose?</P>
<P>Which of these Committees are to be believ∣ed?—Why do the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> conceal <HI>a∣ny</HI> of their transactions or resolves! Why are they not published for the information of this town, province and continent?</P>
<P>Is not the building of ships a very great be∣nefit to the tradesmen in this town?</P>
<P>Have not the tradesmen in this town, been principally supported for some years past, by the building of ships for the Merchants of Great Britain?</P>
<P>Will not the prohibition of these articles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end to the almost immediate ruin of that in∣dustrious and valuable part of the communi∣ty?</P>
<P>Were they in a matter that so nearly con∣cerned their interest, and the support of their families, advised with and consulted?</P>
<P>Was a vote, prohibiting such goods, ever passed at any of the Merchants meetings?</P>
<P>Or did the <HI>"Well Disposed"</HI> Committee that went about recruiting, dare to arrogate to themselves such a supreme command over the bread of others, earned with the sweet of the brow, as of their own mere motion, to stop up the channel from whence it flowed; while they themselves fattened in case and plenty?</P>
<P>Will any of the <HI>"Well Disposed"</HI> part with his <HI>red Cloak</HI> and <HI>best white Wig,</HI> to support a family in distress?</P>
<P>Or, for that humane purpose, will they part with the additional advance they have laid on their goods since the commencement of the non-importation agreement?</P>
<P>Have the other sea-port towns in this pro∣vince, stopt the importation of goods for ship-building?</P>
<P>Will not such resolutions force that valuable trade into other channels, or oblige the Bri∣tish Merchants to build their vessels at home?</P>
<P>How many dispensations have the <HI>Well Disposed</HI> granted for the importation of <HI>I∣rish linen from England?</HI></P>
<P>Are the Merchants who import goods for building, entitled to dispensations; Or, are the <HI>"Well Disposed" ashamed</HI> of any longer encroaching on the assumed unchristian pri∣vileges of the Whore of Babylon?</P>
<P>At a late meeting, was there any <HI>new a∣greement</HI> proposed?—Was there a vote pas∣sed, not to import till all the Revenue acts were repealed, and even the <HI>Molasses act?</HI></P>
<P>Was there a large company present when a certain vote passed? or, only between <HI>twenty</HI> and <HI>thirty?</HI></P>
<P>Let us call them <HI>Thirty!</HI> Were they unani∣mous?</P>
<P>When the Gentlemen present were called to sign, did the <HI>first</HI> signer, a worthy deacon, and a very warm supporter of the scheme, say, with the pen in his hand, that he was a∣shamed
<PB N="126" REF="011336_0066_0F8580AE62DCA308"/>
to put down his name, on account of the <HI>small number</HI> of his followers?</P>
<P>Did the <HI>principal Orator</HI> in favour of it, prudently decline signing, saying for excuse, it was well known he did not import any of the prohibited articles?</P>
<P>Have not <HI>several people</HI> signed, on being granted the trifling dispensation of importing every article requisite for carrying on their own branch of business?</P>
<P>How many signed this <HI>new Agreement</HI> at the meeting?—<HI>Were they twenty.</HI></P>
<P>If a few of the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> have taken into their wise consideration, the repeal of the molasses duty, why, to strengthen that resolution, do they not also vote against their importation, for it molasses are not imported, no revenue can be drawn from them?</P>
<P>Pray how many REBUFFS have you, the <HI>well disposed</HI> met with, from former PENITENTS?</P>
<P>Have <HI>you</HI> ever waited upon any refractory Committee-Men?</P>
<P>Did you ever chuse a Committee-Man who was not a signer?</P>
<P>Do the Public begin to suspect, that a cer∣tain scheme, is principally calculated to <HI>crush</HI> all the young Merchants and importers, that the trade may still remain in the hands of <HI>a few grave "well disposed" Dons,</HI> who are be∣lieved to be <HI>exceedingly well</HI> stocked with Goods?</P>
<P>Has not the course of discipline, which the <HI>"well disposed."</HI> have undergone for these two months past, and the advice that has been be∣stowed on them, opened the eyes of the Pub∣lic, to see them in their <HI>true colours?</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> a few days ago, <HI>white-washed</HI> some importers, they surely dis∣played much <HI>"Want of breeding"</HI> in <HI>secreting</HI> their own Names.</P>
<P>From whence does this <HI>"want of breeding"</HI> arise?—Is it the effect of singular modes∣ty of fear?</P>
<P>Pray what is become of the <HI>alert</HI> Committee, consisting of <HI>seven "well disposed"</HI> Gentle∣men, who were to report on the manifests of the vessels as they arrived?</P>
<P>Did one of these <HI>seven Worthies,</HI> who is an excellent <HI>Prompter</HI> behind the curtain prudently on a late occasion, procure another Gentleman to put down his name in his place; or did he previously resign?</P>
<P>Why don't they lay before the public, their <HI>"True Account"</HI> of the cargo of the Brigantine Wolfe, Capt. Bryant, which was entered here, <HI>the third,</HI> and their <HI>"True Account"</HI> of the cargo of the ship Thomas, Capt. Davies, also entered here the 12th <HI>of this month?</HI></P>
<P>Are these seven <HI>"well disposed"</HI> asleep, or lazy, or more cautions, or less, <HI>"well disposed</HI> than <HI>heretofore?</HI></P>
<P>Have not full Eleven Hundred Packages Consisting of</P>

<P>ONE Daniel Bailey, having published a scurrilous advertisement, concerning the settlement of a barter accompt, with me, to which he was <HI>no doubt</HI> prompted by the <HI>"well disposed:"</HI> almost every thing asserted in his Publication being untrue, except my desiring him never to come into any place be∣longing to me.

<P>I here desire every person, in the province, to whom I am indebted, to send me their accompts, and they shall be paid.—And I recommend to all the <HI>"Well Disposed,"</HI> to follow the example.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="article">
<P>As the Advertisement of the <HI>foolish fellow Bailey,</HI> undoubtedly, was published through the instigation of the <HI>"well disposed",</HI> as well as his behaviour which preceded it, occasioned by their sage advice, I not choosing to re∣main in their debt, for the entertainment of the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> of the present day, and for the benefit of <HI>their Posterity</HI> after them Advertise The following Lives and Characters, which shall be printed <HI>with every proper decora∣tion,</HI> as soon as the <HI>"well disposed"</HI> have sub∣scribed a sufficient quantity of abuse.</P>

<P>Mr. William Palfrey's charge of plagia∣rism will appear an untruth to every person who reads the story of the two Travellers:—I did not give it as may production, not do I lay claim to a single word of it.</P>
<P>I undertook to give the public a state of the importations into Boston, from the cockets and manifests, sworn to by the masters of the vessels: when therefore it appears by the cockets that a packages contains broad Russia linen, I am obliged to give it that name, whe∣ther it be Ravens Duck or any thing else, nor could I without the power of divination, dis∣cover that a bale entered out Broad Russia Li∣nen, contained Ravens Duck, and more, than that a cask entered out <HI>Turnery,</HI> contained <HI>Wool Cards.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Hancock being now returned to this town, I imagine he will not be very ready to thank his Clerk, for his publications; in which, abuse and impudence, supply the place of argument.</P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding his imprudence with regard to him, and his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urrility to me, I shall be extremely glad to hear, that his matter has raised his wages a hundred pounds Old Tenor a year.</P>
