<HEAD>Thursday, January ninth, 1794.</HEAD>
<P>The Senate sitting for the purpose of trying an impeachment—</P>
<P>John Nicholson, Comptroller General of the commonwealth of Pennsylva∣nia, having been summoned by the Senate to come forth and appear at the bar of the Senate, "and answer sundry articles of impeachment exhibited against him by the House of Representatives, in their name, and that of all the people of Pennsylvania, for high crimes and misdemeanors in the discharge of his official duties as Comptroller General of the commonwealth of Penn∣sylvania," appeared at the bar of the Senate.</P>
<P>Whereupon,</P>
<P>The Clerk of the Senate read "the articles of impeachment" as follow, <HI>to wit,</HI></P>
<DIV3 TYPE="articles">
<HEAD>"Articles of accusation and impeachment for high misdemeanors against John Nicholson, Comptroller General of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, by the House of Representatives of the said commonwealth, in their name, and in the name of the People of Pennsylvania, exhibited to the Senate thereof.</HEAD>
<P><HI>"Article</HI> I. THAT, by an act of the General Assembly of this common∣wealth, passed on the twenty-seventh day of March, in the year 1789, entitled, "An act to repeal so much of any act or acts of Assembly of this commonwealth, as directs the payment of the New-Loan debt, or the interest thereof, beyond the first day of April next, and for other purposes therein mentioned," it was, among other things, declared and enacted, That so much of every act or acts of General Assembly as directed or secured the payment of the principal sum or sums mentioned in certain certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates (which had been issued in pursuance of a preceding act, passed on the first day of March, 1786) or the interest thereof, beyond the term of four years, should be thenceforth repealed and made null and void; thereby rendering the said certificates no longer a debt, or evidence of a debt, due and owing from the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pennsylvania: But, nevertheless, John Nicholson, the Comptroller General of this commonwealth, to promote and procure his own emolument, under the colour of his office, pretending as well to facilitate the execution of certain acts of Congress hereinafter mentioned, touching a loan proposed by the United States to the creditors of the respective states, as to carry into effect a certain act of the General Assembly of this commonwealth, herein∣after also mentioned, touching the redemption of certain debts due and owing from the state of Pennsylvania, did, at various times, after the passing of the said act of the sixth day of March, 1789, <HI>to wit,</HI> between the tenth day of April, 1792, and the first day of August, 1792, recognize, certify,
<PB N="5" REF="027484_0004_0FD454817A1CDC90"/>
and declare the said certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, to be subscribable, as debts due and owing by the state of Pennsylvania, to a certain loan opened and proposed, on the part of the United States, to the creditors of the respective states, in and by two several acts of Congress, passed, respectively, on the fourth day of August, 1790, and on the eighth day of May, 1792; thereby committing a high misdemeanor, contrary to the intent and meaning of the said law, passed on the twenty-seventh day of March, 1789, in violation of the confidence reposed in him as a public officer, and manifestly, as the said John Nicholson well know, to the risque and injury of the commonwealth.</P>
<P><HI>"Article</HI> II. That, by an act of the General Assembly, entitled, "An act to provide for paying and redeeming certain public debts, and for defraying the expences of government," passed on the tenth day of April, 1792, pro∣vision was made, among other things, for redeeming certain debts then due and owing by this commonwealth; in the specification of which debts the said certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, were not included, nor could they, in any wise, be contemplated to be objects of the said redemp∣tion; but, nevertheless, the said John Nicholson, the Comptroller General of this commonwealth, with a view to promote and procure his own emolu∣ment, and under colour of his office, did recognize, certify, and declare the said certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificate?, to be redeemable; thereby committing a high misdemeanor, contrary to the terms, intent, and meaning of the said act of the General Assembly, passed on the tenth day of April, 1792, in violation of the confidence reposed in him as a public officer, and to the manifest loss and injury of this commonwealth.</P>
<P><HI>"Article</HI> III. That the said John Nicholson, the Comptroller General of this commonwealth, with intent to promote and procure his own emolu∣ment, and in order to avoid discovery and detection in so doing, until such emolument was actually reduced into his own possession, did not consult the Register General touching the above transactions, nor communicate the same to the Governor; nor did he discriminate, in the certification entered upon the face of the abstracts of debts respectively, by which certification he re∣cognized and declared the said certificates, commonly called New-Loan cer∣tificates, to be subscribable to the said loan opened and proposed on the part of the United States, to the creditors of the respective states, nor in the cer∣tification by which he recognized and declared the same to be redeemable under the said act of the tenth day of April, 1792, between the said certifi∣cates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, and other certificates which were properly debts, or evidences of debts, due and owing from this state, and as such might lawfully be subscribed to the said loan, and redeemed by virtue of the said act of the tenth of April, 1792: in which conduct the said Comptroller General committed a high misdemeanor, in as much as, thereby, all the checks of office, provided by law, were destroyed, the other officers of government were deluded into error, and the commonwealth suffered manifest loss and injury.</P>
<P><HI>"Article</HI> IV. That, by the constitution of this commonwealth, it is de∣clared, that no money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of a previous appropriation by law; yet the said John Nicholson, with a view to promote and procure his own emolument, did, under colour of his office, and in the above mentioned delusive manner, certify to the Governor,
<PB N="6" REF="027484_0005_0FD45482B94DEC00"/>
that certain debts, including the said certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, but not naming or describing the same, were redeemable and payable, when no fund was, by law, provided for paying the same; thereby committing a high misdemeanor, misleading the other officers of government, and causing money, without a previous appropriation, to be drawn from the treasury in violation of the constitution.</P>
<P><HI>"Article</HI> V. That the said John Nicholson, Comptroller General of the commonwealth, with intent to promote and procure his own emolument, and having formed a plan to cause, under colour of his office, the said certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, to be redeemed, did, by himself or his agents, between the tenth day of April and the first day of August, 1792, purchase a very great amount of the said certificates, as well from persons who came to exchange the same at his office, in pursuance of a pro∣vision for that purpose contained in the said act of the twenty-seventh of March, 1789, as from others; which certificates, so purchased, were after∣wards actually redeemed and paid for at the treasury; thereby committing a high misdemeanor, rendering his official trust subservient to the purposes of speculation, and injuring the reputation, as well as the interest, of the com∣monwealth whose officer he was.</P>
<P>"And the said House of Representatives, by protestation, saving to them∣selves the liberty of exhibiting at any time hereafter, any other accusation or impeachment against the said Comptroller General, and also of replying to the answers that the said Comptroller General shall make unto the said articles or to any of them, and of offering proof of the said premises or any of them, or of any other impeachment or accusation that shall be exhibited by them as the case shall require, do demand that the said John Nicholson, Comptroller General of this commonwealth, may be put to answer all and every the pre∣mises, and that such proceedings, examinations, trial and judgment may be upon him had and used as is agreeable to the constitution and laws of this commonwealth, and the said House of Representatives are ready to offer proof of the premises, at such time as the Senate of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall appoint.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="articles">
<HEAD>"Additional articles of impeachment against John Nicholson, Comptroller General.</HEAD>
<P><HI>"Article</HI> VI. THAT the said John Nicholson, Comptroller General of this commonwealth, being intrusted by the aforesaid act, entitled, "An act to repeal so much of any act or acts of Assembly of this commonwealth, as directs the payment of the New-Loan debt, or the inte∣rest thereof, beyond the first day of April next, and for other purposes therein mentioned," passed the twenty-seventh of March, 1789, to receive the said certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, from the per∣sons holding the same, and to re-deliver, to such persons, the certificates of debts, due by the United States, loaned to this state, did, in the execution of the trust so in him reposed, receive, from sundry persons, certain certifi∣cates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, to be exchanged as aforesaid; whereby, and by virtue of the said act of Assembly, the said certificates became the property of this commonwealth, and ought to have been deli∣vered, by him, to the Register General, for the purpose of being cancelled
<PB N="7" REF="027484_0006_0FD4548464218EB8"/>
and preserved; yet the said John Nicholson, then being Comptroller Gene∣ral of this commonwealth, well knowing the same to be the property of the commonwealth, but contriving and intending to convert certain of the same certificates to his own use and emolument, did, between the tenth day of April, 1792, and the first day of August, 1792, unlawfully, and con∣trary to the duties of his office and the trust so as aforesaid in him reposed, subscribe the last mentioned certificates to the loan aforesaid, proposed by the United States to the creditors of this state, in his own name and for his own use and benefit; whereby the said John Nicholson hath committed a high misdemeanor, in the violation of the trust and confidence by this commonwealth in him reposed, and manifestly tending to the injury and loss of the said commonwealth.</P>
<P><HI>"Article</HI> VII. That the said John Nicholson, Comptroller General of this commonwealth, being intrusted, by the aforesaid act, entitled, "An act to repeal so much of any act or acts of Assembly of this commonwealth, as directs the payment of the New-Loan debt, or the interest thereof, beyond the first day of April next, and for other purposes therein mentioned," passed the twenty-seventh day of March, 1789, to receive the said certificates, com∣monly called New-Loan certificates, from the persons holding the same, and to re-deliver to such persons the certificates of debts due by the United States, did, in the execution of the trust so in him reposed, exchange, for sundry persons, certain certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, by receiving, of the said persons, the said New-Loan certificates, and delivering, in return thereof, an equal amount in the certificates of debts due by the United States; whereby, and by virtue of the act of Assembly in such case made and provided, the said New-Loan certificates became the property of this commonwealth, and ought to have been delivered to the Register General to be cancelled and preserved: yet the said John Nicholson, then being Comp∣troller General of this commonwealth, well knowing the premises, but con∣triving and unlawfully intending to convert certain of the same certificates to his own use and emolument, and by subscribing the same to the loan aforesaid, by the United States proposed, to procure the amount thereof to be paid to him by this commonwealth, did, between the first day of April, 1792, and the first day of August, 1792, unlawfully, and contrary to the duties of his said office and the trust so as aforesaid reposed in him, subscribe the said last mentioned certificates, commonly called New-Loan certificates, to the said loan proposed by the United States, in his own name and for his own use and benefit; and did afterwards apply for, and obtain, the amount thereof to be paid by the Treasurer of this commonwealth to his use; whereby the said John Nicholson hath committed a high misdemeanor, hath violated the trust and confidence so as aforesaid in him reposed, and hath occasioned great loss and detriment to this commonwealth."</P>
