<HEAD>To draw up a Regiment and form a Battalion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Companies being in the Field, let the Signal for marching be this; the front Rank of the Colonel's Company advance eight or ten paces and fire; upon which all the Com∣panies instantly are to be upon the March, and fall into the Rear of the Colonel's Com∣pany, as their Posts will be after the Battalion is formed, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Major's Company falling in∣to the Rear of the Colonel's; the Company that carries two Spots or Balls in their Colours in the Rear of the Major's; all the Compa∣nies that carry the even Spots in their Colours falling in immediately one after another; then the Companies whose Colours carry the odd Spots or Balls fall in beginning with the high∣est number; the Company carrying but one Ball falling in immediately before the Lieut. Colonel's Company, which Company brings up the Rear.</P>
<P>They all March to the Ground on which the Battalion is to be formed: After which they are to keep their Facing till the Word is given to Form the Battalion, which is done by Wheeling
<PB N="2" REF="003633_0003_100238A622173028"/>the Divisions; but before this Word is given, and that they may be exact in performing the same observe to close your Ranks of each Divi∣sion to close order, then measure the length of your Ranks and the distance between your Di∣visions, and proportion the same.</P>
<P>Immediately upon the Battalions being Formed, the <HI>Lieutenants,</HI> must place them∣selves on the Right of their Captains, the <HI>Ensigns</HI> on their Left towards the Flanks of the Companies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Serjeants</HI> are to form themselves in the Rear of the Rear Rank four paces distant.</P>
<P>The <HI>Drummers</HI> are to March thirty paces in the Front, when the Drum-major is to form them into a Rank entire opposite to the Center and Facing the Battalion, in which Position the whole is to remain till the Major orders the Offi∣cers to their Posts.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD><HI>OFFICERS</HI> Posts in Review.</HEAD>
<P>THE Word of Command being given, <HI>Officers take your Posts in Battalion.</HI> The eldest Captain is to place himself on the Right of the Battalion; the second Captain on the Left, the third Captain on the Left of the eldest; and so it is with the Lieutenants according to the date of their Commission to the Right and Left; the Ensigns with Colours they govern themselves according to their Companies and not Commissi∣ons,
<PB N="3" REF="003633_0004_1002388E59EB25A8"/>all forming a Rank entire about two good paces before the Front Rank of Men, &amp; to divide the Ground equally between them so as to cover the Front of the Battalion. There must be a Serjeant placed on the Right and Left Flank of each Rank, who are to dress them as often as occasion serves.</P>
<P>The rest of the Serjeants continuing in the Rear are to Range themselves about four paces from the Rear Rank of Men.</P>
<P><HI>Drummers Post.</HI> The Drummers are to be divided into three Divisions, the first upon the Right of the Colonel's Company, the second on the left of the Lieutenant Colonel's Company, and both to dress in a Line with the Front Rank; the third division of Drummers are to Post themselves in the Rear of the Ensigns in the Center.</P>
<P>The <HI>Colonel</HI>'s <HI>Post.</HI> When the Battalion is drawn up, the Colonel's Post is in the Center, and about four paces before the Ensigns with Colours.</P>
<P><HI>Lieutenant Colonel's Post.</HI> The Lieutenant Colonel's Post is a little to the Left of the Colonel's, and about three paces from the Rank of Officers. When there is no <HI>General</HI> to Re∣view, the <HI>Colonel</HI> does not take his Post at the Head of the Battalion, but remains in the Front without taking his Half Pike in his Hand, to give the <HI>Major</HI> the necessary Orders about the Ex∣ercise, &amp;c. In this case, the <HI>Lieutenant Colonel</HI> is to Post himself at the Head of the Battalion with his Half Pike in his Hand: but if the <HI>Colonel</HI> is Absent, He is then in every Article to Personate the <HI>Colonel,</HI> the sole Command de∣volving
<PB N="4" REF="003633_0005_1002388031EB2108"/>on Him. Immediately upon notice given that the <HI>General</HI> is a coming, the <HI>Major</HI> is to order the Soldiers to Shoulder their Arms, from which Position they are always to Rest their Arms when the Compliment is to be paid, and as soon as He approaches near the Right Flank, the <HI>Major</HI> is to order the Soldiers to Rest their Arms, by the following Word of Com∣mand.</P>
<P><HI>To the Front Present your Arms.</HI></P>
<P>At the performing the last Motion of the above command, all the <HI>Drummers</HI> are to beat a March, and the <HI>Major</HI> is immediately <HI>to take his Post on the Right of the Battalion,</HI> and the <HI>Adjutant</HI> on <HI>the Left of the Battalion, dressing in a Line with the Rank of Officers.</HI> As the <HI>General</HI> passes along the Front, the <HI>Officers</HI> are <HI>to Salute</HI> Him with their Half Pikes or Partisans, and to time it in such a manner, that each may just finish his Salute and pull off his Hat, when the <HI>General</HI> comes opposite to him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ensigns</HI> are to drop their Colours, bring∣ing the spear pretty near the Ground, just when the Colonel drops the point of his Half Pike, pulling off their Hats at the same time, and not to raise the Colours till the <HI>General</HI> has passed them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Major</HI> and <HI>Adjutant</HI> being on Horse∣back are to Salute with their Swords, and when the <HI>Major</HI> has finished his Salute, He is to re∣pair opposite to the Center of the Regiment, that he may be ready to order the Men to Face when the <HI>General</HI> goes round the Battalion. And when the <HI>General</HI> comes to either outward Angle, the Drums are to cease Beating, other∣wise
<PB N="5" REF="003633_0006_1002388202393AA8"/>the Major would not be heard when the Word was given for Facing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Serjeants</HI> in the Rear are to pull off their Hats without bowing their Heads when the <HI>General</HI> passes them, holding their Halberd in their Hand, as the Officers do their Half Pikes without bowing their Heads.</P>
<P>When the Battalion is ordered to Face, the Officers, Serjeants and Drummers are to do the same: and all to remain at their Posts, with∣out going through the Battalion to the Rear, when the <HI>General</HI> passes along, or Salute Him any more than once standing: Indeed there should never be but two Salutes paid to the same Person in one Day, <HI>viz.</HI> a Standing and Marching one.</P>

<HEAD><HI>OFFICERS</HI> Posts in Exercise.</HEAD>
<P>AS soon as the Ceremony of Viewing the Regiment is over, the General then ac∣quaints the Colonel what he would have per∣formed. And the General for the most part orders the Manual Exercise to be performed; then to go thro' some part of the Firings, and lastly to March by Him either in grand division, sub-divisions or single Company's.</P>
<P>In time of Exercise, all the Commission Offi∣cers, as also the Lieutenant Colonel's Post, is in the Rear of the Battalion, the Officers eight Paces in the Rear of the Serjeants, the Lieu∣tenant
<PB N="6" REF="003633_0007_100238854F419FD8"/>Colonel four paces behind them, the Serjeants on the Flanks are to March in a di∣rect Line to the Front, and as soon as the two Serjeants who were placed on the Flanks of the Front Rank have Marched forty paces, they are to stand; on which the other Ser∣jeants are to do the same: the Serjeants must take care to divide the Ground on the Flanks equally amongst them The <HI>Drummers</HI> are to March and form themselves into a Rank entire behind the Major. The method of per∣forming this is, in the following manner, first, The Major is to direct the orderly Drummer to beat a Ruff to give the Officers notice, after that a Flam or double Stroak upon which the Lieutenant Colonel, and the rest of the Officers face to the Right about on their left Heels.</P>
<P>At the second Flam they are to advance their Half Pikes, and the Serjeants their Halberds. At the third Flam, the Officers, Serjeants, &amp; the three Division of Drummers are all to March to their Posts, beginning with the Left feet. The Officers are to March thro' the Battalions to their Posts before mentioned and to stand: When the Major finds that all are in their proper Posts of Exercise, he is to order to another Flam to be beat, at which the Officers and Drummers are to face to the Left about on their Left Heels.</P>
<P>The Serjeants on the Right Flank are to face to the Left on their Left Heels. The Serjeants on the Left Flank are to face to the Right on their Right Heels. As soon as they have faced the Officers are to plant their Half Pikes, the Ensigns their Colours, and the Serjeants their Halberds on their Right, in which Position they
<PB N="7" REF="003633_0008_10023888DBD0D1B0"/>are to remain till they are ordered to their for∣mer Post after the Exercise is over. The Drum∣mers are to have their Drums always braced and slung during the whole time the Battalion is under hands.</P>
<P>As soon as the Exercise is over, the Officers, Serjeants and Drummers are to be ordered to their Posts in the following manner: First a ruff of Drum to warn them, then a Flam at which the Officers advance their Half Pikes, the Ensigns their Colours, and the Serjeants their Halberds: After which the Serjeants on the Right Flank are to face to the Left on their Left Heels, and the Serjeants on the Left are to face to the Right on their Left Heels: At the second Flam they are all to March to their former Posts, and as soon as they have got there the Major orders a third Flam to be beat, at which the Officers plant Half Pikes, and the Ensigns their Colours, and the Serjeants and Drummers are to face to the Left about on their right Heels: After which the Serjeants plant their Halberds.</P>
<P><HI>Observe,</HI> when the Officers are ordered to take their Posts of Exercise which is in the Rear, the Colonel is not to go to the Rear, but to March strait forward and place himself by the General, with his Half Pike in his Hand during the Exercise; and as soon as the Officers are ordered to the Front he is to take his Post. When the Command falls to the Major by the absence of the Colonel or Lieut. Colonel, al∣tho' he is to take the Colonel's Post at the Head of the Regiment, and salute with his half Pike, yet when the Regiment is to perform the Ex∣ercise he is always to do it on Horse-back,
<PB N="8" REF="003633_0009_1002388C0120C9B0"/>even the Command of a Regiment not being sufficient to excuse him from that part of his duty before a General.</P>
<P>In the absence of the Field Officers the El∣dest Captain takes the Command, and acts in every respect as the Colonel would have done were he present.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="directions">
<HEAD><HI>OFFICERS</HI> to your Platoons.</HEAD>
<P>IN dividing the Battalion into Platoons, they should be composed of an equal number of Files, or at least not above one File stronger than another, and those should be on the Flanks and Colour Platoons. As soon as the Platoons are told off there must be an Officer appoint∣ed to each to command them, taking an equal proportion of Captains and Lieutenants and Ensigns if any there be that carry half Pikes, for the purpose. The Lieut. Colonel with the remaining part of the Officers are to March and Post themselves in the Rear of the Battalion, in the same manner as they do at Exercise; the Captain, Lieutenant &amp; Ensign with Half Pikes that have not Platoons drawing up into one Rank in the Rear of the Serjeants, and the Lieut Colonel in the Rear of the Officers, and opposite to the Colour Platoon. The Serjeants should be di∣vided to the several Platoons, and Posted in the Rear of the same. The Colonel and the Ensigns with the Colours remain in their former Posts at the head of the Battalion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003633_0010_10020208121F1D48"/>
There are many reasons for there being some Officers Posted in the Rear, I shall mention only two. They are of great Service in leading the Battalion off in order when they are command∣ed to retire. Again, should there be no Officers in the Rear when the Battalion is ordered to the Right about, the Men would be apt to March off too fast, and by that means break their Ranks, and fall into Confusion, or not halt in due time; which inconveniencies are prevented by Officers being there.</P>
<P>The Battalion being prepared to Fire by Pla∣toons, the Officers that command them are to place themselves to the Right and Left of their Platoons facing towards the Colours thus; the Officers to the Right of the Colours are to place themselves to the Right of their Platoons, and the Officers to the Left on the Left of their Pla∣toons, being only advanced a short pace towards the Front Rank of Men.</P>
<P><HI>Posting Drummers.</HI> The two Division of Drummers on the Right and Left are to Post themselves on the Flanks and dress in a Line with the Front Rank of Men, and the Center Division of Drummers are to be Posted before the Colour Platoons, which Drummers are to move to the Right and Left when those Platoons Fire. After they have Fired and Loaded then they are to return as they were, at the same time the <HI>Colonel</HI> Colours and Haut boys (if any there be) are to move to the Right and Left, and as soon as the Colour Platoons have Fired, are to return to their former Posts; but when the Bat∣talion Fires together, the Colours must then fall into the Intervals on the Right and Left of
<PB N="10" REF="003633_0011_10023890C61B81D0"/>the Colour Platoon; supposing there be but two or three Colours to a Regiment, as is the case in the Regiments abroad; but since in the Regi∣ments among us there is a Colour to each Com∣pany; for the same reason that in the Regiments abroad, when the Battalion Fires together, the Colours are to fall into the Intervals on the Right and Left of the Colour Platoon; Why may not our Colours fall into the Intervals on the Right and Left of the other Platoons, as well as the Colour Platoons?</P>
<P>The last part of the Ceremony of Reviewing, is, that of Marching by the General, either by Grand division, Sub divisions, or single Com∣pany's.</P>
<P>When a Battalion is divided into three equal Parts each Division is then called a Grand divi∣sion: Sub-divisions are sormed by dividing each Grand-division into three, four or five equal parts, according to the number of Files in each Grand division, the Regiment being three deep, the Sub-divisions then form Platoons.</P>
<P>By Companies, is the Marching each Compa∣ny by it self, with its own Officers, Serjeants and Drummers.</P>
<P>Before the Regiment Marches off, the Files are to be Closed either to the Right, Left or Center; after which the Ranks are to the Closed to close order, and then ordered to Wheel by Grand or Sub division. Upon the Ranks being Closed, the Officers are to fall back on the heads of their several Divisions.</P>
<P>When they are to March by Grand Divisions they are to March in the followiog order,
<LIST>
<PB N="11" REF="003633_0012_100238925341CF40"/>

<ITEM>3. The Staff Officers, <HI>viz</HI> Chaplain, Adjutant, Quarter-Master, Surgeon and Mate.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Haut-boys in a Rank.</ITEM>

The Serjeants are to be divided equally to three Grand-divisions, and to March on the Right and Left Flanks, if the Regiment is three deep the Drummers are to fall in be∣tween the first &amp; second of each Grand-division; If the Regiment is six deep, then the Drummers are to fall in between the third and fourth Rank of each Grand-division. The Battalion in March∣ing off are to open to their former distance four paces, for which end the Rear Ranks are not to move till those in their Front have got to their proper distance. In Marching, the Major is to Salute on Horse-back, unless he commands the Regiment, which if he does, he is to March on Foot, and in the Colonel's Post, and Salute with his Half-Pike.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003633_0013_100238956DD55278"/>
Paying the Salute. The Officers are to March with their Half Pikes downwards, and when they come within twenty Paces of the General, they are to bring them to their Shoulders, and to time their Salutes so as to finish and pull off their Hats a little before they come opposite to him. All the Officers who March in the same Rank are to be very exact in performing their Motions together; the Motions may be taken from the Officer that Marches on the Right. After the Officers have Saluted, they are not to Bow their Heads in passing by the General, but to March with their Hats off, till they have pas∣sed him about eight paces, and then to put them on; and when they have got twenty paces from the General, they are to reduce their Pike. The Ensigns are to carry the Colours advanced, and to drop thein when the other Ensigns drop the Spears of their Half Pikes, supposing there be such to the Regiment thus Marching, and to March with the Colours down till they have passed the General about six or eight paces. They are to pull off their Hats when they drop their Colours, and not put them on till they have Marched eight paces. The Serjeants are to March with their Halberds on their left Shoulder, hold∣ing the Spears in their Left Hands, and in pas∣sing by the General only to pull off their Hats not Bowing.</P>
<P>The Grand Divisions being subdivided, if the Battalion is to March by Subdivisions, the Officers March as follows. After the Colonel, all the Captains on the Right Wing at the Head of the first Sub-division the Lieutenants of that Wing, are to be divided on and to lead, the remaining

</LIST>
The Field Officers are to March at the Head of their own Company's as Captains. The Staff Officers &amp; Hautboysal ways to March before the Colonel's Company. The Hatchet Men may fall into their Ranks or March before the Captains. After you have Marched to the Ground on which you intend to draw up and have actually so done, the Colonel gives Orders to lodge the Colours, and dismiss the Battalion; the Colours are Lodged in the fol∣lowing manner; but as it may not be unaccep∣table to give an account of the method observed in Regiments Abroad of bringing the Colours to the Regiment. I shall first give an account of that.</P>
<P>The Officers having taken their Posts in the Front of the Battalion, the Major is to order one of the Gra∣nadiers to beat the Drummer's Call, upon which the Ensigns who are to carry the Colours and the Drum major, with one half or two thirds of the Drummers are to repair to the Head of the Com∣pany of Granadiers, where the Drummers are to be formed into Ranks in the Rear of the Ensigns facing outward. A Lieutenant, two Serjeants and twenty four Granadiers are to March with the Ensigns and Guard, the Colours to the Regi∣ment who are generally taken from the Left of the Company, and March with their Firelocks rested on their left Arm and without fixing their Bayonets till they receive their Colours.</P>
<P>The word of Command to the Granadiers are as follows, 1. Poise your Firelocks; Rest your Firelocks on your left Arms. When this is done the Lieutenant places himself two paces before
<PB N="15" REF="003633_0016_1002389BE36A73B8"/>the Ensigns and Marches to the Colonel's Quar∣ters, or place where the Colours are lodged. The Drummers with the Drum major at their Head marching in the Rear of the Ensigns, beat the Throop, and the Granadiers four in Rank march immediately after the Drummers, one Serjeant marches on the Right Flank of the Guard and the other in the rear of the Rear Rank with their Halberds advanced. Note, on sending for the Colours the Compliment then paid by the Battalion is that of Shoulder'd Arms; but when the Colours are brought to the Regi∣ment they are received with rested Arms, and the Drummers who remain beat a March, which is the reason that one third of the Drummers at least remain with the Battalion. The same Com∣pliment is paid to the Colours when they are sent from the Battalion; but when the Ensigns go for the Colours and return without them the Batta∣lion is only to be Shoulder'd. As soon as the Lieutenant comes to the place where the Co∣lours are lodged, he is to draw up his Detach∣ment three deep, and then order the Granadiers to fix their Bayonets, as follows: Poise your Firelocks; Rest on your Arms; Draw your Bayonets; Fix your Bayonets; Recover your Arms; Rest your Firelocks on your left Arm. After these Motions are performed the Ensigns are to take the Colours, &amp; the Lieutenant marches back to the Battalion, in the same order that he came from it, the Ensigns carrying their Co∣lours advanced and letting them fly.</P>
<P>As soon as the Lieutenant comes to the Batta∣lion, he must draw up his Detachment on the Right or Left Flank (according to which Flank
<PB N="16" REF="003633_0017_1002389F05ED0B48"/>he comes to first) and halt his Men; but the Ensigns with the Colours followed with the Drummers are to move on till they have ad∣vanced a little before the Officers of the Batta∣lion, and then Wheel to the Right or Left in∣ward according to the Flank they are on, and March along the Front of the Officers till they come to their Posts in the Center, which they are to fall into. When the Ensigns fall into their Posts, the Drum major is to Wheel the Drum∣mers to the Front and March them about ten paces forward, then Halt, and after he has or∣dered them to cease Beating, he is to send them to their respective Posts.</P>
<P>When the Ensigns with the Colours, and the Drummers have wheeled inwards, in order to March to the Center, the Lieutenant is to order the Granadiers to Face to the Right (if they are drawn on the Left of the Battalion) and march along the Ranks to their former ground; the Lieutenant with the Front Rank of Granadiers marching between the Officers and Front Rank of the Battalion; but if they are drawn up on the Right of the Granadier Company, he is then to face his Detachment to the Left and march it a∣long the Front of the Granadiers only, and as soon as they come on their former Ground, he is to order them to Halt and immediately pro∣ceed to unfix the Bayonets.</P>
<P>After this the Major is to order the Battalion to Shoulder their Arms. As soon as the Colours are sent back, as the Military phrase is, the Drum∣mers Call is to be beat at the Head of the Gra∣nadiers; on which the Ensigns with the Colours, and the Drum-major with the same number of
<PB N="17" REF="003633_0018_100238A09125FFD8"/>Drummers are to repair thither immediately, and draw up as before. The Lieutenant of Grana∣diers are to order the same Detachment, or an equal number of Granadiers to fix their Bayonets and rest them on their left Arms; and as soon as the Major has ordered the Battalion to <HI>Present their Arms,</HI> he is to March back the Colours to the place where they are to be Lodged, the Drummers Beating the Troop as before. The Ensigns are to carry the Colours back in the same manner they brought them, that is, advanced and flying; and as soon as they arrive at the place, and the Detachment is drawn up, they are to furl their Colours and lodge them. When this is done, the Lieutenant is to order the Granadiers to unfix and return their Bayo∣nets, and rest their Firelocks on their left Arms; after which he is to March back in the same manner he carried the Colours to the Bat∣talion, unless he is ordered to dismiss his Men as soon as the Colours are lodged; in which case when the Bayonets are returned in stead of presenting, he is to order them to rest their Fire∣locks, then Club and dismiss them with the Ruff of a Drum.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="directions">
<P>PErhaps it may not be amiss to give some Ge∣neral Rules respecting the several Distances of Ranks in drawing up a Regiment, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The several Distances of Ranks in drawing up a Regiment for Exercise or a Review, the Ranks are to be four ordinary Paces distance from one another, When they are to Fire, the Ranks are
<PB N="18" REF="003633_0019_100238A236E2CFD0"/>to be moved up to half distance which is two paces.</P>
<P>In all Wheelings, the Ranks are to be closed forward to close Order; which is to one pace distance.</P>
<P><HI>Distances of Files.</HI></P>
<P>When a Regiment is to be Reviewed or Exer∣cised, the distance between each File, is to be one pace, or the length of an out stretched Arm, When they are to Fire, they are to be at half a pace distance; in Marching or Wheeling, they must almost touch one another. The open∣ing of Files may be by the following words of command, To the left open your Files; at this both the Officers and Soldiers face nimbly to the Left on the right Heels, with this exception, that the File on the Right of the Battalion, and the eldest Captain are to stand still, the whole are to remain thus faced, Officers, Serjeants, Drummers and private Centinels, till the Word is given, <HI>March;</HI> upon which the Division of Drummers on the left, lift up their right Feet together, and march very slow, without opening their distance from one another, in a direct line to the Left.

<P>SUpposing there is four Platoons of Grana∣diers, and sixteen other Platoons, that con∣stitute the Battalion: the Square may be formed by three Words of Command.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Form the Square.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>March.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Face Square.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
At the first word of Command the two inward Platoons of Gra∣nadiers, and the six Platoons on the Right, the six Platoons on the Left, Face all to the Right about on their left Heels, the Officers in the Front &amp; Rear of those Platoons doing the same, as also the Serjeants who are posted in the Rear of those Platoons. The two outward Platoons of Granadiers with their Officers, as also the two division of Drummers on the Flanks, face to the Right and Left inwards. The four Platoons in the Center keep their proper Front. At the se∣cond word of Command, <HI>March.</HI> The Platoons which faced to the Right about, Wheel inward, and as soon as the Platoons which form the Right, Face, and those that compose the Left, Face, have Wheeled a Quarter of the Circle, they are to stand. Put the two Platoons on the Right of the Battalion and the two on the Left, being to compose the Rear Face, are to continue Wheel∣ing, inwards, another Quarter of the Circle, by which the Right and Left Platoons of the Batta∣lion join in the Center of the Rear Face.</P>
<P>The two Platoons of Granadiers which Faced to the Right about, Wheel at the same time with the Platoons of the Battalion, but instead of Wheeling on the extremity of the Flanks, they may incline inward, till the Granadiers in the Right come opposite to the interval between
<PB N="20" REF="003633_0021_100238A96662D3F8"/>the second and third, and the Granadiers on the left till they come opposite to the Interval be∣tween the fourteenth and fifteenth Platoon, and then to Wheel and March directly in the Rear of those Platoons, so that those Platoons of Granadiers will be on the Rear Angles, which they are to cover the two Platoons of Gra∣nadiers which faced to the Right &amp; Left inwards are at the same time to March in a direct line, to the Right &amp; Left Flanks of the four Center Pla∣toons, which stood, and when they come to the Flanks of those Platoons, they are to stand, be∣ing to form on the Front Angles.

<PB N="21" REF="003633_0022_100238ABC7340650"/>and rose who are posted in the Rear, remain with the Square in the Rear of the se∣vera Platoons, and when any of the Officers in the lont are Killed or Wounded, the Officers in the sear of those Platoons, are to move out im∣medtely, and take the Command.</P>
<P>Here are two very Material Advantages ari∣sin from this Method of Forming the Square,
<LIST>
