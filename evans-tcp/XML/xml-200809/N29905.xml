But to wave this Matter, my Honou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Countrymen, and of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er things of greater Importa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to your serious Consideration, is my present Inten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>And,</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="039759_0003_1015C130E5952B88"/><HI>First,</HI> To say something in the behalf of our poor condemned Bills. And the first Plea I shall offer is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his, that they may have a fair and legal Tryal, and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e condemn'd before they have had a hearing. What! to take them like the greatest of Pirates, and hang them up before the Sun, as the worst of Malefactors, when all their Days they have been labouring to serve their Makers and Masters, and brought some of them from nothing, to the Enjoyment of plentiful Estates! Would not this be sordid Ingratitude?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The second thing I would offer in be∣half of our Province Bills is this. They have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder God the Instrument of raising all those noble Buildings, in the room of which, a few Years ago, were Heaps of Rubbish, like so many Phenixes out of their own Ashes, which would never have been, had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t not been for these Bills. For <HI>these</HI> Men will work <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd toyl with utmost Pleasure; for <HI>these</HI> Men will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art with the best goods they possess▪ for <HI>these</HI> Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re ready (some of them) to run mad: The Possession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f them is doubtless a very great pleasure, or else they would never be so hoarded: The want of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doubtless a very great Affliction, or there would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever be such an <HI>Hue and Cry</HI> after them.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> These, by the Blessing of God, have paid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Expences thro' a long and Bloody War; without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich we should never have been able to subsist: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or <HI>these</HI> Men face the fiercest Enemies, defy the roar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g of Cannons and Armies of <HI>Philstians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> These will feed the Poor, and cloath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Naked; they will purchase good Beef in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epth of Winter for 4 <HI>d.</HI> or less <HI>per Pound,</HI> Butter for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>d.</HI> and many other things proportionable; and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is time they will purchase Rye for 3 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.</HI> Wheat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>s.</HI> Corn 3 <HI>s.</HI> Pork, 4 <HI>d.</HI> which, had we Silver Mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, could not be purchased for much less. Some cry, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e more Bills you make, the less will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Cre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and the dearer Provisions, and other things. But say Nay; for they have such a Currency, and so
<PB N="4" REF="039759_0004_1015C12CB3E02E90"/>
good Credit, and are built upon so sure a Foundation, that this Objection carries no manner of Weight in it. And as to the second thing, that Provisions will be dearer, is another false Insinuation; for we plainly and daily see, that when Provisions are scarce, they are also dear; but when Heaven blesses the Earth, and the Earth yields her increase in a plentiful manner, Provisions are immediately reduced; and we have from Year to Year been recovering from our heavy Loss by the late <HI>Canada</HI> Fleet: So vast a number of Mouths more than our own to feed, might well raise Provisions, and did so; and ever since that Fleet have been gone, they have been falling more or less. And I doubt not, but if the Eastern Settlements be secu∣red and protected from the Savage Monsters of the Wilderness, with the Industry of our own Country∣men, Commodities of all Sorts will be as cheap as ever. And I doubt not, but for Eight Shillings in Bills, you shall by as much Provisions, &amp;c. as for One Ounce of Silver Money in former times.</P>
<P>But then, some will say, upon what Footing shall we emit more Bills? We are very ready to do it, if we can find out any way that may not lead us into worse Difficulties than we now labour under for want of them. For answer, first, I would propose, that this General Court do emit Fifty Thousand Pound, more or less, as they think best for a Tryal, and let it out at 5 per Cent, as usual, to such, and such only, as shall give Land Security to double the value received, and oblige themselves to pay the Interest of the Sum taken up in Flax, Hemp, Wheat, Rye, Corn, Pork, Beef, Fish, Oyl, Camblets, Druggets, Serges, &amp;c. spun and wove in the Province; and that a Treasurer be ap∣pointed to receive the same as it comes in, and to sell it out as fast as possible for ready Money; and that the said Treasurer be obliged to lay before this Ho∣nourable House his Accompts yearly, and give his Oath to the same.</P>
<P>At the same time, that an Act pass for allowing a considerable Bounty upon Flax, and upon every Yard
<PB N="5" REF="039759_0005_1015C1340EEB9098"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge, Drugget, Camblet, and the like, and so upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cloth, spun and wove in this Province. I would propose, that some well skill'd Gentleman be ap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted, to see that what is brought into the Trea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be good and merchantable. And I would further <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose, that the Money these things fetch be laid out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly in setting up Spinning-Schools for poor Wo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; Children which will be as easy &amp; as pleasant an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loyment as to pick Ocum, &amp; much more adva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to the Publick. By this means people may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>plyed with Druggets, Camblets, and the like, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h cheaper than from other Parts. And this would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ently lessen our Importation: And when once we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to that, we may begin to project how Silver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come in: for it never can stay with us till our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>port is more than our Import.</P>
<P>And besides these Spinning Schools, I would pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se, that out of this Storehouse, all our Garrisons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> supplyed with Provision and Cloaths; and all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oney that must otherwise have come out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easury for this Use, be laid out in Fortifying our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stern Parts. Nay this Storehouse would soon be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, and people would flock thither for what ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmodity of those Sorts they shall have occasion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which would be of great service to particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sons as well as to the Publick. This would keep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Money circulating, and lay the Borrowers under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Impossibilities, for if 50 thousand Pounds be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n let out for ten Years at 5 per Cent, the Interest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounts to 25000 l. now how can 50 thousand pay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thousand; but paying the Interest in the produce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Country takes away this Impossibility, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves as much Money out as the Borrowers are oblig'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pay in.</P>
<P>Another Use the Interest of the Loan Money may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> put to is, to bring in Silver to us again, for sup∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the Publick with this Interest should build <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps and lade them with Fish, and send them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, Portugal, or other Places where it may fetch
<PB N="6" REF="039759_0006_1015C12F4DBBA7D0"/>
Silver and Gold, and have a Committe to manage tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Affair that it may not cumber them, and as fast as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> comes in to lodge it in the Treasury, till they have an equal Quantity to the outstanding Bills; and then by proclamation to call them all in, and give out Silver for them, making it death for any Man that shall carry or send above 20 s. at one time out of the Province hereafter.</P>
<P>But some will say, what if the Vessels and Cargo be lost, where are we then? I answer, just where we are before. The principal is yet good, the Country is no ways brought into debt by it, for if they make no Money, they can have no Interest for it, and if they do make it and lose the Interest, partly in stri∣ving so excellently to inrich their Country, in my humble Opinion, it is the very same thing though they lost it all.</P>
<P>Another vast Advantage might be made by the In∣terest of this Loan Money, would be to erect a Paper Mill; some thousands of Pounds is Imported in a Year in this one Commodity, which would be pre∣vented by the erecting a Mill our Selves, and the cost would be very small. Considerably less then a thou∣sand Pounds will set it to work, and by this means thousands of Pounds would be raised out of the Streets, and out of the Dust: For now the Rag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which would then be greedily and Industriously pickt up by the poor People, lay and rot.</P>
<P>Another vast advantage the Interest of this Loa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Money may be laid out to, would be in building a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hospital for poor Boys as in London and other pla¦ces, where instead of being brought up in Ignoranc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as too many are in this Country, they are well i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦structed in reading, writing, and the Mathematick as well as in the Languages; and by that time th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> arrive to 14 Years of Age, they are fit for any sort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Business, and many of them arrive to be famous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Generation. Early Instructions are of gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Use to Children, and well instructed Youths are li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>Thus having in some Measure laid before you the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xcellency of our Bills, the good they have done, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the great good they still may do.</P>
<P>I hope this honourable House will thoroughly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eigh the Matter, surmount all Difficulties which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emingly lay in the Way, and grant us a further Sup∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly of this Miracle working Paper Medium, that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s well as others may reap the Benefit of them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise to our selves noble Estates as they have done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore us: This will remove our present unhappy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rospects, and rejoyce the hearts of the People, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ause them with chearful hearts Honourably to sup∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort the Government, the Ministry, and Schools of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earning, and add to their now Wonderful Loyalty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> King George, and submission to his Government.</P>
