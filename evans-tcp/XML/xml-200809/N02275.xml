<HEAD>Historical Memoirs OF THE FIGHT at Piggwacket.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN <HI>Joshua</HI> with his chosen Sol∣diers, had Discomfited <HI>Amalek,</HI> with the Edge of the Sword<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (while <HI>Moses</HI> with the Rod of GOD in his up-lifted hands, supported by <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> made Intercession to the GOD of Armies, on the Top of the Hill) the <HI>Lord</HI> said to <HI>Moses, Write THIS for a Me∣morial in a Book, and rehearse it in the Ears of Joshua,</HI> Exod. XVII. 14. For this would be an un∣speakable Encouragement to that Renowned General, in his Wars with the Aborigines of <HI>Canaan.</HI></P>
<P>NOW from this Story we learn, not only, That if <HI>Israel</HI> would Prevail against their Enemies, they should all, but their <HI>Magistrates</HI> and <HI>Ministers</HI> especially, lift up and keep up, the hand of

Prayer:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Agreable to which, upon Intelligence of great Numbers of <HI>Indians</HI> coming down on the Frontiers, and the March <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f several of our Companies in search of '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m; at the motion of his Honour the Lieutenant Governour and the Ministers of <HI>Boston,</HI> the Publick Lecture there, on <HI>April</HI> 29. was turn'd into a Day of Prayer, which was but Nine Days before the Fight at <HI>Piggwacket:</HI> The Suc∣cess whereof should therefore be Ascribed with Thank∣fulness &amp; Praise to GOD as a Gracious Answer of the humble Prayers of his People, and improv'd as their far∣ther Encouragement.</NOTE> But also, That the Remarkable Preservation and Success of Soldiers in Fighting the Lord's Battles, are very proper to be Commemorated, for the Honour of GOD, &amp; Encouragement of his Ser∣vants, in future Expeditions, &amp; Military Actions.</P>
<P>IN Consideration hereof, I've the more easily comply'd with the Request of some of the Publishers of the Ensuing Sermon, that it might be accom∣pany'd with a Narrative of the Memorable Occasi∣on of it.</P>
<P>AND tho' I at first propos'd only to Reprint the Relation of this Action, given us in the Public News-Papers; yet having been favour'd with a more par∣ticular-account from the Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ous Capt. <HI>Wyman,</HI> and some others of good Credit, that were in the Engagement; I hope it will not be unacceptable to <HI>any,</HI> and am sure it will be very grateful to <HI>some,</HI> to have the Story Publish'd with some Enlargments: And particularly to make a Public Record of the Names of those Couragious Soldiers, who have so nobly play'd the man for their Country; several of whom have been grievously Wounded, and others have Died in the Field of Battle, or of the Wounds
<PB N="3" REF="002706_0005_0FE60F04122E2CC0"/>
they there Receiv'd: All of whose Names I am per∣swaded the greatest part of the Country will allow, deserve to be Transmitted unenvi'd to Posterity, with very bright Encomiums.</P>
<P>'TWAS then, about the 16<HI>th</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> 1725, that the Brave LOVEWELL began his March from <HI>Dunstable</HI> for <HI>Piggwacket,</HI> with <HI>Forty-Six</HI> Men un∣der his Command.</P>
<P>WHEN they'd Travell'd a little way, <HI>Toby,</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> falling Lame, was oblig'd to return, with great Reluctancy.</P>
<P>WHEN they came as far as <HI>Contoocook,</HI> one <HI>Wil∣liam Cummins</HI> of <HI>Dunstable</HI> was so disabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by a Wound h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d Receiv'd from the Enemy some time before, that the Capt. dismiss'd him, with a Kinsman of his to accompany him.</P>
<P>THEN they Travell'd as far as <HI>Ossapy,</HI> and there one <HI>Benjamin Kidder</HI> of <HI>Nutfield</HI> falling Sick; the Capt. made a Halt, and tarried while they built a small Fortification, for a place of Refuge to repair to, if there should be Occasion. Here he left his Doctor, a Sergeant and Seven other Men, to take care of <HI>kidder,</HI> and of a Considerable Quantity of Provision, here left to lighten the Men, and facili∣tate their March, and for a Recruit upon their Return.</P>
<P>WITH his Company now reduc'd to <HI>Thirty-Four</HI> Men with himself, the Capt. Travell'd to <HI>Piggwacket,</HI> which is about <HI>Forty</HI> Miles from said Fort.</P>
<P>THEIR Names that made up this Company (ex∣cepting his that started from them in the beginning of the Battle, and ran back to the Fort, which I'd be excus'd from mentioning) were as follow.</P>

FROM the <HI>Thursday</HI> before the Battle, the Com∣pany were apprehensive they were Discover'd and Dog'd by the Enemy: And on <HI>Friday</HI> Night, the Watch heard the <HI>Indians</HI> about the Camp and Alarm'd the Company, but it being very Dark, they could make no further Discovery.</P>
<P><HI>SATURDAY</HI> the Eighth of <HI>May,</HI> while they were at Prayers, very Early in the Morning, they heard a Gun; and sometime after spy'd an <HI>Indian</HI> on a Point, that ran into <HI>Saco Pond.</HI></P>
<P>THEY now concluded that the design of the Gun, &amp; of the <HI>Indian'</HI>s Discovering himself, was to draw them that way: And expecting without fail to be Attack'd; It was now proposed, whether it were Prudent to venture an Engagement with the Enemy, (who they perceiv'd were now sufficiently Alarmed,) or, endeavour a speedy Retreat. The Men Gene∣rally &amp; Boldly Answered, <Q>We came out to meet the Enemy; we have all along Pray'd <HI>GOD</HI> we might find 'em; and we had rather trust Providence with our Lives, yea Dy for our Country, than try to Return without seeing them, if we may, and be called Cowards for our Pains.</Q></P>
<P>THE <HI>Captain</HI> readily comply'd to lead them on, though not without Manifesting some Apprehensi∣ons;—And (supposing the Enemy were a Head of 'em, when as it prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, they were in the Rear) Ordered the Men to lay down their Packs, &amp; March with greatest Caution, and in utmost readiness.</P>
<P>WHEN they'd March'd about a Mile and Half, or two Miles, Ensign <HI>Wyman</HI> spy'd an <HI>Indian</HI> com∣ing toward them, whereupon he gave a Sign and they all squat, and let him come on: presently

several Guns were Fir'd at him; upon which the <HI>Indian</HI> Fir'd upon Captain <HI>Lovewell</HI> with <HI>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI>-Shot and Wounded him Mortally (as is supposed) tho' he made little Complaint, and was still able to Travel, and at the same time Wounded Mr. <HI>Samuel Whiting:</HI> Immediately <HI>Wyman</HI> Fir'd at the <HI>Indian</HI> &amp; Kill'd him; and Mr. <HI>Frie</HI> &amp; another Scalp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him.</P>
<P>THEY then March'd back toward their Packs, (which the Enemy in the mean while had seiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d) and about Ten a Clock, when they came pretty near where they'd laid 'em, on the North East end of <HI>Saco Pond,</HI> in a plain Place, where there were few Trees and scarce any Brush; The <HI>Indians</HI> rose up in Front and Rear, in two Parties, and ran toward the English Three or Four Deep, with their Guns Presented: And the English also Presented in a Moment, and ran <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o meet them; and when they came within a few Yards, they Fir'd on both sides, and the <HI>Indians</HI> fell amain, but the English (most, if not all) scap'd the first Shot, and drove the <HI>Indians</HI> several Rods, both sides Firing three or four Rounds. But the <HI>Indians</HI> being more than double in Number to our Men, and having soon Kill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Captain <HI>Lovewell,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fullam,</HI> (only Son of Major <HI>Fullam</HI> of <HI>Weston</HI>) Ensign <HI>Harwood, John Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Jonathan Kittridge, Daniel Woods, Ichabod Johnson, Thomas Woods</HI> and <HI>Josiah Davis;</HI> and wounded Lieutenant <HI>Farwell,</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Robbins</HI> and <HI>Robert Usher,</HI> in the place where the Fight began, and striving to Surround the rest; The Word was given, to Retreat to the Pond, which was done with a great deal of good Conduct, &amp; prov'd a vast service to the English (in Covering their Rear,) tho' the <HI>Indians</HI> go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Ground where our Dead lay.</P>

THE Fight continu'd very Furious &amp; Obstinate, till towards Night. The <HI>Indians</HI> Roaring and Yel∣ling and Howling like Wolves, Barking like Dogs, and making all Sorts of Hideous Noises: The Eng∣lish Frequently Shouting and Huzza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, as they did after the first Round. At one time, Captain <HI>Wyman</HI> is Confident, they were got to Powawing, by their striking on the Ground, and other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mo∣tions, but at length <HI>Wyman</HI> crept up towar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; Firing among 'em, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ot the Chief Powaw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> up their Meeting.</P>
<P>SOME of the <HI>Indians</HI> holding up Ropes, ask'd the English if they'd take Quarter, but were An∣swer'd Briskly, they'd have none but at the Muzzle of their Guns.</P>
<P>ABOUT the middle of the Afternoon, the Inge∣nious Mr. <HI>Jonathan Frie,</HI> only Son of Captain <HI>James Frie</HI> of <HI>Andover,</HI> a Young Gentleman of a Liberal Education, who took his Degree of Bachelor of Arts at College, 1723▪ and was Chap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to the Com∣pany, &amp; greatly Belov'd by them, for his Excellent Performances and good Behaviour, and who fought with Undaunted Courage till that time o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Day, was Mortally Wounded. But when he could Fight no longer, He Pray'd A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>bly seve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al times, for the Pre∣servation &amp; Success of the Residue of the Company.</P>
<P>'TWAS after Sun set when the Enemy drew off, and left our Men the Field: And it's suppos'd not above <HI>Twenty</HI> of the Enemy went off well. About Midnight the English got together, and found <HI>Ja∣cob Farrah,</HI> just expiring by the Pond, and Lieute∣nant <HI>Robbins</HI> &amp; <HI>Usher</HI> unable to travel.

Four of the Wounded Men, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Farwell, Frie, Davis</HI> and <HI>Jones</HI> after they'd Travell'd about a Mile and Half, found themselves unable to go any further, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h their free Consent, the rest, (hop∣ing for a Recruit at the Fort, and to come back with Fresh Hands to relieve them,) kept on their March. But one Morning as they were passing a thick Wood, they Divided into Three Companies for fear of making a Track, by which the Enemy might follow them. One of the Companies came upon Three <HI>Indians,</HI> who pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d 'em sometime; And <HI>Elias Barron</HI> one of that Party stray'd from the rest, and got over <HI>Ossapy River,</HI> by the side of which, his Gun Case was found, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d he has ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r been heard of since.</P>
<P>ELEVEN in another Party recover'd the Fort, and to their great surprize▪ found it Deserted. For in the beginning of the Battle, the man that I Promised not to Name, ran directly to the Fort,
<PB N="ix" REF="002706_0011_0FE60F45E1AC8390"/>
and gave the Men Posted there, such an account of what had happen'd, that they all made the best of their way Home. There came in also to the Fort, One <HI>Solomon Kies,</HI> who having fought till he'd re∣ceiv'd three Wounds, &amp; lost so much Blood he cou'd not stand, He crawl'd to Ensign <HI>Wyman</HI> in the heat of the Battle, and told him <HI>He was a Dead Man; But</HI> (says he) <HI>if it be possible, I'll get out of the way of the</HI> Indians, <HI>that they mayn't get my Scalp.</HI> This <HI>Kies</HI> Providentially found a Canoe in the Pond, and roll'd himself into it, and was driven by the Wind some Miles toward the Fort; when being Wonderfully Strengthen'd, he got to the Fort, as soon as the Eleven aforesaid: and they all came in to <HI>Dunstable, May</HI> 13<HI>th.</HI> at Night. <HI>O that Men would Praise the Lord for His Goodness, and for His Wonder∣ful Works toward the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 15th. came in at <HI>Dunstable</HI> four more of our Soldiers, whereof Ensign <HI>Wyman</HI> was one; who says <HI>They<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d no sort of Food from</HI> Saturday <HI>Morning till</HI> Wednesday <HI>following,</HI> &amp; <HI>yet scarce felt at all Hunger-bitten.</HI> They then caught two Mouse-Sqirrels, which they roasted whole, and found them a sweet Morsel. Afterward they Kill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d some Partridges &amp; other Game, and were Comfortably Supply'd, till they got home.</P>
<P><HI>Eleazar Davis</HI> came in at <HI>Berwick,</HI> &amp; reports, (as I'm Inform'd) that He &amp; the other Three left with him, when they'd waited some Days for the Return of the Men from the Fort, &amp; at length despair'd of their coming, tho' their Wounds S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ank &amp; were Cor∣rupt, &amp; they were ready to Dy with Famine; yet they all Travell'd several Miles together, till Mr. <HI>Frie</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="002706_0012_0FE60F5AB85AA2C0"/>
desired <HI>Davis</HI> &amp; <HI>Farwell</HI> not to hinder themselves any longer for his sake, for that he found himself Dying, and so lay down, telling them <HI>He should never rise more: C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng</HI> Davis, <HI>if it sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d Please GOD to bring him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome, to go to his Father,</HI> &amp; <HI>tell him, that he expected in a few Hours to be in Eternity; and that He was not afraid to Dy.</HI> Whereupon they left him; and this Hopeful Gentleman Mr. <HI>Frie,</HI> who had the Journal of the March in his Pocket, has not been heard of since.</P>
<P>Lieutenant <HI>Farwell,</HI> who has been very much, &amp; no doubt Deservedly Applauded, was also left by <HI>Davis</HI> a few Miles distance from the Fort and not heard of since. But <HI>Davis</HI> getting to the Fort and finding Provision there, tarried and Refresh'd himself and recover'd strength to Travel to the place mention'd. <HI>Josiah Jones</HI> another of the Four, came in at <HI>Saco.</HI></P>
<P><HI>SINCE</HI> the Action, Col. <HI>Tyng</HI> with a Company, have been on the spot, and there found and Buried Twelve of our Men. Whose Names are inserted to∣gether at the end of these Memoirs. They also found where the <HI>Indians</HI> had Buried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ree of their Men, and when they were dug up, One of them was known to be the <HI>Bold</HI> paugus, who has been such a Scourge to <HI>Dunstable;</HI> but if he be gone to his own place. He'll cease from Troubling.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Honour</HI> Our Excellent Lieutenant <HI>Governour</HI> has been Pleas'd to give Ensign <HI>Seth Wyman,</HI> a Captains Commission, since his Return, as a Reward of His Valour. And it's much to be Desired, that He, and all that are Return'd from <HI>Piggwacket,</HI> to their own Houses, will consider and shew what <HI>Great Things</HI> GOD has done for them. And that they &amp;
<PB N="xi" REF="002706_0013_0FE60F45ED37F168"/>
all our Brave Soldiers, will still take for their Motto, when going forth to War, the Inscription made by <HI>Moses</HI> on his Altar of Gratitude, after the Defeat of <HI>Amalek</HI> JEHOVAH-<HI>Nissi, The Lord is my Banner</HI></P>
<P>BUT thus I've related the Story of the Action at <HI>Piggwacket,</HI> in a Style adapted to our Common way of telling i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and according to the best Information I cou'd obtain; and hope there are no <HI>Material,</HI> I'm sure, there are no <HI>Willing</HI> or <HI>Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ss</HI> Mistakes in it.</P>
<P>AND I ve only to add,</P>
<P>THAT whoever Considers the Distance our Peo∣ple were at from any English Settlement, in a How∣ling Wilderness, &amp; very far in the Enemies Country, who were at Home, &amp; more than double the Number of our Men; Their Fighting from Morning till Night in a Long, Hot Day, without any Refreshment; The Number Kill'd and Wounded, amongst whom were some, that were Persons of Distinction on both sides; will doubtless grant that this Action Merits a Room in the History of our <HI>New-English</HI> Wars, whenever a Continuance of it shall be Publish'd. If any judge, I've observ'd some Circumstances in this Action too Minute, I've only to say, if some such Persons, or their Relations had been in the Action, it's possible they would not have been of this Opinion. However, those who I am firstly Oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to Gratify, wont easily come into their Sentiments in this matter. And I must beg of the others to forgive me this Wrong, &amp; that they'd only consider, the Different Taste of Readers, &amp; consequently the extreme Difficulty, if not Impossibility of pleasing every Body, in a Per∣formance of this Nature. And yet none would be
<PB N="xii" REF="002706_0014_0FE60EC7C1BE7CC8"/>
more willing to do it, than the Unworthy Author, who is a Hearty Lover of His Country, and of all Good Men of every Denomination.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Book before us is Entitled <HI>The Second of Samuel;</HI> not, that it was written by the Famous Prophet of that Name; (for it contains an History of what came to pass, after his Death; of which we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e an account in the beginnining of the XXV. Chap. of the former Book) but the latter part of the <HI>former,</HI> with the whole of <HI>this</HI> Book, is supposed to be written by <HI>Nathan</HI> or <HI>Gad,</HI> or by <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zekiah</HI> or <HI>Ezra.</HI> And probably it's call'd, <HI>The Second of Samuel,</HI> by the Hebrews, because It's a Continuation of the History began by him; and so, being <HI>a Sup∣plement</HI> to the History of <HI>Samuel,</HI> it goes under his Name; as is usual in such cases now a days.</P>
<P>IN the Chapter before us, we've a very Celebra∣ted Elegy; of which our Text is the Conclusion. And here we may observe.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="2" REF="002706_0016_0FE60F5AC7685108"/>
(1) WHO was the Author of this Elegy, or Funeral Poem; Namely, <HI>David:</HI> Agreably it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s termed in our Psalm-Book, <HI>David'</HI>s <HI>Elegy.</HI> The Sweet Psalmist of Israel was a Poet, as well as Musician; and has given us a noble Specimen of his admirable Poetick Genius, in the Mourn∣ful Poem before us. But we're to consider Him here, not only as a finish'd Poet, but as an Emi∣nent Servant of GOD, even the Man after GOD'S own heart: who d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly considering the works of the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and regarding the operations of His hands, has set us a very bright Example, how to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>have upon, and what Improvement to make of, the Death of Useful Men<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; especially of such, as not only have Jeoparded their Lives unto Death, but nobly laid down their Lives, in the high places of the Field, in the Service of their King &amp; Country: <HI>David</HI> Lamented with this Lamentation.—</P>
<P N="2">(2) OBSERVE the Subject and Occasion of this Elegy; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> The Death of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jonathan;</HI> who with many of their Army fell down slain upon Mount <HI>Gilboa,</HI> 1 Sam. 31. 1, 2, 3. Tidings of this Slaughter being bro't to <HI>David,</HI> he was greatly af∣fected therewith: and (as was customary amongst the Hebrews on such sorrowful occasions) <HI>David, took hold on his clothes and rent them, and likewise all the men that were with him. And they mourned and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt and fasted until Even, for</HI> Saul <HI>and for</HI> Jonathan <HI>his Son, and for the people of the Lord, and for the house of</HI> Israel; <HI>because they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en by the Sword.</HI> Context 11, 12. <HI>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</HI> And having done Justice on the young Amalekite that bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the News, who by his own Conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>on had stretched forth his

hand to slay the Lord's anointed; He further gave vent to his Grief, in the Elegant Composition be∣fore us.</P>
<P N="3">(3) OBSERVE the Matter and Substance of this Elegy: or, what <HI>David</HI> said on this great Oc∣casion. And <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st,</HI> He utters this mournful assertion, <HI>The Beauty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Israel is Slain upon thy high places!</HI> ver. 19. Expert Soldiers are no inconsiderable part of the beauty of <HI>Israel.</HI> Then follows a very pathe∣tical Exclamation, which is thrice repeated, <HI>v.</HI> 19. 25, 27. and is the burthen of the Song, <HI>How are the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>len!</HI> We have then his Poetical Wish, with the Reason of it, That the Tragical News might not be published, <HI>v.</HI> 20. <HI>Tell it not in</HI> Gath, <HI>publish it not in the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reets. of</HI> Askelon: <HI>lest the Daughters of the Philistines rej<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yce, lest the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>augh∣ters of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncircumcised triumph.</HI> The Imperative Mood is used in the beginning of the verse for the Optative, after the manner of pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ionate Mourners, who often wish for things impossible.

And they put his Armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his Body to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Both-shan.</HI> We have next <HI>David<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>s Imprecation, on

the place of the defeat, with the Reason of it. v. 21. <HI>Te Mountains of Gilboa, let there be no Dew, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> let there be Rain upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he shield of the Mighty is vilely cast away.</HI>—Some think this only a Figurative Speech, suppo∣sing the very Heavens and Earth had a kind of sense and feeling of this Calamity: Others think it a Prophetical Curse, that took effect accordingly, even as our Saviour's, denounc'd on the Barren Fig-Tree.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dr. Willet <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> &amp; Peter Martyr, <HI>quoted by him.</HI> Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i <HI>Crit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a.</HI></NOTE> But this is confuted by <HI>Brochard</HI> &amp; others, that have been upon the place. We may therefore look upon it, as only an Hyperbolical Poetical Im∣precation.</P>
<P>DAVID then goes on to commend <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jo∣nathan,</HI> for their wonderful Success at Arms, <HI>v</HI> 22. <HI>From the Blood of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of</HI> Jonathan <HI>turned not back, and the sword of</HI> Saul <HI>returned not empty.</HI> They were wont to be Victorious over their stoutest Enemies. And that it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s otherwise now, and that these Valiant Men are fallen, argues that GOD is angry; which should a∣waken his people to Repentance. He further ce∣lebrates (as, their affection to one another and Union in Death, <HI>v.</HI> 23; so,) their Agility and Courage. <HI>They were swifter than Eagles, they were bolder than Lions.</HI> They were <HI>Swift</HI> and Nimble to pursue their Enemies, and to avoid danger; and <HI>Strong</HI> and Valiant to resist and overcome such as dare oppose them. Briefly, he commends <HI>Saul</HI> for his Royal Bounty to the Daughters of <HI>Israel,</HI> whom he calls upon to Lament him, <HI>v</HI> 24. <HI>Ye Daughters
<PB N="5" REF="002706_0019_0FE60EA46E048098"/>
of</HI> Israel, <HI>weep over</HI> Saul▪ <HI>who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your Apparel.</HI> Even the Daughters of <HI>Israel</HI> had been wont to bear their part in <HI>Saul'</HI>s Triumphs, and now it became them to mourn his Fall. As <HI>all</HI> share in common Calamities; so <HI>all</HI> should be suitably affected therewith.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> DAVID particularly Laments over <HI>Jo∣nathan;</HI> professing his deep Distress for him, the dear affection between them, and the pleasure he took in his Conversation, <HI>v.</HI> 25, 26. <HI>O</HI> Jonathan, <HI>thou w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st slain in thy high places. I am distressed for thee, my brother</HI> Jonathan: <HI>very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of Women,</HI> who are commonly most affectionate.</P>
<P N="4">(4) OBSERVE some of the Properties of this Elegy. And, <HI>First,</HI> It is extremely <HI>fine</HI> and <HI>elegant,</HI> The Ideas are very bright, and well adapted: the Phrases are very Expressive and Emphatical, and hence the whole Poem is very moving and patheti∣cal. And particularly, where he speaks of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Friend <HI>Jonathan,</HI> nothing can be more soft and ten∣der, and express'd with a greater Pathos. And what more passionate, than his Repeated Exclama∣tion? <HI>How are the Mighty fallen!</HI> Those Valiant a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Renowned Commanders, <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> with their brave and undaunted Soldiers, that fell with them. So that <HI>the Weapons of War are perished i e,</HI> those that wielded them are dead. And what will Weapons do, without Men of Skill and Courage to handle them, for their Countrie's Preser∣vation and Defence, and the Suppression and Ex∣tirpation of their Enemies!</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002706_0020_0FE60F0C0AB62C18"/>
<HI>Again,</HI> THE whole Poem is sufficiently <HI>Brave</HI> and <HI>Manly.</HI> David shows himself a Man of a great Soul now, that <HI>Saul'</HI>s day was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome to die, &amp; GOD had delivered him out of his hands; and <HI>Saul</HI> could now no longer persecute and hunt him as a <HI>part∣ridge</HI> on the Mountains, as he'd a long while done; (for as in the <HI>Grave</HI> the weary Servants of GOD, are at rest, so, Blessed be GOD! when the Wicked are lodg'd <HI>there,</HI> they cease from troubling) I say tho' <HI>David</HI> was now delivered, he scorns to trample with insulting feet on the Monument of the Dead, and crow over a Breathless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rpse; But buries all the faults of <HI>Saul</HI> in perpetual oblivion, in the land of forgetfulness, lays aside all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pleen, and heartily mourns his Countrie's Reproach and Loss, tho' the very means of his own deliverance and advance∣ment, (a Noble instance of Public Spiritedness) and commemorates what was commendable, even in <HI>Saul.</HI> For, <HI>De mortuis, nil nis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bonum.</HI> None that are Men after GOD'S own heart, will unneces∣sarily rip up the faults of others; and speak evil of those that can't speak for themselves. Those that are not thus tender of the Reputation of others, may justly fear that others will be as free with them, when they are silent in the Grave.</P>
<P>BUT then, it's also a <HI>Martial</HI> Poem: 'tis written with a Martial Air. The Subject is intirely Mili∣tary. He Laments his Heroes, considered in their Military Character. He Celebrates their Military Accomplishments and Atchievments. And h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> De∣dicates it to the Militi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Judah</HI> as in the Paren∣thesis in the Preface, 18. <HI>v. also he bale them teach the Children of</HI> Judah <HI>the use of the Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> Whence
<PB N="7" REF="002706_0021_0FE60ED3C0E1FB90"/>
it's evident, That <HI>David</HI> in the midst of his mourn∣ing, is not unmindful of what was necessary for the good of the Common Wealth: Teaching us, not to be so overcome with Grief, on such sorrowful oc∣casions, as to forget our Duty and neglect means for our own or our Countries safety.</P>
<P><HI>Furthermore,</HI> THIS Elegy is very <HI>Ancient.</HI> 'Twas written about Eight and Twenty Hundred Years ago. And according to some Chronologies, before the Famous <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iads</HI> of <HI>Homer,</HI> who was the very Father of all the Heathen Poets, and said to be born in the Reign of <HI>Solomon</HI> the Son of <HI>David.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctor Historicus,</NOTE> It is then one of the first born of Elegies, and ven∣erable for it's Antiquity. It's said to be Recorded in the Book of <HI>Jasher,</HI> which is tho't to be a General Chronicle of the Acts of the Jewish Nation:<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Willet in loc▪</HI> &amp; <HI>al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI></NOTE> and call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Jasher,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Just</HI> or <HI>Upright.</HI> We read of it <HI>Josh.</HI> 10. 13. It's suppos'd this Book was continued from Age to Age, as a Collection of State Poems, (say some) or of the Memorable Acts of GOD's Worthies; and tho' laid up at length in the Temple (as <HI>Josephus</HI> reports) yet being not Ca∣nonical, is now lost.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> TO remark no more Characters of this Poem, It's a <HI>Scripture</HI> Elegy: for tho' we don't sup∣pose it at first written by inspiration; yet being a∣greeable to the Will of GOD, was adopted (if I may so express it) by the Holy Spirit, who inspired those that inserted it in the Sacred Pages, so that it is now a part of Canonical Scripture. And thus it's probable the Penman of the Chronicles Collect∣ed
<PB N="8" REF="002706_0022_0FE60EB660172620"/>
many things out of the Book of <HI>Jasher,</HI> being guided therein by the the unerring Spirit of GOD. And tho' the Name of GOD is not to be found in this Elegy, yet it is consonant to Religion, and ap∣proved by GOD; and we hence learn, that what is spoken or written by the Servants of GOD, may be very agreable to the Will of GOD and for his Glory, tho' the Name of GOD or CHRIST is not to be found therein. Thus the Book of <HI>Esther</HI> wherein are no less than Ten Chapters, has not the Name of GOD in it.</P>
<P N="5">(5) OBSERVE the main Scope and Design of this Elegy. And there are two things more especially that <HI>David</HI> had in view, after the Glory of GOD, his Ultimate End. <HI>First,</HI> To perpetuate the Me∣mory of <HI>Saul,</HI> and his Dearly Beloved <HI>Jonathan,</HI> his Bosom Friend. <Q>Great indeed was the Love between <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amon</HI> and <HI>Pythias;</HI> for when <HI>Dionysius</HI> the Tyrant, had on some occasion, signifi'd his Resolution, that one of them should Die; and per∣mitted <HI>Damon</HI> to go home and settle his Affairs be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore his Death, provided he could find one to be Surety for his return; <HI>Pythias</HI> forthwith offer∣ed voluntarily, and put himself in the Tyrants power. <HI>Damon</HI> coming back precisely at the time appointed, <HI>Dionysius</HI> did so much admire their mutual Fidelity, that he Pardon'd both, &amp; pray'd that he might be admitted the Third into their Friendship.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Colli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s Dictionary.</HI></NOTE></Q> But the Love of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Jona∣than</HI> was more Divine and Excellent, than that of these brave Heathen <HI>Philosophers.</HI> We've the ac∣count of it's Commencement, 1 Sam. 18. <HI>begin.
<PB N="9" REF="002706_0023_0FE60EBB5D44D028"/>
And it came to pass when he</HI> [David] <HI>had made an end of speaking to</HI> Saul, <HI>that the Soul of</HI> Jonathan <HI>was knit with the Soul of</HI> David, <HI>and</HI> Jonathan <HI>loved him, as his own Soul. And</HI> Saul <HI>took him that day, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t him go no more home to his Fathers house▪ Then</HI> Jonathan <HI>and</HI> David <HI>made a Covenant, because he loved him as his own Soul▪ And</HI> Jonathan <HI>stript himself of the Robe that was upon him, and gave it to</HI> David, <HI>and his garments even to his Sword and to his Bow, and to his Girdle.</HI> For such a Friend one would even dare to die. To be sure, <HI>David</HI> would have the Memory of this Just Man Blessed. He would have him had, in Everlasting Remem∣brance. And he here does his part, that it might be so, and the event was agreable to his pious desire, for wherever the BIBLE is enjoyed, this Elegy is still to be found on Record for a Memorial of him.</P>
<P>BUT then <HI>David</HI> had a further reach than bare∣ly to Embalm the Name of his Friend, and perpe∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate the Remembrance of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul,</HI> for his Relation to <HI>Jonathan</HI> and to his Country: For, by this Elegy, or F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neral Song, <HI>David</HI> design'd to fire the ambi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of his Contemporaries &amp; Successors, to seek to excel in Chivalry; and to fire them also with Zeal to pro∣secute the War against the Barbarous <HI>Philistines,</HI> and to avenge the Death of their Sovereign, and several of the Royal Family, and many other Gal∣lant Soldiers; and to defend themselves, against their Insults and Depredations. Agreably in the Parenthesis before mentioned, <HI>v.</HI> 18. <HI>He b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch the Children of</HI> Judah <HI>the use of the Bow.</HI>—The best Interpretation of which Passage (says <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nius</HI>) is, That it expresses the design of <HI>David,</HI> that
<PB N="10" REF="002706_0024_0FE60EDB064BEC58"/>
this Song, being put into the hands of <HI>Judah,</HI> it might serve to excite and provoke them to addict themselves to Martial Exercises, and to acquire Skill in the <HI>use of the Bow,</HI> which is here put for all Warlike Weapons then in fashion. And may the same use be made of the Discourse, you are now Reading, to provoke all among us, of a Military Character, to inure themselves to the use of the GUN, and all such Exercises as may accomplish them for Service in the Doleful War, we're unhap∣pily involved in.</P>
<P><HI>Having,</HI> Observ'd these things in General in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>legy, I come now to remark from the Conclusion of it.</P>
<P><HI>THAT the Fall of Brave and Successful War∣riours in the Field of Battle, is very much to be Lamented by the People of GOD, in whose immedi∣ate Service they Lost their Lives.</HI> We should La∣ment over them with this Lamentation, <HI>How are the Mighty fallen, and the Weapons of War perished!</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> IT is sometimes the Lot of the Bravest Warriours, and of such as have been very Success∣ful, to fall at last, or be slain in the Field of Battle. <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul</HI> had been a Brave Warriour, and did worthily in the beginning of his Reign. The History of his deli∣verance of <HI>Jabesh-Gilead</HI> when <HI>Nahash</HI> the <HI>Ammonite</HI> came up &amp; Encamped against it, is very noble and brave, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 11. <HI>begin.</HI> He discover'd both Great Cour∣age &amp; Conduct, in that whole action: At the 11<HI>th.</HI> we read, <HI>Saul put the people in three Companies, and they came into the midst of the Host in the morning watch, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w the Ammonites, until the heat of the day: and it came to pass that they which remained

<P>Secondly, <HI>THE Fall of Brave and Successful Soldiers is very much to be Lamented by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople of GOD, especially by those in whose immediate Service they Sacrific'd their Lives.</HI> For,</P>

<PB N="13" REF="002706_0027_0FE60EDB115D7AF8"/>
Soldiers are Slain in Battle, who have been im∣prov'd by Providence as Instruments of Checking the Pride and Insolence, and Weakning the Force, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hinning the Number, and Discouraging the Hearts of the Enemies of GOD's People, and of preserving the Lives, Liberties and Properties of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>srael of GOD; and might if GOD had spared them, be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a further Scourge to the Enemy, and Defence to the People of GOD, by contending with the Enemy in Battle: It's very proper and highly reasonable, such especially in whose immediate Ser∣vice they've Couragiously ventur'd and undaunt∣edly laid down their Lives, should Lament their Death And the Contrary, is, how indecent? how Sottish? how Stupid and Unreasonable? <HI>Now what∣so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver things are lovely, decorus, and of good report,</HI> Christians should love and practise these things, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4. 8.

It's Humane and Manly to do so: but the contrary is indeed, inhumane, and worse than Heathenish.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT is Just and Equal, for the Peo∣ple of GOD to Lament the Death of Brave and Suc∣cessful Soldiers Slain by their Enemies, and in their Service. Tears and proper Lamentations are a Debt we owe them. They've dearly merited this piece of Respect from their People. It's but just, to shed Tears for them, that have shed their Hearts Blood for us. And surely, if they deserv'd the Applause and Commendation of all while they Liv'd; they ought to be Honour'd with the Lamentations
<PB N="14" REF="002706_0028_0FE60F5BE5508550"/>
of all when they're Slain in the high places of the Field. And the Law of Equity calls for it. Surely 'tis to do as we would be done by; or as we should desire any of our Dear Relatives should be treated, in like circumstances. If it had been the Lot of any very nearly Related to us (and it has been so<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Capt.</HI> Av<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'<HI>s of</HI> Have<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hill; <HI>and Mr.</HI> Edward Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leton <HI>of</HI> Bradford <HI>with sundry others.</HI> Aug. 29 1708 <HI>and the Au∣thors Grandfather, and Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> Graves <HI>in the</HI> Dutch War.</NOTE>) to be Slain in Battle, or Sea-Fight, playing the Man for their People, and for the Cities of their GOD; surely a due notice taken of their Death, by the People of GOD, would be what we should expect and be pleased with. Now whatsoever we would that men should do to us, we should do the same to them; or, we transgress a Golden Rule. But if this Rule be out of fashion with any; yet</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> AGREABLE Lamentations for Expert and Successful Soldiers Slain in War, are very useful and advantagious. It's a Comfort to their Bereaved Relatives, when they observe that the People of GOD do greatly bewail the Death of their Friends, and heartily Sympathize with them, tho' their Loss may possibly be in some respects Irreparable; yet <HI>this</HI> should and will contribute not a little, to alleviate their sorrow, ease their distres∣sed minds, and dry up their Tears.</P>
<P>AND then, its a Spur to Virtue. When Survi∣ving Soldiers (and particularly such as have been Eye-Witnesses of the Fall of their Brethren, and fought with uncommon Bravery, and were either Wounded, or Equally Exposed in the same Battle,
<PB N="15" REF="002706_0029_0FE60EDC9B88DBD0"/>
with those that are Slain) take Notice that the Death of their Officers or Fellow-Soldiers is deeply resented by the People of GOD, that they still speak of them with great Honour in their Lamentations; this will Animate them, we hope, to do Worthily, and rather Die with Honour, if call'd to Battle, than live with Disgrace; and for their Cowardice, have the offer of a <HI>Wooden Sword,</HI> and be Branded with the Infamous Character of <HI>Cowards,</HI> even by the Weaker Sex.</P>
<P>WHEREAS, on the other hand, it's a great Ag∣gravation of the Affliction of distressed Mourners, when they observe that the Generality only give the News of their Friends Death, the hearing, but seem as Stoical and unconcern'd about it, as if their Lives were of no value, and their Death what does no way concern them. Such Ingratitude and Inhumanity is very Exercising to Ingenious minds and such as have any sense of Honour. Besides such a Sordid Insensibleness is very Discouraging to our Brave Soldiers. Who would be willing to venture their Lives for such ungrateful People!</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> IT<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>S Pious and Scriptural to bewail the Death of such Brave and Successful Soldiers, whose Lot it is to be Slain at last in the Field of Battle. GOD expects we should lay to heart the Death of all our fellow Creatures: <HI>That is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart,</HI> Eccl. 7. 2. And particularly, wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> oblidg'd to Lament the Death of Eminently useful Men, though they Die quietly in their Beds, and come to their Graves in a <HI>good Old Age, like as a shock of Corn comes in, in it's season.</HI> How much more should we mourn
<PB N="16" REF="002706_0030_0FE60F65DB37D1B8"/>
their loss, when Slain in Battle, in the midst of their Days, or in the very Flower of their Age, while their <HI>Breasts were f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of milk, and their Bones were moistned with marrow.</HI> It's a sore Judgment when GOD suffers such to fall <HI>by,</HI> and <HI>into</HI> the hand of the Enemy, and does not cover their heads in the day of Battle. This is an awful Frown, and argues the great displeasure of GOD. Hence He threatned the men of <HI>Anathoth,</HI> that said to the Prophet <HI>Jeremy,</HI> Prophesy not in the Name of the Lord, that their <HI>Young men should die by the Sword,</HI> Jer. 11. 21, 22. and a like threatning he denounc'd against <HI>Moab,</HI> Jer. 48 15.—<HI>His chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>th the King, whose Name is the LORD OF HOST.</HI> And when the Wrath of the LORD was risen against <HI>Israel,</HI> for their <HI>measure-filling Sin,</HI> in mocking the LORD's Messengers, despising his words and mis∣using his Prophets, it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s said, 2 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hron.</HI> 36. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. There fore he brought upon them, the King of the <HI>Chaldees, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lew their young men with the Sword.</HI> Now what greater cause of Mourning and Lamentation than the Manifestations of GOD's displeasure? If the <HI>Lion</HI> roar, who will not tremble? but alas, who can stand when GOD is angry! And he highly resents it, when his people are insensible under the Tokens of his holy Anger: if they cry not, when he corrects them. He says to such, <HI>why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more,</HI> Isa. 1. 5. and again, <HI>they are not humbled unto this day,</HI> Jer 44. 10.</P>
<P>BESIDES, We've many Scripture Precepts and Examples, that teach us to Lament, on the occasion
<PB N="17" REF="002706_0031_0FE60F0C15437F28"/>
under consideration. When GOD threatned <HI>Israel,</HI> by the weeping Prophet, that a People should come from the North Country, that should lay hold on Bow and Spear, being <HI>Cruel,</HI> and having <HI>no Mercy:</HI> Jer. 6. 22, 23. It's added, <HI>ver.</HI> 26. <HI>O Dau'ter of my People, gird thee with Sackcloth, and wallow thy self in ashes: make thee Mourning as for an</HI> ONLY SON, <HI>most bitter Lamentation;</HI>—Surely then, there should be a proportionable Lamentation, when several chosen Young Men, and some very promi∣sing and hopeful, are actually Slain by Men of the <HI>Chaldean</HI> Character. Another Instance we have, Jer. 9 17.—<HI>Consider ye, and call for the mourning Women.—Let them make haste—that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eye-lids gush out with wa∣ters—And teach your Dau'ters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation. For Death is come up,—to cut off the young Men from the streets. And even the Carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field—and none shall gather, or,</HI> BURY <HI>them. This</HI> evinces, that GOD calls to mourning when young Men fall by the Sword, and the Mighty in the Battle. And then to mention no other Scriptures, our Text and Context is a full and direct proof of our Do∣ctrine. For, as was observ'd before, this mourn∣ful Song was <HI>Davids</HI> Lamentation over those that were slain by the <HI>Philistines</HI> on Mount <HI>Gilboa.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I proceed to the APPLICATION. And,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> IF it's sometimes the Lot of the most Valiant and Successful Soldiers, to be slain at last in Battle; <HI>Then they that gird on the Harness should not boast as they that put it off.</HI> This was well observ'd by <HI>Ahab</HI> to <HI>Benhadad</HI> King of <HI>Syria,</HI> 1 Kings 20. 11. All such preposterous Boasting is evil; very fool∣ish
<PB N="18" REF="002706_0032_0FE60F65E5BCB0B8"/>
and ominous, and commonly followed with fa∣tal Consequences. Boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting <HI>Benhadad</HI> had cause and leisure in his inner Chamber to think of this wise Caution, when he had seen his Army miserably broken <HI>a first time,</HI> and slain with a great slaughter, by a Company of Striplings under the Command of <HI>Ahab</HI> their King: and <HI>a second time</HI> totally routed; an Hundred Thousand Footmen being slain in one Day by the <HI>Israelites;</HI> and Twenty Seven Thou∣sand more by the falling of a Wall upon them; and he reduced to such abject Circumstances, as to beg Quarter by his Ambassadors with Sackcloth on their Loins and Ropes on their Heads. How was the Scene now changed, and his Tune turn'd, 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 20. And thus we find the swaggering <HI>Goliah,</HI> who defy'd the Armies of the living GOD, one Minute cursing <HI>David</HI> by his gods, and disdainfully saying, <HI>Come to me and I will give thy Flesh to the Fowls of the Air, and to the Beasts of the Field;</HI> and the next Mi∣nute tumbling headlong with his Face upon the Earth: and the Beauty of <HI>Israel</HI> cutting off his Head with his own Sword. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 17. 1,—51.</P>
<P>GOD allows us indeed, in our Spiritual Warfare, (and in extraordinary cases, as, in <HI>David'</HI>s, answer∣ing the Challenge of the Giant, in a <HI>Carnal</HI> War∣fare also) to triumph before the Battle and to say, <HI>Thanks be unto GOD, that giveth us the Victory, thro' our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> For, in all these things we are more than Conquerors, thro' the Captain of our Salvation, whose is the Victory, and who hath lov∣ed us, and who will give it to us!</P>
<P>BUT without particular Revelation, not now to be expected, none can tell, whether the many, or the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew; the strong or the weak; the Righteous or
<PB N="19" REF="002706_0033_0FE60EF0A0E829F0"/>
the Wicked; the Friend or Enemy will get the Day in the Field of Battle. Boasting then, upon the going forth of Armies, is to be condemned; both in such as go forth to War, and in such as tarry at home, on their Account.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THE most Skilful, Dextrous, Coura∣gious and Successful Soldiers, <HI>had need be truly Re∣ligious and well prepared for Death;</HI> seeing they'r not Invulnerable, but as liable to Die as others. An <HI>Indian</HI> Bullet will kill a <HI>Hero,</HI> a <HI>Champion,</HI> as easily as a Faint-Hearted <HI>Coward:</HI> a <HI>Captain,</HI> or <HI>Chaplain,</HI> as soon as a Bringer up of the Front ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f-Files; or the most inferiour private Soldier. There must indeed be the Swiftness of the <HI>Eagle,</HI> the Sub∣tilty of the <HI>Fox,</HI> the Strength and Boldness of the <HI>Lion,</HI> as well as the Grace of the <HI>Christian,</HI> to con∣stitute a brave Soldier; and every devout Christian that's fit for Heaven, is not most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to go forth to War. But, tho' such as are destitute of Grace may possibly be stout Soldiers and noble Commanders, and deserve well of their Prince and Country; and in answer to the Prayers of GOD's People, in whose Cause they'r employ'd, they may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight valiantly, and play the Man for their People, and tread down the Enemy; yet if they'r slain, they cannot ground∣edly expect Salvation. Seeing then our Soldiers carry their Lives in their Hands, when they go forth to War, and are still liable to be Ambush'd, where'er they Travel in the vast howling Wilder∣ness, and, kill'd unexpectedly, as well as slain in a pitch'd Battle; they'd need be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ready not only to Fight, but to Die, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Appear∣ance before GOD. And in order thereto, they should <HI>now</HI> believe in CHRIST<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and repent of all
<PB N="20" REF="002706_0034_0FE60F122B391FE0"/>
their Sins, and so get into, and keep in good terms with GOD, who can easily preserve them, tho' a <HI>thousand fall at their side, and ten thousand at their right hand:</HI> and can cause one of them to <HI>chase a thou∣sand,</HI> and two to put <HI>ten thousand to flight.</HI></P>
<P>THE wretched <HI>Jesuites</HI> or <HI>Friers,</HI> are wont ('tis said) to absolve their deluded Proselytes, the bar∣barous <HI>Indians,</HI> when they come forth to War a∣gainst us: and flatter 'em with the promise of an immediate passage to Paradise, without any stop at Purgatory, if they fall in Battle: And these delu∣sive Hopes may possibly animate them, to fight with great Fury in their Engagements with us. And many private Soldiers and inferiour Officers in the Campaigns in <HI>Christendom,</HI> meerl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the pros∣pect of Applause, Promotion, or filthy Lucre; or for Thirst after Revenge, and a vain Opinion that Fighting in a good Cause, and on the right side, they shall surely be happy in the next World, if they'r kill'd in Battle, have possibly been led on to fight with undaunted Resolution, and the utmost Intrepidity. Surely then the Motives of pure Re∣ligion, such as serving GOD and their Country; having GOD to go before them, and fight for them, and ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her to cover their Heads, or, receive their departing Souls to the blessed Mansions above, where there is no Adversary nor evil Occurrent, where they shall <HI>rest from their labours, and their works shall follow them,</HI> must needs be sufficient, by the Influence of the Holy Spirit that dwelleth in all real Christians, to cause them to wax Valiant in Fight, and to raise them above the fear of what Earth or Hell can do unto them.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="002706_0035_0FE60ECBEF33E490"/>
SO then, <HI>A well grounded Perswasion of a Part in Christ, and an Interest in the Favour of GOD, is what all that go forth to War, would do wisely to give all Di∣ligence to obtain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> SINCE the best of Soldiers are liable to be overcome and slain in War, <HI>It ill becomes the Peo∣ple of GOD to put their trust in Man.</HI> Tho' it's their Duty and Wisdom to employ and encourage expert Soldiers; yet it's their Sin and Folly to trust in them. As it's Idolatry for <HI>Soldiers</HI> to trust in their Arms, or in their Dexterity and Courage to han∣dle them; or in one another: So it's Idolatry for the People of GOD, in whose Service they go forth to trust in <HI>them.</HI> For alas! What is Man whose Breath is in his Nostrils, and wherein is he to be accounted of? His Breath goeth forth, he return∣eth to his Dust; in that very Day, all his Proje∣ctions and Resolutions and Accomplishments for War, perish!</P>
<P>SURELY then, It's the greatest Folly for a Peo∣ple to trust in their Forces, how well soever quali∣fied, spirited and equipp'd: and how Successful so∣ever they have been. For, <HI>Every Creature is that to us that GOD makes it to be;</HI> and unless GOD give Help, <HI>vain</HI> is the Help of Man, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3. 23. <HI>Truly in vain is Salvation hoped for from the Hills, and from the multitude of Mountains; truly in the Lord our GOD is the Salvation of Israel.</HI> And we know who has said, <HI>Cursed be the Man that trusteth in Man, and maketh Flesh his Arm—But blessed is the Man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is.</HI> Jer. 17. 5,—7. Agreeably we find the People of GOD, resolving, in the Name of our GOD we will set up our Ban∣ners. And whilst <HI>some trust in Chariots and some in
<PB N="22" REF="002706_0036_0FE60EF0AC99FFD0"/>
Horses, we will remember the Name of the Lord our God,</HI> Psal. 20. 5—7. And again; <HI>Thro' thee we will push down our Enemies: Thro' thy Name we will tread them under that rise up against us,</HI> Psal. 40. 5. and Psal. 60. 12. <HI>Thro' God we shall do valiantly, for He it is that shall tread down our Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>MEN may fail us, be overcome, and utterly frustrate our Expectations: But, if we trust in GOD, we may pray with <HI>Asa,</HI> when <HI>Zerah</HI> the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> came against him, with an Host of a Thou∣sand Thousand, and three Hundred Chariots; LORD, (said he) <HI>It is nothing with thee to help, whi∣ther with many, or with them that have no Power: Help us O LORD our GOD, for we</HI> REST <HI>on thee, and in thy Name we go against this Multitude. O LORD, thou art our GOD, let not Man prevail against thee.</HI> The Lord of Hosts is Immortal, and Invin∣cible; He has all Creatures at His Command, and can cause the Stars in their Courses to fight against the Enemies of His People; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell <HI>Sisera</HI> into the hand of a Woman. In a Word, whatsoever the Lord pleaseth that he doth; It is therefore better to trust in him, than to put Confidence in Man, <HI>Psal.</HI> 118. 8.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> ARE the Bravest and most successful Soldiers, liable to fall in Battle? Such then as are preserv'd in Military Expeditions and Engagements, and safely return'd to their Families and Friends, are oblig'd to study <HI>what they shall render to the Lord,</HI> and take heed they don't forget <HI>his Benefits,</HI> but that all their Days they perform their Vows. It is the LORD that has covered their Heads in the Battle; It is the LORD that redeemed their Lives from Destruction, when those, no more expos'd than
<PB N="23" REF="002706_0037_0FE60F4817196FD8"/>
they, are fallen, and gone down to the Grave, and shall come up no more, and return to their Houses no more. O that all such as have experienc'd the distinguishing Favour of Heaven, would praise Him for his Goodness, and not content themselves to desire Thanks to be return'd for them in the pub∣lic Assemblies of GOD's People, tho' that is com∣mendable, but that they would endeavour to live the Praises of GOD. They should now at their Leisure, calmly and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>equently during Life consi∣der, what <HI>Great Things</HI> GOD has done for them. How He has greatly honour'd them, in inspiring them with so much Courage, and making them the Instruments of so much Service to their Country.—And also how GOD has highly favour'd them, in so wonderfully preserving them, in His distinguish∣ing Providence, so that all their Bones may say, Who is like unto Thee! The LORD who is a pre∣sent Help in Trouble, was ready to save them: They should therefore <HI>sing their Songs</HI> in the House of the LORD all the Days of their Lives! It's very displeasing to GOD, when His People don't render to Him according to his Benefits, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 32. 25. <HI>David</HI> celebrates the Praises of GOD, for Preservation and Success in War, <HI>Psal.</HI> 18. and <HI>Psal.</HI> 144. <HI>begin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> HENCE the People of GOD ought to ascribe to Him the Glory of all their Success in War. His is the Victory, and he gives it to whom∣soever he will. He furnishes Men with Military Skill and Courage: <HI>Teaches their Hands to War, and their Fingers to Fight.</HI> He finds out the Enemy for his People, and gives a Presence of Mind to their Forces; and if they are not swallowed up quick,
<PB N="24" REF="002706_0038_0FE60F66F332DB78"/>
when Men, vastly superiour in Number, and other Advantages, rise up against them, it's because the LORD is on their side, <HI>Psal.</HI> 124. Again, we find <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak</HI> giving Glory to GOD, for aveng∣ing his People in the defeat of <HI>Sisera</HI> and his Host, <HI>Judg.</HI> 5. and how often is <HI>David</HI> the famous War∣riour of <HI>Israel,</HI> harping on this String, as we noted before.</P>
<P>GOD highly resents it, when his People Sacrifice to their own Net, and burn Incense to their own Drag: When they ascribe that to Instruments that is due to GOD alone. This no doubt often pro∣vokes GOD, to deprive a People of their Chosen Soldiers. For he is a very jealous GOD, and will not give his Glory to another. And, as the former Pastor of this Church would say of Ministers, we may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay of Soldiers, <HI>People kill them two ways:</HI> either, by ascribing too much, or too little to them: Idolize∣ing of them, or Detracting from them, and Despi∣sing of them.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> LET us all <HI>Religiously Lament</HI> the Fall of the Brave <HI>LOVEWELL,</HI> and several of his <HI>Gal∣lant Company,</HI> that offered themselves willingly a∣mong the People. Let us take up this Lamentation over them, <HI>How are the Mighty fallen!</HI> And if we would herein approve our selves to GOD, let us consider that these Brave Men (tho' I hope we've many left as capable of serving their Country, yet they) were <HI>no inconsiderable part of the Beauty and Strength of New▪ England.</HI> Indeed, being wholly a Stranger to most of them, I can't pretend to give their Character; yet it's evident to the Country, they were Men form'd and rais'd up by Providence to serve us in pursuing an Enemy, of whom we
<PB N="25" REF="002706_0039_0FE60EE76E7DE2D0"/>
may say as of the wild Ass, <HI>The Wilderness yieldeth Food for them and for their Children,</HI> Job 24. 5.</P>
<P>THESE our <HI>worthy Friends</HI> could endure Hard∣ness as good Soldiers: And were well able to En∣counter the Fatigues of long Marches, both in Win∣ter and Summer. Some of them were well acquain∣ted with the Woods, and with the Customs and Lurking Places of the Enemy, and were mightily Spirited to pursue them, and GOD did graciously preserve and prosper th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> this last Winter in Two Expeditions, <HI>First,</HI> Delivering <HI>Two Indians</HI> into their Hands, and then <HI>Ten</HI> stout Fellows as you all remember, whom they kill▪d, without receiving any harm from them. <HI>This was the Lords doings, and marvellous in our Eyes:</HI> And in this last Engage∣ment, they were inspir'd with a great deal of Brave∣ry and good Conduct, and their Company crown'd with wonderful Success. Now to lose such expe∣rienc'd Soldiers, and Men so respected in the Coun∣try, is a great Loss.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> LET us consider, that this is the Finger of GOD. Let not any say prophanely and atheisti∣cally, <HI>It's the Fortune of War:</HI> or, as a good Man said on a bad Occasion, <HI>The Sword devoureth one as well as another,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> 11.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. For tho' it's true, <HI>The Battle is not to the Strong, and Time and Chance happens to all Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> yet the Hand of the Lord, is <HI>here∣in</HI> gone out against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and there are Tokens of his Displeasure to be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n in this Affair. That this brave Company should be so weakned by leaving so great a Number with one that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll ill, and that at so great a distance from them. That one of the Com∣pany should so unhappily leave them in the begin∣ning of the Fight, and bring such News to those le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="26" REF="002706_0040_0FE60F6704214428"/>
behind, that occasion'd their immediate Return; when their Continuance there, might have been such and unspeakable Advantage to those that sur∣viv'd the Battle. And indeed, it appears a Frown, that they should venture so far with so small a Num∣ber at that Season of the Year, when the Enemy are capable of better Subsisting in <HI>Bodies,</HI> than in the Winter Season. I say, the Hand of the LORD appears in all this, that so many brave Men should descend into Battle and perish.</P>
<P>BUT then, We'r to consider, <HI>Why the Lord's An∣ger against us is not turned away. but his hand is stretch∣ed out still.</HI> Have not <HI>our Sins</HI> as really slain our magnanimous Soldiers, as ever <HI>David</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lew <HI>Uriah</HI> the <HI>Hittite</HI> by the Sword of the Children of <HI>Am∣mon?</HI> And should we not <HI>hear the Rod, and him that hath appointed it:</HI> And consider in this Day of Ad∣versity, what <HI>we</HI> have done; and humble our selves, and pray and seek GOD's Face? Thus did <HI>David</HI> and his Men, as in the Context. And the Men of <HI>Jabesh-Gilead,</HI> 1 Sam. <HI>ult</HI></P>
<P>SHOULD we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot endeavour to find out and put away the <HI>accursed thing</HI> from the midst of us; and <HI>turn to him that smites us?</HI> Should we not be awak∣ned by such Providences to get our Peace made with GOD, and engage and secure his gracious Pre∣sence with us, under our present dark Views?</P>
<P>HOW many Calls have <HI>NEW-ENGLAND</HI> had, from the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> and by the <HI>Press</HI> also, from Year to Year, To remember whence we are fallen, and Repent and do our first Works! How many <HI>Election-Sermons</HI> have been publish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d amongst us, fill'd with solemn Warnings, most earnest Exhortations and ample Testimonies for GOD, and against the <HI>pro∣voking
<PB N="27" REF="002706_0041_0FE60F09C8CD5F48"/>
Evils</HI> of the Land! But alas, How many are still acting the part of the deaf <HI>Adder,</HI> or as the Prophet expresses it, <HI>They refuse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o hearken, they pull away the Shoulder, and stop the Ear that they should not hear</HI> Zech. 7. 11. How many hate to be reformed? Yea, hate to be told by those that have good right, full power, and lawful Authority to do it, <HI>where∣in</HI> we <HI>should be,</HI> and <HI>what's to be done</HI> that we <HI>may be,</HI> a reformed People. How sad is it, if all the Notice taken by the generality of People, of the solemn Messages sent to them from the Lord GOD of their Fathers, is only to give them the hearing, and either <HI>Humm</HI> or <HI>Hiss</HI> the Preacher and his Per∣formance, pretty much as they stand affected to <HI>him;</HI> and it may be, with some considerable Formality, give him Thanks for his Sermon, (and then he comes off mighty well!) However, if they carry the Mat∣ter so far as to print the Sermon, yet perhaps they don't put it in Practice! But now, don't they de∣ceive themselves, that hear and read GOD's Word, but do it not? Or, <HI>What meaneth that Saying,</HI> Jam. 1. 22.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, By the sore Judgment of War, and particularly by the Fall of our Brethren we are now weeping over, GOD is loudly calling upon us to amend our Ways and Doings. And GOD expects we should all in our places endeavour a Reformation, that we should do <HI>our</HI> Part in this Work: And if we do so, whatever be the Event, GOD will set a <HI>Mark</HI> upon us, <HI>and our Labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</HI> Let not any then be dis∣couraged, because some proper Essays and noble Efforts have miscarried and prov'd abortive. Ne∣cessity is laid upon us: <HI>NEW-ENGLAND</HI> must
<PB N="28" REF="002706_0042_0FE60F6D990BD1C8"/>
Reform, or without a Spirit of Prophecy, any one that observes the Signs of the Times, may I think, evidently foresee, that in one twenty Years more, the Glory of <HI>New-England</HI> as <HI>New-England,</HI> will be much more than hitherto, if not TOTALLY eclip∣sed. <HI>GOD in his Infinite Sovereign Mercy prevent it!</HI></P>
<P>BUT then, our Soldiers that are fit to go forth to War, and may probably be call'd forth, You my Brethren in an especial manner, are oblig'd to take the Alarm given you by the late Intelligence. Be prevail'd with (if you han't yet done so) to cast a∣way the Weapons of your Rebellion against Hea∣ven, (for there's no making Peace Sword in Hand) and <HI>come as with Ropes about your Necks, and lie in the Dust, if there may be hope;</HI> and <HI>there is hope in Israel concerning you.</HI> Now's your time to make ready for Death. You'l have other Work to do, when en∣gaged in Battle. And besides, every Battle of the Warriour is with confused Noise, and <HI>Garments ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d in Blood;</HI> hearing the hideous Yellings and Ejula∣tions of the Enemy, and the Groanings of deadly wounded Men, and seeing them lie all bath'd in their Gore, may awaken you to cry to GOD and make your Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>: But alas, that's no time for Consideration, and Confession, and deliberate Re∣solution to forsake Sin and return to GOD. This should be done Now! And then as you should be excited by this awakening Providence to yield your selves to the Lord; to make haste and not delay to believe in <HI>Christ,</HI> and secure an Interest in Him: So, you should be prevail'd with to see that you've good Arms, and kept in good Order, with good store of Ammunition, and inure your selves to Mi∣litary Exercises, especially to the Art of <HI>Shooting,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="002706_0043_0FE60F4821F0FED0"/>
and be always ready, that you may issue out at an Hours Warning, if Occasion be; and not live careless and secure, after the manner of the <HI>Zido∣nians.</HI></P>
<P>AND if you'r truly Religious, and thus equipp'd for, and train'd to War, and GOD call you forth, He can easily, and we hope will, preserve and pros∣per you. He can make you swifter than <HI>Eagles,</HI> stronger and more courageous than <HI>Lions,</HI> as <HI>David</HI> elegantly describes his Heroes, and you need not fear all the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America.</HI> For if you fall in Battle, your Death is Brave, you die in the Bed of Honour, and your Rest will be Glorious. It well becomes a <HI>Soldier</HI> to die fighting, a <HI>Minister</HI> preach∣ing, and an <HI>Emperour</HI> standing. But commonly such Soldiers may take <HI>Caesar'</HI>s Motto, <HI>Veni, Vidi, Vici,</HI> I came, I saw, I overcame.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> IF we'd Religiously Lament on this Oc∣casion, we must not be disheartned and cast down, because a crew of <HI>Salvages</HI> have kill'd a few brave Men. No verily! It's beneath a Man, much more a Christian, whose <HI>Heart is fixed trusting in the Lord,</HI> to be thus affected with such evil Tidings. Such News should not daunt and terrify a Soldier, but whet his Courage, and make his Blood boil in his Veins, and especially, it should rouse 'em on such Occasions, to Rally forthwith and come to March with utmost Expedition, to recover if possible, our dear Brethren that lie wounded, and without Re∣lief in a howling Wilderness. That they may'nt perish with Famine, or fall into the Hands of a bar∣barous Enemy, to be kill'd over again, and tortur'd with <HI>Indian</HI> Cruelty. And also to give Christian Burial to the Remains of our departed Heroes. How
<PB N="30" REF="002706_0044_0FE60F6DA43CD330"/>
brave was it in the Men of <HI>Jabesh-Gilead,</HI> what an Instance of Gratitude and true Valour that we find recorded to their immortal Honour and our Instru∣ction, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 31. 11,—<HI>And when the Inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to</HI> Saul: <HI>All the valiant Men arose, and went all Night, and took the Body of</HI> Saul, <HI>and the Bodies of his Sons from the Wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there. And they took their Bones and buried them under a Tree in Jabesh,</HI>—Methinks the read∣ing those Words without a Comment, would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill a Soldier with Zeal sufficient to carry him with a sufficient Number, as far as <HI>Piggwacket,</HI> only to co∣ver the Dust, the <HI>valuable Dust</HI> of our gallant Sol∣diers, that there kept the Field; lest <HI>the Dau'ters of the uncircumcised rejoyce.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> WE should amidst our Lamentations, be much in Prayer to GOD. If we would have <HI>Israel</HI> prevail, we must keep up as well as lift up the hand of Prayer. If our Soldiers would constitute a Thundring, they must be a Praying Legion. And we that tarry at home must get into the Mount and pray for 'em. A <HI>good Woman</HI> in her Closet, (tho' she's afraid to take a Gun in her Hand) may serve her Country to very good purpose, even in respect of the War; as really, as the Magistrate at the Council-Board; or the most daring and well advis'd Commander in the open Field in a thro' Engage∣ment. For <HI>Prayer and Faith always were, are, and will be the Churches best Weapons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Once more,</HI> WHILE we lament our own and Country's Loss, we should not forget to sympathize with the <HI>distressed Relatives:</HI> The <HI>Widow</HI> and the <HI>Orphan,</HI> and such as mourn for an <HI>only Son,</HI> or other
<PB N="31" REF="002706_0045_0FE60F4D472D1110"/>
near Relations. They are greatly to be pitied, and their Case remembred in our Devotions. We should pray for them, that GOD would give them Songs in the Night, and say unto them weep not! That he would comfort those that are cast down, would afford 'em those Divine Consolations that are not small, and refresh their Spirits, in the multitude of their perplexed Tho'ts within them. That he would give them Patience to submit to his holy Will, to bear his Indignation, to hold their Peace and be still, knowing that he is GOD, who gives none account of his matters.—And that he would be a GOD to the <HI>Widow,</HI> a Father to the poor Father∣less <HI>Children:</HI> And better than <HI>Ten Sons</HI> to discon∣solate Parents.</P>
<P><HI>Briefly,</HI> WHILE we lament our Case is so <HI>sad,</HI> let us be very thankful it is no <HI>worse,</HI> that it is so well. That we've such abundant cause to sing of <HI>Mercy</HI> as well as <HI>Judgment.</HI> For tho' we've lost some brave Men, (and have cause to mourn on that score) yet it's probable the Enemy have lost more than treble the Number, and amongst them some of their Chiefs, and particularly their bold <HI>Paugus,</HI> and a remarkable Check is given to their Insolence, and many Lives may be sav'd by this means. While therefore we cry out, <HI>How are the mighty fallen!</HI> Let us admire the Divine Goodness, that under all their <HI>Hazards, Hardships</HI> and <HI>Disadvantages,</HI> so many are returned. That our Friends can't say as <HI>Job'</HI>s Messengers, <HI>I only am escaped alone to tell thee:</HI> But that so many are well, and give us the joyful Account that our <HI>little Army</HI> behav'd <HI>bravely,</HI> fought <HI>manful∣ly,</HI> and very <HI>successfully;</HI> so that tho' our Loss is great, yet our Enemies have no cause to Triumph.
<PB N="32" REF="002706_0046_0FE60E9ED2557F28"/>
<HI>O let us magnify the Lord, and exalt his Name together,</HI> that the Enemy did not swallow them up quick, that in Wrath GOD has remembred Mercy, and has not dealt with us after our Sins.</P>
<P><HI>To have done,</HI> LET us yet encourage our selves in the LORD our GOD. Let us return to the Al∣mighty and he will build us up. He will soon subdue our Enemies, and give us Peace in our Borders. His Hand can find out our Enemies, and he that made 'em, can make his Sword to approach unto them. Is the brave <HI>Lovewell</HI> and other brave Men dead! Who made them what they were? who spirited and enabled 'em to do what they did? It was the Lord of Hosts, who lives still, who has the residue of the Spirit, and can easily raise up others, and will do so, if there be Occasion, and we answer his Ex∣pectation, and turn to him with all our Hearts.</P>
<P>WE may then sing the CXXI, and CXXV, and XLVI Psalms, and say, <HI>GOD is our Refuge and Strength, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very present help in Trouble. Therefore will we not fear, tho' the Earth be removed, and tho' the Mountains are carried into the midst of the Sea: Tho' the Waters thereof roar and be troubled, and the Moun∣tains shake with the swelling thereof. The Lord of Hosts is with us, the God of Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b is our Refuge.</HI> Selah.</P>
