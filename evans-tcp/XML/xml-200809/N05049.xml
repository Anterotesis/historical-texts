<P>THE Commissioners being all arrived, were informed by Capt. <HI>Lithgow,</HI> Commander of <HI>Richmond</HI> Fort, That a Number of the <HI>Norridgowock</HI> Tribe were attending in order to the Treaty, and desired to pay their Re∣spects to the Commissioners: Who appointed Ten o'Clock the next Morning for that Purpose. And Notice was given to <HI>Theodore Atkinson,</HI> and <HI>John Downing,</HI> Esqrs; commissioned by the Governour of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> desiring them to be present if they saw Cause.</P>

<P>EIght of the <HI>Norridgowock</HI> Tribe (<HI>Toxus</HI> the Chief being absent and indispos'd) appear'd at the Commissioners Lodgings, where the Salutations to and from the Commissioners of both Governments were pass'd in the usual Form. After which the Indians desir'd a Supply of Provisions, &amp;c. which were accordingly or∣dered them. They then were inform'd by the Commissioners, That as soon as the <HI>Penobscott</HI> Tribe should arrive, who were daily expected, they would proceed to the Treaty.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="day">
<HEAD><HI>October</HI> 3. 1749.</HEAD>
<P>THere being no News of the <HI>Penobscott</HI> Tribe, the Commissioners dispatch'd a Whale-Boat to St. <HI>George</HI>'s Fort, with Letters to Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI> the comman∣ding Officer there, desiring him to let them know the Reason of the Indians Delay; and what his Expectations concerning them were.—Fourteen Men, Women and Children, of the <HI>Pigwacket</HI> Indians, who had lived among the English, in the County of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> during the War, and were sent down to be present at the Treaty, arrived this Day.</P>

<P>THe <HI>Norridgowock</HI> Indians desiring to speak to the Commissioners, express'd some Uneasiness at the Delay of the Treaty, and desir'd to know whether they might not be treated with separately, and so dismiss'd: But at length agreed to wait some Time longer, for the Arrival of the <HI>Penobscotts.</HI></P>
<P>The Commissioners enquired of them, Whether there had been a general Meet∣ing of all the Tribes of Indians, in order to propose a Peace, as the Delegates in∣form'd his Excellency Governor <HI>Shirley</HI> at <HI>Boston.</HI> And they confirm'd the Ac∣count given by the Delegates of such a general Meeting in Grand Council.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="day">
<HEAD><HI>October</HI> 6<HI>th.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Whale-Boat sent to St. <HI>Georges</HI> returned about Noon, with Letters from Capt. <HI>Jabez Bradbury,</HI> dated the 5th, advising, That two Messengers from the Indians came in that Day to inform him they would certainly be there in two Days, to embark for <HI>Falmouth.</HI></P>

<P>CApt. <HI>Thomas Bradbury</HI> came down from <HI>Saco</HI> Fort, with an Indian called <HI>Aisai∣doo,</HI> who, with two Others, came into the Fort on the 6<HI>th</HI> Instant, with a Flag of Truce. The other two declin'd coming to <HI>Falmouth</HI> to the Treaty. <HI>Aisai∣doo</HI> inform'd the Commissioners, That he had been about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ty Days from <HI>Canada</HI>; That <HI>Pooran,</HI> Chief of the St. <HI>Francois,</HI> with three Others to represent that Tribe, came away before him, and he expected to have found them here. The Indians brought Letters directed to Capt. <HI>Dominicus Jordan</HI> from his Relations at <HI>Trois Ri∣vicres,</HI> dated the 13<HI>th</HI> and 15<HI>th</HI> of <HI>September.</HI> 1749. Capt. <HI>Lithgow</HI> was sent in a Whaleboat to St. <HI>Georges</HI> with Letters, informing Capt. <HI>Bradbury,</HI> That the <HI>Norridgo∣wocks</HI> grew impatient; and directing him immediately to send back the Sloop sent for the <HI>Penobscotts,</HI> unless he had a good Degree of Certainty, that a Number of the Chiefs would be ready to embark by Thursday: And to inform them, in case they should arrive afterwards, that the Commissioners apprehended it was not for the Honour of the Government to wait any longer, and that they would return to <HI>Boston,</HI> and make Report to his Honour the Lieutenant-Governour.</P>
<P>The Commissioners from the Governour of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> set out this Day for <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> having left an Instrument under their Hands, impowering and desiring the Commissioners of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> to comprehend the Province of <HI>New-Hamp∣shire</HI> in the Treaty: And <HI>Roland Cotton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to sign the Articles in their Name and Behalf.</P>

<SPEAKER>Commissioners.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are glad to see you safe arriv'd, and in Health. We have been waiting here above a Fortnight for you. <HI>Toxus,</HI> and a Number of the <HI>Norridgo∣wock</HI> Tribe, and the <HI>Pigwackets</HI> from <HI>Boston,</HI> have also been here about the same Space of Time. We have been so long kept from home, that we design to return as soon as possible. We propose to have a Conference with you all in the Afternoon, and have notified the other Tribes of it. And if any Thing previous is to be said, you may now speak with Freedom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet.</SPEAKER>
<P>What made the Hindrance was <HI>Loron</HI>'s writing a Letter to the Governour, discouraging our coming hither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you write you would come notwithstanding?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Em.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: <HI>Casimit</HI> wrote a good Letter, and we are come accordingly; and have now no more to say.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then the Commissioners drank King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Health to the Indians, which was pledged by all the Indians present.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you expect that the Captive <HI>William Mackfarland,</HI> shall be any longer with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, We have delivered him up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>He shall go Home with his Father, who is here present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are content.</P>
</SP>
<P>The <HI>Norridgowocks</HI> coming in, Mr. <HI>Hutchinson</HI> told them, That the <HI>Penobscotts</HI> were now arrived, and that the Treaty would begin at Three o'Clock: And if they had any Thing previous to Offer, they might also do it.</P>
<P>They were then told that they might all go on board the <HI>Massachusett</HI>'s Sloop and Dine, where Provision should be ordered them.</P>
<P>They, making no Reply, were told, That the Reason of directing them to go on board was, that they might, if they pleas'd, consuit together before the Conference in the Afternoon: Which they then replyed was agreable to them. The <HI>Norridgo∣wocks</HI> also drank King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Health with the Commissioners, and then withdrew.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Post Meridiem.</HEAD>
<P>THE Commissioners being seated in the Meeting-House, and the several Tribes of Indians being present; they were informed that an Oath would be now ad∣ministred to <HI>Roland Cotton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> truly to enter all Matters that should pass at this Conference: And to Capt. <HI>Joseph Bean</HI> truly to interpret what should be said both by the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> Which Oaths were administred accordingly.</P>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Hutchinson,</HI> in the Name of the Commissioners, spoke as follows, <HI>viz..</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometime in the Month of <HI>June</HI> last Nine of your Brethren came up to <HI>Boston,</HI> and they made proposals of Peace in the Name of all the Tribes to Governour <HI>Shirley,</HI> in a Conference had with him. They also pro∣pos'd a Meeting of their Tribes in this Part of the Province, to treat and agree
<PB N="6" REF="006336_0005_1028A33FF4D94C00"/>
upon the particular Articles or Terms of Peace; declaring they were not then fully authorized for that Purpose. The Governour promis'd to meet them by himself, or by his Commissioners at this Place the 27th of <HI>September</HI> last. Soon after this, His Excellency's Affairs obliged him to go to <HI>Great-Britain</HI>: And some Affairs of Con∣sequence requiring the Presence of the Lieutenant-Governour at <HI>Boston,</HI> He has appointed Commissioners with as full Power as He would have had if He had been personally present.</P>
<P>We have been waiting here fourteen Days: The two Gentlemen from the Go∣vernment of <HI>New-Hampshire</HI> waited here also some Time; but being obliged to return, they have impowered us to act in their Behalf; and have authorized <HI>Roland Cotton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> to Sign in their Name and in behalf of their Government, such Ar∣ticles as we shall agree to.</P>
<P>Sundry Gentlemen of both Governments have been likewise waiting here some Time upon this Occasion, but were obliged to return Home.</P>
<P>The <HI>Norridgowocks</HI> have also waited as long as we have; but we have defer'd treating with them till the <HI>Penobscots</HI> should arrive.</P>
<P>We have now taken the first Opportunity to confer with you all together.</P>
<P>We have brought the Conference from <HI>Boston</HI> of <HI>June</HI> last; and hope you have brought what was delivered you.</P>
<P>We are pleas'd you have brought the Captive agreable to your Engagement.</P>
<P>We desire to know what Tribes you appear for, and how far your Power extends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray hear what I am going to say.</P>
<P>I have thought of this Matter a great while, and am now come.</P>
<P>It has been foul Weather; I have stay'd till fair Weather.</P>
<P>Ever since Governour <HI>Dummer</HI> treated with us, all the Indians lik'd it well, and have reckon'd it well ever since.</P>
<P>But yet there has been a dark Cloud for a Time, and a great deal of Blood spilt: But now let us try to cover it over and forget it; and then when that is done, Love will encrease.</P>
<P>For my Part I am come here for Good. Time has been when your young Men terrified ours and ours have terrify'd yours: But now the Time will come when they may see one another without Fright.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>We understand that you are the Chief of the Tribes; and that you are the proper Person to speak for them; and what you engage they will perform.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am Chief, and they are all of my Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I went to <HI>Boston</HI> for Peace; and you now see me for the same End here.</P>
<P>There were three Indians retarded our coming here in Time, viz. <HI>Loron, Sabousit</HI> and <HI>Wombamando</HI>; who would break up any Thing that is doing for Good. Notwithstanding I am now come to propose what can be done in Peace; for God is willing that we should both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> live in Peace. But <HI>Loron</HI> says, when there is a <HI>French</HI> War we must break again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Tribe is numerous; and but Five here! Are you properly impowered to act for the whole Tribe? Are they acquainted with your coming?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="006336_0006_1028A35962EDE8E8"/>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, We are to act for them all. We don't come here for Nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>When the Delegates were at <HI>Boston,</HI> they gave as one Reason why they could not finally agree upon a Treaty, because their young Men were not present; and they chose this Place that the young Men might be here.</P>
<P>How can you now agree without them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was at <HI>Boston,</HI> and am now here to make Peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you any ways better impowered now to make Peace, than when you was at <HI>Boston?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet.</SPEAKER>
<P>The King has made Peace, now therefore we will; and who shall contradict it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>The King's Subjects are bound by that. But how are you impowered?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet.</SPEAKER>
<P>We can bind our People, if they are not drunk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you bind and oblige the young Men of your Tribe as strong as if they were here present?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, They are obliged; and will stand by what We do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>When the Delegates were at <HI>Boston,</HI> they propos'd Governour <HI>Dum∣mer</HI>'s Treaty to act upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and We now do so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that Treaty a Peace is to last as long as the Sun and Moon endur. Is it your Design and real Intention now to establish a Peace which shall last for∣ever, notwithstanding what <HI>Loron</HI> says, or the <HI>French</HI> shall hereafter do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>For our Parts We shall not break it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> have never encouraged the <HI>Indians</HI> to make War with the <HI>French</HI>; but when the <HI>Indians,</HI> or their Ancestors have desired a Peace with the <HI>English,</HI> it was always readily granted: The <HI>English</HI> have always taken Measures to preserve and not to hurt them; but the <HI>French</HI> have always stir'd them up to War to their Destruction.</P>
<P>If a War should happen between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> are you resolved to keep Peace with us? We don't know of any War, but only desire to know your Sen∣timents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you have said we will carry Home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you no Power without going Home?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You speak angrily.</P>
<P><HI>Commissi.</HI> No, We only speak loud, as the Interpreter is hard of Hearing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to taking part with the <HI>French,</HI> I cannot now answer: We must consult upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="006336_0007_1028A3418ECC77A8"/>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>When the Delegates were at <HI>Boston,</HI> they said they would consult their Tribes; and it is now expected they will Answer.</P>
<P>To-Morrow is the Lord's-Day, upon which we do no Business. Therefore we desire you will retire to the Island prepar'd for you, where proper Provision is or∣dered you. We shall meet you again in this Place on Monday Morning next: And shall bring with us Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> And before that Time We and You may both consider of what has been now said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet &amp; Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well.</P>

<P>They then drank King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Health, and the Gentlemen's present; and withdrew.</P>

<P>We are glad to see you well in Health this Morning: We hope you have wanted for nothing since you were here.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing at all: We have had every Thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was agreed that both Sides should consider of what was said on Saturday. We were surprized to hear of some Things then offered on your Part relating to the Continuance of the Peace; The <HI>English</HI> never made any such Peace as that. It would be dishonourable for this Government, and no Service to you; and we can entertain no Tho't of it. You have always spoke well of Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty; and the <HI>English</HI> have lik'd it well. There was a better Under∣standing after that Treaty than ever before, and it lasted long; and the <HI>Indians</HI> then said it should last as long as the Sun and Moon endure. We have taken great Care of that Treaty. We have it with us now.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here M. <HI>Hutchinson</HI> shew'd the Original Treaty in Vellum.</NOTE> And the Delegates at <HI>Boston</HI> then propos'd this should be the Plan; And if you are of the same Mind now, we are ready to go over the Articles of that Treaty, and to come into a Peace agreable to that. We desire now to hear what you have to say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>You Gentlemen Commissioners: We have agreed to follow the Path of Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty: We desire to turn all the Blood upon the Ground, under it; and that all may be forgotten.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you speak for your self or your Tribes?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>We don't speak for our selves only, but for all the Tribes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it the Mind of <HI>Eger Emmet</HI> and that Tribe to pursue the same Path?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Eger Emmet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; We are all of that Mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell something. I know the Minds of the <HI>Canada</HI> Indians; one of them, being present, is an Evidence.</P>

Upon the Cessation of Arms, the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> were sent for, and went up to <HI>Canada,</HI> and discharg'd all the Guns which were loaded in the War; and the Governour then told them, that if they should shoot at any of the <HI>English,</HI> they had as good shoot against their own Brothers: The Governor of <HI>Albany</HI> sent Belts of Wampum to the several Tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> between there and <HI>Canada,</HI> and then the Path of Peace was open.</P>

<P>Yes it was.</P>

<P>This Woman brought one of her Sons home, the other died and yet you say one is left, which cannot be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>We believe the Boy that was left was taken from <HI>Piseataqua.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is expected, agreable to this Article, that this Boy be returned home.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We would have had him come home last Spring, but he would not come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>We insist upon it, that if he is willing, or can be prevail'd upon to come, that you will return him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>We will deliver him up.</P>

<P>It is very well.</P>

<P>Inquiry was also made after a young Man taken at <HI>Colerain,</HI> but no certain Account given.</P>
<P>Inquiry was then made after two young Men, one taken at or near <HI>Albany,</HI> the other at <HI>Goreham</HI> Town; but no Account of them.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commiss.</SPEAKER>
<P>We expect you deliver up all the Indian Captives taken, as much as if they were our own English People.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are two Indian Captives at <HI>Arreseguntoocook,</HI> and one at <HI>Moorena</HI>; who, tho' they are linked in with the Indians, must be returned when the Peace is settled. One of them named <HI>Caleb,</HI> the other <HI>Wabquish,</HI> the other in the Mountains; all take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at <HI>Annapolis.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>Then Mr. <HI>Hutchinson</HI> informed the numerous Assembly present, that if any of them had any Friends of Relations in Captivity, they might repair to the Commissioners at their Lodgings, and all proper Care should be taken for recovering them from the Indians.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commiss. to the Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you know one <HI>Christo,</HI> an Indian about 24 Years of Age, that lived near <HI>Winnepesioket</HI> Pond, that was taken by the <HI>English</HI> some Time since.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, We know him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commiss.</SPEAKER>
<P>That young Man has learned to read and write, and has a Trade, and would not come down with the Commissioners: However, if you will return the young Man before-mentioned, the Governour of <HI>Piscataqua</HI> will oblige <HI>Christo</HI> to return to the Indians again.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sayweremet.</SPEAKER>
<P>We desire there may be a Truck-House at <HI>Saco</HI> likewise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Commiss.</HI> The Trade has been so small at <HI>Saco,</HI> that the Government suppos'd there would not be any Need of a Truck-House there, but that <HI>Richmond</HI> Truck-House, would accommodate any Indian that us'd to trade at <HI>Saco.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But if you don't think the two Truck-Houses will generally accommodate you, we will inform the Gover∣nour of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sayweremet.</SPEAKER>
<P>We always thought there would be a Truck-House at <HI>Saco,</HI> agreable to Governour <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commiss.</SPEAKER>
<P>How much further is it to <HI>Richmond</HI> than <HI>Saco,</HI> for the St. <HI>Francois</HI> Indians to carry their Beaver to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sayweremet.</SPEAKER>
<P>We don't know. But it is a great Way, and who can carry Beaver such a long Way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commiss.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have heard what you have said about a Truck-House at <HI>Saco,</HI> and will acquaint the Governour punctually with it when we return home.</P>
<P>We have but one Word more to say.</P>
<P>There was a Misunderstanding about the Trade in Governor <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Treaty: We will have every Thing plain and clear now.</P>
<P>We are directed by the Government to assure you, That you shall have Goods as cheap as you shall be able to purchase them at the same Time in like Quantities at <HI>Boston</HI> with ready Money. And that we will give you as much for your Peltry as it can be bought for at <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>We are now ready to hear you upon any of the Articles.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have nothing further to offer. We like all that has been said, only we hear that there is an Indian Boy at <HI>Richmond</HI>'s Island, which we desire may be restored.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Boy was given to Capt. <HI>Jordan</HI> before the War by his Father, who is since dead. However, we will enquire into the Circumstances, and give you an Account in the Afternoon.</P>

<SPEAKER><HI>Jo,</HI> a <HI>Pigwacket</HI> Indian.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Boy was taken at <HI>Saco</HI> at the same Time we were.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have provided a Dinner for you, and in the mean Time we will pre∣pare the Articles of Peace, and desire to know whether it will be agreable to you to meet in order to sign them in the Afternoon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>We don't know of any Thing more to do to prevent it.</P>

<P>The Commissioners then drank King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Health, which was pledged by the Indians.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the Commissioners met the Indians in the Meeting-House.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have now almost finish'd in Love and Unity. Time was in Governor <HI>Dummer</HI>'s Day &amp; Treaty, we made Peace in all Love &amp; Unity. Why can't we do it now? 
<PB N="12" REF="006336_0011_1028A345A69E90F0"/>
We hope it will be so now, and that we shall live in Peace and Unity again. I wish all our Friends and Neighbours had been here, but since they are not, we will still do well. What we have been saying and doing, all our Tribes will like well. There are three of our young People that we shall be thankful to return to their native Land, viz. <HI>Oone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z, Mareuso,</HI> and <HI>Mareagit,</HI> at <HI>Plymouth.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>We suppose these are <HI>Pigwacket</HI> Indians. We shall force none of that Tribe to remain among the English, but they shall all be returned home. There was in the Morning something said by one of the <HI>Pigwackets,</HI> as if they were forced away from Home. This is the first Time any such Thing has been publickly sugges∣ted. Capt. <HI>Cutter</HI> brought them up, and declared they desired to come and live with the English; and when the Government ask'd them if it was so, they declared that it was so. Soon after the Treaty was appointed, the Government told them they might attend it if they would, and you now see them here with your own Eyes, at Liberty to return. And the Children were not kept back by the Government, but it was their own Choice, and they shall be sent down immediately.</P>

<P>We shall now read the Articles of the Peace, and they are to be interpre∣ted to you. If you don't perfectly understand every Article, let us know it, and we will explain it.</P>
