</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE special Occasion that turn'd my Thoughts to this singular Text, must be obvious to every one, acquainted with the present Situation of Affairs in this Flock: And to such, it's presum'd, I need make no Apology for being on so peculiar a Subject to day.</P>
<P>The Consideration of this historical Passage might be introduc'd by some Remarks on the Context and
<PB N="2" REF="002871_0004_0FE67E8B16D34AD0"/>
Story it belongs to. But all I shall observe, is only this; That there being a Vacancy in the College of the Apostles, and several Candidates (called the one <HI>Joseph,</HI> or <HI>Barsabas</HI>; the other <HI>Matthias</HI>) being singled out by the Church and nominated for that important Post, they refer'd it to the Determination of Heaven, by the sacred method of a Lot, which of them should be the Man to fill up that superior Station. An Expositor on the place observes, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Henry.</NOTE> <Q>They were both such worthy Men, and so well qualify'd, that none cou'd tell which of them was fittest, but all agreed it must be one of them: Yet they did not propose themselves, nor <HI>strive</HI> for the place, but humbly sat still, and were appointed to it.</Q> The Church having chosen out and set up these as Candidates, they carry'd the matter to the Throne of Grace, spreading the Case before the Lord in Prayer, and then unanimously appealing to Him by a Lot for Determination. The Sum of the Prayer upon this great Occasion, we have on Record in the Text, — <HI>They prayed and said, Thou Lord who knowest the hearts of all Men, shew whether of those two thou hast chosen; that he may take part of this Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>I shall discourse to the Words, under these Ob∣servations.</P>
<P N="1">1. When some one is needed to fill up a Vacan∣cy in the Ministry, it shou'd be the Care &amp; Desire of all concerned, That the LORD JESUS CHRIST wou'd <HI>shew whom He hath chosen.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Application shou'd be made to Him by <HI>earnest Prayer</HI> in this important Case.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="3" REF="002871_0005_0FE67E8C6A0B3AB8"/>3. CHRIST is to be consider'd by us at all times and in all matters, but especially in the present Case, <HI>as the Lord, who knows the Hearts of all Men.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, I might observe, from the Interest the Eleven <HI>Apostles</HI> had in the Appointment of one to fill up their Number, &amp; the Pattern they have left of a just Concern and Forwardness before, and Satis∣faction after the Choice; That it is a very desirable thing to a faithful Minister to have an agreeable <HI>Colleague,</HI> to be <HI>a Partner</HI> and <HI>Fellow-helper</HI> with him in his Charge: And that he will be dispos'd glad∣ly to <HI>receive</HI> such an one as a Brother, whom <HI>the Lord sheweth he has chosen.</HI> — But I shall dismiss this last Remark with barely mentioning it, and only insist on the three former.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT. I.</HI> When some one is needed to be put into the Ministry, and fill up a Vacancy in this Ecclesi∣astical Order, it shou'd be the Care and Desire of all concern'd, <HI>That the LORD JESUS CHRIST wou'd shew whom HE hath chosen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THOU Lord, shew whether of these thou hast chosen.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Person</HI> immediately addressed to was most probably the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who is Lord of all, and Head of the Church; whose Prerogative it was to make Apostles, and who had before his Ascension personally chosen and appointed the Eleven.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ministry</HI> intended in our Text, was more especially the Apostleship; which is therefore added in the Text, — <HI>This Ministry and Apostleship.</HI> — It hints to us this just and useful Thought, (which in∣deed might have been mention'd first as a distinct Doctrine) That <HI>every Office in the Church of CHRIST is a Ministry</HI>; the Apostleship it self was so. Even CHRIST the Son of GOD, came to minister: And
<PB N="4" REF="002871_0006_0FE67E8C912F5A60"/>
shall the Servant be above his Lord? The Apostle says to Christians, We preach JESUS CHRIST the LORD, and <HI>our selves your Servants</HI> for JESUS sake. And if the Apostles, who were extraordinary Men of God, stiled their Work a Ministry; much more may the Pastoral Office be so called, which is in its Nature ordinary, and in dignity inferior to the Apostolate.</P>
<P>The Ministry is a common Name, which takes in all Offices in the Church, ordinary and extraordina∣ry, higher or lower. It is particularly very often apply'd to ordinary <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI>; and is grown by Custom very much their special Character and Denomination. They are set in the Church for the work of the Ministry: They are called to minis∣ter about holy things; are separated to the Ministry of the Word; appointed to minister the Gospel of Salvation. Their Office indeed, as it is a Ministry, relates more directly and properly to CHRIST, their only Lord and Master. However, in a Sense, they are Servants of the Church; as Magistrates are Ser∣vants of the Commonwealth, or as Angels are called ministring Spirits, sent forth to minister unto the Heirs of Salvation. Yet suffer me to observe, they are not so the Church's Servants, as to be oblig'd only to obey their Orders, and execute their Votes and Decrees. But are call'd <HI>Guides</HI> and <HI>Overseers</HI> of the Flock, and said to have <HI>the Rule</HI> over them. Not that they have Dominion <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your Faith, or Power to tyrannise over Conscience, by human Im∣positions, as Lords over God's Heritage; but are de∣sign'd to be Ensamples to the Flock, and Helpers of your Joy, by assisting your Walk in the Faith and Order of the Gospel: and shou'd desire only by ma∣nifestation of the Truth, and humble Exercises of the Power which CHRIST has given them for Edification,
<PB N="5" REF="002871_0007_0FE67E92E62F15E0"/>
and not for Destruction, to commend themselves to every Man's Conscience in the sight of GOD.</P>
<P>IT is only a <HI>Ministerial</HI> and Stewardly Power, that is vested in them; to be regulated in all its Operations, by the sacred Rules and Instructions given in the Word of CHRIST. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>N. B.</HI> The greatest part of what is premis'd here, was for brevity omitted in the Pulpit; tho' its thought fit to insert it in the Print.</NOTE> From hence they must learn how they ought to behave themselves in the house of GOD, and to govern their respective Charges; expecting no other Subjection and Obedience, from their People, than what it is the Will of CHRIST his Churches shou'd render to such as have the Over∣sight of them. Altho' they shou'd take Care not to betray the Authority of the Eldership; but be just to their Commission, true to their Master, and speak boldly in his name, according to his Word, teaching and warning every man, and as there is occasion, re∣buking some sharply: Yet they must take heed on the other hand, they don't make unjust Encroach∣ments on the Privileges of the Fraternity, but allow them their full Power of Consent and Liberty of Judgment, in Church-Administrations; in things proper taking their Concurrence, and ever using the utmost Care to give no offence in any thing, that the Ministry be not blamed. In particular they shou'd beware of an uncondescending Spirit, an unhappy Stiffness of Opinion, and resolute Opposition to the Brethren, in Cases of lesser Importance, where (what∣ever is pretended) Humour will seem to govern them, more than Conscience. It's true that by the Constitution of these Churches a considerable Power is lodg'd in the Elders, insomuch that it seems they can put a <HI>Negative</HI> (for weighty Reasons) upon any Vote of the Fraternity, whether concerning Admissions,
<PB N="6" REF="002871_0008_0FE67E93097EB9A0"/>
Dismissions, Censures, or the like. For so runs the last Paragraph in the tenth Chapter of our <HI>Platform</HI> of Church-Discipline; <Q>The ordinary Power of Government belonging only to the Elders, and the Power of Privilege remaining with the Bro∣therhood, — It followeth, that in an organick Church, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>By</HI> an organick Church, <HI>is meant (as our Synod in 62 have defin'd it, under Quest. II.)</HI> A particular Congregation of visible Saints in Gospel-Order, furnished with a Presbytery, at least with a teach∣ing Elder, and walking together in Truth and Peace.</NOTE> and right Administration, all Church-Acts proceed after the manner of a mixt Admi∣nistration, so as NO Church-Act CAN be con∣summated or perfected without the Consent of <HI>Both.</HI></Q> — By which it appears, that as according to our Principles, the Elders are not to exercise Church-Power, but by the Consent of the Brethren; So neither is there any Church-Act in ordinary cases valid without the Sanction of the Eldership: And indeed the <HI>Platform</HI> says, in so many words, <Q>That what the Churches are to act and do in these mat∣ters, they <HI>are</HI> to do in a way of Obedience — to the Direction — of the Elders. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.17. <HI>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and submit your selves</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Further, the eighth Paragraph is express, <Q>Nor may they oppose and contradict the Judgment or Sentence of the Elders, without sufficient and weighty Cause; because such Practices are mani∣festly contrary unto Order and Government, and Inlets of Disturbances, and tend to Confusion.</Q> And, as our famous Mr. <HI>Cotton</HI> (one of the Fathers of <HI>New-England,</HI> and first Teacher of this Church) has expounded our Platform in his celebrated Book of the <HI>Keys</HI>; the Power and Influence of the Pres∣bytery, both in the Church and in Synods or Coun∣cils, seems to me carry'd up to a greater Height con∣siderably,
<PB N="7" REF="002871_0009_0FE67E9611D041C8"/>
than is either usually practised by Elders, or in fact allowed by the Brethren. However, it behoves them, as Ministers of the meek and lowly JESUS, as much as possible, to deny themselves; to deny their own Opinions, and Wills, and Rights, and stoop to the Infirmities of Men, and submit to Things difficult enough to be borne, in many cases; upon the excellent Principles and Views that acted the first Ministers of CHRIST, (2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 3.9.) <HI>Not because we have not Power, but to make our selves an Ensample unto you to follow us.</HI> — So 1 Cor. 9.12. <HI>We have not used this Power, but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the Gospel of Christ.</HI> And 2 Cor. 6. <HI>In all things approving our selves as the Ministers of GOD, in much Patience, in Afflictions, in Necessities, in Tumults, under Honour and Dishonour, evil Report and good Report</HI> &amp;c. — They are not indeed to be the Servants of <HI>Men,</HI> so as tamely and servilely to prostitute their Authority to popular Humours, or Traditions of Fathers: Yet they must let their Moderation be known to all Men, while they faith∣fully execute the Commission they have receiv'd from CHRIST; and labour to be Examples of Meekness, Prudence and Condescention; becoming all things to all Men; pleasing them for their Good to Edifi∣cation; not seeking their own Profit, but the Profit of Many, that they may be saved; watching for Souls, as those that must give an Account, and con∣sider they are Stewards of the Mysteries of GOD.</P>
<P>But I proceed to observe as a further Preliminary. This Ministerial Trust is peculiar to a <HI>distinct Order</HI> of Men, instituted by CHRIST and of standing Use and Obligation.</P>
<P>The Ministry was originally <HI>appointed</HI> by CHRIST; and design'd, not for the Apostolick Age only, but to continue in the Church throughout all Ages; as
<PB N="8" REF="002871_0010_0FE67E9633ABD050"/>
might be argu'd, in that the Reasons of the Institution are of a moral nature, and perpetual continuance; and also from those Scriptures, which tell us, That CHRIST has set Pastors and Teachers in his Church for the Work of the Ministry, till we all come to a perfect Man; — That in the Lord's-Supper (the Administration of which is their peculiar Province) CHRIST's Death must shewed forth until He come a∣gain; — And that He has left a Promise to <HI>be with</HI> his Ministers (teaching and baptising in his name) to the End of the World &amp;c.</P>
<P>And it is an Office peculiar to a <HI>distinct Order</HI> of Men. 'Tis a sacred Inclosure, &amp; do's not lie in Com∣mon, for every one that pleases, to invade and oc∣cupy. All publick and special Offices in the State are limited to particular Subjects: So is the Ministry of the Gospel. This Honour no Man taketh to him∣self, but he that is called of GOD. A liberty of pro∣phesying, as held by some, appears to me but an unlawful Licence, and tends to unhappy Consequen∣ces. The LORD is a GOD of Order, and not the Author of Confusion, but of Peace: and wou'd have all things done decently and in order, in all the Churches of the Saints. 'Tis said indeed, <HI>Covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with Tongues:</HI> If a Man be inspir'd with miraculous Gifts, let him speak. But otherwise let him be orderly call'd and separated to the Work. In ordinary Cases, a regular Election and solemn Investiture into the Office are requir'd to the Exercise of it: So that without these Praerequi∣sites, even the preaching of the Word in a public and stated manner (without design or desire of engaging in the Ministry, when call'd to Office) and much more the Administration of Sacraments, must be look'd upon as no small Irregularities. Not that the Power (strictly speaking) comes by Election, or Or∣dination
<PB N="9" REF="002871_0011_0FE67EA016BA86F8"/>
of Men, but by a Charter or Commission from CHRIST open'd in the Gospel: Yet those human Actions are generally necessary to the <HI>orderly exercise</HI> of Ministerial Authority. A Power, and the Right to <HI>exercise</HI> that Power, are two things very distin∣guishable: The former usually deriv'd by Commissi∣on from some superior Authority; but the latter by a solemn Investiture, done in many cases by Equals or Inferiors. 'Tis the Charter of a City or Laws of a Coun∣try, that appoints all Offices, and their several Pow∣ers and Businesses: Yet that alone do's not intitle any individual Person to this or that Office, one more than another. But there is something further requir'd to put any into Place, and authorise their assuming and exercising public Trusts. Thus, in some cases, there must be a particular Commission from the Government, and in others Election by the People: And in all cases there's usually a solemn Oath admi∣nister'd to the Party chosen or appointed, which is a necessary introductive to the authentic performance of his Office. A Counsellour elect, tho' approv'd by the Chair, sits not at the Board, till he has accepted the Place, and taken the Oath of Fidelity. A Justice, or other civil Officer, can't use his Power, till he's sworn in solemn Form. The Commission or Election indi∣gitates the Persons to whom the Law or Charter gives this or that Power: But it's his taking the Oath appointed, that properly invests him in his Office, or introduces him into the public Exercise of it.</P>
<P>Even so, in the present case, The Power of a Gos∣pel-Minister originates and is founded intirely in the <HI>Institution</HI> of such an Order of Persons, which our Lord was pleas'd to make, and has reveal'd in the Gospel: Where He states their Duty, limits their Authority, and fixes their proper Character; which it is not left to the uncertain Humours of Men to vary
<PB N="10" REF="002871_0012_0FE67EA0357618A0"/>
from, add to, or diminish. So that to institute new Offices in the Church, or alter Offices divinely insti∣tuted, by increasing or lessening their proper Powers, Qualifications, and Employments, is nothing short of a bold Usurpation of CHRIST's Prerogative, and a rude Reflection upon his governing Wisdom, Good∣ness and Fidelity.</P>
<P>Yet the Institution requires some things preparato∣ry to the <HI>Exercise</HI> of the Office: And in ordinary cases (whatever may be allow'd for cases of Neces∣sity, which seem to carry a sufficient Warrant in themselves) it must be held contrary to Gospel-Or∣der, for any to exercise the Pastoral Power (or any branch of the Ministerial Office, except as Candidates or Probationers, occasionally) until solemnly invested with that Authority, and separated to that Work: Which is partly done by Election of the Church, and Laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery, and part∣ly by a voluntary devout Self-consecration.</P>
<P>Now (to come to the Business before us) when the Appointment and Investiture of some one into the ministerial Office is propos'd by a People, it shou'd be the Care and Desire of all concern'd, That the LORD JESUS CHRIST would <HI>shew whom HE hath chosen.</HI></P>
<P>In speaking to this point, several Things may be briefly attempted. As (1.) to consider <HI>who</HI> is intend∣ed by the Person whom CHRIST has <HI>chosen.</HI> (2.) To inquire <HI>how</HI> or in what <HI>ways</HI> He doth <HI>shew</HI> whom he has chosen. (3.) To give the <HI>Reasons</HI> why it shou'd be the <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Desire</HI> of a People, that CHRIST would shew whom He hath chosen.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>I am to consider</HI> Who <HI>is meant by the Person whom CHIRST has</HI> chosen.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002871_0013_0FE67EA15DAEA200"/>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. It means in general one whom He <HI>approves</HI> as sutably qualify'd for the Ministry, and in particular the Person whom He judges <HI>fittest</HI> for this place and people, and will <HI>own</HI> and <HI>bless.</HI></P>
<P>When we read of the <HI>Fast,</HI> which GOD hath <HI>cho∣sen,</HI> it means such an one as He desires, approves of, and takes pleasure in. When we read of the <HI>chosen</HI> Men of Israel, it means the <HI>Choicest</HI> of their Tribes, the mightiest and best Men they had. So a <HI>chosen</HI> Generation, means an excellent Generation, the Lord's peculiar Treasure, a Generation of his Praise. — <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> his <HI>Chosen,</HI> is <HI>Moses</HI> his Beloved, in whom is an excellent Spirit, and in whom is his Delight. When we read <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.14. Many are called, <HI>but few are chosen</HI>; it may be expounded by <HI>ver.</HI> 8. <HI>They which were bidden, were not worthy.</HI> So 1 Pet. 2.6. <HI>Behold, I lay in Zion a chief Corner-stone, Elect, Precious</HI>:—(ver. 5.) Disallowed indeed of Men, but <HI>Chosen of GOD,</HI> and <HI>precious.</HI> — A Man <HI>approved</HI> of GOD among you, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.22. — The Apostle means the same thing by those different phrases, <HI>Rom.</HI> 16.10 &amp; 13. Apelles <HI>ap∣proved</HI> in CHRIST; — Rufus <HI>chosen</HI> in the Lord.</P>
<P>So in our Text, by him whom CHRIST has <HI>chosen,</HI> we are to understand One that he approves of, as qualify'd for the Ministry, and has in special fitted for this Place and Station, and will accept, own, and bless therein. 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2.4. We were <HI>allowed of GOD,</HI> to be put in trust with the Gospel. <HI>Acts</HI> 9.15. He is a <HI>chosen Vessel unto me, to bear my name</HI> before the Gen∣tiles, and Kings, and the Children of Israel. <HI>John</HI> 13.18. <HI>I speak not of you all; I know whom I have chosen.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) It means the particular Person whom the Lord has <HI>decreed</HI> and <HI>appointed</HI> to this Post and Ser∣vice.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002871_0014_0FE67EA184716BB0"/>There are many Persons sutably accomplish'd for the Ministry, that Christ never designs to employ in this Work: And among the Candidates for a particular Station in the Ministry, there may be a Number suf∣ficiently fitted, and almost equally agreeable to a Peo∣ple; yet One only is design'd for it by our Lord, and his Counsel shall stand.</P>
<P>Shew whether of these <HI>Thou hast chosen,</HI> means in part, Shew which Thou hast appointed and sepa∣rated, in thy secret Counsels, unto this Ministry.</P>
<P>The Word of the LORD assures us, that Men are predestinated according to the Purpose of Him, who worketh all things after the counsel of his own Will. And as He hath chosen us before the foundation of the World, unto the Adoption of Children, accord∣ing to the good pleasure of his Will: So He has pre∣destinated some of us unto special Offices in his Church, and in particular unto the Ministry of his Gospel, to the praise of the glory of his Grace. Hence that of the Apostle, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.15. <HI>Who separated me, from my Mo∣ther's Womb.</HI> — Which may be explain'd by that to the Prophet, <HI>Jer.</HI> 1.5. <HI>Before</HI> I formed thee in the Belly, I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the Womb, <HI>I sanctified thee</HI> (or separated thee to an holy use) <HI>and I ordained thee a Prophet unto the Nations.</HI></P>
<P>It is from the beginning predetermined <HI>Who</HI> shall serve the Lord CHRIST in the work of the Gospel, and <HI>where</HI> he will employ them, in this or that part of his Vineyard. <HI>He hath determined the Times before appointed, and the bounds of their Habitation.</HI> If the Gospel of the Circumcision be committed unto <HI>Peter,</HI> and the Gospel of the Uncircumcision unto <HI>Paul,</HI> it's the Lord's doing; and herein <HI>he doth but perform the thing that was appointed for them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002871_0015_0FE67EAA224E8438"/>I pass now in the next place,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>To consider</HI> How <HI>or by what Means the Lord Je∣sus Christ doth</HI> shew <HI>whom He has chosen.</HI></P>
<P>And here it may be observed; He shews this sometimes in extraordinary ways, and sometimes by more ordinary means.</P>
<P N="1">I. He has sometimes shewn it in an <HI>extraordinary</HI> manner, by an <HI>immediate</HI> Call.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Aaron</HI> was made a Priest by the express Designation of GOD himself. <HI>Samuel</HI> and the Pro∣phets in old time, were call'd in uncommon ways, by heavenly Visions and Inspirations. — So the Apostles under the Gospel-Dispensation. Our LORD in the days of his flesh, personally nominated his first Minis∣ters, and orally shew'd whom he had chosen. See <HI>Mark</HI> 3.13, 14. — Again, When he rose from the Dead, he renew'd his Commission to the Apostles, and after his Ascension confirm'd their Call in an extra∣ordinary manner, when they <HI>receiv'd Power from on high,</HI> as we read <HI>Acts</HI> 3. — So He appear'd to <HI>Saul</HI> in a miraculous Vision, to make him a Minister, and call'd him by a Voice from the excellent glory; as in <HI>Acts</HI> 26.13 —</P>
<P>And besides the Apostles, many in the Apostolic Age, receiv'd immediate Calls to the Ministry; among whom were inspired Prophets and Evangelists. And perhaps oftentimes the Humane Call and the Divine Call, both met in one. It shou'd seem, <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were Instances of this. See <HI>Acts</HI> 13.2. and 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.14.</P>
<P>But we are not now-a-days to look for extraordina∣ry Calls: besure not such as are <HI>neither of Men, nor by Men.</HI> If any pretend to an immediate Mission from Heaven, let them confirm their Pretences, by evident Miracles and Prophecies; or we can't think they come with sufficient Credentials.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="14" REF="002871_0016_0FE67EAA469A98F8"/>2. The LORD usually shews whom He hath chosen in more <HI>ordinary</HI> ways, by a <HI>mediate</HI> Call.</P>
<P>He shews it by the voice of his Providence and Spirit, in more common methods of discovery.</P>
<P>Under the old Testament, Men were instated in the Priesthood by <HI>a Law of carnal Generation.</HI> GOD appointed the Posterity of <HI>Aaron</HI> to this Office, and the Succession went by natural Birth.</P>
<P>But now under the Gospel we have nothing to do with a Lineal Succession. This Method is abolish'd, and the Church of GOD left at their Liberty to de∣termine the Persons that shall be in Office among them. They are not confin'd to one particular Tribe or Family; but may <HI>chuse out of all the People.</HI></P>
<P>Here I shall say distinctly, (1.) The Matter is usu∣ally to be referr'd to a voluntary Election by <HI>Vote,</HI> or Human Agreement. Yet (2.) in some cases, it may be determin'd by the special medium of a Divine <HI>Lot.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Matter is usually refer'd to voluntary <HI>Elec∣tion,</HI> and Determination by VOTE: And when so, there must be such a Concurrence of Circumstances, as to render the Call plain and clear, if we would know <HI>whom CHRIST has chosen.</HI></P>
<P>I might premise here, It is a principle professed among us, that the Churches of CHRIST have in the present case a power of Election; the Liberty to vote for their own Officers. In defence of which it's urg'd that the very Apostles wou'd not appoint so much <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Deacons, to serve Tables, without the express Suffrage of the People. (See <HI>Acts</HI> 6. <HI>begin.)</HI> And it's argu'd, from <HI>Acts</HI> 14.23. Where we are told, <HI>They ordained them Elders in every Church</HI>; That the Disciples were allow'd the same Liberty and Privilege in the Choice of their Pastors: The original word for <HI>ordained,</HI> sig∣nifying in its first political use, to design or constitute any Person an Officer by common Consent, which was usually express'd by lifting up the hand. <Q>The
<PB N="15" REF="002871_0017_0FE67EAE1BF5C2B8"/>
word is but once more used in the New Testa∣ment, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.19. where it plainly signifies Elec∣tion to an Employment.</Q> — Speaking of some very worthy and famous Minister, the Apostle says, <HI>Who was</HI> chosen <HI>of the Churches to travel with us.</HI> But not to dwell upon this Argument; it is undis∣puted, that even in the Choice of an <HI>Apostle,</HI> to fill up the Twelve, the Disciples (being in number about 120 met together in one Body) were allow'd to come so near as to <HI>appoint</HI> the Candidates; any <HI>two</HI> from among themselves, whom they judg'd meetest for the place; and then they (together with the Apostles present) having first pray'd, <HI>gave forth their Lots</HI> for the particular Person. And the Lot falling on <HI>Matthias,</HI> he was <HI>numbred</HI> with the Eleven Apos∣tles, i. e. according to the Etymology of the greek word, was reckon'd among them by common Suf∣frage, receiv'd as an Apostle with universal Appro∣bation. — These things laid together are, I think, Authority sufficient, for the practice of the Churches, in chusing their own Officers: Which Ecclesiastical Li∣berty has been defended by some of our Divines, also from acknowledg'd Principles of natural Reason and common Equity, from the undoubted Rights and Customs of all free Societies, from the Nature of in∣stituted Churches, and the Ends of Order and Office-Power, as well as from primitive Practice<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>I. Mather</HI>'s, Order of the Gospel, <HI>page</HI> 69. And Dr. <HI>Owen</HI>'s True Nature of a Gospel-Church, <HI>page</HI> 62, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>. But We have no Leisure at present to recite what is said on these several heads.</P>
<P>All I have further to do here, is to limit and qua∣lify the method in common use among us: And wou'd say, In order to a discovery of the Mind of CHRIST, or knowing whom the LORD has chosen, a People must see to it that their <HI>Election he regulat∣ed
<PB N="16" REF="002871_0018_0FE67EAE4879C4F0"/>
according to his revealed Will, and the Call plain and clear, fair and orderly.</HI></P>
<P>Now to this End,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Some things are requir'd on the part of the <HI>Electing</HI> Body or Fraternity.</P>
<P>For Instance, This must be rightly <HI>constituted</HI>; con∣sisting of Persons duly qualify'd to act in the affair. They that chuse must be rightful <HI>Members</HI> of the Church of CHRIST. This is made necessary, by <HI>our</HI> Scheme of Church-Order, to qualify Persons to vote in chusing a Minister: And for it, we have the Countenance of Scripture, particularly in the famous Example before us. They that <HI>appointed the Two,</HI> as Candidates for the Choice in our Text, were all <HI>Dis∣ciples</HI>: By which Name the Body of Believers in that day were commonly call'd, in distinction from the Twelve. The <HI>Two</HI> were chosen, as the <HI>Seven</HI> are said to be, by <HI>the multitude of the Disciples.</HI> And we are told how many were present at the Choice of <HI>Matthias:— The number of the Names were about an hundred and twenty:</HI> who are describ'd as <HI>Men which had associated with the Apostles, all the time that the Lord</HI> JESUS <HI>went in and out among them.</HI> They were open and known Disciples of CHRIST, who had confessed Him before the World, and communicated in the special Ordinances of his Kingdom. They are represented afterwards (together with others ad∣ded to them) as <HI>continuing in the Apostles Doctrine and Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread</HI>—. It seems they were all in full Communion, and approv'd Chris∣tians: Not any Persons among them, of a scandalous Character, or an incomplete Profession.</P>
<P>Now, from this leading Example, it's thought, we may learn who are proper Subjects of the Liberty and Power of Election in the Cafe before us; Name∣ly, the avow'd Members of a Gospel-Church, stated∣ly associating therewith in all public Worship and
<PB N="17" REF="002871_0019_0FE67EB8228C0268"/>
Ordinances. — And indeed it's judg'd scarce ratio∣nal, that any shou'd be admitted to vote in a Com∣munity, or confederate Body, of which they are not orderly and confessed Members. Hence if there be any such distinct Society as a congregational Church, instituted in Scripture, it's thought a Principle found∣ed in Reason and the Nature of things, That none but approv'd Members of this particular Body, have a just Right to vote in their Ecclesiastical Affairs, especially in a case of such peculiar Con∣cern and Importance to the Peace, Purity, and Wel∣fare of the Church, as that of chusing a Pastor to watch over their Souls, and break the Bread of Life to them. It's pleaded by our Divines, that if we ex∣tend the Privilege beyond those Limits, we shall not easily know where to stop: Whether in respect of the Persons who must be admitted to this Privilege, or of other Privileges that such Persons may as reasonably lay Claim to. And it is observed, That some of the main Arguments for stretching this Liberty further (and in particular, that of contributing to the Mi∣nister's Maintenance) will if pursu'd in their ge∣nuine Consequences, carry the thing to a Length, that few, even of them who dislike the Limi∣tation among us, will care to have it brought to. Now it's a known Maxim, That Argument that proves too much, proves e'en nothing to the purpose.</P>
<P>To proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Another</HI> thing is, The Church must see to it, that there be a due <HI>Examination</HI> and <HI>Trial</HI> had of the Candidates for Office among them. It is expresly requir'd in the case of a Deacon, that the Person be <HI>first proved</HI> (try'd and approbated) <HI>then let him use the Office.</HI> (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.10.) Now surely it's of great∣er Consequence, that Elders and Teachers pass under a proper Trial: &amp; this not only with regard to their gene∣ral Qualifications for the Ministry, but especially as
<PB N="18" REF="002871_0020_0FE67EB845B326F8"/>
to their Fitness and Accommodation unto this Church and Place in particular. It seems reasonable that Christians shou'd judge for themselves, in this case. And who ordinarily are like to pass a better Judgment than the Church concern'd? They that were able in the Apostles day to <HI>look out</HI> among themselves, for the Deacons Office, Men of <HI>honest Re∣port, full of the holy Ghost, and of Wisdom,</HI> seem to me sufficiently capable of judging upon the Meetness of Persons for the Pastoral Care also. And are they not in many Places of Scripture expresly directed and ex∣horted to <HI>try the Spirits,</HI> whether they are of GOD; to <HI>beware of false Prophets,</HI> that come to them in Sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves, whom they shou'd know by their fruits; and if any Man preach <HI>any other Gospel</HI> unto them, than they have re∣ceiv'd, to hold him <HI>accursed.</HI> If there come any unto you, and bring not <HI>this Doctrine</HI> (saith the Apostle) receive him not into your house, neither bid him <HI>GOD speed.</HI> It's observable, the <HI>Bereans</HI> are com∣mended for trying of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI>'s Doctrine by the Scriptures. And the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> is com∣mended for <HI>trying them which said they were Apostles.</HI> These Scriptures (together with the Reason of the thing) appear to me a sufficient foundation for the common Custom among us of a popular Trial of Candidates. And if besides the usual Probation by public Preaching (which is more subject to Mistakes) there were also private inquiries, especially by per∣sonal Conference, it might be of great Use and Be∣nefit: Though this kind of Exploration seems to be∣long more particularly to the Presbytery of the Church, if there be any such before instated. Agree∣ably the <HI>New-England</HI> Platform assigns it to the El∣ders, as their special Province, saying <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Chap. <HI>X.</HI> Sect. <HI>9.</HI></NOTE> <Q>It belongs
<PB N="19" REF="002871_0021_0FE67EB98FD8AFB8"/>
unto the <HI>Elders</HI> to examine any <HI>Officers,</HI> before they be receiv'd of the Church.</Q> — Which seems highly reasonable, particularly for that by our Con∣stitution, the Elders of the Church are to transact the Business of Ordination, and officially or <HI>authori∣tatively</HI> install Persons into the Offices they are cho∣sen to. It's one Resolve, or Rule stated, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Platf. <HI>Chap.</HI> IX. <HI>Sect.</HI> 3.</NOTE> <Q>In such Churches where there are Elders, Imposition of Hands in Ordination is to be perform'd by <HI>those</HI> Elders.</Q> — Hence <HI>They</HI> are eminently concern'd in that Apostolic Charge, 1 Tim. 5.22. <HI>Lay hands suddenly on no man.</HI> — <Q>It is meet therefore <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chap.</HI> VIII. <HI>Sect.</HI> 3.</NOTE> be∣fore any be ordained or chosen Officers, they should first be tried and proved:</Q> And that the Eldership already subsisting in the Church, should not have any Colleague obtruded or impos'd upon them at least, while they have any rational grounds of Dissatisfaction. For as the Prophet speaks, <HI>Can two walk together, except they be agreed?</HI> — It is observable, the Vote and Lot in the Designati∣on of <HI>Matthias</HI> were manag'd in the Presence and under the Conduct of the Apostles. And so was the Election of the Deacons: as you may see in the Sto∣ry. From whence some infer, that there is a Power of Inspection and Guidance in the Choice of Officers (as well as in the Admission of Members) which be∣longs to the Elders; if there be any praeexisting in the Church. But whether this be a standing Right of the Eldership, or whether they have no more than the Liberty of common Suffrage, I list not to dispute. And upon another head, Our venerable Fathers have left us their concurrent Opinion, saying, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sect. <HI>8.</HI></NOTE> <Q>We judge it much conducing to the Well-being and Communion of the Churches, that where it may conveniently be done, <HI>Neighbor</HI>-Churches be ad∣vised
<PB N="20" REF="002871_0022_0FE67EB9B0DF5658"/>
withal, and their Help made use of in the Trial of Church-Officers, in order to their Choice.</Q> Upon which <HI>One</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See the late Rev. Mr. <HI>Symmer's</HI> Life, page 63.</NOTE> has well observed to this Purpose; "The Communion of Churches and Interest of Re∣ligion depend very much (humanely speaking) on the Unity and good Agreement of the Elders in the Vicinity. If they love one another, and agree well together, they will strengthen one ano∣ther in their Work: But if they disagree, this will tend to weaken their Hands, and discourage their Hearts more than a little. "Churches therefore ought, what in them lies, to suit their Neighbor∣ing Ministers and Churches, in the Choice of a Minister: Remembring they are not only to chuse an Officer for themselves, but a Neighbour for Them.</P>
<P>And certainly then it is adviseable that the <HI>Congre∣gation</HI> (as we distinguish) or Body of Noncommu∣nicants (being baptis'd Professors, associating con∣stantly in the Word and Prayer, with the Church concern'd) shou'd have some Regard shewn to them in this Affair; surely at least, as much as is due to any Christian Neighbours. And a great deal of Pru∣dence is generally necessary here, to consult their Peace and Satisfaction, while the Church's Right of Election (or Precedence in the Choice) is asserted and exercised.</P>
<P>But however these things be, surely a <HI>Trial</HI> ought to be made, by one means or other, sufficient for the Church more immediately concern'd, to form a ma∣ture Judgment upon; that there may be no place for <HI>Jude</HI>'s Complaint, <HI>There are certain Men</HI> (false Teach∣ers) <HI>crept in unawares.</HI> It behoves them to <HI>take Counsel together,</HI> for imparting Light to one another, in a way free from all Party-Designs and Artifices;
<PB N="21" REF="002871_0023_0FE67EC0EADBF838"/>
to proceed with a just Deliberation, and in the whole Affair to act with Caution, Prudence and Impartiality. They must especially <HI>ask Counsel</HI> at the Throne of Grace, by devout and fervent <HI>Prayer</HI>; as we have an Example in our Text.</P>
<P>And the Result must be a <HI>general</HI> Union of Hearts in a <HI>free</HI> and <HI>voluntary</HI> Choice, made without any Collusion or Constraint; without all deceitful or vio∣lent Measures, to flatter or force on a Vote for any<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Histories inform (as one observes) That in ancient Times the Choosers of Overseers (or Pastors) gave with their Voice solemn Asseveration or Oath, that their Choice was wholly free, and not the fruit of undue Influence.</NOTE>. A willing Concurrence of the Majority of the Church is necessary, by all the Rules of Society, to a deter∣mining Vote: And the more of Unanimity, the clearer Discovery is made of CHRIST's Mind and Will; especially when Persons of Eminence and Dis∣tinction (for their Gifts and Graces, rather than worldly Abilities) are concurring in the Choice.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There are some things requir'd on the part of the <HI>Candidates</HI> in view, to make them capable Subjects of an Election. There are certain Qualifi∣cations, indispensably necessary to this End, to be respected by the Chusers.</P>
<P>Thus, the <HI>Sex</HI> must be regarded; according to those Apostolic Canons, which we have in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.34, 35. And 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.11, 12.</P>
<P>Again, The <HI>Age</HI> must have some Regard paid to it. Under the <HI>Levitical</HI> Law, they were allow'd to perform Service in the Tabernacle, only from <HI>thirty</HI> years and upwards, until <HI>fifty</HI> years old: Though in <HI>David</HI>'s time Persons were admitted Probationers at <HI>twenty,</HI> and as it shou'd seem stood so for <HI>ten</HI> years. However, this is no Rule now under the Gospel, and
<PB N="22" REF="002871_0024_0FE67EC10DE05A58"/>
I know of no Reason for Persons waiting now till they are <HI>thirty</HI> years old, before they enter upon the Ministry, any more than that they shou'd be discharg'd at <HI>fifty,</HI> as in Jewish days. Yet that ancient Consti∣tution seems to carry so much of Morality and Rea∣son with it, that it appears highly proper, decent and expedient, that atleast Persons be <HI>come to years,</HI> to Men's Estate, before they be chosen into the Ministry.—But I shall not enlarge here; having already given my Sentiments on this head in a Sermon <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Serm. at Mr. <HI>Lowel</HI>'s Ordination, <HI>page 30</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> which some of you have in your hands.</P>
<P>And then a Man's <HI>moral</HI> Character, and <HI>intellectu∣al</HI> Furniture, as well as <HI>Orthodoxy</HI> must be respected. He must be a Person of known Integrity, Capacity, and Fitness. Not only a Man of sufficient Learning, but one <HI>apt to teach,</HI> and <HI>holding fast the faithful Word</HI>; One of unblemish'd Morals and exemplary Piety; One of a meek, humble, and Self-denying Spirit, and indu'd with a good degree of Prudence and Discreti∣on, to <HI>take Care of the Church of GOD,</HI> and secure its Peace and Purity, while he contends earnestly for the Faith, and diligently attends the practical Concerns of Government, Order and Discipline. According to that Apostolical Directory, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. And <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. Which Chapters I commend to serious Consideration at your leisure.</P>
<P>In a word, He ought to be a Person, not only of good Life, and good Abilities, but of a <HI>Ministerial Genius</HI>; regularly inclin'd; dispos'd to the Work, upon proper Motives, <HI>Desiring the Office of a Bishop,</HI> as the Apostle hints, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.1. Indeed a Man may covet the Office, and not be at all qualify'd (as they, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.7.) In which case, an Election to Office is <HI>ipso facto</HI> null and void; being the choice of an incapable Subject. <Q>By previous Qualifications for
<PB N="23" REF="002871_0025_0FE67EC26CF17A58"/>
the Ministry, a general Designation of the Persons to be called to it, is made by CHRIST himself: But where this is <HI>wholly</HI> wanting (says One <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr.</HI> Owen.</NOTE>) it is not in the Power of any Church under Heaven, by virtue of any outward Order or Act, to com∣municate Pastoral or Ministerial Power unto any Person whatever.</Q> So on the other hand, Persons may have a competent portion of Ministerial Gifts; and yet being habitually averse to the Work, and resolutely engag'd for some other Employment, or dispos'd to this only for worldly Ends, if these things be known, it can't be proper to chuse any such: And in either case the Call is not clear. Something like the Spirit of the old Prophets, to whom <HI>the Word of the</HI> LORD, <HI>came</HI> and was in their Hearts <HI>as a burn∣ing Fire,</HI> begetting an ardent Thirst after the Glory of GOD, and good of Souls, is one considerable step towards a Divine Call. Some inward Sense of this seems necessary to make a Man's Call clear to him∣self: And a rational Apprehension of it in the Peo∣ple seems necessary to legitimate their Election. For as the LORD looketh on the <HI>Heart</HI>: So must we, as far as it is discoverable; though still we must beware of uncharitable evil Surmisings. But if a Man plain∣ly discovers a strong Bent to any civil or secular Employment, it is unadvised to make Choice of such an one for the Ministry. Or if he visibly discovers the prevailing grounds of his Inclination to the Mi∣nistry, to be grossly carnal and worldly (as <HI>Eli</HI>'s Pos∣terity, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.36.) can a People safely, or even lawfully, chuse such an one? I may add, if one in general sincerely inclin'd, is invited to this or that particular Station in the Ministry, and cannot find a Heart (even after serious Inquiry and humble Prayer) to comply, I see not that the Call of any
<PB N="24" REF="002871_0026_0FE67EC2930B4A38"/>
People is of such force and obligation, as that he must sin in refusing of it. We find, in a case of some∣what the like nature, even Apostolical Invitations and Intreaties, were in vain with <HI>Apollos</HI>: See 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.12. It is requisite then that a Man have a well-principl'd Disposedness to the Ministry, and to the particular Place where he's invited.</P>
<P>And when there is thus a Sufficiency of Gifts and Qualifications, and a sutable Inclination in the Can∣didate, concurring with an unanimous or general Agreement of a Christian People (both Fraternity and Presbytery) in the Election and Approbation of him; especially if also there be the Concurrence of Neighbour-Elders &amp; Churches; here's such an assem∣blage or conjunction of happy Circumstances, as ren∣ders the Call strong and valid, and seems clearly to point out the Person <HI>whom CHRIST has chosen.</HI> In ordinary cases, the regular Vote of a Church (en∣forc'd by such a general Desire and Agreement on all sides) is look'd upon as the Voice of GOD, by which He calls Men forth to Service in his Church. The good Shepherd so called, may well be said to <HI>enter in by the Door.</HI></P>
<P>But yet,</P>
<P N="2">2. In some <HI>special</HI> Cases, it shou'd seem proper to refer the Matter to a LOT, for Determination; and if this be done in a regular and solemn manner, the Issue may justly be look'd upon as a manifestation of the Will and Mind of CHRIST.</P>
<P>I shall a little particularly insist on this too, because I am so naturally led to it by the <HI>Context,</HI> which tells us that this was the Method in which CHRIST shew'd He had chosen and appointed <HI>Matthias</HI> to be an Apostle.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Nature</HI> of a Lot, I shall only say, The Word may be sometimes used in a lax, and less pro∣per
<PB N="25" REF="002871_0027_0FE67EC92A4A08D8"/>
Sense, for any kind of <HI>Reference</HI> made to GOD, though in a way that implies the Contrivance and Activity of Men, and requires only a Divine Influ∣ence to direct their Thoughts and Powers, in order to the Event. In which sense the <HI>Vote</HI> of any Body of Men, may be call'd a Lot. But yet strictly speak∣ing, the Lot is an awful Appeal to Heaven, in such a way and manner as shuts out human Counsel and Influence, and depends on a special Agency of Di∣vine Providence, for the actual determining of an Event. <HI>Prov.</HI> 16.33. <HI>The Lot is cast into the Lap; but the whole Disposing thereof is of the</HI> LORD. The Judg∣ment's the LORD's. "The Event, though casual to Men, is directed and determin'd by GOD's Counsel and Providence", which controuls and governs in all Cases.</P>
<P>The Lot was an Ordinance of GOD much in Use under the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation, for Decision of Right in uncertain cases, and putting an Issue to weighty Matters depending, which were not with facility de∣terminable in any other way. Thus the Land of <HI>Ca∣naan</HI> was divided to the several Tribes by Lot. (<HI>Numb.</HI> 26.55, 56.) The Scape-goat was chosen by Lot. <HI>(Lev.</HI> 16.7.) The Lot was made use of, in de∣tecting of secret Criminals: as in the case of <HI>Achan</HI> (<HI>Josh.</HI> 7.16.) And of <HI>Jonah</HI> (<HI>Jon.</HI> 1.7.) And of <HI>Jonathan</HI> (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 14.42.) The Method of a Lot was taken to determine the Time, when each Family should bring in their <HI>Quota</HI> of Wood for the Service of the Temple, after the <HI>Jews</HI> Return from their Captivity: And who of the People shou'd go up out of the Villages and Cities of <HI>Judah,</HI> to dwell at <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI> where the Rulers resided, and the House of GOD was in building, and where they wou'd be most expos'd to the Malice and Envy of their Ad∣versaries: It's said, <HI>The People cast Lots, to bring one of Ten, to dwell there. (Neh.</HI> 10.34. <HI>&amp;</HI> 11.1.)</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002871_0028_0FE67EC94D7177A0"/>In a word, this Method was us'd in the Election of Persons to Office; as in the case of <HI>Saul</HI> chosen King of <HI>Israel.</HI> (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10.19 —) So of the <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Leontes,</HI> whom King <HI>David</HI> distributed in∣to many distinct Companies or Courses (as well as the <HI>Militia</HI> of the Kingdom.) <HI>They cast Lots</HI> for every Post and Service, as well the small as the great, ac∣cording to the house of their Fathers; as you have the Account at large in 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 24<HI>th</HI> Chapter and onwards. —</P>
<P>And it's remarkable, the first Election of any Per∣son into Office in the Christian Church (wherein there was any thing of the ordinary Acting or Influ∣ence of Men) <HI>viz.</HI> that which our Text relates to, was consummated or perfected by a Lot. Indeed there was a previous Nomination of Two, by Suffrage or Vote of the whole Multitude: But the Determi∣nation of the particular Person <HI>(whether of these two)</HI> they for very good Reasons put upon a different Is∣sue, and appealed to Heaven by a solemn Lot.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Manner</HI> of this Lot, we are left at an uncertainty: Though some tell us <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Whirby</HI> in loc.</NOTE> "They put two Lots into two Urns, or Ballot-boxes; the one con∣taining the two Names of <HI>Joseph</HI> and <HI>Matthias,</HI> the other the Name of an <HI>Apostle,</HI> and a Blank or void Lot; and then drawing forth the Name of <HI>Joseph</HI> out of one Urn, and the void Lot out of t' her, they knew that the Lot remaining with the Name of an <HI>Apostle</HI> upon it, belong'd to <HI>Matthias.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Reasons</HI> or special Grounds of their cast∣ing the Lot in this case, neither are we particularly inform'd of them. Whether there was any thing in the Nature of the Office, the Person was to be ap∣pointed to; as some are of Opinion, who say, the ultimate Determination of the individual Person, and
<PB N="27" REF="002871_0029_0FE67ECBD327CF00"/>
immediate Disposition of him into his Office, by GOD, was necessary to give him Apostolical Authority: or whether it was done upon no other than the com∣mon moral Reasons, which influenced in the cases above-mention'd, in old Testament-times; I shall not enter into any Debate.</P>
<P>The late excellent Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Expos.</HI> 1 Chro. 24.</NOTE> seems to have been of the Judgment, that the Lot in these cases was <HI>pre∣sidential.</HI></P>
<P>So the memorable Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> whose Words up∣on the place <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> Paraphr.</NOTE> are; <Q>I know no Reason why the— Pastors of the Church (at least in cases of doubt) shou'd not now be <HI>so</HI> chosen,</Q> i. e. by Lot.</P>
<P>What the Judgment and Practice of Antiquity was, I have not had Leisure particularly to inform my self. Only I'll give you a Passage out of <HI>The Order of the Gospel</HI> (by the late venerable Dr. <HI>Mather</HI>) where he has the following words: <Q>Nothing is more evident than that in the first Ages of the Church, Pastors were chosen by all and on∣ly their Flocks: In chusing a Minister, they did <HI>Clerozein,</HI> that is, Chuse him by <HI>Lot</HI>; from whence it was that Ministers had the Name of <HI>Clergy</HI> given to them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 69.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>All I would say upon the Lot in the present Case, give me Leave to offer in the following Hints. And allow me the freedom of young <HI>Elihu,</HI> in saying <HI>Hearken to me, I also will shew my Opinion.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Lawfulness</HI> of a Lot, for determining in this Case, if under a just Regulation, I presume no one will dispute it, that doth allow of the practice in civil Cases. "And it is hardly imaginable that GOD shou'd not have left that lawful, which is so evidently necessary to the Peace and Security of Mankind, and which
<PB N="28" REF="002871_0030_0FE67ECC01A1FBE8"/>
the unavoidable Condition of human Affairs makes of such great and eminent Use to the World."</P>
<P>And now for the <HI>Expediency</HI> of it in Cases sacred, particularly in the present Case, under some spe∣cial Circumstances, which frequently happen, I sup∣pose much might be easily said, and strongly argu'd.</P>
<P>In general, it is a Case of no little <HI>Importance;</HI> such as will bear us out in applying so awful a Me∣thod for Determination. The Lot is a thing <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>reverend</HI>: and to use it in a ludicrous or wanton manner, about Trifles, and Matters of small moment, is a Folly in Israel, judg'd to be no less than <HI>taking the Name of the</HI> LORD <HI>in vain.</HI> But the case before us is of vast weight and solemn consideration: such as calls for the most serious Treatment from Men; and wherein, if in any matter at all (the Honour of CHRIST being so nearly concern'd in it) we may hope that the Lord will own and accept the Appeal made to Him, and give an answer of Peace.</P>
<P>Moreover, It's often a <HI>doubtful</HI> Case, and attended with no small degree of Uncertainty. Many times the case is like that in the Story of our Text: Se∣veral Candidates present, who are very worthy and desirable for their Accomplishments, and so recom∣mend themselves by their public Performances, as well as private Conversation, that a People are will∣ing it shou'd be either of them, and agree it shall be one, or at least suppose it will, and yet scarce know where (many of them) to pitch their ultimate Choice. Now in doubtful cases, what more proper method for Determination than a religious Lot? Indeed in things already determin'd by a clear Revelation of the Mind of CHRIST in holy Scripture, or very appa∣rent to human Reason, and capable of being easily determin'd by a little serious and impartial Conside∣ration; here there's no occasion for such an extraor∣dinary
<PB N="29" REF="002871_0031_0FE67ED2F66775B0"/>
method: And if there be no occasion, it will be judg'd but profane trifling with the Name of CHRIST, to appeal to him by a Lot.—But where there is real Uncertainty, and sober Doubt, or a Variety of Apprehensions among the Parties concern'd in an important Case (important whether in regard of its Nature, or its Consequences) and there be little Pro∣bability of a peaceable Issue by any other means; then cast the Lot, for a Resolution of the Doubt.</P>
<P>In fine, the case before us is many times attend∣ed with a great deal of <HI>Difficulty</HI>; and the divid∣ed Sentiments among a People do too often, for want of some happy means of Accommodation, at last throw them into great Contentions and Disorders.</P>
<P>Among a number of Candidates, there's generally seen a Diversity of Gifts and Talents: And hence, a∣mong a People, as there is a variety of Tastes and Judgments, so in consequence hereof, there's usually a difference of Choice and Inclination; one being determin'd for this, and another for that —. And now as Men are commonly very much dispos'd to be fond of their own Opinion or Fancy; so this by a natural efficacy makes them the more wedded in their Affections, and resolv'd in their Choice; that they can't tell how to brook a Disappointment. Hence they are too often put upon sinister Methods to ob∣tain their Ends: or if balk'd of their Expectations, are carry'd into inordinate Resentments and conten∣tious Measures. Such is the remaining Infirmity in the best and wisest of Men, and such the Subtilty and Power of our grand Adversary the Devil (who goes about, as a roaring Lion, to devour and to dis∣turb) That through the just Judgment and Permissi∣on of Providence, the Peace of the Churches is oft-times miserably broken, in pursuit of unreasonable Prejudices on the one hand, or of a fond Opinion and extravagant Affection on the other; while <HI>they
<PB N="30" REF="002871_0032_0FE67ED31A9B0130"/>
have Men's Persons in Admiration,</HI> so as to be <HI>puffed up for one against another.</HI> And in no case hardly are a People more apt to fall into carnal Contention, than in that before us. <Q>Scarce any thing makes so much Noise, and occasions (for the time) so much sinful Anger and Evil-speaking<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Symmos<HI>'s Life p.</HI> 57.</NOTE>.</Q> Even <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> those eminent Saints and Ser∣vants of CHRIST, differ'd about a <HI>Companion</HI> and Fel∣low-labourer in the Ministry: And the sacred His∣torian tells us <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Act. 15.39.</NOTE> <HI>The Contention was so sharp between them,</HI> that they parted one from the other, and each took his Colleague. So of the Church at <HI>Corinth,</HI> we have the Apostle giving that doleful Account, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.11 — <HI>It hath been declared unto me of you, my Brethren, that there are Contentions among you. Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of</HI> Paul, <HI>and I of</HI> Apol∣lo, <HI>and I of</HI> Cephas <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Again, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3.3, 4. <HI>For whereas there is among you Envying, and Strife, and Divisions; are ye not carnal, and walk according to Men? For while one saith, I am of</HI> Paul, <HI>and another, I am of</HI> Apollo, <HI>are ye not carnal?</HI> — And in our Days, O! how much is there of this Carnality to be seen among Professors; this spirit of party and facti∣on, <HI>the leven of malice and wickedness</HI>! How often have Churches been almost rent to pieces by scan∣dalous Quarrels about the Settlement of a Minister; to the great Dishonour of Religion, to the Reproach of our Profession, and to the Gratification of them that malign our Ecclesiastical Constitution, and envy us our happy Rights and Privileges! For want of a wise Conduct, popular Votes and Choices are too often attended with ungodly Strifes and Emulations. Now as the Apostle observes, Where <HI>Envying and Strife</HI> prevail, there is <HI>Confusion</HI> and <HI>every evil work.</HI> And then such Divisions are difficult to be heal'd.
<PB N="31" REF="002871_0033_0FE67ED465CC6FF8"/>
We may apply here that of <HI>Solomon, — A Brother offended, is harder to be won than a sirong City, and their Contentions are like the Bars of a Castle.</HI> Hence then in this critical case it greatly behoves a People to <HI>study</HI> for Quietness, to <HI>follow</HI> the Things that make for <HI>Peace</HI>; and if it be possible, manage so as to secure this. <HI>The beginning of Strife, is as when one letteth out Water</HI>: When it has got some little Vent, it will it self widen the Breach, and in a little time grow irresistible, if speedy care be not taken to put a stop to it. <HI>Therefore</HI> says the wise Man, <HI>leave off Contention before it be meddled with.</HI></P>
<P>Now, what more effectual Method to this End, (that is, to leave off Contention <HI>before</HI> it be meddled with) can be us'd, in the present case, than that of a religious <HI>Lot?</HI> The Lot, every one that has any thing in him serious, looks upon as sacred and vene∣rable. The very Pagans yous find in the case of <HI>Jo∣nah,</HI> paying a profound Reverence to the Lot, as carrying in it something peculiarly Divine. Here GOD is beheld as sitting in Judgment: And the Awe of this will have the strongest Influence, of any Reflection in the World, to restrain Men's turbu∣lent Passions, and suppress those fretful Resentments that so frequently break out upon a Disappointment, when we eye only the hand of Men in it. The less there is of Man, and the more of GOD is seen, in any affair, the greater Content shall we take in the Issue. — <HI>What was I that I shou'd withstand GOD! — Lest haply ye be found even to fight against GOD!</HI></P>
<P>The Apostle observes, <HI>An Oath</HI> for Confirmation, is to Men an <HI>End of all Strife.</HI> And agreeable is that Remark of <HI>Solomon,</HI> Prov. 18.18. <HI>The</HI> Lot <HI>caus∣eth Contentions to cease,</HI> and <HI>parteth between the mighty.</HI> Here the Wise Man hints the <HI>right</HI> application of the Lot, <HI>viz.</HI> In difficult and doubtful Cases, to pre∣vent or end Contentions. <Q>By telling us what <HI>is</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="002871_0034_0FE67ED48D27B4D0"/>
done, he tells us what <HI>ought</HI> to be done, in such Cases. Then a Lot is lawfully us'd, when it ei∣ther preserveth or procureth Peace and Equity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dod</HI> &amp; Cl. in loc.</NOTE>.</Q> And as to the <HI>Efficacy</HI> of this Method, you have not only the Wise Man's Testimony, but the concurrent Suffrage of common Reason, and universal Expe∣rience.</P>
<P>Hence, upon such Views and Considerations as these, it seems a high Propriety (at least in some Cases) to take the Method of a Lot, in the Choice of a Minister: Which will make it more emphatically a Divine Choice, and have a happy Tendency to set∣tle the Minds of Men, and adjust all Disputes where there are contending Parties.</P>
<P>But then in this Method there are several Provi∣soes &amp; Limitations to be carefully observ'd. Parti∣cularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. It seems necessary that some <HI>certain Candidates</HI> be singled out, and nominated, by general Consent in a voluntary Vote: (For this you have the Ex∣ample of the Church who <HI>appointed Two,</HI> in order to the Lot for an Apostle) Which will effectually secure the privilege and liberty of the Body Ecclesi∣astic, to all good Intents and Purposes.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is necessary that the Persons in view, be <HI>su∣tably qualify'd</HI>: — I do not say <HI>equally</HI> in all respects, but each of them in some agreeable measure. — For It must be a lawful and justifiable Case, in which the Lot is us'd. And therefore it must not be cast for any that are apparently incapable Subjects of Election: Because there is no uncertainty here. If either of the Persons propos'd are known to be dis∣qualify'd by any essential Defects, whether in point of Knowledge, Faith, or Morals; it is but a profane mocking and tempting of CHRIST, to draw the Lot:
<PB N="33" REF="002871_0035_0FE67EDC81607290"/>
and therefore unlawful to put the Matter to such an Issue. It is but as <HI>Haman</HI>'s Lot for the chusing some lucky day to accomplish a wicked Design: Or as the <HI>Soldiers</HI> impious Lot for our SAVIOUR's seamless Coat (so fam'd for its miraculous Virtue) which cou'd give none of them a just Propriety.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Lot must be employ'd in a <HI>solemn</HI> and <HI>re∣ligious</HI> manner.</P>
<P>Being a practical Appeal to Heaven, it's but fit the Matter shou'd be transacted in a serious frame, <HI>after a godly sort.</HI> The Lot is too awful a thing to be dally'd with. It must not be us'd rashly, and in a light and lusory way; but with Deliberation, Seri∣ousness, and Solemnity. And 'tis highly fitting this sacred Transaction shou'd be accompany'd with de∣vout <HI>Prayer</HI>; at least Ejaculatory, and in such Cases of Importance as that before us, with more solemn Sup∣plications. At the Division of the Land among the Children of Israel, it's observ'd, <HI>Joshua</HI> cast Lots for them in <HI>Shiloh, before the Lord</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Josh. 18.10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And now if the Lot be thus regulated, the Success may (I think) in Faith be committed to Divine Providence: And the Event may well be look'd up∣on as an incontestible Discovery of the Mind of CHRIST; <HI>shewing</HI> hereby <HI>whether of these He hath cho∣sen.</HI> I cou'd never yet see why in such a Case we mayn't now-a-days, as they did in old time, expect the special Interposition of Heaven, to <HI>give a perfect Lot</HI>: As King <HI>Saul</HI> pray'd to the LORD GOD of Israel, in the Case depending between Him and his Son on one side, and the People on the other<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 14.41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Indeed the Religious Lot is grown much out of Custom; though the Civil be retain'd and in fre∣quent Use: yet the Divisory Lot, more than the
<PB N="34" REF="002871_0036_0FE67EDCA0097638"/>
Elective. But why the Lot is so disus'd in matters spi∣ritual and ecclesiastical, I can at present think of no better or truer Reason than the common Abuses and Profanations of it in other cases. It is generally own'd, The Lot may lawfully be us'd about <HI>civil</HI> Concerns, where weighty Consequences are in prospect, and where unhappy Differences can't well be prevented or issu'd any other way. Yet even here, whatsoever is more than this, <HI>comes of Evil.</HI> The Lot is a virtu∣al Calling upon GOD the LORD, to direct and de∣termine us: And therefore to employ this religious Rite, in cases that are plain and clear, beyond all rational Dispute, or in frivolous, much more in sportive Matters, is by Divines judg'd unlawful, as making too bold with Providence. And the custo∣mary unhallow'd use of it in trivial Plays and Pas∣times (with the too unserious, and perhaps often un∣necessary Application of it in many Affairs of Life) appears to me the most obvious Reason why it is fallen into Disuse in sacred Things. 'Tis owing to the Subtilty and Influence of an Hellish Tempter, that the Lot is so desecrated and perverted, in a sen∣sual sportful World. As one observes; <Q>GOD hath his Ordinances: the Devil has his. GOD hath Sacraments for his People: the Devil has his. Is the <HI>Oath</HI> GOD's Ordinance? In Affront to this, the Devil set up profane Swearing, to les∣sen the Authority and Veneration of a sacred Oath. So is the <HI>Lot</HI> GOD's Ordinance? Herein also the Enemy sows his Tares: and to affront GOD in this Ordinance of his, he has his gaming and sportive Lotteries. That there may be no Religion in the use of Lots [and that the Lot mayn't be apply'd to the Service of Religion] the Devil has turn'd them all into Play</Q> and Di∣version, or a method of Gain and Profit, or into Su∣perstition, Bible-Lottery (as it is call'd) and Sorcery
<PB N="35" REF="002871_0037_0FE67EDE0D0F9508"/>
or Divination. However, the frequent <HI>Abuse</HI> and Misapplication of a thing, capable of being directed to so excellent purposes, as the Lot is, doth not at all forbid the <HI>regular</HI> Improvement of it: And I can't see why it mayn't be as safely and profitably em∣ploy'd in sacred Cases (where it seems indeed the most proper and needful) now as ever. Nor can I see why the <HI>Lot</HI> shou'd be laid aside, on the Account of vulgar Abuses, any more than the <HI>Oath</HI>; which though as much prostituted and as often violated, is notwithstanding made use of still, without any Scruple, and with good Success, as <HI>an End of Strife.</HI></P>
<P>You may observe, I go very much on rational Grounds; and build not upon Scripture only: Tho' if this directs to a Lot, in any Case, I think it is sufficient Authority, were there no such evident Grounds in Reason for it. But I have enlarg'd here, on a too uncultivated Subject, much further than was at first intended. I shut up this head with that free Address of <HI>Elihu</HI> to his worthy Fathers, the three Friends of <HI>Job</HI>; — <HI>Hear, O ye wise Men, and give Ear, ye that have Knowledge. For the Ear trieth Words, as the Mouth tasteth Meat. Let us chuse to us Judgment: let us know among our selves what is good.</HI></P>
<P>I hasten now to the last thing under the Doctrine, which is —</P>
<P N="3">III. To say <HI>Why</HI> it ought to be the <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>De∣sire</HI> of a People, in the Case before us, that CHRIST wou'd <HI>shew</HI> whom He hath chosen.</P>
<P>And here I shall only hint,</P>
<P>In the first place, It's but <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>reasonable,</HI> that He shou'd have the Chusing of his own Servants; and is <HI>desirable</HI> that Such shou'd be put into the Ministry, whom <HI>he approves,</HI> and will own and bless.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="002871_0038_0FE67EDE2F5C92A0"/>He is the Fountain of all Power: and may lodge it in whose hands he pleaseth. He has instituted the several Offices in the Church: And 'tis his Pro∣vince, as Head and Lord, to fill them with his Ser∣vants; whom, and in what way he pleaseth.</P>
<P><Q>As the <HI>Ordinances</HI> must be only such as are of <HI>his</HI> Institution: So the <HI>Dispensers</HI> of them must be such as are of his Designation; else they can't expect his Presence to be with them. The LORD once complain'd of some Prophets, That <HI>they ran,</HI> and <HI>He did not send them:</HI> Of whom He declares (which is threatning enough) That therefore <HI>they should not profit the People at all,</HI> Jer. 23.21, 32.</Q> It is a dreadful thing to sit under the Preaching and Administrations of a Man, whom we can't see CHRIST bearing Testimony to, by a special Blessing on his Labours, or any visible Tokens of his spiritual Pre∣sence with him.</P>
<P>Hence it's a very reasonable Care, when a People are concern'd and desirous, that CHRIST wou'd shew whom He has chosen. It's fit his Will shou'd be done, his Counsel take place; and to be desir'd that his good Pleasure may be known.</P>
<P>Again, Consider, CHRIST is infinitely <HI>Wise,</HI> and a∣ble to make the <HI>best</HI> Choice for a People. We may imagine him looking upon them, and saying (as in <HI>Jer.</HI> 49.19.) <HI>Who is a chosen Man that I may ap∣point over</HI> them? <HI>For who is like Me?</HI> — Who's like Me, for chusing the fittest Instruments, and spiriting them for their Work? — We may allude to <HI>Rev.</HI> 17.14. <HI>He is LORD of Lords; and they that are with Him, are called, and chosen, and faithful.</HI> As He will accept none but such as are of his own Ap∣pointment: So He perfectly foreknows whom He will own and bless. <HI>Job.</HI> 13.18. <HI>I know whom I have chosen.</HI> Hence He said to <HI>Ananias</HI> concerning <HI>Saul,</HI> against whom that Disciple had entertained very
<PB N="37" REF="002871_0039_0FE67EE4E62797E8"/>
great (and once just) Prejudices, as you read, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.13 &amp;c. <HI>Ananias</HI> objected, <HI>Lord, I have heard by many of this Man, how much Evil he hath done</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way; for he is a chosen Vessel unto me to bear my Name before the</HI> Gen∣tiles. We may be apt to throw aside this or t'other, as a <HI>despised Lamp</HI>; when to the LORD he may be a <HI>Chosen Vessel.</HI> We shou'd gladly therefore refer it to his Wisdom, to determine for us; and be sollici∣tous that he wou'd shew whom He has chosen. Thus we shall put Honour on his wise and sovereign Providence.</P>
<P>In a word, Thus we shall consult <HI>our own Interest and Peace.</HI> For a People will be more dispos'd to re∣ceive Such in the Lord with all gladness, and hold them in Reputation, whom they see CHRIST shewing He hath chosen. Whatever Objections <HI>Ananias</HI> had against <HI>Saul</HI>; yet when he heard those Words, <HI>He is a chosen Vessel unto me,</HI> the good Man instantly embrac'd him as a <HI>Brother,</HI> with great Affection. And this will have a natural and (by the Divine Blessing) a powerful Tendency to a People's profit∣ing by the Ministry of such an one. — And then this will afford no small Consolation to the People of GOD, as it is to them an evident Token of Salvation; a happy sign of the Lord's Presence with them; that his Spirit remains among them, and that his King∣dom shall be still upheld in the midst of them. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 34.29, 30. <HI>I will raise up for them a Plant of Renown. Thus shall they know, that I the</HI> LORD <HI>their GOD am with them; and that they, even the house of</HI> Israel, <HI>are my People, saith the</HI> LORD <HI>GOD.</HI></P>
<P>For these and other Reasons, it shou'd be the Care and Concern of a People, who have before them the Choice of a Minister; That the LORD wou'd <HI>shew whom He hath chosen,</HI> whom he hath appointed, and will approve. This was the Sollicitude and De∣sire
<PB N="38" REF="002871_0040_0FE67EE50A278490"/>
of the Church and the Apostles, in the Case our Text refers to; and this Record was made of it for the Admonition of all Posterity. For whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>ensample.</HI></P>

<P>And they prayed, and said, Thou Lord, which knowest the Hearts of all Men, shew whether of these — Thou hast chosen; that he may take part of this Ministry —.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Subject we were upon in the Morning was, That when some one is wanted to supply a Vacancy in the Ministry, it shou'd be the sollicitous Desire of all concern'd, That the LORD JESUS CHRIST wou'd shew whom He hath chosen.</P>
<P>I come now to another Observation from the Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. II. In the important Affair of calling a Mi∣nister, <HI>Application shou'd be made to the</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST, <HI>by fervent Prayer,</HI> expressing the Concern and Desire of our Souls, that He wou'd shew whom He hath chosen.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="002871_0041_0FE67EE68CBA1E20"/>So in our Text, <HI>They prayed and said</HI> —</P>
<P>Prayer is a devout offering up of our regular Desires to the Throne of Grace. It shou'd not only be our <HI>Hearts Desire,</HI> but our <HI>Prayer</HI> also, That CHRIST wou'd shew us whom He hath chosen.</P>
<P>Here we might observe,</P>
<P>The LORD JESUS CHRIST (the Son of GOD) is together with the FATHER and HOLY GHOST, the pro∣per Object of religious Worship. He has all those Divine Perfections, and sustains all those Divine Re∣lations, Titles and Characters, which proclaim him the worthy Object of our Faith, Love, Prayer and Praise, in their most exalted Sense, and highest Ex∣ercises. And to Him should our Prayers sometimes be <HI>immediately</HI> directed; if we wou'd honour the SON, even as we honour the FATHER. The Protomartyr <HI>Stephen</HI> in his dying moments pray'd to <HI>the Lord JESUS.</HI> And in our Text, we have the Apostles and an Assembly of the first Disciples, uniting their solemn Supplications to Him. — The Title, LORD, is the special Title of CHRIST; his constant Style, throughout the New Testament. And it was customa∣ry among the primitive Christians to make their reli∣gious Addresses unto Him; insomuch that they were characteris'd, and distinguish'd from <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Hea∣then,</HI> by their <HI>Calling upon the Name of the</HI> LORD JESUS<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Act. 9.14. Rom. 10.12. 1 Cor. 1.2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There are some special Cases, wherein it seems pe∣culiarly proper and congruous, distinctly to invocate the LORD JESUS CHRIST. Thus, particularly in the Administration of the LORD's <HI>Supper,</HI> which is of his Institution, and bears his Name, and the primary De∣sign whereof is to do honour to his Memory, by a grateful Celebration of his redeeming Love. So in the <HI>Election</HI> (as well as in the <HI>Ordination</HI>) of Per∣sons,
<PB N="40" REF="002871_0042_0FE67EE6AEE1A5E0"/>
to serve CHRIST in the Ministry, it seems equal∣ly proper, that the Name of the LORD JESUS shou'd be expresly and immediately call'd upon.</P>
<P>Now, if you ask <HI>What</HI> is to be requested of Him, in such a Case; I answer in general, as in our Text, <HI>That He would shew whom He hath chosen:</HI> — (Imply∣ing) That he wou'd chuse for us in great Mercy, and that he wou'd discover his Mind and Will to us, in those ways in which it may be expected: That he wou'd preside and govern in the Choice propos'd by us; influence our Views and Resolutions, and cause a Coincidence of all things to the accomplish∣ment of his own Counsel), and bringing the Affair to a happy Result: That all matters of Controversy be∣tween Him and us may be remov'd, and no Obstruc∣tions lie in the way to hinder a Blessing from being bestow'd upon us: That when the Lot is cast into the Lap, there may be a gracious Disposal thereof, by his Power and Wisdom; that the Lot may fall upon One, who shall be a Pastor <HI>according to his Heart</HI>; One whom He hath <HI>called by his Grace,</HI> and will delight to bless and prosper. — This may be the Tenour and Scope of our Prayers on such an Occasion.</P>
<P>And if you ask <HI>Why</HI> we shou'd thus employ Pray∣er in the Case? I answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. Our LORD himself has <HI>directed</HI> us to this Method. Besides that Prayer is the appointed way for obtain∣ing all the Benefits we desire. It's particularly pre∣scrib'd in the Case before us; 'Tis imply'd in that direction to the Disciples, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9.38. <HI>Pray ye the Lord of the Harvest, that He will send forth Labourers into his Harvest.</HI> — It is observable, the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> frequently and pathetically desir'd the Prayers of this and the other Church whom he purpos'd to visit;
<PB N="41" REF="002871_0043_0FE67EEB1645C840"/>
<HI>That he might come to them with Joy by the Will of GOD</HI> &amp;c. (See <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.30 — 32. So <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.18, 19.) Which Directions will very well take in the present Case, by parity of Reason. Now this is Argument enough, in any Case: 'Tis the Wil of GOD in CHRIST JESUS concerning you.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Example</HI> in our Text shou'd have it's influ∣ence upon us. They had their Eyes to the LORD for a Decision from his special Providence, and they lift∣ed up a Frayer: wherein they have left a good Copy for future Ages to imitate. The Apostle said (<HI>Phil.</HI> 3.17.) <HI>Ye have us for an Ensample.</HI> So (2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3.7.) <HI>Your selves know how ye ought to follow us.</HI> And doubt∣less the sacred Historian put the Prayer in our Text on Record, to make the Apostles and primitive Church an Ensample unto us to follow them. As the bad Actions of Men are related in Scripture-Story, for our Admonition and Warning: So the good and laudable Actions of the Saints are story'd, not only for their Commendation, but for our Imita∣tion and Learning. Hence we are exhorted to be <HI>Followers of them who through faith and patience inhe∣rit the Promises.</HI> Heb. 6.12.</P>
<P N="3">3. 'Tis a Case wherein we have special <HI>Declarations and Promises</HI> of CHRIST, to plead, and to animate our Faith, in Prayer on this Occasion.</P>
<P>'Tis a virtual Promise we have in <HI>Psal.</HI> 68.18. <HI>Thou hast ascended on high; — Thou hast received Gifts for Men; yea for the Rebellious also, that the Lord GOD might dwell among them.</HI> Which Gifts (as the Apostle expounds the Psalmist, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.11.) par∣ticularly mean sutable Instruments for the Work of the Ministry. Such Gifts CHRIST has receiv'd, to be bestow'd on his Church and People, as the visible Signs and Means of his gracious Presence in the midst of them. This affords one advantageous Plea. And we may put in suit that precious Promise, <HI>Isai.</HI> 20.30.
<PB N="42" REF="002871_0044_0FE67EEB392A5E70"/>
<HI>Though the Lord give you the bread of Adversity — Yet thine Eyes shall see thy Teachers</HI> &amp;c. Also that, <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.14, 15. <HI>Turn, O backsliding Children; for I am mar∣ried to you; — And I will give you Pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</HI> GOD expects that we in faith convert these Promises into Petitions and Pleas at the Throne of Grace. As you may learn from <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.37. Where, after various Promises made, it is added, <HI>Thus saith the</HI> LORD; <HI>yet for this will I be enquired by the house of Israel to do it for them.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The Gift we receive in <HI>answer to Prayer,</HI> we may hope will prove a <HI>Blessing indeed,</HI> in which we shall rejoyce.</P>
<P>Usually, the Benefits we receive by Prayer, are doubly sweet and pleasant. 'Twas a most comforta∣ble Reflection to pious <HI>Hannah, For this Child I prayed.</HI> So when it may be reflected, For this Mi∣nister I pray'd, how great the Consolation! —When the LORD, by any satisfying Evidences, sheweth whom He has chosen, as it will afford peculiar En∣couragement to the Person to accept the Call: so it will by a natural efficacy help us to attend on the Ministry of such an one with a greater Faith and li∣velier Hope for a special Benediction of Heaven up∣on his Administrations and Labours among us. Such a Minister may humbly triumph, with the Apostle, as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.29. <HI>I am sure, that when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of CHRIST.</HI> And a People so highly favoured, may make that the Song of their grateful Souls; <HI>Psal.</HI> 65.14. <HI>Praise waiteth for Thee, O GOD, in Sion: — Bles∣sed is the Man whom thou chusest, — we shall be satis∣fy'd with the Goodness of thy House.</HI> So <HI>Psal.</HI> 118.21, 26. I will praise the Lord, <HI>for thou hast heard me. — Bles∣sed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: We have blessed you out of the House of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="002871_0045_0FE67EEE1A3B4560"/>I shall only add, by way of Argument,</P>
<P N="5">5. 'Tis a very <HI>concerning</HI> Case; in which it ex∣ceedingly behoves a People to chuse well, and is very awful to commit an Error. — It's but fit all Business of any moment shou'd be carry'd on with Prayer. How much more the very important Busi-of Calling a Minister! It's a great Affair of CHRIST's Kingdom, and important Concern of his Glory. — It is of vast Moment to our Souls, and has a near As∣pect on the best Interests of our dear Posterity. An Error here will be of dangerous Tendency, and extensive Influence. — And then 'tis a very critical Case; in which without CHRIST's special Direction and Leading, we shall certainly commit egregious Mistakes, and run into Confusions: shall be in danger of laying on Hands <HI>suddenly,</HI> and so of being <HI>partak∣ers of other Men's Sins.</HI> For (as one observes) <Q>Whoever have a sinful hand in the Choice of an unskilful and unfaithful Pastor, are so far guilty of all the Hurt he doth, and shall answer to GOD for the Blood of the Souls, which perish through his Mismanagement. Their Sin in this Case, maketh way for the <HI>Hireling</HI>; and so hath Influ∣ence upon all the Harm he doth.</Q> There shou'd be a holy Sollicitude then, lest we take any false Steps, or fall upon any wrong Measures, or come in∣to any unhappy Resolves: but that all be done to the Glory of GOD, and with the Security of the common Good.</P>
<P>Hence, it will be our Wisdom to put the Affair under our LORD's Conduct; and not lean to our own Understandings, nor trust in our own Hearts. <HI>Commit thy Works to the Lord: So shall thy thoughts be established.</HI> Make thy Prayer unto Him, and He will hear thee: Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be establish'd unto thee; and the <HI>light shall shine upon thy ways.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="002871_0046_0FE67EEE403B6AF0"/>These Reflections afford very strong and moving Arguments for Prayer on the solemn Occasion before us.</P>
<P>But then, if we expect an Answer of Peace, we must see to it, that we offer the <HI>Prayer of Faith,</HI> and lift up holy Hands; without Wrath and Doubting. In many Cases, it may be said, <HI>Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss.</HI> Let us every one think with the Psalmist, If I regard Iniquity in my Heart, the Lord will not hear me. — Verily let not that Man, who is of a double heart, imagine that he shall receive any thing of the LORD. We must ask <HI>in Faith</HI>; embracing the Promises, and realizing CHRIST's Sufficiency and Faithfulness to perform them. — Yet we must ask <HI>humbly</HI>; sensible of our utter unworthi∣ness; confessing our Sins, and putting all our Ini∣quities from us. — In a word, we must pray <HI>fer∣vently,</HI> and with a holy Importunity, as those that know the Worth and Moment of the Gift we are asking of our ascended LORD. — Every one concern'd, shou'd wrestle for it in fervent Prayer by himself in secret. And every Family apart. And the Con∣gregation of the LORD; making Mention of it al∣ways in their common Prayers, &amp; uniting in solemn ex∣traordinary Supplications (as they in our Text) on so weighty an Occasion.</P>
<P>It has been the laudable practice of these Church∣es, to have their Days of Fasting and public Prayer, when meditating the Choice of a Minister: Which Days, I wou'd observe, shou'd be kept seasonably (in general, the earlier the better) before the Thoughts and Resolves of a People are particularly fix'd and terminated.</P>
<P>Now, let us every one <HI>reflect</HI> a little on <HI>our</HI> Con∣duct in this Matter. Have we been thus employing Faith and Prayer, with regard to the Choice before us. 'Tis true, when we had our Church-<HI>Fast</HI> upon
<PB N="45" REF="002871_0047_0FE67EF50ED89920"/>
upon Occasion of the Removal of our late worthy <HI>Pastor</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The Rev. Mr. <HI>BENJAMIN WADSWORTH;</HI> who being chosen Presi∣dent of <HI>Harvard-College,</HI> and Application thereupon made by the Hon. and Rev. the Overseers, for the Church's Consent to part with him for that Service; the Church after humble Prayer, with serious Considera∣tion and previous Inquiry into his Mind upon this weighty Affair, voted a conditional Compliance; Resolving, <Q>That if he judg'd it his Duty to accept of the Call given him, We would humbly submit, and say, THE WILL OF THE LORD BE DONE!</Q> Which Vote was pass'd <HI>June 16. 1725.</HI> With a considerable degree of Unanimity, as it pleased the <HI>LORD</HI> then to dispose our Hearts; and with no small Appearances of a very solemn Awe upon every one's Spirit: together with the sensi∣ble workings of a just and great Affection to our faithful Pastor, and the visible Tokens of a special Divine Conduct and Influence; the appre∣hension of which, as it gave a general Satisfaction, so it was my Relief under the Anxieties of that critical Juncture; and in the Days of doubt∣ful Expectation which have since rolled over us, that Reflection has oft refreshed the Bowels of many; particularly by furnishing us with an Argument or Plea in Prayer, and encouraging our Hopes, That the <HI>LORD</HI> who had called his Servant from us, and who hath the Residue of the Spirit, wou'd lead and influence in the Choice of a Successor; to preserve Peace and Truth, and provide graciously for us —.</P><P>Not long after the President's Instalment, and actual going from us, the Church at an occasional Meeting, saw fit (among other things) unanimously to agree upon keeping a Day of Prayer, with a special View to the remarkable Change of Circumstances we were now come under. Upon this great Occasion <Q>Judging our selves called to extraordinary Prayer, It was therefore resolved (GOD willing) that we would speedily keep a day of Fasting together, to beg of GOD a sancti∣fied Use of so important a Dispensation; and that He wou'd teach us the way wherein we ought to go, and in his good Time provide for us another Pastor according to his own Heart.</Q> — The said Fast was on <HI>Aug. 17.</HI> following.</P><P>I have thought it not amiss, to gratify the Publick, by this particular Account of that Affair, and our proceedings upon it.</P></NOTE> from us unto another important Post, We did unitedly spread our Case before the LORD; and have at our occasional Meetings, as well as upon the LORD's day, from time to time been humbly moving our blessed SAVIOUR and Head to look upon in our present State and supply our Wants: But have we all likewise in our private Requests been conti∣nually
<PB N="46" REF="002871_0048_0FE67EF52E35AA88"/>
making mention of our Case, and begging Divine Appearances for us, with a suitable Concern and Fervour of Soul! Can our Closets and our Fami∣lies testify on our behalf, that we have been giving our selves to Prayer; beseiging the Throne of Grace day and night with our ardent Cries, and believing Intreaties, that the LORD wou'd <HI>shew us</HI> (among all the Candidates we have heard) <HI>whether of these He hath chosen?</HI> Or have we been contenting our selves with a few prayerless Thoughts and Endeavours? Have we not been cold and indifferent, and too un∣thinking? Or else all our Care and Zeal too inde∣vout, irreligious, and not accompany'd with a spirit of prayer and resignation to GOD?</P>
<P>Surely it is fit we examine into our Temper &amp; Conduct here. This becomes us, as Men and as Christians. And then this is necessary for the better ordering our Expectations and Hopes. For if we have sought the LORD humbly and earnestly, we may look He will be found of us. Since he hath assur'd us, as in <HI>Mat.</HI> 18.19. <HI>Again I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in hea∣ven.</HI> But if we have been casting off Fear and re∣straining Prayer, while we have pursu'd our several Aims and Desires; we may justly expect He will hide his Face from us, and cover our Paths with Darkness.</P>
<P>Hence then (whatever our personal Managements and Dispositions have been) let us <HI>now</HI> stir up our selves to seek the Lord by importunate Prayer. Ye that make mention of his Name, call upon him in the Day-time, and in the Night, keep not Silence before Him. In∣treat his Favour with your whole Heart, and give Him no rest, until he shew whom He has chosen; until He restore the Smiles of his Face on his Sanctu∣ary, which is so far desolate, and set up a burning
<PB N="47" REF="002871_0049_0FE67EF6824B47C0"/>
and shining Light in this his Candlestick. Let the Prophet's Resolution be ours, <HI>Isai.</HI> 62.1. <HI>For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest until the Righteousness thereof go forth as Brightness, and her Salvation as a Lamp that burn∣eth.</HI> — Thus we shall be prepar'd to receive the Bles∣sing from the LORD, and to give Him the Glory and the Praise.</P>
<P>But I hasten to the last Observation.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT. III.</HI> CHRIST is at all times and in all Affairs, especially in the present important Case, to be con∣sidered by us as <HI>the LORD, who knoweth the hearts of all Men. — So in the Text,</HI> Thou LORD, which knowest the Hearts of all Men, shew whether of these Thou hast chosen.</P>
<P>Here I might (not unprofitably) go into the <HI>Proof</HI> of CHRIST's Dominion and Omniscience, that he <HI>is</HI> LORD, and that he doth know the hearts of all Men; and doctrinally treat upon the exalted Title and relative Perfection here ascrib'd to our blessed SAVIOUR; which indeed are none other than the in∣communicable Prerogatives of JEHOVAH; the high Glories and appropriate Characters of the Supreme and Infinite Mind<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>N. B.</HI> There were some distinct <HI>Enlargements</HI> upon these Heads in the Discourse given from the Pulpit, which are here left out, only for brevity sake to accommodate the Reader.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But it is the <HI>practical Improvement,</HI> to be made of these Reflections, which I mainly aim at. And they are very applicable, to regulate our Views, and go∣vern our Tempers and Deportments; as in all other Affairs, so particularly in the present Case. — Hence the Church in our Text, prayed, saying, <HI>Thou Lord, which knowest the hearts of all Men</HI> —. Doubtless it
<PB N="48" REF="002871_0050_0FE67EF6A5120168"/>
was not without a special Direction of the HOLY GHOST, that they fixed on this particular Property, and this Tide of CHRIST, in their Invocation; where∣by were ministred unto them those pious Reflections, that probably had an excellent Influence into the whole Conduct of the Affair. And it may be of no small benefit to a People in the like Case, to make use of and apply these affecting Idea's of CHRIST.</P>
<P N="1">I. A due consideration of CHRIST as the LORD, may be of very profitable Consequence, in the ma∣nagement of the Affair before us.</P>
<P>To give a few hints here distinctly.</P>
<P N="1">1. This will teach us, from a <HI>Reverence to the Office</HI> of the Ministry, as the Institution of CHRIST our Glo∣rious LORD, to treat the Affair of chusing and calling a Person to that Office, with a becoming <HI>Seriousness</HI> and <HI>Solemnity.</HI></P>
<P>Is CHRIST the LORD? We should then fear before him, and make Him our Dread. His Name is holy and reverend: And all that wears the stamp of his Authority, should appear venerable to us. The LORD's Day, the LORD's Supper, his Word, his Peo∣ple, should be call'd <HI>the Holy of the LORD, Honour∣able.</HI> So the LORD's Ministers should be highly es∣teemed in Love, and their Office held in Reputation by all such as wou'd honour JESUS CHRIST our LORD, both theirs and ours. For he has said to his Ministers, <HI>He that despiseth you, despiseth Me.</HI> — A reverent re∣gard to the Institution of CHRIST, shou'd teach us to treat all Affairs relating to the Ministry, and in par∣ticular to behave our selves in the important Work before us, with the greatest Gravity, with solemn Thought, a deep Awe, and religious Concern.</P>
<P N="2">2. The serious Consideration of CHRIST as LORD, will help to <HI>regulate</HI> our <HI>Aims,</HI> and <HI>guide</HI> our <HI>Choice.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="002871_0051_0FE67EFDA0802120"/>It will influence us to consult the Glory of our LORD; to do all in the Name of CHRIST, and study to manage so as to secure his Honour, and promote his Interest, I may allude to some of the Apostle's Words, and say, He that realises the Dominion of CHRIST, <HI>will care for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord.</HI> In the electing of a Mi∣nister, that Consideration will terminate our Views on such a Person as we do deliberately and upon ra∣tional Grounds judge will be most acceptable to CHRIST, and most likely to be a special Instrument of his Praise: One that is not only capacitated by a due portion of Gifts and Powers, to serve the Interest and Kingdom of CHRIST; but whose Heart is (visi∣bly to us) set right with GOD, and bound for his Glory. It will tend to make this our governing Aim; and transport us above the corrupt Influence of carnal or sinister Regards, the unhappy Results of a vicious Self-Love.</P>
<P N="3">3. It will point us to the <HI>Word</HI> of CHRIST, as our <HI>Rule,</HI> in fixing our Judgment, and conducting the whole Business before us.</P>
<P>It will lead us to consult the Scriptures for Direc∣tion, and to take Counsel from them, in managing this Affair of CHRIST's Kingdom. It will influence us to attend to the inspired Apostle, as if CHRIST the LORD spake to us, where he describes the Evangeli∣cal Bishop, and sets down Rules for chusing a <HI>good Minister</HI> of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>And it will preserve in us a just Concern, through the intire process of the Affair, to demean our selves with a strict Conformity to the reveal'd Will of CHRIST; that we may carry it as <HI>becometh the Gospel,</HI> and walk <HI>worthy of the LORD,</HI> unto all pleasing.</P>
<P N="4">4. It will direct us to go to CHRIST with our <HI>Pray∣ers,</HI> and our <HI>Thanksgivings,</HI> for Success.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="002871_0052_0FE67EFDC679B318"/>It is a Motive to earnest <HI>Prayer,</HI> and will put each one upon applying to CHRIST, in that humble Lan∣guage, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.6. <HI>Lord, what wilt Thou have me to do?</HI> It directs and excites us to be looking unto JESUS who is the Author and Finisher of every hap∣py Settlement; and to be intreating his Favour, his Conduct, Assistance and Blessing. — Also it teaches us to be <HI>thankful</HI> to <HI>him</HI> for Prosperity in our Endea∣vours; to give him the Glory, if we succeed, who is LORD over all, and governs second Causes after his sovereign Pleasure. Hence that of <HI>Ezra, By the good hand of our GOD upon us,</HI> they brought us a Man of Understanding, a Minister for the house of our GOD, <HI>Ezra</HI> 8.18.</P>
<P N="5">5. It may be improv'd to check all <HI>distrustful Fears,</HI> and encourage the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> of a favourable Answer to our Prayers, and happy Result of our se∣rious Consultations and Endeavours.</P>
<P>A firm belief and due thought of CHRIST's Domi∣nion, as Head of the Church, will tend to lay a Restraint upon our impatient Fears, in a Day of Clouds and Darkness; to enliven and invi∣gorate our Hopes, in Cases of Difficulty, and in times of doubtful Expectation. If CHRIST sits at the Helm; if He be the supreme Moderator of all Events; we are sure then, Nothing shall come to pass but by his Permission, and with the Security of his own Inte∣rest and Glory. There are many Devices in the heart of Man: but the Counsel of the Lord, that shall stand. He sits upon the Floods, and rules the Waves of the Sea, and stilleth the Tumult of the People. He scattereth the Proud in the Imagination of their Hearts; but his Thoughts are very deep, and his Designs cannot be defeated. He is Head over all things to the Church: And if He love the Church, which is his Body, we may trust He will protect and keep it; will nourish and cherish, and make all
<PB N="51" REF="002871_0053_0FE67EFEE8441718"/>
needful provision for it. We may be sure that all things shall be overrul'd for the promoting of <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI>'s Peace and Welfair. Hence then in the pre∣sent Case, we shou'd establish our Thoughts, and confirm our Faith and Hope, by meditating on CHRIST's Power and Dominion. A realising View of this will help our Unbelief, strengthen our Hearts to wait upon the LORD; who is a GOD of Judgment, and blessed are all they that wait for him. Be patient therefore, Brethren, unto the appearing of the Lord: Behold, the Husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the Earth, and hath long Patience for it. Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: Be not faithless but believing. <HI>Believe in the LORD your GOD, so shall ye prosper.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. It will be of happy use, to promote in us a due <HI>Resignedness</HI> and <HI>Submission</HI> to his holy Will and Dispose.</P>
<P>Knowing that when the Lot is cast into Lap, <HI>the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord</HI>; This will teach us a willing Subjection to his Counsel and Pleasure. The Disciples having pray'd, as in our Text, pro∣ceeded to cast the Lot; and it falling on <HI>Matthias,</HI> 'tis observ'd, <HI>He was numbred with the Eleven Apostles</HI>; doubtless with great Peace and Harmony. And so much seems intimated in this Remark of the Histo∣rian; the original word for <HI>numbered,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Calculis allectus. <HI>Beza.</HI></NOTE> importing (as hinted before) his being counted among them by the <HI>united</HI> approbatory Suffrages of all concern'd. <HI>Barsabas</HI> and his Friends doubtless readily yielded to the Choice, and all unanimously receiv'd <HI>Matthias</HI> (though not the first in Nomination) as the Man whom CHRIST had chosen and prefer'd. We hear of no Murmurings or Exceptions.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="002871_0054_0FE67EFF0ED65318"/>Now a serious Consideration of CHRIST as LORD, will tend to assist us unto the like excellent frame and carriage, in the Affair before us.</P>
<P>Antecedent to the solemn Transaction, there shou'd be a humble referring the Conclusion to a Divine Dis∣pose; in that primitive Language, <HI>Acts</HI> 21.14. <HI>The Will of the LORD be done!</HI> The Consideration of CHRIST as LORD will promote this happy Resignation of Soul; and will help to save us from that ungodly Peremptoriness and Presumption in our Designs and Resolves, and that vain boasting in Creatures, which it should be our Care to avoid. According to that of the Apostle, <HI>James</HI> 4.15, 16. <HI>For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, We shall — do this or that. But now ye rejoyce in your Boastings: all such rejoycing is evil.</HI> — 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.21, 22. <HI>Let no man glory in Men: for all things are yours, whether</HI> Paul, <HI>or</HI> Apollo, <HI>or</HI> Cephas.</P>
<P>And so, when the Work is brought to a fair and orderly Issue, it is then our Duty to acquiesce in the Choice, and be satisfy'd wherever the Lot falls. <HI>Nei∣ther let us tempt CHRIST, nor murmur ye.</HI> Our Lan∣guage must be like that, of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> 2 Kin. 20.19. <HI>Good is the Word of the Lord. Is it not good, if Peace and Truth be in my days?</HI></P>
<P>Sutable Views of CHRIST's Dominion will tend to produce in us a Patient Submission to <HI>his Providence,</HI> if cross'd in our Desires, and disappointed of our Hopes: will make us willing to part with our dearest Enjoyments; to give up our fondest Expectations, at his bidding, and not pursue our Designs against the manifest Checks of Providence, as if we meant to step into the Throne of CHRIST, and correct the Measures of the most High.</P>
<P>It will dispose us to a chearful Reception and Christian Treatment of Him, as <HI>our Brother and Mi∣nister of GOD,</HI> whom we behold approved in CHRIST;
<PB N="53" REF="002871_0055_0FE67F063153F1E8"/>
chosen in the LORD. Hence we read, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.9. <HI>When</HI> James, Cephas <HI>and</HI> John <HI>who seemed to be pillars, perceived the Grace that was given unto</HI> Paul, <HI>they gave to him the right hands of Fellowship.</HI> And hence that Exhortation to the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.10, 11. <HI>Now if Timothy come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do. Let no man therefore despise him.</HI></P>
<P>And then it will by natural Consequence make us patient towards our Neighbours and Brethren, will restrain us from passionate Resentments and dividing Measures, under a Frustration of our Hopes, and ex∣cite us to do all things without Murmurings, Disputings or unreasonable Oppositions. Hence the Apostle makes use of the Name of the LORD JESUS, in per∣suading the Church at <HI>Corinth</HI> unto Peace and Union, when carnally contending, and divided into Parties, one saying, I am of <HI>Paul,</HI> and another I am of <HI>Apol∣lo</HI>: As in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.10. <HI>Now I beseech you, Brethren,</HI> BY THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST, <HI>that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no Divisions among you: but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same Mind and in the same Judgment.</HI> The Name of the LORD JESUS carries a sacred Charm with it, that tends to still all Contention, Clamour, and Dis∣pute among his Disciples (particularly in the present Case) and excite the greatest Care of Peace, Chari∣ty, and Unity, as that which makes very much for the Honour of CHRIST, and the Interest of his King∣dom. Hence those pathetical Expostulations &amp; Coun∣sels of the Apostle, in <HI>Rom</HI> 14. <HI>Who art thou that judgest another Man's Servant? Or why dost thou set at nought thy Brother? — For he that in these things serveth CHRIST, is acceptable to GOD, and approved of Men. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for Peace, and things where with one may edify another.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="002871_0056_0FE67F06556CBDC0"/>But I pass now to say,</P>
<P N="2">II. The Consideration of CHRIST, as <HI>knowing the Hearts of all Men,</HI> is another very useful Reflection, and may be of great Service in the present Affair.</P>
<P>This gives a very awful, and yet an equally joyful Idea of our Lord; and what He wou'd have solemnly consider'd by his People. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.23. <HI>All the Churches shall know, that I am He which searcheth the Reins and Hearts.</HI> How else indeed shou'd He judge the Se∣crets of Men, and give to every one according to his Works; as He certainly will do! The Eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the Evil and the Good<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pro. 15.2, 11.</NOTE>. Hell and Destruction are before the Lord: how much more then the Hearts of the Chil∣dren of Men? Verily to his piercing Eye every Bosom is transparent, and all things there appear in the most open Light to Him, which are beyond the Reach of all human Discovery. And this Thought is capable of an application to very good Purposes, both by way of Direction and Incentive; as in the common Con∣cerns of the Christian Life, so particularly in the extraordinary Affair before us.</P>
<P>To illustrate this, let me suggest a few particulars.</P>
<P>For Instance,</P>
<P N="1">I. The Consideration of CHRIST's knowing the Hearts of all Men, as in our Text apply'd to the present Affair, may be useful to <HI>direct</HI> us in our Choice, what to <HI>aim at,</HI> and what regards to be influenced by.</P>
<P>It was a Reproof the Apostle gave to some in the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> who indulg'd such a spirit of E∣mulation about their Teachers (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.7.) <HI>Do ye look on things after the outward appearance?</HI> This is a common Rule of judging: but a false Rule, at least a very imperfect and insufficient One. It shou'd
<PB N="55" REF="002871_0057_0FE67F09C5E2C278"/>
seem, that some boasted mighty things of themselves, and affected to make a fair Shew in the flesh, but they boasted of things without measure, and by fair Speeches deceived the Hearts of the Simple. We often suffer our Views only to glide upon the Super∣ficies of Men and Things, and take no pains to enter into their Realities and true Characters. We are either easily impos'd upon by deceiving Appearances, and draw up a hasty Judgment. Or else we are led away with Mistakes about the Nature of Things, and consider not where true Excellency lies. Agreeably, things of comparatively less Significancy, often have the preference with us: the things of the Body, to the things of the Soul: So again the things of the Mind, to the things of the Heart; intellectual Ac∣complishments, to spiritual Graces and moral Virtues: Which is the most perverse Judgment in the World. And to act under the Influence of such a false View of things in the Affair before us, must needs be of dangerous Tendency.</P>
<P>But here our <HI>Text</HI> may set us right; which intimates that the Disciples looked chiefly at the <HI>Heart,</HI> in the Choice before them; and that CHRIST looketh at the Hearts of Men, in chusing Pastors for his Church. We are apt to look chiefly at the Head, and external Appear∣ance, an happy Utterance, bright Gifts, the Powers of Reason, the Beauties of Language, or the like: but verily the Lord looketh at the Heart. The Lord weigheth the Spirits; and he estimates us by our inner Man. To be renew'd in the spirit of our Minds, after the Image of Him that created us in Righteousness and true Holiness, this is our high∣est Glory; and is the most exalted Character of a Minister of the Gospel: Whose Adorning, let it not be that outward Adorning of Eloquence, Beauty, or worldly Pomp: but let it be the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Or∣nament
<PB N="56" REF="002871_0058_0FE67F09E7BEDDA0"/>
of Humility and Sanctity, which is of great price in the sight of GOD. The Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour. In a Minister, it's the Christian, we are to look at, more than the Scholar, or the Oratour. He shou'd indeed be apt to teach; able also to convince Gainsayers. And a People shou'd Covet earnestly the best Gifts: Yet shew I unto you <HI>a more excellent way: Seek a Proof of CHRIST speak∣ing in him,</HI> and being with him. For though one speak with the Tongues of Men and Angels, and have not Charity (a Principle of Divine Love reigning in his Soul, the Love of CHRIST constraining him) he is as a sounding Brass, or a tinkling Cymbal: And tho' he have the Gift of Prophecy, and understand all Mysteries, and be fill'd with all Knowledge; yet if he have not a true Love to CHRIST, and Love to Souls, prevailing in him, verily <HI>he is Nothing</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 12.31. &amp; 13.1, 2.</NOTE>. That's a Divine Rule, for proportioning our Esteem of others, as well as of our selves; <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.3. <HI>To think so∣berly, according as GOD hath dealt to every man the measure of FAITH</HI>; in judging of which, a rational Charity must be our Guide and set the Limits.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Consideration of CHRIST as <HI>knowing the Hearts of all Men</HI> may serve further <HI>to animate and encourage the Hope and Faith</HI> of his People in the pre∣sent Case.</P>
<P>It may serve to encourage Prayer on this occasion, and the Hope of a gracious Answer. <HI>Moses</HI> seems to have had it in View▪ when he pray'd, as in <HI>Numb.</HI> 27.16. <HI>Let the Lord, the GOD of the Spirits of all Flesh set a Man over the Congregation.</HI>—He formeth the Spirit of Man within him, and he pondereth the Spi∣rits of Men. He knows every one's particular Tem∣per, Capacity, and real Character, with unerring
<PB N="57" REF="002871_0059_0FE67F118A847588"/>
exactness. He knows the Hearts of <HI>all Men</HI>; the Hearts of Ministers and People; of Candidates and Electors. —CHRIST knows the Wants of his People, and knows their Hearts Desire and Prayer; and as our Advocate with the Father, represents the same unto Him; which may assure us of obtaining our Requests, if agreeable to his Will. See <HI>Mat.</HI> 18.19, 20. So 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 5.14, 15.</P>
<P>He knows what is <HI>the Mind of the Spirit</HI>: whom the holy Ghost will make Overseers of the Flock; and so how to order his Mediatorial Intercession, in the present Case, <HI>according to the Will of GOD.</HI> (Rom. 8.27.)</P>
<P>He that searcheth the Hearts, knoweth who are the fittest to be chosen; who will be the most holy, humble, skilful, faithful, active Instruments of his Glory. <HI>Solomon</HI> observes, <HI>The fining pot is for Silver, and the furnace for Gold: but the Lord trieth the Hearts</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Pro. 17.3.</NOTE>. He has a clear prospect into the secret Recesses of the Soul, and knoweth whose Heart is upright toward him, and who is most formed for his Praise. As to Men, they themselves scarce <HI>know what spirit they are of.</HI> Hence <HI>not he that commendeth him∣self, is approved; but whom the Lord commendeth</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 10.18.</NOTE>. And as for popular Applause, this is often founded in false Notion of Worth, or ignorance of Men's true Characters. Hence that of our LORD to the <HI>Pharisees</HI> in his day, who were so much had in ho∣nour among the People; (<HI>Luk.</HI> 16.15.) <HI>He said unto them, Ye are they which justify your selves before Men; but GOD knoweth your Hearts: for that which is high∣ly esteemed amongst Men, is Abomination in the sight of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>I may allude to the Story <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 16.</NOTE> of <HI>Samuel</HI>'s viewing the Sons of <HI>Jesse</HI> (among whom GOD had provided

him a King to reign over <HI>Israel</HI>) and observe, We are ready to say of this and the other, <HI>Surely the Lord's Anointed is before him</HI>: But <HI>the Lord seeth not as Man seeth.</HI> We look upon <HI>Eliab,</HI> and are flush'd with Hopes, he is the Man; <HI>but the Lord saith, Look not on his Countenance, or on the Height of his Stature; for I have refused him.</HI> And when we look upon <HI>Abinadab,</HI> neither <HI>hath the Lord chosen him.</HI> And when <HI>Shammah</HI> is made to pass before us, <HI>Behold, neither hath the Lord chosen this.</HI> Yea, tho' we turn our Eyes to seven others, it yet appears <HI>The Lord has not chosen these.</HI> And when we are ready to inquire, with <HI>Samuel, — Are here all?</HI> It happens there remains still one, the most unthought of: and the Lord saith, <HI>Arise, anoint him; This is he.</HI> For Man looketh on the outward Appearance; but <HI>the Lord looketh on the Heart</HI>: And when He bestows in Mercy, and not in Wrath, He gives a <HI>David,</HI> a Man after His own Heart. — Indeed he was pleas'd to appoint a treacherous <HI>Judas</HI> to be one of his first Apostles: and He often permits a worldly <HI>Demas</HI> to be put into the Ministry. But then He has some wise and holy Designs of his Kingdom to serve by it: and it's sometimes done in Judgment to a People, that have provoked him to Anger. But when he has Intentions of Favour to a People, in whom he delighteth, he gives them a faithful Minis∣try. See 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.12. <HI>And I thank CHRIST JESUS our LORD, who hath enabled me; for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>His Knowledge of the Hearts of Men qualifies him to judge infallibly of Men, and to make a most wise and just Choice. <HI>The righteous Lord trieth the Hearts and Reins.</HI> (<HI>Psal.</HI> 7.9.) Since He knows the Hearts of all Men, He cannot be deceived: but is able to make the most righteous Judgment, and give a perfect Lot. His Eyes are upon the righteous; He

beholdeth every <HI>Peter,</HI> that can appeal to Him, say∣ing, <HI>Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love Thee</HI>: And unto such an one He saith, <HI>Feed my Sheep</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. 21.17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His Knowledge of the Hearts of Men argues his Ability to prepare and dispose Men's Hearts aright: And if he does not find them at present fit for his purpose (as in the Case of <HI>Saul,</HI> who from a Blasphemer and Persecutor, was chang'd into a Preacher and Apostle of JESUS CHRIST) he has power to <HI>enable them</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. 1.12.</NOTE>, to furnish and spirit them to their Work. He can give <HI>them another Heart,</HI> as in the case of the for∣mer <HI>Saul,</HI> the famous Son of <HI>Kish</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. 10.6, 9.</NOTE>. Behold, a Com∣pany of Prophets met him, after he was anointed by <HI>Samuel,</HI> and the Spirit of GOD came upon him, and he prophesy'd among them, and <HI>was turned into ano∣ther Man.</HI> And it became a Proverb in Israel, <HI>Is Saul also among the Prophets!</HI> — So true are those Obser∣vations of the Wise Man, <HI>The King's heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of Water, He turneth it whithersoever He will</HI><NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Pro. 20.1.</NOTE>. — <HI>The Preparations of the heart in Man, and the answer of the Tongue, are from the Lord</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Ch. 16.1.</NOTE>. He has all Hearts in his Hand, as well as under his Eye. He fashioneth Men's Hearts, and worketh in them to will and to do of his good plea∣sure. Unto every one of us is given Grace <HI>accord∣ing to the measure of the Gift of CHRIST.</HI> He can easi∣ly inspire a Man with Divine Principles, and heaven∣ly Tempers: can fill him with Knowledge and <HI>put Wisdom in his Heart,</HI> that he may go out and come in before his People. The LORD is able to make all Grace abound towards him; to give him largeness of Heart, and Wisdom exceeding much. — Hence then, supposing in the case before us, the Lot should fall upon a Person, whom some may apprehend less

accomplish'd, and less worthy: yet consider that the Lord knoweth and influenceth the Hearts of all Men, and can prepare his Heart to the Work he is call'd unto, and let this suppress every anxious Passion or unbelieving Thought; still our Complaints, and open our Hearts to lay out Faith and Prayer for him.</P>
<P>In a word, Consider, He who searcheth the Reins, can govern <HI>your</HI> Hearts, as he pleaseth, and can unite you in your Judgments and Inclinations, <HI>The hand of GOD may be to give you one Heart.</HI> So that you shall be perfectly joined together in the same Mind, and with one Mouth glorify GOD, in the unanimous Choice of some meet and worthy Person. Or if he shou'd permit you to be somewhat divided in your Apprehensions, He can prevent the Disagreement from passing over to the Affections, and still keep your Hearts knit together in Love. Or if any (which GOD prevent) shou'd be irregularly dispos'd after the Matter is reduc'd to a fair Issue, He that sitteth in the Heavens, and that knows the Thoughts of the Wise, can restrain and over-rule, to his own Glory.</P>
<P>All which Reflections tend to strengthen Faith and Hope. Wherefore let not your Heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Trust in the Lord at all times, O ye People, pour out your Desires before Him; and in the way of Duty leave the Affair and all Events with Him. In cases of Difficulty, which depend very much upon the Hearts of Men, as well as in all others, we shou'd chearfully refer the Ad∣ministration and Success of our Concernments unto Him, <HI>in whose hand the Righteous, and the Wise, and their Works are, and whose are all our Ways</HI>; not anx∣iously perplex our selves, about the Events of un∣certain Futurity, but perswading our selves that the Lord will do better for us than our own Counsel and Choice, be resign'd to his good Pleasure. <Q>And when He by his Providence declares his Will (as
<PB N="61" REF="002871_0063_0FE67F17A7D72090"/>
one <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Tillotson.</HI> Vol. II. page 636.</NOTE> observes) look upon it as the Sentence of a wise and just Judge, in which all Parties concern'd ought to acquiesce and rest fully satisfy'd. We cannot but be convinced, that this is very reasona∣ble, to leave the management of things to Him, <HI>whose Understanding is infinite,</HI> and therefore knows best how to order them. The Government of the World is a very curious and complicated thing, and not to be tamper'd with by every unskilful hand: and therefore as an unskilful Man, after he has tamper'd a great while with a <HI>Watch,</HI> thinking to bring it into better Order, and is at last convinced that he can do no good upon it, carries it to him that made it, to mend and put it in Order; so must we do, after all our Care and Anxiety about our own private Concernments, or the publick State of Things: we must give over governing the World, as a Business past our Skill, as a Province too hard, and a <HI>Knowledge too won∣derful for us,</HI> and leave it to him who made the World, to govern it and take Care of it. And if we be not thus affected and disposed, we do not believe the Providence of GOD, whatever Profes∣sion we make of it; or are not firmly persuaded of the Wisdom and Goodness of it.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. The Consideration of CHRIST, as knowing the Hearts of all Men, will have a further Influence, to promote a Care of <HI>Integrity,</HI> in the whole Conduct of the Affair before us; and to <HI>comfort</HI> us by a Sense of our Sincerity, both under the Crosses of Provi∣dence, and the Calumnies of Men.</P>
<P>This Reflection duly entertained, will be a <HI>Motive</HI> and <HI>Help</HI> to Sincerity: will tend to rectify our Aims; to make us keep our Hearts with all Diligence, and study to shew our selves approved unto Him, who
<PB N="62" REF="002871_0064_0FE67F17D1F0B660"/>
trieth the Reins. That is Christian's Motto, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.4. <HI>Not as pleasing Men, but GOD which trieth our Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>It will be a good Preservative and Guard against the Rashness and Folly, which is too often committed in this Affair, when the LORD JESUS CHRIST is left out of our Schemes, or we leave to him only the Ex∣ecution of our Decrees, and mock him by commend∣ing to his Benediction, what we have projected with∣out his Counsel.</P>
<P>It will promote Sincerity in our <HI>Desires</HI> and <HI>Prayers,</HI> that CHRIST wou'd shew us whom He hath chosen: and therefore will make us beware that no Idol of Jealousy have harbour in our Bosoms; which will provoke the Lord to pass that Doom upon us, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14. <HI>These Men have set up their Idols in their Heart;—should I at all be inquired of by them?</HI> — Surely <HI>I the LORD will answer them by my self, and will set my Face against them.</HI> — The Scripture has put those solemn Words of prayer into our Mouths, 1 Kin. 8.39. <HI>Then hear thou in Heaven thy Dwelling place, and give to every one according to his Ways, whose Heart Thou knowest.</HI> But how shall we dare to pray in such awful Language, without a most sollicitous Care to avoid Hypocrisy; and to seek the Lord with our whole Desire, lifting up holy Hands, and drawing nigh to Him with a true Heart: Whose penetrating Eye has an immediate Access to the Mind, and a distict Prospect of all the se∣cret Motions in every Breast, through all possible Masks and Disguises!</P>
<P>Moreover, If we are under the power of this ap∣prehension, that his Eye is upon us, by whom Actions are weigh'd, and who understandeth our Thoughts afar off; it will excite a Care of Uprightness in our <HI>Choice</HI> and whole Management. That is propos'd as a Motive to Sincerity and Care to please the Lord: <HI>Prov.</HI> 21.2. <HI>Every way of a Man is right in his own Eyes: but the Lord pondereth the Hearts.</HI> Hence
<PB N="63" REF="002871_0065_0FE67F1A5626DA48"/>
<HI>David</HI> strongly recommends it to his Son 1 <HI>Chro.</HI> 28.9. <HI>Serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind; for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts.</HI> This Reflection had an excellent Influence on holy <HI>David</HI> himself, 1 Chro. 29.17. <HI>I know, my GOD, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in Uprightness. As for me</HI> (therefore) <HI>in the Uprightness of my heart I have willingly offer'd all these things.</HI> The Sense of this will be a powerful Excitement to do what we do, <HI>heartily, as to the Lord, and not to Men</HI>; to act with an upright View to his Glory, as our ultimate Aim, and to propose no other Ends but what as subordinate to this, He will ap∣prove of. The Sense of his Heart-searching Eye upon us will make us abhor vain Thoughts and wic∣ked Purposes, as an Abomination to the Lord; and put us upon purifying our Aims from all base alloy of Prejudice, Interest, or any other impure tincture. It will antidote and fortify us against all manner of Temptations to Evil, by the Principles of Shame and Fear. The People of GOD found it a happy Re∣straint to them: <HI>Psal.</HI> 44.18 — 21. <HI>Our Heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way. — If we have forgotten the Name of our GOD; shall not GOD search this out? For He knoweth the Se∣crets of the Heart.</HI> — This is improveable as a strong Caution against all criminal Partiality. Hence the Apostle exhorting <HI>Timothy</HI> to be impartial and up∣right in his Conduct, addresses him after that solemn Manner, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.21, 22. <HI>I charge thee before GOD, and the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and the elect Angels, that thou observe these things, without preferring one be∣fore another</HI> [or without <HI>Prejudice,</HI> as the Original properly signifies, and the vulgar <HI>Latin</HI> translates it] <HI>doing nothing by partiality: Lay hands suddenly on no Man, neither be partakers of othea Men's Sins.</HI></P>
<P>Thus a Sense of the Eye of CHRIST upon us tends to
<PB N="64" REF="002871_0066_0FE67F1A78A18348"/>
make us beware of Partiality and Hypocrisy: and that Consideration receives additional force from the prospect of a future <HI>Judgment.</HI> For this Knowlege and critical Observation of Men's Hearts and Ways, is in order to a day of reckoning. <HI>(Jer.</HI> 17.10. and <HI>Prov.</HI> 24.12.) And the serious Consideration of our being all to appear before the Judgment Seat of CHRIST, tends to make us <HI>labour, that we may be accepted of Him.</HI> Such Influence it had on the Apostle, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.9, 10. Hence our LORD said to his Disciples, <HI>Luk.</HI> 12.1, 2. <HI>Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is Hypocrisy. For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known.</HI> A due Sense of our Accountableness to the LORD JE∣SUS CHRIST will awe and restrain us from Sin, and excite us unto Duty: will make us ponder our Ways, and look well to our Goings, that we may be in Be∣haviour as becometh Holiness; doing nothing in any Affair, but what will bear the Light; and so may have this for our Rejoycing, the testimony of our Conscience —. Then shall we have Confidence to∣ward GOD: Whereas if our Heart condemn us, the Lord is greater than our Heart and knoweth all things. He will bring every Work into Judgment, with every secret thing. Then the Thoughts of Men's Hearts shall be reveal'd: Whatsoever ye have spo∣ken in Darkness, shall be heard in the Light; and that which you have spoken in the Ear in Closets, shall be proclaimed upon the House-tops. The good Works of some are manifest before-hand, and they that are otherwise, cannot be hid. And hence the Conscience of Integrity will give us a prospect of our having boldness in the Day of Judgment, and Confidence before the Son of Man at his appearing.</P>
<P>A Sense of Sincerity will give us a holy boldness now, and Access with Confidence unto the Lord in Prayer: will embolden us to wrestle with Him for the
<PB N="65" REF="002871_0067_0FE67F20B8C52460"/>
Blessing, unto whom we may with the utmost Security commit every good Cause. <HI>Prov.</HI> 16.2, 3. <HI>The Lord weigheth the Spirits: Commit thy Works to the Lord, and thy Thoughts shall be established.</HI></P>
<P>And it will minister to our Consolation under any Disappointment we may meet with, if we can appeal to the Searcher of Hearts, as witness to our Sincerity. <HI>Psal.</HI> 142.2. <HI>When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my Path.</HI> Yea, if the Lot of any be involuntarily cast under an unfaithful Ministry, and they have born due Testimony against the same, it may be consolatory to them to think that CHRIST <HI>knows their Works and their Patience, and how they can∣not bear them which are evil, and have tried them which say they are Apostles and are not.</HI> (See <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.2.)</P>
<P>So under invidious Characters, hard Speeches and Reproaches of Men, who may tax us with Partiality, carnal Policy, secret Intreagues and fraudulent Prac∣tices, or with sinister Respects, and unjust Prejudices, or the like; here a View to the future Account, and the Thought of CHRIST's all-seeing Eye, may sup∣port and comfort us, if we are really conscious to our Integrity and Innocence. We may appeal to Hea∣ven, and say as the Prophet (<HI>Jer.</HI> 20.12.) <HI>O Lord of Hosts, that triest the Righteous, and seest the Reins and Heart, — unto Thee have I opened my Cause.</HI> We may humbly hope that <HI>GOD which knoweth the Hearts, will bear us Witness.</HI> (<HI>Acts</HI> 15.8.) And may learn to despise the uncharitable Censures of Men, when they speak Evil of the things which they know not. Hence that of the Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. — <HI>It is required in Stewards, that a Man be found faithful. But with me it is a</HI> VERY SMALL <HI>thing that I should be judged of you, or of Man's Judgment. But he that judgeth is the Lord. Therefore judge nothing before the Time, until the Lord come, who will bring to Light the hidden things of Darkness, and will make manifest
<PB N="66" REF="002871_0068_0FE67F20DBBE62F0"/>
the Counsels of the Heart: And then shall every man have Praise of GOD</HI>; every Man who has walked in his Uprightness.</P>
<P>In a word, The thought of CHRIST's Inspection of us, and our Accountableness to Him, will tend to prevent all unchristian Heats and Animosities; to allay and hush Men's Passions, so apt to be unquiet and impetuous, when cross'd in their particular Views. It will teach us all to watch against uncharitable Thoughts, and <HI>evil Surmisings,</HI> contrary to the Love which shou'd be among Brethren: and will teach us to take heed to our Ways, that we offend not with our Tongues: will teach us to forbear all Clamour, and Wrath, and Evil-speaking, Impatience, unreaso∣nable Humour, and Self-willedness: And on the contrary will teach us to deny our selves, to be kind∣ly affectioned one to another with brotherly Love, in honour preferring one another, being swift to hear, slow to speak: Not to mind high things, but to con∣descend unto Men of low Estate, and every one please his Neighbour for his Good, to Edification: To be of a yielding Temper, <HI>studying</HI> to be quiet; and <HI>if it be possible,</HI> as much as lieth in us, endea∣vouring to live peaceably. To this End is that Ex∣hortation, <HI>Col.</HI> 4.6. <HI>Let your Speech be alway with grace, seasoned with Salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every Man.</HI> And hence those Intreaties, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.1, 2, 5. <HI>Therefore my Brethren, dearly beloved, and longed for, my Joy and Crown, so stand fast my dearly beloved. I beseech</HI> Euodias, <HI>and beseech</HI> Syntiche, <HI>that they be of the same Mind in the LORD. — Let your Moderation be known to all Men.</HI> THE LORD IS AT HAND. And agreeable are those Counsels of the Apostle <HI>James</HI>: My Brethren have not the Faith of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, the LORD of Glory, with Respect of Persons. — So speak ye, and so do, <HI>as they that shall be judged</HI> by the Law of Liberty. — My Brethren <HI>be
<PB N="67" REF="002871_0069_0FE67F23A931C2D8"/>
not many Masters</HI>; knowing that ye shall receive the greater Condemnation. — Do ye think that the Scrip∣ture saith in vain. <HI>The Spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to Envy?</HI> But submit your selves to GOD: Resist the Devil; and grudge not one against another, Bre∣thren, lest ye be condemned: <HI>Behold, the Judge stand∣eth before the Door.</HI></P>
<P>I conclude with those Apostical Benedictions and Apologies, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 15.</P>
<P>Now the GOD of Patience and Consolation grant that you be <HI>like-minded</HI> one towards another, accord∣ing to CHRIST JESUS. That ye may with <HI>one Mind</HI> and <HI>one Mouth</HI> glorify GOD. — The GOD of Hope fill you with all Joy and Peace in believing, that ye may abound in Hope through the power of the HOLY GHOST. And I my self am persuaded of you, my Bre∣thren, that ye are full of Goodness, filled with all Knowledge, able also to admonish one another. Ne∣vertheless, Brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you, in some sort, as putting you in Mind; be∣cause of the Grace that is given me of GOD, that I should be the Minister of JESUS CHRIST <HI>unto you.</HI> Now therefore I beseech you, Brethren, for the LORD JESUS CHRIST's sake, &amp; for the Love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in Prayers to GOD for me, that I may with you be refreshed. And now the GOD of Peace be with you all. Amen.</P>
