<P>AN ATTEMPT To nip in the Bud, the unscriptural Doctrine of UNIVERSAL SALVATION, and some other dan∣gerous Errors connected with it; which a cer∣tain STRANGER, who calls himself JOHN MUR∣RAY, has, of late, been endeavoring to spread in the First Parish of GLOUCESTER, to draw away Disciples after him.</P>
<P>IN A LETTER Addressed to one of those that are drawn away; if possible to reclaim him and the others. To this End and in Hopes that it may by the Bles∣sing of GOD serve also to confirm all in some of the most important Doctrines of GOD's Word, it is made public, in Answer to the Desire of a very respectable Number of Persons of Reputation and Influence in said Parish.</P>
<P>TO WHICH IS SUBJOINED, The DYING TESTIMONY for the Truth, and against Error, of their worthy Minister, the Reve∣rend Mr. SAMUEL CHANDLER, lately deceased.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now about a year since the following Letter was sent to the late <HI>Essex</HI> Printers—hostilities commencing soon after, by the <HI>British</HI> troops against the <HI>Americans,</HI> opened such a scene of business, &amp;c. as hitherto to prevent it's publication.</P>
<P>The Author, though he looks upon the followers of the <HI>Stranger,</HI> herein referred to, to be under a sad and sorrowful delusion, yet has a benevolent affection to them, and his daily prayer to God for them is, that they may be undeceived in time and made wise, un∣to eternal salvation; and earnestly prays them to read the following Letter with unprejudiced attention and an honest desire to know the Truth: "It is no more their interest than the Author's to be de∣ceived." Nay, if the doctrine of universal salvation, or of the final happiness of all men is true, we run no hazard in denying it to be true; we shall as cer∣tainly be saved and finally happy, as those will who avouch it, and enter heaven at death without going through purgatory or their <HI>intermediate state,</HI> pro∣vided we are <HI>washed and sanctified and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of God,</HI> be∣fore we die; which the advocates for universal sal∣vation must allow we may—without believing their doctrine of universal salvation to be true; otherwise deny there are, or ever were any true Christians— any born of God in this life, but those that believe
<PB N="iv" REF="014684_0003_0F948D2AC1AC6010"/>
<HI>that doctrine</HI>; which will not only deny all the Pro∣testant Churches of the present and past genera∣tions, but also all the Christian Martyrs, &amp;c. to be true Christians, sanctified in Christ, and called to be saints.—But what if this doctrine is not true? What if you have been given up to a strong delusion to believe a lie? Where will the sin∣ner—Where will the unbeliever, the impenitent, the profane, the ungodly apppear? Will it be your in∣terest in this case to be deceived? If your doctrine of the final happiness of all mankind is true, the Bible is not true! Let common sense speak, yea let Deists and Infidels say, whether they do not with one consent acknowledge that the Bible teaches in an open and express manner, that the unbeliever, the ungodly and impenitent, dying such, shall be pu∣nished with an everlasting destruction? Pray consider death is coming on us all, and the deceived will then be undeceived:—But what comfort will it be to find ourselves in hell with <HI>a lye in out right hand</HI> and <HI>a great gulf fixed?</HI>—O my dear fellow-probationers, let us consider our latter end—let us be wise for eter∣nity—let us repent and be converted while the long-suffering of God is waiting, and the door of salvation is open before us.—Let us fear God and keep his commandments, and be holy as God is holy in all manner of conversation and godliness, for without holiness no man shall see the Lord, but true holiness consists in real, hearty, practical conformity to our Lord's will in his word.</P>

<HEAD>AN ATTEMPT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>IPSWICH,
<DATE>March 1, 1775.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY a benevolent affection to you and others you now associate yourself with to attend the mi∣nistrations of the <HI>Stranger</HI> lately come into your Town, and from a serious concern for the cause of Christ and glory of God, I am moved to write a few things, which, I pray you and others concerned to take under proper consideration, viz.</P>
<P N="1">I. That all men are naturally in a sinful, con∣demned, and perishing state.—Sinful, <HI>for there is none that doth good, no not one—so then they that are in the flesh</HI> (as opposed to a being in the spirit) <HI>cannot please</HI> God.—<HI>Servants of sin—under the power of sa∣tan, who worketh in the hearts of the children of diso∣bedience.</HI>—Condemned and perishing, <HI>for he that be∣lieveth not, is condemned already—by the offence of one, judgment is come upon all men unto condemnation—under the curse—guilty before</HI> God, and the <HI>wrath of</HI> God <HI>abideth on them,</HI> which is <HI>revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. That it is absolutely necessary that we be born of the Spirit—have repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>— Born of the Spirit, <HI>for except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot see the kingdom of God; he cannot enter the kingdom of God</HI>; Christ says, <HI>Mar∣vel
<PB N="6" REF="014684_0005_0F948D2D75C20238"/>
not, that I said unto you, ye must be born again. The unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God</HI>; he must <HI>be washed and sanctified.—Without holiness no man shall see the Lord</HI> with comfort; hence we must <HI>be renewed in the spirit of our mind.</HI>—We must <HI>be cre∣ated after God in righteousness and true holiness.</HI>—None will receive Christ, or <HI>believe on his name,</HI> but such as <HI>are born of God.—The natural man discerneth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither</HI> CAN <HI>he know them, because they are spi∣ritually discerned.—No man</HI> CAN <HI>come to Christ, except the Father draw him.</HI>—None will or can love God or man with such a love as God requires in his com∣mands, without being born <HI>of God; he that loveth is born of God and knoweth God.</HI>—True saints are <HI>God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works.</HI>—Such as are passed from death unto life love the brethren—love them, <HI>not in word</HI> or <HI>in tongue, but in deed</HI> and <HI>in truth</HI>:—And <HI>this is love, that we keep God's commandments</HI> and <HI>Christ's sayings.</HI> They do their Lord's will. They do not live in the practice of what they know their Lord forbids, nor in the neglect of what they know he commands. We must have repentance toward God and faith to∣ward Christ our Lord and Saviour; for <HI>except sinners repent they must perish—they must repent and be con∣verted that their sins</HI> MAY <HI>be blotted out.—God now commands all men every where</HI> (where the gospel comes) <HI>to repent.</HI>—Such as are not moved to repentance by the <HI>goodness, long-suffering, and forbearance of God,</HI> are, <HI>after their hardness</HI> and <HI>the impenitency of their hearts, treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</HI>—Wo un∣to <HI>Chorazin</HI> and <HI>Bethsaida,</HI> that repented not! <HI>It shall
<PB N="7" REF="014684_0006_0F948D30EB393F20"/>
be more tolerable for</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrah <HI>in the day of judgment than for them</HI>;—they that repent not, are the children of their <HI>father the devil, and the lusts of their father they will do.</HI>—They are the <HI>enemies</HI> of God and Christ, they will not be reconciled to God, nor <HI>have Christ to reign over them.</HI>—Impenitent sin∣ners, dying such, must be damned; <HI>consider this,</HI> says God, <HI>ye that forget God,</HI> lest <HI>I tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver: It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, who has said, Vengeance is mine, I will repay it—and will by no means clear the guilty.—If the sinner turn not, God will whet his sword, he hath bent his bow and made it ready,</HI> and yet calls to sinners saying, <HI>Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die?</HI>— We must turn to God with <HI>weeping</HI> and <HI>mourning,</HI> with <HI>a broken heart</HI> and <HI>a contrite spirit, loathing our∣selves for all our abominations, and abhorring ourselves in dust and ashes before God,</HI> lying low, infinitely low, in the deepest humility at his feet.—But we must re∣pent and turn to God by faith in Christ, <HI>for no man can come to God but by Christ,</HI> or by faith in Christ; <HI>Christ is the</HI> only <HI>way to the Father</HI>; it is by faith <HI>we see the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.—If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost,</HI> (as all unbe∣livers are) <HI>in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glori∣ous gospel of Christ, who is the image of God should shine unto them.</HI></P>
<P>Faith toward our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is expressed by <HI>receiving</HI> Christ, the gift of God; <HI>com∣ing</HI> to Christ; <HI>eating</HI> his flesh and <HI>drinking</HI> his blood; <HI>believing in him with all the heart; coming after Christ; denying ourselves, selling all we have,</HI> or <HI>leaving all</HI> and <HI>following</HI> Christ; by <HI>being in Christ.—abiding</HI> in him
<PB N="8" REF="014684_0007_0F948D31F93B0BF8"/>
as the branch in the vine, <HI>rejoicing</HI> in Christ Jesus without any confidence in the flesh; <HI>counting</HI> all things as loss and dung, for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, to win Christ and be found in him.—<HI>Fleeing</HI> for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us.—All which variety of expression of faith in Christ necessarily implies, that in true faith, there is <HI>application</HI> to Christ, <HI>union</HI> to Christ and a <HI>change</HI> of our state.—We are <HI>in Christ,</HI> and no longer <HI>out of</HI> Christ, or <HI>with out</HI> Christ.—We are <HI>members of his bo∣dy, of his flesh, and of his bones.—Old things are done away with</HI> such. <HI>Behold all things are become new! There is no condemnation</HI> to such—<HI>they shall be saved:— They have peace with God:</HI>—They <HI>are justified, Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to</HI> them:—They are God's <HI>adopted children!</HI> They <HI>have power</HI> or right <HI>to become the Sons of God.</HI>—They <HI>have the Spirit of Christ,</HI> and <HI>are led by his Spirit.—Walk in</HI> it, <HI>walk after</HI> it, and <HI>live to Him that died for them—in newness of life—in righteousness and holiness.—Their delight is in the law of God after the inner man.</HI>—Their <HI>faith works by love</HI> to God, by love to saints, and by love of benevolence to the persons of wicked men and to personal ene∣mies, for they pray heartily for them.—These <HI>be∣live to the saving of their souls, are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation and shall receive the end of their faith the salvation of their souls,</HI> they <HI>shall be glorified.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. That all such as die out of Christ, neglecting so great salvation, cannot escape damnation in hell forever: It is Christ that says, <HI>He that beliveth not shall be damned.—Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.—Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will
<PB N="9" REF="014684_0008_0F948D32C2F412B0"/>
the Son of Man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of the Father with the holy angels.—Wo unto you that laugh now, for ye shall weep—shall be cast into outer darkness, where there</HI> is <HI>wailing and gnashing of teeth. Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</HI>—And in the day of judgment, Christ will say to the wicked, <HI>depart from me ye cursed into ever∣lasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels, where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.— The wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment.— There is a great gulf fixed between</HI> heaven and hell, or the spirits of just men made perfect in heaven and the damned in hell-torments, so that there will be no passing from heaven to hell, nor from hell to heaven.—<HI>But wide is the gate and broad is the way, which leadeth</HI> (from us on earth) <HI>to destruc∣tion</HI> in hell, <HI>and many there be that go in thereat; be∣cause strait is the gate and narrow is the way, which leads</HI> from us on earth, <HI>to life, in heaven, and few there be that find it.</HI>—And as to what the inspired Apostles say of this matter, time would fail me to relate—it is enough to observe, that such professors of religion as draw back, <HI>draw back to perdition</HI>;—that <HI>there re∣mains no more sacrifice for sin,</HI> for such as <HI>sin wilfully after they have received the knowledge of the truth,</HI> but <HI>a fearful looking for of judgment and firy indignation.</HI>— That <HI>it is impossible to renew</HI> such <HI>again unto repen∣tance,</HI> who <HI>fall away and crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh and put him to an open shame,</HI> after they have <HI>been once enlightened and tasted of the good word of God,</HI> &amp;c. That <HI>the heavens and the earth which are now,</HI> by the word of God are kept in store, <HI>reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of un∣godly men.</HI>—That Christ will be <HI>revealed from heaven
<PB N="10" REF="014684_0009_0F948D34D5E583B8"/>
in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God and obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ, whom he will punish with an everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and the glory of his power.—Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of,</HI> &amp;c.—<HI>We must all stand before the judg∣ment-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in the body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.—Unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness,</HI> the righ∣teous Judge <HI>will render</HI> in that day, <HI>indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish of soul.</HI> And the <HI>smoke of their torment will ascend up forever and ever.</HI> From the whole it appears as evident as inspired language can make it.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the time of life here on earth is our only probation-time for eternity. <HI>Behold now is the ac∣cepted time! Behold now is the day of salvation!</HI> God is now <HI>in Christ Jesus reconciling the world unto him∣self</HI>—he is now on <HI>a throne of grace, but after death</HI> is <HI>the judgment</HI>; after death, they that <HI>are fil∣thy will be filthy still</HI>; and they that are holy will be holy still.—When Christ cometh to judgment <HI>then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the Father—that God may be all in all.</HI>—And</P>
<P N="2">2. That after death unto the final judgment, while our bodies are in the grave our souls will be in a fixed state of happiness or misery, according to the state we were in when we gave up the ghost;— if in Christ, of happiness; if out of Christ—of misery, and after the resurrection and final judg∣ment the wicked will be in a state of punishment in soul and body forever and ever.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="014684_0010_0F948D34FB3B77A8"/>Now if <HI>all mankind will finally be saved and happy,</HI> Why did Christ and his inspired Penmen of holy scripture speak of the damnation and punishment of wicked men, dying in their impenitence and unbe∣lief, as being, after the day of judgment, fixed for an eternal duration? Or why do they, when speak∣ing of the misery and punishment of wicked men in hell, always make use of such terms and expressions, as are the most emphatical to impress our minds with an apprehension of their eternal, or <HI>endless</HI> and <HI>neverceasing duration</HI>; without the least hint, in other terms or expressions, that the damned shall finally be released from the punishments of hell, and be translated to the regions of eternal blessedness? What end could Christ and his inspired Writers have in view, in using such words in such a manner, upon this awful subject of the damnation of hell, as they knew all men of common sense must and would un∣derstand to import <HI>endless, neverceasing</HI> duration; if they knew at the same time the punishment of wicked men in hell will not be eternal, but have an end? Yea, What reason can be given why Christ did not tell his hearers, that no man would be fi∣nally lost, but every individual of mankind should finally be saved, especially when one of his hearers made it almost necessary, by putting this question to him. <HI>Are there few that be saved?</HI> Christ did not answer him saying, "You are under a gross error or mistake by means of the <HI>damning doctrine</HI> of your Teachers, who are proclaiming every where through the country, that wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be that go in thereat; because strait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth to life and few there be that find it."—No, No; but he said unto
<PB N="12" REF="014684_0011_0F948D35D5079350"/>
them, "Strive to enter in at the strait gate, for many I say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able, when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door, and you begin to stand without and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us, &amp;c."—Which answer plainly teaches, That none will be saved but such as enter the strait gate which opens into the narrow way that leads to life eternal.—That many of those that shall seek to enter therein shall not be able and hence shall not be saved, and that the reason why they shall not be able to enter the strait gate is, because they will not begin to seek, or to stand at the door and to knock until after the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door, until after their probation-time is at an end.</P>
<P>But if, notwithstanding what Christ and his in∣spired Penmen say to the contrary, the damned, after suffering in hell a certain finite or limited dura∣tion, shall be translated to heaven: Before we can receive this as an article of faith, we must be able to produce in the scriptures of truth, <HI>a thus saith the Lord for it</HI>; but where will you find the divine testimony in the book of God, that the wicked in hell will in some future period, either before, at or after the day of judgment, be delivered from the pains of hell and made blessed in heaven forever? And where is it said in the bible, that though Christ and the inspired Writers speak of hell-punishment as <HI>everlasting, eternal, forever and ever,</HI> &amp;c. Yet it must not be understood, that they taught, it would be <HI>properly everlasting, eternal, forever and ever,</HI> or to an endless durarion? Or where is it said in the word of God, that the words <HI>eternal, everlasting, forever,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The original word (in the Greek) is but one for all these in English.</NOTE>
<PB N="13" REF="014684_0012_0F948D3699B36438"/>
signify endless, neverceasing duration, when joined with <HI>life</HI> and <HI>blessedness</HI> in heaven; but <HI>never so</HI> when joined with <HI>destruction, punishment,</HI> or misery in hell?</P>
<P>Besides, if the wicked in hell shall ever, hereafter, come out of hell and be blessed in heaven, they must first pay the very last farthing or mite of the debt of ten thousand talents, for which they were cast into the prison of hell; for <HI>they shall not come out thence, until they have paid the very last farthing or mite,</HI> is the testimony of Christ; that is, they must suffer in hell as much and as long as they deserve to suffer at the hands of justice for the infinite evil of sin, as it is a violation of infinite obligation to love and obey God!</P>
<P>Now it is possible for a finite Being to suffer as much as he deserves to suffer for his sins, in a limited duration of time, or it is not: If it is possible, then we did not stand in absolute need of Christ, as an infinite Person to become our surety, and to make atonement for our sins by suffering for us, <HI>the just for the unjust,</HI> in order to deliver us from the wrath that is to come. For after persons have suffered as much as they deserve to suffer for their sins, they must be immediately delivered from a state of suffering; it will be no act of justice to hold them under punishment any longer: But such as are deli∣vered from hell on account of their own suffering, will not join with the redeemed in heaven in ascrib∣ing their redemption to Christ, as having redeemed them unto God by his blood:—But it is not possi∣ble for sinners in their own persons to suffer, in a li∣mited duration of time, all that they deserve to suffer for sin at the hands of justice, because sin is an in∣finite evil, which God infinitely hates, and therefore an infinite punishment in duration is what the sin∣ner deserves to suffer for it at the hands of divine justice.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="014684_0013_0F948D3736E69890"/>But supposing it possible to suffer in hell as much s we deserve for our sins, so as to be released from a state of punishment, this would not qualify the sin∣ner for the enjoyment of heaven; the inflicting pu∣nishment on men or devils in hell has no tendency to take away their enmity against God, and to make them his cordial friends; but this is absolutely ne∣cessary to our enjoying heaven, if we do not love God for his own sake, if we do not love him su∣premely, yea, if we do not love him in all his moral character as the heaven of heaven, heaven will be no heaven to us!</P>
<P>But we are sure from the most sure word of pro∣phesy, unto which we do well to take heed, <HI>that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God</HI>—and that such are all we, by nature as fallen creatures, and by practice sinners, and therefore, that none of us will inherit the kingdom of God, but such as are <HI>washed and sanctified and justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. That the holy scriptures abundantly call upon us <HI>to watch and pray</HI> that we enter not into tempta∣tion—<HI>to examine ourselves</HI> whether we be real christi∣ans—<HI>to watch our own hearts</HI>—to see that we <HI>receive the love of the truth,</HI> because such as do not receive it are in danger of being given up to <HI>strong delusions to believe a lie that they may be damned—to be vigilant and sober,</HI> because the devil, our adversary is going about seeking whom he may devour, as a roaring lion.—<HI>To beware of satan's ministers—wolves in sheep's clothing,</HI> who <HI>transform themselves</HI> into the ministers of Christ: We must <HI>not believe every spirit, but try the spirits</HI> whether they be of God, because there are many false prophets gone out into the world, who will <HI>privily</HI> bring in <HI>damnable heresies,</HI> by means of
<PB N="15" REF="014684_0014_0F948D37FA7F3458"/>
whose <HI>pernicious ways, the way of truth shall be evil spoken of</HI>; and because, by <HI>all deceivableness</HI> and by <HI>good words</HI> and <HI>fair speeches</HI> they will <HI>deceive the hearts of the simple,</HI> and use such <HI>cunning craftiness</HI> to corrupt the minds of people from the simplicity in Christ, that <HI>if it were possible,</HI> they would deceive the <HI>very elect, we must not go after them, but let them alone—for they are blind leaders of the blind</HI>—their words <HI>eat as doth a canker</HI>—their doctrine like <HI>leaven</HI> will spread and infect, or like a fascination or charm, captivate the reason and <HI>bewitch</HI> the senses or minds of people. "O foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, &amp;c.—Ye did run well, who hath hindered you? I bear you re∣cord, if it had been possible, you would have pluck∣ed out your own eyes and have given them to me. Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?"</P>
<P>Ah, ah, you will say, false Teachers and their doctrines are to be avoided: But who are these false Teachers? I will answer.</P>
<P N="1">1. False Teachers <HI>(wolves in sheep's clothing)</HI> are <HI>ungodly men; sensual not having the spirit of Christ</HI>; they may have the <HI>form of godliness,</HI> yet they always <HI>deny the power thereof.—They are of the world.</HI>—They have never been convinced, by the Holy Ghost, of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment.—Have ne∣ver been <HI>slain</HI> by the law; never through the law become <HI>dead to the law</HI>—that they might live to God.—Never had their mouths stopped and become sensibly guilty before God, as <HI>justly condemned.</HI>—Ne∣ver seen themselves <HI>cut off</HI> for their parts and brought to the feet of sovereign mercy with a <HI>God be merci∣ful to me a sinner.</HI>—Never brought to justify God, should judgment proceed against them in their ever∣lasting
<PB N="16" REF="014684_0015_0F948D38E79B1578"/>
punishment.—Never had the eyes of their understandings opened in the knowledge of Christ to see him in his true character, as the Son of God and Savior of men, as having all fulness in him, as being altogether lovely, so as to forsake all things, in affection for him, and to have every imagination and high thing which exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, cast down, and every thought brought into captivity unto the obedience of Christ. And to worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus without any confidence in the flesh:—Never been formed into such a temper of mind, as to delight in the moral law after the inner-man, as being just, holy, and good—to love God's glory for its own sake, as an ultimate good, and to live to the Lord, and glorify him in their body and in their spi∣rit which are his—to esteem God's precepts con∣cerning all things to be right, and to hate every false way—to repent and turn from every evil way, and to abhor themselves and repent in dust and ashes.— And to exercise a truly benevolent affection towards all men, friends and enemies.—It is true, they may have had awakenings and illuminations, and joys and comforts, and great confidence of their good estate before God, and great gifts of knowledge and utterance, speak with the tongue of men and angels, &amp;c. and yet have <HI>no charity,</HI> no love to God, no genuine benevolence to men, no friendly affection to Jesus Christ and his kingdom; but be <HI>wolves, dogs, concision,</HI> wholly wrapt up in a base, contracted, <HI>selfish</HI> spirit, inimical to God, Jesus Christ, and mankind.—And you may be sure, <HI>that Teacher</HI> is a wolf in sheep's cloathing, is destitute of true love to Christ, who lives in the neglect of <HI>family religion,</HI> and teaches others to do so, at least by

his practice, and makes light of Christ's ordinances, institutions, and sacramental seals of the covenant of grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. False teachers are <HI>hirelings, whose own the sheep are not,</HI> they do not <HI>naturally care</HI> for the good of the flock, the things which be Jesus Christ's.— They do not <HI>travel in birth</HI> of souls until Christ be formed in them; they do not <HI>wrestle in prayer</HI> with God for the outpouring of his Spirit on sinners to convince them of sin, to regenerate and effectually call them unto the fellowship of the Father and of his Son Christ Jesus.—And such are false teachers, and manifest they have no true care for souls, that neglect <HI>to press sinners</HI> to speedy repentance—to a speedy flight by faith to Christ for refuge—neglect to <HI>pray</HI> and <HI>beseech them</HI> in Christ's stead to be re∣conciled to God, to be at peace with him, and to live a life of universal obedience to all the revealed will of God; and neglect to do it on principle! John said, "The ax is laid to the root of the trees, every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire:"—Christ said, "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."—That such as will not <HI>cut off a right hand,</HI> or put off the old man that is corrupt, must go <HI>to hell</HI> with all their lusts, <HI>where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched</HI>; and wept over hardened Jerusalem saying, "How often would I have gathered thy children, as a hen gathers her brood under her wings and ye would not."—"Behold," &amp;c.—The Apostles called on sinners to "repent and be converted that their sins might be blotted out."—<HI>Prayed souls</HI> and <HI>beseeched them</HI> in <HI>Christ's stead</HI> to <HI>be reconciled to God,</HI> and <HI>know∣ing the terrors</HI> of the Lord <HI>persuaded men,</HI> saying, "How can ye escape if ye neglect so great salva∣tion!—Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the

dead and Christ shall give you light:—But while ye cry peace and safety to yourselves, sudden destruc∣tion shall come upon you, &amp;c."</P>
<P>Such do not care for the flock, that neglect from time to time to urge professors of religion <HI>to give all diligence</HI> to add to their faith virtue, and to vir∣tue knowledge, &amp;c. And to <HI>give diligence to make their calling and election sure</HI>;—neglect to urge them to be <HI>holy in all manner of conversation and godliness,</HI> and to <HI>give diligence to be found of the Lord in peace without spot and blameless,</HI> from a consideration, "that the heaven and the earth which now are, by the word of God are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men:"—Neglect to urge them <HI>to believe to the saving of their souls</HI> from a consideration, that such as draw back, <HI>draw back unto perdition,</HI> and God's <HI>soul has no pleasure in them,</HI> and he will <HI>swear in his wrath that they shall not enter into the rest</HI> which remains for the people of God, as he swore unbelieving Is∣rael should not enter into the promised land of Ca∣naan.—The Apostle Paul says, "I have kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, testifying both to the Jews and also unto the Greeks repentance to∣ward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ: Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men, for I have not shun∣ned to declare unto you all the counsel of God."— And again, "Whom (Christ) we preach, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus."</P>
<P N="3">3. Such are false teachers, who <HI>privily</HI> bring in <HI>damnable heresies.—Privily</HI> under sheep's cloathing— under a cloak of zeal for our good, <HI>they zealously affect you but not well.</HI>—Wrap them up <HI>in good words and fair speeches</HI> to deceive the hearts of the simple.
<PB N="19" REF="014684_0018_0F948D3E114BFE68"/>
They corrupt the word of God, retain hidden things of dishonesty—walk in craftiness, and handle the word of God deceitfully—wrest the scriptures by their forced interpretations to speak what the Holy Ghost never intended, yea, what is contrary to the letter and spirit of the written word of God.—The Apostle Paul says, "That we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with eve∣ry wind of doctrine, by the slight of men and cun∣ning craftiness, whereby they lye in wait to deceive."</P>
<P>And here it may be affirmed without the least he∣sitation, that such a person is a false teacher, who advances certain leading principles or tenets in re∣ligion, which have a tendency to produce very fatal consequences to the souls of men, if embraced, to maintain and support which, he is forced to contra∣dict the common sense of mankind, the common sen∣timents of the whole <HI>Protestant Church,</HI> and the plain and obvious meaning of Christ and the inspired Pen∣men of sacred scripture:—Such is the doctrine of <HI>universal salvation</HI> as advanced by the <HI>Stranger,</HI> his doctrine of <HI>purgatory</HI> or <HI>intermediate state,</HI> and of <HI>no application of Christ,</HI> or <HI>effectual calling, conversion,</HI> or <HI>believing in Christ</HI> as <HI>necessary</HI> in order to our being pardoned by God, justified as righteous in his sight, received into his favor, and made heirs of eternal salvation <HI>through Christ's name.</HI></P>
<P>It may also be affirmed to be an infallible mark of a false teacher, if at his first coming into a strange place, it is his practice to make use of such language only, or forms of speech as he understands con∣vey to them orthodox sentiments until he has gain∣ed their affections, and then by little and little, as he finds it will bear, to devulge his corrupt tenets in language directly contrary to what he used at first▪—That is, more open and less equivocal; thus
<PB N="20" REF="014684_0019_0F948D3EC0211C90"/>
the serpent beguiled <HI>Eve</HI> through his subtilty—and thus the Apostle feared the minds of the Corinthi∣ans would be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ, by those <HI>Ministers of satan,</HI> who <HI>transform∣ed</HI> themselves into the <HI>apostles of Christ,</HI> or <HI>as the ministers of righteousness, even</HI> as "satan himself is transformed into an angel of light."</P>
<P N="4">4. As false teachers are of the world, they speak of the world and the world heareth them; but the Apostle says, "We are of God, he that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us; hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error." And Christ says to the Jews, "I am come in my Father's name and ye receive me not; if another shall come in his own name, him <HI>ye will</HI> receive."— Again, "Why do ye not understand my speech? Even because ye cannot hear my words—and because I tell you the truth ye believe me not.—He that is of God heareth God's words, ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.—Many therefore of his disciples when they heard—said this is a hard saying, who can hear it?—From that time many of his disciples went back and no more walked with him." These were only nominal, that is to say, not <HI>disciples indeed.</HI>—Now as none can cordially acquiesce in the doctrine of Christ, but such as are born of God, because it is directly contrary to the sinful in∣clinations of our hearts, and we must deny ourselves in complying with it; we must conclude, such teach∣ers come not with the doctrine of Christ, nor in his name, but in their own name and with the spirit of the world; if wicked and carnal men find no dif∣ficulty in complying with their doctrine arising from their own corrupt and sinful inclinations, and that they would gladly become their disciples, but are
<PB N="21" REF="014684_0020_0F948D40D8941958"/>
kept back by the objections from common sense, the light of their reason and conscience, and a ra∣tional belief of the contrary truths.—Let us illus∣trate this a little.</P>
<P>Christ preaches, that we must believe in him, repent and be converted and become as little children, must deny ourselves and take up our cross daily and follow him—must forsake all that we have and love him above father, mother, wife, children, house, land, and even our own life, yea must cut off a right hand and pluck out a right eye that offends, or other∣wise we must be damned, we must go to hell with both hands and both eyes, even into a state of everlast∣ing punishment, where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched.</P>
<P>But supposing a Stranger comes into Gloucester in A. D. 1775, and teaches, "That Christ, by making complete atonement for sin by the sacrifice of him∣self, has made up the breach between God and fal∣len men, so that all men are now pardoned, all are justified, and all will finally be saved; Christ has bound up the broken in heart; my bible says he has done it. Some, indeed, speak of application to Christ as necessary, but my bible knows of no <HI>such application as necessary</HI> to our being pardoned, justi∣fied, or saved eternally; no, we are <HI>saved by grace,</HI> and <HI>justified freely through the redemption of Christ</HI>; all mankind were in Christ before the foundation of the world; all men were chosen in him <HI>in contra∣distinction to the fallen angels.</HI>—Christ having given himself a ransom for all to be testified <HI>in due time,</HI> he has made peace by the blood of his cross for all, and God is now reconciled to the world, not im∣puting to them their trespasses, and Christ is made of God unto all men wisdom, righteousness, sancti∣fication, and redemption.—As we are in Christ be∣fore

we believe, so we are pardoned and justified be∣fore we believe, and <HI>our sanctification is not in our∣selves, but in Christ as our justification is in him.</HI>—God sees no iniquity in men, all men are the children of God.—No man is a child of the devil.—The chil∣dren of the devil, or of the <HI>wicked one,</HI> are the <HI>tares,</HI> which the enemy or devil sowed in the world. Did the devil send men into this world? No, no; but sin is of the devil and there are doctrines of devils.— These sins and errors are the tares, the hay, wood, and stubble, which shall, in the end of the world be bound in bundles and sent away into that everlasting fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels.</P>
<P>"That all mankind will finally be saved and made eternally happy, appears from the declaration of the divine goodness and his will relative to this matter: <HI>As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked</HI>; and the Apostle Peter says, The Lord <HI>is long-suffering, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance,</HI> and the Apostle Paul speaking of God our Saviour, says, <HI>Who will have all men to be saved and come to the know∣ledge of the truth</HI>—nay, is it not expressly said, "<HI>As by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to con∣demnation, even so, by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.—For as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive.— Christ gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time.—He tasted death for every man.</HI>—Christ <HI>is a pro∣pitiation for the sins of the whole world,</HI> and <HI>will draw all men unto him.</HI></P>
<P>"You must be sensible, beloved, that preaching this doctrine of universal salvation, and that all are beloved of God, and interested in Christ, &amp;c. is preaching the gospel, that is, <HI>glad tidings of salvati∣on unto all people.</HI>—For how can ministers preach the

<P>"It is true, <HI>he that believeth not shall be damned,</HI> but you know that the words <HI>damned</HI> and <HI>condemned</HI> are used as synonimous, as for instance, he <HI>that doubt∣eth is damned if he eateth</HI>; and the word <HI>damnation</HI> signi∣fies some temporal <HI>loss, judgment,</HI> or <HI>calamity,</HI> when it is said, <HI>he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, for which cause some are sick∣ly,</HI> &amp;c.

We love Christ because we believe he loved us and gave himself for us.—Hence, my Brethren, away with all the <HI>damning</HI> doctrine inculcated by all the preachers in these American Colonies, <HI>except one or two at most.</HI>—You do not hear me insist upon the nature and necessity of regeneration, nor upon re∣pentance toward God and faith toward Christ as necessary to our being interested in Christ, pardon∣ed, justified, or saved; nor on our being new crea∣tures—holy as God is holy in all manner of conver∣sation and godliness—on our keeping Christ's say∣ings, attending on the administration of gospel-sa∣craments, and praying always with all prayer in se∣cret, in family, and public worship as necessary to evidence to ourselves and before men, that we are in Christ, that our faith is not a dead faith, but that we are such <HI>as are or shall be saved.</HI>—And much less do ye hear me telling the drunkard, the profane swearer, the whoremonger, &amp;c. that they must re∣pent and be converted now while they have a space to repent and the long-suffering of God is waiting on them, or else they must hereafter lift up their eyes in torments, in an unalterable state of misery, where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quench∣ed and the smoke of their torments shall ascend up forever and ever! No, no; I do not chuse to offend the ears of my hearers with such disagreable sounds, but rather, leaving this to the preachers of this land, I chuse to entertain my auditory with noble specu∣lations in divinity and explications of deep mysteries in sacred scripture, such, for instance, as the man's going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, &amp;c. that this signifies Adam's gradually falling—fall-ing—fall-ing until he quite fell among thieves, even <HI>death and the

<P>Now, my Friend, is it necessary to ask the questi∣on, which of these two sorts of doctrine and preach∣ing is the most agreable to corrupt nature, to our sinful inclinations, and the selfish spirit of the world— such as Christ and his apostles preached, as specified in the foregoing pages—or such as has been just spe∣cified above, and which your <HI>Stranger</HI> may be sup∣posed to preach quite consistently with his leading principles? You must know, Sir, that drunkards, profane swearers, whoremongers, and the most aban∣doned sinners, feel no opposition to, no quarrelling in their sinful inclinations, affections, and lusts, with such doctrine and preaching as the <HI>latter.</HI>—They do not say, <HI>it is a hard saying who can hear it?</HI> No, for it encourages them to bless themselves in their hearts, saying, <HI>we shall have peace, though we walk in the imaginations of our hearts to add drunkenness to thirst!</HI> And the little boys in your streets are already caught in the snare and say, "We may swear and curse and lie and quarrel and do what we will that is bad without any danger of going to the devil in everlasting burnings; for Mr. M— preaches that all men will be saved and be happy forever."</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="014684_0026_0F948D44B57A0870"/>This <HI>new scheme</HI> of religion is totally destitute of divinity, self-denial, and true holiness—it is <HI>Anti∣nominiasm</HI> itself—contrary to all divine law of reli∣gion and holiness.—The <HI>carnal mind,</HI> which is enmi∣ty against God, it being not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be, is <HI>cordially pleased</HI> with this new scheme!—This carnal mind is a mere <HI>selfish</HI> spirit—a selfish spirit is the very soul or spirit of wickedness, iniquity, or sin;—if a selfish spirit reigns in us, sin reigns in us, and we are the servants of sin and under the power of the devil, and hate the Fa∣ther and hate Christ, and are enemies to both:— And such persons <HI>will not</HI> come to Christ—will not believe in him—will not have him to reign over them as Lord of their conscience, faith, and obedience: They must be drawn of the Father—they must be born of God in order to believe in Christ; and must deny themselves and forsake all they have, in the act of believing:—But what is there in this new scheme, that a person wholly under the power of sin, a selfish spirit, or the carnal mind, could not heartily subscribe to? What need is there of being born of God, in order either to believe, or to love God and Christ as required in this scheme? If there is no application to Christ—no application of Christ to ourselves—no uniting to Christ in believing, an unregenerate person will be as able to believe as one that is born of God:—And if wicked men love such persons, as they believe love them, and an apprehen∣sion that others love them, is the only motive of their love to the others; then wicked men may love God and Christ with just such a love as is taught in this scheme, to be the fruit of the faith described there∣in.—The love which wicked men, who were never

born of God, have to God, to Christ, and to mankind, is wholly <HI>selfish</HI>—founded in <HI>self,</HI> even in the carnal mind, which is enmity against God; and hence is not in the least degree holy, but altogether sinful.</P>
<P>Neither does this new scheme require godly sorrow for sin—deep humiliation and repenting as in dust and ashes—watching and praying—keeping under the body and crucifying the flesh with the affections and lusts and the like, lest otherwise <HI>we die—we be∣come castaways</HI> as urged by Christ and his apostles! But on the contrary teaches, that God sees no ini∣quity in us, let us live as we list, and that strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth to de∣struction and few there be, none at all, that find it; because wide is the gate and broad is the way which leadeth to life and many there be, even all mankind, go in thereat! What is the broad way to destructi∣on, spoken of by Christ, but error and sin? And what is the narrow way to life, but faith or truth as it is in Jesus, and holiness?</P>
<P>This new scheme is a compound of heresies founded in a wrong application, a misinterpretation, a perversion, and a wresting of the holy scriptures. The written word of God contains a perfectly con∣sistent system of religion, yet every person of com∣mon sense, who reads the same with careful attention will find many words used which have not in every place precisely the same meaning, as for instance <HI>damned, saved,</HI> or <HI>damnation</HI> and <HI>salvation</HI>—the <HI>will of God—all men,</HI> &amp;c.—And the meaning may in ge∣neral be known by the context and parallel texts, or by the general analogy of sacred scripture.</P>

place to signify the same as <HI>condemned,</HI> or the word <HI>damnation,</HI> the same as <HI>judgment,</HI> even a temporal judgment; will it be agreable to common sense, from thence to conclude, that the <HI>damnation of hell, resurrection to damnation,</HI> and <HI>eternal damnation</HI> sig∣nify no more than a temporal judgment!—And wont it be just as sensible and reasonable to conclude, that if the word <HI>saved</HI> or <HI>salvation</HI> may be used in some places to signify only temporal deliverance from some judgment, eminent danger or distress; that <HI>salvation from wrath to come, eternal salvation,</HI> and a being <HI>saved</HI> as opposed to a being <HI>damned,</HI> signify no more than a <HI>temporal deliverance</HI> from some temporal judgment? Christ says, he that believeth—shall be <HI>saved</HI> and he that believeth not shall be <HI>damned</HI>; if damnation here is temporal, why not the salvation too?

should perish, but that all should come to repentance,</HI> or <HI>his willing that all men be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth</HI> as the means or way of salvation.—Even as a king's issuing out an act of grace to pardon all such rebels as will throw down their arms, submit to his government, and accept of the offered pardon, <HI>is his not willing</HI> that any of these rebels should perish as rebels, but that all should come to repentance and receive a pardon.—But there are many that <HI>resist</HI> the will of God in the gospel, make light of God's gracious calls and invitations—neglect so great sal∣vation—and will not come to Christ that they may have life—will not repent and be converted that their sins may be blotted out, but go their ways, provok∣ing the holy one of Israel to anger until he swears in his wrath, that they shall not enter in his rest, and in the great day will say to them, <HI>because I have cal∣led and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand and no man regarded; but ye have set at naught all my counsel and would none of my reproof. I also will laugh at your calamity,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>As to <HI>all men,</HI> a careful reader will observe, that it signifies sometimes <HI>all mankind,</HI> Adam with all his posterity coming into the world by ordinary genera∣tion, as when it is said, by the offence of one judgment came upon <HI>all men</HI> to condemnation.—In Adam <HI>all</HI> die.—By the deeds of the law no flesh living can be justified in his sight.—We must <HI>all</HI> stand before the judgment-seat of Christ; though when it is said, it is appointed unto all men once to die—there is an ex∣ception not only of Enoch and Elijah, but of many millions who shall remain alive upon earth at the coming of Christ—<HI>we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed.</HI>—Sometimes <HI>all sorts</HI> of men, as, that—
<PB N="32" REF="014684_0031_0F948D4CEAC6AF00"/>
supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for <HI>all men</HI>; for kings, and for <HI>all</HI> that are in authority.—We are not required in the word of God to pray for those that are in heaven; nor for those in hell, or in your STRANGER's <HI>inter∣mediate state,</HI> his <HI>purgatory</HI>; nor for such on earth as have sinned the sin unto death; nor for the eternal salvation of the non-elect.—And sometimes <HI>all men</HI> signify <HI>all that the Father gave Christ out of the world of mankind—all</HI> that the Father <HI>chose</HI> in Christ before the foundation of the world, that they might be ho∣ly, &amp;c. <HI>All that were predestinated</HI> to the adoption of sons by Jesus Christ—<HI>all that Christ calls his sheep</HI> for whom he laid down his life with a special design to save;—<HI>all</HI> called his <HI>seed,</HI> for whose sins Christ made his soul an offering;—<HI>all foreordained</HI> to be Christ's church, which he loved and gave himself for that &amp;c.—<HI>foreordained</HI> to be members of his body, and he to be their head as the <HI>second public man; the se∣cond Adam</HI>:—As the <HI>first man</HI>—the <HI>first Adam</HI> had his body to which he stood related as head, so the <HI>se∣cond man</HI>—the <HI>second Adam</HI> has his body to which he stands related as head; and as the body, or <HI>all men</HI> of the <HI>first Adam</HI> were his <HI>natural</HI> seed by natu∣ral generation and birth, so the body, or <HI>all men</HI> of the <HI>second Adam</HI> are his <HI>spiritual</HI> seed by a spiritual birth, by regeneration—created in Christ Jesus unto good works;—hence, when it is said, by the righteous∣ness of one the free gift came upon <HI>all men</HI> to justifi∣cation of life—in Christ shall <HI>all</HI> be made alive— who gave himself a ransom for <HI>all.</HI>—Tasted death for <HI>every man</HI>—there is no difficulty in understanding <HI>all men—all</HI> and <HI>every man</HI>—to mean, <HI>all</HI> that were <HI>chosen</HI> in Christ—<HI>chosen</HI> to salvation through sancti∣fication
<PB N="33" REF="014684_0032_0F948D4D0A5128B8"/>
of the spirit and belief of the truth—<HI>all given</HI> to the Son by the Father that <HI>shall come</HI> to him, and whom Christ will in no wise cast out.—We must either understand it thus, or else that by the righte∣ousness of one the free gift came upon <HI>all mankind</HI> unto justification of life, and <HI>all mankind</HI> shall be made alive in Christ, and that Christ gave himself a ransom for <HI>all mankind</HI> with an absolute design to save the whole and every man in particular.—But this latter we know is false, because multitudes <HI>die in their sins, will be raised up</HI> at the last day <HI>to damnation,</HI> and <HI>be punished with an everlasting destruction</HI> from the pre∣sence of the Lord and the glory of his power!</P>
<P>Yet as Christ took on him <HI>that human nature,</HI> which is common to all men, whether considered as elect or not; as he brought in an everlasting righteousness for the justification of men—by his obedience <HI>to that law,</HI> which is the law of righteous∣ness unto all men.—And obtained redemption for men, by suffering, the just for the unjust, to the full satisfaction of divine justice, <HI>that penalty</HI> which all mankind stood bound by the sentence of condem∣nation to suffer; it follows, that his righteousness and atonement are as sufficient for the justification, par∣don and salvation of one sinner among men as another, and for every sinner of mankind individually con∣sidered; and that God can, as consistently with the honor of his moral law and government, on Christ's account, pardon, justify, and save one as another, and every one equally that shall accept of his gra∣cious offer.</P>
<P>And as God's method of addressing himself to men in the ministry of reconciliation, by setting before
<PB N="34" REF="014684_0033_0F948D4DC3458258"/>
them life and death, a blessing and a curse, yea, by holding out to them pardon, justification, and eter∣nal life as a free-gift, and inviting, beseeching, and praying them by his ambassadors to accept of the same, or otherwise they must eternally perish, is a treating men as men, as reasonable creatures, drawing <HI>them with the cords of a man.</HI>—And as he addresses himself to men in the ministry of reconci∣liation, not immediately, but through the instrumen∣tality of his ambassadors who know not the hearts of men, nor whether all to whom they are sent to preach are elect or not—one has as good a warrant to be∣live in Christ the Saviour as another, to whom Christ is preached:—And as every one is to blame for not believing in Christ, it is his own fault that he doth not, because he either sinfully neglects, voluntarily makes light of, or wickedly treads under foot the offer, and will not come to Christ that he might have life; it fol∣lows, that it is the duty of one sinner as much as of another and of every one alike under the gospel, to re∣pent, to come to Christ, or believe in him: And as God knows none can, none ever will come to Christ and be saved, except he draws them by his efficacious grace, and yet when drawn they actually come—be∣living in Christ as set before us in that gospel which is committed unto his ambassadors to preach to every human creature, and commonly are drawn, and do come while hearing the blessed gospel preached, for faith comes by hearing, &amp;c. And as they come to that Christ that all are invited to come to, be∣living no one proposition but what all are required to believe and cordially accepting of that offer only which is made to all in the gospel:—It follows, that such as are saved, are saved wholly by grace in
<PB N="35" REF="014684_0034_0F948D4EA2B79A90"/>
a way that excludes all boasting from themselves. And that such as perish under the gospel are wholly inexcusable for their neglect and will be punished for not believing on the name of the Son of God.— And as Christ's righteousness and atonement are suffi∣cient for the salvation of the whole world; and as all mankind in general, by virtue of Christ's media∣tion and merits, have a temporary salvation—a day of God's forbearance—a space to repent, or a time of probation.—And as God is in Christ reconciling the world unto himself—Christ may be called the <HI>Sa∣viour of all men—the Saviour of the world</HI>—and <HI>a pro∣pitiation for the sins of the whole world,</HI> so far, that whosoever, in all the world, believeth in him, shall be saved;—yea, that if the whole world would re∣pent and believe in Christ, as God commands them to do in the gospel, they should be saved.—And yet such as will not believe in him, shall be damned.— In an army there is one instituted to be a Surgeon-General to the whole army—all the sick and wound∣ed in the army have a right, by virtue of his being a Surgeon-General, to apply to him; yet such as will not apply, or do refuse the use of his means, will receive no benefit by him:—Christ is by office the Saviour, and only Saviour of the world—there is none other name given under heaven whereby men must be saved—all are called upon to come to him, where the gospel comes.—Whosoever believeth in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life—and him that cometh to Christ, he will in no wise cast out; but such as will not come unto Christ that they may have life, abide in death, and the wrath of God abi∣deth on them:—Yet all that the Father giveth Christ shall come.—God has engaged, in the cove∣nant
<PB N="36" REF="014684_0035_0F948D4F36EC9F88"/>
of redemption, on condition of Christ's making his soul an offering for sin, and his bearing the sins of many, that he shall see his <HI>seed</HI> and by his knowledge justify them.—Hence from the considerations above, it appears, that God may as sincerely offer salvation to such as he knows will never accept of it, as to such as he is determined to make willing to accept of it in the day of his power, for God may sincerely treat men as men or as reasonable creatures.—It also appears, that such as do believe in Christ, in the act of believing, do not believe any one proposition but what such are called upon to believe as finally perish in unbelief; nor accept of any thing but what is offered to all alike in the gospel. Hence saving faith is not a believing that I am in Christ, that God is reconciled to me, and sees no iniquity in me.—That my sins are pardoned, that I was never a child of the devil, &amp;c.—But it is a seeing the Son as the true God and only and alsufficient Saviour of men, and a believing in him, trusting in him alone for sal∣vation—a fleeing to Christ for refuge from pursuing vengeance to lay hold on him as the hope set before us—a coming to Christ weary and heavy-laden with the burden of sin and guilt for rest—a coming to Christ, sensibly perishing with hunger and thirst, as to a feast, eating his flesh and drinking his blood, as meat indeed and drink indeed:—A bowing the knee at the name of Jesus, cordially submitting to him as Prince and Saviour, Lord and Christ, counting all our own righteousness as loss and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But as to your strange notion, that all mankind were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world, in <HI>contradistinction to fallen angels,</HI> I do not
<PB N="37" REF="014684_0036_0F948D4FF8E9E2A0"/>
know of one text of scripture that can be forced, even by misinterpretation, to shew the least counte∣nance to it.—Let us consider it in relation to a few texts where <HI>election</HI> is mentioned, viz. <HI>Many are called but few are chosen.</HI> Have the fallen angels ever been called? Christ says, "I lay down my life for the sheep—my Father gave them me—but ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep." Were these fallen angels that were not of Christ's sheep?— Again, "I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me <HI>out of the world</HI>; thine they were and thou gavest them me—I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them, which thou hast given me; for they are thine: "Doth the <HI>world</HI> here signify fallen angels?—Again, "And as many as were ordained to eternal life believed." Were all those fallen angels who did not believe? For it is certain there were mul∣titudes who did not believe so much as the devils did! Jesus I know and Paul I know, but who are ye? said the evil spirit.—Again, "Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a <HI>remnant shall be saved</HI>—even so then at this present time also there is a remnant accord∣ing to the election of grace.—The election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded."—Were the <HI>rest</HI> and all beside the remnant, (the election) fallen angels?—Once more, "Give diligence to make your calling and election sure." Doth it mean that we are to give deligence to make sure that we are men and not fallen angels?</P>
<P>And as to your notion that the <HI>tares,</HI> explained to be the children of the wicked one, the devil, sig∣nify, not wicked men, not heretics, but sins and
<PB N="38" REF="014684_0037_0F948D50C9CE9308"/>
heresies, which shall be gathered together bound in bundles and burnt in the end of the world, it is too senseless to be maintained by any person in his right mind and professing to be guided by the scrip∣tures of truth! Christ expressly says, he means, by the tares, the children of the wicked one, the devil, and by the children of the wicked one he means, <HI>them that do iniquity,</HI> and that these shall be cast into a furnace of fire, not to purify, but to torment them, where their torment is expressed by <HI>wailing and gnash∣ing of teeth.</HI>—Are sins and heresies subjects capable of pain and torment!!! But to wicked men Christ will say, in the judgment, "Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire—I was hungry and ye gave me no meat," &amp;c. Christ is speaking to wicked men, when he says, <HI>Ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do.</HI>—Paul calls <HI>Elymas</HI> the sorcerer a <HI>child of the devil</HI>—because he was <HI>full of subtilty and all mischief</HI>—an <HI>enemy of all righteousness:</HI> And the apostle John says, Such men as <HI>commit sin are of the devil,</HI> that is, who are <HI>workers of sin</HI>—live in sin, and these he expressly calls <HI>the children of the devil</HI> as opposed to the <HI>children of God,</HI> who are <HI>born of God,</HI> do not <HI>commit sin</HI> but do righteousness, and are righ∣teous even as their Father is righteous.—Their sanctification is not out of themselves, for they are created in Christ unto good works—are re∣newed in the spirit of their mind—created after God in righteousness and true holiness, are new creatures—have crucified the flesh with the affecti∣ons and lusts and have put on the new-man, and as the elect of God, holy and beloved, have put on bowels of mercies, kindness, gentleness, humble∣ness of mind, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="014684_0038_0F948D51764A3180"/>Dear Sir, time will fail me to say all that I want to say, to recover you out of the snare of the devil. The scriptures speak of false teachers bringing in privily <HI>damnable heresies,</HI> and of some being given up to a strong delusion to believe a lie that they might be damned, and this as a punishment for not <HI>receiv∣ing the love of the truth that they might be saved!</HI> I am sure that the leading doctrines in this new scheme are damnable heresies, because they are false doc∣trines, also when embraced for truth will <HI>effectually keep persons easy and secure in an unconverted, Christ∣less state.</HI>—And how is it possible for a godly man, an experienced christian, who has received the love of the truth to be carried away with such gross er∣rors, so contrary to the plain letter of the word, and common sense, and gracious experience of all the godly?—Christ says, <HI>if it were possible</HI> they would deceive the <HI>very elect</HI>: Persons must be infa∣tuated or bewitched by a spirit of delusion, as the <HI>foolish Galatians</HI> were, to be captivated into a belief of such palpable errors!</P>
<P>Once I did hope that you was a good man, that you had received the love of the truth—<HI>you did run well, who hath hindered you?</HI> But if you was ever truly converted to God through faith in Christ the Mediator, you was convinced of sin—that it ren∣dered you obnoxious to the wrath and curse of God—you saw yourself in a condemned state, in danger of eternal damnation in hell—the wrath of God revealed from heaven against you—your feet standing in slippery places—you was pricked in your heart, and with the three thousand, cried, What must I do? Or, with the publican, God be merci∣ful

to me a sinner! You saw yourself condemned by the <HI>just judgment of God,</HI> so that your mouth was stopped and you felt yourself guilty before God.— You found also, your heart was a heart of stone, contrary to that which is good—full of enmity against God—that you stood in absolute need of a new heart and a right spirit:—You was also con∣vinced, if you was ever saved, it must be in the way of free, sovereign grace!—And if you are truly converted, you was also convinced of righteousness and judgment; Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth—that by his obedience and death has brought in an everlasting righteousness and made complete atonement for sin. You saw Christ in his person and offices to be alto∣gether lovely, desirable, precious, and suitable, so that your whole soul united to him and count∣ed all things as loss and dung for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, to win Christ and be found in him.—You now began to find peace with God, began to delight in God and his holy law, and to wage war against sin, all sin, and to feel a bene∣volent affection towards all men, desiring that all might have repentance toward God and faith to∣ward our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, that their sins <HI>might be</HI> pardoned and their souls made happy in the favor, friendship, and fellowship of the Fa∣ther, Son, and Holy Ghost, in walking in the light of truth and holiness as God is in the light.—Now a change of this importance every true christian is experimentally acquainted with: And Christ's mi∣nisters are travelling in birth of their people that Christ may thus be formed in them; and if you have experienced a change of such importance, how
<PB N="41" REF="014684_0040_0F948D58045EA700"/>
unaccountable is it, that you should be carried away after one, whose avowed principles necessarily teach, That such a change is needless, and that all convictions of danger of <HI>eternal punishment</HI> and <HI>wrath to come,</HI> which <HI>move</HI> sinners <HI>to strive to enter in</HI> at the strait gate—to <HI>press</HI> into the kingdom, (whereby the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force) and to flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before them, <HI>are a meer delu∣sion!</HI> Pray consider these things—and the Lord give you understanding in all things:—It is no light matter to be deceived in such matters as these—or to be turned aside by a deceived heart, so as not to be able to say, <HI>Is there not a lye in my right hand?</HI>—Christ says, "If any man will do God's will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself—and every one that is of the truth, heareth my voice."</P>
<P>To conclude, if you, Sir, or any other person, shall maintain for scripture-truth, that the whole race of Adam, or all mankind will finally be saved and happy; and that application or union to Christ by faith is not necessary to our enjoying any saving benefit of Christ, or the like, I am as sure that you, or such an one, is under a strong delusion to believe a lye, as I am that the bible is a book of divine reve∣lation, or that there is salvation in Christ for men! adieu.—I am your hearty welwisher,</P>

<P>THAT cannot be true christian doctrine, which naturally tends to turn the grace of God into lasciviousness: But such is the doctrine of universal salvation, at taught by this Stranger, for nothing can have a greater tendency that way than to teach, that all men shall be finally happy, even though they live and die Pagans, Mahometans, worship∣pers of the Antichristian-Beast, open enemies to the cross of Christ, whoremongers, adulterers, blasphemers, murderers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That cannot be true christian doctrine, which is agreable to corrupt nature, or to that mere selfish spirit the carnal mind which is enmity against God: But such is the doctrine of universal salvation; for nothing can be more agreable to carnal and wicked persons than this doctrine, that they shall have peace and be finally happy, though they walk all their days in the imagination or stubbornness of their own evil hearts, adding drunkenness to thirst, or the like.</P>
<P>That cannot be true christian doctrine, which teaches, that it is no matter, as to our future well-being, what our religion is in this world, whether the christian or the pagan! Or whom we worship, the true God, or idols! Or whom we serve and obey, Christ, or the devil! But such is this doctrine of universal salvation; and hence it will not be at all strange, for those who embrace it, to live, by and by, in the entire neglect of the instituted worship of God as commanded by Christ, of family religion, and become openly, after awhile, as their consciences grow more and more feared by resisting the light, <HI>downright practical Atheists.</HI></P>
<P>That cannot be true christian doctrine, which tends to make all, who embrace it, Deists or Infidels: But such is this doctrine of universal salva∣tion; for such as embrace it, cannot embrace it, because it appears more evidently to common sense to be scripture-doctrine than that of the ever∣lasting punishment of impenitent sinners in hell; nor because they can interpret what the holy scriptures say of the eternal damnation of the wicked, so as to make the same consistent with the doctrine of universal salvation, without doing the greatest violence to the common sense, or meaning of words and language.—What boldness and violence too, to say, the <HI>chaff</HI> or <HI>tares,</HI> which shall be burnt in unquenchable fire, sig∣nify, not men, but the sins and error of men, when they cannot but know, that Christ says, <HI>They are the children of the wicked one, and they that do iniquity!</HI> — Also, to say, the <HI>goats,</HI> on the left hand of the Judge, signify not men, but either the sins of men, or devils themselves, when they cannot but know Christ says, the <HI>sheep</HI> and <HI>goats</HI> are the <HI>righteous</HI> and
<PB N="43" REF="014684_0042_0F948D59C3470CE0"/>
<HI>wicked</HI> of <HI>all nations,</HI> and that as the righteous shall go away into life eternal, so the wicked shall into everlasting punishment, represented by fire unquenchable or everlasting!—Now he that will do such violence to the meaning of some passages of sacred scripture to establish a particular tenet, would do violence to every passage to serve a turn, and thereby proves himself to be an infidel, and hence that he never embraced this doctrine of universal salvation from a conviction of divine authority for it, but because it was agreable to corrupt nature: Men that do not like to deny themselves and take up their cross daily in following Christ— that do not chuse to have Christ to reign over them, nor to keep his com∣mandments, would be glad to persuade themselves of enjoying happiness hereafter without passing the strait gate into the narrow way of holiness and self-denial, even in the broad way that the multitude goes in to do evil; for what wicked man is there that would not heartily like to serve the devil all his days, or the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and would not do it, if he could persuade himself that he should be happy for all this, or should not suffer for it in the coming world?—And they that have fallen in with this persuasion, commonly advance this argument for it; "That God is a merciful Being" and therefore for him to damn any of mankind forever would be inconsistent with the goodness of his nature, and imply that he made creatures to damn them, which is a thought they cannot entertain of so good a Being:—Which necessarily supposes several things, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. That devils will either be finally happy, or else, as they are crea∣tures as much as sinful men, God created them to damn them forever: By the way, God made angels and men for his glory; but fallen angels and fallen men have fitted themselves for destruction.</P>
<P N="2">2. That there was no need of the sacrifice or atonement of Christ, in order for our discharge from condemnation; for if it was inconsistent with the nature of divine goodness to punish us with everlasting destruc∣tion for our sins, what need could there be of Christ's dying for us to re∣deem us from the curse of the la<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and deliver us from the wrath which is to come, that we were condemned unto? Yea, how came God to condemn us to everlasting punishment, if it was inconsistent with the nature of his goodness to inflict it upon us? Or if it was not an everlasting punishment that Christ died to redeem us from, what was it?—Only a temporal punishment, which would have had an end, though he had not died for us! Then Christ died in vain, and the Deists are right, and the bible is a book of non-sense!—If I were to em∣brace this new doctrine I would be so honest and consistent with myself, as at the same time to fling away the bible, for it is impossible to recon∣cile it with the bible-religion, let common sense be judge.</P>
<P N="3">3. That those persons, who plead the above argument, have no proper conviction and sense of the moral rectitude of God, his moral law and government—of the nature, evil, and demerit of sin—of the nature of the remission of sin and of salvation from it, nor of the nature and necessity of the atonement by Christ in order to the same.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="014684_0043_0F948D5A83C63F60"/>In a word, that cannot be true christian doctrine, but <HI>damnable heresy,</HI> which makes sad the hearts of the godly, as it encourages wicked and vicious persons to live without fear of eternal punishment, in the neglect of repentance—of their own salvation—of <HI>religion and virtue, in the prac∣tice of every vice.</HI></P>
<P>The following anecdote was communicated to me by a person of repu∣tation, who assured me that there was good authority for the truth of it, viz.</P>
<P>Turning to a part of his audience, where a number of privateers-men were swearing at one another, said, "Well, you may go on and drink and swear and damn your fellow-men and blaspheme your Maker and think to dishonor him; but you do not dishonor him at all; you only magnify his grace and display the merits of Christ so much the more."— Huzza! Good doctrine for privateers-men! cried out a certain C— of a privateer.</P>
<P>It would not be acting out of character in the least for that person to address vicious persons in such a manner, who asserts and endeavors to propagate, that all men shall finally be happy, and that the most vicious and criminal persons are beloved of God, if not as much beloved of God, while in the practice of sin, as after they become penitent and virtuous.— Query 1. Whether such a teacher is not a minister of satan, an encourag∣er of vice and irreligion, and an enemy to virtue and pure religion? Query 2. Whether such a teacher ought not to be taken care of by au∣thority as an enemy to mankind and a bane to civil society? "Righte∣ousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people;—one sin∣ner destroyeth much good—Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth."—God saw, in certain pretended prophets of Jerusalem, "an horrible thing; they commit adultery, and walk in lies; they <HI>strengthen</HI> also the hands of <HI>evil-doers</HI> that <HI>none doth return from his wickedness</HI>; they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomor∣rah. Therefore, thus saith the Lord of hosts concerning (those) prophets, Behold, I will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the wa∣ter of gall; for from (these) prophets of Jerusalem is PROFANENESS <HI>gone forth into all the land.</HI>—Thus saith the Lord of hosts, <HI>hearken not</HI> un∣to the words of (these) prophets, that prophesy unto you; THEY MAKE YOU VAIN; they <HI>speak a vision of their own heart,</HI> and <HI>not out of the mouth</HI> of the Lord; they say still unto them that despise me, the Lord hath said, YE SHALL HAVE PEACE; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, NO EVIL SHALL COME UPON YOU." Jer. xxiii. 14, 17.</P>

<P>"I Have much sorrow of heart considering the state of affairs among us.—I am far advanced in life, and labor under threatning ma∣ladies, and know not how soon I may be taken from you and from this world. As one drawing near the eternal world I would give you cau∣tion—<HI>Take heed what you hear.</HI> The seeds of heresy are sowing and sprouting up among us; and souls are in danger of being seduced into errors.</P>
<P>"There is one, who calls himself <HI>John Murray,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not the Reverend Mr, <HI>John Murray,</HI> of <HI>Boothbay.</HI></NOTE> who has declared the following things to be his settled opinion.—That the whole human race, every one of Adam's posterity, have an <HI>interest</HI> in Christ and are God's beloved ones.—That the whole human race, every individual of mankind shall finally be saved.—That Judas shall sit upon a throne in the kingdom of heaven.—That at death the good go into happi∣ness and the bad into an intermediate state, a place of misery, to
<PB N="46" REF="014684_0045_0F948D5C19327850"/>
abide there for a certain season, but shall finally be saved; which how∣ever dressed up in soft terms and smooth expressions, is the very po∣pish purgatory.</P>
<P>"The substance of these things, and many other errors, he hath openly avowed and fully declared to be his sentiments, at my house, in the hearing of many witnesses. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"The witnesses are men of reputation for veracity, solid judgment, and religion, and are ready to attest the truth of what is related in this ad∣dress, and would do it, if there was need of it."</NOTE> These are unscriptural tenets, and notwithstanding all his perverting of the holy scriptures, and wresting and torturing the word of God, he was not able to produce one plausible proof, nor one rational argument for the support of these pericious prin∣ciples.—They naturally lead to many other gross errors and popish absur∣dities.—And they are extremely dangerous to the souls of men: They encourage the wicked in their wickedness; for upon these principles a man may live and die in sin, and yet go to heaven at last; he may get drunk, and commit fornication and adultery, he may cheat, and steal, and lye, and indulge all manner of carnal gratifications, and be saved notwithstanding.</P>
<P>"But you may say, you do not discover any of these errors in his preaching.—Why others, who have been accounted serious, discern∣ing, judicious men, and whose judgment would heretofore have had some weight in your minds, have discovered them in his public discourses.</P>
<P>"But however, he seems artfully to hide them, your minds are not prepared to receive them, your affections must first be broke off from your ministers, and your minds filled with prejudices against them by their being reviled and vilified, and your affections set upon him∣self, and you brought to receive the words of his mouth with an im∣plicit faith, then doubtless these dangerous doctrines, and many others, will be inculcated.</P>
<P>"My brethren and friends, I must caution you to take heed and be∣ware of false teachers. Beware, lest ye be led away with errors and fall from your stedfastness.—Beware of false prophets, concerning whom our blessed Saviour hath warned us, <HI>that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect.</HI></P>
