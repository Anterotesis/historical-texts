<HEAD>A Friend's Discourse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>BUT this I confess unto thee, that af∣ter the way which they call Heresy, so worship I the God of my Fathers.</HI>
For to this Effect was the Confes∣sion of one, when he was had before the Rulers. It seems that there were in ancient Days that were accounted Hereticks, and yet according to what we find written in the Word of Truth, were the true Worship∣pers of God. May you all that are here present become such, is the desire of my Soul. Let Men account of you whatever they may, yet if you are those true Wor∣shippers of God, you will not be ashamed to confess it before the Children of Men; tho' you may be scorn'd and abus'd; when you are sensible that you are those that worship God, and are right, will not be
<PB N="4" REF="003028_0005_0FEFAE61BB582380"/>
backward. But if it should so happen, that you come to be Sufferers, and to be had before the Rulers, and to be falsly accused in divers respects, as the Followers of Christ were in the Apostles Days yet dare not to deny that you are the Worshippers of God. And we find Christ our blessed Lord, in∣forming the Woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> at <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Well, which way to worship God, and let us see that we are found in this way, is acceptable to God, in our Worship and Service unto him this Day, and all our Days, that we may have the Spirit, and then no Question at all, but when it shall please God to put a Period to our Days here, we shall find acceptance with him: For though we may be rejected by the Children of Men, and slighted, and ill used, yet those that are found true worship∣pers of God, let them go under what Deno∣mination whatsoever, they shall find accep∣tance. And indeed in their Offerings unto the Lord, he will in no wise reject them that are fearers of God, and workers of Righteousness, whatsoever their Names may be, for God is no respecter of Persons, but all Nations that work Righteousness shall be accepted by him. May you and I be
<PB N="5" REF="003028_0006_0FEFAE6485F129F8"/>
of this Number, and in order to that we ought to wait upon God, for what are we as the Apostle says, <HI>of our selves we can do nothing,</HI> unless we are abilitated by the Spi∣rit of God; that we may keep to it and wait for it. And it is the desire of my Soul, although many of the Children of Men so scandalize it, that People wait for the Spirit of God, and they dare not Preach, and they dare not Pray, untill they feel and are abilitated by his Power Divine, for we know not how to Pray as we ought, but the Spirit in us with sighs and groanings, that may not be heard by Mortals, being yet Divine; but he hears, and he knows, and he knows in whose Heart it is to Fear and to Serve him. I hope there is a num∣ber though small, a number gather'd toge∣ther, that are desirous to worship the Lord in their Days and Generations.</P>
<P>But as I said before of the Woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> by <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Well; when we find our blessed Lord came to her, at that same time we may find that they fell into a Case, or as it were a Discourse about the worship of God and the like. And he inform'd her as we may read, if I'm not mistaken, in the fourth Chapter of <HI>John,</HI> that the true
<PB N="6" REF="003028_0007_0FEFAE6620AE4D70"/>
Worshippers should worship the Father, in Spirit and in Truth, and such was God seeking to worship Him: He further in∣form'd her of all that ever she had done, and she went away convinced, that it was our blessed Lord and Saviour; and she was made to make some Publication of it, and she went away. —<HI>And come see a Man that told me all that ever I did.</HI> Well, she seem'd to be in earnest, and invites and many Be∣liev'd, not only because of her saying it, but they went and saw for themselves. Now what we invite the Children of Men to, is to make some proof, and come and see for themselves, if they have not something that will be of force unto them all; they will have the Spirit, and he will Instruct them for that end. They have had a Spirit that has been contrary to the Divine Will and Pleasure of God; for he indeed does show unto Men and Women, what influences them in order that they may forsake the evil of it; and cease to do evil and learn to do well. And although their Souls have been as Scar∣let, and as deep Crimson, yet upon ceasing to do evil, and learning to do well, he will wash them as white as Snow, and as Wool: may we all come to be wash'd, from the evil
<PB N="7" REF="003028_0008_0FEFAE6B07B298A8"/>
of our doings; for we must confess we have all sinned, as the Apostle says, and come short of the Glory of God. Therefore this Remnant have apply'd themselves to the great Physician, who is willing to pardon the Children of Men, and to blot out their Iniquities; and now being washed, and now being cleansed, and now being sanctified, for as we may read in the Scriptures of Truth, <HI>know ye not that no unrighteous one shall inherit God's Kingdom.</HI> And he reckons up, Evil-doers, Idolaters, Effeminate, and Adulterers, yet says he, <HI>such were some of you:</HI> But yet, had the Lord mercy on such, that were not fit for his kingdom? Yes, <HI>for now are ye washed, and now are ye cleansed,</HI> &amp;c. Here was a spiritual work manifested unto them, and we must come to, and now being clean∣sed, and now being born of the Spirit, and now being born of Water, and now being cleansed, otherwise we shall never be fit for God's kingdom, according to the foregoing Chapter, as we may read in the 3d. of <HI>John,</HI> Our blessed Lord inform'd <HI>Nichodemus</HI> that was a Ruler, and that came to Jesus by night, if I mistake not he inform'd him, and told him that <HI>unless a Man was born again, he cou'd not see the kingdom of God. How can this be?</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="003028_0009_0FEFAE6E40503728"/>
saith <HI>Nichodemus, Can a Man enter a second time into his Mothers Womb</HI>? It seems he was carnally minded, and apply'd the speech of our blessed Lord carnally, and then he fur∣ther explains it, <HI>Except a Man be born of Water, and of the Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. Now I believe many have had the Work of the Spirit of God on their Hearts, as well as he; May we all apply our selves to him for all our Doubts, that he would teach us the way we should walk in, and if we do, he will no doubt dicover to every individual of us what way we may come to be born again.</P>
<P>I confess my self I had my Education a∣mongst those called Quakers, yet when the Lord was pleas'd by his great mercy to visit me, and to bring me under a concern to know what I shou'd do to inherit eternal life; I was ready to submit to every thing that I was made to know was my Duty, and if it was any outward Ceremony my Parents came short of, yet I knew I must do my work my self: thus when I read that passage of our blessed Lord to <HI>Nichodemus,</HI> I was ready to submit to the Ceremony of Water, which can only wash the outward Man, from hence 'twas practic'd from him, and it was the same that had done it, and those that
<PB N="9" REF="003028_0010_0FEFAE7171AD8B68"/>
were commanded to do it took it from Christ: And thus I was for some time, and apply'd my self unto God that I might not miss of the salvation of my Soul. And I de∣sire none to take up Religion from Educati∣on, of what Form soever, but that we may know of our being fitted for God's king∣dom, perhaps we shall never be fit for his kingdom. I hope there are many of the Children of Men thus informed, and as you keep up that appearance you have in your selves, although some times it seems very small, even like a grain of Mustard-seed, yet if you have Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ which teacheth you at times and seasons, to deny all ungodliness and lusts of the World. We find the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> was very positive when he wrote to <HI>Titus,</HI> and says, <HI>the grace of God which bringeth salvation, hath appeared unto all Men,</HI> he will's not the Death of a Sinner, but had rather that he turn and live, and the good Spirit of God teacheth you <HI>to deny worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righ∣teously, and godly</HI>; may you keep the teach∣ings of it, you need no teaching but the ho∣ly anointing in you, teacheth you, and there∣fore it is that we call upon the Children of Men, and invite them to come and see and
<PB N="10" REF="003028_0011_0FEFAE73F1D80E38"/>
live. I remember I saw one that was very ancient in years &amp; stricken, &amp; he had lived to that time he had lost his sight, and he had a visitation, and he express'd himself a little before his departure, He was not one that made Profession with us as a People, yet he humbled himself before the Lord, and was made to possess the Sins of his Youth, and all that ever he had done was brought to his remembrance. I wish the Children of Men would consider, and apply them∣selves to God for mercy, and not justify themselves in any thing short of a Justificati∣on in the sight of God. I have known such a one, and I hope and believe there are ma∣ny that have apply'd themselves to God; I can say, that while I speak unto you, I have applyed my self unto the Lord; the Lord have mercy on me, the Lord wash me, and make me clean. I was sensible he was to lead me by his judgments, and as I waited on the Lord I can say, that it was the com∣fort of the Lord when I was made sensible, that when the wicked Man that has liv'd unrighteously, turns from his unrighteous∣ness, all his wickedness that he hath done shall not be remember'd. I vow my spirit was humbled before the Lord, and many
<PB N="11" REF="003028_0012_0FEFAE758E103840"/>
times when I am employed my self in the Assemblies of God's People, I was desirous of God the Lord to search me and to prove me: It was the language of a good Man in ancient Days, that God would search him and try him. And although they may be accounted Hereticks, and the way they Worship call'd Heresy, yet I find for I can say it is not my manner, to prepare any thing for to deliver to any People, but to wait on the Lord, and this Passage of ho∣ly Scripture came into my Remembrance, how that one made a Profession, in the way which they called Heresy.</P>
<P>And because you be those that thus wor∣ship the God of your Fathers, I believe that many have been godly concerned, when they have believed that they might wor∣ship God acceptably. And I am glad I can say to see you thus but some who frequent∣ly come to scoff in Derision, and mocking, yet blessed be the Name of the Lord the Lord will visit, and influence the Children of Men, and will not lay unto their charge that they may be ignorant. I remember the Apostle <HI>Stephen</HI> when he was stoned, and persecuted; there was a Spirit in him, &amp; he pray'd, <HI>Lord, lay not this Sin unto their charge,</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="003028_0013_0FEFAE77F9AC09C0"/>
And I have charitable Thoughts that some have been ignorant, and hardly knew what they did, yet blessed be the Lord Truth does spread, and is predominant: And if you do as those that are Professors ought to do, do but live answerable to your Pro∣fession, according to the influence of the Light you make a Profession of, you will be as Way-marks to the Children of Men. For we are People that make a Profession of the Light of Jesus Christ, that has light∣ed every Man that has come into the World, though some say it was insufficient, but the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> says it was not insuffi∣cient; but the Grace of God, he might have said the Light of Christ, hath appear∣ed unto all Men; and what did it discover? why it teacheth them to deny all Ungod∣liness, and worldly Lusts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> May you keep the teachings of it, and may I, is the desire of my Soul, whensoever we appear before the Lord. May we call upon him, and breath unto him, that he would abili∣tate us, to perform acceptable Service unto him; so I desire for my own Soul that I may thus worship God aright, which is per∣form'd in Spirit and in Truth, as I have mention'd before, for God seeks, such to
<PB N="13" REF="003028_0014_0FEFAE7A46C1DBC0"/>
Worship him in this latter Age, as well as when his Son was upon the Earth, in that Body prepared by the Father to do his Will, and I am sensible that there is a Remnant here at this time, desirous to wait upon him and cry unto him, that he would abi∣litate them to Worship him. That they may acceptably Worship him, is not only to bow the Head, but it is to bow the Heart to; and I must confess <HI>Mary Mag∣dalen</HI>
Worshiped the Lord, when she wash∣ed his Feet with her Tears, and wiped them with her Hairs. There was great Love in her Heart to her Saviour that had Mercy on her, and indeed where is much forgiven there is great Love. Do you con∣sider the kindness and goodness of God unto you, he has strengthned you daily, and he has strived with you as with <HI>Jerusa∣lem, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, how often would I have gather'd you but you would not.</HI> Friends, the Mercy of God was extended in a large degree unto them, and so it has been unto the Inhabi∣tants of <HI>New-England,</HI> may not you requite Evil for Good, but cry unto him that he might prepare you that you might serve, to prepare your Hearts that you may serve
<PB N="14" REF="003028_0015_0FEFAE0A753F06F8"/>
to Worship him acceptably in your Gene∣rations: For indeed some Men may meet with difficulties which they are not aware of in Duty, though it has been thus that many have had wherewithal, and have been thus, and have had free liberty to worship and serve the Lord according to their Per∣swasions; yet we know not how the Lord may work, and what overturnings may come. We have to bless the Name of the Lord, that he has thus wrought for the rem∣nant of his People, by his Spirit. I desire my Brethren, and Sisters, in all humility be∣fore God, to reverence him and to be thank∣ful, that he has thus order'd, and has thus work'd on the Hearts of those in Authority, that we have free liberty to work towards our Maker. I can tell you it has sometimes humbled me, and that sometimes when my Head has been upon my Pillow, to God that has thus wrought: May we offer unto him, the Sacrifices of a broken Heart, and of a contrite Spirit, which he will not despise.</P>

<HEAD>Part of a Second Discourse, Delivered the same Day, By <HI>another Friend.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Would in Charity hope, and do believe, that the Intent and Designs of our Mind generally is; I speak unto such as are come unto Years of understanding, we all intend one way, and the Intent of our Minds ge∣nerally is, that, when the Period of time, shall be put unto us, and unto our being here, to enjoy a Heavenly Inheritance; I say, I cannot choose but in Charity thus be∣lieve, thus all design undoubtedly, and since the Case is so, that we are design'd one way in our judgments and thoughts, that is at last to obtain Heaven and Happiness, let our Names be what it will, and let your
<PB N="16" REF="003028_0017_0FEFAE806B0E4B08"/>
Forms of Religion be what they will, I make no doubt but this is your design for all. We are all undoubtedly of this Opi∣nion, although I must confess, that various is the judgments of the Children of Men to obtain it. You are sensible Men and Wo∣men, of you, I am speaking to, I make no doubt, and therefore you can assent to what I say in this respect, I make no question at all.</P>
<P>And indeed I must confess to, that it is commendable for all the Children of Men to be thus engaged, considering the sad loss, all of us shall light of that miss this fore∣mentioned Happiness. We are of this Opi∣nion no doubt, and we believe that Woe will be the Portion of those that miss of this end; and therefore it is the wisdom of all the Children of Men, that design to take wise steps to obtain this: for I will tell you Friends, that all that have had experience in this Travail, and all that are Witnesses, and all that have had any assurance of a better World, they have had no small exercise here; it has been a narrow Path though all have travail'd in it, that have come to any assu∣rance of this glorious inheritance. And therefore I would have us be engaged in this as much as in us lies.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="003028_0018_0FEFAE8538FDEB88"/>On the other hand, though we cannot see alike in sundrys, and agree in sundrys, yet for all that we may dare to maintain Cha∣rity unto one another, so far as truth will allow. I can truly say, I envy no Man that cannot see as I do, I pity all that I see out of the way, and my Soul mourns many times for them, I am far from having any bitter spirit against any Man, for since the Case is so to all that miss this way, it will be enough for them, to miss what they expected in another World: And it is pity, that any should be so malicious, against those that cannot say with them, for they are sensible Men as I said before, and he must have some ground for his Belief. For I must tell you Friends, I don't value that Belief that has no grounds or reasons for it, for I know very well that Men must believe, according to that Belief that is forced into them; for true Belief does arise from the Divine Convictions in the Soul, and from the Divine sight. And therefore it is very hard for Men to bear hard one upon a∣nother, because they cannot see alike, for I am sensible that what most Men have differ'd most about, has been since the want
<PB N="18" REF="003028_0019_0FEFAE86C448E898"/>
of the Spirit, and since the Apostacy, and since the Church has gone away, and since it went into the Wilderness. It has been about light things in themselves, and it has not been about the life of Religion. Ma∣ny have been so zealous as to kill one a∣nother about Religion, and some of them have been only about the outward things in Religion, as you may read in ancient History. You know this very well, and it may be better than I can tell you; yet I have had some considerable share in the Church-History, and I have observed that it has been commonly, that the difference has been about shadows that would not save Men, and that Men might be saved without, and therefore I would descend in∣to a consideration with you now, about these shadows that Men have been so con∣cerned about, and therefore I shall consider the Thirtieth Chapter of <HI>Jeremiah, The Lord saith by the Mouth of his Prophet, behold the day is come saith the Lord, and I will make a new Covenant with the House of Israel, and with the House of Judah, not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers in the Wilderness, which Covenant they broke.</HI>
And here you see what he says, <HI>I will write
<PB N="19" REF="003028_0020_0FEFAE89CF18D288"/>
my Law in their Hearts, and put it in their inward parts.</HI></P>
<P>You are Men that read the holy Scrip∣tures, and what this Covenant is, the Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> tells us, in the 9th. Chapter, which stood only in Meats, and Drinks, and divers Washings, and carnal Ordinan∣ces: And here you see it was a new Cove∣nant that was to be made; the first was that that consisted in the Ten Precepts, written and engraven in Stone, and was carry'd into the Ark in the Wilderness, in that Ark was the first Covenant. It was an external out∣ward Covenant, a Covenant of works, and therefore the Lord saith, <HI>Behold the day is come, and I will make a new Covenant with the House of Israel,</HI> &amp;c. I believe that this was the Gospel Dispensation that was there pointed out in this new Covenant, and I suppose that all agree in this Gospel Day that we are under the Gospel Dispensation. That, that was written and engraven on Stone you see that was done away, there∣fore the first Ministration. But the second was the Ministration of Righteousness, and exceeded the same in glory. Therefore the new Covenant is that I would a little speak
<PB N="20" REF="003028_0021_0FEFAE8D6540DD80"/>
to, that you may know where this must be if ever you are acquainted with it: you must come to this new Covenant and well where is it, the Apostle tells you in the se∣cond Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> and the se∣cond Chapter. He was writing to the Church, and he writes unto them after this manner; <HI>Ye are our Epistle, read and known of all Men,</HI> &amp;c. Not the Tables of Stone as the first Covenant was, but the fleshly Ta∣bles of the Heart, is now I believe this new Dispensation where the Covenant is, for God will write his Law on their Hearts, and they shall not say every one to his Neigh∣bour and to his Brother, <HI>know ye the Lord? for ye shall all know me even from the least unto the greatest, saith the Lord, and I will teach them of my ways.</HI> And here the Lord becomes a Teacher unto his People under the Gospel Dispensation.</P>
<P>But I will return a little again unto, what the Author says unto the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> this first Covenant consisted in divers Meats, and Washings, and carnal Ordinances, that is in carnal Ordinances imposed on the Children of Men, until the time of the Reformation.
<PB N="21" REF="003028_0022_0FEF96F266FE25B0"/>
Well Friends, I believe that the first Cove∣nant in point of Obligation is done away in Christ Jesus. He blotted out the Hand, writing of Ordinances, and he took it out of the way and nail'd it unto his Cross, yea the first Covenant of Ordinances ceased there; for you know that what, is nailed is commonly supposed to be fastned, and to be fixed, and to be designed to stay there. This first Covenant did consist in outward perfor∣mance, but this consists in a more Heavenly and Spiritual substance, for I will tell you Friends, all the Ordinances of God, institu∣ted by God under this first Covenant, were very noble Figures, and Shadows: nay be∣fore the Gospel was preached; by these di∣verse Washings and carnal Ordinances. For I suppose you will confess that there was no Remission of Sin, nor Supplication by these, for the Apostle tells us, <HI>that it was impossible for the blood of Bulls, and Goats, and the ashes of an Heifer to purge away Sin,</HI> there was no Washing by these that were but legal Purifications, they did not wash the Souls of Men, for that was repre∣sented by these outward Signs and Figures under that Dispensation, and therefore I
<PB N="22" REF="003028_0023_0FEFAE8F37F52E18"/>
believe during the time of that legal Dispensation, it was necessary for these things which were a Pattern.</P>
