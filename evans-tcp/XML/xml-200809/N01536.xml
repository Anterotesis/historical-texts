<Q><BIBL><HI>Rom. XIII. 8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Owe no Man any thing, but to Love one another.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was a sad Complaint of Old, up∣braiding a People, who had made an high <HI>Profession</HI> of the true <HI>Religion;</HI> Ezek. V. 7. <HI>You have not done according to the Judgments of the Nations which be round about you.</HI> It seems, other Nations, who had not been so well-instructed as this People, yet had <HI>more Equity</HI> in their Dealings, and were People of <HI>Better Morals,</HI> than these who had been under the Covenant of God.</P>
<P>It has been complained, That tho' the <HI>Re∣ligion</HI> of God, be Professed with an uncom∣mon Show among our selves, yet among us,
<PB N="2" REF="001823_0003_0FB83DE4EAB79BA0"/>there are too often found such <HI>Iniquities</HI> in the Dealings of Men, as are condemned even in the <HI>Judgments of the Nations;</HI> and there are <HI>Better Morals</HI> to be found in Places, which yet may have the Censure of the Patriarch upon <HI>Gerar</HI> too much belonging to them, than some∣times occur in what makes the most flourish∣ing Pretences to be a <HI>Land of Rectitude.</HI></P>
<P>But, I hope, it will never be complained, That the Ministers of the Gospel, are by any Sinful Silence accessary to the Transgressions, which <HI>Deny</HI> the <HI>Doctrine of God our Saviour,</HI> a∣mong a People, that are under peculiar Ob∣ligations to <HI>Adorn</HI> it. It shall not be com∣plained, That the Ministers do so confine themselves to Preach <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> that the People forget <HI>Moral Honesty,</HI> thro' any Default of ours. It shall be asserted, That with a due <HI>Frequency,</HI> as well as <HI>Fervency,</HI> we inculcate upon our Neighbours, the Duties of <HI>Moral Honesty,</HI> and remonstrate unto them, that without <HI>This,</HI> all their <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance</HI> is but a <HI>Counterfeit; God will reject it, and they shall not prosper in it!</HI></P>
<P>One <HI>Point of Morality,</HI> wherein we are told, that many People are defective, is, The Cau∣tion with which Peoples <HI>Running into Debt,</HI> and <HI>Lying</HI> in it when they have run into it, ought for ever to be regulated. People there
<PB N="3" REF="001823_0004_0FB83DE85CC8B2B8"/>are, too many, who do bring <HI>Debts</HI> upon themselves, in such a manner, and in such a measure, that a <HI>Folly</HI> nothing short of <HI>Criminal,</HI> is to be charged upon them. And when they have brought such <HI>Debts</HI> upon themselves, their <HI>Delay</HI> to get from under them, is what also amounts unto a <HI>Crime,</HI> for which they are to be Indicted, as <HI>not having the Fear of God before their Eyes.</HI> There are some Circum∣stances of the Day, which may render a Dis∣course on this <HI>Point of Morality,</HI> singularly Sea∣sonable. But indeed it were never out of Sea∣son. And, I would humbly hope, that not only the <HI>Creditors,</HI> but even the <HI>Debtors</HI> too, will anon be Thankful, for the Advice which is now Faithfully to be dispensed unto them.</P>
<P>To check the Errors too often committed by <HI>Contracting</HI> of <HI>Debts,</HI> and by <HI>Continuing</HI> in them, I now read unto you a Sentence of the Sacred Oracles, before which we ought all to tremble as before the Vibrations of a Thunder∣bolt. It is the <HI>Voice of the ETERNAL,</HI> that is now convey'd unto us, by the Pen of an Inspired Apostle. <HI>The God of Glory Thunders</HI> in it; May His <HI>Voice</HI> be so <HI>Powerful,</HI> as to pro∣duce an universal Compliance among us, an universal Obedience unto it.</P>
<P>The Spirit of God, who is a <HI>Righteous Lord,</HI> and <HI>Loves Righteousness,</HI> does first of all direct
<PB N="4" REF="001823_0005_0FB83DEA35E4A950"/>us, to pay a <HI>Debt</HI> which People owe unto their <HI>Superiours;</HI> That they who serve the <HI>Publick,</HI> and have their <HI>Thought</HI> and their <HI>Time</HI> taken up, in watching for the Safety of the <HI>People,</HI> may be handsomely Subsisted in their Station. A <HI>Debt</HI> this is, which is not always duely con∣sidered, nor so honestly paid as it ought to be! But then, the Direction goes on; That what∣ever <HI>Debt</HI> People may owe to <HI>one another,</HI> in the way of their Dealing with <HI>one another,</HI> be al∣so duely answered. People must not be in <HI>Debt</HI> unto one another, any further than what is <HI>anovoidable.</HI> 'Tis true, there is One <HI>Debt,</HI> which tho' it should be ever <HI>Paying,</HI> yet it will be ever <HI>Owing.</HI> A <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> to one ano∣ther. Of this, as <HI>much as you please!</HI> But for any other <HI>Debt,</HI> even for that which is a proper <HI>Debt,</HI> Here you cannot be too Cautious. Let Christians <HI>come Slowly</HI> into it; and let them <HI>get Quickly</HI> out of it. Let Christians Exercise their <HI>Wisdom</HI> in coming in, and their <HI>Justice</HI> in getting out. Come into it, with the Pace of a <HI>Tortoise,</HI> and get out of it, with the Flight of an <HI>Eagle.</HI></P>
<P>The DOCTRINE, which I have a suffici∣ent Commission to insist upon, is this.</P>
<P><HI>There is a proper Caution, about coming into DEBT, and getting out of DERT, which is a considerable Point of Christianity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001823_0006_0FB83DEBB6F8EBF8"/>
A Due <HI>Caution,</HI> to <HI>Owe no Man any thing,</HI> is what <HI>every Man</HI> should Labour in. 'Tis the Duty of Christians, to have as few <HI>Creditors</HI> as ever they can, and owe as little to their <HI>Cre∣ditors</HI> as ever they can, and give none of their <HI>Creditors</HI> any cause to complain, <HI>That they are not fairly dealt withal.</HI></P>
<P>I suppose, There is no need of any Accu∣rate Essay, to give a Definition of the DEBT, against which we are now to be caution'd. The <HI>Lexicons</HI> of the <HI>Lawyers</HI> are needless to be consulted on this Occasion, which will tell us, <HI>Debitor tuus est, qui tibi non reddit quod tuum est.</HI> A <HI>Debtor</HI> is One, who does not let another Man have his own; One who does not ren∣der to a Neighbour, what he has a claim un∣to. They will tell us, A Debt, is what a Man is under Obligation to accommodate another Man withal. Or, <HI>Quod ab Invito Exigi potest;</HI> What a Man may by <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Right,</HI> be forced whether he will or no, to part withal. The meaning of a DEBT, is too well known, yea, on both sides too <HI>feelingly understood,</HI> for us to want any Explication of it. Every body knows, That a Man is in <HI>Debt,</HI> when he is <HI>under Obligation to deliver up any Possessions unto another Man, upon the Demand thereof.</HI> There are many Ways, in which a Man may come under such an Obligation; and particularly
<PB N="6" REF="001823_0007_0FB83DED2E423190"/>such Ways as those wherein <HI>Onesimus</HI> came in <HI>Debt</HI> unto his Master. But the most usual Way, and that which I have now my Eye most upon, is, that of <HI>Agreement with the Cre∣ditor.</HI> The <HI>Debt</HI> is indeed, but as an <HI>Embryo,</HI> in its Formation, while the <HI>Time</HI> is not yet come for the Creditor to make his Demand. But it is more fully formed, and makes a ve∣ry audible Cry, when a Man witholds from another Man, the <HI>Possessions,</HI> which ought <HI>Now</HI> to be delivered. This is not only <HI>Being</HI> in <HI>Debt,</HI> but also <HI>Lying</HI> in <HI>Debt:</HI> And it is to be a∣voided with all the <HI>Caution</HI> imaginable. <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI> You do not answer your <HI>Worthy Name;</HI> nor come up to that Necessary Character of <HI>True</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Genuine Christians,</HI> Heb XIII. 18. <HI>Having a Good Conscience, in all things willing to Live Honestly;</HI>—If this <HI>Caution</HI> be a Stran∣ger with you.</P>
<P>I hope, no Man will Excuse any Mans not <HI>Paying</HI> what he <HI>Owes,</HI> by the Example of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> who <HI>Borrowed</HI> of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> with∣out making any Restitution. If the Great GOD, who was now become the King of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> gave His injur'd People a sort of <HI>Letters of Mart,</HI> for them to make Reprisals on the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> it was but according to the <HI>Law of Nations.</HI> But some will maintain, in reali∣ty, the <HI>Israelites</HI> did not <HI>Borrow</HI> any thing of
<PB N="7" REF="001823_0008_0FB83DEEB1E06EC0"/>the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> Our Translation may be mend∣ed. They did not <HI>Borrow,</HI> but <HI>Beg</HI> of them. The same Word is Translated elsewhere, To <HI>Request.</HI> The Things which the <HI>Israelites</HI> had of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> were not <HI>Lent,</HI> but <HI>Given</HI> to them. When its said, <HI>They Lent unto them,</HI> it should be only taken so, <HI>They Accommodated them.</HI></P>
<P>I am aware, That for People to bring them∣selves into <HI>Debt,</HI> is not a Thing always For∣bidden of God Our Apostle himself, who writes to the <HI>Romans, Owe no Man any thing,</HI> yet was willing to bring himself into <HI>Debt,</HI> upon a Good Occasion Yea, and into a <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Suretiship</HI> too, which is a Sort of <HI>Debt,</HI> that calls for more <HI>Caution</HI> than any in the World. On the behalf of his Convert, he writes unto <HI>Philemon;</HI> (Ver. 8.) <HI>If he owes thee any thing, put that on mine Account.</HI> It was of Old required by God; Deut. XV. 8 <HI>If there be a poor Man, thou shalt surely lend him sufficient for his Need.</HI> Our Saviour has Commanded us. To <HI>Lend</HI> one unto another; Saying, <HI>From him that would Borrow of thee, turn thou not away.</HI> And in His Word, He has Commended, the <HI>Good Man, that Shows Favour and Lendeth;</HI> with an Hint indeed at the same time, <HI>That we should guide our Affairs with Discretion.</HI> But we can't <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> without our Neighbour coming into <HI>Debt</HI> unto us: Which renders it plain. That
<PB N="8" REF="001823_0009_0FB83DF3A4002408"/>some <HI>Debt</HI> is to be allowed of. Yea, without some <HI>Debt,</HI> there could no <HI>Trade</HI> be carried on. It would strangely Cramp the <HI>Trade</HI> of a Peo∣ple, if it might be no more than the <HI>Cash</HI> that is running among them. There may be much <HI>Conveniency</HI> in <HI>Buying,</HI> and sometimes there may be a <HI>Necessity</HI> for <HI>Buying,</HI> when People cannot immediately <HI>Pay</HI> for what they <HI>Buy.</HI> Yea, since the World so much resolves to <HI>Trade upon Credit,</HI> I will Grant, That a Man of <HI>Capacity</HI> and <HI>Integrity,</HI> that has nothing else, may some∣times have his <HI>Capacity</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI> a <HI>Sufficient Fund,</HI> for him to take up thereupon, if his <HI>Cre∣ditors</HI> will please to have it so. Our <HI>Books of Accounts,</HI> are a very Material part of our <HI>Libra∣ries;</HI> and an Excellent Provision they are, to carry on a <HI>Lucriferous Business,</HI> when 'tis impossi∣ble to have <HI>Cash</HI> at hand, in Proportion to the <HI>Trade</HI> that mult be prosecuted. And there, if <HI>Discount</HI> pass for <HI>Good Pay,</HI> I pray, what Hurt is done to any Body? No Body is hurt, if the <HI>Debt</HI> wherewith <HI>Trade</HI> is carryed on, be kept under a <HI>Suitable Regulation.</HI></P>
<P>But, that <HI>Suitable Regulation!</HI> This is what I am now to treat upon.</P>
<P>I Confess my self less competent for a Trea∣tise on such a Subject, than perhaps many o∣thers in the Auditory, For, <HI>I am neither a Tra∣der, nor the Son of a Trader.</HI> And yet I am a
<PB N="9" REF="001823_0010_0FB83DF570DA0EC8"/>Master of certain MAXIMS, which will En∣able me &amp; Embolden me, to attempt now a very brief Treatise upon it. MAXIMS which I can maintain with Victorious Demonstrations, and have more than a <HI>Thousand Preachers</HI> in the Au∣ditory, to stand by me; I mean, The CON∣SCIENCE of every Man that I Speak unto; MAXIMS, which if well hearken'd to, ther would be fewer of those <HI>Debts,</HI> which multiply among us <HI>Uneasy Circumstances;</HI> and this Place would be much more, <HI>A Mountain of Holiness, and a Dwelling of Righteousness,</HI> and so the <HI>Blessed of the Lord.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="maxim">
<HEAD>The first MAXIM.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A Man that is going into Debt, should keep the Eye of Prudence Open, upon every Step that is before him.</HI> To run in the <HI>Dark,</HI> when One is going into <HI>Debt;</HI> This is <HI>Folly in the Exaltation of it:</HI> One going into <HI>Debt,</HI> should with a <HI>Rational Prospect,</HI> be able to see his <HI>whole way Plain</HI> be∣fore him. People without <HI>Foresight</HI> should ne∣ver go into <HI>Debt;</HI> without <HI>Foresight,</HI> of what in the Progress of their way they may meet withal. It was an ancient Prayer; Psal. V. 8. <HI>Because of my Observers, make thy way strait be∣fore my Face.</HI> My Friend, Because of thy <HI>Cre∣ditors,</HI> Be sure of a <HI>Strait way,</HI> and go not into <HI>Debt,</HI> without a <HI>Way</HI> lying Plain <HI>before thy Face,</HI> for every step of thy Motions. The Jews have
<PB N="10" REF="001823_0011_0FB83DF6EDA4D080"/>a Tradition, that our Father <HI>Adam</HI> was the Author of that Saying, <HI>No Man would Sin if he saw from the Beginning to the End.</HI> Most cer∣tainly very many among the Children of <HI>Adam,</HI> would not run into <HI>Debt,</HI> as they do, if they did but <HI>see from the Beginning to the End.</HI> Going into <HI>Debt,</HI> make a Pause, and think, <HI>Will it not be Bitterness in the Latter End?</HI> The conduct of <HI>Prudence,</HI> is that; Prov. XX<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <HI>A Prudent Man foresees the Evil and hides himself.</HI> Sirs, When you are going into <HI>Debt,</HI> thoroughly weigh the Matter. If you can <HI>foresee</HI> any remarkable <HI>Evil,</HI> in which you are like to be Entangled by what you do; <HI>Then</HI> Stop; <HI>then</HI> stay; <HI>then</HI> look about you. If you are So <HI>Simple,</HI> as to <HI>pass on,</HI> you deserve to be <HI>Punished</HI> for what you do. The Thing I press for is, That before you go into <HI>Debt,</HI> you advise with an Ingenious Man that once prevented a deal of Mischief at <HI>Ephesus;</HI> I mean him, who did a World of Good by that Memorable Saying, <HI>Ye ought to do nothing Rashly.</HI> When the <HI>Temptation</HI> of going into <HI>Debt</HI> comes upon you, [And, there often appears too much cause to Justify my Term, when I call it, <HI>of Temptation!</HI>] it will be but <HI>Prudently</HI> done of you, to think; <HI>What will be the Consequence of what I am now a doing? Shall not I run my self into inextricable Snares? Am not I pulling on my self insupportable Miseries? Cares
<PB N="11" REF="001823_0012_0FB83DFA6A593B78"/>that will be too heavy for me? Cheats upon those have trusted me? The wrath of disappoinied Cre∣ditors? Disgrace &amp; Contempt among all my Neigh∣bours?</HI> If upon Mature Deliberation, you have a <HI>Clear View</HI> of Escaping all this <HI>Evil;</HI> Then 'tis <HI>Well!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Prudence</HI> is the Thing that is urged upon you. Now, that you may keep within the Limits of <HI>Prudence,</HI> Methinks, it were no im∣proper Proposal; <HI>Consult with a Prudent Friend, about what you do, before you do it.</HI> A <HI>Friend</HI> whose <HI>Prudence</HI> you may rely much upon; Such a <HI>Friend</HI> is a <HI>Treasure.</HI> And on this Oc∣casion, he may be very <HI>Literally</HI> so, <HI>Emphati∣cally</HI> so! If you have any <HI>Doubt,</HI> about going into any <HI>Debt;</HI> Ask the Counsil of such a <HI>Friend,</HI> Whether it be well for you to do it, or no? You know who said; Prov. XIII. 10. <HI>With the Well-advised is Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>I am sure, if you Consult with one Friend, whom I shall Name unto you he will give you a Dictate of <HI>Prudence,</HI> about one Sort of <HI>Debt,</HI> where with many Thousands do most <HI>Unadvi∣sedly</HI> ruine themselves, and their Families. A <HI>Solomon</HI> is the Friend, I intend; and the <HI>Debt</HI> is that of an Inconsiderate <HI>Suretiship,</HI> an Un∣reasonable <HI>Suretiship.</HI> He tells us; Prov. XVII. 18. <HI>A Man void of Understanding striketh hands, and becomes a Surety in the presence of his
<PB N="12" REF="001823_0013_0FB83DFB75339548"/>Friend.</HI> He tells us; Prov. XI. 15. <HI>He that is Surety for a Stranger shall be sore Broken for it; and he that hateth Suretiship is sure.</HI> For a Man to Vow, <HI>That he will never be Surety for another,</HI> 'tis to make a <HI>Rash Vow.</HI> A Man may thus Ensnare himself in Engagements to decline a <HI>Duty</HI> which God may call him to. There is a Violation of the <HI>Third Commandment,</HI> as well as Breach upon <HI>Charity,</HI> in such Engagements. But then, If you will be <HI>well-advisea,</HI> forget not that Caveat; Prov. XXII. 26. <HI>Be not One of them that are Sureties for Debts.</HI> Use abundance of Deliberation, when a <HI>Suretiship</HI> shall be pro∣pounded unto you; Think over &amp; over again; <HI>Am I Safe? Does God call me into any Sponsorial Hazards? Do not the Circumstancies of my Family forbid my coming into them? Shall not I by'nd by Repent most bitterly, and even tear my Hair for the Vexation of my coming under these Encumbrances?</HI> These are Thoughts, which I suppose, do not come into the Minds of them, who are most easily drawn into <HI>Ruining Suretiships.</HI> The <HI>Cups</HI> that sometimes Mellow Men into this <HI>Folly,</HI> don't afford Room for such Thoughts as these.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="maxim">
<HEAD>The Second MAXIM.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A Man that would not be Sinfully in Debt ought to have a Spirit reconciled unto a Low and Mean Condition in the World, if this be what the Glorious GOD shall call him to.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="001823_0014_0FB83DFD088F1DC8"/>
A grand Cause of Peoples running into <HI>Debt,</HI> is this; They cannot bear the Humilia∣tions of a <HI>Low and a Mean Condition</HI> in the World. Especially, They that have sometimes Lived in more of Splendor; these oftentimes find themselves very unable to bear a <HI>Reduced Condition.</HI> This 'tis, that causes them to run into <HI>Debt.</HI> for the Supply of their <HI>Carnal Appe∣tites.</HI> Hence 'tis, that Some who <HI>Live upon other Mens Estates,</HI> go so far in their Extrava∣gancy, as to Live Higher than their <HI>Creditors</HI> themselves can do. Those <HI>Flags of Pride,</HI> if I may be so bold, <HI>Are they Paid for?</HI> With what Face can you pretend unto them, while they are not so?</P>
<P>But, first, it is a Position, which I hope, no Good Man will question; If a Man cannot keep out of a <HI>Low and Mean Condition,</HI> without a plain <HI>wrong to the Estates of other Men,</HI> he is then most Evidently called of GOD into a <HI>Low and Mean Condition.</HI> Man, The Glorious GOD, <HI>whose thou art, and whose are all thy wayes,</HI> now Stakes thee down to a <HI>Low and Mean Con∣dition.</HI> Thy <HI>Straits</HI> are what the Glorious GOD has ordered for thee. It should be a Principle with a Good Man, <HI>I may not have, what I cannot have.</HI> And in Pursuance of this Principle he should go on; <HI>I cannot have what it will be a wrong unto other People for me to have.</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="001823_0015_0FB83E02257D03F0"/>The short of it is; <HI>If there be any thing that I cannot have without forcing and keeping my Neigh∣bour out of his Right for it, the Great GOD Or∣ders me to go without it.</HI></P>
<P>Well; but what shall we then do, if a Con∣dition of such <HI>Creepling Circumstances</HI> be ordered for us?</P>
<P>The Answer is, <HI>Lower your Sails.</HI> For there is another Position, of which I am sure no Good Man will make any Question. If GOD consine a Man unto <HI>a Low and Mean Condition,</HI> the Man should Labour for a sweet <HI>Contentment</HI> with his <HI>Low and Mean Condition. Confinement</HI> and <HI>Contentment</HI> must go together. <HI>You have not forgotten the Exhortation that speaketh unto you, Be Content with such Things as you have.</HI> Let a Man get a <HI>Spirit</HI> suited unto his <HI>Condition.</HI> It is the First mark of Blessedness; Mat. V. 3. <HI>Blessed are the Poor in Spirit.</HI> Who are the <HI>Poor in Spirit?</HI> They that have a <HI>Spirit</HI> willing to be <HI>Peor</HI> if God call them to it. It is injoined upon you; Jam. I. 10. <HI>Let the rich rejoyce in that he is made low.</HI> How shall he <HI>Rejoyce in being made Low?</HI> Let him cheerfully entertain the Opportunities which his being <HI>made Low,</HI> and falling into Decay, gives him to express his Patience, his Humility, his Resignation, and Glorify God. A <HI>Low and a Mean Condition</HI> is perhaps, the <HI>Cross</HI> which our Saviour has
<PB N="15" REF="001823_0016_0FB83E02F7AE2E50"/>assigned unto us; <HI>The Thing appointed for us.</HI> It becomes us now to be <HI>Crucify'd unto the Would:</HI> A Man upon a <HI>Cross</HI> troubles not himself a∣bout the <HI>Wealth</HI> of this World. Remember, Sirs, It won't be long that you are to languish in this <HI>Low and Mean Condition.</HI> The Prophet said, Ezek. VII. 12. <HI>The Day draweth near, let not the seller mourn.</HI> Since the <HI>Day draweth near,</HI> that you are to be Stript of all, don't lay it much to Heart, tho' you must <HI>Sell</HI> all you have, and Strip your selves of every thing, rather than ly in <HI>Debt</HI> for what you have.</P>

<P><HI>Men ought often and nicely to Examine the State of their Business, if they would not find themselves irrecoverably Plunged into Debt, before they are aware, but it comes in unexpectedly like a Traveller upon them; and then holds him like an Armed Man.</HI></P>
<P>It is a very Dangerous, and therefore a very <HI>Culpable</HI> Thing, for People to let their <HI>Business</HI> go on from Year to Year, in Muddy <HI>Uncertain∣ties.</HI> There are no wise People, but what will be fond of often seeing <HI>Where-abouts</HI> they are in their <HI>Business.</HI> It was directed; Prov. XXVII. 23. <HI>Be thou diligent to know the state of thy Flocks, and look well to thy Herds; For Riches are not for ever.</HI> People should use much <HI>Diligence,</HI> frequent En∣quiry, exact Inspection, into the <HI>State</HI> of their
<PB N="17" REF="001823_0018_0FB83E099C182768"/>Affairs.

<P>But, if upon the Scrutiny, Men find, That they <HI>Over-trade their Stock;</HI> and if they find, That they <HI>run behind hand;</HI> Or, in a word, if they find, that their <HI>Expences</HI> do exceed their <HI>Revenues;</HI> They ought <HI>Seasonably,</HI> I say, <HI>Seaso∣nably,</HI> to take all due Measures, and <HI>Early</HI> E∣nough, put a Stop to the Torrent of <HI>Debt,</HI> which else like Waters at a Breach, is breaking in upon them.</P>
<P>Upon this Head, I have One Thing more to say; which I suppose all that would lead <HI>Lives in all Godliness &amp; Honesty,</HI> will Justify.

<P><HI>The Man that is got into Debt, ought to get out of it, as fast as be can, and as if it were for his Life.</HI></P>
<P>Unto a Man that is fallen into the Toils of <HI>Debt,</HI> there is this Advice given; Prov. VI. 5. <HI>Deliver thy self as a Roe from the hand of the Hun∣ter, and as a Bird from the hand of the Fowler.</HI> What is a <HI>Debt,</HI> but a <HI>Load:</HI> An honest Man should feel it as a <HI>Load,</HI> and groan under the <HI>Load;</HI> But not cry for, <HI>more Weight!</HI>—as the Miserables that are <HI>Pressing to Death</HI> use to do. He that is in <HI>Debt,</HI> should be in <HI>Pain,</HI> to get out of it. Especially, if the <HI>Time</HI> when the <HI>Payment</HI> becomes due, be arrived, it should be like the <HI>Pain</HI> of a <HI>Broken Bone</HI> unto him. For indeed, it is a very true Assertion; <HI>Minus Sol∣vit qui minus tempore Solvit;</HI> A Man does not Pay the <HI>Sum,</HI> if he don't pay it in the <HI>Time</HI> that is agreed for. <HI>Debtor,</HI> Be thou so Solicitous in <HI>Complying with Time</HI> for every Payment; and be so Indefatigable in turning every Stone for the Satisfaction of thy <HI>Creditor,</HI> that he may have no manner of reason to Reproach thee, for
<PB N="19" REF="001823_0020_0FB83E0D59356A38"/>any <HI>Carelessness,</HI> and <HI>Slothfulness,</HI> any Tendency to the least <HI>Appearance of Evil</HI> in thee. And here occurs one thing to be more particular∣ly animadverted on. When a <HI>Poor Man</HI> has done any Work for a <HI>Rich Man,</HI> whom he has much dependance on, and he comes for his Dues; the <HI>Rich</HI> ought not now to <HI>answer him roughly,</HI> and put him off time after time, and make him Lose, I know not how much Time, in giving Attendance on him. <HI>Detained Wages</HI> will anon make a Cry that will reach the Hea∣vens. 'Tis Enjoined, Prov. III. 28. <HI>Say not unto thy Neighbour, go and come again, and to mor∣row I will give, when thou hast it by thee.</HI></P>

<P><HI>If a Man be so far brought into Debt, as to be∣come Insolvent, there is a Behaviour agreable to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Holy Religion, both by God and Men to be expected from him.</HI></P>
<P>Let our <HI>Debtors</HI> pay some Regard unto the <HI>Admonition of God our Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>If it be thro' any <HI>Real Default of yours,</HI> that such a <HI>Debt</HI> be come upon you. 'tis most cer∣tain, you ought with a deep <HI>Repentance,</HI> to a∣base your selves before God, and the World. Your Acknowledgments unto your <HI>Creditors</HI> particularly, ought to have such a sensible, and Ingenuous, and self abusing <HI>Repentance</HI> in them, that <HI>their</HI> Hearts towards you may be
<PB N="20" REF="001823_0021_0FB83E0E38663798"/><HI>mollified,</HI> by their seeing the <HI>Brokenness</HI> of <HI>yours.</HI> It is prescribed unto one in <HI>Debt;</HI> Prov. VI. 3. <HI>Do tois now, my son: when thou art come into the hand of thy Friend, Go humble thy self.</HI></P>
<P>But if it be the <HI>meer Hand of God</HI> that has by Impoverishing <HI>Losses</HI> brought this <HI>Debt</HI> upon you, still there is very much <HI>Self-Abasement</HI> cal∣led for. 'Tis a <HI>Rebuke</HI> of God upon you, that has thus <HI>Emptied</HI> you, and <HI>Enfeebled</HI> you; And a very <HI>Humbling Rebuke</HI> it is. Under it, you ought to be so Humble, so Modest, so Pensive, and so Submissive, that your <HI>Creditors</HI> as well as other Spectators, instead of Upbraiding you and Insulting you, shall but <HI>Sympathize</HI> with you in the Disasters that have befallen you. The Exhortation to such as are thrown into <HI>Debt,</HI> is that; 1 Pet. V. 6. <HI>Humble your selves under the mighty Hand of God, that he may Exalt you in due time.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Fine,</HI> Let the <HI>Debt</HI> come which way it will, your <HI>Creditors</HI> must be fairly dealt withal. An Insolvency must not be complicated with any <HI>Under-hand Practices,</HI> any <HI>Fraudulent Practices,</HI> a∣ny Unjust <HI>Concealments,</HI> that shall <HI>withold more than is meet,</HI> from the Injured <HI>Creditors.</HI> There was a Poor Widow, very much in <HI>Debt;</HI> But she was one who discovered a very <HI>Honest Mind</HI> that the <HI>Creditors</HI> might be satisfy'd. God strangely enabled her to satisfy them; Yea,
<PB N="21" REF="001823_0022_0FB83E0FAF335408"/>but see how the Direction ran, 2 King. IV. 7. <HI>Go, and pay thy Debt, and live thou and thy Chil∣dren of the rest.</HI> The First Thing to be look'd after was, <HI>Go and pay thy Debt;</HI> And, Rely up∣on the Providence of God for the reft. There have been some <HI>Debtors,</HI> who have taken such <HI>Indirect Methods</HI> upon an Insolvency, that a per∣petual Series of Disappointments has after∣wards been Entail'd upon them; Nothing would ever after stick upon their Bread; The Doom from the Throne of God upon them, has been that; Jer.

<HEAD>The Seventh MAXIM.</HEAD>
<P>A Wholesome Antidote against the Mischiefs of Debt, it would be for a Man to Consider Seriously what he does, when he wrongs other Men by lying in Debt unto them.</P>
<P>CONSIDERATION: O thou <HI>Preservative</HI> of Mankind. A wake thou, Arise, Affect, and mightily go to Work, on the Occasion that is now before us.</P>
<P>First, A <HI>Debtor,</HI> (one that is, or would be so) will do well to Consider, how much he may be Condemned by that <HI>Royal Law; Let a Man do as be would be done unto.</HI> The Law that shines as a Star of the First Magnitude, in the Scrip∣tures of our Saviour; Mat. VII. 12. <HI>All things whatsoever ye would, that men should do to you, do
<PB N="22" REF="001823_0023_0FB83E1145964470"/>ye even so to them.</HI> A Law, which God has En∣graven as with a <HI>Pen of Iron, and the Point of a Diamond,</HI> on the Hearts of the Children of Men. A Law, than which none more <HI>Confessed,</HI> and yet none more <HI>Transgressed</HI> among the Chil∣dren of Men. <HI>Debtor,</HI> Think with thy self, <HI>Were I the Creditor, should I like to be dealt withal as I now deal with my Creditor?</HI></P>
<P>I now make a <HI>Motion</HI> that is full of <HI>Equity;</HI> And if this Our <HI>Motion</HI> may more generally take, my <HI>Sermon</HI> will have a very Desirable &amp; Comfortable <HI>Harvest,</HI> tho' all the rest of it should be but as the Rain falling upon a Rock. 'Tis this; When the <HI>Debtor</HI> puts off his <HI>Creditor</HI> from time to time, Let him think with him∣self; <HI>Were I the Creditor, could I care or bear to be so deals withal?</HI> How many <HI>Shufflings,</HI> would such a Thought as this in the Power of it, put an end unto?</P>
<P>Again, A <HI>Debtor</HI> will do well to <HI>Consider,</HI> what is the <HI>Eighth Commandment;</HI> What is implied in it; What is Required in it; And how far the <HI>Eighth Commandment</HI> will bear him out. Cer∣tainly, To keep a Man out of his <HI>Right,</HI> when 'tis possible to help him to it; I may use those Words upon it, Job XXXV. 2. <HI>Thinkest then this to be Right?</HI> The <HI>Eighth Commandment</HI> will never consent unto it.</P>
<P>This is the rather to be spoken, because
<PB N="23" REF="001823_0024_0FB83E15323AB038"/>very many of the <HI>Debts</HI> in the World, are per∣fect <HI>Thefts,</HI> cursed <HI>Thefts.</HI> And the <HI>Flying Roll</HI> that is to <HI>Enter into the House of the Thief,</HI> will find the way to those that make nothing of them.</P>
<P>Once more; The <HI>Miscries</HI> which <HI>Debt</HI> is ac∣companied withal; ought not these also to be Considered? Oh! <HI>Cotisider</HI> of it. Is it nothing, to be in such continual <HI>Perplexities,</HI> that One must conclude a <HI>Pillow</HI> to have Some uncom∣mon Stuffing in it, that so <HI>Perplexed</HI> a Man should be able to <HI>Sleep</HI> upon it? Is it nothing, to be Despised of ones Neighbour, and be annihila∣ted with a blasted Reputation? Is it nothing, to be exposed unto the Rage, of Provoked <HI>Cre∣ditors,</HI> &amp; feel many Effects of their Indignation? To be <HI>Dun'd</HI> with repeated Indignities; To be <HI>Vex'd</HI> with legal Prosecutions; At length to have that Story come in for the iffue of all; Marth. XVIII 28 <HI>The Creditor laid hands on him; &amp; tool him by the Throat, saying, Pay me what thou owest. And he cast him into Prison, till he should pay the Debt.</HI> Oh! Miserable Case! It is mention'd as the Lamentable case of <HI>Davids</HI> Followers; 1 Sam. XXII. 2. <HI>Every one that was in Distress, and every one that was in Debt.</HI> Verily, Tis <HI>Distress</HI> enough to be in <HI>Debt;</HI> Enough to Pall &amp; Spoil all the Delights of a Man that has any Ingennicy What? For him on every Turn to think, <HI>There we such and such Good Neighbours. that Suffer no
<PB N="24" REF="001823_0025_0FB83E1708E46DA0"/>little Damage from me!</HI> How much Regret in a Reflection on it!</P>
<P>For indeed, There is this in it, worse than all the rest. Oftentimes a Man in <HI>Debt,</HI> must have the <HI>Guilt</HI> of much <HI>Wrong</HI> lying upon him. This <HI>Guilt</HI> will bring a Cloud upon the Soul, be <HI>Chains of Darkness</HI> upon it, and much interrupt Communion with God. Yea, the <HI>Guilt</HI> will arm the <HI>Conscience</HI> with Scourges grievously to lash the Soul that shall be under it. In Anti∣quity we find many Customes, of Severe Punish∣ments inflicted by <HI>Creditors</HI> on their <HI>Debtors</HI> when in a course of Law, they had them delivered up unto them. <HI>A. Gellius</HI> among others makes a mention of them. What the Roman Laws of the XII <HI>Tables</HI> allow'd, for the <HI>Creditors</HI> to tear the <HI>Debtors</HI> Limb from Limb without a Metaphor, was hard enough. But for the <HI>Con∣science</HI> of a <HI>Debtor</HI> to take him in hand, and with angry Strokes to tell him, <HI>You have wronged such &amp; such Neighbours; they feel themselves the worse for you every day that comes over their heads; and what Restitution can you make unto them!</HI> Verily, This will be worse than any of the ancient <HI>Punishments,</HI> that <HI>Bankrupts</HI> had assigned for them. I say, Again &amp; again, <HI>Consider</HI> of it!</P>
<P>And now, having built a <HI>Watch-Tower</HI> upon <HI>Seven</HI> MAXIMS, as upon so many Unshaken <HI>Pillars,</HI> from whence you have dispensed unto
<PB N="25" REF="001823_0026_0FB83E18B62FB828"/>you those <HI>Warnings,</HI> which may prevent the <HI>Debts,</HI> wherein too many <HI>detain</HI> the Possessions of their Neighbours, without the <HI>Consent,</HI> &amp; unto the <HI>Damage,</HI> of the Rightful Owners; I think, I have Purchased the Liberty to address the <HI>Cre∣ditors</HI> a little in Favour of their <HI>Debtors,</HI> and En∣treat that as much <HI>Favour</HI> as can be, may be shown unto them. Sir, It may be your Poor <HI>Debtors,</HI> come to you after that manner; Matth. XVIII 29 <HI>He fell down at his Feet, &amp; besought him, saying, Have Patience with me, &amp; I will pay thee all.</HI> Now, if these <HI>Debtors</HI> give you any Indications of an <HI>Honest Mind,</HI> I also Pray you, to have as much <HI>Patience</HI> with them as you can. I have not a word to say, against <HI>Compelling</HI> of People to be <HI>Honest.</HI> But if you see, they would fain be <HI>Honest,</HI> &amp; Struggle &amp; Wrestle for it, and have any Merit in them, then, I say, use them with all the <HI>Goodness</HI> &amp; <HI>Mercy</HI> of a Brother; Let them find all <HI>Brotherly Kindness</HI> from you. You have them in <HI>Debt</HI> unto you, for so much <HI>Money;</HI> Bring them into a further <HI>Debt,</HI> for so much <HI>Kind Usage</HI> of them; Tho' on this head, Let them stand charged for nothing, but, <HI>Love to a Benefactor.</HI></P>
<P>It pleases me very much to find this prescri∣bed in a famous <HI>Lexicon Juridicum;</HI> <Q>That before a <HI>Debtor</HI> be Sued, <HI>Adeundus est, et civiliter inter∣pessandus, semel at{que} iterum,</HI> He should be civilly Addiessed once again, by the <HI>Creditor,</HI> &amp; then
<PB N="26" REF="001823_0027_0FB83E1A493EC688"/>by some of his Friends, and be Admonish'd of the Damage that he will bring upon himself, and especially the Wounds upon his <HI>Conscience,</HI> if he don't fairly pay what he owes. [Ac∣cording to, Matth. XVIII. 15, 16.]</Q> <HI>Calvin</HI> the Lawyer, observes, That this way of Admo∣nishing a <HI>Debtor,</HI> before the Arresting of him, <HI>Certum crit, quod ex jure Divino et Humano omnibus modis sit Observanda.</HI> And that there are Places, in which a <HI>Plantiff</HI> cannot have his Cause heard, if he can't prove that he has used the <HI>Urbanity,</HI> of these Preliminary <HI>Admonitions.</HI></P>
<P>Doubtless you Observe, That the Precept, <HI>Owe no Man any thing,</HI> has a Twin-Brother born with it; <HI>But to Love one another.</HI> Of this <HI>Debt,</HI> the <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Love,</HI> which we must always <HI>Pay,</HI> and yet alwayes <HI>Owe,</HI> to one another, I cannot but make this Observation. This <HI>Debt</HI> well follow'd, would regulate the other wonderfully! If this MAXIM, <HI>To Love our Neighbours as our selves,</HI> were closely kept to, Things would be carried on between <HI>Creditors</HI> and their <HI>Debtors,</HI> with a most wondrous easiness.</P>
<P>Did Men <HI>Love one another,</HI> they would be loth to be <HI>Debtors,</HI> be <HI>slow to Owe, and swift to Pay;</HI> They would have a mighty Horror of <HI>Owing</HI> more than they can make <HI>Payment</HI> of; They would resolve, <HI>I will undergo any thing, rather than damnify my Neighbour, that lives peaceably &amp; securely by me, &amp; is ready to let me have, what I ask him for,</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="001823_0028_0FB83E1C1BCD5710"/>
Did Men <HI>Love one anotber,</HI> they would not seck to make others become their <HI>Servants,</HI> which you know, <HI>Debtors</HI> are. And where they are so, they would not be <HI>Cruel</HI> in <HI>Exactions</HI> and <HI>Extor∣tions</HI> upon them. No; They would sometimes <HI>Remit</HI> unto the extremely Necessitous, what they might have Exacted &amp; Extorted from them.</P>
<P>I will particularly say, Tho' <HI>Usury</HI> be Lawful in a Country where Lands may be <HI>Mortgaged</HI> and forever <HI>Alienated;</HI> as they might not in the Land of <HI>Israel;</HI> yet there are some Hard Usa∣ges in the <HI>Usury,</HI> between the <HI>Creditor</HI> and the <HI>Debtor</HI> among our selves, which the Law of <HI>Love</HI> will never justify.</P>
<P>And now, the Minds of People throughout the Country, are greatly engaged in <HI>Projections,</HI> how we shall become furnished with such a <HI>Me∣dium</HI> of <HI>Trade,</HI> as may prevent an undue Growth of <HI>Debt</HI> among us, I will take the Opportunity to say; My Brethren, I be seech you, Let not this <HI>Debt</HI> be forgotten, <HI>To Love one another.</HI> There is a <HI>Variety</HI> of Apprehensions upon the matter. This Variety, begins to grow into too much <HI>A∣crimony.</HI> But, <HI>My Brethren These Things ought not so to be.</HI> Your Ministers are too Wife, I hope, to offer you any of their Sentiments upon your Various <HI>Projections.</HI> And they do not count themselves Wise enough, to pronounce any <HI>Judgment</HI> upon that Spirit of <HI>Over-trading</HI> and <HI>Over-doing</HI> that some suppose very much to
<PB N="28" REF="001823_0029_0FB83E1D37E63DE0"/>threaten us. Or Wise enough to propose what <HI>Retrenchments</HI> may be most Expedient for us. But we will all make you an ofter, of what our <HI>Bible</HI> has in it, relating to your Conduct. There we find it said; Jam. IV. 11 <HI>Speak not Evil One of another, Brethren.</HI> There we find it said; Eph. IV. 31. <HI>Let all Bitterness, &amp; Wrath, &amp; Anger, and Clamour, &amp; Evil-speaking be put away from among you.</HI> Sirs, you have a Great Esteem for One another; and they are very worthy Men, who now thwart One another in their Apprehensions. But, Oh! Don't grow <HI>Strange</HI> to One another. If once your Spirits be at all <HI>Exasperated,</HI> the Malady against which we would all provide, will but come under an <HI>Exasperation. Animosities</HI> will make all good <HI>Projections</HI> Impracticable; our Case Deplorable &amp; Incurable. <HI>Consider what I say, &amp; the Lord give you understanding in all things.</HI></P>
<P>But I shall go off in <HI>Debt,</HI> if I leave another Thing Unmentioned. I may not leave off, un∣til I have done my Best, that <HI>every Soul</HI> in the Assembly may have a <HI>Portion</HI> to carry home. It may be some of the Hearers will count them∣selves <HI>Unconcerned,</HI> [tho', <HI>I know not why they should</HI>] in what has been hitherto insisted on. But I am sure, I have now something to say, that <HI>every Soul</HI> in the Assembly has Infinite Cause to give Attention to. The Distinction of a, <HI>Debitor ex contractu;</HI> &amp; a, <HI>Debitor ex delicto,</HI> is to be thought upon; A <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Contract,</HI> &amp; a <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Trespass.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="001823_0030_0FB83E1EB674F6B8"/>
'Tis a Thing that calls for the most awful, Consideration of <HI>Every Soul</HI> among us; That our <HI>Sins</HI> have brought us into <HI>Debt</HI> unto the <HI>Justice</HI> of the Infinte GOD. There is a <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Sufferings,</HI> which we owe to the <HI>Justice</HI> of the In∣finite GOD. The <HI>Fenalty</HI> of the <HI>Divine Law,</HI> to which our Sins have made us obnoxious, must be Executed. The Honour of the <HI>Holy One,</HI> whom we have Denied &amp; Blasphemed by our Sins, must be Vindicated. For the Pay∣ment of this <HI>Debt,</HI> there are <HI>Sufferings</HI> to be en∣dured, which are, Oh! how Exceedingly to be trembled at! Our <HI>Sins</HI> are called, our <HI>Debts,</HI> because they render us fearfully <HI>Indebted</HI> unto the <HI>Justice</HI> of God. Sinner, Thou hast a <HI>Debt</HI> lying upon thee, which were ponderous enough to break the Backs of all the Angels in Heaven. <HI>Ten Thousand Talents</HI> are but a small Denomina∣tion, for the <HI>Debt</HI> which is oppressing of thee; the <HI>Debt,</HI> which may make thee cry out, <HI>Lord, I am oppressed, undertake for me!</HI> Ten Thousand <HI>Mountains</HI> were less than the light Dust of the Balance, compared unto it. <HI>Thousands of Rams, Ten Thousands of Rivers of Oyl;</HI> a Sacrificed Off-spring; a Sacrifice of Myriads of Angels; the whole World made a Sacrisice; all Creatures turn'd into a <HI>Burnt-Offering,</HI> would not make a full Payment of the <HI>Debt.</HI></P>
<P>But, Oh! What an astonishing thing has been done for us on this tremendous Occasion! The Eternal
<PB N="30" REF="001823_0031_0FB83E20F62A3DD0"/>Son of God has assumed our <HI>Nature;</HI> and therein He has become our <HI>Surety.</HI> On a Compact with His Glo∣rious Father agreeing unto it, He has taken our <HI>Debt</HI> upon Him. He said, <HI>Lo, I come to answer the Debt.</HI> He has done so, in the <HI>Expiatory Sufferings,</HI> wherein He became <HI>Obedient unto Death, even unto the Death of the Cross:</HI> And He received an <HI>Acquittance,</HI> as having done it, at His <HI>Rosurrection from the Dead.</HI> Oh! wonderful! Oh! wonderful! Our Saviour now invites us, to come, &amp; plead the <HI>Payment</HI> which He has made, that we may be Released from our <HI>Debt,</HI> and <HI>lay hold on Enternal Life.</HI> Oh! Let us now with a lively Faith, make that Prayer to our Saviour, Psal CXIX. 122. <HI>Be Surety for thy Servant for Good.</HI> Plead it with the Glo∣rious GOD, <HI>Lord, my Saviour has answered the Demands of thy Law in my Room. Oh! Bring my Soul out of Prison, that I may praise thy Name, &amp; Oh! deal bountifully with me.</HI></P>
<P>But then, what a <HI>Debt</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> to Him, who has thus paid our <HI>Debt,</HI> shall we have lying for ever upon us! We must own that <HI>Debt</HI> for ever, and the <HI>Love</HI> of our Saviour, in thus <HI>Ransoming</HI> our Souls, it must <HI>Constrain</HI> us to love Him, &amp; prize Him, &amp; seek Him, &amp; serve Him, and be swallowed up in all possible Endeavours to Glorify Him. O ye <HI>Ransomed of the Lord;</HI> what will you do now for Him, who has discharged a <HI>Debt</HI> for you; wherein if He had not appeared for you, you must have been cast into an horrible, and an infernal <HI>Prison,</HI> from whence you could not have come out un∣til you had <HI>Paid the uttermost Farthing:</HI> — But that,— What Ages must it have called for? — What will you do, but most heartily declare unto him; <HI>Truly, O Lord, I am thy Servant, I am thy Servant, since thou hast loosed my Ponds; Oh! may I be entirely Thine forever more!</HI></P>
