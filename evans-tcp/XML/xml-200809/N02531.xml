</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A Little before in this Chapter, you may read. That the Lord Jesus walked on the Sea, to go to <HI>Capernaum,</HI> having sent his Disciples before in a Ship, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but the Wind was contrary, by which means the Ship was hindred in her Passage. Now, a∣bout the fourth watch of the Night▪ Jesus came walking upon the Sea, and overtok them▪ at the sight of whom they were afraid,</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> When Providences are black and terri∣ble to God's People, the Lord Jesus shews him∣self to them in a wonderful Manner; which sometimes they can as little bear, as they can the things that were before terrible to them. They were afraid of the Wind &amp; Water; they we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e also afraid of their Lord &amp; Saviour, when he appeared to them in that state.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he said, Be not afraid, it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> That the End of the appearing of the Lord Jesus unto his People, (though the manner of his appearing be never so terrible) is to al∣lay their Fears and Perplexities.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003002_0003_0FEF964002C7AB80"/>Then they received him into the Ship, &amp; im∣mediately the Ship was at Land whither it went.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> When Christ is absent from his People, they go on but slowly &amp; with great difficulty; but when he joineth himself unto them; Oh! how fast they steer their Course; how soon are they at their Journeys end.</P>
<P>The People now, among whom he last Preach∣ed, when they saw that both Jesus was gone &amp; his Disciples, they also took Shipping, &amp; came to <HI>Capernaum,</HI> seeking for Jesus. And when they had found him, they wondringly ask'd him, <HI>Rab∣bi, When camest thou hither?</HI> But the Lord Jesus slighting their Complement, answer'd, <HI>Verily, ve∣rily, ye seek me not, because ye saw the Miracles, but because ye did eat of the Loaves, and were filled.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> A People may follow Christ far, for base Ends, as these went after him beyond Sea for Loaves: A Man's Belly may carry him a great way in Religion; yea, a Man's Belly will make him venture far for Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Note</HI> again, They are not feigning Comple∣ments, but gracious Intentions, that crown the Work in the Eye of Christ: Or thus, It is not the Toil &amp; Business of Professors, but their Love to him, that makes him approve of them.</P>
<P><HI>Note</HI> again, When Men shall look for friend∣ly Entertainment at Christ's Hand, (if their Hearts be rotten) even then will they mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with a Check and Rebuke, <HI>Ye seek me not becaus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ye saw the Miracles, but because ye did eat of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oaves and were filled.</HI></P>
<P>Yet observe again, he doth not refuse to giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these, good Counsel; he bids them <HI>Labou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Meat that endureth to eternal Life.</HI> O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> would Jesus Christ have even those Pro¦fessor
<PB N="3" REF="003002_0003_0FEF964002C7AB80"/>
that come to him with Pretences only, come to him sincerely, that they may be saved.</P>
<P>The <HI>Text,</HI> you will find, is after much more Discourse with, &amp; about this People; and it is uttered by the Lord Jesus, at the Conclusion of the whole; &amp; intimateth, that since they were Professors in Patience only, &amp; therefore such as his Soul could not delght in, as such, that he would content himself with a Remnant that his Father had bestowed upon him. As if he should say, I am not like to be honour'd in your Salvation; but the Father hath bestowed upon me a Peeple, &amp; they shall come to me in Truth, &amp; in them will I be satisfy'd. <HI>The Text</HI> before may be called Christ's Repose; in the fulfilling whereof he rested himself content, after much Labour, and many Sermons spent, as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were in vain. As he saith by the Prophet, <HI>I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught, and in vain,</HI> Isa. 49.4.</P>
<P>But as he saith there, <HI>My Judgment is with the Lord, and my Work with my God:</HI> So in the Text he saith; <HI>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me, and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> out.</HI> By these Words therefore, the Lord Jes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> comforteth himself under the Consideration of the Dissimulation of some of his Followers. He also thus betook himself to rest under the Con∣sideration of the little effect that his Ministry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad in <HI>Capernaum, Corazin</HI> &amp; <HI>Bet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>da▪ I thank once, O Father,</HI> said he, <HI>Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast hid these things from the Wise are Prudent, and hast revealed them to Babes, even so, Fa∣ther, for so it seemed good in thy fight.</HI> Mat. 11.25. Luke 10.31.</P>
<P><HI>The Text,</HI> in the general standeth of two parts
<PB N="4" REF="003002_0004_0FEF9A2891427500"/>
and hath special respect to the Father and the Son; as also to their joynt Management of the Salvation of the People. <HI>All that the Father gi∣veth me, shall come to me; and he that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI></P>
<P>The first part of the Text (as is evident) respecteth the Father, &amp; his Gift; the other part, the Son, and the Reception of his Gift.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> For the Gift of the Father, there is this to be Considered; <HI>to wit,</HI></P>
<P>The Gift it self; and that is a Gift of cer∣tain Persons to the Son. The Father giveth, and that Gift shall come: And him that co∣meth: The Gift then is of Persons; The Fa∣ther giveth Persons to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI> Next you have the Son's Reception of this Gift, and that it sheweth it self in these Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the hearty Acknowledgment of it to be a Gift: <HI>The Father giveth me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In his Resolution to bring them to Him∣self; <HI>All that the Father giveth Me, shall come to Me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. And in his determining, that not any thing shall make him dislike them in their coming: <HI>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI></P>
<P>These things might be spoken to at large, as they are in this Method presented to view; but I shall choose to speak to these Words;</P>
<P N="1">1. By way of Explication.</P>
<P N="2">2. By way of Observation.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> By way of Explication; (<HI>All</HI>) <HI>that the Father giveth me.</HI> This Word <HI>All</HI> is often used in Scripture, and is to be taken more largely, or more strictly, even as the Truth or Argu∣ment, for the sake of which it is made use for, will bear: Wherefore, that we may the better
<PB N="5" REF="003002_0004_0FEF9A2891427500"/>
understand the mind of Christ in the use of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> here, we must consider, that it is limited &amp; re¦strained only to those that shall be saved, <HI>to wit,</HI> to those that shall come to Christ, even to thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom he <HI>will in no wise cast out.</HI> Thus also th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Words <HI>All Israel</HI> is sometimes to be taken; (tho' sometimes it is taken for the whole Family of <HI>Jacob</HI>) And so <HI>All Israel</HI> shall be saved. <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. By <HI>All Israel</HI> here he intendeth not <HI>All of Israel</HI> in the largest sense; for they are not <HI>All Isra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> which are of <HI>Israel,</HI> neither because they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> are they <HI>all</HI> Children; <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in</HI> Isaac <HI>shall thy Seed be called</HI>; that is, they wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are the Children of the Flesh, these are not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Children of God, but the Children of the Pro¦mise are counted for the Seed. <HI>Rom.</HI> 9 6, 7,</P>
<P>The word (<HI>All</HI>) therefore, must be limited enlarged, as the Truth &amp; Argument, for the sak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of which it is used, will bear; else we shall a∣buse Scriptures, and Readers, &amp; our Selves, and All. <HI>And I, if I be lifted up from the Earth,</HI> sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ, <HI>will draw</HI> All <HI>Men after Me.</HI> John 12.3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Can any Man imagine that by <HI>all,</HI> in this place he should mean <HI>all</HI> and every individual Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the World; and that not rather that <HI>all</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consonant to the scope of the Place? And if b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being lift up from the Earth, he means as it should seem his being taken up into Heaven; &amp; if, by drawing all Men after Him, he meant a drawing them into that Place of Glory: then must be mean by <HI>all Men,</HI> those &amp; only those that shall in Truth be eternally Saved from the Wrath to come: <HI>For God hath concluded them</HI> all in <HI>Unbelief, that he might have Mercy upon</HI> all, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 11.52. Hence again you have <HI>all</HI> and <HI>all,</HI> two <HI>alls</HI>; but yet a great desparity between the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="003002_0005_0FEF9A2CDD880730"/>
made mention of in the first place, and that <HI>all</HI> made mention of in the second. Those intend∣ed in this Text are the <HI>Jews,</HI> even all of them, by the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <HI>(all)</HI> that you find in the Words. The second <HI>all</HI> doth also intend the same Peo∣ple; but yet only so many of them as God will have Mercy upon. He <HI>hath concluded them</HI> all <HI>in Unbelief, that he might have Mercy upon</HI> all. The <HI>all</HI> also in the Text is likewise to be limi∣ted and restrained to the Saved, and to them only. But again.</P>
<P>The Word (<HI>giveth</HI>) or <HI>hath given,</HI> must be re∣strained after the same manner, to the same li∣mited Number. <HI>All that the Father</HI> giventh <HI>Me</HI>; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>all</HI> that are seven. If you take the Gift of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Father to the Son in the largest sense; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that sense, there are many given to him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot shall never come unto him; yea, many we given unto him, that he will cast out. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all therefore first shew you the Truth of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, and then in what sense the Gift of the Text must be taken.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> all things are given to Christ, if o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> take the Gift of the Father to him in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgest sense, cannot be intended in the Text, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evident.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because then all the Men, yea, all the things in the World must be saved <HI>All things,</HI> Faith he, <HI>are delivered unto me by the Father,</HI> Mat. 11.17. This I think, no rational Man in the World will conclude. Therefore the Gif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended in the <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,</HI> must be restrained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o some to a Gift that's given by way of speciality by the Father to the Son.</P>
<P N="2">2. It must not be taken for all that, in any sense, are given by the Father to him; because
<PB N="7" REF="003002_0005_0FEF9A2CDD880730"/>
the Father hath given some, yea, many to him to be dash'd in pieces by him. <HI>Ask of me</HI> said the Father to him, <HI>and I will give thee the Hea∣then for thine Inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the Earth for thy Possession.</HI> But what must be done with them? Must he save them all? No, <HI>Thou shalt break them with a rod of Iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a Potter's Vessel,</HI> Psal. 2. This Method he useth not with them that he saveth by his Grace, but with those that Him∣self and Saints shall rule over in Justice &amp; Se∣verity, <HI>Rev</HI> 2.26, 27. Yet, as you see, they are given to him. Therefore the Gift intended in the Text, must be restrained to some; to a Gift that is given by way of specialty by the Father to the Son.</P>
<P>In <HI>Psal</HI> 18 He saith plainly, that some are given to him, that he might destroy them; <HI>Thou hast given me the Necks of mine Enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me,</HI> ver. 40. These therefore cannot be of the Number of those that are said to be given in the Text; for those, even <HI>all</HI> of them, shall come to him, and he <HI>will in no wise cast them out.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Some are given to Christ, that he by them might bring about some of his high and deep Designs in the World. Thus <HI>Judas</HI> was given to Christ, <HI>viz</HI> That by him, even as he was de∣termined before, he might bring about his Death, &amp; so the Salvation of his Elect by his Blood. Yea, and <HI>Judas</HI> must so manage this Business, as that he may lose himself for ever in bringing it so to pass: Therefore the Lord Je∣sus, even in his losing of <HI>Judas,</HI> applies himself to the Judgment of his Father, if he had not in that thing done that which was right, even
<PB N="8" REF="003002_0006_0FEF9A306D0E0AD8"/>
in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ring <HI>Judas</HI> so to bring about his Masters D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch, as that he might by so doing bring a∣bout his own eternal Damnation.</P>
<P><HI>Those</HI> said he, <HI>that thou gavest me have I kept, and none of them is lost but the Son of Perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled,</HI> John 17.12. Let us then grant that <HI>Judas</HI> was given to Christ, but not as others are given to him; nor of those made mention of in the Text; for then he should have failed to have been so received by Christ, and kept to eternal Life. Indeed he was given to Christ, but he was given to him to lose him in the way that I have mentioned be∣fore; he was given to Christ, that he by him might bring about his own death, as was before determin'd, &amp; that in the overthrow of him that did it. Yea, he must bring about his own Death, as was before determin'd; and that in the overthrow of him that did it: Yea, he must bring about his Dying for us, in the loss of the Instrument that betray'd him; that he might even fulfil the Scripture in his Destruction, as well as in the Salvation of the rest. <HI>And none of them is lost, but the Son of Perdi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on▪ that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</HI></P>
<P>The Gift therefore in the Text must not be taken in the largest Sense, but even as the Words will bear, <HI>viz.</HI> For such a Gift as he accepteth, and promiseth to be an effectual means of E∣ternal Salvation to. <HI>All that the Father giveth Me, shall come to Me; and him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> Mark! They shall come that are in special given to Me; and they shall by no means be rejected; For this is the Sub∣stance of the Text.</P>
<P>Those therefore intended, as the Gift in the
<PB N="9" REF="003002_0006_0FEF9A306D0E0AD8"/>
Text, are those that are given by Covenant to the Son; those that in other places are called the Elect, the Chosen, and the Sheep, and the Children of the Promise, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>These be they that the Father hath given to Christ to keep them; those that Christ hath pro∣mised eternal Life unto; those to whom he hath given his Word, and that he will have with him in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Kingdom, to behold his Glory.</P>
<P><HI>This is the Wall of the Faather that hath sent me, that of those that he hath given me, I should lose no∣thing, but should raise it up at the last Day, and I give unto them eternal Life, and they shall never Pe∣rish; neither shall any man pluck them out of my Hand. My Father that gave them me, is greater than all; and no Man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers Hand. As thou hast given him pow∣er over all Flesh, that he should give eternal Life to as many as thou hast given him. Thine they were, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy Word: I Pray for them: I Pray not for the World, but for those that thou hast given me, for they are thine; and all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am Glorified in them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Keep through thine own Name, those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one as we are Father, I will that those wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou hast given me▪ may be with me where I am; that they may be, hold my Glory which thou hast given me; for thou lovedst me before the Foundation of the World,</HI> Joh. 6.39 Chap. 10 28. Chap. 17.26 9 10 24.</P>
<P>All these Sentences are of the same in port with the Text; and the <HI>Alls</HI> and <HI>Manys. These They,</HI> &amp;c in these their several Sayings of Christ, are the same with all the <HI>Given</HI> in the Text. <HI>All that the Father giveth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003002_0007_0FEF9A33AFFCF150"/>So that (as I said before) the Word <HI>all,</HI> as also other Words, must not be taken in such sort as our foolish Fancies, or groundless. Opinions will prompt us to; but do admit of an Enlargement, or Restriction, according to the true Meaning and Intent of the Text. We must therefore diligently consult the mean∣ing of the Text, by comparing it with other the Sayings of God; so shall we be better a∣ble to find out the Mind of the Lord in the Word which he hath given us to know it by.</P>
<P><HI>As that the (Father) giveth.</HI></P>
<P>By this word (<HI>Father</HI>) Christ describeth the Person giving; by which we may learn se∣veral useful things: 1. That the Lord God &amp; Fa∣ther of our Lord Jesus Christ, is concerned with the Son, in the Salvation of his People. True, his Acts, as to our Salvation, are di∣verse from those of the Son; he was not capable of doing that, or those things for us, as did the Son; he Died not, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e spilt not his Blood for our Redemption, as the Son; but yet he hath a Hand, a great Hand in our Salvation too. As Christ saith, The F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ther himself loveth you, and his love is ma∣nifest in chusing of us, in giving us to his Son; yea, and in giving his Son also to be a Ransom for us. Hence he is called, <HI>The Father of Mercies, and the God of all Comforts▪ For here even the Father hath himself found out and made way for his Grace to come to us, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Sides and the Heart's Blood of his well belo∣ved Son,</HI> Col. 1.12. The Father therefore is to be remembred and adored, as one having a chief Hand in the Salvation of Sinners: we ought to give Thanks to the Father, who
<PB N="11" REF="003002_0007_0FEF9A33AFFCF150"/>
hath made us meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light; for the Fa∣ther sent the Son to be the Saviour of the World, 1 <HI>John</HI> 4.14. <HI>Col.</HI> 1.2. As also we see in the Text, the Father giveth the Sinner to save him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Christ Jesus the Lord, by this word Father, would familiarize this Giver to us; Naturally the Name of God is dreadful to us, especially when he is discovered to us by these Names that declare his Justice, Holi∣ness, Power, and Glory: But now this word Father, is a familiar Word, it frighteth not the Sinner, but rather inclineth his Heart to Love, &amp; be pleased with the Remembrance of him Hence Christ also when he would have us to pray with godly Boldness, puts this word Father into our Mouths; saying. <HI>Our Father which art in Heaven</HI>; concluding thereby, that by the Familiarity that by such a Word is intima∣ted, the Children of God may take more Bold∣ness to pray for, &amp; to ask great Things. I my self have often found, that when I can say, but this word Father it doth me more good, than when I call him by any other Scripture Name. 'Tis worth your noting, that to call God by his Re∣lative Title, was rare among the Saints in Old Testament Times; seldom do you find him called by this Name; no sometimes not in three or four Books; but now in New Testament Times, he is ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led by no Name so often as this, both by the Lord Jesus himself, and by the Apostles afterwards. Indeed the Lord Jesus was the first that made this Name common a∣mong the Sun's, and that taught them both in their Discourses, their Prayers, &amp; in their Wri∣tings,

so much to use it; it being more plea∣sing to, and discovering more plainly our Inte∣rest in God, than any other Expression; for by this one Name we are made to understand, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all our Mercies are the Off-spring of God, and that we also that are called, are his Children by Adoption.</P>
<P><HI>All that the Father (giveth)</HI></P>
<P>This Word (<HI>giveth</HI>) is out of Christ's Ordi∣nary Dialect; and seemeth to intimate at the first sound, as if the Father's Gift to the Son was not an Act that is past, but one that is present and continuing; when indeed this Gift was bestowed upon Christ, when the Covenant, the eternal Covenant was made between them before all Worlds. Wherefore in those other places, when this Gift is mentioned, it is still spoken of as an Act that is pass: As, <HI>All that he hath given me? To as many as thou hast given me: Thou gavest them me, and these which thou hast given me.</HI> Therefore of necessity this must be the first and chief sense of the T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt. I mean of this <HI>(gi∣veth)</HI> otherwise the Doctrine of Election, &amp; of the eternal Covenant which was made between the Father and the Son (in which Covenant this Gift of the Father is most certainly com∣prized) will be sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken, or at leastwise questionable by erroneous and wicked Men: For they may say, That the Father gave not all those to Christ that shall be saved before the World was made; or that this Act of giving is an Act of Continuation.</P>
<P>But again, this word <HI>(giveth</HI>) is not to be re∣jected; for it hath its proper Use, and may signifie to us;</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That though the Act of <HI>Giving</HI> among
<PB N="13" REF="003002_0008_0FEF9A3640E26CD8"/>
Men doth admit of the Time past, or the Time to come, and is to be spoken of with Reference to such Time; yet with God it is not so. Things past, or things to come, are always present with God, &amp; with his Son Jesus Christ: He calleth things that are not, (that is to us) as though they were. And again, <HI>Known unto God are all his Works from the Foundation of the World. All things to God are present, and so the Gift of the Father to the Son, although to us, as is mani∣fest by the Word, it is an Act that is past,</HI> Rom. 4.17. Acts 15.10.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Christ may express himself thus, to shew that the Father hath not only given him this Portion in the Lump, before the World was; but that those he had so given, he will give him again, that he will bring them to him at the time of their Conversion; for the Father bringeth them to Christ, <HI>John</HI> 6.44.</P>
<P>As it is said, <HI>She shall be brought unto the King in Raiment of Needle-work</HI>; that is, in the Righte∣ousness of Christ; <HI>For it is God that imputeth that to those that are saved,</HI> Psal. 45.14. 1 Cor. 1.</P>
<P>A Man giveth his Daughter to such a Man first in order to Marriage, and this respects the time past, and he giveth her again at the Day appointed in Marriage: And in this last Sense, perhaps the Text may have a meaning; That is, That all that the Father hath (before the World was) given to Jesus Christ, he giveth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem them again to him, in the Day of their Espousals.</P>
<P>Things that are given among Men are oft-times, best at first, <HI>to wit,</HI> when they are new; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reason is▪ because all earthly Things wax o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; but with Christ it is not so: This
<PB N="14" REF="003002_0009_0FEF9A3B5D5C5798"/>
Gift of the Father is not old nor deformed, and unpleasant in his Eyes; and therefore to him 'tis always new. When the Lord spake of gi∣ving the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> he saith not that he had give, or would give it them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but thus, <HI>The Lord thy God giveth thee this good Land,</HI> Deut. 9 6. Not but that he had given it to them while they were in the Loins of their Fathers, Hundreds of Years before. Yet he saith now, he giveth it to them: as if they were now also in the very Act of taking Pos∣session, when as yet they were on the other side <HI>Jordan.</HI> What then should be the meaning? Why, I take it to be this: That the Land should be to them always as new, as new; as if they were taking Possession thereof but now. And so is the Gift of the Father mentioned in the Text, to the Son; it is always new, as if it were always new.</P>
<P><HI>All that the Father giveth (Me)</HI></P>
<P>In these Words you find mention made of Two Persons, the Father and the Son; the Father giving, and the Son receiving, or ac∣cepting of this Gift. This then in the first place, clearly demonstrateth, That the Father and the Son, tho' they, with the Holy Ghost are One and the same Eternal God; yet as their Personality are distinct. <HI>The Father is One, the Son is One, and the Holy Spirit as One.</HI> But because there is in this Text mention made but of Two of the Three, therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> word about these Two The Giver and Re∣ceiver cannot be the same Person in a proper sense, in the same Act of Giving and Recei∣ving He that giveth, giveth not to himself, but to another; the Father giveth no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="15" REF="003002_0009_0FEF9A3B5D5C5798"/>
not to the Father, <HI>to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> to himself; but to the Son: So when the Father gi∣veth Commandment, he giveth it not to himself, but to another; as Christ saith, <HI>He that giveth me Commandment,</HI> John 12.49 So again, <HI>I am one that beareth Witness of my self and the Father that sent me beareth Witness of me,</HI> John 10 18.</P>
<P>Further, Here is something implied that is not expressed, <HI>to wit,</HI> that the Father hath not given all Men to Christ; that is, in the sense as is intended in the Text; tho' in a larger, as was before, <HI>He hath given him every one of them</HI>; for then all should be saved: He hath therefore disposed of some another way. He gives some up to Idolatry; he gives some up to Unclean∣ness, to vile Affections, and to a Reprobate Mind. Now these he disposeth of in his Anger, for their Destruction; (<HI>Acts</HI> 3.42. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.24.26.28) <HI>That they may reap the Fruits of their Doings, and be filled with the Reward of their own Ways.</HI> But neithet hath he thus disposed of all Men; he hath even of Mercy reserved some from these Judgments, and those are they that he will par∣don; as he saith, <HI>For I will pardon them whom I reserve,</HI> Jer. 50.20. Now these he hath given to Jesus Christ by Will as a Legacy and Portion. Hence the Lord Jesus says, <HI>This is the Father's Will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise is up again at the last Day,</HI> John 36 29.</P>
<P>The Father therefore, in giving of them to him to save them, must needs declare unto us these following Things:</P>
<P N="1">1. That he is able to answer this Design of God, <HI>viz.</HI> To save them to the uttermost Sin, the uttermost Temptation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Heb. 7.25. Hence
<PB N="16" REF="003002_0010_0FEF9A3F21F7A208"/>
he is said <HI>to lay help upon one that is mighty migh∣ty to save</HI>: And hence it is again, <HI>That God did even of old promise to send his People a Saviour, a great one,</HI> Psal. 9.16. Isa 63 1. To save is a great Work, and calls for Almightiness in the Under∣taker: Hence he is called, <HI>The mighty God, the wonderful Counsell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, &amp;c.</HI> Sin is strong, Satan is also strong, Death and the Grave are strong, &amp; so is the Curse of the Law; therefore it fol∣lows, that this Jesus must needs be by God the Father accounted Almighty, in <HI>that</HI> he hath given his Elect to him to save them, &amp; deliver them from these, and that an despite of all their Force and Power.</P>
<P>And he gave us Testimony of this his Might, when he was employed in that part of our De∣liverance, <HI>that</HI> called for a Declaration of it. He abolished Death; he destroyed him <HI>that</HI> had the Power of Death; he was the Destruction of the Grave; he hath finished Sin, and made an end of it, as to its damning Effects upon the Persons <HI>that</HI> the Father hath given him; he hath vanquished the Curse of the Law, nailed it to his Cross, triumphed over them upon his Cross, and made a shew of these things openly, 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 1 10. <HI>Heb</HI> 2 14 15 <HI>Hos</HI> 13.14. <HI>Dan</HI> 9 24. <HI>Gal.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 13 <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 15, 19 Yea, and even now, as a sign of his Triumph and Conquest. <HI>He is alive from the Dead, and hath the Keys of Hell and Death on his own keeping.</HI> Rev. 1.18.</P>
<P>The Father's giving of them to him to save them, declares unto us, that he is, and will be faithful in his Office of a Mediator▪ &amp; <HI>that</HI> threfore they shall be secured from the Fruit &amp; Wages of their Sins, which is eternal Damnation, by his faithful Execution of it. And indeed it is
<PB N="17" REF="003002_0010_0FEF9A3F21F7A208"/>
said, even by the Holy Ghost himself, <HI>That he is faithful to him that appointed him,</HI> that is to this Work of saving those that the Father hath gi∣ven him for that purpose; as <HI>Moses</HI> was faithful in all his House; yea, and more faithful too: for <HI>Moses</HI> was faithful in God's House, but as a Servant; but Christ as a Son, over his own House, <HI>Heb</HI> 3.</P>
<P>And therefore this Man is counted worthy of more Glory than <HI>Moses,</HI> even upon this ac∣count, because more faithful than he, as well as because of the Dignity of his Person. There∣fore in him and in his Truth and Faithfulness, God rested well pleased, and hath put all the Government of his People upon his shoulders. Knowing that nothing shall be wanting in him, that may any way perfect this Design. And of this He, <HI>to wit,</HI> the Son hath already given a proof; for when the time was come, that his Blood was, by Divine Justice required for their Redemption, Washing and Cleansing, He as freely poured out of his Heart, as if it had been Water out of a Vessel; not sticking to part with his own Life, that the Life which was laid up for his People in Heaven, might not fail to be bestowed upon them And upon this Account (as well as upon any other) it is that God calleth him his Righteous Servant, <HI>Isa.</HI> 53. for his Righteousness could never have been compleat, if he had not been to the uttermost faithful to the Work he undertook: It is also, because he is faithful and true, that in Righte∣ousness he doth judge, and make Work for his People's Deliverance He will faithfully per∣form this trust reposed in him: The Father knows this, and hath therefore given his Elect, unto him.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="003002_0011_0FEF9A4266F586A8"/><HI>Thirdly.</HI> The Father's giving of them to His to save them, declares that he is, and will be gentle and patient towards them, under all the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Provocations and Miscarriages. It is not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> imagined the Tryals and Provocations that t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Son of God hath all along had with these Peo∣ple, that have been given to him that save them: Indeed he is said to be a tried Stone for He has been tried, not only by the De∣vil, Guilt of Sin, Death, and the Curse of the Law, but also by his People's Ignorance, Unru∣liness, falls into Sin, and declining to Errors in Life and Doctrine. Were we but capable of seeing how the Lord Jesus has been Tried, even by his People, ever since there was one of them in the World, we should be amazed at his pati∣ence and gentle Carriages to them. It is said indeed, <HI>The Lord is very Pitiful, slow to Anger, and and of great Mercy:</HI> And indeed if He had not been so, He could never have endured their Manners as he has done▪ from <HI>Adam</HI> hitherto. Therefore is his Pity and Bowels towards his Church, preferred above the Pity and Bowels of a Mother towards her Child. <HI>Can a Wom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> forget her sucking Child, that she should not have com∣passi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n on the Son of her Womb? Yea, they may for∣get; yet I will not forget thee, siaith the Lord,</HI> Isa. 49 15</P>
<P>God did once give <HI>Moses,</HI> as Christ's Servant, an Handful of his People, to carry them in his Bosom, but no farther than from <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Ca∣naan</HI>; and this <HI>Moses,</HI> as it is said of him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Holy Ghost, was the merkest Man that was then to be f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und on the Earth; yea, &amp; he loved the People at a very great R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, yet neither would his Meckness nor Love hold out in this Work;
<PB N="19" REF="003002_0011_0FEF9A4266F586A8"/>
he failed and grew passionate, even to provo∣king his God to Anger under this Work. And <HI>Moses</HI> said unto the Lord, <HI>Wherefore hast thou Af∣flicted thy Servant?</HI> But what was the Affliction? Why the Lord had said unto him, <HI>Carry this Peo∣ple in thy B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>som, as a musing Father beareth the sucking Child, unto the Land that he sware unto their Fathers.</HI> And how then? <HI>Not I,</HI> says Moses; <HI>I am not able to bear all this People, because it is too heavy for me: If thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, and let me not see my wretch∣edness,</HI> Num. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1 11, 12, 13, 14.

<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> The Father giving of him to save them; declares, <HI>that</HI> he hath a S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficiency of Wisdom, to wage with all those D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lties <HI>that</HI> would attend him in bringing of his Sons and Daughters unto Glory, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1 30. He hath made him to us to be Wisdom; yea, he is called Wisdom it self, <HI>And God saith moreover, That he shall deal prudently,</HI> Isa. 52.13. And indeed, he <HI>that</HI> shall take upon him to be the Saviour of the People, had need to be wise, because their

Adversaries are subtile above any. Here they are to encounter with the Serpent, who for his Subtilty, <HI>outwitted</HI> our Father and Mother, when their Wisdom was at highest, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. But if we talk of Wisdom, our Jesus is wise, Wiser than <HI>Solomon,</HI> Wiser than all Men, Wiser than all An∣gels; He is even the Wisdom of God. <HI>Christ the Wisdom of God,</HI> (Col. 1.1.) And hence it is He turneth Sins, Temptations, Perscutions, Falls, and all things for good unto his People, (<HI>Rom</HI> 8</P>
<P>Now these things thus concluded on, do shew us also the great and wonderful Love of the Father, in that He should chose out one, every way so well prepared for the Work of Man's Salvation.</P>
<P>Here indeed perceive we the Love of God. <HI>Hiram</HI> gathered, That God loved <HI>Israel▪</HI> because he had given them such a King as <HI>Solomon,</HI> (2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 2.11.) But how much more may we be∣hold the Love that God hath bestowed upon us, in that he hath given us to his Son, &amp; also his Son for us.</P>
<P><HI>All that the Father giveth me (shall come.</HI>)</P>
<P>In these last words, there is closely inserted, an Answer unto the Father's End, in giving of his Elect to Jesus Christ. The Father's End was, that they might come to him, &amp; be saved by him; and that says the Son, shall be done; neither Sin nor Satan, neither Flesh and World, neither Wisdom nor Folly, shall hinder their coming to me. <HI>They shall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI></P>
<P>Here therefore the Lord Jesus positively de∣termineth, to put forth such a sufficiency of all Grace, as shall effectually perform his Promise▪ <HI>They shall come:</HI> that is, he will cause them to
<PB N="21" REF="003002_0012_0FEF9A445733DD78"/>
come, by infusing of an effectual Blessing in to all the means that shall be used to that end. As was said to the evil Spirit, that was seen to perswade <HI>Ahab</HI> to go and fall a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Ramoth G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lead; Go, thou shalt perswade him, and prevail also? go forth, and do so,</HI> 1 Kings 22.22. So will Jesus Christ say, to the means than shall be used, for the bringing of those to him that the Father hath given him. I say, he will bless it effectually to this very end▪ it shall perswade them, and shall prevail al∣so. Else, as I said, the Father's end would be frustrate: For the Father's Will is, <HI>that, of all that he hath given him, he should lose no∣thing, but should raise it up at the last Day,</HI> in order next unto himself, <HI>Christ the first Fruits, afterwards those that are his, at his Coming,</HI> (1 Cor. 15.) But this cannot be done, if there should fail to be a Work of Grace effec∣tually wrought, though but in any one of them. But this shall not fail to be wrought in any one of them. But this shall not fail to be wrought in them, even in all that the Father hath given him to save. <HI>All that the Father hath given me shall come to me,</HI> &amp;c. But to speak more distinctly to the Words, <HI>They shall come</HI>; Two things I should shew you from these Words.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> What it is to come to Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> What force there is in this Promise, to make them come to him.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I would shew you what it is to come to Christ. This word Come, must be understood Spiritually, not Carnally; for many came to him Carnally, or Bodily, that had no saving Advantage by him: Multitudes did thus come unto him in the days of his flesh, yea, innume∣rable
<PB N="22" REF="003002_0013_0FEF9A46E4391DF8"/>
Companies. There is also at this day a formal Customary coming to his Ordinances, and ways of Worship, which availeth not any thing; but with them I shall not now meddle; for they are net intended in the Text. The Coming then intended in the Text, is to be un∣derstood of the Coming of the Mind to him, even the moving of the Heart towards him, I say, the moving of the Heart towards him, from a sound sense of the absolute want that a Man hath of Him for his Justification and Salvation.</P>
<P>This Description of Coming to Christ, divi∣deth it self into Two Heads.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That Coming to Christ, is a moving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Mind towards Him.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That it is a moving of the Min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> towards Him, from a sound Sense of the abso∣lute want that a Man hath of Him for his Jus∣tification and Salvation.</P>
<P>To speak to the first, That is a moving o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Mind towards him. This is evident, be∣cause Coming hither or thither, if it be volun∣tary, is by an Act of the Mind or Will; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Coming to Christ is, through the inclining▪ the Will, <HI>Thy People shall be willing,</HI> Psal. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. This willingness of heart is it which se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Mind a moving after, or towards Christ by the moving of her Bowels. <HI>My Belo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> put <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Hand by the Hole of the Door, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bowels were moved for him.</HI> Song 4 5.

<P><PB N="23" REF="003002_0013_0FEF9A46E4391DF8"/>This then is the coming to Christ, even a moving towards him with the Mind. <HI>And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth whithersoever the Water shall come, shall live, Ezek</HI> 47.9.</P>
<P>The Water in this Text, is the Grace of God in the Doctrine of it; the living things are the children of Men, to whom the Grace of God, by the Gospel is preached. <HI>Now,</HI> saith he, <HI>every living thing which moveth whithersoever the Waters shall come, shall live.</HI> And see how this Word (moveth) is expounded by Christ himself, in the Book of the <HI>Revelations; the Spirit and the Bride say, Come, and let him that heareth say come, and let him that is athirst, Come; and whosoever will, that is willing let him take the Water of Life freely,</HI> R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 22.17.</P>
<P>So that to move in thy Mind and Will after Christ, is to be coming to him. There are ma∣ny poor Souls that are coming to Christ, that yet cannot tell how to believe it, because they think that coming to him is some strange and wonderful thing, and indeed so it is. But I mean, they overlook the Inclination of these Will, the moving of their Mind, &amp; the sound∣ing of these Bowels after him; &amp; count these none of this strange &amp; wonderful thing; when indeed it is a work of greatest wonder in this World, to see a Man who was sometimes dead in Sin, poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed of the Devil, an Enemy to Christ, and to all things spiritually good: I say, to see this Man moving with his mind af∣ter the Lord Jesus Christ, is one of the highest Wonders in the World.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is a moving of the mind towards him, from a sound Sense of the absolute want that a Man hath of him for his Justification &amp;
<PB N="24" REF="003002_0014_0FEF9A4D355D9730"/>
Salvation Indeed without this Sense of a lost Condition without him, there will be no mo∣ving of the mind towards him: A moving of their Mouth there may be; <HI>With their mouth they shew much Love,</HI> Ezek 33.31. Such a People as this will come as the true People cometh; <HI>that</HI> is, in shew and outward Appearance; and they will sit before God's Ministers, as his People sit before them; and they will hear his Words too, but they will not do them; that is, will not come inwardly with their Minds; For with their Mouth they shew much Love, but their Heart (or Mind) goeth after their Cove∣tousness. Now all this is, because they want an effectual sense of the Misery of their State by Nature; for not till they have <HI>that,</HI> will they in their Mind move oftner to him. There∣fore thus it is said concerning the true Comers. <HI>At that Day the Trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come that were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the out-casts of the land of Egypt, and shall wor∣ship the Lord in his holy Mountain at Jerusalem, Isa.</HI> 17.13. They are then, as you see, the Outcasts, as those that are ready to perish: <HI>that</HI> have their Minds effectually moved to come to Je∣sus Christ. This sense of things was <HI>that which</HI> made the Three Thousand come; <HI>that</HI> made <HI>Saul</HI> come; that made the Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ler come; and <HI>that</HI> indeed makes all others come, <HI>that</HI> come effec∣tually, <HI>Acts</HI> 21.8.16.</P>

<PB N="25" REF="003002_0014_0FEF9A4D355D9730"/>
that was only in Samaria; and of these the Lepers had no share, for they were thrust with∣out the City. Well now they sat in the Gate of the City, and Hunger was, as I may say, ma∣king his last Meal of them; &amp; being therefore half dead already, what do they think of do∣ing? Why, first they display the dismal Co∣lours of Death before each others Faces, and then resolve what to do, saying, <HI>If we say we will go into the City, then the Famine is in the City, and we shall dye there; if we sit still here, we dye also; now therefore come, let us fall into the Host of the</HI> Syrians; <HI>if they save us alive we shall live; if they kill us, we shall but dye</HI> Here now was Necessity at Work, and this Necessity drove them to go thither for Life, whither else they would never have gone for it. Thus it is with them <HI>that</HI> in truth come to Jesus Christ; Death is before them, they see it and feel it; he is feeding upon them, and will eat them quite up if they come not to Jesus Christ; and therefore they come even of Necessity, being forced thereto by <HI>that</HI> sense they have of their being utterly and everlastingly undone, if they find not safety in him.</P>
<P>These are they <HI>that</HI> will come; indeed these are they <HI>that</HI> are invited to come. <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest,</HI> Mat. 11.28</P>
<P>Take two or three things to make this more plain; <HI>to wit,</HI> that coming to Christ floweth from a deep Sense of the absolute need <HI>that</HI> a Man hath of him as afore.</P>
<P N="1">1. They shall come with weeping &amp; with Supplication will I lead them; I will cause them to walk by the Rivers of Waters, in a
<PB N="26" REF="003002_0015_0FEF9A52E4F40988"/>
plain way, wherein they shall not stumble, <HI>Jer</HI> 31.9, Mind it! They come with weeping and Supplication; they come with Prayers &amp; Tear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Now Prayers &amp; Tears are the effects of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Sense of the Need of Mercy. Thus a sensele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Sinner cannot come, he cannot pray, he canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cry, he cannot come sensible of that he see not, nor feels. In those days, and at that time the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> shall come; they and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Child of <HI>Judah</HI> together, going &amp; weeping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>they shall seek the Lord their God; they shall ask th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> way to</HI> Zion, <HI>with their Faces thitherward,</HI> saying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Come, and let us join our selves to the Lord on a per¦petual Covenant that shall not be forgotten,</HI> Jer 50.4.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> This coming to Christ, it is called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Running to him; as flying to him; a flying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him from the Wrath to come. By all whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Terms, is set forth the sense of the Man th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> comes, <HI>to wit,</HI> That he is affected with the sens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his Sins, and the Death due thereto; <HI>that</HI> he is sensible <HI>that</HI> the avenger of Blood pursue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him, and <HI>that</HI> therefore he is cut off, if he makes not speed to the Son of God for Life <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.7. <HI>Psal.</HI> 143 9 Flying is the last Work o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Man in Danger, all <HI>that</HI> are in danger, do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y; no, not all <HI>that</HI> see themselves in danger; flying is the last work of a man in danger; all <HI>that</HI> hear of danger will not fly. Men will consider, if there be no other way to escape be∣fore they fly. Therefore, as I said, flying is the last thing. When all Refuge fails, &amp; a Man is made to see <HI>that</HI> there is nothing left him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sin, Death and Damnation, unless he flies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ for Life, then he flies, &amp; not till them</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the true Coming is from a sen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of an absolute need of Jesus Christ to save, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the outcry that is made by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="27" REF="003002_0015_0FEF9A52E4F40988"/>
to come, even as they are coming to him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 14.30. Acts 2.37. Acts 16.30. <HI>Lord, save, or I pe∣rish. Men and Brethren, what shall we do? Sirs, What must I do to be saved?</HI> and the like. This Lan∣guage doth sufficiently discover, <HI>that</HI> the truly coming Souls, are Souls sensible of their need of Salvation by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> It is yet farther evident, by these few things that follow: It is said <HI>that</HI> such are Pricked in their Hearts, <HI>that</HI> is, with the Sen∣tence of Death by the Law; &amp; the least prick in the Heart kills a Man. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. Such are said, as I said before, to weep, to tremble, and to be astonished in themselves at the evident &amp; unavoidable Danger <HI>that attends</HI> them, unless they fly to Jesus Christ▪ <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts</HI> 9.16.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Coming to Christ is attended with an honest and sincere forsaking all for him. <HI>If any Man cometh unto me, and hateth not his Father, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Sisters, yea, and his own Life also, he cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e my Disciple; and whosoever▪ doth not bear his Cross, and come after me, cannot be my Disciple, Luke</HI> 14 26, 27.</P>
<P>By these and the like Expressions else where, Christ describeth the true Comer, or the Man <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat</HI> indeed is coming to him: He is one <HI>that</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat cast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h off all, he hateth all things <HI>that would</HI> stand in his Way to hinder his coming to Je∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Christ. There▪ are a great many pretended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omers to Jesus Christ in the World; &amp; they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re much like to <HI>that</HI> Man <HI>that</HI> you read of in Mat. 21.30. that said to this Father bidding, I go Sir, and went not. I say there are a great ma∣ny such Comers to Jesus Christ; they say when Christ calls by his Gospel, I come Sir; but
<PB N="28" REF="003002_0016_0FEF9A548B649488"/>
still they abide by their Pleasure and carnal Delights They come not at all, only they give him a courtly Compliment; but he takes no∣tice of it, and well not let it pass for more than a Lie. He said, <HI>I go Sir, and went not</HI>; He Dis¦sembled and Lied. Take heed of this you <HI>tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> flatter</HI> your selves with your own Deceivings▪ Words will not do with Jesus Christ: Coming is coming, and nothing else will go for Co∣ming with him.</P>
<P>Before I speak to the other Head, I shall an∣swer some Objections <HI>that</HI> usually lie in the Way of those <HI>that</HI> in truth are coming to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Object. 1. <HI>Tho' I cannot deny but my mind suit after Christ, and that too as being moved thereto from a sight and consideration of my lost Condition, (for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> see without Him I perish) yet I fear my ends an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not right in coming to him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> Why, what is thine End in coming to Christ?</P>
<P>Answ. <HI>My End is, that I might have Life, and be saved by Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Objection. Well let me tell thee, that to come to Christ for Life, &amp; to be saved, although at present thou hast no other end, is a lawful and good coming to Jesus Christ. This is evident, because Christ propoundeth Life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the only Argument to prevail with Sinners t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come to him, and so also blameth the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> because they come not to him for Life. <HI>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will not come to me that ye might have Life,</HI> Joh. 5 3. Besides there are many other Scriptures. whereby he allureth Sinners to come to him, in which he propoundeth nothing to them but their safety. As, <HI>he that believeth in him, shall
<PB N="29" REF="003002_0016_0FEF9A548B649488"/>
not perish; he that believeth is passed from Death to Life. He that believeth shall be saved. He that be∣lieveth on him, is not condemned.</HI> And believing and coming are all one. So <HI>that</HI> you see to come to Christ for Life, is a lawful coming, &amp; good.</P>
<P N="1">1. In that he believeth <HI>that</HI> he alone hath made <HI>Attonement</HI> for Sin, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>And let me add over and above, <HI>that</HI> for a Man to come to Christ for Life, tho' he come to him for nothing else but Life, is to give much Honour to Him.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> He honoureth the Word of Christ, &amp; consenteth to the Truth of it; and <HI>that</HI> in these two general Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. He consenteth to the truth of all those Sayings <HI>that</HI> testifie <HI>that</HI> Sin is most abomi∣nable in it self, dishonourable to God▪ and damnable to the Soul of man For thus saith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Man <HI>that</HI> cometh to Jesus Christ, <HI>Jer.</HI> 44.4. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.23. Chap. 6.23. 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.12.</P>
<P N="2">2. In <HI>that</HI> he believeth, as the Word hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid, <HI>that</HI> there is in the World's best things, Righteousness and all, nothing but Death and Damnation; for so also says the Man that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omes to Jesus Christ for Life, <HI>Ro.</HI> 7.24, 25. <HI>chap.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2.3. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6 7, 8.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> He honoureth Christ's Person, in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat</HI> he believeth <HI>that</HI> there is Life in him. &amp; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat</HI> he is able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave him from Death, Hell, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Devil and Damnation; for unless a Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elieve this, he will not come to Christ for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fe. <HI>Heb.</HI> 7 24, 25.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> He honoureth him, in <HI>that</HI> he be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>veth <HI>that</HI> he is Authorized of the Father, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> give Life to those <HI>that</HI> come to him for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.11, 12. <HI>chap.</HI> 17.1, 2, 3.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="003002_0017_0FEF9A561E677280"/><HI>Fourthly,</HI> He honoureth the Priesthood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. In <HI>that</HI> he believeth <HI>that</HI> Christ hath n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Power to save from Sin, by the Sacrifice <HI>tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> hath offered for it, than hath all the Law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦vils, Death, or Sin to condemn. He <HI>that</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦lieves not this, will not come to Jesus C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Life, <HI>Acts</HI> 13 38. Heb. 2 14, 15 <HI>Rev</HI> 1.17 18</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> In <HI>that</HI> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> believes, <HI>that</HI> Christ acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ing to his Office, will be most faithful &amp; m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ciful in the Discharge of his Office. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be included in the faith of him <HI>that</HI> comes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> life to Jesus Christ, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.1, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 3. <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.17, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Farther, he <HI>that</HI> cometh to J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ for life, taketh part with him against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; against the ragged &amp; unperfect Righteous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> World; yea, &amp; against false Christs, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> damnable Errors, <HI>that</HI> set themselves against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Worthiness of his Merits &amp; Sufficiency: Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evident, for <HI>that</HI> such a Soul singleth Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from them all, as the only One that can sav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Therefore, as <HI>Noah</HI> at Gods Comma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou preparedst this Ark for the saving of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> self, by the which also thou condemnest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> World, &amp; art become Heir of the Righte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦ness, which is by Faith, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.17.

<P>Thou then <HI>that</HI> art indeed the coming Sin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, believest all this?

<P>Before I conclude my Answer to this Objection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e into thy Consideration these Two Things.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the Cities of Refuge were erected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those <HI>that</HI> were dead in the Law, &amp; <HI>that</HI> yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> live by Grace, even for those <HI>that</HI> were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hither for Life from the Avenger of Blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pursueth after them.

<P>Secondly, Consider that of <HI>Ahab</HI> when Benha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ad sent to him for Life, saying; Thus saith t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Son <HI>Benhadad,</HI> I pray thee, let me Live Thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Benhadad</HI> had sought the Crown &amp; Kingdom, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and also the Life of <HI>Ahab</HI>; yet how effectual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> doth <HI>Benhadad</HI> prevail with him.

Well, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut how was he received of the Lord of the Vineyard; Why, when Pay-day came, he had even as much as the rest, yea, had his Money first. True, the others murmured at him; but what did the Lord Jesus answer them? <HI>Is thine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Evil, because mine is good?

<P>Therefore is every sincere Come<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Jesus Christ called also the Child of the Promises. <HI>Now my Brethren, as</HI> Isaac <HI>was, so are we the Children of the Promise, Gal.</HI> 4.28.

<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> This Word (shall come) engageth Christ to communicate all manner of Grace to those thus given him, to make them ef∣fectually come to him, <HI>They shall come</HI>; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, not if they will, but if Grace, all Grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Power, Wisdom, a new Heart, and the Holy Spirit, and all joyning together, can make them come.

<P>And now before I go any farther, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more particularly enquire into the Nature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an Absolute Promise.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We call that an absolute Promi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>that</HI> is made without any Condition: or m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fully, thus; <HI>that</HI> is an absolute Promise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God, or of Christ, which maketh over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this or <HI>that</HI> Man any saving spiritual I sing, without a Condition to be done on part, for the obtaining thereof. And this have in hand is such an one. Let the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Master of Arts on Earth shew me, if he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any Condition in this Text, depending <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any Qualification in us, which is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same Promise concluded, shall be by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord Jesus effected in us.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> An absolute Promise therefore as we say, without if, or and; that is requireth nothing of us <HI>that</HI> it self might accomplish'd. It saith not, <HI>They shall,</HI> [if] <HI>will</HI>; but, <HI>They</HI> shall: not, They shall, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> use the means; but, They shall. You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="49" REF="003002_0025_0FEF9A79E4D4F480"/>
see <HI>that</HI> a Will, and the use of the Means, is supposed, though not expressed. But I answer, No, by no Means, <HI>that</HI> is as a Condition of this Promise, if they be at all included in the Pro∣mise, they are included there, as the Fruit of the absolute Promise, not as if it expected the Qua∣lification to arise from us. <HI>Thy People shall be wil∣ling in the Day of thy Power, Psal.</HI> 110.3. This is another absolute Promise: But doth that Pro∣mise suppose a Willingness in us, as a Conditi∣on of God's making us willing? They shall be willing, if they are willing; or they shall be Willing if they will be willing. This is ridi∣culous; there is nothing of this supposed. The Promise is absolute as to us, all <HI>that</HI> it engageth for its own accomplishment, is the mighty power of Christ, and his Faithfulness to ac∣complish.</P>
<P>The difference, therefore, betwixt the ab∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lute and conditional Promise is this;</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> They differ in their Terms. The Ab∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lute Promise says, I will and you shall a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other, I will, if you will; or, Do this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thou shalt live, <HI>Jer.</HI> 38.31, 32, 33. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 25. <HI>&amp;c. Heb.</HI> 8.7, 8, 9. <HI>&amp;c. Jer.</HI> 4.1. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.30, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Mat</HI> 19 21.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> They differ in their way of com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nicating good things to Men; the absolute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s communicate things freely, only of Grace; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> other, if there be <HI>that</HI> Qualification in us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Promise calls for, or not else.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The absolute Promises therefore en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e God, the other engages us, I mean God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, us only.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Absolute Promises must be fulfil∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Conditional may, or may not be fulfil∣led.

<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Absolute Promises have therefore sufficiency in themselves, to bring about the own Fulfillings; the Conditional have not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The Absolute Promise is therefore a big-belly Promise, because i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hath in it self a Fulness all desired things for us; and will when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time of <HI>that</HI> Promise is come, yield to us M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>that</HI> which will verily save us; yea, &amp; m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tis capable of answering the Demands of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Promise <HI>that</HI> is Conditional Wherefore thou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there be a real, yea, an eternal D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fference<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these things (wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h others) betwixt the Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tional &amp; Absolute Promise; yet again in o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Respects, there is a blessed Harmony betw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> them; as may be seen in these Particulars.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The Conditional Promise calls for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦pentance, the Absolute gives it, <HI>Acts</HI> 5 30, 31</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Conditional Promise calls▪ Faith, the Absolute Promise gives it, <HI>Zep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 12. <HI>Rom</HI> 15.12.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Conditional Promise calls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> new Heart, the Absolute Promise gives it; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zek</HI> 36.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The Conditional Promise calleth Holy Obedience, the absolute Promise giveth or causeth it, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 37.27.</P>
<P>And as they Harmoniously agree in this▪ again, the Conditional Promise blesseth the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who by the absolute Promise, is endued with Fruit, as for Instance;</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The absolute Promise maketh Men right, and then the Conditional follows, sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="51" REF="003002_0026_0FEF9A7C7A5FE0D0"/>
<HI>Blessed are the Undefiled in the Way; that walketh in the Law of the Lord,</HI> Psalm 119 1.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The absolute Promise giveth to this Man the Fear of the Lord and then the Condi∣tional so loweth, saying. <HI>Blessed is every one that feareth the Lord,</HI> Psa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m 128 1.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The absolute Promise giveth Faith, &amp; then this Conditional follows, saying. <HI>Blessed is be that bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eveth,</HI> Ze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h 3 12 Luke 1 45.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The absolute Promise brings free Forgiveness of Sins; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Condi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ional says, <HI>Blessed are they whose Transgressions are forgiven, and whose sin is covered,</HI> Rom 4 7.8</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> The absolute Promise says, <HI>that</HI> God's Elect shall hold out to the End; then the Con∣ditional follows with this Blessing; <HI>He that shall endure to the End, the same shall he saved, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pet.</HI> 1.4, 5, 6. <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.</P>
<P>Thus do the Promises gloriously serve one another and us, in this their Harmonious A∣greement.</P>
<P>Now the Promise under Consideration is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> absolute Promise; <HI>All that the Father giveth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, shall come to Me.</HI></P>
<P>This Promise therefore, is, as it is said▪ a Big <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly'd Promise, and hath in it self all those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs to bestow upon us, <HI>that</HI> the Conditional <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leth for at our Hands.

<P>Obj. 1. <HI>But they are dead, dead in Trespasses and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; how shall they then come?</HI></P>

He saith not, if they come, or I suppose they will come; but, <HI>and him that cometh.</HI> By these words therefore he shews us <HI>that</HI> he address<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th himself to the receiving of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m whom the Father gave to hims to save them: I say, He addresseth him∣self or prepareth himself to receive them: By which, as I said, He concludeth or buddeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon it, <HI>that</HI> they shall indeed come to Him.

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Christ also suggesteth by these words, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat</HI> He very well knoweth who are given to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im, not by their coming to Him, but by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing gives to Him. <HI>All that the Father giveth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, shall come to me; and him that cometh,</HI> &amp;c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his (Him) He knoweth to be one of them <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at</HI> the Father hath given Him; &amp; therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e receiveth him even because the Father hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ven him to him. <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h</HI> 10 <HI>I know my Sheep,</HI> saith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: Not only those <HI>that</HI> already have know∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ge of Him; but those too <HI>that</HI> yet are igno∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t of Him. <HI>Other Sheep have I,</HI> said He, <HI>that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not of this Fold</HI>: Not of the <HI>Jew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> Church; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se that lie in their Sons, even the rude &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>barous Gentiles.

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Christ by these Words also suggeste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That no more come unto Him than indeed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> given Him of the Father; for the Him in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place is one of the (All) that by Canst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mentioned before.

<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Christ Jesus by these Words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suggesteth, that He is well content with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Father to Him, All that the Father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me, shall come to me; &amp; him that cometh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I will in no wise cast out.

<P><PB N="73" REF="003002_0037_0FEF9AA24CCBCD78"/>They shew us also, that Christ's Love in re∣ceiving, is as large as the Father's Love in giv∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, and no larger. Hence He thanks Him for his Gift; &amp; also thanks Him for hiding of him &amp; his things from the rest of the Wicked, <HI>Mat</HI> 9.25 <HI>Luk.</HI> 10.21.</P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> &amp; more particularly, <HI>And (him) that cometh</HI> And (Him!)

No Sins of the coming Sinner, nor the length of the Time <HI>that</HI> he has abode in them, shall by any means prevail with Jesus Christ to reject him. Co∣ming Sinner, thou art coming to a loving Lord Jesus.</P>
<P>Fourthly, These Words are therefore drop'd from his blessed Mouth, on purpose <HI>that</HI> the co∣ming Sinner might take Encouragement to con∣tinue on his Journey, till he come indeed to Je∣sus Christ. It was doubtless a great Encou∣ragement to blind <HI>Bartimeus,</HI> that Jesus Christ stood still and called him, when he was crying, <HI>Jesus, thou Son of</HI> David, <HI>have me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cy upon me!</HI> Therefore 'tis said, <HI>He cast away his Garment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose up, and came to Jesus,</HI> Mark 10 46, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a Call to come hath such Encouragement in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, what is a Promise of receiving such, but an Encouragement much more?

<P>(<HI>And him that cometh</HI>)</P>
<P>There are two sorts of Sinners that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> coming to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>First, Him <HI>that</HI> hath never, till of late, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all began to come.</P>
<P>Secondly, Him that came formerly, &amp; aft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>that</HI> went back, but hath since bethought him¦self, and is now coming again.</P>

<P>Thy way, O thou Sinner of a double Die, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny Way is open to come to Jesus Christ. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ean thee, whose Heart after long Backsliding, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oes think of turning to him again. Thy way, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> say, is open to him, as is the way of the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rt of Comers, as appears by what follows.</P>
<P>First, Because the Text makes no Exception <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gainst thee: It doth not say, And any Him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut a Backslider, any him but him. The Text <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oes not thus object, but indefinitely opens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide its golden Arms to every coming Soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ithout the least Exception, therefore thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayst come. And take heed <HI>that</HI> thou shut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot <HI>that</HI> Door of Unbelief which God has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pen'd by his Grace.</P>
<P>Secondly, Nay the Text is so far from Ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epting against thy coming, <HI>that</HI> it strongly sug∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esteth, <HI>that</HI> thou art one of the Souls intended. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou coming Backslider; else what need <HI>that</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lauses have been so inserted, <HI>I will in no wise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st out</HI>?

<P>Thirdly, That the Backslider is intended, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evident.</P>
<P>First, For <HI>that</HI> he is sent to by Name, <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sciples, and Peter,</HI> Mark. 16.7. But <HI>Peter</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a godly Man. True but he was also a Bac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣slider, yea, a desperate Backslider. He had a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦med his Master once, twice, thrice, cursing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> swearing <HI>that</HI> he knew him not. If this was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Backsliding, if this was not an high &amp; emine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Backsliding, yea a higher Backsliding than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> art capable of, I have thought amiss.</P>
<P>Again, When <HI>David</HI> had Backslidden, &amp; h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> committed Adultery and Murther in his Bac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sliding, he must be sent to by Name And s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Text, <HI>The Lord sent</HI> Nathan <HI>to</HI> David, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sent him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him after he had brought hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to unfeigned acknowledgment; <HI>The Lord h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> also put away or forgiven thy Sin</HI>; 2 Sam. 1 1.</P>
<P>This Man also was far gone. He took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man's Wife, and kill'd her Husband, &amp; endea¦voured to cover all with wicked Dissimulation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> He did this, I say, after God had exalted him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and shewed him great Favour; wherefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Transgressions was greatned also by the Prophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with mighty Aggravations; yet he was accep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ed, and <HI>that</HI> with gladness, at the first step <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> took in this returning to Christ. For the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> step of the Backslider's return, is to say sensibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and unfeignedly, I have sinned. But he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sooner said thus, but a Pardon was produc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> yea, thrust into his Bosome. <HI>And</HI> Nathan <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> unto</HI> David, <HI>The Lord hath also put away thy Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, As the Person of the Backslider <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="89" REF="003002_0045_0FEF9AC20017F0E8"/>

What sayest now Backslider?</P>
<P>Thirdly, Nay farther, thou are not only men∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ned by Name, and thy Sin by the Nature of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but thou thy self, who art a Returning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cksl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, put</P>
<P>First, Amongst God's Israel: <HI>Return, O back∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ding Israel saith the Lord, and I will not cause my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ger to fall upon you; for I am merciful▪ saith the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd, and will not keep anger for ever,</HI> Jer. 3 12.</P>
<P>Secondly, Thou art put among his Children, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ong his Children to whom he is Married: <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n O backsliding Children, for I an Married <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o you</HI>; Verse 14, 15.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Yea, after all this, as if his Heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s so full of Grace for them, that he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssed until he had utter'd it before them: He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <HI>Return ye backsliding Children, and I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your backsliding.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, Nay further, The Lord hath con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ered, <HI>that</HI> the shame of thy Sin hath stopped <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mouth, and made thee almost a Prayerless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n; and therefore he saith unto thee, <HI>Take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h you words, and turn unto the Lord, and say <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o him, Take away all Iniquity, and receive us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ciously</HI> See his Grace, <HI>that</HI> himself should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Words of Encouragement into the Heart of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ackslider</HI>; as he saith in another place, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght <HI>Ephraim</HI> to go, taking him by the Arms, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> teaching him to go indeed, to hold him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the Arm, by the Chin, as saith <HI>Hosea</HI> 14. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>ch.</HI> 11.3.</P>

Complaint! but the Effect of a more dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judgment! Therefore here is the Mercy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that cometh to Christ, He shall not be le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> wander at Uncertainties.

Him that cometh to Me, I will i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wise Cast out.</P>
<P>Thirdly, To be Cast out, is to be deni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place in God's House, and to be left as Fugi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Vagabonds, to pass a little Time awa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this miserable Life, and after that to go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Dead, <HI>Gal</HI> 4.30. <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.13, 14, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 21:10. Therefore here is the Benefit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that cometh to Christ, He shall not be deni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place in God's House. They shall not be left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vagabonds in the World. Him that com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me, I will in no wise cast out, See <HI>Prov. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Isa.</HI> 56.3, 4. <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2.19, 20. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 22</P>
<P>Fourthly, In a Word, to be cast out, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rejected as are the fallen Angels: For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> eternal Damnation began at their being down from Heaven to Hell. So then not cast out, is to have a Place, a House, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tation there; and to have a share in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ledges of elect Angels.</P>
<P>These Words therefore, I will not cast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will prove great Words one Day, to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come to Jesus Christ, 2. <HI>Peter</HI> 2.4. <HI>John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Luke</HI> 20.35.</P>
<P>Secondly. And more Particularly.</P>
<P>First, Christ hath everlasting Right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to cloath them with, that come to him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall be covered with it as with a Garm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the rest shall be found in the filthy Rags <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own stinking Pollutions, and shall be w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in them as in a Winding Sheet, and so be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hirdly. Christ hath precious Blood, that like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> open Fountain, stands free for him to wash in, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at comes to him for Life. And he will in no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se cast him out. But they that come not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, are rejected from a share therein, and are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to ireful Vengeance for their Sins, <HI>Zech.</HI> 13 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.11, 19 <HI>John</HI> 13 8 chap. 3, 36.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Christ hath precious Promises, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey shall have a share in them that come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m for Life. For he will in no wise cast them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t: but they that come not, can have no share <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, because they are true only in him: For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him, and only in him, all the Promises are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea and Amen. Wherefore they that come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>to</HI> him are no whit the better for them, <HI>Psal.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 16. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.20, 21.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Christ hath also fulness of Grace in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mself, for them that come unto him for Life. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d he will in no wise cast them out. But those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come not unto him, are left in their grace∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> State, &amp; as Christ leaves them, Death, Hell▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judgment finds them.

and Compassion for those that come to him: For he will in no wise cast them out.

<P>Eighthly, Christ is known by, &amp; for who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sake, those <HI>that</HI> come to him, have their Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sons and Performances accepted of the F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ther: And he will in no wise cast them out B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the rest must fly to the Rocks &amp; Mountai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for shelter, but all in vain, to hide them fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Face and Wrath, <HI>Rev.</HI> 6.15.</P>
<P>But again, These Words (<HI>cast out</HI>) have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> special Look to what will be hereafter eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> at the Day of Judgment For then, and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> till then, will be the great Anathema a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Casting out, made manifest, even manifest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Execution. Therefore here to speak as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this, and <HI>that</HI> under these two Heads. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. Or the casting out it self.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of the Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> into which they shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cast, that shall then be cast out.</P>
<P>First, The Casting out it self standeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Two Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. In a Preparatory Work.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the Manner of executing the Act</P>
<P>The Preparatory Work standeth in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Three Things.</P>
<P>First, It standeth in their Separation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have not come to him, from them that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at that Day.

And good Reason; for since they would not with us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one to him, now they have Time; why should they stand with us, when Judg∣ment is come</P>
<P>Secondly, They shall be placed before him according to their Condition; they <HI>that</HI> have come to him in great dignity, even at the <HI>Right</HI> Hand, for He will in no wise cast 'em <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut: But the rest shall be set at his Left <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and; the place of Disgrace and Shame; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey did not come to him for Life.</P>
<P>Distinguish'd also shall they be by fit Terms. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose <HI>that</HI> come to him he calleth Sheep, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e rest are frowish Goats.

<P>Thirdly, Then will Christ proceed to Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ion of those <HI>that</HI> came not unto him; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill say, <HI>I was a Stranger, and ye took me not in, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not come unto me.</HI> Their Excuse of them∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ves▪ he will slight as Dirt, and proceed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir final Judgment Now, when these wretch∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Rejecters of Christ, shall thus be set before

<P>Secondly, The Father hath left it with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to quicken whom he will, <HI>viz.</HI> with s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Grace, and to cast out whom he will, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rebellion against him, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5 21.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Father hath made him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Quick and Dead, <HI>hath committed all Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the Son, and appointed that all should honou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Son, even as they honour the Father,</HI> Joh. 22 5.</P>
<P>Fourthly, God will Judge the World by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man; the day is appointed for Judgment, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he is appointed for Judge. <HI>He hath appoin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> day in the which he will Judge the world with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦teousness by that Man,</HI> Acts 17 31, 32.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore we must all appear before the Judg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Seat of Christ: that every one may receive fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> things done in the Body, according to what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> done.</HI> If they have closed with him, Heave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Salvation; if they have not, Hell and Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion.</P>
<P>And for these Reasons he must be Judge.</P>
<P>First, Because of his Humiliation, becaus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Father's Word he humbled himself, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> became obedient unto Death, even the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Cross; Therefore God hath highly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> alted him, and given him a Name above e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Name, that at the Name of Jesus every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall bow; both of things in Heaven &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on Earth, and things under the Earth; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>every</HI> Tongue should confess, Jesus Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</P>

<P>These Observations lie all of them in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> words, and are plentifully confirmed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Scriptures of Truth; but I shall not at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time speak to them all, but shall pass by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first, second, third, fourth and sixth part, be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I design brevity, and partly because they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> touch'd upon, in the Explicatory part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Text. I shall therefore begin with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Observation, and so make that the first i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦der, in the following Discourse.</P>
<P>First then, coming to Christ is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Will, Wisdom or Power of Man, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gift, Promise, and drawing of the Father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Observation consisteth of two Parts.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That coming to Christ is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Will, Wisdom, or power of Man.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="003002_0060_0FEF9AEF4C15DF40"/>Secondly, But by the Gilt, Promise, and draw∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g of the Father.</P>
<P>That the Text carrieth this Truth in its Bo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, you will find it if you look into the Expli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ion of the first part thereof before. I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>refore here follow the method propounded, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shew, tha First coming to Christ it not by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Wisdom, or Power of Man: This is true, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ause the Word doth positively say, it is not.</P>
<P>First, It denieth it to be holy by the Will of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. Not of Blood nor of the Will of the Flesh, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the will of man.

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>econdly, It denieth it to be the Wisdom of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, is manifest from these Considerations.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> In the Wisdom of God it pleased him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the World by Wisdom would not know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Now if by their Wisdom they cannot know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it follows by that Wisdom, that they can∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come unto him; for coming to him is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ore, but after some knowledge of him, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Acts</HI> 13.2. <HI>Psal.</HI> 9 10.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Wisdom of Man, in God's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ount, as to the Knowledge of Christ is reck∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Foolishness: Hath not God made foolish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wisdom of this World And again, The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dom of this World, is Foolishness with God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God hath made Foolish the Wisdom of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> World; and again, If the Wisdom of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld is foolishness with him, then verily it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely, that by that, a sinner should become <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dent as to come to Jesus Christ; especially, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consider,</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>dly, That the Doctrine of a crucified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and so of Salvation by him, is the very
<PB N="118" REF="003002_0061_0FEF9AF2AE48B1A0"/>
thing that is counted Foolishness by the Wisdo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the World. Now if the very Doctrine of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> crucified Christ be counted Foolishness by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wisdom of this World it cannot be▪ that by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wisdom a Man should be drawn out in his Sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that comes to him, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.20. <HI>Chap.</HI> 2.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Chap.</HI> 3.19. <HI>Chap</HI> 1.28, 29.</P>
<P>Fourthly, God counted the Wisdom of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> World one of the greatest enemies, therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Wisdom no Man can come to Jesus Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> For it is not likely that one of God's great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Enemies, should draw a Man to that which b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of all pleaseth God, as coming to Christ do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Now that God counteth the Wisdom of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> World one of his greatest Enemies, is evide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></P>
<P>First, For <HI>that</HI> it casteth the greatest conten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon his Son's Undertaking, as afore is prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> In <HI>that</HI> he counts his Crucifixion Foolishne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Tho' <HI>that</HI> be one of the highest Demonstratio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of divine Wisdom, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.7, 8.</P>
<P>Secondly, Because God hath threatned to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦stroy it, and bring it to nought, &amp; cause th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to close with Jesus Christ. <HI>Isa.</HI> 29 14 <HI>Cor</HI> 1.19.</P>
<P>Thirdly, He hath rejected it from helping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Ministry of his Word, as a fruitless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ness, and a thing <HI>that</HI> cometh to no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.4, 12.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Because it causeth to perish, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>that</HI> seek it, and pursue it, 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 2.18.</P>
<P>Fifthly, And God has proclaimed, <HI>that</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man will be wise in this World, he mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>fool</HI> in the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of this World, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>way</HI> to be wise in the wisdom of God. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>man will be wise in this world, let him become <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that he may be wise, for the wisdom of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is foolishness with God,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.18.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="003002_0061_0FEF9AF2AE48B1A0"/>Sixthly, Coming to Christ is not by the Pow∣er of man This is evident, partly</P>
<P>First, From <HI>that which goeth before</HI> For man's Power in the putting forth of it in this matter, is either stirred up by Love, or sense of Neces∣sity; but the Wisdom of this World neither gives man Love to, or a Sense of a Need of J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus Christ, therefore his Power lie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> still, as from that.</P>
<P>Secondly, What Power has he <HI>that</HI> is dead, (as every natural man is) even spiritually dead in Trespasses and Sins; dead, even as dead to God's New Testament things, as he <HI>that</HI> is in his Grave, dead to the things of this world; what Power <HI>hath he then</HI> where∣by to come to Jesus Christ? <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.25. <HI>Eph.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.13.</P>
<P>Thirdly, God forbids the mighty man's Glo∣ry in his Strength, &amp; says positively, by strength shall no man prevail; and again Not by might, nor by power but my Spirit, saith the Lord▪ <HI>Jer.</HI> 9.23, 24. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 2.2. <HI>Zech</HI> 4, 6. 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 27 28.</P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>Paul</HI> acknowledges, that Man, na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> converted Man, of himself, has not a suffi∣ciency of Power in himself, to think a good thought if not to do that which is least; for to think it less than to come, then no man by his own power can come to Je∣sus Christ, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.5.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Hence we are said to be made wi∣lling to come by the Power of God, to be rain'd from a state of Sin, to a state of Grace, by the Power of God; and to believe, <HI>that</HI> is, to even through the exceeding Workings of his migh∣ty Power, <HI>Psal.</HI> 11.1 <HI>Col.</HI> 2.11. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.18, 20 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee also <HI>Job.</HI> 49.14.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="003002_0062_0FEF9AF465B28B10"/>But this needed not, of either Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Power or Will to come; or so much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦ciously to think of being willing to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> (of themselves) to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>I should now come to the Proof of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> second part of the Observation, but that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> occasionally done already, in the Explicat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Part of the Text, to which I refer the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣der; for I shall here only give thee a T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or two more to the same Purpose, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come to the Use and Application.</P>

<P>Thirdly, Again, it is written in the Pro¦phets, <HI>They shall be all taught of God, every o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore that hath heard, and learned of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, cometh to me,</HI> John 6.45.</P>
<P>I shall not enlarge, but make some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Application, and so come to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Observation.</P>
<P>First Is it so? Is coming to Jesus Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not by the Will, Wisdom, or Power of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but by the Gift, Promise, and drawing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Father? Then they are to blame that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Will, Wisdom, and power of Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngs sufficient to bring Men to Christ.</P>
<P>There are some Men who think they may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot be contradicted when they plead for the Will, Wisdom, and Power of Man in Refe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence to the things <HI>that</HI> are of the Kingdom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Christ: But I will say to such a man, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever yet came to understand that himself is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the Scripture teacheth concerning him: Neither did he ever know, what coming to Christ is, by the Teaching Gift, and drawing of the Father. He is such a one <HI>that</HI> hath set up God's Enemy in Opposition to him, and <HI>that</HI> continueth in such Acts of Defiance; and what his End without a New Birth will be, the Scriptures teach also: But we will pass this.</P>
<P>Secondly, Is it so? Is coming to Jesus Christ, by the Gift, Promise, and drawing of the Fa∣ther, then let Saints here learn to ascribe their coming to Christ, to the Gift, Promise &amp; draw∣ing of the Father. Christian Man, bless God who hath given thee to Jesus Christ, by Pro∣mise; and again, bless God for <HI>that</HI> he hath drawn thee to him. And why is it thee? Why not another? O <HI>that</HI> the Glory of Electing Love should rest upon thy Head, and <HI>that</HI> the Glory of the Exceeding Grace of God should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake hold of thy Heart, and bring thee to Jesus Christ</P>
<P>Thirdly, Is it so? That coming to Christ is by the Father as afore said? Then this should teach us to set a high esteem upon them th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are indeed coming to Jesus Christ; I say no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign esteem on them for the sake of him, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of whose Grace they are made to come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jesus Christ.</P>

<P>Thus I might go on to the end of things, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shew you <HI>that</HI> still this Promise was provided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> answer all Objections, and doth answer them▪ But, I say, What need it be, if they <HI>that</HI> are coming to Jesus Christ, are not sometimes, yea▪ oftentimes heartily afraid, <HI>that</HI> Jesus Christ will cast them out?</P>
<P>I will give you now two Instances, <HI>that</HI> seem to imply the Truth of this Observation.</P>
<P>In the Ninth of <HI>Matthew</HI> at the second Verse, you Read of a Man <HI>that</HI> was sick of the Palsie; and he was coming to Jesus Christ, being borne upon a Bed by his F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iends. He also was co∣ming himself, and <HI>that</HI> upon another Account than any of his Friends were aware of even for the Pardon of sins, and the Salvation of his Soul. Now, so soon as even he was come into the Presence of Christ▪ Christ bids him be of good Cheer. It seems then his Heart was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inting: But what was the cause of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="135" REF="003002_0069_0FEF9B0AE5C95ED0"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inting? Not his bodily Infirmity, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re of which his Friends did bring him to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rist, but the Guilt and Burden of his sins; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the pardon of which, himself did come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n; therefore he proceeds <HI>Be of good Cheer, thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be forgiven thee.</HI></P>
<P>I say, Christ saw him sinking in his Mind, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut how it would go with his most noble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt; And therefore first he applies himself to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m on <HI>that</HI> account. For, though his Friends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Faith enough as to the Cure of his Body, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he himself had little enough, as to the cure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his Soul. Therefore Christ takes him up as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man falling down, saying, <HI>Son be of good chear, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y sins be forgiven thee.</HI></P>
<P>That about the Prodigal, seems pertinent also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>this</HI> matter, when he was come to himself, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e said, <HI>How many hired Servants</HI> of <HI>my Father have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enough, and to spare, and I perish for Hunger? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will arise now, and go to my Father.</HI> Heartily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>poken. But how did he perform his Promi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s; I think not so well as he promised to do: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd my ground for my thoughts is, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Father, so soon as he was come to him, fell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon his Neck, and kissed him; implying, me∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hinks, as if the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>digal by this time was de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cted in his mind; and therefore his Father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves him the most sudden and familiar Token <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Reconciliation.</P>
<P>And Kisses were of Old Time often used to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> move Doubts and Fears.

<P>Quest. <HI>But what should be the Reason</HI>?</P>
<P>I will answer to this Question thus.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is not for want of the revealed Will of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od, <HI>that</HI> manifested Grounds for the contra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for of <HI>that</HI> there was a Sufficiency; yea, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ext it self hath lain a sufficient Foundation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Encouragement for them <HI>that</HI> are coming to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esus Christ.</P>
<P><HI>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is not for want of an Invitation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o come, for <HI>that</HI> is full and plain, <HI>Come unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e all ye that Labour, and are heavy laden, and I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you rest,</HI> Mat. 11 28.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> It is not for want of a solemn Oath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Ingagement to save them <HI>that</HI> come; For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecause he could swear by no greater, He swore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y himself. <HI>That by two immutable things, in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was impossibble that God should lye, we might have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trong Consolation, who have fled▪ for refuge, to lay hold on the hope set before us,</HI> Heb 6.15, 16, 17, 19.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Neither is it for want of great Ex∣amples of God's Mercy, <HI>that</HI> have come to Je∣sus Christ, of which we read most plentifully in the word.</P>
<P>Therefore it must be concluded, it was for want of <HI>that</HI> which follows.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is for want of Knowledge in Christ. Thou knowest but little of the Grace &amp; Kind∣ness <HI>that</HI> is in the Heart of Christ Thou knowest but little of the Merit and Virtue of his Blood.

Thou knowest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> little of the Willingness <HI>th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> is in his heart to save thee: And this is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reason of the Fear that ariseth in thy Heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> causeth th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to doubt▪ <HI>that</HI> Christ will not r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ceive thee Unbelief is the Daughter of Ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦rance: Therefore Christ saith, <HI>O Fools and slow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heart to believe</HI> Luke 24 25.</P>
<P>Slowness of Heart to believe flows from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Foolishness in the things of Christ; This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> evident to all <HI>that</HI> are acquainted with the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦selves, and are seeking after Jesus Christ: T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more Ignorance, the more Unbelief; the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Knowledge of Christ, the more faith. <HI>They th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> know thy Name, will put their trust in thee,</HI> Psal. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 10.

<P>And it is a Wonder then to see a Soul that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> drowned in the sense of Glory, and a sense of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own Nothingness, to be confounded in it self, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to fear that the Glory apprehended, is too grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too good, and too rich for such an one.</P>
<P>That thing, Heaven and eternal Glory, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great, and I that would have it so small, so sor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Creature, that the Thoughts of obtaining it co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦founds me.</P>
<P>Thus I say, doth the greatness of the things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fired, quite dash and overthrow the Minds of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desire: Oh, it is too big! it is too big! it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat a Mercy,</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="003002_0074_0FEF9B19B7F6BC88"/>But, Coming Sinner, let me reason with thee▪ Thou-say'st it is too big, too great. Well, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings that are less satisfie thy Soul; will a less <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing than Heaven, than Glory and eternal Life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nswer thy Desires?

No not too big for God to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reely, be content, let God give like Himself; He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Eternal God, &amp; giveth like Himself.

Now God is a great King, let him give like a King, nay let him give himself, and do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hou receive like thy self. He hath all, &amp; thou hast nothing God told his People of old▪ that he would save them in Truth and Righteousness, &amp; that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould return to, and enjoy the Land, which before for their Sins had spued them out. And then adds under a Supposition of their counting the Mercy too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ood or too big. <HI>Is it he marvell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us in the Eyes of the Remnant of this People in</HI> these <HI>Days, should it</HI> also <HI>be marvellous in mine Eyes?</HI> saith <HI>the Lord of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts,</HI> Zech. 8 9,</P>

I will do for them like God, if they all but receive my Bounty like Sinners.</P>
<P>Coming Sinner, God can give his heavenly Cana∣an, and the Glory of it to thee: yea none ever had them, but as a Gift, a free Gift. He has given us his Son, How shall he not them, with him freely give us all things?</P>
<P>It was not the worthiness of Abraham, Moses, or David, or Peter, or Paul, but the Mercy of God that made them Inheritors of Heaven. If God thinks thee worthy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dge not thy self unworthy, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> take it, and be thankful.

he intends to give thee, if he has drawn out t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> heart to ask.

<P>When God is said to incline his Ear, it implies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Intention to bestow the Mercy desired.

Psal. 113 7, 8.</P>
<P>You see also, when God made a Wedding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Son, he called not the Great, nor the Rich, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Mighty▪ but the Poor▪ the Maimed▪ the Halt▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Blind, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22 <HI>Luke</HI> 14</P>

<P>There are two things among many, that Satan useth to roar out after them that are coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="1">1. That they are not Elected, Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. That they have▪ sinned the Sin against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Holy Ghost.</P>
<P>To both these I answer briefly.</P>
<P N="1">Touching Election, out of which thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou art excluded.

<P>First, That coming to Christ, is by Virt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Gift, Promise, and Drawing of the Father; In thou act a coming, therefore God hath given that

But that would not be if it were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by Promise, and Drawing to Christ by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Father</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>condly, Jesus Christ hath Promised, That him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cometh to him, he will in no wise cast out, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if he hath said it, will he not make it good. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> even thy Salvation? For as I have said al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, not to cast out, is to receive and admit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fit of Salvation. If then the Father has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n thee, as is manifested by thy coming and if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ist will receive thee▪ thou coming Soul, as 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, be cause he hath said. He well in no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e cast thee out. Then be confident▪ &amp; let those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nclusions that as naturally flow from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Light from the Sun, or Water from the Foun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n stay thee.</P>
<P><HI>If</HI> Satan therefore objecteth, But thou art not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected; answer, But I am coming, Satan, I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ming; and that I could not be, but that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther draws; and I am coming to such a Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sus as will in no wise cast me out. Farther, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tan, were I not the Elect, the Father would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w me; nor would the Son so graciously open <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Bosome to me. I am persawded that not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of the Non-elect shall ever be able to say <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o not in the Day of Judgment) I did sincerely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome to Jesus Christ, Come they may, feignedly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Judas</HI> and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mon Magus</HI> did; but that is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Question. Therefore O thou honest-hearted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ming Sinner! be not afraid, but come.</P>
<P>As to the second Part of the Objection about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing that Sin against the Holy Ghost; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Argument also overthrows that also. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will argue thus.</P>
<P>First, Coming to Christ is by virtue of a spe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gift of the Father; but the Father giveth
<PB N="148" REF="003002_0076_0FEF9B22B6E03F90"/>
no such Gift to them that have sinned that Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore thou that art coming hast not co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦mitted that Sin that the Father giveth no su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Gift to them that have sinned that Sin is evide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></P>
<P N="1">1. Because they have sinned themselves out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God's Favour; they shall never have forgi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ness, <HI>Mat</HI> 12 32. But it is a special Favour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God to give unto a Man, to come to Jes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Christ; because thereby he obtaineth Forgi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ness Therefore he that cometh, hath not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ned that Sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. They that have sinned the Sin against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost, have sinned themselves out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> interest in the sacrifice of Christ's Body &amp; Blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> There remains for such no more sacrifice for S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></P>
<P>But God giveth not G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace to any of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to Christ, that have no share in the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦crifice of his B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy and Blood; Therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that art coming to him, hast not sinned th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sin, <HI>Heb.</HI> 19 26.</P>
<P>Secondly, Coming to Christ, is by the specia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> drawing of the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her. <HI>No man cometh to M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> except the Father wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch hath sent me draw him.</HI> But the Father draweth not him to Christ fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whom he hath not allotted Forgiveness by hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Blood. Therefore, they that are coming to Je¦sus Christ, have not sinned that Sin, because he hath allotted them Forgiveness by his Blood▪ <HI>John</HI> 6.44.</P>
<P>That the Father cannot draw them to Jesu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ, for whom he hath not allotted Forgive¦ness of Sin, is manifest to Sense; for that wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be a plain Mockery, a Flam neither becomi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his Wisdom, Justice, Holiness, nor Goodness.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Coming to Jesus Christ, lays a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> under his Intercession: For he ever liveth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="149" REF="003002_0076_0FEF9B22B6E03F90"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke Intercession for them that come, <HI>Heb</HI> 7.25. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herefore he that is coming to Jesus Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nnot have sinned that Sin</P>
<P>Christ has forbidden the People to Pray for them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at have sinned that Sin, &amp; therefore will not Pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r them himself, but he prays for them that come.</P>
<P>Fourthly, He that hath sinned that Sin Christ is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o him of no more Worth, than it a Man that is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead. For he hath crucified to him the Son of God▪ Yea, &amp; hath also counted his precious Blood as an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nholy thing <HI>Heb</HI> 6 10. Now he that hath this low <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>steem of Christ, will never come to him for Life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the Coming Man has an high Esteem of his Per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, Blood and Merits. Therefore he that is coming has not committed that Sin.</P>
<P>Fifthly, If he that hath sinned this Sin might yet come to Jesus Christ then must the truth of God be overthrown, which saith in one place. He hath never Forgiveness. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n another, I will in no <HI>wise</HI> cast out. Therefore that he may never have Forgiveness, he shall never have an Heart to come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Jesus Christ. It is impossible that such an one should be renewed either to, or by Repentance▪ <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. Wherefore, never trouble thy Head nor Heart a∣bout this matter. He that cometh to Jesus Christ, cannot have sinned against the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Thy Fears that Christ will not receive thee, may arise from thine own Folly, in inventing yea, in the chalking out to God a way to bring thee Home to Jesus Christ. Some Souls that are coming to Jesus Christ are great Tormentors of themselves upon this account. They conclude, that if their coming to Jesus Christ is right, they must needs be brought home thus and thus. As to instance.</P>
<P N="1">1. Says one, if God be bringing of me to Jesus Christ, then will he load me with the Guilt of Sin, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>till he make me roar again.</P>
<P N="2">2. If God be indeed bringing me home to Jesus Christ, then must I be assaulted with dreadful Temptations of the Devil.</P>
<P N="3">3. If God be indeed a bringing me to Jesus
<PB N="150" REF="003002_0077_0FEF9B268A6B2CE0"/>
Christ then even when I come at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I shall n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wonderful Revelations of him.</P>
<P>This is the way that some Sinners appoint <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God. But perhaps he will not walk herein, et he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the unto Jesus Christ. But now because t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come not in the way of their own chalking o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore they are at a loss. They look for a h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦vy lord and burthen; but perhaps God gives th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a sight of their lost Condition and addeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that heavy weight and burthen. They look for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fearful Temptations of Satan but God sees t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet they are not fit for them? Nor is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come, that he should be honoured by them in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Condition. They look for Great and Glorio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Revelations of Christ, Grace, and Mercy. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perhaps God only takes the Yoke from off the Jaws, and lays Meat before them. And now age they are at a Loss yet a coming to Christ: I dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> (saith God) with the Cords of a Man, with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bands of Love: I took the Yoke from of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Jaws, and said Meat unto them, <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.14.</P>
<P>Now I say, if God brings thee to Christ, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the way that thou hast appointed, then th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> art a loss; and for thy being at a loss thou may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thank thy self, God hath more ways than tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> knowest of, to bring a Sinner to Jesus Christ.

<P>There is a Man of an ill favour'd Countenance, who hath too high a Conceit of his Beauty; and wanting the Benefit of a Glass, he still stands in his own Conceit▪ at last a Limner is sent unto him, who draweth his ill favoured Face to the Life; now looking on it▪ he begins to be convinc'd, that he is not half so Handsome as he thought he was. Co∣ming Sinner, thy Temptations are these Painters, they have drawn out thy ill favour'd Heart to the Life, and have set it before thine Eyes, and now thou seest how ill favour'd thou art.</P>
<P><HI>Hezekiah</HI> was a good Man, yet when he lay Sick (for ought I know) he had somewhat too good an Opinion of his Heart, and for ought I know also, the Lord might upon his Recovery, leave him to a Temptation, that he might better know all that was in his Heart. Compare, Isa. 38.1. <HI>Chron.</HI> 32 31.</P>
<P>Alas▪ We are sinful out of measure, but see it not to the full, until an Hour of Temptation comes, but when it comes it doth as the Painter doth, it draweth out our Heart to the Life. Yet the sight of what we are, should not keep us from coming to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>There are two Ways by which God sets a Man into a sight of the Naughtiness of his Heart, one is, by the light of the Word and Spirit of God: &amp; the other is, by the Temptations of the Devil. But by the first, we see our Naughtiness one way, and by the second, another. By the light of the Word, and Spirit of God, thou hast a sight of thy naughtiness, and by the Light of the Sun thou hast a sight of the

And these things keep me from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ming to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Look ye now! Did not I tell ye so? There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thoughts yet remaining in the Heart, even of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who have forsaken their wicked Ways: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those Thoughts they are more plagued, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any thing else? because they hinder their co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Jesus Christ. For the Sin of Unbelief, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Original of all these Thoughts, is that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> besets a coming Sinner more easily than doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ways, Heb. 12.1, 2, 3 4.</P>
<P>But now, since Jesus Christ commands thee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forsake these Thoughts▪ forsake them, coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ner: and if thou forsake them not, thou transg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lest the Commands of Christ▪ &amp; abidest thine o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tormentor, and keepest thy self from the Es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦blishment in Grace. If ye will not believe, <HI>ye</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not be established, Isa. 7.9.</P>
<P>Thus you see how Jesus Christ setteth himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦gainst such Thoughts, that any way discourage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coming Sinner: and thereby truly vindicates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Doctrine we have in Hand? to wit, That Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Christ would not have them that in Truth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coming to him, once think, that He will cast th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out.

<DIV2 TYPE="reasons">
<HEAD>I come now to the Reasons of the <HI>Observation.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IF Jesus Christ would allow thee Once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Think, that he will cast thee out; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must allow thee to think, that he will falsify <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Word: For he hath said, I will in no wise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out. But Christ would not that thou should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> account him as one, that will falsify his W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> For he saith of himself, I am the Truth.

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If Jesus Christ should allow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="165" REF="003002_0084_0FEF9B3C62693058"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner that in Truth is coming to him Once to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nk, that he will cast him out; then he must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow, and so countenance the first appearance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Unbelief; which he counteth his greatest Ene∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, &amp; against which he has bent even his Holy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>spel. Therefore Jesus Christ would not, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey that in Truth are coming to him should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce think, that he will cast them out: Sea <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t.</HI> 14.31. <HI>Mark</HI> 11.13. <HI>Luke</HI> 24.25.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> If Jesus Christ should allow the com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g Sinner once to think that he will cast him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et; then he must allow him to make a Quest∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, wether he is willing to recieve his Father's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ift?

<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> If Jesus Christ should allow them once to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ink (that indeed are coming to him) that he will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st him out, he must allow them to think▪ that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill despise and reject the Drawing of the Father. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r no man can come to him, but whom the Father Draweth. But it would be high Blasphemy &amp; dam∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble Wickedness once to imagine thus.

<P><HI>Fifthly</HI> If Jesus Christ should allow those that in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed are coming to him, once to think that he will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast them out, he must allow them to think, that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill be unfaithful to the Trust and Charge that his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther hath committed to him, which is to Save▪ &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t to Lose any thing of that which he hath give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im to save▪ <HI>John</HI> 6.3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>But the Father hath given him a charge to save <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he coming sinner: therefore it cannot be that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ould all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that such should once think that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll cast him out.</P>

Therefore not once to think, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the coming Sinner shall be cast out.</P>
<P N="1">1. He cannot allow us to Question his Will; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he saith in the Text, <HI>I will in no wise cast out</HI></P>

<P>Secondly What is he that cometh to Jesus Christ</P>
<P N="1">1. He is counted one of God's Enemies▪ <HI>Luk.</HI> 19 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>

He is a Child of the Devil and of Hell so th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Devil begat him, as to his sinful Nature▪ and He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must swallow him at last, because he cometh no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Jesus Christ <HI>John</HI> 8.44.</P>

<P>But Secondly, This Doctrine of coming to Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> informeth us, Where poor destitute Sinners ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> find Life for their Souls, and that is in Christ.

<P>Now for farther enlargement, I will also h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> propound three more Questions.</P>

<ITEM><PB N="169" REF="003002_0086_0FEF9B428021A160"/>2. Who may have it?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Upon what Terms?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><HI>First,</HI> What Life is in Jesus Christ?</P>
<P N="1">1. There is Justifying Life in Christ: Man by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n is Dead in Law, and Christ only can deliver <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em, by his Righteousness &amp; Blood from this Death, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto a state of Life. For God sent his Son into the World, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we might live through him, 1 <HI>John</HI> 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That is, thro' the Righteousness which he should accomplish, and the Death that he should Die.</P>
<P N="2">2 There is Eternal Life in Christ, Life tha'ts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndless: and this Life is in his son▪ 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.</P>
<P>Now Justification eternal Salvation being both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Christ, and no where else to be had for Men, who would not come to <HI>Jesus Christ?</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Who may have this Life?</HI></P>
<P>I answer, poor, helpless, miserable Sinners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>articularly.</P>
<P N="1">1. Such as are willing to have it: Whosoever will let him take the Waters of Life, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.17.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>He</HI> that thirsteth for it let them take the Wa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of Life f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eely; I will give to him that is a thirst of the Fountain of the Waters of Life. <HI>Rev.</HI> 21.6.</P>
<P N="3">3, <HI>He</HI> that is weary of his Sins. This is the rest whereby you may cause the the weary to rest, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd this is the refreshing, <HI>Isa.</HI> 28 12</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>He</HI> that is poor and needy. <HI>He</HI> shall spare the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oor &amp; needy, &amp; shall save the Souls of the needy</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>He</HI> that followeth after him▪ cryeth for Life: <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> that follows me, shall not walk in Darkness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t shall have the Light of Life, <HI>John</HI> 8.12.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Upon what Terms may he have this Life;</P>
<P><HI>Ans</HI> Freely, Sinner dost t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou hear? Thou may'st <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave it freely: I will give him of the Fountain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Water of Life Freely; And when they had no∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing to pay, he frankly forgave them both <HI>Luk.</HI> 7.</P>
<P><HI>Freely,</HI> without Money, or without Price. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>!
<PB N="170" REF="003002_0087_0FEF9B474BE307A0"/>
Eevery one that thirsteth, come ye to the Waters &amp; that hath no Money, come, buy; &amp; eat; Yea come <HI>buy Wine &amp; Milk, without Money &amp; without Price</HI> Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 55.1</P>
<P><HI>Sinner,</HI> Art thou Thirsty? Art thou Weary? Art thou Willing? come then, &amp; regard not your Stuff, for all the good that is in Christ, is offered to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Coming Sinner, without Money, &amp; without Price <HI>He</HI> has Life to give away to such as want it, &amp; that have not a Penny to Purchase it, &amp; he will give it freely. Oh, what a blessed Condition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the coming Sinner in.</P>
<P><HI>But Thirdly,</HI> This Doctrine of Coming to <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> for Life, informeth us, That it is to be had no where else; might it be had any where else? the Text and him that spake it, would be but little set by; for what greater matter is there, in I will in no wise cast out, if another stood by that would receive them? But here appears the Glory of Christ, that none but he can save And here appears his Love, that though none can save but <HI>He,</HI> yet he is not Coy in Saving; But him that comes to me sayshel will in no wise cast him out</P>
<P>That none can save but <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> is evident from <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. Neither is there Salvation in any other; and he hath given us Eternal Life, &amp; this Life is in his Son. If Life could have been had any where else it should have been in the Law, no man living shall be justified; and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not justified, then no Life.</P>
<P>Therefore Life is no where to be had but in <HI>Jesus Christ, Gal.</HI> 3.</P>
<P><HI>Qu.</HI> But why would God so order it, that Life should be had no where else, but in <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> There is reason for it, and that with respect to God and us</P>
<P>First. <HI>With respect to God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="003002_0087_0FEF9B474BE307A0"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst, That it might be in way of Justice, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as Mercy. And in a way of Justice it could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have been if it had not been by Christ, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and he only, was able to answer the Demand of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Law; and give for Sin, what the Justice there∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> required. All Angels had been Crushed down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hell for ever, had that Curse been laid upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em for our Sins, which was laid upon Jesus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrist, but 'twas laid upon him, and he bare it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d answered the Penalty, and redeemed his Peo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e from under it with that satisfaction to Divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stice, that God himself doth now proclaim, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut he is faithful and just to forgive us, if by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith we shall venture to Jesus, and trust to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he has done for Life, <HI>Rom</HI> 3.24, 25, 26. <HI>Joh.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.9.</P>
<P>Secondly, Life must be by Jesus Christ, that God might be adored and magnified, for finding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut the Way. This is the Lord's doings, that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll things he might be glorified through Jesus Christ our Lord.</P>
<P>Thirdly, It must be by Jesus Christ, that Life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight be at God's dispose who hath great Pity for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Poor, the Lowly, the Meek, the Broken in heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd for them that others care not for, <HI>Psal.</HI> 34 6.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Life must be in Christ to cut off Boas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing from the Lips of Men. This also is the Apo∣stle's Reason, <HI>Rom</HI> 3.20, 27.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Life must be in Jesus Christ, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>espect to us.</P>
<P>First, That we might have it upon the easiest Terms, to wit Freely; as a Gift, not as Wages: was it in Moses's hand, we should come hardly at it. Was it in the Pope's hand, we should pay soundly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or it. But thanks be to God, it is in Christ laid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p in him, and by him to be communicated to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ners upon easie Terms, even so receiving, ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pting▪ and embracing with Thanksgiving, as the Scripture plainly declare, <HI>Job.</HI> 1.11.</P>
<P>Secondly, Life is in Christ for us, that it might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at be upon so b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ttle a Foundation, as indeed it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been any where else. The Law it
<PB N="172" REF="003002_0088_0FEF95F3E47ECDD0"/>
self is weak, because of us to this; but Christ is tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ed Stone, a sure founda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion one that will not fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to bear thy Burthen, and to receive thy Soul, com¦ing Sinner.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Life is in Christ, that it might be su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be the Seed. Alas! the best of us▪ was Life lef<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in our hands▪ to be sure we should forfeit it, over and over, and over. Or, was it in any other hand we should by our often Backsliding so offend him▪ that at last he would shut up his Bowels in ever∣lasting Displeasure against us. But now it is in Christ it is with one that can pity, pray for Pardon yea▪ multiply Pardons. It is with one that can have Compassion upon us, when we are out of the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ with one that hath an heart to fetch us again when we are gone astray: with one that can Par∣don without upbraiding. Blessed be God that Life is in Christ! For now 'tis sure to all the Seed.</P>
<P>But Fourthly. This Doctrine of coming to Jesus Christ for Life, informs us of the Evil of Unbelief, that wicked thing that is the only, or chief hin∣drance to the coming Sinner▪ Doth the Text say, Come? Doth it say, And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out? Then what an Evil is that keepeth Sinners from coming to Jesus Christ? And that Evil is Unbelief. For by Faith we come. By Unbelief we keep away. Therefore it is said to be that, by which a Soul is said to depart from God, because it was that which at first caused the World to go off from him▪ and that also that keeps them from him to this day, And it doth it the more eastly, because it doth it with a Wile.</P>
<P>This Sin may be called, The White Devil, for it oftentimes in its mischievous doing in the Soul shews as it was an Angel of Light, yet it acteth like a Counsellor of Heaven. Therefore, a little to D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣course of this Disease.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is that Sin, above all others that hath some shew of Reasons in its Attempts. For it keeps the Soul from Christ, by pretending its present un∣fitness and unpreparedness, as want of more sense of Sin, want of more Repentance, want of more Hu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ility,
<PB N="173" REF="003002_0088_0FEF95F3E47ECDD0"/>
want of a more broken Heart.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is the Sin that most suiteth with the Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ence. The Conscience of the coming sinner tells <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m, that he hath nothing Good; that he stands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dictable for Ten thousand Talents; that he is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y ignorant, blind, and hard hearted Sinner, un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orthy to be once taken notice of by Jesus Christ. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd will you (says Unbelief) in such a case as now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou are, presume to come to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. It it the Sin that most suits with our Sense of feeling. The coming Sinner feels the Working of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n▪ of all manner of Sin and Wretchedness in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lesh; he also feels the Wrath and Judgment of God due to sin▪ and oftimes staggers under it. Now, says Unbelief▪ you may see you have no Grace for that which works in you is Corruption. You may also perceive that God doth not love you, because the sense of his wrath abides upon you. Therefore how can you bear the Face to come to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is sin above all others, that most suiteth the Wisdom of our Flesh. The Wisdom of our Flesh thinks it Prudence to question a while, to hearken to both sides a while, and not to be rash sudden, or unadvised, in too bold a presuming up∣on Jesus Christ. And this Wisdom Unbelief falls in with.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is the sin, above all others, that continually is whispering the Soul in the Ear with Mistrusts of the Faithfulness of God in keeping Promise to 'em that come to Jesus Christ for Life. It also suggests Mistrust about Christ's willingness to receive it. And no sin can do this so artificially as Unbelief.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is also that sin which is always at hand, to enter an Objection against this or that Promise, that by the spirit of God is brought to our Heart to comfort us. And if the poor coming Sinner is not aware of it, it will, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some Exaction, Slight▪ Trick or Cavil, quickly wrest from him the Promise a∣gain, and he shall have but little benefit of it.</P>
<P N="7">7. It is that, above all other sins, that weakens our Prayers, one Faith, our Love, our Diligence,
<PB N="174" REF="003002_0089_0FEF9B4AAAFB6B00"/>
our Hope and Expectations. It even taketh th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heart away from God in Duty.</P>
<P N="8">8. La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tly This sin, as I have said, even now i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> appears in the Soul with so many sweet Pretences t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> safety and security, that it is, as it were, Counse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sent from Heaven: bidding the Soul be wiser, wary<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> considerate▪ well advised, and to make heed of to rash a venture upon Believing. Be sure first tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God loves you: take hold of no Promise, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> you are forced by God unto it: neither be you sur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of your Salvation doubt it still, though the Testi∣mony of the Lord has often been confirmed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you? Live not by Faith but by Sense; and when you can neither see no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> feel, then fear and mistrust▪ then doubt and question all. This is the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vilish Counsel of Unbelief which is to covered over with specious Pretences▪ that the wisest Christian can hardly shake off these Reasonings.</P>
<P>But to be brief: Let me here give thee Christian Reader, a more particular Description of <HI>the</HI> Qualities of Unbelief, by opposing Faith unto it, in these Twenty five Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Faith believeth the Word of God, but Unbe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> questioneth the Certainty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the same, <HI>Ps.</HI> 106 4.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Faith believeth the Word, because it is true; the Unbelief doubteth thereof, because it is true, 1 Tim. 3.4.</P>
<P N="3">3 Faith sees more in a Promise of God to help, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all other things to hinder: but Unbelief not∣withstanding God's Promise, saith. How can these things be▪ Rom. 4.19 20, 21 2 King. 7.2.</P>
<P N="4">4. Faith will make thee see Love in the Heart of Christ▪ when with his Mouth he giveth Reproofs▪ but Unbelief will imagine Wrath in his Heart, when with his Mouth and Word he saith, he loves us, Mat. 15▪22 23.24 25 26, 27 23. Numb. 3.2.</P>
<P N="5">5 Faith will help the Soul to wait▪ though God desires to give? but Unbelief will take snuff and throw up all if God makes any carrying, Psal. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Isa. 8 16. 2 King 6 33 Psal. 100.13.14</P>

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Faith will suck Sweetness out of God's Rod; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Unbelief can find no comfort in his greatest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cies.

<P N="10">10 Faith bringeth us near to God, when we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from him; but Unbelief puts us far f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en we are near to him Heb. 10 22 ch, 3 12 13.</P>

He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> held the City and wept over it, saying, If thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dst known, even thou at least in this thy Day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e things that belong to thy Peace, but now they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hid from thine eyes, Luke 19 81.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Lastly, He is open and free hearted to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thee good, as is seen by the Joy and Rejoycing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he manifesteth at the coming home of poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>odigals.

Luk. 19</P>
<P>Sixthly, Coming Sinner, I will add another En∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouragement for thy help.</P>
<P>First, God hath prepared a Mercy Seat, a Throne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Grace to fit on▪ that thou may'st come thither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o him, and that he may from thence hear thee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd receive thee. I will commune with thee (saith <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e) from above thy Mercy Seat, Exod. 2.22.</P>
<P>As who would say, Sinner, when thou comest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me, thou shall find me upon the Mercy Seat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here also I am always to be found of the Un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one, coming Sinner. Thither I bring my Par∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on. Here I hear and receive their Petitions, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccept them to my Favour.</P>
<P>Secondly, God hath also prepared a Golden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltar for thee, to offer thy Prayers and Tears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon. A Golden Altar, it is called a Golden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltar▪ to shew what worth it is or in God's Account. For this Golden Altar is Jesus Christ. This Altar sanctifies thy Gift, and makes thy Sacrifice acceptable. This Altar then makes thy Groans, golden Groans; thy Tears golden tears, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd thy Prayers golden Prayers, in the Eyes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat God thou comest to, coming Sinner, Rev. 8.</P>
<P>Thirdly, God hath strewed all the way from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Grace of Hell, where thou wast, to the Gate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Heaven, whither thou art going with Flow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers out of his own Garden. Behold, how the Promises, Invitations, Calls, and Encourage∣ments,

like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thee, (take heed thou dost not tread them under foot Sin∣ner, with Promises did I say? Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, he hath mixt all these with his own Name, his Son's Name; also with the Name of Mercy, Good∣ness, Compassion, Love, Pity, Grace, Forgive∣ness, Pardon, and that not that may encou∣rage the coming S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nner.</P>
<P>Fourthly, He hath also for thy encouragment laid up the Names, &amp; set forth the Sons of those that have been saved: In his Book they are f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tly written, that thou thro' Patience &amp; Comfort of the Scripturs mightest H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe.</P>
<P N="1">1. In this Book is recorded Noah's Name and Sin, and ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God had Mercy on him.</P>
<P N="2">2. In this Record is Fairly written the Name of Lot, and the nature of his Sin: and how the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Mercy on him.</P>
<P N="3">3 I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Record thou hast also Fairly Written the Names of Moses, Aaron, Gideon, Sampson, David; Solomon, Peter and Paul, with the Na∣ture of their Sins, and how God had Mercy up∣on them, &amp; all to Encourage thee, coming Sinner</P>
<P N="4">4. I will add yet another Encouragement for the Man that is coming to Jesus Christ: Art thou a coming? Art thou coming indeed? Why?</P>
<P N="1">1. Then this thy coming is, by Vir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne of God's Call, thou art called: calling goes before com∣ing: Coming is not of Work, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im that Calleth. He went up into a Mountain &amp; called to him whom he would, and they c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to him <HI>Mark</HI> 3.13.</P>
<P N="2">2. Art thou coming, This is by Virtue of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣mination: God has made thee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and therefore thou art coming▪ Sol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng as them was<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dark∣ness, thou lovedst Darkness, and could not abide
<PB N="189" REF="003002_0096_0FEF9B62C694B910"/>
to come because thy deeds are evil: But now being Illuminated &amp; made to see what &amp; where thou art: &amp; also, what and where thy Saviour is, now thou art coming to Jesus Christ. Blessed art thou Simon Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jona: for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it (saith Christ) but my Father which is in Heaven. <HI>Mat.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 15, 16.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Art thou coming? This is because God hath inclined thy Heart to come, and hath desired thee, nay God hath called thee: Illumina∣ted thee: and inclined thine Heart to come, &amp; therefore thou comest to Jesus Christ: it is God than worketh in thee to will &amp; to come to Jesus Christ. Coming Sinner, bless God, for that he hath given thee a Will to come to Jesus Christ. It is a sign that thou belongest to Jesus Christ, because God has made thee willing to come to him, Ps. 102.2. Bless God for staying the Enemy of thy mind, had he not done it, thou wouldst as yet, have hated thine own Salvation.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Art thou coming to Jesus Christ? It is God that giveth thee Power; Power to pursue thy will in matters of thy salvation, is the Gift of God. 'Tis God that worketh in thee both to will &amp; to do, <HI>Phil</HI> 1 13. Not that God would wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l to them, where he gives no P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer; but that thou shouldest take notice the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer is an addition∣al mercy. The Church saw Will &amp; Power were two things when we cry'd, <HI>Draw me, we will run after thee.</HI> (Son<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1.4) &amp; so did <HI>David</HI> too, when he said, <HI>I will run the ways of by Commandments when thou shalt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nlarge my Heart:</HI> Will to come, &amp; Power to pursue <HI>thy Will</HI> is Double Mercy coming Sinner.</P>
<P>Fifthly, All thy strange, passionate, sudden Rushings forward after Jesus Christ (Coming Sinner know what I mean) they also are thy
<PB N="190" REF="003002_0097_0FEF9B65F00ED370"/>
helps from God: Perhaps thou feelest at some times more than at others, strong Stirrings up of Heart to fly to Jesus Christ? now thou hast i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this time a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>weet and st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le of the Spirit of God filling thy Sails with the fresh Gales of his good Spirit; and thou ridest at those times as upon the Wings of the Wind▪ being carried out beyond thy self, beyond the most of thy prayers, and also above all thy Fears and Temptations.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Coming Sinner, hast thou now and then had a Kiss of the sweet Lips of Jesus Christ? I mean, some blessed words dropping like a Honey-comb upon thy Soul to revive thee when thou art in the midst of thy Dumps.</P>
<P>Seventhly, Does not Jesus Christ sometimes give thee a glimpse of himself, though perhaps thou seest him not so long a time, as while you may tell Twenty.</P>
<P>Eighthly, Hast thou not sometimes, as it were the warmth of his Wings over shadowing the Face of thy Soul, that gives thee as it were, a load upon thy spirit as the bright Beams of the Sun do upon thy Body, when it suddenly breaks out of a Cloud, though presently all is gone away.</P>
<P>Well, all these things are the good Hand of thy God upon thee, &amp; they are upon thee to constrain to provoke, and to make the will∣ing and able to come (coming Sinner,) that thou mightest in the End be saved.</P>
