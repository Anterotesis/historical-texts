<HEAD>THE TESTIMONY OF THE Monthly Meeting of FRIENDS in PHILADELPHIA, CONCERNING OUR DEARLY BELOVED FRIEND, <HI>DANIEL STANTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN John the Divine was in exile in the isle of Patmos, "He heard a voice from Heaven, say∣ing, Write,—Blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea saith the spirit, that they may rest from their la∣bours, and their works do follow them;" —which we believe now is the portion of our worthy friend, concerning whose faithful services we are engaged from the united motives of love and duty, to give this testimony; desiring, that all who read it, and more especially the Youth, may be excited, by his example, to seek an
<PB N="iv" REF="012565_0003_0F8B15C226ACE8D0"/>
early acquaintance with the Lord, and to take up their daily cross in the prime of their days.—Thus, they also, may become shining lights and instruments of good to others.</P>
<P>HE was born in this city, in the year 1708, and his father dying before his birth, and his mother a few years after, he suffered great trials and hardships when very young:—Being early con∣cerned to seek the knowledge of God, he had a fervent desire to attend religious meetings, though subjected to many dif∣ficulties and discouragements, before that privilege was allowed him; yet, being earnest in his desires to obtain divine fa∣vour, he was eminently supported under great conflicts and probations, and, con∣tinuing faithful to the degrees of light and grace communicated, a dispensation of the gospel ministry was committed to him, sometime before the term of his ap∣prenticeship was expired; and abiding under the sanctifying power of truth, he grew in his gift, and became a zealous faithful minister.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="012565_0004_0F8B15C5A912E480"/>HE was very exemplary in his indus∣try and diligence, in labouring faithful∣ly at his trade, to provide for his own support, and after he married, and had children, for their maintenance; and was often concerned to advise others to the same necessary care; yet he continued fervent in spirit for the promotion of truth and righteousness, so that he was soon engaged to leave home, and the nearest connections of nature, to publish the glad tidings of the gospel,—and fre∣quently visited most of the meetings of Friends in this and the adjacent provinces, and several times as far as the eastern parts of New-England. Having thus ho∣nestly discharged his duty among us above twenty years, and feeling his mind constrained in the love of the gospel, to visit the few Friends who remained in some of the West-India islands, and from thence the meetings of Friends in general through Great-Britain and Ireland, he communicated his concern to a few of his most intimate friends, who having unity therewith, he was encouraged to lay it before our monthly meeting.—Before he entered on this weighty service, he passed
<PB N="vi" REF="012565_0005_0F8B15C652E762D0"/>
through a near trial and affliction in the death of his beloved wife; under which exercise he was graciously supported by the arm of divine strength, which had often been revealed for his help, in times of inward conflicts and outward distresses.</P>
<P>HIS concern to travel in the service of truth continuing, and the meeting having full unity with him therein, he embarked in the fifth month, 1748, accompanied by our dear friend, Samuel Nottingham, in a vessel bound for Barbadoes, and having visited the few meetings in that island, they went by way of Antigua to Tortola, where they continued some time, having some difficulty to get a passage to Eu∣rope; and their voyage thither was at∣tended with some singular hazards and dangers, which occasioned their landing in Ireland; where our friend Daniel con∣tinued some months, visiting the meet∣ings of Friends in that kingdom;—and after he apprehended himself clear, went over to England, and visited the meet∣ings generally in that nation, and in Wales and Scotland, where his meek circumspect conduct and conversation,
<PB N="vii" REF="012565_0006_0F8B15C6AFBE6980"/>
and lively edifying ministry, rendred his visit very acceptable and his memory precious.</P>
<P>IN his return home, and for some time after, he was in a low afflicted state of mind; being apprehensive, that through diffidence, and the want of perfect resig∣nation to the divine will, he had omitted fully performing the service required of him, by not visiting the few Friends in Holland: yet he was mercifully preserved, and after a time of deep exercise, raised again to sing of the mercies and loving kindness of God on the banks of deliver∣ance.</P>
<P>HE several times, with other Friends appointed to that service, visited the fami∣lies of Friends in this city, and between the years 1757 and 1760, being accompanied by our friend John Pemberton, he visited the families of Friends generally within, the limits of our meeting; which weighty exercising service, he was enabled to per∣form to our edification and satisfaction. After which, he was frequently engaged
<PB N="viii" REF="012565_0007_0F8B15C76B193BD0"/>
to excite Friends to this useful and edify∣ing practice.</P>
<P>IN the twelfth month, 1760, he set out on a visit to the meetings in the western parts of this province, and from thence in Maryland, Virginia, and North and South-Carolina, and returned in the sixth month following; since which he fre∣quently visited many of the meetings near home, and some as far as Long-island, and other parts of the province of New-York. Within the last two years, he visited the families of Friends of some of the meetings in West-Jersey, in the city of New-York, and part of Long-Island; and after his return from this service, with great peace and satisfaction, he ex∣pressed his apprehension that he was now clear of all places, and that his stay here was near over;—having an evidence, that he had been faithfully concerned from his youth to fear and serve God.</P>
<P>HIS chief labour and religious exer∣cises were in this city, where he was a di∣ligent attender of all our meetings, and
<PB N="ix" REF="012565_0008_0F8B15C82C592640"/>
often on committees appointed on the services of the church; in which he was solid and weighty in spirit, waiting for the springing up of life, being steadily concerned both in and out of meetings, to live near the divine fountain: Thus he was very frequently qualified, and en∣abled to stir up the pure mind, and to re∣count the gracious dealings of God to Mankind, and as a faithful embassador to warn the negligent to flee from the wrath to come, and to excite the people to bring forth fruits answerable to the great mercies graciously bestowed on us; and was sometimes constrained to declare in a prophetic manner, a day of trial, in divers instances, very shortly before such a sea∣son came to pass.</P>
<P>HE was of late deeply exercised in consideration of the evils of the horse races, stage plays, drunkenness, and o∣ther gross enormities encouraged and in∣creasing in this city; closely exhorting our youth against those pernicious and destructive devices of the enemy of man∣kind; and under the awful sense that God
<PB N="x" REF="012565_0009_0F8B15C93A29CD10"/>
will judge and punish the wicked and evil doers, he was often fervent in public sup∣plications, that the Lord would lengthen out the day of his merciful visitation, and yet try the people longer; which seasons were solemn and humblingly affecting; manifesting, that although he was very close and sharp in reproof against evil, yet most tenderly concerned, that the trans∣gressors of the righteous law of God might be prevailed with to repent, re∣turn, and live.</P>
<P>HIS love for the rising generation was very great; which he manifested by his af∣fectionate notice of them, and especially of those who were religiously inclined, and his house was open to receive such, his conversation with them being seasoned with grace, and his counsel instructive and helpful to those who had seeking desires after the knowledge of truth, often lov∣ingly inviting them to come, taste, and see, that the Lord is good; greatly de∣siring, that all who profess the truth, might walk agreeable to its dictates and be led thereby, as our worthy predeces∣sors
<PB N="xi" REF="012565_0010_0F8B15C9ECC3F218"/>
were, into that meekness, humility, and godly simplicity and plainness, which rendered them conspicuous and shining examples, and that none might rest short of the enjoyment of the life of religion, his zeal being great against such, who have the form of godliness, and by their actions manifest they have not the pow∣er thereof;—and he often fervently ad∣vis'd and cautioned those who are eager∣ly pursuing the world, and by the for∣feiting cares, and grasping after <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> treasures, frustrate the good purpose of the visitation of divine grace to them, and closely reminded those, who in their small beginnings were low and humble, that now they were abundantly favoured, they should not set their affections on things below, but remember the rock from whence they were hewn;—and his concern was great that those who had the glad tidings of the gospel to publish, might be true examples to the flock, and adorn the doctrine they had to deliver by a circumspect life and conversation, and where any by not steadily keeping to that which would have preserved them,
<PB N="xii" REF="012565_0011_0F8B15CD594C5568"/>
had involved themselves in difficulties, either by letting their minds out to the gains and profits of this world, or other∣wise, his travail was great for such that they might be brought through, and eve∣ry cloud and mist removed.</P>
<P>HE was much employed in visiting the sick and afflicted, to whom he admi∣nistred his spiritual advice and experience, and often engaged in humble prayer for their support; and in the distributing to the necessitous according to his circum∣stances, he manifested his benevolent dis∣position.</P>
<P>AS he had been many years under great exercise and suffering of spirit on account of the slavery of the poor Africans, and frequently bore testimony against that unrighteous gain of oppression, he was of late somewhat relieved, as he found the eyes of the people become more open to see the iniquity of the practice; and he died in faith, that the light of the gospel will so generally prevail, that the profes∣sors of christianity will find it their duty
<PB N="xiii" REF="012565_0012_0F8B15CD79130DB0"/>
to restore to these people their natural right to liberty, and to instruct them in the principles of the christian religion.</P>
<P>ON the fifth day of the fifth month, he was violently seized with the bilious cholic, and continued in great pain seve∣ral days; but afterwards being somewhat easier, he was at our morning and even∣ing Meetings on Firstday, the thirteenth of the month, in which he was much fa∣voured in his public ministry, and express∣ed that he thought his time would not be long with us. After this day's labour, he was again confined, yet being a little recovered he as at our meeting on Fifth∣day, the twenty-fourth of the month, which being small, he expressed his sor∣row for it, and encouraged Friends to diligence in the attendance of week day meetings, the benefit of a faithful dis∣charge of duty therein being great;— the next day he was at our monthly meeting, and to his own and our admi∣ration was enabled to stay through both our sittings, though the last of them was longer than usual, and he afterwards ex∣pressed
<PB N="xiv" REF="012565_0013_0F8B15CE2F43D698"/>
that he thought himself better in the meeting than when out;—it was a sea∣son of divine favour, and some weigh∣ty matters being before the meeting, he with great openness spoke pertinently and clearly to them, encouraging Friends to the supporting and maintaining our christian testimony, against all that is con∣trary to it: This was the last public meet∣ing he was at, being the next morning early seized with a renewed attack of the same disorder, which increased on him several days, and was so fixed, that all the endeavours of several skilful physici∣ans and tender nurses, were not effec∣tual to remove it, tho' in some measure to mitigate the pain, that he suffered much, not being able to lie down in his bed several weeks, yet thro' all he was mercifully supported, in much resignati∣on, and patience, rather inclining, if it was the Lord's will, to be released.</P>
<P>FOR two or three weeks before his sickness, he appeared very desirous of settling every thing he had to do respect∣ing the affairs of this life, and desired a
<PB N="xv" REF="012565_0014_0F8B15CEF0BB2C88"/>
Friend to review and transcribe the short memoirs he hath left of his travels and religious services, and to write his will, which he executed the day before he was first taken sick, and then appeared easy in his mind.</P>
<P>DURING the time of his sickness he often expressed his concern least his Friends should be too anxious for his re∣covery, saying, if he should live longer, and thro' any human frailty or infirmity occasion any reproach, it would be a cause of sorrow to them.</P>
<P>BY the desire of his Friends who attend∣ed him, he rode out several times, tho' not without much difficulty, and spent the two last days of his life at the houses of two of his intimate Friends. As he drew near his end, the strength of his love to mankind in general, and his Friends in particular, evidently increased, much desiring the prosperity of truth, and when a meeting time came had an ear∣nest desire to be with Friends, and parti∣cularly the day before his departure.</P>
<P><PB N="xvi" REF="012565_0015_0F8B15D0164CC168"/>DURING his sickness, he frequently expressed himself in a very seasonable, in∣structive, and affecting manner; and the evening of the Firstday before he dyed, several Friends coming in to see him, he spoke a considerable time to them, having before been desirous of such an opportuni∣ty of the company of his Friends, to sit down and wait upon God, which was his great delight.</P>
<P>THE last day of his life he spent at the house of his Friend Israel Pemberton, at Germantown, and was unusually free and chearful, even till ten o'clock at night, when he undressed himself, and went in∣to bed, remarking on lying down, that he had not before been able to do so, for five weeks or upwards, and he soon after fell asleep, but in a short time was awak∣ened by the return of pain and difficulty of breathing, which thro' his illness he had been much afflicted with, so that he was oblig'd to set up in bed, and thus continued, at intervals freely conversing with our said Friend, who sat up with him, and he expressed his great thankful∣ness
<PB N="xvii" REF="012565_0016_0F8B15D0853C9380"/>
that his head was preserved free from pain and his understanding clear, and that though it had been a time of close trial and deep probation, he could say he felt the evidence of divine support still to at∣tend him.—After which, his pains increas∣ing he got up and dressed himself, and walking about the room sometime, sat down in an easy chair, in which he fell into a sweet sleep, and in about three hours de∣parted without sigh or groan.</P>
<P>THUS died this righteous man, who having fought the good sight and kept the faith, finished his course in full unity with us, and universally beloved by his fellow citizens, on the twenty eighth day of the sixth month, 1770, in the 62d year of his age and 43d of his ministry. His body was the next day attended by a large num∣ber of people of divers religious denomi∣nations to our meeting house, and after∣wards interred in Friends burial ground in this city.</P>

<HEAD>DANIEL STANTON's ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE, TRAVELS AND LABOURS IN THE Service of the GOSPEL.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">

</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN a grateful sense of the many helps and great goodness of the Almigh∣ty to my soul, whereby he has been pleased from my young years to incline my heart to fear and serve him; it is on my mind to leave some account of my life, travels, and experience; wishing it may be a means to stir up the pure mind in any, to obey the will of the Lord, and to serve him, while they have time and
<PB N="2" REF="012565_0018_0F8B15D2BAB094F8"/>
opportunity to perform the same; for he is worthy to be had in everlasting remem∣brance, and is a good rewarder of all the sincere in heart; although they may have tribulations on the earth, they have also the company of Christ our dear redeemer, who promised to be with his disciples to the end of the world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The place and time of his birth.</NOTE>BY the account I have had, I was born in the year 1708, in Philadelphia, in the province of Pennsylvania, of honest pa∣rents, Daniel and Abigail Stanton, and it was my hard lot soon to be deprived of them both; my father I never saw, he be∣ing lost at Sea sometime before I was born; and my mother died when I was a child, so that I have but little remembrance of her.</P>
<P>AFTER her death, I met with great hardships, both of body and mind, being destitute of parents, and of brother or sis∣ter, that I was in a lonely state, and went to live at several places a short time, the last of which (before I was put apprentice) was in New-Jersey, with my mother's brother; during which time, I went
<PB N="3" REF="012565_0019_0F8B15D366A6C680"/>
through great difficulties, too tedious to mention.</P>
<P>I LIVED there several years, and had no opportunity to go to any place of reli∣gious worship; but the lord was pleased by his grace and good visitation, to ope∣rate on my mind, that I was made to dread and fear the great almighty Being, and it was given me to know, that
<Q>God is a spirit, and they who worship him, must worship him in spirit and truth;</Q>
and through the blessed knowledge of <HI>God</HI> by his holy spirit, I had great reproof in my own breast for sin and transgression, and dreaded to speak bad words, or to do what was evil, and was brought by inward conviction to mourn, and seek for mercy for my soul; and at a time when I heard of the suffering of my dear Saviour on the cross, and how he suffered unto death, my heart was broken before the Lord, and I went alone and wept, being much affect∣ed with a sense of his suffering by that hard hearted people, <HI>the Jews,</HI> and of his being crucified:—Great was the goodness of the Almighty to me, in giving me a
<PB N="4" REF="012565_0020_0F8B15D52B59C358"/>
sense of many things appertaining to God∣liness, in the time of this tender visitation; and I found by the divine witness in my∣self, that if I would be a disciple of Christ, I must take up my cross daily, to that which displeaseth God; he being greatly to be feared and obeyed, and was worthy of the deepest reverence that my soul, bo∣dy and strength could ascribe to his all powerful name.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH it was hard to the natu∣ral part to become slain to the recreations and pleasures of this life; fervent were my cries and seeking after the ways of the lord, and I thought much of eternity in another world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His first at∣dendance of meetings for religi∣ous wor∣ship.</NOTE>I HAD heard of many forms of worship, but had no opportunity to be with the people for that service to God, which was a great trouble to my mind; but at one time I asked leave to go and see a relation, with an intention for him to shew me the way to the meeting of Friends, which was held at New-town in Glocester county; he was loath to take the pains to accompany
<PB N="5" REF="012565_0021_0F8B15D5E228D3C8"/>
me, not knowing the solid desire of my mind; but through persuasion, I prevail∣ed with him to go with me to the meet∣ing, where I was more desirous to get some good, than to be seen of men. We sat in a part of the meeting together, where we were not much noticed by any that I know of, and in this blessed oppor∣tunity, through the power of truth, and the good testimony of that dear servant of Christ, <HI>John Estaugh,</HI> being attended with the authority of the word of life, my heart was greatly contrited and my spirit baptized in the presence of God, it was a joyful day of good tidings to my poor seeking soul, and the eminent and power∣ful advice, that did attend that worthy instrument in the Lord's hand for my sal∣vation, has been like
<Q>bread cast upon the waters that has been found after many days.</Q></P>
<P>I WENT from that meeting much satis∣fied with the way of worship of Friends, and continued earnest in spirit, that I might have further knowledge of the bles∣sed truth; my inward exercises were a
<PB N="6" REF="012565_0022_0F8B15D67B5B57D0"/>
great deal of sorrow and mourning, that I might come forward in the work of re∣ligion, and do that which was right in the sight of God.</P>
<P>LIVING with my uncle till near the age of sixteen years, I became uneasy, be∣ing desirous to learn a trade, not knowing what I might have to depend on for a live∣lihood, more than the labour of my hands; altho' my mother left considerable at her death, under the care of those who she expected would do justly by me; but it proved otherwise, they depriving me of the whole, to a small matter, less than twenty pounds: I went on trial to a ship carpenter in Philadelphia, in condescen∣tion to my uncle, it being a trade he ra∣ther chose for me, than I did for myself, and was there sometime, tho' I soon was dissatisfied both with the trade, and on account of the wicked conversation of the people of the yard, who being very vain, were a great exercise to my mind; tho' my master and mistress were kind and friendly to me, which was some comfort; but the greatest satisfaction I had in this
<PB N="7" REF="012565_0023_0F8B15D739C29348"/>
world, was that I could attend religious meetings on the first day of the week, and was often favoured to hear the truth de∣clared in the demonstration of the spirit and power, as also a secret divine power being at work in my heart, afforded solid pleasure and profit, in the midst of my trials; for, being soberly inclined, and de∣lighting to attend religious meetings, I met with scoffings and mockings, and some in an outrage would bid me go along to meeting, despising my diligence on that account; but I was enabled through mercy and grace, to bear revilings as well as many deep distresses, which fell to my lot; being much concerned to seek after the kingdom of God, and his righteous∣ness; oh the inward travel that I under∣went, none knew but the Lord! And at an evening meeting near where I sat, a lit∣tle way from the door, Benjamin Kidd, a Friend of the ministry, then on a visit to this province, from Old-England, came in and sat just by me, and in the meeting was eminently favoured in prayer, which I have many times thought was a particu∣lar instance of divine mercy to me, in so
<PB N="8" REF="012565_0024_0F8B15D7F9E75958"/>
deep a travel of soul and spirit, as I had to wade through in several respects at that time.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His appren∣ticeship.</NOTE>AFTER being some time at the ship carpenters trade, which not being agree∣able to me, I went again to my uncle's, where came a Friend from Philadelphia, who having seen me when I lived in town, would have me to go apprentice to him, he being a joiner; which I accordingly did, believing it would be of good service for me to have a trade to depend on; and served with him until I was about the age of twenty two years, and in the time of my apprenticeship, the goodness of the almighty was great in preserving me through my tribulations, which were va∣rious, beyond my setting forth; but the pure love and fear of the Lord, accompa∣nying my spirit, and through the divine appearance of light and grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel∣phia.</NOTE> I was led in a close walking before him; and my understanding was opened to have a sight of many things, which the spirit of truth leads into; some whereof were plainness in speech and cloathing, few words in
<PB N="9" REF="012565_0025_0F8B15D8A6E48330"/>
conversation, watchfulness and prayer, choosing rather to be alone, than in the company of those whose discourse and talking was out of the fear of God.</P>
<P>I MUCH delighted in retirement, and often walked alone and poured out my complaints before the allseeing eye, that knew the condition of my heart, desiring that he would be pleased
<Q>to create in me a clean heart, and to renew a right spi∣rit within me.</Q>
I wanted to know the work of reformation effectually carri∣ed on, according to the mind and will of the blessed truth, and the nearer I kept to what it made manifest, the greater strength and dominion was given me to overcome the defilements of the world; and a con∣cern came upon me in observing the pride and vain glory of the times:—I had very few acquaintance, and was rather despised and derided by some, who overlooked the Just Witness of Grace in themselves;
<Q>I chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin, for a season;</Q>
<Q>The sufferings of this present time worketh for
<PB N="10" REF="012565_0026_0F8B15D96BCA1540"/>
us,</Q>
as the apostle saith,
<Q>a more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</Q>
and the bles∣sed peace, that our dear Lord gives to those who follow him whilst here, is a re∣ward sufficient to the sincere in heart, to hold out to the end.</P>
<P>THE countenance and good example of faithful Friends had a great reach on my mind, and when I came to be more ac∣quainted with the dealings of the Lord, and could get frequently to religious meetings, and beheld the sitting of his servants, and attendance of his ministers, I could say, as did the queen of the South, who came from far to see the wisdom of Solomon, that the one half had not been told me, and one greater than Solomon was in the midst of his people; praised be his great name, even the name of Christ our dear Lord, that greatly appeared in power and majesty in Sion in those days, to the tendering my heart and spirit be∣fore him time after time, and not only eminently visited my soul, by his glori∣ous light and truth, but sent many of his servants among us, from far and near,
<PB N="11" REF="012565_0027_0F8B15DA26CDE238"/>
filled with gospel rain, to the watering the heritage of God; and the Lord, the master of our assemblies, was pleased to fasten their testimonies as nails in a sure place.</P>
<P>AFTER many powerful seasons of di∣vine grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His first ap∣pearance in the mini∣stry.</NOTE> being favoured to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living, as also
<Q>to taste and handle of the good word of life,</Q>
a great concern of soul came upon me to open my mouth in a public manner, for the cause of religion, and the prosperity of Sion, which was a great and weighty work for me to engage in, being one of the meanest in this world, as I thought, and an apprentice lad, reasons would arise in me against so great a duty, not knowing how I might be used by my master, and whether it might agree with the unity of Friends, they being a great and wise people in this city, and by their knowledge and experience, were gifted with a sight of spiritual things, be∣yond my low capacity, as well as zealous for the good cause of God in their day.— I waded for a considerable time through

much trouble and sorrow of spirit, lest I should go too fast, or before my divine Guide, for they who go before they are sent, cannot profit the people, or have peace in themselves, and peace to me and to do the will of the Lord, was what I most desired; oh! the earnest prayers that were in my heart that I might be rightly directed in all things, to the ho∣nour and praise of my blessed Lord and master; and a degree of his mighty power would lay such constraints upon me, that for Sion's sake I could not rest, and for Jerusalem's sake I could not hold my peace; so that after many powerful influences of the divine word, at about the age of twenty years I appeared in a few words, in prayer, at an evening meeting, in Phi∣ladelphia, and after this, sometimes in a few words by way of testimony, as they were put in my heart, in a great deal of fear and dread of the Almighty Being; and Friends bore with my appearance with much tenderness, and the ministry of those who were largely gifted in the mysteries of the kingdom, and like scribes well instructed thereto, that could bring

out of the treasury things new and old, would correspond with what I had to say in the fear of Lord; which blessed helps, together with the evidence of peace in my own breast, gave a confirmation to my mind, that I was in the way of my duty.</P>
<P>AFTER I came forth in this laborious exercise, I dreamed a dream, or saw in a vision, that I was as a little child born in∣to the world, and my mother was very tender of me (who I have thought to be the church) but there was an enemy that sought my life, and as though he would destroy me, but she that was my mother made her escape, and carried me into the wilderness, and we were preserved.—At another time when I was much concerned in spirit for acceptance with the Lord, I dreamed that I was travelling in a path, in which I met with some difficulties, and got through them and met with death, and a man came with a book, and it was said that my soul was acceptable with the Lord. I have had great cause to speak well of his excellent name for the reveal∣ing his secrets to my understanding, as I kept in his holy fear.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="012565_0030_0F8B15DEABD2B060"/>ABOUT the time that I first appeared in words in the congregations of the Lord's people, and sometime before, the glorious day spring from on high powerfully ap∣peared amongst us, and several were en∣gaged to speak to the praise of the Al∣mighty, and to bear testimony to his great and good name, three before I ap∣peared, and two afterwards; the first were Mary Nicholls, Benjamin Trotter, and Mary Emlen, the next were Joyce Marriot, and Elizabeth Widdifield, who continued serviceable ministers among Friends. I thought it might be said to be a time in some measure of the fulfilling the prophecy of the prophet Joel,
<Q>I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophecy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions; and also upon the servants, and upon the handmaids in those days, will I pour out my spirit.</Q>
Joel ii. 28, 29, 30. The plainness, zeal, and pious example of many Friends in those days, made them as lights in this city, and instructors to me to follow them, as they followed Christ; and as I kept inward before the Lord in

And some∣times I had drawings in my mind to go to a neighbouring meeting, and what I had to say in their hearing was well received.</P>
<P>AFTER I had served out my appren∣ticeship, I wrought journey-work,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expiration of his ap∣prentice∣ship.</NOTE> and lived with my master until his death, which was soon after I was free, and then wrought with another Friend in the city some time, when having an opportunity to go to Rhode-island, the place where my father was born, and several of his rela∣tions living there, I was desirous to see them, and while I was apprentice having an account of some estate that was my fa∣ther's, laying in that country;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1731.

1731, with Henry Frankland, from Old England, who came to America, on the service of truth, and being about going to those parts, was so kind as to take my company. He was a solid exemplary wor∣thy Friend, whose ministry and gospel la∣bour was to edification among Friends. My undertaking this journey was laid be∣fore our Monthly-Meeting, and Friends were pleased to give me a certificate.</P>
<P>THE first meeting we went to, was at Burlington, and from thence to several others in New-Jersey, as Little-Egg-har∣bour, Manesquan, Shrewsbury and Wood-bridge, and so to New-York, and to meet∣ings on the Main, and the Yearly Meet∣ing at Flushing, and to Friend's meetings pretty generally on Long-island; several of which were much to satisfaction and comfort; and I was glad to see and find the near unity that was among Friends, where our lot was cast.</P>
<P>FROM this island we went through Conecticut, which was a baptizing time to me, being a young traveller, not much
<PB N="17" REF="012565_0033_0F8B15E11F1C4778"/>
acquainted with the difference of places, and behaviour of people from home, their conversation, as also their principles, through that government being greatly different from Friends, and altho' high in profession of religion, seemed to me very little acquainted with the light and spirit of Christ. It was a dark time, in which I went through much deep inward suffer∣ing. We passed along until we got to Kingstown, near Rhode-island, where we had a meeting, and then had one on Connanicut, and attended the Yearly-Meeting at Newport, Rhode-island, which was very large, and I hope a good meet∣ing to a solid remnant. My Friend Henry Frankland, whom I accompanied so far, proceeded on his journey to visit Friends in New-England, and I staid in order to get my outward affairs settled, and to vi∣sit several Friends on that island, one of which was that dear and worthy Friend Jacob Mott, whose countenance shined and appeared as a follower and servant of Christ, it did me good to see him, and when I took my leave of him, his solid ad∣vice to me made lasting impressions on my
<PB N="18" REF="012565_0034_0F8B15E3322ABE30"/>
mind.—After I had staid some time at this place, and had seen my relations and Friends, I returned back to Philadelphia, where I had known in an extraordinary manner, the gracious dealings of the Al∣mighty; and I endeavoured to seek coun∣sel of him to know where I had best settle myself in the world, and it seemed most suitable for me to continue in this city, where I wrought journey-work at my trade sometime; after which I rented a shop, and sat up for myself, humbly desi∣ring of the Lord to add his blessing to my endeavours, not that I craved great things, but that by an honest industrious care I might have what was needful, as food and raiment, and desired
<Q>to do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with God.</Q>
And the abundant mercies and blessings wherewith he was graciously pleased to make way for me, both in things spiritu∣al and temporal, were and are gratefully to be remembred by me, his goodness and peace being as a stream of living water to my soul, when favoured to drink there∣at.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="012565_0035_0F8B15E3E67BBEE0"/>I WROUGHT hard at my outward call∣ing when at home, yet not so much con∣fined but that I kept close to religious meetings; in which the good presence of Christ our dear Lord, would many times overshadow them, and I have had to sit under the shadow thereof with great de∣light, and after such precious meetings with his people, I found my mind better qualified to attend to my necessary business and the affairs of life; and when the mo∣tions of truth would spring in my heart to visit religious meetings in places adja∣cent in Pennsylvania and New-Jersey, I freely gave up to go to them, and sincere∣ly laboured therein in the love of truth, in which I found great satisfaction, and with many Friends, the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, and I hope in places my labour was of some service; the praise of which I freely attribute to my great Lord and master Jesus Christ; blessed be his holy name! he sustained and support∣ed me, and through his gifs and grace preserved me in the fear of God; his fear was a fountain of life as well as unspeaka∣ble pleasure in my first setting out in the

know the kingdom of our heavenly Fa∣ther to be come, and his will to be done on earth as it is done in Heaven; and as we are taught to pray for this, it would be well for all mankind to come to the expe∣rience of it in themselves; for Christ our Lord said to some of old, <HI>"The kingdom of heaven is within you;"</HI> and the faithful have it in their experience to be the same now: It is a kingdom that consists of peace and joy to the faithful subjects of his holy reign and government.</P>
<P>IN the year 1732,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1732.</NOTE> I found freedom in my mind to accompany my uncle Thomas Chalkley to visit some of the meetings of Friends in Bucks county and New-Jer∣sey, and afterwards Chester county; in the performance of which we had near fellowship together, and Friends were kind, and I believe glad to see us; seve∣ral of those meetings were large, and I hope comfortable to many. He was a near fellowhelper to me in my religious labours for the promotion of truth, and a bright example in the meekness and patience of the lamb; I do not know that I was ever

<P>AND in the year 1735,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1735. His second visit to New-Eng∣land.</NOTE> having a con∣cern on my mind to visit Friends in New-England, and our Monthly-Meeting in this city, giving me a certificate of their concurrence therewith, I accordingly proceeded, and was at several meetings in the Jerseys, from thence I went to the Yearly-Meeting at Flushing, on Long-island, where was our Friend Joseph Gill from Ireland, and several from Pennsyl∣vania, the meetings were large, and reli∣gious labour was bestowed among the people. After it I visited Friends generally on that island, many of the meetings be∣ing very large and comfortable, attended I trust with the blessed power and presence of the Lord, which begat great nearness in the best fellowship with the tender-mind∣ed. I then proceeded to meetings on the Main, as West-Chester, Mamarineck, Rye, and several others; some of which

New-Eng∣land.</NOTE> from thence, after being at some meetings in Conecticut, I went forward to Rhode-island, which was a wearisome travel; but I got to New∣port, and met with a kind reception from Friends, whom I visited in much love, there being a great number who make a profession of the way of truth; I was glad to see them, and could have been more so that all lived in possession of the same. From Rhode-island I took meetings in my way to Nantucket, where on my arriving I was kindly taken home by Nathaniel Starbuck, whose heart and house were open to receive the messengers of Christ.— On this island I met with a great number of choice exemplary Friends, and had se∣veral meetings among them, which I be∣lieve tended to edification. Being clear of this place, I returned to the Main, and taking meetings in my way, came to Bos∣ton, where I spent some time with Friends, both in public meetings and in their fami∣lies; they being loving to me and glad of being visited, their number being small in the whole, but seemed to be well treated by people of other persuasions, far differ∣ent

from what it was in the early visits of Friends to that place, in which some of the servants of the most high, suffered un∣to death. From Boston I went to Lyn, Salem, and Newberry, and had comfor∣table meetings, as also at another place between Newberry and Dover, and after I had seen Friends at Dover and Cache∣chy, and a meeting near Dover, I return∣ed to Salem and Lyn, and staid some∣time at my kind Friend Zacheus Collins's, having met with some disappointment in travelling, which detained me some weeks, but I constantly attended meetings at Lyn, and found great openness and unity with Friends there, and believe my stay tend∣ed to some service, for the promoting of near love among the little flock of Christ in that place, having many blessed oppor∣tunities among them. I also went to the Yearly-Meeting at Boston, and back to the Yearly-Meeting at Lyn; which was large and greatly favoured with the mini∣stry and service of that worthy handmaid of the Lord, <HI>Lydia Norton.</HI> After this, and the Yearly-Meeting at Salem, I part∣ed with Friends in much love, and came

on my way homeward, visiting the meet∣ings generally as they came in course, also some back places, and at Swansey, Green∣wich, and some other meetings, and to Rhode-island; tho' some of these meetings were hard and suffering times, and tra∣velling wearisome, I was favoured with a share of peace in my own bosom.</P>
<P>AFTER a little stay at Newport, and some solid times among Friends, I took my leave and came to Kingstown meeting, and then set forward, passing through Co∣necticut with Jacob Barney, who came with me as a guide, and was a good com∣panion; we reached Mamarineck, and staid a meeting, at which were two mar∣riages; from thence to Long-island, where I made but a short stay, crossed at the Narrows and Staten-island, and got to Woodbridge meeting on the first day of the week, and the next day arrived at my own habitation, in about one week from Newport, and to my great satisfaction, found my family well, through the good providence of the Almighty.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="012565_0043_0F8B15EC0875E0D8"/>AFTER I came home I kept close to meetings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel∣phia.</NOTE> and faithfully laboured in that ability God giveth; being much concern∣ed for the prosperity of his glorious work amongst us; my outward endeavours were also blessed, as I kept to industry, and I always found it best to be diligent, and not slothful in business; yet fervent in spi∣rit serving the Lord; and by living in this city it was my lot often to visit the sick and those in affliction in this place, which were heart tendering and humbling times, which ought not to be forgotten by such who have been humbled under the mighty hand of God, and whom he has been pleased to relieve; but it is much to be lamented, that too many when raised from adversity, do forget in time of prosperity the dealings of the Almighty with them; the world and the uncertain things thereof, lead to forget what is cer∣tain to all men, that they must die, and af∣ter death that they are accountable to the Almighty Author of their being.</P>
<P>IN the year 1737,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1737.</NOTE> being appointed with several Friends of our Monthly-Meeting,
<PB N="28" REF="012565_0044_0F8B15EC27F34798"/>
to visit the families of Friends in this city, and having a concern on my mind for the service, I went to many places with my Uncle Chalkley, and other Friends, to good satisfaction. For some time I did not go any very distant journey, except once, as far as West-river, in Maryland, to the Yearly-Meeting, in company with my Friend Robert Jordan; but I diligently attended meetings in this city, and some∣times those near it, both in Pennsylvania and New-Jersey; which I did in much love, often choosing to go on foot, having in my young years had many heavenly seasons in that way of travelling.</P>

gave me ease of mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New-Eng∣land.</NOTE> and united my heart to the faithful among them. When clear there, we went on the Main, and tra∣velled to Newport, on Rhode-island, where we were lovingly received among Friends, and after a short stay, we pro∣ceeded to Dartmouth, and were at a meet∣ing there; and so forward through Bos∣ton, Lyn, and Salem, having meetings, in some of which I had satisfaction, and was glad to see Friends with whom I had some acquaintance in the best fellowship. The furthest place we went to in this journey was Salem; and were at several meetings on our return to Newport, which I hope tended to stir up the pure mind in some; altho' the life of religion appeared to be at a low ebb with many making a high profession thereof. After several good opportunities among Friends at Newport, we returned homewards through Conecticut, making a shore stay to rest at our Friend Thomas Franklin's, from whence we went to a meeting at New-town, on Long-island, then to New-York in company with several Friends, where we had a meeting, then proceeded home,

where I was glad to see my dear wife and family again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel∣phia.</NOTE> it being through the kind∣ness of divine Providence, and they were very near and dear to me. This journey was attended with hard travel and hard labour to my body, also in the exercise of the gift of the ministry; but it was in good will and much love to the people.</P>
<P>FROM the year 1745 to 1748, I kept much at home at our own meetings; yet went sometimes to other meetings in Pennsylvania and New-Jersey, as in the love of truth I was drawn forth to visit them; the Lord having a choice people in these provinces who fear his name, and my heart was often, filled with endeared love to the upright hearted seed of God, from my first acquaintance among them; being at times baptized and united together in the one spirit and fellowship, which is not in the wisdom of man, but from the power of God.</P>
<P>MY dear wife being weakly in body, and had been in a poor state of health for sometime, departed this life in the fortieth
<PB N="31" REF="012565_0047_0F8B15EF97EE28E0"/>
year of her age, on the first day of the second month, 1748, and I have good reason to believe that she is at rest, having before her death, expressed that she had made her peace with the Lord, and the evident tokens of his presence in her sickness, and at her latter end, much sup∣ported my mind in so great a trial, and loss of so good a wife and tender mother to my children, and one that loved the truth, and the servants of Christ, who lived an innocent life, being a pattern of plainness, a near companion, and true help-mate to me according to her capacity, both in things spiritual and temporal. Af∣ter her death, in about a week, I buried my youngest son, and four sons before the death of their dear mother; which were very near trials; but my greatest help in these as well as many other afflictions that have fallen to my lot, has been to submit to the blessed will of the Lord, who gives and takes away. Now having two daughters left, I was much concerned that the Almighty might be pleased to look in pity on them, as he did in mercy on me,

<P>AFTER I had settled my out∣ward concerns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1748.</NOTE> and had placed my dear children to be taken care of, until it pleased God that we should meet again, I left my habitation on the 13th day of the fifth month, 1748, af∣ter being on that day at a large meeting in our city, with Samuel Nottingham, a Friend from Northamptonshire, in Old-England, who was to be my companion. We came with a great number of our very loving Friends to Chester, had a solid meeting there that evening, lodged at our worthy Friend Grace Lloyd's, and next morning taking leave of our beloved Friends, we went on board the vessel and sat sail for Barbadoes. On the passage I met with near trials in spirit, and was at times almost overwhelmed by deep conflicts
<PB N="34" REF="012565_0050_0F8B15F16A7FBAF0"/>
of soul; but thro' the kindness and mercy of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbadoes.</NOTE> we arrived safe at Barbadoes, on the 21st day of the sixth month; where we met with several Friends who were kind and loving towards us, our dear Friend Joseph Gamble took us to his house, where we lodged for the most part of the time. After we had attended meetings at Bridgetown, the Lord being with us, en∣abled us by his mighty power to bear a faithful testimony, I trust, to his eternal Truth, we went to Speightstown, where we were favoured with some solid edifying meetings, tho' not so large as at Bridge∣town; we lodged at our esteemed Friend Edward Harrison's; we were also at the Spring meeting-house, where we lodged, a Friend living therein, and the next day had a meeting there, and in the afternoon at Bridgetown, which was large and end∣ed well. We were on this island twenty-one days, and having seen Friends gene∣rally, and been favoured with several edi∣fying seasons, we departed from thence with Captain Austin, to Antigua, in our way to Tortola; we staid one week and a day at Antigua, lodged at James Bir∣ket's
<PB N="35" REF="012565_0051_0F8B15F2715C1BC0"/>
who was very kind to us; but my mind was much burthened and dis∣tressed for that place and people, who are for the most part a wicked and sinful ge∣neration; we had no meeting among them, there being no Friend on the island, except Friend Birket, and no openness, that I could find to satisfaction, for the testimony of truth to be declared, only we had some solid conversation with some. I came away much bowed in spirit for the sins of the wicked in that island. From thence we went for Tortola, where we landed on the 28th of the seventh month, and met with several Friends in the even∣ing, that were glad to see us, at the house of our Friend John Pickering; where, and at our Friend William Thomas's, we lodged most of the time we were upon that island, they being truly kind and friendly to us; we were favoured with many good edifying meetings among Friends, there being two meeting-houses on the island, viz. one at a place called Fat-hog bay, the other at the Road; we attended both of them with diligence, near the space of six weeks, only that we
<PB N="36" REF="012565_0052_0F8B15F2E68CE198"/>
were once at an island called Joes-Van∣dikes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tortola.</NOTE> where we had a large good meet∣ing.</P>
<P>ON the ninth day of the ninth month, we left Tortola, in order to return to An∣tigua, with design to get a passage for England; but being in a vessel the cap∣tain of which knew not how to manage her, we were going a contrary course, in which if we had proceeded, we might all have been lost; we were much tossed and driven about, and through persuasions, we prevailed with the captain to turn back, and he brought us to Santa Croix; but our going into the harbour called <HI>Lime-trees</HI> to drop anchor, seemed as if it would have proved fatal to us, there ly∣ing a vessel armed with guns, from which we were fired at three times, and my com∣panion had like to have been shot; it seems they had a design to have sunk our vessel, having heard there was a Spanish privateer on the coast, and the Governor had given orders to keep her off; they suspected our's to be that vessel; but our mariners being in a great fright, made
<PB N="37" REF="012565_0053_0F8B15F667FB9C68"/>
signals that we had no ill design;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Santa Croix.</NOTE> when seeing we were in distress, they forbore firing, and through the kind deliverance of the Almighty we got safe in and dropt anchor. Praised and worshipped be the name of God, that was nigh at hand, and a present help in the time of need! may I forever adore his great and eminent name, with all the true in heart, throughout all generations! he will not suffer those to be confounded that trust in him, and who desire and endeavour faithfully to serve him. A particular case concerning pri∣vateering, sometime before I left home, now comes into my mind to mention. Some great men of our city being concern∣ed in fitting out vessels for that wicked business, which having brought a deep engagement on my mind, it came upon me as a weighty duty, to go to one of these men, faithfully to warn him against this unrighteous way of getting riches; I got a Friend to accompany me, and I cleared my spirit of a heavy burden; he pleaded for the practice, but used me civil∣ly.—A new vessel was fitted out sometime after, called the <HI>Tartar,</HI> which was much
<PB N="38" REF="012565_0054_0F8B15F71019B828"/>
talked of to do great matters in privateer∣ing; but, as I have been informed, she sunk before she got out to sea, and many or most of the people on board were drowned. I had peace of mind for hav∣ing discharged my duty, altho' I much lamented the unhappy circumstances of those poor fellow-mortals, losing their lives in such an evil undertaking.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the place where we came to an anchor—My companion went on shore at Santa Croix, and would have had me gone with him, but my mind be∣ing at that time much dejected, I chose to stay on board the vessel until next morn∣ing, when I went on shore, and met with my companion, who had agreed with a captain of a vessel, bound for Spanish-town, near Tortola, for our passage thi∣ther, we put our chests and other things on board this vessel, then went on shore, and travelled across the island on foot to Bas-end harbour, where the vessel was to go, choosing rather so to do, than to go round by water; in our walk we met with people that were kind to us; about noon

we called at a house and dined, and were entertained in a friendly manner; taking leave here, we went on towards Bas-end, stopping at another house some distance from the town for a drink of water, the people seeing we were strangers, and being acquainted with Friends, kindly invited us in, to stay with them until the ves∣sel came round to the harbour, and in∣formed us that there was no house in the town suitable for us to be at, which I found afterwards was true, for they seemed to be a very wicked people. We staid with these kind people two nights and part of two days, and on leaving them we would have satisfied them for the time we were there; but they would not take any thing for our entertainment, and seemed well pleased with our company; the man of the house attended us to the water side to see us embark on board the vessel we had been waiting for, where he parted with us in a friendly manner: I waited a while on the shore for the Captain to go on board, there being a vendue, and a great number of people gathered to it, among them the Governor of the place, (being an island

subject to the king of Denmark) and I have since thought, had we used endea∣vours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Santa Croix.</NOTE> we might have had a meeting a∣mong them, and I have wished it had hap∣pened so, for I have at times been desirous in a solemn manner for the welfare of that people; it in a fruitful island, and as good land I think as any I saw in all my travels, could it be inhabited by men of religious minds, so as to be fruitful to the heaven∣ly Father, who is willing to do good to mankind in general; but oh! the islands hereaway, how great and many are the sins of the people, mournful hath been my soul for their many abominations!</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tortola.</NOTE>WE sat sail, and arrived at Tortola on the 15th of the ninth month. The Cap∣tain and sailors were a wicked company, took some of our things from us, and de∣manded considerable more for our passage than we had agreed for, which we thought unreasonable; but they said we could af∣ford to pay, for that we were always go∣ing about; we told them we had the more need to be saving of what we had; they hoisted out the boat in an angry manner,
<PB N="41" REF="012565_0057_0F8B15F8E7AB9FD8"/>
and we paid them more than our passage to put us on shore; they first took use some distance from any house, and then landed us, which put us to the more difficulty what to do with our chests, and other ne∣cessaries, that they might be safe; but being seen by one Isaac Pickering (a kins∣man to our Friend John Pickering) he sent his lad to ask us to his house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tortola.</NOTE> where we went, and he was so kind as to send for our things, and took care of them, and lent us horses to go to his uncle's that night, where we were kindly received, and tenderly sympathized with on the disappointment and trouble, we had met with; they were dear and affectionate Friends to us on this island. We were at a meeting at Fat-hog bay, the 16th of the ninth month, and on the fourth day fol∣lowing, I was at one at the Road, both of them were good meetings. On the 23d of the month, I was taken ill of a fever at the house of our Friend Thomas Hum∣phreys, and the next day my kind Friend John Pickering brought a man and horse and took me to his house, where I remain∣ed very ill several weeks, and some of

the time I apprehended I should lay down my life among them; but it was the blessed will of the Lord to restore me again to some degree of strength, and I attended several meetings with Friends, wherein I had satisfaction, and on the 8th day of the eleventh month, I went to Gwan island, with our Friends James Parke and his wife, and staid till the eleventh of the same, and after having a comfortable time in his family, I returned to Tortola, it being the meeting day at Fat-hog bay, and it proved to be a meeting to satisfac∣tion.</P>
<P>AFTER a solid sitting and parting with several at our Friend John Pickering's, on the 21st of this month, we went on board a vessel bound to the island called St. Tho∣mas's (belonging to the Dutch) accompa∣nied by our said dear Friend,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thomas's island.</NOTE> and Thomas Humphreys, Jonas Lake, and Joseph Ryan, and on the 22d landed there, and understood that the Captain of the ship, bound for Amsterdam, in which we were to take our passage, in order to get to Eng∣land, was very ill. We lodged at John
<PB N="43" REF="012565_0059_0F8B15FA66F3D8F8"/>
Demane's one night, and the next day went on board the vessel, where we staid mostly till the last day of the month, and our dear Friends above-mentioned, after seeing us placed in the ship, parted with us in a tender, loving manner, and my heart was affected in parting with them: In the time we lay at anchor, the Captain died, and the chief mate, Robert Stewart, was appointed Captain in his stead, who was very kind to us in the ma∣ny distresses we met with on our passage.</P>
<P>SOME days before we sailed, my com∣panion was taken sick, which so increased, that on the passage he seemed near unto death, which was a great trial and exer∣cise to me, being myself weakly and fee∣ble, for we were companions in tribulati∣on; but thro' the mercy of the Almigh∣ty, he recovered.</P>
<P>AFTER we had been three weeks and some days at sea, a great storm arose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At sea.</NOTE> which appeared to be very dangerous, that in order to lighten the vessel, the seamen threw out several weighty things; after
<PB N="44" REF="012565_0060_0F8B15FC97286FB0"/>
some weeks we got into soundings in the English channel, and were in hopes to be soon safe landed at some port in England; but another storm arose, which drove us off to sea, yet in eight days we again got soundings, but the wind being against us, we could not get forward to our expecta∣tion, and it rather suiting us to go to Ire∣land, the Captain altered his course for Kinsale harbour, as the vessel wanted re∣pairs one of the Rudder-irons being broke, made it difficult to steer the vessel, but by endeavours, they managed pretty well, and the day we made sail for that land, we got in sight of the harbour, but night coming on, and being fearful of rocks and shoals, they put off to sea, and the weather being moderate the fore part of the night, the seamen were too careless and did not keep so strict a watch as they ought; but the Captain, as he lay in his cabbin had so great an uneasiness on his mind, that he could not lay still any long∣er, and went towards the head of the ves∣sel, and found that instead of being out at sea, we were near striking on the land, whereupon he immediately awaked the
<PB N="45" REF="012565_0061_0F8B15FEAB2D5C28"/>
sailors, and they tacked the vessel about, and were very watchful until the morn∣ing, thus we escaped that danger;<NOTE PLACE="marg">In a storm on the coast of Ire∣land.</NOTE> in the morning it was very foggy, and a storm a∣rose, and we could not discover the har∣bour, but were driven about for a consi∣derable time, they threw over board one anchor; but the storm continuing and the weather distressing, we were drove to∣wards the land, and the seamen being al∣most wearied out, apprehended we could not keep off much longer; thus we were in great distress, expecting the vessel would be wrecked, and the Captain being much surprised, came to my companion and me, telling us he would do what he could to save our lives, for that we were in great danger of being lost, and he ex∣pected we should be drove on the shore in the night, if we kept off in the day, and was desirous to know our minds, what he had best to do; whether to run the ship aground while we had day light, that if a∣ny of our lives were spared, we could the better see how to help ourselves; we not knowing what to advise him for the best, only to trust in the good providence

of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1749.</NOTE> the Captain concluded to steer towards the land; the cries and lamenta∣tions of the people were great for mercy to their souls, apprehending the vessel might be soon dashed to pieces, and we might suddenly lose our lives; but I had reason to believe that the Gracious and Merciful Being was pleased to hear our cries, for the nearer we came to the land the fog cleared away, and they espied a vessel, which as we approached nearer, we discovered was laying at anchor at the mouth of Kinsale harbour, where we wanted to be, and as we came on our way, the harbour appeared plain;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrives safe in Kinsale harbour.</NOTE> thus through the great deliverance of the Almighty, we arrived there safe, and dropt anchor; for this his merciful preservation, our hearts had great cause to be humbly bowed before him, and the Captain came to me, say∣ing,
<Q>Now if you have it in your heart to return God thanks, I will join with you on my bare knees,</Q>
and
<Q>if it had not been for your prayers, we should all have been lost;</Q>
but I ascribed this great deliver∣ance to the kind mercy of Divine Provi∣dence to us all; altho' I can truly say, my
<PB N="47" REF="012565_0063_0F8B15FFA980D8F0"/>
soul was earnest in supplication before the Lord at times on this trying passage, and at one particular season, as I lay in my cabbin, not knowing but that we might be swallowed up in the mighty ocean, the spirit of prayer came on me, and I was raised on my knees to make intercession with the All-powerful Being, after which I went upon the deck, and the Captain seeing me, expressed in a very loving manner his unity and satisfaction, and I thought that the same good power and presence which attended my mind, had some reach upon his heart.</P>
<P>OH! in this trying passage, how often did my soul go down into many discou∣ragements, but I was helped through all, to rely on God's mercy, and on a time I took the blessed Bible into my hands, and it was as if my eyes were call on that pas∣sage in the prophet Isaiah, xliv. 1, 2, 3. where it is said;
<Q>Now hear, O Jacob my servant, and Israel whom I have chosen: Thus saith the Lord that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob my servant, and

thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen; For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring.</Q>
This gracious blessing of the Lord to his servants and chosen ones, was a comfort to me, and in his great condescension he fulfilled his pro∣mise to help in the needful time.</P>

<P>Landing at <HI>Kinsale</HI> in <HI>Ireland:</HI>—His Travels and Labours in that Kingdom; also in <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the Time of return∣ing Home.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT was on the 24th day of the first month, 1749, in the evening,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1749. Ireland.</NOTE> that we came to an anchor, in this safe harbour of Kinsale—when the officers and people from the town, came on board to see what we had in our vessel, some of whom staid all night, and my companion and I were confined to the hearing of their noisy conversation, until the next morn∣ing, so that we got but little rest, and had very little for several nights and days before; the Captain being gone on shore, returned the next day, and a civil man with him, who mentioned the names of several Friends that had visited that town, some of whom had come from America, which was pleasing to me to hear of; they having left their home a little before me, and had been travelling in the service of

truth. When this friendly man returned on shore, we went with him to his house, being an inn; where we were civilly en∣tertained, he took care of our chests and cloathing, and provided us with horses, and a guid to conduct us to Cork, being about ten miles; when we got there, be∣ing strangers, we were at a loss to find our Friends; we alighted at a public-house, and went in and got some refreshment; my companion inquired of a man in the house after our Friends in the town, who answered, that there were a great many of the brethren lived there; he was desired to go to one of them, and inform him that we wanted to speak with him; in a short time he brought one of our Friends, nam∣ed Richard Allen, at the sight of whom I was well pleased, and he lovingly took us to his house, where soon after came A∣braham Fuller, and another Friend, who asked for our certificates, which they read and were satisfied; our Friend A∣braham Fuller inviting us to his house, we went with him, and made it our home, while I staid in Cork; we were favoured that evening with the company of several

Friends, which I esteemed a great mercy from the Lord, that after being delivered from so many imminent dangers, we could be with so kind a people as they were to us;<NOTE PLACE="marg">At Cork.</NOTE> the next day being the first of the week, I was at two meetings with Friends in that city, and my companion at one of them, which I hope will be re∣membered by both of us.</P>
<P>BEING brought unexpectedly and pro∣videntially to this land, I much desired that I might proceed aright in the course of my religious service, for when on our passage, I expected to land in England, and meeting with many trials of my faith, and deep sufferings in the West-India is∣lands, as also at sea, I was ready to fear whether my present undertaking was from a right motion, or required of me to en∣gage in, thinking that if I got safe to England, and saw some Friends there, and could meet with an opportunity to return home, whether I had not best so to do, not knowing that my lot would be cast in Ireland; but Divine Wisdom or∣dering every thing that is consistent with
<PB N="52" REF="012565_0068_0F8B160433A5F450"/>
his Will for the best, I was made willing to visit Friends of this nation, and from Cork, I went to Bandon with my compa∣nion, where we had a large comfortable meeting, being many people there be∣sides those of our religious society; then returned to Cork, where I staid several meetings; leaving my companion in this city, he being desirous to go home from thence, I proceeded on my journeys, first went to Youghall, and was favoured with a good meeting, after that to Kill∣common, and had a meeting; from thence to Cashall meeting, which was pretty large, and I hope to satisfaction; I lodged at Solomon Watson's, who accompanied me to Clonmel, where I was at two meetings, which I hope were of some service to stir up the pure mind in those who attended them; from this place travelling twenty miles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Waterford.</NOTE> in a great deal of rain, I reached Wa∣terford, where my kind Friends Isaac Jacobs and his wife, received me in a loving, ten∣der manner, which was a comfort to me at that time, for I had been travelling in the deeps both inwardly and outwardly, be∣ing alone as to an outward companion,
<PB N="53" REF="012565_0069_0F8B1604E6423C38"/>
(except the person who was my guide) looking upon myself as a pilgrim and stranger in a strangeland; but the Almigh∣ty helped me, praised be his worthy name; we had a good meeting at Waterford, from thence I went to Ross,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ross.</NOTE> at which meet∣ing the wicked were warned of their wick∣edness; the next day I had a meeting at Lambstown, in which I was favoured with my good master's presence, and it was to edification and comfort; from this place I went to Wexford,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wexford.</NOTE> where the meeting ended to satisfaction; from thence to Jo∣seph Williams's and lodged, and to the meeting at Cooladine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cooladine.</NOTE> and in the evening had a meeting at the widow Stephens's both of them being comfortable seasons: I then went to John Wright's, and Henry Herrit's, and to Billicane, having meet∣ings to good satisfaction; after which in company with several Friends, I went to Dublin, and attended the Half-Year's meeting, which was large,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dublin.</NOTE> being there ma∣ny choice Friends, whom I was glad to see, and the good presence and kindness, of our dear Lord being witnessed and en∣joyed, both in the meetings for worship,
<PB N="54" REF="012565_0070_0F8B1606915AA850"/>
and the discipline, made it a comfortable time to me, not having seen such a meet∣ing since I left my native land, and the kindness and friendship that appeared a∣mong Friends at this meeting I have of∣ten remembred with comfort of mind, and the near unity I felt in my heart to a remnant among them, tended to the re∣newing of my strength and willingness to visit Friends generally in that nation; and my journey being laid out by Friends, that I might proceed for the best, in respect to travelling, I went from my kind land∣lord's, Peter Judd, several miles to a meeting, and to Killconnor, and was at a meeting there, which altho' they were hard suffering times, I hope were of some service to the solid minded; I had here a tendering time in the family of Samuel Watson, his dear wife having visited A∣merica, I had seen her in my native land; she was a worthy and serviceable instru∣ment in the Lord's hand to many I believe where her lot was cast; from hence I went to Carlow, where the meeting was to me laborious; then to John Lakes, Balitore, Athlone, and Mountmelick, some of which
<PB N="55" REF="012565_0071_0F8B160739C3E720"/>
meetings were comfortable satisfactory seasons; at Mountmelick, I lodged at Joshua Strangman's, with whom I had great nearness in spirit, and thought him to be a hopeful young man in the way of truth, and my soul possessed sweet peace under his roof; from hence I went to Ballinakill, Monntrath, Munderhead, and Rosegay, and had meetings, some of them being large and edifying seasons, gave relief to the deep travel of my soul among them, the blessed power of Truth, which is the crown of our religious meet∣ings, tenderly affecting our hearts before the Lord; I then went to Limerick, and was at their meeting in the morning and afternoon, to satisfaction; from thence to Jonathan Barnes, and was at a meeting at Killcommon-moor, the fore part of which was to me a time of great leanness and poverty of spirit, but before it ended, was I believe a time of tender visitation to the people; and I was enabled through Divine Help, to declare the word of life among them; from thence I went to Burr, and was at a solid broken meeting, which was a comfortable season; then to Wil∣liam
<PB N="56" REF="012565_0072_0F8B1607E8065A68"/>
Litsall's, and Ballymorin, and had meetings; so returned to Athlone, called the center of Ireland, and lodged at Wil∣liam Sproul's, an antient loving Friend, who not only appeared to be, but I believe really was an example in the way of truth in that place, and had a lasting remem∣brance in my mind; from thence I went to the Moat, and Old Castle, at the last place there came to the meeting a priest, and a pretty many people, who behaved soberly, and I hope it was a good meet∣ing; the next meeting was Ballahays, which was small, and the comers to it seemed to be but indifferent professors of the truth, which was cause of sorrow to my heart; but having cleared myself, I proceeded to Coothill, and had a meeting to which several came, and behaved sober∣ly; the next was Cashelshane, which was to satisfaction and comfort; from thence to Charlemont, which was a large meeting, and I had hard labour to discharge my duty among them; here came a man and woman, who had been troublesome to Friends, in offering their intentions of mar∣riage, who could not have unity with

their proceedings, he not being a member of our religious society, and a disorderly person, but at the conclusion of the meeting, they took each other as man and wife, which imposition occasioned the meeting to break up in disorder; from hence I went to Ballyhagan, which was a a large and edifying meeting, and so to Colerain, Ballynacre, the Grange, and Antrim, and had meetings, which were mostly hard suffering times, and the com∣ers to those meetings, I was afraid were several of them but lifeless professors of re∣ligion: I had the next meeting at Hils∣borough, at which were many Friends, and it tended to satisfaction; that same day I had a good meeting at Lisburn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Belfast.</NOTE> from thence I passed through Belfast to New∣town, where came some who behaved rudely, and the meeting was not so well as could be desired; the next was Ballene∣derry, which was very large, and the Lord's good presence being with us, the hearts of the faithful for his many mercies had cause to give thanksgivings and praises to his most worthy name; after this meeting I had a near parting time at
<PB N="58" REF="012565_0074_0F8B1609666CC2F0"/>
John Murrows, with many dear Friends, who came to take their leave of me; from thence I went to Monallin and Lurgan, and had meetings, and to that at the last place came many persons of great note, and behaved extraordinary sober, and we were favoured with a good meeting; the next was at Rafer-island, to which also came some not of our society, who confessed to the truth of what I had to de∣clare among them, and parted with me in love.—I went several miles that afternoon, and lodged at Dundalk at an inn; the next day and part of the night I travelled forty miles, some of the way in a great deal of pain, and in a wet tired condition, to Edenderry where I was received at John Pim's, in a loving, kind manner; I at∣tended their meetings on the first day in the forenoon and afternoon, which were large and I hope in the main, good meetings, the next were at Rathangen, and Tima∣hoe, which were comfortable; from thence I went to Dublin,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dublin.</NOTE> and lodged at my dear Friend Peter Judd's, and was in and a∣bout Dublin nine days, and at several good living meetings among Friends in that ci∣ty;
<PB N="59" REF="012565_0075_0F8B160B420D9E98"/>
and there being a remnant of dear Friends in some part of that nation, I had comfort of mind, in going to see and visit them in the love of God; and it being his blessed will to cast my lot in that part of the world, I faithfully laboured to dis∣charge my duty in his fear, both to Friends and other people, that had freedom to come to our religious meetings, and several ap∣peared to be reached by the power of truth, who did not make profession among us.</P>
<P>ON the 29th of the fourth month:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Embarks for Eng∣land.</NOTE> I embarked for England, accompanied by several Friends on board the vessel, where we parted in tender love, and on the first day of the fifth month, I landed at Whiteha∣ven, altogether a stranger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrives at Whiteha∣ven.</NOTE> and no out∣ward companion, which to me was lonely in a strange land; but the Almighty was in his mercy and goodness near to me, to be my comforter, and I had great cause to bow with a bended heart in deep thank∣fulness before him, for his wonderful providence and many helps and deliver∣ances: I enquired the way to Daniel. Ste∣phenson's, by whom I was lovingly re∣ceived,
<PB N="60" REF="012565_0076_0F8B160D55B6F5C0"/>
and kindly entertained; the next day being the first day of the week,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At White∣haven.</NOTE> I was at two meetings with Friends at White∣haven, which I have often remembered. My way being laid out to visit Friends in Cumberland, I went forward the 3d of the fifth month, on my way to Cocker∣mouth, and in travelling on the road my mind was much thoughtful, not know∣ing that I should meet with any one to be a comfort to me, when not far from the town to which I was going, I met with two Friends, at first sight I did not know either of them, but one of them speaking to me, I found it to be Christopher Wilson, at which my heart was much rejoiced, he being a Friend who had travelled among us, in the work of the ministry in America, and I had seen in Philadelphia; the meet∣ing to which I intended, not being to be held till the next day, I turned back with him to his house; where we had near con∣versation together in the love of truth; the next day he accompanied me to the meeting appointed, which was a solid time; the day following I went to Jzel, and had a meeting with the few Friends
<PB N="61" REF="012565_0077_0F8B160DE99F4DD0"/>
there, and altho' small it was a solid meet∣ing; after that, I was at Pardsaw-hall, which was a good meeting, so to Brough∣ton, and had comfort of mind among Friends thereaway. I then returned to Pardsaw-hall again, and on the first day of the week the meeting was very large, and the good presence of God attending the same, made it an humbling comfortable season; the same day I was at a large meet∣ing, near Christopher Wilson's, which ended well; from thence was at Keswick, tho' small a good meeting, so to Mosdale and had a large satisfactory meeting, also at Colbeck, Bolton, and Wigton, some of which were large, and I hope tended to edification and comfort; from thence I went to Allanby, and Holm, and had large meetings, in which the power of truth prevailed in a good degree, the next was at Kirkbride, in which I had hard service, and a close testimony to the un∣concerned in the way of truth, which I left to their consideration; from thence I went to Jonathan Astell's, who and his wife were choice antient Friends, my stay at their house, and being with such
<PB N="62" REF="012565_0078_0F8B160ED7B41D80"/>
dear Friends, afforded me at that time re∣newed comfort of mind; for altho' the Lord was gracious in some places power∣fully to assist my poor spirit to discharge my duty, yet at times I met with close sufferings and bemoanings, for the arising of the Divine Spring of life, both in my∣self and others; I went to Carlisle from thence, and so back to Moor-house meet∣ing, then to Scotby, Kirklington, and a meeting that John Irwen and his wife be∣longed to, who were both antient Friends, and I believe had been of service in the work of the ministry; and altho' some of those meetings were trying times, and attended with hard labour, I trust that I was clear in the sight of God in endea∣vouring to be faithful to what I appre∣hended to be my duty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Northum∣berland.</NOTE>FROM Cumberland, I went into Nor∣thumberland, and the first meeting I was at, was Cuthbert Wigham's, where was a considerable number of newly convin∣ced Friends, which was a comfortable and contrited meeting before the Lord; from thence I went to West-Allandale, to a large
<PB N="63" REF="012565_0079_0F8B160F6682B808"/>
meeting, which was powerfully reached with the sense of the love of God; the next meeting was at Alston-moor, which tho' not very large, I hope might tend to the benefit of some; then Penrith, Terril, and Strickland meetings, some of which were to satisfaction, and I met with a kind reception, and had near unity with many dear Friends in divers places.</P>
<P>FROM Strickland, I went to Kendal, in Westmoreland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">West∣moreland.</NOTE> to my dear Friend John Crowdson's, where I staid some days and rested as to travelling; but attended pretty many meetings in Kendal, to which belonged many worthy Friends, who were extraordinary kind and friendly, which I esteemed a favour, yet at that time, I was in a very low situation of mind, much overwhelmed with many inward sorrows, and conflicts of soul; but was intent to do the best I could to get through what might fall to my lot at so great a distance from my outward habitation, trusting in the Almighty hand of the Lord, who alone know my distressed condition, and to whom I put forth my cries and secret ad∣dresses
<PB N="64" REF="012565_0080_0F8B16139D3CB5F0"/>
for relief; <HI>dominion and everlasting praise be rendered to him for evermore!</HI> in the course of what he was pleased to lay upon my mind to say in meetings by way of testimony, he was also pleated to be gracious in appearing to open my way in the cause I had at heart, which was the promotion of welldoing, and the good of mankind here and hereafter; at this place meetings were large, and I hope blessed with the notice of heaven; to this meeting belonged Margaret Coupland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kendal.</NOTE> who had visited our parts, was an exem∣plary solid Friend, and retained the lively sense of truth; while I was here, I receiv∣ed a letter from my kind Friend Israel Pemberton the younger, giving me some account of my dear children and Friends at home, which was very acceptable to me; this dear Friend's worthy father be∣ing a bright pattern and elder in the church of Christ, given to hospitality and good works, the near unity I had with him in spirit gave me much comfort and satisfac∣tion of mind, as he was brought frequent∣ly to my remembrance in this journey. On account of my children, I had been

<P>FROM Kendal I went to Grayrig, which was a solid tender broken meeting, also to Preston Patrick, Windermere, and Hawk∣side, which meetings were to satisfaction, and ended well; from thence to Hight meeting, in Lancashire, which afforded some comfort to my mind, the next was at Swarth-moor-hall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lancashire.</NOTE> where George Fox belonged in his time, which was a large and a good meeting, from thence I went to Lancaster, and was at two meetings on the first day of the week, which were large and comfortable, here lived Lydia Lancaster, and Elizabeth Rawlinson, both worthy Friends who had visited America, and in one of those meetings, they both appeared in a living testimony for the

Lord in their advanced age, and it did me good to perceive that they were alive in the root of life; at this meeting was William Thomas, a ministring Friend from Tortola, lately landed; I went that day home with William Backhouse, a Friend who had visited America in the work of the ministry, he received me ve∣ry kindly and lovingly in his house; the next day I was at Yellan meeting, which was to satisfaction; then to Bentham, which was a large meeting, and attended with the solid power of truth, from thence to Dent, in which meeting the spring of life was opened among us, to the comfort of the sincere in heart, to this meeting belonged John Burton, who had visited our parts, a dear Friend I was glad to see, having seen him in my native land; the next meetings were Brigflats, and Raven∣stondale, which I hope tended to edifica∣tion; to the last belonged Alice Alderson, a worthy instrument, who had travelled in America on the Lord's errand, and was truly acceptable in her religious visit; from thence I went to Grisedale, and was at a large living meeting, the next was at
<PB N="67" REF="012565_0083_0F8B161568E42B90"/>
Counterset, which was large and solid; from thence I went to Swale-dale, Aus∣garth, Richmond, and another meeting in my way to Raby, some of which meetings were satisfactory solid seasons; at Raby, I met with several worthy Friends, who I found in conversation to be true help∣mates to me, particularly James Wilson and Joseph Taylor; I had seen Joseph in Philadelphia, when on his religious visit to our country, and it was a pleasure and comfort now to see him in his own habita∣tion; from this place, I went to Bishop-Auckland, Durham, Benfieldside,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Durham county.</NOTE> and New-Castle upon Tyne, which meetings were mostly hard laborious times to my baptiz∣ed spirit; then to Shields, Sunderland, Shotton, and Darlington, the opportuni∣ties with Friends thereaway, being most∣ly comfortable; after these meetings I went to Stockton, Gisborough, Yalton, and Castletown, where I had meetings, some of which were to satisfaction; after this I went to that dear antient Friend, John Richardson's, he had been twice to America on religious visits, and had taken much pains in his day and time, for the

spreading and promoting the gospel of peace and salvation in the earth, and al∣tho' he was antient and feeble in body, he was fresh and green in the life of religion, and my heart was refreshed, in the unity and fellowship of Divine life, in being in his company; I lodged here, and the next day went to the meeting at Kirby-moor-side, to which he belonged, which was a solid good meeting, from hence to Ampwelford, Rilsdale, Thirsk and Kirby, some of which were weighty solid meet∣ings, and the humble in heart were con∣trited therein; then to the (Quarterly-Meeting at York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yorkshire.</NOTE> which held several days for worship and the discipline of the church, was very large and attended by many solid Friends from their particular meetings, near unity and gospel fellow∣ship being in a good degree manifested, this opportunity begat an agreeable acquaintance with many Friends whom I afterwards found to be very friendly and kind to me, as I went forward on my jour∣ney. From this city I went to Thornton, Molton, Pickering, Withy, Stanton, Scarborough, and was at meetings, several

of them being large, and edifying;—I was next at Bridlington, to which meet∣ing came a pretty many people, but it was a time of hard labour, this meeting being declined from what it had been for∣merly, according to the account I had of it, and the few Friends left, did not live in that unity I could have been glad to have found among them; to this meeting once belonged Margaret Langdale, who came to Philadelphia, and was afterwards the wife of our worthy Friend Samuel Preston, late of that city, her labours a∣mong Friends in the work of the ministry were of great service in her time.</P>
<P>FROM Bridlington I came to Hornsey, and to two other places, and so to Hull, having meetings, some of which were large, being attended both by Friends and other people, and the Divine Presence of the Almighty being over all, they ended to good satisfaction. From Hull I went to a meeting in my way to Cave-holden, Pontifract, Rawcliff, and Thorn, to which meetings I travelled in great affliction of body, and much conflict of spirit, on

account of great besetments that fell to my lot in the course of my travels, and the work and warfare that I honestly laboured in, having left all that was near and dear to me as a creature, on account of the blessed truth; that had not the All-power∣ful Aid helped me, to look to him in whom everlasting strength is, I had faint∣ed; but dominion and praise to him for∣ever, his strength was made perfect in my great weakness! and in those meetings I was enabled to bear a testimony to his Al∣mighty name, altho' out of meetings greatly beset; yet keeping my confidence in God, he was pleased in his great mercy to cast up a way for my help and deliver∣ance!</P>
<P>FROM Thorn, I went to my dear Friend Joseph Atkinson's at Rawcliff, who and his wife were as tender towards me as if I had been one of their own fami∣ly; after some stay with these my loving Friends, I got better in health, and the motion of life and love increasing in my heart to visit the churches, I proceeded, and went to Thorn meeting, which was
<PB N="71" REF="012565_0087_0F8B1619FB8CB0A0"/>
an edifying good time; here I met with my Friend John Fisher, who accompanied me to several places, having before tra∣velled mostly alone, both in England and Ireland, as to a constant companion;— we had two meetings in our way to Wil∣liam Payne's, where we had a meeting, and at Hansworth-Woodhouse, to which last belonged John Haslam, a dear Friend who had been very acceptable in his reli∣gious visit to Friends in America, and had visited the churches to the great com∣fort of the faithful; his agreeable compa∣ny at his own house, renewed our fresh unity in pure and lasting fellowship in the gospel of peace; from thence we went to Sheffield, where we had two large good meetings; the next was Burton, which was large and a comfortable time; the next meeting was at Wakefield, where came a pretty many people, in which I was silent, as it so fell out at several places in meetings appointed, which I have con∣cluded, if rightly minded, might be a means to bring people to hearken to the alone teacher in their own hearts, for it is there the word of faith is to be obeyed;

and altho' the dependance of the outward ear sometimes may be upon the servants of Christ; yet they cannot speak aright, and to the witness in the consciences of men, but as he is pleased by his spirit to give them utterance; the design and ten∣dency of all true gospel ministry, which springs from the Divine Word of life, be∣ing to stir up the pure mind to adhere to the holy teaching of Christ in their own souls.</P>
<P>THE next meeting was at Gildersham, which was a solid good opportunity, and dearly united my spirit to some who at∣tended the same; from hence I went to Leeds, and was at two large meetings on the first day, and at a week day meeting, some of which, I hope tended to pro∣mote true spiritual worship to God; from hence we went to Waldale, Brighouse, and Rawden, and had meetings which were large solid and comfortable; the next was at Bradford, to which came a pretty many people, and it ended well; we lodged at Benjamin Bartlett's, where we met with Edmund Peckover, Jane Hos∣kins,
<PB N="73" REF="012565_0089_0F8B161C784BF8D8"/>
and May Drumond; my worthy Friend Edmund, having left great sweet∣ness in the minds of many in America, and on mine in particular, it was a com∣fort to me to see him again.</P>
<P>FROM hence we went to Halifax, ac∣companied by William Longmier, a dear brother and fellow helper in the gospel, who had been with us to several meetings before, and was choice company, and did me much good; the meeting at Halifax was large, and ended I hope to the ho∣nour of Truth: here I parted with my companion, John Fisher, and went to five distant places, having meetings in my way to Skipton, some of which were large, being attended both by Friends and other people, and I believe to edifi∣cation: I had a good time at the meeting at Skipton, and with the schollars of my Friend David Hall at his school, having near unity with his company, I lodged here one night, and went from thence to Lowtherdale, where William and Mary Slater belonged, who were serviceable Friends in the work of the ministry; this
<PB N="74" REF="012565_0090_0F8B161D2EEAE8F8"/>
meeting was large and eminently affected with the sense of Divine Life and Power; the next meetings were Ayrton, Settle, and Newton, which were mostly solid and satisfactory; the next was Narsedale, which was small, and I was fearful very cold professors of the right way of worship in this I was silent; from thence I went to the Fiel, Proud-Preston, Longridge, and Elmaridge, and had meetings, which tho' mostly small were pretty satisfactory; the meetings following were Sowledale, Trow∣den, Marsden, and Trodmarden, and at another place, which were generally large and edifying. I went next to the meet∣ings at Holdham, Manchester, Langtree, Aston, Bickerstaff, and Liverpool, some of which were pretty large and solidly comfortable;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lancashire.</NOTE> from Liverpool I went to Pankith, Warrington, and Framby, which meetings were large and uniting seasons to the honest hearted; at the last place I was much relieved and set at liber∣ty thro' the dominion of the Divine Pow∣er that attended; from this place came Esther Clare to Pennsylvania, a Friend of the ministry, a member of our meeting in

Philadelphia, who was divinely endowed and inspired with a knowledge in the things of God's kingdom, and was a helpful instrument in the hand of the Lord to me in my young years:—The next meetings were Sutton, Newton, and John Downs in Cheshire, to solid com∣fort; from thence I went to Chester, and to Rixham in Wales, which were hard small meetings, and dull as to the life of religion; then returning into Cheshire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cheshire.</NOTE> to Namptwich, and Middlewitch, had meetings which were comfortable seasons: I then went to the house of a Friend be∣longing to Morley, where I rested some days as to travelling; during my stay here I visited the sick, and some Friends fami∣lies, and Morley meeting which was large, and the good presence of the Lord attending, made it a good meeting; from thence I went to Stockport, Maxfield, and Leek, some of which meetings were large and to satisfaction; the last place was in Staffordshire, in my way from Joshua Tofft's to Stafford I had a meeting;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stafford∣shire.</NOTE> as likewise in that town, which was small, and the life of truth appearing at a low
<PB N="76" REF="012565_0092_0F8B161E66DC2A78"/>
ebb among them, was cause of sorrow and suffering to my mind; the next meeting was at Birmingham, which was pretty large, and I hope of service to some who were there;—from thence I went to Coventry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Warwick∣shire.</NOTE> and lodged at my kinsman's John Newman, his wife being my wife's first cousin, they were exemplary Friends truly kind and loving, and a comfort to me in meeting with them at their own house; here I heard of the death of my dear aunt Martha Chalkley, from a Friend living at this place, the account of which much affected my spirit for the loss of so near a relation and dear Friend, whom I much loved and esteemed, she being one who feared the Lord, and was serviceable to Friends where she lived in her time.</P>
<P>AT Coventry I was at two large meet∣ings, one of which was much crowded by reason of a funeral, and both were solid opportunities with the people; from hence I went tp Badgley, and another place some distance, and was at two solid meet∣ings; the next were at Warwick, and Eatington, from whence I went to Ship∣ton,
<PB N="77" REF="012565_0093_0F8B161F7A127480"/>
in Worcestershire, and was at two large meetings to edification, from thence to Longcompton, Radway,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Worcester∣shire.</NOTE> and Harbo∣rough, some of which meetings were large and solid; at the last place I was told, that the people when they heard of the meet∣ing intended, said they would come to see the Outlandish man, and many came who behaved soberly, and Divine Life pre∣vailed that day among us to the comfort of my mind; from thence I went forward to two meetings in my way to Worcester, at distant places; at Worcester the meet∣ings were large and solid, and tho' some professors appeared to be gone out from the way of the self denying life, into much liberty and extravagance, yet I be∣lieve it was a time of visitation to their souls; from this city I went to Bewdley, Bromsgrove, Sturbridge, Dudley, and Colebrookdale, at which places I had meetings, mostly pretty large, solid, and edifying; the next place I went to was Shrewsbury, where,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shropshire.</NOTE> in company with seve∣ral Friends, I visited two dear Friends that were in prison on account of tithes, and our hearts being tendered together, we had to

praise the Lord and were comforted altho' in such a place of outward confinement; I was also at a meeting in the meeting-house which tho' not large was I hope well.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wales.</NOTE>FROM hence I went into Wales, with John Fowler, a solid young man, who tho' not a public minister, came out of Warwickshire on purpose to accompany me; our first meeting was at Dolobran in Montgomeryshire, which was small and poor; then we came to Ellis Lewis's where we had a meeting with a few plain kind Friends, and at Twinde, in Merrioneth∣shire, where were only three Friends to keep up the meeting; but it afforded much comfort to my mind, that I had an opportunity to see them, with whom we had a solid time; the next meeting was at John Goodwin's in the same County, a brave worthy man, who had been instru∣mental to bring several to the knowledge of the truth thereaway, and where is a large meeting, in which it gave me satis∣faction in being among them; from thence we went to Talcot, and so into Radnor∣shire in South Wales, where we had two
<PB N="79" REF="012565_0095_0F8B1622265DEA28"/>
large good meetings, then to Pennybank in Carmarthenshire, and at Thomas Price's we had a small solid meeting, and at Ann Evan's in Cardiganshire, to which came many people, and the meeting was to sa∣tisfaction and comfort; we then had a meeting in our way to Carmarthen, and there also, which were small and but few faithful labourers, and the unsteadiness of some made it a mournful time to me; from thence I came to Haverford-west, where the Friends of Redstone met, which meeting was somewhat satisfactory. In my way from my dear Friend John Lewis's to Swanzey, I had two distant meetings, one of which was large and mostly people who did not profess with us, and I hope was of good service, the life and power of the Divine Word bring∣ing the minds of the people into stillness, the meeting ended well.—I was at two meetings at Swanzey, the first small and silent, the other a large open time; from thence we came to John Bevan's, where we had a small hard meeting, then at Pontypool, where the meeting was pret∣ty large and I hope ended well; we had
<PB N="80" REF="012565_0096_0F8B1624173D43B8"/>
also an evening meeting at a Friends house, which was a comfortable time; and one at Shirenewton, not very large, but a good meeting, this being the last in Wales; having visited all the meet∣ings in that country that could be called by our name, as near as I remember, ex∣cept Pedstown, and some of that meeting were at Haverford-west; when I had got there, I had great cause to be humbly thankful to my kind Lord and Master, for his Divine Help and merciful preservation thro' much toilsome travel both of body and spirit.</P>
<P>FROM thence I went to Ross in Here∣fordshire, and on my way parted with my companion John Fowler, his desire being to return home after this journey; at Ross I had a comfortable meeting, and went forward to Hamler, Leominster, and Bromyard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hereford∣shire.</NOTE> having meetings; the two first were solid good opportunities, and at Leominster, it was large and some hope∣ful newly convinced Friends were there; the other was almost lifeless as to a true zeal for Divine Worship, and but little

prospect of the growth of truth; from thence I came into Glocestershire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Glocester∣shire.</NOTE> and had meetings at Teuksbury, Cheltenham, Glo∣cester, Painswick, and Nailsworth, some of which were hard suffering times, and I sin∣cerely wish the life of righteousness more abounded among the professors thereof; from thence I came to Thornbury and to Ann Young's, and was at two good meet∣ings, then to Bristol,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bristol.</NOTE> where I attended several large meetings, in which the kind hand of the Lord was with us, and I found Friends there to be very loving, and left them in the same; I also visit∣ed Kingsweston and Frenchay, which were large solid and edifying meetings; from thence to Sadsbury, Tedbury, Cirences∣ter, Addington, and Camden, having meetings, and I trust was clear as to my duty among them; the next meetings were Milton, Burford, Whitney,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oxford∣shire.</NOTE> Chal∣bury, Chippingnorton, Hooknorton, and Sedford, several of which were large good opportunities; from thence I went for∣ward to Southnewton, and Banbury, and was at three meetings, one of which was silent, the other large good opportunities;
<PB N="82" REF="012565_0098_0F8B1554C2288938"/>
at Banbury I was favoured with the com∣pany of my Friend Benjamin Kidd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1750.</NOTE> who I had formerly seen in Philadelphia, when a lad, and was a comfort to me when I was in a reverent search after the things of God's kingdom; the friendship of this dear Friend at his house, was also now an encouragement to me in the way of my religious Service.</P>
<P>FROM hence I went forward into seve∣ral counties, and was at a number of meet∣ings in different places, which I hope were of profit to the people, and in some places they were large; at two of them I had the company of my beloved Friends Catharine Payton and Rachel Wilson, they being in their way to the Yearly-Meeting at London;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Berkshire.</NOTE> we went forward together to Reading, where I met with my dear wor∣thy Friend Samuel Hopwood, with whom when in Pennsylvania, I had travelled to some places, and I believe was now glad of our meeting to see each other again; he was a zealous and fervent labourer in the Lord's vineyard, who I believe had blessed his labours to many souls; we had a meet∣ing
<PB N="83" REF="012565_0099_0F8B1555718FA710"/>
at Reading to sweet satisfaction; from thence we all went to Maidenhead, and was at a meeting there, in which I was si∣lent; from this town we went to London together,<NOTE PLACE="marg">London.</NOTE> and on our way several Friends met us; our Friend John Hunt being one of them, would have me to his house, and gave me a kind reception, where I made my home for the most part during the times my lot was cast in that great city.</P>
<P>THE Yearly-Meeting was large, and I hope edifying to many honest travellers in Sion's way.</P>
<P>WHEN this meeting was over, I went for Scotland, finding my mind drawn forth in much love to Friends in those parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotland.</NOTE> as I had after I first landed in England; but thro' some discouragement in myself, omitted the opportunity of going there when I was in Cumberland, near the bor∣ders of it, which caused me much more travelling to get to see Friends thereaway; but in regard to peace of mind, which is to be valued above all the world, I now gave up to perform this visit.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="012565_0100_0F8B15562ACDC768"/>FROM London I went through several counties, having many meetings in parti∣cular places appointed, I was also at three Yearly-Meetings in my journey, as Col∣chester, Woodbridge, and Norwich, se∣veral of which were large and satisfactory, as were also some of the appointed meet∣ings, tho' small, and I had near commu∣nion in spirit with some Friends as I pas∣sed thro' Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, and Lincolnshire, and in Yorkshire; I pro∣ceeded from York to Darlington with my companion John Kendal, a solid young man of Colchester, who had a savoury testimony for truth; we had a good meet∣ing at Darlington, then went forward to Durham, and Newcastle, at each of which towns we had meetings, and Friends were kind in assisting to get us on our way to Alnwick, where we had a small meet∣ing, and lodged at John Doubliday's; we then proceeded to Kelso, where we had two good solid meetings; then to Edin∣burgh, and had a meeting to some satisfac∣tion; after which we had but one little meeting, which was in a Friend's house,

until we got to Aberdeen, where we had two that wore large,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scotland.</NOTE> in which I hope the Lord's Power was in dominion to solid comfort; from thence we went to Kins∣wells, Inverary, and Old Meldrom, and had meetings to some degree of satisfacti∣on; the last named place was the furthest meeting we had in Scotland, which was pretty large: from thence we came to Kilmuck, and was favoured with a com∣fortable meeting and somewhat large; the next was at New Aberdeen, also at Urie, at the seat of Robert Barclay, which were solid opportunities; at Urie there came many people, Friends and others, who behaved with solid attention, which made it a time of profit I hope to some; at this place we met with our Friends David Bar∣clay, his wife and two daughters from Lon∣don, who had come on a visit to their re∣lations and Friends in those parts, and when they sat out from home we came a pretty many miles on our way with them; they were very kind and friendly, and by this acquaintance such a love was begat in the hearts of those kind Friends, that when I came back to London they had me

and got there that night, where we were lovingly received,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lancashires</NOTE> stayed some time for rest, and attended several large, solid, good meetings, and visited divers dear friends in the town; from hence pro∣ceeded to meetings at the following places, viz. Crook, Preston, Lancaster and Man∣chester, which were mostly to satisfaction; then went into Derbyshire, to Moniash,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Derbyshire.</NOTE> Matlock, Brick and Chesterfield, and se∣veral other places, some of which meetings were large, and I hope of service through Divine Help, for the promotion of truth; I parted with my dear Friend John Ken∣dal, soon after I left Manchester, he intend∣ing to return home, after our long journey thro' Scotland; from this county I passed through Northamptonshire, Lincolnshire, Leicestershire, having many meetings, se∣veral of which I hope were to the satisfac∣tion of the faithful; at a particular meet∣ing not far from Leicester, to which came a considerable number of Friends, some of them from several distant meetings, it be∣ing the first day of the week, as we sat to∣gether in silence before the Lord, there was a shock of an earthquake, which made a

great stir in the place, and the people who were met at another house for worship, came away, as I was told, to our meeting, where we were preserved in great stillness and little appearance of slavish fear, and I hope it was a singular time of benefit to that assembly.—From this county I went into Rutlandshire, Buckinghamshire, Bed∣fordshire, and Hartfordshire, and was at a number of meetings, some of which were fa∣voured with a sense of the Lord's blessed power and presence; the next counties were Huntingdonshire and Cambridgeshire, in which were several solid meetings, tho' that at Cambridge was small, and the darkness of that dark place much depres∣sed my spirit, which was attended with deep suffering;—I went from this county into the Isle-of-Ely, and visited the meet∣ings generally thereaway; in the per∣formance of which I had some comfort of mind; from hence I went into Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Hartford counties, vi∣siting meetings as they were laid out by Friends, there being in several places some valuable solid Brethren, with whom I had near unity of spirit, in that faith which

stands not in the wisdom of man, but in the power of God; from hence I came in∣to Middlesex, and had meetings, also at Basingtoke, Alton and Salisbury and se∣veral other places in Wiltshire, some of which were comfortable seasons in the best sense; I then went into Somerset∣shire, and to Bath and Froome, and some other places, and had meetings; then to Posset, and was favoured with a satisfac∣tory meeting there, and the next day I was taken ill at my friend James Player's, it being I thought pretty much the effect of a cold, hard travelling and a close en∣gagement of body and spirit I had pas∣sed through from one place to another; this illness detained me some weeks, in which time I was brought very weak in body, and at times low in spirit; but through the kind mercy of God, having somewhat recovered (tho' still weak) I sat out for the West of England, and went to Clareham, Glastonbury, Bridgewater, and many other places, at which I had meet∣ings, some being large and mercifully fa∣voured with Divine Help, uniting love and power; after visiting the meetings in

the county of Somerset; I went into De∣vonshire and Cornwal, having the compa∣ny of my dearly beloved friend John Play∣er, to whose spirit I was nearly united in the love of truth, and was a great comfort and help to me in my weak condition, at his uncle's.—I would just remark that in some of the counties in which I had been, some dear young people, who were libertine in the shew of pride and finery of the world, became sober, solid and ex∣emplary, and one young woman in parti∣cular was so reached, as I sat in a Friend's house, tho' I had nothing by way of testi∣mony in words to her condition, yet the weight and exercise attending my mind at that time, so reached her understanding, she became a plain solid Friend, and be∣fore I left England, I heared her in the mi∣nistry at a meeting, and as I thought, to the general satisfaction of Friends present;— I was at Exeter meeting in Devonshire, and had a weighty solid time among Friends there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Devonshire.</NOTE> although I was much af∣flicted with the conversation of one pro∣fessing the truth, that pleaded for carnal defence, and asked what defence we had

<P>AFTER having a pleasing time much to my comfort, with my loving kind Friend Samuel Bownas, who had visited America in the work of the ministry twice, I proceeded to several meetings in my way to Weymouth and Pool, where I also had meetings, some of which were solid times; then taking several meetings in my way to Southampton, I had there a small meeting; then passed over to Cowes on the Isle-of-Wight, and after visiting Friends there,

and being favoured with some solid meet∣ings among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1751.

<P>AFTER I had thus visited London, I went to a considerable number of meetings in places some distance from thence, some of which were large weighty solid oppor∣tunities; my beloved Friend John Pem∣berton, whose company was acceptable, being with me at several of them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">London.</NOTE>HAVING gone through all the coun∣ties in England, and generally visited Friends meetings therein, as also those in Wales and Scotland, I attended the Year∣ly-Meeting in London, which was large and much favoured with the loving kind∣ness and blessed presence of the Almighty; many dear Friends being here with whom I had near acquaintance, it was a comfort to my spirit that I could see them and part with them in the unity and love of truth; a short time after the conclusion of this meeting, accompanied by several loving Friends, I went to Gravesend, in order to embark on board a vessel bound for New-York, which not being ready for sailing

when we came there, our dear Friends left us, I believe in true love, my spirit nearly and affectionately parting with them; Edward Cathrall of Philadelphia, was passenger with me in this vessel, Che∣valier Dean being commander; we sat sail and came away as soon as we could from Gravesend, and after a passage of about eleven weeks, landed at New-York on the 10th day of the seventh month, 1751 old style, and on the 13th of the same month we got home to our habitations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel∣phia.</NOTE> being the day before our Yearly-Meeting in this city. Which was through the great preservation of the Almighty, who was, and is a God nigh at hand, who sup∣ported and preserved me in great probati∣ons and conflicts of soul, beyond my abi∣lity to set forth in words; but I think it my duty to say, <HI>Good is the Lord and great∣ly worthy to be feared, praised, loved, ho∣noured, worshipped, and obeyed!</HI> his good∣ness, mercy and grace have been eminent for my preservation and salvation, that he would not suffer me to be confounded, altho' he was pleased to permit great prov∣ings to befall me, both in my passage home

and after I got to my habitation, accord∣ing to his All-wise purposes; yet under∣neath has been his everlasting Arm of com∣passion and strength, which has wrought for my deliverance, and enabled me to commit my soul, body, and spirit to his keeping.—My dear children and affectio∣nate Friends, I believe were glad for my return to them, and altho' I much desired to get to my native land and to see them again, after an absence of more than three years; yet my expectation as to the plea∣sure and comfort of that Divine Blessing in a manner I could have wished, was much disappointed, which I have thought was in part occasioned through an omissi∣on of duty, tho' I hope it was not wilful; it being to go on a visit to a people of ano∣the language, and I omitted the oppor∣tunity of performing that part of service, and had I gone on that errand, I might have got home as soon as I now did, and my once expected satisfaction I might have enjoyed.—A vessel belonging to our city, the Captain a member of our society, whom I knew and esteemed, was desi∣rous of my taking passage with him from

London, from whence he did not sail un∣til several weeks after us, and arrived at Philadelphia, about the time I landed at New-York, that had I proceeded on the visit which was upon my mind, it was thought I might have performed it, and have been ready to embark in this vessel; but a cowardice and dissidence of my own abilities at times, and a fear of going too fast (I think I can honestly say) more than wilful disobedience, have brought some of the greatest sorrows upon me that I have met with in the world; but the mercies of God are great, who ought to be served and adored, and is worthy of the deep∣est reverence that can be ascribed to his All-Powerful Name!</P>
<P>AFTER a time of great anxiety he was pleased by his gracious Arm to deliver me, and to put a new song into my mouth, even praises to him the Living God! the light of his glorious Countenance afresh shining upon me, his blessed <HI>"Sun of Righteousness"</HI> appeared with healing un∣der his wings, and I was sat at liberty again in a good degree to serve and praise him the Lord in the land of the living.</P>

Thomas Lightfoot concluded to go forward to accompany the women Friends in their visit to the other parts of New-England, and my Friend Israel Pem∣berton and myself returned to Newport, where we were at several meetings, one was at the burial of the wife of Samuel Holmes, and in the main were solid meet∣ings; from thence we proceeded home∣wards through Conecticut,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conecticut.

<P>THERE were three Indian men accom∣panied us as far as Fort-Allen, Moses Tatamy, and two others; we travelled much in the night and through a great rain, stormy and cold weather, to reach that place to which we came the next morning, and the captain received us ve∣ry civilly, and I thought did what he could to be of service to us, and behaved very kindly and friendly to the Indians, which they seemed to take well; at first

but through the mercy and kindness of the Lord we were preserved; for which my soul had cause to be thankful to his great and good name.—At the other two treaties, I underwent with several faith∣ful hearts, a deal of inward suffering and anxiety of spirit; a dark and dismal cloud of opposition appearing to the good work of peace; but the minds of Friends being kept so as to look unto the Lord Al∣mighty, we had many extraordinary good meetings in waiting and thinking on him, and his dear beloved Son Christ Jesus, and at times in those meetings, the darkness would pass away, and the true light would shine to the renewing the hope of the humble; and the Lord, magnified be his name! prospered the endeavours of those faithful labourers, who had at heart this desirable work of peace, and I believe they will be heirs of that blessing, wherein Christ termeth the peace makers "Blessed," and calleth them the "children of God."</P>

<P>AFTER this journey I was at several meetings in this province and New-Jer∣sey, some of which were large and I hope beneficial to the well-minded, one of them was at the burial of William Paxson, at Neshamany in Bucks county, which was an awful solemn time, and a great ga∣thering of people; after these opportuni∣ties I staid much in the city, sincerely la∣bouring for the prosperity of Truth in our own meeting, with the faithful belonging to the same, until I found a draft on my mind to visit some meetings in the Jerseys, and the particular families of

Having performed this labour of love, I visited several meet∣ings in this province and New-Jersey, and attended the burials of some valuable

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Philadel∣phia.</NOTE>AFTER my return home, deep and weighty labour fell to my lot in our meet∣ings, as at many other times among Friends in this city; I also visited several who were weak in body, and some who were in deep affliction; and in the eleventh month this year, I attended Frankfort, Fair-hill, and Providence meetings, ap∣pointed by our worthy Friend Rachel Wilson, which were very large, and owned with a gospel visitation to the peo∣ple; after the last meeting our said dear Friend went to Chester, and the same day embarked on board a ship bound for Lon∣don, in order to return home with the wellwishes and prayers, I believe of a num∣ber, for her preservation and safe arrival; her faithful labours and diligent travels having given great satisfaction to many Friends and other people in America;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chester county Pennsylva∣nia.</NOTE> from Chester in company with Joshua Cres∣son, I came that night to George Miller's, and the next day went to Goshen Month∣ly-Meeting, which was a time of good

satisfaction to my mind, and I believe to others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chester county.</NOTE> from hence we went on our way towards Concord Quarterly-Meeting, which we attended, and it was large and relieving to my mind, finding nearness of spirit among Friends; also visited Birming∣ham meeting on the first day, and the ge∣neral (or youth's) meeting at Chester, and had several solid opportunities in places in the families of Friends, that both those meetings and the family visits, were I be∣lieve to edification and comfort; Friends being kind and loving, I returned home with a degree of peace in my own mind.</P>
<P>IN the same month I went with my Friend Israel Pemberton to the first day meeting at Bybury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bucks county.</NOTE> at which was Joseph White, who in his public testimony was led to be remarkably particular, as to the state of the meeting that day, which I believe was wished by many that it might have its desired proper service; the next day I came with my Friend Israel to the Month∣ly-Meeting at Abington, through a great deal of rain, the meeting was small but something satisfactory; on the seventh

day of the week following, I went into the Jerseys,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New-Jersey.</NOTE> stopped that evening at A∣quila Jones's, and had a sitting in the fa∣mily, where was a number of slaves, in which opportunity I found liberty to ad∣vise and caution all present in much love and good will, and I believe it was kindly received; the next day I was at the meet∣ing at Newtown in Glocester county, at which were many people, and to some good degree of satisfaction; having for a number of years had a desire at times for the growth of Truth in that place, I was made to rejoice of late, that Friends had agreed for sometime past to hold a meet∣ing there once a month, the house being good, and many people living no great distance, and altho' the meeting had been dropt for several years, I trust as it is again revived, that if it be continued, the Lord through his tender and merciful visitati∣on, may be pleased to place his name among them.</P>

of the blessed truth, as I have understood, some of whom remained serviceable among Friends, which I just mention as the Lord's blessing upon his own work, who is worthy of all the praise, glory, and ho∣nour for ever!—I know I have endea∣voured to serve him in fear and trembling, and frequently have been bowed under a sense of my great unworthiness; but great hath been his mercy and power, extended towards me a poor tribulated sufferer in spirit, for the blessed seed's sake; magnifi∣ed be his eminent name! he hath hitherto been my rock, fortress, and deliverer, and through his great kindness, I have a fixed hope in my mind of his salvation, through Christ Jesus my dear redeemer, whose glorious name let it be signified and adored for evermore!</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR FRIENDS;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN a measure of the same love that at∣tended my mind when present in bo∣dy among you, I take this freedom now to salute you in spirit, wishing the health and prosperity of the precious truth in every particular branch thereof; we as a people profess it to lead us into all truth, which is the greatest profession in the world, and is the most sure and safe for all the truly living and acting members of the mystical body and church of Christ,
<PB N="176" REF="012565_0191_0F8B15B9308D90C0"/>
to be guided by the wisdom and nature of it in all things, to the glory of God.</P>
<P>AND dear Friends, keep in the peace∣able wisdom and love of God, for
<Q>God is love, and Christ hath commanded us to love one another,</Q>
as also one of his servant's adviseth to love as brethren; let nothing break the unity that is in the true faith and peaceable spirit of Christ our holy head; but dear brethren; be of one mind in his righteous cause, in a particu∣lar manner in maintaining decency and good order in his church, that his church may be built and supported by living stones, and his vineyard kept clean and thriving with living branches, such that may bring forth much good fruit to the praise of God!—My spirit according to my measure is often with such among you, that have the weight of the Lord's work on your shoulders, and I have many times been comforted in remembring the refreshing and edifying seasons of the pow∣er and presence of Christ that we have en∣joyed together, in that ability he was pleased to afford unto us, when it was my
<PB N="177" REF="012565_0192_0F8B15B9EF4E4678"/>
lot to be in your parts; and I thought myself to be in a good degree clear as to my religious duty, only with respect to the meeting for business, it gave me some pain of mind, that there was no distincti∣on made betwen such that were of our own family (Friends in unity) and those of other persuasions, by allowing them the same privilege with Friends, in sit∣ing in those meetings, to see and observe the remarks on your own proper business, and they having no proper right as mem∣bers in the society, it must needs weaken the testimony, and the right labour of faithful Friends, and expose the manage∣ment of such meetings to the vain and libertine conversation of the world, and so cause the way of Truth to be evily spoken of, as also give great pain and ex∣ercise to the sincere-hearted.</P>
<P>IT is in much love and tenderness, that I have thus expressed myself in this re∣spect, and to ease the weight that has been on my mind, from a thought of that un∣usual custom, not allowed among Friends in other places where the authority of
<PB N="178" REF="012565_0193_0F8B15BAA75F0A60"/>
Truth takes place; I wish it may be re∣formed among you so as to have it other∣wise, which I believe will be more to the advantage of the church among yourselves, and greater satisfaction to the Lord's ser∣vants that may come to visit you in gos∣pel love; it had been better for me, I have thought, had I embraced the opportunity to have eased my spirit when we were to∣gether, but a backwardness prevented which I had rather had not happened; but if this is received in the same love that it is intended, I hope it may answer the same good design.</P>
<P>I DO not in the least desire by what I have mentioned, that any disrespect be shewn to those of other religious denomi∣nations, or to prevent their coming to our meetings for worship, or any christian office of love in any suitable way and man∣ner, so that it be consistent with our holy profession, but with respect to what I have hinted, I have thought it an imposition and disorderly in such to expect any such privilege, and I wish that Elders may exert their authority, such that the Holy

Ghost may make overseers, and that they may be preserved, so as to look well to themselves, and to the flock of Christ, and that the same powerful faith that hath been the foundation of the righteous in all ages, may be their strength and sup∣port, so as to rule well, and to be worthy of double honour, they labouring and en∣during in the spirit of love and meekness, to do the Lord's work with pure hearts and clean hands, seeking that honour that comes from God only, that he may be pleased to fulfil his gracious promise, to honour those that honour him, that by their being good examples to the flock, the youth and all that go under our name, may follow them as they follow Christ, and my heart is tenderly affected before the Lord on account of the rising youth, who are coming upon the stage of life, and are reached I believe, many of them, by the same good shepherd's voice that visit∣ed many of us, by the powerful call of grace and faith to salvation, that they may daily partake of heavenly bread, and nourishment to their souls, so as to grow strong in the Lord, and in the power of

his might, and they kept faithful to Divine Knowledge and the blessed yoke of Jesus Christ, so as to live in the fear of God, and prosper in those things that are con∣sistent with Truth's testimony, obedience to parents, true moderation, plainness of speech and apparel, and out of the vain conversation of the ungodly; for the ways of the ungodly shall perish.—And let all the tribulated and faithful followers of the Lamb, be encouraged to keep your heavenly places in Christ, for he hath told us, that
<Q>Greater is he that is in you, than they that are in the world,</Q>
and let none
<Q>be weary in welldoing, for in due time we shall reap if we faint not.</Q></P>

<SALUTE>DEAR FRIENDS;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN true and brotherly love, I take this opportunity to salute you, having been desirous according to my measure, that the Lord's glorious work and truth may prosper in your parts, and prevail to the glory and honour of his most excellent name and praise, that hath planted a num∣ber of families, not many years since in that wilderness, with a design I trust, that he might have a fruitful field or garden, yielding pleasant fruits, and be a sweet sa∣vour to him.</P>
<P>And dear Friends;</P>
<P>LET the awful sense of the great care and tender mercy, and good Providence of God towards his flock and family be thankfully remembred, so as to walk wor∣thy of his grace and goodness towards
<PB N="182" REF="012565_0197_0F8B153E275DA300"/>
you; and let the love of God in Christ prevail in your hearts, and brotherly love one towards another in the unity of the spirit, which is the bond of peace; that there may be no hurting or destroying in all the Lord's holy mountain; but a care that you may be preserved in the faith and fellowship of the saints in light, that you may be as lights and way-marks to others, ruling well in your places and stations in the church of Christ, in the meekness and patience, humility and charity, as becomes the followers of the Lamb, looking to him, the true guide of his flock, to be led in and out that you may find pasture, and the best wisdom to direct your steps in the way of peace, and establish your goings in righteousness; that you may be a peculi∣ar people zealous of good works, having a regard to truth's honour, and true mo∣deration in all things, living in the cross of Christ, more than to mind temporal things or the profits of this world, that God's righteous seed may grow and thrive in all your minds, to the bringing forth plentifully such fruits that best please him; and as you are willing to be one with the
<PB N="183" REF="012565_0198_0F8B15415427FD08"/>
pure seed, and to suffer with it, I hope you will enjoy the blessed promise of reign∣ing with the same in the Lord's time, and that all hurtful things that are like briars and thorns, which would choak or hurt this precious seed, or sow discord among brethren, may be watched and guarded against, so as not to allow of hardness of heart, prejudice, or illwill one against another, the nature of which is contrary to the heavenly peace and sweet fellowship of Christ's kingdom, that consists of peace and joy in the Holy Ghost;—and as I wish for the aged to keep their ranks in righteousness, so I desire for the youth and rising generation, that they may come up in the foot-steps of the flock of Christ's companions, and adhere unto the true monitor and just witness of Truth in their own breasts, living near to Christ, the Way, the Truth, and the Life, that they may be a people to God's praise, minding his early and tender visitations to their souls, and the good advice and care of their Godly parents and best Friends, and flee from youthful lusts and wanton∣ness, wherein many go in the way to de∣struction,

and occasion great pain and af∣fliction, sometimes to themselves and near∣est Friends when it is too late.</P>
<P>MY prayers are for their lasting welfare and for you all; and wish that brotherly love may rule and abound among you, it being
<Q>good and pleasant for brethren to dwell together in unity; it is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went down to the skirts of his garments.—As the dew of Her∣mon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Sion, for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore!</Q>

<HEAD>There being no other written Memorial of our <HI>Friend BENJAMIN TROTTER,</HI> between whom and <HI>DANIEL STANTON,</HI> a long uninterrupted friendship subsisted; it is thought the subjoining the following here, may be acceptable to <HI>Friends</HI> in general.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The TESTIMONY of the MONTHLY MEETING of FRIENDS in Philadelphia, concerning our be∣loved Friend and Brother, BENJAMIN TROTTER, who was born in this City, in the ninth Month of the Year, 1699.</HEAD>
<P>HE was one whom the Lord early visited, and reached unto by the reproofs of his Divine Light and Grace, for those youthful vanities and cor∣rupt conversation, which by nature he was prone to and pursued, to the grief of his pious mother, who was religiously con∣cerned to restrain him, but as he became obedient to the renewed visitations of the heavenly call, denying himself of those things he was reproved for, he not only learned to cease from doing evil, but to live in the practice of doing well; and continuing faithful, became an example of plainness and self-denial, for which he suffered much scoffing and mocking of those who had been his companions in fol∣ly; yet he neither fainted nor was turned aside by the reproaches of the ungodly, which thus fell to his lot, for his plain tes∣timony against their evil conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="012565_0201_0F8B15436C6101F8"/>IN the twenty-sixth year of his age, he appeared in the work of the ministry, and laboured therein in much plainness and Godly sincerity, adorning the doctrine he preached, by a humble circumspect life and conversation, being exemplary in his diligence and industry to labour honestly for a livelihood, though often in much bodily infirmity and weakness, desiring, as he sometimes expressed, that he might owe no man any thing but love. His in∣offensive openness and affability, drawing many of different denominations to con∣verse with him, he had some seasonable op∣portunities of admonishing and rebuking the evil doer and evil speaker, which he did, in the plainness of an upright zeal for the promotion of piety and virtue, temper∣ed with true brotherly kindness and cha∣rity; respecting not the person of the proud nor of the rich, because of his riches, but with Christian freedom, declaring the truth to his neighbour, and was thus in private as well as public, a preacher of righteousness.</P>
<P>IN his public ministry he was zealous a∣gainst errors both in principle and practice, and constantly concerned to press the ne∣ssity of obedience to the Principle of Divine Grace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. ii. 11.</NOTE> a manifestation of which is given to every man; knowing, from his own ex∣perience, that it bringeth salvation to all them that obey and follow it's teachings
<PB N="3" REF="012565_0202_0F8B15443042A128"/>
and was frequently enabled with energy and power to bear testimony to the out∣ward coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, his miraculous birth, his holy example in his life and precepts, and his death and sufferings at Jerusalem, by which he hath obtained eternal redemption for us.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. ix. 12 &amp; 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN his public testimony a little be∣fore his last sickness, he expressed his apprehensions, that his time among us would be short, and fervently exhorted to watchfulness and care, to keep our lamps trimmed, and our lights burning, and urged the necessity of being prepared to meet the bridegroom, as not knowing at what hour he will come.</P>
<P>HE travelled several times, and visited most of the meetings of Friends in this province and New-Jersey, and some in the adjacent provinces, but was not much from home; being upwards of forty years a diligent attender of our religious meet∣ings in this city, zealously concerned for the maintaining our Christian discipline in meekness and true charity, careful in the exercise of that part of pure religion, visiting the widow and fatherless in their afflictions, and often qualified to admi∣nister relief and consolation to their de∣jected minds.</P>
<P>AFFLICTIONS of divers kinds, and some very deep and exercising, fell to his lot through the course of his life, which
<PB N="4" REF="012565_0203_0F8B1544EF881B28"/>
he was enabled to bear with exemplary patience and resignation, and particularly through his last illness, in which, for up∣wards of six weeks, he underwent great difficulty and pain, being afflicted with the asthma and dropsy, so that he suffered much, yet was never heard to utter a mur∣mur or complaint, but frequently expres∣sed his thankfulness, that he had not more pain, and often engaged in prayer, that he might be preserved in patience to the end, which was graciously granted him; so that he was capable of speaking to the comfort and edification of those who visit∣ed him; and from the fervent love of the brethren, which evidently appeared thro' his life, and most conspicuously during his last illness, and even in the hour of his death, we have a well-grounded as∣surance that he is passed unto life, and hath received the reward of the Righte∣ous.</P>
<P>HIS body was attended by a great number of Friends and others, his fellow-citizens of divers religious denominations, to our Meeting-house in High-street, on the 24th of the third month, 1768, and after a solemn Meeting, in which several living testimonies were borne, was inter∣red in our burial ground in this city.</P>
