<P>THIS Day the Commissioners being arrived at St. <HI>George</HI>'s, were inform'd by <HI>Jabez Bradbury,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Commander of the Fort, That there were only Two Indians of the <HI>Penobscott</HI> Tribe now in the Fort; but that he understood there was a Number of the <HI>Norridgawock</HI> Indians at <HI>Richmond</HI> who had been waiting sometime for the Arrival of the Commissioners; whereupon the Commissioners immediately dispatch'd an Express to Capt. <HI>Lithgow</HI> at <HI>Richmond</HI> Fort, directing him forthwith to come with as many of the Chief∣of the <HI>Norridgawock</HI> and other Tribes of Indians as were there; and another Express to the <HI>Penobscotts,</HI> by one of that Tribe, informing them of their Arrival here, and that they were now waiting for them in order to proceed on the Treaty.</P>

In the Evening the Commissioners were inform'd that Capt. <HI>Lithgow</HI> was at <HI>Pleasant-Point</HI> with a Number of the <HI>Norridgawock</HI> Indians, and would be at the Fort in the Morning. The Commissioners then sent a Messenger to recall the Ex∣press dispatch'd to Capt. <HI>Lithgow</HI> in the Forenoon.</P>

<P>THIS Morning Capt. <HI>Lithgow,</HI> together with the <HI>Norridgawock</HI> Indians that were with him, came in; and after the usual Salutations had pass'd between the Commissioners and the Indians, the Commissioners told them, that they had sent an Express to the <HI>Penobscott</HI> Indians, informing them of their Arrival; and as they expected in a few Days to see them, should delay the Treaty until they came in; but in the mean Time had directed Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI> to provide for their Subsistence.</P>

<P>A Number of the <HI>Penobscotts</HI> arriving this Afternoon, with Col. <HI>Louis</HI> one of their Chiefs, and after Salutations had pass'd, Col. <HI>Louis</HI> desired a Time might be set to begin the Conference; and propos'd To-Morrow at Three o'Clock in the Afternoon: To which the Commissioners agreed; and told them they wou'd give them Notice of the Time, by firing a Cannon.</P>

<P>THE Commissioners being seated in the Parade of the Fort, and a Number of Indians of the <HI>Penobscott</HI> and <HI>Norridgawock</HI> Tribes, as also two of the St. <HI>John</HI>'s Tribe being present, they were inform'd, that an Oath wou'd be now administred to Capt. <HI>Joseph Beane,</HI> and to <HI>Walter Mc'Farland</HI> faithfully to Interpret what should be said at this Conference, both by the English and Indians; and also to Mr. <HI>Ezekiel Price</HI> truly to enter all Matters that should pass between the Commissioners and the Indians at this Conference.</P>
<P>Which Oaths were accordingly administred by Col. <HI>Wendell.</HI></P>
<P>Then Col. <HI>Wendell,</HI> in the Name of the Commissioners, said as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<SP>
<P><HI>Friends and Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>IN Consequence of a Commission from his Honour Governour <HI>PHIPS</HI> to us (and Col. <HI>Heath</HI> since deceas'd,) we embark'd for St. <HI>George's</HI> the last Year; and came hither with full Power to ratify and confirm the Treaty of Peace made at <HI>Falmouth</HI> in 1749, (founded on Governour DUMMER'S in 1726,) But as that Treaty was broke in upon in several Instances, by some of the Tribes ot Indians included therein, particularly, (as is suppos'd) by the <HI>Norridgawock</HI>'s 
<PB N="5" REF="006861_0004_102A7E7DB55F77A8"/>
killing and captivating several of the Inhabitants of this Province, as also by com∣mitting other Acts of Hostility; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Tribe not being here, it was then agreed by us and the <HI>Penobscotts</HI> to deter the Conference till they could prevail on the <HI>Norridgawocks</HI> to come in, which they engag'd to use their Endeavours to do, and give Notice thereof to Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI> accordingly.</P>
<P>But the Government hearing nothing of the <HI>Norridgawock</HI>'s Disposition for or De∣sires of a Treaty, till the 16th of last Month, by a Letter (which if you desire shall be n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w read to you) from a Number of that Tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the Governour, desiring him to come himself (if he could) or appoint some other Gentlemen for that Pur∣pose, readily agreed thereto; but as the Affairs of the Province would not permit the Governour to appear in Person, he hath again sent us fully impowered to treat with you. Now,</P>
<P>Friends and Brethren,</P>
<P>We give Thanks to almighty GOD for the Preservation of you and us, and giving us this Opportunity of seeing each other in Health.</P>
<P>We hope you appear fully impowered on your Part to go upon the Business we are met upon.</P>
<P>However, Before we proceed, we can't but take Notice of the unfriendly Behaviour of the <HI>Norridgawocks</HI>; who, after some of their Tribe were kindly receiv'd and enter∣tain'd at <HI>Boston,</HI> return'd and repeatedly came upon our Frontiers; kill'd divers of our People, and carried others into Captivity, and also destroyed their Cattle: And, besides this, one of their People return'd the Treaty made at <HI>Falmouth</HI> in 1749, deliver'd it to Capt. <HI>Lithgow</HI> at <HI>Richmond</HI>; which looks as if they made no Ac∣count of it; Therefore we expect they will let us know, whether this latter was the Act of their Tribe, or done only by a particular Indian, without their Order and Consent.</P>
<P>The English are disposed for the Continuance of Peace; and as a Proof thereof, the Government have directed us to assure you, That upon the Renewal of your Friendship with them, and so long as you (and the other Tribes of Eastern Indians) shall continue in Amity with the English, and keep firm and inviolable the Peace made; they may depend upon receiving from the Government, in the Month of <HI>October</HI> annually, a suitable Present in Token of the Friendship subsisting between them and this Government; which we, in the Name of the Government, accordingly now do.</P></Q>

<P>Had you a Meeting in Council before you came away?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quincius,</SPEAKER>
<P>a <HI>Norridgawock.</HI> We had a Meeting in great Council some Time ago, and our Brethren, the Indians of our Tribe, advised us to come here.</P>
<P>All that we do, the Indians will agree to, and like well, as they know of our coming.</P>
</SP>
<P>Capt. <HI>Ligthow</HI> being present, address'd the Commissioners, and inform'd them, That a Number of the <HI>Norridgawock</HI> Tribe of Indians appeared at <HI>Richmond</HI> Fort sometime ago; who told him, they wou'd have attended at this Treaty; but it being the Season for Hunting, they were obliged to go out; and withal said, that what these Indians, who now appeared in behalf of that Tribe, agreed to, would be the Act of the whole Tribe.</P>

<P>The Indians acquainted the Commissioners, after the Business was finished, some fresh Meat would be very acceptable to them: The Commissioners told them an Ox should be given them when they had Mind to receive it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>WE are now ready to hear what you have to offer to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louis.</SPEAKER>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>YOU were pleas'd Yesterday to tell us, We were but few in Number, which was true; but yet, if we were but Four, it is the same, as if all the Tribe was present.</P>
<P>There is a Number of the <HI>Norridgawock</HI> Tribe and two of the St. <HI>John's</HI> Tribe here; you will hear what they have to say to you.</P>
<P>There has of late Mischief been done among us; but now we are all come to bury it: In order whereto, we are for proceeding upon Governour DUMMER's Treaty, by which it was concluded, That the English should inhabit the Lands as far as the Salt-Water flowed, and no further; and that the Indians should possess the rest. Now,</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>We desire that both you and we should endeavour, to the best we can, to observe this Treaty; which if we do will end in Peace.</P>
<P>We again say, That we will follow Mr. DUMMER's Treaty; and either of us that act contrary to it, let him be punish'd; and, if either Party have acted contrary hereunto, let it now be setled, and not go any further, least it lay the Foundation of a War between us.</P>
<P>All the Tribes of Indians knew that there was to be a Treaty here, and have consented to it.</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>As I said before, so I now say, That the Lands we own, let us enjoy; and let no Body take them from us. We said the same to those of our own Religion, the <HI>French.</HI> Altho' we are a Black People, yet GOD hath planted us here: GOD gave us this Land, and we will keep it. GOD decreed all Things; He decreed this Land to us; therefore neither shall the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>English</HI> possess it, but we will. This is agreeable both to King GEORGE and the <HI>French</HI> King; they wou'd have neither the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>French</HI> disturb us in our Right; which if they should, would set all these Lands on Fire.</P>
<P>What I say, all the Indians now present say.</P></Q>

<P>What Brother <HI>Louis</HI> hath said, We of our Tribe confirm the same.</P>

<P>One Word more I have to say to your Honours,</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>IT is but seldom we can see the Faces of each other in Conferences, which we are sorry for, and should be glad it was oftner. Therefore, Let me speak to you as to the Trade.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="006861_0007_102A7E83EB764FF0"/>
Altho' our Beaver fetches a great Sum, it will purchase but a small Matter of your Goods. The Custom is, Where Persons sell the Cheapest, there we go to Trade; particularly to <HI>Albany,</HI> tho' it is at a great Distance, yet many go there to Trade, because they sell good Pennyworths, and give a good Price for Beaver.</P>
<P>Brethren,</P>
<P>Lay these Things up in-your Hearts, and carry them Home with you.</P>
<P>If Goods could be sold as cheap here, as at <HI>Albany,</HI> and you would give as much for Beaver as they do; all the Indians would look upon this Place; would come here and Trade.</P></Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon our return Home we will mention to the Government what you have now said relating to the Price of Goods supplied you; and Justice shall be done you therein.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yesterday we mention'd to you that the Treaty made at <HI>Falmouth</HI> in the Year 1749, was delivered up to Capt. <HI>Lithgow,</HI> at <HI>Richmond</HI> Fort; to which you have said nothing: We now demand of you an Answer to this Question, Was it delivered up by Order of the whole Tribe of the <HI>Norridgawocks,</HI> or was it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louis.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Treaty was not sent in by the whole Tribe of the <HI>Norridgawocks,</HI> for they know nothing of it; but, as I am inform'd, it was only deliver'd up by one Man of that Tribe.</P>

<P>Was that Treaty delivered up by Order of the whole of your Tribe, or was it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quinoius.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was not sent in by Order of the whole of our Tribe; but only delivered to Capt. <HI>Lithgow</HI> by a single Person for him to keep.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is that Treaty now; have you taken it from Capt. <HI>Lithgow,</HI> or has he it with him?</P>

<P>Col. <HI>Wendell</HI> holding that Treaty in his Hand, spake to the <HI>Penobscott</HI> and <HI>Norridgawock</HI> Tribes, and said, This is the Treaty made at <HI>Falmouth</HI> Three Years ago; of which Mr. DUMMER's Treaty is the Basis; come and see the Hands and Marks of such of your Trib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and others that signed it.

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The said Treaty is herewith re-printed in Pag. 14, 15</NOTE>; and upon the first Article observed to the Indians, that they were bound to deliver the Captives that had been taken by them at their own Cost and Charge; that they expected it of them; and that they should do it with all possible speed.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commiss.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the first Article now read, you are obliged to return the Captives; and therefore we expect it of you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quinious.</SPEAKER>
<P>What can we do, as to the returning them? The little Ones that were taken, according to our Custom, those who take them, keep them for their own; others turn to our Religion, and we can't force them away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commiss.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must again insist upon your returning the Captives that have been taken by you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quinious.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you demand we will do: It is the Fall of the Year now; and we cannot go for them: In the Spring we will go, and they shall be returned.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commiss.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is doing there, is by private Persons who imagine they have an undoubted Right to those Lands; and that if the Title of those Persons shou'd be good, it is not agreable to the Constitution of our Government to dispossess Men of their Right: However, You may depend upon it, that the Government will examine into their Title to those Lands, and endeavour to give you Satisfaction in this Point when you receive your Presents the next Year.</P>

<P>We dislike your Hunters, hunting on our Ground: They hunt as far as <HI>Norridgawock,</HI> and thereby spoil our Game, and hurt us greatly.</P>

<P>Friends and Brethren,</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>IN the Morning you mentioned to us the Article of Trade; which you desire may be agreeable to Covernour DUMMER's Treaty, inasmuch as the Beaver you bring in, (tho' it sells for a great Sum yet) fetches but little of our Goods. To which we reply, That if it be more agreable to you, to six your Furrs at the Prices they were at in Governour DUMMER's Time; we are ready to agree that you shall have our Goods at that Price also: But would endeavour to convince you, that as the Trade is now carried on, it is more to your Advantage; that is, you get more 
<PB N="11" REF="006861_0010_102A7E8D4A40B5C8"/>
Profit now, than you did in Governour DUMMER's Day: And here we will give you one Instance; Then you gave us Five Pounds of Spring Beaver for Eight Gal∣lons of Rum; but now you give us but Four Pounds for that Quantity; and so it is as to most of the other Articles, both of Furrs and Goods. We are perswaded you must be mistaken as to your Furrs selling better at <HI>Albany</HI> than here, inasmuch as the Merchants who purchase your Beaver there, send it to <HI>Boston</HI> for a Market; which they would never do, if they did not buy it at such a Rate as to give them some Profit.</P>
<P>However, You may depend on Justice being done you, both as to the Prices of our Goods, as well as of your Furs.</P></Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louis.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have made no Answer as to the Ground being turn'd over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commiss.</SPEAKER>
<P>To-Morrow we shall sign the Treaty, as agreed to this Morning: The Hatchet is now buried; every Thing is forgot, as tho' it never had been; provided the <HI>Norridgawocks</HI> perform their Promise with respect to their bringing in the Captive Children; which we again tell you we absolutely depend upon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louis.</SPEAKER>
<P>We pray you wou'd not let our Women have any Rum, nor our young Men too much least they should do Mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commiss.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Motion is quite pleasing to us: Rum destroys the Constitution▪ and is the Cause of much Evil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louis.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have had great and long Experience of Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI>'s Fidelity: The Lieutenant is a good Truck-Master; it wou'd do your Hearts good to see how kind he is to us, and how justly he treats us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commiss.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are glad that the Government has such faithfull Officers; and that they please you so well.</P>
<P>We are inform'd, your young Men come to Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI> for great Quanti∣ties of Rum; if he refuses them, they tell him that he is only a Servant to the Government, and that they will lay out their Money as they please: Therefore, We intreat you to give a strict Charge to them not to spend their Money in Rum: and as you desire your Women should not have any Rum, pray take care not to send them for it; or if you do, be not offended if Capt. <HI>Bradbury</HI> refuses them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some of our young Men love Rum too much: They are sometimes drunk by the Fort in the Winter-Time, and almost ready to perish with Cold. We desire that Care may be taken that they do not perish, and that a Shelter be built for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commiss.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where would you have a Shelter built?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Louis.</SPEAKER>
