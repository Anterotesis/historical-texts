<P>I KNOW it has been thought, that <HI>I was afraid</HI> to publish an account of the prosecution car∣ried on against me by the State Government of Pennsylvania, at the instance of the Spanish Minister. I can readily excuse people for en∣tertaining this opinion, because the American press is become the most tame, the most hum∣bled, the most abject upon the face of the earth; and because I count it no dishonour not to be thought a match for the dangers to which I am exposed. The opinion will, however, be found to be eroneous. I have, in the following sheets, exhibited this unparalleled proceeding to the world in its true colours; and I take this oppor∣tunity of declaring my fixed determination to persevere in rendering equally notorious, every fact, of which such like proceedings shall put me in possession.—My daily occupations leave me but little time for undertakings of this sort; but my just resentment, though slow in its ope∣ration, shall not be less sure in its effects.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>JUDGE M'KEAN, the Chief Justice of Penn∣sylvania, in his charge to the Grand Jury (of which the reader will see enough by-and-by), observed, that
<Q><HI>the liberty of the press</HI> was a phrase much used, but little understood.</Q>
This, in a <HI>public servant,</HI> as all the democratic officers call themselves, is making pretty free with the un∣derstanding of the sovereign people, and of a people too whom the Congress have declared <HI>free</HI> and <HI>enlightened,</HI> and would have declared the "<HI>free-est</HI> and most <HI>enlightened in the world,</HI>" had it not been for their desire
<Q>to avoid all <HI>cause of offence</HI></Q>
towards the <HI>free</HI> and <HI>enlightened</HI> French.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Censor</HI> for December, 1796, for a full account of this humiliating business.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Judge was certainly wrong. No people understand what the liberty of the press means better than the Americans do. No one knows so well how to appreciate the value of a thing, as he who has long enjoyed, and then lost it.
<PB N="6" REF="033523_0004_0FF771CE843A6D90"/>
Had the Judge called the liberty of the press a thing much talked about, much boasted of, and <HI>very little enjoyed,</HI> I would most readily have sub∣scribed to his assertion; for, of all the countries under the Sun, where <HI>unlicensed</HI> presses are tol∣erated, I am bold to declare, and the contents of this pamphlet will establish the truth of my de∣claration, that none ever enjoyed less <HI>real</HI> liber∣ty of the press than America has for some years past.</P>
<P>I do not say, that this liberty has been abridg∣ed by any positive law; on the contrary, I know well, that several of the State Constitutions hold out a something (not very intelligible to be sure) that would seem to extend the liberty of printing beyond the limits prescribed by the English law. Nor do I pretend, that this dangerous abridgment of American freedom is to be attributed to tho change, which the revolution has produced in the name and nature of the government. I will not, for a moment, be said to insinuate, that the press is become not free, merely because the go∣vernment is become <HI>republican.</HI> No; I think, the people, when they adopted this form of go∣vernment, expected, as they certainly <HI>were led to expect,</HI> an extention of this, and every other important branch of their liberties. What I contend for, is, that, some how or other, this liberty has been abridged; the exercise of it, ei∣ther by popular prejudice, by the influence of party, the fear of mobish violence, or of govern∣mental tyranny, has been, and yet is, most shame∣fully and disgracefully <HI>restrained.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="033523_0005_0FF771D2A69814C8"/>To enter into the causes, which have produc∣ed this fatal effect, would be to revive the re∣membrance of what I wish may ever remain buried in oblivion. I will therefore content myself with <HI>proving the fact;</HI> and to do this to the satisfaction of every candid mind, I need go no farther back than my own times.</P>
<P>When I first came to Philadelphia, I was charmed with the literary liberty, which its inha∣bitants seemed to enjoy. I saw pamphlets in every window, and news-papers in every hand. I was, indeed rather surprised to find, that those pamphlets, and these news-papers were, some∣thing like <HI>a certain Judge</HI> that I had heard of, <HI>all on one side:</HI> but, said I to myself, this must be the fault of the authors and editors; and it leaves, the more room for such as have a mind to write on the other side. With this agreeable but delusive notion in my brain, I sat down con∣tented under the calamity of reading daily, in common with my poor fellow citizens, about eighteen or twenty long columns of the vilest and most insipid trash that ever was stamped up∣on paper.</P>
<P>Long did I hope, and expect, to see some∣thing like a manly and effectual opposition to this flood of falshood and partiality; but I ho∣ped and expected in vain. At last, it was <HI>my</HI> fate to enter the field. I had long felt a be∣coming indignation at the atrocious slander that was continually vomitted forth against Great Bri∣tain; and the malignancy of Priestley and his addressers at New-York brought it into action.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="033523_0006_0FF771D57AC067C0"/>The OBSERVATIONS on the emigration of this restless and ambitious demagogue contain, as I have elsewhere remarked,
<Q>not one untruth, one anarchical, indecent, immoral, or irreligi∣ous expression</Q>;
yet, when I came to offer it for the press, the bookseller was afraid it was not <HI>popular enough.</HI> He was far, as he said, from disapproving of the work; but it was <HI>too much in favour of Great Britain,</HI> and on this account he thought it would endanger his <HI>windows,</HI> if not his <HI>person.</HI></P>
<P>This mans fears seemed to me perfectly ab∣surd. The pamphlet said not a word in praise of Great Britain, generally. Indeed, policy had led me to speak rather harshly of that nation in one passage or two; and so evident was this, that the <HI>British Critics,</HI> though they pay the author compliments far beyond his merit, cannot for∣bear to lament, they say, that so enlightened a mind should still harbour <HI>a rancour so implacable.</HI> These people, though certainly not less pene∣trating than GOOSY TOM in the common affairs of literature, would have laughed at the idea of broken windows and basted carcasses.</P>
<P>However, notwithstanding the ridicule, which this remark of the BRITISH CRITICS is calcu∣lated to throw on the apprehensions of my book∣seller, now the <HI>worthy partner</HI> of LLOYD, sub∣sequent events have proved, that those appre∣hensions were not entirely groundless: for, al∣though he did publish several succeeding pam∣phlets from the same pen, without incurring a penalty of any kind, yet no sooner was the <HI>real author</HI> known, than he began to see, and to feel
<PB N="9" REF="033523_0007_0FF771D824A18870"/>
too, that BRADFORD understood the <HI>American liberty of the press</HI> far better than he did.</P>
<P>During the publication of the rest of the pam∣phlets that issued from BRADFORD's, I had of∣ten to contend with his scruples and his fears. In particular, I remember, that my calling the French minister ADET, no <HI>Christian,</HI> was very hard to be surmounted. The French had open∣ly and most blasphemously <HI>abolished the Christian religion</HI>; and the Convention, who had sent out this embassador, had even formally <HI>denied the being of a God</HI>; yet, so high was this bookseller's notions of the <HI>liberty of the press,</HI> that he was afraid to publish a sentence, in which the French minister was said <HI>not to be a Christian</HI>! If as much had been said of the English minister, though false, he would, I am pretty confident have had no scruples at all.</P>
<P>It was no sooner discovered that I was PETER PORCUPINE, and that I had taken the excel∣lent house and shop, that I now occupy, in or∣der to carry on the printing and bookselling business, than the French faction began to mus∣ter their forces and put themselves in battle array. Several infamous publications appeared in BACHE's paper, declaring me to be a <HI>deserter,</HI> a <HI>felon,</HI> a <HI>thief</HI> who had fled from the <HI>gallows,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>Strong in my innocence I steadily pursued my course, and, thank God, my steadiness was at∣tended with success. Stung at the contempt with which I treated these abominable attempts on my character, another mode of injuring me
<PB N="10" REF="033523_0008_0FF771DADDCECC60"/>
was fallen upon. A <HI>threatning letter</HI> was con∣veyed under the door of my landlord, the base object of which the letter itself will best explain. It is a performance that should ever find a place in a work that treats of the
<Q>unrestrained liberty of the press.</Q>
Here it is.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A certain William Cobbett, alias Peter Porcupine, I am informed is your te∣nant. This daring scoundrel, not satisfied with having repeatedly traduced the people of this country, vilified the most eminent and patriotic characters among us <HI>and grossly abus∣ed our allies the French,</HI> in his detestable pro∣ductions, has now the <HI>astonishing effrontry</HI> to expose those very publications at his win∣dow for sale, as well as certain prints indica∣tive of the <HI>prowess of our enemies the British and the disgrace of the French.</HI> Calculating largely upon the moderation or rather pusilla∣nimity of our citizens, this puppy supposes he may even insult us with impunity. But he will e'er long find himself dreadfully mistaken. 'Tho' his miserable publications have not been hitherto considered worthy of notice, the late manifestation of his impudence and enmity to this country will not be passed over. With a view therefore of preventing your feeling <HI>the blow</HI> designed for him, I now address you. When the time of retribution arrives, it may not be convenient to discriminate between the innocent and the guilty. Your property there∣fore
<PB N="11" REF="033523_0009_0FF771DC60DD6420"/>
may suffer. For depend upon it brick walls will not skreen the rascal from punish∣ment <HI>when once the business is undertaken.</HI> As a friend therefore I advise you to save your property by either compelling Mr. Porcupine to <HI>leave your house</HI> or at all events oblige him <HI>to cease exposing his obominable productions</HI> or any of his <HI>courtly prints</HI> at his window for sale. In this way only you may avoid danger to your house and perhaps save the rotten car∣cass of your tenant for the present.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>It will be remembered, that I instantly pub∣lished this letter, accompanied with comments, in which I set the authors (for they were many) at defiance; but I did not mention then a cir∣cumstance that it is proper I should mention now. There was, on the morning in which I received the letter, one of the <HI>judges</HI> in my shop. I show∣ed it him, and apprized him of my intention of publishing it in the manner I afterwards did; but he advised me against it, for <HI>fear</HI> of <HI>the con∣sequences.</HI> This proves his opinion with respect to the <HI>protection</HI> the liberty of the press would receive in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>No violence, however, did succeed. But the election for members of Congress was approach∣ing; and, as the <HI>free</HI> men would then be assem∣bled, it was feared by my friends; indeed, it was generally understood, and publickly talked of, that, on the election night, <HI>my house was to be gutted.</HI> And, lest the <HI>sons of liberty</HI> should
<PB N="12" REF="033523_0010_0FF771DF1BEA35B0"/>
be uninformed of the business, and consequent∣ly unprepared for it, the same wretch BACHE (the Grandson and pupil of Old Franklin) re∣minded them of it by an inflammatory publica∣tion signed AN AMERICAN, which, after a series of the most atrocious falshoods, concludes thus:
<LETTER>
<P>—while I am a friend to the <HI>unlimited</HI> free∣dom of the press, when exercised by <HI>an Ame∣rican,</HI> I am an implacable foe to its prostituti∣on to a <HI>foreig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er,</HI> and would at any time assist in hunting out of society, any meddling fo∣reigner, who should dare to interfere in our politics. I hope the <HI>apathy</HI> of our brethren of Philadelphia will no longer be indulged, and that an <HI>exemplary vengeance</HI> will soon burst upon the head of such a presumptuous fellow.—<HI>Justice, honour, national gratitude,</HI> all call for it.—May it <HI>no longer be delayed.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>An American.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The American who can read this without blushing is an object of contempt, of scorn; a neutralized animal that has no idea of national honour, and that would sell his country, were it in his power, for a single Louis d'or. Yet such there are, and in abundance too.</P>
<P>A publication like this, the direct and avowed object of which was, to instigate the <HI>free</HI> men to devastation and <HI>murder,</HI> should, one would think, have been noticed by the magistrates, par∣ticularly under the eye of a <HI>Chief Justice,</HI> whom we shall by-and-by see so zealous and so watchful. But, no. It attracted the attention of no one, or at least no one took any measures
<PB N="13" REF="033523_0011_0FF771E336F81CF0"/>
to prevent the intended assault. My house and my family might have been burnt to ashes; we might all have been dragged into the street and murdered, and, I sincerely believe, not so much as a constable would have held up his staff to ar∣rest the assassins We were, however, prepared for their reception. We should not have fallen unrevenged. Some of their souls would have taken their departure from my door-way on their journey to hell.</P>
<P>It is here that I ought, and that I do with pleasure, acknowledge the generosity of several gentlemen of the city (many of whom I never saw), who I was afterwards assured, had formed the resolution to summon the magistrates, and to come to my aid in person. One gentleman in particular, whom I did not then know even by name, went in disguise among the groups of <HI>free</HI> men to endeavour to find out their intention. I wish I <HI>durst</HI> name him now; but my <HI>gratitude</HI> to him forbids me to do it. When <HI>liberty</HI> comes to this pitch, I think it ought to assume some other name.</P>
<P>But, what was the most shameful, and what is most directly to the point before us, was, this au∣dacious, this cut-throat attack on the liberty of the press, was suffered to pass unnoticed, not on∣ly by all the other presses in this city, but by all the presses in the continent. There are, perhaps, two or three hundred news-papers published in the United States, and not one of them have ever whispered a word in condemnation of it, from that day to this.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="033523_0012_0FF771E65926A4F8"/>If, however, it was proper to destroy me; if "<HI>Justice, honour,</HI> and <HI>national gratitude</HI>" de∣manded my blood for exercising the liberty of the press, that same "<HI>Justice, honour</HI> and <HI>nation∣al gratitude</HI>" did, it seems, require my enemies to exercise that liberty in <HI>perfect safety.</HI> No less than seven pamphlets were, in this city, publish∣ed against me in the space of ten days. It is a pity they cannot now be found above ground. Had they lived, they would have been a lasting honour to the country that gave them birth, and particularly to the <HI>equal</HI> laws and <HI>impartial judi∣ciary</HI> that tolerated them. They were, all toge∣ther, a composition of brutality, slander, and vil∣lainy of every sort and description, that would have disgraced hell itself. The anonymous scoundrels who wrote them vied with each other in baseness and atrocity; and one of them, who seemed resolved to have the pre-eminence in in∣famy, and for whom everlasting damnation is too mild a punishment, insinuated <HI>that my wife was a whore!</HI>—And all this, only because I had written with success against a nefarious French faction. This is <HI>American liberty of the press!</HI></P>
<P>Were I to set about recounting all the in∣stances of persecution I have experienced; all the menaces I have received; all the vexations through the channel of the post-office, &amp;c. &amp;c. I could fill fifty volumes like this. The written threats, which I have now by me, to assassinate or poison me, or fire my house, amount to some hundreds. Nor is this species of baseness con∣fined to this city or this state. There is hardly a post mark of an American town, which I can∣not, and which <HI>I will not,</HI> show stamped on some
<PB N="15" REF="033523_0013_0FF771E82853C2D0"/>
infamous production, intended, in some way or other, to restrain the liberty of my press.</P>
<P>I shall wind up this series of injuries, of base machinations and brutal autrage, that have been attempted against me, with an anecdote, which cannot fail to give the reader a high opinion of the decency, candour and justice to be met with in Pennsylvania.—A great beef-headed purblind creature, that calls itself a young lawyer, and whose pleading bears an infinite resemblance to the bleating of an overgrown calf, observed to * * * * * just before the court sat, that it was quite wrong to honour me with a <HI>legal</HI> punishment; and that, if I had censured him, as I had done some other of the <HI>patriots,</HI> he would have clapped a pistol to my <HI>breast</HI> and blowed my <HI>brains</HI> out!—There now, leaving the <HI>bull</HI> aside, is a noble sentiment for you! What sort of justice has a man to expect, where such language can, <HI>in such company,</HI> be held with impunity?—However, I will never fly to the law to shelter me from the vengence of this bel∣lowing animal, who, instead of standing erect before the bench, ought to be placed on all fours before a rack and manger. I will never fly to the law, or to any thing else, to shelter me from the soft horns of this half-grown, blink∣ing, bloated cornuto.</P>
<P>I should now enter into a recital of the perse∣cutions, of various sorts, which other printers, not devoted to the French, have experienced; but this would lead me too far. I cannot, how∣ever, omit noticing one remarkable instance of <HI>patriotic liberality</HI> and <HI>justice.</HI></P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Richmond, Virginia,</HI>
<DATE><HI>April</HI> 4, 1794.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>About two weeks ago, a piece was published in the Virginia Gazette, requesting all true re∣publicans <HI>to wear the national cockade,</HI> in <HI>ho∣our of France,</HI> which, it seems, was not well re∣ceived by the Aristocrats. The next day ano∣ther piece came out, in another of your pa∣pers, signed, "<HI>A foe to distinctions,</HI>" ridiculing the measure, comparing those citizens who adopted it to fools and madmen, which so irri∣tated the <HI>republican party,</HI> that some of them waited on the printer, and demanded the au∣thor. He told them, he did not know who he was, and would go before a magistrate and <HI>take his oath of it.</HI> I assure you he was <HI>greatly alarmed</HI> on the occasion, and I think has lost much of his interest by it.—They were not sa∣tisfied with this; but, in the evening erected a <HI>gallows,</HI> fixed it on a waggon carriage, hung the poor fellow up in effigy, and paraded through the streets beating the <HI>rogue's</HI> march. At last they stopped before the post-office door, and burnt him with repeated shouts and huzzas.—I am confident, if they could have found the author, he would have suffered the <HI>same fate</HI> as the effigy; at least they would have complimented him with a suit of <HI>Ameri∣can</HI> manufacture, extracted from the <HI>lofty pine,</HI> and the filling taken from a <HI>goose.</HI>—You see what the Virginians <HI>dare</HI> do—what they do to enemies of <HI>liberty</HI>—and I sincerely hope all who are inimical to the cause of America, <HI>or France,</HI> may meet a similar reward.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="17" REF="033523_0015_0FF771EF306A4980"/>This extract is taken from BACHE'S paper, No. 1044; and the circumstances of the base transaction that it recounts were pretty exactly as it describes them. This printer was exhibited as a <HI>rogue</HI> that merited to be <HI>hung</HI> and <HI>burnt</HI>; and his author if found, would have actually suffered this ignominious fate: and all this for writ∣ing and publishing—what?—A sensible essay, advising the people not to make themselves appear like fools and madmen, by adopting the fantas∣tical fopperies, or rather by ranging themselves under the colours, of a <HI>foreign nation!</HI>—Will any one pretend to say, that, in a country where such unjust, tyrannical, and inhuman proceed∣ings could take place, and pass unpunished and unnoticed by the civil power; will any one have the effrontery to say, that, in such a coun∣try, there is any thing worthy of being called, <HI>the liberty of the press</HI>?—But, no more. It is mere mockery to talk of it.</P>
<P>Now, in answer to all this, some precious vil∣lain, deep leaned in the jargon of the <HI>Rights of Man</HI>; or some temporizing drivler from the canting school of <HI>modern republicanism</HI>: some infamous BACHE or trimming NOAH WEBSTER, will tell me that nothing which I have here ad∣vanced, tends to prove the press to be in thral∣dom. They will say, that so long as it remains unshackled by <HI>the law</HI>! so long as <HI>the law</HI> does not invade its liberty, it is <HI>free.</HI>—No; it is not so. The law is made to <HI>protect</HI> the weak and the injured, as well as to punish the guilty. The law which declares, that a man shall have such or such a right, guarantees to him the <HI>enjoyment</HI> of that right therefore, the law which says,
<PB N="18" REF="033523_0016_0FF771F0B401ACC8"/>
that "<HI>the printing presses shall be free,</HI>" pledges the faith and honour of the nation to <HI>protect them in the exercise of their freedom</HI>; and to fail in yielding them this protection, is as much a breach of the national saith as is an actual inva∣sion of this freedom by the law; for, where is the difference to the printer, whether the law itself restrain his press, or suffer it to be restrain∣ed? I think I hate <HI>a tyrant</HI> (and I think <HI>I have reason</HI>) as much as most men do! but I would much rather a tyrant should order my rights to be surpressed, than have them rifled from me by his tools, a brutal and ferocious mob</P>
<P>For want of this so necessary protection it is, that the infernal French faction have, aided by certain men in power in most of the State Govern∣ments, got the <HI>real</HI> liberty of the press into their possession, to the almost general exclusion of their opponents. For want of this protection it is, that the friends of the Federal Government have been abashed, humbled, silenced, and, in many instances, induced to <HI>change sides</HI>: and, it is for want of this protection, that we at this mo∣ment see such numbers of insipid, tame and trimming papers, which, under the cowardly guise of <HI>impartiality,</HI> are a disgrace to literature, a dishonour to the country, a clog to the go∣vernment, and a curse to the people.</P>
<P>I have now, I think, and in pretty plain language too, proved, that, some way or other, the liberty of the American press has been most scandalously attacked and restrained, notwith∣standing the <HI>law</HI> declares, <HI>it shall be perfectly free.</HI> What the law itself, and those who admi∣nister
<PB N="19" REF="033523_0017_0FF771F3B4BB9688"/>
that law, are capable of performing in this way, under the <HI>free</HI> and <HI>equal</HI> and <HI>lenient</HI> and <HI>humane</HI> government of poor Pennsylvania, it is the object of the following pamphlet to ex∣pose to a deceived and infatuated world.</P>

<HEAD><HI>AMERICAN LIBERTY</HI> of the <HI>PRESS,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I undertook the publishing of a daily paper, it was with the intention of annihilating, if possible, the intriguing, wicked, and indefati∣gable faction, which the French had formed in this country. I was fully aware of the arduousness of the task, and of the inconvenience and dan∣ger to which it would expose both me and mine. I was prepared to meet the rancorous vengence of enemies in the hour of their triumph, and the coolness of friends in the hour of my peril: in short, to acquire riches seemed to me quite uncertain, and to be stripped of every farthing of my property seemed extremely probable; but let what would happen, I was resolved to pur∣sue the contemplated object, as long as there remained the most distant probability of success.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="033523_0019_0FF771FF5DFD5E40"/>Among the dangers, which presented them∣selves to me, those to be apprehended from the severity of the law appeared the most formidable; more especially as I happened to be situated <HI>in the State of Pennsylvania,</HI> where the government, generally speaking, was in the hands of those, who had (and sometimes with great indecency) manifested an uniform partial∣lity for the sans-culotte French, and as unifom an opposition to the ministers and measures of the Federal Government. These persons I knew I had offended by the promulgation of disagreeable truths; and, therefore, it was na∣tural, that I should seek for some standard as a safe rule for my conduct with respect to <HI>the liber∣ty of my press.</HI></P>
<P>To set about the study of the law of <HI>libels,</HI> to wade through fifty volumes of mysterious tauto∣logy, was what I had neither time nor patience to do. The English press was said to be <HI>ensla∣ved</HI>; but, when I came to consult the practice of this enslaved press, I found it still to be far <HI>too free</HI> for me to attempt to follow its example. Finally, it appeared to me to be the safest way, to form to myself some rule founded on the liber∣ty exercised by the <HI>American press.</HI> I conclud∣ed, that I might, without danger, go as great lengths in attacking the enemies of the country as others went in attacking its friends: that as much zeal might be shown in defending the Ge∣neral Government and administration as in ac∣cusing and traducing them: and that as great warmth would be admissible in the cause of virtue, order, and religion, as had long been tolerated in the wicked cause of villainy,
<PB N="23" REF="033523_0020_0FF77205947CACB8"/>
insurrection, and blasphemy. What ever ran∣cour might be harboured against me in the breasts of particular persons, I depended on <HI>shame</HI> to restrain the arm of power: I thought no officer or officers of state, would, in this country, dare to deal towards an honest man with a rigour which had never been experienc∣ed by the vilest of miscreants. Alas!
<Q>all this I thought, and all I thought was wrong;</Q>
as the following sheets will most clearly evince.</P>
<P>Before I enter on the account of the ground∣less prosecution which this Pennsylvania state government has compelled me to sustain, it is ne∣cessary to notice some steps that were taken by my enemies previously thereto.</P>
<P>Some time in the month of August last, the Spanish Minister Don Carlos Martinez de'Yru∣jo, applied to the Federal Government to pro∣secute me for certain matters published in my Gazette, against himself and that poor unfortu∣nate and humbled mortal, Charles the fourth, King of Spain. The government consented, and I was accordingly bound over, before the Honourble Judge Peters, to appear in the Fe∣deral district court, which will meet next April.</P>
<P>Of this preparatory step to <HI>a fair and imparti∣al</HI> trial the Don was informed. But, it would seem, the information was far from being satis∣factory to him; for, he delivered in a memori∣al to the Federal Government, requesting (for what reason I leave the reader to determine) that the trial might come on before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, of which court <HI>M'Kean is Chief Justice.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="033523_0021_0FF7D494A531E190"/>Thus foiled in the grand object, a new scru∣tiny was, without much regard to decency, set on foot; new pretended libels were hunted out; and, an application to prosecute me was made to the government of Pennsylvania. It is hardly necessary to say that consent was speedi∣ly obtained. A bill of indictment was prepared by the attorney General of the state, and a war∣rant, of which the following is a copy was issued to sieze me.</P>

<P>For as much as the Chief Justice of OUR Supreme Court is given to understand by the information, testimo∣ny, and complaint of credible persons, that WILLIAM COBBETT of the City of Philadelphia, printer, is the printer and publisher of certain infamous and wicked li∣bels against His Chatholic Majesty the King of Spain, the Chevalier Charles Martinez de Yrujo envoy extraor∣dinary and minister plenipotentiary of His said Catholic Majesty to the United States of America, and of the Spanish nation, contained in public journals, or news-pa∣pers called PORCUPINE'S GAZETTE, numbers 114, 115, 121, 127, 156, 160, 163 and 180, in the said City of Phi∣ladelphia, tending to defame the said, King, envoy and minister, and the subjects of the said King, to <HI>alienate their</HI> AFFECTIONS AND REGARD <HI>from the government and citizens of the United States of America</HI> and of US, to excite them to hatred, hostilities and war against the said United States.</P>

<P>If I did not well know, that all instruments of this kind, coming from under the hand and seal of a <HI>Judge,</HI> are, by privilege immemorial, exempted from the lash of criticism, I should most certainly be tempted to try my hand on the warrant.—For instance: the Commonwealth is called US, and this may be proper enough, as the Commonwealth, in the modern stile, means the <HI>citizens thereof.</HI> But, what shall we make of the passage, where it is said, that I endeavoured to alienate the affections of the Spaniards from the citizens of the United States <HI>and of</HI> US; that is, from the citizens of the United States, <HI>and from the citizens of</HI> US; and this last sentence means, <HI>from the citizens of the citizens of the Commonwealth</HI>! In the name of mercy what is all this! Is the form intended to convey a no∣tion, that the citizens of Pennsylvania have <HI>other citizens</HI> under their controul and government; or that the citizens of the Commonwealth are
<PB N="26" REF="033523_0023_0FF7D491A1B8CC18"/>
<HI>their own citizens,</HI> and that WE govern US?— A projector some few years ago received a <HI>prize medal</HI> from the philosophical society of Philadel∣phia, for having invented an <HI>American language.</HI> I wonder if this warrant be a specimen of it?</P>
<P>But, let <HI>us</HI> return to more solid matter.</P>
<P>The trifling circumstances attending an arrest and giving bail are scarcely worth relating; but, sometimes, trifling circumstances serve to convey a more correct idea of the character of the par∣ties concerned in a transaction, and to guide the reader to a more just appreciation of their mo∣tives, than the longest and most laboured gene∣ral account of their conduct.</P>
<P>The Sheriff (whose civility and candour I have every reason to applaud) came to my house, for <HI>the first time,</HI> at twelve o'clock; and he was ordered to have me before the Judge <HI>at half past one.</HI> Thank God, I am not versed in arrests; but, I believe, this is the first time, that ever a man, prosecuted for a libel, was pinned down to the short space of <HI>an hour and a half</HI> to prepare for going out and to procure himself bail. The English reader (for this pamphlet shall be read in England) will observe, that this government of Pennsylvania, is that which is everlastingly boasting of the <HI>mildness</HI> and <HI>hu∣manity</HI> of its laws.</P>
<P>I was not so destitute of friends as, perhaps, the Judge expected I was. Bail was pro∣cured, and we were before him at the appointed time.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="033523_0024_0FF7D498A2CE7238"/>He asked us to sit down. I seated myself on one side of the fire, and he on the other. After he had talked on for some time to very little pur∣pose (at least as to the effect his talk produced on me), he shewed me certain newspapers, and asked me if <HI>I had printed and published them.</HI> To this I replied, <HI>that the law did not require me to answer any questions in that stage of the busi∣ness, and that, therefore, I should not do it.</HI> At this reply, though a very prudent and a very proper one, "he waxed exceeding wroth." He instantly ordered me to get off my chair and stand up before him, though he himself had in∣vited me to sit down. This species of resent∣ment, so becoming in a <HI>Judge,</HI> excited in my mind no other sentiments than that which I dare say it has already excited in the mind of the reader.</P>
<P>The next document, which follows in due course, is THE BILL OF INDICTMENT; the IGNORAMUS Bill of Indictment.—Go over it with attention, I beseech thee, reader; or else, take my word for it, you will be just as wise when you have done, as you are now. You must have your eyes well about you; keep a sharp look out for parenthesises and quotations; and, above all you must <HI>hold your breath to the bottom of a paragraph</HI>; if you can't do this, you will no more understand it than you would the croaking of a frog or the cakling of a goose.— Therefore, again I say, attention!</P>

<Q>Ever since Spain has been governed by princes of the Bour∣bon family, the Spanish name has been disgraced in peace and in war; every important measure has been directed by the crooked politics of France—This connection, like the abscene ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of old, contaminates whatever it touches.

<P>THIS Bill of Indictment, however insignifi∣cant it may be in itself, has already made con∣siderable noise in the world, and it will yet make a great deal more. Papers of this sort generally travel from the court to the clerk's office; and there they lodge in eternal sleep. But this Bill is certainly destined to another fate. Neptune will lend his waves and Aeolus his winds to con∣duct it over the deep. It will see climes that the inventors of it never saw, nor ever will see. Little did they imagine, that they were becom∣ing <HI>authors,</HI> and authors of such celebrity too, as, if it please God, I will render them.</P>
<P>The identical copy of this precious document of liberty, which I received from the clerk's office, stamped with the arms of poor Pennsyl∣vania, I shall send to London by the next pack∣et, addressed to MR. REEVES'S loyal society of the Crown and Anchor. When they are infest∣ed with the <HI>reformists,</HI> or any other noisy gang
<PB N="32" REF="033523_0029_0FF77217D33680B8"/>
of <HI>liberty men,</HI> they will have nothing to do but show them this Bill, and say:
<Q>Here, you dis∣contented dogs, is this what you are barking after? If it be, go to that <HI>free</HI> country, Ameri∣ca.</Q>
I am much mistaken if the bare sight of it would not make more converts to their cause than all the means, that their talents and their laudable zeal have hitherto invented or employ∣ed. It is a sample of the liberty which the dis∣affected in Britain are sighing after; and they would exclaim with the old miller in the fable, "if such is the <HI>sample,</HI> what must be the <HI>sack</HI>!"</P>
<P>The charges contained in the Bill of Indict∣ment, lie buried in such a multitude of words which mean nothing, or at least nothing to the purpose, that they are very difficult to be under∣stood. Some one says of a man extremely ver∣bose in his conversation, that "his wit is like three grains of wheat in a bushel of chaff;" and exactly the same may with truth be said of the meaning of this Bill. The <HI>three libels,</HI> as they are called, may all be contained in a quarter of a page, whereas the Bill is swelled out to three or four pages. Let us, then, sift out the <HI>three grains of wheat,</HI> leaving the chaff behind.</P>
<P>The best way of doing this, and of enabling the reader to form a correct judgment both as to their import and their tendency, will be to lay before him the three publications (in which they are to be found) entire and undistorted, marking the pretended libellous parts in <HI>it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>licks.</HI></P>

Besides what she paid to purchase a dishonourable peace, Spain has already lost large sums in specie, a considerable part of her navy, and a very valuable island; and if she persist in her present stupid system of obedience, without claiming the second sight of a Scotchman, I will pronounce her ruin inevitable — Nothing is wanted but a conjoint operation between Great Britain and the United States, to open a way to all the riches of Mexico: and however Spain may deceive herself, it is not all the crooked man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vres of French and Ameri∣can Jacobins, who are as much her enemies as ours, that can long prevent it. Events are pointing, with the clearness of a sun-beam, to the absolute, irresista∣ble necessity of such a coalition. The base subsidised agents of France cannot long check the just resentment, or resist the measures of a high spirited and free people, who scorned to receive the law from freemen, and will never sub∣mit to receive it from slaves. The proud spirited of '76, that encountered dan∣gers far more tremendous, than any that now present themselves, will burst not with the greater violence, for being so long restrained, and spreading from north to south will bear down all opposition —The strength of this government is great, in its various resources, as well as in the affection of all its citi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w base profligates excepted; and nothing but the want of an union of coun∣cils, and an excessive love of peace, has hitherto prevented our enemies from feeling it We hold the sate of the French and Spanish West-Indies in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds; and without having recourse to the infernal practice of the French, the arming of slaves against their masters, we are able, with a small naval aid, to revo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ize all the kingdom of Mexico. — But with all this respectability of strength and character, it has been the unhappy fate of this government to submit to violations and indignities, almost without example; and this has been owing as much to the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>meness of its friends, as to the aud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>city of its ene∣mies; for while these have been united and persevereing, as all conspirators are, those have been torpid, and without any union or combination of efforts — <HI>In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he present state of things the independence of the United States is little more

"The prospect," said they,
<Q>that now looks so bright, will soon be darkened by clouds, heavier than any that has yet hung over you. Your government will be torn by civil factions, and you will be tossed to and fro, like a tennis-ball, by the contending na∣tions of Europe. France, which you now hug as an ally and equal, will corrupt your citizens, and soment divisions among them; by which your go∣vernment will be so weakened that it will not dare to oppose her ambitions designs. She can never forget her being expelled from this country with dis∣grace, nor will she fail to improve the first opportunity to recover some part of it.</Q>
—This is almost fulfilled in the present unfortunate state of things, but the case is not without a remedy, if prompt decission and firmness is adopt∣ed, on the part of government and its influential friends. To these the great body of the well-affected citizens look for an example. They feel the wounds of their country, they resent them, and if properly led would speedily avenge them. They fear neither the foreign enemy, nor the dastardly traitors among themselves, but would rejoice in an opportunity of sacrificing to both their much injured and insulted country.—In what consists the principal strength of France. It is in the poison of her principles among the mob, and corruption of her money among rebels and parricides. These have been the base diabolical arts, by which she has done as much as by her arms; and miserable has been the fate of all those countries, where they have been not seasonably and vigor∣ously opposed. If after so many examples to teach us, we continue to fold our arms, and wrap ourselves up in an imagined security, our turn will come next: and we shall add one more to the gloomy catalogue of the tributatries of France.— Therefore let the friends of their country and its government asso∣ciate at this critical juncture, to support the constituted authorities, and to op∣pose their enemies by spirited and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed efforts While traitors and foreign emissaries are daily insulting the chief magistrate by virulent and inflamatory publications; when the ministers of France and Spain, forgetting common de∣cency, obt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ude their appeals on the people, in order to mislead the ignorant; it is the duty of all those who condemn such criminal conduct to declare their reso∣lution to oppose it.</P>

<P>These, reader, are the three publications, for which, under the <HI>free</HI> and <HI>equal</HI> government of Pennsylvania. I have been harrassed with a <HI>cri∣minal</HI> prosecution; for which (besides the ex∣pence inseperable from all law concerns) I have been subjected to the infamy of an arrest, and have been dragged from my home, to the inju∣ry of my affairs and the great alarm of my wife and family.</P>
<P>I would not insult the respectable gentlemen, who composed the majority of the Grand Jury,
<PB N="37" REF="033523_0034_0FF77224F6DBEA30"/>
or the good sense of the reader, by any attempt of mine to prove that nothing contained in these publications is of a libellous nature. If these are libels, there is no book sacred or profane, which might not be construed into a libel. Every history contains libel upon libel against kings, queens and ministers. If these are libels, who is safe? In such a state of things a man may draw down <HI>the punishment of a murderer</HI> on himself while he is saying his prayers or singing of psalms.</P>
<P>Of the three publications, the two first only <HI>originated</HI> in my Gazette: the other was taken from the <HI>Gazette of the United States,</HI> published by Mr. Fenno. Of this latter circumstance I shall speak more fully, when I come to the Chief Judge's charge.</P>
<P>The two publications, which made their first appearance through my means, I have not the honour to be the writer of. They were both written by gentlemen of this city; <HI>native</HI> Ame∣ricans, men who were determined <HI>whigs</HI> during the war for independence, republicans in prin∣ciple, and firmly attached to the present go∣vernment.</P>
<P>In the first of these two publications, though there is certainly nothing libellous, I am ready to confess there is a great deal of <HI>warmth;</HI> and if the admission of an essay extraordinarily warm, abounding in strong expressions of resentment and indignation, were ever justifiable, they most assuredly were on such an occasion. The commu∣nication
<PB N="38" REF="033523_0035_0FF772278553D0B8"/>
of the OLD SOLDIER was sent me at a mo∣ment, when the city of Philadelphia, just quiet∣ed after the <HI>appeal</HI> of the French Minister Adet,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Censor for November, 1796</NOTE> rang with the daring, the degrading, the con∣temptuous insult, which the Spaniard Yrujo had offered to the government of America and to every individual living under it.</P>
<P>He had published a most audacious letter to Mr. Pickering, the Secretary of State, contain∣ing a summary of all that is insolent. This let∣ter had been handed and hawked about the city; and had, by his secretary, been sent to every public print for insertion. It was gone forth to the universe; and, that it tended to de∣grade and defame America, we need no other proof than the following paragraph from the London Gazette of the 14th of September.—
<Q>The Americans are, according to our last ad∣vices from New-York, paying dear for their <HI>independence.</HI> The French take all their ves∣sels, block up their very rivers, punish their seamen like malefactors, and actually make them pay for the shot they fire at them; while the Spanish Minister, with impunity, insults and braves their poor enfeebled government. He has written to Timothy Pickering, Esq. their first Secretary of State (see our Gazette of yesterday) in a language that Buonaparte would not venture to assume to his Cisalpinc convention, or citizen Noel to the fallen and degraded Dutch: and what very much aggra∣vates the insult, he has, without, permission from the President of the general Congress,
<PB N="39" REF="033523_0036_0FF77229074FBFF8"/>
communicated this letter to the people, as a sort of manifesto, or appeal, to them from their government. Nothing of this kind, we believe, ever before passed <HI>unresented,</HI> except in a conquered or invaded country; and we cannot help lamenting, that so very little spi∣rit should be found in any people, but particu∣larly in a people, who boast their origin from Britons.</Q></P>
<P>This paragraph, or at least the substance of it, I have seen in three London papers and in one Dublin paper; so that, it may be fairly con∣cluded, its currency is by this time general, not only in the British dominions, but all over Eu∣rope.—And, I pray, was no one to attempt to wipe away the stigma? Though the public pa∣pers had been made subservient to the spreading of this deep shame and disgrace abroad, was no printer to admit any thing that served to mark the strong indignation it inspired at home? Was the press to be free for the Spaniard alone? Was he to be allowed to taunt and threaten and despise; and were the poor Americans to sew up their lips, or only mutter their impotent an∣ger in secret? If this be so; if no man, by as∣suming a bold, an indignant, and retaliating tone, was to make an effort to rescue his coun∣try and himself from dishonour, without being harrassed with a prosecution, without hazarding <HI>the punishment of a murderer,</HI> ours is a fallen state indeed! If this be liberty and independence, or whatever else it may be called, God grant me the enjoyment of its opposite. If this be free∣dom, may I be a bondsman, yea a very slave, to the end of my days.</P>
<Q><PB N="40" REF="033523_0037_0FF7722A8A7AA9B8"/>
<L>If such be justice, such the laws,</L>

<L>I gladly join the <HI>tyrant's</HI> cause,</L>
<L>And seek for refuge in my <HI>chains.</HI></L></Q>
<P>I shall now come to Judge M'Kean's Charge to the Grand Jury; and shall, without going out of court, take upon me to decide on its merits.</P>
<P>It was a charming thing this, for me to get hold of. I had long wished to possess some such proof, some such convincing proof, of the <HI>superiority</HI> of the American liberty of the press over that enjoyed in the "<HI>Insular Bastile,</HI>" Great Britain; and it is to the desire that I have of giving it a portable and durable situation, and to that alone, that this pamphlet is to be attribu∣ted: for which kind intention I humbly hope his <HI>Honour</HI> will feel inclined to pardon my past misdoings. His pretty <HI>works</HI> will now be read with admiration, in countries where, I am sure, had it not been for me, his name would never have once been articulated.</P>
<P>When this Charge, garnished with my sim∣ple and good-natured comments, comes to be served up in Britain, it will be a dish for a king. The royalists will lick their lips, and the republi∣cans will cry, God bless us! The emigration for <HI>li∣berty's sake</HI> will cease, and we shall have nothing but the pure unadulterated dregs of Newgate and the Fleet; the candidates for Tyburn and Bo∣tany Bay. Blessed cargo! All <HI>patriots</HI> to the back-bone: true philanthropists and universal citizens; fit for any place but England in this world, and for heaven in the next.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="033523_0038_0FF77236317F3FD8"/>The famous charge, which is to produce these excellent effects, was delivered to the Grand Ju∣ry at the Court of Oyer and Terminer, above∣mentioned in the Bill of Indictment. I shall not fill up my pages in copying the former part of it, which the reader will, I am persuaded, readily excuse when he has read the latter. Like two uncouth boorish visitants, the presence of the one renders all apology unnecessary for the absence of the other.</P>
<P>The Judge began, as, I believe, is usual, with a definition of the several crimes, which general∣ly fall under the cognizance of such a court: as, treason, sodomy, rape, forgery, murder, &amp;c. &amp;c. But these his <HI>Honour</HI> touched slightly upon. He brushed them over as light and trifling of∣fences; or rather he blew them aside as the chaff of the criminal code, in order to come at the more solid and substantial sin of LIBELLING.</P>
<P>The weight, or rather the measure, that his Honour gave to this crime above all others, on this particular occasion, I shall prove—not by ratiocination, but by arithmetic; by measure∣ment with the aid of a Carpenter's two-foot rule; as thus:</P>
<P>The Charge contains separate definitions of 32 crimes, the whole of which, in the columns of the Gazette, occupy 5 F. 8 Inches, running measure; of which that of LIBELLING alone oc∣cupies 3 F. 1 In. 6 P. On these dimensions I state the following</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="033523_0039_0FF77237B316FEA8"/>
<LABEL>PROBLEM.</LABEL>
If 32 Crimes occupy 5 F. 8 In. and 1 crime occupies 3 F. 1 In. 6 P. of how much greater magnitude ought this 1 crime to be than any 1 of the remaining 31.</P>
<P><LABEL>SOLUTION—18 <HI>Times.</HI></LABEL>
Thus, then, if we are to judge from the di∣mensions of the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania's charge, <HI>Libelling</HI> is eighteen times worse, more dangerous and more heinous, than robbery, forgery, treason, sodomy, or murder!</P>
<P>The fact is, the Charge seemed studied to ex∣cite a horror of no crime but that of libelling; the court seemed met for the punishment of no∣thing else, and I seemed to be the sole object of that punishment. Of this the reader will be con∣vinced by a perusal of the Charge itself; and <HI>the cause</HI> he will find explained in the subsequent remarks.</P>
<P><LABEL>CHARGE.</LABEL> 
The Chief Judge (M'KEAN), after having, as was before observed, just touched on the nature and punishment of other crimes, proceeds, with respect to LIBELS, thus:</P>
<Q><P>Before I conclude, <HI>I am sorry</HI> to have occasion to mention, that there is ano∣ther crime, that peculiarly concerns the judges of the supreme come to endea∣vour to correct, it is that of LIBELLING. I will describe it at large.</P>
<P>Libels or libelli famosi, taken in the most extensive sense, signify any writings, pictures, or the like, of an <HI>immoral</HI> or illegal tendency; but in the sense we are now to consider them, are malicious defamations of any person, and especially of a magistrate, made public either by writing, printing, signs or pictures, in order to provoke him to wrath, or to expose him to public hatred, contempt or ridicule.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="033523_0040_0FF7723ACB2EE270"/>The direct tendency of these libels is the breach of the public peace, by stirring up the objects of them, their families and friends to acts of revenge, and perhaps of bloodshed; which it would be impossible to restrain by the se∣verest laws, were there no redress from public justice for injuries of this kind, which, of all others, are most sensibly felt; and which, being entered upon with coolness and deliberation receive a greater aggravation than any other scandal or defamation, continue longer, and are propagated wider and farther. <HI>And where libels are printed against persons employed in a public capacity, they receive an aggravation, as they tend to scandalize the government,</HI> by reflecting on those who are entrusted with the administration of public affairs, and thereby not only endanger the public peace, as all others do, by stirring up the parties immediately concerned to acts of revenge, but have also a direct tendency to breed in the people a dislike of their governors, and incline them to faction and sedition.</P>
<P>Not only charges of a heinous nature, and which reflect a moral turpitude on the party, are libellous, but also such as set him in <HI>a scurrilous ignominious light:</HI> For every person <HI>desires to appear agreeable in life,</HI> and must be highly provoked by such ridiculous representations of him, as tend to lessen him in the esteem of the world, and take away his reputation, which to some men is more dear than life itself, for these equally create ill-blood, and provoke the parties to acts of revenge, and breaches of the peace.</P>
<P>A defamatory writing expressing <HI>only one or two letters of a name,</HI> or using <HI>such descriptions and circumstances, feigned names</HI> or <HI>circumstances,</HI> in such a manner, that <HI>from what goes before,</HI> and <HI>follows after,</HI> it must needs be <HI>under∣stood</HI> to signify such a person in the plain, obvious and natural <HI>construction</HI> of the whole, is as properly a libel, as if it had expressed the whole name at large: for it brings the utmost contempt upon the law, to suffer it's justice to be eluded by such trifling evasions; and it is a ridiculous absurdity to say, that a writing, which is understood by every the meanest capacity, cannot possibly be under∣stood by the courts and juries.</P>
<P>It is equally ridiculous and absurd to suppose that if a man speaks slanderous or defamatory words of another, he may be such, and ample damages recovered for the injury, but if the same words are put in writing or printed, no punishment can be inflicted. Such a doctrine may gratify the wishes of envious and <HI>mali∣cious cowards and assassins,</HI> but must be detested by all sensible and good men.</P>
<P>These offences are punishable either by indictment, information or civil ac∣tion: But there are some instances where they can be punished by a criminal prosecution only; as where the United States in congress assembled, the legisla∣ture, judges of the supreme court, or civil magistrates in general are charged with corruption, moral turpitude, base partiality, and the like, when no one in particular is named.</P>
<P>By the law of the twelve tables at Rome, libels which affected the reputation of another, were made capital offences: But before the reign of Augustus, the punishment became corporeal only. Order the emperor <HI>Valentinian, it was again made capital,</HI> not only to wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but to publish, or even <HI>to omit destroying them.</HI> But by the laws of Pennsylvania, the authors, printers, and publishers of a libel are punishable <HI>by fine,</HI> and also a limited <HI>imprisonment at hard labour,</HI> and <HI>solitary confinement in goal,</HI> or <HI>imprisonment only,</HI> or <HI>one of them,</HI> as to the court in discretion shall seem proper, according to the heinousness of the crime, and the quality and circumstances of the offender.</P>
<P>Any libeller, or person even speaking words of contempt against an inferior magistrate, as a justice of the peace or mayor personally, though he be not then in the actual execution of his office, or of an inferior officer of justice, as a con∣stable and such like, being in the actual execution of his office, may be bound to his good behaviour by a single justice of the peace.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="033523_0041_0FF7723C503A30A8"/>By this law and these punishments, the liberty of the press (<HI>a phrase much used but little understood</HI>) is by no means infringed or violated. The liberty of the press is indeed essential to the nature of a free state; but this consists in laying <HI>no previous restraints</HI> upon publications, and not in freedom from cen∣sure for criminal matter, when published Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before the public; to forbid this, is to destroy the freedom of the press; but if he publishes what is improper, mischievous or illegal, he must take the consequences of his temerity. To punish dangerous or offensive writings which, when published, shall on a fair and impartial trial, be adjudged of a pernicious tendency, is necessary for the preservation of peace and good order, of government and religion; the only solid foundation of civil liberty. Thus the will of individuals is still left free, the abuse only of that free-will is the object of legal punishment. Our presses in Pennsylvania are thus free. The common law, with respect to this, <HI>is confirmed and established by the constitution itself.</HI> By the 7th sect. of the declaration of the principles of a free government, &amp;c. it is ascertained, "that the printing-presses shall be free to every person, who undertakes to examine the proceedings of the legisla∣ture, or any part of government." Men, therefore, have only to take care in their publications, that they are decent, candid and true; that they are for the purpose of reformation, and not of defamation; and that they have an eye sole∣ly to the public good. Publications of this kind are not only lawful but lauda∣ble. But if they are made to gratify envy or malice, and contain personal in∣vectives, low scurrility, or slanderous charges; they can answer no good pur∣poses for the community, but on the contrary, must destroy the very ends of so∣ciety —Were these to escape with impunity, youth would not be safe in it's in∣nocence, nor venerable old age in it's wisdom, gravity, and virtue; dignity and station would become a reproach; and the fairest and best characters, that this or any other country ever produced, would be vilified and blasted, if not ruined.</P>
<P>If any person, whether in a public or private station, does injury to an indi∣vidual, or to the society, ample redress can be had by having <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cse to the laws,</HI> and the proper tribunals, where the parties can be heard personally, or by coun∣sel, the truth can be fairly investigated, and justice fully obtained: so that there can be no necessity nor reason for accusing any one of <HI>public</HI> or private w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ongs <HI>in pamphlets or newspapers,</HI> or of appeals to the people, under <HI>feigned names,</HI> or by <HI>anonymous scribblers.</HI></P>
<P>Every one who has in him the sentiments of either a Christian or a gen∣tleman, cannot but be highly offended at the cave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed scu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tility that has ra∣ged in pamphlets and news-papers, printed in Philadelphia for several years past, insomuch that libelling has become a kind or national crime, and dis∣tinguishes us not only from all the states <HI>around us,</HI> but from the whole civili∣zed world. Our sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e has been nothing but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibeldry and billingsgate: the contest has been who could call names in the greatest variety of phrases; who could mangle the greatest number of characters; or who could excel in the magnitude or virulence of their lies. Hence the honour of families has been stained; the highest posts rendered cheap and vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the sight of the people, and the greatest services and virtue blasted This evil, so scandalous to ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> government and detestable in the eyes of all good men, calls aloud for redress. To censure the licenciousness is to maintain the liberty of the press.</P>
<P>At a time when misunderstandings prevail between the Republics of the United States and France, and when our general government have appointed public ministers to endeavour their removal and restore the former harmony some of the journals or news-papers in the city of Philadelphia have seemed with the most irritating in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, couched in the most vulgar and opprobri∣ous language, not only against the French nation and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, but the very met in power with whom the ministers of our country are sent to negociate.
<PB N="45" REF="033523_0042_0FF7723F1BE15440"/>
These publications have an evident tendency not only to frustrate a recon∣ciliation, but to create a rupture and provoke a war <HI>between the sister Repub∣lics,</HI> and seem calculated to vilify, nay, to subvert all <HI>Republican</HI> governments whatsoever.</P>
<P><HI>Impressed with the duties of my station,</HI> I have used some endeavours for checking these evils, by binding over the editor and printer <HI>of one of them,</HI> licentious and virulent <HI>beyond all former example,</HI> to his good behaviour; but he still perseveres in his nefarious publications; he has ransacked our language for terms of reproach and insult, and for the basest accusations against every ruler and <HI>distinguished</HI> character <HI>in France and Spain,</HI> with whom we chance to have any intercourse, which it is s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rce in nature to forgive; in brief, he braves his recognizance and the laws. It is now with you, gentlemen of the grand jury, to animadvert on his conduct; without <HI>your aid</HI> it cannot be cor∣rected. The government that will not discountenance, may <HI>be thought to adopt it,</HI> and be deemed <HI>justly chargeable with all the consequence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI></P>
<P>Every nation ought to avoid giving any real offence to another. Some me∣dals and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll jests are mentioned and represented as a ground of quarrel be∣tween the English and Dutch in 1672, and likewise caused Lewis the 14th to make an expedition into the United Provinces of the Netherlands in the same year, and nearly ruined that Commonwealth.</P>
<P>We are sorry to find that our endeavours in this way have not been attended with all the good effects that were expected from them; however we are de∣termined to pursue the prevailing vice of the times with zeal and indignation, that crimes may no longer appear less odious for being fashionable, nor the more secure from punishment for being popular.</P>
<P>The criminal law of this state is so <HI>pregnant with justice,</HI> so agreeable to rea∣son, so full of equity and clemency, that even those who suffer, by it cannot charge it with rigor. It is so adapted to the common good as to suffer no folly to go unpunished, which that requires to be restrained; and yet so tender of the infirmities of human nature, and of the wives and children of even the greatest offenders, as to refuse no indulgence which the safety of the public will permit. It gives the rulers no power but of doing good, and deprives the people of no liberty out of doing evil. We are now (thank God) in the peaceable and full enjoyment of our laws, of the free administration of justice, and in complete possession of religious, civil and political liberty. May the Divine Governor of the world continue these blessings to us, and impress it as a duty which we owe to ourselves who enjoy them; to those virtuous men, who, under God, have been chiefly instrumental in procuring them; and to our posterity who will claim at our hands this noblest inheritance, to maintain and defend them at every hazard of life and fortune.</P>
<P>You may now, gentlemen, retire to your room. Inquire with zeal, hear with attention, deliberate with coolness, judge with <HI>impartiality,</HI> and decide with fortitude And may God over-rule and direct all your proceedings to the furtherance of justice and the happpiness of the people.</P></Q>
<P>I have ever entertained the notion of an im∣mediate superintending Providence, and I most sincerely believe, that God did over-rule and di∣rect all the proceedings of this Grand Jury; for they did judge with <HI>impartiality,</HI> and decide with <HI>fortitude,</HI> though their judgement and decision were not <HI>quite</HI> consonant to the wishes of the

Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, as appeared not only from his Charge, but also from what he hinted repecting the Jury, the day after the Bill was returned.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The day after the Bill was returned IGNORAMUS, the Chief Justice, on the trial of Mr Humphreys for beating Bache, told the prisoner, that, if he had thought himself agrieved by the <HI>press,</HI> he should have appealed to the law; and added; "you may say, indeed, that GAND JURIES will not do <HI>their duty:</HI> we have had a <HI>recent instance of that.</HI>"—On this reflection on the Grand Jury, it is not my duty to comment. But, had I been one of the gentlemen who composed it, I think I should have made an attempt, at least, to defo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d my conduct and character.</NOTE></P>
<P>So pointed, so personal a charge, I am bold to say, was never before delivered from the Bench in any country, that has the least pre∣tensions to civil liberty. If it be foreseen, that a particular case, rather novel, is to come before a Grand Jury, it is the custom for Judges, as it certainly is their duty, to explain its nature, its tendency, and the law respecting it fully and minutely; but never, till the 27th day of last No∣vember, did a Judge, presiding to administer justice according to the mild and impartial pre∣cepts of the Common Law of England, so far forget the genuine spirit of that law as to point directly at a single offender, and to employ all the persuasion in his power to bring down chas∣tisement on his head.</P>
<P>The Charge contains every thing calculated to awaken the apprehensions of the Grand Jury as to the effects of my conduct, and to prepos∣sess their minds against my person. In every thing but elegance and animation, it was more like the zealous and impassioned pleadings of an advocate, than the calm, dignified, and im∣partial
<PB N="47" REF="033523_0044_0FF7724426801058"/>
accents that ever should breathe in the language from the Bench.</P>
<P>And, what was there, I pray, either in my character, in the particular case before the Grand Jury, or in the general tenor of my pub∣lications, to warrant this odious departure from the excellent rules, which had their origin in de∣cency and candour, and which have been ren∣dered sacred by the practice of our fore-fathers? A stranger, had there been one in court, would naturally have concluded me to be a notorious defamer of innocence, a seditious and turbulent troubler of the government, a sworn enemy of morality and religion; in three words, a profli∣gate, a rebel, and a blasphemer.</P>
<P>It hardly ever becomes a man to say much of his private character and concerns; but, on this occasion, I trust I shall be indulged for a mo∣ment. I will say, and I will make that saying good against whoever shall oppose it, that I have never attacked any one, whose private charac∣ter is not, in every light which it can possibly be viewed, as far beneath mine as infamy is be∣neath honour.—Nay; I defy the city of Phila∣delphia, populous as it is, and respectable as are its inhabitants in general, to produce me a sin∣gle man, who is more sober, industrious or ho∣nest; who is a kinder husband, a tenderer father, a better master, a sounder friend, or (though last not least) a more zealous and faithful subject.</P>
<P>Most certainly it is unseemly in any one to say thus much of himself, unless compelledt it by some public outrage on his character; but,
<PB N="48" REF="033523_0045_0FF7715F635D0250"/>
when the accusation is thus made notorious, so ought the defence. And I do again and again repeat, that I fear not a comparison between my character and that of any man in the city: no, not even with that of the very Judge, who held me up as the worst of miscreants. His Honour is welcome, if he please, to carry this comparison into <HI>all</HI> the actions of our lives, public and <HI>do∣mestic,</HI> and to extend it beyond ourselves to <HI>every branch of our families.</HI></P>
<P>As to my writings; I never did slander any one, if the promulgation of useful truths be not slander. Innocence and virtue I have often en∣deavoured to defend, but I never defamed ei∣ther. I have, indeed, stripped the close-drawn veil off hypocricy; I have ridiculed the follies and lashed the vices of thousands, and have done it sometimes, perhaps, with a rude and vio∣lent hand. But, these are not the days for gen∣tleness and mercy. Such as is the temper of the foe, such must be that of his opponent. See∣ing myself published for a rogue <HI>and my wife for a whore;</HI> being presecuted with such infamous, such base and hellish calumny in the <HI>philanthro∣pic</HI> city of Philadelphia, merely for asserting <HI>the truth</HI> respecting others, was not calculated, I as∣sure you, to sweeten my temper and turn my ink into honey-dew.</P>
<P>My attachment to order and good government nothing but the impudence of Jacobinism could deny. The object, not only of all my own pub∣lications, but also of all those which I have intro∣duced or encouraged, from the first moment that I appeared on the public seene to the pre∣sent
<PB N="49" REF="033523_0046_0FF7724E819551B8"/>
day, has been, to lend some aid in stemming the torrent of anarchy and confusion. To un∣deceive the misguided, by tearing the mask from the artful and ferocious villains, who, owing to the infatuation of the poor and the supineness of the rich, have made such a fearful progress in the destruction of all that is amiable and good and sacred among men. To the government of this country, in particular, it has been my con∣stant study to yield all the support in my power. When either that government, or the worthy men who administer it, have been traduced and vilified, I have stood forward in their defence; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that too, in times when even its friends were some of them locked up in silence, and others giving way to the audacious violence of its foes.—Not that I am so foolishly vain as to attribute to my illiterate pen a thousandth part of the merit that my friends are inclined to al∣low it. As I wrote the other day to a gentle∣man who had paid me some compliments on this score,
<Q>I should never look at my family with a dry eye, if I did not hope to outlive my works.</Q>
They are mere transitory beings, to which the revolutionary storm has given life, and which with that storm will expire.—But, what I contend for, and what nobody can deny, I have done all that laid in my power: all I was able by any means to accomplish, in order to coun∣teract the nefarious efforts of the enemies of the American government and nation.</P>
<P>With respect to religion, though Mr. M'Kean was pleased to number it among the things that were in danger from the licentiousness of the press, and, of course, from poor ME, I think it
<PB N="50" REF="033523_0047_0FF77250044AA5E8"/>
would puzzel the devil himself to produce, from my writings, a single passage, which could, by all the powers of perversion, be twisted into an attack on it. But, it would, on the contrary, be extremely easy to prove, that I have, at all times when an opportunity offered, repelled the attacks of its enemies, the abominable battalions of Deists and Atheists, with all my heart, with all my mind, with all my soul, and with all my strength. The bitterest drop in my pen has ever been bestowed on them; because, of all the foes of the human race, I look upon them, after the Devil, as being the greatest and most dreadful. Not a sacrilegious plunderer, from Henry VIII to Condorcet, and from Condorcet to the impi∣ous Sans-Culottes of Virginia, has escaped my censure. All those who have attempted to de∣grade religion, whether by open insults and cru∣elties to the Clergy, by blasphemous publica∣tions, or by the more dangerous poison of the malignant modern phisophy, I have ranked amongst the most infamous of mankind, and have treated them accordingly.</P>
<P>After this summary defence of my character and writings, the necessity of which I sincerely regret, justice demands that I should enter into an exposition of the unparalleled partiality that has been exercised towards me: and when I have done that, I pledge myself to prove, in contradiction to all the boastings which we have heard, that the press is free-er in Great Britain than in America.</P>
<P>To read the Chief Judge's famous Charge, one would inevitably be led to imagine, that no
<PB N="51" REF="033523_0048_0FF77251B6A17940"/>
person in this country, except PETER PORCU∣PINE, ever attempted to exercise the Liberty of the press, or even that pitiful portion of it which his Honour had the mercy to leave in our hands. All the other printers, one would think, had been poor passive devils, and that their sheets had contained nought but vapid songs of liberty, lying eulogies on departed rascallity, and ful∣some flattery of villains in power. But, to do justice to my brother printers, to myself, and to Judge M'Kean, I am compelled to prove that this was not the case.</P>
<P>There are certain news-printers in this coun∣try, who may be counted as a sort of blanks: creatures that have nothing of humanity about them but the mere exterior form and motion, and that are, in every other respect, as perfect∣ly logs as if they had been cut out of a piece of timber. I will not degrade myself by a compa∣rison between my conduct and that of these dull, senseless, inanimate beings. Let me have the same privileges as other living active creatures, and I am content.</P>
<P>The reader has seen all that could be conju∣red up against me in the Bill of Indictment, which he may safely set down among the most virulent of my publications; for lawyers and judges know very well how to single the tares from the wheat. But, I am willing to allow him a scrutiny into every sentence I have writ∣ten or published, to which the Chief Judge's Charge can possibly be made to apply, and then I will leave him to compare my "nefarious publications" with the
<Q>decent, candid, <HI>and</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="033523_0049_0FF7725706303698"/>
true</Q>
ones, which I am now about to produce from the presses that have, and still do, espouse the cause of the enemies of this country.</P>
<P>As libels against <HI>religion</HI> are certainly more heinous in their nature, as well as more destruc∣tive in their consequences, than any that can be published against men, however estimable their characters or exalted their rank, I shall first take notice of a publication or two of this sort, which have escaped the notice of the <HI>vigilent</HI> Chief Justice of Pennsylvania: and this, I think, seems the more necessary, as the Judge included <HI>reli∣gion</HI> among the objects endangered by the licen∣tiousness of the press.</P>
<P>In the Summer of 1796, a work was publish∣ed by one STEPHENS (an Irish Patriot, who has since spunged his creditors), entitled: "<HI>Chris∣tianity contrasted with Deism</HI>:" And, by a mas∣ter-piece of baseness, before unheard of among the most infamous of scribblers, my assumed name, PETER PORCUPINE, was inserted in the title page, in order to give currency to the per∣nicious production.</P>
<P>This pamphlet abounded with the most daring impiety; and, though I will not take upon me to say that the Chief Justice ever <HI>saw</HI> it, he must have heard of its existence; for it was not only advertised for sale but there were also a consider∣able number of paragraphs respecting it, both in BACHE's and MR. FENNO's paper.</P>
<P>As to the AGE OF REASON, its publication, by BACHE and others, is too notorious a fact to
<PB N="53" REF="033523_0050_0FF77160E78854B0"/>
be for a moment dwelt upon. This blasphe∣mous work has been spread all over the state, and through this city in particular.</P>
<P>BACHE has, for years past, and does now, publish and sell, what is called the
<Q>Republican Calendar;</Q>
in which the <HI>Christian Aera</HI> is sup∣planted by that of the degrading Atheistical Decadery of France.</P>
<P>All these publications, and many more that might be mentioned, have been, and yet are, pub∣lished in Pennsylvania. Their evident and in∣evitable tendency, is, to corrupt the young, mislead the ignorant, abash the timid, degrade the priest-hood, and, finally, to subvert and de∣stroy, root and branch, the Christian Religion and all its inestimable blessings.</P>
<P>I have the same opinion of the Judge's law knowledge that most people have; but he must certainly know, that <HI>Christianity</HI> is part of <HI>the law of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd</HI>; that to deride and blaspheme it is punishable by the common law; and that it is the duty of all magistrates, more particularly Judges, to make the law, in this respect known, and to see it executed.</P>
<P>Yet, in the state of Pennsylvania, under so watchful a Chief Justice, this salutary law, in∣tended to preserve from indignity the religion of our forefathers; to enforce a respect for the laws of God, and to promote our eternal salva∣tion, has been suffered to sleep in oblivion; while the sanguinary <HI>Twelve Tables of Rome</HI> have been resorted to, in order to enhance the
<PB N="54" REF="033523_0051_0FF771626A2CD060"/>
magnitude of <HI>the crime of satirizing the Spanish king and his minister</HI>!—Gracious God! can the descendants of Britons ever approve of this violence on <HI>the common law of England</HI>?</P>
<P>The Judge tells us that, with respect to libels, the <HI>common law</HI> is <HI>confirmed</HI> by the <HI>constitution of Pennsylvania;</HI> and every one knows, that the common law of America is neither more nor less than the common law of England.—Now, it is well known, that the publisher of Paine's Age of Reason has been prosecuted in England; that LORD KENYON termed it a
<Q>nefarious publication, intended for the most malignant purposes;</Q>
and that the jury instantly found the defendant GUILTY.—But England is, in this respect, no more fit to be compared with America than LORD KENYON is to be compar∣ed with <HI>Judge</HI> M'KEAN.</P>
<P>I have been told, indeed, that the article of the constitution, which provides for an entire freedom as to religious worship and opinions, forbids any restraint on the press where subjects of this sort are agitated. If this be true, and if M'KEAN's doctrine of libels be also true, all that the American press has gained by the "Glorious Revolution," is, the horrid liberty of blaspheming the Almighty!</P>
<P>Quitting libels against <HI>religion,</HI> let us come to those of a less horrid, though not less odious nature.</P>
<P>The Chief Justice tells us, that
<Q>the <HI>honour of families</HI> has been <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained,</HI> and the greatest
<PB N="55" REF="033523_0052_0FF77178EA877B50"/>
<HI>services</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI> blasted;</Q>
and he before told us, that this evil it was <HI>peculiarly the duty</HI> of the Supreme Court to repress.</P>
<P>I have before observed, and I repeat it again and again, that <HI>innocence</HI> or <HI>virtue</HI> was never at∣tacked by me; and hence it is impossible that I can ever have brought a <HI>stain</HI> on a family. Whether others have done this in Philadelphia, I leave the reader to judge from the following passages of a pamphlet, published here about two years and a half ago.</P>
<P>The subject of the author's censure, is a de∣bate in Congress. After calling one member an <HI>Ass</HI> and another a <HI>Snap-Turtle,</HI> he comes to a Gentleman of New-Jersey, who now fills an office of great trust under the Federal Government, of whom and of whose family he speaks thus:
<Q>Not that I would declaim against Congress wages, for I think they ought to have at least ten dollars a day; otherwise an ho∣nourable member from Jersey will not be able to keep Mrs. B . . . . . . . in town during the next session.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"See his speech in the House of Representatives."</NOTE>—Ten dollars, I think, will de∣fray all expences—The honourable represen∣tatives may then play cards and dice, and bil∣liards, and do many other things—and Mrs. B . . . . . . . may afford to <HI>knock off a few bottles of Madeira</HI> with some of her soft <HI>rosy-nosed visitors,</HI> without sinking her honourable spouse <HI>forty shillings below par.</HI></Q></P>
<P>From members of Congress and their wives, the author comes to the Clergy and theirs. Few
<PB N="56" REF="033523_0053_0FF77246E66F3FA8"/>
people have forgotten, that, in 1795, a Sermon on National Gratitude was preached in this city, by a leraned Divine, then at the head of Princeton College. In the course of this much admired sermon, the preacher took occasi∣on to censure the <HI>Age of Reason</HI>; and this it was that brought on him, from our <HI>decent</HI> writer, the following attack:
<Q>Notwithstanding his conster∣nation, he does not forget to bullyrag Tom Paine. Forty two miles did he trudge through thick and thin, Jonah like, to save this our Nineveh by reading a sermon, and may hea∣ven reward his labours! May the fountains of Helicon gush from his brains;—And may all the curbers of the factious, sip nocturnal inspi∣ration from the lips of the muse of Morven, at the limped streams of Stony-brook, nor <HI>be pestered with a d....d wife</HI>;—May they ne∣ver be dragged head-foremost down the steps of Nassau-Hall, <HI>nor be pelted with brick bats and potatoes.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Is this "<HI>decent, candid,</HI> and <HI>true</HI>"? And, if it be not, how came it to
<Q>escape with impuni∣ty?</Q>
How came it not to attract the attention of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, whose
<Q>peculiar duty it is to repress and correct such excesses?</Q>
—The book was published in all the news-papers; it was sold by all the booksel∣lers <HI>except me</HI>; it was even hawked about the streets, and was the subject of universal censure and abhorrence; and yet the Supreme Court never did censure it; nor did the Chief Justice ever feel himself
<Q>impressed with the duties of his station</Q>
to <HI>bind the author or publisher over</HI>!</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="033523_0054_0FF7717A6ED17D28"/>The author was known to a <HI>certain Secretary</HI>; was even his intimate acquaintance and compa∣nion; and his pamphlet abounds with invec∣tives <HI>against Great Britain,</HI> and high sounding <HI>compliments to France.</HI> His politics, I suppose, he had the prudence to intend as a sort of atone∣ment for his offences.</P>
<P>From the <HI>staining of families</HI> let us turn to the attacks of men in their public capacities.</P>
<P>The Chief Justice tells us, that, when defa∣matory writings are published
<Q>against persons in a <HI>public capacity,</HI> they receive an <HI>aggrava∣tion,</HI> as they tend to scandalzie the govern∣ment, &amp;c. &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>This doctrine, by-the-bye, I believe few men, except those in a public capacity will relish. It is exactly contrary to the spirit, as well as the letter, of the little pamphlet, entitled, "The Constitution of Pennsylvania."—In that inesti∣mable performance, there is one Chapter con∣taining a list of what are there called "the es∣sential principles of liberty," which are positive∣ly declared to be excepted out of the general powers of government, and fixed on for ever to remain inviolate.—Among the precious things thus carefully preserved, is, <HI>the liberty of the press</HI>; and it is said, that no law shall be made to restrain any person,
<Q>who undertakes to ex∣amine the proceedings of the legislature <HI>or any branch of government.</HI></Q>
And again it says, that,
<Q>in prosecutions for the publication
<PB N="58" REF="033523_0055_0FF771804D34F758"/>
of any papers, investigating the official con∣duct of officers, or <HI>men in a public capacity,</HI> the truth thereof may be given in evidence.</Q></P>
<P>Thus, you see, this pamphlet of Pennsylvania holds out to the world, that men in a public ca∣pacity are more open to the censure of the press than the sovereign citizens are, which is, indeed, no more than reasonable; but this Judge, this <HI>learned</HI> expositor of the law and constitution, tells us, that censorious writings receive an <HI>ag∣gravation,</HI> when written against persons in a <HI>public capacity</HI>!</P>
<P>However, be it so. Let us prefer the Judge's assertion to the declaration of the sovereign people of Pennsylvania. Let us, for a moment, look upon their constitution as merely intended to amuse them and the world; and then let us see what this State Government, and this same Judge, have permitted to pass unreproved and unnoticed, in writers inimical to the Federal Government, and notoriously in the pay of France.</P>
<P>I could here produce volumes of the most attrocious calumny against the Federal Govern∣ment and its officers individually; but, besides my want of room, I am prevented by the noto∣riety of the fact. Every one in America knows what I have here generally stated, to be true; and it is therefore necessary to introduce only a few instances for the information of foreigners.</P>
<P>BACHE, in his paper, No. 1037, after load∣ing the Executive of the United States with va∣rious
<PB N="59" REF="033523_0056_0FF77183DDDFEB30"/>
false and infamous charges, says:
<Q>And are we so corrupted and debased as to give up this precious jewel (Independence) to the in∣trigues of <HI>rascals</HI> and <HI>traitors,</HI> who are about to <HI>sell themselves and their country</HI>?</Q></P>
<P>This is pretty well for the Executive. Now let us hear what CALLENDER (in his
<Q>Histo∣ry of the United States for 1796</Q>)
says of the Congress in a lump—"If a man," says he,
<Q>was to be kept a twelve month in irons, and then to be hanged for stealing <HI>one</HI> horse, what ought to be done with the Congress and their agents, who <HI>forcibly pilfered</HI> so many that are yet un∣paid for?</Q>
—I must leave JUDGE M'KEAN to answer this question; for he was, I believe, one of the Congress that Callender alludes to. However, lest any offender should slip him, the <HI>Historian</HI> takes care to include in his censure, the second, the third, and the fourth Congress.</P>
<P>From the Government in general we will now come to particular members of it.—The Judge tells us, if publications,
<Q>containing per∣sonal invectives, low scurrillity, and slande∣rous charges, were to escape with impunity, the <HI>fairest</HI> and <HI>best characters,</HI> that this or any other country ever produced, would be vilifi∣ed and blasted, if not ruined.</Q></P>
<P>Now then, let us hear BACHE again; the mouth-piece of the French faction, and fre∣quently the companion of the Chief Justice at Civic Festivals.—This atrocious wretch, in his paper of the 9th of July, 1795, has the follow∣ing paragraph:—"The day" [the 4th of July]
<Q><PB N="60" REF="033523_0057_0FF77185CF6519E0"/>was closed by the exhibition of a transparent painting, with the figure of <HI>John Jay</HI> upon it. The figure was in full stature, holding in his right hand a pair of scales, containing in one scale, <HI>American liberty and Independence,</HI> kick∣ing the beam; in the other, <HI>British Gold,</HI> in extreme preponderance. In his left hand a Treaty, which he extended to a group of Se∣nators, who were grinning with pleasure and grasping at the Treaty. From the mouth of the figure issued these words: <HI>come up to my price, and I will sell you my country.</HI> The fi∣gure was burned at Kensington amidst the ac∣clamations of hundreds of citizens. Thus terminated the anniversary of American In∣dependence.</Q></P>
<P>This recalls to our minds two valuable facts: 1st, that this infamous libel did
<Q>escape with impunity!</Q>
and 2d, that the exhibition and actions which it records, did also
<Q>escape with impunity;</Q>
and that too in this city, under the eye of this very Judge M'Kean And, what is more, a gentleman, who, like a good citizen, turned out of his bed to endeavour to put a stop to the scandalous and disgraceful procession, was assaulted in a most cowardly and cruel man∣ner, and never obtained the least satisfaction. Not one of the rabble, nor of the ring-leaders, nor of the printers, who stimulated them to acti∣on, and who recorded their atrocities as honour∣able deeds, was ever punished, or "<HI>bound over,</HI>" or even reprimanded!—But this was a riot and a libel against a <HI>worthy man,</HI> an officer of the <HI>Federal Government,</HI> and <HI>no tool of France</HI>; and
<PB N="61" REF="033523_0058_0FF77188D3A0A498"/>
these circumstances must account for what can∣not otherwise be accounted for.</P>
<P>BACHE, in his paper, No. 1460, calls the Honourable John Jay, then Chief Justice of the United States of America, and now Governor of the State of New-York: he calls this gentle∣man, "that <HI>damned arch traitor</HI> JOHN JAY."— And yet he was never "<HI>bound over</HI>;" and yet he never was <HI>personally attacked from the Bench;</HI> but, on the contrary, has often, since that time as well as before, sat at the same board with the Chief Justice!</P>
<P>I could here name at least one hundred of the greatest and best men, that this country ever produced, who have been vilified by this repro∣bate descendant of Old Franklin; but, for the reasons before mentioned, I shall forbear the enumeration, and content myself with an in∣stance or two of his attacks on the character of GENERAL WASHINGTON, for which every good man, in every part of the world, must and will execrate the libeller and his supporters.</P>
<P>He published PAINE's letter to the GENERAL; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f which he claimed an exclusive copy-right, and which he boasted of having received from Paris for the purpose of publication. In this work, GENERAL WASHINGTON and the CON∣STITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES, are both the objects of obloquy and reproach. The worthy old veteran and statesman, whose endeavours have so eminently contributed to the greatness and prosperity of his country, is called,
<Q>the <HI>patron</HI> of <HI>fraud,</HI></Q>
—
<Q>an <HI>imposter,</HI> or an <HI>apos∣tate.</HI></Q>
<PB N="62" REF="033523_0059_0FF7718EB492B998"/>
—Yet the vile printer was never
<Q>bound over.</Q></P>
<P>Thus was the city of Philadelphia disgraced. Thus did the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania qui∣etly look on, and observe the propagation of a libel, that has excited universal indignation in the breasts of unconcerned foreigners, and for which both the writer and the printer are cen∣sured by their very partizans.</P>
<P>But, this was not the last stab that the literary assassin had in reserve for the character of this great and good man, and for the honour of America.</P>
<P>The day that the GENERAL closed his pub∣lic labours (the 4th of March, 1797,) BACHE, after announcing his retirement from the Office of President, says:
<Q>If there ever was a period for rejoicing this is the moment—every heart, in unifon with the freedom and happiness of the people, ought to beat high with exultation, that the name of WASHINGTON from <HI>this day ceases to give currency to political iniquity,</HI> and to <HI>legalize corruption.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Yet, we are not at the worst: for, on the 13th of March, 1797, this viperous Grand Son of Old Franklin, accused the same eminent person of <HI>murder</HI>! brought forward a long, formal, and circumstantial charge of cool, deliberate <HI>assassi∣nation,</HI>
<Q>committed by <HI>GEORGE WASHINGTON,</HI> late President of the United States.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="033523_0060_0FF7719037594BD8"/>The Chief Justice has <HI>not forgotten,</HI> I dare say, that I was the only printer in the United States (with shame be it spoken) who had the zeal and the industry to search for the documents relative to the affair alluded to (which took place in 1753); to expose the falacy of the charge, and to hold the vile instrument of France up to universal abhorrence.</P>
<P>One would have thought, whatever might be the secret dispositions of the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, that outward appearances, common decency, would have led them to take some little notice of these outrages or a public and private character, respected, es∣teemed, and revered by the wise and the virtu∣ous of all nations. More especially one would have expected this from a Judge, who now seems to be so anxious to preserve the reputa∣tion of "<HI>youth</HI> in its <HI>innocence,</HI>" and of "<HI>old age</HI> in its <HI>gravity</HI> and <HI>wisdom;</HI>" who now, in order to excite a horror against libelling, goes back to that cruel code, the <HI>Twelve Tables of Rome,</HI> and the no less sanguinary laws of <HI>Valentinian</HI>; who, in his zeal to make an example, does not think it derogatory to his honourable station to point at a particular man, and call on the Jury, in ex∣press terms, for their "<HI>aid</HI>" in his punishment; and finally, who expresses his determination to pursue the vice of libelling with "zeal and in∣dignation." From such a Judge, who would not have expected an interference; who does not be∣lieve, who does not know, and does not say, that he should have been "<HI>impressed with the duties of his station,</HI>" when the reputation of the Fede∣ral government was daily and hourly attacked in
<PB N="64" REF="033523_0061_0FF77191C7E604B8"/>
his presence; when the fame and character of GENERAL WASHINGTON were bleeding at every pore, and when the French printer BACHE and his coadjutors were pursuing the Aged Ve∣teran to his domestic retreat with all the hellish malignity of Parisian cannibals?—Yes, this was the time for him to be "<HI>impressed with the du∣ties of his station.</HI>" This was the time for him to exert his authority of <HI>binding over;</HI> to unfold and enforce <HI>the severity of the law,</HI> and estab∣lish his character for <HI>impartiality</HI>:—but, this time is past.</P>
<P>Thus have we seen the Chief Justice of Penn∣sylvania wink at the most daring and wicked libels, against God and against man, that a wri∣ter can conceive or a printer can print. But, we are not yet come to what may be pro∣perly called <HI>a case in point.</HI></P>
<P>I was prosecuted for publications levelled against a foreign prince, government, and mini∣ster; to form therefore a just estimation of the conduct and motives of those who urged the prosecution, we must take a sketch (and a very slight one will serve) of what other printers have published, <HI>with impunity,</HI> against other govern∣ments, nations, and princes.</P>
<P>But, before I enter on this subject, I think myself called on to make a few remarks on that part of the Judge's Charge, which dwells, with such emphasis and seeming dread, on the danger of offending foreign nations and potentates, par∣ticularly the <HI>tender-hearted</HI> rulers of France and the king of the country of the <HI>Inquisition.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="033523_0062_0FF77194A59A6B48"/>After telling the Grand Jury, that I had
<Q>ransacked our language for terms of reproach and insult against every <HI>disti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guished</HI> character in <HI>France and Spain,</HI></Q>
he tells them, that, "without their aid," my conduct cannot be cor∣rected, and concludes by observing, that
<Q>the government that will not discountenance, may be thought to adopt it, and be deemed <HI>justly chargeable with all the consequences.</HI></Q>
—Then follow an instance of the great danger of offend∣ing foreign nations in this way: the Judge re∣fers to history above a hundred years back, and very gravely tells the Grand Jury, that
<Q>Some medals and dull jests are mentioned and repre∣sented as a ground of quarrel between the En∣glish and Dutch in 1672, and likewise caused Lewis the 14th to make an expedition into the United Provinces of the Netherlands in the same year, and nearly ruined that Common∣wealth.</Q></P>
<P>This was an example <HI>in terrorem,</HI> and was evidently cited for the purpose of impressing on the minds of the Jury, the peril that their coun∣try might be placed in from suffering me to "escape with impunity." But, granting for a moment, that laying a restraint on the press, <HI>for fear the effects of its freedom should offend foreign powers</HI>; allowing that such an act is not to the last degree shameful and debasing, and only suited to a country in the most abject state of vassalage; allowing this, let us see if the Judge's quotation was quite correct and candid.</P>
<P>Now, I say, and every one of the most super∣ficial reading knows, that the <HI>medals</HI> and <HI>dull
<PB N="66" REF="033523_0063_0FF7719958B04060"/>
jests</HI> alluded to, never were, nor are they any where (except in this learned Charge)
<Q><HI>mention∣ed</HI> and <HI>represented</HI> as a ground of quarrel be¦tween the English and Dutch in 1672,</Q>
nor at any other period. HUME, who, it will hardly be∣denied, is at least as good an authority as Penn∣sylvania's Chief Judge, does indeed say, that
<Q>certain medals and pictures were made the <HI>miserable pretext</HI> of a most scandalous breach of faith,</Q>
on the part of the profligate Charles II; but he tells us that the <HI>real grounds</HI> of the war, were, the inordinate ambition of Lewis XIV, and the thirst for riches and arbitrary power of the corrupted ministry of England, well known by the name of the CABAL.</P>
<P>Besides had medals and dull jests really been, as they were not, the grounds of the war, can∣dour should have led the Judge to continue his reference to history a little further, and to tell the Grand Jury <HI>how that war terminated,</HI> and how the <HI>nearly ruined Commonwealth behaved</HI> with respect to the medals and dull jests.</P>
<P>Lewis XIV did, indeed, make a devastating and cruel expedition into the Netherlands, and reduced the Dutch to the last extremity by land, while the combined fleets of England and France nearly blocked up their ports and ruined their commerce. In this awful state of their affairs, the two unprincipled Monarchs made known to them their pretensions, which, among many other humiliating terms, specified, that
<Q>all persons guilty of writing <HI>seditious libels</HI> against them, should, on complaint, be banished for ever from the States.</Q>
—The Commonwealth, though,
<PB N="67" REF="033523_0064_0FF771F8E5C547F0"/>
as the Judge says, <HI>nearly ruined,</HI> scorned the in∣solent pretensions; and, following the example of the PRINCE OF ORANGE (afterwards our WILLIAM III, of glorious memory) nobly re∣solved
<Q>to resist the haughty victors, and to de∣fend those last remains of their native soil, of which neither the irruptions of Lewis, nor the inundation of waters, had as yet bereaved them. Should even the ground fail them on which they might combat, they were still re∣solved not to yield the generous strife; but, flying to their settlements in the Indies, erect a new empire in those remote regions, and preserve alive, even in the climates of slavery, that liberty of which Europe was become un∣worthy.</Q></P>
<P>This is what Mr. M'Kean should have told the Grand Jury; and, he should have told them besides, that this brave resolution of the Dutch met with a glorious reward; that a few months saw their gallant fleet a match for those of the two monarchs united, and that the haughty king of France, driven by the PRINCE OF ORANGE from fortress to fortress and from Province to Province, at last entered his vain and frivolous capital covered with defeat and disgrace, before the triumphal arch of St. Dennis, erected for the celebration of his conquests, was completely out of the hands of the architect!</P>
<P>This is the passage of history, which, above all others, the republican car dwells on with pleasure; this is what the Chief Judge should have related to the jury; but, this would not have answered his purpose. Such an example
<PB N="68" REF="033523_0065_0FF771FA68E9D0E0"/>
of republican fortitude and heroism would have sounded well from the lips of his Honour; but, the Grand Jury of Philadelphia showed by their righteous decision, that they stood not in need of examples from history to stimulate them to act agreeably to the dictates of their conscience, and to reject with disdain every idea of fear, that their acquitting an innocent man might bring down on themselves and their country the chas∣tisement of foreign nations.</P>
<P>Before I conclude my remarks on this part of the Charge, I cannot refrain from noticing the very odious impression it is calculated to give the world with respect to the government, and the character of the American nation.</P>
<P>It is well known, that, at the time when the paragraphs against Spain and France were pub∣lished, and when the charge was delivered, the former nation was in the open violation of their treaty with this country, which had just then been grossly insulted by their minister; and that the latter were plundering its commerce in every part of the world, blocking up its rivers, lashing its sea-faring citizens like convicts, and driving its humble negociators from their capital with scorn and reproach. These circumstances ta∣ken into consideration, what must foreigners in∣fer from the Charge? Will they not say, and very justly too:
<Q>such is your <HI>liberty of the press,</HI> such your <HI>boasted independence,</HI> that, let a nation trample on your rights, deride, insult, rob, and torture you, and your government ever stands ready to inflict <HI>the punishment of a murderer</HI> on the first man, who, in resenting
<PB N="69" REF="033523_0066_0FF77258880F6290"/>
your injuries, shall step one inch beside the line of the labyrinthian law of <HI>constructive libels</HI>; and this cruelty it condescends to, lest its lenity to its friends and supporters should give umbrage to an insolent and perfidious foe!</Q>
—Yes; this will they say; and if there be an American, who can patiently bear the disgraceful imputation; I admire his Christian humility; but I envy him not his <HI>liberty,</HI> his <HI>independence,</HI> or his <HI>republicanism.</HI></P>
<P>After all, allowing that America is so beggar∣ed in means and so humbled in spirit; allowing these <HI>independent</HI> states to be already reduced to a pitch of general vassalage, that renders such a sacrifice to the pride and insolence of foreign nations prudent and necessary; allowing that the Judge made all this appear to be true, let us return, and see what the printers <HI>of the French faction</HI> have published against other govern∣ments, nations, and princes, without his feeling himself
<Q>impressed with the duties of his sta∣tion,</Q>
to <HI>bind them over.</HI></P>
<P>Now, reader, prepare yourself for a catalogue of the most indecent, blackest, and most infa∣mously libellous expressions, that ever dropped from the lips or pen of mortal man. The French language is very weak and steril com∣pared to ours, particularly in terms of reproach and abuse. Their rascals spend their breath for half an hour in noisy volubility, to produce a faint idea of what ours can express in one short grind of the teeth. But, all this bitterness, all the force and fury, of this our dear mother tongue, the crafty Gaul has, we are now about to
<PB N="70" REF="033523_0067_0FF77435B95FB6B0"/>
see, had the address to bring over into his own service.</P>
<P>To begin with CALIENDER: this little rep∣tile, who, from outward appearances seems to have been born for a Chimney sweep, and to be now following the sooty trade, made his escape from the hands of Justice in Scotland, in the year 1793, after being apprehended as the author of a libellous pamphlet, entitled
<Q>The Political Pro∣gress of Britain.</Q></P>
<P>This work, which is of considerable bulk, is nothing but a string of falshoods, interspersed with the most audacious libels on the British ministry, and every branch of the Royal Fami∣ly, which latter the author calls, the
<Q>ruffian race of British Kings.</Q>
—In one place he calls the Right Honourable William Pitt, a <HI>hardened Swindler,</HI> and in an other, he calls His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales <HI>a murderer.</HI> He, in one short sentence, consigns to infamy both the Royal Family and the people at large. "Since the Norman Conquest," says he,
<Q>Eng∣land has been governed by thirty-three so∣vereigns; and, of these, two thirds were, each of them by an hundred different actions, <HI>deserving of the gibbet;</HI> and <HI>the people</HI> seem to have been as perfectly divested of every ho∣nourable feeling, <HI>as Majesty itself.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Well, this pamphlet, though abounding in such atrocious libels as these, and though the author in his preface, boasts of having been obliged to fly from his country for publishing it, was re∣published in Philadelphia, and was never <HI>dis∣countenanced</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="033523_0068_0FF7716BE35643C0"/>
by the government or the Chief Justice. Nay CALLENDER says, in his preface, that <HI>certain gentlemen,</HI> and particularly <HI>Mr. Jef∣ferson,</HI> the Vice President of the United States, had <HI>encouraged him</HI> to give an American edition of this infamous performance!</P>
<P>I have a dozen sources to which I could ap∣ply for libels against foreign princes and states. BROWN has been guilty of crimes of this kind without number, and so have DUNLAP and his successors. The CLAYPOOLES, no longer ago than September last, calls Her Majesty the Queen of Portugal a <HI>Crazy Lady</HI> and a <HI>Lunatic.</HI> OS∣WALD, to the day of his death, published at least forty libels regularly, two days in a week; but he is dead; I shall therefore leave him, and come to BACHE, the Chief Judge's companion at Civic Festivals.</P>
<P>There is not a prince or power of Europe, who has discovered the least inclination to op∣pose the French, or discredit their infamous prin∣ciples, whom this caitiff printer and his support∣ers have not libelled in the most outrageous man∣ner.—The Emperor of Germany and his gene∣rals have been called <HI>thieves</HI> and <HI>scoundrels</HI> a thousand times; the King of Prussia, <HI>before his defection,</HI> was called a <HI>Sharper;</HI> the Empress of Russia, in No. 1361, is called a <HI>She-Bear.</HI> But, the British nation, government, and king, have been the constant objects of their most wicked calumnies. Mr. SMITH of Baltimore, in open Congress, called the King of Great Britain,
<Q>a monster; <HI>a</HI> king of sea-robbers.</Q>
His <HI>decent</HI> speech was published in all the papers of that
<PB N="72" REF="033523_0069_0FF7716DB8D97B68"/>
day. BACHE, in his paper, No. 1036, says of Britain, that
<Q>dishonour <HI>mark her</HI> councils and her actions.</Q>
In 1041, he calls the British a "<HI>perfidious nation.</HI>" In 1081, he calls Britain, "that proud tyrannical and <HI>infamous</HI> kingdom." In 1083, he calls the people of Great Britain, "the <HI>bloody savage islanders.</HI>" The government, in various papers, he calls,
<Q><HI>that</HI> corrupt mo∣narchy</Q>
—"that <HI>corrupt government,</HI>"—
<Q>a mix∣ture of <HI>tyranny, profligacy, brutallity,</HI> and <HI>cor∣ruption.</HI></Q>
—In the letters of Franklin, publish∣ed in his paper, he calls Admiral Murry
<Q>free-booter <HI>Murray.</HI></Q>
—In 1033, he calls His Britan∣nic Majesty, "a <HI>prince of robbers.</HI>" In 1048, he calls him,
<Q>that prince of <HI>land and sea rob∣bers,</HI> GEORGE III.</Q>
In 1031, he says, speak∣ing of Great Britain,
<Q>I pledge you my word, that I should heartily rejoice, if <HI>the Royal Fa∣mily,</HI> were <HI>all decently guillotined.</HI></Q>
And, final∣ly, not to tire my readers with the abominations of this atrocious miscreant, he puts a <HI>mock speech</HI> into the mouth of the king of Great Britain, and makes him conclude, as <HI>under the gallows at Tyburn</HI>!</P>
<P>Here are insults, if you talk of insults, to fo∣reign nations. Nor are these the worst. A pam∣phlet once before quoted, called a <HI>Rub from Snub,</HI> has the following "<HI>decent</HI>" lines; I will not call them verses.</P>

<P>Was there ever such abominable outrage as this offered to mortal man any where but in A∣merica? No; since the art of writing was dis∣covered, there never were such libels tolera∣ted against any human being, whether friend or enemy. Yet, neither the government of Penn∣sylvania, nor the Chief Justice, nor any other person in authority, ever interfered. No one, amongst all these libellers, was ever prosecuted or <HI>bound over.</HI> Their <HI>politics were perfectly French,</HI> and all went smoothly on.</P>
<P>Let us for a moment suppose (which, howe∣ver, we have no right to do), that the stupid and

ungenerous prejudice prevailing against Great Britain, formed some trisling excuse for the re∣missness (to give it the mildest term) of the ex∣ecutive and judiciary of the state. Still, this could not apply to the libels published against other nations and princes; some of which had, and now have, <HI>treaties af amity</HI> with this country, and others were not, nor ever had been, its foes.</P>
<P>Amongst these nations there is one, the libels against which I have reserved for this place: I mean <HI>Spain.</HI> For three long years the King of Spain, his government and ministry, were the subject of constant abuse and defamation. BACHE, in No. 1028 of his vile paper, says,
<Q>the <HI>slaves of Madrid</HI> will soon shrink from the con∣querers of Toulon.</Q>
And in No. 1044, he has, speaking of Spain, these words:
<Q><HI>The</HI> most cowardly of the human race;</Q>
—
<Q><HI>the</HI> Spa∣nish slaves;</Q>
—
<Q>the ignorant soldiery of the <HI>infamous tyrant of Castille.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, this is the very same Prince, and the same people, that I have been prosecuted for libelling. Compare what I have said, or rather what I have published, concerning them; com∣pare the passages in the Bill of Indictment with those here quoted, and then praise the impartia∣lity and justice <HI>of the free and equal government of Pennsylvania▪ Don Yrujo</HI> never thought the honour of his Master, when called an <HI>infa∣mous tyrant,</HI> merited his zeal to defend it; nay, the very printer, who thus defamed him, the DON has employed as the printer of his <HI>insolent letter to Mr.</HI> PICKERING! This man's conduct
<PB N="75" REF="033523_0072_0FF7716922ECCFA8"/>
is hardly worth notice; but how shall we ac∣count for the conduct of the Chief Judge of Pennsylvania? Surely the king of Spain's cha∣racter ought to have been an object of his atten∣tion <HI>then</HI> as well as <HI>now;</HI> unless we are willing to allow, that no character is under the protec∣tion of the laws of Pennsylvania, unless it be of <HI>persons devoted to the will of France.</HI></P>
<P>But, before I conclude this comparison be∣tween what I have been most rigorously prosecu∣ted for doing, and what others have done with impunity, I shall give the reader a specimen or two of the conduct of the officers of this Penn∣sylvania Government <HI>(not excluding the Chief Judge himself),</HI> towards foreign nations and princes.</P>
<P><HI>The Governor</HI> (Mifflin), assisted at a civic festi∣val, when the following toasts were drunk; which were published in most of the news-papers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See BACHE of 11 Feb. 1795.</NOTE></P>
<Q><P><HI>Those</HI> illustrious citizens <HI>sent to</HI> Potany Bar. <HI>May they be</HI> speedily recalled <HI>by their country</HI> in the day of her regeneration.</P>

<P>This is pretty "<HI>decent</HI>" in a <HI>Governor;</HI> but, without stopping to remark on the peculiar <HI>de∣cency</HI> of his toasting a gang of <HI>convicts,</HI> let us come to another instance of his conduct, full as "<HI>decent</HI>" as this.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="033523_0073_0FF772622C457F00"/>At the civic festival, held in this city in 1794, to celebrate the dethronement of
<Q>Our great and good ally, Louis XVI,</Q>
there were
<Q>as∣sembled,</Q>
according to the <HI>procés verbal,</HI> which was sent to the Paris Convention,
<Q>the CHIEFS, <HI>civil and military,</HI> of the State of Pennsylva∣nia.</Q>
—The <HI>procés verbal</HI> contains a letter to the Convention, in which the following honour∣able mention is made of the Governor.
<Q>The governor of Pennsylvania, that <HI>ardent friend of the French republic,</HI> was present, and par∣took of <HI>all our enthusiasm,</HI> and <HI>all our senti∣ments.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I believe they spoke truth; for the cannons of the State were fired, and military companies, with drums beating and colours flying, attended the execrable f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te, one of the ceremonies of which, was, <HI>burning the English flag;</HI> and as to the <HI>sentiments,</HI> contained in the <HI>oaths</HI> and <HI>speech∣es</HI> (for there were both), they abounded in in∣sults towards almost all the princes of the earth, but particularly the king of Great Britain.</P>
<P>M'KEAN dwells with great stress on the dan∣ger to be apprehended from insulting foreign nations, more especially those with which we have <HI>negociations pending,</HI> and the <HI>persons with whom we are to treat.</HI> Well then, all the libels that I have here produced, against His Britannic Majesty, his ministers, and his people; and this "<HI>decent</HI>" conduct on the part of "the CHIEFS, <HI>civil and military,</HI> of Pennsylvania," and on the part of the Governor himself; all these libels were published, and this conduct took place, <HI>at the very time, when</HI> MR. JAY <HI>was in England,
<PB N="77" REF="033523_0074_0FF77263AF0A28F8"/>
negociating an amicable adjustment of differences, with the British ministry and their Sovereign</HI>!</P>
<P>The Chief Justice, would, I dare say, be very angry not to be thought included among
<Q>the CHIEFS <HI>civil</HI> and military of the State of Penn∣sylvania;</Q>
but I shall leave nothing to <HI>infer∣ence</HI> or <HI>supposition.</HI> Facts are what I love, and happily his conduct and character is not in want of plenty to illustrate them. I could mention one civic festival at which he assisted, where a "<HI>revolution in Great Britain</HI>" was toasted; and another, where a toast was,
<Q>Success to the Uni∣ted Irishmen,</Q>
then in open rebellion against their king; but, these would not, in point of time be quite to my purpose: I shall, therefore, come to one instance of his conduct that is so. It is a sort of companion piece to his Charge, and it shall, for that reason, be put exactly upon a parallel with it.</P>

<CELL><Q><P>At a time when misun∣derstandings prevail between the Republics of the U∣nited States and France, and when our general go∣vernment have appointed public ministers to endea∣vour their removal and re∣store the former harmony some of the journals or news∣papers in the city of Phila∣delphia have teemed with the most irritating invec∣tives, couched in the most vulgar and opprobrious lan∣guage, not only against the
<PB N="78" REF="033523_0075_0FF772674CA5B390"/>
French nation and their al∣lies, but the very men in power with whom the mi∣nisters of our country are sent to negociate. These publications have an evident tendency not only to frus∣trate a reconciliation, but to create a rupture and pro∣voke a war between the sis∣ter Republics, and seem cal∣culated to vilify, nay to sub∣vert all <HI>Republican</HI> govern∣ments whatsoever.</P>
<P><HI>Impressed with the duties of my station,</HI> I have used some endeavours for check∣ing these evils, by binding over the editor and printer of one of them, licentious and virulent beyond all for∣mer example, to his good behaviour; but he still per∣severes in his nefatious pub∣lications; he has ransacked our language for terms of reproach and insult, and for the basest accusations against every ruler and distinguish∣ed character in France and Spain, with whom we chance to have any intercourse, which it is scarce in nature to forgive; in brief, he braves his recognizance and the laws. It is now with you, gentlemen of the grand jury, to animadvert on his conduct; without your aid it cannot be corrected. The government that will not dis∣countenance, may be thought to adopt it, and be deemed justly chargeable with all the consequences.</P></Q></CELL>
<CELL><P>At a time when misunder∣standings prevailed between this country and <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and when the General Go∣vernment had appointed <HI>Mr. Jay,</HI> and sent him to Eng∣land to endeavour to remove them, many news-papers and pamphlets in this city of Phi∣ladelphia, teemed with the most false, most vile, and most rascally abuse, not only against the British nation and their allies, but also against the ve∣ry ministers, and the very mo∣narch, with whom he was sent
<PB N="78" REF="033523_0075_0FF772674CA5B390"/>
to treat. These publications had an evident tendency, not only to frustrate a reconcilia∣tion, so necessary to the peace, prosperity, and happiness of America, but to provoke a destructive war between the two nations; and were, be∣sides, calculated to vilify, and subvert, all <HI>lawful</HI> and <HI>good</HI> government whatsoever.</P>
<P>Yet, THOMAS M'KEAN, the Chief Justice of Pennsyl∣vania, <HI>never was impressed with the duties of his station,</HI> so far as to use any the most feeble endeavour for checking these evils. He never did punish, or prosecute, or bind over, or reprimand, one of the infa∣mous authors, printers, or publishers; but on the contra∣ry, when the unratified treaty was promulgated, he appeared at the head of a committee in the State-House yard, sur∣rounded with a vast concourse of rabble, assembled for the evident and avowed purpose of preventing its ratification. Here <HI>Hamilton Rowan</HI> was, on motion from the chair, welcomed with many cheers; the rabble were called on to <HI>kick the damned treaty to hell,</HI> and they afterwards went and <HI>burnt it,</HI> with every mark of hatred and insult, <HI>opposite the door of the British Embassa∣dor!</HI></P></CELL>

</TABLE></P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="033523_0076_0FF7726BEB517E28"/>There is the text, reader: make the comment yourself; for I have not language to do justice to the indignant feelings that it excites in my breast.—Sum up the evidence, and judge of the candour and impartiality of the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania. All that could be conjured up against me, was included in the Bill of Indict∣ment, the very harshest expression to be found in which, is, my calling the king of Spain a
<Q>de∣generate Prince:</Q>
while I have proved, from papers and pamphlets now in print, and to be come at by every one, that others have printed, and published to the world, that Mr. Jay is a "damned arch traitor;" General Washington a
<Q>patron of fraud, a legalizer of corruption, and an assassin;</Q>
that the Empress of Russia is a "she bear," the king of Prussia "a sharper," the Queen of Portugal a "lunatic," the Prince of Wales a "murderer," the king of Great Bri∣tain a
<Q>brute, a monster, a rascal, and a robber, worthy of the gibbet;</Q>
and, lastly, that the king of Spain, whom I only called a degenerate prince, has been boldly declared to be
<Q>an in∣famous tyrant!</Q>
—And, I again and again re∣peat, that the Chief Justice has suffered all this to pass immediately under his sight, unprosecu∣ted, unreproved, and unnoticed; while my pub∣lications have been watched with a never-slum∣bering eye, and prosecuted with a rigour unpa∣ralleled; while two thirds of a charge to a Grand Jury have been directly pointed at my person; while every severe maxim of our own law has been sought out; and, as if all this were not enough, while the bloody twelve tables of Rome and the laws of Valentinian have been resorted to, in order to excite a horror of
<PB N="80" REF="033523_0077_0FF7726D6E0BDB68"/>
my offence, and to draw down punishment on my head, for publishing what an enlightened and honest Grand Jury has determined, <HI>not to be li∣bellous</HI>!</P>
<P>How difficult soever the reader may here find it to repress the emotions, which such hitherto unheard of conduct is calculated to excite, I must beg him not to indulge them, 'till I have drawn his attention to a fact, which, in the crowd of matter, I dare say has escaped him.</P>
<P>I have amply proved, that the pretended li∣bels, for which I have been prosecuted, are to the real ones, published by others, what the glare of a taper is to a city in flames. I have proved that the very monarch, whom I termed a
<Q>de∣generate prince,</Q>
has been, by others, pro∣claimed as "an infamous tyrant." But, there was yet one fact wanting to render this scanda∣lous prosecution complete; and that fact is at hand.</P>
<P>The reader, by turning back to page 36, will perceive, that one of my
<Q>false, scandalous, and malicious libels,</Q>
as they are most falsly and scandalously called, did not originate with me, nor in my paper. It was copied from Mr. FEN∣NO's paper <HI>of an anterior date.</HI> This material circumstance was, very cautiously and <HI>candidly,</HI> kept <HI>out of the Bill of Indictment,</HI> though the heads and titles of the other two publications were mentioned; and there is every reason to believe, that it escaped the attention of the Grand Jury.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="033523_0078_0FF7726F028D7528"/>The Indictment, as is usual, concludes with stating the tendency of the crime, part of which is,
<Q>the <HI>evil example</HI> of all others in the like case offending.</Q>
This is most certainly very proper: for, to prevent the effects of <HI>evil exam∣ple,</HI> is, or ought to be, the principle object of all punishments. But, how could I be said to set the <HI>evil example,</HI> when it was notorious that I had been far surpassed by others, who had never been called to account, and when the very pub∣lication, for which I was prosecuted, I had co∣pied, word for word, from another printer, a na∣tive of the country, and living in the same city with myself? Mr. FENNO has never been <HI>bound over.</HI> He has never been arrested: nor has he been even spoken to on the subject. He has heard of my being prosecuted; but he little imagines it was for his crimes.</P>
<P>Thus, in the capital of America, amidst all its <HI>vaunted liberty of the press,</HI> and under the "<HI>equal</HI>" and "<HI>humane</HI>" laws of Pennsylvania, another man has been allowed to print and publish, not only with impunity, but without reproof, a para∣graph, for the re-publishing of which, I have been seized as a criminal, exposed to the danger of a heavy fine, of imprisonment at hard labour, of being crammed in a dungeon, and <HI>of suffering the punishment of a murderer</HI>!</P>
<P>Is this your <HI>republican</HI> justice! Is this the blessed fruit of that <HI>liberty,</HI> to obtain which all the horrors of a revolution are to be encounter∣ed, kings are to be hurled from their thrones, and nations deluged in blood! Was it for this that America maintained a ten years desolating
<PB N="82" REF="033523_0079_0FF772743743C420"/>
war; that all the ties of interest, of allegiance, of friendship, and of nature were rent assunder, and that a hundred thousand of her sons were stretched dead on the plain!—Talk not to me of your sovereign people, and your universal suf∣ferage; of your political liberty and your equal rights: they are empty sounds, which I regard not. Give me security for my person and pro∣perty; or, at least, let me share the fate of my neighbour.
<Q>Send us (said the Israelites of old); Send us, O Lord, a king, that he may render us <HI>justice.</HI></Q>
To ensure this last mentioned inestimable blessing, is the end of civil society, and ought to be the great object of all political institutions. <HI>Justice</HI> is the soul of freedom, as <HI>impartiality</HI> is the soul of justice; and, without these, <HI>liberty</HI> is an impostor and <HI>law</HI> is a farce.</P>
<P>I should here bid the reader adieu, leaving him to pour out his soul, like Judge M'Kean, in hosannahs for the
<Q>temporal blessings of the Representative Democracy, which the Al∣mighty, <HI>in his great mercy,</HI> has vouchsafed unto us;</Q>
but I have pledged myself to prove, that <HI>the British press is much free-er than that of America;</HI> and, notwithstanding
<Q>the blessings, in great mercy, vouchsafed unto us,</Q>
I fear not, that, with the indulgence of the reader, I shall make good my promise. For the motives from which I do this I am responsible to no one: if, however, an apology is thought necessary, let it be sought for in the abominable treatment I have experienced.</P>
<P>Since the revolution, which terminated in the independence of these States, almost every pub∣lication
<PB N="83" REF="033523_0080_0FF7727703A424E8"/>
here, and every democratic one in Great Britain, has held the liberty of the American press up in triumphant exaltation over that of the press of Great Britain. How many vo∣lumes might be filled up with instances of this fort! How many thousand times is the vain boast repeated in the course of each revolving sun! To refer to particular publications is like seek∣ing for proofs of daylight or of darkness: but, there is one that I must refer to, because it so aptly answers my purpose. It is a letter of the arch sectarian PRIESTLEY, who, not content without companions in his fallen state, has spar∣ed no pains to inveigle his countrymen hither. He tells the people of England, in this letter, sent there to be published, that "<HI>Here</HI> (in <HI>italicks</HI> to mark the contrast)
<Q><HI>Here</HI> the press is free. <HI>Here</HI> truth is not a libel.</Q>
This satanic letter contains many other assertions equally <HI>false,</HI> which I may one day or other expose; but, at present, I notice only what appertains to my sub∣ject.</P>
<P>The poor Doctor was always a bold asserter; but, in the case before us, I must confess, a more scrupulous man might have been led into the adoption of a falshood. The peal has been so incessantly rung in our ears. We have been so bored with it in all seasons, at all hours, eating, drinking and sleeping time not excepted, that it required a degree of incredulity rarely to be met with to resist the temptation to belief. The asser∣tion is, nevertheless false; and it is a falshood too, which the safety of every one (particularly <HI>a foreigner</HI>), who touches pen or types, requires to be clearly and fully exposed.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="033523_0081_0FF77279BA42CF68"/><HI>That</HI> TRUTH <HI>may be a libel in Great Britain, and that it cannot be a libel here,</HI> is generally be∣lieved; and is thought to constitute the differ∣ence in the laws of the two countries, on this head. But this is no more than a vulgar notion, taken up from ignorance, and propagated from vanity and envy. I defy any man to produce me a single law, or a single constitution (for, "thank God," as the Judge says, we have ma∣ny); I defy him to cite me a clause or sentence, that says, or that leaves room to suppose, that <HI>truth</HI> may not be deemed a libel, here as well as in England. The United States, and the individual States of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Ver∣mont, Maryland, North Carolina, and Kentuc∣key, each of them say, that
<Q><HI>the</HI> press ought to be free,</Q>
in a short vague sentence, of which any lawyer of a common capacity would give as many different interpretations as there can be rung changes upon twelve bells, which are said to amount to some millions. Pennsylvania and Tennesee say the same, and more. They say, with the other States, and with the laws of Eng∣land, that <HI>the press shall be free;</HI> and they add, that
<Q>in prosecutions for the publication of pa∣pers, investigating the <HI>official</HI> conduct of <HI>officers,</HI> or where the matter published is <HI>proper for public information,</HI> the <HI>truth</HI> thereof may be given in evidence.</Q>
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia, have had the prudence to say no∣thing at all about the matter; and, as to Rhode Island, its constitution is neither more nor less than a new edition of the Charter granted them by
<Q>the abundant grace, certain knowledge, and mere motion</Q>
of King Charles II. Thus it
<PB N="85" REF="033523_0082_0FF7727CCB7A9558"/>
stands, bound up with the other sixteen constitu∣tions, without the addition or exclusion of a sin∣gle word. And, all the other States, without one exception, have taken special care to bind down their rulers <HI>never to deprive them of the common law of England,</HI> but to preserve it inviolate to them and their children. Amidst all their va∣ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, when they were stark staring drunk with revolutionary triumph, they had the good sense, the saving grace, to cling fast round this old trunk of solid and substantial liberty. Long may they hold by it, and never suffer it to be chipped away by quibbling statutes and partial Judges!</P>
<P>Hence then, it happens, very luckily for me, that, if there be any State, in which the common law of England, respecting libels, is departed from, it is poor Pennsylvania. And, what is the mighty "blessing" she has had
<Q>vouchsafed unto her?</Q>
Why,
<Q>in prosecutions for the publication of papers investigating the <HI>official</HI> conduct of <HI>officers,</HI> or where the matter pub∣lished is <HI>proper for public information,</HI> the <HI>truth</HI> may be <HI>given in evidence.</HI></Q>
So that, you will please to observe, Messieurs authors and prin∣ters, that, first, the person about whom you pub∣lish must be <HI>an officer;</HI> and next, you must touch upon nothing but his <HI>official</HI> conduct. Precious privilege! It is a mere net to catch the unwary: it leaves not the least scope for censuring any public man whatsoever, but seems, on the con∣trary, intended to shelter his faults and his crimes from the lash of the press. By declaring that the <HI>truth</HI> shall be admitted as evidence as to such publications only as touch his <HI>official</HI> conduct, his private character and conduct are held up as sacred and inviolable.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="033523_0083_0FF77280191F32B8"/>But, the Judge, the expositor of the constitu∣tion, goes still further. He tells us, that the pub∣lications, respecting the <HI>official</HI> conduct of offi∣cers, must not only be <HI>true,</HI> but "<HI>candid</HI>" and "<HI>decent</HI>" also. This is a maxim laid down in his charge, and every one will agree, that he was ready to put it in practice. Comfortable writing and publishing it must be, thus penned up with vague and indefinite epithets! <HI>Truth</HI> may be de∣fined and ascertained, but what publication is there, which, by some quirk or other, might not be represented as <HI>uncandid</HI> or <HI>indecent</HI>?—Yet, as if this left the press still <HI>too free.</HI> The Judge tells us, that such publications, must not only be <HI>decent, candid,</HI> and <HI>true,</HI> but, besides all this, they must "have an eye <HI>solely</HI> to the <HI>public good.</HI>— Here is a pretty latitude for quibble and contes∣tation! Not only the <HI>fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> are to be established, and the <HI>manner</HI> and <HI>stile</HI> approved of by the court, but even the <HI>motives</HI> of the writer are to be enquired into, and may be construed into a ground for punishing him!</P>
<P>One would now think that the officers of Penn∣sylvania were safely enough fortified against the attacks of the press; but the Chief Justice was resolved to guard them at every point; and there∣fore, after throwing up bastions in abundance and out-works upon out-works, he surrounds the whole with a line of contravalation, thus:
<Q>Where libels are printed against <HI>persons employ∣ed in a public capacity,</HI> they receive an <HI>aggrava∣tion,</HI> as they tend to <HI>scandali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the government.</HI></Q>
Charming liberty of the press! Against men thus defended, what devil of a printer is there, who will ever dare to fire a single shot? Suppose, for
<PB N="87" REF="033523_0084_0FF7728336F74618"/>
instance, that a Judge were to be guilty of some most vile and infamous offence: suppose he were <HI>to thieve;</HI> one would think that a free press should take some little notice of it; but you must not do it, because thieving is not (or, at least, I am sure, it ought not to be) the <HI>official</HI> conduct of a Judge, and therefore the truth cannot be given in evidence; and because the libel would "receive an aggravation," as it would most cer∣tainly "tend to <HI>scandalize the government.</HI>"— Thus is the press of Pennsylvania nailed down; but if such a thing had happened in England, or in France previous to the revolution, the prin∣ters would have blazoned it from one end of the empire, nay, from one end of the world to the other; and if they could have found a convey∣ance to the Moon, thither it would have went. It is right to curb such "licentious" fellows. Their blabbing ought to be prevented; and for doing this give me not a mighty kingdom with standing armies and letters de cachet, but give me a little sang "Representative Democracy," armed with the power of <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nding them over at disc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etion,</HI> and inflicting on them <HI>the punishment of a murderer.</HI></P>
<P>As to the latter provision of the clause above quoted, that the <HI>truths</HI> published must be <HI>proper for public information,</HI> it is far worse than nothing; for, what is <HI>proper for public information</HI> is no libel according to the common law, and there∣fore no <HI>truth,</HI> nor any evidence whatsoever, is necessary to justify its publication, in the eye of that law; but, according to the new maxim, what is very proper for public information may be a libel, if the truth of every word of it cannot be established.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="033523_0085_0FF77284C462FC60"/>I think I have now satisfied the reader, that, in point of law, the American press has gained nothing over that of Great Britain. But, the Chief Justice, as if he really intended to aid my undertaking, and to do away every doubt on the subject, took good care to tell the Grand Jury, that, <HI>with respect to libels, the common law was confirmed and established by the Constitution itself.</HI> Where then is the advantage derived from the new order of things? If the constitution of Penn∣sylvania, which is, according to the modern ap∣plication of the word, the free-est in America; if this constitution has done <HI>no more</HI> than confirm and establish the common law of England, with respect to the liberty of the press, how can any man have the impudence to boast of that liberty being greater here than it is in England, where that same common law still exists in all its pleni∣tude and purity, and is administered by men the most learned, independent and righteous in the world?</P>
<P>Thus far then, the liberty of the press, is, in the eye <HI>the law,</HI> the same in both countries; but this does not prove, that there exist no circumstances in America, peculiar to it, which render the exer∣cise of this liberty unsafe, and of course restrains its operations. It is not only the principles pro∣fessed in a country, that we are to look to, but also the <HI>practice</HI> of that country. The thing cal∣led the constitution of France, for example, says that the <HI>free use</HI> of the press is a right <HI>sacred</HI> and <HI>inviolable;</HI> but this does not prevent the tyrants from seizing the printers by scores, and trans∣porting them without a trial and without a hear∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="033523_0086_0FF7728646C5F2A0"/>The press has been, and still is, restrained in this country, 1st, by the notion, which has been, for evident motives, inculcated by artful men, that no <HI>private character</HI> ought to be publickly censured. 2nd, by the very dangerous privilege, which <HI>foreign agents</HI> possess, in having <HI>a choice of governments,</HI> under which to bring their pro∣secutions. And, 3rd, by the terror, necessarily excited in every printer, by the <HI>disgraceful and cruel punishment,</HI> to which he is liable.</P>
<P>As to the first of these restraints, nothing can give us a better idea of the extent to which it is carried, than the bold assertions contained in the Chief Judge's Charge. He tells us, that though a publication may not reflect any moral turpi∣tude on the party, it may yet be libelious, if it <HI>thwarts the said party's desire of appearing agree∣able in life.</HI> This is a very comfortable doctrine to every <HI>scoundrel,</HI> and particularly to every <HI>whore,</HI> for you will not find one of either description, who does not desire <HI>to appear agreeable in life.</HI> The reasonableness of this doctrine his Honour supports by telling us, that if any man does wrong, recourse may be had to the courts of justice, and that there can be no necessity, <HI>nor reason,</HI> for ap∣peals to the people in <HI>news-papers</HI> or <HI>pamphlets.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, you see, if his Honour shuts up the press, he has the goodness to open his court to us. But, if I were to see one officer of government go stag∣gering drunk through the street, on his return from a civic festival; or another from the same cause, reeling into his seat, must I hold my tongue, or go to law with them? If a swindler, a man of the basest character, the most treacherous and cor∣rupt
<PB N="90" REF="033523_0087_0FF7728C74790778"/>
of mortals, were to propose himself as a candidate for a seat in the Legislature, must I say nothing about him; must I not throw out even a hint to the people to warn them of their danger? If a Judge, or any other awful character, were to be detected in shop-lifting, or in the commis∣sion of any such base and infamous crime; or if a lady were to choose, now and then, to relieve her husband by retiring a few months to the arms of a friend, must I sew up my lips, and must my press be as tame and contented as the cuckold himself?</P>
<P>Such may, indeed, be the practice of the Ame∣rican press; but is it that of the press of Great Britain. Only compare one of the London papers with an American paper, and you will soon see which comes from the free-est press. Is there a crime, is there a fault or a folly, which the edi∣tors and print-sellers in London do not lash? They dive into every assembly and every house; they spare characters neither public nor private; neither the people, the gentry, the clergy, the nobility nor the royal family itself, is sheltered from their ridicule or their censure. Let any American but open PETER PINDAR's works and the LONDON MORNING CHRONICLE; then let him read Judge M'Kean's Charge, and blush at the boast that has been so often made about the liberty of the press.</P>
<P>I am far from approving of all, or of hardly any thing, contained in the works of Pindar and the Morning Chronicle: the Chronicle is the devoted tool of an infamous Jacobin faction, and the far greater part of Pindar's monotonous
<PB N="91" REF="033523_0088_0FF7728E66AF1B50"/>
odes are an outrage on decency, on truth, and on every principle, moral and religious, by which a man of learning and talents ought to be direct∣ed. But, because public censure and ridicule, when grounded on <HI>falshood,</HI> is unjustifiable, it by no means follows, that the press is to exercise no sort of censorship at all; that it is not to re∣cord evil as well as righteous deeds; that it is not to check the follies and vices of the times; that it is not to exert its wholesome and mighty influence in society, but become the mere echo of the bench and the bar. No; this does not follow; yet, this is the practice of the American press.</P>
<P>Come to my office, reader, and look over (if you have patience) the leaden sheets that are hither dragged from every quarter of the coun∣try. If they have one single shaft of satire, ex∣cept it be on the old hackneyed subject of king-craft and priest-craft, I will suffer you to suffo∣cate me by reading me their contents.—And what is the reason of this? Is it that this blessed
<Q>Representative Democracy, which, <HI>in great mercy,</HI> has been vouchsafed unto us,</Q>
preserves us unsusceptible of folly or vice? Is it that we are all wise, moral, religious, and pure as the driven snow? Is it, my God! that we know of no such thing as drunkenness, adultery, swind∣ling, corruption, or blasphemy? Or is it that we wish to keep these things hidden from the world?—If this could be done, and if silence would produce a reformation. I would willingly consent,—not to become as tame and insipid as my brethren, but to throw my press into the river. But, this is impossible; since whatever exists, is,
<PB N="92" REF="033523_0089_0FF7728FE95373D8"/>
and must be, known; and since wickedness the longer it remains unchastised, the more inve∣terate it becomes; since this is the case, the most rigid censorship in the press is absolutely neces∣sary, to check, in time, that which, if suffered to pass unnoticed, will most certainly, sooner or later, end in general degradation and ruin.</P>
<P>Yet, this timely check; this salutary and cost∣less chastisement, must remain a useless instru∣ment in our hands, because, forsooth, the villain and the strumpet
<Q>desire to appear agreeable in life,</Q>
and because an exposure of their turpi∣tude will "<HI>stain the honour of their families!</HI>" For this cogent reason, the good and the bad, the upright statesman and the traitor, the man of integrity and the rogue, the virtuous matron and the whore, are all to be jumbled to-gether, and the world is to take us in the lump, or nor at all.</P>
<P>But, may it please your Honour, this will not do. We know well, that the world is very ill∣natured, and that, when it judges in the lump, it very seldom looks at the best side. Men of reputation, therefore, do not approve of this jumbling work. They wish to be distinguished from those that have none. This can be done only by the detecting of vice, and exposing it to public censure; and I beg your Honour's leave to add one concluding observation of my own, which is this; <HI>that I never yet know a single per∣son, man or woman, extremely anxious to restrain the liberty of the press, in this respect, who had not very sufficient reasons for so doing.</HI></P>
<P>The next restraint on the freedom of the Ame∣rican press, is, the very alarming privilege, which
<PB N="93" REF="033523_0090_0FF7742CCDD828B0"/>
<HI>foreign agents</HI> possess, in having <HI>a choice of go∣vernments,</HI> under which to bring their prosecu∣tions.</P>
<P>I have already, in the former part of this pamphlet, said how the press, in various parts of the country, has been kept in slavery by the unpunished violences of the domineering French faction; and, in the relation of the treatment I have met with, I have clearly proved what every printer, of any independence of spirit has to ex∣pect from another quarter. This situation of things, however, has been produced by a combi∣nation of singular circumstances, and it may pro∣bably wear away as those circumstances change. But, the evil, of which I have now to complain, is of a nature not to be worn away by the hand of time alone. It is built on law and constitution, or, at least, it operates as if it were, and admits of no remedy, except by some positive act of a convention or the legislature.</P>
<P>It was hoped (though, it must be confessed, with very little reason), that America, when se∣parated from Great Britain, would never more be affected by the quarrels of European nations. PAINE told the people, that they would have no∣thing to do but grow rich, while other nations should be at war. "Our commerce," says he,
<Q>will always secure us the <HI>peace and friendship</HI> of all Europe.</Q>
This, by woeful experience, we find to have been like all the rest of shallow∣headed Paine's predictions. But this is not the worst. Not only does America feel the pressure of European wars, in a degree equal to that felt by the people of Great Britain at this moment;
<PB N="94" REF="033523_0091_0FF7742E51C1B338"/>
but she is cursed with a foreign faction in her bosom, by which she is continually curbed, har∣rassed, injured, insulted, and betrayed.</P>
<P>The politics of the country are become so connected, so interwoven, with the politics of other nations, France in particular, that they are never spoken of in any other than a relative light. I verily believe, and indeed I am cer∣tain, that, as to numbers, men are more equally divided, at this time, between the Federal govern∣ment and the French, than they were in the year 1778, between the Congress and the King of England.</P>
<P>Nor does this pernicious division stop here. The State governments have their sides. One State is called a <HI>Federal State</HI> and another an <HI>Antifederal State:</HI> and it is notorious, that the politics of the persons, who administer these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣altern governments, are generally fixed and uniform on one side or the other.</P>
<P>In such a state of things, only think of the danger of allowing foreign ministers and agents <HI>to choose the government, under which to bring their prosecutions!</HI> Possessing this dreadful pri∣vilege, will not every foreign agent take good care to institute his prosecutions under that go∣vernment, to which the party prosecuted has, by his politics, rendered himself obnoxious? And, where this can be done, what sort of chance, I pray, is there for a man who meddles with the press, and who happens to be situated in a State, where he must of necessity be obnoxious to one of the two governments, under which he lives?</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="033523_0092_0FF77430F21CB088"/>My own case is a striking exemplification of the danger of this privilege. Yrujo the Spaniard applied first to the Federal Government to pro∣secute me, and was informed that it would be done in the Federal courts. But, this he remon∣strated against, and requested that it might be done in the courts of Pennsylvania; in which courts M'Kean is Chief Judge.—Now, why this request? Why prefer one jurisdiction to another? The courts are held at the same place, and near∣ly at the same time. The Judges of the Federal court are men famous for their learning and their integrity; and, I am sure, ordering the trial in this court ought to have been looked upon as a mark of respect to the Spanish King. How, then, are we to account for this extraordinary request?</P>
<P>Leaving the reader to account for it in his own way, I shall tell him that the request was refused; and that, then, a new prosecution was set on foot under the government of Pennsylva∣nia. The matter contained in the above bill of Indictment was hunted out; and, let it be well remembered, that every pretended libel con∣tained in this bill, was published <HI>before I was bound over on the first complaint.</HI> In possession of this fact, the reader will be able to guess what the hopes of the prosecutor were founded on.</P>
<P>The matter in the bill of indictment, if libel∣lous, was surely so before I was bound over the first time. How comes it then, that it was not included in the first complaint? This puzzled the Grand Jury. The thing appeared so unna∣tural to them, that they sent for the two Attorneys
<PB N="96" REF="033523_0093_0FF774336A9A6710"/>
General to explain the mystery; when it was found, that they had taken care, in drawing their indictments, to steer clear of each other; in do∣ing which I, by-the-bye, do not mean to hint, that either of these gentlemen did any more than his duty.</P>
<P>Thus was seen the singular phenomenon of a printer prosecuted by <HI>two governments,</HI> at one and the same time, for different parts of one and the same offence! And this is <HI>American liberty of the press!</HI></P>
<P>Did Englishmen ever hear of any thing of this kind before? No; they have <HI>one</HI> Government, <HI>one</HI> law, and <HI>one</HI> constitution for all. In their country, neither foreigner nor native, plaintiff nor defendant, has a choice of jurisdictions, tri∣bunals, or judges. Where the offence is com∣mitted, there must it be tried. They have no clashing of governments of opposite politics, un∣der which every printer is in hourly danger, from the intrigues of foreign agents, and is obliged to tack and shift, like a polacre with contending winds between Sylla and Charibdis. No; in England, all is fair and free. The path is sim∣ple: the law is one and the same, and is equal in its operations in every place and towards all parties. It is founded in wisdom and in justice, and is administered with candour, impartiality, and mercy.</P>
<P>The third restraint on the liberty of the Ame∣rican press, and the last which I shall notice, <HI>at this time</HI> is, <HI>the fear which must be naturally ex∣cited in every writer and printer, by the disgrace∣ful and cruel punishment, to which he is continu∣ally exposed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="033523_0094_0FF7716537E280D8"/>After all that we have heard and seen about the <HI>mildness</HI> and <HI>humanity</HI> of the American laws; after all the cant of the <HI>tender-hearted</HI> Brissot; after all the silly enlogiums on the prisons of Philadelphia, spread abroad in pamphlets, speech∣es, and paragraphs; and after all the sarcastic and acrimonious invective which the American press is continually pouring out against the <HI>san∣guinary</HI> code of Great Britain: bored with all this, I say, even to surfeiting, my present com∣plaint must appear very extraordinary. Let it. All that I have to do, is to prove it well founded.</P>
<P>The liberty of doing any thing, is greater or less, in proportion to the punishment that the law awards for it. I am, therefore, far from pre∣tending that the Americans do not, in some re∣spects, possess more liberty than the English. They are in less danger, when they steal, rob, forge, coin, and murder; for, these crimes are here punished with <HI>fine, jail imprisonment, im∣prisonment at hard labour,</HI> or <HI>solitary confinement</HI>; whereas, in England, they are punished with <HI>death.</HI> But, let those, who have reason, boast of this sort of liberty. It is not what I want. I only contend for liberty to write and to print.</P>
<P>This liberty is a right, sanctioned by law, as far as a certain line, all beyond which is called libelling. This line reaches, as I have clearly proved, just as far in America as it does in Eng∣land, and no farther. All that we have to do then is to see, which country inflicts punishments the <HI>least severe</HI> on transgressors; for, in that country the press must be <HI>most free.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="033523_0095_0FF774381726F0E0"/>By only casting our eyes on the Chief Judge's Charge, we shall perceive, that the punishments are ten fold more severe in America than in England. In England, a transgressor of the laws of the press, or, in other words, a libeller, is pu∣nishable by <HI>fine,</HI> by <HI>imprisonment in jail,</HI> by <HI>standing in the pillory</HI>; or by any two, or all three, of them. But, what is his punishment in America? Why, in the first place, <HI>fine</HI> and <HI>jail imprisonment,</HI> as in England, and to these may be added, imprisonment <HI>at hard labour,</HI> and even <HI>solitary confinement in a dungeon,</HI> at the <HI>discretion of the court;</HI> and all this too in a country, where the prosecutor may have <HI>a choice of courts</HI>!</P>
<P>As far as relates to <HI>fines</HI> and <HI>jail imprisonment,</HI> the code of the two countries is the same; but, instead of the momentary shame of the pillory, the American libeller, whether writer or printer, is liable to the lasting pain and disgrace of hard labour, and to the more horrid punishment of the dungeon. Standing in the pillory, which is the worst an English libeller can undergo, is over in a few hours. The sufferer is then placed in jail, where he is as free as a detention of his per∣son will admit of. He can see, hear, read and converse. He is at case; can be visited by his friends; nay, <HI>Callender</HI> (the run-away Scotch∣man) boasts, that his associates even sold their libels in Newgate. What is this punishment compared to continual <HI>hard labour</HI>? And what is hard labour, or any thing else, compared to being thrown into a cell, and cut off, not only from friends and family, but from every human being?</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="033523_0096_0FF7743AC063ABA0"/>But, we must not drop the subject here. Pu∣nishments, as to their influence in society, and consequently as to their restraint on the press, must be considered <HI>relatively;</HI> for, what may be a very light punishment in one country, may be a very heavy, and even a very cruel one, in another. In England, for instance, robbery, forgery, mur∣der, &amp;c. are punished with <HI>death:</HI> in America these crimes are punished with <HI>har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> labour,</HI> or <HI>solitary confinement.</HI> So that, to inflict these lat∣ter punishments on a libeller <HI>here,</HI> is exactly as cruel as it would be to inflict death on him in England.</P>
<P>What were the motives of the rulers, who lessened the punishment for <HI>murder,</HI> and other hor∣rid crimes, while they augmented the punishment for <HI>libelling,</HI> I must leave those to determine, who boast so much about the liberty of their press; but, this I will undertake to say, that it is most excellently well calculated to restrain, intimi∣date, and over awe, every one who has any thing to do with writing and printing. What man will ever dare to communicate his thoughts to the public, while it is probable, or even <HI>possible,</HI> that his writing will procure him a place in that "<HI>temple</HI> of <HI>humanity,</HI>" as it has been called, the Philadelphia prison; where, dressed in a jail uniform, penned up amongst run-away thieving negro slaves; amongst robbers, forgers, sodom∣ites, and murderers; where, in short, amongst convicts of every colour and of every crime, he is employed in the polite art of pounding hemp, with the infinite satisfaction of being exhibited to travelling <HI>philanthropists</HI> as a
<Q>living monu∣ment of American <HI>mildness</HI> and <HI>humanity</HI>?</Q>—
<PB N="100" REF="033523_0097_0FF7743DF5B73880"/>
And, if this be too much for a man of reputation and talents to bear, how shall he dare to brave the horrors of a cell; to be secluded from friends, parents, wife, children, and all that ren∣ders life worth possessing; to be barred up for months, or for years, like a condemned malefac∣tor; and this too at the discretion of a court, chosen, perhaps, by his prosecutor?</P>
<P>Did Englishmen . . . . . . . . . . . but, why do I pursue in the odious comparison?—Did even Frenchmen ever feel a restraint like this?—The Bastile!—it was bad enough, to be sure; but, a writer confined there, had, at least, the consola∣tion of knowing, that he was distinguished from felons and murderers. Though far too severely punished, he was not covered with everlasting disgrace and infamy. Literature, though the abuse of it was cruelly chastised, was not degra∣ded, was not rendered at once hateful and des∣picable, as it is by the indiscriminating code of Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding all we have seen, the Chief Judge has the modesty to tell the Grand Jury, from the bench, that <Q>the criminal law of <HI>this State</HI> is so pregnant with <HI>justice,</HI> so agree∣able to <HI>reason,</HI> so full of <HI>equity</HI> and <HI>clemency,</HI> that even those who suffer by it, <HI>cannot charge it with rigour</HI></Q>!!!—This was too much. He might, at any rate, have spared us the mortifica∣tion of listening to this. But, it is the fashion. Almost every public harrangue has some such vaunting conclusion. It may be good policy, to be sure, as it tends, to keep the people here in excellent humour, while it excites envy in those
<PB N="101" REF="033523_0098_0FF7744026FE96F8"/>
of ther nations, makes them discontented whit their lot, and invites them to cultivate the deserts of America; but then, the greatest care imagin∣able should be taken, not to lay the iron finger on such men as are not formed for passive suf∣france, and particularly if they are Britons; for they, above all others, will not whisper their curses to the winds: they will turn their eyes towards their native land: they will compare what they have lost with what they have gained; nor will all the terrors of hard labour and a Phi∣ladelphia dungeon, ever, I trust, deter them from proclaiming the account to the world.</P>
<P>I have now accomplished my object. I have exposed the conduct of my enemies, and I have amply proved, that the press is more free in Great Britain than it is in America. As to the motives by which I have been actuated, though I frankly confess, that had I not been injured, had I not been singled out as an object of legal vengeance, no part of this pamphlet would ever have been written or thought of; yet, I am far from wishing to throw an odium on the people of these States in general, and to represent them as a tame degenerate race of mortals. On the contrary, I know that a very great majority of them have felt, and expressed, the utmost indig∣nation at the treatment I have received. The decision of the Grand Jury alone, considering the charge that was made to them, is sufficient to prove, that the spirit of true liberty is yet alive on this side the Atlantic. That decision, and the joy which it excited amongst all the respectable inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia, are fresh in every one's memory, and will, I am sure, be
<PB N="102" REF="033523_0099_0FF77441AFFF1048"/>
for ever rivetted in mine. Let it not be suppo∣sed, however, that I say this with the base motive of procuring or preserving <HI>patronage,</HI> either pub∣lic or private. I stand in need of none. My good honest parents taught me the labours of the field, and, with these, they taught me independ∣ence of mind. It has pleased God to bless me with health, and with limbs to gain my bread; and, while I am able to do this by the spade or the plough, I will never seek for wealth nor for ease, by fawning for popular favour, or by bu∣rying my injuries in silent submission.</P>
