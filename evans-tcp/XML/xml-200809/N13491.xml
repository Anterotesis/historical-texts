<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE the honor to inform Congress, that I arrived here yesterday about twelve o'clock, on my return from Hartford. Some hours previous to my arrival Major Ge∣neral Arnold went from his quarters, which were this place, and, as it was supposed, over the river to the garrison at West Point, whither I proceeded myself, in order to visit the post. I found General Arnold had not been there during the day, and on my return to his quarters he was still absent. In the mean time, a packet had arrived from Lieut. Colonel Jameson, announcing the capture of a John Anderson, who was endeavouring to go to New-York with several interesting and important papers, all in the hand writing of General Arnold. This was also accom∣panied with a letter from the prisoner, avowing himself to be Major John André, Adjutant General to the British army, relating the manner of his capture, and endeavour∣ing to shew that he did not come under the description of a <HI>spy.</HI> From these several circumstances, and informa∣tion that the General seemed to be thrown into some de∣gree of agitation, on receiving a letter a little time before he went from his quarters, I was led to conclude imme∣diately that he had heard of Major André's captivity, and that he would, if possible, escape to the enemy, and accord∣ingly took such measures as appeared the most probable to apprehend him. But he had embarked in a barge and proceeded down the river, under a flag, to the Vulture
<PB N="4" REF="017043_0004_0FA25CDCA5DA1810" MS="y"/>
ship of war, which lay at some miles below Stoney and Verplank's Points. He wrote me a letter after he got on board. Major André is not arrived yet, but I hope he is secure, and that he will be here to-day. I have been and am taking precautions, which I trust will prove effectual to prevent the important consequences which this conduct, on the part of General Arnold, was intended to produce. I do not know the party that took Major André, but it is said that it consisted only of a few militia, who acted in such a manner upon the occasion, as does them the highest honor, and proves them to be men of great virtue. As soon as I know their names, I shall take pleasure in trans∣mitting them to Congress.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Major André, Adjutant General to the British army, will be brought before you for your examination. He came within our lines in the night, on an interview with Major General Arnold, and in an assumed charac∣ter; and was taken within our lines, in a disguised ha∣bit, with a pass under a feigned name, and with the inclosed papers concealed upon him. After a careful

examination, you will be pleased, as speedily as possi∣ble, to report a precise state of his case, together with your opinion of the light in which he ought to be con∣sidered, and the punishment that ought to be inflicted. The Judge Advocate will attend to assist in the exami∣nation, who has sundry other papers relative to this matter, which he will lay before the Board.</P>

<P>The names of the officers composing the Board were read to Major André, and on his being asked whether he confessed the matters contained in the letter from his Ex∣cellency General Washington to the Board, or denied them, <HI>he said, in addition to his letter to General Washington, dated Salem, the</HI> 24th <HI>September,</HI> 1780. (which was read to the board, and acknowledged by Major André, to have been written by him, which letter is as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Salem, <DATE>24th Sept. 1780.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>What I have as yet said concerning myself, was in the justifiable attempt to be extricated; I am too little accus∣tomed to duplicity to have succeeded.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I beg your Excellency will be persuaded, that no alter∣ation in the temper of my mind, or apprehension for my safety, induces me to take the step of addressing you, but that it is to secure myself from an imputation of having assumed a mean character for treacherous purposes or self interest. A conduct incompatible with the principles that actuated me, as well as with my condition in life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is to vindicate my fame that I speak and not to so∣licit security.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The person in your possession is Major John Andre, Adjutant General to the British army.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The influence of one commander in the army of his adversary is an advantage taken in war. A correspon∣dence for this purpose I held; as confidential (in the pre∣sent instance) with his Excellency Sir Henry Clinton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To favour it, I agreed to meet upon ground not within posts of either army, a person who was to give me intelligence; I came up in the Vulture man of war
<PB N="19" REF="017043_0007_0FA25CDFA73A82D0"/>
for this effect, and was fetched by a boat from the shore to the beach: Being there I was told that the approach of day would prevent my return, and that I must be concealed until the next night. I was in my regimentals and had fairly risked my person.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Against my stipulation, my intention and without, my knowledge before hand, I was conducted within one of your posts. Your Excellency may conceive my sensation on this occasion and will imagine how much more I must have been affected, by a refusal to reconduct me back the next night as I had been brought. Thus become a prisoner I had to concert my escape.</HI> I quitted my uni∣form <HI>and was passed another way in the night without the American posts to neutral ground, and informed I was beyond all armed parties and left to press for New-York. I was taken at Tarry Town by some volanteers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thus as I have had the honor to relate was I betrayed (being Adjutant General of the British army) into the vile condition of an enemy in disguise within your posts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Having avowed myself a British officer I have nothing to reveal but what relates to myself, which is true on the honour of an officer and a gentleman.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The request I have to make your Excellency, and I am conscious I address myself well, is, that in any rigour policy may dictate, a decency of conduct towards me may mark, that though unfortunate I am branded with no∣thing dishonourable, as no motive could be mine but the service of my king, and as I was involuntarily an impostor.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Another request is, that I may be permitted to write an open letter to Sir Henry Clinton and another to a friend for cloaths and linen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I take the liberty to mention the condition of some gentlemen at Charles-Town, who being either on parole or under protection, were engaged in a conspiracy against us. Though their situation is not similar, they are objects who may be set in exchange for me, or are persons whom the treatment I receive might affect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It is no less, Sir, in a confidence in the generosity of your mind, than on account of your superior station that I have chosen to importune you with this letter.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honour to be, with great respect, Sir, Your Excellency's most obedient and most humble servant, JOHN ANDRE, Adjutant General.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

He also said, that when he left the Vulture sloop of war, it was understood he was to return that night; but it was then doubted, and if he could not return he was promised to be <HI>concealed on</HI> shore in a place of safety, until the next <HI>night,</HI> when he was to return in the same man∣ner he came on shore; and when the next day came he was solicitous to get back, and made enquiries in the course of the day, how he should return, when he was informed he could not return that way and he must take the rout he did afterwards. He also said, That the first notice he had of his being within any <HI>of our posts,</HI> was, being chal∣lenged by the sentry, which was the first night he was on shore. He also said, that the evening of the twenty-second of September instant, he passed <HI>King's Ferry be∣tween our posts of Stoney and Verplank's Points,</HI> in the <HI>dress he is at present in, and which he said was not his regimen∣tals,</HI> and which dress he procured, after he landed from the Vulture and when he was within <HI>our posts,</HI> and that he was proceeding to New-York, but was taken on his way at Tarry Town, as he has mentioned in his letter, on Sa∣turday the twenty-third of September instant, about nine o'clock in the morning.</P>

<P><PB N="10" REF="017043_0010_0FA25CE1DD7AFF40"/>Major Andrè observed that this letter could be of no force in the case in question, as it was written in New-York, when he was under the orders of General Clinton, but that it tended to prove that it was not his intention to come within our lines.</P>
<P>The Board having interrogated Major Andrè about his conception of his coming on shore under the sanction of a flag, <HI>he said, That it was impossible for him to suppose he came on shore under that sanction;</HI> and added, That if he came on shore under that sanction, he certainly might have returned under it.</P>
<P>Major Andrè having acknowledged the preceding facts, and being asked whether he had any thing to say respecting them, answered, He left them to operate with the Board.</P>
<P>The examination of Major Andrè being concluded, he was remanded into custody.</P>
<P>The following letters were laid before the Board, and read:—Benedict Arnold's letter to General Washing∣ton, dated September 25, 1780. Col.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE heart which is conscious of its own rectitude, cannot attempt to palliate a step which the world may cen∣sure as wrong; I have ever acted from a principle of love to my country, since the commencement of the present unhappy contest between Great-Britain and the Colonies; the same principle of love to my country actuates my present conduct, however it may appear inconsistent to the world, who very seldom judge right of any man's actions.</P>
<P>I have no favour to ask for myself. I have too often experienced the ingratitude of my country to attempt it; but from the known humanity of your Excellence, I am induced to ask your protection for Mrs. Arnold, from every insult and injury that the mistaken vengeance of my country may expose her to. It ought to fall only on me; she is as good and as innocent as an angel, and is incapable of doing wrong. I beg she may be permitted to return to her friends in Philadelphia, or to come to me as she may choose; from your Excellency I have no fears

<P>I AM this moment injormed that Major Andrè, Adjutant General of his Majesty's army in America, is detained as a prisoner, by the army under your command. It is therefore incumbent on me to inform you of the manner of his falling into your hands: He went up with a flag at the request of General Arnold, on public business with him, and had his permit to return by land to New-York: Under these circumstances Major Andrè cannot be detained by you, without the greatest violation of flags, and contrary to the custom and usage of all nations; and as I imagine you will see this matter in the same point of view as I do, I must desire you will order him to be set at liberty and allowed to return immediately: Every step Major Andrè took was by the advice and direction of Ge∣neral Arnold, even that of taking a feigned name, and of course not liable to censure for it.</P>

This officer cannot therefore fail of being immediately sent to New-York, as he was invited to a conversation with me, for which I sent him a flag of truce, and finally gave him passports for his safe return to your Excellency; all which I had then a right to do, being in the actual service of America, under the orders of Gene∣ral

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Excellency is doubtless already apprised of the manner in which I was taken, and possibly of the serious light in which my conduct is considered, and the rigorous determination that is impending.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances, I have obtained General Washington's permission to send you this letter; the object of which is, to remove from your breast any sus∣picion, that I could imagine I was bound by your Ex∣cellency's orders to expose myself to what has happened. The events of coming within an enemy's posts, and of changing my dress, which led me to my present situati∣on, were contrary to my own intentions, as they were to your orders; and the circuitous route, which I took to return, was imposed (perhaps unavoidably) without alternative upon me.</P>
<P>I am perfectly tranquil in mind, and prepared for any fate, to which an honest zeal for my King's service may have devoted me.</P>
<P>In addressing myself to your Excellency on this occa∣sion, the force of all my obligations to you, and of the attachment and gratitude I bear you, recurs to me. With all the warmth of my heart, I give you thanks for your Excellency's profuse kindness to me; and I send you the most earnest wishes for your welfare, which a faith∣ful, affectionate, and respectful attendant can frame.</P>
<P>I have a mother and three sisters, to whom the value of my commission would be an object, as the loss of Grenada has much affected their income. It is needless to be more explicit on this subject; I am persuaded of your Excellency's goodness.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="017043_0015_0FA25CE966EC4390"/>I receive the greatest attention from his Excellency General Washington, and from every person, under whose charge I happen to be placed.</P>

<P>IN answer to your Excellency's letter of the 26th instant, which I had the honour to receive, I am to in∣form you, that Major André was taken under such cir∣cumstances as would have justified the most summary proceedings against him. I determined, however, to re∣fer his case to the examination and decision of a Board of General Officers, who have reported, on his free and voluntary confession and letters,—"That he came on shore from the Vulture sloop of war in the night of the twenty-first of September instant," &amp;c. &amp;c. as in the report of the Board of General Officers.</P>
<P>From these proceedings it is evident Major André was employed in the execution of measures very foreign to the objects of flags of truce, and such as they were ne∣ver meant to authorise or countenance in the most distant degree; and this gentleman confessed, with the greatest candor, in the course of his examination, "That it was impossible for him to suppose he came on shore, under the sanction of a flag."</P>

<P>PERSUADED that you are inclined rather to pro∣mote than prevent the civilities and acts of humanity, which the rules of war permit between civilized nations, I find no difficulty in representing to you, that several letters and messages sent from hence have been disregard∣ed, are unanswered, and the flags of truce that carried them, detained. As I ever have treated all flags of truce with civility and respect, I have a right to hope, that you will order my complaint to be immediately redressed.</P>
<P>Major André, who visited an officer commanding in a district at his own desire, and acted in every circumstance agreeable to his direction, I find is detained a prisoner; my friendship for him leads me to fear he may suffer some inconvenience for want of necessaries; I wish to be al∣lowed to send him a few, and shall take it as a favour if you will be pleased to permit his servant to deliver them. In Sir Henry Clinton's absence it becomes a part of my duty to make this representation and request.</P>

<P>FROM your Excellency's letter of this date, I am persuaded the Board of General Officers, to whom you referred the case of Major André, can't have been rightly informed of all the circumstances on which a judgment ought to be formed. I think it of the highest moment to humanity, that your Excellency should be perfectly apprized of the state of this matter, before you proceed to put that judgment in execution.</P>
<P>For this reason, I shall send His Excellency Lieut. Ge∣neral Robertson, and two other gentlemen, to give you a true state of facts, and to declare to you my sentiments and resolutions. They will set out to-morrow as early as the wind and tide will permit, and wait near Dobbs's ferry for your permission and safe conduct, to meet your Excellency, or such persons as you may appoint, to converse with them on this subject.</P>

<P>Lieut. General Robertson, Mr. Elliot, and Mr. Smith came up in a flag vessel to Dobb's ferry, agreeable to the above letter. The two last were not suffered to land. General Robertson was permitted to come on shore, and was met by Major General Greene, who verbally re∣ported that General Robertson mentioned to him in sub∣stance what is contained in his letter of the 2d of Octo∣ber to General Washington.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A NOTE I have from General Greene, leaves me in doubt if his memory had served him, to relate to you with exactness the substance of the conversation that had passed between him and myself, on the subject of Major Andrè. In an affair of so much consequence to my friend, to the two armies, and humanity, I would leave no possibility of a misunderstanding, and therefore take the liberty to put in writing the substance of what I said to General Greene.</P>
<P>I offered to prove, by the evidence of Colonel Robin∣son and the officers of the Vulture, that Major André went on shore at General Arnold's desire, in a boat sent for him with a flag of truce; that he not only came ashore with the knowledge and under the protection of the General who commanded in the district, but that he took no step while on shore but by direction of General Arnold, as will appear by the inclosed letter from him to your Excellency.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances I could not, and hoped you would not, consider Major André as a spy, for any im∣proper phrase in his letter to you.</P>
<P>The facts he relates correspond with the evidence I offer; but he admits a conclusion that does not follow. The change of cloaths and name was ordered by General Arnold, under whose direction he necessarily was, while within his command. As General Greene and I did not agree in opinion, I wished, that disinterested gentlemen of knowledge of the law of war and nations, might be asked their opinion on the subject; and mentioned Mon∣sieur Knyphausen, and General Rochambault.</P>
<P>I related that a Captain Robinson had been delivered to Sir Henry Clinton as a spy, and undoubtedly was such; but that it being signified to him that you were desirous
<PB N="19" REF="017043_0019_0FA25CF01B36CFE8"/>
that this man should be exchanged, he had ordered him to be exchanged.</P>
<P>I wished that an intercourse of such civilities, as the rules of war admit of, might take off many of its horrors. I admitted that Major André had a great share of Sir Henry Clinton's esteem, and that he would be infinitely obliged by his liberation; and that if he was permitted to return with me, I would engage to have any person you would be pleased to name set at liberty.</P>
<P>I added, that Sir Henry Clinton had never put to death any person for a breach of the rules of war, though he had, and now has, many in his power. Under the present circumstances, much good may arise from hu∣manity, much ill from the want of it. If that could give any weight, I beg leave to add, that your favourable treatment of Major André, will be a favour I should ever be intent to return to any you hold dear.</P>
<P>My memory does not retain with the exactness I could wish, the words of the letter which General Greene shewed me from Major Andrè to your Excellency. For Sir Henry Clinton's satisfaction, I beg you will order a copy of it to be sent to me at New-York.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE polite attention shewn by your Excellency and the Gentlemen of your family to Mrs. Arnold, when in distress, demand my grateful acknowledgment and thanks, which I beg leave to present.</P>
<P>From your Excellency's letter to Sir Henry Clinton, I find a Board of General Officers have given it as their opinion, that Major André comes under the description of a spy: My good opinion of the candor and justice of those Gentlemen leads me to believe, that if they had been made fully acquainted with every circumstance re∣specting Major André, that they would by no means have considered him in the light of a spy, or even of a pri∣soner. In justice to him, I think it my duty to declare, that he came from on board the Vulture at my particular request, by a flag sent on purpose for him by Joshua Smith, Esq. who had permission to go to Dobbs's ferry to carry letters, and for other purposes not mentioned,
<PB N="20" REF="017043_0020_0FA25CF024C78ED0"/>
and to return. This was done as a blind to the spy boats: Mr. Smith at the same time had my private directions to go on board the Vulture, and bring on shore Col. Robin∣son, or Mr. John Anderson, which was the name I had requested Major André to assume: At the same time I desired Mr. Smith to inform him, that he should have my protection, and a safe passport to return in the same boat, as soon as our business was compleated. As several acci∣dents intervened to prevent his being sent on board, I gave him my passport to return by land. Major Andrè came on shore in his uniform (without disguise) which with much reluctance, at my particular and pressing instance, he ex∣changed for another coat. I furnished him with a horse and saddle, and pointed out the route by which he was to return. And as commanding officer in the department, I had an undoubted right to transact all these matters; which, if wrong, Major André ought by no means to suffer for them.</P>
<P>But if, after this just and candid representation of Major André's case, the Board of General Officers adhere to their former opinion, I shall suppose it dictated by passion and resentment; and if that Gentleman should suffer the severity of their sentence, I shall think myself bound by every tie of duty and honour, to retaliate on such unhappy persons of your army, as may fall within my power, that the respect due to flags, and to the law of nations, may be better understood and observed.</P>
<P>I have further to observe, that forty of the principal inhabitants of South-Carolina have justly forfeited their lives, which have hitherto been spared by the clemency of His Excellency Sir Henry Clinton, who cannot in justice extend his mercy to them any longer, if Major André suffers; which in all probability will open a scene of blood at which humanity will revolt.</P>
<P>Suffer me to intreat your Excellency, for your own and the honour of humanity, and the love you have of justice, that you suffer not an unjust sentence to touch the life of Major André.</P>
<P>But if this warning should be disregarded, and he suf∣fer, I call heaven and earth to witness, that your Ex∣cellency will be justly answerable for the torrent of blood that may be spilt in consequence.</P>

<P>BUOY'D above the terror of death, by the consci∣ousness of a life devoted to honourable pursuits, and stained with no action that can give me remorse, I trust that the request I make to your Excellency at this serious period, and which is to soften my last moments, will not be re∣jected.</P>
<P>Sympathy towards a soldier will surely induce your Ex∣cellency and a military tribunal to adopt the mode of my death to the feelings of a man of honour.</P>
<P>Let me hope, Sir, that if ought in my character im∣presses you with esteem towards me, if ought in my mis∣fortunes marks me as the victim of policy and not of re∣sentment, I shall experience the operation of these feelings in your breast, by being informed that I am not to die on a gibbet.</P>
