<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>MATTHEW, XII. 43, 44, 45.</BIBL>
<P>When the unclean Spirit is gone out of the man, he walketh through dry places seeking rest, and findeth none.—Then he saith, I will re∣turn into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.—Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this chapter, we have an account of a blind and deaf Devil being cast out of a man, by our Saviour: upon which, the people were greatly amazed, and cried —is not this the son of David?—The Scribes and Pharisees, seeing their wealth and reputation at stake, suffered their ma∣lice to cast Reason out of its seat; and bold∣ly
<PB N="6" REF="024115_0004_0FC3A4FF1DF34C20"/>
accused Christ of casting out Devils by Beelzebub, the Prince of the Devils. This assertion, was such a palpable contradic∣tion in its nature, that it needed no refut∣ation. He only observed, by way of re∣proof, that as the house, or kingdom, di∣vided against itself could not stand; so Sa∣tan, if divided, could not stand.</P>
<P>Nothing short of the Spirit of God, can cast out Satan; as they acknowledged in the exorcises of their sons: hence says Christ, they shall be your judges. But if I cast out Devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.</P>
<P>The casting out of Devils, argued supe∣rior power, and divine authority. Conse∣quently, the imputation of that power to Beelzebub, involved them in the predica∣ment of blasphemy; which occasioned Christ to close his reproof, by observing, that whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</P>
<P>Instead of accepting this reproof, and returning to right reason, they violently cast off conviction, and demanded a sign. They denied credit to the miracles he had
<PB N="7" REF="024115_0005_0FC3A50699472D18"/>
wrought; unless he would submit to prove them divine, by another miracle, according to their prescription: and his refusal, they made the ground, or pretence, of final re∣jection.</P>
<P>This was such a flagrant act of spite and malice against Christ, and his works, that he called them a generation of vipers; re∣minded them of a day of judgment, and certain condemnation. And finally, in the words of our text, characterised their vile temper of mind; their restless and fruitless search of rest against light; and their mise∣rable end.</P>
<P><HI>When the unclean Spirit is gone out of the man, he walketh through dry places seeking rest, and findeth none. Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.</HI></P>
<P>Whether we consider these words as plain and direct matter of fact, in the cavilling Scribes and Pharisees; or as a mere para∣ble, directly applied to them, will be of
<PB N="8" REF="024115_0006_0FC3A50815AE52D0"/>
no material consequence. They are doubt∣less a description of the unpardonable sin, with the several steps leading thereto, and deplorable consequence: and as such, de∣mand our most solemn attention.</P>
<P>My design is, to consider these words in an explanitory manner, and then apply them:—Therefore,</P>
<P>Firstly, Let us enquire what this un∣clean Spirit is, and how it goes out of the man.—Whether we consider these words as a parable, or otherwise; they must refer to that wicked disposition, with which these Scribes and Pharisees went out against Christ. It is not the Devil, but the tem∣per and conduct of the man, which is here condemned. That <HI>unclean Spirit,</HI> is used here in opposition to moral purity; to a pure and upright heart. It implies a heart wickedly and perversely set against the truth.</P>
<P>In this sense, the Jews had accused Christ of having an <HI>unclean Spirit</HI>; because he cast out Devils, and condemned their tra∣ditions. So again, Paul calls that spirit of strife and dissention, with which many went out against Christ, a witchcraft— Galat. 3.4. In like manner, Christ com∣pares these very Scribes and Pharisees,
<PB N="9" REF="024115_0007_0FC3A50997C61AF8"/>
to <HI>whited sepulchres, full of all uncleanness:</HI> because they appeared outwardly righteous unto men; but inwardly, <HI>were full of hy∣pocrisy and iniquity</HI>—Math. 23: 27. Thus, the <HI>unclean Spirit,</HI> is a temper of wilful re∣sistance, and stubborn perverseness, against the light of evidence and good conscience. And such, in fact, was the case of the Jews: to whom these words were applied, as I shall shew further on.</P>
<P>Now, this unclean Spirit goes out of the man, whenever he, in words or actions, opposes Christ, the doctrines of the gospel, or the influences of the Spirit of God: he then <HI>scattereth abroad.</HI> Hence Christ, when he reproves the Pharisees for rejecting him, and perversely adhereing to the doctrines and traditions of men, says, <HI>hear and un∣derstand: not that which goeth into the mouth, defileth a man: but that which cometh out of the mouth defileth a man, such as evil thoughts, adulteries, murders, thefts, covetousness, wick∣edness, deceit, debate, blasphemy, pride, fool∣ishness.</HI> And to persons of these characters, he says, <HI>ye are of your father the Devil, and his works ye will do.</HI> These are not the work of the Spirit of God, but of the flesh: they proceed from an impure heart, and defiled conscience: they despise Christ, and resist the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="024115_0008_0FC3A50B1BE03EE8"/>Thus, the unclean Spirit goes out of the man, when he purposely opposes the gospel of Christ: especially so, when, a∣gainst light, he denies the divinity of Christ, the gospel revelation, and method of sal∣vation: or, when he broaches doctrines, which render the death of Christ of non ef∣fect, and the influences of the Spirit, a mere delusion; imputing the works of the Spirit of God, unto Beelzebub, the Prince of the Devils.—This leads me,</P>
<P>Secondly, To consider the effects of this going out of the Spirit, viz:—<HI>He walketh through dry places seeking rest, and findeth none.</HI></P>
<P>It is observable, that the man, having set out against Christ, and his way of salva∣tion, can have no assistance from the Spi∣rit of God, or a revelation: but he trusts to his own beclouded reason, against infi∣nite wisdom. Therefore, like a man seek∣ing sustenance, in a dry and thirsty desert, he will be constantly disappointed. Hu∣man reason, cannot obtain peace against God: there is no rest, in an opposition to the author and giver of rest.</P>
<P>The conduct of the Scribes and Phari∣sees, to whom these words were applied, will be our best example. They, as Rulers
<PB N="11" REF="024115_0009_0FC3A50C93561A90"/>
and Teachers in Israel, had, for a long time, acquired great esteem and respect. And, by their adherence to the ceremonial law, and traditions of the fathers, which they strenuously inculcated on the people, they supported their pride and enriched their pockets. Therefore, so soon as Christ de∣clared his mission, and reproved them of self-righteousness and neglect of the moral law, they cried out against him;—that he was a babler, a wine-bibber, impostor and friend of publicans and sinners. They did every thing in their power, to irritate the minds of the people, and cast contempt on Christ; well knowing, that his increase, would be their decrease: for he constantly opposed, and openly rebuked them out of the law of God. Therefore, so far as the peo∣ple received Christ, so far their self righte∣ousness and traditional religion would fall.</P>
<P>This excited them to make a further at∣tempt for rest. They now denied that Christ had fulfiled the prophesies concern∣ing the Messiah. But this deceived their hope, as defamation had done before. The people were divided. Some cried that a great Prophet had arisen among them: others, that he deceived the people. In∣stead of rest, they found confusion and disappointment. And in addition to their
<PB N="12" REF="024115_0010_0FC3A50E848326C0"/>
anxiety, Christ produced infallible evi∣dence of his divine mission. He wrought miracles publicly, tending to the glory of God, and good of man: and <HI>these,</HI> unat∣tended with art and juggling. By a word, he restored a withered hand: by a voice, he raised the dead: and by authoritive command, he cast out a blind and dumb Devil. At this the people were amazed, and said—<HI>is not this the son of David?</HI> They acknowledged him the Messiah, the seed of David, prophesied of.</P>
<P>The Scribes and Pharisees were now more offended than ever: ye see, said they, how we gain nothing, the world has gone out after him. Their religion, riches and honor, were at stake; and must necessarily give place to the reception given to Christ. Therefore, although they acknowledged the power of God, in casting out Devils, by their sons; yet they disallowed it in Christ; and arose as one man, and came forward among the people, crying—<HI>This fellow doth not cast out Devils, but by Beel∣zebub the Prince of the Devils.</HI></P>
<P>Here they seek rest, but find none. This is such a bare-faced piece of spite and ma∣lice, that Christ calls them a generation of vipers. Reason, was cast off her seat: and they were conedmned out of their own
<PB N="13" REF="024115_0011_0FC3A514CA55CC38"/>
mouths. <HI>If an house or kingdom be divided against itself, how can it stand? If Satan be divided, how shall his kingdom stand?</HI>—They first, denied the operations of the Spirit of God; and then asserted impossibilities to support it.</P>
<P>This drove them into another barren place for rest; they next, carved out for God: <HI>Master, we would see a sign from thee.</HI> They required him to work another mira∣cle, by their prescription, to prove those divine. He positively denied them. For, if they would not believe in miracles, wrought in God's way, neither would they, if wrought in their own way. And the dignity of the divine perfections, forbid the working of miracles at human direction; or, for the gratification of caviling and ma∣licious spirits. This left them, seeking rest and finding none. Thus, our text ap∣pears to be direct matter of fact; as ap∣plied to the spiteful temper, and malicious conduct of the Scribes and Pharisees.</P>
<P>And indeed, this is the case with all men, who go out against Christ, and his gospel: they are like a troubled sea, never at rest. The light of reason and conscience, conti∣nually disturb their resting places: they fear their own reasoning; but are too wil∣ful to attend to the checks of conscience,
<PB N="14" REF="024115_0012_0FC3A51984ACB760"/>
and the evidence of revelation. Hence, they are always busy after rest; but to no good purpose; except, to greater conviction and more disappointment.</P>
<P>Such is the state of those, who deny the being of a God: <HI>for the invisible things of God are clearly understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead</HI>; so that the very heathen are without ex∣cuse, for not glorifying him as God. Here the atheist seeks rest against the works of creation and Providence, and consequent∣ly, in dry places.</P>
<P>The deist also, who denies the divinity of Christ, and of his gospel, must oppose sound reason and conscience; must run against the fulfilment of the prophesies, and miracles, wrought evidently by the power of God; and these, attested by the enemies of Christ, and sealed by the blood of his friends.</P>
<P>This class of rest-seekers, arise out of loose and profane characters; who, to ob∣tain rest against conscience, make partial interpretation of scripture; and conse∣quently partial denial of God's word. But certainly they may as well deny the whole, as a part. The absurdity of a partial de∣nial, is so obvious, that they soon cast off
<PB N="15" REF="024115_0013_0FC3A51ADA0B3898"/>
fear, deny, the whole, and commence deists in full.</P>
<P>Human reason, unassisted by revelation or the influences of the Spirit of God, is now their only guide. <HI>That reason,</HI> which at best, can only convince us that we have lost the rectitude of our nature, are under the displeasure of God, and unable of our∣selves to return to our duty: <HI>that reason,</HI> which is but an imperfect guide in any of our worldly concerns: I say, <HI>that reason</HI> is all they can bring against infinite wisdom, and those evidences, which have obliged them to retreat step by step into the barren fields of carnal wisdom.</P>
<P>They can now, only carve out for God. Carnal reason says, the scripture, with all the fulfilment of prophesies, miracles wrought, and attested by credible history, is no sufficient evidence of the divinity of Christ. Therefore (like the Jews in the same case of inconsistency) they say, <HI>Master, we would see a sign from thee.</HI> They deny credit to the gospel; unless God will con∣descend to prove those prophesies and mi∣racles, true; and those witnesses, who seal-the truth with their blood, true witnesses, according to their prescribing. But it is observable, that such condescension is be∣low the dignity of God. <HI>No sign shall be
<PB N="16" REF="024115_0014_0FC3A51C5A610188"/>
given,</HI> says Christ. Those given were suf∣ficient: if they receive not those given in God's way, neither would they though gi∣ven in their own way. <HI>If they believe not Moses and the prophets, neither would they be∣lieve, though one arose from the dead.</HI></P>
<P>Such persons are in the most alarming situation: they stand upon the brink of hell: one step further in this way after rest, will be irrecoverable. If they (like the Jews) make God's refusal to gratify their cavilling, the ground of resolute and continued rejection, of the gospel evidence; they may probably remain here, until the great day of account. Such grounded re∣jection, effectually bars the door against any further conviction; and consequently, damnation must follow.</P>
<P>To this, doubtless, Christ had a parti∣cular reference in the words before us. It was the precise case of the Scribes and Pha∣risees, to whom they were spoken. And we have reason to fear, it is the case of ma∣ny of this day; who are going out against Christ, in the boast of their own reason: they walk through dry places, seeking rest and finding none.</P>
<P>And indeed, it is observable, that such is the case of every person in some degree,
<PB N="17" REF="024115_0015_0FC3A51DCEAFF6C8"/>
while under spiritual illumination and conviction. The carnal mind and Satan, will cast every possible objection, in the way of believing: hence, various turnings after a quiet conscience; but no seeking rest, against light of evidence and consci∣ence, can give peace in the way or salva∣tion in the end.</P>
<P>Hence we see, that a man may go far against Christ, with an unclean spirit: and yet find no rest to his soul.—This leads us to consider the effect of this fruitless search, or the nature of the man's resolve, viz:</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>I will return into my house from whence I came out.</HI></P>
<P>Here we note, that all who walk through dry places seeking rest, do not come to this last resolve. Many, who have been under great spiritual alarms, and resisted for a long time, have finally seen their error, repented, and received the truth in the love of it.</P>
<P>Christ is here shewing the state of the infidel Jews, who rejected him wilfully, against clear light and strong evidence. We must therefore consider the man as coming to this last desperate resolve; <HI>I will return to my house, from whence I came out.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="024115_0016_0FC3A51F6CD6E5A8"/>Two things are here worthy of consider∣ation, viz. The nature of this resolve, and the matter or end resolved upon.</P>
<P>With regard to the nature of this re∣solve, it is observable, that it is a fixed and settled determination, without any proviso, limitation or condition. He does not pro∣pose to wait longer, or seek further; he does not desire more light; but is satisfied: and his resolve is emphatically decisive—<HI>I will return.</HI> I will seek no further: I will weary myself no more in this perplexing search after rest: it is all a delusion, the work of an unclean spirit—<HI>By Beelzebub he casteth out devils.</HI> The resolve is wilful and obstinate: he acts not the part of a wise man, who embraces the truth, because the evidence is too strong for him: but finding light and evidence too strong, he resolves to fly from it: his works are works of darkness, and will not bear the light. He knowingly and wilfully flies from his con∣viction; rejects the fulfilment of prophe∣sies; denies miracles wrought by the Spirit of God: and <HI>these,</HI> acknowledged fact, by the enemies of the gospel; and sealed by the blood of its friends. Thus the Jews, tho' they could not deny fact; yet wilfully cast off their convictions, and demanded a sign, hoping to pacify their own conscien∣ces,
<PB N="19" REF="024115_0017_0FC3A520F7BA8678"/>
and blind the eyes of the people. Hence Christ says, <HI>ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of Hell.</HI></P>
<P>This wilful resolve effectually bars the door against any further operations of the Spirit of God. The man dies in obstinacy: not for want of mercy in God, or merit in Christ: but by denying the Spirit of God, he shuts the door against any reception of a spirit of conviction. And God has said, that such despite towards the Spirit of his grace; <HI>shall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</HI></P>
<P>This resolve is no rash, inconsiderate act, without time to reflect; but it is after go∣ing thro' dry places, seeking rest and find∣ing none: after repeated warnings and in∣vitations; and after sufficient and reason∣able evidence of the truth. Therefore, the resolve is wilful and deliberate, mature and decisive, against the light of conscience, re∣velation, and the influences of the Spirit.</P>
<P>The matter resolved on is, that he will go back, <HI>into his house from whence he came out.</HI></P>
<P>In order to know what this house is, we must enquire from whence the man set out, viz. from a state of a carnal rest and secu∣rity.
<PB N="20" REF="024115_0018_0FC3A5225B437A18"/>
A man before conviction, feels very easy and secure: this is the state, or house, of every unawakened sinner; for Satan takes care to keep it unmolested, until drove out by the power of God. Hence our Saviour says, <HI>when a strong man, armed, keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace. But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.</HI> The man is at rest, while under the darkness of the carnal heart, and Sa∣tan's influences: but when Christ comes upon him, being the stronger man, his peace is destroyed. And he goes out against Christ, with a carnal mind, assisted by Sa∣tan; which makes it an unclean spirit, walking through dry places, seeking rest and finding none. And at length, rather than submit to the light of evidence, and conviction of conscience, he violently and wilfully casts off all restraint, and returns like the dog to his vomit: He goes back to his house, or state of carnal rest, from whence he came out.</P>
<P>He says, all this alarm and fear is con∣trary to reason and common sense: a piece of priest-craft to blind mankind: a mere enthusiasm, and delusion of the Devil. All the influences of the spirit of God, he
<PB N="21" REF="024115_0019_0FC3A52911BCF848"/>
imputes to Beelzebub, the Prince of De∣vils: and embraces his influences and dic∣tates, as congenial to his own perverse rea∣son and carnal heart. He is determined, no longer to be a slave to this uneasy mind: therefore, violently shuts his eyes, against the evidence of the gospel, and influences of the spirit of God. Thus, the man falls asleep in spiritual death: the way is no longer open to conviction: he can have nothing of a spiritual nature to disturb his conscience; and God forbids us even to pray for him. The Devil smiles; his palace and his goods are again in peace: and for his own sake, he will take care that all things are agreeable to the man's state of carnal security, for the better deluding others into this state of final and irrecover∣able ruin.—This leads,</P>
<P>Fourthly, To consider the preparations made in this house, for the return of this unclean spirit:—<HI>And when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.</HI></P>
<P>This heart, or house of carnal rest, he finds <HI>empty:</HI> it has been left for a season, while he has been wandering through dry places, seeking rest and finding none. Christ, by his Spirit, had disturbed the strong man's palace: his goods had been greatly discomforted; the spirit of Christ
<PB N="22" REF="024115_0020_0FC3A52AA19B0700"/>
always makes the carnal heart, the devil's kingdom, fear and tremble. Hence he went out against Christ with pride and ma∣lice; and spitefully resolved against him.</P>
<P>But this state or house is now emphati∣cally <HI>empty</HI> of the Spirit of God. The man imputes all the influences and strivings of the holy Spirit, unto Beelzebub; and thus shuts the door against himself: there is no room left for further conviction. That this house becomes empty of the means of grace, as such: they operate on him direct∣ly the reverse; they drive him further from God. Thus the house is empty of all good; just fit for himself, or a blasphemer of the Holy Ghost, and determined servant of Satan.</P>
<P>This house is also <HI>swept.</HI> This implies, a total absence of all spiritual things; they are as swept out; there are no remains of the Spirit's operations; but his conscience is as scared with an hot iron. It cannot feel the power of spiritual things; he ac∣counts them as dross and dung; as delu∣sion, and enthusiasm of the Devil. He has no feelings or conceptions of spiritual things: but God has said of him, he is joined unto idols, let him alone. Thus he not only denies the Holy Ghost; but God leaves him to the delusion of his own heart, and his gods.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="024115_0021_0FC3A52CE9AC51D8"/>Again, This house is not only <HI>empty</HI> and <HI>swept</HI>; but <HI>garnished.</HI> It is made a place of delight: not merely empty of disagree∣able objects; but adorned with many things, which give pleasurable entertain∣ment. Altho' it is most certain, that Sa∣tan can give no spiritual joy, or any appro∣bation of <HI>conscience:</HI> yet he can do much to stupify it. He blinds the mind; paints sin in gay colours; and adds delight to sensual gratifications. Hence, the man feels no pain, from bitter reflexions on the turpitude of his heart and life. The Devil smiles; the man is pleased; and carnal pleasures circulate in one continued round of painted vice and diabolical rage; until he awakes to new sensations before the throne of God.—Or, in the style of our text; as men, when they set out on family life, take care to have a dwelling fitted to their circumstances; that it is clean, paint∣ed and adorned, for an agreeable reception: so this man, by his own act, finds this house empty and swept of all good; and Satan, his spiritual husband, has garnished it with diabolic pleasure, for his reception. —This leads us,</P>
<P>Fifthly, To consider the man's conduct, in taking a renewed possession of his house.</P>
<P><HI>He taketh with himself, seven other spirits
<PB N="24" REF="024115_0022_0FC3A537737EADA0"/>
more wicked than himself, and they enter in, and dwell there.</HI></P>
<P>This man does not return alone: he is not content to live in solitary mood; but seeks company. He has long been restrain∣ed, by notions of priest-craft, and religious whims (as he terms them) but now, hav∣ing come to his reason again, is determined to make up for lost time.</P>
<P>It is almost universally true, that per∣sons, who have had great illumination and strong convictions; when they lose these convictions, prove much more loose and profane, than before. But the man who maliciously denies the Spirit of God, and wilfully returns to his former state of sin and security; has no restraint of consci∣ence left: but spurred on by Satan, he gives full loose to all his carnal appetites. Natural fear and ambition are all that con∣troul his conscience, from acting out the spite and malice of devils, according to his ability.</P>
<P>Hence, he is said to take seven other spi∣rits more wicked than himself. It is ob∣servable, that seven is used in scripture often, as a certain number for an uncer∣tain; thus seven devils are said to be cast out of Mary Magdalene. It is also used,
<PB N="25" REF="024115_0023_0FC3A5398FA0E678"/>
as a number of perfection: thus, we read of seven candlesticks, seven viols—trum∣pets—seals, plagues, &amp;c. Thus his taking seven other spirits, implies, that he is to∣tally left of God's Spirit; given up to the dominion of devils; and the lusts of his own hard heart. He is now a fit object for the Devil to vent his malice upon, a∣gainst Christ: and certainly, he will spare no pains, to raise his triumph against the Redeemer's kingdom. The man is pleased with the service, and never more delighted than when railing and scoffing at religion. Thus we find those, who have apostatised from the Cristian profession, always harp∣ing on the inconsistency and unreasonable∣ness of the Christian religion: scoffing at the convictions of the Spirit, and terrors of conscience, as mere enthusiasm and de∣lusion: boasting of their own knowledge, and high attainments of living according to reason: consequently endeavouring to lead others into the like courses; and thus running merrily down the broad way of perdition.</P>
<P>The man, being thus given up to his own lusts, and the influences of Satan, is said to <HI>take other spirits more wicked than himself.</HI> They are exceedingly different from his feelings and endeavors before, and
<PB N="26" REF="024115_0024_0FC3A53B13C19E00"/>
while under the awakenings of the Spirit of God. He has now no spiritual restraint; but every evil passion reigns uncontrouled. Like a bow doubly strained, he springs back with double force. Having been restrain∣ed by conviction, and obliged to seek rest in dry places, he returns, determined to make up lost time. His soul is possessed with devils and lusts: his heart is hell in the beginning; pressing fast on to perfec∣tion of misery.</P>
<P>These spirits are said to <HI>enter in, and dwell there.</HI>—Before his wilful apostacy, they were not settled and immovable, but were often disturbed by the spirit of Christ: but now they are settled and fixed in the heart: not for a month, or year; but for <HI>eternity.</HI> The man is left a prey to his lusts. He has done despite to the Spirit of all grace: and God says (concerning him) <HI>there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins.</HI></P>
<P>I now pass to the last division of the words, viz.</P>
<P>Sixthly, <HI>And the last state of that man is worse than the first.</HI></P>
<P>This is evident at first blush: he is now unalterably fixed in a state of sin and secu∣rity. At first, he was not absolutely de∣termined against Christ, and his salvation;
<PB N="27" REF="024115_0025_0FC3A53C9A48FD18"/>
but lay open to conviction: his heart ad∣mitted the Spirit, and acknowledged his power; else, would never gone out against him, seeking rest. That he has had his day of grace, even as others, and might have accepted: but his proud heart would not bow to the cross of Christ. He valued his blind reason, more than a divine re∣velation, and conviction of conscience. He violently shut his eyes against the light: and with spite, rejected the Holy Ghost; imputing his influences to Beelzebub, the Prince of Devils. He hated God, and the works of his Spirit: and therefore rejected them and went back to his house from whence he came out: and finally, with other Spirits, has joined against God, and his method of salvation.</P>
<P>Thus, he has sinned with his eyes open, and has no cloak for his sin. Pride, infi∣delity and malice, are deep rooted in his heart, and prevent any further convictions: the heart is bared by a wilful obstinacy. The Spirit, by which alone God works effi∣caciously on the heart, he contemptuously calls Beelzebub: consequently, the Holy Ghost can operate on him in no character but of the Devil: and as such, must drive him further off from God; and plunge him deeper into the gulph of hell. Agree∣able
<PB N="28" REF="024115_0026_0FC3A53E1747CB08"/>
to this, St. Paul says, <HI>it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were partakers of the Holy Ghost, if they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance.</HI>—not im∣possible for the want of merit in Christ, or good-will in God; but because he does des∣pite to the Spirit of Christ, and computes his influences to the evil Spirits; by which, he must drive the man from God: no other effect can follow. Hence the man cannot be brought home to God on the gospel plan; consequently, in no way at all: there is no way open for saving conviction.</P>
<P>Moreover, this sin of wilful and mali∣cious rejection of the Spirit, is of such heinous nature, that God has declared, <HI>it shall not be forgiven neither in this world, nei∣ther in the world to come.</HI> Thus, in whatever point of light we view this last state of the man, we find it worse than the first.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE learn, that no striving against our convictions, and the gospel method of salvation, can bring peace to the soul: yet, this search after rest, will have very differ∣ent effects upon different persons.</P>
<P>All mankind have natural desires of hap∣piness, and aversion to misery. Hence, un∣der
<PB N="29" REF="024115_0027_0FC3A53FA2873008"/>
awakenings and convictions of the Spi∣rit, they are in continual search of rest. At such time, there is no peace in the soul: the strong man is disturbed by the man who is stronger than he. Awakened sin∣ners labour under a deep sense of guilt, and direful apprehensions of punishment: to which we add, that the Devil will by no means be idle on such occasions: his king∣dom is invaded. While Christ awakens on the one hand, Satan will strive on the other, by fallacy and cunning, to lull into security, or despondence; or else, drive the man to violent resistance. Thus, there is a constant uproar in the soul: contending passions distract the man.</P>
<P>Some go out against their convictions, with strong passions and violent efforts: others, more mild and trembling: but all, for a season, go <HI>through dry places seeking rest and finding none.</HI> Infidelity and pride, will not close with offered mercy: yet, no man can at once cast off all conviction, and persuade himself that the influences of the Spirit are a falsehood and delusion of the Devil. Consequently he hurries from ar∣gument to argument; from one ground of trust to another; that, if possible, he may quiet conscience; have some merit in his salvation; and maintain his carnal pride: or, as he flatters himself, support the dignity of human reason, and free-agency.
<PB N="30" REF="024115_0028_0FC3A541121E4A58"/>
Although reason, scripture and an awakened conscience, constantly stare him in the face, and declare his utter ina∣bility to save himself; yet the Devil and carnal heart, extol human reason and natu∣ral ability; press on to false argumenta∣tion and works of self-righteousness. But alas, instead of rest to his soul, he finds dreadful and alarming disappointment.</P>
<P>Just like a man famishing with thirst, in a dry and thirsty desert; who runs from valley to valley, and to every place which has an appearance of a spring, that he may drink and save life: but none is to be found So the awakened sinner, runs to every thing but Christ, which has any ap∣pearance of possibility or plausibility; but to no good purpose; except to clearer views of himself, as wretched and undone: the further he goes in these dry places, the more miserable he finds himself.</P>
<P>This fruitless search for happiness out of Christ, has very different effects on the human heart.</P>
<P>Some grow fretful and angry against God, themselves, and fellow-men: they resolve to bear these disappointments no longer; accuse God of partiality; spite reli∣gion; abuse its professors; deride the ope∣rations of the divine Spirit; call the awak∣enings of sinners priest-craft and delusion of the Devil; violently cast off their con∣victions
<PB N="31" REF="024115_0029_0FC3A543535E0DB8"/>
as diabolic; wilfully return to their house, like the dog to his vomet; and run seven fold faster, in the way of perdition, than heretofore. These are eter∣nally lost, as we have just shewn.</P>
<P>Others, seeking rest and finding none, grow melancholy, and fall into a kind of mopish despondency: they tease themselves and dishonor God. They expected to have found peace long ago; but are con∣stantly deceived: their state grows darker and darker: God will not regard them: He is a hard master: and they cannot see, that it answers any purpose to serve him. In this state, they bury their talent; neg∣lect the means and advantages put into their hands; and set down in the spiritual desert, purposing to go no further; but if they die they die; if they live they live.</P>
<P>These are proud beggars, who serve God merely for hire; and not receiving wages, they leave off work; accuse God of par∣tiality, and backwardness to pardon. Yet, in their fretful submission, they flatter themselves with gospel humiliation and resignation. The whole, is melancholy fretfulness, and gloomy despondence. And the ordinary means of conviction being neglected, renders it very difficult to renew them unto repentance.</P>
<P>Again, others, through a naturally care∣less and indolent frame of mind, grow re∣miss:
<PB N="32" REF="024115_0030_0FC3A54D19D524D8"/>
or else, through a too confident dis∣position, think they have obtained pardon, when they have not. The consequence in both is, that they grow dull in duties; cold in affection; and in great measure, insen∣sible to their former fears and convictions: and so, live either in a careless, or over confident round of morals. Such falls from awakenings, give great reason to fear, that the spirit of conviction will not spee∣dily return.</P>
<P>But again, this search after rest, has an opposite effect on others: they grow more watchful, more fearful, more engaged to look for, and perform duty. They see and feel the righteousness of God, in putting off: yet, like the importunate widow, with the Judge, they incessantly ask and seek. They let nothing divert them from the ap∣pointed means of salvation. While they acknowledge the dog unworthy of the chil∣dren's bread, they plead for the crumbs which fall from the master's table.</P>
<P>These are humble beggers: though they see want, they do not feel deserving. They cry for mercy: and any crumb, from the table of God's grace, is received with thank∣fulness.—This is the only proper use of our convictions. God is glorified: the sinner is humbled, and in due time, may hope to be exalted.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="024115_0031_0FC3A5549255D900"/>Thus we find no resisting of the illumi∣nations of the Spirit of God, can bring peace to the soul: and yet, this search af∣ter rest, will have very different effects on different persons: of which, one only, is absolutely fatal. All others are pardona∣ble; though in some cases difficult and improbable,</P>
<P N="2">2. We infer, that great danger attends the setting up of our wills, in opposition to the light of conscience and revelation.</P>
<P>This dethrones conscience, and denies Christ. It is a fearful step towards, and near approach to, that sin which cannot be for∣given; yet much indulged in the present degenerate age. Some openly deny a di∣vine revelation; and many others do it implicitly: setting up human reason a∣gainst infinite wisdom. They will not ad∣mit a revelation from God; because they cannot comprehend it: which, if they could, would be a sufficient reason to dis∣believe it. But such is the pride and cor∣ruption of the human heart, that all reli∣gion must be brought up to their standard. Not feeling themselves totally depraved, they infer, that man may save himself: or at least, do that good which will obligate God to save him.</P>
<P>Hence they walk by their own wills, rather than a revelation: strive to stifle all
<PB N="34" REF="024115_0032_0FC3A556158CBD28"/>
convictions; and traverse all the fields of false argumentation, to prove them absurd and ridiculous. No religion, no preach∣ing, no convictions, or experiences are of any consequence, unless squared by their rule, and made subservient to their interest.</P>
<P>However unnoticed, this conduct is cer∣tainly highly criminal: and, though gilded with the name of <HI>rational,</HI> that reason must be exceedingly perverse, which is subject to the human will, and repugnant to the God of reason. To which we add, that such conduct is a near approach to the unpar∣donable sin: the next step will be irrecov∣erable. Let them but decidedly resolve to follow this reason, in opposition to the light of revelation, and an awakened con∣science; then, the nature of things, and a divine revelation determine them eternally lost So that it appears exceedingly danger∣ous to set up our wills, in opposition to the light of conscience and revelation, and force our reason against infinite wisdom.</P>
<P N="3">3. We learn the peculiar nature of that sin against the Holy Ghost, which cannot be forgiven.</P>
<P>A man may commit many sins and of great aggravation: he may be a long time under spiritual conviction, and fall from this conviction into his former state of ease and security: yet not commit the unpar∣donable sin. Though most certainly, such
<PB N="35" REF="024115_0033_0FC3A5579E29D510"/>
sinning and such apostatising are exceed∣ingly heinous in the sight of God; and if persisted in, without repentance, will bring final death. Yet, in their nature, they may be pardonable.</P>
<P>But this sin against the Holy Ghost, which is unto death, is of a peculiar colour: it is of the blackest die: It is a sin of know∣ledge, against great light, repeated warn∣ings, and strong evidence. It is a wilful, deliberate contempt of the holy Spirit: a perverse denial of his operations, and ma∣licious imputation of them unto infernal spirits. <HI>By Beelzebub the Prince of the De∣vils, he casteth out Devils,</HI> said the Scribes.</P>
<P>This most effectually bars the door a∣gainst any further conviction; for the spi∣rit can operate on the man, in no charac∣ter but of the Devil; consequently, he lives at ease and security in sin. Yet, though he finds his house empty, swept and garnish∣ed, his last end is worse than the first. As he feels no troublesome convictions; so on the contrary he has no approbation of con∣science; therefore no real happiness. His pleasures are as the madness of laughter, which lead down to death. He lives mere∣ly to fill up the measure of his sins, that God, in ages to come, may make more full and glorious displays of his power, in his eternal damnation.—Therefore,</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="36" REF="024115_0034_0FC3A5591CC92018"/>4. Let us examine ourselves, how we have conducted under our awakenings.</P>
<P>It is observable that we have had great sight, and great opportunity to know God, and the truth of the gospel. We have strong proof of the fulfilment of ancient prophesies and miracles, wrought in con∣firmation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The present dispersion of the Jews, their continued infidelity, and state of religious polity, are a standing fulfilment of pro∣phesy, and a living miracle, in proof of the gospel.</P>
<P>The miracles of Christ, together with his last sign to the Jews, the sign of the prophet Jonas, are attested by the enemies of the cross, and sealed by the blood of its friends. It is ridiculous to suppose the enemies should acknowledge, or the friends lay down their lives in proof of what they knew to be a falsehood. That, allowing men common sense and common honesty, the facts are true beyond reasonable doubt.</P>
<P>In addition to this, every one of us, who have arrived to years of discretion, have felt the Spirit of God, witnessing on our hearts the truth of the gospel revelation. But how have we conducted under this light and knowledge? have we not shut our eyes, stopped our ears, and hardened our hearts, lest we should see, understand, and be con∣verted? have we not considered the service
<PB N="37" REF="024115_0035_0FC3A55AB1CD5420"/>
of God as burdensome; of but little or no importance; a mere piece of policy and priest-craft? Have we not considered sea∣sons of spiritual awakenings, as enthusiasm and delusion, detrimental to the honor, pleasures, and interest of mankind? And have we not gone out against those con∣victions, with an unclean spirit, designing to make them appear absurd and redicu∣lous; and strove, by false argumentation, to set aside the gospel method of salvation? And though we have walked through dry places, seeking rest and finding none; yet, have we not perversely followed our search, against light and reason, rather than em∣brace the truth?—But admitting that we have received the spirit of conviction; how often have we grieved him to depart: how often strove to cast off convictions, and lull conscience asleep, by going to our cups, our beds, our work or diversion?—And while we have pretended to cherish our convictions, did not our dulness and inattention, give rea∣son for self-condemnation? When God has continued us under long awakenings, and delayed to answer our requests; have we not felt heart-risings against him; been fretful, and set down in the spiritual desert, neglect∣ing the means of knowing God, ourselves and our duty?—And at other times, have we not been proud of our spiritual attainments, and imagined that we have obtained the
<PB N="38" REF="024115_0036_0FC3A55C25E56E68"/>
peace of God; when we had not so seen our own hearts, as to mourn for the deceitful∣ness and wickedness thereof?</P>
<P>These things call for speedy and serious attention. All opposition to, or neglect of the Spirit, is an high provocation to God; and very dangerous to our souls. They who refuse to be brought home to God, in his way, will never come in any; but must die without mercy.</P>
<P>Let us then carefully examine our hearts, reform our lives, and bring forth fruit un∣to God. Let us receive the spirit of con∣viction, with humbling and self-abasing thoughts; and high and admiring thoughts of the divine love and goodness. Let us be patient under the hand of God; wait his time, and in his way, for a blessing: knowing, that if ever we receive, or what∣ever good we may receive, it is of grace; and ought to be received with thanksgiving.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let all who are seeking rest, and find∣ing none, under their convictions imme∣diately embrace offered mercy.</P>
<P>It is impossible to find an approving con∣science out of Christ: it is seeking in dry and barren places. The evidences of the spirit, and gospel truth, cannot be destroy∣ed by carnal argumentation: the awaken∣ed conscience will never find rest from car∣nal reasoning. How full of madness, then, to procrastinate, while Christ is knocking
<PB N="39" REF="024115_0037_0FC3A55D900D3120"/>
at the door of our hearts? It destroys peace in this life, and risks eternal happiness in the next. Now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation, while the spirit is striving: but the morrow may be too late. Death may intervene; sin may shut the door of grace; or God may say, <HI>He is join∣ed unto idols let him alone.</HI></P>
<P>The longer we put off, so much more is God offended, so much more is Christ slight∣ed, and so much more the Holy Ghost is grieved. We also grow more wilful, more stubborn, and more perverse; consequent∣ly, more likely to fall away irrecoverably. Let us then awake to a sense of our danger, and of our duty: cease to oppose God and his salvation. Let us no more walk thro' the barren fields of beclouded reason after rest: but let us consider our convictions as the work of God; and humbly accept of offered mercy; fervently praying God, that our convictions may be effectual to saving conversion.</P>
<P>But if any of you are resolved to go on in the way of your own hearts, and in the sight of your own eyes, adding sin to sin; to make your brows as brass, and your hearts as adamant; to stifle all conviction, and go back to your house of carnal rest; then, go on—take your own way. But be assured, <HI>that the day of the Lord is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall
<PB N="40" REF="024115_0038_0FC3A55F6819DA98"/>
it come: He will whet his glittering sword, and his hand shall take hold on judgment: He will render vengeance to his enemies, and re∣ward them that hate him: He will make his arrows drunk with blood; with the blood of the slain, from the beginning of revenge upon the enemy</HI> Then shall the brazen brow be broke; and the adamantine heart will burst into ten thousand pieces: stifled convictions will have a fearful resurrection, as so ma∣ny arrows of death, to torment the soul throughout the endless ages of eternity.</P>
<P>Awake then, oh procrastinating sinner, awake! Be wise, and consider your latter end. Improve the present moments, and accept of offered mercy. Drop all your sins, your sorrows, your fears and doubts at the foot-stool of the cross of Jesus Christ. Arise with him to newness of life, and bring forth fruit unto God. Then the riches of God's grace will be glorified in your par∣don and salvation: you will be accepted in Christ the beloved, and admitted into the society of the church of the first born of God in Heaven, to raise the trophies, and sing the triumphs of redeeming love.— Which, may God grant for the sake of Je∣sus Christ, our ascended Lord, and Re∣deemer.—AMEN.</P>
