<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE LATE <HI>Rev. Mr. JAMES HERVEY,</HI> M. A. RECTOR OF WESTON-FAVELL, IN NORTH-AM<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>TONSHIRE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reverend Mr. James Hervey was born on Friday the 26th of Fe∣bruary, 1713-14, at Hardingstone, a vil∣lage about a mile from Northampton; his mother taught him to read, and kept him at home till he was seven years old, when he was sent as a day scholar to the free grammar school at Northampton; there he continued under the tuition of a Mr. Clarke, master of the school, and vicar of St. Se∣pulchre's in that parish, till he was seven∣teen, learning the Latin and Greek languag∣es, in which he would have made a much earlier progress, had he not been kept back by his master, who (out of a blind pater∣nal
<PB N="14" REF="030558_0011_0FE7CA3D0E23BC58"/>affection and partiality) would suffer none of his scholars to learn faster than his own son.</P>
<P>In the year 1731 he was sent by his fa∣ther to the university of Oxford, and enter∣od a Fellow of Lincoln College, where he resided seven years, and took his degree of Batchelor of Arts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hervey took his degree of Master of arts at Cam∣bridge in 1752 and entered at Clarehall.</NOTE>; during his continuance here, he made himself master of Dr. Keil's Anatomy, Dr. Derham's Physico and As∣tro-Theology, and Spectacle de la Nature, translated by Mr. Humphrey's, which last work he read with peculiar pleasure; nor was he less delighted with the Rev. Mr. Spence's Essay on Pope's Odyssey, to which he often acknowledged himself greatly in∣debted for his improvement in stile and composition.</P>
<P>He entered into holy orders as soon as his age and the cannons of the church would allow, and became curate to his father, who was then possessed of the living of Weston-Favell and Collingtree, near Northamp∣ton; in the year 1738, he went by invita∣tion to Stoke Abbey, the seat of his valua∣ble friend, Paul Orchard, Esq. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This gentleman was the father of Paul Orchard, Esq. for whom Mr. Hervey stood sponsor, and to whom he dedicated the second volume of his Meditations.</NOTE> here he
<PB N="15" REF="030558_0012_0FE7CA3E98E31800"/>continued above two years, greatly esteem∣ed and respected.</P>
<P>In the year 1740 he undertook the cura∣cy of Biddeford, fourteen miles from Stoke Abbey; here he had a large congregation, though the income, with the assistance of friends, did not exceed sixty pounds a year <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This sum, though hardly sufficient to maintain him, he enjoyed with thankfulness, and was universally beloved for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> piety, humility, and diligent discharge of his duty.</NOTE>; in this place, and very probably about this time, he planned his ingenious meditations; the first volume of which was published in February, 1745-6, and the second in De∣cember, 1747, which have been so well re∣ceived by the public, that the twenty-first edition of them appeared last year.</P>
<P>About the year 1743 he returned from Biddeford to Weston-Favell, leaving behind him many disconsolate friends <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The rector dying, and the new one dismissing Mr. Her∣vey from the curacy (though against the consent of all the pa∣rishoners, who would have maintained him at their own ex∣pence) was the occasion of his leaving Biddeford.</NOTE>; and conti∣nued curate to his sather till June 1750, at which time, being greatly impaired in health occasioned by his constant attention to his duty <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This, if it may be stiled a fault, few, if any of our clergy∣men in the present day, can be charged with.</NOTE>, he removed to London to try what
<PB N="16" REF="030558_0013_0FE7CA45247782A0"/>effect a change of air and relaxation of mind would have upon him: here he staid from June, 1750, till about May, 1752, in which time he had a very severe and dangerous sit of illness; being recovered, and his father dying in this year, he returned to Weston-Favell, and succeeded him in that and the living of Collingtree, worth about one hun∣dred and eighty pounds a year.</P>
<P>In November following he puolished, in a letter to a lady of quality, his remarks on Lord Bollingbroke's letters on the study and use of history, so far as they relate to the history of the Old Testament, and espe∣cially to the case of Noah denouncing a curse upon Canaan; the next year he pub∣lished, for the benefit of a poor sick child, a sermon which he preached at the visitati∣on of the Archdeacon of Northampton, un∣der the title of "The Cross of Christ, the Christian's glory;" a few months afterwards he wrote a recommendatory preface to Burnham's pious memorials.</P>
<P>In 1755 he published his Theron and As∣pasio, or dialogues and letters on the most important and interesting subjects, which met with great approbation from the un∣prejudiced and discerning, excepting those who differed in religious sentiments from Mr. Hervey, concerning the imputed righ∣teousness
<PB N="17" REF="030558_0014_0FE7CA46B21A9960"/>of Christ, of which these dia∣logues principally treat; especially the Re∣verend Mr. John Wesley, Sandeman, and a few others <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. John Wesley, Sandeman, and several other persons, published letters in answer, or rather opposition to Mr. Hervey's Theron and Aspasio, some little time after the publica∣tion of the latter; endeavouring to prove Mr. Hervey's senti∣ments erroneous and unscriptural, which Mr. Hervey together with several friends and espousers of his tenets answered. <HI>(See a Desence of Theren and Aspasio, printed for C. Dilly in the Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣try</HI>)</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In August 1757, Mr. Hervey published three sermons which he had preached on public fast-days, to which have been since added, his visitation sermon preached in 1753, his posthumous sermon on <Q>the mi∣nistry of Reconciliation,</Q> and his <Q>Con∣siderations on the prevailing custom or fa∣shion of visiting on Sundays;</Q> all which evidently manifested his genuine piety, and earnest desire to promote the cause and in∣terest of his great Lord and Master.</P>
<P>In this year also, he published a new edi∣tion of his favorite author, Mr. Jenk's Me∣ditations, in two volumes, with a strong re∣commendatory preface, shewing the use and excellency of them; but his conititution be∣ing weak, and his illness (which was of the consumptive kind, under which he had la∣boured for several months, with singular pa∣tience
<PB N="18" REF="030558_0015_0FE7CA4B49FED298"/>and submission) increasing on him a∣bout October, 1758, gave great reason to fear his usefulness would soon be terminated, as it proved; for on the 2d of December following, in the evening, after praying with his family, he seemed to be arrested by the stroke of death, so that it was with difficul∣ty his sister and servant got him up stairs to his own room: from this time, growing worse every day, he became sensible that his end was near. He had now frequent and violent fits of the cramp, which gave him great pain, and a hestic cough, which was so bad at night, that he could seldom lie in bed till four o'clock in the morning, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hervey, when in health, usually got up about six in the morning in winter, and much earlier in summer.</NOTE> and oblig∣ed him often to get up at two.</P>
<P>On the 15th of this month he complain∣ed of a pain in his side, for which he was blooded, at his own desire, though against the consent of his worthy friend and physi∣cian Dr. Stonhouse; who apprehen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d him too weak to bear it. When the surgeon came, he could scarcely perceive any pulsa∣tion, and therefore took away only four oun∣ces of blood, intimating to those around, that the case was desperate.</P>
<P>The Rev. Mr. Abraham Maddocks, his
<PB N="19" REF="030558_0016_0FE7CA4D63E1CA80"/>curate, being with him in the afternoon, Mr. Hervey spoke to him in very strong and pathetic terms of his assurance of faith, and of the love of God in Christ. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These were his expressions, <Q>O what and how much has Christ done for me, and how little have I done for so loving a Saviour! If I preached even once a week, it was at last a bur∣den to me; I have not visited the people of my parish as I ought to have done, and thus have preached as it were from house to house; I have not taken every opportunity of speak∣ing for Christ.</Q> These expressions were accompanied with fears, which, lest they should be misinterpreted, as they had been conversing of his approaching end, and his assurance of faith, he proceeded thus:—<Q>Don't think that I am afraid to die; I assure you I am not. I know what my Saviour has done for me, and I want to be gone; but I wonder and lament to think of the love of Christ, in doing so much for me, and how little I have done for him.</Q>
—In another conversation, discoursing likewise of his ap∣proaching dissolution (which he always did with the utmost calmness and serenity,) and of the little which we know of God's word, he said, <Q>How many precious texts are there, big with the most rich truths of Christ, which we cannot comprehend, which we know nothing of; and of those we do know, how few do we remember? A good textuary is a good divine, and that is the armour, the word of God is the sword. Those texts are the weapons which I must use, when that subtle spirit that arch-adversary of mankind, comes to tempt and sift me in my last conflict. Surely I had need be well provided with these weapons; I had need have my qui∣ver full of them, to answer Satan with texts out of the word of God when he assaults me.</Q></NOTE>On the nineteenth the pains of his body abated, and he grew drowsy and lethargic; the next day Dr. Stonhouse came to see him, and decla∣red, in his opinion, Mr. Hervey could not live above four days longer. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Doctor happening, on this visit, to speak of the many consolations through Christ, which a good man enjoys in the prospect of death; and discoursing on the emptiness of worldly honour to an immortal, and the unprofitableness of riches to the ungodly Mr. Hervey replied, <Q>True, Doctor, true; the only valuable treasures are in heaven; what would it avail me now, to be archbishop of Canterbury. Disease would shew no re∣spect to my mitre. It is godliness and not grandeur that will avail me hereafter. The gospel is offered to me, a poor coun∣try parson, the same as it is to his Grace. Christ makes no difference between us. Oh! why then do ministers thus ne∣glect the charge of so kind a Saviour; fawn upon the great, and hunt after worldly preferments with so much eagerness, to the disgrace of our orders? These, these are the things, Doctor, and not our poverty or obscurity which render the clergy so justly contemptible to the worldlings. No wonder the service of our church, grieved I am to say it, is become such a formal lifeless thing, since it is, alas! too generally exe∣cuted by persons dead to godliness in all their conversation; whose indifferent religion and worldly minded behaviour pro∣claim the little regard they pay to the doctrines of the Lord who bought them.</Q></NOTE></P>
<PB N="20" REF="030558_0017_0FE7CA535C806300"/>
<P>The day before his death, Mr. Hervey went a few steps across his room, but find∣ing his strength sailing him, he sunk, rather than fell down, his fall being broken by his sister, who observing his weakness ran and caught him; but he fainted away, and was to all human appearance dead, it being a considerable time before any pulse could be perceived.</P>
<P>When he came to himself, and his bro∣ther, Mr. William Hervey, who was come from London to visit him, said, we were afraid you was gone; he answered, <Q>I wish I had.</Q> And well he might wish so, considering his painful and melancholy con∣dition; for his strength was exhausted, his
<PB N="21" REF="030558_0018_0FE7CA55A2F2EA28"/>body extremely emaciated, and his bones so sore that he could not bear any one to touch him hardly, when it was necessary to move him; yet in the midst of his suf∣ferings, he was ever praising God, for his mercies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He never received a bit of lemon to moisten his mouth, without thanking God for his goodness, in creating so many helps and refreshments to a sick decaying body.</NOTE>, and for granting him patience <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">A few years before he died, when Mr. Hervey was at his brother's house in London, he had a severe fever, in which he had several blisters; on this occasion Mr. William Hervey writ∣ing to one of his intimate friends says, <Q>My brother is indeed an example of patience; he has not spoke one single word of peevishness during his whole illness.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>On the 25th (Christmas day) on which he died, Mr. Maddocks paying him a morn∣ing visit, Mr. Hervey lift his head and opened his eyes, as he fat in his easy chair (for he could not lie down) to see who it was, and said, "Sir, I cannot talk with you now."</P>
<P>He complained much all the day of a great inward conslict, which he had, lay∣ing his hand upon his breast, and saying, <Q>O! you know not how great a conflict I have.</Q> During this time he almost con∣stantly lift his eyes towards heaven, with his hands clasped together in praying form, and said two or three times,—<Q>When this great conflict is over, then—</Q> but said
<PB N="22" REF="030558_0019_0FE7CA5B62862280"/>no more; though we may naturally suppose he meant then he should be at rest. Dr. Stonhouse came to see him about three hours before he died. Mr. Hervey strong∣ly and affectionately urged on him the im∣portance and care of his everlasting con∣cerns, as here is no abiding place; and in∣treated him not to be over-charged with the cares of this life, but to attend to the one thing needful.</P>
<Q><L>"Which done, the poorest can no wants endure,</L>
<L>"And which not done, the richest must be poor. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Hervey was very fond of, and used frequently to re∣peat these lines with a peculiar emphasis.</NOTE>"</L></Q>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL>
<P>The doctor seeing the great difficulty and pain with which he spoke (for he was al∣most suffocated with phlegm and frequent vomitings) and finding by his pulse, that the pangs of death were then coming on; desired that he would spare himself: "No," said he, <Q>Doctor, no; you tell me I have but a few moments to live, O! let me spend them in adoring our great Re∣deemer.</Q> He then repeated the 26th verse of the lxxiii Psalm; <Q>Though my flesh and my heart fail me, yet God is the strength of my heart and my porti∣on for ever.</Q></P>
<P>A little while after this he expatiated in
<PB N="23" REF="030558_0020_0FE7CA5CF920CD38"/>a most striking manner on the 1st of Co∣rinthians, chap. iii. ver. 22, 23. <Q>All things are yours, life and death;—for ye are Christ's.</Q> "Here," says he, <Q>is the treasure of a Christian. Death is reckoned among this inventory, and a noble treasure it is. How thankful am I for death, as it is the passage through which I pass to the Lord and Giver of eternal life; and as it frees me from all this misery, you now see me endure, and which I am willing to endure as long as God thinks fit; for I know he will by and by, in his own good time, dismiss me from the body. These light afflicti∣ons are but for a moment, and then comes an eternal weight of glory. Oh welcome, welcome death! thou mayest well be reckoned among the treasures of the Christian—To live is Christ, but to die is gain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philippians, i. 21.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Here he paused a little, and then with great serenity and sweetness in his counte∣nance, repeated those words: <Q>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy most holy and comfort∣able words, for mine eyes have seen thy precious salvation <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 29, 30.</NOTE>.</Q> <Q>Here, Doctor, is my cordial: what are all the cordials
<PB N="24" REF="030558_0021_0FE7CA62B6164C58"/>given to support the dying in compari∣son of that, which arises from the pro∣mises of salvation by Christ? this, this supports me.</Q>—About three o'clock he said, <Q>the great conflict is over, now all is done.</Q> After which he scarce spoke any words intelligibly, except now and then, "precious salvation."</P>
<P>During the last hour he said nothing, but leaned his head against the side of his easy chair, and in this posture, without a sigh, groan, or struggle, shut his eyes eternally on this world, and died in the Lord, be∣tween four and five o'clock in the afternoon of Christmas day, 1758, and in the forty-fifth year of his age.</P>
<P>When his body was conveyed to the silent chambers of the grave, it was cover∣ed by his own express desire with the poor's pall, and he was buried under the commu∣nion table in the chancel of Weston-Favell church, on Friday, December 28th, in the presence of a numerous congregation, full of regret for the loss of so excellent a pas∣tor: his funeral indeed was a most awful and very affecting sight. Mr. Maddocks, his curate, who buried him, was himself in tears;—some were wringing their hands, others sobbing; many were silently weep∣ing,
<PB N="25" REF="030558_0022_0FE7CA6449FC4640"/>but all were inwardly and sincerely grieved, as their looks sufficiently testified.</P>
<P>It may truly be said of him, that few lives have ever been more heavenly:—few deaths have ever been more triumphant.— He died in the Lord, and is now at rest, where even the wicked cease from trou∣bling: his name is recorded in the annals of eternity, and the honours conferred on him by Christ, will for ever continue blooming and incorruptible in the world of glory.</P>
<P>His character, both in his public and private capacity, was of the most exem∣plary kind.</P>
<P>As a minister he performed all the du∣ties of that office with the greatest strict∣ness. —In the pulpit he was earnest and fervent, and shewed that he felt the effi∣cacy of what he preached. Nor did he think it sufficient to preach on Sabbaths only, but set up a weekly lecture eve∣ry Wednesday evening at Weston-Favell church. The last two or three years of his life he could scarce do any thing more than preach once on the Sabbath, when people from many miles around flocked to hear him. His Wednesday evening lecture at seven, he discontinued for the last year. He had not been able for some time to
<PB N="26" REF="030558_0023_0FE7CA6A02FC1578"/>preach at Collingtree, or to visit his pa∣rishioners at their own houses, as his cus∣tom had been; but he encouraged them to come to him, and to converse freely up∣on the subjects relating to their eternal in∣terests, and on such occasions he would speak with a force and propriety peculiar to himself.</P>
<P>He always preached without notes, ex∣cept on some very particular occasions; and his method was judicious, clear, and not encumbered with too many subdivisi∣ons. His weakness rendering him for se∣veral months before his death incapable of speaking to his congregation as usual, he shortened his discourses, and took a most useful method of inculcating his instructi∣ons; for after he had expounded his text, and divided his sermon into two heads, (rarely into more, and never exceeding three) he would speak briesly, and at the conclu∣sion of each head ensorce what he had said, by a pertinent text of scripture, desiring his congregation (which was generally very numerous) to turn to their bibles, and dou∣ble down the text. "Now", added he, <Q>my dear brethren, if you forget my ser∣mon, you cannot forget God's word in this text, unless you wilfully throw your bibles aside. Shew these to your chil∣dren, or the absent part of your family
<PB N="27" REF="030558_0024_0FE7CA6B8E286F78"/>when you return home.</Q>—Then he gave a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riking exhortation, at the end of it another text for them to double down, so that he had always three texts; in order to their finding of which, he paused in the pulpit two or three minutes.</P>
<P>He endeavoured as much as possible to divest himself in his public discourses of his usual elegance of stile, and to adapt his lan∣guage to the lowest capacity. In this he followed the example of Luther, who in his table talk says, <Q>If in my preaching I were to pay a regard to Philip Melancthon, and other learned divines, then I should do lit∣tle good. I preach in the plainest man∣ner to the illiterate, and that gives con∣tent to all.</Q></P>
<P>His method of catechising children in church, and of speaking to them in private, was very engaging and useful. He would ask not only such questions as were suitable to the words of the catechism, but also such as would strike at the capital vices of his pa∣rishioners, yet without giving personal of∣fence.</P>
<P>Some of his parishioners having lain in bed on the Sabbath morning longer than he approved, and others having been busy in foddering their cattle when he was coming
<PB N="28" REF="030558_0025_0FE7CA715FD33F50"/>to church, and several having frequented the alehouse, he thus catechised one of the chil∣dren before the congregation:—Repeat me the fourth commandment. Now, little man, do you understand the meaning of this com∣mandment? Yes sir.—Then if you do, you will be able to answer me these questi∣ons. —Do they keep holy the Sabbath-day who lie in bed till eight or nine o'clock in the morning instead of rising to say their prayers and read the Bible? No sir.—Do those keep the Sabbath who fodder their cattle when other people are going to church? No sir.—Does God Almighty bless such people as go to alehouses, and do not mind the instructions of their minister? No sir?—Do not those that love God read the bible to their samilies, particularly on Sabbath-day evening, and have prayers eve∣ry morning and night in their houses? Yes sir.</P>
<P>He usually breakfasted at nine, after hav∣ing called his family together, and required each of his servants to repeat by heart the text which he had explained the preceding evening, and then he would recapitulate his exposition; by which method both his text and commentary were imprinted on their memories: after this he had prayers.</P>
<P>In the afternoon when he was called down
<PB N="29" REF="030558_0026_0FE7CA72ECA22D90"/>to tea, he usually brought his Hebrew Bible or Greek Testament with him, and would speak either upon one or more verses, as occasion offered; and in the summer season he would now and then drink tea, when his health would permit him, with some of his most serious parishioners; and then five or six of the neighbours were invited; and Mr. Hervey's conversation was remarkably im∣proving, as he had a happy talent at spiritu∣alizing almost every incident, and was natu∣rally of a most obliging and cheerful disposi∣tion.</P>
<P>In the exercise of his charity, he chose to clothe the poor rather than to give them money: and he would get some judicious person to buy linen, coarse cloth, stockings, shoes, &amp;c. for them at the best hand: al∣ledging that the poor could not purchase on such good terms what they wanted at the lit∣tle shops, and with small sums of money. "I am, said he, God's steward for the poor, and I must husband the little pittance I have to bestow upon them, and make it go as far as possible." But when money would be really serviceable to a family, as to a prudent house-keeper, distressed by sicknes or mis∣fortunes, he would give five or more guineas at a time; taking care that it should not be known whence the money came. He was particularly desirous of getting the advice of
<PB N="30" REF="030558_0027_0FE7CA78A6D02C28"/>a physician (or at least of some judicious a∣pothecary) for the sick poor; and was ever ready to procure them the very best medi∣cines. He would frequently petition such physicians of his acquaintance in different parts of the kingdom, as he apprehended to be charitably disposed, to give their advice occasionally when they rode through a town, to such poor creatures, as the clergyman of the place, or some substantial inhabitant, should recommend, as real objects of com∣passion. He greatly disapproved of the clergy's attempting to give medicine to their parishioners; as he thought it impossible for them to do it with the requisite judgment. "Let my brethren," he would say "give them wine, bread, or beer, and get good spoon-meats made for them; but medicines are of too important a nature to be given in∣discriminately." He observed that by his own method the sick poor had the very best medicines, as the physician saw them himself, and bought them very cheap; because the apothecary, knowing they were for charita∣ble uses, charged the physician no more than prime cost, with some little allowance mere∣ly for his trouble in compounding them; and as the physician knew what diseases were curable, there was no waste of medi∣cine in fruitless attempts to cure cases, which, though actually incurable, persons of less judgment could not pronounce to be so.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="030558_0028_0FE7CA7A34D5B220"/>
He gave away a great number of good books, with suitable instructions for their use, and especially Bibles. In the blank leaf he frequently wrote something striking, or else stuck in a printed paper, relating to the promises of God in and through Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>His income was but small, and it may be wondered how he managed it so well, as to have such large sums to spare for cha∣ritable uses. He sold the copy of his Me∣ditations, after it had passed through seve∣ral editions; which sale of the copy, and the profits of the former impressions, a∣mounted to about £.700, all which he gave away in charity. He made of it a bank for the poor. "This," said he, <Q>I have devoted to God, I will on no account apply it to any worldly uses: I write not for profit or for fame, but to serve the cause of God; and as he has blessed my attempt, I think myself bound to re∣lieve the distresses of my fellow creatures with the profit that comes from this quarter.</Q> He has likewise left all the future profits of his works to some of the charitable uses above specified.</P>
<P>In any expence relating to himself, he was extremely frugal, that he might be li∣beral to others; and it was always his de∣sire
<PB N="32" REF="030558_0029_0FE7CA8000EF9408"/>to die just even with the world. <Q>I will be my own executor,</Q> said he. And as he died on Christmas day, his fund ex∣pired almost with his life. What little re∣mained, he desired might be given in warm clothing to the poor in that severe season.</P>
<P>To the instances of his charity we may properly add an incident which affords a very strong proof, not only of the benevo∣lence of his heart, but of his regard to practical religion, and to the doing of eve∣ry good work within his power.</P>
<P>A day or two before his death, when he was reduced to such extreme weakness as to be unable to read, and could with diffi∣culty speak, a little account being settled with him by a friend, on the balance of which he received eighteen shillings, look∣ing on the money with great indifference, he expressed himself to this effect, "I would gladly dispose of this small sum in such a manner as may do the most good; it is the only act which I now am, and probably the last that I shall be able to persorm. Give yourself the trouble of looking amongst these books, and you will find Mr. Rich∣ard's pamphlet, at the latter end of which are, I remember, some hints concerning the means of promoting religion in ourselves and others, which (even with some additi∣ons
<PB N="33" REF="030558_0030_0FE7CA818CC02518"/>and improvements, which you might easily make) will not fill more than a sheet of paper; and if stuck up or framed, might be particularly useful in that form; let then such a number of them be printed and giv∣en away as this money will admit of." His orders were properly executed, and the evi∣dences of such an angelic temper were equally matter of edification and comfort to his friends, as this charitable legacy (if we may so call it) will be to all who receive and rightly use it.</P>
<P>This incident, it is to be hoped, will be candidly considered by those who draw such inferences from his favourite doctrine, and strong expressions of the all-sufficient righ∣teousness of Christ, as his whole life did in the most exemplary manner confute. No man had ever a greater disregard for money, which he esteemed unworthy of his notice, upon any other account than as it furnish∣ed him with the means of doing good. Sure∣ly we may here borrow the sentiment and expression of our celebrated poet, and just∣ly conclude, that,
<Q>"He felt his ruling passion strong in death."</Q></P>
<P>In learning he was inferior to few. Greek was almost as familiar to him as his native language. He was a great master of the
<PB N="34" REF="030558_0031_0FE7CA873B326758"/>classics; and in the younger part of his life had written some verses, which shewed no contemptible genius for poetry. He had a critical knowledge of the Hebrew tongue, and delighted in it.</P>
<P>With respect to his private capacity, he was never known to be in a passion. No worldly concerns (though he sometimes met with very trying ones) ever effected him. His humility rendered him invulne∣rable. When he was misrepresented and calumniated, he would say, "Our enemies are sometimes our best friends, and tell us truths; and then we should amend our faults, and be thankful for such informati∣on; and if what they say be not true, and only spoke through malice, then such per∣sons are to be considered as diseased in their minds, and we ought to pray for them. They are to be pitied," says he, "and I might as justly be angry with a man that is diseased in his body." In his ordinary transactions, with others, he was ever cheer∣ful, punctual, just, and candid, to persons of every denomination.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding these irrefragable proofs, that Mr. Hervey's opinions (even supposing some of them in their remote con∣sequences, were not altogether defensible) had no pernicious influence on so excellent
<PB N="35" REF="030558_0032_0FE7CA88CCA97868"/>a mind; it is but justice to add, that he guards against the abuses of the Antinomi∣ans, though he has himself been branded with that odious name.—Nay, some of his enemies have not scrupled to assert, "That his tenets were dishonourable to God, sub∣versive of all gospel-holiness, and destructive even of common morality, and very injuri∣ous to society itself, by making men melan∣choly and regardless of business".</P>
<P>These were the very words of an abusive and anonymous letter, sent to him by the post; on which that meek and excellent man observed to an intimate friend, with all his usual mildness, "Indeed this gentleman may be said, I think, to write at random.— Surely he has never read my works; if I knew where to direct to him, I should desire him to turn to what I have advanced, page 124, in the second volume of my Medita∣tions, and such a reply, I would hope, might convince him of his mistake."</P>
<P>Whatever vein of Calvanism runs through his writings, yet the weakening the obliga∣tions to purity and holiness of life, were the farthest imaginable, from his view: and when persons of judgment have pointed out to him such expressions as were liable to be misun∣derstood in that respect, he always disavow∣ed any such meaning, affirmed, that the
<PB N="36" REF="030558_0033_0FE7CA8E842C2550"/>fault was not in the evangelical doctrines, so much insisted on by him, but in the misap∣prchension, ignorance, or inattention of those who abused them to licentiousness.—He would then add, he was ready to alter or re∣tract any sentiment or expression, which he apprehended to be really objectionable; but that to make things equally clear to every one's apprehension, or to have the same ef∣fect upon every one's mind, was an imprac∣ticable attempt: for as the poet very justly observes,
<Q><L>"He who strives th'approbation of all to obtain.</L>
<L>"Shews a world of good nature, but labours in vain."</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE Rev. Mr. JAMES HERVEY's LIFE, WITH HIS CHARACTER, RESPECT<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>C BOTH HIS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CAPACITY.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the foregoing account of Mr. Hervey, it evidently appears he was a truly good man in life, as well as by <HI>profes∣sion</HI>; indeed I do not remember ever to have read, or conversed with any one concerning him, but what joined in acknowledging his title to the character and appellation of <HI>a real Christian.</HI></P>
<P>Those who differed from him in religious sentiments, could not but acknowledge that he wrote as became a man of true piety; and greatly esteemed him for that candour,
<PB N="38" REF="030558_0035_0FE7CA95D4C54A90"/>liberality of spirit, humility, and benevo∣lence to mankind in general, which so evi∣dently appeared in his publications. But as I find him portrayed in a late treatise, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Triumphs of Faith.</NOTE> in far more lively colours, and characterized in much better language than I would flatter myself master of, permit me to extract it, for the entertainment, satisfaction, and be∣nefit of my serious readers.</P>
<P>"A more diligent, distinguished and suc∣cessful labourer in the church of Christ, has perhaps seldom appeared; and in few characters was there ever a more happy conjunction of the gentleman, the scholar, and the Christian. The upright heart, the deep humility, under all his attainments, the warmest love to mankind in endeavours to promote their best interests, the most zea∣lous attachments to truth, the noblest de∣fence, as well as the daily practice of evan∣gelical holiness, the utmost serenity of mind under the most grievous afflictions, and a perfect resignation to the will of his hea∣venly Father, are a few of the outlines of his character, and justly represent him to have been a burning and shining light to the world. As a <HI>burning</HI> light, he warm∣ed many by his example, and as a <HI>shining</HI> light, he instructed many by his doctrine;
<PB N="39" REF="030558_0036_0FE7CA975FCDB170"/>he was a strenuous asserter of the free grace of God, taught men to be rich in good works, without placing the least dependance upon them; the Saviour was all in all to him, and a Redeemer's unsearchable riches it was his business and delight to publish. To bring sinners to Christ, as needy beg∣gars to buy wine and milk, without money and without price, was the constant aim of all his public ministrations as well as elegant writings; and it hath pleased God to make both remarkably successful, and him an in∣strument of turning many from the service of Satan to the living God. Oh, that they may become more and more so; and that many may be led by the spirit of all grace, to follow his steps, and go and do like∣wise! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The writer of this account appears to be not only a great admirer of Mr. Hervey, but a zealous advocate for his religi∣ous sentiments, as well as a sincere well wisher to the cause, and no indifferent scholar in the school of Christ, himself.</NOTE></P>
<P>When at school, Mr. Hervey was al∣ways remarked for genius and parts: and he there laid the foundation of that know∣ledge which has since gained him such uni∣versal esteem. Until the year 1733, howe∣ver, when he became acquainted with some persons distinguished for their serious im∣pressions of religion and zeal for its promoti∣on, he seems to have been (as in the phrase)
<PB N="40" REF="030558_0037_0FE7CA9D11741FD8"/>a <HI>moral</HI> man only. Some of his letters that are written from college, when he was not more than twenty, either speak a language very different from free grace, for which he was afterwards so powerful an advocate, or at least treat very confusedly of it. But be this as it may, the obscurity did not long continue: the Holy spirit soon opened his eyes to see the salvation of God. By the eye of faith he obtained and enjoyed clear views of it. He was able to act faith upon it: for his faith worked by love. The love of God was the glorious theme on which he dwelt; and the love of Christ his delightful song in this the house of his pilgrimage. This heart-felt love to God and Christ, ap∣peared in every part of his after conduct; as a minister, his faith wrought by love to the souls of men <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though the term <HI>faith</HI> is frequently mentioned here, the tautology, it is hoped, will not be disgusting, as it could not properly be avoided.</NOTE>; watching over his flock with peculiar care and assiduity; privately exhorting, and publicly calling and inviting them, with all the earnestness of a faithful ambassador of Jesus Christ, that they would turn and live:—as the master of a family, in the care of the souls of his domestics; in their reproof, instruction, and government; as a member of society, in good works to his neighbour: in charities to the poor, a∣bundant
<PB N="41" REF="030558_0038_0FE7CA9E9B671360"/><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His charity and benevolence to the poor and needy was truly exemplary, and deserving universal imitation, wherever God has given abilities and opportunity to exert it; a friend of Mr. Hervey's observes, his liberality was so diffusive, that at his death he left no more than 185. besides what would de∣fray the expence of his funeral.</NOTE> clothing the naked and feeding the hungry; informing the young, and sup∣porting the aged; in zeal for the salvation of all, fervent; desirous to be of some good to every person, and in every company, and of great good in many; a proof of which was the exemplary lives of such persons, their circumspect behaviour, and, in several instances, eminent piety:—as a private Christian, he was under the influ∣ence of the same faith working by love to the will of God. He walked close after Christ, and was himself a striking proof, that the belief of Christ's righteousness be∣ing imputed to him for his justification, was so far from a licentious doctrine, that it inspired him with the noblest motives to a grateful obedience; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Where true grace reigns in the heart, it will be evidenced by good works, in the life; saving faith, without works, is as impossible as the sun to shine without giving light.</NOTE> and his holy life was, in truth, the strongest recommendation of his principles. God had enriched him with great humility, as well as great gifts and graces. He was humbled by the power of grace. He had been a very vain, proud young man; but this emptied him of pride
<PB N="42" REF="030558_0039_0FE7CAA45A8FBE60"/>and self; and this clothed him with humi∣lity. —In his studies, the same principles of faith, working by love, was manifest: all was directed to the glory of God; all aim∣ed at the advancement of the Redeemer's kingdom: "Nulla dies sine linea; nulla epistola sine Christo," was his motto. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not a day without a line, or an epistle without something of Christ in it.</NOTE> <HI>Classical</HI> learning, for which he had a resined taste, and <HI>heathen</HI> authors, were in his lat∣ter years dropped, to make way for the more important study of the <HI>sacred scrip∣tures.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Search the scriptures, for therein <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e think ye have eternal life, and they are they which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sy of me, <HI>John v. 39.</HI></NOTE> These were his delight, and sweet∣er to him than the honey or the honey∣comb. They will be so to every one who reads them, as he did, with faith: for they are the power of God, and the wisdom of God unto salvation.</P>
<P>From these particulars, then, a judgment may be formed of this eminent character; but still more from the last scenes of life, and the glorious triumphs of his faith, in the hour of death. Its preciousness, indeed, never more appeared than at that time, by it he saw and apprehended the salvation of God, and rejoiced in the clearest views of his own interest in it. At this season,
<PB N="43" REF="030558_0040_0FE7CAA5E651AD58"/>when, as he himself writes, "little bodily rest could be got, and medicines gave no relief, the never failing cordial of the love of Christ was felt:
<Q><L>"Religion bears my spirits up:</L>
<L>A faithful and unchanging God</L>
<L>Lays the foundation for my hope,</L>
<L>In oaths, in promises, and blood."</L></Q>
Of his sentiments in such a season, the following extract from a letter to a friend, will give the full<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st and most amiable proof. It was wrote long before he left this world indeed; but it was wrote in the near pros∣pect of death from a severe and very vi∣olent illness.

<P>"A minister is a person of the greatest importance imagirable; his office is of the most universal concernment, and his de∣meanour therein of the most beneficial and prejudicial tendency; <HI>beneficial,</HI> if he be able,
<PB N="49" REF="030558_0046_0FE7CABBE6128560"/>faithful, and watches for the souls commit∣ted to his care, as one that must give an account; <HI>prejudicial,</HI> if he be unskilful, un∣active, and unconcerned about the spiritual welfare of his people. The things that pertain to salvation, and the means of ob∣taining everlasting life, are lodged in his hands. He is the steward of the mysteries of Christ, and so the guardian (under di∣vine grace) of your best and most abiding interests. If through ignorance he misma∣nage, or through idlenes neglect this weigh∣ty trust, it may be the ruin of immortal souls: whereas, if he be both discreet and diligent in his holy vocation, he may be the instrument of the richest benefits to those committed to his charge. His pray∣ing to God, and his preaching to them, may be attended with such a blessing from on high, as will fill them with heavenly wisdom, form them to true holiness, and fit them for the future glory. Benefits these not inconsiderable or momentary, but such as are great beyond all expression, and last∣ing to eternity.—A faithful minister of the everlasting gospel has a tolerable stock of knowledge. Though not enough to explain all mysteries, or to answer every perplexing question; yet sufficient to make himself and his hearers wise unto salvation. He may be ignorant of many things with∣out much disparagement to himself, or pre∣judice
<PB N="50" REF="030558_0047_0FE7CAC112A34550"/>to his people; but he must be ac∣quainted with, and able to teach others all that is necessary for them to know.—Se∣condly, He has not only some understanding, but some experience also in the ways of god∣liness. He has learnt to subdue, in some measure, the pride of his nature, and to be humble in his own eyes, and not fond of ap∣plause from others. He has broke the impetuosity of his passion, and generally pos∣sesses his soul in patience; or if upon some very ungrateful and provoking usage, he cannot calm his temper, yet he can curb his tongue; and though his spirit be russled, yet his words will be gentle. He is most commonly meek, after the manner of his blessed Master, and will always return bless∣ing for cursing, according to his holy com∣mand. He has often looked into the short∣ness of time, and the length of eternity; he has weighed the greatness and richness of heaven, with the insignificant and despica∣ble meanness of earth; and discovers such a mighty difference, as helps him to live a∣bove the world, even while he is in it. So that he is no lover of filthy lucre, no hunt∣er of carnal pleasures; but his hopes, his desires, and all his views of happiness are hid with Christ in God. He is courteous and condescending, and will stoop with the utmost cheerfulness to the lowest person in his parish. He will be affable and kind,
<PB N="51" REF="030558_0048_0FE7CAC409DF05F8"/>and seek to please, not himself, but his neighbours, for their good to edification. But you must not expect to find him tri∣fling or ludicrous; he will not preach to you on the Sunday, and play with you on the week-days, but carry the spirit of his ser∣mons into his ordinary conversation. He will maintain an uniform gravity of behavi∣our, without suffering it to be frozen into moroseness, or thawed into levity. He will love his parishioners, not for their agreeable persons or amiable qualities, but because they are redeemed by the blood of Christ. It will be his business and constant endea∣vour, I had almost said his meat and drink, to set forward their salvation. That by thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being made meet for the inheritance of the saints in light, his crucified Lord may see of the travel of his soul, and be sa∣tisfied. He will never forget the importu∣nate request of his Saviour, but those win∣ning and commanding words, "Feed my sheep, feed my lambs" will be engraven up∣on the tables of his heart. To fulfil this earnest request and execute this last charge of his dearest Redeemer, will be the fixed and invariable scope of all his designs. If at a∣ny time he hits this desirable mark, by bringing home to the fold any that have gone astray, he will be as glad as one that findeth great spoils.—To see the people of his care presisting in profaneness, sensua∣lity,
<PB N="52" REF="030558_0049_0FE7CAC9F3B457E8"/>and an unconverted state, will be the greatest grief that he feels: but to see his chil∣dren walking in the truth, mortifying their evil affections, and growing up in goodness as the calves of the stall, this will be his joy, and crown of rejoicing, better to him than thousands of silver and gold. It is his work to win souls, and by the former of these qua∣lifications, he is fitted for it, by the latter he is wholly devoted to it. And in order to prosecute it with the greater success, he will, first, take heed to himself, that his life be a fair and beautiful transcript of his doc∣trine, such as may remind men of, and be daily reinforcing his instructions. He will not bind the yoke upon your shoulders till he has wore it himself; and should the paths of religion prove ever so thorny, he will go first and beat the way. As far as human infirmities permit, he will strive to be un∣blamable and unreprovable, that he may re∣new the apostle's challenge, Be ye followers of me, even as I am of Christ. Secondly, his preaching will be plain; full of such use∣ful sense as may be edifying to the better learned, and yet delivered in so easy a man∣ner, as may be intelligible to the ignorant. It will not only be plain, but powerful also, if preceding prayers and tears, if words coming warm from the heart, and accompa∣nied with an ardent desire of being attend∣ed to; if to feel himself what he speaks, and
<PB N="53" REF="030558_0050_0FE7CACB83B003F8"/>so long that it may be felt by others, can make it such, he will declare the whole will of God, without withholding or min∣cing any. Be the truth ever so disagreea∣ble, contrary to your profits, or contrary to your pleasures, you will be sure to hear it. He will indeed show it in as lovely a light, and make it as palatable as he can, but no∣thing will prevail upon him to conceal or disguise it. Thirdly, he will not confine his teaching to God's day or house, but will exercise his care of you every day, and will bring it home to your own houses, whether you invite him or no. He will fre∣quently visit you, and for the same end as he meets you at church. Now, shall you like this part of his duty, or bid him wel∣come when he comes on such an errand? nay, he will think himself bound to pro∣ceed farther, and to enquire into the state of your souls, and your proceedings in your families; whether you are competently fur∣nished with saving knowledge? and are careful to increase it daily, by allowing a daily portion of your time for reading the scriptures? what virtues you are deficient in, what vices you are subject to? what e∣vil tempers, what vile affections, what un∣ruly passions, are predominant in you, and want to be suppressed? whether your chil∣dren are catechised, and your servants in∣structed? whether you are constant in fa∣mily
<PB N="54" REF="030558_0051_0FE7CAD0E5763D90"/>worship, and at your closet devotions? how you spend the Sabbath? whether you squander it away in impertinent visits, idle chat, or foolish jesting; or in holy discourse, reading and meditation? These, and other points of the like nature, he will examine into, and exhort you to amend what is a∣miss, no less than encourage you to perse∣vere in that which is good. Nor will he exhort you once or twice only, but again and again, and hardly leave off till he has won your consent. In things that relate to himself, he will be easily said nay; but when the great God insists upon obedience, and a blessed immortality will be lost by dis∣obedience, he will be instant in season, and out of season, he will solicit with unwearied applications the important cause, and press you to perform your duty, as the poor wi∣dow importuned the unjust judge to avenge her of her adversary; he will add to his ex∣hortations, reproofs: his eyes will be open, and his ears attentive to what passes in his parish; and when any one walks disorderly, he will meet with him as Elijah did Ahab, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1. Kings xxi. 20.</NOTE> with a rebuke in his mouth. This I can pro∣mise, that he will not rail at, nor accost you with reproachful words; but he will certainly set before you the things that you have done. He will not defame you behind your backs,
<PB N="55" REF="030558_0052_0FE7CAD31388C738"/>but whether you be rich or poor, whether you be pleased with it or not, he will bear in mind the commandment of the Lord, and "shew his people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah lviii. 1.</NOTE>" He will tell you with tenderness, but yet with plainness, that such courses are a sad and too sure a proof, that grace has not had its proper work on your souls, that ye are car∣nal, and have not the spirit of Christ. So that a true minister of the gospel will be a constant inspector of your actions, a faith∣ful monitor of your duty, and an imparti∣al reprover of your offences. He will guide you by his council, animate you by his ex∣ample, and bless you by his prayers."</P>
<P>In another letter, entitled "the Hope of Glory, a strong incitement to duty," Mr. Hervey breaks out in the following express∣ions, which seem to be the real language of his heart, and the pious breathings of a soul filled with love to God, and fervent zeal to promote his cause, interest and glo∣ry in the world.</P>
<P>"Oh that ministers may work for their dying Lord, while they have health; re∣membering that sickness may confine them to their chamber, and death will imprison
<PB N="56" REF="030558_0053_0FE7CAD8D73577A0"/>them in the grave. God Almighty give us courage that we may fight the good fight of faith and prudence, that we may not dis∣honour our high calling; 'ere long eternity will receive us, and then we shall rest from our labours, and forget our transient toils, amidst innumerable ages of perfection, glory, and joy."</P>
<P>The high esteem he had for, and the pleasure he experienced in the work of the ministry, may be gathered from the ensuing passages in a letter he wrote to one of his friends, on his taking up the sacred charac∣ter of an Ambassor of the King of Kings.</P>
<P>"I heartily congratulate you, my dear friend, my dear <HI>brother,</HI> I must call you now, on this change.

<P>This notion, you say, is absurd even to common sense.—A saying upon which I must beg leave to put a queery.

<P>To this judge I refer the cause.</P>
<P>And to open the cause a little, let me just observe; that God imputed <HI>our</HI> sins to his <HI>Son.</HI> Why else is it said? that, at his second coming he should appear <HI>without</HI> sin. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hebrews, iz 28.</NOTE> Plainly implying, that at his <HI>first</HI> coming, he appeared <HI>with</HI> sin; not indeed <HI>committed</HI> by him, but <HI>laid</HI> upon him, or im∣puted to him.</P>

How else could the immaculate Jesus be punished as the most inexcusable transgress∣or? "Awake, O sword, against the man that is my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zachariah, xiii. 7.</NOTE>" —Is not this the voice of a judge, pro∣nouncing the sentence, and authorising the execution? or rather, does it not describe the action of justice, turning the sword from us, and sheathing it in Christ?</P>
<P>If Christ, then, was our substitute, with re∣gard to penal suffering, why may he not stand in the same relation, with regard to justifying obedience? there is the same rea∣son for the one, as for the other. Every argument in favour of the former, is equally conclusive in behalf of the latter.</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> I freely grant, that Christ was punished in our stead; that his death is the expiation of our sin, and our security from penal suffering. But this—</P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI>—Will undeniably prove, that sin was imputed to him, otherwise he could not truly suffer in our stead, nor be justly pu∣nished at all. "And imputation is as rea∣sonable and justifiable in one case, as in the other; for they both stand upon one and the same foot, and for that reason, he who
<PB N="62" REF="030558_0059_0FE7CAEFB2750DA0"/>throws down one, throws down both."—I should by no means have interrupted my Theron, were it not to introduce this an∣swer from an eminent divine, who adds, what should be very seriously considered: "and therefore, whoever rejects the doctrine of the imputation of our Saviour's righteous∣ness to man, does by so doing, reject the im∣putation of man's sin to our Saviour, and all the consequences of it. Or in other words, he who rejects the doctrine of the imputation does, by so doing, reject the doctrine of the <HI>expiation</HI> likewise."</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> I know nothing of this Divine, and, eminent as he is, can hardly take his <HI>ipse dixet."</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> I was in hopes you would pay the greater regard to his opinion, because he is not in the number of the whimsical fa∣natics. —However, "say I these things as a man," or on man's authority alone? "saith not the law the same also?" speak∣ing of the peace-offering, the Holy Ghost has declared; "if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accept∣ed, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it." Hence we learn, that sacrisices and offerings, when duly admini∣stred, were imputed to the offerer; imputed
<PB N="63" REF="030558_0060_0FE7CAF143F8AD88"/>to him for reconcilation and peace with God. And wherefore? because they were figures of Christ, of his attonement and righteous∣ness; which, in like manner, are imputed to sinners for their pardon and salvation.</P>
<P>Lest you should think this proof being deduced from <HI>typical</HI> usages, not sufficient∣ly conclusive—I would farther observe, that the imputation of Christ's righteousness bears an evident analogy to another great and acknowledged truth of religion. We did not personally commit Adam's sin, yet are we chargeable with guilt, and liable to condemnation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romans, v. 12, 13.</NOTE>, on that—</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> How! we chargeable with guilt, and liable to condemnation, on account of Adam's transgression! this an acknowledg∣ed truth? No; it is a position I must deny, I had almost said, which I cannot but abhor. None other could, in the eye of justice and equity, be blamable for any offence of our first parents, but they only.</P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> So says Theron; but what says St. Paul? Your's may be the voice of natu∣ral reason, but what is the language of di∣vine revelation? in whom, that is in "Adam all have sinned." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. v. 12.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="030558_0061_0FE7CAF71FBBFA48"/>
<HI>Theron.</HI> The words, if I remember right, are— "for all that have sinned." Is it possible that <HI>Aspasio</HI> should forge the hand, or counterfeit the seal of the Holy Ghost, in order to establish a favourite notion?</P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> Impossible I hope.—In the mar∣gin, the words are translated as I have re∣peated.</P>
<P>In these words, the apostle assigns a rea∣son for the preceding assertion, "by one man's sin, death came upon all."—It might be replied, is not this strange? is not this un∣accountable? No; says our sacred dispu∣tant; we account for it on this principle, be∣cause "all have sinned."</P>
<P>This doctrine, that we all died in Adam, and were undone by his apostacy, cannot puz∣zle the simplest, if <HI>unprejudiced,</HI> mind; nor will it offend any, but the proud philoso∣pher, or the self-righteous moralist. And I assure you, I should not mention it, much less insist upon it, did it not subserve (and in a very singular manner) the purposes of <HI>edification.</HI> The doctrine of a Redeemer, obeying and dying in our stead, is the very hinge and centre of all evangelical revelati∣ons; is the very life and soul of all evange∣lical blessings. This doctrine is not a little
<PB N="65" REF="030558_0062_0FE7CAF8B862EBD8"/>illustrated, and comes very much recom∣mended by the imputation of Adam's sin. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romans, v. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>Contraries, you know, cast light upon, and set off each other. Winter and its se∣vere cold, make spring and its cheering warmth, more sensibly perceived, and more highly pleasing. Such an influence has the present subject, with respect to the vicari∣ous obedience of our Mediator. The more clearly we see the <HI>reality</HI> of the first, the more thoroughly we shall discern the expe∣diency, the excellency, and the glory of the last, the more we are humbled under conviction of the former, the more we shall court, or the more we shall triumph in the enjoyment of the latter <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">If the sinner is convinced of his liability or obnoxiousness" to eternal punishiment, from the guist of Adum's sin descending by generation upon him, as upon all mankind, the death of Christ as a sussicient atonement for <HI>original</HI> as well as <HI>actual</HI> trans∣gression, will appear the more valuable, and accordingly be more highly prized.</NOTE>. The apostle draws a long parallel, or rather forms a strong contrast between them, in the fifth chapter to the <HI>Romans..</HI> He speaks copiously of A∣dam's guilt, imputed to all mankind for con∣demnation and death, that he may speak the more acceptably, the more charmingly of Christ's righteousness, imputed to all belie∣vers for justification and life.

<P><HI>Theron.</HI> It really seems to me a thing <HI>impossible,</HI> that one man's righteousness should be made anothers. Can one man live by the soul of another? or be learned by the learning of another? Good Aspasio, never attempt to maintain such palpable absurdi∣ties. They will only expose christianity to the scorn of infidels.</P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> If infidels scoff at this comfort∣able truth, their scoffing will be like their other cavils, not the <HI>voice</HI> of reason, but the clamour of prejudice.</P>
<P>My friend's objection insinurates what we never assert: that the righteousness of Christ is <HI>transfused</HI> into believers, which would, doubtless, be in fact, impossible, as it is in theory absurd. But this we disavow, as stre∣nuously as you can oppose. The Redeem∣er's righteousness is made ours, not by <HI>infu∣sion,</HI> but by <HI>imputation.</HI> The very terms we use may acquit us from such a ridiculous charge; as imputation signifies, "a placing to the account of one what is done or suffer∣ed by another," Accordingly we believe, that the righteousness which justifies abides
<PB N="67" REF="030558_0064_0FE7CB002C93B288"/>in Christ, but is placed to our account: that Christ, and Christ alone, actually perfor∣med it: that Christ, and Christ alone, per∣sonally possesses it: but that performing it in our stead, and possessing it as our cove∣nant-head, God imputes it to us. God ac∣cepts us for it—accepts us as much, as if we had, on our own behalf, and in our persons, severely fulfilled it.</P>
<P>Though one man cannot live, be actuated with a principle of life; <HI>by the soul</HI> of another; yet you must allow, that one man, nay, that many men may live, be continued in the possession of life, for the righteousness of ano∣ther: or else you must do what I am sure you abhor.—You must charge with absurdi∣ty and impossibility, even the declaration of Jehovah himself; "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then will I spare all the place for their sakes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Genesis, xviii. 26.</NOTE>" When your worthy minister was disabled, by a rheumatic disorder, from attending on the business of his function, several of the neighbouring cler∣gy gave him their assistance: was he not by this <HI>vicarious</HI> performance of his office, <HI>inti∣tled</HI> to all the profits of his living? It seems therefore, not so unexampled a thing, for one person to act in another's stead. And when a service is thus discharged by the

<P>Did not Jehu's descendants, even to the fourth generation, reap the advantage of their great-grandfather's zeal <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Kings, x. 20.</NOTE>? does not the Duke of—enjoy the honours and rewards won by the sword of a victoriousan∣cestor? and may not the whole world of be∣lievers, with equal, with far greater justice, receive life and salvation on account of their all-deserving Saviour?—especially since he and they are one <HI>mystical</HI> body, represented as such in scripture, and considered as such by God.</P>
<P>No, say you: "this is contrary to the rules of distributive justice."—What is your idea of a <HI>surety?</HI> how was the affair stated, and how were matters negociated, with re∣lation to your generous acquaintance Phi∣lander? he, you know, was bound for an un∣fortunate brother who lately stepped aside.</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> The debt, by his brother's ab∣sconding, devolved upon Philander. He was responsible for all, and obliged to pay the whole sum.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="030558_0066_0FE7CB078E62D4B0"/>
<HI>Aspasio.</HI> Was not his payment as satis∣factory to the creditor, as if the money had been paid in the debtor's own person, by the debtor's own hand?</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> Certainly.</P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> Was not the debtor by this vi∣carious payment, released from all fear of prosecution, and acquitted from any future demand on this score?</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> He was.</P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> Apply this instance to the re∣demption of sinner's by Jesus Christ, who is in the sacred writings expressly stiled a surety*.—If Philander's act was deemed, in the estimation of law, the act of his bro∣ther; if the deed of the former was imput∣ed, in point of advantage, entirely to the latter, why should not the same effects take place, with regard to the divine bondsman, and poor insolvent sinners? why should that be exploded in our system of divinity, which is universally admitted in our courts of justice?</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> Obedience and righteousness are, in the nature of the things themselves, <HI>personal</HI> qualities, and <HI>only</HI> so. Every man
<PB N="70" REF="030558_0067_0FE7CB0D547190F8"/>is that only (and can be nothing else) which he is in himself.</P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> Righteousness, as <HI>dwelling</HI> in us, is undoubtedly a personal quality.

But does this supercede the necessity, or destroy the existence of <HI>imput∣ed</HI> righteousness?—Your first proposition is ambiguous. Let it speak distinctly; add in∣herent to your righteousness, and the sense becomes determinate, but the argument falls to the ground.</P>
<P>"Every man is that only (and can be no∣thing else) which he is in himself."—if I had never seen the Bible, I should have yielded my ready assent to his proposition. But when I open the Old Testament, and find it written by the prophet; "In the Lord shall all the house of Israel be justified. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah, xlv. 25.</NOTE>" When I turn to the New Testament, and hear the apostle saying," ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principalities and pow∣ers <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Colossians, ii. 10.</NOTE>:" I cannot concur with Theron, with∣out contradicting the revelation. Israel, or the true believer, is said to be justified; and the foundation of this blessing is declared to be, not in <HI>himself,</HI> but in the Lord. The Colossians are said to be complete, which,
<PB N="71" REF="030558_0068_0FE7CB0EDE636370"/>we are very certain they were not in them∣selves; and are expressly assured they were so in Christ. Hence it appears quite con∣trary to my friend's assertion, that sinners both <HI>have</HI> and <HI>are</HI> that in Christ, which they neither have nor are in themselves. They have, by imputation a <HI>righteousness</HI> in Christ; they are, by this imputed righteousness, <HI>com∣plete</HI> before God.</P>
<P>I believe your mistake proceeds from ne∣glecting to distinguish between inherent and imputed.—We never suppose that a prosane person is devout, or an intemperate person sober. To live soberly and act devoutly is <HI>inherent</HI> righteousness. But we maintain, that the profane and intemperate, being con∣vinced of their inquiity, and betaking them∣selves to the all-sufficient Saviour for re∣demption, are interested in the merit both of his life and of his death.—This is <HI>impu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed</HI> righteousness—We farther affirm, that though criminal in themselves, they are made righteous in Christ, and are accepted by God for his beloved Son's sake. This is <HI>justification,</HI> though imputed righteous∣ness.</P>
<P>Neither is this a precarious or unwarrant∣able opinion, but the clear and positive de∣claration of scripture. <HI>He justifieth,</HI> he ab∣solves from guilt, he treats us as righteous.
<PB N="72" REF="030558_0069_0FE7CB149B333220"/><HI>Whom?</HI> upright, obedient, sinless creatures; this were nothing extraordinary—no; but "he justifieth the ungodly that believe in the Lord Jesus," <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romans, iv. 5</NOTE> imputing, as the ground of this justification, <HI>their</HI> trespasses to him, and <HI>his</HI> righteousness to them; this is di∣vinely gracious indeed! <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cor. v. 19, 21.</NOTE></P>
<P>I am persuaded that multitudes in the gay and licentious world are held fast in the <HI>fatal</HI> snare of sin and carnal security, by their ig∣norance of this sweet, alluring, consolatory truth: they find themselves deeply obnoxi∣ous to divine justice, and feel themselves strongly bound with the chains of sensuality. They think it is impossible to clear the en∣ormous score of their guilt, impossible to de∣liver themselves from the confirmed domi∣nion of sin. Therefore, like desperate debt∣ors, they stifle every serious thought, least a consciousness of their long arrears, and a prospect of the dreadful reckoning should torment them before the time <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. viii. 29.</NOTE> But if they were informed, that the infinitely merciful Son of God has undertaken to redeem such undone and helpless sinners: That he has thoroughly expiated the most horrid trans∣gressions, and procured, even for ungodly

<P>Yes, my friend, these truths, if once re∣vealed and received in their hearts, would be an infallible method to make them free <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John, viii. 32.</NOTE></P>
<P>God the father is well pleased with this righreousness of our Redeemer. He ex∣presses his complacency by the most empha∣tical words: behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my soul de∣lighteth, viz. in Christ and his righteous∣ness. God is not only pleased, but delight∣ed: his very soul, every perfection of the godhead, with ineffable satisfaction, rests and acquiesces in them. Our Lord Jesus Christ is well pleased. He esteems it his honour to shine forth as the everlasting righ∣teousness of his people. It is the brightest jewel of his mediatorial crown.</P>
<P>In this he sees the travel of his soul, and is satisfied <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isaiah, liii. 11.</NOTE>; accounting himself fully recom∣pensed
<PB N="74" REF="030558_0071_0FE7CB1BE5154D28"/>pensed for all the labours of his life, and all the sorrows of his death, when sinners are washed from their guilt in his blood, and presented faultless by his obedience.</P>
<P>The holy Spirit is equally pleased with this great transaction, and its matchless ef∣fects; it is his peculiar office and favourite employ to convince the world of the fullness and efficacy of their Saviour's righteousness.</P>
<P>Since then this method of acceptance and salvation is excellent and glorious in the eyes of the adorable Trinity—since it magnifies the law, and yields the most exalted hon∣ours to its divine Author—since it makes ample provision for the holiness of a cor∣rupt, and the happiness of a ruined world, why should my friend any longer dislike it, oppose it, or treat it with a cold indifference?</P>
<P>Surely all these grand recommendations are enough to over-rule any little objecti∣ons, which may crise from the suspicions of timidity, or be started by the artifices of so∣phistry and cunning.</P>
<P>It is very probable I may meet with af∣flictions; death in my family, or disease in my person; disappointments may frustrate my designs; Providence may wear a frown∣ing aspect; as though the Lord had a con∣troversy
<PB N="75" REF="030558_0072_0FE7CB1D70A59918"/>with his sinful creature, and was causing him to possess the iniquities of his youth; and what will be sufficient to sup∣port and cheer in such a gloomy hour? no thing but the "righteousness of Jesus Christ."</P>
<P>Nothing is sovereign to clam our fears, and remove all apprehensions of the Divine wrath, or to draw the curtains of horror from around our sick beds, and throw our lan∣guishing eye-lids off the gloom of the sha∣dow of death, as a believing improvement of the imputed righteousness of our dear Re∣deemer: this clears up the mournful scene, and takes away the sting of tribulation and distress.</P>
<P>Attending to this great propitiation, the sufferer sees his sins forgiven, and his God reconciled; from whence he concludes, that the severest afflictions are only fatherly cor∣rections, and shall not exceed his ability to bear, and shall assuredly obtain a graci∣ous issue. He can fetch comfort from that cheering word, "I will be with him, and bring him to honour" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xci. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P>These supports have enabled the saints to kiss the rod, and bless the hand which chas∣tised them. To possess their souls, not in
<PB N="76" REF="030558_0073_0FE7CB233299ACA0"/>patience only, but in thankfulness also. While they have looked inward, and discern∣ed their absolute need of these bitter but sa∣lutary medicines, they have looked upward, and beheld the cup in a most wise and ten∣der physician's hand: have looked forward, with a joyful hope, to that better world, where God will wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more sorrow, nor any more pain for ever.</P>
<P>The last occasion of need is the trying hour of death, and the tremendous day of judgment. Will this righteousness carry us with safety through the darksome valley, and present us with acceptance at the dread∣ful tribunal?—It will: it will.—This silen∣ces all the curses of the law, and disarms death of every terror.</P>
<P>To believe in this righteousness, is to meet death at our Saviour's side, or rather, like good old Simeon, with the Saviour in our arms.—They overcame, says the belov∣ed disciple, they overcame the last enerny, not by natural fortitude, or philosophic re∣solution, but by the blood of the Lamb <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xii. ii.</NOTE>. By that grand price of redemption which cost the Redeemer every drop of his blood: which delivers sinners from the wrath to

<P><HI>Theron.</HI> I know not how it is, Aspasio; but I cannot reconcile myself to this doc∣trine of "imputed righteousness:" not with∣stan ling all the pains you have taken to make me a convert.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="030558_0075_0FE7CB2AB0247298"/>
<HI>Aspasio.</HI> The disappointment is mine, but the less is your's, Theron.—However, let me entreat you not to reject my senti∣ments absolutely, nor to condemn them pre∣maturely. Suppose it possible, at least, that they <HI>may</HI> be true, and weigh them in an e∣ven balance.—Learn wisdom from your A∣spasio's folly. I was once exactly in your si∣tuation, saw things in your light, and through your medium.</P>
<P>Conversing (I well remember) with a de∣vout but plain person, our discourse hap∣pened to turn on the solemn admonition; "if any man will come after me, let him de∣ny himself." I was haranging upon the import and extent of the duty; shewing, that merely to forbear the infamous action, is little. We must deny admittance, deny entertainment at least to the evil imagination, and quench even the kindling spark of irre∣gular desire.—When I had shot a random bolt, my honest friend replied, "There is a∣nother instance of selfdenial, to which this in∣junction extends, and which is of very great moment in the christian religion; I mean the instance of renouncing our own strength, and our own righteousness, not leaning on <HI>that</HI> for holiness, nor relying on <HI>this</HI> for justification." I thought the old man, I must confess, little better than a su∣perstitious dotard; and wondered at (what
<PB N="79" REF="030558_0076_0FE7CB2C3A8B9C20"/>I then fancied) the motley mixture of piety and oddity in his notions. But now I dis∣cern sense, solidity, and truth in his observa∣tion. Now I perceive that we ourselves are often the dreamers, when we imagine o∣thers to be fast a sleep.</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> You have no reason to be a∣shamed Aspasio, of receiving instruction from your honest counsellor.</P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> But still "you cannot reconcile yourself." And no wonder. For this way of salvation runs directly counter to the stream of corrupt nature. It puzzles our reason, and offends our pride.—"What! shall we not work, but <HI>believe unto righteousness?</HI> shall we receive all <HI>freely,</HI> and reckon ourselves no better than <HI>unprofitable</HI> servants? having no∣thing whatsoever that may recommend us to our Maker." This is a method to which we should never submit; this is a proposal which we should always spurn, were not our natural sentiments rectified, and our high imaginations abased by the power of di∣vine grace.</P>
<P>Let me remind you of a little incident which you must have read in the Grecian history: a certain stranger came one day to dine with some Lacedemonians, who always sat down at a public table, and were content
<PB N="80" REF="030558_0077_0FE7CB31E63B9130"/>with the plainest sood, the gentleman ac∣customed to higher eating, could not for∣bear expressing his disgust at the <HI>homely</HI> pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ision. —Sir, said the cook, you do not make use of the <HI>sauce.</HI>—What do you mean? re∣plied the guest.—You do not use hard ex∣ercise, nor habituate vourself to long absti∣nence, nor bring a sharpened appetite to the meal.—And you, my dear friend, I am apprehensive, have not the sauce, have not the proper preparative for this salutary doc∣trine, which is indeed the bread of life, and the very marrow of the gospel.</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> What preparative? Did you not just now say that all was free, and no∣thing needful, but only to receive the bles∣sing?</P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> True; nothing is needful, as in∣clining God to give, but only as inclining us to receive.—Would you seek, would you solicit, would you so much as accept a par∣don from your sovereign, unless you stood convicted of some capital crime, or was ap∣parently liable to condemnation? neither will sinful man seek, no, nor <HI>accept</HI> the great attonement, till he is made sensible that the wrath of God and the damnation of hell are what he justly deserves, and what, without the propitiation of Christ, he must unavoida∣bly suffer</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="030558_0078_0FE7CA12924E0518"/>
This, then, is the preparative.—A sense of the horrible silthiness of the least sin in the sight of God; of the innumerable sins of our heart and life, and our undone damnable state on this account.—While <HI>destitute</HI> of these convictions, our souls will be like the full stomach, that loathes even the honey∣comb. So long as these convictions are <HI>slight,</HI> and <HI>hover</HI> only in the imagination; we shall be like Gallio, listless, indifferent, and "caring for none of those things."—But when they are <HI>deep</HI> and <HI>peneirate</HI> the heart, then the righteousness of a Redeemer will be sweet, tasteful, and inviting. Sweet as myrrh and srankincense to the smell; taste∣ful as milk and honey to the palate; in∣viting as gold and treasures to the ruined bankrupt.</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> How are these convictions wrought in the soul?</P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> "By the law is the knowledge of sin." Consequently, by the law is the conviction of our undone state. Let us therefore endeavour to understand the law of God how pure, how extensive, how sublime∣ly perfect it is.—Then, judge of our spiritual condition, not from the <HI>flattering</HI> suggesti∣ons of self-love, nor from the <HI>defective</HI> ex∣amples of our fellow creatures, but by this <HI>unerring</HI> standard of the sanctuary.—Above
<PB N="82" REF="030558_0079_0FE7CB392031D628"/>all, let us beseech the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to send his enlightening spirit into our hearts: for indeed, without enlightening influences of the spirit, we may have the divine law in our hand; we may comprehend its grammatical meaning; yet be like blind Bartimeus under the meri∣dian sun. It is the blessed spirit alone who can remove the veil of ignorance from our minds; and shew us either "the wonderful things of God's law," or the glorious mys∣teries, of his gospel. In this sense, our po∣lite poet speeks a truth, as singularly impor∣portant as it is elegantly expressed:
<Q><L>"He from thick films shall purge the visual ray,</L>
<L>"And on the sightless eye-balls pour the day."</L></Q></P>
<P>Will you give me leave to propose ano∣ther expedient, which, I believe, may be considerably serviceable in this particular case. Which I am assured, will be greatly advantageous in many other respects.</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> Backward as I am to adopt your doctrine, I am no enemy to my own interest; therefore, shall not only give you leave to propose, but give you thanks for communicating so valuable an advice.</P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> It is, in reality, none of mine. It was long ago recommended by our old ac∣quaintance Horace. It consists in <HI>keeping a diary.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="030558_0080_0FE7CB3AA9E07198"/>
Compile a secret history of your heart and conduct.—Take notice of the manner in which your <HI>time</HI> is spent, and of the strain which runs through your <HI>discourse.</HI> How often the former is lost in trifles, how often the latter evaporates in vanity. At∣tend to the <HI>principle</HI> from which your acti∣ons flow; whether from the steady habitual love of God, or from some rambling im∣pulse, 02 and a customary propensity to please yourself.—Minute down your sins of <HI>omissi∣on</HI>; how frequently you neglect to glorify your Creator, to edify your fellow crea∣tures; and to improve yourself in know∣ledge and holiness. Observe the frame of your spirit in <HI>religious</HI> duties; with what re∣luctance they are undertaken, and with what indevotion performed; with how many wanderings of thought, and with how much dullness of desire. How often, in transact∣ing <HI>commen</HI> affairs, you feel the inordinate sallies of passion, the workings of evil con∣cupiscence, or the intrusion of foolish ima∣ginations.</P>
<P>Register those <HI>secret</HI> faults, to which none but your own conscience is privy, and which none but the all-seeing eye discerns. Often review these interesting memoirs; frequent∣ly contemplate yourself in this faithful mir∣ror, and do not be afraid to see your wants and weaknesses, the depravity of your heart,
<PB N="84" REF="030558_0081_0FE7CB406C6CB9F8"/>and the iniquity of your life.—An artist, some time ago, took a survey of your estate; drew the form, and measured the dimensi∣ons of each enclosure; pictured out every hedge, and scarce omitted a single tree which grew upon the premises.—Act this with your will, your understanding, and your affections.</P>
<P>By this means we shall discover the sins which most easily beset us, which most fre∣quently elude our vigilance, and baffle our resolution. We shall learn <HI>how</HI> to post our guard, <HI>when</HI> to exercise the strictest watch, and <HI>where</HI> to direct the artillery of prayer. —In a word, we shall learn better than from ten thousand volumes, to know ourselves. A knowledge which was supposed, by the ancient philosophers, to descend from hea∣ven, and which, I believe, our christian divines will allow, has a happy tendency to lead people thither; because, of all other preparatives, it best disposes them for that blessed Redeemer, who is the way, the on∣ly way to those blissful mansions.</P>
<P>Now I have mentioned a <HI>way,</HI> let me suppose you travelling through an unknown country: you came to a place where the road divides itself into two equally inviting parts. You are at a loss which track to pursue. Whose direction will you choose
<PB N="85" REF="030558_0082_0FE7CB41F7EAD5A8"/>to follow? that man's who has passed thro', <HI>neither</HI> of them? that man's who has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> through <HI>one</HI> of them only? or that man's who has passed and repassed them <HI>both</HI>? To wait for an answer would be an affront to your judgment: only let me observe, that the last is your Aspasio's case. He has tra∣velled long, and proceeded far, even in <HI>your</HI> path. All that circumspection and affidui∣ty, all that prayer and self-denial, all that fasting and alms, and every other means of grace could do, in order to establish a righ∣teousness of his own, has been done.—But to no purpose.—He has also trod every step in the way, which he recommends to his beloved friend. He has made the trial con∣cerning the righteousness <HI>without works,</HI> or the righteousness of God imputed. He can set his <HI>probatum est</HI> to whatsoever he advises on this subject, and may venture to say, with his divine MASTER, "we speak that we do know," and testify that we have ex∣perienced.</P>
<P><HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.</HI> I am sorry to observe that the night <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> coming on, and our conversation almost at an end. My regret is increased by the consideration of your intended jour∣ney. —Though business obliges you to <HI>depart,</HI> it will I hope, afford you leisure to <HI>write.</HI> This will be some compensation for the want of your company.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="030558_0083_0FE7CB47BB943668"/>
Yonder sun is sinking below the horizon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taking his leave of our earth. To retard the departing radiance, at least to al∣leviate the approaching loss those western clouds catch the rays, and reflect them to our view in a most amusing diversity of colours. By this means we enjoy the great luminary in his <HI>beams,</HI> even when <HI>his orb</HI> is withdrawn from our sight. An epistolary correspon∣dence has something of the same nature. Letters may be called the talk of absent friends. By this expedient, they communi∣cate their thoughts, even though countries, kingdoms, or seas intercept their speech. You must, therefore, pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mise me this satis∣faction, that I may converse with my Aspa∣sio by the <HI>pen,</HI> when I can no longer have an intercourse with him in <HI>persin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> You have anticipated me, The∣ron; otherwise, what is now my promise, would have been my request.</P>
<P>I cannot but take notice of another parti∣cularity in that magnificent affemblage of clouds; how they varied their appearance, as the lamp of day changed its situation.— A little while ago, those curtains of the sky were streaked with orange, or tinged with amber. Presently they borrow the blush of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose, or the softened red of the pink. 'Ere long, they glow with vermillion, or
<PB N="87" REF="030558_0084_0FE7CB494BFD84E0"/>deepen into crimson. Soon succeed the purple, more beautiful and grand th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny imperial robe, and as soon (thus transient is all sublunary grandeur!) gives place to the <HI>sable veil</HI> of evening, or saddens into the <HI>gloomy pall</HI> of night. Such I trust, will be the issue of my Theron's present apprehen∣sions. All his splendid ideas of human ex∣cellency and self-righteousness will become faint, will lose their imaginary lustre, till at length they fade away, and darken into ab∣solute <HI>self-abasement.</HI>—Then the grace of free justification will be amiable, will be de∣sirable as the beauties of the dawn, breaking upon the shades of night. Then you will make no difficulty to say with the Psalmist and the Apostle, "Blessed is the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Romans, iv. 6.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>Oh, my Theron! what is the drop of a bucket to the unfathomable waves of the ocean? what is a grain of sand to the un∣measureable dimensions of the universe? what is an hour or a moment to the endless revolutions of eternity? such are all human endowments and temporary attainments, compared with his righteousness, who "thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet took on him the form of a servant?
<PB N="88" REF="030558_0085_0FE7CB4F0F11D960"/>who was made sin for us who knew no sin, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might be made the righteousness of God in him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">a Cor. v. 21.</NOTE>?" —And is this righteousness designed for <HI>us?</HI> Is this to be our wedding dress, this our beautiful array, when we enter the regions of eternity? Unspeakable pri∣vilege! —Is this what God has provided to supply, and more than supply our loss in Adam? Boundless benignity!—Shall <HI>we</HI> be treated by the Judge of the world, as if we had performed all this unsinning and per∣fect obedience? well might the prophet cry cut, like one lost in astonishment, "how great is his goodness!" How great indeed! since all that the Lord Jesus <HI>did and suffered,</HI> was done and suffered for us men, and for our salvation, "is imputed unto us for righ∣teousness," and is the cause, the sole but infi∣nitely sufficient cause of our justification.</P>
<P>Is not your heart enamoured, my dear Theron, with a view of this incomprehensibly rich grace? what so excellent, what so comfortable, what so desirable as the gist of a Saviour's righteousness? though delineat∣ed by this <HI>feeble</HI> pen, methinks it has glory and dignity enough to captivate our hearts, and fire our affections; fire them with ar∣dent and distinguishable desires after a per∣sonal interest and propriety in it.—O! may
<PB N="89" REF="030558_0086_0FE7CB509A8DF940"/>the eternal Spirit reveal our Redeemer's righteousness, in all its heavenly beauty and divine lustre! then, I am persuaded, we shall esteem it above <HI>every thing</HI>; we shall regard it as the <HI>one thing</HI> needful; we shall count <HI>all things</HI> in comparison of it, worthless as the chaff, and empty as the wind.</P>
<P>But here sinners may "suck and be satisfi∣ed with this breast of consolation;" yea, millions and thousands of millions "may milk out and be delighted with the abun∣dance of its glory."—Here we shall find the doctrine of supererogation, no longer a chi∣mera, but a delightful reality. Here, indeed, is an immense surplusage, an inexhaustible fund of merit, sufficient to enrich a whole world of indigent and miserable creatures; sufficient to make their cup run over with a superabundant fulness of peace and joy, so long as time shall last, and when time shall be no more. For to use the apostle's weighty argument, "if by one man's offence, death reigned by one; much more they which re∣ceive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by me", Je∣sus Christ. Is it reasonable that we should ascribe more power to Adam, a mere man, in making us sinners, than in Christ, the GOD-MAN, in making us righteous? No verily. If <HI>one</HI> offence, committed by one man, made all his posterity chargeable with
<PB N="90" REF="030558_0087_0FE7CB5655A47378"/>guilt, and liable to death, MUCH MORE shall the <HI>manifold</HI> instances of our <HI>divine</HI> Redeem∣er's obedience absolve all his people from condemnation and punishment, and intitle them to the honours and joys immortali∣ty.</P>
<P>Think not that what I have written is the language of rant; it is a paraphrase, though I must confess, but a scanty paraphrase, on David's practice, and David's faith; "My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day, for I know not the numbers thereof." The supereminent righteousness of Christ, and the great salva∣tion obtained thereby, he declares, shall be the chosen, the principal subject of his dis∣course; not on a sabbath only, but on <HI>eve∣ry day</HI> of the week, of the year, of his life: not barely at the stated returns of solemn devotion; but on every common occasion, in every social interview, <HI>all the day long.</HI> Why will he thus dwell, perpetually and invariably dwell, on this darling theme? because, "he knew not the numbers there∣of." It is impossible to measure the value, or exhaust the fullness of these blessings. The righteousness is unspeakable, the salva∣is everlasting. To compute the duration of the one, numbers fail; to describe the excellency of the other, words are at a loss.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="030558_0088_0FE7CB57E06AA138"/>
This will appear in a clearer light, if, to the perfection of his obedience, we add the <HI>majesty</HI> of our Saviour's <HI>person.</HI>—Let me de∣sire my friend, the friend of my bosorn, to contemplate our Lord Jesus under that lovely and august character, CLORIOUS IN HOLINESS. And, for my part, I will not cease to pray, that a sense of this supere∣minently grand and precious righteousness may be written on my Theoron's heart.— On those living tables, may it be like figures cut on a rock of solid marble, or inscribed on the bark of a solid tree; be <HI>lasting</HI> in its duration as the former, and <HI>spreading</HI> in its influence as the latter; and it will then be a sure proof that his name is written in the book of life.</P>
<P>You give a most astonishing account of the <HI>pressure</HI> of-the atmosphere. Astonish∣ing indeed! that we should be continually surrounded, continually overwhelmed with such a load of air; quite dreadful to think upon! yet not be crushed to death; no, nor be sensible of the least weight.—This, I think, may serve to represent the state of sinners, <HI>unawakened</HI> from carnal security. Loads, more than <HI>mountainous</HI> loads of guilt, are upon his soul, and he perceives not the burden. For this reason, he is under no apprehensions of the vengeance and fiery indignation which he deserves; he has no
<PB N="92" REF="030558_0089_0FE7CB5DA74BAD58"/>superlative esteem for the attonement and merits of the Redeemer, which alone can deliver him from the wrath to come; but if once his conscience <HI>feels</HI> what his lips, perhaps, have often repeated, "we do ear∣nestly repent us of these our misdoings; the remembrance of them is grievous unto us, the burden of them intolerable;" then how will he prize such a text; "The Lord laid on Christ the iniquity of us all:" how will he long for an interest in the Lamb of God, "which taketh away the sin of the world!" then that Jesus, who has finished the transgression, and brought in everlasting righteousness, will be all his salvation, and all his desire.</P>
<P>That Mr. Hervey was a great admirer of the charms of rural nature, and closely studied the beauties of her sylvan retreats, may be readily proved by his choice of, and attachment to the silent recesses of the country, and his picturesque descriptions of them in various parts of his admired writ∣ings: the beginnings of his Meditations, Contemplations and Dialogues, plainly evi∣dence his taste and genius, especially for rural and luxuriant paintings; the following extracts from the aforementioned dialogues will, I doubt not, be very acceptable to all who are fond of romantic and sequestered scenes.</P>

<HEAD>DESCRIPTIVE BEAUTIES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THERON'S EXTENSIVE GARDENS.</HEAD>
<P>THE spot adjoining to the house was appropriated to the cultivation of <HI>flowers</HI>—In a variety of handsome com∣partments were assembled the choicest beau∣ties of blooming nature. Here the <HI>hya∣cinth</HI> hung her silken bells, or the <HI>lillies</HI> rear∣ed their silver pyramids. There stood the neat <HI>narcissus,</HI> loosely attired in a mantle of snowy lustre, while the splendid <HI>ranunculus</HI> wore a full trimmed suit of radiant scarlet. <HI>Pinks</HI> were rising to enamel the borders; <HI>roses</HI> were opening to dress the walks, surround∣ed on all sides with a profusion of beauteous forms, either latent in the stalk, or bursting the buds, or blown into full expansion.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="030558_0091_0FE7CB64EBBB5BB8"/>
This was bounded by a slight partition: a fort of verdant parapet, through which they descended by an easy flight of steps, and are presented with the elegant simpli∣city of the <HI>kitchen-garden.</HI>—In one place you might see the marygold flowering, or the beans in blossom. In another the en∣dive curled her leaves, or the lettuce thick∣ened her tufts. Cauliflowers sheltered their fair complexion under a green umbrella, while the borage dishevelled her locks, and braided them with native jewels of a finer than the finest sapphires.—On the <HI>sunny stopes,</HI> the cucumber and melon lay basking in the collected beams. On the <HI>raised beds</HI> the artichoke seemed to be erecting a stand∣ard, while the asparagus shot into ranks of spears. The <HI>level ground</HI> produced all man∣ner of cooling sallads and nourishing escu∣lents; which, like the brows of the <HI>Olym∣pic</HI> conquerors, were bound with a fillet of unfading parsley; or, like the pictures of the mountain nymphs, were graced with a chaplet of fragrant marjoram.—In short, nothing was wanting to furnish out the wholesome luxury of an <HI>antediluvean</HI> ban∣quet.</P>
<P>Soon a high wall intervenes, through which a wicket opens, and transmits them into the regular and equidistant rows of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>orchard.</HI>—This plantation is so nicely ad∣justed,
<PB N="95" REF="030558_0092_0FE7CB6677B19180"/>that it looks like an arrangement of rural piazzas, or a collection of diversified vistas. The eye is every where entertained with the exactest uniformity, and darts, with unobstructed ease, from one end of the branching files to the other. On all the boughs lay a lovely evolution of <HI>blossoms,</HI> arrayed in milky white, or tinged with the softestred; crouding into one general clus∣ter, without relinquishing a vacant space for leaves, they formed the fairest, the gayest, the grandest alcove that fancy itself can ima∣gine.—It is really like the Court of Grac∣es; none can approach it, without sinding his ideas brightened, and feeling his temper exhilirated.</P>
<P>Contiguous to this correct disposition of things, nature has thrown a <HI>wilderness,</HI> hoa∣ry, grotesque, and magnificently confused. It stretched itself with a large circular sweep to the north, and secured both the olitory and the orchard from incommoding winds. Copses of hazel and flowering shrubs filled the lower spaces, while poplars quivered aloft in the air, and pines pierced the clouds with their leafy spires. Here grew clumps of fir, clad in everlasting green; there stood groves of oak, which had weathered for ag∣es the wintry storm.—This woody theatre was intersected by a <HI>winding walk,</HI> lined with elms of an insuperable height, whose
<PB N="96" REF="030558_0093_0FE7CB6C4BC91AE8"/>branches, uniting at the top, reared a majes∣tic arch, and projected a solemn shade. It was impossible to enter this losty labyrinth, without being struck with a pleasing dread. As they proceed, every inflexion diffuses a deeper gloom, and awakens a more pensive attention.</P>
<P>Having strolled in this darksome avenue, without a speck of sunshine, without a glimpse of the heavens; on a sudden, they step into open day.—Surprising! cries As∣pasio, what a change is this! what a delight∣ful enchantment is here!—One instant whelmed in Trophonius's cave, where darkness lours, and horror frowns, transport∣ed the next into the romantic scenes of Ar∣cadia, where all is lightsome, and all is gay. Quick as thought the arches of heaven ex∣pand their azure; turrets and spires shoot into the skies; towns, with their spacious edifices, spread themselves to the admiring view. Those lawns, green with freshest her∣bage, those fields, rich with undulating corn, where were they all a moment ago? I brings to my mind that remarkable situa∣tion of the Jewish law-giver, when, elevat∣ed on the summit of Pisgah, he surveyed the goodly land of promise—surveyed "the ri∣vers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter"—surveyed "the mountains droping with wine, and the hills flowing with milk,"
<PB N="97" REF="030558_0094_0FE7CB6DD4EB7BE8"/>
—Surveyed all with those eyes, which for forty tedious years had been con∣fined to dry sands, ragged rocks, and the irksome wastes of a desolate howling wilder∣ness.</P>
<P>On the first <HI>mossy hillock,</HI> which offered its couch, our gentlemen seated themselves. The rising sun had visited the spot to dry up the dews and exhale the damps that might endanger health, to open the violets, and expand the primroses that decked the green. The whole shade of the wood was collected <HI>behind</HI> them, and a beautiful, extensive, most diversified landscape spread itself <HI>before</HI> them.</P>
<P>Theron, according to his usual manner, made many improving remarks on the pros∣pect and its furniture. He traced the foot∣steps of an all comprehending contrivance, and pointed out the strokes of inimitable skill. He observed the grand exertions of power, and the rich exuberance of goodness, most signally, most charmingly conspicuous through the whole.—Upon one circum∣stance he enlarged with particular satisfacti∣on.</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> See, Aspasio! how all is calcu∣lated to administer the highest <HI>delight</HI> to mankind.—Those trees and hedges which
<PB N="98" REF="030558_0095_0FE7CB739207D840"/>skirt the extremities of the landscape, steal∣ing away from their real bulk, and lessening by gentle diminutions, appear like elegant pictures in miniature: those which occupy the nearer situations, are a set of noble imag∣es, swelling upon the eye, in <HI>full proportion,</HI> and in a variety of graceful attitudes; both of them ornamenting the several appart∣ments of our common abode, with a mixture of delicacy and grandeur.</P>
<P>The blossoms that array the branches, the stowers that embroider the mead, ad∣dress and entertain <HI>our</HI> eyes with every charm of beauty; whereas, to <HI>other</HI> crea∣tures, they are destitute of all those attrac∣tives, which result from a combination of the loveliest colours, and most alluring forms. Yonder streams that glide with smooth sere∣nity along the vallies, glittering to the dis∣tant view like sheets of polished silver, or soothing the attentive ear with the softness of aquatic murmurs, are no less <HI>exbilirating</HI> to the fancy, than to the soil through which they pass. The huge enormous mountain, the steep and dizzy precipice, the pendent horrors of the craggy promontory, wild and tremendous as they are, furnish out an agreeable entertainment to the human mind, and <HI>pleass</HI> even while they terrisy, whereas the beasts take no other notice of those ma∣jestic
<PB N="99" REF="030558_0096_0FE7CB751C4DF0F0"/>deformities, than only to avoid the dangers they appear to threaten.</P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> What a magnificent and charming scene!—Hills on either side, gently rising and widely spreading, their summits crowned with scattered villages, and clus∣tering trees. Their slopes divided into a beauteous chequer-work, consisting partly of tillage, with its waving crops, partly of pasturage, with its grazing herds.—Before us the trefoil, the clover, and variety of gras∣sy plants, differently bladed, and differently branched, weave themselves into a <HI>carpet</HI> of living green. Can any of the manufac∣tures formed in the looms, or extended in the palaces of Persia, vie with the covering of this ample area? vie with it in grandeur of size, or delicacy of decoration?</P>
<P>What a profusion of the gayest slowers, fringing the banks, and embroidering the plain!—Nothing can be brighter than the lustre of these silver <HI>daisies</HI>: nothing deeper than the tinge of those golden <HI>crowfoots.</HI> Yet both seem to acquire additional liveli∣ness, by succeeding to the deformity of win∣ter, and by flourishing amidst the freshest verdure.</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> Nature is truly in <HI>her prime.</HI>— The vegetable tribes are putting on their richest attire. Those chesnuts on our right
<PB N="100" REF="030558_0097_0FE7CC9A88D94628"/>hand begin to rear their slowering pyramids; those willows on our left are tipt with tas∣sels of grey, while yonder poplars, which overlook the river, and seem to command the meadows, are pointed with rolls of sil∣ver.</P>
<P>The hawthorn, in every <HI>Hedge,</HI> is partly turged with silken gems, partly diffused into a milk white bloom. Not a straggling furze, nor a solitary thicket on the <HI>Heath,</HI> but wears a rural nosegay. Even amidst that neglected <HI>Dike,</HI> the arum rises in hum∣ble state; most curiously shouded in her leafy tabernacle, and surrounded with lux∣uriant families, each distinguished by a pe∣culiar livery of green. Look wherever we will, all is a delightful display of present fertility, and joyous pledge of future plenty. —Now we experience what the royal poet, in very delicate imagery, describes: "The winter is past; the rain is over and gone. The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of bir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s is come; and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land. The fig-tree putteth forth her green figs; and the vine with her tender grapes give a good smell."</P>
<P><HI>Asiasio.</HI> See! Theron, what the cheer∣ing warmth, and the genial showers of spring have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one! The rough tree sostens into
<PB N="101" REF="030558_0098_0FE7A767B4B68D78"/>verdure. The ragged thorn is robed with beauty. Even the uncultivated lanes teem with herbage. <HI>Such</HI> a change, so pleasing and so ennobling, the gospel of CHRIST in∣troduces into the soul.—Not a day, scarce an hour passes, but this season of universal fecundity produces something <HI>new</HI>; some∣thing that improves the aspect, and increases the riches of nature. And is there any state, or any circumstance of life, in which the faith of CHRIST does not exert a similar effi∣cacy? Does not purify the heart, and bring forth fruit unto GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> To me who have spent the great∣est part of the winter in <HI>town,</HI> these scenes of the <HI>country</HI> are inexpressibly pleasing. Take who will, the gilded saloon, and the silken settee; so long as I can shelter myself under the canopy of such a spreading beech, and use one of its coarse mis-shapen roots for my seat.</P>
<P>'Tis true we see no longer those splen∣did brocades and elegant toupee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which dis∣tinguish the <HI>Park</HI> and <HI>Mall.</HI>—But we have full in our view a multitude of honest rus∣tics, pursuing their cheerful labours in yon∣der <HI>meadow</HI>; some mowing the luxuriant herbage; some spreadin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it to the sun, or raising it into regular cocks; others loading their waggons with the hay, or clearing the
<PB N="102" REF="030558_0099_0FE7CC25025171E0"/>ground with their rakes; the ground, clear∣ed of its sost incumberance, appears fresh and green, like another spring, while the exhalations of the tedded grass, floating in the air, gives a rural perfume to the gale.— And which, my Aspasio, which are the most valuable objects? the <HI>little labourers</HI> of the hive that enrich themselves and regale their masters, or the <HI>gay flutterers</HI> of the garden, whose life is nothing but sport, and their highest character is to be insignificantly pretty?</P>
<P><HI>Aspasio.</HI> In this, retirement we hear none of the wanton and corrupting airs of the opera; no, nor the majestic and ennobling melody of the cratorio.—But we have a band of music stationed in the grove, and a concert of native harmony warbling from the boughs. We are entertained with the music, which charmed the human ear, long before Jubal found out his instruments, and thousands of years before Handel composed his notes. —The bullfinch, and a multitude of lit∣tle tuneful throats, strike the key. The thrush below and the sky-lark responsive from above, <HI>diversify</HI> and exalt the strain. The blackbird, somewhat like the solemn organ, with notes perfectly melodious, and gracefully sonorous, crowns the choir, while t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtle's m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ancholy voice, and the mur∣muring
<PB N="103" REF="030558_0100_0FE7CB7ADA6074E8"/>water's plaintive tone, <HI>deepen</HI> and complete the universal symphony.</P>
<P><HI>Theron.</HI> The inhabitants of yonder vil∣lages have never beheld the splendid proces∣sion, which solemnizes the coronation of a monarch, nor the <HI>gaudy illuminations</HI> which distinguish the anniversary of his birth: but they see, almost every morning, a much no∣bler spectacle displayed in the east. They see the great <HI>Ruler</HI> of the <HI>day,</HI> or rather the en∣voy from day's eternal SOVEREIGN, making his entry amidst the spaces of the sky. The heavens are strewed with colours which out∣vie the pinks and carnations. The grass is decked with dew drops, and every plant is strung, as it were, with pearls. All a∣round the darkness retires, and sweet re∣sreshing gales arise. At length the magni∣ficent luminary appears. And what is all the ostentatious pomp of kings? what is all the glitter of the most brilliant courts, com∣pared with his transcendent lustre?—This spectacle we may behold, without loss of time, or prejudice to health. Nay, we cannot behold it, without <HI>improving</HI> one and <HI>redeeming</HI> the other. So beneficial are even the pleasures which nature yields! so ser∣viceable the diversions to which she invites!</P>
<P>Talking in this manner, they arrive at the <HI>Park.</HI> Which, the moment you enter, fills
<PB N="104" REF="030558_0101_0FE7CB7C6725E960"/>the view with its bold, enlarged, and magni∣ficent sweep.—It was diversified with level and rising ground. Here, scooped into mimic Amphitheatres; with the <HI>Deer</HI> pen∣dent on the little summit, or shooting down the precipice. There, raised into gentle hillocks; some of which were canopied with a large, solitary oak; others were tuft∣ed with a cluster of tapering and verdent elms. Two or three <HI>Cascades,</HI> gleaming from afar, as they poured along the slanting rock, or the grassy slope, gave a pleasing variation to the prospect. While they star∣tled the timorous unexperienced. Fawns, with their foaming current, and watery roar. <HI>Grandeur</HI> and <HI>Simplicity</HI> seemed to be the ge∣nius of the place. Every thing breathed an air of noble negligence and artless majesty.</P>
<P>In the centre of all, rose a curious <HI>roman∣tic mount.</HI>—Its form was exactly round, somewhat like a sugar-loaf whose cone is lopt off a little below the top—Not coeval with nature, but the work of human in∣dustry. Thrown up, 'tis supposed, in those perilous times, when Britain was alarmed by foreign invasions, or bled with intestine wounds.—It was covered all around with elder shrubs, whose ranks, gradually rising and spreading shade above shade, compos∣ed a kind of woody theatre, through which were struck two or three <HI>spiral walks,</HI> lead∣ing,
<PB N="105" REF="030558_0102_0FE7CB81959ABB30"/>by a gentle ascent, and under embow∣ering verdure, to the summit.—At proper intervals, and on every side of the hill, were formed little <HI>arbours,</HI> with appertures cut through the boughs, to admit a prospect of the country.—In one or other of these leafy boxes, you command, at every hour of the day, either the enlivening sun, or the re∣freshing shade.—All along the circling a∣venues, and all arounds the rests sprung daffodils, primroses and violets; which, mingling with hyacinths and cowslips, com∣posed many a charming piece of <HI>natural Mosaic.</HI></P>
<P>How agreeable as they climb and wind themselves round the hill, to reflect on the <HI>happy change,</HI> which has now taken place! Where steely helmets gleamed, or brazen shields clashed, the <HI>Goldfinches</HI> twitter their loves, and display their painted plumes. The dens of rapine, or the horrid haunts of bloodshed, are become the retreats of calm contemplation, and friendly converse.—In yonder lower spaces, where the armed troops were wont to patrole; from whence they made excursions to ravage the villages, or terrify the swains; the <HI>Fallow-Deers</HI> trip lightly, or the full-headed Stags stand at bay.</P>
<P>From a small eminence, but at a consider∣able
<PB N="106" REF="030558_0103_0FE7CB83E1338300"/>distance, gushed a couple of springs, which, rambling through a grove, lost one another in the shady labyrinth. Emerging at length from the gloom, they approached nearer and neater, and sell into embraces at the foot of this hill. They rolled in amica∣ble conjunction along the pebbly channel, which incircles its basis, and added their <HI>so∣ber melody</HI> to the <HI>sprightly warbling</HI> of the birds. Flowing off in one common stream, they formed the fine pieces of water which beautified the Park. From thence, they stole into the meadow, and widened into a <HI>River</HI>: there, enamoured as it were with each other, they glide by wealthy towns, and sweep through flowery vales, regardless of the blooming toys which deck the one, and of the noisy crowds which throng the other.</P>
<P>So said <HI>Aspasio,</HI> may Theron and his Seli∣ma pleasing and pleased with each other, pass through the busy and the amusing scenes of life: neither captivated by the one, nor anxious for the other. With such harmoni∣ous agreement, and indissoluble union, may they pursue the course marked out by pro∣vidence, their happiness <HI>increasing,</HI> and their usefulness enlarging, as they draw nearer the ocean of all good: then, parted by a gen∣tle stroke of death, like the waters of some ample stream severed by the piers of an in∣tervening bridge, may they speedily re-u∣nite!
<PB N="107" REF="030558_0104_0FE7CB89922FC6E8"/>Re-unite in consumate bliss, and ne∣ver, never be separated more.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF AN ARBOUR AND CURI∣OUS FOUNTAIN IN THERON'S GARDEN.</HEAD>
<P>STRONG and substantial plants of <HI>libur∣num</HI> formed the shell, while the slender and flexile shoots of <HI>syringa</HI> filled up the in∣terstices. —Was it to compliment, as well as to accommodate their worthy guests, that the shrubs interwove the luxuriant fo∣liage? was it to represent those tender but close attachments, which had <HI>united</HI> their af∣fections, and <HI>blended</HI> their interests?—I will not too positively ascribe such a design to the disposition of the branches. They composed, however, by their twining em∣braces, no inexpressive emblem of the <HI>en∣dearments</HI> and the <HI>advantages</HI> of friendship. They composed a canopy of the freshest verdure, and of the thickest texture; so thick, that it entirely excluded the sultry ray, and shed both a cool refreshment, and an amusive gloom, while every unsheltered tract glared with light, or sainted with heat.</P>
<P>You enter by an easy ascent of steps, lin∣ed
<PB N="108" REF="030558_0105_0FE7CB8B27836AE0"/>with turf, and fenced with a balustrade of sloping bay-trees.—The roof was a fine <HI>concave,</HI> peculiarly elevated and stately. Not embossed with sculpture, not mantled over with fret-work, but far more delicate∣ly adorned with the syringa's <HI>silver tusts,</HI> and the <HI>liburnum's flowering gold</HI>; whose large and lovely clusters, gracefully pendent from the leafy dome, disclosing their sweets to the delighted bee, and gently waving to the balmy breath of spring, gave the utmost en∣richment to the charming bower.</P>
<P>Facing the entrance lay a spacious grassy walk, terminated by an octangular bason, with a curious <HI>Jet d' Eau</HI> playing in the cen∣tre. The waters, spinning from the low∣er orifices, were attenuated into innumera∣ble little threads, which dispersed themselves in an horizontal direction, and returned to the reservoir in a drizling shower. Those, which issued from the higher tubes, and larger appertures, either springed perpendi∣cularly, or spouted obliquely, and formed, as they fell, several lofty arches of liquid chrystal, all <HI>glittering</HI> to the eye, and <HI>cooling</HI> to the air.</P>
<P>Parallel to the walk, ran a <HI>parterre,</HI> plan∣ted with an assemblage of flowers, which ad∣vanced, one above another, in regular gra∣dations of height, of dignity, and of beauty.
<PB N="109" REF="030558_0106_0FE7CB90EA889878"/>First a row of <HI>daisies,</HI> gay as the sinile of youth, and fair as the virgin snows.—Next a range of <HI>crocuses,</HI> like a long stripe of yel∣low sattin, quilted with threads, or diversified with sprigs of green. A superior order of <HI>ra∣nunculuses,</HI> each resmebling the cap of an earl's coronet, replenished the third story, with full-blown tufts of glossy scarlet.—Beyond this, a more elevated line of <HI>tulips</HI> raised their flourished heads, and opened their enameled cups; not bedecked with a single tint only, but glowing with an intermingled variety of radiant hues. Above all arose that noble or∣nament of a royal escutcheon, the <HI>flower∣de-luce,</HI> bright with etherial blue, and grand with imperial purple; which formed, by its graceful projections, a cornice or a capi∣tal of more than Corinthian richness, and imparted the most consummate beauty to the blooming colonade.</P>
<P>The whole, viewed from the arbour, look∣ed like a <HI>rainbow</HI> painted upon the ground, and wanted nothing to rival that resplendent arch, only the boldness of its sweep, and the advantage of its ornamental curve.</P>

<HEAD>ANOTHER VIEW OF THERON'S PLEASURE GROUNDS AND HERMETICAL RETREAT, WITH A DESCRIPTION OF NOON.</HEAD>
<P>THERON and Aspasio enter a spacious <HI>lawn,</HI> which lay opposite to the house, and opened itself in the form of an expand∣ed fan. The mounds, on either side, were dressed in verdure, and ran out in a stanting direction. The whole, to an eye placed at a distance, bore the resemblance of a magni∣ficent <HI>vista,</HI> contracting, by slow degrees, its dimensions, and lessening, at last, into a point, which the regular and graceful seat, with all imaginable dignity, supplied.</P>
<P>Nature had sunk the lawn into a gentle <HI>decline,</HI> on whose ample sides were oxen brov, zing, and lambs frisking. The lusty droves lowed as they passed, and the thriving flocks bleated welcome music in their mas∣ter's ear. Along the midst of this verdant slope was stretched a spacious and extensive <HI>walk</HI>; which, coated with gravel, and fenc∣ed with pallisadoes, looked like a plain stripe of brown, intersecting a carpet of the brightest green. At the bottom, two hand∣some <HI>canals,</HI> copiously stocked with fish, sometimes stood unmoved, "pure as the expanse of Heaven." The waters, beheld from every room in the house, had a fine ef∣fect upon the sight, not without a refreshing
<PB N="111" REF="030558_0108_0FE7CB98333880C8"/>influence on the imagination.—At the ex∣tremity of one, was planted a stately <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nade</HI>: the roof elevated on pillars of the <HI>Ionic</HI> order; the area slabbed with stones, neatly ranged in the diamond fashion. Se∣veral forest-chairs accommodated the an∣glers with a seat, while the bending dome supplied them with a shade.</P>
<P>Corresponding, and on the margin of the other canal, was erected a <HI>summer-bouse,</HI> of a vey singular kind.—The lower part had an opening towards the north; it was cool, it was gloomy, and had never seen the sun. It carried the romantic air of a <HI>grotto,</HI> or rather the pensive appearance of a <HI>hermit's cell.</HI> The outside was coarse and rugged, with pertuberant stones; partly overspread with ivy, partly with moss, it seemed to be the work of ancient years. You descend by steps of turf, and are obliged to stoop as you pass the door. A scanty iron grate, with certain narrow slits in the wall, transmit a glimmering light, just sufficient to disco∣ver the inner structure, which appears like one continued piece of rock-work, a ca∣vern cut from the surrounding quarry.—<HI>A∣bove</HI> hung an irregular arch with an aspect that seemed to presage the fall, and more than seemed to alarm the stranger. <HI>Below</HI> lay a paving of homely pebbles, in some places a little furrowed, as though it had
<PB N="112" REF="030558_0109_0FE7CB99C3DE4BA0"/>been worn by the frequent tread of solitary feet. <HI>All ar ound</HI> were rusticity and solemni∣ty; solemnity never more visibly seen than through a gloom.—The furniture all of the same <HI>grotiesque</HI> fashion with the apartment. A bench hewed, you would suspect, by na∣ture's chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sel, out of the solid stone. A sort of couch, composed of swelling moss, and small fibrous roots.—From one corner tric∣kled a pure spring, which crept, with a bub∣bling moan, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ong the channeled floor, till its current was collected into a bason, rude∣ly scoped from the ground. On the edge of this little receptacle, lay chained a rusty bowl; and over it stood an antique worm-eaten table.—On the least obscure part of the wall you discern, <HI>dimly</HI> discern, a parch∣ment scroll, inscribed with that sage but mor∣tifying admonition, "<HI>Vanity of vanities! all is vanity!</HI>"</P>
<P>Over this recess, so pleasingly horrid, and adapted to solem musings, arose an open and airy <HI>Belviders.</HI> You ascend by winding stairs, and coming from the <HI>uncouth</HI> abode below, are sweetly surprised with an <HI>elegant</HI> hexagon.—The ceiling lofty, and decorated with the softest, richest, almost flowing fret∣work. The wainscot, in large pannels of oak, retained its native auburn; so beau∣tifully plain, that, like an amiable counte∣nance, it would have been disfigured, rather
<PB N="113" REF="030558_0110_0FE7CB9F9077E588"/>than improved, by the most costly paint. On this were disposed, in gilded frames, and to great advantage, a variety of entertain∣ing <HI>landscapes</HI>; but none surpassed, none e∣qualled, all were a foil to the noble lovely views which the windows commanded. The chimney-piece, of white shining mar∣ble, streaked with veins of vivid red. Over it was carved a fine festoon of artisicial, in it was ranged a choice collection of natural flowers.—On a table of glossy walnut, lay a portable telescope, attended with <HI>Thomson's Seasons</HI> and <HI>Vanierii Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dium Rusticum.</HI></P>
<P>The whole was fitted up in the highest taste, and furnished with every pleasurable ornament; on purpose to harmonize with that <HI>lavish gaity,</HI> which seemed to smile o∣ver all the face of nature; on purpose to correspond with that vernal <HI>delight</HI> which came breathing on the wings of every fra∣grant gale; I may add, on purpose to re∣mind the beholder of those <HI>immortal mansions,</HI> which are decorated with images, infinite∣ly more splendid, with objects unspeakably more glorious; where holy beings will spend, not a few vacant hours in refined a∣musement, but a boundless eternity in the consummation of joy.—For, to a well-turn∣ed mind, nature is a preceptor, and these are he instructive lessons. To the pure in heart, even sense is edifying, and these are its most delicate moralities.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="030558_0111_0FE7CBA11F38FF08"/>
The redundant waters of the canal rolled off in a spreading <HI>cascade</HI>; which, tumbling from many a little precipice, soothed the air with a symphony of soft and gurgling sounds; for ever intermitted the obliging office.</P>
<Q>"From morn to room, from noon to dewy eve".</Q>
<P>But when the fanning breezes dropt their wings, when the feathered choir were hush∣ed in sleep, when not so much as a chirping grasshopper was heard throughout the meads, this liquid instrument played its <HI>solo</HI>; still pursued its busy way, and warbled, as it flowed melodious murmurs.</P>
<P>The sun was fiercely bright, and the sky without a cloud. Not a breath fanned the woods, not a gale curled the stream.—The fields exposed to all the fiery beams, were like a glowing hearth.—The little brids, overcome by the potent influence, lost for a while their tuneful notes. No∣thing was heard in the garden but the drow∣sy hum of bees, and the moan-like buz of winged insects.—All nature seemed to <HI>lan∣guish.</HI> The flourishing meads looked sick∣ly, the gayest blossoms began to fade, the sprightliest animals, if not reposed under some cooling shelter panted for breath, and hung their drooping heads amidst the all∣surrounding blaze and the unsusferable heat.</P>

<HEAD>THERON'S RURAL ELOPEMENT DESCRIBED.</HEAD>
<P>THERON, as soon as the tea-equipage was removed, took his way, to the <HI>wood.</HI> Longing for the thickest shade, he hastened to the center. The avenue, con∣sisting of a serpentine walk, which, after having presented you with several species of plants, and several degrees of verdure, ends in a large circular area; not covered with a Grecian or Roman temple, unmean∣ing imitation of Pagan idolatry, but surroun∣ded with aged and princely oaks, the coali∣tion of whose branches, threw over the grassy plot a majestic rural dome, and their unpierced foliage "imbrowned the noon∣tide hours."</P>
<P>In the midst, and elevated on a square base, was a statue representing the venerable Elijah, in a posture of worship, with his hands stretched out, and eyes listed up to Heaven. His attitude, his air, his every seature, were a most lively comment on those strong, energetic expressions of scripture; "take hold on GOD; wrestle with the AL∣MIGHTY; pour out your hearts before HIM."—On one side of the pedestal were engraven the priests of Baal, in frantic
<PB N="116" REF="030558_0113_0FE7CBA87132D170"/>emotions calling upon their senseless deity, and gashing themselves with unavailing wounds.—On the other was exhibited, in basso-relievo, the adorable Tishbite's altar; his victim burning with fire from the Lord, even while the water ran from every limb, and overflowed the trench below.</P>
<P>A remote cascade tumbled from a crag∣gy rock. The very stream, like its master seemed in haste to escape from the intense and raging heat. With hurry and impe∣tuosity it rushed into this grand arbour. But here, impressed as it were, with the unex∣pected <HI>solemnity</HI> of the scene, it suddenly checked the tumultuous wave: and having just saluted or kissed the skirts of this revered spot, turned aside into a more sequestred path. As some <HI>heedless</HI> trifler who bolts unawares into the royal presence, stands struck with reverence and awe, or retires with precipitance and confusion.</P>
<P>The deep gloom, shedding a kind of night, even while the sun glared in the sky. —Not a whisper stirring, among so many millions of leaves, and all their warbling na∣tives hushed in silence. The sonorous <HI>toll</HI> of the distant <HI>cascade,</HI> and the tink∣ling <HI>chime</HI> of the nearer rill. The profound adoration and fervent devotion, which lived in the lineaments of the impassioned stone.
<PB N="117" REF="030558_0114_0FE7CBAD9EA28F50"/>—All these circumstances rendered the place peculiarly pensive and august. Not much unlike the ancient oratories, where holy peo∣ple withdrew from the giddy ring, and the bustling croud, to ennoble their minds with sublime contemplation; where they bid a temporary adieu to the tumultuous world, its gay impertinence, in order to maintain a more uninterrupted communion with that mighty Being, "who sitteth upon the cir∣cle of the earth, and the inhabitants there∣of are as grasshoppers before him."</P>

<HEAD>THERON AND ASPASIO'S CONVERSATION ON THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>THE morning had been wet. At noon the rain ceased, but the heavens still continued gloomy.—Towards evening a gentle eastern gale sprung up, which dissipat∣ed the dead calm, and cleared the face of the sky.—The sun, which had been muffled in clouds, dropped the veil. Disengaged from the dusky shroud, he shone forth with <HI>superior splendor.</HI> His beams, endeared by their late suspension, were doubly welcome, and produced unusual gaiety.</P>
<P>At this juncture, Theron and Aspasio
<PB N="118" REF="030558_0115_0FE7CBAFC6A2B718"/>walked abroad. They walked alternately on the terraces, one of which was opposite to the country, the other contiguous to the parterre, where the gales, impregnated with the freshest exhalations of nature, breathed the smells of meads, and fields, and groves; or else, shaking the clusters of ros∣es, and sweeping the beds of fragrance, they flung balm and odours through the air.</P>
<P>At a distance were heard the bleatings of the flock, mingled with the lowings of the milky mothers, while more melodious music warbled from the neighbouring boughs, &amp; spoke aloud the joy of their feathered inha∣bitants; and not only spoke their joy, but spread an <HI>additional</HI> charm over all the land∣scape. For, amidst such strains of native harmony, the breathing perfumes smell more sweet, the streaming rills shine more clear, and the universal prospect looks more gay.</P>
<P>Then was experienced what Milton so delicately describes;</P>
<Q><L>"As when, from mountain-tops the dusky clouds</L>
<L>"Ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'erspread</L>
<L>"Heav'n's chearful face, the low'ring element</L>
<L>"Scowl's o'er the darken'd land scape snow or show'r;</L>
<L>"If chance the radiant sun, with farewel sweet,</L>
<L>"Extend his evening beam, the fields revive,</L>
<L>"The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds</L>
<L>"<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>est their joy, that hill and valley rings."</L></Q>
<P><PB N="119" REF="030558_0116_0FE7CBB583EFD000"/>
With wonder and delight our friends ob∣served both the exquisite beauty and the immense magnificence of things. They were struck with the most profound veneration of that Almighty majesty, who hung the sun in vaults of azure, and clothed his orb with robes of lustre. Whose "right hand span∣neth the Heavens, and stretched them out as a tent," for innumerable creatures, worlds, and systems <HI>to dwell in.</HI>—Charmed they were at the consideration of the Creator's boundless beneficence; who lifts up the light of his countenance, and joy is shed; who opens his munificent hand, and plenty is poured throughout all the regions of the universe; insomuch, that even inani∣mate beings seem to smile under a sense of the blessings; and, though they find not a tongue to praise, yet speak their acclamati∣ons by their <HI>gladdened</HI> looks.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description">
<HEAD>THERON'S MORAL SOLILOQUY ON THE BE∣NEFITS OF RURAL SOLITUDE.</HEAD>
<P>THE sky was peculiarly beautiful, and perfectly clear; only where the fine indigo received an agreeable heightening by a few thin and scattered clouds, which im∣bibed
<PB N="120" REF="030558_0117_0FE7CBB70EB0C9B8"/>the solar rays, and looked like pensile fleeces of purest <HI>wool.</HI>—All things appeared with so mild, so majestic, so charming an aspect, that, intent as Theron was upon a different subject, he could not but indulge the following soliloquy.</P>
<P>"How delightful are the scenes of rural nature! especially to the <HI>philosophic</HI> eye and <HI>contemplative</HI> mind.—I cannot wonder that persons in high life are so fond of retiring from a conspicuous and exalted station, to the covert of a shady grove, or the margin of a chrystal stream: are so desirous of quit∣ting the smoaky town, and noisy street, in order to breath purer air, and survey the wonders of creation in the silent, the serene, the peaceful villa.</P>
<P>"'Tis true in the country, there are none of the modish, I had almo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> said, meritrici∣ous ornaments of that <HI>false</HI> politeness, which refines people out of their veracity, but an easy simplicity of manners, with an unaffect∣ed sincerity of mind.—Here the solemn farce of ceremony is seldom brought into play, and the pleasing delusions of compliment have no place; but the brow is the <HI>real</HI> in∣dex of the temper, and speech the <HI>genuine</HI> in∣terpreter of the heart.</P>
<P>"In the country, I acknowledge, we are
<PB N="121" REF="030558_0118_0FE7CBBCD71D2510"/>seldom invited to see the <HI>mimic</HI> attempts of human art; but we, every where, behold the grand and masterly exertions of divine power.—No <HI>theatre</HI> erects its narrow stage, sour rounds it with puny rows of ascending seats, or adorns it with a shifting series of gorgeous scenery. But <HI>fields</HI> extend their ample area, at first lightly clad with a scarf of springing green, then deeply planted with an arrangement of spindling stalks; as a few more weeks advance, covered with a profusion of bearded or husky grain, at last richly laden with a harvest of yellow plenty.</P>
<P>"<HI>Meadows</HI> disclose their beautiful bosom, yield a soft and fertile lap for the luxriant herbage, and suckle myriads of the fairest, gayest flowers; which, without any vain o∣stenation, or jealous anxiety, rival each other in all the elegance of dress,—<HI>Groves</HI> of vari∣ous leaf, arrayed in freshest verdure, and li∣beral of their reviving shade, rise in amia∣ble, in noble prospect, all around.—<HI>Droves</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urdy oxen, strong for labour, or fat for the shambles; <HI>herds</HI> of sleeky kine, with milk in their udders, and violets in their no∣strils; <HI>flocks</HI> of well fleeced sheep, with their snowy lambkins frisking at their side; these compose the living machinery. Boundless tracts of bending <HI>azure,</HI> varnished with ini∣mitable delicacy, and hung with starry lamps, or irradiated with solar lustre form the state∣ly
<PB N="122" REF="030558_0119_0FE7CBBE6362A3B8"/>ceiling.—While the early breezes and the evening gales, charged with no unwhole∣some vapours, breeding no pestilential taint, but fanning the humid buds, and waving their odoriferous wings, dispense a profusion of <HI>sweets,</HI> mingled with the most sovereign sup∣ports of health.—This is the school of industry! this the magazine of plenty! and are they not incomparably <HI>more delightful,</HI> as well as infinitely <HI>less dangerous</HI> then those se∣minaries of lewdness and impiety, where sin and ruin wear the mask of pleasure? than those temples of prosusness and debauche∣ry, where Belial is daily or nightly worship∣ped with what his votaries call, modish re∣creation, and genteel amusement?</P>
<P>"Here, indeed, is no tuneful <HI>veice</HI> to melt in strains of amorous anguish, and transfuse the sickening fondness to the hearer's breast. No skilful artist to inform the <HI>lute</HI> with mu∣sical enchantment; to strike infectious me∣lody from the viol, and sooth away the re∣solution and activity of virtue, in wanton de∣sires, or voluptuous indolence.—But the <HI>plains</HI> low, the <HI>hills</HI> bleat, and the hollow cir∣cling <HI>rocks</HI> echo with the universal song. E∣very valley remurmurs to the fall of silver fountains, or the liquid lapse of gurgling rills.—Birds, when the cheerful morning ris∣es, or the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntle evening descends, perched on a thousand boughs, play a thousand airs,
<PB N="123" REF="030558_0120_0FE7CBC398331180"/>wildly, yet sweetly, harmonious. And did ever music exceed their untaught sprightly warblings? or can any colours outvie their gay and glossy plumage?</P>
<P>"Charmed, therefore, with the sinest views, lulled with the softest sounds, and treated with the richest odours, what can be wanting to complete the delight? here is <HI>every</HI> entertainment for the eye, the most re∣fined gratification for the ear, and a <HI>perpetu∣al</HI> banquet for the smell, without any insidi∣ous decoy, for the integrity of our conduct, or even for the purity of our fancy.</P>
<P>"O ye blooming walks and flowry lawns surrounded with dewy landscapes? how of∣ten have <HI>patriots</HI> and <HI>heroes</HI> laid aside the burden of power, and stole away from the glare of grandeur, to enjoy themselves in your composed retreats!—ye mossy couch∣es and fragrant bowers, skirted with cool∣ing cascades! how many <HI>illustrious</HI> personag∣es, after all their glorious toil for the pub∣lic good, have sought an honorable and wel∣come repose in your downy lap? ye vene∣rable oaks and solemn groves! woods that whisper to the quivering gale! clifts that overhang the darkened flood! who can number the <HI>sages</HI> and <HI>saints</HI> that have devot∣ed the day to study, or resigned a vacant hour to healthy exercise beneath your syl∣van

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF CAMILLUS'S GARDENS, AND THE BEAUTIFUL PROSPECT FROM HIS SUMMER-HOUSE.</HEAD>
<P>THERON and Aspasio walked several times along a close shady alley, arched with the foliage of <HI>filberts.</HI> Here, hid from every eye, and the whole world withdrawn from our view, we seemed like <HI>monks</HI> stroll∣ing in their cloisters.—Turning short at the and, we enter a parallel range of majestic and uniformly spreading <HI>walnut-trees.</HI> This transition was somewhat like advancing through a low porch into the aisles of a mag∣nificent cathedral. The broad leaf and large trunk of those lordly trees, their very diffu∣sive spread, added to their prodigious height, give them an air of uncommon dignity. It
<PB N="125" REF="030558_0122_0FE7CBCB843DD0C0"/>swells the imagination with vast ideas, and entertains us with a romantic kind of de∣light, to expatiate amidst such huge columns, and under such superb elevations of living architecture.</P>
<P>Quitting our cathedral, we turn once a∣again, and pass into a grand colonade of <HI>oaks</HI>; so regular in their situation, so simi∣lar in their size, and so remarkably corres∣pondent in every circumstance, that they looked like the <HI>twins</HI> of nature, not only be∣longing to the same family, but produced at the same birth.—Through these lay a walk, straight, spacious, and gracefully long; far exceeding the last in the extent of its area, though much inferior in the stateliness of its ceiling. It put me in mind of that divine be∣nignity, which has allowed us the space of <HI>six</HI> days for the prosecution of our own com∣paratively low affairs, and set apart but <HI>one</HI> in seven for the more immediate attendance on the sublime duty of worshipping our Cre∣ator.</P>
<P>This walk was covered with the neatest <HI>gravel,</HI> and not a weed to be seen, nor one blade of grass, through the whole extended surface. It stole into a continual ascent; yet so very gradually, that the rise was scarce discernable, either by the searching eye, the toiling feet, or the panting breath.—At
<PB N="126" REF="030558_0123_0FE7CBCD19CE1FF8"/>the extremity, a handsome <HI>summer-house</HI> shewed a flight of steps, and half a <HI>Venetian</HI> door. The rest of the building was hid by the low hung clustering branches.</P>
<P>As soon as we enter the apartment, Ca∣millus throws open the left hand sash, and with it a most enlarged and amusive <HI>prospect.</HI> —The structure appeared situate on the brow of a considerable eminence, whose sides were partly confused and wild with broken rocks, partly shagged and perplex∣ed with thorny shrubs. The spectator is a∣greeably surprised to find himself accommo∣dated with so <HI>elegant</HI> a mansion, on the sum∣mit of so <HI>rude</HI> and <HI>ruinous</HI> a spot.—But how greatly is his surprise and his satisfaction augmented, when he casts his eye forward, and beholds the beautiful <HI>meads,</HI> which, from the foot of this ragged hill, stretch them∣selves into a space almost unmeasurable<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>Through the midst of this extensive vale, which was decked with the finest verdure, and replenished with the richest herbage, a <HI>river</HI> rolled its copious flood; rolled, in a thousand serpentine <HI>meanders,</HI> as though it was loth to leave the flowry scene, and made repeated efforts to prolong its stay a∣midst such lovely objects.—Till, at last, having loitered in its own labyrinths, and wandered more than twice the length of the
<PB N="127" REF="030558_0124_0FE7CBD24BEA00C8"/>meadows, having held a mirror to the aspi∣ring poplars and bending willows, having paid a welcome salute to several ornamental <HI>villas,</HI> and passed through the arches of two or three curiously pendent bridges; it seem∣ed to meet the sky, and mingle with the horizon.</P>
<P>Opposite to the front window, a <HI>cascade</HI> fell from the adjacent stream. It flashed and foamed along the broad slope, indented with small pits, and jagged with protuber∣ant stones. The current, vexed and embar∣rassed, seemed to <HI>rave</HI> at the intervening ob∣stacles, and forcing its rapid, indignant, so∣norous way, struck the ear with a peal of li∣quid thunder. These fretful waters, let our <HI>angry</HI> passions observe the admonition, and follow the example, soon forgot their rage, soon recovered their temper: collected in∣to a little rivulet, they ran off in calm and si∣lent lapse, till they lost themselves amongst beds of osier, and plantations of alder.</P>
<P>The river, widening as it flowed, was parted here and there by several little islands. Scattered as it were, by the hand of chance, and raising their green heads in the midst of the lucid stream, they presented a most un∣expected, and most pleasing spectacle. Some were tusted with reeds, and surrounded with rocks and shoals, the unmolested resort of
<PB N="128" REF="030558_0125_0FE7CBD4650C6BB8"/>swans. Some adorned with stately <HI>porticos</HI> and splendid <HI>alcoves,</HI> the graceful retreats of rural pleasure. One, larger than the rest, seemed to be furnished with cool em∣bowering walks, fitted for studious retire∣ment, or sedate contemplation.—On either side of the charming valley, towns and vil∣lages lay thick, and looked gay, adding or∣nament and variety to the scene, and receiv∣ing innumerable advantages from the passing wave.</P>

<HEAD>THERON'S EVENING MEDITATIONS ON AS∣PASIO'S DISCOURSE.</HEAD>
<P>THE last evening was one of the finest I ever saw. According to custom I made an excursion into the open fields, and wanted nothing to complete the satisfaction, but my friend's company. I could not but observe how much your improving conver∣sation heightened the charms of nature. When religion applied <HI>philosophy,</HI> every thing was <HI>instructive,</HI> as well as <HI>pleasing.</HI>—Not a breeze swept over the plains to clear the sky, and cool the air; but it tended also to
<PB N="130" REF="030558_0127_0FE7CBDBC1071790"/>disperse our doubts, and enliven our faith in the Supreme All-sufficient <HI>Good.</HI>—Not a cloud tinged the firmament with radiant co∣lours, or amused the sight with romantic shapes, but we beheld a picture of the pre∣sent world. Its <HI>fading</HI> acquisitions and <HI>fan∣tastic</HI> joys were pourtrayed in the mimic forms and transitory scene.—Even the weakest of the insect tribe, that skim the air in sportive silence, addressed us with the strongest incitements, and gave us the loud∣est calls to be <HI>active</HI> in our day, and <HI>useful</HI> in our generation. They cried, at least when you lent them your tongue,</P>
<Q><L>"Such is vain life, an idle flight of days,</L>
<L>"A still delusive round of sickly joys,</L>
<L>"A scene of little cares, and trifling passions,</L>
<L>"If not ennobled by the deeds of virtue."</L></Q>
<P>How often, at the approach of sober eve, have we sauntered through the dusky glade, observing the last remains of light, now im∣purpling the western clouds, now faintly gleaming on the mountain's brow, now creeping insensibly from all the shady land∣scape. —How often have we stole along the cloysters of some leafy bower, attentive to the tale of a <HI>querulcus</HI> current, that seemed to be struck with horror at the awful gloom, and complained with heavier murmurs as it passed under the blackening shades, and a∣long the root-obstructed channel.—Or else,
<PB N="131" REF="030558_0128_0FE7CBE18580D040"/>far from the bubbling brook, and softly treading the grassy path, we listened to the <HI>nightingale's</HI> song; while every gale held its breath, and all the leaves forbore their n:o∣tion, that they might neither drown nor in∣terrupt the melodious woe.—From both which pensive strains, you endeavoured to temper and chas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se the exuberant gaiety of my spirits. You covinced me that <HI>true</HI> joy is a serious thing; is the child of sedate thought, not the spawn of intemperate mirth; nursed, not by the sallies of disso∣lute merriment, but by the exercise of se∣rene contemplation.</P>
<P>Sometimes at the gladsome return of morn, we have ascended an airy eminence, and hailed the new-born day, gazed the dew-bright earth, and followed, with our delighted eve, the mazes of some glittering stream.—Here, <HI>rushing</HI> with impetuous fury over the mountain's summits, tumbling from rock to rock, and roaring down the crag∣gy sleep. Impatient, as it were, to get free from such rugged paths, and mingle itself with the adjacent mead.—There, slackening its headlong carcor, and soothing its eddies into a glassy surface, and a gentle flow. While deep embosomed in they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dant soil, it <HI>winds</HI> through the cherished and smiling herbage; sometimes lost amidst the closing willows, sometimes issuing with fresh lustre from the

A row of regular pillars extended themselves through the midst; supporting the roof with fimplicity, and with dignity. The light that passed through
<PB N="133" REF="030558_0130_0FE7CBE8D980D6D0"/>the windows, seemed to shed a kind of lu∣minous obscurity, which gave every object a grave and venerable air.—The deep si∣lence, added to the gloomy aspect, and both heightened by the loneliness of the place, greatly increased the solemnity of the scene. —A sort of religious dread stole insensibly on my mind, while I advanced, all pensive and thoughtful, along the inmost aisle: such a dread, as hushed every ruder passion, and dissipated all the gay images of an alluring world.</P>

<P>A servant or two, from a revering dis∣tance, cast many a wishful look, and con∣dole their honored master, in the language offighs. The condescending mildness of his commands, was wont to produce alacri∣ty of obedience, and render their service a pleasure. The remembrance of it both em∣bitters their grief, and makes it trickle plentifully down their honest cheeks.

<HEAD>AN INTERESTING DESCRIPTION OF A GOOD MAN IN THE VIEWS OF DEATH.</HEAD>
<P>THE sufferer, all patient and adoring, submits to the divine will; and, by submission, becomes superior to his affliction. He is sensibly touched with the disconsolate state of his attendants; and pierced with an anxious concern for his wife and his children. His wise who will soon be a destitute widow; his children, who will soon be helpless or∣phans. <Q>Yet, though cast down, not in de∣spair.</Q> He is greatly refreshed, by his trust in the everlasting covenant, and his hope of approaching glory. Religion gives
<PB N="139" REF="030558_0136_0FE7CBFE597F9680"/>a dignity to distress. At each interval of ease, he comforts his very comforters, and suffers with all the majesty of woe.</P>
<P>The soul, just going to abandon the tot∣tering clay, collects all her force, and exerts her last efforts. The good man raises him∣self on his pillow; extends a kind hand to his servants, which is bathed in tears; takes an affecting farewell of his friends; clasps his wife in a feeble embrace; kisses the dear pledges of their mutual love; and then pours out all that remains of life and of strength, in the following words;— <Q>I die my dear children: but GOD, the everlasting GOD, will be with you.—Though you lose an <HI>earthly</HI> parent, you have a Father in Hea∣ven who lives for evermore.—Nothing, <HI>no∣thing</HI> but an unbelieving heart, and irreligi ous life, can ever separate you from the regards of his providence—from the en∣dearments of his love.</Q></P>
<P>He could proceed no farther. His heart was full; but utterance failed.—After a short pause, with difficulty, great difficulty, he added;— <Q>You the dear partner of my soul, you are now the only protector of our orphans.—I leave you under a weight of cares.—But GOD, who defendeth the cause of the widow—GOD, whose promise is faithfulness and truth—God hath said <HI>I

<P>Here he fainted; sell back upon the bed; and lay, for some minutes, berest of his sens∣es. As a taper, upon the very point of ex∣tinction, is sometimes suddenly rekindled, and leaps into a quivering flame: so life, be∣fore it totally expired, gave a parting strug∣gle, and once more looked abroad from the opening eye lids.—He would fain have spoke; fain have uttered the sentence, he began. More than once he essayed; but the organs of his speech were become like a broken vessel, and nothing but the obstruct∣ing phlegm rattled in his throat. His as∣pect, however, spoke asfection inexpressible. With all the sather, all the husband still liv∣ing in his looks; he takes one more view of those dear children, whom he had so often beheld with a parental triumph. He turns∣his dying eyes on that beloved woman, whom he never beheld but with a glow of delight. Fixed in this posture, amidst smiles of love, and under a gleam of Heaven, he shines out his last.</P>

<P>A beam or two finds its way through the grates, and reflects a feeble glimmer from the nails of the coffins.

No vulgar dead are deposited here. The most illustrious and right honourable have claimed this for their last retreat. And, indeed, they retain somewhat of a shadowy pre-eminence.

<HEAD>TULIPS AND PINKS, EMBLEMS OF THE DIF∣FERENCES AMONG CHRISTIANS.</HEAD>
<P>IN a grove of tulips, or a knot of pinks, one perceives a difference in almost eve∣ry individual. Scarce any two are are turn∣ed and tinctured exactly alike. * Each al∣lows himself a little particularity in his dress, though all belong to one family.— A pretty emblem this of the smaller diffe∣rences between Protestant Christians. There are modes in religion which admit of varia∣tion, without prejudice to sound faith or real holiness. Just as the drapery, on these pic∣tures of the spring, may be formed after a

If any strife subsists, let it be to follow our Divine Master most closely, in humility of heart, and unblameableness of life. Let it be to serve one another most readily, in all the kind offices of a cordial friendship. Thus shall we be united, though distinguished; united in the same grand fundamentals, tho' distinguished by some small circumstantials, united in one important bond of brotherly love, though distinguished by some slight∣er peculiarities of sentiment.</P>

<HEAD>FLOWERS POURTRAYED IN LIVELY CO∣LOURS.</HEAD>
<P>ACIRCUMSTANCE, recommending and endearing the flowry creation, is their regular succession. They make not their appearance all at once, but in an or∣derly rotation. While a proper number of these obliging retainers are in waiting, the
<PB N="154" REF="030558_0151_0FE7CC3957E92F70"/>others abscond, but hold themselves in a posture of service, ready to take their turn, and fill each his respective s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation the instant it becomes vacant.—The snow-drop, fore∣most of the lovely train, breaks her way through the frozen soil, in order to present her early compliments to her Lord. Dress∣ed in the robe of innocency, she steps forth, fearless of danger, long before the trees have ventured to unfold their leaves, even while the iciles are pendent on our houses. Next peeps out the crocus, but cautiously, and with an air of timidity. She hears the howling blasts, and skulks close to her low situation. Afraid she seems, to make large excursions from her root, while so many ruffian winds are abroad, and scouring along the aether.—Nor is the violet last in this shining embassy of the year. Which, with all the embellishments that would grace a royal garden, condescends to line our hedges and grow at the feet of briars. Freely, and without any solicitation, she distributes the bounty of her emissive sweets; while herself, with an exemplary humility, retires from sight, seeking rather to administer pleasure, than to win admiration. Em∣blem, expressive emblem, of those modest virtues which delight to bloom in obscuri∣ty; which extend a cheering influence to multitudes, who are scarce acquainted with the source of their comforts! Motive, en∣gaging
<PB N="155" REF="030558_0152_0FE7CC3AE693CB20"/>motive, to that ever active benefi∣cence, which stays not for the importunity of the distressed, but anticipates their suit, and prevents them with the blessing of its goodness! <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See herein a picture of charity without oftentation, beauty without vanity, and merit without pride.</NOTE></P>
<P>The poor polyanthus, that lately adorned the border with their sparkling beauties, and transplanted into our windows, gave us a fresh entertainment, is now more; I saw her complexion fade; I perceived her breath decay; till at length she expired, and dropt into her grave.—Scarce have we sustained this loss, but in comes the auricu∣la, and more than retrieves it. Arrayed she comes, in a splendid variety of amiable forms, with an eye of chrystal, and garments of the most glossy sattin, exhaling perfume, and powdered with silver. Scarce one a∣mong them but is dignified with the charac∣ter of renown, or has the honour to repre∣sent some celebrated toast. But these also, notwithstanding their illustrious titles, have exhausted their whole stock of fragrance, and are mingled with the meanest dust.— Who could forbear grieving at their depar∣ture, did not the tulips begin to raise them∣selves on their fine wands, or stately stalks? they slush the paterre with one of the gayest
<PB N="156" REF="030558_0153_0FE7CC40A7FF6910"/>dresses that blooming nature wears. Here one may behold the innocent wantonness of beauty. Here she indulges a thousand freaks, and sports herself in the most charming di∣versity of colours. Yet I should wrong her, were I to call her a coquette; because she plays her lovely changes, not to enkindle dissolute affections, but to display her Crea∣tor's glory.—Soon arises the anemone, en∣circled at the bottom with a spreading robe, and rounded at the top into a beautiful dome, In its loosely flowing mantle you may ob∣serve a noble negligence; in its gently bend∣ing tufts, the nicest symmetry. I would term it the fine gentleman of the garden; because it seems to have learnt the singular address of uniting simplicity with refine∣ment, of reconciling art and ease.—The same month has the merit of producing the renunculus. All bold and graceful it ex∣pands the riches of its foliage, and acquires by degrees, the loveliest enamel in the world. Methinks nature improves in her opera∣tions. Her latest strokes are most masterly. To crown the collection, she introduces the carnation, which captivates every eye with a noble spread of graces, and charms every sense with a profusion of exquisite odours. This single flower has ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>red in itself the perfections of all the preceding. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣ment it appears, it so commands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n∣tion, that we scarce regret the absence of the

<HEAD>THE TIME, ORDER AND ADJUSTMENT OT FLOWERS, EVIDENCE THE CREATOR'S WISDOM.</HEAD>
<P>LET me add one remark upon the ad∣mirable adjustment of every particu∣lar, relating to these fine colonies planted in the parterre.—With such accuracy and correctness is their structure finished, that any the least conceivable alteration would very much impair their perfection. Should you see, for instance, the nice disposition of the tulips attire fly abroad, disorderly and irregular, like the flaunting wood-bine; should the jessamine rear her diminutive head on those grand columns which support the holliho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k; should the erect and manly as∣pect of the piony hang down with a pensive air, like the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the hyacinth; should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/>
<PB N="158" REF="030558_0155_0FE7CC46CE6E0010"/>fringes which edge the pink, or the gaudy stains which bedrop the iris; should those tapering pillars which arise in the mid∣dle of its vase, and tipt with golden pen∣dants, give such a lustre to the surrounding panels of alabaster—should those shrink and disappear like the chives which cover the heart of the anemone.—In many of these cases, would not the transposition be fan∣tastical and aukward? in all to the apparent prejudice of every individual?</P>
<P>Again; with regard to the time of their appearing, this circumstance is settled by a remarkable foresight and precaution.— What would become of the sailor, if, in ve∣ry stormy weather, he should raise a lofty mast, and croud it with all his canvass? Such would be the ill effect, if the most stately species of flowers should presume to come aboad in the blustering months. Ah! how would they rue the imprudent bold∣ness! Therefore, those only that shoot the shortest stems, and display the smallest spread of leaves, or (if you please) carry the least sail, are launched amidst the blow∣ing seasons.—How injudiciously would the perfumer act, if he should unseal his finest essences, and expose them to the northern winds, or wintry rains! our blooming artists of the aromatic profession, at least the most delicate among them, seem perfectly aware
<PB N="159" REF="030558_0156_0FE7CC4A33FEAB40"/>of the consequences of such a procedure. Accordingly they postpone their odorife∣rous treasures, till a ferener air, and more unclouded skies grant a protection to their amiable traffic, till they are under no more apprehensions of having their spicy cells rifled by rude blasts, or drowned in inces∣sant showers.</P>

<P>THE earth is assigned to us for a dwell∣ing. —The skies are stretched over us like a magnificent canopy, dyed in the purest azure, and beautified now with pic∣tures of floating silver, now with colourings of reflected crimson.—The grass is spread under us, as a spacious carpet, wove with silken threads of green, and damasked with flowers of every hue.—The sun, like a gol∣den lamp, is hung out in the ethereal vault; and pours his effulgence all the day to light∣en our paths.—When night approaches, the moon takes up the friendly office, and the stars are kindled in twinkling myriads, to cheer the darkness with their milder lus∣tre, not disturb our repose by too intense a glare—The clouds, besides the rich paint∣ings they hang around the heavens, act the part of a shifting screen, and defend us, by their seasonable interposition, from the scorching beams of summer. May we not also regard them as the great watering-pots of the globe? which, wafted on the wings of the wind, dispense their moisture evenly through the universal garden; and fructify, with their showers, whatever our hand plants.—The fields are our exhaustless gra∣nary. —The ocean is our vast reservoir.—
<PB N="161" REF="030558_0158_0FE7CC518C7D6B10"/>The animals spend their strength to dis∣patch our business, resign their clothing to eplenish our wardrobe, and surrender their very lives to provide for our tables.—In short, every element is a store-house of con∣veniencies; every season brings us the choicest productions; all nature is our ca∣terer. —And, which is a most endearing re∣commendation of these favours, they are all as lovely as they are useful. You ob∣serve nothing mean or inelegant. All is clad in beauty's fairest robe, and regulated by proportion's nicest rule. The whole scene exhibits a fund of pleasures to the imagination, at the same time that it more than supplies all our wants.</P>

<HEAD>THE COOLNESS OF EVENING TWILIGHT, AND ITS BENEFITS.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER all the ardors of the sultry day, how reviving is this coolness!—This gives new verdure to the fading plants; new vivacity to the withering flowers; and a more exquisite fragrance to their mingled scents.—By this, the air also receives a new force, and is qualified to exert itself with greate activity.—This I might call the grand alembec of nature, which dislils her

Incessent heat would rob us of their benefi∣cial agency, and oblige them to evaporate in imperceptible exhalations. Turbulent winds, or even the gentler motions of Au∣rora's fan, would dissipate the rising vapours, and not suffer them to form a coalition.— But, favoured by the stillness, and condens∣ed by the coolness of the night, they unite in pearly drops, create that finely tempered humidity, which cheers the vegetable world, as sleep exhilirates the animal.</P>

<HEAD>THE ADVANTAGES OF SOLITUDE.</HEAD>
<P>THE world is a troubled ocean; and who can erect stable purposes, on its fluctuating waves? The world is a school of wrong, and who does not feel himself warp∣ing to its penicious influences? on this sea of glass, how insensibly we slide from our own stedfastness! some sacred truth, which was struck in lively characters on our souls, is obscured; if not obliterated. Some wor∣thy resolution, which heaven had wrought in our breasts, is shaken if not overthrown. Some inticing vanity; which we had solemn∣ly renounced, again practises its wiles, a|

How often has an unwary glance kindled a fever of ir∣regular desire in our hearts? how often has a word of applause dropt luscious poison in∣to our ears; or some disrespectful expression raised a gust of passion into our bosoms? our innocence is of so tender a constitution, that it suffers in the promiscuous c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oud. Our pu∣rity is of so delicate a complexion, that it scarce touches on the world, without con∣tracting a stain. We see, we hear, with pe∣ril.</P>
<P>But here safety dwells. Every medling and intrusive avocation is secluded. Si∣lence holds the door against the strife of tongues, and all the impertinences of idle conversation. The busy swarm of vain i∣mages, and cajoling temptations which be∣set us, with a buzzing importunity, amidst the gaities of life, are chased by these thick∣ening shades.—Here I may, without disturb∣ance, commune with my own heart, and learn the best of sciences, to know myself. Here the soul may rally her dissipated pow∣ers, and grace recover its native energy.— This is the opporcunity to rectify every e∣vil impression, to expel the poison, and guard against the contagion of corrupting examples. This is the place where I may, with advantage, apply mysels to subdue the rebel within, and be master, not of a sceptre,
<PB N="180" REF="030558_0177_0FE7CC98F9DAD638"/>but of myself.—Throng then, ye ambitious, the levees of the powerful; I will be punc∣tual in my assignations with solitude.

<HEAD>THE BENEFITS OF AFFLICTION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN sickness has drawn a veil o∣ver the gaity of our hearts, when misfortunes have eclipsed the splendor of our outward circumstances, how many important convictions present themselves with the brightest evidence!

<P>WELCOME, thrice welcome, this auspicious gift of Providence, to enliven the nocturnal gloom, and line with silver the raven-coloured mantle of night! How desirable to have our summer evenings illuminated! that we may be able to tread the dewy meads, and breathe the delicious fragrance of our gardens; especially when the sultry heats render it irksome and fati∣guing, to walk a broad by day.—How cheer∣ing to the shepherd, the use of this univer∣sal lantern; as he tends his fleecy charge, or late consigns them to their hurdled cots!

<P>THE love of God, that supremely glor∣ious, and supremely gracious Being, is of all other tempers, the most delightful and divine. A sacred flower, which its ear∣ly bud is happiness, and in its full bloom is heaven.

<HEAD>ON THE Religious Education OF DAUGHTERS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it. <HI>Proverbs, xxii. 6.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT has long been a prevailing report, that, among persons of education and distinction, true religon is very rare. This, I would hope, is an invidious rumour, rather than a true representation of the case. May it not be an attifice of the grand enemy? calculated to bring the best and noblest of causes into disrepute: as though politeness and piety were inconsistent: as though grace and good-breeding were irreconcileable.— Is then the faith of Christ quite fatal to refin∣ed
<PB N="206" REF="030558_0203_0FE7CCF073429EA0"/>manners? as the rod of Moses was to the counterfeit miracles of d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>gicians. No; it is rather like the influence of the sanctuary on the rod of Aaron: which, while it remained at a distance from the tabernacle, was a dry, sapless and barren stick; but, when deposited before the ark, was quick∣ened into vegetable light, was adorned with a milk-white bloom, and enriched with full grown fruit; or as the sacred historian expresses this surprising fact, "It brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds." <HI>Numb.</HI> xxii. 6.</P>
<P>I find, upon the list of saints, the most re∣nowned kings, and victorious generals, the a∣blest politicians, and the greatest philosophers men that have bid the sun stand still, and prolong the parting day; have laid an em∣bargo upon darkness; and protracted the shades of night; have commanded the ground to cleave asunder, and transmit their presumptuous foes to a strange and inevita∣ble des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ction; have divided the impetuous waves, and led their followers to safety and to conquest thought the depths of the sea.

<P><PB N="207" REF="030558_0204_0FE7CCF20248BF50"/>
I myself have known various persons, ad∣mired for their accomplished behaviour, and revered for their exalted station, who have thought it their highest honour to be servants of Jesus Christ. My excellent friend Camillus, at whose house I now re∣side, is one of the number. I cannot refrain from giving a portrait of Camillus; or rather of a few of his most distinguishing features: for, to paint him in full proportion, as he daily appears, in all the mild, the benign majesty of domestic authority, parental go∣vernment, and Christian zeal—To do this, would require a much abler hand than mine.</P>
<P>Camillus, not long ago, entertained in his house a young clergyman, who was always treated with a respect suitable to the dignity of his office, and the piety of his behaviour. I having larely presented the worthy ecclesi∣astic to a living, and always requiring re∣sidence on the benefice, he is now destitute of a chaplain. Remembering, however, that all Christians are spiritual priests; he thinks it no dishonour to have an imme∣diate and personal audience with the King of Heaven; not acting at all out of character to repesent the wants of his houshold, with his own mouth, at the throne of grace.</P>
<P>Before supper is introduced, the evening
<PB N="208" REF="030558_0205_0FE7CCF7B7914BC8"/>incense ascends. This rather than a later hour, is pitched upon, that the little congre∣gation may join in the sacred service, with a lively devotion. After a plentiful meal, when the limbs are weary, people, even though kneeling, and in the presence of God, are more inclined to nod, than to pour out their souls; are very apt to mistake the cu∣shion for a pillow.—No servant is allowed to be absent, one only excepted, whose presence in the kitchen is absolutely necessary. Ac∣quainted with their master's resolution, they are careful, so to manage their affairs, and dispatch their business, that no unavoidable obstacle may intervene to detain them from the stated worship.</P>
<P>When all are assembled, without either tumultuous disorder in their approach, or a slovenly negligence in their apparel, a chap∣ter is read. Camillus makes the choice.— He imagines it not so useful for his family, whose momories are weak, and their capaci∣ties scanty, to read the lesson for the day.— He has, therefore, selected some of the most instructive and animating portions of scrip∣ture; and judges it adviseable to peruse these again and again, rather than to go regularly through the whole inspired writings.—The servants take it by turns to read, which im∣proves them in the practice, and keeps them awake. If any of them discovers a disposi|
<PB N="209" REF="030558_0206_0FE7CCF947CA9548"/>of sleep, to him the office is sure to be assigned.</P>
<P>When the chapter is finished, Camillus singles out some one verse, of very weighty and edifying import, which, for the space of five or six minutes, he explains, applies, and affectionately urges upon their consciences. This done, with great seriousness and pro∣found reverence, he offers up evening pray∣ers. His prayers consists of short sentences, and the whole is performed in a little time. Every part is pronounced with that deliber∣ate slowness and solemn accent, which com∣mand attention and create awe. He makes a very perceivable pause at the close of each petition that every one may have leisure to add, in silence, a hearty amen; and to recol∣lect the merits of that blessed Redeemer, which render every thanksgiving acceptable, and every supplication successful.</P>
<P>In the morning, before breakfast, the wor∣ship of the living God is renewed. At this juncture Camillus omits the chapter, but re∣quires one of his domestics to repeat the verse on which he enlarged the proceeding night. None knows which shall be called to this task, therefore every one is obilged to be properly prepared. He throws the sub∣stance of his exhortation into a few scaren∣ing and interesting questions, which he ad∣dresses
<PB N="210" REF="030558_0207_0FE7CCFEF6201440"/>to one of his children or servants— for, in this prespect, no difference is made.— All are equally enjoined to remember. Some times he encourages those whose answers shew that they have given diligent heed to his instructions. Sometimes he puts on an air of severity, mixed with tenderness, and re∣proves the notoricusly negligent. Always he re-inculcates the principal points, charg∣ing them to retain the doctrines in their me∣mory, and revolve them in their thoughts, while they are pursuing their respective busi∣ness —These doctrines are the seed of faith, the root of godliness. Unless these be lod∣ged in the mind, and operate on the heart, he never expects to have his domestics com∣mence true believers, or real Christians. No more than the husbandman can reasonably expect a crop in harvest without sowing his field, or the florist promise himself a blow of tulips, without planting his parterre.</P>
<P>I have given a glimpse of Camillus at the head of his family; let me now shew my fa∣vourite in another attitude.—Camillus is convinced that no trust is of superior or of equal importance to the tuitionary cultivati∣on of an immortal soul. As providence has blessed him with two fine daughters, their present and future happiness is the reigning object of his care. He has no interest so much at heart as to give them a truly refined education, such as may render them an orna∣ment
<PB N="211" REF="030558_0208_0FE7CD008C4CCDC0"/>and a blessiing to society, while they pass the time of thier sojourning here be∣low, and may train them up for a state of e∣verlasting bliss, when the world and its tran∣sitory scenes shall be no more.</P>
<P>Camillus never could persuade himself to admire the maxims of prudence said to be gathered from the extravagant rant of our tragedies; and less is his esteem for those modest dispositions, which people pretend to imbibe from the lucious gallantries of comedy; for which reason he has no impati∣ent desire to secure for Miss Metissa and Miss Serena a place in the front box.—Howe∣ver, as we are apt immoderately to covet what is absolutely forbidden, he has himself attended them, once or twice, to the thea∣trical entertainments and public diversions; thinking it much the safest method, that their curiosity should be gratified under his own inspection and hoping to make them sensible how much they endanger their vir∣tue, who too often frequent them; how shamefully they debase their affections, who are passionately fond of them; and what mere phantoms they follow, who seek for satisfaction in such delusory delights.</P>
<P>They learn to dance, in order to require a genteel air, and a graceful demeanor; not to shine at a ball, or win the worthless ad∣miration
<PB N="212" REF="030558_0209_0FE7CD0520B11078"/>of fops.—He is content to have them unacquainted with the wild and roman∣tic fables of heathen poetry. Nor is under any painful apprehensions of damping the sprightliness of their temper, though they have no taste for the chimerical adven∣tures of our romances, and are strangers to the loose intrigues of our novels; being fully persuaded, that there is as much sound sense as smartness of thought in that cele∣brated saying,</P>
<Q><L>"Retire, and read your bible to be gay:</L>
<L>"There truths abound of sov'reign aid to peace"?</L></Q>
<P>He has introduced them to the knowledge of history, and its instructive facts. They have atolerable idea of the four universal mo∣narchies, so eminent for their great evenst, and so circumstantially foretold in scripture. They have been led through the most re∣markable transactions of our own country, and are pretty well acquainted with the pre∣sent state of Europe. They have all along been taught to observe the wonderful revo∣lutions of empires, and the adorable pro∣cedure of Providence; that they may discern how <HI>the fashion of this world passeth away; and</HI> and how <HI>happy are the people,</HI> how happy are the persons <HI>who have the</HI> LORD for their GOD. They have been taught to observe the hon∣ourable success that has usually attended the
<PB N="213" REF="030558_0210_0FE7CD07DA9EAAB0"/>practice of integrity, guided by prudence; to∣gether with the scandal and ruin which have always pursued folly in her senseless ram∣bles, and dogged vice to her horrid haunts. That they may see the rocks on which some have split, and avoid the destructive tract; see the road which has conducted others to the haven of happiness, and steer the same auspicious course.</P>
<P>They have been initiated in geography, and understand the several divisions of the globe; the extent of its principal kingdoms, and the manners of their various inhabitants. They will tell you the peculiar commodi∣ties which each climate produces; whence comes the tea that furnishes their breakfast, and whence the sugar that renders it pala∣table: what mountains supply them with wines, and what islands send them their spices; in what groves the silk-worms spin the materials for their cloaths, and what mines supply them with the dimonds that sparkle in their earrings.—A screen covered with a set of coloured maps, and a custom of referring from the public papers to those beautiful draughts, has rendered the acqui∣sition of this knowledge a diversion rather than a task, has enticed them into a valuable branch of science, under the inviting disguise of amusement. This serves to enlarge their apprehension of things, gives them magnifi∣cent
<PB N="214" REF="030558_0211_0FE7A772CA1E6C70"/>cent thoughts of the great Greater, and may help to suppress that silly self-admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, which p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ompts so many pretty idols to fan∣cy themselves the only considerable crea∣tures under heaven.</P>
<P>They spell to perfection, and have ob∣tained this art by a sort of play, rather than by laborious application. Whenever they asked any little gratification, it has been their papa's custom to make them spell the word, which if they performed aright, they seldom sailed to succeed in their request.— They are mistresses of the needle; and the youngest, whose genius inclines that way, is expert in using the pencil. Music is their recreation, not their business. The eldest to a skilful finger, adds a melodious and well regulated voice. She often entertains me with singing an anthem to her harpsichord. Entertains did I say?—she really edisies me. These truly excellent performances exalt the desires, and compose the affections; they in∣spire 02 such a serenity of delight, as leaves nei∣ther a sting on the conscience, nor a stain on the imagination. Methinks they bring us a little antepast of heaven, and tune cursouls for its harmonious joys.</P>
<P>Thoroughly versed in the most practical parts of arithmetic, they have each her week, wherein to be intrusted with the manage∣ment
<PB N="215" REF="030558_0212_0FE7CD0F56A7C248"/>of a sum of money. This they dis∣burse, as cir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tances require, for the smaller necessaries of the family. Of this they keep an exact account, and make a re∣gular entry of each particular in their day∣book.— Not long ago a tenant of inferior rank came to Camillus with his rent: instead of receiving it himself, he referred him to Miss Serena. You would have been delight∣ed to observe the behaviour of our little land∣lady on this occasion; the engaging conde∣scension with which she addressed the honest rustic; the tender good-nature with which she enquired after his dame and the family at home; the ready dexterity with which she wrote and subscribed a proper receipt; and, above all, her amiable generosity in return∣ing half a crown to buy a copy-book for his eldest son, who he said, "was just going in∣to joining hand, but the feared would never come to spell or write half so well as her la∣dyship."</P>
<P>Though Camillus is careful to ground them betimes in the rules of oeconomy, he is equally careful to cultivate a spirit of discreet beneficence. A few days ago, when my friend and his lady were abroad, Miss Metissa was informed of a poor woman in the parish, just brought to bed, after a long and hard labour; who, being unhappily married to a sot of a fellow, was, at a time when the choicest com∣forts
<PB N="216" REF="030558_0213_0FE7CD1485777D88"/>were scarcely sufficient, destitute of the meanest conveniences. Upon hearing the calamitous case, she immediately dis∣patched a servant with a crown from her weekly stock; part to buy for the afflicted creature some present accomodations, and part to defray the expences at such a juncture unavoidable; but gave a strict charge, that the whole should be employed for the re∣lief of the distressed mother and her helpless infant, none of it fingered or enjoyed by the worthless drone her husband. When Ca∣millus returned, he was so pleased with this seasonable and well judged charity, that, be∣sides his commendation and caresses, he far∣ther rewarded our considerate and matron like benefactress, by making her a present of Clarissa; for he always contrives to make what tends to their improvement, the mat∣ter of their reward. If they have commit∣ted a fault, they are forbid the priveledge of using their maps. If they have behaved in a becoming manner, their recompence is, not a peice of money, or a paper of sweet∣meats, but some new instruction on the globe, some new lesson on the harpsichord, which may at once delight and improve them.</P>
<P>To prevent a haughty carriage, and to worm out all inordinate self-love, he teaches them to consider their neighbours as mem∣bers of the same universal family, and chil∣dren
<PB N="217" REF="030558_0214_0FE7CD16DB47EAD0"/>of the same Almighty Father. How∣ever poor in their circumstances, or mean in their aspect, they are the objects of God's in∣finiciely tender regards.—Of that God, who has given his own Son to suffer death for their pardon, and has prepared a heaven of endless bliss for their final reception; for which reason they should despise none, but honour all; should be as ready to do them good, as the hand is ready to sooth the eye when if smarts, or ease the head when it aches. One afternoon, when he was going to treat them with an orange, he bid each of them bring a fine toy, lately received for a present. It was made in the shape of a knife, the han∣dle of ivory and inlaid with the gayest co∣lours; the blade of glass most dazzlingly bright, but without an edge. "Cut the orange in two," said their papa. When they both tri∣ed with their pretty knives, and, to their no small mortification, both failed. He fur∣nished them with another of more ordinary appearance, but tolerably sharp. With this they easily pierced the rhind, and came at the delicious juice. "Who now," said Ca∣millus, "would not prefer one such servicea∣ble, though plainutensil, toa hundred of those glittering but worthless trifles? and you, my dear children, if you have no other recom∣mendations than a shewy person, and the trappings of dress, you will be as contempti∣ble in your generation as that insignificant
<PB N="218" REF="030558_0215_0FE7CD1C1543D130"/>bauble. But, if it is the desire of your hearts and the endeavour of your lives, to be exten∣sively useful, you will gain, and what is bet∣ter, you will deserve respect; your names will be precious, and your memories blessed.</P>
<P>With equal watchfulness he discounte∣nances all those acts of petulant barbarity, which children are so apt to exercise on the reptile creation. He will allow no court of inquisition to be erected within his house; no, not upon the most despicable, or even the noxious animals. The very nuisances that are endued with life, he thinks should be dispatched, not with a lingering butchery but with a merciful expedition. To rend in pieces a poor fly, and feast their eyes with the mangled limbs, shivering and con∣vulsed in the pangs of death; to impale a wretched infect on the needle or bodkin; and, what is still more shocking, to take pleasure in hearing its passionate moan, and seeing its agonizing struggles: such practices he absolutely forbids, as insufferable viola∣tions of nature's law. Such as tend to ex∣tinguish the soft emotions of pity, and inure the mind to a habit of inhumanity.—He often informs his lovely pupils, that every living creature is sensible of pain; that none can be abused in this cruel manner, without suffering very exquisite mitery. To turn their torments into pastime, and make sport
<PB N="219" REF="030558_0216_0FE7CD1E55D4A750"/>with their anguish, is a rigour more than tyrannical, worse than brutal; is the very reverse of that benign Providence, whose <HI>tender mercies are over</HI> ALL <HI>his works.</HI></P>
<P>He proposes to give them a taste of na∣tural philosophy, and to accomodate them with the best microscopes; that the use of <HI>these</HI> instruments, and a spice of <HI>that</HI> know∣ledge, may inspire them with an early ad∣miration of nature's works, and with the deepest veneration of nature's almighty Author. Camillus has no design to fin∣ish a couple of semale philosophers, or to divert their attention from those domestic arts, which are the truest accomplishments of the sex; yet neither would he have his daughters debarred from that rational and exalted delight, which is to be found in con∣templating the curiosities of the great Crea∣tor's cabinet. Why may they not, with∣out departing from their <HI>own,</HI> or encroach∣ing on the <HI>masculine</HI> character, why may they not be acquainted with the accurately nice structure of an animal; or with the process and effects of vegetation? why may they not learn the admirable operations of the air, or the wonderfnl properties of the water? have some general notion of the im∣mense magnitudes, the prodigious distances, and the still more amazing revolutions of the heavenly orbs? he apprehends it very
<PB N="220" REF="030558_0217_0FE7CD2440C864C8"/>practicable to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luct an entertainment with dignity, and order a family with propri∣ety, even while they retain some tolerable idea of these magnisicent laws which regulate the system of the universe.</P>
<P>The microscope, whenever they are in∣clined to amuse themselves, will shew them a prosusion of splendid ornaments, in some of the most common and contemptible ob∣jects. It will shew them gold and embroi∣dery, diamonds and pearl, azure, green, and vermilion, where unassisted eyes behold nothing, but provocatives of their abhor∣rence. This instrument will shew them the brightesh v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nish, and the most curious carving, even in the minutest scraps of ex∣istence. Far more surprising than the ma∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fears of the most dexterous ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ler, is will treat their sight, not with delusive, but with re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> wonders.

<PB N="221" REF="030558_0218_0FE7CD25D199C490"/>delights, which are so apt to inveigle the affections, and debauch the minds of young people.—When philosophy lends her optics, an unclouded morning, beauti∣ful with the rising sun; a clear night, brilli∣ant with innumerable stars; will be a more pleasing spectacle, than the gaudiest illu∣minations of the assembly-room. The me∣lody of birds, and the murmur of sountains; the humming insect, and the sighing gale, will be a higher gratisication then the finest airs of an opera. A field covered with corn or a meadow besprinkled with daisies; a marsh planted with osiers, or a mountain shaded with oaks, will yield a far more agrecable prospect than the most pompous scenes that decorate the stage. Should clouds overcast the heavens, or winter dis∣robe the Rowers; an inquiry into the causes of these grand vicissitudes, will more than compensate the transitory loss. A discove∣ry of the divine wisdom and goodness, in these seemingly disastrous changes, will im∣part gaiety to the most gloomy sky, and make the most unornamented seasons smile.</P>
<P>It is for want of such truly elegant and sa∣tisfactory amusements, that so many ladies of the first distinction, and sinest genius, have no employ for their delicate capacities; but lose their happiness in slights of caprice, or fits of the vapour; lose their time in the most
<PB N="222" REF="030558_0219_0FE7CD2A645BF7D8"/>insipid chat, or the most whimsical vaga∣ries; while thought is a burthen, and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ec∣tion, is a drudgery; solitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ills them with horror and a serious discourse makes them melancholy.</P>
<P>Above all, Camillus is most earnestly desirous to have his tender charge ground∣ed in the principles, and actuated with the spirit of Christianity. No scheme, he is thoroughly persuaded, was ever so wise∣ly calculated to sweeten their tempers, to exalt their affections, and form them to fe∣licity, either in this world, or another. It is therefore his daily endeavour, by the most easy and endearing methods of instruction, to fill their minds with the knowledge of those heavenly doctrines, and win their hearts to the love of that invaluable book in which they are delineated.—He longs to have a sense of God Almighty's goodness impressed on their souls, From this source, under the influences of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nctisying Spirit, he would derive all the graces and all the duties of godliness. With this view he speaks of the divine Majesty, not only as supereminently great, but as most transcen∣dently possessed of every delightful, every charming excellence. He represents all the comforte they enjoy, and every blessing they receive, as the gists of his bountiful hand, and as an earnest of unspea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ably rich∣er
<PB N="223" REF="030558_0220_0FE7CD2D35A5D748"/>favours <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> THEM, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whatever their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Father <HI>commands, forbids, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> proceeds from his overflow∣ing kindness, and is intended for their e∣ternal good, if, by these expedients, he may awaken in their minds an habitual gratitude to their everlasting Benefactor. The ac∣tings of which noble principle are not only frui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful in every good work, but productive of the truest satisfaction; somewhat like the fragrant streams of consecrated incense, which, while they honored the great object of devour worship, regaled with their plea∣sing perfumes.</P>
<P>Nothing is more displeasing to Camillus than the fond flatteries which their injudici∣ous admirers bestow on their shape and com∣plexion, the gracefulness of their carriage, and the vivacity of their wit. He would fain make them sensible that these embel∣lishments are of the lowest value, and most fading nature;—that, if they render their possessors vain and self-conceited, they are far greater blemishes than a hump on the back, a wen in the neck, or stuttering in the speech.—He would have them tho∣roughly convinced, that, notwithstanding all their silks, diamonds, and other marks of their superior circumstances, they are ignor∣ant, guilty, impotent creatures; blind to truths of the last importance; deserving the
<PB N="224" REF="030558_0221_0FE7CD31CEC5C0E8"/>vengcance of etetnal fire, and unable of themselves to think a good thought. That, from such conviction, they may perceive their absolute need of a Saviour: a Saviour in all his offices—as a prophet, to teach them heavenly wisdom—as a priest, to atone for all their many, many sins—as a king, to subdue their iniquities, write his laws in their hearts, and make them, in all their conversation, holy.</P>
<P>In short, the point he chiefly labours, is to work in their hearts a deep, an abiding sense, that God is their supreme, their only good; that the blessed Jesus is the rock of their hopes, and the fountain of their salvati∣on: that all their dependence for acquiring the beauties of holiness, and tasting the joys of the sublimest virtue, is to be placed on the Holy Ghost the comforter.—Amidst all these efforts of his own, he never fails to to plead that precious promise of our un∣changeable Jehovah; <HI>I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thy offspring; and they shall grow up</HI> in knowledge and grace, <HI>as willows by the water-co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s.</HI></P>
<P>A lady of brilliant parts, but no very ex∣traordinary piety, told Camillus, that he would spoil the pretty dears; would extin∣guish that decent pride, and fondness for pleasure, which are shining qualifications in
<PB N="225" REF="030558_0222_0FE7CD33E3D654E8"/>an accomplished young lady, which gave her an clevation of sentiment, and a delica∣cy of taste, greatly superior to the ignoble vulgar.—To whom he replied: "Far from extirpating their passions, I only attempt to turn them into a right channel, and di∣rect them to the worthiest objects. Willing I am that they should have a decent ambiti∣on; an ambition, not to catch the the giddy coxcomb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s eye, or be the hackneyed toast of rakes; but to please their parents, to make a husband happy, and to promote the glory of God.—They may entertain a fondness for pleasure; but such pleasure as will enno∣ble their souls, afford them substantial satis∣faction, and prepare them for the fruition of immortal bliss.—Let them be covetous also, if you please, Madam; but covetous of redeeming their time, and of gaining intel∣lectual improvement; covetous of those riches, which no moth can corrupt, nor thief steal, which neither time nor death can de∣stroy."</P>
<P>In all these instances of parental sollcitude, his beloved Emilia takes her constant, her willing share. Contributes her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dvice in every plan that is concerted, and her hear∣ty concurrence in every expedient that is executed; every expedient for polishing the human jewel, and making their manners as saultless as their forms.—May the God of
<PB N="226" REF="030558_0223_0FE7CD3911964608"/>infinite goodness, the sacred source of all perfection prosper their endeavours! that, as the young ladies are adorned in their per∣sons, with native beauty, they may be en∣riched in their understandings, with refined knowledge, and dignified in their souls with the spirit of the blessed Jesus.—Then, sure∣ly, more amiable objects the eye of man can∣not behold: more desirable partners the heart of man cannot wish.</P>
