<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THAT <HI>Mankind Universally</HI> shall, in the final issue of the Gospel plan of mercy, be delivered from the bondage of corruption, and be admitted to the felicity of the sons of God, is no <HI>novel doctrine,</HI> as many may be ready to imagine. It was (as some writers upon this subject have observed) received as a <HI>revealed truth</HI> by Origen and Clement of Alexandria, who both lived in the latter end of the Second Century, And it appears from Augustin, Jerom, and other celebrated writers, in their day, that it was not then either a <HI>new</HI> or <HI>uncommon</HI> tenet. And, in later times, a variety of books have been published in favour of it, in the French, High-Dutch, Low-Dutch and English languages. There is also an ingenious piece▪ written in French by a noble minister of the court of the king of Prussia, stiled <HI>A Treatise on the Universal Resti∣tution of the Creation.</HI> A considerable number of other books, upon the same subject, are now extant in <HI>English.</HI> I shall only mention one or two out of many others. <HI>Jeremiah White,</HI> chap∣lain to Oliver Cromwel, and an eminently pious, good man, has writ a large book, in <HI>Vindication of God's goodness to be manifested, at last, in
<PB N="ii" REF="017489_0003_0FA1239DEEF4E3A8"/>
the recovery of the whole lower creation from the fall.</HI> From this book many of the following extracts are made: <HI>Dr. David Hartley,</HI> in his <HI>ob∣servations upon man,</HI> has several chapters upon <HI>salvation for all men</HI>; from which I may collect some thoughts in the following work. I shall say of him, he was a man of known serious piety, a disciple of Mr. <HI>John Wesley,</HI> and in common with him and all his followers, a believer in the <HI>Restoration of all mankind, in God's time and way, to final happiness.</HI></P>
<P>It may not be unseasonable to add here, that it is freely and fully acknowledged, by all the above writers, that <HI>many,</HI> among the sons and daughters of Adam, will pass through a state of <HI>unutterable misery</HI>; before they will be pre∣pared for, and admitted to the joys of God's presence, in the heavenly world.</P>
<P>This I judge proper to mention, because the doctrine of <HI>Universal Salvation</HI> has in this, and some other towns, been held forth by a stranger, who has, of himself, assumed the character of a <HI>preacher,</HI> in direct contradiction not only to all the before mentioned writers, but to the <HI>whole tenor of the New-Testament-books, from their beginning to their end.</HI> According to this <HI>preacher,</HI> a man may go to heaven, notwith∣standing all the sins he has been guilty of in the
<PB N="iii" REF="017489_0004_0FA1239FF1FD7470"/>
course of his life. Such a doctrine looks very like an <HI>encouragement</HI> to <HI>Libertinism,</HI> and falls in with the scheme of too many in this degenerate age, who, under pretence of <HI>promoting religion, undermine it at the very root.</HI> It is certainly fitted to this end, and has already had this effect upon many, especially of our younger people, who, by means of it, have lost all sense of religion, and given themselves up to the most criminal excesses! If this kind of preaching is encouraged, it may prove as hurtful to <HI>civil society</HI> as to <HI>religion.</HI></P>
<P>Would to God it might be realized as an <HI>undoubted truth,</HI> that there is the same reason, from scripture, to believe there is a <HI>HELL</HI> as a <HI>HEAVEN.</HI> And those who are infidels as to the former, would do well to take care lest they should know, from their <HI>own experience,</HI> the <HI>horrors</HI> of that <HI>dreadful place.</HI></P>
<P>The doctrine held forth, in the following extracts is capable (as is the truth with every other doctrine) of being perverted and abused. If any should be so disingenuous, as to turn <HI>this grace into wantonness,</HI> they can reflect the blame no where but on themselves, if they are made to suffer, God only knows how <HI>long,</HI> or to what an <HI>awful degree,</HI> in the future state.</P>

<HEAD>Salvation for all Men.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER some pertinent observations, the pious and ingenious Mr. <HI>White</HI> proceeds in the fol∣lowing manner.—"And here I do, in the fear of God, most humbly prostrate myself before his divine majesty, and in the deepest sense of my own darkness and distance from him, do, with all my might, beg of that in∣finite goodness I am endeavouring to represent to others, that if something like to this platform and prospect of things be not agreeable to that revealed and natural light he hath given to us, that my undertaking may be interrupted; my design fall; and that the Lord would pardon my attempt. And I know he will do so, for he hath given me to have no further concern in this matter, than as I apprehend it to be a most glo∣rious truth, witnessed to both by the scriptures of truth, and by the most essential principles of our own reason, and which will be found so at the last opening of the gospel, to recover, in that opening, a degenerate world. But if this be a true representation of the glorious design of the ever blessed goodness of the great God, who is goodness itself; and if the holy scriptures and right reason do bear witness unto it, how clear, how fair, how open lies the way before us to justify the sovereign power, and dispose of God, which he exercises by Election and Reprobation too, with all the methods he uses in his holy and glorious wisdom and prudence, in giving way to the entrance of sin, and then inflaming the anguish of it by the law, that he
<PB N="2" REF="017489_0006_0FA123A0F000AE58"/>
may thereby have occasion to glorify his wrath against it, and his justice; and so make his way to the more glorious illustration of his grace and love in the close.</P>
<P>In this account and prospect, there is, as we shall see in the sequel of this discourse, nothing omitted, nothing excluded, of all the ways and methods of God with men, which have been, by good minds, variously con∣tended for. Here his universal grace doth no longer thrust out his special and peculiar favour. <HI>Reprobation</HI> here will be found consisting with <HI>Election,</HI> yea, <HI>Dam∣nation</HI> itself with <HI>Salvation.</HI> Here all those knots which other systems of divinity have tied faster, are in a great measure loofned. Here all those difficulties, in the Christian religion, which have so long perplexed the more thinking and enquiring minds, are, if not quite removed, at least made so easy, that we may, with some contentment and pleasure, wait for that state which can alone perfectly satisfy us. And yet, all this while, nothing of moment in Christianity is any way assaulted and shaken, but all is much better established and confirmed, being hereby made one entire piece most pure and pleasant, from the highest truth, and the highest good, meeting both in one, throughout the whole contrivance.</P>
<P>Here all those false, barbarous and monstrous re∣presentations of a God are taken away, which have hitherto hindred so many minds (otherwise ingenuous) from owning him, for fear they should, at the same time they acknowledge the supreme Being, reproach and blaspheme him, by leaving out the highest and most essential perfection of the Deity, which is good∣ness, or at least making it more narrow and contracted than that of a finite imperfect creature.</P>
<P>Here, in a word, all the scenes of time, and all things done therein, are with at unspeakable pleasure disco∣vered
<PB N="3" REF="017489_0007_0FA123A1AF9FB238"/>
and seen to be invironed, encompassed, enfolded in the arms and embraces of eternity, lying down and resting there, as in the end to which they were eter∣nally ordained.</P>
<P>He is not a Christian, he is not a man, he hath put off the tenderness and bowels of a man, he hath lost humanity itself, he hath not so much charity as Dives expressed in Hell, that cannot readily cry out,— <HI>this is good news, if it be true:</HI> that will not say <HI>Amen</HI> to it, provided it be agreeable to God, and what his word will countenance and own. For under no other law or condition can we groundedly rejoice in any doctrine, than as it bears the impress and stamp of divine authority, and tends to his glory, to which all must bow; for heaven itself must pass away, rather than the gospel be innovated, or another gospel broach∣ed, how gratifying or acceptable soever to our fleshly minds. Upon this supposition, therefore, I conclude this doctrine must be acceptable and welcome to every <HI>good man.</HI></P>
<P>I have often observed, with admiration and pleasure, those most affectionate irruptions of spirit and pangs of love in Moses and Paul. <HI>Blot me out of thy book,</HI> says one; <HI>I could be accursed from Christ,</HI> says the other: for the sake of my brethren, I sometimes feel so much of the same love working in my soul, that I verily believe, a man, thoroughly acted by a spirit of goodness, would be ever content to live in a banishment from God, I mean from the sweet illapses and touches of his love, so that he might be without sin, rather than any of God's creation should be ever unacquainted with him: and therefore, he thinks it would be the best employment and greatest happiness, in the world, to be used as an instrument to such an <HI>universal good.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="017489_0008_0FA123A2707CB070"/>And whilst I sometimes entertain myself with such thoughts as these, I feel a secret joy springing in my soul, and whispering to me, if there be so much love in a <HI>drop,</HI> in a <HI>beam</HI> in a <HI>creature,</HI> there must sure be infinitely more in the <HI>ocean,</HI> in the <HI>sun,</HI> in <HI>God</HI> himself. I find all these good desires and cares in myself swal∣lowed up by the discovery of an object, which is all goodness and omnipotence, an infinitely wise and al∣mighty goodness; and a ravishing sight of all things already lying in his tender arms, and sacred embraces; who, in his sovereign and incomprehensible wisdom, hath still been conducting them through all their va∣rious intricacies, for a greater good and glory."</P>
<P>Having ended his introduction, which breathes a spirit of piety and benevolence, our author proceeds to confirm the doctrine of an <HI>Universal Restoration of the human race,</HI> by a variety of testimonies, from scripture. I shall not quote every thing he advances under each head, as that would swell this work to too large a size: But, in as few words as possible, I shall endeavour to give you his ideas.</P>
<P>The first text he produces is from the 1st Epistle of Timothy ii. 3.—<HI>God our saviour, who will have all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth.</HI> Upon which he observes—"The letter of this text is full and express; God will have ALL MEN to be saved, and should we press it, there are almost as many argu∣ments as words. For 1st, It is not said God <HI>would</HI> have all to be saved by his <HI>good will,</HI> but that he <HI>authoritatively wills it: wills</HI> it as a being of supreme, uncontroulable power, a being that <HI>will</HI> be obeyed in spite of the corrupt dispositions of men, or the
<PB N="5" REF="017489_0009_0FA123A330199170"/>
mischievous arts of devils. It is a <HI>fixed, determined, immutable</HI> will, no <HI>transient,</HI> nor revocable. Thus <HI>power∣fully</HI> and <HI>irresistibly</HI> does God <HI>will all men to be saved.</HI></P>
<P>And as he <HI>wills</HI> the end, so does he <HI>will</HI> the <HI>ne∣cessary means</HI> leading to it. In order to their being <HI>saved,</HI> he will have <HI>all men come to the knowledge of the truth.</HI> No man <HI>is</HI> or can be sanctified or saved without the knowledge of the truth; God wills this therefore, that they be saved, and that this means of salvation shall pass upon them.</P>
<P>Further—this will has its ground in the essential benevolence of God's nature, The salvation of all men is good and acceptable in his sight. The words <HI>God our saviour</HI> are not to be restrained to the <HI>Elect,</HI> for that would not carry forth a will to save all men; this, therefore, is to be taken in the same latitude and extent with other places, where he is called <HI>the saviour of all men,</HI> Ch. iv. 10. And <HI>God that quickneth all things.</HI> Ch. vi. 13. And our saviour tells us, <HI>all things live to God.</HI> Luke xx. 38. And he is called <HI>the God of the spirits of all flesh.</HI> Numb. xvi. 22. And mark you, who is this saviour? It is <HI>God,</HI> not <HI>Christ,</HI> for of him he speaks distinctly afterwards. But <HI>God</HI> the <HI>father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this principle therefore, that <HI>God wills the salva∣tion of men,</HI> he hath commanded us to pray for the whole world of mankind. He hath assured us, this is peculiarly <HI>good and acceptable in his sight,</HI> And with the highest reason, for it perfectly falls in with his gracious design, and tends to bring it into effect. Neither does this overset the doctrine of <HI>Election,</HI> as we shall shew in the sequel of this discourse. For tho' <HI>many are called few are chosen to happiness in the</HI> NEXT <HI>state.</HI> When there∣fore, we are required to <HI>pray for all men,</HI> even for their
<PB N="6" REF="017489_0010_0FA123A3EEEE38A0"/>
<HI>salvation,</HI> it is not meant to throw down the distinction between the <HI>Elect</HI> and <HI>Reprobate.</HI> It is not meant to reverse and alter God's decrees, whereby he hath given some the <HI>preheminence</HI> and <HI>double portion</HI> above others, but it is a seeking that <HI>salvation</HI> for <HI>all,</HI> which God hath prepared for them in <HI>his own time and way.</HI></P>
<P>It is the <HI>will</HI> of God then, that <HI>all men should be saved.</HI> But remember, this <HI>will</HI> of his does not rest in pitying men and wishing it were better with them. No, the <HI>will</HI> of God and his <HI>work</HI> are one. He <HI>wills</HI> nothing but he <HI>works</HI> it. Being an <HI>omnipotent</HI> and <HI>wise</HI> agent, he can never be resisted. But in as much as he <HI>wills</HI> the salvation of <HI>all men,</HI> he will finally bring it about; so that the wickedness of the human heart shall be tempered and subdued, the curse and wrath be done away, and a most delightful and blissful harmony take place."</P>
<P>This reasoning our author further illustrates, by the following words.—<HI>For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</HI> 5th and 6th verses.</P>
<P N="1">"1st. <HI>There is one God,</HI> or more properly—<HI>God is one.</HI> That is, <HI>all men reprobate</HI> as well as <HI>elect,</HI> have <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>self same God.</HI> The <HI>Elect</HI> have not <HI>one</HI> God and <HI>Reprobate another;</HI> but <HI>one God</HI> is the God of them <HI>both.</HI> To adopt the words in Malachy ii. 10. <HI>Have we not all one father? Hath not one God created us? Yea, the same good and kind and merciful God and father made all.</HI> So then we see the blessed God stands in same near and tender relation to the whole human race.</P>
<P>Again— 2dly, The <HI>mediator is also one. One mediator,</HI> says the apostle, <HI>between God and man.</HI> Here again, all men are recapitulated and headed in one, who is the
<PB N="7" REF="017489_0011_0FA123A4B594A8D8"/>
mediator of reconciliation, and of all communion of good from God to man, in whom, as such, all men have joint and equal interest. He is not styled a <HI>Mediator</HI> between <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>Elect,</HI> but between <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> that is, <HI>All Men,</HI> All that come under the denomi∣nation of men, as they have an interest in the great God as their common father, so have they in his son Jesus Christ as their common mediator. Under this character, he is not nearer to one part of the human race than another. So that <HI>all men</HI> are under an equally gracious counsel and design of salvation.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, This mediator <HI>gave himself a ransom for all.</HI> These words can signify no less than <HI>general redemption. God wills that all men should be saved,</HI> and therefore, he has given <HI>his son a ransom for all.</HI> Here a price is paid down, such as justice required, and God was pleased to accept. And this <HI>universal ransom</HI> is what the <HI>mystical Jews</HI> can no more bear now, than the <HI>literal Jews</HI> could hear of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> being taken into the covenant of Abraham. One would imagine the apostle foresaw what a grudging spirit would prevail in the world. But the scriptures of the New Testament speak yet more fully as touching this point. See Titus ii. 11. <HI>The grace of God, which bringeth salvation to all men, hath appeared,</HI> &amp;c. i Tim. iv. 10. Rom. v. 18. 1 John ii. 2. <HI>If any man sin we have an advocate with the father, Jesus Christ the righteous, who is the pro∣pitiation for</HI> OUR <HI>sins, and not for ours only, but for the sins of the</HI> WHOLE WORLD. A text so worded, with a <HI>Not Only,</HI> and the <HI>Whole World,</HI> looks as if the spirit had purposely consulted to obviate and prevent all clippings of it.</P>
<P>But to come to the argument: From hence it will be said, what tho' <HI>Christ gives himself a ransom for all,</HI> we see yet all men, nay the <HI>greatest part</HI> of men, have
<PB N="8" REF="017489_0012_0FA123A5701A58A8"/>
no benefit by it, but live and die unreconciled to God. It is granted; but because this redemption, this ransom does not operate now, have we authority to say it never shall? The blood of Christ never loses its virtue. Tho' the happy effects of his undertaking may not yet appear, yet the time will come when they shall be universally felt, and most illustriously displayed. For which reason the apostle adds—<HI>to be testified in due time.</HI> The mean∣ing of St. Paul is—that there shall be a time, when it will be manifest that <HI>all men</HI> are ransomed and bought by the blood of Christ. God will not deny his son the price of his blood. But before he gives up the kingdom, he shall see of the travail of his soul and be satisfied. The reconciliation shall finally operate upon all, and if the <HI>Elect</HI> are first received to favour, the rest shall follow after in their proper order."</P>
<P>Another text produced by our author is in 1 Tim. iv. 10. <HI>The living God, who is the saviour of all men, especially of those that believe.</HI>" Nothing could be more to our purpose than these words. They imply that God is the common saviour of the whole human race, and yet that he is <HI>particularly</HI> so of them that believe the gospel of his son. But the question here is, what this <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> imports, <HI>chiefly</HI> of them that believe, where∣in it is, that some, even of those that believe, have the advantage of the rest of men: Before we look further let us take what this place affords. And the special ad∣vantage of <HI>believers</HI> above other men is, that they are saved from the wrath to come, saved in the next state, and immediately upon the coming of Christ, are admitted to the heavenly happiness. Others must stay for this; being unqualified for such felicity, they must wait till they are bro't to a better temper of mind. Yet this does not prove that God is not <HI>their</HI> saviour; because he con∣demns
<PB N="9" REF="017489_0013_0FA123A7585E72F8"/>
them to suffering, he has not cast them off. If you will turn to 1 Cor. xv. 22. &amp;c. and, you will see this matter fully cleared up. <HI>As in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive, but every one in his own order, Christ the first fruits, afterwards they that are Christ's at his coming: And when he shall have put down all rule, authority and power, cometh the end.</HI> The argu∣ment arising from hence is, that believers will be raised to everlasting life at Christ's second coming; that unbe∣lievers will be raised too, but only in order to punish them in <HI>hell;</HI> and that when their punishment shall have produced a proper effect, they will be recovered to the same happiness with the saints. This being ac∣complished, Christ having completed his undertaking will give up the kingdom to the Father.</P>
<P>From what has been said it appears that this term <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> is not quiescent, idle, or insignificant, but im∣porting a great difference between believers and others; yet not excluding the rest altogether, or forever, from salvation; nay it strongly implies the contrary, it implies that <HI>all</HI> are or must be saved in one degree or another, and at some time or another."</P>
<P>The ingenious Mr. <HI>White</HI> pursues his subject, by re∣ferring us next to Romans v. from the 15th to the 19th verse. <HI>But not as the offence, so also is the free gift: for if through the offence of one, many be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. For if by one man's offence death reigned by one, much more they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righ∣teousness, shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ. There∣fore,
<PB N="10" REF="017489_0014_0FA123A7B08E8EA8"/>
as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one, the free gift came upon all men, unto justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</HI></P>
<P>"In these words, the gracious designs of God are laid open at large. <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> are opposed to each other; the one as the source of <HI>sin</HI> and <HI>death,</HI> the other of <HI>life</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> to the human race. Between these two, there is a parallel drawn by the apostle, shewing wherein they agree, and wherein they differ. They agree in this, that they each, by turns, represented mankind, and greatly affected those they represented, by their conduct. And in this they ma∣terially differ, that one will be the occasion of much more <HI>good</HI> than the other was of <HI>hurt</HI> to the human species. For thus we read, ver. 15. <HI>But not as the offence, so also is the free gift, for if through the offence of one many be dead,</HI> MUCH MORE <HI>the grace of God, and the gift by grace, hath abounded unto many.</HI> I can∣not conceive other meaning of these words than this. <HI>That there is much more in the heart of God to make men righteous by the second Adam, without their own personal merit, than to make men sinners by the first Adam, without their personal demerit:</HI> Here you see, <HI>grace</HI> has the <HI>preference,</HI> in the plot, God hath a de∣sign to shew his wrath, and to make his power known, but more to glorify his <HI>grace.</HI></P>
<P>The second difference is in the comparison instituted between the one sin of Adam, charged upon all <HI>his</HI> seed, and the abundance of Christ's righteousness imputed to <HI>his</HI> seed. It was but one slip, one transgression, and that was the eating forbidden fruit, that men smart for to this day; but Christ performed <HI>many acts of righ∣teousness,</HI> he was all righteous, and therefore our many
<PB N="11" REF="017489_0015_0FA123A871886798"/>
offences are forgiven, and they who "receive abun∣dance of grace; and the gift of righteousness, shall reign in life by one man Jesus Christ." ver. 16, 17. yea, ver. 18. The apostle extends the respect and relation of this to <HI>all men</HI>; therefore, says he, <HI>as by the offence of one judgment came upon all to condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men to justification of life.</HI> This is directly to my general argument. There is one offence upon <HI>all men</HI> to condemnation, and the righteousness of one upon <HI>all men</HI> to justification. Tho' it is true, none but those who <HI>now</HI> lay hold on it, have the <HI>immediate benefit</HI> of it yet, it was a price paid for <HI>all,</HI> and that many other scriptures do attest. And therefore the <HI>many,</HI> in the next verse, is not a bounding or limitation of the scope and intention of Christ's death, but it is equivalent to the <HI>all</HI> before, else it should be less than the severity, for <HI>all died in Adam</HI>▪ and therefore, <HI>in Christ shall all be made alive.</HI> For as the grace and righteousness of the <HI>second Adam</HI> are much more than the sin of the <HI>first,</HI> so the extent of them, with respect to the subject that reaps the benefit, cannot be supposed to be <HI>less.</HI> We conclude therefore, with the apostle that <HI>as sin hath reigned universally unto death, so grace shall reign through righteousness as universally, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Grace</HI> will triumph at last. Though Christ has not yet reigned so powerfully, as to bring into effect all these glorious advantages of his death, yet he will do it before the end; for he <HI>must reign till he has put all enemies under his feet.</HI> And will not that <HI>end,</HI> when he shall deliver up the kingdom to God▪ even his father, when he shall have destroyed <HI>all the works of the Devil,</HI> when he shall have exhibited acts of the greatest and most <HI>universal</HI> grace, be viewed with admiration by the whole intelligent creation, and celebrated with the loudest anthems of praise!"</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="017489_0016_0FA123A930311110"/>The last quotation I shall make from <HI>Mr. White</HI> is has remarks upon Eph. i. 10. and Col. i. 20. <HI>That in the dispensation of the fulness of times, he might gather together in one, all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</HI> This is the <HI>mystery</HI> of his will made known to us by the gospel, according to <HI>his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself.</HI> To this join Col. i. 20. <HI>And having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself, by him. I say, whether they be things on earth, or things in heaven.</HI> "The words rendered here to <HI>gather together in one,</HI> signify in the original, to <HI>rally</HI> or <HI>rehead</HI> routed or scattered forces or members, to reduce them to the place or rank where they were before. And the word which is rendered to <HI>reconcile</HI> signifies to <HI>change</HI> a thing from a state of enmity to har∣mony; to make it <HI>another thing</HI> from what it was. It has the same force with the other word, tho' from a dif∣ferent metaphor. They both import, that <HI>all men,</HI> all things were originally made by <HI>Christ,</HI> stood in him, were headed under him, comported dutifully with their rela∣tion to him. There was no war, no fighting, no dis∣order. These all came in by sin: therefore be saith, <HI>Christ made peace by the blood of his cross.</HI> By the fall, all things had fallen asunder, became disjointed, knew not their proper place or subordination. Confusion dwelt upon the face both of the natural and moral world. Every thing was disordered, and as it were, in a state of war. <HI>Elect</HI> as well as <HI>Reprobate,</HI> things in <HI>heaven,</HI> as well as things on <HI>earth,</HI> were in a miserable shattered condition. But God, who is rich in mercy, sent his Son to recover them out of this state. And he has laid an effectual plan for it. He has struck at the <HI>root of the mischief.</HI> By taking upon him our sins, and expiating them on the tree, he has reconciled the world unto God,
<PB N="13" REF="017489_0017_0FA123A9F0631D90"/>
slain the enmity between them, and made provision for an <HI>Universal restoration to favour.</HI> The subject-matter upon which God means to act is evidently <HI>universal.</HI> This is expressed by the <HI>comprehensive</HI> term ALL THINGS. And when he says <HI>all things,</HI> it is manifest <HI>nothing is excepted.</HI> There is nothing either in heaven or earth which shall not finally be reconciled to God, and be reduced to a proper state of subjection.</P>
<P>And is there not power in the life and reign of Christ to do it? Is he not fully able to bring <HI>all things</HI> back to himself, as their proper head, and to continue them so? Surely he is. And when he has once recovered them to himself, it will appear that none are able to tear them from him. What the Father has designed, he will execute, and, in conse∣quence of their joint operation, <HI>all things</HI> will be ex∣tricated from their present confusion, restored to har∣mony and favour, and continue so throughout the endless ages of eternity!</P>
<P>This recapitulation of <HI>all things</HI> under Christ, and <HI>universal restoration</HI> to favour, were the <HI>mystery</HI> which was hid from the beginning of the world till the time of the gospel. God did not declare it openly till the coming of his son. He gave secret intimations of it in former dispensations. But a complete discovery of his merciful intentions to the whole race of Adam was reserved for the gospel. And the time will come, when the <HI>mystery</HI> of life and salvation shall be manifested upon <HI>all men,</HI> when <HI>all men</HI> shall know the fellowship of it. Yet a little while, and these vicissitudes and interchangeable courses of good and evil shall go out, and give place to <HI>everlasting love, healing and peace.</HI>" —Thus much for the excellent <HI>Jeremiah White.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="017489_0018_0FA123AAB3F1B2F0"/>Another portion of scripture, as mentioned by ano∣ther writer upon the same subject, may be found in 1 Cor. xv. 24th to 28th ver. <HI>Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the father, when he shall have put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. And when all things shall be sub∣dued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</HI> Upon which our writer observes,—</P>
<P>"Though the apostle turns our view, in this para∣graph, to the END of the <HI>mediatory scheme,</HI> the time when <HI>Christ shall have delivered the kingdom up to the Father,</HI> he has yet very evidently taken care to do it in such a manner, as to guard us against thinking, that this scheme will be finished, will come to its intended period, upon the <HI>second advent of Christ,</HI> by his then <HI>finally and un∣alterably</HI> fixing the states of men, whether good or bad. The apostle, I say, as though he had it in express view, has taken all reasonable care to guard against this mis∣construction of his meaning, by giving us very clearly and fully to understand, that there would be a <HI>great deal to be done, after the second coming of Christ,</HI> for the accomplishment of which, a <HI>long period of time</HI> would be requisite, before the plan of God would be compleated, and the whole accomplished, which he had trusted to his Son to bring into effect. For 'tis here most peremp∣torily affirmed, that <HI>universal subjection to Christ</HI> should
<PB N="15" REF="017489_0019_0FA123AB751A8F08"/>
yet be effected; and the affirmation is expressed in a variety of as strong and extensive terms as could have been used: <HI>as by putting down all rule, and all autho∣rity, and all power; by putting all enemies under his feet; by putting all things under his feet; by all things being subject unto him. All enemies</HI> then, yea, <HI>all things</HI> must be subject unto <HI>Christ,</HI> before <HI>he delivers up the mediatory kingdom to his Father.</HI> This will not be accomplished at his <HI>second coming.</HI> For however true it is that the <HI>first death</HI> will then be destroyed by him, it is not the truth that all enemies will be subjected to him; for SIN, the very enemy he came into the world to destroy still reigns and triumphs, and <HI>will</HI> do so, in regard to multi∣tudes. Nor will the <HI>second death</HI> be ever destroyed, tho' the greatest enemy of man, if Christ, at his second coming to judge the world, puts off his character as its saviour.</P>
<P>It need not now be said, what a poor, low idea the <HI>common explanation</HI> of this scripture passage gives us of the <HI>final effect</HI> of Christ's reign in his mediatorial king∣dom, in comparison with that contended for in the above interpretation. According to this, <HI>Sin, Satan,</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> the <HI>second</HI> as well as the <HI>first</HI> death, will be totally and absolutely destroyed; and the <HI>whole human race</HI> reduced under a <HI>free,</HI> and yet <HI>full</HI> subjection to the government of God, so as to be the <HI>meet objects of his mercy,</HI> when he shall <HI>finally</HI> take <HI>the kingdom into his own hands.</HI> Whereas, according to the other, <HI>myriads</HI> of the sons of Adam will be <HI>everlasting confined</HI> in hell, as REBELS against the government of God, that is the moral enemies of his kingdom, notwithstanding it is here most peremptorily affirmed, that <HI>all enemies shall be subdued;</HI> that <HI>all things shall be put under the
<PB N="16" REF="017489_0020_0FA123AC301284C0"/>
feet of Christ;</HI> and that he shall <HI>not deliver up the king∣dom to the Father,</HI> 'till <HI>all this is actually accomplished.</HI>"</P>
<P>Another text produced by the same writer, is the <HI>very first</HI> that reveals the promise of a saviour, and <HI>sum∣marily</HI> comprehends the <HI>whole</HI> of what has been said concerning the <HI>reduction of mankind universally</HI> to an <HI>obedient subjection</HI> to the governing will of God. The text is that Genesis iii. 15.—<HI>And I will put enmity be∣tween thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed: it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</HI> Expositors seem universally agreed, that <HI>Christ,</HI> who was <HI>born of a woman,</HI> is the <HI>seed</HI> here intended. And when 'tis affirmed of him, that <HI>he shall bruise the serpent's head,</HI> the <HI>thought</HI> designed to be conveyed is the <HI>complete victory</HI> he should gain over the <HI>Devil,</HI> here spoken of under the emblem of a serpent. For the words are evidently an allusion to the way of <HI>destroying</HI> serpents, by striking at their head. To <HI>bruise a serpent's head</HI> is a phrase expressive of <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same</HI> thing with <HI>killing a serpent.</HI> Consequently, when it is said of Christ, that he should <HI>bruise the serpent's head,</HI> the idea obviously and naturally communicated by the words, is that he <HI>shall destroy the Devil,</HI> not his <HI>being,</HI> but that <HI>kingdom of his,</HI> which as a <HI>tempter,</HI> he had introduced into the world, accompanied with <HI>sorrow</HI> and <HI>death.</HI> I see not, but this <HI>first promise</HI> of God fairly leads us to look for the time, when <HI>sin, that work of the Devil,</HI> shall be totally and absolutely destroyed, by him who was <HI>born of a woman.</HI> This is certainly the most simple and plain construction that can be put upon the words, if they refer to Christ, and his <HI>conquest of the Devil,</HI> that is, of the <HI>kingdom of sin,</HI> he has been an instrument of introducing into the world. So that the whole of what
<PB N="17" REF="017489_0021_0FA123AE71D850A0"/>
has been offered is nothing more than an enlargement upon that, which was <HI>summarily,</HI> and in a few strongly expressive words, delivered as the <HI>grand intention</HI> of God, in constituting his son Jesus the saviour of men. And I must freely acknowledge, if the time does not come before Christ's delivery of the kingdom to the Father, when it shall be true in <HI>event</HI> and <HI>fact,</HI> that SIN is totally <HI>destroyed,</HI> by a reduction of <HI>all men</HI> under <HI>moral subjection</HI> to God, that it ought to be fairly and ho∣nestly owned, that he has not <HI>bruised the serpent's head,</HI> as it is declared that he should. How can it be, that the <HI>Devil,</HI> that is, his <HI>kingdom,</HI> which <HI>essentially</HI> consists in the reign of <HI>sin</HI> and <HI>lust,</HI> is destroyed by Christ, while thousands and millions of the human race, not only in the present state, but throughout all eternity (as is the commonly received opinion) will live in <HI>en∣mity with God,</HI> retaining their character as <HI>rebels</HI> against <HI>him,</HI> but <HI>subjects of the Devil's kingdom?</HI> How this should be appears to me impossible!"</P>
<P>Another text from this same writer, and the last I shall bring to view, is recorded Revelation v. 13. <HI>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, blessing and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>These words, our author observes,—"evidently look forward to the <HI>completion</HI> of the scheme of God with reference to mankind, or to the time of God's being <HI>all in all.</HI> The <HI>sinless intelligences above</HI> are brought in as uniting with the <HI>whole race of Adam,</HI> in ascribing the glory of their <HI>restitution,</HI> or <HI>redemption,</HI> to <HI>God,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="017489_0022_0FA123AF340D3200"/>
who contrived the plan of it, and to <HI>Christ,</HI> who was the person, under God, that carried it into execution. And that mankind, <HI>universally,</HI> are the persons singing this hymn of praise, in concert with the holy angels of heaven, is evident, as I imagine, beyond all reason∣able dispute, from the <HI>enumeration</HI> here made, which is in the fullest and most extensive terms. For, not only the creatures which are in heaven, but those also which are <HI>on earth,</HI> and <HI>under the earth,</HI> and <HI>in the sea,</HI> are the creatures the apostle John saw bowing down in <HI>voluntary</HI> acts of homage, and <HI>thankful adorations,</HI> before <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> for the great benefit of <HI>redemption,</HI> or <HI>salvation.</HI> And, as though sufficiently extensive language had not been used, in the above enumeration, 'tis further added, <HI>and all that are in them.</HI> If the apostle, or rather the Spirit of God, who spake by him, had really intended to have introduced the <HI>whole human kind,</HI> together with the angels, as ascribing thanksgiving and blessing to <HI>God</HI> and the <HI>lamb,</HI> for their <HI>restoration, reduction,</HI> or <HI>salvation,</HI> how could he have done in words that more easily and cer∣tainly convey this sense? For the <HI>whole human kind</HI> are to be found in the places here specified; and the specification of these places which contain them <HI>all</HI> is a sure argument that he intended to comprehend them <HI>all.</HI> Why else should he be thus particular in specify∣ing them? In short, the <HI>creatures</HI> the apostle John saw paying their thankful acknowledgments, together with the angels, for the salvation by Jesus Christ, were the <HI>whole posterity of Adam, mankind,</HI> without ex∣ception. For he here uses language which comprehends all that <HI>live on the earth, all that ever died on it, and were buried under it; all that ever died on the sea and
<PB N="19" REF="017489_0023_0FA123AFF1534608"/>
were thrown into it.</HI> And if <HI>every creature that lives on the earth, and every creature that is in the state of the dead</HI> does not comprehend <HI>mankind universally,</HI> 'tis difficult to find words that can do it."</P>
<P>Having extracted from a number of writers, some <HI>few,</HI> of the many texts they have mentioned in favour of <HI>Salvation for all men,</HI> I shall now exhibit <HI>a like extract</HI> from what they and others have offered in answer to the objections brought against the truth of this doctrine.</P>
<P>It is objected, that the punishment of wicked men in the other world, is frequently declared in scripture to be <HI>eternal, everlasting, for ever and ever;</HI> the consequence of which is, that 'tis impossible they should be saved.</P>
<P>Mr. Joseph Nicol Scott, in answer to this objection, says—"for my own part, I must frankly confess, that after having, with repeated care, examined <HI>all</HI> the pas∣sages of scripture, that relate to the <HI>future punishment,</HI> I have not been able to find <HI>one single text,</HI> in which this article of <HI>an eternal and endless misery</HI> is either <HI>ex∣pressly affirmed,</HI> or <HI>necessarily implied.</HI> And as to the term so commonly translated <HI>eternal, everlasting, for ever and ever,</HI> it does not from any force of the word, imply what we mean by a <HI>strict and proper eternity.</HI> The original words, both in the Hebrew and Greek, signify nothing more than an <HI>age,</HI> and in the plural <HI>ages,</HI> either <HI>longer</HI> or <HI>shorter, definite</HI> or <HI>indefinite.</HI>" Says another writer upon this subject, "there are hundreds of texts, in the old and new testament, in which this word, translated eternal and forever, cannot possibly mean more than a <HI>definite</HI> or <HI>indefinite duration,</HI> which may not be <HI>eternal.</HI> Gen. ix. 12. <HI>This</HI> (the rain-bow) <HI>is the token of the covenant
<PB N="20" REF="017489_0024_0FA123B0B0228A50"/>
between me and you, for</HI> PERPETUAL GENERATIONS. In the original it is, if translated as the word is elsewhere, —for <HI>eternal generations.</HI> Gen. xiii. 15. <HI>All the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed</HI> FOR EVER. Gen. xvii. 8. <HI>I will give unto thee</HI> and to thy seed, all the land of Canaan for an EVERLASTING POSSESSION. In the 13th ver. <HI>He that is born in thy house, must needs be circumcised, and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an</HI> EVERLASTING COVENANT. Exod. xii. 24. <HI>And ye shall observe this thing</HI> (the passover) <HI>for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons</HI> FOREVER. But there is no end of citing <HI>ordinances, statutes</HI> or <HI>grants,</HI> which were to be <HI>eternal, everlasting</HI> and <HI>forever</HI> in our modern way of interpreting the <HI>original</HI> scripture words, which yet were to last no longer, at the utmost, than the Mosaic Oeconomy, and have ceased more than 1600 Years ago."</P>
<P>"And the same use of these words is retained in the New-Testament, as may be seen by the following texts. Matth. xxviii. 20. <HI>Lo I am with you even to the end of the world:</HI> So the English translation is, because the translators found it necessary. But had they translated the Greek word here, as in other places, it must have been to the <HI>end of eternity.</HI> The evangelist Luke speaks of <HI>holy prophets which have been since the world began.</HI> But had the original been rendered, as in other places, it must have been <HI>from eternity.</HI> I shall take up no more time and room in citing texts to the purpose we are upon. The reader may, if he pleases, look into the <HI>Greek Con∣cordance,</HI> and he will there find, a greater number than he can well imagine." I shall only say further here, from Dr. <HI>Hartley,</HI> that "it does not appear from the writings of the most ancient fathers, that they construed the texts that speak of the future punishment in the
<PB N="21" REF="017489_0025_0FA123B174DA9BF0"/>
<HI>never-ending</HI> sense. And the omission of this sense, in the <HI>ancient creeds,</HI> shews that it was no <HI>original doctrine.</HI> And indeed the doctrine of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> as now taught by the papists, seems to be a corruption of a genuine doc∣trine held by the ancient fathers, concerning that <HI>fire of hell</HI> which will <HI>burn out Sin and Lust.</HI>" He adds, "it may be, that the <HI>absolute eternity</HI> of punishment was not received, till after the introduction of metaphysical disputes concerning time, eternity, and the ways of ex∣pressing these; that is, not till after the <HI>pagan philosophy</HI> and <HI>vain deceit</HI> had mixed themselves with, and cor∣rupted Christianity."</P>
<P>"Another text applicable to our purpose, is Gal. i. 4. <HI>That he might deliver us from this present evil world.</HI> Had the original been rendered as in other places, it would have been—<HI>from this present evil eternity,</HI> which is palpable nonsense. The same may be said of Luke xvi. 8. <HI>The children of this world are wiser,</HI> &amp;c. In the Greek it is, <HI>the children of this Eternity,</HI> which the translators knew would be an improper and absurd ren∣dering of the <HI>Original Word.</HI>"</P>
<P>"It is objected, that the word <HI>eternal,</HI> the <HI>very word</HI> which is connected with the <HI>punishment</HI> of wicked men, is applied to <HI>God,</HI> representing <HI>his strict proper eternity;</HI> for which reason we may conclude, that the <HI>misery</HI> of sinners, in the other world, will be <HI>endless,</HI> and therefore, inconsistent with their being finally saved."</P>
<P>In answer to this objection, a great number of writers upon the subject, unite in saying,—"that the <HI>eternity</HI> of God cannot be argued from the mere force of the word rendered <HI>eternal.</HI> As it signifies duration either <HI>definite</HI> or <HI>indefinite,</HI> it may be applied as well to that which has <HI>no end,</HI> as to that which is of a determinate continuance.
<PB N="22" REF="017489_0026_0FA123B234E96130"/>
But then, it is the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>subject,</HI> and not the <HI>mere force</HI> of the word that must ascertain its meaning. And did we not know, before hand, that <HI>eternity</HI> was an essential attribute of God, it could never be argued from the application of this word to him."</P>
<P>"It is again objected, that the <HI>happiness</HI> of good men, and the <HI>misery</HI> of the wicked, are both connected with the <HI>same word,</HI> and in the <HI>same sentence.</HI> And hence, if <HI>one</HI> is <HI>endless,</HI> so must the <HI>other</HI> be also."</P>
<P>The answer is, that "the <HI>bare force</HI> of the word will not support us, in maintaining an <HI>endless duration</HI> with respect, either to the <HI>happiness</HI> of the <HI>righteous</HI> shall be <HI>happy forever.</HI> And why! because they are said, in other texts of scripture, to be <HI>incorruptible, indissoluble, immortal,</HI> not to <HI>die any more,</HI> and the like. But these terms are no where, in the inspired pages, applied to the <HI>wicked.</HI> On the contrary they are said to <HI>die the second death,</HI> which means their suffering the <HI>future torments,</HI> which they may do, and yet be finally saved, as has been proved."</P>
<P>"Another objection, and, in the opinion of some, the <HI>strongest</HI> that can be urged, is taken from those words of our Saviour in Mark ixth, thrice solemnly repeated,—WHERE THEIR WORM DIETH NOT, AND THE FIRE IS NOT QUENCHED; which words, it is thought, are irreconcilable with the doctrine of <HI>Salvation for all men.</HI>"</P>
<P>In answer hereto, it is said by one and another of the before mentioned writers, that "this declaration of our Saviour can prove, in strict argument, no more than that the <HI>torments of the wicked shall last as long as
<PB N="23" REF="017489_0027_0FA123B2F3F8F268"/>
their next state of existence lasts,</HI> without determining <HI>how long</HI> that shall be. If their worm preys upon them, without ceasing, <HI>as long as they are in hell,</HI> it is to them, strictly and rigidly speaking, a <HI>worm that does not die.</HI> So if the fire torments them <HI>as long as they exist in the next state,</HI> it is to them <HI>a fire which is not quenched,</HI> though their existence in that state may not be <HI>abso∣lutely eternal.</HI>"</P>
<P>"But the most plain, easy and satisfactory answer is—that these words are taken from the book of <HI>Isaiah's prophecy,</HI> and allude to the punishment of those, whose bodies were either buried in the valley of Hinnom, or permitted to lie on the ground in the form of <HI>dead car∣eases,</HI> to be fed upon by worms, that delight in putrefac∣tion. And consequently, as the <HI>fire</HI> which <HI>burned</HI> these bodies, and the worms that fed on them, can in no sense be said <HI>not to be quenched,</HI> and <HI>not to die,</HI> than this, that they continued till these <HI>carcases were consumed;</HI> so may it be said of the <HI>worm</HI> that preys on the wicked in <HI>hell,</HI> and of the <HI>fire</HI> that <HI>torments</HI> them, that the <HI>one dieth not,</HI> and the <HI>other is not quenched,</HI> till they have certainly effected the <HI>dissolution,</HI> or <HI>death</HI> of wicked men, in the future state. If any desire to see a more full and large account of this text, they may find it in Mr. Joseph Nicol Scott's discourse upon the <HI>future torments,</HI> in the 2d Vol. of his Sermons."</P>
<P>"It is objected yet further, that it will greatly tend to encourage wicked men, in their vicious courses, to be told that the <HI>future torments</HI> will have an <HI>end,</HI> which must be the case, if <HI>All are finally saved.</HI>"</P>
<P>To this it is answered, that "<HI>moral depravity</HI> is abso∣lutely inconsistent with <HI>rational happiness:</HI> and that the
<PB N="24" REF="017489_0028_0FA123B3B88E5CF0"/>
<HI>suffering</HI> of wicked men, in the next state, will be <HI>exceed∣ingly great</HI> in <HI>degree,</HI> as well as <HI>long</HI> in <HI>duration,</HI> in order that they may be made the <HI>willing people of God.</HI> Nor will they be delivered from their <HI>suffering,</HI> till this is effected. And will it not argue folly, as great as can be imagined, for any rather than not <HI>proceed in their vicious courses,</HI> to chuse to expose themselves to pain, <HI>unutter∣able pain, for a long duration</HI> (God only knows how long) when they might, only by approving themselves faithful subjects to Jesus Christ, pass, without suffering this pain, into the joys of the <HI>resurrection state?</HI> And this folly will deserve the name of <HI>downright madness,</HI> if it be remembered, they must cease from <HI>being wicked,</HI> before they can possibly be instated in <HI>final happiness.</HI> There is no room for debate here. Persons must act in contradiction to all wisdom, in defiance of common sense, who will venture, for the short lived pleasures of sin, to expose themselves to that <HI>fire</HI> of <HI>hell</HI> which will effect their <HI>death a second time,</HI> under all the circumstances of <HI>lingering horror</HI> and <HI>tormenting agony:</HI> especially if it be considered they may avoid all this by renouncing their sins, and be admitted to <HI>immortal life and happiness at the resurrection morn.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, it may be worthy of consideration, whether the <HI>common doctrine</HI> is so likely to restrain men from sin, as <HI>that,</HI> which has been explained and defended, in the foregoing pages. 'Tis undeniably certain, notwith∣standing all that has been said to make men believe the <HI>torments of hell will have no end,</HI> that they generally <HI>walk in the way of their own heart,</HI> and will not be kept under due restraint. And perhaps, upon examination, it will be found, that one principal reason of this is, that the <HI>terrrors</HI> proposed for their persuasion, <HI>exceed their belief.</HI>
<PB REF="017489_0029_0FA123B475E973E0"/>
The conceptions they <HI>naturally</HI> form of the ALL MERCIFUL BEING are a counter-balance to their fear of <HI>never-ending misery.</HI> Whereas, in the other scheme, there is nothing <HI>incredible,</HI> in the torments of another world. They are perfectly analogous to what is experienced in the <HI>present state.</HI> And there is no more reason to object against them, than the <HI>present judicial proceedings</HI> of heaven against wicked <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. They are <HI>equally</HI> consistent with mens natural notions of the <HI>benevolence of God.</HI> And consequently. As pro∣posed in the above scheme, their influence would not be <HI>obstructed</HI> by their <HI>incredibility:</HI> But they would strike the mind with <HI>full force,</HI> and operate to a much better purpose, restraining men more <HI>effectually</HI> from their <HI>wicked courses.</HI>"</P>
<P><HI>Finally</HI>—It is said, "upon supposition of the <HI>truth</HI> of <HI>Universal Salvation,</HI> it may yet be <HI>improper</HI> and <HI>hurtful</HI> to open it, as a scripture doctrine to the world." To which I have seen the proper answer, in these words.</P>
<P>"It would be very <HI>extraordinary,</HI> if setting a <HI>scrip∣ture truth</HI> in its genuine light should have a dangerous tendency. To suppose such a thing would reflect dishonour upon the <HI>revelation</HI> of God. If <HI>final, uni∣versal happiness</HI> is a <HI>doctrine of the gospel,</HI> we need not fear its injuring mankind, if they were brought <HI>sin∣cerely</HI> and <HI>universally</HI> to believe it. And indeed, all fear of this kind is founded <HI>ultimately</HI> on <HI>man's wisdom,</HI> in opposition to the <HI>wisdom of God,</HI> which stands in need of no <HI>human art</HI> or <HI>contrivance,</HI> but can, without it, guard mankind against wickedness, and make them good and faithful subjects, in the kingdom of righteousness."</P>

For if we are brought into being <HI>expectants</HI> of a <HI>blessed immortality,</HI> and upon a foundation that will not disappoint us, why then should we find fault with that <HI>discipline,</HI> however <HI>severe,</HI> which may, in true reason, be <HI>morally</HI> connected with <HI>the actual enjoy∣ment of it</HI>? We are, upon this plan of things, <HI>infinitely obliged</HI> to God, and ought to <HI>love</HI> and <HI>thank</HI> him for our being, notwithstanding all we may be called to pass through, before we are received into <HI>his presence above,</HI> where is <HI>fulness of joy forever.</HI></P>
