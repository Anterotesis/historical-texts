I Shall now take notice of his Preface, to one called a <HI>Quaker</HI> in which he says

<P><HI>Answer.</HI> But every sincere Soul when they come to see the Texts themselves will have cause to think to the contrar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for had they been fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rly produced, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would have saved the labour of a furt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reply, they being far from countenance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any forced Maintenance to Christ's M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ers. And as for his Arguments Improv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they smell so strong of Persecution, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I would charitably hope no sober Christia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or Magistrate who inclines to Moderation (which ought to appear in all) will t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any further notice of them, than to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his ignorance.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding his mighty Arguments &amp; great Improvements, he gives them th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> blow,
<Q>He has but little hopes of his b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Convicted, (to whom he writes) becau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Efficacy of error and delusion &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>He would have had more reason to have writ so, if he had first proved error and

delusion upon him. And truly, he would have been greatly deluded, if he had be∣lieved that great Untruth: that forcing a maintenance for a Gospel Minister was warrantable from the Holy Scripture; if he be sober and in his w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, one would believe that he cannot (when he seriously considers of it) but be convinced that he is mistaken.</P>
<P>And as for his Prayers, the Scripture says; <HI>We know that God heareth not sinners:</HI> And that he is a Sinner, is plain, in wrest∣ing and perverting the Scriptures, as he has done, and as I shall shew through the help of Christ, my Lord and Saviour.</P>

<HEAD>Forcing a <HI>Maintenance, not</HI> Warrantable from the <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> for a <HI>Minister</HI> of the <HI>Gospel.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOW, pray let's Observe what he says to the matter in hand.</P>
<P N="1">1st. As to the Laws of <HI>New England</HI>; he says, <HI>The</HI> Laws <HI>of this Province require that the In∣habitants of each Town shall take due Care to be constantly provided with a</HI> Gospel Mini∣ster: <HI>And that each Minister shall be sufficie∣ntly supported and Maintained by the Inha¦bitants of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Town.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That all the Ratable Estates, and Inhi∣tants in the Town shall be Assessed, and pay proportionable to such Maintenance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And that such as refuse to pay accordingly, shall have their Proportion taken from them by Distress.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> I shall not here despute the In∣justice of this Law (only I must add, they have no such Example from Christ nor the Apostl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with this proviso, that it is made amongst a Society of men for themselves,
<PB N="2" REF="001669_0007_0FB4E2E3D45A24E0"/>
and those of their own Communion; but if this is intended to force those of other Professions and who cannot for Conscience sake joyn with them, believing them to be Antichristian Ministers, (as to be sure all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch are, as go about to maintain such Doctrine as this Priest <HI>Metcalfe</HI> doth: that it is warrantable from Scripture to force Maintenance for Ministers) Then would he be willing the Papists of Church of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> should take away from him? surely no: I say, that it is an unjust Law, and far from the nature of that Royal Law, which says. <HI>Do to all men as you would that they should do unto you</HI>; Christ says, <HI>This is the Law &amp; the Prophets.</HI> And doubtless the Gospel falls not short of it (though this <HI>N. E.</HI> Mi∣nister doth) tho' I hope it is not the mind of all in profession with him. Now the Law being unjust, it is no Crime to reject it: yet for Conscience sake, and the Lord's sake, we submit to it in passive obedience; and it is well known to all that know any thing of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> that their Principles is against resisting the outward Power.</P>
<P>Next to the question, <HI>Whether it be War∣rantable
<PB N="3" REF="001669_0008_0FB4E2E7D3198E90"/>
from Scripture and the Doctrine &amp; Practice of Christ and his Apostles to put such Laws in execution to take from men, and the Minister preaches not to them, for they cannot believe they are sent of God.</HI></P>
<P>This is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>Question</HI> as he states it in his first page, which he pretends to ans∣wer from Scripture, but falls far short of it; and he goes on thus.</P>
<P N="1">1st. <HI>It is Warrantable from Scripture &amp;c. that the Inhabitants of each Town should take due care, in order to their being supply'd with a Gospel Ministry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> this is as foreign from his questi∣on, as <HI>Rome</HI> is from <HI>Boston.</HI> What is that to the purpose? let the impartial judge; if he cannot prove a forced Maintenance from Scripture, he doth nothing to his pur∣pose, nor according to his Grand Question in his title page &amp;c.</P>
<P>Then he goes on to his second Assertion, and says.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>It is Warrantable from Scripture, that Gospel Ministers be honourably supported and maintained: such Maintenance is a debt due from the People to the Minister in strict
<PB N="4" REF="001669_0009_0FB4E2E9C736B5D0"/>
Justice and not as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>meer Act of Charity: for it is the here of their Labour, and the Wages of their work.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> Hereby he owns himself and all that are in his practice to be hirelings, tho' he will not allow others to call him or them so; and quotes these texts of Scrip∣ture to prove it. <HI>Luke</HI> 10 7. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.8. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.7, 14. <HI>Gall.</HI> 6.6. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17.18. and adds as fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly, and says,</P>
<P><Q>The Argument which the Apostle uses for the Gentiles Ministring to the Jews, reach∣es this case. <BIBL><HI>Romans 15.27.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> Surely the man forgets himself, for the Apostle only spoke of a free Col∣lection for the poor Saints at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as in the two foregoing verses plainly ap∣pears, v. 25. <HI>But now I go to Jerusalem to minister unto the Saints.</HI> 26 v. <HI>for it hath pleased them of Macedonia and A∣chaia to make a certain Contribution for the poor Saints at Jerusalem.</HI> When will our greedy Priests take so much Care of the poor?</P>
<P>As to the Texts of Scripture above quo∣ted, I shall take the pains to set them down
<PB N="5" REF="001669_0010_0FB4E2ECA9212108"/>
at large, that the Reader may see how they Answer his Grand Question: for what pur∣pose he concealed them (in his) in figures is best known to himself. Truly if he had set them down at large it must needs have been plainly manifested, to every body that should read them, that he was in the wrong: for they assert no such thing, as he would have them to prove, viz a forced Main∣tenance for Gospel Ministers. The first is <HI>Luke</HI> 10 7.
<Q>And in the same house re∣main eating and drinking such things as they give (What could be more against him? for the Labourer is worthy of his Hire: Go not from house to house, and into what city ye enter and they receive you▪ eat such things as are set before you.</Q>
(where is legal force here?)</P>
<P>Let this man have a care lest he be one of those that are blinded: for he must needs be blind if he cannot see that this holy Text makes not for his purpose, but directly against him; here is not a word of Legal force. it is so far from it that they were only to eat what was set before them, if they received them who were true Mi∣nisters
<PB N="6" REF="001669_0011_0FB4E2EE322B1BF0"/>
sent of Christ, which yet will be hard¦work for persecuting Priests to prove them∣selves so; be they of what Religion they may. Well, what shall we do for this Legal force? why truly we cannot find it in the Gospel, or the New-Testament Christ came to fulfil the Law and change the Priesthood, and put an End to C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Ordinances. But it may be <HI>Joseph M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣calfe</HI> is an Old-Testament man, as a cer¦tain <HI>N: E:</HI> Convert said on occasion well known to some of them) if he be, and will follow the Letter of the Law, he must go to knocking down Oxen, and killing of Sheep, which work I believe they of his Cloath are generally too high for.</P>
<P>The next is 2 <HI>Cor</HI> 8.11.
<Q>I Robb'd other Churches, taking Wages of them to do you service.</Q></P>
<P>Surely can any body be so bold as from this Text to say that the Apostle made a common practice of Preaching for Wages, as our modern Priests do now a days? I hope, no Christian will imagin from those words of the Apostle that he was a Thief, or a Sacrilegious person, but only a free∣dom of speech which he used to those
<PB N="7" REF="001669_0012_0FB4E2F0069D9E68"/>
whom he loved, as in v. 11. is plainly ex∣pressed. It is a familiar way of expression among our gselves where we know we may be free when any thing is given to us from our Friend. Oh I shall Rob thee too muche to put any other construction upon the Apostle's words would be to make the A∣postle a Sacrilegious person and a Robber which is absurd. But pray let him speak fairly a little for himself and he will wipe of these Money loving Priests very hand∣somly. v. 7. <HI>I have,</HI> says he, <HI>Preached to you the Gospel of God freely.</HI> Oh that curting word <HI>freely</HI> what shall we do with it? tho' it was so near our legal Minister yet he thought fit not to medle with it and in the 9th. verse (just under, as the 7th. just above, by which the poor man is hedged in, how he will get out I know not) the Apostle says, <HI>and when I was present with you and wanted I was chorgeable to no men,</HI> And tells them in the same verie that he kept himself from being burthensome to them, and that he resolved to keep himself so. We dare all those that Preach for hire, and have money for Divining to come to such a resolution. However if they will
<PB N="8" REF="001669_0013_0FB4E2F1095651E0"/>
not come to this good Resolution, let them forbear abusing and Persecuting those that (by the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ) are.</P>

<P><HI>Joseph</HI> hath left out what he thought made against him, from the 8 v. to the 13th and 15 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. where Holy <HI>Paul</HI> says, (though he had Power to eat and drink v. 4 at free cost▪ yet he doth not say any where that he had Power to take it by force and we think it ought to be Preached from an Inward necessity, and not for an outward Maintenance) <HI>I have used none of these things neither have I written those things that it should be so done unto me.</HI> I wish <HI>Jo∣seph Metcalfe</HI> and others in his station could say so honestly.</P>
<P>Now I may proceed to say somthing to
<PB N="9" REF="001669_0014_0FB4E2F2A75B64C8"/>
each particular above, as it lyeth in the holy Text.</P>
<P>And 1st. <HI>Who goeth a W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fare at his own Charge</HI>? there are some tho' very few, I could heartily wish that there were more that would follow his Practice that wrote it, who himself was one that did sometimes do it, as there, when he wrought at his lawful Calling, and helpt those that were with him; and blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, there are some who do go on in this Holy War∣fare of Preaching the Gospel in this Age of the World at their own Charge, who have nothing to boast of neither; for a necessity is laid upon them, and Wo is unto them if they Preach not the Gospel. Though if any be poor and want help we have no∣thing against it, but are for helping of those who can give a good account of their Cal∣ling, and we are so free to do it that we need no forcing to it, nor no Law for it.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Who Planteth a Vineyard and eat∣eth not of the fruit thereof?</HI></P>
<P>Well, he that hath Planted a Vineyard
<PB N="10" REF="001669_0015_0FB4E2F4425398A8"/>
let him eat the fruit of it and welcome, but let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n leave other folks Vineyards alone, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he be counted a Robber in the worst sense; for if he H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Apostle Rob∣bed it was by consent but these Preachers now adays R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b without consent, even Vineyards which they never Planted, but would destroy if they could. Oh High base and Antichristian Practice with a witness!</P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>Who feedeth a Flock and eateth not of the Milk thereof?</HI> But who seedeth a Flock and Milks the Flocks of others?</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> Antichrist an Persecutors, that cannot be content with the Milk that their own flocks give, but will needs be m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king and fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing too those poor Sheep which cannot in Conscience joyn with them, believing that their way is not the door into the true Sheepfold, but that they are climbing up some other way like thieves and Robbers. And because the poor Sheep of the true Shepherd Jesus Christ▪ bleat forth those things those inwardly Raven∣ing Wolves, who have got only the Sheep's Cloathing outwardly, being known to be such by their fruits of Persecution,
<PB N="11" REF="001669_0016_0FB4E2F7A95C3DD8"/>
will needs put the poor Sheep in their Pounds when and where they have power, or else take it by force, that is to say <HI>Legal</HI> forsooth.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they that Preach the Gospel shall Live of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>Yes he hath ordained that they should Live, but not that they should force a Li∣ving. A blessed Ordination, and with Holy Reverence been repeated; for and because every true Minister of Jesus knows the sweet benefit of it in a twofold sense: 1st He hath a holy Living for his Soul, he is richly fed at his Great Masters table with the finest of the Wheat, and as with the holy Honey, or sweetness of the Word of Eternal Life, which is strength to him in Weakness, Riches to him in Poverty and joy and peace to him in Persecution which the World and all the Persecutor therein can never take away from him blessed be God in Christ forever.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. As to his bodily Living, if he b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a true man and not a lover of filthy lucr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or gain, he will have cause to say as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="12" REF="001669_0017_0FB4E2FD4D40DA50"/>
Great Masters servants did of old, that he la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ked nothing, especially if his Call is from God and Christ, and not from Man or Money. On this money that is a loud Call indeed to our men made Ministers: If at any time there chance to be two Calls. I always observed that the highest bidder carry'd the Priest. But where shall we find that the Lord hath ordained that a Minister shall have fifty or an hundred pounds per Annum? (in all the Holy Records) for Preaching the Gospel no, our Great High-Priest said to his, <HI>Freely ye have received, freely give.</HI> But if it had been his mind he could as well, and with as great and as good Authority as any of these men, have said, if they will not give it you freely take it by force. But those forcers know not what Spirit they are of: if they do, they must needs be the greater Hypocrites, and so their Condemnation the greater.</P>
<P>Gall 6 6. <HI>Let him that is taught in the Word Communicate unto him that teaches it all Good things.</HI></P>
<P>Yes, let those which these men Teac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Communicate to them: For Communica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="13" REF="001669_0018_0FB4E2FF450EB938"/>
and Legal force are words of different sig∣nification. I hope by this time this Preach∣ers eyes will be opened to see his error, in pleading for Legal forced Maintenance, especially from Christ's and the Apostles Practice and Doctrine as Recorded in the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P>The next Text which he quotes is 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 17.18.
<Q>Let the Elders which Rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they which labour in the Word and Doctrine, for the Scripture saith, Thou shalt not m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zzel the Ox that tread∣eth out the Corn, and the Labourer is worthy of his Reward.</Q></P>
<P>Very well, what is this to his Legal force? here is nothing of it, those that Rule well will not force any body nor set the Magi∣strates upon their backs, because they can∣not conform to their ways; Those must be Antichristian Teachers for certain, being opposite to Christ: for he indeed was Persecuted, but never Persecuted any, nor forced any tho' it was in his power: for which reason we cannot give those men that double honour which they desire;
<PB N="14" REF="001669_0019_0FB4E300C47BA8C8"/>
and for those who say they labour in the Word and Doctrine of our meek Lord, to set the Magistrates upon us is wicked Rul∣ing instead of Ruling well.</P>
<P>And as for the poor Ox that treads out the Corn, I am far from having him muz∣zled: But when he bites, and with his horns pushes the Sheep, and tramples the growing green Corn to dirt, I think then he ought to be M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zzled and hoppled too.</P>
<P>In his 2d. page he says,
<Q><HI>3dly.</HI> It is the duty of every Inhabitant in a town to pay proportionable towards Ministers Main∣tenance.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> No if they are not all of one per∣swasion, (and if they were all of one per∣swasion he hath no such President from Christ nor the Apostles to force, neither Legal nor illegal &amp; are as free in the choice of such Minister; he runs too fast there, without he is Popishly inclined, to perse∣cute every body into his perswasion, which has been too much the practice of some of the <HI>N.

All which is a shame to moderate Christians; some of which, of all perswasions I hope there are in the Country and Territories of <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P>For first says he.

<P N="3">3dly. In page 2d. he says,
<Q>The Apostle

<Q>Much more ought there to be a proportion or equality observed in the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n∣tenance of the Ministry wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er of Communicative Justice so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Law and so it should be under the Gospel.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> Notwithstanding these Priests will bring those Texts of Holy Scripture, that tend to promote Charity to the Poor, and many instances out of antient Authors for stirring up Charity to the Poor▪ yet they will not, when it comes to their case, allow it to be as Charity but a debt: as saith our Author in his first page, and <HI>J. Mather</HI> in a little book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> promote the Maintenance of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in which I obs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rve he tells them <HI>If th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y will stand to the old Law of the Jews they must have but a tenth of the tenth,</HI> which I suppose will not satisfie those men that have H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re for Preaching and M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ney for Divining: and therefore I think it their
<PB N="18" REF="001669_0023_0FB4E30FC8356CD8"/>
best way to let the Jews old Law alone, and take to the new Law and Covenant of our Great Lord Jesus.</P>
<P>And further if they will bring instance of Charity to the Poor out of Scripture and other Authors let them be just, and always when they would make the appli∣cation of it to the Ministry, to put honest∣ly the word <HI>Poor</HI> before Ministry, viz. po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Priest▪ poor Minister, otherwise let th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m let till their argument for Charity to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Poor (which no good Christian will go about to dispute against) and set what their arguments for Justice in the case will do for them. They say it is a just Debt a matter of Communicative Justice but when people do not see cause to Commu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h them but quite the contrary, and buy none of their ware or merchandize, pray what Justice is there in this? Why truly none, but a great deal of injustice.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. He says,
<Q>If any man fail of doing his just proportion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he thereby exposes either the Minister to loose so much of his just due (<HI>but he fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s short of proving it a just due</HI>) or the other Inhabitants to pay

Thus he and they building their structure of Maintenance upon a bad foundation, viz. Legal force, it will fall to the ground if the Magistrates do not help; for whose help he calls very loud, and well he may, considering he and others of his mind are ready to faint and fall without it. But by what hath been said, I would charitably hope all moderate Christian Magistrates will take care that the Preachers eat only the Grapes of their own Vine, and the Milk of their own flock and keep so far just as to let other folks Grapes
<PB N="20" REF="001669_0025_0FB4E312D6E77EB0"/>
and Milk alone. But if the Priests and M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trates will joyn together in Persecu∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, when will we poor sufferers Appeal from them to our Great High Priest, and J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Judge of Heaven and Earth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gh his Grace patiently Suffer what be shall please to permit to come upon us.</P>
<P N="5">5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hly. In his 3d. page he says,
<Q>The Pub∣lick Ministry of the Gospel in any town is a publick priviledge, and every Inhabitant is considered therein, and partakes in the pri∣viledge: for the Preaching of the Gospel is the Great Engine of Salvation, and means of Faith. <BIBL>Rom. 1.16.10.17.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>If he means that there is no other preach∣ing the Gospel but from his Sect, we open∣ly declare to the World that we differ from him in our Judgment, and we believe upon good grounds too. And what Gospel or Glad Tidings (which the word imports) can that be to people to preach to them, <HI>That a certain number of them are Eternally ordained for Damnation</HI>; And for ought these knowing men know, they may them∣selves be some of them, for they cannot tell who these Damned ones are. I think it
<PB N="21" REF="001669_0026_0FB4E3143A7FEBF0"/>
would be abundantly better if those pry∣ing Ministers would let the Secret Will of him that made them alone: for that be∣longs to God and not to M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>The Re∣vealed Truths belong to us and our Children.</HI> And to tell people they can never be free from the act of Sin while in this World is really miserable news, and dreadful tidings indeed, since Sin is the cause of God's Wrath, and Damnation, and since we can∣not in Conscience joyn with such Antigos∣pel Ministers, they ought not in Conscience to take our money or goods from us.</P>
<P>Again he says <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><HI>Every one is invited to take "of the Water of Life freely</HI> Rev. 26.17.</P>
<P>But, by their leave, theirs is the Water of Death, if we must always Sin even in our best duties, then he knows that the wages of sin is Death; &amp; may not any good Christi∣ans be truly thankful when they are de∣livered from such a sinful Ministry. And what a knock he gives himself in saying <HI>We take of it freely,</HI> and his pages are wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on purpose to make people believe they ought to pay for it; and that they may force it from them too. So we may plain∣ly see, that their Waters, which proceed
<PB N="22" REF="001669_0027_0FB4E31B09462D10"/>
from them in such bitter streams, are the Waters of Death: because we cannot have them freely according to the Doctrine of the Holy Ghost in the Holy Scripture, which himself hath brought.</P>
<P>Again whereas he says,
<Q>Where there is no Vision, or Preaching the Gospel, the Peo∣ple perish. <BIBL>Prov. 29.18.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This is contrary to what they say when they teach that Vision and Revelation is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eased.</P>
<P>He goes on,
<Q>Being without God without Christ, without the Covenant, they are in a hopeless perishing condition.</Q></P>
<P>If he would infer from these words that where there is no publick Vocal Teaching the people Perish, the Almighty has been kinder than this Minister: for he has Graci∣ously promised that he would Teach his people himself: <HI>The Children of the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re taught of the Lord &amp;c.

(not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n) Now to say that such who have not outward vocal Preaching perish, is absur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and be must want charity, and then all his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es in his Pulpit are but like sound∣ing brass.</P>
<P>But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow says he,
<Q>Where the Kingdom of God is Preached, every man is at liberty and hath an opportunity to be pressing into it▪ (and I and without paying for it) <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke 16 16</HI> But where the Kingdom of Satan is Preached, <HI>(which is S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n term of Life)</HI> The people have liberty to fly from it <HI>Further he says,</HI></Q>
<HI>If any refuse the Counsel of God "against themselves it is their own fault.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any do so it is their own fault indeed: but to refuse the counsel of a sin∣ful Minister is a vertue, and no fault at all.</P>
<P>Again,
<Q>They have a Price put in their own hand, altho' being fools they have no heart to improve it.</Q></P>
<P>We are willing to be counted fools by such wiselings; but let him know that
<PB N="24" REF="001669_0029_0FB4E31EC8CC51C0"/>
Wisdom himself said, <HI>He that will be Wise, must first become a fool.</HI></P>
<P>He proceeds and says,
<Q>It was a privi∣ledge to them that were invited to the Mar∣riage of the King's Son, tho' they made light of the invitation and would not come <BIBL><HI>Mat. 22.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Those that rightly come to the Mar∣riage of the King's Son, the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world, must put of the Garment spotted with the Flesh, lest it he said to them, <HI>Friend how camest thou in hither not having on the Wedding Gar∣ment</HI>?

<P>Now says he,
<Q>Every Inhabitant partak∣ing in the Publick priviledge of a Gospel Ministry, Reason and Justice requires that
<PB N="25" REF="001669_0030_0FB4E3204C5AE338"/>
every one should bear a part of the external Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge in order to the Maintenance of it.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> But every person not partaking of what he calls so, &amp; believing that, as those erroneous Priests preach it, to be a bondage and not a priviledge, to force such to pay too, it is altogether unreasonable, and great injustice; let all sensible Christians judge.</P>
<P N="4">4thly▪ H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> says,
<Q>It is Warrantable from Scripture, that such Inhabitants as refuse to pay any thing towards the support of the Ministry should have their just proportion taken from them by Legal Distress.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans</HI> We want him or any of his breth∣ren to shew us that Warrat from Holy Scrip∣ture; for he hath not done it yet: and where shall we find that it is Warrantable from Scripture and the Doctrine and Prac∣tice of Christ and his Apostles? for what he has produced from Holy Scripture has fairly proved to the contrary, and as for his <HI>Legallity</HI> that great word, it's only what others of his Spirit have pleaded in for∣mer Ages; did not <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>buchadnezzer</HI> per∣secute the Servants of God by a Law? could

D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not the People of <HI>Massechusets</HI> make a Law and by it hang the poor innocent Quakers? Did not all those say that those suffered Legally? And do not some of the <HI>N.

<P><HI>Oh but</HI> say our Modern Teachers (who have money for it) <HI>We hope you will not com∣pare us Christians to Jews and Heathens.</HI></P>
<P>Why not, if found in their Practices? for when once people go to Persecute o∣thers for their Conscientious desent, it is must certain they go from the Spirit of Christ as may fairly be proved from Christ's own expressions; and doubtless all Perse∣cuters are Antichrists, notwithstanding their finely guilding of it over with the words <HI>Legal Distress</HI> and <HI>Prosecution.</HI></P>
<P>In his fourth page he begins thus,
<Q><HI>For it is a just and legal d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bt as has already been proved</HI> (to those that agree to it and con∣tract it he should have added.)</Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="001669_0032_0FB4E32858349FF0"/><HI>Ans.</HI> But unjust and illegal to those that cannot for Conscience take consent to it, and therefore it's a mistake in him to say, <HI>It has already been proved,</HI> for he hath not, nor cannot prove it, (nor to force any by a coercive power) to be consonant to the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P>In page the 4th. he says,
<Q>God has given his Ministers a Just Right to some Pro∣portion of every man's Estate, in the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace where they Minister.</Q></P>
<P>What, J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ws H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>athens and all? what every man whatsoever? where proves he that? For my part if I were a Minister for money, I should think that what I got from other people against their wills would never prosper, but would be a curse to, and upon me, and tend to the consumption of the rest of my estate, rather then augment∣ing of it: And I have heard some moderate Ministers who have money for their preach∣ing, to say the same.</P>
<P>He goes on further and says,
<Q>And that part of each man's Estate which God gives Ministers a Right to by his just and equal Law.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="001669_0033_0FB4E32A78B84B50"/><HI>Ans</HI> By his just and equal Gospel he f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rces none; but leaves every one to be fully perswaded in their own minds.</P>
<P>And he must needs say, <HI>That the Gospel Power exceeds the Power of any Law what∣soever.</HI></P>
<P>And the Gospel is free, not forced as he vainly would endeavour to prove from Holy Scripture. That must be an unjust Law that forces people to buy whether they will or no: and therefore none of God's Law or way: for all his Laws and ways are equal.</P>
<P>And he also says in page the 4th.
<Q>They have as much Power to challenge it as any other Debt or Wages.</Q></P>
<P>No, without people agree with them and hire them. (And tho' they do agree with them, I no ways grant that they have any colour from the New Testament to make any such Law even among them∣selves; it being inconsistant with the nature of the Glorious Gospel of Christ) Upon which a passage comes into my mind be∣tween an Indian and a <HI>N.

England,</HI> who took from a Dissenter from the Presbyterian way (for Preaching) one of his Cows, the Indian asked him why he did so the Priest answered <HI>If I hired you to make a fence for me would you not expect your Wages</HI>? Yet says the Indian, <HI>But he no hire you, and when me do man's work then M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n pay me, but when you do God work then God pay you.</HI></P>
<P>The poor Indian was in the right, for truly God's pay is better then all the Silver and Gold in the world.</P>
<P><HI>O But</HI>▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay they, <HI>how must we Live</HI>?</P>
<P>If they had Faith in God and Christ they need not fear a living in this world.</P>
<P><HI>But,</HI> say they, <HI>the People are so hard heart∣ed▪ that if there were not a Law for it the Mi∣nister might starve.</HI></P>
<P>Then their Doctrine must starve the peo∣ple's Souls, or eise sure they would not let their bodies starve: that must needs be a lifeless dull dead Ministry that will not o∣pen people's hearts, so as to keep the preach∣ers from starving. But I think there is no fear of their starving, for they generally live like Lords among the people. But let

<P><Q>It is <HI>says he,</HI> agreeable to the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles that such as re∣fuse to pay their just debts should be distrain∣ed for the same by vertue of a civil Sword a∣mongst Christians <BIBL><HI>Rom. 13.14.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>

<P>In page the 5 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. he talks on the Law and Light of Nature, and Reason, and says, "<HI>It's the Law of God written in the Heart.</HI> "Rom 2.15. He adds,

<P><HI>Ans.</HI> But there is a wonderfull jarr be∣tween the corrupt Nature, or Law of Man and the Divine Nature or Law of God; he should have distinguished between the corrupt Nature, Reason and Law, and the Divine: for except he rightly divides be∣tween the precious &amp; the vile, he cannot be

<P>But the Divine Nature in Christ and his Apostles says▪ <HI>Freely you have received freely give.</HI> If their Gospel is not free they have not received it from Christ.

And that it is not Covetousness, that divers Quakers so called cannot pay the covetous Priests is manifest; for they take as much more and somtimes double and triple, as I could easily bring many instances and living witnessess to prove what I assert, from <HI>Virginia, Maryland</HI> and abundantly in <HI>New England,</HI> without going

<P>He goes on, and endeavours to animate and stir up the Magistrates to Persecution, by insinuating that those who for Con∣science sake cannot give any thing to the Priests, are evil, unjust and wicked persons; who notwithstanding take them in a gene∣ral way and their conversations are as just as the brightest of their Church Members, as divers of themselves are forced to ac∣knowledge.</P>
<P>If for this testimony to our Innocency, any should imagine we boast, it's he, and such as he that are the occasion of this confident boasting, and we have our Great Apostle even <HI>Paul</HI> for our example.</P>
<P>Now I hope the Magistrates will take care how they Persecute the just and turn the edge of their Swords against the evil doers: and then doubtless they will not
<PB N="34" REF="001669_0039_0FB4E338C616AF70"/>
bear their Swords in vain, and then let the edge of it be as sharp and keen as it will, we fear it not: for against true men there is no Law which is upon a just Basis or foundation that will harm them.</P>
<P>Now I tenderly and lovingly, as a Min∣ister of Jesus Christ and true Lover of good Government, exhort and warn all Magi∣strates to be careful to keep within their own Province: for <HI>Conscience</HI> is none of theirs; it is the peculiar Province of Je∣sus Christ, the Great Territores of the King of Kings and Judge of the Quick and Dead; and he will render unto every man a Recompence.</P>
<P>Now if Conscience were only a Cloak for Covetousness it ought to be stript off, but it is plain that T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at cannot be our case: for we lose as much more by our denial, and somtimes a great deal more than as much more, by our not paying freely as it is abovesaid. But we may I hope) pre∣sume that the Magistrates know their duty without being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aught it from the Pulpit. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould have no free spirited Magistrate to let the Priests Ride them: for if they
<PB N="35" REF="001669_0040_0FB4E33A9E2043D8"/>
do it is to be doubted they will Ride them to death: for Persecu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing men of their Cloth seem to have but little Mercy. I once heard a Priest say to a couple of Just∣ices a <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> Preacher for money, but as himself said to some of his neighbours a Presbyterian in his heart) <HI>Do your Office,</HI> which was upon my poor self who had been Preaching against Sin and Evil according to the best of my un∣derstanding why what's the matter?) <HI>He has been Preaching</HI> says the Priest <HI>in a place not Licenc'd and has broke the Law. Well,</HI> says another Justice beside the aforesaid two <HI>then you have broke the Law first for you Preach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d before him,</HI> and tho' it was our M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting by appointment, yet we quiet∣ly heard him read his Sermon, and I dare say he never had quieter hearers in all his days than we were.</P>
<P>And indeed R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ading is the general prac∣tice of some Modern Teachers, far from the pract<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of Christ the Apostles and Primitive Christians when Christianity shone in it's Primitive Beauty and Glory, and when Christians depended more upon
<PB N="36" REF="001669_0041_0FB4E33D26416948"/>
the gift of the Holy Ghost (or Spirit) and less upon natural parts &amp; human inventions, which is worthy of the solid consideration of all true Christians.</P>
<P>I have also observed that those Magi∣strates which have joyned with Persecuting Priest'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Persecuting men of sober lives and conversations for their Religious Dis∣sent, that they have not prospered, and many sober people not of our society have taken notice of the same. This is offered to the serious considerations of Men of high Degree (in Reverence and great Hu∣mility.)</P>
<P>And tho' <HI>J. M.</HI> flatters the Magistrates, telling them they bear the visible Image and Character of Gods, in order to flatter them into a persecuting Spirit, yet I hope and believe that he will not find many Ma∣gistrates nor Ministers of his mind: for if all the Magistrates and Ministers in <HI>N. E.</HI> were as much for Persecution as he seems to be by his writing what might all those expect who differ from the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> way in <HI>N. E.</HI> if they had Power? But Blessed be God, I certainly know that there are
<PB N="37" REF="001669_0042_0FB4E34119E93978"/>
divers moderate people, who are against Persecution, even amongst the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> in <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P>In his page 7<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h. he says,
<Q>In case of peo∣ple's defect in this matter, <HI>(of paying for Preaching)</HI> Legal Compulsion is the only Remedy <HI>(what no other Remedy?<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> and must be used otherwise Religion which is a People's Life will soon fall to the ground.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Where will his Doctrine land? What cannot Christ uphold his Church without the Magistrates? The Religion of Christ, the Apostles and Primitive Christians stood and stands yet without being supported by the civil Magistrates. What has he got some new Religion which cannot stand without the outward Power? But it seems some of the <HI>N E.</HI> Ministers reckon that they must fall if the Magistrates do not uphold them. <HI>They</HI> (i. e. the Magi∣strates) <HI>are</HI> says <HI>J. Mather, the Keeper of both Tables.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> But I thought that God had been the <HI>Keeper</HI> of his People, and Christ the <HI>Shepherd</HI> of his Sheep, and the Holy Ghost the <HI>Comforter</HI> of them; I thought this In∣finit
<PB N="38" REF="001669_0043_0FB4E3420B875EC8"/>
Being had been the Great Preserver of men in Religion.</P>
<P>In his 8th. page▪ he brings divers texts of Scripture to prove the Power of the Magistrates, which we never denied, espe∣cially when he ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcises his Power and Authority to the terror of evil doers, and the praise of them that do well And at the latter end of the said page he says,
<Q>From the whole I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onclude with submission to better judgments that it's Warrantable from Scripture, and agreable from the Doc∣trine and Practice of Christ and his Apostles, for the Laws aforesaid to be put in execu∣tion.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> But alas this is all beside his asser∣tion, his business wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to prove a Legal forc∣ed Maintenance for Gospel Ministers or else he doth nothing. What! hath he been travelling through all his pages, and brought forth nothing but this windy D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctrine at last? He speaks of submission to better judgments, and I would have him, if he dare to do it, submit to the judg∣ment of Christ and his Apostles, who I think have fairly decided the question in
<PB N="39" REF="001669_0044_0FB4E3438280EE20"/>
favour to the poor abused Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kers, that it is not according but contrary to the language of the Holy Ghost in the Holy Scripture, that Gospel Ministers Mainte∣nance should be forced by a Coercive Power. From what has been said, let all ingenuous Christian Readers judge.</P>
<P>In page the 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h
<Q>Nevertheless <HI>says he,</HI> if any Arguments can be produced from Scripture or right Reason of greater strength and weight to prove the Negative then there may be to maintain the Affirmitive, I hope I shall readily subscribe thereto.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> A body would from those expres∣sions almost hope for a recantation from him, especially if he seriously considers the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles as here noted at large.</P>
<P><Q>But <HI>saith he</HI> till I receive further Light, Conscience commands me to conform to that measure I have.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> He had best to have a care of the Commanding Pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> evil Conscience.</P>
<P>He goes on,
<Q>And while I do Conscien∣teously conform to that measure of Light within me walking in Obedience to all it's Commands and directions.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="001669_0045_0FB4E34548029538"/><HI>Ans.</HI> But suppose that Light in him should be Darkness, then, as Christ said, <HI>How great is that Darkness</HI>? A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for certain, it is when he goes about to prove that for truth which is contrary to Christ's Doc∣trine.</P>
<P>As to his saying,
<Q>Then the Quakers must let fall the Grand Article of their Re∣ligion.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans</HI> Let him seriously read over the first chapter of <HI>John,</HI> as also many other places of the Holy Scripture on that Subject of the <HI>Light,</HI> and if he is not one of those which are blinded, perhaps he may be undeceived, and his gross mistake rectified. I hope he is careful of preaching such doctrine in his Pulpit.</P>
<P>A certain Church Member of the Pres∣byterian way in <HI>N. E.</HI> told me, that their Minister told them in his Pulpit, <HI>That we deny'd the Bible or Holy Scriptures.</HI> And made the poor woman really to believe it to be true, (than which nothing could be more false) but the honest woman thought she would try me, <HI>Was you</HI> says she, <HI>brought up among Quakers? Was your Father and
<PB N="41" REF="001669_0046_0FB4E3476D00A528"/>
Mother Quakers?</HI> Yes said I▪ they were so c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. <HI>And</HI> says she, <HI>would they suffer you to read in the Bible when you were a little boy</HI>? Yes &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orrect me too, because I was not so willing to do it as they would have me to be.</P>
<P>Thus have the poor Quakers been a∣bused in divers Pulpits in <HI>N. E.</HI> and other places, for which reason I would give this Christian advice to all profest Christian Mi∣nisters in <HI>N. E.</HI> and elsewhere, wherever this may meet with them. That for the time to come they do not tell the people in their Pulpits that the Quakers deny Christ, the Scriptures, the Power of the Magistrates, and many other things which would ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ume of themselves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> For them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> out in their Pulpits <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a care of the Delusions of the Quakers</HI> and at the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to de∣lude the people to believe lyes of them, is really horrid.</P>
<P><HI>Oh but</HI> says they <HI>the Quakers are more Orthodox now then they were,</HI> (when in truth its th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that have been cast on us are now made more manifest) and

then ought not they to be glad at the news of our Reformation</P>
<P>T. C.</P>
<P>NOw I shall consider his <HI>Postscript,</HI> in writing of which he has dip't his Penn deep in the Gall of bitterness in some parts of it, which I shall touch a little upon as I shall come to them.</P>
<P>But to begin,
<Q>Notwithstanding <HI>says he,</HI> all that I have said in the preceeding dis∣course concerning Maintenance: yet as to my own particular if a Temporal mainte∣nance had been my chief aim, I should have discovered great folly in accepting a Call from so small and poor a people.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> From his words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may conclude it was his aim tho' not his chief aim; and then as to those Shepherd's Call, ought it not to be from the Great Shepherd Jesus Christ? And if they will answer his Call, he says <HI>Go forth,</HI> where do we find any example for a Minister of the Gospel to stay and Preach only to one particular Con∣gregation? pray let them produce it if they can.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="001669_0048_0FB4E34F8BF80E70"/>But now suppose a place should present where the People were Richer and more of them, would he not leave his poor flock to go to the rich? Pray let him have a care as he says, that his own heart do not deceive him: We but too plainly perceive by the practice of these money Ministers, that the loudest Call is the most money. I query upon this grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> word <HI>Call,</HI> whether the Sheep use to call the shepherd, or the shepherd the Sheep? Do not they strange∣ly invert the Order or Nature here in their pretended Call from the People? Christ the true Shepherd said. <HI>My Sheep hear my Voice.</HI> So that he and his Servants call the Sheep and not the Sheep them; and those Holy Shepherds called their Sheep freely, though these must have Money for their calling, and the Sheep call them too: nei∣ther will that satisfy some of those Shep∣herds, but they will needs have money from some poor Sheep that never called them; and if they will not give it the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> freely they will have it by force, as a youn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shepherd said to one a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Salem</HI> in <HI>N E. Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tho' Paul had Power and did not use it, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="44" REF="001669_0049_0FB4E3510C344098"/>
would use his Power.</HI> But that blessed A∣postle never pretended to any forceable Power, except the force and power of Love.</P>
<P>He the said <HI>J. M.</HI> complains of the small income for Preaching and of his poverty, tho' it's probable he has more than all the twelve Apostles when they were sent forth by their great Lord and Master; and to be sure he has more for Preaching than they all had, but he has confessed his Call is not Divine, therefore not from Christ, for he says, "<HI>If he had a Divine Call, he "could forego every thing in the World.</HI> And so he is but a Legal literal Preacher and Minister, a Minister that forces himself to Offer, and would also force those who receive not his Offering to pay him tho' against their Conscience.</P>
<P>And as to his Family's starving I never heard nor read of any Christian Minister's Family's starving especially in a Christian country, nor I believe he nor any body else. Certainly there is need to cry out to those men, <HI>O ye of little Faith? Who cloaths the Lilies, and feeds the Sparrows, shall not he take care of you? O ye of little Faith!</HI> I
<PB N="45" REF="001669_0050_0FB4E352DC5232C8"/>
fear they forget the Doctrine of him whom they somtimes call their Lord.</P>
<P>As to what he writes in his second page of his Postscript if he du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y minds what I have writ in answer to his I think he cannot imagine that the Flaming Vengeance there poured out by him upon us, can any way touch us, but let him and them which are concerned in this work (for I understand he had the help of a cunning man in this his work) have a care that it fail not on themselves: and truly the poor Quakers may be truly thankful that the Flaming Sword is not in their hands; for if it were experience, yea woful experience, hath taught us that we might expect but little Mercy from some of them And pray why cannot they be more patient, since they hold that God hath ordained whatev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r comes to pass? For they see it is come to pass that we cannot j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n with them can∣not they let the ordinance of God alone? I remember an expression of <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> in one of his scurrilous pieces that the best way to deal with the Quakers was to let them alone. Then according to <HI>C. M.</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="001669_0051_0FB4E3560309F828"/>
this man and he that helpt him has taken the worst way to deal with us: and truly they loose ground generally when they meddle with us.</P>
<P>As for his foolish pity and bitter lamen∣tation over us we desire that they would lament over themselves and their children, as our Saviour did the Jews when they Persecuted; and truly those who justify their forefathers in hanging the Quakers and their other ways, so bitterly Persecut∣ing them as they did, had not only need to lament, but to repent too. And even now they prove themselves to be the Per∣secutors (and not we) by forcing their maintenance from us. The Presbyterians in <HI>O E</HI> alias <HI>Great Britain,</HI> they are one with us in this Doctrine, that forcing a Maintenance for Ministers from them that do not hear them is altogether wrong and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st: And how comes it to pass that the same people are otherwise minded in <HI>New England?</HI> Let them resolve this question.</P>
<P>I shall consider those Texts of Scripture which he has thrown at us (and gently re∣turn them unto him again.)</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="001669_0052_0FB4E3584262C378"/>At the end of his Postscript he says,
<Q>The Judgments of God are a great Deep. <HI>(Yes too deep for his Legal literal buckets to fetch them up) Rom. 11.7.</HI> The Election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded.</Q></P>
<P>I hope he will give the Almighty leave to Elect whom he pleaseth. Was the E∣lection in the power of this Priest? Let the Reader judge whether we might expect any of it.</P>
<P>He cites, 2 Cor. 4 3 "<HI>If our Gospel be "hid. it is hid to those who are lost.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Now why did this Priest hide the fourth and next verse, was it not for fear the Light of the Quakers Doctrine should shine unto people? which is thus, (the fourth verse opening and explaining the third) <HI>In whom the God of this World hath blinded the mind, of them which believe not: least the Light of the Glorious Gospel of Christ who is the Image of God should shine into them.</HI> or as in the 6th verse, <HI>For God who Com∣manded Light to shine out of Darkness he hath shined in our hearts to give us the Light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of his Son our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> He
<PB N="48" REF="001669_0053_0FB4E35ABB6356B0"/>
thought good to hide this Gospel. but I think good to make it manifest; which puts me in mind of a proverb, <HI>Who is so blind as those who will not see.</HI></P>
