<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here comes her father. I don't suppose he had much hand in it; for so he had his afternoon's nap in quiet, he was always for letting things go as they would. So, Master Easy, you have consented, I find, to marry your daughter to another, after promising me over and over, that nobody should have her but me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>My wife desired me.</P>

<P>Your mind is strangely altered, farmer Easy. But do me one piece of justice however—tell me, who is it you intend for your son in law?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a rich one, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so you have broke your word, and all for the

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they're a vile pack of wretches, and I'll get away from them as soon as I can. Go on, go on—let me know all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are in a passion, child, so I don't regard what you say: but I think I should have been out of my wits to have refused Mr. Steady, the rich Quaker.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, is it he then?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same. You have seen the nature of it—That <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ger who can boaft of having done the most ingenious <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, claims a right to demand a farm, containing sixty <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, rent free for seven years, and a hundred pounds to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it, together with whatever maiden he chooses, pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> he gains her consent: and it is a good custom; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e young men who formerly us'd to vie with one <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>her in the feats of strength, now, as I may say, vie <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one another in feats of understanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so he is to marry your daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EASY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Things are as I tell you, And for that purpose he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>en Gillian into his own house, had her taught music <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d to say the truth, she is a different thing to what she <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s when you saw her last.</P>

<P>But since she has changed her mind; and it so falls out, that to-morrow is May-day, you would do well to study some ingenious thing, and get this portion for a more de∣serving damsel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN</SPEAKER>
<P>No farmer Easy; her using me ill is no reason why I should do any thing to make me angry with myself; I swore to love her for ever, and I'll keep my word, though I see she has broke hers.</P>

<P>How can you talk so, Floretta? I won't tho', and none of them shall make me; they all frightened me, by saying it was a bad thing not to obey my parents, and so I con∣sented to marry this Quaker-man; but there's a wide dif∣ference between marrying him and forgetting Lubin.</P>

<P>Speak freely.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why there's a covetous old hunks, and, like your Wor∣ship, that because he is rich, would fain take away a young woman that I was to be married to, without her consent or mine.</P>

<P>And why, I pray thee?</P>

<P>Because, as I take it, if any body gives a thing, 'tis not their's any lorger; and they gave me their consent long ago.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>STEADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou speakest the truth, but what wouldst thou have me to do in this business?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, please you, Sir, I have often heard it said of your Worship, that there were three things you'd never suffer in our village, if you could help it—The maidens to go without sweethearts—the industrious without reward—and the injured without redress—and to be sure it made me think, that if you were once acquainted with the rights of this affair, you would not suffer it to go on; for, says I, set in case it was his Worship's own concern, how would he like to have the young woman taken away from him, that he is going to marry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>STEADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>There thou saidst it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LUBIN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes, I thought that was bringing the case Lome.</P>

<P>Friends and neighbours, it hath been my study since I first came among you, to do whatever might procure me your love and esteem.

I will now propose to you a question, to see which of you can make

'Tis an old saying, That 'tis as precious as gold; and yet we are always throwing it away. And your Worship, as a proof that nothing can be done without it, if the old gentleman we were talking about to-day, had not had the opportunity of my absence, he could not have run away with a certain young damsel.</P>
