<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE author of this short Tour in Holland, had not an idea of submitting his remarks in that country to the publick, at the time they were made—The careless and irregular manner in which it is written will fully evince this truth.—However, as several of his friends importuned him to pub∣lish it, in its original native state, he has assented; having previously solicited the can∣did criticism of the celebrated author of <HI>M'Fingal,</HI> from whose letter on this subject the author has made free to extract the fol∣lowing remarks, viz.</P>
<P>"IN America we know little of Hol∣land—nor do I believe the English in gen∣eral
<PB N="vi" REF="023039_0003_0FBB744DDDCF2250"/>
know much more. The nobility and gentry, who take the tour of Europe, seldom visit the Netherlands, and the remarks of English travellers, which I have seen, seem not to extend beyond the city of Amsterdam.</P>
<P>"THE best account of the Dutch manners I have met with, is contained in the <HI>Adele and Theodore</HI> of the countess <HI>de Genlis,</HI> who occasionally paints the manners in some of their towns, particularly in Broeck, Sar∣dan, &amp;c. in perfect conformity to your de∣scriptions.</P>
<P>"THE constitution of the United Nether∣lands has been attended to by writers on gov∣ernment; but an accurate account of trav∣els in that nation, describing the face of the country, and the manners of the inhabitants, is, so far as my reading extends, as yet un∣supplied in English, as well as American literature. I am of opinion that your essay will supply it, as far as can be expected
<PB N="vii" REF="023039_0004_0FBB7450CE752C00"/>
from so short a tour through the principal cities.</P>
<P>"I AM pleased with your descriptions, your sentiments, and your general manner of expressing them, and must thank you for the valuable information I have received from them, of the country and manners of the Dutch.</P>
<P>"YOUR style may be criticised by illna∣tured, scholastick pedants, but will not be blamed with any severity by others. An easy, lively, familiar style, approaching even to carelessness, is best suited to a work of this kind, and will give more pleasure to read∣ers in general, than the laborious stiffness and pedantry of <HI>Johnson,</HI> or the florid ele∣gance of <HI>Gibbon.</HI> Let <HI>mere scholars</HI> pay more attention to words than things, and be praised by <HI>mere scholars,</HI> for their skill in arranging them like soldiers on the parade, and marching them off properly by divisions—
<PB N="viii" REF="023039_0005_0FBB7451B8B9D5D8"/>
This is not the chief business of those who write to instruct, entertain and be under∣stood.</P>
<P>"IN many passages, which I have passed over, I should have suggested some little al∣teration, if I could have had the pleasure of seeing you. But as they would have requir∣ed a change of a sentence, I could not alter them without changing the colour of the style, and often destroying its genuine <HI>naïveté.</HI> However, I think you may safely leave them as they are, for the small criticks to nibble upon; for as <HI>they</HI> are the proper domesticks in the literary family, it is but just that their masters should give them some crumbs for their subsistence."</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR BROTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">E</SEG>XPERIENCE every day convinces me, that no situation in life is more disgusting to an active mind, than to have noth∣ing to do.—The pres∣ent moment seems a vacuum in my existence; at night I look back with re∣gret
<PB N="10" REF="023039_0007_0FBB9EB71E2E2688"/>
to find the best hours of my life mouldering away in the cause of in∣dolence.</P>
<P>THE mind of man must rest on some pursuit, or he will drift among the rocks of dissipation.</P>
<P>THE only hours in which I can rel∣ish any satisfaction, are those I pass in the country; but my affairs often call me to this vast metropolis, which to me is the most soul sinking place I ever was in; and, in truth, the last retreat for an American to enjoy that social pleas∣ure, neighbourly intercourse, and cor∣dial friendship, which constitute so large a proportion of our happiness.</P>
<P>EVERY family here are wrapt up with∣in themselves, and measure their neigh∣bour's merit by his purse and equipage: In short, the whole city is a great gulph
<PB N="11" REF="023039_0008_0FBB9EBD578DA1F0"/>
of riches and vice, and every particle of air seems impregnated with corruption: Indeed I find there is no happiness equal to that which results from virtue, tem∣perance and industry. The more I see of mankind, the more I am convinced of this truth, and the less reconciled to their vanities and follies. Do not sup∣pose that I have been posting about up∣on the globe for nearly ten years togeth∣er, and am at last divested of those liber∣al ideas I have endeavoured to cherish— No! I have leisurely traversed old Eng∣land in almost every direction, and, di∣vested of prejudice, I am ready to allow it the full weight of its merit: Take the kingdom all in all, I am persuaded there is no country which has a better claim to decisive bravery, and improvements in agriculture and the arts; but we have found the important mystery of being much happier than the English, which may perhaps be imputed to a great
<PB N="12" REF="023039_0009_0FBB9EBE651BF060"/>
depravity of their morals, as it seems generally confessed that their former en∣vied national character no more exists, and that we now inherit in Neweng∣land those masculine virtues which dis∣tinguished them so conspicuously in the last century.</P>
<P>HEAVEN defend our posterity from the same degeneracy! If the consequence is no less than the loss of their happiness, how much ought we to exert ourselves to preserve and perpetuate, our sim∣plicity of manners, in their native pu∣rity?</P>
<P>I HAVE almost run through my let∣ter without telling you the only thing I meant to say at first; which was, that I am just on the wing for Holland, without any view of business; but as I absolutely begin to rust for want of activity, I mean to rub myself a little
<PB N="13" REF="023039_0010_0FBB9EC02C384C18"/>
bright among the Mynheers and Mav∣rows. I have hunted over half the book∣stores in this city for some good descrip∣tion of that artificial country, but, to my astonishment, I cannot find any suf∣ficiently accurate, either to furnish just ideas, or to satisfy my curiosity—and as I know we have but little better know∣ledge of Holland in America, than of O∣taheite, I will endeavour to make such remarks as will at least impress the ob∣jects on my own mind, and perhaps a∣muse some of my American friends. Linked as we are in our political con∣nexion with Holland, our ignorance on this head is much to be lamented.— Adieu!</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>HARWICH, <DATE>26th May, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>JOURNAL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FIVE o'clock this morning left the King's Arms Inn, on my way to Harwich, with several jovial compan∣ions, bound to Holland.</P>
<P>THE morning was serene, with a clear blue sky, and the air sweetly per∣fumed.</P>
<P>THE country from London to Har∣wich is all in the county of Essex, and finely cultivated. We passed through several considerable villages, and by many elegant seats. Essex is celebrated for grain and cattle. We breakfasted at Inger∣stole,
<PB N="15" REF="023039_0012_0FBB9EC2F0FFA7C8"/>
twenty three miles from London, and passed the time so merrily to Col∣chester, fifty two miles, that we were hardly sensible of the ground or time we measured.</P>
<P>COLCHESTER is a large town, built principally upon a pleasant, healthy eminence, and celebrated for good oy∣sters. The streets are clean, and the houses all white; but the pavements rough. Our landlord tells us, they count sixteen parishes, and fourteen thousand inhabitants, who carry on largely in the manufactory of flannels and baizes, known by the name of Col∣chester baizes.</P>
<P>IN eight or nine miles from this town we arrived on the borders of the Stour, or tide river, and found the country exceedingly romantick and agreeable until we reached Harwich.
<PB N="16" REF="023039_0013_0FBB9EC4844B6938"/>
In the neighbourhood of this place we passed the superb seat of Richard Rigby, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> upon our right, and a seventy four gun ship on the stocks, on our left; immediately after which, from the summit of a hill, the German ocean suddenly opened to our view.</P>
<P>HARWICH is a villanous dirty little hole, but the Packet being ready to weigh anchor, we were speedily reliev∣ed from the impositions to which stran∣gers are ever subject in such places.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>HELVOETSLUYS, <DATE>27th May, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will readily acknow∣ledge my punctuality, when I assure you, that I arrived here but a few hours since, and have already assumed my pen to give you an account of a country I have hardly yet set foot into; but as the first impression is always the most forcible, when one is plunged as it were into a new region of phizes and fashions, where art and nature both assume a different aspect, I shall endeavour to follow the current of my feelings from the mo∣ment we set sail from Harwich, to the
<PB N="18" REF="023039_0015_0FBB9ECA35561550"/>
present; after which, you may expect a more detailed account, as I become more thoroughly acquainted; for I will freely confess my total ignorance both of the nation, and the geography of the coun∣try. To paint the contrast of objects in strong colours admits of no delay, for once familiarized with them—the novel∣ty ceases. Before I proceed I must vent my spleen against the villanous search officers at Harwich, who extorted money from each of us for doing what they are paid for. I contended in vain to oppose their injustice, but was reluctant∣ly forced to bend to the rod, or submit to delay and inconvenience. We weigh∣ed anchor on board the Prince of Wales, Capt. Hearn, at seven o'clock in the evening, and stood along the Suffolk coast to the northward, to avoid some shoals, and then hauled E. S. E. I wished much to remain on deck all the evening, but the atmosphere was wild, and heav∣ily
<PB N="19" REF="023039_0016_0FBB9ECDC7F57DA8"/>
charged with hanging clouds; which were so uncivil as to sift their waters upon us, and oblige us to decamp be∣low; where we immediately stowed our∣selves away in snug little cabins, which are particularly neat and commodious; indeed I have never seen any packet al∣together so neat. We had a squally thundering night, but I was safe wrap∣ped up in the arms of sleep until four o'clock this morning.—The morning's sun soon frightened away the sea exhala∣tions, which left to our view several ves∣sels in the offing. Our vessel had scarcely any motion, as the sea was only dimpled by a light breeze, which wafted us gradually towards the Low Dutch coast in the afternoon; which we saw nothing off until close aboard of it; owing to a mist, and a flat country.</P>
<P>WE sailed along the Zealand coast upon our right, where windmills, light∣houses,
<PB N="20" REF="023039_0017_0FBB9ECEE361D898"/>
rows of trees, and distant spires were continually rising to our view. The breeze quickened up, and pushed us rapidly forward to the pier of Helvoet∣sluys, where we doubled briskly round, and in an instant entered between two long piers stretching out in the harbour, with the town directly before us. The piers were both lined with curious specta∣tors.—The first object that fixed my at∣tention, was a smoking Dutchman, which marked the characteristick of the nation so far. In this moment I felt such a spirit of universal philanthropy possess my soul, that I could most cordially have given him a friendly shake of brotherly love; this convinced me, how much our happiness in this world depends on those social bonds which ought to link us all together.</P>
<P>TO return—The pier is built of strong piles of timber one hundred and forty
<PB N="21" REF="023039_0018_0FBB9ED0A29272D8"/>
feet in length, and sunk thirty feet in the mud; an immense work indeed, which seems to bid defiance to the impetuosity of the waves. We found several ships in the harbour, and the quay and streets well paved with small Dutch clinkers, or bricks, as hard as stone, and placed edge∣ways. In the bason above the town, we also saw several men of war, and some skeletons, said to be the remains of the ships commanded by the famous Van Tromp, when he defeated the English. Helvoetsluys is situated upon the west side of the Isle of Voorn in the Province of Holland. It is small, but well for∣tified, and neat in the extreme, as the clinkers are washed as clean as hounds teeth.</P>
<P>IN truth, the houses, dress, and every thing around us, wore the face of that neatness so peculiar to this singular na∣tion and country. The sudden change
<PB N="22" REF="023039_0019_0FBB9ED2FB452438"/>
of every object, had such an effect on me, the first moment we entered this town, that I was almost inclined to imagine myself let off in an air balloon, or lost in the moon, or some other region to∣tally new and strange. We examined carefully every object worth notice, and and were much amused with the singu∣larity of the houses, many of which are built in the old Spanish manner; so that the attick story is quite lost in a narrow peek. The men and women in the vulgar class, are quite boorish and inanimate, and appear characteristick with their ships—heavy and <HI>square.</HI>—</P>
<P>THE women are singularly dressed; we have not yet seen a single head elevated beyond the bounds nature has prescribed; but they are all trussed up with caps as tight as their skins; add to this, com∣mon brass ear rings of an enormous size; and as a proof of their taste, what
<PB N="23" REF="023039_0020_0FBB9ED44C228D58"/>
should you think of black beauty spots over their temples, as big as a crown, and as ragged as if torn from the silk?</P>
<P>I AM quite in raptures with the neat∣ness which dazzles our eyes on all sides; but as my head is not yet totally free from the dizziness of our sea passage, I shall not venture any farther to night; but will reserve my other observations for future letters, which you may regu∣larly expect from post to post, until I have nothing new to say, or otherwise until my return to England.</P>
<P>WE have now in company a young Oxonian, just <HI>fledged,</HI> and for the first time adrift in the wide world, upon the <HI>grand tour</HI>: I left him an hour since, industrious∣ly engaged in writing his journal in a back room, with his travelling desk, and a va∣riety of instruments paraded before him— Were I a Dutchman, I should have sus∣pected
<PB N="24" REF="023039_0021_0FBB9ED602DAF8E8"/>
him for a spy, and stealing a plan of the fortifications: But how unjust my suspicions would have been! for I peeped slyly over his shoulder, and found him innocently engaged in drawing a Dutch wench scrubbing the pavements—as the first specimen of his genius and sagacity— if father Sterne had been in my place he would certainly have ranked him in the class of "simple travellers."—It is a chance if your eyes are not fatigued by this time; I am sure my fingers are, so I shall leave you abruptly, as I feel myself entirely disposed to try the good qualities of a Dutch bed.</P>
<P>MY compliments wait on your ami∣able family, and believe me very respect∣fully,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your devoted humble Servant, — —.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<OPENER><DATELINE>ROTTERDAM, <DATE>29th May, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I PROMISED to continue my observations, but so many new objects have crowded upon me since my last, that I am really at a loss where to seize the chain, so as to run along from link to link, in some regular order to the end of the sheet.</P>
<P>WE left Helvoetsluys yesterday morn∣ing, at seven o'clock, in a villanous coach drawn by two horses across the Island of Voorn, to the pleasant town of Brill, situated on the east side of the Island.
<PB N="26" REF="023039_0023_0FBB9EDD9E0E07E0"/>
We found the roads muddy and disa∣greeable, and nothing which merits par∣ticular notice in the country, except that their cows horns are shorter than those in England—the sheep have none at all —and if we can judge from the appear∣ance of the women, the husbands are in no <HI>great danger</HI> of wearing horns any more than the sheep—at least not longer than the cows.</P>
<P>WE observed upon almost every church, as well as in the very heart of the Brill, enormous great storks nests—these birds enjoy the patronage and protection of the States, we are told, from some re∣ligious prejudice—and from a notion that they are partial to Republicks. Swans are called imperial birds, as none but the nobility can keep them.</P>
<P>SEVEN miles travelling brought us to the Brill; however, I will say nothing
<PB N="27" REF="023039_0024_0FBB9EDEAA645F08"/>
of this snug town, until I have told you how we were fleeced by the porters be∣fore we set off; and what is worse, they are countenanced by the police: The truth is, we could not prevail on our lubberly, smoking mule of a driver, to bring his coach to our door to receive our baggage, though in the same street, and only half a dozen doors distant; but we must employ porters. After much puzzle about nothing, we put all our baggage into one waggon, and mounted six of us in another, and jogged away through the mud. It is very curious to see how these fellows steer their fore wheels with their feet. In approaching Brill, we passed under a double grove of beautiful trees, a long draw bridge, lead∣ing over a wide fosse; and then entered through the gates, and aversed the best part of the city; while the skippers were settling by the dice, which should
<PB N="28" REF="023039_0025_0FBB9EE0279B30D0"/>
take us up to Rotterdam. This place is celebrated in history for giving birth to the Republick. It was here the male-contents planted their standard under the Earl of March, in 1572, from on board some privateers (two hundred and three years before the Lexington battle, which also gave birth to the American Republick) and in spite of every effort made by the bloody Duke d'Alva, (who was then prosecuting the horrid inquisi∣tion with barbarous rigour) they held possession. The sparks of a revolt were thickly scattered, and only waited a fa∣vourable breeze to blow up the flame, spreading in an instant throughout the seventeen Provinces, which were soon after supported by the great Prince Wil∣liam the first, at this time levying forces in Germany, to rescue his country from the cruel hands of their biggoted, Span∣ish persecutors.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="023039_0026_0FBB9EE1ECDEDCB8"/>WE found every object upon a larg∣er scale at Brill, than at the Helvoet∣sluys.</P>
<P>LET a man have travelled in every oth∣er quarter of the globe, still here he would have found the charm of novelty.—A certain whim and elegance mark their old houses, which cannot be easily de∣scribed, but must be seen, in order to be properly conceived of.</P>
<P>THE streets are spacious, and all plant∣ed with trees upon each side of the canals, which run along in the middle: The verdure of the trees reflecting strongly upon large windows which are kept bright and free from dust, add infinitely to their lustre and magnificence.</P>
<P>IT had an odd appearance to us, to see reflecting glasses hitched upon the outside of the most genteel windows, so that Mad∣am
<PB N="30" REF="023039_0027_0FBB9EE5B668A278"/>
(Mavrow) can set unobserved by her window and reconnoitre at her ease every object passing up and down the streets.</P>
<P>IN this town it seemed as if the on∣ly or chief business was scrubbing and scouring on all sides. The church is a handsome structure, the steeple of which is the sailors land mark. Ships sailing up the Maes to Rotterdam, pass close under the ramparts of this city, upon which are pleasant walks under groves of trees.</P>
<P>THE isle of Voorn, of which Brill is the capital, is about twenty miles in length, and six in breadth; the soil ap∣peared to us light, but fruitful in grain.</P>
<P>UPON our return, we found our vessel ready to set sail, and with a fine fresh gale at N. W. we immediately entered the
<PB N="31" REF="023039_0028_0FBB9EE89D208718"/>
Maes, and stood away directly before it for Rotterdam.</P>
<P>THE river is one mile and a half broad opposite to Brill; but in general a mile.</P>
<P>UPON the borders, are many groves, as well as rows of trees, and several villag∣es; particularly Delfthaven, two miles from Rotterdam, and rendered famous for having produced the gallant Van Tromp—the pride of Holland; who, notwithstanding his persevering valour, never succeeded to any decided effect. This village is strongly fortified, and de∣fended against inundations by dams. We saw three men of war, and several ships in the harbour as we passed. The willow trees along the margin of the river ap∣peared afloat in the water at a little dis∣tance; indeed the country is so flat and low, that we had nothing in our way but trees to intercept our view, which we
<PB N="32" REF="023039_0029_0FBB9EEA3B409FF8"/>
overlooked mostly from our deck. The meadows and pasture lands afford fine feeding for cattle, who stand up to their eyes in rich clover. The skip∣per told us that the water is from four to five fathoms deep in many parts of the river; but no vessel exceeding nine or ten feet attempts to come up the Maes by Brill, and that the heavy ships go round by Helvoetsluys and Dordrecht.</P>
<P>IN the neighbourhood of Rotterdam, we passed several groves of trees upon our right; and then sailed along parallel with the bomb quay, half a mile, where we saw a lovely line of trees closely knit together, which <HI>half</HI> deprived us of the sight of the most magnificent houses I can recollect to have seen any where. The old skipper told us, that the walks under these trees were truly elegant, and much frequented by the <HI>beau
<PB N="33" REF="023039_0030_0FBB9EEB93311600"/>
monde</HI>—we found them broad, with dis∣tinct walks finely shaded.</P>
<P>WE penetrated with our eyes into the heart of this beautiful city, through two or three avenues as we passed; which shewed us such a singular confusion of masts, spires, trees, canals, and houses, all jumbled together, as led me almost to think that nature and art had planned this enchanting compound in a whimsi∣cal moment.</P>
<P>ROTTERDAM is the second grand em∣porium of the Republick—the harbour is safe from naval enemies, but inconve∣nient of access, on account of its distance from the sea.</P>
<P>THE port is rendered particularly commodious, by large canals, which ad∣mit ships of upwards of three hundred
<PB N="34" REF="023039_0031_0FBB9EECFB15D6D8"/>
tons burden, quite up to the merchants doors in every part of the city.</P>
<P>OPPOSITE to the bomb quay the great∣est part of the shipping are moored, which has a noble effect, much enlivened by the motion of ships and boats sailing up and down the river.</P>
<P>THE town is very populous, and built in a triangular form; the houses most∣ly very large and elegant, made of flat ground brick, neatly pointed with white seams—and the streets are spacious and well paved by the sides of the canals.</P>
<P>TO avoid a repetition on this head, I will endeavour to give you a general idea at once of the principal cities in Holland. Imagine yourself traversing one of these cities, and every other mo∣ment upon a neat draw bridge (built with hewn stone and iron railings) lead∣ing
<PB N="35" REF="023039_0032_0FBB9EEE81885968"/>
over a canal running through a spa∣cious street, with a continual commo∣tion of boats and barges upon each side —a clean paved wide street before you, and beautiful houses, with trees border∣ing the canals. Hold fast to these grand outlines, and suppose yourself immerged in a crowd of industrious mortals, all in pursuit of wealth, and you can easily trace, by your fire side, most of the towns in the Seven Provinces.</P>
<P>I MUST not forget to tell you, that we walked in a pleasant grove just with∣out the gates, where we saw many of the gentry upon the wing for their coun∣try seats, with good black horses, and clumsy carriages—some of them capri∣ciously made in form of triumphant cars —The Dutch gentlemen seldom ride on horseback, and never without being ex∣posed to the ridicule of the rabble at such an uncommon sight.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="023039_0033_0FBB9EEFE8B98D68"/>WE were often puzzled in the streets for an interpreter, but seldom failed in addressing ourselves in French to any people of genteel appearance. It is re∣ally astonishing how generally this lan∣guage is now spoken throughout Eu∣rope. Indeed it is almost vulgar for a man to speak his native tongue with the <HI>beau monde</HI>—and a knowledge of the French is an indispensable criterion of an accomplished gentleman; for a foreigner is always addressed in this popular and charming language.</P>
<P>SINCE I am upon the subject of lan∣guages, a few words in defence of the Dutch will not be improper. Every one knows it is in truth vulgar and harsh; but perhaps no two languages bear a greater affinity to each other than the Dutch and the English.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="023039_0034_0FBB9EF1A63CB628"/>WHEN I first arrived in France, it was some weeks before I could understand a collected French phrase; but the mo∣ment I landed in Holland, I heard entire English phrases, or rather such as the English borrowed from the Dutch; for it is well known, that the Dutch is an original language, and the English, on the contrary, a compounded one; besides, in examining a Dutch letter, I found it contained so many English words and phrases, that I had no difficulty to un∣derstand the greatest part of it. It therefore ill becomes the English to rid∣icule a language so much like their own.</P>
<P>WE saw near the market place the stat∣ue of the famous Erasmus, who was born here; and viewed St. Lawrence, the principal Church—where we ascended a lofty tower, from whence we command∣ed a delightful picturesque <HI>coup d'oeil.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="023039_0035_0FBB9EF53784EBD0"/>THE city of Rotterdam appeared like a high finished curious picture below us; and the country beyond, a delightful back ground, cultivated like a continued garden, all the way to our horizon.</P>
<P>I HAVE not yet, in any instance, ex∣perienced a more happy hour than in contemplating this wonderful country, which seems like an enchanted fairy land.</P>
<P>IN ranging over this extended pros∣pect, we encompassed within our view, through spyglasses, Delft, Dort, Hague, Brill, Utrecht, and Amsterdam; which in fact included the best part of Hol∣land.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT it beyond the power of the most fertile conception to imagine a more lovely sight; but I found this large picture much improved by reduc∣ing
<PB N="39" REF="023039_0036_0FBB9EF89AEFB4C8"/>
it to miniature by a concave mirror, which we luckily had with us.</P>
<P>THIS country never fails to strike even Europeans (acquainted with high cultiva∣tion) with wonder and admiration; but the effect is yet more powerful upon an American, who has been accustomed from his infancy to a country of na∣ture, laid out upon a large and copious scale: This, on the contrary, is a coun∣try of art, as it were, wrested from the sea, which necessarily produces as great a contrast in objects as can be well con∣ceived.</P>
<P>I AM terrified with the length of this letter: Should it afford you any amuse∣ment adequate to the postage and troub∣le in reading it, my wishes will be fully gratified.—Adieu!</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>ROTTERDAM, <DATE>30th May, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALL nature seems to smile this delightful morn.</P>
<P>WE have just made a little excursion into the country, roving carelessly a∣mong the yellow bosomed meadows, the fragrancy of which was a luxury I wish to participate in common with my friends.</P>
<P>WE shall go on glutting our greedy eyes until the afternoon, when we intend pursuing our travels on to the Hague.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="023039_0038_0FBB9EFB32178838"/>I MUST not, however, leave Rotter∣dam without making my obeisance to our thirteen American stripes, which are flying among the shipping. You know I am particularly partial to them. Not∣withstanding their youth, they are for∣ward in introducing themselves into the company of old European streamers, which have been waving on the ocean until they begin to fade with age: But the <HI>Stripes</HI> shine with the lustre of a rainbow, after a thunder storm—which, happily for mankind, is blown over— and has left the world in a dead calm.</P>
<P>IN addition to the American ships in this harbour, we saw several large Dutch∣men, freighted to carry over to America upwards of one thousand emigrants.</P>
<P>WHAT a feast for the soul, when we reflect that the present age in America has, by a virtuous and arduous struggle,
<PB N="42" REF="023039_0039_0FBB9EFCCB2F1920"/>
opened an asylum to the oppressed na∣tions of the earth: This consideration alone (when we reflect on its extended effects, and probable duration) is worth all the dangers and toils we have en∣dured in the conflict.</P>
<P>SINCE the world first existed, no peo∣ple ever had a more solemn, and import∣ant charge committed to their hands; as the welfare of millions, for ages to come, rests on the persevering virtue of the present generation.</P>
<P>AMERICA stands comparatively like the sun in the heavens—the centre of light, and the wonder of the admiring world, who feel the influence of its rays.</P>
<P>THE persecuted will find ease and rest; and tortured virtue and exiled worth will take refuge among us, from every quar∣ter of this old world.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="023039_0040_0FBB9F0280D54990"/>MILD laws, executed with energy, will secure us happiness, and bid astonished probity defy its tyrant.</P>
<P>I PRAY God, that this infant fabrick may never be shattered by the clashing interests of the different States; and that they may continue their glorious career, and nobly sacrifice partial views to the general good of the common empire.</P>
<P>THERE is something so exceedingly musical in the Dutch chimes, that I oft∣en stop in the middle of a street to listen to their shrill sounds: The bells hang, in great numbers, in niches round the towers of the churches.</P>
<P>IN the church of St. Lawrence we saw a grave, where bones, and some old Dutch skulls were sticking out at the sides, ap∣parently eager once more to catch the light: The old Sexton was busily em∣ployed
<PB N="44" REF="023039_0041_0FBB9F051446D390"/>
in collecting the bones, and pack∣ing them up in separate boxes, of about three feet square, to be reinterred in this compact way, which I find is a custom.</P>
<P>OUR Oxonian companion took off a curious Latin Epitaph from a monu∣ment, of which he gave me this transla∣tion in English:</P>
<P>JOHN BRAAKEL, THE TERROUR OF THE SEA, TO WHOM FIRE, EARTH, AND WATER SUBMITTED, IS COVERED WITH THIS STONE. HIS SPIRIT EVEN NOW SEEMS READY TO BURST INTO FLAME, AND TO BREAK FROM ITS EARTHLY HABITATION, AS HE BROKE THE CHAINS OF IRON.</P>
<P>I WAS much pleased with these bold thoughts; and upon examining the his∣tory
<PB N="45" REF="023039_0042_0FBB9F0661701AB8"/>
of the United Provinces, I find Braa∣kel was a Dutch Admiral from Haerlem, who distinguished himself in a memora∣ble exploit in the holy war, in 1245.</P>
<P>WHEN the combined armies arrived in Egypt, the passage of the Nile was inter∣cepted by an extraordinary iron chain, which Braakel found means to break, by the aid of enormous iron saws fixed on the stern of three of his ships; the in∣vention succeeded, and Damietta was in consequence taken: The idea was sug∣gested by a Haerlem boy, since which the city arms are, a sword between four stars, and a cross over the point, with this motto: "VALOUR OVERCOMES POWER."</P>
<P>AS an American, I feel myself deeply impressed with the superior dignity of my country. Not from its present wealth or
<PB N="46" REF="023039_0043_0FBB9F07E67E2810"/>
numbers, nor from those selfish and nar∣row principles which lead most English∣men to view themselves and their coun∣try superior to the rest of the world; but from the happy situation of America— its natural advantages—and indulging in the copious field of anticipation.</P>
<P>IN February, 1778, I found myself in the south part of Georgia, and the trees in full bloom, with every pleasing aspect of spring.</P>
<P>FROM February to May, I continued edging northerly as far as the borders of Newhampshire, carrying with me for upwards of 1200 miles the same climate and fragrancy.</P>
<P>IN this tour, I crossed eighteen noble rivers, and travelled over every species of soil, blessed with such a diversity of cli∣mates
<PB N="47" REF="023039_0044_0FBB9F0962A35328"/>
as to render it susceptible of all the productions the earth affords.</P>
<P>ENGLAND, France, and many other parts of Europe, after a succession of ages, for some thousand years, have at length arrived to the highest stage of im∣provements both in agriculture and the arts: Two centuries however have hard∣ly elapsed since America was a mere haunt for savages, and for animals; and yet we find her already advanced to the intermediate stage between a state of wild nature and the improved state of Europe.</P>
<P>HOLLAND is a perfect garden; but a continued sameness presents no new ob∣ject for the imagination to rest upon.</P>
<P>ENGLAND and France are more diver∣sified and romantick, and in general richly cultivated—here and there an ar∣tificial forest—venerable castles—majes∣tick
<PB N="48" REF="023039_0045_0FBB9F0E45E37DF8"/>
country seats—large populous in land cities—charming roads; and many other interesting objects, to engage the partic∣ular attention of an American: But when we leave these objects, the effects of art, and enter upon the broad scale of nature, we shall find her in miniature on this side of the Atlantick, in comparison to the vast lakes and rivers, bold har∣bours, majestick trees, and mountains of America, where the face of the country is pleasingly chequered with high culti∣vation, and nature in its bold and orig∣inal state.</P>
<P>VIEWING America from its first dis∣covery to the present period, and then carrying our ideas forward one hundred years, we may safely presume upon as many millions of inhabitants, all cir∣cumstances considered; with wealth and improvements in proportion.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="023039_0046_0FBB9F10264E2AE8"/>SINCE no reason therefore can be as∣signed why America will not continue its career with the same wonderful progress for the next hundred years, an Amer∣ican may justly glory in his country, without falling under the imputation of national prejudice.</P>
<P>FRANCE may boast of her Loire, and England of her Thames; but how many such and superior rivers may not an A∣merican boast of? Besides, America is so curiously intersected with inland water communications, that the connexion be∣tween the lakes and rivers, spread over an immense region, may be compared (at least on a map) to the veins and arteries of the human body.</P>
<P>WHEN we contemplate a young em∣pire, blessed with such singular advan∣tages, unconnected from its situation with the entangled politicks of Europe,
<PB N="50" REF="023039_0047_0FBB9F12080D7278"/>
enjoying the freest local governments on earth, and inhabited by a brave and en∣terprising people, scattered over a great continent; I know of no limits we can fix to our anticipations, in respect to her future power, wealth, and every other perfection which can dignify human na∣ture; especially should the enlightened citizens of America be so peculiarly for∣tunate as to be blessed with a just and virtuous government, which will draw all their views and interests under one com∣pact head, fairly represented from the pure and uncorrupted body of the people. Yours, &amp;c.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>On board the —, on the Delft Canal, <DATE>6 o'clock, 30th May.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HERE we go! in a floating house sixty feet long and six wide.</P>
<P>I AM now seated in what is called the roof or cabin, which is very agreeable, being calculated to hold conveniently eight or ten persons, who can secure it to themselves by paying a small matter extra. This cabin has a table in the middle, two sash windows, and a bench with velvet cushions on each side.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="023039_0049_0FBB9F14A8CD5BB8"/>THE rest of the boat is covered with a flat roof, strewed over with small shells cemented in tar, upon which passengers may walk with perfect safety: Under the platform, or roof, the common passengers are seated; twenty eight is the full com∣plement, as stipulated by the police.</P>
<P>I HAVE just been upon deck, and wish now to introduce you into our compa∣ny by as concise a description of the country, and manner of travelling, as my pen will allow me to give you.</P>
<P>IN the first place, we jumped on board just without the gates of Rotterdam, and were then put in motion, by a single horse, trotting along upon the edge of the canal, with thirty of us in tow. In this manner they travel three miles an hour. In this progress they are so exact, that the Dutch manner of computing distan∣ces from place to place, is by hours in∣stead of miles.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="023039_0050_0FBB9F165757F3C0"/>LOTH to lose a single object, we parad∣ed upon the top of the house, with a crowded room under us, and clouds of tobacco smoke issuing out from little win∣dows on each side—with a full view of the country all around—being entirely flat and no obstacle to impede the sight. In this manner we are now travelling:— But I am sure you will not forgive me to leave you on the top of the boat, and say nothing of the country, and a pleas∣ing variety besides.</P>
<P>ON one side of the canal, near Rotter∣dam, we passed a pleasant row of trees, alive with carriages and people, as well as the canal with these cloudy boats full of passengers, and loaded lighters.</P>
<P>YOU will naturally suppose that such a perpetual movement, with a chain of draw bridges, leading over the canals, must necessarily produce confusion.—
<PB N="54" REF="023039_0051_0FBB9F18F10B05F0"/>
<HI>Point du tout!</HI> You would be surprised to see with what dexterity, they avoid each other, and pass under the bridges. All boats going one way are obliged to drop the rope by which they are dragged until the others pass. Thus the progress of neither is retarded.</P>
<P>THE season is all in our favour, and nature in full dress. The weather as fine as we could wish, and our prospect on all sides animated by a charming variety.</P>
<P>YOU must know that most of the gen∣teel people reside the best part of the summer at their country houses; many of which are superb to a high degree; the others are very neat, and all situated near the borders of some canal, with a little pleasant summer house exactly up∣on the margin. These houses are in a manner <HI>all windows,</HI> and many <HI>á la Chi∣noise</HI>—the gardens are mere pictures—
<PB N="55" REF="023039_0052_0FBB9F1AE58B63A0"/>
the Dutch however seem too much at∣tached to a profusion of evergreens, and box; many of their pleasure houses are covered with them, and we often see them formed into grottos, arches, and a variety of pleasing and whimsical forms.</P>
<P>THE fragrancy of the meadows and flower gardens, heightens exceedingly this agreeable manner of travelling in Hol∣land, in a fine summer's day, which we now enjoy; and from the top of our floating house we have a fair peep into their pleasure houses; where we see the happy citizens, regaling themselves in parties, drinking tea, smoking, playing cards, hearing musick, or reading occa∣sionally. I almost envied them their happiness; but have got myself between two fires, and must leave you until we pass Delft, or else I shall be suffocated under a heavy cloud—two old Dutch∣men are puffing up at my elbows.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="023039_0053_0FBB9F1D786BAA20"/>IT is very singular I cannot suffer a pipe on water; but on <HI>terra firma</HI> I can range myself comfortably in a battalion of smokers.—Adieu! for a moment.</P>
<P>P. S. WE are now drawing fast to the city of Delft—my next will be from the Hague.—Adieu! again.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER VII.</HI> To the same.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>HAGUE, <DATE>31st May, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now to give you an ac∣count of occurrences since I left you in a tobacco cloud, on the Delft canal.</P>
<P>I AM always fond of mixing with peo∣ple in every situation, when I am trav∣elling; otherwise we might as well stay at home. The only true way to study the human passions, and the grand spring which actuates the bulk of mankind, is to analyze them in various positions; and by a disposition to be affable, every one may easily induce a conversation:—
<PB N="58" REF="023039_0055_0FBB9F20A8677D98"/>
If he gain nothing by the bargain, it is his own fault if he lose.</P>
<P>IN this frame of mind, I crawled into the body of the boat, and fortunately filled a vacant seat by the side of a <HI>belle Bruxellois tout á faite à la François,</HI> with her Monsieur upon her left.—I found no difficulty to introduce a <HI>badinage</HI> the first moment I was seated; and in the next, with all the wanton assurance of a Newenglandman, to ask her, from whence she came? where she resided? and if the gentleman by her side was her husband, gallant, or brother? She, with all the good nature of a true Frenchwoman, as readily gratified my curiosity. By the time we drew near Delft, our acquaint∣ance was refined into the true style of <HI>sans souce,</HI> and it seemed to me as if it was of a month's standing at least—how, or by what singular agency it happened, I know not; but our hands were soon locked in
<PB N="59" REF="023039_0056_0FBB9F23128E07D0"/>
one—and I began to conceit that I felt myself sensibly interested in her happi∣ness.</P>
<P>HER husband was busily engaged in reading, and gave himself no anxiety about us.—Custom has in France estab∣lished a certain <HI>innocent</HI> ladies' language —which in England would be construed into a decided intrigue.</P>
<P>IN leaving the trukschute at Delft, Monsieur politely resigned up Madame to my care, and trudged on before— We linked arms, and trod over the pave∣ments as lightly as a young couple on the full march to the shrine of Hymen— Every moment in this crisis of our ap∣proaching separation, mutually interested us in each other's welfare—and while we were walking the streets of Delft, Mad∣ame slipt her address at Rotterdam into my hand—where I pledged myself to
<PB N="60" REF="023039_0057_0FBB9F247AF381C8"/>
pay her my respects on my return from Amsterdam.—By this time we came up to the house of her destination—and I thought I could read more meaning in her brilliant black eyes in the final adieu! than in all she had said—thus we part∣ed. She made a transfer of her polite∣ness to Monsieur; with him I rejoined my comrades, and then viewed every thing of note in this large city.</P>
<P>DELFT is a pleasant and elegant place, situated thirty one miles south west from Amsterdam, in the province of Holland, containing about five thousand houses and twenty thousand inhabitants. It is of an oblong figure, and well defended from enemies and the sea, by an old wall and three dams. The inhabitants are principally people who have retired upon their fortunes. The streets are conse∣quently exceedingly neat, and free from the noise and bustle of trade.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="023039_0058_0FBB9F278EBF3CF0"/>THE stadthouse is a handsome old Gothick structure, in which are many good paintings; but the one that most merits attention, is that which represents the assassination of William I, prince of Orange, which is affectingly tragick, and finely executed. We next visited the old palace, where this great man resided at the time of this fatal catastrophe, which was perpetrated by Balthasar Gerard, who was first instigated by a monk, in consequence of a bounty the brutality of Philip II led him to offer in a publick edict for this purpose.</P>
<P>THEY shewed us the spot where he fell at the foot of the stairs, and two holes which the balls made in the wall after having gone through the prince's head. On the wall is a Dutch inscription.</P>
<P>THE assassin desired to speak with the prince in private, just as he rose from
<PB N="62" REF="023039_0059_0FBB9F2A29B35AA0"/>
table, and plunged himself into a ditch, after having executed his bloody design; but was immediately taken, and rolled naked in a cask, driven full of sharp nails, until he expired.</P>
<P>THE old and new churches are capi∣tal buildings; each adorned with lofty steeples, and uncommonly harmonious chimes, which quite delighted us as we were entering the latter, a stupendous pile, where the ashes of the immortal prince of Orange, already mentioned, rest in peace. In contemplating this magnifick tomb, I cannot express what I felt in recollecting the series of hard and vir∣tuous struggles in which he contended, to stem against the persevering barbarity of the duke of Alva. Recapitulating in my mind the variety of his conflicts— his fatal end—and the striking similarity of his and our great <HI>Washington</HI>'s charac∣ters, my enthusiasm betrayed me into an
<PB N="63" REF="023039_0060_0FBB9F2B2946D560"/>
involuntary sigh of homage, accompanied by a tear, which I detected stealing slyly down my cheek. Indeed their fame, and the importance of their atchievements are such, in the scale of human events, that their names deserve to be written by the rays of the sun on the surface of the HEAVENS.</P>
<P>THE prince's statue in marble, lies upon the top of the tomb, with his fa∣vourite dog at his feet, who, according to tradition, died with grief, immediate∣ly after his master.</P>
<P>THE tomb lies under the representa∣tion of heaven, which is supported by twenty two black marble columns, upon the top of which stands Fame with her trumpet sounding over him, and this motto—<HI>"te vindico tutor libertas."</HI> Be∣sides the statue on the tomb, there is an∣other
<PB N="64" REF="023039_0061_0FBB9F2D62B92518"/>
in brass, full length, and many other ornaments in brass and marble.</P>
<P>THE succeeding princes of Orange are all interred in this church.</P>
<P>IN the old church we saw the monu∣ments of the admirals Peter Heine, Van Tromp, and the famous Luwenhock the physician. The arsenal, we are told, is the largest in the republick, and worthy a traveller's inspection—but our time de∣nied us the pleasure of seeing it.</P>
<P>DELFT is celebrated for its earthen ware, and formerly succeeded in a fine imitation of porcelain, which are both on the decline.</P>
<P>THE streets are very broad, two of which are a mile in extent, and the fronts of many houses are paved with black and white marble.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="023039_0062_0FBB9F2EF272C3B0"/>THE ringing of the seven o'clock bell hurried us on board of our trukschute, upon a full canter through the streets; where we secured the roof all to our∣selves; but did not arrive in this superb city until late in the evening, which was serene; but the thick exhalations from the canal prevented the moon from shew∣ing us the country: Her pale beams quivered lightly upon the water, but too dimly to enable us to distinguish objects; however, the lights from the summer houses compensated in some de∣gree.</P>
<P>THE dampness of the evening air, so pernicious in Holland, obliged us to box up in our cabin; but we saw the coun∣try near the canal from our cabin win∣dows, as we passed.</P>
<P>WE had a merry evening, but the stench of the canal was intolerable as
<PB N="66" REF="023039_0063_0FBB9F3070E10FC0"/>
we approached the Hague, which not a little surprised us.</P>
<P>WE were puzzled in the streets to find our hôtel, but were soon relieved by a genius watching his opportuni∣ty for new comers; he threw out his bait, which my unguarded fellow trav∣ellers (who were green in the ways of the world) eagerly catched at—but as my experience in the broad world had taught me their manoeuvres, I only suf∣fered him to shew us the street, and then, with the best grace in my power, wished him a <HI>decided</HI> good night.</P>
<P>WE took lodgings at l' hôtel of Eng∣lish parliament, an excellent house, where they speak French and English, and have the best attendance.</P>
<P>A PROPOS, I omitted to mention to you, that the great and wise Grotius was
<PB N="67" REF="023039_0064_0FBB9F3442B227B0"/>
buried in the new church, near the prince; this unfortunate man fell a vic∣tim to the rash resentment of prince Maurice, successor to his father Wil∣liam I.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>HAGUE, <DATE>3d June, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT will be presumptuous in me to attempt a description of this most beautiful city, till I have fairly seen and examined it: For I find the objects are so important, and the place, in every respect, so much beyond my conceptions, that I shall be obliged to devote several pages to this subject alone; but I will endeavour to be as concise as possible.— Indeed my letters are of such horrid lengths, that I will try to hash up my cookery of description in future in a more laconick journal style, which is
<PB N="69" REF="023039_0066_0FBB9F38A7A4A6B0"/>
less formal, and often more interesting and familiar than a stiff epistolary one.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="day's events">
<HEAD>Sunday, <HI>June</HI> 4.</HEAD>
<P>I TOOK care to appear in print, espec∣ially as my first step was to pay my re∣spects to the American ambassador, John Adams, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> but his absence turned my attention to the churches, it being then the height of their devotion.</P>
<P>THE Dutch churches I have seen are all divested of those gaudy ornaments, so common in France and other catho∣lick countries: On the contrary, they have a certain melancholy gloom, owing to the walls being covered with the arms of the principal families, worked upon black velvet, and bordered with broad black frames. These give the appear∣ance, or at least an idea, of the inside of large tombs. The Dutch priests were
<PB N="70" REF="023039_0067_0FBB9F3A32045A10"/>
thumping the cushions to large and crowded audiences, who stood all with their hats on.</P>
<P>FROM the churches I repaired to the grand parade, where the garrison of the Hague was reviewed by the prince of Orange, the two young princes, and a great concourse of nobility and citizens.</P>
<P>THE troops are bold stout fellows, dressed in blue faced with red. I squeez∣ed in close to the prince, and had a fair chance to contemplate—the man—with∣out being governed by appearances, which are indeed much against him. He is of a middling stature, effeminate, with a disagreeable stooping gait; add to which a stupid and inanimate countenance.</P>
<P>AFTER saying thus much of the prince, can I venture to observe to an English∣man, that we were five in company, and
<PB N="71" REF="023039_0068_0FBB9F3D40BBED60"/>
were all struck equally with an idea, that there is a strong family resemblance be∣tween the prince and the king of Eng∣land, who you know are related by the marriage of the princess Anne, daughter to George II, and mother to the prince?</P>
<P>FROM parade we strolled through the principal squares, and many other parts of this superb and truly elegant city, which delighted us extremely. Though the magnificent buildings on the bomb quay at Rotterdam far excelled any oth∣ers I had then seen in Europe—yet the Hague eclipses and must exceed, the most brilliant imagination. It is generally al∣lowed to be the most elegant city in Eu∣rope—perhaps in the world.</P>
<P>AT two o'clock I returned again to the grand hôtel belonging to the thir∣teen United States of America, lately purchased by Mr. Adams, for the resi∣dence
<PB N="72" REF="023039_0069_0FBB9F3FF41EBA48"/>
of our future ambassadors. It is decently furnished, has a large library, and an elegant little garden. I was re∣ceived in the most cordial manner, din∣ed with the ambassador, and in the af∣ternoon we took an airing in his car∣riage, through the best part of the city, and then to the pleasant fishing town of Schewling, two miles from the Hague, upon the borders of the sea. The weath∣er being fine, the road and side walks were full of people, all pushing forward, on foot and in carriages, to enjoy the sea breeze, and walk on the beach.</P>
<P>THE novelty, and the roaring of the uncouth cook maids, with which the waggons were crowded, exceedingly a∣mused me; but their singing, or rath∣er yelling, was comparatively like the squalling of as many cats, roasting over a roaring fire: They seemed to vie with each other which should make the most
<PB N="73" REF="023039_0070_0FBB9F41A16E3270"/>
noise, but without the least harmony or unison;—their mouths were frightful∣ly distended—and their faces ready to burst with their efforts—which, added to their singular dress, produced a laughable scene.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>THIS scene brought to my mind a very absurd and awk∣ward custom, prevalent in America; though on the other extreme. In France every one finds himself perfectly at ease with all around him the first moment he enters a circle; and conversation is as animated, and as unrestrained in a full company, as among a few select friends. In England and America, the reverse is the case—let a Frenchman be intro∣duced into a large circle at their first meeting—he must sup∣pose himself dropped into a society of Quakers. Every one seems at first afraid to break silence, for fear of the criticisms of the rest—by degrees however the charm is dissolved, and it is ten to one if another foreigner should be ushered in, four hours from the first, that he would suppose himself in Bedlam; this extraordinary reverse comes on progressively.</P><P>AS soon as the company begin to find themselves at ease with one another, and their frozen tongues a little unbent; should a young lady be in the circle, some gentleman, or perhaps the lady of the house, will call on her to sing—she directly declares "she never sung in her life," though per∣haps half the company have been entertained with her sing∣ing before—as this subterfuge therefore will not avail her, the whole company fall upon her like hungry dogs upon their prey—then she protests—"she has a bad cold"—all mouths are again opened—sing! sing! you must sing!—thus hunted down, after a sew—hems—and still persisting in her bad cold—the fair syren opens her harmonious throat, and quivers out perhaps a good song, or perhaps something like the Dutch waggon girls—as it may happen!—and, at any rate, she calls her veracity seriously in question in face of the whole company.</P><P>HAVING resided and travelled several years in most parts of France, I will freely confess myself strongly prepossessed in favour of their general customs, and I ardently hope we shall rub in our American composition a seasoning of the French—<HI>sant souci</HI> and <HI>vive la bagatelle.</HI> They undoubtedly are the happiest people in Europe, owing to a charming cli∣mate, light diet, good wines, vivacity, and living under a des∣potick government; which though unfriendly to liberty, and that noble expansion of the human soul—yet it has a tenden∣cy to check ambition; they glide oh with easy gales in their passage through life, if blessed with a good monarch, and a bad one is their greatest danger.—One half of the unhappi∣ness of mankind arises from ambition; and as happiness is the main end of this life, that government which pro∣duces the largest share, is, in my humble estimation, the best,</P></NOTE></P>

<P><PB N="75" REF="023039_0072_0FBB9F44AE236E90"/>THE road is charming, and entirely shaded by a double row of trees, so ex∣actly lined that we saw the steeple of the village church from the gates of the city, through an arch formed by the limbs of the trees.</P>
<P>THE north sea opened to our view all at once, at the end of the avenue. Nature has kindly provided a barrier against the ocean, by the downs which are thrown up along the principal part of the coast of this low country; which I also ob∣served on the coast of the Austrian Neth∣erlands, in travelling through that coun∣try a few years past. But they owe their principal security to the dykes and dams.</P>
<P>I AM told there was in this village, a kind of waggon constructed by prince Maurice's principal engineer, which they say would go upon the sand along the

<P>PEOPLE often bathe here in the sum∣mer; but what is very singular, I am as∣sured that the fishermen's daughters, not only guard the men's clothes, but wipe them dry with towels as they leave the water; and this with perfect <HI>sang froid</HI>; which plainly proves how far custom and habit may reconcile us to any thing.</P>
<P>THE coast was full of small fishing vessels. Some we saw at sea.</P>
<P>THE count de Bentinck's famous gar∣dens are upon this road, and are well worth seeing. They belonged former∣ly to the duke of Portland, who was particularly patronized by William III. They are distinguished from all other gardens in the province, by their style, simplicity, and picturesque views; such

<P>ON our return we passed the prince, walking, with a numerous retinue.— Spent the evening with Mr. Adams, and the famous Monsieur Dumas, his secretary, who eminently distinguished himself in the early part of our con∣test, at the court of France, as well as by gaining us weighty friends in this re∣publick.</P>

<HEAD>Monday, <HI>June</HI> 5.</HEAD>
<P>BREAKFASTED with Mr. Adams—af∣ter which we visited <HI>la Maison du Bois,</HI> which is situated about a mile from the Hague, in the centre of the largest nat∣ural wood in Holland, and the only one, except the wood near Haerlem.</P>
<P>THIS palace was built by the widow of prince Henry Frederick, for a house of mourning. It is an elegant structure and entirely sequestered from the gay world, being in a manner embosomed in a grove, cut into many romantick walks leading from the palace, which has a large garden behind it. Over the gate we saw the arms of Orange Nassau, and entered by a flight of steps.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="023039_0076_0FBB9F4EDC2A9240"/>THE grand saloon, with its exquisite paintings, are the principal objects of at∣tention, and mostly executed by those great masters, Rubens and Van der Worf, representing in very large pieces, the brilliant triumphs of Frederick Henry, who finished the fabrick of independence for his country, which was founded by his immortal father, and vigorously car∣ried on by his gallant brother Prince Maurice.</P>
<P>AS I was born with a tincture of a painter's soul, I found in this saloon, a luxurious feast for the eyes. The widow Amelia in her weeds, is represented in the middle of the ceiling of the cupola over the gallery, where the musicians former∣ly played, to sooth her melancholy.</P>
<P>RUBENS' <HI>Vulcan in his shop,</HI> placed very properly near the fire, is esteemed the fin∣est in the collection: But what pleased
<PB N="80" REF="023039_0077_0FBB9F4FE3E5D990"/>
me most, was the full length portraits of William I, and Prince Maurice; who are also represented in busts of mar∣ble placed over the chimney.</P>
<P>THE floors are black walnut, covered with rich carpets. In one of the apart∣ments we saw a valuable India japanned railing, enclosing the princess's bed; which is inlaid with the mother of pearl, and cost twenty eight thousand guilders. In another apartment was shewn us a flow∣er piece, the work of a Flemish master, and valued at fifteen thousand florins. I was so enraptured with the paint∣ings, that after a full hour's eager ex∣amination, I left them with regret.</P>
<P>MR. Adams then discharged his car∣riage, and we walked two hours more about the forest, which was very pleas∣ing to me, notwithstanding the road were heavy and sandy. The lofty oak
<PB N="81" REF="023039_0078_0FBB9F516DE43AE0"/>
seemed to be so promiscuously thrown together, that it revived in my breast a lively picture of many such situations I had seen in the course of my tour through the United States of America, some years since. Our eyes were delighted with the fine plumage of the birds, whose sweet melody reechoed through the woods.</P>
<P>DINED at the American hôtel; and in the afternoon we made an excursion to the neat village of Ryswick, situated be∣tween the Hague and Delft, two miles from the former. The road is well paved, and beautifully adorned by lofty trees and fine meadows on each side. This village is famous for the peace concluded here in 1697.</P>
<P>THE palace is situated about a quarter of a mile from the village. It belongs to the prince of Orange, and is nobly built with hewn stone; but going fast
<PB N="82" REF="023039_0079_0FBB9F52E9538378"/>
to ruin. The assembly chamber is cele∣brated for the echo of a whisper from the opposite walls, the same as the whis∣pering gallery at St. Paul's in London. It is decorated with a marble stair case, marble floors, fine gardens, and a good terrace.</P>
<P>SPENT the afternoon in viewing dif∣ferent places, which will come under a general description of the Hague. The evening I passed with Mr. A—, who introduced me to the Dutch ambassador (on the point of going to the court of London) the famous author Dr. Mc Lane, and several other gentry who came to make their visits.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="day's events">
<HEAD>TUESDAY NIGHT, 12 o'clock.</HEAD>
<P>I AM amply provided with letters of introduction from Mr. A— and Mons. Dumas, for Leyden and Amsterdam;
<PB N="83" REF="023039_0080_0FBB9F55205F6638"/>
and intend leaving this charming place in the morning, on my way thither: But I must now sum up all I have to say about the Hague in as few words as possible.</P>
<P>I SPENT this forenoon in rambling at large in this city; dined again with Mr. A—, and in the afternoon we took an airing to Delft. We passed through several barriers, rode a circumference round the ramparts of that city, and re∣turned in the evening along the edge of the canal. But I must not omit to tell you that if I had not exerted myself, I should probably have witnessed the un∣pleasant scene of one of the most brilliant characters of the age (Mr. A——) scram∣bling in a muddy canal, his wig afloat upon the surface, and all from a laudable zeal to save a child then drowning; the moment he saw the struggling infant bobbing on the top, I thought he would
<PB N="84" REF="023039_0081_0FBB9F5A84E6FD58"/>
have darted headforemost into the canal, regardless of his personal safety: But I restrained his impetuosity for a moment, as a lusty fellow had that instant soused himself in.</P>
<P>IN popularity and influence at this court, Mr. A— undoubtedly bears the palm in the diplomatick body. He is universally esteemed, for his profound penetration and extensive political knowl∣edge, the first character our western world has yet produced.</P>
<P>HE talks but little—thinks a great deal —and what he says is always to the pur∣pose; and in point of future events, his words seem to be the words of an oracle. He may indeed be considered as a veteran in politicks, having long acted a conspic∣uous and important part, and acquired vast experience at several of the courts of Europe, in a very serious crisis.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="023039_0082_0FBB9F5C01294D60"/>THOUGH he does not ape the graces of a Chesterfield, yet we have found in him the more important accomplishments of an ambassador; for his stern republican virtues, have in every instance rose supe∣riour to the duplicity and affected con∣sequence of European courtiers. Amer∣ica stands indebted to him principally for three important acquisitions—The de∣feat of Sir Joseph Yorke, and securing the patronage of Holland, in a critical moment—the extension of our limits— and the security of our fisheries. Hav∣ing completely accomplished every object of his ambition relative to America, it appears probable that this country may yet be indebted to his active genius, as an instrument in producing some reforms in the system of their heavy moulded and convulsed government.</P>
<P>HAGUE is situated only two miles from the sea, and nine S. W. from Leyden:
<PB N="86" REF="023039_0083_0FBB9F5D6CE9E108"/>
And notwithstanding it is termed a vil∣lage (because it is not walled and sends no deputies to the States) yet it enjoys other advantages, sufficient to rank it a∣mong the first cities of Europe, both for opulence and beauty.</P>
<P>LORD Chesterfield declares it to be the most elegant city in the world.</P>
<P>IT contains six thousand houses and forty five thousand inhabitants, surround∣ed by a canal bordered by lofty trees. It is the seat of their government, and the residence of all foreign ministers, which together draw such a concourse as con∣tributes principally to the support of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE situation is esteemed healthy, be∣ing somewhat elevated, and in the heart of a fruitful country, surrounded by wall∣ed cities, villages, beautiful country
<PB N="87" REF="023039_0084_0FBB9F5F0FB20548"/>
houses, magnificent gardens, and charm∣ing meadows. Many of the streets are finely shaded, and in general spacious. The houses are for the most part built with hewn stone, and of the first rate, both in size and elegance.</P>
<P>THE squares are numerous, and all planted with large trees. The inhabit∣ants are a model of the Parisians; very polite, and entirely <HI>a la François</HI>; seldom speaking their native language, and much addicted to gambling. The ladies of the <HI>beau monde</HI> are fond of gallantry and dissipation, and are in general very hand∣some. The palace of the prince of Y—g is esteemed the finest building at the Hague; and those of the princes G—t and V—st, are all compara∣tively like as many palaces; they are fronted by a handsome grove, and a canal.</P>
<P>THE prince G—t's has a noble effect. It is half a mile long, very broad, with a
<PB N="88" REF="023039_0085_0FBB9F618E2E5348"/>
canal passing through it, and finely shad∣ed with trees, and a number of stone bridges (with iron railings) crossing it.</P>
<P>THE Vyverburg is also fronted by the most elegant houses on one side; oppo∣site to which are stately trees, with a spa∣cious bason of water faced with hewn stone between, and a romantick little island in its centre, full of trees. Near this is a very large grove of trees, with a railed mall in the middle. The most material building is the court, situ∣ated nearly in the centre of the town, where the Stadtholder resides.</P>
<P>THE council of state, the council of nobility, the courts of justice, and in short all publick business, centres here. It is surrounded by a fosse, and the en∣trances into it are by three draw bridges, where the guards are stationed ready to raise them in case of a riot; this does
<PB N="89" REF="023039_0086_0FBB9F62A3AB6C88"/>
not seem altogether an eligible situation for the free debates of a republican as∣sembly, eternally jealous of their stadt∣holder; nor entirely <HI>consistent,</HI> as men are often under influence from their lo∣cal positions.</P>
<P>THIS palace is very old, which, in my estimation, makes more in favour of its exteriors than any particular elegance it may be thought to possess.</P>
<P>THE great saloon is in the antique style, and full of the trophies of victo∣ries gained over their enemies.</P>
<P>THE chamber of the states general is hung on one side with rich tapestry, or∣namented with the portraits of six stadt∣holders: On the other some excellent pieces, and all at full length. The cham∣ber where the twelve years truce was set∣tled, between Spain and Holland, in 1609,
<PB N="90" REF="023039_0087_0FBB9F64219171E0"/>
is also ornamented with the same por∣traits, and the republick represented over the chimney, under the figure of a woman —the room is very luminous and over∣looks the Vyver.</P>
<P>THE council chamber contains a string of paintings, representing the actions of Claudius Civilius, by Holbein, for which lord Bolingbroke offered 10,000l. ster∣ling. This Claudius, was a Batavian by birth, and held a principal command in the Roman army, but proved a traitor in the end, and, like our infamous Arnold, was afterwards their most implacable en∣emy.</P>
<P>IN the ambassadors audience room, there is an excellent painting of William III. The prince's cabinet, on the oppo∣site side of the court, is undoubtedly the greatest curiosity at the Hague. Con∣noisseurs admire, with justice, his collec∣tion
<PB N="91" REF="023039_0088_0FBB9F6A37E8F530"/>
of precious stones, fossils, miner∣als, petrefactions, and other natural curi∣osities.</P>
<P>THE library pictures, and the gallery of paintings, next claim your particular attention. These paintings consist prin∣cipally of sacred and historical pieces, some landscapes and portraits, the works of the famous Raphael, Rubens, Holbein, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE celebrated de Witt's two patriot brothers, the mortal enemies of the prince of Orange, were massacred by a misguided rabble at the state prison near the palace.</P>
<P>THE other publick buildings of note, are the cloister church, the hôtel d' Op∣dam, the Jews synagogue, the foundery, prince Maurice's palace, poor house, lep∣ers' house, spin houses, town house, and the French play house.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="023039_0089_0FBB9F6CB97DE158"/>THE celebrated fair in the month of May was one of their principal amuse∣ments, as they were formerly all masked in the streets, but now they only walk in parties, to buy trinkets, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>WEDNESDAY, <HI>June</HI> 7.</HEAD>
<P>THIS morning at nine o'clock, I left the Hague, on my way to Leyden. We had a strong gale against us, which did not however sensibly check our progress.</P>
<P>WE were about three hours perform∣ing this trip. The canal, the whole way was very spacious (say about fifty feet wide) and the water above the level of the country, which added much to the advantage of our prospect; which was in every respect equal in feats, summer houses, and the face of the country, to that already described between Rotterdam and Delft: But from the continual pass∣ing
<PB N="93" REF="023039_0090_0FBB9F6E0B080D08"/>
of trukschutes, and not understand∣ing the abrupt orders of our skipper, I was frequently in danger, on the top of the boat, of getting my legs tripped up by the rope; but this may be easily a∣voided, by keeping below, which my ea∣ger curiosity would by no means listen to.</P>
<P>I formed an acquaintance with an in∣telligible inhabitant of Leyden, who, on our approach to the city, shewed me the ground from whence the Spaniards un∣der general Baldsez besieged this place; as also the vestiges of one of their old forts.</P>
<P>I COULD not contemplate the horrors of this cruel six months siege, without a heart felt sympathy; especially when I recollected the tragick picture given of it in Watson's Phillip.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="023039_0091_0FBB9F6F9BB4F4E0"/>HE says—"When the Spaniards en∣deavoured to intimidate them into a sur∣render of the town, they nobly answered —'that they had maturely weighed their situation, and were resolved to perish, with their wives and children, in the flames of the city, kindled by their own hands, or die with hunger, rather than submit to the Spaniards'—the misery which only existed in imagination, dur∣ing the two first months of the siege, was at last fatally realized as they were reduced to the hard necessity of eating their dogs and horses."</P>
<P>LEYDEN is situated six miles from the sea, and nineteen south of Amsterdam.</P>
<P>IN point of size, it yields only to Am∣sterdam, and is as neat and pleasant as any town in the republick. It is sup∣posed to contain forty thousand souls,
<PB N="95" REF="023039_0092_0FBB9F70EF8FC800"/>
which is indeed a small number in pro∣portion to its size.</P>
<P>THE city is well fortified, with a wide ditch, adorned with rows of trees; the buildings are beautiful, and the streets in general very spacious, and perfectly clean and white, particularly broad street, which runs quite through the city, from the Hague gate to the Utrecht gate: This street rises in the middle, and is finely paved. The others have in general a canal in the middle, adorned as usual, with stately trees, some three rows on a side, which give them the appearance of so many alleys of a beautiful garden.</P>
<P>THE city is built on the old Rhine, which divides it into fifty islands, of which thirty one may be sailed round in boats. It has one hundred and forty five bridges (built of stone) with iron railings, one hundred and eighty streets, and forty two towers on the walls.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="023039_0093_0FBB9F7368BA0E50"/>THE stadthouse is an old long struc∣ture, built in 1597, in the true Dutch style. The building has nothing re∣markable to claim a traveller's notice; but there are however some fine paintings in the grand chamber—particularly a large one representing the citizens of Leyden, when relieved from the horrid siege (already mentioned) by boats com∣ing to their relief over an artificial sea. The best painting is a whimsical repre∣sentation of the day of judgment, by the famous Luke Leyden, who is said to be the first modern painter who had true ideas of perspective: This painting is certainly the production of the most fer∣tile imagination; but with what just∣ness he has delineated the confusion of this important and awful day, remains yet to be decided.—He died in 1533.</P>
<P>THE largest church, is a vast pile, but in other respects, merits no other partic∣ular
<PB N="97" REF="023039_0094_0FBB9F75A8AB54C8"/>
notice, than to pay the tribute of homage due to the manes of that great physician and philosopher, Boerhaave, who enlightened the world with the flame of his genius; his monument is admired for its elegant simplicity.</P>
<P>THE reputation of this great man ex∣tended into China: A mandarin wrote to him with this inscription—<HI>"To</HI> BOER∣HAAVE <HI>in Europe</HI>;"—and the letter came regularly to him.</P>
<P>THE city of Leyden have raised a mon∣ument in the church of St. Peter to the salutary genius of Boerhaave, <HI>"Salutife∣ro Boerhaave genio sacrum."</HI> It consists of an urn upon a pedestal of black marble; six heads, four of which represent the four ages of life, and two, the sciences in which Boerhaave excelled, form a group issuing between the urn and its support∣ers. The capital of the basis is decorat∣ed with a drapery of white marble, in
<PB N="98" REF="023039_0095_0FBB9F77D3EC5398"/>
which the artist has shewn the different em∣blems of disorders and their remedies. A∣bove upon the surface of the pedestal is the medallion of Boerhaave; at the extrem∣ity of the frame a ribbon displays the favourite motto of this learned man, <HI>Sim∣plex sigillum veri.</HI>—truth unarrayed. Boer∣haave quitted the stage of an active and useful life in 1738, aged sixty nine years.</P>
<P>WE saw an old castle in the middle of the town, called the Burg, which was, ac∣cording to tradition, built in the ninth century; it is six hundred and ten feet in circumference, and we ascended the top by fifty steps; from whence we com∣manded a complete and charming view of the city, the adjacent meadows, downs, and the Haerlem sea. Within the Burg there is a well of great depth, in which (according to the history of the Span∣ish siege under Baldsez) the inhabitants caught a large fish, which they shewed
<PB N="99" REF="023039_0096_0FBB9F79242D4AA0"/>
in triumph from the walls to the enraged Spaniards. They pretend also that there is a communication from the bottom of this well under ground to Catwyk.</P>
<P>THE university is highly worthy at∣tention. It was founded in 1575, by the states, in gratitude for their brave defence, and is the principal of the five which are in the United Provinces, viz. Leyden, Utrecht, Franeker (in Friesland) Groningen and Harderwicke. The build∣ing is old and awkward; but the pro∣fessors have been the most eminent in Europe, such as Liprices, Scaliger, Sal∣marius, Heinsius, and the renowned Boerhaave.</P>
<P>THE botanical garden, with its stat∣ues, the cabinet of natural curiosities, the library, anatomy, petrefactions, and fossils, are very fine, and well attended. In the physical garden we saw the Amer∣ican
<PB N="100" REF="023039_0097_0FBB9F7AA27E75A8"/>
aloe, which blossoms only once a century, green and bohea tea, coffee, and a vast variety of what I am very inade∣quate to say much about, curiously dis∣played. Among the natural curiosities I was shewn many wonderful phenome∣na in nature.</P>
<P>THE library is only open to men of letters twice a week. This university enjoys many great privileges, even to in∣flict death; but the professors are subser∣vient to the court of Holland.</P>
<P>THE manufactures of this place were formerly very extensive, particularly in blue and black superfine broad cloths, which they had the secret of dying to greater perfection than any other nation (as the French now have the scarlet;) but they have declined very much of late years: They manufacture also narrow cloths and camblets.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="023039_0098_0FBB9F7FE4B36A90"/>THERE are many fine seats in the vi∣cinity of Leyden which strangers visit out of curiosity. Their butter is excellent.</P>
<P>DINED at the Lion d'Or. Immediate∣ly after dinner I sallied forth alone, which is not always the best method of acquir∣ing knowledge in a strange country—as one is obliged to depend on very precari∣ous information.—But it is attended with some advantages, as one is at leisure to make observations on the general man∣ners of the people unrestrained—espec∣ially their treatment of strangers. I went into a dozen shops; some un∣derstood me in French; but with those who did not speak French I had like to have unhinged my under jaw in labour∣ing—without bringing forth six words of their language. I conceited myself looking like one of their tobacco head signs, with my mouth horridly distorted.—They are indeed civil, but have not that pleasing
<PB N="102" REF="023039_0099_0FBB74576B9B6808"/>
anxiety to help out a stranger, so pecu∣liar to the French women, who hold a foreigner kindly by the button of his coat, and in a manner hammer words into his brain, with their fore finger pressing gently upon his sleeve.</P>
<P>I REMARKED in this Don Quixote excursion, that the common class of peo∣ple (such as shopkeepers, &amp;c.) are very serious—their sensibility keen—they are easy to blush—they cannot support a joke or compliment—the first their jeal∣ousy construes into an insult—the last confuses them: They laugh with pain, and never without cause—and when the laugh of the company falls on one pair of shoulders, their sensibility is always stabbed to the quick, and proclaimed openly to the whole company by mes∣sengers flying from the heart and every irritable part of the body, bursting into a blaze upon their cheeks. Such being the
<PB N="103" REF="023039_0100_0FBB7453373558B8"/>
effect of a joke in Holland, surely every generous mind will wave this resource of amusing company, and wisely measure his conduct in all countries, by the preju∣dices and prevailing customs of its inhab∣itants; who are always governed by some general caprice, peculiar to themselves.</P>
<P>I FELL in fortunately with the deacon of the presbyterian church, who spoke French perfectly: The moment he found I was an American, the muscles of his face and the expression of his eye plainly declared his partiality for my country; he left his affairs, and I found him very intelligent; to his information, with what I collected from Mons. Luzac, I am prin∣cipally indebted for the account I have already given of Leyden.</P>
<P>I FORGOT to mention that this church is the identical one, where the original Brownists worshipped, previously to form∣ing
<PB N="104" REF="023039_0101_0FBB74586E930CC8"/>
their first establishment in Plymouth, Newengland, in 1620. The building is very old and inelegant; but I viewed it with more abstracted satisfaction than a palace. The deacon assured me that Mr. A— could not refrain from tears, in contemplating this ancient structure; a veneration and homage due to the vir∣tuous founders of Newengland, and wor∣thy of this great man.</P>
<P>SUPPED with Mons. Luzac, the fa∣mous lawyer, to whom I had letters. I was charmed with his conversation, and found him ready to answer me any ques∣tions, in any language; but as I am con∣fined to two, we conversed in them in∣differently.</P>
<P>THIS gentleman is celebrated through∣out Europe for his uncommon talents and extensive knowledge; and more par∣ticularly for his patriotism, and being the
<PB N="105" REF="023039_0102_0FBB9C5D638B6550"/>
editor of the Leyden Gazette, which is universally esteemed the best in circula∣tion.</P>
<P>AT eleven o'clock I returned home to my lodgings, along the sides of the canals by the light of a dim moon; but what was very singular in so large a city, all was as quiet and hush as in the open country, and not a soul stirring—owing to the decline of population. Mons. Luzac says they formerly estimated sev∣enty thousand inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE English woollen manufactories have given it a fatal stab.</P>

<HEAD>THURSDAY, <HI>June</HI> 8.</HEAD>
<P>AT nine o'clock this pleasant morning we were moving through another fine canal, seemingly like going on the road to Paradise.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="023039_0103_0FBB9C6195A69A40"/>I POSSESSED the roof with a naval of∣ficer (of capital connexions, if I can credit <HI>his assertion</HI>;) among other circumstances, he mentioned, a singular method of duel∣ing in Holland, among the vulgar, with short knives. The contending parties are happily confined to the face, which they defend with as much dexterity with their short knives, as Frenchmen do their bodies with long swords; but they owe their safety more to a singular knack of throwing back their bodies.</P>
<P>WHILE we were exchanging truks∣chutes on our way—the men and women were all <HI>piss ants promiscuously en concert</HI>— which I find they can do with as good a <HI>grace</HI>—as Sterne's Madame <HI>Ramboulet</HI> at Paris.</P>
<P>WE traversed over a pleasant coun∣try between the downs of Haerlem lake on our right, and the downs which run
<PB N="107" REF="023039_0104_0FBB9C62AA0D0B90" MS="y"/>
along parallel with the ocean on our left. Within a few miles of Haerlem the country assumes a new aspect, be∣ing all sweetly diversified, in a continu∣ed chain of beautiful and elegant seats; a large forest, and a variety of delightful views.</P>
<P>IT was in this forest, that the celebrat∣ed Laurensz Jansez Koster, alderman of Haerlem, first suggested the invention of printing with types, in 1440. He was rambling carelessly alone, and amusing himself in cutting out letters in pieces of wood; with which he made some impres∣sions, which led to the types: And it is to this fortunate chance that mankind owe the facility of communicating their ideas. John Faust, a servant of the Alderman's, stole off the types to Mentz, where he pretended to conjuration, and assumed to himself the merit of the discovery. This is the same Doctor Faustus so much
<PB N="108" REF="023039_0105_0FBB9C66B0A65498"/>
known among the vulgar in America for his league with the devil, &amp;c.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after dinner we went to see the first essays Koster made with his wooden types, which are to be seen in the type manufactory opposite to the old ca∣thedral. His statue, with an elegant Latin inscription, is in the town house. The world stand indebted to the late in∣genious Baskerville of Birmingham, in England, for the most elegant improve∣ment in the art of printing. We exam∣ined the process of making types, which is very curious and expeditious.</P>
<P>From hence we viewed the old cathe∣dral, where we saw the first organ in the world, made at Haerlem by the ingenious Mullar, in 1738. It is a stupendous piece of grandeur and ingenuity, contain∣ing eight thousand pipes, the largest of which are sixteen inches diameter, and
<PB N="109" REF="023039_0106_0FBB9C69CAA82258"/>
thirty eight feet long. It has sixty eight stops, and imitates most admirably, the human voice, solus, or in chorus; differ∣ent kinds of birds, trumpets, flutes, fifes, and a kettle drum. They play the or∣gan two days in the week, for the a∣musement of strangers and the citizens; but, if by particular desire, it will cost a ducat to the organist and a gratuity to the blower.</P>
<P>There are two silver bells upon the church, which were taken by the famous Admiral Braakel (whose tomb I saw at Rotterdam) at <HI>Damietta</HI> in Egypt; as also three small ships suspended in the church, with saws on their sterns, repre∣senting the cutting of the chain of the Nile already mentioned.</P>
<P>WE were shewn in this church bullets sticking in the sides of the walls, which were fired by the Spaniards during the
<PB N="110" REF="023039_0107_0FBB9C6AEA274E38"/>
terrible siege they sustained in 1572, a∣gainst the duke of Alva's son, count Frederick.</P>
<P>THE city was gallantly defended by four thousand men, who were heroically supported by the women; but at length famine obliged them to yield; when two thousand people were the instant victims of Spanish fury, contrary to the express terms of capitulation.</P>
<P>HAERLEM lies about four miles from the sea, has eight gates, is built of brick, and the streets resemble those of Leyden. By an exact estimation, made about fifty years ago, this city contained seven thou∣sand nine hundred and sixty three houses, and fifty thousand people; at present the numbers do no exceed forty thousand.</P>
<P>THEIR trade is chiefly with Amster∣dam, and principally in linen, ribbons,
<PB N="111" REF="023039_0108_0FBB9C6E88E2B820"/>
some guazes, and tapes, of which they weave fifty pieces at a time by the aid of mills.</P>
<P>ITS situation, lying contiguous to Haerlem lake, and the peculiar slimy qualities of its water being more favour∣able to bleaching than any other, gives them a superiour advantage in the white∣ness of their linen.</P>
<P>THE Irish formerly sent vast quan∣tities of linen to be bleached here annu∣ally.</P>
<P>THE meadows all around the country are as white as our American fields after a snow storm.</P>
<P>THE stadthouse is a large building; where we saw several fine paintings in the prince's appartment, particularly that which represents the golden age.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="023039_0109_0FBB9C7026DA22F0"/>LATE in the afternoon, we left Haer∣lem and embarked for Amsterdam upon an elevated canal, running in a direct line, with a row of trees and stone posts upon our right. About half way we exchanged boats, and traversed across a little causeway which divides Haerlem lake upon our right, from the river Y upon our left, which falls by Amsterdam into the Zuder sea. This lake is four∣teen miles over each way, and was form∣ed by an inundation about three centu∣ries past, which buried seventy two towns and villages in its progress, and afforded a perfect representation of the flood in miniature—every living creature, and all the effects in the country, floating pro∣miscuously—some on the tops of the houses—others hanging to the limbs of trees, &amp;c. &amp;c. This famous lake would be only ranked as a pond in America, where nature forms every thing upon a broad scale—here it is thought more of,
<PB N="113" REF="023039_0110_0FBB9C71A5D96078"/>
than we think of our lake Superiour, which is capable of receiving three such republicks upon its area.</P>
<P>FROM the top of the causeway we had a full view both of the lake and river; as well as the stately palace of Zwanen∣berg, where the directors of the dykes and canals assemble.</P>
<P>THE canal led in a straight line from the causeway to Amsterdam, which we saw most of the way before us: But the variety we so justly expected to meet near the metropolis was by no means so pleas∣ing as in entering Haerlem—indepen∣dent of a strong stench rising from the stagnated canal water.</P>
<P>I TRAVERSED over the best part of Amsterdam before I came to my lodg∣ings, viz. at the first bible in the Hier Graght. I find the best inns dignify
<PB N="114" REF="023039_0111_0FBB9C77B4C17288"/>
their signs, by so many bibles. Dust and fatigue obliged me soon to send off for a hairdresser; and then to a <HI>surgeon</HI> to shave—for you must know, there are <HI>no shavers</HI> in Holland but <HI>professional</HI> sur∣geons—and commercial <HI>shavers.</HI>— Adieu! Good night!</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, <DATE>June, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS my only object in this country is to see the ways of the world, and to grasp at every useful or amusing information that comes within my reach; so I shall go in my loose Journal style until I see you.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="day's events">
<HEAD>SATURDAY.</HEAD>
<P>I EMPLOYED the whole day in taking a cursory view of this extensive metropo∣lis of the Seven Provinces; as well as the
<PB N="116" REF="023039_0113_0FBB9C7CC45D8208"/>
harbour, and a forest of shipping, which do not appear so numerous as upon the Thames. Viewed the docks, and saw several new men of war of seventy four guns, and several old ones, which they convey in and out of their artificial docks, and quite to the Texel, by the aid of camels; a curious invention, which re∣ceives their hulls within its body.</P>
<P>WE next viewed a clergyman's cab∣inet of natural curiosities—a great, and bigoted antiquarian: The collection was indeed extremely curious; but he dwelt on the latent merits of every object with so much ardour that we were glad to ef∣fect our retreat after some difficulty.</P>
<P>FROM thence, chance directed me into the Jews' synagogue; here I remained a full hour; and as it was the first time I was ever in a synagogue of a Saturday evening, I was much pleased with this
<PB N="117" REF="023039_0114_0FBB9C7DA29C61D0"/>
singular novelty—as well as the angelick shrill notes of a beautiful young lad, accompanied with those of an old fellow, (well known in the musical world by the name of Leonar) who was piping with his hollow, grum belly, a most admirable basso—indeed I could hardly persuade myself I was not deceived by a fine in∣strument, until a near approach to the altar convinced me the musick was vocal.</P>
<P>AS the sun verged towards the horizon, the voices, and agitation of the whole congregation, increased to such vehe∣mence, and gave them such frightful looks, that I was almost apprehensive they were falling into strong convulsions. Stunned with their bellowing, I was glad to retreat to the open air, not only for the safety of my head—but pockets—for in fact they looked, for the most part, like shabby theives and pickpockets.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="023039_0115_0FBB9C7F238F8018"/>THE women were all in galleries, peep∣ing through lattices.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="day's events">
<HEAD>SUNDAY.</HEAD>
<P>DEVOTED this day to rambling at large; in the afternoon at church.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="day's events">
<HEAD>MONDAY.</HEAD>
<P>VIEWED the stadthouse thoroughly, a description of which will come with Am∣sterdam. We saw from the top, the Zuy∣der sea, Haerlem lake, and this vast city, and a cloud of shipping below us; though the prospect encompassed a con∣siderable range of country, and a rich feast for contemplation, yet it does not equal the prospect from St. Laurence's church in Rotterdam.</P>
<P>THE chime on the stadthouse is sup∣posed to be the finest in Europe; we ex∣amined
<PB N="119" REF="023039_0116_0FBB9C8350ECFE18"/>
it throughout—an immense work indeed—we waited on the roof until it played; it is so contrived like an organ, that a man can play upon it with the same ease.</P>
<P>WE were shewn all the curiosities in this celebrated building, and were charm∣ed with the paintings; in particular the one by Vandyke, which represents the duke of Alva, in conference with the bur∣geoise of Amsterdam, before they abjured the Spanish yoke; this painting strongly represents that dark and bloody charac∣ter he afterwards exhibited to the world; at the same time a bold and martial as∣pect.</P>
<P>AT two o'clock I went upon the ex∣change and delivered my several letters of introduction from Mr. A—. This exchange is longer than London, but not so large, nor will it hold a compari∣son
<PB N="120" REF="023039_0117_0FBB9C852819F5F0"/>
either with that of London, or Rot∣terdam, in neatness or elegance, being built with brick, and divested of orna∣ments. At full change it was complete∣ly crowded. As I had nothing more than curiosity to engage my attention, I retired into one corner, to contemplate the scene; which led me to compare this exchange to a glass beehive I saw at the famous Wildman's at the foot of High∣gate hill, which was to all intents Am∣sterdam change in miniature. The buz was the same—the eagerness of the bees crowding into the hive; and their in∣dustry and ardour to collect the hon∣ey—was all the same—but it would be rather illiberal to carry the idea so far, as to suppose them all a set of insects, in general actuated by noth∣ing beyond the ideas of a bee, who trips from flower to flower, and roams abroad in the wide world, to suck in the sweets of every plant, with no other
<PB N="121" REF="023039_0118_0FBB9C8931D969E0"/>
view than to lay in a winter's stock for <HI>his dear self</HI>— which <HI>in conscience</HI> is the main spring that moves us sons of com∣merce, particularly in large cities: But happily for mankind, there are many no∣ble exceptions.</P>
<P>SPENT the evening at the French the∣atre, which is a small thatched house like a barn; the actors however were good; there were few genteel people at the play, which is very extraordinary in a me∣tropolis, especially as this is their only summer's amusement, in this line. The Dutch play house for winter amusements is much more elegant.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="day's events">
<HEAD>TUESDAY.</HEAD>
<P>CROSSED the river Y, or Wye, in a mix∣ed company of Germans, Americans, and English; and landed at Sardan, six miles from, and nearly opposite to, Amsterdam.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="023039_0119_0FBB9C8A64160598"/>WE passed through the shipping in the harbour, and then had a complete view of the river, and a forest of masts, ar∣ranged with much order.</P>
<P>IN approaching Sardan a battalion of windmills seemed to be drawn up in ar∣ray in our front. This extraordinary town appeared to us rather small, previ∣ously to our landing; but words are too feeble to express my surprise at the de∣ception, as well as the singularity and disposition of the houses, gardens, and almost every object in a style different from any I have yet seen.</P>
<P>SARDAN is situated in Northholland and contains near forty thousand wealthy inhabitants; some say it is the richest town in Holland. They have acquired this wealth principally by the wood trade, ship building, and a variety of cu∣rious mills for different purposes, partic∣ularly
<PB N="123" REF="023039_0120_0FBB9C8C1DF83DC0"/>
paper, powder, tobacco, boards, &amp;c. &amp;c. They shewed us a sawmill which works forty saws at a time.</P>
<P>THEY have so much timber always prepared on hand that they can do as much work as the building of a man of war in a week, by having three months previous notice. In general they build three hundred sail of merchantmen yearly.</P>
<P>AFTER rambling through this charm∣ing and very curious place for some hours, we were conducted to a small house, in which Peter the great boarded with the common workmen, at the time he learn∣ed the ship carpenter's trade <HI>incog.</HI> and was the most faithful and laborious man in the yard. He afterwards worked at Chatham docks in England.</P>
<P>THE woman of the house shewed us a gold medal lately presented her by the
<PB N="124" REF="023039_0121_0FBB9C9223E10348"/>
empress of Russia. This singular whim of Peter (who was one of the greatest sovereigns Europe was ever blessed with) prepared him for the great fatigues he afterwards endured in contending with Charles XII, of Sweden, and civilizing his extensive dominions.</P>
<P>THIS place is a perfect Chinese pic∣ture; the buildings are rather small, but most whimsically beautiful; and for the most part painted in various colours, and the roofs are of glazed tiles: They have in front handsome parterres; and gardens behind, so finely disposed, as to exceed all belief.</P>
<P>THE town covers over a large space of ground, the canals are very long, with a chain of these enchanting houses stretch∣ing in a line by their sides.</P>
<P>THE genius and customs of the North-Hollanders are different from the other
<PB N="125" REF="023039_0122_0FBB9C93664AD758"/>
provinces, and many are very singular; for instance—they push their excess of neat∣ness to such extremes that the masters of houses, are positively obliged by cus∣tom to pull off their shoes at their <HI>own doors,</HI> where a servant stands ready with a pair of slippers. Again, the front doors are never opened but in cases of death and marriage. The women are strangely metamorphosed, and differently dressed from the Southholland lasses: Their heads are bound up with broad gold, or brass ridges, running across their fore∣heads, they have light caps, their hair out short before—prodigious large earrings, and broad flat hats, cocked up in the air, made of calico; which have a singular effect: But under all these disadvantages, I saw many beautiful faces, but vile shapes; the girls look so much alike that one would be almost led to think they were all sisters.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="day's events">
<PB N="126" REF="023039_0123_0FBB9C9732A291F8"/>
<HEAD>WEDNESDAY.</HEAD>
<P>WE took a waggon for Bruck, six miles distant, which in many respects exceeds Sardan, and is allowed by travellers to be the very model and pink of neatness, for all Holland; and without exception, it might be drawn as the most perfect picture of any city or town in the world.</P>
<P>IT is chiefly inhabited by commercial veterans, who have retired from Amster∣dam, immersed in wealth. They carry on largely in the banking and insuring line. Neither horses or carriages, are suffered in the streets of this fairy village, which are finely paved with different coloured stones, fancifully worked in various rep∣resentations, and strewed lightly over with sand, with as much care as the inside of their houses; which are very curious in∣deed, and every thing we saw glittered
<PB N="127" REF="023039_0124_0FBB9C9A04591D08"/>
so strongly with neatness, that our eyes were fairly weakened with gazing.</P>
<P>THE preliminary article previous to a courtship, in Northholland, is very sin∣gular, but generally observed. The mis∣erable lover stands making under his mistress's window, two or three hours every night, for three months succes∣sively: If he holds out the siege firm∣ly to the end of this time, he is then admitted to her presence, upon the in∣tended ties of matrimony—but never before: She indeed at times, deigns to solace his trembling doubts, with a word of comfort. An intelligent English gentleman, residing in Holland, whom we met in the streets of Sardan, says this custom prevails only in Northholland, and originated from the Spaniards, who resided among them before the revolution. Heav∣ens! what a contrast between this and our bundling custom in Newengland?</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="023039_0125_0FBB9C9AF0FDC750"/>THEY are remarkably coy of strangers, and always marry among themselves; in consequence, the originality of their customs are preserved free from contam∣ination.</P>
<P>LATE in the afternoon returned to Sardan, and embarked immediately for Amsterdam, with upwards of one hun∣dred of us, crowded in, male and female, under the hatches: Soon after we left the shore, we were suddenly attacked by a thunder squall and heavy rain, so that our skipper was obliged to shut the hatches, which gave us all the same com∣plection, and opened a wide field for mer∣riment.</P>
<P>MY situation was so odd—wedged up between two Dutch lasses—in the dark —and standing all like sheep in a pen— as must have excited the mirth of the most phlegmatick Englishman. I felt
<PB N="129" REF="023039_0126_0FBB9C9C629CA050"/>
the full force of my situation, and it put me in a fine flow of spirits. In spite of the danger of dislocating my under jaw, I gagged out, by <HI>main force,</HI> a few Dutch words I had stolen, but so highly sea∣soned with English and French, that I could hardly make myself understood: However, as I always feel myself disposed to contribute to the merriment of the company when travelling, I endeavoured to make up, in gestures and laughing, what I was deficient in Dutch. The Dutch however, as I observed on another occasion, laugh with pain, and never without reason.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="day's events">
<HEAD>THURSDAY.</HEAD>
<P>DINED at my friend Myer's upon the Hier Graght, in company with several Americans—among the rest was the love∣ly Miss P—. After dinner we made a party and strolled through the best streets
<PB N="130" REF="023039_0127_0FBB9CA114E91E70"/>
of this wealthy city. We crossed the river Amstel, where we viewed with pleas∣ure a vast number of sluices, calculated to communicate the river and the Am∣sterdam canals; we viewed the river from a high bridge, which afforded an exten∣sive and pleasing prospect of the town, river, trees, sluices and trukschutes.</P>
<P>FINISHED the evening at a place called Vauxhall. We had coffee in a large room, filled with parties under cover of volumes of smoke. At the end of the room we were entertained by a company of French and Italian singers.</P>
<P>ON our return, being curious to see the amusements of a spillhouse, we were con∣ducted to the most celebrated one. But, my stars! what a scence!—I have never heard Amsterdam mentioned but these spillhouses were esteemed a principal cu∣riosity; they are licensed by the police for
<PB N="131" REF="023039_0128_0FBB9CA3312EA320"/>
the protection and safety of modest wom∣en—and are noted for the regulation they are under. I could not however endure the sight five minutes—my feelings were too sensibly attacked—the smoke was so thick, and the company so vulgar, that I was glad to decamp after having satisfied my curiosity. In entering we were oblig∣ed to pay for a bottle of <HI>vinegar,</HI> (called wine) whether we had it or not; and then we crowded through a gang of smoking jack tars, boors, and vulgar citizens, to the other end of the room; where I was much diverted to see a strapping negro fellow dancing a jig with one of the spill∣house ladies, and an old man playing upon a violin. The dancing was curi∣ous enough—they seemed to dance, or rather to slide, heavily upon their heels, scaling about the room, without the least order or animation. Indeed they seem∣ed to me like a couple of artificial ma∣chines set in motion.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="023039_0129_0FBB9CA4A27F5450"/>BUT alas! in casting my eyes about me, I was sickened to the soul with an idea that darted across my brain. There were about forty or fifty of these devoted wretches seated round the room—they looked like so many painted dolls, stuck up for sale: The scene carried with it an idea of entering a butcher's slaughter houses, where the calves and sheep are hung up for the highest bidder. Alas! poor human nature, how art thou fallen below the beasts of the field!—Enough of spillhouses.—Good night.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="day's events">
<HEAD>FRIDAY.</HEAD>
<P>CONTINUED viewing the city, and drop∣ped in at the rasphouse, so much talk∣ed of. It is in truth an excellent insti∣tution, but there is nothing in the build∣ing or discipline so very remarkable.— From the moment we entered until we left it, we were followed close, and stun∣ned
<PB N="133" REF="023039_0130_0FBB9CA8CA5510B8"/>
by the cries of charity! charity! From several of the windows they run out their naked arms—but in vain! as their punishments do not appear to be heavily inflicted.</P>
<P>THE method of rasping is nothing more than two men sawing lignum vitae with a rasp saw.</P>
<P>THEY have in Holland, I am told, another curious method of punishing criminals—who are confined at a pump, in a cistern of water up to their chins, which runs in as fast as they can pump it out; so that they are obliged to exert themselves until their strength is exhaust∣ed to prevent drowning. I believe this is the method taken to conquer the obsti∣nacy of those who refuse to labour.</P>
<P>DINED in company—the evening at the play.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="day's events">
<PB N="134" REF="023039_0131_0FBB9CA9ECAD4950"/>
<HEAD>SATURDAY.</HEAD>
<P>DINED at Mynheer Van S—ph—st's (a capital merchant) with a brilliant company, in the French style. Mum was the word two minutes before we at∣tacked the soup. In leaving the polite Dutchman's table, we paid our two flor∣ins to the servant at the door, as regu∣larly as at the table d' hôte in Paris. A most barbarous custom, which was exploded not many years since in Eng∣land, where it commonly cost a gentle∣man half a guinea to dine with <HI>his friend.</HI></P>
<P>☞ ON passent par une petite post du sallon á manger, dans la commodité. C'est pire que la France.</P>
<P>IN the evening I had the pleasure of gallanting <HI>la belle Americane</HI> to the French play, where the company was very bril∣iant—the beauty and majesty of her per∣son,
<PB N="135" REF="023039_0132_0FBB9CAF585F9020"/>
while it gratified my pride, drew the eyes of the Dutch ladies; and I thought I could read in them something like envy; they are however very elegant, both in their persons and manners, as they rise above the vulgar.</P>
<P>I HAVE more than once had occasion to remark, that the English authors are too apt to confine their remarks up∣on national characters, to the vulgar class of mankind, (as though they associ∣ated with no others;) which is extreme∣ly illiberal, and has a tendency to impress unfair ideas of a nation. In this respect the French are infinitely more liberal and good natured. When a Frenchman travels in England, he freely allows them <HI>all their merit.</HI> But how different is it with the English who travel in France? Sterne and Moore are almost the only English authors who have soared above the prejudices of their countrymen.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="023039_0133_0FBB9CB0C00F26E8"/>TO return—my fair countrywoman seemed to be the <HI>polar star</HI> when she rose between the scenes, as the rays of all eyes were centered upon her. Some Dutch ladies politely introduced them∣selves in a pleasing <HI>tête à tête</HI>; but I was under the agreeable necessity of officiating as interpreter in French, which I found was perfectly familiar to all around us.</P>
<P>FROM the play we closed the evening at another Vauxhall, in imitation of the one in London, on a small scale.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="day's events">
<HEAD>SUNDAY.</HEAD>
<P>SPENT this day mostly at my lodgings in writing and reflecting.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="day's events">
<HEAD>MONDAY.</HEAD>
<P>AT seven o'clock this morning I left Amsterdam, with two Americans, in com∣pany
<PB N="137" REF="023039_0134_0FBB9CB2FABB1860"/>
with Mr. F—, of the house of de la L—and F—, on our way to Haer∣lem, purposely to hear them play on the famous organ already described.</P>
<P>AS my life has been fertile in adven∣tures, I had a pleasing one in the line of gallantry in this excursion to add to the number. As soon as I had seated myself in the roof of the trukschute, a very fa∣cetious, sprightly Dutch lady came in, and seated herself directly opposite to me, with only a narrow table between.— Thus situated—inattention would have been too cold for a warm constitution— Her countenance expressed so much vi∣vacity that we soon found ourselves upon sociable terms—which in its progress af∣forded merriment for my brother travel∣lers quite to Haerlem—where I conduct∣ed her to her lodgings, and parted with regret.—The Dutch ladies seem as
<PB N="138" REF="023039_0135_0FBB9CB462923070"/>
much addicted to intrigue and gallantry as the French.</P>
<P>IN one hour I rejoined my companions at the church, and was charmed to hear this astonishing organ perform. The human voice is so admirably imitated, that I almost doubted the testimony of my own eyes and ears.</P>
<P>RETURNED in the afternoon in the body of a trukschute, full of passengers. Another thunder storm attacked us—we were obliged to drop our furled curtains and submit to darkness.—In this situa∣tion a singular incident happened, which first alarmed and afterwards diverted us extremely. A Dutch Jew in the boat had a peculiar talent of imitating the crying of a child to the nicest perfection, with an empty pipe, which he did as soon as the curtains were dropped—every one supposing a child in the canal, run their
<PB N="139" REF="023039_0136_0FBB9CB8B175E938"/>
heads out in the rain on all sides—the crying instantly ceased, and we hunted in the canal and in the boat in vain, for a child—This artifice was practised upon us several times before we detected the imposture. The old women, never at a loss for a cause, began to suspect the boat was haunted.</P>
<P>IN the morning I intend for Utrecht, and have it in contemplation to go from thence to Berlin, to see the immortal old Frederick. I must devote this evening to digest the materials I have collected relative to Amsterdam, its trade, &amp;c.</P>
<P>AMSTERDAM, the capital of the seven provinces, lays in lon. 4.30. E. and lat. 52.20. N. two hundred and thirty miles north east from Paris, and two hundred east from London, situated upon the river Wye, which empties into the Zuyder Zee. It contains, according to popular estima∣tion,

three hundred thousand souls, (I be∣lieve two hundred and fifty thousand) and twenty six thousand houses, equal to the number in Paris, and perhaps in general as large, though containing only half the number of inhabitants.</P>
<P>THIS city was hardly known in the thirteenth century, and owes its rise and grandeur to the deluge of inhabitants which poured into it from Antwerp in the civil wars.</P>
<P>IT is built in form of a crescent, and well fortified, with a strong wall and twenty six bastions, each of which have a windmill in their centre: The ditch is environed with a spacious canal, em∣bellished with a double row of trees. In the extent of their commerce it is thought they will not yield to London, though it is allowed to have been on the decline for many years; this copious sub∣ject

I shall enter more largely on in the ap∣pendix. Upwards of two thousand ships enter annually in the Wye from every quarter of the globe. The shallowness of the Zuyder Zee is a great obstacle in the way of dispatch; but on the other hand protects them effectually from naval ene∣mies. The city is built principally up∣on piles, at an enormous expense, which may be easily conceived when thirteen thousand were required for the founda∣tion of the stadthouse alone. The streets are generally wide and well paved, many of which have canals in the middle, with trees on each side; some of them are es∣teemed the finest in Europe. The squares are very mean, the most consid∣erable of which is the one the stadthouse is built on.</P>
<P>THIS is a noble structure, and the principal object in Amsterdam. It is two hundred and eighty two feet long, two

hundred and thirty five wide, and one hundred sixteen high, constructed with hewn stone, and is said to have cost two millions sterling. The armory, bank, bells, paintings, and burghers' hall, are the material objects; particularly the hall, which is one hundred and twenty feet long, fifty seven broad, and ninety high, all built with marble, which is really astonishing, when we consider that there is scarcely a native pebble to be seen in the whole country. The floor represents, in marble, the celestial and terrestrial globes, and the constellations in the heavens, most curiously inlaid.</P>
<P>THE houses are built, in general, of brick—some of hewn stone. The streets are not so clean, nor the houses so ele∣gant, in general, as those of Rotterdam; but the streets are well paved. All re∣ligions are tolerated—but Calvinism is by far the most extensive, and no other
<PB N="143" REF="023039_0140_0FBB9CC227B39AD0"/>
churches are allowed bells. The arsenal well merits seeing, as well as the dock yard, which lies contiguous to it, and is five hundred and eight feet long, and well supplied with naval stores.</P>
<P>THE air is strongly impregnated with noxious vapours, and the stench which rises from the canals. The water is bad; the best for common use is that which the clouds empty into their cisterns.</P>
<P>THE hospitals, and other charitable institutions, are very great, as they sup∣port upwards of twenty thousand poor in this way—but they do not hold a pro∣portion to the vast profusion the citizens of London bestow for these benevolent purposes, much to their honour.</P>
<P>THIS city is governed by a Senate of thirty six persons. Trumpeters are kept upon the steeples and towers in the

<HEAD>TUESDAY.</HEAD>
<P>AT six o'clock this cloudy morning I embarked on board the Utrecht truks∣chute, with a Mr. Vanbiber (an Ameri∣can gentleman) and a full freight of pas∣sengers, and in nine hours sailing we reached Utrecht. We sailed through a beautiful country, more abounding in elegant seats and summer houses, (be∣longing to the wealthy citizens of Am∣sterdam) than any part of Holland I have yet seen; especially within a few miles of Utrecht, where we saw a con∣tinued chain of them, some of which were mere palaces.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="023039_0142_0FBB9CC81620CF68"/>DINED at a Mr. Peterson's, a rich mer∣chant, and an American by birth. Af∣ter dinner he conducted us into every part of this city, which is built upon a natural elevation compared to the mari∣time cities. It lies twenty three miles S. E. from Amsterdam, is esteemed healthy, and rendered remarkable in his∣tory, for the celebrated treaty which ce∣mented the union of the Seven Provinces, in 1579.</P>
<P>IT contains from twenty to thirty thousand inhabitants—party spirit runs high among the citizens, who are arming, and exercising every day in opposition to the prince of Orange; whose party style it rebellion, and a French faction. The citizens are so inveterate against the English, that it is almost dangerous for one to be seen in the streets. Military distraction beats high in every vein; but nature and humanity shrink from the
<PB N="146" REF="023039_0143_0FBB9CCB03789490"/>
tragick thought, that these enchanting fields may be verging fast to the fatal change into parks of bellowing murder, encampments, and scenes of death, where family kindred may be darting the weap∣ons of destruction at each other.</P>
<P>VIEWED the old cathedral, the middle of which is blown down, but the tower is entire. Saw the monument of an old bishop, with fourteen others in <HI>basso re∣lievo,</HI> the heads of which were all batter∣ed to pieces, at the time of the violent re∣ligious persecution, which occasioned the revolt in the bloody reign of Philip II.</P>
<P>WE ascended the top of the tower, which is three hundred and seventy feet high, by four hundred and sixty steps; where we had a most sublime view of all the low country, the Downs, Haerlem lake, and Zuyder Zee; our horizon was rather hazy, which obstructed a much
<PB N="147" REF="023039_0144_0FBB9CCCAEF73568"/>
more extensive prospect. I am told that in a clear day, fifty walled cities may be comprehended in one view from this place.</P>
<P>THE country in the vicinity of Utrecht appeared like a continued garden. A chain of small hills and the Downs in some measure checked our view to the eastward. The wind blew a gale, and I was almost apprehensive that this crazy old tower, which has resisted sieges and tempests for near a thousand years, would at last tumble down and bury poor me in its ruins: The roaring of the winds through the hollow arches, and the ruins of the old church under us, naturally excited these vapours; so I hurried down to examine the university; after which I went to a famous garden, belonging to Madame Van Mollem, and adjoining to a silk machine, which is constructed nearly upon the same principles as the one I
<PB N="148" REF="023039_0145_0FBB9CD2981FF6E0"/>
saw at Derby in England, in 1782.— One water wheel (a curiosity in Holland) set the whole machine in motion.</P>
<P>THIS garden is upon a very large scale, and contains every object which can render a garden delightful and curious— such as cascades differently displayed, grottos, statues, vases, and a variety of imitations in evergreens, viz. baskets, &amp;c. &amp;c. in a very ingenious manner.</P>
<P>THE two grottos, the gardener tells us, cost ten thousand pounds sterling each, being mostly formed by a rare collection of shells from the different quarters of the globe. In this charming garden we spent a full hour, and could easily have found entertainment for a day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE Dutch are confessedly the best gardeners in Europe.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE antipathy between the English and the citizens of Utrecht, has subsisted

on the part of the English since the bar∣rier treaty made with Louis XIV, so ob∣noxious to them. On the part of the citizens, on account of the collusive con∣duct of the stadtholder in the late war with the English.</P>
<P>WE next viewed the mall, which is said to be the largest in Europe—It is three quarters of a mile in length, and formed by four double rows of stately trees.— When Louis XIV subdued, or rather took quiet possession of Utrecht, in 1672, he gave orders to protect this delightful promenade.</P>
<P>UTRECHT has no particular curiosi∣ties or elegant publick buildings; but the city is supposed to be larger than the Hague, though thinly peopled. Many of the houses are very elegant, and the pavements exceedingly neat and white.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>On board the Prince of Wales Packet, at sea, abreast of Helvoetsluys, <DATE>20th June, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE but this moment got on board, and am so much worn down with fatigue that I can scarcely stand. The wind now blows a complete gale, so I must improve the moment, or other∣wise I shall soon be too sick to tell you how I got along.</P>
<P>LAST evening, at eight o'clock, I em∣barked on board the Leyden trukschute at Utrecht, with a civil skipper, and, for the first time since I have been in Hol∣land,
<PB N="152" REF="023039_0149_0FBB9CDCF16562C0"/>
I found my French and English of no avail; of course I was obliged to pound Dutch with the Captain.</P>
<P>I HAD the cabin or roof all to myself, which I wished to avoid, as I feel a strong propensity to improve every mo∣ment in society; of which scarcely any sort can come amiss to one who travels for information.—Under this impression I left the cabin and entered upon the list of smokers in the body of the boat; but found no one disposed to be sociable with a poor fellow who had not a word to say for himself. So, finding my tongue useless, I returned again to my cabin, and spent the night upon cushions on the bench, sometimes viewing the coun∣try from the cabin windows by a fair moon light, and reading occasionally.</P>
<P>WE descended the canal as far as the town of Woerden, which is walled in—
<PB N="153" REF="023039_0150_0FBB9CE3252093E0"/>
here we entered a branch of the Rhine, and gave ourselves up to its gentle cur∣rent; and in this pleasing situation we continued descending the river, and pass∣ing many villages and a pleasant country, till we reached Leyden, at six o'clock in the morning. I found this new mode of travelling much more agreeable than on the canals, as the river is wider and the water continually alive. Besides, it was a sublime scene in the night to view the effect of the moon upon the country, through a double row of trees planted on the banks of the river.</P>
<P>I PASSED through the streets of Ley∣den, and immediately reembarked upon the Delft canal. Saw the burgeoise un∣der arms in the stadthouse. Since my last passing, the contending parties have had a small push in the bayonet way.— Unhappily the seeds of a civil war ap∣pear but too thickly scattered in this de∣lightful
<PB N="154" REF="023039_0151_0FBB9CE46414B990"/>
country. Heaven avert the im∣pending storm!</P>
<P>AT nine o'clock I arrived in Delft, but fearful of trusting to a trukschute passage, on account of their slow prog∣ress, I hired a man and chaise to drive me to Maeslandsluice. We rattled over the pavements, and then travelled upon the edge of the canal with great expedi∣tion, five miles, to Maeslandsluice, which I found a considerable town, built partly on an eminence, which I suppose is arti∣ficial. The harbour was full of fishing vessels; and though it is the residence chiefly of fishermen, it will vie, I am told, with almost any town in Holland, for neatness and pleasant streets, with canals, trees, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>HALF a mile farther I embarked on board a ferry boat—crossed the Maes in a gale—landed upon the little island
<PB N="155" REF="023039_0152_0FBB9CE6C032EF10"/>
Roosenburg—crossed the island in a cart —ferried again to the Brille—took a rattling waggon, and drove on seven miles through the mud, to Helvoetsluys— where I was immediately almost stunned with the cry of run! run! the packet is just weighing anchor▪ I flew to the commissary—paid twelve shillings and six pence for my pass (a villanous imposition by the way)—and the instant I arrived at the head of the quay the boat was pushing off into a boisterous sea. How∣ever, I tumbled on board—any how— and just saved myself to a hair—and shall now leave my journal, entirely beat out with fatigue. I will venture to pro∣nounce that there have been but few in∣stances of the same space of ground be∣ing measured in Holland, within the same space of time. Our passengers were astonished to find how expeditiously I flew across the country.—Adieu!</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>GEORGE INN, LONDON, <DATE>June 23, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not an hour since I ar∣rived, and you would laugh heartily to see what a figure I make. I left off my journal very sea sick—we had indeed a most unpleasant passage of twenty four hours, and a tumultuous head sea, which kept our packet dancing merrily upon the waves; but we miserable passengers were no otherwise sociable than in cascading <HI>en concert</HI> over our lee quarter, which we kept up sociably until the moment we landed on the coast of Suffolk. We fell
<PB N="157" REF="023039_0154_0FBB9CECD1481668"/>
in off Yarmouth, and sailed along the high coast of England, till abreast of Les∣tof, and then we embarked reluctantly, fourteen in number, on board of an open fishing boat, two miles from the shore, with a squally black atmosphere for our comfort. No consideration would have induced us to hazard such a risk but the misery of confinement, perhaps twen∣ty four hours longer, with the shore aboard.</P>
<P>WE landed in the surges beating upon the shore, and refreshed ourselves most comfortably—with a reviving dish of good tea to settle our giddy heads. I have frequently experienced, in different countries, the immediate good effects of this favourite herb, after a fatiguing day's journey, or sea sickness—It operates as effectual relief as opium in other cases. The French use tea as a medicine; the English, Dutch and Americans, by in∣fatuation,
<PB N="158" REF="023039_0155_0FBB9CEEE9466800"/>
on all occasions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I HAVE, in my travels, some where found a most excel∣lent substitute for coffee, in barley, ground and burnt in the same manner: Indeed I could hardly distinguish the differ∣ence in the taste, when sweetened previously to boiling.— Barley grows plentifully in Northamerica, and if this beverage should become prevalent there, it will not only save its inhabitants from the risk of a slow poison in the use of teas, but nearly half a million specie annually, within the United States.</NOTE>. Consump∣tions and bad teeth are commonly attrib∣uted to the excessive use of hot tea—with what justice I know not: But the fol∣lowing fact has reconciled me to that be∣lief—that consumptions are unknown in France, and their teeth are generally good —but in England, Holland and America consumptions are very prevalent; and the American women in particular are cursed with bad teeth for the most part, which I suppose may be partly owing to neglect as well as tea. A fine set of teeth preserves in old age the appearance of youth.</P>
<P>WE immediately prepared for London, but for the want of a better convey∣ance,
<PB N="159" REF="023039_0156_0FBB9CF066C53F48"/>
we were obliged to travel in a com∣mon horse cart twenty five miles, across the country to Sexmundy, like so many condemned criminals on their way to Tyburn. The situation was indeed en∣tirely novel, and pleased us of course; but we were frequently incommoded by the rain, as well as by the ridicule of the country people.</P>
<P>FOR my part, as I had scarcely been in bed since leaving Haerlem, and my eyes were fairly swelled for want of sleep, I determined to enjoy this night undis∣turbed; for which purpose I prevailed on one of my fellow travellers to bear me company; but notwithstanding our endeavours to refresh the claims of na∣ture, a crazy young landlord burst into our room before midnight, wild—and frantick.—We cursed his impudence most cordially, but were too much out of hu∣mour to attempt a second sleep, and
<PB N="160" REF="023039_0157_0FBB9CF40F2D8F20"/>
consequently we immediately set off for Ipswich, where we arrived just at the dawn of day.</P>
<P>THE town appeared to us large, but the houses small, and every object ex∣ceedingly flat and dirty, after leaving the magnificent and clean streets of the Dutch cities.</P>
<P>WE took in two or three brisk young widows who accompanied us to Colches∣ter. We have had a fine day, and al∣lowing for the heaviness of our leaden eyes, were as merry as we could wish.</P>
<P>I SHALL now sum up with some gen∣eral observations respecting the Unit∣ed Provinces at large, and their com∣merce, with a short sketch of each prov∣ince in particular, which will complete my tour to that country; and I think you will do me the justice to confess I

<HEAD>ORIGIN and DESCRIPTION OF THE <HI>UNITED PROVINCES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HOLLAND belonged origin∣ally to the house of Burgundy, and fell under that of Austria, which united it to the Spanish crown, by the succession of Charles V, to that throne. The bigot∣ted and bloody persecutions of his son Philip II, produced a revolt in the seven∣teen provinces, ten of which returned to their allegiance; and the present United Provinces pursued their opposition (with a degree of bravery and perseverance that
<PB N="163" REF="023039_0160_0FBB9CFAF94AEA78"/>
reflects honour on human nature) until the year 1648, when they were declared independent, after a glorious struggle of seventy six bloody years, valiantly fight∣ing through four succeeding generations, for every blessing of civil and religious liberty, dear to mankind. The vast pos∣sessions they had wrested from the Portu∣guese in the Eastindies, either by fraud or by force, enabled them to contend with success against Spanish gold, and two of the most powerful monarchs in Europe.</P>
<P>THE Seven Provinces, which compose this formidable republick, the wonder and admiration of the world—are Hol∣land, Zealand, Friesland, Guelderland, Overyssel, Groningen and Utrecht.— They extend about one hundred and fifty miles each way, including the Zuyder Zee and Haerlem lake; which, taken with their rivers, and numerous canals, leaves a doubt which of the elements,
<PB N="164" REF="023039_0161_0FBB9CFDBAA28368"/>
land or water, occupies the greatest space within this area, which embraces, by a late calculation, nine thousand one hun∣dred and forty square miles. The Maes and the Rhine are the principal rivers.</P>
<P>TRAVELLING is cheaper in Holland than in any other country, as it does not exceed one penny sterling per mile in the trukschutes, exclusive of baggage.</P>
<P>THE face of the earth lying level, and often lower than the surface of the sea, naturally leads a stranger to imagine that the whole country has escaped by acci∣dent the dominion of the ocean, which will apparently sooner or later reassume its prerogative, of which their history furnishes many frightful examples; in particular the fatal inundation, already mentioned, in 1421.</P>
<P>THE heaviness of this foggy and moist atmosphere is undoubtedly unhealthy:
<PB N="165" REF="023039_0162_0FBB9CFEAA26FC30"/>
And it is from this circumstance that their slovenly neighbours wish to rob them of the merit of their excessive neatness, as they say (and perhaps with some reason) that it is a merit of necessity to have their houses painted, and every thing around them clean and bright.</P>
<P>THEIR winters begin in October and end in March. The summers are often very hot, short, and subject to frequent changes. The number of inhabitants varies extremely in the popular estima∣tion; but from the best information they do not exceed two millions and an half, which are evidently on the decline, ow∣ing to a variety of concurrent circum∣stances. The two principal causes, it is supposed, arise from the insensible decline of manufactures, and consequently of commerce—with the increase of luxury, and a great degeneracy from their virtu∣ous ancestors, who procured them their
<PB N="166" REF="023039_0163_0FBB9D02F4AC11E0"/>
independence, and left the government established upon the broad basis of jus∣tice, industry, enterprise, and frugality.</P>
<P>THOSE who pretend to pry deep into futurity, predict their total annihilation as an independent power. It is at least evident that their vast and rich possessions in the Eastindies, will eventually produce the same effect upon Holland, as the gold mines of Southamerica have upon Spain —I mean national debility, corruption, loss of manufactures, and consequently poverty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEVERAL nations of Europe now manufacture the arti∣cles they formerly received from the Dutch, particularly the English.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SHOULD the Emperor persevere in his wise and ambitious plan of opening the Scheld, and reviving the commerce of Antwerp (once the emporium and glory of Europe) it will most certainly tend to accelerate their rapid decline. The Scheld
<PB N="167" REF="023039_0164_0FBB9D041E9A2310"/>
is a noble river, and will admit ships of any burthen quite up to the city, which is very easy of access from the North Sea, and has a communication with the Rhine, Maes, and Lis. In this case a doubt cannot be entertained but Antwerp would rapidly rise to its former splendour, and soon be crowded with commercial adven∣turers from all quarters of Europe, and even from Holland itself, as Germany will open a wide field for enterprise. As Am∣sterdam rose on the ruins of Antwerp, so it is probable that Antwerp would on those of Amsterdam, and perhaps almost resume its former rank among the cities of Europe, were once the Scheld opened.</P>
<P>THE main springs of the Dutch wealth in the Eastindies, is the monopoly of the spice trade, in which they are in some danger of meeting rivals, notwithstand∣ing all their art and industry to pre∣vent it.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="023039_0165_0FBB9D05A23AD140"/>IT is said that in the garden of the king of France, in the Isle of France, they have raised 10,000 weight of cinnamon, and 30,000 weight of cloves, besides oth∣er spices. This secret was stolen from Ceylon, Amboyna, and Banda, by some French merchants.</P>
<P>THE canals in Holland are so much frequented that the roads are neglected, and in general very bad, but mostly lined with trees, barriers, and turnpikes at short distances.</P>
<P>THERE are no regular post coaches— consequently every one is subject to the imposition of the waggoners.</P>
<P>THIS country is curious because it re∣sembles no other; but a continued uni∣formity soon cloys a traveller, though the objects are pleasing, and keep his mind continually alive. In general, after see∣ing
<PB N="169" REF="023039_0166_0FBB9D0816AC88F0"/>
one town you have seen the rest.— The country without their walls holds to the same general symmetry; a continued marshy plain covered with cattle. The principal lands are devoted to gardens and pastures.</P>
<P>THE Dutch in high life are a type of the French. Their merchants, and those who rank in this standing, are certainly more graceful and easy in their address than the English of the same class; but as a nation, they may be considered as a dull, cold, distant and inhospitable peo∣ple, especially to foreigners, unless rec∣ommended in warm terms.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of province">

<P>THIS is the principal state, both in riches and extent, being one hundred

miles in length, and thirty wide. It is divided into North and Southholland, by the river Wye, which does not keep them separate a great distance; but their cus∣toms and style of life are very opposite.</P>
<P>HOLLAND is entirely flat, except the Downs along the sea coast, and the soil is rather light.</P>
<P>IN November, particularly in North∣holland, the country is totally buried in water; so that no other objects present to view but dikes, steeples and houses, rising out of the sea. In this season the inhabitants are, to all intents, in the sit∣uation of amphibious animals emerging out of water. These inundations fatten the fields, and are drawn off again in February in a most curious manner, by mills invented for the purpose. The country is protected from the common rake of the sea, by dikes and the Downs.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="023039_0168_0FBB9D0C2384A6C0"/>THEY have no arable lands, but plen∣ty of fruit. The meadows afford fine grazing for vast flocks of cattle which cover them. Holland is indeed a con∣tinued meadow, intersected with canals, lakes and rivers, which are well stored with fish.</P>
<P>THEIR foreign trade knows no bounds upon the globe. They have no grain of their own culture, but are the granary of Europe; no vineyards, but they sup∣ply Europe with the best of wines; no staple, but they have every thing in their ports, cheaper, often, than any other na∣tion. Such are the happy effects of in∣dustry and enterprise.—But, alas! poor Holland, thy sun has passed its meridian, and, as in a long summer's day, it edges slowly to the horizon.—In point of strength and riches, they equal the oth∣er six provinces—and as manufactures decline, and land continues high, the

It is astonishing that so enterprising a nation as the English, should suffer their great rivals in wealth and commerce to wrest from them this vast source of riches, on their own coasts, and under their very noses.

<HEAD>OVERYSSEL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the poorest province in the union. It contains nineteen cities and seventy nine villages. It is situated north from the Zuyder Zee, joining to Fries∣land. It is sixty miles long, and forty wide; low and marshy. They raise plen∣ty of cattle, but it is badly peopled.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="description of province">
<HEAD>GELDERLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THIS province is bounded by the Zuy∣der Zee on the north, and Groningen on the south. It is sixty miles long, and fifty wide. The air is better than in the maritime provinces; and the soil is grav∣elly, rising into young hills. They make vast quantities of paper by the assistance of two hundred mills. They raise also
<PB N="177" REF="023039_0174_0FBB9D1E505E5A78"/>
considerable quantities of tobacco of an inferiour quality.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="description of province">
<HEAD>UTRECHT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS province is bounded by Holland and the Zuyder Zee on the north, and by Gelderland on the east. It is twenty five miles long, and as many wide. U∣trecht is the capital. The land is high, and healthy of course—and instead of meadows, terra firma. It contains five cities, and sixty five villages. They raise also some tobacco.</P>

<HEAD>GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>EACH province is independent of the rest, and many cities independent of the
<PB N="178" REF="023039_0175_0FBB9D2148E73878"/>
province they are in; which of course produces a very complicated system of government.</P>
<P>THEIR High Mightinesses can neither make war or peace, nor form alliances, without the consent of every state which sends deputies to the grand assembly, in which the people are unequally rep∣resented. For example, Overyssel holds the same voice as Holland, which last pays half the expense of the union; and the small city of Purmeren the same as Amsterdam, which again pays half the charges of Holland. The nobility are not numerous—the states assemble at the Hague four times a year; but in cases of emergency they are called together by the council of state, which resides at the Hague.</P>
<P>ONE negative voice frustrates a decision upon any important point, which often
<PB N="179" REF="023039_0176_0FBB9D22A57756D0"/>
occasions a most tedious procrastination, and eternally clogs the wheels of publick operations. Hence arose their slow and feeble efforts in the last war with Eng∣land.</P>
<P>THE chamber of accounts conducts the revenue of Holland, which is gener∣ally entrusted in the hands of old per∣sons, who have stood the test of fidelity by their long services. The states gen∣eral is composed of thirty four members, of which Gelderland sends six, Holland four, Zealand four, Utrecht four, Fries∣land five, Overyssel five, and Groningen six. No stadtholder, governour, or offi∣cer can vote in the national assembly.— They change their president every week, each province supplying him in its turn. In common cases the majority of votes decide; but in extraordinary cases they must be unanimous.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="023039_0177_0FBB9D243AB023B0"/>THERE are five courts of admiralty, or colleges, in the different ports, which di∣rect the naval operations subject to the instructions of the assembly.</P>
<P>THE power of the stadtholder is noth∣ing more than generalissimo and high ad∣miral, subservient to their high mighti∣nesses' direction.</P>
<P>THE legislative authority of every city is lodged in a senate of twenty or thirty persons, who hold it for life, and the survivors at the death of one member, choose another in his place. The repre∣sentatives of the several provinces are chosen out of this body; so, in fact, the people (with all their boastings of liberty) have no hand in electing the persons by whom they are governed so despotically.</P>
<P>I AM afraid we shall realize under our confederated system in America, all
<PB N="181" REF="023039_0178_0FBB9D2666DB3848"/>
the inconveniences the Dutch experi∣ence under their ill modelled government, which seems to partake of the most scru∣pulous jealousy in its origin, as well as clear despotism in its operation. While we were under the incumbent pressure of a common enemy, our temporary gov∣ernment answered all the purposes for which it was created; but now that weight is removed, every state will draw into itself, and, like the sensitive plant, shrink from the representative body of the union. Our confederation possesses many of the defects, without any of the coercion or energy of the Dutch govern∣ment. God only knows what will be the event; but I dread to look forward, from a full conviction that we cannot long be bound together by such feeble ties. State will contend against state— hatred will ensue—and perhaps the whole continent will be again deluged with the blood of—Americans—while it is yet
<PB N="182" REF="023039_0179_0FBB9D2AB929B678"/>
smoking with the blood of Englishmen and Americans; and finally we shall be∣come an easy prey to some power of Europe—or some bold Cromwell will step forward to give us despotick law and protection. But I will not, I cannot in∣dulge such a gloomy anticipation; but rather will hope that the fond expectation of the admiring world may not be so soon blasted, and that that Providence which has carried us so gloriously through the revolution, will unite the wisdom of the continent to devise a form of government which will bless this and future genera∣tions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE reader will remember that this was written before the federal constitution, by which the United States are now governed, was thought of.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE ardent glow of affection I feel for America has led me into a digression: Indeed I find the <HI>amor patria</HI> is always the most powerful when at the greatest distance from our native soil.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="023039_0180_0FBB9D2C566546C0"/>TO return—The revenue of Holland amounts to about twenty one millions of florins per annum, which arises prin∣cipally on the excise, customs, and what is levied upon the conquered towns in Flanders. The excise duties are so ex∣tended as to reach every article. Upon any close emergency they have recourse to the hundredth penny.</P>
<P>THEIR forces consist of upwards of sev∣enty sail of men of war of all sizes, and thirty thousand troops. Their greatest security, however, lies in their peculiar situation. Their forces are composed chiefly of foreigners.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>I AM indebted to a very pry∣ing and sensible English gentleman for the following remarks on the Dutch East-india affairs. This gentleman resided some time in that country, and was at the source of the best information. He says,</P>
<P>THE original stock of the Dutch East-india company consisted of 2,100 shares, at 3,000 florins <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">EACH florin of Holland, according to the par of silver, is worth 1s. 10d. sterling nearly—but the course of exchange varies according to the fluctuation of trade, &amp;c.</NOTE> each, amounting in the whole to 6,300,000 florins: They after∣wards increased the number of shares to 2,130, of the same value—which advanc∣ed their capital to 6,390,000 florins.</P>
<P>THEIR singular good fortune in step∣ping, without loss or expense, into all the Portuguese settlements and fortifica∣tions
<PB N="186" REF="023039_0182_0FBB9D2EAE84BCB8"/>
in Asia, except Goa and Daman; the rich prizes made of Portuguese ships; the justice rendered by their agents abroad to their constitutents at home; and the enormous advantages arising from their unconscionable oppressive treaties with the princes of Java and Ceylon, together with the superiour influence which the entire property of cinnamon, cloves, mace, nutmegs, and two third parts of the pep∣per trade in India, have indispensably yielded to them in Asia, at one time rais∣ed the value of their stock to 650 per cent. thus increasing their capital of 6,300,000, to 40,950,000 florins. From this magnitude, avarice, and an ill judged severity exercised over their allies or de∣pendents, and a false parade of dignity in Batavia, &amp;c. exceeding that of any crown∣ed head in Europe, have reduced their stock, which is now only from 340 to 355 per cent. A still delusive and per∣nicious estimation, which by dividing the
<PB N="187" REF="023039_0183_0FBB9D302387C3A0"/>
principal instead of the profits, together with various other concurring circum∣stances, must at length lay them pros∣trate as bankrupts and delinquents, at the feet of the states general, who will then be as little capable of sustaining them as of upholding their own credit.</P>
<P>THE 23,000,000 florins expended in the establishment of the Cape of Good Hope, of which 10,000,000 florins may moderately be stated as an irretrievable loss; the 15,250,000 florins added to the real commercial and moveable capital 13,500,000 florins, fully accounts for the former rise of their original capital to 650 per cent. and at the same instant avows that in proportions considerably less of∣fensive than those which have either en∣hanced their expenses or reduced their profits, their destruction is inevitable if they do not wisely and speedily adopt the only rational means of evading it.</P>
