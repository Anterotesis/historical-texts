<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SOON after the commencement of the late Malig∣nant Fever in our city, a short account of which is now laid before the Public, two of my particular friends were seized with all its symptoms. On them, I thought it my duty to attend, that I might render such assistance as lay in my power. A few days after the disease began to spread its direful influence in the vicinity of my place of residence, and I resolved to pay the same attention to my neighbours as I was willing to do to my friends. For this resolution, however, I claim no merit; For as the situation of my family was such as to render it improper, at least inconvenient to move, and finding myself sur∣rounded with pestilence, I firmly believed, that I was equally safe, while performing the common duties of hu∣manity, to the afflicted, as sitting useless in my own ap∣partment; nay more, had I remained inactive, my mind might have become a prey to melancholy, and I should, in all probability, have been oppressed with fear, than which there is not a greater predisponent cause to disor∣der, nor perhaps an equal cause in making its termina∣tion fatal. Reasoning in this manner, and trusting in Divine Providence for protection, I therefore determi∣ned to make no hesitation in visiting any sick person to whom I could be useful.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="035586_0003_1005F5D839B61028"/>
On the 1st September, the Health Commissioners having heard that I was not afraid of seeing the infected, wished me to enter into their service. I agreed, and from that day continued employed by them, and after∣wards by the Health Committee, till the termination of the disease.</P>
<P>In this situation, I had daily opportunities of seeing the progress of the fever, the treatment of the sick, the manner in which the poor were relieved, &amp;c. and as the Magistrates were so obliging as to permit me to have recourse to their papers for information with respect to the donations, and the names of the dead, I was induced to venture on the present publication.</P>
<P>My aim, in every page, has been truth and accura∣cy, without embellishment. How far I have succeed∣ed, I cannot at present determine; but of this I am cer∣tain, I meant well, and have used my utmost endeavour to render the work as satisfactory to the public, as pos∣sible.</P>

AN ACCOUNT OF THE MALIGNANT FEVER, LATETY PREVALENT IN NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<DIV1 N="1" TYPE="part">
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>State of NEW-YORK, previous to the commencement of the Malignant Fever.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN, in the month of July last, the public prints announced, that a pestilential fever had made its appear∣ance in Philadelphia, the inhabitants of this city, received the information with sorrow. They felt for the distresses of their fellow-creatures, whilst at the same time, they little thought, that a calamity of a similar nature was impending over themselves. Our city was at that time represented, and I believe, with truth, to be remarkably healthy. The greatest attention was paid to cleaning our streets, and the Health Physician was vigilant in the discharge of his duty. Hence as we apprehended no danger from the importation of pestilence, much less did we think that it could be en∣gendered amongst ourselves. Our citizens in this state of supposed security, were chiefly bent on making prepara∣tions to defend their liberty and independence against the aggressions of a foreign foe.</P>
<P>For this purpose military associations were rapidly form∣ed; companies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, compo∣sed of citizens of every age and situation in life, daily pa∣raded to acquire the necessary knowledge of the art of war; whilst others were personally engaged in erecting fortifications at the battery, that we might be enabled to defend ourselves against the attacks of any invaders. Sub∣scriptions, likewise, were raised to a great amount, for the
<PB N="6" REF="035586_0005_1005F5DE35373310"/>
purpose of building vessels of war, to guard our coast and protect our commerce.</P>
<P>But in the midst of these mighty preparations, an enemy more terrible than any foreign nation, made its appearance and spread havoc and destruction in every direction. I mean the <HI>Yellow Fever.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the approach of this awful disorder, the bustle we were making for self-defence was suddenly suspended; the warlike looks, which our citizens had assumed, changed in∣to those of dismay; the fortifications in a great measure neglected; the military associations discontinued, and death, speedy death, seemed to be the indiscriminate por∣tion of the inhabitants of this wealthy metropolis; for as it is well described in one of our public prints, "parents and children, husbands and wives, brothers and sisters were suddenly torn from the feeling bosoms of their rela∣tives, while the mourning survivors were themselves mo∣mentarily expecting the solemn call: The lisping infant calling for its dead parents; and none but strangers to af∣ford relief; houses totally emptied of their inhabitants, and the citizens flying in every direction from the infected places, as from a conflagrated town, or falling tower; the constant hearse in sable melancholy, conveying the victims of this direful calamity to their long home, and whole fa∣milies in many instances cut off without a single individual being Jest." Many women who enjoyed ease and afflu∣ence, are bereft of their husbands, and left to struggle for the maintainance of numerous families of children, a task for which they are but little qualified, and many orphans deprived of their parents, must be brought up at the public expence; Divine Providence thus affording us an awful lesson of the instability of human affairs, and teaching us, if we are not incorrigible, how ineffectual the exertions of men are, unless they be forwarded by the Deity. By this remark, however, I would by no means be understood as insinuating, that the measures we were adopting for the protection of our lives and property, and of our wives and children, were improper; on the contrary, I think it was the duty of every good citizen, to exert himself to the utmost on such an emergency; but I shall certainly be excused for making this observation, that when we are threatened with dangers of whatever nature, whilst we en∣deavour
<PB N="7" REF="035586_0006_1005F5DFC93FEF68"/>
by every means in our power to avert them, we should depend for success not on our own exertions, but on the blessing of Heaven.</P>
<P>Having made these prefatory remarks, I shall now proceed to the melancholy subject I have undertaken, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the history of a pestilential disorder, which, though it has at different times appeared in this city, particularly i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the year 1795, was never productive of half the calamity as in the months of August, September, and October, in the year 1798.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>First appearance of the disorder—its progress and decline. Opinions concerning it various and contradictory.</HEAD>
<P>THE malignant Fever which committed so dreadful ha∣voc amongst the inhabitants of New-York, made its ap∣pearance towards the end of July. Its first victim, in all probability, was Mr. Melancton Smith, who died on the 28th or 29th of that month, after an illness of a very few days. His case was said to be attended with the most malignant symptoms; but such was the general opinion of the inhabitants with respect to the healthiness of our city, that his death excited little or no alarm. Mr. Smith is said to have been taken sick at his store, in Front street near Coenties-slip, and a few days after his death, several persons were attacked with sickness in that vicinity. The symptoms of their disorder, however, in general appear∣ed to be similar to that of a <HI>common cold:</HI> they were, therefore, negligent in obtaining medical aid; hence the disease got the ascendency before they were aware of their danger, and the assistance of physicians was procured too late. From what has come under my own observation, with respect to this disorder, I consider it to be highly proper for every individual, upon its appearance, to send for a skillful physician the <HI>moment</HI> he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s him∣self taken with any sort of sickness; for the <HI>Yellow-Fever,</HI> in its attacks, is peculiarly insidious; it assumes a variety of forms, and often that of a <HI>common cold,</HI> or some slight distemper, for which most people would think there was no necessity for seeking a remedy.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="035586_0007_1005F5E265567CA8"/>
Indeed, according to Doctor Rush, of Philadelphia, when a particular epidemic visits any spot, every other complaint is at once absorbed, or lost with the then raging sickness. This, I apprehend, is now the general opinion of our most eminent physicians; and had it been generally believed by the inhabitants of New-York, I am almost convinced that the havoc in our city would have by no means been so great as it was; for I have little doubt that more than one half of those to whom the disorder proved fatal, might in all probability have been now in good health, had they, on the first attack, applied the proper remedies; and should this, or any other city in the Uni∣ted States, be again afflicted by a similar calamity, (which God forbid) as a friend to my fellow citizens, I would use my utmost endeavours, in pressing this truth upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inds, that in such a situation, <HI>delays are peculiarly dangerous</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the progress of the distemper.—</P>
<P>Whether any cases of pestilential fever existed in the earlier part of August, remote from the place where it was believed to have originated, I have not been able to ascertain: But of this I am certain, that about the 20th of the month, cases of a highly malignant nature appear∣ed in various parts of the city, and in particular it began to range with great violence at the New Slip, in Cliff-street and John-street, but more especially in Eden's-Alley and Rider-street, where not a family escaped it, nor was there a house in which it made its appearance, except two, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that of Mr. M'Masters and me, where it did not termi∣nate fatally to one or more individuals. About the same time it likewise spread its ravages in Ann-street, Fair-street, Cherry-street, Augustus-street, and also at the ship yards, and about the beginning of September, I know of few places in the city where there were not some solitary cases.</P>
<P>Our Health-Commissioners began to be somewhat ap∣prehensive with regard to the appearance of this pestilence so early as the 6th of August, as may be seen from the following letter addressed to the Mayor:—</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE unfinished situation of the docks in Front-street, between Coenties and the Old-slip, generally, was, in the opinion of the Commissioners of the Health-Office, a source of disease in that neighbourhood last year, and oc∣casioned the death of several valuable citizens. At that period it became a subject of remonstrance to the Com∣mon Council.</P>
<P>The Commissioners cannot sufficiently regret, that they have reason to renew their remonstrances on this subject, and that its present situation is likely to be productive of still greater evils than those of last year.</P>
<P>Several persons have sickened in the neighbourhood of these unfinished grounds within a week, and with symp∣toms strikingly characteristic of Yellow-Fever.</P>
<P>If the Common Council think proper to appoint two of their members, the Commissioners will meet them early to-morrow-morning, to concert measures adapted to the exigency of the case.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am respectfully, Sir, Your most obedient servant, RICHARD BAYLEY, <HI>Health-Officer.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>On the same day they issued an advertisement, notifying their determination to put the laws in force with respect to those who should be delinquent in regard to keeping the streets clean, before their respective doors, and in remov∣ing dirt from their yards and cellars, adding that the street inspectors, whose immediate duty it was to attend to that business, were directed to report all offences of this nature to the police, and that the penalty against offenders would be rigidly exacted.</P>
<P>At the time of this advertisement, however, it was re∣marked both by citizens and strangers, that our streets were kept uncommonly clean; but with respect to yards and cellars, I have reason to believe that, to the disgrace of some individuals, it was in some cases otherwise;—and I may add, that where such nuisances have existed, the in∣habitants
<PB N="10" REF="035586_0009_1005F5E6DBE2DEC8"/>
of that vicinity have generally been the severest sufferers.</P>
<P>By some people our Commissioners have been censured for neglecting to notify the citizens <HI>officially</HI> of the danger to which they were exposed, so soon as they became ac∣quainted with the existence of any malignant or pesti∣lential fever in the city. Such censure, however, ap∣pears, to me to be very unjust: for the existence of some cases of fever was universally known towards the middle of August, and became the subject of general con∣versation. The Commissioners never denied it, nor did they attempt to conceal it: But as it was the opinion of most people, that it was not probable the disorder would spread, and that it would vanish after sacrificing a few indi∣viduals, as had happened in the years 1796 and 1797, such a publication, whilst it could have been of no use to the inhabitants, who were well acquainted with their situation, might have been highly prejudicial to our commerce, by deterring country people from coming amongst them, at a time, when according to every appearance, they could pass and repass to our city in perfect safety, and without running any risque of receiving infection.</P>
<P>On the 12th, 13th, and 14th of August, there was heavy showers of rain; that on the 14th, commenced at four in in the morning, and continued without the least intermis∣sion, until nine with considerable thunder: The quantity which fell during these five hours, was supposed to be greater than had at any time fallen, during the same space of time for many years. The streets were covered with water, in many places knee deep, and a vast number of cellars were filled with it.</P>
<P>It was at the time, generally believed, that this excessive rain and thunder would so purify the air, that our city would in a few days be totally exempt from any cases of the disorder, but alas! our expectations in this respect, were dreadfully disappointed: for from this day, it almost immediately began to spread in every direction. But, however erroneous, the ideas of many have been with respect to this circumstance, severals thought very differ∣ently; in particular, a writer in the Commercial Adverti∣ser, on the evening of the 14th, the day on which this excessive rain fell, who seems to have foreseen what would
<PB N="11" REF="035586_0010_1005F5E88446DD28"/>
been the true consequences of it. His language is so re∣markable that I cannot forbear to quote it. "The im∣mense bodies of water" says he, "which have lately fallen, whilst it seems to cleanse the streets, should excite a degree of serious alarm, when the effects of its remaining stagnant is considered. Many cellars must no doubt have been the receptacle for much of the rain which has fallen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ it therefore behoves every person, <HI>without delay,</HI> to examine their cell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs and other places, which are likely to become reservoirs of water, and should any be found, immediate steps should be taken to remove it. Stagnant water in confined places, during this hot weather, will, in two days, exhale a pestilent water, which may generate the most dangerous infectious disorders, to prevent which, af∣ter the removal of the water, a liberal use of lime should be made by scattering it over the cellar. It is to be hoped that a regard to self-preservation will produce the most prompt and active exertions towards this alarming object; those who neglect it, will be amongst the first victims of a ravaging disease, which a little timely attention might have kept from our at present healthy city-"</P>
<P>A day or two after, in the same paper, a writer, after mentioning the late floods of water, observes, that▪ "If immediate and vigorous measures are not taken to oblige people to have their cellars emptied and well ventilated and dried, one week will produce in this city, a more malignant sickness than Philadelphia now experiences, or than New-York has witnessed since its first settlement."</P>
<P>My intention in quoting these extracts, is to put our ci∣tizens on guard against an indolent security, should we be again attacked by the Yellow-Fever: For heat and mois∣ture combined will ever produce putrid vapours, and these, from the earliest ages of physic, have been almost universally allowed to be the source of pestilential dis∣orders.</P>
<P>Our Health-Commissioners, on this occasion, certain∣ly deserved well of the public. Their u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>most endeavours were exerted to have every nuisance removed, and as far as lay in their power, to prevent the spreading of the dis∣ease, with which we then began to be afflicted. Their en∣deavours, however, were ineffectual, as the number of deaths from this time almost daily encreased.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="035586_0011_1005F5EAD928FAA0"/>
About the 24th numbers began to leave the city, and many of those who had offices for the transaction of busi∣ness in that part of the city which lies toward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the East Ri∣ver, moved to Broadway, which was deemed more heal∣thy. The Custom-House, likewise, in Mill-street, and the Insurance-Office in Water-street, were fixed for the time in the Tontine-City-Tavern, in Broadway. During the whole month of August, the number of deaths amount∣ed to one hundred and thirty three men, fifty five women, and one hundred and forty one children, making in all three hundred and twenty nine. As particular attention had not been hitherto paid by the sextons to distinguish those who fell victims to the fever, from those who had died of any other disorder, it is difficult to ascertain their p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecise numbers. Perhaps, if it be fixed at one hundred, we shall not be far from the truth, particularly as it is certain that by far the greatest number of the children were cut off by the flux, a disorder which generally proves fa∣tal to infants at this season of the year. On the 15th Au∣gust the deaths were 14, from which day the number was still progressing, so that on the 1st September, they amount-to 23. The daily average during August was about 12.</P>
<P>On the 15th of Sept. the number of funerals were 38, on the awful 19th, they were no less than 63, and on each of the two days following, they were reduced to 40, from which circumstance we began to entertain hopes that our mortal foe was about to leave us, but we were again dis∣appointed, for the next four days it kept fluctuating be∣tween 41 and 50, and on the 26th <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose up to 60. The total number of deaths, during this month, was eleven hundred and fifty two, of whom nine hundred and fifty four died of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever. Six hundred and forty eight, were men, three hundred and fifty four women, and and one hundred and fifty two children. The daily average thro' the month was about 38. By the 15th of this month, our situation was known at a distance, as on that day a procla∣mation was issued by James Cahoun, esqr Mayor of Bal∣timore, prohibiting the entrance into the city of Baltimore or within three miles thereof, of all persons whomsoever, who had come from the cities of New-York or Philadel∣phia, or from Wilmington in the state of Delaware, and forbidding the citizens of Baltimore from having any
<PB N="13" REF="035586_0012_1005F5EDD2881078"/>
communication with them, until they could produce an ap∣proved certificate of their absence from those places at least 15 days previous thereto.</P>
<P>Our number of dead on the 1st October was 43, and this was the greatest number during the whole month. On the 18th it was reduced to 16, and on the 21st it only a∣mounted to 9. After this, the number of deaths on any one day during the existence of the calamity, did not ex∣ceed 15, and it is certain that had our absent citizens at∣tended to the advice of the Health-Committee, as pub∣lished in the different newspapers about this time, dissuad∣ing them from a premature return, the death warrant of the disorder might have been dated from about this day; but it is greatly to be regretted, that numbers of our valuable citizens, by not attending to this admonition, are now tenants of the grave, who, had they only remain∣ed till after the frost, which took place in the latter end of October and beginning of November, might have now, very probably, been in good health. The whole number of funerals for October, was five hundred and twenty two, two hundred and nine of whom were men, one hundred and fifty eight women, and seventy four children. Of these four hundred and thirty one died of fever. The average of the deaths, during this month, was about 17. On the 10th November, the deaths were only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and on each of the preceding days, they were only 4. The total number during these 10 days, were 83, of whom 41 were men, twenty two women, and twenty children. Of these thirty nine died of the fever; the daily average was about 8. The following address of the Committee now made its appearance in all the newspapers:—</P>
<P>"The Health-Committee for the relief of the sick and indigent in the city of New-York, beg leave to congratu∣late their fellow-citizens, that under Divine Providence, this long afflicted city is once more restored to its usual state of general health, and with the most heartfelt plea∣sure inform those who yet remain in exile, that although a few cases of the pestilential fever exists, yet that by the late cold weather and frost, the contagion is so far destroy∣ed as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ender the return of their families to the city per∣fectly safe, provided they take the necessary previous mea∣sures of cleansing and ventilating their long unaired dwel∣lings,
<PB N="14" REF="035586_0013_1005F5F00ABFD4C0"/>
and purifying the bedding and clothing which may have been left therein during the prevalence of the fever.</P>
<P>It would have afforded the Committee much satisfaction could they have given this invitation at an earlier period, but they did not conceive themselves warranted by the then existing circumstances. There have, until the present moment, been several new cases of fever, particularly a∣mong those citizens who returned earlier than the Com∣mittee thought prudent; many of whom have fallen vict∣ims <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the devouring pestilence. This, among other cir∣cumstances, has induced the Committee to withhold this invitation until the present time. The Committee beg leave further to inform their fellow-citizens, that from the numerous applications from the indigent for relief, they find it absolutely necessary to continue their labours some time longer.</P>
<P>The result of the whole number of deaths, during this awful calamity, was two thousand and eighty-six, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> eleven hundred and ten men, five hundred and eighty-nine women and eight hundred and eighty-five children. Of these, if we admit that one hundred died of the fever in August, its victims would amount to one thousand five hundred and twenty-four. A great many of our citizens too, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led, were likewise cut off by it, hence it is pro∣bable, that the sum of deaths would be between two thou∣sand four hundred, and two thousand five hundred: An awful number indeed! Particularly if we consider that more than one third, some suppose that one half of the inhabitants, had le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the city.</P>
<P>An opinion prevailed with many, that the progress of the disease varied according to the state of the atmosphere. To this I have paid some attention; but have not been able to ascertain that the opinion is correct. My readers, however, by comparing the table of Meteorological Ob∣servations with that which contains the daily returns of the dead, will be able to satisfy themselves in this particular. But, however doubtful I may be with respect to the above observations in general, I am certain, that cool mornings and evenings, accompanied by hot days, contributed great∣ly to spread the infection; that in case of a yellow fever, it is dangerous for those who have fled to return to their homes till frost has set in; and that a keen frost undoubt∣edly
<PB N="15" REF="035586_0014_1005F5F1979C0D58"/>
puts an almost instantaneous termination to the pro∣gress of the disorder.</P>
<P>Having thus given an account of the rise, progress, and decline of the late fever, I shall next lay before my readers, two communications with which I have been politely favoured, with respect to its origin &amp;c.</P>
<P>The first is from <HI>Doctor Samuel L. Mitchell, Professor of Natural History, Agriculture, and Chemistry in Colum∣bia College,</HI> a gentleman whose literary talents are not only celebrated in America, but likewise in every part of civil∣ized Europe. His opinion is contained in a letter ad∣dressed to me, in answer to one which I had written to him on the 23d of November last, and is as follows.—</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>NEW-YORK, <DATE>November 24, 1798.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your letter of yesterday, you request me to furnish you with such hints as may occur to me concerning the origin of the distemper, which, during the last three months, has afflicted the city of New-York. I with pleasure com∣municate to you on this point, such general ideas, as in∣stant recollection supplies me with. The great dispute which divides the citizens of the United States, whether this distemper is produced at home, or introduced from abroad, appears to me to be more of a speculative than of a practical nature. The experience of the inhabitants of ancient Rome, London, and indeed of most large and populous cities in Europe and Asia, have in the progress of their settlement, suffered excessively from mortal epe∣demics, Bassorah has more than once been nearly depo∣pulated, and other great cities of the eastern world, have from time to time, experienced a similar disaster. It is sufficiently evident to me that the production and con∣tinuance of these plagues are owing to an imperfect and wretched police; and I judge so because in all situations naturally healthy, where sickness of that kind has prevailed, it has been in all cases mitigated, and in many almost en∣tirely prevented, by the adoption of proper local regula∣tions. I think the experience of mankind is decisive on this point.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="035586_0015_1005F5F41F7BF790"/>
New-York, and some other cities and towns of North America, are beginning to suffer what other cities and town<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in ancient and modern times have undergone before them. In this country we have as yet lost only our thousands, but in Europe and Asia, they have lost their tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. A fate as severe as theirs awaits us, if we refuse to profit their experience. It is wiser and better to undertake reformation at once, than by waiting fifty, or an hundred, or five hundred years, with such decay of industry and destruction of life, as has been lately our lot, and after all be compelled to execute at last, that which is both our interest and our duty to perform without a moments delay.</P>
<P>I consider cleanliness in our persons, clothing and habita∣tions, to be a matter of moral obligation; and the punish∣ment which providence has wisely thought proper to in∣flict upon those who violate this law is sickness, not un∣frequently terminating in yellow-fever, pestilence and plague.</P>
<P>There is a vulgar saying which I have often heard <HI>"never mind it, one's one nastiness is sweet."</HI> It is certain that individuals endure patiently or even with∣out adverting to it, more of their <HI>own dirt</HI> than of <HI>other peoples'</HI> Mankind in almost all places appear to have acted for a long time under the influence of this pernici∣ous error; and accordingly when distempers have broken out in consequence of their own carelessness and indiscre∣tion, they have been fond of laying the blame on others. Hence it has been asserted with the utmost positiveness that the yellow-fever has been imported from the West-Indies, and plague from the Levant, while at the very time these assertions are so confidently made by some among us, the fact of local origin in those very places and countries is flatly denied by the people who dwell there. They like our own countrymen "think their own nastiness sweet," and cannot be persuaded it has any thing unhealthy or noxious in it.</P>
<P>But let us be candid and examine the subject fairly: If an army of ten thousand or any other number of men is encamped long in one spot of ground, it often happens that fevers and dysenteries break out among the soldiers; the number of men fit for parade hourly diminishes, and
<PB N="17" REF="035586_0016_1005F5F7FA6CE0F0"/>
the Hospitals are crouded with the sick. There can be no question that in such cases the causes of those distem∣pers are engendered there. Every prudent general knows the way to stop the ravages of the disease is to quit the in∣fected spot, and encamp upon a new and fresh piece of ground. And this ought always to be attended to in cam∣paigns, where the nature of the service will permit. In this case the men move away and leave the nuisances be∣hind.</P>
<P>What now is a modern city but a vast encampment? Are not the same causes of disease, daily and hourly accu∣mulating? Ought it to be a matter of surprize, that during a moist and hot season venom should be produced, rise into the air, and render it too foul and poisonous to sup∣port life? If it was possible to abandon the contaminated place, and change our ground, as a general changes his camp, the inhabitants of cities would escape diseases as well provided armies do. But seats of commerce, trade and manufacture, are destined to be the <HI>perpetual</HI> residence of persons engaged in certain kinds of business, who cannot, without irreparable loss and ruin, quit their improvements and occupations. There is a necessity, therefore, as they cannot move away from their nuisances, THAT THEIR NUISANCES SHOULD BE MOVED AWAY FROM THEM. Both common sense and common decency de∣mand the performance of this.</P>
<P>To be a little more particular: If my information is correct, the exhalations from privies and sinks in many parts of this city, have become not only intolerably of∣fensive, but actually pestilential, and the cause of disease. The vapours issuing from barrels of putrifying beef have poisoned a number of our citizens. Many stores, yards and cellars abound with substances equally detrimental to health; and in addition to this, it deserves to be men∣tioned that human carcases, buried and accumulated for a long series of years, have poisoned the air in many parts of christendom, and that by the concurrence of both mu∣nicipal and spiritual authority, the practice of interring in cities and church-yards, has been absolutely prohibited in many parts of Italy, on account of the horrid mischie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s occasioned thereby. Although the evil has not grown to such an alarming height among ourselves at this day,
<PB N="18" REF="035586_0017_1005F5F98DB4F110"/>
yet it is certainly worthy of consideration, whether it would not be better at once for christians to discard the super∣stition which leads to this practice, and imitate the Jews and Mahometans in conveying their carrion entirely out of town and burying it in places remote from the habita∣tions of the living. A regard for the preservation of po∣sterity, as well as our own present and personal security, imposes on us the adoption of some decisive measures upon this head.</P>
<P>So much for local origin in and about the habitations of men <HI>on shore.</HI> See next how the question stands with respect to <HI>importation.</HI> It is acknowledged, as has been observed, that cities, camps and houses, may become pe∣stilential and unsafe to dwell in, by reason of poisonous matter bred within them. Now, what is a ship but <HI>a house a-float?</HI> Every sea-vessel is, properly speaking, a <HI>human habitation.</HI> And in this house or habitation are frequently collected all the materials which are known to produce pestilence on the land. Human beings, too of∣ten neglectful of cleanliness during health, and in times of sickness frequently wallowing in their own filthiness, are the tenants of these floating houses; and they are some∣times surrouded by the sickening exhalations emitted from damaged provisions, hides, coffee, and whatever else composes their cargo, rendered active by moisture, quick∣ened by heat, and multiplied by being kept under hatches.</P>
<P>Of all the contrivances of art, a ship seems the most completely calculated to concentre &amp; work up to the highest degree of virulence, all manner of plague-producing things. The history of expeditions both for war and commerce, by sea, furnishes abundant evidence of this truth. Im∣portation then stands thus; the sickness of the crew may be caused by pestilential fluids, and these fluids are extri∣cated from foul and corrupt substances <HI>on board the vessel,</HI> and is as much local in its origin THERE as in any place that can be pointed out in this or any other city. Fur∣ther, I have it on the information of respectable masters of vessels, that in numberless instances the men fall sick ON BOARD, not only at sea, but in foreign ports and har∣bours without ever having been on shore, or having con∣nection with any person or thing that had come from the shore. And what adds to the conclusiveness of this state∣ment
<PB N="19" REF="035586_0018_1005F5FC2E6C9138"/>
is, that when the men get sick on board, the custom in a number of the West-India islands, is to send them on shore to recover their health.</P>
<P>If then, by IMPORTATION, is meant the <HI>taking on board the seeds of Yellow-Fever,</HI> and conveying them like grains of coffee or rice (for this is the language) from one region to another, the whole doctrine is indisputably fal∣lacious, being grounded on nothing better than a suppos∣ed analogy between things exceedingly different in nature from each other, and, on a misrepresentation of facts which has, alas! too generally and too long been countenanced by physicians and merchants of the highest character.</P>
<P>My other engagements prevent my adding any more. The contents of this letter are written with my own hand; and if there was any body now with me to whom I might dictate, I could easily add a few paragraphs on <HI>pre∣vention.</HI> This, however, must make a part of a public report on that subject, in which I am engaged, with seve∣ral gentlemen of learning, experience, and respectability. In the mean time, be assured, that no person wishes great∣er success to your labours, for the good of our fellow-citizens, than</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The second communication I received in a letter from Mr. Richardson Underhill, a respectable merchant of this city, on the 30th December, in answer to one which I had written to him, on the 23d of the same month. This Gentleman is indeed no regular bred physician; but as from motives of humanity, he had been very attentive to the distresses of the sick, during the calamity of the year 1795, and being a person of observation, he soon became acquainted with that mode of treatment; which was most conducive to their recovery. Upon the commencement of the fever of 1798, being again actuated by the most philanthropic principles, he embarked in the same hazard∣ous business, and was the happy means of mitigating the sorrows of many of the afflicted. To these he not only prescribed; but also assisted in administering such medi∣cines
<PB N="20" REF="035586_0019_1005F5FDCE9F7FF0"/>
as were deemed proper. He likewise took care, that all those whom he saw in want, should by some means or other be relieved. A conduct like his, is above eulo∣gium. The poor and needy, whose wants were supplied and whose diseases were cured by his means will no doubt think, as long as they live, of their benefactor with gra∣titude.</P>
<P>The communication with which Mr. Underhill, has fa∣voured me, appears to me, to be interesting and as I am convinced it will be considered in the same manner by most of my readers, I shall lay it before them without fur∣ther apology.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE> NEW-YORK, <DATE>12th Mo. 30th 1798.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>ESTEEMED FRIEND, JAMES HARDIE,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THY favor of the 23d. inst. I have the pleasure of ac∣knowledging. In this thou askest my opinion, respecting the origin of the disorder, to which so many of our citi∣zens have recently become victims; the method of cure pursued by me, and my opinion, what should be done by the proper authority, to prevent a return of this terrible pestilence.</P>
<P>In a mind, void of prejudice, it is more difficult, per∣haps, to form an exact opinion of the origin of this disor∣der, than most people, upon a transient view of the sub∣ject, would suppose; for my own part, neither my educa∣tion, nor my inclination, will permit me to form any theo∣ries, concerning the first engendering of pestilence, from combinations of gazes, or other causes. The dens, in which it is bred, and in which it lurks, until it issues forth to seize its prey, are more proper objects for persons in my sphere of life to enquire out and explore. To this purpose I have frequently revolved in my mind, whether it was an imported or homebred disorder, several circum∣stances concurring to produce an opinion of its being the latter. The rapid progress of it during one of the hotest summers we have ever experienced, just after a very heavy fall of rain, which stagnated in almost an innumerable number of cellars and back yards; the malignancy of it
<PB N="21" REF="035586_0020_1005F601ADDDA748"/>
in the neighbourhood of some of those cellars, many of them stowed with large quantities of putrid beef; in the neighbourhood of filthy sewers, or other nuisances, and, also, from its spreading on Golden-hill and Cliff-street, which are in a northerly direction from some of those dens of pestilence I have just mentioned, and of course liable to be acted upon by the prevailing south winds. But how∣ever well founded this opinion may be, with respect to the agency of those things, in producing the disease, yet with all these, other facts, which I will relate, has almost in∣duced me to believe, that all is not to be charged to them. They rendered the neighbourhood highly combustible, but perhaps a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spark of contagion might be necessary to pro∣duce so dreadful a conflagration. The first appearance of the disorder was in Front-street, near Coenties-slip, where Melancton Smith died, about the 28th, or 29th of July, and on the 30th Peter A. Schenk was taken severely sick. The following week, one Wilson, M. Smith. jun. Peter Dustan and wife, and A Adriance, had slight attacks, from whence it spread to other families in a very short time.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The people of this neighbourhood laid the blame of their sickness to the schooner Fox, which arrived from Jeremie between the middle and latter part of July, and hawled to a wharf a little cast of Coenties-slip, where she unloaded, and upon pumping her out, her bilge-water was very offensive; but I think the filth to be observed in this part of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own, quite as likely to give them fever as bilge-water and molasses.</NOTE></P>
<P>The next appearance of the fever was at the house of Henry Mead, at the lower corner on the west side of the New-slip. Some time in July, the ship Fame, said to have arrived from some one of the West-India islands, came to the wharf next below the New-slip, and lay there some time. About the 3d or 4th of August, some people went to discharging the ballast and pumping her out; a∣mong the ballast was a quantity of damaged coffee, ex∣tremely putrid, which, with the water discharged from the pump, was so offensive to the smell, that the neighbours were induced to shut their windows, especially while eat∣ing. About the 6th of said month, the following persons spent a considerable part of the day at Mead's house, John Taylor, Ebenezer Taylor, Sylvanus Seaman, Monmouth Hubbs, Walter Davis, Augustus Peck, and a young man, clerk in a store near the exchange: Most of these
<PB N="22" REF="035586_0021_1005F603F501DEB8"/>
dined there, and during their dinner, they were under the necessity of shutting up their doors and windows, though the weather was very warm, so exceedingly were they an∣noyed by the stench from the ship. Of this company, collected from several quarters, and who dispersed to their respective homes, not a single one escaped severe sick∣ness, which they were taken with in from 4 to 5 days, and of which John and Ebenezer Taylor died. Two persons belonging to the family were also sick. The next house above this, (there being none below it) was at the same time visited, and of 5 persons, three were taken danger∣ously ill and 2 died: In the second house above, 3 more persons were sick at the same time, and 1 died; and the family of the house next to this, shared a similar fate, 3 were sick, two of whom died in a very short time. Many of the boatmen, whose vessels lay in the slip at this period, fared no better, a number of them being victims to this stench, or the contagion it produced. On the east side of the slip, the inhabitants at this time were as healthy as usual for the season; but in the neighbourhood northerly, the disorder spread with great rapidity; scarcely a family escaped severe sickness for some distance in that direction: it is to be observed that the wind was wholly southerly.—Nathaniel Clark, who lives in Cherry-street, in this neigh∣bourhood, was on the wharf where this ship lay, and went home to his family, complained much of the stench he had smelt there, and in 3 or 4 days was taken with the fever, which he had severely: Several of his family sicken∣ed shortly after. From these facts it appears that the sick∣ness in this quarter was caused by the ship; whether it was created in her, or brought from another country, I cannot undertake to determine; but be it as it may, the fever was undoubtedly there contagious; and spread to distant parts of the town by means of the sick; the bodies of the inha∣bitants having (as I suppose) been rendered ripe for its re∣ception. From here I can trace it to the neighbourhood of Golden-hill, where a man named Harper, died in Gold-street on the 11th of August. One Fowler died the 18th of same month in John-street; and the 3d victim was So∣lomon Carl, who died on the 20th, in Gold-street. Har∣per imputed the origin of his sickness to his having crossed the deck of the ship beforementioned three days before he
<PB N="23" REF="035586_0022_1005EBE1A981DEA8"/>
was taken; a respectable merchant was with him, who has since told me they were offended with a very disagreeable smell. Solomon Carl was at the funeral of a woman na∣med Jones, who had died in the neighbourhood of the New-Slip, about 3 days before he sickened himself.</P>
<P>The methods I pursued to cure the disorder were gene∣rally very simple, such as were dictated by nature, and a small share of experience I had in the year 1795. I en∣deavoured always to purge the patient, bring on a gentle perspiration and continue it, which treatment of itself I may say cured hundreds; the medicines I selected to bring about those ends, were such as I deemed mildest and most efficacious in their operation: for the first purpose I used castor oil, and for the other, warm teas of cat-nip or balm; In obstinate cases, or cases attended with delirium, I used hot applications of ashes, bricks, &amp;c. wet with vi∣negar and spirits, and if I could raise a perspiration a cure generally ensued, particularly among middle aged persons of good constitutions. Those were the methods most used, tho' I found it necessary to var<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and use other means at times, according to the constitution of the patient, or stage of the disease, when I first began my prescriptions.</P>
<P>My opinion concerning what is necessary to prevent a return of this disorder is formed from the facts I have before related. I think it necessary to absolutely prohibit stagn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> waters and to compel those persons who have wet cellars, to keep them constantly pumped out and cleaned; to fill up the docks and slips, if not entirely, at least such parts of them as are too far from running water, or are exposed to the sun at low-water; to prevent provisions from being stored at all in town, during certain seasons of the year. Altho' this may be thought a great inconvenience, yet l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t it be remembered that the health of the whole ought not to be risqued for the convenience of many, much less <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a few; at all events provisions ought to be kept out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> damp cellars in hot weather, for when they are not abso∣lutely spoiled, their pickle sometimes smells very offen∣sive, and I judge all air to be noxious that offends my n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, at least, I know of no rule of judging which admits of fewer exceptions; to fill up the common sewers where practicable and let the filth which they are intended to hide appear to the eye in all its deformity, which will
<PB N="24" REF="035586_0023_1005F60787879108"/>
insure a more speedy removal; where they cannot be fil∣led <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p with propriety from the particular situation of the ground (if any such situation exist) let lime be frequently put in them; to prevent vessels which may arrive from warm climates during certain months in the year from coming to the city at all, until they have landed their car∣goes at some convenie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t place, remote from the centre of population,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I think at or near the Watering place, on Staten-Island, would be a proper situation for this purpose.</NOTE> where ware-houses might be prepared for the reception of their goods and from whence they might be transported at little expence to their respective con∣signees, after having been duly examined by a proper officer appointed for that purpose, whose duty it should also be to see that the ships were cleaned by admitting clean water in them and pumping it out, and afterwards pro∣perly fumigating them, after which they might freely be ad∣mitted to load at the usual wharves. I also think (from conversations I have had with several judicious persons upon the subject) that it would be proper to introduce the use of coal altogether as fuel in the low parts of the city, where the ground has been made wholly, or in part by co∣vering marshes and sloughs, with a few feet of harder earth: The method to be fallen upon to cause coal to be generally used in those situations, would perhaps require much consideration, by tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ whose province it is to consider on it; but I am inclined to believe, if it should be found up∣on due enquiry to be necessary, the general good sense of the people would lead them to adopt it without compulsi∣on. If to all these regulations, it were possible to add the salubrious influence of a stream of fresh water, cleansing the surface of our streets, I think this city may yet be bles∣sed with a good general state of health. I have been thus particular because thou requested it: If, from what I have written, thou canst glean any thing of service to thyself or the public, it will give sincere pleasure to thy real friend.</P>

The prevalence of the fever in New-York, is accounted for as follows, in the Philadelphia Gazette of the 4th inst. under the New-York head:</P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>"FEVER.</HEAD>
<P>A very considerable alarm having taken place among the citizens, and the most exaggerated reports circulated about the country, of the sickness with which certain parts of the city are afflicted, we have thought it a duty to make such enquiries as might enable us to place the matter in a point of view, as near the truth as possible.</P>
<P>"About the beginning of August, in consequence of the foul, unfinished state of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>everal water-lots, on the East river, between Coenties and the Old-slip, upwards of 20 persons were attacked nearly about the same time, with what appeared to be <HI>common colds,</HI> some slightly, others more severely; but the general occurrence of the fact in that neighdourhood, led to a belief that it arose from a <HI>local</HI> cause, and threatened something more serious. The foul∣ness of the lots, and especially two vacant ones, being re∣ceptacles of every kind of filth, was considered as <HI>that cause;</HI> and in pursuance of official arrangements, they were im∣mediately covered with wholesome sand: The effect was, a general restora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on of the sick.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of the New-slip, where the build∣ings for the most part are small, and many of them inhabi∣ted by poor people, who live in a crouded manner, and in situations incapable of proper ventilation, diseases oc∣curred about the 12th—a number of persons died—but at present there appears to be no great cause of alarm in that quarter.</P>
<P>"About the same period, or a little later, two or three persons were seized at Bruce's wharf, with suspicious symptoms, and some deaths have taken place there and in its vicinity, owing, it is generally thought, to the ex∣tremely foul condition of Bruce and Marston's unfilled lots, bounding on the East-river, at the foot of Pine-street the effluvia issuing from them being highly putrid and of∣fensive. Measures have been taken, and are now in ope∣ration, to cover them with wholesome earth, by which means it is hoped the evil in that quarter, if it has arisen from this source, may be corrected.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="035586_0025_1005F60D0649F858"/>
"About the 20th, several persons were seized in Cliff-street, nearly in the same manner as those between Coen∣ties-slip and the Old-slip. At first they generally consider∣ed their complaints to be mere colds taken by sleeping with open windows in the violent hot weather which then prevailed—Unfortunately, it was a more serious case. The patients rapidly grew worse, and several died as well there as in John, Gold and Rider-streets, and Eden's-Al∣lies, all lying within the vicinity of Burling-slip sewer. These complaints, on investigation, were thought to pro∣ceed, in part, from the offensive state of that sewer; which had, for some time, become a receptacle for vari∣ous species of putrid matter, and of which the mouth lies nearly opposite John-street, commonly called Golden-hill street—so that whenever a South or S. E. wind prevailed, it blew through the sewer, and bore a column of effluvia up John-street, and through that into Cliff and the adja∣cent streets, rendering the atmosphere intolerably bad. The best informed physicians are of this opinion. The head of the sewer has since been closed by a valve-door, and a considerable quantity of quick-lime thrown into it, with a view of neutralizing its contents. A similar door, with the same intention, has been added to the Ferry-street sewer.</P>
<P>"Other causes are also alledged, and with great plau∣sibility, at least, if not certainty.</P>
<P>"It is well known that the cessation of our commer∣cial intercourse with the French islands, in consequence of their hostile violence, has greatly lessened the demand for provisions; of course large quantities of bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> remain∣ed in many cellars, particularly among the merchants of Pearl-street. Much of this, from what is now seen to be an improper mode of packing, as directed by a late law, has lately become tainted, emitted a very putrid effluvi∣um—corrupting the air and contributing its share as a cause of disease. We learn that the commissioners of the health-office have taken measures to have it all inspected, and the spoiled removed out of town. Much already has been sent away, and the remainder is going as fast as pos∣sible.</P>
<P>"These causes, with the immense fall of rain, and vi∣olent heats, experienced in the course of August, are sup∣posed
<PB N="27" REF="035586_0026_1005F60E94865948"/>
to have originated the disease which has spread such panic as to drive many families into the country.</P>
<P>"On the most diligent enquiry, however, we cannot find out, that any great subject of alarm exists, except in the neighbourhood of the New-slip—in the vicinity of Burling-slip-sewer—and at the foot of Pine-street, at which places several persons have died.</P>
<P>"Individual cases have also occurred in other parts of the town, but, as in 1795, they remain insulated, and without communication to the attendants, as far as we can discover. These, it is generally thought, were taken at one or the other places before mentioned.</P>
<P>"An opinion has been avowed by some, that the dis∣ease has been imported, or arose from damaged coffee, thrown out of a ship on Kelly's dock, west of the New-slip. This, in the present instance, is utterly groundless, and can serve no purpose but that of delusion. The quan∣tity of refuse coffee, alluded to by our advocates for im∣ported contagion, did not exceed half a peck, and was the mere sweepings of the hold.</P>
<P>"We are informed by a gentleman who has been at the pains to collect a list of the persons interred in the several burial grounds, that during the last week they averaged about 12 per day—and that previous to Sunday last, there was no very unusual mortality for the season.</P>
<P>"With respect to new cases, enquiry at the best sour∣ces, enables us to say they have very much declined with∣in the last 24 hours, and that the disease yields more readi∣ly to medicine.</P>
<P>"How far this statement authorizes the extreme a∣larm which precipitates so many citizens out of town, we do not know; but it would at least be adviseable that all who remove should leave their houses, cellars and yards in a cleanly condition—that such as remain may not be ex∣posed to the bad effects of their carelessness and indiscre∣tion.</P>
<P>"The system of cleanliness adopted by the commissi∣oners of the health office, we are happy to observe, is pur∣sued with encreased vigour; and indefatigable efforts are daily made by that board, to preclude every source of im∣pure air in the city.</P>
<P>"This statement may be depended on—it is the result of enquiry of the first authority."</P>

To these opinions I shall add another, which my readers, will no doubt, consider as being very respectable; I mean that of our Health-Officer, Doctor Bayley. I have extracted what follows from a late very interest∣ing publication of his, entitled, <HI>"Letters from the Health Office to the Common Council."</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To the Common Council of the City of New-York.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>HEALTH-OFFICE, <DATE>December 4, 1798.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN addition to the facts which are contained in the cor∣respondence between the Health Commissioners and the Common Council for the year 1798, I shall offer to your consideration a few remarks upon the origin and progress of the pestilential disease which has lately prevailed in this city; and in order to corroborate what I may advance, I shall, in the first place take a retrospect of events which have annually taken place in this city, during the warm months since the year 1795.</P>
<P>According to the records of the Health-Office, the yel∣low fever appeared in 1796 at White-hall, at the foot of Pine-street, at Burling-slip, and in the neighbourhood of Roosevelt-street sewer.</P>
<P>In 1797 between Coenties and the Old-slip, in Front-street, at the Fly-market in several instances, in Fletcher-street, at Burling-slip, in Water-street, adjoining Roose∣velt-street sewer, in George-street, and at the foot of Pine-street.</P>
<P>In 1798 the disease first appeared about midway be∣tween Coenties and the Old-slip, in Front-street, be∣tween the 1st and 7th of August. On the 7th of August about twenty-three were reported sick to the Health-Of∣fice. From that period several others sickened, and of the whole number one died. By the 26th of August, the com∣plaint had disappeared in that quarter in consequence of the measures taken to remove the cause, by covering the offensive lots with clean, wholesome earth.</P>
<P>On the 12th of August, it appeared at No. 283, Water-street, in the case of Mr. Taylor, in an old broken build∣ing,
<PB N="29" REF="035586_0028_1005F61382A2D1E8"/>
on an unfinished lot at the foot of Dover-street, in which 11 persons died early in 1795, and which has since been repeatedly represented as a nuisance.</P>
<P>August 12, also, the disease appeared in the case of John Henderson, corner of James-street, and Batavia-lane. On all sides of his residence, which was a small crowded build∣ing, there were sunken lots in an unfinished state.</P>
<P>Again, on August 12, the disease appeared in William Whitlock, Card-maker, No. 51, Cherry-street. In the rear and to the south of his residence, the lots are very ge∣nerally below the level of the streets, and without drains.</P>
<P>August 13. Murdock M'Lean, Bruce's wharf, was seized, where the disease has regularly made its appear∣ance every warm season since the year 1795.</P>

On the morning of the 14th, the heaviest rain fell of any time during the year. It began at 5 A. M. and continued without intermission till nine. Numerous cellars, parti∣cularly those in the low parts of the city, were filled with water. Lispenard's meadow, which may be considered as within the limits of the city was entirely overflowed. In six days it had not subsided above ten inches; and the wa∣ter did not pass off, till a large drain was opened for that purpose, by order of the Common Council.</P>

<P>The sudden and great increase of heat immediately after the violent rain, appeared to have a proportionately in∣fluence in producing fever. Between that period and the 22d August, upwards of twenty persons in Cliff-street, were seized with slight indispositions, which they attributed to sleeping with open windows during the preceding hot and moist weather, but which appeared rather as the fore∣runner of yellow fever, for, not only the persons thus in∣disposed, but a number of others in the same street, had that disease in the course of a few days.</P>
<P>From this period the disease became more general; but its fatality was principally felt in Cliff-street and its neigh∣bourhood, at Catherine slip, in Water-street and on the unfinished grounds in the southern part of the city.</P>
<P>Now having seen that the yellow fever had made its ap∣pearance in New-York every year, for several years past, but has prevailed in very different degrees, it becomes a matter of great importance to determine, why the disease was so generally prevalent on the low new-made grounds in 1795, whilst it was scarcely felt in the more elevated situations; why, in 1796, and 1797, its appearance was limited to particular spots; and why, in 1798 it not only prevailed
<PB N="31" REF="035586_0030_1005F618D7C62E80"/>
on all the new-made grounds, but also in parts of the city which had before been exempted from the disease.</P>
<P>To answer these questions in such a manner, as to prove satisfactory to every one, might be a very difficult task. I shall, however, offer some reasons which may tend to shew why the fever was more prevalent this year, than in the preceding years.</P>
<P>It is well ascertained that in the year 1795, there was an unusual degree of heat and moisture in the atmosphere during the warmer months—that the Thermometer was considerably higher than in 1796 and 1797, but that in 1798, the heat greatly exceeded that of 1795.</P>
<P>Now, as heat and moisture are powerful agents in pro∣ducing pestilential diseases, so must the same causes neces∣sarily promote the extension of those diseases.</P>
<P>In the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>98, there were besides, local causes of fever in this city, which did not exist in the other seasons, and which, co-operating with the weather, served to extend the disease beyond the limits, to which it would probably have been otherwise confined. I have reference to the immense quantities of spoiled beef, fish, and other articles of a perishable nature, which were stored in different parts of this city. The noxious exhalations arising from these sources, in my apprehension, was a great cause why the disease arose and raged with great violence in particular situations: And when we consider the sudden appearance of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever at Golden-hill and in Cliff-street, and the great number which sickened nearly at the same time, there is great reason to believe this opinion well founded.</P>
<P>About the 20th of August, a report was made to the Health Office, that great quantities of spoiled beef were stored in Pearl-street, between Burling and Beekman-slips. The stench which issued from some of the cellars in this situation, was so considerable, as to prove very offensive to those who passed by, and became a subject of general ob∣servation. Letters, in consequence, from the Health-Office, were addressed to owners of provisions in that quarter, en∣joining them to have the beef examined, and to have such as was spoiled, sent out of the city. Instead, however, of adopting this plan, the beef was brought from the cellars into the street, the barrels opened, and the putrid pickle
<PB N="32" REF="035586_0031_1005F61B387F8FE0"/>
thrown into the gutters. In some instances the examina∣tion was made in the cellars, and the pickle disposed of in the same manner. The gutters which conveyed away this putrid pickle, led to Burling-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lip sewer.</P>
<P>The relative situation of this sewer, and Cliff-street is such that the southerly and south-easterly winds, force a current of air through the sewer, carrying with it the exhala∣tions arising from the noxious matter collected together in that place, and having a direction to pass more immediate∣ly up Golden-hill, and into Cliff-street; and every person in that neighbourhood with whom I have conversed, agrees as to the offensive smell of the air, previous to the appear∣ance of the fever.</P>
<P>On the 20th of August, the wind, which had been blow∣ing from the north and west some days previous, shifted to the south-east, and continued to blow from that quarter some time. In 48 hours after this, there was scarcely a house in Pearl-street, near where the spoiled provisions were stored, in the lower end of John-street, and in Cliff-street, which did not contain sick.</P>
<P>The sudden appearance of fever in this part of the city, and the great number which were in so short a time affec∣ted, proves the local nature of the cause; and to the one which I have just mentioned, I have no hesitation, in ascribing all the effects which were experienced.</P>
<P>If what we have alledged, be admitted sufficient to ex∣plain the appearance of fever which took place in Cliff-street, &amp;c. we have made some advances towards account∣ing for the general prevalence of the disease in 1798.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de the H. Office correspondenc on the subject of spoiled provisions.</NOTE></P>
<P>But, gentlemen, we have further to remark a particu∣lar difference in the warm seasons of 1798 and 1795.</P>
<P>In 1795 the weather was warm and moist, but there was but very little rain.</P>
<P>In 1798 the weather was not only much warmer, but was accompanied by sudden and heavy rains.</P>
<P>Immediately after the rains the public papers teemed with addresses to the citizens, entreating them to empty their cellars of the water which had collected in them, or the most fatal effects would be felt from neglect, or inat∣tention to this circumstance. It is not my intention to dispute the opinion advanced by these writers. But, if
<PB N="33" REF="035586_0032_1005F61D8DF4D870"/>
the production of disease, was to be apprehended from the lodgment of water in places where the sun's rays never en∣ter, what effects were to be expected from the ponding of water in those numerous lots and yards within this city, which are several feet below the level of the streets, con∣taining dead animal and vegetable matters, and to which the rays of the sun have full access? I wish you, gentle∣men, to reflect seriously upon this comparison, and be∣lieve, that whilst those sunken, undrained lots are suffer∣ed to remain in their present state, unless causes cease to produce their effects, diseases must inevitably result.</P>
<P>On examining the records of the legislature of this state, it will be found, that petitions have been preferred to that body, for permission to erect mill-dams on certain streams of water in some of the northern counties, and the prayer of the petitioners has been granted. The consequence was, that considerable tracts of low grounds in the neigh-hood of the mill-dams, were overflowed in the spring, and after the water had passed off, and the surface of those grounds were exposed to the influence of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un, exhala∣tions of so baneful a nature arose, as to produce a fever of a bilious type, which attacked almost every body with∣in a certain distance from their source, and proved very mortal in its effects. The cause of this sickness being so obvious, petitions were presented to the legislature, pray∣ing for a redress of the grievances. To correct the evil, it of course was necessary to destroy the mill-dams, and as soon as the waters were unobstructed, and allowed to flow in their usual channel, the country became as healthy as before.</P>
<P>Permit me, gentlemen, to ask the following questions: If the result of exhalations arising from grounds which have been covered with water in an open country, has been the production of bilious remitting fevers, attended with considerable mortality, what result ought we to ex∣pect from those exhalations which arise from the ponding of water on 150 acres of low grounds and sunken yards and lots in a crouded city, and of a southern aspect?</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I shall take the liberty of noticing some of the public measures that have been adopted for the removal of causes of disease in this city. I shall con∣fine myself to two principal objects:</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="035586_0033_1005F61FD6291C68"/>
<HI>First.</HI> The want of a sufficient descent on the low grounds along the east-river, to carry off the waters from the streets, is generally admitted. A considerable quan∣tity of water must necessarily stagnate in the gutters of these streets, and also in the sunken pavement. In dry weather this lodgement consists principally of water which has been used for culinary and other family purposes, and must therefore, be supposed to abound with matters to afford noxious exhalations.</P>
<P>By an ordinance of the Corporation for cleaning the streets, the inhabitants are directed to scrape out the dirt and filth collected in the gutters, and heap them up in the streets, to be removed by the scavengers <HI>in the course of the day.</HI></P>
<P>Now, does this regulation in any degree subserve the purposes for which it was ordained? Does not the spread∣ing of this dirt and filth, and exposing new and greater surfaces, increase the mischief which the measure was in∣tended to correct? I believe, gentlemen, there will be found no other means to rid the low grounds of this city, from the baneful effects of stagnant waters, and an accu∣mulation of noxious matters, than their being freely wash∣ed by currents of water flowing over them.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> In the same ordinance, the citizens are pro∣hibited from throwing into the streets, from their respect∣ive houses, cellars, or yards, any dirt, filth, or o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>als whatever, except on certain days. How will this be found to operate in <HI>removing</HI> the causes of disease? Should we not rather ask, how this will be found to operate in <HI>in∣creasing</HI> the causes of disease? One moment's reflection, I presume, will convince us that some means ought to be adopted to remedy a system so fraught with mischief, and for these means I take the liberty of referring you to letter 70, addressed by the Commissioners of the Health Office to the Common Council.</P>

From the preceding statements, it will appear to my readers, that the cause of the origin of this disorder, is still a matter of question amongst the learned; and that it is not as yet fully decided, whether the calamity, with which the cities of the United States have within these few years been repeatedly afflicted, has been imported, or that it is engendered in our own country. Several reasons, how∣ever, induce me to incline to the latter opinion.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> We are situated in the same latitude with those places of the old world, where pestilential disorders annu∣ally predominate. With those places we are alike expos∣ed during the summer months to the united effects of heat and moisture, and from similar causes similar effects may be always expected.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The fever with which we were lately afflict∣ed, although its first appearance was at one particular spot, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ties-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lip, yet it was soon afterwards seen in so many different parts of the city, and so far remote from one another, that it is by no means probable that the con∣tagion could be communicated so speedily. Indeed, if the contagion was imported it would seem to me, that there must have been at least seven or eight different sour∣ces of infection, or it could not have appeared in every di∣rection from the ship-yards to the battery, almost about the same time.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> As a proof that this fever may be engendered in our climate, it may be added that it had at different times made its appearance in the vicinity of low marshy grounds both in this and the neighbouring states <HI>(See Webster's Collection of Papers on the subject of Bilious Fevers preva∣lent in the United States for a few years past)</HI> and that it appeared in the state of New-Jersey during the last autumn, is pretty evident from the two following extracts of letters from two eminent physicians in that state.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract of a letter from Dr. Jonathan Elmer, of Bridge-town, New-Jersey, to a Physician in Philadelphia, dated December 6.</HEAD>
<P>"From many facts I am induced to believe (tho' very reluctantly) that there were cases of the yellow-fever in this place during the last autumn, which originated on the spot, and that its propagation was occasioned, or at least
<PB N="36" REF="035586_0035_1005F6241BF74D40"/>
promoted, by local infection, or generated in the place of its origination."</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>Extract of a letter from Dr. Lummis, of Woodbury, dated Dec. 4 to a Physician in Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<P>"During the late autumn, in the months of September and October, I visited several persons affected with the bilious yellow-fever, who had no possible opportunity of deriving their disease from any foreign source. Knowing that this disease might have been of domestic origin, and probably introduced among them from the city of Phila∣delphia, I was exceedingly particular in my enquiries on this point, and being satisfied from the testimony of the persons attacked, and of the families in which they resided, of their not having any communication with the city of Philadelphia for a long time previous to their suffering with the disease; and of their having avoided, in the most careful manner, all intercourse with families affected with the yellow-fever in their own neighbourhood, I have no hesitation in believing their disease to have been the offs∣pring of local causes. The Majority of these cases have occurred in families living on farms situated on the Jersey shore of the Delaware. The most valuable part of these farms consist of meadow; the proximity of these situations to the Delaware, and large tracts of meadow land lead me to ascribe their disease (aided by a peculiar state of the air) to the exhalations or marsh effluvia, arising from the low grounds situated near the banks, and the meadows in the vicinity of the Delaware. The peculiar disposition of these exhalations to produce disease and death, was evinced early in the season by the mortality which pre∣vailed among the fowls and cats in this neighbourhood. I am not alone in having seen cases of yellow-fever which cannot be traced to contagion. Similar facts have been witnessed this season by other Physicians, in various parts of New-Jersey."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>I have already observed that our climate being the same with those places in the old world, which are annually ex∣posed to pestilential disorders, we cannot expect to be en∣tirely exempt from them. But at the same time I am fully persuaded, that if we make use of those means, which Divine Providence has put in our power, we have little to apprehend, on the score of their return or spread∣ing
<PB N="37" REF="035586_0036_1005F625D9EB8F20"/>
in this country. In Turkey where pestilential disor∣ders are exceedingly prevalent, such is the indolence of the inhabitants that little or no attempts are made to pre∣vent their return or to stop their ravages: for to use the words of Mr. John Payne, in his excellent system of Ge∣ography, now publishing in this city, by John Low, Bookseller, at the Shakespeare's Head, No. 332 Water street, "The doctrine of predestination and still more the barbarism of the government have hitherto prevented the Turks from attempting to guard against this destructive disorder, (meaning the plague) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the success however, of the precautions taken by the Franks, has of late began to make some impressions upon many of them. The Christians of the country, who trade with European na∣tions, would be disposed to shut themselves up like them; but this they cannot do without the authority of the Porte. It seems indeed, as if the Divan would at last pay some attention to this object, if it be true that an edict was issued in 1783, for the establishment of a Lazaretto as Constantinople and three others at Smyrna, Candia, and Alexandria. The government of Tunis adopted this wise measure some years ago; but the Turkish police is every where so wretched, that little success can be hoped from these establishments notwithstanding their extreme impor∣tance and the safety of the Mediterranean states."</P>
<P>The above is the state of pestilential disorders amongst them; but surely with us it is widely different. Many of our citizens, indeed, believe in the doctrine of predesti∣nation as well as the Turks; but at the same time, almost every individual in case of any calamity, thinks it his du∣ty to make use of those means which Providence has put in his power, to avert it. Our police is likewise, by no means, wretched. Our magistrates, to whom the health of our citizens is confided, are men of intelligence, and when the sources from which pestilence arise in our cities is better understood, which from the measures lately taken, we may soon expect, there is little doubt, that our cities shall in a short time be either wholly exempt from, or at least partially visited by the direful calamity of the yellow-fever.</P>
<P>To prevent its return has not only been an object of desirous enquiry with the magistrates of different cities,
<PB N="38" REF="035586_0037_1005F629D9AA2CD8"/>
but also with our national government; for the President of the United States, in his speech on the opening of the last session of Congress, thus addressed himself to the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nate and House of Representatives:—</P>
<P>"While with reverence and resignation we contem∣plate the dispensations of Divine Providence, in the a∣larming and destructive pestilence with which several of our cities and towns have been visited, there is cause for gratitude and mutual congratulations, that the malady has disappeared, and that we are again permitted to assemble in safety, at the seat of government, for the discharge of our important duties. But when we reflect, that this fatal disorder has, within a few years made repeated rava∣ges in some of our principal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ports, and with increased malignancy, and when we consider the magnitude of the evils arising from the interruption of public and private business, whereby the national interests are deeply affected; I think it my duty to invite the legislature of the union to examine the expediency of establishing suitable regulati∣ons in aid of the health laws of the respective states; for these being formed on the idea that contagious sickness may be communicated throughout the channels of com∣merce, there seems to be a necessity, that Congress who alone can regulate trade, should frame a system which, while it may tend to preserve the general health, may be compatible with the interests of commerce, and the safety of the revenue."</P>
<P>The Governor of Pennsylvania, likewise in his address to the legislature of that state, recommends to their seri∣ous consideration, such measures as he believed most likely to prevent a like visitation as that of the autumns of 1793, 1797, and 1798; and I am happy to add, that the business will no doubt be taken up by the general go∣vernment of the Union, as a committee was appointed to report on that part of the president's speech, which respected this truly important subject. To this I may add that the Common Council of New York, anxious to guard our city against the return of pestilence, addressed the Medical Society, soon after the decline of the disor∣der requesting them to give their opinions with respect to its origin, best method of prevention, &amp;c. and that in
<PB N="39" REF="035586_0038_1005F62C2AA557D8"/>
consequence the society appointed a committee of their own body, consisting of Doctors Samuel L. Mitchell, James Tillary, and John B. Rodgers, to consider the mat∣ter, and to report accordingly. The literary talents of these gentlemen are well known, and their seal and anxi∣ety to prevent the sufferings of the distressed, will never be called in question. We may, therefore, speedily ex∣pect, from their united efforts, a publication, which will be read by most of our citizens with the greatest avidity; and which I have no doubt will be productive of the high∣est utility.</P>
<P>The situation of our fellow citizens in Philadelphia, was not very different from those of New-York. What, there∣fore, might be useful to prevent the return of the fever in one place, may be of equal utility in another. I shall, therefore, lay before my readers the opinion of the aca∣demy of medicine of Philadelphia addressed to the go∣vernor.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>On the Origin and Means of preventing the return of the Yellow Fever.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN order to comply with your request to the academy of medicine, communicated by Dr. Samuel Duffield, the consulting physician of the port, respecting the means, of preventing the return of the epidemic fever which has lately afflicted our city, the academy have conceived the history of its origin necessarily connected with their answer.</P>
<P>We believe it was derived from the following sources:</P>
<P N="1">1. The exhalations of the alleys, gutters, docks, and common sewers of the city; and from stagnating water in its neighborhood.</P>
<P N="2">2. The foul air discharged with the ballast of the ship Deborah, and the cargo of the brig Mary: the former of which arrived from Hispaniola on the 18th of July, and the latter on the 29th of the same month. We reject the opinion of an imported human contagion in either of the above vessels. It has not been asserted that any person died of the yellow fever on board the Mary, during her voyage; and if it be said, that several persons died on
<PB N="40" REF="035586_0039_1005F62E9379D700"/>
board the Deborah of that disease, on her passage to this city, we cannot admit that they contaminated the timbers or contents of the ship in such a manner, as to spread the disease to persons at several hundred feet distance from the wharf at which she was moored. The improbability of this opinion will appear from two considerations.</P>
<P>First—The disease is not contagious in the West Indies; and rarely, if ever so, in the United States in hot weather, at which time only it makes its first appearance in our country. So general is this opinion, that some physicians have unfortunately refused to admit the existence of the fever in its commencement in our city, only because it was not contagious.</P>
<P>Second—The disease was in no instance propagated by those persons who were supposed to have derived it from human contagion, adhering to the timbers and contents of the Deborah and Mary, and who died with it in parts of the city remote from the influence of the foul air of those vessels.</P>
<P>It is said that the contagion of the yellow fever is not uniform in its effects, it ought, at least, to be admitted, that it acts with most certainty where it exists with most force; but a reverse of this took place in the supposed origin of our late fever, from imported contagion. We are the more determined in our opinion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul air of the Deborah and Mary being the cause of many cases of our fever, from similar cases of fever having been often produced from similar causes, instances of which were mentioned in our letter to you last year.</P>
<P>In support of our opinion of the disease being deprived from the exhalations of our city before enumerated, we shall mention the names of the following persons, who had the fever before the arrival of the Deborah or Mary in our port, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Benjamin Jones, from Berger's court, June 2d Mary Wrigglesworth, near the corner of Walnut and Tenth streets, June 6th; Rebecca Trested, in Front be∣tween Spruce and Union streets, June 11th; Eliza Curran, Fourth below South street, 27th June; Mark Miller, Callowhill street, and Molly Zeller, Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> street, July 2d; Miss Byrne, Spruce, between Second and Third streets, July 11th; Mr. Vannost, Shannon street wharves, July 12th. We observed, moreover, and heard of a considerable
<PB N="41" REF="035586_0040_1005F630DE7A8938"/>
number of persons who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the disease in the western parts of the city, and in Southwark and the Northern Li∣berties, who had not been exposed to contagion, nor breathed the air in the neighbourhood of Water-street for many weeks, and in some instances for several months be∣fore they were attacked by that fever.</P>
<P>In addition to the arguments in favour of the domestic sources of the fever that have been mentioned in our for∣mer letter, we shall add four more that we think cannot be refuted.</P>
<P N="1">1. The atmosphere of our city, during the prevalence of the fever, produced sensations of pain or sickness in ma∣ny people who came into it from the country; the same atmosphere became the cause of the disease and death in others who visited the city, and who carefully avoided lodging, or any intercourse with persons infected by the fever.</P>
<P N="2">2. The disease prevailed in many inland towns of the United States, which had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> intercourse with sea-port towns in which it was epidemic. Those towns were, in every instance we have heard of, situated near to putrid substances, or stagnating water.</P>
<P N="3">3. The disease was rarely contagious, even when it ter∣minated in death, when carried into the country, or into towns not exposed to putrid exhalations.</P>
<P N="4">4. The general extinction of the disease by frost▪ clear∣ly proves that it exists chiefly in the atmosphere; and that it is not derived, in the first instance, from human conta∣gion; for frost, it is well known, does not act in the au∣tumnal months upon the bodies of the sick, nor upon their beds, cloathing, or any other supposed receptacle of contagion.</P>
<P>We wish to direct the attention of our fellow citizens to the history of the causes and remedies of pestilential dis∣eases in foreign countries: In the ages of medical super∣stition, when those diseases were believed to be imported, they nearly depopulated cities for many successive years. Frequent and accumulated suffering at last begat wisdom. The causes of pestilence were discovered to exist in all countries, and domestic remedies were applied to remove them. The effect of this change in the opinion and con∣duct of the nations of Europe, has been the almost gene∣ral
<PB N="42" REF="035586_0041_1005F6331E838218"/>
extirpation of malignant fevers from their cities and sea-ports. We have many documents to prove that the recurrence of the yellow fever has been prevented in the cities of Europe by cleanliness. It formerly prevailed in Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Holland, and occasion∣ally, in Britain and Ireland, under the names of putrid, malignant, and bilious fevers, also of the <HI>gall-sickness</HI> and of the <HI>black-fever.</HI> The last name was derived from the black vomiting, which is so often the symptom of ap∣proaching death in billious fevers.</P>
<P>We are the more confirmed in the opinion we have de∣livered, that the yellow fever is a native disease of our country, by discovering that the same opinion is held by most of the physicians and citizens of our sister states. We lament the prevalence of an opinion, that the admission of truth upon this subject, will injure the credit of our ci∣ty. Truth, upon all subjects, is ultimately friendly to general interest and happiness, while the remedies of the evils of error, are always of a partial and transitory nature. We conceive that the report of the existence of a nature so subtile as to elude the utmost force of the health-laws, and the greatest vigilance of health-officers, will be much more injurious to our city, than a belief of its being deri∣ved from causes which are obvious to our senses, and which by active exertions might be <HI>easily</HI> and <HI>certainly</HI> re∣moved, without oppressing or injuring our commerce.</P>
<P>We shall repeat, in this place, the means recommended by us in our former letter, with the addition of some o∣thers for preventing a return of the disease.</P>

<HEAD>DESULTORY OBSERVATIONS and REFLECTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE following observation made by Mr. Charles Holt, in his account of the yellow fever as it appeared at New-London, in the fall of 1798, is equally applica∣ble to this and to every other city attacked with pestilence: "What striking instances of the transitoriness of life does such a disease afford! We see men exulting in the bloom of youth and prime of health and strength, in three or four short days numbered with the dead. Our gayest companions, our loveliest friends, in less than a week, are laid in the dust. When we are daily witnessing these scenes around us, who can avoid reflecting often, and feelingly, that, his <HI>turn may be next!</HI> yet the mind, when habitu∣ated to the most afflictive and extraordinary events, be∣comes hardened, and views them with unconcern and in∣difference. Disease, and death, the most dreadful acci∣dents that can afflict the human frame, when made fami∣liar to the sight, cease to inspire dread, and are ranked with the most common occurrences.</P>
<P>Upon the first appearance of the fever, many of our inhabitants had recourse to some sort of supposed preven∣tatives against infection. Thus, some chewed garlic, o∣thers smoaked tobacco, and others hoped to avoid the dis∣order by having recourse to smelling-bottles, handker∣chiefs
<PB N="45" REF="035586_0044_1005F63A9EBB1890"/>
dipped in vinegar, camphor bags, &amp;c. so that few individuals could be seen in the streets, without one or other of these applied to his nostrils. At last, however, experience had proved, that these were inefficaciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. A reliance on divine Providence succeeded, and in the most terrible stages of the disorder, the citizens discovered the most decent fortitude, and the greatest resignation. These imaginary preventatives were therefore thrown aside.</P>
<P>It has often been said, that temperance was the best preservative against infection. The observation, in gene∣ral, is certainly just; but it may, and, during the late calamity has, been carried too far. For my part, from what has come under my own knowledge, I have no hesitation in asserting, that to persons, who had been accustomed to live freely, nothing could be more danger∣ous, than to become remarkably abstemious upon the ap∣pearance of this disorder. Persons of the above description, should in my opinion, have continued to live in their usual manner; by which means, they would have been more likely to repel infection, or if infected, they would have more strength to resist the attack. But whilst I consider abstinence in such a situation, as being highly improper, a state of intemperance is certainly more so, for were it ne∣cessary, I could mention the names of several individuals, who, whilst in a state of intoxication, were attacked with the fever, and in two days after, were tenants of the grave. The fate of such people might be pronounced almost with certainty: they were seized with symptoms of a peculiar∣ly malignant nature, and their death seemed unavoidable.</P>
<P>Mr. Carey, in his account of the Yellow Fever in Phi∣ladelphia, in the year 1793, mentions some distressing scenes which took place, in that city, in consequence of some women in labour, being greatly at a loss for want of assistance. Difficulties of the same sort, occurred in New York, during the sickness of 1798, but by no means in the same degree. There were however several instances of distress, in this particular, of which I shall only
<PB N="46" REF="035586_0045_1005F63D3713E250"/>
select one. My wife was taken in labour on the 20th Sept. about 9 in the evening. I applied to many Doctors and Midwives. Some were really sick; some pretended to be so, and others candidly told me, that in consequence of the pestilence, which prevailed in my vicinity, they would on no account attend. At five in the ensuing morn∣ing, I applied to Mrs. Bunting, a midwife at Deans dock Greenwich Street, who immediately came with me. I would not have mentioned this circumstance; but that it afterwards came to my knowledge, that Mrs. Bunting, in cases where the disorder raged with the utmost malignity, never hesitated to attend any persons in that situation, and that too in many cases where she must have been con∣vinced, she would never receive any emolument. Such instances of disinterested philanthropy, ought not, in a pub∣lication of this sort to be omitted. They do honour to human nature.</P>
<P>No disease has, perhaps, on any previous occasion been more fatal to physicians, than that with which we were lately afflicted: for during its prevalence, exclusive of medical students, no less than sixteen physicians have been swept off, in discharging the perilous duties of their profession. These are Doctors Andrews, Brooks, D. Chickering, Dingley, Peter Faugeres, John B. Hicks, John B. Jones, Melchen Caldwell, Lamb, Millegan, J. B. Scandella, Elihu H. Smith, Teller, Tredwell, Va∣rick, and Young. As all these gentlemen fell sacrifices to their endeavours to relieve the distressed, it might appear invidious, were I to point out those, who in my opinion were most useful and eminent in their profession. I shall therefore only mention the case of J. B. Scandella, who, being a foreigner of distinguished literary abilities, and possessed of the most philanthropic principles, along with the others, fell a sacrifice to his humanity. This gentleman was a native of Venice, and descended of one of the most noble families in that country. He was, however, more distinguished by the spelndour of his ta∣lents, than by the nobility of his birth. A liberal curiosi∣ty had led him to this country, when he had just finished his researches, and was preparing to embark for Europe,
<PB N="47" REF="035586_0046_1005F63FF5B0DF80"/>
when motives of humanity led him back to Philadelphia, in the height of the late Epidemic. From thence he re∣turned in six days, having previously contracted that fatal disease, of which he expired, after a short, though very painful illness, in the bloom of his age, and the vigour of his faculties. The great attention which was paid to this unfortunate stranger, by Dr. Elihu H. Smith, was like∣wise in all probability, the immediate cause of his death.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that although, there were, during the time of this pestilence, about 800 people in the Alms House, no more than 24 died in all, and of these, only 7 of the disorder. It is likewise certain that these 7, caught the pistemper in the city, and that, in no instance, contagion was communicated from one to another in that building. This uncommon healthiness in a place, where there were so many people together, may, in all probabili∣ty be attributed to its airy situation, the spaciousness of the rooms, the remarkable cleanliness insisted upon by the manager Mr. Dodge, and the liberal use of lime.</P>
<P>It has been remarked, that during the several visitations of yellow fever, with which different cities of the United States have been afflicted, that more men than women have died of the disorder, in the proportion in general of about four to three; but during the pestilence of last au∣tumn, in this city, the proportion of the men who were cut off was still greater; there being very nearly about two men for one woman. This disproportion, however, of the fatality to the two sexes, need not appear strange, when we consider that men, by the nature of their employ∣ment, are more exposed to infection than women. The man having occasion to bustle about from one place to another, whilst the woman's particular province is the su∣perintendance of the family concerns.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="035586_0047_1005F641974B26680"/>
It has been formerly asserted by several physicians of eminence, that the blacks were much less subject to the ravages of the Yellow Fever, than the whites. This opin∣ion was no doubt productive of considerable utility to the citizens of Philadelphia, during their affliction of the year 1793, as the people of colour were almost exclusively the only persons, who would venture to nurse the sick. The idea, however, that they ran no risque of receiving infec∣tion appeared fallacious, as many of them died in that city▪ during the time of that sickness. I may add, that during our late calamity, I have every reason to believe that the fatality was fully as great amongst the blacks, as the whites in proportion to their numbers. This, however, may not appear to a number of my readers, when they find in my list containing the number of persons interred in each of the burying grounds of this city, that I have only men∣tioned 41 negroes. It ought therefore to be observed, that exclusive of these 41 who were buried in what is call∣ed the <HI>Negroes Burying Ground,</HI> there were no doubt, six times that number buried in the Potter's field, at Belle∣vue, and in some of the grave yards of this city.</P>
<P>Some extracts of letters from Philadelphia, published in our newspapers in this city, announce, that there are still several cases of yellow fever amongst them. There are also reports to the same purpose with respect to its ex∣istence amongst us, Jan. 16th; but upon the most particular enquiry of a number of respectable Physicians, and others, I cannot find a single instance of its having been seen here for these several weeks past: And I am almost convinced, that the situation of the Philadelphians is as healthy at present as ours.</P>
<P>Many publications have been issued on the subject of the Yellow Fever, by gentlemen of literary talents. I have it from good authority, that another will soon make its ap∣pearance, written by Doctor Hitchcock.</P>

<HEAD>The POOR, AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY WERE RELIEVED, In the City, at Bellevue, and in the Debtors Appartment.</HEAD>
<P>IN a calamity so terrible and unexpected, the distress of of the labouring poor were unavoidably great. The general stagnation of business had deprived them of their ordinary means of support and rendered them unable to remove where employment and subsistence might be had. To add to their difficulties, their employers, and more affluent acquaintances, who might have been disposed to relieve their wants, had in general fled.</P>
<P>But these were not the only objects of commiseration. Many, who had supported themselves and families in an easy, though not affluent manner, were from the impossi∣bility of earning any thing, the difficulty of recovering their little debts and the heavy expences incident to a state of sickness, reduced to the most extreme distress, whilst others, in opulent circumstances, having remained in the city, after their connexio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s had removed, being suddenly seized with the prevailing disorder, were le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t helpless by themselves, without a friend to console them, a physician to prescribe for them or a nurse to administer the pre∣scription.</P>
<P>The Health Commissioners, appointed by authority of the State Legislature, had hitherto exerted their utmost endeavours to alleviate the various afflictions of the dis∣tressed, but the Common Council being informed that the number of sick had become so great and were still encreas∣ing, that the Commissioners could not take care of them all, that the accommodations at <HI>Bellevue</HI> were insufficient and that many of the poor sick were so circumstanced as to render a removal there both inconvenient and impro∣per, on the 10th September appointed <HI>Gabriel Furman; John B. Coles, Theophilus Beekman, Jacob de la Montag∣nie</HI> and <HI>Richard Furman, Esqrs.</HI> five of the Alder∣men, together with <HI>John Bogert</HI> and <HI>Philip I. Arcularius Esqrs.</HI> two Assistant Aldermen, a committee of their own board denominated <HI>the Health Committee of the City of
<PB N="50" REF="035586_0049_1005F647B66794F0"/>
New-York,</HI> "with full powers to make such other build∣ings for the sick at <HI>Bellevue,</HI> as they, with the advice of the Commissioners of the Health-Office might think ne∣cessary; and to take into their charge and furnish with medical aid, and every necessary, all such of the sick poor as could not be accommodated at <HI>Bellevue,</HI> or the situation of whose persons or families were such as to ren∣der their removal to <HI>Bellevue</HI> improper or inconvenient."</P>
<P>The gentlemen so appointed, totally disregarding their <HI>own</HI> preservation, and only intent on arresting the progress of the disorder and relieving the distressed, with a magna∣nimity and patriotism meriting the highest eulogiums, rea∣dily stept forth and by their generous, stedfast and bene∣volent exertions, undoubtedly saved many of their fel∣low citizens from penury, disease and death. As soon as they accepted the appointment to this arduous under∣taking, they immediately proceeded to business and ap∣pointed Alderman Gabriel Furman their chairman, a gentleman, who together with Alderman Beekman had been on the committee for the relief of the sick and indi∣gent in the years 1793 and 1794, and also during the pes∣tilential disorder of 1795. I have already observed, that one of the objects for which the committee was appoint∣ed was to make such further buildings and accommodati∣ons for the sick at Bellevue as they with the advice of the Commissioners of the Health-Office might think necessary. They accordingly gave orders for the erection of two buildings, one of which should be sixty feet in length by twenty in breadth, for the accommodation of the sick, and another of the same extent, but two stories in height, for the reception of the convalescents; and such was the dis∣patch of the workmen employed in that business, that both were compleated in about eight days.</P>
<P>Previous to this the sick, the convalescent and the dying were all crowded together, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e apartments were by no means sufficient for the number of the diseased; but by this humane attention, the convalescents were separat∣ed from the sick, and from that time the number of those who recovered at that hospital was much greater in pro∣portion than it had been before. There was likewise other circumstances which no doubt greatly contributed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> happy change. The attendants and nurses, at first ap∣pointed
<PB N="51" REF="035586_0050_1005F64A4F28B4F0"/>
for the care of the sick, were in general persons of rather indifferent character, and of course that attenti∣on was not paid to the sick which the Commissioners could have wished. The truth is that at the commence∣ment of this melancholy business, fear pervaded the stout∣est heart and terror was depicted in the countenances of most people; hence many persons of irreproachable cha∣racter and humane dispositions, who in other circumstances would have been very willing to assist their fellow crea∣tures, were deterred from entering on so perilous an un∣dertaking. The Health Commissioners, therefore, to whom the care of this Hospital was committed, had no choice. Nurses and attendants must be had, and as they could not procure the most proper persons, they were obliged to be contented with such as they could obtain.</P>
<P>The case, however, was now changed. People began to recover from the panic with which they had been struck, and notwithstanding every discouraging circumstance, ma∣ny were found whose humanity would not permit them to withhold from their fellow creatures that assistance which they in a similar situation had a right to expect; nurses of good character were accordingly found, and the former improper persons were dismissed. Doctor Bayley, the Health-Officer, whose character as a physician is too well known to require any panegyric, aided by two assistants, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Doctor Douglass and Doctor Gregory, attended on the spot, and in a short time the greatest order and regu∣larity was introduced; the patients were treated with the utmost care and tenderness; the nurses and attendants discharged their respective duties with fidelity; and <HI>Belle∣vue</HI> instead of being considered as the anti-chamber of the grave, began to be viewed, by many of the afflicted as a place where they stood a greater chance of recovery than any where else.</P>
<P>That cleanliness is not only very conducive to health, but that it contributes greatly to the removal of disorder from those who are afflicted, and also very much tends to prevent the spreading of infection amongst their attendants will scarcely be denied. The experience of every one who has been conversant amongst those afflicted with pe∣stilential disorders, in every age and in every country abundantly confirms this fact; and surely this excellent
<PB N="52" REF="035586_0051_1005F64BF7A8E6C0"/>
preservative and remedy was never better observed than here.</P>
<P>Upon the commissioners taking possession of this place, the walls, timber, and every part both inside and outside were whitewashed, and the practice of whitewashing the inside every week, ten days or fortnight, according to the season of the year, and number of sick, was steadily pur∣sued since its first establishment. Another practice never omitted was, that if at any time in the course of a person's being confined with fever, his bed, shirt or linen were stained or soiled by vomiting or otherwise, they were <HI>immediately</HI> removed and replaced with clean ones; be∣sides the linnen and bed clothes of the sick were usually changed every day or two, if even those extraordinary circumstances did not occur. These means, as a system of cleanliness, were steadily adhered to by the attendants at this Hospital.</P>
<P>The whole number of persons admitted from August 1st to 3d. November, since which time none have been received, was three hundred and eighty-nine, of whom two hundred and eighty-nine were from the city and one hundred seamen; of the former one hundred and seventy two died and one hundred and seventeen were discharged. The latter were more fortunate, for of them only thirty-three died and the other sixty-seven were discharged.</P>
<P>From the above statement, which may be depended up∣on as correct, the following question naturally occurs. How came it that a much greater proportion of seamen recovered at this Hospital, than of those sent thither from the city? The answer is this. The seamen were in ge∣neral sent therein the first stage of the disorder, whereas many of our citizens from the fears which they entertained of that Hospital, could not be prevailed upon to be re∣moved thither till they were past recovery. In confirma∣tion of this I may add that of a good many people whom I myself have seen previous to their being carried thither, by far the greater part of those who were removed on the first attack recovered, whereas to those who remained till the disorder had acquired a greater degree of malignancy little else was to be expected but death. Indeed several died within a few hours after their entrance in the Hospi∣tal and more than a third in two days. There is one
<PB N="53" REF="035586_0052_1005F64F72723AF8"/>
thing very remarkable with respect to the attendants at this Hospital, which ought not to be omitted. Their situati∣on to most people must no doubt have appeared peculiar∣ly dangerous, as they were literally surrounded with pesti∣lence. It so happened, however, that neither nurses, nor washerwomen caught the infection. The boatmen too be∣longing to the Health-Office, who entered the Hospital at all times and were not only engaged in bringing the sick from the city and shipping, but likewise in removing them from place to place, enjoyed a state of perfect health; and of those persons who accompanied their friends and rela∣tives, stayed with them and nursed them, there is not a sin∣gle instance of an individual being infected. In short, Dr. Douglass was the only person residing there who was seized with fever; but he had been in the habit of occasionally visiting his friends in the city, and three days previous to his being taken ill, had slept in a house the vicinity of which was highly infected; and it is more than probable that his sickness was occasioned by that cause.</P>
<P>From the above, and many other facts which might be mentioned, it amounts to a certainty that this fever will not spread in a <HI>pure air.</HI> For this reason the inhabitants of the country have little or no reason of being afraid to receive the sick who remove from town, nor of those who are taken ill with fever after leaving the city▪ for, as is observed by Mr. Noah Webster, junior, <HI>in his conclud∣ing observations to a collection of papers on the subject of bilious fevers,</HI> published in the year 1796. "The panic that seized the whole continent, when the disease in Phi∣ladelphia, is now found to have been needless and with∣out just cause; and it is presumed, that such inhuman caution and barbarous measures as were adopted on that occasion, will never again disgrace our country."</P>
<P>Having thus given an account of the Hospital at Belle∣vue, and of the treatment of the sick, I now proceed▪ to point out the manner of administering relief to such sick persons as could not be accommodated there, or the situ∣ation of whose persons or families rendered their removal improper or inconvenient.</P>
<P>With respect to accommodations there was no doubt a considerable difficulty previous to the erection of the two additional buildings which I have already mentioned; but
<PB N="54" REF="035586_0053_1005F65205F5D548"/>
these being compleated, that difficulty was entirely re∣moved.</P>
<P>When individuals, who had no families were seized with the disorder, and were incapable of providing for them∣selves the necessary relief, it was the wish of the commit∣tee that they should be removed to Bellevue as speedy as possible. By which means the progress of the disorder might be arrested, whilst the chance of their recovery was as great at least if not greater than if they had remained in the city. But to separate children from their parents, hus∣bands from their wives, or wives from their husbands, or in short to have removed contrary to their inclinations, a single individual from any family, where perhaps they had resolved to remain by each other, so the last extremity, would have been an act of the greatest inhumanity. For such, therefore, it was necessary that provision should be made by the committee.</P>
<P>They accordingly being sensible of the miserable situa∣tion to which the poor must be reduced by the suspension of all business and the distress they must suffer when at∣tacked by disease, devoted their sole and undivided at∣tention to their relief.</P>
<P>For this purpose they advertised in the public prints, that the more easily and effectually to answer the end of their benevolent appointment, they would daily attend at the Alms-House from 9 to 1 and from 3 to 6 afternoon, to receive the applications of the sick, the widow and or∣phan, or their friends in their behalf, and to grant such relief as the liberality of the Common Council of the city had directed.</P>
<P>The Common Council, at an early period of the dis∣order, had borrowed a sum of money to be appropriated towards the above benevolent purpose, and about the lat∣ter end of September, Mr. John Murray, junior, a re∣spectable merchant of this city, generously offered to the Committee to guarantee a farther loan of ten thousand dollars, if it should be wanted; but the charitable donati∣ons received from different parts of this state, from New-Jersey and Connecticut; and also from many of our own wealthy citizens rendered this measure unnecessary. By their beneficence and humanity the Committee were en∣abled to afford to the necessitous a considerable degree of
<PB N="55" REF="035586_0054_1005F65476DA2128"/>
comfort, of which they would otherwise have been de∣prived. Liberal donations of money, produce, &amp;c. (a list of which is annexed) were daily received and distributed as each particular case seemed to require.</P>
<P>As during the ravages of this dreadful disorder, medical aid was an object of the first concern, it may not be im∣proper to mention the manner in which the poor were ac∣commodated in this respect. Early in the sickness many of our most eminent physicians had le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the city, and seve∣ral of those who remained had paid the last debt to nature. Hence the business of practitioners was greatly increased, and the situation of the indigent became peculiarly dis∣tressing. The committee, therefore, employed three physicians to administer to the relief of such sick as unfor∣tunately became objects of their appointment, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Doc∣tors Hugh M'Lean, Daniel M. Hitchcock, and Adolphus C. L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt.</P>
<P>The extreme assiduity and humanity which these gentle∣men displayed in the discharge of their duty, is well known to the afflicted poor; and places their conduct in such a point of view as to be far above any panegyric of mine. To no person could their diligence be better known than to me, and in justice to them I think it my duty to declare that notwithstanding the great fatigue and danger to which they were continually exposed, they with the greatest ala∣crity daily sustained the perilous task of visiting and admi∣nistering the necessary medicine to hundreds of their afflic∣ted fellow creatures. From morning to night they were incessantly engaged; nor did any of them, when called up∣on to see a patient, even at the most unseasonable hours, hesitate a moment to wait upon them, let the disorder be ever so malignant. Thanks to heaven their valuable lives are spared, and long, very long, may they live in the grateful remembrance of their fellow citizens. How ma∣ny owe their safety to their skill and attention it is not easy to determine; but this far may be safely asserted, that there are many now in good health, who but for their skill and attention would have been tenants of the grave. But had the attention of the committee been confined to pro∣curing physicians for the sick, it would have been produc∣tive of little good, for I have known many cases where the husband and wife with some others of the family were
<PB N="56" REF="035586_0055_1005F65619BAD678"/>
so grievously afflicted as to be incapable of furnishing each other <HI>even</HI> with a cup of water.</P>
<P>For such persons nurses were therefore to be provided at the public expence; and here the same difficulty at first occurred in procuring good ones as at Bellevue. This, however, was soon got over, as the committee hav∣ing advertised that nurses of good character were wanted, to whom generous wages would be paid, a sufficient num∣ber of decent people readily offered their service. Some indeed were found to act improperly; but when the case was represented to the Committee, they were dismissed and others substituted in their stead.</P>
<P>But besides procuring nurses for the relief of the poor, the committee were frequently under the necessity of geting them for some of those in affluent circumstances, whose friends had probably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led, or who, if they remained, knew not to whom they should apply for the necessary help. To these, likewise, the committee directed their attention.</P>

The trustees of the Dispensary in their report on this interesting subject, make the following very judicious re∣mark, "The great proportion of cases of the Yellow Fe∣ver in this statement, whilst it affords the most undeniable evidence of the utility of the institution, is also an honor∣able proof of the talents and assiduity of their physician Doctor Hugh M'Lean, more especially when it is consi∣dered that the objects consisted of the poorest and most destitute class of citizens."</P>
<P>As the disorder continued to make farther progress, the committee found the calls on their humanity daily encrease.</P>
<P>The indigent sick were indeed supplied with medical aid and nurses; but it was necessary that provision should be made for their maintainance, and also for a number of families, the heads of which not being able to find any employment, were in the greatest distress.</P>
<P>With a view to relieve such persons, the committee established three repositories and cook shops, one at Cliff-street, another at No. 159 Chatham-street and the third <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the head of Division-street, from whence such indigent and distressed sick, as were deprived of the means of providing for themselves, were liberally supplied with soups, boiled meat, bread, candles, and other proper and necessary arti∣cles suitable to their situation.</P>
<P>Perhaps, in such a calamity, no establishments could have been devised of more general utility than these cook houses; the situation of many of the sick being such, as would not admit of their nurses leaving them to dress the necessary provisions; to which it may be added, that if money had been given to some of them for the purchase of necessaries, it would have very probably been expended for articles, which, instead of contributing to the relief of the sick, might have been highly detrimental, or it might have been appropriated to their own use. I may likewise observe, that if pecuniary aid had been been afforded to some of the more thoughtless and dissipated poor, they would very probably have spent it, in procuring for them∣selves a temporary gratification, whilst their starving fami∣lies remained neglected.</P>
<P>In confirmation of this, I shall adduce one instance out of a few others, of a similar nature which came under my
<PB N="58" REF="035586_0057_1005F65C3ABB00F0"/>
own observation. The wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of a person whom I had oc∣casion to see, in the discharge of my duty, was dangerously ill of the prevailing fever. She lay in a damp cellar and was destitute of every necessary and comfort. Of money entrusted to me by the committee for the relief of the dis∣tressed, I therefore left with the husband two dollars, one of which I wished to be appropriated to the purchase of half a load of wood, and the other for such little articles as might be immediately necessary for his wife and child. I called again at the house a few hours after, but instead of finding the money applied as I expected, I found the man in a state of intoxication, and totally regardless and insen∣sible of the situation of his afflicted wife, who was then in the agonies of death. She died soon after; the funeral was conducted by strangers, by whom likewise their child about six years of age, was carried to the Alms-house, whilst the unhappy husband remained in a state of insensi∣bility, knowing or caring very little about what had hap∣pened.</P>
<P>I am happy, however, in observing, that such remarks must be understood as applying to very few, for almost in every instance, parents and children; husbands and wives, and in short all those living in the same family were dispo∣sed to contribute to the very utmost in their power, to∣wards the relief of their afflicted relatives.</P>
<P>The number of those, who received their daily subsist∣ence from these cook houses, during the greatest part of the calamity, amounted to between 1600 and 2000 per∣sons, of whom many were helpless sick, widows and or∣phans; whilst eight hundred people were, at the same time, supported in the Alms-house, out of funds provided by law.</P>
<P>But the ample donations and very liberal contributions, which as I have already observed, were collected in many places, for our relief, whilst it reflected the highest honour, on the donors, and demanded our warmest gratitude, also enabled the committee to relieve many of the distressed in a different manner.</P>
<P>The cook-houses were certainly highly useful; but there were many sick and indigent, who lived at a consider∣able distance from either of them, to whom it would have been very inconvenient to have procured from thence the necessary provisions▪ and the circumstances of others
<PB N="59" REF="035586_0058_1005F65EC54C1FF8"/>
seemed likewise to require assistance of a different na∣ture▪</P>
<P>The produce which came from various parts of the country for the relief of the indigent, except what was sent to the cook-houses by order of the committee, was depo∣sited in a store opposite the Alms-house; from whence upwards of five hundred families were from time to time relieved by donations in necessaries, such as beef, pork, mutton, flour, fowls, indian meal, potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. For the relief of these, the committee likewise expended a great deal of money, by giving them occasionally such small sums as the situation of their families seemed to require; and several widows, who upon the death of their husbands, wished to remove to that place in the country where their relatives and friends resided; being destitute of the means of carrying themselves and children thither, were also assisted.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned, that the committee when first organized, had advertised, that they would meet daily at the Alms-house, from 9 to 1, and 3 to 6, for the pur∣pose of attending to the benevolent object of their ap∣pointment; but, in a short time the applications▪ of the sick and indigent became so exceedingly numerous, that they were not able, during these hours, to determine on all their requests. They, therefore, assembled during the greatest part of this awful visitation at about eight in the morning, and continued their sitting, till seven, and some∣times eight, in the evening, allowing themselves only a bare half hour for dinner. For my part, when I think of the extreme fatigue and danger which these gentlemen encoun∣tered, and the constant risque they ran of catching infec∣tion, many of those individuals who came thither to solicit assistance, having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever upon them, I consider their preser∣vation, if not miraculous, at least highly providential. Two of them, indeed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Alderman Gabriel Furman and Alderman Theophilus Beekman, as also our worthy May∣or, whose attention to the duties of his office during this distressing period, is above all praise, were attacked by the pestilence, but, thanks to the Almighty, they soon re∣covered, and regardless of danger, immediately repaired to their post, and along with their colleagues went through the fatiguing business of their appointment with alacrity to the last.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="035586_0059_1005F661A1F8D2B8"/>
It need scarcely be observed, that the task of the com∣mittee in administering relief, in such a situation, would in many cases be delicate, embarrassing and disagreeable; for had they given indiscriminately to every person who solicited aid, liberal as the contributions of our fellow ci∣tizens were, they would have been productive of little utility to those who were really in need.</P>
<P>The donations were certainly given for the relief of the indigent sick, and for widows and orphans of this descrip∣tion; but such was the meanness of some possessed of con∣siderable property, and even proprietors of houses, that they too became applicants for part of a fund exclusively intended for the relief of the helpless.</P>
<P>It was fortunate that every individual of the Committee were either natives of this city, or at least had a long time resided in it. They were, of course, generally qualified to judge how far the tales of woe related by many of the ap∣plicants for charity were true. There were, however, numbers with whom they could not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e acquainted, parti∣cularly foreigners, who had only for a short time resided in this country.</P>
<P>To ascertain the truth of their complaints, when they appeared doubtful, the Committee had several attendants, part of whose business it was to repair to the respective re∣sidences of such applicants, to enquire into their circum∣stances and to report accordingly. It was, likewise, the duty of these persons to visit the indigent sick, to examine into their situations, to represent their cases, to relieve their immediate wants out of money entrusted to them for that purpose, and in short to do every thing which they might be directed by the Committee, or their own pru∣dence might suggest, towards the mitigation of the suffer∣ings of individuals, or to stop the progress of the deadly pestilence.</P>
<P>The situation of these men was, no doubt, perilous in the extreme; but such was the goodness of Divine Pro∣vidence, that out of eleven so employed by the Health Committee and the Health Commissioners, one only lost his life, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Mr. Wynant Mitchell, whose character can be summed up in a very few words. He was an industri∣ous, benevolent and honest man, and has left a wife and three children to lament his loss. Mr. Munmouth Purdy, who volunteered in the same service likewise fell a victim of his philanthropy.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="035586_0060_1005F6640F8F3338"/>
Having thus described the manner in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he poor were relieved throughout the city, it may not be improper to direct the attention of my readers to the situation of the poor prisoners in the <HI>Debtor's Apartment,</HI> or what is com∣monly called the <HI>New Gaol.</HI> The disorder, which pre∣vailed more or less, in the city, likewise made its appear∣ance here: It, however, in a short time entirely subsided, owing in a great measure to the indefatigable industry of Mr. William W. Parker, the jailor, in cleaning and wash∣ing the different apartments, by which means the farther spreading of the infection was prevented.</P>
<P>The situation of the debtors at the commencement of the general calamity afforded a picture of distress and horror scarcely equalled by any thing we have hitherto seen represented. Their number at first amounted to 163 and whilst others were enjoying advantages resulting from the wholesome laws of the state, these individuals were pent up in the midst of pestilence, deprived of the privilege of seeking their self preservation, exposed to the unsatiated revenge of individuals, and seemed in every respect deli∣vered up as victims to the malignancy of the common enemy.</P>
<P>But the danger of infection was not the only evil to which these unfortunate men were exposed; for it is well known that though a person confined for crimes is support∣ed by the state, a poor debtor has no other dependence than on the benevolence of his friends and the charity of the Humane Society: But upon the approach of this ge∣neral distress, many of their friends, who would have wil∣lingly assisted them had fled, others were sick, and sever∣als no doubt so reduced by the general calamity as to be scarcely capable of supporting themselves. In this situa∣tion, therefore, not only pestilence, with scarcely a proba∣ble chance of escape, but also famine stared them in the face.</P>
<P>Their case was represented to the Committee by Mr. Parker, and they were immediately supplied with plenty of provisions; and this was from time to time repeated during the existence of the fever, as often as their necessi∣ties seemed to require.</P>
<P>But the prisoners were indebted to Mr. Parker for exer∣tions of a different nature. By his personal assiduities—
<PB N="62" REF="035586_0061_1005F665A1FD56F8"/>
by his feeling representations to humane creditors, the number of the prisoners, which, as I have already menti∣oned, amounted at first to 163, were towards the close of the disorder reduced to 39, by which means their num∣bers were lessened and consequently the danger. Nor was his benevolence confined to personal exertions; for he not only in most instances sacrificed his own exertions to the general good, by relinquishing his fees, which were his chief support, but in several instances he did the duty of others by contributing himself towards the payment of lawyers fees, where they only detained the poor.</P>
<P>Such render treatment, such humane care of indigent and afflicted prisoners cannot be too highly applauded, and whilst it is the lot of unfortunate individuals to be imprison∣ed for debt, it must be a great consolation to them to be placed under the care of a man possessed of so much hu∣manity as Mr. Parker. Certainly such conduct ought to be mentioned not only as a tribute of applause; but as a stimulus to others who may be similarly situated, to do the same. In a word, Mr. Parker's treatment of his pri∣soners, when known, will ever meet with the approbation of all good citizens.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Part of this, with respect to Mr. Parker's humanity, appeared in some of our public prints under a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nonymous signature; but from such a source nothing can be averred with certainty. It, however, gives me pleasure to inform my readers, that from what I have learnt from gentlemen of veracity, who, during part of this awful period were prisoners, no man could have act∣ed better than Mr. Parker in such a situation.</NOTE></P>
<P>I shall now conclude this article, with respect to the poor, by a few general observations. During the whole of this calamitous period, such was the extraordinary liberality of our fellow citizens in granting donations; and such the unremitting attention of the Committee in distributing them, that notwithstanding the distressed were by far more numerous than at any previous period in this city; yet there was no individual at a loss for the necessaries of life, for medical aid, or for nurses, provided the case was made known to the Committee, who not only fat with unweari∣ed patience from morning to night to listen to the incess∣ant applications of hundreds; but as has been already ob∣served, had people employed to seek out for objects of distress.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="035586_0062_1005F6686E692250"/>
There is one class of distressed objects, whom, as I omitted to mention in the preceding pages it may not be improper to introduce here, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the children of necessi∣tous persons, whose parents were cut off by death. Mr. Mathew Carey, in his history of the Malignant Fever preva∣lent in Philadelphia in the year 1793, observes, that the Bettering-House (Alms-House) there, in which such help∣less objects had been usually placed, was barred against them; "Many of these little innocents (says he) were ac∣tually suffering for want of even common necessaries. The death of their parents and protectors, which should have been the strongest recommendation to public charity, was the very reason of their distress, and of their being shun∣ned as a pestilence. The case, however, was widely dif∣ferent with us; for no sooner had the parents of these lit∣tle ones expired, than if they were not taken care of by some of their friends or relations, there was always some persons of humanity who would represent their ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to the Committee, by whose orders they were immediately re∣moved to a part in the Alms-House appropriated to their reception.</P>
<P>By the above remark, however, I would by no means wish to be understood as throwing any reflection against the citizens of Philadelphia for being deficient in point of humanity. On the contrary, many of the inhabitants dis∣played a benevolence and philanthropy which in so awful a period may be equalled, but never can be surpassed. But the <HI>Yellow Fever</HI> was at that time a new disorder, or at least little known in the United States: and terrific as it really was, both in its appearance and effects, it still excited more terror than was necessary or just. Hence in many cases humanity, friendship, parental and filial affection were all swallowed up in a regard to self preservation; and this will ever be the case in any country when an all de∣vouring pestilence makes its <HI>first</HI> appearance. But in the last autumn the disorder was better known▪ as it had re∣peatedly visited some of our most populous cities, and ex∣perience had sufficiently evinced, that such persons as con∣fined themselves to their houses, run little, if any greater risque of infection than those who were constantly conversant amongst the sick. Hence, if it should be the Divine plea∣sure, that we should again be visited either here or in any
<PB N="64" REF="035586_0063_1005F66AE8EE8018"/>
other place of the United States, by this awful disorder, its horrors will, in all probability, be greatly alleviated, as few will be found so timorous as to be unwilling to dis∣charge the duties of humanity to the distressed.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this article, I cannot help taking no∣tice of the distress in which some poor people were involv∣ed in consequence of the rigid manner in which some un∣feeling landlords have exacted their rents. Forgetful that their poor tenants had been sick, that they had large fami∣lies and that they had been able to earn nothing during a calamitous season of three months, they notwithstanding insisted on the immediate payment of the original stipula∣ted bargain: In consequence of which, the little property which these poor people possessed were sold by the consta∣ble at vendu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and they exposed in consequence thereof to the utmost distress. It was natural in this time of ge∣neral calamity for every unfortunate individual to look up to the committee for relief; the donations, were in∣tended for the immediate exigence of the indigent and sick, not for the payment of house-rent; for, liberal as they were, had the committee thought proper to appropriate them in this manner, they would have speedily been absorbed in such a manner as to fill the pockets of the rich, whilst the poor would have remained in the same state of misery and distress.</P>
<P>But whilst some landlords acted with the utmost rapa∣city, the conduct of many was such as reflects the greatest honour upon their characters. Of these some forgave the rent for one quarter altogether; and others have consider∣ably indulged their tenants by procrastinating the payment till such time as they should find it convenient. Men of this last description have the ineffable satisfaction of having contributed to the relief of the distressed, whilst the former being actuated by an insatiable desire of gain, seek only for happiness in their gold, which, if they had not been determined to be blind, they could have easily seen, would contribute very little towards relieving them <HI>from the yellow fever or any other pestilential disorder.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A LIST OF THE NAMES OF THE PERSONS INTERRED IN THE SEVERAL BURYING GROUNDS IN THE CITY OF NEW-YORK, AND AT BELLEVUE, AND POTTERS-FIELD,</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>FROM AUGUST 1—TO NOVEMBER 14, 1798.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE the Reader begins to peruse the following list, I would wish to apprize him of the materials from which it is composed. They are the books of the different sextons and other persons having the charge of burying grounds in this city, at Potter-Field and Bellevue. It has however unfortunately happened that the sextons of two of the smallest congregations were absent during a great part of the calamity, and in these the names of the dead were only given by me∣mory, and in other instances, the books have not been kept with that accuracy which could have been wished. To ascertain with precision the names of all the deceased, their occupations, &amp;c. I have used my utmost exertions. With this view I have compared the books of the sextons with the list kept by the Health-Com∣mittee, and wherever there was a difference, I have, by personal application to the friends of the deceased, endeavoured as far as possible to rectify the mistake, and also where the orthography appeared erroneous, to correct it as well as I could▪ and by annexing to the names, the trade, occupation, age, place of nativity o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some other circumstance to point out the particular person intended and thus to remove the doubts of people at a distance. But whatever pains may be taken in a thing of this sort, it cannot be expected that it will be entirely free from errors or defects: but I trust it will be found as compleat, as considering the difficulties at∣tending it, could be expected and that in almost every instance it will be found satisfactory.</P>
<P>C. Annexed to some Names denotes that the Person died in the Country. The words printed in Italic after any name, denotes the native country of that person.</P>
