<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>MAY I be canoniz'd for a Saint, if I know what Apology to make for this dull Piece of House∣hold Stuff, any more than he that first invented the <HI>Horn-Book;</HI> all that can be said in its Defence, is, the <HI>Muses</HI> hath taken as much Pains in framing their brit∣tle Ware, as <HI>Bruin</HI> does in licking her Cubs into Shape: And should that carping Cur, <HI>Momus,</HI> but breath on it, <HI>(vah! miseris,)</HI> we are quite undone; since one Blast from the Critick's Mouth, wou'd raise more Flaws in this <HI>Looking-Glass,</HI> than there be Circles in the <HI>Sphere;</HI> and when all is said and done, the <HI>Reader</HI> will judge just as he pleases. Well, if it be the Fate of these Sheets, to supply the Use of Waste Paper, the <HI>Author</HI> has done his Part, and is determined to write on, as often as his Inclination or Interest shall prompt him.</P>

<L>Without the help of Savage Hands.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS is our Case, and will, I fear,</L>
<L>Grow worse and worse, the Course we steer.</L>
<L>Are grown too populous to thrive,</L>
<L>Upon a nauseous Vegetive.</L>
<L>And tho' the Law remains in Force,</L>

<L>A <HI>Jubilee</HI> once in Five Year.</L>

<L>I will another <HI>Scheme</HI> advance,</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="003266_0024_0FF02F64ECCC23C0"/>
Will do, says the projecting <HI>Don:</HI></L>
<L>And thus in serious Tone went on.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>ALL Taxables work in the Ground,</L>
<L>Both <HI>Male</HI> and <HI>Female</HI> that are sound,</L>
<L>Should be allow'd <HI>Six Hundred</HI> Weight,</L>
<L>Of <HI>Sotweed</HI> good, and fit for Freight,</L>
<L>To plant; and he that dares tend more,</L>
<L>Shou'd wear the broad R on his Door:</L>
<L>Remain in <HI>Misericordia,</HI></L>
<L>'Till he the Fine in Specie pay.</L>
<L><HI>Merchants</HI> likewise, our Staple buy,</L>
<L>Shou'd be oblig'd in <HI>Currency,</HI></L>
<L>Or <HI>Bills,</HI> for the Sixth Part, to pay</L>
<L>Upon the Nail, without Delay:</L>
<L>The rest in Goods, at common Sale,</L>
<L>Or be committed, without Bail.</L>
<L>And that we may the better thrive;</L>
<L>Which is the Business of the <HI>Hive,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="003266_0025_0FF02F668685C8D8"/>
We ought conveniently to dwell</L>
<L>In <HI>Towns</HI> and <HI>Cities,</HI> buy and sell</L>
<L>Our Merchandize at publick Scales.</L>
<L>And as it often rains and hails,</L>
<L><HI>Warehouses</HI> should in common be</L>
<L>Erected; where, for a small Fee,</L>
<L>Our <HI>Staple</HI> would be convey'd thither,</L>
<L>Securely screen'd from stormy Weather.</L>
<L>There, free from anxious needless Care,</L>
<L>We may, at Leisure, vend our Ware;</L>
<L>Barter for Goods, as hath been said:</L>
<L>And ready Cash, that must be paid,</L>
<L>Our publick Duties to defray,</L>
<L>And old Arrears of <HI>Quit-Rents</HI> pay.</L>
<L>A Tax equivalent has laid</L>
<L>Upon <HI>Tobacco,</HI> must be paid,</L>

<L>In Bills, before it quits the Port.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="003266_0026_0FF02F6AB8D92190"/>
But what is worst for <HI>Patent</HI> Lands,</L>
<L>By others held, it Debtor stands.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I must confess, 'tis just and true,</L>
<L>That CAESAR should be paid his Due:</L>
<L>But one Man to monopolize</L>
<L>More Land, than yet he occupies,</L>
<L>And Foreigners the <HI>Quit-Rents</HI> pay,</L>
<L>In <HI>Sterling</HI> Coin, is not fair Play:</L>
<L>A Grievance ought to be suppress'd,</L>
<L>By Ways and Means, CAESAR knows best.</L>
<L>Thus, has our <HI>Staple</HI> of small Worth,</L>
<L>To many Evils given Birth:</L>
<L>That like <HI>Ill Weeds,</HI> unhappy Case,</L>
<L>As says the Proverb, <HI>grows a-pace;</HI></L>
<L>Which, to prevent, <HI>Physicians</HI> say,</L>
<L>Our Laws chalk out a wholesome Way;</L>
<L>But what is so, to speak the Truth,</L>
<L>Does not agree with every Tooth;</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="003266_0027_0FF02F6C46085B78"/>
Nor will the strictest penal Laws,</L>
<L>Contriv'd by Statesmen, strike the Cause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE only Way I know to heal</L>
<L>The ling'ring State of Common-weal,</L>
<L>Is to ordain all Taxes be,</L>
<L>As well the <HI>Priest,</HI> as <HI>Lawyer'</HI>s Fee,</L>
<L>Hereafter paid in <HI>Currency;</HI></L>
<L>Or with the Produce of our Grounds,</L>

<L>SCARCE had the <HI>Goddess</HI> of the <HI>Night,</HI></L>
<L>Resign'd her Throne to <HI>Phoebus</HI> bright;</L>
<L>When calling for a Quart Decanter</L>
<L>Of <HI>Sack,</HI> I thus harangu'd the <HI>Planter:</HI></L>
<L>Rise, <HI>Oroonoko,</HI> rise, said I,</L>
<L>And let us drink Prosperity</L>
<L>To <HI>Maryland,</HI> before we part;</L>
<L>Starting, says he, with all my Heart.</L>
<L>I wish my Country very well:</L>
<L>And tho' the PRESS with Schemes does swell,</L>
<L>To make us thrive at Home the better,</L>
<L>As <HI>P. P.</HI> tells us in his Letter,</L>
<L>If <HI>Planters</HI> wou'd be rul'd by me,</L>
<L>I will their best Physician be:</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="003266_0029_0FF02F725AD65898"/>
Prescribe the Means, wou'd, I am sure,</L>
<L>If rightly apply'd, work a Cure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>FIRST, let them <HI>Swamps</HI> and <HI>Marshes</HI> drain,</L>
<L>Fit to receive all Sorts of <HI>Grain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hemp, Flax, Rice;</HI> and let <HI>Cotton</HI> here,</L>
<L>In all its <HI>Autumn</HI> Dress appear:</L>
<L>One Bale of each, more Pence will yield</L>
<L>In <HI>Europe,</HI> than the richest Field</L>
<L>Of <HI>Oroonoko,</HI> I am sure,</L>
<L>If nicely handled in the Cure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NEXT, may their Industry be seen,</L>
<L>In <HI>Pastures</HI> fat, and <HI>Meadows</HI> green;</L>
<L>Where <HI>Sheep</HI> and <HI>Cattle</HI> manure Ground,</L>
<L>In mighty Numbers shou'd abound.</L>
<L>The <HI>Hides</HI> will for their Grazing pay,</L>
<L>And <HI>Wool</HI> Misfortunes keep in Play,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="003266_0030_0FF02F781FC03C20"/>
Of those, must either work or starve,</L>
<L>Oblig'd for Wife and Bearns to carve:</L>
<L><HI>Mechanicks</HI> then of ev'ry Sort,</L>
<L>And <HI>Mariners</HI> wou'd here resort,</L>
<L>When they hear <HI>Money</HI> circulates,</L>
<L>Within our Towns and City Gates.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT as this Land, like <HI>Albion'</HI>s Isle,</L>
<L>Is compos'd of a different Soil,</L>
<L>So some shou'd <HI>plant,</HI> some drive the <HI>Plow;</HI></L>
<L>And such as <HI>Hemp</HI> and <HI>Flax</HI> know how</L>
<L>To dress, shou'd exercise the Brake;</L>
<L>But not permitted be to make</L>
<L>More Grain, or other Merchandize,</L>
<L>Than may their Hands and Stocks suffice:</L>
<L>Nor shou'd Crop Merchants correspond,</L>
<L>On t'other Side the <HI>Herring-Pond,</HI></L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT then, perhaps, it will be said,</L>
<L>By those (to venture) are afraid,</L>
<L>How shall these floating Castles be</L>
<L>Equipp'd, and fitted for the Sea?</L>
<L>A Doubt not difficult to solve,</L>
<L>Wou'd such (in Pence abound) resolve,</L>
<L>As the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> did of old,</L>
<L>To plow the Seas in Vessels bold;</L>
<L>Which <HI>Draft-men</HI> best know how to mould.</L>
<L>Materials here, of every kind,</L>
<L>May soon be found, were Youth inclin'd,</L>

The Woods with <HI>Timber Trees</HI> abound;</L>
<L>Near <HI>North-East, Iron</HI> may be found,</L>
<L>The best that ever yet was made,</L>

<L>From <HI>Hemp</HI> and <HI>Flax,</HI> may <HI>Canvas Sails</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Ropes</HI> be drawn, that seldom fails,</L>
<L>In stormy Winds, to act their Part,</L>
<L>If twisted well by human Art.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOTHING is wanting to compleat,</L>
<L>Fit for the Sea, a trading Fleet,</L>
<L>But Industry and Resolution,</L>
<L>Wou'd quickly heal our Constitution,</L>
<L>Were we unanimously bent,</L>
<L>Impending Evils to prevent.</L>
<L>Can ne'er think to grow Rich and Great,</L>
<L>But by an Independant State;</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="003266_0033_0FF02F7F763263C0"/>
Or hope to thrive, unless we try,</L>
<L>With Canvas Wings abroad to fly.</L>
<L>We then about the World might roam;</L>
<L>See how our <HI>Staple</HI> sells at Home;</L>
<L><HI>Barbadoes</HI> and <HI>Jamaica</HI> drain;</L>
<L>Bring hither, from the Mines of <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Moidores, Pistoles,</HI> and <HI>Cobbs,</HI> full Weight;</L>
<L>The very best of <HI>Spanish Plate.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT whether, with us they wou'd stay,</L>
<L>Is a hard Task for me to say;</L>
<L>Since Current Coin, in ev'ry State,</L>
<L>Invented was, to circulate:</L>

<L>As <HI>Luna'</HI>s Motion to retard,</L>

<L><PB N="26" REF="003266_0034_0FF02F81022729A8"/>
Oblige it like the constant <HI>Sun,</HI></L>
<L>Beyond its <HI>Tropicks</HI> not to run,</L>
<L><HI>Potomack</HI> River, (that's to say)</L>
<L>And <HI>Delaware'</HI>s exuberant Bay.</L>
<L>But <HI>Copper-Coin,</HI> like vagrant <HI>Cain,</HI></L>
<L>Wou'd never wander into <HI>Spain,</HI></L>
<L>Or long in Misers Bags remain.</L>
<L>This said, the Glass he upwards threw,</L>
<L>And bending backwards, strongly drew.</L>
<L>I pledg'd his Worship in a Brimmer;</L>
<L>And thus retorted on the Sinner.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These Sentiments, I must confess,</L>
<L>Much Zeal for publick Good express:</L>
<L>But when all's done, as hath been said,</L>
<L>It's Industry must force a Trade:</L>
