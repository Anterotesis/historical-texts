<HEAD>RIGHTS OF ASSES.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AS lately at a Muirland fair,</L>
<L>Where cadgers, tinkers, thieves, repair,</L>
<L>With many others of like classes;</L>
<L>And most of them had with them Asses.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To see how best they might devise,</L>
<L>To carry off some lusty prize;</L>
<L>The masters went to bouze together,</L>
<L>And left their beasts among the heather;</L>
<L>Where, after picking scanty supper,</L>
<L>Each Ass sat down upon his crupper:</L>
<L>I quite forgot to count them o'er,</L>
<L>But think there might be near threescore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A DARING Ass presum'd to mention,</L>
<L>That now they ought to hold Convention;</L>
<L>And first, he mov'd to chuse a Preses,</L>
<L>(For there's some order among Asses:)</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="026091_0003_0FCFACA94C84F8A8"/>
This done, with more than Asses fire,</L>
<L>He rose, and audience did desire.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HE said, my friends, my fellow Asses,</L>
<L>Regard we nought what round us passes;</L>
<L>How other folks their rights maintain,</L>
<L>While we're opprest and ne'er complain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE sacred writers have reported,</L>
<L>How Patriarchs our service courted;</L>
<L>We then ate corn, or graz'd in meadows,</L>
<L>But now our riders seldom feed us:</L>
<L>When we for corn to Egypt went,</L>
<L>When Jacob's sons were thither sent,</L>
<L>They trudg'd beside us on their feet,</L>
<L>And we ate as our masters ate.</L>
<L>But horses now in every land,</L>
<L>Stand in the stalls where we should stand;</L>
<L>Great folks now keep vast numbers by them,</L>
<L>Altho' "forbid to multiply them:"</L>
<L>To us, one hearty feed's a stranger,</L>
<L>While they are full at hack and manger.</L>
<L>The horse, of more majestic mien,</L>
<L>With coach and harness in his train,</L>
<L>They say, can learn his duty fasten;</L>
<L>But, where's the horse e'er taught his master?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MY friends, we have been long abus'd,</L>
<L>And for the meanest drudg'ry us'd,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="026091_0004_0FCFACA70B4089F8"/>
While horses have been kept for pleasure,</L>
<L>And take their airings at their leisure.</L>
<L>Of old, my friends, it was not thus,</L>
<L>For every great man rode his Ass;</L>
<L>And tho' not fram'd to lead in battle,</L>
<L>Yet we were deem'd most useful cattle.</L>
<L>Now horses get what we deserve,</L>
<L>And we are left to steal or starve;</L>
<L>Come then, my friends, my hearty bloods,</L>
<L>Let's rise and kick them from their studs;</L>
<L>Our cause is just. A few campaigns</L>
<L>Will surely ease us of our chains.</L>
<L>He ceas'd:—Each Ass stretch'd out his crest,</L>
<L>And bray'd applause, and speaker blest.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SAVE an old cautious, mod'rate Cuddie,</L>
<L>Who said he had it from his goodie,</L>
<L>To learn to brook some small restraint,</L>
<L>For folks were happy, if content.</L>
<L>I own, my friends, we're not's we have been,</L>
<L>Asses have many better days seen;</L>
<L>But if we look around, we'll see</L>
<L>That others are as bad as we.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE former speaker talks of horses;</L>
<L>What creature under heaven worse is?</L>
<L>Do ye not see him plow the field?</L>
<L>And we eat what his labours yield:</L>
<L>By him we have our hay and straw,</L>
<L>Tho' whiles his litter we must gnaw,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="026091_0005_0FCFACA5AC3C3BE8"/>
And, tho' our skins be not so sleek,</L>
<L>Yet some get corn once in a week.</L>
<L>'Tis true, he boasts of birth and blood,</L>
<L>And sprung from this, or that Lord's stud;</L>
<L>But see ye not how much he's pain'd,</L>
<L>By spurs he's driven, by bits restrain'd:</L>
<L>See, from his sides how springs the blood,</L>
<L>And oft he faints upon the road:</L>
<L>See what he's forc'd to draw from Leith,</L>
<L>And suff'ring strokes much worse than death,</L>
<L>Unless beyond his strengh he draws,</L>
<L>Nor lifts, from morn to night, his jaws.</L>
<L>At other times, he must gainsay not,</L>
<L>But face a cannon or a bay'net;</L>
<L>Compar'd with these, we live in peace,</L>
<L>Our lives are lives of happiness.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YET more, my friends, if we but trace</L>
<L>Our breth'ren of the human race;</L>
<L>I say, if we but view those great ones,</L>
<L>Ev'n those who boast the birth of Britons:</L>
<L>View them with care, and ye will see,</L>
<L>That they are more opprest than we.</L>
<L>See how their rulers do oppress them,</L>
<L>And strain their wits how to assess them,</L>
<L>Soon as they see the light of day,</L>
<L>They for that light must taxes pay;</L>
<L>Nor yet can one a Christian be,</L>
<L>Until the King has got his fee;</L>
<L>Nor can be buried when they're dead,</L>
<L>Unless their rulers first are feed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="026091_0006_0FCFACA40B955118"/>
<L>I'VE often heard the farmers say.</L>
<L>(Besides what they to landlords pay)</L>
<L>From ev'ry boll there goes a firlot,</L>
<L>To feed some drone, or great man's harlot.</L>
<L>The horse he feeds, he cannot ride,</L>
<L>'Till first a tax for him be paid;</L>
<L>With tax on beer, and tax on malt,</L>
<L>With tax on spirits and on salt:</L>
<L>With tax on coaches, servants, rents,</L>
<L>On all these taxes—<HI>ten per cents.</HI></L>
<L>And, (what is stranger still to say)</L>
<L>Tax'd if he should those taxes pay;</L>
<L>Tax'd if he pay his honest debt,</L>
<L>With stamps for this sum, stamps for that:</L>
<L>Tax'd before he dare kill a hare,</L>
<L>Either with dog, or gun, or snare;</L>
<L>Tax'd if o'er pot the news do chat,</L>
<L>And licences for this and that:</L>
<L>With tax on hats, on gloves, and shoes,</L>
<L>Tax'd for the road on which he goes.</L>
<L>For physic tax'd—and tax'd for law;</L>
<L>Tax'd if his wife lie in the straw.</L>
<L>Thus, well and hearty, or relax'd,</L>
<L>Alive, or dead, he must be tax'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THESE taxes, when they count them o'er,</L>
<L>Amount to millions near a score;</L>
<L>And of these millions, not a few,</L>
<L>Are paid to bribe a venal crew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="026091_0007_0FCFACA2D2F6C838"/>
<L>BESIDES these ills, the folks in towns,</L>
<L>Are whiles rode down by rude dragoons.</L>
<L>See towns laid under martial law,</L>
<L>Lest boys shou'd burn a whisp of straw!</L>
<L>And if they shou'd resent such deeds,</L>
<L>They'll soon send bullets, thro' their heads;</L>
<L>Or try for life a Brewer's Beast,</L>
<L>For only joining in the jest;</L>
<L>And some are sent o'er seas, they tell us,</L>
<L>Where they'll be eaten by their fellows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THESE ills, and thousands more than these,</L>
<L>Are saddl'd on the human race;</L>
<L>And tho' they're "wiser far than we,"</L>
<L>Ye see how they to these agree,</L>
<L>Nor ever raise such strange confusions,</L>
<L>But please themselves with <HI>Constitutions.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE toils of war we can't endure,</L>
<L>Its good's a risk, its ills are sure;</L>
<L>Then cease ye from their fav'rite horses,</L>
<L>And be not doom'd to human curses;</L>
<L>Lest for assistance they may seek</L>
<L>That <HI>Tool</HI> of <HI>Tyrants, blust'ring Bruns'ick,</HI></L>
<L>Who, doubtless, shortly with his Chassieurs,</L>
<L>Wou'd come in to increase our pressures.</L>
<L>Ye know they're swifter on the road,</L>
<L>Besides, their heels are iron shod;</L>
<L>Then we'll be driv'n from town to town.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="026091_0008_0FCFACA151E58718"/>
And where they find us, ride us down;</L>
<L>They'll eat the fodder of each Ass,</L>
<L>Nor leave one particle of grass.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>HERE Cuddie bow'd, and then sat down,</L>
<L>And now a gen'ral hiss went round.</L>
<L>Some said, he makes a speech at least</L>
<L>As long as half a Pension List.</L>
<L>Some said, he seems design'd by Fate,</L>
<L>To be a Minister of State:</L>
<L>Some said, he well might grace the Treas'ry,</L>
<L>To find examples of our misery:</L>
<L>Some said, he seems a vast profound Ass,</L>
<L>And some, a lousy, <HI>Hairy, Dun'd-Ass:</HI></L>
<L>Some said, to live, he is not fit,</L>
<L>And some cried hurl him to a PITT.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AT last this clam'rous tumult ceases,</L>
<L>On hearing ORDER from the Preses,</L>
<L>Who said, to hear, he would be glad,</L>
<L>A sober speech. One rose, and said,</L>
<L>Altho' of war I'm not a liker,</L>
<L>Yet I agree with the first speaker.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>MY friends, we have been long degraded,</L>
<L>Our rights these horses have invaded,</L>
<L>(They, each day, have their double ration,</L>
<L>While we do pine in mere <HI>starvation</HI>)</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="026091_0009_0FCF8C516BC6AE28"/>
We ought our rights for to regain,</L>
<L>And with our lives these rights maintain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE world has had its darksome nights,</L>
<L>Now every one perceives his rights;</L>
<L>Ev'n Man, who should know better things,</L>
<L>Have long been dup'd by Priests and Kings</L>
<L>Have been led captive at their will,</L>
<L>For fear of either hemp or hell;</L>
<L>Now wish to banish pension'd drones,</L>
<L>Ev'n Kings now sit on tott'ring thrones.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YE see, my friends, how that the Franks,</L>
<L>Have drawn their heads out of the branks,</L>
<L>They all distinctions have forbidden,</L>
<L>Nor longer will they be Priest-ridden;</L>
<L>The Pope no more can damn their souls,</L>
<L>They laugh at him and all his bulls.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YE likewise see, in civil matters,</L>
<L>They have broke off their iron fetters:</L>
<L>Tho' they were long in darkness held,</L>
<L>That darkness now, is near dispell'd.</L>
<L>A brighter sun dispels their mist,</L>
<L>(They say their sun rose in the West)</L>
<L>They now the light of Freedom see,</L>
<L>And boast of strict Equality:</L>
<L>Now what they have can call their own,</L>
<L>Nor dread they thunders from a throne.</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="026091_0010_0FCFAC9E467D5C98"/>
None now upon their rights dare trample;</L>
<L>Why should not we take their example?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE former speaker talks of Bruns'ick,</L>
<L>But who for him now cares a broom-stick?</L>
<L>My friends, ye plainly see that he's</L>
<L>An Ass that's dup'd by refugees.</L>
<L>If ever he among us come,</L>
<L>We'll soon find means to send him home;</L>
<L>We'll gather round him in vast clusters,</L>
<L>And laugh at all his threats and blusters:</L>
<L>We'll eat up all the hay and corn,</L>
<L>Or, what we cannot eat we'll burn:</L>
<L>Then we'll surround him in such swarms,</L>
<L>That he'll be glad to ground his arms.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As it grows late, and ye seem weary,</L>
<L>(Except to see how votes may carry)</L>
<L>I'll say no more at this first meeting,</L>
<L>But may resume at next night's <HI>sitting.</HI></L>
<L>And now, at length, the vote round passes,</L>
<L>Maintain, or not, the Rights of Asses;</L>
<L>To know the issue all were keen,</L>
<L>The vote was carry'd <HI>nem. con.</HI> Maintain.</L>
