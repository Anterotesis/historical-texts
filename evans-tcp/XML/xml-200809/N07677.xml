<P>THE late Rebellion in the back Inhabitants has been the Occasion of a Number of Pamphlets being wrote and spread in this Colony, some of which I have seen; the first was the <HI>Narrative;</HI> which I'll venture to say is a good Thing. Then comes the <HI>Quaker Un∣mask'd,</HI> a Pamphlet I set no more Store by that, than I do by the Principles of the writer:' In answer to that another was wrote, 'titled the <HI>Presbyterian Look¦ing-Glass,</HI> which sheweth a great deal of ingenuity accompanied with found Reasons for the publick good.</P>
<P>AND I am sorrry the Author made his Period where he did, had he carried his discourse so far as to have cleared that Matter with regard to the <HI>Quakers</HI> assisting the Loyal Citizens to save the Lives of those <HI>Indians</HI> then in the Barracks; I should not put Pen to Paper on the Subject.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH I am not one of that Society myself yet I have a Love for them as I have for all other good People that were so well adorned with Chris¦tian Zeal and Piety towards GOD; to join as one Man in defence of his righteous Law'; which for¦bids the shedding of Innocent Blood.—Because e¦very Person is deemed innocent in the Eye of the Law▪ untill he is proved Guilty.</P>
<P>I shall quote some of the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Law or Laws of GOD, as they stand upon holy Record.— And by the Valitidy of those Laws I presume to try that Act of Cruelty committed on the <HI>Indian</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="009806_0003_0F7A551135AD16C0"/>
at <HI>Lancaster</HI> by some of the back Settlers—the first Law I find given to Man by the great Legislator was to <HI>Noah</HI> soon after he came out of the Ark with his Family.</P>
<P>"WHO so sheddeth Man's blood, by Man his blood shall be shed.—<HI>Genesis.</HI> Chap. 9, 6.—This Law is very explicite and condemns all such who premedi∣tates the Death of his fellow Creature, and executes it Voluntarily in cool blood, for it is not possible to construe it otherwise, as there is a positive Com∣mand with Directions, how a Murderer shall be put to Death,—not in the malignant Nature of fallen Man, at their own Option, no but quite otherwise; if you will read the 25th Chapter of Numbers, you will find that the Goodness of GOD is there displayed in a wonderful Manner, you will see that he has there given the Law in the most ten∣der and extensive Terms. Not only to the true born <HI>Jew,</HI> but to the Stranger and to the Sojourner amongst them I see no Difference: but an equal Priviledge to both—The <HI>Jews</HI> were commanded to build six Cities, three on each Side on the Jordan, which were to be called Cities of Refuge.—Those were to be an Asylum or Place of Safty unto every Per∣son that had slain a Man:—When once fled to those Cities they were not to be punish'd in any Sort until they were brougt to their Tryal before the Judges, which I suppose to be the Sandhackrum so called, which was composed of seventy Men: by which all Matters of Consequence were deter∣mined. And when these Judges were seated in the Hall of Judgment, they could not pass Sentence
<PB N="4" REF="009806_0004_0F7A5511DD33AD70"/>
upon the Evidence of one Person, but at least there must be two Witnesses to take the Life of one Man.
<Q>Who so killeth any Person, the Murderer shall be put to death by the Mouth of a Witness. But one Witness shall not testifie against any one Person to cause him to die.</Q>
—The Law is so par∣ticularly regardful of Strangers, I cannot with Sa∣tisfaction omit the Asserting some more of it.— which hath an inseparable Connection with that blessed Command of our Saviour▪ which is.—
<Q>Do unto all Men as thou would have them do un∣to thee, for that is the whole Law and the Pro∣phets.</Q>
The Law speaking of Strangers in <HI>Exo. Chap.</HI> 22. <HI>vers</HI> 22, sayeth,
<Q>thou shallt neither vex a Stranger nor oppress him:</Q> And conceive to give it the greater Censure on their Minds; the Lord tells them:
<Q>For ye were Strangers in the Land of <HI>Egypt.</HI> And if a Stranger sojourn with thee in your Land, ye shall not vex them. But the Stranger that dwelleth with you, shall be un∣to you as one born amongst you, and thou shalt love him as theyself.</Q>
<HI>Lev.</HI> 19.33. Upon the Whole I must conclude that the Priviledges in the civil Go∣vernment of the jewish Nation was as tender to Strangers, and as regardful of their Happiness as that of the Seed of <HI>Abraham.</HI>—I have coated the Laws, though but a part of those, which promise Protection to Strangers and Sojourners equal to those of our own Nation. Were not Men corrupted by ill Principles in Education, and bidding Defiance to Laws, both Moral and Divine,—I question whether there is any Nation of People in the World at this
<PB N="5" REF="009806_0005_0F7A55125477B730"/>
Time or indeed ever has been: But what has had something of divine Law imprest upon their Minds in such strong Terms, that they have fell upon Measures of some Sort to deter every Per∣son from the executing that horrid Crime; but if perpetrated to punish the Criminal even with Death.—Cain Cryed out my punishment is greater than I can bare,—There was no out∣ward Law to punish him,—What then? An in∣ward Conviction. A wounded Conscience.— He first envied his Brother, and then murdred him the same with <HI>Lameck. Genesis</HI> iv. <HI>vers</HI> 23,
<Q>He said unto his Wives <HI>Adah Zillah,</HI> hear my Voice ye Wives of <HI>Lameck,</HI> harken unto my Speach; for I have slain a Man to my wound∣ing, and a young Man to my Hurt.</Q>
We read no outward Law at that Time, it being (if the Word may be allowed) in the Infancy of Time before the civil Power was so well established as afterwards. The <HI>Apostle Paul</HI> tells us, that there was some of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who had not the Law, were a Law unto themselves,—But why don't every Christian believe it? if he deserves that Name, for my part, I am confident in that Be∣lief: —And I likewise believe, that where the <HI>Apostle</HI> is speaking of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> being endow∣ed with the Spirit of Grace, that they by strictly adhering to that in themselves, walked as order∣ly
<PB N="6" REF="009806_0006_0F7A5512E7434500"/>
as those that had the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI>—obey¦ing of which is a peculiar Advantage to every Man; a Blessing that cannot be taken from him while he himself is zelous for his own Good▪ But if a Man neglects his Duty, and abandons himself to Wickedness, I believe in Time it may cease striving with him: When Men give themselves to lying Evils, and by Degree give way to immoral Acts, they become dark and fenseless to any Good; and are willing to per∣petrate any Crime to serve their Humors, if it be even Murder itself. But those People, al¦though, they have forsaken the Gifts of Grace they cannot fly from a guilty Conscience, they have broken the Law of God, their Punishment is such, that they cannot give themselves Ease▪ neither can they receive it from another, there is a continual Knawing, as though their Bowels were rent in pieces, with Sights of Sorrow, and perpetual Griefs, that cannot be uttered: A woe∣ful Feeling of the Pains of Hell, and no Relief to be had, but by delivering themselves up to Justice, and praying to God for Mercy, desir∣ing that he in his Goodness would admit of that Sacrifice: And make it acceptable to him, <HI>viz.</HI> The Life of the Body as an Attonement for the Sins of the Soul. <HI>For Blood it defileth the Land and the Land cannot be cleansed of the Blood that
<PB N="7" REF="009806_0007_0F7A5513A9952440"/>
is shed therein, but by the Blood of him that shed it:</HI>—Numbers 35, <HI>v.</HI> 33. Here we see how ex∣plicite God is respecting Murder how than is it, or can it be possible that a Christian can here tell of so horrid a Crime as that committed at <HI>Lan∣caster</HI> without the deepest Sorrow mixt with Resentment; how can a solid thinking Man help saying, that had I been there at the Time, when the Banditti came, I could have given my All to have saved the Life of those Indians. <HI>"A Man lay down his Life for his Friend sayeth Christ."</HI> But do call them Indians Innocent, how is it pos∣sible that Indians can it be innocent? I answer, they were innocent, for they had never been convicted by the Laws of God or Man, nor I be∣lieve suspected by their Neighbours. They had a just Right to all the Privileges and Advantages necessary to their Occasions. Why not, they were certainly our Neighbours dwelling on Lands of their own: But if only Sojourners, we live enjoined by the Royal Law, to take necessary Care that they are not Sufferers by us, and that they receive no ill at our Hands, but must love them as ourselves. Here my Bretheren I have produced a Part of those heavenly Statutes, which are binding to us any Part of the Royal Laws; and by the Sanction of these very Laws, I shall prove that the <HI>Quakers</HI> Assisting the good People
<PB N="8" REF="009806_0008_0F7A55146CC0E4D8"/>
of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> or His Honors the Governors Request to preserve the Lives of the <HI>Indians</HI> then in the Barracks, is consistent with Reason, agreea∣ble to our Laws, hath an inseparable Connecti∣on with the Law of God, and not repugnant to the Rules of their Society,. In the first Place, I consider God as the alone Source from whence all Good cometh. It may be said, that he has mani∣fested himself two Ways. The one by his Prophets and holy Men, in former Ages, who received his Law for the establishment, the Happiness and the Tranquillity of Mankind in their several Stations of Life. And in the next Place by his holy Spirit, which convinceth to us. Nay it is a plain and undeniable Truth that we must re∣gulate our Lives and Manners agreeable to the abovesaid Laws, or we cannot be Christians.— No nor we cannot be Heathens, unless be of the most abanded and reprobate Sort, which will cry out with <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Lamach,</HI> I have kill'd my Bro∣ther, I have kill'd my Neighbour, I am hurt, I am wounded, my Torment is greater then I can bear. I assert it to be impossible for a faithful Christian to be out of the Reach of this Law, while he is on this Side of Eternity, it's ingrafted in him in such a manner that he cannot serve God and Family, omits that, which is the most assential part of his Duty in civil Society, <HI>viz.</HI> The Safety
<PB N="9" REF="009806_0009_0F7A5515270C98E8"/>
or Preservation of his Fellow Creatures Life, then I conclude, that the spiritual instinct, which the animal part hath a Sympathy which binds the whole Creature to act for the Safety of his Neighbour as that of himself,—if any Man, denies this at the same Time he denies God—But still the <HI>Quakers</HI> are blam'd,—I ask for what? <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sayeth the <HI>Unmasker,</HI> they have diviated from their Principles:—I ask what their Prin∣ciples are? Surely not to murder their Neigh∣bours in cool Blood:—No sayeth the <HI>Unmasker,</HI> that's not my Meaning,—Then I ask what? they have foresook their Principles,—Here it seemeth as though I should answer for him, and say that when my Brethren were coming down from <HI>Lancaster</HI> under Arms to kill the Indians▪ and endeavoured to send a Report by their Agents, that their Number was seven Times more then they realy were;—Then the <HI>Quakers</HI> join'd with the other <HI>Citizens,</HI> some in getting the Cannon to the <HI>Barraks,</HI> some few I suppose, carried Muskets, and were as active as any others in Helping to keep the Indians from being murder'd:—Alass; is this the chief Basis on which their monstrous Mould Hill is build. why all this is exactly genuine, and agreeable to the best Saints principlels on Earth, those Indians had fled to the City of Refuge they had made
<PB N="10" REF="009806_0010_0F7A5515E4D19538"/>
the Barracks their Asylum, they were to be pro¦tected by the Royal Law,—Then I say that e¦very loyal Subject (present) in the Kingdom of Christ were bligated to lend their Assistance,—But why are the <HI>Quakers</HI> blam'd more than any other Denomination, seeing the Church, Annabaptist and even the Romans join'd as one Man, whose Minister as I have been told, cautioned his Hearers with whatever you do, don't join the Rebells, but if you act, let it be in behalf of the Province, this was true Loyalty.
<Q>Of all Denomination of People that dwelleth upon the Earth, he that feareth God, <HI>i. e.</HI> payeth a just Regard to his Laws, and worketh Right∣eousness, shall be saved.</Q>
I think there is no prudent Man that will say all they have done for it; was no other than in Obedience to the Law of Heaven in building a City of Refuge, to secure their Neighbours from premeditated Murder, be∣cause they have had Experience in the Instance of <HI>Lancaster,</HI> that Walls build with Hands, could be a Place of no Safety, neither do I conceive that any other Measures would have succeeded, but by honestly acting as the royal Law directs.— Hower, this I am sure, there is no one can make it appear inconsistent with the strictest Rules of Justice.—And under the Blessing of Heaven, it answered all the good Purposes desired—Surely
<PB N="11" REF="009806_0011_0F7A5518ACA5A448"/>
there is not one hath Reason to find Fault with a Building, which when erected suits the Builders purpose—But this Building is of a more worthy and elegant Nature—This was built by God <HI>his Laws were the Materials and the loyal Citzens of Philadelphia, were his Workman.</HI>
<Q>blessed is the Man that knoweth his Masters Will and doth it, blessed are you, when men shall revile, and persecute you, and shall say all Manner of Evil against you, falsly for my Sake,</Q>
<HI>Matt.</HI> 1, 11. <HI>Well this is the very Situation my beloved Citizens, that you are in.—This Unmasker has been gathering of filth and flinging at you for some weeks past but for want of skill or steady hand he has be∣spatterd his own Garments, that he realy appears to be a dirty Fellow—Although he seems to point his Shaft at the Quakers: Notwithstand∣ing the prudent Reader will undoubtedly see that the vindictive Spirit stops not, here the Unmasker revealeth the Quakers for acting, because they are Principled against war both offensive and defen∣sive. —Let that be the case,—their Principles still remain untoucht in that particular, for here is no War amongst Men that I know of, but Nation against Nation or the King and Parliament one against the other, which is called a civil War,— shall this be called a War, when a Number of ill minded Men collected into a Body, and threaten Destruction to their Neighbours in the same Pro∣vince,
<PB N="12" REF="009806_0012_0F7A5518F3700B88"/>
I say, shall this be called War, no it is not War; it is an insulting Act of Rioters and no other,—then where is the War on the other Side of the Question, can any Nation or People defend themselves in that of actual defensive war, when there is no Oponent, what a fallacious way of Argument is this, besides, can it be thought mor∣raly possible that any religious Society of People, could supprese such an act of Cruelty in Speculati∣on for they could never think it would be perpe∣trated, is that a sufficient Reason for a Society to establish a Rule, whereby every member, thus acting must be disown'd,—we'll suppose the Case is as follows—why not a Member of that Society must ever use any Endeavours, even to save the Life of a tender Mother or a sucking Infant, least he should be thrown over the Hedge. One of the Prophets speaking in the Name of the Lord, con∣cerning Israels offering their Children to Molac. sayeth, "I never thought of such a thing, neither hath it entered into my Heart." There is no re∣ligious Society in the known World that can make such a Rule to forbid themselves assisting in saving the Lives of their fellow Creatures; let the Num∣ber of the Destroyers be small or great: But there is no such Rule. Then I ask, how it's possible to deviate from or transgress a Rule, which has no Being under Heaven. The Apostle Paul sayeth, "where there is no Law, there is no Transgression."
<PB N="13" REF="009806_0013_0F7A5519AEB09360"/>
I am well assured this Unmasker would have had as much Reason to have blam'd the good People of the City, if they had clapt the Indians in the Workhouse-Yard and secured them there, as to have defended them at the Barracks, the odds is none in fact, the stone Walls would then have been their Asyalum. As in the other the Number of Men with their Preparation, was their City of Refuge, but our Workhouse could have been no more a Place of Safety to them Indians, than Lan∣caster Workhouse to their Brethren; I under∣stand the fundamental of the Quakers Principles, are to be guided and directed in this Life by the Spirit of God: well if so, that holy Spirit that gave the abovementioned Law, was the Spi∣rit of the same God,—then I am sure there is not any thing can or will argue in stronger terms for their tender Principles than their honorable Pro∣cedures in Philadelphia,—for God is the same, his Spirit ehe same, his Rule and Sovereignty the same:—then whatever Men opposes or vili∣feyes their Principles in this Race, must dis∣regard the Law, despise the Spirit that gave it, and bid Defiance to the God of all Flesh. I ask our Unmasker if he is the Man.</HI></P>

People in the Manner he hath the Quakers, but this may be only his Mask, for I think it's evi∣dent by the Scope of his writing, that he hates his King, his Governor and even his Country too, under the present Constitution, as ill as he hates the Quakers:—And if Oppurtunity serv'd his In∣clination would unmask himself, with as much zeal as he has the Quakers, with Bitterness of Mind.: I have never been told by any moderate Man, be of what Society he might, that the Quakers have ever been a troublesome restless People under any Government, although I be∣lieve they have suffered the most of any religious Society now in the World, and that for Con∣science sake only; how zealously steady were they at the Time that <HI> King Charles the First</HI> and <HI>Oliver,</HI> when in the Hight of all the Quarrel;—Did the Quakers ever riot, Mutiny or plot against the Government. No but bore every Revolution with Meekness and Fortitude; in the Times of their Persecutions, when their Meetings were broken up by Officers, themselves thrown into nasty Dungeons, others suffered a Confiscation of their whole Estate, some died in Prison: in short every way afflicted, that Malice could think of, and the chief Instigators of this were Men as like our Unmasker, as a Cock is like a Dunghill Fowle, and after all those Persecutions, Sufferings and Trials, these peaceable People have undergone;

the Unmasker seems to want them to have been Rebels to their God and their King, and sacrifice their most righteous Principles to have pav'd the Way for his Brethren, who intended to offer the Blood of the Indians in the Barracks for a Peace Offering to their great God Presby∣tery, —But thank Fortune he know them better by this Time, and may plainly see that there is more Loy∣alty by nine Degrees in the Quakers, than in himself and all his Adherents, he tells us he has been unmasking the Quakers, if that be so, he has neglected the Beam in his own Eye, while he has been peeping for a Mote in his Neighbours; for I'll venture to say, not only his Mask is put off, he is almost strip't to the Buff. I think there is but one spoted Garment to cover his Body, one pluck more strips him, don't mistake me my Brethe∣ren, it is not my Work or at least, but Part of it.
