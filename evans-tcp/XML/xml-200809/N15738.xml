was concluded and signed by the plenipotentiaries of the said United States, and by the plenipotentiary of his said majesty, duly and respectively authorised for that purpose, at the places of their respective residence, and at the dates ex∣pressed under their several signatures; which said treaty, written both in the American and French languages, is (in the American) in the words following, to wit,</P>

<HEAD>A TREATY of AMITY and COMMERCE between his Ma∣jesty the King of Prussia, and the United States of America.</HEAD>
<P>HIS majesty the king of Prussia, and the United States of America, desiring to fix, in a permanent and equitable manner, the rules to be observed in the intercourse and commerce they desire to establish be∣tween their respective countries, his majesty and the United States have judged that the said end cannot be better obtained than
<PB N="5" REF="020089_0005_0FADEDC7DE218040"/>
by taking the most perfect equality and reciprocity for the basis of their agree∣ment.</P>
<P>With this view his majesty the king of Prussia has nominated and constituted as his plenipotentiary the baron Frederick William de Thulemeier, his privy coun∣sellor of embassy, and envoy extraordinary, with their high mightinesses the States General of the United Netherlands; and the United States have, on their part, given full powers to John Adams, esquire, late one of their ministers plenipotentiary for negociating a peace, heretofore a dele∣gate in Congress from the state of Massa∣chusetts, and chief justice of the same, and now minister plenipotentiary of the United States with his Britannic Majesty; doctor Benjamin Franklin, late minister plenipotentiary at the court of Versailles, and another of their ministers plenipoten∣tiary for negociating a peace; and Thomas Jefferson, heretofore a delegate in Con∣gress from the state of Virginia, and go∣vernor
<PB N="6" REF="020089_0006_0FADEDC89309EAA8"/>
of the said state, and now minister plenipotentiary of the United States at the court of his most Christian Majesty: Which respective plenipotentiaries, after having exchanged their full powers, and on ma∣ture deliberation, have concluded, settled, and signed the following articles.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<P>There shall be a firm, inviolable, and universal peace and sincere friendship be∣tween his majesty the king of Prussia, his heirs, successors, and subjects, on the one part, and the United States of America, and their citizens on the other, without excep∣tions of persons or places.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>ARTICLE II.</HEAD>
<P>The subjects of his majesty the king of Prussia may frequent all the coasts and countries of the United-States of America, and reside and trade there in all sorts of produce, manufactures, and merchandise;
<PB N="7" REF="020089_0007_0FADEDC951F993E8"/>
and shall pay within the said United States no other or greater duties, charges, or fees, whatsoever, than the most fa∣vored nations are or shall be obliged to pay; and they shall enjoy all the rights, privileges, and exemptions, in navigation and commerce, which the most favored nation does or shall enjoy; submitting themselves, nevertheless, to the laws and usages there established, and to which are submitted the citizens of the United States, and the citizens and subjects of the most favored nations.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE III.</HEAD>
<P>In like manner the citizens of the Unit∣ed States of America may frequent all the coasts and countries of his majesty the king of Prussia, and reside and trade there in all sorts of produce, manufactures, and mer∣chandise, and shall pay, in the dominions of his said majesty, no other or greater duties, charges, or fees whatsoever, than the most favored nation is or shall be obliged to

<HEAD>ARTICLE IV.</HEAD>
<P>More especially each party shall have a right to carry their own produce, manu∣factures, and merchandise, in their own or any other vessels, to any parts of the dominions of the other, where it shall be lawful for all the subjects or citizens of that other freely to purchase them; and thence to take the produce, manufactures, and merchandise of the other, which all the said citizens or subjects shall in like manner be free to sell them, paying in both cases such duties, charges, and fees only, as are or shall be paid by the most
<PB N="9" REF="020089_0009_0FADEDCDB00F8EF0"/>
favored nation. Nevertheless the king of Prussia and the United States, and each of them, reserve to themselves the right, where any nation restrains the transportation of merchandise to the vessels of the country of which it is the growth or manufacture, to establish against such nation retaliating re∣gulations; and also the right to prohibit, in their respective countries, the importa∣tion and exportation of all merchandise whatsoever, when reasons of state shall require it. In this case the subjects or citizens of either of the contracting parties shall not import nor export the merchan∣dise prohibited by the other; but if one of the contracting parties permits any other nation to import or export the same mer∣chandise, the citizens or subjects of the other shall immediately enjoy the same liberty.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE VI.</HEAD>
<P>That the vessels of either party loading within the ports or jurisdiction of the other, may not be uselessly harassed or detained, it is agreed that all examinations of goods required by the laws, shall be made before they are laden on board the vessel, and that there shall be no examina∣tion after; nor shall the vessel be searched at any time, unless articles shall have been laden therein clandestinely and illegally, in which case the person by whose order they were carried on board, or who carried them without order, shall be liable to the laws of the land in which he is, but no other person shall be molested, nor shall any other goods, nor the vessel be seized or detained for that cause.</P>

<P>Each party shall endeavour, by all the means in their power, to protect and de∣fend all vessels and other effects belonging to the citizens or subjects of the other, which shall be within the extent of their jurisdiction, by sea or by land; and shall use all their efforts to recover, and cause to be restored to their right owners, their vessels and effects which shall be taken from them within the extent of their said jurisdiction.</P>

<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The vessels of the subjects or citizens of either party, coming on any coast be∣longing to the other, but not willing to enter into port, or being entered into port, and not willing to unload their cargoes or break bulk, shall have liberty to depart, and to pursue their voyage without moles∣tation, and without being obliged to render account of their cargo, or to pay any du∣ties,

<HEAD>ARTICLE IX.</HEAD>
<P>When any vessel of either party shall be wrecked, foundered, or otherwise da∣maged on the coasts, or within the domi∣nion of the other, their respective subjects or citizens shall receive, as well for them∣selves as for their vessels and effects, the same assistance which would be due to the inhabitants of the country where the da∣mage happens, and shall pay the same charges and dues only as the said inhabi∣tants would be subject to pay in a like case; and if the operations of repair shall require
<PB N="13" REF="020089_0013_0FADEDD0D2A34938"/>
that the whole or any part of their cargo be unladed, they shall pay no duties, charges, or fees on the part which they shall relade and carry away.

<HEAD>ARTICLE X.</HEAD>
<P>The citizens or subjects of each party shall have power to dispose of their personal goods within the jurisdiction of the other, by testament, donation, or otherwise; and their representatives, being subjects or citi∣zens of the other party, shall succeed to their said personal goods, whether by testa∣ment or <HI>ab intestato,</HI> and may take posses∣sion thereof, either by themselves or by others acting for them, and dispose of the same at their will, paying such dues only as the inhabitants of the country wherein the said goods are shall be subject to pay in like cases; and in case of the absence of

the representative, such care shall be taken of the said goods, and for so long a time, as would be taken of the goods of a native in like case, until the lawful owner may take measures for receiving them. And if question shall arise among several claimants, to which of them the said goods belong, the same shall be decided finally by the laws and judges of the land wherein the said goods are. And where, on the death of any person holding real estate within the territories of the one party, such real estate would by the laws of the land descend on a citizen or subject of the other, were he not disqualified by alienage, such subject shall be allowed a reasonable time to sell the same, and to withdraw the proceeds without molestation, and exempt from all rights of detraction on the part of the government of the respective states. But this article shall not derogate in any manner from the force of the laws already published or hereafter to be published, by his majesty the king of Prussia, to prevent the emigration of his subjects.</P>

<P>The most perfect freedom of conscience and of worship is granted to the citizens or subjects of either party, within the jurisdiction of the other, without being liable to molestation in that respect, for any cause, other than an insult on the reli∣gion of others. Moreover, when the sub∣jects or citizens of the one party shall die within the jurisdiction of the other, their bodies shall be buried in the usual bury∣ing-grounds, or other decent and suitable places, and shall be protected from viola∣tion or disturbance.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE XII.</HEAD>
<P>If one of the contracting parties should be engaged in war with any other power, the free intercourse and commerce of the subjects or citizens of the party remaining neuter with the belligerent powers shall not be interrupted. On the contrary, in that case as in full peace, the vessels of the
<PB N="16" REF="020089_0016_0FADEDD367A907C8"/>
neutral party may navigate freely to and from the ports, and on the coasts of the belligerent parties, free vessels making free goods, insomuch that all things shall be adjudged free which shall be on board any vessel belonging to the neutral party, although such things belong to an enemy of the other; and the same freedom shall be extended to persons who shall be on board a free vessel, although they should be enemies to the other party, unless they be soldiers in actual service of such enemy.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="13" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE XIII.</HEAD>
<P>And in the same case of one of the con∣tracting parties being engaged in war with any other power, to prevent all the difficul∣ties and misunderstandings that usually arise respecting the merchandise heretofore called contraband, such as arms, ammuni∣tion, and military stores of every kind, no such articles carried in the vessels, or by the subjects or citizens of one of the par∣ties, to the enemies of the other, shall be
<PB N="17" REF="020089_0017_0FADEDD49F16A9F8"/>
deemed contraband, so as to induce con∣fiscation or condemnation, and a loss of property to individuals. Nevertheless it shall be lawful to stop such vessels and ar∣ticles, and to detain them for such length of time, as the captors may think necessary to prevent the inconvenience or damage that might ensue from their proceeding, paying, however, a reasonable compensation for the loss such arrest shall occasion to the pro∣prietors: And it shall further be allowed to use, in the service of the captors, the whole or any part of the military stores so detained, paying the owners the full value of the same, to be ascertained by the cur∣rent price at the place of its destination. But in the case supposed, of a vessel stopped for articles heretofore deemed contraband, if the master of the vessel stopped will de∣liver out the goods supposed to be of con∣traband nature, he shall be admitted to do it, and the vessel shall not in that case be carried into any port, nor further detained, but shall be allowed to proceed on her voyage.</P>

<PB N="18" REF="020089_0018_0FADEDD5556DC760"/>
<HEAD>ARTICLE XIV.</HEAD>
<P>And in the same case where one of the parties is engaged in war with another power, that the vessels of the neutral party may be readily and certainly known, it is agreed, that they shall be provided with sea-letters, or passports, which shall ex∣press the name, the property, and burthen of the vessel, as also the name and dwelling of the master, which passports shall be made out in good and due forms (to be settled by conventions between the parties whenever occasion shall require); shall be renewed as often as the vessel shall return into port; and shall be exhibited when∣soever required, as well in the open sea as in port. But if the said vessel be under convoy of one or more vessels of war be∣longing to the neutral party, the simple declaration of the officer commanding the convoy, that the said vessel belongs to the party of which he is, shall be con∣sidered as establishing the fact, and shall
<PB N="19" REF="020089_0019_0FADEDD69526B7F8"/>
relieve both parties from the trouble of further examination.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE XV.</HEAD>
<P>And to prevent entirely all disorder and violence in such cases, it is stipulated, that when the vessels of the neutral party, sail∣ing without convoy, shall be met by any vessel of war, public or private, of the other party, such vessel of war shall not approach within cannon-shot of the said neutral vessel, nor send more than two or three men in their boat on board the same, to examine her sea-letters or passports. And all persons belonging to any vessel of war, public or private, who shall molest, or injure, in any manner whatever, the people, vessels, or effects of the other party, shall be responsible in their persons and property for damages and interest, suf∣ficient security for which shall be given by all commanders of private armed vessels before they are commissioned.</P>

<P>It is agreed that the subjects or citizens of each of the contracting parties, their vessels and effects, shall not be liable to any embargo or detention on the part of the other, for any military expedition, or other public or private purpose whatsoever. And in all cases of seizure, detention, or arrest, for debts contracted or offences committed by any citizen or subject of the one party, within the jurisdiction of the other, the same shall be made and prose∣cuted by order and authority of law only, and according to the regular course of proceedings usual in such cases.</P>

But no vessel which shall have made prizes on the subjects of his most Christian Majesty the king of France, shall have a right of asylum in the ports or havens of the said United States; and if any such be forced therein by tempest, or dangers of the sea, they shall be obliged to depart as soon as possible, according to the tenor of the treaties existing between his said most Christian Majesty and the said United States.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE XXI.</HEAD>
<P>If the two contracting parties should be engaged in war against a common enemy, the following points shall be observed between them.</P>
<P N="1">1st. If a vessel of one of the parties, re∣taken by a privateer of the other, shall not have been in possession of the enemy
<PB N="24" REF="020089_0024_0FADEDDA77920B30"/>
more than twenty-four hours, she shall be restored to the first owner for one-third of the value of the vessel and cargo; but if she shall have been more than twenty-four hours in possession of the enemy, she shall belong wholly to the recaptor.</P>
<P N="2">2d. If in the same case the recapture were by a public vessel of war of the one party, restitution shall be made to the owner for one thirtieth part of the value of the vessel and cargo, if she shall not have been in the possession of the enemy more than twenty-four hours, and one tenth of the said value where she shall have been longer, which sums shall be distri∣buted in gratuities to the recaptors.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The restitution in the cases afore∣said shall be after due proof of property, and surety given for the part to which the recaptors are entitled.</P>
<P N="4">4th. The vessels of war, public and private, of the two parties, shall be reci∣procally
<PB N="25" REF="020089_0025_0FADEDDB07DB7980"/>
admitted with their prizes into the respective ports of each: but the said prizes shall not be discharged nor sold there, until their legality shall have been decided according to the laws and regula∣tions of the states to which the captor be∣longs, but by the judicatures of the place into which the prize shall have been con∣ducted.</P>
<P N="5">5th. It shall be free to each party to make such regulations as they shall judge necessary for the conduct of their respec∣tive vessels of war, public and private, re∣lative to the vessels which they shall take and carry into the ports of the two parties.</P>

<P>And to prevent the destruction of pri∣soners of war, by sending them into dis∣tant and inclement countries, or by croud∣ing them into close and noxious places, the two contracting parties solemnly pledge themselves to each other, and to the world, that they will not adopt any such practice; that neither will send the prisoners whom they may take from the other into the East-Indies, or any other parts of Asia or Africa, but that they shall be placed in some part of their dominions in Europe or America, in wholesome situ∣ations; that they shall not be confined in dungeons, prison-ships, nor prisons, nor be put into irons, nor bound, nor other∣wise restrained in the use of their limbs; that the officers shall be enlarged on their paroles within convenient districts, and have comfortable quarters, and the com∣mon men be disposed in cantonments, open and extensive enough for air and
<PB N="29" REF="020089_0029_0FADEDDFAEAD1CA8"/>

which commissary shall see the prisoners as often as he pleases, shall be allowed to receive and distribute whatever comforts may be sent to them by their friends, and shall be free to make his reports in open letters to those who employ him; but if any officer shall break his parole, or any other prisoner shall escape from the limits of his cantonment, after they shall have been designated to him, such individual officer, or other prisoner, shall forfeit so much of the benefit of this article as pro∣vides for his enlargement on parole or can∣tonment. And it is declared, that neither the pretence that war dissolves all treaties, nor any other whatever, shall be considered as annulling or suspending this and the next preceding article, but on the con∣trary, that the state of war is precisely that for which they are provided, and during which they are to be as sacredly observed as the most acknowledged articles in the law of nature or nations.</P>
