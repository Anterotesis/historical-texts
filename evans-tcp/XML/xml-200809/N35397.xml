<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>HEARING an <HI>Apostle</HI> say, that he used not the excellencies of speech, nor the enticing words of man's wisdom, when he came preaching the Gospel of <HI>Jesus</HI> amongst the Gentiles: I conclude, that what was <HI>then</HI> useless, is altogether as unnecessary <HI>now.</HI> Truth needs no art, but manifests itself by plainness of speech, in the demonstration of the Spirit, and of Power.</P>
<P>I believe I may say, without unchari∣table censure, that mankind in the gene∣ral, judge according to appearance, and not with righteous judgment; the flowery stile, the swelling word of vanity alluring to the flesh, is that, which, (by reason of the depraved senses) is most pleasing to the ear, and striking to the mind, it be∣ing not important, whether it contains any matter or not: The Truth itself, being seldom that which the reader falls in love with; it is language, founds, and pomp of words, that enamours a flattering world.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="046269_0003_1021159E3ABD0878"/>
To urge, that the allurements and ele∣gance of speech adorns the Truth, and removing the prejudice which many have conceived against it, excites them to read with delight, &amp;c. I say, this plea will be found upon impartial inquiry, to be a flat contradiction of the scriptures, a stale device of Truth's grand enemy: For let the <HI>same subject,</HI> be but treated of in the true apostolic language, viz. plain∣ness of speech; and those raptured ad∣mirers of the sublime, however nervous its argument, will reject it.</P>
<P>To assert that the excellency of speech, and the enticing words of man's wisdom, is necessary to enforce the Truths of the Gospel; is to impeach the judgment of one whose choice did not proceed of necessity, when he chose plainness of speech, such as was familiar to the mean∣est capacity; I mean the apostle to the Gentiles; he looked on the enticements of speech, as a proceeding unworthy the majesty of his matter, yea rather <HI>hurtful</HI> than <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> unto his hearers; left their faith should stand in the wisdom of man, and not in the power of God. Hence I am encouraged to hope, that the absence <PB N="v" REF="046269_0004_102115A325C743C0"/>of those embellishments from my Trea∣tise, (though it proceed of necessity) will neither marr the beauty, nor relax the nerves of Truth contained therein: And, what further conspires to render my ex∣pectations sanguine in this particular, is the persuasion, that there are such in the world, whose ears cannot be charmed with dead unmeaning sounds, and whose hearts are susceptible of Truth, in its artless native dress.</P>
<P>But as the <HI>multitude</HI> think otherwise, and are contrary to <HI>me;</HI> in the grace and love of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> I stand prepared for censure, and reproach, and am not afraid of their utmost enmity: nor is it in the <HI>power</HI> of the world to <HI>torment</HI> me with disappointments, because my ex∣pectations are suited to their candour and clemency.</P>
<P>Through the knowledge of myself, and the observation I have made in life, I understand a little of human nature; and having learned of the Father, am not altogether ignorant of him who is the Truth: I therefore perceive, that <HI>reproach</HI> and the <HI>Gospel</HI> are inseparably <PB N="vi" REF="046269_0005_102115A66D0A2AA8"/>connected; that it is impossible to be∣lieve, and bear witness of the <HI>one,</HI> without being exposed to the virulence of the <HI>other,</HI> therefore God forbid that I should seek to avoid it, but rather meet it re∣joicing, and receive it with open arms; being thereby crucified unto the world, and the world unto me.</P>
<P>As I make no pretension to infallibi∣lity, nay as I pretend not to the abilities of fallible authors: respecting wisdom, and Letters, it will not surprise me, nor need it surprise any <HI>body e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se,</HI> if some busy critic, whose genius leads him ever in search of offal, and garbage, should pre∣tend to detect in my book, not only bad grammar, with inaccuracies in phrase; but errors in judgment also: Nor shall this trouble me, provided he substitute instead thereof, what consists more with the honour and glory of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord, for <HI>then</HI> my aim and end is answered.</P>
<P>If I am asked in <HI>meekness</HI> to explain myself in any particular, wherein it is judged I have not been quite intelligible, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ough I cannot promise success, I find m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lling to attempt it. But, when <PB N="vii" REF="046269_0006_102115A833DBAE38"/>any conceited spirit, from meer <HI>wanton∣ness,</HI> majesterially declares me wrong, I shall not reply; because <HI>the servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>As I do not remember to have read the author, who hath treated of the sub∣ject contained in the following Tract; any farther than to drop some very brief hints of such a Truth, which hath been immediately contradicted by some other position: So neither do I remember to have read any thing wrote in consutation thereof, except a few admirable pieces lately handed about; in some of which, my name stands conspicuous as an He∣retick. I have reasons with me very sufficient, why I take no notice of those important spirits, so as to answer them in form.</P>
<P>First, Respecting such that I have seen, their performances evidence beyond all controversy, that they did not understand the matter which they wrote against, and therefore treated that with contempt which was above them, being not afraid to speak evil of dignities. I would al∣ways, <PB N="viii" REF="046269_0007_102115AB475EB030"/>(unprovoked by their petulancy) answer those with silence, as being beneath my attention. I would harden my ear against the roarings of ignorance, and be utterly insensible of their invectives:</P>
<P>It being ridiculous to fret at the bark∣ings of a Cur, when it is the nature of the animal to be noisy. Moreover, my wife, and powerful Antagonists, are generally positive without candour; yea even <HI>in∣fallible</HI> in their own conceit: With such it is unlawful to reason. To see what important airs those little masters give themselves, strikes one at once with laugh∣ter and contempt; and constrains the <HI>serious</HI> mind to commiserate the abject state of Man, which nothing more fully discovers, than the egregious vanity, and insolence, of absolute determinations with∣out reason. For my part, after having abjured the <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> I can never submit to any infallible chair of an infe∣rior Sort: Therefore their positions have no weight with me, where they produce not their reasons, and such reasons as immediately relate to the matter in hand, and take in its meaning.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="046269_0008_102115AE4EE5EB48"/>
Until then, they may think as high as they please of themselves, (as vain conceit seems necessary to keep up their spirits) I must of necessity respect them, so, as to take no notice of their Anathe∣mas, but boldly confess that after the way which they call Heresy, so worship I the God of my Fathers.</P>
<P>Another reason, why I do not choose to answer (in form) those Antagonists who have as yet appeared in public against me, is, that personal pique, dis∣appointments, self-interest, &amp;c. was not the least powerful motive with them in their opposition; and where those consi∣derations influence the mind, it is an easy matter to find fault, Yea <HI>prejudice</HI> is dex∣terous at <HI>making</HI> faults, where there are none. I would not answer such as these, left, by inflaming them, I should drive them to an utter renunciation of Christi∣anity: Left they should cast off, and re∣ject that measure of Truth which at pre∣sent they <HI>may</HI> have, only because, (from personal enmity) they may be in all things my opposites. For, where a spirit of re∣sentment and self-seeking takes the lead, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not strange to see men change their <PB N="x" REF="046269_0009_102115B27B88EBC8"/>Maxims, lest they should be thought to agree in any particular with the objects of their envy; it is a pity the Evidence that some of my opponents are already too guilty of this Charge, is so full.</P>
<P>Besides, there were many other stimu∣lating considerations, well nigh as pow∣erful as that of personal enmity, and revenge, which made them opponents to me, and my doctrine: such as making their peace with the World, at the expence of the <HI>persons,</HI> and <HI>matter,</HI> trampled on. They were well aware, of its being a very likely method to gain the favour of man∣kind, in the general, especially of the pi∣ous populace; the light, in which things stand at present, administering them a∣bundant opportunity for so doing, it be∣ing shrewdly foreseen, that <HI>prejudice</HI> a∣gainst the person and matter exploded, would not permit the world to inquire impartially, into the merits of the Cause. They could not but be greatly encouraged, being assured of victory, before they came to the trial. It might reasonably be ex∣pected from hence, that their exclama∣tions, and invectives, would have a large run in the world; to the great advantage <PB N="xi" REF="046269_0010_1020EFCD7703FFE8"/>of the Authors: This Thought had a sweet feeling in it. But, I believe, there has been a disappointment here; it should have been considered, that the Person, and Doctrine, which they bespatter, are not sufficiently popular, and formidable, to raise a general Call, for their confutations, and preservatives.—The <HI>deliverance,</HI> is always proportionable to the <HI>Danger,</HI> nor can the <HI>latter</HI> be great, from what is only the object of hatred, and contempt, and not of fear: Had this been consi∣dered, their expectations had not been so sanguine. I might by appealing to <HI>Human nature,</HI> prove that those my reasons, for not taking any farther notice of my An∣tagonists, are not mere <HI>surmise;</HI> which may possibly be false: But I decline this, and declare myself well assured of what I have said, from circumstances sufficient∣ly convincing; however, I bid them all farewel in the words of the Poet,
<Q><L>If Want provoke, or Madness makes them print,</L>
<L>I wage no War with <HI>Bedlam,</HI> nor the <HI>Mint.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>It is not my aim in this Treatise, to defend by external <HI>Argument,</HI> against gainsayers, what I conceive to be the Truth, as it is in <HI>Jesus;</HI> but simply to <PB N="xii" REF="046269_0011_102115B707FF12C8"/>throw such a light upon the matter, that <HI>as</HI> it is true, it might appear in a mea∣sure intelligible also. I was for a long season, after satisfied of the redemption which is in <HI>Christ</HI>; very uneasy at times, concerning the Equity thereof: Indeed the hints which occasioned those dispu∣tings in my Mind, were merely acciden∣tal; for having received much consola∣tion in the first persuasion of redemption, the forgiveness of sins, in the Blood of <HI>Jesus,</HI> I judged myself sufficient, (from the Argument I fancied I was Master of, and that resistless authority, which I dreamt attended my words when I spake of divine things) for the conviction of the most <HI>hardened,</HI> and <HI>averse</HI> to salvation by <HI>Jesus</HI>; and accordingly, as opportu∣nity offered, failed not to exert myself upon this principle: at length I met with one, who (though his zeal, and self-suffi∣ciency, bare no proportion to mine,) was far my superior in understanding: after he had with <HI>coolness</HI> heard what I had to say, he asked me wherein was the justice, and equity, of one Man's suffering Death, yea even the torments of Hell, for ano∣ther: so contrary to reason and also to the testimony of scripture, which often <PB N="xiii" REF="046269_0012_102115BBDF452468"/>declares, that <HI>the Righteous shall not suffer for the Wicked; but that every man's sin should be charged upon his own head,</HI> &amp;c. I was not prepared for such a question as this and was therefore involved in a difficulty, which I could not obviate. I appealed to the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God, it was granted that God was <HI>Sovereign,</HI> and that from his <HI>Sovereign</HI> pleasure, he created us, re∣deemed us, &amp;c. having nothing to move him to it, but his own will: yet he wills nothing but what is just, and equitable, because he is just when he judgeth, and justifieth. I would then have urged, that as God is infinitely above us; his tho'ts, and ways above ours; we are not to con∣ceive of <HI>him,</HI> his <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Equity,</HI> ac∣cording to our low, and scanty notions thereof. It was answered, if I granted that mankind had any true notion of Justice, and Equity, though but in the smallest degree, then what is contrary to <HI>this,</HI> must be much <HI>more so</HI> to God, whose Justice and Truth, is infinite, pure, and eternal. I urged other matters, to as little purpose, and though I considently continued in my former assertion, yet I was forced to abate much of my self∣importance, and very often afterwards, <PB N="xiv" REF="046269_0013_102115BD655E40F0"/>was greatly disturbed in my mind, on account of these things. As far as my capacity would admit, I applied myself to reading; and read a great many Books, treating of redemption by <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>; and found them all run in one Channel, <HI>viz.</HI> that Man being a debtor, and trans∣gressor, and unable to save himself, <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> became his surety, under an engage∣ment to pay his Debts, and to bear his punishment: The <HI>Equity</HI> of which, is generally resolved into the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God, or accounted for, from the willing∣ness of <HI>Christ</HI> (as an <HI>independent Divine Person</HI>) to suffer, in the sinners stead: whilst others satisfy themselves, with the bare positive assertion, that it is equita∣ble, for one person to be surety for ano∣ther, not only in case of Debt; but even in capital offences. Those resolutions, I read, over, and over, but rather more <HI>perplexed</HI> than <HI>satisfied</HI> thereby. In vain it was, that the most pious and orthodox writers, and preachers, explained the matter thus; I was <HI>constrained</HI> to despise all human authority, in things of this nature; especially where there was not the <HI>shadow</HI> of Reason and Fquity. I applied myself more carefully, to the <PB N="xv" REF="046269_0014_102115C0A8FDCE10"/>reading and study of the Scriptures; as without notes, or expositions: submitting in spirit, unto Him, who at first dictated, and hath taken it upon him to make us understand them. And thence it was, I discerned according to that scanty mea∣sure I have attained, what I conceive to be the harmony of divine Truth, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Union</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> and, how clear the equity of redemption by the blood of <HI>Jesus,</HI> appears in this Truth, in the following Treatise I have attempted to thew. And, because I have thereby found a retreat in <HI>Jesus,</HI> from the face of the Enemy, and all his dangerous insinuations, whereby he would have shaken the foundations, I publish it to others, that if there should be amongst my readers, <HI>such</HI> who are tried with trials of like nature, they may possibly have instruction sealed, to their peace, and consolation. It is also probable, that such may read, whom either preju∣dice or lack of opportunity, will not permit to hear.—There are generally but few, amongst the great multitude, who inquire into the merits of the cause they engage in: Tradition, received from their Fathers, zeal and affection for <PB N="xvi" REF="046269_0015_102115C28C63EBB8"/>their Leaders, spirit them on to persua∣sion beyond scruple, that they are in the Truth. It is very probable, there are others, who simply crediting the scripture testimony, that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> died for our sins, and rose again for our Justification, are happy in that Truth; without once inquiring into the equity thereof, or ever thinking it necessary so to do. The re∣ality of their peace, I will not pretend to deny, as they believe the Facts, which the gospel relates, and proposes as the Joy and Peace of Mankind. But yet, the necessity of examining the equity thereof, remains; as is evident, first from the scriptures treating so plentifully of it: To deny the necessity of attending to which teaching, would be the highest arrogance. Again, though they may hitherto have escaped the temptation <HI>within,</HI> and the argument of such <HI>with∣out,</HI> who walk enemies to the Cross of Christ; yet it proves not, that they shall <HI>always</HI> escape: therefore it is ne∣cessary, they should, from the faithful apprehension of their <HI>union</HI> with <HI>Christ,</HI> be so rooted, and grounded in Love, that their Joy may abide, and no man take it from them. Again, it is necessary, that <PB N="xvii" REF="046269_0016_102115C72E2EB548"/>knowing God, they may glorify him <HI>as God,</HI> who, being infinitely glorious, and exalted, in all the perfections of his Na∣ture, hath in this gracious plan, most wonderfully exhibited that Divine har∣mony, which to <HI>man,</HI> is so rich a proof of his unity.</P>
<P>As to my talking so much of <HI>Christ,</HI> his person, and excellencies, my continu∣al endeavour to point <HI>him</HI> out, as <HI>the Way, the Truth, and the Life</HI>; I hope, even such who would be thought the <HI>guardians</HI> of true godliness, will bear with me a lit∣tle, when I give them my reasons for so doing. First, I am under very great obligations to Him, which coming to light every Day, more and more, con∣strains me to speak of him, and to esteem Him very precious. Again, I may be excused a little, because testimonies of this nature, are very rare: whilst <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,</HI> hath them who preach <HI>Him,</HI> every sabbath day, in every synagogue. And whilst most of the publications on Divinity, are now entitled <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>; as the Dady Ad∣vertisements bear witness, (than which, there is <HI>nothing</HI> according to my appre∣hension more fully proves the decline of <PB N="xviii" REF="046269_0017_102115CBEAE4AAC8"/>real Christianity. I hope so insignisicant a person as I, may be indulged with say∣ing somewhat of Jesus Christ. The phrase <HI>Practical,</HI> when applied to Divinity, seems to be made use of, in direct opposition to <HI>Christ</HI>; and that, which <HI>immediately</HI> treats of him: as though <HI>he</HI> was dry Theory, a Fable, or an idle speculation only. Will it be answered, that the wickedness of the age is <HI>such,</HI> as renders it needful to write, and preach, <HI>practically</HI> as called? Is not this giving up the cause to the enemy, and a tacit acknowledgment, that the Article <HI>Christ</HI> is insufficient? Yea, that this Article rather tends to corrupt mankind, and promote bad morals; or indeed to say thus: fain would we reform the world, we have used all means to do them good, we have tried <HI>Christ,</HI> we have preached, and wrote of <HI>him,</HI> but <HI>he</HI> would not do: He only made all things worse, how can <HI>he</HI> be of God, whose Disciples break the Sabbath Day? &amp;c. we are therefore ob∣liged to lay <HI>him</HI> aside, and betake our∣selves to the Law of <HI>Meses,</HI> with other good rules, which pious Men have plan∣ed; and by insisting upon their living up to those (promising <HI>salvation</HI> unto such who <HI>do</HI>; and threatning all that do <HI>not,</HI> <PB N="xix" REF="046269_0018_102115CD71C2AD90"/>with <HI>Eternal Damnation)</HI> we hope to stem the torrent of vice, and turn mankind into the paths of virtue and piety.</P>
<P>Have your inventions answered the End intended; are they more reformed than they were in the days of the Apostles, who made it their business to preach a cruci∣fied <HI>Jesus</HI>? where is the Church, or So∣ciety of Christians <HI>now,</HI> who attain to this Character, <HI>The multitude of them that believed, were of one heart, and of one soul, neither said any of them, that ought of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had all things common?</HI> Acts iv. 32. This was effected by the simple testimo∣ny of <HI>Jesus,</HI> his death, and resurrection; the people were <HI>then</HI> taught, that they were the body of <HI>Christ in particular, and members one of another.</HI> Whereas, the more modern doctrines have taught man∣kind to respect each other as <HI>Aliens,</HI> each esteeming of himself, better than ano∣ther; imagining he has property distinct from his brother, yea even in spirituals; he looks on his <HI>own</HI> things, and not on the things of <HI>another.</HI> Thus the modern doctrines, and traditions of men, are calculated to promote self-love, spiritual <PB N="xx" REF="046269_0019_102116DFE1945040"/>pride, bigotry, and hatred of each other, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tead of love. Therefore is it, that the morals of mankind are as bad as ever, not withstanding the necessity and benefit of holiness, and good works, is daily sounded in their ears. And even amongst the <HI>reformed,</HI> as they would be thought, is there not envying, strife, contention, backbiting, evil-speaking, whispering, uncharitableness, the putting forth of the finger, revenge, inhumanity with every evil work and disposition? and indeed this is the genuine fruit of the doctrines of the age; for where people are taught to distinguish between saints and sinners, and to think themselves holier than their neighbours, it is not strange that they use them ill. As this is so general, I suppose it will not greatly irritate, that a few worth∣less men, without character, or popularity, should make Christ their subject, and be ever <HI>preaching</HI> or <HI>writing</HI> of him. It is to be feared, that being meerly orthodox, in point of works, with a desire at times of <HI>doing,</HI> and at other times, a sigh &amp; sorrow for <HI>not</HI> doing, with a zeal for propagating the doctrine, is that which <HI>sooths</HI> and <HI>keeps</HI> in peace the consciences of many, who otherwise are very sensible of their <PB N="xxi" REF="046269_0020_1020EFE0419CC7E0"/>deficiency in this particular: And to talk of <HI>practice,</HI> and knowing nothing more of it; yea in short, to talk of it, without keeping the <HI>whole Law,</HI> is such a decepti∣on where scripture authority is admitted, yea or even what reason suggests of the nature of the divine Being,) as cannot be accounted for, but by the pride, bewitch∣ery and madness which we are naturally involved in. Persons in this cast, please themselves, like the kings of <HI>Bedlam,</HI> who imagine their rags a purple robe, and their heap of straw a throne; and are very an∣gry with all who will not humour their vain conceit.</P>
<P>As to the zealous promoters of the doctrine of works, in opposition to the complete salvation of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord, we know what <HI>he</HI> says of them: That they lay heavy burdens upon mens shoulders, which they <HI>themselves</HI> will not touch with one of their fingers: and the Apostle says, neither they <HI>themselves</HI> keep the Law, but desire to have <HI>you</HI> circum∣cifed that they may glory in <HI>your</HI> flesh. Thus we are not always to judge of men by their sounds, or to imagine a man greatly pious because he talks of works, or <PB N="xxii" REF="046269_0021_1020EFE1C90F1398"/>writes practical Treatises; nay, it is cer∣tainly reasonable and just for us to with∣hold our credit, and shut our ears, until his <HI>tempers</HI> and <HI>actions</HI> speak: and of <HI>such</HI> I have no need to be afraid, however zealous they may be, for as Mercy, Com∣passion and Charity, are none of the least prevalent in the composition of true Piety, their precious balms can never break my head.</P>
<P>Nothing is more probable than that it will be objected, I am an enemy to good works, or, that convinced by the holy practice of some particulars amongst the Professors of Religion, I pine with envy; affecting to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> what I cannot <HI>attain</HI> unto. To which I answer, I am far from being an enemy to <HI>good</HI> works, that which is truly <HI>Good,</HI> when manifest, always com∣mands my respect: nor can <HI>I</HI> conceive how any man, when convinced of the good, should hate it for <HI>being</HI> so. I do not mean to deny, that the truly Good, is at any time the object of Man's hatred; but then we always suspect that of <HI>evil,</HI> which we allow ourselves to hate; and if from the corruption of nature we hate the Good, because it forbids us the gratifica∣tion <PB N="xxiii" REF="046269_0022_102115D058D7D148"/>of the sensual appetites, yet even <HI>that</HI> hatred doth not totally exclude from the Bosom a secret approbation of the Good. But as weakness and ignorance are (acci∣dentally) properties of human nature, we are not always capable of distinguishing, <HI>perfectly,</HI> between <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil.</HI></P>
<P>I <HI>am</HI> not, cannot, possibly be an enemy to <HI>Good</HI> works; but then, I must have some more incontestable proof of good∣ness, before I become an admirer, than ignorant <HI>roarings,</HI> the clamours and im∣portant airs of vain pretenders. When <HI>I</HI> consider good works, as mentioned in the scriptures, I would distinguish be∣tween them as <HI>spiritually</HI> and <HI>morally</HI> good; the <HI>former,</HI> which merits the di∣vine complacency, mankind are incapable of performing at any time; as I could easily prove was there occasion. The <HI>latter,</HI> which respects <HI>Beneficence</HI> one to∣wards another, as reasonable Beings, as Fellow-creatures, or if you please, from a high<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consideration, as <HI>the Body of Christ in particular, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of another,</HI> is what the Apostle recommends, in that of't cited passage; <HI>That they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> believed in God, may be careful to maintain <PB N="xxiv" REF="046269_0023_102115D42A763188"/>good works; these things are Good, and pro∣fitable unto men,</HI> Tit. iii. 8. And again, verse 14. <HI>Let ours also learn to maintain good works, for necessary uses.</HI> That <HI>Bread</HI> is profitable to the <HI>Hungry, Drink</HI> to the <HI>Thirsty, Clothes</HI> to the <HI>Naked,</HI> and <HI>Honesty</HI> in all your dealings, unto <HI>such</HI> whom you are concerned with; I say, that it is profitable thus mutually to bless each o∣ther, is not to be doubted: profitable to the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and profitable to the <HI>Giver</HI>; as it entitles him to the respect and esteem of his fellow-creatures. Hence may the <HI>Benefits,</HI> and <HI>Benefited,</HI> both be said to profit thereby; and therefore are the works called Good, and said to be profi∣table unto men, yea of necessary use, thus <HI>Thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> man as thou art, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> may prosit the Son of Men,</HI> Job xxxv. 8. But let us not mistake the Apostle's meaning, and imagine them profitable unto us with God, to our salvation and acceptance with <HI>Him</HI>: This would be to renounce the Lord who bought us, to pretend that we have whereof we may boast, even before God; and thus believing a lie, fall into the strong delusion. As a Friend to bene∣volence, equity, and peace among man∣kind, <PB N="xxv" REF="046269_0024_102115D9021850E0"/>I should be glad to see those good works abound; and from a right princi∣ple, would encourage them with all my power. But when men begin to speak of these things, and consider them as <HI>spiritual</HI> Good, as well-pleasing, and ac∣ceptable with God, as Righteousness, Holiness, or fruitfulness before <HI>Him</HI>; or, when making <HI>this</HI> their sanctification, they go about to prove their <HI>Faith</HI> there∣by, inwardly respecting thsoe motions, as <HI>Proofs</HI> and <HI>Marks</HI> of their Grace and Christianity: I fay, when <HI>this</HI> is the cafe, with ardent zeal, ten-fold more burning than they can ever shew for the works of their own hands, we will prove all their righteousness to be filthy Rags, Dross, and Dung: exposing the pride, vain-glory, hypocrisy, covetousness, self-love, &amp;c. of all their Works, Words, and Thoughts, protesting with all our souls, against bringing the <HI>Blind</HI> and <HI>Lame</HI> into the House of the Lord: for as much as we conceive, that the honour of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and the real happiness of mankind, is greatly concerned here. And, if for <HI>this,</HI> I am deemed an enemy unto good works, so be it. I will remember the word of the Lord, who said, <HI>the World cannot hate <PB N="xxvi" REF="046269_0025_102115DA8A474960"/>you, but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil,</HI> John vii. 7. And, as to any conviction received from the most upright amongst men, from their holy example, &amp;c. the God, and Father of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> before whom I stand, knoweth that I lie not, when I declare, That there is but <HI>one</HI> Man,

But, wher∣ever I have spoken slightly of <HI>Human</HI> Goodness, it is because I am convinced it is not good; but a false shew, and lying vanity; and therefore as a <HI>falshood,</HI> always to be opposed. Another reason, is, because these vain pretensions gaining ground amongst mankind, tends greatly to the dishonour of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and his Gospel; and to make void the Grace of God. Again, it tends to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> the Soul, who is convinced of the weakness of Human Nature, according to the scrip∣tures; and to keep him from the rest, that remaineth for the people of God: nor can any rejoice in it, but the <HI>deceived,</HI> who know not themselves, nor the scrip∣tures, nor the Power of God.</P>
<P>Again, it encourages to party: its warmest Advocates, being of the num∣ber of those who <HI>separate themselves.</HI> And yet, nothing more fully establishes that exploded Maxim, <HI>Let us do evil, that good may come.</HI> It is <HI>this</HI> which <HI>allows</HI>; <PB N="xxviii" REF="046269_0027_102115E2362659B8"/>yea even <HI>authorizes,</HI> one Man, to think himself holier than <HI>another,</HI> and conse∣quently to say in his Heart, <HI>stand by, come not near me, I am holier than thou.</HI> From hence, instead of <HI>loving</HI> his Brother, He takes an occasion to <HI>Judge</HI> Him, <HI>despise</HI> and <HI>hate</HI> him: yea, from this very principle, proceeds all the animosity, pride, backbitings, whisperings, conten∣tions, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> which abound amongst all the various sects of religious people: Yea, such is their zeal, for the <HI>Good</HI> as considered in the creature, that (least they should turn from it) they will not scruple to break <HI>any,</HI> yea <HI>every</HI> command∣ment, in the Book of God; and to run a Tilt, against the <HI>whole</HI> of the perfect ex∣ample, which the holy <HI>Jesus</HI> hath exhi∣bited; only to keep their votaries steady to their favoured plan. And, lest you should think my assertion <HI>too</HI> strong, you need only for your conviction, put your Head into some of those places, where <HI>Human <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> or <HI>inward holiness,</HI> or, <HI>that</HI> work of the <HI>Spirit upon the Heart,</HI> which opposes the free salvation of man∣kind by the Blood of <HI>Jesus,</HI> is the <HI>chief,</HI> or <HI>continual</HI> subject: for though the <HI>term,</HI> are different, the <HI>Matter</HI> is the same: I <PB N="xxix" REF="046269_0028_102115E56AE892C8"/>say, put but your head into any of those places, and you will <HI>hear</HI> and be convin∣ced <HI>soon,</HI> if you are impartial, of the truth whereof I affirm. You, may <HI>there</HI> hear a person in defence of <HI>inward holiness,</HI> (and as he <HI>pretends,</HI> with a pure zeal to promote the same,) raving, with all the energy and eloquence of Pride, censori∣ousness, slander, cruelty and ignorance; against, <HI>such,</HI> whose Names are not in <HI>His</HI> Legend, bespattering them with the epithets of <HI>Dogs, Swine, Devils, Hereticks,</HI> &amp;c. threatening them with eternal des∣truction, warning the people against them, as the <HI>pest</HI> and <HI>plag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> of the earth; withal, giving such descriptions of them, that their Disciples knowing them, may learn to <HI>hate them,</HI> and copy their pastors examples, in speaking all manner of evil of them. This is not only Satan rebuk∣ing <HI>sin,</HI> but Satan propagating <HI>holiness</HI> also, a <HI>doing evil, that good may come.</HI> But, if it should be objected, that our Saviour and the Apostles used these epi∣thets, when speaking of unbelievers, I answer, When they used them, it was (by shewing mankind what they natural∣ly were) to enhance the Grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they were saved: and were commonly <PB N="xxx" REF="046269_0029_102115E6F15D7F38"/>given to <HI>such</HI> who trusted in themselves; that they were righteous, despised others. Besides, our Saviour and his Apostles, had <HI>power,</HI> when they applied those characters to any individual, to demonstrate by un∣deniable signs, the truth of what they spake: and that they were not revilers. As for instance, when <HI>Saul,</HI> who is called <HI>Paul,</HI> set his eyes upon <HI>Elymas</HI> the sorce∣rer, and called him a Child of the Devil, an Enemy to all Righteousness, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> he <HI>proved</HI> the truth of what he said by striking him blind. God, thus bearing witness unto his accusation. As with <HI>Peter</HI> also, in the case of <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Saphira.</HI> But, where any, who would be thought infallible <HI>now,</HI> are for ever filling their mouths with the Apostolick cen∣sures, and anathemas, without being able to shew the like proof of their infallibi∣lity; they are to be respected as proud, arrogant, conceited; and rather railing, reviling accusers of their Brethren, than Apostles of <HI>Christ:</HI> yea; as the offerers of strange fire before the Lord, and not the fire, which fell from God upon the Altar, when <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> blessed the people. How ridiculous must it be! to <HI>read</HI> or <HI>hear,</HI> a Man writing, or preach∣ing <PB N="xxxi" REF="046269_0030_102115EA56D4CD88"/>up holiness; which is the Love of God and his neighbour; in <HI>such</HI> a spirit, and terms, as, (rendering the di∣vine Being so implacable, and difficult of access, and his neighbours so much worse than himself) hath certainly a more powerful tendency to promote en∣mity, hatred, and contempt, than Love. Thus men <HI>preach</HI> and <HI>write</HI> of goodness, until <HI>Love</HI> entirely ceaseth. And of <HI>Faith,</HI> until it dwindle as <HI>small</HI> as a grain of mustard seed; until all hope, and charity, for their Neighbours, is wholly lost. <HI>Nothing</HI> is more common, than for men to preach, and dispute, for ho∣liness; yea for its being in <HI>themselves,</HI> until quarrelling with the opponent, there appear nothing in them, but the most <HI>unholy</HI> tempers and dispositions. And yet, they must be thought <HI>holy,</HI> and that in themselves though our every sense tes∣tify the contrary. Sure man is scarcely a reasonable creature, to be thus imposed upon, or what is worse; He is a most <HI>be∣witched</HI> and <HI>infatuated</HI> creature. O! Thou great Archetype of true holiness, <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>: thou <HI>only</HI> art holy, thou <HI>only</HI> art the Lord: and thou knowest, where∣fore I thus speak. It is because mankind <PB N="xxxii" REF="046269_0031_102115ED96C51618"/>would <HI>rob</HI> thee, by assuming what be∣longs unto <HI>thee</HI> only, it is because the principle of self is such that they would found Dominion in Grace; from a sup∣position of superior holiness, use their fellow-creatures ill.</P>
<P>I have <HI>thus</HI> spoken, thou knowest; because I apprehended what I have spo∣ken <HI>against,</HI> to be utterly false; a grand deception, and yet the Idol of mankind, Thou art <HI>my</HI> standard, and everlasting pattern of true Goodness; and I always conclude that whose gathereth not with Thee, scattereth: nor can I ever believe <HI>that</HI> to be <HI>holy</HI> or <HI>good</HI> which is contrary to thee: unto thy Grace, and Keeping I commit my all; and that thou shouldest Bless what I have written, unto the Glory and Praise of thy venerable Name: and respecting my readers, unto their con∣viction, even to that Eternal Life, which is in thee; I Pray.</P>
<P>It may easily be seen, that I aim only at illustrating that Grand Capital Propo∣sition of the Saviour's: <HI>I am the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>To do which, I am not afraid to tread the most unfrequented Path, and walk therein undisturbed, notwithstanding the clamorous accusations; of Sin gularity, <PB N="xxxiii" REF="046269_0032_102115F262FA9AE8"/>Novelty, and Heresy. <HI>Affectation</HI> of be∣ing singular, from selfish Views, I hold abominable: and as an <HI>equal</HI> Abomina∣tion, the attempt to shun the Cross, when standing in the Path of Truth.</P>
<P>Respecting the <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>scope</HI> of the following Treatise, I am above uncer∣tainty therein: Nor can the <HI>piddling Pedant</HI> who feeds on garbage, the de∣tection of Errors in Grammar, the obso∣leteness and impropriety of Words; exclaiming at want of Literature in Au∣thors: Neither the Orthodox <HI>Precise,</HI> who sits in the infallible Chair, and con∣demns as Heresy, whatsoever squares not with his Dogma; supported by <HI>Creeds,</HI> Confessions of Faith, and the positive determinations of the most <HI>sound</HI> and <HI>pious</HI> expositors: I say, neither the <HI>one</HI> nor the <HI>other,</HI> will be able to shake my confidence respecting the <HI>Truth</HI> I aim at illustrating: which is, that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord, is ascended far above all Hea∣vens, that He might fill all things, and that in the <HI>new Man</HI> there is <HI>neither Greek, nor Jew, circumcision, nor uncircum∣cision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond, nor free, but Christ is all, and in all.</HI> As to my Defects as an <HI>Author,</HI> I hope, I have <PB N="xxxiv" REF="046269_0033_102115F5A37AFA30"/>by confessing my insufficiency, and re∣nouncing all pretensions to any such Abi∣lities, <HI>Anticipated</HI> my Examiners in their Censures: but if Time should shew the contrary, I have an infallible remedy in Silence, as there is nothing appears to me, worth contending about, besides the <HI>Faith once delivered to the Saints</HI> which contention is <HI>spiritual,</HI> and manifest through the whole of the Christian life; against all <HI>without</HI> and <HI>within</HI> that would pervert, and draw the mind from <HI>Christ:</HI> And consists not in vain Jangling, per∣verse Disputings, and Contentions with each other, to the subverting of the mind; as many have vainly imagined: Feeding, and pleasing themselves, with the fond conceit of eminence in faith, and know∣ledge; because they were better versed in argument than their opponents, or could run them down, by the meer dint of positiveness, and much speaking.</P>
<P>The <HI>latter</HI> I would always shun, as con∣trary to <HI>Christ:</HI> but in the <HI>former I</HI> would be found, hurting no man, but earnestly contending for the Faith: unto the edi∣fication of <HI>all</HI> whose Servant I am, for <HI>Christ's</HI> Sake.</P>

<HEAD>UNION: OR, A TREATISE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE doctrine of <HI>Union</HI> between <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Church</HI> renders the System of man's redemption by his Blood, beautifully consistent, and worthy its glorious Author.</P>
<P>It explains the harmony of the divine perfections, and reveals God, acting ac∣cording to the principles of his nature, in the salvation of mankind by <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord.</P>
<P>Hence, it appears greatly worthy of our consideration; and in treating there∣of, I would observe the following method:
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Attempt the proof of <HI>Union</HI> as ne∣cessary to the equity of Salvation by <HI>Jesus.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Explain, as far as I may, the nature thereof.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Hint its Antiquity, and unchange∣able Duration.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="2" REF="046269_0035_102115FA6F0C1910"/>
IV. Point out a few of the never-fail∣ing Springs of Consolation, arising therefrom.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>Union</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and his <HI>Church,</HI> appears to me a Truth of such impor∣tance, that I can see no consistency in the Doctrine of Salvation by <HI>Jesus</HI> without it.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The method of grace and salvation accor∣ding to Union: is not at all contradictory to the sovereignty of God: That being sufficient∣ly manifest, where he hath decreed the honour, and glory of his Son, as the principal and lead∣ing maxim in all his divine appointments. <HI>He was before all things, and by Him all things consist.</HI> The creation of Man, and his being appointed to obtain salvation, by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> is a farther proof of divine sovereignty; nothing moving the Almighty thereunto, but his own will: Yet this hinders not the <HI>Method</HI> and <HI>Execution</HI> of this Grace, its being according to equity, and <HI>that such</HI> as We, by <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Revelation</HI> may properly conceive of. But when sove∣reignty is introduced from first, to last; to the utter exclusion of equity, which is often done; (as a palliative for man's ignorance in divine things) the consequences attending are dan∣gerous. First, as it depreciates the sacrisice of <HI>Christ</HI> and makes his Death unnecessary: since <HI>Absoluteness</HI> might have remitted the offence without shedding of blood. Or if it is hinted, that this Condition <HI>took place</HI> and was <HI>accepted</HI> from meer sovereign pleasure only: Then, of consequence it was not proportionable, as an attonement unto the offence; and its Dignity as the Blood of God denied: Nor (upon such a supposition) was it necessary that our Saviour should be more than man. But, if the scrip∣tures dignify the Blood of <HI>Jesus,</HI> in saying, that God purchased the Church <HI>with his own Blood</HI>; if <HI>he</HI> was made a curse for us: if <HI>his</HI> sufferings as the punishment of sin was equal to the of∣fence; then was it accepted, not from <HI>meer ab∣soluteness,</HI> but from the harmony and full consent of Mercy and Truth, Righteousness and Peace. Again, such an use made of Divine Sovereignty, would be to reject the testimony of <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets; where they declare that God will not hold the sinner guiltless, nor acquit him without the shedding of Blood, even the Blood of the offender. To throw a light upon which, and to instruct the people in the mystery there∣of, they were taught from the Union subsisting between themselves, and their sacrifices, to res∣pect the Blood, and death, of their sacrifice, as their own: and as such, was the Blood taken by the High priest into the holy presence; where the names of the people ingraven on the stones o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> memorial, were present with the blood; confessing it, and claiming the benefits resulting from the shedding thereof, as a pun∣ishment adequate to their sin. Which blessings were remission and justification to Life. Thus through all the dispensations committed to <HI>Moses,</HI> the symbols of equity are inseperably connected with the Figures of Salvation by <HI>Jesus.</HI> From all which it appears, That God's sove∣reign Grace, and Will to save mankind, hath been executed according to strictest Truth and Equity: and such is the Wisdom, that God is unspeakably glorious in the Honor, and Glory his <HI>Son</HI> hath obtained thereby; and mankind infinitely advantaged. Should it be objected, that the Apostle himself resolves certain que∣ries in the sovereignty of God; saying, <HI>who art thou that repliest against God? shall the thing formed, say unto him who forme. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, why hast thou made me thus?</HI> &amp;c. I answer, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was not speaking here of Salvation and the method thereof, but of the people; some of whom, as respecting the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the Truth, were taken whilst others were left. The wherefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> believe, and others do not, is not the object of Faith, no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> within my line to thew; and should I be inquisitive, the Answer is re∣corded; <HI>What is that to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> such inquiries being more curious than pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble, our Saviour will give no other answers it being not necessary to our peace and happiness. And as God has not thought sit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> himself in that particular, we are constrain to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, to resolve it into his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, tho' it is not to be doubted, but the Time will come, when the equity of this and all his ways with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will clearly appear. <HI>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> all that I have done</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 23.</NOTE> <PB N="3" REF="046269_0036_102115FEAD3CC7B0"/>My present design, is to render, with as much plainness of Speech as possible, the <PB N="4" REF="046269_0037_1021160035FB2EF0"/>reasons of my Ideas; intending thereby, to prove at once, the necessity and utility of this Grace.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="046269_0038_1021160381A2B768"/>
1. I apprehend it necessary to the har∣mony of the Divine Perfections. For as all the hopes and expectations of the Crea∣ture from the Creator, are founded upon the supposition of his goodness; Men of every sentiment will agree to this proposi∣tion, God is Good.</P>
<P>And that we may rightly conceive of him under this character, it is as necessa∣ry we should see him <HI>Justice, Holiness</HI> and <HI>Truth;</HI> as <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Love:</HI> since all those properties must unite, and act in perfect Harmony, to constitute real good∣ness. Thus considering the Almighty, we are verily persuaded, that as a God infinite in Goodness, He <HI>doth</HI> not, <HI>will</HI> not, act from one Attribute to the disho∣nour of another. Nor may we expect any exhibition of <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> but in a way of <HI>Justice, Purity,</HI> and <HI>Truth.</HI> There∣fore it doth not appear how God from a principle of mercy and peace towards mankind, could punish sin upon <HI>Christ,</HI> without the concurrence of Rightcous∣ness and Truth; nor can this concurrence or harmony be proved, without <HI>Union</HI> between <HI>Christ,</HI> and those for whom he endured the <HI>Cross,</HI> and <HI>despised the shame,</HI></P>

<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Isai. iii. 10, 11.</NOTE> This is the Language of <HI>Truth:</HI> one jot, or tittle of which, shall not fail; though Heaven and Earth should pass away: Therefore such an <HI>Union,</HI> or relation, between <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Church,</HI> as gives <HI>Him</HI> the right of redemp∣tion, and brings <HI>Him</HI> under that Charac∣ter <PB N="7" REF="046269_0040_1021160B861DBC20"/>which is obnoxious to punishment; is absolutely necessary: that His sufferings for sin, might accord with the declara∣tions, and demands of truth.</P>
<P>2dly. It is contrary to <HI>Justice</HI> to af∣flict the Innocent: to punish and destroy him, is cruelty and injustice. Without the consideration of <HI>Union,</HI> where is the Justice of charging the black rebellion, and crying guilt of <HI>Man</HI> upon the pure and spotless Head of <HI>Jesus</HI>? but God doth nothing unworthy of himself, or contrary to the Harmony of his Nature. To say that the undertaking on <HI>Christ's</HI> part was voluntary, neither proves nor implies, his right to suffer: because it is not his <HI>willingness,</HI> but the approbation of <HI>divine Justice,</HI> which proves His right to taste the Death of the Cross. And, as the nature and property of Justice, is always its own rule of acting; it cannot admit of the Innocent's being punished, nor of the Transgressor's being acquitted: For God the righteous Judge, hath pronoun∣ced a <HI>woe unto such who su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fy the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah v. 23.</NOTE> I am aware of an objection here, from such who <PB N="8" REF="046269_0041_1021160D0EEFF1B0"/>would establish imputation, without re∣lation, or <HI>union,</HI> viz. that the Law admits of one Man's being surety, or bondsman for another; and can justly oblige him to fulfil his engagements: To this I answer, It is most absurd to make human Laws a standard for God's method of dealing with mankind; except it be first proved that those Laws are fully conformable to the Law of God; in Justice and Equity: Until this be proved, what Man decrees, or what the Law of Nations is, hath no weight at all when brought to teach the way of God with Man. Besides, I know not of any human Laws, which admit of suretyship in <HI>capital</HI> Offences; and Sin is not only a <HI>Debt,</HI> for which suretyship is sometimes admitted, but a <HI>Transgression,</HI> a <HI>Crime,</HI> capital in the highest sense, only attoned for by the shedding of Blood; by the <HI>Death,</HI> yea, by the <HI>eternal Death</HI> of the Sinner: which Justice must inflict, before it can be properly satisfied; nor can it possibly admit of a Surety here: because, it can only punish Him, whom it <HI>first</HI> finds guilty; and that not by rec∣koning him to <HI>be</HI> what he is <HI>not,</HI> ac∣cording to human quibbles; but accord∣ing to artless, reasonable, divine Equity; <PB N="9" REF="046269_0042_1021161063028258"/>which can only declare such guilty, on whom the fault is found, and can only find the fault on such who have commit∣ted it; <HI>We</HI> only committed the fault, upon <HI>Us</HI> only can it be found: There∣fore, without such an <HI>Union</HI> between <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>us,</HI> as exposes <HI>us</HI> in <HI>his</HI> person, to Judgment and Condemnation; the harmony of the divine perfections, doth not appear in the things which he suffer∣ed, because contrary to Truth and Justice.</P>
<P>Again, it is contrary to <HI>Mercy,</HI> as Mer∣cy may not, consistent with it own nature, trespass the limits of Truth and Justice. But, if <HI>Jesus</HI> suffered for sin, without such an Union to the Sinner, as made his Sufferings and Blood, to be regarded as that of the offender; though there be an appearance of mercy towards <HI>us,</HI> there is great lack of it towards <HI>Him,</HI> who suf∣fered for sin unjustly charged upon him, Such is not the nature of infinite Good∣ness, to shew mercy to <HI>one,</HI> through in∣justice to <HI>another:</HI> But, if united to the Sinner, there is a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> yea, a <HI>Divine Equity,</HI> in His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and mercy ap∣pears to <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> where God hath provi∣ded himself a Lamb for the Burnt-offer∣ing <PB N="10" REF="046269_0043_102116136596C1C8"/>the like appears to <HI>Christ,</HI> where God hath engaged to support him, under his Just sufferings, to hold his Hand, and to keep him, when He gave him a puri∣fier to the people. <HI>This</HI> is Mercy, tem∣pered with Justice, and in the faithful view of <HI>this</HI> every Believer can sing of Mercy and Judgment.</P>
<P>Again, it is contrary to <HI>Wisdom;</HI> yet God hath marked out all his ways in in∣finite Wisdom: But that System which is not founded in equity, hath no exhibi∣tion of true wisdom in it; nay rather ac∣cuses God (if imputed to Him) either as lacking wisdom when concerting His plan, or else, of <HI>unwillingness</HI> to give us a specimen thereof; and consequently of denying his own Praise, and Man's hap∣piness; which consists in admiring, and glorifying Him, in the discoveries of His infinite wisdom. For, where is the wisdom of imputing Sin to Christ, which he had no right to bear? and whence his right, if not from Union to the sin∣ner? but grant <HI>this,</HI> Then indeed the great Deep breaks open, and Wisdom, infinite Wisdom appears: whilst each beholder, with wonder cries, O! the <PB N="11" REF="046269_0044_102116180F815470"/>Depth! who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His Coun∣sellor?</P>
<P>It is also contrary to <HI>Love:</HI> the scrip∣tures are very explicit, in declaring the Father's Love to the Son; but the pu∣nishment of this Son, for crimes he stood in no relation to, implies a defect in Love: yea, rather a greater Love to <HI>Man,</HI> the offender, than to his well-beloved <HI>Son,</HI> who was the <HI>Brightness of his glory, and the express Image of his person:</HI> and is withal a manifest contradiction to the divine Testmony, which asserts the pre∣eminence of <HI>Jesus</HI> in all things. Withal, to love the impure, is inconsistent with the morality of the divine nature; there∣fore, where the Father giving his son, is at any time mentioned as an evidence of his Love to mankind, it is a proof of his superlative Love unto Him,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son,</HI> &amp;c. The superlative love of God to his Son, is manifest here: where the valua∣bleness of the Gift so infinitely preferable to the receiver, is, in order to enhance the Grace intelligibly hinted. God's giving his <HI>Son,</HI> and giving himself, is a Synonymy in Scripture; and confirms the above proposition: The Les∣ser being always blessed of the Greater. Only considering, that all things were made <HI>for him</HI> and that <HI>he is the appointed Heir of all things,</HI> it will appear in brightness, that the Honour, and Glory, of the beloved Son; and of the Father in him, was first, and principal in view, when he was given for the life of the World: conse∣quently, God's love to the World, was subor∣dinate unto that where with he loved his Son: and all his Grace and Kindness to the World, subservient unto his Glory.</NOTE> and a mani∣festation <PB N="12" REF="046269_0045_10211619988BF750"/>of his glory; the descent of his humbled Life, and bloody Death, being the appointed Depth, from which he was to ascend above all Heavens, that He might fill all things: and, that he might thus inherit the boundless, infinite Riches of His Father's Love, it was necessary he should suffer what He did: and, that the extendings of the Love of <HI>God,</HI> to <HI>Man,</HI> might be <HI>subordinate</HI> unto the Love he bears to the eternal Son of his Bosom, His <HI>union</HI> to those, for whom he suffered the Death of the Cross appears absolutely necessary.</P>
<P>The <HI>union</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and his <HI>Church,</HI> is a necessary consideration; for the right explication of the scriptures; without <PB N="13" REF="046269_0046_1021161C9154A928"/>which, they would want a key, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great part of them be altogether unintel∣ligible, and without any just propriety in phrase. To prove which, I need only note a few of the numerous passages, which are pregnant with this matter. And here I design not the least intimation, of my quoting all the scriptures which posi∣tively speak of this truth; nor will I af∣firm, that those mentioned, are of the whole, the most pertinent to the purpose, but having their light, and perfection, in <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord; and being (as I con∣ceive,) such that treat of <HI>His union</HI> with the <HI>Church,</HI> I oft make use of them, as a confirmation of my Doctrine, when dis∣coursing on this subject: Therefore, oc∣curring the more readily to my memory, I mention <HI>them</HI> in particular, as

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 14.</NOTE> I would therefore consider wherein this di∣vine grace was shadowed forth in <HI>Adam: Moses</HI> tells us that when God created <HI>Man,</HI> Male and Female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name <HI>Adam,</HI> in the Day when they were creat∣ed.

<P>Again, the Apostle treats of this glo∣rious Grace of <HI>Union,</HI> under the Figure of the oneness and harmony of many members in one Body. <HI>For as the Body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one Body being many, are one Body, so also is Christ.</HI>

Again, the increase and nourishment of the Body, is by <HI>Union</HI> with the Head, <HI>from which all the Body by Joints and Bands having nourishment ministered and knit to∣gether increaseth with the increase of God.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 19.</NOTE> The <HI>Head</HI> first receives the food, relishes and prepares it for the whole Body: So also is <HI>Christ</HI>; as the <HI>head</HI> he first receiv∣ed the Grace, it being given us in Him before the world began: as the <HI>head</HI> he tasted for us, not Death only, which he tasted for every man; but Life and Im∣mortality, which he entered into, and re∣lished in our name, and nature, as the <HI>head</HI> for the Body.

As the <HI>head,</HI> though the most exalted and comely part, is yet a member of the Body; it hath a right to suffer for the other mem∣bers, the chastisement of their peace: So also is <HI>Christ,</HI> when they smote the Judge of Israel upon the Cheek with a Rod, it was the iniquity of his heels which com∣passed <PB N="49" REF="046269_0082_1021168A6575C478"/>him about: the chastisement of <HI>their</HI> peace, which he bare, and their ini∣quities which were laid upon him.

The <HI>Union</HI> and harmony of the Body, renders it equi∣table to punish, and chastise the whole Body, in one Member, for its offence in another: because, if <HI>one member suffer, all the members suffer with it.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xii. 25.</NOTE> As the <HI>Union</HI> of the body makes it equitable to punish the <HI>head</HI> for the offence of the other mem∣bers; with like equity doth the members participate with the <HI>head,</HI> in all its honors and glory.

According to the laws of <HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Harmony,</HI> the whole Body may be considered in each member, but with greater propriety, in the more ex∣alted, pre-eminent Member the <HI>Head.</HI> Accordingly, the Scriptures are very ex∣plicit on this point, and speak very much of our being in <HI>Christ,</HI> chosen in him, justified in him, fanctified in him, saved in him, and blessed with all spiritual blessings in him.

Those words of the Apostle, are a quo∣tation from
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. ii. 23, 24.</NOTE>: where <HI>Adam,</HI> on the first sight of his <HI>Eve,</HI> declares the <HI>Union</HI> sub∣sisting between them. It is evident from his words, that this relation did not con∣sist in that matrimonial connection, which commenced, when by mutual consent, and covenant, they cohabited and posses∣sed each other: But was dependant on something prior to this. The source of their <HI>Union,</HI> and kindred relation, was their being <HI>one</HI> in the Love of the Father; where they were undistinguished in sex, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> there being neither Male nor Fe∣male, in <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> in whom they were loved, and chosen, before the world be∣gan. And yet the man was not without the woman, nor the woman without the man in the Lord: This source, had its first opening in their concreation, in one Body, and Human intelligence: which Body, and intelligence, was Male; though not without including the Female: But the Latter, according to the distinction of Sex and personal existence, was, as being in the Male in a state of passivity, and the Male, the active consciousness of the twain in one. <HI>Adam</HI> considering his <PB N="58" REF="046269_0091_102116A670370098"/>perfection in knowledge, could not be ignorant of this, his true state; and there∣fore expecting the Woman, to be distin∣guished in person and sex, as a manifesta∣tion to his senses, of the truth of her Be∣ing, and <HI>Union</HI> unto him; he knew her when the Lord God brought her unto him: And though there was a deep sleep upon him, when she was built from his side, yet when he saw her, he said, <HI>she was flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone;</HI> alluding unto the <HI>former</HI> truth, and not unto any thing which was to follow. For they were not made more one flesh, by that mutual, matrimonial embrace which followed, than they were before: The latter, as a fruit or consequence, being only declara∣tive of the original truth, always apparent to God, and in itself, with him, perfect, and permanent.</P>
<P>Thus the matrimonial bond of <HI>Union,</HI> was with them a <HI>consequence,</HI> and <HI>fruit</HI> of an antecedent <HI>Union</HI> and kindred. This also is more manifest, where <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he was old, caused his servant to swear by the Lord God of heaven and earth, that he would not take a wife to his Son of the Daughters of the Land: <PB N="59" REF="046269_0092_102116A82E6B54D0"/>But that he would take him a wife of his kindred: Such also was <HI>Isaac</HI>'s injunc∣tion to <HI>Jacob.</HI> In this particular also, <HI>Esau</HI> offended; by marrying the daugh∣ters of <HI>Heth,</HI> where there was no <HI>Union</HI> or kindred previous to the Marriage. From all which, it appears that <HI>Adam</HI>'s speech to <HI>Eve,</HI> was grounded upon that kindred <HI>Union</HI> which subsisted between them be∣fore their Marriage.</P>
<P>When the Apostle had said, that a Man and his Wife should be one flesh; he immediately adds, <HI>This is a great Mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and his Church.</HI> From whence we may observe, that the <HI>Union</HI> of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve,</HI> of which I have already spoken, was truly a figure of <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Church:</HI> And again, that this figure, though close and pertinent, is but a figure; an imperfect representa∣tion of the matter, which made the Apos∣tle turn from the fleshly marriage, and say it is a great mystery; and pointing to the Union of Christ and the People, as the grand truth or thing signified, say, <HI>but I speak concerning Christ and the Church.</HI> The Union and kindred relation of Adam and Eve, and of the Patriarchs and <PB N="60" REF="046269_0093_102116ACB05E6688"/>their Wives, previous to their marriage (the latter being subsequent to the for∣mer, and a positive proof thereof). ac∣cording to the primitive Law: The earthly things being a pattern of the hea∣venly, represents the <HI>oneness of Christ</HI> and the <HI>Church.</HI> Their marriage as a figure, shews our believing or closing with Christ by Faith: And that <HI>Union</HI> and kindred, which subsisted between them before Marriage, was a shadow of the <HI>Union</HI> between Christ and his Church, before the Church is brought to the knowledge of her Husband; by believing, or ere they are married unto him who is risen from the dead: But, as marriage is the consummate end of <HI>Union,</HI> it is to be considered as explanatory of the bles∣sings contained therein; it shews the <HI>Woman</HI> under her <HI>Husband's</HI> name, in a joint possession; and enjoyment with him, of his state and condition. As one flesh they cannot be insensible of each other's state, but must naturally feel pain, ease, hunger, thirst, joy, sorrow, happiness, and unhappiness; cannot possibly hate each other, because no man hateth his own flesh. As one flesh they have but one in∣terest, one aim, and end, are not twain <PB N="61" REF="046269_0094_102116AF79575628"/>in any condition, but constantly one in all things. If this idea of marriage is true, it is easily perceived that it is only true in Christ. Previous to our marriage by Faith with him who is risen from the dead, there is a discovery made of his person, of his being our kinsman redeemer, of his right to demand us: hence it ap∣pears wrong to refuse him, nor are we under the <HI>compulsion</HI> of that divine right which he hath to us, only; but he also shews us his glory, his personal beauties, his suitableness to our wants, and this he doth, until our <HI>Reason</HI> is convinced, our objections silenced, and the full consent of all our powers gained, to be his; to bear his name, to commit ourselves fully to him, with all our concerns; until we cease from care, contented and rejoiced that he should cloath us, feed us, instruct us, protect, nourish, guide and preserve us unto everlasting life. The conscience judging of Christ (thus revealing himself) that he is pure, accepted of God and lovely, discerning withal the right of appropriation (from <HI>Union</HI> and relation unto him) joins itself in affinity unto him: yea, puts him on, wrapping itself in him; and thus standing in his state and <PB N="62" REF="046269_0095_102116B10C1A6B50"/>condition, it is purged from all guilti∣ness; and retaining no consciousness of evil, it is holily bold towards God, having <HI>the answer of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ</HI>

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">** Isaiah liv. 9, 10.</NOTE> Thus mar∣riage, consisting of love, and <HI>Union</HI> as the first; the espousal, or contract as the se∣cond; the consummation, with all the at∣tendant Blessings to the Bride, with glo∣ry and honour to the Bridegroom, as the the third; represents the <HI>Union</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> and the <HI>Church</HI>: The first, answering as similar to that antient kindred <HI>Union</HI> sub∣sisting between them, wherein he always <PB N="64" REF="046269_0097_102116B8666B20F8"/>loved her; the second, being a figure of his being made flesh, where he betrothed us unto himself; and the third, of the knowledge, and enjoyment, we have of our lovely Bridegroom by Faith; when believing, we rejoice with joy unspeak∣able, and full of glory. When we enter into the joy of our Lord, according to the conscience; his whole state, yea all the blessings of his birth, life, death, resurrec∣tion, and ascention, is apprehended, claimed, and possessed, by us as our own proper inheritance. I might yet go on attempting to explain the nature of this <HI>Union,</HI> the scriptures being very full of it: But as what I have already said, may pro∣bably be as much to the purpose, as any future hint, should I say much more; and intending at first setting out, to study bre∣vity as much as possible: I shall leave what I have written on the nature of <HI>U∣nion,</HI> unto the reader's consideration; and hasten to treat of its Antiquity, un∣changeableness, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> according to my first proposals.</P>
<P><HI>Union</HI> between <HI>Christ</HI> and the <HI>Church,</HI> is a matter universally acknowledged; where that deference, which is justly due <PB N="65" REF="046269_0098_102116B9ED2D8D40"/>to the scriptures, is paid; though, it is a subject very rarely treated of: Which si∣lence concerning it, implies, either a ge∣neral ignorance of the nature thereof, or, that it is respected as a matter, neither conducive to the glory of God; nor the happiness of mankind; and therefore not necessary to be taught. And where the nature thereof is in some measure known amongst men, and the utility of the doc∣trine allowed, they are much divided about its antiquity; before our believ∣ing, or Faith in Christ, say some: Whilst others with as much strenuousness assert the contrary. But, if what I have already offered to the consideration of the public, shall be allowed to have any weight, or argumentative force; it will appear, that our <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ</HI> is not only antece∣dent to our Faith, and believing, but also to all that <HI>he</HI> did, and suffered, for us men and for our salvation. The matter pro∣posed in the gospel to be believed is true: And relates to the Person of Christ, and his benefits. That he was the Son of God, the Christ, the true <HI>Messiah,</HI> the <HI>I am,</HI> is a matter proposed to be believed, upon the credit of the divine testimony: Because this is a truth, therefore it is to <PB N="66" REF="046269_0099_102116BB8E076E40"/>be believed, and as it is a truth before believing; it is evident that it is not made a truth by believing; but is in itself a truth, perfect, and permanent, whether believed or not.</P>
<P>So also with relation unto his Benefits, that the Father is well pleased in the be∣loved Son, is a truth; to be believed: And not to be made a truth, by believing. <HI>I have blotted out as a thick cloud thy trans∣gressions, and as a Cloud thy sins, turn unto me, for I have redeemed thee.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. xliv. 22.</NOTE> This po∣sitive testimony of Redemption, and the forgiveness of sins, is declared unto them who believed not; upon the credit of which truth, they are called upon to re∣turn unto their God. <HI>Cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniqui∣ty is pardoned.</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. xl. 2.</NOTE> This was a truth concern∣ing those who knew it not, and was to be declared unto them as such, that they be∣lieving it, might be comforted. That he hath <HI>put away sin by the sacrifice of himself, was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our Justification,</HI> is true; and therefore recorded to be credited, and rejoiced in. And, if it appear that the gospel is true before our believing, then <PB N="67" REF="046269_0100_102116C0B26E1C48"/><HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ</HI> before <HI>faith</HI> is true: The latter being necessary to the truth of the former; as I have sufficiently shewn under the first proposition in this Trea∣tise: Where the <HI>necessity</HI> of Union with Him, not only as previous unto our faith in him, but also unto his suffering for our Sins, I think appears pretty obvious. That God loved mankind before Jesus died for them, the scriptures affirm: Where they make the latter, a fruit of the former; and if God loved them be∣fore, he certainly saw them in a sinless state; for it is contrary to the holiness of his nature, to love the <HI>unclean,</HI> being of purer Eyes than to behold iniquity: But in themselves, as related unto the earthy <HI>Adam,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were unclean: Therefore he must have beheld them in Christ, loved them in <HI>him:</HI> which if true, then were they on <HI>him:</HI> And, as being in him in this sense, doth not suppose their knowledge of his Person, through the belief of the Gospel, but a passivity with respect to them; as Branches hidden in the stock, or the Wo∣man in the Man; it implies the closest U∣nion, and the necessity thereof (before their believing) to render and preserve them Ob∣jects worthy of the divide love and favour.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="046269_0101_102116C3B0904040"/>
<HI>Jesus</HI> in his appeal unto the Father, says, <HI>thou hast loved them, as thou hast lov∣ed me.</HI> And again; <HI>thou lovedst me be∣fore the foundation of the world.</HI> In those words, the love of the Father unto the Son, is represented as the grand archetype of his love unto the people: The Father loved the Son before the foundation of the world; but saith the Son, thou hast loved <HI>them,</HI> as thou hast loved <HI>me.</HI> The Father loved the Son, as the brightness of his glory, and his own express Image <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> But saith the Son, thou hast loved <HI>them,</HI> as thou hast loved <HI>me.</HI> The Father loved the Son, and prefered him before Angels, having not said unto any of them, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee: But saith the Son, of the children of men, thou hast loved <HI>them</HI> as thou hast loved <HI>me.</HI> The Father loves the Son, with everlasting, unchangeable delight and pleasure: But saith the Son, thou hast loved <HI>them</HI> as thou hast loved <HI>me.</HI> The Father loveth the Son, and hath revealed it unto him, yea hath given him the knowledge of it above measure: But, saith the Son, <HI>that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.</HI> From all which it <PB N="69" REF="046269_0102_102116C6B97C1468"/>appears, that <HI>Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Church,</HI> are one object of the Father's love; of his choice, good-will, delight, and pleasure. <HI>He</HI> the Head, and <HI>they</HI> the Body, consti∣tuting the elect precious, the Man belov∣ed of God and accepted. But the Head being the <HI>Medium,</HI> between God, and the Body, hath the pre-eminence in all things. And, as the Head was never without the Body, nor the Body without the Head in the Lord, the Body hath always been by <HI>Union</HI> with the Head, intitled unto all the blessings, honours, and glories thereof. Nor doth the Head withhold from the Body, that glory, and honour, which he immediately receives from God, but di∣vinely sheds it over the whole man; ac∣cording unto that <HI>washing of regenera∣tion, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour.</HI> Therefore saith the Head, <HI>the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvii. 22.</NOTE> But to be brief, what hath already been urged to prove the necessity of <HI>Union,</HI> proves it to be also before faith; it being necessary unto the <PB N="70" REF="046269_0103_102116CB68D39960"/>Father's loving <HI>us,</HI> as he loved his <HI>Son,</HI> yea unto his choice of us in his Son; ne∣cessary unto the engagements of Christ on man's behalf; otherwise he had not the right of redemption: Necessary unto his suffering the Death of the Cross for us, as hath been largely shewn in the former part of this work. It is also necessary unto our believing a truth, except it ap∣pear that our faith, or believing, makes it a truth. Indeed the Apostle says, <HI>through faith we understand the worlds were framed by the word of God,</HI> but he doth not say that Faith made the worlds. So truly through Faith we understand our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with <HI>Christ</HI>; yet it is not our Faith that makes it.</P>
<P>But if it is not true until our believing, and by means thereof; then doth believ∣ing make that a truth, which was not a truth, and saith creates its own object, and then embraces it. This looks like the heathen Idolatry, first making their gods and then traiting in them. Or, like Milton's adventurous flight of Satan, through Chaos into the new world; which he performed before the bride was made. That this is contrary to the Scriptures is <PB N="71" REF="046269_0104_102116CED3196780"/>EVIDENT FROM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I John v. 10, 11.</NOTE> <HI>He that believeth not God hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the record that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</HI> The truth here proposed to be believed is this, that God hath given to us eternal life in his Son; and that this is a truth before it is believed, is evident; other∣wise it doth not appear, how our unbelief makes God a liar. Besides, to deny this truth, is to depreciate the sacrifice of Jesus; and to make it an insufficient atonement for sin; without faith and compliance on our part: Thereby ma∣king the glory of Christ, and the truth of the promises made unto him, wholly de∣pendent on the will and actions of the creature. And how fully this frustrates the grace of God, I leave unto every man who knows himself, to determine. More∣over, I take it, that where the all-suffi∣ciency of the sacrifice of Jesus to put away sin, and that without any act of ours, either mental or external, is denied; it amounts to what the Scriptures call a crucifying of the Son of God afresh, and putting him to open shame. But to <PB N="72" REF="046269_0105_102116D1D55A6E40"/>acknowledge the all-sufficiency of the sacrifice of <HI>Christ</HI> to put away sin, with∣out any act of ours; and yet to deny this a truth until believed, (viz. that he hath put away sin by the sacrifice of him∣self) is a palpable contradiction; a po∣sition founded in prejudice and obstinacy, without the least shadow of reason: other∣wise we are to consider such a confession, as containing an equivocation; and when they confess the sacrifice of <HI>Christ</HI> as hav∣ing put away Sin, they make it synonimous with the Sorrow, Hatred, Fear, Faith, Love, Joy, &amp;c. which they feel in their own bosoms: Thereby making no ac∣count of the person and personal suffer∣ings of <HI>Christ,</HI> they embrace a phantasm. Of this spake the Saviour, when he said false <HI>Christs</HI> should arise and deceive many. And indeed, our modern profession of Christianity, seems to be taking large strides towards this deception; where passion, humour and pride is opposed unto the Lord that bought us. Or, will there yet be some way found out, to re∣concile its being a truth <HI>before</HI> believing, with its becoming a truth <HI>by</HI> believing? A position of this sort might suit the sub∣tilties of <HI>Scotue</HI> and <HI>Aquinas,</HI> but the Defi∣nition <PB N="73" REF="046269_0106_102116D35D2424E0"/>thereof, would be too laboured, artificial and sophistical, for Honesty and common Sense. The Gospel is plain, simple and unartificial, suited to the mean∣est capacity; and would be more univer∣sally known, was it not for that unreasona∣ble Estimate which men set on themselves, on account of their learning, wisdom, ex∣perience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thence judging themselves qualified to direct the consciences of their fellow-creatures, they will not suffer them to think for themselves; nor commend them to <HI>Jesus,</HI> and the word of his Grace; but always amusing them with an artifi∣cial religion, consisting of directions how to attain to Faith, to Sanctification, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and yet to consent that they can do no∣thing, but that the agency of the spirit is free as the wind: With resolving cases of conscience, and thereby appropriating the authority of Lawgivers withal giving such definitions of saving faith, true ho∣liness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as none but schoolmen can understand: Thereby puzzling the minds of people, pussing up the vain and opini∣onated with pride and arrogance, from a supposition of their being possessed of those excellencies; and distracting the minds of the more phlegmatick and me∣lancholly, <PB N="74" REF="046269_0107_102116D666FFB420"/>through the fear of their <HI>not</HI> being possessed of them. But should mankind be released from those chains, and suffered to think for themselves, how natural would it be for them to conclude when God proposes a matter in his word to be believed, that that matter is true before they have believed it. Therefore, if it is true, that <HI>Jesus</HI> was delivered for our offences, and raised again for our justification, and that before our faith, that which was necessary unto this trans∣action, namely our <HI>Union</HI> with him, is true also before faith. If it is not our faith or believing that makes this <HI>Union,</HI> then it is an act of eternal love, the <HI>pur∣pose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began;</HI> the antiqui∣ty of which is obvious, nor may its date be fixed, because exceeding the limits of time. And what hath been from ever∣lasting will be unto everlasting, the eter∣nal sameness of the person of <HI>Jesus,</HI> being an undeniable proof of the unchangeable∣ness of this <HI>Union. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, to day and forever.</HI> Who says unto the Church, <HI>Because I live, you shall live also,</HI> for <HI>ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God: I am He who was <PB N="75" REF="046269_0108_102116DB320E3968"/>dead, but am alive and lives forevermore.</HI> It is easy to see, that if our <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ</HI> was dependent on our faith, or be∣lieving it would be changeable; except it appear that we are perfect and unchange∣able in the faith. And if by being perfect and unchangeable in the faith we under∣stand a believing the whole with a full un∣derstanding of the Mystery, of what God hath spoken by the mouth of his Prophets and Apostles, and that constantly, and with∣out the least shadow of wavering; it will appear pretty plain, unto such who know themselves; that mankind are very far from being infallible, and perfect in the faith. And if any would pretend unto his perfec∣tion, (as the pride of Man dare do any thing) whilst the things yet appear in them which shew the least distrust, and doubt∣fulness of God's providence and grace; we must be excused when we declare without fear, that they deceive themselves and the truth is not in them. If the <HI>U∣nion</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> and the <HI>Church,</HI> is depen∣dant on <HI>her</HI> faith, and knowledge of him, then is it proportioned unto her faith, and admits of degrees, it is also sub∣ject to change, yea may possibly be dissolved; as it is not impossible ac∣cording <PB N="76" REF="046269_0109_102116DE58C504C8"/>to the Scriptures, for a person once believing, to turn from the faith. But saith the Apostle, <HI>I am persuaded that nei∣ther Death nor Life, nor Angels, nor Prin∣cipalities, nor Powers, nor Things present nor Things to come, nor Height nor Depth, nor any other Creature shall be able to se∣parate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 38, 39.</NOTE> And, as the A∣postle here doth not intend an impossibility of Believers departing from the Faith, or falling from grace; (having elsewhere proved this possible) he of necessity points out something, which remains a truth, should they cease to believe: And such a truth as their unbelief cannot make void or of none effect: And that is the love of God; always embracing them in Christ Jesus, from which, the Loss of their light and confidence, can never separate them; the Seal of their Foundation being God's knowledge of <HI>them</HI> and not their know∣ledge of <HI>him.</HI> From all which it appears that the <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ,</HI> and his <HI>Church</HI> hath been of <HI>old,</HI> before <HI>Faith,</HI> before <HI>Time</HI>: And remains to be indissolv∣able, and unchangeable.</P>

I would now consider the objections ge∣nerally made unto the Grace of <HI>Union</HI>; and endeavour to give them satisfactory answers.</P>
<P>The old trite objection, of its tending unto Licentiousness, leads the way, saying if <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ</HI> is the ground of our acceptance with God, and our security in his favour; then the doctrine of re∣wards and punishments, is overthrown; and man hath nothing left to stimulate him to virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> To work from an expectation of being rewarded, is to make it of Debt; and not of Grace: But the nature of the Deity is so infinitely pure; so holy, just, and true his Laws; that it is impossible Man should make him his Debtor: Nay it would be the highest arrogance to pre∣tend it: The <HI>scrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> are against it when they protest that no flesh shall glo∣ry in his presence; common <HI>experience</HI> in its sober moments is against it: For that teacheth us, that every man living, is infi∣nitely short of conformity unto the di∣vine nature; therefore the notion of obe∣dience from an expectation of reward, is <PB N="78" REF="046269_0111_102116E37754CF68"/>a tacit acknowledgment of Man's utter ignorance, both of himself, and his God. And then, to suppose that the fear of pu∣nishment is <HI>necessary</HI> to excite Man to obedience, is to reverse the scriptures. The Gospel is preached for the obedience of Faith; that, being thereby delivered from fear, we might serve him in holi∣ness, and righteousness, all the days of our life.</P>
<P>But the obedience of fear, is diametri∣cally opposite unto the obedience of faith: The former, hath its rise and mainte∣nance from a <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>: From that habit, and principle, which makes God a <HI>Liar;</HI> by not believing the record which he hath given of his Son. But the latter springs from a belief of the <HI>Truth,</HI> from a full per∣suasion of the love of God, and of his be∣ing reconciled in <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI> the for∣mer, is a doing evil, that good may come; for where the fear of punishment is judged necessary to obedience, unbelief is established, and authority given to cru∣cify the Son of God afresh, and to put him to open shame, to trample his Blood underfoot, and count it an unholy thing; for all this is tacitly taught, in the fear of <PB N="79" REF="046269_0112_102116E756F06020"/>punishment as necessary unto obedience; and yet this manifest antichristian policy, is generally taught by those conscience directors, who seek <HI>themselves,</HI> and not <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> the Lord: They very well know, that ignorance, unbelief, and fear, are the nerves of implicit obedience, unto their doctrines and traditions. But, that such an obedience, is far from being com∣pensate, for the despight done thereby to the spirit of Grace, and dishonour to the crucified One, they shall sooner or later know; when all their works shall be burnt up, and they shall suffer loss. But the obedience of faith is genuine, free from artifice, without fear, dependant on the perfect amity of God; yea, consists in a constant persuasion <HI>of,</HI> and rejoicing <HI>in</HI> this truth; that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> the Son of God, died upon a cross, and rose again from the dead, having thereby justified us, from every charge once brought a∣gainst us; and sanctisied us from all our pollutions: To submit unto <HI>this,</HI> to have the conscience purified thro' the view and belief of <HI>this,</HI> yea to have every thought brought in captivity unto <HI>this,</HI> is the true obedience of faith. And, this is so far from being urged by fear, that fear <PB N="80" REF="046269_0113_102116EA80E61A40"/>would <HI>annihiliate</HI> it. And so far from having an eye to the reward, that it an∣swers unto that Charity, which seeketh not its own; but says, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee; or thirsty, and gave thee drink, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> Therefore, that the Grace of <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ,</HI> and salvation in him, overturneth the Doctrine of re∣wards, and punishments, as that which influenceth our Lives, is a truth: But then, it only overturns what the scriptures explode; and what <HI>Reason</HI> confesseth mean, and selfish, and not that generous disinterested service of Love, which it de∣clares worthy of the Divine Being, and becoming the dignity of Man.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But, doth not the scriptures rather establish the Doctrine of rewards, and punishments, as that which excites to choose the Good, and refuse the Evil? Is not this their express language, <HI>say ye to the Righteous that it shall be well with him, for they shall eat the fruit of their do∣ings, woe unto the wicked, it shall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands shall be given him.</HI>

<HI>Answ.</HI> Unto the right understanding of the scriptures, it is necessary to know, that they consist of two parts, <HI>Letter</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> or <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Gospel</HI>; now the <HI>Let∣ter,</HI> (or the <HI>Law</HI>) killeth, saith the Apostle but the <HI>Spirit</HI> (or the <HI>Gospel</HI>) giveth life. And as this is needful to be known, so is it also, that we should be able to distin∣guish one from the other; else how doth it appear that we rightly divide the word of life? If the Gospel be consider∣ed, as God's good sayings, or glad Ty∣dings to mankind, we need only consider briefly the state and condition of Man; and then, what may with any propriety, be called glad Tydings, unto one thus cir∣cumstanced, will easily appear. Man is a fallen creature, who breaking the Law of his God, incurred the penalty of eter∣nal death: And, is so far from having ability to extricate himself, that all the imaginations, and thoughts of his heart, are continually evil; without wisdom, without strength, there being none righ∣teous, no, not one; all being shut up, and concluded under sin, they have neither power to <HI>will,</HI> nor to <HI>do</HI>; Now, what can be called glad Tydings unto a Creature in this condition? surely nothing short of <PB N="82" REF="046269_0115_102116F1FAFB55B0"/>that which tells him all is given: And that freely, without condition on <HI>his</HI> part because he can perform none; without <HI>Money,</HI> and without <HI>Price,</HI> because he hath nought wherewith to purchase; and that the Grace, which rediesseth all his griev∣ances, and replemshed him with all good, is given him in <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> who hath brought this life, and immortality to light by the Gospel; by his Birth, Life, Suf∣ferings, Death, and Resurrection; con∣firming all <HI>his</HI> blessing, and Glory, unto his <HI>Church,</HI> by the Grace of <HI>Union:</HI> This appears to be the gospel of glad Tydings, and is a Doctrine with which the scrip∣tures abound.</P>
<P>The Law, is considered as the very op∣posite of <HI>this;</HI> consisting of commands, to fulfil its precepts on pain of damnation, of threatnings, and curses, against all who offend it, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in one point; and never makes any promises of happiness unto mankind, but upon condition of perfect obedience; which is always implied, (tho' not expressed) in every requisite, yea even the most minute, intithing to the inheritance of the promise. The Doctrine of rewards and punishments, is <PB N="83" REF="046269_0116_102116F3C78C1930"/>indeed contained in the Law; but then, it rewards none but such who fulfil every jot, and tittle thereof: And curseth every one, who continueth not to do <HI>all</HI> that is written in the Book thereof.</P>
<P>The <HI>Gospel</HI> gives us all, without requir∣ing ought of us. But the <HI>Law,</HI> giving us nothing, requires all of us. And thus dis∣tinguishing them in the scriptures, we ap∣peal from the <HI>Law,</HI> unto the <HI>Gospel:</HI> Our Authority for so doing, is founded on what follows; whatsoever the Law saith, it saith unto them that are under it: But <HI>Jesus</HI> was made of a woman, made under the Law, therefore the Law speaks unto <HI>him;</HI> and commands <HI>him</HI> to perfect obedience. But, the Law can only curse the sinner: God sent <HI>his Son in the like∣ness of sinful flesh, he was made sin for us, Christ hath delivered us from the Curse of the law, being made a curse for us:</HI> The equity of which proceeding, appears from the <HI>Union</HI> subsisting between <HI>Christ</HI> and the <HI>Church</HI>; of which I have sufficiently spoken. And thus, considering the whole Law fulfilled in <HI>Jesus,</HI> its <HI>precepts</HI> obeyed, its <HI>penalties</HI> endured, <HI>he</HI> now in∣herits the promise: And apprehending <PB N="84" REF="046269_0117_102116F84915F168"/>ourselves in <HI>him,</HI> united unto <HI>him,</HI> thro' all his <HI>doings,</HI> and <HI>sufferings, his</HI> condition, and state is <HI>ours.</HI> And thus standing in <HI>him,</HI> we can indeed read the Law, or the Doctrine of rewards, and Punishments, without fear: Because the punishment, yea, all the threatenings in the book of God, have been executed upon <HI>us</HI> (as sin∣ners and Law-breakers) in <HI>him.</HI> Hence is it we dare not read the demands of the Law unto <HI>ourselves,</HI> as distinct, or sepa∣rate from the view of our <HI>Union,</HI> and <HI>one∣ness</HI> with <HI>him:</HI> Because we cannot answer them; it being only designed as a minis∣tration of Death, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lay us to <HI>ourselves,</HI> and to make us dependant on <HI>him.</HI> Nor, dare we read, any one threatening in the scriptures against the sinner, and ungod∣ly, unto <HI>ourselves,</HI> out of <HI>him</HI>; because we cannot endure it. And, to imagine from any worthiness in ourselves, that we come not under those Characters, which the wrath of God is revealed from Hea∣ven against; and which, are so dreadful∣ly threatened in the word; is, to be most wretchedly ignorant of the spirituality of God's Law; and consequently, of the condition of human nature: For, where the holiness of the Law is known; it will <PB N="85" REF="046269_0118_102116FB4B827110"/>appear, that there is not one obnoxious character in the Scriptures, which (ac∣cording to the purity of the Law) doth not belong to all mankind: Nor can the most <HI>upright</HI> amongst Men, in Justice de∣ny, its belonging unto them: Therefore, our exemption from such characters, and from the punishment due unto them, is only by <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ</HI>; where <HI>his</HI> cha∣racter, is upon <HI>us</HI> before the Father. And, according to the consciousness we have of our salvation state, standing here; we are free from the fear of <HI>present</HI> or <HI>fu∣ture</HI> punishment: Having seen the <HI>end</HI> of it in <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> and therefore are no longer to be influenced thereby. And as the promised reward, the promises were made unto <HI>Abraham,</HI> and to his Seed; which seed according to the Apostle) is Christ; it is also to be observed, that <HI>previous</HI> unto inheriting the promise, there must be a fulfilling of the Law; to make it appear that the promises of God are not against the Law. Where the promises in general speak unto Man, it is unto him, as willing, obedient, repe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, fearing the Lord, believing, &amp;c. every which cha∣racterism amounts unto what the Law demands of Man, <HI>viz.</HI> Satisfaction for its <PB N="86" REF="046269_0119_102117F7A105B470"/>dishonour received by sin that is past, and perfect obedience unto his precepts for the future. And although those re∣quisites are not expresly mentioned in every promise, they are nevertheless im∣plied, otherwise the promises of God would be against the Law, which God for∣bids. Now, if the promise only rewards the Man whom the Law approves of, as Holy, Just, and True, it is easy to per∣ceive that <HI>Jesus only</HI> is the Man: <HI>For all the promises of God, in him, are Yea, and in him Amen.</HI>

<P><HI>Object.</HI> Doth not your description of the person unto whom the promises be∣long, make Salvation conditional, by as∣serting that the promise rewards none, but such whom the Law approves of? This contradicts the Apostle's doctrine, <HI>By grace ye are saved.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> That God is sovereign I grant, but that he saves Mankind from meer so∣vereignty, or arbitrary Grace, without having respect unto his Law, as a trans∣cript of his own perfections, I think I ought to deny: Because he hath pledged his faithfulness and truth, unto his Law, that the transgressor should be punished; and that it should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rather than made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, by the faith of the Gospel: Whereas the Law would be against such promises, as hath no respect unto its Jus∣tice and Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty.

Again, to suppose that mankind are saved by any new Law, consisting of repentance, faith, and new obedience, substituting sincerity in the stead of perfection; I say, to sup∣pose this, would be to make God change∣able: first, giving a Law as a rule of righteousness, and a standard, whereby to know good and evil: And, in process of time giving another, upon easier terms; which could not be, without a change in his perfections: His Nature and Perfec∣tions being the original of every Law, given by him to Mankind. But I would not multiply words, to confute what hath not the least shadow of reason or founda∣tion in the scriptures: For Jesus says, <PB N="89" REF="046269_0122_102116FD24E78280"/><HI>Think not that I am come to destroy the Law, or the Prophets.

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke xvi. 17.</NOTE> It is evident, that our Saviour means by <HI>this</HI> Law <HI>that</HI> which was given upon Sinai: nor did he give any new commandment, which was not included in that Law, as appears from his testimony elsewhere. But, when I assert that the promises are only fulfilled on such whom the Law ap∣proves of, and that <HI>Jesus only</HI> was the Man thus approved of God; I consider him, under the capacity of the second <HI>Adam,</HI> including the <HI>People</HI> in himself; who, by <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>him,</HI> inherit the blessing. And though they can upon this consider∣ation, claim the forgivness of Sin, as an act of Justice in God; yet are they saved by Grace: Their Election in <HI>Christ,</HI> their <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>him,</HI> their eternal life, with all the blessings thereof, was God's pur∣pose and Grace, given them in <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> before the world began; according <PB N="90" REF="046269_0123_10211700950DEC50"/>to which grace they are saved.

<P><HI>Object.</HI> The doctrine of <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ,</HI> (before faith) and of salvation in <HI>him,</HI> tends to make faith, or believing void: because, if I am united unto <HI>Christ,</HI> justified, forgiven, and accepted in him before I believe, where is the necessity of believing at all?</P>

I would only ask, is it from the belief of our <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ,</HI> and salvation in him; or from the disbelief thereof; that occasion is taken to live in unbelief, and believing counted unnecessary? Not from the latter according to the objection, be∣cause, to disbelieve a falshood, is negative orthodoxy: And to say it is from the for∣mer, is the most palpable contradiction; because whosoever believeth <HI>that</HI> believ∣eth what the gospel proposes to be believ∣ed: Therefore, the objection of course falls unto the ground.</P>
<P>Every man, proposing a system unto his fellow-creatures, doth it with a view that they should believe it; be it true or false; so also, when <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ,</HI> and salvation in him before they appre∣hend him, is taught the people; is it not with a view that they should believe it; and believing, rejoice, with joy unspeaka∣ble and full of Glory? It certainly is: and therefore, is not designed to keep them in unbelief. Again, it is the word of God, whereby Faith conies. The de∣claration, even unto Un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el evers, of their warfare accomplished, and their iniqui∣ties pardoned as well attested in the scrip∣tures, <PB N="92" REF="046269_0125_10211706A9AEB720"/>hath certainly a more genuine ten∣dency to produce faith and confidence in God, than to tell them, if they will believe, &amp;c. they shall be justified, their sins be expiated and forgiven: However smooth∣ly and artfully this may be worded, it is impossible to free it from the idea of con∣dition, and what is yet worse, such a con∣dition, as Man hath neither wisdom, will nor power to fulfill; yea, it is still in ef∣fect to preach the Law. Believe, and thou shalt be saved, is certainly similar unto, <HI>Do this end live</HI>: Man, in himself, being as capable of doing the one as the other. When Mankind are taught, that their eternal salvation depends upon be∣lieving, (and what is yet more strange, believing a matter which is not fact until believed) it is natural for every man, whose conscience is alarmed, to attempt it; but the more he endeavours, the far∣ther he is off; like rowing against a vi∣olent stream: the dread of coming short through unbelief, and his weakness and utter incapacity to believe, rus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es upon him like a torrent, bears him back with violence: until discouraged and enerva∣ted, he sinks, overwhelmed with sear and bondage. Indeed, where believing <PB N="93" REF="046269_0126_1021170AF5E5E5B8"/>is only respected as a bare assent unto a proposition, Mankind may with some shadow of Reason talk of their Abilities and of the easiness of the condition, pre∣tending that it is an instance of the richest freest grace, where salvation is promised upon believing. But it is not always practicable with a mind that is in earnest to assent unto a <HI>human</HI> proposition with∣out demonstration; much less respecting <HI>divine</HI> things, because, the difficulty in be∣lieving, increases in proportion to the magnitude, and con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernment of the mat∣ter believed, which difficulty, is owing unto the propensity of Human Nature, to an evil Heart of unbelief, unto the re∣moteness of Heavenly things from our natural ideas, and their contrariety unto our senses. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ve a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thou s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lt be sav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪,</HI> (equal to any other Law precept) when enforced upon the mind of man, generat∣ing with his weakness, begets unbelief, and fear, but never produceth faith▪ That comes only by the word of Life, that word which bringeth salvation, which preaches peace by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> declaring <HI>him</HI> as made of God unto us, <HI>Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dom, R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghteous<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, Sanctif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ation and R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mp∣tion,</HI> that whosoever glorieth, should glory <PB N="94" REF="046269_0127_1021170E0EEF3E00"/>in the Lord. The belief of the Truth, cometh by hearing of its perfection, reali∣ty, and immutability: Of our being de∣livered from the curse in him who was made a curse for us, of our being saved in him, with an everlasting salvation, of his being such an High-priest as becometh us: In brief, of our oneness with <HI>him,</HI> and indisputable right from thence, to consider ourselves according unto <HI>him,</HI> as our Head and Hatband. Thus whilst men are <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> upon believing in order to save themselves, but are taught calmly to hear the word that bringeth salvation, they according to the power of the Holy Ghost, either instantaneously, or gradually credit the report: And consequently en∣ter into the belief of the Truth, without their once <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> to believe, or troub∣ling or perplexing themselves about it. Whilst such who are more concerned about their <HI>believing,</HI> then the truth of Christ, are distressed under the difficulty yea, the impossibility of their performing it, when they have exerted themselves to the utmost. Therefore as the doctrine of <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ</HI> (before Faith) and sal∣vation in him, appears in this light, <HI>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> the word by which faith cometh, nothing <PB N="95" REF="046269_0128_10211711274B95E8"/>is more notorious than the unreasonable∣ness of the objection, that it makes void faith.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But doth not such an <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ</HI> destroy his pre-eminence, tending to exalt Man, to the degrading of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> By no means; it rather estab∣lisheth his pre-eminence; where the <HI>people</HI> as the <HI>members</HI> by <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>him</HI> the <HI>Head,</HI> are chosen, beloved, called, saved and accepted of God.

Christ in his of∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> capacity, answers unto the idea of the human body; which being one, is com∣posed of many members: The Church being his Body, is composed of many people: Of which, he himself is a mem∣ber, <PB N="96" REF="046269_0129_10211712AF7F0AD8"/><HI>viz.</HI> the Head, the pre-eminent, and most highly exalted; upon whom all the members are dependent, for honour; the <HI>Head only,</HI> wearing the Crown: For unc∣tion, the <HI>Head only</HI> was anointed: For all blessings, the <HI>Head only</HI> receives them immediately from God; being always the medium between <HI>him</HI> and the Body, and appointed, to guide, influence &amp; nou∣rish is. Every member brings its tribute unto the Head, and with praise, confes∣seth his pre-eminence: Whilst the Head is not ashamed to call them brethren. The more highly they perceive themselves exalted, the more glorious and eminent the Head appears before them: For as much as through all exaltations in time and eternity; a just and proportionable distinction is kept up and maintained, between the Head and Members, in dig∣nity, beauty and glory: And this all the members know, when influenced by their Head; therefore the Doctrine of <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ,</HI> doth not destroy his pre∣eminence, nor exalt mankind unto his dishonour.</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iii. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> To intimate that <HI>Jesus</HI> was a sinner, in thought, word or deed, is what I never intended, but would abhor the thought, as highly blasphemous: Nay, the prince of this world when he came, having nothing in him; was therefore constrained to appear in visible form and tempt him by his outward senses. He was holy, harmless, undefiled, and sepa∣rate from sinners, made higher than the Heavens; this was his proper personal individual character; and in this sense the Apostle is to be understood speaking, when he saith the just died for the unjust. But then we are told by another Apostle, <HI>that he</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> God) <HI>hath made him sin for us, who knew to sin,</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 21.</NOTE> from which it ap∣pears, that he who in his individual cha∣racter was sinless, was yet notwithstand∣ing, as the Head and Representative of the Church, made sin, yea <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade a curse for us: And under that character was punished with that Death, and condem∣nation <PB N="98" REF="046269_0131_1021171768CE26D8"/>nation, which was due to Man's offence. And this accounting of him a sinner, in the eye of justice, as it was equitable, so was it not from any personal guile; for he knew no sin: But from his <HI>Union</HI> unto the sinful people which rendered the punishment of <HI>their</HI> sin upon <HI>him,</HI> an act of divine and strict justice. Thus it ap∣pears, that the doctrine of <HI>Union,</HI> which represents <HI>Jesus</HI> suffering under the cha∣racter of the sinner, doth not suppose him such in his own particular person; nay, strongly witnesseth the contrary, and res∣pects him only thus, by such an imputa∣tion, as (considered on the Article of <HI>U∣nion</HI>) is just and true, with God and Man.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> This doctrine of <HI>Union,</HI> as it speaks of our being one with Christ, in all he did, and suffered, seems contrary unto his testimony by the Prophet; where he says, <HI>I have trodden the wine press alone, and of the people there is none with me.</HI>

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is evident from the words, that his meaning is; he received no <PB N="99" REF="046269_0132_1021171D4E8F37F8"/>help, or assistance from the people; this the fifth verse sheweth, <HI>I looked and there was none to help, &amp;c. therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me.</HI> The doctrine of <HI>Union</HI> contains no such proposition as this, that the people were fellow-helpers with Christ, when he attoned for sin, and destroyed the enemies of their salvation; In this sense, they were not with him. In this sense we were not with <HI>Adam</HI> when he sinned, we were not abetting, concur∣ring and active in his offence; and yet we were in him, according unto <HI>Union</HI>; in him offending in the great transgression.</P>
<P>We were also <HI>with Christ,</HI> and <HI>in</HI> him, thro' all he did and suffered, though no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> active, not aiding or assisting in his obe∣dience, nor enduring any part of his tor∣ments, according to our sensation. In this sense, <HI>he trod the wine press alone, and of the people there was none with him.</HI> And where the scriptures speak of our being <HI>in</HI> him, of being crucified <HI>with</HI> him, raised <HI>with</HI> him, sitting in heavenly places <HI>in</HI> him, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> as they evidently speak of these things according to <HI>Union</HI>; so, when compared with our Saviour's say∣ing by the prophet, before mentioned; it appears that we were <HI>in</HI> him, and <HI>with</HI> <PB N="100" REF="046269_0133_1021171ED581E3D0"/>him, through all; but not a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; we were altogether in a slate of Passivity, whilst the toil, and torment, was wholly his. Yet through all, he was greatly con∣scious of his including the people in him∣self, his Life and Death, being that of the whole Body, for <HI>if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it.</HI> Thus, though we were not with him, as helping, or assist∣ing him according to the Prophet; yet were we always <HI>in</HI> him and <HI>with</HI> him, ac∣cording to the grace of <HI>Union</HI> so abun∣dantly taught in the scriptures. The ob∣jections already mentioned, and which I have answered, being those which chiefly arise in the minds of serious unprejudiced persons against the doctrine of <HI>Union</HI>; I shall not consider any more at present, as I do not intend any thing controversial, and have no expectation of pleasing the captions.</P>
<P>I shall proceed to consider as proposed at first, a few of the never-failing springs of consolation, which arise from the Grace of <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And first, that the harmony of the di∣vine Perfections (as manifestly establish∣ed in the Grace of <HI>Union</HI>) is a consolato∣ry consideration, every man apprehend∣ING <PB N="101" REF="046269_0134_1021172292C822D0"/>it, can abundantly testify: We can have no confidence towards God, whilst we imagine that his attributes are contra∣ry to us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Should it be objected, that the perfections of the Deity, by reason of his infinite greatness and glory, are unknown to us; that we have no <HI>certainty</HI> about them, and therefore that it's arbitrary to attempt the proof of any thing thereby. I would answer, <HI>Whosoever cometh unto God must believe that he is.</HI> But, how to be∣lieve that he is, how to conceive of a Being with∣out properties, I know not: I therefore must conceive of the divine Being, according to such properties of his Nature, as <HI>instinct,</HI> rectified by <HI>revelation,</HI> suggests. God is a Being infinite in <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI>: and <HI>Goodness</HI> diversified, is Justice, Truth, Purity, Love, Mercy, &amp;c. Should it be objected, that by reason of ignorance, it's possible our ideas of Justice, Truth, Mercy, Love, &amp;c. may not be strictly true, and consist∣ent with the nature of such properties: especi∣ally when we ascribe them to God. <HI>Answ.</HI> God deals with us according to revelation, and re∣quires us to determine of things thereby: The Apostle faith, <HI>That the Gentiles which have not the Law, are a Law unto themselves; having the Law written upon their hearts, accusing or excusing them</HI>; suggesting to them, such a thing is just, and such unjust; <HI>this</HI> is true, <HI>that</HI> is false; <HI>this</HI> mercy; but <HI>that's</HI> cruelty: <HI>such</HI> is love, and <HI>such</HI> is ha∣tred; the <HI>one</HI> they approved of as <HI>good,</HI> and ascribed to the divine being, as his nature and properties; and the <HI>other</HI> they censured as <HI>bad,</HI> and thereby distinguished all evil beings. This simple voice of nature, differs from revelation only as the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ser</HI> light which rules the Night, differs from the <HI>greater</HI> which rules the Day: And what is discoverable by the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ser</HI> light, is much more so by the <HI>greater</HI>: For revelation reflecting upon those innate principles, throws such a light around us, that we can come much further, see more clearly, and determine with greater certainty. Thus our natural ideas of Justice, Truth, Mercy, Love, &amp;c. (as simple before debauched with passion and prejudice) are improved by the scriptures: Until he dis∣cern the infinite difference between the nature of God, and the nature of man; the <HI>former</HI> ap∣pears Holy, Just, True, Merciful and Gracious, whilst the <HI>latter</HI> is quite the reverse: every man living being altogether vanity. If its possible those our ideas of the divine perfections should be wrong, then have we no rule whereby to discern between good and evil; we may give up the scriptures, renounce the evidence of na∣ture, shut our ears to its voice, and commence Scepticks in right earnest: we may no longer reprove any thing a Man can possibly be capa∣ble of, for fear lost from a wrong idea of the disine perfection, we should reprove the Good. And yet such is the pride of Man, that rather than he will be thought ignorant, or give up any indefensible Tenet imbibed, he will shelter himself from the attacks of Truth under such pleas as these: How know we whether our ideas of the divine perfections are right or not thus to sap the argument of his antagonist, he would fain remove the foundation, yea renounce the only Authority which <HI>he</HI> or <HI>any other</HI> has to conclude his own tenets right. Where the scriptures are acknowledged, the divine perfec∣tions are confess'd the <HI>origin</HI> of that revelation: the <HI>latter</HI> being always considered as a tran∣script of <HI>his</HI> nature and properties: And there we find Him declared Holy, Just, Righteous, True, Wife, Merciful, Love, &amp;c. Nor hath he left us in the dark concerning the meaning of those Terms; but by his commands, promises, threatnings and prohibitions, and in the later Days more perfectly by the Doctrine and Ex∣ample of his Son; he hath distinguished the <HI>good</HI> from the <HI>evil,</HI> separating between the precious and the vile. After <HI>such</HI> an exhibition of the divine properties, we are no longer at a loss to conceive of them with certainty; but are taught to look for Truth in the harmony of them: it being found there, and only there. True it is, no man can comprehend <HI>him,</HI> nor by <HI>searching find him out to perfection</HI>: Nay we see but in part, we know but in part; nevertheless, we <HI>apprehend</HI> and <HI>conceive</HI> of him, and by what we understand of him, we determine with certain∣ty: Therefore, whatsoever appears contrary to his perfections, according to what we appre∣hend of him, must be <HI>much</HI> more contrary with <HI>him,</HI> in proportion as his excellencies and self∣knowledge exceeds what we can possibly know of him: And here all proportion fails, and is lost for ever.</NOTE> And, I am persuaded that <PB N="102" REF="046269_0135_102117242BE2B5F0"/>this imagination is very natural unto all such who have seen human nature in its <PB N="103" REF="046269_0136_1021172C05C5F378"/>ruins; and, striving with all wisdom, power, and diligence, to repair its breach∣es, <PB N="104" REF="046269_0137_1021172D8DF84B40"/>have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound that their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>most efforts, have been like untempered.

Where persons have been thus ex∣ercised, (tho' they might at times have a saint hope in the mercy of God) they have thought it inconsistent with his jus∣tice, and purity to save them from the wrath to come. But when the grace of <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ</HI> is manifest unto them, they can see all things consist by him; <HI>mercy and truth are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> together, righte∣ousness and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed each other.</HI></P>
<P>Mankind may now rejoice in the jus∣tice, and purity of God; yea appeal unto him as just, as holy, as faithful, because according unto <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ,</HI> justice hath been satisfied in his blood shedding and death: Where <HI>they</HI> in him, and <HI>he</HI> in them, have been fully punished for all their iniquity: Upon which the Lord faith, <HI>their sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and iniquities will I remem∣ber no more.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. 10. 17.</NOTE> Hence he is just to forgive their sins, and to cleanse them from all un∣righteousness. Yea, according unto his <PB N="105" REF="046269_0138_1021172F174CC860"/>holiness, may they now have con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in him. Though his eyes are pur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r than to behold iniquity, they may approach him, and stand before him with boldness, being by <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ,</HI> sanctified in him, holy in him, yea he himself is their holiness: When <HI>this</HI> is discerned, we are no longer terrified at the boldness of the divine nature, but have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of <HI>Jesus</HI>; yea have unspeakable delight in the holiness of God, and infinite expectations there∣from. As the promise is to such who confess and forsake their sin, it is fulfilled upon us in <HI>Jesus</HI>; all the promises of God being in him, yea, and in him, <HI>Amen.</HI> There have we, (with all the prayers, and supplications, strong crying and tears which <HI>Jesus</HI> offered in the days of his flesh) confessed our sins unto God; and where he (having plunged our sin) ap∣peared the second time without in unto salvation, we have eternally forsaken them: Therefore we appeal unto the faithfulness of him who hath promised. In this blessed <HI>Union,</HI> this infinite love and grace of God our Father, unto us in <HI>Christ Jesus</HI>; we see the harmony of his nature in all his dealings with us, and can <PB N="106" REF="046269_0139_10211731235EA060"/>sing with untold delight, thou art glori∣ous forever, our Father and our God, thou art love, thou art mercy, thou art righte∣ousness, thou art justice, thou art holiness, thou art faithfulness, thou art truth, holy and reverend is thy name, O Lord God of hosts! And yet all thy glo∣rious perfections agree in one, to accept us, delight in us, rejoice over us, and bless us with eternal life, and all its happiness in <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> our Lord.</P>
<P>Again, in this gracious <HI>Union,</HI> the scriptures are all fulfilled; and the Key of <HI>David</HI> given <HI>us,</HI> that <HI>we</HI> may open, what no man can shut, and shut what no man can open. When men who are strangers unto this <HI>Union,</HI> take it upon them to expound the scriptures, it is ama∣zing to see with what contradictions and inconsistencies it abounds! The precept, the threatening, the promise, and gracious declaration, are all jumbled together; often overthrowing by one, what they have set up by the other. But in <HI>Christ</HI> they all agree in one: in him the precept is fulfilled, the threatening endured, the promised reward received, and the free and eternal salvation of God, continually <PB N="107" REF="046269_0140_102117392D579EC8"/>embracing the Children of Men: There∣fore, standing in the Grace of <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ,</HI> we are at peace with all the scrip∣tures. <HI>He</HI> in us and <HI>we</HI> in him, have fulfilled all righteousness, fully kept the commandments of God, and suffered the punishment due unto our sins, and now inherit the promise, whilst the voice of words, yea every terrifying sound is si∣lenced; and nothing now heard but the sound of Grace, Love, and good will. <HI>Jesus</HI> is now the shield of our Faith, by which we resist the fiery darts of the wicked one, would he come upon us with the threatening; and urge, because we answer the Character of the Sinner threat∣ened, it must be executed upon us. Unto this fiery dart we oppose our shield <HI>Christ,</HI> as <HI>made a curse for us:</HI> would he set be∣fore us the Precept, and insist, on our de∣struction, because we cannot fulfil it; we still hold up our shield, and plead <HI>Christ the end of the Law for righteousness.</HI> Will he trouble us about the promises, and urge that God is either unfaithful, (who hath promised) otherwise we are not the people unto whom they are made, because we do not inherit them, have not the pure heart, the right spirit, do not yet see all <PB N="108" REF="046269_0141_1021173AB33FE750"/>things put under our feet, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> our shield is still our defence; we answer <HI>but we see Jesus,</HI> and can testify that he who hath promised, is faithful; for <HI>Jesus</HI> hath the clean Heart, the right Spirit, the Heart which hath the Law written therein, that it may not depart from God; we see all things put under his feet, <HI>insomuch that all the promises of God are in him, yea, and in him,</HI> Amen. Where <HI>Union</HI> with <HI>Christ</HI> is manifest; it is enough for salvation and happiness, in time and eternity, that <HI>he</HI> hath suffered, that <HI>he</HI> was obedient, that the promise is fulfilled in <HI>him,</HI> because being joint heirs with <HI>him,</HI> we have a just claim unto <HI>his</HI> inheritance; hither are we led unto righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost. <HI>This man is our Peace,</HI> yea even when the <HI>Assyrian</HI> comes into the land; our <HI>Union</HI> with him is our se∣curity and defence against the face of the enemy: and as I have hinted before, his fiery darts cannot hurt the soul that abides in <HI>him</HI>; we are then able to resist them all, by holding up our shield, by opposing <HI>Christ</HI> unto all: He being <HI>our Sun and our Shield,</HI> not only our shield for defence, but our sun to enlighten and quicken us unto the use thereof. Did men but know <PB N="109" REF="046269_0142_1021173C3AE62BB8"/>what safety and peace we have here, they would despair of terrifying us, as they hope to do, by their writings and preach∣ments: loading us with opprobrious names, and ignorantly levelling the threat∣enings and cursings in the scriptures a∣gainst us. Beholding <HI>him</HI> to be the death of <HI>Death,</HI> and the victory of Hell; and how he hath hid us in the secret of his pavilion, from the strife of Tongues, they would either join the Angels song, <HI>Glory be to God on high, on earth peace and good will towards men;</HI> or else, despairing of making us miserable, their enmity sting∣less towards us, but gnawing to their own bosoms, would so increase their torment, that they would willingly cease from us, forget us and let us alone. What is im∣possible with Man, is possible with God. If we read the Scriptures out of <HI>Christ,</HI> they require impossibilities of us: hence it is, that some who are aware of this, and yet ignorant of the power of God, are o∣bliged to have recourse unto new Laws; Laws of their own making, where, by a sincere intention and all possible obedi∣ence, they would evade the force of the scripture perfection, and put a foil upon the sword of the spirit; But truth needs <PB N="110" REF="046269_0143_1021173E110EF180"/>no artifice; unto this sword, unso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, sharp and two-edged as it is, piercing through the soul and spirit, joints and marrow, discerning the thoughts and in∣tents of the heart, <HI>Jesus</HI> bared his Bosom; and sheathing it in his own Heart's Blood, the divine glutinating power thereof, hath rendered it impossible to draw it again to another execution: God is just and true, and <HI>will not;</HI> Men or Devils <HI>cannot.</HI></P>
<P>When we read the scriptures in <HI>Christ,</HI> we determine according to the possibility of things with God, unto him who be∣lieveth, all things are possible. The im∣possibilities and jarrings, with which the letter abounds; such as the demands of perfect obedience, of satisfaction for sin, of salvation by Grace, by <HI>Works,</HI> of the forgiveness of sin by <HI>Christ,</HI> and yet judged according to the deeds done in the <HI>body,</HI> and giving an account at that day for every idle word, &amp;c. all this I say hath its harmony and perfection in <HI>Jesus,</HI> nor have all the Masters in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> for these seven∣teen hundred years, (though there have always been those who attempt it,) been able to point out a reconciliation, and har∣mony of scripture out of him. But in <PB N="111" REF="046269_0144_1021174592CE02B8"/>him, as the representative of Man, as hav∣ing the people in himself, and he in them, the preceptive part is fulfilled perfectly; and all the threatenings executed upon the sinner in him; in <HI>him</HI> saved by Grace, in him justified by works, accepted in <HI>him</HI> having redemption in <HI>his blood the for∣giveness of sin.</HI> Our account for the idle word, is that in ourselves we are carnal, sold under sin, and have no good thing; but, that in Christ we are filled, in <HI>him sanctified,</HI> in <HI>him</HI> accepted, &amp; therefore ap∣peal from the first <HI>Adam,</HI> unto the second. In like manner we account for the deeds done in the Body, <HI>Jesus</HI> having attoned for the evil, and done the good. These, and all other parts of scripture, which may appear in a critical, and contradictory fight, unto a person who hath not yet ap∣prehended the <HI>Union,</HI> is yet nevertheless consistent, harmonious and gracious, un∣to all such who know what it is to be one with Christ, Christ with them. In this light we can read the scriptures with pleasure, in seeing all fulfilled in him, every dark saying opening up in him, and he gloriously triumphant, filling all in all. We also read them profitably, forasmuch as speaking thus of Christ they hush, and <PB N="112" REF="046269_0145_102117471A86E8A8"/>banish the fears arising from nature, or temptation;—They fortify the mind a∣gainst the face of the enemy, cherish and support us, under all the vicissitudes of life: And when depressed, beneath the sense of human nature in its ruins, they present us with a glorious prospect of im∣mortality, in the perfect resemblance, and likeness of <HI>Jesus</HI>; and to warm, and re∣fresh the mind more effectually, they bring the prospect near, and shew us <HI>now</HI> the workmanship of God created anew in <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> now passed from Death unto Life, it is done saith <HI>Jesus,</HI> I am <HI>Alpha,</HI> and <HI>Omeg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>
<P>Again from the Grace and truth of <HI>U∣nion,</HI> the Christian hath a right to reckon of himself, of his state, and condition to∣wards God, according to Christ; accord∣ing to the date and condition which he is in: Hence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the Apostle <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yourselves to be Dead indeed unto sin, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> alive unto God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jesus Christ our Lord..</HI>

Yea, not only dead unto sin, whereby we are exempted from its filth, guilt and condemnation: But we are to reckon ourselves positively Holy, Righteous, and Fruitful, <HI>alive unto God!</HI> and that in opposition to all we see, feel, or understand of ourselves, according to sense. What are we then to reckon of our selves by? by <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord; let the Heavens rejoice, and the Earth be glad, for the Lord hath <HI>raised up a horn of salvation, in the House of his servant</HI> DAVID <HI>according to the mouth of all his Prophets which have been since the world began.

<P>Moreover, in the grace of <HI>Union</HI> the Foundations are raised, and a glorious truth presented unto our view; which as it is perfect, and permanent, before our believing; so is it, if at any time we should be overtaken with unbelief and doubtfulness. This is that which at first authorizes, excites and encourages us to credit the Gospel report. This is that, which strengthens in us what is often <PB N="117" REF="046269_0150_102117559A7573E8"/>ready to die. This is that which raises us when fallen, which bring us back when we have wandered, and affords strong Consolation, unto all who have fled unto <HI>Jesus</HI> for refuge; hence if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> the righteous, &amp;c. whilst <HI>he</HI> wears the Character of righteous, <HI>we</HI> shall be accepted of God, and Glorious in his sight: And that is everlastingly, for <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is the <HI>same Yesterday, To-day and for ever.</HI> The Gospel is here a relation of facts, of who <HI>Jesus</HI> is, what he hath <HI>done,</HI> and that he hath loved us, hath <HI>saved</HI> us; hath washed, forgiven and ac∣cepted us; the divine beauty, and reason∣ableness of which, appears in the Grace of <HI>union.</HI> This Grace doth not require us, sophistically and unnaturally, to make that a truth by believing; which was not a truth before; but first proposes <HI>Jesus,</HI> as the truth, the grand original truth, be∣fore all things, and by whom all things consist. The Ocean whence the Rivers of Grace and Providence first had their rise, and whither (after having run through the intricasies of Time) they tend again, discharging, and emptying themselves of all their floods, into the Bo∣som <PB N="118" REF="046269_0151_1021175AA777DDD8"/>of that Mighty Deep whence they first received them: That his might be the kingdom, power and glory. That he is the truth of all the types, predictions, and prophecies of the Jews, the truth of wis∣dom, righteousness, holiness, redemption and salvation unto the Gentiles, is what the Gospel declares; affirming, illustrat∣ing, arguing, persuacing, until the arm of the Lord is revealed, and the report believed. Thus Faith cometh by hear∣ing, and hearing by the word of God. Hence, I would cry unto the Ends of the Earth, your warfare is accomplished, your iniquity is pardoned. You, who are lovers of Pleasure, pursuing the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of Life; as the highest, chiefest Good. Wherefore will you spend your money for that which is nought, and your labour for that which satisfieth not; wherefore will you thirst after vanity, and attempt filling your belly with the east wind?

<P>You, who with <HI>Esau</HI> have been seek∣ing Repentance with tears, and that for a long season, but have not yet found it: Unto you I also call, and ask you why will you die?

Thus <HI>Jacob</HI> is Grace, and <HI>Esau</HI> is Works, the one obtaining what he had not expected, nor sought after; Whilst the other, who sought it carefully with tears, obtained it not. Yea, and where there hath been a drawing back, a falling away from the truth as it is in <HI>Jesus,</HI> until sunk in Misery and Darkness, until having nothing left them to look at but themselves, they are affrighted, and at their wits end: Unto them would I call and exhort them not to sorrow as men without hope; because <HI>Jesus</HI> is alive, and <PB N="122" REF="046269_0155_102117651F4FD2C8"/>liveth for evermore. Your God and Fa∣ther,e is not disappointed in you; you have not deceived him: He never expect∣ed any thing from you, more, or less, than what he hath found. The satisfaction which he had in you at first, was behold∣ing you as the travail of his soul, and as such, he beholds you still. Your unbe∣lief cannot make his grace of none effect, and though you have denied him, yet he cannot deny himself. That which was a truth before you believed, at the first, <HI>viz. Christ</HI> being your <HI>Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption,</HI> is a truth now, even when you have ceased to be∣lieve: Insomuch, that in every time of need, though you have sadly departed from him, you have the same foundation, authority and encouragement, to believe and be assured as you had at the first. It is the scripture testimony of <HI>Jesus,</HI> what <HI>he</HI> is, and what <HI>he</HI> hath done, and suffered, that is the ground of our confidence; and not the reflection that <HI>we</HI> repent, believe, or obey; and it is most cer∣tain that this ground remaineth, that this foundation is unshaken, for <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is <HI>the same Yesterday, To-day, and for ever</HI>; and that <HI>our</HI> unbelief, or any change pas∣sing <PB N="123" REF="046269_0156_10211767F626B778"/>over <HI>us,</HI> as in ourselves, cannot alter him who is unchangeable, and always Righteous and accepted. In him we are always as He is, according to which simi∣litude God always beholds us, and accepts us; therefore, our change of frame or disposition, cannot change His views of us; for, as he only beholds us in <HI>Jesus,</HI> He can always say that <HI>he beholds no ini∣quity in</HI> Jacob, <HI>nor perverseness in</HI> Israel. <HI>The Lord his God is</HI> always <HI>with him, and the shout of a King is among them.</HI> O! glorious Grace! O triumphant Love! let him who is fallen from hence, say, rejoice not against me, O mine enemy, for though I fall, I shall yet arise. Doth not this testimony quicken unto faith, and confidence in <HI>Jesus!</HI> Doth it not obviate and silence <HI>all</HI> the complaints and objec∣tions of the broken and despairing Spirit, and bring back to the Saviour, that which was driven away? surely it does. Thus from the Grace of <HI>Union,</HI> which renders <HI>Jesus</HI> such an High Priest as becometh us, we obtain favour, and find Grace to help us in every time of need. Salvation and Perfection in <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord, by <HI>Union</HI> with Him, is that glo∣rious Truth, which first authorizes, en∣courages <PB N="124" REF="046269_0157_1021176B364979E8"/>and influences to believe: and that which preserves us spotless and ac∣ceptable unto God, when we fail to be∣lieve and credit his testimony; and infi∣nitely above all other considerations, hath a tendency to raise us in our hope and confidence towards God; and to preserve us from desperation. It is therefore un∣just and unnatural, to charge this Doctrine with having a tendency to indulge people in unbelief. Considering the condition of Man, and the testimony of <HI>Jesus,</HI> I would challenge all the masters of Israel, to produce a system more powerfully tending to reconcile Man unto God, and to raise the doubtful Soul unto confidence in Him: let all such who (through the experience of human weakness, or the power of temptation, are fallen from the faith of the Son of God, and sunk to the Hell of their senses, consider this matter, and renew their strength as Eagles.</P>
<P>Furthermore, from the grace of <HI>Union,</HI> we are taught to consider <HI>Jesus,</HI> as the hero of the scripture. All the members bring their tribute unto him, as the ex∣alted head. If what I have already aimed at proving, is true; that primarily as the <PB N="125" REF="046269_0158_1021176E8160D438"/>head of his body the church, all the pro∣mises were made unto him, all the threat∣enings fall upon him, &amp;c. then by him we inherit, by him we have atoned; we claim no good out of him, nor will we acknowledge the evil, for as much as in him we have been purged. All the beau∣teous characters in the scripture are his, and are only <HI>typical</HI> in the persons unto whom they are given in the letter; which is a∣bundantly evident, from the contrast ap∣pearing in every one of them; they be∣ing all guilty of vices, diametrically op∣posite to the virtues for which they are famous; Righteous <HI>Noah</HI> and <HI>Lot,</HI> both charged with Drunkenness, and one with horrid incest. Faithful <HI>Abraham</HI> with cistrust, meanness of spirit, lying or equi∣vocating, as in the case of <HI>Saran.</HI> Meek <HI>Moses,</HI> with unwarrantable passion, unad∣vised speech, and such swellings at the waters of strife as barred his entrance in∣to the promised land. It charges holy. <HI>David,</HI> the man after God's own heart, with such weaknesses and crimes, as are by no means consistent with holiness; but were a glaring proof of his heart being very unlike the heart of God. And <HI>Solo∣mon</HI> so famous for wisdom, had his dark∣side: <PB N="126" REF="046269_0159_10211771ED7BA570"/>how great were his follies! And whilst much might be said for his wisdom, how many instances might be given of the most stupid and God provoking fool∣ishness in him. <HI>Job</HI> also, admired for his patience, gave the most pregnant proofs of impatience and peevishness. It will be natural to inquire from hence, why the scriptures which gives those men the most beautiful and amiable characters, as righteous, faithful, meek, holy, wise and patient, should at the same time, present us with a contrast in each of them, drawn in such strong colours, that the most pal∣pable contradiction appears? The answer is easy, Let God be true and every man a liar. Those men were all types of <HI>Jesus,</HI> their characters figurative of his. there∣fore divine wisdom thought proper, not only to stain their glory, by suffering such blemishes in their spirit and conduct, as gave the lie unto their virtues, but also to record the same; that at best they might appear but meer shadows, reserving the substance for <HI>Jesus.</HI> Therefore, whoso reading the characters of those men, are not taught to look beyond them, unto the blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> have yet read the scriptures to little purpose; having not yet known <PB N="127" REF="046269_0160_102117750EC5C0E8"/>them, nor the power of God. Neither the Prophets nor Apostles wrote with the view that such who venerate their <HI>wri∣tings</HI> should have their <HI>persons</HI> in admi∣ration; neither theirs, whose character they drew, as eminent and famous, in the Church of God. But the spirit which mov∣ed them, designed through the whole, the honour and glory of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>: that pass∣ing on from every man, we might attain to the admiration of the person and excel∣lencies of <HI>Jesus,</HI> as the only Righteous, the only Faithful, the only Meek, Wife, Holy and Patient, until <HI>all</HI> with an un∣wavering. Tongue, shall cry, Thou art altogether Lovely, worthy is the Lamb of the Kingdom and Glory. But least any who are used to please themselves with Mankind, having men's persons in admi∣ration, should think we deal hardly with the saints of old, (for it is often found more dangerous, even among Christians, to speak lightly of the pious men, than it is to speak so of <HI>Christ</HI>) when we sav that they were not the men which they are represented to be, their conduct and behaviour considered:—I would here pre∣mise what will be equally obnoxious unto them, that those persons were really <PB N="128" REF="046269_0161_1021177821745C90"/>what the scriptures say they were, that is, Righteous, Faithful, Meek, Holy, Wise, Patient, &amp;c. without any exception: they were so in <HI>Christ.</HI> I know the Jew, however Christianised by Profession, will either rave or sneer at this; but let him; He that sitteth in the Heavens will laugh him to scorn: and the Christians <HI>indeed,</HI> will remain undisturbed. I would calm∣ly ask, what is the medium between <HI>Christ</HI> and Man?—If its not true of them in themselves, as I have shewn it is not; nor true of them in <HI>Christ,</HI> as the Greek and Jew insinuates, where is it true of them? It must have its <HI>truth</HI> somewhere; I speak unto you who acknowledge the scriptures. I am well aware of your Answer, viz. the Divine Wisdom characterises them according to what they were in <HI>part</HI> and not in the <HI>whole.</HI> I would ask ano∣ther question, Have we any other Rule for the trial of right and wrong, good and evil, than the Divine Law? And doth not the Law demand perfection? Doth it not when broken in one point, declare the transgressor guilty of the whole? Doth it not curse whomsoever continueth not to do all things written in the Book thereof? And <HI>Jesus</HI> saith, that Heaven and Earth <PB N="129" REF="046269_0162_1021177D16BDCAE8"/>shall pass away, but one jot or tittle of the Law shall not fail, until the whole be fulfilled. But having spoken of this mat∣ter before, I refer you unto it: and shall only observe here, the arrogance and im∣propriety of assuming the Character of Righteous, Meek, Faithful, Holy, &amp;c. according to the works of our own Hands or habits of the Heart: This is flying in the face of God, and giving the lie to the Divine Perfections as revealed in the Law; yea, it is in fact a denying our only Lord God and <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> for unto what Pur∣pose is he made Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption? Is it not that whosoever glorieth, should glory in the Lord? But when Persons assume those Characters from the consideration of what they are in part, as in themselves; they glory in themselves and not in the Lord. This is that Antichrist of whom we were told that He should come, yea, was so early in the World as the Days of the Apostles; and prevails so mightily in the Christian World at present that the generality of Christains under <HI>his</HI> influence, are upon a level in Faith and Doctrine with the Jews: or but very faintly distinguished from them: The <HI>Jew</HI> maintains the necessity <PB N="130" REF="046269_0163_102117803AD21B00"/>of inward, and outward holiness in every Man, and looks for the <HI>Christ</HI> to come: The <HI>Christian,</HI> especially the reformed, with superior ardour, and repeated asse∣verations, declares for the same way of holiness, and looks also for a <HI>Christ</HI> to come; an inward Christ, consisting of gracious habits, pious breathings, sincere and upright dispositions, and which in effect, is to agree with the Jew, in declar∣ing, that the Man of Galilee, who was crucified without the Gates of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in the reign of <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erius,</HI> was not the true <HI>Christ:</HI> Or according to the <HI>highest Idea</HI> of him, was but the figure of an inward and Spiritual <HI>Christ</HI> to come: thus Anti∣christianly denying the true <HI>Christ</HI> is come in the Flesh. Again there are others, who would be distinguished from the <HI>Jew,</HI> by confessing that the true <HI>Messiah</HI> is come, and that according to his Obedience, Death and Resurrection, he is the remote cause of Man's Salvation. But, then it seems if he is not applied, he is no <HI>Christ</HI> at all. Hence it is, that many who call themselves Preachers of the Gospel of <HI>Je∣sus,</HI> make use of this expression, <HI>An unap∣plied Christ is no Christ at all.</HI> What can a <HI>Christian</HI> think of such a vile Phrase a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this?</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="046269_0164_10211781C503D040"/>
This is in effect to make <HI>Christ</HI> a meer Quality, a Dispensation, which <HI>exists</HI> and takes place, upon a certain change wrought in the Creature: A <HI>Christ</HI> created, and made by application.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jesus Christ</HI> as the only Good, the true Balm, was applied unto <HI>our</HI> Wounds and Diseases, when he took part of the same Flesh and Blood with the Children. And, as a Plaister, or Medicine, when applied, must <HI>unite,</HI> and become <HI>One,</HI> with the Wound or Disease, that by its superior Vir∣tue, it might drain, swallow up, and eradicate the opposite evil; so, <HI>Jesus,</HI> united unto <HI>our</HI> infirm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, bare our Sins and Sicknesses, and carried our Sorrows; <HI>purging them</HI> by himself, through the things which he suffered, until his resurrection fully proved the Evil eradicated. Hence <HI>he dieth no more, Death hath no more Do∣minion over him.</HI> Thus, the Grace and Love of <HI>God,</HI> was applied to the misery of <HI>Man,</HI> in the person of <HI>Emmanuel</HI>; and all our Grievances redressed in Him. He, being according to the Condition of his <HI>Person</HI> and <HI>Office,</HI> the Physician, Medicine and Patient. <HI>With his stripes we are healed.</HI> Of <HI>this</HI> Grace and Truth, the Holy Ghost is our witness; who is said to receive of the things which are <HI>Christ</HI>'s, that he might shew them to the people. Hence, it is called in the Scriptures, a Manifestation, a Revelation, or Declaration, but never an Application as I re∣member: This being rather an adopted Phrase of Antichrist, to give false Ideas on such an oc∣casion; even such, that are most derogatory to the Person, Death and Resurrection of <HI>Jesus,</HI> Far be it from me, to aim at making any man an Offender for a Word: but, where Words are expressive of Facts, and of singular import, designed to form Ideas, it is right to inquire whether they are <HI>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> or not and, upon inquiry, it will be found, that the word <HI>Appli∣cation,</HI> is not, when used as expressive of believ∣ing the Gospel or receiving Christ; especially where it is asserted, that <HI>an unapplied Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, no Christ at all.</HI> Is not this to make his <HI>office,</HI> yea his very <HI>Being,</HI> to depend upon such an ap∣plication? a most shocking Proposition! and abhorred of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, who conceive of <HI>Christ</HI> accord∣ing to the scriptures.</NOTE> And yet, how we <PB N="132" REF="046269_0165_10211784E68C7438"/>should apply what doth not exist, or is not true before, is, I confess, a subtilty which I do not understand; and therefore, the Phrase appears to me as ridiculously <HI>Nonsensical,</HI> as it is <HI>Blasphemous:</HI> and the latter it is, if it has <HI>any</HI> meaning; because it is certainly a denial of the Person of <HI>Christ,</HI> and setting up of another <HI>Jesus:</HI> such a one as the Apostle feared would corrupt the Corinthians, from the sim∣plicity which was in <HI>Christ.</HI> Our Saviour foretold the arising of false <HI>Christs,</HI> (and every <HI>Christ</HI> hath his Prophets) and that they should shew great Signs and Wonders. Except a few, vain, insignificant Preten∣ders amongst the blinded <HI>Jews,</HI> who were <PB N="133" REF="046269_0166_102117866E83E1F8"/>not able to shew any great signs or won∣ders, but from Pride and Lunacy, dreamt they were somebody; I say, excepting those, I never heard of any one, who pre∣tended to be the <HI>Christ.</HI> And, if any poor Lunatick has at any time talked wildly of his being the <HI>Christ,</HI> he hath not deceived any Body, neither could he shew great signs and wonders. Therefore, <HI>those</HI> could not be the false <HI>Christ</HI> spoken of, and yet the word of the Lord is true; false <HI>Christ</HI> there must be, and I think it be∣hoves us to inquire what they are. False <HI>Christs</HI> are things which bear the name of <HI>Christ,</HI> and have that Honor, Power and Glory attributed unto them, which belongs only to <HI>Jesus of Nazareth:</HI> a prevailing Deception, attested by great Signs and Wonders. If false <HI>Christs</HI> are those things which are called <HI>Christ,</HI> and are not, I think it is not impossible to find them out, and to prove that they are now in the World, and have deceived many. The false <HI>Christ</HI> is a compound of Pride, Darkness, De∣ceit, Self-love, Enmity to the true Christ, &amp;c. but then it bears the names of Humi∣lity, the Light within, Faithfulness, Truth, Love to God, and Zeal for Holiness; (in contradistinction to that dangerous pro∣position <PB N="134" REF="046269_0167_1021178875635BC0"/>of salvation by the Blood of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> alone, and of being compleat in Him though sinners in ourselves,) where Mankind are ignorant of the scriptures, and of the power of God, and yet, <HI>reading</HI> and <HI>hearing</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> being in them, and being also bid to examine themselves whe∣ther <HI>Christ</HI> be in them, they look into themselves; thus enquiring, have I <HI>Christ,</HI> do I love God, and hate iniquity? am I changed? am I humble, heavenly-mind∣ed, thirsting to be more holy, and lament∣ing my faults? do I increase in Light, Knowledge and Understanding? If I do, then I have <HI>Christ:</HI> this is <HI>Christ in me the hope of Glory.</HI> This is the <HI>Christ</HI> whom many look unto, and respect as the <HI>true Christ.</HI> This hath its great Signs, and Wonders. This pretends to cast out De∣vils and to work such changes in Man∣kind, as answers to the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> changing his skin, and the <HI>Leopard</HI> his spots, pretends to produce signs of it, in such, or such per∣sons once greatly vicious but now made either <HI>perfectly Holy,</HI> or in a great <HI>measure</HI> so; even perfect in <HI>parts</HI> if that can be understood. Furthermore, the consider∣ations of this great Change, and the feel∣ing of its holy Tempers and Dispositions, <PB N="135" REF="046269_0168_1021179190D013C0"/>is a Contemplation so ravishing, a Sensa∣tion, or Frame of Spirit so transporting, that it triumphs over the Fears of Death and Hell, and anticipating the Joys and Powers of the World to come, makes the Deceived cry out, partly in the words of the Apostle, <HI>Who shall lay any thing to the Charge of God's Elect? Who shall condemn?</HI> But then, taking liberty to differ from <HI>Paul,</HI> instead of founding it with him upon this fact, <HI>Christ died and rose again:</HI> the Disciples of the false <HI>Christ</HI> rather cry, <HI>Who shall Condemn?</HI> I am converted, I believe, I bear the fruits of the Spirit, I have the marks of Grace in me! <HI>Who shall lay any thing to the Charge of God's Elect?</HI> and I am certainly one, for he has distinguished me from my Neighbours! and made me holy as the Elect of God; thanks be to God, I have, by much assiduity in all the ordinances, by constant application unto all the means of Grace, at last, made my <HI>Calling and Flection sure:</HI> and now how happy, how blest am I! Come Life, come Death, I am ready: Thus can the false <HI>Christ</HI> shew great Signs and Wonders. True it is, this is ascribed to different causes; one cries, Why me, Why me, <PB N="136" REF="046269_0169_1021179316EC7FF0"/>What am I that I should be so blest! and talks of discriminating Grace, as though God was a respecter of persons. Whilst another says, O blessed Self-denial and Patience: Now I am blest with the fruit of my labours and sorrows, I shall never repent of my Watchings, Fastings and Prayers, nor of the grievous Mortifica∣tions I have pass'd through, since I am possess'd of that holiness wherein I can see God. Whilst a Third exults, that he has not been misled by that <HI>outward</HI> and <HI>carnal Christ,</HI> who <HI>might</HI> probably suffer in the reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> without the Gates of <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> But that he has been obe∣dient to the true <HI>spiritual Christ,</HI> who was always in him from his Mother's Womb, sometimes as a Spirit of Burning convin∣cing of sin, at other times as a spirit of <HI>Judgment</HI> or a Light shining in a dark place; shewing him what was right, with the path wherein he should walk: that he hath had the faithfulness to follow this <HI>Christ,</HI> and not as many of his Fellow∣mortals, resisted the Light, is now the Joy of his Heart. Thus however things are ascribed to different causes, and diffe∣rent terms made use of, yet the same <HI>mat∣ter</HI> is intended; and all come to this <PB N="137" REF="046269_0170_10211794E3B816B8"/>point at last: that the true <HI>Christ</HI> is a compound of religious qualities, and holy dispositions in Men. Hence it is, that human Virtue is idolized, and complimen∣ted with the Name of <HI>Christian,</HI> upon <HI>this principle</HI> even the Heathen Phisophers are supposed to have had <HI>Christ</HI> in them: es∣pecially <HI>such</HI> amongst them who were fa∣mous for their piety, tho' <HI>Heathen.</HI> Yea according to <HI>this,</HI> it is enough to have <HI>ap∣pearances</HI> to whine, and cant, talk much of the work of the Spirit of the Heart
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I would not be understood as speaking slightly of the Spirit of <HI>Truth,</HI> or of his operations in the Heart of Man, according to the scripture account thereof: which, is there undeniably made to consist in receiving of the Things which are his, (viz. Christ's,) and in shewing them unto us: that Jesus Christ alone might be glorified: and this the Spirit is constantly engaged in, until we answer fully in Heart, and Mind, unto the Character of the true cir∣cumcision; <HI>who worship God in the spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</HI> But the Spirit of Error, reverses this Character▪ pretends to shew mankind other excellencies than what are found in <HI>Jesus,</HI> such as refor∣mations, changes, pious motions and desires in themselves: and this it doth, until their worship of God dwindle into Form, their rejoicing be in the work of their own Hands, and all their confidence be in things of the Flesh.</P>
<P>Antichrist, or the false Spirit, seeks not the Glory of <HI>Jesus</HI>; but speaks of himself, of its own operations: of Joys, Sorrows, Hatred to the Evil, and Languishment after Goodness; by him wrought on the Heart: and teaches his anointed ones, to conclude <HI>thence,</HI> that they are favourites of Heaven: to look on themselves as greatly distinguished amongst Mankind, by what they call inherent holiness: Yea, and to be Jealous of the Doctrine of <HI>Christ,</HI> because it holds forth to man, the Testimony of Salvation; bound up, and sealed, where <HI>Jesus</HI> is Alpha and Omega. This Spirit, insinuates that the Doctrine which treats of the person of <HI>Christ,</HI> of His Life, Sufferings, Death, and Resur∣rection; of our being justified and sanctified in Him; is a very <HI>Dangerous,</HI> if not a <HI>Diabolical</HI> Doctrine, and chiefly, because if it does not immediately <HI>oppose,</HI> it teaches to <HI>slight</HI> and <HI>dis∣regard</HI> the work of the Spirit upon the Heart: will not suffer men to look unto that quarter for comfort: will not admit of it as an evi∣dence for Heaven: nor suffer them from thence to exalt themselves above their Fellows: but will always be proposing <HI>Jesus</HI> as a salve for every sore, and a perfect redress of all grievances. Thus Antichrist accuses the Spi∣rit of Truth, (because he glorisies <HI>Christ,</HI>) of Heresy: in denying the work of the Spirit upon the Heart: and supported by Tradition, and its Cloud of witnesses, it storms so violently, prates and insinuates so successfully, that it hath almost jostled Christianity out of the World: and hath introduced instead thereof, gross Enthusiasm, Self-righteousness, Bigotry, and Superstition, amongst the more zealously religious part of Mankind, and amongst such who are <HI>less</HI> concerned, Deism; with all the pride of moral virtues. This is that Spirit which I set my Face against, and of which I speak, wherever I have through my Book, ranked this phrase, <HI>the work of the Spirit upon the Heart,</HI> amongst the cant terms of Judaism blended with Heathenism.</P></NOTE> <PB N="138" REF="046269_0171_10211797078913C0"/>of human Goodness, moral Virtue, and exclaim against Sin and Sinners: I say, if men have but those appearances, they are <PB N="139" REF="046269_0172_1021179BDF54B8B0"/>according to the principle of the false <HI>Christ,</HI> to be deemed devout, and pious Christians; though they speak in the most irreverent terms of the person of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and scandalize the Doctrine of Salvation alone by his Blood; ridicule his mysteries as whimsies; and with the old Pharisees, accuse him as the Ring leader of the Wick∣ed, and the Cause of the Prophaneness which is in the world. And so zealous are mankind become for <HI>this</HI> Holiness, or <HI>Christ,</HI> as it is promiscuously called, that such who are considered as Gospel Mini∣sters, will not <HI>now</HI> grant any thing far∣ther concerning <HI>Jesus of Nazareth,</HI> than what they think tends to promote this holiness, or inward <HI>Christ:</HI> Thus is <HI>this</HI> made the grand Criterion whereby to <PB N="140" REF="046269_0173_102117A04C23AE68"/>judge of all Truth: It being <HI>now</HI> common to inquire upon any proposition concern∣ing <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> doth it tend to promote inward Holiness, and true Heart-work? If it <HI>does,</HI> receive it; if it does <HI>not,</HI> reject it; let it be what it will. From hence it is evident, that this Holiness <HI>within them,</HI> hath infinitely the Preference before the Person of <HI>Christ,</HI> since He shall not be allowed to plead his own Cause, where there is the least Suspicion of his Doctrine clashing with their Conceptions of in∣ward Holiness, or <HI>Christ</HI> in them: Like the Martyr <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Antagonists, they will then put their Fingers in their Ears, and run down his Testimony with Noise and Tumult. But, if the least Sparkle of this <HI>inward Heliness</HI> or <HI>Christ</HI> be seen, or in short, if there be nothing of this na∣ture seen, provided there is a good will towards it, a hearty zeal and stickling for it, let it be (as before hinted) under what∣soever name it may, whether Morality, Virtue, Piety, Holiness, the Work of the Spirit upon the Heart, or <HI>Christ within;</HI> I say, towards all such in whom any Thing of this Nature can be seen, or if they are but <HI>contentious</HI> for it; they have the most enlarged Bowels and extensive <PB N="141" REF="046269_0174_102117A1D58FBEB0"/>Charity. Towards all such, they are ex∣ceedingly prodigal of their Favours; in∣somuch, that whether they desire it or not; yea, whether they will accept it or not, they will Christian them: Yea, if a <HI>Jew,</HI> a <HI>Mchometan,</HI> a <HI>Deist,</HI> or an <HI>Atheist,</HI> be according to the Phrase, a good Man, a holy Liver, he must be supposed to have an interest in <HI>Christ,</HI> not withstand∣ing he do not believe in him, but rather reviles him; and whoever questions it, will be deemed a very uncharitable and censorious Bigot. On the other Hand, if a Man hath a Sinner Character, makes no pretensions to inward Holiness, is not contentious, or noisy about it; though he may believe in <HI>Christ,</HI> venerate him, have all his hope and dependance for Salvation upon his Death and Blood: I say, a Man of this Character stands no Chance: it would be reckoned credulous, yea, the greatest abuse of Charity, to christian such a Man, or to conclude him interested in <HI>Christ.</HI> From this Doctrine, those infe∣rences naturally arise: A <HI>Jew,</HI> a <HI>Pagan,</HI> a <HI>Turk,</HI> a <HI>Deist,</HI> or <HI>Atheist,</HI> if good and vir∣tuous, according to the before-mentioned Goodness, is preferable to the most zea∣lous worshipper of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and believer in <PB N="142" REF="046269_0175_102117A4C714C268"/>him, if <HI>imperfect</HI> and <HI>sinful.</HI> Again, Good∣ness and Holiness in Man, by whatever <HI>Name</HI> it is called, more infallibly demon∣strates the accepted of God, the person with whom he is pleased; than <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> his Death and Resurrection, or any confidence or trust in him: consequent∣ly, this Virtue, this Holiness, this inward Work, is preferable to the Person, the Life, Death, and Resurrection of <HI>Jesus of Nazareth.</HI> To be able to draw those in∣ferences from the principles of <HI>Free∣thinkers, Socinians</HI> and <HI>Arians,</HI> would not at all surprize; but to see them naturally rise, from the Doctrines of such, who would be contradistinguished from the former, and considered as Preachers of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> may possibly surprize some, who have been used to say unto the work of their own hands, <HI>Ye are our Gods.</HI></P>
<P>We need go no farther than those false Testimonies, to find the false <HI>Christs;</HI> nor than such who <HI>vend</HI> them, to find the false <HI>Prophets.</HI></P>

If we consider the <HI>Bible-saints</HI> and their Excellencies, in a figurative light, as I have already hinted; our <HI>Jesus</HI> will appear the Hero of the Scriptures: Or, if we respect them as being really in <HI>Christ,</HI> what they are characterized in the Letter, (for it is easily proved that they were not so in themselves) He still hath the pre-emi∣nence in all things, and every beautiful character given unto man in the scrip∣tures, is primarily His: as the substance of the shadow, or as the <HI>Head,</HI> who by Union with the <HI>Body,</HI> blesses all the Mem∣bers with his own condition and charac∣ter: Whilst they, <HI>above all things</HI> rejoice in his Beauty, Power and Excellencies. That one thing so greatly desired by the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> is granted unto all who discern their <HI>Union</HI> with the head, namely, <HI>To dwell in the House of the Lord for ever, to behold his Beauty, and to enquire in his Temple.</HI> Though the consideration of such a glorious Salvation in <HI>Jesus,</HI> is infinitely refreshing and delightful, yet is there a higher Felicity, consisting in the clear views of his personal Beauties and Glo∣ries. Thus the <HI>Elders</HI> who surround his Throne, though perfected in his Like∣ness, wearing Crowns of Glory, Palms of <PB N="144" REF="046269_0177_102117AB5D00E570"/>Victory, cast all their Honours, and them∣selves likewise, before his Feet; prostrat∣ing, and singing incessantly, Worthy is the Lamb: thereby intimating, that his personal Worth, Dignity and Beauty, as beheld by them, is their highest Heaven, their sublimest consolation. For this the Saviour prayed, <HI>Father I will that they whom thou hast given me, may be with me where I am, that they may behold my Glory.</HI> Unto the Eye of Sense, there was neither Form nor Comeliness; whereby Men should desire him, when in the Day of his Hu∣miliation his Judgment was taken away: when his Face being more marr'd than any Man's, and his Form more than the Sons of Men, He was press'd with our Sicknesses, Sins and Sorrows: Then, he appeared like the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> of old, (as covered with Badger Skins) mean and contemptible, unto all such as judged ac∣cording to Appearance: But unto those who conceived aright of his Beauty and Glory, even <HI>then,</HI> his Form was most ex∣cellent and his Comeliness perfect, the fairest of the Sons of Men, Grace and Truth was poured into his Lips. My Beloved, (faith the Spouse) is white and ruddy, the chief amongst Ten Thousand, <PB N="145" REF="046269_0178_102117AECCFD39D0"/>Yea, he is made the central Point of all Beauties and Excellencies, as when thus described: <HI>His Head is as the most fine Gold, his Locks are Bushy, and black as a Raven; his Eyes are as the Eyes of Doves by the Rivers of Waters, washed with Milk, and fitly set. His Cheeks are as a Bed of Spices, as sweet Flowers. His Lips like Lillies, dropping sweet smelling Myrrk. His Hands are as Gold Rings set with the Beryl. His Belly is as bright Ivory, over∣laid with Sapphires. His Legs are as Pil∣lars of Marble, set upon Socke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of fine Gold. His Countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the Cedars. His Mouth is most sweet, yea he is altogether lovely.</HI> Thus Gold, pre∣cious Stones, Ivory, Marble, Spices, Flow∣ers, Trees, Mountains, Rivers, Gums, Birds, &amp;c. are here collected, to form a Composition of Beauties figurative of him. Yea whatsoever is seen in all the Creation of God, all the Excellencies and Beauties, whether they are Glories <HI>Terrestrial,</HI> or <HI>Gelestial,</HI> are Figures of him: All trans∣mitting their Lustre to him, all pointing to him as their Perfection, and He whose Glory and Honour was the ultimate End of their Creation: <HI>All things were created by him, and for him,</HI> faith the Spirit. <PB N="146" REF="046269_0179_102117B05861C2A0"/>His Beauties of Holiness, how inexplica∣ble! How divine! <HI>Pure,</HI> without <HI>Auste∣rity; Wise,</HI> without <HI>Vanity; Humble,</HI> without <HI>Pride; Self-denying,</HI> without <HI>Self∣love</HI>; Holy, Harmless, Undefiled; <HI>Purer</HI> than the <HI>Heavens</HI>; Holier than the <HI>Angels,</HI> He only is Holy; He only is the Lord: Such was his Self-denial, that though he was rich, yet he became poor. Though all Honour, Power and Glory, was origi∣nally his; his name, and character, the most exalted; yea, tho' without robbery he was equal to the most High, yet <HI>he took upon him the form of a servant, and made himself of no reputation.</HI> Whilst the Foxes had Holes, and the Birds of the Air had Nests, the Son of Man had no where to lay his Head! As a Stranger and Pilgrim, he passed through the Worlds which his own Hands had made, and unfeignedly felt the want of such necessaries and refreshments, which the <HI>Creatures</HI> from <HI>Man</HI> to the <HI>Reptile,</HI> yea even to the smallest <HI>Insect,</HI> thro' his Providence, were abundantly supplied with. In all this, he sought not himself, but through <HI>all,</HI> his unchangeable Motto was, <HI>Not my Will, but Thine be done:</HI> it being his Meat and his Drink to do the <PB N="147" REF="046269_0180_102117B5ADC1F958"/>Father's Will. Such was his Self-denial, that tho' he was <HI>that Just one</HI>; in his own individual self, was Holy, Harmless, Undefiled, separate from Sinners, made higher than the Heavens; yet was he content to be numbered amongst the Transgressors; and to be accounted Sedi∣tious, a Rebel, a Glutton, a Wine-bibber, a Blasphemer, a Deceiver, a Demoniack, an Encourager and Ringleader of the most notorious Sinners: Unto those ac∣cusations, he replied not; but by his <HI>silence</HI> denying his holy character, he seemingly acknowledged the Charge exhibited against him,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though as an Individual he was perfectly holy; and the charge of sin brought against him by his enemies, as false as Satan: Yet as the Head and Representative of the people, as personating the sinner, he confessed the charge by his si∣lence: otherwise it does not appear, wherefore he was silent; when the cause of truth called upon him to make his defence. That his great and unparallel'd humility was evident in this transaction, does not prove that his behaviour in this particular, was calculated <HI>only</HI> to exhibit that beauty. Therefore may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e construe his silence, a tacit acknowledgement of his being <HI>made sin for us.</HI></NOTE> and submitting to the punishment, was content to make his Grave with the Wicked. He denied <PB N="148" REF="046269_0181_102117B8D2538358"/>himself <HI>so far,</HI> as to permit Satan, (a crea∣ture of his power, and one whom he had before crushed to everlasting Darkness for his rebellion) to tempt him: and that with the glories of a world, which he himself had made, and which at that time, he upheld by the right hand of his power: <HI>All</HI> living, moving, existing in him, and governed by his providence: And also with worshipping <HI>him,</HI> who was not only his <HI>Creature,</HI> but a creature <HI>fallen</HI> and <HI>accursed,</HI> and whose very <HI>being,</HI> was enmity against him. Yea, he suffered the Tempter to sift him like wheat; to rush upon him with all his policy and power, by every Gate of Hell; to try him with Despair, Presumption, Self∣murther, and with an inordinate love of Life; by using the most extravagant means for the preservation thereof: yea even to hazard his knowledge of him self, of his own Dignity and Glory, as the Son of God, upon the success thereof.</P>
<P>Thus seeking, if by any means he might oblige him to deviate from his own Law, and rule of righteousness, writ∣ten by <HI>Moses,</HI> and the Prophets. How beautiful his humility! he patiently <PB N="149" REF="046269_0182_102117BBF7F92D88"/>endured the contradiction of Sinners against himself. How conspicuous his love, through the things which he suf∣fered! many Waters could not quench it, neither could the Floods drown it. His meekness! how apparent, when as a Lamb led to the slaughter, and as a Sheep before her shearers Dumb, he opened not his Mouth: when he was reviled, he reviled not again, nor did he hide his face from shame and spitting, but calmly gave his Back to the smiters, and his Cheeks, to them who plucked off the Hair. These, and every other Godlike dispo∣sition and perfection, shining in Him, through his Life and Death, renders him at <HI>once</HI> the object of wonder, delight and pleasure. Yea, such is his superlative beauty, that when we have considered all excellencies in Heaven and Earth with the utmost eaxctness and impar∣tiality, we are <HI>still</HI> with relation to them all, constrained to cry, <HI>as the Apple-Tree is among the Trees of the Wood, so is my Beloved among the Sons.</HI> Surprizingly rare! one amongst thousands, yea, only one in all the wood: distinguished from <HI>all</HI> in fragrance, fruit, and shade. Well may every admiring worshipper say, <HI>I sat</HI> <PB N="150" REF="046269_0183_102117BF0EE6E548"/><HI>down under his shadow with great delight; and his Fruit was sweet to my taste.</HI></P>
<P>He is beautiful in the majesty of his power, and the glory of his kingdom. All power in Heaven and in Earth is given into his Hand. By him Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice. The Queen of Sheba came from the uttermost parts of the Earth to hear the Wisdom of <HI>Solomon,</HI> and to see his Glory, (but behold a great∣er than <HI>Solomon</HI> is here.) And <HI>when she saw his Wisdom, and the House that he had built, and the Meat of his Table, and the sitting of his Servants, and the attendance of his Ministers, and their apparel, and his Cup-bearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the House of the Lord, there was no more Spirit in her.</HI></P>
<P>We also, when we come up to Zion, to see the King in his beauty, with the Queen standing on his right-hand, shi∣ning in Gold of <HI>Ophir;</HI> are equally sur∣prized, astonished and smitten with won∣der: How glorious the displays of his Wisdom! In Creation, Redemption and Providence; especially in that admira∣ble oeconomy with which he governs his <PB N="151" REF="046269_0184_102117C1EF102C08"/>own House: There he shews the beau∣ties of <HI>Holiness.</HI> Holiness for ever be∣cometh his House, and reverence his Saints. Of <HI>Experience</HI> having been tempted in every point, like unto us. Of <HI>Compassion,</HI> he has compassion on the Ignorant, and such as are out of the way. Of <HI>Sympathy,</HI> he is touched with the feel∣ing of our Infirmities. His Wisdom, Love and Power, in guiding, protecting, enriching and causing all things to work together for the good of them who love him, and are the called according to his purpose, is most beautifully seen here: The <HI>House which he hath built,</HI> where through the labours of his Life and Death, he hath built us <HI>in himself</HI> an habitation for God, through the Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>The Meat of his Table,</HI> his <HI>Flesh is Meat indeed;</HI> his <HI>Blood</HI> is <HI>Drink indeed:</HI> by Union with which, we are fed with all his grace and fruits. <HI>The sitting of his Servant,</HI> the Rest that remaineth for the People of God, which rest is in him, where all those who believe <HI>entering</HI> cease from their own Works, as God ceased from his. <HI>The standing of his Ministers,</HI> their continual readiness to execute his Will; <PB N="152" REF="046269_0185_102117C51A3532B0"/>and with unwearied pleasure and delight, to bear his message to his Church: He maketh his Ministers a flame of Fire, administering by the word of his Cross, Light and Heat all around them. <HI>Ap∣parallelled</HI> with <HI>him</HI> who is the righte∣ousness of the Saints, they bear witness of <HI>his</HI> Royalties, Majesty and Glory: as the <HI>King of Kings and Lord of Lords.</HI></P>
<P><HI>His Cup-bearers,</HI> those who offer ever∣lasting praise, resulting from his Blood and Death; which as the Juice of the true Vine, the fruit of <HI>his own</HI> doings and sufferings, he drinks for ever new in the Kingdom of the Father. <HI>His ascent unto the House of the Lord,</HI> the Union of na∣tures in his person; by which the Man in him, is one with God: and therefore, goes up unto the House of the Lord.</P>
<P>When the Queen of Sheba saw this, <HI>only in the figure,</HI> there was no more Spi∣rit in her: but breaking forth in strains of ecstacy, it exceedeth, said she, <HI>the fame which I heard, the half was not told me, happy thy men, happy these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, that hear thy wisdom, blessed be the Lord thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on <PB N="153" REF="046269_0186_102117C6A30B5BF8"/>the Throne of Israel; because the Lord loved Israel forever, therefore made he thee King, to do Judgment and Justice.</HI></P>
<P>What then must be the strains, when our greater <HI>Solomon,</HI> in all his Wisdom, Majesty, Beauty, and glory is seen. Such is the poverty of speech, yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the most <HI>expressive</HI> words; that we are utterly inca∣pable of declaring, what we then conceive of his eternal excellency. Whilst our utmost conceptions, bear no proportion to his real glories, his transcendent beau∣ties: but are, as a moment of time to eternity. Thousands of thousand mini∣ster unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand, stand before him: let us mingle with the multitude, thus blest with his presence; saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the <HI>Lamb</HI> that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing: and with every creature, which is in Heaven, and on the Earth, and under the Earth: and such as are in the Sea, and all that are in them, say∣ing, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, unto him that sitteth upon the Throne, and unto the <HI>Lamb</HI> for ever, and ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A SUPPLEMENT UNTO THE FOREGOING TREATISE ON THE DOCTRINE OF UNION: EXHIBITING A SPECIMEN OF APOSTOLIC PREACHING.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of the Apostles Preaching, appears, when among Jews and Gentiles, they taught that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> was the Messiah, the Son of God; and that he was crucified unto Death, and on the third Day rose again from the Dead, for the Forgiveness of Sins, and the Justification of Mankind. And this they proved from the pre∣dictions of the Prophets, from the pattern shewn unto <HI>Moses</HI> in the Mount, and by undoubted miracles wrought in the Name of that Jesus whom they Preached. All who believed their Testimony, were there∣by sensible of Salvation: there were no such doubts as these amongst them then, viz. How do I know whether he died for me, or whether I am particularly interest∣ed in him, &amp;c. Those queries and criti∣cisms, are of later date than the Aposto∣lic Age: and owe their existence unto the wisdom of this world, which in the decline of true Christianity, took place of <PB N="155" REF="046269_0188_102117D09CE650C0"/>that primitive simplicity, with which the first Preachers of <HI>Jesus</HI> bare witness of Him. They had their rise from the distinctions made amongst men: of Pre∣destinate, and Reprobate, as unqualified, for the Grace of the Gospel: of Fruit∣ful, as having a <HI>right</HI> to believe their personal interest in <HI>Christ</HI>: or unfruitful, whose interest in him is doubtful. Those distinctions once concluded upon, be∣tween self-righteousness, and ignorance of the scriptures; have, from generation to generation, been carefully handed down: Whilst all the World assented to them, as traditions of gracious Men, taking it for granted, without <HI>impartial</HI> inquiry, that they were deducible from scripture.</P>
<P>This, by degrees, rendered the things belonging to our peace so intricate, that the knowledge thereof was considered as wholly confined to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ools. And <HI>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce</HI> it was, that when a Man believed the Gospel report concerr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> Namely that he was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God, the Saviour of the World, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be died, and rose again for our Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say, when a man had believed this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et taught to inquire, how do I know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <PB N="156" REF="046269_0189_102117D225563270"/>he died for me? whether I am interested in him or not? was I sure says one, that I am predestinate, I could be easy: says another was I but sufficiently convinced, and humbled, I could believe that <HI>Christ</HI> died for me: says a third, could I but perceive the fruits of the Spirit <HI>in me,</HI> the proper effects and obedience of Faith, <HI>I</HI> could be assured of <HI>my</HI> interest in him.</P>
<P>Thus are mankind taught to establish their own righteousness: where, upon the authority of some goodness wrought <HI>by</HI> them, or found <HI>in</HI> them, they are di∣rected to conclude of the love of God to∣wards them, and of their personal inte∣rest in <HI>Christ.</HI> But what shall that man do, who is assured that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil continually,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. vi. 5.</NOTE> whose goodness is as a morning cloud; and as the early dew it goeth away,
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hos. vi. 10.</NOTE> and that he is as an un∣clean thing, and all his righteousness
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. ixiv. 6.</NOTE> as filthy rags? I say, What shall the man do, who by deep experience, every day and hour is sensible of those awful Truths, and knows them applicable to every child of Man? Who has a continual sense of <PB N="157" REF="046269_0190_102117D3B847D258"/>his Poverty, Misery, Blindness and Na∣kedness According to the forementioned tradition he must despair and be damned accordingly: for those Traditions say, it will avail him nothing to believe all that the Bible reports of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> if he has not good Works, good Fruits in himself, as more corroborating Evidences, more infallible Recommendations unto God, yea, as more undeniable marks of his acceptance with <HI>him</HI> than <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> than <HI>his</HI> Birth, Life, Sufferings, Death, Resurrection and Ascension. Let us only compare those conclusions with the Scriptures, and we shall quickly perceive them to be the very sinews of Antichrist.</P>
<P>The Apostle says, <HI>It is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 15.</NOTE> But Antichrist says, You cannot be saved, except you are holy and good in yourself; nor shall the Death and Resurrection of <HI>Jesus</HI> profit you, except you are changed and made fruitful in all good Works, Words and Thoughts. The Scripture saith, <HI>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that</HI> <PB N="158" REF="046269_0191_102117D54776BC70"/><HI>Justifieth the Ungodly, his Faith is counted for Righteousness.</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 5.</NOTE> But Antichrist saith, That <HI>Christ</HI> doth not Justify the Ungodly; and that he Justifies only such who are Godly: who are repentant, humble, meek, loving righteousness, and hating iniquity. And where the fore-cited text shews us, that <HI>Christ's Faith</HI> is accounted for Righteousness, to all such who work∣ing not, believeth on him, as Justifying the Ungodly: Antichrist says, You are Justified by <HI>your own Faith,</HI> which will produce Righteousness in you, to evi∣dence it. The Scriptures say, That <HI>while we were yet sinners Christ died for us,</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. v.8.</NOTE> <HI>and that when we were Enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son;</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">‖ Ver. 10.</NOTE> <HI>and that God was in Christ reconciling the World unto himself, not impating their Trespasses unto them.</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">§ Cor. v. 19.</NOTE> But Antichrist saith, <HI>sinners</HI> have no right to conclude that <HI>Christ</HI> died for them: that such who have this right are distinguished from <HI>sinners,</HI> by inherent holiness, and gracious quali∣ties. And it farther saith, in contradic∣tion to <HI>Christ,</HI> that he did not reconcile us to God, when we were <HI>enemies</HI> but that <PB N="159" REF="046269_0192_102117D8B4239860"/>we must love him, fear him, and serve him before we can be said to be reconciled to him: and as to man's being reconciled by the Death of <HI>Jesus,</HI> it absolutely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies that; and says, we are reconciled by being reformed, changed, and made conformable in heart and practice to God; and that until then, it is not true that God hath reconciled us unto himself in <HI>Christ,</HI> not∣withstanding the Apostle saith it. The scriptures say, that <HI>we are saved by the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ</HI>;
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xv. 11.</NOTE> yea expressly, <HI>by Grace are ye saved.</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 8.</NOTE> But Antichrist says, there are <HI>Terms</HI> and <HI>Conditions</HI> to be complied with and ful∣filled, before you can be saved. The Apostle saith, that God hath <HI>given to us eternal Life, and that this Life is in his Son: and that he who believeth not this record, hath made God a Liar.</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John v. 10, 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>From whence it is plain, that he who believeth not, hath eternal life given him in the Son of God, as fully as him who believeth: else it doth not appear how he could make God a liar, by not believing; nor, how the unbeliever can be <HI>censured</HI> for <PB N="160" REF="046269_0193_102117DE8C48FD30"/>not believing what was not true. But Antichrist says, all have not a right to believe: some because they are not pre∣destinate, others because not qualified, by repentance, &amp;c. others tho' they have be∣lieved, have no right to be assured, because they are not sufficiently fruitful: Therefore those cannot make God a Liar, when they believe not, it being not required of them to believe a falshood. Our Saviour cen∣sured such who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: But Antichrist supports this character, and is constantly for distinguishing, be∣tween <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Sinners,</HI> and that not from any rejoicing in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> which one hath above the other, but from the <HI>Saints</HI> being more righteous, than the <HI>Sinners,</HI> more holy, devout, and wise. Our Sa∣viour reproved the church of <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> in the sharpest manner, for growing rich, and increasing in goods, for not retaining a just sense of her poverty, misery, blindness, and nakedness: But Antichrist says, you <HI>must</HI> increase in goods, you <HI>must</HI> grow rich, rich in Wisdom, Knowledge, Holiness, Goodness, Virtue, and Experience: and except you thus increase in Goods, <HI>Christ</HI> shall profit you nothing. You was poor, <PB N="161" REF="046269_0194_102117E0423B1B20"/>and miserable, and blind, and naked, says Antichrist; but not so <HI>now,</HI> you are <HI>con∣verted,</HI> you are <HI>born again,</HI> you are <HI>chang∣ed,</HI> therefore how should you know your∣self to be what you are not, <HI>now</HI> however, whatever you <HI>have</HI> been? The spirit of Truth says, <HI>Christ is made of God unto us Wisdom, Right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Sandification, and Redemption.</HI> Yea saith Antichrist, but except you are made this in <HI>Yourselves,</HI> you cannot be saved. Thus the Traditions of Man, make void the word of God; and thus Antichrist warreth against <HI>Jesus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Mary.</HI> This is that Anti∣christ, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of, and who made as appearance, as early as the days of the Apostles. He mined the Labours of <HI>Paul,</HI> in <HI>Galatia,</HI> and made him complain that all they who were in <HI>Asia,</HI> were turned away from him: inso∣much that this Apostle, laborious, and zealous for the Glory of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> lived to see sundry of the Churches, whom he had espoused to one husband, as a chaste Virgin to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> overrun and spoiled by Antichrist. And indeed this and what followed was foretold by him, in his Epistle to the <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> where he said, The day of <HI>Christ</HI> should not come, <PB N="162" REF="046269_0195_102117E331C01D50"/><HI>except there come a falling away first, and that Man of sin be revealed, the son of Perdition, who opposeth and exalteth him∣self above all that is called God, or that is worshipped: so that he as God, sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.</HI> It is easily seen, that this pre∣diction is fulfilled. <HI>John</HI> also said, that Antichrist was in the world <HI>then,</HI> denying that <HI>Jesus</HI> was come in the flesh: or, as it signifies, that he had finished the re∣demption of Mankind; and consequently taught Men to look for him <HI>yet</HI> to come in <HI>their Flesh:</HI> under the notion of Light, Power, Wisdom, Faithfulness, Humility, Love, &amp;c. From the appearing of this Antichrist in the world, we may date the AEra of the Apostacy, or falling away from the Apostles Doctrine; when Mankind began to entangle each other with their own Inventions. The Apostles, as I have hinted, preached the Person of <HI>Christ,</HI> the simple facts of his Death and Resur∣rection, as Justification and Forgiveness of Sins to the Children of <HI>Adam.</HI> It was enough that their hearers believed their report of the crucified One: and as I ob∣served before, the persons thus believing, never once questioned but it was for them, <PB N="163" REF="046269_0196_102117E636147798"/>because hitherto they had not been taught that <HI>any</HI> were excluded from it. Anti∣christ had not as yet the <HI>boldness</HI> to affirm, that there were some amongst Mankind, who though they heard of the Death and Resurrection of the Lord <HI>Jesus,</HI> yea, though they believed it, yet had no right to conclude it was for them. Nor had he as yet, propagated that subtil distinc∣tion, between the belief of the Truth, and the knowledge of their personal interest therein. For in those days of undisguised truth &amp; simplicity, when any man believed the Testimony of the Apostles concerning <HI>Jesus,</HI> his heart exulted in the Truth, no∣thing doubtful of his interest therein. The <HI>belief of the Truth,</HI> and the <HI>purged conscience,</HI> were then inseparable. For the Testimony is, not only that <HI>Christ</HI> died and rose again, such as we might hear of some other Person, as <HI>Lazarus:</HI> but the <HI>truth</HI> is, that he died for our Sins, and rose again for our Justification: insomuch that believing the truth, necessarily im∣plies the knowledge of our personal inte∣rest in <HI>Christ,</HI> the latter is always in pro∣portion to the former. To distinguish between the belief of the Truth, and the knowledge of our <HI>interest</HI> therein, is the <PB N="164" REF="046269_0197_102117E7C17E2808"/>invention of a Spirit, who professing Christianity, would not be thought to be an unbeliever, but at the same time, hav∣ing not the testimony of a <HI>good conscience,</HI> the <HI>inward witness,</HI> which the scriptures affirm to be the case with such who be∣lieve: but full retaining a <HI>conscience of sin,</HI> he was obliged to scheme this dis∣tinction; to keep up his credit as a be∣liever, but such a one as was doubtful of his personal interest in the truth believed. Yea, and to ward off all censure on this account, this doubtfulness must be nou∣rished and cherished, and strongly recom∣mended to others, as prudent religious fear; from which we are very rarely to be delivered; and that only in proportion to our <HI>fruitfulness,</HI> as the effects of the Truth believed. And to make this the more plausible, it is insinuated that the greatest danger lies on the side of a con∣sident believing; signifying, that men are rather damned for believing (which is called presuming) than for doubting; thus from every quarter, Antichrist aims by his Traditions, at making void the Word of God. It is very surprizing to observe, after a person hath made a great bustle about <HI>Christ,</HI> and raised a dust, by <PB N="165" REF="046269_0198_102117EAE1638028"/>proposing a Truth to be believed, unclog∣ed with any conditions whatsoever in the person believing; requiring no other qua∣lification in him, than what is naturally common to mankind; and that the truth which is thus to be believed, is none other than the simple fact of <HI>Christ's</HI> Death and Resurrection: I say, after proposing this, and quarreling with all the world about it, giving the hardest names, even unto such, who only differed unhappily in the Mode of Expression: To find <HI>such a one</HI> sink to this, that a man may believe the forecited truth, and not know his inte∣rest in it; yea, have no interest at all in it; and that such who <HI>have</HI> can only know it by their fruits, gives as a striking prospect of Antichristian policy, and makes us suspect the intention, where it is proposed to exalt Christ alone. The Scriptures assure us that Mankind as Sin∣ners, are interested in the Death and Re∣surrection of <HI>Christ</HI>: Therefore to ap∣prehend and believe that Truth <HI>properly,</HI> is to believe our personal interest in him. If it should be objected, that Christ doth not now say to any individual, thy sins are forgiven thee; I answer, he doth: for what he said unto <HI>one,</HI> he saith unto <PB N="166" REF="046269_0199_102117EF6420BFB0"/><HI>every one</HI> who believeth it: otherwise, we may say there is nothing in the Scriptures said unto us; the Old Testament being written unto the <HI>Jews</HI>; the New-Testa∣ment, some to one Church and some to another, but none to us: If we have not a right to believe that what <HI>Christ</HI> said unto them, he said unto us; but, that we can only know our interest in <HI>Christ</HI> by our fruits; is first a denial of the wit∣ness of the spirit; except it is supposed that he bears witness by those things, and not by <HI>Christ</HI>: which by the way, is to speak of himself, &amp; prove himself a Spirit of Error. Again, it is to make our goodness essen∣tial to the knowledge of our Salvation, which is a manifest going about to estab∣lish our own righteousness, as the <HI>medium at least</HI> whereby we believe; and a con∣tradiction to the Scripture; which saith, <HI>To him who worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the Ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</HI> Again, it makes void the law: by not adhering to its determination, concerning good and evil: for were we always to determine of our good and evil by the perfect law, it would be much more easy, with the great∣est pretender to piety, to <HI>number</HI> his good <PB N="167" REF="046269_0200_102117F48488DBB0"/>fruits, than it is to <HI>find</HI> them. Was <HI>this</HI> but truly considered amongst mankind, we should not have such proud boastings, and pretensions to know <HI>this,</HI> and the <HI>o∣ther</HI> matter, by their good works, and holy fruits, as we <HI>have</HI> in the world. I might say, it smells much stronger of the Church of Rome, (if it does not look a little to∣wards Deism) than of the Protestant Faith; but as that would be saying no∣thing, to such who think the Romish Faith true, and the Protestant wrong; I shall content myself with saying, that it is a flat contradiction of the Apostles Testi∣mony, as I have in part, and shall yet fur∣ther shew; though it would fain shelter itself under their Authority. Where those, and the like Suggestions of Anti∣christ take place in any Heart, the Con∣sequences are shocking; as to such who are <HI>vain</HI> enough to imagine themselves fruitful in <HI>themselves,</HI> and from thence to draw conclusions; as they must first make to themselves a new Law, before they can thus think: so must they of necessity be puffed up, and come into the character of the self-righteous. And, as to such who are not sufficiently vain, to think themselves thus fruitful, as they cannot <PB N="168" REF="046269_0201_1020EFE657760EC8"/>know their interest in <HI>Christ,</HI> there re∣mains nought for them but misery and fear; though they have <HI>this</HI> consolation, to be taught that unbelief and gloom, is a much less dangerous state, than an unsha∣ken confidence. It is easily seen, that those propositions are calculated to mul∣tiply and increase the perplexities, doubts, and objections of Mankind, against the Gospel of Jesus: therefore is it, that we have many more of those in the world <HI>now,</HI> than in the first ages of Christianity.</P>
<P>The Apostles preached <HI>Jesus,</HI> and his Benefits, promiscuously to sinners, and did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reighten his Grace, by shewing that there were some who had no right to it; either from their being <HI>reprobated</HI> or from their being <HI>unqualified</HI>; but by Divine Authority, they preached the Gos∣pel to every Creature, and every Man who was a Sinner, yea whether he knew him∣self such or not, (for they spake of things as true with God, and not according to the conceptions of man) was sufficiently <HI>qualified,</HI> and had an indisputable right, to conclude the Saviour's Death, and Resurrection, <HI>his</HI> Justification unto Life. And this much is to be understood by the <PB N="169" REF="046269_0202_102117F95F7BEBD8"/>Apostles assertions, <HI>We preach Christ cru∣cified.</HI> And again, <HI>We preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord: And with great power, gave the Apostles witness of the Resur∣rection of the Lord Jesus; and great Grace was upon them all.</HI> And again, <HI>he preached unto them Jesus, and the Resurrection.</HI> Thus, the Apostles dwelt altogether upon the fact of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Death and Resurrection amongst <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Greeks,</HI> as the alone salvation of Mankind. And what <HI>Paul</HI> himself thought of it, is evident from that Heart exultation of his, <HI>Who is he that condemneth, it is Christ that died, yea rather that is risen again:</HI> Thus the re∣surrection of <HI>Jesus,</HI> without the conside∣ration of any other matter, in <HI>Heaven</HI> or in <HI>Earth,</HI> was the Joy of his Heart: Yea all his Hope, and all his Salvation. He shewed, that the fact of <HI>Christ</HI>'s resurrec∣tion, was his exemption from condemna∣tion: He viewed it, and rejoiced in it, as such. And without doubt, what he ap∣prehended to be Truth, he preached un∣to others, as he sought not himself, in the things which he spake: The Glory of the Lord <HI>Jesus,</HI> and the happiness of his fel∣low-creatures, being that which he had always in view, in preaching the Kingdom <PB N="170" REF="046269_0203_102117FCB19A16F0"/>of God. As to Mankind, the Apostles thought them sufficiently qualified, (as be∣ing all concluded under Sin) for the Grace which they preached. They were taught to drop all distinctions, and no longer to consider men as <HI>clean</HI> and <HI>unclean,</HI> as <HI>cho∣sen</HI> and <HI>rejected:</HI> For saith <HI>Peter,</HI> the Lord hath shewed me, that I should not call any Man <HI>common</HI> or <HI>unclean.</HI> This was not because mankind were reformed and better <HI>now,</HI> than when God taught the <HI>Jews</HI> to respect the <HI>Gentiles</HI> as common and unclean; which he did under the Law; where he forbid the <HI>Jews,</HI> to have any connection with the <HI>Gentiles</HI>; and, if it was not owing to any Change in the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that they were now received, and were no longer to be considered as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and <HI>unclean,</HI> The Query is, What was it owing to? I answer, it was unto the Death and Resurrection of <HI>Jesus</HI>; for it was there that God had cleansed them. Therefore was it, that when <HI>Peter</HI> refused to eat, in the Vition of the Sheet, saying, Nothing that was <HI>unclean,</HI> had at any time come into his mouth; He was answered, Call not thou that <HI>common</HI> and <HI>unclean</HI> which God hath cleansed. Thus was he taught, that mankind who in <HI>themselves</HI> <PB N="171" REF="046269_0204_102117FFA6BA17D0"/>were <HI>unclean,</HI> were cleansed of God in <HI>Christ Jesus</HI>: according to which <HI>cleansing,</HI> he was instructed to respect them; and that he ought not any more to call <HI>any Man uncommon or unclean.</HI> Therefore, it was the business of the Apostles, to tell the People what God had done for them: Namely, that he had loved them, and washed them from their sins, in his own Blood. Thus as to <HI>Matter,</HI> and <HI>Manner,</HI> did the first witnesses of <HI>Jesus</HI> preach his Salvation unto the Children of Men. For where they tell us, that they preached the Son of God; that they preached <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> the Lord, <HI>Christ</HI> crucified, &amp;c. with∣out meddling with the characters and conditions of those unto whom they preached, to point them out, as qualified or unqualified for the reception of the Truth. I say, this their Matter and Manner of Preaching, plainly shews, that they did not aim at making a schism in the Body, by dividing the Head and Mem∣bers, as having separate interests: But, they aimed at shewing that the interest of the Head, was that of the Members: therefore was it, that holding the Head, they constantly preached <HI>his</HI> Excellence, <HI>his</HI> Labours, Triumphs and Honours; that the people as his Members, hearing of it, <PB N="172" REF="046269_0205_10211802969520C0"/>might hear of their own salvation and grace; because, the glory which is given unto him, as the Head, he gives to us, as his Members. From this <HI>Union,</HI> it appears, that hearing and believing of <HI>Christ,</HI> according to the Apostles testimo∣ny, we hear and believe, what truly re∣lates unto ourselves. And thus did they, by preaching the Obedience, Death, Re∣surrection and Ascension of the Lord <HI>Jesus,</HI> preach the salvation of Mankind in him; thus lifting <HI>him</HI> up that he might draw all men unto him; and, that they might espouse the people unto this <HI>one</HI> Husband, as chaste virgins unto this <HI>Jesus,</HI> they were cautious of meddling with the Characters of their Hearers, as <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as Repentant or Unre∣pentant, lest by making a Distinction, those who thought themselves on the fa∣vorable side of the question, should be lifted up, and their minds be adulterated, and rendered unchaste to the Crucified one: Nay, they had always <HI>causticks</HI> at hand, for the proud Flesh of their Disci∣ples, wherever they saw it rising; and this they applied without fear, or hav∣ing the persons of men in respect, when∣ever they saw occasion. And how care∣ful <HI>Paul</HI> was in this particular, appears <PB N="173" REF="046269_0206_10211805DB76D2A0"/>from his reproving <HI>Peter,</HI> for giving the least occasion to the <HI>Jews</HI> to glory in the Flesh, and keep up a distinction, which God had before shewn him an end of; where he actually forbad him to call that common and unclean, which he had cleansed.</P>
<P>This is a short specimen of the Apos∣tles Matter and Manner of Preaching: and according to <HI>my</HI> Apprehension, it is obvious that they had the Union between <HI>Christ</HI> and the people in view, when they thus preached.</P>
<P>There are many who respect the Epistles, written by the Apostles to the Churches, as a pattern of their preach∣ing: but they are to consider, that there is a wide difference between private Letters, written unto such who already believed on the Lord <HI>Jesus,</HI> wherein there is promiscuously thrown out such hints, as were designed to establish their Faith, and form their Manners. I say, a real difference between those, and their man∣ner of preaching in publick, where having to do with the Multitude, their only subject was the Person, Death, and Resur∣rection of the Lord <HI>Jesus</HI>; of which their sermons recorded in the Acts of <PB N="174" REF="046269_0207_1021180A18911000"/>the Apostles are instances. But since then there has been a great <HI>falling away,</HI> and <HI>the man of sin is revealed.</HI> And, as it is more than probable that the Day of <HI>Christ</HI> is at hand, <HI>Antichrist</HI> hath great wrath, and strives to the utmost extent of his Power and Cunning, to hinder the revival of the Apostolic Testimony, and the rising of the witnesses. Sometimes he seeks to establish his own Maxims, under the popular names of Virtue, Benevolence, Repentance, Faith, Fruit∣fulness, &amp;c. Then he calumniates the Testimony of <HI>Jesus,</HI> giving it the most opprobrious characters, and mad with rage against all the witnesses thereof, breathes forth nothing but slaughter and threatnings. And many are they, whom he either prevails on to adopt his Maxims and become his willing disciples, or so intimidates with his Threatnings, that they dare not embrace the Truth, because of the certain reproach that follows. But let him rage, he has but a short time, ere the Lord <HI>shall consume him with the spirit of his mouth,</HI> and des∣troy him with the <HI>brightness of his coming</HI>: and then shall the witnesses who now lie slain in the streets of the great city, stand again upon their feet; and the ancient Testimony be revived.</P>
<P>Come quickly Lord <HI>Jesus</HI>: make no long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arrying, O my God.</P>
