<BIBL>EPHESIANS II. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>For by Grace are ye <HI>SAVED.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was the Privilege of <HI>Adam,</HI> immediately on his first Creation, to be placed in the de∣lightful <HI>Garden of Eden.</HI> No sooner did he receive his Existence, but he became an In∣habitant of <HI>Paradise.</HI> He entered into a World finish'd with the most exquisite Art, and fur∣nish'd with every Thing that could contribute to his Happiness.—But the Children of the <HI>second Adam,</HI> enter into Being in very diffe∣rent Circumstances: Our Natures are deeply corrupted, we inhabit a dark and disordered World, <HI>we are born to Trouble as the Sparks fly upward.</HI>—Even after we are in some Mea∣sure

recovered from the Ruins of the Apostacy, and re-admitted into the Family of Heaven, it is by slow Degrees that we attain to a State of Felicity and Glory. We must pass through a tedious Pilgrimage, before we arrive at our destin'd Home: We must endure many suffer∣ings upon Earth, before we enter into celestial Joy.</P>
<P>THIS is the Appointment of God, and found∣ed in the Nature of Men, for the best of Saints upon Earth, are <HI>sanctified but in part:</HI> Upon this Account their Happiness is far from com∣plete: These Tabernacles of Clay must suffer a Dissolution, before we shall be prepared for the Vision and Enjoyment of an holy God. When we take Farewel of Sin, we shall bid an eternal Adieu to Sorrow.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time, the most extensive Pro∣posals of Salvation are made to Mankind: Those who cordially accept of this Salvation, are made partakers of its important Blessings: These are the interesting Truths contain'd in that Passage of Scripture, which has now been read unto you, and which by <HI>Divine Permission,</HI> will be the Subject of several Discourses.— The Design of my present Discourse, is to explain the Nature of that Salvation which is revealed in the Gospel—and the whole will be comprehended under the following Heads.—</P>

<PB N="3" REF="013514_0006_0F90F5A4438A8A38"/>
<ITEM>THE Salvation revealed in the Gospel implies, that those who are made Par∣takers of it were in a State of Guilt and Misery.—</ITEM>
<ITEM>THEIR Recovery is begun in this Life.—</ITEM>
<ITEM>THEIR Happiness shall be compleated, in a future World.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST, It implies, that those who are made Partakers of this Salvation, were in a State of Guilt and Misery.</HEAD>
<P>TO save, in strict Propriety of Speech, is to rescue a Person from a Danger to which he is exposed; or deliver him from a Calamity in which he is involved —Upon this Account the Eternal SON OF GOD, when He appeared upon Earth in the <HI>Fashion of a Man,</HI> assumed the Character of a SAVIOUR—<HI>His Name was cal∣led</HI> JESUS, <HI>because He come to save His People from their Sins</HI> —He assures us the Design of his Mission, was, <HI>so seek and save them that were lost.</HI></P>
<P>ANGELS are perfectly happy, but never men∣tioned among the Number of the saved; be∣cause they never violated the Purity of their Nature, but always maintained their primitive Innocence. Adorned with the Robes of un∣stained Righteousness, they feel no Guilt, fear no
<PB N="4" REF="013514_0007_0F90F5A4B60DF788"/>
Danger; but taste unmingled Felicity and Joy. —But Man is fallen from his original Excel∣lence, and plunged into an Abyss of Misery. Having departed from God, he is deprived of the amiable Image of the Deity; and become a Prey to the most infamous Appetites. A deluded Understanding leads him into endless Mazes of Error and Folly: He pursues a va∣nishing Shadow, and despises the true Felicity of his Nature: Captivated with the Charms of Sense, he neglects the Purity and Perfection of his immortal Spirit: Dazzled with a gav Ap∣pearance, he follows every glittering Phantom: Corrupted in his moral Taste, he rushes into the Embraces of the most polluting Pleasures: Unmindful of his heavenly Birth, his Affections are chained down to the Enjoyments of this inferior Earth: Seduced by flattering Dreams, he sleeps on securely, till the Light of Eternity discovers the fatal Mistake—So strong is the Deception while Men remain under the Power of depraved Nature, that we imagine ourselves free, even when we are the most passive Slaves. We hug our Chains, as if they were the noblest Ornaments. With thoughtless Gaiety, we tread the beaten Road that leads to Death and Hell. —To finish our Unhappiness, our Maker is offended; <HI>his Wrath is revealed from Heaven against</HI> us; the Sentence of his righteous Law condemns us to eternal Death.—To what Sanctuary shall we fly in this lost and desperate State?—Can we bribe inexorable Justice—Can
<PB N="5" REF="013514_0008_0F90F5A62D08D6D0"/>
we resist an omnipotent Arm?—Can we be concealed from that Being whose all-penetrating Eyes survey all Nature with a single Glance? —Can we escape beyond the Bounds of his universal Empire?—Or can we support the Terrors of his avenging Wrath?—<HI>Who can thunder with an Arm like God?—Who can abide the Day of his Indignation?</HI>—Our Con∣sciences accuse us of innumerable Crimes; the Law pronounces it's awful Curses against every Transgressor: We live only to encrease the Number of our Offences, and die to become the Victims of divine Justice.</P>
<P>IN this melancholy Situation, a Reprieve must be acknowledged a Favor; a Mitigation of our Punishment an unmerited Mercy; but the glad Tidings of Deliverance, one would think, must be received with Transports of Gratitude.—To publish this Good News is the Design of the Gospel; and the whole Number of the saved attend to the consolatory Message with an humble Faith.—As a necessary Con∣sequence of this—</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SECONDLY, Their Recovery is begun in this Life.</HEAD>
<P>YE <HI>are saved,</HI> says <HI>St. Paul</HI> to the believing <HI>Ephesians.</HI> He speaks of their Salvation, not as a future Event, but as a present Privilege. He does not say, Ye shall be saved in the Hour
<PB N="6" REF="013514_0009_0F90F5A6EAEBF9E0"/>
of Death—in the Morning of the Resurrection —at the illustrious <HI>Day of the Restitution of all Things</HI>; but describes it as an Happiness, which in some good Degree, they then enjoyed.</P>
<P>BUT how can this be?—Do not true Be∣lievers inhabit a World of Sorrow? Are they not defiled with innumerable Corruptions? Is not Satan continually disturbing their Peace? Does not the World with it's treacherous Smiles, frequently betray Men into Sin? Do they not groan under the Burden of various Afflictions? Must they not submit to the Empire of Death? Are not their Bodies, the Workmanship of the Almighty, by an irrevo∣cable Decree, condemned to become the <HI>Food of Worms?</HI>—Are these the Advantages which the Son of God hath purchased for his favorite People?—Is this the Salvation described with such Pomp and Magnificence in the Gospel?—</P>
<P>I GRANT, my Brethren, upon Earth we do not receive our perfect Consummation in Bliss. This Event will not take Place till the Day of Christ's second Appearance, in the Glory and Grandeur of an incarnate God; in the Cha∣racter of Universal Judge of Angels and Men. —Then our adorable Redeemer will manifest the Fulness of his saving Power, compleat the Designs of his almighty Love, and establish his People in a State of immutable Felicity and Glory.—But, upon Earth, we receive the first
<PB N="7" REF="013514_0010_0F90F08EAF7DDA28"/>
Fruits of this joyful Harvest: We are favored with delightful Foretastes of those Rivers of transporting Pleasure, which flow in the Para∣dise above: We view at a Distance the immor∣tal Glories of that Kingdom, where the Saints <HI>shall live and reign with God forever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>THE faithful Disciples of Christ, were ap∣pointed to this Salvation, in the eternal Counsels of God. <HI>In the Fulness of Time.</HI> JESUS the Saviour paid the Price of their Redemption to <HI>the uttermost Farthing.</HI> By his all sufficient Merits, he purchased for them the Honor and Happiness of the Sons of God. As an Evi∣dence of this—He hath sent his Spirit into their Hearts; <HI>to turn them from Darkness to Light;</HI> from the Follies of Vice, to <HI>the Wisdom of the Just;</HI> from the Labyrinths of Error and Delu∣sion, to the Paths of Holiness and Happiness, —By this we know, <HI>that we are passed from Death unto Life</HI>—are united to the Son of God, and interested in his immaculate Righte∣ousness:—In consequence of this, we have now the <HI>Forgiveness of our Sins,</HI> and shall shortly <HI>receive an Inheritance among those that are sanctified.</HI> We are no more considered <HI>as Aliens and Strangers, but Fellow-Citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God.</HI></P>
<P>HOW divine a Change have these happy Souls experienced! Well may they rejoice in their inestimable Privileges. If we are of this
<PB N="8" REF="013514_0011_0F90F08F6D2F8140"/>
happy Number, Salvation is ours by an unfail∣ing Title; shortly we shall possess all it's exten∣sive Blessings. We need not tremble at the condemning Sentence of the Law, but may rejoice in the Hope of immortal Glory. Christ hath endured the Punishment due to our Crimes; and wrought out a perfect Righteous∣ness in the Character of our Surety. By this we are justified at the Tribunal of God, and declared Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven.— We shall be preserved from the World and it's deceitful Temptations. For the great <HI>Captain of our Salvation</HI> hath overcome this dangerous Enemy. He will preserve us from being fatally seduced by its Terrors or Allurements: Every Christian hath his <HI>Conversation in Heaven,</HI> while here upon Earth; and is every Day as∣piring after a more exact Conformity to the Maxims and Manners of that blessed World. —We shall not be destroyed by the prevalency of corrupted Nature: For an immortal Princi∣ple of Life <HI>hath quickned us who were dead in Trespasses and Sins:</HI> We have a divine Assu∣rance that <HI>Sin,</HI> the worst of Evils, <HI>shall no more have the Dominion over us.</HI> Under the Con∣duct of almighty Grace, it's Influence is con∣tinually diminishing; <HI>the Path of the Just, like the Morning Light, shineth more and more unto the perfect Day.</HI>—We shall be delivered from the Policy and Power of Satan, though described as <HI>a roaring Lion seeking whom he may devour.</HI> Our BLESSED LORD hath
<PB N="9" REF="013514_0012_0F90F09030359938"/>
triumphed over this inveterate Opposer of God and Goodness, and will not suffer him finally to prevail against those who are committed to his Care: He may disturb their Peace, by his malig∣nant Suggestions, but not destroy their Safety: He may tempt them by the most artful Methods, but shall not be able to reduce them to a Subjec∣tion to his detested Empire. They are under the Protection of One, who <HI>is able to save unto the uttermost,</HI> and may depend on his faithful Promise, that <HI>none shall pluck them out of his Hands.</HI>—We are indeed exposed to the Arrests of <HI>the King of Terrors,</HI> and must, at the ap∣pointed Time, enter the dark Dominions of the Grave. But fear not, O Christian! the divine Presence will irradiate your Passage through the gloomy Vale of Death: Guards of Angels will safely escort you through the Territories of the <HI>Prince of Darkness:</HI> The <HI>Lord of Life</HI> bears the Keys of the invisible World; and Death can't remove us beyond the Limits of his ex∣tensive Jurisdiction. It indeed closes our Eyes upon the Beauties of this material System, but introduces us to the unutterable Glories of Hea∣ven. It translates us from this obscure Corner of the Creation, to the Place of the Divine Resi∣dence, the Seat of his eternal Empire.—But the Illustration of this Point naturally falls under</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE THIRD Part of my Discourse, which is to shew that the Recovery of the People of God, which is begun in this Life, shall be completed in a future World.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="10" REF="013514_0013_0F90F5AA4F485A80"/>THE Argument of St. Paul is strictly just and must give full Conviction to every attentive Mind: He <HI>that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, shall he not with Him freely give us all Things.</HI> The Love of God, in delivering up his Son to Sufferings and Death, for miserable Mortals is one of the most astonishing Mysteries of Faith, and will be the perpetual Admiration of the sublime Intel∣ligences of Heaven. But when we are con∣vinced of this fundamental Truth by the divine Testimony, we may easily conceive that the most excellent Favors will be bestowed upon those, for whom he made so costly a Sacrifice.—Ac∣cordingly Christians are adorned with the most honorable Titles, invested with the most exten∣sive Privileges, and assured of complete and eternal Happiness.</P>
<P>BUT what is their Condition while they reside upon Earth?—Do they appear in the proper Dignity of <HI>the Sons of God?</HI>—in the ge∣nuine Character of those who are appointed to <HI>inherit all Things?</HI>—No—They are often de∣filed with Sin, disturbed with Fears, disfigured with Reproach, oppressed with a Variety of Temptations and Trials.—But the Hour of Darkness is short, very soon the heavenly Light will arise: The Night of Affliction will quickly come to an End and be succeeded with perpetual and unclouded Day. Then they shall be freed from every Sorrow, purified from every Blemish, and <HI>be made</HI> KINGS <HI>and</HI> PRIESTS <HI>unto God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="013514_0014_0F90F5AB6D9985E0"/>IN the present Dispensation; the Ways of Providence are mysterious; the Equity and Goodness of the divine Government is, in a great Measure, concealed from the most dili∣gent Enquirers: Vice often receives the Re∣wards of Virtue; and Virtue is condemned to the Punishment of Vice: JESUS CHRIST is confined to a Manger, an impious <HI>Herod</HI> is advanced to the Throne of <HI>Israel: St. Paul</HI> is a Prisoner in Chains, a bloody <HI>Nero</HI> sways the Scepter of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire: The best of Men are trampled under Foot as <HI>the Off-scouring of all Things;</HI> and the vilest Monsters of human Nature are attended with Applause, and <HI>ride upon the High Places of the Earth.</HI> —But in the Day of the Restitution of all Things, Vice shall appear in it's naked Defor∣mity, and be punished with righteous Severity: Virtue shall be publickly applauded at the su∣preme Tribunal. and receive a <HI>Crown of incor∣ruptible Glory:</HI> The laves of Satan shall be confined in <HI>Chains of everlasting Darkness</HI>— while the Servants of Christ shine <HI>as the Brightness of the Firmament forever.</HI></P>
<P>HOW poor and imperfect is the Happiness, which the Saints enjoy upon Earth, in com∣parison of the magnificent Promises which are made unto them in the Word of God!—In their best Estate—their happiest Hours—they are far from that Purity and Perfection, to which they ardently aspire. But the Day of
<PB N="12" REF="013514_0015_0F90F090EEC501D8"/>
their Redemption is swiftly approaching, when they shall awake, arrayed in the Redeemer's Righteousness, adorned with the Beauties of the divine Image, and receive the full Satisfac∣tion of all their Desires. The everlasting Love of God to his People, will appear in its richest Glory; and the Designs of redeeming Grace receive their final Accomplishment —Then we shall no longer prostrate ourselves before an <HI>invisible God,</HI> but approach the Throne of his Glory, behold His unveiled face, and triumph in the Joys of His immediate Presence.—We shall no longer worship Him in <HI>Temples made with Hands,</HI> in Company with sinful and miserable Mortals; but enter the undefiled <HI>Sanctuary above,</HI> and unite our Voices with <HI>Angels and Arch-Angels,</HI> in the triumphant <HI>Hallelujahs</HI> of Heaven.—We shall no longer be confined to a few refreshing Tastes of the divine Benignity, but have free Access to the <HI>Tree of Life, which stands in the Midst of the Paradise of God</HI>; and quench our Thirst after Happiness, at the original Fountain of all Good.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<P>I CONCLUDE, with one or two Reflections.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="reflection">
<HEAD>I. WHAT Obligations are we under to the Son of God, who hath purchased this Sal∣vation for the Heirs of Guilt and Misery.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="13" REF="013514_0016_0F90F5AC2D2C25E0"/>No sooner had the Great Creator, introduced Man into a State of Existence, but the Prince of Darkness assaulted his Innocence, and con∣trived his ruin. He filled the Minds of our first Parents, with false Apprehensions of the blessed God; and by this Means betrayed them into a voluntary Disobedience to the divine Law —Immediately the human Nature was degraded and defiled; the Favorites of Heaven became confederates with the Spirits of Hell —As we were Partakers of their Crimes, we were condemned to suffer their Punishment.</P>
<P>BUT the Son of God descended from Hea∣ven, that He might destroy <HI>the Works of the Devil.</HI> He assumed our Nature, with its In∣nocent Infirmities; fulfilled the Law which we had violated; submitted to the Punishment which was the just Demerit of our Crimes— In consequence of this, Salvation is preached to all Nations; the greatest Sinners are invited to return to their offended Maker: Free Access is opened to the Throne of Grace, and the humble Penitent is assured of Audience and Acceptance.</P>
<P>THEY who improve these happy Advantages, and confide in this all-sufficient Saviour, im∣mediately experience the Compassions of his Heart, and the Power of his Hands. He abo∣lishes their Guilt, and constitutes them Heirs of the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI> He inspires them with
<PB N="14" REF="013514_0017_0F90F091AF1DF360"/>
his blessed Spirit, which conquers their native Corruption, and forms them to a divine and heavenly Life. He gives them <HI>the Peace of God which passes all Understanding;</HI> refreshes them under their various Afflictions, with the Visits of his Love; and sometimes gives them transporting Earnests of the Happiness reserved for them in a future World —<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hortly He will descend in all his Mediatorial Glory—and as∣cend the Throne of Judgment. This <HI>Flesh and Blood,</HI> which is hastning to the silent Grave, shall hear his animating Voice, shake off the Sleep of Death, and arise Glorious and immor∣tal: Our whole Man shall partake of his Tri∣umphs, and rejoice forever in his Love.</P>
<P>AND now, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> who of us does not say—May I be of the happy Number— May my Portion be with the <HI>Nations of the Redeemed</HI>—May I, O adorable SAVIOUR, <HI>see the Good of thy chosen, and rejoice with the Gladness of thine Inheritance.</HI></P>
<P>IS this our Language—then,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="reflection">
<HEAD>II. To obtain this Happiness, ought to be our principal Care.</HEAD>
<P>TO be happy, is the universal Desire of all Mankind. There are two Kinds of Happiness that present themselves to our View and court our Affections: The one consists in the Enjoy∣ment of the Pomps and Pleasures of this Life,
<PB N="15" REF="013514_0018_0F90F5ACECEDF400"/>
the other in the Dignity and Privileges of the Children of God. The <HI>Men who have their Portion in this Life,</HI> choose their Happiness in a World that groans under the Wrath of indignant Heaven: The Men who embrace the Salvation of the Gospel, place their Felicity in a World that is filled <HI>with the Loving-kindness of God.</HI> This world is the melancholy Abode of Darkness and Disorder; the future is perpe∣tually illuminated with the Rays of the divine Glory. Every Thing here below is subject to continual Change, but the Felicity of the Saints above is free from all Vicissitudes. The Earth with all its Splendors, must perish in the Flames, but Heaven, the Throne of God, endures for ever.</P>
<P>DETACH, therefore, O Professors of the Gospel, your Affections from this Scene of Vanity, fix your Desires <HI>on a better Country,</HI> which is <HI>reserved in Heaven:</HI> Why should we amuse ourselves with Dreams of Happiness, in these Regions of Darkness, when Christ hath purchased for us a World of Light and Joy?— <HI>Encompassed with so great a Cloud of Witnesses, who have finished their Course with Joy, we should run with Patience the Race which is set before us, looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith.</HI> AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON II. SALVATION by GRACE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>EPHESIANS II. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>For by <HI>GRACE</HI> are ye saved.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>PRIDE introduced the Apostacy of our first Parents, and in all Ages proves the Destruction of Multitudes.—This ani∣mates Princes to unsheath the Sword of War, and Millions are sacrificed to their aspiring Views.—This sows the Seeds of Contention in Churches and Commonwealths, the public Safety is endangered to gratify the Pride and Resentment of a few Individuals.—This de∣stroys the Peace and good Order of private Families, and renders those that were united in the tenderest Bonds, Enemies to each other.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="013514_0020_0F90F0926D938AA0"/>BUT the melancholy Consequences of an arrogant and ambitious Mind are not confined to the present Life, they extend to a future State, and exclude Mankind from the only Way of Salvation that is provided for a guilty World. Vain Man would be wiser than God and attempts to regain his forfeited Felicity by his own Strength. Instead of acknowledging his Dependance on sovereign Grace, he seeks for Something in Himself, that shall placate his offended Maker. Unwilling to ascribe the entire Glory of his Salvation to God, he aspires to be, in some Degree, the Author of his own Recovery and Happiness.</P>
<P>THIS was the fatal Mistake of the Jewish Zealots and the Pagan Philosophers. This influenced them to oppose the Progress of the Gospel from it's first Appearance, and persecute it's Professors with inflexible Severity.</P>
<P>THE Jews intoxicated with an Opinion of their own Righteousness, expected to be saved by their Obedience to the Law. The Pagan Moralists, puffed up with a vain Conceit of their superior Wisdom, imagined their Happi∣ness was in their own Hands, independent of any foreign Assistance.—Happy would it be for the Christian Church, if this Presumption had not entered it's sacred Inclosure, and in∣fected the Minds of those who call themselves the Disciples of a <HI>crucified Savior.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="013514_0021_0F90F0932D101260"/>BUT every imagination of this Nature is fully overthrown by the inspired St. Paul in the Words of my Text.—If there were no other Passage in Scripture but this, it would be suffi∣cient to destroy the Pretentions of human Vanity, and direct Mankind from whence they must expect all their Happiness and Safety.— <HI>By Grace are ye Saved.</HI></P>
<P>EVERY impartial Observer, must be imme∣diately sensible, that these Words plainly declare that the Salvation of Mankind is not the Effect of their own Policy or Power, but an undeserved Favor: That it cannot be obtained by the Im∣provement of our natural Abilities, but de∣scends from <HI>the Father of Lights, the Giver of every good Gift.</HI></P>
<P>IN discoursing on this Point, I shall enquire what is intended by Grace—How it appears that the Salvation of Sinners is entirely of Grace.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST. WHAT is intended by GRACE.</HEAD>
<P>GRACE signifies a free Favor, not granted to Merit—not founded on superior Excellence —but flowing from unpurchased Benevolence. That Angels are adorned with the noble Perfections of their Nature, placed in the hea∣venly Sanctuary, preserved in their primitive Integrity, and made the favorite Ministers of
<PB N="19" REF="013514_0022_0F90F5B11442D420"/>
Divine Providence, must be ascribed to unme∣rited Grace. No Creature can challenge any Thing of the Creator: All their Excellencies flow from his disinterested Goodness.</P>
<P>ADAM was made an Inhabitant of Paradise, advanced to the Government of this lower World, by the same free Favor. All the Privi∣leges of his Nature, and the Advantages of his Situation, were the Effects of pure Goodness. —But when Man lost the Glory of his Inno∣cence and became a guilty Criminal—then the Triumphs of Grace appeared in the most illustrious Point of Light.—Innocent Man had nothing to claim from his Maker, but what flow'd from his gracious Promise—and sinful Man had every Thing to fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from his offended Sovereign, whose Favors he had abused.— When, therefore, God delivers us from the Punishment we had deserved, and restores us to the Privileges we had forfeited, it is not <HI>only Grace,</HI> but <HI>the Riches of Grace.</HI> He bestows his Favors on those who are so far from having any Excellency to recommend them, that their Guilt justly exposes them to his severest Dis∣pleasure.</P>

Heaven, and gives them a Title to the Happi∣ness of Life eternal. I am now to enquire,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SECONDLY, How it appears that the Salva∣tion of Sinners is entirely of Grace.</HEAD>
<P>IF we examine the various Parts of this Salvation—if we survey it's different Degrees —if we pursue it's Progress in all the Periods of the present Life, and through the unceasing Ages of Eternity, we shall be immediately convinced—That it cannot be challenged as a Claim of Justice—it cannot be acquired by the Powers of unregenerate Nature—nor are we introduced into this happy State as the Reward of our good Works.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. IT cannot be challenged as a Claim of Justice.</HEAD>
<P>IF the revolted Posterity of Adam were to appear at the Tribunal of Justice, they must be covered with the greatest Confusion, and in∣evitably receive the Sentence of eternal Death. <HI>If God should enter into Judgment with</HI> Sinners, all must be condemned to remediless Destruc∣tion. The Honor of the divine Government requires that the Transgression of the Law be punished with impartial Severity. The infinite Perfection of the Deity renders Sin the Object of his immutable Aversion: This He will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> discover to the View of the whole intelli∣gent

Creation. If therefore Almighty Grace had not contrived a Way to answer the De∣mands of Justice, every Sinner of the human Race must have fallen a Sacrifice to it's righ∣teous Claims.—That Justice which expelled the apostate Angels from the Happiness of Heaven, would have condemned rebellious Man to the Torments of Hell—Angels and Men united to reject the Authority of the Great God, and deserved the same Punishment.—That Men are Prisoners of Hope, and fallen Angels delivered over to final Despair, is not the Claim of Justice, but the Work of distinguishing Grace.—This pities Criminals condemned to Death, freely forgives their Offences, and restores them to Favor.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>II. As Salvation is not a Claim of Justice; neither can it be acquired by the Powers of unregenerate Nature.</HEAD>
<P>FOR Human Nature in it's present degenerate State is deeply and universally corrupted: Not only averse to that which is spiritually good, but fatally inclined to that which is evil —When God descended from Heaven to survey the State of the moral World—This is the melancholy Report—<HI>The Thoughts and Imaginations of Mens Hearts are evil, only evil, and that conti∣nually.</HI>—In conformity to this divine Testimony <HI>St. Paul,</HI> who learnt his Divinity in the School of Heaven, declares that of ourselves we are
<PB N="22" REF="013514_0025_0F90F5B29A00DC40"/>
<HI>insufficient for so much as a good Thought</HI>— If insufficient to think a good Thought, then certainly incapable to perform a good Action. Our BLESSED SAVIOR assures us, that <HI>a bad Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit;</HI> nor a corrupt <HI>Fountain</HI> send forth salutary <HI>Streams.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this Plan the most inlightned Teachers of the Christian Church have always maintained, that the Performances of unregenerate Sinners don't recommend them to the especial Favor of God, nor give them a Claim to the saving Gifts of his Holy Spirit. A diligent Cultiva∣tion of our rational Powers—a Life conducted by the Precepts of moral Virtue, adorn the Characters of Men and render them Blessings to Civil Society: But they cannot be accepta∣ble to God, when they flow from <HI>a carnal Mind,</HI> which an inspired Apostle declares <HI>is Enmity to God.</HI></P>
<P>MEN who are favored with divine Revelation certainly enjoy Advantages superior to those who have no other Instructor than the Light of Nature;—but these will be ineffectual to our Salvation, if not accompanied with the internal Operations of the Spirit. The Word of God may sound in our Ears, and not penetrate our Hearts.—Let the Law proclaim it's formidable Curses, we shall be deaf to it's alarming Voice —Let the Gospel publish it's gracious Invita∣tions, we shall be unaffected with it's delightful
<PB N="23" REF="013514_0026_0F90F0956ED4B560"/>
Sound—Let the <HI>Ministers of</HI> CHRIST <HI>lift up their Voices like Trumpets,</HI> and address their Hearers with all the Charms of Coelestial Elo∣quence, <HI>they labor in vain, and spend their Strength for nought,</HI> if these Means are not attended with a divine Influence. It is the Prerogative of Omnipotent Grace to open the Eyes of the Blind, unstop the Ears of the Deaf —communicate a Principle of Life to those who are <HI>dead in Trespasses and Sins,</HI> and incline them to walk in the Way that leads to eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>WITHOUT this, the Light of Nature with all it's Improvements; the Law with all it's Precepts; the Gospel with all it's transporting Discoveries; will be a <HI>Savor of Death unto Death:</HI> We shall remain under the Dominion of Sin: The Advantages we enjoy will only serve to increase our Guilt and render us in∣excusable at the Tribunal of Justice.</P>
<P>IF the Improvement of our natural Powers, or the Advantages of external Revelation were sufficient for our Salvation—why was the Spirit sent down to inlighten the Minds of Men, and sanctify their Souls?—We must then certainly conclude, the Powers of human Na∣ture are too weak, and all external Advantages insufficient, to produce any saving Effect. The Grace of God must triumph over the Weak∣ness of Men, or Sinners would perish in their Corruption and Misery. I add,</P>

<HEAD>III. WE are not made Partakers of this Sal∣vation as the Reward of our good Works.</HEAD>
<P>MANY profess an high Esteem for the in∣spired Scriptures, and acknowledge that Grace is a necessary Assistant to frail and fallible Man: But they depend on the Sincerity of their Hearts, the Purity of their Intentions, the Re∣gularity of their Lives, to recommend them to this important Blessing. They compliment God as the Author of their Salvation; but think their own virtuous Dispositions are essen∣tial Qualifications to prepare them for the Re∣ception of so great a Good.—Thus they form a Scheme plausible to human Reason— soothing to the natural Vanity of our Minds— but subversive of the established Order of Salvation.</P>
<P>IT is universally allowed, that all who are saved, <HI>are created anew in</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>unto good Works,</HI> and diligently endeavor to walk in the Practice of them.—But then this is a certain Consequence, not a previous Condition, of an Interest in the Salvation of the Gospel. We must be delivered from the Dominion of Sin, before we can perform the Duties of acceptable Obedience. Jesus saves us from the Hands of Sin and Satan, our spiritual Enemies, that we may be qualified <HI>to serve God in Holi∣ness and Righteousness.</HI> The Giver of all Good will not alter his Plan, to gratify the Pride of
<PB N="25" REF="013514_0028_0F90F0962E357BA8"/>
unhumbled Nature, and accommodate Himself to the Schemes of human Invention.—The only Question to be decided is this—Is an In∣terest in Christ and his Salvation freely given— or conferred as the Reward of some antecedent Goodness?—Our Master has determined the Poin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and methinks his Authority should silence all Disputes—Let us hear the unerring Teacher of the Christian Church and submit to his sacred Dictates. <HI>As the Branch cannot bear Fruit of itself except it abide in the Vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</HI> To abide in Christ must certainly imply that we are united to him, and that this Union remains undissolved. This we are assured is a requisite Preparation <HI>to our bringing forth Fruit,</HI> or per∣forming any good Work. If it were needful to add any thing further, I might adduce the express Testimony of <HI>St. Paul, Not by Works of Righteousness which we have done, but ac∣cording to his Mercy he saved us, by the Wash∣ing of Regeneration and the Renewing of the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="conclusion">
<P>I SHALL conclude my Discourse with a few Reflections.</P>
<P>WHAT we have heard affords us a Test, by which we may examine the Truth of the Doctrines we receive—It also gives us a Rule, by which we may determine the Value of the Duties we practice—It points out to us the only Way to secure our future Welfare.</P>

<PB N="26" REF="013514_0029_0F90F5B3CA78D110"/>
<HEAD>I. WE have a Test by which we may examine the Truth of the Doctrines we receive.</HEAD>
<P>THE great Design of God, in the Salvation of Sinners, is to display the Glory of his Grace. <HI>He hath made us to sit down together in hea∣venly Places in Christ Jesus, that He might shew the exceeding Riches of his Grace in his Kindness towards us through Christ Jesus.</HI> To diminish this Grace, is to darken the Glory of the Gospel, and deprive the blessed God of that Tribute of Praise He expects from all his redeemed People.</P>
<P>EVERY Opinion which exalts the Powers of human Nature in it's present degenerate State, undermines the Foundation of the Christian Faith, and prevents us from that Resignation to divine Sovereignty, which becomes the Cha∣racter of apostate Creatures. That Doctrine which ascribes the entire Glory of our Salva∣tion to God bears the Stamp of Divinity, and will ever recommend itself to those who have been taught in the School of a crucified Savior.</P>
<P>IT has always been the Stratagem of Satan, to employ the Powers of Wit and Learning, to support the Fabrick of human Pride and render Men vain in their own Imaginations: But it is the constant Work of the Spirit to humble the Sinner in the Dust; convince him that he is absolutely lost; that there is no Possibility of his Recovery, but by a Grace to which he has no Claim, which he has forfeited
<PB N="27" REF="013514_0030_0F90F5B4918B0338"/>
a thousand Ways.—Unilluminated Minds may approach the Throne of God with a long Cata∣logue of their good Works: But those who are acquainted with their own true Character, will come before the Divine Majesty with no other Plea than that of the penitent <HI>Publican—God be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI>—This is the only Method to glorify God, and consult our own Safety.</P>
<P>IF this Doctrine which teaches us to re∣nounce all Dependance upon our selves, in every Form—to place our entire Trust on so∣vereign and unmerited Grace, is a Mistake, it is a perfectly innocent one.—It can't be at∣tended with any dangerous Consequences— it will not be displeasing to that Being who assures us <HI>He giveth Grace to the Humble.</HI>— What is my Crime?—It can only be this— I entertain too mean an Opinion of myself; I degrade apostate Nature too low; I form too favorable Sentiments of the Riches of divine Grace, when I suppose God bestows Salvation as a free Gift, and that He confers his choicest Favors <HI>without Money and without Price.</HI>— Is this my Error?—Is this the Fault I am charged with?—I am perswaded I shall not be ashamed of it at the Supreme Tribunal, how∣ever I may be reproached by the polite Rea∣soners of the Day: I shall not repent of it in Heaven, whatever Inconveniencies I may suffer upon Earth: Men may ridicule my Weakness, but God will approve of every Attempt to ad∣vance the Honor of his Grace.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="013514_0031_0F90F5B5343D8518"/>THIS is the only Revenue He receives from all the stupendous Designs of his Love; all Endeavors to deprive Him of this will be con∣demned as the highest Sacrilege and punished with the severest Vengeance.—I run no Risk, when I acknowledge my extreme Indigence and Misery: But I incur the greatest Danger, when I do not adore God as the Author of all Good. This is the Language of the inspired Oracles—<HI>O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself, but in Me is thy Help.</HI>—Upon every amiable Disposition we possess—upon every virtuous Action we perform, we should engrave this humble Inscription—<HI>This is not of ourselves, it is the Gift of God.</HI> If there is any real Good in us, it is planted by the Hand of our heavenly Father, watered by his Grace, and flourishes by the Influences of his Holy Spirit. —Were I, like <HI>St. Paul,</HI> advanced to the Dig∣nity of an Apostle, transported to Paradise, and favored with the Visions of Glory; with him I desire to be sensible <HI>I am the Chief of Sin∣ners,</HI> and acknowledge that all tiie Privileges which distinguish me from the vilest of Men, are the Gifts of God.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="reflection">
<HEAD>II. WE have a Rule by which we may deter∣mine the Value of the Duties we practice.</HEAD>
<P>A great Part of Mankind cast off all Reve∣rence of the Deity, are insensible of their im∣mortal interests, and neglect the Service they owe to the supreme Lord and Lawgiver.—
<PB N="29" REF="013514_0032_0F90F096ED19F5A0"/>
Among many who make a more plausible Profession of Religion, a Fear of the divine Displeasure, a Dread of future Punishment, is the only Motive of Obedience.—But if <HI>by Grace we are saved,</HI> then it is a Discovery of this Grace that encourages us to engage in the Service of God; a Dependance on it's constant Assistance, that animates us in all the Duties of the Christian Life.</P>
<P>To serve God only from a Principle of Fear, is not the Disposition of his Children, but the Character of a Slave. In this Frame of Mind all our Performances are constrained; we ab∣stain from Sin with Reluctance: We should indulge every vicious Appetite with Pleasure if we were not afraid of eternal Misery. These Services therefore, tho' performed to the greatest exactness, can't be acceptable to God: For He demands the Obedience of the Heart, and re∣ceives none but a <HI>willing People:</HI> All his Ser∣vants are convinced of the Excellency and Glory of his Character, they are captivated with the Discoveries of his free Grace which is ten∣dered to the greatest of Sinners: They admire that Wisdom and Love which hath provided Salvation for those who have no recommending Qualities to establish a Claim to this Blessing▪ They therefore bow down the Head and adore this disinterested Goodness—with Transports of Joy, they accept of the Gift of a SAVIOR. —Looking up to Him for <HI>Wisdom, Righteous∣ness, Sanctification,</HI> and <HI>eternal Redemption.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="013514_0033_0F90F5B5EEC7EFD8"/>THIS astonishing Grace inclines them to re∣nounce with Detestation the Practice of Vice, and with Pleasure to engage in the Service of so amiable a Master. His Commandments are not a disagreeable Task, but their daily Business and Delight.—He loved them when they were nothing but Guilt and Misery, and shall they not love Him, who is worthy of their undivid∣ed Affection!—He hath delivered them from the Terrors of Death, and shall they not devote their future Lives to the Glory of their great Benefactor!</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="reflection">
<HEAD>III. The Doctrine of my Text points out unto us the only Way to secure our future Welfare.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the most interesting Inquiry of all Mankind, <HI>wherewith shall I come before God, or bow myself before the</HI> MOST HIGH?—How shall I appear with Safety at the Tribunal of infinite Purity, and obtain that Salvation which is provided for the People of God?—If <HI>by Grace we are saved,</HI> then we must apply to this Grace as our only Resource—If it is the Gift of God, then we can only obtain it by an humble and grateful Reception.</P>
<P>THIS Way, though appointed by infinite Wisdom, is often esteemed Foolishness by Men—though revealed in almost every Page of the Gospel, is ridiculed by the <HI>Disputers of this World</HI>—But all <HI>that are taught of God</HI> are made to renounce every Claim, and receive
<PB N="31" REF="013514_0034_0F90F097AFBED6E0"/>
Salvation in it's Beginning, Progress, and Com∣pletion, as the free Gift of God through Jesus Christ. If we reject this there is no sure Foundation, on which we can build our Hopes of eternal Happiness. We must live in perpe∣tual Doubt, and if our Consciences are not stupified, die in distressing Agonies.</P>
<P>WHATEVER vain Men may pretend, the Testimony of their own Hearts convinces them that they have sinned against that God with whom <HI>is terrible Majesty;</HI> that they have no Righteousness which can stand the critical Examination of the supreme Tribunal:—They may put on a gay Appearance in the Days of their Health, and silence the Reproaches of their own Minds, when surrounded with the Smiles and Flatteries of the World—But when the <HI>King of Terrors</HI> approaches, and a mortal Distemper summons them to appear before their Almighty Judge—When the Skill of Physicians fails, and their Friends stand round their dying Beds, with an unavailing Pity— When the immortal Spirit is just ready to take it's Flight into the invisible World—When a few Moments must determine their eternal Destiny—If now they have no Hope, but what arises from the Purity of their Hearts, and the Righteousness of their Lives—What Visions of Wrath will present themselves to their guilty Minds!—What Fears of future Ven∣geance disturb and distract the departing Hour!</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="013514_0035_0F90F5B6AD6640E0"/>BUT if in the happy Days of Health we humbly accept the Proposals of divine Grace, and fly to that Refuge which astonishing Good∣ness has prepared for the Security of Sinners— We have a sure Foundation for Comfort in Life and Hope in Death—We may now possess <HI>that Peace of God, which passes all Understanding</HI>; and rejoice in the certain Prospect of future Felicity and Glory—We may look down on the Splendors of this World with a calm Dis∣dain; knowing we have a nobler Portion re∣served for us in Heaven. We may stand upon the utmost Verge of the present Life, with untrembling Hearts, and welcome the happy Day which lands us on the immortal Shore.</P>
<P>AND now, my Brethren, who of us does not think this Happiness worthy to be desired with Ardor, to be embraced with Raptures of Gratitude.</P>
<P>BEHOLD. I <HI>bring you glad Tidings of great Joy.</HI>—This Happiness will be the Portion of ALL who receive it as the free Gift of God, through the Merits and Righteousness of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>I am sensible, this is a Doctine hard to be believed; and when believed is perpetually opposed by the Pride and Prejudices of human Nature.—Though it forms the brightest Glory of the Gospel and gives the greatest Encou∣ragement to indigent and perishing Sinners.— Though it contains a Truth, sufficient to make
<PB N="33" REF="013514_0036_0F90F0986D302550"/>
every Heart leap for Joy, and every Tongue celebrate the Praises of God—Yet Nothing is more contrary to the prevailing Sentiments of Mankind—Nothing has occasioned warmer Disputes in the <HI>Church of God.</HI>—Our natural Dispositions are as averse to receive Salvation by free Grace, as to submit to the Laws of the divine Government.—We seek for some recom∣mending Qualities which shall render us proper Objects of the divine Favor, and give us some Kind of Title to the Blessings of his Grace. We cannot think we have a Right to trust in Christ for Privileges so incomparably excellent; which will make us happy in Time and Eternity, till we are possessed of some previous Righ∣teousness to secure us a welcome Reception.</P>
<P>THUS, by a proud Pretence of Humility, we refuse to give to God the Glory of <HI>the Riches of his Grace</HI>—By an <HI>evil Heart of Unbelief,</HI> we keep at a Distance from the Fountain of all Good—We seek to obtain that in ourselves, which can only be obtained from the Fulness that is in Christ.</P>
<P>TURN a deaf Ear, O my Brethren, to the Dictates of corrupt Reason—Hearken to the SON OF GOD, who descended from the Bosom of the FATHER, to instruct a misguided World in the Way to Happiness.—To whom did He dispatch his commissioned Messengers?—To those whose Dignity commanded Respect— whose Wealth recommended them to Favor
<PB N="34" REF="013514_0037_0F90F5B76CDECD18"/>
—whose good Qualities required they should be treated with Distinction?—No—They were sent to those who were in the most forlorn, destitute and miserable Circumstances—who had Nothing to invite the Esteem, but every Thing which might provoke the Aversion of their generous Benefactor.</P>
<P>WHAT is the Message these Ministers of Heaven are commanded to deliver?—<HI>That all Things are ready.</HI> Every Thing that is neces∣sary to free them from the Guilt—cleanse them from the Pollution of Sin—to justify them at the Tribunal of infinite Purity, and prepare them for the Enjoyment of heavenly Happiness.</P>
<P>THE Demands of Justice are satisfied—the Price of your Salvation is paid—You are freely invited to receive the Justification of your Per∣sons—the Sanctification of your Nature and complete Happiness.</P>
<P>IS this the Language of our adorable Re∣deemer?—Then surely it becomes us not to question his Fidelity, or diminish the Riches of his Grace.—Does he call us?—It is not Presumption but a Duty to obey his Voice, and accept his kind Invitation. The inestimable Pri∣vileges purchased by his Blood are not the Sale but the Gift of God. They who receive them in the appointed Way—freely—give Glory to God and secure their immortal Welfare.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON III. The Nature of FAITH.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>EPHESIANS II. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>By Grace are ye saved <HI>THROUGH FAITH.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THERE is in many Respects a surprising Correspondence, between the Means by which we were betrayed into Ruin, and the Methods which infinite Wisdom em∣ploys for our Recovery.—By the Rebellion of the <HI>first Adam,</HI> we are made Sinners; by the Obedience of the <HI>second,</HI> we are constituted Righteous—In consequence of our Relation to the primitive Transgressor, our Natures are universally corrupted and defiled; by an Union to our divine Redeemer, we are <HI>sanctified in Spirit, Soul and Body</HI>—We lost the Glory of our Innocence by hearkening to the <HI>Father of Lies;</HI> we are restored to the Favor and Image of God, by giving Credit <HI>to the Word of Truth</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="013514_0039_0F90F5BCB3C013D0"/>
—By trusting to Satan we became miserable; by believing in Him who came <HI>to destroy the Works of the Devil,</HI> we recover our forfeited Happiness—This is that sublime Truth which is taught us in the Words of my Text— <HI>By Grace are ye saved through Faith.</HI></P>
<P>IN my following Discourse I shall endeavor to explain the Nature of that FAITH by which we are saved—and conclude with some IMPROVEMENT.</P>
<P>THERE is a Faith which is common to the Children of God and the Servants of Sin. Faith is often mentioned as the distinguishing Character of the Saints, and sometimes is ascribed to the worst of Beings. It formed the brightest Glory of Abraham the <HI>Friend of God</HI>—and inspires the apostate Spirits <HI>with Fear and Trembling.</HI> There must then, be an essential Difference between that Faith by which we are saved and that which may accompany us to eternal Damnation.</P>
<P>FAITH considered in a religious Sense is an Assurance of those Truths, which are revealed in the inspired Scriptures—It is founded, not on the Conjectures of human Reason, but on the Authority of God the Revealer. Every Thing which God has revealed or promised; every Thing which is contained in the Volumes of the Old and New Testament; is the proper Object of Faith. But the especial Object of
<PB N="37" REF="013514_0040_0F90F5BE058A07A0"/>
that Faith, which is the distinguishing Charac∣teristic of the real Christian, is JESUS CHRIST —the eternal SON OF GOD—the appointed SAVIOR of a revolted World —He offered up himself a Sacrifice to divine Justice, that we might not be condemned at it's awful Bar—He ful∣filled all Righteousness, that we might have a valid Title to the Reward of Life eternal — He is proposed in the Gospel in all the Glories of an allsufficient and condescending SAVIOR, to be received as <HI>the Gift of God,</HI> to be trusted in by all those who are sensible of their Guilt and Misery, and desire to obtain the Blessings of Salvation.—Faith is a Perswasion, that it is the sole Prerogative of this adorable Person to restore our lapsed Race to the Favor of God;— or to express myself in the Language of Inspira∣tion, <HI>Neither is there Salvation in any other, for there is no other Name under Heaven given a∣mong Men whereby we must be saved.</HI> Acts iv. 12.</P>
<P>THIS Faith is often described in the Gospel to be a firm Belief—THAT JESUS IS THE SON OF GOD—the promised MESSIAH.— Consequently, that his Doctrine is divine—His Promises certain—which shall infallibly be accomplished in their appointed Order.—We believe what the sacred Historians have recorded of His miraculous Birth—His unspotted Life— His wonderful Works—His meritorious Death —His glorious Resurrection—His triumphant Ascension into Heaven—His prevalent Inter∣cession at <HI>the Right Hand of the Father.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="013514_0041_0F90F5BF78426B88"/>THESE Truths are received as <HI>faithful Say∣ings,</HI> not because they could be discovered by human Reason, but because they are authenti∣cated by a divine Testimony.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>the Son of God</HI> commands us to re∣ceive Him as a Messenger from Heaven, He gives the most unquestionable Evidences of the Divinity of his Mission. He declares that He is <HI>a Teacher sent from God,</HI> and discovers his Claim to this Character by the <HI>Demonstration of the Spirit, and by Power</HI>—He practised the most heroic Virtues in every Period of his Residence among Men—He confirmed his Doctrine by Miracles which could only be performed by an omnipotent Arm—He appears to be the <HI>Prince of Life,</HI> when expiring in the Agonies of Death —He disposes of the Joys of Paradise, when suffering as a condemned Malefactor.</P>
<P>IN this critical Moment, Nature through all her Works declares his Dignity and Glory;— even the Inhabitants of the Grave arise to do Honor to Him who has <HI>the Keys of the invi∣sible World</HI>—He entered the Grave, not by Necessity of Nature, but voluntary Consent.— He triumphed over the <HI>King of Terrors</HI> in his own Dominions, and ascended like an invinci∣ble Conqueror to immortal Life.—This set the Seal of Heaven to the Truth of his Mission, justified his highest Pretensions, and in the most solemn Manner declared that He was exalted to be a PRINCE and a SAVIOR.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="013514_0042_0F90F5BFB60B6F18"/>THEY who yield an unfeigned Assent to these Truths are frequently said to <HI>Believe.</HI> But when this Faith only floats in the Under∣standing, and does not descend into the Heart, captivate the Affections and regulate the Con∣duct of Mankind, it will not evidence that we are true Disciples of Christ, or secure us a Title to the Privileges which he has purchased for his People. <HI>Simon Magus</HI> was made a Prose∣lyte by the Preaching of <HI>Philip</HI>—he was bap∣tized into the Faith of the Gospel, and it is said that <HI>he also believed.</HI>—Yet we have the Testimony of an inspired Apostle, <HI>that his Heart was not right with God: He was in the Gall of Bitterness and Bonds of Iniquity.</HI> Daily Experience teaches us, that Mens Judg∣ments may be convinced, and the Will remain obstinate and perverse. We may give Credit to the Truth of a Doctrine, and our Heart rise up in Opposition against it.</P>
<P>BUT this Faith, instead of being acceptable to God, increases His Displeasure—So far from being beneficial to Men it adds to their Guilt and Misery. A professed Infidel is not so odi∣ous a Character as a perfidious Traitor.—It therefore necessarily follows, that the Faith which is the distinguishing Character of the Children of God, must be of a more excellent Kind than that which we have now been describing.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="013514_0043_0F90F5C087672C10"/>THE Faith which saves us always engages us —unfeignedly to approve the Way of Salva∣tion by <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>—chearfully to accept of Him as our only complete and eternal Savior— humbly to confide in Him for all the promised Blessings which He confers on his People.— These are the inseperable Attendants on a true Faith—and distinguish it from the most spe∣cious Counterfeits.—I shall explain them in their Order.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I. A TRUE Faith engages us to an unfeigned Approbation of the Way of Salvation by Jesus Christ.</HEAD>
<P>MEN who have been educated in the Prin∣ciples of the Christian Faith, often receive them as true, without any Hesitation. When con∣vinced of their Guilt, they acknowledge the Necessity of an Interest in Christ to deliver them from the Punishment they have deserved. Animated with a Dread of future Misery, in∣spired with the Hope of heavenly Happiness, they attempt to give up themselves to Jesus Christ. But all is forced—their only Motive is to remove the Grounds of their present Dis∣quietude—when their Distress vanishes they soon return to their former Sins, or satisfy themselves with a Round of religious Perfor∣mances, and a Conversation outwardly inoffen∣sive and regular. The Name of <HI>Jesus</HI> is heard with Indifference.—Persons of this Character often prove the greatest Opposers of the unadul∣terated Doctrines of Grace.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="013514_0044_0F90F5C139A771F8"/>TO form Faith in the Heart, a supernatural Light must be communicated to us from above, to convince us not only of the Truth but Ex∣cellency and Glory of the Plan of Salvation revealed in the Gospel. We view it not only as divinely true but supremely good.—This conquers our Prejudices, captivates our Hearts, produces a chearful Acquiescence in the De∣signs of redeeming Love.—We admire this Method of Salvation, as the Contrivance of infinite Wisdom, the Product of amazing Be∣nevolence.—We behold the Character of the Deity displayed in it's brightest Glory, and the richest Grace discovered to perishing Sinners. —Awful Justice maintains the Authority of the Law; and Mercy triumphs in the Recovery of a lapsed World.—Sin is severely punished, and the Sinner received to Favor—Our Surety dies to fulfil the Penalty of the Law—and in his Obedience unto Death accomplishes a per∣fect Righteousness in behalf of his People.</P>
<P>IN Compliance with this marvellous Plan, the glad Tidings of a Savior are preached to rebellious Men, and all Nations are invited to accept Salvation through his Merits and Medi∣ation.—When this is clearly discovered to the Mind, it puts a final Period to all our former Contrivances to recommend ourselves to the Favor of God: We come to a fixed Determi∣nation to seek for Happiness only through the Grace and Righteousness of our adorable

Redeemer. We believe it to be not only <HI>a faithful Saying,</HI> but <HI>worthy of all Acceptation,</HI> that <HI>Christ came into the World to save the Chief of Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>INCREDULOUS Men may form a thousand Objections against that Way of Salvation, which strips the Sinner of all preparatory Goodness, brings him as a convicted Criminal to the Footstool of Sovereign Grace, to expect all his Blessedness from the Merit and Obe∣dience of another.—Yet this very View (which is so great an Offence to the Pride of unhum∣bled Nature) attracts the Admiration and Gra∣titude of every inlightned Mind. They adore a crucified Savior as the Wisdom and Power of God.—This is the Language of their en∣raptured Hearts—
<Q>This is a Scheme which secures the Honor of the Supreme Governor of the Universe, and provides for the Safety of self-destroyed Man—God appears encom∣passed with the most awful and amiable Glory—the Pride of all Flesh is humbled in the Dust—the Believer is rescued from de∣served Misery and raised to immortal Happi∣ness.—This reveals a Savior, exactly adapted to the Circumstances of destitute condemned MalefactorS, who have no good Qualities to recommend them; who have Nothing but the most abject Wretchedness to move the divine Compassions.</Q></P>

<HEAD>II. CHEARFULLY to accept of <HI>Christ</HI> as our complete and eternal Savior.</HEAD>
<P>THE Revelation of the Gospel discovers to me an allsufficient Savior; the Illuminations of the Spirit represent this Savior as incompa∣rably excellent—the most desirable Good—a Treasure which will inrich me to Eternity.— The next Question which naturally arises in an awakened Mind, is this—May I hope for an Interest in this inestimable Blessing?—Will this illustrious Person accept an ungrateful Rebel?— Will he bestow Life and Salvation on me, who deserve Nothing but Death and Damnation?</P>
<P>THESE Objections are in a great Measure removed by the Views I described under the last Head of my Discourse.—For the Freedom and Riches of divine Grace, to the greatest of

Sinners, is an essential Part of the Glory which is displayed in the Gospel. But we are naturally <HI>slow of Heart to believe</HI>: A self-righteous Spirit appears in a Variety of Forms to obstruct our Approaches to God through Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, the Word of God abounds with universal, unlimited Invitations to Sinners of every Order, Character and Degree, to accept of the Blessings of Salvation <HI>without Money and without Price.</HI> These are bestowed, not on those who have any previous Virtues to authorise their Claim, but on polluted, im∣poverished, and necessitous Bankrupts: They are to be received as a free Donation, and are the unfailing Portion of all that highly esteem and thankfully accept them.</P>
<P>THIS good News to a guilty World is not contained in a few obscure Texts, tortured by the Arts of Criticism to serve a favorite System, but is the uniform Language of Inspiration, clothed in a Variety of Expressions, repeated with the most affectionate Tenderness.—When THE SON OF GOD opened his divine Com∣mission, with what Meekness, with what Con∣descension did He address his Hearers!—<HI>The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He hath appointed Me to preach the Gospel to the Poor, to proclaim Deliverance to Captives.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="013514_0048_0F90F5C39B906D50"/>IN the public Course of his Ministry, He declares his compassionate Designs in the most expressive Terms; to remove every Doubt, to dissipate every Fear that might arise in the Breasts of Sinners and assure them of a wel∣come Reception.—He stands in a promiscuous Multitude, incircled with Numbers of his in∣veterate Enemies, and cries with a loud Voice, with affectionate Vehemence, <HI>If any Man thirst let him come to me and drink:</HI> Though involved in the deepest Guilt, covered with the most loathsome Deformity, if he earnestly desires the Blessings of Salvation, let him repair to Me; I will supply all his Wants, deliver him from all his Distresses, and quench his Thirst after Happiness with <HI>Fountains of living Waters.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN our blessed Lord had finished His Work upon Earth, and ascended on high in Majestie Triumph, He received the most inesti∣mable <HI>Gifts,</HI> to be conferred not on the vir∣tuous and deserving, but for the disobedient and <HI>rebellious.</HI> Therefore from his exalted Throne in Glory, He declares the generous Intentions of his Heart, and closes the Canon of the Sacred Scriptures with this Royal Pro∣clamation, <HI>Whosoever will, let him come to the Waters of Life freely.</HI></P>
<P>ANIMATED by these kind Invitations, sup∣ported by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se reiterated Assurances of Success, the Believer bows down at the Feet of JESUS,

and thankfully accepts the offers of His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ He does not derive his Encouragement from any Good he observes in himself; but from the free, universal Tenders of divine Grace to all, without any exclusive Clause, to prevent the most indigent and wretched, from a Parti∣cipation of these incomparable Benefits—The good-will of God—the Merits of CHRIST are the only Foundation of his Hope—Thus he addresses himself to the adorable Jesus in the Language of humble Faith—O! Thou conde∣scending Savior! I acknowledge that by Sin I am become a Child of Wrath, justly condem∣ned to suffer the Pains of eternal Death. I renounce all Hopes of Deliverance from any created Wisdom or Power; but Thou art the <HI>Son of God,</HI> and by the Appointment of the Father the commissioned Savior of an apostate World; I therefore commit my Soul into thy Hands, as One every way qualified to provide for its Welfare in Time and Eternity.—O! Thou heavenly Prophet! remove the Vail from my Understanding, enlighten me in the Know∣ledge of the Truth, conduct me by thy Word and Spirit, in the Way that leads to thy eter∣nal Kingdom.—O! Thou great High Priest! sensible that I am a guilty Criminal, I fly to the atoning Merits of thy Blood, to save me from the Punishment I have deserved, and plead thy all-perfect Righteousness that I may be justified at the Tribunal of God.—O!

Thou <HI>Captain of our Salvation!</HI> I trust to thy victorious Arm, to defend me from the Power and Malice of my spiritual Enemies, to subdue the native Corruptions of my Heart, to preserve me faithful to thy Cause, and finally introduce me to the Happiness Thou hast appointed for thy People.—Had not asto∣nishing Grace allowed, nay commanded me, to receive Thee as <HI>the Gift of God,</HI> to accom∣plish these important Purposes, I might justly suspect that my present Address would be re∣jected with Disdain:—But since Almighty Love hath provided a Savior for perishing Sinners— Since unlimited Goodness hath commanded the most unworthy <HI>to look unto Him that they may be saved</HI>—To receive this Gift, to accept this Goodwill is not unwarranted Presumption, but a commanded Duty.

We have a Testimony from Heaven, <HI>that God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting Life:</HI> It is written with an immortal Pen, that <HI>whosoever cometh to the blessed Jesus, He will in no wise cast out.</HI>—If therefore my Eyes have been opened to discern his Excellency—If my Heart has been perswaded to acquiesce in the Designs of his redeeming Love—If it is the Top of my Ambition <HI>to be found in Him,</HI> clothed with his Righteousness, a Monument of his Grace—The Inference is just—the Con∣clusion unfailing—<HI>He is</HI> and will be <HI>made of God unto me Wisdom and Righteousness, Sancti∣fication and Redemption.</HI></P>

<HEAD>I. LET us examine, whether we have that Faith, which is the unfailing Character of the People of God—a certain Evi∣dence that we are made Partakers of the blessings of Salvation.</HEAD>
<P>HAVE I been made sensible of my Sinfulness and Misery; the Corruptions of my Heart, as well as the numberless Pollutions of my Life; of the infinite Evil as well as destructive Conse∣quences of Sin?—Men may talk of free Grace with seraphic Eloquence, and flatter them∣selves with a pleasing Dream, that they are the Favorites of Heaven; but till they perceive the condemning Power of the Law, and subscribe to the Justice of that Sentence which is pro∣nounced against every Transgressor, they con∣tinue under the Dominion of Sin, and see no Beauty and Loveliness in the Savior.</P>
<P>HAVE I been convinced of my utter Inabi∣lity to deliver myself from this Misery? Have I seen the Vanity of all Dependance upon the Uprightness of my Intentions, the Regularity
<PB N="50" REF="013514_0053_0F90F099F0852480"/>
of my Conduct, my humblest Confessions, or deepest Humiliations, to expiate the Guilt of Sin, and satisfy the Justice of offended Heaven? —Without this, I shall inevitably trust to my Prayers, Tears and Amendments to recommend me to the Favor of God—I shall neglect the only Sacrifice which has made complete Atone∣ment for the Sins of Men.</P>
<P>HAVE I accepted the Proposals of the Gospel? The Gospel reveals an Almighty Savior to a ruined World, and by the most perswasive Argu∣ments invites us to receive Him in that amiable Character. Have I heard the joyful Sound with Gratitude, and been made willing to be saved by Christ in his own appointed Way?—Is this the unfeigned Language of my Soul—<HI>Lift up your Heads ye everlasting Gates,</HI> let the KING OF GLORY descend and take the full Possession of all my Powers?—Do I not only depend on his justifying Righteousness; but welcome the sanctifying Influences of his Spirit?—Is He precious in my Esteem, not only as an atoning Priest, but a commanding King;—to mortify my dearest Lusts, as well as to deliver me from the Miseries of Hell;—to form me to an entire Subjection to his Laws, as well as dignify me with the Privileges of his People?</P>
<P>IN fine, is JESUS, in all his sacred Offices, the supreme Object of my Affection? Do I prefer Him to all the Honors and Advantages

<HEAD>II. THEY who pour Contempt on the Love of God manifested by Jesus Christ, neglect their most important Interests.</HEAD>
<P>INTEREST is the grand Spring of human Actions. They who are deaf to the Calls of Duty, insensible of the Obligations of Grati∣tude, are generally influenced by what they imagine to be their Interest.—But it is the In∣felicity of Mankind, that they often confine their Views to the present Moment; and disregard future Consequences: They fix their Eyes on <HI>Things which are seen and temporal,</HI> but are blind to the Excellence and Beauty of <HI>Things unseen and eternal.</HI></P>
<P>WE see Men engaged in a perpetual Hurry, disquieted with perplexing Fears.—Ask them, what is the Matter?—My Honor or Interest is at Stake.—This awakens their sollicitous Concern—and engages them to incessant Acti∣vity and Diligence.—Allow me, my Bre∣thren, to enquire, is it not your Honor and Interest, to be delivered from the Wrath of God, and the unutterable Torments of Hell— to be admitted into the <HI>Family of Heaven</HI> and

<P>WHENCE then is it, that future Happiness is so generally neglected? Whence is it, that Men who discover the most exquisite Sagacity, in securing the Interests of this Life, are so in∣fatuated as to pay little or no Attention to the momentous Affairs of the World to come?— Is it because the supreme Happiness of their Nature is placed out of their Reach?—Is it because there is no Prospect of Success, though they employ their utmost Diligence?—Blessed be God, this is not the Case—Are you ex∣cluded from the <HI>Hope of the Gospel?</HI>—Is the inevitable Sentence passed upon you?— Are you not invited to return to your offended Sovereign?—Does not the Son of God call you by his Word and Spirit to <HI>come to Him that you may have Life?</HI>—If then you are excluded from future Happiness, it is by your own Obstinacy and Perverseness.—If eternal Dam∣nation be your Portion, it is because you pre∣fer your Sins before your Savior, the Pleasures

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO glorify God, the great Author of our Being, ought to be the uninterrupted Employment of every intelligent Crea∣ture. For this we were formed by His Al∣mighty Hand, and redeemed by His marvellous Grace. The First Creation proclaims the Ex∣istence of an all-wise and powerful Deity; the New Creation discovers the Wonders of his Love to his apostate Creatures.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, when the SON OF GOD de∣scended from the Bosom of the FATHER, to tabernacle in human Flesh, a Multitude of <HI>the heavenly Host sang Glory to God in the Highest, Peace upon-Earth and Goodwill to Men.</HI> The Design of this mysterious Dispen∣sation
<PB N="55" REF="013514_0058_0F90F09AAD3A3B58"/>
was to place the Benignity of the Divine Nature in the most amiable and attracting Point of Light:—That the innumerable Orders of Angels might admire the Riches of his Grace —and all the Nations of the Redeemed might pay an eternal Tribute of Praise to Him, who delivered them from the Abyss of Misery, and made them Heirs of celestial Glory. Upon this Account the whole Scheme of Redemption is wisely contrived, to subdue the Pride of Man, to advance the Honor of the MOST HIGH GOD. Therefore in the eternal <HI>Counsels of his Will,</HI> he determined, not only that our <HI>Salva∣tion</HI> should be <HI>of Grace</HI>—but <HI>through Faith.</HI></P>
<P>IN a former Discourse, I explained the Na∣ture of Faith—I shall now endeavor to show, in what Sense we are said to <HI>be saved through Faith</HI>—and then enquire into the Reasons of this divine Constitution.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST, In what Sense are we said to be <HI>saved through Faith.</HI></HEAD>
<P>EVERY Man must be justified <HI>by Law,</HI> or saved <HI>by Grace</HI>—or perish forever.—If I expect to be justified by Law, my Obedience must be perfect, without the smallest Blemish;—uni∣versal, without the least Exception;—perse∣vering without a Moment's Interruption. We appear before the Throne of infinite Purity, and challenge impartial Justice to find any thing in us worthy of Condemnation and Death.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="013514_0059_0F90F5D0635D8B08"/>BUT the Man who expects to be <HI>saved by Grace</HI> acknowledges himself a guilty Criminal, worthy of the severest Punishment:—He is sensible that his best Performances, if examined according to the Purity and Extent of the Law, must be turned into Articles of Indictment against him:—He therefore appeals from the Bar of Justice to the Throne of Grace; hum∣bly confessing that <HI>if God should be strict to mark Iniquity,</HI> he must be eternally condemned: —He pleads the pardoning Mercy of God through the Mediation of Jesus Christ:—The only Foundation of his Hope is—that the Supreme Lawgiver will not deal with him ac∣cording to his personal Demerits, but consider him as united to his dear SON, whom he cor∣dially accepts as his SAVIOR and LORD:— Through Him—though condemned by the <HI>Law,</HI> he expects to be relieved by the <HI>Gospel</HI>— though deserving the Miseries of Hell, he hopes to enjoy the Felicities of the Kingdom of Heaven. <HI>Christ</HI> and He only hath purchased our Salvation, by his infinite Merits;—in his Righteousness we must appear, if we are ac∣cepted at the Tribunal of God. If Christ <HI>had not died for our Offences, and risen again for our Justification,</HI> in vain should we bewail our Sins, reform our Lives, employ our most assi∣duous Endeavors to recover our Innocence and Happiness. Every well instructed Mind will therefore say with <HI>St. Paul, God forbid that I should glory, save in the Cross of Christ.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="013514_0060_0F90F5D3F4EF8B50"/>Of Consequence, when we are said to be <HI>saved through Faith,</HI> it cannot intend that Faith merits our Salvation; or that God gives us eternal Happiness to reward the Excellency and Goodness of our Faith: But it is the appointed Method, in which we are made Par∣takers of the Blessings which Christ hath pur∣chased with his Blood—In this Sense, and no other, is Faith the Condition of our Salvation. This the Gospel testifies through all its inspired Pages.—<HI>If thou shalt confess with thy Mouth</HI> (saith St. Paul) <HI>the Lord Jesus Christ, and shalt believe in thy Heart, that God hath raised Him from the Dead, thou shalt be saved.</HI> —When the awakened Jailor makes the solemn Enquiry—<HI>What shall I do to be saved?</HI> —This is the Answer given by the Ambassadors of Heaven—<HI>Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved</HI>—Nor have the Refine∣ments of later Ages found a directer Entrance into the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>FAITH is that Grace which unites us to the SON OF GOD, the SAVIOR OF THE WORLD: By this Union, we become Partakers of all his Benefits. "Our Guilt is transferred to Him.—His Righteousness is imputed to us." —To express myself in Language dictated by the HOLY GHOST, <HI>He was made to be Sin for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in Him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="013514_0061_0F90F5D568158D08"/>LET us place this Truth in another Point of Light, and make it as intelligible as may be to the meanest Understanding. Salvation is fre∣quently represented as <HI>the Gift of God:</HI> Now we all know, that there is a wide Distinction between that which is bestowed as a free Gift, and that which is obtained as the Reward of Services performed: To establish our Claim to the promised Reward, we must accomplish our Task—finish the appointed Work, and punctually comply with all the Articles specified in the Agreement:—But to enjoy a Gift, No∣thing is requisite, but to realize the Kindness of our Benefactor, and receive his generous Offer with Gratitude.</P>
<P>THE Difference is as great, as between a Workman who is employed on Wages, and an indigent Beggar who lives upon Charity: The Labourer has no Title to the stipulated Wages, till he has completed the Service expressed in the Contract; but the poor Mendicant only receives the Alms which are generously pre∣sented to him.—The Bounty of the Donor authorises his Claim—his grateful Acceptance puts him in Possession of the Benefit.</P>
<P>THIS gives us a perspicuous View of the Method, in which we are made Partakers of the Salvation revealed in the Gospel.—Salvation is not bestowed upon us as the Reward of our good Services:—We cannot challenge it as a
<PB N="59" REF="013514_0062_0F90F09B6CF8F468"/>
Debt from the Hand of Justice;—it is the Gift of unpurchased Bounty:—Our only Part is to accept the Goodwill of our heavenly Father, and ascribe all our Happiness to the Riches of redeeming Love.</P>
<P>THUS we <HI>are saved by Faith</HI>—Faith accepts the condescending Offers of a Savior, and gives God the Glory of that Grace, which He de∣signed to magnify in the Recovery of an apo∣state World.—What is it to believe?—To give Credit to the Report of the Gospel;—to receive that Savior who is freely tendered to us;—to depend on his Righteousness, to give us a Title to the Favor of God;—to resign ourselves to his Spirit, to prepare us for the Enjoyment of Life eternal.</P>
<P>UPON this Foundation, all Pretences to Merit are destroyed; all Claims established on personal Worthiness are disallowed. God gives —and Faith receives a Title to the Dignity and Privileges of <HI>the Sons of God.</HI> There is no Merit in receiving a Gift, though it be necessary to enjoying the Good which is tendered to me. —Thus Faith does not give me an Interest in Christ, on the Foot of Desert; but by Virtue of a Divine Constitution. The Wisdom of the Deity did not see sit, that those should have a Title to this Salvation, who were insensible of their Want of it, or unwilling to receive it:— They are forever excluded, by an irreversible
<PB N="60" REF="013514_0063_0F90F5D58AD5E530"/>
Decree, who obstinately despise, and ungrate∣fully trample under their Feet, the inestimable Blessing.—I am now prepared,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SECONDLY, To enquire into the Reasons of this Divine Constitution.</HEAD>
<P>THE Design of Man's Redemption flowed from the eternal Counsels of Heaven. Before this Universe existed, the Deity foresaw, that many of the free Intelligences He designed to create, would violate the established Orders of his Government and fall from their original Dignity.—His unbounded Benevolence inclin∣ed Him to devise a Method of Recovery, for many of his rebellious Subjects.—The sinning Angels, the first Transgressors, are excluded all Hopes of Mercy;—while the sinful Posterity of Adam are appointed to be the Objects of distinguishing Favors.</P>
<P>INFINITE Wisdom determined, that with∣out vindicating the Honor of the Law, there should be no Remission of Sin—This the Son of God undertook, and voluntarily engaged to save a guilty World.—He exhibits Himself in the Gospel in the Character of a Savior, and gives us the highest Assurance, that all who believe in Him shall experience the blessed Effects of his Power and Grace.—But if Men wilfully refuse the kind Hand that is extended for their Deliverance, there is Nothing remains but that they perish in their Sins.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="013514_0064_0F90F5D6A94F0320"/>THIS is the immutable Appointment, not only of the Sovereignty but Wisdom of Hea∣ven—Faith is the appropriated Way to Life— because it brings nothing with it, but receives all from the Fulness of Christ—It pleads guilty before God, and implores a free Pardon—It acknowledges the Sinner's Inability to all spi∣ritual Good, and supplicates that Grace which must <HI>perform all our Works in us.</HI>—Thus God alone is exalted, and human Vanity prostrate in the Dust: All Self-dependance is renounced and Holiness and Happiness received as a Com∣munication from Christ: The Crown is placed upon the Head of our <HI>incarnate God,</HI> and the entire Glory of our Salvation is ascribed to free Grace.—This forms the Excellency of Faith, and discovers it to be a fit Method to save those who are utterly ruined in themselves. Upon this Account <HI>St. Paul</HI> having declared that we are <HI>saved through Faith,</HI> in the next Verse excludes <HI>Works,</HI> and gives this Reason— <HI>lest any Man should boast.</HI></P>
<P>METHINKS I hear some say—How can Works be excluded; are they not necessary to Salvation?—I acknowledge the Faith that saves us is a vital Principle of universal Holiness. Faith is essentially defective, if it does not pro∣duce good Works.—I further acknowledge, that, Purity of Heart and an uniform Obedience to the divine Commandments, are necessary Ingredients in the Character of those, who
<PB N="62" REF="013514_0065_0F90F5D743B762B0"/>
shall be finally saved.—It is the irrevocable Constitution of Heaven, that <HI>without Holiness no Man shall see the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THE only Controversy between us and those that in this Article differ from us is this— Whether good Works are the Consequences of our Union with Christ and an Interest in his Salvation; or whether they are antecedent Conditions of our obtaining this invaluable Blessing?—We assert the first; and think we are supported, not only by the Authority of <HI>St. Paul,</HI> in the Words of my Text, but by the uniform Tenor of the inspired Writings. <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> are frequently put in a direct and formal Opposition to each other:—That Purity of Heart—that Sanctity of Life—that Victory of Corruption—that unreserved De∣votedness to God—which are the grand Essen∣tials of the Christian Life, are not Virtues we bring with us in our first Approaches to the Savior; but Blessings He bestows on them that come to Him by an humble Faith.</P>
<P>THIS will be uncontroulably evident, if we consider—That our most specious Perfor∣mances, before we are brought into this sa∣cred Union, are corrupt and vicious—With∣out Faith, says the Author to the Hebrews, <HI>it is impossible to please God.</HI>—Without me, says the <HI>Faithful and True Witness, ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an do nothing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="013514_0066_0F90F5D8B0FCE4C0"/>By Faith then are <HI>we saved and not by Works</HI> —For this Salvation is begun, before we can perform any Works that may be truly denomi∣nated Good. We receive Jesus the Savior— We become Members of his mystical Body— By virtue of this—His Righteousness is imputed to us—His Spirit resides in us—This leads us into all Truth—inclines us to all Good— enables us to walk in the Way that will finally conduct us to consummate Purity and Blessedness.</P>
<P>I pass to the Application of my Subject.</P>

<HEAD>I. THIS instructs us in the Difference be∣tween the Law and the Gospel.</HEAD>
<P>THE Law demands perfect and perpetual Obedience, as the Condition of Life; the Gos∣pel requires humble Faith, as the appointed Means of Safety and Happiness: According to the Tenor of the Law, we must have a com∣plete and personal Righteousness, to escape its damnatory Sentence; according to the conde∣scending Terms of the Gospel, the Righteous∣ness of our Surety delivers us from Death, and gives us a Title to Life Eternal.—This is the unalterable Voice of the Law, <HI>do these Things and thou shalt live:</HI>—This the alluring Language of the Gospel, <HI>believe and thou shall be saved.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="013514_0067_0F90F5D942D58E30"/>THE different Terms are wisely adapted to the different States and Circumstances of Man∣kind. The Law was delivered to Man when in a State of unblemished Innocence, in all the Perfection of his Nature, when he had Strength to perform his entire Duty, without Defect or Deviation: But the Gospel considers Man as fallen from his primitive Integrity, destitute of Ability or Inclination to do that which is Good. It is appointed for his Rescue from the Con∣demnation of the Law and the tyrannical Do∣minion of Sin—Therefore it does not call him to purchase Life by his Obedience; but to receive that Grace which alone can enable him <HI>to will and to do:</HI>—Not to expect Happiness from his own Virtue and Goodness, but by an humble Affiance in the Grace and Righteous∣ness of an all sufficient Savior.</P>
<P>EVERY one who does not submit to the <HI>Law of Faith,</HI> must stand or fall by <HI>the Law of Works.</HI> This infallibly condemns all the Posterity of <HI>Adam</HI> without Distinction, whether <HI>Gentile, Jew,</HI> or <HI>Christian.</HI> All have vio∣lated it's righteous Precepts and incurred it's dreadful Penalty.—How terrible is that Dis∣pensation to an awakened Mind, which de∣nounces <HI>Indignation and Wrath, Tribulation and Anguish on every Soul that doeth Evil!</HI>— How admirable that Grace, which reveals JESUS <HI>the Wisdom and Power of God, to the Salvation of every one that believeth!</HI>—How
<PB N="65" REF="013514_0068_0F90F5D9ECA90F48"/>
alarming that Sentence, which <HI>curseth every one, that continueth not in all Things written in the Book of the Law to do them!</HI>—How reviving that Voice which declares that <HI>Christ Jesus delivers us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us,</HI> and assures us that <HI>as many as receive Him have Power to become the Sons of God!</HI></P>

<HEAD>II. WHAT Reason have we to rejoice in the Light and Advantages of the Gospel.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Dispensation, the Grace of God appears in it's brightest Splendor, it's unlimited Freeness; to attract the Attention of perishing Sinners,—The Divine Majesty is seated on a Throne of Grace, and we are invited to touch the <HI>Sceptre</HI> of Mercy <HI>and live:</HI> Angels are commissioned to publish <HI>the Goodwill</HI> of God <HI>to Men:</HI> Ministers are appointed <HI>to preach Peace by Jesus Christ, to them that are afar off and to them that are near.</HI> The Condition of our Reconciliation with an offended Deity, is not indefective Holiness, which must sink us into the deepest Despair, but an humble Faith, which receives All, from the over-flowing Fountain of all Good.</P>
<P>HAPPY are we, my Brethren, though ruined in <HI>Adam,</HI> who have a Way of Recovery re∣vealed by <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT gloomy Fears must arise in the Breast of an uninstructed <HI>Pagan,</HI> when Conscience
<PB N="66" REF="013514_0069_0F90F5DAAD8430F0"/>
accuses him of numberless Violations of the Law of Nature?—If he looks up, he beholds the Heavens darkned with Clouds of Wrath, and Thunders prepared by divine Justice, ready to be discharged on his guilty Head—If he casts his Eyes down upon the Earth, he sees the Grave prepared to receive him, and has just Rea∣son to fear that the Pains of a temporal will transmit him to the Miseries of eternal Death.</P>
<P>To whom shall he apply in this melancholy Situation?—To the Altars of his Gods?—Alas! the superstitious Rites, the uninstituted Sacri∣fices, with which they are approached instead of effacing his Guilt, serve only to increase the Number of his Crimes.—Shall he implore Mercy of the Idols he absurdly worshipeth?— Alas! they have no Eyes to see, no Ears to hear, no Tongues to speak, nor Hearts to pity his Distress.</P>
<P>WHICH Way soever he turns, he finds no Ray of Light to scatter the Gloom that sur∣rounds him on every Side—No friendly Di∣rector to show him the Path of Peace and Safety.—The Light of Nature discovers his Guilt, but can give no Assurance of the divine Favor and Forgiveness—This is the distin∣guishing Glory of the Gospel. Those who hearken to it's indulgent Voice, and trust in it's faithful Promises, may be freed from all disquieting Doubts, and enjoy <HI>that Peace of God, which passeth all Understanding.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="013514_0070_0F90F5DB9FB460F8"/>IN CHRIST we behold—God reconciled— Guilt abolished—the Law fulfilled—Death dis∣armed—the Fire of Hell extinguished—the Joys of Heaven purchased for all that believe and obey Him. These happy Souls may, in the full <HI>Assurance of Faith,</HI> adopt the trium∣phant Challenge of <HI>St. Paul, Who shall lay any Thing to the Charge of God's Elect? It is God that justifieth; who shall condemn? It is Christ that died; yea rather that is risen again, who is even at the Right Hand of God, who also maketh Intercession for us.</HI></P>
<P>O GOD! How kind are thy Dealings unto the Children of Men! How boundless thy Compassions to ungrateful Rebels! How adapted are the Methods of thy Grace to thy destitute Creatures!—Thou knowest the Frailty and Inconstancy of our Natures, therefore commandest us to commit the Keeping of our Souls to an Almighty Savior, who is the <HI>same Yesterday, To-day, and forever.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III. WHILE the Gospel establishes Salvation by Faith, it takes the most effectual Care to engage us in the Practice of universal Holiness.</HEAD>
<P>TRU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Faith infallibly disposes the Mind to an impartial Obedience to the divine Com∣mandments. If it has not this Influence, <HI>St. James</HI> pronounces it <HI>a dead Faith;</HI> and it is the grossest Absurdity to suppose a <HI>dead Faith</HI> can
<PB N="68" REF="013514_0071_0F90F5DC2C659DA8"/>
bring us to the Happiness of eternal Life. Faith subdues the Heart to a chosen Con∣formity to the Nature and Design of the Gospel—What is the Design of the Gospel? —Every one must acknowledge—not only to publish an Act of Indemnity in Favor of condemned Rebels, but to deliver them from the Dominion of their Lusts:—Not only to dignify them with the Title of <HI>Sons,</HI> but enable them to walk as becomes the <HI>obedient Children of God.</HI></P>
<P>CONSEQUENTLY, to rely on Christ to de∣liver us from the Miseries of Hell, and not also to save us from the Service of Sin and Satan, is not the Faith of the Gospel; but a vain Ima∣gination.—Instead of introducing us into the Way of Life, it opens a spacious but dangerous Road, which betrays us to the Chambers of Death. The Faith so highly recommended in the Oracles of God, is always attended with the Influences of the Holy Spirit: This Divine Agent resides in the Heart of the true Believer, dissolves his Attachment to every Sin, causes him to <HI>delight in the Law of God after the inward Man: The Fruits of the Spirit are Love,</HI> and the various Graces which constitute the Christian Life. <HI>They who have not this Spirit of Christ,</HI> are positively declared to be none of His.</P>
<P>NONE believe in Christ, who are not pre∣viously convinced of the Corruption of their
<PB N="69" REF="013514_0072_0F90F5DFDB7772C8"/>
Nature, their Exposedness to the Wrath of God, by their innumerable Violations of his Laws. When brought to acquiesce in the Designs of redeeming Love, we receive the blessed Jesus to save us from Sin, as well as Wrath.—We ardently desire to be made holy, as well as happy. An essential Part of that Salvation which He bestows on his People, is an Heart purified from the Love of Sin, un∣feignedly devoted to the Service of Heaven. <HI>He delivers us out of the Hands of our Ene∣mies, that we might serve Him without Fear, in Holiness and Righteousness all the Days of our Life.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>IV. THEY who perish in their Sins under the Light of the Gospel are of all Men the most inexcuseable.</HEAD>
<P>WHO would not suppose a guilty World would receive the Declarations of divine Grace with Raptures of Joy, and with the deepest Submission accept the offered Favor: But constant Experience teaches us that Multitudes are inattentive to the <HI>joyful Sound,</HI> while others treat it with a profane Contempt.—Whence arises this infatuated Conduct?—A secret Infi∣delity is, doubtless, the Source of that fatal Security which prevails among Mankind. A wavering Assent to the Truths of the Gospel, prevents their chearful Compliance with it's benevolent Design.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="013514_0073_0F90F5E154D02000"/>WERE the Doctrines of Religion built on the vain Imaginations of Men—Were the sublime Hopes of the Christian unsupported with divine Credentials—No wonder the wise and considerate Part of Mankind, should treat it with indifference: Why should we pursue the flattering Illusions of a credulous Mind? Why should we be captivated with airy Pro∣spects, which will probably disappoint our Expectations?</P>
<P>BUT Salvation by Faith is a Doctrine re∣vealed by the <HI>God of Truth,</HI> supported by every Kind of Evidence that can be desired by a reasonable, unprejudiced Mind. <HI>St. Paul</HI> tells us, <HI>that this Salvation at first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard Him, God also bearing them Witness, both with Signs and Wonders, and divers Miracles, and Gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own Will.</HI></P>
<P>THE SON OF GOD, descended from Hea∣ven, cloathed himself with the Infirmities of human Flesh, to reveal these <HI>glad Tidings</HI> to a revolted World. He evidenced his Mission by astonishing Miracles, which bear the Character of infinite Wisdom and resistless Power. These wonderful Works <HI>were not done in a Corner</HI>— in a private Retirement—among a few selected Friends—No—but in the Streets of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in the Presence of Multitudes, in the View of His Enemies.—As the LORD of Nature, the
<PB N="71" REF="013514_0074_0F90F5E1755751B8"/>
Winds and Sea obey His Voice—the most in∣veterate Diseases fly at His Approach—His Commands are heard in the awful Mansions of the Dead, the Inhabitants of the Grave, an∣swer to His Call, and rise to Life and Vigor.— He Dies—the <HI>Heavens</HI> are <HI>darkned,</HI> the <HI>Earth trembles,</HI> the <HI>Rocks are rent.</HI>—He raises Himself from the Dead; Angels descend from Heaven to pay Him Homage, His timorous Disciples acknowledge their <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Lord.</HI> —At length He takes Farewel of this Earth, ascends up to Heaven in the public View of his Followers, the Spirit descends on His Apostles in visible Forms; they are immedi∣ately endowed with the Supernatural <HI>Gift of Tongues</HI>—they also perform illustrious Mira∣cles, in the Name of their ascended Master.</P>
<P>THESE were public and visible Facts—ac∣knowledged by the incredulous Jews, allowed by the most inveterate Enemies of the Christian Faith, in the early Days of the Church—Au∣thorised by these divine Credentials, the Apo∣stles propagated the Religion of JESUS, with surprising Success.—Without Power to awe— without Wealth to bribe—without Eloquence to perswade—They triumphed over the Preju∣dices of the Vulgar, the Reasonings of the Philosophers, the long established Idolatry of all Nations. Though the Princes of the Roman Empire endeavored to stop the Progress of the Gospel:—Though Priests and Politicians made
<PB N="72" REF="013514_0075_0F90F5E287F7F290"/>
use of all their Art and Address, to expose it to Contempt:—Though the Fires of Persecu∣tion consumed it's Professors, for three hun∣dred Years—it took deep Root, spread far and wide, and filled the whole Earth with it's salutary Influences.</P>
<P>WAS ever a Doctrine confirmed with such illustrious Attestations? What could support it, amidst so many Dangers; but the Divine Protection? What further Evidence can Men desire, that the Gospel is a Revelation from Heaven, and consequently, that Salvation may be obtained by Faith.</P>
<P>IF Men continue in Unbelief, it is to be ascribed to the corrupt Disposition of their Hearts, a fond Attachment to their criminal Delights.—A perpetual Engagement in the Business and Amusements of Life, prevents their receiving the <HI>Truth in the Love of it. If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this World hath blind∣ed the Minds of them that believe not, lest the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God should shine unto them.</HI></P>
<P>FROM this most terrible of all Judgments may God of his infinite Mercy deliver us.— To Him be Glory forever and ever. AMEN.</P>

<Q>—<HI>And that not of yourselves</HI>: IT IS THE GIFT OF GOD.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN the Posterity of <HI>Jacob</HI> were res∣cued from the Bondage of <HI>Egypt;</HI> it was a Type, of the more important Deliverance which God grants to His People from the Hands of their spiritual Enemies:— When the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> departed in Triumph, from the Land of their Oppressors; It was not in Consequence of the Battles they fought or the Victories they obtained: The LORD OF HOSTS marched at the Head of their Armies; an invisible Hand destroyed the Power of their Enemies:—When they passed through the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> they had neither Boats or Bridges to convey them to the opposite Shore; but God opened to them a Passage through the
<PB N="74" REF="013514_0077_0F90F5E3B01B52A8"/>
Bosom of the Deep; the fluid Element con∣trary to the established Laws of Nature, was a Defence to them, and proved the Destruction of their Assailants:—When they travelled for forty Years in an unhospitable Desart, they did not cultivate the Earth, or gather in a Har∣vest; they were fed with <HI>the Bread of Angels; Manna</HI> descended <HI>daily around their Camp, and the Rock poured out Water for</HI> their Refresh∣ment:—When to punish their Murmuring, God sent <HI>fiery Serpents</HI> among them, their deadly Wounds were healed, not by the Skill of Physicians, or the Virtue of Antidotes; a <HI>brazen Serpent</HI> was erected by divine Com∣mand; they look to the appointed Signal, and the Camp was restored to Health and Vigor: —When they crossed the River <HI>Jordan,</HI> they had no Conveniencies to secure their Passage; the mysterious <HI>Ark,</HI> the Symbol of the Divine Presence, arrested the Waters in their Course, the numerous Host passed over on dry Ground, and entered the Borders of the promised <HI>Ca∣naan.</HI>—When they obtained the peaceable Possession of that happy Land, it was not by <HI>their own Swords and Bows;</HI> but the <HI>Captain of the Lord's Host</HI> fought their Battles for them, inspired them with Conduct and Courage, and crowned them with Victory and Success.</P>
<P>THIS is a lively Representation of the Con∣duct of Heaven towards his <HI>spiritual Israel,</HI> in all Ages of the Church.—As God's ancient
<PB N="75" REF="013514_0078_0F90F5E48EFCE230"/>
People could not ascribe their Triumphs to the Number of their Armies, the Greatness of their Exploits, or their own Policy and Power: but to an Almighty Arm, which caused all Oppo∣sition to fall before them:—So the Redemp∣tion of the New-Testament Saints from the Slavery of Satan, cannot be attributed to the Powers of Nature, the Success of their own Endeavors; but to the Aids of supernatural Grace, which subdues the Strength of their ghostly Adversaries, and leads them on from <HI>conquering to conquer.</HI></P>
<P>THEREFORE, the Apostle having asserted, <HI>that by Grace we are saved through Faith,</HI> to remove all Ground of Boasting tells us in the Words now read—that this <HI>Faith is not of ourselves, it is the Gift of God.</HI> I am sensible these Words are referred by some to Salvation in general; which they acknowledge <HI>is not of ourselves but the Gift of God:</HI> But I think it is plainly the Design of the Apostle to apply these Words particularly to Faith. He had before established the Honor of divine Grace, in giving Salvation to Mankind, and declared that Faith was the Means of obtaining an In∣terest in it.—Now, to destroy all Pretentions to Pride, he teaches us, that this Faith is not a Grace that grows in the Garden of Nature, but is the Production of God.—This is evi∣dently the Doctrine of Religion.—A Divine Power <HI>opened the Heart of Lydia,</HI> to believe
<PB N="76" REF="013514_0079_0F90F5E778EF39D0"/>
the Preaching of <HI>St. Paul.</HI> When <HI>St. Peter</HI> acknowledges <HI>Jesus</HI> to be the SON OF GOD, our Lord immediately replies, <HI>Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona, for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</HI> These Texts, with many others which might be mentioned, establish beyond Dispute the Doctrine I am considering—<HI>That Faith is the Gift of God.</HI></P>
<P>IN my following Discourse I shall show— in what Sense Faith is the Gift of God—and then mention a few Particulars which illustrate and confirm this important Truth.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST, I AM to show in what Sense Faith is the Gift of God.</HEAD>
<P>MANY profess their Assent to this Propo∣sition—that <HI>Faith is the Gift of God</HI>—but mean no more, than that God gives a general and sufficient Grace to all Mankind, by virtue of which they may believe if they please, but are equally free to remain in Unbelief and Rebellion. According to this Scheme, Ability to believe comes from God, but actual Faith is properly to be ascribed to Man. After all the Influences with which he is favored, he determines himself with a sovereign and in∣dependent Freedom. This destroys the Di∣vinity of <HI>St. Paul,</HI> and supports the Fabric of human Pride: It makes Man, after all the
<PB N="77" REF="013514_0080_0F90F5E860126B30"/>
Compliments paid to Grace, the final Architect of his own Happiness.—But those who are taught in the School of Christ are inspired with different Sentiments. They are convinced that not only the Ability, but the inclination to believe, is one of <HI>those good Gifts which descend from the Father of Lights.</HI></P>
<P>BY the secret Illuminations of His Spirit, He discovers to us the Excellency and Beauty of a Savior, the Value and Importance of the Blessings He proposes to our Choice; by a gentle but effectual Influence He disposes us to accept the condescending Offer — If this were not the Case, with what Propriety could the Apostle propose that Question, <HI>who maketh thee to differ from another? What hast thou that that thou didst not receive?</HI>—The Believer might answer, with the strictest Propriety;— I have made the Difference; the good Improve∣ment I have made of my Free Will, hath distin∣guished me from the perverse and incredulous Part of Mankind.—"I adore the Most High God as the Father of my Spirit; I render Him my devout Acknowledgments that He made me a free Intelligence; I give Thanks to his Name▪ that He has favored me with the Light of the Gospel, and the kind Assistances of his Spirit —But these are common Favors, equally en∣joyed by all the Professors of the Gospel; they do not distinguish me from the hardned Sinner —That I believe—while others reject <HI>the Word
<PB N="78" REF="013514_0081_0F90F5E8F8437910"/>
of Life,</HI> is not the Gift of God, but must be ascribed to the Wisdom of my Choice, the good Disposition of my Heart."</P>
<P>WHOSE Heart would not tremble! What Tongue would not faulter to utter this pre∣sumptuous Language! I freely acknowledge those who remain in Unbelief, must impute it entirely to their Pride and Perverseness; their Love of this World and Attachment to their criminal Pleasures▪ But those who Believe must ascribe their Faith, to the effectual Operations of divine Grace.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<P>TO illustrate and confirm this Truth is what I proposed in the</P>
<P>SECOND Part of my Discourse.—To this End, let us consider—Our natural Inability to that which is Good—The Resistance Men generally make to the Operations of the Spirit —The Stratagems which Satan employs to keep them from Believing <HI>to the saving of their Souls.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. LET us consider our natural Inability, to that which is spiritually Good.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is declared in Scripture in the most expressive Terms, in a Variety of Forms. The God of Truth declares, <HI>that the Thoughts and Imaginations of the Heart of Man, are Evil, only Evil, and that continually.</HI> An inspired Pen
<PB N="79" REF="013514_0082_0F90F5EA7061D958"/>
informs us, <HI>that the carnal</HI> (i. e.) <HI>the unrenewed Mind, is not subject to the Law of God, nor can be: That the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God; for they are Fool∣lishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</HI></P>
<P>THE same mortifying Truth is taught by Metaphors, that it may be the more deeply engraven on our Minds:—Not to discourage, but humble us, with a View of our Wretched∣ness:—Not to fill us with imaginary Terrors, but alarm us sollicitously to seek a Cure.— We are represented as <HI>blind</HI> to divine Truths, till a celestial Ray shines upon our benighted Minds, and discovers to us their Excellency and Importance.—We are <HI>deaf</HI> to the Voice of incarnate Love, till a mighty Power remove the Obstructions, and incline our Ears to attend to the inviting Sound:—Our Hearts are like obdurate <HI>Rocks,</HI> impenetrable to every religious Impression, till victorious Grace softens them into <HI>Flesh,</HI> and makes them receptive of salu∣tary Impressions.—We are <HI>dead in Trespasses and Sins,</HI> till that irresistible Command, which must shortly awake the Inhabitants of the Grave, causes us to <HI>arise</HI> and <HI>live.</HI></P>
<P>THESE metaphorical Expressions are not the Flights of Fancy, but they convey a solemn Truth. No Language can be contrived, better adapted to represent our Inability, by any inhe∣rent
<PB N="80" REF="013514_0083_0F90F5EA92ABB578"/>
Power of our own, to do any Thing which is spiritually Good.—I am sensible that Meta∣phors ought not to be pressed into a Service, for which they were not originally designed;— at the same Time, I am sure they ought not to be explained away, till all their Sense, Propriety and Beauty is lost. If this Variety of Meta∣phors, so often repeated, does not teach us our spiritual Impotence to the Acts and Exercises of the divine Life, they signify Nothing,— They can be esteemed no better than extrava∣gant Hyperboles—which I am perswaded no serious Mind will impute to an inspired Author▪</P>
<P>But I proceed to show,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>II. THAT in our State of unregenerate Na∣ture, we are not only destitute of all Good, but resist the Influences of divine Grace.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN our Lord performed His miraculous Works, it was with uncontroulable Power; without the Aid of Means or Instruments.— In the first Creation, He issued out his autho∣ritative Fiat, this harmonious System immedi∣ately existed; nothing opposed the Execution of His Will.—When the Dead are raised, tho' they can contribute nothing to their own Re∣surrection, yet they form no Resistance to the all-quickning Power of the Son of God.— But when apostate Man is <HI>created anew;</HI> when the spiritually Dead are animated with a divine Life, they are not only destitute of all previous
<PB N="81" REF="013514_0084_0F90F5EB2E899300"/>
Disposition to Faith and Holiness, but disaf∣fected to the Sanctity of God, the Methods of His Grace, the Laws of His Government: They perversly reject the generous Hand, which is stretched out to recover them from their Guilt and Misery: They oppose the Opera∣tions of the sacred Spirit, which are designed to restore them, to the Favor and Image of God; to present Rectitude and future Happi∣ness.—Surely nothing short of a divine Power, can subdue the native Enmity of our Hearts, change the Bias of our depraved Inclinations, and reduce us to a Compliance with the ap∣pointed Way of Salvation. A Heart to re∣nounce our former Prejudices and Preposses∣sions; to submit to the Grace and Government of the BLESSED JESUS, must <HI>be the Gift of God.</HI> This will be further Evident—</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III. WHEN we take a View, of the innu∣merable Stratagems which Satan employs, to keep us from believing <HI>to the saving of our Souls.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS subtile Spirit is described in the Gospel under the Character of a <HI>strong Man,</HI> who having entered into an House, guards it against every Assault, and uses all Manner of Arts to maintain the Possession: Our victorious Re∣deemer must therefore bind this strong Man, before He can establish his Empire in the human Heart: It must be the Work of the omnipotent: God, and not of frail and feeble
<PB N="82" REF="013514_0085_0F90F5EBF319C980"/>
Man, to triumph over this terrible Enemy, to expel him from the Dominion he has im∣piously usurped, and as obstinately defends: He must be cast out with Violence, before the sanctifying Spirit can regain the peaceable Pos∣session of His Temple.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Israelites,</HI> were delivered from the Tyranny of <HI>Pharoah,</HI> with an <HI>high Hand and out-stretched Arm:</HI> But this Prince, in all the Pride and Plenitude of Power, was an in∣firm Mortal. It is therefore, a more illustrious Conquest, to rescue Mankind from the Capti∣vity▪ in which they are detained by the infer∣nal Tyrant of Hell. He is great in Strength, and has Legions of mighty and malicious Aux∣iliaries; who fight under his Standard, and assi∣duously promote the Designs of his accursed Empire. It is the sole Prerogative of the most high God, to dispossess <HI>the Prince of Darkness,</HI> and establish the Kingdom <HI>of Truth and Righte∣ousness,</HI> in a revolted World.

<PB N="83" REF="013514_0086_0F90F5ECDD5CB558"/>
has plunged the Race of Men! What Miracles of Power and Goodness are employed for our Recovery! How desirable was the Primitive State of Man!—An enlightned understanding taught him the Knowledge of God and his Duty; an uncorrupted Heart inclined him to pay a perfect Obedience to the Mandates of his Heavenly Father; the Way to unfailing Felicity was open to his View; every delight∣ful Enjoyment was in his Possession.</P>
<P>BUT alas! he rebell'd against God; a me∣lancholy Change immediately ensued: His Glory departed from him; the Privileges of his innocent Nature were forfeited forever: Darkness veiled his Mind; Pride and Perverse∣ness took Possession of his Heart; the Love of God was banished from his Breast, and Self-Love advanced to the Throne. Man, the Lord of this visible Creation, became an infamous Slave; the Favorite of his Maker a Captive of Hell: The Heavens were armed with Thunder, the Earth exposed to a lasting Curse: Every Thing conspired to make the ungrateful Rebel mortal and miserable.</P>
<P>WHAT Prodigies of Love prepared the Way for our Restitution to our former Happiness!

<P><PB N="84" REF="013514_0087_0F90F5F04F1E9B00"/>BUT this is not sufficient—Though the great Teacher of the Christian Church hath plainly directed us in the Way that leads to the Joys of Paradise—yet our Eyes are so daz∣zled with the Glories of this World, our Af∣fections so strongly attached to sensual Plea∣sures, our Minds so averse to every Thing which is Spiritual and Divine; that the same Good∣ness which discovers to us a Savior, must dis∣pose us to accept of Him in His sacred Offices and Characters: An Omnipotent Arm must be revealed to conquer our reluctant Nature, or we shall voluntarily persist in the Paths of Perdi∣tion.—If this is the Case—as it really is—how vain are all our Boasts of the Dignity and Ex∣cellency of our Nature, in its present depraved State! How ridiculous are all our Pretences to recommend ourselves to God, by our own Wisdom, Power or Goodness!</P>
<P>PROSTRATE thyself in the Dust, O fallen Creature! Know that thou art not only des∣picably Mean but inconceivably Vile.—To the all-penetrating Eye of God thou appearest, not only destitute of all recommending Qualities— but a Mass of Deformity.

<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>II. WHILE the Haughtiness of Man is obliged to stoop, the Excellency of Faith is clearly discovered.</HEAD>
<P>BY this we are recovered from Misery, re∣stored to the Favor of Heaven, conducted in the Way that leads to unfading Glory—All the Graces which reside in the Heart, all the Virtues which adorn the Life of a Christian, are the Offspring of Faith:—This secures us the final Victory over our spiritual Enemies:— By this we are supported in the most dange∣rous Trials, and enabled to persevere, in our Attachment to the Great Redeemer; <HI>till we receive the End of our Faith the Salvation of our Souls.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a Maxim of eternal Truth, <HI>whatsoever is not of Faith is Sin:</HI> We must then, inevita∣bly conclude, that without it, the most expen∣sive Charity, the most benevolent Disposition, the most assiduous Pravers, the severest Morti∣fications, the most amiable Virtues, are essen∣tially defective; destitute of Life and Spirit: They may establish a Reputation among Men; but will be pronounced Vain, at the enlightned Tribunal of God: They may gain the Advan∣tages of Time, but cannot secure the Blessings of Eternity.—If we <HI>are saved by Grace through

Faith;</HI> it necessarily follows, that they who are destitute of this Faith, are Strangers to that Grace, which forms the distinguishing Charac∣ter of the Heirs of Salvation, and consequently must be forever deprived of those Privileges which constitute the true Felicity and Glory of human Nature.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III. WITH what Ardor and Importunity should we seek to God for this important Gift.</HEAD>
<P>OUR Lord says to the <HI>Woman of Samaria, If thou knowest the Gift of God, thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living Water. Ask that ye may receive,</HI> was the Direction given by the same divine Teacher to the Multitude who attended on his Ministry.—This is the Voice of Reason, as well as the Command of God.—When sur∣rounded with distressing Dangers; when all created Help fails; when human Policy and Power discovers no Way of Escape; is it not natural?—is it not rational?—to prostrate our∣selves in the Dust, lift up our Eyes to Heaven, and implore those Almighty Aids which God takes Pleasure to communicate to the humble Supplicant. If our Hearts are too haughty— if our Knees are too stubborn—to bow at the Footstool of sovereign Grace, and ask the Life of our immortal Souls, surely our Damnation is of ourselves. It is Presumption to expect that God will vouchsafe to grant his choicest
<PB N="87" REF="013514_0090_0F90F5F1F67E7850"/>
Favors to those who proudly neglect to seek Him in the Ways of his own Institution. Has He erected a Throne of Grace in our revolted World? Does He command us by Prayer and Supplication to make known our Requests? and shall we live in the Neglect of so plain, positive and reasonable a Duty?—<HI>Should not a People seek unto their God?</HI>—a God who is the supreme Dispenser of Happiness and Misery—upon whose Goodwill depends our eternal Destiny. Does not the Honor of the Deity require that we look up continually to Him from whom <HI>alone our Help must come,</HI> and ardently implore that Mercy, without which we are the eternal Victims of inexora∣ble Justice?</P>
<P>ASK those, who <HI>live the Life of Faith</HI>—By what Methods were you introduced into this State?—They will answer with one Voice—"I was awakened to a solemn Concern for my eternal Welfare: <HI>I daily waited at Wisdom's Gates, and watched at the Posts of her Doors:</HI> I was convinced of the deep and universal Corruption of my Nature; I found that I was <HI>dead in Trepasses and Sins,</HI> that Nothing short of an Almighty Arm, could subdue my re∣luctant Heart, and induce me to a chearful Compliance with the Prescriptions of sovereign Mercy: I prostrated myself at the Feet of the supreme Disposer of Life and Death; I ac∣knowledged, I had forfeited every Favor, and that if He frowned me from his Presence for∣ever,
<PB N="88" REF="013514_0091_0F90F5F2B346DC90"/>
Justice must approve the Conduct; I had no Ground to complain that He treated me with undeserved Severity:—But I ardently im∣plored that Grace I had no Right to challenge, and earnestly deprecated the Execution of that Sentence which was the just Punishment of my Crimes.—He viewed me with a compassionate Eye, He hearkened to the Cries of my Distress, and stretched out his Arm to deliver me from the Depths of Misery.—He revealed unto me his gracious Nature, which revived my despond∣ing Heart:—He directed me by his Word and Spirit, to an All sufficient Savior provided for the greatest of Sinners:—He captivated me by the Charms of his Love, to resign myself to be his Servant forever."</P>
<P>IT is in this Way <HI>the Father of Mercies</HI> generally manifests Himself to the Sinners of human Race.—Thus <HI>he turns them from Dark∣ness to Light, from the Power of Sin and Satan unto God</HI>—Their Success should encourage us to walk in the same Way: Their Example should inspire us with unfainting Diligence to pursue the same Methods: Never should we desist, till we experience that <HI>Power from on High,</HI> which alone can form us into the Cha∣racter, and entitle us to the Privileges of <HI>the Sons of God.</HI></P>

<HEAD>IV. WHAT Gratitude should inspire the Breasts of those who are made Partakers of the Gift of Faith.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="89" REF="013514_0092_0F90F5F37A587A48"/>
IT was a pure Favor that brought us into Existence; but it is greater Kindness that be∣stows upon us Faith. Redeeming Love de∣mands an higher Song of Praise than creating Goodness.—How should we adore the Great∣ness of that Power, which not only made us at first—but designs to make us happy forever!— When we look up to JESUS <HI>who is the Author and Finisher of our Faith,</HI> our Hearts should overflow with Love, and our Tongues be per∣petually employed in thankful <HI>Hallelujahs.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN God delivered his People from <HI>Egypt,</HI> this Instance of the Divine Favor was to be com∣memorated in every succeeding Age: A Festival was appointed to perpetuate the Remembrance of it to the most distant Posterity.</P>
<P>BUT the Believer has a nobler Deliverance to commemorate.—God hath saved us not from a temporal Bondage, but an eternal Prison:—He gives us his Laws, not inscribed on <HI>Tables of Stone,</HI> but on the <HI>living Tables</HI> of our Hearts.—He directed the Marches of his ancient People, through an unhospitable De∣sart by <HI>a Pillar of Fire:</HI> He conducts his Saints in the present Day, by the Illuminations of his Spirit, who brings them safely, not to <HI>in earthly, but the celestial Canaan.</HI></P>
<P>LET us follow our divine Leader, with un∣daunted Courage, with chearful Perseverance. <HI>It is God that worketh in us to will and to do</HI>▪
<PB N="90" REF="013514_0093_0F90F5F4E9E2B3B8"/>
This, instead of incouraging Indolence, should animate our Zeal and Diligence.—The Teach∣ings of the divine Spirit shew us the Path of Holiness and incline us to walk in it.—The Allurements of Grace captivate our Hearts, and give us Life and Spirit to run the Way that leads to the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>TO animate us in this blessed Course, we are assured, that He who has begun a good Work in us, will <HI>carry it on to the Day of the Lord:</HI> He that hath given us Faith will in∣crease and perpetuate it.—He will revive our discouraged Hearts, and support our tottering Steps:—Though weak in ourselves, we shall be strong in <HI>the Power of his Might:</HI>—His Grace will be victorious in the midst of the fiercest Opposition.</P>
<P>NEITHER present Enjoyments nor future Prospects—Neither the Malice of Men, nor Subtilty of <HI>the Principalities and Powers of Darkness:</HI>—Neither the Charms of Life, nor Fears of Death—shall detach us from Him <HI>in whom we have believed:</HI> We may triumph in the Assurance, that <HI>He will keep that which is committed unto Him,</HI> till Faith shall be turned into Vision, and the Work of Grace completed in the Regions of Glory. To Him be Glory forever and ever. AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON VI. The Salvation we receive by Faith, UNSPEAKABLY GREAT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>HEBREWS II. 3.</BIBL>
<Q>How shall we escape, if we neglect so <HI>GREAT</HI> Salvation?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a just Reproach to Human Nature, that Men are so sollicitous to secure the In∣terests of the present Life, and so uncon∣cerned for their Happiness in a future World. With what Art and Address do they pursue their temporal Affairs! What Zeal and Dili∣gence do they employ to accomplish their Designs! New Plans are continually formed, to encrease their Estates and aggrandize their Families. If they fail of Success, it is not for Want of Inclination but Power.</P>
<P>WOULD to God, my Brethren, we were equally zealous in the Things which concern our immortal Welfare. But alas! to the eternal
<PB N="92" REF="013514_0095_0F90F5F5AD6D97C8"/>
Infamy of a great Part of Mankind, the Body engrosses all their Thoughts, their nobler Spirits are treated with astonishing Indifference; tran∣sitory Vanities confine their Views, eternal Realities are comparatively despised. This un∣happy Conduct degrades the Dignity of a reasonable Creature, and makes us resemble the Inferior Animals, who are under the entire Dominion of Sense.—We wonder not, that those Beings, who are only governed by In∣stinct; have no Views beyond the present Mo∣ment: But that Men, to whom the Almighty hath given Understanding, and designed for a future Existence, should be wise only for this perishing World, and disregard the supreme Happiness of their Nature—this is truly sur∣prising, and could not be believed, did not constant Experience evidence it to be a melan∣choly Truth.</P>
<P>THIS Conduct of Mankind is highly crimi∣nal, because it is voluntary and chosen; and it is as foolish as criminal, because it is attended with the most fatal Consequences: If not al∣tered, it inevitably involves us in extreme and eternal Misery. A Fool is generally esteemed one of the most contemptible Characters; but when it is involuntary it does not merit any Punishment.—But foolishly to neglect the ultimate End of our Being, that we may gratify our inferior Passions; of Choice to sacrifice our immortal Happiness to a few transitory

Advantages, involves us in aggravated Guilt, and exposes us to the severest Punishment.</P>
<P>THIS is that awful Truth, which is taught by <HI>St. Paul,</HI> in the Words of my Text— <HI>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great Salvation?</HI></P>
<P>THE Words contain two Propositions, which demand our solemn Attention—The Salvation provided for Sinners in the Gospel is unspeakably Great—They who neglect this great Salvation must inevitably perish.— I shall confine myself to the first of these in my present Discourse.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>THE Proposition at present to be confirmed is this—</P>
<P>THE <HI>Salvation</HI> provided for Sinners in the Gospel <HI>is unspeakably Great.</HI>—To evidence this let us consider—
<LIST>
<ITEM>THE Plan of this Salvation was formed in the eternal Counsels of Heaven.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IT was purchased with the Blood of the Son of God.</ITEM>
<ITEM>THE Mission of the Holy Ghost is pecu∣liarly designed to make us Partakers of this Salvation.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="94" REF="013514_0097_0F90F5F730D3ADF8"/>WHEN this happy Event takes place with respect to any of the Children of Men, it gives Joy to the Angels of Light.</ITEM>
<ITEM>WHEN others are excluded from it, the Spirits of Darkness triumph in their Ruin.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THUS God and his elect Angels—the Devil and his malicious Associates—conspire to evi∣dence the Greatness of that Salvation which is revealed in the Gospel.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>FIRST, The Plan of this Salvation was formed in the eternal Counsels of Heaven.</HEAD>
<P>MAN was originally the Favorite of his Almighty Creator: He gave him the first Place of Dignity in this visible World: He united Heaven and Earth, Matter and Spirit, in the Composition of human Nature: He introduced our first Parents into Being, in the most agreeable Circumstances, and bountifully provided for their Happiness in a State of Innocence.—But the All-seeing Eye of God, which penetrates into the most distant Futurities, beheld the un∣grateful Apostacy of Man, and formed the Design of his Recovery.—He determined that Satan should not triumph in his Success, nor the human Race be irrecoverably ruined.— Though perfectly happy in the Enjoyment of Himself, He did not behold with Indifference the Misery of Man. Though Millions of
<PB N="95" REF="013514_0098_0F90F5F8A8FDB6A0"/>
Worlds must have started into Being at his au∣thoritative Command, yet He looked with Compassion on this revolted Earth, and deter∣mined to disappoint the Devices of the Devil.</P>
<P>BUT the sublimest Spirits in Heaven would have been eternally at a Loss to find a Way, in which this benevolent Design could be accom∣plished, and the Honor of the Deity preserved. —The Demands of Justice must be answered, that Mercy may triumph in the Salvation of the Guilty—The Threatning of the Law must be fulfilled, that the Transgressor of it's righ∣teous Precepts may be pardoned.—The Dignity of the divine Government must be maintained, that condemned Rebels may be restored to Favor.—The righteous Governor of the Uni∣verse will evidence his Abhorrence of the Crime, while He receives the Criminal to the Embraces of his Love.</P>
<P>INFINITE Wisdom hath reconciled these Difficulties, and formed a Plan, which gives the brightest Discovery of all the Perfections of the Deity, sacredly maintains the Majesty of his Government, and displays the Riches of his Grace to his apostate Creatures.—In Confor∣mity to this Plan, the Son of God descends upon Earth in a human Form, fulfils the Law which we had violated, submits to bear the Punishment of our Crimes; and thus prepares the Way for our Approach unto God, as a
<PB N="96" REF="013514_0099_0F90F56749764978"/>
compassionate and reconciled Father.—Here we have the most admirable Display of divine Love, and the clearest Evidence of his Hatred to Sin: The Transgression of the Law is pu∣nished with awful Severity, and the Transgressor graciously forgiven. This is that mighty Pro∣jection, which is the Astonishment of Angels, and the Joy of the Redeemed. This gives us an affecting View of the inestimable Value of Salvation—Especially if we consider,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECONDLY, It was purchased by the Blood of the Son of God.</HEAD>
<P>IN all Ages, God has done great Things in Favor of his chosen People: For their Sakes, He exercises his Patience to a revolted World, and delays that important Period, when this visible Creation shall be consumed by Fire: For their Sakes, He hath counteracted the established Laws of Nature, and performed stu∣pendous Miracles, in the Sight of Angels and Men: For their Sakes He will shortly <HI>descend from Heaven with a Shout, with the Voice of the Arch-Angel and the Trump of God:</HI> From his radiant Throne He will publickly pronounce them his Friends and Favorites, and receive them to a <HI>Kingdom prepared for them from before the Foundation of the World.</HI> But that which raises the Value of all these signal Favors, is the inestimable Price, with which they are purchased. I know Nothing so
<PB N="97" REF="013514_0100_0F90F568B6937368"/>
incomprehensible to human Reason, as the Sa∣crifice of the Son of God for a guilty World. If this Mystery of divine Love had not been predicted by a Succession of inspired Prophets, confirmed by numerous and unquestionable Miracles, attested by Heaven and Earth, by Angels and Men—it could never be received as a Truth by any impartial Enquirer. It is difficult to conceive, that God would do so much for miserable Man. But since He has given us this surprising Discovery of his Love, we may justly infer the Greatness of that Hap∣piness which He designs for his redeemed People.</P>
<P>ELEVATE your Thoughts, my Brethren, above these Regions of Sense, ascend in your devout Contemplations to the Throne of the Eternal Deity; behold THE SON OF GOD <HI>shining in the Brightness of his Father's Glory,</HI> surrounded with Myriads of adoring Angels.— Then view Him, descending upon Earth, co∣vered with Wounds, bathed in Blood, nailed to the Cross, expiring in Death:—From the Dignity of his Person, learn the Value of his Sacrifice:—From the Severity of his Sufferings, learn the Greatness of his Purchase.—<HI>For us Men, and our Salvation,</HI> He appeared upon Earth <HI>in the Form of a Servant,</HI> passed through the Miseries of Life, and submitted to the Pains of Death. That Salvation, then, must be pronounced Great, which was procured at so
<PB N="98" REF="013514_0101_0F90F5696CFD1318"/>
great a Price. Our blessed Lord would not have forsaken the Pleasures of his Father's Bosom, parted with his heavenly Glory, and passed through this dark and distressing Scene of Sufferings, were it not to answer the most important Designs. He knew the just Value of Things, and esteemed the Happiness of his People an Equivalent for all the Sorrows of his Life and the Agonies of his Death.— Therefore we are assured that He shall <HI>see the Travail of his Soul and be satisfied.</HI> But fur∣ther to confirm this Point, we may consider,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THIRDLY, The Mission of the Holy Ghost is designed to make us Partakers of this Salvation.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN our blessed Lord finished his Work upon Earth and ascended to the Court of Hea∣ven, according to his Promise, He sent down his Holy Spirit, to convince the World of Sin, to deliver them from it's fatal Dominion, and form them to a Meetness for the Kingdom of Glory. Every faithful Subject of our adora∣ble Redeemer is <HI>justified in the Name of Jesus and sanctified by the Spirit of our God.</HI> This divine Agent not only favors the Church with an external Revelation, but secretly influences the Minds of Men to attend to the Truths delivered in the inspired Scriptures. He awa∣kens them to a Sense of their Danger while they continue in a State of Sin, animates them
<PB N="99" REF="013514_0102_0F90F56BDEF32050"/>
with a salutary Concern to <HI>fly from the Wrath to come</HI> —Though inconsiderate Sinners often resist his sacred Operations, and though a fond Attachment to their Lusts, reject the in∣dulgent Methods of divine Grace, he does not immediately abandon his Work, but waits upon them with admirable Patience, repeats his faithful Warnings, continues his friendly Offi∣ces, and strives with them, from Day to Day, from Year to Year.</P>
<P>THIS is his general Conduct to Mankind, under the Dispensation of the Gospel. Multi∣tudes, for their ungrateful Opposition to the Agency of the divine Spirit, are at last rejected of God, and left <HI>to consume away in their Ini∣quities.</HI> But with respect to the <HI>Elect,</HI> He continues his Influences, ceases not to strive with them, till their rebellious Hearts are con∣quered <HI>in the Day of his Power,</HI> and they are made the Triumphs of divine Love, the Heirs of immortal Glory—Having produced this happy Change, He watches over them with affectionate Care, enlightens them in Darkness, supports them in Weakness, recovers them from their Relapses, defends them in Dangers, and finally makes them victorious over all their spiritual Enemies. The Work which He has begun He will never forsake:—The Seed of Grace which He has implanted in their Hearts, He will cherish and encrease, till it produces the Fruits of Immortality and Glory.
<PB N="100" REF="013514_0103_0F90F56D53AAE980"/>
—Who can imagine the Holy Spirit would be so sedulously employed to secure the Sal∣vation of Mankind, were it not an Affair of the greatest Importance. That must be of inestimable Value, which is accomplished at such an infinite Expence. It is dishonourable to suppose, that God should send his Son from the Regions of Glory; that the Son should humble himself to the Dust of Death, that the Spirit should employ his Almighty Energy, and not have in view the noblest Designs.</P>
<P>I add,</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>FOURTHLY, When any of the Children of Men are made Partakers of this Salvation, it gives Joy to the Angels of Light.</HEAD>
<P>THESE benevolent Spirits, with a disinter∣ested Joy, congratulated the first Appearance of a Savior in this lower World; they attended Him through all the Sorrows of Life; they comforted Him at the Approaches of Death; they appeared in Robes of celestial Glory to adorn the Triumphs of his Resurrection; they accompanied Him with joyful Acclamations in his Ascent to the Kingdom of his Father.— Though they are illustrious Courtiers of Hea∣ven, they do not think the Inhabitants of this Earth beneath their Notice: Though they are the most exalted Part of the Creation, they disdain not to maintain an Intercourse with Worms of the Dust:—When <HI>a Sinner is con∣verted
<PB N="101" REF="013514_0104_0F90F56E98EEF710"/>
from the Error of his Ways,</HI> the glad Tidings are propagated through the heavenly Mansions: <HI>There is Joy in the Presence of the Angels of God,</HI> that an Addition is made to the happy Society above: They chearfully forsake their Thrones of Glory, to become <HI>ministring Spirits to those who are appointed Heirs of Salvation:</HI> They <HI>encamp about the Dwellings of</HI> the Saints, deliver them from numberless Dangers, and by a Thousand Offices of Kind∣ness, support and encourage them in their Passage through the Wilderness of this World. When the People of God have finished their Work upon Earth, they surround their dying Beds, receive their departing Spirits, guard them from the malignant Powers of Darkness, conduct them through the Regions of the Air, and safely introduce them into the <HI>Paradise of God.</HI>—Thus the Soul of the despised <HI>Lazarus</HI> was <HI>carried by Angels into Abraham's Bosom.</HI> —Thus the Soul of every faithful Servant of Christ, when delivered from the Body, becomes the Charge of these heavenly Ministers.—Nor do they desist from their Care, till they have fixed it in these happy Abodes, where it is secure from every Danger.—Surely that Sal∣vation must be great, which these exalted Beings so affectionately desire to promote: They would not willingly leave the rapturous Employments of Heaven, to secure a trifling Advantage. Inconsiderate Mortals may despise this Salvation, but it is highly esteemed by
<PB N="102" REF="013514_0105_0F90F570094D5130"/>
those wise and holy Beings, who live in the Light of the Divine Countenance, and cannot be mistaken in the true Value of Things.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>FIFTHLY. While the Angels rejoice, when any are made Partakers of this Salvation, the Devils triumph, when any by their Fault and Folly are excluded from it.</HEAD>
<P>THE Devil is always represented as the Enemy of God and Goodness. Having de∣serted his exalted Station, he envies the Happi∣ness of Mankind. Condemned to the Punish∣ment of eternal Death, he seeks with incessant Malice to involve others in the same irremedi∣able Ruin.—To accomplish this accursed De∣sign, he employs every Art, and exercises in∣defatigable Diligence.—While Men go on securely in the Ways of Sin, he flatters them with Hopes of Impunity, rocks them asleep by a thousand deceitful Suggestions, that they may be insensible of their Misery and Danger. —If at any Time their guilty Fears are alarmed, he hurries them into the Business and Amuse∣ments of Life; that they may divert their un∣easy Thoughts. He employs their gay Com∣panions, by Banter and Ridicule, to erase all serious Impressions from their Minds.—If a Sense of Guilt abide upon their Consciences, he terrifies them with unreasonable Fears, that the Day of Grace is ended, or that if they give way to their present Impressions, they must bid
<PB N="103" REF="013514_0106_0F90F03AAE26B668"/>
Adieu to every pleasant Enjoyment, and con∣demn themselves to perpetual Melancholy.— If all these Attempts are in vain, and we are effectually perswaded to give up ourselves to our compassionate Savior, even then he does not abandon his malicious Designs. When he cannot prevent our Happiness, he endeavours to disturb our Peace: When he cannot regain the Empire of our Hearts, he industriously strives to pollute our Persons and Performances: He follows us to <HI>the Altar of God,</HI> and by a Variety of Temptations, interrupts our Com∣munion with Heaven: He pursues us to the Gates of <HI>Paradise,</HI> and never ceases to distress us, till we enter that blessed World from which he is forever excluded.—Now, what is it that animates Satan and his confederate Hosts to employ all their Power and Policy to destroy Mankind?—They envy us the Enjoy∣ment of that Heaven from which they are righteously banished: Their Malice is so great, that it increases their Torment to behold others rejoicing in the Favor of God, when they are condemned to an eternal Departure from Him.</P>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured to give you some View of the Greatness of that Salvation which is revealed in the Gospel.—It is great in the Judgment of Heaven and Hell.—The Good∣ness of God and the Malice of Satan—<HI>the Angels of Light</HI> and the Ministers of <HI>Darkness</HI> —all conspire to proclaim it's Excellency and Value.</P>
</DIV3>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<P>I. IS it not then astonishing Madness, to forfeit this Salvation for the meanest Trifles? And yet, O my Brethren, to the Disgrace of the Christian Name, this is a common Practice. We daily behold Souls capable of the extatic Joys of Heaven, confining their Pursuits to the defiling Pleasures of this degenerate Earth. We daily behold Souls formed for the Society of Angels deserting the Throne of Reason, and transformed into the Likeness of savage Brutes. They renounce the Happi∣ness for which they were originally designed, and think and act, as if they were made for no higher an End—than to delight their Eyes with splendid Prospects—to gratify their Ears with the Harmony of Sounds—To please their Taste with the Flavor of Meats and Drinks— and after having spent a few Years in these sensual Pleasures, to retire off the Stage and be insensible forever.</P>
<P>IS this to act agreeable to the Character of Man, whom God appointed Lord of this lower Creation; who was formed after the Image of the Deity; who was placed upon Earth to glorify his Maker, and be eternally happy in the Enjoyment of his Love?—Are we capable of the Joys of Angels, and shall we associate with the Beasts that perish?—Were we de∣signed to imitate the moral Perfections God,

the best of BEINGS, and shall we degrade ourselves to a Resemblance of the Devil, the most hateful of <HI>Creatures?</HI>—Awake, O Man I from this State of Infatuation. Arise, consider the Greatness of your Folly. You are indeed fallen from your primitive Excellency; your Nature is corrupted in all it's Powers. But God has formed a Plan for the Recovery of the apostate Race of <HI>Adam:</HI> Christ has died for their Salvation: The Spirit is sent down to operate on the Minds of Men, and transform them into <HI>New-Creatures:</HI> Shall the Love of God be despised—the Merits of Christ under∣valued—the Influences of the Holy Ghost be resisted—and you perish at last, notwithstanding the Miracles of divine Grace for your Reco∣very?—Had you rather Devils should triumph in your Ruin, than Saints and Angels rejoice in your Salvation?</P>
<P>YOU will doubtless say—God forbid this should be my Case.—But allow me to assure you, this must be your inevitable Destiny—if you neglect your immortal Concerns—spend your Time in the Vanities and Diversions of Life—disregard the Service of your Maker and Sovereign—live in those Sins against which the Wrath of Heaven is denounced —There is no Medium—Every one of you must be perswaded to give up yourselves to the compassionate <HI>Jesus</HI>; experience his saving Power rescuing you from the Dominion

of Sin; and be made Partakers of the sancti∣fying Influences of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI>; or remain under the Wrath of God, and suffer the Dam∣nation of Hell through immortal Ages.</P>
<P>FOR what do Mankind neglect their eternal Interest? A Stranger to human Nature must suppose it must be for something of inestimable Value.—No—It is for the Pleasures of an in∣temperate Hour, for the Joys of a lascivious Moment, for the fordid Gains of Avarice, for the childish Amusements which take place on this Theatre of Vanity.—For these Heaven is renounced, Hell is chosen.</P>
<P>SUFFER not, O my Brethren, <HI>the God of this World</HI> to blind your Eyes; attend to <HI>the one Thing needful.</HI></P>
<P>WERE we condemned to perish without Remedy, it would be cruel to attempt to di∣sturb your present Repose—Were the <HI>great Salvation</HI> unattainable by the Children of Men, all Exhortations to secure it would be imperti∣nent and absurd. But this World is the Region of Hope: While we reside upon Earth we are Candidates for an heavenly Inheritance: Pro∣posals of Grace are made to Sinners of every Order and Character: They are both invited and commanded to accept the Great Salvation. —Those who are involved in the deepest Guilt, and pining away in Indigence and Misery,
<PB N="107" REF="013514_0110_0F90F03B6D2AF530"/>
are to be compelled, by all the perswasive Charms of divine Grace, by every Argument that can gain the Attention and Influence the Choice of a rational Creature, to accept of Life and Happiness.—It was our Wants, and not our Worthiness, that engaged our heavenly Father to form the Plan of our Redemption — It is to extricate us out of Misery, and not to reward our Virtues, that a Savior is provided for us. The only Qualification a Sinner can have antecedent to an Union to Christ, is a deep Sense of his Misery, a Despair of all Relief in himself, a Willingness to receive a Supply of all his Wants from the Fountain of all Good.—Therefore, <HI>Whosoever will</HI>—is the Language of eternal Love. It is an undoubted Truth, that none perish under the Advantages of the Gospel, but in consequence of their own voluntary Choice: By a positive Act of their Wills they reject Christ and the important Blessings He offers to their Acceptance: He refuses None that rely on his Power and Grace; but affectionately calls all <HI>weary and heavy laden Sinners to come to Him,</HI> and kindly pro∣mises, <HI>I will give you Rest.</HI>—The whole Num∣ber of Believers on Earth, and the radiant Assembly of glorified Saints in Heaven, bear their united Testimony to this consolatory Truth.—In the Character of guilty Creatures they cast themselves down at the Feet of an Almighty Savior: encouraged by the unlimit∣ed Calls of his Word, they committed their

future Welfare to his Care: He extended the <HI>Sceptre of his Mercy,</HI> and said unto them LIVE. Their Example should revive the Spi∣rit of every trembling Sinner, and encourage them, from the Depths of Distress and Misery to confide in that Savior who is <HI>the same Yesterday, To-day, and forever.</HI></P>

<HEAD>II. WITH what Gratitude should we em∣brace this Great Salvation?</HEAD>
<P>IF the <HI>King of Kings</HI> hath published a royal Proclamation, inviting his rebellious Sub∣jects to return to their Allegiance and receive, not only a free Pardon, but the Dignity and Privilege of Favorites—We may be assured, without Danger of Deception, that those who obey the Call, shall obtain the promised Mercy. —It is beneath the Character of the Deity, to amuse his Creatures with imaginary Hopes, or disappoint the Expectations of those who rely on his faithful Word. <HI>The Strength of Israel will not lie:</HI> The immutable <HI>Jehovah</HI> will not repent of the Purposes of his Love.</P>
<P>To confirm our Faith, we may take a View of the Conduct of our divine Master, when he condescended to be an Inhabitant of this inferior Earth: None were rejected, that ap∣plied to Him in their Distress:—All were re∣lieved that came to Him in the Language of humble Faith. The most despicable Objects
<PB N="109" REF="013514_0112_0F90F03C2D86A9C0"/>
were received with condescending Goodness, and restored to Health and Vigor by the Greatness of his Power. The vilest Sinners were delivered from the Dominion of their infamous Lusts, and assured of the Forgiveness of their aggravated Crimes.—He is now the same mighty and compassionate Savior He ever was: The Dignity to which He is advanced, has neither diminished his Power, or abated his generous Concern for the Welfare of Mankind: —He is equally willing to hearken to the sup∣plicating Voice of his distressed Creatures— equally willing to deliver them from their Guilt and Danger.</P>
<P>WHO can dispute his Power, when all Nature obeys his Laws, and the most perfect Orders of Creatures are governed by the Direction of his Will!—Who can question his Readiness to apply his Power to relieve those who confide in Him!—Behold! the Sufferings He endured —the Blood He shed—the Death He under∣went for the Salvation of a guilty World:— Every Wound discovers the Compassions of his Heart; His expiring Agonies purchased eternal Redemption for all who place their Trust in Him.</P>
<P>HE was <HI>once lifted up on an</HI> infamous <HI>Cross,</HI> and is <HI>now exalted to a Throne of Glory,</HI> to evidence that He is <HI>able to save to the uttermost all that come to God by Him.</HI>—Those there∣fore
<PB N="110" REF="013514_0113_0F90F03CED14BDB0"/>
<HI>who look unto Him,</HI> and receive Salvation as his Gift, are sure of a welcome Reception. —Their Safety is deposited in Almighty Hands:—Neither human Weakness or Folly, or the Opposition of the Powers of Darkness, shall be able to effect their Ruin.—Here is the great Security of every true Believer: The Power and Fidelity of Christ is engaged for their Protection:—They may bid Adieu to all uneasy Fears, and banish all disquieting Suspi∣cions from their Minds:—Their Hopes are built on the <HI>Rock of Ages.</HI>—The Sun shall grow dim with Age, the bright Luminaries of Heaven be extinguished—the Earth we inhabit evaporate in Smoke:—But the <HI>Savior lives,</HI> inthron'd in Majesty and Might, to support the Hopes, and perpetuate the Happiness of those who are committed to his Care.— To Him be Glory forever and ever.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON VII. Those who neglect this Great Salvation must inevitably perish.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>HEBREWS II. 3.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>HOW SHALL WE ESCAPE,</HI> if we neglect so great Salvation?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE most generous Medicines, if they do not answer the End for which they were administred, often exasperate the Disease, and render the Circumstances of the Patient more dangerous: In like Manner, the Gospel, which is designed to restore Mankind to spiritual Health, if it does not produce the desired Effect, is attended with the most preju∣dicial Consequences. If the Methods of Divine Grace are despised they involve us in aggra∣vated Guilt, and end in irrecoverable Misery. The Punishment of Infidels, who enjoy the Light of Revelation, will be infinitely more ter∣rible than that which shall be inflicted on un∣instructed
<PB N="112" REF="013514_0115_0F90F5741BF67280"/>
Pagans. THE SON OF GOD, whom they despise, no longer resides upon Earth in a State of Poverty and Meanness; but is ascended above the visible Heavens, and sways the Sceptre of the Universe. The once despised GALI∣LEAN is seated on a Throne of Light, Angels prostrate themselves at His Feet, and Devils tremble at the Terrors of His Wrath. He has Crowns of Glory to reward His faithful Sub∣jects, and a glittering Sword to destroy His im∣placable Enemies.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, we find the Misery of the wicked was never painted in more terrible Co∣lours, than by that divine Messenger, who <HI>came not to condemn the World, but that the World through Him might be saved.</HI> The <HI>Apostles,</HI> who imitated their blessed Master, perswaded Men, by <HI>the Terrors of the Lord not to receive the Grace of God in Vain.</HI></P>
<P>THE inspired Author in my Text, repre∣sents those <HI>who neglect the great Salvation,</HI> as condemned to inevitable Destruction.—<HI>How shall we Escape,</HI> &amp;c. These Words are an In∣ference from the Severity which attended the legal Dispensation. <HI>If the Word spoken by An∣gels was stedfast, and every Transgression and Disobedience received a just Recompence of Re∣ward, how shall we escape,</HI> &amp;c.—The Rea∣soning is conclusive—the Threatning it contains should inspire us with awful Fear, lest it be
<PB N="113" REF="013514_0116_0F90F5758C810CC0"/>
executed upon us. The Law pronounced Sen∣tence of Death upon the presumptuous Trans∣gressor: The Man who violated the Sanctity of <HI>the Sabbath</HI> was immediately stoned: Many Thousand <HI>Israelites</HI> were destroyed in one Day for their idolatrous Practices. The Apostle assures us, that severer Punishments are ap∣pointed for the profane Despisers of the Gospel —<HI>How shall they escape</HI>—This Method of Expression declares, that to escape is a vain Expectation—an impossible Attempt.</P>
<P>THOSE who neglect the great Salvation of the Gospel must inevitably perish.—To evi∣dence this, I shall show—This is the Sentence pronounced upon them by impartial Justice— God has Power to execute this Sentence— Mercy has provided no Way of Relief.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST, THE Sentence of inevitable De∣struction is pronounced upon the Despisers of the Gospel by the Justice of God.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the positive Determination of the su∣preme and uncontroulable Sovereign of the World—<HI>He that believeth not shall be damned.</HI> This Sentence is fixed in the immutable Decree of God, and will be executed in the appointed Time. By Sin Man is become an Enemy to God, and if he persists in his Rebellion, Justice must triumph in his final Destruction. God beholds his unhappy Offspring with Pity; He
<PB N="114" REF="013514_0117_0F90F5762D762F00"/>
proposes Terms of Peace; He sends his Am∣bassadors to proclaim the glad Tidings to a guilty World: Astonishing Love!—Is it not daring Impiety to refuse the great God an Hearing?—Is it not inexcusable Insolence to reject his Proposals?—This is the Practice of Multitudes—They presumptuously despise his Grace:—This is plainly to declare, that they value not his Friendship, nor fear the Terrors of his Wrath.—It is fit such obstinate Rebels should abide by the Consequence of their own Choice.—They <HI>judge themselves unworthy of Life eternal,</HI> and are justly condemned to suffer the Pains of eternal Death.</P>
<P>HAD divine Goodness signified his Intention to mitigate the Sentence of his righteous Law, or grant a temporary Suspension of the deserved Punishment, it must have been acknowledged a Favor, and ought to be received with Grati∣tude:—But He proclaims complete Deliverance to the Captives of Hell—A Deliverance not to be purchased by us, but thankfully received.— This contains a Freedom from all the Miseries we feel or fear—A perfect and perpetual En∣joyment of every desirable Good.—Now, must not they perish, who are unwilling to be saved?—Should not they remain under Guilt, who refuse the Offer of a Pardon?</P>
<P>MEN may please themselves with unground∣ed Surmises; but God will not suffer his Laws
<PB N="115" REF="013514_0118_0F90F03DAE714070"/>
to be violated—His Grace abused—His Justice insulted—His Glory eclipsed, that obstinate Transgressors may escape with Impunity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SECONDLY, IF impartial Justice pronounces the Sentence, the sovereign Ruler has Power to put it in Execution.</HEAD>
<P>THIS none can dispute who believe the Existence of a God. He who made the World by a Command, can destroy it in a Moment with a Frown. His Power is supreme and indepen∣dent: Nothing can alter his Purposes, or resist the Execution of his Will: His Smiles diffuse Life and Joy through all the Inhabitants of Heaven: His wrathful Presence fills the Regions of Hell with Darkness, Terror and Despair.</P>
<P>MEN often escape the Stroke of human Justice, by Art and Address: They may fly from the Power of the mighty Monarchs of the Earth, and find a Retreat beyond the Limits of their Jurisdiction: Death always removes us out of their Reach; the Effects of their Anger cannot enter the Repository of the Grave:— But whither shall we flee from God! To what Part of the Universe can we escape and be free from his Arrests! Death itself conveys us in∣to his immediate Presence, and delivers us up, the helpless Victims of his Vengeance.</P>
<P>IF indeed the Dissolution of the Body was the Destruction of the Soul, we might neglect
<PB N="116" REF="013514_0119_0F90F03E6D6F68A0"/>
the Salvation of the Gospel, and escape all future Punishment: But to suppose this, is to contradict the Voice of Reason, the Testimony of Conscience, the unerring Orcles of Truth. That the Soul of Man is immortal, is a Doctrine of natural and revealed Religion.—The ancient Philosophers were inspired with this Hope.— Jesus Christ hath confirmed it by express De∣clarations and astonishing Miracles. The Soul is not formed of the Dust, but immediately de∣rived from the Great <HI>Father of Spirits.</HI> The Body is a beautiful Fabrick, finished with con∣summate Art; but animated, directed and moved by the immortal Mind: The Body is composed of different Parts, and may be de∣stroyed by innumerable Accidents; but the Soul is a simple uncompounded Substance, not liable to a Dissolution. These are strong Pre∣sumptions in Favor of this important Truth.— But that which Reason pronounces probable, revealed Religion declares to be certain. The System of the Gospel is built on this Founda∣tion: They who deny it not only reject the <HI>Religion of Jesus,</HI> but are Enemies to the Peace and good Order of civil Society.—They oppose those Sentiments which are common to all, except the most abandoned of the human Race, and level themselves with the Beasts that perish. Not only the Philosophers of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Athens,</HI> but <HI>Barbarians</HI> and <HI>Scythians,</HI> will rise up against them and condemn them.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="013514_0120_0F90F03F2D02A0F8"/>IF the Soul exists in a future State, it per∣ceives and acts, for these are essential to its Nature; and therefore it is capable of Rewards and Punishments. The God of Truth assures us, that when <HI>the Body</HI> descends into <HI>the Dust, the Soul returns to God that gave it.</HI>—To God—to triumph in his Love, or to experience the Effects of his severe Displeasure:—While those who embrace the great Salvation, <HI>enter into the Joy of their Lord,</HI> they who despise and neglect it must suffer <HI>eternal Destruction from the Presence of the Lord and the Glory of his Power.</HI>—If the Justice of God hath pronounced Sentence against them—if He has Power to execute this Sentence—there can be no Hope of Escape, except some Method is appointed for their Deliverance. This brings me to say,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THIRDLY, MERCY hath provided no Way of Relief for those who neglect this Salvation.</HEAD>
<P>DIVINE Compassion hath instituted a Way of Recovery;—this they reject;—the Conse∣quence is, they are deprived of all Hope, and must perish without Remedy.—After Man had violated the Law, the Grace of the Gospel was revealed:—Otherwise the Mercy of God must have been forever concealed; the most illustri∣ous Triumphs of unlimited Goodness could never have been displayed. The Sufferings and Sacrifice of the Son of God in the Room
<PB N="118" REF="013514_0121_0F90F5795CB3B3B8"/>
of condemned Man, was the highest Evidence of the Divine Benevolence, and will be celebrat∣ed with Transports of Gratitude, through un∣ceasing Ages.—But if this Love is undervalued, if Mercy is insolently despised, and the great Sacrifice for Sin rejected; there remains no Re∣source; the Criminal is placed beyond all pos∣sibility of Pardon.—To what Sanctuary will he fly? The Law pronounces the terrible Sentence, Justice demands immediate Execution, and in∣sulted Mercy increases the Severity of the Punishment.</P>
<P>SHALL Christ again descend from the Throne of Glory, and <HI>Tabernacle in Flesh?</HI> Shall the Prince of Life again submit to the Stroke of Death; that the Despisers of His Merits and Righteousness may be saved? No.—The Scrip∣tures positively assure us, <HI>that henceforth He dieth no more</HI>; He hath finished his Work, and they who believe not must perish forever.</P>

<P>I. WHAT Multitudes deceive themselves with ungrounded Hopes of Salvation!— Ask them, do you expect to be saved?—They
<PB N="119" REF="013514_0122_0F90F57A8A5A6BD0"/>
answer without Hesitation—Yes.—Upon what Foundation is your Expectation built?—Is the Salvation revealed in the Gospel the most de∣sirable Blessing in their Esteem?—No.—They have a greater Affection to the Pomps and Plea∣sures of this Life.—Do they seek after an In∣terest in this Salvation with unremitting Dili∣gence?—No.—They spend their Days i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worldly Cares and Diversions.—Have they re∣ceived <HI>Power from on High,</HI> to mortify their dearest Lusts?—No.—They go on securely in the prohibited Paths of Vice.—Do they aspire after that Holiness, without which the Scripture declares no Man shall enter into the <HI>New Jeru∣salem?</HI>—No.—This would lay too severe a Restraint on their Nature, and deprive them of their chiefest Joys.—What Reason have you then to hope for future Happiness?—You flat∣ter yourselves that God is merciful, and will not be so strict as He is represented in his Word.</P>
<P>AH fatal Delusion!—prodigious Folly!— Would you venture your Estate or Reputation on chimerical Hopes, destitute of all Founda∣tion either in Reason or Scripture?—If there was any other Dispensation of Grace, besides that which is revealed in the Gospel—If there was any other Sacrifice for Sin, than that which <HI>the Son of God</HI> finished on the Cross— If there was any other Way to Heaven, than that which is traced out by the Precepts and and Example of our blessed Savior—there
<PB N="120" REF="013514_0123_0F90F03FECF33B90"/>
might be some Foundation for Hope: But if <HI>there is no other Name given under Heaven by which Men can be saved but the Name of Jesus</HI>;—if none are accepted at the supreme Tribunal, but through his all sufficient Righ∣teousness;—if the everlasting State of Mankind must be determined according to the Gospel;— then your Expectations of future Happiness are an imaginary Dream: In the End you <HI>die a Fool,</HI> and <HI>must lie down in</HI> everlasting <HI>Sorrow.</HI></P>
<P>DO you dispute this? Then you rase the Foundations of Religion and treat the Gospel as if <HI>it was a cunningly devised Fable</HI>—Do you believe <HI>Moses and the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles?</HI>—I trust, without paying a Compliment to my Hearers, I may address them as St. Paul did King Agrippa—<HI>I know that you believe.</HI>—What then remains, but that you bow to the Authority of divine Revelation, and receive the most mysterious Doctrines with humble Submission.</P>
<P>IF our corrupt Reason is to be advanced to the infallible Chair, and the Articles of Religion are to be explained according to it's Dictates, many of it's sublimest Truths will be pronounc∣ed false, and it's self-denying Precepts accom∣modated to the Genius of a degenerate Age.</P>
<P>MEN of Pleasure cannot conceive that God will be so severe, as to punish them for the
<PB N="121" REF="013514_0124_0F90F040ACF2AB08"/>
Gratification of their sensual Appetites and Inclinations:—I, my Brethren, if I only con∣sult my Reason, cannot conceive that He should be so indulgent to his guilty Creatures, as daily Experience evidences He is—Nothing can be more incredible to our finite Reason, than that the Monarch of the Universe should send his Son to give his Life a <HI>Ransom</HI> for his rebellious Subjects—That the immaculate <HI>Jesus should bear the Punishment of our Sins in his own Body on the Tree:—That He should be wound∣ed for our Transgressions, bruised for our Ini∣quities, and the Chastisement of our Peace be upon Him.</HI>—But God speaks, let every mortal Ear attend; let human Reason be silent, and devoutly acknowledge it's Incapacity to com∣prehend the Depths of the divine Counsels.— My Faith adores this mysterious Love—my Heart acquiesces with Joy in the salutary Truth —<HI>I receive it as a faithful Saying and worthy of all Acceptation.</HI></P>
<P>BUT why should it be esteemed unreason∣able, that Men who obstinately persist in their Crimes, should <HI>reap the Fruit of their own Doings?</HI> What more equitable, than that they who will not accept of Mercy, should fall by the Sword of Justice?</P>
<P>EVERY inlightened Mind, instead of com∣plaining of the Severity of God, will adore his Patience to a revolted World. While Sinners
<PB N="122" REF="013514_0125_0F90F57BF949AA28"/>
continue in Arms of Rebellion against Him, He visits them every Morning with his refresh∣ing Light, provides for them every Day with paternal Care, showers down Blessings upon them with an unsparing Hand.—Why do not the Thunders of Heaven destroy those insolent Mortals, who defy their Omnipotent Maker! Why does not the Earth open it's Mouth and transmit to unquenchable Flames those anda∣cious Rebels, who will not submit to the Go∣vernment of <HI>of the King of Kings! It is because his Ways are not as our Ways, neither his Thoughts as our Thoughts—He is long-suffering to us ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should be brought to Re∣pentance.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>II. HOW greatly is it to be lamented, that the Bulk of Mankind pay so little Atten∣tion to that which ought to engage their principal Concern!</HEAD>
<P>LET us view the Conduct of Men: How carelessly do they spend their Time, in the Fatigues of Business, or the Pursuit of Plea∣sure! They dissipate their Thoughts upon a thousand Objects, and live without Retirement or Reflexion.—They contemplate these visible Heavens and measure the Magnitude, and cal∣culate the Distance of the Stars; but give themselves no Concern to secure an Entrance into the <HI>Heaven of Heavens,</HI> the Habitation
<PB N="123" REF="013514_0126_0F90F57C357FC918"/>
of God's favorite People.—They descend into the Depths of the Earth, to discover the Treasures which are concealed in it's Bosom; but never seriously prepare for that decisive Hour, when they shall have no more Con∣nection with this material System, but become Inhabitants of the invisible World of Spirits —Borne on the Wings of Ambition or Avarice, they fly from Pole to Pole, in Search of that Wealth and Honor which vanisheth in a Moment; but profanely despise that <HI>Honor which comes from God</HI>—those Treasures which would inrich them forever.</P>
<P>THIS careless and sensual Course of Life might perhaps admit of some Excuse, if at∣tended with no hurtful Consequences; but since it is inconsistent with all regular Hopes of Salvation; since, if not awakned out of it, we remain the Children of Wrath; every considerate Mind must condemn Sinners of this Order, as the greatest of Madmen.</P>
<P>WHAT would you think of a Prisoner con∣fined in Chains, who knew the Day of his Trial was approaching, that Sentence of Death was ready to be pronounced upon him; and when once pronounced could never be recalled, but would certainly be executed:—If in this melancholy Situation he was assured that a Way of Escape was provided:—But instead of improving the Opportunity afforded him, he
<PB N="124" REF="013514_0127_0F90F09C2E966C10"/>
disregarded the Message, and spent his Time in Sports and Diversion, till the fatal Hour arrive which excludes all Hopes forever!— Would not every impartial Observer pronounce his Conduct the Extremity of Madness?</P>
<P>THIS is but a faint Image of the Madness which possesses the Hearts of secure Sinners.— As much as the Punishment of Hell is to be dreaded above the momentary Miseries of this Life, so much greater is the Folly of those who neglect <HI>the Day of their Visitation.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR Folly will be still more manifest if we consider—what Motives induce them to so fatal a Procedure.—Motives so mean and contemptible, that it is astonishing they have any Influence upon Men endowed with the Powers of Reason and Reflection. The true Happiness of our Nature is sacrificed for a few sordid Delights, which become insipid by Custom, are impaired by the Infirmities of Age, and will certainly be lost in Death.</P>
<P>DOUBTLESS <HI>the Angels of Light</HI> are asto∣nished at the Stupidity of Men, who for a painted Toy—a little Heap of glittering Dust —or a sensual Pleasure, which they enjoy in common with their kindred Brutes, part with Heaven and it's unceasing Joys, expose them∣selves to Hell, and all it's dark and despairing Horrors. In the mean time, in perfect Con∣sistence
<PB N="125" REF="013514_0128_0F90F57CF48459E8"/>
with the Hopes of eternal Happiness, we might enjoy every rational Pleasure. The Enjoyments of this World, when regulated by the Precepts of Religion, are attended with peculiar Sweetness—We review them without Reproach—and receive them as Ear∣nests of superior Joys.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>III. LET us then be perswaded to renounce this inconsiderate Conduct, and with unfainting Vigor and Resolution pur∣sue those Blessings which constitute our Happiness in Time and Eternity.</HEAD>
<P>HAVE you hitherto neglected to walk in the Way that leads to Life?—Have you spent your Time in those Things which the wise <HI>Solomon</HI> pronouces <HI>Vanity of Vanities?</HI>—Have you to this Day been inattentive to the great Concern of a rational and immortal Being?—</P>
<P>YET, O indulgent Goodness!—Yet you live:—You hear the Voice of a compassionate God, inviting you to return unto Him. He addresses you as He did his ungrateful People in the Days of old. <HI>How shall I give thee up Ephraim! How shall I deliver thee Israel! My Heart is turned within me, my Repentings are kindled together.</HI></P>
<P>ATTEND, O my Brethren, to the heavenly Voice; it speaks particularly to you who are in the Morning of Life, the flourishing Bloom of Youth: This is the noblest Opportunity
<PB N="126" REF="013514_0129_0F90F0416D972C50"/>
you will ever enjoy, to lay a sure Foundation for future Safety. Your Hearts are not pre∣possessed with the distracting Cares of Life, nor your Consciences rendered insensible by inveterate Habits of Vice. Nature is now in her Prime, and Grace is more frequently be∣stowed upon young Persons, then on those who are grown old in Sin.</P>
<P>BUT in what Language shall I address those who are bowed down under the Weight of Years and Infirmities—and are grown gray in the Service of Satan?—Must I say your Day is past—your Doom irreversible?—God forbid that I should be sent on so terrible a Message. —Your Case is dangerous, but not desperate: Through the Patience of Heaven, you are yet commanded <HI>to seek the Lord while He may be found:</HI> Let your vanishing Breath be employed in constant and ardent Prayer to that Being who not only permits you to live in this World but invites you to draw near <HI>to the Throne of His Grace.</HI> In a few Days more your Doom will be fixed: Hope, the Relief of the Misera∣ble, will forsake you forever.</P>
<P>MAY a gracious God convince you of your dangerous Situation, and excite you to fly for Deliverance to Him, <HI>whom God hath exalted to be a Prince and a Savior, to give Repentance and Remission of Sins!</HI> To Him be Glory forever and ever. AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON VIII. The JOY of FAITH.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 PETER, I. 8.</BIBL>
<Q>Whom having not seen ye love, in whom though now ye see Him not, <HI>YET BE∣LIEVING YE REJOICE</HI> with Joy un∣speakable and full of Glory.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO rejoice is agreeable to all Mankind; though there are but few, who have a just Foundation for it. None have a Claim to this Privilege, but those who are in Friendship with that adorable Being, who is the Fountain of Felicity to all his Creatures. All the human Race are become Enemies to God, through the Depravity of their Natures and the voluntary Transgressions of their Lives: A Reconciliation must take place, otherwise the Enmity will be perpetual, and the Misery of Man irrecoverable.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="013514_0131_0F90F57EB9038CF0"/>IN <HI>Christ God is reconciling the World unto Himself:</HI> None can rejoice in God, but those who are interested in His Dear Son: He has made Satisfaction for the Sins of a guilty World; but those who do not receive Him as their Savior are deprived of the Advantages which flow from his Merits and Mediation: He hath purchased every Blessing for his People, but those who are not united to Him by Faith, <HI>are Aliens and Strangers from the Commonwealth of Israel and the Covenants of Promise.</HI></P>
<P>ST. PETER, in the Words of my Text, describes the Character of true Christians, and declares their Privilege. That Savior who was once an Inhabitant of this inferior Earth, but now <HI>seated at the Right Hand of the Majesty on High,</HI> is the Object of their undissembled Affection: They view Him by Faith, in all the Glories of his Person and Character; <HI>and believing they rejoice.</HI>—The Words of my Text teach us this Truth, which shall be the Subject of our present Meditation—
<Q>ALL true Believers have a just Foundation for Rejoicing.—</Q></P>
<P>TO illustrate this, let us take a View of some of their important Privileges.—Their Sins are forgiven—Their Persons and Per∣formances are accepted—Their Natures are
<PB N="129" REF="013514_0132_0F90F58252A0D450"/>
sanctified—They are the Care of a distin∣guished Providence—Nothing can do them any essential Hurt—All Things will conspire to promote their real Good—They have the assured Prospect of immortal Glory.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST, THEY may rejoice that their Sins are forgiven.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the Covenant which God establishes with them through Christ their exalted Head: <HI>I will be merciful to your Unrighteousness, your Iniquities will I remember no more.</HI> To learn the Value of this Privilege, let us consi∣der the Number and Aggravation of our Sins. —But <HI>who can understand his Errors!</HI> Who can recount his continual Deviations from the Law of God, the unerring Standard of our Duty! In many Things we all offend, in every Thing we fall short: The Defects which attend our best Performances are highly crimi∣nal: The Defilements which accompany our purest Services are justly offensive to the un∣spotted Majesty of Heaven.—What shall we say of our presumptuous Violations of the Divine Commands!—These are committed against Light and Love; not through involun∣tary Surprize, but deliberate Rebellion: They are peculiarly displeasing to God, and call aloud for Vengeance.</P>
<P>HOW astonishing is that Grace! which par∣dons all these Sins of every Order and Degree, with all the heinous Circumstances which
<PB N="130" REF="013514_0133_0F90F5838069D9A8"/>
attend them.—With what admiring Gratitude must we rejoice in that God, who declares, <HI>He is merciful and gracious, abundant in Good∣ness and Truth, forgiving Iniquity, Transgression and Sin!</HI></P>
<P>TO increase our Gratitude we may consider, the pardoning Mercy of God is not barely a present Benefit, but attended with the most lasting and salutary Effects. It assures us of immediate Safety, and preserves us from future Condemnation. The Sentence of Absolution is past in Favor of every true Believer in the Court of Heaven, and will never be revoked, through the varying Scenes of the present Life, or the unchanging Ages of Eternity. Well might the Psalmist triumph in his Happiness, and pronounce a Blessedness on the Man <HI>whose Iniquities are forgiven.</HI></P>
<P>LET us suppose a Malefactor condemned to suffer an infamous Death; the Day is come; the appointed Hour approaches, in which he must deliver himself into the Hands of the Executioner; he beholds with weeping Eyes and a trembling Heart, the solemn Preparation made for his Punishment.—If in the critical Moment a Pardon arrive, which delivers him from all his Distresses and Fears; will not his Heart leap for Joy, and Nature sink under the excessive Transport?—But God bestows a more inestimable Favor on the true Believer.— He delivers him not from the Pains of a

<HEAD>SECONDLY, HE admits them to Friend∣ship; their Persons and Performances are accepted.</HEAD>
<P>A PRINCE may pardon a Criminal and not enroll him among the Number of his Acquain∣tance: He may open the Doors of his Prison, and not advance him to the Dignity of a Fa∣vorite. But God manifests his Love to those, who receive <HI>Forgiveness through the Blood of Jesus:</HI> He not only obliterates the Remem∣brance of their Guilt, but embraces them in the Arms of Favor: He not only admits them among the Train of his menial Servants, but exalts them to the Honors and Privileges of his Children: His Anger is removed; He beholds them with Complacency and Delight, and through his dear Son, graciously accepts their poor imperfect Services.</P>
<P>WHO can comprehend their Dignity and Blessedness! They have free Access to the Throne of Grace, and may approach his Presence with filial Confidence: They may implore his Aid in every Exigence; and take Shelter <HI>under the Shadow of his Wings</HI> in every Danger: He gives them a sacred Assu∣rance, that <HI>He is their</HI> GOD, and that all his awful and amiable Attributes shall be exerted for their Advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="013514_0135_0F90F584EFE04578"/>THIS is a perpetual Source of the most refined and transporting Joy.—<HI>This God is my God,</HI> may the Believer say;—not barely by an external Title, but by a firm and indisso∣luble Covenant: He not only honors me with the Name, but affords me the Happiness of his Children: Surely this is an allsufficient Portion; we may rejoice in it, though desti∣tute of all other Comfort. <HI>Although the Fig-Tree shall not blossom, neither shall Fruit be in the Vines, the Labor of the Olives shall fail, and the Fields shall yield no Meat, the Flock shall be cut off from the Fold, and there shall be no Herd in the Stalls: Yet will I rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my Salvation.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THIRDLY, THIS Restoration to the Divine Favor is always accompanied with the Sanctification of our Nature.</HEAD>
<P>NO Change in our Nature can make us happy, while we remain the Servants of Sin: Our discordant Appetites and Passions must keep us in pepetual Disquietude: The Breasts of the Wicked are like the tempestuous Ocean, in constant Agitation.—But the Divine Spirit, which resides in the Heart of the true Believer, rectifies the Disorders of our cor∣rupted Nature, and introduces Peace and Har∣mony, instead of lawless Riot and Confusion. —He implants an heavenly Principle, which inclines us to revere the Authority of the Great God, to obey the unerring Dictates of his
<PB N="133" REF="013514_0136_0F90F585343CDD20"/>
Word, and regulate our various Appetites and Passions by the Laws of Reason and Religion. —By the benign Influences of this blessed Agent—I ight succeeds to Darkness—Order to Confusion—Beauty to Deformity. The Storms of Passion subside, the savage Disposition is softned and subdued.—The Proud become meek—the Morose, benevolent—and Mon∣sters of Vice, Examples of the most amiable Virtues. The tyrannical Empire of Sin is con∣quered, and that <HI>Kingdom</HI> set up in the Souls of Men, <HI>which consists in Righteousness, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>BELIEVERS being thus restored to the Favor of God and brought to submit to his equitable Government,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FOURTHLY, THEY become the distinguish∣ing Care of Divine Providence.</HEAD>
<P>THAT all comprehending Eye, which with a single Glance, surveys the whole Creation, is fixed upon them as the Objects of his com∣placential Regards:—That unerring Wisdom, that directs the stupendous Revolutions of Nature, is their unfailing Companion and Guide:—That omnipotent Arm, whith No∣thing can resist, is their Guard and Defence: <HI>He</HI> who <HI>maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Ministers Flames of Fire, gives</HI> these benevo∣lent Beings <HI>Charge concerning them, to keep them in all their Ways.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="013514_0137_0F90F585F5FE5B70"/>WELL then, may they rejoice, though sur∣rounded with Darkness, Difficulty and Danger. God is their <HI>Sun,</HI> to direct their Way; their <HI>Shield</HI> to defend them from their numberless Enemies. They are conducted through the Wilderness of this World, by his Word and Spirit: They are preserved in Safety by his guardian Care. The Faithful may therefore triumph in their Almighty Protector and Friend, and say with the <HI>Psalmist, Because He is at my Right-Hand I shall not be moved.—Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death I will fear no Evil.</HI>—In Consequence of this distinguished Care of Divine Providence, I proceed to say,</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIFTHLY, NOTHING can do them any essential Hurt.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR Security is founded on their Union to the Son of God, and confirmed by an un∣alterable Promise, that <HI>Nothing shall seperate them from his Love.</HI> In this Situation they may possess their Souls in Peace, amidst the Tempests which disturb the Repose of the Rest of Mankind. The Basis of their Happi∣ness remains unshaken, in all the Revolutions which take Place in this lower World. At∣tached to their exalted Head, who holds the Reins of universal Empire, they shall finally overcome the Power and Policy of their Ene∣mies. They may be serene in the greatest Dangers; secure in the severest Trials; happy in the most afflicted Condition.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="013514_0138_0F90F586B10489C8"/>THE Edicts of Princes may banish them to uncultivated Desarts, and the Fires of Perse∣cution consume all their earthly Enjoyments: But if we belong to Christ, our Happiness is out of the Reach of Accidents and Disappoint∣ments. Secure of an invincible Friend, we need not fear—the Lightnings of Heaven— the Shakings of the Earth—nor the Flames that shall consume this habitable Globe.— Let the <HI>Sun</HI> be covered with Darkness, the <HI>Moon</HI> withdraw her Light, and this material Universe sink into Ruin:—Let these <HI>Tabernacles</HI> of Clay be destroyed by the Stroke of Death, and this beautiful Arrangement of <HI>Flesh and Blood</HI> return to it's original Dust:—Let the illustrious Day appear, when the SON OF GOD shall descend from Heaven in radiant Majesty, and summon the trembling Nations to stand at his impartial Bar:—The true Believer <HI>will lift up his Head with Joy</HI> amidst these asto∣nishing Scenes, and with a Voice of Triumph congratulate the Appearance of his GOD and SAVIOR: Clothed with his Righteousness, he fears no Condemnation; animated by his Spirit, he is sure to be found among the Num∣ber of his Friends.—If the Judge is his Friend, what can prejudice his Happiness? I may add,</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SIXTLY, ALL these great Revolutions shall conspire to promote his real Good.</HEAD>
<P>THE Destruction of the Universe prepares the Way for the Descent of his adorable
<PB N="136" REF="013514_0139_0F90F587CC6FB740"/>
Redeemer: The Dissolution of the Body intro∣duces him into the Joys of the divine Pre∣sence: Death is a Messenger sent from Heaven to convey him into a State of immortal Exis∣tence. When the <HI>Heavens vanish away,</HI> the Vail is removed that conceals the ineffable Glories of <HI>the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE we reside upon Earth, we neces∣sarily partake of those Miseries which are inseperable from a State of Mortality; but when removed from this <HI>Valley of Tears,</HI> we enter on the true Felicity and Glory of our Natures. As the Children of the <HI>first Adam,</HI> we are subject to the Empire of Sin and Death; by our Relation to the <HI>second Adam,</HI> we are Heirs of an heavenly <HI>Kingdom,</HI> where all His People shall <HI>live and reign with Him forever.</HI> —This leads me to say,</P>

<HEAD>SEVENTHLY and finally, THEY rejoice in the Prospect of immortal Glory.</HEAD>
<P>THEIR Joy is not confined to the narrow Boundaries of Time, but extends through eter∣nal Ages.—This makes it full without any Defect, complete without any Alloy.</P>
<P>THE happiest Condition on Earth is not equal to the magnificent Promises of divine Grace, nor answerable to the sublime Hopes which God has implanted in the Breasts of his People. Though their Joys are superior to
<PB N="137" REF="013514_0140_0F90F58838B26398"/>
those of the most fortunate Worlding, yet they do not satisfy the Immensity of our De∣sires: We only perceive the Dawn of an hea∣venly Day. The Fruits of Grace are but Fore∣tastes of the Harvest of Glory. We are re∣freshed with a few Drops which flow from the unbounded Ocean of Blessedness. We have a transient Glimpse of that amiable Counte∣nance which diffuses Life and Joy through the Celestial Regions.—Even these imperfect En∣joyments, <HI>put Gladness into our Hearts,</HI> and enable us to rejoice <HI>more than when Corn and Wine are increased.</HI> In the Destitution of all Things, we may adopt the Language of the Psalmist, <HI>Thou O Lord! art my Portion in the Land of the Living: Whom have I in Heaven but Thee? and there is none upon Earth that I desire besides Thee.</HI></P>
<P>IN some favorite Moments, the faithful Servants of God experience those divine Con∣solations, which change this Earth into a Para∣dise of Delights: Filled with the transporting Views of a Savior's Excellency and Beauty, the World vanishes from their Sight: Inspired with Love of the supreme Good, all Creatures appear as comparative Nothings. To forsake the Pleasures of Sense for the Enjoyment of God, gives them greater Satisfaction than to possess them in their highest Perfection.</P>
<Q>IF, O my God! to behold thy Face in this Land of Exile, <HI>through a Glass darkly,</HI>

<P>WELL <HI>may the Voice of Rejoicing be heard in the Tabernacles of the Righteous.</HI>—Have I received Jesus as my Savior?—Has a View of his Glory inspired me with unfeigned Love to his Person and Character?—Is his Salvation more precious in my Esteem than the dearest earthly Enjoyments?—Do I value <HI>his Favor as Life, and his Loving-kindness as better than Life?</HI>—Then let me rejoice that God has opened my Eyes, to discern the true Value of Things, and directed me to choose that <HI>good Part that can never be taken away.</HI> After a few Struggles more with a corrupted Heart, a few more Selfdenials in an ensnaring World, I shall enter upon a State of Existence, in which my Nature will be perfected, my Joys sincere, my Happiness complete, without Inter∣ruption, and without End.</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. THIS discovers the Excellency of true Religion, and evidences that it is not an Enemy to human Happiness.</HEAD>
<P>DELUDED Mortals are prejudiced against the Ways of Christ; they imagine they are be∣set with Thorns, and that those who walk in them must bid Adieu to every agreeable Enjoyment.</P>
<P>BUT, this is a fatal Mistake: Our amiable Master consults the present Comfort as well as future Welfare of those who enroll themselves under his Banners. He indeed prohibits those sensual Excesses, which pollute the Body, de∣grade the Mind, and ever prove <HI>Bitterness in the End:</HI> All his Laws are admirably adapted to make us happy in ourselves, and Blessings to all around us.</P>
<P>THE Pleasures of Sin are indeed inconsistent with the Character of a Disciple of Christ. All who follow Him, are strictly enjoined to keep themselves <HI>unspotted from the World,</HI> it's dan∣gerous and polluting Manners: But they are introduced into a new Scene of Delights, supe∣rior in their Kind and more lasting in their Duration. We renounce that false and delu∣sive Joy, which, like a blazing Meteor makes a gaudy Appearance, but soon vanishes into empty

Air: In the room of these disguised Trifles we receive Joys spiritual and divine, which are con∣tinually refining, and will encrease more and more till they leave not one unaccomplish'd Wish—not one unsatisfied Desire. The Plea∣sures of Religion, may be compared to the <HI>Path of the Just, which shineth more and more to the perfect Day.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Joys, are discovered in the Gospel to those, who without its irradiating Beams, must have remained in the Regions <HI>of the Sha∣dow of Death:</HI> They are offered to those, who without these glad Tidings, must live in perpe∣tual Fear, die in unutterable distress, and after Death be involved in <HI>Blackness of Darkness forever.</HI></P>
<P>HOW consolatory are the Discoveries of the Gospel! They present to our View a God re∣conciled through the atoning Blood of Jesus: —A Savior sufficient to to supply all our Wants, and ready to relieve us in all our Necessities: —To those who thankfully receive these Reve∣lations of divine Grace, it makes the most pre∣cious Promises—and assures them the Possession of every desirable Blessing through every Period of their Existence.</P>
<P>WHEN we rejoice in any created Good, our Joy may be innocent, but it cannot be endur∣ing: Earthly Joys may delight for a Moment,
<PB N="141" REF="013514_0144_0F90F58C934551B0"/>
but are like <HI>the Crackling of Thorns under a Pot;</HI> they form a sudden Blaze which soon expires.—But to rejoice in <HI>the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> is to build the Fabric of human Hap∣piness on an immoveable Basis, which neither the Tempests of Life, nor the Depredations of Death can diminish or destroy. This is to possess a Joy which will not decay with Age, but survive the Funeral of universal Nature, and flourish through all Eternity. Well may the Believer <HI>rejoice with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory.</HI></P>

<HEAD>II. THIS should be improved as a mighty Argument to perswade us to accept the Great Salvation.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is the Design I have been carrying on in several Discourses; and certainly Nothing can be more worthy the Attention of a Being in a State of Trial, and designed for an eternal Existence. If this is despised and neglected, the Wrath of God attends you in all your Ways—It lies down with you at Night—it rises with you in the Morning—It accompanies you through all the Business and Diversions of the Day: A secret Curse is mingled with all your Enjoyments: You are every Moment exposed to the Arrests of Death: This delivers you over to unceasing Torments.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="013514_0145_0F90F58E06A4ED80"/>TO rejoice in these Circumstances is the most thoughtless Stupidity. The Joys of the Sinner may be compared to the Revels of a condem∣ned Malefactor, who in the height of his Folly goes dancing to an infamous Execution.</P>
<P>THINK, O my Brethren, how full—how free—how unlimitted are the Calls of Sove∣reign Mercy? With what Authority does God Command! With what Compassion does He invite! With what Earnestness does He be∣seech you, not to refuse the Offers of his Love!</P>
<P>REVIEW the unspeakable Blessings which will be the immediate Portion of those, who receive this great Salvation with Humility and Gratitude, and labour to obtain it with indefa∣tigable Zeal and Diligence.—<HI>Being justified by Faith in Jesus,</HI> they become Members of his sacred Family, they enjoy the Privileges of the Children of God, and in the Relation of Children are Heirs of His heavenly Kingdom. Compared to this, what are Crowns and Scep∣tres! What are all the Glories of created Nature!—glittering Phantoms—disguised Nothings.</P>
<P>BUT if Men bar their Hearts against the Impressions of incarnate Love, and give the Blessed Savior a final refusal; <HI>God—His elect Angels</HI>—and <HI>the Assembly of perfected Spirits</HI> will rejoice in their Damnation—May infinite

Mercy prevent this terrible Event!—Perhaps you have lived long under a Dispensation of Grace, but have entertained no Thoughts of preparing for Eternity:—Perhaps you are full of gay Expectations of Pleasure in the Ways of Sin:—In the Pride of Life, captivated with the Enjoyment of your Lusts, immersed in Earthly Cares—you pour Contempt on the Solemnities of Religion.</P>
<P>BUT make a Pause—Bethink yourselves before it be too late: You have no Time to trifle—Your <HI>Life is as a Vapor,</HI> and may ex∣pire before the Dawn of another Day: Or, if your Time upon Earth is lengthned out, a provoked God may <HI>swear in his Wrath that you shall never enter into his Rest.—Consider this, ye that forget God—Kiss ye the Son lest He be angry, when his Wrath is but kindled: Blessed are they that trust in Him.</HI>—</P>
<P>TO whom be Glory forever and ever.</P>
