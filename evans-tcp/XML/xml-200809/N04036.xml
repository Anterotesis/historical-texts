<Q><P><HI>My good Friends and Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>IN the Fall of the last Year I notified You, That I had the Honour of being appointed His Majesty King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Governour of this His Province of the <HI>Massachu∣setts-Bay</HI>; and assur'd You, That I was determin'd to observe the Treaties subsist∣ing between the British Subjects and your Tribes; and to treat You with all Kindness as King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s good Friends, so long as you should on your Part observe your Articles and Treaties of Submission to the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and behave your selves peaceably and friendly towards the English Settlements: And I also acquainted 
<PB N="3" REF="004976_0003_100E4F0901BC3AA8"/>
you, That if any of your Tribes were desirous to send Delegates to Me at Boston, <HI>Care should be taken to transport them thither in the Province Sloop, with suitable Accommo∣dations; soon after which, Col.</HI> Lewis <HI>and Capt.</HI> Sam <HI>were sent from you to</HI> Boston, <HI>and in two Conferences held at the Council Chamber there, on the 3d and 8th of last</HI> Decem∣ber <HI>saluted Me and the great Council of the Province, in the Name of the</HI> Penobscott <HI>and your other Tribes; and in their Names inform'd Me of your</HI> Joy <HI>at bearing my Letter read; and of your Desire that Friendship might continue between Us; and laid before Me the Difficulties in your Trade, arising from a Scarcity of Provisions, Tobacco, Powder and Shot, and the Truck-Master's not understanding your Language; and desired that Two Men might be appointed twice a Year to view the Truck-Houses; and that an Account of the Prices of Bever, Peltry, and other Goods might be publickly posted up there: In all which Matters I promis'd, That you should be redress'd; and told your Delegates that I purpos'd, (GOD willing) to see your Tribes near your own Habitations, some Time in the ensuing Spring; and that if you had any Thing further to lay before Me then, I should consider of that also. And I am now come to this Place that I might see you all Face to Face, and perform to you in Person what I promis'd to your Delegates at</HI> Boston: <HI>And I re∣turn Thanks to the great GOD of Heaven and Earth, whose good Providence has most graciously preserved Us and our Ships in our Passage bither, amidst the Perils of a most violent Storm of Thunder and Lightning; for giving Us both this Opportunity of renew∣ing former Leagues, and confirming the Covenants of Peace and Friendship between Us; which I hope will be improved in such a Manner, that our Posterity may have cause to rejoice at our Meeting together this Day: And for this purpose I am now ready to bear, whatever you have to lay before me; and would have you speak with Freedom and O∣penness.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Indians, by <HI>Loron</HI> their Speaker, made Answer as follows;</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As your Excellency was mentioning, That GOD was pleas'd to grant you a safe Arrival, it was very agreable to us, that GOD was pleas'd to pre∣serve your Lives when in Danger, and land you in Safety. Likewise the seve∣ral Tribes at a great Distance, are safely arrived through the Goodness of GOD to this Spot.</P>
<P>We return Thanks to GOD for this Opportunity to see the Faces of one another in this Place.</P>
<P>And as your Excellency engag'd to meet us here, and have accordingly done it, we judge your Excellency sincere, and heartily rejoice therein. And as to the Matters proposed by your Excellency, we will Answer thereto to Mor∣row; when we shall shall declare the whole Secrets of our Hearts, we having no sinister corrupt Views in our Breasts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>What you say to me is very acceptable; and I expect to meet you to Morrow Morning according to your Desire; and I will give you the same Signal as I did this Morning, and desire you to be here within an Hour after that Time.</P>
<P>I hope you were taken good Care of last Night and this Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="004976_0004_100E4F0A8D345F00"/>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As your Excellency desires we may mention Things freely; We say, the Pork and Bread sell short last Night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall have a larger Proportion for the future. I ordered you an Ox this Morning; desire to know whether you have had it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We have not yet had it, though it was offered us, not having Time to eat it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>It shall be now delivered to you that you may refresh your selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We thank your Excellency, and do assure you, we believe where your Excellency is, nothing will be wanting.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>As you have nothing further to say, we will drink King <HI>GEORGE's</HI> Health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Toxus,</HI> Chief of <HI>Norridgewock,</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>We rejoyced when we first heard of your Excellency's coming, and have been here some Time, and are now heartily glad at the Sight of the Governour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Saquent,</HI> Chief of the <HI>Saco</HI> Tribe,</SPEAKER>
<P>We heartily rejoice, that we have been preserved in the Night past, and have now an Opportunity to see the great Governour in the sight of the Sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad to hear you have brought your Wives and Chil∣dren with you; and hope they are all in Health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians,</SPEAKER>
<P>They are all Well. We thank your Excellency.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then His Excellency drank to <HI>Edewakenk,</HI> chief Sachem of the <HI>Penobscott</HI> Tribe, and the rest of the Chiefs of all the Tribes, King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Health.</P>
<P>Who all drank King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Health to His Excellency.</P>
<P>His Excellency being inform'd that the Squaws were at a small Distance from the Tent on the Hill, ordered them and their Papooses a Glass of Wine, with his Service to the Squaws.</P>
<P>His Excellency also ordered a Glass of Rum to the young Men who appear'd under Arms as a Guard to the Sachems about 120 in Number.</P>
<P>His Excellency then congratulated Loron on his Recovery so far from his Indisposition as to be present this Day.</P>
<P>Who answer'd, That he thank'd His Excellency, and hop'd it would be a good Day to them all, That he was scarce able to attend, yet out of great Respect to the Governour, was now present.</P>

<P>The CONFERENCE continued, <HI>PRESENT,</HI> His EXCELLENCY <HI>William Shirley,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Captain-General and Governour in Chief, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> AND THE Chiefs of the several Tribes, &amp;<HI>c.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM glad to see you all here again to Day; and hope you are in Health, and have had sufficient Provision, and am now ready to hear what you have to say to Me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron;</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI> We are in good Health this Morning; and rejoice that your Excellency and the Gentlemen are all well also this Morning.</P>
<P>And as your Excellency desir'd Yesterday that we may speak freely, we de∣clare we now desire to renew the Treaty made in the Year 1727.</P>
<P>Which Treaty your Excellency has by you; and is the same we now mean. This is really the first Treaty, and those that were at the Treaty then, and their Children and Grand Children are obliged to observe it.</P>
<P>This is what we depend upon; and if any Thing should fall out contrary thereto, that Treaty is to be consulted, and both Sides to be judg'd by it.</P>
<P>The Treaty we have safe by us here; and though we don't understand Writing, the Treaty will speak for it self.</P>
<P>The Article of Trade is the chief and most material Thing; therefore is first to be considered. Some Time after the beginning of which Treaty, in 1726, the Trade was altered: And at the Conclusion of the Treaty afterwards, it was promis'd, That the Trade should be better regulated for the future: And it was further told us, if any Body should sell cheaper than the English, this Govern∣ment, would go beyond them, particularly the French, who were poorer than the English, and could not afford to sell cheaper. That at the first beginning of Trade a Stroud Blanket was <HI>Thirty Shillings</HI>: Corn was <HI>Seven Shillings</HI> per Bushel: Powder was <HI>Four Shillings</HI> per Pound: Shot at <HI>Ten Pence</HI> per Pound: And a strip'd Blanket was <HI>Twenty Shillings.</HI> And for all other little Things, which can't at present be enumerated, they were sold for a less Price at that Time than at this.</P>
<P>What is now said is the Truth concerning the Trade; which we are very uneasy under, that all Things should grow dearer every Year.</P>
<P>And as your Excellency desired us to speak the Truth, we shall be very free and open, and speak the whole Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="004976_0006_100E4F0F4098D500"/>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>That is my desire that you should use the greatest Freedom and Liberty; it being the End of our Meeting, that we should have a right Under∣standing of each other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>The reason of our mentioning the Affair of Trade, is because that Matter is the chief Band of our Peace and Friendship, and therefore should be well setled and concluded.</P>
<P>The Trade is not well furnished; and Things are not suitable as formerly, which will slacken Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>If you can mention any other Particulars concerning the Trade which you have not spoken of, endeavour to recollect them, and enumerate them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>At the Treaty in 1727, Governour DUMMER told us, he could supply us much cheaper than the French, who us'd yearly to make us a Present of Powder and Shot, which the English could better a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord than they.</P>
<P>Which Present we never have had, though we are daily looking out for it.</P>
<P>And as to the Truck-House here, it is always wanting Provisions, Tobacco, and many other necessary Things.</P>
<P>As for a Hundred Bushels of Corn, it is nothing; for it will not Supply a Bushel a Man when we come to Trade. Nay, Two Hundred Bushels is really nothing when we come to Trade, being so very little and insufficient that we are forc'd to divide it.</P>
<P>We desire there may be so much that every Man may have what he can pur∣chase, which will then be enough.</P>
<P>And we desire that a List of the Prizes of the Goods may be posted up here; and that Two Men may be chosen with an Interpreter to view the Truck-Houses, Spring and Fall by the Government to see that nothing be wanting therein.</P>
<P>Another Grievance is, That it was said, none of your young Men, should go into our Woods to Hunt; but should continue by the Water-Side, which is not comply'd withal.</P>
<P>The Reason of our mentioning it is, If they kill our hunting Game, we have nothing else to live upon; whereas the English till the Ground, and have other Ways to support themselves. This Practice if continued, will destroy our Livelihood.</P>
<P>Now we come to another Head, and speak for our Tribes in general, That <HI>Jabez Bradbury</HI> may be our Truck Master here at St. <HI>George</HI>'s.</P>
<P>The Reason thereof is; <HI>Jabez</HI> can understand us, and we him; and it is very difficult for one that don't understand the Language to Trade with us.</P>
<P>When we begun to trade, it us'd to be the Custom to give Money for Peltry, but now we can't understand Cyphering; and they tell us, Your Peltry comes to so much; by which as we don't understand it, we are cheated, being obliged to depend upon the Word of the Truck-Master for the Weight by which we often suffer.</P>
<P>We have done concerning the Trade.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004976_0007_100E4F10D05F5C48"/>
What we have now repeated was engag'd in Governour DUMMER's Treaty; and we desire those Things may now be remembred and agreed to that we may Live in Love and Peace.</P>
<P>As I was the Chief in that Day, and was the Cause of our Tribes complying with that Treaty; they desire me now to strengthen my self and have it con∣firm'd.</P>
<P>This is all we have to say at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you mean this is all you have to say on any Head whatsoever?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>This is at present all. We now wait an Answer from your Excellency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be glad to hear all you have to say on every Head, that I may consider all the Matters together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We have one Article more to mention, It was said in the Time of Governour <HI>DUMMER's</HI> Treaty, the English desir'd to go no further than the Salt∣Water relish'd. The English then told us, they would not step a Foot over that Lisle. It is a very long Foot that reaches from that Line to the Place from whence we came.</P>
<P>This is all we have to say at present; and we have here the Treaty which we desire your Excellency to look over, and then return it to us again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>We have Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty in the same manner you have, which we brought with us, and we will compare that with your's, and see that it be same, and then will make use of our own.</P>
<P>Which was accordingly done to the Satisfaction of the Tribes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>The English Government think as well as you, that they ought to regulate themselves by Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty, and that it is binding on our Children and Grand Children, as you have said. And we are glad you have desired to walk by Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty, that we may determine Things by it: And I will look over that Treaty and consider of it; and of every Thing else you have said. And I desire you would with Openness and Freedom declare any Thing else you have to say now, because the great Council of <HI>Boston</HI> is near at Hand, and we must soon go there; And I desire that we may finish so that we may have an Opportunity to dine together before our Return to <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>Are you satisfyed that the Treaty we have now shewn you is the same with that you have by you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I again desire, That if you have any new Matter to mention, you would now do it, that it may be considered, with what is already offered; and that I may any answer them altogether.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="004976_0008_100E2761836097F0"/>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We are grieved at some Accidents about killing of Horses by our young Men. As soon as we heard of it, we sent to them to forbid such Practices.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>The Government was also sorry when they heard of it. And upon our hearing that the Men to whom the Horses belong'd, had taken the Guns from the young Men, we recommended it to them to deliver up the Guns again to them, lest it should be a Prejudice to them, expecting the young Men would make Satisfaction for the Injuries done: I desire to know whether they have done so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no Satisfaction, but the keeping their Guns, which has been a great Damage to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sensible of it; and therefore recommended that the Guns should be given them again, upon their engaging Satisfaction, which now we are sensible has not been done; and therefore shall enquire into that Affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As your Excellency was mentioning, that the great Court was near; and you wou'd return Home; we are of the same Mind, but desire there may be no more haste than good Speed; that we may moderately consider and determine Things, that we may go away in Peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I also desire that we may make no more haste than good speed; and would therefore have every particular Head of Grievance from any of the Tribes now mentioned, that all may be answered and fully setled before we go.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>All the Tribes speak the same Things, which have been now menti∣oned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>Have any of the other Tribes any Thing further to offer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toxus, Chief of <HI>Norridgewock;</HI></SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI> We have a small Matter to offer con∣cerning our Tribe.</P>
<P>The same that the <HI>Penobscott</HI> Tribe have said concerning the Trade, we also say.</P>
<P>I shall freely declare what we have to say: The Gentleman that was order'd to <HI>Richmond</HI> to Trade is gone from thence; not but we lik'd Capt. <HI>Minot</HI> very well at <HI>Richmond</HI>: And the Gun-Smith that is there we like very well, Mr. <HI>Wood.</HI> We should be glad he would be our Truck-Master. The Reason of my mentio∣ning him is because the <HI>Penobscott</HI> Tribe had mentioned <HI>Jabez Bradbury</HI> before for this Truck-House, who would else have been agreable to us.</P>
<P>I have now done speaking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>There are no Chiefs of the <HI>Saco</HI> Tribe here present; but they desire also that the Truck-Houses may be well provided for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="9" REF="004976_0009_100E4F1445DB0DD0"/>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I will consider all the Things mentioned; and answer them to Mor∣row Morning; and desire you would come as soon as you can after the usual Signal, because hitherto you have come so late that nothing can be done in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>I have ordered you another Ox for you Provision this Day, with other Things suitable to comfort and refresh you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We desire that the Refreshment for our Throats may be only to Night and not in the Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I like it well, and shall give Orders accordingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We desire a Dish of Peas for change of Diet.</P>

<P>We come only about some little Trade at <HI>Saco</HI>; and to pay our Respects here to the Governour.</P>
<P>As to the Trade; We thought when we sold our Peltry it was very valuable, but when we receiv'd the Pay it was very little, almost nothing, occasion d by the English not purchasing the Bever till a good while after Christmas, and then would give but a poor Price.</P>
<P>And since Capt. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Death, we can't but very seldom see the Face of the present Truck-Master.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR</SPEAKER>
<P>I have considered what Sachem Loron said Yesterday and what the other Chiefs have now said, and shall give you an Answer with all Freedom and Sincerity.</P>
<P>The Government of this Province is desirous as well as you, to renew the Treaty made and concluded by Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI> in the Year 1727, at <HI>Casco-Bay.</HI></P>
<P>We think with you, that we and you, with our and your Children and Grand∣Children are bound and obliged to observe and perform it.</P>
<P>And you rightly observe the said Treaty to be in writing and <HI>must speak for itself.</HI> And that as you say, It must be consulted by us both and we must be judged and concluded by it.</P>
<P>I shall speak first of Trade, because you mention'd it first.</P>
<P>And it is truly, as you say, the chief Tye of Friendship and Union between us and your Tribes.</P>
<P>It is true, That in Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty you were told, the English would supply you cheaper than any other Nation whatsoever, in which the <HI>French</HI> must be included. And you will find by what I am now going to say, the English have performed their Agreement with you in that Respect. The Justice of this Government towards you will appear in those very Articles you mention'd.</P>
<P>Yesterday you observ'd, That in the Year 1727, when Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty was made, that stroud Blankets were 30s a piece. Corn 7s pr. Bushel, Powder 4s. pr. Pound, Shot at 10<HI>d.</HI> pr. Pound, strip'd Blankets at 20s a peice. And I would observe to you, that at that Time a Pound of your Bever was sold at 9s. pr. Pound, and other Peltry in proportion.</P>
<P>We are sensible, that Strouds are now sold at the Truck-House from 45s. to 50s. a piece, Corn is now sold at 10s. pr. Bushel, Powder at 7s. Shot at 19<HI>d.</HI> strip'd Blankets at 38s. Now the same Strouds which are sold to you at <HI>St. George</HI>'s Fort from 45s. to 50s. a piece, are sold at <HI>Boston</HI> to the English for 52s. a piece, Corn is sold at <HI>Boston</HI> from 12s. to 16s. a Bushel, Powder at <HI>Boston</HI> is sold for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. pr. Pound, and in the Country Towns at 10s. pr Pound, and Shot and strip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Blankets at the same Price for which they are sold to you at the Truck Houses. And your Bever which was sold in Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Time, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld by you for 16s pr. Pound at the Truck Houses.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004976_0011_100E4F1906AB4A68"/>
I will endeavour to explain to you the Reason of the Difference between the Prices of these Goods at the Time of Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty, and the present Prices.</P>
<P>First, It was expresly told you by Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI> that the Prices of Goods would be sometimes higher and sometimes lower, according to the Plenty or Scarcity of them.</P>
<P>In the next Place the 30s. which you observe the stroud Blankets were sold for at the Time of that Treaty was 30s. Paper Money. And I would observe to you, that the Paper Money since that Time has sunk so much in value, that 55s. of it now is worth no more than 30s. was then; so that the Blankets which you now give from 45s. to 50s. for, are not so dear as the Blankets at 30s. in the time of Gover∣nour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s Treaty.</P>
<P>To make this Matter still more plain, A Pound of your Bever which the Eng∣lish then gave 9s. for, they now give 16s. for; and yet we do not complain, tho' the Price of your Bever has rose more upon us, than the Price of our Provisions upon you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the Price of Bever that is nothing to the purpose, for every Thing is at a stand. The Price of Bever and the Goods now are the same as then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>To explain this yet further.</P>
<P>A less Quantity of Bever will purchase a stroud Blanket at this time, than what would purchase one in Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI>'s time. And it is a Demonstration of the Justice of this Government to you, that you have the Goods at the Truck Houses at a more moderate Price than the English have at <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>Another Reason of the Advance of the Price of our Goods is, that the War with <HI>Spain</HI> and all Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> at this Time, makes the Powder much dearer than it would otherwise be, as also all sorts of Provisions.</P>
<P>And another Proof of our Justice and Friendship is, that the Government lose considerably every Year by letting you have their Goods at such low Prizes, which they do purely out of Friendship and Kindness to you.</P>
<P>What is now said concerns the Justice of the Government only.</P>
<P>If you are ever impos'd upon by the Truck Masters it's a great Fault, which the Government don't allow of; and when they know it, will always endeavour to prevent.</P>
<P>I don't like that Practice of the Truck-Masters which you mention, their tell∣ing you what your Bever and Peltry comes to, in the Lump, without giving you a particular Account of it; and then delivering you Goods in exchange for it after the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Manner.</P>
<P>This is such a Method as seems to me to give the Truck-Masters room to blind both You and the Government, if they think sit.</P>
<P>To prevent this for the future, I shall take care that the Weight of your Bever and Peltry small be marked down by the Truck-Master; and he shall deliver. you a Bill of Parcels of the quantity and price of Bever, and the Goods p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in exchange for them.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004976_0012_100E4F1A8E274E68"/>
By this Means you will have a Paper delivered to you containing the quanti∣ty and price of your Bever, and the particulars and price of the Goods delivered to you in exchange for them; and by means of that Paper you will see whether you are impos'd upon; and if you will complain to the Government you shall always have strict Justice done you.</P>
<P>And I will order an Account of the several Prices of your Peltry andour Goods to be posted up in the Truck-Houses, that you may be inform'd of the Prices of both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Lewis,</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>This is what Iat present think of; and if the Government at any Time, shall find out other or better Methods to prevent your being impos'dup∣on by the Truck-Masters, they will do it.</P>
<P>I think it is very reasonable, since you depend upon supplying your selves at our Truck-Houses with Provisions and other Necessaries, that they should be sufficiently stored with them for your Wants and Demands; therefore the Go∣vernment will take Care it shall be done; and will provide sufficient Stores for every particular Person as they shall want.</P>
<P>And as you have desired, I will take Care that the Government shall appoint two fit Persons in the Spring and Fall, with an Interpreter, to view the Truck∣Houses; and you shall have seasonable Notice of it, that if you have any thing to complain of, you may have an Opportunity to be heard by the Persons so ap∣pointed.</P>
<P>As to Mr. <HI>Bradbury</HI> and Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>'s being appointed Truck-Masters at <HI>George</HI>'s and <HI>Richmond</HI> Forts, the great Council of the Province which chuse those Officers, will always chuse suitable Persons for that Service. Since you desire to have Mr. <HI>Bradbury</HI> for your Truck-Master at <HI>St. George</HI>'s, I will recommend him to the great Council.</P>
<P>I think his understanding your Language is a considerable Qualification for a Truck-Master; which I doubt not will have it's Weight with them.</P>
<P>I don't find by the Treaty, that Governour <HI>DUMMER</HI> ever promis'd that the Government would (as the <HI>French</HI> did) every Year make you a Present of Pow∣der and Shot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>It may not be wrote; but it was told us so then.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>As the Treaty is in Writing, we must resort to that for the Truth of Things.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding you never were Friends to the English, as you have been to the French in Time of War, yet this Government have frequently made you considerable Presents; and the Generosity of the Government will always be proportion'd to your Friendship to the English.</P>
<P>We shall always treat you with Kindness; but our Presents must be the Effect of our Friendship and Generosity; and not of any Terms of Agreement to make them to you at certain Times and Seasons.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004976_0013_100E4F1D340E0108"/>
The English Government have always look'd upon it as their Honour to treat their Friends with Generosity.</P>
<P>I am sensible you support your selves by hunting in your Woods, and not by Tillage of your Lands as you have observ'd.</P>
<P>I therefore think if any of our young Men hunt on your Grounds, it's a great Piece of Injustice done you; and I shall always look upon it as such.</P>
<P>And I will recommend it to the great Council to prevent such Trespasses be∣ing made upon you; and to oblige the young Men for all such Offences to pay double Damages.</P>
<P>As to the Settlements of Lands, as you observ'd Yesterday, Governour <HI>DUM∣MER</HI>'s Treaty must <HI>judge</HI> between us and decide that Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the First. We desir'd the English might not go where the Fresh Water runs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>The Treaty must determine that Matter; Therefore I shall read several Paragraphs of the Treaty it self.</P>
<P><HI>In</HI> Page 13, <HI>are these Words</HI>;
<Q><HI>Lient</HI> GOVERNOUR, If there should be any Dispute or Controversy hereafter between the English and you, respecting the Titles and Claims of Land; and after a fair and lawful Trial, if the English cannot make out and prove their Titles to the Lands controverted, they shall disclaim them; but if the English can make out their Titles, then the Indians shall disclaim the Lands so contro∣verted.</Q></P>
<P><HI>To which you then made Answer</HI></P>
<Q>We understand it very well, and agree to it, that it shall be so; The Con∣troversies we understand are to be determined by impartial Judges and disinte∣rested Persons, appointed for that Purpose, to do equal Justice.</Q>
<P><HI>And in your Treaty of Submission, at that Time, in</HI> Page 9, <HI>you have stipulated,</HI>
<Q>That His Majesty's Subjects the English, shall and may peaceably and qui∣etly enter upon, improve and forever enjoy all and singular their Rights of Lands and former Settlements, Properties and Possessions, within the Eastern Parts of the said Province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay</HI>; together with all Islands, Islets, Shores, Beaches and Fishery within the same, without any Molestation or Claims by us or any other Indians; and be in no ways molested, interrup∣ted or disturbed therein. Saving unto the <HI>Penobscott, Norridgewock,</HI> and other Tribes within His Majesty's Province aforesaid, and their natural Descendants respectively, all their Land, Liberties and Properties, not by them conveyed or sold to or possessed by any of the English Subjects as aforesaid; as also the Priviledge of Fishing, Hunting and Fowling as formerly.</Q>
<Q><PB N="14" REF="004976_0014_100E4F1EF85F07C0"/>
If any Controversy or Difference at any Time hereafter happen to arise be∣tween any of the English and Indians for any real or supposed Wrong or Injury done on either Side, no private Revenge shall be taken for the same; but proper Application shall be made to his Majesty's Government upon the Place for Remedy or Redress thereof in a due course of Justice.</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We know all this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall say but one Thing more, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>You have had some doubt whether <HI>Medockawando</HI> was ever the Sachem of the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Tribe. We find about Fifty four Years ago in our History and Re∣cords that He was your Sachem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>He never was a Proprietor of Land here; and we have heard so often about him. We don't desire to hear any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you acknowledge that <HI>Winnemouet</HI> was your Sachem?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We don't know that he was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>One of our old Men, who is now with us here on the Spot was present when <HI>Madockawando</HI> signed the Deed of this Land where the Fort stands, and above a Hundred Indians most of whom were of the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Tribe were present and consenting to that Grant and saw the Money paid for the Land, a Hatt-full of Pieces of Eight, and sundry Blankets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We have heard of that very often, and if we should hear of it again, it would signify nothing; if we come to Agreement, we desire all those Things may be put under the Table.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not have you misunderstand me; the English are not a∣bout to settle any other Lands than what you have at two several Times agreed to in Conferences with some of the Proprietors in 1735.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We only mention the Affair of Lands to put you in mind of your Agreements not to go a Foot over the Line agreed to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have you rightly understand me; I can assure you, the Proprietors of that Land granted by <HI>Medockawondo,</HI> are not about settling any Lands on the East Side of this River.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As for our Part, we were always willing, when the English came here, that they should settle so as not to croud us in our Settlements. The French have desired to settle in our Rivers, but we would not grant it. We have shown more regard to the English, than any white People, being desirous to live in Friendship with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="004976_0015_100E4F2136AAB0A0"/>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>We don't desire to croud you in any of your Settlements.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We are more tender of the English than any People, and desire their Friendship; but would not be crowded nor croud them.</P>
<P>We greatly rejoice in your Excellency's last Speech.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>As this Government will always be careful that King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Subjects shall not take away an Inch of Land from you, so they will always sup∣port them in their Settlement of Lands to which they have a just Right and Pre∣tension; which you must acknowledge to be reasonable, for we shall always keep our Agreements with you, and expect you to keep your Agreements with all King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Subjects, both with respect to Lands and all other Matters.</P>
<P>As to your young Men killing the Horses; we as well as you are sorry for it. Your killing our Cattle does our Inhabitants as much Injury as our taking away your Bever and Guns; they being as necessary for our Support, as Hunting for yours.</P>
<P>The English have always expected, and you have always acknowledged, that when the young Men commit such Trespasses, they should make Reparation for such Damage done. If we should uphold and countenance our young Men, or you countenance yours in such Matters, it would soon break all Friendship be∣tween us. It is therefore necessary for us, when our young Men commit Tres∣passes that they should be obliged to make Restitution And it is as necessary that your young Men should be obliged to do the same in such Cases.</P>
<P>Since I have been here, I have received many Complaints from the Inhabitants that they have had their Cattle, Horses and Hoggs kill'd to a great Value.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron</SPEAKER>
<P>, It may be the Vermin have killed them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>Some Gentlemen of the Council have inquir'd into the Truth and Justice of the Complaints; and I have rejected all those that are not sup∣ported by Proof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>I know of my certain Knowledge, that Bears and Wolves have killed a great many.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>We therefore don't take Notice of any such Complaints, as are not certainly proved by Witnesses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the Horses mentioned Yesterday; they were killed by young Men, who found them at a great Distance from any Habitation; however they are pretty well paid for them, the Owners having their Guns; so we should be glad to have that Matter drop. For the future we shall take double Care; and Charge our young Men to do so no more: And we pray, that when the Cattle stray away, and are mir'd or hung in Crotches of Trees, your young Men may not charge us with killing of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="16" REF="004976_0016_100E4F236BAFC6E0"/>
<SPEAKER>GOVRENOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>We will take Care not to be impos'd upon by our young Men in that Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes the English desire us to look for their lost Cattle, and we find them dead. We ought not to be charged with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not reasonable you should.</P>
<P>But besides the Horses, one Mr. <HI>Kogg</HI> lost an Ox, which <HI>Ackumbuett's</HI> Sons own, they had killed before Witnesses. Another Ox was kili'd which Col. <HI>Lewis</HI> saw the Bones and Hoofs of, (two English Men being present.) As to our young Men making themselves Satisfaction for their Horses which were killed by taking away your Guns, we don't like it; because when either Side pretend to take their own Satisfaction, it will create Quarrels, and break Friendship; there∣fore the Method must be to complain to the Government, and leave to them to order proper Satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moxus,</SPEAKER>
<P>As for two of the Cattle kill'd by <HI>Ackumbuett's</HI> Son, and my Son; they were in Liquor, and hardly know what they did; when I came to know it I paid 25 s. for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>That Money was paid for a Horse and Steer that I have not mentioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moxus,</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true. I am mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the two Oxen which you acknowledge were killed, what Satisfaction do you propose to make for them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As for them, we believe our young Men killed them; and when we return, we shall have a Meeting, and see that they be paid for.</P>
<P>As to the Horses, the Guns we think may satisfy for them, and we should be glad to hear no more about that Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I have appointed two Gentlemen on Oath to apprize the value of the Oxen; and they have valued them at 40 <HI>l.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Col. Lewis</SPEAKER>
<P>, As to the Oxen I view'd the Bones; and don't think they were so big as Oxen's Bones, and therefore not worth so much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a Sloop come in here and she run aground: Two Canoes were coming along and the Sloop Men desired the Indians to help them, which they did; and for a Reward the Sloop Men made them drunk, put them on the Beach, and before they got sober they loft their Canoes and three Guns.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>We are inform'd, That the Indians came on board of their own accord; and would not leave the Vessel, though often desired, till they were Drunk; therefore ought to charge their Loss to their own Folly in drinking too much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="004976_0017_100E4F2539D6BB70"/>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We have been inform'd as I have said, and thought it true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I have many such Informations, even to the Amount of above three Hundred Pounds; but take no Notice of them because they are not suffi∣ciently proved.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As to these Things you have mentioned them; and they may be settled between two or three. And we desire to mention Things that may con∣tinue Friendship: And for the future, that strict Charges may be given on both Sides to the young Men to do so no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>The Inhabitants complain, that sometimes your young Men stop the Oxen and prevent their bringing Home their Hay.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We are old Men, and can't have our Eyes every where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>You ought to do all you can, to restrain your young Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We are loth to enter into little Complaints, about the English killing our Dogs, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> But are resolved on our Part to endeavour to prevent such Things for the future. You have an Advantage with regard to restraining your young Men, having better Government than we. But we will do what we can in these Matters.</P>
<P>There was something forgot about the Truck-Trade Yesterday. One Thing is, that the little Skins call'd Sable-Skins us'd to be sold for 10s.; but now for 8s. We desire they may be at the first Price.</P>
<P>Another about Bear-Skins, they grow scarce, and we can't afford to bring them at the customary Price.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the Sable-Skins, we did give 10s. a piece for, two Years ago, and sold them for 8s.; and now we can't get but 8s. Therefore as you have our Goods at the same or less Price than the People at <HI>Boston</HI>; so we ought to give no more for your Peltry than we can get for it there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>The Musquosh Skins sell but for 9<HI>d.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>We wish they would serch more with us, but they don't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>As to what we have said, your Excellency can't certainly determine with respect to the Truck-Masters, and the Men to view the Truck-Houses and the Interpreters. However, We hope you will appoint good Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>We will do that for our own sakes, as well as your's, it being of equal Service to us both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We desire we may mention one of the Gentleman to view the Truck∣Houses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="004976_0018_100E4F28501C1988"/>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>If you mention one I will consider of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>If we may have our desire we should choose Mr. <HI>Wheelwright</HI> for view∣ing, and Capt. <HI>Jordan</HI> for an Interpreter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I will consider of it, and gratify you as far as I am able.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We desire the Men may be suitable and Honest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>You may depend upon the Government to take care of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>Now we are come to the conclusion of the Conference, and we and all around us rejoice at the prospect of Union between us, and that we are like to live in Love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>We are very glad to hear you say so, and we hope that lasting Peace and Friendship will continue between us as it was design'd by Governour <HI>DUMMER's</HI> Treaty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Saco Indian,</SPEAKER>
<P>We desire that Mr. <HI>Cutter</HI> may continue in the Truck House, but not be absent so much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I will consider of that Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>We have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>GOVERNOUR,</SPEAKER>
<P>I have some Presents to make you from the Government; and I desire you will be here at the usual Signal in the Morning, when I shall present them: And desire afterwards your Tribes will dine with me, that we may snake Hands and depart in Peace.</P>
<P>I have ordered another Ox to be delivered to you to Day, and the usual Al∣lowance for Refreshment; and I hope nothing has been wanting in all your Entertainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron,</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing has been or can be wanting when your Excellency is present.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then His Excellency drank to the several Tribes King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Health, wishing the Peace now subsisting may continue so long as the Sun and Moon endures.</P>

We are so sensible of your Excellency's and the Governments Care of and Kindness to us, that we cannot express what is in our Breasts. We speak from our Hearts; and are now perfectly easy and satisfyed in our Minds: We harbour no Evil in our Breasts, but are sincere and upright in what we say; and could your Excellency look into our Hearts, you would not be able to find any corrupt Nature in us. We desire to live as Friends and Brothers; and that the Peace which we have now renewed and confirmed may last always.</Q>
