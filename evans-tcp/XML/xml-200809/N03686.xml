<Q><HI>Preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching those Things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all Con∣fidence; no Man forbidding him.</HI></Q>

<P>THE inspir'd Evangelist closes his entertain∣ing Narrative of the <HI>Acts of the Apostles</HI> with this remarkable and instructive Pas∣sage in the Story of the great <HI>Doctor of the Gentiles:</HI> who, from a Destroyer of the Faith and Persecutor of Christ, had long since, by the Grace of God bestowed upon him, become an Apostle of Christ, and Preacher of the Faith, yea a Sufferer for the Gospel; and was now evangelizing the famous City of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004510_0004_100D5E3185B332B0"/>
It had been foretold him in a Vision, that as he had testified of Christ at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he should bear Witness at <HI>Rome</HI> also. He had himself promis'd, and once and again purpos'd a Visit to the <HI>Romans;</HI> longing to <HI>have some Fruit among them, even as among other Gentiles.</HI> But being oblig'd to delay for a while, it seems as if some had tax'd him of <HI>using Lightness,</HI> in promising and not per∣forming; or we may suppose they might (like some at <HI>Corinth</HI> ) be <HI>puffed up, as though he would not come to them,</HI> either for Fear or Shame. Therefore he takes Occasion in his <HI>Epistle to the Romans</HI> (written while yet unknown by Face unto them) to make those solemn Protestations: <HI>I am a Debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, both to the Wise and to the Unwise; so, as much as in me is, I am</HI> READY <HI>to preach the Gospel to You that are at</HI> Rome <HI>also: for I am</HI> NOT ASHAMED <HI>of the Gospel of Christ.—From</HI> Jerusalem <HI>and round about unto</HI> Illyricum, <HI>I have</HI> FULLY <HI>preached the Gospel of Christ. And I am</HI> SURE, <HI>that when I come unto You, I shall come in the</HI> FULNESS <HI>of the Blessing of the Gospel of Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Agreably the Apostle was no sooner arrived among them, altho' under some uncomfortable Restraints and manifest Disadvantages, but he enters with Alacrity into this new Scene of Labours in the Word, shewing him∣self (as he had wrote) <HI>not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ,</HI> but <HI>ready to preach</HI> it even at <HI>Rome;</HI> neither re∣garding the Envy of any judaizing false Brethren of his own Communion there, nor the Malice of the unbelieving Jews; neither fearing the Power of pagan Idolaters, nor all the Sophistry of the Disputers of this World. Flesh and Blood indeed, had he consulted that, might have prompted him to Silence, as a prudent Caution, and the best Security, in his present critical Situation; being under a judicial Prosecution by his own Countrymen, condemned by the Jewish Priests as violating their Law and the Customs of their Fathers, and upon his Appeal to <HI>Cesar</HI> consign'd over into the Hands of the <HI>Romans.</HI>—But our christian Hero, at all Hazards, quickly begins his Testimony in <HI>Rome:</HI> and ceased not daily to teach and preach <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> He had too
<PB N="3" REF="004510_0005_100D5E330DC1CE08"/>
active a Genius, and too just a Sense of the Worth of Time, to sweel away any of his precious Hours in Sloth and Indolence; He had a most sensible Compassion for guilty perishing Souls, and he felt the Love of Christ pow∣erfully constraining him; Necessity was laid upon him; and he found the Spirit of Glory and of God now resting on him: So that, thus principl'd, thus fortify'd and ani∣mated, he apply'd himself to the Work of an Apostle without Delay, and pursued it with a steady Resolution, with ardent Zeal, and an indefatigable Industry; being in it sometimes <HI>from Morning till Evening,</HI> and continual∣ly in Labours more abundant. From <HI>Rome</HI> he seems to have wrote almost all his Epistles. And here he seems to have eminently devoted himself to the Ministry of the Word: <HI>preaching and teaching with all Confidence;</HI> and in∣deed <HI>no Man forbidding him.</HI></P>
<P>Liberty was indulg'd him by the Authority of the Place: And tho' he wanted not for Adversaries, they wanted the Courage or the Power to <HI>forbid</HI> and withstand him. Par∣ticularly the Men of his own Nation, who seem every where to have distinguished themselves for their Spleen and Rancour against this Apostle, and often had made Up∣roar, and Insurrection, and Conspiracy against him in his own Country, wou'd doubtless now also at <HI>Rome,</HI> if their Power had been equal to their Will, have thunder'd out Menaces and Prohibitions, and laid all possible Obstruc∣tions in the Way, to prevent his <HI>speaking in the Name of Jesus,</HI> or his preaching among the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> But <HI>Paul, a Prisoner of Jesus Christ,</HI> and a Stranger at <HI>Rome,</HI> happily found more Indulgence here, than at <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> being by the Favour of the <HI>Roman</HI> Captain suffered to <HI>dwell by himself</HI> (with a single Attendant) <HI>in his own hired House,</HI> to admit what Company he pleas'd, to preach as often as he would; and none permitted to disturb him.</P>
<P>[By the Way, here's a teaching <HI>Example</HI> to Men in Power, to countenance faithful Preachers of the Gospel: and how can persecuting <HI>Rome</HI> at this Day, reflect on it without Blushing and Confusion!]</P>
<P>This Liberty afforded the Apostle a glorious Oppor∣tunity: which he well knew how to value, and neg∣lected not to make Use of to the best Advantage. A
<PB N="4" REF="004510_0006_100D5E35F903DB10"/>
wide Door, and effectual, was here open'd to him, to send abroad the Sound of the Gospel: he quickly filled <HI>Rome</HI> with this Doctrine, and it reach'd even <HI>Caesar'</HI>s Household. Some of all Stations, Characters, and Cir∣cumstances (it seems) crouded to his Ministry, as the Doves flock to their Windows: And 'tis said here, like his Divine Master, <HI>he receiv'd all that came to him;</HI> whether Jew or Gentile, whether Male or Female, Old or Young, Bond or Free, Wise or Unwise: he re∣garded no Man's Person; he <HI>received all</HI> indifferently, without partial Respects or Disrepects, for their Nation, Condition, Rank, or Figure in the World. And <HI>how</HI> did he <HI>receive</HI> them? Was it only to good Fellowship, to pass away the Time together in empty Chatt and trifling Amusements! No.—Or was it to doubtful Disputati∣ons, to scholastick Babblings, and Oppositions of Sci∣ence, falsely so call'd! No.—Or was it to mercenary and selfish Ends, hoping for Money, or for Favour from 'em! No, nor this. But it was in pure Love, from a ge∣nerous and disinterested Zeal for their Good, hoping to win their Souls to Christ, and bring them to God. With this noble View he <HI>received</HI> them all. All that had Ears to hear, He receiv'd, to <HI>preach</HI> to them, and to <HI>teach</HI> them, as <HI>Jesus</HI> (it's said) <HI>received the People, and spake to them of the Kingdom of God.</HI> And this he did with great Fi∣delity, Freedom and Assurance; not asham'd of his Doctrine, nor balking the Truth; not sparing Vice, Error, or any Thing contrary to sound Doctrine; neither flattering the Vanity of the Great or Learned, nor despising the humble Condition of the Poor, or Illiterate. That's the Character of this Divine Apostle, in our Text; <HI>Preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching those Things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all Con∣fidence.</HI></P>
<P>We may more particularly observe here,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Matter</HI> of his <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Teachings,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>The</HI> KINGDOM <HI>of</HI> GOD, <HI>and the Things which concern the Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST.—Not the Wisdom of this World; not the Philosophy of the <HI>Greeks;</HI> nor yet the Righteousness of the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees.</HI>—Not the <HI>Rituals</HI> of <HI>Moses,</HI> or <HI>Traditions</HI> of the Fathers, to humour

his <HI>Jewish</HI> Brethren;—Not human <HI>Politicks,</HI> to please the Court;—Not liberal <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> to tickle the Scholars itching Ears;—Not mere <HI>Ethicks,</HI> or natu∣ral Religion, to gratify the heathen Moralists: No, but the important Truths and Precepts of the Gospel-Revela∣tion, <HI>The Kingdom of God, and the Things concerning Jesus Christ.</HI> These momentous and sublime Subjects were the reigning Themes of his publick Ministry and private Con∣verse. <HI>On these two</HI> Arguments <HI>hang all the Law and the Prophets,</HI> the Gospel and the Apostles. Here's the Cen∣tre of <HI>Revelation:</HI> Here's the Sum of <HI>Christianity:</HI> And here's an inexhaustible Fund of the most useful Preaching and Conversation. These are Things that <HI>Angels</HI> are Stu∣dents in; but not able fully to comprehend.</P>
<P>Observe,</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Manner</HI> of his <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Teaching,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>with all</HI> CONFIDENCE.</P>
<P>A Door was now open'd to him of the Lord; a Door of Opportunity, and a Door of Utterance: and he spake <HI>boldly</HI> the Mysteries of God. Sometimes he remarks it to the Churches, that he had been <HI>with them in Weakness, and in Fear, and in much Trembling:</HI> tho' never to that Degree as to hinder him from declaring to them the Testimony of God, and triumphing in Christ. It seems, even inspir'd <HI>Apostles</HI> had not the Presence of the Comfor∣ter with them always in an exact Proportion. But in some Places, and on some Occasions, they had the <HI>Joy of the Holy Ghost</HI> in signal Measures, so that at such times they remarkably <HI>waxed bold:</HI> and never perhaps was <HI>Paul</HI> more <HI>thorowly made manifest,</HI> than among the <HI>Romans.</HI> His Speech and his Preaching was now very eminently <HI>in Demonstration of the Spirit, and of Power.</HI> His Faith seems now triumphant, and to spread all its Glories upon him. He needed a peculiar Presence of God, to support him under the Weight of that uncommon Service (private, as well as publick) which he must have upon his Hands in so great and populous a City, while <HI>all</HI> Comers at all Seasons had free Access to him.—Here too he had some of the most subtle and powerful <HI>Adversaries,</HI> to conflict with; Here he had his <HI>Martyrdom</HI> in the nearest Pros∣pect; and here one of the bitterest Trials was to befall
<PB N="6" REF="004510_0008_100D5E3AC55CE4F0"/>
him, the <HI>Desertion of Friends:</HI> on all which Accounts, as he remarkably needed <HI>his Lord to stand by him, and strengthen him,</HI> so he had now a very remarkable Expe∣rience of the gracious Presence of Christ, which gave him Utterance and a Fortitude extraordinary. So that even in learned proud and imperious <HI>Rome</HI> he <HI>was</HI> bold in his God, to make known the Mysteries of the Gospel; and preach'd Christianity with much Power, with a victorious Faith, and intrepid Assurance. He preach'd the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> tho' amidst <HI>Idol-Temples,</HI> and near the Palace of <HI>Cesar,</HI> as jealous as he was for the Dignity of his Crown, or the Priests and Populace for the Honour of their Idols. The Apostle, while he was for allowing to <HI>Cesar</HI> the Things that were <HI>Cesar'</HI>s, yet boldly claim'd for GOD the Things that are GOD'S, and for CHRIST the Things that are CHRIST'S, in Opposition to the Works of the Devil, and the Usurpations of Men. He dar'd preach the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> in the <HI>Imperial</HI> City, the Mistress of the World, and the Mother of Abomina∣tions. And here he triumph'd in <HI>Christ,</HI> tho' despised of Men. He glory'd in the <HI>Cross of Christ,</HI> though to the <HI>Jews</HI> a Stumbling-block, and to the <HI>Greeks</HI> Foolishness. They might pour Contempt on the Doctrine of a <HI>crucify'd Saviour,</HI> and a <HI>Kingdom not of this World▪</HI> but he saw a Divine Glory in the Gospel, and counting all Things but Loss, for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Jesus, he <HI>preach'd the Things concerning Christ, and the Kingdom of God, with all Confidence,</HI> with the full Assurance of Faith, and the Rejoicing of Hope firm to the End; free from all anxious Diffidence, Reluctance, Fear, or Shame; and surmounting all Discouragements.</P>
<P>Perhaps (by the Way) this his heroic <HI>Confidence</HI> might be one Occasion of that happy Circumstance, <HI>No Man forbidding him:</HI> for they might as well attempt to stay the Sun in the Heavens from its Course, as go about to forbid the Progress of this bold and zealous Preacher in his Work, who like the Sun was a burning and shining Light, and in the daily Revolutions of his Ministry went forth in the Strength of the Lord, rejoicing as a strong Man to run a Race. But <HI>the good Hand of his God upon him,</HI> is principally to be ey'd in this remarkable
<PB N="7" REF="004510_0009_100D5E3CED45EB88"/>
Concurrence of Events; the Boldness of the Apostle, and the Tameness of his Adversaries. The God that stopt the Mouths of ravening Lions, in the Case of <HI>Daniel,</HI> made all Iniquity to stop her Mouth, in the Case of this Apostle, and <HI>delivered him out of the Mouth of the Lion.</HI> So it was that God, who maketh Man's Mouth; even He, who put forth his Hand, and touched <HI>Jeremiah'</HI>s Mouth; He, who sent one of the Seraphim, with a live-Coal from off the Altar, to touch <HI>Isaiah'</HI>s Lips, and made his Mouth like a sharp Sword; 'twas the same Hand of God, that open'd the Mouth of this Apo∣stle, and gave him that good Treasure he had within, of Knowledge, Grace and Comfort, so that out of the Abundance of his Heart, his Mouth spake, <HI>of the King∣dom of God, and the Things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all Confidence.</HI></P>
<P>Having held you thus long in reflecting on the Con∣text, and descanting on the Words,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>This long Introduction has sundry Passages in it, which I have taken the Liberty to insert here, though for Brevity omitted in the preaching.—I've done the like in some of the following Pages.</HI> </NOTE> I shall wave all other Observations that might be made from them, and single out this one for the Theme of our further Medi∣tations.</P>

<P>The special Occasion, which has led my Tho'ts to this Subject, you are all aware of; and will expect no other Apology.—In discoursing upon this Doctrine, I shall take the following Method: Premising, that <HI>the Gospel reveals to us the Kingdom of God, and those Things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> then shewing, that <HI>Ministers of the Gospel are to preach and teach these Things;</HI> and this <HI>with all holy Confidence.</HI>—To each in their Order, as briefly as will well consist with doing any Justice to Points of such Importance.</P>

PROP. I. The Gospel reveals to us <HI>the Kingdom of God and those Things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Here it may be said distinctly,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Gospel reveals to us <HI>the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>And if it be inquired, <HI>What</HI> Kingdom? I answer,</P>
<P N="1">(1). It reveals to us a Kingdom of <HI>Providence,</HI> which extends thro' the universal <HI>Creation.</HI></P>
<P>It tells us, that <HI>God hath prepared his Throne in the Hea∣vens, and his Kingdom ruleth over all:</HI> reaches thro' all Worlds, Heaven, Earth, and Hell. The Doctrine of a Divine Providence is the Dictate of Reason, as well as Revelation: tho' the Glories of this Providential Do∣minion are vail'd to the Eye of natural Reason. It ap∣pears but <HI>a base Kingdom,</HI> without the Gospel to shew us the Mysteries of it.—Nor can we by the Light of Na∣ture learn <HI>the Manner of the Kingdom,</HI> as administred by <HI>Jesus,</HI> the Mediator; to whom all Power in Heaven and Earth is committed, and who hath the Keys of Hell and of Death. This is one of the <HI>Peculiars</HI> of Reve∣lation: a Doctrine of Christianity, full of Mystery and Glory, and big with Lessons of Duty.—But it is not the Kingdom of <HI>Nature,</HI> the Dominion of <HI>Providence,</HI> in any View of it, that our Text has so direct a Re∣ference to.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The Gospel reveals to us a Kingdom of <HI>Grace,</HI> which extends only to the Church and peculiar People of God in the Earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> spoken of in our Text, and which is so celebrated a Subject in Revelation, means in general the Dispensation of Redemption by Christ; and particu∣larly that <HI>mediatory Dominion of Grace,</HI> which concerns <HI>Souls</HI> in this World, and which our <HI>Lord-Redeemer</HI> ex∣ercises over them by his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>The Metaphor of a <HI>Kingdom</HI> is chosen to shadow out the <HI>Excellencies</HI> of this Dispensation of Grace; and par∣ticularly to represent the glorious Rectitude, the beauti∣ful and blessed State of Things in a <HI>renewed Soul.</HI> It imports a Throne erected, a Divine Authority exercised, and a Divine Power exerted; a Law written, Allegiance sworn, and Homage paid; a comely Order and Harmony restored; a Pardon dispens'd, and Peace spoken; Privi∣leges
<PB N="9" REF="004510_0011_100D5E40D14AF8B0"/>
and Honours confer'd; great and precious Pro∣mises apply'd: a vital Union to Christ, the Head of his Body, the Church; and I may add, an Union of Hearts among all the Subjects of this Kingdom; and, what crowns all, the Stability of this Dominion and Happiness. For the <HI>Foundation of God standeth sure: The Lord knoweth them that are his.</HI> The <HI>Throne of Christ</HI> in his People's Hearts <HI>shall endure for ever;</HI> and <HI>the Gates of Hell shall not be able to prevail against it.</HI> This Kingdom of Grace in the Soul, is <HI>a Kingdom that cannot be de∣stroyed:</HI> molested it may be, but not dissolv'd.</P>
<P>This is sometimes called <HI>the</HI> Kingdom, by way of Eminence; because it is incomparable for true Glory, Happiness, and Duration; and because this was <HI>that</HI> King∣dom, the diffusive Spread and flourishing State whereof the <HI>Old Testament Prophecies</HI> spake of, upon which the <HI>Jews</HI> founded their Expectation of the <HI>Kingdom's being re∣stored to Israel,</HI> tho' their Notion of the Thing was all carnal and worldly.</P>
<P>'Tis sometimes call'd the <HI>Heavenly</HI> Kingdom; because in its Nature it partakes of <HI>Heaven,</HI> and prepares us for it, tends to it, and ends in it.</P>
<P>'Tis call'd in our Text, and elsewhere, the Kingdom of <HI>God:</HI> because it is of a divine <HI>Nature,</HI> and of a di∣vine <HI>Original,</HI> resulting from the Purpose of Divine <HI>Grace</HI> from everlasting, contriv'd by divine <HI>Wisdom,</HI> effected by Divine <HI>Power,</HI> and exhibiting the Image of Divine <HI>Ho∣liness;</HI> because the Divine <HI>Sovereignty</HI> is here display'd in its brightest Glory; because a <HI>Submission</HI> to God is the great Law of this Kingdom, and the <HI>Fruition</HI> of God is the great Reward of its Subjects; because the <HI>Righte∣ousness,</HI> which is of God by Faith, is the grand Basis of this Kingdom; the <HI>Word</HI> of God, the Charter of its Privileges; the <HI>Christ</HI> of God, the Purchaser, and the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, the Bestower of them: in fine, because this Kingdom stands in direct Opposition to the Kingdom of <HI>Satan,</HI> the god of this World; is above the Reach of human Usurpation, and infinitely excells all the King∣doms of the <HI>Sons of Men.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Kingdom</HI> spoken of in our Text, is primarily of a <HI>moral spiritual</HI> Kind, an <HI>inward</HI> Thing, <HI>in the hidden Man of the Heart.</HI> It's a Kingdom <HI>not of this World,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="004510_0012_100D5E430EDCA830"/>
as our Saviour assures us; not of an earthly and temporal Reference; not lying in Civils, and mere Externals; not having Men's natural Lives, Liberties, and Properties in this World, for the immediate Object of its Dominion: No, but it is a Kingdom <HI>within</HI> Men, a Kingdom in the Soul, a Rule over the Understanding and Will, the Heart and Conscience; rectifying and conducting the Powers of the <HI>inner Man;</HI> a Kingdom of heavenly Light and Love, and filial Liberty <HI>within;</HI> a Kingdom that consists (as the Apostle expresses it) <HI>in Righteous∣ness, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI>—It is a Kingdom set up in Honour of <HI>God, our Saviour;</HI> that the Son of God may <HI>manifest his Glory,</HI> in destroying the Prince of this World, and that Men may with their <HI>Heart,</HI> as well as Lips, <HI>honour the Son, even as they honour the Father</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Having multiply'd Scripture-Quotations in this Dis∣course, I have for Brevity often omitted citing</HI> Book, Chapter <HI>and</HI> Verse.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Tis to be observ'd, that the Kingdom of Grace may be consider'd as in some Respects under an <HI>outward</HI> and visible, as well as an <HI>inward</HI> and invisible Administration.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> sometimes in Scripture seems to be meant the <HI>visible</HI> Kingdom of Christ, or the <HI>exter∣nal</HI> Administration of his spiritual Government in the Church, mediately by his Word and Ordinances: as where we read of the <HI>Kingdom's</HI> being <HI>taken away;</HI> the <HI>Children of the Kingdom,</HI> their being <HI>cast out,</HI> &amp;c.—The <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> of this outward Polity are exhi∣bited to us in the sacred <HI>Scriptures:</HI> The <HI>Subjects</HI> of it are visible Saints: One eminent <HI>Sign</HI> or Badge of it is the holy <HI>Sabbath:</HI> An <HI>Oath</HI> of Allegiance to the King of <HI>Zion</HI> is administer'd in <HI>Baptism,</HI> and a <HI>Recognition</HI> of the Vows of God upon us solemnly made at the <HI>Lord's Table: Societies</HI> for Communion in Worship, Church-Order, and Discipline, are instituted: and <HI>Officers</HI> ap∣pointed, with a subordinate ministerial Power, to lead and preside in <HI>the House of the Kingdom</HI> &amp;c.—Now the Kingdom of God, in this Notion of it, we must take
<PB N="11" REF="004510_0013_100D5E46317894D0"/>
Heed that we don't reject, or slight: but acknowlege Christ's kingly Authority in his visible Church and out∣ward Ordinances, by <HI>a professed Subjection to the Gospel,</HI> and by a Care to <HI>walk in all his Commandments and In∣stitutions, blameless.</HI> We must make it our Concern and Study, to <HI>hold fast the Form of sound Words,</HI> and to <HI>keep the Ordinances as they have been delivered to us; confessing Christ before Men,</HI> and honouring him by all due Ac∣knowlegements in external Practice.—It's usual to say, There's the <HI>visible Kingdom of God</HI> among a People so doing.</P>
<P>We may note here, The <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> as to it's external Appearance, Form, or Mode, has pass'd under a Variety of Dispensations, Revolutions and Degrees of Advancement, since its original Foundation. The King∣dom has ever been substantially one; but administer'd at sundry Times in divers Manners. The last, and pre∣sent, which is commonly nam'd the <HI>Gospel-Dispensation,</HI> the Kingdom of <HI>Jesus,</HI> the Son of God incarnate, is the most perfect of all. This was long lookt for by the <HI>Jews;</HI> tho' they had wrong Ideas of its Nature and Design. We read of devout Men among them, <HI>who waited for the Kingdom of God.</HI> And the Pharisees in∣quir'd the Time, <HI>when the Kingdom of God should come;</HI> meaning, when the <HI>Messiah</HI> would inherit the Throne of his Father <HI>David,</HI> and introduce his expected Reign.</P>
<P>It's thought by some, this <HI>visible</HI> Dispensation of the Gospel is only intended, where Christ says to the unbe∣lieving Pharisees, <HI>No Doubt the Kingdom of God is come upon you;</HI> and concerning the <HI>little Children</HI> bro't to him, <HI>Of such is the Kingdom of God.</HI> So where the chri∣stian <HI>Hebrews</HI> are said to have <HI>received a Kingdom which cannot be moved;</HI> and the <HI>Colossians</HI> to be <HI>delivered from the Power of Darkness, and translated into the Kingdom of God's dear Son.</HI>—But I can't help thinking, altho' <HI>that</HI> Sense be comprehended, yet there's a richer and more ex∣alted Sense, which is by no means to be excluded, in the most (if not all) of these, and other such Passages.</P>
<P>If we wou'd <HI>speak of the Glory of God's Kingdom, and talk of his Power,</HI> we must turn our Eye to the <HI>inward</HI> and <HI>vital</HI> Dispensation. The <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> consider'd subjectively, is in its general Notion the same with what
<PB N="12" REF="004510_0014_100D5E48695F3B78"/>
is elsewhere denominated the <HI>New Creature, the Image of God,</HI> &amp;c. It means that System of heavenly Graces, in∣wrought in the Soul by the Power of God, in Conver∣sion. And how great is its Beauty and Worth, its Impor∣tance and Necessity! The <HI>Externals</HI> of the Kingdom are, in their Order and Place, truly excellent and highly amiable. <HI>His Foundation is in the holy Mountains: The Lord loveth the Gates of</HI> Zion, <HI>more than all the Dwellings of</HI> Jacob: <HI>Glorious Things are spoken of thee, O City of God.</HI> But among all its Glories, this is the most remar∣kable; <HI>Of</HI> Zion <HI>it shall be said, This and that Man was</HI> BORN <HI>in her.</HI>—What are all the visible Beauties and Benefits of the outward Dispensation, to those of the secret invisible Empire of God, set up in a Soul, in the <HI>new</HI> BIRTH! <HI>The King's Daughter is all glorious</HI> WITHIN. As for the Glory of <HI>external</HI> Advantages, it lies in their being Divine Appointments, and wisely adapted Means, own'd and sanctify'd of God, to subserve the blessed Purposes of his Grace, in regard to the <HI>internal</HI> Dispensation. They are a noble <HI>Apparatus</HI> &amp; <HI>Attendant</HI> to this: but <HI>sepa∣rate</HI> from this, the <HI>external</HI> Frame of Christianity fails of its genuine Use and End; and in that Regard hath no Glory, however splendid an Appearance it may make. The visible Dispensation of the Covenant of Grace, without the invisible Work of Grace in the Heart; the mere <HI>Form of Godliness,</HI> tho' brighten'd with the fair Shew of all homiletical Virtues, giving Persons or Soci∣eties <HI>a Name that they live;</HI> This is certainly but the Shadow, not the Substance and Reality of the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI>—Reigning <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> (which is consistent with the Height of external Zeal in Offices of Devotion and Duties of moral Practice) determines Men real Slaves to the <HI>Prince of Darkness:</HI> and we have Reason to fear, many a Church on Earth, that calls it self a Church of <HI>Christ,</HI> is indeed little else but a <HI>Synagogue of Satan.</HI> However highly they may make their Boast in God and his Kingdom, little more can be said, than that <HI>the King∣dom of God is come nigh them.</HI>—We may, in regard of Convictions and Reformation, be <HI>not far from the King∣dom of God;</HI> and yet in Fact not <HI>receive</HI> it. Neverthe∣less, where there's a truly prosperous State of <HI>Externals</HI> in
<PB N="13" REF="004510_0015_100D5E49F0971258"/>
Religion, it's to be hop'd, there is usually the <HI>secret</HI> Work of Grace carrying on, and so the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> in Reality.</P>
<P><HI>Receiving</HI> the Kingdom of God, means a vital Appli∣cation and active Assumption; most aptly expressing the Nature and Operation of <HI>Faith,</HI> which is a receptive and accepting Grace; whose Seat is in the <HI>Heart</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> and whose Office is to <HI>receive Christ Jesus the Lord, our Righteousness.</HI>—The <HI>Soul</HI> of Man is the prime Object of the whole Administration of this Kingdom; and it is in its whole Genius &amp; Frame <HI>spiritual,</HI> suited to our immortal Part.—The <HI>Law</HI> of this Kingdom is spiritual: I mean <HI>the royal Law of Liberty, the Law written, not with Ink, nor in Tables of Stone, but in fleshly Tables of the Heart;</HI> reaching to the inmost Recesses of the Soul, and <HI>bringing into Captivity every Thought to the Obedience of Christ.</HI>—The <HI>Service of the Kingdom</HI> is in its Nature, its Principles and Motives, spiritual: 'Tis a worshiping God <HI>in Spirit and in Truth,</HI> a serving Him <HI>with our Spirit</HI> in the Gospel of his Son.—The <HI>Privileges</HI> of this Kingdom are <HI>spi∣ritual Blessings</HI> and <HI>heavenly Things in Christ Jesus.</HI> 'Tis a Kingdom <HI>in</HI> this World, but not <HI>of</HI> it, not derivative from it, nor terminating in it, not participating of it, nor dependent upon it.—Its <HI>Properties,</HI> its <HI>Effects</HI> and <HI>Ends,</HI> are all sublime and spiritual.—The distinguishing <HI>Character</HI> of such as have <HI>receiv'd</HI> this Kingdom is, <HI>They that be spiritual; spiritually minded, walking in the Spirit,</HI> &amp;c.—Which leads me to observe, The grand Operator, in setting up and advancing this Kingdom, is the blessed <HI>Spirit of Grace:</HI> He is the immediate Agent, and (strict∣ly speaking) the sole Efficient. Indeed the Apostle some∣times intitles Ministers <HI>Fellow-workers to the Kingdom of God:</HI> But this is to be understood of their Employment in the <HI>external</HI> Administration. For they have not, by any Art of their own, an Access to the <HI>Hearts</HI> of Men; nor Power, as of themselves, to produce the Kingdom of God <HI>within</HI> Men. In respect of this Effect, the same Apostle confesses himself <HI>Nothing:</HI> but <HI>glories in his Infirmities, that the Power of Christ might rest upon him. We have this Treasure</HI> (says he) <HI>in earthen Vessels, that the Excel∣lency of the Power may be of God, and not of Men.</HI> And
<PB N="14" REF="004510_0016_100D5E4CA2C50040"/>
when it pleases God to <HI>send forth the Spirit of his Son into our Hearts,</HI> exerting his Divine Influences in Concurrence with the Ministry of the Word, it is seen that <HI>the King-of God is not in Word, but in Power.</HI> The holy Ghost with unerring Wisdom &amp; Skill conducts the Affairs of this spiritual Kingdom; and with uncontroulable Liberty, with an Energy invincible, and overpowering all Opposi∣tion, he prosecutes the glorious Designs of it: sets it up in Regeneration, and carries it on in progressive Sanctifi∣cation.—But in the whole He acts in Subordination to the <HI>Son of God,</HI> who is represented as the supreme Trustee of Divine Power, and prime Head of Influences, whom the Father hath <HI>set King on his holy Hill of</HI> Zion. <HI>Unto the</HI> SON <HI>he saith, Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever: Sit thou at my right Hand, until I make thine Enemies thy Footstool: Thy People shall be willing in the Day of thy Power.</HI></P>
<P>Let it be subjoin'd here; This is a Kingdom that is daily carrying on among Men, and shall be commensurate in <HI>Duration</HI> with Earth and Time, yea with Heaven and Eternity. Indeed when the World ends, and the whole Scene of Temporals is shut up, the <HI>present Manner</HI> of ad∣ministring this spiritual Dominion will <HI>cease:</HI> the <HI>Mode</HI> of Exercise will be alter'd, but the <HI>Dominion</HI> it self shall have <HI>no End,</HI> and its <HI>Effects</HI> never cease. This Kingdom is call'd the EVERLASTING <HI>Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI> He will doubtless be for ever, in some Sense, <HI>Head</HI> of his own Body, the Church; 'tis the Reward of his meritorious Passion and Obedience. Yet it's the Opinion of Divines, that the <HI>Mediatorial</HI> Form of administring the Government will utterly expire; which they ground on that Text, <HI>Then shall the Son deliver up the Kingdom to the Father.</HI> Though, this may only mean Christ's <HI>presenting</HI> to the Father his spiritual <HI>Subjects,</HI> his <HI>peculiar People</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>In familiar Language,</HI> Kingdom <HI>is taken</HI> objectively, <HI>for the govern'd Community; as well as formally, for the governing Power and Constitution.</HI> </NOTE> (who are describ'd a <HI>Royal Priesthood, a Kingdom of Priests</HI> ) the <HI>Church,</HI> that he <HI>loved, and gave himself for;</HI> the same, it's said, He <HI>will present to</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="004510_0017_100D5E4F93745CA8"/>
HIMSELF <HI>a glorious Church.</HI>—Then most evidently and emphatically <HI>God shall be all in all.</HI> The whole World of the Redeemed shall be <HI>filled</HI> with <HI>all</HI> the communicable <HI>Fulness of the Godhead.</HI> So the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> shall be perfect; arriv'd at its absolute Completion in Glory, a Glory that will never pass away.</P>
<P>This brings me to say,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The Gospel reveals to us a Kingdom of <HI>Glory,</HI> in the future and eternal World.</P>
<P>This Kingdom is administred in <HI>Heaven,</HI> the Seat of God's glorious Presence, and m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> beatific Influx. The Gospel acquaints us, that it was <HI>prepared from the Foun∣dation of the World;</HI> declares it the <HI>Purchase</HI> of the Cross of Christ; makes the <HI>Promise</HI> of it to them that are in Christ; pronounces <HI>Jesus</HI> the <HI>Fore-runner,</HI> who is for us entred into it, and set down with his Father in his Throne; proclaims <HI>Jesus</HI> the final <HI>Judge,</HI> the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> and the <HI>Life;</HI> in a Word, reveals the incarnate SON of God, as together with the FATHER, and the SPIRIT (One God over all, blessed for ever) the <HI>eternal</HI> Object of Worship and Happiness to the Saints in Light. Hence these are represented as standing before the <HI>Throne of God and the Lamb,</HI> reigning with Him <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Priests</HI> for ever.</P>
<P>But what is <HI>the Manner of the Kingdom</HI> above, what it's peculiar Laws and Methods of Administration (whether in the present State of separate Souls, or the future Re∣surrection-State) and what its admirable Immunities, divine Treasures, exalted Honours, Delights, &amp; verily <HI>Eye hath not seen, neither Ear heard,</HI> nor of these Things is <HI>the Heart of Man,</HI> in this our degenerate and feeble Con∣dition, capable of forming or admitting any exact and ad∣equate Ideas.—Only the Gospel reveals so much as suf∣ficiently assures us, in the general, it is a Kingdom of in∣finite Glory, immense Riches, and ecstatick Pleasures without End.—<HI>Enough</HI> this, in the Sense of inlighten'd Reason, to draw our Attention, to attract our Desires, and warm our Affections, to excite our Hopes, and en∣gage us in the Pursuit of this Kingdom of God: <HI>Enough,</HI> to nourish the Saints Faith and Love and spiritual Life, to refresh us in our Pilgrim-State, to ease our Griefs, and silence our Complaints, while under many Burdens, and
<PB N="16" REF="004510_0018_100D312A279E0760"/>
through mighty Oppositions, we are walking in the <HI>nar∣row Way,</HI> which leads to the Kingdom.—Thus much concerning it we have reveal'd to us, with infallible Cer∣tainty: and nothing further was really needful for us at present to know. What of the <HI>Glory</HI> remains <HI>to be revealed,</HI> we shall <HI>know hereafter.</HI></P>
<P>Let it be observ'd now, Thô this State of <HI>Glory</HI> in Hea∣ven be ultimately respected in our Text; yet it's the State of <HI>Grace</HI> here on Earth, that is more immediately in View. <HI>The Kingdom,</HI> thô a <HI>heavenly</HI> Kingdom, thô <HI>not of this World</HI> (neither establish'd on a worldly Design, nor having its Issue in the present World) yet has its Ex∣istence and Operation here.—This spiritual Kingdom has been erected and supported among Mankind <HI>from the Beginning:</HI> taking the Date of its <HI>Projection</HI> from the Days of <HI>Eternity,</HI> but of its actual <HI>Rise</HI> from the Days of our <HI>first Parents,</HI> commencing with that primitive and fundamental Promise made upon their Fall, <HI>That the Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpent's Head.</HI>—All a∣long thrô the <HI>Patriarchal</HI> and <HI>Jewish</HI> Ages, there was in one Degree or another the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> among Men. Yet the most illustrious Dispensation of it was reserv'd to be the Distinction of the Church's <HI>last Age.</HI> Says our Lord, <HI>From the Days of</HI> John Baptist <HI>the Kingdom of God is preached, and every Man presseth into it.</HI> But in the Days of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> after Christ's Ascension, this was eminently the Case. Then was that Saying of our Lord fulfilled, <HI>I tell you there be some standing here, which shall not taste of Death, until they have seen the Kingdom of God come with</HI> POWER. Truly, then was there an extraordi∣nary Display of the Power of God, in a quick Progress of his spiritual Kingdom, in its wide Extent, and in the transcendent Degree of its Prosperity and Glory, as to the Internals, as well as Externals of it. Then Conversions were numerous; <HI>Thousands</HI> at a Time <HI>added to the Lord; Nations born in a Day.</HI> And the Converts of <HI>Zion,</HI> in that happy Season, appear to have had the Spirit in emi∣nent Measures. Not to mention their miraculous Gifts, it seems their heavenly Graces were in general very sig∣nally in a flourishing State; having a Vitality, a sensible Growth &amp; Evidence, beyond what's common.—O when
<PB N="17" REF="004510_0019_100D5E534F73AC58"/>
shall we see the Return of such triumphant <HI>Days of the Son of Man!</HI> By the Grace of God we have a Prospect of another blessed Period, that will even <HI>exceed in Glory:</HI> when the <HI>everlasting Gospel</HI> shall <HI>fly like Lightning,</HI> with resistless Power and astonishing Success; shall again be preach'd <HI>with the Holy Ghost sent down from Heaven</HI> in a remarkable Manner, and <HI>the Kingdom of God</HI> be every where diffus'd and establish'd thrô all the Earth; when <HI>the Kingdom and the Greatness of the Kingdom shall be given to the People of the Saints of the most High.</HI> We shou'd pray for the hastning of those glorious <HI>Times of Reformation.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time we have it to acknowlege unto the Praise of a sovereign God, that there is <HI>even now a Rem∣nant according to the Election of Grace,</HI> and a promising Appearance of the Increase of their Number, who have <HI>receiv'd the Kingdom of God,</HI> thô in lower Measures. For this <HI>heavenly Kingdom</HI> as it now exists and appears in Be∣lievers, especially in its Beginnings, seems in general com∣paratively but as <HI>a Grain of Mustard-Seed,</HI> in regard to its <HI>small</HI> Figure, and at least oftentimes but as <HI>Leven hid in Meel,</HI> with regard to its <HI>secret</HI> Operation; yet there's the Reality, and a gradual Prevalence. Every one that is <HI>born of the Spirit,</HI> does actually <HI>see the Kingdom of God,</HI> in its initial Dispensation. To such it's given to <HI>know</HI> vitally and experimentally <HI>the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> For it must be noted, that (properly speaking) the Kingdom of <HI>Grace</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Glory</HI> are not <HI>two</HI> Kingdoms, specifically or essentially distinct; but only differing gradually, and in respect of their various Modes of Administration: Otherwise, they are for Sub∣stance one and the same, and go under the common Name of the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> The State of <HI>Grace,</HI> and the State of <HI>Glory,</HI> are not only connected inviolably in the Purpose and Covenant of God, but also nearly re∣lated, and united in their general Nature. <HI>Heaven</HI> comes down into the Soul in <HI>Regeneration;</HI> this is the actual Commencement of heavenly Bliss. The Kingdom of <HI>Grace</HI> is the Kingdom of <HI>Glory</HI> in its inchoate and imper∣fect Estate. And what's the Kingdom of <HI>Glory,</HI> but the Kingdom <HI>Grace</HI> in its Consummation, its triumphant State, and full display under a varying Form of Admini∣stration?</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="004510_0020_100D5E557AD44998"/>
I shall now close this Point with suggesting a few practical <HI>Reflections.</HI></P>
<P>By this we see the <HI>forlorn</HI> and <HI>wretched</HI> State of Souls <HI>unregenerate,</HI> in that they are Strangers to the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> in this World; and continuing so, must <HI>necessarily</HI> be excluded the Kingdom of God in the next.—By this we see how <HI>happy</HI> is the Day of a Sinner's <HI>Conversion,</HI> and the Occasion there is for <HI>Joy</HI> at every spiritual <HI>Birth,</HI> when a Soul is initiated into the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI>—We see the Reason of believing <HI>Parents</HI> so anxiously <HI>weeping for their Children</HI> while in a State of Nature, and <HI>travail∣ing in Birth again, until Christ be formed in them, the Kingdom of God</HI> set up in their Souls.—What <HI>honoura∣ble</HI> Sentiments should we have of the <HI>Saints,</HI> thô <HI>poor</HI> in this World, yet <HI>rich</HI> in Faith, and Heirs of the <HI>King∣dom!</HI>—And what mutual <HI>Endearment</HI> ought there ever to subsist between all these! <HI>These,</HI> who are <HI>Compa∣nions in the Kingdom and Patience of Jesus Christ</HI> here, and will hereafter be Companions for ever in the <HI>Kingdom and Joy of their Lord.</HI>—Let it be added; while we re∣flect with Grief and Shame on our Apostacy and Fall in <HI>Adam</HI> (by whom came <HI>Sin</HI> into the World, and by this the Kingdom of the <HI>Devil,</HI> that wicked Spirit which rules in the Children of Disobedience ever since) we shou'd ad∣mire and magnify the stupendous Wisdom and Grace of God in raising up a <HI>second Adam,</HI> to repair the suffering Honour of his violated Law, to dethrone the Enemy of our Souls, and <HI>restore the Kingdom to Israel.</HI>—And shou'd we not with equal Wonder and Praise celebrate the infi∣nite <HI>Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ!</HI> who hath <HI>restored that which be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not away,</HI> and has done this at the Ex∣pence of his own precious <HI>Blood;</HI> by the Merit of which he <HI>purchased</HI> the Kingdom of God, and in Virtue of which he receiv'd Power, in his risen State, to <HI>dispense</HI> the hea∣venly Blessing to whom he will; even to <HI>as many as the Father hath given him</HI> for a peculiar People to himself. The <HI>Kingdom is the Lord's;</HI> his Property, and at his Dispose. Hence that of Christ to his Disciples, <HI>I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed to me a Kingdom.</HI> And we read, <HI>Him hath God exalted with his right Hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give Repentance unto Israel,
<PB N="19" REF="004510_0021_100D5E57C2D7C0B0"/>
and Remission of Sins:</HI> which two Redemption-Blessings are the leading Benefits of the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> the first royal Donatives of our <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Saviour.</HI> O what Rea∣sons of Adoration and Thanksgiving to Christ do these Reflections present to us! Shall we not all join in the Cry of the Multitude that followed him at his triumphant En∣trance into <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> saying, <HI>Hosanna! Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord: Blessed be the Kingdom of our Father</HI> David, <HI>that cometh in the Name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest!</HI></P>
<P>But in many of these Hints I have been insensibly an∣ticipating the proper Thoughts on the other Article before us: which therefore I shall be the briefer upon.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Gospel reveals to us <HI>those Things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>By the Light of Reason we have some Notions of the Being and Perfections of God, and his Kingdom of Pro∣vidence: but <HI>the Kingdom of God,</HI> intended in our Text, and <HI>the Things that concern the Lord Jesus Christ</HI> (which do abundantly improve and add to rational Light in the Things of Nature and Providence) are discoverable only by the supernatural Light of Revelation. <HI>The Kingdom of God</HI> is a Kingdom of Grace, constituted and administred <HI>according to the Counsel of his own Will:</HI> And hence Di∣vine Revelation was necessary to the Knowledge of that. So <HI>the Things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> are Matters of pure Revelation: such as the natural Reason of Man cou'd never have brought to Light. 'Tis the ap∣propriate Glory of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> to reveal these Things to the Sons of Men.</P>
<P>And what a rich Variety of Things, great and glorious <HI>Things concerning Christ,</HI> are discovered to us in the Gospel of his Grace! <HI>The Kingdom of God</HI> is a comprehensive Article among <HI>those Things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> and sometimes they seem all to be sum'd up in that. But the Apostle here adds a more extensive Phrase, in order to include <HI>all other Things</HI> not so evidently couch'd in the Idea of <HI>the Kingdom of God.</HI> The whole Reve∣lation in sacred Writ, from <HI>Genesis</HI> to the <HI>Apocalypse,</HI> is relative to CHRIST, in some Manner and Degree: But our Text eminently points us to those Things which have
<PB N="20" REF="004510_0022_100D5E59E7EF3888"/>
a more <HI>evident</HI> and <HI>next</HI> Reference to him in the Christian Revelation.</P>
<P>Thus for Instance, the Gospel reveals to us the <HI>Person</HI> of Christ, as <HI>God manifest in the Flesh;</HI> his <HI>Office,</HI> as Me∣diator, under the several Characters of a Prophet, and a Priest, as well as King; the <HI>Covenant of Redemption,</HI> and the Promises made to Him before the World began; the <HI>Predestination</HI> of the <HI>Elect</HI> unto Life in and by him; the <HI>Types</HI> &amp; <HI>Prophecies</HI> of Him in old Time, and their punc∣tual <HI>Accomplishment</HI> in Him; the <HI>History</HI> and <HI>Mystery</HI> of his Incarnation, Conception and Birth, his Life, Miracles and Sufferings, his Death and Resurrection, his Ascension into Glory, and sitting down at the right Hand of the Majesty in the Heavens; so the <HI>Doctrine</HI> he taught, the Laws and Institutes he made, the Promises he gave, whe∣ther in Person, or by his inspir'd Ministers; the Mission of his <HI>Spirit,</HI> as a Teacher, Sanctifier and Comforter, his so∣vereign Agency, and abiding Presence; the Commission and Inspiration of his <HI>Apostles,</HI> the Revelations made to them, and published by them, their Ministry and Preach∣ing, confirm'd with Signs and Wonders; his setting up of the <HI>Gospel-Church,</HI> demolishing the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensa∣tion, and visiting the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to take out of them a Peo∣ple for his Name.—In brief, we have revealed to us the <HI>Example</HI> of Christ; his <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and his <HI>Intercession</HI> in the Merit thereof; the unsearchable Riches of his <HI>Grace,</HI> and the absolute <HI>Sufficiency</HI> of his Power to save; the <HI>Way</HI> of Salvation by him, the <HI>Benefits</HI> we re∣ceive from Him, and the <HI>Duties</HI> we owe to Him; his being the <HI>Head</HI> of his Body, the Church, and Head over all Things to the Church; his being appointed the <HI>Heir</HI> of all Things, and <HI>Judge</HI> of the World; his <HI>second</HI> Ap∣pearing, his <HI>raising</HI> the Dead, and dispensing both Rewards and Punishments everlasting.—This is an incomplete and immethodical Abstract of <HI>those Things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> I pretend not to an exact and perfect Enumeration: much less to a perfect Comprehension of the Meaning of all these Things. But when I meditate them, I soon find my self lost in Wonder, and can't or∣der my Speech by reason of Darkness. <HI>Without Contro∣versy,</HI> GREAT <HI>is the Mystery of Godliness,</HI> the Mystery of
<PB N="21" REF="004510_0023_100D5E5B6DACB408"/>
<HI>Christ,</HI> and his <HI>Kingdom.</HI> Yet all that's necessary to be known by us in our present State, is in the Gospel suffi∣ciently revealed: and as for what transcends our Con∣ception, this however must exercise our Humility, our Faith and Hope, and remain the Subject of our adoring Thoughts.</P>

<P>O what Reason have we to be <HI>thankful</HI> for the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which thus reveals to us <HI>the Kingdom of God, and the Things concerning Christ!</HI>—Well might it be stiled (as it is) the GLORIOUS <HI>Gospel, the</HI> GLAD <HI>Tidings of the Kingdom of God</HI> &amp;c.—Surely the Doctrine of <HI>Christ</HI> our Redeemer, and of <HI>the Things which concern him,</HI> must needs carry much of <HI>Glory</HI> in it, that bespeaks our Wonder and Praise.—The Tidings of a <HI>Kingdom,</HI> the Kingdom <HI>of God,</HI> must be <HI>glad</HI> Tidings indeed; Tidings of <HI>great Joy</HI> to all People.

<P>Which leads me to</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>Ministers of the Gospel are to</HI> preach <HI>the King∣dom of God, and</HI> teach <HI>those Things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Our Text tells us, the Apostle did so; tis remark'd of of him twice in this Chapter, and often elsewhere: and this is recorded <HI>for our Admonition,</HI> upon whom the Ends of the World are come.—Here let it be said briefly,</P>
<P N="1">1. We must preach the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> revealed in the Gospel.</P>
<P>Our Context speaks of <HI>Paul's expounding</HI> and <HI>testifying the Kingdom of God.</HI> And we read (Chap. 19. 9.) of his <HI>daily disputing, and persuading the Things concerning the Kingdom of God.</HI> Even thus Ministers must labour (every one, as of the Ability, which God giveth) to <HI>testify,</HI> and <HI>expound,</HI> also (if need be) to <HI>dispute,</HI> and <HI>persuade</HI> these Things.</P>
<P>We should <HI>testify</HI> the Kingdom of God, asserting its Reality and Existence; and it will be well, if we are able to <HI>witness</HI> unto this from our own happy <HI>Experience.</HI> So we must <HI>expound</HI> it, as we are able, in its whole Extent and Compass; its Nature, its Properties, and Purposes; the Laws and Benefits of it; the Promises concerning it; and the <HI>Truths</HI> relating to it, or inseparably connected with it; particularly the Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin,</HI> that Truth which is so evidently fundamental to the Scheme of Chris∣tianity, and without a due Attention to which we shall be likely to entertain very crude Conceptions of the <HI>King∣dom of God;</HI> also the Doctrine of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> its Ne∣cessity resulting from Original Sin, its Author the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> its Fruits in the christian Life, its essential Con∣nection with eternal Happiness, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> without a just Re∣gard to which important Points, we shall have but very superficial Notions of the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI> Hence, if we
<PB N="24" REF="004510_0026_100D5E6331623A28"/>
wou'd <HI>expound,</HI> as we ought, the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> we should study and preach these great Gospel-Truths.—We must likewise be ready even to <HI>dispute,</HI> as the Apostle did, and <HI>contend earnestly for the Faith,</HI> in regard of <HI>the Things pertaining to the Kingdom of God;</HI> with Meekness and Wisdom instructing such as oppose themselves; labouring to convince Gainsayers, and put them to Silence. We must contend against all the <HI>Enemies</HI> of the Kingdom of God; <HI>wrestle against Flesh and Blood,</HI> and against <HI>spiri∣tual Wickednesses in high Places; resist the Devil and the World,</HI> Vice and Error, in all their various Forms, with the <HI>Sword of the Spirit,</HI> the Word of Truth.—And like the Apostle, we must also <HI>persuade</HI> the Things concerning the Kingdom of God; reasoning with Men out of the Scriptures, to convince them of the Folly of Rebellion, and the Wisdom of Submission to God; exhorting and calling Men to a professed Subjection, and Obedience to the Gos∣pel: as <HI>Paul</HI> shewed to the Gentiles, <HI>that they spou'd repent, and turn to God, and do Works meet for Repen∣tance:</HI> He <HI>testified both to Jews, and Greeks, Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ:</HI> And the Disciples he <HI>persuaded to continue in the Grace of God,</HI> bringing forth the Fruits of the Kingdom, the Fruits of Righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ to the Praise and Glory of God.</P>
<P>In a Word, we must teach <HI>the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghost.</HI> This enters into the Notion of preaching the Kingdom of God. The adorable <HI>Trinity</HI> all concur in the Dispensation of Redemption; acting each his distinct Part in the Affairs of this Kingdom: and so far as Divine Revelation will carry us, we must <HI>testify, expound,</HI> and <HI>persuade</HI> these Things, as <HI>Things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</HI> We must preach the <HI>Father of Mercies</HI> and <HI>God of all Grace:</HI> we must preach the <HI>Spirit of Holiness:</HI> and we must preach the <HI>Lord of Glory.</HI> While we remember the <HI>Creator,</HI> we must never forget the <HI>Redeemer,</HI> and the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:</HI> but display their several Glories, and assert their respective Rights. But this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me to say,</P>
<P N="2">2. We must teach <HI>the Things,</HI> revealed in the Gospel, <HI>concerning our Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST; those Truths espe∣cially
<PB N="25" REF="004510_0027_100D5E64B60E97B0"/>
that have a <HI>near Relation</HI> to Christ, his Person and Mediation. So the Apostle did: he <HI>preach'd Jesus, and the Resurrection.</HI> He <HI>preach'd not himself, but Christ Jesus the Lord.</HI>—He <HI>preached Repentance and Remission of Sins in the Name of Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Though we are not to confine our Preaching wholly to <HI>the Things which</HI> in their direct Aspect <HI>concern the Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> but may and ought to teach many Things that do but <HI>reductively</HI> and <HI>remotely</HI> concern Christ: Yet the special Subject, on which we should often dwell, and very much lay out our Ministry, is <HI>Christ,</HI> and the <HI>Things</HI> more <HI>immediately</HI> concerning Christ. Here must be the Emphasis, the Accent, in our Preaching. We must preach <HI>the Things concerning the Name of Jesus Christ:</HI> his <HI>Person,</HI> Natures and Perfections both Divine and Hu∣man; his <HI>Messiahship,</HI> or mediatorial Character; his <HI>Charge</HI> of a peculiar People, <HI>chosen in him,</HI> and <HI>given him</HI> of the Father, before the World; his <HI>Mission,</HI> and <HI>Incar∣nation</HI> in Time; his <HI>Offices,</HI> and Execution of them; his <HI>States</HI> of Humiliation and Exaltation: the Authority, Excellency, and Usefulness of his <HI>Doctrine</HI> &amp; <HI>Revelation;</HI> the Reasons of his <HI>Obedience</HI> and <HI>Sufferings;</HI> the Ends of his <HI>Resurrection,</HI> and <HI>Ascension;</HI> his <HI>Priestly</HI> Intercession in Heaven, his <HI>Prophetical</HI> Acts, and <HI>Regal</HI> Administra∣tion; his <HI>second Coming</HI> and Kingdom, the <HI>Resurrection</HI> and eternal <HI>Judgment.</HI> In Sum, his <HI>Purchases,</HI> his <HI>Victo∣ries,</HI> and <HI>Triumphs;</HI> the <HI>Benefits</HI> of his Salvation, and Va∣lue of an <HI>Interest</HI> in Him; the Office of his <HI>Spirit</HI> in the Application of Redemption; the Necessity and Efficacy of his <HI>Righteousness,</HI> imputed to us, and received by <HI>Faith,</HI> in the Business of <HI>Justification;</HI> the Necessity and Effi∣cacy also of his <HI>Grace,</HI> in the Conversion of Sinners, and Perseverance of Saints; the Stability of the <HI>Promises</HI> in him; the exceeding Riches of God's <HI>Mercy</HI> in and thro' him; the Greatness and Freeness of his <HI>Love,</HI> the <HI>Ob∣ligations</HI> of Gratitude we are under to him, and the righteous <HI>Claims</HI> he has upon us;—the <HI>Duties</HI> we owe him, and more especially that comprehensive Duty of <HI>believing</HI> in him, <HI>submitting</HI> to his Righteousness, and <HI>depending</HI> on his Grace, <HI>living by the Faith</HI> of the Son of God, and doing whatsoever we do, whether in Word
<PB N="26" REF="004510_0028_100D5E663B5FDC10"/>
or Deed, <HI>in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> in Vir∣tue of his <HI>Grace</HI> in and with us, in Obedience to his <HI>Will,</HI> with a Reliance on his <HI>Merits,</HI> and with an Eye to his <HI>Glory; that the Name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in us, and we in him, according to the Grace of our God, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Let it be subjoined now,</P>
<P N="3">3. We shou'd preach <HI>the Kingdom of God,</HI> and <HI>the Things concerning Christ,</HI> both in <HI>Conjunction,</HI> and in their <HI>Relati∣on</HI> to one another.</P>
<P>The Ideas are somewhat distinct, yet so united, as mu∣tually to involve one the other: and it seems to me, there's no forming any just Notions of <HI>either</HI> Subject, without com∣prising <HI>both.</HI> While we preach the true <HI>Scripture-Doctrine</HI> on the one head, we do indeed implicitly teach the other: But it's abundantly best to be <HI>explicit,</HI> in preaching both together. This is to preach after the Manner of the <HI>Apo∣stles,</HI> and primitive Ministers, as they were taught of God, and led by the Spirit. (See <HI>Acts</HI> 8. 12.—<HI>Chap.</HI> 19. 8, 10. and Context <HI>ver.</HI> 23. with many other Places.) <HI>They</HI> are the proper Standard of Evangelic Preaching<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Gospel indeed <HI>at the first began to be spoken by the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> in his personal Ministry: But the <HI>Confirmation</HI> and <HI>full Declaration</HI> of it was left to his <HI>Spirit,</HI> speaking by the Mouth of the Apostles, &amp; other inspir'd Ministers, after our Lord's Ascension. <HI>Jesus</HI> indeed, when he was risen, abode forty Days on Earth, <HI>speaking</HI> to his Disciples <HI>of the Things pertaining to the</HI> KINGDOM <HI>of God,</HI> &amp; <HI>expounding to them, in all the Scrip∣tures, the Things concerning</HI> HIMSELF: But those Dis∣courses of his, the Holy Ghost hath not been pleas'd to put on Record. And as for his Preaching <HI>in the Days of his Flesh,</HI> it was very much in <HI>Parables,</HI> &amp; evidently with a design'd Reserve, as to the <HI>Peculiars</HI> of Christianity: But these, after his Ascension, were clearly reveal'd by his Spirit to the <HI>Apostles;</HI> &amp; they, with other faithful Men, <HI>fully preach'd the Gospel.</HI> They are therefore the just Pattern, and adequate Rule of our Preaching.—See Mr. <HI>Jennings'</HI>s two excellent Discourses, of <HI>preaching Christ</HI> &amp;c. Edit. N. E. <HI>p.</HI> 26, 29.</NOTE> and it will
<PB N="27" REF="004510_0029_100D5E68484EFFB8"/>
be our Honour, to follow their Example, left on Record for Imitation.—Our Charge is to <HI>preach the Word:</HI> and the Word we preach must be both the <HI>Word of the</HI> KING∣DOM and <HI>the Word of the Lord</HI> JESUS. The Things con∣cerning the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> and those concerning <HI>Christ</HI> are, as in their Nature reciprocally dependant, so in Reve∣lation inseparably connected: And surely <HI>what God hath joined together, Man may not put asunder.</HI></P>
<P>It's Pity a Minister shou'd at any time lay the Plan of his Discourse on <HI>one</HI> of these Subjects, so as to <HI>preclude</HI> the other: and much worse it is, if he ever makes a Sermon without any explicit Regard to <HI>either</HI> of them. This (in plainness of Speech) is to <HI>handle the Word of God deceitful∣ly:</HI> and no Apology can in any measure justify such' Ma∣nagement.—Every suitable Theme of a Pulpit-Discourse is reducible under one or other of these Heads, improvable to serve the Purposes of both, or capable of receiving Illus∣tration and Enforcement from them. Whatever our <HI>Text</HI> is, the Things of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and the Things of <HI>Christ,</HI> may with the utmost Propriety and Pertinence be introdu∣ced, either under the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> or the <HI>Application;</HI> and it will be a most faulty Omission, in any Discourse to pass them wholly in Silence.—The Strain of our Preaching shou'd turn upon <HI>one</HI> or <HI>other</HI> of these Evangelic Subjects: frequently we shou'd consider them <HI>both together,</HI> present∣ing them in one complex View: and when discoursing on <HI>either</HI> of them more <HI>directly,</HI> yet always remember their <HI>Connection</HI> and mutual Dependance, &amp; accordingly consider the one in its <HI>Reference</HI> and <HI>Subserviency</HI> to the other.</P>
<P>In this Method of Preaching we shall be likely to <HI>declare the whole Counsel of God,</HI> and <HI>not keep back any Thing that is profitable,</HI> whether as to the Doctrinals or the Practicals of Revelation.—In this Way we shall lead our Hearers into the most <HI>distinct</HI> and most <HI>consistent</HI> Notions of the Gospel, in the Variety of its rich Contents.—In this Way, we shall <HI>shew our selves approved unto God, Work∣men that need not be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</HI>—And this is the Way <HI>to commend our selves unto every Man's Conscience in the Sight of God,</HI> to suit every one's Relish, and to hit every one's Case, in the Multiplicity we have to do with.—This is the Way to preserve the
<PB N="28" REF="004510_0030_100D5E6B6C0691A0"/>
<HI>christian</HI> Religion in its full and evident <HI>Distinction</HI> from Paganism, Judaism, Mahometism, and every false Re∣ligion. This is the Way to keep the Gospel <HI>distinguish'd</HI> from the Law, Faith from Reason, the Graces of Chri∣stianity from the Morals of Philosophy, and the Professi∣on of Protestants from that of Papists.—In this Way we shall <HI>be able by sound Doctrine both to exhort, and to convince the Gainsayers.</HI> This is the Way to remove the <HI>Offence of the Cross,</HI> and to make <HI>Christ crucified</HI> appear <HI>the Wisdom</HI> and <HI>the Power of God.</HI>—This is the Way to keep Professors <HI>sound in the Faith,</HI>—and at the same time bring them to be <HI>obedient to the Faith.</HI>—In short, This is the Way to advance the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> and to promote the true <HI>Knowledge of God,</HI> and <HI>of Jesus Christ,</HI> which is Life eternal.</P>
<P>On the one hand, <HI>Those Things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> exhibit themselves to us in their strongest, their most beautiful and striking Light, when discoursed in Conjunction with the Things pertaining to the <HI>King∣dom.</HI> When we teach the Things of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> the Things of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> the <HI>Things that be of God,</HI> con∣junctly with the <HI>Things of Christ:</HI> When we preach Christ Jesus the <HI>Lord,</HI> and our <HI>Righteousness;</HI> the <HI>Apostle,</HI> and <HI>High-Priest</HI> of our Profession; <HI>Messiah,</HI> the <HI>Prince;</HI> our <HI>Advocate,</HI> and <HI>Judge;</HI> the Object of our <HI>Trust</HI> and <HI>Hope,</HI> &amp; of our <HI>Fear, Love</HI> &amp; <HI>Obedience:</HI> When we preach both his <HI>Cross,</HI> and his <HI>Crown;</HI> both the <HI>Merits</HI> of his Death, and the <HI>Power</HI> of his Resurrection; both the <HI>Sceptre</HI> of his Grace, and the <HI>Rod</HI> of his Anger; both his <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Example;</HI> both his <HI>Promises</HI> &amp; <HI>Precepts;</HI> both <HI>Remission</HI> of Sins, and <HI>Conversion</HI> thro' his Name; in a Word, both <HI>Repentance</HI> towards God, and <HI>Faith</HI> towards our Lord Jesus Christ: When we thus teach and preach (skilfully harmonizing, tempering and balancing Subjects of such a various Tendency and Aspect) then <HI>the Things which concern Christ</HI> appear in their genuine Light, Ex∣cellency and Importance; carry with them the greatest Force of Attraction, and are most likely to reach their practical Ends and Uses. This is to handle the Matter wisely; and they that <HI>win Souls,</HI> are wise.—But if we confine our Ministry to the sublime Mysteries concern∣ing
<PB N="29" REF="004510_0031_100D5E6DCA7D1EA0"/>
<HI>Christ,</HI> and treat them in a speculative and abstract Manner, exclusively of their practical Inferences, and neg∣lecting the Things pertaining to the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> we preach the Gospel of Grace in a very <HI>imperfect Manner,</HI> and may promise our selves but a very <HI>imperfect Success.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jennings,</HI> ubi supra, <HI>p.</HI> 30, 37.</NOTE>—<HI>This is a faithful Saying, and these Things I will that thou affirm con∣stantly, that they which have believed in God, might be care∣ful to maintain good Works: these Things are good and pro∣fitable unto Men.</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, if ever the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> comes not in <HI>Word</HI> only, but in <HI>Power,</HI> it is when we preach it in Connexion with <HI>the Things that concern the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> When consider'd in one View with these Things, it then appears in its true Glory and Lustre, and is preach'd with the most flaming Light, and successful Energy. If we mean to save our own Souls, or theirs which hear us, we must take Heed to ourselves and to our Doctrine, that we teach and live <HI>the Doctrine of Christ.</HI> We must <HI>keep the Faith,</HI> and <HI>preach</HI> it, pure and entire. Our Mouths must be fill'd with the great Arguments of the <HI>Gospel;</HI> the Principles of the Religion of <HI>Jesus</HI> must reign in our Sermons; else they'll freeze on our Lips, however warm∣ly we may seem to preach the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> in a moral Strain, with a philosophic Turn of Thought. Indeed how can we pretend to be Preachers of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> if we <HI>drop</HI> the Doctrines, and Duties, of a <HI>supernatural</HI> Disco∣very? With what Face can we call our selves <HI>Christian</HI> Ministers, if the <HI>Run</HI> of our preaching is upon the Princi∣ples and Laws of <HI>Nature</HI> (tho' taken into Christianity) while we consider 'em only under their <HI>natural</HI> Form, under the Notion of meer <HI>Morality</HI> or <HI>natural Religion;</HI> forgetting that by their being incorporated into the <HI>Gospel,</HI> they have lost <HI>that</HI> Respect, <HI>chang'd</HI> their <HI>Use</HI> and <HI>End,</HI> put on a <HI>new</HI> Form, and in Effect are turn'd into <HI>Evan∣gelic</HI> Principles and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, so that there's (strictly speak∣ing) nothing at all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>moral,</HI> nothing purely <HI>natural,</HI> in the christian <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or <HI>Canon.</HI>—Sure I am, that to <HI>phi∣losophise</HI> merely, without an Eye to Revelation, or to ha∣rangue upon <HI>natural</HI> Truths and <HI>moral</HI> Duties, in a rational

Way, without reducing them to their proper Place and Use in the <HI>christian</HI> Scheme, and without paying a due Re∣gard to <HI>the Things concerning Christ,</HI> this is not (in the Sense of Scripture) to <HI>preach the Kingdom of God.</HI>—What tho' the <HI>Text</HI> be taken out of the <HI>Bible!</HI> If the Sermon be in 2 philosophical and unevangelic Strain, the Preacher might as well have taken his Text out of <HI>Seneca'</HI>s Morals.—I deny not, <HI>Morality</HI> is to be preach'd: but then it must be <HI>christian</HI> Morality; a Morality springing from <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>Christ,</HI> and animated by Gospel-Principles and Incentives, govern'd by Gospel-Rules, and directed to Gospel-Ends. <HI>Repentance</HI> is to be preach'd, but it must be excited by <HI>looking upon Him whom we have pierced.</HI> And <HI>Obedience</HI> is to be preach'd, but it must be the Obedience of <HI>Faith.</HI> A <HI>good Conversation</HI> is to be recommen∣ded; but it must be a good Conversation <HI>in Christ.</HI>—The <HI>Law</HI> is to be taught: but then it must be the Law as ex∣hibited in <HI>reveal'd</HI> Religion; and so taught, as that it may do the Office of a <HI>Schoolmaster in bringing Sinners to Christ,</HI> and the Part of a <HI>Guide</HI> in conducting <HI>Saints</HI> through the Paths of moral Duty. <HI>The Law is good, if a Man use it lawfully,</HI> and teach it wisely. By the Law is the <HI>Know∣lege of Sin:</HI> it is improvable to awaken <HI>Sinners</HI> by the Terror of the <HI>Curse,</HI> to humble 'em by the Sense of their own <HI>Depravity</HI> and spiritual <HI>Impotence,</HI> to drive 'em out of their <HI>false</HI> Confidences, and compel them to seek an In∣terest in <HI>Christ,</HI> by a Sense of their absolute Need of his <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Grace:</HI> And the <HI>Law</HI> is of Use also to the <HI>Believer,</HI> for the <HI>Direction</HI> of his moral Carriage, for the preserving his <HI>Humility,</HI> and keeping him ever <HI>dependant</HI> upon <HI>Christ.</HI>—With such Views as these, the <HI>Law</HI> is to be taught: and these <HI>Uses</HI> of it are to be kept carefully in our own and our Hearers Eye. Whenever we teach the <HI>Law,</HI> we must still send Men to <HI>Christ,</HI> for <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> for the <HI>Justification of Life,</HI> &amp; for the <HI>Sanc∣tification of the Spirit:</HI> ever guarding our more moral Dis∣courses with proper Cautions against false Ends and false Measures of Obedience, and enforcing all our practical Ex∣hortations by the Principles and Motives of the Gospel.</P>
<P>Why shou'd not <HI>we</HI> introduce the <HI>Things concerning Christ,</HI>

It our <HI>Notions</HI> of Christianity are such as forbid our doing this, or if our <HI>Temper</HI> be such as don't dispose us to it, 'tis justly to be fear'd we are in a <HI>different Scheme,</HI> or else of a <HI>different Spirit,</HI> from that of the Apostles.—Methinks, it looks as if we were <HI>asham'd</HI> of the Gospel, in its peculiar Discoveries, if we are silent on these Heads.

TRUTH. <HI>Every one that is of the</HI> TRUTH, <HI>heareth my Voice.</HI> (John 18. 37.)

<P>If we wou'd approve ourselves as the Ministers of God, it must be (among other Things) <HI>by the Word of Truth.</HI> We must <HI>testify the Gospel of the Grace of God;</HI> the great Truths of the Gospel relating to the Work of Grace in <HI>Redemption;</HI> the Grace of God in the <HI>Purpos<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> the Grace of Christ in the <HI>Pur∣chase,</HI> &amp; the Grace of his Spirit in the <HI>Application</HI> of it. <HI>This is Preaching.</HI> And it carries a Light &amp; Power with it, beyond all philosophical Argument and Persuasive, to promote the Conviction and Conversion of Sinners, and so to promote the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI> If ever we mean to have Sinners conquer'd, and effectually subdued to God, we must bring them the <HI>Testimony of Jesus,</HI> in the Word of Truth; proclaim the <HI>Gospel-Report</HI> concerning Christ &amp; the great Salvation: And if once they come to <HI>receive the Witness of God,</HI> to believe the Truth upon Divine Testimony, and entertain the Gospel, <HI>not as the Word of Man, but as indeed the Word of God,</HI> Then it's like to <HI>Work in them effectually,</HI> to their being <HI>translated out of the Kingdom of Darkness,</HI> into the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI> If God hath from the beginning <HI>chosen them to Salvation,</HI> it is <HI>thro' Sanctification of the Spirit,</HI> and <HI>Belief of the Truth,</HI> whereto He calleth them by the <HI>Gospel,</HI> to the obtaining of the Glory of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI>—When therefore we attempt to <HI>preach the Kingdom of God,</HI> we must never forget <HI>the Sanctificati∣on of the</HI> SPIRIT: But apply to <HI>Him</HI> our selves for his sanctifying Influences to rest on us, and to accompany our Labours for the Good of Souls; and we must send our Hearers to <HI>Him,</HI> teaching them to depend on his <HI>renew∣ing Grace,</HI> and to pray for it; frequently opening the Na∣ture of Conversion, and the Necessity of being <HI>born again,</HI> if they hope to <HI>see the Kingdom of God.</HI>—As the <HI>Belief of the Truth,</HI> in this Point, is of singular Importance, we should endeavour to have them instructed and established well in the Doctrine of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> together with that other it is grounded upon, the Doctrine of <HI>Original Sin.</HI></P>

Let me add, Another most necessary Point to be often insisted on, is the Doctrine of <HI>Justification</HI> by imputed Righteousness, <HI>even the Righteousness of God, without the Law.</HI> Among all <HI>those Things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> and by testifying of which the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> is advanced in the World, this is one very eminent Article, That <HI>Christ is the Lord our Righteousness;</HI> that Christ <HI>is the End of the Law for Righteousness to every one which believeth;</HI> That <HI>as by one Man's Disobedience many were made Sinners, so by the Obedience of One</HI> (the second <HI>Adam) many are made righteous;</HI> that <HI>thro' the Name of Jesus, whosoever believeth in him, receives Remission of Sins, and the Justification of Life.</HI>—This <HI>Truth</HI> is the grand Basis and Support of the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI> Indeed, what is the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> in its <HI>subjective</HI> Notion, but this great <HI>Truth</HI> bro't home to the Soul, powerfully apply'd, and producing its genuine Effects? Hence <HI>the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness,</HI> might well be put in Conjuncti∣on, as the one Object of our <HI>first</HI> Pursuit.—This <HI>Truth</HI> is the main Subject of <HI>the Testimony of Jesus:</HI> to this gave all the <HI>Prophets</HI> and all the <HI>Apostles</HI> Witness.—<Q>This <HI>Truth</HI> is that wherein the Stamp of Divine Authority on Scripture-Revelation is chiefly manifest. All the Parts of Revelation depend on this, and are connected with it; so that, take away this Truth (concerning Christ delivered for our Offences, and raised again for our Justification) take this out of the Gospel, it will be <HI>another</HI> Gospel, and the whole Doctrine of both Testaments will be utterly made of none Effect. This therefore is the great Touchstone for the Trial of true and false Doctrine.—The Name whereby Christ is cal∣led among the Subjects of his Kingdom is that, <HI>The Lord our Righteousness.</HI> That's the Motto of the chri∣stian Church, whereby it's distinguish'd from all other Societies.</Q>—This is peculiarly the <HI>characteristic Truth</HI> of the Gospel, whereby Christianity is conspicuously dif∣ferenc'd from the Religion of Nature, &amp; from all false Re∣ligions.—This <HI>Truth</HI> exhibits the Substance of those an∣cient Types in the Religion of the Jews, and is the Foun∣dation of the Promises made to the Fathers.—This <HI>Truth</HI> (whatever any Enemies of the Cross of Christ may pretend)
<PB N="37" REF="004510_0039_100D5E7FF0CB1E90"/>
does not make void the Law, but establish it: declaring all Righteousness fulfilled by our Surety, and being a pow∣erful Principle of Obedience in the Believer.—This <HI>Truth</HI> signally contributes to illustrate the Wisdom and Grace of God in Redemption, and to display the Grace &amp; Glory of Christ the Redeemer.—This <HI>Truth</HI> is the prime En∣couragement of the Saint's Hope, and affords the first and great Relief to Sinners under the Spirit of Bondage. 'Tis the <HI>Truth,</HI> in this main Point especially, that makes them free.—In a Word, <Q>This <HI>Truth</HI> is the great <HI>Mean,</HI> where∣by God puts forth his Power to save Sinners, and sub∣ject them to Him in his <HI>Kingdom.</HI> It was by the <HI>Re∣velation</HI> of Christ's <HI>Righteousness</HI> in the Gospel, that the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of God our Saviour was at first set up and ad∣vanced in the World: and it was by the <HI>Revival</HI> of this great Truth, after it had been buried under <HI>Anti∣christ'</HI>s Reign, that the Lord began to <HI>consume that wic∣ed one.</HI>—The Strength of <HI>Christ'</HI>s Kingdom, and its Safety, lies in this great Truth: So that they who wou'd advance <HI>his</HI> Kingdom, must bear this <HI>Truth</HI> about with them, in their Hearts, in all their Preaching, and in all their Conversation. And truly this wou'd be a Spring of daily <HI>Refreshment</HI> to themselves, and of great <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Boldness</HI> in all the Labours of the Gospel-Ministry, and in all the Sufferings that attend it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Words of Mr.</HI> Glass, <HI>a Minister lately silenc'd in</HI> Scotland, <HI>for professing Congregational Principles.

<P>Which brings us to our last general Head.</P>
<P>PROP. III. Ministers may well, and ought to, preach and teach these Things <HI>with all Confidence.</HI></P>
<P>The Story of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> acquaints us, that he be∣gan and finish'd his Ministry with a noble Fortitude, speaking <HI>boldly in the Lord,</HI> speaking the Gospel of his God <HI>with much Contention,</HI> and <HI>with all Confidence:</HI> "As one who was himself well assur'd of the <HI>Truth</HI> of wh<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he preach'd, that it was what he durst <HI>stand by,</HI> &amp; of the <HI>Worth</HI> of it, that it was what he durst <HI>suffer for."</HI> He preach'd with Confidence too of <HI>Success,</HI> and of his own <HI>Safety,</HI> and of a future <HI>Reward.</HI>—Herein he is an instructive Example.
<PB N="38" REF="004510_0040_100D5E8179E03D08"/>
And if we have the Spirit of this Apostle, we also shall <HI>preach and teach with all</HI> holy <HI>Confidence.</HI>—I put in this qualifying Word, because there is a Confidence that's <HI>faulty;</HI> the Result of Ignorance and Rashness, and a Sign of Pride and Presumption; highly unbecoming in a <HI>Mini∣ster</HI> above all Men. But still there's a Confidence that is gracious, meek, humble; both an Ornament and Help, and therefore an important Requisite in a Preacher. 'Tis the <HI>Fruit of the Spirit,</HI> the Result of inward vital Experience. Ministers that have <HI>felt</HI> the <HI>Power</HI> of the Gospel on their own Hearts; that have themselves been <HI>experimentally</HI> taught the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> and <HI>the Things of Christ;</HI> such, I say, will have a proportionable <HI>Boldness in the Faith.</HI> They will neither be cold, nor cowardly Preachers: but will usually teach these Things with a holy Confidence, Vigour and Warmth; with a certain <HI>Parrhesia,</HI> Liberty, Skill, and Force; something like the heroic <HI>Paul;</HI> or like <HI>Stephen,</HI> a Man full of Faith, who spake with a <HI>Wisdom and Spirit, that his Adversaries could not withstand.</HI></P>
<P>We shou'd every one make it our Aim, and our Con∣cern, that we may be able, upon the Grounds and Mo∣tives of Experience, to preach the Gospel of <HI>Jesus</HI> with <HI>all Confidence:</HI>—With <HI>Confidence</HI> of the Divine Authori∣ty, Truth and Excellency of the <HI>Christian Revelation;</HI> also with <HI>Confidence</HI> in the <HI>Promise</HI> of Christ's gracious Presence with us, in his <HI>Providence,</HI> to watch over us, and by his <HI>Spirit,</HI> to <HI>assist</HI> and succeed us; and with <HI>Confidence</HI> in his <HI>Righteousness,</HI> to procure our Acceptance and Reward. Verily, if our Hearts condemn us not, we may thus have <HI>Confidence toward God.</HI>—But then there's also a Confi∣dence towards <HI>Men,</HI> which becomes us in our sacred Mi∣nistrations. We must take Heed, that the <HI>Fear of Man</HI> be not a <HI>Snare</HI> to us, and that a false Modesty don't influ∣ence us to betray or conceal the Truths of the Gospel, to <HI>walk in Craftiness,</HI> to do the Work of the Lord <HI>deceitfully,</HI> or in any Regard to fail of making <HI>full Proof</HI> of our Mi∣nistry. We must speak, <HI>not as pleasing Men, but God which trieth our Hearts:</HI> and look that we be <HI>not asham'd of Christ, or of his Words,</HI> however sinful and adulterous a Generation our Lot may be cast among. We must ap∣prove ourselves <HI>good Soldiers of Jesus Christ,</HI> quit our∣selves
<PB N="39" REF="004510_0041_100D5E8373E79900"/>
like <HI>Men,</HI> and be <HI>strong;</HI> strong in the <HI>Grace which is in Christ Jesus;</HI> strong in <HI>Faith;</HI> strong in <HI>Spirit;</HI> boldly exerting our best Powers in the Service of the Gos∣pel; <HI>in nothing asham'd</HI> of it, and <HI>in nothing terrify'd by its Adversaries;</HI> but willing (if God please) even to <HI>resist unto Blood,</HI> above the Fondness of Life, and the Fear of Death. <HI>Let him that speaketh, speak as the Oracles of God;</HI> that is, as they instruct us, and as becomes them, with Gravity, with Humility, and yet <HI>with all Authority,</HI> and <HI>with all Confidence,</HI> with <HI>all Plainness,</HI> and <HI>all Boldness</HI> of Speech; <HI>lifting up our Voice like a Trumpet,</HI> in reproving and exhort∣ing; never asham'd, never afraid.—In a Word, we shou'd preach as Men <HI>alive,</HI> and in <HI>Earnest,</HI> with a bold-spirited <HI>Zeal,</HI> with a Heart warmly engag'd in our Master's Cause, deeply affected with Compassion to Souls, and thorowly concern'd for our own, as knowing that ere long we must give an Account.</P>
<P>All this seems imply'd in the <HI>Confidence,</HI> recommended to us by the Example in our Text. And surely when we consider <HI>whose we are</HI> and <HI>whom we serve,</HI> and <HI>what</HI> it is we preach, and for what <HI>Ends,</HI> this is enough to inspire us with Life and Courage, to inflame our Affections, to animate our Utterance, and make us preach and teach <HI>with all Confidence.</HI>—Alas, while the Teachers of <HI>Error,</HI> &amp; the Teachers of <HI>Sin,</HI> put on a bold Front, and exert them∣selves with Vigour, shall we that are <HI>set for the Defence of the Gospel,</HI> be lukewarm, or pusillanimous!—Have we not seen the happy <HI>Success</HI> of this Apostolic Zeal and Con∣fidence? Have we not sometimes beheld the most ram∣pant Vice, and the <HI>Spirit of Error,</HI> bold as it is, strangely crouch and sneak before the <HI>Word of Jesus,</HI> plainly and powerfully preach'd, with a humble and zealous Confi∣dence?—And if we <HI>hold fast the faithful Word,</HI> and <HI>hold the Beginning of our Confidence stedfast to the End,</HI> shall we not have the <HI>Comfort of Hope,</HI> in Life and in Death, and <HI>Boldness in the Day of Judgment?</HI> Yea, we shall have <HI>Confidence</HI> amidst the Terrors of a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> World, and <HI>not be ashamed before the Son of Man <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Appearing.</HI></P>
<P>What remains now, but some brief Exhortations, a∣greable to the general Scope of this Discourse?</P>

USE 1. Let what has been said, be apply'd by us, to <HI>raise</HI> our Thôts of <HI>the Kingdom of God,</HI> and <HI>the Things con∣cerning Christ,</HI> and to direct us in forming <HI>worthy</HI> Ideas of them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> expected, the Kingdom of the Messiah wou'd be a <HI>Temporal</HI> one: and the <HI>Disciples</HI> themselves were dif∣ficultly bro't to shake off their old Jewish Prejudice; nay, Christians to this Day are apt to entertain too carnal and gross Conceptions of it. But let us remember, Our Lord assures us, that <HI>his Kingdom is not of this World:</HI> and that <HI>it cometh not with Observation; for behold,</HI> says he, <HI>the Kingdom of God is within you.</HI> It is not a Terrene King∣dom; it shines not in worldly Pomp, but in a Celestial Beauty. It's Rise and Progress is not after the manner of earthly Kingdoms, with mighty Noise, Ostentation, and outward Shew: but it has its secret Subsistence in the Soul, makes a silent Entrance, and its Glory is invisible to the bodily Eye.—Indeed, in a Sense it may be said to <HI>come with Observation,</HI> especially in some Cases, when usher'd in by a remarkable Train of preparatory Convictions, when ma∣king an illustrious Progress, and displaying it self in very triumphant spiritual Victories and Successes, drawing At∣tention and exciting Admiration.—In a Sense it may be said to have an <HI>external Shew,</HI> as outward Means, the Word and Ordinances, under the Conduct of the Spirit, are employ'd in the Administration of it; and as the <HI>King∣dom of God,</HI> when it comes with <HI>Power,</HI> always produces observable Effects in the outward Life.—But still it must ever be kept in Mind, that its Seat is in the <HI>hidden</HI> Man, its principal Operations are <HI>unseen,</HI> and its Glory lies all in <HI>Spirituals.</HI>—How great is the Mystery of this Kingdom! How transcendent its Dignity and Benefit! Let us main∣tain high and honourable Conceptions of it. And as those that have a rais'd Opinion of its Worth and Advantages, let us wish its Prosperity, its extensive Spread thro' all the Earth, and its more flourishing State where it is. That must be our daily fervent Petition, <HI>Thy Kingdom come.</HI></P>
<P>And let it be remember'd, that <HI>the Things concerning Christ</HI> are related to this <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and contribute to advance it. The Foundation, the Security, the Genius of this King∣dom, is <HI>Truth,</HI> the Truth as in <HI>Jesus.</HI>—The Doctrine
<PB N="41" REF="004510_0043_100D5E89600B8D60"/>
of <HI>Christ</HI> is a Doctrine <HI>according to Godliness.</HI> Let us value it for its practical Tendency, as well as Divine Sublimity. Let us <HI>search for Knowledge</HI> in this, <HI>as for hid Treasures.</HI> Let our own and others Ignorance and Slight of these Things be the Matter of our mournful Regret: and let it be for a Lamentation, that there is in general no greater Appearance of the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> and of a Regard to the <HI>Things of Christ,</HI> prevailing among us. But what <HI>Tokens for Good</HI> may be seen at this Day, in some hopeful Begin∣nings among our selves, and the Tidings of Joy we have from other Parts, both in <HI>Europe</HI> &amp; <HI>America,</HI> these chal∣lenge our thankful Notice.</P>
<P>USE 2. Let what has been said, be apply'd by way of Incentive and Direction in the great Duty of <HI>Self-Exami∣nation.</HI></P>
<P>What will it profit, my Brethren, to have <HI>the Kingdom of God, and the Things that concern Christ,</HI> preach'd to us, unless, we have experienc'd indeed the inward and vital Dispensation hereof by the Spirit of Grace! Let us be willing then to <HI>come to the Light,</HI> and bring our selves to the Test.</P>
<P>Have we ever had a thorow Conviction of our <HI>miserable</HI> State by <HI>Nature?</HI> Been made to see and bewail our Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> and to <HI>know the Plague of our own Heart?</HI> To see our selves under the <HI>Power of Satan</HI> and the Rule of Sin, <HI>hateful</HI> to God, and under the <HI>Curse</HI> of his Law? To see the absolute Necessity of a <HI>Change</HI> of our State? To see our utter <HI>Impotence</HI> to deliver our own Souls, and our utter <HI>Unworthiness</HI> of Divine Relief?—And has this View of our wretched Case had its genuine Influence, to <HI>humble</HI> our Pride, and bring us to <HI>abhor</HI> ourselves?—Have we <HI>beheld the Majesty of God,</HI> and been <HI>persuaded by the Terrors of the Lord,</HI> to throw our selves at the Foot of sovereign Mercy?—Have we <HI>as in a Glass beheld the Glory of</HI> Christ, <HI>heard his Voice and seen his Shape at any Time?</HI> Have we heard Him speaking to our <HI>inner Man,</HI> searching the Secrets of it, and instructing our very Reins? While the external Word has been sounding in our Ears, has there been an <HI>inward</HI> Word spoken to our <HI>Hearts,</HI> making them even <HI>burn</HI> within us?—Has the <HI>Spirit,</HI> whose Office it is to glorify the Son, <HI>taken of the Things of Christ,</HI> and <HI>shewn

them to us?</HI>—Are we <HI>of the Truth,</HI> on the Side &amp; under the Power of Truth, <HI>the Truth which came by Jesus Christ?</HI>—Have we felt <HI>the Love of Christ constraining us,</HI> to submit ourselves to his <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and his <HI>Yoke;</HI> to receive Him in all his Offices, and for all his Benefits; to prize Commu∣nion with Him; to love his Image, wherever we see it; to follow his Example, obey his Will, and seek his Glory; and long to <HI>dwell in our Master's Joy,</HI> free from all <HI>Sin,</HI> as well as Sorrow, and perfect in <HI>Holiness</HI> for ever?</P>
<P>Let Conscience give a faithful Answer to these Questions. Let us expostulate with our selves in solemn manner; at the same time depending on, and imploring the Aids of the blessed <HI>Comforter:</HI> and let us employ our utmost Cau∣tion, that we ben't deluded, by groundless Presumptions, into a false Peace in this World, and eternal Perdition in the next. O what an awful Thing will it be for us, when we've been flattering ourselves with Dreams of the <HI>King∣dom of God,</HI> to find our selves at last in the <HI>Kingdom of Darkness!</HI> to sink from the Views and Hopes of <HI>Heaven,</HI> into the Horror and Despair of Hell! Amazing will be the Disappointment: and ten fold, yea ten thousand fold the Torment!—If a Man thinketh himself <HI>Something,</HI> while he is <HI>Nothing,</HI> he <HI>deceiveth himself.</HI> The grossest Folly!—O let us take Care that we ben't found amongst those <HI>Fools in Israel.</HI></P>
<P>USE 3. Let <HI>Ministers</HI> be reminded of the <HI>Lessons of Duty</HI> taught them by the Example in our Text.</P>
<P>We also are sent to <HI>preach the Kingdom of God</HI> and the <HI>Things concerning Christ.</HI>—These were the exalted Themes of the inspir'd <HI>Apostle'</HI>s Ministry.—These are Things which <HI>the Angels desire to look into.</HI> The <HI>Psalmist,</HI> when in the Spirit mu∣sing upon them, tho't his Heart was <HI>inditing good Matter,</HI> &amp; when he spake of the Things which he had made <HI>touching the King,</HI> his Tongue was <HI>as the Pen of a ready Writer.</HI> Surely these are Things every way worthy to be study'd and preach'd.—Such Preaching is eminently suited to the Gospel-Dispensation, its Spirit and Design, and to the End of our Ministry, the Glory of Christ, in the Conversion and Edification of Souls; peculiarly adapted to the Wants of Sinners, and to the Gust of Saints.—Let us therefore, my Fathers and Brethren, be careful to lay out our Labours
<PB N="43" REF="004510_0045_100D5E8DA496BAD0"/>
in the Word and Doctrine, on these great and important Subjects. Let none have Occasion to complain, that <HI>of the Matter of the Kingdom we told 'em not,</HI> or that we <HI>ceased to preach and teach Jesus Christ.</HI>—Sad it is, if any of us have been wanting here, or if we need to have <HI>the Way of the Lord expounded</HI> even to our selves <HI>more perfectly.</HI> O let us <HI>meditate on these Things,</HI> and <HI>give our selves wholly to them, that our profiting may appear unto all.</HI>—Let them fill our Sermons; and not merely be drag'd in, to make a sort of eccentric and glimmering Appearance now and then. We shou'd take the Gospel for our <HI>Vade Mecum. Let the Dead bury their Dead: but go thou, and preach the Kingdom of God. Go forth in the Strength of the Lord, and make Mention of his Righteousness, even of his only.</HI>—These Things let us preach and teach <HI>with all Confidence;</HI> with all humble Confidence internal towards <HI>God,</HI> and external towards <HI>Men.</HI> We have the Example of the <HI>Apostle,</HI> to countenance and quicken us.</P>
<P>And I can't forbear observing here, We have in a fresh Instance seen this <HI>Pauline</HI> Spirit and Doctrine remarkably exemplify'd among us. We have seen <HI>a Preacher of Righ∣teousness, fervent in Spirit, teaching diligently the Things of the Lord, ceasing not</HI> even <HI>daily to preach the Kingdom of God,</HI> and <HI>the Things concerning Christ;</HI> and this <HI>with all Confidence.</HI> May I not say, that the <HI>Gospel</HI> he preach'd <HI>came not unto us in Word only, but in Power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much Assurance? For your selves, Bre∣thren, know his Entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain!</HI>—And as for <HI>us,</HI> we have been surpriz'd—We have been pleas'd—And shall we not now strive to imitate!—<HI>As every Man hath received the Gift, so let him minister the same.</HI> And as we've been <HI>put in Remembrance,</HI> let us <HI>stir up the Gift of God in us.</HI>—Brethren, pray for us.</P>
<P>USE 4. Let what has been said, recommend to all of you, the <HI>diligent Study</HI> and <HI>delightful Contemplation</HI> of these Things.—Surely, the Matter of our Preaching is worthy to be the Matter of your Meditation. I might enforce this Duty by a Variety of Considerations.—And I had tho't here to direct the Exhortation to our <HI>Candidates</HI> for the Pulpit. As you wou'd be <HI>Fellow-Helpers</HI> with us, Re∣solve
<PB N="44" REF="004510_0046_100D5E8F2A63E5F0"/>
that thro' Grace you will be the <HI>Students</HI> and the <HI>Preachers</HI> of CHRIST, his <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and his <HI>Righteousness.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the venerable aged Mr.</HI> Wm. Williams'<HI>s excel∣ent Sermon on</HI> Col. 4. 11. (<HI>at</HI> Anniv. Conven. Min.) p. 20.</NOTE> But I forbear.</P>
<P>USE 5. Let the <HI>Children of the Kingdom</HI> endeavour to strengthen the Hands of the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Kingdom; doing nothing to abate our holy <HI>Confidence,</HI> or to <HI>hinder the Gospel,</HI> but <HI>helping together</HI> by your Prayers, your Coun∣sels, and Examples. Let us see you both exemplarily at∣tending and profiting by our Labours. So shall we <HI>thank God, and take Courage.</HI>—Be ye also bold in your Profes∣sion, and resolute in your Practice of Christianity, <HI>adorn∣ing the Doctrine of God your Saviour in all Things.</HI>—<HI>Re∣joice in Christ Jesus, and have no Confidence in the Flesh.</HI> Rejoice and fear not, <HI>because it's your Father's good Plea∣sure to give you the Kingdom.</HI> Adore electing Love, re∣deeming Mercy, and renewing Grace: And <HI>walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his Kingdom and Glory.</HI> Remember, it is a Kingdom of Holiness; and live under its Restraints, live by its Rules. Mourn your Defects. <HI>Grow in Grace and in the Knowledge of Christ.</HI> Pity and pray for Christless graceless Sinners. Be con∣cerned in particular for those under your Family-Charge, that the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> may be formed in their Souls, that <HI>Christ</HI> may <HI>dwell in their Hearts by Faith;</HI> that your dear Lord may be known and honoured in your Fami∣lies.—I leave with you that excellent Portion of Scrip∣ture, for the Exercise of your retir'd Tho'ts, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.</P>
<P>And now in the last Place,</P>
<P>USE 6. Let me exhort such among you as are yet in your Sins, <HI>to give an earnest Heed to the Things which you have heard.</HI></P>
<P>I hope, none of you will act as if I had been merely amusing you with a tedious Discourse on insignificant Im∣pertinences, and treat it accordingly with Coldness &amp; Neg∣lect. Surely, the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> and <HI>the Things concern∣ing Christ,</HI> are not Matters of empty Speculation, to be
<PB N="45" REF="004510_0047_100D5E92F2680998"/>
made a Jest of, nor Matters of Indifference, to be trifled with. No, assure your selves, they are Things of the highest practical Concern, and of infinite Moment, in which your Souls and your everlasting Interests are deeply involv'd. Let none of you then be careless forgetful Hear∣ers. Apply what has been said, to excite in you a just Solicitude, that you may be found obeying that Call of our Saviour, Matth. 6. 33. <HI>Seek first the</HI> KINGDOM <HI>of God and his</HI> RIGHTEOUSNESS.—Understand the Expres∣sions as equivalent to those in our <HI>Text.</HI></P>
<P>It's the <HI>Kingdom of God, which is within Men,</HI> and the <HI>Righteousness of God, which is by Faith of Jesus Christ,</HI> that is the proper Object of the Sinners <HI>first</HI> Pursuit. These are Blessings of the first Importance; they demand your first Thought and Care, and must be obtain'd, as ever you hope for future eternal Happiness. If you are not <HI>in Christ,</HI> and have not him <HI>of God made unto you Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption,</HI> you are un∣done for ever. The <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> must be set up in your Souls, by the Operation of <HI>regenerating</HI> Grace; or you have no possible <HI>Meetness</HI> for the heavenly Inheritance. And the <HI>Righteousness of God</HI> our Saviour, that <HI>everlasting Righ∣teousness,</HI> which he bro't in by his <HI>Obedience unto the Death,</HI> must be <HI>upon</HI> you, unto the <HI>Justification of Life,</HI> through Faith in Christ; or you have no possible <HI>Title</HI> to Heaven and Blessedness, but must <HI>die in your Sins,</HI> and be herded among unpardon'd Devils for ever.—Think not to spin a Righ∣teousness for your selves, by any Works that you can do: It will prove but a Spider's Webb, and not <HI>hide the Shame of your Nakedness.</HI> If you are <HI>Enemies of the Cross of</HI> CHRIST, your <HI>End</HI> will be <HI>Destruction.</HI> Take Warn∣ing from that of Christ to the self-righteous <HI>Pharisees,</HI>—Verily I say unto you, <HI>Publicans and Harlots enter into the Kingdom of God before you.</HI> And, again, <HI>Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God, as a little Child, shall in no wise enter therein.</HI> You must be humbled, and bro't to lie abas'd at the foot of sovereign Grace, to <HI>submit to the Righteousness of God;</HI> or you can∣not <HI>receive the Kingdom of God:</HI> and if you don't receive the Kingdom of God in this World, the Kingdom of Hell must inevitably be your Portion in the next.—But if you
<PB N="46" REF="004510_0048_100D312C40CABA70"/>
receive the <HI>Kingdom of God and his Righteousness,</HI> this will secure to you compleat and eternal Blessedness. How wor∣thy then are these of your first Concern, and most earnest Pursuit!—O that we cou'd see in our Day the fulfilling of that Scripture, <HI>The Kingdom of God is preached, and every Man presseth into it!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>On the preceeding Lecture we were entertain'd (by Mr.</HI> Cooper) <HI>with a very seasonable and excellent Sermon from</HI> those Words: <HI>which occasion'd my being so brief in this last Exhortation. Otherwise I shou'd have left Room for the proper Enlargements here, and have gone into various distinct Addresses.</HI></NOTE> Hear, all ye Inhabitants of <HI>Zion,</HI> Young and Old, High and Low, Rich and Poor to∣gether! O let all agree in making this your prime Care, Aim, and Desire, That you may receive the <HI>Kingdom of God and his Righteousness.</HI>—Mind the <HI>Things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> and <HI>seek Righteous∣ness;</HI> yet not as <HI>Israel</HI> sought it, <HI>as it were by the Works of the Law.</HI> But <HI>knowing that a Man is not justified by the Deeds of the Law, but by the Faith of Jesus Christ,</HI> be concern'd that you may have it <HI>given you to believe, with the Heart to believe unto Righteousness; that being justified by Grace, you may be Heirs according to the Hope of eternal Life.</HI>—But take Heed, lest <HI>while ye seek to be justified by Christ, ye yourselves be found Sinners,</HI> unrenewed, &amp; vain Pretenders to the Faith of Christ. Remember, <HI>the King∣dom of God</HI> and <HI>his Righteousness</HI> are join'd in the Gospel, and dispensed in Connexion. You have both, or you have neither. Make them therefore the joint-Object of your first Pursuit. Be equally sollicitous for Pardon and Conversion, for the <HI>sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus,</HI> and for the <HI>Washing of Regeneration.</HI>—Be <HI>waiting at the Posts of Wisdom's Doors,</HI> attending the Means of Grace, <HI>in Season, out of Season,</HI> with earnest unceasing Prayer, that you may <HI>win Christ,</HI> and be <HI>found in him;</HI> that the <HI>Kingdom of God</HI> may be implanted within you, and his <HI>Righteousness</HI> apply'd to you.—Let such as are at <HI>at Ease in Zion,</HI> awake out of their Security, lest the Doom be passed upon them, <HI>He
<PB N="47" REF="004510_0049_100D5E94CBCC4B50"/>
that is filthy, let him be filthy still.</HI>—And let such as are under Convictions, be <HI>looking diligently lest they fail of the Grace of God,</HI> and lest they be <HI>of them which draw back unto Perdition.</HI>—And let us all that have received the <HI>Kingdom of God,</HI> in the reveal'd Model and outward Dis∣pensation, and have receiv'd <HI>his Righteousness</HI> in external Profession, attend to that solemn Exhortation of the Apo∣stle, with which I conclude, Heb. 12. 28, 29. <HI>Wherefore we receiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have Grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with Reve∣rence and godly Fear. For our God is a consuming Fire.</HI></P>
