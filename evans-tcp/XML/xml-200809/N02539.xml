<HEAD>The Holy Walk AND Glorious Translation OF Blessed <HI>Enoch.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>GENESIS V. 24.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SINGULAR in the <HI>Old World</HI> was the <HI>Per∣son</HI> and the <HI>Thing</HI> here spoken of; the holy <HI>Life</HI> and the happy <HI>End</HI> of blessed <HI>Enoch.</HI> He was the most remarkable and distinguished among the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> before the Flood; for his eminent Godliness &amp; excelling Piety; for his short and fervent Life, and God's taking him to Heaven without seeing Death. He was a Man of God, a zealous Prophet of the Lord, and preach'd earnestly to the sinners in his day of the Coming of Christ to Judg∣ment <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Jude v.</HI> 14, 15.</NOTE>. And God rewarded his excelling saith, sanctity &amp; labours, with a distinguishing <HI>Exit,</HI> or departure hence.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003011_0004_0FEF9EDA8A68F678"/>
MY <HI>Text</HI> speaks <HI>three</HI> things of him, That he <HI>walked with GOD,</HI> that he <HI>was not,</HI> that <HI>God took him.</HI> It is a short Record of three very great and copious things; of his heavenly life on earth and of his glorious removal to a bet∣ter World.</P>
<P>THAT he <HI>was not</HI> means not that <HI>he died;</HI> but the contrary, that he <HI>died not.</HI> The Apostle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> tells us how God took him, Heb. 11.5. <HI>By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death, and was not found because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God.</HI> Walking with God is the thing that <HI>pleases</HI> him. This is the fruit and evidence of the <HI>Faith</HI> of God's Elect. They that <HI>walk</HI> with God in this world, he will in a little while <HI>take</HI> to himself in a better life.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Enochs</HI> walk with God was in such a singular manner, and was so singularly pleasing to Him, that God distinguished him from the rest of Mortals, and the <HI>Angels</HI> of God took him up in the body, as they did <HI>Elias</HI> afterward, and as they do the Souls of other Believers now, and carried him to the Presence and Pa∣radise of God.</P>
<P>THIS must be resolved into the Good plea∣sure of God, his wise and Sovereign will; and to be sure it was not for any Merit or desert in <HI>Enochs</HI> holy walking with God. <HI>Enoch</HI> de∣serv'd to have died for his Sins, as well as any before or after him. He was born in sin as well as other Sons of <HI>Adam,</HI> and cou'd never say I am pure from sin till his glorious Change
<PB N="3" REF="003011_0005_0FEF9EDC45FD0520"/>pass'd on him, as he was caught up. <HI>Elias</HI> was a Man of like <HI>passions</HI> with others, and ask'd to <HI>die;</HI> yet he was translated as well as <HI>Enoch.</HI> It was not due to the Righteousness of either that they were taken without seeing Death. Before that God formed them in the belly, he design'd them their <HI>Translation.</HI></P>
<P>Never the less God doubtless meant hereby to put eminent honour on singular Piety, and to excite others to labour after Eminence there∣in. So God crowns his own Work, his own Gift. <HI>The Lord is well pleased in his own Righte∣ousness</HI> in his Saints, and for his own Names sake magnifies and honours it. Singular Zeal, Diligence and Devotion in degenerate times shall receive a distinguishing Reward. As <HI>Elias</HI> was <HI>alone</HI> in the cause of God in a most corrupt time, so in <HI>Enochs</HI> day the flood of In∣fidelity &amp; Impiety begun to break in upon the old World.</P>
<P>THEN God saw it a fit time to give Mankind an <HI>Ocular</HI> Testimony of that Eternal Life which he has prepared for them that love and please him. <HI>Adam</HI> was but just dead, as it were, be∣fore the Translation of <HI>Enoch;</HI> and some think that <HI>Adam</HI> himself was the first Instance of a <HI>natural</HI> death; (for as to <HI>Abel</HI> he died a <HI>violent</HI> one) and the World by reason of the rarity of Death and the long life of Mankind might grow into a strange degree of unbelief, profaness, sensuality &amp; injustice before the death of <HI>Adam.</HI> Now I take <HI>Enochs</HI> translation to have been meant and order'd by God as a Testimony to the very Senses and common Understanding of
<PB N="4" REF="003011_0006_0FEF9EE324072118"/>the Men of the <HI>Old World, First,</HI> that there is a blessed <HI>Immortality</HI> for pious and holy Persons in an unseen and eternal World; <HI>Secondly,</HI> that they shall live and be blessed there both in <HI>body and soul</HI> united; and consequently <HI>Thirdly,</HI> that there shall certainly be a <HI>Resur∣rection</HI> of the Bodies of <HI>Saints</HI> to a blessed Life and glorious Immortality.</P>
<P>NOT that I think the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> before <HI>Enoch</HI> were without the Doctrine and Hope of the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of the body: I believe much the contrary, namely, that God revealed this to <HI>Adam,</HI> and that <HI>Enoch</HI> had walked in <HI>this</HI> Faith, Others before him, But the World, now a thousand year <HI>old</HI> in sin, began to languish un∣der a miserable decay of <HI>Faith,</HI> and needed some remarkable <HI>Testimony</HI> from Heaven to the Doctrine of a future Life and the Resurrection of the Body.</P>
<P>AND as to <HI>Enoch's</HI> being taken <HI>so soon</HI> from his holy walk on earth to the heavenly World; for he lived not <HI>half</HI> the days of <HI>Adam,</HI> or his other gracious <HI>Progenitors,</HI> I might suggest,</P>
<P>THAT God hereby testified his <HI>delight</HI> in <HI>early</HI> Piety, diligence and proficiency; That he poured <HI>contempt</HI> upon <HI>long</HI> life on earth, in comparison of the Eternal Glory; That he let the other <HI>Patriarchs</HI> and holy Men see that eight or nine hundred years here was not the <HI>right,</HI> the privilege not reward of their emi∣nent Piety; and that they should by no means <HI>depend</HI> on it or <HI>take up</HI> with it. In a word, <HI>Enochs</HI> translation was the more like to be taken notice of in the Age that then was, by
<PB N="5" REF="003011_0007_0FEF9EE06F56BA88"/>his being translated <HI>young.</HI> If he had liv'd his nine hundred years it is likely the thing had been less observed and talked of and laid to heart.</P>
<P>SOME <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. <HI>Boys</HI> of <HI>Dublin.</HI></NOTE> have observed that as <HI>Enoch</HI> was the <HI>seventh</HI> from <HI>Adam,</HI> so <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>five</HI> more were subjected to natural death, but He the seventh was translated, to point out to us the <HI>Time</HI> when the blessed Resurrection of the Just might be expected: Soil. That as Death should reign over the race of <HI>Adam</HI> for <HI>six thou∣sand</HI> years, so the <HI>seventh</HI> would restore all the <HI>spiritual seed</HI> of the <HI>second Adam</HI> to a state of glorious Immortality.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> observes, That <HI>Enoch</HI> liv'd just a <HI>Year of years,</HI> which as Men liv'd then was to go in the <HI>midst</HI> of his days; for the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> before the Flood did more than <HI>double</HI> that Age; and God took them so soon because the World was grown corrupt and was unworthy of him; or because he was so much above the World and weary of it, and desirous of a speedy removal out of it: Or because his Work was done, and done the sooner for his minding it so closely. God often takes them soonest whom he loves best, and the time they lose on earth is gained in heaven, to their unspeakable advantage.</P>
<P>I have held you too long it may be on the <HI>Person</HI> and <HI>Thing</HI> in the <HI>Text,</HI> the Patriarch <HI>Enoch</HI> and his glorious <HI>Translation.</HI> The plain <HI>Doctrinal Observation</HI> I shall now speak to is this,</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003011_0008_0FEF9EE5F161A9A0"/>
DOCT. <HI>THAT God will undoubtedly take those to Himself in another and better World, that walk with Him in this World.</HI> As he did by <HI>Enoch</HI> who prophesied of the Coming of CHRIST in the great Day, so he will by all others that look and wait for his Appearing. In <HI>Enochs</HI> character and reward, all Men may learn their duty, and Saints their property &amp; priviledge.</P>
<P><HI>HE walked with God:</HI> He set God always be∣fore him; kept his eye continually upon God, and consider'd himself always under the eye of God; observ'd by him and accountable to him. He was a follower and imitator of the blessed God, studied his glorious Nature &amp; Perfecti∣ons and his holy Will, and conform'd his heart and life to both, as far as he could attain. He made it his constant care and business to <HI>please</HI> God, for can two <HI>walk</HI> together except they are agreed? He was wholly devoted to the Service of God, and the Felicity he proposed to himself was Communion with God here and the Enjoyment of him for ever. He did not walk after the course of this world, with the men of that wicked age; No, but contrary to them; his fellowship was with the <HI>Sons of God,</HI> in whom was all his delight, and among whom he shone a burning light. He preach'd against the wickedness that then began to prevail over the earth with great zeal and courage, and warn'd them of the <HI>Day</HI> when God wou'd judge 'em for their <HI>ungodly deeds.</HI> Thus he <HI>walked</HI> with God, exercising himself unto Godliness, and making Religion the business and joy of
<PB N="7" REF="003011_0009_0FEF9EE8738F0150"/>his life, God's glory his ruling End, and his own Salvation his great and chief care.</P>
<P>IN all this <HI>we</HI> must take him for our <HI>Exam∣ple,</HI> to walk even as he walked; in the same <HI>Spirit</HI> and in the same <HI>Stops.</HI> — We must walk by <HI>Faith</HI> as <HI>Enoch</HI> did, by which the Just do live, and without which it is impossible to please God. So <HI>Abraham</HI> walked <HI>before</HI> God and was perfect, and so <HI>Moses</HI> walked as see∣ing him that is Invisible, and having respect to the Recompence of Reward. —</P>
<P>BY <HI>Repentance</HI> we must return to God, and walk humbly with him, the wicked and impe∣nitent are walking contrary to God, and he walks <HI>contrary</HI> to them. But how did the <HI>Son of God</HI> on earth seek out humble <HI>Penitents,</HI> walk and converse with them, and joy in them?—To walk as <HI>Christ</HI> walked is indeed to walk with God. He always did those things that pleased the <HI>Father,</HI> whose Soul was ever highly pleased in him. He has given us an Example that we should follow his steps. —We must walk with God in the daily and continual du∣ties of <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Praise,</HI> in all stated and oc∣casional Exercises of religious <HI>Worship,</HI> solitary and social, private and publick. We must walk with God in our <HI>Closets,</HI> with our <HI>Fami∣lies,</HI> and in <HI>God's</HI> house, in all his <HI>Ordi∣nances,</HI> blameless. — To walk with God means, in <HI>all</HI> the parts and instances of a sober, righteous and godly Life; and constancy therein all our days. We walk with God in a sincere, universal and persevering <HI>Obedi∣ence</HI> to the written Word and revealed Law of
<PB N="8" REF="003011_0010_0FEF9EEC896EE6D8"/>God: And <HI>blessed are the undefiled in the way that walk in the Law of the Lord.</HI> We walk with God in a reverential <HI>Submission</HI> to him in all his Providences. Then God is with us and says to us, <HI>When thou passest thro</HI> <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The Office &amp; Work of the Holy Spirit <HI>from p. 237.</HI></NOTE> <HI>the Waters I am with thee.</HI> It is good having God with us when our way is cloudy and dark, and in the night of afflictions, going before us, holding us up, leading us on, and keeping us safe. When the three <HI>Worthies</HI> were thrown into the flam∣ing furnace the Son of God came down and walked there with them. — Indeed to walk with God is a Phrase that speaks <HI>Eminence</HI> in Religion; but it especially &amp; strongly implies <HI>Progress,</HI> proficiency and perseverance in every thing that is holy just and good. To <HI>walk</HI> is not to take a <HI>step</HI> or too, nor is it for a <HI>day</HI> or a year, but for the whole life, <HI>all</HI> our days. We must walk and work while the day lasts; the light is given for this. The way is but short, a few steps up-hill, in a strait &amp; narrow path, that leads to eternal life. We read of <HI>Walking in the Spirit,</HI> Gal. 5.25. That is to walk with God: <Q>A <HI>Spiritual</HI> life; the most excellent and <HI>noble</HI> kind of life, under the continual vital Influence of the <HI>Holy Spirit?</HI></Q> This <HI>walking</HI> (says the Rev. Mr. <HI>How</HI> on that <HI>Text</HI>) doth more directly and formally denote a <HI>self-motion,</HI> a <HI>voluntary</HI> motion, an <HI>orderly</HI> mo∣tion, a <HI>pleasurable</HI> motion, a <HI>continued</HI> and <HI>pro∣gressive</HI> motion. This can only be in the <HI>light</HI> of the Spirit, and in his <HI>power.</HI> Hence in the progress in <HI>Spirituality</HI> Thus How.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003011_0011_0FEF9EF1170DE6B8"/>
AND now let us consider, What an <HI>honnara∣ble</HI> thing this is, to walk with God! What an honour should we account it, if our earthly <HI>Prince</HI> would allow us to walk after him in his Garden? Only a few select and favourite <HI>Nobles</HI> have the honour done them. What the is <HI>Man,</HI> that God magnifies him in speak∣ing of <HI>his</HI> walking with <HI>the King Eternal, Immor∣tal, Invisible!</HI> Will God in very deed walk with <HI>us</HI> on earth? Behold Heaven, and the Heaven of heavens cannot contain him?</P>
<P>How <HI>peasant</HI> must this be, to walk with GOD? Such was <HI>Eden,</HI> the Garden of God, in man's first stare; and such is the <HI>Paradise</HI> of God above. Such are all the ways of Wis∣dom and Holiness, <HI>ways of pleasantness &amp; paths of peace.</HI></P>
<P>How <HI>safe</HI> and secure must they be that walk with God? guarded by his Power, cover'd with his Wing, protected by his Providence, and desended by his Angels: As <HI>Jacob</HI> on his way when God's <HI>Hosts</HI> met him. O the Secu∣rity and Serenity of this way! living &amp; dying such are safe.</P>
<P>YEA everlastingly happy and <HI>blessed</HI> are all such in the World to come. They are going to God, to be with him, and blessed in him, for ever and ever: Going where <HI>Enoch</HI> is, and to be as <HI>be</HI> is: Not indeed as he went, without dying, but it is all one in the end, at the Re∣surrection: <HI>Gohriel,</HI> and <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Moses</HI> &amp; <HI>Elias</HI> there walk together. In the presence of CHRIST; and are one in Line, Glory and Blessedness.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003011_0012_0FEF9EF306D83280"/>
BUT this leads me into the <HI>Proof</HI> of the Doctrine, That if we do walk with God here in this life, <HI>he will take as to himself for ever.</HI> As truly as he took <HI>Enoch,</HI> so will he all them that walk in <HI>Enoch</HI>'s faith and piety. It will be shortly said of every one of them, <HI>He is not, for God took him.</HI> Took him! whither? why where he took <HI>Enoch,</HI> up to himself in heaven. As truly as <HI>Enoch</HI> is there, you shall be shortly there also if you walk with God.</P>
<P>To state this easy <HI>Truth</HI> it must be said,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>NOT bodily</HI> and alive to heaven, without seeing and tasting death, as <HI>Enoch</HI> was taken. No such matter; and it matters not much. The Godly die as well as others. <HI>Two</HI> only of the Saints have been translated, one before the Flood, and one under the Law; and for Gospel days the Resurrection and Ascension of our <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> may abundantly suffice, to strengthen and uphold the faith of Saints. That glorious <HI>Son of man</HI> became obe∣dient to death for the sake of his Elect, to teach them to expect a dissolution, and how to pass comfortably as well as holily thro' it, hav∣ing the sting of it taken away by his dying. He died not to purchase for them a Translation; no, but a Resurrection. Every Saint may take up <HI>Jobs</HI> words, and say to God with holy Sub∣mission; Job. 30 23. <HI>For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, the house appointed for all the living.</HI> But altho' no Saint looks to be taken bodily to heaven, as <HI>Enoch</HI> was without seeing death, yet</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="003011_0013_0FEF9EF751E9A5C8"/>
2. GOD takes the <HI>Souls</HI> of them to himself at death, who have walked with him in this life. The <HI>Soul</HI> is the Person; if that be taken up to God it matters not tho' the body be laid for a time in the earth, Eccl. 12.7. <HI>The body returns to the earth as it was, but the spirit returns to God that gave it.</HI> The <HI>Spirits of the just made perfect</HI> are in the same Heaven, the same Para∣dise, where <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> are in their Spiri∣tual bodies. Thither the Angels carried the Soul of the gracious beggar, <HI>Lazarus,</HI> when he died at the rich man's <HI>gate:</HI> And thither they carried the happy Spirit of the penitent <HI>thief,</HI> when it left the body upon a <HI>cross;</HI> And thither the holy Soul of <HI>Christ</HI> went for the three days that he left his body in the <HI>grave:</HI> To his <HI>Fa∣ther</HI> he said, <HI>Intothy hand I commit my Spirit.</HI>— So God took <HI>Moses</HI> &amp; <HI>Aaron</HI> from the Mount in the day they were uncloath'd and buried; and so <HI>Jesus</HI> took the Soul of <HI>Stephen</HI> while the bruised flesh fell under the cruel stones. De∣vour men took up the precious remains &amp; bu∣ried them, with great lamentation.</P>
<P>GOD as truly takes the <HI>Soul</HI> by dying and at death, as he took <HI>Enoch</HI> without seeing death. If the <HI>Soul</HI> be but taken to the Regions of the Blessed all is well, wherever the <HI>body</HI> be dropt, in the sea, or on the dry land. God shews the Soul the path of life, and the <HI>flesh</HI> rests in hope. The soul is absent from the body to be present with the Lord: it departs and is with Christ: To whom else should it go? whither else would it be taken? When the <HI>Lord</HI> himself was going, he thus comfort∣ed
<PB N="12" REF="003011_0014_0FEF9EFA264BD928"/>his sorrowing <HI>Disciples,</HI> Joh. 14. init. <HI>I go to prepare a place for you and I will take you thither, that where I am there you may be also.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>Godly</HI> that are found <HI>alive</HI> at the coming of Christ shall be <HI>changed</HI> as <HI>Enoch</HI> was, and <HI>raised</HI> Saints shall be <HI>caught</HI> up with them to meet the Lord in the air. So we are ex∣presly taught, and a special attention to the thing is required of us; 1 Cor. 15.51, &amp;c. <HI>Behold I shew you a mystery; we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed; in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last Trump; for the trumpet shall sound &amp; the dead shall be raised, and we shall be changed: For this Corruptible must put on Incor∣ruption, and this Mortal must put on Immortality.</HI> This mystery relates to the <HI>Godly</HI> that shall be found alive at Christ's coming; They will not undergo the pains or change of <HI>death,</HI> a disso∣lution of Soul and body; No, but the easie and happy Change of <HI>Enoch.</HI> Their bodies by the power of Christ will be render'd spiritual and incorruptible in a moment of time in or∣der to their ascending up into the air, to meet their descending Lord. And because of the Certainty and Importance of this Truth it is repeated to us, 1 Thes. 4.15, 17. <HI>For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the Coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them which are asleep: For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Arch-angel and of the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="13" REF="003011_0015_0FEF9EFD28AB6850"/>Compare here the state and privilege of re∣deemed Saints in the Resurrection day: Some will have the singular privilege of not dying, not sleeping: The rest have all fallen asleep in Christ, and have undergone the change of death. Now one would be ready to think the advantage much on their side who do not die at all. But that it may not seem too much so, those that are to sleep in <HI>Jesus</HI> are informed and made to know, "That the <HI>Redeemers</HI> first care will be about his dead Saints". They that are found alive at the coming of Christ shall not prevent them that sleep; No, the dead in Christ shall rise first: Christ will raise his dead Servants before the great Change passes on them whom he shall find alive. So that if these last seem in one respect to have the advantage, the other will have it in ano∣ther respect, that there may be at last an equa∣lity; For the one being changed into spititual and glorious Bodies in the instant after that the Dead in Christ are so raised, they will both together be caught up to meet the Lord in the air. As blessed and joyful a moment to them all, as the Change and Translation of <HI>Enoch</HI> was to him! and as true and real a <HI>Translation.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. WHEN the <HI>Judgment</HI> is over Christ will return to the <HI>Third Heaven,</HI> the eternal Seat of the Blessed, with all his Elect and Redeemed, glorified in soul and body, <HI>to walk with him in white</HI> for ever more. So we read in the place last cited, 1 Thes. 4.18. <HI>And so shall we be ever with the Lord.</HI> Now where will <HI>He</HI> be after the Judgment day? He will return to
<PB N="14" REF="003011_0016_0FEF9EFFD740DD98"/>his <HI>Throne</HI> at the right hand of God in the highest Heaven, and his <HI>Redeemed</HI> will be there with him about his Throne for ever and ever, 1 Cor. 15.23, 24. <HI>Every man in his own order; Christ the first-fruits, afterward they that are Christ's at his coming: Then cometh the End, when he shall have delivered up the Kingdom to God, even the Father; having destroyed the last Enemy death.</HI> He will therefore carry up his redeemed with Him, and will present them unto God his <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> to be blessed by Him and in Him to all Eternity.</P>
<P>So he has <HI>prayed</HI> for them, and his Prayer is granted, Joh. 17.23. <HI>Father, I will that they whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me.</HI> And this he has also <HI>promised</HI> to 'em. Joh. 12.26. <HI>If any man serve me let him follow me, and where I am there shall my servant be.</HI></P>
<P>To this end our Lord both died and rose a∣gain, even to purchase and to receive this power, to take up all Believers into Glory with him: Joh. 17.3. <HI>As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life unto as many as thou hast given to him.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Eternal blessedness is described by the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> in those words, Rev. 2.4. <HI>And they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</HI> The walk is begun on earth in the life and ex∣ercise of Grace, but it continues and is perfect∣ed in the light of Life and Glory for ever. Holiness and Joy is that glorious <HI>White</HI> where∣in the Saints walk with Christ in Heaven. They are conform'd to Him, both as to Soul
<PB N="15" REF="003011_0017_0FEF9F046D1E3B60"/>and Body, in purity and splendour; <HI>fashion'd according to his glorious</HI> Body and Soul. This <HI>white</HI> is the righteousness of the Saints; their priestly and kingly Attire before the Throne of God; for they are <HI>made Kings &amp; Priests unto God.</HI> Such a garment of Glory was put upon Christ in the day of his <HI>Transfiguration,</HI> when his raiment became white and shining as the light, and such a <HI>Robe</HI> he will put upon his Saints at their <HI>Resurrection,</HI> and they shall walk with him therein for ever more. — In this <HI>white Enoch</HI> has been walking before the Throne of God from the Day wherein he was translated; and in the same will all Believers walk and shine to all Eternity.</P>
<P>BUT this for the <HI>Proof</HI> &amp; Illustration of the Doctrine. That God will take all such to Himself in another and better World, that walk with him in this World.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>USE.</HEAD>
<P>I come now to apply what has been said, and I might go into a very copious <HI>Application,</HI> but I must limit and restrain my self.</P>
<P><HI>WILL God indeed take those to himself in ano∣ther and better World that walk with Him here?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THEN first, Let us all be <HI>exhorted</HI> and ex∣cited to <HI>begin,</HI> and <HI>go on</HI> and <HI>persevere</HI> in a holy and blessed walk with God. Has there not eno' been said, tho' little on so glorious a Subject, to perswade and prevail on us to enter on <HI>a
<PB N="16" REF="003011_0018_0FEF9F0603B153E8"/>walk with God?</HI> View only the blessed <HI>End</HI> of it, to be <HI>taken</HI> up by God unto himself for ever and ever. O unknown happiness and im∣mense felicity! <HI>which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath enter'd into the heart of man to conceive of!</HI> Or if <HI>Paul</HI> after his rapture into the third heavens were to speak of to us, he could only say, that the things were <HI>nei∣ther lawful nor possible</HI> to be told us.</P>
<P>How much does it concern us then to <HI>ask</HI> our selves, Whether we have indeed <HI>begun</HI> this walk with God and to him? Whither are we <HI>going?</HI> what are we <HI>doing?</HI> how do we <HI>live</HI> and act? and what will become of us a few days hence? Will <HI>God take</HI> us? take us on the wings of Angels and in their Arms to his own Presence and Glory? or will <HI>death drag</HI> us out of the body, and <HI>devils</HI> take us away to their abodes of darkness and of fire unquenchable!</P>
<P>O let it be a loud call to Sinners, to walk no more in the counsel of the ungodly, nor go any further astray from God; but to return speedily to God with sincere and deep repen∣tance, and go in the way of good men and the blessed paths of the righteous; <HI>for the way of the ungodly shall perish, and their stops take hold of hall;</HI> They are going down to the pit, the pit of devils, and God will <HI>cast</HI> them from his face for ever, unless they repent. But if you have made <HI>a Covenant with death, and are at agreement with bell;</HI> if you would renounce God and Heaven, and are content not to be taken up to him when you go hence and are
<PB N="17" REF="003011_0019_0FEF9F07DEA96D20"/>here no more; then walk on, walk on in the ways of Sin and <HI>fy down in sorrow.</HI></P>
<P>O how would the late <HI>Servant of Christ and of Souls</HI> (who now lies by the <HI>Wall</HI> (as we speak) and his Mouth is stop by Death from speaking to us any more, and whom we hop'd when he last spake in this place to have heard again the next Week) how would he if he now stood in my place, have play'd the <HI>Artillery</HI> of Heaven, upon careless and insensible Sinners; and set all the <HI>Terrors</HI> of God in array before them; and told them how <HI>far</HI> they are from the bles∣sedness of <HI>Enoch</HI> in his end, being strangers to his <HI>walk</HI> with God? alienated from such a life, they must never be where he is; but on them his <HI>Prophesy</HI> is to take place for ever, <HI>Behold the Lord comes with ten thousand of his Saints to execuls Judgment on them for their un∣godly deeds,</HI> Jude v.15.</P>
<P>O you that are <HI>walking</HI> in the road to hell, <HI>after the prince of the power of the air,</HI> and whose fellowship is with devils; hear your <HI>doom</HI> from the mouth of Christ in the last Day, <HI>Depart from Me ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.—</HI> Go on now if you dare: God will take you away in his wrath.— So when <HI>Enoch</HI> had been long taken up, the <HI>Sinners</HI> whom he warn'd, but they would not believe or repent, sunk down together as a stone in the <HI>Flood.</HI> Even so at the end of the World when the <HI>Godly</HI> shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the air, the world of the <HI>ungodly</HI> (left below) will fly to the rocks and mountains to cover and hide them.—O awful
<PB N="18" REF="003011_0020_0FEF9F0AC80A6920"/>and amazing difference between Man and man at the coming of Christ! Luk. 17.34, 35. <HI>In that night two men shall be in one bed, the one shall be taken and the other left; two women shall be grinding together, the one shall be taken &amp; the other left; two men shall be in the field, the one shall be taken and the other left.</HI></P>
<P>BUT we are perswaded <HI>better things</HI> of many who are here present before God, even <HI>the Things that do accompany Salvation.</HI> Let those that (thro' Grace) <HI>are</HI> walking humbly with God, ask themselves how they <HI>go on</HI> in it? how <HI>far</HI> they are got in that blessed way? and let them ever keep their eye upon their <HI>End,</HI> the end of their faith, the Salvation of their Souls; which is nearer than when they first believed. —O let them humble and chide themselves that they have walked no more <HI>closely</HI> with God; that they have so often sadly <HI>wander'd</HI> and stray'd from the path of God's Command∣ments; that they have made so many <HI>stops,</HI> yea so often lain down and <HI>slumber'd &amp; slept:</HI> that they have been so <HI>slow</HI> &amp; dull at times in this heavenly walk, so sorrowful and <HI>heavy</HI> in it, yea so often <HI>weary</HI> and faint; too uncertain and unsteady at the best. We need to stir up our selves, take hold of God and follow hard after him. <HI>Let your loins be girt and your lamps burn∣ing, and be you as Men that wait for their Lord.</HI> — Be we <HI>followers of them who thro' Faith and Patience do inherit the Premises.</HI> And having <HI>so great a cloud of Witnesses before us, to lead us on, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin that doth most easily beset us, and let us run with pa∣tience
<PB N="19" REF="003011_0021_0FEF9F0F34EC7E10"/>the race that is set before us; looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith,</HI> and our great <HI>Example.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this for the <HI>first Use,</HI> which was to <HI>ex∣hort,</HI> to perswade and excite all of us <HI>to begin, go on &amp; persevere in a holy Walk with God.</HI> The other <HI>Use</HI> is,</P>
<P N="2">2. OF <HI>Comfort, Support</HI> and great <HI>Consolation</HI> to all them that have begun and are going on in a holy Walk with God. The <HI>Chariots</HI> of God are before them, even those that took <HI>Enoch</HI> up, to carry them to the <HI>Mansions in their Fa∣thers House.</HI> This should carry them above the <HI>fears</HI> of Death, and comfort them in the <HI>death</HI> of their godly Friends.</P>
<P N="1">1. WALK on with God, and <HI>be carried above the fears of death.</HI> It is the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of mortal Man to <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>prepare</HI> for his dying hour; and it is the true <HI>Happiness</HI> of Man here in the body to be <HI>ready</HI> for death and live <HI>above</HI> the fear of it. A walk with God is the way to <HI>both</HI> these. And tho' many of those that walk humbly with him, are <HI>all their life time subject to bondage thro' fear of death,</HI> yet it is their weakness and infirmity; and the <HI>Angel</HI> of the Lord would say to such, as he once did to the <HI>Women, Fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus</HI> that is risen from the dead.—Why was <HI>Enoch</HI> taken up, and why is <HI>Christ</HI> riser and ascended, but to <HI>rebuke</HI> such fears? You may face Death, while you are walking with God, and see in it <HI>the face of on Angel,</HI> coming to take you to God for ever. You may walk on with
<PB N="20" REF="003011_0022_0FEF9F10DFB11538"/>God <HI>down</HI> into the valley of the shadow of Death, and say, <HI>I will fear no evil for thou art with me.</HI> While you walk with God you may say with <HI>Christ, I walk to day and to morrow, and on the third day I shall be perfected.</HI> — Do you think that God will leave him at the hour of death, that has been walking with him thro' this life? No, the <HI>Angel</HI> of God, whose thou art, and whom thou servest, will stand by thee in that hour of darkness; the Angels of <HI>Jesus</HI> will gather about thee and bear thee up in their Arms. — Or if thy Friend &amp; Father should withdraw from thee for a moment, as he did from <HI>Christ,</HI> thy Faith has him still to look and cry to, <HI>My God, my God.</HI> — Allowance must be made for timerous Saints, yea the strongest Saints, both while they live and when they come to die. What a mighty <HI>Prince</HI> be∣fore God was <HI>Hezekiah?</HI> and how did his Faith and prayer prevail? yet when he came to die he remember'd how he <HI>had walk'd with God and wept sore,</HI> Isai. 38.3. Well, let the holy <HI>Tears</HI> run, they will be soon <HI>wip'd</HI> away for ever. Some are thus taken up weeping to the pleasures for ever more. — Let the fearing Saint consider, that <HI>Dying</HI> after a holy walk with God is in a manner as good as <HI>Enoch's</HI> be∣ing <HI>taken up.</HI> Where is the difference between the <HI>Chariots</HI> and horses of light that took up <HI>Elijah,</HI> and the <HI>Angels</HI> that carried the <HI>beggars</HI> Soul to the bosom of <HI>Abraham?</HI> Should God leave it to a Saints own choice, which way he would be taken, me thinks he would resign the matter back again into the pleasure and will
<PB N="21" REF="003011_0023_0FEF9F12E37EC2F0"/>of God; "Lord, as thou pleasest, and mayst be most glorified, one way or the other: they come to one and the same End.</P>
<P N="2">2. It should yield us the highest <HI>Consolation in the death of our Godly friends,</HI> that they have walked with God, and are not, for God has taken them. Had <HI>Enoch</HI> any mourners? think you: Or how could they weep for him? or for themselves? Surely only for themselves As when the <HI>Disciples</HI> saw <HI>Jesus</HI> ascend up into Heaven, <HI>they returned</HI> home <HI>with great joy.</HI> Or as the <HI>Sons</HI> of the Prophets that foresaw the Ascension of <HI>Elijah,</HI> spake of it with admiration and delight as to his part in it, and not with grief. Truly so there's abundant <HI>Comfort</HI> to affectionate Survivors in the <HI>way</HI> and in the <HI>end</HI> of every godly Person: They have <HI>walked</HI> with God and He has <HI>taken</HI> them to his Glory. Thus to live is Christ and to die is Gain. Whether to chuse we know not; let God do it. <HI>Enochs</HI> honour have all the Saints; praise ye the Lord. The <HI>Apostle</HI> rebukes immoderate sorrow over a <HI>Saints</HI> grave, 1 Thes. 4.13. <HI>I would not have you ignorant, Brethren, concerning them that are asleep, that ye sorrow not as those that have no hope: For if we believe that Jesus died, &amp; rose again even so also them that sleep in Jesus God will bring with him.</HI></P>
<P>WE must remember the <HI>holy walk</HI> of our de∣parted Friends and comfort our selves. We must remember where they now are: They are gone from us; God has taken 'em; they are <HI>with Christ which is far better;</HI> and <HI>when Christ
<PB N="22" REF="003011_0024_0FEF9F15E01AB830"/>shall appear</HI> they <HI>shall appear with him in glory,</HI>— What would any Believer have or wish more concerning those he loves, while they live or when they are dead? As our <HI>Lord</HI> said to his sorrowing <HI>Disciples,</HI> Joh. 14.28. <HI>If ye loved me ye would rejoyce, because I go to the Father.</HI></P>
<P>Go not <HI>to the grave to weep there:</HI> Why should you <HI>seek the Living among the dead?</HI> Lift up your head and eyes, look up to Heaven &amp; re∣joyce: Thither the precious Soul is taken, and there it is for ever comforted.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Elijah</HI> was taken up, there were some of his Friends and <HI>Sons</HI> that would go seek his body; <HI>It may be</HI> (said they) <HI>the Spirit of the Lord has dropt</HI> it here or there: No, said <HI>Elisha;</HI> Indulge no such fear or care about One whom God hath taken. Yet they went and sought in vain. So you may mourn and afflict your selves needlesly about such as God has taken up by Death, after a holy life and walk; But you ought rather to <HI>realize their Translation,</HI> by a <HI>Faith</HI> which is <HI>the Substance of things hoped for, and the Evidence of things unseen.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is one way of following our Godly Friends to Heaven; which should be our mournful care; that we may <HI>walk</HI> with God as they did, and that when we have finished our Course God may <HI>take</HI> us up to be with them; where they are beholding his Face for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="003011_0025_0FEF9F1862A63D40"/>
AND now all that are here present very well apprehend the Reason and Occasion of this <HI>Discourse.</HI> God has this Week taken up from us ONE whom he enabled by his Grace in a singular manner to <HI>walk with him.</HI> We mourn the <HI>Decease</HI> from us (not his <HI>Ascension</HI> to God) of the <HI>first Minister in the Town,</HI> the first in Age, in Gifts and in Grace; as all his Bre∣thren very readily own. I might add (it may be without offence to any) the <HI>first</HI> in the whole <HI>Province</HI> and <HI>Provinces</HI> of <HI>New England,</HI> for uni∣versal Literature; and extensive Services. Yea it may be among all the <HI>Fathers</HI> in these <HI>Chur∣ches,</HI> from the beginning of the <HI>Country</HI> to this day, of whom many have done worthily and <HI>greatly;</HI> yet none of them amass'd together so vast a <HI>Treasure</HI> of Learning, and made so much <HI>use</HI> of it, to a variety of pious Intentions, as this our Rev. Brother and Father, Dr. COTTON MATHER.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Name</HI> is like to live a great while among us in his <HI>printed Works;</HI> but yet <HI>these</HI> will not convey to Posterity, nor give to Strangers, a just Idea of the real <HI>Worth</HI> and great <HI>Learning</HI> of the <HI>Man.</HI> His <HI>Works</HI> will indeed inform all that read them of his great Knowledge, and singular Piety, his Zeal for God, and Holiness and Truth; and his desire of the Salvation of precious Souls; but it was <HI>Conversation</HI> and Acquaintance with him, in his familiar and occasional Discourses and private Communica∣tions, that discovered the vast compass of his Knowledge and the Projections of his Piety;
<PB N="24" REF="003011_0026_0FEF9F1C27A3D3C0"/>more I have sometimes thought than all his <HI>Pulpit</HI> Exercises. Here he excell'd, here he shone; being exceeding communicative, and bringing out of his <HI>Treasury</HI> things new &amp; old, without measure. Here it was seen how his Wit, and Fancy, his Invention, his Quickness of thought, and ready Apprehension were all consecrated to God, as well as his Heart Will and Affections; and out of his Abundance with∣in his <HI>ups</HI> overflow'd, <HI>dropt as the honey-comb, f;ed</HI> all that came near him, and were as the <HI>choice silver,</HI> for richness and brightness, plea∣sure and profit.</P>
<P>BUT here Love to <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Servant</HI> commands me to draw a <HI>Veil</HI> over every <HI>Fail∣ing:</HI> For <HI>who</HI> is without them? Not Ascend∣ing <HI>Elijah</HI> Himself; who was <HI>a man of like Passions</HI> with his Brethren the Prophets; and we have his <HI>Mantle</HI> left us wherewith to cover the Defects and Infirmities of <HI>Others</HI> after their <HI>Translation in Spirit.</HI> These God <HI>remembers no more,</HI> and why should we? and He <HI>blots out none of their good Deeds,</HI> and no more should we.</P>
<P>I trust therefore we may go on freely to say, That my <HI>Text</HI> was happily Exemplified in <HI>Him,</HI> even in his <HI>Walk with God</HI> from his Youth up: In his <HI>Closet</HI> the witness of his Prayers and Vigils and Tears; in his hard and constant <HI>Studies</HI> and preparations for the <HI>Pulpit</HI> and for the <HI>Press:</HI> in his <HI>Family,</HI> where the daily Sacrifices of Praise and Prayer were fol∣lowed
<PB N="25" REF="003011_0027_0FEF9F1F138E0AE0"/>with much of God and Christ &amp; Heaven, in an edifying and pleasant Conversation. His <HI>Visits</HI> to his Friends, and theirs to him, bear witness for him how much the Love of Christ was in his Heart and on his Tongue. Much more his more religious Visits to the <HI>Sick</HI> and Afflicted, to the Bereaved and to <HI>Mourners,</HI> to the <HI>Tempted</HI> and wounded in Spirit, or theirs to Him, may be suppos'd to bear witness for him. Not to omit his many charitable Visits to <HI>Prisoners</HI> under the Sentence of death, and his <HI>Labours</HI> with them, to save their Souls from the second Death.</P>
<P>IF we follow him to his <HI>public</HI> Labours, stated and occasional, on <HI>Lord's Days &amp; Lectures;</HI> how servent was he and unwearied, in Prayer and Preaching, in Intercessions and Exhortations? Here he show'd a flaming Love to <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Souls,</HI> and a vehement zeal against <HI>Sin</HI> and for <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Holiness.</HI> Among the <HI>Ministers</HI> in all their Meetings, he was very much the Mouth of <HI>God</HI> to them as well as <HI>theirs</HI> to God. The whole <HI>Israel</HI> of God, his Cause and Interest in a wicked World, lay always much upon his heart, and so did the <HI>Protestant Succession,</HI> the Civil and Religious Liberties of <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI> and those of his own <HI>Country.</HI> He truly lov'd his <HI>People,</HI> and had just notions of their true Interests. He was in the <HI>Gap</HI> for them on all Occasions, and wrestled in Prayer. He was a zealous Adorer and Assertor of the <HI>God-head of Christ;</HI> all his <HI>hope</HI> of Salvation standing on it, and the whole <HI>Mystery of Godliness.</HI>—
<PB N="26" REF="003011_0028_0FEF9F2209F74500"/>His <HI>Resignations</HI> to the Will of God were won∣derful under great Trials; and it seem'd one of the chief Aspirations of his Soul to honour God by <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> and to have his own <HI>Will</HI> swallowed up entirely in the Will of God. This he press'd vehemently on others in an evil and <HI>dying</HI> World, and this he practic'd himself. One of the <HI>last</HI> Words I heard him speak was in Admiration of the Grace of God in some of his near <HI>Relatives,</HI> in their exemplary Patience, Resignation and Devotion, under a great and sore <HI>Bereavement:</HI> He lift up his feeble Hand, and rais'd his sunk Voice, and earnestly said with a faultring Tongue, <HI>"O they do gloriously, they do gloriously, to honour God as they do with such a sacrificing Spirit".</HI> He sought not this <HI>World,</HI> but was very <HI>liberal</HI> of his lit∣tle, in uses of Piety and Charity. His heart was too good and big for <HI>earthly</HI> things, and too spiritual not to be set on <HI>higher</HI> and better; namely <HI>a more enduring Substance, a Treasure in Heaven that faileth not.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING was more familiar and frequent with him than <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Eternity.</HI> These he was ever speaking of with <HI>pleasure</HI> and desire, as one always <HI>ready</HI> and willing to be offer'd. And agreably he entertain'd all his <HI>Sicknesses</HI> with Constancy and Serenity, Tranquility and Peace; not shaken in mind nor afraid to die. He told me on the last <HI>Lord's-Day</HI> in the Even∣ing, with what a <HI>singular Satisfaction</HI> he had received the notice of Deaths approach that <HI>Morning,</HI> hoping to have been with Christ that <HI>Sacrament-day.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="003011_0029_0FEF9F25AA0E1148"/>
I shall only add, That according to the best Judgment I am able to make from mary years Observation and Conversation with him, he has seem'd to enjoy a fixed <HI>Peace</HI> and full <HI>Assu∣rance</HI> of Faith, as to his Interest in Christ and a better Life; And <HI>this</HI> continu'd with him to his last breath.</P>
<P>I leave it to <HI>Others</HI> to relate the holy <HI>Breath∣ings,</HI> and abundant gracious <HI>Words</HI> that flow'd from Him to every one that came about him, all the time of his Sickness and in his <HI>last</HI> Day and Hours; which whenever we see or hear they will be (it may be) one of the brightest Accounts we yet ever had of <HI>Grace and Peace,</HI> and living Comforts in dying Moments.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>he walked with God,</HI> and now <HI>he is not,</HI> as my Text says of <HI>Enoch.</HI> That is to say, He is no longer <HI>with us.</HI> Your eyes that have so often seen him in this <HI>Desk</HI> shall see him here no more, and this <HI>Place</HI> that has known him, and shown so much of him, shall <HI>know him no more.</HI> No more shall he be heard again in this <HI>Lecture,</HI> where he has ran so long and shining a <HI>Course:</HI> No more will he here <HI>weep</HI> over perishing Souls in <HI>Prayer;</HI> no more scatter the <HI>thunders &amp; lightnings</HI> of God in flaming <HI>Ser∣mons;</HI> no more like another <HI>Enoch</HI> warn the ungodly of the <HI>Lord's coming and judgment:</HI> No more is he to <HI>weary</HI> and spend himself, as we have often seen him wearied and <HI>spent</HI> for your Souls; "never weary of his work, but often wearied in it.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="003011_0030_0FEF9F2775481B30"/>
WHEN he stood last in <HI>this</HI> Place he was in weakness made strong; feeble in body but fer∣vent in Spirit; he spar'd not himself nor us; profuse of his own life for the lives of our Souls.</P>
<P>WE have no reason to doubt but God has taken him to Himself, where he long'd to be; taken him to the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> his last desire. He would not be <HI>bere</HI> again, unless for your <HI>Souls;</HI> And so <HI>Angels</HI> come down gladly, and for ought I know so may a <HI>Seperate</HI> Soul too.</P>
<P>HE is reaping (we believe) a glorious <HI>Harvest</HI> of all that he here sow'd: He <HI>sowed bounti∣fully</HI> and we believe <HI>reaps</HI> bountifully; appear∣ing to have had an <HI>abundant Entrance into the Joy of his Lord.</HI></P>
<P>AND if so, then He is as much taken up as <HI>Elias</HI> was, tho' not in the <HI>body.</HI> He <HI>freely</HI> went at God's Call, was not taken away by <HI>force,</HI> was willing to go, went <HI>placid</HI> and <HI>serene; E∣noch</HI> himself could scarce do more. And to me it seems a greater thing to <HI>die gladly</HI> and ascend only in <HI>Spirit,</HI> than to step joyfully, without dying, into <HI>Enochs Car.</HI> For who could do other than willingly <HI>mount the Chariot of light</HI> if he saw it come down for him with his bodily eyes? but to <HI>meet gastly Death,</HI> when he comes to take us out of the Body, and wil∣lingly go with him, leaving the body behind us to dust and worms; is something greater. To be able to walk down <HI>chearfully</HI> to a Grave,
<PB N="29" REF="003011_0031_0FEF9F29135F59C0"/>is a greater thing than to go up <HI>joyfully</HI> in the Body. — The Saints that shall <HI>never die</HI> may seem to come short of some of their <HI>Brethren</HI> in this; that while they are only <HI>caught up</HI> in∣to the Air to their Lord, their Brethren have pass'd <HI>thro' Death</HI> to go to him.

God make it <HI>so</HI> to us all; that for the few days to come, if indeed a <HI>few</HI> more may yet remain to us, we may more than ever pray and preach and hear and communicate as <HI>dying Persons.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>this</HI> word comes nearest to <HI>my self,</HI> under manifest decays, and next in order of time to the <HI>Deceased,</HI> and therefore ought to expect next to <HI>die:</HI> Pray for <HI>me,</HI> and for my <HI>Brethren your dear Pastors,</HI> that we may so <HI>walk with God</HI> as the <HI>De∣ceased</HI> has done before us, and that in God's time we may <HI>be taken</HI> as he has been; that after some like <HI>Usefulness</HI> we also may depart in the like blessed <HI>Peace,</HI> by the
<PB N="31" REF="003011_0033_0FEF9F3061FB91D8"/>free Grace of God. — <HI>Our God is able to supply all our Needs, according to his riches in Glory by Jesus Christ. Now unto God and our Father be Glory, for Ever. Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE Learned <HI>Monsieur SAURIN</HI> in his <HI>Dissertations upon the Old Testament</HI> says, "That this only Expression is the most beautiful of all Elogies, <HI>Enoch pleased God.</HI>—He adds, That we have a very strong Pre∣sumption of this <HI>Fact,</HI> that <HI>Enoch was indeed translated and did not see Death,</HI> because <HI>Moses</HI> at the End of the Lives of those <HI>Pa∣triarchs</HI> that both preceeded and followed <HI>Enoch</HI> hath this Expression, <HI>that he died.</HI> He does as it were affect this Style; and it may be presumed that he would not have altered it just upon mentioning <HI>Enoch,</HI> if that holy Man had the same Destiny. Besides, the manner in which <HI>Moses</HI> speaks of the Assumption of <HI>Enoch</HI> makes it appear as a favour granted to his great Endeavours of pleasing God: <HI>Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.</HI></P>
<P>IT was a more singular thing in that <HI>First Age</HI> of the World, that a Man of distin∣guished Piety should live but 365 years, while the greatest part of the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> came nearer to a thousand. This made so
<PB REF="003011_0035_0FEF9F36EC60DED0"/>great an Impression upon a <HI>Robin</HI> who un∣desstood it to mean no more than an ordina∣ry Death, that he chose rather to blast the Memory of this <HI>Patriarch</HI> than to suppose that God would take a good Man so in the midst of his days, in that Age of the World. <HI>"Enochs Righteousness</HI> (says the <HI>Robin</HI>) <HI>was but ambulatory and fleeting, and this was the Reason that God precipitated his Death".</HI> An ignorant and base Reflection.</P>
<P>IN each of the <HI>three</HI> great Periods of the Church, there has been an <HI>Instance</HI> of a Man taken up to Heaven in Body and Soul; for the supporting the Hopes conceived by all the Faithful, of arriving at the same happiness: <HI>Enoch</HI> before the <HI>Law, Elijah</HI> under it, and <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> under the <HI>Gospel</HI> Oeconomy. 'Twas a favourable <HI>Prejudice</HI> for the Faithful of the <HI>First</HI> World, to see <HI>a good Man</HI> vanish away, and after his sojourning upon the Earth to be lodged in some other place than a Tomb. 'Twas yet a stronger <HI>Presumption</HI> in favour of those that lived in the <HI>second</HI> Period, to see the Heavens opened for the Reception of one of their <HI>Prophets,</HI> who was carried up thi∣ther in a Chariot of Fire. But it is a <HI>Demon∣stration</HI> to <HI>Christians,</HI> and as it were a taking Possession of their expected Happiness, to see the <HI>Author &amp; Finisher of their Faith</HI> passing
<PB REF="003011_0036_0FEF9F3ADC1E45D0"/>thro' those vast Spaces that divide Heaven from the Earth; and to hear the Church Tri∣umphant Summoning the Gates of the Pa∣lace of Glory to be open'd, and to receive Him who was going before to prepare the Places that He had allotted for them in those happy Mansions. <HI>Such an High-Priest be∣came us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, sepa∣rate from Sinners, and made higher than the Heavens".</HI></P>
