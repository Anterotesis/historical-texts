<P>MR. HUME, a few months before his death, wrote the folow∣ing short account of his own Life; and, in a codicil to his will▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esired that it might be prefixed to the next edition of his Worl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ That edition cannot be published for a considerable time. The Editor, in the mean while, in order to serve the purchasers of the former editions; and, at the same time, to gratify the impatience of the public curiosity; has thought proper to publish it separately, without, altering even the title or superscription, which was written in Mr. Hume's own hand on the cover of the manuscript.</P>

<HEAD>MY OWN LIFE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is difficult for a man to speak long of himself without vani∣ty; therefore, I shall be short. It may be thought an instance of va∣nity that I pretend at all to write my life; but this Narrative shall contain little more than the His∣tory of my Writings; as, indeed, almost all my life has been spent in literary pursuits and occupati∣ons. The first success of most of my writings was not such as to be an object of vanity.</P>
<P>I was born the 26th of April 1711, old style, at Edinburgh. I was of a good family, both by father and mother: my father's family is a branch of the Earl of Home's, or Hume's; and my ancestors had been proprietors of the estate, which my brother pos∣sesses, for several generations. My mother was daughter of Sir David Falconer, President of the College of Justice: the title of Lord Halkerton came by succes∣sion to her brother.</P>
<P>My family, however, was not rich, and being myself a younger brother, my patrimony, accord∣ing to the mode of my country, was of course very slender. My father, who passed for a man of parts, died when I was an infant, leaving me, with an elder bro∣ther and a sister, under the care of our mother, a woman of sin∣gular merit, who, though young and handsome, devoted herself entirely to the rearing and edu∣cating of her children. I passed through the ordinary course of e∣ducation with success, and was seized very early with a passion for literature, which has been the ruling passion of my life, and the great source of my enjoyments. My studious disposition, my so∣briety, and my industry, gave my family a notion that the law
<PB N="4" REF="015853_0003_0F9A2E6F10094D08"/>
was a proper profession for me; but I found an unsurmountable a∣version to every thing but the pursuits of philosophy and gene∣ral learning; and while they fan∣cied I was poring upon Voet and Vinnius, Cicero and Virgil were the authors which I was secretly devouring.</P>
<P>My very slender fortune, how∣ever, being unsuitable to this plan of life, and my health being a little broken by my ardent ap∣plication, I was tempted, or ra∣ther forced, to make a very fee∣ble trial for entering into a more a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ive scene of life. In 1734, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t to Bristol, with some re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mmendations to eminent mer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hants, but in a few months found that scene to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally unsuitable to me. I went over to France, with a view of prosecuting my studies in a country retreat; and I there laid that plan of life, which I have steadily and suc∣cessfully pursued. I resolved to make a very rigid frugality sup∣ply my deficiency of fortune, to maintain unimpaired my inde∣pendency, and to regard every object as contemptible, except the improvement of my talents in literature.</P>
<P>During my retreat in France, first at Reims, but chiefly at La Fleche, in Anjou I composed my <HI>Treatise of Human Nature.</HI> After passing three years very a∣greeably in that country, I came over to Lond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in 1737. In the end of 1738, I published my Treatise, and immediately went down to my mother and my bro∣ther, who lived at his country-house, and was employing him∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lf very judiciously and success∣fully in the improvement of his fortune</P>
<P>Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my Trea∣tise of Human Nature. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fell <HI>dead born from the press,</HI> without reaching such distinction, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> even to excite a mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the zealots. But being nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a cheerful and sanguine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I very soon recovered the blow, and prosecuted with great ardo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r my studies in the country. In 1742, I printed at Edi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>burgh the first part of my Essays: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he work was favourably received, and soon made me entirely forget my for∣mer disappointment. I continued with my mother and brother in the country, and in that time re∣covered the knowledge of the Greek language, which I had too much neglected in my early youth.</P>
<P>In 1745, I received a letter from the Marquis of Annandale, inviting me to come and live with him in England; I found also, that the friends and family of that young nobleman were desirous of putting him under my care and direction, for the state of his mind and health required it.—I lived with him a twelve-month. My appointments during that time made a considerable accession to my small fortune. I then re∣ceived an invitation from Gene∣ral St. Clair to attend him as a secretary to his expedition, which was at first meant against Cana∣da, but ended in an incursion on the coast of France. Next year, to wit, 1747, I received an invi∣tation fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m the General to attend him in the same station in his mi∣litary embassy to the courts of Vienna and Turin. I then wore the uniform of an officer, and was introduced at there courts as aid-de-camp to the general, along
<PB N="5" REF="015853_0004_0F9A2E6FCEF550B0"/>
with Sir Harry Erskine and Cap∣tain Grant, now General Grant. These two years were almost the only interruptions which my stu∣dies have received during the course of my life: I passed them agreeably, and in good company; and my appointments, with my frugality, had made m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reach a fortune, which I called indepen∣dent, though most of my friends were inclined to smile when I said so; in short, I was now master of near a thousand pounds.</P>
<P>I had always entertained a na∣tion, that my want of success in publishing the Treatise of Human Nature, had proceeded more from the manner than the matter, and that I had been guilty of a very usual indiscretion, in going to the press too early. I, therefore, cast the first part of that work anew in the Enquiry concerning Human Understanding, which was pub∣lished while I was at Turin. But this piece was at first little more successful than the Treatise of Human Nature On my return from Italy, I had the mortificati∣on to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd all England in a fer∣ment, on account <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dr. Middle∣ton's Free E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quiry, while my perfo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mance was entirely over∣looked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd neglected. A new e∣dition, which had been published at London of my Essays, moral and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>litical met not with a much better reception.</P>
<P>Such is the force of na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l temper, that these disappoint∣ments mad little or a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> impressi∣on on me. I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt down in 1749, and lived two years with my bro∣ther at his country house, for my mother was now dead; I there composed the second part of my Essays, which I called Political Discourses, and also my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Mo∣rals, which is another part of my treatise that I cast anew. Mean∣while, my bookseller, A. Millar, informed me, that my former publications (all but the unfortu∣nate Treatise) were beginning to be the subject of conversation; that the sale of them was gradu∣ally increasing, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow e∣ditions were dema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. Answers by Reverends, and Right Reve∣rends, came out two or thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> year; and I fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> War∣burton's railing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s were beginning to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in good company. However, I had fixed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> resolution, which I infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>x∣ibly maintained, never to reply to any body; and not being very irascible in my temper, I have easily kept myself clear of all li∣terary squabbles. These symp∣toms of a rising reputation gav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me encouragement, as I was ever more disposed to see the favoura∣ble than unfavourable side of things; a turn of mind which it is more happy to possess, than to be born to an estate at ten thou∣sand a year.</P>
<P>In 1751, I removed from the country to the town, the true scene for a man of letters. In 1752, were published at Edin∣burgh, where I then lived, my Political Discourses, the only work of mine that was successful on the first publication. It was well received abroad and at home. In the same year was published at London, my Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals; which, in my own opinion (who ought not to judge on that subject), is of all my writings, historical, philosophical, or literary, incom∣parably the best. It came unno∣ticed and unobserved into the world.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="015853_0005_0F9A2E709FCB9A48"/>In 1752, the Faculty of Advo∣cates chose me their Librarian, an office from which I received little or no emolument, but which gave me the command of a large library. I then formed the plan of writing the History of Eng∣land; but being frightened with the notion of continuing a narra∣tive through a period of 1700 years, I commenced with the ac∣cession of the House of Stuart, an epoch when, I thought, the mis∣representations of faction began chiefly to take place. I was, I own, sanguine in my expectati∣ons of the success of this work. I thought that I was the only his∣torian, that had at once neglected present power, interest, and au∣thority, and the cry of popular prejudices; and as the subject was suited to every capacity, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xpected proportional applause. But miserable was my disappoint∣ment: I was assailed by one cry of reproach, disapprobation, and even detestation; English, Scotch, and Irish, Whig and Tory, churchman and sectary, free∣thinker and religionist, patriot and courtier, united in their rage against the man, who had pre∣sumed to shed a generous tear for the fate of Carles. I. and the Earl of Strafford; and after the first ebullitions of their fury were over, what was still more morti∣fying, the book seemed to sink into oblivion. Mr. Millar told me, that in a twelvemonth he sold only forty-five copies of it. I scarc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, indeed, heard of one man in the three kingdoms, con∣siderable for rank or letters, that could endure the book. I must only except the primate of Eng∣land, O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Herring, and the pri∣mate of Ireland, Dr. Stone, which seem two odd exceptions. These dignified prelates separate∣ly sent me messages not to be dis∣couraged.</P>
<P>I was, however, I confess, dis∣couraged; and had not the war been at that time breaking out between France and England, I had certainly retired to some pro∣vincial town of the former king∣dom, have changed my name, and never more have returned to my native country. But as this scheme was not now practicable, and the subsequent volume was considerably advanced, I resolved to pick up courage and to perse∣vere.</P>
<P>In this interval, I published at London my Natural History of Religion, along with some other small pieces: its public entry was rather obscure, except only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet a∣gainst it, with all the illiberal petulance, arrogance, and scur∣rility, which distinguish the War∣burtonian school. This pam∣phlet gave some consolation for the otherwise indifferent recepti∣on of my performance.</P>
<P>In 1756, two years after the fall of the first volume, was pub∣lished the second volume of my History, containing the period from the death of Charles I. till the Revolution. This perform∣ance happened to give less dis∣pleasure to the Whigs, and was better received. It not only rose itself, but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother.</P>
<P>But though I had been taught by experience, that the Whig party were in possession of bellow∣ing all places, both in the state and in literature, I was so little inclined to yield to their senseless clamour, that in above a hundred
<PB N="7" REF="015853_0006_0F9A2E7150A44CB8"/>
alterations, which farther study, reading, or reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two first Stuarts, I have made all of them invariably to the Tory side. It is ridiculous to consider the English constitution before that period as a regular plan of li∣berty.</P>
<P>In 1759, I published my His∣tory of the House of Tudor. The clamour against this performance was almost equal to that against the History of the two first Stu∣arts. The reign of Elizabeth was particularly obnoxious. But I was now callous against the im∣pressions of public folly, and con∣tinued very peaceably and con∣tentedly in my retreat at Edin∣burgh, to finish, in two volumes, the more early part of the English History, which I gave to the public in 1761, with tolerable, and but tolerable success.</P>
<P>But, notwithstanding this va∣riety of winds and seasons, to which my writings had been ex∣posed, they had still been making such advances, that the copy-money given me by the booksel∣lers, much exceeded any thing formerly known in England; I was become not only indepen∣dent, but opulent. I retired to my native country of Scotland, determined never more to set my foot out of it; and retaining the satisfaction of never having pre∣ferred a request to one great man, or even making advances of friendship to any of them. As I was now turned of fifty, I thought of passing all the rest of my life in this philosophical manner, when I received, in 1763, an invitation from the Earl of Hertford, with whom I was not in the least ac∣quainted, to attend him on his embassy to Paris, with a near prospect of being appointed secre∣tary to the embassy; and, in the meanwhile, of performing the functions of that office. This offer, however inviting, I at first declined, both because I was re∣luctant to begin connexions with the great, and because I was a∣fraid that the civilities and gay company of Paris, would prove disagreeable to a person of my age and humour: but on his lordship's repeating the invitation, I ac∣cepted of it. I have every reason, both of pleasure and interest, to think myself happy in my con∣nexions with that nobleman, as well as afterwards with his bro∣ther, General Conway.</P>
<P>Those who have not seen the strange effects of modes, will ne∣ver imagine the reception I met with at Paris, from men and wo∣men of all ranks and stations. The more I resiled from their ex∣cessive civilities, the more I was loaded with them. There is, however, a real satisfaction in living at Paris, from the great number of sensible, knowing, and polite company with which that city abounds above all places in the universe. I thought once of settling there for life.</P>
<P>I was appointed secretary to the embassy; and in summer 1765, Lord Hertford left me, being ap∣pointed Lord Lieutenant of Ire∣land. I was <HI>charge d' affaires</HI> till the arrival of the Duke of Rich∣mond, towards the end of the year, In the beginning of 1766, I left Paris, and next summer went to Edinburgh, with the same view as formerly, of bury∣ing myself in a philosophical re∣treat. I returned to that place, not richer, but with much more
<PB N="8" REF="015853_0007_0F9A2E721276F1A8"/>
money, and a much larger in∣come, by mean's of Lord Hert∣ford's friendship, than I left it; and I was desirous of trying what superfluity could produce, as I had fomerly made an experiment of a competency. But, in 1767, I received from Mr Conway an invitation to be Under-secretary; and this invitation, both the cha∣racter of the person, and my con∣nexions with Lord Hertford, pre∣vented me from declining. I re∣turned to Edinburgh in 1769, ve∣ry opulent (for I possessed a reve∣nue of 1060l. a year), healthy, and though somewhat stricken in years, with the prospect of en∣joying long my ease, and of see∣ing the increase of my reputation.</P>
<P>In spring 1775, I was struck with a disorder in my bowels, which at first gave me no alarm, but has since, as I apprehend it, become mortal and incurable. I now reckon upon a speedy disso∣lution. I have suffered very little pain from my dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rder; and what is more strange, have, notwith∣standing the great decline of my person, never suffered a moment's abatement of my spirits; inso∣much, that were I to name the period of my life, which I should most choose to pass over again, I might be tempted to point to this later period. I possess the same ardour as ever in study, and the same gaiety in company. I con∣sider, besides, that a man of sixty five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmities; and though I see many symptoms of my literary reputation's breaking out at last with additional lustre, I knew that I could have but very few years to enjoy it. It is diffi∣cult to be more detached from life than I am at present.</P>
<P>To conclude historically with my own character. I am, or ra∣ther was (for that is the style I must now use in speaking of my∣self which embordens me the more to speak my sentiments); I was, I say, a man of mild dispo∣sitions, of command of temper, of an open, social, and cheerful humour, capable of attachment, but little susceptible of enmity, and of great moderation in all my passions. Even my love of literary fame, my ruling passion, never soured my temper, not∣withstanding my frequent disap∣pointments. My company was not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary; and as I took a particular pleasure in the company of modest women, I had no reason to be displeased with the reception I met with from them. In a word, though most men any wise eminent, have found reason to complain of ca∣lumny, I never was touched, or even attacked by her baleful tooth: and though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had occasion to vin∣dicate any one circumstance of my character and conduct: not but that the zealots, we may well suppose, would have been glad to invent and propagate any story to my disadvantage but they could never find any which they thought would wear the face of probabili∣ty. I cannot say there is no va∣nity in making this funeral ora∣tion of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which is easily cleared and ascertained.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER FROM ADAM SMITH, LL. D. TO WILLIAM STRAHAN, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Giving some Account of Mr. HUME, during his last Sickness.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Kirkaldy, Fifeshire, <DATE>Nov. 9, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with a real, though a ve∣ry melancholy pleasure, that I sit down to give you some ac∣count of the behaviour of our late excellent friend, Mr. Hume, during his last illness.</P>
<P>Though, in his own judgment, his disease was mortal and incur∣able, yet he allow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d himself to be prevailed upon, by the entreaty of his friends, to try what might be the effects of a long journey. A few days before he set out, he wrote that account of his own life, which, together with his o∣ther papers, he has left to your care. My account, therefore, shall begin where his ends.</P>
<P>He set out for London towards the end of April, and at Mor∣peth met with Mr. John Home and myself, who had both come down from London on purpose to see him, expecting to have found him at Edinburgh. Mr. Home returned with him, and attended him during the whole of his stay in England, with that care and attention which might be expect∣ed from a temper so perfectly friendly and affectionate. As I had written to my mother that she might expect me in Scotland, I was under the necessity of con∣tinuing my journey. His disease seemed to yield to exercise and change of air, and when he ar∣rived in London, he was appa∣rently in much better health than when he left Edinburgh. He was advised to go to Bath to drink the waters, which appeared for some time to have so good an ef∣fect upon him, that even he him∣self began to entertain, what he was not apt to do, a better opini∣on of his own health. His symp∣toms, however, soon returned with their usual violence, and from that moment he gave up all thoughts of recovery, but sub∣mitted with the utmost cheerful∣ness, and the most perfect com∣placency and resignation. Upon his return to Edinburgh, though he found himself much weaker, yet his cheerfulness never abated, and he continued to divert him∣self, as usual, with correcting his own works for a new edition, with reading books of amuse∣ment, with the conversation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="10" REF="015853_0009_0F9A2E73A83FA660"/>
his friends; and, sometimes in the evening, with a party at his favourite game of whist. His cheerfulness was so great, and his conversation and amusements run so much in their usual strain, that, notwithstanding all bad symptoms, many people could not believe he was dying. <Q>I shall tell your friend, Colonel Edmondstone,</Q> said Doctor Dundas to him one day, <Q>that I left you much better, and in a fair way of recovery.</Q>— "Doctor," said he, <Q>as I be∣lieve you would not chuse to tell any thing but the truth, you had better tell him, that I am dying as fast as my ene∣mies, if I have any, could wish, and as easily and cheer∣fully as my best friends could desire.</Q> Colonel Edmond∣stone soon afterwards came to see him, and take leave of him; and on his way home, he could not forbear writing him a letter bid∣ding him once more an eternal adieu, and applying to him, as to a dying man, the beautiful French verses in which the Abbé Chaulieu, in expectation of his own death, laments his approach∣ing separation from his friend, the Marquis de la Fare, Mr. Hume's magnanimity and firm∣ness were such, that his most af∣fectionate friends knew, that they hazarded nothing in talking or writing to him as to a dying man, and that so far from being hurt by this frankness, he was rather pleased and flattered by it. I happened to come into his room while he was reading this letter, which he had just received, and which he immediately showed me. I told him, that though I was sensible how very much be was weakened, and that appear∣ances were in many respects very bad, yet his cheerfulness was still so great, the spirit of life seemed still to be so very strong in him, that I could not help entertaining some faint hopes. He answered, <Q>Your hopes are groundless. An habitual diarrhoea of more than a year's standing, would be a very bad disease at any age: at my age it is a mortal one. When I lie down in the evening. I feel myself weaker than when I rose in the morn∣ing; and when I rise in the morning, weaker than when I lay down in the evening. I am sensible, besides, that some of my vital parts are affected, so that I must soon die.</Q>— "Well," said I, "if it must be so, you have at least the satis∣faction of leaving all your friends, your brother's family in particu∣lar, in great prosperity." He said, that he felt that satisfaction so sensibly, that when he was reading a few days before, Lu∣cian's Dialogues of the Dead, among all the excuses which are alledged to Charon for not enter∣ing readily into his boat, he could not find one that fitted him; he had no house to finish, he had no daughter to provide for, he had no enemies upon whom he wished to revenge himself. <Q>I could not well imagine, said he, what excuse I could make to Charon in order to obtain a little delay.

all reason to die contented.</Q> He then diverted himself with inventing several jocular excuses, which he supposed he might make to Charon, and with imagining the very surly answers which it might suit the character of Cha∣ron to return to them. <Q>Upon further consideration, said he, I thought I might say to him, Good Charon, I have been correcting my works for a new edition. Allow me a little time, that I may see how the Public receives the altera∣tions.</Q> But Charon would answer, <Q>When you have seen the effect of these, you will be for making other alterations.

Do you fancy I will grant you a lease for so long a term? Get into the boat this instant, you lazy loitering rogue.</Q></P>
<P>But, though Mr. Hume always talked of his approaching dissolu∣tion with great cheerfulness, he never affected to make any parade of his magnanimity. He never mentioned the subject but when the conversation naturally led to it, and never dwelt longer upon it than the course of the conver∣sation happened to require: it was a subject indeed which oc∣curred pretty frequently, in con∣sequence of the inquiries which his friends, who came to see him, naturally made concerning the state of his health. The conver∣sation which I mentioned above, and which passed on Thursday the 8th of August, was the last, except one, that I ever had with him. He had now become so very weak, that the company of his most intimate friends fatigued him; for his cheerfulness was still so great, his complaisance and social disposition were still so entire, that when any friend was with him, he could not help talk∣ing more, and with greater ex∣ertion, than suited the weakness of his body. At his own desire, therefore, I agreed to leave Edin∣burgh, where I was staying part∣ly upon his account, and return∣ed to my mother's house here, at Kirkaldy, upon condition that he would send for me whenever he wished to see me; the physici∣an who saw him most frequently, Doctor Black, undertaking, in the mean time, to write me occa∣sionally an account of the state of his health.</P>
<P>On the 22d of August, the Doctor wrote me the following letter:</P>
<P>"Since my last, Mr. Hume has passed his time pretty easily, but is much weaker. He sits up, goes down stairs once a day, and amuses himself with reading, but seldom sees any body. He finds that even the conversation of his most intimate friends fatigues and oppresses him; and it is happy that he does not need it, for he is quite free from anxiety, impati∣ence, or low spirits, and passes his time very well with the assist∣ance of amusing books."</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Yesterday about four o'clock afternoon, Mr. Hume expired. The near approach of his death became evident in the night be∣tween Thursday and Friday, when his disease became exces∣sive, and soon weakened him so much, that he could no longer rise out of his bed. He conti∣nued to the last perfectly sensible, and free from much pain or feel∣ings of distress. He never drop∣ped the smallest expression of im∣patience; but when he had occa∣sion to speak to the people about him, always did it with affection and tenderness. I thought it im∣proper to write to bring you over, especially as I heard that he had dictated a letter to you desiring you not to come. When he be∣came very weak it cost him an ef∣fort to speak, and he died in such a happy composure of mind, that nothing could exceed it.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Thus died our most excellent, and never to be forgotten friend; concerning whose philosophical opinions men will, no doubt, judge variously, every one ap∣proving, or condemning them, according as they happen to co∣incide or dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gree with his own; but concerning whose character and conduct there can scarce be a difference of opinion. His tem∣per, indeed, seemed to be more happily balanced, if I may be al∣lowed such an expression, than that perhaps of any other man I have ever known. Even in the lowest state of his fortune, his great and necessary frugality ne∣ver hindered him from exercising upon p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oper occasions, acts both of charity and generosity. It was a frugality founded, not up∣on avarice, but upon the love of independency. The extreme gen∣tleness of his nature never weak∣ened either the firmness of his hand, or the steadiness of his re∣solutions. His constant pleasant∣ry was the genuine effusion of good-nature and good-humour, tempered with delicacy and mo∣desty, and without even the slightest tincture of malignity, so frequently the disagreeable source of what is called wit in other men. it never was the meaning of his raillery to mortify; and therefore, far from offending, it seldom sailed to please and de∣light, even those who were the

objects of it, To his friends, who were frequently the objects of it, there was not perhaps any one of all his great and amiable quali∣ties, which contributed more to endear his conversation. And that gaiety of temper, so agreea∣ble in society, but which is so of∣ten accompanied with frivolous and superficial qualities, was in him certainly attended with the most severe application, the most extensive learning, the greatest depth of thought, and a capacity in every respect the most compre∣hensive. Upon the whole, I have always considered him, both in his life-time and since his death, as approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man; as perhaps the na∣ture of human frailty will permit.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>LES VOYAGES D'UN PHILO∣SOPHE of M. le Poivre have been much admired in France. They were originally read before the Royal Society of Agriculture at Lyons, of which he was presi∣dent, and afterwards before the Royal Society of Paris. For sometime they were handed about in manuscript, and at length, found their way to the press.</P>
<P>M. le Poivre's manner is easy and elegant; his observations striking and judicious; his senti∣ments humane and benevolent.— The genuine happiness of every nation must depend on agricul∣ture, and agriculture must ever be influenced by established laws and modes of government: na∣ture indulgently smiles on the labour of a free-born people, but shrinks with horror from the ty∣rant and the slave. This is his system, and it is the system of truth, founded on experience, and supported not only by com∣paring cotemporary nations, but by contrasting nations with them∣selves at different periods.</P>
<P>It is necessary the reader should keep in view the country of the author, as many of his strictures on European agriculture, though unapplicable perhaps to Britain, convey a descriptive picture of the state of cultivation in France.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY people, however bar∣barous, have arts peculiar to themselves. The diversity of cli∣mates, whilst it varies the wants of mankind, offers to their indus∣try different productions on which to exercise it. Every country, at a certain degree of distance, has fabrics so singularly peculiar to itself, that they could not have been the fabrics of other regions: but agriculture, in every climate, is the universal art of mankind: from one extreme of the globe to the other, nations still barbarous, as well as those whose ideas are civilized, procure to themselves, at least, a part of their subsistence by the culture of their fields; yet this art, however universal, is not every where equally flourish∣ing.</P>
<P>It never fails to prosper among wise nations, who know how to honour and encourage it;—it supports itself but feebly amongst a people half polished, who ei∣ther prefer to it frivolous arts, or who, being sufficiently enlight∣ened perhaps to perceive its uti∣lity, are still too much slaves to the prejudices of their ancient barbarity, to affranchize and confer honours on those who ex∣ercise it;—it languishes, and its influence is scarcely to be ob∣served amongst barbarians, who despise it.</P>
<P>The state of agriculture has e∣ver been the principal object of my researches among the various people I have seen in the course of my voyages. It is almost im∣possible for a traveller, who per∣haps only passes through a coun∣try, to make such remarks as are necessary to convey a just idea of the government, police, and man∣ners
<PB N="18" REF="015853_0015_0F9A2E781183C7A8"/>
of the inhabitants. In such a case, the criterion which best marks the internal state of a na∣tion, is to observe the public markets, and the face of the country. If the markets abound in provisions, if the fields are well cultivated, and covered with rich crops, then in general you may conclude that the country is well peopled, that the inhabitants are civilized and happy, that their manners are polished, and their government agreeable to the prin∣ciples of reason. — You may then say to yourself, I am amongst <HI>Men.</HI></P>
<P>When, on the contrary, I have arrived amongst a people, whom it was necessary to search for a∣midst forests, whose neglected lands were overgrown with bram∣bles; when I have traversed large tracts of uncultivated desarts, and then at last stumbled on a grub∣bed up wretchedly cultivated field; when arrived at length at some canton, I have observed nothing in the public market but a few sorry roots, I no longer hesitated to determine the inhabitants to be wretched savages, or groaning under the most oppressive slavery.</P>
<P>I never remember a single in∣stance of being obliged to retract this first idea, conceived simply by inspecting the state of agricul∣ture amongst the various nations I have seen: the knowledge of various particulars, which a long residence among many of them has enabled me to acquire, has ever confirmed me in opinion, that a country poorly cultivated is always inhabited by men bar∣barous or oppressed, and that population there can never be considerable.</P>
<P>You will observe by the detail I now offer you of my enquiries, that in every country agriculture depends absolutely on the laws, the manners, and even on the esta∣blished prejudices of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> respec∣tive inhabitants. I shall begin with observations on some parts of Africa.</P>

<HEAD>TRAVELS OF A PHILOSOPHER.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of area">
<HEAD>Of the Western Coasts of <HI>AFRICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE islands and western districts of this part of the world which I have seen, are for the greater part uncultivated lands, inhabited by unhappy ne∣groes. These wretched men, who have so poor an estimation of themselves as to sell one another, never employ a thought on the cultivation of their lands. Satis∣fied to exist from day to day, un∣der a climate where their wants are few, they cultivate just as much as prevents their dying of hunger; they carelesly sow every year some maize, a very little rice; and plant, in small quanti∣ties, different kinds of potatoes, not of the nature of ours, though the culture is much the same; we know them by the name of <HI>yams.</HI> In general their harvests are so poor, that the Europeans, who resort to them for the purchase of slaves, are obliged to bring from Europe or America the provisions necessary for the maintenance of those unfortunate creatures doom∣ed to compose their cargoes.</P>
<P>The negroes, who inhabit the environs of the European colonies, give somewhat more attention to agriculture than the others.— They rear flocks; they cultivate rice in greater quantities; and in their gardens are found pulse, of which the seed has been brought from Europe; yet all they know of agriculture, they have learnt from the Europeans settled a∣mongst them; their own experi∣ence is extremely bounded; and I have never been able to discover in their industry any process which could in the least improve our own.</P>
<P>From the river of Angola to Cape Negroe, and from thence till you approach the Cape of Good Hope, nothing is to be seen but sterile uncultivated lands; the coasts are naked and covered with barren sands; and you are under the necessity of travelling many leagues before you can dis∣cover a palm-tree, or the slightest verdure. The country and its few inhabitants seem to be struck with one common curse. From the informations I have received touching these countries from the Italian missionaries, who with an admirable zeal have penetrated into the heart of these accursed regions, I learn likewise that a∣griculture is just as languid in the
<PB N="20" REF="015853_0017_0F9A2E798FBF8A38"/>
interior parts as upon the coasts, although, in many places, the soil appeared much more fruitful from its natural productions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of area">
<HEAD>The <HI>CAPE</HI> of <HI>GOOD HOPE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE countries around the Cape were condemned to the same sterility before the Dutch took possession of them; but since their establishment on this point of Africa, the lands produce in abundance wheat and grain of every kind, wines of different qualities, and a considerable quan∣tity of excellent fruits, collected from every quarter of the world. There you see extensive pastures covered with horses, black cattle, and sheep—these herds and flocks thrive exceedingly well. The abundance which this colony en∣joys, compared to the barrenness of the surrounding countries, e∣vidently demonstrates that the earth denies her favours only to the tyrant and the slave; but be∣comes prodigal of her treasures, beyond the most sanguine hope, so soon as she is free, and culti∣vated by men of discernment, whom wise and invariable laws protect.</P>
<P>A number of Frenchmen, forced from their country by the revocation of the edict of Nantz, have on this coast found a new establishment, and, with it secu∣rity, property, and liberty, the only true encouragers of agricul∣ture, the only principles of abun∣dance. They have enriched this adopted mother by their industry; they have there founded consider∣able colonies, some of which bear the name of that unhappy coun∣try which denied them the use of water and of fire, the remem∣brance of which however they still fondly cherish.</P>
<P>The colony of the Little Ro∣chelle surpasses all the rest, by the industry of the colonists, and the fertility of the lands which belong to it. The pastures are there composed of a variety of grasses, natives of the country, together with several different species of herbage, which com∣pose our artificial meadows in Europe, such as trefoil, lucerne, and saintfoin. The exotic plants, the seeds of which have been im∣ported by the Dutch, flourish there as the natural productions of the country. Those seeds are sown by an operation of the plough; they cut the grass only the first year; the second they o∣pen the meadows to cattle, which live there at discretion, without any other attention than that of collecting them together every evening into a park inclosed with strong and high pallisades, to se∣cure them against the lions and tigers, with which this country abounds.</P>
<P>Some of these enclosures are watered only by the rains, altho' they generally endeavour to chuse them in the neighbourhood of some brook, where they dig com∣modious watering places. In all these pasturages, they have an eye to groves of trees, where the herds and flocks may find shelter against the intense heat of the sun; particularly in January, February, and March, which in this part of the world are the most sultry months in the year.</P>
<P>The arable land is here labour∣ed as in Europe, sometimes by
<PB N="21" REF="015853_0018_0F9A2E7A4EE86800"/>
horses, but oftener by oxen: the Dutch of this colony have by their industry corrected the natu∣ral sluggishness of these latter a∣nimals, by exercising them while young in a brisk pace; in conse∣quence of which I have seen, at the Cape, carriages, drawn by teams of ten or a dozen yoke of oxen, go as expeditiously as if drawn by horses.</P>
<P>The grains commonly sown at the Cape, are wheat, turkey corn, and rice; these generally produce an increase of fifty-fold. They cultivate a variety of different kinds of pulse, such as pease, common beans, and French beans. This pulse makes a refreshing provision to the ships touching at the Cape going or returning to India.</P>
<P>A particular species of this pulse is much in request in India, to which they export a consider∣able quantity: it is there known by the name of <HI>Cape Pease:</HI> it is a kind of French bean which re∣quires no prop; its grain is of the form of that bean, but larger and flatter; it tastes like our green pease, and preserves its freshness for a long time. I have this year attempted the culture of this plant, which promises success. The cli∣mate at the Cape seems to demand from the cultivator an attention which appears not so necessary in this country, and which would even perhaps be prejudicial to the productions of our lands.</P>
<P>The Cape however is exposed the greatest part of the year to vi∣olent hurricanes, which blow ge∣nerally from the north-east.— These winds are so impetuous that they would beat down the fruits from the trees, and sweep to destruction the labours of the farmer, had they not provided a barrier for the security of the har∣vest. The Dutch colonists have divided their lands into small fields, which they have surround∣ed with high pallisades of oak and other trees, planted very close to one another, somewhat resem∣bling a charmille, designed for the ornament of a garden. These pallisades th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>out every year, as they gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; their height being commonly from twenty-five to thirty feet; every separate field, in consequence, is enclosed like a chamber.</P>
<P>It is by this industry alone that the Dutch have rendered this co∣lony not only the granary of all their settlements in the East-In∣dies, but the most commodious place for vessels to touch at for refreshments and provisions of all kinds.</P>
<P>When the Dutch began to form their vineyards, they endeavoured to procure plants from those can∣tons which enjoyed the greatest reputation for their vines; but after many fruitless attempts to produce, at the extremity of A∣frica, the wines of Burgundy and Champagne, they applied to rear∣ing the plants transported from Spain, the Canaries, and the Le∣vant, where the climate is more analogous to the Cape. At pre∣sent, the plants which are culti∣vated most successfully, are those of the Muscadel kind: the red Muscadel particularly, which they rear in a small district called Con∣stance, produces most delicious wine; the Dutch East-India Com∣pany always secure this vintage, which they send in presents to the sovereigns of Europe.</P>
<P>The wines at the Cape are cul∣tivated without vine-props; the
<PB N="22" REF="015853_0019_0F9A2E7B14E12760"/>
method of labour is much the same with that in France. The vineyards are surrounded by a number of trees, upon which they entwine the slips of the great Spanish Muscadine, in form of espasiers, very high, by which the vines are sheltered from the violence of the winds.</P>
<P>The same attention, at the Cape, is paid to gardening, as to the other branches of agriculture. You there find all the variety of European pulse, greens, herbs, and roots, with the best of those peculiar to other parts of the world. Independent of the gar∣dens of the colonists, which are kept in as fine order as any in Europe, the India Company have cultivated two or three gar∣dens, extensive and magnificent, which they support with an ex∣pence worthy of a sovereign com∣pany.</P>
<P>Fifteen or twenty European gardeners, whose abilities are ap∣proved before they are embarked, are employed in the cultivation of each of those vast gardens, un∣der the direction of a principal gardener, whose place is lucrative and honourable. It is in those gardens, at the expence of the company, that all the experi∣ments are made in every new species of culture; and it is there that every private individual is provided, gratis, with such plants and seeds as he may have occasi∣on for, together with the neces∣sary instructions for their cultiva∣tion. These gardens furnish, in the greatest abundance, herbage and fruits of various kinds to the company's ships.</P>
<P>Travellers cannot but with pleasure and admiration observe large enclosures consecrated to the study and improvement of botany, in which the most rare and useful plants, from every quarter of the world, are arrang∣ed in the most excellent order: the curious have the additional satisfaction also of finding skilful gardeners, who take pleasure in describing and pointing out their virtues.</P>
<P>Those beautiful gardens are terminated by large orchards, where are to be found all the fruits of Europe, together with several natives of Africa and A∣sia. Nothing is more agreeable than to see in different expositi∣ons, even in the same enclosure, the chesnut, the apple, and other trees, from the most northern cli∣mates, together with the musca∣dine of the Indies, the camphres of Borneo, the palms, and a va∣riety of other trees, which are natives of the torrid zone.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of area">
<HEAD>MADAGASCAR.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER doubling the Cape of Good Hope, you enter the Indian sea, where you find the great island of Madagascar: we are still unacquainted with many places of this island, though the Portuguese, Dutch, French, and other Europeans have had settlements, and frequented it, above two centuries. Those parts, which we know, are very fertile, and the inhabitants would, in all probability, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tivate them ex∣tremely well, were there a vent for their productions. They rear numerous herds of cattle and sheep; their pasturages, such as nature has formed them, are rich:
<PB N="23" REF="015853_0020_0F9A2E7C8F99ED50"/>
in many cantons are large tracts of tilled ground, covered with grass of an extraordinary size, which grows to the height of five or six feet; the natives call it <HI>Fatak</HI>; it is excellent for nourishing and fattening their horned cattle, which are of the largest species, and differ in shape from ours, par∣ticularly by a large fleshy protu∣berance on their neck —Another grass, of a finer blade, shoots spontaneously through the sands on the sea coast, which furnishes food for the sheep: these are of the same species with those of Barbary, and differ from ours most remarkably, by the mon∣strous size of their tails, which weigh in general from six to eight pounds.</P>
<P>The Madecasses or Malegaches (which is the name of the inhabi∣tants of this island) cultivate scarce any other grain but rice: they sow at the commencement of the rainy season; in consequence of which they are not under the necessity of watering their fields. In labouring their ground, they use no instrument but the pick∣axe; they begin by grubbing up all the weeds; then five or six men, ranging themselves in a line on the field, dig little holes as they pass along, into which the women or children, who follow, throw the grains of the rice, and then with their feet cover them with earth: a field sown in this manner, produces an increase of above eighty or a hundred-fold, which proves rather the extreme fertility of the soil, than the goodness of the cultivation: bad∣ly understood as it may be, how∣ever, the inhabitants of Mada∣gascar live in abundance. In no country in the world, that I have seen, are rice and other essential provisions cheaper than in this island. For a remnant of coarse blue cloath, which may be worth perhaps twenty pence, the Made∣casse gives two or three measures of rice. These measures are fur∣nished by the Europeans, who never fail to enlarge them every year; yet the islanders do not complain. The measure is first of all heaped; the buyer then, in virtue of an established right for securing good measure, thrusts his arm to the elbow in the rice, and with one sweep empties it al∣most entirely, which the Made∣casse has the patience a second time to replenish, without a mur∣mur. This measure is called a <HI>Gamelle,</HI> which, thus filled, will hold about 160 pounds of pure rice.</P>
<P>There cannot be a doubt, but if our India Company,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French India Company.</NOTE> who a∣lone are in possession of the trade with the natives of this island, would give proper encourage∣ment to agriculture, it would in a short time make a rapid pro∣gress.—Our islands of Bourbon and France would here always find a certain resource against those dearths which too frequent∣ly distress the latter of those islands. Our squadrons bound for India, who put into the isle of France for refreshments, would there always find abundance of provisions brought from Mada∣gascar, and of consequence would not be subjected to the necessity of losing their time at the Cape, or at Batavia, begging refresh∣ments from the Dutch, whilst the
<PB N="24" REF="015853_0021_0F9A2E7DD14222F8"/>
enemies of France, as happened in the late war, are conquering their settlements, and destroying their trade.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Perhaps it may be owing to some hint here given, that the French (as is reported) are now again endeavouring to establish settlements on the Island of Madagascar.</NOTE></P>
<P>Wheat would grow in Mada∣gascar in the same abundance as rice; it was formerly cultivated successfully in the settlement, which we then possessed at the southern point of the island, cal∣led Fort Dauphin. Even at this day fine stalks of wheat are still to be found there, produced from the scattered grains of the ancient crops, which, being blown about by the winds, have annually, since our being drove from that settlement, sown of themselves, and sprung up at random, a∣mongst the native herbs of the country. The lands there are of inconceivable fertility; the islan∣ders intelligent and ingenious. In those districts where the Arabs have not penetrated, the simple laws of nature are their guides; their manners the manners of the primitive ages. These laws, and these manners, are more favour∣able for agriculture, than all our sublime speculations, than all our most applauded theories on the most approved practice; than all those ineffectual means now em∣ployed to re-animate an art, which our manners teach us to regard with contempt, or treat with levity; and which is perpe∣tually harrassed, perpetually op∣pressed by innumerable abuses, which derive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir source from the very laws th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>selves.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>ISLE</HI> of <HI>BOURBON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALMOST 200 leagues east of Madagascar, lie the two islands of Bourbon and France; the soil of which is naturally as fertile as that of Madagascar, whilst they enjoy a happier cli∣mate. Bourbon has no port; it is of consequence little frequent∣ed by the shipping. The inha∣bitants have preserved their sim∣plicity of manners, and agricul∣ture is there in a flourishing state. The island produces wheat, rice, and maize, not only for its own consumpt, but even furnishes a small supply to the Isle of France: the culture there is the same as at Madagascar. The horned cattle and sheep, which they have im∣ported from that island, thrive here extremely well, especially as they have also introduced the grass called <HI>Fatak,</HI> which, as I have before observed, makes ex∣cellent pasturage.</P>
<P>The lands of this island are principally employed in the cul∣ture of the coffee-tree. The first plants of this shrubby tree were brought from Mocha. It multi∣plies by its grains sowing sponta∣neously; little attention is re∣quired; nothing more is necessa∣ry than to grub up, three or four times during the first year, the neighbouring weeds, which would otherwise rob it of its proper nou∣rishment: the second year it grows without care; its branches, which extend horizontally along the surface of the ground, by their shade stifle the growth of
<PB N="25" REF="015853_0022_0F9A2E7E1193A240"/>
all such weeds, as might shoot up within their circumference: at the end of eighteen months the coffee-tree begins to bear fruit, and in three years yields a plen∣tiful crop. They plant these trees chequer-wise, at about the distance of seven feet from one another, and, when they grow too tall, prune them to the height of perhaps two feet from the ground.</P>
<P>The coffee-tree demands a light foil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it thrives better in sand al∣most pure, than in rich ground: they observe in the isle of Bour∣bon, that these trees yield annu∣ally, one with another about a pound of coffee: this fruit comes to perfection, and is gathered in during dry weather, which gives it a great advantage over the West India coffee, which never ripens nor is got in but in the rainy seasons. The coffee, after it is gathered in, must be dried; for several days, therefore, it is exposed to the sun, till the bean becomes extremely dry; they then clear it of the pulp, which is done by pestles in large wooden troughs.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>ISLE</HI> of <HI>FRANCE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS island possesses two excellent harbours, where all the shipping of the French Company, employed in the com∣merce of China and the Indies, touch for refreshments: here also rendezvous their armaments in times of war: this island is, of consequence, not so solitary as Bourbon. The politics and man∣ners of Europe have here more influence. The lands are as fer∣tile as those of Bourbon; rivu∣lets, which are never dry, water it like a garden: notwithstand∣ing which the harvests often fail, and scarcity is here almost per∣petually felt.</P>
<P>Since the days of the celebrated M. de la Bourdo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nois (who go∣verned this island for ten or twelve years, and ought to be regarded as the founder of the colony, for his introduction and patronage of agriculture) they have wandered incessantly from project to project, attempting the culture of almost every species of plants, without properly prose∣cuting any one of them. The coffee, the cotton, the indigo, the sugar cane, the pear, the cinnamon, the mulberry, the tea, and the cocoa trees have all been cultivated by experiments, but in such a superficial manner as could never secure success. Had they followed the simple plan of the founder, which was to secure bread, the island would at this day have been flourishing; Abundance would then have reigned amongst the colonists, and the shipping never been dis∣appointed of the necessary re∣freshments and provisions.</P>
<P>The cultivation of grain, ne∣vertheless, though neglected and badly understood, is that which succeeds the best. Those lands, which are so employed, yield an∣nually a crop of wheat, and ano∣ther of rice or Turkey corn, without the intervention of one follow year, and without the least improvement, or any other mode
<PB N="26" REF="015853_0023_0F9A2E7EF100A5B0"/>
of labour, than that which is practised at Madagascar.</P>
<P>The <HI>Manaic</HI> was first introduced into this island by M. de la Bour∣donnois: the culture of this plant was at first attended with very great difficulty, but it is now the principal resource of the colonists for the nourishment of their slaves. As the culture of this root is here the same as in Ame∣rica, I shall not repeat what has been related by a number of tra∣vellers.</P>
<P>They formerly brought from Madagascar, black cattle and sheep; but since they have disco∣vered that more advantage at∣tends the transportation of slaves, they have neglected the increase of their cattle, which the conti∣nual demands of the shipping, and the wants of the inhabitants at the same time, daily diminish: besides, they have never hitherto formed any pastures; such as they have attempted having been laid out with so little skill, that they have not succeeded. The island produces naturally, in dif∣ferent cantons, an excellent kind of grass, which grows to the height of five or six feet. This grass begins to appear above ground about the beginning of the rainy season; it performs all its vegetation during the three months, which this season lasts: the inhabitants take advantage of this to pasture their herds, who fatten upon it amazingly; but, the vegetation over, there remains nothing on the ground but a straw too hard to afford nourish∣ment to the cattle; and, soon after, the fire, which is kindled here by a thousand accidents, consumes this straw, and with it frequently part of the neighbour∣ing forests. During the remain∣der of the year, the herds wander about and languish amongst the woods.</P>
<P>The greatest fault which has been committed in this island, and which has proved most pre∣judicial to cultivation, is the method of clearing the woods from off the ground by fire, without leaving groves and thick∣ets at proper distances. The rains, in this island, conduce most to the amelioration of the grounds; but the clouds being stopt by the forests, there the rains fall; whilst the cleared lands are scarce watered by a sin∣gle drop: the fields, at the same time, being thus deprived of de∣fence, are exposed to the violence of the winds, which often entire∣ly destroy the harvests.—The Dutch, as we have before obser∣ved, found no trees at the Cape; but they have planted them there as shelter for their habitations. The isle of France, on the con∣trary, was covered with woods, and the colonists have entirely destroyed them.</P>

<P>AGRICULTURE has ever flourished in the East In∣dies; it has, however, degene∣rated since the conquest of this country by the Moguls; who, like all barbarous nations, have despised that industry which nou∣rishes mankind, to attach them∣selves
<PB N="27" REF="015853_0024_0F9A2E7F8FAD9C60"/>
to that destructive art, which desolates the earth.</P>
<P>The conquerors, when they took possession of the country appropriated to themselves at the same time all the lands. The Mogul emperors divided them into great moveable fiefs, which they distributed amongst their grandees; these farmed them out to their vassals; and those again to others; so that the lands are now no longer cultivated but by the servants and day-labourers of the sub-farmers.</P>
<P>As no country in the world is more exposed to revolution than the Indies, subjected to masters whose government is an absolute anarchy, the possessor of the fief, as well as the farmer, for ever uncertain of their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te, endeavour to make the most of the lands and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir cultivators without e∣ver bestowing a thought on im∣provement. Fortunately for these barbarian conquerors, the con∣quered natives, inviolably at∣tached to their ancient manners, apply themselves incessantly to a∣griculture, from inclination, and from religion. Notwithstanding the frantic despotism of the Mo∣gul government, the Malabar,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The French give the name of Malabar, not only to the ancient in∣habitants of the Malabar coast, but in general to the Aborigines of the great peninsula of Indostan.</NOTE> despising and pitying the master whom he obeys, cultivates, with the same ardor as if he was pro∣prietor, the fields of his ances∣tors, the care of which is confid∣ed to him by the usurper.</P>
<P>The labourers are a tribe much honoured among the Indians. Religion has consecrated agricul∣ture, even to the animals destine for the labour of the ground. As the Indies in general are defi∣cient in pastures, as horses are scarce, as buffaloes and other cat∣tle for the draught multiply but slowly, the ancient Indian policy made it a crime against their re∣ligion to kill these useful ani∣mals — The Malabars make them more serviceable than any other people: they employ them as we do, in labouring the ground; as also in drawing their carriages, and in carrying every kind of load; there are no other beasts of burden in the neighbourhood of Pondicherry. I am convinced that in every country they might be rendered equally useful.</P>
<P>The soil on the Coromandel to it is light, dry, and sandye the industry and labour however, of the natives, make it produce two crops every year, without the necessity of one fallow season. After the rice harvest is over, there is always a crop of some smaller grains, such as millet, and a species of French beans, of which India produces a variety of different kinds</P>
<P>The most remarkable process of Indian husbandry, is the water∣ing their grounds for the culture of rice.</P>

Every thing being thus disposed, a man ascends to the top of the column, by the ladder fixed to the see-saw: as soon as he has reached the top, another man, stationed by the side of the reservoir, plunges the bucket, which is sus∣pended by the pole, into the well; upon which he at the top descends the ladder, and bringing thereby the bucket full of water to a level with the reservoir, the other there empties it. As soon as the reservoir is full, they open a kind of sluice; the inundation begins, and is kept constantly flowing by the operations of these two men, who sometimes are thus employed whole days, the one ascending and descending, the other throwing the bucket into the well, and emptying it when full.</P>

<P>THE Malabars labour their grounds with instruments resembling the Aire and the Souchée, in use in the south of France.

<HEAD>GARDENS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Malabar gardens there is no kind of pulse equal to ours. Exclusive of the various kinds of French-bean, some of which are of the arborescent kind; the best they cultivate is the <HI>Ba∣zella,</HI> known in France by the name of <HI>Spinage of China:</HI> this is a lively, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bering plant, which, while growing, they support up on sticks, like our p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase, or prop up against the walls, which it very soon covers with a most a∣greeable verdure; its taste is al∣most the same with our spinage.</P>
<P>Gardening is but little known on the Coromandel coast. The orchards are better supplied than the gardens; yet they have no fruits that can be compared to those of Europe. They do not understand the art of engrafting. Their most common fruits are the pine apple, the mango, the bo∣nana, and the gouyave.

</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of tree">
<HEAD>The <HI>COCOA-TREE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE most useful of all the trees in their orchards is undoub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edly the cocoa-tree.— This tree bears clusters of nuts of an immense size. When these nuts are r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe, they yield a spe∣cies of oil in great abundance, which the Indians use for various purposes, particularly in season∣ing their garden stuff; the taste of this oil, however is extremely disagreeable to those who are not accustomed to eat it. But the method of rendering the culture of this tree most advantageous, is the extracting wine from its fruit. The Indian watches the time when the nuts of the cocoa tree
<PB N="30" REF="015853_0027_0F9A2E81CEFBFBB8"/>
have attained to the size of our ordinary nuts, which happens soon after the fall of the flower: he then makes an incision in the stalk of the cluster about seven or eight inches from the trunk of the tree; here he fastens an earthen vessel to receive the juice, which issues in great abundance: the mouth of the vessel he carefully wraps round with a cloth, to pre∣vent the admission of the air, which would soon turn it to the fret. The vessel fills in twenty-four hours: the Indian takes care to change it every day. This natural wine, which is called <HI>Soury,</HI> is sold and drunk in this state. It has much of the taste and strength of the <HI>Must,</HI> or new wine of the grape: it keeps, how∣ever, but a few days; it is neces∣sary then to distil it, otherwise it would sour, and become entirely useless. This species of wine, when distilled, is the well-known liquor called <HI>Arack.</HI></P>
<P>A cocoa-tree, thus managed, is worth a pagoda (about eight shillings) per annum. These trees are planted about twenty five or thirty feet distant from each other. They produce no∣thing for ten or twelve years, but then annually bear fruit for above fifty years. They flourish best in a mixed sandy soil; and suc∣ceed extremely well even in pure sand.</P>
<P>The Malabars cultivate, in the open fields, a variety of plants, whose productions are of an oily substance, such as the <HI>Sesame</HI> or <HI>Gergelin,</HI> which is a kind of fox-grass, and the <HI>Ricen</HI> or <HI>Palma Christi.</HI> The fresh oil extracted from this plant, which is known in Europe for a violent and dan∣gerous caustic, cannot have the same hurtful quality in the In∣dies, as the Malabars consider it as a gentle purgative, and the best remedy for almost all the di∣seases incident to infants at the breast; giving them usually, e∣very month, a spoon-ful of it, mixed in an equal quantity of their mother's milk.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this article by observing, that the reader must not form an idea of agriculture over the Indies in general, from the sketch I have given of that on the Coromandel coast: this coast, and the countries adjacent, form but a small part of the East-Indies, properly so called: they are, at the same time, the most barren, and have suffered most from the devastations of the Moguls, from the destructive government of these conquerors, and from the continual wars which harrass and depopulate the country. The coasts of Orixa, Malabar, the territory of Surat, the banks of the Ganges, and the interior parts of Indostan, are much more fertile, and in many of these countries agriculture flourishes surprisingly. I relate nothing but facts, which I had opportuni∣ties of observing myself.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>KINGDOM</HI> of <HI>SIAM.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE kingdom of Siam, si∣tuate on the peninsula of the Indies beyond the Ganges, is in general extremely fertile.— Divided, like Indostan, by a chain of mountains from north to south, it enjoys, all the year round, and at the same time, two very opposite seasons. The wes∣tern division, all along the bay of Bengal, is deluged by continual rains, during the six months that the monsoons continue to blow from the west. This season is considered as their winter on this coast; whilst in the other division of the kingdom, towards the east, they enjoy the finest climate, and never experience that difference of season, which reigns on the western side, except by the over∣flowing of the Menam. This noble river runs along a great way among mountains, where the rains concenter: it washes the walls of the capital, and annu∣ally overflows, without the least ravage, a delightful country, co∣vered all over with rich plantati∣ons. The slime, which the Me∣nam leaves behind, enriches the soil prodigiously; the rice seems to grow up in proportion as the inundation rises, and the river at length gently retires by degrees into its bed, as the rice approach∣es to maturity, and has no further occasion for its waters. How bountiful has nature been to those who inhabit this charming coun∣try!—she has, however, done more: the fields produce, in pro∣fusion, an infinite variety of most delicate fruits, which require al∣most no cultivation; such as the pine apple, the mangoustas, (the most delicate fruit perhaps in the world) mangoes of different kinds and all excellent, several species of oranges, the banana, the du∣cion, the gacca, with other fruits of inferior quality. Nature, still more bountiful, has also scattered over this country, almost on the surface of the ground, mines of gold, copper, and a species of fine tin, which there, as in other parts of India, they name <HI>Calin.</HI></P>
<P>In this terrestrial paradise, sur∣rounded with so much riches, who would imagine that the Si∣amese are, perhaps, the most wretched people in the world?</P>
<P>The government of Siam is de∣spotic: the sovereign alone en∣joys that liberty which is natural to all mankind: his subjects are all his slaves; every one of them is annually taxed at six months personal service without wages, and even without food: he al∣lows them the other six months to procure themselves wherewithal to exist the year. Under such a government, there is no law that can afford protection to individu∣als against violence, or in the smallest degree secure them in their property. Every thing is subjected to the caprice of a prince, rendered brutal by every species of excess, particularly that of power; who passes his days locked up in his seraglio, with∣out an idea of any thing beyond the walls of his palace, and par∣ticularly ignorant of the wretched condition of his subjects. These are exposed to the avarice of the grandees, who themselves are only
<PB N="32" REF="015853_0029_0F9A2E834F11B250"/>
the chief slaves, and tremblingly approach, on appointed days, the presence of their tyrant, whom they adore like a divinity, though subject to the most dangerous caprices.</P>
<P>Religion alone has preserved the power of protecting against tyranny those who, ranging them∣selves under its standard, are ad∣mitted into the order of the priests of <HI>Somonacondom,</HI> the deity of the Siamese. Those who embrace this order, and their number is considerable, are by law obliged to observe the strictest celibacy which, in a warm climate, such as that of Siam, whilst it occasi∣ons great disorders, almost depo∣pulates the country.</P>
<P>It may easily be conceived, that under such a government agri∣culture cannot flourish; it may be said, even, that no regard is paid to it at all, when the small por∣tion of ground which is laboured, is compared to the immense ex∣tent of lands which are totally neglected.</P>
<P>With regard even to those grounds which they have laid out, nature may be said to do e∣very thing. Men oppressed, de∣based, without spirit, nay, in a manner without hands, give them∣selves scarce any other trouble than just to reap what the earth produces; and, as the country is extensive, and thinly peopl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, they enjoy abundance of necessa∣ries, almost without labour.</P>
<P>From the port of Mergin, situ∣ated on the western coast of this kingdom, to the capital, during a journey of ten or twelve days, you cross immense plains, charm∣ingly watered, and the soil excel∣lent; some of which appear to have been formerly tilled, but now lie quite uncultivated. This journey <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ravellers are under the necessi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of making in caravans, in order to defend themselves from the tygers and the elephants, to which this fine country is in a manner entirely abandoned, dur∣ing a journey of eight days there scarce being the vestige of a ha∣bitation.</P>
<P>The environs of the capital are cultivated; the lands belonging to the king, those of the princes, the ministers, and principal offi∣cers display the amazing fertility of the country, producing, as I have been assured, an increase of two hundred-fold.</P>
<P>The Siamese method of culti∣vating their rice, is first to sow it very thick in a small square plot of ground, well watered, a little below the surface of the earth. As soon as the plants have grown about five or six inches high, they pull them up, by the roots, and transplant them in small parcels of three or four stalks, distant from each other about four inches every way. These plants are placed deep in a clay soil, which has been previously well laboured with a plow, dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn by two buf∣faloes. The rice, transplanted in this manner▪ has beyond compa∣rison a much greater increase, than if allowed to grow up in the same ground where it was origin∣ally planted.</P>
<P>It is the Chinese, and the Co∣chinchinese, settled in the capi∣tal and its neighbourhood, who contribute most to the improve∣ment of the grounds. These strangers are useful to the sove∣reign, by the commerce they car∣ry on with him, and it is the in∣terest of the government to protect them from oppression.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="015853_0030_0F9A2E840F343E10"/>In the neighbourhood of the uncultivated lands I have menti∣oned, you find others, belonging to different individuals, who, discouraged by continual oppres∣sions, have quite abandoned them. It is astonishing, however, to ob∣serve these lands, frequently nei∣ther laboured nor sown for years together, produce extraordinary crops of rice. The grain, reaped negligently, sows of itself, and re-produces annually another har∣vest, by the help of the inunda∣tions of the river Menam; which proves, at the same time, the extreme fertility of the ground, and the extreme misery of the in∣habitants.</P>
<P>The orchards of the prince, and the great Talapoins,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A religious order.</NOTE> are ad∣mirable for the variety of their fruits, all of the most exquisite kind; but these delicacies no private individual is allowed to enjoy. When a man is so unhap∣py as to have in his grounds a tree of excellent fruit such as the mangoustas, a party of soldiers never fail to come every year, to secure, for the king, or some great minister, the produce of this tree. They take an account of every mangousta, good or bad, making the proprietor guardian and security for the whole; and, when the fruits ripen, should there happen the smallest defici∣ency, the poor proprietor is sub∣jected to all the insolence of un∣restrained power; it becomes, of consequence, a real misfortune for a private man to be possessed of such a tree.</P>
<P>The Siamese rear herds of buf∣faloes, and horned cattle; but all the care they take of them is, to conduct them, in the day time, to the fallow grounds, which a∣bound in pastures, and re conduct them, in the evening, to the in∣closures, in order to secure them from the tygers, of which there are great numbers in this coun∣try. The milk, and a very little labour, is all the advantages they draw from them. Their religi∣on, which is the same that pre∣vails in Indostan, and which the Talapoins alone know any thing about, forbids them killing these animals. They elude, however, this law, by selling them to the Mahometans settled among them, who kill them, and sell their flesh privately. They have also great numbers of poultry, particularly ducks, of the best kinds in the Indies.</P>
<P>The king maintains a number of tame elephants. Each of these monstrous animals has twelve or fifteen men daily employed in cut∣ting herbs, bananiers, (a kind of large rose) and sugar canes.— They are after all of no real use; they serve only for shew. They display, say the Siamese, the grandeur of their prince; and be conceives an idea of his greatness, more from the number of his ele∣phants, than from the number of his subjects.</P>
<P>These animals, wherever they come, make most destructive ha∣vock; of this their keepers take advantage, making every indivi∣dual, who is possessed of cultiva∣ted lands, or gardens, pay annu∣ally a certain tribute: should they refuse, the elephants would immediately be let loose, and ra∣vage and ruin desolate their fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lds: for what subject would be hardy

enough to dare to fail in respect to the elephants of the king of Siam, many of which, to the dis∣grace of humanity, are loaded with a profusion of titles, and preferred to the first dignities in the kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>MALAIS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEYOND the kingdom of Siam is the peninsula of Malacca; a country formerly well peopled, and, consequently, well cultivated. This nation was once one of the greatest powers, and made a very considerable figure on the theatre of Asia. The sea was covered with their ships, and they carried on a most extensive commerce. Their laws, howe∣ver, were apparently very differ∣ent from those which subsist a∣mong them at present. From time to time they sent out num∣bers of colonies, which, one af∣ter another, peopled the islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, the Celebes or Macassor, the Moluc∣cas, the Philippines, and those innumerable islands of the Archi∣pelago, which bound Asia on the east, and which occupy an extent of seven hundred leagues, in lon∣gitude, from east to west, by a∣bout six hundred of latitude, from north to south. The inhabitants of all these islands, those at least upon the coast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, are the same people; they speak almost the same language, have the same laws, the same manners —Is it not somewhat singular, that this nation, whose possessions are so extensive, should scarce be known in Europe?—I shall endeavour to give you an idea of those laws, and those manners; you will, from thence, easily judge of their agriculture.</P>
<P>Travellers, who make observ∣ations on the Malais, are asto∣nished to find, in the center of Asia, under the scorching climate of the line, the laws, the man∣ners, the customs, and the pre∣judices of the ancient inhabitants of the north of Europe. The Malais are governed by feudal laws, that capricious system, con∣ceived for the defence of the li∣berty of a few against the tyranny of one, whilst the multitude is subjected to slavery and oppres∣sion.</P>
<P>A chief, who has the title of king, or sultan, issues his com∣mands to his great vassals, who obey when they think proper.— These have inferior vassals, who often act in the same manner with regard to them. A small part of the nation live indepen∣dent, under the title of <HI>Oramcai,</HI> or <HI>noble,</HI> and sell their services to those who pay them best; whilst the body of the nation is compos∣ed of slaves, and live in perpetual servitude.</P>
<P>With these laws the Malais are restless, fond of navigation, war, plunder, emigrations, colonies, desperate enterprizes, adventures, and gallantry. They talk inces∣santly of their honour, and their bravery, whilst they are univer∣sally considered, by those with whom they have intercourse, as the most treacherous, ferocious people on the face of the globe;
<PB N="35" REF="015853_0032_0F9A2E8590D40F48"/>
and yet, which appeared to me extremely singular, they speak the softest language of Asia — That which the Count de Forbin has said, in his memoirs, of the ferocity of the Macassars, is ex∣actly true, and is the reigning characteristic of the whole Malay nations. More attached to the absurd laws of their pretended honour, than to those of justice or humanity, you always observe, that amongst them, the strong oppress and destroy the weak: their treaties of peace and friend∣ship never subsisting beyond that self interest which induced them to make them, they are almost always armed, and either at war amongst themselves, or employed in pillaging their neighbours.</P>
<P>This ferocity, which the Ma∣lais qualify under the name of courage, is so well known to the European companies, who have settlements in the Indies, that they have universally agreed in prohibiting the captains of their ships, who may put into the Ma∣lay islands, from taking on board any seamen of that nation, except in the greatest distress, and then, on no account, to exceed two or three.</P>
<P>It is nothing uncommon for a handful of these horrid savages suddenly to embark, attack a vessel by surprize, poignard in hand, massacre the people, and make themselves masters of her. Malay batteaus, with twenty-five or thirty men, have been known to board European ships of thirty or forty guns, in order to take possession of them, and murder, with their poignards, great part of the crew The Malay history is full of such enterprizes which mark the desperate ferocity of these barbarians.</P>
<P>The Malais, who are not slaves, go always armed: they would think themselves disgraced, if they went abroad without their poignards, which they call <HI>Crit.</HI> The industry of this nation even surpasses itself, in the fabrick of this destructive weapon.</P>
<P>As their lives are a perpetual round of agitation and tumult, they could never endure the long flowing habits, which prevail a∣mong the other Asiatics. The habits of the Malais are exactly adapted to their shapes, and loa∣ded with a number of buttons, which fasten them close to their bodies in every part.—I relate these seemingly trifling observati∣ons, in order to prove, that, in climates the most opposite, the same laws produce similar man∣ners, customs and prejudices — Their effect is the same too with respect to agriculture.</P>
<P>The lands possessed by the Malais are, in general, of a supe∣rior quality. Nature seems to have taken pleasure in there as∣sembling her most favourite pro∣ductions. They have not only those to be found in the territo∣ries of Siam, but a variety of o∣thers peculiar to these islands.— The country is covered with o∣doriferous woods, such as the ea∣gle or aloes wood, the sandal, and the cassia odorata, a species of cinnamon. You there breathe an air impregnated with the odours of innumerable flowers of the greatest fragrance, of which there is a perpetual succession the year round, the sweet flavour of which captivates the soul, and inspires the most voluptuous sensations. No traveller, wandering over the plains of Malacca, but feels him∣self strongly impelled to wish his

residence fixed in a place so luxu∣riant in allurements, where na∣ture triumphs without the assist∣ance of art.</P>
<P>The Malay islands produce va∣rious kinds of dying woods, par∣ticularly the <HI>Sapan,</HI> which is the same with the Brasil wood. There are also a number of gold mines, which the inhabitants of Sumatra and Malacca call <HI>Ophirs:</HI> some of which, those especially on the eastern coast, are richer than those of Brasil or Peru. There are likewise mines of fine copper, mixed with gold, which the in∣habitants name <HI>Tombage.</HI> In the islands of Sumatra and Banea are mines of calin, or fine tin; and at Succadana, in the island of Borneo, is a mine of diamonds. Those islands enjoy also, exclu∣sively, the rotin, the sagou, (or bread palm-tree) the camphre, and other precious aromatics, which we know under the names of various spiceries.</P>
<P>The sea too teems with abun∣dance of excellent fish, together with ambergris, pearls, and those delicate birds nests (so much in request in China) formed in the rocks with the spawn of fishes, and the foam of the sea, by a species of small-sized swallow, peculiar to those seas: this is of such an exquisite substance and flavour, that the Chinese long purchased them for their weight in gold, and still buy them at an excessive price.</P>
<P>In the midst of all this luxuri∣ance of nature, the Malay is mi∣serable. The culture of the lands, abandoned to slaves, is fallen in∣to contempt These wretched labourers, dragged incessantly from their rustic employments, by their restless masters, who delight in war and maritime enterprizes, have rarely time, and never reso∣lution, to give the necessary at∣tention to the labouring of their grounds. Their lands, in gene∣ral, remain uncultivated; and produce no kind of grain for the subsistence of the inhabitants.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of tree">
<HEAD>SAGOU.</HEAD>
<P>THE sagou tree, in part, supplies the defect of grain. This admirable tree is a present which bountiful nature has made to men incapable of labour. It requires no culture; it is a spe∣cies of the palm-tree, which grows naturally, in the woods, to the height of about twenty or thirty feet; its circumference being sometimes from five to six. Its ligneous bark is about an inch in thickness, and covers a multitude of long fibres, which, being in∣terwoven one with another, enve∣lope a mass of a gummy kind of meal. As soon as this tree is ripe, a whitish dust, which tran∣spires through the pores of the leaves, and adheres to their ex∣tremities, proclaims its maturity. The Malais then cut them down near the root, divide them into several sections, which they split into quarters: They then scoop out the mass of mealy substance, which is enveloped by and ad∣heres to the fibres; they dilute it in pure water, and then pass it through a straining bag of fine
<PB N="37" REF="015853_0034_0F9A2E870EE581D0"/>
cloth, in order to separate it from the fibres. When this paste has lost part of its moisture by eva∣poration, the Malais throw it in∣to a kind of earthen vessels, of different shapes, where they allow it to dry and harden. This paste is wholesome nourishing food, and preserves for many years.</P>
<P>The Indians, in general, when they eat the sagou, use no other preparation than diluting it in water; but sometimes they dress it after different manners: they have the art of separating the fin∣est of the flower, and reducing it to little grains, somewhat resem∣bling grains of rice. The sagou, thus prepared, is preferred to the other, for the aged and infirm; and is an excellent remedy for many complaints in the stomach. When diluted, either in cold or boiling water, it forms a whitish jelly, very agreeable to the taste.</P>
<P>Though this sagou-bearing-palm grows naturally in the fo∣rests, the Malay chiefs have formed considerable plantations of it, which constitute one of their principal resources for subsistence.</P>
<P>They might have the finest or∣chards in the world, would they give themselves the trouble to col∣lect the various plants of those ex∣cellent fruits which nature has so liberally bestowed upon them: we find, however, none but a few straggling trees planted at ran∣dom around their houses, or dis∣persed over their lands without symmetry or order.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the great island of Java have somewhat better ideas of agriculture, than the other Malais, since their sub∣jection to the government of the Dutch. These sovereign mer∣chants have taken advantage of the feudal system of the Malais, to reduce them under their yoke; artfully weakening the regal pow∣er, by fomenting, at times, the rebellions of the great vassals; and humbling the vassals in their turn, by succouring their princes, when drove to the brink of ruin.</P>
<P>The Javanese begin to recover from that state of anarchy, the consequence of their ancient laws now almost no longer remember∣ed. They cultivate, with success, rice, coffee, indigo, and sugar∣cane. They rear, on the eastern coast of the island, and in the districts of Madur and Solor, in the neighbourhood, numerous herds of buffaloes, of a monstrous size; their flesh is excellent, and they are of infinite use in labour∣ing the ground. They have likewise numbers of horned cattle, the largest and finest, perhaps, in the world▪ The common pastur∣age in this, and the rest of the Malay islands, is the same grass I have mentioned under the arti∣cle of the isle of France, which the colonists there almost entirely neglect.</P>
<P>Here it would be proper to de∣scribe the manner of cultivating the spiceries, the indigo, the su∣gar-cane, and the camphre; but these must be the subject of ano∣ther discourse. I could have wished also to have comprehend∣ed, in this memoir, the observa∣tions I have made on the husban∣dry of China. You could then have compared nation against na∣tion; and, after having observed agriculture despised and debased amongst barbarians, oppressed and loaded with fetters by their frantic laws, the genuine productions of delirium incompatible with rea∣son, you would have beheld this

This comparative repre∣sentation, whilst on the one hand, it displayed the misery and misfortunes of every kind, which attend the neglect of agriculture, would, on the other, have de∣monstrated how much this art, honoured, protected, and encou∣raged as it ought, will ever ad∣vance the happiness of the human race.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>I Last year began to give you a sketch of my inquiries into the state of agriculture among differ∣ent nations of Africa and Asia. I observed, that scarce a vestige of it could be traced amongst the stupid, the indolent negroes, who inhabit the western coast of Afri∣ca; whilst it flourished, under the shade of liberty, amongst the Holanders at the Cape of Good Hope. I pointed out the happy abundance which reigned in the fertile island of Madagascar, in∣habited by a people governed by the greatest simplicity of manners, and unacquainted with other laws than those of nature. Whilst I did justice also to the system of cultivation that prevailed at the isle of Bourbon, which, having no port, and of consequence little or no intercourse with Europe, the colonists have preserved an uncorrupted system of manners, ever favourable for agriculture, I was at the same time, under the necessity of acknowledging, that this art, which requires persever∣ance and simplicity, was greatly
<PB N="39" REF="015853_0036_0F9A2FB24F4CDEC0"/>
neglected at the isle of France, which, having two excellent ports, and being much frequented by European ships, was more influ∣enced by the inconstant and vola∣tile manners of our quarter of the world; and that, in consequence, though the soil, in point of ferti∣lity, was equal to Madagascar and Bourbon; their harvest ge∣nerally failed, and an almost per∣petual scarcity prevailed over the island.—I passed from thence to the great peninsula of the Indies, where agriculture, however op∣pressed by the barbarous laws of the Mogul conquerors, is still honoured and supported by the religion, the manners, and the perseverance of the conquered Malabars.—At Siam, under the happiest climate, and blessed with a soil inferior in fertility to no country in the world, agriculture we have observed debased by the indignities of tyranny, and aban∣doned by a race of slaves, whom nothing can interest, after the loss of liberty.—I have represented it almost in the same condition a∣mongst the Malais, who inhabit immense dominions, and innu∣merable islands, where nature has distributed her choicest trea∣sures, and lavished her bounties with a profusion unknown to o∣ther regions. The destructive genius of the feudal laws, which keep this people in a perpetual ferment, permits not their appli∣cation to the culture of the finest soil in the world. Nature alone does all. I am convinced, that if the other nations of the earth, who have the misfortune to be govern∣ed by the feudal system, inhabit∣ed a climate equally happy, and lands equally fertile with those of the Malais, their agriculture would be equally neglected: necessity alone could force the plough into their hands.</P>
<P>In my last discourse I endea∣voured to give you an idea of the most interesting modes of local a∣griculture which came under my observation: my principal object, however, was to enable you to remark, that in every country, in every quarter of the world, the state of agriculture depends en∣tirely on the established laws, and, consequently, on the manners, customs, and prejudices from which these laws derived their origin. I now proceed.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>POWER</HI> of <HI>AGRICULTURE.</HI> Origin of the Kingdom of Ponthiamas.</HEAD>
<P>DEPARTING from the pe∣ninsula of Malacca, and the islands of the Malais, towards the north, I fell in with a small ter∣ritory called <HI>Cancar,</HI> but known, on the marine charts, under the name of <HI>Ponthiamas.</HI> Surrounded by the kingdom of Siam, where despotism and depopulation go hand in hand; the dominions of Camboya, where no idea of esta∣blished government subsists; and the territories of the Malais, whose genius, perpetually agitated by their feudal laws, can endure peace neither at home nor abroad: This charming country, about fifty years ago, was uncultivated,
<PB N="40" REF="015853_0037_0F9A2FB310C073C0"/>
and almost destitute of inhabi∣tants.</P>
<P>A chinese merchant, comman∣der of a vessel which he employed in commerce, frequented these coasts. Being a man of that in∣telligent reflective genius, which so characteristically marks his na∣tion, he could not, without pain, behold immense tracts of ground condemned to sterility, though naturally more fertile than those which formed the riches of his own country: he formed, there∣fore, a plan for their improve∣ment. With this view, having first of all hired a number of la∣bourers, some Chinese, others from the neigbouring nations, he, with great address, insinuated himself into the favour of the most powerful princes, who, for a certain subsidy, assigned him a guard for his protection.</P>
<P>In the course of his voyage to Batavia, and the Philippine I∣slands, he borrowed from the Eu∣ropeans their improvements, par∣ticularly the art of fortification and defence; with regard to in∣ternal police, he gave the prefer∣ence to the Chinese. The profits of his commerce soon enabled him to raise ramparts, sink ditches, and provide artillery. These pre∣liminary precautions secured him from a coup de main, and pro∣tected him from the enterprizes of the surrounding nations of bar∣barians.</P>
<P>He distributed the lands to his labourers, without the least reser∣vation of any of those duties or taxes known by the names of ser∣vice or fines of alienation; duties, which by allowing no real pro∣perty, become the most fatal scourge to agriculture, and is an idea which revolts against the common sense of every wise na∣tion. He provided his colonists, at the same time, with all sorts of instruments proper for the la∣bour and improvement of their grounds.</P>
<P>In forming a labouring and commercial people, he thought, that no laws ought to be framed, but those which nature has esta∣blished for the human race in e∣very climate: he made these laws respected by obeying them first himself, and exhibiting an exam∣ple of simplicity, industry, fruga∣lity, humanity, and good faith: —he formed, then, no system of laws—he did more—he establish∣ed morals.</P>
<P>His territories soon became the country of every industrious man, who wished to settle there. The woods were cleared; the grounds judiciously labo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, and sown with rice; canals, cut from the rivers, watered their fields; and plentiful harvests, after supplying them with subsistence, furnished an object of commerce.</P>
<P>The barbarians of the neigh∣bourhood, amazed to see abun∣dance so suddenly succeed to ste∣rility, flocked for subsistence to the magazines of Ponthiamas; whose dominions, at this day, are considered as the most plentiful granary of that eastern party of Asia; the Malais, the Cochin-chinese, the Siamese, whose coun∣tries are naturally so fertile, con∣sidering this little territory as the most certain resource against fa∣mine.</P>
<P>Had the Chinese founder of this colony of mercantile labour∣ers, in imitation of the sovereigns of Asia, established arbitrary im∣posts; if by the introduction of a feudal system, of which he had
<PB N="41" REF="015853_0038_0F9A2FB3D3EA9A30"/>
examples amongst the neighbour∣ing nations, he had vested in him∣self the sole property of the lands, under the specious pretence of giving them away to his colonists; if he had made luxury reign in his palace, in place of that sim∣plicity which distinguished his humble dwelling; had he placed his ambition in a brilliant court, and crowds of sawning slaves; had he preferred the agreeable to the useful arts, despising the industri∣ous, who labour the ground with the sweat of their brow, and pro∣vide sustenance for themselves and their fellow-creatures; had he treated his associates as slaves; had he received into his port strangers in any other shape than as friends; his fields had still been barren, his dominions un peopled; and the wretched inha∣bitants must have died of hunger, notwithstanding all the assistance they could derive from the most useful instruments either for till∣ing or sowing their grounds.— But the sage Kiang-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, (the name of this judicious Chinese) persua¦ded that he should be always rich, if his labourers were so, establish'd only a very moderate duty on all the merchandize entered at his port; the produce of his lands appearing to him sufficient to render him powerful and great. His integrity, his moderation, and his humanity made him re∣spected. He never wished to reign; but only to establish the empire of reason. His son, who now fills his place, inherits his virtu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s as well as his possessions: by agriculture, and the commerce he carries on with the produce of his lands, he has become so pow∣erful, that the barbarians, his neighbours▪ stile him King,—a title which he despises. He pre∣tends to no right of sovereignty, but the noblest of all, that of do∣ing good; happy in being the first labourer, and the first mer∣chant of his country, he merits, as well as his father, a title more glorious than that of king—<HI>the friend of mankind.</HI></P>
<P>How different such men from those conquerors so celebrated, who amaze and desolate the earth! who, abusing the right of con∣quest, have established laws which, even after the world has been de∣livered from these tyrants, has perpetuated, for ages, the mise∣ries of the human race.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CAMBOYA</HI> and <HI>TSIAMPA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TO the northward of Ponthi∣amas we find the countries of Camboya and Tsiampa. They are naturally fertile, (Camboya in particular) and appear, in former times, to have been well cultivated; but the government of these two little states, having no settled form, the inhabitants being perpetually employed in destroying tyrants, only to receive others in their place, have aban∣doned the culture of their grounds. Their fields, which might be co∣vered with rice, with herds, and with flocks, are deserts; and the natives are reduced to feed on a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w wretched roots, which they gather from amidst the brambles, which overspread their lands.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="015853_0039_0F9A2FB48F36B2F8"/>Travellers are surprised to find, at a little distance from the wretched canton of Camboya, the ruins of an old city, built with stone, the architecture of which has some resemblance to that of Europe. The neighbouring fields too still preserve the traces of ridges: every thing shews that a∣griculture and the other arts have once flourished there; but they have now disappeared, with the nation who cultivated them.— Those who at present inhabit this country have no history, no tra∣dition even, which can throw the faintest light upon the subject.</P>

<HEAD>COCHIN-CHINA.</HEAD>
<P>THE Cochin-chinese, who border on Camboya to the north, observing the lands of this kingdom desolate and abandoned, some years ago took possession of such tracts as were most conveni∣ent, and have there introduced an excellent culture. The pro∣vince of Donnay, usurped in this manner from Camboya, is at pre∣sent the granary of Cochin-china. This kingdom, one of the greatest in Eastern Asia, about one hun∣dred and fifty years ago, was in∣habited by an inconsiderable na∣tion, barbarous and savage, known by the name of <HI>Loi,</HI> who, living partly by fishing, partly on roots, and the wild fruits of the country, paid little regard to agriculture.</P>
<P>A Tonquinese prince, unsuc∣cessful in a war he carried on a∣gainst the king of Tonquin, (un∣der whom he enjoyed an office somewhat resembling the maires de palais, under the Merovingian race of the kings of France) re∣tired with his soldiers and adher∣ents across the river which divides that kingdom from Cochin-china. The savages, who then possessed this country, fled before these strangers, and took refuge among the mountains of Tsiampa. Af∣ter a long war with their old ene∣mies, who pursued them, the Tonquinese fugitives remained at length peaceable possessors of the country known under the name of Cochin-china: it extends a∣bout two hundred leagues from north to south, but narrow and unequal from east to west. These then applied themselves entirely to the cultivation of rice, which, being the ordinary food of the in∣habitants of Asia, is to them an object of the greatest importance. They separated into little canton∣ments, and established themselves on the plains, which extend a∣long the banks of the rivers.</P>
<P>The fertility of the soil, which had lain long uncultivated, soon recompensed their labours by a∣bundance: population increased in proportion to the culture; and their cantons extended in such a manner, that all the plains of this vast country being put into a state of improvement, they were temp∣ted to make encroachments on those of Camboya, which were in a manner totally abandoned. I never saw any country where the progress of population was so re∣markable as in Cochin-china, which must be attributed not only to the climate, and the fertility of the soil, but to the simplicity
<PB N="43" REF="015853_0040_0F9A2FB5C8278A28"/>
of their manners, to the prudence and industry of the women as well as the men, and to the variety of excellent fish, which, with rice, is their ordinary food.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="description of agriculture">
<HEAD><HI>CULTURE</HI> of different Kinds of <HI>RICE</HI> in <HI>COCHIN-CHINA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Cochin-chinese culti∣vate six different kinds of rice: the <HI>Little Rice,</HI> the grain of which is small, oblong and tran∣sparent; that is by far the most delicate; it is generally admini∣nistered to the sick: The <HI>Great Long Rice</HI> is that whose form is round: The <HI>Red Rice,</HI> so called because the grain is enveloped in a husk of a reddish colour, which adheres so closely, that it requires a very uncommon operation to se∣parate it. These three kinds are produced in the greatest abun∣dance, and form the principal subsistence of the natives. They require water, it being necessary to overflow the grounds where they are cultivated.</P>
<P>They raise also two other sorts of dry rice, which grow in dry foil, and, like our wheat, re∣quire no other watering but what they receive from the clouds.— One of these species of rice has a grain as white as snow; when dressed it is of a slimy viscous sub∣stance; they make of it different kinds of paste, such as vermicelli. Both these kinds form a consider∣able article in their commerce to China. They cultivate them on∣ly on the mountains and rising grounds, which they labour with the spade. They sow these grains as we do wheat, about the end of December or beginning of Janu∣ary, when the rainy season ends: they are not above three months in the ground, and yield a plen∣tiful crop.</P>
<P>I am induced to believe, that the culture of this valuable grain would succeed extremely well in France. In the years 1749 and 1750 I often travelled over the mountains of Cochin-china, where this rice is cultivated; they are very high, and the temperature of the air cold: in the month of January, 1750, I observed that the rice was very green, and a∣bove three inches high, although the liquor in Reaumur's thermo∣meter was only about four degrees above the freezing point.</P>
<P>I carried some quintals of this grain to the isle of France, where it was sown with success, and pro∣duced a greater crop than any o∣ther species. The colonists re∣ceived my present with the great∣est eagerness, as, exclusive of its superior increase, it has a finer taste, is attended with less trou∣ble, there being no necessity for overflowing the fields; and, as it ripens fifteen or twenty days sooner than the other kinds, it can be reaped and secured before the hurricane season, which fre∣quently makes dreadful havock with their later harv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts. The other kinds of rice, being of a slower growth, require their grounds to be laid under water, after the manner of the Coroman∣del
<PB N="44" REF="015853_0041_0F9A2FB60FC5DF50"/>
coast;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See Page <HI>28.</HI></NOTE> but our colonists pay so little attention to agriculture, that they have never hitherto in∣troduced it.</P>
<P>One might have imagined, that the advantages flowing from the cultivation of dry rice, would have engaged the colonists to at∣tend to it with the greatest care; and that, from the isle of France, it might have been with ease in∣troduced into Europe: but I have in vain endeavoured to produce it from this island; those to whom I have applied, have sent me only common rice, which demands water and warmth. The culture of dry rice has, like every other species of agriculture, been a∣bandoned to the unexperienced ignorance of slaves, who have mixed all the different kinds to∣gether, in such a manner, that the rice of Cochin-china being ripe long before the others, the grains have dropt from the ears before they were reaped, and the species, in this manner, has been, by degrees entirely lost in that island. Would any traveller, whom business or curiosity might lead to Cochin-china, send over but a few pounds of this excellent grain, he would deserve our warmest acknowledgements.</P>
<P>The Cochin chinese cultivate the common rice nearly in the same manner with the Malabars on the Coromandel coast. After having twice ploughed their ground, they sow the rice in a little field which has been well laboured with the spade; the sur∣face of this little field they just cover with water, to the height only of a few lines; and as soon as the rice is about five or six inches high, they harrow over their large fields, and overflow them with water; then pulling up the rice plants in the seed plots, transplant them into these grounds thus prepared, in small parcels of four or five stalks, about the dis∣tance of six inches the one from the other. Women and children are generally employed in this work.</P>
<P>The Cochin-chinese have no machine for overflowing their grounds, nor have they any occa∣sion: their plains, from one end of the kingdom to the other, are commanded by a chain of high mountains, plentifully supplied with springs and rivulets, which naturally overflow the grounds, according as their course is di∣rected.</P>
<P>They cultivate likewise differ∣ent kinds of grain, such as the mahis, millets of different sorts, several species of the French bean, potatoes, yams, and a variety of roots proper for the subsistence of men and animals. But the cul∣ture of most important advantage to them, next to the rice, is the sugar cane; and no country in Asia produces it in greater abun∣dance than Cochin-china.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of plant">
<PB N="45" REF="015853_0042_0F9A2FB6CF9EF660"/>
<HEAD>SUGAR-CANES.</HEAD>
<P>THE sugar-canes of this country are of two kinds; the first grows thick and tall, the joints at a considerable distance from one another, the colour al∣ways green, the juice abundant, with very little of the salt in it. This species of cane is in general use for feeding and fattening of cattle; and experience teaches them, that no kind of food fat∣tens sooner or better the human species, as well as animals, than this sugar cane, eat while green, and the sugar which is extracted from it.</P>
<P>The second species is smaller in every respect, with its joints approaching nearer together:— when ripe it assumes a yellow co∣lour; and contains less water, and more salt, than the other.</P>
<P>The Cochin-chinese, when preparing the ground for the su∣gar-cane, turn it up to the depth of two feet; this operation is per∣formed with a plank. They then plant joints or eyes of the cane, three and three together, in a ho∣rizontal position, in the same manner almost as they plant vines in several provinces of France— These slips are planted ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quer∣wise about eighteen inches deep in the ground, distant six feet from one another; this operation they perform near the end of the rainy season, in order that the slips may be sufficiently watered, till such time as they have taken root. During the first six months, they give them two dressings with a kind of pick-axe, in order to destroy the weeds, and preserve a moisture about the roots of the canes, by heaping the earth a∣round them.</P>
<P>Twelve and sometimes fourteen months after the plantation, they gather the first crop. By this time the canes, though planted at the distance of six feet, become so bushy that it is impossible to enter the field, without the assist∣ance of a hatchet to clear your way.</P>
<P>The canes being cut, and tied up into bundles, are carried to their mills, in order to extract their juice. I shall not here de∣scribe the form of these machines, which resemble in a great mea∣sure those of the West-Indies:— instead of water, they employ horned cattle or mules to set in motion the two cylinders, be∣tween which the sugar canes are pressed. These engines have been described by numbers of travel∣lers.</P>
<P>The juice being extracted, they boil it some hours in large kettles, in order to evaporate part of its water: it is then transported to the neighbouring market, and sold in that condition. Here ends the industry and the profits of the Cochin chinese planter.— The merchants purchase the juice, which resembles pure water; they boil it again, throwing into the kettles some alkaline substance, such as the ashes of the leaves of the musa or bananier, and shell-lime; they are acquainted with no other; these ingredients throw up a thick scum, which the refin∣er carefully skims off; the action of the alkali hastens the separation of the salt from the water, and,
<PB N="46" REF="015853_0043_0F9A2FB78FBDD4B8"/>
by the force of ebullition, reduces the juice of the cane to the con∣sistence of syrup. As soon as this syrup begins to granulate, they decant it into a great earthen ves∣sel, where they cool it about an hour; when a kind of crust, still soft, and of a yellowish colour, appeals on the surface of the sy∣rup; they lose not a moment then to empty it into a vessel of a co∣nic shape, which they call a <HI>form.</HI> Without this intermediate opera∣tion of cooling the syrup, it would harden into a mass, and not being granulated, would con∣sequently want one essential qua∣lity of sugar.</P>
<P>These sugar-cones, or forms in Cochin-china are, like those of our West-India colonies, of baked earth, about three feet high, pierced at their narrow extremi∣ties, and contain in general about forty or fifty pounds of sugar.— These <HI>forms,</HI> when full, are pla∣ced on another earthen vessel, the mouth of which is proportioned to receive the narrow end of the cone, and must be large enough to contain the coarse syrup, which distils from the sugar, through some straw which imperfectly stops up the little opening in the bottom of the <HI>form.</HI></P>
<P>When they suppose the syrup has acquired the consistence of salt in every part of the cone, they then proceed to whiten and purify it. They dilute, in a trough, a fine sort of whitish clay, with such a quantity of water as, when thus prepared, prevents it from having too much consistence; with a truel they then lay it upon the surface of the sugar to the thick∣ness of about two inches, in the void space left at the top of the form by the condensing of the sugar, after purging itself of the coarser syrup or melasses. The water contained in the clay pene∣trating by degrees into the mass, washes it, and carries off insensi∣bly the remaining syrup, and e∣very foreign particle that adheres most closely to the sugar. When the clay hardens, they replace it with a fresh quantity, diluted as the first: This operation, which lasts about twelve or fifteen days, is the same here as in our West-India colonies. Some refiners of Cochin-china, however, have a∣nother method. In place of clay, tempered thus with water, they cut into small pieces the trunk of the musa or bananier, which they place upon the sugar: The trunk of this tree is very watery; the water of a detergent quality; and distils from the fibres, which en∣velope it, in very small drops.— Those who follow this method pretend, that the operation is thereby rendered less tedious, and that the sugar acquires a finer colour.</P>
<P>The process of the Cochin-chinese, in refining their sugar, goes no further: They are unac∣quainted with the stoves in use in the West-Indies. After having clayed their sugars sufficiently, they sell them in the public mar∣kets, particularly to the Chinese, and other strangers, who are in∣vited to their ports by the mode∣rate price of this commodity, which is cheaper at Cochin-china than any where in India.</P>
<P>The white sugar of the best quality is generally sold at the port of Faiso, in exchange for o∣ther merchandize, at the rate of three piastres (about fourteen shillings) the Cochin-china quin∣tal, which weighs from one hun∣dred
<PB N="47" REF="015853_0044_0F9A2FB8513D8B30"/>
and fifty to two hundred pounds French.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg">Ninety one pounds eight ounces French make one hundred pounds English.</NOTE> The trade in this commodity is immense.— The Chinese alone, whose lands do not produce enough for their own consumpt, purchase annually from Cochin-china about forty thousand barrels, weighing about two thousand pounds per barrel.</P>
<P>This country, it should be ob∣served, which produces this com∣modity in such abundance, and at so low a price, being a new king∣dom, ought to be considered, in some measure, as a colony: it is worthy observation too, that the sugar-cane is there cultivated by free men, and all the process of preparation and refining, the work of free hands. Compare then the price of the Cochin-chi∣nese production with the same commodity which is cultivated and prepared by the wretched slaves of our European colonies, and judge if, to procure sugar from our colonies, it was necessa∣ry to authorize by law the slavery of the unhappy Africans trans∣ported to America. From what I have observed at Cochin-china, I cannot entertain a doubt, but that our West-India colonies, had they been distributed without re∣servation amongst a free people, would have produced double the quantity that is now procured from the labour of the unfortu∣nate negroes.</P>
<P>What advantage, then, has ac∣crued to Europe, civilized as it is, and thoroughly versed in the laws of nature, and the rights of mankind, by legally authorising in our colonies the daily outrages against human nature, permitting them to debase man almost below the level of the beasts of the field? These slavish laws have proved as opposite to its interest as they are to its honour, and to the laws of humanity. This remark I have often made.</P>
<P>Liberty and property form the basis of abundance, and good a∣griculture: I never observed it to flourish where those rights of mankind were not firmly esta∣blished. The earth, which mul∣tiplies her productions with a kind of profusion, under the hands of the free-born labourer, seems to shrink into barrenness under the sweat of the slave. Such is the will of the great author of our nature, who has created man free, and assigned to him the earth, that he might cultivate his possession with the sweat of his brow; but still should enjoy his liberty.</P>
<P>The Cochin-chinese, exclusive of the sugar-cane, employ them∣selves in the culture of a variety of other productions, of great im∣portance both to their interior fabrics, and external commerce.</P>
<P>They cultivate the cotton-tree, the mulberry, the pepper, the varnish-tree, the date, the tea, the indigo, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ffron, to∣gether with a plant peculiar to the country, called <HI>Tjai,</HI> which, being fermented like indigo, fur∣nishes in great plenty a flower of a green colour, which, in dying, gives a durable tincture of a fine emerald colour. This plant would undoubtedly be a most valuable present to our West-India colonies.</P>
<P>I must at present decline enter∣ing into a description of the va∣rious
<PB N="48" REF="015853_0045_0F9A2FB911500D78"/>
processes attending these different cultures. They will af∣ford subject for some future me∣moirs.</P>
<P>The soil, in general, of Co∣chin-china, is excellent, and they cultivate it well. Their moun∣tains in general are fallow, as population is not even sufficiently considerable for the cultivation of all the plain grounds they have taken possession of in Camboya: These mountains produce, how∣ever, the eagle or aloe-wood, which is the most precious per∣fume in the world; the sapan-wood, the same with that of Bra∣sil; and the cinnamon, in small quantities indeed, but much su∣perior in quality to that of Cey∣lon▪—The Chinese pay three or four times more for it than for that which the Dutch import from that island. They have several sorts likewise of admirable wood for joyner and cabinet work, par∣ticularly the rose wood; the tea-wood is excellent for building, and is preferred to all others in the construction of the royal gal∣leys, having every pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>perty that can be wished for either for beauty or solidity. From their moun∣tains also, and from the forests with which they are covered, they procure ivory, musk, wax, iron, and gold in great abundance — These mountains too are full of game, such as deer, antelopes, wild goats, peacocks pheasants, &amp;c. The chace is free to all, but dangerous from the number of tygers, elephants, rhinoceros, and other carnivorous and de∣structive animals, with which the forests abound.</P>
<P>The sea, which washes their coasts, as well as the rivers, are well supplied with excellent fish. Every one has the liberty of fish∣ing; and in this the Cochin-chinese take great delight. I have already observed, that they live chiefly on fish and rice.</P>
<P>Their domestic animals are, the horse for the road, the buffalo for labour, and the cow, the hog, the goat, the goose, the duck, and hens of various kinds, for the table. These animals thrive ex∣tremely well, and are in great a∣bundance. The king alone re∣serves to himself the exclusive right of breeding elephants for the war; and this is a reservation which no man envies him. He maintains generally four hundred of them: he could maintain four thousand men at a much less ex∣pence. The Cochin-chinese have few good fruits; the pine apple, and oranges of different kinds, are the best their country produces. They do not cultivate the vine, though it is one of the native pro∣ductions of their lands. They are but indifferently provided with pulse. In a word, their or∣chards and their gardens are very inconsiderable.—They attach themselves to the more essential branches of agriculture.</P>
<P>Although this art is not yet ar∣rived at that degree of perfection in Cochin-China, to which it might be carried, with the ad∣vantage of such an excellent soil, yet the manners of the people be∣ing very favourable, it flourishes greatly. The Cochin-chinese are gentle, hospitable, frugal, and industrious. There is not a beg∣gar in the country; and robbery and murder absolutely unknown. A stranger may wander over the kingdom, from one end to ano∣ther, (the capital excepted) with∣out meeting the slightest insult:

These have acquired the art of separating the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erest of the prince from that of his people.— They have inspired him with the thirst after per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onal riches. The vast quantity of gold which they have dug from the mines, during this reign, has already proved de∣trimental to industry and agri∣culture.

<P>This prince has been insensibly led to despise the simp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e habita∣tions of his ancestors. He has built a supe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b palace, a league in circumference, surrounded by a wall of brick, on the model of that of Pekin.

<P>These designing sycophants, who guard every avenue to the royal ear, have had the address to over-awe the ordinary administra∣tion of justice; and, taking ad∣vantage of exemption from pu∣nishment, have pillaged the la∣bourers, and filled the provinces with oppression and distress.</P>
<P>All along the high roads I have seen whole villages newly aban∣doned by their inhabitants, har∣rassed by fruitless toil, and never ending exactions, and their fields, in consequence, falling back to their first uncultivated state.</P>
<P>In the midst of all this growing disorder, the prince, whose mind has been surprised by faw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing flatterers, and who alone is igno∣rant of the villainy of those around him, still preserves a respect for the manners of his ancestors; he does not, indeed, like his fore∣fathers, give an example of per∣sonal l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bour, but still his desire is to protect agriculture</P>
<P>I have seen him, at the com∣mencement of the new year, pre∣side with all the simplicity of his predecessors, at the general as∣sembly of the nation, which is annually held on that day, in the open field, in order to renew the reciprocal oath for observation of the primordial contract, which established him father of his peo∣ple, at the same time that they invested him alone with the pow∣er, the noblest indeed of all, of making his people happy.</P>
<P>When he speaks of his subjects, he calls them still by no other name than that of his children.

<P>Corruption, it is true, has not yet infected the general b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy of the people: They still preserve their primitive manners: it is hitherto confined to the palace, and the capital: its source, how∣ever, is too elevated to prevent its poisoned streams from flowing to the plains.

<HEAD>CHINA.</HEAD>
<P>I Now approach the period of my Travels. Departing from the coasts of Cochin-china, and directing my course towards the north-east, I proceeded for China, which the Cochin chinese call, with great respect, <HI>Nuse d' ai Ming—the Kingdom of the Great Luminary.</HI> After s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me days na∣vigation, before there was any appearance of land, I perceived along the horizon a forest of masts, and soon after an innumerable multitude of boats, which covered the surface of the water. These were Thousands of fishermen, whose industry drew from the deeps subsistence for numbers.— The land <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow began to rise to my view; I advanced to the mouth of the river, still amidst crowds of fishers, throwing out their lines on every side. I entered the river of Canton; it is peopled like the land; its banks lined with ships at a chor; a prodigious number of small craft are continually gliding along in every direction, some with sails, others wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h oars, vanishing often suddenly from the sight, as they enter the number∣less canals, dug with amazing la∣bour, across extensive plains, which they water and fertilize. Immense fields, covered with all the glory of the harvest, with stately villages rising to the eye on every side, adorn the remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er view, whilst mountains, covered with verdure, cut into terrasses, and shaped into amphitheatres, form the back ground of this no∣ble land<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cape.</P>
<P>I arrive at Canton, where new subjects for admiration arise:— The noise, the motion, the crowd augments: The water, as well as land, being every where covered with multitudes. Astonished at the amazing app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arance, I en∣quire into the numbers of inhabi∣tants of this city and suburbs; and, after comparing different accounts, find that they must a∣mount at last to eight hundred thousand souls. My surprize, however, is greatly increased, when I learn, that, to the north∣ward of Canton, about five leagues up the river, is a village named <HI>Fuchan,</HI> which contains a million of inhabitants, and that every part of this great empire, extend∣ing about six hundred leagues from north to south, and as much from east to west, was peopled in the same proportion.</P>
<P>By what art can the earth pro∣duce subsistence for such numb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs? Do the Chinese possess any sec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et art of multiplying the grain and provisions necessary for the nou∣rishment

<PB N="53" REF="015853_0050_0F9A2FBCCF9522C0"/>
that we deviated greatly from the point in view, could he read our treatises ancient and modern, our marvellous speculations on agri∣culture: what would he say, if he saw our lands, part of them fallow, part of them employed in useless cultures, and the remain∣der wretchedly laboured? What would he say, what must be his feelings, if, in travelli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g over our fields, he observed the ex∣treme misery and barbarism of their wretched cultivators?</P>
<P>The Chinese lands, in general, are not superior to ours: you see there, as with us, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me excellent grounds, others middling, the rest bad: some soils strong, o∣thers light: lands where clay, and lands where sand, gravel, and flint every where predomi∣nate.</P>
<P>All these grounds, even in the northern provinces, yield annu∣ally two crops, and in those to∣wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth often five in two years, without one singl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fallow season, during the many thou∣sand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that they have been converted to the purposes of a∣griculture.</P>
<P>The Chinese use the same ma∣nures as we do, in order to re∣store to their grounds those salts and ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, which an unintermit∣ting production is perpetu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly consuming. They are acquaint∣ed with mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: They employ also common sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, lime, ashes, and all sorts of animal dung, but a∣bove all that which we throw in to our rivers: They make great use of urine, which is carefully preserved in every house, and sold to advantage: in a word, e∣very t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>duced by the earth is re conv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed to it with the greatest care, into whatever shape the operations of nature or art may have transformed it.</P>
<P>When their manures are at any time scarce, they supply the defi∣ciency, by turning up the ground with the spade, to a great depth, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch brings up to the surface of the field a new soil, enriched with the juices of that which de∣scends in its room.</P>
<P>Without meadows the Chinese maintain a number of horses, buf∣faloes, and other animals of every species necessary for labour, for sustenance, and for manure — These animals are fed, some with straw, others with roots, beans, and grain of every kind. It is true, they have fewer horses, and horned cattle, in proportion, than we have, yet it is not necessary that they should have more.</P>
<P>The whole country is cut into canals, dug by the industry of the inhabitants, extending from river to river which divide and water this vast empire, like a garden. —Travelli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g, transporting of goods, almost every species of carriage is performed on these canals, with great ease, and small expence: They do not even use ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses to drag their boats; every thing is done by the sail or the car, which they manage with sin∣gular dexterity, even in going up the rivers. Where any kind of labour can be performed, at a moderate price by m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, it is a maxim with them never to em∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy animals. In consequence of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, the banks of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> canals are cul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivated almost to the water's edge: They lose not an inch of ground: Their public roads re∣semble our foot-paths: Their ca∣nals, however, are infinitely more useful than highways: They convey fertility every where, and
<PB N="54" REF="015853_0051_0F9A2FBE14E2F068"/>
furnish the people great part of their subsistence in fish.—There is no comparison between the weight which can b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> transported in a boat, and that which can be conveyed by any kind of land-carriage; no proportion between the expence.</P>
<P>The Chinese are still less ac∣quainted with the use, or rather the luxury of chariots, and equi∣pages of every kind, which croud the principal cities of Europe.— The horses necessary for these, assembled in thousands in our ca∣pitals, consume the produce of numberless acres of our best grounds, which, if cultivated with grain, would afford subsist∣ence for multitudes, who are dy∣ing of hunger. The Chinese wish rather to maintain men than horses.</P>
<P>The emperor and chief magi∣strates are carried through their cities by men, with safety, and with dignity: Their march is se∣date and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>jestic, it threatens not with dang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r those who walk on foot: They travel in a kind of galleys, safer, more commo∣dious, equally magnificent, and less expensive than equipages.</P>
<P>I have before observed, that the Chinese lose not an inch of ground. They are very far, therefore, from alloting immense parks, of the finest ground, for the maintenance alone of deer, in contempt of the human race — The emperors, even those of the Tartar line, have never hitherto dreamed of forming these parks; still less the grandees, that is, the magistrates and the learned: such an idea could never find place in the mind of a Chinese. Even their country houses, and boxes of pleasure, present nothing to the eye all around, but us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful cultures, agreeably div<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsified — That which constitutes their prin∣cipal beauty, is their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lightful situation, j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>diciously improved, where, in the disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of the various parts which form the whole, there every where reigns a h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppy imitation of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beauti∣ful disorder of nature, from whence art has borrowed all her charms.</P>
<P>The most rocky hills, which, in France, and other places of Europe, they turn into vineyards, or totally neglect, are there com∣pelled, by dint of industry, to produce grain. The Chinese are acquainted, indeed, with the vine, which here and there they plant in arbours; but they con∣sider it as a luxury, and the wine it produces as an unnecessary su∣perfluity: They would imagine it a sin against humanity, to endea∣vour to procure, by cultivation, an agreeable liquo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, whilst, from the want of that grain which this vineyard might have produced, some individual perhaps might be in danger of perishing of hunger.</P>

<P>The Chinese nation is capable of the most stupendous works; in point of labour I never observed their equals in the world.

This wise maxim is fixed in the breast of every Chinese; and, with this people so open to rea∣son, he who pronounces a wise maxim pronounces a law.</P>
<P>Behold, gentlemen, a slight sketch of the general picture of Chinese agriculture, with the pe∣culiar genius of that people for this art. The limits of my dis∣course will not permit me at pre∣sent to enter into a detail of the different cultures I have seen in this country: I shall only observe, that they are such as abundantly supply all the wants, and conve∣niences of the most populous na∣tion in the world, and furnish, with their superfluity, an impor∣tant article for foreign commerce.</P>
<P>From these observations it is obvious, that agriculture flou∣rishes in China more than in any other country in the world: yet it is not to any process peculiar to their labour, it is not to the form of their plough, or their method of sowing, that this happy state, and the plenty consequent on it, is to be attributed; it must chief∣ly be derived from their mode of Government, the immoveable foundations of which have been laid deep, by the hand of reason alone, coeval almost with the be∣ginning of time; and from their laws, dictated by nature to the first of the human race, and sa∣cred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y preserved from generation to generation, engraved in the united hearts of a great peo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le,
<PB N="56" REF="015853_0053_0F9A2FBF1072B180"/>
not in obscure codes, devised by chicanery and deceit.—In a word, China owes the prosperity of her agriculture to the simplicity of her manners, and to her laws, which are the laws of nature and reason.</P>
<P>This empire was founded by labourers, in those happy times when the laws of the great Crea∣tor were still held in remembrance and the culture of the earth con∣sidered as the noblest of all em∣ployments, the most worthy of mankind, and the general occu∣pation of all. From <HI>Fou hi</HI> (who was the first chief of this nation, some hundreds of years after the deluge, if we follow the version of the Septuagint, and in this quality p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esided over agriculture) all the emperors, without excep∣tion, even to this day, glory in being the first labourers of their empire.</P>
<P>The Chinese history has care∣fully preserved an anecdote of ge∣nerosity in two of the ancient em∣perors, who, not perceiving a∣mong their children any one worthy to mount a throne, which virtue alone ought to inherit, na∣med, as their successors, two sim∣ple labourers. These labourers, according to the Chinese annals, advanced the happiness of man∣kind, during very long reigns: Their memory is still held in the hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hest veneration.

<HEAD>Ceremony of opening the Grounds.</HEAD>
<P>ON the fifteenth day of the first moon, in every year, which generally corresponds to the beginning of March, the emperor in person performs the ceremony of opening the grounds. This prince, in great pomp, pro∣ceeds to the field appointed for the ceremony: the princes of the imperial family, the presidents of the five great tribunals, and an infinite number of mandarins ac∣company him. Two sides of the field are occupied by the empe∣ror's officers, and guards; the third is allotted for all the labour∣ers of the province, who repair thither to behold their art ho∣noured and practised by the head of their empire; the fourth is re∣served for the mandarins.</P>
<P>The emperor enters the field alone, prostrates himself, and nine times strikes his head against the ground, in adoration of <HI>Tien,</HI> the God of heaven; he pro∣nounces, with a loud voice, a prayer appointed by the tribunal of rites, invoking the blessing of the almighty sovereign on his labour, and on the labour of his people, who form his family; he then, in quality of sovereign pontiff of the empire, sacrifices a bullock, which he offers up to heaven, as the source of every blessing: whilst they cut the vic∣tim in pieces, and place them on the altar, they bring to the em∣peror a plough, in which are yoked a pair of bullocks, mag∣nificently adorned. The empe∣ror then, laying aside his royal robes, takes hold of the handle of the plough, and turns up se∣veral furrows the whole length of the field; then, with a complai∣sant air, having delivered the plough to the mandarins, they successively follow his example, emulating one another in per∣forming this honourable labour with the greatest dexterity. The ceremony concludes with the dis∣tribution of money, and pieces of stuff, among the labourers there present; the most active of whom finish the remaining labour, in presence of the emperor, with great agility and address.</P>
<P>Some time after, when they have sufficiently laboured and manured their grounds, the em∣peror repairs again, in procession, and begins the sowing of the field, always accompanied with ceremony, and attended by the labourers of the province.</P>
<P>The same ceremonies are per∣formed, on the same days, in all the provinces of the empire, by the viceroys, assisted by all the magistrates of their departments, in presence of a great number of the labourers of their respective provinces. I have seen this o∣pening of the grounds at Canton, and never remember to have be∣held any of the ceremonies in∣vented by men, with half the pleasure and satisfaction with which I observed this.</P>

Every year the viceroys of the provinces send to court the names of such la∣bourers as have chiefly distin∣guished themselves in their em∣ployments, either by cultiva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing grounds till then c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsidered as barren, or, by a superior culture, improving the production of such lands as forme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly had bore grain. These names are presented to the emperor, who confers on them honorary titles, to distinguish them above their fellow labour∣ers. If any man has made an important discovery, which may influence the improvement of a∣griculture, or should he, in any manner, deserve more distinguish∣ed marks of regard than the rest, the emperor invites him to Pekin, de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ray<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng his journey, with dig∣nity, at the expence of the em∣pire; he receives him into his palace, interrogates him with regard to his abilities, his age, the numb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of his children, the extent and quality of his lands; then dismisses him to his plough, distinguished by honourable titles and loaded with benefits and fa∣vours.</P>
<P>Who is happiest, gentlemen, the prince who conducts himself in this manner, or the nation who is thus governed? Amongst a people where all are equal, where every one aspires after dis∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctions, such encouragements cannot fail to inspire a love for labour, and an emulation for the cultivation of the ground.</P>

<HEAD>Attention of the <HI>CHINESE</HI> Government.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole attention, in general, of the Chinese government, is directed towards agriculture. The principal ob∣ject of the father of a family, ought to be the sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stence of his children. The state of the fields, in consequence, forms the great object of the toils, the cares, and the solicitudes of the magistrates. It may be easily conceived, that, with such dispositions, the go∣vernment has not neglected to se∣cure to the labourers that liberty, property, and indulgence which are the great springs for the im∣provement of agriculture.</P>
<P>The Chinese enjoy, undisturb∣ed, their private possessions, as well as those which, being by their nature indivisible, belong to all, such as the sea, the rivers, the canals, the fish which they contain, and the beasts of the forest: naviga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, fishing, and the chace are free to every one; and he who buys a field, or re∣ceives it by inheritance from his ancestors, is of course the sole lord and master.</P>
<P>The lands are free as the peo∣ple; no feudal services, and no fines of alienation; none of those men interested in the misfortunes of the public; none of those far∣mers who never amass more ex∣orbitant fortunes, than when an unfavourable season has ruined
<PB N="59" REF="015853_0056_0F9A2FC14F38B698"/>
the country, and reduced the un∣happy labourer to perish for want, after having toiled the year round for the sustenance of his fellow subjects; none of that destructive profession, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atched in the delirium of the feudal system, under whose auspices arise milli∣ons of processes, which drag the labourer from his plough into the obscure and dangerous mazes of chicane, and thereby rob him, while defending his rights, of that time which would have been importantly employed in the ge∣neral service of mankind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of imposts">
<HEAD>The <HI>IMPOSTS</HI> established in <HI>CHINA</HI> invariable.</HEAD>
<P>IN China there is no other lord, no other superior, who has power to levy taxes, but the common father of the family, the emperor. The bonzes [priests of the sect of Fo-hi] accustomed to receive alms from a charitable people, would be very indiffer∣ently received, should they pre∣tend that this alms is a right which heaven has bestowed upon them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of imposts">
<HEAD>The Imposts called the Tenth.</HEAD>
<P>THIS impost, which is not exactly the tenth part of the produce, is regulated accord∣ing to the nature of the grounds: in bad soils it is perhaps only the thirtieth part, and so in propor∣tion. This impost, however, of the tenth part of the produce of the earth, which belongs to the emperor, is the only tax on the lands, the only tribute known in China since the origin of the mo∣narchy; and such is the happy respect which the Chinese have for their ancient customs, that an emperor of China would never entertain the most distant thought of augmenting it, nor his sub∣jects the least apprehension of such augmentation. The people pay it, in kind, not to avaricious farmers-generals, but to upright magistrates, their proper and na∣tural governors. The amount of this tribute, though apparently trifling, must be immense, when we consider that it is levied on e∣very foot of ground of the most extensive and best cultivated em∣pire in the world. This tax is paid with the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atest fidelity, as they kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w the purposes to which it is applied. They know, that part of it is laid up in immense magazines, distributed over every province of the empire, and al∣lotted for the maintenance of the magistrates and soldi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry: they know, that, in the event of scar∣city, these magazines are open to all, and the wants of the peo∣ple supplied with part of that which was received from them in times of abundance: they know too, that the remainder of this import is sold in the public mar∣kets, and the produce of it faith∣fully carried to the treasury of the empire, the custody of which is intrusted to the respectable tribu∣nal of <HI>Ho-pou,</HI> from whence it never is issued but to supply the general wants of the family.</P>

<HEAD><HI>COMPARISON</HI> of the <HI>AGRICULTURE</HI> of <HI>AFRICA</HI> and <HI>ASIA</HI> with that of <HI>CHINA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>RECOLLECT, gentlemen, what I have said of the laws, the manners, and the customs of the different nations of Africa and Asia, the state of whose a∣griculture I have examined:— compare nation with nation, and then judge, if the unfortunate Malabar, without property, sub∣jected to the tyrannical govern∣ment of the Moguls; judge if a race of slaves, under the iron scepter of the despot of Siam;— judge if the Malais, ever turbu∣lent, and fettered by their feudal laws; judge, I say, if these na∣tions, though possessing the finest grounds in the world, can possi∣bly ever make agriculture to flou∣rish like the Chinese, governed as a family, and subjected to the laws of reason alone — I shall a∣gain repeat, therefore, with con∣fidence, that, in every country in the world, the fate of agriculture depends solely on the laws there established, on the manners of the people, and even on the preju∣dices which derive their origin from those laws.</P>
<P>What industry have the inha∣bitants of the earth displayed, from one extremity of the globe to the other, in rendering them∣selves unhappy! Created to live in society, to cultivate the earth, and enjoy from their labour the infinite blessings of the great Creator, they had only to listen to the voice of nature who would have taught them happiness be∣low: in place of which, they have strained their faculties in the invention of barbarous insti∣tutions, and perplexing legisla∣tions, which being ill adapted to the feelings of mankind, and dis∣cordant with that law which is engraved in every man's breast, their establishment could only be eff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted by force, deluging the world with blood; and which, once established, have continued to desolate the earth, checking population by the oppression of agriculture.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>STATE</HI> of <HI>AGRICULTURE</HI> in <HI>EUROPE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHAT an object for an attentive traveller, to ob∣serve the state of agriculture a∣mongst the various people who divide the globe! In Europe be∣hold it at present flourishing, in a country which, during many preceding ages, was reduced to the necessity of begging subsistence amongst the neighbouring nati∣ons, who possessed a happier cli∣mate, and a greater extent of territory. During those ages of barbarism, their loss of liberty and right of property brought a∣long with them the ruin of culti∣vation; nor has she recovered those natural rights of mankind, and re-established the foundations of drooping agriculture, but through seas of blood, and out∣rages shocking to humanity.</P>

<HEAD>In <HI>AFRICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFRICA, in general, whose regions, known to the an∣cients, were considered as the granaries of the world, now pre∣sent nothing to the view but grounds entirely neglected, or wretchedly cultivated by the la∣bour of slaves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of agriculture">
<HEAD>In <HI>AMERICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOUTH-AMERICA, covered with marshes, brambles, and woods, beholds her extensive tracks hardened even by the sweat of her labourers in chains. The northern regions of that quarter of the world, before the arrival of the Europeans, was inhabited by inconsiderable tribes of savages, miserable, and with∣out culture; yet free, and, in consequence, less wretched per∣haps than those nations who pre∣tend to be civilized; but who, being farther removed from the laws of nature, by the privation of those rights which she bestow, make ineffectual efforts to pro∣cure that happiness, which a good agriculture alone can produce.— Since the Europeans arrived, and began in earnest to cultivate the lands, they have, by their great diligence in agriculture, wonder∣fully improved the climate as well as the soil; by continuing their attachment to agriculture, North-America will probably, in a few years, extend her commerce over the greatest part of the globe.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="description of agriculture">
<HEAD>In <HI>ASIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE vast continent of Asia offers to your consideration in one quarter, an immense un∣cultivated region, peopled by a race of banditti, more intent on plunder than the cultivation of their grounds; in another, a great empire, formerly flourish∣ing, and excellently laboured, now inhabited by the poor re∣mains of a wretched people, pe∣rishing with hunger from the neglect of agriculture, and shed∣ding their blood, not for liberty, but for a change of tyrants — This charming fertile quarter of the world (the cradle of the hu∣man race) now beholds her lands in slavery, her labourers in chains, subjected either to the blind des∣potism of unfeeling tyrants, or the destructive yoke of the feudal system.</P>
<P>But turn your eyes to the east∣ern extremity of the Asiatic con∣tinent, inhabited by the Chinese, and there you will conceive a ra∣vishing idea of the happiness the world might enjoy, were the laws of this empire the model of those of other countries. This great nation unites under the shade of agriculture, founded on liberty and reason, all the advantages

<P>Princes, who rule over nati∣ons! arbiters of their fate! view well this perspective; it is worthy your attention. Would you wish abundance to flourish in your dominions, would you favour po∣pulation, and make your people happy; behold those innumera∣ble multitudes which over spread the territories of China, who leave not a shred of ground un∣cultivated; it is liberty, it is their undisturbed right of proper∣ty that has established a cultivati¦on so flour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, under the aus¦pices of which this people have increased as the grains which cover their fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lds.</P>
<P>Does the glory of being the most p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>werful, the richest, and the happiest of sovereigns touch your ambition, turn your eyes towards Pekin, and behold the most powerful of mortal beings seated on the throne of reason:— he does not command, he in∣structs; — his words are not de∣crees, they are the maxims of justice and wisdom; — his people obey him, because his orders are dictated by equity alone.</P>
<P>He is the most powerful of men, reigning over the hearts of the most numerous society in the world, who constitute his family. — He is the richest of sovereigns, drawing from an extent of terri∣tory six hundred leagues square, cultivated even to the summits of the mountains, the tenth of those abundant harvests it incessantly produces: this he considers as the wealth of his children, and he husbands it with care.—To sum up all, he is the happiest of mo∣narchs, tasting every d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the in∣expressible pleasure of giving hap∣piness to millions, and alone en∣joying, undivided, that satisfac∣tion which his subjects share— his children! all to him equally dear; all living like brothers, in freedom and abundance, under hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> protection.</P>
<P>He is called the son of <HI>Tien,</HI> as the true and most perfect image of heaven, whose benevolence he imitates; and his grateful people adore him as a God, because his conduct is worthy of a man.</P>
