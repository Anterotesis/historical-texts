<OPENER><SALUTE>Friendly &amp; Christian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS we believe it to be the Express Command of our blessed Saviour <HI>Matth. 5.34 Not to swear at all,</HI> and that therefore we refuse to swear in any case so it is chiefly the Subject of the following undertaking to shew that our Testimony therein is truly consistent with the harmonious Belief and Testimony of divers Primitive Christians, famous Fathers godly Martyrs &amp; learned Protestants, leaving behind for brevity sake many more that might be instanced: for though Christianity hath sustained a great Degeneracy in this and also many other things, yet there was often found many of great Account in the Church Godly Witnesses that kept up and bore a faithful Testimony to the Doctrine of our Lord in this Matter.</P>
<P>Our Testimonies are abstracted and taken from a book called a Treatise of Oaths, as mentioned in the Title Page in which book our Friends Reasons against Swearing in any Case are largely set forth and then fortified with divers Testimonies of excellent Men &amp; Christians; but that it may not swell too bulky we at present chuse to collect &amp; abstract such of them as appear most suitable to our present Purpose.</P>
<P>The Pages of the said book are set down at the End of each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣tation that they may readily as well as more at large be found.</P>
<P>Our desire in this Work is first to inform those who among our selves may be ignorant how our Christian Doctrine hath been kept to and maintained by the most Antient, as well as modern Christians. Secondly, that those our Neighbours and others who are not of our Perswasion in this case and may think sometimes themselves unsafe under our plain Affirma∣tion, may see that the sentiments of their &amp; our Predecessors,
<PB REF="001578_0003_0FB3D9B5E67E2810"/>
called Fathers in the Church (in Respect to Christ's Prohibi∣tion, and of the little Security there is in Oaths) were exactly one with us in this matter.</P>
<P>And we desire our Neighbours to consider, that our Pensilvania plain Attest (to wit) <HI>I solemnly promise &amp;c.</HI> we had in the beginning of our Settlement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here, and afterwards by Law Established by Coll. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> and was confirm'd by <HI>King William,</HI> and was practised among us, before and since, that time for about twenty years, with∣out any known Prejudice to any one, either in Person or Estate: and until an Order from the <HI>Queen</HI> was procured to put in practice the English Affirmation.</P>
<P>We also think it pertinent to this present work to desire all to consider, that in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> the <HI>Menists,</HI> who are a considerable Body of sober Religious People, and who cann't for Conscience sake take an Oath, nor, as is said bear A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms. are, and have been tolerated among them, for about <HI>130</HI> years, last past, yet do not find any prejudice, or inconveniency in that Respect, to their Commonwealth, Trade or Commerce. And that they were so tolerated, appears by Letters sent from the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> to the Inhabitants of <HI>Middelburgh,</HI> part of one of which Letters is as followeth the said Prince ha∣ving first shewed that the said People supplicated him for Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ef in respect to Oaths, saith thus, —
<Q>Seeing they do there∣in not desire any thing else, than to live in the Liberty of their Consciences, upon which Account this present war against the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath been by his Subjects ta∣ken up, &amp; all Ceremonies contrary thereunto resisted: in which such Advance is, through the help of God, made, that the aforesaid Liberty of Conscience is preserved, and
<PB REF="001578_0004_0FB3D9B756D53318"/>
therefore it would be an unequal thing to deprive the Supplicants thereof who have helped to acquire the same by bearing Taxes, Contributions and other Burthens &amp;c. Especially seeing the aforesaid Petitioners do proffer, that their Yea passing for an Oath, the Transgressor shall be punished as Oath—breakers; therefore his Excellency having considered the premisses, and having maturely de∣liberated upon the same, hath, with the previous Advice of the Governour and Council of <HI>Zealand,</HI> Ordered that the aforesaid Petitioners <HI>Yea,</HI> shall be received, by the Ma∣gistrates of the aforesaid City instead of an Oath, pro∣vided, the Transgressors shall be punished as Oathbreakers. <BIBL>Page 162.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>This was done in the year <HI>1577,</HI> and we hear nothing but they continue so to this day — And in <HI>Hoo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t's</HI> History of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> we find one <HI>Lord &amp;c. Aldegonde</HI> had prest the Prince against giving the said <HI>Menists</HI> the Liberty desired, upon which it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s said, the <HI>Prince</HI> answered sharply, viz.
<Q>That these men's Yea must pass for an Oath, or we must confess that the Papists had Reason enough to force us to a Religion contrary to our Con∣scien'ces.</Q></P>
<P>Also in a Treaty of peace, between the States General, Kings of Spain, England &amp;c. <HI>Anno 1674</HI> there is a Special Article that all Ship Masters of Merchant ships shall carry along with them a sea Brief, declaring that the Master did upon Oath testifie that such ship did properly belong &amp;c. — Yet the solemn Affirmation of those who cannot sware is there taken instead of an Oath, and then their Certificate runs thus, viz.
<Q>These are to Certify &amp;c. that <HI>A. B.</HI> hath solemnly Affirmed and Declared that the Ship &amp;c. <BIBL><HI>page</HI> 165.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>From which it is observable, That though those People cannot <HI>swear,</HI> no, nor bear Arms, yet paying their Taxes and Contribu∣tions (as they declared in their said Supplication they had freely done equal with others,) they had free Liberty to dwell, trade and merchandize among them, upon their bear Yea and Nay, or upon their plain and solemn Affirming or Declaring this or that, with∣out
<PB REF="001578_0005_0FB3D9B8D6463988" MS="y"/>
any Oath, they suffering for the Transgression thereof as Oath breakers. <HI>Note,</HI> so it is by Law Established with us in Pensilvania, and indeed we remember not in scripture, any greater punish∣ment threat'ned against perjured persons than against liars; for all liars are to have part in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone, <HI>Revel 21 8.</HI> Since, therefore, not only God's holy Law, but also our own human Law, gives as great punishment to liars as to per∣jured Persons, what should then Induce any man to break his so∣lemn Word, more than to break his Oath.</P>

Precepts, so as not to <HI>sware</HI> on any Account; however to shew that we are not singular, nor that we put any meaning upon those holy Precepts, contrary to the plain and right meaning thereof, as acknowledged to be such by many godly Fathers and Martyrs, of the primitive Church, and also by many since that time, we have here presented the Reader with abundance of Instances out of their Writings; whereby it may be seen, that we are, as it were encompassed with a Cloud of Witnesses, and there∣fore may be the more encouraged to hold fast our holy Profession, without wavering; yet so as that we first &amp; principally look unto <HI>Jesus</HI> as the Author and Foundation of this our faith, to wit, <HI>Not to Swear at all,</HI> yet so as that when we are legally called to give Evidence &amp;c. &amp; there∣upon openly declare that what we shall say (whether in the Affirmative or Negative) shall be the Truth &amp;c. that we take care it be so; then will our Yea be Yea, and our Nay, Nay, without violating the holy Precept, or being unjust to our Neighbours.</P>
<P>Our Instances, or Testimonies of the Antients are collected out of the aforesaid Treatise of Oaths, and at the end of each Citation, still citing the pages in which they are, also giving the names of the Authors of the said Testi∣monies, with the Titles of their books &amp;c. as far as they are set down.

<P>Now behold Friendly, Reader, Is not here <HI>a Series</HI> of Christian Testimonies, of the Antient and Famous Men of the Church, from the Apostle <HI>James's</HI> time downwards, against taking any <HI>Oath, or Swearing at all,</HI> and abun∣dance more might be brought; yet in as much as accord∣ing to the Proverb, there is nothing can be said but some may Object against it, and knowing many objections to these two positive Precepts, of our LORD and his A∣postle <HI>James,</HI> are brought to oppugn their said Doctrine as professed by us (<HI>viz.) Not to swear in any Case</HI> we think it therefore needful, what in us lies, to remove those objections, and that chiefly in the very words of the forementioned, and other Famous and Learned Men, as cited in the said Treatise of Oaths, still citing the pages where to find them.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. St. Paul saith, That an Oath for confirma∣tion was to them an End of all strife. <HI>Hebr.</HI> 6.16.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> Though Paul as it were indefinitely speaking, saith That among men it was so yet it does not follow that it was always, nor at any time, universally so: for in page 37. of the said Treatise, we read that the <HI>Essaeans</HI> the most Religions People among the Jews, shun'd Oaths as Perjury, and cites <HI>Joseph. de Bello Judaico</HI> l 2. c. 7. and in page 30. cites <HI>Sociad.</HI> in <HI>Stob.</HI> 28. saying It was one part of the Doctrine of the Seven Sages so famous in <HI>Greece;</HI> That men ought not to Swear. And ma∣ny more in the said Treatise are cited both of Jews and Gentiles, even before Christ's time, that denied-Swearing. And cites <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> l. 16, saying That the <HI>Persians</HI> (which was a great People) gave the Right Hand as a
<PB N="11" REF="001578_0016_0FB3D9C957033088"/>
Token of Truth Speaking, and he that did it deceit∣fully was counted more detestable than if he had sworn. <HI>page</HI> 28. (Mark) did they not then esteem Swearing detestable? Again in page 29. cites <HI>Quint. Curt. in Vit Alex.</HI> What the <HI>Scythians</HI> (also a Great Peo∣ple) said to <HI>Alexander,</HI> upon the occasion of an expect∣ed Security, thus, Think not that the <HI>Scythians</HI> con∣firm 'their Friedship by Oath; they Swear by keeping 'their Word. And we find <HI>Chrysostom</HI> saying, That before <HI>Abraham's</HI> time, which was about 2000 Years after the Creation, there was not an Oath; and then Queries, <HI>Whence then came in an Oath?</HI> and answers, 'When Evils increased, when all things became topsy turvy, when they inclined to Idolatry, then verily, when they appear'd unfaithful, they call'd God to witness, as giving Surety for security for their words &amp;c, <HI>page</HI> 83. However, were they more or less that in <HI>Paul's</HI> time, or since that, did or do swear, the Question is not what men did, or now do, but what the Lord &amp; Saviour of men has commanded to do, which is, <HI>Not to Swear at all.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Objest.</HI> 2 Christ forbids only swearing by the Creature, as by Heaven &amp;c. but not by the true God.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> It seems then that Christ forbidding to Swear by the Heaven, forbad to Swear by the true God: for he that Swears by Heaven, Swears by the Throne of God, &amp; by him that sits thereon which surely is the True God. <HI>Matt.</HI> 23 22.

<P><HI>Euthymius. &amp;c.</HI> aforesaid, upon the Question, <HI>If an Oath be of the Devil, how did the old Law permit it?</HI> answers, Because the Sacrifices of Living Creature were also of evil, yet the Law Permitted them, because of the Infirmity of the <HI>Hebrews</HI>▪ for whereas they were glut∣tonous and Smell-Feasts, they lov'd the Sacrifices of I∣dols; and whereas also they were unbelieving, they also lov'd an Oath, and that they should not afterwards either Sacrifice or Swear by Idols, the Law permitted them to Sacrifice and Swear. <HI>page</HI> 118</P>

If he be one that fears God, he will not lye, though he be not sworn, but if he be one that do's not fear God, he cannot speak Truth though he be sworn. — Again because we so little trust one another, we seek God for a Surety. — He is in the same Crime who receives an Oath, if he draw God to be a Surety, &amp; say, <HI>That he will not Trust except he have Him.</HI> O Monstrous thing! O shameful Disgrace! Thou a worm, dust and ashes, and a vapour, doest thou snatch thy Lord (who art such an one) for a Surety, and Compellest to accept him? Tell me if a fellow Servant should say to your Children, striving among them selves and not trusting one another <HI>Unless the Common Master become</HI> a <HI>Surety There is no Trusting</HI> Would not many stripes be in∣flicted? — Tell me, thou halest a man to an Oath What do'st thou seek? Wouldest thou have him to

Forswear? — It were better to lose thy Means, than that he should be lost.</Q>
<Q><HI>Object.</HI> But I expect that he may not Forswear.</Q>
<Q>Therefoe believe him without an Oath also.</Q>
<Q>But there are many, say they who without an Oath 'dare Defraud, who with an Oath do not do it.</Q>
<Q>Thou deceivest thy self O Man! A man who has learn,d to Steal, and to wrong a man, will also Trample upon an Oath. — But if he have a Reverence in Swearing, much more in doing unjustly. <BIBL>p. 79.80.81 83.</BIBL></Q>
<P>And <HI>Erasmus</HI> saith, <HI>A Good man will believe a man without Swearing, and he that is Naught will not trust a man though he swear: Again whosoever dares be bold to Lie without swearing he dares do the same also when he swear∣eth, if he List.</HI> page 131.</P>
<P><HI>Otho Brunfelsius</HI> on <HI>Matt.</HI> 5. saith <HI>But thou wilt say</HI> I shall not be trusted unless I Swear.— <HI>But such Distrust ought not to Reing in the Faithful; but if we trust not words, what should an Oath do?</HI> It is a proverb, <HI>None is less Trusted than he which shall often swear.</HI> page 114.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">On Matt. 5. page 43.</NOTE><HI>Enthymius,</HI> aforementioned brings a Question, <HI>What then it to be done if any require an Oath, yea, compel to swear?</HI> and answers, <HI>Let the fear of God be more forcible than this Compulsion.— And Chose rather to suffer all things, than to transgress the Command.—Unless thou Esteem the Command of God more forcible, all things wilt depart from thee, void and unperform'd</HI> page 118.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">On Matt. 5 Page 23.24.</NOTE>Jacobus Faber says <HI>Perhaps also there is a danger when an Oath is required in Judgment lest he that Exacteth it Sin: for if it be manifest that he that is called into Judg∣ment be verily Good and true, it is enough to hear of him</HI> Yea or Nay, <HI>but if that be not Evident, or that it be Evi∣dent

<P><HI>And Bishop Gauden beforementioned says,</HI> That neither a true Christian and Good Man need be Compelled to swear, in order to the Awing him into Truth telling, not is ill M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n's Swearing of much Credit.</P>
<P>Note how near this late Bishop agrees with the above Authors, especially <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> who argues of a man, that if he fear God he will not Lie, though not sworn, but if he fear not God he will Lie tho' sworn. &amp;c.</P>
<P>And as <HI>Isodorus</HI> saith, If he be a Liar he will lie tho he swear. And as <HI>Erasmus</HI> saith, Whosoever dares be bold to lie without swearing he dares do the same also when he sweareth, if he list. (as before)</P>
<P><HI>Our last Instance is the</HI> Waldenses, <HI>who were reputed to have continued uncorrupted with the Grosness of the A∣postacy ever since the Apostles times; they were defended by Bishop</HI> Usher, <HI>in his Book</HI> de Successione, <HI>but Persecuted by the Papists; one Article Charged against them was</HI> That they would not Swear at all. <HI>page.</HI> 110</P>
<P><HI>As from the foregoing it's evident, that the Fathers held it to be according to Scripture that Swearing by the true God was lawful under the Law to keep them from swearing by Idols, yet no ways lawful under the Gospel consequently no Part of God's Worship or as</HI> Suarez <HI>hath it No Religious Act; And the Scriptures no where say that</HI> Christ <HI>swore nor</HI> Paul <HI>swore nor that it was in common Conversation only, or by the Heavens</HI> &amp;c. <HI>that our Lord forbade to Swear: So also according to the Judgments and Testimonies of the aforegring many cited Fathers, Martyrs &amp; Learned Protestants that tho' Swearing was allowed under the Law, yet not under the Gospel in any Case, neither with, nor with∣out

swearing by the Name of the Lord nor with, nor upon a Book, nor that we should be compelled before a Judge, or o∣therwise to Swear; nor did they make the least Exception to Court Oaths, or of taking them before Authority, but abso∣lutely forbidding to compel any to Swear, this must respect Magistrates, because none else have Power to compel to swear: nor that Christ nor Paul did swear nor that there is the expected Security in Swearing, but that, as</HI> B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>za <HI>hath it, on</HI> James 5.12.

<P>Upon which we Conclude and say, first, This we are Satisfi'd is according to the Doctrine of our Bles∣sed Saviour, and therefore Necessary to be kept to: what remains we also deem very needful to speak to, and indispensibly Necessary to be kept and performed by all, as they tender the Honour of God, doing Justice to their Neighbour, true Peace to their Consciences, and the everlasting Happiness of their Souls, &amp; that is as <HI>Erasmus</HI> hath it. <HI>As often as You Confirm any thing, Con∣firm it with all your Heart, and perform indeed the th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng that you speak: at often as you deny any thing deny it with your whole Heart; neither let any else be in your Heart, than your mouth speaketh, that there be no Counterfeiting in you &amp;c. page</HI> 131.</P>
<P>Under the Law it was, <HI>Thou shalt perform unto the Lord thine Oaths</HI> Matt. 5 34 Under the Gospel it is, <HI>Swear not at all but speak every man Truth with his Neigh∣bour.</HI> Matth. 5 34. Ephesians 4.25.</P>
<P>But since notwithstanding what our Friends have offered, there is still pleading a necessity for Oaths; we

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT</HEAD>
<P>There is a Great Controversie in the World about Re∣ligion, &amp; it is much among them that are called Christians: yet we find in the Scriptures, which we all say we believe, how that the Christians in the primitive Times were all of one accord <HI>Acts</HI> 2.1. And that the Multitude of them that believed were of one Heart &amp; of one Soul <HI>Acts.</HI> 4.

32. What is the matter now? or how comes it to pass that there is such a Split among Christians now?</P>
<P>The New Testament saith, There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither Bond nor Free, there is neither Male nor Female; for they are all one in Christ Jesus, see <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.28.</P>
<P>Here is plain Scripture Testimony where the Oneness is, tho' several Nations, Male or Female, yet all One in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>But now we see many are Professors of Christ Jesus, that are not one; but one against another, every one say∣ing <HI>My Way is Right, &amp; Thine is Wrong.</HI></P>
<P>What shall we do in this Case, to be of one Body? how came the Christians in the primitive times to be of one Body, of one Heart, and of one Soul? Will not the same thing do now, as did then, if we would Receive it?</P>
<P>What is that? (may some say) <HI>It is the Spirit: for by one Spirit were all Baptized into One Body;</HI> whether they were Jews or Gentiles Bond or Free, they were all made to drink into one Spirit, 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.13.</P>
<P>Now if all that profess Christianity, would come to this one Spirit, and so be Baptized by this one Spirit, it would soon end the Controversie.</P>
