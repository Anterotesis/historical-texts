<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>READER, you have now before you, some account of the Life and Death of one, whose eminent piety entitled her to, and obtained her the esteem of all the real lovers of virtue in the circle of her acquaintance.</P>
<P>Had her character as a Christian in <HI>life,</HI> and the circumstances attending her <HI>death,</HI> been as uni∣versally known as they were worthy of admira∣tion, it would have precluded the necessity of this publication; but as this was not the case, it was thought by some of her religious acquaintance, that <HI>a short account</HI> thereof, sent into the world, might be of real service to the enlightened, but too thoughtless and secure inhabitants of Ame∣rica.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="027054_0005_0FD37FDE60302C60"/>But in the execution of this a considerable dif∣ficulty has arisen: no minute being made of her expressions and behavior 'till immediately after her death, many passages, (though highly inter∣esting) are obliged to be omitted, on account of their being so imperfectly remembered by those who were present when such occurrences hap∣pened, that they could not again repeat them with such perspicuity and accuracy as the nature of the case required.</P>
<P>Of the reality of the following account, there are a number of living witnesses; who moreover feel a pleasure in declaring, that such an instance of triumphant <HI>faith</HI> and patient <HI>resignation,</HI> they never before saw in all their lives.</P>
<P>One remarkable instance of her entire resigna∣tion is contained in the following circumstance; which being omitted in the following account, will be the more acceptable here.—One of her brothers (Bennett Maxey) being an itenerant minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church, was travelling and preaching the Gospel at a consider∣able distance from home.</P>
<P>It is extremely natural for those who are leav∣ing the world to wish to see their friends, and espe∣cially those whom they peculiarly esteem. But when she was asked, whether she would have him sent for, she said she wished to see him; but as he
<PB N="vii" REF="027054_0006_0FD37FDFCB838280"/>
was engaged in his Master's work, she did not wish to hinder him; but requested them to tell him to redeem time, and try to meet her in Hea∣ven. And no doubt but the hope she had that they should meet again at the resurrection of the just, enabled her to give up all hope of seeing him again in time. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Her brother, on receiving an account of her death, writes in the following words; which being strongly expressive of their love and union, and of the impressi∣on made on his mind by her pious exhortations to re∣deem time, &amp;c. are here transcribed.
<Q>When I left my <HI>dear sister</HI> I was in great hopes I should have seen her again in time, but am disappointed; and there∣fore think I will take her good advice, and redeem all the time I can.—Time is precious, and my poor heart is too backward to redeem time; but God being my helper, I feel more than ever resolved to do his blessed will.—When I think of the love and union there were between us, I hardly know how to give her up. The pain of parting is great; but I expect the joy will be greater if ever we meet again. So I find a resignation to the will of God.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>The reader will observe, in the course of the following pages, a very remarkable circumstance She had labored for some time under a most pow∣erful temptation; but was at length wonderfully and strangely delivered by a remarkable dream; in which a small ticket appeared to be providen∣tially conveyed to her, containing these words of the apostle John—"Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall
<PB N="viii" REF="027054_0007_0FD37FE1FA890028"/>
be; but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is." These words proved such a source of comfort to her both at the time and afterwards, that she de∣sired and requested that they might be made the subject of her funeral discourse. She had at the same time, such just conceptions of the <HI>value</HI> of <HI>time,</HI> that she also requested a sermon on that sub∣ject might be preached to those that should at∣tend her funeral. Accordingly at the time ap∣pointed, two eminent ministers of God's word, (whom she herself had nominated Mr. James O'Kelly, and Mr. Philip Gatch) solemnized her funeral, in the presence of a vast concourse of people. The one of them preached from the words she had chosen; and the other from Rev. x. 5, 6.
<Q>And the angel which I saw stand up∣on the sea, and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to Heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, that there should be time no longer.</Q></P>
<P>The attentive multitude behaved with great se∣riousness and solemnity. But when her silent re∣mains were consigned to its mother dust, there to rest till the trumpet awakes the dead;—then in an especial manner, the peculiar solemnity of the scene exceeded description.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="027054_0008_0FD37FE370AF6100"/>That the following account may be rendered a blessing to thy soul, O Reader, let me intreat thee to implore the blessing of God upon it. If you will read it with prayer, I think there is lit∣tle doubt, but that virtue will appear amiable, and of course command thy esteem. That you may follow her in the path of duty, to the haven of felicity, is the earnest prayer of</P>

<HEAD>A Short Account OF THE <HI>LIFE AND DEATH</HI> OF THEODOSIA MAXEY.</HEAD>
<P>THEODOSIA MAXEY, the daughter of John and Mary-Anne Maxey, was born in Powhatan County, in the State of Vir∣ginia, on the thirteenth day of June, in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-six. She was remarkable from her very infancy, for her uncommon obedience to her parents, and becom∣ing deportment to the rest of the family; and on all occasions, manifested a mild, gentle, and peace∣able disposition. But as she grew up to maturity, (as it commonly happens) the corruptions of na∣ture grew also. And although she was ever pre∣served from those wicked practices that are com∣mon to youth, yet the customs and vanities of the
<PB N="12" REF="027054_0010_0FD37FE737D63C38"/>
world, so far led her heart astray from God, as to make her careless and indifferent about the salva∣tion of her soul. It is, however, but justice to observe, that very few, while in an unregenerate state, preserve a character so amiable, and a life so free from vice.</P>
<P>For some time she did not appear to have had any other awakenings, than those of an enlightened conscience; nor any other convictions, than those which necessarily arise from the enlightening beams of "That true light which lighteneth every man that cometh into the world"—so that there appeared nothing remarkable in her religi∣ous exercises, till about the 18th year of her age.</P>
<P>About the year 1775, she began to hear the Methodists preach. Edward Dromgoole, Joseph Hartley, Philip Gatch, and others who succeeded them, preached the Gospel through those parts, with considerable success. Her parents were some of the first that were converted to God in that neighbourhood. Their house was opened for the reception of Methodist preaching, where it has been regularly continued ever since. This circumstance tended greatly to increase her oppor∣tunities of instruction; for beside hearing frequent∣ly the word of God in public, she had also the ad∣vantage
<PB N="13" REF="027054_0011_0FD37FE8B3B7E610"/>
of being much in the company of those worthy characters who preached it, and of hear∣ing their private instructions: a priviledge for which many will have cause eternally to bless God.</P>
<P>Nothing however, of a religious nature, seems to have made any lasting impression on her mind, till about the beginning of the year 1785. It was then that Mr. <HI>J. Major,</HI> after preaching at her father's, earnestly intreated her to "try and save her soul;" and after some other plain and pointed conversation took his leave of her with saying, "If you perish your blood will be upon your own head." These words (which carried convictions with them) appeared to be spoken with great simplicity and godly sincerity: and a consciousness of their truth with a fear of their being dreadfully verified, deeply affected her, and created such an alarm in her conscience, that thence forward she could not rest till the Lord spake peace to her soul.</P>
<P>In consequence of the convictions she now re∣ceived, her mind became very resiless and uneasy. A firm persuasion that she was a sinner against God;—An awful apprehension of his just displea∣sure; and a hope that there was yet mercy for
<PB N="14" REF="027054_0012_0FD37FEAF0C4D530"/>
her, fixed in her a determination to take the preacher's advice, and try to save her soul.</P>
<P>We do not intend to give a particular account of the whole progress of her convictions from this time. There were some circumstances, however, which had a powerful tendency to deepen and increase those convictions; a brief account of which, will, we trust, be pleasing, instructive, and entertaining to the reader.</P>
<P>Religion, about this time, was at a very low ebb. Many of those who embraced it, some years before, were now called from this to a better world.—The preaching of the Gospel had appa∣rently very little effect:—The then rising gene∣ration were thoughtless and prophane;—and though many attended the preaching of the word, yet the seed sown fell mostly by the <HI>way side,</HI> and but few brought forth fruit to perfection, and adorned the profession of Christianity. Such was the State of things, when God, jealous for his own Glory, was pleased to revive his work in the following manner.</P>
<P>Elisha Maxey (a brother of Theodosia) in the month of <HI>June</HI> 1785, was powerfully awakened and converted to God. He was one evening
<PB N="15" REF="027054_0013_0FD37FEC79FDAC30"/>
importuned by his father to pray in the family: for a few moments he hesitated; but casting his care on God, he began the first public prayer he ever offered to a throne of grace. He had utte∣red but few words, when the Spirit and power of God, was displayed in a very extraordinary manner. Deep convictions seized several of the family, who till then had remained careless and unconcerned; but were now constrained to cry out aloud for mercy. <HI>Theodosia</HI> was then present, and sunk to the floor under the powerful opera∣tions of the spirit of God. Her strong cries and tears, plainly discovered the agonies of her wounded soul; and her convictions from that time appeared to be greatly deepened.</P>
<P>That a gracious work was now begun, and hap∣pily going on, in Mr. Maxey's family, was now very evident. Seriousness and solemnity marked their countenances, while sighs and groans fre∣quently burst from their disconsolate hearts; and the very breathing of their souls appeared to be after God; and, "What shall I do to be saved?" was the important question. As they were thus earnestly inquiring the way to Zion, <HI>Elisha</HI> (the young man above mentioned) did all in his pow∣er to point them to Christ, as being both able and willing to save; and his labours are not in
<PB N="16" REF="027054_0014_0FD37FEDFA945A68"/>
vain. <HI>Prayer-meetings</HI> were instituted, and the work began to spread far and wide like fire among dry stubble. Numbers attended the prayer meet∣ings: preaching also was wonderfully blest: con∣victions were frequent, deep, and lasting; and it was not uncommon to see several souls converted at a common prayer-meeting. The work soon spread into other neighbourhoods and counties, yea into distant parts; till at length great part of the state seemed to catch the sacred flame, so that hun∣dreds in a short time were brought to enjoy the favour and love of God.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this beginning the work soon after spread through Virginia and the southern states, like a migh∣ty torrent bearing down all before it.—When we re∣flect bow this work began —the instruments employ∣ed in carrying it on,—and its progress in spite of all opposition —we are constrained to say "This was the Lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the great and good effect, which these things had on Mr. Maxey's family, (and Theodo∣sia in particular) is what principally demands our observations at present. She continued for some time truly and heartily engaged with God. Her sighs, tears and secret groans, were an incontesti∣ble proof that she was hungering and thirsting after righteousness: but unbelief kept her from laying hold on the promise. In this distressed
<PB N="17" REF="027054_0015_0FD37FEFC704A950"/>
state, she went mourning from day to day, without comfort, without peace, and sometimes almost without hope!</P>
<P>But God who wounds with an intent to heal, dropt a cordial into her bitter cup. Her mind was deeply impressed with those encouraging, and soul refreshing words of our Lord, (Matt. xi. 28.) "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." These words gave her some ease of mind, and were the ground of a hope, that God would in his own good time, give her the rest she so greatly de∣sired.</P>
<P>During this her great distress, she spent much of her time in private retirement, searching the scriptures and wrestling with God in prayer. Having on a certain time retired into a private room for those purposes, she chanced to read the passage above mentioned. After pondering for some time on the words, she withdrew, leaving the book open at the place. Just about that time Mr. D— had an appointment to preach at her father's; and having occasion to go into the same room, found the book in the posture she had left it. On looking therein he was at once struck with a view of the words, and a sense of their
<PB N="18" REF="027054_0016_0FD37FF4C78EFB78"/>
importance; and after a few minutes' meditation therein, made them the subject of his discourse that day in public. The word was applied to her heart, her hopes were strengthened, her desires increased, and she appeared more resolutely deter∣mined to persevere in seeking the fulfilment of the promise to her soul.</P>
<P>But finding at length, that notwithstanding all her endeavours, her prayers, tears &amp;c. she (like one of old) was nothing mended, but rather grew worse, she determined to add <HI>fasting</HI> to the other means of grace. This she found recom∣mended both by precept and example in Scrip∣ture; and by those now whom she had reason to believe were the real children and lovers of God. Hoping therefore to find some relief from this, she entered upon it without delay: But she soon found this was not the help she needed. At length after making every shift, and using every means in her power, she became fully convinced,
<Q><L>"The blood of Christ must still remain,</L>
<L>"Sufficient and alone."</L></Q></P>
<P>Instead therefore of getting relieved of her bur∣den, it se<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d daily to increase. Being thus beaten out of all dependence on means, she was at last experimentally taught the important lesson
<PB N="19" REF="027054_0017_0FD37FF6AD12BA10"/>
she had been so long striving to learn; and gi∣ving up every plea, came to Christ, as "a weary, heavy laden sinner." She had long labored as in midnight darkness, and drank the wormwood and the gall: her sins for some time had pressed heavily upon her; but now unbelief, like a moun∣tain seemed to crush her down: In this distress and bitterness of soul she attended the prayer meeting,
<Q><L>"Burden'd with a world of grief,</L>
<L>"Burden'd with a sinful load,</L>
<L>"Burden'd with this unbelief,</L>
<L>"Burden'd with the wrath of GOD."</L></Q>
But her extremity was God's opportunity. At this prayer meeting she was enabled to act faith; the chains and fetters of unbelief dropped off, and her soul burst into the liberty of the chidren of God: Her sorrow and distress vanished in a mo∣ment, and joy and peace took possession of her heart. Her mouth was filled with praises, and her tongue loosed to tell what God had done for her soul. Old things were done away, and all things became new, and a new song put into her mouth, even praise to God.</P>
<P>Indeed the praises of God were now her daily employ, and she never appeared happier than when engaged in this heavenly exercise. She
<PB N="20" REF="027054_0018_0FD37FF979D688A8"/>
frequently sang with transport the following words,
<Q><L>"Now I'll sing of Jesu's merit,</L>
<L>"Tell the world of his dear name;</L>
<L>"That if any want his Spirit,</L>
<L>"Jesus is the very same;</L>
<L>"He that asketh soon receiveth;</L>
<L>"He that seeks is sure to find;</L>
<L>"Come—for whosoe'er believeth,</L>
<L>"He will never cast behind."</L></Q></P>
<P>In this happy frame she continued for some¦time, a living witness that "God has power on earth to forgive sin." And the happiness she found in religion during this period, appeared too great for words to describe: she seems to have consoled herself with the pleasing (though delu∣sive hope, that her enemies were all destroyed, and she should learn war no more. But experi∣ence soon taught her otherwise, and the corrup∣tions of nature with the temptations of the Devil, convinced her of her mistake. Evil tempers and dispositions, the remains of the carnal mind, be∣gan to struggle for the ascendency, and she found herself surrounded with enemies before she was aware! By consulting her experience, she found this was not a state of rest, but of war and con∣flict; and that she consequently needed the whole
<PB N="21" REF="027054_0019_0FD37FFAB1E0AD40"/>
armour of God; otherwise her enemies would prevail, and her latter end be worse than the beginning. While these considerations taught her the necessity of a deeper work of grace, a conviction that it was her privilege, set her to seek∣ing it. She found great encouragement from these, and the like portions of Scripture—"His name shall be called Jesus, for he shall save his people <HI>from</HI> their sins:"—"that he was mani∣fested to <HI>destroy the works of the Devil:</HI>" that he has promised to "sanctify his people <HI>wholly,</HI> body and soul and spirit; and to preserve them <HI>blame∣ess</HI> unto life eternal:—and above all—"that he also is <HI>faithful</HI> who has promised, who also <HI>will do it.</HI>" And as she sought the Lord for the pardon of her sins, so she did for a destruction of the car∣nal mind with all her heart.</P>
<P>From August, 1785, till the 5th day of April, 1786, she earnestly and perseveringly sought the Lord for this blessing. Then it was that her prayers were heard and answered in a very ex∣traordinary manner, before a number of witness∣es; some of whom to the present day, retain a lively remembrance of that solemn scene. The servent agonizing manner in which she wrestled
<PB N="22" REF="027054_0020_0FD37FFC3B97F758"/>
with God, is not easily expressed. Her mortal part, at length, unequal to the task, sunk under the conflict, and remained for some time almost motionless; but the aspiring soul would take no denial; till at length, like Jacob, she became a prevailer. In a word, such an instance of active, persevering and prevailing faith, we may venture to say is rarely to be met with.</P>
<P>From this time forward, she appeared to dwell as in the suburbs of Heaven, and lived a witness that even here, "the blood of Christ cleanseth from all sin." Her conduct and deportment was truly becoming the Christian character, and the service of God was her delight. She cheerfully submitted to difficulties, crosses and disappoint∣ments, in order to attend the worship of God, and the ministry of his word: and she used to ex∣press her wonder and astonishment that so many who had an opportunity of hearing the word of God, would nevertheless continue careless at home, and spend that precious time in vanity that they might have spent in the service of God. This was far from being the case with her, for she would neglect no opportunity, but at all times appeared desirous to wait on God in the use of all
<PB N="23" REF="027054_0021_0FD37FFE1BD1C7C8"/>
his appointed means; and so she continued, a wor∣thy member of society, and pattern of piety till God saw good to call her from this vale of tears to reap those incorruptible joys that are at his right hand for ever more.</P>
<P>About two years before her departure, the symptoms of a consumption were first dis<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>rable. A dry tickling cough, the wearing away of the flesh, a quick pulse, shortness of breath, &amp;c. seemed to portend her approaching dissolution. As her bo∣dy weakened, and the disorder increased, her soul ripened apace, for the eternal reward. Relying on the word of him who has promised, that "All things shall work together for good to them that love God;" She did not appear to dread her ap∣proaching change, but resigned herself into the hands of God: and when she was asked, if she dreaded death? would reply, "I have a hope be∣yond the grave!"</P>
<P>After a variety of means had been used to check the disorder without the desired effect; she was advised about August 1792, to use the waters of a mineral spring. The person at whose house she stay<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hile she used these waters, writes thus:
<Q><PB N="24" REF="027054_0022_0FD38000B4C37A10"/>During her stay with us, she appeared truly devoted to God, and spent much time in pri∣vate retirement. She had daily an intermitting fever, and her cough, at times, was very trou∣blesome; Yet her countenance discovered a se∣renity and tranquility of mind, that death (though apparently not far off) could not take from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> And although she was generally se∣rious, and solemn, yet she never discovered the smallest symptom of that alarming dread that seizes the sinner,</Q></P>
<P>"When life sinks apace and death is in view;"
<Q>but on the contrary, appeared to enjoy an un∣interrupted composure of mind, and soul re∣signed to the will of Providence.</Q></P>
<P>While she continued to use the waters above mentioned, she thought she found relief; but on her return home she grew worse, and was confi∣ned soon after mostly to her bed. Death now stared her in the face! And no doubt but the grand enemy of souls tried to represent it to her view in all its ghastly forms. But she had been
<PB N="25" REF="027054_0023_0FD3800264756B78"/>
long accustomed to view death as a vanquished enemy; No wonder then that,
<Q>"Death could not make her soul afraid."</Q></P>
<P>She could rejoice at the prospect of her ap∣proaching dissolution, and would often s<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Not my will, but thine be done, O Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></P>
<P>During the fall and beginning of winter, her disorder gained ground very fast, and her body weakened accordingly; in consequence of which she could sit up but little: Her cough also was very troublesome, and considerably disturbed her rest; but instead of murmuring at any of the dis∣pensations of Providence, she bore all her suffer∣ings with a christian-like patience, and entire re∣signation to the Divine will.</P>
<P>On Wednesday <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> After lying for some time in a thoughtful posture, she addressed herself to her mother who sat by the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> side, and said, "I shall have three hard <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and then I shall go." And accordingly the next day, be∣ing,</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="027054_0024_0FD380048F4A17D0"/>Thursday the 21st. Her spirit seemed to be uncommonly depressed; and the strong and live∣ly hope that she had hitherto enjoyed, seemed al∣most taken away. From what cause this distress arose, we cannot positively affirm; but from what happened the next day, there is reason to believe she was tempted to doubt her being one of the children of God.</P>
<P>Friday, 22. She appeared to labour still un∣der the same distress. One asked her if she was afraid of death? She replied, "I think at times I am not so fearful of it as I ought to be."—From this it appears that her mind was in some degree beclouded, so that she durst not consider herself entitled to the great and precious promises made to the children of God. But he who permits the trial of his people, can, when it pleases him, wonderfully and strangely deliver them: An in∣stance of this we have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> before us. After she had struggled <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the temptation, she fell into a doze. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> awaking, she said,
<Q>I have been dreaming I had stepped out of doors, and as I returned, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a small piece of paper lie on the floor, which I took up, and found on it these words, <HI>Beloved, now are we the sons of God.</HI>—
<PB N="27" REF="027054_0025_0FD38007298C5A40"/>
But the rest</Q>
said she "I cannot remember." She desired her brother to take the scriptures and search, and see of he could find such a passage there. He presently found it in 1 John iii. 2. The whole passage is as followeth,
<Q>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</Q>
The words when read to her, seemed to remove her fears; she again took courage. Indeed it appears as if this was a singular providence of God to communicate comfort to this afflicted saint, in this hour of dark∣ness and distress.</P>
<P>Saturday 23. She said
<Q>Mamma, can you give me up?</Q>
Her mother said, "Yes my child, if it is the will of God!" She then asked for her father and put the same question to him. She said,
<Q>I feel as if I am going to heaven, and I want you to meet me there.</Q>
She exhorted him to redeem time; "Precious time!" said she; and desired him to tell her brothers to redeem time, and meet her in glory, for she did not think he should stay here long.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="027054_0026_0FD380092F7A6B40"/>Her parents expecting her departure was near, sent for two of their sons and families. When they arrived she reached them her hand, saying
<Q>Here they come! I wish I may see you all come so into heaven.</Q>
One of her brothers asked her how she was? She said
<Q>Poorly in body, but happy in soul! Jesus is sweet in affliction; and his love is wonderful;—stronger than death.</Q>
She then requested them severally to try to meet her in glory, and on their promising they would; she thanked God for the hope she had of meeting with them again,
<Q><L>"Where death shall all be done away,</L>
<L>"And bodies part no more."</L></Q>
She exhorted the children to be dutiful to their parents; and above all to try and save their souls. Then exerting her little strength, addressed her∣self to the bystanders in general, and intreated them to persevere; and pressed the necessity of holiness, and a diligent use of the means of grace, with such forcible language and melting expressi∣ons, as drew tears from their eyes in abundance. One of those present, speaking of this solemn dis∣course says "I think it will never be forgotten; it was truly loud preaching to me!"</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="027054_0027_0FD3800DE79F3FE0"/>Sunday, 24th. She lay still and said but little. The few words, however, that dropped from her lips, were weighty and powerful, administer∣ing grace to the hearers.</P>
<P>Monday, 25. Was nearly as the day be∣fore.</P>
<P>Tuesday 26. She complained a little of her mouth and throat, which were very sore. To those who came to sit up with her in the evening she spoke most feelingly and affectionately on the necessity of holiness; and earnestly exhorted them to meet her in heaven. Observing one who made no profession of religion, she took him by the hand and intreated him to seek the salvation of his soul. Nor would she let him go till he gave her a promise that he would fulfil her request.</P>
<P>Wednesday 27. The enemy of souls again thrust sore at her. She was now tempted to think she had offended God by impatience; and so powerful was this temptation that it destroyed her peace, and brought her to the border of des∣pair. To one of her brothers who visited her in this distress, she said, "Brother, I have waded
<PB N="30" REF="027054_0028_0FD38011218B5378"/>
through deep waters since I saw you, and still I fear I have not been enough resigned to the will of God." He told her this was the travail of a christian, and encouraged her to look to God for deliverance. He instanced the case of David, who, when the waves and the billows went over him, cried out, "Why art thou cast down, O my soul, and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him." But she could take no comfort from this, for the cloud still hovered over her mind. In the even∣ing many people came and offered their service to sit up. She thanked them and said, "I hope the Lord will reward you for your kindness." And then intreated them in the most endearing and affectionate manner to seek the salvation of their souls; "For if I should miss of heaven (said she) I want you to get there." From this it appears that she was not yet freed from the temp∣tation above mentioned. Her great resignation when so violently attacked by the devil is peculi∣arly observable: For, when asked by one which she would chuse, life or death, she said "I will chuse neither; the will of the Lord be done."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="027054_0029_0FD3801202215D48"/>Thursday 28. She lay very still in the morn∣ing, said she felt very weary, and her throat ve∣ry sore: she was likewise so hoarse that it was with difficulty she could be understood. The ene∣my in the mean time plied his fiery darts: and a fear that she should miss of heaven at last, plun∣ged her into the depth of distress:—But he, who permitted the trial of holy Job, and faithful Abra∣ham;—that delivered Daniel in the lion's den, and Jonah in the whale's belly;—now saw good to rebuke the tempter, and once more set her soul at liberty.</P>
<P>About 12 or 1 o'clock the cloud was dispelled, the darkness dispersed, her fears and doubts re∣moved, and heavenly light restored. The spirit of the Lord came upon her, his glory shone round her, and heaven sprang up in her soul. Her mourning was now turned into joy, her hea∣viness into happiness and her sorrow to songs of praise. She began to exhort the family, encou¦raging and persuading them to press on, and secure their eternal happiness. She told them of the goodness of God; and the more she spake of his goodness, the more of it seemed poured down into her soul, till all her powers seemed lost in wonder, love and praise.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="027054_0030_0FD3801374CF0B00"/>At length reaching forth her trembling hand, she said, "I want my dear sister;" and taking her by the hand, said farewell! you are my on∣ly sister;—observing her sister to be bathed in tears, she said, "Weep not for me, for I feel as if I am going to glory, and I want you to meet me there." She then took leave of her father and mother in the same manner; then of the rest of the family; leaving this charge with them all, "Try to meet me in glory." To her bro∣thers she said, "Take care of your children, and bring them up in the fear of God; and don't forget to tell your other brother (who lived at a distance and was not present) to do the same by his." Then turning to some of the neighbours who were present, intreated them to meet her in glory, and then bid them all an affectionate fare∣well.</P>
<P>She then lay still a while: but the nearer she approached the heavenly Jerusalem, the more lively and clear her views were, of the glory of the place. New discoveries, and still more glo∣rious prospects, seemed to open to her view; and her triumphant soul appeared to want nothing but wings: Indeed she seemed insensible of her great weakness, and with a strength of voice that was truly astonshing, cried out, "Jesus is come,
<PB REF="027054_0031_0FD38014F1FAF7B8"/>
and the glory of God shines brighter than I ever saw it before. Why will you not help me to praise him? O that all my neighbours were here, that I might tell them how good Jesus is." She would extend her arms and say, "The door of mercy is yet open! Come, come for yet there is room! and the Lord is willing to save your souls." Thus she continued for a considerable length of time, rejoicing—praising God—and exhorting the people. The solid, weighty and melting ex∣pressions, which dropped from her lips at this time:—the deep and genuine piety that they breathed:—the affectionate and pathetic man∣ner in which she delivered them:—and the cheerfulness of her countenance during the whole time; were enough to strike conviction into the hardest hearts. She continued happy all the af∣ternoon, but her bodily strength failed; and she lay still calmly resigned, and cheerfully submissive to her fate.</P>
<P>Observing in the evening, among those who came to visit her, some whose states she feared were dangerous; she did not sail to tell them "That she feared for their souls!" And earnest∣ly intreated them to seek and serve God. To one who asked her how she was? she replied "poorly in body, but happy in soul! I wish <HI>you</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="027054_0032_0FD3801683976F00"/>
could say so: you are a kind man, and have done me many favours, and never denied me one: I have still one more to ask, and hope you will not deny me that:—It is that you will try to save your soul?" This last, important, and dying re∣quest he durst not deny, but promised he would; which appeared to give her much satisfaction. To another she said "Now is the time! and it is ve∣ry precious therefore redeem time and prepare for eternity."</P>
<P>These her dying requests, 'tis to be hoped were not in vain. Some good effects have already ap∣peared, and we trust that when her sleeping dust shall awake she will find some, who through her importunate intreaties, were prevailed on to seek and serve God, and will in consequence arise with her to a glorious immortality.</P>
<P>Friday March 1. The soreness in her mouth and throat increased: and although she was a remarkable instance of patience and resignation, yet at all times she complained a little of this; though not from a murmuring or discontented principle, for these were strangers to her breast.</P>
<P>The springs of life now sink apace, and the aw∣ful symptoms of approaching death, discover
<PB N="35" REF="027054_0033_0FD38017F16D2708"/>
themselves! What can be so desirable in such a situation, as an assurance of the favor of God? This assurance she had been favored with the pre∣ceding day in a very uncommon manner. But how dreadful the thought of losing this in times of the greatest extremity? This, however distressing, appears to have been the case: For, as she infor∣med one, "she waded through deep waters for some hours." But the God whom she served was able to deliver her, and would not suffer her to be carried away of the flood. For although like one of old, "the waters might come in to her ve∣ry soul, yet was it for her good that through suf∣fering she might be made perfect:
<Q><L>"That power at whose command the thunders roll,</L>
<L>"Curbs the wild storm, and bids its fury cease;</L>
<L>"Can whisper comfort to the labouring soul,</L>
<L>"And hush its sorrows into lasting peace."</L></Q></P>
<P>When, therefore, he whom the winds and the seas obey, shall speak the word, all will be peace.</P>
<P>Saturday 2. After this severe storm had last∣ed for some hours, He who has power to say, "Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further, and here shall thy proud wave be stayed," <HI>He</HI> said, "<HI>Peace! be still:</HI> and, indeed, there was a great calm." She then dropped into a doze, and ap∣peared
<PB N="36" REF="027054_0034_0FD38019B18CEBD8"/>
to enjoy comfortable rest in sleep for some time. When she awoke, she said to her mother, "I want you to breakfast early," and being told that they had breakfasted, she said very well." Her mother asked, "what do you want, my child?" She replied, "I told you I should have three hard struggles, and then I should go: they are over." Her mother said, "Do you dread death?" She said "not at all." After lying still for some time, she said, "I feel strange; but I don't think I shall die to day." This appeared strange to those present; one of whom says, "we were expecting every moment to see her depart." She then closed her eyes and appeared to doze, but soon after burst into raptures of praise, saying, "wonderful, wonderful! Why don't you help me praise God?" She then asked for a little water, to wash her mouth, that she might, as she said, "be the better enabled to praise God."</P>
<P>She seemed, (during the time she appeared to doze) to have a view of, and communion with some of the blessed inhabitants of the celestial world! This will not appear strange when we consider that "they are <HI>ministering spirits,</HI> sent forth to minister to the heirs of salvation." She had passed through many severe conflicts, and had
<PB N="37" REF="027054_0035_0FD3801CCAC53B90"/>
happily weathered the storms: Her <HI>patience</HI> had been sufficiently proved; and her <HI>faith</HI> like gold seven times tried. She was now just entering the conflict with her last enemy, "<HI>the King of Terrors</HI>:" And as she had stood firm hitherto, her merciful and heavenly Father would not now forsake her; for "right precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints." <HI>He,</HI> there∣fore, who has promised to be with his people, in, and through the valley of the shadow of death, no doubt commissioned a convoy of these minister∣ing spirits to earth, with the pleasing and welcome news, "That her warfare was accomplished, her trials at an end, and her soul called to receive its reward. Indeed, it appears as if she was per∣fectly sensible, that such a message was arrived, for she said with an audible voice, and with a pleasing cheerful countenance, "Don't leave me, I will go with you." Which abundantly mani∣fested that the sting of death was quite destroyed, and her soul ripe for a glorious immortality.</P>
<P>After taking a little refreshment, she desired the company present to sing an hymn. She desi∣red a book might be brought to her, and chose herself the following words, which they sung, and she, though her voice was extremely weak, joined with them in the praises of her great de∣liverer.
<PB N="38" REF="027054_0036_0FD38021F680F8F0"/>
These being the last words in which she ever attempted to attune the praises of God here below, we take the liberty of transcribing them.</P>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>1.</HEAD>
<L>"O joyful sound of Gospel grace,</L>
<L>"Christ shall in me appear:</L>
<L>"I, even I shall see his face;</L>
<L>"I shall be holy here.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<HEAD>2.</HEAD>
<L>"The glorious crown of righteousness,</L>
<L>"To me reach'd out I view;</L>
<L>"Conqueror thro' him I soon shall seize,</L>
<L>"And wear it as my due.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>3.</HEAD>
<L>"The promis'd land from Pisgah's top,</L>
<L>"I now exult to see;</L>
<L>"My hope is full, (Oh glorious hope!)</L>
<L>"Of immortality.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>4.</HEAD>
<L>"He visits now the house of clay;</L>
<L>"He shakes his future home:</L>
<L>"O would'st thou, Lord, on this glad day:</L>
<L>"Into thy temple come."</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>5.</HEAD>
<L>"Come, O my God, thyself reveal!</L>
<L>"Fill all this mighty void:</L>
<L>"Thou only canst my spirit fill:</L>
<L>"Come, O my God, my God!</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>6.</HEAD>
<L>"Fulfil, fulfil, my large desires,</L>
<L>"Large as infinity!</L>
<L>"Give, give me all my soul requires,</L>
<L>"All, all that is in thee!"</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="39" REF="027054_0037_0FD38025995A5F28"/>Whoever considers the above words attentive∣ly, cannot but observe how peculiarly applicable they were. They appear to be the language of a soul standing on the border of eternity, looking over the narrow sea, death; and viewing, by faith, the glories of the place, of which the earthly Canaan was only a type. She appeared earnestly to desire to drop the clay tenement, and and to be with Christ, which is far better.</P>
<P>After they had done singing the hymn, she continued rejoicing and talking of God's good∣ness for some time, then dropped into a doze, and slept calmly for about one hour; she then awoke with a shortness of breath, and frequent∣ly said "Lord have Mercy on me." When ask∣ed what she wanted, she would say, "rest." The pangs of death were now strong upon her, but she would frequently say,
<Q><L>"My suffering time will soon be o'er,</L>
<L>"When I shall sigh and weep no more."</L></Q></P>
<P>Being asked by Mr. G—, how she was? replied, "Happy in God, and entirely resigned to his will." What a comfort it is, (said one) to have such an assurance! She said "Wonderful!, Wonderful!" One taking her leave of her said
<PB N="40" REF="027054_0038_0FD38026634ACE28"/>
"God bless you my child; if I never see you more on earth, I will try to meet you in heaven." She said "where parting will be no more," and soon after slept in Jesus, and her spirit went to rest, in the 27th year of her age.</P>
<P>Thus lived, and thus died that humble and de∣vout follower of her Lord, a remarkable instance of faith and patience. But—O reader thou al∣so must die! This dreadful debt thou must sure∣ly pay! Art thou prepared, or art thou yet a sinner? Resolve this question before it is too late. Dreadful! horribly dreadful will it be to die without real religion! The many hard strug∣gles this young woman encountered will clearly evince, that death is no trifling thing! Then to prevent a miserable death, take her advice,— follow her example,—and seek God with all your heart; So shall you die the death of the righteous, and your last end shall be like her's.</P>
