<HEAD>A LETTER From an Eminent Minister in the Church of Scotland: written to a Minister of his Acquaintance at some distance in the same Kingdom.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend and Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY desire and intension in this Letter is to inform you what the Lord has lately done for my soul: In order to this, it may be needful to give you a little previous information of my manner of life from my youth up, to the present time.</P>
<P>When I was about the age of fourteen, God was pleased to shew me that I was a sinner, and that I must be born again before I could enter into his kingdom. Accordingly, I betook myself to reading, praying and watching; and was enabled hereby to make some pro∣gress in sanctification. In this manner I went on, tho' not always with the same diligence till about half a year ago. I thought myself in the right way to heaven, though as yet I was wholly out of the way; and ima∣gined I was travelling towards Sion, though I had ne∣ver yet set my face thitherwards. Indeed God would have shewn me that I was wrong, by not owning my ministry, but I had no regard to this for a long time, imputing my want of success to the haughty hearts of my hearers, and not to my naughty doctrine.</P>
<P>You may ask, perhaps, What was my doctrine?
<PB N="2" REF="012832_0003_0F8B404C611A3A58"/>
Why, dear Sir, it was the doctrine that every man will naturally hold whilst he continues in an unregenerate <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, viz. that we are to be justified partly by our faith, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by our works. This doctrine I preached for eight years, and though I took some extraordinary pains, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sanctification upon the people very <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yet they continued as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sanctified in their hearts, and unholy in their lives, as before. There was indeed a little more of the form of religion in the pa∣rish but not a <HI>whit</HI> more of the <HI>power</HI> Just after I had preached eight years in this manner, I began to be discouraged; and now some secret misgivings arose in my mind that I was not right myself. This happened about six months ago. Those misgivings grew stron∣ger, and at last, very painful. Being then under great doubts, I cried unto the Lord very earnestly. The constant language of my heart was this—"Lord, if I am right, keep me so; if I am not right make me so Lead me to the knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus."</P>
<P>After about ten days crying unto the Lord, he was pleased to return an answer to my prayer, and in the following wonderful manner. As I was sitting in my house one morning, and musing upon a text of scrip∣ture, the following words were darted into my mind with great power, and seemed, indeed, like a voice from heaven, (viz.) <HI>Cease from thy own works,</HI> before I heard these words, my mind was in a very unusual calm; but as soon as I heard them, my soul was in a tempest directly, and the tears flowed from my eyes like a torrent. The scales fell from the eyes of my understanding immediately, and I now clearly saw the rock I had been splitting on for near thirty years.</P>
<P>Do you ask what this rock was? Why, it was some
<PB N="3" REF="012832_0003_0F8B404C611A3A58"/>
secret reliance on my <HI>own works</HI> for salvation. I had hoped to be saved, partly in my <HI>own</HI> name, and partly in <HI>Christ</HI>'s name; though I am told there is salvation in no other name except in the name of Jesus Christ, Acts iv. 12. I had hoped to be saved partly through my own works, and partly through Christ's mercies; though I am told we are saved by grace through faith, and not of works, Eph. ii. 7, 8. I had hoped to make myself acceptable to God, partly <HI>through my own good works,</HI> though we are told that we are accepted thro' the beloved, Eph. i. 6. I had hoped to make my peace with God, partly through my own obedience to his laws, though I am told that <HI>peace</HI> is only to be had by faith, Rom. v.i. I had hoped to make myself a child of God by [legal] sanctification, though we are told, that we are made children of God by faith in Christ Jesus, Gal. iii. 26. I had thought that Regene∣ration, the new Birth, or the new Creature consisted in this legal sanctification, but now I know it consists in faith, 1 John v. 1.—Compare also these two pas∣sages together, Gal. vi. 15.—and Gal. vi. 5.—where you will find that the new creature is <HI>faith working by love</HI>; the apostle adds these words, <HI>working by love</HI>; in order to distinguish a <HI>living</HI> faith from a <HI>dead</HI> one. I had thought that sanctification was the way to justi∣fication, but now I am assured that sanctification fol∣lows after justification; or in other words, that we must first be justified by faith before we can have any true sanctification by the Spirit. When we are justi∣fied it is done <HI>freely,</HI> that is, graciously without any the least merits of ours, and solely by the grace of God through Jesus Christ, Rom. iii. 24—28.</P>
<P>All that is previously needful to justification, is this, that we are convinced by the Spirit of God of our own
<PB N="4" REF="012832_0004_0F8B404D8D24D670"/>
utter sinfulness, Isa. lxiv. 6.—Convinced that we are the children of wrath by nature, on account of our Birth-sin, Eph. ii. 3.—And that we are under the curse of God on account of actual sin, Gal. iii. 10.—And under these convictions come to the Lord Jesus Christ, renouncing all righteousness of our own, and relying solely on him, who is appointed to be "the Lord our righteousness," Jer. xxiii. 6. Again, Christ says, "Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, (with the burden of sin) and I will give you rest," i. e. I will take the burden away, I will release you from the guilt of sin. Where you may observe, that the only thing required of us when we come to Christ, is to come burdened and sensible that none can remove this burden but Christ. Again, Christ did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. See also Luke iv. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Hear how he cries out in Isa. lv. 1. "Ho e∣very one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters and drink, come buy wine and milk (i. e.) the blessings of the Gospel) without money and without price." Where we are ordered to bring no money, i. e. no merits of our own, we must not think to make a purchase of these blessings by any deserts of ours. They are offered freely, i. e. graciously, and must be received freely. Nothing more is required of us than to thirst after them. Why was the Pharisee rejected? [Luke xviii. 10.] Because he came pleading his own works before God He was devout, just, chaste and abstemious; and thanked God for enabling him to be so. Very well; so far all was right. But then he had some re∣liance on these works, and therefore pleads the merits of them before God; which shewed that he did not know what a sinner he was, and that he could only be saved by grace through faith. He opens his mouth be∣fore
<PB N="5" REF="012832_0004_0F8B404D8D24D670"/>
God, and pleads his own cause; though God de∣clares that every mouth shall be stopped before him, and the whole world brought in guilty before God, Rom. iii. 19. And why was the Publican justified? Not on account of his own good works, but because he was sensible of his evil ones; and accordingly came self-accused, self-condemned, and crying out for mercy.</P>
<P>And now dear Sir, hear what is the rise and pro∣gress of true religion in the soul of man. When the Spirit of God has convinced any person that he is a child of wrath, and under the curse of God, [in which state every one continues to be, till he has received Je∣sus Christ into his heart by faith,] then the heart of such a one becomes broken for sin; then, too, he feels what he never knew before, that he has no faith: and accordingly laments his evil heart of unbelief. In this state men continue some a longer, some a less time, till God is pleased to work faith in them. Then they are justified, and are at peace with God, Rom. v. 1. i. e. have their sins forgiven them, for that is the meaning of the word, <HI>peace.</HI> See Luke vii. 48,—50. —When we have received faith from God, [for it is his gift, Eph. ii. 8.] to justify our persons, then we afterwards receive the Spirit to sanctify our natures, Eph i 13.—Gal. iii. 14. And now the work of [gospel] sanctification goes forwards; now his fruit is more and more unto holiness; now the love of God is shed abroad in his heart by the holy Spirit, Rom. v. 5. Now he walks in the comforts of the holy Ghost, Acts ix. 13. Now he is filled with joy and peace in believ∣ing, Rom. xv. 13. Now he rejoices with joy un∣speakable and full of glory, 1 Pet. i. 8. And now he has the Spirit of God bearing witness with his own spirit, that he is a child of God, Rom. viii. 16. 1 John
<PB N="6" REF="012832_0005_0F8B404DE3A726C8"/>
v. 10.—These are things which I was an utter stran∣ger to before, notwithstanding all my reading, watch∣ing and praying; and these are things that every one must be a stranger to, till he is made a child of God by faith in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>But to proceed; though a believer is continually more and more sanctified, "in body, soul and spirit," yet his hopes of heaven are not built on his sanctificati∣on, but on Christ; he knows he is only complete in Christ, Col. ii. 10. And that the moment he seeks to be justified by his own obedience to God's law, that moment he falls from Christ and ceases to have an in∣terest in him, Gal. v. 4. Accordingly, though he la∣bours to abound in all the fruits of righteousness, yet, like St. Paul, he desires to be found only in Christ, not having [i. e. not relying on] his own righteousness, but on the righteousness of God by faith, Phil. iii. 8, 9.</P>
<P>And now let me point out to you the grand delusi∣on, which had like to have ruined my soul. I saw ve∣ry early something of the unbelief of my nature, and the necessity of being born again. Accordingly I watch∣ed, prayed and fasted too, thinking to purity my heart by these means, whereas it can only be purifyed by faith, Acts xv 9. Watching, praying and fasting are neces∣sary duties, but I, like many others, placed some secret reliances on them, thinking they were to do that for me, in part at least, which Christ only could. The truth is, though I saw myself to be a sinner, and a great sinner, yet I did not see myself an utter lost sin∣ner, and therefore I could not come to Jesus Christ a∣lone to save me; despised the doctrine of justification by faith alone, looking on it as a foolish and a danger∣ous doctrine; I was not yet stript of all my righteous∣ness, could not consider it as "filthy rags," and there∣fore
<PB N="7" REF="012832_0005_0F8B404DE3A726C8"/>
I went about to establish a righteousness of my own; and did not submit to the righteousness of God by faith, Rom. x. 3 —I did not seek after righteous∣ness through faith, but, as it were, by the works of the law. Thus I stumbled and fell, Rom. ix. 31, 32. In short, to use a homely similitude, I put the justice of God in one scale, and as many good works of my own as I could in the other, and when I found, as I always did, my own good works not to be a ballance to the divine justice, I then threw in Christ as a make-weight. And this every one really does, who hopes for salvation partly by doing what he can for himself, and then relying on Christ for the rest.</P>
<P>But, dear Sir, Christ will be either a whole Saviour, or none at all. And if you think you have any good service of your own to recommend you unto God, you are certainly without any interest in Christ. Be you ever so sober, serious, just and devout; you are still un∣der the curse of God as I was, and know it not, pro∣vided you have any allowed reliance on your own works, and think they are to do something for you, and Christ to do the rest.</P>
<P>I now proceed to acquaint you with the success I have lately had in my ministry. As soon as God had opened my eyes, and shewed me the true way to sal∣vation, I began immediately to preach it And now I dealt with my hearers in a very different manner from what I used to do. I told them very plainly, that they were children of wrath and under the curse of God, though they knew it not, and that none but Jesus Christ could deliver them from that Curse. I asked them if they had ever broke the law of God once, in thought, word or deed? If they had, they were un∣der the curse: For it is written, "Cursed is every one
<PB N="8" REF="012832_0006_0F8B404F740667B8"/>
that continueth not in all the things that are written in the book of the law to do them." And again, "he that keepeth the whole law, and yet offendeth in one point, is guilty of all." If, indeed, we could keep the whole law, without offending in one point; if we had done, and could continue to do all things in God's law, then we might lay claim to eternal life on the score of our own works. "But who is sufficient for these things?" If we break God's law, we immediately fall under the curse of it, and none can deliver us from this curse but Je∣sus Christ. There is an end for ever after, of any jus∣tification from our own works. No future good be∣haviour can make any atonement for past miscarriages. If I keep all God's law to day, this is no amends for breaking them yesterday. If therefore I am once un∣der the curse of God, for having broken God's law, I can never after do any thing of myself to deliver me from this curse. I may then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, "O! wretched man that I am, who shall deliver <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from this body of sin?" And find none able to deliver, but Jesus Christ, Rom. vii. 24, 25. So that if I am once a sin∣ner, nothing but the blood of Jesus Christ can cleanse me from sin. All my hopes are then in him, and I must fly to him as the only "refuge set before me."</P>
<P>In this manner, dear Sir, I preached, and do preach to my people, labouring to bring them off from self-righteousness to a dependance on Christ's righteousness only for justification, in the sight of God: labouring to shew them that they were all in a lost and perishing state, and that nothing could recover them out of this state, and make them children of God, but faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. And now see the consequence. This was strange doctrine to my hearers. They were sur∣prized, all armed and vexed. The old man, the car∣nal
<PB N="9" REF="012832_0006_0F8B404F740667B8"/>
nature was stirred up, and railed and opposed the truth. However, the minds of most were seized with some convictions, and the hearts of some were truly broken for sin, so that they came to me, as those men∣tioned in the Acts, 'pricked to the heart,' and crying out, "What must I do to be saved?" I then laid the promises before them, and told them, if they found themselves under the curse, Christ was ready to deliver them from it; if they were really weary and heavy laden, Christ would give them rest; if their hearts were broken for their sins, and they would look up unto Christ he would heal them. I exhorted them also to thank God for these convictions, assuring them it was a token of good to their souls. For God must first smite the heart before he can heal it, Isa. xix. 22. I generally found that they received comfort from the promises of God in his word; and though they com∣plained much of the burden of sin, and of an evil heart of unbelief, yet they always went away refreshed and comforted. The good fruits begin now to appear, not a few rejoice in Christ and love him; they love his word, and meditate in it; they exercise themselves in prayer, and adorn their profession by a suitable life and conversation.</P>
<P>And now let me make one reflection. I preached up sanctification very earnestly as (as above mentioned) for eight years, and never brought one soul to Christ, never had success at all; but as soon as ever I preached Jesus Christ, and faith in his blood, then conviction of sin took place in the hearers hearts, yea, and believers were, every now and then, added to the church And now let me ask, what is the reason why my mi∣nistry was not blessed, when I preached up salvation partly by faith, and partly by works? It is because
<PB N="10" REF="012832_0007_0F8B4051775AAB68"/>
this doctrine is not of God; and he will prosper not ministers but such as preach salvation in his own ap∣pointed way, [viz] by faith in Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Let me now apply myself to your own heart, and may God dispose you to receive my words in the spi∣rit of meekness. Indeed, Sir, I love and respect you, else I could not have wrote to you so freely. Are you then in the same error that I was in for near forty years, [viz] that you must be saved partly by faith, and partly by works? And have you constantly preached this doctrine? Then you may be certainly assured of these two things; first, that you never yet brought one soul to Christ, by your ministry. And secondly, that you are not yet in the way of salvation yourself. Oh! be not displeased with me for telling you the truth.—But you will say perhaps, that you have not only been sin∣cere, but ever zealous in preaching the word of God. So was I; but there is a zeal which is not according to knowledge, and that zeal I had, though I knew it not. You may say farther, that you have read and prayed much, so have I, but still 'I knew nothing as I ought to know,' till God was pleased to shew me that I was blind, and then I cried heartily to him for light and di∣rection, and he opened mine eyes, John ix. 39.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, will you attend to the following advice? it is very safe advice, be the state of your soul what it will. Pray to God to lead you into the knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus. Beseech God to keep you in the truth, if you have received it; or if you are in er∣ror, to reveal it unto you If you will do this heartily and constantly, God will not suffer you to abide in darkness, if, indeed, you are in darkness, Jam i. 5.</P>
<P>I now proceed to give you some account of myself, and of the impediments which kept me from the truth.
<PB N="11" REF="012832_0007_0F8B4051775AAB68"/>
When I first went to the College, I applied myself di∣ligently to my studies, thinking human learning to be the chief, if not the only necessary qualification for a divine. Accordingly I studied the Classics, Mathematicks, Ethics, Logics, Metaphysics, and read the works of our most eminent Divines; and this I did for twenty years; and all the while was departing more and more from 'the truth as it is in Jesus;' vainly hoping to receive light and instruction from human wisdom, which could on∣ly be had from the word and Spirit of God.</P>
<P>During this time, I was thought one of the true mi∣nisters of Christ by some people, only because I was a little more grave, and took a little more pains in my ministry than some others of my brethren; but, in truth, I was not, I was an utter stranger to the doc∣trines of their master, which they preached as well as to Christ himself in my heart and could not abide the doctrine of justification by faith, in particular. But when God was pleased to open mine eyes about half a year ago, he shewed and taught me other things. Now I saw that nothing had kept me so much from the truth, as a desire of human wisdom. Now I perceived that it was as difficult for a wise or learned man to be saved, as it was for a rich man; or nobleman: 1 Cor. i. 26. Now I saw that God even still chose the fool∣ish things of this world to confound the wise, and the weak things to confound the mighty, for two plain reasons, 1st, that no flesh should glory in his presence, ver. 29. and 2d. to shew that faith did not stand in or was not produced by the wisdom of man, but by the power of God, 1 Cor. ii. 5. Now I discerned, that no one could understand the word of God, but by the Spirit of God, 1 Cor. ii. 12. Now I saw that every be∣liever in Christ was anointed by the holy Spirit of God,
<PB N="12" REF="012832_0008_0F8B40521ED3B558"/>
and thereby led to the knowledge of all needful truths, 1 John ii. 20. Now I saw that Justification by faith alone was a fundamental doctrine of christianity; and did no longer wonder at the want of success in those ministers who did not preach this in particular, and the other fundamental doctrines of gospel. They preach∣ed not Christ's doctrine, and Christ owned it not. I once neither believed nor preached Justification by faith only, yea, what was more dreadful, I was undermining this fundamental doctrine, and yet dreadful as this is, I fear it is the case of too many of the clergy in this kingdom. Scarce any thing is preached but justifica∣tion by faith and works, at best. And what is the con∣sequence? Why there is scarce any true religion a∣mong us, the gospel of Christ is not truly preached by us, and Christ will not own our ministry. Look around the Parishes which are near you, and see whether you can find any thing besides the form of religion, and not much of that. Nay, amongst those who are thought religious people; who are sober, serious, just and de∣vout; who read and pray, and give alms, and even fast; amongst these you will scarce find one who knows any thing of the power of religion, and has experimental knowledge of it. For if you ask such people in the very words of scripture, "whether they know that Je∣sus Christ is in them, otherwise they are reprobates," 2 Cor. xiii. 5. Whether Christ dwells in their hearts by faith, Eph. iii. 17. Whether their sins are forgiven for Christ's sake, John ii. 12. Whether they have re∣ceived an unction from the holy One, 1 John ii. 20. Whether the love of God has been shed abroad in their hearts by the holy Ghost, Rom. v. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Whether they are filled with joy and peace in believing, Rom. xv. 13. Whether they walk in the comfort of the holy Ghost,
<PB N="13" REF="012832_0008_0F8B40521ED3B558"/>
and do ever rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory, Acts ix. 31. 1 Pet. i. 8. And lastly, whether the Holy Spirit bears witness with their own spirit that they are the children of God, Rom. viii. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4. &amp;c. If, I say, you ask the better sort among us, whether they have any experience of these matters. they would stare at you with the utmost amazement, and would think you an Enthusiast, if they did not call you so. Or, at most, they would have expected to be enquired at ra∣ther about the orthodoxy of the head, than about these experiences which reside in the heart alone, as being fuller of that than the other. Now such people who are only orthodox, and such who have all the form, but none of the power of religion, who are outwardly reformed but not inwardly renewed by the Holy Ghost. These last are what our Saviour calls "whited sepul∣chres," beautiful without, but full of rottenness with∣in; these are "striving to enter into the kingdom of heaven, but are not able," because they do not "strive lawfully:" for they do not seek to enter in through Je∣sus Christ, but partly through Christ, and partly thro' themselves, partly by faith, and partly (if not wholly) by works, and they first make a Christ of their ortho∣doxy, make it to be 'all in all,' to supply the place of heart-Religion and holiness of life. And even when these two<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orthodoxy and outside Religion.</NOTE> are found joined in any, it makes them but almost christians. And if at any time it happens, that some are seized with deep convictions, and are made sensible of their utter need of Christ, and that they can only be justified by faith in his blood; these not find∣ing proper food for their souls from one minister, are obliged with those people who have from time to time been brought into the same state of soul, to go and hear another that preaches the true gospel, where they can
<PB N="14" REF="012832_0009_0F8B405261206090"/>
find him. This is often the case, so scarce are gospel ministers nowadays. It is no wonder therefore that there are so few real christians. If you read the fathers of the church, if you read the works of our good old reformers, and works that were published a hundred years ago, you will there find the gospel of Christ preached, and the true doctrines of Protestants. But since that time, I mean in the last Century, the clergy, especially of the church of England, have been gradu∣ally departing more and more from this gospel and those doctrines; so that at length there were few clergymen to be found in England but who preached contrary to them. And almost all the sermons that have been published in the last century,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Meaning the same as referred to in the last note.</NOTE> are full of that soul-de∣stroying doctrine, that we are to be justified either partly by our own works, and partly by Christ's merits, or by the former only.</P>
<P>Do you ask how the clergy came to fall into this pernicious doctrine? I answer very easily. Every man, whilst he continues under the power of the carnal mind and is not awakened to see his utter lost condition, is naturally disposed to embrace this doctrine. For not being yet convinced by the Spirit of God, that all his righteousness is as filthy rags, Isa. lxiv. 6. And that he is without help and strength in himself, Rom. v. 6. I say, not being convinced of this, he naturally goes a∣bout to establish some righteousness of his own, and can∣not submit to the righteousness of God by faith. Not being yet sensible of his utter lost and helpless state, he must have some reliance on himself. And thus instead of looking wholly to Jesus Christ for salvation, he looks partly to Christ and partly to himself: instead of seek∣ing for righteousness and strength from the Lord Jesus Christ, he seeks for it partly from Christ and partly
<PB N="15" REF="012832_0009_0F8B405261206090"/>
from himself: instead of seeking to be justified in the Lord, he seeks after justification partly thro' the Lord, and partly through himself. But see what Christ saith of this matter, Isa. xlv. 23, 23, 24, 25, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now let me ask, how the whole church of Rome happened to depart from the simplicity of the gospel, and to fall into this doctrine of works, which we [the clergy of the church of England and Scotland] now preach. It was owing to the depraved nature of man, which makes him think himself to be something and can do something, though he is nothing and can do no∣thing to justify himself in God's sight. At the refor∣mation those churches returned again to Jesus Christ, and pleaded justification on the gospel-footing of faith only. And so it continues: but though their Articles [and our confession of Faith] continue sound and evan∣gelical in this doctrie, [and are in every other doctrine, at least, that is essential to salvation, agreeable to the word of God;] yet their and our clergy have departed once more from them, and are advancing to Rome a∣gain in this particular, with hasty strides; preaching in spite of Articles or Confessions and subscriptions, that most pernicious, Papistical, and damnable doctrine of Justification by faith and works. Which doctrine, I am verily assured no one can hold, and be in a state of salvation. Oh, that God would once more visit in mer∣cy these poor distressed Churches!</P>

be his mercy: may he lead you by his Spirit to "the knowledge of the truth as it is in Jesus;" and make you instrumental in bringing souls "from darkness in∣to light," and "translating them out of the kingdom of Satan, into the glorious kingdom of his dear Son." AMEN.</P>
