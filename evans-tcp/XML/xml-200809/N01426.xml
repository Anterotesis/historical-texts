<HEAD>THE OCCASION.</HEAD>
<P>TO pay an Honour unto a MOTHER, yea, and make the Memory of them to <HI>Live,</HI> in whom we received our <HI>Life;</HI> 'Tis what a <HI>Roman</HI> would practise: Even a <HI>Roman</HI> would make a Funeral Ora∣tion for a <HI>Mother,</HI> especially one whom he could boast, that he <HI>had never been reconciled unto:</HI> And therefore, it can∣not be, that a <HI>Christian</HI> should Re∣proach it: Even a <HI>Solomon</HI> himself was not the Less of One, for the Respect he paid unto his <HI>Mother.</HI></P>
<P>Mine Expired in the Night when the Fourth of <HI>April,</HI> which was the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> was coming on: and retired unto her <HI>everlasting Rest.</HI> It was not fit I should let that Day go over, without Entertaining my Neighbours with a SERMON; which is here exhibited in Things, &amp; in Terms also, as near as may be, to what was then delivered. And certainly a Prepara∣tion of but a <HI>few Hours,</HI> bears but a little Pro∣portion of Time for a Requital of the Com∣forts received for more than <HI>half an Hundred of Years;</HI> and invites the Reader also to look for but a very mean Performance.</P>
<P>I Remember, that <HI>Roquetaillade,</HI> (or, <HI>De Rupe scissa'</HI>) wrote a little Book, which is by the Author styled, a, <HI>Librunculus,</HI> of this Title, <HI>Vade Mecum in Tribulatione.</HI> I am sure, such <HI>Consolations</HI> as are here offered, will suit every Christian, and ought to be his, <HI>Vade Mecum,</HI> in every <HI>Tribulation.</HI></P>

<P>GLORIOUS Things are to be done for the CHURCH of God in the latter Days. And especially for that People which for many Ages was the only Church of God in the World: His <HI>Peculiar;</HI> which for Ages not a few, has been <HI>Repudiated</HI> by the Lord, Rejected, Scattered, and <HI>cut off by Un∣belief;</HI> which in the Ages coming on, is to be Converted, &amp; Restored, &amp; set on the <HI>top of the Mountains,</HI> with <HI>all Nations flowing</HI> unto it. <HI>Glorious Things are spoken of thee, O thou City of God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001693_0004_0FB5296A168559B0"/>
The Noble Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> under the Inspirations of God, is in the Chapter, and Context now before us, as well as elsewhere, employed as the <HI>Herald,</HI> by whom these <HI>Excellent Things</HI> which the Lord will do, are so Proclaimed, as to be <HI>known in all the Earth.</HI> These <HI>Excellent Things</HI> are Ex∣hibited under the Term of, <HI>Consolati∣ons.</HI> But then, that the <HI>Consolations</HI> may be described as <HI>exceeding Comfortable,</HI> there is a Metaphor used, which car∣ries the Tenderness of the <HI>Comforter,</HI> beyond all Expression. Our most Gra∣cious GOD, is pleased variously to express His <HI>Love</HI> to His People, and His <HI>Care</HI> of them: He has <HI>used Simi∣litudes</HI> for it, and this in a most Ele∣gant Variety. Among these, <HI>Herein God commendeth His Love to us,</HI> that He not only assures us, Psal. CIII.13. <HI>Like as a Father pittieth his Children, so the Lord pitties them that fear Him:</HI> He also gives us this Assurance, <HI>As a Mother Comforteth her Children, so will I Comfort them.</HI> Yea, I can tell where the Matter is carried further than so; He so Endears Himself unto His Peo∣ple;
<PB N="5" REF="001693_0004_0FB5296A168559B0"/>Isa. XLIX.15. <HI>Can a Woman for∣get her Sucking Child, that she should not have Compassion on the Son of her Bowels? Yea, They may forget; yet will not I for∣get thee.</HI> Oh! The Endearments of our God! Beyond all the Endear∣ments of the Tenderest <HI>Mother</HI> in the World!</P>
<P>The <HI>Consolations</HI> which the People of God find in Him, are here com∣pared, First, unto those which the Child has from the <HI>Mother,</HI> while in a state of <HI>Infancy:</HI> The <HI>Consolations</HI> of the Infant, <HI>Sucking at the Breast of Con∣solations, carried in the Arms, dandled on the Knees of the Mother.</HI> But in the Verse now before us, the Compari∣son for the <HI>Consolations</HI> goes on, to those which a <HI>Man</HI> receives from his <HI>Mother.</HI> I have the Original on my side, in so mending the Translation; <HI>As it is with a MAN whom his Mother Comforteth.</HI> One Reason for it may be, Because a <HI>Mother</HI> who sees a Son grown to be a <HI>Man,</HI> and prove a Wor∣thy and an Useful and a Noted <HI>Man,</HI> and one that is to her, as they said unto <HI>Naomi, The Restorer of her Life,
<PB N="6" REF="001693_0005_0FB5296C585CD100"/>and the Nourisher of her old Age;</HI> Her Affection to such a Son, will be very Passionate, very Rapturous, very Marvellous, nothing will be equal to the Transport of it. A <HI>Mother,</HI> when she has in her Sight, a Son that is a Valuable <HI>Man,</HI> and a Rich <HI>Harvest</HI> of all her painful and anxious <HI>Nursery,</HI> she places a violent Affection on him; such, that no Tongue is able to utter it! She thinks no <HI>Consolations</HI> too much for a <HI>Son,</HI> that affords her such <HI>Con∣solations.</HI> They who take Notice of such Things, tell of a Nation in <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> above others Remarkable for this Quality in the <HI>Mothers</HI> there, <HI>Prae alijs Matribus mire Filios suos Grandevos amant.</HI> However, our God has a Kind∣ness for us, which exceeds that of such a <HI>Mother.</HI> There is also this Rea∣son for it; Our God is concerned for the Welfare of His People, not only in their more <HI>early Days,</HI> but also <HI>all their Days. When Israel was a Child, then I loved him,</HI> says the Lord; yea, and so He will in the Riper and La∣ter Years of His People. <HI>Having loved thy own, Lord, Thou wilt Love them to
<PB N="7" REF="001693_0005_0FB5296C585CD100"/>the End, and without End!</HI> Particular Saints find it so; The <HI>seventy first Psalm</HI> contains their Story, and is fulfilled unto them. I have thought of one Reason more for it. The Church will be arrived unto <HI>Mans Estate,</HI> and and unto <HI>Manly Christianity,</HI> when this Word shall be accomplished. When the Church is come, <HI>unto a per∣fect Man, unto the measure of the Stature of the fulness of Christ,</HI> then, then shall this have its full Accomplishment. I will add but this one Remark more; Every Believer on the Son of God, may claim an immediate Share in these <HI>Consolations.</HI> Every <HI>Child</HI> of God, in the <HI>Sufferings of this present Time,</HI> has a Claim to these more than <HI>Maternal Consolations,</HI> as well as in the <HI>Glory that is to be Revealed.</HI></P>
<P>My DOCTRINE is now ready for me.</P>
<P><HI>The Consolations derived from the most Affectionate MOTHER upon Earth, do shadow out, and are but a shadow of, those with which the Children of God will find their Heavenly Father Comforting of them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001693_0006_0FB5296DD6AC3300"/>
The Disposition which the Glori∣ous God has to provide for the <HI>Com∣fort</HI> of His People, has Two Resem∣blances, in His <HI>Two Testaments;</HI> And in both of them, 'tis Resembled unto the Provision which <HI>Female-Parents</HI> make for their Young ones. Agree∣ably to the more Sublime and Lofty Dispensation, wherewith our Lord appeared for the delivering of His People, in the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> we read; Deut. XXXII.11. <HI>As an Eagle flutter∣eth over her Young, hearing them on her Wings, so the Lord.</HI> Agreeably to the more Humble and Obscure Dispen∣sation, wherewith our Lord made His Appearance to deliver His Peo∣ple in the <HI>New Testament,</HI> we read; Matth. XXIII.37. <HI>How often would I have gathered your Children together, even as an Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings.</HI> There is a Vehemence in the ΣΤΟΡΓΗ, and Passion of these Animals, to have their Young ones Defended, Befriended, <HI>Comforted.</HI> But that the Disposition in our God for the <HI>Comfort</HI> of His People, may have a yet more lively Emblem given of
<PB N="9" REF="001693_0006_0FB5296DD6AC3300"/>it, Behold, an Emblem found for it in the <HI>Rational</HI> World. As it is with a Man <HI>whom his Mother Comforteth!</HI> Our God is more disposed for to <HI>Comfort</HI> us, and has better <HI>Comforts</HI> for us, than the most Affectionate <HI>Mother</HI> in the World!</P>
<P N="1">I. The first Thing I am to observe, is this. There are considerable <HI>Conso∣lations</HI> enjoy'd by those <HI>whom their MOTHER Comforteth.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Consola∣tion</HI> to have a <HI>Mother</HI> Living. He is a barbarous Wretch, and worthy to have his Eyes pulled out in the <HI>Valley of Car∣eases,</HI> who does not count it so. Tho' it should be a <HI>Decayed</HI> Mother, a <HI>De∣crepit</HI> Mother, one under all the In∣conveniences of a <HI>Superannuation,</HI> and one that must be entirely supported by her <HI>Children,</HI> yet the Presence of their <HI>Mother</HI> with them, is grateful to them if there be not a Barbarity of Ingratitude in the Children. The Jews have a Proverb among them, That a <HI>Mine of Gold</HI> in an House were not so rich a Blessing, as the presence of such a <HI>Mother</HI> there. But then, there are numberless <HI>Consolations</HI> which <HI>good
<PB N="10" REF="001693_0007_0FB5296F569649A0"/>Mothers</HI> give unto their <HI>Children. Mo∣thers</HI> are the <HI>Comforters</HI> of their Chil∣dren. They are by <HI>Nature</HI> so; have a strong Instinct of <HI>Nature</HI> for it; are <HI>Naturally</HI> very desirous to see their Children <HI>Comfortable.</HI> They can't bear to see their Children in any <HI>uneasy</HI> Circumstances. From this <HI>Natural In∣clination</HI> in our <HI>Mothers</HI> to <HI>Comfort</HI> us, how cheerfully do they, while we are yet in our Minority, go thro' many Fatigues, many Troubles, many Self-denials for us? What poor Shifts had we made in our Minority, if we had not had <HI>Mothers</HI> to <HI>Comfort</HI> us? It was required, Deut. XXII.6. <HI>If a Birds Nest chance to be before thee, and there be a Dam sitting upon the Young, thou shalt not take away the Dam.</HI> A <HI>Dam</HI> is ill spared from a <HI>Nest</HI> of <HI>Young ones.</HI> O Young ones, that have had your <HI>Mo∣thers</HI> continued unto you, until you have been brought up to your Maturi∣ty, <HI>Be Thankful;</HI> Be Thankful to a Compassionate God, for all the <HI>Con∣solations</HI> which He has by your <HI>Mo∣thers</HI> bestow'd upon you. Nothing like an <HI>Own Mother!</HI> If she be yet with
<PB N="11" REF="001693_0007_0FB5296F569649A0"/>you, prize her Exceedingly! 'Tis but here and there, that <HI>Mothers-in-Law,</HI> are found <HI>Mothers-in-Love.</HI> Those few that are so, are never enough to be commended! And still, as we <HI>grow up,</HI> the Concern of our <HI>Mothers</HI> to <HI>Com∣fort</HI> us does not <HI>grow Cold.</HI> Our <HI>Mothers</HI> continue their Concern to see us have all sorts of <HI>Consolations,</HI> as long as they continue their Concern to see us have all sorts of <HI>Consolations,</HI> as long as they continue with us. But then, there are some Cases, wherein the <HI>Consola∣tions</HI> we receive in our <HI>Mothers,</HI> are Aggravated, are Distinguished, are Unspeakable.</P>
<P>First. Our <HI>Mothers</HI> unspeakably <HI>Com∣fort</HI> us, when we have <HI>good Instructions</HI> from them. There was a Wise Man, whom his <HI>Mother Comforted,</HI> when he could say, Prov. IV.3. <HI>I was a Tender and only one in the sight of my Mother,</HI> and then follow the <HI>Lessons</HI> from her, that helped him to be what he was. There was another Wise Man, whom his <HI>Mother Comforted,</HI> when there was, Prov. XXXI.3. <HI>The Prophecy that his Mother taught him;</HI> and she told him what must be done by the <HI>Son of her Vows. Mothers</HI> do sometimes contri∣bute
<PB N="12" REF="001693_0008_0FB52970D7B127B0"/>very much unto the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of their Children; yea, do very much to make them <HI>Wise unto Salvation.</HI> The best Thing that some can be advised unto, is, <HI>Forsake not the Law of thy Mo∣ther.</HI> When our <HI>Mothers</HI> teach us our <HI>Catechism,</HI> and nourish our Souls with <HI>the sincere Milk of the Word</HI> of God, and charge us to do Well, and warn us to shun the Paths of the Destroyer, We are those that have our <HI>Mothers Comforting</HI> of us.</P>
<P>Secondly. Our <HI>Mothers</HI> unspeak∣ably <HI>Comfort</HI> us, when we have <HI>good Examples</HI> from them. There was a Minister of God, whom his <HI>Mother Comforted,</HI> when it could be said unto him, 2 Tim. I.4. <HI>The Faith which dwelt first in thy Mother, I am perswaded is thee also.</HI> As there are Children <HI>Ru∣ined</HI> by their <HI>Mothers,</HI> when it may be reported of them, as it was of one; 1 King. XXII.52. <HI>He did Evil in the sight of the Lord, and walked in the way of his Mother;</HI> So a Man is one whom his <HI>Mother has Comforted,</HI> when his best way to do that which is <HI>Right in the sight of the Lord,</HI> is, to <HI>walk in the
<PB N="13" REF="001693_0008_0FB52970D7B127B0"/>way of has Mother.</HI> Have we had <HI>Mo∣thers</HI> who have been <HI>Patterns</HI> of Piety, and of <HI>Hobiness in all manner of Conver∣sation?</HI> In whom we have seen an <HI>Abborrence</HI> of every <HI>Wicked Thing;</HI> a mighty Delight in Conversing with the <HI>Word</HI> of God; Reading over the Bible perhaps <HI>Twice every Year;</HI> a con∣stant Regard unto the <HI>Religion of the Closet?</HI> Yea, with such a Frequency, as no less than <HI>six Times</HI> in a Day. Such as been very <HI>Humble,</HI> in other Things, as well as their <HI>modest Attire;</HI> and very Charitable to the <HI>Poor,</HI> al∣ways <HI>Doing</HI> for them, or <HI>Grieving</HI> for them? If they had any little <HI>Feminine Weaknesses,</HI> yet being <HI>Women that feared the Lord,</HI> that Honourable Character the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> made a full Amends for all; and they were <HI>to be praised for it.</HI> We are those who have had our <HI>Mothers Comforting</HI> of us.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Our <HI>Mothers</HI> unspeakably <HI>Comfort</HI> us when they are continually <HI>Praying</HI> for us. There are <HI>Mothers</HI> who can say to their Children, as in Gal. IV.19. My <HI>little Children, of whom I Travail in Birth again, until Christ be
<PB N="14" REF="001693_0009_0FB529725691B1D8"/>formed in you. Mothers</HI> who are always <HI>Travailing</HI> for the Conversion and Sal∣vation of their Children, with <HI>Suppli∣cations</HI> full of Agony on their behalf; As <HI>Monica</HI> for her <HI>Austin; Mothers</HI> that mention all their Children be∣fore the Lord, with suitable Petitions for them, in their daily <HI>Supplications; Mothers</HI> that if their Children are in any Distress, make their importunate Visits to Heaven for them, in their fervent <HI>Supplications:</HI> Truly, these are <HI>comfortable Mothers.</HI> Perhaps, they have been <HI>Mothers,</HI> that would, very often, very often, set apart <HI>whole Days</HI> for <HI>Prayer</HI> with <HI>Fasting</HI> before the Lord. We may be sure, they Remembred <HI>us</HI> on these Days; It may be, we were the <HI>main Articles</HI> of them. There are <HI>Mothers</HI> that lay up a stock of <HI>Prayers</HI> for their Children; This is to lay up a stock of <HI>Comforts</HI> for them. We read of one, Gen. XXIV.67. <HI>He was com∣forted after the Death of his Mother.</HI> When a Devout <HI>Mother</HI> has been for many Years Praying and Weeping to the Lord for the <HI>Blessings of Goodness</HI> to be multiplied upon their Children,
<PB N="15" REF="001693_0009_0FB529725691B1D8"/>they may be <HI>comforted after the Death</HI> of such a <HI>Mother; Comforted</HI> in this Consideration; <HI>Tho' she be Dead, the Effects and Answers of the Prayers that she made before she dyed, may be Living and Lasting with us!</HI></P>
<P>Thus 'tis, that our <HI>good Mothers</HI> do <HI>Comfort</HI> us. But O Children, How can you do any other then study to be <HI>Comforts</HI> unto such obliging <HI>Mo∣thers?</HI> When you were first Born un∣to them, they expected, <HI>This same shall Comfort us.</HI> Oh! Let them not be disappointed of their Expectations. A <HI>Disappointment,</HI> which will deserve and procure, that you who give it, should Perish Wonderfully! Your <HI>Mothers</HI> even Load you with <HI>Comforts;</HI> and all your <HI>Comforts</HI> are Theirs. Children. Do not you now fill them with <HI>Sorrows;</HI> Oh! Do not bring down their <HI>Gray Hairs</HI> therewith unto the Grave. Be it known unto you; Your Wickedness will fill them, and even kill them with <HI>Sorrows.</HI> You read, Prov. X.1. <HI>A Foolish Son is the Heaviness of his Mother.</HI> And, Prov. XVII.25. <HI>A Foolish Son is a Bitterness to
<PB N="16" REF="001693_0010_0FB529761686B940"/>her that bare him.</HI> Very particularly, All Undutiful, All Rebellious, All Contemptuous <HI>Carriage</HI> towards your <HI>Mothers;</HI> Wretches, I tell you, it will be extremely Grievous to them. The Transgressors of the <HI>fifth Command∣ment,</HI> are called, 1 Tim. I.9. <HI>Mur∣derers of Mothery.</HI> If you don't <HI>Honour</HI> your <HI>Mothers,</HI> you <HI>Murder</HI> them. You had best beware, last you so see pro∣voke your <HI>Mothers,</HI> that they may Pronounce a <HI>Direful Thing</HI> in the An∣guish that you give unto them. Some <HI>Direful Thing</HI> will befall you, if it should be so. The <HI>Direful Thing</HI> will be dreadfully Executed on you. There are <HI>Executioners</HI> that stand always rea∣ly for it! You are worse than the Thievish <HI>Micah,</HI> if the Vengeance of an Irritated <HI>Mother</HI> be nothing with you. I press for the Reverse of this. <HI>Comfort</HI> your <HI>Mothers,</HI> by all possible. Demonstrations of your Affection to them; in speaking to them, in doing for them, all that is <HI>Comfortable. Com∣fort</HI> them with contriving all the Me∣thods imaginable to make their whole Condition <HI>Comfortable. Comfort</HI> them,
<PB N="17" REF="001693_0010_0FB529761686B940"/>with making them the <HI>Glad</HI> Specta∣tors of such a Laudable Behaviour in you, that <HI>their Hearts may Rejoice, even theirs.</HI> Finally, Be of the Per∣swasion, That you never can Retali∣ate the <HI>Consolations</HI> you have received from your <HI>Mothers;</HI> Be perswaded, That you never can do so much for <HI>their Comfort</HI> as they have done for <HI>yours.</HI> Children, <HI>This is Right!</HI> But perhaps there are some of you, whose <HI>Mothers</HI> after Thousands of <HI>Groans</HI> to Heaven for you, yet had not the Sa∣tisfaction of seeing you brought home to God before they Died; They had the Pangs of leaving you in your Sins, in your sinful Impenitency, when they Died. Oh! that the Thoughts of what your <HI>Mothers</HI> underwent for you, may this Day make some Im∣pression on you! Oh! that you would this Day resolve, <HI>I will no longer Delay what my Dear Mother Died so exceedingly wishing to have me brought unto!</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. But I must pass on to a Second Observation. <HI>Temporal Consolations</HI> must not be too long dwelt upon. God for∣bid, that <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> should be the
<PB N="18" REF="001693_0011_0FB5297796A24FC0"/>chief of our <HI>Consolations.</HI> The <HI>best Re∣latives,</HI> who Dwell in <HI>Houses of Clay,</HI> will not long yield us any <HI>Consolations.</HI> Nor do they ever yield us our <HI>best Con∣solations. Nulli fit Injuria cui Deus prae∣ponitur.</HI> It is no Disgrace cast upon the most affectionate <HI>Mothers,</HI> to say, That we have a <HI>better Comforter</HI> than the <HI>Best</HI> of them. Yea, if we have not a <HI>better</HI> than them, we shall anon find them to be but <HI>miserable Comforters.</HI> We will draw near now to that <HI>better Comforter,</HI> and make this Remark.</P>
<P>The <HI>Children</HI> of God will find their Heavenly <HI>Father</HI> gloriously <HI>Comforting</HI> of them, with <HI>Consolations</HI> beyond what the most affectionate <HI>Mother</HI> upon Earth can give, or so much as wish, unto her Children. <HI>Comfort ye, Comfort ye my People, faith the Lord, speak ye Com∣fortably to them.</HI> The <HI>comfortable</HI> Things we have now to <HI>speak,</HI> are such as these. Our God will <HI>Comfort</HI> His Peo∣ple, His <HI>People</HI> are His <HI>Children;</HI> and therefore He will <HI>Comfort</HI> them. When the good God comes unto the <HI>Comfort</HI> of His Children, 'tis with them, <HI>as with a Man whom his Mother Comfort∣eth.</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="001693_0011_0FB5297796A24FC0"/>In the <HI>Consolations</HI> which an affe∣ctionate <HI>Mother</HI> affords her Children, there is a little <HI>Shadow</HI> of the <HI>Consola∣tions,</HI> which the Blessed God bestows upon His. What are the Points, where∣in our <HI>Mothers</HI> are willing to <HI>Comfort</HI> us? First, All the <HI>Comforts</HI> that come to us from our <HI>Mothers,</HI> do Originally come from GOD. GOD fonds us our <HI>Comforts</HI> by their kind Hands, that indeed love to bring them to us. This <HI>Kindness</HI> in them to us, is also from GOD. GOD has planted it in them, touched them with it. GOD will do for us likewise all that is done by our <HI>Mothers;</HI> and very <HI>Transcendently</HI> so. They <HI>Feed us.</HI> Our Heavenly <HI>Father</HI> gives us the <HI>Bread of Life.</HI> They <HI>Cloath</HI> us. Our Heavenly <HI>Father</HI> gives us the <HI>Garments of Salvation.</HI> They <HI>Guide</HI> us. Our Heavenly <HI>Father</HI> leads us in the <HI>way wherein we should go.</HI> They <HI>keep</HI> us out of Harms-way. Our Heavenly <HI>Father</HI> does <HI>preserve us from all Evil.</HI> They confer <HI>Ornaments</HI> upon us. Our Heavenly <HI>Father</HI> beautifies us with <HI>Jewels of great Price.</HI> They <HI>Comfort</HI> us, with letting us know, that it is a Plea∣sure
<PB N="20" REF="001693_0012_0FB529791680A690"/>unto them to see us. Our Hea∣venly <HI>Father</HI> says to us, <HI>Let me see thy Face, and hear thy Voice; thy Prayer is my Delight.</HI> Yea, all the <HI>Comforts</HI> that our <HI>Mothers</HI> can <HI>wish</HI> for us, are such as our Heavenly <HI>Father</HI> will <HI>give</HI> to us. What they can only <HI>Wish,</HI> He will <HI>Do.</HI> I am still too short in my Lan∣guage; He will <HI>Do</HI> for us, <HI>far Above all that they can Ask or Think for us,</HI> or we for our selves! And there is one <HI>Transcendency</HI> more in the <HI>Consolations</HI> of our God. Our <HI>Mothers</HI> will by'nd by leave <HI>Comforting</HI> of us. <HI>Morta∣lity</HI> will put a Period unto their <HI>Con∣solations.</HI> They are not <HI>suffered to con∣tinue by reason of Death.</HI> But our Hea∣venly <HI>Father</HI> does never Dye; and His <HI>Consolations</HI> do see no <HI>Death;</HI> but will Abide with us, yea, Increase on us, after <HI>Death.</HI> So we read; 2 Thess. II.16. <HI>God, even our Father, has lovea us, and given us everlasting Consolati∣on.</HI></P>
<P>But let us now a little more parti∣cularly Enquire; What are the <HI>more than Maternal Consolations,</HI> wherewith God will <HI>Comfort</HI> His chosen People?</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="001693_0012_0FB529791680A690"/>
First; Each of the Three Persons in the Eternal GODHEAD, is Di∣stinctly and Wondrously at Work, to <HI>Comfort</HI> the People of God. Let us take a View of this Matter, and fall into a just Astonishment at the Con∣templation!</P>
<P>First. God the <HI>Father</HI> will <HI>Comfort</HI> His People. Our Acknowledgement, our Doxology to the Almighty <HI>Fa∣ther,</HI> must be that; 2 Cor. I.3. <HI>Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of Mercies, and the God of all Comfort, who comforteth us in all our Tribulation.</HI> Certainly, we are <HI>com∣forted</HI> by the Infinite <HI>Father,</HI> when He tells us, That He will be our <HI>Fa∣ther. I will be a Father to you, and ye shall be my Sons and my Daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</HI> What is the best of <HI>Mothers,</HI> weigh'd in the Ballance with such a <HI>Father?</HI> Our <HI>Father</HI> is now the Infinite GOD. But, O ye <HI>Adopted &amp; Comforted</HI> of the Lord, what an <HI>Inhe∣ritance</HI> have you a Title to? You shall come to no less a Felicity than this; <HI>To inherit all Things.</HI> Who can Com∣prehend the <HI>Riches of the Glory of that
<PB N="22" REF="001693_0013_0FB5297B568935F8"/>Inheritance,</HI> to which the Saints are Entitled? O the <HI>Consolations,</HI> O the <HI>Con∣solations,</HI> of such an Incomprehensible <HI>Inheritance!</HI> My Brethren, God the <HI>Father</HI> informs you, That He has <HI>cho∣sen you before the Foundation of the World, that you should be Holy and Blameless be∣fore Him in Love.</HI> God the <HI>Father</HI> in∣forms you, That He hath <HI>so loved you, at to give His Only-begotten Son for you, to bring you unto everlasting Life.</HI> If there be any <HI>Comfort of Love,</HI> certain∣ly 'tis in this <HI>Love!</HI> O Children of God, This is the <HI>Comfort, wherewith we are comforted of God!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. God the <HI>Sow</HI> will <HI>Comfort</HI> His People. If a bright <HI>Angel</HI> were now to Preach among you; he would now thus call upon you; <HI>Behold, I bring you good Tidings of great Joy; To you there is born a Saviour.</HI> And he would not stick to add, <HI>Never, never any Comfort came up to this!</HI> The Jew∣ish Rabbi's agreed upon it, That the Name of the <HI>Messiah</HI> should be <HI>Mena∣chem,</HI> or, <HI>The Comforter;</HI> Because 'tis He that is thus called, Lam. I.16. <HI>The Comforter that should relieve my Soul.</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="001693_0013_0FB5297B568935F8"/>We read of such a Thing as this to be forever taken for granted; <HI>Conse∣lation in Christ.</HI> Oh! what a <HI>Comferter</HI> we have in such a <HI>Saviour!</HI> The <HI>Con∣solations</HI> of a <HI>Redeemer,</HI> who is of God made <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and <HI>Holiness,</HI> and <HI>Redemption</HI> unto us! No <HI>Mothers</HI> can do such things for us; nor can it <HI>enter into their Hearts to con∣ceive</HI> all that is in those things. Tru∣ly, Sinners that have the <HI>Wrath of God abiding</HI> on them, and that are <HI>serving diverse Lusts,</HI> and that are held by Sa∣tan in the <HI>Chains of Death,</HI> and are in the way that leads down to a <HI>Devour∣ing Fire, and Everlasting Burnings;</HI> These cannot but be <HI>comforted,</HI> when they hear a Blessed JESUS calling to them, <HI>Look unto me, and be ye saved!</HI> And saying, <HI>Him that comes unto me, I will in no wise cast out!</HI> My Friends, won't it <HI>Comfort</HI> you, to have a <HI>Savi∣our,</HI> who has offered up a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to God for you, and supplied you with a <HI>Righteousness</HI> wherein God will ac∣cept of you? A <HI>Saviour,</HI> who fits on the <HI>Glorious high Throne,</HI> with the Go∣vernment of the whole World in His
<PB N="24" REF="001693_0014_0FB5297CD76BA2D0"/>Hands, and is resolved that in the Administration of His <HI>Providence,</HI> all the Things that befall you, shall <HI>work together for your Good.</HI> What shall I say? A <HI>Saviour,</HI> who is your <HI>Brother</HI> and a <HI>Man</HI> lying in the Bosom of God, and infinitely dearer to God, than all the Works of His Hands? What <HI>Consolations</HI> are these? <HI>O my Soul, Why art not thou even Overwhelmed in these Consolations!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. God the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> will <HI>Comfort</HI> His People. 'Tis indeed His <HI>Office</HI> to be their <HI>Comforter.</HI> We read Joh. XV.26. <HI>The Comforter is the Spirit of Truth.</HI> Surely, we cannot but be <HI>comforted,</HI> when we feel our Minds Purified, Rectified, and brought into an Holy <HI>Order,</HI> &amp; an Heavenly <HI>Tem∣per,</HI> and the <HI>Storms</HI> raised by our Ir∣regular Appetites appeased, and suc∣ceeded with the <HI>Peace of God which passes all Understanding.</HI> We cannot but be <HI>comforted,</HI> when we are satisfied, That our <HI>Sins</HI> are <HI>forgiven</HI> to us, and that our <HI>Souls</HI> are bound up in the <HI>Bundle of Life,</HI> and that <HI>Goodness and Mercy shall follow us all our Days,</HI> and
<PB N="25" REF="001693_0014_0FB5297CD76BA2D0"/>we shall <HI>dwell in the House of the Lord for ever and ever.</HI> None but a God, can give such <HI>Consolations.</HI> But, <HI>Oh! Holy SPIRIT, Thou art God, and these are thy Consolations!</HI></P>
<P>It has been a little Surprising unto me to find, That in some of the Pri∣mitive Writers, the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> is call∣ed, <HI>The Mother. Tertullian</HI> uses this Denomination for the <HI>Holy Spirit;</HI> The <HI>Mother,</HI> who is Invocated with the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son.</HI> The Deno∣mination was justified by this; That we are <HI>Born of the Holy Spirit.</HI> And it has a notable Coincidence with it; That when the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> comes to take a full Possession of the Church, and in doing so, has formed the Hea∣venly City; Then is this Prophecy fulfilled; As it <HI>is with a Man whom his Mother comforteth, so will I Comfort you.</HI> Then the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of God in His Church, will do the part of a <HI>Mother,</HI> in Cherishing the Souls of His Peo∣ple, and <HI>comforting</HI> of them, with God becoming their <HI>exceeding Joy!</HI> A City which is the <HI>Mother of us all,</HI> so inti∣mately possessed by the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="001693_0015_0FB5297E56A2EFE8"/>that He becomes in a manner <HI>One</HI> with it; What <HI>Consolations</HI> will it bring unto us? In the mean time, To be fill'd with the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> is to be always full, full of matchless <HI>Con∣solations!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Promises</HI> in the <HI>Co∣venant</HI> of God, are alsufficient and inexhaustible Springs of <HI>Comfort</HI> unto the People of God. The <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> is a Covenant full of <HI>Consolati∣ons.</HI> Oh! the <HI>Consolations</HI> of the <HI>sure Mercies</HI> laid up in that most <HI>comfortable Storehouse!</HI> Christian, come to the <HI>Co∣venant</HI> of God, as thou wouldest unto thy <HI>Mother,</HI> on all Occasions, in all Necessities. The Lord will there An∣swer thee, as He did the Angel; Zech. I.13. <HI>With good Words, and comfortable Words.</HI> A Servant of God could say, <HI>This is my Comfort in my Affliction; for thy Word has quickened me.</HI> Whatever it be, by which we may be <HI>afflicted,</HI> we may find in the <HI>Word of God,</HI> something by which we may be <HI>comforted;</HI> A <HI>good Word,</HI> which may make the <HI>Heart Glad,</HI> when <HI>stouping with Heaviness.</HI> The <HI>Guilt</HI> of Sin af∣frights
<PB N="27" REF="001693_0015_0FB5297E56A2EFE8"/>us. That Word will <HI>Comfort</HI> us, <HI>The Blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God cleanseth from all Sin.</HI> The <HI>Power</HI> of Lust annoys us. That Word will <HI>Comfort</HI> us, <HI>Sin shall not have Dominion over you.</HI> Furious <HI>Temptations</HI> assault us. That Word will <HI>Comfort</HI> us, Our JESUS <HI>knows how to Succour the Temp∣ted.</HI> We Conflict with <HI>Straits</HI> and <HI>Wants,</HI> or the <HI>Fears</HI> thereof. There is that Word for our <HI>Comfort, They that seek the Lord, shall not want any good Thing.</HI> We are <HI>afflicted and tossed with Tempests</HI> of <HI>Adversity.</HI> We have the <HI>Comfort</HI> of that Word; <HI>Whom the Lord Loves He Chastens, and He Scourges eve∣ry Son whom He receives.</HI> We are be∣reaved of our valuable <HI>Friends.</HI> We have the <HI>Comfort</HI> of that Word; <HI>He hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</HI> O you <HI>feasted Children</HI> of God, What an incomparable Provi∣sion has your Heavenly <HI>Father</HI> made for you? No <HI>Mother</HI> on Earth could have done so for you. <HI>None Comforts like Him!</HI> Oh! Subsist on these <HI>Con∣solations,</HI> and with ravished Souls, often, often make those Exclamati∣ons,
<PB N="28" REF="001693_0016_0FB5297FD686C8E0"/><HI>In the multitude of my Thoughts with∣in me, O my God, Thy Comforts delight my Soul!</HI> This World will not afford any substantial <HI>Comfort</HI> unto us. But from the <HI>Comfort of the Scriptures, we have Hope,</HI> of coming e're long to a <HI>better World.</HI> The <HI>comfortable Scrip∣tures</HI> have told us, of a <HI>Paradise</HI> for the <HI>Spirits</HI> of the Dead, wherein it is said, <HI>They are comforted.</HI> The <HI>comfortable Scriptures</HI> have told us of a <HI>Resurrecti∣on</HI> for our <HI>Bodies</HI> from the Dead, and have said, <HI>Comfort one another with these Words.</HI> From the <HI>comfortable Scriptures</HI> we become apprized of those Hea∣venly Places intended for us, wherein <HI>God shall wipe away all Tears from our Eyes, and there shall be no more Sorrow nor Crying there.</HI> O the <HI>Consolations</HI> of these <HI>exceeding Great and Precious Pro∣mises!</HI> How <HI>exceeding Great and Precious</HI> the <HI>Consolations!</HI> Why are they given to us? We read, Heb. VI.18. It is, that we <HI>may have a strong Consolation.</HI> Take it, O Regenerate Souls; <HI>Eat, O Friends, Drink abundantly, O Beloved ones.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="001693_0016_0FB5297FD686C8E0"/>
But these Things are now waiting for the <HI>Improvement</HI> that we are to make of them.</P>
<P N="1">I. And now, Behold, what we have to <HI>Comfort</HI> us, when our <HI>Desirable Re∣latives,</HI> and even our <HI>Mothers</HI> them∣selves, are taken from us; They which were the <HI>Desire of our Eyes, taken away with a Stroke!</HI> In the loss of <HI>Relatives,</HI> we lose our <HI>Comforters.</HI> And some there∣upon abandon themselves to such an Excess of Sorrow, that they <HI>Refuse to be comforted.</HI> An Error this; Inasmuch as we know where to repair unto one, who tells us, <HI>As it is with a Man whom his Mother Comforteth, so will I Comfort you!</HI> A Sorrow on the Death of a <HI>Mother</HI> is very allowable; Yea, 'tis a Phrase for a very pungent Sor∣row, Psal. XXXV.14. <HI>I bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his Mo∣ther.</HI> But the Sorrow is to be Mode∣rated and Regulated, by the <HI>Consola∣tions of God.</HI> It is to be considered, That it is GOD who gave us our <HI>comfortable Relatives,</HI> and made them to be all that they were unto us. It was GOD, who was the Giver, and
<PB N="30" REF="001693_0017_0FB529839678EA18"/>Author of all that we found <HI>Comforta∣ble</HI> in them. It is to be considered, That when God pleases to call for our <HI>comfortable Relatives,</HI> He does but call for His own; He may do what He will with <HI>His own.</HI> He does it also to bring us unto a more entire De∣pendence on Himself alone, for all that is <HI>Comfortable.</HI> Our other <HI>Comforters</HI> are one after another going from us. But we have a Glorious GOD still to <HI>Com∣fort</HI> us; An <HI>Eternal GOD</HI> still to be a <HI>Refuge</HI> unto us. We are so advised; Psal. CXLVI.3, 4. <HI>Put not your Trust in the Son of Man, in whom there is no Help; His Breath goes forth; he returns to his Earth; in that very Day his Thoughts Perish.</HI> This, this is the Voice of our God unto us, in the Death of our <HI>Comforters;,</HI> Oh! No longer expect
<Q>your <HI>Comforts</HI> from the Children of Men; <HI>Children,</HI> expect them not from your fondest <HI>Parents.</HI> They are Dy∣ing. Their <HI>Comforts</HI> will Dye with them. They return to their <HI>Earth;</HI> see the Vanity of such <HI>Earthly Com∣forts.</HI> When their <HI>Breath</HI> goes forth, in <HI>that very Day,</HI> the <HI>Comforts</HI> we had
<PB N="31" REF="001693_0017_0FB529839678EA18"/>in them, do all <HI>Perish.</HI> Retire then unto the <HI>Living God;</HI> Oh! <HI>Cry out</HI> for Him, to Him; and say, <HI>My God, Thou shalt be my Comforter!</HI></Q> This was the <HI>Comfort</HI> which a Child of God once refreshed himself withal; And, Oh! the reviving Refreshment of such a Cordial! Psal. XXVII.10. <HI>When my Father and my Mother forsake me, then the Lord shall take me up.</HI> In Imitation thereof, it will become us to say, <HI>Whatever Comforters forsake me, Lord, I am not Miserable, if thou art still my</HI> Comforter. <HI>Tho' all fails here Below, Lord, it is enough, that thou art the strength of my Heart, and my Portion for ever!</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. What remains, is this <HI>Admoni∣tion of the Lord</HI> unto us; Despise not, Refuse not, the <HI>Consolations</HI> which an Heavenly <HI>Father</HI> has ready for you; Become the <HI>Children</HI> of God, and put in for a share in His <HI>Consolations.</HI> 'Tis an Expostulation, which we are every one of us to be address'd withal; Job XV.11. <HI>Are the Consolations of God small with thee?</HI> My Hearers, The <HI>Con∣solations</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="001693_0018_0FB52985167F0498"/>of God are <HI>small</HI> with you, if you count them too <HI>small</HI> to be worth all your Pains, and all your Cares, &amp; an <HI>Head</HI> becoming a <HI>Fountain of Tears,</HI> distilled in your Prayers, from Fired and Flaming Hearts, to be made par∣takers of them. They are <HI>small</HI> with you, if you count them so <HI>small,</HI> that they will not sufficiently <HI>Sweeten,</HI> and more than <HI>Ballance</HI> the worst of your <HI>Calamities.</HI> They are <HI>small</HI> with you, if all the Riches, and all the Delights under Heaven, do not appear to you <HI>small</HI> Things in comparison of them. And if you cast Contempt on the <HI>Com∣forts</HI> of God, what can you look for, but horrible <HI>Torments?</HI> The very <HI>Re∣flection</HI> on the Folly of the Contempt, will sting the Soul with a Thousand horrible <HI>Torments?</HI> Or, if you will not have GOD for your <HI>Comforter,</HI> whom, or what will you find any where to <HI>Comfort</HI> you? Forsake the <HI>Mercies,</HI> and the <HI>Comforts</HI> which you may have to be <HI>your own,</HI> (a Merciful GOD, who profers to be <HI>your own God, and to Bless you!</HI>) and you will find your selves in the midst of none but
<PB N="33" REF="001693_0018_0FB52985167F0498"/><HI>lying Vanities.</HI> Why, why will you so <HI>Deceive</HI> your selves?</P>
<P>Wherefore, <HI>let my Counsil be accep∣table to you.</HI></P>
<P>First; Chuse the Glorious GOD, for your God, and <HI>Portion;</HI> He will then be your God, and <HI>Comforter.</HI> Come to that Action; Lam. III.24. <HI>The Lord is my Portion, saith my Soul; Therefore will I hope in Him.</HI> Soul, Do this, and thereon <HI>hope</HI> for <HI>Comfort</HI> from Him! We read Isa. XLIX.13 <HI>Sing, O Heavens, and Rejoice, O Earth; for the Lord has comforted His People.</HI> They are the <HI>People</HI> of God, who may ex∣pect <HI>Comfort</HI> from God. And who are the <HI>People</HI> of God? A <HI>People</HI> willing to place all their Happiness in the <HI>Know∣ledge,</HI> and <HI>Favour</HI> and <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Ser∣vice</HI> of GOD. A <HI>People</HI> willing to be under the <HI>Conduct</HI> of a JESUS, that they may be brought unto the <HI>Enjoy∣ment</HI> of God. A People willing to be form'd into Holy and Lovely <HI>Temples,</HI> by the <HI>good Spirit</HI> of God. This <HI>willing People,</HI> are they, to whom there belong more <HI>Comforts,</HI> than there are Stars in Heaven!</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="001693_0019_0FB52986983EE0F0"/>
Secondly. Who is He, that is, <HI>The Consolation of Israel?</HI> O Accept Him; Embrace Him; Close with Him; set the highest <HI>Price</HI> upon Him. Say to Him, <HI>Lord, I am Thine; save me.</HI> We read, 2 Cor. I.5. <HI>Our Consolation a∣boundeth by Christ.</HI> Believer, when a CHRIST is thine, thou hast <HI>Comfort</HI> enough. <HI>All Fulness,</HI> and so <HI>all Comfort</HI> is <HI>dwelling in Him.</HI> Go to Him, in all thy <HI>Exercises;</HI> Look to Him as the <HI>Purchaser,</HI> look to Him as the <HI>Dispenser</HI> of all <HI>Consolations;</HI> Wait on Him for <HI>Consolations</HI> that will suit all thy <HI>Exer∣cises.</HI> All <HI>Comfort</HI> built any where but upon Him, is built on the <HI>Sand;</HI> will fail the <HI>Foolish Builder.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. Don't <HI>Grieve</HI> the Grand <HI>Comforter.</HI> That is to say, what you have in Eph. IV.30. <HI>Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God.</HI> If He <HI>withdraw</HI> from you, all <HI>Comfort</HI> goes with Him <HI>Indulged Sin</HI> will cause His <HI>withdraw</HI> from you. Wretches that wallow in Sin, and pretend at the same Time unto <HI>Comfort;</HI> O deluded Wretches, what will be the woful Issue of your <HI>sportful Delusions?</HI> Verily, To lye <HI>down
<PB N="35" REF="001693_0019_0FB52986983EE0F0"/>in Sorrow!</HI> See that you <HI>Walk Circum∣spectly;</HI> See that you <HI>Walk before the Lord in the Land of the Living;</HI> See that you maintain a Prayerful, Watchful, Fruitful <HI>Walk,</HI> with a <HI>Conscience void of Offence towards God, and towards Man.</HI> The <HI>Comforter</HI> will then fill you with unknown <HI>Consolations.</HI> The Tendency of such a <HI>Walk</HI> is to <HI>Joy unspeakable and full of Glory.</HI> The <HI>Pathes</HI> of it are <HI>Pathes of Peace;</HI> and at the <HI>End</HI> of it the <HI>Perfect</HI> and <HI>Upright</HI> find an endless <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly. I will not break off, till I have told you of a <HI>Mother,</HI> who will <HI>Comfort</HI> you, yea, bring you the <HI>Con∣solations of God,</HI> if you will do your Duty to her. No doubt, you are a∣ware, who that <HI>Mother</HI> is, that I now point you to. 'Tis the <HI>Church of the Living God:</HI> The CHURCH, where∣to they generally apply that Passage; Cant. III.4. <HI>I brought Him into the House of my Mother, and into the Cham∣ber of her that conceived me.</HI> Yea, and the particular &amp; instituted CHURCH, of the Neighbourhood whereto you belong, shall have her Demand now
<PB N="36" REF="001693_0020_0FB52988168F5C30"/>made upon you; and require the Duty owing to a <HI>Mother</HI> from you. I show you this Day, A <HI>Faithful Peo∣ple</HI> Associated and Incorporated for the Worship of God our Saviour, and I use the Language of our Dying JESUS to His Disciple, <HI>Behold, Thy Mother!</HI> My Neighbour, <HI>Behold, Thy Mother!</HI> You owe no little Duty to such a <HI>Mother in Israel!</HI> Children, Come under the Wings of your <HI>Mo∣ther,</HI> by joining your selves unto the CHURCH that is ready to receive you. She will then admit you to the <HI>Comforts</HI> of those <HI>Ordinances,</HI> that are in her Dispensation; She will <HI>Comfort</HI> you with the <HI>Fruits</HI> wherewith Her Beloved has furnished Her for you. She will <HI>Comfort</HI> you with a <HI>Feast of Fat Things full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees well refined.</HI> There are <HI>Crowns</HI> with which your <HI>Mother</HI> will <HI>Crown</HI> you, in the Day when She <HI>Espouses</HI> you to your Saviour; and brings you to a <HI>Gladness of Heart</HI> that shall never, never be extinguished. If you have no Value for these <HI>Comforts,</HI> Heaven will esteem you no better than the <HI>Children of Edom.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="001693_0020_0FB52988168F5C30"/>
What I press for, is, That so many of you would no more turn your Backs on the <HI>Table</HI> of your <HI>Mother,</HI> but Conscienciously Prepare for, and Approach to, the <HI>Supper</HI> of your Sa∣viour there; The <HI>Childrens Bread.</HI> Some of those, who omit this Duty, are on all other Accounts as well dis∣posed People as any in the World; yet in this, I declare unto you, I <HI>Praise you not.</HI> It is impossible for them to make any <HI>Apology</HI> for this Omission, but what will imply a real <HI>Miscar∣riage</HI> in them. Their best Apology is, That they have lest the state of their Souls, at such <HI>Uncertainties,</HI> that they dare not come to the more <HI>special and awful Ordinances.</HI> But, Syrs, Is this Excusable? Suffer me to go on with my Expostulation. If every one should be disposed as you are, what would become of your <HI>Mother?</HI> This Omis∣sion of yours, will Distress you on a <HI>Death-bed,</HI> I am certain of it, I am certain of it! How soon you may come to lye on a <HI>Death-bed,</HI> neither you nor I do know. Would you do what <HI>common Sense</HI> requires to be done,
<PB N="38" REF="001693_0021_0FB5298A5D24A9B0"/>by Men in <HI>Daily</HI> Expectation of their <HI>Dying Day,</HI> you would be no longer <HI>unprepared</HI> for that commanded Action of, <HI>shewing forth the Death of the Lord.</HI> But this I know; That your having left this Duty undone, will be a <HI>Bit∣terness</HI> unto you in a <HI>dying Hour.</HI> You will then blame your selves for it, and Mourn exceedingly, and say with a Regret which <HI>who can bear?</HI>—<HI>Oh! That I had made more thorough Work, in that Article of Obedience unto God; my coming to Him in all His Ordinances!</HI>— I wish, that I may not see this Pre∣diction too quickly accomplished on some of my dear Friends, to whom I wish as well as to my own Soul; Friends, whom 'tis because I Love them exceedingly, that I now deal so Faithfully withal, and from this <HI>public Place of Thunder,</HI> do Repeat the Warnings of God unto them. The Voice of a good Man, is that, 1 Chron. XXIX.3. <HI>I have set my Affection on the House of my God.</HI> Syrs, 'Tis your <HI>Mo∣ther,</HI> for whom I bespeak this <HI>good Affection!</HI> But then, if this <HI>Church</HI> of the Lord, is to have the Regards of a
<PB N="39" REF="001693_0021_0FB5298A5D24A9B0"/><HI>Mother</HI> from you, Beware, beware, that none of you do the Part of a <HI>spurious Brood</HI> in ill Treating of her. Wish well to her, Deal well by her, Do her no Wrong in the World. <Q><HI>Ye shall fear every Man his Mother, I am the Lord your God,</HI> who command it, saith the Lord, and will Punish you, if you Wrong such a <HI>Mother.</HI></Q> No, You must Love your <HI>Mother</HI> dear∣ly; If you have the <HI>Love of the Father</HI> in you, it will make you do so! You must heartily Desire, mightily Study, zealously Project, that she may Flou∣rish before the Lord, and be well ac∣commodated in all her Interests. What you do for such a <HI>Mother,</HI> your Glorious Lord will say, <HI>You have done it unto me!</HI> And He will Reward it Gloriously.</P>
<P>You are sensible, That what has obliged me, to Entertain you with these Meditations, is, The Death of a Pious, Loving, Tender MOTHER, with whose <HI>Comforts,</HI> I have been for more than one and fifty Years fa∣voured of God. Tho' she command∣ed
<PB N="40" REF="001693_0022_0FB5298BD8466E88"/>me, <HI>To speak little or nothing of her,</HI> and I have obeyed her Command, yet, I hope, you will think, that some Things in my Sermon have not been <HI>Impertinently,</HI> or <HI>Unreasonably</HI> spoken. When I drew the Picture of a <HI>good Mother</HI> above half an Hour ago, you may be sure, I had somebody <HI>sit∣ting</HI> before me for it; You may be sure, I could not say, <HI>I had never seen such an one!</HI> And there shall yet re∣main a Truth in that Prophecy of the <HI>Vertuous Woman;</HI> Prov. XXXI.28. <HI>Her Children arise up, &amp; call her Blessed.</HI> But I am sure, I am not forbidden to tell you, That no <HI>Mother,</HI> no <HI>Creature,</HI> can <HI>Solace</HI> us with such <HI>Consolations</HI> as in our Glorious God, we have left unto us.</P>
<P>And Oh! How much is this <HI>one Thing</HI> to be <HI>desired?</HI>—That whereas <HI>one Generation passeth away, and another cometh on,</HI> that which <HI>cometh on,</HI> may not be on the saddest Accounts <HI>ano∣ther Generation,</HI> but that what there was of <HI>Heaven</HI> in those Handmaids of the Lord may <HI>Abide for ever</HI> among us. There has been a Set of Aged
<PB N="41" REF="001693_0022_0FB5298BD8466E88"/>and Pious Women taken from us, whereof we cannot but be desirous, that they who survive and succeed may <HI>Do like</HI> unto them. We read of some, Jud. II.17. <HI>They turned quickly out of the way which their Fathers walk∣ed in; Those obey'd the Commandments of the Lord; but these did NOT SO.</HI> But, O Children, let there not be cause to say, <HI>You turn quickly out of the way which your Mothers walked in; These walked with God; but you do NOT SO.</HI> I must say to you, That in multitudes of Instances, to have that Proverb actually made Good, <HI>As is the Mother, so is the Daughter,</HI> would be the way for us to have, <HI>Glory dwelling in our Land.</HI> It may be said of our departed <HI>Mothers,</HI> That they did <HI>Abound in Sup∣plications Night and Day;</HI> and often set apart <HI>whole Days</HI> for <HI>Prayer with Fasting</HI> in secret Places before the

<PB N="42" REF="001693_0023_0FB5298D58511CE8"/>Lord.
<NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>† She Writes thus:
<Q>While I was a Child, I loved the Ways of God; I took great De∣light in secret Communion with God in Prayer. From the Exemple of <HI>Daniel,</HI> I did not live one Day without Prayer to God <HI>Three times a Day.</HI> But as I grew Older, Temptations and Afflictions came upon me, that I found, there was no living qui∣etly, without more Acquaintance with my Redeemer. I then pray'd <HI>Six times a Day.</HI></Q></P>
<P>She Writes thus:, <Q>I kept a <HI>Fast</HI> lately, and found such Communion with God, and Answer of Prayer, that I long'd for such another Opportunity. Therefore I came a∣gain into the Presence of God for Grace and Mercy. They that will <HI>Fast</HI> with God, shall <HI>Feast</HI> with Him too!</Q></P></NOTE> God forbid, that it should be your Character, to lead <HI>Prayerless Lives,</HI> and rarely go alone to <HI>Pour out your Souls</HI> unto the Lord, and <HI>cast your Burdens</HI> on Him. It may be said of your departed <HI>Mothers,</HI> That they were Sollicitous above all Things, to <HI>make their Calling and Election sure,</HI> and get their <HI>Evidences for Heaven</HI> clear∣ed up.
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">She Writes thus:
<Q>I was afraid after all I must Perish: But God caused me to <HI>give no Rest to my Eyes, nor Slumber to my Eye∣lids,</HI> till I had great Assurance of His Love, and of Eternal Happiness when this frail Life should be ended.</Q></NOTE> God forbid, That it should
<PB N="43" REF="001693_0023_0FB5298D58511CE8"/>be your Character, To go on from Year to Year in a <HI>Neglect of the great Salvation,</HI> and unconcerned whether you are so <HI>Justified by Faith,</HI> as to be <HI>at Peace with God.</HI> It may be said of your departed <HI>Mothers,</HI> That they had a distressing Sollicitude upon their Minds for the <HI>Conversion of their Chil∣dren</HI> unto God, &amp; their Preservation in the <HI>Right ways of the Lord.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>She Writes thus:
<Q>I kept a Day of Fast∣ing and Prayer, That God would bestow special Grace upon all the Family; and that He would keep all our poor Children, that not one of them should be Guilty of any <HI>Scandalous Sins,</HI> nor live in any <HI>Secret Sins.</HI> Oh! Lord, Let not one of my Chil∣dren Perish; no, <HI>Not one, Not one</HI> of them! Lord, Let not me be Guilty of the Blood of any one of their <HI>Souls.</HI> I know, I take much, and it is well if not too much Care of their <HI>Bodies;</HI> But, Lord, I pray, that I may take much more Care of their Never∣dying Souls. Oh! That I may Discharge a good Conscience on that Account!</Q></P>
<P>Of her Children, she Writes thus further; <Q>I was often afraid in having many Chil∣dren, lest I should have one more than Jesus Christ would accept of: But now I desire to believe for them all.</Q></P></NOTE> God forbid, That it should be your Cha∣racter, To leave your <HI>Children Uncul∣tivated</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="001693_0024_0FB5298ED6B24998"/>with the best Endowments, and be able to bear their <HI>going on still in their Trespasses.</HI> In a Word; Your <HI>Mothers</HI> are your <HI>Monitors,</HI> and will not be your <HI>Gomforters,</HI> No, but your grievous <HI>Accusers,</HI> if you do not walk <HI>after the manner of the Old Time,</HI> and as the <HI>Holy Women,</HI> who <HI>trusted in God,</HI> and <HI>adorned themselves with such Things as are of great Price in the Sight of God.</HI></P>
