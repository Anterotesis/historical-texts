<P>Upon reading the aforesaid Articles, <HI>John Baptist Jedre,</HI> alias <HI>Laver∣dure,</HI> desired that the same might be interpreted to him and his Son <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior in the <HI>French</HI> Language, for that he the said <HI>John Baptist</HI> (the Father) did not understand <HI>English</HI> very well; and his Son was wholly Ignorant of the <HI>English</HI> Language.</P>
<P>Whereupon Messieurs <HI>Peter Lucy</HI> and <HI>Peter Frazier,</HI> both of <HI>Boston,</HI> Merchants, were Sworn Interpreters between the Court and the Priso∣ners; and then Interpreted the said Articles to the Prisoners, Article by Article; to which they severally pleaded not Guilty.</P>

<P>PRESENT, The Honourable WILLIAM DUMMER <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Lieut. Governour and Commander in Chief of the said Province, President; and all the other Commissioners before-named.</P>
<P>Then the Prisoners were brought to the Bar, and their Advocate hav∣ing been served with a Copy of the Articles exhibited against them, and prepared for their Trial, the said Articles were read again.</P>
<P>After reading thereof, His Majesty's Advocate made a Speech to the Court as followed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>MAY it please Your Honour Mr. <HI>President,</HI> and the Honourable the Com∣missioners, <HI>John Baptist</HI> Senior, and <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior, the Prisoners at the Bar, stand Articled against for Acts of <HI>Piracy, Robbery</HI> and <HI>Felony,</HI> Com∣mitted upon the High Seas, within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> contrary to the Peace of our Sovereign Lord the King, His Crown and Dignity, and the Statutes in such Cases Made and Provided: To which upon Arraignment, they have severally pleaded <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>The Word <HI>Pirate,</HI> with inconsiderable Variation, is taken from the <HI>Greek</HI> Substantive <HI>Peirates, Praedo Marinus,</HI> and therefore a Pirate in a Legal Sense is called a <HI>Robber on the High Seas</HI>: And under this Consideration I'm humbly of Opinion, the Prisoners at the Bar will evidently appear to your Honours, in the Series of this their Trial: Persons whom the Law with the greatest Pro∣priety justly Terms <HI>Pirates.</HI> And however others may pride themselves in accurately handling abstruse and knotty Cases; I esteem it my Felicity, that the Articles now exhibited to your Honours, are grounded upon plain and clear Matters of Fact; Facts which proceed from the Rancour and Virulency of their evil Hearts, from a craving Appetite, and an insatiable Thirst after inordinate Gain. And finally, Facts if not now timely Corrected by Your Honours experienced Justice, will most certainly terminate in the breaking up of our Fishery, the most valuable Branch of our <HI>New-England</HI> Trade. But for as much as I'm sensible Glosses with your Honours pass not for Arguments, or Varnish for Evidence; So I'm well assured, when positive and direct Proofs appear before You in their full Proportion, they will have their Usual and Legal Weight in Your Honours Determination: And therefore upon the Evidences I shall produce on the part of the King, I may reasonably expect in Justice to His Majesty, in Compliance with the Laws of our Land, and in
<PB N="8" REF="002818_0007_0FE64FF798EF0E80"/>
a due and tender Regard to this His Majesty's Province, and the Safety and Preservation of the Lives and Properties of His Majesty's most Loyal and Du∣tiful Subjects in this Government, Your Honour and the Honourable the Commissioners will adjudge the Prisoners at the Bar respectively Guilty of all and every the Articles exhibited against them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Cryer of said Court was directed by Mr. Advocate to call the King's Evidences.</P>
<P>Afterwards the Witnesses for our Sovereign Lord the King, Namely, Captain <HI>Samuel Doty, Nathaniel Sprague, John Roberts, Silas Cooke,</HI> and <HI>Philip Sachimus,</HI> were Called and Sworn, and severally Deposed as fol∣loweth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>SAmuel Doty</HI> of <HI>Plymouth</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> Mariner, and Master of the Sloop <HI>Tryal,</HI> Deposeth and Saith, That on <HI>Wednesday</HI> the 25th Day of <HI>August</HI> last past, (with the consent of his Men) he put into <HI>Malegash</HI> Harbour, to Water, &amp; from thence designed to Prosecute their Fishing-Voyage near the Isle of <HI>Sables</HI>; And seeing <HI>John Baptist,</HI> the Father, on Shoar, the Deponent haled him, and asked him to come on board. And soon after the Prisoners at the Bar, came on board the Sloop in a Canno, when the Deponent ask'd what News? The said <HI>John Baptist Jedre,</HI> alias <HI>Laverdure,</HI> answered there was Peace between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> and particularly at <HI>Boston, Annapolis,</HI> and <HI>Causo</HI>; And there∣upon the said <HI>Baptist</HI> and the Deponent went into the Cabbin, and left the said <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior upon Deck; After the Deponent, and <HI>John Baptist</HI> had drank together, the Deponent went upon Deck with intent to go ashoar in the Canno, but <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Son was gone ashoar in it, then the Deponent with the Mate and three more Men, took the Sloops Canno, and went ashoar, leaving the said <HI>Baptist</HI> on board, with <HI>Philip Sachimus,</HI> the said <HI>Baptist</HI> declining to go a Shore with them when ask'd, saying he would Call his Son, and he should carry him on Shore. That some short time after the Deponent and his Men had left the Sloop, the said <HI>Baptist</HI> called to his Son on Shoar, and spake to him in a Lan∣guage unknown to the Deponent, and presently <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior, with two <HI>Indians,</HI> namely, <HI>James Mews</HI> and <HI>Philip Mews,</HI> went into the said <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Can∣no, and after they had got about a Gun shot from the Shore, one of the <HI>Indians</HI> held up his Gun and Fired it, &amp; called to the Deponent and Company as they stood on the Shoar, saying, You <HI>English</HI> Men, ask for Quarter; and after the <HI>Indians</HI> had got on board the Sloop, they took down the <HI>English Ensign</HI> then fly∣ing, which the Deponent perceiving, he then went to the House of Mrs. <HI>Giddery,</HI> Mother to the said <HI>John Baptist,</HI> and desired her, with her Son <HI>Augustine</HI> to go on board the Sloop with him, and intercede with the said <HI>Baptist</HI> that the Depo∣nent might have his Sloop again. And after some Considerable Time, Mrs. <HI>Giddery</HI> and her Son went on board with the Deponent, when he the Deponent saw the Ensign girded round <HI>Baptist</HI>'s middle, and a Pistol tuckt in it, which
<PB N="9" REF="002818_0008_0FE64FFBD4BD1CD0"/>
belonged to one of the Deponents Men, namely <HI>John Roberts.</HI> At which time there were several more <HI>Indians</HI> on board the Sloop, who pusht the Deponent about the Vessel, and Evilly treated him; and one of them Attempted to strike him with his Hatchet, but was prevented by another <HI>Indian.</HI> The Deponent further saith, That towards the Evening, the said <HI>John Baptist Jedre</HI> ordered him to come to Sail, and to Steer the Sloop Eastward; And the next day early in the Morning, they discovered a Vessel, which they tho't was an <HI>English</HI> Vessel, when the said <HI>John Baptist</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> gave out, that they would go and Kill all the <HI>English</HI> Men on board, and then the Deponent should have his Sloop again; but she proved to be a <HI>French</HI> Scooner belonging to Cape <HI>Breton,</HI> which had been at <HI>Malegash</HI> the day before the Deponents Sloop arrived there. That when the Scooner appeared in sight, the Prisoners with the <HI>Indians,</HI> divi∣ded the Powder and Shot which belonged to the Sloop, put new Flints into their Guns, cut up the Fishing Leads to make Sluggs for their small Arms, and load∣ed them with design (as they said) to take the said Scooner, if she had been an <HI>English</HI> Vessel.</P>
<P>And further the Deponent saith, That afterwards he Steered the Sloop for <HI>Mahoon Bay,</HI> to the <HI>Eastward</HI> of <HI>Ashpetauget,</HI> by Order of the said <HI>Baptist,</HI> who sometimes Steered himself; And when she was about seven Leagues Eastward of <HI>Malegash,</HI> the Deponent and his Company having agreed to rise upon the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> took their Opportunity to do it, soon after they had been at Breakfast, on the 26th. of <HI>August,</HI> when <HI>Baptist</HI> and three <HI>Indian</HI> Men with an <HI>Indian</HI> Woman and two Children were in the Cabbin; And the Deponent shut the Cabbin-Door upon them; but <HI>Baptist</HI> hearing the <HI>English</HI> scuffling with the <HI>Indians</HI> upon Deck, soon came out of the Cabbin, having burst open the Cabbin-Door, and the Mate struck him down with a Club, and <HI>Phillip Sachimus</HI> threw him overboard; Soon after the <HI>English</HI> fired into the Cabbin, and the three <HI>Indi∣an</HI> Men got out of the Cabbin-Windows into the Sea, in order to Swim on Shoar; and Young <HI>Baptist</HI> and the other <HI>Indians</HI> were thrown into the Hold; And after the Prisoners and <HI>Indians</HI> were subdued, <HI>Baptist</HI> was taken on board the Sloop again from out of a Canno, which lay astern.</P>
<P><HI>NAthaniel Sprague,</HI> Mate of the Sloop <HI>Tryal</HI> saith, That on the 25th. of <HI>August</HI> last, he went on Shoar at <HI>Malegash</HI> with Mr. <HI>Doty</HI> and others, and left <HI>John Baptist</HI> and <HI>Phillip Sachimus</HI> on board the Sloop. That soon after the Deponent got on Shoar, <HI>Baptist</HI> called to his Son to come on board, as the Deponent be∣lieves, (tho' he spake in Language to him unknown) and thereupon the said <HI>Bap∣tist</HI>'s Son, with two <HI>Indians</HI> Armed, put off from the Land in a Canno, and when the Canno was some distance from the Shoar, one of them fired a Gun, and said to the <HI>English</HI> on Shoar, you <HI>English</HI> Men call for Quarter, and then the said <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior, and the two <HI>Indians,</HI> viz. <HI>James</HI> &amp; <HI>Philip Mews,</HI> went on board the said Sloop. And the Deponent, as he stood on Shoar, saw some of them with <HI>Baptist</HI> take the Sloop's Ensign down, and then they fired se∣veral small Arms into the Air.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="002818_0009_0FE64FFC06A3D058"/>The Deponent further saith. That he tarried on Shoar till Mr. <HI>Doty</HI> called to him from the Sloop▪ and told him he believed the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> would give him good Quarter if he came on board; So the Deponent and <HI>Silas Cooke</HI> ven∣tured to go on board, and as they came along side the Sloop, several of the Peo∣ple on board presented their Guns at them; Some of them had their Hatchets, and others their Knives, and they haul'd him along the Vessel, and Barbarously treated him; And two <HI>Indians</HI> afterwards held the Mazzles of their Guns at him with intent, as he thought) to Shoot him, so to escape the danger, he jumpt into the Hold. Soon after the said <HI>Baptist</HI> called to him, and bid him come out of the Hold, or else he would be killed; So the Deponent came upon Deck, and the said <HI>Baptist</HI> and others bound him with Lines. That <HI>Baptist</HI> called himself Skipper of the Sloop, and <HI>James Mews</HI> an <HI>Indian,</HI> called himself the Captain of her. The Deponent farther saith, that the next day, <HI>viz.</HI> the 26th. of <HI>August,</HI> looking out of the Hold, he saw the said <HI>Baptist</HI> with his Pistol tuckt through the Sloops Ensign, which was round his Waste, and heard him order Mr. <HI>Doty</HI> to take the Helm. That young <HI>Baptist</HI> walked the Deck with his Gun. That the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> eat the Sloops Bread, Butter, Pork, and Sugar, and Drank the Rum and other Liquors which belonged to the <HI>English.</HI> That after Breakfast, one of the <HI>English Men</HI> called to the Deponent in the Hold, and told him that there was a good Opportunity to rise upon the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> there being but three or four of them upon Deck; Whereupon the Deponent came upon the Deck and saw Mr. <HI>Doty</HI> put to the Cabbin-Door, and then he took hold of one of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who was too strong for the said <HI>Doty,</HI> and threw him down. By this time <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior, who before was lying down on his Gun, got up with it, but the Deponent struck him down, and <HI>Baptist</HI> (the Father) hearing the Noise, burst open the half Door of the Cabbin, and came out with the Sloops Ensign round his middle, and a Pistol tuckt in it, and got hold of the Deponent, but he flung the said <HI>Baptist</HI> a-cross the Gunnel, and <HI>Philip Sachimus,</HI> (who stood to keep the Cabbin-Door fast) took the said <HI>Baptist</HI> and threw him over-board: About this time <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior cryed for Quarter, yet after∣wards got a Fisherman's Pew, and struck at the Deponent with all his might, but mist his Blow, and only tore the Deponents Shirt; Who then knockt the said <HI>Baptist</HI> down, and he was thrown into the Sloops Hold, together with <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>James Mews,</HI> and the Hatches were shut down upon them; And three <HI>Indians</HI> who were in the Cabbin, got out of the Cabbin-Windows in order to Swim on Shoar.</P>
<P>That after the Prisoners were subdued, the Deponent saw <HI>Baptist</HI> the Father, with two Rings and a pair of Stockings taken from <HI>John Roberts</HI>; And <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior had on Mr. <HI>Doty</HI>'s Cap.</P>
<P><HI>JOhn Roberts</HI> deposeth and saith, That he heard <HI>John Baptist</HI> when he first came on board the Sloop say, there was Peace. That the Deponent went ashoar with Mr. <HI>Doty</HI> and his Mate, and soon after saw <HI>Philip Mews</HI> strike the Colours,
<PB N="11" REF="002818_0010_0FE6500618A53C10"/>
that the Deponent tarried on Shoar till the Evening when the Sloop came to Sail.</P>
<P>That when he came on board, the Sloops Colours were round <HI>Baptist</HI>'s mid∣dle, with the Deponents Pistol tuckt thro' the same, and he saw a Gold Ring belonging to him the Deponent upon the said <HI>Baptist</HI>s Finger. That young <HI>Baptist</HI> stood over the Scattle with a Musket in his Hand. That he loaded a Pistol, and his Father then took it from him. That <HI>Baptist</HI> called the Deponent Son of a Bitch, hauled him out of his Hammock upon the Floor, and bid him come up and Steer. The next Morning early they discovered a Scooner, when <HI>Baptist</HI> consulted with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and supposing she was an <HI>English</HI> Vessel, they put new Flints in their Guns, and loaded them, and told the Deponent, that if they took the Scooner, they would Kill the <HI>English</HI> and keep the Scooner, and then the said <HI>Doty</HI> and Company should have their Sloop again But the Vessel proved to be a <HI>French</HI> Scooner, which as the said <HI>Baptist</HI> said, had been lately at <HI>Malegash; Baptist</HI> then Ordered the Deponent to Steer for <HI>Mahoon Bay</HI>: But soon after the Deponent assisted the said <HI>Doty</HI> and Company in subduing the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> as before is Deposed by him the said <HI>Doty</HI> and his Mate.</P>
<P><HI>SIlas Cooke</HI> Deposeth and saith, That he saw <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior with a Gun, which was taken from him, and afterwards one of the <HI>English</HI> Men fired it into the Cabbin, whereupon three <HI>Indian</HI> Men got out of the Cabbin Window into the Sea. The Deponent further saith, That he saw the Sloop's Colours round <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Waste, with a Pistol tuckt into it, and several times he had ano∣ther Gun in his Hands. That he Ordered the Deponent to Steer for <HI>Mahoon-Bay.</HI> That the said <HI>Baptist</HI> took the Vessel's Biscake, Butter and Cheese, and made use of the Sugar, Tobacco and Pipes, and divided the Powder, and Young <HI>Baptist</HI> made Sluggs for the Small Arms, with the Leads of the Fishing Lines belonging to the Sloop.</P>
<P><HI>PHilip Sachimus</HI> being Called Deposeth and saith, That he heard <HI>John Baptist</HI> when he first came on board the Sloop, say there was a very good Peace. And afterwards Capt. <HI>Doty</HI> &amp; his Men went ashoar, and left him the Deponent and <HI>Baptist</HI> on board. That Mr. <HI>Doty</HI> ask'd him to go a Shoar, but the said <HI>Bap∣tist</HI> answered he would Cast his Son. After the <HI>English</HI> Men got a Shoar <HI>Baptist</HI> Called to his Son <HI>John Baptist,</HI> who together with <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Phillip Mews,</HI> two <HI>Indians,</HI> came aboard in a Canno. That <HI>Phillip Mews</HI> and <HI>Baptist</HI> (the Father) talk'd together, and <HI>James Mews</HI> took out his Knife and run after the Deponent and struck at him. That young <HI>Baptist</HI> pointed a Gun at him, but he can't tell whether he snapt it or no. That the two <HI>Indian</HI> afterwards tied the Deponent under the Windless, so he could not see who struck the Colours, but afterwards he saw them round <HI>Baptist</HI>'s middle. That he saw them take the <HI>English</HI> Mens Guns. This Deponent saw <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior had a Pistol and make Sluggs with the Fishing Leads; he also saw <HI>John Roberts</HI> his Rings upon <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Finger, and the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> had the Command of the Sloop the Capt. <HI>Do<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> and his Company overcame them the next day.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please Your Honour, Mr. <HI>President,</HI> and the rest of the Honourable Commissi∣oners of this Court:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not without Regret that I appear before this Honourable Court in behalf of the Prisoners at the Bar: But the Sense of my Duty, and my real Desire that the World, and more especially their Country men, should be convinced of the fair and impartial Trial they will receive, weigh down all Objections to my appearing for them. And although they may labour under some Inconveniences on Account of their not understanding the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, yet I take that to be sufficiently made up to them, by the great Candour and Impartiality your Honours have shown in granting them Interpreters and other∣wise.</P>
<P>As it is my Province to speak only to Matters of Law, I shall endeavour to perform it as well as the very little time I have had will allow; and waving any Observations upon the Evidences that have been Sworn, humbly beg your Honours Consideration of two Matters, which I conceive worthy thereof. The first of which relates equally to both the Prisoners, the last to <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior only.</P>
<P>I am well perswaded there hath been a great peice of Villany lately acted in the Harbour of <HI>Malagash,</HI> by the seizing and taking of Capt. <HI>Doty</HI> and his Men and Vessel, in which the Prisoners may have borne their part, but your Honour, and the rest of the Honourable Court, will well distinguish Crimes of different Na∣tures, and not Condemn Persons for Piracy because they may be Guilty of No∣torious Robberies or other Crimes, and I submit it to your Honours whether the Prisoners can be adjudged Guilty of Piracy. My Lord Chief Justice <HI>Hale</HI> in his <HI>Plac. Coron.</HI> treating of Piracy says, <Q>It extends not to Offences in Creeks or Ports within the Body of a County, because punishable by the Common Law.</Q> Pag. 77. <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Edition. And says another Book, <Q>If a Pirate en∣ter a Port or Haven, and Assaults and Robs a Merchant-Ship at Anchor there, this is no Piracy, because it is not done <HI>Super Altum Mare,</HI> but it is a downright Robbery at the Common Law, the Act being <HI>infra Corpus Comita∣tus,</HI> Jacob<HI>'s Lex Mercat.</HI> Pag. 183.</Q> <HI>Medio,</HI> both which agree with the Defini∣tion of <HI>Piracy</HI> given by my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> in his Comments upon <HI>Littleton,</HI> Pag. 291. a. If then it appears to your Honours, (as I think it must by the Evidence) that the Facts charged upon the Prisoners were Committed in an Harbour within the Body of a County: And supposing they were the real Actors there∣of, they are not guilty of Piracy, but ought to be tried at the Common Law, as Robbers, by a Jury, and your Honours will acquit them of the Articles now exhibited against them by the Advocate General on His Majesty's behalf.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002818_0012_0FE6500832C7C950"/>But, May it please your Honours, The Case of the young Lad at the Bar, <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior, is distinguished from that of his Father, on account of his tender Years; being (as his Father informs me) not fourteen Years of Age; an Age which renders a Person incapable in the Law, of committing any Crime so as to be punished with Death, he being set upon the same Foot with a Mad-man by my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> upon <HI>Litt</HI> Pag. 247. b. who says, <Q>That in Criminal Causes, as Felony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Act and Wrong of a Mad-man shall not be imputed to him, for that in those Causes, <HI>Actus non facit reum, nisi Mens fit rea</HI>: And he is <HI>Amens</HI> (id est) <HI>sine mente,</HI> without his Mind and Discretion, and <HI>Furiosus solo furore punitur,</HI> A Mad man is only punished by his Madness. And so it is of an Infant, until he be of the Age of Fourteen, which in Law is accounted the Age of Discretion.</Q></P>
<P>It cannot be expected I should produce any Evidence of the Age of this Lad, who was born and educated in the Woods among the Wild and Salvage <HI>Indians,</HI> where no Register of Births or Burials is kept; he knows not his own Age, but by the Information of his Father, who here declares in publick Court, his Son is but Fourteen this Fall; there is no Evidence to disprove him in this Assertion, and where the Scale is but even, Your Honours will give the Bal∣lance in favour of Life.</P>
<P>Your Honours will likewise be pleased to consider the great Influences a Father hath upon his Son, not only in his Example but Precepts, as corrupt Nature is prone enough to evil; the Perswasions of a Father, or the fear of his Frowns and severe Corrections, back'd with his Example, are strong and pow∣erful Instigators to do Evil.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I submit the Case of the Prisoners to Your Honours wise Consideration, not in the least doubting of your just and impartial Judgment.</P>

<P>Then the said <HI>John Baptist</HI> in his own Defence alledged, That the People belonging to the aforesaid <HI>French</HI> Scooner (who he said had been at <HI>Malegash</HI> lately to buy Cattle to carry to Cape <HI>Breton)</HI> prevailed with him to do what he had done; telling him, that it would be the best way in order to get his Son <HI>Paul</HI> from the <HI>English,</HI> to take and keep one of their Vessels till they got him out of their Hands.— And further he added, That he had no de∣sign to kill any of the <HI>English,</HI> but hindred the <HI>Indians</HI> from hurting them with their Knives.</P>
<P><HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior pleaded for his Excuse, That what he did was by his Father's Order, and that the <HI>Indians</HI> advised him to assist in taking the said Vessel.</P>
<P>Afterwards <HI>John Baptist</HI> (the Father's) Examination, taken before <HI>Samuel Checkley</HI> and <HI>Habijah Savage</HI> Esqrs. two of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace, was Read, and is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Examination of <HI>John Baptist Jedre,</HI> alias <HI>Laverdure.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Examinant saith, That he lived at <HI>Malegash,</HI> and that on <HI>Wednesday</HI> the 25th Day of <HI>August</HI> last past, a Sloop with <HI>English</HI> Colours flying, came into the Harbour of <HI>Malegash,</HI> one <HI>Doty</HI> Master, and the Examinant and his Son went on board in a Canno; and his Son presently went on Shoar in the Canno. Soon after Mr. <HI>Doty</HI> and all his Men (except one) went on Shoar in the Sloop's Canno, to drink some <HI>Punch</HI> (as they said) at the Examinant's Mother's House, and he was asked by Captain <HI>Doty</HI> to go on Shoar with him, but he saw so many in the Canno, he told the said <HI>Doty</HI> he would call his Son to fetch him ashoar in his the said <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Canno, which he went ashoar in: So the Examinant, with an <HI>Indian</HI> Man called <HI>Philip,</HI> were left on board the Sloop.— After some time the Examinant called to his Son, who with two <HI>Indians</HI> came on board the Sloop in a Canno; and after them two <HI>Indians</HI> more, namely one <HI>Jerman</HI> and his Son <HI>Lewis,</HI> came on board in another Can∣no.— The Examinant saith, That his Brother-in-Law <HI>Philip Mews,</HI> one of the <HI>Indians,</HI> struck the Sloop's Colours, and gave 'em to him, and he tyed 'em round his middle.— That he told the <HI>English</HI> there was Peace with the <HI>In∣dians</HI>; Afterwards another Canno came on board with two <HI>Indian</HI> Men, a Squaw and two Children. And further the Examinant saith, That the <HI>Indian Philip,</HI> who was left on board, was tyed soon after the <HI>Indians</HI> came on board, least he should do them some Mischief, but afterwards they sent him ashoar to tell the Master to come on board. He saith that he saw the Cabbin-Door open, but can't tell whether it was broke open or no.— That his Son had <HI>John Ro∣berts</HI>'s Pistol but fell a sleep with it, and so the Examinant took it, and fastened it thro' his Girdle, that he never fired it, his Hands being weak he had not strength to fire; The Examinant saith his Mother came on board the Sloop, but did not ask the <HI>Indians</HI> on board, the Reason why they took the Sloop from the <HI>English</HI> in time of Peace, because she understood some time before, they designed to take what <HI>English</HI> Vessels they could, notwithstanding the Peace, by way of Reprizals, by Reason the Examinant's Son <HI>Paul,</HI> and his Brother-in-Law <HI>Francis Mews</HI> were detained by the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>The Examinant further saith, That the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Louisbourg</HI> told the <HI>Indians</HI> the Peace which was made with the <HI>English</HI> would not continue long.— The Examinant also saith, That the <HI>Indians</HI> intended to carry the Sloop to his Plantation; and accordingly <HI>James Mews</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> Captain, ordered the Skipper <HI>Doty</HI> to weigh Anchor towards the Evening, and set sail for <HI>Mohune Bay.</HI>— That that Night they dressed some Victuals, that the next Morn∣ing early they saw a Scooner, which they supposed at first to be an <HI>English</HI> Vessel, but when they came near they discovered she was a <HI>French</HI> Scooner which
<PB N="15" REF="002818_0014_0FE6500EC13806E8"/>
they had traded with some Days before at <HI>Malegash.</HI>— That when they first espied her, they Cut up the <HI>English</HI> Fishing Leads, and beat them into Sluggs, divided among them the <HI>English</HI> Men's small Arms, and loaded them with the Sluggs, and the <HI>Indians</HI> took the <HI>English</HI> Mens Cloaths &amp; other things, and parti∣cularly the Examinant took from the <HI>Indians</HI> two Gold Rings and a pair of Sil∣ver Buckles, which they said they found in the Cabbin in a Handkerchief.— And after Breakfast on the 26th. day of <HI>August</HI> in the Morning, the <HI>English</HI> took their Opportunity to rise upon the <HI>Indians,</HI> when there was but a few of them upon Deck, and the Examinant with three <HI>Indian</HI> Men, an <HI>Indian</HI> Woman and her two Children were then in the Cabbin, when the Skipper <HI>Doty</HI> came from the Helm, and shut the Cabbin Door, but the Examinant opened it, and was no sooner come upon Deck but the Mate knockt him down and threw him over-board, but he took hold of the Sloops Canno which lay astern, and the <HI>English</HI> took him on board again. The Examinant says, That one of the <HI>Indi∣ans,</HI> who jumpt out of the Cabbin Window into the Sea, had on the Master's Jacket; And when the Examinant came on board again, the <HI>Indian</HI> Woman in∣formed him that her Husband and two more <HI>Indian</HI> Men being in the Cabbin, the <HI>English</HI> fired two Guns into the Cabbin, and they three got out of the Cab∣bin Windows, but the Examinant believes they were Drowned, the Sloop then being about four Miles from the Shoar, and the <HI>French</HI> Scooner bearing away from them, as the <HI>Indian</HI> Woman told him.</P>

<P>Which Examination was then Interpreted by Messieurs <HI>Lucy</HI> and <HI>Frazier,</HI> to to the said <HI>Baptist,</HI> who owned the same to be true.</P>
<P>Then the King's Advocate. Recapitulated the Evidences, and Replied upon the Prisoner's Advocate in the following manner.</P>
<Q><P><HI>May it please your Honours,</HI></P>
<P>THE Prisoners at the Bar having nothing further to offer, nor their Ad∣vocate for them, I shall therefore with all possible Brevity, discharge
<PB N="16" REF="002818_0015_0FE6500EE2C24CD8"/>
the remaining part of my Duty, in closing this Trial, that has thus long ex∣excised your Honours great Patience; and in order to this, I shall in the first Place recount the several principal Facts proved upon the Prisoners, and as I humbly conceive, unquestionably maintain my Charge against them, and lastly consider the Defence made by their Advocate for them. The Matters of Fact appear so Full and Irresistable, that neither the Prisoners themselves attempt to falsify them, or even to suggest any colourable Argument for their Extenua∣tion: And are such, that were they committed upon the High Sea, their Ad∣vocate concedes would clearly amount to Piracy.</P>
<P>And therefore I shall only summarily Mention to your Honours, that be∣sides the general Evidence against the Prisoners, of their Aiding, Assisting, Con∣curring and Assenting with others in the Taking, Robbing and Plundering the Sloop <HI>Tryal,</HI> mentioned in the Articles, it's proved particularly upon the Priso∣ners, they were the first that entered the said Vessel: That <HI>Baptist</HI> the Father, under a pretence of going ashoar in his Son's Canno, prevailed on the Master to leave him aboard; and to give the greater Terror to His Maje∣sty's Subjects, and Aggrandize himself, he made a Sash of the Ensign, and there∣in tuckt <HI>Roberts</HI>'s Pistol, assuming the Name of <HI>Skipper,</HI> ordered Mr. <HI>Doty</HI> to come to sail, and to steer the Sloop <HI>Eastward</HI>; and when a Scooner appeared in sight, he and his Son, with others, divided the Powder and Shot belonging to the Vessel, new flinted their Guns, converted the Fishing-Leads into Sluggs, and therewith loaded their Small-Arms: That he helped with others to bind the Mate of said Vessel, and also piratically robbed <HI>Roberts</HI> of two Rings and a pair of Stockings, and was active in consuming and destroying the Vessel's Provisions and Stores.</P>
<P>The Facts proved upon <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior, the other Prisoner, are for the most the same in Substance; more especially that he was originally let into the Secret, for when the Canno was but not half way in her return to the Sloop, then it was that a Gun was fired into the Air, and the <HI>English</HI> were required to cry for Quarters. That he was not only the Person confided in for bringing about their wicked Designs, but that he had so well executed that part that was judged the most Trusty, that he was left to stand Gentry over the Arms: That he charged his Father's Pistol; was Armed with a Gun; had on him a Cap, the Pro∣perty of one of the Men belonging to the Sloop; And finally, with a Fisher∣man's Pew made several attempts to destroy <HI>Sprague,</HI> even after he had Quar∣ters given. All which in the Law amount to several Acts of Piracy.</P>
<P>From whence it evidently appears, that the Articles in respect to Matters of Fact, are fully proved upon the Prisoners; but whether such Facts amount to Piracy at Sea, or Robbery at Land, in Point of Law, remains a Question; which naturally leads me to the Consideration of those Points in Law offered by the Prisoner's Advocate in their Defence.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002818_0016_0FE650126CA444B8"/>And First, he argues, that the Vessel when seized and taken by the Priso∣ners and others, was at an Anchor in the Port of <HI>Malegash,</HI> near the Land, and <HI>Infra Corpus Comitatus,</HI> and therefore is only Robbery at the Common Law.</P>
<P><Q>If a Pirate enters a Port or Haven, and Assaults and Robs a Merchant-Ship at Anchor there, this is no Piracy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March. Com. <HI>p. 183.</HI></NOTE> because it's not done <HI>Super Altum Mare,</HI> but a down right Robbery at the Common Law, and the Anonimous Author for this quotes <HI>Moor,</HI> 756.</Q></P>
<P>In Answer, the Case is not truly given us by that Author, as reported by Sir <HI>Francis Moor</HI>; neither is the Author in putting said Case consistent with himself; for his following Words are, <Q>And if the Crime be committed either <HI>Super Altum Mare,</HI> or in great Rivers within the Realm, which are looked up∣on as Common High-Ways, then it is Piracy.</Q> Which plainly militates with what the Author immediately before asserted for Law. But to return to the Case in <HI>Moor</HI>'s Reports; the first Question there put by the Lord Chancellour to all the Judges was, <HI>If the Clergy extended to Piracy, upon an Arraignment on the Stat.</HI> 28. H. 8. And Resolved, It did not, unless the Piracy was done in a Creek or other River, in which the Common Law before the <HI>Stat.</HI> had Jurisdiction; and not if it was done in <HI>Alto Mari,</HI> and out of the Body of the County. And these Words, <HI>In which the Common Law before the</HI> Stat. <HI>had Jurisdiction,</HI> fully im∣ply, since the <HI>Stat.</HI> the Common Law has not Jurisdiction. And the Words of the <HI>Stat.</HI> are, <Q>All Treasons, Felonies, Robberies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Committed in or upon the Sea, or in any other Haven, River, Creek or Place where the Admiral hath, or pretends to have Power, Authority, or Jurisdiction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Coke</HI> thereupon Comments thus; <Q>These Words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 <HI>Inst.</HI> 113. q.</NOTE> says he, (<HI>Or pretends to have,</HI> &amp;c.) are thus to be understood: Between the High-Water Mark and Low-Water Mark: For tho' the Land be <HI>Infra Corpus Commitatus</HI> at the Re-flow; yet when the Sea is full, the Admiral hath Jurisdiction <HI>super aquam,</HI> as long as the Sea flows.</Q> Now the Place where the Seizing and piratically Taking the Vessel in the Articles, was in the Port of <HI>Malegash,</HI> where the Sea is always full, and consequently within the Admiral's Jurisdiction. But the Books make a further distinction between Creeks, Ports and Ha∣vens, actually challenged as part of the Bodies of Counties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 140, 141. x.</NOTE> and from whence a Jury may come. And Ports, Creeks and Havens, that are out of every County, from whence no Jury can come, the former appertains (as is said) to the Jurisdiction of the Common Law Courts, the latter confessedly to the Admiralty. But if all Ports, Creeks and Harbours are generally and without this Distinction, out of the Admiralty's Jurisdiction, then these Words of the <HI>Stat.</HI> 28. <HI>H.</HI> 8. <Q>Upon the Sea, or in any other Ha∣ven, Creek, or other Place where the Admiral hath, or pretends to have Power, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> would be Vain and Idle, as also the Words of the <HI>Stat.</HI> of the 12, 13. <HI>W.</HI> 3. Ch. 7 which say, <Q>All Piracies. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Committed upon the Sea, or in any Haven, Creek or Place where the Admiral hath Jurisdiction, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>All which clearly shews, that there are such Havens, Rivers and Creeks where the Legislature supposes the Admiral to have Jurisdiction; and which
<PB N="18" REF="002818_0017_0FE65012A223B348"/>
most indisputably are such Havens, Rivers and Creeks, that (in my Lord <HI>Coke</HI>'s Words) are out of every County, and from whence no Jury can come; which is the Circumstance of the Port where this Vessel was piratically taken by the Prisoners. But what silences all Arguments of this Nature, in respect to the Admiralty's Jurisdiction in Ports, Creeks and Havens, touching Acts of Piracy, and removes all Pleas of this sort, are the Words of the <HI>Stat.</HI> 8. K. G. Ch. 24. Sect. 1. <Q>And if any Person belonging to any Ship or Vessel whatsoever, upon meeting any Merchant-Ship upon the High Seas, or in any Port, Haven or Creek whatsoever, shall forcibly Board and Enter into such Ship, and tho' they do not seize and carry her off, shall throw over-board or destroy any part of the Goods or Merchandizes belonging to such Ship, the Persons guil∣ty thereof, shall be deemed and punished as Pirates:</Q> And therefore I shall rest this part of the Prisoner's Defence, and proceed to the Consideration of the other Point of Law offered by their Advocate, and Calculated for <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior, namely, That he was at the time of the taking the said Vessel, an In∣fant under the Age of Fourteen, not <HI>sui juris,</HI> and by Law no Act of Piracy or Felony can be imputed to him.</P>
<P>To which I answer, The Gentleman is wrong in his Hypothesis, as by <HI>Evidentiâ Personae</HI>; neither did the Father or any other pretend to say the Priso∣ner was under the Age of Fourteen. And for as much as such a Special De∣fence is to exempt the Party from the Punishment of a General Statute, it's incumbent upon the Gentleman to make Legal Evidence of the Fact relied upon. But my Lord <HI>Hale,</HI> under <HI>Murther,</HI> says, <Q>An Infant within the Age of Discretion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hale</HI>'s Pleas of the Crown, <HI>p. 43.</HI></NOTE> kills a Man, no Felony; as if he be Nine or Ten Years old: But if by Circumstances it appear∣eth he could distinguish between Good and Evil, it is Felony; as if he hide the Dead, make Excuses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> That the Pirates looked upon this <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior as a Person capable of distinguishing, is evident by committing the greatest Trust and Charge unto him, namely, the Guard over the Arms; and that he could distinguish between Good and Evil, is plain, when he cry'd for Quarters, and afterwards when he thought himself sufficiently armed with a Fisherman's Pew, attempted the Destruction of <HI>Sprague,</HI> thereby as far as in him lay, preventing the regaining of the Vessel: By all which, and by many more incident Matters of Fact that turned out in the Evidence, it clearly appears he was a free Agent, and capable of making Legal Distinctions. And for as much as there is no Discrimination in respect to the Crimes charged upon the Prisoners, as Your Honour values the preser∣vation of the Laws of the Land, the Lives and Properties of His Majesty's Subjects, and would studiously avoid any fatal Consequence that may attend an illegal Acquittal; I hope there will be as little distinction in respect to their Sentence, but that Your Honour will justly pronounce them equally Guilty.</P></Q>
<P>The Advocate General having Concluded, the Court was cleared; and after mature and deliberate Consideration of what the King's Witnesses
<PB N="19" REF="002818_0018_0FE6501A8D249408"/>
Deposed, the Prisoners Defence made by themselves and their Advocate, together with the Replication of the Advocate General, the Court voted Unanimously, that the said <HI>John Baptist Jedre,</HI> alias <HI>Laverdure,</HI> and <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior, are severally Guilty of Piracy, Felony and Robbery, ac∣cording to the Articles Exhibited against them.</P>
<P>Then they were brought to the Bar again, and the President pronoun∣ced the said <HI>John Baptist Jedre,</HI> alias <HI>Laverdure,</HI> and <HI>John Baptist</HI> junior severally Guilty. — Whereupon the Advocate on Behalf of His Ma∣jesty moved, that Sentence might be given against them according to Law. Then they were severally askt if they had any thing further to say why Sentence of Death should not be pronounced against them, and they Alledging nothing but what was offered before in their behalf on their Tryal, the President pronounced Sentence against them severally in the words following, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>You— are to go from hence to the place from whence you came, and thence to the place of Execution, there to be hanged up by the Neck until you are Dead, and the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul.</Q></P>
<P>After Sentence was given against the Prisoners, the Marshal of the Ad∣miralty was Ordered to remand and keep them in safe Custody within His Majesty's Goal in <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Court was Adjourned to <HI>Wednesday,</HI> the fifth day of <HI>October</HI> Current, at ten a Clock in the Forenoon.</P>

Then the Witnesses for our Sovereign Lord the King, Namely, <HI>Samuel Doty, Nathaniel Sprague, John Roberts, Silas Cooke</HI> and <HI>Philip Sachimus</HI> were called and Sworn, and severally Deposed as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>SAmuel Doty</HI> saith, That on the 25th. day of <HI>August</HI> last, two of the Prisoners, <HI>viz. Philip Mews</HI> and <HI>James Mews,</HI> together with <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior, went on board the Deponent's Sloop in <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Canno Armed, and about a Gun shot from the Shoar, one of them held up his Gun and fired, and said to the said Deponent and his Company, then standing on the Bank, Now you <HI>English</HI> Men call for Quarter: And soon after they got on board the Sloop, they took down her Ensign, and fired a volley with their small Arms. That about a Quarter of an Hour afterwards, <HI>John Missel</HI> with three more <HI>Indians</HI> went aboard.</P>
<P>That sometime afterwards, when the Deponent went on board, <HI>James Mews,</HI> one of the Prisoners took the Deponents Hat from him, and spake to him in <HI>En∣glish</HI> saying, Now I am Captain of the Vessel, do you call your Men a board, or I'le send ashoar presently and kill them all.</P>
<P>That <HI>James Mews</HI> told the Deponent there was Peace Proclaimed between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI>; but the said <HI>Mews</HI> said he never would make Peace with the <HI>English,</HI> for the Governour of <HI>Boston</HI> kept his Brother, and he would Burn the Sloop and keep the Goods till his Brother was sent home.</P>
<P>That afterwards when the Deponent's Mate came on board, two of the Priso∣ners, <HI>viz. James Mews</HI> and <HI>Philip Mews,</HI> took hold of him and dragg'd him up∣on the Deck, threatning to kill him; and also told the Deponent that he would go on Shoar, and kill the rest of his Men that were there, unless he called them an board; and soon after they got on board, the Vessel came to sail by <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Order, and the said <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>James Mews</HI> hoisted up the Anchor.— That the said <HI>Philip Mews</HI> searched the Deponent's Pockets afterwards, and tools se∣venteen Shillings from him.— That <HI>John Baptist</HI> for the most part Ordered the Deponent what Course to Steer; Captain <HI>James Mews,</HI> as he called himself, having got Drunk.</P>
<P>That all the Prisoners in their turns, draw'd the Rum which belonged to the <HI>English</HI> Men; Drank plentifully, and eat of the Sloop's Cheese, Butter and other Provisions.— And lighted a great Number of Candles, which were burning all Night— That the next Morning they saw a Scooner which was supposed to be an <HI>English</HI> Vessel, and all the Prisoners (except <HI>James Mews</HI> who was then in Drink) divided the <HI>English</HI> Mens Arms, Powder and Shot, put new Flints into their Guns, and made ready to fight the <HI>English</HI> on board the said Vessel; <HI>John Missel</HI> in particular charged his Gun, but when they came up with her, they dis∣covered she was a <HI>French</HI> Scooner belonging to Cape <HI>Breton,</HI> that had lately been at <HI>Malegash</HI> for Cattle, as the Deponent understood. Then <HI>John Baptist</HI> Ordered the Deponent to Steer for <HI>Mahoon-Bay,</HI> near his Plantation — But soon after the <HI>English</HI> perceiving that <HI>Baptist,</HI> and three <HI>Indian</HI> Men were in the Cabbin, that <HI>James Mews</HI> and <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior were asleep upon Deck, and that <HI>John Mis∣sel</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="002818_0022_0FE65027F4B55CC8"/>
was a Fishing, and <HI>Philip Mews</HI> only was walking on the Deck, who with the said <HI>Baptist</HI> were Ordered to stand as a Guard over the <HI>English,</HI> they took this Opportunity to rise, and made themselves Masters of the Vessel, three of the <HI>In∣dians</HI> having jumpt over board out of the Cabbin Windows, and others being thrown from the Deck into the Hold.</P>
<P>That <HI>John Missel</HI> helpt to seize the Mate when he first went on board, and was as Active afterwards as the rest of the <HI>Indians</HI> upon all Occasions.— That the <HI>Indians</HI> struck the Mate several blows, hauled him by the Head and Shoul∣ders, and threatned to kill him with their Hatchets and Knives which they held in their Hands.</P>
<P><HI>NAthaniel Sprague</HI> Deposeth and saith, That on the 25th. of <HI>August</HI> last, when he got on Shoar it <HI>Malegash,</HI> he saw the three Prisoners now at the Bar, with other <HI>Indians</HI> on Shoar, and asked them what News, the said <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Phi∣lip Mews</HI> answered there was a very good Peace. The Deponent ask'd the <HI>Indians</HI> how they knew 'twas Peace? <HI>Philip Mews</HI> answered that the <HI>Penobscut</HI> and Cape <HI>Sable Indians</HI> had lately been at <HI>Annapolis</HI> with the Governour, who informed them he had made Peace with the <HI>Indians.</HI>— That the Depo∣nent heard <HI>John Baptist</HI> on board the Sloop call to his Son on Shoar, who soon after with <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Philip Mews</HI> went Armed in a Canno towards the Sloop. That one of them fired a Gun, and said to the <HI>English</HI> on Shoar: You <HI>English</HI> Men call for Quarter, and then went on board the Sloop, and he saw one of them take up an Ax and break open the Cabbin Door; then two of them went into the Cabbin; afterwards they struck the Colours, and discharged their small Arms.— That afterwards the Deponent saw two Cannos with <HI>Indians</HI> in them go on board the Sloop.— And some time after they sent on Shoar an <HI>Indian</HI> belonging to the Sloop, namely <HI>Philip Sachimus,</HI> to tell the <HI>English</HI> to come on board and they would give 'em good Quarter; but if they would not come on board, to inform them they should all be killed. Where∣upon the said Mr. <HI>Doty</HI> went on board.— And afterwards the said <HI>Doty</HI> called to the Deponent and <HI>Silas Cooke,</HI> and told them there were two <HI>Indians</HI> on Shoar would kill 'em, if they did not come on board; so they went on board, and some of the <HI>Indians</HI> stampt on the Deponent, others hauled him about, and held their Hatchets over his Head, threatning to kill him; but others came to his help— And particularly <HI>James Mews</HI> (one of the Prisoners at the Bar) threatned to kill him, and would have taken away his Life, (as this Deponent believes) had not another <HI>Indian</HI> Interposed. Afterwards the Depo∣nent got into the Hold, where he had not been long, before some of the Com∣pany bid him come upon Deck, and threatned if he did not they would cut him all to peices, so he went upon Deck, when <HI>James Mews</HI> and other <HI>Indians</HI> kickt him, and struck him several blows.— That <HI>Philip Mews</HI> stood by when <HI>Baptist</HI> bound him. And <HI>James Mews</HI> held a Knife to his▪ Throat, and told him he would be the Death of him; And once Swore at him, saying, God Dam your Blood, you shall not live a Minute longer, and struck at him
<PB N="24" REF="002818_0023_0FE65028227522F0"/>
with his Knife, but another <HI>Indian</HI> Interposed, and while they were striving together the Deponent got from them.</P>
<P>The Deponent further saith. That he saw the said <HI>James Mews</HI> have a Gold Ring, a pair of Silver Shoe-Buckles, and a Neckcloth belonging to <HI>John Roberts,</HI> and <HI>Philip Mews</HI> had a pair of Trowzers belonging to another of Mr. <HI>Doty</HI>'s Men.</P>
<P>That when the <HI>English</HI> rose upon the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians, James Mews</HI> was on the Windless, <HI>Philip</HI> was near him, and <HI>John Baptist</HI> Junior was lying upon or near his Gun.— <HI>Missel</HI> was on the Deck with a Gun in one Hand, and a Fishing line in the other, a Fishing.</P>
<P>That the Deponent saw Mr. <HI>Doty</HI> leave the Helm, and put to the Cabbin Door, and he took hold of <HI>Philip Mews</HI> Gun, but he flung Mr. <HI>Doty</HI> on the Floor, then <HI>Roberts</HI> and <HI>Cooke</HI> went to the said <HI>Doty</HI>'s Assistance; <HI>John Missel</HI> in the Interim went to the Cabbin Door, and endeavoured to open it, but was hindred by an <HI>Indian</HI> belonging to Mr. <HI>Doty,</HI> viz. <HI>Philip Sachimus,</HI> who stood by the Door; But <HI>Baptist</HI> got out at the Cabbin Door, and was soon thrown over board— The Deponent further saith, That <HI>John Missel,</HI> with a Gauft struck the Deponent, and tried to haul him into the Hold with it, but the Deponent having a Fisherman's Pew in his Hand, struck at the said <HI>Missel,</HI> who fell backward, and so escaped the blow.</P>
<P><HI>JOhn Roberts</HI> Deposeth and saith, That when he went ashoar at <HI>Malegash,</HI> he saw the three Prisoners, with three other <HI>Indians</HI> and two <HI>French</HI> Men, and the Deponent shook Hands with <HI>Philip Mews,</HI> and ask'd him whether there was Peace? He answered (in the hearing of other <HI>Indians</HI>) there was a good Peace, and that now the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> were all one Brothers. That afterwards the said <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Philip Mews</HI> and Young <HI>Baptist</HI> put off from the Shoar in a Canno, and some distance from the Shoar one of them fired a Gun, and bid the <HI>English</HI> call for Quarter. That the Deponent afterwards saw them go aboard the Sloop, and <HI>James Mews</HI> with an Ax cut open the Cabbin Door, and <HI>Philip Mews</HI> and <HI>John Baptist</HI> struck the Colours.— That the Depo∣nent with <HI>Philip Sachimus,</HI> and another <HI>Indian</HI> belonging to the Sloop, returned on board the Sloop when she was under Sail going out of the Harbour, about eight a Clock at Night.— That when he got on board, <HI>Philip Mews</HI> and <HI>John Missel,</HI> two of the Prisoners, took hold of him, and thrust him into the Fore-castle.</P>
<P>That afterwards <HI>James Mews</HI> called him Son of a Bitch, struck him several blows, and threatned to kill him.— That <HI>Philip Mews</HI> stood Century with the Deponent's Gun.— That <HI>James Mews</HI> had the Deponent's Ring, a pair of Buckles and a Handkerchief.— That <HI>John Missel,</HI> in his turn, stood Century with his Gun.— That <HI>Philip Mews</HI> took a Plush pair of Breeches, and a pair of Trowzers from him.</P>
<P>That <HI>Baptist</HI> order'd the Deponent to go to <HI>James Mews</HI> for Bread, who took up a Bag with the Bisket in it, and beat him round the Cabbin, calling him Son of a Bitch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="002818_0024_0FE6502966F30220"/>That <HI>Philip Mews</HI> told the Deponent, when they saw the Scooner which they took for an <HI>English</HI> Vessel, that they would kill the <HI>English</HI> and give Mr. <HI>Doty</HI> and his Men their Sloop again.</P>
<P><HI>SIlas Cooke</HI> Deposeth and saith, That the Shot and Powder belonging to the <HI>English</HI> was divided by <HI>Missel</HI> and others; And afterwards when they went in quest of another Vessel, he shew'd his Satisfaction at it.</P>

<P><HI>JAmes Mews, Indian,</HI> Examined saith, That he lived at <HI>Malegash,</HI> that about twelve or thirteen days agone, he with five more <HI>Indians</HI> bought of the <HI>French</HI> there a Bottle of Rum, and were going over a carrying place when <HI>John Baptist</HI> and others called to them, and told them there was an <HI>English</HI> Vessel coming into the Harbour of <HI>Malegash,</HI> and the said <HI>Baptist</HI> and his Son <HI>John,</HI> his Brothers <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Gold,</HI> and his Son in Law <HI>Augustine,</HI> all living at <HI>Malegash,</HI> gave the Examinant and the other five <HI>Indians</HI> a Bottle of Rum, and over per∣swaded them to turn back and go on board the Sloop, and told them, now was their time to get Provisions.— The Examinant further saith, That the said <HI>John Baptist</HI> and his Son went first aboard the Sloop, which had <HI>English</HI> Colours, and struck the Colour or Ensign, and tied it round his middle: That afterwards the Examinant with <HI>Salmon</HI> and <HI>Lewn</HI> went aboard in one Canno; and three more <HI>Indians, viz.

Mr. <HI>Baptist</HI> and his Son first went on board the Sloop.— <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Son came on Shoar, and talk'd with the <HI>Indians</HI> as they were going over a carrying place, but he was at some distance, so don't know what was said.— Then <HI>James Mews</HI> and his Brother <HI>Philip</HI> wert on board with <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Son; before which time the <HI>English</HI> were come on Shoar in their Canno.— That he and <HI>Salmon,</HI> with a Squaw and two Children went on board in a Canno, being first called upon by <HI>Baptist</HI> to come on board.— That <HI>James Mews</HI> or <HI>Baptist</HI> hail'd the <HI>Indians</HI> on Shoar, and told 'em they had taken the Vessel, and bid 'em come on board; When they called, <HI>Baptist</HI> and <HI>Philip</HI> took the Colours down; and when he came on board, <HI>Baptist</HI> tyed 'em round his middle. He knows not who tied the <HI>Indian</HI> belonging to the Sloop.— That when it was Even∣ing, the English came on board.— That the <HI>French</HI> made a Prisoner of the Master <HI>Doty,</HI> at an Old Woman's House, and she with her Son and the Master went on board together. That <HI>James Mews</HI> said, lets come to Sail, and gave orders to hoist the Anchor, and <HI>Marsel</HI> and <HI>Lewis</HI> help'd to weight it with <HI>Salmon.</HI> They were to go to <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Plantation round the Point. The next day in the Morning early they saw a Vessel, which proved to be a Vessel which the <HI>French</HI> said they saw some days before.— Some of the <HI>Indians</HI> fitted their Arms, saying, that if it was an <HI>English</HI> Vessel they believ'd she would fight 'em, seeing the <HI>Indians</HI> had taken the Sloop.—— That <HI>Baptist</HI> perswaded them to carry the Sloop round towards his Plantation, but soon after Breakfast was over, some of them were Drunk, and he and <HI>Philip</HI> were Fishing, and three <HI>Indian</HI> Men and the Squaw and two Children, with <HI>John Baptist,</HI> were in the Cabbin, and the Skipper shut the Cabbin Door upon 'em; that the <HI>English</HI> were all upon Deck, and struck him down, that <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Son were asleep forward.—
<PB N="29" REF="002818_0028_0FE6503216C89C70"/>
That the said <HI>Baptist</HI> came out of the Cabbin, and was knockt down and thrown over board, the <HI>English</HI> fired into the Cabbin, and three <HI>Indians</HI> thereupon got out of the Cabbin Windows; there was one Canno adrift, which the <HI>Indians</HI> tryed to get into, but the Canno oversat; 'twas not far from the <HI>French</HI> Vessel, but he believes the People on board did not see the <HI>Indians</HI>; 'twas about a Mile from the Shoar, and he believes they were Drowned — He had his share of the <HI>English's</HI> Powder and Shot, but he had no Gun.— He heard the <HI>Indians</HI> had been at <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> and heard some of them say that there was Peace with the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> But he heard some of the <HI>Indians</HI> say they won∣dred that if there was Peace, they did not bring the <HI>Indian</HI> Prisoners from <HI>Boston.</HI></P>

<P>After Reading the above Examinations, the Prisoners were severally Askt whether the same were true? And altho' their Advocate advised them, that they were not obliged to own in Court, what they owned before the Justices aforesaid; Yet they severally acknowledged that their Examinations were true.</P>
<P>Then was Read the Ratification made the fourth day of <HI>June</HI> last, at His Majesty's Fort of <HI>Annapolis-Royal,</HI> of the Articles of Peace stipulated by the Delegates at <HI>Boston,</HI> the fifteenth day of <HI>December</HI> foregoing, (which Articles were also Read) in behalf of the <HI>Penobscot, Narridgwalk,</HI> Saint <HI>John</HI>'s, Cape <HI>Sables,</HI> and other <HI>Indian</HI> Tribes belonging to, and Inhabiting within His Majesty's Territories of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> &amp;c. And by Major <HI>Paul Mascarene,</HI> Commissioner for the Province of <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> in behalf of His Majesty.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="002818_0029_0FE650324BA4D1D8"/>Afterwards the Prisoners being ask'd whether they had seen any of the <HI>Indians</HI> that were at the Ratification of the Peace at <HI>Annapolis</HI>? They answered, they had been in Company with several of the <HI>Indians,</HI> whose Names were subscribed to the said Ratification; And particularly <HI>James Mews</HI> owned, that about twenty days before the said <HI>Doty</HI>'s Sloop was taken, he was in Company with <HI>Antoin,</HI> one of the Chiefs of the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Menis,</HI> and about eight or ten days afterwards, he saw <HI>Indian Simon,</HI> who used to carry Letters from <HI>Menis,</HI> &amp;c. to <HI>Annapolis-Royal,</HI> and was present, as he understood, at the Negotiation of the Peace; and the said <HI>James</HI> and <HI>Philip Mews,</HI> both signified to the Court their belief that <HI>Antoin</HI> was at <HI>Annapolis</HI> treating of the Peace; and they also own∣ed, that they lately saw Captain <HI>Walker,</HI> alias <HI>Piere,</HI> one of the Chiefs of the <HI>Indians</HI> at or near <HI>Malegash</HI> and <HI>Sabuckatook,</HI> who was at <HI>Annapo∣lis</HI> at the Treaty; and that his Brother <HI>Catouse</HI> was returned from thence, since the Ratification of the Peace.</P>
<P>Then the Prisoners Advocate made his Pleas in their Defence, in the following manner, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>I Now a second Time appear before Your Honour, Mr. President, and the rest of the Honourable Commissioners of this Court, in behalf of some Persons accused of Piracy: Who tho' they be <HI>Indians,</HI> have and will experi∣ence so much Candour and Indulgence from this Court, as must convince even the barbarous and Salvage Tribes to which they belong, of Your great Justice and Impartiality. Your Honours, I doubt not, are sensible I am not send of this Office: But my Duty to Your Honour, and the Honourable Court, and desire that nothing may be neglected, which in Justice to the Pri∣soners ought to be declared, engage me in this Affair.</P>
<P>I humbly submit it to Your Honours, Whether at the Time the Facts they are accused of, are laid to be committed, they were not Enemies, or in a State of War with us: 'Tis true it appears, that the Ratification of the Peace between His Majesty's Government of <HI>Annapolis-Royal,</HI> and the Cape <HI>Sable In∣dians,</HI> was made at <HI>Annapolis</HI> on the fourth of <HI>June</HI> last; but that regards that Government only; and the Covenant on the part of the <HI>Indians,</HI> that they not commit Hostilities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> extends to the Inhabitants of that Province only. The Vessel seized at <HI>Malegash,</HI> in which the Evidences for the King were, belongs to His Majesty's Subjects of this Province: And the Prisoners declare, that at the Time of the taking Capt. <HI>Doty</HI> and his Vessel, they nei∣ther knew or heard of the Ratification of the Peace between this Province and the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Cas<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>; but on the contrary, were informed even by <HI>Eng∣lish
<PB N="31" REF="002818_0030_0FE6503C95D9D388"/>
men,</HI> as well as <HI>French,</HI> among the latter of which, were (as they inform me) Monsieur St. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e</HI> of <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> and his Son <HI>John Baptist,</HI> and by two eminent Cape <HI>Sable</HI> Indians, <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>age</HI> and <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>age,</HI> that there was no Peace made, but only talked of; and that but a Day or two before the Facts are charged in the Articles to be committed.</P>
<P>The Ratification indeed at <HI>Cases,</HI> was on the fifth of <HI>August,</HI> but that does not argue that the Prisoners were acquainted with it, they living in a far, re∣mote and distant Place of another Government: And being but an inconside∣rable Number of People, the Law will not, with Submission, presume a Per∣son to be knowing of a thing, unless there appear some Circumstances by which it may be reasonably concluded, he cannot but know it. If therefore the Prisoners were in a State of War with us, what they have done, they may well justify, by the Laws of GOD, Nature, Nations and Arms: And their declaring to <HI>Doty</HI> and his Men, that it was Peace, may be reasonably accounted a Stratagem of War, to draw and ensnare them in their Churches; which fort of Stratagems are very frequently made use of in War.</P>
<P>Your Honours may well remember what I urged yesterday in favour of the two <HI>French-men,</HI> which therefore I shall not spend Your Time in insisting on, since the Sentence You have passed upon them, manifests it to be over-ruled; I mean, that the Fact charged being committed within the Body of a County, amounts only to a Notorious Robbery, which is triable at the Common-Law by a Jury, and not to Piracy: And herewith agrees the Definition of Piracy, given by Mr. Advocate General. I shall only beg leave to add to what I then said, That as the Fact was certainly begun when the Vessel was at Anchor in the Harbour; so it being but one continued Act, ought to be tried where it was begun, <HI>i. e.</HI> within the Body of the County.</P>
<P>The Carriage of the Prisoners to the Men, was very Unjustifiable in their beating of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But this I attribute partly to their barbarous Natures and Customs, and partly to their Drink. <HI>John Missel</HI> seems to have had the least share in the Affair, he not coming on board till after the Colours were struck: But I shall leave their Cases to Your Honour's wise Consideration, and doubt not of a Judgment equal to the Merit and Justice thereof.</P>
<P>Afterwards the Prisoners being ask'd, if they had any thing to say for themselves, more than their Advocate had observed on their behalf?— <HI>James Mews</HI> said, he was in Liquor; and they all excused themselves by alledging, that it was the first Offence of that Nature they had been Guilty of, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Afterwards the King's Advocate Reply'd upon the Prisoners Advo∣cate, as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="32" REF="002818_0031_0FE6503CBB97DFE8"/>
<P>May it please Your Honour, Mr. <HI>President,</HI> and the Honourable Com∣missioners,</P>
<P>I Shall not now Trespass upon Your Patience, in reiterating the several Matters of Fact proved upon the Prisoners: And more espe∣cially when I consider they turn out as strong, if not stronger against them, than against those two that justly received their Sentence Yester∣day.— And of this their Advocate is perfectly convinced, and there∣fore industriously waves any Advantage that otherwise may be taken to the weakness of the Evidence; and rests their Defence on an Allega∣tion, That at the Time of Committing these Facts, they were in a State of Enmity with us, ignorant of the Ratification of the Peace, and therefore not guilty of Piracy, by the Law of Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>To which I Answer:— That the Gentleman is the second Time mistaken in Fact. For on the Fifteenth Day of <HI>December,</HI> 1725. the several Tribes of the Eastern <HI>Indians,</HI> St. <HI>John</HI>'s and Cape <HI>Sables,</HI> &amp;c. by their Delegates, did enter into Articles of Pacification at <HI>Boston,</HI> with the Governments of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay, New-Hampshire</HI> and <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> whereby among other things, they promised in behalf of their respective Tribes, <Q>That they will cease all Acts of Hostility, Injuries and Discords, towards all the Subjects of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and not offer the least Hurt, Violence or Molestation to them, or any of them, in their Persons or Estates; but will henceforward Hold and Maintain a firm, constant Amity and Friendship with all the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> and will never Confederate or Combine with any other Nation to their Prejudice.</Q> And further, there are also inserted in the said Articles of Pacification these Words, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>We (meaning the said Delegates, in behalf of themselves and their respective Tribes) Sub∣mitting our selves to be Ruled and Governed by His Majesty's Laws, and desiring to have the Benefit of the same.</Q> And on the fourth Day of <HI>June</HI> following, at <HI>Annapolis-Royal,</HI> the Chiefs and Representatives of the said <HI>Indians,</HI> in Compliance with the said Articles, stipulated as aforesaid, by their Delegates, and in Obedience thereunto, Solemnly Confirmed and Ratified the same. By all which it most evidently ap∣pears, that the <HI>Indians</HI> were not, as pretended, at the Time of execu∣ting the several Acts of Piracy charged upon them, in a State of War with the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> but in firm Amity with His Sacred Majesty, and to be Governed by His Majesty's Laws, and Entituled to the Benefit of them.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="002818_0032_0FE6503F08CDC0F0"/><Q>And if any Foreigner, Subject to any Prince or State in Amity with the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> commit Piracies on the Ships or Goods of the <HI>English,</HI> the same is Piracy, within the Stat. 28. <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>Sea-Laws,</HI> p. 478. <HI>q.</HI></Q> Having thus unanswerably acquitted this Prosecution from the Exception, I beg leave to give a shot Answer to what further was offered by the Advocate for the Prisoners, under this Head, namely, that they were ignorant of these Negotiations, and therefore the Crime of Piracy ought not to be imputed to them.</P>
<P>I must observe to Your Honours, It's a settled Maxim in respect to the Breaches of Penal-Laws, <HI>Ignorantia non excusat Legem.</HI> And was the Fact truly so, who is chargeable with the Omission? The Chiefs and Delegates in Duty ought to apprize (as doubtless they did) their re∣spective Tribes, of the said Articles of Pacification and Confirma∣tion, and not the Government that stipulated with them. But from their own Words, and Words spoke in their hearing, as appeared in the Evidence, and also from the Circumstances in the Case, it must be collected they were fully sensible of all these Solemn Treaties and Proceedings; for ashoar one of them saluted the <HI>English</HI> as the <HI>French</HI> did aboard, by saying, <HI>It's Peace; the</HI> English <HI>are now all one as Bro∣thers</HI>: And by their own Acknowledgement, they had seen and con∣versed with some of their Chiefs, that had at <HI>Annapolis</HI> Confirmed the said Articles of Pacification since such Confirmation, and once in par∣ticular, but a very inconsiderable Time before their perpetrating this their wicked Act; so that there is neither Colour or Shadow to sup∣pose them Ignorant; or according to Law would such Ignorance ex∣empt them from the Punishment justly due to their Demerits.</P>
<P>Therefore I doubt not but Your Honours will in like manner declare them Guilty, as You lately have the other Accomplices in these their wicked Actions.</P></Q>
<P>The Advocate General having Concluded, the Court was cleared; Then the Commissioners fully and deliberately weighed and considered the Evidences against the Prisoners, and also the Defence made by them and their Advocate, together with Mr. Advocate General's Replication, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And Voted Unanimously, That the said <HI>James Mews, Philip Mews,</HI> and <HI>John Missel,</HI> were severally Guilty.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="002818_0033_0FE6503F37E0F650"/>Then the Prisoners were brought to the Bar again, when the President Pronounced them severally Guilty of Piracy, Felony and Robbery, ac∣cording to the Articles Exhibited against them.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Advocate General on His Majesty's behalf, demanded Sentence against them.</P>
<P>And the Prisoners when ask'd what they had further to say, why Sen∣tence of Death should not be Pronounced against them, alledging, they had nothing to say more than had been offered upon their Trial; The President of the Court accordingly Pronounced Sentence against them severally, in the Words following, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>You — are to go from hence to the place from whence you came, and from thence to the place of Execution, and there to be hanged up by the Neck, until you are Dead; and the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul.</Q></P>
