<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>AS</HI> it is not the Design of the following Sheets to cast the popular Odium on either of the Parties, but merely to expose the Attempt to obtain Redress in behalf of the Defendant, and in his Absence, against a legal Determination of the Suit, by a Method entirely new, unconstitutional and illegal; a particular Detail of the Evi∣dence on both Sides is carefully avoided.</P>
<P>The strange and unnatural Construction which has been lately given to his Majesty's Royal Order, with a View to countenance the Appeal sought for in behalf of the Defendant, and the dangerous Tendency of such a Construction, are the Objects which the Editor has in View. This Construction must indeed be alarming to every British Subject; who, among the many invaluable Privileges, by which he is distinguished from the Subjects of other Princes, will naturally esteem a Trial by his Peers as one of the greatest — In short it is a Construction which subverts the antient and fundamental Law of the Land, renders all Property in the Colonies precarious and of little Value, and the Method of obtaining Justice extremely dilatory, and exten∣sively ruinous to the Litigants.</P>
<P>But to shew the pernicious Consequences of this Construction, Arguments need not here be urged — His Honour the Chief Justice has, in the legal Discharge of his important Trust, assigned such Reasons, as must be sufficient to expose the false and pernici∣ous Doctrine, <HI>that the Crown by its Instruction designed to change the Laws of the Land, or to execute Justice by other Means than are known in the Mother Country.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="041438_0004_101A88C2F6C1B340"/>As such of the Proceedings in this Cause as are here submitted to the public Scrutiny, were had in the King's Courts of Justice; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Editor thought it his Duty, to improve the Opportunity which the Law gives him, of commanding authenticated Copies, to com∣municate them to the World. By this Means, as well those who are entitled to enjoy, as those whose Duty it is to protect them in the Possession of, their invaluable Rights and Privileges, may be apprised of this unexampled Attempt to divert the Channel of Justice.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Thomas Forsey, against Waddel Cunningham.</HI> Report of an Action of Assault, Battery and Wounding, tried in the Supreme Court of New-York, October <HI>1764.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Suit was brought for a violent Assault, Battery, and Wounding, committed by the Defendant on the Plaintiff, on the 28th Day of July 1763. The Chief Justice, on a Petition and Affidavit of the Violence of the Battery, gave his Order for holding the Defendant to Bail, in £.5000.</P>
<P>Upon the Return of the Writ in October Term 1763, the Plaintiff declared, in the usual Form; and after an Imparlance to January Term following, the Defendant pleaded the general Issue, Not Guilty.</P>
<P>In April Term 1764, the Defendant moved the Court for a struck Jury, which Motion was granted, and a Jury was accordingly struck during the Term.</P>
<P>In October Term following, the Cause came on regularly, to be tried by the Jury that had been struck at the Defendant's Request.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="041438_0006_101A88C7C6D680E8"/>The Trial lasted near twelve Hours, in the Course of which, the Proof of the Battery was so full and clear, that the Defendant relied only on some Evidence in Mitigation of Damages, in the Production of which, the fullest and fairest Scope was given to him.</P>
<P>There were three Gentlemen, of Council for the Plaintiff, and four for the Defendant; the Witnesses on both Sides were very fully and circumstantially examined, and the Evid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce as fully and circumstantially summed up by the Council, for both Parties: The Jury went from the Bar late in the Evening, and returned to it the next Morning with their privy Verdict; by which they found the Defendant Guilty of the Trespass, Assault, Battery and Wounding charged in the Plaintiff's Decla∣ration; and assessed the Plaintiff's Damages, at one thousand five hun∣dred Pounds, and his Costs at six Pence.</P>
<P>On Saturday, the last Day of the Term, the Defendant's Council moved the Court, to set aside the Verdict, for the Largeness of the Damages; but the Court conceiving that the Damages were not exces∣sive, rejected the Motion, and ordered Judgment to be entered for the Plaintiff. The Defendant being absent beyond Sea, Robert R. Waddel who acts for him under a Letter of Attorney, then came up to the Bench; and presented to the Judges, a Petition to admit an Entry of an Appeal to the Governor and Council, and a Bond with Security, as grounded upon the Instruction. The Court suffered no Entry to be made, and returned the Papers; declaring no such Appeal would lie, and that the Instruction was not designed to favour any other, than a Re∣moval by Writ of Error—The Instruction is in these Words.</P>

<P>The Chief Justices proceeded to finish the Taxation, notwithstand∣ing the Service of this Instrument, and signed the Judgment.

<HEAD>REASONS offered by <HI>Daniel Horsmanden,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Chief Justice of the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> to his Honour the Lieutenant Governor and the Honourable His Majesty's Coun∣cil for the said Province, against returning an Instrument under Seal, whereby all Proceedings on the Verdict lately obtained by the said <HI>Thomas Forsey,</HI> against the said <HI>Waddel Cunningham</HI> in the Supreme Court, are commanded to be stayed, and ano∣ther Instrument under Seal, whereby the Justices of the said Supreme Court are commanded to cause the Proceedings where∣on the said Verdict was founded, to be bro't before tne Lieu∣tenant Governor and the Council.</HEAD>
<P>I beg Leave to perfix a State of the Proceedings between the Parties, not only, the more clearly to avail myself of those Reasons, but also, in Compliance with my Oath of Office, by which I am bound to certify the King's Majesty, of the Proceedings, on which those Instruments (which I consider as Letters in Delay of Justice) are said to be grounded.</P>
<P>On Wednesday last, I brought into this Court those Letters, and as both the Prohibition, and Command, appeared to me unwarrantable, I thought it my Duty to obey neither, but to lay the Instruments be∣fore you, and to assign my Reasons, for the Part I acted, on this new, and extraordinary Occasion. —The Liberty you gave me to reduce the Substance of what I then offered to Writing, as it affords me an Oppor∣tunity, to express myself with greater Perspicuity, is an Indulgence, for which I return your Honour and the Council my hearty Thanks.</P>
<P>The Suit which occasioned those Letters to the Judges (for they are directed to us all) was an Action of Trespass brought in the Supreme Court; in which the Plantiff Forsey declared for an Assault, Battery, and wounding, to his Damage £.5000; upon which the Cause was at issue on the Plea of not Guilty; and the Jurors in the last Term of October, found for the Plantiff, and assessed his Damages at £. 1500.</P>
<P>The Pannel consisted of a special Jury of Freeholders, at the Defendant's Request —No Challenges were made to either of them— The Trial took up twelve Hours — No Evidence that was offered, by either Party was refused to be admitted by the Court — All the Judges were upon the Bench —The Plantiff had three, and the Defendant four Gentlemen attending as their Council —The Proofs were largely
<PB N="9" REF="041438_0013_101A88D915D18E58"/>
summed up on both Sides; and the Bar, and Country, must unanimously declare, that the Trial was regular, and solemn; and conducted with the utmost Fairness and Deliberation.</P>
<P>On the 27st of the Month, tho' the last Day of the Term, on which no special Motions are made, the Council for the Defendant were indul∣ged with a Motion for a new Trial. But no Reason being assigned, but a Complaint that the Damages were excessive (which did not appear to the Court to be well founded) and the Trespass being very atrocious, and the Proofs clear, the Court over-ruled the Motion.</P>
<P>It affords strong Ground of Presumption that the Process and Plead∣ings are regular, since no Writ of Error has been yet offered to us — The Verdict of the Jury must therefore be the sole Cause of Complaint; and Relief against that, is now expected from your Honours.</P>
<P>This seems to be founded upon an erroneous Interpretation of the thirty second Instruction, given by his Majesty to the Governor of this Pro∣vince: A Construction which I could not countenance, by an Obe∣dience to the Letters sent to me; for the following Reasons,</P>
<P N="1">I. Because it supposes the Royal Order to aim at altering the antient and wholesome Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>By the common Law of England the Trial of Facts is entrusted to the Jury; and the Power to declare the Law upon them, is committed to the King's Judges—These are distinct Provinces; and the Limits be∣tween them guarded by invariable Usage and the most incontestible Au∣thorities—The Errors of the Judges may be corrected by superior Judicatories; as for Instance, those of the King's Bench in the Ex∣chequer Chamber, and by the House of Peers—But in all those Removes, the Verdict of the Jurors suffers no Re-examination, but is final and decisive:—This is the Law at Home.</P>
<P>The Supreme Court here proceeds in the Main, according to the Practice of the Courts at Westminster; and the Common Law of Eng∣land, with the Statutes affirming, or altering it, before a Legislature was established here, and those passed since such Establishment, ex∣pressly extended to us, with our legislative Acts (which are not to be repugnant to the Laws of England) constitute the Laws of this Colony: And tho' there are many Instances of Judgments, reversed and affirmed,
<PB N="10" REF="041438_0014_101A88DBB063E0E0"/>
in a Course of Error, before the Governor and Council, I do affirm, with the highest Confidence, that not one Verdict was ever re-examined by any superior Judicatory in the Province.</P>
<P>An Attempt then to re-examine the Verdict of a Jury, is repugnant to the Laws, both of England and this Colony — This is well known to the Crown;—and to suppose that his Majesty designed to change the Law, and that too in one of its most important Articles, is certainly absurd, and being dangerous both to the Prerogatives of the Crown and the Liberty and Safety of the Subject; it is in my humble Opinion highly criminal to assert, that the King's Order has any such Aim. Nor,</P>
<P N="2">II. Is there any Shadow of Reason, from the Words of the Instruction, to countenance such a bold Interpretation.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the Governor is to permit and allow Appeals from the Courts of common Law; and who can deny, but that in Common Speech, the bringing of a Writ of Error, as it carries the Cause from a lower to a superior Tribunal, is an Appeal?—And surely that must be the best Explication, which satisfies the Term, without altering the Law; especially if we consider that the Royal Instructions, given before the Year 1753, adopted that very Term, as applicable to Cases of Error, the Words of the former Instructions running thus: You are
<Q>to al∣low Appeals, in Case of Errors, from any of the Courts of Common Law</Q>
and that such is the meaning of the Appeals mentioned in the present Instruction as it is understood by his Majesty in Council, will appear from the case of <HI>Gordon</HI> —and <HI>Lowther,</HI> 2d Lord <HI>Raymond</HI> 1447. Add to this that the present Instruction, does itself refute the Interpre∣tation upon which this Measure is founded; for you'll be pleased to observe,
<Q><P N="1">1st. That the Truth is, that all the Appeals we have had (I ex∣cept none) have been in Error, and prosecuted by Writs of Error, and it being his Majesty's Pleasure that the Governor upon Ap∣peals shall
<Q>issue a Writ in the Manner which has been usually accustomed.</Q>
No other Appeal, than by such Writ, is directed.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Judges of the Supreme Court, though Members of the Council, are forbid to Vote on the Decision above:
<PB N="11" REF="041438_0015_101A88DE4449AFD0"/>
for which I can assign no other Reason, than because they are supposed to have prejudiced the Cause, especially as Leave is nevertheless given them, to render the Reasons of their Judg∣ment, as the Judges do in <HI>England,</HI> upon Error brought before the Peers. And as they are only Judges of the Law and not Triers of the Facts; these Clauses evidently imply, that the Appeal given, is only in Error, and not upon the Verdict of the Jury.</P></Q></P>
<P>Besides this, numberless Objections against a contrary Construction may be drawn <HI>ab Inconvenienti,</HI>—Permit me to mention a few;</P>
<P N="1">I. Who is ignorant that in the Courts of Common Law, the Evidence of the Witnesses to the Jury, is all <HI>viva voce?</HI>— It results therefore, that they can transmit nothing but a Transcript of the Record, which contains no Part of the Proofs—The Court above, remains then uninformed of the Facts upon which The Verdict was given, and cannot adjudge upon them with∣out a Re-examination of the Witnesses, against that Attempt several Objections instantly occur.—I will hint at but two;
<Q><P N="1">1st. The Cause must be made <HI>Res integra:</HI> For the Want of written Memorials of the first Evidence, renders it impossi∣ble to confine the Proofs above, to what they were in the first Production to the Jury. — And so the Trouble and Charge of the Trial to the Parties, Court and Country, were all to no Purpose,—And,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. It tends to open a Flood-Gate to Perjury:—For both Parties being now apprised of the Proofs which were secret 'till the first Trial, every Effort will be made to blacken the Character of the most material Witnesses, and to supply all former Deficiencies.</P>
<P>And from these Sources such Streams will flow, as would extort the Groans of all, who delight in the due Administra∣tion of Justice.</P></Q></P>
<P N="2">IIdly. The Appeal contended for, impeaches the Wisdom of our Law in that distinguishing Article of Trials by Jury; since all Verdicts in Causes above the Value of £. 300 Sterling would be worse than in Vain.</P>

<P N="4">IVthly. The Expence attending such Appeals will be intolerable— As the Proofs before the Governor and Council must necessarily be reduced to Writing, to Form what <HI>Civilians</HI> call the <HI>Apos∣tella,</HI> for the next Remove of the Cause to his Majesty in privy Council; It will follow, that according to their Usage, there must also be Interrogatories, cross Interrogatories, Examinati∣ons, and cross Examinations, and the Production of Exhibits— And he that is acquainted with the Process of the civil Law Courts, will readily agree, that the Evidence introduced on a common Law Trial, of Twelve or Twenty-four Hours, especially, when Titles to real Estates are in Question, and Deeds offered, will, if reduced to Writing, swell the <HI>Apostels,</HI> to a Size so enormous, that the Trouble and Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, will often surpass the Value of the Thing in demand. And it may be of Use to observe here, (as a farther Proof, that it was not the Object of the Instruction, to allow Appeals upon the whole Merits;) that you have not Officers to transact the Business, that would thereby be introduced; the Court of the Governor and Council, having neither a Register, nor Examiner, to this Day, appointed by the Crown.</P>
<P N="5">V. It would be impossible for those Courts of Appeal to discharge the Duty to which they would in such Case be obliged. — The Governor and Council must sit <HI>de Die in Diem</HI> all the Year round, for the Business of their Colony — And how then can his Majesty in privy Council, besides attending to the arduous Affairs of his Kingdoms, examine all the tedious Complaints brought up from all the Provinces for his Royal Decision?</P>
<P N="6">VI. To what an amazing Insecurity and Danger must the Subject according to this Project, be reduced and exposed?</P>
<Q>Let me specify a few Instances;</Q>
<P N="1">1st. As the Expence, so the Delays, will be infinite—How great then the Encouragement for Contention? What wrongful Possessor and de∣bauched Tenant, will give up his unjust Defence? What Trespasser will pay the Damages of an injured Plantiff, when as in this Case, the
<PB N="13" REF="041438_0017_101A88E6202C5400"/>
Death of either Party is the perpetual Extinction, not only of the Suit depending, but the very Cause of Action? What Loser will not appeal upon the bear Presumption that the first Witnesses against him may be dead, or absent, on the new Trial?</P>
<P N="2">2d. Witnesses of good and bad Characters, will have, in Effect, equel Credit with the Judges; for they and those by whose Testimony they are to be supported, or discredited, will all be unknown by the Judges, who are to pronounce upon their Evidence on Appeal.</P>
<P N="3">3d. New Modes of introducing Proof will necessarily establish new Rules relative to them; and as all special Laws, cannot be foreseen nor provided for; the Subject will be tried by new Laws, and often by Laws unpromulged; or to speak more properly, by the Dictate of Power without Law.</P>
<P>These are some of the Reasons which induce me to be of Opinion, that the King's Instructions do not countenance the Exercise of any Ju∣dicial Authority to reverse the Verdict of a Jury: — And as they give me the fullest Satisfaction,—I shall forbear assigning any other, tho' there are many — The first is sufficient for us, who sit as Judges — The Law warrants no such Letters, as those which the Defendant sued out, and delivered to me — We have taken the Oath, prescribed by the Statute of the 18 of Ed. 3. and have sworn
<Q>to deny no Man common Right, by the King's Letters, nor none other Man's, nor for none other Cause, but to proceed to execute the Law notwithstanding the same Letters.</Q></P>
<P>Upon the whole therefore, I cannot avoid complaining of these Let∣ters, as an unwarrantable Abuse of the King's Name, and his Judges— He that sued them out did it at his Peril, and ought to answer the Contempt.—They are not only against Law, but couched in Term<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very disrespectful: We are commanded to obey at our Peril; and as an Outrage upon all the Rules of Decorum, one Part of the abject Duty injoined upon us is, to notify the Plantiff, <HI>Forsey,</HI> even of the Indignity offered us.</P>
<P>I have only to add, that as the Power of administring Justice, is one of the most important of all Powers, it ought not to be assumed with∣out the clearest Authority—None of your Predecessors ever heard an Appeal from the Verdict of a Jury—My long Residence in the Colony, and Seat on the Bench, and at the Board of Council, have given me Opportunities for some considerable Experience; and I know of no
<PB N="14" REF="041438_0018_101A88E84CF707E0"/>
Attempt 'till this, to bring such an Appeal: And from the Refusal of Counsel to support the Defendant's Application, you may naturally con∣clude, that the whole Body of the Law consider it as illegal —Whether a single Word in the Royal Instructions will warrant your assuming this great and important Power, I submit to your own Deliberations; not doubting but that many Objections will arise in your own Minds, which have been omitted by me, and might have been suggested by my Bro∣ther Justices, who are now unfortunately all out of Town.</P>

<P>A Letter from Mr. Justice <HI>Jones</HI> was read, informing his Honour the Lieutenant Governor, and the Gentlemen of the Council, that the Writs referred to in the Order, by which he is desired to give the Reasons of his Conduct, had not been delivered to him, nor had he seen any such in the Hands of any other Person; and therefore, that it is impossible for any Man to give the Reasons of his Conduct, in a Matter that never fell under his Consideration: Where∣upon it is the Opinion of this Court, that Mr. Justice <HI>Jones</HI> be desired, and he is hereby desired to give his Reasons to this Court, on <HI>Wednesday</HI> the 26th Instant, why the Appeal moved for in this Cause, in the Court below, was not allowed; or whether according to the Laws and Consti∣tution of <HI>England,</HI> an Appeal from the Verdict of the Jury, on the whole Merits of this Cause, could lie?

<P><HI>Whereupon he spoke to the Effect following;</HI></P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>THAT having been out of Town, on the 19th of <HI>November</HI> last, he had had no other Notice of the Request in Council, than by perusing a Copy of the Minute of that Day, attested by the Clerk; but being by his Seat in Council, obliged to assist in Government when called; and by his Office as Justice, to be of Council for the King, and accountable for his Conduct in the Supreme Court; he was willing, without any Delay, to Answer any Question that might reasonably and lawfully be proposed to him. To this End, finding the Question as connected with the preceding Matter so general, that were he to give his Answer in Terms as general as the Question, he conceived he should Disappoint the just and reasonable Expectation of this Honourable Court. Therefore, he had considered the Matter more at large, than would strictly suffice to answer that Question in the Terms proposed; and hoped he was able to Answer immediately, any particular Question upon the subject Matter then depending, relating to his Conduct in the Su∣preme Court.</P>

<P><PB N="18" REF="041438_0022_101A88F3F3176FF0"/>Upon which Commission, the said Justice observed, that as he was constituted a Justice of the Supreme Court, and that the Power and Authority granted to him, was to hear, try, and determine, according to the Laws, Statutes, and Customs, of that Part of the Kingdom of <HI>Great Britain</HI> called <HI>England</HI>; it was plainly a Law Commission, and that he was only authorized and empowered to award Executions of all Judg∣ments of the said Court, and to act and do, all Things which any of his Majesty's Justices of either Bench, or Barons of the Exchequer, in that Part of the Kingdom of <HI>Great Britain</HI> called <HI>England,</HI> might or ought to do; and to make such Rules and Orders in the said Court, as should be judged Convenient and Useful; and as near as might be, agreeable to the Rules and Orders of the Courts of King's Bench, Com∣mon Pleas, and Exchequer in <HI>England.</HI> But unless it did appear, that these Courts allowed Appeals from Verdicts taken in those Courts, which he was very sure they did not, he did not see it possible for the Judges of the Supreme Court of this Province to allow such an Appeal in that Court, without doing what their Commissions would not Warrant. And upon this Commission, limitting his Power to the Rules of the common Law, he grounded his first Reason, why he did not allow the Appeal from the Verdict, as prayed to be entered in the Supreme Court.</P>
<P>The said Justice also observed, as a second Reason for his Conduct, that formerly it had been practised, that the Justices of the Supreme Court, who had held their Offices by like Commission with his, had only been sworn as to their Oath of Office, by such general Words as these:</P>
<Q>Ye swear, that you will well and truly execute the Office of a Justice of the Supreme Court, according to the best of your Skill and Understand∣ing. <HI>So help you God.</HI></Q>
<P>But the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice <HI>Livingston,</HI> and himself, being desired to attend the Governor, to take the Oaths appointed by Law, and receive their Commissions, and being willing, (if they accepted those Commissions) not to want any legal Qualification, and to give all the Security to his Majesty and the People of this Province, which the Law required for the due Execution of the said Offices, informed Governor MONCKTON, who disliked that general Form, that there was a more extensive Oath proposed in the Books, and mentioned the Oath in the
<PB N="19" REF="041438_0023_101A88F5E8D76608"/>
18th of Ed. III. often referred to upon this Subject, which they pro∣duced, alledging, that it required some Explanation, and the concluding Words, which contained an <HI>Invocation</HI> (as used in the Church of <HI>Rome</HI>), <HI>of the help of all Saints,</HI> must be altered, because their Religion as Pro∣testants, and the Declaration enjoined by Law, declared such Invocation to be <HI>Superstitious and Idolatrous.</HI> The fixing and settling the Explana∣tion, and the said Alteration, took up three or four Days, and at length, it was taken with such Explanation, as had been given and agreed to, according to the Words in the Book, which are also entered upon Re∣cord, which the said Justice prayed might be read, which was Read ac∣cordingly, in the Words following, <HI>to wit:</HI></P>
<Q><HI>YE</HI> shall swear, that well and lawfully ye shall serve our LORD the King and his People, in the Office of Justice, and that law∣fully ye shall counsel the King in his Business, and that ye shall not Counsel nor assent to any Thing which may turn him in Damage or Disherison by any Manner, Way, or Colour, and that ye shall not know the Damage or Disherison of him, whereof ye shall not cause him to be warned by yourself, or by other; and that ye shall do equal Law and Execution of Right to all his Subjects, rich and poor, without having Regard to any Person; And that you take not by yourself, or by other, pri∣vily, nor apertly, Gift, nor Reward, of Gold nor Silver, nor of any other Thing which may turn to your Profit, unless it be Meat or Drink, and that of small Value, of any Man that shall have any Plea or Process hanging before you, as long as the same Process shall so be hanging, nor after, for the same Cause; and that ye take no Fee, as long as ye shall be Justice, nor Robes of any Man, great or small, but of the King himself; and that ye give none Advice, nor Counsel to no Man, great nor small, in no Case where the King is Party; And in Case that any of what Estate or Condition they be, come before you in your Sessions with Force and Arms, or otherwise, against the Peace, or against the Form of the Statute thereof made, to disturb Execution of the common Law, or to menace the People, that they may not pursue the Law, that ye shall cause their Bodies to be arrested and put in Prison; and in Case they be such that ye cannot arrest them, that ye certify the King of their Names, and of their Misprision hastily, so that he may thereof ordain a conve∣nable Remedy; And that ye by yourself, nor by other, privily nor apertly maintain any Plea or Quarrel hanging in the King's Court, or elsewhere in the Country, <HI>And that you deny to no Man common Right, by the
<PB N="20" REF="041438_0024_101A88F843E698A0"/>
King's Letters,</HI> nor none other Man's, nor for none other Cause, <HI>and in Case any Letters come to you contrary to the Law, that ye do nothing by such Letters,</HI> but certify the King thereof; and <HI>proceed to execute the Law—notwithstanding the same Letters;</HI> and that ye shall do and procure the Profit of the King and of his Crown, with all Things where ye may reasonably do the same; and in Case ye be from henceforth found in Default in any of the Points aforesaid, ye shall be at the King's Will, of Body, Lands and Goods, thereof to be done as shall please him.</Q>
<P>Upon which, it being observed by the Court, that the said Oath was very extensive and solemn, the said Justice said <HI>it is so,</HI> and that lest thro' Surprise or Forgetfulness he might deviate from it, he found it ne∣cessary frequently to read it, especially before the holding the Supreme Court, and on the Circuits; and observed, that as his Oath of Office, as well as his Commission, respected only the common Law and its Pro∣ceedings, and could not admit him, by any possible Construction, to decide or determine by any other Law; and as the common Law knew not of any such Appeal from a Verdict to any other Court than that wherein it was taken, he held himself obliged by his Oath, to refuse any Entry of the Appeal from the Verdict as offered, and that if he had al∣lowed that Appeal, he should have acted not only without Authority, but contrary to his Oath; for these Reasons, he could not allow the Appeal as offered, and which he hoped would appear to be a full An∣swer to this Question; adding therewith, if he had sat in a Court of Ad∣miralty, or any Court from whence Appeals are allowed to a superior Jurisdiction, he should doubtless upon Motion, have allowed them ac∣cording to the Law and Practice of such Courts.</P></Q>
<P>After which, the said Justice was desired to give the Reasons of his Conduct, with Regard to the Writs referred to in the Question proposed on the 19th of <HI>November</HI> last.</P>
<P><HI>To which he answered:</HI></P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>As to the first Writ directed to the Chief Justice, and other Judges of his Majesty's Supreme Court,
<Q>commanding them, and every of them, wholly to forbear Proceeding, or taking any Step further against the said <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> on the said Verdict, until the Cause and Merits thereof be heard before the Governor and Council, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="041438_0025_101A88FB38E78528"/>The said Justice acknowledged that he had been duly served with that Writ, and had compared the Copy thereof with the Original at the Time of Service; but as there had been no Application made to him in that said Cause, to do any Thing in Consequence of the said Verdict, since the Service of the said Writ, he had done nothing in it; but according to what he had heard, it was likely that the Validity or Legality of that Writ would come into Question in the Supreme Court; therefore, he was in their Honours Opinion, whether it would be proper that at pre∣sent he suspend his Judgment on that Point, as extrajudicial Opinions ought to be given very sparingly, and with great Caution, if at all, lest in Consequence of such Opinion, Suits should be promoted, Mainte∣nance encouraged, and the Judgment of the Justice himself forestalled, and the Public otherwise receive some Damage.</P>
<P>However, if the Court insisted upon his giving an Opinion on the Legality of that Writ, he was ready to give it: To which the Court agreed, that the Reason offered was sufficient, why any Opinion at pre∣sent on that Writ, should not be desired.</P></Q>
<P>And then as to the second Writ, reciting the former, and
<Q>Commanding the Chief Justice, and other the Judges of the Supreme Court, that they cause all and every the Proceedings against the said <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> whether by Bill, Plaint, or otherwise, whereon the said Verdict was obtained, to be brought before the Governor and Coun∣cil, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<Q>The said Justice declared, that he had not been served with that Writ, and had only a Copy of it delivered to him; but understood that the Writ had been delivered to the Chief Justice, to whom Returns on Writs of Error do properly belong; and as that Honourable Board had heard the Chief Justice's Reasons, why he did not make any Return of the Proceedings of the Supreme Court on that Writ, he also was in their Opinion, whether it was necessary for him to give his own Opinion concerning that Writ; but this <HI>also</HI> at present was not desired.</Q>
<DIV4 TYPE="document">
<P>Mr. Justice <HI>Livingston</HI> then delivered his Reasons in Writing, which were ordered to be entered, and are as follow:</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>BEING desired by your Honours, to give you the Reasons of my Conduct, in refusing to return two Instruments under Seal, di∣rected to the Chief Justice, and the other Judges of the Supreme Court;
<PB N="22" REF="041438_0026_101A88FCD3B0EC90"/>
by one of which, all Proceedings on a Verdict obtained by <HI>Thomas Forsey,</HI> against <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> are commanded to be stayed; and by the other, for the more fully enabling the Governor and Council to de∣termine the Matter of the said Verdict; we are further commanded, as we will answer the same at our Peril, to Cause all the Proceedings against the said <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> to be brought before the Governor and Council.</P>
<P>I beg Leave to observe, that my Conduct might easily be justified, by shewing that I had no Notice of those Letters, till the Chief Justice had refused to return them, after which no legal Return could be made, for a Writ must ever be returned by those to whom it is directed. But be∣cause I believe your Honours, in the Request you made us, did not in∣tend so much to call upon us for a Justification of our Conduct, as to receive the Opinion of the Judges in an Affair of the greatest Impor∣tance, and to be informed whether in our Explanation of the Instruction on which those Instruments seem to be founded, we agree with the Chief Justice; I shall with the greatest Willingness endeavour to answer your Expectations.—Had the Chief Justice in the least doubted in what Manner he ought to have acted on the Receipt of these Instruments, he would have waited till the Return of the other Judges out of the Coun∣try permitted a Consultation; but he thought, and it is by what I can learn the Opinion of every one of us, that the Case admitted no Dis∣pute.</P>
<P>For it is evident, that the Course of the Law, by which the Prero∣gatives of the Crown, and the Rights of the Subject, are defined and secured, must at all Times be free and uninterrupted; and this is so parti∣cularly provided for, that by the Oath we have taken, we are to deny no Man Right by the King's Letters, nor none other Man's, but to proceed notwithstanding such Letters. This was not intended however, to prevent the staying of Execution after Judgment, by Writs of Error; for the Correction of Errors is not a Delay, but a Furtherance of Justice.</P>
<P>The first Instrument appears to me, a very great Abuse of the King's Name and Authority. It commands us in Terms very dis∣respectful, and not such as are usual in Writs directed to us, wholly to forbear Proceeding or taking any further Step against the said <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> on the Verdict obtained against him. The Illegality of which will appear from these three Observations.</P></Q>
<P N="1"><PB N="23" REF="041438_0027_101A890082455C20"/>1st. It commands us not to do that, which the Law, our Duty, and common Justice to the Parties, oblige us to do; for had a Writ of Error been brought, we should have still been obliged to proceed to Judgment, and the signing of the Roll: And tho' it is allowable to bring Writs of Error before Judgment, this being the common Practice to prevent Execution, yet the Writ has no Effect till after Judgment; before that, the Party having received no Injury.</P>
<P N="2">2dly We are to forbear till the Merits of the Verdict are heard be∣fore y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Honours; but the Roll being with us, and no proper Method being taken to bring the Cause before you; this Prohibition might for any Thing which could appear to the Judges, have been perpetual, to the great Grievance of the Party concerned, and the Delay of Justice. Therefore the Chief Justice could not have refused to sign the Roll when it was required, notwithstanding this Prohibition.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Your Honours are incompetent Judges of the Merits of the Verdict, because it is impossible to inform you of the Grounds on which the Jury founded it, since they sometimes are guided by what they know of their own Knowledge; especially in what relates to the Characters of the Witnesses, of which they coming from the Neighbourhood, are the most proper Judges.</P>
<P><Q>The other Instrument, as well as the first, is directed "to our Chief Justice, and the other Judges of our Supreme Court, and to all the other Officers of our said Court, whom it may concern;</Q>
so that if we had made the Return required, we must have joined with all the Officers of the Court, or the Return would not have been good: Whe∣ther this be fit or decent, I leave to your Honour's Consideration.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>But waving the Defects of Form, of which there are many others, I shall observe on the Purport and Design of this Instrument, and shew that it was impossible for us to make such a Return as seems to be re∣quired. Previous to which, I shall make a few Observations on the Instruction on which it is founded.</P>
<P>The Intention of this Instruction appears to me no more than a Direction to your Honours, when you should suffer a Writ of Error to be brought, and when you are to dismiss the Cause. I have frequently read this Instruction on this Occasion, and it amazes me to find that any

Person should think it liable to a different Explanation. What gives Rise to the Construction on which these Instruments are founded, is the frequent Use of the Word <HI>Appeal</HI>; but how slender a Foundation this is, must appear from the Instructions before the Year 1753, quoted by his Honour the Chief Justice, which direct that you shall allow Appeals in Cases of Error from the Courts of Law; where the Word <HI>Appeal</HI> means nothing else but Writs of Error; and accordingly on all such Appeals, Writs of Error have been brought. — After this comes the Instruction in Question, and says, you shall allow Appeals from the Courts of common Law, only in some certain Cases, <HI>to wit,</HI> When the Value of the Thing appealed for exceeds the Sum of <HI>Three Hundred Pounds Sterling.</HI> What can this mean, but such an Appeal as was meant by the former Instruction? and in this Sense it seems to have been understood by your Honours; other∣wise you would not have suffered it to be made a Question, whether you ought to take Cognizance of a Cause brought before you by Writ of Error, when the only Objection was, that the Thing appealed for, did not amount to <HI>Three Hundred Pounds Sterling</HI>: An Instance of this Kind I was Witness to last <HI>Wednesday</HI>; for if the Instruction must be under∣stood to relate to Appeals in the civil Law Form, Writs of Error would have stood upon the same Footing they did before this Instruction was given. In this Explanation and Acceptation of the Word, your Honours are justified by the Use of it in common Parlance, and tho' this be not frequent among Lawyers, yet it is some times so used. Dr. <HI>Cowel</HI> in his <HI>Interpretor,</HI> on the Word <HI>Appeal,</HI> says it is used in the com∣mon, as in the civil Law, to signify the Removal of a Cause from an Inferior Judge to a Superior; and his Honour the Chief Justice has shewn you that it was so understood by the King in Council. — The Truth is, both in the civil and in the common Law, the Word is used in these two Senses, to signify an Accusation, and an Appeal from a Judgment, but as in the common Law, (which is more particular in it's Distinctions than any other) there are four Methods of Appeal from a Judgment, <HI>to wit,</HI> By Writ of Error, Writ of false Judgment, Writ of Attaint, and <HI>Audita querela,</HI> and as these have but little Similiarity with each other, so that the Law which regards the one, rarely affects the other, Lawyers have seldom Occasion to use the Word, which signi∣fies the Genus, but speak generally of one or other of the Species; and the Word <HI>Appeal</HI> is appropriated to signify a particular Accusation. But as it is very probable that this Instruction was not drawn by a Lawyer, and we know it was given for the Direction Gentlemen not much
<PB N="25" REF="041438_0029_101A8904EC8337C8"/>
versed in Law Terms; it is very probable that it is here used, in the common Acceptation of the Word, to signify any Removal of a Cause, from one Court to another; and this with more Propriety, as it may in∣tend to include two of the Species above mentioned, a Writ of Error, and a Writ of false Judgment; the latter of which is a Remedy against an erroneous Judgment, in a Court not of Record.</P>
<P>This being the plain Meaning, and certainly the most legal Expla∣nation of this Instruction, a Writ of Error should have been sent, and then your Honours would have had the Record before you: By the Instruction you are to send the usual Writ, and we as Judges dare not obey any other than such as are warranted by Law. All Others we must look upon as Letters contrived to delay or obstruct the Course of Justice.</P>
<P>But it may be asked, what Remedy shall the Party have, who is aggrieved by an unjust Verdict, or an Error in Fact.—To which the Answer is, he may have a Writ of Error, to try the Fact in the same Court; or he may have his Writ of Attaint, or according to the usual Practice, move the Court for a new Trial; or he may have his <HI>Audita querela</HI>: All which are competent Remedies according to the Nature of the Case, without carrying the Matter before another Judicatory: Be∣cause, the Judges are not concerned in any Errors in Fact, but such as may be made Part of the Record by a Bill of Exceptions, if the Party pleases, and consequently they still remain indifferent, and therefore an Appeal from their Judgment is unnecessary.</P>
<P>But what makes it evident, that the King did not intend by the above Instruction to alter the Law, and the Methods of Proceeding in the Supreme Court is this, The Instruction is not directed to the Judges of that Court, and therefore was not intended to regulate their Conduct: They must still determine and act according to Law, and nothing can be more absurd than to suppose, that they must have Recourse to a Go∣vernor's Instructions, to spell out their Duty from such Scraps of them as he shall think proper to communicate. Further, it is evident, that Writs of Error were only meant by this Instruction.</P></Q>
<P N="1">I. Because it directs the Governor to issue a Writ in the Manner which has been usually accustomed, and this is the usual Writ, and no other has been used.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="26" REF="041438_0030_101A890949096E48"/>II. This will bring up all that the Justices of the Supreme Court can send, and therefore any other Writ must be useless. Nothing else is in our Power at present, but the Record, and <HI>that</HI> we are ready to send as soon as it is properly demanded. In civil Law Courts, the Evidence is reduced to Writing, and therefore, upon an Appeal, may be trans∣mitted. But send to us as many Letters as you please, and let them contain Terms still more menacing than those sent us upon this Occasion, if the Law did not fully justify us in our Refusal to return them, our Excuse would be <HI>Nil dat, quod non habet.</HI> The Evidence went to the Jury, most of it was delivered <HI>viva voce,</HI> and it is impossible for us to retain it in our Memories: Should we make Records of all that was said by each Witness, in every Trial, the Labour would be endless, and the whole Year would not suffice for the Trial of the Causes which yearly arise, tho' the Court should sit every Day, and the Country be obliged to a perpetual Attendance.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>But as the Chief Justice has sufficiently shewn the Inconveniencies which must attend this new Practice; I shall not enlarge on them, tho' many others might be mentioned that would result from altering the Law, in so essential a Point as Trials by Juries.</P>
<P>I have as much as possible in giving your Honours these Reasons for my Conduct, avoided saying any Thing the Chief Justice has already observed; because I would not trespass on your Patience, by an unneces∣sary Repetition. But he has been so copious, and has treated the Matter so well, that I have not been able to avoid sliding into some of them.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, it appears to me a very unsafe Interpretation of this Instruction, to say, that his Majesty designed by it to establish such a Court, as has been altogether unknown to <HI>Englishmen,</HI> since the glo∣rious Revolution. That he intended (except in Causes thought too trifling to admit of an Appeal) to deprive his Subjects in this Colony of their indisputable Right to Trials by Juries, one of the most antient Privileges of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> confirmed to them by the great Charter, es∣sential to, and the grand <HI>Palladium</HI> of their Liberties.</P>
<P>Such a Supposition would be extremely injurious to his Majesty, and the Memory of his Royal Grandfather, in whose Time this Instruc∣tion was first given, especially as the Monarchs of the illustrious House of Hanover, could never be justly charged with taking a single Step towards infringing the Liberties of their People.</P></Q>

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P>I Have received from Mr. <HI>Banyar,</HI> the Copy of the Minute of Council, made at the Council held at <HI>Fort-George,</HI> in the City of <HI>New York,</HI> on Wednesday the 12th Instant; by which I am desired to give my Reasons, why the Appeal moved for in the Cause of <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> against <HI>Thomas Forsey,</HI> in the Court below, was not al∣lowed; or whether according to the Laws and Constitution of <HI>England,</HI> an Appeal from the Verdict of the Jury, on the whole Merits of this Cause, could lie? In answer to the first Part, I have only to acquaint your Honour, and the Gentlemen of the Council, that I happened not to be in Court, the last Day of the Term, when the Appeal was moved for: As to the Second, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether according to the Laws and Con∣stitution of <HI>England,</HI> an Appeal from the Verdict of the Jury, on the whole Merits of this Cause, could lie?—In Answer to this Question, I must declare to your Honour, and the Gentlemen of the Council, that
<PB N="28" REF="041438_0032_101A890D349618E0"/>
in all my reading, on the Laws and Constitution of <HI>England,</HI> I cannot recollect that I have ever met with any Thing in Favour of such an Ap∣peal. On the Contrary, the known Rule is, <HI>ad Quaestionem Juris res∣pondent Judices, ad Quaestionem Facti respondent Juratores.</HI> The Book intitled <HI>The Law of Errors,</HI> P. 4, says, it is a known Rule in our Books,
<Q>a Judgment being once given in <HI>Curia Domini Regis,</HI> ought not to be reversed, nor avoided but by Error, or Attaint, for all Matters of Fact at common Law, are decided by a Jury of Twelve Men, against whom if they err in their Judgment, the Party grieved may bring Attaint.</Q>
The Writ of Attaint lay originally at com∣mon Law, and is affirmed with some Alterations by the Statute of the 23d of HENRY the Eighth, C. the 3d; and in <HI>Wood</HI>'s Institute of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> P. 637, is thus described;
<Q>A Writ of Attaint lies against a Jury, and is to examine whether a Jury of twelve Men gave a false Verdict, or contrary to Evidence, in a Court of Record upon Issue joined: That upon Conviction of the Jury, the Judgment following upon it may be reversed.</Q>
This appears to me to be the only Method formerly used to set aside or avoid the Verdict of a Jury; but as <HI>Wood</HI> says, in the same Place, is now almost out of Use; and in∣stead thereof, Motions are usually made for new Trials when a Verdict is given contrary to Evidence; which seems to be the present Practice in the Courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and is the Practice of the Supreme Court here: In removing a Cause from one Court to another for Matter of Error, the common Method I take to be by Writ of Error, tho' sometimes by <HI>Certiorari,</HI> and the Proceedings on such Writs, are in Relation to the Errors of the Judges, in Matters of Law; and are not to have Respect to the Verdict of the Jury, as appears to me from the Statute of the 27th of ELIZABETH, C. 8th, how erroneous Judgments in the King's Bench, upon certain personal Actions may be redressed; where Verdicts are expressly excepted· — I therefore give it as my Opi∣nion, that according to the Laws and Constitution of <HI>England,</HI> the Ap∣peal mentioned in the Question could not lie.</P>

<P>HIS Honour the Lieutenant Governor required the Opinion of the Council on the following Question.</P>
<P><Q>Whether by the 32d Instruction, the King has directed his Gover∣nor to permit and allow Appeals in all civil Causes, from the Courts
<PB N="30" REF="041438_0034_101A8913745B9C38"/>
of common Law within this Province; and whether his Majesty has by the same Instruction, directed his Governor and Council to hear and determine such Appeals?</Q></P>
<P>Whereupon the Council declared, that as the King's Judges, and the most able Council in the Law in the Province, have given their Opinion, that no other than an Appeal on <HI>Error,</HI> can lie by this Instruction; they are unanimously of Opinion, no other Appeal than on <HI>Error,</HI> is the Intention or Meaning of the Crown by this Instruction, and that they cannot take Cognizance of any other Appeal.</P>
<P>His Honour the Lieutenant Governor declared his Dissent from the said Opinion, and signified he would give his Reasons for such his Dissent to his Majesty's Ministers.</P>
<P>Whereupon a Motion was made, that the Reasons offered by the Council in this Cause, on Wednesday last, should be entered, which were ordered to be entered accordingly, and are in the Words following:</P>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="minutes">
<HEAD><HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> Claiming to be Appellant against <HI>Thomas Forsey.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HIS Majesty's Council for the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> as constituting with the Go∣vernor or Commander in Chief for the Time being, the Court established by his Majesty's royal Predecessors, and referred to in his present Majesty's 32d Instruction; conceiving it to be a Question of the utmost Importance, whether by Virtue of that, or any precedent royal Instruction, they are authorized in Conjunction with his Honour the Lieutenant Governor, to hold Cog∣nizance of this Cause, on an Appeal upon the Merits, from the Verdict of a Jury?</P>
<P>On this momentous Topic, the Lieutenant Governor, and the Coun∣cil, have taken the utmost Pains to form a Judgment, by which Justice may be distributed to the Subject, consistent with the known and esta∣blished Laws of the Land, and the true Sense and Meaning of the royal Instructions.</P>
<P>In this Veiw, as it is a Case of the first Impression, the Court unani∣mously called upon the Judges of the Supreme Court, and several Coun∣sel of the best Reputation in their Profession, who have all concurred in Opinion, that we are not authorized either by Law or by any of the
<PB N="31" REF="041438_0035_101A8915E9901B30"/>
royal Instructions, in several Instances so evidently grounded on the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> to hold jurisdiction of this Cause, as it is now brought be∣fore us. The Court has besides those Aids, given every Advantage to a Point of so great Moment, which the most mature Consideration could afford: And that it may appear upon what Reasons his Majesty's Coun∣cil have the Unhappiness to differ in Opinion from his Honour the Lieu∣tenant Governor, they beg Leave to consider the Reasons urged by him in Favour of the Appeal, as it is now brought before us; and to subjoin such Answers to those Reasons, as it is conceived the Law will warrant.</P>
<P>His Majesty's Council humbly hope, that they cannot better Recom∣mend themselves to his royal Approbation, than by making the Law of the Land the Rule of their Conduct, in the Execution of every Part of the important Trust committed to them; and flatter themselves, that their Dissention in Sentiment from his Honour, as it is founded on the clearest Law, will be a full Demonstration of their Fidelity to the best of Princes.</P>
<P>In this material Division in the Sentiments of this Court; his Ma∣jesty's Council are of Opinion, that his Honour's Reasons will, if lite∣rally incorporated into this their Answer, appear in a View, the most advantageous of which they are capable: And as we with the utmost Willingness submit the Reasons of our Judgment to the Consideration of those, who by Law are invested with a Power to correct our Errors, and controul our Determinations, we flatter ourselves that his Honour would not decline the same Tribunal; and as we presume the Law must at last determine upon this Difference, so also we conceive that such Determination can best be made upon a fair State of the Contrast.</P>
<P>In the Pursuit of this Method, his Honour's Reasons will be reduced into as many different Paragraphs, as their Subject Matter naturally dictates; to each of which his Majesty's Council will offer such An∣swers, as their Duty to their Prince, and the Laws of the Land clearly and undeniably suggest. The first Paragraph is as follows:</P>
<Q>An Error I conceive runs thro' all the Arguments I have heard on this Subject, in not distinguishing between the Laws and the Execution of them: The executory judicial Powers are certainly in the Crown: The King is the Fountain of Justice: The Power of erecting Courts of Justice is consequently in the Crown. The King may give them
<PB N="32" REF="041438_0036_101A891954C01688"/>
such Modes of Proceeding, such Extent of Authority and Jurisdiction, as he thinks most proper for obtaining Justice, in the Countries where such Courts are erected, suited to the Circumstance of the Country; and it may be done without the least Alteration of the Law, by which such Courts must Judge. This is evident in our Colonies; every Colony has different Courts and Modes of Proceeding from those in other Colonies; and all of them different from the Courts in <HI>England</HI>; yet the same common Law has its full Force in all of them.</Q>
<P><HI>In Answer to this we observe:</HI></P>
<P>That we think the Distinction which his Honour supposes between the Laws and the Execution of them, in the Sense urged in his Rersons, is groundless. For tho' we agree with him, that the Law must essenti∣ally and unalterably be the same, unless changed by legislative Act, (which the Distinction taken by him necessarily supposes) and that judi∣cial Powers are in Supposition of Law in the Crown, that the King is the Fountain of Justice, and the Power of erecting Courts is in the Crown: Yet we beg Leave to deny his Inference, that the King may give them such Modes of Proceeding, such Extent of Authority and Jurisdiction as he thinks proper, as well as that such Modes may be introduced as have hitherto been unknown, without the least Alteration of the Law, by which such Court must Judge.</P>
<P>For, 1st, we conceive that tho' the Crown has Authority to erect and constitute Courts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>6</HI> Rep. <HI>11.</HI>—Wood's Inst. <HI>447.</HI> Vin. tit. Prerogative, P. <HI>561,</HI> No. <HI>8.</HI></NOTE> yet every Court must have such a Jurisdiction, and must be so modelled in its essential Parts, as to have a known and common Law Juris∣diction.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Wherever such new modelled Courts are essentially different from those known in the Law, the Law must necessarily and of Course be altered; as the Maxim wisely speaks, <HI>Mutata Forma prope intere∣mitur Substantia rei</HI>; for Instance, were the Lieutenant Governor's Sup∣position just, that his Majesty's 32d Instruction did intend that this Court as a Court of Appeals, should have Cognizance of Matters of Fact, already settled and determined by a Jury, it would alter the Law in the grand and essential Point of Trials by Juries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Law Er. <HI>4.</HI>—Cro. Ja. <HI>335, 336</HI>—Trials per pais, <HI>6</HI>th Ed. <HI>227, 228.</HI> Vaug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣an <HI>148, 149.</HI></NOTE> whose Verdicts by the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> are the only Means by which Facts can be determined, and would amount to a Reversal of the common Law

Maxim, <HI>ad Quaestionem Juris respondet Judices, ad Quaestionem Facti re∣spondent Juratores.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. Tho' different Methods of Proceeding in the different Colo∣nies, are rather assumed by them than warranted by Law, and yet the principal Difference between them is perhaps in Matters of Form, (in which all the various Courts of Law in <HI>England</HI> do also differ); but the essential Parts of every common Law Court, <HI>to wit,</HI> a Jury to determine the Facts, and Judges to speak the Law, are to be found, in all the Courts of Law of every Colony.</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>His Honour in the next Paragraph observes, that <Q>In all the Colonies Appeals to the King lie — this is essential to the Preroga∣tive of the Crown, without which the Dependence of the Colonies cannot be preserved. The preserving the Dependence of all the Dominions of the Crown, the Parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> evidently had in View, in the Act of the 6th of GEORGE the 1st. <HI>for the bet∣ter securing the Dependency of Ireland</HI>; but as this Matter is of great Importance, I shall consider it more distinctly.</Q></P></Q>
<P>His Majesty's Council observe on this Paragraph, that the Word Appeal is used without settling its Definition: If by it is intended an Appeal upon Matters of Fact, they cannot help observing it is a <HI>Petitio Principii.</HI> That in all the Colonies an Appeal in the confined Sense of the Word (and in the only proper Sense in which it is known in the Law of <HI>England, to wit,</HI> from the Judgment of the Judges in Matters of Law, will lie to the King as present in Supposion of Law) in all his Courts, cannot be doubted. And in this Sense an Appeal is clearly both essential to the Prerogative of the Crown, and absolutely necessary for maintaining the Dependence of the Colonies, as the inferior upon <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as the Superior Dominion; and these indeed are the only Reasons why an Appeal in any Sense of the Word will lie. For thus the greatest Lawyers reason on the Subject.</P>
<P>As such Dominions are not Parcel of, but Dominions dependent on <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> no remedial Writs between Subject and Subject will lie, from the superior to the inferior Dominion; as they do from the Courts of <HI>Westminster</HI> to any of the Counties of <HI>England,</HI> except Writs of Error. But if the Errors of Judges in the dependent Dominion might not be corrected by some Judicatory in the Kingdom on which it de∣pends, these Consequences would follow, <HI>to wit.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="34" REF="041438_0038_101A891D7AF69AC0"/>1st. That the Law appointed or permitted to such inferior Dominion, might be insensibly changed within itself, without the Assent of the Do∣minion superior.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That Judgments might be then given to the Disadvantage or lessening of the Superiority; which cannot be reasonable: and to make the Superiority to be only of the King, but not of the Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> as King <HI>James</HI> once would have it in a Case concerning <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore it necessarily follows, that Writs of Error into all Domini∣ons belonging to <HI>Great Britain,</HI> upon the ultimate Judgments there given into the King's Courts of <HI>England,</HI> to reverse or affirm Judgments, are necessary to support a Dependence,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vaughan's Repo.</HI> 401.402.</NOTE> and are the only Writs that lie concerning Property between Subject and Subject.</P>
<P>But that Appeals upon Matters of Fact, are not necessary to support the Dependence in Question, is obvious at first View, for whether a Question of Fact be determined between Subject and Subject, either in the Affirmative or Negative, cannot possibly affect such Dependence.</P>
<P>As to the Statute for securing the Dependence of <HI>Ireland,</HI> we cannot conceive how his Honour should think of applying it to the present Case; for,</P>
<P N="1">1st. It contains not a single Word in Relation to the Colonies, and therefore we cannot see the Propriety of the Assertion, that in the passing of that Act, the Parliament of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> had in View the preserving the Dependence of <HI>all</HI> the Dominions of the Crown.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That Act as far as it provides for securing the Dependence of <HI>Ireland,</HI> directs nothing more than that the House of Lords in <HI>Ireland</HI> shall not have any Jurisdiction to judge, affirm or reverse, any Judgment, Sentence, or Decree, made or given there, or in other Words, that they were not a Court of Appeals, either in Law or Equity. The Statute therefore cannot be understood to have intended a Change or Alteration in the Law, by giving the Subject in <HI>Ireland</HI> a Right of appealing from the Verdict of a Jury. In the next Paragraph his Honour observes, that,</P>
<P><Q>By the Word Appeal in Law is meant the removing the Cause from an inferior to a superior Judicatory: By Writ of Error the Cause is
<PB N="35" REF="041438_0039_101A891F1D396E18"/>
not removed, but some disputed Points in Law are determined, and which may have no Relation to the Merits of the Cause. — Appeals to the King in Person were by the common Law, both before and after the Conquest, and are confirmed by <HI>Magna Charta, nulli vendemus, nulli negabimus, nec deferemus Justitiam,</HI> relates especially to Appeals, in which the King was Judge; for to sell, deny, or de∣lay Justice, can have no reference to any Person, other than a Judge: The Complaint was, that large Sums of Money were demanded for Writs of Appeal, and at other Times they were denied or delayed. To remedy these Complaints, this Clause was made Part of the great Charter; thereby the Subject's Right to Appeals is confirmed, not taken away.</Q></P>
<P>We agree with the Lieutenant Governor, that by an Appeal in Law, is meant the Removal of a Cause from an inferior to a superior Judica∣tory.</P>
<P>But in Opposition to his Opinion, we beg Leave to shew in a few Words, that by Writ of Error the Cause and its Merits are removed, for the Record itself which contains the whole Pleadings between the Par∣ties, the Issue, the Verdict, and the Judgment is removed; and the Er∣rors essential in the Law in either Part of the Record are corrected, and the Judgment in the Whole is either reversed or affirmed.—Thus then the Merits in Law arising from the Matters of Fact, contained in the Record, must necessarily receive their Determination in a Court of Er∣rors; nor can it justly be supposed, that constitutional Courts have been erected with Power to lay their Hands on the Proceedings in a Cause only to furnish an Opportunity for handling some disputed Points in Law, which have no Relation to the Merits of the Cause: Every Error therefore, which is corrigible by Law, must, in Supposition of Law, be essential to the Merits of the Cause; otherwise Writs of Error, instead of being constitutional Remedies, would necessarily and essentially con∣travene those Words of the great Charter <HI>nulli negabimus, nulli differe∣mus Justitiam vel Rectum.</HI> Thus then we conceive, that the Distinction set up by his Honour between Appeals and Writs of Error, is ground∣less; and that a Writ of Error is an Appeal upon the Merits in Law;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salk. <HI>511.</HI> Comb. <HI>276.</HI>—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord Ray, <HI>1447.</HI>—Hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> History com.

<P>But as his Honour has been pleased in this Paragraph to furnish a Comment on the Chapter of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> a Passage from which we
<PB N="36" REF="041438_0040_101A89225D7E1068"/>
have mentioned, we must take the Liberty to oppose it with another Comment on the same Words, given by the great Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> which clearly shews, 1st. That this Chapter cannot concern the King's Perso∣nal Administration of Justice on Appeals upon Matter of Fact, but the Administration of Justice by his known and ordinary Courts; in all which, the King, tho' not in Fact, yet in Supposition of Law is present, which is the Reason that the King himself, in the Words of the Charter, declares, he will not do what he intends his Court shall not;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Inst.</HI> 46.</NOTE>
<Q>And thus speaks the great Oracle of the Law; no Man shall be condemned at the King's Suit, either before the King in his Bench, where the Pleas are <HI>Coram Rege,</HI> (and so are the Words, <HI>nec super eum ibimus</HI> to be understood) nor before any other Commissioner or Judge whatsoever; and so are the Words, <HI>nec super eum mittemus</HI> to be understood, but by the Judgment of his Peers, that is his Equals, and according to the Law of the Land;</Q>
and from this Paraphrase the Author says, the Sense of the other Clause; <HI>we will deny, sell, or refuse Justice to no Man,</HI> is distinctly understood: And upon the same Clause he further observes thus;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> 55.</NOTE>
<Q>This is spoken in the Person of the King, who in Judgment of Law in all his Courts is present, and repeating these Words, <HI>Nulli vendemus,</HI> &amp;c.</Q>
Or,</P>
<P N="2">2dly. These Words as they have been expounded by other Acts of Parliament intend that,
<Q>by no Means common Right or common Law should be disturbed or delayed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ib.</HI> 56:</NOTE> not though it be commanded under the great Seal (as in the present Case) or by privy Seal, Order, Writ, Letters, Message, or Commandment what∣soever, either from the King or any other; and that the Justices shall proceed (as in this Case they have done) as if no such Writs, Letters, Order, Message, or other Commandment were come to them.</Q></P>
<P>And thus it appears clearly from the best Comment on the Subject, that his Honour in applying this Chapter of <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> to the sup∣posed Appeal, in which the King was the Judge, has misunderstood the Text: We are therefore at a Loss to discover from whence his Honour has collected the Reason upon which he alledges this Chapter of the great Charter was grounded, (to wit) <HI>That large Sums of Money were de∣manded for Writs of Appeal; and at other Times, they were denied or delayed, or that this Clause was made Part of the great Charter, to con∣firm the Subject's Right to Appeals.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="041438_0041_101A8925634747D0"/>Before we proceed to a particular Consideration of the rest of his Honour's Reasons, it will be necessary to extract and refute a latent Distinction which implicitly runs thro' most of them: It is this, That tho' the Colonies are intitled to the Antient common Law of <HI>England,</HI> as it stood before the Time of the great Charter, yet none of the Laws which took Place since that important Aera, do extend to the Colonies.</P>
<P><HI>This Distinction we conceive may be refuted by observing:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1st. That it has been solemnly adjudged before the King in Council, that in all Colonies the Subjects carry with them the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and therefore as well those that took Place after,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Salk.</HI> 411. 2 <HI>Mod.</HI> 47.</NOTE> as those which were in Force before the passing of the great Char∣ter.—2 Peer W.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That by the Statute of 7 &amp; 8, W. III. the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> as they then were, and as they should appear to be thereafter, are made the Standards of Law in the Colonies; as,</P>
<P N="3">3dly. They are also by one of his present Majesty's Instructions, in which the Gov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>or or Commander in Chief is directed
<Q>to take Care that no Man's Life, Members, Freehold, or Goods, be taken away or harmed, otherwise than by established and known Laws, not repugnant to, but as much as may be, agreeable to the Laws of England,</Q>
pursuant to which Adjudication, Statute, and Instruction,</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The Laws of <HI>England</HI> in themselves, and in the Manner of administering them, have been the Measure of Right and Wrong between Subject and Subject in this Colony, from its first Settlement, down to the present Day; and will doubtless be maintained as such, agreeable to the Coronation Oath established by the Statute of the 1 W. and M. Statute 1, Chap. 6, Sec. 2. according to which, the King swears to govern the People of <HI>England, and the Dominions thereunto belonging</HI> according to the Statutes in Parliament agreed on, and the Laws and Customs of the same.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding which, the Lieutenant Governor evidently proceeds upon the abovementioned Distinction, in his next Paragraph, which is in these Words:</P>
<P><Q>At the Time of the great Charter, all the Property of the Nation was determined in the Hundred Court, County, or Sheriff's Court,
<PB N="38" REF="041438_0042_101A89287927FD10"/>
and Baron's Court; and if the Party could not obtain Justice in those Courts, he might appeal to the King, who would do him Jus∣tice—To do Justice was also Part of the antient Coronation Oath.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Upon which we observe:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1st. That if by the Law of <HI>England</HI> no such Appeal as he maintains did lie in <HI>England,</HI> at the Time of the Settlement of this Colony, it could not for the Reasons we have assigned ever lie here. —</P>
<P N="2">2dly. We must take the Liberty to observe, that the Lieutenant Governor when he asserted, that at the Time of the great Charter, all the Property of the Nation was determined in the Hundred Counts, &amp;c. must have forgot the great Courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and the Justices in Eyre, for to suppose that the Courts at <HI>Westminster</HI> and in Eyre, were then in Being, and without Employment, is really difficult; that how∣ever, the King's Bench and common Pleas existed before the great Charter, appears from 11 Chapter of the Charter itself, which runs thus, <HI>Communia Placita non sequuntur Curiam nostram sed tenentur in aliquo certo Loco</HI>: The same Point is manifested by the next Chapter, which runs thus, <HI>Justitiarii de Banco,</HI> that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2</HI> Inst. page <HI>21.</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> the Justices of the Court of common Pleas are expressly named: as also by my Lord <HI>Coke</HI>'s Comments upon those Chapters. And with Respect to all the four great Courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">10 <HI>Ed.</HI> 4 <HI>fo.</HI> 53 8 <HI>Rep. pref.</HI> 16</NOTE> it was adjudged so early as in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> IV. that they were all by the common Law. In the Time of <HI>R.</HI> I. Pleas of Land were indifferently held in the King's Bench and common Pleas;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hales history of com. law, <HI>146.</HI></NOTE> and tho' in the Reign of his Father, King <HI>H.</HI> II. the Administration of common Justice had by the Practice of the Subject, who was apt to seek Justice nearer Home than in the Courts of <HI>Westminster,</HI> been almost wholly drawn to the County Courts, Hundred Courts, and Courts Baron; yet Justices in Eyre were in that Prince's Reign appointed by Act of Parliament, who were <HI>Missi per singulos Angliae Comitatus, &amp; juraverunt quod cuilibet Jus suum conservarent illaesum.</HI></P>
<P>And that the Kings of <HI>England</HI> never did since the Aera, that is often Times, tho' unjustly called the <HI>Norman</HI> Conquest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 73.</NOTE> administer Justice in Person, is evident from a Passage in the antient Book, called the Mirror of Justice, which contains the Law as it stood
<Q>above 1200 Years ago, and has in it a Passage in old <HI>French,</HI> which translated runs thus: the Kings used to do right in Person to
<PB N="39" REF="041438_0043_101A892B8561EA18"/>
all the Subjects, or by their Chief Justices, but now they Decree Jus∣tice by their Justices Errant Commissioned for all Pleas;</Q>
and my Lord <HI>Coke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mir. Chap. <HI>2, § <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> in extracting the Sub∣stance of this antient Author in his Preface to his 3d Rep. says, in this
<Q>Book in Effect appeareth the whole Frame of the antient common Law of this Realm;</Q>
and then proceeds to Instance the Truth of this Observation, by exhibiting from the <HI>Mirror</HI> a Sketch of the Au∣thority of all the common Law Courts; among which are the Four great Courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> and particularly the Court of King's Bench, of which he speaks thus;
<Q>The King's Bench, Chief Justices holding Pleas of the King, and soon after the Office of Chief Justice be∣longed to redress, and punish by Writ, the wrongful Judgments, Wrongs and Errors of other Justices, and to Cause to come before the King, the Parties and the Record, &amp;c. that is before the King, because he always sat in Person in his Bench; tho' the Judges rendered the Judgments:</Q>
And from this Passage it appears to a Demonstra∣tion, that the King's Bench before the Conquest, enjoyed the Power of correcting by Writ, that is by Writ of Error, the wrongful Judg∣ments and Errors of all other Courts; which in truth appear to be the only Appeal, (except in criminal Matters, where the Word is used in a different Sense) that was ever known in the Law.</P>
<P>In the Reign of King <HI>John,</HI> the Business of the inferior Courts gra∣dually diminished, and the Business of Moment came to the great Courts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hales Hist. Com. Law, <HI>15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> these gave a ready Far to Writs of false Judgment, <HI>which was the Appeal the Law allowed from erroneous Judgments in the County, and other inferior Courts</HI>; and by these Writs, a Variety of which may be found in the Register, nothing but the Record of the Cause which was made for the Purpose, was sent up: And these must be the Appeals alluded to by his Honour; which however appear to be in the Nature of Writs of Error; and were used to bring up the Judgments of the inferior Courts into the Courts at <HI>Westminster</HI>; where the Errors in Law, in the Judgments of those lower Judicatories were corrected by the King's Judges, and not by the King himself.—</P>
<P>But it may not be amiss to take Notice here, of what the Lieutenant Governor says on the Subject of the Court of Hustings, or the Mayor's Court of <HI>London.</HI>—
<Q>In the Mayor and Sheriff's Court, commonly
<PB N="40" REF="041438_0044_101A892DC1640C70"/>
called the Hustings, where all the Property of the Citizens is deter∣mined, a Writ of Error does not lie, but an Appeal: In Conse∣quence of which, the King appoints Commissioners, who are <HI>to do full and speedy Justice.</HI> They do not only reverse, or affirm the Judgment of the Hustings, but they give such Judgment as the Hustings ought to have given. The Jurisdiction of the Hustings is by common Law; and Writs of Error do not lie in any Court whose Jurisdiction is by common Law, but an Appeal does.</Q></P>
<P>Upon which we observe, that the Lieutenant Governor is again mis∣taken in supposing that an Appeal lies from the Hustings to Commis∣sioners in Matters of Fact, and that those Commissioners do full and speedy Justice upon the whole Merits, both in Fact and Law. On the Contrary, it will appear from the Perusal of the Books on the Subject, that they act merely as a Court of Errors, in either reversing, or affir∣ming the Judgment of the Hustings.<NOTE PLACE="marg">New. Nat. Brev. <HI>53.</HI> H.</NOTE> <HI>Fitzherbert</HI> asserts,
<Q>that if an erroneous Judgment be given in the Courts before the Sheriff of <HI>London only,</HI> the Party grieved shall have a Writ of Error out of Chancery, directed unto the Sheriffs, to bring the Record before the Mayor and Aldermen, in the Hus∣tings of <HI>London</HI>; and there the Record shall be examined; and if there be Error, they shall reverse the Record there, by the Custom of the said City: And if erroneous Judgment be given in the Hustings in <HI>London,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Idem.</HI> 55 <HI>E.</HI> 4 <HI>Inst.</HI> 247.248.</NOTE> before the <HI>Mayor and the Sheriffs</HI> there, then the Party who will sue to reverse the Judgment, shall come into the Chancery, and there sue a Commission," directed to Persons to examine the Record and Process, and the Errors, and thereupon to do Right.<NOTE PLACE="marg">New. Nat. Brev. <HI>55.</HI> G.</NOTE> And a Man shall have a Com∣mission to examine the Errors in a Judgment given in the Hustings in the Time of another King, and in the Time of another Mayor, and other Sheriffs.</Q>
And in the same Chapter, the Author speaks repeatedly of suing Writs of Error, and Commissions to remove the Judgments of the Mayor and Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> and of correcting the Errors of their Judgments. And from the several Forms of Writs and Commissions of Error to the Hustings, contained in that Chapter, it appears clearly that they are essentially and substantially the same as Writs of Error in other Cases, and to other Courts. And we suppose that the Lieutenant Governor's Mistake on this Subject, proceeded from the Use of the Word Commission, instead of Writ, tho' in Fact and Truth, every Writ of Error is more properly a Com∣mission than a Writ.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Law of Errors <HI>2</HI> and <HI>3.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="041438_0045_101A893083E1E198"/>
<HI>His Honour in the Sixth Paragraph observes, that,</HI></P>
<Q>From the Nature of the Courts, which existed by common Law, it is evident, that the Distinction now in Use, between Writs of Error and Appeals, could not then exist; because there was no such Distinction then, between the Jury and the Judges, as now in the Courts of <HI>Westminster.</HI> By common Law the Jury was absolutely Judge of both Law and Fact. This is still evident in the Sheriff's Court, Coroner's Court, and in the House of Peers: Appeals must extend to the whole Merits, where there was no Distinction between the Verdict of the Jury, and the Judgment of the Court, as it is evident by common Law there is not.</Q>
<P><HI>Upon which his Majesty's Council Remark, that,</HI></P>
<P>Proofs are not wanting in the Books to shew that Juries were in Use, even among the antient <HI>Britons</HI>; that as Juries now do, so did they of all Times try the Matters of Fact; that as they r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w are in some Sense Judges of Law, where they take upon themselves to find general Verdicts, so were they antiently; and by the antient common Law they were no more Judges of Fact solely, than they now are: The Evidence formerly was never reduced to Writing any more than it now is, <HI>to wit,</HI> on Demurrers and special Verdicts; in which the Law was always reserved for the Determination of the Court; and the Maxim, <HI>ad Quaestionem Juris respondent Judices, ad Quaestionem Facti respondent Juratores,</HI> is an antient common Law Maxim: To suppose therefore that there is now a Distinction between Appeals and Writs of Error, which did not antiently exist, appears to us altogether groundless; the Truth is, no such Distinction now does, or ever did exist. Nor do we conceive, that the Instances adduced from this Sheriff's Court, Coroner's Court, and House of Peers, are at all pertinent: In the two first, Facts are settled in the same Manner as they are in the Courts of <HI>Westminster, to wit,</HI> by a Jury; and in the House of Peers, nothing but Matters of Law, except where the Appeal is from the Equity Side of the Chancery, or Exchequer, in which the Proceedings by the Law of the Land are to be in the <HI>Pretorian</HI> Method, and the Evidence reduced to Writing, are ever determined there; it being below their Dignity to try Matters of Fact.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Salk.</HI> 511.</NOTE></P>
<P>His Majesty's Council conceive, that his Honour is mistaken in his Opinion, that Writs of Error were introduced into the Courts of <HI>West∣minster, long after the great Charter.</HI> The Paragraph in which this is contained runs thus:</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="041438_0046_101A89337B5865E8"/><Q>Writs of Error I have Reason to believe were introduced into the Courts of <HI>Westminster,</HI> long after the Time of the Great Charter— Courts are known to assume Powers, which did not originally belong to them. —Judge <HI>Coke</HI> says, <HI>boni Judicis est amp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iure Jurisdictionem.</HI> If these assumed Powers are found beneficial, they become confirmed by Usage; such are Writs of Error: But as they are not by common Law, they are confined to the Courts, where such Usage prevails. For this Reason, and their being useful they were extended by Acts of Parliament to other Courts and Places, where such Usage did not prevail.—The Necessity of an Act of Parliament, sufficiently shews, that they are not by common Law: This is made more evident by what I think is universally agreed, with Respect to the Islands of <HI>Jersey</HI> and <HI>Guernsey,</HI> where Judicial Trials are by Jury; that in Case any Party is aggrieved by any Sentence, or Judgment, there he is to have his Remedy by Appeal, to the King in his Privy Council; and that Judgments are not to be examined by Writs of Error. The Reason given is, <HI>that tho' these Islands are Parcel of the Domi∣nions of the Crown of England, they are not Parcel of the Realm of England.</HI> The like Observation is made with Respect to the <HI>Isle of Man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Upon this Paragraph his Majesty's Council Remark, that, they have already shewn, that Writs of Error were by the common Law; and as a further Proof, refer to the Register of Writs, which was undoubt∣edly compiled before the Conquest: This Book, by which most of the Writs still in Use are framed, contains a great Variety of Writs of Error: The Power of trying Errors has not therefore been assumed, but belongs to the King's Courts, from Time Immemorial; nor can the Maxim <HI>boni Judicis est ampliare Jurisdictionem,</HI> mean any Thing more than that Judges are in the Distribution of Justice, to exercise every possible Power, which the Law will warrant. And as the Correction of Errors is by the common Law, it extends to all Times and to every common Law Court; the Distinction therefore, that Writs of Error do not lie in the Colonies, which is grounded on the other baseless Distinction, that nothing but the antient common Law of <HI>England</HI> extends to the Colonies, must also appear to be without Foundation; and the supposed Necessity of an Act of Parliament, to give Writs of Error in cer∣tain Cases, which is in evident Allusion to the 31st of El. Chap. I, whereby the Exchequer is authorized to hear and correct the Errors of
<PB N="43" REF="041438_0047_101A89360CAB06D8"/>
the King's Bench, is entirely groundless; for nothing is clearer than that before that Statute, Writs of Error did lie from the King's Bench, to the House of Lords: The Statute therefore was not to give a Writ of Error where it did not lie before; but to carry a Case of Errors thro' the Exchequer to the House of Lords, instead of removing it immedi∣ately to that august and final Tribunal, as was the Practice by the com∣mon Law.</P>
<P>Nor does the Argument in Support of the Position, that Writs of Error did not lie at the common Law, receive any Weight from the Instance assigned, concerning Appeals from <HI>Jersey</HI> and <HI>Guernsey</HI>; for my Lord <HI>Hale,</HI> from whose History of the common Law, his Honour has probably collected this Instance, unfolds the Reasons upon which an Appeal lies from these Islands, to the King in privy Council, which are these; those Islands were Part of the Dutchy of <HI>Normandy</HI>; by the Laws of which Dutchy, an Appeal did lie to the Duke in his Council; and as after the Annexation of that Dutchy to the Crown, the Laws of <HI>Normandy</HI> continued unaltered, and the King of <HI>England,</HI> was Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> the Appeal must of Course be to him in Privy Council.</P>
<P>Besides, this Instance does not shew that a Writ of Error, did not lie to those Islands, but the Contrary is rather to be supposed; because they had Trials by Juries, and therefore it is to be presumed, that an Appeal from their Courts, lies in the same Cases as in the Courts of <HI>England, to wit,</HI> on Errors in Law only; in short, my Lord <HI>Hale,</HI> clearly intends to shew the Reason, why an Appeal lies from those Islands to the King in Council, and not the Nature of that Appeal, which must be presumed, if the same Word, in the same Author, is to be understood in the same Sense, to mean in Case of Error only: Besides, as a Proof of this Matter it is certain, that a Writ of Error did lie to the King's Courts at <HI>Calais,</HI> which was not Parcel of the Domi∣nions of <HI>England,</HI> but a distinct Dominion, dependent on the Crown of <HI>Great-Britain</HI>: Vin. Tit. Error, P. 484, No, 22, 4, Inst. 282: As to the <HI>Isle of Man,</HI> it was antiently an independent Kingdom, governed by its own Laws, which have never been changed to this Day; and in that Island, a Writ of Error is not known in their Law.</P>
<P>But as a Proof, that whatever the Laws of a dependent State may be, they are not to be changed by Authority of the Crown; it appears in
<PB N="44" REF="041438_0048_101A89387286A1A0"/>
the Books, that the Crown can only appoint Judges by Commission, to redress Injustice and Wrong, according to the Law and Justice of the Isle. 4. Inst. 285.</P>
<P>The Three next Paragraphs, as they concern the Charters of some of the neighbouring Colonies, we shall take the Liberty to consider as one; they are these;</P>
<Q><P><HI>In the Charter unto</HI> William Penn, <HI>of</HI> Pennsylvania, <HI>the following Clause is inserted,</HI> saving and reserving to us, our Heirs, and Succes∣sors, the Receiving, Hearing and Determining of the Appeal or Ap∣peals, of all or any Person or Persons, <HI>of,</HI> in, or belonging to the Ter∣ritories aforesaid, or touching any Judgment to be there made or given.</P>
<P>By the Charter of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> the King has reserved to his Subjects there, the Right of appealing to the King in his Privy Council, from the Sentence or Judgment of any Court, or Judicatory in that Province.</P>
<P>In <HI>Connecticut,</HI> as I am informed, Appeals to the King are not reserved by their Charter; nevertheless the Subject there on his Peti∣tion to the King, obtains the Benefit of an Appeal by the King's Mandatory Writ; Obedience to which has never been refused.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Upon these Instances his Majesty's Council remark,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1st. That the Law of the Land, and not the Practice of other Colo∣nies is to be their Guide; nor can such Practice conclude the Subject's Right in this Colony. It is a known Maxim, <HI>Actus me invito factus, non est Actus meus.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. That tho' the Charters of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> and <HI>Massachusetts,</HI> reserve to the King the Right of hearing Appeals, it must be in such Manner as the common Law will authorize, that is in Cases of Error only; and therefore nothing can be argued from the Practice of those Colonies. If they as well as <HI>Connecticut,</HI> have gone into Mistakes in Law, their Conduct can be no Rule for us, <HI>Fortior enim est Dispositio Legis quam Hominis</HI>; and we have his Honour's Declaration at another Time on this Occasion, that Errors when discovered, ought not to be the Ground of future Proceedings, but must be corrected. With Respect to the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> and <HI>Connecticut,</HI> it is well known that they
<PB N="45" REF="041438_0049_101A893C5F370720"/>
have, by Laws of their own making, and in evident Deviation from the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> in the Construction of their Courts, given them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Power of Appeal in Matters of Fact, from the highest to the lowest: It is not therefore to be wondered at, that in those Colonies, as well as in others, (in which we conceive the Law of <HI>England</HI> is not so well understood, nor has been so strictly adhered to as in this Colony) they have run into the erroneous Practice of appealing on Matters of Fact, to the King in Privy Council. And we cannot but be of Opinion, that his Majesty's Lieutenant Governor and Council, of this Colony, in the Execution of their important Trust, ought in Obedience to his Majesty's Instructions, and the Statute of the 7. &amp; 8. of W. 3. to be guided by the known and established Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and not by the uncertain, and perhaps groundless Proceedings in other Colonies.</P>
<P>We cannot therefore agree with the Lieutenant Governor, when he says, in the next Paragraph.</P>
<Q>It is evident from what has been said, that no Writ of Error, can by the common Law lie in the Colonies, because they are not Parcel of the Realm of <HI>England.</HI> No Act of Parliament has extended Writs of Error to the Colonies. The King has not given Authority to the Governor and Council of this Province, to hear and determine on Writs of Error — but has given them Authority to hear and determine on Appeals; their Authority is therefore clearly confined to Appeals, by which the whole Cause is brought before them, in order that if need be, it may be transmitted by farther Appeal, to the King in his Privy Council. — By what Authority, is the Governor and Council of <HI>New-York,</HI> appointed Judges in Error? I can see none — If neither Error nor Appeal lies, the Supreme Court becomes uncontroulable.</Q>
<P>In Opposition to which, his Majesty's Council are of Opinion, that Writs of Error did lie by the common Law, and that no other Writs, than Writs of Error, would lie by the common Law, from the inferior Dominion; because the Latter is not Parcel of, but depends on the For∣mer; and that they lie <HI>ex Necessitate,</HI> because the Law may not be changed, nor the Prince govern the inferior Dominion, which he holds <HI>Jure Coronae,</HI> otherwise than by the Laws of the superior Dominion: That the Power of this Court, does not alone depend on his present most graciour
<PB N="46" REF="041438_0050_101A893EB68FB660"/>
Majesty's Royal Instructions, but was conferred in its original Constitu∣tion, by the Instructions of his royal Progenitors, and Predecessors, by which we are expressly and only authorized to take Cognizance, of Cases of Error. That the Court being thus constituted, no Writ was necessary to be expressly directed, by royal Instructions, for <HI>Quando aliquid mandatur, mandatur et omne, per quod pervenitur ad illud.</HI></P>
<P>That his present Majesty's Instruction, has a necessary Relation to former Instructions, because it concerns a Court, which had a Being before the issuing of the present Instruction; and because it has a neces∣sary Reference to the antient Practice of this Court, <HI>in directing the usual Writ to be issued</HI>; that this Court has no Authority to hear, and determine on Appeals not known in the Law; and by Writ of Error, the Judges of the Supreme Court will be effectually controuled; because by the Law of the Land, they can only err in Matters of Law, upon which either a Demurrer, special Verdict, or Bill of Exception, will in all Cases furnish this Court in the Exercise of its proper Jurisdiction, with every Opportunity of correcting their Mistakes in Law.</P>
<P>But as his Honour has thought proper, to consider more particularly what was offered by those Judges in Construction of his Majesty's 32d Instruction, it will be proper to set forth the Paragraphs on that Head, and give them a particular Answer, they run in these Words:</P>
<Q><P>What has been said I think sufficient—But to remove all Diffi∣culties I can on this Head, I shall next consider the Construction, which the Judges of the Supreme Court have put on the King's In∣struction; for their Purpose they have gone back to preceding Instructions; tho' I think that no Argument from thence can be con∣clusive. It is said that the Words, <HI>in Case of Errors,</HI> being added in the former Instructions, after the Word <HI>Appeal,</HI> the Sense of this last Word must be restrained to shew, that the Design of the In∣struction is to confine the Governor and Council to the Rules observed on Writs of Error. But in Law, the Word Appeal has a certain and determined Signification: The Word Error is often taken gene∣rally to signify any Mistake, and it cannot be confined to the Sense in which Error, is used in a Writ of Error, since no Writ of Error lies in the Colonies.</P>
<P>The next Argument, is from the following Words, in the Instruc∣tion, <HI>to issue a Writ in the Manner, which has been usually accustomed:</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="041438_0051_101A89405CE7F2B8"/>
The Meaning must certainly be in the Manner usually accustomed in Appeals, not in the Manner usually accustomed in this Place, as is pretended; for when the first Instruction was given, there could be no accustomed Manner in this Place, and it cannot at any Time be intended, if the accustomed Manner was erroneous as it certainly is, if it be by Writ of Error. Besides, the Usage in this Place is so weak, and of so short Continuance, that it can be of no Force.</P>
<P>But that the Word Appeal, in the Instruction, is taken in its pro¦per Sense, is evident from the other Words in the Instruction, which cannot he applied to a Writ of Error, viz. <HI>Appellant</HI> and <HI>Appellee,</HI> Terms never used on a Writ of Error, and the Word <HI>Condemnation,</HI> which indicates a new Judgment on the Merits.</P></Q>
<P>His Majesty's Council have already remarked, that this Court was not erected by his present Majesty, but was many Years ago, erected and confirmed as a Court of Errors in express Terms, by his Majesty's royal Predecessors and Progenitors: In this View it was a proper com∣mon Law Court, at the Time when his present Majesty issued his royal Instruction.</P>
<P>And therefore, tho' we agree that the Word Appeal, has in Law a certain and determined Sense, yet as that Word in its legal Sense▪ is ne∣cessarily confined to Matters of Law, and as his Majesty's Council dare not give into so bold an Opinion, that his Majesty by his Instruction, <HI>intended to change the Law, and introduce Appeals upon Matters of Fact, unknown to the Laws of England</HI>; they think it their Duty to under∣stand the Word <HI>Appeal</HI> in the present, as the Word <HI>Appeal,</HI> in Cases of Errors ought to be understood in the former Instruction: And tho' his Honour does not understand the Word Errors, in the former Instruc∣tions, as having any Relation to Writs of Error, but in the vulgar Sense as signifying any Mistake, whether in Law or Fact; yet we cannot but be of Opinion, that the Word ought to be taken in its legal Sense; because any other Appeal is not known in the common Law, than an Appeal for Errors in Law, and we think it our Duty to make the Law, and not vulgar Practice, the Rule for construing as well the former, as the pre∣sent royal Instruction; and that the more particularly, because the very Purport and Design of both, appear to be the Correction of the Judg∣ments of the Courts of Law, for which Reason the Judges of those
<PB N="48" REF="041438_0052_101A8941EFF54090"/>
Courts are expressly prohibited from voting in the Court of Appeals, tho' they may attend to assign the Reasons of their Judgments; and this not only proves (as the Judges have justly observed) that the Appeal in∣tended in his Majesty's 32d Instruction, must be on Matters in which they are incompetent, by having rendered their Judgment already, <HI>to wit,</HI> on Matters of Law, but also that the Appeals directed being from Courts of Law, and from the Judgments of those Courts, in the rendering of which Judgments there cannot in the Nature of Things be any thing cor∣rigible, but Errors in Law; the Words <HI>Appeal</HI> in <HI>Cases</HI> of <HI>Errors,</HI> in the old Instruction, and the Word <HI>Appeal</HI> in the present Instruction, must be understood in the same Sense. Nor can we think it just to at∣tempt to prove that the Word <HI>Errors</HI> in the old Instruction is not to be taken in its legal Sense, by asserting, that Writs of Error do not he in the Colonies, because, whether they will lie or not, is to be determined by that Instruction. For if thereby a Court of Errors is established, as it clearly is, the Writ of Error is of Course given by necessary Implication, agreeable the Maxim already mentioned; <HI>Quando aliquid mandatur, mandatur, &amp; omne per quod pervenitur ad illud,</HI> and another Maxim to the same Effect, <HI>quicunque aliquid alicui concedit, concedere videtur, et id sine quo Res ipsa esse non potest,</HI> and it is evident, that Writs of Error are essential to Courts of Error, because they can exercise no Jurisdiction in Erro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, but by a Writ of Error, to bring the Cause before them.</P>
<P>What his Honour has been pleased to remark, on the Clause in his present Majesty's Instruction, whereby the Governor or Commander in Chief is directed to issue, <HI>a Writ in the Manner which has been usually accustomed,</HI> might be fully answered, by simply observing, that tho' we should agree with the Lieutenant Governor, that those Words must in∣tend in the Manner usually accustomed in Appeals: Yet as the common Law knows of no other Appeals than for Errors in Matters of Law, the Writ usually accustomed by the Law of <HI>England,</HI> must be the Writ intended, which in Appeals from Courts of Record is a Writ of Error.</P>
<P>But besides this, it may not be amiss to observe, that his Honour's reasoning on this Head, is grounded on a palpable Mistake in Fact; for the old Instruction does not contain such a Clause as he supposes.</P>
<P>The Chain of reasoning therefore on this Point is justly this; by the old Instruction a Court of Errors is expressly erected, and consequently the same Instruction gives a Writ of Error by necessary Implication; the
<PB N="49" REF="041438_0053_101A8945170E1980"/>
Court of Appeals spoken of in the present Instruction, must necessarily be the Court of Errors mentioned in the old Instruction, because it di∣rects the accustomed Writ, and therefore the accustomed Writ mention∣ed in the present Instruction, must necessarily intend the Writ of Error implicitly given by the other, and used in Consequence thereof, in a Course of Practice for many Years: So that there can be no Reason to suppose that the Writ which has been usually issued was erroneous, or that the issuing of that Writ at present, must defend solely on what he supposes to be the short, tho' continued Usage in this Colony.</P>
<P>And that Appeals for Error will lie in the Colonies, and that the Prac∣tice of bringing them has been long since used in the Colonies, and ap∣proved of by the King in privy Council, will appear from the Case of one <HI>Jeoffry Jones,</HI> which was an Ejectment for Lands, brought in the Reign of King <HI>William</HI> III. in <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and in which Cause a Ver∣dict was found and Judgment given, and the Judgment was on an Ap∣peal to his Majesty in privy Council, afterwards reversed for Error.</P>
<P>Hence therefore the Argument drawn from the Words <HI>Appellant</HI> and <HI>Appellee</HI> in the royal Instruction, must be of little Weight; for besides that the old Instruction, which expressly, and only relates to Cases of Error, contains the same Words, it is evident, that if, in Law, the carrying up of a Cause by Writ of Error, is an Appeal, the Party Plaintiff must be the <HI>Appellant,</HI> and the Defendant the <HI>Appellee</HI>: Nor will the Word <HI>Con∣demnation,</HI> in the Instruction, furnish the least. Argument in Favour of the Lieutenant Governor's Construction; because, by that Word, is in∣disputably intended the Judgment in the Court below, as will appear from the whole Clause, which directs, that the Appeal shall be allowed, if the Party Appellant gives Security; (1st) to prosecute his Appeal to Effect: 2dly, to answer the Condemnation, and pay the Damages and Costs, it the first Sentence be affirmed. His Honour next proceeds to consider some, and not the most conclusive Arguments urged by the Judges, <HI>ab inconvenienti,</HI> upon which he Remarks thus;</P>
<Q><P>The next Arguments against Appeals are from Inconveniency; tho' they be not material, yet as they may have more Weight than they ought to have, they deserve a distinct Answer.</P>
<P>The first is from the great Expence Appeals must occasion; to this may be answered, that in the Colonies, where Appeals are in Use, and
<PB N="50" REF="041438_0054_101A8946FB2E5C30"/>
where preparatory to an Appeal, the Evidence of Witnesses is at the De∣sire of either Party taken down in Writing, in the common Law Courts, the Expence is not near so great, as in common Suits in this Province; this Expence then must be owing to some other Cause.</P>
<P>It is again objected, that if Appeals be allowed, the Governor and Council, and afterwards the Privy Council in <HI>England,</HI> must sit every Day in the Year, to hear and determine them.—The Supreme Court in this Province sits at most only six Weeks, in the whole Year; suppose an Appeal in every Cause, (an absurd Supposition) the Trial on Appeal cannot take up so much Time as in the Supreme Court, for the Formalities to bring the Cause to Issue, are unneces∣sary in judging on the Merits.</P></Q>
<P>With Respect to his Honour's Remarks upon the Argument drawn from the Expence that would attend Appeals, in the <HI>Pretorian</HI> Way, it may be answered; that tho' the Prosecution of common Suits, in the neighbouring Colonies, is less expensive than in this Colony, yet we are far from believing, that the Charge of prosecuting an Appeal in those Colonies would be less expensive, than the Trial of an ordinary Cause in this. And though the Law is generally cheaper in ordinary Cases, in those Colonies, than in this, yet we conceive that the little Expence which there attends a common Suit, is one of the greatest Evils under which they labour; as by that Means great Encouragement is given to a litigious Spirit, and has been so far improved to the Disadvantage of the Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> that Three Thousand Six Hundred Writs have been returned at the Sessions of one of their County Courts; which we believe may be truly said, to exceed the Number of Writs that are issued <HI>communibus Annis</HI> by all the Courts of this Colony, from the highest to the lowest. But at the same Time we are of Opinion, that tho' the great Cheapness of Law is a real Disadvantage to any Country; yet we think that the Encouragement of Appeals in the <HI>Pretorian</HI> Way, would be an Expence too excessive to be born by the Subject; and there∣fore would furnish just Ground for the Argument <HI>ab inconvenienti.</HI></P>
<P>The Argument urged by the Judges, from the Inconvenience that would attend a continual Session of the Governor and Council, and of the King in privy Council, for hearing and determining Appeals, we think has been greatly misunderstood; for with Respect to the Governor and
<PB N="51" REF="041438_0055_101A894978FCF570"/>
Council, if they are to be a Court of Appeals in the Sense cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for by his Honour, they must take Cognizance not only of Appeals from the Supreme Court, but from all the Circuit Courts, County Courts, City Courts, and Borough Courts, throughout the Colony, which would completely furnish them with Business for the whole Year; and, as to Appeals to his Majesty in privy Council, if they were permitted to lie on Matters of Fact, from all the numerous Colonies in his Majesty's Do∣minions, it is not to be doubted that the privy Council would be obliged to set every Day in the Year, to hear and determine them.</P>
<P>But his Honour has in his Reasons omitted the Consideration of those of the Arguments <HI>ab inconvenienti</HI> which have the greatest Weight. We cannot however avoid concluding with the Judges, that the Appeal contended for, would render the Expence of Trials by Jury useless, and therefore intolerable, and by making the Cause on Appeal, <HI>Res integra,</HI> would open a Flood-Gate to Perjury, encourage a Spirit of Litigious∣ness, and introduce Idleness, to the Ruin of many Families, and the great Impoverishment of the Country, and would be attended with the utmost Danger to the Subject, in the Transmission of original Deeds; the Inspection of which is often Times absolutely necessary (as where a Ra∣zure is the Gift of the Controversy) in Order to do Justice to the Cause: Besides this, the Benefit of a View not only appointed by the common Law, but by Statute, in Land Trials, would be lost to the Subject, on every such Appeal. And therefore, as long as there is any truth in the Maxim, <HI>quod est inconveniens &amp; contra Rationem, non est permissum in Lege,</HI> an Appeal on Matters of Fact, being attended with these Inconve∣niencies cannot lie.—</P>
<P>His Honour proceeds next, to consider what he allows to be the principal Objection against an Appeal on Matters of Fact, on which he speaks thus.</P>
<P>"I come now to the principal Objection, and which has the greatest Weight, that by Judgment on Appeals, the great Privilege of Trial by Jury is taken away, <HI>the great Privilege which Englishmen enjoy above all other Nations</HI>: On this Head several Things deserve Consideration."</P>
<P N="1">1st.
<Q>The Character of the Persons who Judge on Appeals; the Gentlemen of the Council in this Province, and the privy Council in <HI>England,</HI> where on hearing of Appeals, the Lord high Chancellor,
<PB N="52" REF="041438_0056_101A894BB4053320"/>
the Chief Justices of both Benches, and the Lords of greatest Skill and Knowledge in the Law, usually attend: With such Judges, the Verdict of the Jury-will always have its just Weight: Few Men in any difficult Case would not rather trust to such Judges than to the usual Juries in this Country. It is evident from the 33d Instruction, that the King really intended the Benefit of his People, not any Ad∣vantage to himself, by ordering Appeals; for the 33d Instruction, gives an Appeal in Cases of excessive Fines in a less Sum, than in Cases of Property: And the King must have designed that the Me∣rits of the Cause should come before him by the Appeal, otherwise he cannot Judge whether the Fine be excessive or not.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I believe that there is not a Man in this Province conversant in the Courts of common Law, who will not allow, that many iniquitous or false Verdicts have been given in it, and thereby great Injustice done. By the Laws of <HI>England</HI> every Wrong has its Remedy; what is the Remedy in this Case? They tell us the Judge will give a new Trial: But this Remedy depends upon the Will and Pleasure of the Judge; if he will not, the Subject has no Remedy. The Law of <HI>En∣gland</HI> abhors all arbitrary Power, and therefore the King has given his Subjects in the Colonies a Right to Appeal from every iniquitous Verdict, without depending on the good Will or Pleasure of any Judge. If no Appeals are allowed from the Supreme Court of <HI>New-York,</HI> the Court must become uncontroulable; however agreeable this may be to Judges fond of Power, it must be terrible to the Peo∣ple under their Jurisdiction.</Q></P>
<P>His Majesty's Council are seriously of Opinion, that the Privilege of Trials by Juries, which <HI>Englishmen</HI> enjoy above all other Nations, is <HI>in Truth a great and excellent Privilege</HI>: It is a Privilege which stands re∣commended by the Experience of many Ages, and by the tenderest Re∣gard of our Ancestors, for whose Judgment we have the highest Vene∣ration: It is in short the Birth-right of every <HI>British</HI> Subject, and ought to be maintained with the most unrelenting Firmness: But what is still more, it stands fixed, irrevocably fixed, by the known and established Laws of the Land, which the most cogent Reasons can never enable a Governor and Council to alter. Little therefore will it avail in Favour of an Appeal, that the Characters of those who would in such Case be the Judges, are conspicuously eminent and unexceptionable, or that ini∣quitous Verdicts are sometimes given by Juries, or that Men in a difficult
<PB N="53" REF="041438_0057_101A895043682588"/>
Case would rather submit their Property to the Judgment of the Former than the Latter; for besides, that none can be so competent Judges of the Matters of Fact as those of the Neighbourhood, who are acquainted with the Parties, and the Witnesses, and often Times with the Matter in Controversy itself; and besides also the great Security to the Subject, which consists in submitting the Trial of Facts to one Set of Men, and the Determination of the Law upon those Facts to another, (which are Reasons that at first View give a Preference to Trials by Juries) the Impossibility of a Change, even in Favour of a Method, if any such could be devised, that would deserve a Preference, must be a sufficient Answer to any Thing that can be offered on this Head. The Gover∣nor and Council are <HI>Jus dicere &amp; non Jus dare,</HI> and their judicial Ca∣pacity seems to have been designed in the original Constitution of this Colony, and in Imitation of the House of Lords, as the dernier Resort in the Colony, subject however to the Correction of a superior Judica∣tory in <HI>England,</HI> as essentially necessary for the Preservation of our De∣pendence; nor can the Crown (we say it with the most profound Sub∣mission) change the Law of the Land, because the King can do no Wrong. Any Thing short of Legislative Authority, would be inade∣quate to so important a Purpose, and tho' his Majesty may have thought proper to grant Appeals in Cases of Fines, and that perhaps in the Sense contended for by the Lieutenant Governor; yet, this is not in Derogation of the Rights of the Subject, but the Effect of his Majesty's Royal Cle∣mency. By the Policy of Law, all Fines belong to the Crown, and as the King may remit them when he pleases, either in Part or in the Whole, he may without affording them any Cause of Complaint, and in Ease of the Subjects, direct such a Method of enquiring into the Merits of the Cause, as he thinks proper, to enable him to judge on the <HI>Quantum</HI> of the Fine imposed.</P>
<P>With Respect to unjust or iniquitous Verdicts, the common and Sta∣tute Law of <HI>England,</HI> as well as the Practice of the King's Courts, have provided ample Security against them; for besides the Remedy by new Trials which his Honour supposes to be inadequate to the Evil, because it depends upon the Will and Pleasure of the Judge; the heavy Sentence which the Law inflicts by Attaint upon Juries who give iniquitous Verdicts, must be an effectual Redress; the Verdicts impeached by At∣taint, being Matters of Fact, are corrected by another Jury of Twenty-four Men, and the Manner of the Correction proves the strict Attach∣ment of the Law to the Rule, <HI>ad Quaestionem Facti, respondent Juratores,</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="041438_0058_101A8951CBDBA500"/>
the Reversal of the Judgment given in the first Instance, which is always the Consequence of an Attaint prosecuted with Effect, furnishes the most ample Security to the Subject, and satisfies the Demands of the Laws of <HI>England, which abhor all arbitrary Power.</HI></P>
<P>The evil Consequences of dishonest Verdicts being therefore so effec∣tually guarded against by Law, we cannot be of Opinion that his Majesty ever intended by a Deviation from the established Law of the Land, to give his Subjects in the Colonies a Right to Appeal from iniquitous Ver∣dicts, in a Method unknown in the Law, and never applied in Ease of the Subjects in the Mother Country, who are doubtless entitled to an equal Share of the Royal Favour with his Majesty's American Subjects; and that in every Instance of Practice, wherein Errors in Fact are to be corrected, the Office is by Law imposed on a Jury of the Country, is manifested in every Case of Error, <HI>Quod coram vobis residet</HI>; for when a Man assigns Errors in Fact, he ought to put himself upon the Country, for the Jurors shall only be Triers of that, and not the Judges, Yelv. 58. Law of Er. 10.</P>
<P>And on <HI>audita Querela,</HI> which is also grounded on Matter of Fact, a Jury is ever to determine; as if a Release of a Debt given after Judg∣ment, is alledged by the Party in Bar of Execution, a Jury must try the Fact, whether the Release was executed or not.</P>
<P>In short, the common Law knows of no other Appeals on Matters of Fact from common Law Courts, than by Attaint, Error, <HI>Quod coram vobis residet,</HI> and Writ of <HI>audita Querela,</HI> on all which, Juries determine; while on the other Hand, a Cause of Errors in Law is never brought before the Judges, but by <HI>Writ of Error, false Judgment, or Certiorari,</HI> and from Courts of Record, such as our Supreme Court is, by Writ of Error only, 2. <HI>Bacon, Abr. Title Errors</HI> 189.</P>
<P>His Majesty's Council are far from maintaining that no Appeals should be allowed from the Supreme Court of <HI>New-York,</HI> nor can we believe that the Judges of that Court did ever affect so dangerous an Exemp∣tion; on the Contrary, we are of Opinion with those Judges, that <HI>Ap∣peals by Writs of Error,</HI> will undoubtedly lie from their Judgments, <HI>and will effectually prevent that Court from becoming uncontroulable.</HI></P>
<P>The Method of Trials by Juries we think of so much Consequence, that we cannot dismiss the Subject, without animadverting on the Close of
<PB REF="041438_0059_101A8954349257F0"/>
his Honour's Reasons, which were they well grounded, would naturally bring this excellent Method of Trial into Discredit. His Words are these;</P>
<Q><P>Many of the Counties of <HI>England,</HI> tho' they be not of so great Ex∣tent of Territory, are more considerable in Numbers of People, Dig∣nity of Persons, and Value of Property, than this Province is; there∣fore all the Inconveniencies may happen in this Province, which did in the Counties of <HI>England,</HI> while all the Property in those Counties were determined by Judges of the same County. I shall recite them in the Words of Lord Chief Justice <HI>Hale, viz.</HI></P>
<P>All the Business of any Moment was carried by Factions, and Par∣ties: For the Freeholders being generally the Judges, and conversing one among another, and being as it were the Chief Judges, not only of the Fact, but of the Law; every Man that had a Suit there, sped according as he could make Parties, and Men of great Power and In∣terest in the County, did easily overbear others in their own Causes, or in such wherein they were interested, either by Relation of Kindred, Tenure, Service, Dependence, or Application; the Remedy against these Evils which then prevailed, was by Appeal to the King.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Upon this we observe:</HI></P>
<P>That the Evils thus complained of by Lord <HI>Hale,</HI> happened in a very remote Period, when Ignorance and Barbarity overspread the Nation in general; in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> II. which commenced above 600 Years ago, Learning was wholly ingrossed by the Lawyers and the Clergy; the Freeholders of the Counties who were the Suitors to the inferior Courts, were both Triers of the Facts, and sole Judges of the Law; and in Courts where Ignorance presided, and the Judges were of inferior Rank, and owed this Service by the Tenure of their Estates under the me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne Lord, it was not to be wondered at, <HI>That Business was carried by Parties and Factions, nor that every Man sped in his Suit according as he could make Parties, or had Interest in the County</HI>; but that the Ignorance of the Judges, and not the ill Consequence resulting from Trials by Juries, is the Evil complained of by Lord <HI>Hale,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hale's Hist. of c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. Law. <HI>140.</HI></NOTE> appears clearly from the Account he gives in the same Page, of the Method taken by the King to Redress the Evil; <HI>therefore</HI> says the Author,
<Q>The King took another and more effectual Course, for in the 23d Year of his Reign, by Advice of his Parliament, held
<PB REF="041438_0060_101A89576B77CEC0"/>
at <HI>Northampton,</HI> he instituted Justices <HI>itinerant,</HI> dividing the Kingdom into six Circuits, and to every Circuit, allotting three Judges, <HI>know∣ing or experienced in the Laws of the Realm.</HI></Q>
Nor can it be thought probable, that so eminent and able a Judge as Lord <HI>Hale,</HI> could be so inconsistent with himself, as to disparage a Method of Trial, which he has taken Pains to display in every possible advantageous Point of Light; and for this Purpose, has devoted a whole Chapter in his excellent Book, called,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Chap. <HI>12.</HI></NOTE> <HI>The History of the common Law of England</HI>; a Chapter sufficient to convince every reasonable Man, of the peculiar Advantages attending the most excellent Method that ever was devised by human Prudence, for the Trial and Determination of all Facts.</P>
<P>To sum up the Whole, his Majesty's Council are clearly of Opinion, 1st. That omitting the Defects contained in the Instruments under Seal, by which an Appeal is sought in the present Case, an Appeal from the Verdict of a Jury, taking the Word in any Sense, is not known in the Law of <HI>England,</HI> it having been the established and continual Practice, from Time immemorial, to try and determine all Facts by Juries.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. That the Statute of the 7 and 8 W. III. has erected the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> which were in Force at the Time of the Settlement of this Colony, as the Standard of Law in the Colony. 3dly. That his Majes∣ty's Instruction, in which the Governor or Commander in Chief is directed to take Care, that no Man's Life, Members, Freehold, or Goods be taken away, or harmed, otherwise than by established and known Laws, not repugnant to, but as much as may be, agreeable to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> (which is similar to every Instruction hitherto known to us, that has been issued on that Subject since the passing of that Statute) is supported by the aforesaid Statute, and is calculated to enforce an Obedi∣ence to it.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. That in Consequence of the aforesaid Statute and Instructions, not only the Laws of the Colony, but the Practice of it's Courts, have always been in the strictest possible Conformity to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and the Practice of the King's Courts there.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. That an Extention of the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> and the Practice of the King's Courts there, as transferred to this Colony by the said Statute, and enforced by the aforesaid Instruction, has been further en∣forced by solemn Adjudication before the King in privy Council.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="57" REF="041438_0061_101A895A9F4E86C0"/>6thly. That the Terms of his Majesty's 32d Instruction, have a ne∣cessary Reference to such Appeals as were known to the Law of <HI>England,</HI> and had been long used in this Colony; and that no other Appeals than in Cases of Error in Law (which are the only Cases of Appeal provided for in former Instructions) have, until the present Instance, ever been brought here.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. That the Appeal intended by the said 32d Instruction, must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Words of the Instruction themselves, necessarily be an Appeal from the Judgment of the Judges in Matters of Law, and that if the Instruction had intended an Appeal from the Verdict of a Jury, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ning of which, the Judges are never concerned, they, as being the most competent Judges of a Verdict founded on Evidence given before them, would never have been excluded from sitting in the Court above.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. That tho' strictly speaking, there are several Species of Appeals, known in the Law, which are therefore generally called by their peculiar Names, yet the Instances are numerous in the Books, to prove that the carrying up of a Cause by Writ of Error, is in Law called an Appeal.</P>
<P N="9">9thly. That wherever an Appeal is on Matters of Fact, as in <HI>Attaint, audita Querela</HI> and Error, <HI>Quod coram vobis residet,</HI> the Errors are correc∣ted, not by the Judges, but by the Inquest of a Jury.</P>
<P N="10">10thly. That therefore, a Departure from the established Law of the Land, in giving such a Construction to the Terms of his Majesty's 32d Instruction, as would make this Court cognizant of the Cause, as it is now attempted to be brought before us, that is, <HI>on Errors in Fact,</HI> would do Violence to the true Sense of this, as well as the other Instruction of his Majesty, by which constitutional Jurisdictions, and the same Measures of distributing Justice, as are established in <HI>England,</HI> are clearly intended to be transferred to this Colony.</P>
<P N="11">11thly, and LASTLY. That Appeals on Matters of Fact, would not only be inconsistent with Law, the Royal Instructions, and the standing Practice of this Colony, but would be burthensome and ruinous to the Subject, by rendering the first Trial useless, procrastinating Justice, en∣hancing the Costs of Suit, and opening a wide Door for Perjury on the second Trial.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="041438_0062_101A895CE7130570"/>And in Cases wherein the Decision would turn upon an Inspection of Deeds, would render it impossible to administer Justice in the last Re∣move, without subjecting the Party to the utmost Danger of losing the most valuable Evidence of his Title; and in Causes wherein Views may be necessary, would deprive the Subject of the Benefit secured to him by Law. And for these Reasons, we are of Opinion, that this Appeal cannot be received.</P>

<P>BEFORE your Honours proceed to determine the most important Point that ever was before any Court in this Province; a Point on which the Rights of the People, and consequently the future Prosperity of this Colony in a great Measure depend;</P>
<P>I beg you would indulge me with a few Words, in order to confirm what I have already said, when in Compliance with your Request I gave you the Reasons of my Conduct. Your Honours are sensible that this Battery, raised against the Laws by which we have been so long governed, and a settled Practice which has obtained for so great a Number of Years, and which is exactly conformable to the Practice in <HI>England,</HI> is founded on the single Word <HI>Appeal</HI> in the 32d Instruction; and on the <HI>Supposi∣tion,</HI> that nothing else could be understood by it but such Appeals as are agreeable to the Practice of civil Law Courts: For if it was possible to understand it in any other Sense, no one would suppose that the whole System of our Law, which has been built up by the Wisdom of so many Ages, was intended to be overturned by this single Word. In order to shew how groundless this Supposition was, I observed to your Hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that Writs of Error, and the several other Reliefs provided for by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ws of <HI>England,</HI> against a Judgment, were properly termed Appeals; tho' that Word was but seldom used, for the Reasons I then mentioned. And for Proof, I relied on the authority of Dr. <HI>Cowel</HI>: I own this Au∣thority to be but slender, because he was more of a Civilian than a com∣mon
<PB N="59" REF="041438_0063_101A8960C9BBC688"/>
Lawyer; but as I was but just returned from the Country, and had but little Time amidst the Multiplicity of Business which a long and un∣expected Absence crowded upon me, to prepare for this extraordinary Occasion, it was the best I could then produce, tho' I was sure what I asserted was well founded. I could indeed have produced several other Dictionaries, but as they all made Use of the very Words of <HI>Cowel,</HI> and referred to no Authorities, I laid no great Stress on them. I have now an Opportunity of confirming what I then said, by one of the best Au∣thorities in the Law, my Lord Chief Justice <HI>Hale</HI>: And for that pur∣pose I beg Leave to read two Passages in his History of the common Law, Page 150, and Page 48. [Here they were read.] These Autho∣rities I suppose will be a full Confirmation of what I have advanced; and will show that this Appellant is very much mistaken in his Explanation of this Instruction.</P>
<P>For let it be admitted, as I think it certainly must after what I have shewn, that there are Appeals at common Law as well as in the civil Law, is it not evident to a Demonstration, that when it says you shall ad∣mit Appeals from the Courts of common Law, that it must mean such Appeals as are known to the common Law? And if Writs of Error are called Appeals in the common Law, to prove which an unexceptionable Authority has just been produced, and the Instruction says, that for the Purpose of Appeals, you are to issue a Writ in the Manner which has been usually accustomed; does it not appear clear as the Sun, that Writs of Error, or such Writs as are known to the common Law, are hereby directed to be issued? The contrary Explanation must appear to your Honours very unnatural, <HI>to wit,</HI> tho' there are Appeals by the common Law, as well as in the civil Law, yet, when it says you are to admit Ap∣peals from <HI>common Law Courts,</HI> it means you are to admit them in the <HI>civil Law Form.</HI> It means you are to direct the common Law Courts to change the whole Form of their Proceedings in order to comply with the Instruction, and to form a motley Court which shall partake of the Inconveniencies of both the others, and enjoy the Advantages of neither. It means when it directs you to send the usual Writ, that you shall send such a Writ, as both for Matter and Form never was sent to any common Law Court before. It must be evident then, that this can neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Meaning of the Instruction.</P>
<P>Since your Honours have indulged me thus far, I beg Leave to read a few Lines farther in the same Book. The second Reason this great
<PB N="60" REF="041438_0064_101A8963103C8E20"/>
Lawyer gives, why Causes should not come before the Parliament, in the first Instance is, because by that Means the Subject would lose his Trial <HI>per Pares,</HI> and consequently his Attaint, in Case of a Mistake in Point of Issue or Damages, to both which he is intitled by Law. Here we see Chief Justice <HI>Hale</HI> positively says, that the Subject is intitled to a Trial by his Equals, that is, by a Jury, and also to his Attaint in Case of a Mistake in Point of Issue or Damages. If this be a good Reason in the Case here mentioned, it is also a good Reason against trying the Merits of Verdicts in the Court pretended to be erected by this Instruction; for tho' this does not deprive the Subject of a Trial by a Jury, yet it does much worse, it puts him to all the Inconveniencies of that Trial, renders it prodigiously more expensive than ever; and then makes it entirely useless. And it takes away the Remedy by Attaint, which is also here said to be the Subject's Right; for to what Purpose would it be to bring an Attaint against a Jury for giving a Verdict, which whatever it may cost, is not worth one Farthing to either Party, since the Matter must be finally determined by another Set of Judges; who for all Matters of Moment will become the standing Jury in all Cases without being liable to any such Penalty. And thus we should be deprived of Privi∣leges which his Honour agrees with every Body else we ought to enjoy, because they are such as we are intitled to by the common Law, in the most confined Sense of the Word.</P>
<P>'Tis true it may be said, that the Right to bring an Attaint is not to be considered, because in a very long Series of Years, no such Action has been brought. But it cannot be denied, that the Privilege of a Sub∣ject to the Laws of <HI>England</HI> is very great, in this, that he cannot be di∣vested of any Part of his Property but by the Judgment of his Peers, and they not only under the sacred Obligation of an Oath, but also under the Danger of an Attaint if they give a false Verdict. And this is a Privilege no Man in his Wits will ever willingly part with, who knows its Value.</P>
<P>For whatever Contempt may be put on Juries, in the Law they are of the highest Estimation, and no one ought to pretend to be wiser than the Law. The greatest Men have ever valued it as the best Way of trying Facts. And the Lord Chancellor himself, when a Fact is in Issue before him, delivers it to the King's Bench to be tried by a Jury. But the Advantages of this Trial by Juries, are so well described by Chief Justice <HI>Hale,</HI> in his 12th Chap. of the History of the common Law, al∣ready read in this Court, that I dare not presume to do Injury to the Subject, by Encomiums unworthy of its Excellency.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="041438_0065_101A5EDBAAC42A78"/>This Chief Justice, on whom no Man who has not made the Law his Study, ought to be ashamed to pin his Faith, prized Trials by Juries so highly, that in order to shew the Excellency of the common above the civil and other Laws, he pitches upon this and Descents, as two of its principal Perfections.</P>
<P>Therefore, your Honours will put too great a Value on this Privilege, to regard, in determining this most important Point, what is done in other Colonies; because, they have no Power to alter our Laws. If Causes are brought up by Way of Appeal from Verdicts in some of them; if two or three contradictory Verdicts are taken in the same Cause in others; your Honours will clearly see the Absurdity of such a Practice; and while you leave them to plead either Ignorance or Ne∣cessity for not conforming to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> expressly enjoined by his Majesty's Instructions to his Governors, you will zealously sup∣port, according to his most gracious Majesty's Intentions, and Favour to us, every Practice consonant to those whosesome Laws.</P>
<P>Neither is this Appeal in any Manner favoured by <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> and therefore nothing surprised me more than to find that quoted in Favour of an Appeal. The Clause <HI>nulli vendemus, nulli negabimus, aut deferemus Justitiam,</HI> does no more prove that the King is to try every Cause himself, than every Writ or Pleading does, which supposes him present in all his Courts of Justice. This appears from my Lord <HI>Coke</HI>'s Comment on those Words. And to shew how little <HI>Magna Charta</HI> favours such an Appeal as this, I will read the whole Clause from which these Words are taken, and a Part of my Lord <HI>Coke</HI>'s Com∣ment upon it. The Clause runs thus, <HI>Nullus liber Homo capiatur, vel imprisonetur, aut disseisiatur de libero Tenemento suo, vel Libertatibus, vel liberis Consuetudinibus suis; aut utlagetur, aut exuletur, aut aliquo Mode destruatur; nec super eum ibimus, nec super eum mittemus, nisi per legale Judicium Parium suorum, vel per Legem Terrae; nulli vendemus, nulli ne∣gabimus, aut deferemus, Justitiam, vel rectum.</HI> On which my Lord <HI>Coke</HI> says, "against this antient and fundamental Law, and in the Face thereof, I find an Act of Parliament made, that as well Justices of Assize as Jus∣tices of Peace, without any finding or Presentment by the Verdict of twelve Men, upon a bare Information for the King before them made, should have full Power and Authority by their Discretions, to hear and de∣termine all Offences and Contempts committed or done by any Person or Persons, agiainst the Form, Ordinance and Effect of any Statute made and
<PB N="62" REF="041438_0066_101A8967C21789A8"/>
not repealed, &amp;c. by Colour of which Act shaking this fundamental Law, it is not credible what horrible Oppressions and Exactions to the Undoing of infinite Numbers of People were committed by Sir <HI>Richard Empson,</HI> Knight, and <HI>Edmund Dudley,</HI> being Justices of Peace throughout <HI>England</HI>; and upon this unjust and injurious Act, (as com∣monly in like Cases it falleth out) a new Office was created, and they made Masters of the King's Forfeitures. But at the Parliament holden in the First Year of H. VIII. this Act 11, H. VII. is recited, and made void and repealed and the Reason thereof is yielded, for that by Force of the said Act it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> manifestly known, that many sinister and crafty, feigned and forg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Informations, had been pursued against divers of the King's Subjects, to their great Damage and wrongful Vexation: And the ill Success hereof, and the fearful End of these two Oppressors, should deter others from committing the like, and admonish Parlia∣ments, that instead of this ordinary and precious Trial <HI>per Legem Terrae,</HI> they bring not in absolute and partial Trials by Discretion." In short, whoever will support a Practice of this Nature, ought by no Means to refer to Books of the Law; for the Laws of <HI>England</HI> abhor it, and bear Testimony against it in every Page. Neither can it be supported by advancing new Principles, such as these. 1st. The common Law ex∣tends to the Plantations, but the Statute Law does not. 2dly. The Laws of <HI>England</HI> extend to the Plantations, but the Execution being in the King, he can erect what Courts for the Distribution of Justice he pleases. Principles new as these are, unheard, unthought of, before this important Trial between <HI>Thomas Forsey</HI> and <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> one would think needed some Proof, some Authority at least to establish them; for certainly they are not self-evident Propositions. But nothing of the Sort have I heard. On the Contrary, it is supposed by all Civili∣ans, that Colonies carry out with them the Laws of their Mother Coun∣try. And if they do, they must take those with them, which are in Force at the Time they emigrate, because they are familiar and known. They can never upon their Emigration be obliged to have Recourse to those Rudiments of Law, which were first formed by their Mother Country. They can hardly be supposed to be so well acquainted with Antiquity as to know what they are. Neither can any good Reason be given, why they should not reap the Advantages of all the Improve∣ments made by succeeding Ages. Besides, no Man can draw the Line between those Laws which stand upon the Authority of Acts of Parlia∣ment, and that of the common Law: For many Things are by com∣mon Law which first commenced by Acts of Parliament; many seem
<PB N="63" REF="041438_0067_101A896C434BD770"/>
to stand on the Authority of Acts of Parliament, which were before by common Law. So that this Principle, if adopted, would produce more Confusion than a sudden Repeal of all Laws: By these Means the Trials by Battle, and Fire Ordeal, would be again introduced. In short it is not possible to suppose that our most gracious Sovereign, when by his Instructions he directed that the Laws should be administered in a Me∣thod as nearly as possible according to the Laws in <HI>England,</HI> intended we should conform to all the Adsurdities of an ignorant Age. No, his gracious Intentions doubtless were, that we should enjoy the Benefit of those Laws, which by the Improvement of many Ages were wrought up to the highest Perfection, and by this he conferred on us the greatest Blessing which his princely Wisdom could bestow, and took the best Method of securing the Dependence of the Colonies. So preposterous is it to suppose that it would be secured by depriving the People of this Colony of the Laws of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>As for the other Principle, that the King can erect what Courts he pleases for the Distribution of Justice, it is not only contrary to Law, but it is big with the most dangerous Consequences. The King it is true is the Fountain of Justice, and the Execution of the Law is in him, by the Constitution of <HI>England</HI>; but the Mode of dispensing it is fixed by Law, and unalterable, but by Act of Parliament. He may erect as many new Courts as he pleases, but they must determine accord∣ing to the Course of the common Law, and proceed on Facts found by Juries. But that he can erect Courts which shall have a Power to try Causes in what Manner they please, must appear extremely shock∣ing to an <HI>English</HI> Ear, and to any one who has the least Idea of the <HI>English</HI> Constitution. This is expressly provided against by <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> as appears by the Authority just now read. On this Principle a Court similar to the Inquisition might be erected, and Torture intro∣duced. By these Means the grand Difference between an <HI>English</HI> Sub∣ject, and a Subject of <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> or <HI>Turkey,</HI> would be annihila∣ted; for that consists more in the Mode of administering Justice to them, than in the Laws themselves. Happy for us we live under a Monarch patriotic and beneficent, who glories in being the Sovereign of Free-Men, not of Slaves; and will reject with Abhorrence every Preroga∣tive which may be exerted to the Ruin of his Subjects. Of this we had an ample Proof, when one of the first Acts of his Reign was to secure the Independence of the Judges, by parting with what was an un∣doubted Prerogative of his Crown; and I dare venture to prophesy
<PB N="64" REF="041438_0068_101A896EAAA20448"/>
that whoever seeks to recommend himself to his most gracious Majesty's Favour, by undertaking to prove that his Subjects are no better secured in their Liberties and Estates than those of the most absolute Monarchs, will appear to have taken the worst Way of making his Court. —</P>
<P>Before I conclude, as in the Prosecution of this Scheme, not only Juries but the Practisers of the Law, and the Judges have been treated with Disrespect; Justice obliges me to say, that I have a pretty general Acquaintance with the Practisers, especially with those that are most eminent, and that from what I have observed of their Conduct, I can declare, that I know none who do not behave themselves with a Can∣dour, Integrity, and Disinterestedness, which does Honour to their Profession. And of this they have on this Occasion exhibited a Proof. They suppose the Appeal now brought illegal and injurious to the Country, and for that Reason, not one of them could be prevailed on to give his Assistance to, but all rejected the Project with Disdain. This will long be remembered to their Honour.</P>
<P>As for the Judges they or some of them are reproached, as forgetting their Duty in endeavouring to raise the Passions: On which I shall observe in the Words of a great Lawyer; that a Judge is not to be defamed or vilified with Respect to his Parts, Fitness for his Place, &amp;c. for if this were allowed, it would be impossible to keep in the People that Veneration for their Persons, and Submission to their Judgments, without which it is impossible to execute the Laws with Vigour and Suc∣cess. What Grounds there are for accusing them of raising the Passions I know not. When such Principles are advanced as tend to overturn a Constitution, of which every <HI>Englishman</HI> is fond, his Resentment will naturally be raised; and when the Mischiefs arising from such Principles are either shewn or hinted at, his Anger will be still more inflamed. But who ought to be accused of raising the Passions when this is the Case, I must submit to the serious Consideration of your Honours. Certainly our Duty obliges us to present to your Honours a full View of the Inconveniencies which must attend this Alteration of the Law.</P>
<P>It does a peculiar Honour to Juries, Lawyers, and Judges, that those who impeach their Conduct, declare against the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> that excellent System which can hardly be considered without Admiration, or spoke of without Rapture, and which our most Gracious King is so far from endeavouring to deprive us of, that he has particularly directed his
<PB N="65" REF="041438_0069_101A8970682C7838"/>
Governors to conform to them as much as possible, by an Instruction, which lately and accidentally came to our Knowledge, whereby his Go¦vernor or Commander in Chief, is directed to take Care that no Man's Life, Member, Freehold, or Goods, be taken away or harmed in this Province otherwise than by the established and known Laws, not repug∣nant to, but as nearly as possible, conformable to the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> This shows the Propriety of the Observation, that the Judges ought not to be directed in their Duty by such Scraps of Instructions as may from Time to Time be communicated to them: For had we been directed in our Conduct by the Thirty-second Instruction, and misunderstood it, to signify in Appeal against a Verdict, we should have introduced a Prac∣tice, not only contrary to this Instruction by which the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are enforced, but to make Use of the Words of the Oracle of the Law, contrary to and in the face of <HI>Magna Charta.</HI> This Instruction alone I should imagine would be a sufficient Inducement to your Honours, to sup∣port the Practice of the Law here, in every Thing which is consonant to the Laws at Home.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st Thing I beg Leave to trouble your Honours with is, an Act of Parliament passed in the 4th <HI>Henry</HI> IV. Chap. 23, which runs thus: Whereas as well in Plea real, as in Plea personal, after Judgment given in Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of our Lord the King, the Parties be made to come upon grievous Pain, sometime before the King himself, sometime before the King's Council, and sometimes to the Parliament, to answer thereof, of new, to the great impoverishing of the Parties aforesaid, and in the sub∣version of <HI>the common Law of the Land.</HI> It is ordained and stablished, that after Judgment given in the Courts of our Lord the King, the Parties and their Heirs, shall be thereof in Peace until Judgment be un∣done by Attaint, or Error, if there be Errors, as hath been used by the Laws in the Times of the King's Progenitors.</P>
<P>This Act I hope will be sufficient to answer the Objections of the most scrupulous; for it appears not only to be made in order to prevent such Appeals as are now contended for, but also in Affirmance of the common Law. So that I confidently expect your Honours will unanimously re∣ject this Appeal, and approve of our Conduct.</P>

<P>The humble Petition of <HI>Robert Ross Waddel,</HI> of the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> Merchant, legal Representative of <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> is most re∣spectfully presented,</P>
<P><HI>Setting forth,</HI></P>
<P>THAT in an Action of Trespass, Assault and Battery, commenced in the Supreme Court of Judicature for said Province, by <HI>Thomas Forsey</HI> against <HI>Waddel Cunningham,</HI> a Verdict was given against the Defendant, for <HI>One Thousand and Five Hundred Pounds</HI> Damages, besides Costs of Suit, which Damages your Petitioner, who is Attorney for the Defendant, conceiving excessive and unreasonable, desired the Attorney and Counsel in the Cause, to Appeal from the said Verdict unto your Honours, as a Court of Appeals; which was absolutely refused by the said Attorney and Counsel.</P>
<P>That thereupon your Petitioner applied to <HI>George Harrison,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a Notary Public, attending in Court at the Request of your Petitioner, to move the Court for such Appeal, which he did accordingly, requesting the Court to make a Minute of his Motion, which was refused for the present<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but the Court declared they would consider of it till next

Morning, when the Defendant's Counsel advised a Motion to be made to set aside the Verdict, the Damages being excessive, which being made accordingly, the Court resolved not to grant it.</P>
<P>That thereupon a Paper in Writing was delivered to the Court, pray∣ing the Defendant might be allowed to appeal from the Verdict and Judgment thereupon, and a Bond tendered at the same Time, with good and sufficient Security to pay unto the Appellee, all such Damages, Costs and Charges, as should be awarded, adjudged, or decreed by your Ho∣nours on said Appeal, agreeable to the 32d Article of his Majesty's Royal Instructions to his Excellency Governor <HI>Monckton</HI>; a Copy whereof certified by the Deputy Clerk of his Majesty's Council, was also presented to the Court: Which Prayer and Request, as also your Peti∣tioner's further Request then made, that the Court would be pleased to admit and Order an Entry to be made of such Motion for an Appeal, and the Tender of such Security as aforesaid, were also refused by the Court.</P>
<P>And as your Honours have already declared that an Appeal from the Verdict and Judgment as aforesaid, cannot be brought before your Honours, as a Court of Appeals; your Petitioner most humbly begs Leave to apply to your Honours, to grant an Appeal to his Majesty in his privy Council — To that End therefore,</P>
