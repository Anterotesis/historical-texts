<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>LUKE, XII. 15.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And He said unto them, Take heed, and beware of Covetousness:—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the Words of our Blessed Saviour. The occasion of them was this. One of the Com∣pany said unto Him, <HI>Master, Speak to my Brother, that he divide the in∣heritance with me.</HI> Some Expositors suppose that he intended to injure his brother. How∣ever that be, our Lord informs him that he came to a wrong Person, <HI>Man, Who made me a Judge, or a divider over you?</HI> Christ's Kingdom was not of this World, nor did He take to Himself a Civil Authority to judge, and dispose of Men's civil Rights and Pro∣perties. No, He came into the World to Pur∣chase an Heavenly Inheritance for His Peo∣ple,
<PB N="2" REF="001997_0003_0FBA4F026790B538"/>and to give them a sure Title to it; but not to Settle their Earthly Possessions. Tho' He was the <HI>Lord and Heir of all things; yet He had not where to lay his head.</HI> And He calls upon His Disciples to be ready to forsake all, and follow Him.</P>
<P>No doubt our Saviour discerned Cove∣tous Worldly Spirit in this Man, who in∣stead of seeking to Him about the Spiritual concerns of his Immortal Soul, was so Eager to have Him concern himself in his temporal Affairs which was a thing forein from that great Errand upon which our Lord Jesus Christ came into the World. Our Saviour therefore takes this Opportunity to Caution his Hearers against <HI>Covetousness. Take heed,</HI> The Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>is often referr'd to the Mind. It signifies, to behold with our bodily Eyes, and also with the Eye of the Soul, <HI>the Under∣standing.</HI> To see a thing with Consideration, and Observation, to Know. And sometimes it is rendred, Take heed, and <HI>Observe your selves.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Beware:</HI> The Word in the Ori∣ginal signifies to keep Watch, to keep as a Prison is kept, to take heed or beware of "<HI>Preserve your selves</HI> from <HI>Covetousness.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The word signifies; says <HI>Beza,</HI> an immoderate desire of getting, even with the Detriment of others. It is translated, <HI>greedi∣ness, Eph.</HI> 4.19. It signifieth an unlawful
<PB N="3" REF="001997_0004_0FBA4F13452DAB18"/>desire of having more; Word for Word, a <HI>having more.</HI> It is here translated <HI>Cove∣tousness.</HI> Which is <HI>an undue Valuation of,</HI> and <HI>immoderate craving this World's Goods.</HI> This Sin discovers it self in an Excessive Esteem of Worldly Riches, in an Idolatrous trust and confidence placed in them; in Un∣righteous acts, and the taking unlawful Mea∣sures for the getting of Wealth; and in an immoderate Love to it, and delight in it when gotten; and a criminal backwardness and unwillingness to part with it to Pious, Publick, and Charitable Uses. It discovers it self also in a Discontentment with God's Allotment, and an irregular Endeavour after more than God-is pleas'd to allow us: In beholding our Neighbours Estate with a Covetous Eye; <HI>our Eye being Evil because God is good.</HI> It discovers it self in an immo∣derate Solicitude of Mind about getting and keeping; in an inordinate fear of losing what we have gotten, and in excessive grief upon the account of Worldly losses and dis∣appointments. This Sin discovers it self in a Niggardly with-holding from our selves that which is Meet for our comfortable and decent Subsistence; and in with holding from others that which the Law of Charity re∣quires us to bestow upon them: or in the temper and disposition with which we give; when we do it grudgingly, and not of a ready Mind. The Doctrine may be this.</P>

<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q>It is a great Duty incumbent on us, to take heed, and beware of the Sin of Covetousness.</Q>
<P>Under this Doctrine, We may Consider what it is to take heed, and beware of Covetousness. And then offer a few things to shew the Obligations we are under to beware of this Sin.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>What is it to take heed, and beware of Covetousness?</HI> When may we be said to Obey this Command?</P>
<P>For answer to this Inquiry.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To take heed, and beware of Covetous∣ness implies, <HI>That we heedfully observe the Temper of our Minds; and Examine whether this Lust doth not prevail in us.</HI>
<P>If we would take heed, and beware of this Evil, We must observe our selves Care∣fully; We must compass a diligent Search, and look narrowly into the State of our Souls, and seriously Consider whether this I fist have not the Possession of us. The Distemper must be known, the wound <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, before a pro∣per Remedy can be applied. Our hearts are naturally <HI>deceitful, and desparately wicked.</HI> A
<PB N="5" REF="001997_0006_0FBA4F1865404528"/>deceived heart oftentimes leads Men aside when they are not duely sensible of it. Par∣ticularly, Men are very prone to flatter them∣selves in this iniquity. How often doth it lie hid under the Specious Names of <HI>Fruga∣lity,</HI> and good Husbandry? How often are Men guilty of it under a fair pretence of a due concern about their Temporal Affairs? Certainly then if we would beware of this Sin, we must turn the Eyes of the Soul in∣ward, and by a reflex act of the Mind look and see whether this Lust doth not give Law to us in the Course of our lives; or at least, in some degree, prevail. We should Pray to God to Search us; and we should search and try our ways, that we may know if this way of wickedness be found in us. We must put that general Rule into practice respecting this particular Case; 2 Cor. 13.5. <HI>Examine your selves, — prove your own seves. Know ye not your own selves,</HI> — We should Examine by the rules of God's Word, whether our Desire, Esteem and Trust be not inordinately plac'd on Worldly Riches; whether our hearts do not go out after them with too much Vehemency; and whether our pursuit of them be not too Eager and Earnest.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>We must look to our selves, and Watch a∣gainst the First Motion and Inclination of our hearts towards this dreadful Evil.</HI> We must
<PB N="6" REF="001997_0007_0FBA4F235E563C40"/>watch that we may Espy and Suppress this hurtful Lust in the beginning and rise of it; that it may not Conceive and bring forth. We should labour to stifle these Corrupt In∣clinations in the birth, and not suffer them to grow, and gather strength. It is difficult to raise our Minds to heavenly things, and to set our Affections on things above; but the descent is Easy, and the Motion of the Soul towards the Earth as it's Centre, will be so much the Stronger and Swifter by how much the longer it is continued, and by how much the nearer we approach to it in our de∣sires and affections. Here then it is a good Rule, <HI>Obsta Principiis,</HI> Resist this Sin in the beginning of it. And for this End we should be jealous over our selves with a godly jea∣lousy.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>By the Grace of God, we must Mortify the inward Inclination and Principle; that Root of bitterness whereby we are defiled.</HI>
<P>This is implied in the duty which we are here Exhorted to. There are the fruitful Seeds of all Sin in our Corrupt Natures. Our <HI>Ori∣ginal Sin</HI> is the Root from whence all <HI>Actual Transgressions</HI> do Spring. Now we must strike at the Root. We must Cry to God for the influences of His Holy Spirit to subdue our Corruptions. By the Spirit we must Mortify the deads of the Flesh, and change the corrupt
<PB N="7" REF="001997_0008_0FBA4F2604C02FC0"/>biass of our Minds, whereby we are inclin'd to this, and other Sins. Particular Lusts are as the Limbs or Members of that body of Death which is in us; and we must by the Spirit Mortify them. Col. 3.5. <HI>Mortify therefore your Members which are upon the Earth;</HI> Fornication — and <HI>Covetousness,</HI> which is Idolatry. It is not enough that this Lust be <HI>Restrain'd</HI> as to the outward acts, and more Notorious out-breakings of it; but it must be <HI>Crucified and Slain.</HI> It must be put off, and laid aside. By looking to JESUS in the Exercise of Faith we should draw Strength from Him, who is our Head of Influence, to Subdue this Sin in the Principle of it, that it may not reign in our Mortal Bodies. We must Pray that we may Experience the Power of Christ's death, this Sin being Nail'd to his Cross and Crucified with Him.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>We must heedfully observe our Temptations to this Sin, and beware of yielding to them.</HI>
<P>Many are the Temptations which our Sub∣til Adversary the Devil makes use of to draw us into this Sin; and therefore we must be Watchful, not being ignorant of his devices; and resist him stedfastly in the Faith. He that will carelessly run into the way of Temptation, will be in the utmost Danger of being foil'd and over-come. Now there is no Condition or Circumstance of Life that
<PB N="8" REF="001997_0009_0FBA4F27708E7F08"/>is Exempted from this Temptation. If we are rising in the World, and have fulness of business, we may be tempted to Consume too much of our Time and Tho'ts in the Eager pursuit of Earthly things, under this pretence, that when we have gotten a great Estate, We will then <HI>Seek the things which are Above:</HI> Whereas we are Commanded to seek <HI>First</HI> the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness. And he that will not do this <HI>Presently,</HI> hath no true desire to do it <HI>at all.</HI> We must therefore Watch against such a Temptation as this. Again, If we have gotten <HI>an Estate,</HI> Satan will be ready to tempt us <HI>to deny God,</HI> and to say, <HI>Who is the Lord?</HI> To make <HI>Idols</HI> of our Silver and Gold, and to bow down and worship them. And thus also if we are <HI>Poor,</HI> Satan will be ready to take occa∣sion from hence to tempt us to Covet our Neighbours Goods; to <HI>Steal</HI> and <HI>take the Name of God in vain.</HI> This Lust is call'd the Lust of the <HI>Eye,</HI> and therefore we should make a <HI>Covenant with our Eyes,</HI> and beware of look∣ing upon any thing that is our Neighbour's, with an Envious, Coveting Eye. We shou'd Watch and Pray lest we enter into this Temp∣tation.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>We must take heed, and beware of a Selfish Spirit; and Exercise our selves in acts of Charity and Bounty.</HI>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001997_0010_0FBA4F28DE4C7070"/>
A Narrow contracted Spirit is in an especial manner dispos'd to this Vice. 2 Tim. 3.2. —<HI>Men shall be lovers of their own selves, Co∣vetous,</HI> —! But now an heart inlarged in love to God and Men: an heart gene∣rously inclined to do good to others; will fly this base Lust. Such a Man will be freely willing to lay out himself, and to spend a suitable proportion of his Estate in doing good to others, instead of cleaving to it with an immoderate affection. As far as a selfish Spirit prevails, we shall think that lost, which we bestow on our Neighbour; and shall be ready to seek our <HI>own,</HI> without a due regard to <HI>his</HI> profit; yea by doing wrong to him. Whereas we are Exhorted, 1 Cor. 10.24. <HI>Let no Man seek his own, but every Man anothers Wealth.</HI> We must therefore seek after a con∣trary frame of Mind, a liberal and charitable Spirit: and watch for suitable opportunities to Exercise this Grace. We should devise liberal things, be ready to distribute, willing to communicate. The more the Grace of Charity is strongthned in us, the more will this vile affection be weakned: for these are contrary.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>6. We must take care to lay up our Treasure in Heaven.</HI>
<P>If we are diligent in the pursuit of hea∣venly
<PB N="10" REF="001997_0011_0FBA4F2AAF5F3A50"/>Riches, our hearts will in a good Mea∣sure, be rais'd above the things of this World; for <HI>where our Treasure is, there will our hearts be also.</HI> If we are <HI>Spiritually-Minded,</HI> we shall sit loose from <HI>Earthly things.</HI> If we set our Affections on things <HI>Above,</HI> we shall take them off from things <HI>below.</HI> And therefore he that would beware of Covetousness must take off his Eyes from beholding Vanity, the Riches of this World, which perish in the using; and look at the things which are not seen, which are Eternal. As far as our love to Jesus Christ, and our Esteem of his Unsearchable Riches, do prevail; so far will our love of this World abate; and we shall not seek it with so much Earnestness and Greediness.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>7. We must look to it, and improve the Means of Grace which GOD hath appointed to preserve us from this, and other Iniquities.</HI>
<P>There are Ordinances and Means of Grace appointed by God, in the diligent attendance upon which, the People of God are kept from falling, and preserved blameless to his heavenly Kingdom. These must therefore be diligently improved. We must look to it, and take heed that our worldly Cares and Business do not make us neglect them; or attend upon them in a cold and formal Man∣ner. If we would beware of Covetousness,
<PB N="11" REF="001997_0012_0FBA4F3357A30E50"/>we must see to it that we do not rob God, and defraud our own Souls, by not allowing Sufficient time for religious Duties. We should Read God's Word with Care, Attend upon the Preaching of it with Heedfulness and Constancy; not neglecting the Assembling our selves together for the Publick Worship of God. Psal. 119.36. <HI>Incline my heart to thy Testimonies, and not to Covetonsness.</HI> These two are here oppos'd, and therefore if we receive God's Word into good and honest hearts, we shall be delivered from this base Lust. If we would beware of Coretousness, we must diligently husband the Precious Opportuni∣ties, the Golden Seasons, which we enjoy on the Lord's Day: We should Watch, and take heed that we be not hindred by the hurries of Worldly business from <HI>Remembring the Sab∣bath,</HI> and preparing for it. And thus we should also be careful to Attend on the Publick So∣lemnities on other days, whether Stated or Oc∣casional. Again, We must be instant in Prayer. We should go to the Throne of Grace daily in Secret Prayer, to ask Grace and Strength to help us against this, and other Iniquities. We should Cry to God that He would not lead us into Temptation to this Sin; but deliver us from this deadly Evil. We must Watch also, and see to it that we reserve Sufficient and Seasonable Time for Family-Prayer. If we suffer our Worldly business to shut out this <HI>Duty,</HI> the Spirit of
<PB N="12" REF="001997_0013_0FBA4F344EE873B8"/>the World hath already obtain'd a dreadful ascendent over us, and will still further prevail. Again, We should take Time to Meditate on what we Read or Hear. In a particular Man∣ner, when we come from the House of God on the Lord's Day, it would be very profi∣table for us to Retire, and Apply our Minds to the Truths we have heard, by close Me∣ditation; that these may be well digested, and so become Food and Nourishment to our Souls. To conclude this head, We should seriously consider of the Vanity of all Earthly things, of the Shortness, and Uncertainty of the Time of this present Life, which is the Only Time wherein we can enjoy them. We should consider that our Worldly Goods are Talents lent to us by God, to be im∣prov'd in His Service; and not to be con∣sumed on our Lusts: And He will shortly call us to a strict Account what use we have made of them. Such Meditations as these by God's blessing, might help to Mortify our inordinate love to this World and the things of it.</P></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I might have said, that if we would be∣ware of Covetousness, <HI>We must take Care that we be not involved in too much Worldly Business.</HI> We must take heed, and beware of such a Multiplicity of Worldly Concerns as shall necessarily swallow up too much of our Time.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="13" REF="001997_0014_0FBA4F35C5F55460"/>
II. <HI>Why should we take heed and beware of Covetousness? What Obligations are we under to beware of this Sin?</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>We must beware of Covetousness, Because Covetousness is an hainous Iniguity, forbiden in the Law of God.</HI>
<P>Covetousness is in Scripture call'd Idolatry, and is rank'd with some of the most atrocious Crimes. The <HI>Covetous Man says to Gold, Thou art my hope, and to fine Gold, Thon art my Confidence.</HI> Instead of making the Name of the Lord his strong Tower, he makes Riches his strong City; and they are as an high Wall in his Conceit. He gives his Earthly Possessions that Esteem and Love, which are due to God alone. Surely then this Sin is hainous in the Sight of God. And according∣ly it is strictly forbiden in His Word. The Tenth Commandment is, <HI>Thou shalt not Covet,</HI> —Eph. 5.3. But Fornication, and all Uncleanness, or <HI>Covetousness,</HI> let it not be once named amongst you, as becometh Saints. This Sin is so contrary to the Spirit of Christianity; so unbecoming the holy Voca∣tion of Saints; that the Apostle would have them take care that it might not so much as once be said that it was found among them.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="14" REF="001997_0015_0FBA4F38A34382F8"/>
2. <HI>Because a Man's Life consisteth not in the Abundance of the things which he possesseth.</HI>
<P>Thus it follows in the Verse wherein is our Text. This is the Argument which our Blessed Saviour makes use of to disswade His Disciples from this Sin; and there is great weight in it. The true Comfort of Life doth not flow from great Plenty, nor de∣pend upon it. No, <HI>Nature is Content with a little.</HI> If we have Food and Raiment, we may live joyfully; provided the temper of out Minds be suited to our Condition. The ground of true Peace, and good Living lies within; in a Spirit wean'd from the World, and resign'd to the Disposals of Providence. He is not the happy Man that hath a great Portion of the things of this World; but he that hath an heart to make a good use of that which he hath, and to take the Comfort of it. Now this is the Gist of God. Eccl. 3. 13. <HI>And also that every man should Eat and Drink, and Enjoy the</HI> good <HI>of all his labour, it is the gift of God.</HI> And this rich Gift is often befrowed on them that are not the Rich of this World; so that the little which a Righteous Man hath is better to him than the abundance of many wicked.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Covetousness is a Sin which dreadfully de∣files the Mind, and Exposeth to other hurtful Lusts.</HI>
<P><PB N="15" REF="001997_0016_0FBA4F41895EDD60"/>
Where this undue Valuation of Earthly Riches prevails, it Estrangeth the heart from God, and renders it Earthly, Sensual, Devilish. It indisposeth the Mind to all that is Spiritual∣ly good, and fills it with corrupt Desires and vile Affections; Our worldly gain doth then become <HI>filthy lucre.</HI> We read, Mark 7.21. &amp; 23. <HI>From within, out of the heart of men proceed evil Thoughts, Adulteries, Fornications, Murders, Thefts, Covetousness.</HI>—All these Evil things come from within, and desile the Man. O Polluted Soul that liest grovelling in the dust: How art thou debased! How art thou desiled! And this Lust leads to the Commission of other Sins. 1 Tim. 6.9. <HI>But they that will be rich, fall into Temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts:</HI>—The immoderate desire of Wealth many times prevails on Men to Lie, Steal, Oppress &amp; Over-reach their Neighbours. Yes, sometimes to Murder them. Thus when <HI>Athan</HI> saw the goodly Babylonish Garment, and Two hundred. Shekels of Silver, and a Wedge of Gold; he Coveted, and took them, <HI>Joshua</HI> 7. 21. Thus <HI>Ahab</HI> Coveted <HI>Naboth</HI>'s Vineyard, and slew him.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>If we are under the government of this Sin We shall despise and reject the Offers of the Gospel.</HI>
<P>In the dispensation of the Gospel, perishing Sinners have the Unsearchable Riches of Christ hid open, and freely offered to them upon the
<PB N="16" REF="001997_0017_0FBA4F429FE880B8"/>most reasonable Terms. The Lord Jesus Christ calls upon us to come to Him, that we may obtain <HI>durable Riches and Righteousness.</HI> He hath purchased Spiritual Blessings suited and proportion'd to the Wants of our Souls; and offers to bestow them upon all such as are willing to receive them in the Gospel-way. He calls upon us to Come and <HI>Buy without Money, and without Price.</HI> But that man whose heart goeth out after his Covetousness, will have no heart, no inclination to Come and receive these Blessings. When invited to come to Christ, and feast on that Provision which He hath made, he will say, in his heart at least, I must go to my Farm, to my Merchandize; pray have me Excus'd. Or if he doth come and sit under the Outward Dispensation of the Word, yet he will not truly Come to Jesus Christ that he may have Life. His case will be like that of the Young man, who, when Com∣manded to Sell that he had, and give to the Poor, <HI>Went away sorrowful,</HI> Matth. 19.23. Now we must in the frame and temper of our Minds be ready to lay down all our Temporal Interests at Christ's feet; or we can't be His Disciples. Luke 14.33.—<HI>Whosoever he be of you, that for∣saketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my Dis∣ciple.</HI> But how shall we be able to do this while the World hath the possession of our hearts? It is as easy for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle. <HI>We can't serve God <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> While we pant after the
<PB N="17" REF="001997_0018_0FBA4F43D5AD6870"/>dust of the Earth, we cannot hunger &amp; thirst after Righteousness; we shall not obey the Gospel-call, and seek <HI>First</HI> the Kingdom of God. If this Lust prevails, it will choke the good Seed of the Word, so that we shall not bring forth fruit to perfection. Matth. 13.22. <HI>He that received Seed among the thorns, is he that heareth the Word, and the care of this World, and the deceitfulness of Riches choke the Word, and he becometh unfruitful.</HI> Worldly minded men may have some good Motions, some Convictions in hearing God's Word; but then alas! this treacherous Lust renders them fruitless and in∣effectual.</P></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>This Sin will Expose us to Sorrow in this Life, and if persisted in, to Eternal Misery in the World to come.</HI>
<P>1. Tim. 6.10. <HI>For the love of Money is the root of all Evil; which while some coveted after, they have erred from the Faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</HI> There is a Wo de∣nounced against such as live in this Sin: Wo to him that Coveteth an Evil Covetousness:— There are many who by their greedy pursuit of worldly gain do pierce themselves through with many Sorrows. God is provok'd to blast them in their worldly business, or to Curse their blessings. And in the conclusion they will be Miserable indeed. When the Covetous man may be ready to bless himself with the rich
<PB N="18" REF="001997_0019_0FBA4F458270DCD8"/>Fool, and to say, Soul thou haft much goods laid up for many Years; take thine Ease, Eat, Drink and be Merry; then GOD may say, Thou Fool this Night shall thy Soul be requi∣red of thee, <HI>For so is he that layeth up Treasure for himself; and is not Rich towards God.</HI> By this Sin the Souls of Multitudes have been plung'd into Perdition. The Laws of Men do not punish this Abominable Vice; but tho' such Sinners may Escape the Punishment of Men, yet they can't Escape the righteous Judgment of God. O No! They that live and die un∣der the guilt and dominion of this Sin, must be shut out of Heaven, and suffer the venge∣geance of Eternal fire. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.5, 6. For this ye know, that no Whoremonger, nor-Un∣clean person, nor <HI>Covetous man who is an I∣dolater, hath any Inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ, and of God.</HI> Let no Man deceive you with vain Words; for because of these things cometh the Wrath of God upon the Children of disobedience. And Riches will not profit in that day of Wrath.</P></ITEM>

<P N="1">USE, I. Learn hence, <HI>The Folly of such as take no Care to preserve themselves from the Sin of Covetousness.</HI></P>
<P>The Wisdom or Folly of Men is very much
<PB N="19" REF="001997_0020_0FBA4F485C4EBFF8"/>discover'd in the judgment and estimate which they make of things. Surely then every Co∣vetous Person deferres that appellation, <HI>Thou Fool!</HI> For they prefer Earth before Hea∣ven, the vain short-liv'd Enjoyments of this Life before Substantial blessings; the things that are not, before Eternal Realitics. Their way is their Folly. Such may think themselves <HI>Wise</HI> in their Generation, but their Egregious <HI>Folly</HI> appears in the value which they put on Worldly Riches. They prefer the dust of the Earth before the Pearl of great Price. They Sell their Souls for very nought. <HI>For what shall it profit a Man if he shall gain the whole World, and lose his Soul? Or what shall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</HI> O that such might be Convinced of their folly before it be too late!</P>
<P N="2">II. Learn, <HI>That the Prevalency of this Sin calls for Humiliation and Lamentation.</HI></P>
<P>It is Lamentable indeed to see how much a Worldly Spirit prevails among us, and that notwithstanding the many frowns of GOD upon us in our Trade and Business. Alas! alas! How apt are we to have our Hearts full of the World; to be cumbered about many things, so as to neglect the <HI>One Thing Need∣ful?</HI> How apt are we to be over much con∣cern'd about what we shall Eat and Drink, and where-withal we shall be Cleathed; and
<PB N="20" REF="001997_0021_0FBA4F516036EED8"/>at the same time to be cold and indifferent in the great Concerns of our Souls? Alas! There are many who do not take heed, and beware of Covetousness, and hence it is in a great Measure that we grow so Careless in the great Matters of Religion. Many are very Hot and Eager in their pursuit of the World, and therefore Slothful in business, and <HI>Not fervent in Spirit, serving the Lord.</HI> Is not a Glorious SAVIOUR lightly Esteem'd? Are not the precious Privileges of the Gospel Low-priz'd Commodities with many? O that our Heads were Waters, and our Eyes a fountain of Tears. that we might weep Day and Night for this! O that we could Mourn with such a godly Sorrow as shall work in us a Repentance never to be repented of! The Lord Rain down Righteousness upon us, and Revive His Work in the midst of us! The Lord pour out His Holy Spirit upon us, and help us to Seek the Things that are Above more ge∣nerally, more fervently. This must bring on the golden Age which we are looking and waiting for.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Let us all be Exhorted to take beed, and beware of Covetousness.</HI></P>
<P>This is a Sin which doth Easily <HI>beset us,</HI> and it is of very fatal Consequence. O let us then be prevail'd with to <HI>Observe</HI> our selves, and to use our Earnest Endeavours to
<PB N="21" REF="001997_0022_0FBA4F5519B4A488"/><HI>Preserve</HI> our selves from this Vice! We must by the Grace of God Mortify and Subdue this Lust, or it will prove ruinous and destructive to us. Let us then Cry to God that He would vanquish this Enemy of our Salvation.</P>
<P>Let such as are under the Government of this, and other Iniquities, be Exhorted to break off their Sins by Repentance. Be Earnest with God to cleanse you from this and all other Sins; to heal your Souls; and parti∣cularly to Cure this Distemper. You are destitute of true Grace, and can't Engage in this great Duty you are Exhorted to, unless GOD by His Almighty Power Change the biass and temper of your Minds.</P>
<P>Let the Children of God be more Careful and Watchful over themselves. <HI>Keep your Hearts with all diligence,</HI> and beware of all approaches towards this Sin. If you would keep your selves in the Love of GOD, you must not love the World, neither the things that are in the World.</P>
<P>To Conclude, Let them that are <HI>Rich</HI> in this World, take heed that they do not <HI>trust</HI> in uncertain Riches; but in the Living GOD, who giveth us all things richly to Enjoy: That they do good, that they be Rich in Good Works, ready to distribute, willing
<PB N="22" REF="001997_0023_0FBA4F55E9D5DAA8" MS="y"/>to Communicate. Laying up in store for themselves a good Foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on Eternal Life.</P>
<P>Let the <HI>Poor</HI> of the Flock Trust in the Lord and do good, and verily they shall be fed. Heb. 13.5. <HI>Let your Conversation be with∣out Covetousness, and be content with such things as ye have; for He hath sold, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</HI></P>
