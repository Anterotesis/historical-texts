<HEAD>A TREATY AND CONVENTION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WE, HENRY SEYMOUR CONWAY, Major General of His Majesty's Forces, Colo∣nel of a Regiment of Horse, and Groom of His Majesty's, Bed-chamber.</P>
<P>IN the name of His Majesty, the King of Great-Britain, by virtue of the full powers given to Us,</P>
<P>MAKE KNOWN, That we have agreed upon the articles hereafter specified to have their full force and entire execution, between the troops of their Britannic and Most Christian Majesties, in what∣ever part of the world the belligerant or auxiliary armies of the two nations may be; and have con∣cluded the present treaty accordingly, by virtue of the full powers respectively communicated, as follows.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ART. I.</HEAD>
<P>ALL prisoners of war, of what quality, sort or condition soever, without any exception, made during the present war between the land forces of the two powers, in what country soever it may be, shall be exchanged, or ransomed within the
<PB N="4" REF="015353_0003_0F98D7014238A250"/>
space of one month, to commence from the day of signing the present cartel, as is more fully ex∣plained in the 24th article. And the Generals commanding the belligerant or auxiliary armies, in what part of the world soever it may be, shall agree upon a place where the first exchange or ransom shall be made, of the prisoners to be on each side reciprocally delivered.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ART. II.</HEAD>
<P>ALL prisoners of war of the said troops with∣out any exception, who shall be made on either side after the first exchange or ransom, shall be sent back <HI>bona fide,</HI> fifteen days after their deten∣tion, or as soon as may be, by exchange of prison∣ers of like ranks or equal value, or others making compensation for the difference, or shall pay their ransom upon the terms hereafter mentioned, viz. in German florins, at the rate of sixty kreutzers each, making two livres, ten sols, French money, or two shillings and two pence farthing English.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ART. III.</HEAD>
<P>A REGISTER book shall be kept of the prisoners made by the belligerant and auxiliary armies, in which the numbers sent back on each side in every month shall be specified, in order that upon the first day of every subsequent month, there may be transmitted on each side, a list of those who shall have been received and returned, in order that within eight days afterwards, the exceeding num∣bers which one side may owe to the other may be exactly and without difficulty paid. The advance money which shall have been made to the prison∣ers,
<PB N="5" REF="015353_0004_0F98D702021470B0"/>
shall also be then reckoned, that it may be re-imbursed at the same time, and all accounts settled and discharged without being carried to the next month. And upon the first exchange or ran∣som of prisoners on each side, the advances which may have been made to them, shall be liquidated according to true lists which shall be produced.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ART VI.</HEAD>
<P>As often as prisoners shall be sent back on ei∣ther side, a list shall be sent with them, and deli∣vered to the commanding officer at the place to which they shall have been conducted, who shall give a receipt specifying the numbers and ranks of those he receives, in order to be accounted for every month, as is above mentioned.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ART. V.</HEAD>
<P>AND to the end that no difficulty or dispute may arise, either with respect to the posts or ranks of of∣ficers on either side, or to the ransoms which ought to be paid for each of them, it has been thought proper to specify the posts and ranks which are in the belligerant and auxilliary armies, and to fix the prices of them as follows.</P>
