<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following collection of songs, idle and trifling as they may seem at first view, will, it is hoped, have a further use than mere amusement.</P>
<P>The songs are principally Naval and Military, join'd to a few others that have a tendency to ex∣cite that love of our King, of our country, and of Liberty, which, in the breasts of Englishmen, are one and the same thing; and which, of all the passions, affords the noblest stock, upon which to graft the Military Virtues. It were to be wished that there was greater choice; how∣ever, the man whose bosom is open to the glow of patriotism and of glory, will hear few of them without some worthy feelings.—What is wanting in sentiment and poetry, may be often supplied by the energy and masculine tones of the music; and when both combine, the soul is raised to a grateful pitch of gallant enthusiasm, the emo∣tions of which make lasting impressions, and give the soldier a taste for those hardships and dan∣gers, which he would otherways undergo with reluctance, as mere points of duty.</P>
<P>The British troops have for some years, had to do with an enemy that has never as yet beheld with steady countenance, the glare of a rank of bayonets; and the navy, skulking pirates alone to contend with, full of trick, but without bot∣tom.—Men who, altho' of English descent, are
<PB N="ii" REF="016530_0003_0F9C8B232144E438"/>
thus debased by engaging in pursuits repugnant to all sense of honour, justice and humanity. —There is now the prospect of a tougher task for both. The established armies and navies of the great European powers, (composed of soldiers and seamen, train'd to firm service, and full of officers possessed of a high point of honour and military ardour,) present a very different field for their ambition, and call for a full ex∣ertion of all their ancient virtue.—A field, in which superior valour and discipline will not only command that respect which is ever their own, but insure complete success; in which, the de∣cision will depend more upon the arms than the legs, and in which the most strenuous grasp will always reap a full harvest of glory. There the firm soldier will not be balked of his object by the illusive shifts of a shrinking enemy, nor obliged to imitate practices despised, and indeed heretofore unknown to the British troops, in or∣der to gain, at best, a negative triumph; but will have fair occasions, amidst the serious but liberal contentions of civilized war, to dis∣play all the virtues of his profession, and contrast the awful qualities that sway the fate of battle, with that humanity which alone can gild his lau∣rels with true splendor, and stamp a sacred seal upon his merit.</P>
<P>To those who have any knowledge of the hu∣man heart, a knowledge of all others the most essential to an officer, and who are aware of the powers of music and poetry over the mind of man, it is unnecessary to say much in favour of this at∣tempt.—With others of lighter minds, it may possibly incur ridicule and excite to laughter, but until such gentlemen are pleased, by giving the
<PB N="iii" REF="016530_0004_0F9C8B23E1924CA0"/>
reasons of their merriment, to show whether their censure is more owing to the accuteness of their wit or the depth of their judgment, it is in vain to contend with them. In the mean time they will have an opportunity of amusing them selves occasionally, with a song that they might not so readily procure a copy of, and so far they will allow there is no harm done.</P>
<P>To readers of taste and sentiment, it is need∣less to observe, that many of those odes breathe a pure spirit of liberty, warlike ardor, and pa∣triotism, adorned with much of the fire, ima∣gination, and melody of genuine poetry: Some of a more tender nature, throw a mild and plea∣sing lustre upon the military professions and the duties attending them; while others of a coarser cast, are peculiarly calculated to engage the people and strengthen their attachment to their King, country, and its constitution, by combining the interests of their enjoyments and appetites, as well as their rights, with the duties of good citi∣zens: Of those, many may appear not to deserve a place, but the popular taste has stamped a va∣lue upon them which ought not to be disputed— Even the British Grenadiers, unworthy as the words are of the subject, will reach the heart of every English soldier.</P>
<P>An officer of service, if possessed of a poetical genius, might certainly, in compositions of this kind, inculcate the most essential points of mili∣tary duty and honour, by adapting the words and music to the various operations of war.</P>
<P>In a light infantry song, for instance, the 1st verse to represent that corps turning out upon an alarm, and forming in front of its wigwams— the music irregular, bouncing, elevated. The
<PB N="iv" REF="016530_0005_0F9C8B25623E8678"/>
2d verse, advancing upon the enemy into cover, the music sprightly, animated, but regular.—In short, a good quick-step tune. The 3d verse, firing, gaining ground, and operating to the flanks —the music broken, confus'd, elevated. The 4th verse, a bloody pursuit—the music rapid, crowd∣ed, harsh. The 5th verse, the action decided and resistance at an end, the soldiers yielding to the impulse of pity and humanity, sparing and protecting the vanquish'd—the music in melting tones of tender sympathy, unbending the high wound spirits to the softer, but equally manly feelings of generous compassion.</P>
<P>In a Song for the heavy foot, the line to be represented as moving on to battle, steady, firm, and slow.—The music solemn, regular, <HI>décidé.</HI> Then engaged in close action and charging.— The music lofty, strenuous. Lastly, the enemy routed, the line leaving the pursuit to the light troops, and employed in regaining its order, preparatory to a second attack.—The music more calm and regular, with some swells of triumph.</P>
<P>The Highland March is singularly suited to such a subject. The first part—the line in march. The second part or chorus—engaged, and the few last notes resuming its order.</P>
<P>A Song for the Cavalry might represent that body as availing itself of its advantages.—If against horse, the squadrons advancing with velocity to the charge, avoiding all use of fire arms, and trusting entirely to the momentum of their horses and the points of their swords, ral∣lying instantly to their standards, after the disorder necessarily arising from the shock, and carrying every thing before them by the joint
<PB N="v" REF="016530_0006_0F9C8B262162E3E8"/>
effect of their cohesion and impetuosity.—If against infantry, the squadrons taking shelter from the effect of their fire, by plunging among them, and, once in, remaining there to keep them down—If in pursuit, the horse abandon∣ing themselves at all hazards without hesitation upon the enemy, to retard their flight.</P>
<P>Many other general points of duty, and of interest might be interwoven among the imagery in these Songs, as equally suitable to all of them; such as silence—obedience—to stand by the colours—to adhere to their officers and to their comrades—to keep up their fire, and rely chiefly on their bayonets or swords—the little loss that troops ever suffer in action, compared to the slaughter in flight—the triumph and ad∣vantages of victory, with the misery attending captivity, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The above hints may be of use to those gen∣tlemen, who, although not bred to the profes∣sion of arms, may be disposed to assist this design by their poetical exertions. To Soldiers it is not meant to prescribe rules—their ideas will naturally keep the proper bounds, and their ge∣nius unconstrained make bolder efforts.</P>
<P>The Corps of Artillery well deserve to have a Song apart, but it must come from themselves.</P>
<P>With regard to the Navy, it would require the knowledge of a thorough bred Seaman, joined to great powers of imagination, and a warm predilection in favour of his country and pro∣fession, to enable a man to compose any thing worthy of the subject.</P>
<P>At present when the warlike spirit of the na∣tion is thoroughly roused, this Book may be look∣ed into by others as well as military men, and
<PB N="vi" REF="016530_0007_0F9C8B26DF4BBFD0"/>
therefore the occasion is proper for taking no∣tice of an unworthy and narrow prejudice, which in England not only prevails among the lower people, where alone it is excusable, but is also received by an order of men, who both from their rank in the community and general edu∣cation, ought to entertain more liberal and just opinions.</P>
<P>Many of the country gentlemen indulge in an ungenerous jealousy and dislike of the Bri∣tish Army that does little honour either to their knowledge of the constitution or of the history of their country. Those who truly understand the nature of the government of England, its situation and commercial interests, perceive the unavoidable necessity of standing forces, not only to support the power of the nation by pro∣tecting its foreign establishments, and to com∣mand the forbearance and respect of its neigh∣bours, by enabling it to act offencively against those who may adventure to injure or insult it, but also to secure us from the sudden enterprizes of the immense armies kept ever on foot by the enemies of England and of liberty, within twelve hours sail of our coast. Brave as the people of Britain are, time is necessary to form and train them to arms, and it requires a guarded and cautious hand to introduce gradually the sub∣ordination necessary to qualify the militia to act in any degree in concert for the general pur∣poses of service, and to cherish at the same time that high and independant spirit which renders Englishmen when undisciplined the worst, and when disciplined the very best soldiers of the world.—For this purpose too the instructions of the officers of the army and the example of
<PB N="vii" REF="016530_0008_0F9C8B27A47AF188"/>
the troops are both essentially necessary; and granting it practicable by this means to put the militia in a few months in a condition to cope with men who had passed their lives in arms and had been long inured to war, it would still re∣quire a proportion of thorough bred officers to assist in conducting and fighting it, as well as a train of regular artillery and a good cavalry, which, with many other necessary aids, can on∣ly be derived from a permanent military esta∣blishment. In fact, the militia and the army are equally necessary to the power and security of the British Empire, and most justly has the former been termed the shield, the latter the sword of England: But he who asserts that a militia is alone sufficient or equal to all the oc∣casions of war, must either be uncapable of counting, or prompted by some bad design.</P>
<P>A brave militia, conducted by officers who knew the extent of its powers, and exacted no more from it than was to be expected from its discipline and experience, might certainly in a country so singularly strong as England is from its inclosures, render every hedge a bloody en∣trenchment to an invading enemy, with the co∣operation of a certain proportion of veteran foot to steel the edge of the points of attack, so as to enable the nation to adopt an offensive mode of defence, (the only one worthy of the spirit of Britons or of success,) and take the lead in every service which required that coolness and pre∣cision of manoeuvre in the face of an enemy, that alone can enable troops to attack and re-attack with confidence and effect, and which is scarce to be attained without long practice and the habit of danger.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="016530_0009_0F9C8B2861A20BE0"/>Perhaps there has only been two periods since the restoration in which the militia of England could be deemed in any degree equal to the in∣ternal defence of the country—in the war of 56, after two years of great exertion and dili∣gence, and at present, when a twelvemonth has been heartily employed by the united consent of all men to prepare it—at both times they have been formed under the instruction, and stimulated by the example of very gallant and highly disciplined standing armies.</P>
<P>It has been a custom to cite the brilliant mi∣litary successes of the Edwards and the Henries as proofs of the inutility of standing forces; but before this plea is urged, it may not be im∣proper to recollect that France and Spain were in those ages severally divided within themselves, as well as unconnected with each other; and their kings, with very little authority, scarce any revenue, and no army at all; whereas at present these monarchs have entire command of the properties and persons of their subjects, an immense revenue, 500,000 regular troops at their nod, and are closely united, with the same objects in view.</P>
<P>With regard to the Navy, no doubt without its support we could neither be powerful abroad, nor safe at home, and were fighting at sea alone in question, it is equal to every thing; but it cannot sail against the wind, it cannot be every where at the same time, nor can it follow an in∣vading enemy on shore.</P>
<P>Without the advantage of a superior marine, as well as of a willing constitutional militia, an army of 200,000 men, with a number of strong fortresses, would scarce be sufficient to secure
<PB N="ix" REF="016530_0010_0F9C8B29232DDC00"/>
Great-Britain against the House of Bourbon. As it is, 30 or 40,000 made soldiers, under officers who know how to employ them with oeconomy, and draw from the militia the aids it may be ca∣pable of, will, whilst our navy is in condition to dispute the dominion of the sea, prove a full match for any force that an enemy may in an un∣guarded moment, or in consequence of a favour∣ing wind, or of a successful sea action find means to land. But the man who from his enthusiasm for liberty, should desire to see this very small comparative proportion of standing forces further reduced, must have discovered with the rebel Con∣gress, that the French king is the best protector of our rights and constitution, and therefore wish to give him an opportunity of reforming the errors of our government, by introducing amongst us 60 or 80,000 of those legislators, usually employed by his predecessors to establish peace, liberty and happiness among their neighbours.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of this cast must indeed be little read in history not to have in mind, that to the virtue of a standing army we owe a restoration and a revolution without bloodshed, waste or confusi∣on; and the reduction of two rebellions, sub∣versive of all liberty and property, at times when the nation seemed resigned to its fate, or over∣whelmed with despondency—and also that to the virtue of the army it has been often owing that the promoters of sedition have been prevented from endangering real liberty by destroying all order and government.</P>
<P>All circumstances weighed, it cannot but ap∣pear to those who are superior to prejudice, and capable of taking a comprehensive and liberal view, that, in the present state of the world, a
<PB N="x" REF="016530_0011_0F9C8B29E56712C0"/>
standing army is essential to the security of the British empire against foreign attacks—conse∣quently to the existence of the rights and proper∣ty of the inhabitants; and that it is of equal im∣portance to the great objects of liberty, that this army should not be mercenary, but have an in∣terest in the constitution of its country. Certain restraints are no doubt necessary to command the obedience and subordination of the military to the civil power, and to crush in the bud all attempts that might be made by unprincipled men to turn against the people those arms which it is only ho∣nourable to bear in their defence.</P>
<P>But those who endeavour to undervalue the military character, or to make unnecessary en∣croachments upon its professional rights, or by inferior usage and invidious distinctions try to estrange the troops from all attachment to their country and interest in the constitution, can on∣ly stand acquitted of treason against the freedom of their fellow-subjects, at the expence of their intellects.</P>
<P>Whilst the army is held in that estimation which its actions heretofore well claim, and which is the best security for its behaviour in future, it will continue to be full of officers, who from their education, property and rank in the kingdom, must have an interest in the well-being of the na∣tion, superior to all views of military command or emolument; seconded by soldiers, whose na∣tural attachment to their country will be con∣firmed by the share they are allowed in its credit and happiness.</P>
<P>But should the profession of arms ever be held in disrespect, and those that follow it unnecessarily deprived of the common rights of citizens, or ex∣posed
<PB N="xi" REF="016530_0012_0F9C8B2AF26B0350"/>
to insult and oppression, then indeed the army may become mercenary, as no man of ho∣nour or property will remain in it, and those who do, will naturally favour every change, having nothing to lose and every thing to gain.</P>
<P>As the writer of these lines may possibly be guessed at, and those who are disposed to judge with severity, may among many other faults, cen∣sure the expressions as too strong or hazarded, and the language as not sufficiently chaste or indeed correct, he begs leave to be allowed in extenuation of his offences to observe, that licences which might be extremely improper in a Sermon, may perhaps admit of excuse in a preamble to a Book of Songs. In other respects, if he should succeed in drawing the attention of officers to an object that appears to him useful, he is little solicitous about the appearance he himself may make upon this occasion, and with much indif∣ference gives up his literary character to the wrath of whatever enraged critic may choose to exercise his gall upon it; recommending it to the gentlemen of that family, when they shall find their bile overheated by so doing, to quit the Preface and apply to the Songs, which will probably excite some unusual feelings of candor and good humour, that, however ill they may suit the temper of a Critic's mind, will certainly contribute to the health of his body.</P>

<LG>
<L>THE Lark was up, the morn was grey,</L>
<L>The Drummers beat reveille;</L>
<L>The jolly soldiers on the ground,</L>
<L>In peaceful camp slept safe and sound:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Only one poor soldier who,</L>

<L>Wand'ring thro' the silent grove,</L>
<L>There to vent his plaintive love.</L>

<L>For women are whimsical, changeable things,</L>
<L>Their sweets, like the bees, they are mingled with stings,</L>
<L>They're not to be got without toil, care and cost,</L>

<L>What scheme then can I try?</L>
<L>But like a hapless lover,</L>
<L>Now lay me down and die.</L>

<L>Minerva came that way,</L>
<L>In armour bright and gay,</L>
<L>And thus to him did say:</L>

<L>Rise, soldier, rise,</L>
<L>I'll take you by the hand,</L>
<L>And I'll lead you thro' the land,</L>

<HEAD>HISTORY of the WAR.</HEAD>
<LG>
<OPENER>Tune: <HI>Come here false fair, &amp;c.</HI></OPENER>
<L>ARISE Britannia strike th' attentive ear,</L>
<L>With our brave deeds perform'd in mo∣dern war;</L>
<L>Sing how thy sons, warm'd with thy grandsires fire,</L>
<L>To conquest, wealth, and glory re-aspire.</L>
<L>The goddess hears and smiles; elate to tell,</L>
<L>How Albion rose to fame, how Gallia fell,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<OPENER>Tune:—<HI>Give ear to a frolicksome ditty.</HI></OPENER>
<L>Come listen a-while to my story,</L>
<L>'Tis fit for true Britons to hear,</L>
<L>How England resumed her glory,</L>
<L>And Frenchmen resumed their fear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<OPENER>Tune:—<HI>The Attic fire.</HI></OPENER>
<L>When gentle peace's olive branch,</L>
<L>Had still'd our jars with faithless France,</L>
<L>Britons their arms lay by;</L>
<L>But France, whose faith is all a joke,</L>
<L>The sacred bond of honour broke,</L>
<L>And ev'ry treaty's tie.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<OPENER>Tune:—<HI>The Twitcher.</HI></OPENER>
<L>Then says our good king,</L>
<L>'Tis a very hard thing,</L>
<L>Friend Lewis should be so uncivil:</L>
<L>Since all bounds he o'er leaps,</L>
<L>I will seize all his ships,</L>
<L>And blow all his forts to the devil, brave boys, &amp;c.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<OPENER>Tune—<HI>If you had but listen to what, &amp;c.</HI></OPENER>
<L>Then strait he sent out as brave a train,</L>
<L>As ever courted fame on land or main;</L>
<L>Their mighty acts will dignify my song;</L>
<L>Some I'll repeat, for all would be too long.</L>

<OPENER>Tune—<HI>Watkin's breeches.</HI></OPENER>
<L>Have you not heard how Marlbro' burnt</L>
<L>Their shipping at St. Maloes;</L>
<L>Maloes, Maloes, shipping at St. Maloes;</L>
<L>Stores, provisions, ships and all,</L>
<L>He burned at St. Maloes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<OPENER>Tune—<HI>Ally-Croaker.</HI></OPENER>
<L>This work when compleated, with hearts void of fear, sir,</L>
<L>To Cherburgh their course they directly did steer, sir,</L>
<L>To Cherburgh, whose works, near an age had employed, sir,</L>
<L>But in one Glorious day, was by us, sure, de∣stroy'd sir:</L>
<L>But first we sent a trumpeter on seeing their alarm sir,</L>
<L>To tell them our business in order and form sir.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<OPENER>Tune—<HI>Lord Thomas he was a bold forrester.</HI></OPENER>
<L>But when he came to Cherburgh gate</L>
<L>He knocked hard at the ring,</L>
<L>And who was so ready as the Governor,</L>
<L>To let the bold trumpeter in.</L>
<L>What news, what news thou bold trumpeter,</L>
<L>What news dost thou bring unto me.</L>
<L>We're come to destroy both your bason and works</L>
<L>And that is bad news for thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<OPENER>Tune—<HI>'Tis woman that seduces all mankind.</HI></OPENER>
<L>Confounded at the news, with meagre face,</L>
<L>Thus the poor governor bewail'd his case.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<OPENER>Tune—<HI>The charge is prepar'd.</HI></OPENER>
<L>The English are come, our fate is decree'd,</L>
<L>Ah! toutes les saintes aie pitie de nous!</L>
<L>Such force and such ships sure no strength can impede,</L>
<L>The devil confound all the hellish crew.</L>
<PB N="127" REF="016530_0139_0F9C8B8C221791D0"/>
<L>Then farewell fair town, noble bason adieu,</L>
<L>Morblieu! I must fly, would you could so too;</L>
<L>Here sets our bright sun, here begins our disgrace</L>
<L>For the British with Irish no Frenchman can face.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<OPENER>Tune—<HI>Our goodly ship she was laden deep.</HI></OPENER>
<L>So the works we burnt and the stores we sunk,</L>
<L>And the governor he did run away;</L>
<L>And the flags we brought unto Old England,</L>
<L>For to show that we had won the day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<OPENER>Tune—<HI>The Abbot of Canterbury.</HI></OPENER>
<L>'Twas our brave forefathers renowned of yore,</L>
<L>Spread death and destruction on false Gallia's shore;</L>
<L>Thus our Edwards and Henries, our Bembows and Shovels,</L>
<L>Us'd to thrash the French rascals within their own hovels.</L>
<L><HI>Derry down, &amp;c.</HI></L>

<L>NO peace with Frenchmen were I to direct,</L>

<L>To the gates of Versailles shou'd our cannon ad∣vance,</L>
<L>And the grenadier's march should frighten all France.</L>
<L><HI>This my boys we'd do with glee</HI></L>
<L><HI>For Royal George and liberty,</HI></L>
<L><HI>George the third and liberty.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Come fill your glasses, drink with me,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The words are George and liberty.</HI></L>

<L>Let's and pray 'em and slay 'em on land and on main,</L>
<L>We have, my lads, often, and why not again?</L>
<L>Their Cressy and Poictiers and Agincourt shew,</L>
<L>What we, boys, when pitted with Frenchmen can do.</L>
<L><HI>To action then, my boys, with glee, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How oft we've been cheated by art and chicane.</L>
<L>But now we can tell them such efforts are vain:</L>
<L>That feuds are destroy'd, and that party's a joke,</L>
<L>And now we're united, we're not to be broke.</L>
<L><HI>But one and all will fight with glee, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whene'er the King pleases to say do it now,</L>
<L>Hawke, Tyrrel and Saunders, brave Granby and Howe,</L>
<L>Shall burn, sink, and plunder, and lower their notes,</L>
<L>In spite of the devil, and flat-bottom boats.</L>
<L><HI>To deeds like these they'd go with glee, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See our rocks that defend us and taunt 'em with scorn,</L>
<L>See our prudent young monarch, to whom a son's born;</L>
<L>See, of traitors regardless, he smiles on his throne,</L>
<L>For he knows that each heart in his kingdom's his own.</L>
<L><HI>And that each arm would strike with glee, &amp;c.</HI></L>
