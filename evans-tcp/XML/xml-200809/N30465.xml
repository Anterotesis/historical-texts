<Q><BIBL>PSALM LXXXV. 10.</BIBL>
<P>Mercy and Truth are met together: Righteousness and Peace have kissed each other.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY friends, at a solemn marriage-supper there is usually a friendly company who meet together; and when, at such an occasion, all things are managed with sobriety and decency, it is very joyful and pleasant to the parties concerned, to see the members of the meeting, with mutual kindness to one another, harmoniously gracing the solemnity: Even so <HI>at the marriage-supper of the lamb,</HI> I mean, the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, which we have been celebrating, there is a joyful company, not of men and women, for that would make but a poor earthly meeting; not yet of saints and angels, for that would make but at best a mean creature-meeting; but it is a glorious delightful company of divine attributes and perfections, in the sweetest concord meeting together, and embracing one another. This wonderful conjunction of divine excellencies is the friendly company that meets to∣gether, to put honour upon this nuptial solemnity; and to see them thus harmoniously embracing one another in the
<PB N="4" REF="040455_0003_101645CC33AD3F80"/>
salvation of sinners, <HI>is the sweetest sight that the bride, the lamb's wife, shall ever see at the marriage-supper,</HI> whether it be at the lower or upper table. There is a great meeting in <HI>this house,</HI> but an infinitely greater in this <HI>text</HI>; a meet∣ing of divine excellencies, to grace the solemnity of the mar∣riage-supper of the lamb: <HI>Mercy and truth are met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</HI> When God made heaven and earth out of nothing, he made them by a word, without any other ceremony; but, when he made man, there was some particular solemnity, a grand council, as it were, of the glorious Trinity called; <HI>Come, let us make man after our image.</HI> But now man having unmade himself, if God hath a mind for the praise of his own glorious grace to make him up again, <HI>by a new creation in Christ Jesus,</HI> there must be a more glorious solemnity yet; not only a council of the adorable Trinity, but a grand meeting of all the at∣tributes of God, to consult their own glory that was marr'd, and reconcile their own interests, and seemingly contradic∣tory claims: For the sin of man had brought real confusion among all the creatures of God on earth, yea, and seeming war among all the attributes of God in heaven, concerning the execution of the sentence of the law upon mankind, the transgressor thereof; some of these attributes, such as <HI>Mercy,</HI> saying, if the sentence of death be executed upon them, how shall I be glorified? Others, such as <HI>Truth,</HI> saying, if the sentence be not executed, how shall I be glorified? Is it to be expected that such opposites can meet together? Or, if they meet, that they will agree together cordially? Yea, tho' it be beyond the expectation of men and angels, yet behold, it is here celebrated with a song? <HI>Mercy and truth are met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Psalm</HI> consists of a <HI>prayer of faith,</HI> and an <HI>answer of peace.</HI> 1st, The Church's <HI>prayer,</HI> from the beginning to the 8th v. where they are praying for the removal of many tokens of God's displeasure they were under, notwithstand∣ing
<PB N="5" REF="040455_0004_101645CEA6582980"/>
their return out of the <HI>Babylonish</HI> captivity. 2<HI>dly,</HI> The <HI>answer of peace</HI> that is made to their prayer, from v. 8. and downward. We have here the psalmist listning and waiting for the answer; <HI>I will hear what God the Lord will speak</HI>; the answer itself in general is peace, <HI>He will speak peace to his people,</HI> &amp;c. If he give not outward peace, yet he will sug∣gest inward peace, speaking that to their hearts by his Spirit, which he had spoken to their ears by his word. Whatever other sort of peace and prosperity they enjoyed, when at length the children of the captivity, after a great deal of toil, had gained a settlement in their own land, yet peace with God, and spiritual prosperity under the <HI>Messiah's</HI> king∣dom, was the great thing here promised, and prophesied of; and that is a peace that lays the soul under the strongest ob∣ligation to keep at a distance from all sin, which is the greatest folly, and to beware of backsliding thereto. <HI>But let them not return again to folly:</HI> For true peace with God brings in war with sin. But this is further explained in the main leading part thereof, namely, <HI>salvation</HI> and <HI>glory,</HI> ver. 9. <HI>Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.</HI> Now, whatever other salvation be here imported, Christ is the great salvation intended. When he is near in view, then the believer cries out, with old <HI>Simeon, Now mine eyes have seen thy salvation</HI>: And, whatever other glory and honour be here imported Christ is the chief glory here intended: When he goes away from a land, then <HI>Ichabod, the glory is departed</HI>; but, <HI>where he abides, glory dwells</HI>: for he is called, <HI>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of his people</HI> Israel. But now, if we would know what sort of glory it is that appears when Christ is revealed, why it is even the glorious harmony of all the divine attributes illustriously shining in him, who is both <HI>our salvation</HI> and <HI>our glory; Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</HI> Now, tho' these words may be applied to the happy meeting of graces in men, upon the revelation of
<PB N="6" REF="040455_0005_101645D3C0FB01D0"/>
Christ in the soul, which I may afterwards observe in the sequel, and in which sense some interpreters understand it▪ yet I take it mainly to import <HI>the happy meeting of perfections in God to be glorified in the sinner's salvation by Jesus Christ,</HI> which is a gloss that no interpreter I have had occasion to consult does neglect or omit; and, if any of them should miss it, I think they would miss the very ground-work and founda∣tion of all other happy meetings: <HI>Mercy and truth are met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</HI></P>
<P>In the words you may observe, 1<HI>st,</HI> The <HI>members</HI> of the meeting. 2<HI>dly,</HI> the <HI>manner</HI> of the meeting. 3<HI>dly,</HI> the <HI>har∣mony</HI> of the meeting. 4<HI>thly,</HI> The <HI>strangeness</HI> of it.</P>
<P>Observe, I say, 1. The <HI>members</HI> of the meeting, <HI>mercy, truth, righteousness, peace.</HI> I hope I need not caution some in this assembly that they beware of imagining these various perfections of God, under the names of <HI>mercy, truth, righte∣ousness</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> as if they were really distinct and different things in God; or, as if they were really different parties, making a formal consultation, in order, to their agreement; <HI>For God is one,</HI> and cannot be divided; <HI>he is one infinite, eternal and unchangeable Being</HI>; there are not distinct and different things in his nature and essence, however his per∣fections be thus represented to our weak, finite capacities, which cannot understand the perfections of God but in several parts, as it were. By <HI>mercy</HI> then, here, we are to un∣derstand God himself, as he is a <HI>merciful and a gracious God:</HI> By <HI>truth</HI> we are to understand <HI>the same God,</HI> as he is a <HI>true and faithful God:</HI> By <HI>righteousness</HI> we may understand his <HI>justice,</HI> or God himself, as he is a <HI>just and righteous God</HI>; and, by <HI>peace,</HI> the same God, as he is the <HI>God of peace,</HI> and a <HI>God reconciling the world to himself.</HI> So that the whole comes to this; it is the great and eternal God himself, consulting with himself, in a manner becom∣ing his infinite and adorable perfections, how to glorify him∣self in all his glorious attributes in the way of saving sinners in and by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="040455_0006_101645D554286680"/>2. The <HI>manner</HI> of the meeting. These excellencies and perfections of God meet together, as it were, in pairs; <HI>mercy and truth, righteousness and peace,</HI> going hand in hand into the council-chamber, to concert the matters that concerned their highest glory and honour.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>harmony</HI> of the meeting. Having met together, they <HI>kiss and embrace each other. Mercy and peace,</HI> as it were, ex∣press their complacency in <HI>truth and righteousness,</HI> and <HI>truth and righteousness</HI> express their complacency in <HI>mercy and peace,</HI> and delight in one another's honour: For not one attribute of the divine majesty can or will be glorified to the dishon<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> or any other attribute, but mutually embrace each other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the their everlasting arms, for supporting the honour of each <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ther's excellency with complicated ineffable endearment.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>strangeness</HI> and remarkableness of this meeting? For the agreement of these parties met together is the more remarkable, in regard of their jarring and opposite claims: For that <HI>mercy and peace shall meet together,</HI> and agree in fa∣vour to save us, and that <HI>truth and righteousness</HI> should meet together, and agree in justice to destroy us, were not so strange and remarkable. And, if they had kept separate and remain'd so, man had been for ever separate from God, and some darling attributes had never been glorified in man's salvation, our sin and rebellion having in a manner set the attributes of God at such variance, as nothing else than in∣finite wisdom could provide a sufficient answer to all their contradictory claims and interests, which behoved to be done ere the proposal concerning the salvation of any sinner could be gone into. Why, says <HI>mercy,</HI> it is my interest that the sinner live and not perish, that I may be magnified, since I have said, that <HI>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</HI> Well, but, says <HI>truth,</HI> it is my interest as a God of truth that the sinner die, since I have said, that <HI>the soul that sinneth shall die.</HI> Yea, and says <HI>righteousness,</HI> I must join with <HI>truth,</HI> and claim the sinner's damnation for the advancement of my
<PB N="8" REF="040455_0007_101645D71BDC5AD0"/>
interest and honour; for I have said, and will not gain say it, that I <HI>will by no means clear the guilty.</HI> O but, says <HI>peace.</HI> I must join in with <HI>mercy,</HI> and claim the sinner's salvation, for advancing my interest; for I <HI>create the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is afar off, and to him that is near.</HI> So there appears to be a war in heaven among these infinitely adora∣ble attributes and perfections, while <HI>mercy and peace</HI> are say∣ing, we must have glory in shewing undeserved pity on the sinner, and yet <HI>truth and righteousness</HI> are saying, we must <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve glory in executing the deserved vengeance. And now, men and angels! pray tell us, can these <HI>antipodes</HI> meet <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ther? Can these jarring-like attributes of the divine majesty embrace each other in the salvation of the sinner, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as to get all their demands answered, and their different interests advanced? What say you, children of men, can you devise how these differences can be composed for your own safety? No, no; <HI>human</HI> Wisdom says, <HI>It is not in me.</HI> What say ye, angels, that <HI>excel</HI> in <HI>strength</HI> and wisdom? Can you contrive the reconciliation of these irreconcileable demands? No, no; <HI>angelical</HI> wisdom says, <HI>It is not in me.</HI> Well, since creature wisdom fails, may we address the infi∣nite wisdom of the Deity, and enquire at a higher hand? <HI>Be∣hold, now we have taken upon us to speak unto the Lord, who are but dust and ashes</HI>: What sayst thou, O infinitely wise Jehovah? Can these opposite claims be reconciled, to the satisfaction of all parties, and the salvation of the sinner? Yea, it is done, <HI>it is done in a crucified Christ,</HI> whom we have been remembring at this solemnity; and therefore we may sing this marvellous song upon an after review of it, saying, <HI>Glory, glory, glory to God, that mercy and truth are met to∣gether,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>OBSERVATION. <HI>That in the salvation of sinners by Jesus Christ the glorious attributes and perfections of God do harma∣niously conspire and embrace one another.</HI> Or thus, <HI>That in Christ crucified for the Redemption of sinners, all the glorious
<PB N="9" REF="040455_0008_101645D9260A8298"/>
attributes of the divine Majesty do harmoniously conspire, and embrace one another.</HI></P>
<P>When God is well pleased, no perfection of God is dis∣pleased; <HI>but God is well pleased in Christ</HI>: And therefore every perfection of his nature is well pleased, none of them displeased or dissatisfied, but all pleased and satisfied to the full. See <HI>Hos.</HI> 2.19, 20. This is declared by an audible voice from heaven, saying, <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,</HI> Mat. 3. last. And why? Even for the reason you have, <HI>Isa.</HI> 42.21. We see <HI>he hath brought in a righteousness</HI> answering the demands of all that stood in the way of our salvation: Did divine <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> say, that the threatning of the law must be executed, so sure as God is true, as well as its precept obtemperated and obeyed? Well, can a righteousness, satisfying both these demands, do the business? Yea, says <HI>justice</HI> itself, in concert with <HI>mercy,</HI> if there be but one righteous man in the <HI>Sodom</HI> of this earth, that can satisfy my broken and violated law, in its command of perfect obedience, and in its demand of complete satisfac∣tion; then I will spare all the elect world, for the sake of that one righteous man, and, <HI>By his knowledge shall my righ∣teous servant justify many.</HI> Well, says <HI>mercy,</HI> here is one whose name is <HI>wonderful,</HI> and whom they call <HI>Immanuel,</HI> God-man, who hath <HI>brought in an everlasting righteousness,</HI> both active and passive, suiting the precept and penalty of the law: Why then, might one attribute say to another, we are all pleased, and with one consent let it be proclaimed on earth, that <HI>the Lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake; for he hath magnified the law, and made it honourable.</HI> And now the great affair of man's salvation is so well concerted and contrived, that God may have mercy upon them, and be at peace with poor sinners, without any wrong to his truth and righteousness: The attributes of God have met and agreed, and sealed their agreement with a kiss of infinite
<PB N="10" REF="040455_0009_101645DAE294BCC8"/>
kindness, harmony and satisfaction; <HI>Mercy and truth have met together, righteousness &amp; peace have kissed each other.</HI></P>
<P>Now, that I may speak to this Purpose a little more fully, the method I propose is,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To touch a little at this question, who are the <HI>members</HI> of this meeting? Or, what are these <HI>attributes of God,</HI> which do thus harmoniously conspire together, proposing their va∣rious claims?</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I would enquire, <HI>when,</HI> and <HI>where</HI> it is that <HI>they meet to∣gether,</HI> and embrace one another?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>How,</HI> and after what <HI>manner</HI> it is, <HI>that they meet toge∣ther,</HI> and kiss one another?</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Why,</HI> or for what <HI>reason</HI> it is that they have met toge∣ther thus harmoniously?</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Make some <HI>application.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I would speak a little of the <HI>members</HI> of this meeting, or the attributes of God that thus harmoniously conspire to∣gether. We need not ask, at whose <HI>instance</HI> this meeting is called? It is at the instant, and by the order of JEHOVAH, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, one God; his sovereign will and pleasure resolving, in a manner like himself, to concert with himself. Neither need we ask, what is <HI>the occasion</HI> of the meeting? Why, man had sinned, and all mankind, by their sin, was involved under the curse of the law, and wrath of God; and yet God had resolved and decreed, for the glory of his grace and mercy, to save a world of sinners, <HI>elect ac∣cording to the foreknowledge of God.</HI> And while <HI>grace mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> are upon this loving design of saving sinners, it was fit that <HI>justice, truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> should be called into the same council, to appear for their interest; since the proposal of such a salvation of sinners seem to encroach upon their honour, which required the vengeance due to be executed upon the <HI>sinner.</HI> Well, the meeting being called, these glorious perfections, <HI>mercy, truth, righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> ap∣pear; <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> full of pity, <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>justice</HI> full of fury, which made a seeming controversy in heaven. We
<PB N="11" REF="040455_0010_101645DF26C0FD70"/>
may suppose <HI>Adam arraigned in the name of all mankind, and standing as a trembling prisoner at the bar</HI>; yea, his very tongue chained up in silence, by reason of sin and guilt, and he sentenced to eternal death, and ready to have the sentence executed upon him and all his posterity. We may suppose, next, <HI>the several members of the meeting opening the assembly,</HI> by putting in their several claims; and we may observe them in the order of the text.</P>
<P N="1">1. MERCY, being full of pity towards the miserable, comes walking along <HI>in the cool of the evening,</HI> and meekly craving leave to speak, notwithstanding that <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>justice</HI> be present at the meeting: <HI>It is true,</HI> says MERCY, <HI>That man hath sinned, and just that man shall die; but art not thou, O Lord, full of pity and compassion, the Lord, the Lord God, pardoning iniquity transgression and sin? What tho' man hath sinned and is all over be smeared with mire and blood? yet look upon him in love, and destroy not the work of thy own hand; he was made a child after thy own image: Tho' now his garment be rent and all bloody, yet see, is not this thy son's coat?</HI> JOSEPH <HI>is gone, and wilt thou lose</HI> BENJAMIN <HI>also? Angels are gone, and shall men be lost also? Miriads of angels are fallen, and that irrecoverably; and shall man peresh also? O spare him! is he not a little one? and his soul shall live. I see,</HI> might MERCY say, <HI>that</HI> TRUTH <HI>and</HI> RIGHTEOUSNESS <HI>or</HI> JUSTICE, <HI>which have the poor sinner in their chains, are here present ready to speak in this assembly for their interest and honour against the criminal: But let it be marked in the minutes of this court, that</HI> MERCY <HI>craves to be magnified and must have honour at this meeting.</HI> Well, MERCY having spoken her mind,</P>
<P N="2">2. TRUTH comes in naked and open-mouthed, <HI>in favour of God's faithfulness,</HI> and in opposition to man's perfidy and treachery, saying, <HI>I have heard what</HI> MERCY <HI>craves in fa∣vour of this criminal; but, O thou faithful and true God, the word is gone out of thy mouth, and there is no revoking of it; thou
<PB N="12" REF="040455_0011_101645E25E8E4FB8"/>
hast said to</HI> Adam, In the day thou eatest thou shalt surely die; <HI>and now he hath eaten, he hath sinned, and shall he not die? What, is there</HI> Yea <HI>and</HI> Nay <HI>with God, who hath faithfulness for the girdle of his loins? Must not God's word of threatning take effect? Yea, heaven and earth shall pass away, but a jot of his word shall not fall to the ground: And therefore, whatever be the demand of</HI> MERCY, <HI>let it be marked in the records of this meeting, that</HI> TRUTH <HI>craves to be magnified; and that it's honour be not infringed in the least, by any claim or plea that</HI> MERCY <HI>had brought in.</HI> Well, TRUTH having spoken, gives way to her sister <HI>justice</HI>; and thereupon,</P>
<P N="3">3. RIGHTEOUSNESS or <HI>justice</HI> comes in, and impleads against the rebel sinner: <HI>Righteousness,</HI> I say, bringing her scales in her hand, in which she had tried him, and found him lighter than vanity itself: <HI>he is weighed in the balances, and found wanting</HI>; yea, not only wanting and destitute of all that perfection and obedience which the law requir'd, but full of all that rebellion which the law discharged, having <HI>sinned and come short of the glory of God</HI>; and so is righteously subjected to the sanction of the law, and sentence of eternal death: And therefore, says RIGHTEOUSNESS,
<Q>O thou infinitely righteous and just judge, MERCY can have no hearing in this court to the prejudice of thy honour and glory, as a just and righteous God. As TRUTH hath pronounced the sentence of wrath &amp; vengeance against sin; so, if thou be a just God, the infinite vengeance due to such an infinite evil must be executed to the full. This criminal is my prisoner, and loosed he shall not be, till I get full satisfaction, and my sword be drunk with blood; for, vengeance is mine, and I will repay it, saith the Lord; and I will by no means clear the guilty: And therefore let it be register'd in this court, that RIGHTEOUSNESS craves to be magnified, &amp; JUSTICE to be glorified in a full satisfaction; and this is claimed and demanded in the name of the righteous and just judge of the universe; and
<PB N="13" REF="040455_0012_101645E4D8259848"/>
shall not the judge of all the earth do right?</Q>
Here is the language of <HI>justice.</HI> What then? O! shall the demand of <HI>mercy</HI> be utterly run down by these powerful opposing pleas of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI>? Is there no friends in this court to take <HI>mercy</HI>'s part? Yea, there is: Therefore,</P>
<P N="4">4. PEACE immediately steps in with an olive-branch in her hand saying,
<Q>Fury is not in me; and may I speak a word in behalf of forlorn mankind? may I offer a meek answer to the claim of TRUTH and RIGHTEOUSNESS, which they have advanced in opposition to the demand of MERCY? for a soft answer turneth away wrath.</Q>
Well, PEACE being allowed a hearing, proposes a healing overture saying,
<Q>O thou God of peace, may not an atonement be made, a reconciliation thought of betwixt thy Majesty and and thy creature? May not one befound out to stand in the gap, and bear off this wrath, to become surety for the great debtor, to acquit and liberate this poor miserable pri∣soner and criminal? May not one be found out that will make up the breach, by vindicating the honour of TRUTH and satisfying the demands of JUSTICE, and so making way for the claim of MERCY; and then all differences may be peaceably composed, so as we may harmoniously agree and kiss one another? O! may not then a peace∣maker be found out, in whom we may find all our demands satisfied at once, without prejudging one another; why, if such an one can be found, surely his name shall be called wonderfull, counsellor, the prince of peace.</Q>
Well, the overture and proposal of <HI>peace</HI> being recorded amonst the rest of the archives of the glorious court; and it being such a peaceable overture, no members of the meeting could dis∣prove it: But the great Question then is, how it could be effectuate: For, if one man sin against another, a man might determine; but, if a man sin against <HI>Jehovah,</HI> who shall in∣treat for him? For when an infinite majesty is offended, who among <HI>finite creatures</HI> is able to satisfy it, or,
<Q>What can coun∣tervail
<PB N="14" REF="040455_0013_101645E65D69D0D0"/>
the king's loss? Wherewith <HI>then</HI> shall <HI>he</HI> come be∣fore the Lord, or bow <HI>himself</HI> before the most high God? Will thousands of rams <HI>do it,</HI> or ten thousands rivers of oil, or the fruit of the body for the sin of the soul? <HI>No, no</HI>; sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not; <HI>for</HI> it is impossible that the blood of bulls or of goats should take away sin;</Q>
Heb. 10.5. What then, will angels become surety for the sin of man? No, no; tho' they had a will, they have not power, they have but oil enough in their vessels for their own lamps. What then shall be done? Why, might <HI>Peace</HI> say, let us not stand in a demur; we have infinite <HI>Wisdom</HI> here present with us at this meeting, let us hear her judgment concerning this peaceable proposal, if it be possible that such a person can be found in whom we may harmoniously centre at last. Then WISDOM sits down upon the privy-council bench, &amp;, being full of eyes, does gravely determine this doubtful <HI>case</HI> with a happy issue:
<Q>It is expedient, says WISDOM, that one die for the people, that the whole na∣tion of mankind perish not; but he must be such a righte∣ous one, that can justify many; yea, he that will under∣take this, must be finite, that he may die; and infinite, that he may conquer death, and satisfy infinite justice: But lo, there is no such to be found among all the creatures that ever God made, neither can such an one be found, unless the Son of God himself, the second person of the glorious Trinity, shall be pleased, by an unspeakable mys∣tery, to become flesh, made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that are under the Law, that they may receive the adoption of sons, Gal. 4.4. <HI>That so, when he, that hath no sin, shall become sin for man; man who hath no righteousness, may become the righteousness of God through him,</HI> 2 Cor. 5. last: <HI>And thus</HI> MERCY <HI>may be mag∣nified,</HI> TRUTH <HI>justified,</HI> RIGHTEOUSNESS <HI>cleared,</HI> JUSTICE <HI>satisfyed,</HI> PEACE <HI>concluded, &amp; all contented.</HI></Q>

all parties hearkned, as it were, with pleasure, and willingly subscribed to the happy overture; and then heaven and earth conspired together in solemn thanksgiving, saying, <HI>Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, and good will to∣wards men.</HI> Thus the jarring attributes of God are now re∣conciled; and behold, the members of the meeting, that seemed to be at the greatest variance, are embracing one a∣nother in their Arms; <HI>Mercy and truth are met together,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The <HI>second</HI> thing was, <HI>when</HI> and <HI>where</HI> did these blessed parties meet together? When we speak of a remarkable meeting, it is usual to enquire into the time and place of the meeting. Now, the <HI>place</HI> where, and the <HI>time</HI> when, as to this wonderful meeting, are two questions, which I put to∣gether; for they may both be answered at once, because of their near relation.</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> Then, in general, the <HI>meeting-place,</HI> or the place of meeting, is CHRIST; and the time of the meeting was when Christ put himself in our room, or substitute himself in the place of the sinner, to answer all the demands of all the mem∣bers of the meeting, who had any objection against our sal∣vation, or any thing to lay to our charge. Where then, and when did they <HI>meet together and kiss each other</HI>? Why, it was even in Christ, when he took our law-room, to pay our debt, and purchase our liberty in such a manner as <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> might have their interests advanced, without injury to <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI>; that <HI>mercy</HI> might have vent to the credit of <HI>truth,</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> might be proclaimed to the ho∣nour of <HI>righteousness,</HI> and the sinner saved to the satisfaction of <HI>justice.</HI> They meet together and embrace each other in him as the surety, <HI>the surety of the better testament,</HI> Heb. 7.22. We were <HI>debtors</HI> to the mandatory and minatory part of the law, arraigned at the instance of divine <HI>justice</HI> to pay the debt; Christ substitutes himself in our room, and comes un∣der the law to pay the whole debt. It is true, the debt was personal, and <HI>justice</HI> had a demand upon the person that sin∣ned
<PB N="16" REF="040455_0015_101645EC5AA78450"/>
by virtue of the covenant of works; but that covenant never excluded a surety, tho' it provided none. The law promised life, upon our personal obedience; but, in case we fail, it revealed no surety to make out an obedience in our room. There behoved indeed to be a secret reserve in the covenant of works, whereby the perfect obedience of another was not excluded: For, if the covenant of works had abso∣lutely excluded a surety in our room, then the covenant of grace had been excluded, and our salvation had been impos∣sible after our fall; but tho' the covenant of works did not exclude a surety, yet that covenant did neither provide nor reveal a surety: This is done in the covenant of grace, which is Christ as surety fulfilling for us the covenant of works, in all the articles of it. Now, is truth and faithfulness at any loss here? No, the truth of the promise &amp; threatning both of the law of works, is fulfilled. On the one hand, the promise of eternal life made to perfect obedience; which, tho' we forfeited in our own person, yet we recover in the person of Christ; the promise of life upon the ground and condition of perfect obedience being fulfilled to us in him, who hath yielded that perfect obedience in our room: On the other hand, divine <HI>truth</HI> and faithfulness, in the threatning of the law, which was death, is glorified, in that it is fulfilled upon the surety; while we, who came under the sentence of death in the first <HI>Adam,</HI> undergo that death in the second. Again, is <HI>righteousness</HI> and <HI>justice</HI> at any loss by this surety in our room? No, no; whether we look upon it as vindictive or retributive justice, vindictive justice is displayed in its utmost severity upon Christ; <HI>Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and the man that is my fellow</HI>: And so the sword is drunk in his blood to infinite satisfaction. Retributive justice is glori∣ously displayed also, in the sinner's being rewarded, justified, saved upon this ground. It is true, might JUSTICE say,
<Q>I could have demanded satisfaction upon the sinner himself in his own person; but, as I can sustain no injury to my
<PB N="17" REF="040455_0016_101645EF04B21278"/>
honour by such a surety as this, whom they call EMMANUEL' God-man, so I find my honour &amp; interest, instead of being impaired, is advanced by this exchange of persons: For, tho' I should damn the sinner to all eternity, I'll never get such full and compleat satisfaction upon any finite crea∣ture, as I will get by one stroke of my avenging sword upon that person of infinite dignity; and so it pleased the Lord to bruise him.</Q>
Why then, they meet together and em∣brace one another in him, as a surety; and, if <HI>truth</HI> &amp; <HI>righte∣teousness</HI> be both pleased to the full, the parties cannot but all agree &amp; embrace each other. Again they meet together and embrace one another in him, as a sacrifice <HI>a sacrifice &amp; offering of a sweet-smelling favour unto God,</HI> Eph. 5.2. Why <HI>he offered up himself by the eternal Spirit.</HI> O great! Even by his eternal Godhead; a valuable sacrifice indeed! They meet together in him, as a propitiation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.25. <HI>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness,</HI> &amp;c. Behold him righteous in shewing mercy; here is the atonement, the propitiation, that very word which the <HI>septuagint</HI> calls the <HI>mercy-seat</HI> in the old testament; and it is the word that the poor publican made use of, when he was seeking mercy, saying, <HI>God be merciful to me a sinner.</HI> He remembred this mercy-seat and propitiation. It is not sim∣ple mercy that he sought, but mercy through a propitiation; he looked to the blood of atonement, to the sacrificed lamb of God, saying, Give me mercy for this; by that solemn pro∣pitiation be thou propitious to me. Here it is, that <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>justice</HI> meet together. They meet together in him, as a ransom, <HI>Job</HI> 33.24. <HI>Deliver his soul from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom.</HI> In a word they have met toge∣ther, and kissed one another in a crucified Christ, whose death was the payment of our debt, the punishment of our sin, the price of our redemption, and a purchase of our life, liberty and eternal salvation. Here is the meeting-place then of these glorious perfections of God; here is the person in whom
<PB N="18" REF="040455_0017_101645F17397D320"/>
they centre, that they may be all glorified to the highest: <HI>Mercy, truth, righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> all are pleased. <HI>Mercy</HI> is gra∣tified, and constitutes him to be the mercy-seat; <HI>truth</HI> is sa∣tisfied, and centers in him as the <HI>way, the truth and the life; righteousness</HI> is contented, and declares him to be the <HI>Lord our righteousness; peace</HI> is pacified, &amp; proclaims him to be the <HI>prince of peace.</HI> Yea, not only are all the members of the meet∣ing pleased and satisfied for themselves, in the advancement of their own particular interest, but they are infinitely well pleased in each other, and that the interests of their seemingly opposite parties are advanced, as well as their own par∣ticular claims: <HI>Mercy</HI> is pleased that truth hath got all its de∣mands, and truth is pleased that <HI>mercy</HI> hath got all her desire, and <HI>righteousness</HI> is pleased that peace is proclaimed, and peace is pleased that <HI>righteousness</HI> is honoured. <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> rejoice that they are magnified to the infinite glory of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness,</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> rejoice that they are glorified to the infinite pleasure of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI>: and hence they not only meet together, but kiss one another. Here you see where they meet together: So much for an answer thereto more generally.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> More particularly, as to the <HI>meeting-time,</HI> you may take these <HI>following paticulars</HI> for the further clearing of it. Altho' this <HI>blessed meeting</HI> once taking place is still continued, and cannot be said properly to adjourn from <HI>time</HI> to <HI>time,</HI> and from <HI>place</HI> to <HI>place</HI>; for this assembly never dissolves: Yet, in a suitableness to our weak capacity and finite under∣standing, which cannot rightly conceive of a meeting that never had a time to meet, because they met in eternity, and never shall have a time to part, because they meet to eter∣nity; we cannot conceive of it, I say, but by taking it, as it were, into so many parts, or considering it in so many peri∣ods: And there are these eight remarkable periods: where∣in <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> meet with <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness,</HI> and kiss each other.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="19" REF="040455_0018_101645F4C91B7B60"/>1. The first remarkable period is this, they meet together at the council-table of the <HI>covenant of redemption</HI> from all eternity, before ever the foundation of the world was laid; and ere ever the morning-stars sang together, <HI>mercy and truth met together, righteousness and peace kissed each other</HI>: For the council of peace did then meet, <HI>Zech.</HI> 6.13. and all was con∣certed by infinite wisdom, how <HI>mercy</HI> should be magnified, <HI>truth</HI> cleared, <HI>righteousness</HI> vindicated, &amp; <HI>peace</HI> concluded, and all in Christ, who according to the tenor of that covenant (whereof the covenant of grace is but a transcript) was to give <HI>his soul an offering for sin,</HI> &amp; then was to <HI>set his seed,</HI> &amp; <HI>the pleasure of the Lord</HI> to <HI>prosper in his hand.</HI> Then it was that this pleasant meeting in him was first constituted, as you may see, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.30.31. <HI>He</HI> being <HI>set up from everlasting; ere ever the earth was,</HI> God in all his glorious perfections was delighted in him, and in him his <HI>delights were with the sons of men.</HI> This was the grand meeting, at which the time and place of all the subsequent meetings were concerted, and all the other par∣ticulars we are to mention are but the result of this, and as it were emanations therefrom, for it is a meeting that ne∣ver dissolves, tho' in several periods it appears like a new meeting unto us. Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. Another remarkable period is their meeting together in the garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> after man had made himself naked and obnoxious to the flaming sword of divine justice. Mercy comes walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the guilty criminal being examined in open court, behold <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> meet together in the happy sentence that was pro∣nounced, <HI>The seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent,</HI> Gen. 3.15. Behold <HI>righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> kissing one another in the righteous vengeance that was to be exe∣cuted upon the devil and his works, in order to effectuate a happy peace betwixt God and man. This meeting was gra∣dually cleared up under the old testament, and in the legal sacrifices, pointing out the great propitiatory sacrifice.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="20" REF="040455_0019_101645F668B9E358"/>3. Another remarkable period is their meeting together at <HI>Bethlehem Ephratah,</HI> upon Christ's Incarnation, <HI>Micah</HI> 5.2, 4, 5, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Another remarkable period is their meeting together at the banks of <HI>Jordan,</HI> when Christ was baptized, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.13, 16, 17, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Another remarkable period is their meeting together in the garden of <HI>Gethsemane,</HI> when Christ, <HI>being in an agony, did sweat great drops of blood,</HI> under the pressure of avenging justice; every drop of blood was an ocean of mercy: And, while he was prest in the wine-press of God's wrath, <HI>mercy</HI> was exprest. No mercy to Christ; for <HI>God spared not his own for,</HI> even when he cried, mercy, mercy, God's mercy; saying, <HI>Father, if it be thy will remove this cup from me.</HI> No, no, no mercy was shewn to him, otherwise no mercy had been shown to us: Justice must have its due from him, that mer∣cy might have vent towards us; and so here <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> meet together.</P>
<P N="6">6. Another remarkable period is their meeting on mount <HI>Calvary,</HI> where Christ was crucified. It was upon the cross of Christ that <HI>mercy and truth meet together,</HI> that <HI>righteousness and peace kissed each other</HI>; for there it was that he paid all the elect's debt to the last farthing that truth and righteous∣ness could demand, until <HI>he cried with a loud voice, and said, It is finished.</HI> Having done all that the law could injoin, he suffered all that the law could threaten, so as it cannot crave a farthing more. It is finished; all that was stipulated for with the Father in that federal transaction; all that was pro∣mised in that eternal compact is finished; every article a∣greed to in the counsel of peace was finished. The bargain that he had signed with his hand, he now sealed with his blood; and in his appearance upon the cross, or in his obe∣dience to the death, did all the attributes of God meet, as in a centre: And on this account was mount <HI>Calvary</HI> more glorious than mount <HI>Sinai</HI>; for in mount <HI>Sinai</HI> God appeared
<PB N="21" REF="040455_0020_101645F858E72EE0"/>
in his terrible majesty, making the mountain to tremble, and the earth to shake; but here in mount <HI>Calvary</HI> he appeared, not only in his terrible majesty, but in his tender mercy; in his terrible fury against sin, &amp; in his tender favour towards the sin∣ner; &amp; now, the controversy betwixt <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> seems at a crisis. Here was the critical juncture, wherein their dif∣ferent demands behoved to be decided; and it was done with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> solemnity, as made the whole universe, as it were to tremble and quake: For then did God <HI>shake, not the earth only, but also heaven</HI>; for, when Christ was under the mighty load of this terrible wrath in the sinner's room, there was a great earthquake, and the heavens grew black, the sun was eclipsed, and that at a time contrary to the com∣mon rules of nature; which made a heathen philosopher, at a distance, cry out, <HI>That either the frame of nature was on the point of dissolution, or the God of nature was suffering</HI>: And indeed he was suffering unto blood, and unto death. Be∣hold the living and eternal God here, in our nature, wounded to death and bleeding out his life, to be a sacrifice for sin, that justice might be satisfied, and mercy might be magni∣fied, and all the attributes of God glorified to the highest. O wonder, that <HI>Golgotha,</HI> the place of a scull, should be such a famous meeting-place for the divine perfections? It was a place of the greatest shame and ignominy; but in him <HI>who endured the cross, and despised the shame,</HI> it was made a place of most resplendent glory: For, in the cross of Christ, <HI>mercy and truth, righteousness and peace met and embraced each other.</HI> God's attributes did harmoniously join together, so as the one does not blacken, but illustrate the glory of the other, while they shined gloriously in the face of Christ crucified, as a beautiful and bright constellation; for he was <HI>set forth to be a propitiation, to declare the righteousness</HI> and justice of God, together with his other glorious names.</P>
<P N="7">7. Another remarkable period is there meeting together at the bar of God's great justice-court in heaven, <HI>within the
<PB N="22" REF="040455_0021_101645FD03364BD0"/>
vail, whither the forerunner hath for us entred, even Jesus,</HI> Heb. 6. <HI>last.</HI> When Christ was upon the cross, <HI>the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom,</HI> &amp; a way was made for entring into the holy of holies. And as the priests under the law were not only to offer the sacrifice without the camp, but after that were to enter the holiest of all, not with∣out blood, but with the blood of the sacrifice, <HI>to sprinkle the mercy seat,</HI> Lev. 16.14, 15. Even so <HI>Christ, having offered himself a sacrifice, and suffered without the gate,</HI> Heb. 13.12. <HI>He is entred into the holy place by his own Blood,</HI> Heb. 9.12. there to appear as our high priest, in the power and virtue of his blood, to make a full atonement, and sprinkle the mercy-seat. Hence believers are said <HI>to be come to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling.</HI> And where is this? Even in heaven, as you see in the context, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.23, 24. Now, in this work, Christ carried the price of his blood into the very presence of God for us, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.24. and paid it down before him; and, in this act, justice hath its satisfaction brought home; and, by this act, mercy and justice actually are met: For hereby Christ sprinkled the very mer∣cy-seat with blood all over, both <HI>upon</HI> it, and <HI>before</HI> it, as the forecited <HI>Lev.</HI> 16. represents: For the mercy-seat of old stood so, that it could be seen but two ways, namely, upon it, and before it, as a table next to the wall; and so this points out, that whatever way we look to mercy by faith, we may see mercy and blood mixt, mercy and justice met together, and all sorts of mercy conveyed thro' the blood of Christ, top-mercies, and side-mercies, upper-mercies of a spiritual nature, and lower mercies of a temporal nature; for the mercy-seat is sprinkled with the blood upon it, and be∣fore it, and whatever way you look to it. The sacrifice was finished on the cross, and all sacrifices finished therein; but the blood of the sacrifice behoved also to be carried within the vail in order to the full atonement, that what was writ∣ten in blood upon the cross, might be sealed in the presence
<PB N="23" REF="040455_0022_101645FFAC4F7D98"/>
of God at the heavenly bar: And we act not our faith far enough for redemption, unless we follow Christ from the cross to the bar of God's justice-court in heaven, to see all sealed and secured there within the vail, where this blood is exposed, as it were, and pled at the bar; where <HI>mercy and justice meet together, and embrace each other.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Another remarkable period is their meeting together at the bar of conscience, God's lower court, on the day of actual reconciliation betwixt God and the sinner: For then, <HI>the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit did offer him∣self without spot to God, doth purge the conscience,</HI> Heb. 9.14. And <HI>the blood of sprinkling, wherewith the conscience is purged from dead works to serve the living God,</HI> doth put forth it's purgative power and virtue by a certain internal speech; and what doth it speak in the conscience? <HI>It speaks better things than the blood of</HI> Abel; that speaks <HI>vengeance,</HI> but this speaks <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> in conjunction with <HI>truth, righteousness</HI> and <HI>justice</HI>: For, wherever justice satisfying blood cries for mercy and peace, there <HI>mercy and truth, righteousness and peace meet, and embrace each other.</HI> This blood is the cement whereby they are joined together. Before this blood be applied, the conscience of the convinced sinner is all in a flame, like mount <HI>Sinai</HI>; thunder and lightning, and smoak and darkness, and fear of hell and vengeance, compassing the soul about, while it is arraigned at the instance of the fiery law, to pay the double debt to the mandatory &amp; minotary part of the law, that is, perfect obedience upon the pain of eternal death and damnation. The sinner finds himself lost and un∣done for ever by this law: But then, whenever the blood of sprinkling comes in, and appears at the bar of conscience, it speaks better things; it is a better speaker than the law: And what says it? Why, the language of it is, By your leave, O <HI>law,</HI> you have nothing to crave; for Christ the Son of God was arraigned at the instance of divine justice, to pay
<PB N="24" REF="040455_0023_101646032F334080"/>
all this debt, because he was this sinner's surety and substi∣tute; and he actually paid it, by obeying the command, and undergoing the penalty of the law: And for this I produce the ancient records of God; <HI>In the volume of</HI> his <HI>book it is written of</HI> Christ, that <HI>when sacrifice and offering would not, he said, Lo, I come, I delight to do thy will</HI>; and that <HI>the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all</HI>; That <HI>he was made a curse for us</HI>; yea, that <HI>he was made sin for us,</HI> even he <HI>who knew no sin, that we might become the righteousness of God in him:</HI> And therefore, O <HI>law,</HI> tho' thou hast <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righ∣teousness</HI> on thy side, yet <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> have met with <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> and they have concerted matters, and agreed harmoniously, and kiss'd one another, in token of their full agreement in Christ; so that in Christ all charges are answered, and thus in the believer's conscience parties meet together.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>third</HI> thing proposed was <HI>how,</HI> and after what <HI>manner</HI> is it that they meet together, and kiss each other? We are to conceive of it after the manner of God; for it is more than a meeting of saints, it is more than a meeting of angels, it is a divine meeting of all the glorious attributes of God; And we may observe these following qualities of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a <HI>wonderful</HI> and <HI>mysterious</HI> meeting, it is above our comprehension and conception; O how wonderful a meet∣ing is this! The very <HI>name</HI> of the person, which is made the place of appointment, the meeting place, is called <HI>wonderful!</HI> Isa. 9.6. Because the meeting is about us, <HI>his name is called</HI> Immanuel, <HI>God with us.</HI> O how mysterious is this meeting, <HI>Great is the mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh,</HI> 1 Tim. 3.16. that is, all the attributes of God meeting to∣gether, and harmoniously embracing one another in the e∣ternal Son of God, who hath assumed our nature into his own personality; this is the most wonderful mysterious meet∣ing that ever was in heaven or earth.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a <HI>joyful</HI> meeting, they meet with infinite pleasure
<PB N="25" REF="040455_0024_10164607619FFC88"/>
and satisfaction in one another; <HI>Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth,</HI> Isa. 42.1. As the perfections of God are glorified in Christ, so they rejoice and are delighted in him: <HI>For</HI> Jehovah <HI>is well pleased for his righteousness sake</HI>; and therefore <HI>the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand,</HI> and <HI>he shall see the travail of his soul, and be satisfied.</HI> Surely, if God hath his pleasure, and Christ his satisfaction, no attribute of the divine majesty, no member of the meeting is displeased or out of humour; no, no: <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</HI> My justice is pleased, my mercy is pleased, and all my other attributes are pleased. O it is an exceeding pleasant and joyful meeting! May all that hear me be well pleased to see it; no joyful meeting, but what hath a respect to this.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is a <HI>holy</HI> meeting. Some meetings among men, that are called joyful meetings, yet are very unholy and sinful meetings; but here is an infinitely holy meeting: <HI>Holiness to the Lord,</HI> is the motto of it. A meeting of holy saints and holy angels is not such a holy meeting as this meeting of the holy attributes of God, to advance the great design of infi∣nite holiness. All the holy meetings that ever were, or will be, are the result of this, and the effect of some portion of holiness sent from it; for all holiness issues from it. Here <HI>mercy and truth meet together</HI> in a holy manner, <HI>righteousness and peace salute</HI> each other in a holy way, and <HI>greet one ano∣ther with a holy kiss.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. It is a <HI>happy</HI> meeting. All happiness and blessings flow from this meeting; Christ the meeting-place is the centre <HI>of all spiritual blessings,</HI> Eph. 1.3. Many unhappy meetings have been in the world since sin entred into it, and sinful unholy meetings are ever miserable and unhappy meetings; but this holy meeting must be a happy meeting; and this holy kiss must be a happy kiss. If <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> had not met together, we had never met with God; if <HI>righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> had never kissed each other, we had never got a
<PB N="26" REF="040455_0025_10164608E682FE58"/>
kiss of the fair face of the Son of God, nor ever been taken into the divine embraces.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is a <HI>free</HI> meeting. <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> met together freely, without being constrained; <HI>righteousness</HI> &amp; <HI>peace</HI> kissed each other freely, without being forced. No motive from without could ever take place to move God to call this meet∣ing from eternity; it was according to <HI>his own purpose and grace, which is given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</HI> 2 Tim. 1.9. Free sovereign grace is the original of the meeting. It is also such a free assembly, where every mem∣ber might freely speak, and not one to interrupt another, as is usual in meetings among men, where some cry one thing, and some another, in a confused manner, like that assembly, <HI>Acts</HI> 19.32. where it is said, <HI>The assembly was confused, and the greater part knew not wherefore they were met together; and some cried one thing, and some another.</HI> No, this meeting is free, in opposition both to all constraint and compulsion from without, and to all confusion and commotion from within. Where sovereign free grace is the master-convener, there can be no compulsion; and, where the God of order is the great manager, there could be no confusion; and, where the God of peace was all in all, there could be no dissention.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="6">6. It is a <HI>harmonious</HI> meeting. Whatever different claims and pretensions the members of the meeting seem to have, yet they harmoniously concur in advancing one another's honour and glory; and hence, as they mutually met together, so they affectionately embrace one another. There was no discord at this assembly, no proper variance or striving for state, but gloriously conspiring with joint hearts and hands to glorify each other in the salvation of a company of sinners by Jesus Christ. The divine essence is undivided: And, as <HI>there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit; and these three are One</HI>; So the attributes of God, however manifold to our apprehension, yet there is no
<PB N="27" REF="040455_0026_1016460AC26F1BA0"/>
division among them, they are all one, and their conspiring together in Christ, for our redemption, is called <HI>the manifold wisdom of God.</HI> The manifold perfections of God meet to∣gether in one, with one consent, and with one heart. Behold <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>justice</HI> in one another's arms; and so close in the embracement, that they are just one. Tho' it is a fall meet∣ing, and all parties present, yet their is no war, no jar, no dissention, no division, but all harmony and concord, and love and affection; it is the most peaceable meeting that ever was. And yet,</P>
<P N="7">7. It is a <HI>bloody</HI> meeting; and never was, and never will there be, such a bloody meeting in heaven or earth. <HI>The mercy-seat must be sprinkled with blood</HI>; mercy cannot be vented without blood, and truth cannot be cleared without blood, righteousness cannot be vindicated without blood, and peace cannot be purchased without blood; <HI>Without shed∣ding of blood there is no remission,</HI> no mercy to be vented, no peace to be proclaimed; <HI>Christ hath made peace by the blood of his cross,</HI> Col. 1.20. <HI>A bloody husband hast thou been unto me,</HI> said <HI>Zipporah</HI>; but, O how much more may Christ say, a bloody meeting hath this been unto me! <HI>Who is this that cometh from</HI> Edom, <HI>with dyed garments from</HI> Bozrah? <HI>Isa.</HI> 63.1. Why, what is the matter that his garment is dyed with blood? Why? when <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> met together, they press'd to be so near one another in him, that they press'd the blood out of his veins; and so it was a bloody meeting: And, when <HI>righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> kiss'd each other, it behoved to be in Christ; and so the sword of justice behoved to pierce him thro' and thro', that so these sacred lips might meet and kiss each other in his heart; and so it was a bloody kiss. They kiss'd each other with such good will, that Christ was, as it were, bruised betwixt their lips, that the blood might cement and glue them together. One would think, such a bloody kiss would be no pleasant kiss; nay, but <HI>it pleased the
<PB N="28" REF="040455_0027_1016460CA3118230"/>
Father to bruise him.</HI> They met together on a sea of blood: Thus it was a bloody meeting. Again,</P>
<P N="8">8. It is an <HI>efficacious</HI> meeting. Many meet and assemble together, and yet do nothing for their meeting, it is to no effect; but <HI>here mercy and truth meet together</HI> efficaciously, co-operatively: All is done at the meeting that God propos∣ed to be done, and all is done that concerns the glory of God and salvation of men; their meeting together is their working together, and that to perfection; <HI>For God the Lord is a rock, and his work is perfect.</HI> There meeting together is their building together, <HI>Psal.</HI> 89.2, 3. <HI>I have said, mercy shalt be built up for ever: Thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.</HI> There is <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> both building, and the foundation of the building is laid in Christ; <HI>I have made a covenant with my chosen,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="9">9. It is an <HI>unexpected</HI> meeting, it is beyond the expecta∣tion of men and angels. If friends and intimates should meet, and salute one another, it would not be surprizing; but to see opposites, antipodes, and antagonists meet toge∣ther, and embrace each other, this were surprising and unex∣pected: So, to see light and darkness, love and enmity, life and death meeting, how unexpected were that? Thus it is here, <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth, righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> these attributes of God, with respect to us, were opposites and antipodes. The language of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> is death and damna∣tion to the sinner; the language of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> is, life and salvation to the sinner: And, when a sinner finds him∣self pursued to death at the instance of divine justice, and the truth and veracity of a God engaged against him, according to the threatning of the law; O how <HI>unexpected</HI> a rencounter is it, when he finds <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> meeting with <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>truth,</HI> and stopping the pursuit, according to the promise of the gospel, to the credit of the opposite parties, saying, <HI>Deli∣ver his soul from going down to the pit; I have found a ransom,</HI> and so all odds are made even, all opposites reconciled, to the
<PB N="29" REF="040455_0028_10164611EB0D7048"/>
infinite surprise, and beyond the expectation of all created beings! No wonder then, upon this meeting discovered, the poor souls cries, <HI>Is this the manner of men, O Lord? O, who is like unto thee!</HI> Nay <HI>there is none like unto the God of</HI> Jesurun,, <HI>that rides on the heaven for their help, and in his ex∣cellency on the skies.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. It is an <HI>everlasting,</HI> indissolvable meeting. Other meetings will adjourn their meetings from time to time and from place to place; yea, other meetings must part; and, when they part, they may never meet again; and we that are here met, must part, and never all meet again in time; even as some others that met together with us the last year, are away to eternity. But O, this meeting betwixt <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth, righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> is a meeting where there is no parting; the meeting is from everlasting to everlasting: Their meeting together, and kissing each other, is an eter∣nal and unchangeable meeting, and an eternal and unchange∣able kiss; it is every way like God, without beginning, with∣out ending, and without succession. Whatever beginning, issue or increase it hath with respect to its manifestation to us, yet in itself it is still the same in Christ Jesus, who is <HI>the same yesterday, to-day and for ever,</HI> Heb. 13.8. <HI>without any vari∣ableness or shadow of turning.</HI> The meeting never breaks up, it is a continued meeting never to be dissolved, and there they kiss one another to all eternity: <HI>for his mercy endureth for ever, and his righteousness to all generations</HI>; and <HI>because of truth, meekness and righteousness, in his majesty he shall ride prosperously</HI>; and <HI>of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end. I have said, mercy shall be built up for ever</HI>; and I have said, <HI>Truth shall be established in the heavens.</HI> Why, what is the meaning of all these expressions? The language is as if one glorious attribute of God should say to another, O the sin of man sets us all as it were at variance▪ and the whole creation knows not how to reconcile God with himself, if he shall save one sinner; but, behold, we having
<PB N="30" REF="040455_0029_101646136FCD07B0"/>
met together in Christ the righteousness, the ransom, the a∣tonement, the propitiation, having met together, we shall never part again; having embraced one another in behalf of these poor miserable sinners, our arms shall never separate, that are clasped together. <HI>Mercy &amp; truth have met together,</HI> saying, you and I shall never part; <HI>righteousness &amp; peace have kissed each other,</HI> saying, you and I shall never sunder, nor suspend the embracement; neither death nor life, nor hell, nor devils, nor sin itself, shall ever separate us. It is a bargain among us, a divine match; they have met together by an e∣verlasting covenant, sealed the bargain with an everlasting kiss, &amp; cast a knot in an everlasting righteousness, which is the band of the union, even Christ; <HI>for the covenant does stand fast with him,</HI> Psal. 89.28. where you will also see how this everlasting meeting is established in Christ, <HI>ver.</HI> 14. <HI>Justice &amp; judgment are the habitation of thy throne,</HI> or the establishment of thy throne, as it may be rendered; <HI>And mercy and truth shall go before thy face.</HI> And <HI>ver.</HI> 21. <HI>With him my hand shall be established, &amp; my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him.</HI> And, <HI>ver.</HI> 28. <HI>My mercy will I keep for him for ever.</HI> Thus it is an everlasting meeting.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> thing proposed was, <HI>why</HI> or for what <HI>reasons</HI> they have met together, and kissed each other? Why have the prefections of the glorious God conspired so harmoniously, and met together in such a sweet solemnity? Surely such a meeting as this must have noble designs in view; and I'll tell you these four reasons of the meeting, or four things that were to be concerted at this great assembly.</P>
<P N="1">1. They met together, to concert measures for advancing the glory of God to the highest. This parliament of heaven met together upon ways and means, for bringing in the grea∣test revenue of praise and glory to the crown of heaven, to Father, Son and holy Ghost, &amp; all the glorious attributes of this great and eternal God. These attributes conspired har∣moniously to set forth &amp; glorify themselves most illustriously.
<PB N="31" REF="040455_0030_1016461515368EA8"/>
They met together, and kissed one another, that they migh glorify each other. The glory of God, was the first and last end of the meeting: What is the chief end of man, but to glorify God, and enjoy him for ever? And O, what is the chief end of God! It is even to glorify himself in all his per∣fections, and to enjoy himself for ever. And, how does God glorify himself most brightly? It is even in Christ the meet∣ing-place of these perfections, with a view to our redemp∣tion, <HI>To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved,</HI> Eph. 1.6. And how does he enjoy himself most sweetly? It is even in Christ, <HI>Behold mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth. I was daily his delight,</HI> says Christ, <HI>while my delight was with the sons of men,</HI> Prov. 8.30. They met together to put a crown of glory and honour upon each other. <HI>Adam</HI>'s sin and rebellion, and your sin, my friends, and my sin (O that God dishonouring, evil, sin!) which had pulled off that crown of glory as it were, from the head of the great King eternal and immortal, and cast it into the mire, and stained it with filth and dirt: But, behold, these attributes of God meet together to take up the crown, to rub off the dust and dung that sin had cast upon it, and to add some more sparkling jewels to it than ever, &amp; set it upon the head of their sovereign, to the highest praises of his mer∣cy, justice, truth, righteousness and grace, and love, and ho∣liness, and wisdom, and all his other excellencies; that men &amp; angels might sing and say, <HI>Glory to God in the highest,</HI> &amp;c. that all the saints might sing a consort in praise of the meet∣ing betwixt <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth, justice</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> saying, <HI>Psal.</HI> 89.14.
<Q><L>Justice and judgment of thy throne</L>
<L>Shall be the dwelling place:</L>
<L>Mercy accompany'd with truth</L>
<L>Shall go before thy face.</L></Q>
And that every saint might sing the 57th <HI>Psalm</HI> 9th &amp; 10th verses;
<Q><PB N="32" REF="040455_0031_1016461888CE8FF8"/>
<L>I'll praise thee 'mong the people, LORD,</L>
<L>'Mong nations sing will I;</L>
<L>For great to heav'n thy mercy is,</L>
<L>Thy truth doth reach the Sky.</L></Q>
They met together, to put a <HI>crown of glory</HI> upon the head of Christ, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.9. in whom they met. This assembly did convene <HI>for the coronation of the son of God:</HI> For, <HI>he having humbled himself, and become obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, God hath highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name,</HI> Phil. 2.10. <HI>That at the name of</HI> JESUS, <HI>every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</HI> Christ hath glorified the Father, and therefore the Father <HI>glorified him,</HI> Joh. 13.31, 32. <HI>And now is the son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</HI> And, <HI>if God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself. Him that honoureth me, I will honour,</HI> says God. And in whom does this take place to perfection? It is in Christ: God is honoured most highly by him; and therefore he is honoured most highly of God. <HI>Amen, so let it be, and so it shall be.</HI> And therefore it is con∣certed in that meeting, that all the saints shall glorify him; Hence that royal edict comes forth, <HI>He is thy Lord, worship thou him,</HI> Psal. 45.11. And so we find them doing, <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.9. <HI>Thou art worthy to take the book, and open the seals; for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood.</HI> It is concerted in that meeting, that all the angels shall glorify him: Hence that edict comes forth, <HI>Let all the angels of God worship him,</HI> Heb. 1.6. And so we find them doing, <HI>Rev.</HI> 5.11, 12. <HI>I heard a voice of many angels, and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessings.</HI> It is concerted in this meeting, that all the creatures in heaven and earth, sea and land, shall glo∣rify
<PB N="33" REF="040455_0032_101623F8AC2D76A8"/>
him; as we see v. 13. But lest the sinful creatures upon earth, like you and me, should not glorify him, or see his glory, it is concerted in that glorious meeting, that the Holy Ghost, the eternal Spirit, one God equal in power &amp; glory with the Father and the Son, shall be sent down to the earth to glorify him, Joh. 16.14. <HI>He shall glorify me; for he shall receive of mine, and shew it unto you.</HI> O, hath the Spi∣rit of God been shewing any thing of Christ among you this day? Any thing of his grace, fulness, righteousness, so as to glorify him, and make him glorious above all things to you? Why then, we may reckon that you have found something of the saving fruits of this glorious meeting; for the grand design of it was to glorify God in Christ, by the spirit. They met to concert all things relating to the glory of the Father, in the Son, by the Holy Ghost. They met to consult their own glory in Christ, that mercy and truth might be glorified in him.</P>
<P N="2">2. They met together to concert their proper work, in carrying on this great end, of the glory of God, and his per∣fections. They do not meet together to sit idle, and do no∣thing; no, they meet together to concert each of them their proper business: As Christ said to his friends, <HI>Wherefore was it that ye sought me? Wist ye not that I must be about my father's business?</HI> So may I say here, the attributes of God met toge∣ther, that they might go about God's business. What bu∣siness? What work belongs to each of them severally? Why, mercy and truth meet together, that they may be sent upon an ambassy together, <HI>Psal.</HI> 57.3. <HI>God shall send forth his mercy and his truth</HI>; his mercy to give in the promise of the gospel, and his truth to make out the same: Thus mercy and truth meet together, that they may be sent forth upon some gracious expedition, particularly both to be leaders and followers to the remnant, whom God appointed unto life. On the one hand, to be leaders; hence the <HI>Psalmist</HI> cries,
<PB N="34" REF="040455_0033_1016461AED294398"/>
<HI>Psal.</HI> 43.3. O <HI>send forth thy light and thy truth; let them lead me, and bring me to thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacle. Then will I go to the altar of God, to God my exceeding joy.</HI> Behold the wonderful business of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth,</HI> and the work they are sent out upon, even mercifully to lead blind souls to a God in Christ. On the other hand, it is to be, not only leaders, but followers, <HI>Psal.</HI> 23.6. <HI>Surely goodness and mer∣cy shall follow me all the days of my life.</HI> If the child of God, under any temptation, refuse to be led by <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth,</HI> and give up with them as his leaders, yet, for all that, he shall not hinder them to be his followers: He may run out of God's way, but <HI>mercy</HI> will follow and bring him back; and, when <HI>mercy</HI> follows, it is even in company with <HI>truth</HI>: And O, what think you of this wonder! <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> meet together, that they might go forth together, like two pages, to follow you, believer, thro' all the steps of your wil∣derness journey; <HI>goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.</HI> Here is a piece of work, that <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> have met together for, even to be sent forth, as leaders and fol∣lowers of poor elect sinners, till they be out of all hazard, <HI>in</HI> Emmanuel's <HI>land where glory dwells:</HI> See <HI>Psal.</HI> 61.7. But then, as <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> have met together, to pursue their proper work; so <HI>righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> have kissed each o∣ther, for pursuing of theirs. Well, say you, what is the work of <HI>righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace</HI>? You have a word in the last verse of this <HI>Psalm</HI> where our text lies; <HI>righteousness shall go before him, and set us in the way of his steps.</HI> Divine <HI>right∣ousness,</HI> displaying itself in Christ Jesus the sun of righteous∣ness, goes before him to prepare his way, and to bring us to God, and to our duty. And to be sure, whenever <HI>righte∣ousness</HI> goes before, <HI>peace</HI> will follow after: <HI>for the fruit of righteousness is peace,</HI> whether it be imputed or implanted. Here then the work of <HI>righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> kissing each other, is to bring in these blessed effects in their order: We
<PB N="35" REF="040455_0034_1016461D58D63B08"/>
consider them as divine perfections in the text: And, in these effects, <HI>righteousness</HI> leads the van, and <HI>peace</HI> comes up with the rear.</P>
<P N="3">3. These attributes conspire harmoniously, they meet to∣gether, and kiss each other, for this reason, that, by their meeting together, they may concert the dissolving of some unhappy meetings. These opposite-like attributes of God meet together, that some intimates may be separate, and sad and sinful agreements may be broken up. <HI>Isai.</HI> 28 15. there is a sad meeting and agreement we read of; <HI>We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement.</HI> Why? Is not this the case of all men by nature? Yea; but, how is this sad and miserable meeting dissolved? See v. 16. <HI>Be∣hold, I lay in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a tried stone, a pre∣cious corner-stone, a sure foundation: Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet.</HI> Well, when judg∣ment and righteousness mercifully meet in Christ, the sure foundation, what will be the effect? It follows, v. 17, 18. <HI>The hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand.</HI> Whatever sad aspect this scripture may have to the dispisers of Christ, yet it hath a merciful aspect to all the chosen of God, and all that desire to cleave to the Lord Jesus; yea, there is here a foundation of faith laid for all that here the joyful sound, that whatever sinful and miserable meetings and agreements there are betwixt hell and them, betwixt death and them, yet it cannot stand before this glo∣rious meeting, which was designed to break up and dissolve the opposite meetings that stand in a contrariety thereto. There are many black unions which this blessed union does dissolve, and there is no dissolving of them but by this blessed meeting. There is the black union betwixt the sinner and the law, which is the foundation of the black union betwixt the sinner and his sin; For, when the union betwixt him and
<PB N="36" REF="040455_0035_101646201A9F1BF8"/>
the law is dissolved, then the union betwixt him and his sin is dissolved; according to <HI>Rom</HI> 6.14. <HI>Sin shall not have do∣minion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</HI> Now, what is the covenant of grace? Why, <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> meeting together, <HI>righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> kissing each other in Christ Jesus, is the substance, the marrow, the kernel of the covenant of grace; and it is this blessed meeting that dissolves the union betwixt the sinner and the law, and so be∣twixt the sinner and his sin. O view the glorious design of this meeting! They met together, that you might be separ∣ated from your sad associates. By nature you and the devil had met together, and you was a slave to him; and it is the virtue of this meeting in Christ, that dissolves that; <HI>the seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent.</HI> The world and you had met together, and you took pleasure in your wick∣ed companions, or else was wholly drowned in worldly af∣fairs; O it is the faith of this meeting that dissolves that! <HI>This is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith.</HI> The curse of God and you had met together, and you lie under that curse, till, in the faith of this meeting, you shall see, <HI>that Christ hath become a curse for us.</HI> This meeting is designed for the breaking up of all these, and the like unhappy meet∣ings. They met together in a glorious band, to loose all the knots the devil had tied.</P>
<P N="4">4. These glorious attributes of God do conspire harmo∣niously, they meet together and kiss each other, that they might concert and carry on some happy meetings, and make up some blessed matches. These opposite-like attributes harmoniously meet, that opposites and irreconcileable things might meet together harmoniously, and kiss each other, whether real or seeming opposites.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) There are real opposites that meet together harmo∣niously, by virtue of this glorious meeting; particularly these six,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="37" REF="040455_0036_1016462287A46008"/>1. These opposite-like attributes meet together harmoni∣ously that opposite natures might meet together, even that God and man might meet together, and embrace each other. And there are these two meetings betwixt God and man, that were concerted at this meeting: The one is the meet∣ing betwixt God and man, in the hypostatical union of the two natures of Christ, our <HI>Emmanuel God-man</HI> in one person; this is the <HI>great mystery of goodliness, God manifested in the flesh</HI>; and this is the foundation of all other saving and mer∣ciful meetings betwixt God and man: The other is the meeting betwixt God and man, in the spiritual union betwixt Christ and his members, in one mystical person, by the bond of the spirit; <HI>For he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit</HI>; And this union is the foundation of all spiritual communion with God. We were not only at an infinite nature distance from God, as we are creatures; but at an infinite moral distance from him, as we are criminals and sinners: But the attributes of God met together and kiss'd each other in Christ, that God and man might meet together in a close spiritual union, and kiss each other in a sweet spiritual com∣munion: Whatever spiritual communion you have with God, believer, this day, it flows from this glorious meeting of the divine attributes in Christ; and this union and com∣munion is indeed a meeting of opposite natures: God be∣came man, and took on our nature, and he makes us par∣takers of his nature, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. These opposite-like attributes met together, and kiss'd each other, that opposite wills might meet and embrace each other. God's will and ours are opposite; this is indeed a branch of the former, but our wills are the great forts of cor∣rupt nature, that stand out against God and his will: <HI>We are enmity against God, and not subject to the law of God, nei∣ther indeed can be.</HI> Now, how comes the will to be recon∣ciled to God's will? It is only by Christ, in whom the perfec∣tions
<PB N="38" REF="040455_0037_1016462518830E10"/>
of God meet together: <HI>Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. These opposite-like attributes met &amp; kiss'd each other, that opposite persons <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> man and man, that were enemies and haters of one another, might meet toge∣ther; that <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> might meet together, and men at variance with men might meet together: Hence it is said of him, in whom the attributes of God do meet, <HI>He is our peace,</HI> Eph. 2.14. <HI>who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition: Having abolished in his flesh the enmity,</HI> &amp;c. If any thing slay the enmity to God or man, this is it.</P>
<P N="4">4. These opposite-like attributes of God meet and kiss each other, that opposite climates might meet together; I mean, that heaven &amp; earth might meet together, the church militant and the church triumphant. Heaven and earth were at variance by our sin; but now, in Christ, saints in heaven and saints on earth meet together; Hence we are said to be <HI>come to the general assembly and church of the first born that are written in heaven, to the spirits of just men made perfect.</HI> All believers are said to be thus <HI>come to mount</HI> Zion, <HI>the heavenly</HI> Jerusalem, Heb. 12.22. Yea, in Christ, angels in heaven, and men on earth, do meet together: Hence also believers are said to be <HI>come to the innumerable company of an∣gels</HI>; and <HI>the angel of the Lord encamps about them,</HI> &amp;c. Yea, all things in heaven and earth do meet together, and kiss each other in Christ, the meeting-place, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.20. <HI>Having made peace by the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself, whether things in heaven, or things in earth,</HI> Eph. 1.10. See how, upon the back of this meeting in the text, heaven and earth are said to meet together in the fol∣lowing verse; <HI>Truth shall spring out of the earth, and righte∣ousness shall look down from heaven</HI>; which I insist not upon here.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="39" REF="040455_0038_101646277AB47528"/>5. These opposite-like attributes of God meet and kiss each other, that opposite covenants might meet &amp; embrace each other, even the covenant of works, and the covenant of grace, in Christ the meeting place of the divine perfecti∣ons▪ These two covenants do, as it were, join hands and agree. Did the covenant of works command perfect obe∣dience? and, being broken, did it demand complete satis∣faction? Behold, Christ's obedience to the death answers both; God's covenant of grace, dispensed to us, is just Christ fulfilling for us the covenant of works: And so in him they meet, and kiss each other; <HI>For he is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.</HI> Again,</P>
<P N="6">6. These opposite-like attributes of God meet and kiss each other, that opposite tho'ts might meet together, and embrace each other, even God's tho'ts and our tho'ts. How opposite these are, you may see, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.8, 9. <HI>For my tho'ts are not your tho'ts, nor your ways my ways; for, as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thot's than your tho'ts.</HI> Some have presumptuous thot's while they look only to God's mercy, and so they think cer∣tainly God will have mercy upon them, tho' yet they are strangers to Christ; these are opposites to God's tho'ts, he hath no tho'ts of shewing mercy that way. Others have despairing tho'ts, while they look merely or mostly to God's justice, and so their tho't is, O, will God have mercy on such as I am; and, he cannot in justice save such a one as I! These tho'ts are also opposite to God's tho'ts: <HI>My tho'ts are not your tho'ts.</HI> O then, how shall these opposite tho'ts meet together? Why, let a man view the mercy and justice of God met together, and harmoniously kissing each other in Christ, so as to see God in Christ reconciling the world to himself. If your tho'ts be spiritualized, to discern mercy venting itself thro' the sacrifice that satisfies divine justice, then God's thoughts and your thoughts meet together, and
<PB N="40" REF="040455_0039_10164629FAC5C6C0"/>
kiss each other. Thus the divine attributes meet together harmoniously, that real opposites may meet together harmo∣niously: This glorious meeting lays a foundation for these happy meetings.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) There are seeming opposites, that meet together harmoniously, by virtue of this glorious meeting; as,</P>
<P N="1">1. These opposite-like perfections of God meet together, and kiss each other harmoniously, that opposite-like <HI>provi∣dences</HI> might <HI>meet together and kiss each other.</HI> There are frowning <HI>providences</HI> and smiling <HI>providences,</HI> crosses and comforts in the believer's lot; here is a <HI>providence</HI> that fa∣vours the promise, and there is a <HI>providence</HI> that seems to contradict the promise; here is an up, and there is a down: Well, how shall these walk together? Why? They meet and embrace each other in Christ, the meeting-place; for <HI>all things work together for good to them that love him, and are the called according to his purpose.</HI> Hence we will find, not only light and darkness in the believer's lot, but sometimes light and darkness meeting together, Zech. 14.7. There you read of a day, that is <HI>neither day not night</HI>; yet <HI>a day known to the Lord neither clear not dark, but at evening time it shall be light</HI>: There evening-darkness ushering in the morning light. Hence they have occasion both to <HI>sing of mercy and of judgment,</HI> because of their meeting together, and kissing each other, and working together for good: Behold the cross and the crown meeting together.</P>
<P N="2">2. These opposite-like perfections of God meet together, and kiss each other, that opposite-like desires may meet, and embrace each other. While <HI>mercy</HI> desire, our life, and <HI>justice</HI> seems to demand our death; these are reconciled only in Christ, in whom <HI>mercy</HI> &amp; <HI>truth, righteousness</HI> &amp; <HI>peace</HI> meet and embrace each other. But look to our own desire of God's glory, and our salvation, men and angels could never have contrived how these two desires could be reconciled, if <HI>mercy</HI>

and <HI>truth</HI> had not met together, and kiss'd each other; for the glory of God's truth and righteousness, in the threatning of his law, seems to rest satisfied with nothing less than our destruction; and therefore to desire God's glory, would <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been to desire our own damnation; and consequently, in desiring our own salvation, we may have desired God's dishonour: But now this blessed contrivance of infinite wis∣dom lets us see how these two are, not only reconciled, but made inseparable; <HI>Having set forth Christ to be the propitia∣tion, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness in the remission of sins.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. These seemingly opposite attributes meet and kiss each other, that seemingly opposite graces might meet and em∣brace each other; for example, <HI>reverence</HI> and <HI>confidence.</HI> How shall <HI>fear</HI> &amp; <HI>reverence</HI> meet together with <HI>faith</HI> &amp; <HI>confi∣dence?</HI> Why, <HI>truth</HI> &amp; <HI>righteousness</HI> are at the meeting, and therefore fear &amp; reverence becomes us; but <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> are also on the bench, therefore faith &amp; holy confidence may boldly step in, <HI>We have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. These opposite-like attributes meet and embrace each other, that opposite-like duties may meet together. <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>praise</HI> seem opposite duties in some cases; prayer suppo∣ses our wants to be great, otherwise, why should we pray? Praise supposes our enjoyments to be great, otherwise, why should we praise? Well, <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness,</HI> these awful attributes, present at the meeting, say, we have nothing in ourselves, therefore we ought to pray; but <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> say, we have all, we have enough in Christ, and therefore we ought to Praise. <HI>Humiliation</HI> and <HI>gloriation</HI> seem opposite duties; but the seemingly opposite attributes of God meet∣ing together, bring also these duties to meet and embrace each other. Is <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> in the company with <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI>? Then humiliation is our duty; but is <HI>mer∣cy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> in company with <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness?</HI> Then
<PB N="42" REF="040455_0041_1016462E797E5688"/>
gloriation is our duty; <HI>let him that glories, glory in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. These seemingly opposite attributes of God meet and embrace each other, that seemingly opposite experiences may meet and embrace each other, and be reconciled, though seemingly irreconcileable. There are <HI>sad</HI> experiences, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> experiences: O here is the sad experience of a guilty conscience, a powerful corruption, and a conquering temp∣tation! Can ever that be reconciled with the experience of holy peace, pardon and victory? Yea, here is a foundation laid for the reconciliation of these opposites. If <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> have met together, then a guilty conscience and a mer∣cy-seat may meet together; a prevalent corruption and par∣doning purifying blood may meet together: as they did in the Psalmist's case, <HI>Psal.</HI> 65.3. <HI>Iniquities prevail against me: But as for our transgressions, thou wilt purge them away.</HI> The sad experience of fatherly anger, or of the feeling of divine wrath may meet with the sweet experience of felt love and favour; for <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>justice</HI> are met together, <HI>Isa.</HI> 54.7, 8. The sad experience of perplexing thoughts may meet with the sweet experience of spiritual consolation, &amp; be swallowed up there∣in; since <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>justice</HI> have met with <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace:</HI> Hence it was that these two met together in <HI>David,</HI> Psal. 94.19. <HI>In the multitudes of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my soul.</HI> O! Is such a sad experience consistent with an interest in Christ? Why? Both terrible and amiable at∣tributes of God meet together in Christ, and therefore it is not strange that the sadest and sweetest experiences meet to∣gether, so as not to be inconsistent with the state of a believ∣er that is in Christ. To see awful <HI>justice</HI> and lovely <HI>mercy</HI> meeting together in a sweet-smelling sacrifice, is a greater wonder, than to see your sadest &amp; sweetest experiences meet∣ing in Christ, to make up a Hallelujah, <HI>praise ye the Lord</HI>; and the former meeting in the reason of this.</P>
<P N="6">6. These irreconcileable-like attributes of God meet and
<PB N="43" REF="040455_0042_10164630DE315308"/>
embrace each other, that irreconcileable-like scriptures might meet together and embrace each other. How shall <HI>Exod.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. <HI>He will by no means clear the guilty,</HI> or justify the sinner, irreconciled with <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.5. where he is said <HI>to justify the ungodly</HI>? O how can these two opposites meet together? Why, <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> have met together in Christ, to make up a match betwixt them: A <HI>ransom</HI> is <HI>found, a propitiation</HI> is <HI>set forth</HI>; why then, these opposite-like scriptures may meet together, and kiss each other. <HI>He will by no means <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the guilty,</HI> without a ransom, a propitiation: Well, is the ransom found; and the propitiation set forth? Then he will justify the ungodly on that ground; <HI>Deliver his soul from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.</HI> Now, he can justify the sinner, and be just in so doing, while he draws him in to Christ by saith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.25, 26. Thus you see the reasons of the meeting. In a word, they meet together upon a design to bring the greatest good our of the greatest evil, and the highest glory out of the deepest misery, to the praise of all God's glorious perfections.</P>
<P>The <HI>fifth</HI> thing proposed was the <HI>application</HI> in a few in∣ferences. Is it so, that, in the salvation of sinners by Jesus Christ, the glorious attributes and perfections of God do thus harmoniously conspire and embrace each other? Then hence we may see,</P>
<P N="1">1. What a dreadful evil <HI>sin</HI> is, which sets all the attributes of God, as it were, at odds, and puts all the world into con∣fusion, &amp; every thing out of order; it sets heaven and earth and all things in them, at variance one against another. To think light of sin, is to think light of this glorious meeting of divine attributes, that met together to break this rebellion, and take order with this horrid insurrection against heaven. O what a great matter is the salvation of a sinner! Ere that can take place, this grand meeting must be called; all the occured attributes of God must have an honourable reparation.
<PB N="44" REF="040455_0043_101646349015F738"/>
<HI>Justice</HI> must be satisfied, <HI>truth</HI> vindicated, <HI>righteousness</HI> clear∣ed: And, in order to all this, a surery must be provided, even a God in our nature; the guilt must be imputed to him, and <HI>the iniquity of us all must be laid upon him</HI>; and then a bloody tragedy must be acted upon his soul and body, till he sink to death under the weight of infinite wrath. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Hence see what a wonderful person our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> is, in whom so many wonders meet together. It is in him that <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth, righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace do meet to∣gether, and kiss each other.</HI> Here all the bright perfections of the divine nature do gloriously conspire; here is the bright constellation of all the divine attributes shining forth in him, and every star performs its revolution in this orb. Behold in him the bright glory and excellency of God's grace and love, a whole Trinity in concert, each person to perform his own part, and each attribute its own work; and <HI>Christ the image of the invisible God set forth to be a</HI> glorious theatre, on which men and angels might see the splendor of the trans∣action;
<Q>He is the brightness of the Father's glory, and the express image of his person. <HI>Here is the</HI> great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh,</Q>
and all his at∣tributes meeting together, and kissing each other, in our <HI>Emmanuel, God-Man.</HI> There are two things meet in Christ, which should make him wonderful to us: The one is, all our sins meet together on him, that they may be condemned, according to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> word, <HI>Isa.</HI> 53.6. <HI>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all,</HI> or made them to <HI>meet</HI> on him: The other is, all the attributes of God meet in him, that they may be glorified: And indeed there is no saving or satisfying knowledge of any property of God, but what is to be had in Christ. To see God to be a merciful, just, true, righte∣ous, good and holy God, is neither a saving, nor a satisfying sight, unless we see these attributes meeting in Christ for our salvation; and to see this, is to see <HI>the glory of God in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="45" REF="040455_0044_1016463722278BA8"/>
face of Christ.</HI> Here see the glory of divine mercy! What is pardoning mercy? It is God's free gracious acceptance of a sinner, upon satisfaction made to his justice, in the blood of Jesus; Nor is any discovery of mercy, but as relating to the satisfaction of justice, consistent with the glory of God; mercy cannot be seen savingly, but as meeting with justice in Christ. Here also we see the glory of divine truth in the exact accomplishment of all his threatnings and promises. That original threatning and commination, whence all other threatnings flow, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. 'In the day thou eatest there∣of thou shalt surely die, <HI>backed with a curse,</HI> 'For cursed is 'every one that continues not in all things, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is in him accomplished fully, and the truth of God therein cleared to our salvation, while <HI>he tasted death death for us, and was made a curse for us</HI>; so that, in every threatning his truth is made glorious. And, as to the promises, <HI>they are all</HI> Yea <HI>and</HI> Amen <HI>in Christ Jesus, to the glory of God by us.</HI> 2 Cor. 1.20. And so of all the other attributes of God, they are made glorious and exalted in Christ to our salvation. Hence when Christ desired his father to glorify his name, <HI>John</HI> 12.28. to make his name, that is, his nature, and properties, and perfections all glorious in the work of redemption, that he had in hand; he was instantly answered from heaven,
<Q>I have both glori∣fied it and will glorify it again;</Q>
I will give my attributes their utmost glory in thee.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence see the difference betwixt the <HI>law</HI> and the <HI>gos∣pel.</HI> One great difference betwixt them lies in this, that, in the law, the sinner that hath violated the same, may see <HI>truth</HI> standing engaged against him, but no <HI>mercy</HI> in company with <HI>truth</HI>; and <HI>righteousness</HI> in arms against him, but no <HI>peace</HI> in company with <HI>righteousness. Justice without mercy,</HI> and <HI>war without peace,</HI> to the sinner, is the <HI>motto</HI> of the law: For therein <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> meet together, but <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> are not at the meeting; and so the language of the law,
<PB N="46" REF="040455_0045_101646396C3828F0"/>
to you that are out of Christ, and under the law, is, no mercy, no peace, but the wrath of God, the vengeance of God, the curse of God upon you, and that so sure as God is a God of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI>: There is the <HI>law.</HI> But in the <HI>gospel, mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> come into the <HI>meeting,</HI> and make up a <HI>match</HI> betwixt all the <HI>opposite-like parties, to the highest glory of God, and the greatest happiness of the sinner; and they seal the match with a kiss of infinite complacency,</HI> so that the sum of the gospel is this, <HI>mercy and truth are met together, righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Hence we may see what is the fountain-head and foun∣dation of all true <HI>communion</HI> and <HI>fellowship</HI> with God and man. This glorious meeting is the foundation of all other happy meetings; fellowship with God, &amp; an happy meeting with him, is a stream that flows from this fountain. We could never have met with God, or got a kindly kiss or em∣brace in the arms of his favour and love, if this divine meet∣ing and embracement had not made way for it. Fellowship with man, or the communion of saints, is a rivulet that flows from this spring. When saints meet together for prayer or praises, under the influence of the spirit, and under a gale of heaven; when their hearts are fired with love to God, and to one another in him; what is this? It is just a live-coal cast in among them from the altar, Christ Jesus, where all the attributes of God meet together, and kiss each other; and hence true fellowship with God, and with the saints, are both declared to be in and thro' Christ Jesus, 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.3.
<Q>That which we have heard and seen, declare we unto you, that ye may have fellowship with us: And truly our fel∣lowship is with the Father, and with his Son Christ.</Q>
The harmony of the attributes of God in Christ, is the fountain of all the harmony among the saints: The little harmony that takes place among them in our day, and the rarity of holy fellowship meetings, flows from the little faith of this
<PB N="47" REF="040455_0046_1016463B42BC12C0"/>
heavenly divine meeting; for all the saints, that are under the lively views thereof, cannot but desire to meet together and embrace eaach other harmoniously, in the arms of mutual love.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence see the malignity of the sin of <HI>unbelief,</HI> the great employment whereof is, to <HI>spoil the harmony</HI> of the divine perfections, and to do its utmost to <HI>dissolve</HI> that glorious meeting, and <HI>separate</HI> what God hath joined, saying, in ef∣fect, they have not met together, nor kissed each other. This we may discern in the unbelief, whether of secure or awak∣ened sinners: See it in the unbelief of the secure sinner, who sets <HI>truth</HI> &amp; <HI>righteousness</HI> out of the meeting, saying, God, is a merciful God, <HI>&amp; I shall have peace, tho' I walk in the immagina∣tion of my own heart, adding drunkenness to thirst</HI>: Thus <HI>they hope in God's mercy,</HI> &amp; speak peace to themselves, while they never view the truth and righteousness of God, and how the credit thereof shall be saved, or the honour thereof repaired▪ hence, as faith is said to <HI>set to the seal, that God is true,</HI> or that he is a God of truth, so unbelief is said to <HI>make God a liar.</HI> To fancy that God will have mercy on their souls, without regarding the truth of his threatnings, is to make God a liar, and say, mercy and truth have not met together; to think that God will be at peace with them, while his righteousness and justice are not satisfied, is to make God a liar, and say, righteousness and peace have not met together. Thus the unbelief of the secure sinner puts <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> out of the meeting. Again, on the other hand, the unbelief of the awakened sinner puts <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> out of the meeting, saying, O he is a God of truth, and how shall he have mercy on the like of me? He is a God of awful justice and righte∣ousness, and how will he be at peace with me? What is the language of this, but that <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> have not met with <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI>? Here is a making God a liar also, and separating what God hath in the gospel declared to be
<PB N="48" REF="040455_0047_1016463FAB32D680"/>
joined. Behold then the malignity of unbelief; it breaks the glorious meeting, and will not let them kiss one another. The presuming sinner will not let God have the glory of his truth and righteousness, the despairing sinner will not let God have the glory of his mercy and grace; both are in a concert with the devil to break the harmony of the meeting. But O, may virtue come from that glorious meeting in Christ, to the poor sinful meeting in this house, for dashing your unbelief to pieces, that we may see <HI>mercy and truth meet together, righte∣ousness and peace kissing each other.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Hence see sure and noble ground for the <HI>boldness</HI> and <HI>confidence</HI> of faith in Christ; <HI>In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him,</HI> Eph. 3.12. Here's an answer to all the objections of unbelief and diffidence, the chief whereof lies here; O, says unbelief, may I, sinful guil∣ty I, lay hold on the promise of mercy and peace in the gos∣pel, when I see the great ordnance of the divine threatning hard charged with the truth and righteousness of God, and ready to be discharged against me with thunder and lightning, saying, no mercy, no peace; <HI>He that made thee will not have mercy upon thee</HI>; and <HI>there is no peace, says my God, to the wick∣ed?</HI> Mercy and peace in the promise then, says unbelief, cannot take place with respect to me; for truth and righte∣ousness in the threatning stand in the way, <HI>like a flaming sword, to keep the way of the tree of life.</HI> Nay, but, says faith, here the promise and the threatning have met together, and kissed each other in Christ; mercy in the promise, and justice in the threatning, have met and agreed in him, <HI>in whom all the promises are Yea and Amen,</HI> and in whom all the threatnings are fully executed, by drawing out his heart-blood. Thus then, <HI>we have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</HI> Heb. 10.19. <HI>By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us through the vail of his flesh: Therefore let us draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of saith.</HI> O what
<PB N="49" REF="040455_0048_101646413189CB10"/>
ground for the boldness and assured confidence of faith, with particular application, notwithstanding the threatning! The threatning hath nothing to say to me, saith faith, for Christ hath spoken with it already, and spoken it out of breath; he hath left it speechless and breathless; not a breathing of wrath in it towards me. The believer may have a million of doubts, while his unbelief keeps the chair; but let gallant faith come in, and take the room, it will dispel them all. Let once unbelief break the harmony of this meeting of divine attributes in Christ, and then nothing but doubts of God's favour and mercy must ensue; but let faith view the har∣mony, and see them meeting and kissing each other, and then, according to the measure of faith, such will be the measure of holy boldness, confidence and perswasion of the favour, mercy and good-will of God in Christ, with parti∣cular application to the person himself. Take away unbe∣lief from faith, and then not a single doubt will remain be∣hind: Unbelief creates all the doubts that are in the believer, his faith hath no part in them. The general doubtful faith of the <HI>Papists</HI> is not faith, but unbelief; and therefore no wonder that our forefathers abjured it in our national cove∣nant. Behold the sure ground and firm bottom that faith stands upon, even the mutual meeting and embracement among the divine perfections in Christ. If you break and separate the meeting by unbelief, then your confidence is broken, and your peace with God marr'd; but, if you keep them toge∣ther in your view by faith in Christ, then you have boldness confidence and affiance on this ground: yea, then God in Christ and you meet together, and kiss each other.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hence we see what is the <HI>best mark</HI> of a believer in Christ, for your trial and examination: Try it just by this, What view have you got of this <HI>glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,</HI> and of the attributes of God meeting and em∣bracing each other in him? Have you seen the <HI>glory,</HI> and felt the <HI>virtue</HI> of this happy meeting?</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="50" REF="040455_0049_10164644834AFCB0"/>1. Have you seen the <HI>glory</HI> of it? When once in a day you had seen the attributes of God in arms against you, because of your sinful rebellion against God, and when you had seen the truth of God pronouncing the sentence of the law, and his righteousness and justice ready to inflict the sentence, and execute the same with curses and vengeance, making you despair of mercy, and give up with all hope and expectation of peace with God by the law of works; have you thereupon got a view of the harmonious meeting of these attributes of God, in Christ Jesus, as the surety, the sacrifice, the ransom, the propitiation, in whom the truth and veracity of God is accomplished, and the righteousness and justice of God satis∣fied? And so mercy and peace vented gloriously, without detriment to any other excellency or perfection of God. Hath nothing satisfied your conscience, but the view of this meeting betwixt <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>justice,</HI> in the death of Christ, and kissing each other in his mediation? Hath God and you met together this way, and made your heart joyful to kiss and em∣brace this wonderful device, as worthy of God, and suitable to you? Have you seen his glory at this rate? Then, in God's name, I pronounce you a believer in Christ; <HI>For God, who commanded light to shine out of darkness, hath shined into your heart, to give you the light of the knowledge of his glory, in the face of Christ</HI>; and Christ and you met together, and kissed each other! Whether it was in the day of first believ∣ing, when you fled to him for refuge, or in the day of after-manifestation, when, upon the back of dismal hiding on God's part, or grievous backsliding on yours, the Lord drew aside the vail, and gave you a glance of his glory; whether it was by some word of grace, sweetly and powerfully coming in, and opening your understanding, to see this harmonious meet∣ing, or by some sweet droppings of the blood of sprinkling upon your conscience, by which blood the meeting is ce∣mented together. Have you seen this glory, whether in a secret corner, or publick ordinance; whether at the market-cross
<PB N="51" REF="040455_0050_10164648C2610DF8"/>
of the gospel, where this glorious meeting is proclaim∣ed of at a communion-table, where it is sealed? It is all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was heaven begun.</P>
<P N="2">2. Have you felt the <HI>virtue,</HI> as well as seen the glory of this harmonious meeting of the divine attributes in Christ? 2 Cor. 3.18. <HI>Behold, as in a glass, the glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same image, from glory to glory as by the spirit of the Lord.</HI> Surely, if you have seen this glory, you have felt something of this virtue, by <HI>changing</HI> you <HI>from glory to glory.</HI> It is true, many that have got a discovery of this glory of the Lord, can never think that they have felt the sanctifying virtue thereof, and this keeps them down in the pit of dis∣couragement; it is true, they that are not sanctified, and made holy, they discover, that they never beheld this glory of the Lord: For this meeting of attributes makes a meet∣ing of graces in the person that sees it savingly. But you must remember, that this virtue will never be perfectly felt, 'till this glory be perfectly beheld in heaven, where <HI>we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is</HI>: And therefore, since you cannot judge and try yourself by a perfect sancti∣fication, try it by the beginnings of it; this transforming virtue, this sanctifying virtue is present with you, though you cannot discern it. But, that you may thro' grace discern something of it, let me ask you, What makes you wrestle in secret sometimes against sin, if it be not some sanctifying virtue? What makes the prevalency of sin to humble you to the dust? What makes you lament your own unholiness and impurity? What makes you long and groan for compleat victory over, and freedom from, sin,? What makes you glad of any victory over your corruption, when this glory shines? What makes your heart to rise against sin? and, when sin prevails, what makes you find yourselves uneasy, and continually out of your element, 'till the Lord return, and until you get a new dip in the <HI>Jordan of the blood of the Lamb</HI>? You have no mercy on your lusts, and are at no
<PB N="52" REF="040455_0051_1016464A46ACCD20"/>
peace with them, but still crying vengeance upon them! Why, it is just the sanctifying virtue that flows from this view of the glory of God in Christ, in whom <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> meet with <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness.</HI> If you fall and stumble at any time, believer, is it not like the stumbling of a horse, that makes you run the faster? So as you get more good of one fall, than a natural man will get of a hundred duties, while it makes you still the more humble and watchful, and circumspect and dependent. Why, by all this, it appears (whatever be the defect of your sanctification) that <HI>having beheld the glory of God, you are changed into the same image from glory to glory</HI>; you have seen the glory, and felt the virtue of this harmonious meeting of divine attributes in Christ. But then again,</P>
<P N="8">8. Hence we may see ground of <HI>terror</HI> to all christless, unbelieving souls, that never have seen the glory, nor felt the virtue of this harmonious meeting, and live careless a∣bout either of these. What shall I say? <HI>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <HI>In whom the God of this World hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ should shine into them.</HI> May be, you are presuming upon the mercy of God, while yet your eyes are blinded, that you do not see the truth of his threatnings standing against you: And therefore, O blasphemer, do not think that he will be a God of <HI>mercy,</HI> and not a God of <HI>truth?</HI> Nay, his mercy will never be vented, unless the glory of his truth be saved. May be you are speak∣ing peace to yourself, saying, <HI>I shall have peace</HI>; while yet your eyes are blinded, that you do not see how God's being at peace with a sinner is consistent with his righteousness in taking vengeance upon sin. O then, blasphemer and pre∣sumer, do you think that God will be a God of <HI>peace,</HI> and not a God of <HI>righteousness?</HI> know it then, in the Lord's name, O sinful unbelieving wretch, that, as there is no mercy for you, to the discredit of God's truth; so no peace,
<PB N="53" REF="040455_0052_1016464CC8728D48"/>
to the dishonour of his righteousness. You expect <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> seperate from <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI>; and there∣fore <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> shall be separate from you, and <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> will meet with you in fury, and with a ven∣geance Your false hope of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> makes you mer∣ciful to your lusts, and at peace with your ideas; but the <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> of God, which you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the meeting, will hide <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> for ever <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your eyes. <HI>Justice</HI> instead of <HI>mercy,</HI> war instead of <HI>peace,</HI> will ensue; for <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> will execute judgment upon you, for the abuse of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace.</HI> While, through unbelief you do not see or approve their meeting, together and kissing each other in Christ: While you are in this case, you cannot meet with God; tho', you may meet with his people at ordinances, or at a communion-table, yet God and you ne∣ver met together: Nay, you have other company, the devil and you meet together, and your lusts and you embrace each other; the world and you meet together, and its vanities and you do kiss each other; the law and you have met together, and its curse and you do embrace each other. But, because you do not see the terrible curses and threatnings that you are under, remember that, in a short while, death and you will meet together, and its cold arms and you must embrace each other; and, if this gospel be hid to you, then, after that, hell and you will meet together, and the flames of di∣vine wrath and you will embrace each other to eternity; and the <HI>motto</HI> written upon the door of your hell will be, <HI>The vengeance of truth and righteousness, for the abuse of mercy and peace.</HI> Let this word of terror sink into your conscience, O graceless, christless, unbelieving soul, that never saw the glo∣ry, nor felt the virtue of this blessed meeting, and, <HI>Galio</HI>-like, <HI>care for none of these things.</HI> But on the other hand,</P>

Christ. This doctrine is as comfortable to you, as it is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r∣rible to others. Can you say before God, That these last two marks are your experience? Then I can say, that all the comforts, that issue from that glorious meeting in Christ, be∣long to you; and God allows you <HI>strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to the hope set before you:</HI> For <HI>that city of refuge, to which you have fled,</HI> is the cencre of the meeting, and the place appointed, where <HI>they kiss one another</HI> harmoniously. Why, say you, <HI>What concern have I in their meeting and em∣bracing each other?</HI> O believer, they met together for your sake, and kissed one another out of kindness to you: For there was no real jarring among them, but all the apparent jarring was about you, and how they should be glorified in your salvation; and when infinite wisdom found the ransom and so the way how they should all be glorified in your eter∣nal happiness, then they hugged each other in their arms, as it were, in a rapture of joy, for your sake. Prov. 8.31. <HI>His delights were with the sons of Men.</HI> It was not one attribute only, that had its delight, satisfaction and glory, 'tis <HI>delights</HI> in the plural number; for all the <HI>attributes of God</HI> had their <HI>delights</HI>: And about what was it? Why the <HI>counsel of peace</HI> was concerning you; <HI>for his delights were with the sons of men.</HI> And you having seen the glory of this device, and felt something of the virtue thereof, God and you have met to∣gether, and Christ and you have kissed each other; he hath embraced you, and you have embraced him; and that em∣bracement is a pledge and earnest, that he and you will meet together in heaven, and embrace each other to eternity. This meeting and embracement is founded upon the harmo∣nious meeting and embracement of the divine attributes in Christ; and therefore it shall be sure, abiding and everlast∣ing; and all these attributes are engaged for your comfort and support, and <HI>this glory of the Lord you shall for ever behold</HI>: For Christ, in whom all these glorious perfections meet to∣gether, hath prayed for it, <HI>John</HI> 17.24. <HI>Father, I will, that
<PB N="55" REF="040455_0054_10164652C9E3A1A8"/>
these whom thou hast given me,</HI> &amp;c. Here then, believer, is ground of comfort to you, in every case: comfort against <HI>desertion.</HI> Is it long since Christ and you met together, and kissed each other? Behold, here is the reason, why, <HI>he will never altogether leave you, nor forsake you</HI>; but still meet with you now and then, when he sees it fit, and give you the o∣ther kiss of his infinitely blessed lips, &amp; embrace of his arms, till you come to the intimate, immediate embracements of his love in glory; why, because <HI>mercy and truth are met toge∣ther, righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</HI> So sure as mercy and truth are met together, as surely will the Lord meet with you. Here is comfort against the <HI>law,</HI> when it comes in as a covenant upon your conscience, saying, <HI>Pay what thou owest, or otherwise thou art cursed, and must go to hell</HI>; and the law, speaking in the name of <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righte∣ousness,</HI> seems terrible: But you may soon answer by faith, and say, <HI>O law, the demand is just indeed, and agreeable to</HI> truth <HI>and</HI> righteousness; <HI>but you mistake the person: For</HI> truth <HI>and</HI> righteousness <HI>have already met with</HI> mercy <HI>and</HI> peace, <HI>in the person of Christ my husband, who endured all my hell, and became a curse for me; and therefore I have no ground to fear the hell thou threatnest, nor the curse thou denouncest, nor any liableness thereto.</HI> Here is comfort against <HI>Satan</HI> &amp; his temp∣tations. For this blessed meeting in Christ did concert his ruin, and the bruising of his head. Here is comfort against <HI>church-divisions</HI> and <HI>commotions</HI>: When neither ministers nor private christians do meet together, or embrace one another with love and amity; is this sad and afflicting to you? Here is a meeting, that may give you comfort in that case: For no member of that meeting will ever fall out among themselves, or fall out with you. Here is comfort against your jarring with friends: What do I know but there is some here that cannot get lived in peace with such a friend or relation, nor their christian liberty enjoyed, be∣cause of their frowns? And may be they are as aliens to you,
<PB N="56" REF="040455_0055_1016465532F91668"/>
not in speaking terms with you; you cannot meet together with them <HI>cordially,</HI> nor embrace one another <HI>amicably</HI>: But let this be <HI>your comfort</HI> in that case, <HI>mercy and truth are met to∣gether, righteousness and peace have kissed each other</HI>; and you have got a kiss by the by, and that is better than all the kind∣ness of all the friends in the world. Here is comfort against <HI>publick calamities</HI> that seem to be approaching, or personal trials that may be coming upon you. Here is a cordial, though affliction and you meet together; tho' in a little time death and you meet together; yet this meeting of divine at∣tributes in Christ, your glorious head; speaks comfort and safety to you in every case. Though you should die distracted, this meeting cannot be dissolved; and you, having seen the glory, and felt the virtue thereof, shall be sure to enjoy the benefit of it to eternity: <HI>Yea, surely goodness and mercy shall follow you all the days of your life, and you shall dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. The last inference is, Hence see the <HI>duty</HI> of <HI>all that hear</HI> and <HI>know this joyful sound.</HI> Never was there a sweeter sound in heaven, or in earth: And what is the duty of all you that hear it? Surely, the news of such a glorious and harmonious meeting of the divine perfections, about the salvation of sinners in and by Christ Jesus, should be joyfully received. Here are <HI>the good tidings of great joy to all people,</HI> Luke 2.10. When <HI>Elisabeth</HI> the mother of <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> the mother of Jesus our Lord, met together and saluted each other, <HI>the babe leap in Elisabeth's womb for joy.</HI> Behold, here is yet a more wonderful meeting and salutation among the jarring-like attributes and perfections of God; and surely, if the <HI>babe</HI> of grace be in <HI>your womb, it will leap for joy,</HI> when you perceive such a blessed meeting and salutation. O may it not bring our heart to our mouth, and make it flutter within us, when we hear of such a salutation as this, <HI>mercy and truth are met together</HI>! &amp;c. And again, What is your duty, be∣liever, who not only hears, but knows this joyful sound?
<PB N="57" REF="040455_0056_1016465721B29258"/>
Your duty is, not only to rejoice in this matchless harmoni∣ous conjunction of divine attributes in Christ, but to ex∣emplify the same, by an harmonious conjunction of graces and holy virtues in you. Let <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> meeting to∣gether, as divine attributes, in Christ, be exemplified by <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> meeting together, as divine virtues in you: Let <HI>righteousness</HI> &amp; <HI>peace</HI> kissing each other in him, be exem∣plified by <HI>righteousness</HI> &amp; <HI>peace</HI> kissing each other in you: Let the meeting of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth</HI> engage you to be merciful and true; <HI>merciful,</HI> because <HI>your heavenly Father is merciful</HI>; and <HI>true,</HI> because <HI>he desires truth in the inward parts.</HI> Let the embraces of <HI>righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> engage you to be righte∣ous and peaceable, that is, to be students of purity and peace: <HI>For the wisdom that is from above, is first pure, and then peacea∣ble,</HI> Jam 3.17. It is declared in the verse following our text, that it is the design of these perfections of God, looking down <HI>harmoniously</HI> from heaven, to make suitable graces spring up from the earth: <HI>Truth shall spring out of the earth, and righteousness shall look down from heaven.</HI> When <HI>the Son of righteousness,</HI> in whom all the excellencies of God do shine, looks down; then as the natural sun, sheddings its influences, makes fruit to spring up from the earth; so the Sun of righ∣teousness looking down, and shedding abroad his influences, makes <HI>truth,</HI> and all the rest of <HI>the fruits of the spirit,</HI> to spring out of the earth, out of the heart, the soil where they are sown, in regeneration. O does <HI>mercy</HI> look down from hea∣ven to you, in friendship with <HI>truth</HI>; shall not this mercy make you merciful to the bodies and souls of others, by do∣ing them all the temporal and spiritual good that you can? And shall God manifest his <HI>truth,</HI> in conjunction with <HI>mercy</HI> towards you; and will you not be a friend to <HI>truth</HI> even to all the precious truths of his gospel? Shall not <HI>truth,</HI> in op∣position to hypocrisy, be your study; and <HI>truth,</HI> in opposition to error, be your concern; and this <HI>truth,</HI> in conjunction with <HI>mercy</HI>? For, when <HI>truth</HI> is in any Hazard, should not
<PB N="58" REF="040455_0057_1016465A9E1F49D8"/>
<HI>mercy</HI> to your own soul, and the souls of others, make you zealous for it? And <HI>mercy</HI> to your children and the genera∣tion that is to come after you, on whom we show no <HI>mercy,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> truth be not transmitted purely to them, as it was by our forefathers to us, at the expence of their blood, however now the waters of the sanctuary are troubled. Again, does <HI>righ∣teousness</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> look down from heaven, kindly embracing each other in your behalf, believer; And shall not you be a student of <HI>righteousness,</HI> in opposition to all unrighteous and unholy ways; and of <HI>peace,</HI> in opposition to contention and discord? <HI>As much as possible, follow peace with all men and ho∣liness, without which no man shall see the Lord.</HI> Does God glorify his <HI>righteousness</HI> towards you; and will you study no <HI>righteousness</HI> in your conversation towards God and man? Does <HI>God speak peace to you,</HI> and will you be at <HI>war with him,</HI> and love to live in war with any of his? Shall that be the disposition of any, with whom God is at peace? <HI>O tell it not in</HI> Gath; Surely there are none here, that have tasted of this sweet peace of God, but they would desire to live at <HI>peace with all men,</HI> and particularly all the saints. They would desire to see all the honest ministers of <HI>Scotland</HI> meeting to∣gether more kindly than they do, and embracing each other. Some indeed are at this time reproached as enemies to peace in the church; but the matter is, peace must not be studied separately from <HI>righteousness,</HI> not <HI>mercy</HI> separately from <HI>truth,</HI> but all as meeting and embracing one another: For <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> without <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness,</HI> is a cruel conspi∣racy against God and man. Now certain things have past concerning the truths of God, and the righteousness of Christ, in our day, which some think will stand infamous till doom's-day; and, this <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> being the great mini∣sterial trust, some chused rather to be reproach'd by the world as enemies to peace, than be challenged by God and their own consciences as betrayers of the trust. However, O be∣lieve,
<PB N="59" REF="040455_0058_1016465F38224128"/>
study you through grace to get a match made up be∣twixt <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth, righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> in you, seeing there can be no merciful <HI>peace</HI> to the prejudice of righteous <HI>truth</HI>: And study to get all these attributes of God exempli∣fied in your heart and life, and the seal and impress thereof upon your soul, you being united to Christ, in whom all these glorious excellencies of God do meet together with harmo∣nious embracements. <HI>Out of Christ's fulness do you receive, and grace for grace.</HI> As the child receives member for mem∣ber from the father, and the paper letter for letter from the press; so, <HI>beholding his glory, be you changed into the same image,</HI> by receiving <HI>mercy</HI> for <HI>mercy, truth</HI> for <HI>truth, righte∣ousness</HI> for <HI>righteousness,</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> for <HI>peace: Out of his fulness do you receive grace for grace,</HI> holiness for holiness, and an holy virtue suitable to every holy perfection that is in him, and all these harmoniously meeting together and kissing each other in you: Let no heavenly grace or holy duty be excluded out of the meeting: Let saith and repentance meet together, let love &amp; new obedience kiss each other; let knowledge &amp; prac∣tice meet together, &amp; prayer &amp; praises embrace each other. Yea, let opposite-like graces meet harmoniously in you: Let humility and boldness meet together, let godly sorrow and holy joy embrace each other. Here is the gospel-holiness we call you to, in a suitableness to these harmonious attri∣butes of God in Christ: If the world call you <HI>Antinomians,</HI> known it is <HI>the will of God, that by well-doing you put to silence the ignorance of follish men,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.15. Let the mouth that reproaches the gospel be stopt by the power of it in your walk. The <HI>world</HI> will surely reckon you the greatest stars, that give the greatest light: <HI>Therefore let your light so shine before men, that others seeing your good works may glorify God</HI>: even the works of <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>truth righteousness</HI> and <HI>peace,</HI> hand in hand together: And thus, for the sake of the glory of God, the honour of Christ, and the credit of the gospel, let the world know, that you have seen the glory, and felt the virtue of
<PB N="60" REF="040455_0059_10164660D5A51F58"/>
these perfections of God, harmoniously meeting and embrac∣ing each other in Christ. Here is your duty and work, be∣liever, in the wilderness; and now in all your short-comings therein, still <HI>look again to God's holy temple,</HI> to Christ the meet∣ing-place of these divine perfections: This is the mercy∣seat, of which God says, <HI>Exod.</HI> 25.22. <HI>There will I meet with thee, and commune with thee from between the Cherubims.</HI> And every new meeting with God there, will bring in new strength for all your work and warfare in time, till God and you meet together, and embrace one another in glory through eternity?</P>
<P>And now, believer, I know you would desire that others should share of the same happiness with you; and therefore pray that a short concluding word may be blessed with pow∣er to thousands that hear me. O ye that are <HI>by standers</HI> and <HI>hearers</HI> only, in what ever corner of this house round about me, whether you be in my view or not, you are in God's view; and I have a word from him to you all: And, as I have told you what a terrible thing is is to live and die in un∣belief with respect to this glorious device, so now I would tell you your duty in this matter, and how you may share of the blessings &amp; benefits, in time and for ever, that flow from this glorious meeting and embracement; and it is by kissing the Son of God, in whom all these attributes of God do kiss and embrace each other, Psal. 2.12. <HI>Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: Blessed are all they that trust in him.</HI> Blessed are all they that kiss and embrace him. Would you then share of the grace and glory that issue from this wonderful meeting, and ineffable embracement among the divine perfections, in Christ the Son of God? O then, come and kiss the Son: O down, down with carnal tho'ts, carnal kissing, carrousing, and cajolling; here, here is an object worthy of the most endeared embraces of the immortal soul. O come, and
<PB N="61" REF="040455_0060_10164663C1389B58"/>
kiss the Son, by believing in him, and applying the be∣nefits of this glorious transaction to yourself: And, be who you will, if you kiss and embrace the Son, you shall find these glorious attributes of God kissing and embracing you and hugging you in their arms, as a darling of heaven, and a special favorite in the house of God. Are the attributes of God embracing one another in Christ? O flee into their embraces, by fleeing into Christ. <HI>Say not, Christ is in hea∣ven, how shall I embrace him? For the word is nigh thee, even in your mouth, and in your heart,</HI> Rom. 10.8. <HI>q. d.</HI> So near is he in this word, that you may kiss him with your mouth, as it were, and embrace him in your heart; and to take in his word of grace, and Christ in it, is to embrace him. What do you say against Christ? Are you afraid that <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>righteousness</HI> conspire against you, and hinder <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>peace</HI> from ever meeting with you, and embracing you? O no, fear not; only believe, <HI>that mercy and truth are met together,</HI> and that <HI>righteous∣ness and peace have kissed each other</HI> in Christ. <HI>Truth</HI> will not stand in the way of <HI>mercy</HI>; for they have met together: <HI>Righ∣teousness</HI> will not stand in the way of <HI>peace</HI>; for they have kissed each other. He is indeed an infinitely just God, to take vengeance upon sin; but <HI>justice</HI> will not hinder <HI>mercy</HI> from coming to you: Only believe that <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> are reconciled in Christ, so as <HI>mercy</HI> can vent itself towards you, to the credit of <HI>justice.</HI> But O! may such a blackmouthed sinner as I, as black as hell and the devil, expect a kiss of such an infinitely fair Jesus? Is that to be expected, that such op∣posites should meet in one another's arms? Ye, allow me, tho' a black sinner like yourself, to be the happy messenger, to tell you in God's name, that be you as black as you will, such a meeting and embracing betwixt Christ and you is more to be expected, than ever men or angels could have expected that infinite <HI>justice</HI> and <HI>mercy</HI> should have met together, and kissed each other in a God-man; and this unexpected meeting
<PB N="62" REF="040455_0061_101646656CCEA848"/>
is the very ground upon which your expectation of a meeting with, &amp; embracement of God in Christ, is to be founded: O then, come, &amp; kiss the Son. Why but I cannot, say you; I think I would fain do it; but I cannot get at him, to kiss and embrace him. Indeed this kindness must begin on his side; and therefore, O pray that he would come, &amp; meet you with a kiss of infinite love. Say with the church, <HI>Song</HI> 1.2. <HI>Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: For his love is better then wine.</HI> If that be the language of your soul, O I cannot embrace him; but my heart says, O let him come &amp; embrace me, and draw me out of the embracements of all my former lovers and lusts that I may never kiss any idol in the world again, but may live &amp; die in the arms &amp; embraces of the Son of God; is that the language of you soul before the living GOD? why then the embracement betwixt Christ and you is begun, that shall never have an end; for it is a pledge, that he and you shall meet together in heaven, and embrace each other to eternity.</P>
<P>Now, though I hope that this glorious meeting of divine perfections in Christ hath put forth some vitrue to draw in some poor soul to the match; yet I fear that the most part are yet but idle hearers &amp; spectators, as if they were not concern∣ed: But O unconcerned soul, be who you will, O yet, will you come and see this great sight! O come and see the <HI>greatest sight that ever was,</HI> or will be, in heaven or earth, <HI>a bush burn∣ing and not consumed</HI>; all the burning and shining attributes of God meeting together with infinite harmony in the bush of our nature, and yet the bush able <HI>to bear the glory,</HI> Zech. 6.13. O come and wonder! Here is the wonder of men and angels! For this is a wonderful meeting to them: And the name of the meeting-place is justly called, <HI>wonderful</HI>! O come and partake; for the meeting is concerning your salva∣tion in Christ: <HI>His delights were with the sons of men.</HI> O come and sing to the praise and glory of this wonderful harmonious embracement of divine perfections in Christ, especially you
<PB N="63" REF="040455_0062_10164668CED16948"/>
that partake, so as to see the glory, and feel the virtue thereof O will you sing with your hearts, and lips, and lives, saying. <HI>Glory to God,</HI> that his attributes have meet together, and kissed each other, in Christ; and that ever the like of me got a kiss by the by: <HI>Glory to God,</HI> that there is no breaking off this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ting, nor parting of these embraces, by sin, <HI>Satan,</HI> earth or hell; but that they meet and embrace each other to eternity. And tho' you cannot remmember to sing all that hath been said, yet I hope the weakest memory may remem∣ber to sing the best note of all the sermon every day, saying, <HI>Glory, glory, glory, to God, that mercy and truth are met toge∣ther, righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</HI></P>
