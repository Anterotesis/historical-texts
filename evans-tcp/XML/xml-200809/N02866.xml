<P>AN Excellent Sermon Upon the GREAT <HI>SALVATION.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THis excellent Sermon comes to you upon the most important Errand that can possibly be, even to perswade you to embrace the great Salvation offered to you in the Gos∣pel, by a glorious Redeemer: One would think few Arguments might perswade Peo∣ple to embrace a Blessing so much to their Pleasure, Profit and Advantage; but sad it is to see that the most inexpressibly glori∣ous Things of the heavenly World are so slighted, neglected and despised by almost all the sinful Race of fallen apostate Man: And how much more strange that so many Argu∣ments must be used and that to so little Pur∣pose, to perswade Men to accept of such glo∣rious Things as in the Word of God we are assured are prepared for, and shall certainly be given to the Embracers of this great Sal∣vation. The Author who is now reaping the happy Fruits and Effects thereof, and beholding and enjoying the Blessings that doth accompany the same, has so sweetly and earnestly perswaded to the Embracement thereof, that I shall say no more, but look up to the God of all Grace for his Blessing up∣on the delightful, awakening, Soul comfort∣ing Discourse,</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>SERMON</HI> Concerning the <HI>Great Salvation.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>HEB. II. 3.</HI></BIBL>
<P>How shall we escape if we neglect so great Salvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE are two great and most ordinary Complaints in these days. 1. There are many who complain, that their Estates and Persons are in Bondage, and that they are sold for slaves to the Hands of Strangers: But, O that we could also turn over the Complaint to this, that our Souls are in Bondage, and that we are yet <HI>in the Gall of Bitterness, and in the Bond of Iniquity,</HI> that so we might be provoked
<PB N="2" REF="003424_0004_0FF83C404CADDD68"/>
to long for the great Salvation that is in our Offer. 2. There are many complain∣ing (and not without much cause) that there is now such a toleration of Errors: But O wilt thou complain also of this, that within thy Heart there is a Tollera∣tion of Lusts; is there not an Act of Tol∣leration concluded within thy Breast, that the Devil and all his Company may reign in thee at Pleasure: Oh have ye not need of the great Salvation? Shall I tell you, that Christ is courting you to embrace it, and that he putteth all his most glorious Robes upon you, and manifesteth himself unto you, as a Suiter making offer of him∣self and of his great Salvation O tell me, Have ye seen him? Or do ye think to see him this Day? What Robes had he on? There are five glorious Robes where∣with he cloaths himself when he conde∣scendeth to manifest himself to his people. First he cometh to his own with the <HI>Gar∣ments of Salvation,</HI> according to that Word, Zech. 9.9. <HI>Rejoice O Daughter of Sion greatly, shout O Daughter of Jerusalem:</HI> for <HI>behold, thy King cometh unto thee, he is just, and having Salvation</HI>; ay, your King is come here to day, and will ye not fall in love with him when he is cloathed with the Garments of Salvation, can ye e∣ver have a more conquering Sight of Christ, then when he is cloathed with such an excellent Robe, and offering you Salvation.
<PB N="3" REF="003424_0005_0FF83C41D829A758"/>
Secondly, He appeareth to his own <HI>in Garments died in Blood,</HI> according to that Word, Isai. 63.1, 2. <HI>Who is this that com∣eth up from Edom with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed Garments in Blood, as one that treadeth the Wine fat.</HI> And now I say to thee that will not look to Christ, when he appears in the Gar∣ments of Salvation, have ye a Heart to refuse him that hath fought such a Com∣bate for you, who <HI>hath trod the Wine-Press alone,</HI> and hath stained all his Garments with the Blood of thy Enemies; or is there any here who dare refuse his Salva¦tion, when they see how <HI>he treadeth his Enemies in Anger, and trampleth them in Fury,</HI> and thus <HI>sprinkleth their Blood upon his Garments.</HI> O tremble at this Sight, and seek Quarter from him in time, or he shall dy his Garments with the Blood of thy immortal Soul. Thirdly, Christ ap∣peareth unto his own, being cloathed with these humble Robes of Condescendency, when he came in <HI>the similitude of sinful Flesh</HI>: O what a Sight was that, to behold the Prince of Heaven cloathed with our Nature; What a Sight was that to behold him that was <HI>cloathed with Light as with a Garment,</HI> to be cloathed with <HI>our Infir∣mities,</HI> yet he condescended to cloath him∣self thus, that we might have access unto him, and be partakers of his Gifts: O can we refuse him, when love hath thus press∣ed him to put on the beggarly Weed that <HI>he might say to Worms, ye are my Brethren
<PB N="4" REF="003424_0006_0FF83C4394EDC5D8"/>
and my Sisters.</HI> Fourthly, Christ sometimes manifesteth himself, being cloathed with the Garments of Beauty, &amp; ravishing Ma∣jesty; such was the Sight that the Spouse got of Christ, Cant. 2.3. <HI>As the Apple tree among the Trees of the Wood, so is my Beloved among the Sons.</HI> And 5.10. when she saw him, <HI>White and rudy, and the stan∣dard-bearer of ten thousand,</HI> and when such was the joyful Sight of him, when his Gar∣ments were as Light, <HI>and white as the Snow,</HI> which he had at the Transfigurati∣on, when these glorified ones did come (as it were) Ambassadors from that high∣er House to make him a Visit. And fifth∣ly, Christ he sometimes appeareth to his own in Robes of dreadful Majesty, and terrible Highness and Loftiness, when the Soul upon the first Sight of him remains dead, and there remains no more Life in them: Such was the Sight <HI>Daniel</HI> got in his 10. Chapter. And such was the Sight that <HI>John</HI> got of Christ, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.17. And I would ask at all that are here, what a Sight have ye gotten of Christ to day, in which of all these Robes have ye seen him: It is true, we are not now to look for the extraordinary Sights of him; but yet if ever thou hast seen him in any of his woing Robes, surely he hath appeared Matchless, and how shall ye then refuse him.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003424_0007_0FF83C464B7096C0"/>But now to come to the Words I was speaking unto you of; The first thing in the Words, viz.</P>
<Q>That there are many who live under the Offer of this great Salvation that do slight it, and do not embrace it.</Q>
<P>And now, I shall only add a few things further unto you.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let me propose a few Considerations to <HI>perswade you to embrace the great Sal∣vation.</HI> God forbid we go away before we embrace this Gospel-Salvation: And therefore, I charge you in his Name, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not away before ye embrace it. And <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> press it home upon you, there are th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> eight or nine Properties of this great Sal∣vation, that is offered unto you this Day.</P>
<P>And first, <HI>It is a free Salvation,</HI> ye have no more ado, but to put forth your Hand and take it: O come and take it: Christ hath fought for this Salvation, and there is no more required of you, but to come and reap the Fruits of his Victory: <HI>Who∣ever will let him come,</HI> there is nothing that should move you to stay away, <HI>O Cap∣tives, Bond slaves to Satan, O Prisoners of Hope,</HI> will ye come and partake of the great Salvation, what holds you from coming away and partaking of it, it is free∣ly offered unto you: ay, believe it, Christ requires no more of you, but that ye should come and take it out of his Hand; <HI>if ye consent to obey,</HI> the Bargain is ended▪ <HI>Ye shall eat the good of the Land,</HI> Isai. 1.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003424_0008_0FF83C47D510D280"/>Secondly, This great Salvation, <HI>is a compleat Salvation,</HI> that is offered unto you to day; this is clear, Luke 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>1. <HI>That we might be saved from our Enemies, and from the Hand of all that hate us.</HI> There is not any Enemy that is in thy Way, but if thou will come and partake of the great Salvation, thou may have Victory over it, so compleat a Salvation is it that is in your Offer this Day. O shall we pass a∣way, and not embrace it: O shall our cursed Hearts undervalue <HI>compleat at Sal∣vation</HI> that is come to your Door, believe <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Salvation is near unto you,</HI> if ye will take <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>Thirdly, It is a <HI>wonderful Salvation,</HI> it is such a Salvation as to pry into it, and it is such a Salvation that all the Prophets desired to pry into it; It is almost six thou∣sand Years since all the Angels in Heaven fell into a Sea of Wonder at this great Sal∣vation: It is almost six thousand Years since <HI>Abel</HI> fell into a Sea of Wonder at this great Salvation: And what think ye is his Exercise this Day? He is even won∣dering at this great Salvation: Would ye ask at all the Angels in Heaven, would they not all say, O embrace the great Sal∣vation? Would ye ask at all the Saints that are above, would they not advise you to embrace the great Salvation? Would ye ask at <HI>Adam,</HI> would he not say, O em∣brace the great Salvation? Could ye ask at <HI>Abel,</HI> Would he not say, O embrace
<PB N="7" REF="003424_0009_0FF83C4A12EC21A8"/>
the great Salvation? And would not all the Patriarchs say unto you, O embrace the great Salvation? And do not all that have tasted of the Sweetness of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out unto you, Come and embrace the great Salvation.</P>
<P>The fourth Property of his Salvation is, that it was bought at an exceeding dear Rate, <HI>it is a dear Salvation.</HI> Would ye know the Difference between Christ's coming to this Salvation, and your coming to it, it is this: Christ was forced to tra∣vel through all the Armies of the Justice of God: He was forced to drink of the Cup of the Wrath of God, before he could come to purchase this great Salvati∣on; and now what is required of you to obtain this, we may say no more, but put out your Hands and take it: Will ye look to the Price that was laid down for this Salvation, there is not a Wound in the Body of Christ, but it is said, <HI>This is a dear Salvation.</HI> There is not a Reproach Christ met with, but it saith, <HI>O is not this a dear Salvation!</HI> There is not a buffeting Christ met with, but it saith, <HI>O is not this a dear Salvation</HI>! There is not a Necessi∣ty that he was put into, but it saith, <HI>Is not this a great and dear Salvation</HI>? O Sirs, will ye not come and take this great Salvation, this dear Salvation. What must I give for it say ye? I say, ye must give nothing for it, come and take it <HI>without Money, and without Price</HI>; it was dear un∣to
<PB N="8" REF="003424_0010_0FF83C4C512AB6E0"/>
Christ, but it shall be cheap unto you. O is it not cheap to you, I assure you, if ye will come to the Market to buy the great Salvation, there is none of you that needeth to stand for the Price of it. O come and take, and have it, and there shall be no more prigging.</P>
<P>Fifthly, It is <HI>an everlasting Salvation,</HI> that ye shall enjoy the Fruits of through∣out Eternity, as is clear, Heb. 9.13. <HI>He be∣came the Author of eternal Redemption unto us.</HI> It is a Salvation that the Devil can never be able to take out of your Hand, if ye take it, ye shall never be robbed of it again. O come and partake of this great Salvation, whereby the Gates of Hell shall never prevail against you.</P>
<P>Sixthly, It is <HI>a noble and honourable Sal∣vation,</HI> it is not to be taken out of one Slavery to another, but it is to be taken <HI>out of Prison that we may reign: Luke</HI> 1.71. compared with Verse 74. it is <HI>That we being saved, may serve him without Fear in Holiness and Righteousness, all the Days of our Life.</HI> I say, Come, come, and par∣take of this great Salvation, that your Glo∣ry may be increased, and that ye may be exalted above the Kings of the Earth.</P>
<P>Seventhly, It is a <HI>most advantageous Sal∣vation</HI> What are the Advantages of any Salvation that are not to be found in this? Is there not Peace to be found through this Salvation? Is there not Liberty to be found through this Salvation? Is there
<PB N="9" REF="003424_0011_0FF83C4EEA2CF388"/>
not eternal Enjoyment of God to be found in this Salvation? Yea, all Salvations are in this one Salvation.</P>
<P>Lastly, It is <HI>a royal Salvation,</HI> for it cometh to us from and through the Son of God. Christ is the Author of it, and we conceive, Christ may be said to be the Author of this Salvation, in these Respects, 1. He is the meritorious Cause that did procure it, it was the Price of his Blood that was laid down for to purchase this great Salvation. 2. He is the Fountain from whence it floweth, according to that Word which we have cited, Heb. 5.9. <HI>He is the Author of eternal Salvation.</HI> 3. He is the Person that fitteth our Spirits for partaking of it, and it is he that removeth Mountains out of the Way, that we may have fair Access unto the great Salvation. 4. It is he that must perswade our Hearts to embrace and to take hold of it. He standeth without, and cryeth in to the Heart, to embrace the great Salvation; And he standeth within, making the Heart cry out; <HI>Content,</HI> I will embrace the great Salvation: He is indeed the Person that commendeth, and doth point forth this great Salvation unto us, he is the noble Minister of it, it began first to be preached by him.</P>
<P>Now, Is there any of you that have fal∣len in love with the great Salvation? That ye may try your selves, I shall give you some Evidences of the Persons that are
<PB N="10" REF="003424_0012_0FF83C51CD1E8540"/>
near unto this great Salvation, 1. Is thy Estimation of the great Salvation increased, beyond what it was in the morning when thou came hither? Is thy Estimation of the great Gospel-Salvation a Foot higher than it was in the morning, I say unto thee, thou art not far from the great Sal∣vation: Come away. 2. Is thy desire af∣ter the great Salvation increased beyond what it was in the morning? Hast thou stronger Desires after the great Salvation than before thou came hither? That is an Evidence thou art not far from it. 3. Is <HI>thy Thoughts of thy Necessity</HI> of the great Salvation greater than they were? Think∣est thou that thou hast more need of the great Salvation than ever thou thoughtest before. And is thy Opinion and Thoughts of saving thy self less than they were before thou camest hither? Art thou forced to cry out, <HI>None but Christ can save me</HI>? I say thou art not far from the great Salvation, Will thou come away? O that ye would once seal this Conclusion with much Heart-Perswasion, <HI>I am undone without Christ, I am undone without Christ,</HI> who is the Author of the great Salvation: Are there any of you that are sensible that ye are in the Fetters of Sin, and in the Bonds of Iniquity? Are ye brought to the Conviction of this, that ye are in the Gall of Bitterness? I say, if thou be brought to this Length, to be sensible of thy Bonds, and art crying out, <HI>O Redeemer, hasten and
<PB N="11" REF="003424_0013_0FF83C5357F88D08"/>
come away!</HI> I say, if thou be sensible of thy Bonds and Imprisonment, and crying out, <HI>O thou that was anointed from Eter∣nity, to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Prison to them that are bound.</HI> O hasten and come away, and redeem me, <HI>even poor me,</HI> sinking, sinning, perishing, self-destroying <HI>me,</HI> thou art not far from the great Salvation. 4. Art thou a Person who beginneth to weep because thou hast been so long a Stranger to Christ, and the great Salvation? Old Men that are here, how long have ye been Stran∣gers to the great Salvation, and to the Author of it? Now will ye shed one Tear for your Estrangement, and cry out, Wo is me that Christ and I have been so long a∣sunder? I say, if thou hast: come to that Length, thou art not far from the great Salvation, <HI>Come away</HI>: O pity your selves, make haste and come away.</P>
<P>But now in the third Place, Let me give you some Evidences by which ye may know more clearly whether or no ye have embraced <HI>this great Salvation,</HI> that ye may know your selves, and that ye walk not down to the Grave with a Lie in your right hand. The first Evidence of a Person that hath embraced the great Salvation, is, that he will have a high E∣steem of the Saviour and Author of the great Salvation: Hast thou a matchless Esteem of matchless Christ the Saviour of the World, that is a speaking Evidence
<PB N="12" REF="003424_0014_0FF83C54E39DD028"/>
unto thee, thou art a Partaker of the great Salvation: Art thou come to this Length that thou criest out, <HI>None but Christ, None but Christ</HI>? It is a speaking Evidence that thou art come to be a Partaker of the great Salvation, when thou can cry out th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Word, Exod. 15.2. <HI>The Lord is my Strength and my Song, he alone is become my Salvation.</HI> If Christ hath become thy Sal∣vation then it is like he hath become thy Song. I would ask this of you, were ye ever brought this Length, that ye durst not adventure to praise Christ alone, but was forced to call in all the Creatures, and say, <HI>O magnify the Lord with me,</HI> O that is an Evidence that ye have embraced his Sal∣vation.</P>
<P>Secondly, Those who have embraced the great Salvation will study to maintain and keep their Hold of it, they will stu∣dy to hold fast so precious a Jewel, this is press'd, Gal. 5.1. <HI>Stand fast in the Li∣berty wherewith Christ hath made us free.</HI> Yea, they will study to walk suitably to to this noble Mercy, at least they will strive and endeavour to do it, as is also press'd in that same Verse. I say, if thou hast been made a Partaker of the Gospel of Salvation, thou wilt strive to keep thy self from the Power of these Things that once triumphed over thee.</P>
<P>Thirdly, A Person that is a Partaker of the great Salvation will have a high E∣steem of this Mercy and Salvation; so
<PB N="13" REF="003424_0015_0FF83C56F0571770"/>
<HI>Paul</HI> when he speaketh of it here, he can∣not but put some Note of Excellency to it, calling it, <HI>the great Salvation.</HI> Therefore, I say, if thou hast embraced the great Sal∣vation, thou wilt have so high Esteem of it, not to be subjected to it as thou should, or to be in Subjection to the Power of thy Lust in any Measure, will be his Burden and Affliction; the Man will be sorry when he is brought forth from the House of his Bondage, unto the Red-Sea; he will be sorry, that when he should have Songs of Triumph over his Idols put into his Mouth, that they should sing Songs of Triumph over him.</P>
<P>Fourthly. A Person that hath embraced the great Salvation, he will be longing sometimes for the Day when this Salvati∣on shall be compleat, when he shall sing that Song, with that <HI>numberous Multitude which cannot be numbered,</HI> Rev. 7.9. O what a Day shall it be, when thou shall begin to sing that Song: <HI>After this</HI> (saith he) <HI>I beheld, and lo, a great Multitude of all People, which no Man could number, of all People, Nations and Languages stood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with white Robes, and Palms in their Hands, and they cryed</HI>; and how cry∣ed they? <HI>They cryed with a loud Voice:</HI> they would not mutter the Song, nor sing silently, but <HI>cryed with a loud Voice:</HI> and what did they cry? they cryed with a loud Voice, <HI>Salvation unto our God, who
<PB N="14" REF="003424_0016_0FF83C5A1B082A80"/>
sitteth upon the Throne, and to the Lamb.</HI> I would only ask at you that are Partak∣ers of the great Salvation, What Songs shall be put into thy Mouth, when the Waters of <HI>Jordan</HI> shall divide themselves, <HI>that the ransomed of the Lord might pass thorow</HI>? when thou shall sing that Song, Psal. 115.1. <HI>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thee belongeth the Glory of our Salva∣tion.</HI> O what a Day shall that be, when that excellent Song shall be put in thy Mouth; yea, what a Day shall it be, when thou shalt be cloathed with these excel∣lent Garments that are made mention of, <HI>Isai.</HI> 6.10. for he hath cloathed thee with the <HI>Garments of Salvation,</HI> and he hath covered thee with the <HI>Robe of Righ∣teousness</HI> O what Robes are these? Did ye ever see such excellent Robes as these must be? I think we shall not know our selves; O do you not think we shall not know our selves, when we shall put on these excellent Robes? Now therefore, is the Bargain closed; or will ye go away before ye take this great Salvation? Dare ye go out at these Doors and neglect the great Salvation? I would ask this of you, Think ye it will not be most sad, that Christ should tell this in Heaven of you to night, I was preached to a pack of Stones, that none of them would love me? Will ye not be afraid that this Report shall be carried back to Heaven of you? For what Report can Christ carry back
<PB N="15" REF="003424_0017_0FF83C5BA4AF9DE8"/>
but this? Now is the Cord of this great Salvation let down unto you, is there none of you that will take a hold of it, O will ye seek after it, will ye make this a rejoycing Day in Heaven, that is a fast∣ing Day unto you, and the Way to make it so, is to embrace the great Salvation. Now what say ye to it old Men? Let me speak to you, and ask your Thoughts of the great Salvation, Gray Hairs should be a Crown of Glory, if it be found in the Way of Righteousness, old Men speak your Minds, that young Men may not have your bad Example: What say ye of this Salvation? Is it not a most glorious Salvation, is it not a most excellent Sal∣vation that is in your Offer? I intreat you speak your Minds, tell Christ ye are con∣tent to take the great Salvation; other∣wise, whoever he be that will not partake of this Gospel Salvation; I in the Name and Authority of Christ our Master, de∣nounce eternal and irrevocable War a∣gainst him. Put on your Harness, ye shall not boast when ye put it off again, the Wrath and Fury of God shall come upon you to the uttermost if ye embrace not this great Salvation: other Wars are but for a time: the greatest Captains that ever the Earth did carry, are now <HI>laid down in the sides of the Pit, and their Swords broken under their Heads.</HI> Armies of ten hundred thousand, a hundred Years Time have laid them all in their Graves, and ended all
<PB N="16" REF="003424_0018_0FF83C5ED8BB5838"/>
their Contests, but there is no Discharge of his War that shall be concluded be∣twixt Christ and you, it shall become an eternal and most terrible War, which shall be but beginning when Time is ended: Now Peace or War, which of them will ye choose? Dare ye send a Charge to Christ, and say ye will defy him? I am a∣fraid there will be two Things that many of us shall report to day. First, I am a∣fraid there will be many that will give <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Report to the offer of the great Salvation, and say, <HI>Who is the Lord that I should obey him</HI>? I tell you who he is, He is <HI>glorious in Holiness, fearful in Praises, doing Wonders.</HI> O embrace him before he go hence, and give not <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Re∣port, lest ye be drowned in the Sea of his Wrath, whence there shall be no Reco∣very.</P>
<P>Secondly, I fear there will be many here to day that will give <HI>Demas</HI>'s Re∣port to this precious Offer: I will go and forsake Christ, and embrace this pre∣sent World: O bad Exchange! cursed be he that shall make it, will ye be of <HI>De∣mas</HI>'s Humour? I fear there hath been many of that Humour of a long time: but I intreat you once to be wise before ye die. I confess that Proverb old Fools, are twice Fools; I think old Men that will not embrace the great Salvation, I think ye are triple Fools? What wait ye for? Is there any thing can afford you any Sa∣tisfaction
<PB N="17" REF="003424_0019_0FF83C61677837B0"/>
but this great Salvation? Now are ye convinced old Men, that Christ is waiting for your Answer? I intreat you before ye go hence, speak your minds, what ye think of the great Salvation; Is it not a lovely Salvation, is it not lovely now? What say ye to it? I am to go a∣way, and the Offer is to be taken up at this time, and it is hard to say if ever ye shall have an Offer again. I would only say this to you, and be sure of it, though I should never be a Partaker of this great Salvation, yet I shall be a Witness against you that are not Partakers of it; I tell and declare unto you, I shall be a Wit∣ness against you if ye embrace not the great Salvation: Now old Men are ye perswaded to embrace it, Let me obtest you <HI>by the Beauty of Christ,</HI> come and par∣take of the great Salvation, ye that are travelling upon the Borders of Eternity. Now if ye will give no more, give this, will ye go home and think upon it; I shall not be uncharitable, nor enter to judge your Thoughts: I fear there shall be many declared and found Guilty a∣mong us, that we declared unto Heaven we will not embrace the great Salvation, but have trod the Blood of the <HI>Son of God under Foot.</HI> Now I intreat you, every one of you ask at your selves if ye be the Per∣sons that will <HI>presume in your Hearts to do so.</HI> Now I shall leave it with you, let it not be a Witness against you. I shall
<PB N="18" REF="003424_0020_0FF83C62F47D39B0"/>
leave it with this. O come away, old Men, young Men, old Women, and Maids, come and embrace this precious Gospel Salvati∣on. Ye may say, ye bid us come; but we cannot come. I desire no more of you, but to come with this; Lord I am content to come, but I cannot come. Come once to that, for if once ye be content to receive it, it will not be long before ye be able to receive it: Now shall Christ depart, and will none of you say ye are content to take him? Will ye charge your own Con∣sciences with this, am I content to take Christ and the great Salvation. O blest, blest, blest, be he that is the Author of the great Salvation, and blest be he that gets any of the Ends of the Cord of the great Salvation, that we sink not under the Wrath and Fury of the Lord; Come and embrace this great Salvation, and again I say, come and embrace it: For what can ye want if ye have it? I shall say no more, but close with that Word, Isai. 62.21. <HI>Be∣hold, the Lord hath proclaimed to the Ends of the World, to those that are far off</HI>: what hath he proclaimed? <HI>Say ye to the Daugh∣ter of Sion, behold thy Salvation cometh, be∣hold it cometh.</HI> I say to you that are the Ends of the World, Salvation is brought near unto you: <HI>Stout-hearted and far from Righteousness,</HI> the great Salvation is brought near unto you, and will ye send it away? O consider what ye are doing. And to him that can perswade you to embrace the great salvation, we desire to give praise.</P>
