<HEAD><HI>UNTO</HI> CHARLES <HI>II. KING OF Great Britain, And the Dominions thereunto belonging: ROBERT BARCLAY,</HI> A Servant of JESUS CHRIST, called of GOD to the Dispensation of the Gos∣pel, now again Revealed, and after a long and dark Night of Apostacy, com∣manded to be Preached to all Nations, <HI>Wisheth Health and Salvation.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS the Condition of Kings and Princes puts them in a Station more obvious to the View and Observation of the World, than that of other Men, of whom (as <HI>Cicero</HI> observes) neither any Word or Action can be obscure; so
<PB REF="003129_0003_0FF003FA54463F20"/>
are those Kings (during whose appearance upon the Stage of this World, it pleaseth the Great <HI>KING</HI> of <HI>Kings</HI> singularly to make known un∣to Men the wounderful Steps of his <HI>Unsearchable Providence)</HI> more signally observed, and their Lives and Actions more diligently remarked and inquired into by Posterity; especially, if those things are such, as not only relate to the outward Transactions of this World, but also are signaliz∣ed by the Manifestation or Revelation of the Knowledge of God in matters Spiritual and Re∣ligious. These are the things that render'd the Lives of <HI>Cyrus, Augustus Caesar,</HI> and <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, in former Times, and of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, and some other Modern Princes in these last Ages, so Considerable.</P>
<P>But among all these Transactions, which it hath pleased God to permit, for the Glory of his Pow∣er, and the Manifestation of his Wisdom and Pro∣vidence, no Age furnisheth us with things so <HI>strange</HI> and <HI>marvellous,</HI> whether with respect to matters Civil or Religious, as these, that have fallen out within the compass of thy time; who, tho' thou be not yet arrived at the Fiftieth Year of thy Age, hast yet been a Witness of stranger things, than many Ages before produced. So that, whether we respect those various Troubles, where∣in thou found'st thy self ingaged, while scarce got out of thy Infancy; the many different Af∣flictions, wherewith Men of thy Circumstances are often unacquainted; the strange and unpa∣rallell'd Fortune that befel thy Father; thy own narrow Escape, and Banishment following there∣upon, with the great improbability of thy ever Returning, (at least without very much Pains, and tedious Combatings;) or finally, the incapa∣city
<PB REF="003129_0003_0FF003FA54463F20"/>
thou wert under to accomplish such a Design; considering the Strength of those that had posses∣sed themselves of thy Throne, and the Terror they had inflicted upon Foreign States: And yet that, after all this, thou should'st be Restored without Stroke of Sword, the help or assistance of Foreign States, or the contrivance and work of Humane Policy; all these do sufficiently declare, that it is the <HI>Lord's Doing</HI>; which, as it is marvellous in our Eyes, so it will justly be a matter of Wonder and Astonishment to Generations to come; and may sufficiently serve, if rightly observed, to confute and confound that <HI>Atheism,</HI> wherewith this Age doth so much abound.</P>
<P>As the Vindication of the <HI>Liberty of Conscience</HI> (which thy Father, by giving way to the impor∣tant Clamours of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> the answering and fulfilling of whose unrighteous Wills, has often proved hurtful and pernicious to Princes, sought in some part to restrain) was a great occasion of the Troubles and Revolutions; so the Pretence of <HI>Conscience</HI> was that which carried it on, and brought it to that pitch it came to. And tho' (no doubt) some, that were ingaged in that Work, designed good things, at least in the beginning, (albeit always wrong in the manner they took to accomplish it, <HI>viz.</HI> by Carnal Weapons;) yet so soon as they had tasted of the sweet of the Possessions of them they had turned out, they quickly began to do those things themselves, for which they had accused others. For their Hands were found full of Oppression, and <HI>they hated the Reproof of Instruction, which is the Way of Life:</HI> And they evilly intreated the Messengers of the Lord, and caused to beat and imprison his Prophets, and persecuted his People, whom he had called and
<PB REF="003129_0004_0FF003FD5B47EAD0"/>
gathered out from among them; whom he had made to beat their <HI>Swords into Plow-shares, and their Spears into Pruning-books,</HI> and not to learn <HI>Carnal War</HI> any more: But he raised them up, and armed them with <HI>Spiritual Weapons,</HI> even with his own Spirit and Power, whereby they testified in the Streets and High-ways, and publick Mar∣kets and Synagogues, against the <HI>Pride, Vanity, Lusts</HI> and <HI>Hypocrisie</HI> of that Generation, who were Righteous in their own Eyes; tho' often cruelly Entreated therefore: And they faithfully prophe∣sied and foretold them of their Judgment and Downfal, which came upon them; as by several Writings and Epistles, delivered to <HI>Oliver</HI> and <HI>Richard Cromwell,</HI> the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and other then <HI>Powers,</HI> yet upon Record, doth appear.</P>
<P>And after it pleased God to Restore thee, what Oppressions, what Banishments, and Evil Entreat∣ings they have met with, by Men pretending thy Authority, and cloaking their Mischief with thy Name, is known to most Men in this Island; espe∣cially in <HI>England,</HI> where there is scarce a Prison that hath not been filled with them; nor a Judge before whom they have not been haled: <HI>Though they could never yet be found Guilty</HI> of any things, that might deserve that Usage. Therefore the Sense of their Innocency did, no doubt, greatly con∣tribute to move thee, Three Years ago, to cause some Hundreds of them to be set at Liberty: For indeed their Sufferings are singular, and obviously distinguishable from all the rest of such as live un∣der thee, in these two respects.</P>
<P>First, <HI>In that among all the Plots, contrived by others against thee, since thy return into</HI> Britain, <HI>there was never any, owned of that People, found or known
<PB REF="003129_0004_0FF003FD5B47EAD0"/>
to be guilty,</HI> (though many of them have been taken and imprisoned upon such kind of Jealousies) <HI>but were always found Innocent and Harmless,</HI> (as became the Followers of Christ) <HI>not covering after, nor contending for the Kingdoms of this World; but subject to every Ordinance of Man, for Conscience sake.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>In that, in the bettest times of Perse∣cution, and the most violent Prosecution of those Laws made against Meetings</HI> (being cloathed with Inno∣cency) <HI>they have boldly stood to their Testimony for God, without creeping into Holes or Corners, or once biding themselves,</HI> as all other Dissenters have done; <HI>but daily met, according to their custom, in the publick places appointed for that end</HI>; so that none of thy Officers can say of them, <HI>That they have surprized them in a Corner, overtaken them in a private Conventicle, or catched them lurking in their secret Chambers; nor needed they to send out Spies to get them, whom they were sure daily to find in their open Assemblies, testifying for God and his Truth.</HI></P>
<P>By which, those that have an Eye to see, may observe their Christian Patience and Courage, Con∣stancy and Suffering, joyned in one, more than in any other People, that differ from them, or oppose them. And yet in the midst of all those Troubles, thou canst bear witness, That as on the one part, they never sought to detract from thee, or to render thee and thy Government odious to the People, by nameless and scandalous Pamphlets and Libels; so on the other hand, they have not spared to Admonish, Exhort and Reprove thee; and have faithfully discharged their Consciences towards thee, without Hattering Words, as ever
<PB REF="003129_0005_0FF004008309CD30"/>
the true Prophets in Ancient Times used to do to those Kings and Princes, under whose Power, Vio∣lence or Oppression was acted.</P>
<P>And albeit it is evident by Experience, to be most agreeable both to Divine Truth, and Humane Policy, to allow every one to serve God according to their Consciences; nevertheless those other Sects, who, for the most part, durst not peep out in the Times of Persecution, while these Innocent People stood bold and faithful, do now combine in a joynt Confederacy (notwithstanding all the former Janglings and Contentions among them∣selves) to render us odious; seeking unjustly to wrest our Doctrine and Words, as if they were both inconsistent with Christianity and Civil So∣ciety: So that to effectuate this their Work of Malice against us, they have not been ashamed to take the Help, and commend the Labours of some invidious <HI>Socinians</HI> against us. So do <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> agree to crucifie Christ.</P>
<P>But our Practice, known to thee by good Ex∣perience to be more consistent with Christianity and Civil Society, and the Peace and Welfare of this Island, than that of those that thus accuse us, doth sufficiently guard us against this Calumny; that we may indeed appeal to the Testimony of thy Conscience, as a Witness for us in the face of the Nations.</P>
<P>These things moved me to present the World with a Brief, but True Account of this People's Principles, in some short <HI>Theological Propositions</HI>; which, according to the Will of God, proving suc∣cessful, beyond my expectation, to the satisfaction of several, and to the moving in many a desire of
<PB REF="003129_0005_0FF004008309CD30"/>
being farther informed concerning us, as being every where evil spoken of, and likewise meeting with publick Opposition by some, as such will always do, so long as the <HI>Devil rules in the Children of Disobedience</HI>; I was thereby further ingaged, in the Liberty of the Lord, to present to the World this <HI>Apology</HI> of the Truth held by those People: Which, because of thy Interest in them, and theirs in thee, as having first appeared, and mostly increased in these Nations under thy Rule, I make bold to Present unto thee.</P>
<P>Thou knowest, and hast Experienced, <HI>their Faith∣fulness towards their God, their Patience in Suf∣fering, their Peaceableness towards the King, their Honesty, Plainness and Integrity in their faithful Warnings and Testimonies to thee</HI>; and if thou wilt allow thy self so much time as to read this, thou may'st find <HI>how Consonant their Principles are both to Scripture, Truth, and Right Reason.</HI> The Sim∣plicity of their Behaviour, the Generality of their Condition, as being Poor Men and Illiterate; the Manner of their Porcedure, being without the Wisdom and Policy of this World, hath made many conclude them Fools and Mad-Men; and neglect them, as not being capable of Reason. But tho' it be to them as their Crown, thus to be esteemed of the Wise, and Great and Learned of this World, and though they rejoyce to be accounted Fools for Christ's sake; yet of late, some, even such, who in the World's account are esteemed both Wise and Learned, begin to judge otherwise of them, and find, that they hold forth things very agree∣able both to Scriptue, Reason, and true Learning.</P>
<P>As it is inconsistent with the Truth I bear, so it is far from me to use this Epistle as an Engine
<PB REF="003129_0006_0FF00402F7470810"/>
to <HI>flatter</HI> thee, the usual design of such Works; and therefore I can neither Dedicate it to thee, nor crave thy Patronage, as if thereby I might have more Confidence to present it to the World, or be more hopeful of its success. To God alone I owe what I have, and that more immediately in Matters Spiritual; and therefore to him alone, and to the Service of his Truth, I dedicate what∣ever Work he brings forth in me: To whom only the Praise and Honour appertains, whose Truth needs not the Patronage of Worldly Princes; his Arm and Power being that alone, by which it is Propagated, Established and Confirmed. But I found it upon my Spirit, to take occasion to Pre∣sent this Book unto thee; that as thou hast been often warned by several of that People, who are Inhahitants of <HI>England</HI>; so thou may'st not want a seasonable Advertisement, from a Member of thy Ancient Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI>; and that thou may'st know (which I hope thou shalt have no reason to be troubled at) that God is raising up and in∣creasing that people in that Nation. And the Na∣tions shall also hereby know, that the <HI>Truth</HI> we profess, is not a Work of Darkness, nor propagated by stealth; and that we are not ashamed of the <HI>Gospel of Christ,</HI> because we know it to be the <HI>Power of God to Salvation</HI>; and that we are no ways so inconsistent with Government, nor such Distur∣bers of the Peace, as our Enemies, by traducing us, have sought to make the World believe we are: For which, to thee I dare appeal, as a Wit∣ness of our Peaceableness and Christian Patience.</P>
<P>Generations to come shall not more admire that singular step of Divine Providence, in Restoring thee to thy Throne, without outward Bloodshed, than they shall admire the Increase and Progress
<PB REF="003129_0006_0FF00402F7470810"/>
of this <HI>Truth,</HI> without all outward Help, and against so great Opposition; which shall be none of the least things rendring thy <HI>Memory</HI> Remarkable.</P>
<P>God hath done great things for thee, he hath sufficiently shewn thee, That it is <HI>by Him Princes rule,</HI> and that <HI>He can pull down and set up at his pleasure.</HI> He hath often faithfully warned thee by his Servants, since he Restored thee to thy <HI>Royal Dignity,</HI> that thy Heart might not wax wan∣ton against him, to forget his Mercies and Provi∣dences towards thee; whereby he might permit thee to be soothed up, and lulled asleep in thy Sins, by the Flattering of <HI>Court-Parasites,</HI> who by their fawning, are the <HI>Ruine</HI> of many <HI>Princes.</HI></P>
<P>There is no King in the World, who can so Ex∣perimentally testifie of God's Providence and Goodness; neither is there any, who rules so many free People, so many true Christians: Which thing renders thy Government more Honourable, thy Self more Considerable, than the Accession of many Nations, filled with slavish and superstitious Souls.</P>
<P>Thou hast tasted of Prosperity and Adversity; thou know'st what it is to be Banished thy Native Country, to be Over ruled, as well as to Rule, and sit upon the Throne; and being <HI>oppressed,</HI> thou hast reason to know how <HI>hateful</HI> the <HI>Oppressor</HI> is, both to God and Man: If after all these Warnings and Advertisements, thou dost not turn unto the Lord with all thy Heart; but forget him, who remem∣bered thee in thy distress, and give up thy Self to follow Lust and Vanity; surely great will be thy Condemnation.</P>
<P>Against which Snare, as well as the Temptation of those, that may or do feed thee, and prompt

<P>FOrasmuch as that, which above all things I propose to my self, is to Declare and Defend the <HI>Truth;</HI> for the Service whereof I have given up and devoted myself, and all that is mine: Therefore there is nothing which for its sake (by the help and assistance of God) I may not attempt. And in this Confidence, I did some time ago publish certain Propositions of Divinity, comprehending briefly the chief Principles and Doctrines of <HI>Truth;</HI> which, appearing not unprofitable to some, and being, beyond my Expectation, well received both by Foreigners, tho' dissenting from us, (albeit also opposed by some Envious Ones) did so far pre∣vail, as in some part to remove that false and monstrous Opinion, which Lying Fame, and the Malice of our Adver∣saries, had implanted in the Minds of some, concerning us and our Doctrines. In this respect it seem'd to me not fit to spare my Pains and Labour.</P>
<P>Therefore, being acted by the same measure of the Di∣vine Spirit, and the like design of Propagating the Truth, by which I published the Propositions, I judg'd it meet to explain them somewhat more largely at this time, and defend them by certain Arguments.</P>
<P>Perhaps my Method of Writing may seem not only dif∣ferent, but even contrary, to that which is commonly used by the Men called <HI>Divines,</HI> with which I am not con∣cerned: For that I confess my self to be not only no Imi∣tator and Admirer of the <HI>School Men,</HI> but an Opposer and Despiser of them, as such; by whose Labour I judge the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> is so far from being bettered, that it is rather destroyed. Neither have I sought to accom∣modate this my Work to itching Ears, who desire rather to comprehend in their Heads the sublime Notions of Truth, than to imbrace it in their Hearts: For what I have writ∣ten comes more from my Heart than from my Head; what I have heard with the Ears of my Soul, and seen with my
<PB N="2" REF="003129_0008_0FF004079BA6EF08"/>
inward Eyes, and my Hands have handled of the <HI>Word of Life;</HI> and what hath been inwardly manifested to me of the things of God, that do I declare; not so much minding the Eloquence and Excellency of Speech, as de∣siring to demonstrate the Efficacy &amp; Operation of Truth; and if I err sometimes in the former, it is no great mat∣ter; for I act not here the <HI>Grammarian,</HI> or the <HI>Orator,</HI> but the <HI>Christian;</HI> and therefore in this I have followed the certain Rule of the <HI>Divine Light,</HI> and of the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>And to make an end; What I have written, is written not to feed the <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Knowledge,</HI> or rather <HI>vain Pride of this World,</HI> but to starve and oppose it, as the little Preface prefix'd to the <HI>Propositions</HI> doth shew; which, with the Title of them, is as followeth.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 11.27.</NOTE>Seeing <HI>no Man knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son revealeth him</HI>; and seeing <HI>the Re∣velation of the Son is in and by the Spirit</HI>; therefore the Testimony of the Spirit is that alone, by which the true Knowledge of God hath been, is, and can be only revealed; who, as by the Moving of his own Spirit, converted the <HI>Chaos</HI> of this World into that wonderful Order, wherein it was in the begin∣ning, and created Man a Living Soul, to rule and govern it; so by the Revelation of the same Spirit, he hath manifested himself all along unto the Sons of Men, both Patriarchs, Prophets and Apostles; which Revelations of God by the Spirit, whether by outward Voices and Appearances, Dreams, or inward <HI>objective Manifestations in the Heart,</HI> were of old the <HI>formal Object</HI> of their Faith, and remaineth yet so to be; <HI>since the Object of the Saints Faith is the same in all Ages,</HI> tho' set forth under divers Ad∣ministrations. Moreover, these divine Inward Re∣velations, which we make absolutely necessary for the Building up of True Faith, neither do nor can ever contradict the outward Testimony of the Scriptures, or right and sound Reason. Yet from hence it will not follow, that these Divine Revela∣tions are to be subjected to the Examination, either of the outward Testimony of the Scriptures, or of the Natural Reason of Man, as to a more noble or certain Rule or Touchstone: For this Divine Re∣velation, and Inward Illumination, is that which is evident and clear of it self, forcing by its own evi∣dence and clearness, the Well-disposed Understand∣ing to assent, irresistably moving the same there∣unto, even as the common Principles of Natural <HI>Truths</HI> move and incline the Mind to a natural assent: (Such as are these, That <HI>the whole is greater than the

parts</HI>; that <HI>two contradictory Sayings cannot be both true, or false</HI>) which is also manifest according to our Adversaries Principle, who (supposing the possibi∣lity of Inward Divine Revelations) will neverthe∣less confess with us, that neither Scripture nor sound Reason will contradict it: And yet it will not follow, according to them, that the Scripture, or sound Reason, should be subjected to the Exa∣mination of the Divine Revelations in the Heart.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The Third Proposition.</HI> Concerning the Scriptures.</HEAD>
<P>From these Revelations of the Spirit of God to the Saints, have proceeded the Scriptures of Truth, which contain, 1. A faithful Historical Account of the Actings of God's People in divers Ages, with many singular and remarkable Providences attend∣ing them. 2. A Prophetical Account of several things, whereof some are already past, and some yet to come. 3. A full and ample Account of all the chief Principles of the Doctrine of Christ, held forth in divers precious Declarations, Exhortations and Sentences, which, by the Moving of God's Spi∣rit, were at several times, and upon sundry occasions, spoken and written unto some Churches and their Pastors. Nevertheless, because they are only a De∣claration of the <HI>Fountain,</HI> and not the <HI>Fountain</HI> it self, therefore they are not to be esteemed the Principal Ground of all Truth and Knowledge, nor yet the <HI>adequate primary Rule</HI> of <HI>Faith and Manners.</HI> Nevertheless, as that which giveth a true and faith∣ful Testimony of the first Foundation, they are and may be esteemed a <HI>secondary Rule, subordinate</HI> to the <HI>Spirit,</HI> from which they have all their excellency and certainty; for as by the Inward Testimony of the Spirit we do alone truly know them, so they testi∣fie, that the Spirit is that Guide, by which the Saints are led into <HI>All Truth</HI>; therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 16.13 Rom. 8.14.</NOTE> according to the
<PB N="6" REF="003129_0010_0FF0040E5B705A60"/>
Scriptures, the Spirit is the first and principal Leader. And seeing we do therefore receive and believe the Scriptures, because they proceeded from the Spirit, therefore also the Spirit is more origi∣nally and principally the Rule, according to that received Maxim in the Schools, <HI>Propter quod unum∣quodque est tale, illud ipsum est magis tale.</HI> Englished thus: <HI>That for which a thing is such, that thing it self is more such.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>PROPOSITION I.</HI> Seeing the heighth of all Happiness is placed in the true Knowledge of God, <HI>(this is Life Eternal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John 17.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> <HI>to know the true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent)</HI> the true and right Understanding of this Foun∣dation and ground of Knowledge, is that which is most necessary to be known and believed in the first place.</HEAD>
<P>HE that desireth to acquire any Art or Science, seeketh first those Means, by which that Art or Science is obtained: If we ought to do so in things Natural and Earthly, how much more then in Spiritual? In this Affair then should our Inquiry be the more diligent, because he that errs in the En∣trance, is not so easily reduced again into the right Way; he that misseth his Road from the Beginning of his Journey, and is deceived in his first Marks, at his first setting forth, the greater his Mistake is, the more difficult will be his Entrance into the right Way.</P>
<P>Thus when a Man first proposeth to himself the Knowledge of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Way to the true Knowledge of God.</NOTE> from a Sense of his own Un∣worthiness, and from the great Weariness of his Mind, occasioned by the secret Checks of his Con∣science,
<PB N="16" REF="003129_0015_0FF0041A0C495ED8"/>
and the tender yet real Glances of God's <HI>Light</HI> upon his Heart; the earnest Desires he has to be redeemed from his present Trouble, and the fer∣vent Breathings he has to be eased of his disordered Passions and Lusts, and to find quietness and peace in the certain Knowledge of God and in the Assu∣rance of his Love and Good-will towards him, makes his Heart tender, and ready to receive any Impression; and so (not having then a distinct dis∣cerning) through forwardness imbraceth any thing that brings present Ease. If either through the Re∣verence he bears to certain Persons, or from the secret Inclination to what doth comply with his Natural Disposition, he fall upon any Principles or Means, by which he apprehends he may come to know God, and so doth center himself, it will be hard to remove him thence again, how wrong so∣ver they may be: For the first Anguish being over, he becomes more hardy; and the Enemy being near, creates a false Peace, and a certain Confidence, which is strengthed by the Mind's unwillingness, to enter again into new doubtfulness, or the former anxiety of a Search.</P>
<P>This is sufficiently verified in the Example of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> and <HI>Jewish Doctors,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jewish Do∣ctors and Pharisees resist Christ.</NOTE> who most of all resisted <HI>Christ,</HI> disdaining to be esteemed Ignorant; for this vain Opinion they had of their Knowledge, hinder∣ed them from the true Knowledge; and the mean People, who were not so much pre-occupied with former Principles, nor conceited of their own Know∣ledge, did easily believe: Wherefore the <HI>Pharisees</HI> up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raid them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 7.48, 49.</NOTE> saying, <HI>Have any of the Rulers or Pha∣risees believed on him? But This People, which know not the Law, are accursed.</HI> This is also abundantly pro∣ved by the Experience of all such, as being secretly touched with the Call of God's Grace unto them, do apply themselves to false Teachers, where the Remedy proves worse than the Disease; because, instead of knowing God, or the things relating to
<PB N="17" REF="003129_0015_0FF0041A0C495ED8"/>
their Salvation aright, they drink in wrong Opi∣nions of him; from which it's harder to be dis∣intangled, than while the Soul remains a Blank, or <HI>Tabula rasa.</HI> For they that conceit themselves Wise, are worse to deal with, than they that are sensible of their Ignorance. Nor hath it been less the device of the Devil, the great Enemy of Man∣kind, to perswade Men into wrong Notions of God, than to keep them altogether from acknowledging him; the latter taking with few, because odious; but the other having been the constant Ruine of the World; For there hath scarce been a Nation found, but hath had some Notions or other of Re∣ligion; so that not from their denying any Deity, but from their Mistakes and Misapprehensions of it, hath proceeded all the Idolatry and Superstition of the World; yea, hence even Atheism it self hath proceeded: For these many and various Opinions of God and Religion, being so much mixed with the Guessings and uncertain Judgments of Men, have begotten in many the opinion, That there is no God at all. This and much more that might be said, may shew how dangerous it is to miss in this first step: <HI>All that come not in by the right Door, are</HI> accounted as <HI>Thieves and Robbers.</HI></P>

<PB N="19" REF="003129_0016_0FF0041BB54A3640"/>
same thereunto, even as the common Principles of na∣tural Truths do move and incline the Mind to a na∣tural Assent: As, <HI>That the whole is greater than its part; That two Contradictories can neither be both true, nor both false.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">§. I. IT is very probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revelati∣ons by Apostate Christians rejected</NOTE> that many carnal and natural Christians will oppose this Propo∣sition; who, being wholly unacquainted with the Movings and Actings of God's Spirit upon their Hearts, judge the same nothing necessary; and some are apt to flout at it as ridiculous: Yea, to that height are the generality of Christians apostati∣zed and degenerated, that tho' there be not any thing more plainly Asserted, more seriously Recom∣mended, or more certainly Attested to, in all the Writings of the holy Scriptures; yet nothing is less minded, and more rejected, by all sorts of Chri∣stians, than <HI>Immediate and Divine Revelation</HI>; in so much, that once to lay claim to it, is matter of Reproach. Whereas of old, none were ever judged Christians, but such as <HI>had the Spirit of Christ,</HI> Rom. 8.9. But now many do boldly call themselves <HI>Chri∣stians,</HI> who make no difficulty of confessing they are without it, and laugh at such as say they have it. Of old they were accounted <HI>the Sons of God, who were led by the Spirit of God,</HI> ibid. vers. 14. But now many aver themselves Sons of God, who know nothing of this Leader; and he that affirms himself so led, is, by the pretended Orthodox of this Age, presently proclaimed a Heretick. The reason hereof is very manifest, <HI>viz.</HI> Because many in these days, under the Name of <HI>Christians,</HI> do experimentally find, that they are not acted nor led by God's Spirit; yea, many great <HI>Doctors, Divines, Teachers</HI> and <HI>Bishops</HI> of Christianity (com∣monly so called) have wholly shut their Ears from hearing, and their Eyes from seeing thiS <HI>Inward Guide,</HI> and so are become strangers unto it; whence
<PB N="20" REF="003129_0017_0FF0041F1668ADD8"/>
they are, by their own Experience, brought to this Strait, either to confess that they are as yet ignorant of God, and have only the shadow of <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and not the true <HI>Knowledge</HI> of him, or that this <HI>Knowledge</HI> is acquired without Immediate Revelation.</P>
<P>For the better understanding then of this Propo∣sition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Knowledge Spiritual and Literal distin∣guished.</NOTE> we do distinguish betwixt the certain Know∣ledge of God and the uncertain; betwixt the spi∣ritual Knowledge, and the literal; the saving heart-Knowledge, and soaring, airy head-Knowledge. The last, we confess, may be divers ways obtained; but the first, by no other way, than the inward im∣mediate Manifestation and Revelation of God's Spi∣rit, shining in and upon the Heart, inlightning and opening the Understanding.</P>
<P N="2">§. II. Having then proposed to my self, in these Propositions, to affirm those things which relate to the true and effectual Knowledge, which brings Life Eternal with it; therefore I have affirmed, and that truly, that this Knowledge is no other ways attain∣ed, and that none have any true ground to believe they have attained it, who have it not by this Re∣velation of God's Spirit.</P>
<P>The certainty of which Truth is such, that it hath been acknowledged by some of the most refined and famous of all sorts of Professors of Christianity in all Ages; who being truly upright-hearted, and earnest seekers of the Lord, (however stated under the disadvantages and epidemical Errors of their several Sects or Ages) the true Seed in them hath been answered by God's Love, who hath had regard to the Good, and hath had of his Elect Ones among all, who finding a distaste and disgust in all other outward Means, even in the very Principles and Pre∣cepts more particularly relative to their own Forms and Societies, have at last concluded, with <HI>One Voice,</HI> That there was no true Knowledge of God, but that which is revealed inwardly by his own Spirit.

<P>Which also the more Serious to this Day do ac∣knowledge, even all such, who satisfie themselves not with the Superfice of Religion, and use it not as a Cover or Art. Yea, all those, who apply them∣selves effectually to Christianity, and are not satis∣fied until they have found its effectual Work upon their Hearts, redeeming them from Sin, do feel that no Knowledge effectually prevails, to the pro∣ducing of this, but that which proceeds from the warm Influence of God's Spirit upon the Heart, and from the comfortable shining of his Light up∣on their Understanding. And therefore to this purpose a late Modern Author saith well, (<HI>videlice<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Dr. <HI>Smith</HI> of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> in his Select Discourses)
<Q>To seek our Divinity meerly in Books and Writings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Smith</HI> of <HI>Cam∣bridge,</HI> con∣cerning Book-Divi∣nity.</NOTE> is to seek the Living among the Dead; we do but in vain many times seek God in these, where his Truth is too often not so much enshrined as entombed. <HI>Intra te quaere Deum,</HI> Seek God within thine own Soul; He is best discerned <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (as <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinus</HI> phraseth it) <HI>by an Intellectual Touch of him,</HI> We must <HI>see with our Eyes, and hear with our Ears, and our Hands must handle the Word of Life,</HI> (to ex∣press it in St. <HI>John</HI>'s Words) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, &amp;c. The Soul itself hath its Sense as well as the Body. And therefore <HI>David,</HI> when he would teach us to know what the Divine Goodness is, calls not for Speculation, but Sensation: <HI>Taste, and see how
<PB N="24" REF="003129_0019_0FF00422EE319F60"/>
good the Lord is.</HI> That is not the best and truest Knowledge of God, which is wrought out by the Labour and Sweat of the Brain, but that which is kindled within us, by an heavenly Warmth in our Hearts. <HI>And again,</HI>: There is a Knowledge of the <HI>Truth, as it is in Jesus,</HI> as it is in a <HI>Christ-like Nature</HI>; as it is in that sweet, mild, humble and loving Spirit of Jesus, which spreads it self, like a Morning Star, upon the Spirits of good Men, full of Light and Life. It profits little to know Christ himself after the Flesh; but he gives his Spirit to good Men, <HI>that searcheth the deep things of God. And again:</HI> It is but a thin airy Know∣ledge, that is got by meer Speculation, which is usher'd in by Syllogisms and Demonstrations; but that which springs forth from true Goodness, is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> (as <HI>Origen</HI> speaketh) <HI>It brings such a Divine Light to the Soul, as is more clear and convincing than any Demonstration.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="3"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apostacy and a false Knowledge introduced</NOTE>§. III. That this certain and undoubted Method of the true Knowledge of God hath been brought out of Use, hath been none of the least Devices of the Devil, to secure Mankind to his Kingdom. For after the Light and Glory of the Christian Religion had prevailed over a good Part of the World, and dispelled the thick Mists of the Heathenish Doctrine of the Plurality of Gods, he that knew there was no Probability of deluding the World any longer that way, did then puff Man up with a false Know∣ledge of the true God; setting him on work to seek God the wrong way, and perswading him to be content with such a Knowledge as was of his own acquiring, and not of God's teaching. And this Device hath proved the more successful, because accommodated to the natural and corrupt Spirit and Temper of Man, who above all things affects to exalt himself, in which Exaltation, as God is greatly dishonoured, so therein the Devil hath his end; who is not anxious how much God is acknow∣ledged
<PB N="25" REF="003129_0019_0FF00422EE319F60"/>
in Words, provided himself be but always served; he matters not how great and high Specu∣lations the Natural Man entertains of God, so long as he serves his Lusts and Passions, and is obedient to his evil Suggestions and Temptations. Thus <HI>Christianity</HI> is become an Art,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christiani∣ty is be∣come an Art, ac∣quired by humane Science and Industry.</NOTE> acquired by humane Science and Industry, as any other Art or Science is; and Men have not only assumed unto themselves the Name of <HI>Christians,</HI> but even have procured to be esteemed as <HI>Masters of Christianity,</HI> by certain Arti∣ficial Tricks, tho' altogether Strangers to the Spirit and Life of Jesus. But if we shall make a right De∣finition of a <HI>Christian,</HI> according to the Scripture, <HI>videlicet,</HI> That <HI>he is one that hath the Spirit, and is led by it:</HI> How many <HI>Christians,</HI> yea, and of those great <HI>Masters and Doctors of Christianity,</HI> so accounted, shall we justly divest of that noble Title?</P>
<P>If then such as have all the other Means of Know∣ledge, and are sufficiently learned therein, whether it be the Letter of the Scripture, the Traditions of Churches, the Works of Creation and Providence, whence they are able to deduce strong and undeni∣able Arguments (which may be true in themselves) are not yet to be esteemed <HI>Christians,</HI> according to the certain and infallible Definition above mentioned: And if the inward and immediate Revelation of God's Spirit in the Heart, in such as have been altogether ignorant of some, and but very little skilled in others, of these Means of attaining Know∣ledge, hath brought them to Salvation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">By Revela∣tion is the true Know∣ledge of God.</NOTE> then it will necessarily and evidently follow, that Inward and Immediate Revelation is the only sure and certain Way to attain the true and saving Knowledge of God.</P>
<P>But the first is true: Therefore the last.</P>
<P>Now as this Argument doth very strongly con∣clude for this Way of Knowledge, and against such as deny it; so herein it is the more considerable, because the Propositions, from which it is deduced,
<PB N="26" REF="003129_0020_0FF0042498AEE0D0"/>
are so clear, that our very Adversaries cannot deny them. For, as to the first, it is acknowledged, that many Learned Men may be, and have been, damned. And as to the second, who will deny but many illiterate Men may be, and are, saved? Not dare any affirm, that none come to the Knowledge of God and Salvation by the inward Revelation of the Spirit, without these other outward Means; unless they be also so bold as to exclude <HI>Abel, Seth, Noah, Abraham,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Abel, Seth, Noah, <HI>&amp;c. infra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Job,</HI> and all the holy Patriarchs from true Knowledge and Salvation.</P>
<P N="4">§. IV. I would however not be understood, as if hereby I excluded those other Means of Knowledge, from any use or service to Man; it is far from me so to judge, as in the next Proposition, concerning the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> shall more plainly appear. The Que∣stion is not, what may be profitable or helpful but what is absolutely necessary. Many things may con∣tribute to further a Work, which yet are not that main Thing that makes the Work go on.</P>
<P>The Sum then of what is said, amounts to this, That where the true Inward Knowledge of God is, through the Revelation of his Spirit, there is all; neither is there an absolute necessity of any other. But where the best, highest, and most profound Knowledge is, without this there is nothing, as to the obtaining the great End of Salvation. This Truth is very effectually confirmed by the first part of the Proposition it self, which in few words com∣prehendeth divers unquestionable Arguments, which I shall in brief subsume.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="I"/> First, <HI>That there is no Knowledge of the</HI> Father <HI>but by the</HI> Son.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="II"/> Secondly, <HI>That there is no Knowledge of the</HI> Son, <HI>but by the</HI> Spirit.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="III"/> Thirdly, <HI>That by the</HI> Spirit <HI>God hath always revealed himself to his Children.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="IV"/> Fourthly, <HI>That these Revelations were the</HI> formal Object of the Saints Faith.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="003129_0020_0FF0042498AEE0D0"/>
<P>And Lastly, <HI>That the same continueth to be the</HI> <MILESTONE N="V"/> Object of the Saints Faith to this Day.</P>
<P>Of each of these I shall speak a little particularly, and then proceed to the latter Part.</P>
<P N="5">§. V. As to the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assert. <HI>I.</HI> Proved.</NOTE> <HI>viz. That there is no Know∣ledge of the</HI> Father <HI>but by the</HI> Son, it will not need much Probation, being founded upon the Plain Words of Scripture, and is therefore a fit <HI>Medium</HI> to draw the rest of our Assertions from.</P>
<P>For the infinite and most wise God, who is the Foun∣dation, Root &amp; Spring of all Operation, hath wrought all things by his Eternal Word and Son.<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 1.1, 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>This is that</HI> WORD, <HI>that was in the beginning with God, and was God, by whom all things were made, and without whom was not any thing made that was made.</HI> This is that <HI>Je∣sus Christ, by whom God created all things, by whom,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 3.9.</NOTE> <HI>and for whom, all things were created, that are in Heaven and in Earth, visible and invisible, whether they be Thrones, or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers,</HI> Col. 1.16. Who therefore is called, <HI>The first born of every Crea∣ture,</HI> Col. 1.15. As then, that infinite and incom∣prehensible Fountain of Life and Motion, operateth in the Creatures, by his own Eternal Word and Power; so no Creature has access again unto him, but in and by the Son, according to his own ex∣press Words, <HI>No man knoweth the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him,</HI> Matth. 11.27. Luke 10.22. And again, he himself saith, <HI>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life: No man cometh unto the Father but by me,</HI> John 14.6.</P>
<P>Hence he is fitly called <HI>The Mediator betwixt God and Man:</HI> For having been with God from all Eternity, being himself God, and also in time par∣taking of the Nature of Man; through him is the Goodness and Love of God convey'd to Mankind, and by him again Man receiveth and partaketh of these Mercies.</P>
<P>Hence is easily deduced the Probation of this first Assertion, thus:</P>
<PB N="28" REF="003129_0021_0FF0042716DDC668"/>
<P>If no Man knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him; then there is no knowledge of the Father, but by the Son.</P>
<P>But, no Man knoweth the Father but the Son.</P>
<P>Therefore, there is no knowledge of the Father but by the Son.</P>
<P>The first part of the antecedent are the plain words of Scripture: The consequence thereof is undeniable; except one would say, that he hath the knowledge of the Father, while yet he knows him not; which were an absurd Repugnance.</P>
<P>Again, If the Son be the Way, the Truth, and the Life, and that no Man cometh unto the Father but by him; then there is no knowledge of the Fa∣ther but by the Son.</P>
<P>But the first is true: Therefore the last.</P>
<P>The antecedent are the very Scripture words. The consequence is very evident: For how can any know a thing, who useth not the way, without which it is not knowable? But it is already proved, that there is no other way, but by the Son; so that whoso uses not that way, cannot know him, neither come unto him.</P>
<P N="6"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Assert.</HI> II.</NOTE>§. VI. Having then laid down this first Principle, I come to the second,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proved.</NOTE> <HI>viz. That there is no Knowledge of the Son but by the Spirit</HI>; or, <HI>That the Revelation of the Son of God, is by the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Where it is to be noted, that I always speak of the saving, certain and necessary Knowledge of God, which that it cannot be acquired otherways than by the Spirit, doth also appear from many clear Scriptures. For Jesus Christ, in and by whom the Father is revealed, doth also reveal himself to his Disciples and Friends, in and by his Spirit; as his Manifestation was sometimes outward, when he testified and witnessed for the Truth in this World, and approved himself faithful throughout: So be∣ing now withdrawn, as to the outward Man, he doth teach and instruct Mankind inwardly, by his
<PB N="29" REF="003129_0021_0FF0042716DDC668"/>
own Spirit; <HI>He standeth at the door and knocketh, and whoso beareth his Voice and openeth, he comes in</HI> to such, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.20. Of this Revelation of Christ in him, <HI>Paul</HI> speaketh, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.16. in which he placeth the Excellency of his Ministry, and the Certainty of his Calling. And the Promise of Christ to his Disciples, <HI>Lo, I am with you to the end of the World,</HI> confirmeth the same thing; for this is an inward Presence and Spiritual, as all acknowledge: But what relates hereto will again occur. I shall deduce the Proof of this Proposition from two ma∣nifest places of Scripture: The first is, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.11,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Proof</HI> 1.</NOTE> 12. <HI>What Man knoweth the things of a Man save the Spirit of Man which is in him? Even so the things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Things of <HI>God</HI> are known by the Spirit of <HI>God.</HI></NOTE> <HI>that we might know the things which are freely given us of God.</HI> The Apostle in the verses before, speaking of the wonderful things which are prepared for the Saints, after he hath declared, that <HI>the Natural Man cannot reach them,</HI> adds, that <HI>They are revealed by the Spirit of God,</HI> vers. 9, 10. giving this reason, <HI>For the Spirit search∣eth all things, even the deep things of God.</HI> And then he bringeth in the comparison, in the verses above∣mentioned very apt, and answerable to our Purpose and Doctrine, that <HI>as the things of a Man are only known by the Spirit of Man; so the things of God are only known by the Spirit of God:</HI> That is, that as no∣thing below the Spirit of Man (as the Spirit of Brutes, or any other Creatures) can properly reach unto, or comprehend the things of a Man, as being of a nobler and higher Nature; so neither can the Spirit of Man, or the Natural Man, as the Apostle in the 14th Verse subsumes, receive nor discern the things of God, or the things that are Spiritual, as being also of a higher Nature; which the Apostle himself gives for the reason, saying, <HI>Neither can he know them because they are Spiritually discerned.</HI> So
<PB N="30" REF="003129_0022_0FF004290A8705C8"/>
that, the Apostles words being reduced to an Ar∣gument, do very well prove the matter under De∣bate, thus:</P>
<P>If that which appertaineth properly to Man, can∣not be discerned by any lower or baser Principle, than the Spirit of Man; then cannot these things, that properly relate unto God and Christ, be known or discerned by any lower or baser thing, than the Spirit of God and Christ.</P>
<P>But the First is true: Therefore also the Second.</P>
<P>The whole strength of the Argument is contain∣ed in the Apostle's words before-mentioned; which therefore being granted, I shall proceed to deduce a second Argument, thus:</P>
<P>That which is Spiritual, can only be known and discerned by the Spirit of God.</P>
<P>But the Revelation of Jesus Christ, and the true and saving Knowledge of him, is Spiritual:</P>
<P>Therefore the Revelation of Jesus Christ, and the true and saving Knowledge of him, can on∣ly be known and discerned by the Spirit of God.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="II"/> <NOTE PLACE="marg">No Man can call Jesus Lord, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>The other Scripture is also a Saying of the same Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.3. <HI>No Man can say, that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</HI> The Scripture, which is full of Truth, and answereth full well to the inlightned Understanding of the spiritual and real Christian, may perhaps prove very strange to the carnal and pretended Follower of Christ, by whom perhaps it hath not been so diligently re∣marked. Here the Apostle doth so much require the Holy Spirit, in the things that relate to a Chri∣stian, that he positively avers, we cannot so much as affirm <HI>Jesus to be the Lord, without it</HI>; which insi∣nuates no less,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Spiritual Truths are Lyes spoken by Carnal Mlen.</NOTE> than that the Spiritual Truths of the Gospel are as Lyes in the Mouths of carnal and un∣spiritual Men; for tho' in themselves they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e true, yet are they not true, as to them, because not known, nor a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered forth in and by that Principle and Spirit that
<PB N="31" REF="003129_0022_0FF004290A8705C8"/>
ought to direct the Mind, and actuate it; in such things they are no better than the counterfeit Re∣presentations of things in a Comedy; neither can it be more truly and properly called a real and true Knowledge of God and Christ, than the actings of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, and <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> &amp;c. if now Transacted upon a Stage, might be called truly and really their doings, or the Persons representing them might be said truly and really to have conquered <HI>Asia,</HI> and overcome <HI>Pompey,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Knowledge then of Christ, which is not by the Revelation of his own Spirit in the Heart, is no more properly the Knowledge of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Like the pratling of a <HI>Parrot.</HI></NOTE> than the Pratling of a <HI>Parrot,</HI> which has been taught a few words, may be said to be the Voice of a Man; for as that, or some other Bird, may be taught to sound or utter forth a rational Sentence, as it hath learned it by the outward Ear, and not from any living Principle of Reason actuating it: So, just such is that Knowledge of the things of God, which the natural and carnal Man hath gathered from the Words or Writings of Spiritual Men, which are not true to him, because conceived in the natural Spirit, and so brought forth by the wrong Organ, and not proceeding from the Spiritual Principle; no more than the words of a Man, acquired by Art, and brought forth by the Mouth of a Bird, not pro∣ceeding from a Rational Principle, are true, with respect to the Bird which utters them. Where∣fore from this Scripture, I shall further add this Ar∣gument:</P>
<P>If no Man can say <HI>Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost,</HI> then no Man can know <HI>Jesus to be the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>But the First is true: Therefore the Second.</P>
<P>From this Argument there may be another de∣duced, concluding in the very terms of this Asser∣tion: thus,</P>
<PB N="32" REF="003129_0023_0FF0042AC4189580"/>
<P>If no Man can know <HI>Jesus to be the Lord but by the Holy Ghost,</HI> then there can be no certain Knowledge or Revelation of him but by the Spirit.</P>
<P>But the First is true, therefore the Second.</P>
<P N="7"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Assert.</HI> III.</NOTE>§. VII. The Third thing affirmed, is, <HI>That by the Spirit God always revealed himself to his Children.</HI></P>
<P>For making appear the Truth of this Assertion, it will be but needful to consider God's manifesting himself towards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proved.</NOTE> and in relation to his Creatures, from the beginning, which resolves it self always herein. The first Step of all is ascribed hereunto by <HI>Moses,</HI> Gen. 1.2. <HI>And the Spirit of God moved upon the Face of the Waters.</HI> I think it will not be denied, that God's Converse with Man, all along from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">That Reve∣lation is by the Spirit of God.</NOTE> was by the Immediate Mani∣festation of his Spirit: And afterwards, through the whole Tract of the Law, he spake to his Chil∣dren no otherways; which, as it naturally follow∣eth from the Principles above proved, so it cannot be denied, by such as acknowledge the Scriptures of Truth to have been written by the Inspira∣tion of the Holy Ghost: For these Writings, from <HI>Moses</HI> to <HI>Malachy,</HI> do declare, that during all that time, God revealed himself to his Children by his Spirit.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> But if any will object, <HI>That after the Dispensation of the Law, God's Method of speaking was altered.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer: <HI>First,</HI> That God spake always im∣mediately to the <HI>Jews,</HI> in that he spake always im∣mediately to the <HI>High-Priest</HI> from betwixt the <HI>Cherubims</HI>; who, when he entered into the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sanctum Sancterum</NOTE> returning, did relate to the whole People the Voice and Will of God, there immediately revealed. So that this immediate Speaking never ceas'd in any Age.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> From this immediate Fellowship were none shut out, who earnestly sought after, and waited for it; in that many, besides the <HI>High-Priest,</HI> who were not so much as of the Kindred of
<PB N="33" REF="003129_0023_0FF0042AC4189580"/>
<HI>Levi,</HI> nor of the Prophets, did receive it and speak from it; as it is written, <HI>Numb.</HI> 11.25. where the <HI>Spirit</HI> is said to have <HI>rested upon the Seventy Elders</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">None shut out from this Imme∣diate Fel∣lowship.</NOTE> which Spirit also reached unto two that were not in the Tabernacle, but in the Camp; whom when some would have forbidden, <HI>Moses</HI> would not, but re¦joyced, <HI>wishing that all the Lord's People were Prophets, and that he would put his Spirit upon them,</HI> vers. 29.</P>
<P>This is also confirmed <HI>Neb.</HI> 9. Where the Elders of the people, after their return from Captivity, when they began to sanctifie themselves by Fasting and Prayer; in which, numbering up the many Mer∣cies of God towards their Fathers, they say, verse 20. <HI>Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them</HI>; and verse 30. <HI>Yet many Years didst thou forbear, and testifie against them by thy Spirit in thy Prophets.</HI> Many are the Sayings of Spiritual <HI>David,</HI> to this purpose, as <HI>Psalm</HI> 51.11, 12. <HI>Take not thy holy Spirit from me; uphold me with thy free Spirit.</HI> Psalm 193.7. <HI>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?</HI> Hereunto doth the Pro∣phet <HI>Isaiah</HI> ascribe the credit of his Testimony, saying, chap. 48. v. 16. <HI>And now the Lord God and his Spirit hath sent me.</HI> And that God revealed him∣self to his Children under the New Testament, to wit, to the Apostles, Evangelists, and Primitive Disciples, is confessed by all. How far now this yet continueth, and is to be expected, comes here∣after to be spoken to.</P>
<P N="8">§. VIII. The fourth thing affirmed, is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Assert.</HI> IV.</NOTE> <HI>That these Revelations were the Object of the Saints Faith of old.</HI></P>
<P>This will easily appear by the definition of Faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Proved.</NOTE> and considering what its Object is: For which we shall not dive into the curious and various Notions of the School-Men, but stay in the plain and posi∣tive words of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> who, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. de∣scribes it two ways. <HI>Faith</HI> (saith he) <HI>is the substance of things hoped for, and the Evidence of things not seen</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Faith is?</NOTE> Which, as the Apostle illustrateth it in the same Chapter by many Examples, is no other but a firm
<PB N="34" REF="003129_0024_0FF0042E45581290"/>
and certain Belief of the Mind, whereby it <HI>resteth,</HI> and in a sense <HI>possesseth</HI> the Substance of some things hoped for, through its Confidence in the Promise of God: And thus the Soul hath a most firm Evi∣dence, by its Faith, of things not yet seen nor come to pass. The Object of this Faith, is the <HI>Promise, Word,</HI> or <HI>Testimony of God,</HI> speaking in the Mind. Hence it hath been generally affirmed, That the Object of Faith is <HI>Deus Loquens,</HI> &amp;c. that is, <HI>God Speaking,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Object of Faith, <HI>Deus Lo∣quens.</HI></NOTE> &amp;c. Which also is manifest from all those Examples, deduced by the Apostle throughout that whole Chapter, whose Faith was founded neither upon any outward Testimony, nor upon the Voice or Writing of Man, but upon the Revelation of God's Will, manifest unto them, and in them; as in the Example of <HI>Noah</HI> ver. 7. thus, <HI>By Faith</HI> Noah <HI>being warned of God, of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an Ark to the saving of his House; by the which he condemned the World, and became Heir of the Righteousness which is by Faith.</HI> What was here the Object of <HI>Noah</HI>'s <HI>Faith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Noah<HI>'s Faith.</HI></NOTE> but God speaking unto him? He had not the Writings nor Prophesyings of any going before, nor yet the Concurrence of any Church or People, to strengthen him; and yet his Faith in the Word, by which he contradicted the whole World, saved him and his House. Of which also <HI>Abraham</HI> is set forth as a singular Example, be∣ing therefore called the Father of the Faithful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Abraham<HI>'s Faith.</HI></NOTE> who is said <HI>against hope to have believed in hope</HI>; in that he not only willingly forsook his Father's Country not knowing whither he went, in that he believed con∣cerning the coming of <HI>Isaac,</HI> though contrary to natural probability; but above all, in that he re∣fused not to offer him up, not doubting but God was able to raise him from the Dead; of whom it is said, That <HI>in Isaac shall thy Seed be called.</HI> And last of all, In that he rested in the Promise, that his Seed should Possess the Land, wherein himself was but a Pilgrim, and which to them was not to be
<PB N="35" REF="003129_0024_0FF0042E45581290"/>
fulfilled while divers Ages after. The Object of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Faith, in all this, was no other but in∣ward and immediate Revelation, or God signifying his Will unto him inwardly and immediately by his Spirit.</P>
<P>But because, in this part of the Proposition, we made also mention of external Voices, Appearances and Dreams in the Alternative, I think also fit to speak hereof, what in that respect, may be object∣ed; to wit,</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>That those, who found their Faith now upon Immediate and Objective Revelation, ought to have also outward Voices or Visions, Dreams or Apearances for it.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> It is not denied, but God made use of the Mini∣stry of Angels, who in the appearance of Men, spake outwardly to the Saints of old,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mini∣stry of An∣gels, speak∣ing in the appearance of Men to the <HI>Saints</HI> of old.</NOTE> and that he did also reveal some things to them in Dreams and Visions; none of which we will affirm to be ceased. so as to limit the Power and Liberty of God, in manifesting himself towards his Childern. But while we are considering the Object of Faith, we must not stick to that which is but Circumstantially and Accidentally so, but to that which is Univer∣sally and Substantially so.</P>
<P>Next again, We must distinguish betwixt that which in it self is subject to doubt and delusion, and therefore is received for and because of ano∣ther; and that which is not subject to any doubt, but is received simply for, and because of it felt, as being <HI>Prima Veritas,</HI> the <HI>very First</HI> and <HI>Original</HI> Truth. Let us then consider how, or how far these outward Voices, Appearances and Dreams,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Revela∣tions by Dreams and Visions</NOTE> were the Object of the Saints Faith: Was it because they were simply Voices, Appearances or Dreams? Nay, certainly, we know, and they were not ignorant, that the Devil can form a sound of words, and convey it to the outward Ear; that he can easily deceive the outward senses, by making things to appear, that are not. Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, do we not see by daily
<PB N="36" REF="003129_0025_0FF004309CED3A48"/>
Experience, that the <HI>Jugglers</HI> and <HI>Mountebanks</HI> can do as much as all that, by their <HI>Legerdemain</HI>; God forbid then, that the Saints Faith should be founded upon so fallacious a Foundation, as Man's outward and fallible Senses. What made them then give credit to these Visions? Certainly nothing else but the secret Testimony of <HI>God's Spirit</HI> in their Hearts, assuring them that the Voices, Dreams and Visions were of and from God. <HI>Abraham</HI> believed the Angels; but who told him that these Men were Angels? We must not think his Faith then was built upon his outward Senses; but proceeded from the secret Perswasion of God's Spirit in his Heart. This then must needs be acknowledged to be ori∣ginally and principally the object of the Saints Faith; without which there is no true and certain Faith, and by which many times Faith is begotten and strengthened, without any of these outward or visible Helps; as we may observe in many Passages of the Holy Scripture, where it is only mentioned, <HI>And God said,</HI> &amp;c. And <HI>the Word of the Lord came</HI> unto such and such, <HI>saying,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> But if any one should pertinaciously affirm, <HI>That this did import an outward audible Voice to the Carnal Ear.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I would gladly know, what other Argument such a one could bring for this his Affirmation, saving his own simple Conjecture. It is said indeed, <HI>The Spirit witnesseth with our spirit</HI>; but not to our out∣ward Ears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spirit speaks to the spiritu∣al Ear, not to the out∣ward.</NOTE> <HI>Rom</HI> 8.16. And seeing the Spirit of God is within us, and not without us only, it speaks to our spiritual, and not to our bodily Ear. There∣fore I see no reason, where it's so often said in Scrip∣ture, <HI>The Spirit said, moved, hindered, called</HI> such or such a one, to <HI>do</HI> or <HI>forbear</HI> such or such a thing, that any have to conclude, that this was not an Inward Voice to the Ear of the Soul, rather than an Outward Voice to the Bodily Ear. If any be otherwise minded, let them, if they can, produce
<PB N="37" REF="003129_0025_0FF004309CED3A48"/>
their Arguments, and we may further consider of them.</P>
<P>From all then which is above declared, I shall deduce, an Argument to conclude the Probation of this Assertion, thus:</P>
<P>That which any one firmly believes, as the ground and foundation of his Hope in God, and Life Eternal, is the formal Object of his Faith.</P>
<P>But the inward and immediate Revelation of God's Spirit, speaking in and unto the Saints, was by them believed, as the ground and foundation of their Hope in God, and Life Eternal.</P>
<P>Therefore these inward an immediate Revela∣tions were the formal Object of their Faith.</P>
<P N="9">§. IX. That which now cometh under Debate, is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Assert. <HI>V.</HI> Proved.</NOTE> what we asserted in the last place, to wit, <HI>That the same continueth to be the Object of the Saints Faith unto this day.</HI> Many will agree to what we have said before who differ from us herein.</P>
<P>There is nevertheless a very firm Argument con∣firming the Truth of this Assertion, included in the Proposition it self, to wit, <HI>That the Object of the Saints Faith is the same in all Ages tho' held forth under divers Administrations.</HI> Which I shall reduce to an Argu∣ment, and prove thus:</P>
<P>First, <HI>Where the Faith is one, the Object of the Faith is one.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But the Faith is one: Therefore,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>That the Faith is one, is the express words of the Apostle, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.5. who placeth the <HI>one Faith</HI> with the <HI>one God</HI>; importing no less than, that to affirm <HI>two Faiths,</HI> is as absurd as to affirm <HI>two Gods.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, if the <HI>Faith</HI> of the Ancients were not one and the same with ours <HI>i. e.</HI> agreeing in <HI>Substance</HI> therewith, and receiving the same definition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Faith of the Saints of old, the same with ours.</NOTE> it had been impertinent for the Apostle, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11. to have illustrated the definition of our Faith, by the Ex∣amples of that of the Ancients, or to go about to move us by the Example of <HI>Abraham,</HI> if <HI>Abraham</HI>'s
<PB N="38" REF="003129_0026_0FF0043262EDE118"/>
Faith were different in nature from ours. Nor doth hence any Difference arise, because they believed in Christ, with respect to his Appearance outwardly as future; and we, as already appeared: For, neither did they then so believe in him to come, as not to feel him present with them, and witness him near: seeing the Apostl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saith, <HI>They all drank of that spiri∣tual Rock which followed them, which Rock was Christ.</HI> Nor do we so believe concerning his Appearance past, as not also to feel and know him <HI>present with us,</HI> and to <HI>feed upon him; except Christ</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>be in you, ye are Reprobates:</HI> So that both our Faith is one, terminating in one and the same thing. And as to the other Part or Consequence of the Antecedent, to wit, <HI>That the Object is one, where the Faith is one</HI>; the Apostle also proveth it in the forecited Chapter, where he makes all the Wor∣thies of old, Examples to us. Now wherein are they imitable, but because they believed in God? And what was the Object of their Faith, but in∣ward and immediate Revelation, as we have before proved? Their Example can be no Ways applicable to us, except we believe in God, as they did; that is, by the same Object. The Apostle clears this yet further by his own Example, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.16. where he saith, <HI>So soon as Christ was revealed in him, he con∣sulted not with Flesh and Blood, but forthwith believed and obeyed.</HI> The same Apostle, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.7.8. where he exhorteth the <HI>Hebrews</HI> to follow the Faith of the Elders, adds this Reason, <HI>Considering the End of their Conversation, Jesus Christ, the same to day, yesterday, and for ever:</HI> Hereby notably insinuating, that in the Object there is no alteration.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If any object the <HI>Diversity of Administration:</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; That altereth not at all the Object: For the same Apostle mentioning this Diversity three times, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.4, 5, 6. centereth always in the same Object; the same Spirit, the same Lord, the same God.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="003129_0026_0FF0043262EDE118"/>
<P>But further, If the Object of Faith were not one and the same, both to us and to them, then it would follow, that we were to know God some other way, than by the Spirit.</P>
<P>But this were absurd: Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, This is most firmly proved from a com∣mon and received Maxim of the School-men, to wit, <HI>Omnis actus specificatur a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> objecto,</HI> Every Act is specified from its Object: From which (if it be true, as they acknowledge; tho' for the sake of many, I shall not recur to this Argument, as being too nice and Scholastick; neither lay I much stress upon those kind of Things, as being that which commends not the Simplicity of the Gospel) <HI>If the</HI> Object <HI>were different, the</HI> Faith <HI>would be different also.</HI></P>
<P>Such as deny this Proposition now a days, use here a Distinction; granting, that God <HI>is to be known by his</HI> Spirit; but again denying, that <HI>it is Immediate or Inward, but in and by the</HI> Scriptures, <HI>in which the Mind of the</HI> Spirit (as they say) <HI>being fully and amply expressed, we are thereby to</HI> know God, <HI>and be led in all things.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Negative of this Assertion, That the Scriptures are not sufficient, neither were ever ap∣pointed to be the adequate and only Rule, nor yet can guide or direct a Christian, in all those things that are needful for him to know, we shall leave that to the next Proposition to be examined. What is proper in this place to be proved, is, <HI>That Chri∣stians now are to be led inwardly and immediately by the</HI> Spirit of God, <HI>even in the same Manner (tho' it be∣fall not to many to be led in the same Measure) as the</HI> Saints <HI>were of old.</HI></P>
<P N="10">§. X. I shall prove this by divers Arguments;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christians are now to be led by the Spirit, in the same <HI>manner</HI> as the Saints of old.</NOTE> and first from the Promise of Christ in these Words, John 14.16. <HI>And I will pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.</HI> Vers. 17. <HI>Even the</HI> Spirit of Truth, <HI>whom
<PB N="40" REF="003129_0027_0FF0043484EF2B18"/>
the World cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nei∣ther knoweth him; but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</HI> Again, Vers. 26. <HI>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my Name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your Remembrance</HI>; and 16.13. <HI>But when the Spirit of Truth shall come, he shall lead you into all Truth: For he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, he shall speak, and shall de∣clare unto you things to come.</HI> We have here first, who this is, and that is divers ways expressed, to wit, <HI>The Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, the Holy Ghost, the Sent of the Father in the Name of Christ.</HI> And hereby is sufficiently proved the sottishness of those <HI>Socinians,</HI> and other carnal Christians, who neither know nor acknowledge any Internal Spirit or Power, but that which is meerly Natural, by which they sufficiently declare themselves to be of the World, who cannot receive the Spirit, be∣cause they neither see him, nor know him. <HI>Second∣ly,</HI> Where this Spirit is to be, <HI>He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</HI> And, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> What his Work is, <HI>He shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your Remembrance, and guide you into all Truth,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Query</HI> I.</NOTE>As to the <HI>First,</HI> Most do acknowledge that there is nothing else understood, than what the plain words signifie:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who is this Comforter?</NOTE> Which is also evident by many other places of Scripture, that will hereafter occur; neither do I see, how such as affirm otherways, can avoid Blasphemy: For if the <HI>Comforter,</HI> the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and <HI>Spirit of Truth,</HI> be all one with the Scriptures, then it will follow that the Scriptures are God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nonsensical Consequen∣ces from the <HI>Socinians</HI> belief of the Scrip∣tures being the Spirit.</NOTE> seeing it is true that the Holy Ghost is God. If these Mens Reasoning might take place, wherever the <HI>Spirit</HI> is mentioned, in relation to the Saints, thereby might be truly and properly understood the <HI>Scriptures:</HI> Which, what a non∣sensical Monster it would make of the Christian Re∣ligion,
<PB N="41" REF="003129_0027_0FF0043484EF2B18"/>
will easily appear to all Men. As where it is said, <HI>A Manifestation of the Spirit is given to every Man to profit withal</HI>; it might be render'd thus, A Manifestation of the <HI>Scripures</HI> is given to every Man to profit withal; what notable Sense this would make, and what a curious Interpretation, let us consider by the sequel of the same Chapter, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.9, 10, 11. <HI>To another the Gifts of Healing, by the same Spirit; to another, the working of Mira∣cles,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But all these worketh that one and the self same Spirit, dividing to every Man severally as he will.</HI> What would now these great Masters of Reason, the <HI>Socinians,</HI> judge, if we should place the Scriptures, here instead of the Spirit? Would it answer their Reason, which is the great Guide of their Faith? Would it be good and sound Reason in their <HI>Lo∣gical Schools,</HI> to affirm that the Scripture divideth severally, as it will, and giveth to some the <HI>Gift of Healing, to others the working of Miracles?</HI> If then this Spirit, a Manifestation whereof is given to every Man to profit withal, be no other than that <HI>Spirit of Truth,</HI> before-mentioned, <HI>which guideth into all Truth,</HI> this Spirit of Truth cannot be the Scrip∣ture. I could infer an Hundred more Absurdities of this kind, upon this sottish Opinion; but what is said may suffice. For even some of themselves, being at times forgetful, or ashamed of their own Doctine, do acknowledge, that the Spirit of God is another thing, and distinct from the Scriptures, to Guide and Influence the Saints.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That this Spirit is inward, in my opi∣nion, needs no Interpretation, or Commentary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Query <HI>II.</HI> Where is his place?</NOTE> <HI>He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</HI> This In∣dwelling of the Spirit in the Saints, as it is a thing most needful to be known and believed; so is it as positively asserted in the Scripture, as any thing else can be. <HI>If so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you,</HI> saith the Apostle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> chap. 8.9. And again, <HI>Know ye not that your Body is the Temple of the Holy

Ghost,</HI> 1 Cor. 6.19. <HI>And that the</HI> Spirit of God <HI>dwelleth in you?</HI> 1 Cor. 3.16. Without this the Apostle rec∣koneth no Man a Christian. <HI>If any Man</HI> (saith he) <HI>have not the</HI> Spirit of Christ, <HI>he is none of his.</HI> These Words immediately follow those above mentioned, out of the Epistle to the <HI>Romans, But ye are not in the Flesh, if so be the</HI> Spirit of God <HI>dwell in you.</HI> The Context of which sheweth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spirit</HI> within, the main Token of a Chri∣stian.</NOTE> that the Apostle reckoneth it the main Token of a Christian, both positively and negatively: For in the former Verses, he sheweth how the <HI>carnal Mind is Enmity against God,</HI> and that such as are in the <HI>Flesh cannot please him.</HI> Where subsuming, he adds concerning the <HI>Romans,</HI> that they <HI>are not in the Flesh, if the</HI> Spirit of God <HI>dwell in them.</HI> What is this but to affirm, that they in whom the Spirit dwells, are no longer in the Flesh, nor of those who please not God, but are become Christians indeed? Again, in the next Verse he concludes negatively, that, <HI>If any Man have not the</HI> Spirit of Christ, <HI>he is none of his</HI>; that is, he is no Christian. He then that acknowledges himself ignorant, and a Stranger to the Inward In being of the Spirit of Christ in his Heart, doth thereby acknowledge himself to be yet in the Car∣nal Mind, which is Enmity to God; to be yet in the Flesh, where God cannot be pleased; and in short, (whatever he may otherways know or be∣lieve of Christ, or however much skilled or ac∣quainted with the Letter of the Holy Scripture) not yet to be (notwithstanding all that) attained to the least Degree of a Christian; yea, not once to have embraced the Christian Religion. For take but away the Spirit, and Christianity remains no more Christianity, than the dead Carcass of a Man, when the Soul and Spirit is departed, remains a Man; which the Living can no more abide, but do bury out of their Sight as a noisom and useless thing, however acceptable it hath been, when actuated and moved by the Soul. Lastly, <HI>What∣soever
<PB N="43" REF="003129_0028_0FF00436F6620710"/>
is Excellent, whatsoever is Noble, whatsoever is Worthy, whatsoever is Desirable</HI> in the Christian Faith, is ascribed to this Spirit; without which it could no more subsist, than the outward World without the Sun. Hereunto have all true Christians, in all Ages, attributed their Strength and Life. It is by this Spirt, that they avouch themselves to have been converted to God, to have been redeemed from the World, to have been strengthened in their Weakness, comforted in their Afflictions, confirm∣ed in their Temptations, imboldened in their Suf∣ferings, and triumphed in the midst of all their Persecutions, Yea, The Writings of all true Christians are full of the great and notable Things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great and nota∣ble Acts that have been and are per∣formed by the <HI>Spirit</HI> in all Ages.</NOTE> which they all affirm themselves to have done, by the Power, and Vertue, and Efficacy of this Spirit of God working in them. <HI>It is the</HI> Spirit <HI>that quick∣neth,</HI> John 6.63. It was the Spirit <HI>that gave them Utterance,</HI> Acts 2.4. It was the Spirit by which <HI>Ste∣phen</HI> spake, <HI>That the Jews were not able to resist,</HI> Acts 6.10. It is such as <HI>walk after the</HI> Spirit, <HI>that receive no Condemnation,</HI> Rom. 8.1. It is the <HI>Law of the</HI> Spi∣rit <HI>that makes free,</HI> vers. 2.

It is this Spirit <HI>that bear∣eth witness with our spirit that we are the Children of God,</HI> vers. 16. It is this Spirit <HI>that helpeth our In∣firmities, and maketh Intercession for us, with Groan∣ings which cannot be uttered,</HI> vers. 26. It is by this Spirit that the glorious Things which God hath laid up for us, <HI>which neither outward Ear hath heard, nor outward Eye hath seen, nor the Heart of Man con∣ceived,</HI> by all his reasonings, are revealed unto us, 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 2.9, 10. It is by this Spirit, that both <HI>Wisdom</HI>

and <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Miracles,</HI> and <HI>Tongues,</HI> and <HI>Prophecies,</HI> are obtained, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.8, 9, 10. It is by this <HI>Spirit,</HI> that we are <HI>all Baptized into one Body,</HI> vers. 13. In short, what thing relating to the Salvation of the Soul and to the Life of a Christian, is rightly performed, or effectually ob∣tained, without it? And what shall I more say? For the time would fail me, to tell of all those things, which the Holy Men of Old have declared; and the Saints of this day, do witness themselves to enjoy, by the Vertue and Power of this <HI>Spirit dwelling in them.</HI> Truly my Paper could not con∣tain those many Testimonies, whereby this Truth is confirmed; wherefore, besides what is above∣mentioned out of the Fathers, whom all pretend to Reverence, and those of <HI>Luther</HI> and <HI>Melancthon,</HI> I shall deduce yet one observable Testimony out of <HI>Calvin,</HI> because not a few of the Followers of his Doctrine do refuse and deride (and that as it is to be feared, because of their own Non-experience thereof) this way of the Spirit's In-dwelling, as uncertain and dangerous; that so, if neither the Testimony of the Scripture, nor the Sayings of others, nor right Reason can move them, they may at least be reproved by the Words of their own Ma∣ster, who saith in the third Book of his Institutions, <HI>Cap.</HI> 2. on this wise:</P>

But while we simply say, with <HI>Paul,</HI> that <HI>we have received not the Spirit of this World, but the Spirit which is of God</HI>; by whose Teaching we know those things that are given us of God: What can they prate against it, without reproaching the Spirit of God?

But they cry out, <HI>That it is not without great Temerity, that we dare so boast of the Spirit of Christ.</HI> Who would believe that the Sottishness of these Men was so great, who would be esteemed the Masters of the World, that they should so fail in the first Principles of Religion? Verily I could not believe it, if their own Writings did not testify so much. <HI>Paul</HI> ac∣counts those the Sons of God, who are acted by the Spirit of God; but these will have the Children of God acted by their own Spirits, without the Spi∣rit of God. He will have us call God <HI>Father,</HI> the Spirit dictating that Term unto us, which only can witness to our Spirits, that we are the Sons of God. These, though they cease not to call upon God, do nevertheless demit the Spirit, by whose guiding he is rightly to be called upon. He denies them to be the Sons of God, or the Ser∣vants of Christ, who are not led by his Spirit; but these feign a Christianity that needs not the Spirit of Christ. He makes no Hope of the bles∣sed Resurrection, unless we feel the Spirit residing in us; but these feign a Hope without any such a feeling. But perhaps they will answer, that they deny not but that it is necessary to have it, only of Modesty and Humility we ought to deny and not acknowledge it. What means he then, when he commands the <HI>Corinthians</HI> to <HI>try themselves,</HI> if they be in the Faith; to <HI>examine themselves,</HI> whe∣ther they have Christ, whom whosoever acknow∣ledges not dwelling in him, is a Reprobate? <HI>By the Spirit which he hath given us,</HI> saith <HI>John, we know that he abideth in us.</HI> And what do we then else but call in question Christ his Promise, while we would be esteemed the Servants of God, without his Spirit, which he declared he would <HI>pour out upon all his?</HI> Seeing these things are the first grounds

of Piety,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Without the <HI>Spirit's</HI> Presence, <HI>Christan∣ity</HI> must cease.</NOTE> it is miserable Blindness to accuse Chri∣stians of Pride, because they dare glory of the Presence of the Spirit; without which glorying, Christianity it self could not be.

<P>If therefore it be so, Why should any be so foolish, as to deny, or so unwise, as not to seek after this Spirit, which Christ hath promised shall dwell in his Children?

<PB N="47" REF="003129_0030_0FF0043A4EF237B8"/>
<P>From all then that hath been mentioned, con∣cerning this Promise, and these Words of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A perpetual Ordinance to <HI>God's</HI> Church and People.</NOTE> it will follow, That Christans are always to be led inwardly and immediately by the Spirit of God dwelling in them; and that the same is a standing and perpetual Ordinance, as well to the Church in general in all Ages, as to every individual Member in particular; as appears from this Argument:</P>
<P>The <HI>Promises</HI> of Christ to his Children are <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Amen,</HI> and cannot fail, but must of necessity be fulfilled</P>
<P>But Christ hath promised, That the <HI>Comfor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> the <HI>Spirit of Truth,</HI> shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lde with his Children for ever, shall dwell with them, shall be in them; shall lead them into all Truth, shall teach them all things, and bring all things to their Re∣membrance.</P>
<P>Therefore, The <HI>Comforter,</HI> the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> the <HI>Spirit of Truth,</HI> his abiding with his Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Amen,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Again: No Man is redeemed from the Carnal Mind, which is at Enmity with God, which is not subject to the Law of God, neither can be: No Man is yet in the Spirit, but in the Flesh, and can∣not please God, except he in whom the Spirit of God dwells.</P>
<P>But every true Christian is (in measure) redeemed from the Carnal Mind, is gathered out of the En∣mity, and can be subject to the Law of God; is out of the Flesh, and in the Spirit, the Spirit of God dwelling in him.</P>
<P>Therefore every true Christian hath the Spirit of God dwelling in him.</P>
<P>Again: <HI>Whosoever hath not the</HI> Spirit of Christ, <HI>is none of his</HI>; that is, no <HI>Child,</HI> no <HI>Friend,</HI> no <HI>Disciple</HI> of Christ.</P>
<P>But every true Christian is a <HI>Child,</HI> a Friend, a <HI>Disciple</HI> of Christ.</P>
<P>Therefore every true Christian hath the Spirit of Christ.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="003129_0031_0FF0043CB886F280"/>
<P>Moreover: Whosoever is the Temple of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> in him the Spirit of God dwelleth and abideth.</P>
<P>But every true Christian is the Temple of the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore in every true Christian the Spirit of God dwelleth and abideth.</P>
<P>But to conclude: He in whom the Spirit of God dwelleth, it is not in him a lazy, dumb, useless thing; but it moveth, actuateth, governeth, in∣structeth, and teachech him all things, whatsoever are needful for him to know; yea, bringeth all things to his remembrance.</P>
<P>But the Spirit of God dwelleth in every true Christian:</P>
<P>Therefore the Spirit of God leadeth, instructeth, and teacheth every true Christian, whatsoever is needful for him to know.</P>
<P N="11"><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> §. XI. But there are some that will confess, <HI>That the</HI> Spirit <HI>doth now lead and influence the</HI> Saints, <HI>but that he doth it only subjectively, or in a blind manner, by inlightening their Understandings, to understand and believe the Truth delivered in the</HI> Scriptures; <HI>but not at all by presenting those Truths to the Mind, by way of Object,</HI> and this they call, <HI>Medium incognitum Assentiendi,</HI> as that, <HI>of whose working a Man is not sensible.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> This Opinion, though somewhat more tolerable than the former, is nevertheless not altogether ac∣cording to Truth, neither doth it reach the fulness of it.</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arg.</HI> I.</NOTE>1. Because there be many Truths, which as they are applicable to particulars, and individuals, and most needfull to be known by them, are in no wise to be found in the Scripture, as in the following <HI>Pro∣position</HI> shall be shewn</P>
<P>Besides, the <HI>Arguments</HI> already adduced to prove, that the Spirit doth not only <HI>subjectively</HI> help us to discern Truths, elsewhere delivered, but also <HI>ob∣jectively</HI>
<PB N="49" REF="003129_0031_0FF0043CB886F280"/>
present those Truths to our Minds. For that which teacheth me all things, and is given me for that end; without doubt presents those things to my mind, which it teacheth me. It is not said, <HI>It shall teach you how to understand those things that are written</HI>; but, <HI>It shall teach you all things.</HI> Again, That which brings all things to my Remembrance, must needs present them by way of Object; else it were improper to say, It brought them to my Re∣membrance; but only, that it helpeth to remember the Objects brought from elsewhere.</P>
<P>My second Argument shall be drawn from the Nature of the <HI>New Covenant</HI>; by which,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Arg.</HI> II.</NOTE> and those that follow, I shall prove that we are led by the Spirit, both <HI>Immediately</HI> and <HI>Objectively.</HI> The Na∣ture of the New Covenant is expressed in divers places: And</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="I"/> First, <HI>Isa.</HI> 59.21. <HI>As for me, this is my Covenant with them, saith the Lord, My</HI> Spirit <HI>that is upon thee, and my Words which I have put into thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed, nor out of the mouth of thy Seed's Seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lead∣ings of the Spirit.</NOTE> By the latter part of this, is sufficiently expressed the Perpetuity and Continuance of this Promise, <HI>It shall not depart, saith the Lord, from henceforth and for ever.</HI> In the former part is the Promise it self, which is the Spirit of God being upon them, and the Words of God being put into their Mouths.</P>
<P>First, This was <HI>Immediate,</HI> for there is no men∣tion made of any <HI>Medium</HI>; he saith not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1. Immedi∣ately.</NOTE> I shall by the Means of such and such Writings or Books, convey such and such Words into your Mouths; but <HI>My Words, I, even I, saith the Lord, shall put into your Mouths.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, This must be <HI>Objectively</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. Ob∣jectively.</NOTE> for (<HI>the Words put into the Mouth</HI>) are the Object presented by him. He saith not, The Words which ye shall see written, my Spirit shall only enlighten your Understandings
<PB N="50" REF="003129_0032_0FF0043E9D6A8480"/>
to assent unto; but positively, <HI>My Words which I have put into thy Mouth,</HI> &amp;c. From whence I Ar∣gue thus:</P>
<P>Upon whomsoever the Spirit remaineth always, and putteth words into his Mouth, him doth the Spirit teach <HI>Immediately, Objectively,</HI> and <HI>Continually.</HI></P>
<P>But the Spirit is always upon the Seed of the Righteous, and putteth Words into their Mouths, neither departeth from them:</P>
<P>Therefore the Spirit teacheth the Righteous <HI>Im∣mediately, Objectively,</HI> and <HI>Continually.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="2"/> Secondly, The Nature of the <HI>New Covenant</HI> is yet more amply expessed, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.33. which is again repeated and re-asserted by the Apostle, <HI>Heb.</HI> 8. 10, 11. in these words, <HI>For this is the Covenant that I will make with the House of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their Minds, and write them in their Hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a People. And they shall not teach every Man his Neighbour, and every Man his Brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they shall all know me from the least to the greatest.</HI></P>
<P>The Object here is <HI>God's Law</HI> placed in the Heart, and written in the Mind; from whence they become God's People, and are brought truly to know him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Diffe∣rence be∣tween the Outward and Inward Law.</NOTE>In this then is the <HI>Law</HI> distinguished from the <HI>Gospel</HI>: The <HI>Law</HI> before was outward, written in Tables of Stone; but now is inward, written in the Heart: Of old the People depended upon their Priests for the Knowledge of God, but now they have all a certain and sensible Knowledge of Him; concerning which, <HI>Augustin</HI> speaketh well, in his Book <HI>De Litera &amp; Spiritu</HI>; from whom <HI>Aquinas</HI> first of all seems to have taken occasion to move this Question, <HI>Whether the New Law be a written Law, or, an Implanted Law? Lex scripta, vel Lex indita?</HI> Which he thus resolves, Affirming, <HI>That the New Law, or Gospel, is not properly a Law written, as the Old was but</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="003129_0032_0FF0043E9D6A8480"/>
Lex Indita, <HI>an Implanted Law</HI>; and that <HI>the old Law was written without, but the new Law is written within, on the Table of the Heart.</HI></P>
<P>How much then are they deceived, who instead of making the Gospel preferable to the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gospel Dispensa∣tion more glorious than that of the Law.</NOTE> have made the Condition of such as are under the Gos∣pel far worse? For no doubt it is a far better, and more desirable thing, to converse with God <HI>Imme∣diately,</HI> than only <HI>Mediately,</HI> as being a higher and more glorious Dispensation: And yet these Men acknowledge, that many under the Law, had <HI>Im∣mediate</HI> Converse with God, whereas they now cry it is ceased.</P>
<P>Again, Under the Law there was the Holy of Holies, into which the High Priest did enter, and received the Word of the Lord <HI>immediately</HI> from be∣twixt the Cherubims, so that the People could then certainly know the Mind of the Lord; but now, according to these Men's Judgment, we are in a far worse Condition, having nothing but the outward Letter of the Scripture, to guess and divine from; concerning one Verse of which, scarce two can be found to agree. But Jesus Christ hath promised us better things (tho' many are so unwise, as not to believe him) even to guide us, by his own unerring Spirit, and hath rent and removed the Vail, where∣by not only one, and that once a Year, may enter; but all of us at all times have access unto him; as often as we draw near unto him with pure Hearts, he reveals his Will to us by his Spirit, and writes his Laws in our Hearts. These things then being thus premised; I argue,</P>
<P><LIST TYPE="syllogism">
<ITEM>Where the Law of God is put into the Mind, and written in the Heart, there the Object of Faith, and Revelation of the Knowledge of God is <HI>inward, im∣mediate</HI> and <HI>objective.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>But the Law of God is put into the Mind, and written in the Heart of every True Christian, un∣der the new Covenant.</ITEM>
<PB N="52" REF="003129_0033_0FF0044096C05358"/>
<ITEM>Therefore the Object of Faith, and Revelation of the knowledge of God to every True Christian, is inward, immediate and objective.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The <HI>assumption</HI> is the express Words of Scripture: The <HI>Proposition</HI> then must needs be true, except that <HI>which is put into the Mind, and written in the Heart,</HI> were either not <HI>inward,</HI> not <HI>immediate,</HI> or not <HI>ob∣jective,</HI> which is most absurd.</P>
<P N="12"><MILESTONE UNIT="Arg." N="III"/> §. XII. The third Argument is from these Words of <HI>John,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 2. ver. 27. <HI>But the Anointing, which ye have received of him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Anoin∣ing recom∣mended as.</NOTE> abideth in you, and ye need not that any Man teach you: but as the same Anoint∣ing teacheth you of all things, and is Truth, and no Lye, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1"/> <HI>First,</HI> This could not be any special, peculiar, or extraordinary priviledge, but that which is com∣mon to all the Saints,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Common.</NOTE> it being a general Epistle, directed to all them of that Age.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"/> <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Apostle proposeth this Anointing in them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certain.</NOTE> as a more certain Touch-stone for them to discern and try Seducers by, even than his own Writings; for having in the former verse said, that he had Written some things to them, concern∣ing such as Seduced them, he begins the next verse, <HI>But the Anointing,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and ye need not that any Man teach you,</HI> &amp;c. which infers, that ha∣ving said to them what can be said, he re∣fers them for all to the inward Anointing, (which teacheth all things) as the most firm, constant, and certain Bull-wark, against all Seducers.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"/> And <HI>Lastly,</HI> That it is a lasting and continuing thing; the Anointing which abideth; if it had not been to abide in them, it could not have taught them all things, neither guided them against all hazard. From which I argue thus:</P>
<P><LIST TYPE="syllogism">
<ITEM>He that hath an Anointing abiding in him, which teacheth him all things, so that he needs no Man to teach him, hath an inward, and immediate Teach∣er,

and hath some things inwardly and immediate∣ly Revealed unto him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>But the Saints have such an Anointing:</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I could prove this Doctrine from many more places of Scripture, which for brevity's sake I omit; and now come to the second part of the Proposition, where the Objections usually formed against it are answered.</P>
<P N="13"><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> §. XIII. The most usual is, That <HI>these Revelations are uncertain.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> But this bespeaketh much Ignorance in the Op∣posers; for we distinguish betwixt the <HI>Thesis</HI> and the <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> that is, betwixt the <HI>Proposition</HI> and <HI>Supposition.</HI> For it is one thing to affirm, <HI>that the true and undoubted Revelation of God's Spirit, is certain and infallible</HI>; and another thing to affirm, that this or that particular Person, or People, is led infallibly by this Revelation, in what they Speak or Write, because they affirm themselves to be so led, by the inward and immediate Revelation of the Spirit. The first is only by us asserted, the latter may be cal∣led in question. The question is not, who are, or are not so led? But whether all ought not, or may not be so led?</P>
<P>Seeing then, we have already proved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cer∣tainty of the Spirit's Guidance proved.</NOTE> that Christ hath promised his Spirit to lead his Children, and that every one of them both ought, and may be led by it; If any depart from this certain Guide, in Deeds, and yet in Words pretend to be led by it into things, that are not good, it will not from thence follow, that the true guidance of the Spirit is uncertain, or ought not to be followed, no more than it will follow, that the Sun sheweth not light, be∣cause a Blind Man, or one who wilfully shuts his Eyes, falls into a Ditch at Noon day for want of Light; or that no Words are spoken, because a Deaf Man hears them not: or that a Garden full of fragrant Flowers has no sweet smell, because he
<PB N="54" REF="003129_0034_0FF00443CFB81BE0"/>
that has lost his Smelling, doth not Smell it; the fault then is in the Organ, and not in the Object.</P>
<P>All these Mistakes therefore are to be ascribed to the Weakness or Wickedness of Men, and not to that Holy Spirit. Such as bend themselves most against this certain and infallible Testimony of the Spirit, use commonly to alledge the Example of the old <HI>Gnosticks,</HI> and the late Monstrous and Mischie∣vous Actings of the <HI>Anabaptists</HI> of <HI>Munster</HI>; all which toucheth us nothing at all, neither weakens a whit our most true Doctrine. Wherefore, as a most sure Bulwark against such kind of Assaults, was sub∣joyned that other part of our Proposition, thus; <HI>Moreover, these Divine and Inward Revelations, which we establish, as absolutely necessary for the founding of the True Faith, as they do not, so neither can they at anytime contradict the</HI> Scriptures Testimony, <HI>or sound Reason.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">—By Expe∣rience.</NOTE>Besides the intrinsick and undoubted Truth of this Assertion, we can boldly affirm it, from our certain and blessed Experience. For this Spirit never deceived us, never acted nor moved us to any thing that was amiss; but is clear and manifest in its Revelations, which are evidently discerned of us, as we wait in that <HI>pure and undefiled Light of God</HI> (that proper and fit <HI>Organ</HI>) in which they are received. Therefore if any reason after this manner,</P>
<P><HI>(That because some Wicked Ungodly, Devilish Men, have committed wicked Actions, and have yet more wickedly asserted, that they were led into these things by the</HI> Spirit of God,</P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>No Man ought to lean to the</HI> Spirit of God <HI>or seek to be led by it.</HI>)</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Absur∣dity of the Conse∣quence.</NOTE>I utterly deny the Conseqence of this Proposi∣tion; which, were it to be received as true, then would all <HI>Faith in God,</HI> and <HI>Hope of Salvation,</HI> become uncertain, and the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> turned into meer <HI>Scepticism.</HI> For after the same manner I might reason thus:</P>
<PB N="55" REF="003129_0034_0FF00443CFB81BE0"/>
<P>Because <HI>Eve</HI> was deceived by the <HI>Lying of the Serpent</HI>:</P>
<P>Therefore she ought not to have trusted to the <HI>Promise of God.</HI></P>
<P>Because the old World was deluded by <HI>Evil Spirits</HI>:</P>
<P>Therefore ought neither <HI>Noah,</HI> nor <HI>Abraham,</HI> nor <HI>Moses,</HI> to have trusted the <HI>Spirit of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Because a lying spirit spake through the Four Hundred Prophets, that perswaded <HI>Ahab</HI> to go up and fight at <HI>Ramoth Gilead</HI>:</P>
<P>Therefore the Testimony of the <HI>true Spirit of Mi∣caiah</HI> was uncertain, and dangerous to be followed.</P>
<P>Because there were <HI>seducing spirits</HI> crept into the Church of old:</P>
<P>Therefore it was not good, or uncertain, to fol∣low the <HI>Anointing</HI> which taught all things, and is Truth, and no Lye.</P>
<P>Who dare say, that this is a necessary Conse∣quence? Moreover, not only the Faith of the Saints, and Church of God of old, is hereby ren∣der'd uncertain, but also the Faith of all sorts of Christians now, is liable to the like hazard; even of those who seek a Foundation for their Faith else∣where, than from the Spirit. For I shall prove by an inevitable Argument, <HI>ab Incommodo,</HI> i. e. from the Inconveniency of it, that if the Spirit be not to be followed upon that account, and that Men may not depend upon it, as their Guide, because some, while pretending thereunto, commit great Evils; that then, nor Tradition, nor the Scriptures, nor Reason, which the <HI>Papists, Protestants</HI> and <HI>Soci∣nians,</HI> do respectively make the Rule of their Faith, are any whit more certain.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1.</HI> Instances of Tradi∣tion.</NOTE> The <HI>Romanists</HI> reckon it an Error to Celebrate <HI>Easter</HI> any other ways than that Church doth.

<PB N="56" REF="003129_0035_0FF0044640E0E638"/>
to decide the case, that <HI>Polycarpus,</HI> the Disciple of <HI>John,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Euseb.</HI> Hist.

Would the <HI>Papists</HI> now judge we dealt fairly by them, if we should thence aver, That Tradition is not to be regarded? Besides, in a matter of far greater Importance, the same difficulty will occur, to wit, in the Primacy of the Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI>; for many do affirm, and that by Tradition, That in the first Six Hundred Years the <HI>Roman Prelates</HI> never assumed the Title of <HI>Universal Shepherd,</HI> nor were acknowledged as such. And, as that which altogether overturneth this Persidency, there are that alledge, and that from Tradition also, That <HI>Peter</HI> never saw <HI>Rome</HI>; and that therefore the Bi∣shop of <HI>Rome</HI> cannot be his Successor. Would ye <HI>Romanists</HI> think this sound Reasoning, to say, as ye do?</P>
<P>Many have been deceived, and erred grievously, in trusting to Tradition.</P>
<P>Therefore we ought to reject all Traditions, yea, even those by which we affirm the contrary, and as we think prove the Truth.</P>

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As to the Scripture, the same difficulty occurreth: The <HI>Lutherans</HI> affirm they believe Con∣substantiation, by the Scripture, which the <HI>Calvinists</HI> deny; as that which (they say) according to the same Scripture, is a gross Error.

<P>Here the <HI>Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Arminians</HI> grosly err, by following the Scripture:</P>
<P>Therefore the Scripture is not a good and certain Rule; and <HI>e contra.</HI></P>
<P>Would either of them accept of this Reasoning as good and sound? What shall I say of the <HI>Episco∣palians, Presbyterians, Independents,</HI> and <HI>Anabaptists</HI> of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who are continually buffering one another with the Scripture? To whom the same Argument might be alledged, tho' they do all una∣nimously acknowledge it to be the Rule.</P>
<P>And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> As to Reason, I shall not need to say much; for whence come all the Controversies,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>3.</HI> Of Rea∣son.</NOTE> Contentions and Debates in the World, but be∣cause every Man thinks he follows right Reason?<NOTE PLACE="marg">The debates hence aris∣ing betwixt the old and late <HI>Philo∣sophers.</HI></NOTE> Hence of old, came the Jangles betwixt the <HI>Stoicks, Platonists, Peripateticks, Pythagoreans,</HI> and <HI>Cynicks</HI>; as of late, betwixt the <HI>Aristotelians, Cartesians,</HI> and o∣ther Naturalists: Can it be thence inferred, or will the <HI>Socinians,</HI> those great Reasoners, allow us to conclude, because many, and that very wise Men, have erred, by following (as they supposed) their Reason, and that with what Diligence, Care and Industry they could, to find out the Truth, that therefore no Man ought to make use of it at all, nor be positive in what he knows certainly to be Rational?

<PB N="58" REF="003129_0036_0FF00448EE4E4B38"/>
to have been authorised by these Rules. I need but mention all the Tumults, Seditions and horrible Bloodshed, wherewith <HI>Europe</HI> hath been afflicted these divers Ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; in which <HI>Papists</HI> against <HI>Papists, Calvinists</HI> against <HI>Calvinists.

<P>For what have the <HI>Papists</HI> pretended for their many <HI>Massacres,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tradition, Scripture, and Reason made a Co∣ver for Per∣secution &amp; Murder.</NOTE> acted as well in <HI>France,</HI> as else∣where, but <HI>Tradition, Scripture</HI> and <HI>Reason?</HI> Did they not say, That <HI>Reason</HI> perswaded them, <HI>Tradi∣tion</HI> allowed them, and <HI>Scripture</HI> commanded them to Persecute, Destroy, and Burn <HI>Hereticks,</HI> such as denied this plain Scripture, <HI>Hoc est Corpus meum, This is my Body?</HI> And are not the Protestants as∣senting to this Bloodshed, who assert the same thing, and encourage them, by Burning and Ba∣nishing, while their Brethren are so treated for the same Cause? Are not the Islands of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> (yea, and all the Christian World) a lively Example hereof, which were divers Years together as a Theatre of Blood where many lost their Lives, and Numbers of Families were utter∣ly destroyed and ruined? For all which, no other cause was principally given than the Precepts of the Scripture. If we then compare these Actings with those of <HI>Munster,</HI> we shall not find great dif∣ference; for both affirmed and pretended they were called, and that it was lawful to Kill, Burn, and Destroy the Wicked. <HI>We must Kill all the Wicked,</HI> said those <HI>Anabaptists; that we that are the Saints, may possess the Earth.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If it be said, <HI>The</HI> Anabaptists <HI>went without, and against the Authority of the</HI> Magistrate; <HI>so did not the other.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I might easily Refute it, by alledging the mutual Testimonies of these <HI>Sects</HI> against one another. The Behaviour of the <HI>Papists</HI> towards <HI>Henry</HI> the third and fourth of <HI>France</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Examples of <HI>Popish</HI> Cruelties.</NOTE> their designs upon <HI>James</HI> the sixth in the Gun-Powder-Treason; as also their Principle of the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Power to depose Kings, for the cause of <HI>Heresie,</HI> and to absolve their subjects from their <HI>Oath,</HI> and give them to others, proves it against them.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>Protestants,</HI> how much their Actions differ from those other above-mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Protestant Violences and Perse∣cutions in <HI>Scotland, England</HI> &amp; <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE> may be seen by the many Conspiracies and Tumults, which they have been active in, both in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> and which they have acted within these Hun∣dred Years, in divers Towns and Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands.</HI> Have they not often times sought, not only from the <HI>Popish Magistrates,</HI> but even from those that had begun to Reform, or that had given them some liberty of Exercising their Religion, that they might only be permitted, without Trouble or Hinderance, to Exercise their Religion, promi∣sing they would not hinder or molest the <HI>Papists</HI> in the Exercise of theirs? And yet did they not on the contrary, so soon as they had Power, trouble and abuse those Fellow-Citizens, and turn them
<PB N="60" REF="003129_0037_0FF0044B46318E58"/>
out of the City, and which is worse, even such, who together with them, had forsaken the Popish Religion? Did they not these things in many Places against the Mind of the Magistrates? Have they not publickly with contumelious Speeches, assaulted their Magistrates, from whom they had but just before sought and obtained the free Exer∣cise of their Religion? Representing them, so soon as they opposed themselves to their <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> as if they regarded neither God nor Religion? Have they not by violent Hands possessed themselves of the <HI>Popish Churches,</HI> so called, or by Force, against the Magistrates Mind, taken them away? Have they not turned out of their Office and Authority whole Councils of Magistrates, under Pretence, that they were addicted to <HI>Popery?</HI> Which <HI>Popish Ma∣gistrates</HI> nevertheless they did but a little before acknowledge to be ordained by God; affirming themselves obliged to yield them Obedience and Subjection, not only for Fear, but for Conscience sake; to whom moreover the very Preachers and Overseers of the Reformed Church had willingly sworn Fidelity; and yet afterwards have they not said, That the People are bound to force a wicked Prince to the Observation of God's Word? There are many other Instances of this kind to be found in their <HI>Histories,</HI> not to mention many worse things, which we know to have been acted in our Time, and which for Brevity's sake I pass by.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lutheran</HI> Seditions against the Reformed Teachers, &amp; Assault upon the Marquess of <HI>Bran∣denburgh,</HI> &amp;c. in <HI>Germany.</HI></NOTE>I might say much of the <HI>Lutherans,</HI> whose tu∣multuous Actions against their Magistrates, not professing the <HI>Lutheran Profession,</HI> are testified of by several Historians worthy of Credit. Among others, I shall propose only one Example to the Readers Consideration, which fell out at <HI>Berlin,</HI> in the Year, 1615.
<Q>Where the seditious Multitude of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Citizens, being stirred up by the daily Clamours of their Preachers, did not only violently take up the Houses of the Reformed
<PB N="61" REF="003129_0037_0FF0044B46318E58"/>
Teachers, overturn their Libraries, and spoil their Furniture; but also with reproachful Words, yea, and with Stones, assaulted the Marquess of <HI>Bran∣denburgh,</HI> the Elector's Brother, while he sought by smooth Words to quiet the Fury of the Mul∣titude: They killed ten of his Guard, scarcely sparing himself; who at last, by Flight, escaped out of their Hands.</Q></P>
<P>All which sufficiently declares, that the Concur∣rence of the Magistrate doth not alter their Prin∣ciples, but only their Method of Procedure. So that for my own part, I see no Difference betwixt the Actings of those of <HI>Munster,</HI> and these others, (whereof the one pretended to be led by the Spirit, the other by Tradition, Scripture and Reason) save this; that the former were rash, heady and foolish, in their Proceedings, and therefore were sooner brought to nothing, and so into Contempt and Derision: But the other being more Politick and Wise in their Generation, held it out longer, and so have authorized their Wickedness more, with seeming Authority of Law and Reason. But both their Actings being equally Evil, the Difference ap∣pears to me to be only like that which is betwixt a simple filly Thief, that is easily catched, and hanged without any more ado; and a Company of resolute bold Robbers, who being better guarded, tho' their Offence be nothing less, yet by Violence do (to evite the Danger) force their Masters to give them better Terms.</P>
<P>From all which then it evidently follows, that they argue very ill, that despise and reject any Principle, because Men, pretending to be led by it, do evil; in case it be not the natural and conse∣quential Tendency of that Principle, to lead unto those Things that are evil.</P>
<P>Again, It doth follow from what is above as∣serted, that if the Spirit be to be rejected upon this Account, all those other Principles ought on the
<PB N="62" REF="003129_0038_0FF0044CE4B3D020"/>
same account to be rejected. And for my part, as I have never a whit the lower esteem of the Blessed Testimony of the Holy Scriptures; nor do the less respect any solid Tradition, that is answerable and according to Truth; neither at all despise Reason, that noble and excellent Faculty of the Mind, be∣cause wicked Men have abused the Name of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Let none re∣ject the Cer∣tainty of the Unerr∣ng Spirit of God, because of false Per∣tenders to it.</NOTE> to cover their Wickedness, and deceive the Simple: So I would not have any reject or diffide the Cer∣tainty of that Unerring Spirit, which God hath given his Children, as that which can alone guide them into all Truth, because some have falsly pre∣tended to it.</P>
<P N="15">§. XV. And because the Spirit of God is the Fountain of all Truth and found Reason, there∣fore we have well said, That <HI>it cannot contradict neither the Testimony of the Scripture, nor right Reason: Yet</HI> (as the Proposition it self concludeth, to whose last part I now come) <HI>it will not from thence follow, that these Divine Revelations are to be subjected to the Examination either of the outward Testimony of Scrip∣ture, or of the humane or natural Reason of Man, as to a more noble and certain Rule and Touch stone; for the Divine Revelation, and Inward Illumination, is that which it evident by it self, forcing the well disposed Un∣derstanding, and irresistibly moving it to assent, by its own Evidence and Clearness, even as the common Prin∣ciples of natural Truths do bow the Mind to a natural Assent.</HI></P>
<P>He that denies this part of the Proposition, must needs affirm, that the Spirit of God neither can nor ever hath manifested it self to Man, without the Scripture, or a distinct discussion of Reason; or that the Efficacy of this Supernatural Principle, working upon the Souls of Men, is less evident than Natural Principles in their common Operati∣ons; both which are false.</P>
<P>For <HI>First,</HI> Through all the Scriptures we may ob∣serve, That the Manifestation and Revelation of
<PB N="63" REF="003129_0038_0FF0044CE4B3D020"/>
God by his Spirit, to the Patriarchs, Prophets and Apostles, was <HI>Immediate</HI> and <HI>Objective,</HI> as is above proved; which they did not examine by any other Principle, but their own Evidence and Clearness.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Self-Evidence of the <HI>Spirit.</HI></NOTE> To say that the Spirit of God has less Evidence upon the Mind of Man, than Natural Principles have, is to have too mean and too low Thoughts of it. How comes <HI>David</HI> to invite us, to <HI>taste, and see that God is good,</HI> if this cannot be felt and tasted? This were enough to overturn the Faith and Assurance of all the Saints, both now and of old. How came <HI>Paul</HI> to be perswaded, that <HI>nothing could separate him from the Love of God,</HI> but by that Evidence and Clearness, which the Spirit of God gave him? The Apostle <HI>John,</HI> who knew well wherein the Certainty of Faith consisted, judg∣ed it no ways absurd, without further Argument, to ascribe his Knowledge and Assurance, and that of all the Saints hereunto, in these Words, <HI>Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his</HI> Spirit, 1 <HI>John</HI> 4.13. And again, 5, 6. It's <HI>the</HI> Spirit <HI>that beareth witness, be∣cause the</HI> Spirit is Truth.</P>
<P>Observe the Reason brought by him, <HI>Because the Spirit is Truth:</HI> Of whose Certainty and Infallibility I have heretofore spoken. We then trust to and confide in this Spirit, because we know, and cer∣tainly believe, that it can only lead us aright, and never mis-lead us; and from this certain Confidence it is that we affirm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Spirit</HI> contradicts not Scrip∣ture, nor right Rea∣son.</NOTE> That no Revelation coming from it, can ever contradict the Scriptures Testi∣mony, nor right Reason: Not as making this a more certain Rule to our selves, but as condescending to such, who not discerning the Revelations of the Spirit, as they proceed purely from God, will try them by these <HI>Mediums.</HI> Yet those that have their Spiritual Senses, and can favour the things of the Spirit, as it were <HI>in prima instantia,</HI> i. e. at the first Blush, can discern them without, or before they
<PB N="64" REF="003129_0039_0FF0044F99AD41E8"/>
apply them either to Scripture or Reason: Just as a good <HI>Astronomer</HI> can calculate an Eclipse infal∣libly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Natural Demon∣strations from <HI>A∣stronomy</HI> and <HI>Geo∣metry.</HI></NOTE> by which he can conclude (if the Order of Nature continue, and some strange and unnatural Revolution intervene not) there will be an Eclipse of the Sun or Moon such a Day, and such an Hour; yet can he not perswade an ignorant Rustick of this, until he visibly see it. So also a <HI>Mathematician</HI> can infallibly know, by the Rules of Art, that the three Angles of a right Triangle, are equal to two right Angles; yea, can know them more certainly, than any Man by Measure. And some <HI>Geometrical De∣monstrations</HI> are by all acknowledged to be infallible, which can be scarcely discerned or proved by the Senses; yet if a <HI>Geometer</HI> be at the Pains to certify some ignorant Man concerning the Certainty of his Art, by condescending to measure it, and make it obvious to his Senses, it will not thence follow, that that Measuring is so certain as the Demonstration it self; or that the Demonstration would be un∣certain without it.</P>
<P N="16">§. XVI. But to make an End, I shall add one Ar∣gument to prove, That this inward, Immediate, Objective Revelation, which we have pleaded for all along, is the only, sure, certain, and unmoveable Foundation of all <HI>Christian Faith:</HI> Which Argument, when well weighed, I hope will have Weight with all Sorts of Christians; and it is this:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Immediate Revelation of all Chri∣stian Faith, the Im∣moveable Foundation</NOTE>That which all Professors of <HI>Christianity,</HI> of what Kind soever, are forced ultimately to recur unto, when pressed to the last, That for and because of which all other Foundations are recommended, and accounted worthy to be believed, and without which they are granted to be of no Weight at all, must needs be the only most true, certain, and un∣moveable Foundation of all Christian Faith.</P>
<P>But Inward, immediate, Objective Revelation, by the Spirit, is that which all Professors of <HI>Christiani∣ty,</HI> of what kind soever, are forced ultimately to re∣cur unto, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<PB N="65" REF="003129_0039_0FF0044F99AD41E8"/>
<P><HI>Therefore,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Proposition is so evident, that it will not be denied; The Assumption shall be proved by Parts.</P>
<P>And <HI>First</HI>; As to the <HI>Papists,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Papists</HI> Foundation their Church and Tradition, <HI>Why?</HI></NOTE> they place their Foundation in the Judgment of the <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Tra∣dition.</HI> If we press them to say, Why they believe as the Church doth; Their Answer is, <HI>Because the Church is always led by the</HI> Infallible Spirit. So here the Leading of the Spirit, is the utmost Foundation. Again, if we ask them, Why we ought to trust <HI>Tradition</HI>? They answer, <HI>Because these Traditions were delivered us by the Doctors and Fathers of the Church; which Doctors and Fathers, by the Revelation of the</HI> Holy Ghost, <HI>commanded the Church to observe them.</HI> Here again all ends in the Revelation of the Spirit.</P>
<P>And for the <HI>Protestants</HI> and <HI>Socinians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Protestants</HI> and <HI>Socini∣ans</HI> make the Scrip∣tures their Ground &amp; Foundation <HI>Why?</HI></NOTE> both which acknowledge the Scriptures to be the Foundation and Rule of their Faith; the one is subjectively in∣fluenced by the Spirit of God to use them; the other, as managing them with and by their own Reason. Ask both, or either of them, Why they trust in the Scriptures, and take them to be their Rule? Their Answer is, <HI>Because we have in them the Mind of God delivered unto us, by those, to whom these Things were inwardly, immediately, and objectively revealed by the</HI> Spirit <HI>of God</HI>; and not because this or that Man wrote them, but because the Spirit of God dictated them.</P>
<P>It is strange then,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Christians</HI> by Name, and not by Nature, hold Reve∣lation cea∣sed, con∣trary to Scripture.</NOTE> that Men should render that so uncertain and dangerous to follow, upon which alone the certain Ground and Foundation of their own Faith is built; or that they should shut them∣selves out from that Holy Fellowship with God, which is only enjoyed in the Spirit, in which we are commanded both to walk and live.</P>
<P>If any, reading these Things, find themselves mo∣ved, by the Strength of these Scripture Arguments,
<PB N="66" REF="003129_0040_0FEFD7304E8BF020"/>
to assent, and believe such Revelations neccessary; and yet find themselves strangers to them (which, as I observed in the beginning, is the cause that this is so much gain-said and contradicted) Let them know, that it is not because it is ceased to become the Priviledge of every true Christian, that they do not feel it; but rather because they are not so much Christians by Nature, as by Name: And let such know, that the secret <HI>Light,</HI> which shines in the Heart, and reproves Unrighteousness, is the small Beginning of the Revelation of God's Spirit, which was first sent into the World to reprove it of Sin, <HI>John</HI> 16.8. And as, by forsaking Iniqui∣ty, thou com'st to be acquainted with that Hea∣venly Voice in thy Heart, thou shalt feel, as the Old Man, or the Natural Man, that savoureth not the things of God's Kingdom, is put off, with his evil and corrupt Affections and Lusts; I say, thou shalt feel the New Man, or the Spiritual Birth and Babe raised, which hath its Spiritual Senses, and can see, feel, taste, handle, and smell the things of the Spirit; but till then, the knowledge of things Spiritual, is but as an Historical Faith. But as the description of the Light of the Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who wants his Sight, sees not the Light.</NOTE> or of curious Colours, to a Blind Man, who, tho' of the largest capacity, cannot so well understand it, by the most acute and lively Description, as a Child can by seeing them: So neither can the Natural Man, of the largest capacity, by the best words, even Scripture-words, so well understand the <HI>Mysteries</HI> of <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Kingdom,</HI> as the least and weakest Child who tasteth them, by having them Revealed <HI>inwardly</HI> and <HI>ob∣jectively</HI> by the Spirit.</P>
<P>Wait then for this, in the small Revelation of that pure Light, which first reveals things more known; and as thou becom'st fitted for it, thou shalt receive more and more, and by a Living Ex∣perience easily refute their Ignorance, who ask, How dost thou know, that thou art acted by the
<PB N="67" REF="003129_0040_0FEFD7304E8BF020"/>
Spirit of God? Which will appear to thee a Que∣stion no less ridiculous, than to ask one, whose Eyes are open, How he knows the Sun shines at Noon-Day? And tho' this be the surest and certainest way to answer all Objections; yet by what is above writ∣ten, it may appear, that the Mouths of all such Op∣posers, as deny this Doctrine, may be shut, by un∣questionable and unanswerable Reasons.</P>

<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD><HI>PROPOSITION III.</HI> Concerning the Scriptures.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>From these Revelations of the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> to the Saints, have proceeded the <HI>Scriptures of Truth,</HI> which contain,
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>I.</HI> A faithful Historical Account of the Actings of God's People in divers Ages; with many singular and re∣markable Providences attending them.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>II.</HI> A Prophetical Account of several things, whereof some are already past, and some yet to come.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>III.</HI> A full and ample Account of all the chief Principles of the Doctrine of Christ, held forth in divers precious Declarations, Exhortations and Sentences, which, by the <HI>moving of God's Spirit,</HI> were at several times, and upon sundry occasions, spoken and written unto some Churches and their Pastors.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Nevertheless, because they are only a Declaration of the Fountain, and not the Fountain it self; therefore they are not to be esteemed the principal Ground of all Truth and Knowledge, nor yet the adequate, primary Rule of Faith and Manners. Yet, because they give a true and faithful Testimony of the first Foundation, they are and may be esteemed a secondary Rule, sub∣ordinate to the <HI>Spirit,</HI> from which they have all their Excellency &amp; Certainty: For, as by the inward Testi∣mony of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> we do alone truly know them; so they testify, That the <HI>Spirit</HI> is that Guide, by which the Saints are led into all Truth; therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 16.13 Rom. 8.14</NOTE> according to
<PB N="68" REF="003129_0041_0FF0045182C2DD08"/>
the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> the Spirit is the first and principal Leader. Seeing then, that we do therefore receive and believe the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> because they proceeded from the <HI>Spirit;</HI> for the very same Reason is the <HI>Spirit</HI> more originally and principally the Rule, according to the received Maxim in the Schools, <HI>Propter quod unum∣quodque est tale, illud ipsum est magis tale</HI>: That for which a thing is such, the thing it self is more such.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">§. I. THE former Part of this Proposition, tho' it needs no Apology for it self, yet it is a good Apology for us, and will help to sweep away that, among many other Calumnies, wherewith we are often loaded, as if we were Vilifiers and De∣niers of the Scriptures; for in that which we affirm of them, it doth appear at what a high Rate we value them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Holy Scriptures the most Excellent Writings in the World.</NOTE> accounting them (without all Deceit and Equivocation) the most excellent Writings in the World; to which not only no other Writings are to be preferr'd, but even in divers Respects not comparable thereto. For, as we freely acknow∣ledge, that their Authority doth not depend upon the Approbation of Canons of any Church, or As∣sembly; so neither can we subject them to the fallen, corrupt, and defiled Reason of Man: And therein, as we do freely agree with the <HI>Protestants,</HI> against the Error of the <HI>Romanists</HI>; so on the other Hand, we cannot go the Length of such <HI>Protestants,</HI> as make their Authority to depend upon any Virtue or Power, that is in the Writings themselves; but we desire to ascribe all to that Spirit, from which they proceeded.</P>
<P>We confess indeed, there wants not a Majesty in the Stile, a Coherence in the Parts, a good Scope in the Whole; but seeing these things are not dis∣cerned by the Natural, but only by the Spiritual Man, it is the Spirit of God that must give us that Belief of the Scriptures, which may satisfie our Consciences. Therefore some of the chiefest
<PB N="69" REF="003129_0041_0FF0045182C2DD08"/>
among <HI>Protestants,</HI> both in their particular Writings, and publick Confessions, are forced to acknowledge this.</P>
<P>Hence <HI>Calvin,</HI> tho' he saith, he is able to prove,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Calvin</HI>'s Testimony, That the Scriptures Certainty is from the Spirit.</NOTE> that if there be a God in Heaven, these Writings have proceeded from him; yet he concludes ano∣ther Knowledge to be necessary: <HI>Instit. lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 7. <HI>Sect</HI> 4.</P>
<P><Q>But if (saith he) we respect the Consciences, that they be not daily molested with Doubts, and stick not at every Scruple, it is requisite that this Perswasion which we speak of, be taken higher than Humane Reason, Judgment, or Conjectures; to wit, from the secret Testi∣mony of the Holy Spirit. <HI>And again,</HI> To those that ask, that <HI>we prove unto them by Reason, that</HI> Moses <HI>and the Prophets were inspired of God to speak:</HI> I Answer, That the Testimony of the Holy Spirit is more excellent than all Reason.</Q>
<HI>And again,</HI>
<Q>Let this remain a firm Truth, That he only whom the Holy Ghost hath perswaded, can repose himself on the Scripture with a true Certainty. <HI>And lastly,</HI> This then is a Judgment, which cannot be begotten, but by a Heavenly Revelation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The same is also affirmed in the first publick Con∣fession of the <HI>French Churches,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Confes∣sion of the <HI>French</HI> Churches.</NOTE> published in the Year 1559. <HI>Art.</HI> 4.
<Q>We know these Books to be Cano∣nical, and the most certain Rule of our Faith, not so much by the common Accord and Consent of the Church, as by the Testimony, and inward Perswasion of the Holy Spirit.</Q></P>
<P>Thus also in the 5th Article of the Confession of Faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Churches of <HI>Holland</HI> assert the same.</NOTE> of the Churches of <HI>Holland</HI> affirmed by the Synod of <HI>Dort.</HI>
<Q>We receive the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Books only for Holy and Canonical, not so much because the Church receives and approves them, as because the Spirit of God doth witness in our Hearts, that they are of God.</Q></P>
<PB N="70" REF="003129_0042_0FEFD72A0EE20B18"/>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Westmin∣ster</HI> Confes∣sion the same.</NOTE>And lastly, The <HI>Divines,</HI> so called, at <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI> who began to be afraid of, and guard against the Testimony of the Spirit, because they percei∣ved a Dispensation beyond that which they were under, beginning to dawn, and to eclipse them; yet they could not get by this, tho' they have laid it down, neither so clearly, distinctly, nor honestly. as they that went before. It is in these Words, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1. <HI>Sect.</HI> 5.

<P N="2">§. II. Tho' then we do acknowledge the Scrip∣tures to be a very Heavenly and Divine Writing, the Use of them to be very Comfortable and Ne∣cessary to the Church of Christ, and that we also admire, and give Praise to the Lord, for his won∣derful Providence, in preserving these Writings so pure and uncorrupted, as we have them, through so long a Night of Apostacy, to be a Testimony of his Truth, against the Wickedness and Abomi∣nations, even of those, whom he made instrumental in preserving them; so that they have kept them to be a Witness against themselves; yet we may not call them the principal Fountain of all Truth and Knowledge, nor yet the first adequate Rule of Faith and Manners, because the principal Fountain of Truth, must be the Truth it self, <HI>i. e.</HI> That,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scrip∣tures are not the principal Ground of Truth.</NOTE> whose Certainty and Authority depends not upon another. When we doubt of the Streams of any River or Flood, we recur to the Fountain it self, and having found it, there we desist, we can go no further; because there it springs out of the Bowels of the Earth, which are inscrutable. Even so the Writings and Sayings of all Men, we must bring to the Word of God, I mean the Eternal Word, and if they agree hereunto, we stand there; for this Word always proceedeth, and doth eternally pro∣ceed from God, in and by which the unsearchable Wisdom of God, and unsearchable Counsel, and Will conceived in the Heart of God, is revealed unto us. That then the Scripture is not the princi∣pal Ground of Faith and Knowledge, as it appears by what is above spoken; so it is provided in the latter Part of the Proposition, which being reduced to an Argument, runs thus:</P>
<P>That, whereof the Certainty and Authority de∣pends upon another, and which is received as Truth, because of its proceeding from another, is not to be accounted the principal Ground and Origin of all Truth and Knowledge.</P>
<PB N="72" REF="003129_0043_0FF004562D6287C0"/>
<P>But the Scriptures Authority and Certainty de∣pend upon the Spirit, by which they were dictated; and the Reason why they were received as Truth, is, because they proceeded from the Spirit.</P>
<P>Therefore they are not the principal Ground of Truth.</P>
<P>To confirm this Atgument, I added the School-Maxim, <HI>Propter quod unumquodque est tale, illud ipsum magis est tale.</HI> Which Maxim, tho' I confess it doth not hold universally, in all things; yet in this it both doth and will very well hold, as by applying it, as we have above intimated, will appear.</P>
<P>The same Argument will hold, as to the other Branch of the Proposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Neither are they the primary Rule of Faith and Manners.</NOTE> <HI>That it is not the primary adequate Rule of Faith and Manners</HI>; thus:</P>
<P>That which is not the Rule of my Faith in be∣lieving the Scriptures themselves, is not the pri∣mary adequate Rule of Faith and Manners:</P>
<P>But the Scripture is not, nor can it be the Rule of that Faith, by which I believe them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Spirit is the Rule.</NOTE>But as to this Part, we shall produce divers Ar∣guments hereafter, as to what is affirmed, That the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and <HI>not the Scriptures, is the Rule,</HI> it is large∣ly handled in the former Proposition, the Sum where∣of I shall subsume in one Argument, thus:</P>
<P>If by the Spirit we can only come to the true Knowledge of God: If by the Spirit we are to be led into all Truth, and so be taught of all Things; Then the Spirit, and not the Scriptures, is the Foundation and Ground of all Truth and Knowledge, and the primary Rule of Faith and Manners.</P>
<P>But the first is true; Therefore also the last.</P>
<P>Next, The very Nature of the Gospel it self declareth, That the Scriptures cannot be the <HI>only</HI> and <HI>chief Rule</HI> of <HI>Christians,</HI> else there should be no Difference betwixt the <HI>Law</HI> and the <HI>Gospel.</HI> As from the Nature of the New Covenant, by divers
<PB N="73" REF="003129_0043_0FF004562D6287C0"/>
Scriptures, described in the former Proposition, is proved.</P>
<P>But besides these which are before mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wherein the Law and Gospel differ.</NOTE> herein doth the Law and the Gospel differ, in that the Law being outwardly written, brings under <HI>Condemnation,</HI> but hath not <HI>Life</HI> in it to <HI>save</HI>; whereas the <HI>Gospel,</HI> as it declares and makes mani∣fest the Evil, so it being an Inward Powerful Thing, gives Power also to obey, and deliver from the Evil. Hence it is called <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which is <HI>Glad Tidings</HI>; the <HI>Law</HI> or <HI>Letter,</HI> which is <HI>without</HI> us, <HI>kills</HI>: But the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which is the <HI>inward</HI> Spiritual <HI>Law,,</HI> gives <HI>Life</HI>; for it consists not so much in Words, as in Vertue. Wherefore such as come to know it, and be acquainted with it, come to feel greater Power over their Iniquities, than all outward Laws or Rules can give them. Hence the Apostle concludes, Rom. 6.14. <HI>Sin shall not have Dominion over you: For ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</HI> This Grace then, that is <HI>Inward,</HI> and not an <HI>Outward</HI> Law, is to be the Rule of Christians: Hereunto the Apostle commends the Elders of the Church, saying, Acts 20.32. <HI>And now, Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the Word of his Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an In∣heritance among all them which are sanctified.</HI> He doth not commend them here to outward Laws or Writings, but to the <HI>Word of Grace,</HI> which is Inward, even the <HI>Spiritual Law,</HI> which makes free, as he elsewhere affirms, Rom. 8.2. <HI>The Law of the</HI> Spirit of Life <HI>in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death.</HI> This Spiritual Law is that which the Apostle declares he preached and directed People unto, which was not outward, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.8. is manifest; where, distinguishing it from the Law, he saith, <HI>The Word is nigh thee, in thy Heart, and in thy Mouth; and this is the Word of Faith which we preach.</HI> From what is abovesaid, I argue thus:</P>
<PB N="74" REF="003129_0044_0FF00458B6D28008"/>
<P><LIST TYPE="syllogism">
<ITEM>The principal Rule of Christians under the Gospel, is not an outward Letter, nor Law outwardly writ∣ten and delivered; but an inward Spiritual Law, <HI>ingraven in the Heart, the Law of the Spirit of Life, the Word that is nigh, in the Heart and in the Mouth.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>But the Letter of the Scripture is outward, of it self a dead thing, a meer Declaration of good things, but not the things themselves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore it is not, nor can be, the chief or prin∣cipal Rule of Christians.</ITEM></LIST></P>
<P N="3"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scrip∣ture not the Rule.</NOTE>§. III. <HI>Thiirdly</HI> That which is given to Christians for a Rule and Guide, must needs be so full, as it may clearly and distinctly guide and order them in all things and Occurrences that may fall out.</P>
<P>But in that there are many hundreds of things, with a regard to their Circumstances, particular Christians may be concerned in, for which, there can be no particular Rule had in the Scriptures:</P>
<P>Therefore the Scriptures cannot be a Rule to them.</P>
<P>I shall give an Instance in two or three Particu∣lars, for to prove this Proposition. It is not to be doubted, but some Men are particularly called to some particular Services; their being not found in which, tho' the Act be no general positive Duty; yet in so far as it may be required of them, is a great Sin to omit: For as much as God is zealous of his Glory, and every Act of Disobedience to his Will manifested, is enough not only to hinder one greatly from that Comfort and inward Grace, which otherwise they might have, but also bringeth Con∣demnation.</P>
<P>As for Instance: Some are called to the Ministry of the Word; <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>There was a necessity upon him to preach the Gospel; Wo unto me, if I preach not.</HI></P>
<P>If it be necessary that there he now Ministers of the Church, as well as then, then there is the same Necessity upon some, more than upon others, to oc∣cupy this Place; which Necessity, as it may be in∣cumbent
<PB N="75" REF="003129_0044_0FF00458B6D28008"/>
upon particular Persons, the Scripture nei∣ther doth nor can declare.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If it be said, <HI>That the Qualifications of a Minister are found in the Scripture, and by applying these Qua∣lifications to my self, I may know whether I be fit for such a Place or no.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer, The Qualifications of a <HI>Bishop,</HI> or <HI>Mi∣nister,</HI> as they are mentioned both in the Epistle to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> are such as ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e found in a private Christian; yea, which ought is some mea∣sure to be in every true Christian: So that, that giveth a Man no Certainty. Every Capacity to an Office, giveth me not a sufficient Call to it.</P>
<P>Next again, By what Rule shall I judge, if I be so qualified? How do I know that I am <HI>sober, meek, holy, harmless?</HI> Is not the Testimony of the Spirit in my Conscience that which must assure me hereof? And suppose that I was Qualified and Called, yet what Scripture-Rule shall inform me, whether it be my duty to preach in this or that place, in <HI>France</HI> or <HI>England, Holland</HI> or <HI>Germany</HI>; Whether I shall take up my Time in confirming the Faithful, Re∣claiming Hereticks, or Converting Infidels, as also in Writing Epistles to this or that Church?</P>
<P>The general Rules of the Scripture, viz. <HI>To be diligent in my Duty, to do all to the</HI> Glory of God, <HI>and for the good of his Church,</HI> can give me no light in this thing. Seeing two different things may both have a respect to that way, yet may I commit a great Error and Offence, in doing the one, when I am called to the other. If <HI>Paul,</HI> when his Face was turned by the Lord toward <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> had gone back to <HI>Achaia,</HI> or <HI>Macedonia,</HI> he might have supposed he could have done God more acceptable Service, in Preaching and confirming the Churches, than in be∣ing shut up in Prison in <HI>Judea</HI>; but would God have been pleased herewith? Nay certainly. <HI>Obedience is better than Sacrifice</HI>; and it is not our doing that which is good simply, that pleaseth God, but that
<PB N="76" REF="003129_0045_0FF0045B1770CB20"/>
good which he willeth us to do. Every Member hath its particular place in the Body, as the Apo∣stle sheweth, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. If then, I being the Foot, should offer to exercise the Office of the Hand; or being the Hand, that of the Tongue, my Service would be troublesome, and not acceptable; and instead of helping the Body, I should make a <HI>Schism</HI> in it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">That which is good for one to do, may be sin∣ful to ano∣ther.</NOTE> So that, that which is good for another to do, may be sinful for me: For, as Masters will have their Servants to obey them, according to their good pleasure, and not only in blindly doing that, which may seem to them to tend to their Master's profit; whereby it may chance (the Master having business both in the Field and in the House) that the Servant, that knows not his Master's will, may go to the Field, when it is the mind of the Master he should stay, and do the business of the House: Would not this Servant then deserve a Reproof, for not answering his Master's mind? And what Master is so sottish and careless, as having many Servants, leaves them in such disorder, as not to assign each his particular Station, and not only the general term of, Doing that which is profitable; which would leave them in various doubts, and no doubt, end in confusion?</P>
<P>Shall we then dare to ascribe unto Christ, in the ordering of his Church and Servants, that which in Man might justly be accounted Disorder and Confusion? The Apostle sheweth this distinction well,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diversities of Gifts.</NOTE> <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.6, 7, 8. <HI>Having then Gifts differing ac∣cording to the Grace that is given to us; whether Pro∣phecy, let us prophesie according to the proportion of Faith, or Ministry, let us wait on our Minstiring; or he that Teacheth, on Teaching; or he that Exhorteth, on Exhor∣tation.</HI> Now what Scripture-Rule sheweth me, that I ought to Exhort, rather than Prophesie? or to Minister, rather than Teach? Surely none at all. Many more Difficulties of this kind, occur in the Life of a Christian.</P>
<PB N="77" REF="003129_0045_0FF0045B1770CB20"/>
<P>Moreover, That which of all things is most needful for him to know, to wit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Salva∣tion can</HI> the Scripture assure thee?</NOTE> whether he really be in the Faith, and an Heir of Salvation, or no, the Scripture can give him no certainty in, neither can it be a Rule to him. That this Knowledge is exceeding desirable and comfortable, all do unani∣mously acknowledge; besides, that it is especially commanded, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5. <HI>Examine your selves, whe∣ther ye be in the Faith, prove your selves; know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates?</HI> And 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10. <HI>Wherefore the rather Brethren, give all diligence to make your Calling and Election sure.</HI> Now, I say, what Scripture-Rule can assure me, that I have true Faith? That my Calling and Election is sure?</P>
<P>If it be said, <HI>By comparing the</HI> Scripture-Marks <HI>of true Faith with mine:</HI></P>
<P>I demand, Wherewith shall I make this Obser∣vation? What shall ascertain me, that I am not mistaken? It cannot be the Scripture: That's the Matter under Debate.</P>
<P>If it be said, <HI>My own Heart</HI>:</P>
<P>How unfit a Judge is it in its own case? And how like to be partial, especially if it be yet unrenewed?<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Heart of Man de∣ceitful.</NOTE> Doth not the Scripture say, That <HI>it is deceitful above all things?</HI> I find the Promises, I find the Threat∣nings, in the Scripture; but who telleth me, that the one belongs to me, more than the other? The <HI>Scripture</HI> gives me a meer Declaration of these things, but makes no Application; so that the Assumption must be of my own making, thus; as for Example: I find this Proposition in the Scripture;</P>
<P><HI>He that believes, shall be saved:</HI> Thence I draw this Assumption,</P>
<P>But I, <HI>Robert, believe</HI>:</P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>I shall be saved.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Minor</HI> is of my own making, not expressed in the Scripture; and so a Humane Conclusion, not a Divine Position; so that my Faith and Assurance
<PB N="78" REF="003129_0046_0FF0045D8CBC6BF8"/>
here, is not built upon a Scripture Proposition, but upon a Humane Principle; which, unless I be sure of elsewhere, the Scripture gives me no certainty in the matter.</P>
<P>Again, If I should pursue the Argument further, and seek a new <HI>Medium</HI> out of the Scripture, the same difficulty would occur, thus:</P>
<P>He that hath the true and certain Marks of true Faith hath true Faith.</P>
<P>But I have those Marks:</P>
<P><HI>Therefore,</HI> I have true Faith.</P>
<P>For the Assumption is still here of my own ma∣king, and is not found in the Scriptures; and by consequence the Conclusion can be no better, since it still followeth the weaker Proposition. This is indeed so pungent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inward Testimony of the Spirit the Seal of Scripture. Promises.</NOTE> that the best of Protestants, who plead for this Assurance, ascribe it to the in∣ward Testimony of the Spirit, (as <HI>Calvin,</HI> in that large Citation, cited in the former Proposition) so that, not to seek further into the Writings of the Primitive Protestants, (which are full of such Expressions) even the <HI>Westminster</HI> Confession of Faith affirmeth, <HI>Chap</HI> 18. <HI>Sect.</HI> 12.
<Q>This certainty is not a bare Conjecture and probable Perswasion, grounded upon Fallible Hope, but an Infallible Assurance of Faith, founded upon the Divine Truth of the Promise of Salvation; the inward Evidences of these Graces, unto which these Pro∣mises are made; the Testimony of the Spirit of Adoption, witnessing to our Spirits, that we are the Children of God; which Spirit is the <HI>Earnest</HI> of our <HI>Inheritance, whereby we are sealed to the day of Redemption.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Moreover, The Scripture it self, wherein we are so earnestly pressed to seek after this Assurance, doth not at all affirm it self a <HI>Rule</HI> sufficient to give it, but wholly ascribeth it to the Spirit, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.16. <HI>The</HI> Spirit <HI>it self heareth witness with our spirit, that we are the Children of God.</HI> 1 John 4.13. <HI>Hereby know we
<PB N="79" REF="003129_0046_0FF0045D8CBC6BF8"/>
that we dwell in him, and be in us, because he hath given us of his</HI> Spirit; and chap 5.6. <HI>And it is the</HI> Spirit <HI>that beareth witness, because the</HI> Spirit <HI>is Truth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">§. IV. <HI>Lastly,</HI> That cannot be the only,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Scriptures are not the chief Rules</NOTE> principal nor chief Rule, which doth not universally reach every Individual, that needeth it, to produce the necessary effect; and from the use of which (either by some innocent and sinless Defect, or Natural, yet harmless and blameless Imperfection) many (who are within the compass of the visible Church, and may, without absurdity, yea, with great pro∣bability, be accounted of the Elect) are necessarily Excluded, and that either wholly, or at least from the immediate use thereof. But it so falls out fre∣quently concerning the Scriptures,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1.</HI> Deaf Peo∣ple, Chil∣dren and Idiots In∣stanced.</NOTE> in the case of Deaf People, Children and Idiots, who can by no means have the benefit of the Scriptures. Shall we then affirm, that they are without any Rule to God∣ward, or that they are all damned? As such an Opi∣nion is in it self very absurd, and inconsistent both with the Justice and Mercy of God, so I know no sound Reason can be alledged for it. Now if we may suppose any such to be under the <HI>New Covenant Dispensation,</HI> as I know none will deny; but that we may suppose it without any absurdity, we cannot sup∣pose them without some Rule and Means of Know∣ledge; seeing it is expresly affirmed, <HI>They shall all be taught of God,</HI> John 6.45. <HI>And they shall know me from the least to the greatest,</HI> Heb. 8.11. But Secondly, Though we were rid of this difficulty, how many illiterate, and yet good Men, are there in the Church of God, who cannot read a Letter in their own Mothers Tongue? Which Imperfection, tho' it be inconvenient, I cannot tell whether we may safely affirm it to be sinful; these can have no im∣mediate Knowledge of the Rule of their Faith: So their Faith must needs depend upon the credit of other Men's Reading or Relating it unto them; where either the altering, adding, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> omitting of a

But further, suppose all could read the Scriptures in their own Language, where is there one of a Thousand that hath that through Knowledge of the Original Languages, in which they are writ∣ten, so as in that respect immediately to receive the benefit of them?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>3.</HI> The Un∣certainty of the <HI>Inter∣preters</HI> of the Scrip∣tures, and their Ad∣ulterating it.</NOTE> Must not all these here depend upon the Honesty and Faithfuless of the Inter∣preters? Which how uncertain it is for a Man to build his Faith upon, the many Corrections, A∣mendments, and various Essays, which even among Protestants have been used, whereof the latter have constantly blamed and corrected the former, as guilty of Defects and Errors, doth sufficiently de∣clare. And that even the last Translations in the vulgar Languages need to be corrected (as I could prove at large, were it proper in this place) learned Men do confess. But last of all, there is no less difficulty even occurs to these skilled in the Original Languages, who cannot so immediately receive the Mind of the Authors in these Writings, as that their Faith doth at least obliquely depend upon the Honesty and Credit of the Transcribers, since the Original Copies are granted by all not to be now extant.</P>

And the many various Lections in divers Copies of the Greek, and the great Alterations among the Fathers of the first three Centuries (who had greater opportunity to be better informed, than we can now lay claim to) concerning the Books to be admitted or rejected, as is above observed. I say, all these, and much more which might be alledged, puts the Minds, even of the Learned, into infinite Doubts, Scruples, and inextricable Difficulties: Whence we may very safely conclude, That Jesus Christ, who promised to be <HI>always</HI> with his Children, to lead them into <HI>all Truth,</HI> to guard them against the Devices of the Enemy, and to establish their Faith upon an <HI>un∣moveable Rock,</HI> left them not to be principally ruled by that, which was subject in it self to many un∣certainties: And therefore he gave them his <HI>Spirit,</HI>

as their principal Guide, which neither Moths nor Time can wear out, nor Transcribers nor Translators corrupt; which none are so Young, none so Illiterate none in so remote a Place, but they may come to be reached, and rightly informed by it.</P>
<P>Through and by the Clearness which that Spirit gives us, it is that we are only best rid of those difficulties that occur to us, concerning the Scrip∣tures. The real and undoubted Experience whereof I my self have been a Witness of, with great Ad∣miration of the Love of God to his Children in these latter days: For I have known some of my Friends, who profess the same Faith with me, faithful Servants of the most high God, and full of Divine Knowledge of his Truth, as it was im∣mediately and inwardly revealed to them by the Spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wrong Translati∣ons of Scrip∣tures dis∣cerned in the Spirit, by the un∣learned in Letters.</NOTE> from a true and living Experience; who not only were ignorant of the Greek and Hebrew, but even some of them could not read their own vulgar Language; who being pressed by the Ad∣versaries with some Citations out of the <HI>English</HI> Translation, and finding them to disagree with the Manifestation of Truth in their Hearts, have boldly affirmed the Spirit of God never said so; and that it was certainly wrong: For they did not believe that any of the Holy Prophets, or Apostles, had ever written so; which, when I on this account seriously examined, I really found to be Errors and Corruptions of the Translators: Who, as in most Translations, do not so much give us the genuine Signification of the Words, as strain them to ex∣press that, which comes nearest to that Opinion and Notion they have of Truth.

<P>God is Teacher of his People himself; and there is nothing more express, than that such as are un∣der the New Covenant, they <HI>need no Man to teach them</HI>: Yet it was a fruit of Christ's Ascension, to send Teachers and Pastors, for perfecting of the Saints. So that the same Work is ascribed to the Scriptures, as to Teachers; the one to make the Man of God perfect, the other for the Perfection of the Saints.</P>
<P>As then Teachers are not to go before the Teaching of God himself, under the New Cove∣nant, but to follow after it; neither are they to rob us of that great Priviledge, which Christ hath purchased unto us by his <HI>Blood</HI>; so neither is the Scripture to go before the Teaching of the Spirit, or to rob us of it.</P>

we have with the same Spirit and Work in our Hearts. The Prophecies of the Scriptures are also very comfortable and profitable unto us, as the same Spirit inlightens us, to observe them fulfilled, and to be fulfilled: For in all this, it is to be observed, that it is only the Spiritual Man that can make a right use of them: They are able to make the Man of God perfect, (so it is not the Natural Man) and whatsoever was written afore∣time, was written for <HI>our comfort, [our]</HI> that are the Believers, [<HI>our</HI>] that are the Saints; concerning such the Apostle speaks: For as for the other, the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> plainly declares, that the <HI>unstable and unlearned wrest them to their own Destruction</HI>: These were they that were unlearned in the Divine and Heavenly Learning of the Spirit, not in Humane and School Literature; in which, we may safely presume, that <HI>Peter</HI> himself, being a Fisher-man, had no skill; for it may, with great probability, yea certainty, be affirmed, that he had no know∣ledge of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Logick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Logick.</NOTE> which both Papists and Protestants, now degenerating from the Simplicity of Truth, make the Hand-maid of Divinity (as they call it) and a necessary Introduction to their car∣nal, natural and humane Ministry. By the infinite obscure Labours of which kind of Men, mixing in their Heathenish Stuff, the Scripture is rendred at this day of so little service to the simple People: Whereof if <HI>Jerom</HI> complained in his time, now Twelve Hundred Years ago, <HI>Hierom</HI> Epist. 134. ad <HI>Cypr.</HI> tom. 3. saying, <HI>It is wont to befal the most part of Learned Men, that it is harder to understand their Expositions, than the things which they go about to Ex∣pound</HI>; What may we say then, considering those great Heaps of Commentaries since, in Ages yet far more corrupted?</P>

the Church of God; wherefore we do account them a Secondary Rule.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Scrip∣tures a se∣condary Rule.</NOTE> Moreover, because they are commonly acknowledged by all, to have been written by the Dictates of the Holy Spirit, and that the Errors, which may be supposed by the Injury of Times to have slipt in are not such, but that there is a sufficient clear Testimony left to all the Essentials of the Christian Faith; we do look upon them, as the only fit outward Judge of Con∣troversies among Christians; and that whatsoever Doctrine is contrary unto their Testimony, may therefore justly be rejected as False. And for our parts, we are very willing, that all our Doctrines and Practices be tried by them; which we never refused, nor ever shall, in all Controversies with our Adversaries, as the Judge and Test. We shall also be very willing to admit it, as a positive cer∣tain Maxim, <HI>That whatsoever any do, pretending to the</HI> Spirit, <HI>which is contrary to the</HI> Scriptures, <HI>be ac∣counted and reckoned a Delusion of the Devil.</HI> For as we never lay claim to the Spirit's Leadings, that we may cover our selves in any thing that is Evil; so we know, that as every Evil contradicts the Scriptures, so it doth also the Spirit in the first place, from which the Scriptures came, and whose Motions can never contradict one another, tho' they may appear sometimes to be contradictory to the Blind Eye of the Natural Man, as <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>James</HI> seem to contradict one another.</P>
<P>Thus far we have shewn both what we believe, and what we believe not, concerning the Holy Scriptures; hoping, we have given them their due place. But since they that will needs have them to be the Only, Certain and Principal Rule, want not some shew of Arguments, even from the Scripture it self (tho' it no where call it self so) by which they labour to prove their Doctrine; I shall briefly lay them down by way of Objections, and Answer them, before I make an end of this mattter.</P>

<P N="7"><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="1"/> §. VII. Their first Objection is usually drawn from <HI>Isaiah</HI> 8.20. <HI>To the Law and to the Testimony; if they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no Light in them.</HI> Now this <HI>Law, Testimony,</HI> and <HI>Word,</HI> they plead to be the Scriptures.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="1"/> To which I Answer; That that is to beg the thing in Question; and remains yet unproved. Nor do I know, for what reason we may not safe∣ly affirm this <HI>Law</HI> and <HI>Word</HI> to be <HI>Inward:</HI> But suppose it was <HI>Outword,</HI> it proves not the case at all for them, neither makes it against us; for it may be confessed, without any prejudice to our Cause, That the outward Law was more parti∣cularly to the <HI>Jews</HI> a Rule, and more principally than to us; seeing their Law was Outward and Literal, but ours under the New Covenant, (as hath been already said) is expresly affirmed to be <HI>Inward</HI> and <HI>Spiritual</HI>: So that this Scripture is so far from making against us, that it makes for us;<NOTE PLACE="marg">To try all things, by what?</NOTE> for if the <HI>Jews</HI> were directed to try all things by their Law, which was without them, written in Tables of Stone; then if we will have this Advice of the Prophet to reach us, we must make it hold parallel to that Dispensation of the Gospel which we are under: So that we are to try all things (in the first place) by that <HI>Word of Faith,</HI> which is preached unto us, which the Apostle saith, is <HI>in the Heart</HI>; and by that Law, which God hath given us, which the Apo∣stle saith also expresly, <HI>is written and placed in the Mind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly</HI>; If we look to this place, according to the Greek Interpretation of the <HI>Septuagint,</HI> out Adver∣saries shall have nothing from thence to carp; yea, it will favour us much: For there it is said, that <HI>the Law is given us for a help</HI>; which very well agrees, with what is above asserted.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="2"/> Their second Objection is from <HI>John</HI> 5.39. <HI>Search the Scriptures,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="88" REF="003129_0051_0FF004C9669486A0"/>
<P><HI>Here,</HI> say they, <HI>we are commanded,</HI> by Christ him∣self, <HI>to search the</HI> Scriptures.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="1"/> I Answer, <HI>First</HI>; That the Scriptures ought to be searched, we do not at all deny; but are very willing to be tryed by them, as hath been above-declared: But the Question is, <HI>Whether they be the Only and Principal Rule</HI>? Which this is so far from proving, that it proveth the contrary; for Christ checks them here, for too high an esteem of the Scriptures, and neglecting of him that was to be preferred before them, and to whom they bare witness; as the following words declare. <HI>For in them ye think ye have Eternal Life, and they are they which testifie of me:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Search the Scriptures, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>And ye will not come unto me, that ye might have Life.</HI> This shews, that while they thought, they had Eternal Life in the Scrip∣tures, they neglected to come unto Christ, to have Life, of which the Scriptures bore witness. This answers well to our purpose, since our Adversaries now do also exalt the Scriptures, and think to have Life in them; which is no more, than to look upon them as the only principal Rule, and Way to Life; and yet refuse to come unto the Spirit, of which they restifie, even the inward Spi∣ritual Law, which could give them Life: So that the cause of this Peoples Ignorance and Unbelief, was not their want of respect to the Scriptures; which tho' they knew, and had a high esteem of; yet Christ testifies in the former Verses, that they had neither <HI>seen the Father, nor heard his Voice at any time; neither had his Word abiding in them</HI>; which had they then had, then they had believed in the Son. <MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="2"/> Moreover, that place may be taken in the Indicative Mood, <HI>Ye search the Scriptures</HI>; which Interpretation the Greek word will bear, and so <HI>Pasor</HI> translateth it: Which by the reproof following, seemeth also to be the more genuine In∣terpretation, as <HI>Cyrillus</HI> long ago hath observed.</P>
<PB N="89" REF="003129_0051_0FF004C9669486A0"/>
<P N="8">§. VIII. Their Third Objection is from these words, <HI>Acts</HI> 17.11. <HI>These were more noble than those in</HI> Thessalonica, <HI>in that they recieved the Word with all readiness of mind, and searched the</HI> Scriptures <HI>daily, whether those things were so.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="3"/> <HI>Here,</HI> say they, <HI>the Bereans are commended,</HI> for <HI>searching the</HI> Scriptures, <HI>and making them the Rule.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="1"/> I answer; That the Scriptures either are the prin∣cipal or only Rule, will not at all from this follow; neither will their searching the Scriptures, or being commended for it, infer any such thing: For we recommend and approve the use of them, in that respect, as much as any; yet will it not follow, that we affirm them to be the principal and only Rule.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="2"/> <HI>Secondly</HI>; It is to be observed, that these were the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Berea,</HI> to whom these Scriptures, which were the Law and the Prophets,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bere∣ans</HI> search∣ing the Scriptures, make them not the on∣ly Rule to try Do∣ctrines.</NOTE> were more particularly a Rule; and the thing under Examination was, whether the Birth, Life, Works, and Sufferings of Christ, did answer to the Prophecies that went before of him; so that it was most proper for them, being <HI>Jews,</HI> to examine the Apostle's Doctrine by the Scriptures, seeing he pleaded it to be a fulfilling of them. It is said nevertheless in the first place, That <HI>they received the Word with chearfulness</HI>; and in the second place, <HI>They searched the Scriptures:</HI> Not that they searched the Scriptures, and then received the Word; for then could they not have prevailed to Convert them, had they not first minded the <HI>Word abiding in them,</HI> which opened their Understandings; no more, than the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees,</HI> who (as in the former Objection we observed) searched the Scriptures, and exalted them, and yet remained in their Unbelief; because they had not the <HI>Word abiding in them.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="3"/> But <HI>Lastly,</HI> If this Commendation of the <HI>Jewish Bereans</HI> might infer, That the Scriptures were the only and principal Rule to try the Apostles
<PB N="90" REF="003129_0052_0FF0046A12C85980"/>
Doctrine by; what should have become of the <HI>Gentiles</HI>? How should they ever have come to have received the Faith of Christ, who neither knew the Scriptures, nor believed them? We see in the end of the same Chapter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Athe∣nians</HI> in∣stanced.</NOTE> how the Apostle, preaching to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> took another method, and directed them to somewhat of God <HI>within</HI> themselves, that they might <HI>feel after him.</HI> He did not go about to Proselyte them to the <HI>Jewish Religion,</HI> and to the Belief of the <HI>Law</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and from thence to prove the Coming of Christ, nay, he took a nearer way. Now certainly, the Principal and only Rule is not different; one to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and another to the <HI>Gentiles</HI>; but is <HI>Universal,</HI> reaching both: Tho' secondary and subordinate Rules and Means may be various, and diversly suited, accord∣ing as the People, they are used to, are Stated and Circumstantiated: Even so we see, that the Apo∣stle to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> used a Testimony of one of their own Poets, which he judged would have Credit with them: And, no doubt, such Testi∣monies whose Authors they esteemed, had more weight with them, then all the Sayings of <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> whom they never knew nor would have cared for. Now because the Apostle used the Testimony of a Poet to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> will it therefore follow, he made that the Principal, or only Rule to try his Doctrine by? So neither will it follow, that tho' he made use of the Scriptures to the <HI>Jews,</HI> as being a Principle already believed by them, to try his Doctrine, that from thence the Scriptures may be accounted the Principal or only Rule.</P>
<P N="9"><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="4"/> §. IX. The last, and that which at first view seems to be the greatest Objection, is this:</P>
<P><HI>If the</HI> Scripture <HI>be not the adequate, principal, and only Rule, then it would follow, that the</HI> Scripture <HI>is not compleat, nor the Canon filled; that if Men be now im∣mediately Led and Ruled by the</HI> Spirit, <HI>they may add new</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="003129_0052_0FF0046A12C85980"/>
Scriptures, <HI>of equal authority with the old; whereas every one that adds, is cursed: Yea, what assurance have we, but at this rate every one may bring in a new Gospel according to his fancy?</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> The dangerous Consequences insinuated in this Objection, were fully answered in the later part of the last Proposition, in what was said a little before; offering freely to disclaim all pretended Revelations, contrary to the Scriptures.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="1"/> But if it be urged, <HI>That it is not enough to deny these Consequences if they naturally follow from your Do∣ctrine of Immediate Revelation, and denying the</HI> Scripture <HI>to be the only Rule.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="1"/> I Answer; We have proved both these Doctrines to be true and necessary, according to the Scrip∣tures themselves; and therefore to fasten evil Con∣sequences upon them, which we make appear do not follow, is not to accuse us, but Christ and his Apostles, who preached them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="2"/> But <HI>Secondly</HI>: We have shut the Door upon all such Doctrine, in this very Position; affirming, <HI>That the</HI> Scriptures <HI>give a full and ample Testimony to all the principal Doctrines of the Christian Faith.</HI> For we do firmly believe, that there is no other Gospel or Doctrine to be preached, but that which was de∣livered by the Apostles; and do freely subscribe to that saying, <HI>Let him that preacheth any other</HI> Gospel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 1.8.</NOTE> <HI>than that which hath been already preached by the Apo∣stles, and according to the</HI> Scriptures, <HI>be accursed.</HI></P>
<P>So we distinguish betwixt a Revelation of a <HI>new Gospel,</HI> and <HI>new Doctrines,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Re∣velation is not a new Gospel.</NOTE> and a <HI>new Revelation</HI> of the <HI>good old Gospel</HI> and <HI>Doctrines</HI>; the last we plead for, but the first we utterly deny. For we firmly believe. That <HI>no other foundation can any Man lay, than that, which is laid already.</HI> But that this Re∣velation is necessary, we have already proved; and this doth sufficiently guard us against the hazard insinuated in the Objection.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="003129_0053_0FF0046C675440A8"/>
<P>As to the Scriptures being a <HI>filled Canon,</HI> I see no necessity of believing it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Books Ca∣nonical.</NOTE> And if these Men, that believe the Scriptures to be the only Rule, will be consistent with their own Doctrine, they must needs be of my Judgment; seeing it is simply impossible to prove the Canon by the Scriptures. For it can∣not be found in any Book of the Scriptures, that these Books, and just these, and no other, are Ca∣nonical, as all are forced to acknowledge; how can they then evite this Argument?</P>
<P>That, which cannot be proved by Scripture, is no necessary Article of Faith.</P>
<P>But the Canon of the Scripture; to wit, that there are so many Books precisely, neither more or less, cannot be proved by Scripture.</P>
<P><HI>Therefore,</HI> it is no necessary Article of Faith.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="2"/> If they should alledge, <HI>That the admitting of any other Books to be now written by the</HI> same Spirit, <HI>might infer the admission of new Doctrines.</HI></P>
<P>I deny that Consequence; for the Principal or Fundamental Doctrines of the Christian Religion, are contained in the tenth part of the Scripture; but it will not follow thence, that the rest are im∣pertinent, or useless. If it should please God to bring to us any of those Books, which by the in∣jury of time are lost, which are mentioned in the Scripture;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oks lost.</NOTE> as, <HI>The Prophecy of Enoch; the Book of Nathan,</HI> &amp;c. or <HI>the Third Epistle of Paul to the Co∣rinthians</HI>; I see no reason, why we ought not to receive them, and place them with the rest. That which displeaseth me, is, that Men should first affirm, that the Scripture is the only and principal Rule, and yet make a great <HI>Article of Faith</HI> of that, which the Scripture can give us no light in.</P>
<P>As for Instance: How shall a Protestant prove by Scripture, to such, as deny the <HI>Epistle of James</HI> to be Authentick, that it ought to be received?</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> If he would say, <HI>Because it Contradicts not the rest,</HI> (besides that there is no mention of it in
<PB N="93" REF="003129_0053_0FF0046C675440A8"/>
any of the rest;) perhaps these Men think, it doth contradict <HI>Paul,</HI> in relation to <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Works.</HI> But if that should be granted, it would as well follow, that every Writer, that Contradicts not the Scrip∣ture, should be put into the Canon. And by this means, these Men fall into a greater Absurdity, than they fix upon us: For thus they would equal every one the Writings of their own Sect with the Scrip∣tures; for I suppose they judge, their own Confession of Faith doth not Contradict the Scriptures: Will it therefore follow, that it should be bound up with the Bible? And yet it seems impossible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether the Epistle of <HI>James</HI> be Authen∣tick, and how to know it.</NOTE> according to their Principles, to bring any better Argument, to prove the <HI>Epistle of James</HI> to be Authentick. There is then this unavoidable necessity to say, We know it by the same Spirit, from which it was writ∣ten; or otherwise to step back to <HI>Rome,</HI> and say, We know by Tradition, that the Church hath declared it to be Canonical; and the Church is Infallible. Let them find a Mean, if they can. So that out of this Objection, we shall draw an Unanswerable Ar∣gument <HI>ad hominem,</HI> to our purpose.</P>
<P>That, which cannot assure me, concerning an Article of Faith, necessary to be believed, is not the primary, adequate, only Rule of Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But the Scripture cannot thus assure me:</P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I prove the Assumption thus:</P>
<P>That, which cannot assure me concerning the Canon of the Scripture, to wit, that such Books are only to be admitted, and the <HI>Apocrypha</HI> excluded, cannot Assure me of this:</P>
<P>Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="3"/> And <HI>Lastly,</HI> As to these words <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.18. <HI>That if any Man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the Plagues that are written in this Book</HI>: I desire they will shew me how it relates to any thing else than to that particular Prophecy. <MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> It saith not <HI>Now the Canon of the Scripture is filled up, no Man is to
<PB N="94" REF="003129_0054_0FF0046F191E5028"/>
write more from that Spirit</HI>; yea, do not all confess, that there have been Prophecies, and true Prophets since? The <HI>Papists</HI> deny it not. And do not the <HI>Protestants affirm,</HI> that <HI>John Hus</HI> prophesied of the <HI>Reformation?</HI> Was he therefore Cursed? Or did he therein Evil? I could give many other Examples, confessed by themselves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What it means to add to the Scriptures.</NOTE> But moreover, the same was in effect commanded long before, <HI>Prov.</HI> 30.6. <HI>Add thou not unto his words, least he reprove thee, and thou be found a Lyar</HI>: Yet how many Books of the Prophets were written after? And the same was said by <HI>Moses,</HI> Deut. 4.2. <HI>Ye shall not add unto the Word which I command you; neither shall ye diminish ought from it.</HI> So that, tho' we should extend that of the <HI>Revelation,</HI> beyond the particular Prophecy of that Book, it cannot be understood, but of a new Gospel, or new Doctrines, or of restraining Man's spirit, that he mix not his Humane Words with the Divine; and not of <HI>of a new Revelation of the Old,</HI> as we have said before.</P>

<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Part I.</NOTE>§. II. As to the first, not to dive into the many curious Notions, which many have, concerning the <HI>Condition of Adam before the Fall</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adam<HI>'s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all.</HI></NOTE> all agree in this, That thereby he came to a very great Loss, not only in the things which related to the outward Man, but in regard of that true Fellowship and Communion he had with God. This Loss was signified unto him in the Command, <HI>For in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely dye,</HI> Gen. 2.17. This Death could not be an outward Death, or the Dissolution of the outward Man, for as to
<PB N="97" REF="003129_0055_0FF0047101611A88"/>
that, he did not dye yet many Hundred Years af∣ter; so that it must needs respect his Spiritual Life, and communion with God. The Consequence of this Fall, besides that which relates to the Fruits of the Earth, is also expressed, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.20. <HI>So he drove out the Man, and he placed at the East of the Garden of</HI> Eden <HI>Cherubims, and a Flaming Sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the Tree of Life.</HI> Now whatsoever literal Signification this may have, we may safely ascribe to this Paradise, a mystical Signification, and truly account it that Spiritual Communion and Fellowship, which the Saints obtain with God by Jesus Christ; to whom only these Cherubims give way, and unto as many as enter by him, who calls himself the <HI>Door.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Guilt not ascribed to <HI>Adam</HI>'s Po∣sterity.</NOTE> So that, tho' we do not ascribe any whit of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Guilt to Men, until they make it theirs by the like Acts of Disobedience; yet we cannot suppose, that Men, who are come of <HI>Adam</HI> naturally, can have any good thing in their Nature as belong∣ing to it; which he, from whom they derive their Nature, had not himself to Communicate unto them.</P>
<P>If then we may affirm, that <HI>Adam</HI> did not retain in his Nature (as belonging thereunto) any Will or Light capable to give him Knowledge in Spiri∣tual Things, then neither can his Posterity: For whatsoever real good any Man doth, it proceedeth not from his Nature, as he is Man, or the Son of <HI>Adam</HI>; but from the <HI>Seed of God in him,</HI> as a new Visitation of Life, in order to bring him out of this Natural Condition: So that, though it be <HI>in him,</HI> yet it is not <HI>of him</HI>; and this the Lord him∣self witnessed, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.5. where it is said, He <HI>saw that every imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was only evil continually.</HI> Which words,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Every Ima∣gination of the Natu∣ral Man is evil.</NOTE> as they are very Positive, so are they very Comprehensive.

admits of no Exception of any Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart, <HI>Secondly, Is only evil con∣tinually</HI>; it is neither in <HI>some part evil continually,</HI> nor yet <HI>only</HI> evil <HI>at sometimes</HI>; but both <HI>only</HI> evil, and <HI>always</HI> and <HI>continually</HI> evil; which certainly excludes any good, as a proper effect of Man's Heart, naturally: For that which is only evil, and that always, cannot of its own Nature pro∣duce any good thing. The Lord expresseth this again, a little after, chap. 8.21. <HI>The Imagination of Man's Heart is evil from his Youth.</HI> Thus inferring how natuaral and proper it is unto him; from which I thus argue:</P>
<P><LIST TYPE="syllogism">

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Heart of Man de∣ceitful.</NOTE><HI>Secondly,</HI> This appears clearly from that Saying of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> chap. 17.9. <HI>The Heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked.</HI> For who can, with any Colour of Reason, imagine, that That which is so, hath any Power of it self; or is any wise fit to lead a Man to Righteousness, where∣unto it is of its own Nature directly opposite? This is as contrary to Reason, as it is impossible in Nature, that a Stone of its own Nature, and proper Motion, should flee upwards: For, as a Stone of its own Nature inclineth and is prone to move downwards towards the Centre; so the Heart of Man is naturally prone and inclined to Evil; some to one, and some to another. From this then I also thus argue:</P>

<P><LIST TYPE="syllogism">
<ITEM>That which is <HI>deceitful above all things, and despe∣rately wicked,</HI> is not fit, neither can it lead a Man aright, in things that are good and honest.</ITEM>
<ITEM>But the Heart of Man is such:</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM></LIST></P>
<P>But the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> describeth the Condition of Man in the Fall, at large,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 3.10. Psal. 14 34 &amp; 53. 2, &amp;c.</NOTE> taking it out of the <HI>Psal∣mist. There is none righteous, no not one; There is none that understandeth, there is none that secketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become unprofitable; there is none that doth good, no not one. Their Throat is an open Sepulchre,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Man's E∣state in the Fall.</NOTE> with their Tongues they have used Deceit, the Poison of Asps is under their Lips: Whose Mouths are full of Cursing and Bitterness. Their Feet are swift to shed Blood; Destruction and Mi∣sery are in their ways: And the way of Peace have they not known. There is no fear of God before their Eyes.</HI> What more positive can be spoken? He seemeth to be particularly careful to avoid, that any good should be ascribed to the Natural Man, he shews how he is polluted in all his Ways; he shews how he is void of Righteousness, of Understanding, of the Know∣ledge of God, how he is out of the Way; and in short, Unprofitable; than which, nothing can be more fully said, to confirm our Judgment: For if this be the Condition of the Natural Man, or of Man as he stands in the Fall, he is unfit to make one right step to Heaven.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If it be said, <HI>That is not spoken of the Condition of Man in general; but only of some particulars; or at the least, that it comprehends not all.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> The Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sheweth the clear contrary, in the foregoing Verses; where the Apostle takes in him∣self, as he stood in his Natural Condition: <HI>What then? Are we better than they? No, in no wise; for we have before proved both</HI> Jews <HI>and</HI> Gentiles, <HI>that they are all under Sin, as it is written</HI>: And so he goes on. By which it is manifest, that he speaks of Mankind in general.</P>
<PB N="100" REF="003129_0057_0FF0047563EF7680"/>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If they Object, that which the same Apostle saith in the foregoing Chapter, <HI>vers.</HI> 14. to wit. That <HI>the</HI> Gentiles <HI>do by Nature the things contained in the Law, and so consequently do by Nature that which is good and acceptable in the sight of God.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="1"/> I answer; This Natute must not, neither can be understood of <HI>Mans own Nature,</HI> which is cor∣rupt and fallen; but of the <HI>Spiritual Nature,</HI> which proceedeth from the <HI>Seed of God in Man,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">By what nature the <HI>Gentiles</HI> did do the things of the Law.</NOTE> as it receiveth a new Visitation of God's Love, and is quickned by it: Which clearly appears by the fol∣lowing words, where he saith; <HI>These not having a Law,</HI> (i. e. outwardly) <HI>are a Law unto themselves, which shews the work of the Law, written in their Hearts.</HI> These Acts of theirs then, are an effect of the Law written in their Hearts; but the Scripture de∣clareth, that the Writing of the Law in the Heart, is a part, yea, and a great part too, of the New Covenant Dispensation; and so no consequence not part of Man's Nature.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="2"/> <HI>Secondly</HI>; If this Nature, here spoken of, could be understood of Man's own Nature, which he hath as he is a Man, then would the Apostle unavoidably contradict himself; since he elsewhere positively declares,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The natu∣ral <HI>Man</HI> discerneth not, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>That the Natural Man discerneth not the things of God, nor can.</HI> Now I hope, the Law of God is among the things of God, especially as it's written in the Heart. The Apostle, in the 7th Chapter of the same Epistle, saith, vers. 12. That <HI>the Law is Holy, Just, and Good</HI>; and vers. 14. That <HI>the Law is Spiritual, but he is Carnal.</HI> Now in what respect is he Carnal, but as he stands in the Fall, Unregenerate? Now what inconsistency would here be, to say. That he is Carnal, and yet not so of his own Nature; seeing it is from his Nature that he is so denominated? We see the Apostle contra-distinguisheth the Law, as Spiritual, from Man's Nature, as Carnal and Sinful. Wherefore, as Christ saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 7.16</NOTE> <HI>There can no Grapes be expected from
<PB N="101" REF="003129_0057_0FF0047563EF7680"/>
Thorns, nor Figs of Thiftles</HI>; so neither can the ful∣filling of the Law, which is Spiritual, Holy and Just, be expected from that Nature, which is Cor∣rupt, Fallen and Unregenerate. Whence we con∣clude, with good Reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Gent∣iles</HI> Spirit∣ual Na∣ture, in do∣ing the Law.</NOTE> that the Nature here spoken of, by which the <HI>Gentiles</HI> are said to have done the <HI>things contained in the Law,</HI> is not the <HI>common Nature of Man</HI>; but that <HI>Spiritual Nature</HI> that ariseth from the Works of the Righteous and Spiritual Law, that's written in the Heart. I con∣fess, they of the other extream, when they are pressed with this Testimony by the <HI>Socinians</HI> and <HI>Pelagians,</HI> as well as by us, when we use this Scrip∣ture, to shew them, how some of the <HI>Heathens</HI> by the <HI>Light of Christ in their Heart,</HI> come to be saved, are very far to seek; giving this answer, That <HI>ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were some Reliques of the Heavenly Image left in</HI> Adam, <HI>by which the</HI> Heathens <HI>could do some good things.</HI> Which, as it is in it self without proof, so it can∣tradicts their own Assertions elsewhere, and gives away their Cause. For if these Reliques were of force, to enable them to fulfil the Righteous Law of God, it takes away the Necessity of Christ's Coming; or, at least leaves them a way to be saved without him; unless they will say, (which is worst of all) <HI>That tho' they really fulfilled the Righteous Law of God; yet God damned them, because of the want of that particular Knowledge, while he himself with-held all means of their coming to him, from them</HI>: But of this hereafter.</P>
<P N="3">§. III. I might also here use another Argument, from these words of the Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. where he so positively excludes the Natural Man from an understanding in the things of God; but because I have spoken of <HI>that Scripture</HI> in the beginning of the Second Proposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Socinians</HI> exalting the Light of the na∣tural Man.</NOTE> I will here avoid to repeat what is there mentioned, referring thereunto: Yet because the <HI>Socinians,</HI> and others, who exalt the Light of the Natural Man, or a Natural Light in Man, do

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> They say, <HI>The Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ought to be tran∣slated</HI> Animal, <HI>and not Natural; else,</HI> say they, <HI>it would have been</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. From which they seek to infer, <HI>That it is only the Animal Man, and not the Rational, that is excluded here, from the discerning the things of God.</HI> Which <HI>shift,</HI> without disputing about the Word, is easily refuted; neither is it any wise consistent with the scope of the place. For,</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="1"/> First, The <HI>Animal Life</HI> is no other than that which Man hath common with other Living Crea∣tures;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ani∣mal Man is the same with Na∣tural.</NOTE> for as he is a meer Man, he differs no other∣wise from Beasts, than by the <HI>Rational Property.</HI> Now the Apostle deduceth his Argument in the foregoing Verses, from this <HI>Simile</HI>; That <HI>as the things of a Man cannot be known, but by the spirit of a Man; so the things of God, no Man knoweth, but by the Spirit of God.</HI> But I hope these Men will confess unto me, that the things of a Man are not known by the <HI>Animal Spirit</HI> only <HI>i. e.</HI> by that which he hath common with the Beasts; but by the <HI>Rational</HI>: So that it must be the <HI>Rational,</HI> that is here understood. Again, the Assumption shews clearly that the A∣postle had no such intent, as these Men's gloss would make him to have? viz. <HI>So the things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God:</HI> According to their Judgment he should have said, <HI>The things of God knoweth no Man by his Animal Spirit, but by his Rational Spirit:</HI> For to say, <HI>The Spirit of God,</HI> here spoken of, is no other than the <HI>Rational Spirit of Man,</HI> would border upon Blasphemy, since they are so often cantra-distinguished. Again, going on he saith not, that they are <HI>Rationally,</HI> but <HI>Spiritually discerned.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="2"/> <HI>Secondly,</HI> The Apostle, throughout this Chapter, shews how the Wisdom of Man is unfit to judge of the things of God, and ignorant of them. Now I ask these Men, Whether a Man be called a <HI>Wise
<PB N="103" REF="003129_0058_0FF0047859774D68"/>
Man</HI> from his <HI>animal Property,</HI> or from his <HI>Rational</HI>?<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ratio∣nal Man, in the Na∣tural State excluded from dis∣cerning the things of God.</NOTE> If from his <HI>Rational,</HI> then it is not only the <HI>Animal,</HI> but also the <HI>Rational,</HI> as he is yet in the Natural State, which the Apostle excludes here, and whom he contra distinguisheth from the Spiritual, vers 15. <HI>But the spiritual Man judgeth all things</HI>; this cannot be said of any Man, meerly because <HI>Rational,</HI> or as he is a Man; seeing the Men of greatest Reason, if we may so esteem Men, whom the Scripture calls <HI>Wise</HI> as were the <HI>Greeks</HI> of old, not only may be, but often are enemies to the Kingdom of God; while both the <HI>Preaching of Christ</HI> is said to be <HI>Foolishness with the Wise Men of this World,</HI> and the <HI>Wisdom of this World</HI> is said to be <HI>Foolishness with God.</HI> Now whether it be any ways probable, that either these Wise Men, that are said to account the <HI>Gospel foolishness,</HI> are only so called with respect to their <HI>Animal Property,</HI> and not their <HI>Rational</HI>; or that the <HI>Wisdom,</HI> that is Foolishness with God, is not meant of the <HI>Rational,</HI> but only the <HI>Animal Property,</HI> any Rational Man, laying aside Interest, may easily judge.</P>
<P N="4">§. IV. I come now to the other part, to wit,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Infants,</HI> no Sin impu∣ted to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> that <HI>this evil and corrupted Seed is not imputed to In∣fants, until they actually joyn with it.</HI> For this there is a Reason given in the end of the Proposition it self, drawn from <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. <HI>For these are by Nature Children of Wrath, who walk according to the Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit that now worketh in the Children of Disobedience.</HI> Here the Apostle gives their evil walking, and not any thing that is not reduced to act, as a Reason of their being <HI>Children of Wrath.</HI> And this is suitable to the whole strain of the Gospel, where no Man is ever threatened or judged for what Iniquity he hath not actually wrought; Such indeed as continue in Iniquity, and so do allow the Sins of their Fathers, God will visit the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Chil∣dren.</P>
<PB N="104" REF="003129_0059_0FF0047A43741FF0"/>
<P>Is it not strange then, that Man should entertain an Opinion so absurd in it self, and so cruel and contrary to the Nature, as well of God's Mercy, as Justice; concerning the which, the Scripture is altogether silent? But it is manifest, that Man hath invented this Opinion out of Self-Love, and from that bitter Root,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bso∣lute Decree of Election, springs from Self-Love.</NOTE> from which all Errors spring; for the most part of <HI>Protestants,</HI> that hold this, having (as they fancy) the <HI>Absolute Decree of Election</HI> to secure them and their Children, so as they can∣not miss of Salvation, they make no difficulty to send all others, both Old and young, to Hell. For whereas Self-love (which is always apt to believe that which it desires) possesseth them with a Hope, that their part is secure; they are not sollicitous how they leave their Neighbours, which are the far greater part of Mankind, in these Inextricable Dif∣ficulties. The <HI>Papists</HI> again use this Opinion, as an Art to augment the Esteem of their Church, and Reverence of its Sacraments; seeing they pretend, it is washed away by Baptism; only in this they appear to be a little more Merciful, in that they send not these Unbaptized <HI>Infants</HI> to Hell, but to a certain <HI>Limbus</HI>; concerning which the Scriptures are as silent, as of the other. This then is not only not Authorized in the Scripture, but contrary to the express Tenor of it. The Apostle saith plainly, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.15. <HI>Where no Law is, there is no Transgression:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">To Infants there is no Law, so no Transgres∣sion.</NOTE> And again, 5.13. <HI>But Sin is not im∣puted, where there is no Law.</HI> Than which Testimo∣nies, there is nothing more positive; since to Infants there is no Law, seeing as such, they are utterly uncapable of it; the Law cannot reach any but such as have, in some measure, less or more, the exercise of their Understanding, which Infants have not, So that from thence I thus argue:

<P><HI>Secondly</HI>; What can be more positive than that of <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.20. <HI>The Soul that sinneth, it shall die: The Son shall not bear the Father's Iniquity?</HI> For the Prophet here first sheweth, what is the Cause of Man's Eternal Death, which he saith, is his <HI>Sinning</HI>; and then, as if he purposed expresly to shut out such an Opinion, he assures us, <HI>The Son shall not bear the Father's Iniquity.</HI> From which I thus argue:</P>
<P><LIST TYPE="syllogism">
<ITEM>If the Son bear not the Iniquity of his Father,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infants bear not <HI>Adam's</HI> Transgres∣sion.</NOTE> or of his immediate Parents, far less shall he bear the Iniquity of <HI>Adam.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>But the Son shall not bear the Iniquity of his Father:</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Therefore,</HI> &amp;c.</ITEM></LIST></P>
<P N="5">§. V. Having thus far shewn how absurd this Opinion is, I shall briefly examine the Reasons its Authors bring for it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="1"/> First; They say, <HI>Adam was a publick Person, and therefore all Men sinned in him, as being in his Loins.</HI> And for this they alledge that of <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12. <HI>Where∣fore as by one Man sin entered into the World, and Death by sin; and so Death passed upon all Men, for that all have sinned,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>These last words,</HI> say they, <HI>may be translated, In whom all have sinned.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> To this I answer: That <HI>Adam</HI> is a publick Per∣son, is not denied; and that through him there is a Seed of Sin propagated to all Men, which in its own Nature is sinful, and inclines Men to Ini∣quity; yet will it not follow from thence, that
<PB N="106" REF="003129_0060_0FF0047CC1430F20"/>
Infants, who joyn not with this Seed, are guilty. As for these words in the <HI>Romans,</HI> the reason of the Guilt there alledged, is, <HI>For that all have sinned.</HI> Now no Man is said to sin, unless he actually sin in his own Person; for the Greek words <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> may very well relate to <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which is the nearest Antecedent; so that they hold forth, how that <HI>Adam,</HI> by his Sin, gave an entrance to Sin in the World: <HI>And so Death entered by sin,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> i. e. <HI>upon which</HI> (viz. Occasion) or, <HI>in which</HI> (viz. Death) <HI>all</HI> others <HI>have sinned,</HI> that is, Actually in their own Persons; to wit, all that were capable of sinning: Of which Number that Infants could not be, the Aposte clearly shews by the following verse, <HI>Sin is not imputed, where there is no Law:</HI> And since, as is above proved, there is no Law to Infants, they cannot be here included.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="2"/> Their Second Objection is from <HI>Psalm</HI> 51.5. <HI>Be∣hold, I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my mother conceive me. Hence,</HI> they say, <HI>it appears, that Infants from their Conception are guilty.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> How they infer this Consequence, for my part, I see not. The Iniquity and Sin here, appears to be far more ascribable to the Parents, than to the Child.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conceived in Sin, <HI>answered.</HI></NOTE> It is said indeed, <HI>In Sin did my Mother con∣ceive me</HI>; not, <HI>My Mother did conceive me a Sinner.</HI> Besides, that so interpreted, contradicts expresly the Scripture before-mentioned, in making Chil∣dren guilty of the Sins of their immediate Parents, (for of <HI>Adam</HI> there is not here any mention) con∣trary to the plain words, <HI>The Son shall not bear the Father's Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="3"/> Thirdly, They object, <HI>That the Wages of Sin is Death; and that seeing Children are subject to Diseases and Death, therefore they must be guilty of Sin.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer: That these things are a Consequence of the Fall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Death, the Wages of Sin, <HI>an∣swered.</HI></NOTE> and of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, is confessed; but that that infers necessarily a Guilt in all others, that are subject to them, is denied. For though
<PB N="107" REF="003129_0060_0FF0047CC1430F20"/>
the whole outward Creation suffered a decay by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, which groans under Vanity; accord∣ing to which it is said in <HI>Job,</HI> That <HI>the Heavens are not clean in the sight of God</HI>; yet will it not from thence follow, that the Herbs, Earth, and Trees, are Sinners.</P>
<P><HI>Next,</HI> Death, though a consequent of the Fall, incident to Man's Earthly Nature, is not the Wages of Sin in the Saints, but rather a Sleep, by which they pass from Death to Life; which is so far from being troublesome and painful to them, as all real Punishments for Sin are, that the Apostle counts it Gain: <HI>To me,</HI> saith he, <HI>to die is Gain,</HI> Phil. 1.21.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="4"/> Some are so foolish, as to make an Objection far∣ther, saying; <HI>That if</HI> Adam<HI>'s Sin be not imputed to those who actually have not sinned, then it would follow, that all Infants are saved.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> But we are willing, that this supposed Absurdity should be the consequence of our Doctrine; rather than that, which (it seems) our Adversaries reckon not Absurd; tho' the undoubted and unavoidable Consequence of theirs, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>many Infants eter∣nally perish; not for any sin of their own, but only for</HI> Adam<HI>'s Iniquity:</HI> Where we are willing to let the Controversie stop, commending both to the Illumi∣nated Understanding of the <HI>Christian Reader.</HI></P>
<P>This Error of our Adversaries, is both denied and refused by <HI>Zwinglius,</HI> that Eminent Founder of the <HI>Protestant Churches</HI> of <HI>Zwitzerland,</HI> in his Book <HI>De Baptismo</HI>; for which he is Anathematized by the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> in the <HI>fifth Session.</HI> We shall only add this Information: That we confess then, that a Seed of Sin is transmitted to all Men, from <HI>Adam,</HI> (altho' imputed to none, until by sinning they actu∣ally joyn with it) in which Seed he gave Occasion to all to Sin; and it is the Origin of all evil Acti∣ons and Thought in Men's Hearts, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> to wit, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as it is in <HI>Romans</HI> 5. i. e. <HI>In which Death all

have sinned.</HI> For this Seed of Sin is frequently cal∣led <HI>Death</HI> in the Scripture, and the <HI>Body of Death</HI>; seeing indeed it is a <HI>Death</HI> to the Life of Righte∣ousness and Holiness: Therefore its Seed, and its Product, is called the <HI>Old Man,</HI> the <HI>Old Adam,</HI> in which all Sin is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Original Sin no Scripture Phrase.</NOTE> for which cause we use this Name to express this Sin, and not that of <HI>Original Sin</HI>; of which Phrase the Scripture makes no mention, and under which invented and unscriptural Barbarism, this Notion of <HI>Imputed Sin to Infants,</HI> took place among Christians.</P>

<P>GOD, <HI>out of his Infinite Love,</HI> who delighteth not in the Death of a Sinner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek. 12.32. and 33.11.</NOTE> but that all should live and be saved, hath so loved the World, that he hath given his only Son a <HI>Light,</HI> that whoso∣ever believeth in him, shall be saved, <HI>John</HI> 3.16. Who inlightneth <HI>every</HI> Man that cometh into the World, <HI>John</HI> 1.9. And maketh manifest all things, that are reproveable, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5.13. <HI>And teacheth all Temperance, Righteousness, and Godliness. And this</HI> Light <HI>lightneth the Hearts of all, in a day, in order to Salvation; and this is it, which reproves the Sin of all Individuals, and would work out the Salvation of all, if not resisted. Nor is it less</HI> Universal, <HI>than the Seed of Sin, being the Pur∣chase of his Death,</HI> who tasted Death for every Man.

<HEAD>PROPOSITION VI.</HEAD>
<P>According to which Principle (or Hypothesis) all the Objections against the Universality of <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Death,</HI> are easily solved; neither is it needful to recur to the Ministry of Angels, &amp; those other Miraculous Means, which, they say, God useth, to manifest the Doctrine and History of <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Passion</HI> unto such, who (living in the places of the World, where the outward Preach∣ing of the Gospel is unknown) have well improved the first and common Grace. For as hence it well follows, that some of the Old <HI>Philosophers</HI> might have been saved; so also may some (who by Providence are cost into those Remote Parts of the World, where the Know∣ledge of the History is wanting) be made Partakers of the Divine Mystery, if they receive, and resist not that Grace, <HI>A Manifestation whereof is given to every Man to profit withal.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12.17</NOTE> This most certain Doctrine being then received, that there is an <HI>Evangelical</HI> and <HI>Saving Light and Grace in all,</HI> the Universality of the Love and Mercy of God towards Mankind (both in the Death of his Beloved Son, the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> and in the Manifestation of the <HI>Light</HI> in the Heart) is established and confirmed, against all the Objections of such as deny it. Therefore <HI>Christ hath tasted Death for every Man;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 2.9.</NOTE> not only for <HI>all kinds of Men,</HI> as some vainly talk; but for Every Man, of <HI>all kinds:</HI> The Benefit of whose Offering, is not only extended to such who have the distinct outward Knowledge of his <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Sufferings,</HI> as the same is declared in the Scriptures: but even unto those, who are necessarily excluded from the Benefit of this Know∣ledge, by some inevitable Accident. Which Knowledge we willingly confess to be very Profitable and Com∣fortable; but not absolutely Needful unto such, from whom God himself hath with-held it; yet they may be made Partakers of the Mystery of his Death (tho' ignorant of the History) if they suffer his <HI>Seed</HI> and <HI>Light (inlightning their Hearts)</HI> to take place,
<PB N="110" REF="003129_0062_0FF004800D885EE8"/>
(in which Light, communion with the Father and the Son is enjoyed) <HI>so as of wicked Men, to become holy; and Lovers of that Power, by whose inward and secret Touches, they feel themselves turned from the Evil to the Good, and learn</HI> to do to others, as they would be done by; <HI>in which Christ himself affirms all to be included. As</HI> They <HI>have then falsly and erroneously taught, who have denied Christ to have died for all Men; so neither have</HI> They <HI>suf∣ficiently taught the Truth, who affirming him to have died for all, have added the absolute necessity of the outward Knowledge thereof, in order to obtain its saving Effect. Among whom the</HI> Remonstrants <HI>of</HI> Holland <HI>have been chiefly wanting, and many other Assertors of</HI> Universal Redemption; <HI>in that they have not placed the Extent of his Salvation in that</HI> Divine <HI>and</HI> Evangelical Principle of Light and Life <HI>wherewith</HI> Christ hath inlightned every Man that cometh into the World; <HI>which is excellently and evidently held forth in these Scriptures,</HI> Gen. 6.3. Deut. 30.14. John 1.7, 8, 9, 16, Rom. 10.8. Titus 2.11.</P>
<P>HItherto we have considered Man's fallen, lost, corrupted and degenerated Condition.</P>
<P>Now it is fit to enquire, <HI>How and by what means he may come to be Freed out of this miserable and de∣praved Condition</HI>: Which in these two Propositions is declared and demonstrated; which I thought meet to place together, because of their Affinity; the one being, as it were, an Explanation of the other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Absolute Reproba∣tio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that horrible &amp; blasphe∣mous Do∣ctrine de∣scribed.</NOTE>As for that Doctrine, which these Propositions chiefly strike at, to wit, <HI>Absolute Reprobation</HI>: ac∣cording to which some are not afraid to assert,
<Q>That God, by an Eternal and Immutable Decree, hath Predestinated to <HI>Eternal Damnation</HI> the far greater part of Mankind, not considered as Made, much less as Fallen, without any respect to their
<PB N="111" REF="003129_0062_0FF004800D885EE8"/>
Disobedience or Sin; but only for the demonstra∣ting of the Glory of his Justice; and that for the bringing this about, he hath appointed these mi∣serable Souls necessarily to walk in their wicked Ways, that so his Justice may lay hold on them: And that God doth therefore not only suffer them, to be liable to this Misery in many parts of the World, by with-holding from them the Preaching of the Gospel, and Knowledge of Christ; but even in those places where the Gospel is preached, and Salvation by Christ is offered; whom, though he publickly invite them, yet he justly condemns for Disobedience, albeit he hath with-held from them all Grace, by which they could have laid hold on the Gospel, <HI>viz.</HI> Because he hath by a secret Will, unknown to all Men, ordained and decreed with∣out any respect had to their Disobedience or Sin) that they shall not obey, and that the offer of the Gospel shall never prove effectual for their Salva∣tion; but only serve to aggravate and occasion their greater Condemnation.</Q></P>
<P>I say, As to this Horrible and Blasphemous Do∣ctrine, our Cause is common with many others, who have both Wisely and Learnedly, according to Scripture, Reason, and Antiquity, refuted it: Seeing then that so much and so well, is said al∣ready against this Doctrine, that little can be super-added, except what hath been said already▪ I shall be short in this respect. Yet, because it lies so in Opposition to my way, I cannot let it alto∣gether pass.</P>
<P N="1">§. I. First;<NOTE PLACE="marg">This Do∣ctrine a Novelty.</NOTE> We may safely call this Doctrine a Novelty, seeing the first Four Hundred Years after Christ, there is no mention made of it: For as it is contrary to the Scripture's Testimony, and to the Tenor of the Gospel; so all the Ancient Wri∣ters, Teachers, and Doctors of the Church, pass it over with a profound Silence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rise of it.</NOTE> The first Foun∣dations of it were laid in the later Writings of
<PB N="112" REF="003129_0063_0FF00482A10838F8"/>
<HI>Augustin</HI>; who, in his Heat against <HI>Pelagius,</HI> let fall some expressions, which some have unhappily gleaned up, to the establishing of this Error; thereby contradicting the Truth, and sufficiently gain-saying many others, and many more and fre∣quent Expressions of the same <HI>Augustin.</HI> After∣wards was this Doctrine fomented by <HI>Dominicus</HI> a Friar, and the Monks of his Order; and at last unhappily taken up by <HI>John Calvin,</HI> (otherwise a Man in divers respects to be commended) to the great Staining of his Reputation, and Defamation both of the Protestant and Christian Religion: Which, tho' it received the Decrees of the Synod of <HI>Dort</HI> for its Confirmation, hath since lost ground, and begins to be exploded by most Men of Learn∣ing and Piety in all Protestant Churches. How∣ever we should not oppugn it for the Silence of the Ancients, Paucity of its Assertors, or for the Learnedness of its Opposers, if we did observe it to have any real bottom in the Writings or Say∣ings of Christ and the Apostles; and that it were not <HI>highly Injurious to God himself, to Jesus Christ our Mediator and Redeemer; and to the Power, Vertue, Nobility and Excellency of his Blessed Gospel; and last∣ly, unto all Mankind.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1.</HI> It's high∣ly injuri∣ous to God, in making him the Author of Sin.</NOTE>§. II. First; <HI>It is highly Injurious to God,</HI> because it makes him the Author of Sin; which of all things is most contrary to his Nature. I confess the Assertors of this Principle deny this Conse∣quence; but that is but a meer Illusion, seeing it so naturally follows from their Doctrine, and is equally Ridiculous, as if a Man should pertinaci∣ously deny, that <HI>One</HI> and <HI>Two</HI> makes <HI>Three.</HI> For if God has decreed that the Reprobated Ones shall perish, without all respect to their evil Deeds, but only of his own Pleasure; and if he hath also decreed, long before they were in Being, or in a Capacity to do Good or Evil, that they should walk in those wicked Ways, by which, as by a
<PB N="113" REF="003129_0063_0FF00482A10838F8"/>
secondary Means, they are led to that end: Who, I pray, is the first Author and Cause thereof, but God, who so willed and decreed? This is as na∣tural a Consequence as any can be: And therefore, altho' many of the Preachers of this Doctrine have sought out various, strange, strained and intricate Distinctions, to defend their Opinion, and evite this horrid Consequence; yet some, and that of the most Eminent of them, have been so plain in the matter, as they have put it beyond all doubt. Of which I shall instance a few among many Passages. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Calvin</HI> in cap. 3. <HI>Gen. Id.</HI> 1 Inst. c. 18.

<P>If these Savings do not plainly and evidently Import, that <HI>God is the Author of Sin,</HI> we must not then seek these Men's Opinions from their Words, but some way else: It seems as if they had assumed to themselves that monstrous and two-fold Will they feign of God; one by which they declare their Minds openly, and another more secret and hidden, which is quite contrary to the other. Nor doth it at all help them, to say, That Man Sins willingly; since their Willingness, Proclivity, and Propensity to Evil, is (according to their Judgment) so necessarily imposed upon them, that he cannot but be Willing, because God hath Willed and De∣creed him to be so. Which Shift is just as if I should take a Child uncapable to resist me, and throw it down from a great Precipice; the weight of the Child's Body indeed makes it go readily down, and the Violence of the Fall upon some Rock or Stone, beats out its Brains, and kills it. Now then, I pray, tho' the Body of the Child goes willingly down (for I suppose, as to its Mind, it is uncapable of any Will) and the weight of its Body, and not any immediate stroke of my hand, who perhaps am at a great distance, makes it dye; Whether is the Child, or I, the proper cause of its Deith? Let any Man of Reason judge, if God's part be not (with them) as great, yea more immediate, in the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns of Men (as by the Testimonies above brought doth appear) whether doth not this make him not only the Author of Sin, but more Unjust, then the unjustest of Men.</P>
<P N="3"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2.</HI> It makes God de∣light in the Death of a Sinner.</NOTE>§. III. Secondly; <HI>This Doctrine is Injurious to God,</HI> because it makes him delight in the Death of Sin∣ners; yea, and to will many to dy in their Sins, contrary to these Scriptures, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33 11. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.3, 4. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.9.

from them the Means of doing Good, but also Pre∣destinated the Evil, that they might fall into it; and that he Inclines and Forces them into great Sins; certainly he must necessarily delight in their Death, and will them to dy; seeing against his own Will he neither doth nor can do any good.</P>
<P N="4">§. IV. Thirdly;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>3.</HI> It rend∣ers Christ's Mediation ineffectual.</NOTE> <HI>It is highly Injurious to Christ our Mediator, and to the Efficacy and Excellency of his Gospel</HI>: For it renders his Mediation ineffectual, as if he had not by his Sufferings throughly bro∣ken down the <HI>middle Wall,</HI> nor yet removed the <HI>Wrath of God,</HI> nor purchased the <HI>Love of God</HI> to∣wards all Mankind; if it was afore-decreed, that it should be of no Service to the far greater part of Mankind. It is to no purpose to alledge, that the Death of Christ was of Efficacy enough to have saved all Mankind; if in effect its Vertue be not so far extended, as to put all Mankind into a Capacity of Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>4.</HI> It makes the Gospel a Mock.</NOTE> It makes the <HI>Preaching of the Gospel a meer Mock and Illusion,</HI> if many of these, to whom it is preached be by an irrevocable Decree, ex∣cluded from being benefitted by it: It wholly makes useless the Preaching of Faith and Re∣pentance, and the whole Tenor of the Gospel-Promises and Threatnings, as being all relative to a former Decree and Means before appointed to such: Which, because they cannot fail, M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> needs do nothing but wait for that Irresistible Juncture, which will come, tho' it be but at the last hour of his Life, if he be in the Decree of <HI>Election:</HI> And be his Diligence and Waiting what it can, he shall never Attain it, if he belong to the Decree of <HI>Reprobation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly</HI>; It makes the <HI>Coming of Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>5.</HI> It makes the Coming of Christ, an Act of Wrath.</NOTE> <HI>and his Propitiatory Sacrifice,</HI> which the Scripture affirms to have been the Fruit of God's Love to the World, and transacted for the Sins and Salvation of all Men, <HI>to have been rather a Testimony of God's Wrath
<PB N="116" REF="003129_0065_0FF00486F0D9D818"/>
to the World, and one of the greatest Judgments, and severest Acts of God's Indignation towards Mankind</HI>; it being only ordain'd to save a very few, and for the Hardening, and Augmenting the Condemnation of the far greater number of Men, because they be∣lieve not truly in it; the Cause of which Unbelief again (as the Divines [so called] above assert) is the hidden Counsel of God: Certainly the Com∣ing of Christ was never to them a Testimony of God's Love, but rather of his Implacable Wrath: And if the World may be taken for the far greater number of such as live in it, God never loved the World, according to this Doctrine, but rather hated it greatly, in sending his Son to be Crucified in it.</P>
<P N="5"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>6.</HI> It renders Mankind in a worse Condition than the Devils—</NOTE>§. V. Sixthly; <HI>This Doctrine is highly Injurious to Mankind</HI>; for it renders them in a far worse Con∣dition, than the Devils in Hell. For these were sometimes in a capacity to have stood, and do suffer only for their own Guilt; whereas many Millions of Men are for ever tormented, accord∣ing to them, for <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, which they neither knew of, nor ever were accessary to. It renders them worse than the Beasts of the Field, of whom the Master requires no more than he is able to perform; and if they be killed, Death to them is the end of Sorrow; whereas Man is for ever tor∣mented,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Than the <HI>Israelites</HI> under <HI>Pha∣raoh.</HI></NOTE> for not doing that which he never was able to do. It puts him into a far worse Condi∣tion than <HI>Pharaoh</HI> put the <HI>Israelites:</HI> For tho' he with-held Straw from them; yet by much Labour and Pains they could have gotten it: But from Men they make God to with-hold all means of Salvation, so that they can by no means attain it. Yea, they place Mankind in that condition, which the Poets seign of <HI>Tantalus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tantalus</HI> his Con∣dition.</NOTE> who oppressed with Thirst, stands in Water up to the Chin, yet can by no means reach it with his Tongue; and being tormented with Hunger, hath Fruit hanging at his
<PB N="117" REF="003129_0065_0FF00486F0D9D818"/>
very Lips, yet so as he can never lay hold on them with his Teeth; and these things are so near him, not to nourish him, but to torment him. So do these Men. They make the outward Creation of the Works of Providence, the Smitings of the Con∣science, sufficient to Convince the <HI>Heathens</HI> of Sin, and so to Condemn and Judge them; but not at all to help them to Salvation. They make the Preach∣ing of the Gospel, the offer of Salvation by Christ, the Use of the Sacraments, of Prayer and good Works, sufficient to Condemn those they account <HI>Reprobates</HI> within the Church; serving only to in∣form them, to beget a seeming Faith, and vain Hope; yet, because of a secret Impotency, which they had from their Infancy, all these are wholly ineffectual to bring them the least step towards Salvation; and do only contribute to render their Condemnation the greater, and their Torments the more violent and intolerable.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly Removed this false Doctrine, (which stood in my way) because they that are de∣sirous, may see it both Learnedly and Piously Re∣futed by many others; I come to the matter of our Proposition, which is; That <HI>God out of his infinite Love, who delighteth not in the Death of a Sinner, but that all should live and be saved, hath sent his only Be∣gotten Son into the World, that whosoever believeth in him, might be saved</HI>: Which also is again affirmed in the Sixth Proposition, in these words,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Christ</HI> tasted Death for every Man.</NOTE> <HI>Christ then tasted Death for every Man, of all kinds.</HI> Such is the Evidence of this Truth, delivered almost wholly in the express words of Scripture, that it will not need much Probation. Also, because our Assertion herein is common with many others, who have both Earnestly and Soundly, according to the Scripture, pleaded for this <HI>Universal Redemption</HI>; I shall be the more brief in it, that I may come to that, which may seem more singularly and peculiarly ours.</P>
<PB N="118" REF="003129_0066_0FF00489F0C532F0"/>
<P N="6"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ's Re∣demption Universal, contrary to the Doc∣rine of <HI>Absolute Reproba∣tion.</HI></NOTE>§. VI. This Doctrine of <HI>Universal Redemption,</HI> or <HI>Christ's dying for all Men,</HI> is of it self so evident from the Scripture-Testimony, that there is scarce found any other Article of the Christian Faith, so frequently, so plainly, and so positively Asserted. It is that, which maketh the Preaching of Christ to be truly termed the <HI>Gospel</HI> or an <HI>Annunciation of Glad-Tidings to all.</HI> Thus the Angel declared the Birth and Coming of Christ to the Shepherds to be, <HI>Luke</HI> 2.10. <HI>Behold, I bring you good Tidings of great Joy, which shall be to All People</HI>: He saith not, <HI>to a Few.</HI> Now if this Coming of Christ had not brought a Possibility of Salvation <HI>to all,</HI> it should rather have been accounted, Bad Tidings of great Sorrow to most People; neither should the Angel have had reason to have sung, <HI>Peace on Earth, and good Will towards Men,</HI> if the greatest part of Man∣kind had been necessarily shut out from receiving any benefit by it. How should Christ have sent cut His to <HI>Preach the Gospel to every Creature,</HI> Mark 16.15. (a very Comprehensive Commission) that is, <HI>to every Son and Daughter of Mankind,</HI> without all Exception? He commands them to preach <HI>Salvation to all, Repentance and Remission of Sins to all; Warning every one, and Exhorting every one,</HI> as <HI>Paul</HI> did <HI>Col.</HI> 1.28.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gospel is preached to <HI>every Man.</HI></NOTE> Now how could they have preached the Gospel <HI>to every Man,</HI> as became the Ministers of Jesus Christ, in much assurance, if Salvation by that Gospel had not been possible unto all? What! if some of those had asked them, or should now ask any of the Doctors, who deny the Universality of Christ's Death, and yet preached it to all promis∣cuously, <HI>Hath Christ died for me?</HI> How can they, with Confidence, give a certain Answer to this Question? If they give a Conditional Answer, as their Prin∣ciple obligeth them to do, and say, <HI>If thou Repent, Christ hath died for thee</HI>; doth nor the same Question still recur? <HI>Hath Christ died for me, so as to make Repentance possible to me</HI>? To this they can answer
<PB N="119" REF="003129_0066_0FF00489F0C532F0"/>
nothing; unless they run in a Circle. Whereas the <HI>Feet of those, that bring the glad Tidings of the Gospel of Peace,</HI> are said to be <HI>Beautiful</HI>; for that they preach the <HI>Common Salvation,</HI> Repentance unto All; offering a Door of Mercy and Hope to All, through <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> who <HI>gave himself a Ransom for All.</HI> The Gospel invites All: And certainly by the Gospel, <HI>Christ</HI> intended not to deceive and delude the greater part of Mankind, when he invites, and cryeth, saying; <HI>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</HI> If <HI>All</HI> then ought to seek after him, and to look for Salvation by him, he must needs have made Salvation <HI>possible</HI> to <HI>All:</HI> For who is bound to seek after that, which is impossible? Certainly it were a <HI>Mocking of Men,</HI> to bid them do so. And such as deny, that by the Death of Christ, <HI>Salvation</HI> is made <HI>possible to all Men,</HI> do most Blasphemously make God mock the World, in giving his Servants a Commission to <HI>Preach the Gospel of Salvation unto all,</HI> while he hath before de∣creed, that it shall not be Possible for them to re∣ceive it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Absur∣dity of that Doc∣trine of <HI>Absolute Reproba∣tion.</HI></NOTE> Would not this make the Lord to send forth his Servants with a <HI>Lye in their Mouth,</HI> (which were Blasphemous to think) commanding them, to bid <HI>All</HI> and <HI>Every One</HI> Believe, That Christ died for them, and had purchased Life and Salvation: Whereas it is no such thing, according to the fore∣mentioned Doctrine? But seeing Christ, after he arose, and perfected the Work of our Redemption, gave a Commission to preach Repentance, Remission of Sins, and Salvation to all; it is manifest, that he <HI>died for all.</HI> For He that hath Commissionated his Servants thus to Preach, is a God of Truth, and no Mocker of poor Mankind; neither doth he require of any Man, that which is simply impos∣sible for him to do: For that <HI>no Man is bound to do that which is impossible,</HI> is a Principle of Truth, ingraven in every Man's Mind. And seeing he is both a most Righteous and Merciful God, it
<PB N="120" REF="003129_0067_0FF0048B92E46918"/>
cannot at all stand either with his Justice or Mercy, to bid such Men <HI>Repent</HI> or <HI>Believe,</HI> to whom it is impossible.</P>
<P N="7">§. VII. Moreover, if we regard the Testimony of the Scripture in this matter; where there is not one Scripture, which I know of, that affirmeth, <HI>Christ not to die for All</HI>; there are divers, that posi∣tively and expresly assert, <HI>He did</HI>; as, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.1, 3,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To Pray for <HI>all;</HI> for Christ died for <HI>all</HI>—</NOTE> 4, 6. <HI>I exhort therefore, that first of all, Supplica∣tions, Prayers, Intercessions, and giving of Thanks, be made for all Men,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who will have all Men to be saved, and to come to the Knowledge of the Truth; who gave himself a Ransom for All, to be testified in due time.</HI> Except we will have the Apostle here to assert quite another thing than he intended, there can be nothing more plain to confirm what we have asserted. And this Scripture doth well an∣swer to that manner of Arguing, which we have hitherto used: For, first, the Apostle here recom∣mends them to <HI>Pray for all Men</HI>: And to obviate such an Objection, as if he had said with our Ad∣versaries, <HI>Christ prayed not for the World, neither wil∣leth be us to pray for all; because he willeth not that all should be saved, but hath ordained many to be damned, that he might shew forth his Justice to them</HI>; he ob∣viates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">—And will have <HI>all</HI> Men to be saved.</NOTE> I say, such an Objection, telling them, that <HI>it is good and acceptable in the sight of God, who will have all Men to be saved.</HI> I desire to know, what can be more expresly affirmed, or can any two Pro∣positions be stated in terms more contradictory, than these two; <HI>God willeth not some to be saved</HI>; and <HI>God willeth all Men to be saved,</HI> or <HI>God will have no Man perish.</HI> If we believe the last, as the Apostle hath affirmed, the first must be destroyed; seeing of Contradictory Propositions, the one being placed, the other is destroyed. Whence (to conclude) he gives us a Reason of his Willingness, that all Men should be saved, in these words, <HI>Who gave himself a

Ransom for all</HI>; as if he would have said, Since Christ Died for all, since he gave himself a Ransom for all, therefore he will have all Men to be saved. This Christ himself gives, as the Reason of God's Love to the World, in these words: <HI>John</HI> 3.16. <HI>God so loved the World, that he gave his Only Begotten Son, that</HI> whosoever <HI>believeth in him, should not perish, but have Everlasting Life</HI>; compared with 1 <HI>John</HI> 4.9.

Wnere∣as,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Ad∣versaries false Doc∣trine of a great part of Man∣kind being pre-ordain∣ed for Damnati∣on, refuted</NOTE> according to the Doctrine of our Adversaries, he rather came to condemn the World, and judge it; and not that it might he saved by him, or to save it. For if he never came to bring Salvation to the greater part of Mankind, but that his com∣ing, tho' it could never do them good, yet shall augment their Condemnation; from thence it ne∣cessarily follows, that he came not of Intention to Save, but to Judge and Condemn the greater part of the World, contrary to his own express Testimony; and as the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> in the words above-cited, doth assert Affirmatively, <HI>That God wil∣leth the</HI> Salvation <HI>of all</HI>; so doth the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> assert Negatively, <HI>That he willeth not the</HI> perishing <HI>of any,</HI> 2 Pet. 3.9. <HI>The Lord is not slack concerning his Promise, as some Men count slackness, but is long-suffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</HI> And this is Correspondent to that of the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> 33.11. <HI>As I live, saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his way and live.</HI> If it be safe to believe God, and trust in him, we must not think, that he intends to cheat us by all these Expressions through his Ser∣vants; but that he was in good earnest. <MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="2"/> And that this Will and Desire of his hath not taken effect, the blame is on our parts, (as shall be after spoken of) which could not be, if we never were in any capacity of Salvation, or that Christ had never

All those Actions, in effect, being but a meer Illusion, while he hath appointed what the Conclusion of all shall be.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="3"/> <HI>Thirdly</HI>; This Doctrine is abundantly confirmed by that of the Apostle, 1 <HI>John</HI> 2.1, 2. <HI>And if any Man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous. And he is the Propitiation for our Sins; and not ours only, but also for the Sins of the whole World.</HI> The way which our Adversaries take to evite this Testimony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adversa∣ries Com∣ment upon the Word, the <HI>Whole World.</HI></NOTE> is most foolish and ridiculous: <HI>The [World] here,</HI> say they, <HI>is the World of Believers:</HI> For this <HI>Commentary,</HI> we have nothing but their own Assertion; and so, while it manifestly destroys the Text, may be justly rejected. For, first, let them shew me, if they can, in all the Scripture, where the [<HI>whole World</HI>] is taken for <HI>Believers</HI> only; I shall shew them, where it is many times taken for the quite contrary; as, <HI>The World knows me not: The World receives me not: I am not of this World</HI>: Besides all these Scriptures, <HI>Psalm</HI> 17.14. <HI>Isai.</HI> 13.11. <HI>Mat.</HI> 18.7. <HI>John</HI> 7.7. &amp; 8.26. &amp; 12.19. &amp; 14.17. &amp; 15.18, 19. &amp; 17.14. &amp; 18.20.

Is not that the Sins of Believers? Was not he one of those Believers? And was not this an universal Epistle, written to all the Saints, that then were? So that according to these Men's Comment, there should be a very unnecessary and foolish Redundancy in the Apostle's words as if he had said, <HI>He is a Propitiation not only for the</HI> Sins of all Believers, <HI>but for the</HI> Sins of all Believers: Is not this to make the Apostle's words void of good Sense? Let them shew us, where-ever there is such a manner of speaking in all the Scripture; where any of the Pen-men first name the <HI>Believers</HI> in <HI>Concreto</HI> with themselves, and then contra-distinguish them from some other whole World Believers. That (<HI>whole World</HI>) if it be of Believers, must not be the World we live in. But we need no better Interpreter for the Apostle, than himself; who uses the very same Expression and Phrase in the same Epistle, <HI>chap.</HI> 5.16. saying <HI>We know that</HI> we are of God, <HI>and the</HI> whole World <HI>lieth in Wickedness</HI>: There cannot be found in all the Scrip∣ture, two places which run more parallel; seeing in both, the same Apostle, in the same Epistle, to the same Persons, contra-distinguisheth himself, and the Saints, to whom he writes, from the whole World; which, according to these Men's Commen∣tary, ought to be understood of <HI>Believers:</HI> As if <HI>John</HI> had said, <HI>We know particular Believers are of God; but the whole World of Believers lieth in Wickedness.</HI> What absurd wresting of Scripture were this? And yet it may be as well pleaded for, as the other; for they differ not at all. Seeing then that the Apostle <HI>John</HI> tells us plainly, That Christ not only died for him, and for the Saints, and Members of
<PB N="125" REF="003129_0069_0FF0048FB3D35198"/>
the Church of God, to whom he wrote; but for the <HI>whole World:</HI> Let us then hold it for a certain and undoubted Truth, notwithstanding the Cavils of such as oppose.</P>
<P>This might also be proved from many more Scripture-Testimonies, if it were at this season needful. All the <HI>Fathers,</HI> so called, and <HI>Doctors</HI> of the Church, for the first Four Centuries, preached this Doctrine; according to which they boldly held forth the Gospel of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hea∣thens invi∣ted to Sal∣vation; none pre∣destinated to Dam∣nation.</NOTE> and Efficacy of his Death; inviting and intreating the <HI>Heathens</HI> to come and be Partakers of the Benefits of it; shew∣ing them, how there was a Door open for them <HI>All</HI> to be saved, through Jesus Christ; not telling them, that God had Predestinated any of them to Damnation, or had made Salvation impossible to them, by with-holding Power and Grace, neces∣sary to believe, from them. But of many of their Sayings, which might be alledged, I shall only in∣stance a few.</P>

But so, that that which was done by the Example of one, for all, might, by a singular Mystery, be cele∣brated in every one.

But the cause of this doth evidently appear, in that the way and Method, by which the Vertue and Efficacy of his Death is communicated to all Men, hath not been rightly understood, or indeed hath been erroneously Affirmed.

<P><HI>Therefore,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Of this Argument the other Party deny the As∣sumption, saying; That <HI>they, who never heard of Christ, are not obliged to believe in him; and seeing the</HI> Remonstrants (as they are commonly called) <HI>do generally themselves acknowledge, that without the outward Knowledge of Christ, there is no Salvation</HI>; that gives the other Party yet a stronger Argu∣ment for their precise Decree of Reprobation.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Remon∣strants</HI> Opi∣nion strengthens the precise Decree of Reproba∣tion.</NOTE> <HI>For,</HI> say they, <HI>seeing we all see really, and in effect, that God hath with held from many Generations, and yet from many Nations, that Knowledge which is ab∣solutely needful to Salvation, and so hath rendered it simply impossible unto them; Why may he not as well with hold the Grace necessary to make a saving Appli∣cation of that Knowledge, where it is preached? For there is no ground to say, That this was Injustice in God, or Partiality, more than his leaving those others in utter Ignorance; the one being but a with-holding Grace to apprehend the Object of Faith; the other, a with-drawing the Object it self.</HI> For answer to this, they are forced to draw a Conclusion from their former <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> of Christ's dying for all, and God's Mercy and Justice, saying.

and Nature, and favours a little of <HI>Socinianism</HI> and <HI>Pelagianism,</HI> or at least of <HI>Semi-Pelagianism</HI>; so, since it is only built upon probable Conjectures, neither hath it evidence enough to convince any, strongly tainted with the other Doctrine; nor yet doth it make the Equity and wonderful Harmony of God's Mercy and Justice towards <HI>all,</HI> so manifest to the Understanding. So that I have often observed, that these Assertors of Universal Grace, did far more pithly and strongly overturn the false Do∣ctrine of their Adversaries, than they did establish and confirm the Truth and Certainty of their own. And tho' they have Proof, sufficient from the holy Scriptures to confirm the Universality of Christ's Death,<NOTE PLACE="marg">None by an irrevocable Decree, ex∣cluded from Sal∣vation.</NOTE> and that none are precisely, by any irre∣vocable Decree, excluded from Salvation; yet I find, when they are pressed, in the respects above mentioned, to shew how God hath so far equally extended the Capacity to partake of the Benefit of Christ's Death unto all, as to communicate unto them a sufficient way of so doing, they are some∣what in a strait, and are put more to give us their Conjectures, from the certainty of the former pre∣supposed Truth, to wit, (that because Christ hath certainly died for all, and God hath not rendred Salvation impossible to any, therefore there must be some way or other, by which they may be saved, which must be by improving some common Grace, or by gathering from the Works of Crea∣tion and Providence) than by really demonstrating, by convincing and spiritual Arguments, what that way is.</P>

the Darkness of the Night comes not upon the outward Creation at once, but by degrees, ac∣cording as the Sun declines in each Horizon; so neither did that full and clear Light and Know∣ledge of the glorious Dispensation of the Gospel of Christ, appear all at once; the work of the first Witnesses being more to testifie against, and dis∣cover the Abuses of the Apostacy, than to esta∣blish the Truth in Purity. He that comes to build a new City, must first remove the old Rubbish, before he can see to lay a new foundation; and he that comes to a House greatly Polluted, and full of Dirt, will first sweep away and remove the Filth, before he put up his own good and new Furniture. The dawning of the Day dispels the Darkness, and makes us see the things that are most Conspicuous; but the distinct discovering and discerning of things, so as to make a certain and perfect Observation, is reserved for the arising of the Sun, and its shining in full Brightness. And we can, from a certain Experience, boldly affirm, that the not waiting for this, but building among, yea, and with the <HI>Old Popish Rubbish</HI>; and setting up before a full Purgation, hath been to most Protestants, the foundation of many a Mistake, and an occasion of unspeakable Hurt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The more full Disco∣very of the Gospel re∣served to this our Age.</NOTE> Therefore the Lord God, who, as he seeth meet, doth communicate and make known to Man, the more full, evident, and perfect Knowledge of his Everlasting Truth, hath been pleased to reserve the more full Discovery of this Glorious and E∣vangelical Dispensation, to this our Age, albeit divers Testimonies have thereunto been born by some noted Men in several Ages, as shall here∣after appear.

N="II"/> Secondly; <HI>That for this end God hath communi∣cated and given unto every Man a Measure of the Light of his own Son,</HI> a Measure of Grace <HI>or a</HI> Mea∣sure of the Spirit;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Measure of Light in all.</NOTE> which the Scripture expresses by several Names; as sometimes of <HI>the</HI> Seed <HI>of the Kingdom,</HI> Mat. 13.18, 19. <HI>The</HI> Light <HI>that makes all things manifest,</HI> Eph. 5.13. <HI>The</HI> Word <HI>of God,</HI> Rom. 10.18. or <HI>Manifesitations of the</HI> Spirit, <HI>given to profit withal</HI> 1 Cor. 12.7. <HI>A</HI> Talent, Mat. 25.15. <HI>A</HI> little Leaven, Mat. 13.33. <HI>The</HI> Gospel <HI>preached in every Creature,</HI> Col. 1.23.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Prop." N="III"/> Thirdly; <HI>That God, in and by this Light and Seed, invites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">God's Sal∣vation wrought by the Light in all.</NOTE> <HI>calls, exhorts, and strives with every Man, in order to save him</HI>; which, as it is received, and not resisted, works the Salvation of <HI>All,</HI> even of those who are ignorant of the Death and Sufferings of Christ, and of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, both by bringing them
<PB N="133" REF="003129_0073_0FF00499001FEBE0"/>
to a sense of their own <HI>Misery,</HI> and to be sharers in the Sufferings of Christ inwardly, and by making them partakers of his Resurrection, in becoming Holy, Pure and Righteous, and recovered out of their Sins. By which also are saved they that have the knowledge of Christ outwardly, in that it opens their Understanding, rightly to use and apply the things delivered in the Scripture, and to receive the saying use of them: But <HI>that this may be resisted and rejected in both, in which then God is said to be resisted and pressed down, and Christ to be again Cru∣cified, and put to open Shame, in and among Men.</HI> And to those, as thus resist and refuse him, he becomes their Condemnation.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then; According to this Doctrine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conse∣quences, 1.</NOTE> <HI>the Mercy of God is excellently well exhibited,</HI> in that none are necessarily shut out from Salvation; and his Justice is demonstrated, in that he condemns none, but such, to whom he really made offer of Salvation; affording them the means sufficient thereunto.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>; This Doctrine, if well weighed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cons. 2.</NOTE> will be found to be the <HI>Foundation of Christianity, Sal∣vation and Assurance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cons. 3.</NOTE> It agrees and answers <HI>with the whole Tenor of the Gospel Promises and Threats, and with the Nature of the Ministry of Christ,</HI> according to which, the Gospel, Salvation, Repentance, is commanded to be preached to every Creature, without respect of Nations, Kindreds, Families or Tongues.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cons. 4.</NOTE> <HI>It magnifies and commends the Merits and Death of Christ,</HI> in that it not only accounts them sufficient to save all; but declares them to be brought so nigh unto all, as thereby to be put into the nearest capacity of Salvation.</P>
<P>Fifthly; <HI>It exalts above all, the Grace of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cons. 5.</NOTE> to which it attributeth all good, even the least and smallest Actions that are so; ascribing thereunto,
<PB N="134" REF="003129_0074_0FF0049B758A7390"/>
not only the first Beginnings and Motions of Good, but also the whole Conversion and Salvation of the Soul.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cons. 6.</NOTE>Sixthly; <HI>It contradicts, overturns, and enervates the false Doctrine of the</HI> Pelagians, Semi-Pelagians, Soci∣nians, <HI>and others,</HI> who exalt the Light of Nature, the Liberty of Man's Will; in that it wholly excludes the Natural Man from having any place or portion in his own Salvation, by any acting, moving or working of his own, until he be first quickned, raised up, and acted by God's Spirit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cons. 7.</NOTE>Seventhly; <HI>As it makes the whole</HI> Salvation <HI>of Man solely, and alone, to depend upon God; so it makes his</HI> Condemnation <HI>wholly, and in every respect, to be of him∣self</HI>; in that he refused, and resisted somewhat, that from God wrestled and strove in his Heart; and forces him to acknowledge God's just Judgment, in rejecting and forsaking of him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cons. 8.</NOTE>Eighthly; <HI>It takes away all ground of Despair</HI>; in that it gives every one cause of Hope, and certain Assurance, that they may be saved: <HI>Neither doth feed any in Security,</HI> in that none are certain, how soon their Day may expire: And therefore it is a constant Incitement and Provocation, and lively Incouragement to every Man, to forsake Evil, and close with that which is Good.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cons. 9.</NOTE>Ninthly; <HI>It wonderfully commends as well the Cer∣tainty of the Christian Religion among</HI> Infidels, <HI>as it manifests its own Verity to all</HI>; in that it's confirmed and established by the Experience of all Men: See∣ing there was never yet a Man found, in any place of the Earth, however Barbarous and Wild, but hath acknowledged, that at some time or other, less or more, he hath found <HI>somewhat</HI> in his Heart, reproving him for some things Evil, which he hath done; threatning a certain H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, if he continued in them; as also promising and communicating a certain Peace and Sweetness, as he hath given way to it, and not resisted it.</P>
<PB N="135" REF="003129_0074_0FF0049B758A7390"/>
<P>Tenthly;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cons. 10.</NOTE> <HI>It wonderfully sheweth the excellent Wisdom of God,</HI> by which he hath made the Means of Sal∣vation so Universal and Comprehensive, that it is not needful to recur to those miraculous and strange Ways; seeing, according to this most true Doctrine, the Gospel reacheth All, of whatsoever Condition, Age, or Nation.</P>
<P>Eleventhly; <HI>It is really and effectually,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cons. 11.</NOTE> tho' not in so many Words, yet by Deeds, <HI>established and con∣firmed by all the Preachers, Promulgators, and Doctors of the</HI> Christian Religion, <HI>that ever were, or now are, even by those that otherways in their Judgment oppose this Doctrine</HI>; in that they all, whatever they have been, or are, or whatsoever People, Place or Coun∣try they come to, do preach to the People, and to every Individual among them, that they may be saved; intreating and desiring them to believe in Christ, who hath died for them. So that, what they deny in the general, they acknowledge of every particular; there being no Man to whom they do not preach, in order to Salvation; telling him, <HI>Jesus Christ calls, and wills him to believe and be saved</HI>; and that if he refuse, he shall therefore be condemned, and that his Condemnation is of himself. Such is the Evidence and Virtue of Truth, that it constrains its Adversaries, even against their wills, to plead for it.</P>
<P>Lastly; According to this Doctrine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cons. 12.</NOTE> the former Argument used by the <HI>Arminians,</HI> and evited by the <HI>Calvinists,</HI> concerning every Man's being bound to believe, that <HI>Christ died for him,</HI> is, by altering the Assumption, <HI>render'd Invincible,</HI> thus;</P>
<P><HI>That which every Man is bound to believe, is true:</HI></P>
<P><HI>But every Man is bound to believe, that God is mer∣ciful unto him:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Therefore,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Assumption no Man can deny, seing <HI>His Mercies</HI> are said to be <HI>over all his Works.</HI> And herein the Scripture every way declares the <HI>Mercy
<PB N="136" REF="003129_0075_0FF0049D17963928"/>
of God</HI> to be, in that he invites and calls Sinners to Repentance, and hath opened a Way of Salva∣tion for them: So that, though those Men be not bound to believe the <HI>History of Christ's Death and Passion,</HI> who never came to know of it; yet they are bound to believe, that God will be merciful to them, if they follow his ways; and that he is merciful unto them, in that he reproves them for Evil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Ad∣versaries unmerciful Assertion of God.</NOTE> and incourages them to Good. Neither ought any Man to believe, that God is unmerciful to him, or that he hath from the beginning ordained him to come into the World, that he might be left to his own Evil Inclinations, and so do wickedly, as a Means appointed by God, to bring him to Eternal Damnation; which, were it true, as our Adversaries affirm it to be of many Thousands, I see no reason why a Man might not believe it; for certainly a Man may believe the Truth.</P>
<P>As it manifestly appears, from the thing it self, that these good and excellent Consequences follow, from the Belief of this Doctrine; so from the Pro∣bation of them, it will yet more evidently appear. To which, before I come, it is requisite to speak somewhat concerning the State of the Controversie, which will bring great Light to the matter. For, from the not right understanding of a matter under debate, sometimes both Arguments on the one hand, and Objections on the other, are brought, which do no way hit the Case; and hereby also our Sense and Judgment therein will be more fully understood and opened.</P>
<P N="7"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Qu. 1.</NOTE>§. XII. First then; By this <HI>Day and Time of Vi∣sitation,</HI> which we say God gives unto all, during which they may be saved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Stat∣ing of the Question.</NOTE> <HI>we do not understand the whole time of every Man's Life</HI>; tho' to some it may be extended even to the very Hour of Death, as we see in the example of the Thief converted upon the Cross: But, <HI>such a</HI> Season, <HI>at least, as sufficiently exonerateth God of every Man's Condemnation,</HI> which
<PB N="137" REF="003129_0075_0FF0049D17963928"/>
to some may be sooner, and to others later, ac∣cording as the Lord in his Wisdom sees meet. So that many Men may out-live this Day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That many may out∣live the Day of God's Visi∣tation.</NOTE> after which there may be no possibility of Salvation to them, and God justly suffers them to be hardened, as a just Punishment of their Unbelief, and even raises them up, as Instruments of Wrath, and makes them a Scourge one against another. Whence, to Men in this Condition, may be fitly applied those Scriptures, which are abused to prove, <HI>That God incites Men necessarily to sin:</HI> This is notably ex∣press'd by the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. from verse 17, to the end; but especially verse 28. <HI>And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a Reprobate Mind, to do those things which are not convenient.</HI> That many may out-live this Day of God's <HI>Gracious Visitation</HI> unto them, is shewn by the Example of <HI>Esau, Heb.</HI> 12.16.17. who <HI>sold his Birth-right</HI>; so he had it once, and was capable to have kept it; but afterwards, when he would have inherited the Blessing, he was rejected. This appears also by Christ's weeping over <HI>Jerusalem, Luke</HI> 19.42. saying, <HI>If thou hadst known in this thy day, the things that belong unto thy Peace; but now they are hid from thine Eyes</HI>: Which plainly imports, a time when they might have known them, which now was removed from them, tho' they were yet alive; but of this more shall be said hereafter.</P>
<P N="13">§. XIII. Secondly; <HI>By this</HI> Seed, Grace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Qu. 2.</NOTE> <HI>and</HI> Word of God, <HI>and</HI> Light, <HI>wherewith</HI> we say, <HI>every one is enlightned,</HI> and hath a measure of it, which strives with him, in order to save him; and which may, by the stubbornness and wickedness of Man's will, be quenched, bruised, wounded, pressed down, slain and crucified, <HI>we understand not the proper</HI> Essence <HI>and</HI> Nature of God, <HI>precisely taken; which is not di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isible into Parts and Measures</HI> as being a <HI>most pure, simple Being, void of all Composition or Division,</HI> and therefore can neither be resisted, hurt, wounded, crucified,
<PB N="138" REF="003129_0076_0FF004A05ED616B8"/>
or slain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Light,</HI> what it is, and its Pro∣perties de∣scribed.</NOTE> by all the Efforts and Strength of Men: <HI>But we understand a Spiritual, Heavenly, and Invisible Principle, in which God, as Father, Son and Spirit, dwells</HI>; a measure of which Divine and Glorious Life is <HI>in all Men,</HI> as a <HI>Seed,</HI> which of its own Na∣ture draws, invites, and inclines to God; and this some call <HI>Vehiculum Dei,</HI> or the <HI>Spiritual Body of Christ, the Flesh and Blood of Christ, which came down from Heaven</HI>; of which all the Saints do feed, and are thereby nourished unto Eternal Life. And as every unrighteous Action is witnessed against, and reproved by this <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Seed</HI>; so by such Actions it is hurt, wounded and slain, and flees from them, even as the Flesh of Men flees from that which is of a contrary Nature to it. Now, because it is never separated from God nor Christ, but where∣ever it is, God and Christ are as wrapped up there∣in: Therefore, and in that respect, as it is resisted, God is said to be resisted; and where it is born down, God is said to be pressed, <HI>as a Cart under Sheaves</HI>; and Christ is said to be slain and crucified. And on the contrary, as this Seed is received in the Heart, and suffered to bring forth its natural and proper Effect, Christ comes to be formed and raised, of which the Scripture makes so much mention, calling it, <HI>The New Man, Christ within, the Hope of Glory.</HI> This is that <HI>Christ within,</HI> which we are heard so much to speak and declare of, every where Preaching Him up, and Exhorting People to believe in the <HI>Light,</HI> and obey it, that they may come to know <HI>Christ in them,</HI> to deliver them from all Sin.</P>
<P>But by this, as we do not at all intend to <HI>equal our selves</HI> to that Holy Man, the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> who was born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> in whom all the Fulness of the God-head dwells Bodily;<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Fulness of the God-head dwells in Christ bodily, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> so nei∣ther do we <HI>destroy the Reality of his present Existence,</HI> as some have falsly Calumniated us. For, though we affirm, that Christ dwells in us, yet not im∣mediately,
<PB N="139" REF="003129_0076_0FF004A05ED616B8"/>
but mediately, as he is in that <HI>Seed,</HI> which is <HI>in us</HI>; whereas he, to wit, the <HI>Eternal Word,</HI> which was with God, and was God, dwelt immediately in that Holy Man. He then is as the Head, and we as the Members; he the Vine, and we the Branches. Now, as the Soul of Man dwells otherwise, and in a far more immediate manner, in the Head and in the Heart, than in the Hands or Legs; and as the Sap, Virtue, and Life of the Vine lodgeth far otherwise in the Stock and Root, than in the Branches; so God dwelleth otherwise in the Man <HI>Jesus,</HI> than in us. We also freely reject the Heresie of <HI>Apollinarius,</HI> who deny'd him to have any Soul, but said, The Body was only acted by the God-head: As also the Error of <HI>Eutyches,</HI> who made the Manhood to be wholly swallowed up of the God-head. Wherefore, as we believe he was a true and real Man; so we also believe, that he continues so to be Glorified in the Heavens, in Soul and Body, by whom God shall Judge the World, in the great and general Day of Judgment.</P>
<P N="14">§. XIV. Thirdly, <HI>We understand not this</HI> Seed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Qu. 3.</NOTE> Light <HI>or</HI> Grace, <HI>to be an Accident, as most Men ignorantly do, but a real Spiritual Substance,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Light is a Spiritual Substance, which may be felt in the Soul, and appre∣hended.</NOTE> which the Soul of Man is capable to feel and apprehend; from which that real, spiritual, inward Birth in Believers raises, called <HI>the New Creature, the New Man in the Heart.</HI> This seems strange to Carnal-minded Men, because they are not acquainted with it; but we know it, and are sensible of it, by a true and certain Experience; tho' it be hard for Man in his natu∣ral Wisdom to comprehend it, until he come to feel it in himself; and if he should, holding it in the meer Notion, it would avail him little. Yet we are able to make it appear to be true, and that our Faith concerning it, is not without a solid Ground: For it is in and by this Inward and Sub∣stantial Seed in our Hearts, as it comes to receive Nourishment, and to have a Birth or Geniture <HI>in</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="003129_0077_0FF004A20E85B660"/>
us, that we come to have those Spiritual Senses raised, by which we are made capable of <HI>tasting, smelling, seeing</HI> and <HI>handling</HI> the things of God: For a Man cannot reach unto those things by his natural spirit and senses, as is above declared.</P>
<P><HI>Next</HI>; We know it to be a <HI>Substance,</HI> because it subsists <HI>in</HI> the Hearts of wicked Men, even while they are in their Wickedness, as shall be hereafter proved more at large. Now no <HI>Accident</HI> can be in a <HI>Subject,</HI> without it give the Subject its own Deno∣mination; as where <HI>Whiteness</HI> is in a Subject, there the Subject is called <HI>White.</HI> So we distinguish be∣twixt <HI>Holiness,</HI> as it is an <HI>Accident,</HI> which denomi∣nates Man so,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Degrees of its Ope∣ration in the Soul of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> as the Seed receives a place <HI>in him</HI>; and betwixt this <HI>Holy, Substantial Seed,</HI> which many times lies <HI>in Man's Heart,</HI> as a naked Grain in the Stony Ground. So also, as we may distinguish be∣twixt <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Medicine; Health</HI> cannot be in a Body, without the Body be called <HI>Healthful,</HI> because <HI>Health</HI> is an Accident; but <HI>Medicine</HI> may be in a Body that is most Unhealthful, for that it is a Sub∣stance. And, as when a <HI>Medicine</HI> begins to work, the Body may in some respect be called <HI>healthful,</HI> and in some respect <HI>unhealthful</HI>; so we acknowledge, as this <HI>Divine Medicine</HI> receives place <HI>in Man's Heart,</HI> it may denominate him in some part <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Good</HI>; tho' there remain yet a corrupted, unmortified part, or some part of the Evil Humours unpurged out; for where two contrary Accidents are in one Sub∣ject, as <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Sickness</HI> in a Body, the Subject receives its Denomination from the Accident which prevails most. So many Men are called <HI>Saints,</HI> good and holy Men, and that truly, when this Ho∣ly Seed hath wrought <HI>in them,</HI> in a good measure, and hath somewhat leavened them into its Nature, tho' they may be yet liable to many Infirmities and Weaknesses, yea, and to some Iniquities. For, as the Seed of Sin, and Ground of Corruption, yea, and the Capacity of yielding thereunto, and some∣times
<PB N="141" REF="003129_0077_0FF004A20E85B660"/>
actually falling, doth not denominate a good and holy Man <HI>impious</HI>; so neither doth the Seed of Righteousness in Evil Men, and the possibility of their becoming one with it, denominate them <HI>good</HI> or <HI>holy.</HI></P>
<P N="15">§. XV. Fourthly;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Qu. 4.</NOTE> <HI>We do not hereby intend any ways to lessen or derogate from the</HI> Atonement <HI>and</HI> Sacrifice <HI>of Jesus Christ</HI>; but on the contrary, do magnifie and exalt it. For, as we believe all those things to have been certainly transacted, which are recorded in the Holy Scriptures, concerning the <HI>Birth, Life, Mira∣cles, Sufferings, Resurrection and Ascension of Christ</HI>; so we do also believe, that it is the Duty of every one to believe it, to whom it pleases God to reveal the fame, and to bring to them the Knowledge of it; yea, we believe it were <HI>Damnable Unbelief</HI> not to believe it, when so declared, but to resist that Holy Seed, which, if minded, would lead and incline every one to believe it, as it is offered unto them; tho' it revealeth not in every one the outward and explicit Knowledge of it, nevertheless it always assenteth to it, <HI>ubi declaratur,</HI> where it is declared. Nevertheless, as we firmly believe it was necessary, that Christ should come, that by his Death and Suf∣ferings he might offer up himself a Sacrifice to God for our Sins, who his own self <HI>bare our Sins in his own Body on the Tree</HI>; so we believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That Re∣mission of Sins is only and alone by Christ.</NOTE> that the Re∣mission of Sins, which any partake of, is only in and by Vertue of that most Satisfactory Sacrifice, and no otherwise. For it is <HI>by the Obedience of that One, that the Free gift is come upon All to Justification.</HI> For we affirm, That as all Men partake of the Fruit of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall; in that, by reason of that Evil Seed, which through him is communicated unto them, they are prone and inclined unto Evil, tho' Thousands of Thousands be ignorant of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, neither ever knew of the Eating of the Forbidden Fruit; so also many may come to feel the Influence of this Holy and Divine <HI>Seed</HI> and <HI>Light,</HI> and be turned
<PB N="142" REF="003129_0078_0FF004A53940B530"/>
from Evil to Good by it, tho' they knew nothing of Chist's coming in the Flesh, through whose Obedience and Sufferings it is purchased unto them. And as we affirm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The History is profita∣ble with the My∣stery.</NOTE> it is absolutely needful, that those do believe the History of Christ's outward Appearance, whom it pleased God to bring to the Knowledge of it; so we do freely confess, that even that outward Knowledge is very comfortable to such as are subject to it, and led by the inward <HI>Seed</HI> and <HI>Light.</HI> For, not only doth the sense of Christ's Love and Sufferings tend to humble them, but they are thereby also strengthened in their Faith, and incouraged to follow that Excellent Pattern, which he hath left us, <HI>who suffered for us,</HI> as saith the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.21. <HI>Leaving us an Example, that we should follow his steps</HI>: And many times, we are greatly edified and refreshed with the Gracious Sayings which proceed out of his Mouth. The <HI>History</HI> then is profitable and comfortable with the <HI>Mystery,</HI> and never without it; but the <HI>Mystery</HI> is and may be profitable, without the explicit and outward knowledge of the <HI>History.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Qu. 5.</NOTE>But <HI>Fifthly</HI>; This brings us to another Question, to wit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Christ is in all Men.</NOTE> <HI>Whether Christ be in all Men, or no?</HI> Which sometimes hath been asked us, and Arguments brought against it; because indeed it is to be found in some of our Writings that <HI>Christ is in all Men</HI>; and we often are heard, in our publick <HI>Meetings</HI> and <HI>Declarations,</HI> to desire every Man to know and be acquainted with <HI>Christ in them</HI>; telling them, that <HI>Christ is in them.</HI> It is fit therefore, for it moving of all Mistakes, to say something in this place concerning this matter. We have said be∣fore, how that a <HI>Divine, Spiritual and Supernatural Light is in all Men</HI>; how that <HI>that Divine Superna∣tural Light or Seed is</HI> Vehiculum Dei; how that <HI>God and Christ dwelleth in it, and is never separated from it</HI>; also how that <HI>(as it is received and closed with in the Heart) Christ comes to be formed and brought
<PB N="143" REF="003129_0078_0FF004A53940B530"/>
forth</HI>: But we are far from ever having said, <HI>That Christ is thus formed in all Men,</HI> or <HI>in the Wicked:</HI> For that is a great Attainment; which the Apostle travelled, that it might be brought forth in the <HI>Galatians.</HI> Neither is <HI>Christ in all Men</HI> by way of <HI>Union,</HI> or indeed, to speak strictly, by way of <HI>In∣habitation</HI>; because this <HI>Inhabitation,</HI> as it is gene∣rally taken, imports <HI>Union,</HI> or <HI>the manner of Christ's being in the Saints:</HI> As it is written, <HI>I will dwell in them, and walk in them,</HI> 2 Cor. 6.16. But in regard <HI>Christ is in all Men,</HI> as in a Seed, yea, and that he never is, nor can be, separate from that holy, pure Seed <HI>and</HI> Light, which is <HI>in All Men</HI>; therefore may it be said in a larger Sense, that he is <HI>in All,</HI> even as we observed before. The Scripture saith, <HI>Amos</HI> 2.13. God <HI>is pressed down as a Cart under Sheaves</HI>; and <HI>Christ crucified in the Ungodly</HI>: Tho' to speak pro∣perly and strictly, neither can God be <HI>pressed down,</HI> nor Christ, as God, be <HI>crucified.</HI> In this respect then, as he is <HI>in the Seed,</HI> which is <HI>in All Men,</HI> we have said, <HI>Christ is in All Men,</HI> and have preached and directed All Men to <HI>Christ in them</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ crucified in Man by Iniquities.</NOTE> who lies crucified in them, by their Sins and Iniquities; that they may <HI>look upon him, whom they have pierced,</HI> and repent: Whereby He, that now lies as it were slain and buried <HI>in them,</HI> may come to be raised, and have dominion in their Hearts over all. And thus also the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> preached to the <HI>Corin∣thians</HI> and <HI>Galatians,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.2. <HI>Christ crucified in them,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as the Greek hath it: This <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> was that which the Apostle desired to know <HI>in them,</HI> and make known <HI>unto them,</HI> that they might come to be sensible, how they had thus been <HI>Crucifying Christ</HI>; that so they might Repent and be Saved. And forasmuch as Christ is called that <HI>Light, that enlightens every Man, The Light of the World</HI>; there∣fore the <HI>Light</HI> is taken for <HI>Christ,</HI> who truly is the Fountain of <HI>Light,</HI> and hath his Habitation in it for ever. Thus the <HI>Light of Christ</HI> is sometimes
<PB N="144" REF="003129_0079_0FF004A715B649E0"/>
called <HI>Christ,</HI> i. e. that in which Christ is, and from which he is never separated.</P>
<P N="16">§. XVI. <HI>Sixthly</HI>; It will manifestly appear, by what is above-said, that <HI>we understand not this Di∣vine Principle to be any part of Man's Nature, nor yet to be any Reliques of any good, which</HI> Adam <HI>lost by his Fall</HI>; in that we make it a distinct separate thing from Man's Soul, and all the Faculties of it: Yet such is the <HI>Malice</HI> of our Adversaries, that they cease not sometimes to Calumniate us, as if we preached up a Natural Light, or the Light of Man's Natural Conscience. Next, There are that lean to the Doctrine of <HI>Socinus</HI> and <HI>Pelagius,</HI> who perswade themselves, through mistake, and out of no ill design to Injure us, as if this which we Preach up, were some Natural Power and Fa∣culty of the Soul, and that we only differ in the wording of it, and not in the thing it self: Where∣as there can be no greater difference, than is be∣twixt us in that matter: For we certainly know, that this <HI>Light,</HI> of which we speak, is not only distinct, but of a different Nature from the Soul of Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Facul∣ties of Mans Rea∣son.</NOTE> and its Faculties. Indeed that Man, as he is a Rational Creature, hath Reason as a natural Faculty of his Soul, by which he can discern things that are Rational, we deny not; for this is a property natural and essential to him, by which he can know and learn many Arts and Sciences, beyond what any other Animal can do, by the meer Animal Principle. Neither do we deny, but by this Rational Principle, Man may apprehend in his Brain, and in the Notion, a Knowledge of God, and Spiritual Things: Yet, that not being the right Organ, as in the Second Proposition hath more at length been signified, it cannot profit him towards Salvation; but rather hindreth; and in∣deed the great cause of the Apostacy hath been, that Man hath sought to fathom the things of God, in and by this Natural and Rational Principle,
<PB N="145" REF="003129_0079_0FF004A715B649E0"/>
and to build up a Religion in it, neglecting and over-looking this Principle and Seed of God in the Heart; so that herein, in the most Universal and Catholick Sense, hath <HI>Antichrist in every man set up himself, and sitteth in the</HI> Temple of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antichrist in the Tem∣ple of God.</NOTE> <HI>as</HI> God, <HI>and above every thing that is called</HI> God. For, <HI>men being the Temple of the Holy Ghost,</HI> as saith the Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.16. when the Rational Princi∣ple sets it self up there above the Seed of God, to reign and rule as a Prince in Spiritual Things, while the Holy Seed is wounded and bruised; there is <HI>Antichrist in every man,</HI> or somewhat ex∣alted above and against Christ. Nevertheless, we do not hereby affirm, as if Man had received his Reason to no purpose, or to be of no service unto him, in no wise: We look upon Reason as fit to order and rule Man in things Natural.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Divine Light, and Natural Reason di∣stinguished.</NOTE> For as God gave two great Lights to rule the out∣ward World, the Sun and Moon; the greater Light to rule the Day, and the lesser Light to rule the Night: So hath he given Man the Light of his Son, a Spiritual Divine Light, to rule him in things Spiritual; and the Light of Reason to rule him in things Natural. And even as the Moon borrows her Light from the Sun, so ought Men (if they would be rightly and comfortably ordered in Natural Things) to have their Reason inlightned by this Divine and Pure Light. Which inlightned Reason in those that obey and follow this true Light, we confess may be useful to Man, even in Spiritual Things, as it is still subservient, and subject to the other; even as the Animal Life in Man, regulated and ordered by his Reason, helps him in going about things that are Rational. We do further rightly distinguish this from Mans Na∣tural Conscience;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Light <HI>distin∣guished</HI> from Man's natural Conscience.</NOTE> for Conscience being that in Man, which ariseth from the Natural Faculties of Man's Soul, may be defiled and corrupted: It is said expresly of the Impute, <HI>Titus</HI> 1.15. <HI>That even
<PB N="146" REF="003129_0080_0FF004A8F9C759F0"/>
their Mind and Conscience is defiled.</HI> But this Light can never be corrupted nor defiled; neither did it ever consent to Evil or Wickedness in any; for it is said expresly, that <HI>it makes all things manifest that are reprovable,</HI> Eph. 5.13. And so is a faithful Wit∣ness for God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conscience <HI>defined.</HI></NOTE> against every Unrighteousness <HI>in Man.</HI> Now <HI>Conscience,</HI> to define it truly, comes from <HI>(Conscire)</HI> and <HI>is that Knowledge, which ariseth in Man's Heart, from what agreeth, contradicteth, or is con∣trary to any thing believed by him; whereby he becomes Conscious to himself, that he transgresseth, by doing that which he is perswaded, he ought not to do.</HI> So that the Mind being once blinded, or defiled with a wrong Belief, there raiseth a Conscience from that Belief, which troubles him, when he goes against it. As for Example:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Example of a <HI>Turk.</HI></NOTE> A <HI>Turk</HI> who hath possessed himself with a false Belief, that it is unlawful for him to drink Wine; if he do it, his Conscience smites him for it: But tho' he keep many Concubines, his Conscience troubles him not; because his Judg∣ment is already defiled with a false Opinion, that it is lawful for him to do the one, and unlawful to do the other. Whereas if the Light of Christ in him were minded, it would reprove him, not only for committing Fornication; but also, as he be∣came obedient thereunto, inform him that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was an <HI>Impostor</HI>; as well as <HI>Socrates</HI> was informed by it, in his day, of the Falsity of the Heathen's Gods.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Example of a <HI>Papist</HI></NOTE>So, if a <HI>Papist</HI> eat Flesh in <HI>Lent,</HI> or be not dili∣gent enough in Adoration of Saints and Images, or if he should Condemn Images, his Conscience would smite him for it; because his Judgment is already blinded with a false Belief concerning these things: Whereas the Light of Christ never consented to any of those Abominations. Thus then Man's Na∣tural Conscience is sufficiently distinguished from it; for Conscience followeth the Judgment, doth not inform it; but this Light, as it is received,
<PB N="147" REF="003129_0080_0FF004A8F9C759F0"/>
removes the Blindness of the Judgment, opens the Understanding, and rectifies both the Judgment and Conscience. So we confess also, that Con∣science is an excellent thing, where it is rightly informed and inlightned: Wherefore some of us have fitly compared it to the Lanthorn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Na∣tural Con∣science Compared to a <HI>Lan∣thorn,</HI> and the Light of Christ the <HI>Candle.</HI></NOTE> and the Light of Christ to a Candle: A Lanthorn is use∣ful, when a clear Candle burns and shines in it; but otherwise of no use. To the Light of Christ then, in the Conscience, and not to Man's Natu∣ral Conscience, it is, that we continually commend Men; this, not that, is it which we preach up, and direct People to, as to a most certain Guide unto Life Eternal.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> This <HI>Light, Seed,</HI> &amp;c. appears to be no Power or Natural Faculty of Man's Mind; because a Man that's in his Health, can, when he pleases, stir up, move and exercise the Faculties of his Soul; he is absolute Master of them; and except there be some natural Cause or Impediment in the way, he can use them at his pleasure: But this <HI>Light and Seed of God in Man,</HI> he cannot move and stir up when he pleaseth; but it moves, blows, and strives with Man, as the Lord seeth meet. For, tho' there be a Possibility of Salvation to every Man, during the Day of his Visitation; yet cannot a Man, at any time, when he pleaseth, or hath some sense of his <HI>Misery,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wait∣ing upon the Mo∣vings of the Light and Grace.</NOTE> stir up that Light and Grace, so as to procure to himself ten∣derness of Heart; but he must wait for it: Which comes upon all, at certain times and seasons, wherein it works powerfully upon the Soul, mightily tenders it, and breaks it; at which time, if Man resist it not, but closes with it, he comes to know Salvation by it. Even as the Lake of <HI>Bethesda</HI> did not Cure all those, that washed in it; but such only, as washed first, after the Angel had moved upon the Waters; so God moves in Love to Mankind, in this Seed in his Heart, at some
<PB N="148" REF="003129_0081_0FF004AC6BD40050"/>
singular times, setting his Sins in order before him, and seriously inviting him to Repentance, offering to him Remission of Sins and Salvation; which, if Man accept of, he may be saved. Now there is no Man alive, and I am confident there shall be none to whom this Paper shall come, who, if they will deal faithfully and honestly with their own Hearts but must be forced to acknowledge, they have been sensible of this in some measure less or more; which is a thing, that Man cannot bring up∣on himself, with all his Pains and Industry. This then, O Man and Woman! is the Day of God's gracious Visitation to thy Soul, which thou shalt be happy for ever, if thou resist not. This is the Day of the Lord, which as Christ saith, <HI>is like the Lightning which shineth from the</HI> East <HI>unto the</HI> West;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 24.27.</NOTE> and the <HI>Wind,</HI> or <HI>Spirit, which blows upon the Heart,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John. 3.8.</NOTE> <HI>and no Man knows whether it goes, nor whence it comes.</HI></P>
<P N="17"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Qu. 7.</NOTE>§. XVII. And <HI>lastly</HI>; This leads me to speak con∣cerning the manner of this <HI>Seed</HI> or <HI>Light's Operation in the Hearts of all Men,</HI> which will shew yet more manifestly, how we differ vastly from all those, that exalt a Natural Power or Light in Man; and how our Principle leads above all others, to attribute our whole Salvation to the meer Power, Spirit, and Grace of God.</P>
<P>To them then, that ask us after this manner, <HI>How do ye differ from the</HI> Pelagians <HI>and</HI> Arminians? <HI>For if two Men have equal sufficient</HI> Light <HI>and</HI> Grace, <HI>and the one be saved by it, and the other not; is it not because the one improves it, the other not? Is not then the Will of Man the Cause of the one's</HI> Salvation <HI>beyond the other</HI>? I say, to such we thus Answer: That as the Grace and Light in all, is sufficient to save all, and of its own. nature would save all; so it strives and wrestles with all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Light's Operation in order to Salvation.</NOTE> for to save them; he that resists its striving, is the cause of his own Condemnation; he that resists it not, it becomes
<PB N="149" REF="003129_0081_0FF004AC6BD40050"/>
his Salvation: So that in him that is saved, the working is of the Grace, and not of the Man; and it's a Passiveness, rather than an act; tho' after∣wards, as Man is wrought upon, there is a Will raised in him, by which he comes to be a co-worker with the Grace: For according to that of <HI>Augustin, He that made us without us, will not save us without us.</HI> So that the first step is not by Man's working, but by his not contrary-working. And we believe that at these singular Seasons of every Man's Visitation, above-mentioned; as Man is wholly unable of himself to work with the Grace, neither can he move one step out of the Natural Condition, until the Grace lay hold upon him; so it is possible to him to be passive, and not to resist it, as it is possible for him to resist it. So we say, the Grace of God works in and upon Man's Nature; which, tho' of it self wholly cor∣rupted and defiled, and prone to Evil; yet is ca∣pable to be wrought upon by the Grace of God; even as Iron, tho' a hard and cold Metal of it self, may be warm'd and softned by the heat of the Fire, and Wax melted by the Sun. And as Iron or Wax, when removed from the Fire or Sun, returneth to its former condition of coldness and hardness: So Man's Heart, as it resists, or retires from the Grace of God, returns to its former condition again. I have often had the manner of God's Working, in order to Salvation towards all Men, illustrated to my Mind, by one or two clear Examples, which I shall here add, for the Informa∣tion of others.</P>
<P>The first is, <HI>Of a Man heavily diseased</HI>; to whom I compare Man in his fallen and natural Condition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Exam∣ple of a Di∣seased Man and the Physician.</NOTE> I suppose God, who is the great Physician, not only to give this Man Physick, after he hath used all the Industry he can for his own Health, by any skill or knowledge of his own: (As those that say, <HI>If a Man improve his Reason, or Natural Faculties,
<PB N="150" REF="003129_0082_0FF004AEA63EE8A8"/>
God will super-add Grace: Or,</HI> as others say, <HI>That he cometh and maketh offer of a Remedy to this Man out∣wardly, leaving it to the liberty of Man's Will, either to receive it, or reject it.</HI>) But He, even the Lord, this great Physician, cometh, and poureth the Remedy into his Mouth, and as it were layeth him in his Bed; so that if the Sick Man be but passive, it will necessarily work the Effect: But if he be stubborn and untoward, and will needs arise up and go forth into the cold, or eat such Fruits as are hurtful to him, while the <HI>Medicine</HI> should operate; then, tho' of its nature it tendeth to cure him; yet it will prove destructive to him, because of those Obstru∣ctions, which it meeteth with. Now, as the Man that should thus undo himself, would certainly be the cause of his own Death; so who will say, that if cured, he owes not his Health wholly to the Phy∣sician, and not to any Deed of his own; seeing his part was not any Action, but a Passiveness?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Exam∣ple of Men lying stupi∣fied in a dark P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and their Deliverer.</NOTE>The Second Example is, <HI>Of divers Men lying in a dark Pit together, where all their</HI> Senses <HI>are so stupi∣fied, that they are scarce sensible of their own Misery:</HI> To this I compare Man, in his Natural, Corrupt, Fallen Condition. I suppose not, that any of these Men, wrestling to deliver themselves, do thereby stir up or engage one able to deliver them, to give them his help; saying with himself, <HI>I see one of these Men willing to be delivered, and doing what in him lies, therefore he deserves to be assisted</HI>; as say the <HI>Socinians, Pelagians,</HI> and <HI>Semi-Pelagians.</HI> Neither do I suppose, that this Deliverer comes to the top of the Pit, and puts down a Ladder, desiring them that will, to come up; and so puts them upon using their own Strength and Will to come up; as do the <HI>Jesuits</HI> and <HI>Arminians:</HI> Yet, as they say, such are not delivered without the Grace; seeing the Grace is that Lad∣der, by which they were delivered. But I suppose, that the Deliverer comes at certain times, and ful∣ly discovers and informs them of the great Misery
<PB N="151" REF="003129_0082_0FF004AEA63EE8A8"/>
and Hazard they are in, if they continue in that Noysom and Pestiferous Place; yea, forces them to a certain Sense of their Misery (for the wick∣edest Men, at times, are made sensible of their Mi∣sery by God's Visitation) and not only so, but lays hold upon them, and gives them a pull, in order to lift them out of their misery: Which, if they resist not, will save them; only they may resist it. This being applied as the former, doth the same way illustrate the matter. Neither is the Grace of God frustrated, though the Effect of it be divers, according to its Object; being the <HI>Ministration of Mercy and Love,</HI> in those that reject it not, but re∣ceive it, <HI>John</HI> 1.12. but the <HI>Ministration of Wrath and Condemnation,</HI> in those that do reject it, <HI>John</HI> 3.19. Even as the Sun, by one Act or Operation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Simile</HI> of the Sun's melting and hard∣ening <HI>&amp;c.</HI> power.</NOTE> melteth and softneth the Wax, and hardeneth the Clay. The nature of the Sun is to cherish the Creation, and therefore the Living are refreshed by it, and the Flowers send forth a good savour, as it shines upon them, and the Fruits of the Trees are ripened; yet cast forth a dead Carcase, a thing without Life, and the same reflection of the Sun will cause it to stink, and putrifie it; yet is not the Sun said thereby to be frustrated of its proper effect. So every Man, during the Day of his Visitation, is shined upon by the Sun of Righteousness, and ca∣pable of being influenced by it, so as to send forth good Fruit, and a good Savour, and to be melted by it; but when he hath sinned out his Day, then the same Sun hardeneth him, as it doth the Clay, and makes his Wickedness more to appear and putrifie, and send forth an evil Savour.</P>
<P N="18">§. XVIII. <HI>Lastly</HI>; As we truly affirm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All have Grace suf∣ficient for Salvation given them of God.</NOTE> That God willeth no Man to perish, and therefore hath given to all, Grace sufficient for Salvation; so we do not deny, but that in a special manner, he worketh in some, in whom Grace so prevaileth, that they ne∣cessarily obtain Salvation; neither doth God suffer
<PB N="152" REF="003129_0083_0FF004B1637EEA00"/>
them to resist. For it were absurd to say, that God had not far otherwise extended himself to∣wards the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> than towards many others: Neither can we affirm, that God equally loved the Beloved Disciple <HI>John,</HI> and <HI>Judas</HI> the Traitor; yet so far, nevertheless, as none wanted such a measure of Grace, by which they might have been saved; all are justly Inexcusable. And also, God working in those, to whom this prevalency of Grace is given, doth so hide himself, to shut out all Security and Presumption, that such may be humbled, and the free Grace of God mag∣nified, and all reputed to be of the Free-Gift; and nothing from the strength of Self. Those also who perish, when they remember those Times of God's Visitation towards them, wherein he wrestled with them by his <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> are forced to confess; that there was a time, wherein the Door of Mer∣cy was open unto them, and that they are justly Condemned, because they rejected their own Sal∣vation.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> Thus both the Mercy and Justice of God are established, and the Will and Strength of Man are brought down and rejected; his Condemnation is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de to be of himself, and his Salvation only to depend upon God. Also, by these Positions, two great Objections, which often are brought against this Doctrine, are well solved.</P>
<P>The first is deduced from these places of Scrip∣ture, wherein God seems precisely to have decreed and predestinated some to Salvation; and for that end, to have ordained certain means, which fall not out to others; as in the Calling of <HI>Abraham, David,</HI> and others, and in the Conversion of <HI>Paul</HI>; for these being numbred among such, to whom this prevalency is given, the Objection is easily loosed.</P>
<P>The second is drawn from those places, wherein God seems to have ordain'd some wicked Persons
<PB N="153" REF="003129_0083_0FF004B1637EEA00"/>
to Destruction; and therefore, to have obdurd their Hearts, to force them unto great Sins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Predestina∣tion to Sal∣vation, and Pre-or∣dination to Destru∣ction. <HI>Answered.</HI></NOTE> and to have raised them up, that he might shew in them his <HI>Power</HI>; who, if they be number'd amongst those Men, whose Day of Visitation is past over, that Objection is also solved; as will more evidently appear to any one, that will make a particular application of those things, which I at this time, for Brevity's sake, thought meet to pass over.</P>
<P N="19">§. XIX. Having thus clearly and evidently stated the Question, and opened our Mind and Judgment in this matter; as divers Objections are hereby pre∣vented, so it will make our Probation both the easier and the shorter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prop. I. <HI>Proved.</HI></NOTE> The first thing to be proved, is, <HI>That God hath given to every Man a Day or Time of Visitation, wherein it is possible for him to be saved.</HI> If we can prove, that there is a Day and Time given, in which those might have been saved that actually perish, the mat∣ter is done: For none deny, but those that are sa∣ved, have a Day of Visitation. This then appears, <MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="I"/> by the Regrets and Complaints, which the Spirit of God, throughout the whole Scriptures, makes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Those that perish had a Day of Mercy of∣fered them.</NOTE> even to those that did perish; challenging them, for that they did not accept of, nor close with God's Visitation, and Offer of Mercy to them. Thus the Lord expresses himself then first of all to <HI>Cain,</HI> Gen. 4.6, 7. <HI>And the Lord said unto</HI> Cain,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Instances.</HI> 1. Cain.</NOTE> <HI>Why art thou wroth? And why is thy countenance fallen? If thou dost well, shalt thou not be accepted? If thou dost not well, sin lieth at the door:</HI> This was said to <HI>Cain,</HI> before he slew his Brother <HI>Abel,</HI> when the Evil Seed began to tempt him, and work in his Heart; we see how God gave warning to <HI>Cain</HI> in season, and in the Day of his Visitation towards him, Ac∣ceptance and Remission, if he did well: For this Interrogation, <HI>Shalt thou not be accepted?</HI> imports an Affirmative, <HI>Thou shalt be accepted, if thou dost well.</HI> So that, if we may trust God Almighty, the
<PB N="154" REF="003129_0084_0FF004B3C588B3C8"/>
Fountain of all Truth and Equity, it was possible in a Day, even for <HI>Cain</HI> to be accepted. Nei∣ther could God have proposed the doing of <HI>Good,</HI> as a condition, if he had not given <HI>Cain</HI> sufficient strength; whereby he was capable to do <HI>Good.</HI> This the Lord himself also shews, even that he gave a Day of Visitation to the Old World, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2. <HI>The</HI> Old World.</NOTE> <HI>And the Lord said, My</HI> Spirit <HI>shall not always strive in Man</HI>; for so it ought to be translated. This manifestly implies, that his Spirit did strive with Man, and doth strive with him for a Season; which Season expiring, God ceaseth to strive with him, in order to save him: For the Spirit of God cannot be said to strive with Man, after the Day of his Visitation is expired; seeing it naturally, and without any resistance, works its effect then, to wit, continually to Judge and Condemn him. From this <HI>Day of Visitation,</HI> that God hath given to every one, it is, that he is said to <HI>wait to be Gracious,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">God is Long-suffe∣ring, and long wait∣ing to be Gracious unto all—</NOTE> Isai. 30.18. And to be <HI>Long-suffering,</HI> Exod. 34.6. Numb. 14.18. Psal. 86.15. Jer. 15.15. Here the Prophet <HI>Jeremy,</HI> in his Prayer, lays hold upon the Long-suffering of God; and in his Expo∣stulating with God, he shuts out the Objection of our Adversaries, in the 18th verse; <HI>Why is my Pain perpetual, and my Wound incurable, which refuseth to be healed? Wilt thou altogether be unto me as a Lyar, and as Waters that fail</HI>? Whereas, according to our Adversaries Opinion, the Pain of the most part of Men is perpetual, and their Wound altogether in∣curable: Yea, the Offer of the Gospel, and of Sal∣vation unto them, is as a Lye, and as Waters that fail, being never intended to be of any effect unto them. The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> saith expresly, that this <HI>Long-suffering of God waited, in the days of</HI> Noah, <HI>for those of the Old World,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.20. Which, being compared With that of <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3. before-mentioned, doth sufficiently hold forth our Proposition. And that none may object, that this <HI>Long-suffering,</HI> or
<PB N="155" REF="003129_0084_0FF004B3C588B3C8"/>
<HI>striving of the Lord,</HI> was not in order to save them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">—In order to save them.</NOTE> the same Apostle saith expresly, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.15. <HI>That the Long-suffering of God is to be accounted Salvation</HI>; and with this <HI>Long suffering,</HI> a little before in the 9th verse, he couples, <HI>That God is not willing that any should perish.</HI> Where, taking him to be his own Interpreter, (as he is most fit) he holdeth forth, That those to whom the Lord is <HI>Long-suffering,</HI> (which he declareth he was to the Wicked of the Old World, and is now to all, <HI>not willing that any should perish</HI>) they are <HI>to account this Long-suffering of God to them, Salvation.</HI> Now, how or in what respect can they count it <HI>Salvation,</HI> if there be not so much as a possibility of <HI>Salvation</HI> conveyed to them therein? For it were not Salvation to them, if they could not be saved by it. In this matter <HI>Peter</HI> further refers to the Writings of <HI>Paul,</HI> hold∣ing forth this, to have been the Universal Doctrine. Where it is observable, what he adds upon this oc∣casion, how <HI>there are some things in</HI> Paul<HI>'s Epistles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some things in <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>E∣pistles</HI> hard to be understood.</NOTE> <HI>hard to be understood, which the unstable and unlearned wrest to their own destruction</HI>; insinuating plainly this, of those Expressions in <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epistles, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 9. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which some <HI>unlearned</HI> in spiritual things, did make to contradict the Truth of <HI>God's Long-suffering towards all,</HI> in which he willeth not any of them should perish, and in which they all may be saved. Would to God many had taken more heed than they have done, to this Advertisement! That place of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> which <HI>Peter</HI> seems here most particularly to hint at, doth much contribute also to clear the matter, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.4. <HI>Despisest thou the Riches of his Goodness, and Forbearance, and Long-suffering, not knowing that the Goodness of God leadeth thee to Repentance? Paul</HI> speaketh here to the Unre∣generate, and to the Wicked, who (in the following verse, he saith) <HI>Treasure up Wrath unto the Day of Wrath</HI>; and to such he commends the <HI>Riches of the Forbearance and Long-suffering of God</HI>; shewing, that

the tendency of God's Goodness leadeth to Re∣pentance. How could it necessarily tend to <HI>lead them to Repentance?</HI> How could it be called <HI>Riches</HI> or <HI>Goodness</HI> to them, if there were not a Time, wherein they might Repent by it, and come to be sharers of the Riches exhibited in it?

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="III"/> <HI>Lastly</HI>; That there is a Day of Visitation given to the Wicked, wherein they might have been saved, and which being expired, they are shut out from Salvation, appears evidently by Christ's Lamentation over <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> expressed in three sundry places, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.37. <HI>Luke</HI> 13.34. and 19.41, 42. <HI>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it; saying, If thou hadst known,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ's La∣mentation over <HI>Jeru∣salem.</HI></NOTE> <HI>even thou, at least in this thy day, the things that be∣long to thy Peace; but now they are hid from thine Eyes</HI>!

willingness, as a <HI>Hen gathereth her Chickens.</HI> Such as is the Love and Care of the Hen toward her Brood, such is the Care of Christ, to gather lost Men and Women, to redeem them out of their corrupt and degenerate State. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That be∣cause they refused, the things belonging to their <HI>Peace were hid from their Eyes.</HI> Why were they hid? Because ye would not suffer me to <HI>gather you</HI>; ye would not see those things that were <HI>good for you,</HI> in the season of God's Love towards you; and therefore <HI>now,</HI> that day being expired, <HI>ye cannot see them</HI>: And for a farther Judgment, God suffers you to be hardened in Unbelief.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">God har∣dens, when?</NOTE>So it is, after real offer of Mercy and Salvation rejected, that God hardens Men's Hearts, and not before.

<P>Let us then observe, That this Seed of the King∣dom, this Saving, Supernatural, and Sufficient <HI>Word,</HI> was really sown in the Stony, Thorny Ground, and by the Way-side, where it did not profit, but be∣came useless, as to these Grounds: It was, I say, the same <HI>Seed,</HI> that was sown in the good Ground. It is then the fear of Persecution, and deceitful∣ness of Riches (as Christ himself interpreteth the Parable) which hindereth this Seed to grow in the Hearts of many: Not but that, in its own nature, it is sufficient; being the same with that which groweth up and prospereth in the Hearts of those who receive it.

Declaration of the Gospel be taken some∣times for the Gospel; yet it is but Figuratively, and by a <HI>Metonymy.</HI> For, to speak properly, the Gospel is this <HI>Inward Power</HI> and <HI>Life,</HI> which preach∣eth <HI>Glad Tidings</HI> in the Hearts of all Men, offering Salvation unto them, and seeking to Redeem them from their Iniquities; and therefore it is said to be preached <HI>In every Creature under Heaven:</HI> Whereas there are many Thousands of Men and Women, to whom the outward Gospel was never preached. Therefore the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. 1. where he saith, <HI>The</HI> Gospel <HI>is the</HI> Power of God <HI>unto Salvation,</HI> adds. That <HI>therein is revealed the</HI> Righteousness of God, <HI>from Faith to Faith</HI>; and also the <HI>Wrath of God against such as hold the Truth of God in unrighteousness:</HI> For this reason (saith he) <HI>Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.</HI> Now, that which may be known of God, is known by the Gospel, which was manifest in them. For those, of whom the Apostle speaks, had no out∣ward Gospel preached unto them; so that it was by the inward Manifestation of the Knowledge of God <HI>in them,</HI> which is indeed the Gospel preached in Man, <HI>that the</HI> Righteousness of God <HI>is revealed from Faith to Faith</HI>; that is, it reveals to the Soul that which is Just, Good and Righteous; and that, as the Soul receiveth it, and believes, Righteousness comes more and more to be revealed, from one degree of Faith to another. For tho' (as the fol∣lowing verse saith) the outward Creation declares the Power of God; yet <HI>that which may be known of him, is manifest within:</HI> By which Inward Manife∣station, we are made capable to see and discern the Eternal Power and Godhead in the outward Creation; so, were it not for this <HI>Inward Principle,</HI> we could no more understand the Invisible Things of God, by the outward visible Creation, than a Blind Man can see and discern the variety of Shapes and Colours, or judge of the Beauty of the outward

Creation. Therefore he saith First, <HI>That which may be known of God, is manifest in them</HI>; and in and by that, they may read and understand the Power and Godhead in those things that are outward and visible. And tho' any might pretend, that the out∣ward Creation doth, of it self, without any Super∣natural or Saving Principle in the Heart, even declare to the Natural Man, that there is a God; yet what would such a Knowledge avail, if it did not also communicate to me what the Will of God is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The out∣ward Crea∣tion may beget a Perswasion in Man of an Eternal Power o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vertue.</NOTE> and how I shall do that which is acceptable to him? For the outward Creation, tho' it may beget a Perswasion, that there is some Eternal Power or Vertue, by which the World hath had its begin¦ning; yet it doth not tell me, nor doth it inform me, of that which is Just, Holy and Righteous, how I shall be delivered from my Temptations and Evil Affections, and come unto Righteousness: That must be from some inward Manifestation in my Heart. Whereas those Gentiles, of whom the Apostle speaks, knew by that <HI>inward Law,</HI> and Manifestation of the Knowledge of God in them, to distinguish betwixt Good and Evil, as in the next Chapter appears, of which we shall speak hereafter. The Prophet <HI>Micah,</HI> speaking of Man indefinitely, or in general, declares this, <HI>Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 6.8. <HI>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good. And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do Justly, and to love Mercy, and to walk Humbly with thy God?</HI> He doth not say, God requires, till he hath first assured, that he hath shewed unto them. Now, because this is shewed unto All Men, and manifest <HI>in them</HI>; therefore saith the Apostle, is the Wrath of God <HI>revealed against them, for that they hold the Truth in Unrighteousness</HI>; that is, the Measure of Truth, the Light, the Seed, the Grace <HI>in them</HI>; for that they <HI>hide the Talent in the Earth</HI>; that is, in the earthly and unrighteous part in their Hearts, and suffer it not to bring forth Fruit, but to be choked

with the sensual Cares of this Life, the Fear of Re∣proach, and the Deceitfulness of Riches; as by the Parables above-mentioned doth appear. But the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> opens and illustrates this matter yet more, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10. where he declares, <HI>That the Word, which he preached,</HI> (now the <HI>Word,</HI> which he preached, and the <HI>Gospel</HI> which he preached, and whereof he was a Minister, is one and the same) <HI>is not far off, but nigh, in the Heart, and in the Mouth</HI>; which done, he frameth as it were the Objection of our Adversaries, in the 14th and 15th verses; <HI>How shall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard; And how shall they hear without a Preacher?</HI> This he an∣swers in the 18th verse, saying; <HI>But (I say) have they not heard?

<P>As to the first, tho' it be granted by most,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Part. <HI>Proved.</HI></NOTE> yet because it's more in Words than Deeds (the more full discussing of which, will fall in, in the next Proposition, concerning <HI>Justification</HI>) I shall prove it in few words. And first from the words of Christ to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> John 3.3. <HI>Verily, verily I say unto thee,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The New Birth (or Regenera∣tion) com∣eth not by the out∣ward Knowledge of Christ.</NOTE> <HI>Except a Man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.</HI> Now this Birth cometh not by the outward Preaching of the Gospel, or Know∣ledge of Christ or Historical Faith in him; seeing many have that, and firmly believe it who are never thus renewed. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> also goes so far, while he commends the Necessity and Ex∣cellency of this <HI>New Creation,</HI> as in a certain re∣spect, to lay aside the outward Knowledge of Christ, or the Knowledge of him after the Flesh, in these words, 2 <HI>Cor,</HI> 5.16, 17. <HI>Wherefore, hence∣forth know we no Man after the Flesh, yea, tho' we have known Christ after the Flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. Therefore if any Man be in Christ, he is a New Creature, old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.</HI> Whence it manifestly appears, that he makes the Knowledge of Christ after the Flesh, but as it were, the Rudiments which young Children learn; which, after they are become better Scholars, are of less use to them; because they have, and possess the very Substance of those first Precepts in their Minds. As all Comparisons halt in some part, so shall I not affirm this to hold in every respect; yet so far will this hold, that as those, that go no farther than the Rudiments, are never to be ac∣counted Learned; and as they grow beyond these things, so they have less use of them; even so such, as go no farther than the outward Knowledge of Christ, shall never inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. But such as come to know this <HI>New Birth,</HI> to be

in Christ indeed, to be a <HI>New Creature,</HI> to have <HI>Old Things past away, and all things become New,</HI> may safely say with the Apostle, <HI>Though we have known Christ after the Flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more.</HI> Now this <HI>New Creature</HI> proceeds from the Work of this <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> in the Heart:<NOTE PLACE="marg">—But by the Work of Light and Grace in the Heart.</NOTE> It is that Word, which we speak of, that is sharp and piercing, that <HI>Implanted Word,</HI> able to save the Soul, by which this Birth is begotten; and there∣fore Christ hath purchased unto us this Holy Seed, that thereby this Birth might be brought forth <HI>in us</HI> which is therefore also called, <HI>The Mani∣festation of the Spirit, given to every one to profit withal</HI>; for it is written, that <HI>by one Spirit we are all Baptized into one Body.</HI> And the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> also ascribeth this Birth to the Seed and Word of God which we have so much declared of, saying, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.23. <HI>Being born again, not of Corruptible Seed, but of Incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</HI> Tho' then this Seed be small in its Appearance, so that Christ compares it to a <HI>Grain of Mustard-Seed, which is the least of all Seeds,</HI> Mat. 13.31, 32. and that it be hid in the earthly part of Man's Heart: Yet therein is Life and Sal∣vation towards the Sons of Men wrap'd up; which comes to be revealed, as they give way to it.

And it is thus to preach Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">None are sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by the Know∣ledge of the History, but by the Op∣eration of the Light of Christ in the Mystery</NOTE> and direct People to his pure Light in the Heart, that God hath raised us up, and for which the Wise Men of this World account us Fools; because, by the Opera∣tion of this Cross of Christ in our Hearts, we have denied our own Wisdom and Wills in many things, and have forsaken the vain Worships, Fa∣shions and Customs of this World.

Hence the Devil matters not how much of that Knowledge abounds, provided, he can but possess the Heart, and rule in the Will, crucifie the Appearance of Christ there, and so keep the Seed of the Kingdom from taking Root. For he has led them abroad, <HI>lo here,</HI> and <HI>lo there</HI>; and has made them wrestle in a false Zeal, so much one against another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Contentiors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it out∣ward Obser∣vations, and Lo here's.</NOTE> contending for this outward Observation, and for the other out∣ward Observation, seeking Christ in this and the other External Thing, as in <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI>; con∣tending one with another how he is there, while some will have him to be present therein this way, and some nhe other way; and some in Scrip∣tures, in Books, in Societies, and Pilgrimages, and Merits.

<P>But to those Arguments, by which it hath been proved, <HI>That all Men have a Measure of saving Grace,</HI> I shall add one, and that very observable, not yet mentioned, <HI>viz.</HI> that excellent Saying of the Apo∣stle <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Titus,</HI> chap. 2. v. 11. <HI>The Grace of God, that brings</HI> Salvation, <HI>hath appeared to all Men; teach∣ing us, that denying Ungodliness and Worldly Lusts, we should live Soberly, Righteously, and Godlily in this present World</HI>: Than which, there can be nothing more clear, it comprehending both the parts of the Controversie. First; it testifies, that it is no Natural Principle or Light, but saith plainly, <HI>It brings Salvation.</HI> Secondly; it says not, that it hath appeared to a <HI>Few,</HI> but <HI>unto All Men.</HI> The Fruit of it declares also how Efficacious it is, seeing it comprehends the whole Duty of Man:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Saving Grace of God, teach∣ing the whole Duty of Man.</NOTE> It both teacheth us, first, to forsake Evil, to deny Ungod∣liness and Worldly Lusts; and then it teacheth us our whole Duty.

And Lastly, <HI>Godlily</HI>; which comprehends Piety, Faithfulness and Devotion; which are the Duties relating to God. So then there is nothing required of Man, or is needful to Man, which this Grace teacheth not. Yet I have heard a publick Preacher, (one of those that are accounted Zealous Men) to evite the strength of this Text, deny this Grace to be Saving, and say; <HI>It was only intended of common Favours and Graces, such as is the Heat of the</HI> Fire, <HI>and outward Light of the</HI> Sun. Such is the Darkness and Ignorance of those that oppose the Truth; whereas the Text saith expresly,

that it is <HI>Saving.</HI> Others, that cannot deny, but it is <HI>Saving,</HI> alledge;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Absur∣dity of our Adversa∣ries com∣ment upon the word <HI>All,</HI> deny∣ing Grace to be Sa∣ving. <HI>Tit. 2.11.</HI></NOTE> This (<HI>All</HI>) comprehends not every Individual, but only All Kinds: But is a bare Negation sufficient to overturn the strength of a positive Assertion? If the Scriptures may be so abu∣sed, what so absurd, as may be not pleaded for from them? Or what so manifest, as may not be denied? But we have no reason to be staggered by their denying, so long as our Faith is found in express terms of the Scripture; they may as well seek to perswade us, that we do not intend that which we affirm (tho' we know the contrary) as make us believe, that when the Apostle speaks forth our Doctrine in plain words, yet he intends theirs, which is the quite contrary. And indeed, can there be any thing more absurd, than to say, Where the word is plainly (<HI>All) Few</HI> is only in∣tended? For they will not have (<HI>All</HI>) taken here for the <HI>greater Number.</HI> Indeed, as the Case may be sometimes, by a Figure (<HI>All</HI>) may be taken, of two Numbers, for the greater Number; but let them shew us, if they can, either in Scrip∣ture, or Profane or Ecclesiastical Writings, that any Man that wrote Sense, did ever use the word (<HI>All</HI>) to express, of two Numbers, the lesser. Whereas they affirm, that the far lesser Number have received Saving Grace; and yet will they have the Apostle, by (<HI>All</HI>) to have signified so, Tho' this might suffice; yet to put it further, be∣yond all question, I shall Instance another Saying of the same Apostle, that we may use him as his own Commentator; <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.18. <HI>Therefore as by the Offence of One, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation; even so by the Righteousness of One, the Free Gift came upon all Men unto Justification of Life.</HI> Here no Man of Reason, except he will be obstinately ignorant, will deny, but this similitive Particle (<HI>As</HI>) makes the (<HI>All</HI>) which goes before, and comes after, to be of one and the same extent: Or else let them

</P>
<P>From all which it naturaly follows, that All Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Even the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s may be sa∣ved by the Light.</NOTE> even the <HI>Heathens,</HI> may be saved: For <HI>Christ</HI> was given, as a <HI>Light to enlighten the Gentiles,</HI> Isai. 49.6. Now, to say that tho they might have been saved, yet none were, is to judge too Uncharitably. I see not what Reason can be alledged for it; yea, tho' it were granted, which never can be, that none of the <HI>Heathens</HI> were saved; it will not from thence follow, that they could not have been saved. or that none now in their Condition can be saved; For, <HI>A non esse ad non passe non detur sequella</HI>; i. e.

<P><HI>Therefore they (not knowing this) cannot be saved.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; Tho' they know it not outwardly, yet if they feel it inwardly, by feeling the Ver∣tues and Power of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Literal Knowledge of Christ is not sav∣ing his the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ex∣perimented.</NOTE> the Name <HI>JESUS</HI> indeed, (which signifies a <HI>Saviour</HI>) to free them from Sin and iniquity in their Hearts, they are saved by it. I confess, there is no other Name to be saved by: But Salvation lieth not in the Literal, but in the Experimental Knowledge; albeit those that have the Literal Knowledge, are not saved by it, with∣out this real Experimental Knowledge: Yet those
<PB N="185" REF="003129_0099_0FF004DA2491A608"/>
that have the Real Knowledge, may be saved with∣out the External; as by the Arguments hereafter brought, will more appear. For if the outward distinct Knowledge of him, by whose means I re∣ceive benefit, were necessary for me, before I could reap any Fruit of it; then, by the Rule of Contra∣ries, it would follow, that I could recieve no hurt, without I had also the distinct Knowledge of him that occasioned it; whereas Experience proves the contrary. How many are injured by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, that know nothing of ever there being such a Man in the World, or of his eating the Forbidden Fruit? Why may they not then be saved by the Gift and Grace of Christ in them, making them Righteous and Holy, tho' they know not distinctly how that was purchased unto them by the death and Sufferings of <HI>Jesus,</HI> that was Crucified at <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI>; especially seeing God hath made that Know∣ledge simply impossible to them? As many Men are killed, by Poison infused into their Meat, tho' they neither know what the Poison was, nor who infused it: So also on the other hand, how many are cured of their Diseases, by good Remedies, who know not how the Medicine is prepared, what the In∣gredients are, nor oftentimes who made it? The like may also hold in Spiritual Things, as we shall hereafter prove.</P>
<P N="26">§. XXVI. First; If there were such an abloute necessity for this outward Knowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The out∣ward Knowledge not essen∣tial to Sal∣vation: Instance, Infants &amp; deaf Per∣sons.</NOTE> that it were even of the Essentials of Salvation, then none could be saved without it; whereas our Adversaries deny not, but readily confess, that many Infants and Deaf Persons are saved without it: So that here they break that General Rule, and make Salvation possible without it. Neither can they alledge, that it is because such are free from Sin; seeing they also affirm, that all Infants, because of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Sin, deserve Eternal Condemnation, as being really guilty in the sight of God; and of Deaf People, it
<PB N="186" REF="003129_0100_0FF004DBDB1AACC8"/>
is not to be doubted, and Experience shews us, that they are subject to many common Iniquities, as well as other Men.</P>

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="2"/> If they say, <HI>Deaf People may be made sensible of the Gospel by Signs:</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> All the Signs cannot give them any explicit Knowledge of the History of the Death, Sufferings, and Resurrection of Christ.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="3"/> And if they should further alledge, <HI>That they are within the Bosom of the visible Church, and Partakers of the Sacraments</HI>:</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> All that gives no certainty of Salvation; for (as the <HI>Protestants</HI> confess) they confer not Grace <HI>ex opere opexato.</HI> And will they not acknowledge, that many are in the Bosom of the Church, who are visibly no Members of it? But if this Charity be extended towards such, who are where the Gospel is preached, so that they may be judged capable of Salvation, because they are under a simple im∣possibility of distinctly knowing the means of Sal∣vation; what Reason can be alledged, why the like Charity may not be had to such, as tho' they can hear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Chinees</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> excusable for not knowing the History of the Death of Christ, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> yet are under a simple impossibility of Hear∣ing, because it is not spoken unto them. Is not a Man in <HI>China,</HI> or in <HI>India,</HI> as much to be excu∣sed for not knowing a thing which he never heard of, as a deaf Man here, who cannot hear? For as the deaf Man is not to be blam'd, because God
<PB N="187" REF="003129_0100_0FF004DBDB1AACC8"/>
hath been pleased to suffer him to lie under this In∣firmity; so is the <HI>Chinees,</HI> or the <HI>Indian,</HI> as excusable, because God hath with held from him the oppor∣tunity of Hearing. He that cannot hear a thing, as being necessarily absent, and he that connot hear it, as being naturally deaf, are to be placed in the same Category.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="2"/> Secondly; This manifestly appears by that Say∣ing of <HI>Peter,</HI> Acts 10.34. <HI>Of a Truth I perceive, that God is no respecter of Persons; but in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh Righteousness, is accepted of him. Peter</HI> was before liable to that mistake, that the rest of the <HI>Jews</HI> were in, judging that all were Unclean, except themselves, and that no Man could be saved, except they were Proselyted to their Religion, and Circumised. But God shewed <HI>Peter</HI> otherways in a Vision, and taught him to call nothing <HI>common</HI> or <HI>unclean</HI>; and therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">God re∣garded the Prayers of <HI>Cornelius,</HI> a stranger to the Law.</NOTE> seeing that God regarded the Prayers of <HI>Cornelius,</HI> who was a stranger to the Law, and to Jesus Christ, as to the outward; yet <HI>Peter</HI> saw that God had ac∣cepted him; and he is said to <HI>fear God,</HI> before he had this outward Knowledge: Therefore <HI>Peter</HI> con∣cludes, that every one, that in every Nation, with∣out Respect of Persons, feareth God, and worketh Righteousness is accepted of him. So he makes the Fear of God, and the Working of Righteous∣ness, and not an outward Historical Knowledge the <HI>Qualification</HI>: They then that have this, where∣ever they be, they are saved. Now we have al∣ready proved, that to every Man that Grace is given whereby he may live Godlily and Righte∣ously; and we see, that by this Grace <HI>Cornelius</HI> did so, and was accepted, and his Prayers came up for a Memorial before God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From what Scripture and <HI>Job</HI> learn his excellent knowledge?</NOTE> before he had this out∣ward Knowledge.

And from what Scripture learned he that excellent

Knowledge he had, and that Faith, by which he knew his <HI>Redeemer lived</HI>? (For many make him as old as <HI>Moses)</HI> Was not this by an Inward Grace in the Heart? Was it not that Inward Grace, that taught <HI>Job</HI> to eschew Evil, and to fear God? And was it not by the Workings thereof, that he became a just and upright Man?

And after he hath numbered up their Wickedness, doth he not con∣demn them, <HI>vers.</HI> 13. for <HI>Rebelling</HI> against this <HI>Light,</HI> for not knowing the Way thereof, nor abiding in the Paths thereof? It appears then, <HI>Job</HI> believed that Men had a Light, and that because they Re∣belled against it, therefore they knew not its Ways, and abode not in its Paths: Even as the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> who had the Scriptures, are said to <HI>Err,</HI> not know∣ing the Scripture And also <HI>Job</HI>'s Friends, tho' in some things wrong;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job</HI>'s Friends, their excel∣lent Say∣ings.</NOTE> yet who taught them all those excellent Savings and Knowledge which they had?

And who dare say, that they are Damned? But further, the Apostle puts this Controversie out of doubt; for, if we may believe his plain Assertions, he tells us, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.

<P>All, that know but a Conclusion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> justi∣fied doing the Law.</NOTE> do easily see what follows from these express words of the Apo∣stle. And indeed, he, through that whole Chapter labours, as if he were Contending now with our Adversaries, to confirm this Doctrine, verse. 9, 10, 11. <HI>Tribulation and Anguish upon</HI> every Soul of Man <HI>that doth evil, to the</HI> Jew <HI>first, and also to the</HI> Gentile: <HI>For there is no Respect of Persons with God.</HI> Where the Apostle clearly <HI>Homologates,</HI> or confesses to the Sen∣tence of <HI>Peter</HI> before mentioned; and shews, that <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile,</HI> or as himself explains in the following Verses, both they that have an outward Law, and they that have none, when they <HI>do good,</HI> shall be <HI>justified.</HI> And to put us out of all doubt, in the very following Verses, he tells, That <HI>the Doers of the Law are justified,</HI> and that the <HI>Gentiles did the Law.</HI> So that except we think, he spake not what he intended, we may safely conclude, that such <HI>Gentiles</HI> were Justified and did partake of that Honour, Glory and Peace which comes upon every one that doth <HI>good</HI>; even the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that are without the Law, when they <HI>work good</HI>; see∣ing with God there is <HI>no Respect of Persons.</HI> So as we see, that it is not the having the Outward

Knowledge that doth save, without the Inward; so neither doth the want of it, to such to whom God hath made it impossible, who have the In∣ward, bring Condemnation. And many that have wanted the Outward, have had a knowledge of this Inwardly, by Vertue of that Inward Grace and Light given to every Man, working in them, by which they forsook Iniquity and become Just and Holy as is above proved;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Many wanting the History, were sensi∣ble of the Loss by <HI>A∣dam</HI> and Salvation come by Christ in themselves</NOTE> who, tho' they knew not the History of <HI>Adam</HI>'s Fall, yet were sensible in themselves of the Loss that came by it, feeling their Inclinations to Sin, and the Body of Sin in them: And tho' they knew not the Coming of Christ, yet were sensible of that Inward Power and Salvation which came by him, even before, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well as since his Appearance in the Flesh.

<P>As many as resist not this <HI>Light,</HI> but receive the same, it becomes in them a Holy, Pure and Spiritual Birth, bringing forth Holiness, Righteousness, Purity, and all those other Blessed Fruits which are acceptable to <HI>God,</HI> by which Holy Birth, to wit, <HI>Jesus Christ formed within us,</HI> and working his Works in us, as we are Sanctified so are we justified in the sight of God, ac∣cording to the Apostle's words; <HI>But ye are Washed, but ye are Sanctified, but ye are Justified, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God, 1 Cor. 6.11.</HI> Therefore it is not by our Works, wrought in our Will, nor yet by Good Works, considered as of themselves; but by <HI>Christ,</HI> who is both the <HI>Gift</HI> and the <HI>Giver,</HI> and the Cause producing the Effects in us; who as he hath reconciled us, while we were Ene∣mies, doth also in his <HI>Wisdom</HI> save us, and justify us after this manner, as saith the same Apostle else∣where; <HI>According to his Mercy he saved us, by the washing of Regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost,</HI> Tit. <HI>3.5.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<PB N="197" REF="003129_0105_0FF004E1CBFFCED0"/>
<P N="1">§. 1. THE <HI>Doctrine of Justification</HI> comes well in order, after the discussing of the Extent of Christ's Death, and of the Grace thereby com∣municated; some of the sharpest Contests concern∣ing this having from thence their Rise. Many are the Disputes among those called <HI>Christians,</HI> con∣cerning this point; and indeed, if all were truly minding that which Justifieth, there would be less Noise about the <HI>Notions of Justification.</HI> I shall briefly review this Controversie, as it stands among others, and as I have often seriously observed it; then in short state the Controversie, as to us, and open our Sense and Judgment of it: And <HI>lastly,</HI> prove it (if the Lord will) by some Scripture-Testimonies, and the certain Experience of all that ever were truly Justified.</P>
<P N="2">§. II.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Observ. 1.</NOTE> That this <HI>Doctrine of Justification</HI> hath been and is greatly vitiated in the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Method of Justifi∣cation tak∣en by the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI></NOTE> is not by us questioned; tho' our Adversaries (who for want of better Arguments, do often make Lyes their Refuge) have not spared in this respect to Stigmatize us with Popery; but how untruly, will hereafter appear. For to speak little of their <HI>Meritum ex Condigno,</HI> which was (no doubt) a very common Doctrine of the <HI>Romish Church,</HI> especially before <HI>Luther</HI>; tho' most of their Modern Wri∣ters, especially in their Controversies with Prote∣stants do partly deny it, partly qualifie it, and seem to state the matter only, as if they were Propagaters and Pleaders for Good Works, by the others denied. Yet if we look to the Effects of this Doctrine among them, as they appear in the generality of their Church-Members, not in things disapproved, but highly approved and commend∣ed by their Father the <HI>Pope,</HI> and all his <HI>Clients,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pope's Doctrine of <HI>Merits,</HI> the most benefi∣cial of all his <HI>Reve∣nues.</HI></NOTE> as the most beneficial Casuality of all his Reve∣venue; we shall find, that <HI>Luther</HI> did not without great ground oppose himself to them in this mat∣ter: And if he had not run himself into another
<PB N="198" REF="003129_0106_0FF004E52AB624A0"/>
extream (of which heareafter) his Work would have stood the better. For in this, as in most other things, he is more to be commended, for what he pull'd down of <HI>Babylon,</HI> than for what he built of his own. Whatever then the <HI>Papists</HI> may pretend, or even some good Men among them may have thought. Experience sheweth, and it is more than manifest, by the universal and ap∣proved Practice of their People, that they place not their <HI>Justification</HI> so much in Works that are truly and morally Good, and in the being truly renewed and sanctified in the Mind, as in such things as are either nor Good nor Evil, or may truly be called Evil, and can no otherways be reckoned Good, than because the <HI>Pope</HI> pleases to call them so.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Papists</HI> Ju∣stification depends upon the Pope's Bulls</NOTE> So that if the matter be well sifted, it will be found that the greatest part of their <HI>Justification</HI> depends upon the Authority of his <HI>Bulls,</HI> and not upon the Power, Vertue and Grace of <HI>Christ,</HI> revealed in the Heart, and renewing of it; as will appear, <MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="I"/> <HI>First,</HI> From their Principle concerning their <HI>Sacraments,</HI> which they say, <HI>confer Grace, ex opere operato.</HI> So that if a Man partake but of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Sa∣craments.</NOTE> he thereby obtains Remission of Sin, tho' he remains as he was; the Vertue of the <HI>Sacre∣ments</HI> making up the want that is in the Man. So that this Act of Submission and Faith to the Laws of the Church, and not any real inward Change, is that which justifieth him. As for Example; if a Man make use of the Sacrament (as they call it) <HI>of Pennance,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Papists <HI>Pennance.</HI></NOTE> so as to tell over his Sins to a Priest, tho' he have not true <HI>Contrition</HI> (which the Lord hath made absolutely necessary for Penitent Sinners) but only <HI>Attrition,</HI> a Figment of their own) that is, If he be sorry he hath sinned, not out of any love to God, or his Law, which he hath transgressed, but for fear of Punishment; yet doth the Vertue of the Sacrament (as they affirm) procure to him Remission of Sins; so that being absolved by the
<PB N="199" REF="003129_0106_0FF004E52AB624A0"/>
Priest, he stands accepted and justified in the sight of God. This Man's Justification then procceedeth not from his being truly Penitent, and in any mea∣sure inwardly changed and renewed, by the work∣ing of God's Grace in his Heart; but meerly from the Vertue of the Sacrament, and Authority of the <HI>Priest,</HI> who hath pronounced him <HI>Absolved</HI>; so that his Justification is from somewhat without him, and not within him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="II"/> <HI>Secondly</HI>; This will yet more appear in the mat∣ter of <HI>Indulgences,</HI> where Remission of all Sins,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Papist-In∣dulgences.</NOTE> not only past, but for years to come, is annexed to the visiting such and such <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Reliques,</HI> saying such and such <HI>Prayers</HI>; so that the Person that so doth, is presently cleared from the guilt of his Sin, and justified and accepted in the sight of God. As for Example:
<Q>He that in the great <HI>Jubilee,</HI> will go to <HI>Rome,</HI> and present himself before the Gate of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and there receive the <HI>Pope</HI>'s <HI>Blessing</HI>; or he that will go a Pilgrimage to <HI>James</HI>'s Sepulchre in <HI>Spain,</HI> or to <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Loretto,</HI> is upon the performance of those things promised For∣giveness of Sin. Now if we ask them the Rea∣son how such things, as are not morally good in themselves, come to have Vertue? They have no other answer, but <HI>because of the Church's and Pope</HI>'s <HI>Authority</HI>; who being the great Treasurer of the Magazine of <HI>Christ's Merits,</HI> lets them out upon such and such Conditions. Thus also the inven∣tion of saying <HI>Mass,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Papists-Mass, what it is?</NOTE> is made a chief Instrument of <HI>Justification</HI>; for in it they pretend to offer <HI>Christ</HI> daily to the Father, a <HI>Propitiatory Sacrifice</HI> for the Sins of the Living and Dead: So that a Man, for Money, can procure <HI>Christ</HI> thus to be offer'd for him when he pleases: by which Offering he is said to obtain Remission of Sins, and to stand Justified in the sight of God. From all which, and much more of this nature which might be mentioned, it doth appear, that the <HI>Papists</HI> place their Justification,
<PB N="200" REF="003129_0107_0FF004E6DEB91CC0"/>
not so much in any Work of Holiness, really brought forth in them, and real forsaking of Ini∣quity, as in the meer Performance of some Cere∣monies, and a blind Belief which their Teachers have begotten in them; that the <HI>Church</HI> and the <HI>Pope,</HI> having the absolute Dispensation of the <HI>Merits of Christ,</HI> have power to make these Merits effectual for the Remission of Sins, and Justifica∣tion of such, as will perform those Ceremonies.</Q>
This is the true and real method of Justification, taken by the generality of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and highly commended by their publick Preachers, especially the <HI>Monks,</HI> in their Sermons to the Peo∣ple; of which I my self have been an Ear and an Eye-witness: However some of their modern Wri∣ters have laboured to qualifie it in their Contro∣versies.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luther</HI> and the Protest∣ants oppo∣sing the Pope's Doc∣trine of Works, fell into the other Ex∣tream, of no Good Works ne∣cessary to Justifica∣tion.</NOTE> This Doctrine <HI>Luther</HI> and the <HI>Protestants</HI> then had good Reason to deny and oppose; tho' many of them ran into another Extream, so as to deny <HI>Good Works to be necessary to Justification</HI>; and to preach up, <HI>not only Remission of Sins, but Justification by Faith alone, without all Works, however good.</HI> So that Men do not obtain their Justification, according as they are inwardly Sanctified and Renewed; but are Justified meerly by Believing that <HI>Christ died for them</HI>; and so some may perfectly be Justified, tho' they be lying in gross Wickedness; as appears by the Example of <HI>David,</HI> who they say was fully and perfectly Justified, while he was lying in the gross Sins of <HI>Murder</HI> and <HI>Adultery.</HI> As then the <HI>Protestants</HI> have sufficient ground to quarrel and confute the <HI>Papists,</HI> concerning those many Abuses in the matter of Justification; shewing how the <HI>Do∣ctrine of Christ</HI> is thereby vitiated and overturned, and the <HI>Word of God</HI> made void by many and use∣less Traditions, the <HI>Law of God</HI> neglected, while foolish and needless <HI>Ceremonies</HI> are prized and fol∣lowed, through a false Opinion of being Justified by the performance of them; and the <HI>Merits</HI> and
<PB N="201" REF="003129_0107_0FF004E6DEB91CC0"/>
<HI>Sufferings</HI> of Christ (which is the only <HI>Sacrifice</HI> ap∣pointed of God for Remission of Sins) derogated from, by the setting up of a daily <HI>Sacrifice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Papists De∣vice to get Money.</NOTE> never appointed by God, and chiefly devised out of Co∣vetousness to get Money by: So the <HI>Protestants,</HI> on the other hand, by not rightly establishing and holding forth the Doctrine of Justification, accord∣ing as it is delivered in the Holy Scriptures, have opened a Door for the <HI>Papists</HI> to accuse them, as if they were Neglecters of Good Works, Enemies to Mortification and Holiness, such as esteem them∣selves Justified, while lying in great Sins: By which kind of Accusations (for which too great ground hath been given out of the Writings of some <HI>rigid Protestants</HI>) the Reformation hath been greatly de∣famed and hindered, and the Souls of many in∣snared. Whereas who will narrowly look into the matter, may observe these Debates to be more <HI>in specie,</HI> than <HI>in genere,</HI> seeing both do upon the matter <HI>land in one,</HI> and like two Men in a Circle, who tho' they go sundry ways, yet meet at last in the same Centre.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Papists,</HI> they say;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Papists Be∣lief of Ju∣stification meets in the same Centre with the—</NOTE> <HI>They obtain</HI> Remission of Sins, <HI>and are justified by the Merits of Christ, as the same are applied unto them in the use of the</HI> Sacraments of the Church; <HI>and are dispensed in the Performance of such and such Ceremonies, Pilgrimages, Prayers and Per∣formances, tho' there be not an inward Renewing of the Mind, nor knowing of Christ inwardly formed; yet they are remitted, and made Righteous,</HI> ex opere operato, <HI>because of the Power and Authority accompanying the</HI> Sacraments, <HI>and the</HI> Dispensers <HI>of them.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Protestants</HI> say;<NOTE PLACE="marg">—Prote∣stants Be∣lief.</NOTE> <HI>That they obtain</HI> Rimission of Sins, <HI>and stand justified in the sight of God, by Vertue of the</HI> Merits <HI>and</HI> Sufferings <HI>of Christ; not by infusing Righteousness into them, but by pardoning their Sins,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>So saith the</HI> West∣minster Confession of Faith, <HI>Chap.</HI> 11. <HI>Sect.</HI> 1.</NOTE> <HI>and by accounting &amp; accepting their Persons as righteous; they resting on Him and his Righteousness by</HI> Faith; <HI>which</HI> Faith, <HI>the Act of Believing, is not imputed unto them for Righteousness.</HI></P>
<PB N="202" REF="003129_0108_0FF004EA02A6E0F8"/>
<P>So the <HI>Justification</HI> of neither here is placed in any Inward Renewing of the Mind, or by Vertue of any Spiritual Birth, or Formation of Christ in them; but only by a bare Application of the Death and Sufferings of Christ, outwardly performed for them: Whereof the one lays hold on a Faith rest∣ing upon them, and hoping to be justified by them alone; the other, by the saying of some outward Prayers and Ceremonies, which they judge makes the Death of Christ effectual unto them. I except here (being unwilling to wrong any) what things have been said, as to the necessity of inward Holi∣ness, either by some <HI>modern Papists,</HI> or some <HI>modern Protestants,</HI> who in so far as they have laboured af∣ter a Midst betwixt these two Extreams, have come near to the Truth; as by some Citations out of them, hereafter to be mentioned, will appear: Tho' this Doctrine hath not, since the Apostacy, (so far as ever I could observe) been so distinctly and evidently held forth, according to the Scrip∣ture Testimony, as it hath pleased God to reveal it, and preach it forth in this Day, by the Wit∣nesses of his Truth, whom he hath raised to that end.

<P><HI>Secondly</HI>; God manifested this <HI>Love</HI> towards us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expl. 2.</NOTE> in the sending of his Beloved Son, the Lord <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> into the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ gi∣ving him∣self a Sacri∣fice for us.</NOTE> who gave himself for us an <HI>Offering</HI> and a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to God, for a <HI>sweet-smelling Savour</HI>; and having made Peace through the Blood of his <HI>Cross,</HI> that he might reconcile us unto him∣self, and by the Eternal Spirit offered himself without Spot unto God, and suffered for our Sins, the <HI>Just</HI> for the <HI>Unjust,</HI> that he might bring us unto God.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI> then; Forasmuch as all Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expl. 3.</NOTE> who have come to Man's Estate, (the Man <HI>Jesus</HI> only ex∣cepted) have sinned, therefore All have need of this Saviour, to remove the Wrath of God from them, due to their Offences; in this respect he is truly said, to <HI>have born the Iniquities of us All, in his Body on the Tree</HI>; and therefore is the <HI>Only Mediator,</HI> having qualified the Wrath of God towards us; so that our former Sins stand not in our way, being by Vertue of his most Satisfactory Sacrifice removed and pardoned. Neither do we think, that Remis∣sion of Sins is to be expected, sought,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To Rem∣ission of Sins.</NOTE> or obtained any other way, of by any works or Sacrifice what∣soever. (Tho' as has been said formerly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The only Mediator betwixt God and Man.</NOTE> they may come to partake of this Remission, that are igno∣rant of the History.) So then Christ, by his Death and Sufferings, hath Reconciled us to God, even while we are Enemies; that is, he offers Reconci∣liation unto us; we are put into a capacity of be∣ing Reconciled; God is willing to forgive us our Iniquities, and to accept us; as is well expressed by the Apostle, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.19. <HI>God was in Christ, re∣conciling the World unto himself, not imputing their Trespasses unto them, and hath put in us the Word of Reconciliation.</HI> And therefore the Apostle, in the next Verses, intreats them, in <HI>Christ's stead, to be Re∣conciled to God</HI>; intimating, that the Wrath of God, being removed by the Obedience of <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> he is willing to be Reconciled unto them, and
<PB N="204" REF="003129_0109_0FF004ED1628E5B8"/>
ready to remit the Sins that are past, if they Re∣pent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Twofold Redemp∣tion.</NOTE>We consider then our Redemption in a twofold respect or state; both which in their own nature are perfect, though in their application to us, the one is not, nor cannot be, without respect to the other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1.</HI> The Re∣demption of Christ without us.</NOTE>The <HI>First</HI> is, The Redemption performed and ac∣complished by <HI>Christ for us,</HI> in his Crucified Body, without us: The other is the Redemption wrought by <HI>Christ in us</HI>; which no less properly is called and accounted a Redemption than the former. The <HI>first</HI> then is that whereby a Man, as he stands in the Fall, is put into a capacity of Salvation, and hath conveyed unto him a measure of that Power, Vertue, Spirit, Life and Grace, that was in Christ Jesus; which, as the Free-Gift of God, is able to counter-ballance, overcome, and root out the Evil Seed, wherewith we are naturally, as in the Fall, leavened.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2.</HI> The Re∣demption wrought by Christ in us.</NOTE> The <HI>Second</HI> is that, whereby we witness and know this pure and perfect Redemption <HI>in our selves,</HI> purifying, cleansing and redeeming us from the power of Corruption, and bringing us into Unity, Favour and Friendship with God. By the <HI>first</HI> of these two, we that were lost in <HI>Adam,</HI> plunged in the bitter and corrupt Seed, unable of our selves to do any good thing, but naturally joyned and united to Evil, forward and propense to all Iniquity, servants and slaves to the power and spirit of Darkness, are notwithstanding all this, so far Reconciled to God by the Death of his Son, while Enemies, that we are put into a capacity of Salvation; having the Glad-Tidings of the Gospel of Peace offered unto us; and God is Reconciled unto us in Christ, calls and invites us to himself; in which respect we understand these Scriptures: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Eph. 2.15. 1 Joh 4.10. Ezek. 16.6. 1 Pet. 2.22.24. &amp; 3.18.</NOTE> <HI>He slew the Enmity in himself. He loved us first; seeing us in our Blood, he said unto us, Live; he, who
<PB N="205" REF="003129_0109_0FF004ED1628E5B8"/>
did not sin his own self, bare our sins in his own Body on the Tree; and he died for our sins, the Just for the Unjust.</HI></P>
<P>By the <HI>Second,</HI> we witness this capacity brought into Act; whereby receiving, and not resisting, the purchase of his Death, to wit, the Light, Spirit, and Grace of <HI>Christ</HI> revealed to us, we witness and possess a real, true and inward Redemption from the power and prevalency of Sin; and so come to be truly and really Redeemed, Justified, and made Righteous, and to a sensible Union and Friendship with God. Thus <HI>he died for us, that he might Redeem us from all Iniquity</HI>; and thus <HI>we know him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Titus 2.14. Phil. 3.12.</NOTE> <HI>and the Power of his Resurrection, and the Fellowship of his Suf∣ferings, being made conformable to his Death.</HI> This last follows the first in order, and is a conseqence of it, proceeding from it, as an <HI>Effect</HI> from its <HI>Cause</HI>; so as none could have enjoyed the last, without the first had been (such being the Will of God;) so also can none now partake of the first, but as he witnesseth the last. Wherefore as to us, they are Both Causes of our Justification: The first the <HI>Procuring Efficient,</HI> the other the <HI>Formal Cause.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI>; We understand not by this Justification by Christ, barely the <HI>Good Works,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Expl. 4.</NOTE> <HI>even as wrought by the Spirit of Christ</HI>; for they, as <HI>Protestants</HI> truly af∣firm, are rather an effect of Justification than the Cause of it:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Forma∣tion of Christ in us begets good Works.</NOTE> But we understand the <HI>Formation of Christ in us, Christ born and brought forth in us</HI>; from which, Good Works as naturally proceed, as Fruit from a fruitful Tree. It is this <HI>Inward Birth in us, bringing forth Righteousness and Holiness in us, that doth</HI> Justifie <HI>us</HI>; which, having removed and done away the contray nature and spirit, that did bear Rule, and bring Condemnation, now is in dominion over all <HI>in</HI> our Hearts. Those then that come to know <HI>Christ</HI> thus formed in them, do enjoy him wholly and undivided, who is <HI>the LORD our RIGHTEOUSNESS,</HI> Jer. 23.6. This is to be
<PB N="206" REF="003129_0110_0FF004F05B4527C8"/>
Clothed with <HI>Christ,</HI> and to have put him on, whom <HI>God</HI> therefore truly accounted Righteous and Just. This is so far from being the Doctrine of <HI>Papists,</HI> that as the generality of them do not understand it; so the Learned among them oppose it, and dispute against it, and particularly <HI>Bellarmine.</HI> Thus then, as I may say, the Formal Cause of Justification is not the Works, to speak properly, they being but an Effect of it; but this Inward Birth, this <HI>Jesus</HI> brought forth in the Heart: Who is the Well-beloved, whom the Father cannot but accept, and all those, who thus are sprinkled with the <HI>Blood of Jesus,</HI> and washed with it. By this also comes that Communication of the Goods of Christ unto us, <HI>by which we come to be made Partakers of the Divine Na∣ture,</HI> as saith <HI>Peter,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.4. and are made one with him, as the Branches with the Vine, and have a title and right to what he hath done and suffered for us:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ's O∣bedience, Righteous∣ness, Death and Suffer∣ings, are ours.</NOTE> So that his Obedience becomes ours, his Righteousness ours, his Death and Sufferings ours. And by this Nearness we come to have a sense of his Sufferings, and to suffer with his Seed, that yet lies pressed and crucified in the Hearts of the Un∣godly; and so travel with it, and for its Redemp∣tion, and for the Rpentance of those Souls, that in it are Crucifying as yet the Lord of Glory. Even as the Apostle <HI>Paul, who by his Sufferings</HI> is said to <HI>fill up that which is behind of the Afflictions of Christ for his Body, which is the Church:</HI> Tho' this be a Mystery, sealed up from all the Wise Men, that are yet ig∣norant of this Seed in themselves, and oppose it; nevertheless some <HI>Protestants</HI> speak of this Justifica∣tion by <HI>Christ</HI> inwardly put on; as shall hereafter be recited in its place.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Expl. 5.</NOTE><HI>Lastly</HI>; Tho' we place Remission of Sins in the <HI>Righteousness and Obedience of Christ, performed by him in the Flesh,</HI> as to what pertains to the remote pro∣curing Cause; and that we hold our selves <HI>formally justified by Christ Jesus formed and brought forth in

us:</HI> Yet can we not (as some <HI>Protestants</HI> have un∣warily done) <HI>Exclude</HI> Works <HI>from Justification.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Good Works are not ex∣cluded Ju∣stification.</NOTE> For tho' properly we are not Justified <HI>for them,</HI> yet are we Justified <HI>in them</HI>; and they are necessary, even as <HI>Causa sine qua non,</HI> i. e. <HI>The Cause without which none are Justified.</HI> For the denying of this, as it is contrary to the Scriptures Testimony; so it hath brought a-great Scandal to the Protestant Religion, opened the Mouths of <HI>Papists,</HI> and made many too secure, while they have believed to be Justified without Good Works. Moreover, tho' it be not so safe to say, <HI>They are Meritorious</HI>; yet seeing they are Rewarded, many of those called the <HI>Fathers,</HI> have not spared to use the word [<HI>Merit</HI>] which some of us have perhaps also done, in a qualified sence; but no ways to infer the <HI>Popish Abuses</HI> above∣mentioned. And <HI>lastly,</HI> if we had that Notion of Good Works, which most <HI>Protestants</HI> have, we could freely agree to make them not only not necessary, but reject them as hurtful: viz. <HI>That the best Works, even of the</HI> Saints, <HI>are defiled and polluted.</HI> For tho' we judge so of the best Works performed by Man, endeavouring a Conformity to the outward Law, by his own Strength, and in his own Will; yet we believe, that such <HI>Works</HI> as naturally proceed from this Spiritual Birth, and Formation of Christ in us, are <HI>Pure</HI> and <HI>Holy,</HI> even as the <HI>Root</HI> from which they come; and therefore God Accepts them, justifies us in them, and Rewards us for them, of his own <HI>Free-Grace.</HI> The State of the Controversie being thus stated, these following <HI>Positions</HI> do hence-from arise, in the next place to be proved.</P>
<P N="4">§. IV. First; <HI>That the Obedience, Sufferings,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Position 1.</NOTE> <HI>and Death of Christ, is that, by which the Soul obtains</HI> Re∣mission of Sins, <HI>and is the procuring Cause of that</HI> Grace, <HI>by whose Inward Workings</HI> Christ <HI>comes to be formed inwardly, and the</HI> Soul <HI>to be made conformable unto him, and so just and justified.</HI> And that therefore, in respect of this Capacity and Offer of Grace, <HI>God</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="003129_0111_0FF004F1F9B4ACB0"/>
is said to be <HI>Reconciled</HI>; not as if he were actually <HI>Reconciled,</HI> or did actually Justifie, or account any Just, so long as they remain in their Sins, really impure and unjust.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Position 2.</NOTE>Secondly; <HI>That it is by this Inward Birth of Christ in Man, that Man is made just, and therefore so ac∣counted by God</HI>: Wherefore, to be plain, we are thereby and not till that be brought forth in us, <HI>formally</HI> (if we must use that word) <HI>Justified</HI> in the sight of God; because Justification is both more properly ard frequently in Scripture, taken in its proper signification, for making one Just, and not reputing one meerly such, and is all one with <HI>San∣ctification.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Position 3.</NOTE>Thirdly; That since Good Works as naturally fol∣low from this Birth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good Works are <HI>Causa sine qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> non</HI>—of Justifica∣tion.</NOTE> as heat from Fire; therefore are they of <HI>Absolute Necessity</HI> to Justification, as <HI>Causa sine qua non,</HI> i. e. tho' not as the Cause <HI>for which</HI>; yet as that <HI>in which</HI> we are and without which we cannot be Justified. And tho' they be not <HI>Me∣ritorious,</HI> and draw no debt upon God, yet he can∣not but accept and reward them; for it is con∣trary to his Nature to deny his own; since they may be perfect in their kind, as proceeding from a pure, holy Birth and Root. Wherefore their Judgment is false, and against the Truth, that say, <HI>That the holiest Works of the</HI> Saints <HI>are defiled and sinful in the sight of God</HI>: For these Good Works are not the Works of the Law, excluded by the Apostle from Justification.</P>
<P N="5"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Position</HI> 1.</NOTE>§. V. As to the first, I prove it from <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.25. <HI>Whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood,</HI> <MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="I"/> <HI>to declare his Righteousness for the</HI> Remission of Sins <HI>that are past,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Effica∣cy of Christ's Death to redeem Man out of Evil.</NOTE> <HI>through the forbearance of God.</HI> Here the Apostle holds forth the Extent and Efficacy of <HI>Christ's Death,</HI> shewing, that thereby, and by Faith therein, Remission of Sins that are past is obtained; as being that, wherein the For∣bearance of God is exercised towards Mankind.
<PB N="209" REF="003129_0111_0FF004F1F9B4ACB0"/>
So that, tho' Men, for the Sins they daily commit, deserve Eternal Death, and that the Wrath of God should lay hold upon them; yet by Vertue of that most satisfactory Sacrifice of <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> the Grace and Seed of God moves in love towards them, du∣ring the Day of their Visitation; yet not so as not to strike against the Evil (for that must be burned up and destroyed) but to redeem Man out of the Evil.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="II"/> <HI>Secondly</HI>; If God were perfectly Reconciled with Men, and did esteem them Just, while they are actually Unjust, and do continue in their Sins; then should God have no Controversie with them: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I do not only speak con∣cerning Men before Con∣version, who afterwards are Converted, whom yet some of our Antagonists called <HI>Antinomians,</HI> do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver were Justified from the Begin∣ning; but also touching those, who (according to the common Opinion of <HI>Protestants</HI>) have been Converted: Whom albeit they confess, they persist always in some <HI>Misdeeds,</HI> and sometimes in <HI>haino<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Sins,</HI> as is manifest in <HI>Da∣vid</HI>'s Adultery and Mur∣der; yet they assert to be perfectly and wholly Justi∣fied.</NOTE> How comes he then so often to Complain, and to Expostulate so much throughout the whole Scripture with such, as our Adversaries confess to be Justified; telling them, <HI>That their</HI> Sins <HI>se∣parate betwixt him and them?</HI> Isai. 59.2. For where there is a perfect and full Reconcilation, there is no Separation. Yea, from this Doctrine it necessarily follows, either that such for whom <HI>Christ</HI> died, and whom he hath thus Reconciled, never Sin; or that, when they do so, they are still Reconciled, and their Sins make not the least Separa∣tion from God; yea, that they are Justified in their Sins. From whence also would follow this abo∣minable Consequence, that the good Works and greatest Sins of such, are alike in the sight of God; seeing neither the one serves to Justifie them, nor the other to break their Reconcilation; which oc∣casions great Security, and opens a door to every lewd Practice.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pr.</HI> III.</NOTE> This would make void the whole Pra∣ctical Doctrine of the Gospel, and make Faith it self needless. For if Faith and Repentance, and the other Conditions called for throughout the Gos∣pel,
<PB N="210" REF="003129_0112_0FF004F402456BC0"/>
be a Qualification upon our part necessary to be performed; then before this be performed by us, we are either fully Reconciled to God, or put in a capacity of being Reconciled to God, he being ready to Reconcile and Justifie us, as these Condi∣tions are performed: Which latter, if granted, is according to the Truth we profess. And if we are already perfectly Reconciled and Justified, be∣fore these Conditions are performed, (which Con∣ditions are of that Nature, that they cannot be performed at one time, but are to be done all ones Life-time) then can they not be said to be absolutely needful: Which is contrary to the very express Testimony of Scripture, which is acknow∣ledged by all <HI>Christians: For without Faith it is impossible to please God:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb 11.6. John 3.18. Luke 13.3. Rom. 8.13.</NOTE> <HI>They that believe not, are condemn'd al∣ready, because they believe not in the</HI> Only Begotten Son of God: <HI>Except ye Repent, ye cannot be saved: For if ye live after the Flesh, ye shall die.</HI> And of those that were Converted: <HI>I will remove your Candlestick from you,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apoc. 2.5.</NOTE> <HI>unless ye Repent.</HI> Should I mention all the Scrip∣tures that positively and evidently prove this, I might transcribe much of all the Doctrinal Part of the <HI>Bible.</HI> For since Christ said, <HI>It is Finished,</HI> and did finish his Work Sixteen Hundred Years ago, and upwards; if he so fully perfected Redemption then, and did actually Reconcile every one, that is to be saved;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Door of Mercy opened by Christ, upon Repen∣tance.</NOTE> not simply opening a Door of Mercy for them, offering the Sacrifice of his Body, by which they may obtain Remission of their Sins, when they Repent, and communicating unto them a mea∣sure of his Grace, by which they may see their Sins, and be able to Repent; but really make them to be reputed as Just,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Anti∣nomians</HI> Opinion of Reconcili∣ation and Justifica∣tion.</NOTE> either before they believe (as say the <HI>Antinomians</HI>) or after they have assented to the Truth of the History of Christ, or are sprinkled with the Baptism of Water, while nevertheless they are actully Unjust, so that no part of their Redemption is to be wrought by him now, as to
<PB N="211" REF="003129_0112_0FF004F402456BC0"/>
their Reconciliation &amp; Justification; then the whole Doctrinal Part of the <HI>Bible</HI> is useless, and of no pro∣fit: In vain were the Apostles sent forth to preach Repentance and Remission of Sins; and in vain do all the Preachers bestow their <HI>Labour,</HI> spend their <HI>Lungs,</HI> and give forth <HI>Writings</HI>; yea, much more in vain do the People spend their <HI>Money,</HI> which they give them for Preaching; seeing it is all but <HI>Actum agere,</HI> but a vain and ineffectual Essay, to do that which is al∣ready perfectly done without them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="IV"/> But <HI>lastly</HI>; To pretermit their Humane Labours as not worth the disputing, whether they be need∣ful or not, since (as we shall hereafter shew) them∣selves confess, the <HI>best</HI> of them is <HI>sinful</HI>; this also makes void the present Intercession of Christ for Men. What shall become of that great Article of Faith, by which we affirm, <HI>That he sits at the Right Hand of God, daily making Intercession for us;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ's daily mak∣ing Inter∣cession for us.</NOTE> <HI>and for which end the</HI> Spirit <HI>it self maketh Intercession for us, with</HI> Groanings, <HI>which cannot be uttered</HI>? For Christ maketh not Intercession for those, that are not in a Possibility of Salvation; that is absurd. Our Ad∣versaries will not admit that he prayed for the World at all; and to pray for those, that are already Reconciled, and perfectly Justified, is to no pur∣pose: To pray for Remission of Sins, is yet more needless, if all be remitted, past, present, and to come. Indeed there is not any solid Solving of this, but by acknowledging, according to the <HI>Truth,</HI> That Christ by his Death removed the Wrath of God, so far as to obtain Remission of Sins for as many as receive that <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> that he com∣municates unto them, and hath purchased for them by his Blood: Which, as they believe in, they come to know Remission of Sins past, and Power to save them from Sin, and to wipe it away, so often as they may fall into it by unwatchfulness or weakness, if applying themselves to this Grace, they truly Repent. For <HI>to as many as receive him,
<PB N="212" REF="003129_0113_0FF004F766EA14F8"/>
he gives Power to become the Sons of God</HI>: So none are Sons, none are Justified, none Reconciled, until they thus receive him in that little <HI>Seed</HI> in their Hearts: <HI>And Life Eternal is offered to those, who by patient continuance in well doing, seek for Glory, Honour, and Immortality: For if the Righteous Man depart from his Righteousness, his Righteousness shall be remembred no more.</HI> And therefore, on the other part, none are longer Sons of God, and Justified, than they pa∣tiently continue in Righteousness and Well doing. And therefore Christ lives always making Inter∣cession, during the Day of every Man's Visitation, that they may be Converted And when Men are in some measure Converted, he makes Intercession, that they may continue, and go on, and not faint, nor go back again. Much more might be said to confirm this Truth; but I go on to take notice of the common Objections against it, which are the Arguments made use of to propagate the Errors contrary to it.</P>
<P N="6">§. VI. The <HI>first</HI> and <HI>chief</HI> is drawn from that Say∣ing of the Apostle before mentioned, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.18, 19. <HI>God hath reconciled us to himself by</HI> Jesus Christ: <HI>God was in Christ reconciling the World unto himself; not imputing their Trespasses unto them.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="1"/> From hence they seek to infer, <HI>That Christ fully per∣fected the Work of Reconciliation, while he was on Earth.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; If by (<HI>Reconciliation</HI>) be understood the Removing of Wrath, and the Purchase of that Grace, by which we may come to be Reconciled, we agree to it; but that that place speaks no more, appears from the place it self: For when the Apo∣stle speaks in the <HI>Perfect Time,</HI> saying, <HI>He hath Re∣conciled us,</HI> he speaks of himself and the Saints; who having received the Grace of God, purchased by Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The diffe∣rence be∣tween <HI>Re∣conciled</HI> to Christ, and <HI>Reconcil∣ing.</HI></NOTE> were through Faith in him actually Re∣conciled. But as to the <HI>World,</HI> he saith (<HI>Reconciling</HI>) not (<HI>Reconciled</HI>) which <HI>Reconciling,</HI> tho' it denotes a time somewhat past; yet it is by the <HI>Imperfect
<PB N="213" REF="003129_0113_0FF004F766EA14F8"/>
Time,</HI> denoting, that the thing begun was not per∣fected. For this Work <HI>Christ</HI> began towards All, in the Days of his Flesh, yea, and long before; for <HI>He was the mediator from the Beginning,</HI> and <HI>the Lamb slain from the Foundation of the World:</HI> But in his Flesh, after he had perfectly fulfilled the Law, and the righteousness thereof, and rent the Vail, and made way for the more clear and universal Reve∣lation of the Gospel to All, both <HI>Jew</HI> and <HI>Gentile</HI>; he <HI>gave up himself a most satisfactory Sacrifice for Sin</HI>; which becomes effectual to as many as receive him in his inward Appearance, in his <HI>Light</HI> in the heart. Again, This very place sheweth, that no other Re∣conciliation is intended, but the Opening of a Door of Mercy, upon God's part, and a Removing of Wrath for Sins that are past; so as Men, notwithstanding their Sins, are stated in a capacity of Salvation: For the Apostle in the folowing Verse, saith, <HI>Now then, we are Ambassadors for Christ, as tho' God did be∣seech you by us; we pray you, in Christ's flead, be ye Re∣conciled to God.</HI> For if their Reconciliation had already been perfectly accomplished, what need any Intreat∣ing then to be Reconciled? Ambassadors are not sent after a peace already perfected, and Reconciliation made, to intreat for a Reconciliation; for that im∣plies a manifest Contradiction.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>; They object, Verse 21. of the same Chapter, <HI>For he hath made him to be</HI> Sin <HI>for us, who knew no</HI> Sin, <HI>that we might be made the</HI> Righteousness of God <HI>in him.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="2"/> From whence they argue; <HI>That as our</HI> Sin <HI>is im¦puted to Christ, who had no</HI> Sin; <HI>so Christ's</HI> Righteousness <HI>is imputed to us, without our being Righteous.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> But this Interpretation is easily rejected; for tho' <HI>Christ bare our Sins,</HI> and <HI>suffered for us,</HI> and was among Men, <HI>accounted a Sinner,</HI> and <HI>numbred among Transgressors</HI>; yet that God reputed him a Sinner, is no where proved. For it is said, <HI>He was found before him Holy, Harmless, and</HI> Undefiled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 7.26. 1 Pet. 2.22.</NOTE> <HI>neither was
<PB N="214" REF="003129_0114_0FF004F9DF8628F0"/>
there found any Guile in his Mouth.</HI> That we de∣served these things, and much more for our Sins, which he indured in Obedience to the Father, and according to his Counsel, is true; but that ever God reputed him a <HI>Sinner,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Men's I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Righteous∣ness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> refu∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> is denied: Neither did he ever die, that we should be reputed Righteous; tho' no more really such, than he was a Sinner (as hereafter appears.) For indeed, if this Argument hold, it might be stretched to that length, as to become very pleasing to wicked Men, that love to abide in their Sins: For if we be made <HI>Righteous, as Christ was made a</HI> Sinner, <HI>meerly by imputation, then as there was no</HI> Sin, <HI>not in the least in Christ</HI>; so it would follow, <HI>that there needed no more</HI> Righteousness, <HI>no more</HI> Holiness, <HI>no more inward</HI> Sactification <HI>in us, than there was</HI> Sin <HI>in him.</HI> So then by his (<HI>being made</HI> Sin <HI>for us)</HI> must be understood, his Suffering for our Sins, that we might be made Partakers of the Grace purchased by him; by the Workings whereof we are made the Righteousness of God in him. For that the Apostle understood here a be∣ing made really Righteous, and not meerly a being reputed such, appears by what follows, seeing in <HI>vers.</HI> 14, 15, 16. of the following Chapter, he argues largely against any supposed <HI>Agreement of Light and Darkness, Righteousness and Unrighteousness</HI>; which must needs be admitted, if Men are to be reckon'd Ingrafted in Christ, and real Members of him, meerly by an Imputative Righteousness, wholly without them, while they themselves are actually Unrighteous. And indeed, it may be thought strange, how some Men have made this so Funda∣mental an Article of their Faith, which is so con∣trary to the whole strain of the Gospel: A thing, Christ in none of all his Sermons and Gracious Speeches ever willed any to rely upon; always recommending to us Works, as Instrumental in our Justification. And the more 'tis to be admired at, because that Sentence or Term (so frequently in their Mouths,
<PB N="215" REF="003129_0114_0FF004F9DF8628F0"/>
and so often pressed by them, as the very <HI>Basis</HI> of their Hope and Confidence) to wit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ's Im∣puted Righteous∣ness not found in all the Bible.</NOTE> <HI>The Imputed Righteousness of Christ,</HI> is not to be found in all the <HI>Bible,</HI> at least as to my Observation. Thus have I pass'd through the first part, and that the more briefly, because many, who assert this Justification by bare Imputation, do nevertheless confess, That even the Elect are not Justified, until they be Con∣verted; that is, not until this Imputative Justifica∣tion he apply'd to them by the Spirit.</P>
<P N="7">§. VII. I come then to the Second thing pro∣posed by me, which is;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Posit. II.</NOTE> <HI>That it is by this inward Birth, or Christ formed within,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">By Christ form'd within, we are Justi∣fied.</NOTE> <HI>that we are</HI> (so to speak) formally Justified <HI>in the sight of God.</HI> I sup∣pose, I have said enough already to demonstrate, how much we ascribe to the <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Sufferings</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> as that, whereby Satisfaction is made to the Justice of God, Remission of Sins obtained, and this Grace and Seed purchased; by and from which this Birth proceeds. The thing now to be proved is, <HI>That by</HI> Christ Jesus <HI>formed in us, we are justifyed, or made just.</HI> Let it be marked, I use Justification in this sense upon this occasion.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="I"/> <HI>First</HI> then, I prove this by that of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Cor. 6.11. <HI>And such were some of you; but ye are Washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are Justi∣fied in the Name of the</HI> Lord Jesus, <HI>and by the</HI> Spirit <HI>of our God.</HI> First, This (<HI>Justified</HI>) here understood,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Justified,</HI> i. e.

For the Apostle shewing them in the preceding Verses, how the <HI>Unrighte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s cannot inherit the Kingdom of God</HI>; and descending to the several Species of Wick∣edness, subsumes, <HI>That they were sometimes such, but now are not any more such.</HI> Wherefore, as they are now Washed and Sanctified, so are they Justified:
<PB N="216" REF="003129_0115_0FF004FB8A4380A0"/>
For if this Justification were not Real, then it might be alledged, that the <HI>Corinthians</HI> had not forsaken these Evils, but tho' they still continued in them, were notwitwstanding Justified: Which as in it self it is most absurd, so it luculently over∣turneth the very Import and Intent of the place; as if the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> turning Christians, had not wrought any real Change in them; but had only been a Belief of some barren Notions, which had wrought no alteration in their Affections, Will, or Manner of Life. For my own part, I neither see any thing, nor could ever yet hear or read any thing, that with any colour of Reason did evince (<HI>Justified)</HI> in this place to be understood any other ways, than in its own proper and genuine Inter∣pretation of being made Just. And for the more clear understanding hereof, let it be considered, that this word (<HI>Justifie</HI>) is derived either from the Substantive <HI>Justice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Deri∣vation of the Word <HI>Justifie</HI> considered.</NOTE> or the Adjective <HI>just:</HI> Both which words import the Substantive, that true and real <HI>Vertue in the Soul,</HI> as it is in it self, to wit, it signifies <HI>really,</HI> and not <HI>suppositively,</HI> that Excellent Quality expressed and understood among Men by the word (<HI>Justice</HI>;) and the Adjective <HI>(just)</HI> as applied, signifies a Man or Woman, who is Just, that is, in whom this Quality of Justice is stated: For it would not only be great Impropriety, but also manifest Falsity, to call a Man Just, meerly by <HI>supposition</HI>; especially if he were really Unjust. Now this word (<HI>Justifie</HI>) formed from <HI>Justice,</HI> or <HI>just,</HI> doth beyond all que∣stion signifie a <HI>making just</HI>; it being nothing else, but a Composition of the Verb <HI>facio,</HI> and the Ad∣jective <HI>justus,</HI> which is nothing else than thus, <HI>justifico,</HI> i. e. <HI>Justum facio,</HI> I make Just; and <HI>(Justified</HI>) of <HI>justus</HI> and <HI>fio,</HI> as <HI>justus fio,</HI> I become. Just and <HI>justifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atus,</HI> i. e. <HI>justus factus,</HI> I am made Just. Thus also is it with Verbs of this kind, as <HI>sanctifico,</HI> from <HI>sanctus</HI> holy, and <HI>facio; honorifico,</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="003129_0115_0FF004FB8A4380A0"/>
from <HI>honor</HI> and <HI>facio; sacrifico</HI> from <HI>sacer</HI> and <HI>facio:</HI> All which are still understood of the Subject really and truly endued with that Vertue and Quality, from which the Verb is derived. Therefore as none are said to be Sanctified,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Justifi'd none are, while they actually remain Un∣just.</NOTE> that are really Un∣holy, while they are such; so neither can any be truly said to be Justified, while they actually re∣main Unjust. Only this Verb <HI>justify,</HI> hath, in a Metaphorical and Figurative sence, been other∣wise taken, to wit, in a <HI>Law</HI> sense; as when a Man really guilty of a Crime, is freed from that Punishment of his Sin, he is said to be <HI>justifyed</HI>; that is, put in the place, as if he were <HI>just.</HI> For this use of the word, hath proceeded from the true supposition, <HI>That none ought to be acquitted, but the Innocent.</HI> Hence also that manner of speaking, <HI>I will justify such a Man,</HI> or <HI>I will justify this or that,</HI> is used from the supposition, that the Person and Thing is really justifiable: And where there is an Error and Abuse in the Matter, so far there is also in the Expression.</P>
<P>This is so manifest and apparent, that <HI>Paraeus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Paraeus</HI> de <HI>Just.</HI> cont.

said, then must <HI>good Works</HI> also; unless our Adver∣saries can shew us a <HI>holy Man</HI> without <HI>good Works.</HI> But moreover, (<HI>Justified</HI>) in this Figurative sense is used for <HI>Approved</HI>; and indeed for the most part, if not always in Scripture, when the word (<HI>Justify</HI>) is used, it is taken in the worst part; that is, that as the use of the word that way is an Usurpation, so it is spoken of such as usurp the thing to them∣selves, while it properly doth not belong unto them; as will appear to those that will be at the pains to Examine these places, <HI>Exod.</HI> 23.7. <HI>Joh</HI> 9.20. &amp; 27.5. <HI>Prov.</HI> 17.15. <HI>Isai.</HI> 5.23. <HI>Jer.</HI> 3.11. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.51, 52. <HI>Luke</HI> 10.29. &amp; 16.15. which are all spoken of Men <HI>justifying the Wicked,</HI> or of <HI>Wicked Men justify∣ing themselves</HI>; that is, approving themselves in their Wickedness. If it be at any time in this signification taken in good part, it is very seldom, and that so obvious and plain by the Context, as leaves no scruple. But the Question is not so much of the use of the <HI>word,</HI> where it is passingly or oc∣casionally used, as where the very Doctrine of Ju∣stification is handled. Where indeed to mistake it, <HI>viz.</HI> in its proper place, so as to content our selves with an Imaginary Justification, while God requires a <HI>Real,</HI> is of most dangerous Consequence. For the Disquisition of which, let it be considered, that in all these places to the <HI>Romans, Corinthians, Galatians,</HI> and elswhere, where the Apostle handles this Theam, the word may be taken in its own proper Significa∣tion without any absurdity. As, where it is often asserted in the above-mentioned Epistles to the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> and <HI>Galatians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Justified,</HI> its proper Significa∣tion.</NOTE> That <HI>a Man cannot be justified by the Law of</HI> Moses, <HI>nor by the Works of the Law</HI>: There is no absurdity nor danger in understanding it, according to its own proper signification, to wit, that a Man cannot be made <HI>just</HI> by the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Moses</HI>; seeing this so well agrees with that Saying of the same Apostle, That <HI>the Law makes nothing perfect.</HI> And also where it is said, <HI>We are justifyed
<PB N="219" REF="003129_0116_0FF004FEE0FCC748"/>
by Faith,</HI> it may be very well understood of being <HI>made just</HI>; seeing it is also said, That <HI>Faith purifys the Heart</HI>; and no doubt the <HI>Pure in heart</HI> are Just; and <HI>the</HI> Just <HI>live by Faith.</HI> Again, where it is said, <HI>We are</HI> justified <HI>by</HI> Grace, <HI>We are</HI> justified <HI>by</HI> Christ, <HI>We are</HI> justfied <HI>by the</HI> Spirit; it is no ways absurd to understand it of being <HI>made Just,</HI> seeing by his Spirit and Grace he doth make Men <HI>just.</HI> But to understand it universally, the other way, meerly for <HI>Acceptance</HI> and <HI>Imputation,</HI> would infer great Absurdities, as may be proved at large; but be∣cause I judged it would be acknowledged, I for∣bear at present for Brevity's sake. But further, in the most weighty places, where this word <HI>Justify</HI> is used in Scripture, with an immediate relation to the Doctrine of Justification,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Justificati∣tion</HI> signi∣fys a mak∣ing <HI>Just.</HI></NOTE> our Adversaries must needs aknowledge it to be understood of <HI>making Just,</HI> and not barely in the Legal Acceptation: As first, in that of 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.11. <HI>But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified,</HI> as I before have proved; which also many Protestants are forced to acknowledge.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thysius <HI>Disp. de</HI> Just. <HI>Thes.</HI> 3.</NOTE> <HI>Neither diffide we</HI> (saith <HI>Thysius) because of the most great and strict Connexion, that</HI> Justification <HI>doth sometimes seem also to compre∣hend</HI> Sanctification, <HI>as a Consequence, as in</HI> Rom. 8.30.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="II"/> <HI>Secondly</HI>; In that excellent Saying of the Apostle, so much observed, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.30. <HI>Whom he called, them he also</HI> Justified; <HI>and whom he</HI> Justified, <HI>them he also glo∣rified:</HI> This is commonly called the <HI>Golden Chain,</HI> as being acknowledged to comprehend the Method and Order of Salvation. And therefore, if (<HI>Justi∣fied</HI>) were not understood here in its proper signi∣fication, of being <HI>made just,</HI> Sanctification would be excluded out of this Chain. And truly it is very worthy of Observation, that the Apostle, in this succinct and compendious Account, makes the word <HI>(Justified)</HI> to comprehend all betwixt Calling and Glorifying;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Righteous∣ness the on∣ly Medium by which from our Calling we pass to Glo∣rification.</NOTE> thereby clearly insinuating, that the be∣ing really <HI>Righteous,</HI> is that only <HI>Medium,</HI> by which from our Calling we pass to Glorification.

In his Death is beheld the satisfaction for Sin; in his Resurrection, the Gift of the Holy Spirit, by which our</HI> Justification <HI>is</HI> perfected. And again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idem. lib. <HI>3.</HI> Reg. cap. <HI>9.</HI> v <HI>4.</HI> p. <HI>681.</HI></NOTE> the same Man saith elsewhere; <HI>Both these kinds of Righteousness are therefore contained in</HI> Justification, <HI>neither can the one be separate from the other. So that in the</HI> Definition of Justification, <HI>the Merit of the Blood of Christ is included, both with the Remission of</HI> Sins, <HI>and with the</HI> Gift of the Holy Spirit of Justification <HI>and Regeneration.

And this is that Order and Method of Salvation, held forth by the Apo∣stle in that Divine Saving, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.10. <HI>For if when we were Enemies, we were</HI> reconciled to God <HI>by the Death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his Life.</HI> For the Apostle first holding forth the Reconciliation wrought by the Death of Christ, wherein God is near to receive and redeem Man, holds forth his Salvation and Justification to be by the <HI>Life of Jesus.</HI> Now that this <HI>Life</HI> is an Inward, Spiritual Thing, revealed in the Soul, where∣by it is renewed and brought forth out of <HI>Death,</HI> where it naturally has been by the <HI>Fall,</HI> and so Quickned and made Alive unto God, the same Apostle shews, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.5. <HI>Even when we were dead in sins and trespasses, he hath quickned us together in Christ (by whose</HI> Grace <HI>ye are saved) and hath raised us up together.</HI> Now, this none will deny to be the Inward Work of Renovation; and therefore the Apostle gives that reason of their being <HI>saved by Grace</HI>; which is the Inward Vertue, and power of Christ in the Soul: But of this place more here∣after. Of the Revelation of this <HI>Inward Life,</HI> the Apostle also speaketh, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.10. <HI>That the</HI> Life <HI>also of</HI> Jesus <HI>might be made manifest in our Bodies</HI>; and verse 11. <HI>That the</HI> Life <HI>also of</HI> Jesus <HI>might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.</HI> Now this inward Life of Jesus is that, <HI>whereby,</HI> as is before observed, he said, <HI>We are saved.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="II"/> Secondly; <HI>That it is by this Revelation of</HI> Jesus Christ, <HI>and the new Creation in us, that we are justi∣fyed,</HI> doth evidently appear from that Excellent Saying of the Apostle, included in the Proposition it self, <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.5. <HI>According to his mercy he hath saved us, by the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost,</HI> &amp;c. Now that, whereby we are saved,

that we are also no doubt justified by; which words are in this respect synonymous.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Imme∣diate Cause of <HI>Justifi∣cation</HI> is the Inward work of <HI>Regenera∣tion.</HI></NOTE> Here the Apostle clearly ascribes the <HI>immediate</HI> Cause of Justification to this Inward Work of Regeneration, which is Jesus Christ <HI>revealed</HI> in the Soul, as being that, which formally states us in a capacity of being Reconciled with God; the Washing of Regenera∣tion, being that inward Power and Vertue, whereby the Soul is cleansed, and clothed with the Righte∣ousness of Christ, so as to be made fit to appear be∣fore God.</P>
<P>Thirdly;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pr.</HI> III.</NOTE> This Doctrine is manifest from 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5. <HI>Examine your own selves, whether ye be in the Faith; prove your own selves, Know ye not your own selves, how that</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>is in you, except ye be Reprobates? First,</HI> It appears here how earnest the Apostle was, that they should know <HI>Christ in them</HI>; so that he presses this Exhortation upon them, and Inculcates it three times. <HI>Secondly,</HI> He makes the cause of Reprobation, or not Justification,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cause of <HI>Repro∣bation</HI> is Christ not known by inward <HI>Re∣velation.</HI></NOTE> the want of Christ thus revealed and known in the Soul: Whereby it necessarily follows, by the Rule of Contraries, where the Party is alike (as in this case it is evident) that, where Christ is inwardly known, there the Persons subjected to him are ap∣proved and Justified. For there can be nothing more plain than this, That if we must know <HI>Christ in us,</HI> except we be Reprobates, or unjustified Per∣sons; if we know him <HI>in us,</HI> we are not Repro∣bates, and consequently Justified Ones. Like unto this is that other saying of the same Apostle, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.19. <HI>My little Children, of whom I travel in Birth again, until Christ be formed in you</HI>; and therefore the Apostle terms this, <HI>Christ within, the Hope of Glory,</HI> Col. 1.27, 28. Now that which is the Hope of Glory, can be no other, than that which we <HI>im∣mediately</HI> and <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st nearly</HI> rely upon for our Justifi∣cation, and that whereby we are really and truly made Just. And as we do not hereby deny, but
<PB N="226" REF="003129_0120_0FF0050ACEC65940"/>
the Original and Fundamental Cause of our Justi∣fication is, the Love of God manifested in the Ap∣pearance of Jesus Christ in the Flesh; who by his Life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ by his Death and Suffer∣ings has open'd a way for our Recon∣ciliation.</NOTE> Death, Sufferings and Obedience, made a way for our Reconciliation, and became a Sacrifice for the Remission of Sins that are past, and pur∣chased unto us this Seed and Grace, from which this Birth arises, and in which Jesus Christ is inwardly received, formed, and brought forth in us, in his own pure and holy Image of Righteousness; by which our Souls live unto God, and are clothed with him, and have put him on, even as the Scrip∣ture speaks, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.23, 24. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.27. We stand Justified and Saved in and by him, and by his Spi∣rit and Grace. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.11. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.7. So again, <HI>Reciprocally,</HI> we are hereby made partakers of the fulness of his Merits and his cleansing Blood is near, to wash away every Sin and Infirmity, and to heal all our Backslidings, as often as we turn to∣wards him by unfeigned Repentance, and become renewed by the Spirit. Those then, that find him thus raised, and ruling in them, have a true ground of Hope to beleive that they are justified by his Blood. But let not any deceive themselves, so as to foster themselves in a vain Hope and Confidence; that by the Death and sufferings of Christ they are Justified, so long as <HI>Sin lies at their door,</HI> Gen. 4.7. Iniquity prevails, and they remain yet unrenewed and unregenerate; lest it be said unto them, <HI>I know you not.</HI> Let that saying of Christ be remember'd, <HI>Not every one, that saith Lord, Lord, shall enter, but he that doth the Will of my Father,</HI> Mat. 7.21. To which let these Excellent Sayings of the Beloved Disciple be added; <HI>Little Children, let no Man de∣ceive you, he that doth Righteousness is Righteous, even as he is Righteous. He that Committeth Sin is of the Devil; because if our Heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things,</HI> 1 John 3.7. and 20.</P>

<P>Many famous Protestants bear witness to this In∣ward Justification by Christ, inwardly revealed and formed in Man. As, 1. <HI>M. Borhaeus</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Borhaeus <HI>in</HI> Gen. <HI>p.</HI> 162.</NOTE>
<Q>In the Im∣putation (saith he) wherein Christ is ascribed and imputed to Believers for Righteousness, the Merit of his Blood, and the Holy Ghost given unto us by Vertue of his Merits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Testi∣monies of Famous Protestants of Inward Justifica∣tion.</NOTE> are equally in∣cluded. And so it shall be confessed, <HI>That Christ is our Righteousness,</HI> as well from his Merit, Satis∣faction, and Remission of Sins obtained by him, as from the Gifts of the Spirit of Righteousness. And if we do this, we shall consider the whole Christ, proposed to us for our Salvation, and not any single part of him. The same Man, p. 169. In our Justification then Christ is consider∣ed, who breathes and lives in us, to wit, by his Spirit put on by us; concerning which putting on, the Apostle saith, <HI>Ye have put on Christ.</HI> And again, p. 171. We endeavour to treat in Justi∣fication, not of part of Christ, but him wholly, in so far as he is our Righteousness every way.</Q>
And a little after:
<Q>As then blessed <HI>Paul,</HI> in our Justification, when he saith, <HI>Whom he Justified, them he Glorified,</HI> comprehends all things which pertains to our being Reconciled to God the Father, and our Renewing, which fits us for at∣taining unto Glory, such as Faith, Righteousness, Christ, and the Gift of Righteousness Exhibited by him, whereby we are Regenerated, to the fulfilling of the Justification which the Law re∣quires: So we also will have all things compre∣hended in this cause, which are contained in the recovery of Righteousness and Innocency. And p. 181.</Q>
<Q>The Form (saith he) of our Justification is the Divine Righteousness it self, by which we are formed Just and Good. This is Jesus Christ, who is esteem'd our Righteousness, partly from the forgiveness of Sins, and partly from the re∣newing and the restoring of that Integrity, which
<PB N="228" REF="003129_0121_0FF0050C6808A458"/>
was lost by the fault of the first <HI>Adam:</HI> So that this New and Heavenly <HI>Adam</HI> being put on by us, (of which the Apostle saith, <HI>Ye have put on Christ</HI>) ye have put him on, I say, as the Form. so the Righteousness, Wisdom, and Life of God.</Q>

<P N="10"><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="1"/> §. X. But they object, <HI>That Works are not neces∣sary to Justification</HI>: First, because of that Saying of <HI>Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unprofita∣ble Ser∣vants.</NOTE> Luke 17.10. <HI>When ye shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofita∣ble Servants,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="2"/> Secondly; They object those Sayings of the Apostle, where he excludes the Deeds of the Law from Justification, as first, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.20. <HI>Because by the Deeds of the Law there shall be no Flesh</HI> Justified <HI>in his sight.</HI> And verse 28. <HI>Therefore we conclude, that a Man is</HI> Justified by Faith, <HI>without the Deeds of the Law.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="1"/> <HI>Answ.</HI> We have shewn already, what place we give to Works, even to the best of Works, in Justifi∣cation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Works of the Gos∣pel, or Grace, dis∣tinguished from that of the Law.</NOTE> and how we ascribe its immediate and for∣mal Cause to the <HI>Worker</HI> brought forth in us, but not to the <HI>Works.</HI> But in Answer to this Objection, I say there is a great difference betwixt the Works of the Law and those of Grace, or of the Gospel. The first are excluded, the second not, but are ne∣cessary. The first are those, which are performed in Man's own Will, and by his Strength, in a con∣formity to the outward Law and Letter; and there∣fore are Man's own imperfect Work, or Works of the Law, which <HI>makes nothing perfect</HI>: And to this belong all the Ceremonies, Purifications, Washings, and Traditions of the Jews. The second are the Works of the Spirit of Grace in the Heart, wrought in conformity to the Inward and Spiritual Law; which Works are not wrought in Man's Will, nor by his Power and Ability, but in and by the Power and Spirit of Christ <HI>in us,</HI> and therefore are pure and perfect in their kind (as shall hereafter be pro∣ved) and may be called Christ's Works, for that he is the immediate Author and Worker of them: Such Works we affirm absolutely necessary to Justifi∣cation, so that a Man cannot be Justified without them; and all Faith without them is dead and use∣less, as the Apostle <HI>James</HI> saith. Now, that such a distinction is to be admitted, and that the Works ex∣cluded by the Apostle, in the matter of Justification, are of the first kind, will appear, if we consider the occasion of the Apostle's mentioning this, as well here, as throughout in his Epistle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI>
<PB N="232" REF="003129_0123_0FF005124ED689C8"/>
where he speaks of this matter, and to this pur∣pose at large: Which was this, That whereas many of the Gentiles, that were not of the Race or Seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> as concerning the Flesh, were come to be Converted to the Christian Faith, and believe in him, some of those that were of the Jewish Pro∣selytes, thought to subject the Faithful and Believing Gentiles to the legal Ceremonies and Observations, as necessary to their Justification: This gave the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> occasion at length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The occa∣sion of the Apostle's speaking of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Law, which are ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.</NOTE> in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans, Galatians,</HI> and elsewhere, to shew the use and tendency of the Law, and of its Works, and to contra-distinguish them from the Faith of Christ, and the Righteousness thereof; shewing how the former was ceased, and become ineffectu∣al; the other remaining, and yet necessary. And that the Works excluded by the Apostle are of this kind of Works of the Law, appears by the strain of his Epistle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> Chap. 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4. For after (in <HI>Chap.</HI> 4.) he upbraideth them for their returning unto the Observation of <HI>Days</HI> and <HI>Times,</HI> and that (in the beginning of <HI>Chap.</HI> 5.) he sheweth them their Folly, and the Evil Conse∣quence of adhering to the Ceremonies of Circum∣cision; then he adds, v. 6. <HI>For in Christ Jesus neither Circumcision nor Uncircumcision availeth; but Faith, which worketh by love</HI>; and thus he concludes again, chap. 6. v. 15. <HI>For in Christ Jesus neither Circumcision availeth, nor Uncircumcision, but a new Creatre.</HI> From which places appeareth that distinction of Works before mentioned, whereof the one is excluded, the other necessary to Justification. For the Apostle sheweth here, that Circumcision (which word is often used to comprehend the whole Ceremonies and Legal Performances of the Jews,) is not ne∣cessary, nor doth avail. Here are then the Works which are excluded, by which no Man is Justified; but Faith, which <HI>worketh by love,</HI> but the <HI>new Crea∣ture,</HI> this is that which availeth, which is absolutely
<PB N="233" REF="003129_0123_0FF005124ED689C8"/>
necessary: For Faith, that <HI>worketh by love,</HI> cannot be without <HI>Works</HI>; for, as it is said in the same 5<HI>th</HI> Chapter, <HI>v.</HI> 22. <HI>Love is a Work of the Spirit</HI>: Also the New Creature, if it avail and be necessary, can∣not be without Works; seeing it is natural for it to bring forth Works of Righteousness. Again, that the Apostle no ways intends to exclude such good Works, appears, in that in the same Epistle he ex∣horts the <HI>Galatians</HI> to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The useful∣ness and necessity of <HI>good Works.</HI></NOTE> and holds forth the usefulness and necessity of them, and that very plainly, <HI>c.</HI> 6. <HI>v.</HI> 7, 8, 9. <HI>Be not deceived,</HI> saith he, <HI>God is not mocked; for whatsoever a Man soweth, that shall he also reap: for he that soweth to the</HI> Flesh, <HI>shall of the</HI> Flesh <HI>reap Corruption; but he that soweth in the</HI> Spirit, <HI>shall of the</HI> Spirit <HI>reap Life Everlasting.</HI> And <HI>let us not be weary of well doing, for in due season we shall reap, if we saint not</HI>: Doth it not hereby ap∣pear, how necessary the Apostle would have the <HI>Galatians</HI> know, that he esteemed good Works to be? To wit, not the outward Testimony and Tra∣dition of the Law, but the fruits of the Spirit, men∣tioned a little before; by which Spirit he would have them to be led, and walk in those good Works: As also, how much he ascribed to these good Works, by which he affirms Life Everlasting is reaped. Now, that cannot be useless to Man's Justification, which capacitates him to reap so rich a Harvest.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="2"/> But <HI>lastly</HI>; For a full Answer to this Objection, and for the establishing of this Doctrine of <HI>good Works,</HI> I shall instance another Saying of the same Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> which our Adversaries also in the blindness of their minds make use of against us; to wit, <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.5. <HI>Not by Works of Righteousness, which we have done, but acording to his Mercy be saved us,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Justified</HI> not by our legal Per∣formances, but the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Spirit.</NOTE> <HI>by the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</HI> It is generally granted by all, that [<HI>Sa∣ved</HI>] is here all one as if it had been said [<HI>Justified.</HI>] Now there are two kinds of Works h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mentioned;
<PB N="234" REF="003129_0124_0FF00514C621BB90"/>
one, by which we are not saved, that is, not Justi∣fied; and another, by which we are saved, or justi∣fied. The first, the Works of Righteousness which we have wrought, that is, which we in our first, fallen Nature, by our own strength, have wrought, our own <HI>legal Performances</HI>; and therefore may truly and properly be called ours, whatever specious ap∣pearances they may seem to have. And that it must needs, and ought to be so understood, doth appear from the other part, <HI>By the Washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost</HI>; seeing Regeneration is a Work, comprehensive of many good Works, even of all those which are called, <HI>The Fruits of the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> Now, in case it should be objected, <HI>That these may also be called ours, because wrought in us, and also by us many times, as Instruments.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; It is far otherwise than the former: For in the first, we are yet alive in our own Natural State, unrenewed, working of our selves, seeking to save our selves, by imitating and endeavouring a Conformity to the outward Letter of the Law; and so wrestling and striving in the Carnal Mind, that is enmity to God, and in the Cursed Wills, not yet subdued. But in this second, we are <HI>crucified with Christ,</HI> we are become <HI>dead with him,</HI> have <HI>partaken of the Fellowship of his Sufferings,</HI> are made <HI>conformable to his Death</HI>; and our first Man, our <HI>old Man with all his Deeds,</HI> as well the openly Wicked, as the seemingly Righ∣teous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not <HI>We,</HI> but <HI>Christ in us,</HI> is the Worker of Righteous∣ness.</NOTE> our legal Endeavours, and foolish Wrestlings, are all buried and nailed to the Cross of Christ; and so it is no more <HI>we,</HI> but <HI>Christ alive in us,</HI> the <HI>Worker in us.</HI> So that tho' it be <HI>We</HI> in a sense, yet it is according to that of the Apostle to the same <HI>Gal.</HI> c. 2. v. 20. <HI>I am crucified, yet nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: Not I, but the</HI> Grace <HI>of Christ in me</HI> These Works are especially to be ascribed to the Spirit of Christ, and the Grace of God <HI>in us,</HI> as being immediately thereby acted and led
<PB N="235" REF="003129_0124_0FF00514C621BB90"/>
in them, and enabled to perform them. And this manner of Speech is not strained, but familiar to the Apostles; as appears, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.8. <HI>For he that wrought effectually in</HI> Peter <HI>to the Apostleship of the Circumcision, the same was mighty in me,</HI> &amp;c. Phil. 2.13. <HI>For it is</HI> God <HI>which worketh in you, both to will and to do,</HI> &amp;c.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ." N="1"/> That no <HI>impure Works</HI> are useful to Justification, is confessed; but that all the Works wrought in the Saints are such, is denied.

<P N="12">§. XII. As to the other part, <HI>That seeing the best of Men are still</HI> Impure and Imperfect, <HI>therefore their</HI> Works <HI>must be so:</HI> It is to beg the question, and depends upon a Proposition denied; and which is to be discussed at further length in the next Proposition. But tho' we should suppose a Man not throughly Perfect in all respects; yet will not that hinder, but good and perfect Works in their kind may be brought forth in them by the Spirit of Christ: Neither doth the Example of Water going through an unclean Pipe hit the matter; because, tho' Water may be capable to be tinctured with uncleanness; yet the Spirit of God cannot, whom we assert to be the Immediate Author of those Works that avail in Ju∣stification: And therefore Jesus Christ his Works in his Children are pure and perfect, and he worketh in and through that <HI>pure thing</HI> of his own forming and creating in them. Moreover, if this did hold, according to our Adversaries supposition, <HI>That no Man ever was or can be perfect</HI>; it would follow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Were the Miracles and Works of the Apo∣stles, wrought by the Power of Christ in them, impure &amp; imperfect?</NOTE> that the very Miracles and Works of the Apostles, which Christ wrought in them, and they wrought in and by the Power, Spirit and Grace of Christ, were also impure and imperfect; such as their Con∣verting of the Nations to the Christian Faith; their Gathering of the Churches, their Writing of the Holy Scriptures; yea, and their offering up and Sa∣crificing of their Lives for the Testimony of Jesus. What may our Adversaries think of this Argument, whereby it will follow, that the Holy Scriptures, whose Perfection and Excellency they seem so much to magnifie, are proved to be impure and imperfect, because they came through impure and imperfect Vessels? It appears by the Confessions of Protestants, that the <HI>Fathers</HI> did frequently attribute unto Works of this kind, that <HI>Instrumental Work,</HI> which we have spoken of in Justification, (albeit some ignorant

in this place of our Sense and Belief con∣cerning that matter.

And for the more clear stating of the Controversie, let it be considered:</P>
<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1.</HI> Natural Knowledge</NOTE>§. II. <HI>First</HI>; That we place not this possibility in Man's own Will and Capacity, as he is a Man, the Son of fallen <HI>Adam,</HI> or as he is in his Natural State, however wise or knowing, or however much endued with a notional and literal Knowledge of Christ, thereby endeavouring a Conformity to the Letter of the Law, as it is outward.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2.</HI> The New Birth.</NOTE><HI>Secondly</HI>; That we attribute it wholly to Man, as he is Born again, renewed in his Mind, raised by Christ, knowing Christ alive, reigning and ru∣ling in him, and guiding and leading him by his Spirit, and revealing in him the Law of the Spirit of Life; which not only manifests and reproves Sin, but also gives power to come out of it.</P>
<PB N="243" REF="003129_0128_0FF0052138FDD030"/>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>; That by this we understand not such a Perfection as may not daily admit of a Growth;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>3</HI> Growth in Perfection.</NOTE> and consequently mean not, as if we were to be as Pure, Holy, and Perfect, as God in his Divine Attributes of Wisdom, Knowledge and Purity; but only a Per∣fection proportionable and answerable to Man's mea∣sure, whereby we are kept from Transgressing the Law of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He that improved his Two Talents, was no∣thing less accepted, than be with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</NOTE> and enabled to answer what he re∣quires of us; even as he that improved his Two Talents, so as to make Four of them, perfected his Work, and was so accepted of his Lord, as to be called a <HI>good and faithful Servant,</HI> nothing less than he that made his Five Ten. Even as a little Gold is perfect Gold in its kind, as well as a great Mass; and a Child hath a perfect Body, as well as a Man, tho' it daily grow more and more. Thus Christ is said, Luke 2.52. to have <HI>increased in Wisdom and Stature, and in favour with God and Man</HI>; tho' before that time he had never sinned, and was (no doubt) perfect, in a true and proper sense.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI>; Though a Man may witness this for a season, and therefore all ought to press after it;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>4.</HI> Wiles of the Enemy.</NOTE> yet we do not affirm, but those that have attained it in a measure, may, by the Wiles and Temptati∣ons of the Enemy, fall into Iniquity, and lose it sometimes, if they be not watchful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Every Sin weakens a Man in his Spiritual Condition, but doth not destroy him alto∣gether.</NOTE> and do not di∣ligently attend to <HI>that</HI> of God in the Heart.

<P><HI>Lastly</HI>; Tho' I affirm, that after a Man hath ar∣rived to such a Condition,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>5.</HI> Righte∣ousness made Na∣tural.</NOTE> in which a Man may not sin, he yet may sin; I will nevertheless not deny, but there may be a State attainable in this Life, in which to do <HI>Righteousness</HI> may become so natural to the Regenerate Soul, that in the stabi∣lity

of this Condition they cannot sin. Others may perhaps speak more certainly of this State, as ha∣ving arrived to it: For me, I shall speak modestly, as acknowledging my self not to have arrived at it; yet I dare not deny it, for that it seems so positively to be asserted by the Apostle, in these words, 1 John 3.9. <HI>He that is born of God, sinneth not; neither can he, because the</HI> Seed of God <HI>remaineth in him.</HI></P>

For <HI>he that sinneth, is the servant of sin,</HI> Rom. 6.16. and every Sin is an act of service and obedience to the Devil. So then, if the Saints sin daily in <HI>Thought, Word</HI> and <HI>Deed,</HI> yea, if the very Service they offer to God be Sin, surely they serve the Devil more than they do God: For besides that they give the Devil many intire Services, without mixture of the least grain to God; they give God not the least Service, in which the Devil hath not a large share: And if their Prayers, and all their Spiritual Performances, be sinful, the Devil is as much served by them in these, as God, and in most of them much more; since they confess, that many of them are performed without the Leadings and Influence of God's Spirit. Now who would not account him a foolish Master, among Men, who being able to do it, and also de∣sirous it might be so, yet would not provide a Way whereby his Children and Servants might serve him more intirely than his avow'd Enemy; or would not guard against their serving of him, but be so im∣prudent and unadvised in his contrivance, that what∣ever way his Servants and Children served him, they should no less, yea, often much more, serve his Ene∣my?

This Imperfection in the Saints, either proceeds from God, or from themselves.

If it be not of them∣selves, it must be of God, who hath not seen meet to allow them Grace in that degree to produce that effect: And what is this but to attribute to God the heighth of Injustice, to make him require his Children to forsake Sin, and yet not to afford them sufficient Means for so doing?

<P N="5">§. V. Thirdly;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Poorf</HI> III</NOTE> This evil Doctrine is <HI>highly In∣jurious to Jesus Christ, and greatly Derogates from the Power and Vertue of his</HI> Sacrifice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great and princi∣pal End of Christs Coming and Ap∣pearance was, for the removing of Sin, and to redeem us from all Iniquity.</NOTE> <HI>and renders his Com∣ing and Ministry,</HI> as to the great End of it, <HI>ineffectual.</HI> For Christ (as for other Ends) so principally he appeared for the Removing of Sin for the Gather∣ing a Righteous Generation, that might serve the Lord in Purity of Mind, and walk before him in Fear, and bring in Everlasting Righteousness, and that Evangelical Perfection which the Law could not do. Hence he is said, Tit. 2.14. <HI>To have given himself for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purifie unto himself a Peculiar People, zealous of good Works</HI>: This is certainly spoken of the Saints, while upon Earth. But contrary thereunto, these Men affirm, That <HI>we are never redeemed from all Ini∣quity</HI>; and so make Christ's giving of himself for us, void and ineffectual; and give the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> the Lye plainly, by denying, that <HI>Christ purifieth to him∣self a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</HI> How are they <HI>zealous of good Works,</HI> who are ever commit∣ting evil ones? How are they a purified People, that are still in Impurity, as are they that daily sin, un∣less Sin be accounted no impurity? Moreover it is said expresly, 1 John 3.5, 8. That <HI>for this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the Devil; and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins.</HI> But these Men make this purpose of none effect; for they will not have the Son of God to <HI>destroy the Works of the Devil in his Children,</HI> in this World: Neither will they at all believe, that he
<PB N="248" REF="003129_0131_0FF0052818B4C4A0"/>
was manifest to take away our Sins, seeing they plead a Necessity of always living in them. And lest any should wrest this place of the Apostle, as if it were spoken only of taking away the Guilt of Sin; as if it related not to this Life; the Apo∣stle, as of purpose to obviate such an Objection, adds in the following Verses, <HI>Whosoever abideth in him, sinneth not,</HI> &amp;c. I hope then they sin not daily in Thought, Word and Deed. <HI>Let no Man deceive you, he that doth Righteousness, is Righteous, even as he is Righteous; he that committeth</HI> Sin, <HI>is of the Devil:</HI> But he that sinneth daily in Thought, Word and Deed, committeth Sin; how comes such a one then to be the Child of God? And if Christ was mani∣fest to take away Sin, how strangely do they over∣turn the Doctrine of Christ, that deny that it is ever taken away here? And how injurious are they to the Efficacy and Power of Christ's Ap∣pearance? Came not Christ to gather a people out of Sin, into Righteousness; out from the Kingdom of Satan, into the <HI>Kingdom of the dear Son of God?</HI> And are not they, that are thus gathered by him, his Servants, his Children, his Bretheren, his Friends? <HI>Who as he was, so are they to be in this World, Holy, Pure and Undefiled.</HI> And doth not Christ still watch over them, stand by them, pray for them, and pre∣serve them by his Power and Spirit, walk in them, and dwell among them; even as the Devil, on the other hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Devil dwells a∣mong the Reprobates</NOTE> doth among the Reprobate Ones? How comes it then, that the Servants of Christ are less his Servants, than the Devil's are his? Or is Christ unwilling to have his Servants throughly pure? Which were gross Blasphemy to assert, con∣trary to many Scriptures. Or is he not able, by his Power to preserve and enable his Children to serve him? Which were no less Blasphemous to affirm of him; concerning whom the Scriptures declare, That he has <HI>Overcome</HI> Sin, Death, Hell, <HI>and the</HI> Grave, <HI>and Triumphed over them openly; and
<PB N="249" REF="003129_0131_0FF0052818B4C4A0"/>
that All Power in Heaven and Earth is given to him.</HI> But certainly, if the Saints sin daily in Thought, Word and Deed, as these Men assert, they serve the Devil daily, and are subject to his Power; and so he prevails more than Christ doth, and holds the Servants of Christ in bondage, whether Christ will or not. But how greatly then doth it contra∣dict the End of Christ's coming, as it is expressed by the Apostle, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.25, 26, 27. <HI>Even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it, that he might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing of Water, by the Word: That he might present it to himself a glo∣rious Church, not having spot or wrinkle,</HI> or any such thing; <HI>but that it should be holy, and without blemish.</HI> Now if Christ hath really thus answered the thing he came for, then the Members of this Church are not always finning in Thought, Word and Deed; or there is no difference betwixt being Sanctified and Unsanctified, Clean and Unclean, Holy and Un∣holy, being daily Blemished with Sin, and being without Blemish.</P>

Our Adversaries are Exalters of the Scriptures in words, much crying up their Usefulness and Per∣fection: Now the Apostle tells us, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.17.

Darkness, and calling Good Evil and Evil Good? Since they say, <HI>The very best Actions of</HI> God's Children <HI>are defiled and polluted; and that those that sin daily, in Thought; Word and Deed, are good Men and Women, the</HI> Saints <HI>and</HI> Holy Servants <HI>of the Holy Pure God:</HI> Can there be any thing more Repugnant than this, to common Reason?

But when there is more Unrighte∣ousness in a Man, than Righteousness; that Man ought rather to be denominated Unrighteous, than Righteous.

For Man not minding the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Law within his Heart,</HI> which not only discovers Sin, but leads out of it, and so being a stranger to the new Life and Birth that is Born of God, which naturally doth his Will, and cannot of its own Nature transgress the Com∣mandments of God, doth, I say, in his Natural State, look at the Commandments, as they are without him, in the Letter;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Letter kills, and maketh not alive.</NOTE> and finding himself reproved and convicted, is by the Letter killed, but not made alive. So Man, finding himself wounded, and not applying himself Inwardly to that which can heal, labours in his own Will after Conformity to the Law, as it is without him; which he can never obtain; but finds, the more he wrestles, the more he falleth short.

N="3"/> <HI>Thirdly</HI>; They object some Expressions of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. 7.19. <HI>For the good that I would, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.</HI> And Verse 24. <HI>O wretched Man that I am! who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death?</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; This Place infers nothing, unless it were apparent that the Apostle here were speak∣ing of his own Condition, and not rather in the Person of others, or what he himself had some∣times born; which is frequent in Scripture, as in the Case of <HI>Cursing,</HI> in <HI>James,</HI> before-mentioned. But there is nothing in the Text, that doth clearly sig∣nifie the Apostle to be speaking of himself, or of a Condition he was then under, or was always to be under; yea, on the contrary, in the former Chapter (as afore is at large shewn) he declares, They were <HI>dead to Sin</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Paul</HI> perso∣nates the Wretched Man, to shew them the Re∣deemer.</NOTE> demanding, <HI>how such should yet live any longer therein? Secondly</HI>; It appears, that the Apostle personated one not yet come to a Spi∣ritual Condition, in that he saith, Verse 14. <HI>But I am carnal, sold under Sin.</HI> Now, is it to be ima∣gined,
<PB N="259" REF="003129_0136_0FF00533D80F2A18"/>
that the apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> as to his own proper Condition, when he wrote that <HI>Epistle</HI> was a <HI>Car∣nal Man,</HI> who in <HI>chap.</HI> 1. testifies of himself, That he was <HI>separated to be an Apostle, capable to impart to the</HI> Romans <HI>spiritual Gifts</HI>; and chap. 8. ver. 2. That <HI>the Law of the</HI> Spirit of Life <HI>in Christ Jesus</HI> had <HI>made him free from the Law of</HI> Sin <HI>and Death</HI>? So then he was not <HI>Carnal.</HI> And seeing there are Spiritual Men in this Life, as our Adversaries will not de∣ny, and is intimated through this whole 8th Chap∣ter to the <HI>Romans</HI>; it will not be denied, but the Apostle was one of them. So then, as his calling himself <HI>Carnal,</HI> in chap 7. cannot be understood of his own proper state; neither can the rest of what he speaks there of that kind be so understood: Yea, after, vers. 24. where he makes that Exclamation, he adds in the next verse; <HI>I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord</HI>; signifying, that by him he witnessed deliverance; and so goeth on, shewing how he had obtained it, in the next Chapter, <HI>viz.</HI> 8. <HI>v.</HI> 35. <HI>Who shall separate us from the Love of Christ?</HI> And <HI>ver.</HI> 37. <HI>But in all these things we are more than Conquerors:</HI> And in the last verse, <HI>Nothing shall be able to sepa∣rate us,</HI> &amp;c. But where ever there is a continuing in Sin, there is a separation in some Degree; seeing every Sin is contrary to God, and <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. <HI>a Trans∣gression of the Law,</HI> 1 John 3.4. and whoever com∣mitteth the least Sin, is overcome of it; and so,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whom Sin has con∣quered, he is no Con∣queror.</NOTE> in that respect, is not a Conqueror, but conquered. This Condition then, which the Apostle plainly testified, he with some others had obtained, could not consist with continual remaining and abiding in Sin.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="4"/> <HI>Fourthly</HI>; They object the <HI>Faults and Sins of se∣veral eminent Saints, as</HI> Noah, David, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; That doth not at all prove the Case: For the Question is not, <HI>Whether good Men may not fall into sin?</HI> which is not denied; but, <HI>Whether it be not possible for them not to sin?</HI> It will not fol∣low,
<PB N="260" REF="003129_0137_0FF005368B626208"/>
because these Men <HI>sinned</HI>; that therefore they were never <HI>free of sin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Can they that sin, be never freed from Sin?</NOTE> but always <HI>sinned:</HI> For at this rate of Arguing, it might be urged according to this Rule <HI>Contraiorum par ratio,</HI> i. e. <HI>The reason of Contraries is alike:</HI> That if, because a good Man hath sinned once or twice, he can never be free from Sin, but must alway be daily and continually a Sinner all his Life long; then by the Rule of <HI>Con∣traries,</HI> If a wicked Man have done good once or twice, he can never be free from Righteousness, but must always be a righteous Man all his Life∣time: Which as it is most absurd in it self, so it is contrary to the plain Testimony of the Scripture, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.12, to 18.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="5"/> <HI>Lastly</HI> They Object, <HI>That if</HI> Perfection, <HI>or</HI> Free∣dom from Sin, <HI>be attainable, this will render</HI> Mortifica∣tion of Sin <HI>useless; and make the Blood of Christ of no service to us; neither need we any more pray for</HI> Forgive∣vess of Sins.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; I had almost omitted this Objection, because of the manifest Absurdity of it: For can Mortification of Sin be useless, where the end of it is obtained? Seeing there is no attaining of this Perfection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who fights, and not in hopes to overcome his Foe?</NOTE> but by Mortification. Doth the hope and belief of Overcoming, render the Fight un∣necessary? Let Rational Men judge, which hath most sense in it; to say, as our Adversaries do, <HI>It is necessary that we fight and wrestle, but we must ne∣ver think of overcoming; we must resolve still to be over∣come:</HI> Or to say, <HI>Let us fight, because we may over∣come?</HI> Whether do such as believe they may be cleansed by it, or those that believe they can ne∣ver be cleansed by it, render the <HI>Blood of Christ</HI> most Effectual? If two Men were both grievously diseased, and applied themselves to a Physician for remedy; which of those do most commend the Phy∣sician and his Cure, he that believeth he may be cured by him, and as he feels himself cured, con∣fesseth that he is so, and so can say, This is a skilful

Physcian, this is a good Medicine, behold I am made whole by it? Or he that never is cured, nor ever believes that he can, so long as he lives? As for praying f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Forgivness,</HI> we deny it not;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Praying for For∣giveness of Sin.</NOTE> for that <HI>all have sinned</HI>; and therefore all need to pray that their <HI>sins past</HI> may be blotted out, and that they may be daily preserved from sinning. And if ho∣ping or believing to be made free from Sin hinders praying for Forgiveness of Sin; it would follow, by the same inference, that Men ought not to forsake Murther, Adultery, or any of these gross Evils; seeing the more Men are Sinful, the more plenti∣ful occasion there would be of asking Forgiveness of Sin, and the more work for Mortification. But the Apostle hath sufficiently refuted such Sin-plea∣sing Cavils in these words, Rom. 6.1.2. <HI>Shall we continue in</HI> Sin, <HI>that</HI> Grace <HI>my abound? God for∣bid.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>lastly</HI>; It may be easily answered by a Re∣tortion to those that press this, from the words of the Lord's Prayer, <HI>Forgive us our debts,</HI> That this militates no less against perfect Justification, than against perfect Sanctification. For if all the Saints, the least as well as the greatest, be per∣fectly Justified in that very hour wherein they are Converted, as our Adversaries will have it, then they have Remission of Sins long before they die. May it not then be said to them. What need have ye to pray for Remission of Sin, who are already Justi∣fied, whose Sins are long ago forgiven, both past and to come?</P>

<HEAD><HI>PROPOSITION IX.</HI> Concerning Perseverance, and the Possibility of fal∣ling from Grace.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Altho' this <HI>Gift,</HI> &amp; <HI>inward Grace of God,</HI> be sufficient to work out <HI>Salvation;</HI> yet in those in whom it is re∣sisted, it both may and doth become their Condemna∣tion.

</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">§. I. THE first Sentence of this Proposition hath already been treated of in the <HI>fifth</HI> and <HI>sixth Propositions,</HI> where it hath been shewn, that that <HI>Light,</HI> which is given for Life and Salvation, becomes the Condemnation of those that refuse it; and therefore is already proved in those Places, where I did demonstrate the Possibility of Man's resisting the Grace and Spirit of God: And indeed, it is so apparent in the Scriptures, that it cannot be denied, by such as will but seriously consider these Testimonies, <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.24, 25, 26. <HI>John</HI> 3.18, 19. 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2.11, 12. <HI>Acts</HI> 7.51. <HI>&amp;</HI> 13.46. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.18.

The Testimonies of the Scripture, in∣cluded in the Proposition it self, are sufficient to

prove it to Men of unbyassed Judgment: But be∣cause, as to this part, our cause is common with many other Protestants, I shall be the more brief in it. For it is not my design to do that which is done already, neither do I covet to appear knowing, by writing much; but simply purpose to present to the World a faithful account of our Principles; and briefly to let them understand, what we have to say for our selves.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I.</HI> A falling from Grace by Disobe∣dience, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inced.</NOTE></P>

<P><LIST TYPE="syllogism"><HEAD>Arg. 3.</HEAD>
<ITEM>If Men may have tasted of the <HI>Heavenly Gift,</HI> and been made Partakers of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> and afterwards <HI>fall away;</HI> they must needs have known in Measure the Operation of <HI>God's Saving Grace and Spirit,</HI> without which no Man could taste the <HI>Heavenly Gift,</HI> nor yet partake of the <HI>Holy Spirit:</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>But the first is true:</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore also the Last.</ITEM></LIST></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>II.</HI> The Doct∣rine of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion and Reprobati∣on is in∣consistent with Preaching, and daily Exhorta∣tion.</NOTE><HI>Secondly</HI>; Seeing the contrary Doctrine is built upon this false <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> That <HI>Grace is not given for</HI> Salvation <HI>to any, but to a certain</HI> Elect Number, <HI>which cannot lose it; and that all the rest of Mankind, by an</HI> absolute Decree, <HI>are debarred from Grace and Salva∣tion</HI>; that being destroy'd, this falls to the Ground. Now as that Doctrine of theirs is wholly inconsist∣ent with the daily Practice of those that preach it; in that they exhort People to believe and be saved, while in the mean Time, if they belong to the De∣cree of Reprobation, it is simply impossible for them so to do; and if to the Decree of Election, it is needless: Seeing it is as impossible to them to miss of
<PB N="265" REF="003129_0139_0FF0053ADA46B328"/>
it, as hath been before demonstrated. So also in this matter of Perseverance, their Practice and Prin∣ciples are no less inconsistent and contradictory. For while they daily exhort People to be Faithful to the end, shewing them, if they continue not, they shall be cut-off, and fall short of the Reward; which is very true: But no less inconsistent with that Doctrine, that affirms, <HI>There is no hazard, because no possibility of departing from the least measure of true Grace:</HI> Which if true, it is to no purpose to be∣seech them to <HI>stand,</HI> to whom God hath made it impossible to <HI>fall.</HI> I shall not longer insist upon the Probation of this; seeing what is said, may suffice to answer my design; and that the thing is also abundantly proved by many of the same Judgment. That this was the Doctrine of the Primitive Pro∣testants, thence appears, that the <HI>Augustane Confession</HI> condemns it as an Error of the <HI>Anababtists,</HI> to say, <HI>That who once are Justified, they cannot lose the Holy Spirit</HI>: Many such like Sayings are to be found in the common places of <HI>Philip Melancthon.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Opini∣on of the Fathers concerning <HI>falling from Grace</HI></NOTE> <HI>Vossius</HI> in his <HI>Pelagian</HI> History, <HI>lib.</HI> 6. testifies, <HI>That this was the common Opinion of the Fathers:</HI> In the Confirma∣tion of the <HI>Twelfth Thesis,</HI> page 587. he hath these words; <HI>That this, which we have said, was the</HI> Common Sentiment of Antiquity, <HI>those at present can only deny, who otherways perhaps are Men not unlearned, but ne∣vertheless in Antiquity altogether strangers,</HI> &amp;c. These things thus observed, I come to the Objections of our Opposers.</P>
<P N="3"><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="1"/> §. III. <HI>First,</HI> they alledge, <HI>That those places mentioned of making</HI> Shipwrack of Faith, <HI>is only understood of seeming Faith, and not of a real true Faith.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> This Objection is very weak, and apparently con∣trary to the Text, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.19. where the Apostle addeth to <HI>Faith,</HI> a <HI>good Conscience,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A good &amp; evil Consci∣ence.</NOTE> by way of Com∣plaint: Whereas, if their Faith had been only seeming and hypocritical, the Men had been better without it, than with it; neither had they been
<PB N="266" REF="003129_0140_0FF0053D535668B0"/>
worthy of blame, for losing that, which in it self was evil. But the Apostle expresly adds, [<HI>and of a good Conscience,</HI>] which shews it was Real; nei∣ther can it be supposed, that Men could truly attain a good Conscience, without the Operation of God's Saving Grace; far less, that a good Conscience doth consist with a seeming, false, and hypocritical Faith. Again, These places of the Apostle being spoken by way of Regret, clearly import, that these At∣tainments they had fallen from, were good and real, not false and deceitful; else he would not have Regretted their falling from them: And so he saith positively, <HI>They tasted of the</HI> Heavenly Gift <HI>and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</HI> &amp;c. not that they seem'd to be so; which sheweth this <HI>Ob∣jection</HI> is very frivolous.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="2"/> <HI>Secondly</HI>; They alledge, Phil. 1.6. <HI>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good Work in you, will perform it, until the day of Jesus Christ,</HI> &amp;c. and 1 Pet. 1.5. <HI>Who are kept by the</HI> Power of God <HI>through Faith unto Salvation.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> These Scriptures, as they do not affirm any thing positively contrary to us, so they cannot be under∣stood otherwise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salvation is proposed upon cer∣tain Condi∣tions by us to be per∣formed.</NOTE> than as the Condition is perform∣ed upon our part; seeing <HI>Salvation</HI> is no other ways proposed there, but upon certain necessary Condi∣tions to be performed by us; as hath been above proved, and as our Adversaries also acknowledge, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.13. <HI>For if ye live after the</HI> Flesh, <HI>ye shall die; but if ye through the</HI> Spirit <HI>do mortifie the deeds of the Body, ye shall live.</HI> And Heb. 3.14. <HI>We are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our Confidence stedfast unto the end.</HI> For if these places of the Scripture, upon which they build their Objection, were to be admitted without these Conditions, it would manifestly overturn the whole Tenor of their Exhortations throughout all their Writings. Some other Objections there are, of the same nature, which are solved by the same Answers;
<PB N="267" REF="003129_0140_0FF0053D535668B0"/>
which also, because largely treated of by others, I omit; to come to that Testimony of the Truth, which is more especially ours in this matter, and is contained in the latter part of the Proposition, in these words; <HI>Yet such an increase and stability in the Truth may in this Life be attained, from which there cannot be a total Apostasie.</HI></P>
<P N="4">§. IV. As in the Explanation of the <HI>fifth</HI> and <HI>sixth Propositions</HI> I observed, that some, that had de∣nied the Errors of others concerning <HI>Reprobation,</HI> and affirmed the <HI>Universality of Christ's Death,</HI> did notwithstanding fall short in sufficiently holding forth the Truth; and so gave the contrary party occasion, by their defects, to be strengthned in their Errors: So may it be said in this Case.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The two Extreams some run into, by asserting a final fal∣ling or not falling from Grace impossible.</NOTE> As upon the one hand they Err, that affirm, <HI>That the least degree of true and saving</HI> Grace <HI>cannot be fallen from</HI>; so do they Err upon the other hand, that deny any such <HI>stability</HI> to be attained, <HI>from which there cannot be a total and final Apostasie.</HI> And be∣twixt these two Extreams lieth the Truth apparent in the Scriptures, which God hath revealed unto us by the Testimony of his Spirit, and which also we are made sensible of, by our own sensible Ex∣perience. And even as in the former Controversie was observed, so also in this, the defence of Truth will readily appear to such as serously weigh the matter: For the Arguments upon both hands, rightly applied, will as to this hold good; and the Objections, which are strong, as they are re∣spectively urged against the two opposite false Opi∣nions, are here easily solved, by the establishing of this Truth. For all the Arguments, which these alledge that affirm, <HI>There can be no falling away,</HI> may well be received upon the one part, as of those who have attained to this Stability and Esta∣blishment, and their Objections solved by this Con∣fession; so upon the other hand, the Arguments alledged from Scripture-Testimonies, by those that
<PB N="268" REF="003129_0141_0FF0053F24C928F8"/>
affirm the <HI>possibility of falling away,</HI> may well be re∣ceived of such, as are not come to this Establish∣ment, tho' having attained a measure of true Grace. Thus then the contrary Batterings of our Adver∣saries, who miss the Truth, do concur the more strongly to establish it, while they are destroying each other. But lest this may not seem to suffice to satisfie such as judge it always <HI>possible for the best of Men, before they die, to fall away</HI>; I shall add, for the proof of it, some brief Considerations, from some few Testimonies of the Scripture.</P>
<P N="5"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I.</HI> Watchful∣ness and Diligence is of Indis∣pensible ne∣cessity to all.</NOTE>§. V. And <HI>first,</HI> I freely acknowledge, that it is good for all to be Humble, and in this respect not over Confident, so as to lean to this, to foster them∣selves in Iniquity, or lie down in Security, as if they had attained this Condition; seeing <HI>Watchfulness</HI> and <HI>Diligence</HI> is of <HI>indispensible necessity</HI> to all Mortal Men, so long as they breathe in this World: For God will have this to be the constant Practise of a <HI>Chri∣stian,</HI> that thereby he may be the more fit to serve him, and better armed against all the Temptations of the Enemy. For since the <HI>Wages of Sin is Death,</HI> there is no Man, while he sinneth, and is subject thereunto, but may lawfully suppose himself capa∣ble of perishing: Hence the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> himself saith, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.27. <HI>But I keep under my Body, and bring it into</HI> subjection; <HI>lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my self should be a cast-away.</HI> Here the Apostle supposeth it possible for him to be <HI>a cast-away</HI>; and yet it may be judged, he was far more advanced in the Inward Work of Regene∣ration, when he wrote that Epistle, than many who now a-days too presumptuously suppose they can∣not fall away; because they feel themselves to have attained some small degree of true Grace. But the Apostle makes use of this Supposition, or Possibility of his being <HI>a Cast-away</HI> (as I before observed) as an Inducement to him to be Watchful; <HI>I keep under my Body, last,</HI> &amp;c. Nevertheless, the same Apostle at
<PB N="269" REF="003129_0141_0FF0053F24C928F8"/>
another time, in the sense and feeling of God's Holy Power, and in the Dominion thereof, finding himself a Conqueror there through over Sin and his Soul's Enemies, maketh no difficulty to affirm, Rom. 8.38. <HI>For I am perswaded, that neither Death nor Life,</HI> &amp;c. Which clearly sheweth, that he had attained a Condition, from which he knew he could not fall away.</P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>II.</HI> A Con∣dition at∣tainable in this life, from which there is no falling away.</NOTE> It appears such a Condition is at∣tainable, because we are Exhorted to it; and, as hath been proved before, the Scripture never pro∣poseth to us things impossible. Such an Exhorta∣tion we have from the Apostle, 2 Pet. 1.10. <HI>Where∣fore the rather, Bretheren, give diligence to make your Calling and Election sure.</HI> And tho' there be a Con∣dition here proposed; yet since we have already proved, that it is possible to fulfil this Condition, then also the Promise annexed thereunto may be attained. And since, where Assurance is wanting, there is still a place left for doubtings and despairs; if we would affirm it never attainable, then should there never be a place known by the Saints in this World, wherein they might be free of doubting and despair: Which as it is most absurd in it self, so it is contrary to the manifest Experience of Thousands.</P>

A certain Assurance and Esta∣blishment given of God to ma∣ny of his Saints and Children.</NOTE> a full and certain Assurance, that they are his, and that no Power shall be able to pluck them out of his hand. But this Assurance would be no Assurance, if those, who are so <HI>Assured,</HI> were not <HI>Established</HI> and <HI>Confirmed,</HI> beyond all doubt and hesitation: If so, then surely there is no possibility for such to miss of that which God hath assured them of. And that there is such Assurance attainable in this Life, the Scripture abundantly declareth, both in general, and as to particular Persons. As <HI>first</HI>; Rev. 3.12. <HI>Him that overcometh, will I make a Pillar

in the</HI> Temple of my God, <HI>and he shall go no more out,</HI> &amp;c. which containeth a General Promise unto All. Hence the Apostle speaks of some that are <HI>sealed,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.22. <HI>Who hath also sealed us, and given the Earnest of the</HI> Spirit <HI>in our Hearts:</HI> Where∣fore the Spirit so sealing, is called the <HI>Earnest</HI> or <HI>Pledge of our inheritance,</HI> Eph. 1.13. <HI>In whom ye were sealed by the</HI> Holy Spirit <HI>of Promise.</HI> And therefore the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> not only in that of the <HI>Romans</HI> above∣noted, declareth himself to have attained that Con∣dition; but 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.7. he affirmeth in these words, <HI>I have fought a good Fight,</HI> &amp;c. which also many good Men have and do witness. And therefore, as there can be nothing more manifest, than that which the <HI>manifest Experience</HI> of this Time sheweth, and there∣in is found agreeable to the Experience of former Times; so we see, there have been both of <HI>old</HI> and of <HI>late,</HI> that have <HI>turned the</HI> Grace of God into <HI>Wan∣tonness,</HI> and have <HI>fallen from their Faith and Integrity</HI>; thence we may safely conclude such a falling away possible. We also see, that some of old and of late have attained a certain Assurance, some time before they departed, that they should <HI>Inherit Eternal Life</HI>; and have accordingly died in that <HI>good hope:</HI> Of and concerning whom, the Spirit of God testified, <HI>That they are saved.</HI> Wherefore we also see, such a State is attainable in this Life, from which there is not a falling away: For seeing the Spirit of God did so testifie, it was not possible, that they should perish; concerning whom <HI>He, who cannot lye,</HI> thus bare witness.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PROPOSITION X.</HI> Concerning the Ministry.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>As by the <HI>Light,</HI> or <HI>Gift of God</HI> all true Knowledge in things spiritual is received and revealed, so by the same, as it is manifested and received in the Heart, by the strength &amp; power thereof, every true <HI>Minister</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> is ordained, prepared, and supplied in the Work of the <HI>Ministry;</HI> and by the leading, moving, and drawing hereof, ought every <HI>Evangelist</HI> and <HI>Christian Pastor</HI> to be led and ordered in his labour and work of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> both as to the Place <HI>where,</HI> as to the Persons <HI>to whom,</HI> and as to the Time <HI>wherein</HI> he is to minister. Moreover, they who have this Au∣thority, may and ought to preach the <HI>Gospel,</HI> though without <HI>Humane Commission</HI> or <HI>Literature;</HI> as on the other hand, they who want the Authority of this <HI>Divine Gift,</HI> however learned or authorized by the <HI>Commission</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Churches,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gospel to be preach'd freely. <HI>Mat. 10.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></NOTE> are to be esteem∣ed but as <HI>Deceivers,</HI> and not true <HI>Ministers of the Gospel.</HI> Also they who have received this holy and unspotted Gift, <HI>as they have freely received it, so are they freely to give it,</HI> without Hire or Bargain∣ing, far less to use it as a <HI>Trade</HI> to get Money by. Yet if God hath called any one from their Employ∣ment or Trades, by which they acquire their Liveli∣hood; it may be lawful for such, according to the Liberty which they feel given them in the Lord, to receive such <HI>Temporals</HI> (to wit, what may be need∣ful for them for Meat and Cloathing) as are given them freely and cordially by those, to whom they have communicated <HI>Spirituals.</HI></P>

That which in this Proposition is pro∣posed, is, <HI>What makes or constitutes any a Minister of the Church, what his Qualifications ought to be, and how he ought to behave himself</HI>? But because it may seem somwhat preposterous, to speak of the <HI>distinct Offices</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> until something be said of the <HI>Church</HI> in general, tho' nothing positively be said of it in the Proposition; yet as here implied, I shall briefly premise something thereof, and then proceed to the particular Members of it.</P>
<P N="2">§ II.

Now the Church in this respect, hath been in being in all Generations; for God never want∣ed some such Witnesses for him, tho' many times slighted, and not much observed by this World: And therefore this Church, tho' still in being, hath been oftentimes, as it were Invisible, in that it hath not come under the Observation of the Men of this World, being, as saith the Scripture, Jer. 3.14. <HI>One of a City, and two of a Family.</HI> And yet tho' the Church thus considered, may be as it were hid from wicked Men, as not then gathered into a <HI>Vi∣sible Fellowship,</HI> yea, and not observed even by some that are Members of it; yet may there notwith∣standing many belong to it: As when <HI>Elias</HI> com∣plained, he was <HI>left alone,</HI> 1 Kings 19.18.

and Houshold in certain respects, do each of them watch over, teach, instruct, and care for one ano∣ther, according to their several Measures and At∣tainments: Such were the Churches of the Primitive Times, gathered by the Apostles; whereof we have divers mentioned in the Holy Scriptures.

<P N="4">§. IV.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How to be∣came a Member of that Church</NOTE> To be a <HI>Member</HI> then of the <HI>Catholick Church,</HI> there is need of the <HI>Inward Calling of God</HI> by his <HI>Light in their Heart,</HI> and a being leavened into the Nature and Spirit of it, so as to forsake Unrighteousness, and be turn'd to Righteousness, and in the inwardness of the Mind to be cut out of the wild Olive-Tree of our own first fallen Na∣ture, and ingrafted into Christ by his Word and Spirit in the heart. And this may be done in those, who are strangers to the History, (God not ha∣ving pleased to make them partakers thereof) as in the <HI>fifth</HI> and <HI>sixth Propositions</HI> hath already been proved.</P>
<P>To be a <HI>Member</HI> of a particular <HI>Church of Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The out∣ward Pro∣fession of the Mem∣bers of the true Church</NOTE> as this Inward Work is indispensibly necessary, so is also the Outward Profession of, and Belief in Jesus Christ, and those holy Truths delivered by his Spirit in the Scriptures; seeing the Testimony of the Spirit recorded in the Scriptures, doth an∣swer the Testimony of the same Spirit in the Heart, even as <HI>face answereth face in a glass.</HI> Hence it fol∣lows, that the inward Work of Holiness, and for∣saking Iniquity, is necessary in every respect to the being a Member in the Church of Christ; and that the outward Profession is necessary to be a Member of a particular gathered Church, but not to the being a Member of the Catholick Church; yet it is absolutely necessary, where God affords the opportunity of knowing it: And the outward

Testimony is to be believed, where it is presented and revealed; the Sum whereof hath, upon other occasions, been already proved.</P>
<P N="5">§. V. But contrary hereunto, the Devil, that worketh and hath wrought in the <HI>Mystery of Ini∣quity,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mem∣bers of the Antichri∣stian Church in the Aposta∣cy, their empty Pro∣fession.</NOTE> hath taught his Followers to affirm, <HI>That no Man, however holy, is a Member of the Church of Christ, without the outward Profession; and that he be initiated thereunto by some outward Ceremonies.</HI> And again, <HI>That Men who have this outward Profession, though inwardly unholy, may be Members of the true</HI> Church of Christ, <HI>yea, and ought to be so esteemed.</HI> This is plainly to put <HI>Light</HI> for <HI>Darkness,</HI> and <HI>Dark∣ness</HI> for <HI>Light</HI>; as if God had a greater regard to Words than Actions, and were more pleased with vain Professions, than with real Holiness: But these things I have sufficiently refuted heretofore. Only from hence, let it be observed, that upon this false and rotten Foundation <HI>Antichrist</HI> hath builded his Babylonish Structure, and the Antichristian Church in the Apostasie hath hereby reared her self up to that Heighth and Grandeur she hath attained; so as to exalt her self above <HI>all that is called God, and sit in the Temple of God, as God.</HI></P>

<P N="7"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quest. I.</NOTE>§. VII. That then, which comes first to be questioned in this matter, is, concerning the <HI>Call of a Minister</HI>; to wit, <HI>What maketh, or how cometh a Man to be a Minister, Pastor, or Teacher in the Church of Christ?</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> We answer; By the <HI>inward Power and Vertue of the Spirit of God.</HI> For, as saith our Proposition, <HI>Having received the true Knowledge of things spiritual,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Call of a <HI>Minister,</HI> and where∣in it con∣sisteth.</NOTE> <HI>by the</HI> Spirit of God, (<HI>without which they cannot be known) and being by the same in measure purified and sanctified, he comes thereby to be called and moved to minister to others</HI>; being able to speak from a Living Experience, of what he himself is a witness; and therefore, <HI>knowing the Terrors of the Lord, he is fit to perswade Men,</HI> &amp;c. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.11.

Our Adversaries are forced to confess, that this were indeed de∣sirable, and best; but this they will not have to be absolutely necessary. I shall first prove the Necessity of it; and then shew how much they err in that, which they make more necessary than this Divine and Heavenly Call.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Arg."/> <HI>First</HI>: That which is necessary to make a Man a <HI>Christian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1.</HI> The ne∣cessity of an Inward Call to make a man a Christian.</NOTE> so as without it he cannot be truly one, must be much more necessary to make a Man a <HI>Mini∣ster of Christianity</HI>; seeing the one is a degree above the other, and has it included in it: Nothing less than he, that supposeth a Master, supposeth him first to have attained the Knowledge and Capacity of a Scholar. They that are not Christians, cannot be Teachers and Ministers among Christians:</P>
<P>But this Inward Call, Power and Vertue of the Spirit of God, is necessary to make a Man a Christian; as we have abundantly proved before in the Second Proposition, according to these Scriptures, <HI>He that hath not the</HI> Spirit of Christ, <HI>is none of his.

<PB N="281" REF="003129_0147_0FF0054B15D64948"/>
<P><HI>Therefore</HI> this Call, Moving and Drawing of the Spirit, must be much more necessary to make a <HI>Minister.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2.</HI> The Mi∣nistry of the Spirit requires the Opera∣tion and Testimony of the Spi∣rit.</NOTE> All <HI>Ministers</HI> of the <HI>New Testament</HI> ought to be Ministers of the Spirit, and not of the Letter, according to that 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.6. and as the old Latin hath it, <HI>Not by the Letter, but by the Spirit</HI>: But how can a Man be a Minister of the Spirit, who is not inwardly Called by it? And who looks not upon the Operation and Testimony of the Spirit, as Es∣sential to his Call? As he could not be a Minister of the Letter, who had thence no ground for his Call, yea, that was altogether a stranger to, and unacquainted with it; so neither can he be a Mi∣nister of the Spirit, who is a stranger to it, and unacquainted with the Motions thereof, and knows it not to draw, act, and move him, and go before him in the Work of the Ministry. I would willing∣ly know, how those that take upon them to be Mi∣nisters (as they suppose) of the Gospel, meerly from an outward Vocation, without so much as being any ways sensible of the Work of the Spirit, or any In∣ward Call therefrom, can either satisfie themselves or others, that they are Ministers of the Spirit, or wherein they differ from the Ministers of the Letter?

<PB N="286" REF="003129_0150_0FF005526E7DDEE8"/>
And it's clear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Form (of Godli∣ness) is en∣tail'd to the Power and Substance, and not the Substance to the Form</NOTE> that no Man nor Church, tho' truly Called of God, and as such having the Authority of a Church and Minister, can any long∣er retain that Authority, than they retain the Pow∣er, Life and Righteousness of Christianity: For the Form is intail'd to the Power and Substance; and not the Substance to the Form. So that when a Man ceaseth inwardly in his Heart to be a Christi∣an (where his Christianity must lie) by turning to Satan, and becoming a Reprobate, he is no more a Christian, tho' he retain the Name and Form; than a dead man is a Man, tho' he hath the Image and Representation of one; or than the Picture or Statue of a Man is a Man: And tho' a dead Man may serve to a Painter to retain some imperfect Representation of the Man, that somtimes was alive, and so one Picture may serve to make ano∣ther by; yet none of those can serve to make a true Living Man again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Succession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrupted</HI></NOTE> neither can they convey the Life and Spirit of the Man; it must be God, that made the Man at first, that alone can revive him.

So it is in Spiritual things;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Living Members make the Church: Life lost, the Church i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ceasing.</NOTE> it is the Life of Christianity, taking place in the Heart, that makes a Christian; and so it is a number of such, being alive, joined together in the Life of Christianity, that make a Church of Christ; and it is all those, that are thus alive and quick∣ned, considered together, that make the Catholick Church of Christ: Therefore where this Life ceas∣eth in one, then that one ceaseth to be a Christian; and all Power, Vertue and Authority, which he had as a Christian, ceaseth with it: So that if he hath
<PB N="287" REF="003129_0150_0FF005526E7DDEE8"/>
been a Minister or a Teacher, he ceaseth to be so any more: And tho' he retain the Form, and hold to the Authority in words, yet that signifies no more, nor is it of any more real Vertue and Au∣thority, than the meer Image of a dead Man. And as this is most agreeable to Reason, so it is the Scriptures Testimony; for it is said of <HI>Judas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Judas</HI> sell from his Ministry by Trans∣gression.</NOTE> Acts 1.25. <HI>That</HI> Judas <HI>sell from his Ministry and Apostle∣ship by Transgression</HI>; so his Transgression caused him to cease to be an Apostle any more: Whereas, had the Apostleship been entailed to his Person, so that Transgression could not cause him to lose it, until he had been formally degraded by the <HI>Church</HI> (which <HI>Judas</HI> never was, so long as he lived) <HI>Judas</HI> had been as really an Apostle, after he betrayed Christ, as before. And as it is of one, so of many, yea, of a whole Church: For seeing nothing makes a Man truly a Christian, but the Life of Christianity, in∣wardly Ruling in his Heart; so nothing makes a Church, but the gathering of several true Christi∣ans into one Body. Now where all these Members lose this Life, there the Church ceaseth to be, tho' they still uphold the Form, and retain the Name: For when that which made them a Church, and for which they were a Church, ceaseth; then they cease also to be a Church: And therefore the Spi∣rit, speaking to the Church of <HI>Laodicea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Luke-warmness of the Church of <HI>Laodicea.</HI></NOTE> because of her <HI>Luke-warmness,</HI> Rev. 3.16. threatneth to <HI>spue her out of his Mouth.</HI> Now, suppose the Church of <HI>Laodicea</HI> had continued in that <HI>Luke warmness</HI> and had come under that Condemnation and Judgment, tho' she had retained the Name and Form of a Church, and had had her Pastors and Ministers, as no doubt she had at that time; yet surely she had been no true Church of Christ, nor had the Au∣thority of her Pastors and Teachers been to be re∣garded, because of an outward Succession, tho' per∣haps some of them had it immediately from the Apostles. From all which I infer, That since the

But our Adversaries acknowledge, <HI>That many, if not most of those, by and through whom they derive this Autho∣rity, were altogether destitute of this Life and Vertue of Christianity: Therefore they could neither receive, have, nor transmit any Christian Authority.</HI></P>

to a certain Name and Family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Estate void of Heirship devolves to the Prince, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one clai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it but whom he sees meet to give it: So the Heir∣ship of Life is e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yed from Christ the true Heir.</NOTE> when that Family weareth out, and there is no lawful Suc∣cessor found of it, that can make a just Title ap∣pear, as being really of Blood and Affinity to the Family; it is not lawful for any one of another Race or Blood, because he assumes the Name or Arms of that Family, to possess the Estate, and claim the Superiorities and Prilviledges of the Fa∣mily; but by the Law of Nations the Inheritance devolves into the Prince as being <HI>Ultimus haeres</HI>; and so he giveth it again immediately to whom he sees meet, and makes them bear the Name and Arms of the Family, who then are entitled to the Privi∣ledges and Revenues thereof. So in like manner, the True Name and Title of a <HI>Christian,</HI> by which he hath Right to the <HI>Heavenly Inheritance,</HI> and is a Mem∣ber of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> is inward <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Holi∣ness,</HI> and the Mind redeemed from the <HI>Vanities, Lusts,</HI> and <HI>Iniquities</HI> of this World; and a gathering or Company, made up of such Members, makes a <HI>Church.</HI> Where this is lost, the Title is lost; and so the true Seed, to which the Promise is, and to which the In∣heritance is due, becomes extinguished in them, and they become dead as to it; and so it retires, and devolves it self again into Christ, who is the Righ∣teous <HI>Heir of Life</HI>; and he gives the Title and true Right again immediately; to whom it pleaseth him, even to as many as being turned to his <HI>pure Light</HI> in their <HI>Consciences,</HI> come again to walk in his <HI>Righteous</HI> and <HI>Innocent Life,</HI> and so become true Members of his <HI>Body</HI> which is the <HI>Church.</HI> So the Authority, Power and Heirship is not annexed to Persons, as they bear the bare Names or retain a Form, hold∣ing the meer Shell or Shadow of <HI>Christanity</HI>: But the Promise is to <HI>Christ,</HI> and to the <HI>Seed</HI> in whom the Authority is inherent, and in as many as are one with him, and united unto him by Purity and Holiness, and by the inward Renovation and Re∣generation of their Minds.</P>

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; This Objection as to us saith nothing; seeing we accuse, and are ready from the Scriptures to prove the Protestants guilty of gross Errors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A differ∣ence object∣ed between a constitu∣ting Church and one as constituted</NOTE> and needing Reformation, as well as they did, and do the Papists; and therefore we may justly lay claim, if we would, to the same Extraordinary Call, ha∣ving the same Reason for it, and as good evidence to prove ours, as they had for theirs. As for that Maxim, viz. <HI>That the Case is different in a constituting Church, and a Church constituted,</HI> I do not deny it; and therefore there may be a greater measure of Power required to the one, than to the other; and God in his Wisdom distributes the same as he sees meet. But that the same Immediate Assistance of the Spirit is not necessary for Ministers in a Gathered Church, as well as in Gathering One, I see no solid Reason alledged for it. For sure Christ's Promise was, <HI>To be with his Children to the end of the World</HI>; and they need him no less to pre∣serve and guide his Church and Children, than to gather and beget them. Nature taught the Gentiles this Maxim,
<Q>Non minor est Virtus, quam quaerere, parta, tueri.</Q>
Englished thus,
<Q><L>For to Defend what ye attain,</L>
<L>Requires no less Strength than to gain.</L></Q>
For it is by this Inward and Immediate Operation of the Spirit (which Christ hath promised <HI>to lead his Children</HI> with <HI>into all Truth,</HI> and <HI>to teach them all things)</HI> that Christians are to be led in all steps (as well last as first) which relates to God's Glory

<P N="14">§. XIV. From all this then we do firmly con∣clude, that not only in a general Apostasie it is needful, Men be extraordinarily Called, and raised up by the Spirit of God; but that even when se∣veral Assemblies or Churches are gathered by the Power of God, (not only into the Belief of the Principles of Truth, so as to deny Errors and He∣resies, but also into the Life, Spirit and Power of Christianity, so as to be the Body and House of Christ indeed, and a fit Spouse for him) that he who gathers them, doth also, for the preserving them in a lively,<NOTE PLACE="marg">True <HI>Mini∣sters</HI> Qua∣lifications, Call and Title.</NOTE> fresh and powerful Condition, raise up, and move among them by the inward im∣mediate Operation of his own Spirit, Ministers and Teachers, to instruct, and teach, and watch over them: Who being thus called, are manifest in the Hearts of their <HI>Brethren,</HI> and their Call is thus ve∣rified in them; who, by the feeling of that Life and Power that passeth through them, being inwardly builded up by them daily in the <HI>most holy Faith,</HI> be∣come the Seals of their <HI>Apostleship.</HI> And this is an∣swerable to another Saying of the same Apostle <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 2 Cor. 13.3. <HI>Since ye seek a proof of Christ's speaking in me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their <HI>lay∣ing on of hands,</HI> a mock to God and man; a keeping the <HI>Shadow,</HI> whilst the <HI>Substance</HI> is wanting.</NOTE> <HI>which to you wards is not weak, but is mighty in you.</HI> So this is that which gives a <HI>true substantiall Call</HI> and <HI>Title</HI> to a Minister, whereby he is a real Successor of the Vertue, Life and Power that was in the Apostles, and not of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are Name: And to such Ministers, we think the outward Ceremony of <HI>Ordination,</HI> or <HI>laying on of Hands,</HI> not necessary; neither can we see the use of it: Seeing our Adversaries, who use it, acknowledge, that the Vertue and Power of

<P N="15">§. XV.

<P>The <HI>two first</HI> they reckon necessary to the <HI>being</HI> of a Minister, so as a Man cannot be one without them; the <HI>third</HI> they say goeth to the <HI>well-being</HI> of one, but not to the <HI>being</HI>; so that a Man may truly be a lawful Minister without it, and ought to be heared and received as such. But we (supposing a Natural Capacity, that one be not an Idiot) judge the Grace of God indispensibly necessary to the ve∣ry <HI>being</HI> of a Minister, as that without which any can neither be a true, nor lawful, nor good Minister. As for <HI>Letter Learning,</HI> we judge it not so much ne∣cessary to the <HI>well-being</HI> of one, tho' accidentally sometimes in certain respects it may concur, but more frequently it is hurtful than helpful; as appeared

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="I"/> First then, as we said in the <HI>Call,</HI> so may we much more here. If the Grace of God be a necessary <HI>Qua∣lification</HI> to make one a <HI>true Christian,</HI> it must be a <HI>Qualification</HI> much more necessary to constitute a <HI>true Minister</HI> of <HI>Christianity.</HI> That Grace is necessa∣ry to make up a <HI>true Christian,</HI> I think will not be questioned;<NOTE PLACE="marg">God's Grace alone doth constitute a true and lawful <HI>Teacher.</HI></NOTE> since it is <HI>by Grace we are saved,</HI> Eph. 2.8. It is the Grace of God <HI>that teacheth us to deny Un∣godliness, and the Lusts of this World, and to live God∣lily and Righteously,</HI> Tit. 2.11. Yea, Christ saith ex∣presly, <HI>That without him we can do nothing,</HI> John 15.5. and the way whereby Christ helpeth, assisteth, and worketh with <HI>us,</HI> is by his <HI>Grace:</HI> Hence he saith to <HI>Paul, My</HI> Grace <HI>is sufficient for thee.</HI> A Christian without Grace, is indeed no Christian, but an Hy∣pocrite, and a false Pretender. Then I say, <HI>If Grace be necessary to a private Christian, far more to a Teacher among Christians, who must be as a Father and Instructor of others; seeing this Dignity is bestowed upon such as have attained a greater Measure than their Brethren. Even</HI> Nature <HI>it self may teach us, that there is more required in a Teacher, than in those that are Taught; and that the</HI> Master <HI>must be above and before the</HI> Scholar, <HI>in that Art or Science which he teach∣eth others. Since then Christianity cannot be truly enjoy∣ed, neither any Man denominated a Christian without the true</HI> Grace of God, <HI>therefore neither can any Man be a true and lawful Teacher of Christianity without it.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Proof <HI>II. Arg.</HI> Who first must be a Member of the Body, and then Life is re∣ceived, and Vertue from the Head.</NOTE><HI>Secondly</HI>; No Man can be a Minister of the Church of Christ, which is his <HI>Body,</HI> unless he be a Member of the <HI>Body,</HI> and receive of the Vertue and Life of the <HI>Head:</HI></P>
<PB N="301" REF="003129_0157_0FF0055D09658C50"/>
<P>But he that hath not true Grace, can neither be a Member of the <HI>Body,</HI> neither receive of that Life and Nourishment which comes from the <HI>Head:</HI></P>
<P>Therefore far less can he be a Minister to Edifie the Body.</P>
<P>That he cannot be a Minister, who is not a Mem∣ber, is evident; because who is not a Member, is shut out and cut off, and hath no place in the <HI>Body</HI>; whereas the Ministers are counted among the most eminent Members of the <HI>Body:</HI> But no Man can be a Member, unless he receive of the Virtue, Life and Nourishment of the <HI>Head:</HI> For the Members that receive not this Life and Nourishment, Decay and Wither, and then are cut off. And that every true Member doth thus receive Nourishment and Life from the <HI>Head,</HI> the Apostle expresly affirmeth, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.16. <HI>From whom the whole Body being fitly joyned to∣gether, and compacted by that which every joynt suppli∣eth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the Body, unto the Edify∣ing of it self in Love.</HI> Now this that thus is com∣municated, and which thus uniteth the whole, is no other than the Grace of God; and therefore the Apo∣stle in the same Chapter, <HI>ver.</HI> 7. saith, <HI>But unto every one of us is given</HI> Grace <HI>according to the measure of the Gift of Christ</HI>; and vers. 11. he sheweth how that <HI>by this</HI> Grace <HI>and</HI> Gift, <HI>both Apostles, Prophets, Evan∣gelists, Pastors and Teachers, are given for the Work of the Ministry, and Edifying of the Body of Christ.</HI> And certainly then, no Man destitute of Grace, is fit for this Work, seeing that all that Christ gives, are so <HI>qualified</HI>; and these that are not so <HI>qualified,</HI> are not given, nor sent of Christ; are not to be heard nor received, nor acknowledged as Mini∣sters of the Gospel; because his <HI>Sheep</HI> neither ought,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sheep of Christ, neither ought nor will hear the Stran∣ger▪ Voice.</NOTE> nor will hear the <HI>Voice of a Stranger.</HI> This is also, clear from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12. throughout; for the Apo∣stle in that Chapter, treating of the diversity of Gifts, and Members of the Body, sheweth how by
<PB N="302" REF="003129_0158_0FF0055EE4EF3B10"/>
the working of the same Spirit in different Manifestati∣ons or Measures, in the several Members of the Body, the whole Body is edifyed; saying, <HI>Verse</HI> 13. That <HI>we are all baptized by the One Spirit, into one Body</HI>; and then <HI>Verse</HI> 28. he numbers up the several Dispen∣sations thereof, which by God are set in the Church through the various working of his Spirit, for the Edification of the whole. Then, if there be no true Member of the Body, which is not thus bap∣tized by this Spirit, neither any thing that work∣eth to the edifying of it, but according to a Measure of Grace received from the Spirit; surely without Grace none ought to be admitted to work or la∣bour in the Body; because their Labour and Work without this Grace and Spirit, would be but in∣effectual.</P>
<P N="16">§. XVI. <HI>Thirdly</HI>; That this Grace and Gift is a <HI>necessary Qualification</HI> to a Minister, is clear from that of the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> 1 Pet. 4.10, 11. <HI>As eve∣ry Man hath received the</HI> Gift, <HI>even so minister the same one to another, as good Stewards of the manifold</HI> Grace of God. <HI>If any Man speak, let him speak as the</HI> Oracles of God: <HI>If any Man minister, let him do it as of the Ability which God giveth: That God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ; to whom be Praise and Dominion for ever.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The mini∣string must be by the Gift and Grace re∣ceived.</NOTE> <HI>Amen.</HI> From which it appears, That those that minister, must minister according to the Gift and Grace received; but they that have not such a Gift, cannot minister there∣unto. Secondly, <HI>As good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good Stew∣ardship, Of what? Of God's a∣bounding Grace, which is the Ability &amp; Steward∣ship re∣ceiv'd.</NOTE> But how can a Man be a good Stew∣ard of that which he hath not? Can ungod∣ly Men, that are not gracious themselves, be good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God? And there∣fore in the following Verses he makes an exclusive limitation of such, that are not thus furnished; saying, <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any man speak, let him speak as the Ora∣cles of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; and if any man minister, let him do it as of the Ability that</HI> God <HI>giveth</HI>: Which is as much
<PB N="303" REF="003129_0158_0FF0055EE4EF3B10"/>
as if he had said, They that cannot thus speak, and thus minister, ought not to do it: For this [<HI>If</HI>] denotes a necessary Condition. Now what this Ability is, is manifest by the former Words, to wit, the Gift received, and the Grace whereof they are Stewards; as by the immediate Context and Depen∣dency of the Words doth appear: Neither can it be understood of a meer natural Ability; because Man in this Condition is said <HI>not to know the things of God,</HI> and so he cannot minister them to others. And the following words shew this also, in that he immediately subjoineth, <HI>That God in all things may be glorified:</HI> But surely God is not glorified, but greatly dishonoured, when natural Men, from their meer natural Ability, meddle in Spiritu∣al Things, which they neither know nor under∣stand.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="IV"/> <HI>Fourthly</HI>; That Grace is a most necessary <HI>Qualifi∣cation</HI> for a Minister, appears by those Qualificati∣ons, which the Apostle expresly requires, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.2. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where he saith, <HI>A Bishop must be Blameless, Vigilant, Sober, of good Behaviour, apt to Teach, Patient, a lover of good Men; Just, Holy, Temperate, as the</HI> Steward of God, <HI>holding fast the faithful Word, as he hath been Taught.</HI> Upon the other hand, <HI>He must neither be given to Wine, nor a Striker, nor Covetous, nor Proud, nor Self-willed,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How can a <HI>Bishop</HI> have these <HI>Vertues</HI> without the <HI>Grace</HI> of <HI>God?</HI></NOTE> <HI>nor soon Angry,</HI> Now I ask, If it be not impos∣sible that a Man can have all these above-named Vertues, and be free of all these Evils, without the Grace of God? If then these Vertues (for the producing of which in a Man, Grace is ab∣solutely necessary) be necessary to make a true Minister of the Church of Christ, according to the Apostle's Judgment; surely Grace must be neces∣sary also.</P>

Moreover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All have <HI>God's Grace,</HI> which Calls to Righte∣ousness, but all are not so leaven'd into its Na∣ture, to bring forth Fruits a bla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eless, holy Life.</NOTE> we understand by Grace as a <HI>Qualification</HI> to a Minister, not the meer Measure of <HI>Light,</HI> as it is given to reprove, and call him to Righteousness; but we understand Grace, as it hath Converted the Soul, and Operateth Powerfully in it; as hereafter, concerning the <HI>Work of Ministers,</HI> will further appear. So we un∣derstand not Men simply, as having Grace in them, as a Seed, (which we indeed affirm <HI>All</HI> have in a measure) but we understand Men that are Graci∣ous, leavened by it into the Nature thereof; so as thereby to bring forth those good Fruits of a blamless Conversation, and of Justice, Holiness, Patience and Temperance, which the Apostle re∣quires as necessary in a true <HI>Christian Bishop</HI> and <HI>Minister.</HI></P>

But in opposition to all this Mass of For∣mality, and heap of Orders, Rules and Govern∣ments, we say, <HI>the Substance is chiefly to be sought after, and the Power, Vertue and Spirit, is to be known and waited for,</HI> which is One in all the different Names and Offices the Scripture makes use of; as appears by 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.4.

<P><HI>Lastly</HI>; An <HI>Apostle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Who is an <HI>Apostle</HI>?</NOTE> if we look to the Etymology of the word, signifies <HI>One that is sent</HI>; and in respect <HI>Every true Minister is sent</HI> of God, in so far he is an <HI>Apostle</HI>: Though the <HI>Twelve,</HI> because of their being <HI>specially sent of Christ,</HI> were therefore called <HI>Apostles,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>per Eminentiam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">They were not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted to such a Number.</NOTE> i. e. by way of Excel∣lency.

grown up in the Experience of the blessed Work of Truth in their Hearts, watch over and privately admonish the Young, care for the Widows, the Poor and Fatherless; and care and look that no∣thing he wanting, but that Peace, Love, Unity, Concord and Soundness be preserved in the Church of Christ; and this answers to the <HI>Deacons</HI> men∣tioned <HI>Acts</HI> 6.</P>
<P>That which we oppose, is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The distin∣ction of <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Laity</HI> not to be found in Scripture.</NOTE> the distinction of <HI>Laity</HI> and <HI>Clergy</HI> (which in the Scripture is not to be found) whereby none are admitted unto the Work of the Ministry, but such as are Educated at Schools on purpose, and instructed in <HI>Logick</HI> and <HI>Philosophy,</HI> &amp;c. and so are at their Apprenticeship to learn the <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Trade</HI> of Preaching, even as a Man learns any other Art; whereby all other ho∣nest Mechanick Men, who have not got this <HI>Hea∣thenish Art,</HI> are excluded from having this Priviledge. And so he that is a Scholar, thus bred up, must not have any honest Trade, whereby to get him a Livelihood, if he once intend for the Ministry; but he must see to get him a Place, and then he hath his <HI>set hire</HI> for a <HI>Livelihood</HI> to him.

Which in effect made them to cease to be the Ministry and Ministers of Christ, but only a Sha∣dow and vain Image of it: Which also decaying, was in some Ages so metamorphosed, that not only the Substance was lost, but the very Form wholly vitiated, altered and marred; that it may be far better said of the pretended Christian Church, as was disputed of <HI>Theseus</HI>'s Boat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The marred Church Compared to <HI>Thes∣us</HI>'s pieced Boat.</NOTE> (which by the piecing of many new pieces of Timber, was whol∣ly altered) <HI>whether indeed it were the same or ano∣ther?</HI> But in case that the first had been of <HI>Oak,</HI> and the last pieces put in but of rotten <HI>Fir,</HI> and that also the Form had been so far changed, as to be nothing like the first; I think it would have

And so by this means, the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s Command and Advice is slight∣ed, who exhorteth, 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.19.20. <HI>Not to quench the Spirit, nor despise Prophesying.</HI> And all this is done by Men pretending to be Christians, who glory, that the first <HI>Preachers</HI> and <HI>Propagators</HI> of their <HI>Religion</HI> were such kind of plain mechanick Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Both Prote∣sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts and Papists ex∣clude Me∣chanick Men from preaching, who great∣ly contri∣buted to the Refor∣mation.</NOTE> and il∣literate.

<P>By this it may appear, that as in <HI>Calling</HI> and <HI>Qua∣lifying,</HI> so in <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Praying,</HI> and the other particular steps of the Ministry; every true Minister is to know the Spirit of God, by its Vertue and Life, to accompany and assist him: But because this relates to <HI>Worship,</HI> I shall speak of it more largely in the next Proposition; which is concerning <HI>Worship.</HI>

The last thing to be considered, and inquired into, is, concerning the <HI>Maintenance</HI> of a Gospel-Minister: But Before I proceed, I judge it fit to speak some∣thing in short concerning the <HI>Preaching of Women</HI>; and to declare, what we hold in that matter.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Women's publick Preaching and Pray∣ing assert∣ed.</NOTE>Seeing <HI>Male and Female are one in Christ Jesus,</HI> and that he hath given his Spirit no less to <HI>one,</HI> than to the <HI>other</HI>; when God moveth by his Spirit <HI>in a Woman,</HI> we Judge it no ways unlawful for her to Preach in the Assemblies of God's People.

for him to receive, what is necessary and convenient. To prove this, I need not insist, for our Adversaries will readily grant it to us; for the thing we affirm is, that this is all that these Scripture Testimon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, relating to this thing, do grant; <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.6. 1 <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</HI> 9.11, 12, 13, 14. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.16. That which we then oppose in this matter, is; <HI>First,</HI> That it should be Constrained and Limited. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That it should be Superfluous, Chargeable and Sumptuous. And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The manifest Abuse thereof; of which I shall also briefly treat.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>first,</HI> our Adversaries are forced to re∣cur <MILESTONE N="I"/> to the Example of the <HI>Law</HI>; a Refuge they use in defending most of their Errors and Superstations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against Constrained <HI>Mainte∣nance</HI></NOTE> which are contrary to the Nature and Purity of the Gospel.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> They say, <HI>God appointed the</HI> Levites <HI>the Tithes; therefore they belong also to such, as Minister in Holy Things under the</HI> Gospel.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; All that can be gathered from this is, that as the <HI>Priests</HI> had a Maintenance allowed them under the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tithes</HI> were appointed for the <HI>Le∣vites,</HI> not for <HI>Gospel Preachers.</HI></NOTE> so also the <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Preachers</HI> under the Gospel; which is not denied: But the Comparison will not hold, that they should have the very same; since <HI>first,</HI> there is no express Gospel-Command for it, neither by Christ nor his Apostles. <HI>Secondly</HI>; The Parity doth no ways hold betwixt the <HI>Levites</HI> under the Law, and the <HI>Preachers</HI> under the Gospel; because the <HI>Levites</HI> were one of the Tribes of <HI>Israel,</HI> and so had a right to a part of the Inheritance of the Land, as well as the rest of their Brethren; and having none, had this allotted to them in lieu of it. Next, the Tenth of the <HI>Tithes</HI> was only allowed to the <HI>Priests</HI> that served at the Altar, the rest being for the <HI>Levites</HI>; and also to be put up in Store Houses, for entertaining of Widows and Strangers. But these <HI>Preachers,</HI> notwithstanding they inherit what they have by their Parents, as well as other Men, yet claim the
<PB N="330" REF="003129_0172_0FF0057F54E6BD10"/>
whole <HI>Tithes,</HI> allowing nothing either to Widow or Stranger. But as to the <HI>Tithes,</HI> I shall not insist; be∣cause divers have clearly and learnedly treated of it apart; and also divers Protestants do confess them not to be <HI>jure Divino</HI>: And the Parity, as to the <HI>quota,</HI> doth not hold; but only in general, as to the <HI>Obligation</HI> of a Maintenance. Which Mainte∣nance, tho' the Hearers be obliged to give, and fail of their Duty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 1. <HI>The</HI> Gospel freely to be preached, <HI>without so much a Year.</HI></NOTE> if they do not; yet that it ought neither to be stinted, nor yet forced, I prove; because Christ, when he sent forth his Apostles, said; <HI>Freely ye have received, freely give,</HI> Mat. 10.8. and they had liberty to receive Meat and Drink, from such as offered them, to supply their need. Which shews, that they were not to seek or require any thing by force, or to stint, or make a bargain before hand; as the Preachers, as well among Papists as Protestants, do in these days; who will not Preach to any, until they be sure first of so much a Year: But on the contrary, these were to do their Duty, and freely to com∣municate (as the Lord should order them) what they had received, without seeking or expecting a Reward.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nic. Arnol∣dus <HI>his an∣swer to</HI> Freely ye have re∣ceived, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>The answer of this, given by <HI>Nicolaus Arnoldus,</HI> Exercit. Theolg. Sect. 42, 43. is not to be for∣gotten; but indeed to be kept upon Record for a Perpetual Remembrance of him and his Brethren; for he frankly answers after this manner; <HI>We have not freely received, and therefore are not bound to give it freely.</HI> The Answer, I confess, is ingenuous and good: For if those that receive freely, are to give freely; it would seem to follow, by the Rule of Contraries, that those who receive not freely, ought not to give freely; and I shall grant it. Only they must grant me, that they preach not by and accord∣ing to the Gift and Grace of God received; nor can they be <HI>good Stewards of the manifold Grace of God,</HI> as every true Minister ought to be: Or then they

have gotten this Gift or Grace by Money,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Simon Ma∣gus.</NOTE> as <HI>Simon Magus</HI> would have been compassing it, since they think themselves not bound to give it without Mo∣ney again. But to be plain, I believe be intended not, that it was from the Gift or Grace of God they were to preach; but from their acquired Arts and Studies, which hath cost them much Labour, and also some Money at the <HI>University.</HI> And therefore, as he that puts his Stock into the publick Bank, expects Interest again; so these Scholars, having spent some Money in Learning the Art of Preaching, think they may boldly say, <HI>they have it not freely</HI>; for it hath cost them both Money and Pains, and therefore they expect both Money and Ease again. And therefore as <HI>Arnoldus</HI> gets Money for Teaching his young Students the <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Trade</HI> of Preaching; so he intends they should be payed, before they give it again to others. It was of old said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All things are set to sale at <HI>Rome,</HI> To <HI>Franequer</HI> apply'd.</NOTE> <HI>Omnia venalia Romae,</HI> i. e. <HI>All things are set to sale at</HI> Rome; but now the same Proverb may be applied to <HI>Fra∣nequer:</HI> And therefore <HI>Arnoldus</HI>'s Students, when they go about to Preach, may safely seek and re∣quire hereby, telling their Hearers their Master's Maxim; <HI>Nos gratés non accepimus, ergo neque gratis dare tenemur.</HI> But then they may answer again, that they find them and their Master to be none of his Ministers; who, when he sent forth his Dis∣ciples, gave them this Command, <HI>Freely ye have re∣ceived, freely give</HI>; and therefore we will have none of your teaching, because we perceive you to be of the number of those,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 56.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> <HI>that look for their</HI> Gain <HI>from their Quarter.</HI></P>
<P N="29">§. XXIX. <HI>Secondly</HI>; The Scripture-Testimonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 2.</NOTE> that urge this, are in the same nature of those, that press <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Liberality</HI> towards the Poor, and command <HI>Hospitality,</HI> &amp;c.

the Giver, and not in the matter of the thing given; as Christ sheweth in the Example of the Widow's <HI>Mite.</HI> So that, tho' there be an Obligation upon Christians, to minister of outward things to their Ministers; yet there can be no definition of the quantity, but by the Giver's own consent; and a little from one may more truly fulfil the Obligation, than a great deal from another. And therefore as Acts of <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Hospitality</HI> can neither be limited nor forced; so neither can this.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If it be Objected, <HI>That Ministers may and ought to exhort, perswade, yea, and earnestly press</HI> Christians <HI>(if they find them defective therein) to</HI> Acts of Charity and Hospitality, <HI>and so may they do also to the giving of</HI> Maintenance.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; All this saith nothing for a <HI>stinted</HI> and <HI>forced</HI> Maintenance, for which there cannot so much as the shew of one solid Argument be brought from Scripture. I confess, Ministers may use Exhorta∣tion in this, as much as in any other case, even as the Apostle did to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> shewing them their Duty:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Paul</HI>'s La∣bour was, that the <HI>Gospel</HI> might be without Charge.</NOTE> But it were fit for Ministers, that so do, that their Testimony might have the more weight, and be the freer of all suspition of Cove∣tousness and Self-interest, that they might be able to say truly, in the fight of God, that which the same Apostle subjoyns upon the same occasion; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.15, 16, 17, 18. <HI>But I have used none of these things. Neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: For it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. For though I preach the Gospel, I have nothing to glory of; for necessity is laid upon me, yea, Wo is unto me, if I preach not the Gospel. For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, a dispensation of the Gospel is committed unto me. What is my Reward then? Verily, that when I preach the Gospel, I may make the Gospel of Christ without Charge, that I abuse not my power in the Gospel.</HI></P>
<PB N="333" REF="003129_0173_0FF005824CFAA1C0"/>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 3.</NOTE> As there is neither Precept nor Exam∣ple for this forced and stinted Maintenance in the Scripture; so the Apostle in his solemn <HI>farewel</HI> to the Pastors and Elders of the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Paul</HI> Cover∣ed no Body's Silver or Gold.</NOTE> guards them against it, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.33, 34, 35. But if the thing had been either lawful or practised, he would rather have exhorted them to be <HI>content</HI> with their stinted Hire, and not to covet more; whereas he sheweth them, <HI>First,</HI> by his own Ex∣ample, that they were not to <HI>covet or expect</HI> any Man's Silver or Gold. <HI>Secondly,</HI> that they ought to <HI>work with their Hands</HI> for an honest Livelihood, as he had done. And <HI>Lastly,</HI> he exhorts them so to do from the words of Christ, <HI>Because it is a more blessed thing to give, than to receive</HI>; shewing that it is so far from a thing that a true Minister ought to aim at, or expect, that it is rather a burthen to a true Minister, and cross to him, to be brought upon necessity so to lack.</P>
<P N="30">§. XXX. <HI>Fourthly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reason 4.</NOTE> If a forced and stinted Main∣tenance were to be supposed, it would make the Ministers of Christ just one with those Hirelings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No <HI>Hireling</HI> fitting the Gospel of Christ.</NOTE> whom the Prophet cryed out against. For cer∣tainly, if a Man make a Bargain to Preach to Peo∣ple for so much a Year, so as to refuse to Preach, unless he have it; and seek to force the People to give it by Violence; it cannot be denied, that such a one preached for Hire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mic. 3.5.</NOTE> and so <HI>looks for his</HI> Gain <HI>from his Quarter</HI>; yea, and <HI>prepares</HI> War <HI>against such as put not into his mouth:</HI> But this is the particular special Mark of a false Prophet, and an Hireling, and therefore can no ways belong to a true Mini∣ster of Christ.</P>
<P>Next, that a Superfluous Maintenance, that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Moderate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ants</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI> exclaim a∣gainst the Excess of the <HI>Cler∣gy</HI>'s Re∣venues</NOTE> more than in reason is needful, ought not to be received by Christian Ministers, will not need much Proof. seeing the more Moderate and Sober both among Papists and Protestants, readily confess it, who with one Voice exclaim against the <HI>ex∣cessive
<PB N="334" REF="003129_0174_0FF005842E0883F0"/>
Revenues</HI> of the Clergy: And that it may not want a Proof from Scripture, what can be more plain, than that of the Apostle to <HI>Timo∣thy?</HI> 1 Tim. 6.7, 8, 9, 10. where he both shews wherewith we ought to be Content, and also the hazzard of such as look after more; and indeed, since that very Obligation of giving Maintenance to a Minister, is founded upon their Need, and such as have opportunity to Work, are commended ra∣ther in not Receiving, than in Receiving; it can no ways be supposed lawful for them to receive more than is sufficient. And indeed, were they truly Pious and Right, tho' Necessitous, they would rather incline to take too little, than be gaping after too much.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="II"/> §. XXXI. Now, that there is great excess and abuse hereof among Christians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Excess of the <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Bishops</HI> Revenues.</NOTE> the vast Revenues which the Bishops and Priests have, both Papist and Protestant, do declare; since I Judge it may be said without any <HI>Hyperbole,</HI> that some particular Persons have more paid them Yearly, than Christ and his Apostles made use of in their whole Life-time; who yet wanted not what was needful as to the outward Man, and no doubt deserved it far better, than those that enjoy that fulness. But it is manifest, these Bishops and Priests <HI>love their far</HI> Benefices, <HI>and the Pleasure and Honour that at∣tends them, so well, that they purpose neither to follow Christ, nor his Apostles Example or Advice in this matter.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> But it's usually <HI>objected,</HI> That <HI>Christians are be∣come so hard hearted, and generally so little heed spi∣ritual Things, that if Ministers had not a</HI> settled <HI>and</HI> stinted Maintenance, <HI>secured them by Law, they and their Families might Starve for want of Bread.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; This Objection might have some weight, as to a carnal Ministry, made up of natu∣ral Men, who have no Life, Power, nor Vertue with them; and so may insinuate some need of such a Main∣tenance
<PB N="335" REF="003129_0174_0FF005842E0883F0"/>
for such a Ministry: But it saith nothing as to such as are called and sent of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They want∣ed nothing, whom God sent; they Laboured with their Hands.</NOTE> <HI>who sends no Man a way faring upon his own charges</HI>; and so go forth in the Authority and Power of God, to turn Peo∣ple from Darkness to Light, for such can trust to him that sendeth them, knowing that he requireth nothing of any, but what he giveth Power to perform; and so when they return, if he inquire, can say, <HI>they wanted nothing.</HI> And such also when they stay in a place (being immediately furnished by God, and not needing to Borrow and Steal what they Preach from Books, and take up their time that way) fall a working at their lawful Imployments, and labour with their Hands, as <HI>Paul</HI> did, when he gathered the Church at <HI>Corinth.</HI> And indeed, if this Objection had any weight, the Apostles and primitive Pastors should never have gone forth to Convert the Nations, for fear of Want. Doth not the Doctrine of Christ teach us to Venture all, and Part with all, to serve God? Can they then be accounted Ministers of Christ, who are afraid to preach him, lest they get not Money for it; or will not do it, until they be sure of their Payment? What serves the Ministry for, but to Perfect the Saints, and so to Convert them from that hard-heartedness?</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> But thou wilt say, <HI>I have laboured and preached to them, and they are hard-hearted still, and will not give me any thing.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> Then surely thou hast either not been sent to them of God, and so thy Ministry and Preaching hath not been among them in the Power, Virtue, and Life of Christ, and so thou deservest nothing; or else they have rejected thy Testimony, and so are not worthy; and from such thou oughtest not to expect, yea, nor yet receive any thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat. 10.14.</HI> If they re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thy Test<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mony, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from off thy Feet.</NOTE> if they would give thee; but thou oughtest to <HI>shake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Dust from thy Feet,</HI> and leave them. And how frivolous this Objection is, appears, in that in the
<PB N="336" REF="003129_0175_0FF00586A3173EF0"/>
darkest and most superstitious Times, the Priests Revenues increased most, and they were most rich∣ly rewarded, though they deserved least. So that he that is truly sent of God, as he needs not, so neither will he be afraid of Want, so long as he serves so good a Master; neither will he ever for∣bear to do his Work for that Cause. And in∣deed such as make this Objection, shew truly that they <HI>serve not the Lord Christ,</HI> but their own Belly, and that makes them so anxious for want of Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="III"/> §. XXXII. But <HI>Lastly,</HI> as to the Abuses of this kind of Maintenance; indeed he, that would go through them all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The many <HI>a u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Priests <HI>Mainte∣nance</HI> brings.</NOTE> tho' he did it passingly, might make of it alone an huge Volume, they are so great and numerous. For this Abuse, as others, crept in with the Apostasie; there being nothing of this in the primitive Time: Then the Ministers claimed no Tithes, neither sought they a stinted or forced Maintenance; but such as wanted, had their Necessity supplied by the Church; and others wrought with their Hands. But the Persecutions being over, and the Emperors and Princes coming under the Name of Christians, the Zeal of those great Men was quickly abused by the Coveteousness of the Clergy, who soon learned to change their Cottages with the Palaces of Princes; and rested not, until by degrees some of them came to be Princes themselves, nothing Inferiour to them in Splendor, Luxury and Magnificence; a method of living, that honest <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> the <HI>Fisher men,</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> the <HI>Tent-maker,</HI> never coveted; and per∣haps as little imagined, that Men pretending to be their Successors, should have arrived to these things. And so soon as the Bishops were thus sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and constitute forgetting the Life and Work of a Christian, they went usually by the Ears together, about the Precedency and Revenues, each covering the Chiefest and Fattest Benefice.
<PB N="337" REF="003129_0175_0FF00586A3173EF0"/>
It is also to be regretted to think, how soon this Mischief crept in among Protestants;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Prote∣stants</HI> ha∣ving for∣saken the <HI>Pope,</HI> yet would not forsake the rich <HI>Popish Revenues.</HI></NOTE> who had scar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well appeared, when the Clergy among them began to speak at the old rate, and shew, that tho' they had forsaken the Bishop of <HI>Rome,</HI> they were not resolved to part with their old Benefices: And therefore so soon as any Princes or States shook off the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Authority, and so demolished the <HI>Abbies, Nunneries,</HI> and other Monuments of Super∣stition, the reformed Clergy began presently to cry out to the Magistrates, to beware of medling with the Churches Patrimony; several exclaim∣ing against making a lawful Use of those vast Revenues that had been superstitiously bestow∣ed upon the Church (so called) to the Good and Benefit of the Common-wealth, as no less than Sacriledge.</P>
<P>But by keeping up of this kind of Maintenance for the Ministry, and Clergy-men, so called,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1.</HI> The <HI>Cler∣gy</HI>'s Cove∣tousness.</NOTE> their is first a Bait laid for <HI>Covetousness, which is Idola∣try,</HI> and of all things most Hurtful; so that for Covetousness sake, many being led by the desire of filthy Lucre, do apply themselves to be Ministers, that they may get a Livelyhood by it. If a Man have several Children, he will allot one of them to be a Minister, which if he can get it to be, he reckons it as Good as a Patrimony; so that a set Benefice hath always a good many Expectants, and then what Bribing, what Courting, what In∣dustry, and shameful Actions, are used to acquire these things, is too openly known, and needs not to be proved.</P>
<P>The Scandal that here-through is raised among Christians, is so manifest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Greedy <HI>Kirk,</HI> a Pro∣verb.</NOTE> that it is become a Pro∣verb, That <HI>the Kirk is always greedy.</HI> Whereby the Gift and Grace of God being neglected, they have for the most part no other Motive or Rule, in applying themselves to one Church more than another, but the greater Benefice. For tho' they

hypocritically pretend, at their accepting of, and entring into their Church, that they have nothing before them, but the Glory of God, and the Salva∣tion of Souls; yet if a richer Benefice offer it self, they presently find it more for God's Glory, to remove from the first, and go thither. And thus they make no difficulty often to change, while notwithstanding they accuse us, that we allow Ministers to go from Place to Place, and not to be tied to one Place; but we allow this, not for the gaining of Money, but as moved of God. For if a Minister be called to minister in a particular Place, he ought not to leave it, except God call him from it, and then he ought to obey: For we make the Will of God <HI>inwardly revealed,</HI> and not the Love of Money, and more Gain, the Ground of removing.</P>

<P>All true and acceptable <HI>Worship to God</HI> is offered in the Inward and Immediate moving and drawing of his own <HI>Spirit,</HI> which is neither limited to Places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the true Wor∣ship is that is accepta∣ble to God.</NOTE> Times, nor Persons.

it in our own <HI>Will, where</HI> and <HI>when</HI> we will; but <HI>where</HI> and <HI>when</HI> we are moved thereunto by the stirring and secret Inspiration of the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> in our Hearts; which God heareth and accepteth of, and is never wanting to move us thereunto, when need is; of which he himself is the alone proper Judge. All other <HI>Worship</HI> then, both Praises, Prayers or Preach∣ings, which Man sets about in his own will, and at his own appointment, which he can both begin and end at his pleasure, do, or leave undone, as himself seeth meet, whether they be a <HI>prescribed Form,</HI> as a <HI>Li∣turgy,</HI> &amp;c. or <HI>Prayers</HI> conceived <HI>extempore</HI> by the natural strength and faculty of the Mind, they are all but <HI>Superstition,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Superstition and Will-Worship.</NOTE> <HI>Will-Worship,</HI> and <HI>abominable Idolatry</HI> in the sight of God, which are now to be de∣nied and rejected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Idolatry.</NOTE> and separated from, in this day of his <HI>Spiritual Arising.</HI> However, it might have pleased him <HI>(who winked at the Times of Ignorance,</HI> with a respect to the <HI>Simplicity</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI> of some, and of his own innocent <HI>Seed,</HI> which lay as it were buried <HI>in the Hearts</HI> of Men under that <HI>Mass of Super∣stition)</HI> to <HI>blow upon the dead and dry Bones,</HI> and to raise some Breathings of his own, and answer them; and that until the <HI>Day</HI> should more clearly <HI>dawn</HI> and <HI>break forth.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">§. I. THe <HI>Duty of Man</HI> towards God lieth chiefly in these Two Generals, 1. <HI>In an holy Con∣formity to the pure Law and Light of God, so as both to forsake the Evil, and be found in the practice of those perpetual and moral Precepts of Righteousness and Equity.</HI> And 2. <HI>In rendering that Reverence, Honour and Ado∣ration to God, that he requires and demands of us</HI>; which is comprehended under <HI>Worship.</HI> Of the <HI>former</HI> we have already spoken, as also of the different Rela∣tions of <HI>Christians,</HI> as they are distinguished by the several Measures of Grace received, and given to every one; and in that respect have their several Offices in the <HI>Body of Christ,</HI> which is the <HI>Church.</HI>
<PB N="345" REF="003129_0179_0FF0058FB4374F40"/>
Now I come to speak of <HI>Worship,</HI> or of those Acts, whether private or publick, general or particular, whereby Man renders to God that part of his Duty, which relates immediately to him: And as <HI>Obedience is better than Sacrifice,</HI> so neither is any Sacrifice <HI>acceptable,</HI> but that which is done accord∣ing to the Will of him, to whom it is <HI>offered.</HI> But Men, finding it easier to <HI>sacrifice</HI> in their own Wills, than obey God's Will, have heaped up Sacrifices without Obedience; and thinking to deceive God, as they do one another, give him a shew of Reverence, Honour and Worship, while they are both inwardly estranged and alienated from his Holy and Righte∣ous Life, and wholly strangers to the pure Breathings of his Spirit, in which the acceptable Sacrifice and Worship is only offered up.<NOTE PLACE="marg">True Wor∣ship and Duty to God-warde corrupted.</NOTE> Hence it is that there is not any thing relating to Man's Duty towards God, which among all sorts of People hath been more vitiated, and in which the Devil hath more prevailed, than in abusing Man's Mind concerning this thing: And as among many other, so among those called Christians, nothing hath been more out of order, and more corrupted, as some Papists, and all Protestants, do acknowledge. As I freely ap∣prove whatsoever the Protestants have Reformed from Papists in this respect; so I meddle not at this time with their Controvesies about it: Only it suffices me, with them, to deny, as no part of the true Worship of God, that abominable Superstition and Idolatry, the <HI>Popish Mass,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Popish Mass (Ido∣latry)</HI> de∣nied, with all their Trumpery.</NOTE> the <HI>Adoration of Saints</HI> and <HI>Angels,</HI> the <HI>Veneration of Relicks,</HI> the <HI>Visitation of Sepulchres,</HI> and all those other Superstitious Ce∣remonies, Confraternities, and endless Pilgrimages of the <HI>Romish</HI> Synagogue. Which all may suffice to evince to Protestants, that <HI>Antichrist</HI> hath wrought more in this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">If <HI>Prote∣stants</HI> have made a <HI>perfect Re∣formation?</HI></NOTE> than in any other part of the Christian Religion; and so it concerns them narrowly to con∣sider, whether herein they have made a clear and perfect Reformation; as to which stands the Con∣trovesie
<PB N="346" REF="003129_0180_0FF00591B334B038"/>
betwixt them and us. For we find many of the Branches lopp'd off by them, but the Root yet remaining; to wit, a Worship acted in and from Man's Will and Spirit, and not by and from the Spirit of God: For the true Christian and Spiritual Worship of God hath been so early lost, and Man's Wisdom and Will hath so quickly and throughly mixed it self herein; that both the <HI>Apostasie</HI> in this respect hath been greatest, and the <HI>Reformation</HI> here-from, as to the Evil Root, most difficult. Therefore let not the Reader suddenly stumble at the account of our Proposition in this matter; but hear us patiently in this respect Explain our selves, and I hope (by the assistance of God) to make it appear, that tho' our manner of Speaking and Doctrine seem most singu∣lar and different from all other sorts of Christians; yet it is most according to the purest Christian Reli∣gion, and indeed most needful to be observed and followed. And that there be no ground of mistake (for that I was necessitated to speak in few words, and therefore more obscurely and dubiously, in the Proposition it self) it is fit in the first place to ex∣plain and hold forth our Sense, and clear the State of the Controversie.</P>
<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I.</HI> What <HI>Wor∣ship</HI> here is spoken of.</NOTE>§. II. And <HI>first,</HI> let it be considered, That what is here affirmed, is spoken of the Worship of God in Gospel-Times, and not of the Worship that was un∣der or before the Law: For the particular Com∣mands of God to Men <HI>then,</HI> are not sufficient to Authorize us <HI>now,</HI> to do the same things; else we might be supposed at present acceptably to offer Sacrifice, as they did, which all acknowledge to be ceased. So that what might have been both Commendable and Acceptable under the <HI>Law,</HI> may justly now be charged with Superstition, yea, and Idolatry. So that impertinently, in this respect, doth <HI>Arnoldus</HI> rage against this <HI>Proposition, [Exercit. Theolog.</HI> sect. 44.] saying; <HI>That I deny all publick Wor∣ship, and that, according to me, such as in</HI> Enoch'<HI>s time
<PB N="347" REF="003129_0180_0FF00591B334B038"/>
publickly began to call upon the Name of the Lord; and such as at the Command of God went twice up to</HI> Jeru∣salem <HI>to worship; and that</HI> Anna, Simeon, Mary, <HI>&amp;c. were Idolaters, because they used the publick Worship of these times:</HI> Such a Consequence is most imperti∣nent, and no less foolish and absurd, than if I should infer from <HI>Paul</HI>'s Expostulating with the <HI>Galatians,</HI> for their returning to the <HI>Jewish Ceremonies</HI>; that he therefore condemned <HI>Moses</HI> and all the <HI>Prophets,</HI> as foolish and ignorant, because they used those things: The forward Man, not heeding the dif∣ferent Dispensation of times, ran into this imper∣tinency. Tho' a Spiritual Worship might have been, and no doubt was practised by many under the Law, in great Simplicity; yet will it not follow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies under the Law were not Essen∣tial to true <HI>Worship.</HI></NOTE> that it were no Superstition to use all those Ceremonies that they used, which were by God dispensed to the <HI>Jews,</HI> not as being Essential to true Worship, or necessary as of themselves for transmitting and entertaining an holy Fellowship betwixt him and his People; but in Condesension to them, who were inclinable to Idolatry. Albeit then in this, as in most other things, the Substance was enjoyed under the Law, by such as were Spiritual indeed; yet was it vailed and surrounded with many Rites and Cere∣monies, which is no ways lawful for us to use now, under the Gospel.</P>

are clothed with this outward Tabernacle, there is a necessity to the entertaining of a Joynt and Vi∣sible Fellowship, and bearing of an outward Testi∣mony for God, and seeing of the Faces of one another, that we concur with our Persons, as well as Spirits: To be accompanied with that inward Love and Unity of Spirit, doth greatly tend to encourage and refresh the Saints.</P>

<P N="4">§. IV. We,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the</HI> First Day of the Week, <HI>com∣monly call∣ed the</HI> Lord's Day.</NOTE> not seeing any ground in Scripture for it, cannot be so Superstitious, as to believe, that either the <HI>Jewish Sabbath</HI> now continues, or that the <HI>First Day of the Week</HI> is the <HI>Anti type</HI> there∣of, or the true <HI>Christian Sabbath</HI>; which, with <HI>Cal∣vin,</HI> we believe to have a more Spiritual Sense: And therefore we know no Moral Obligation by the <HI>Fourth Command,</HI> or elsewhere, to keep the <HI>First Day of the Week</HI> more than any other, or any Holi∣ness inherent in it.

been, and are, in this matter, our Enemies in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who have used all means to hinder our Assembling together to Worship God, may bear witness) and when Assembled, the great Work of one and all ought to be to wait upon God; and returning out of their own Thoughts and Imagi∣nations, to feel the Lord's Presence, and know a <HI>gathering into his Name</HI> indeed, where he is <HI>in the midst,</HI> according to his promise. And as every one is thus gathered, and so met together inwardly in their Spirits, as well as outwardly in their Persons; there the secret Power and Vertue of Life is known to re∣fresh the Soul, and the pure Motions and Breathings of God's Spirit are felt to arise; from which, as Words of Declaration, Prayers or Praises arise, the acceptable Worship is known, which Edifies the Church, and is well pleasing to God. And no Man here limits the the Spirit of God, nor bringeth forth his own conned and gathered Stuff; but every one puts that forth, which the Lord puts into their Hearts: And it's uttered forth not in Man's Will and Wisdom, but <HI>in the Evidence and Demonstration of the Spirit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its glorious <HI>Dispensa∣tion.</HI></NOTE> <HI>and of Power.</HI> Yea, tho' there be not a word spoken, yet is the true Spi∣ritual Worship performed, and the Body of Christ edified; yea, it may, and hath often fallen out among us, that divers Meetings have past without one word; and yet our Souls have been greatly edified and refreshed, and our Hearts wonderfully overcome with the secret Sense of God's Power and Spirit, which without words hath been mi∣nistred from one Vessel to another. This is in∣deed strange and incredible, to the meer natural and carnally-minded Man, who will be apt to judge all time lost, where there is not something spoken, that's obvious to the outward Senses; and therefore I shall insist a little upon this Subject, as one that can speak from a certain Experience, and not by meet Hearsay, of this wonderful and

<P N="7">§. VII. As there can be nothing more opposite to the natural Will and Wisdom of Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The silent waiting upon God obtained.</NOTE> than this <HI>silent waiting upon God</HI>; so neither can it be obtain∣ed, nor rightly comprehended by Man, but as he layeth down his own Wisdom and Will, so as to be content to be throughly subject to God. And therefore it was not preached, nor can be so pra∣ctised, but by such as find no outward Ceremony, no Observations, no Words; yea, not the best and purest Words, even the words of Scripture, able to satisfie their weary and afflicted Souls: Be∣cause where all these may be, the Life, Power, and Virtue, which make such things effectual, may be wanting. Such, I say, were necessitated to cease from all outwards, and to be silent before the Lord; and being directed to that inward Princi∣ple of Life and Light in themselves, as the most excellent Teacher,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.20.</NOTE> which <HI>can never be removed into a Corner,</HI> came thereby to be learned to wait upon God in the measure of Life and Grace received from him, and to cease from their own forward Words and Actings, in the natural Willing and Comprehension, and feel after this inward Seed of Life; that, as it moveth, they may move with it, and be acted by its Power, and influenced, whether to Pray, Preach or Sing. And so from this Principle of Man's being Silent, and not act∣ing in the things of God, of himself, until thus acted by God's <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Grace in the Heart,</HI> did naturally spring that manner of sitting Silent to∣gether, and waiting together upon the Lord.

own Wills, but each made it their work to retire inwardly to the Measure of Grace in themselves, not being only Silent as to Words, but even ab∣staining from all their own Thoughts, Imagina∣tions and Desires; so watching in a holy Depen∣dance upon the Lord, and meeting together not only outwardly in one place, but thus inwardly in <HI>One Spirit</HI> and in <HI>One Name of Jesus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What it is to meet in <HI>Jesus</HI> Name</NOTE> which is his Power and Vertue; they come thereby to en∣joy and feel the arisings of this Life; which as it prevails in each particular, becomes as a Flood of Refreshment, and overspreads the whole Meet∣ing: For Man, and Man's Part and Wisdom, being denied and chained down in every Individual, and God exalted, and his Grace in Dominion in the Heart; thus his <HI>Name</HI> comes to be <HI>One</HI> in <HI>all,</HI> and his Glory breaks forth, and covers all; and there is such a holy Awe and Reverence upon every Soul, that if the natural part should arise in any, or the wise part, or what is not one with the Life, it would presently be chained down, and judged out. And when any are through the breaking forth of this Power, constrained to utter a Sentence of Exhortation or Praise or to Breathe to the Lord in Prayer, then all are sensible of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 27. verse 19.</NOTE> for the same Life <HI>in</HI> them answers to it, <HI>as in Water, Face answereth to Face.</HI> This is that <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>spiritual Worship,</HI> which the World neither knoweth nor understandeth, which the <HI>Vulture's</HI> Eye seeth not into.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Advan∣tages of</HI> Silent Meetings.</NOTE> Yet many and great are the Advantages which my Soul, with many others, hath tasted of hereby, and which would be found of all such as would seriously apply themselves hereun∣to: For when People are gathered thus together, not meerly to hear Men, nor depend upon them; but <HI>all are inwardly taught to stay their Minds upon the Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 10.20. and 26.3.</NOTE> <HI>and wait for his Appearance in their Hearts</HI>; thereby the forward working of the Spirit of Man is stayed and hindred from mixing it self

with the Worship of God; and the Form of this Worship is so naked and void of all outward and worldly Splendor, that all occasion for Man's Wisdom to be excercised in that Superstition and Idolatry, hath no lodging here; and so there be∣ing also an inward quietness and retiredness of Mind, the Witness of God ariseth <HI>in the Heart,</HI> and the Light of Christ shineth, whereby the Soul com∣eth to see its own Condition. And there being many joyned together in the same work, there is an Inward Travel and Wrestling; and also, as the Measure of Grace is abode in, an overcoming of the Power and Spirit of Darkness; and thus we are often greatly strengthened and renewed in the Spirits of our Minds, without a word; and we enjoy and possess the <HI>Holy Fellowship</HI> and <HI>Com∣munion of the Body and Blood of Christ,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4.23.</NOTE> by which our inward Man is nourished and fed: Which makes us not to dote upon outward <HI>Water</HI> and <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> in our spiritual Things.

Such is the evident cer∣tanity of that divine Strength, that is communicat∣cated by thus meeting together and waiting in Silence upon God, that sometimes when one hath come in, that hath been unwatchful, and wan∣dring in his Mind, or suddenly out of the hurry of outward business, and so not inwardly gathered with the rest; so soon as he retires himself inward∣ly, this Power being in a good measure raised in the whole Meeting, will suddenly lay hold upon his Spirit, and wonderfully help to raise up the Good in him, and beget him into the sense of the

Yea, if it fall out, that several met together be straying in their Minds, tho' outwardly silent, and so wandering from the measure of Grace in themselves (which, through the working of the Enemy, and negligence of some, may fall out) if either one come in, or may be in, who is watchful, and in whom the <HI>Life</HI> is raised in a great measure; as that one keeps his place, he will feel a secret Travel for the rest, in a Sympa∣thy with the <HI>Seed,</HI> which is oppressed in the other, and keep from arising by their Thoughts and Wan∣drings.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A secret Travel one for another in Silent Meetings.</NOTE> And as such a faithful one waits in the <HI>Light</HI> and keeps in this <HI>Divine Work,</HI> God often∣times answers the secret Travel and Breathings of his own <HI>Seed,</HI> through such a one; so that the rest will find themselves <HI>secretly smitten,</HI> without words: and that one will be as a <HI>Midwife,</HI> through the se∣cret travel of his Soul, to bring forth the Life in them; just as a little Water thrown into a Pump, brings up the rest; whereby Life will come to be raised in all, and the vain Imaginations brought down: And such a one is felt by the rest, to mini∣ster Life unto them without words.

up to the Redeeming of his Soul. And this we often bear witness of; so as we had hereby fre∣quent occasion, in this respect since God hath ga∣thered us to be a People, to renew this old saying of many, <HI>Is</HI> Saul <HI>also among the Prophets</HI>?<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.12</NOTE> For not a few have come to be Convinced of the Truth after this manner: Of which I my self, in a part, am a true Witness; who not by strength of Argu∣ments, or by a particular Disquisition of each Do∣ctrine, and Convincement of my Understanding thereby, came to receive and bear witness of the Truth; but by being secretly Reached by this <HI>Life.</HI> For when I came into the <HI>silent Assemblies</HI> of God's People, I felt a <HI>secret Power</HI> among them, which touched my Heart; and as I gave way unto it, I found the Evil weakning in me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true Convince∣ment.</NOTE> and the Good raised up; and so I became thus knit and united un∣to them, hungring more and more after the In∣crease of this Power and Life, whereby I might feel my self perfectly Redeemed.

<P N="8"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Work and Wor∣ship in our Meetings.</NOTE>§. VIII. Our <HI>Work</HI> then and <HI>Worship</HI> is, when we meet together, for every one to <HI>watch and wait upon God in themselves,</HI> and to be <HI>gathered</HI> from all Visi∣bles thereinto. And as every one is thus stated, they come to find the Good arise over the Evil, and the Pure over the Impure, in which God reveals him∣self, and draweth near to every Individual; and so he in the midst in the General. Whereby each not only partakes of the particular Refreshment and Strength which comes from the Good in himself, but is a sharer of the whole Body, as being a li∣ving Member of the Body, having a Joint Fellow∣ship and Communion with all. And as this Wor∣ship is stedfastly preached, and kept to, it becomes easie; tho' it be very hard at first to the Natural Man, whose roving Imaginations, and running Worldly Desires are not so easily brought to silence. And therefore the Lord often-times, when any turn towards him, and have true desires thus to wait upon him, and find great difficulty through the unstayedness of their Minds, doth in condescen∣tion and compassion cause his Power to break forth in a more strong and powerful manner. And when the Mind sinks down, and waits for the Appearance of <HI>Life,</HI> and that the Power of Darkness in the Soul wrestles and works against it, then the good Seed, as it ariseth, will be found to work as Phy∣sick in the Soul; especially if such a weak one be in the Assembly of divers others, in whom the Life is arisen in greater dominion: And through the contrary workings of the Power of Darkness, there will be found an inward striving in the Soul,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> strove in <HI>Rebeccah</HI>'s Womb.</NOTE> as really in the Mystery, as ever <HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> strove in <HI>Rebe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kah</HI>'s Womb. And from this Inward Tra∣vel, while the <HI>Darkness</HI> seeks to obscure the <HI>Light,</HI> and the <HI>Light</HI> breaks through the <HI>Darkness,</HI> (which
<PB N="359" REF="003129_0186_0FF005A1B500FC28"/>
always it will do, if the Soul give not its strength to the Darkness) there will be such a painful Travel found in the Soul, that will even work upon the out∣ward Man; so that oftentimes, through the working thereof, the Body will be greatly shaken; and many Groans, and Sighs, and Tears, even as the pangs of a Woman in Travel, will lay hold upon it; yea, and this not only as to one, but when the Enemy (who, when the Children of God assemble together, is not wanting to be present, to see if he can lett their Comfort) hath prevailed in any measure in a whole Meeting, and strongly worketh against it, by spreading and propagating his dark Power, and by drawing out the Minds of such as are met, from the Life in them; as they come to be sensible of this Power of his, that Works against them, and to wrestle with it by the <HI>Armour of Light,</HI> sometimes the Power of God will break forth into a whole Meeting; and there will be such an inward Travel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Travel <HI>crown'd</HI> with a vi∣ctorious Song.</NOTE> while each is seeking to overcome the Evil in them∣selves, that by the strong contrary workings of these opposite Powers (like the going of two contrary Tides) every Individual will be strongly exercised, as in a Day of Battle; and thereby Trembling and a Motion of Body will be upon most, if not upon all: Which, as the Power of Truth prevails, will from Pangs and Groans, end with a <HI>sweet sound of Thanks∣giving</HI> and <HI>Praise.</HI> And from this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Name of <HI>Quakers,</HI> whence it sprung.</NOTE> the Name of <HI>Quakers,</HI> i. e. <HI>Tremblers,</HI> was first Reproachfully cast upon us; which, tho' it be none of our choosing, yet in this respect we are not ashamed of it; but have rather reason to rejoyce therefore, even that we are sensible of this Power, that hath oftentimes laid hold upon our Adversaries, and made them yield unto us, and joyn with us, and confess to the Truth, be∣fore they had any distinct or discursive Knowledge of our <HI>Doctrine</HI>; so that sometimes many at one Meeting have been thus Convinced: And this Power would sometimes also reach to, and wonderfully

Yet in Condesension to, and for the sake of such as may be the more willing to apply themselves to the Practise and Experience hereof, that they found their Understandings con∣vinced of it, and that it is founded upon the Scripture and Reason; I find a freedom of Mind to add some few Considerationss of this kind, for the Confirma∣tion hereof, besides what it is before mentioned of our Experience.</P>

<HI>principal Duty,</HI> so it necessarily in order both of <HI>Na∣ture</HI> and <HI>Time</HI> precedeth all other. But that it may be the better and more perfectly understood, as it is not only an outward Silence of the Body, but an inward Silence of the Mind, from all its own Imaginations and self-cogitations; let it be considered, according to Truth, and to the Principles &amp; Doctrines heretofore affirmed and proved, that Man is to be considered in a twofold respect, to wit, in his <HI>natural, unregenerate and fallen State</HI>; and in his <HI>spiritual &amp; renewed Con∣dition</HI>; from whence ariseth that distinction of the <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Spiritual Man,</HI> so much used by the Apo∣stle, and heretofore spoken of. Also these <HI>two Births</HI> of the Mind, proceed from the <HI>two Seeds</HI> in Man re∣spectively; to wit, the <HI>good Seed</HI> and the <HI>evil:</HI> And from the <HI>evil Seed</HI> doth not only proceed all manner of gross and abominable Wickedness and profanity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence <HI>Wicked∣nesses</HI> arise that are spiritual.</NOTE> but also Hypocrisie, and those <HI>Wickednesses,</HI> which the Scripture calls <HI>spiritual</HI>; because it is the Serpent working in and by the Natural Man in things that are <HI>spiritual</HI>; which having a shew and appearance of Good, are so much the more hurtful and danger∣ous, as it is Satan <HI>transformed</HI> and <HI>transforming himself into an Angel of Light:</HI> And therefore doth the Scrip∣ture so pressingly and frequently (as we have here∣tofore had occasion to observe) shut out and exclude the Natural Man from medling with the things of God, denying his endeavours therein, tho' acted and performed by the most eminent of his Parts, as of Wisdom and Utterance.</P>
<P>Also this <HI>spiritual Wickedness</HI> is of two sorts, tho' both one in kind, as proceeding from one Root, yet differing in their Degrees, and in the Subjects also sometimes. The one is, when as the Natural Man, medling with, and working in the things of <HI>Religion,</HI> doth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From <HI>whence</HI> all Heresies did s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring?</NOTE> from his own Conceptions and Divinations, affirm or purpose wrong and erroneous Notions and Opinions of God, and things Spiritual, and invent Superstitions, Ceremonies, Observations and Rites
<PB N="363" REF="003129_0188_0FF005A7DA2F4710"/>
in Worship; from whence have sprung all the He∣resies and Superstitions that are among <HI>Christians.</HI> The other is, when as the Natural Man, from a meer Conviction of his Understanding, doth in the forwardness of his own will, and by his own natu∣ral strength, without the influence and leading of God's Spirit, go about either in his Understanding to imagine, conceive, or think of the <HI>things of God,</HI> or actually to perform them by <HI>Preaching</HI> or <HI>Praying.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> is a missing both in Matter and Form; the <HI>second</HI> is a retaining of the Form, without the Life and Substance of Christianity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">True <HI>Chri∣stianity,</HI> wherein it Consists not</NOTE> because <HI>Christian Re∣ligion</HI> consisteth not in a meer Belief of true Doct∣rines, or a meer Performance of Acts good in themselves; or else the bare Letter of the Scrip∣ture, tho' spoken by a <HI>Drunkard,</HI> or a <HI>Devil,</HI> might be said to be <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Life,</HI> which I judge none will be so absurd as to affirm: And also it would follow, that where the Form of Godliness is, there the Power is also; which is contrary to the express words of the Apostle. For the Form of Godliness cannot be said to be, where either the Notions and Opinions believed are erroneous and ungodly, or the Acts performed evil and wicked; for then it would be the Form of Ungodliness, and not of Godliness: But of this further hereafter, when we shall speak particularly of Preaching and Praying. Now, tho' this last be not so bad as he former, yet it hath made way for it: For Men having first de∣parted from the Life and Substance of true <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Worship</HI> to wit, from the inward <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Vertue</HI> of the Spirit, so as therein to Act, and thereby to have all their Actions enlivened, have only retain'd the Form and Shew, to wit, the true Words and Ap∣pearance: And so acting in their own natural and unrenewed Wills in this Form, the Form could not but quickly decay, and be vitiated. For the work∣ing and active spirit of Man could not contain it self within the Simplicity and plainess of Truth; but
<PB N="364" REF="003129_0189_0FF005AB5A3198D0"/>
giving way to his own numerous Inventions and Imaginations, began to vary in the Form, and adapt to it his own Inventions; until, by degrees, the Form of Godliness, for the most part, came to be lost, as well as the Power. For this kind of <HI>Ido∣latry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Idolatry</HI> does hug its own Con∣ceptions.</NOTE> whereby Man loveth, idolizeth, and huggeth his own Conceptions, Inventions, and Product of his own Brain, is so incident unto him, and seated in his fallen Nature; that so long as his natural spirit is the first Author and Actor of him, and is that, by which he only is guided and moved in his Worship towards God, so as not first to wait for another Guide to direct him; he can never perform the pure Spiritual Worship, nor bring forth any thing, but the fruit of the first, fallen, natural and corrupt Root. Wherefore the time appointed of God being come, wherein by Jesus Christ he hath been pleased to Restore the true Spiritual Worship; and the outward Form of Wor∣ship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Form of <HI>Worship,</HI> but the Spi∣rit, is pre∣scribed by Christ.</NOTE> which was appointed by God to the Jews, and whereof the manner and time of its perfor∣mance was particularly determined by God him∣self, being come to an end, we find that <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the Author of the Christian Religion, pre∣scribes no <HI>set Form of Worship</HI> to his Children, un∣der the more pure Administration of the <HI>New Covenant</HI>; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>If any Object here, <HI>That the Lord's Prayer is a pre∣scribed Form of</HI> Prayer, <HI>and therefore of</HI> Worship, <HI>given by Christ to his Children.</HI></P>
<P>I answer; <HI>First,</HI> This can∣not be objected by any sort of <HI>Christians,</HI> that I know, because there are none who use not other Prayers, or that limit their Worship to this. <HI>Secondly,</HI> This was commanded to the Disciples, while yet weak, before they had received the Dispensation of the Gos∣pel; not that they should only use it in Praying, but that he might shew them by one Example how that their Prayers ought to be short, and not like the long Prayers of the <HI>Pharis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es.</HI> And that this was the Use of it, appears by all the Prayers, which di∣vers Saints afterwards made use of, whereof the Scripture makes mention: For none made use of this, neither repeated it; but used other Words, according as the thing required, and as the Spirit gave Utterance. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That this ought to be so under∣stood, appears from <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.26. of which afterwards mention shall be made at great∣er Length, where the Apostle saith, <HI>We know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it self maketh Intercession for us,</HI> &amp;c. But if this Prayer had been such a prescribed Form of Prayer to the Church, that had not been true; neither had they been ignorant what to pray, nor should they have needed the Help of the Spirit to teach them.</P></NOTE> save that he only tells them, That the <HI>Worship now to be performed</HI> is <HI>Spiritual,</HI> and <HI>in the Spirit.</HI>
<PB N="365" REF="003129_0189_0FF005AB5A3198D0"/>
And it's especially to be observed, that in the whole <HI>New Testament</HI> there is no order nor Com∣mand given in this thing, but to follow the Reve∣lation of the Spirit, save only that general, of <HI>Meeting together</HI>; a thing dearly owned, and dili∣gently practised by us, as shall hereafter more ap∣pear. True it is, mention is made of the Duties of <HI>Praying, Preaching</HI> and <HI>Singing</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pray, Preach <HI>and</HI> Sing <HI>in Spirit.</HI></NOTE> but what Order or Method should be kept in so doing, or that pre∣sently they should be set about so soon as the Saints are gathered, there is not one word to be found: Yea, these Duties (as shall afterwards be made ap∣pear) are always annexed to the Assistance, Lead∣ings and Motions of God's Spirit. Since then Man in his Natural State, is thus excluded from acting or moving in things Spiritual, how or what way shall he exercise this first and previous Duty of Waiting upon God, but by <HI>silence,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">To Wait on God, by what it is performed.</NOTE> and by bringing that Natural part to <HI>silence</HI>? Which is no other ways, but by abstaining from his own Thoughts and Imaginations, and from all the Self-workings and Motions of his own Mind, as well in things materially <HI>good,</HI> as <HI>evil</HI>; that he being <HI>silent,</HI> God may <HI>speak in him</HI> and the <HI>good Seed</HI> may arise. This, tho' hard to the Natural Man, is so answerable to Reason, and even Natural Experience in other things, that it cannot be denied. He that com∣eth to learn of a Master, if he expect to hear his Master, and be instructed by him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Simile of a Master and his Scholar.</NOTE> must not conti∣nually be speaking of the matter to be taught, and never be quiet; otherwise how shall his Ma∣ster have time to instruct him? Yea, tho' the Scholar were never so earnest to learn the Science; yet would the Master have reason to reprove him as untoward and indocile; if he would always be medling of himself, and still speaking, and not wait in silence patiently to hear his Master in∣structing and teaching him; who ought not to open his Mouth, until by his Master he were com∣manded
<PB N="366" REF="003129_0190_0FF005AE234AE598"/>
and allowed so to do. So also, if one were about to attend a great Prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a Prince and his Ser∣vant.</NOTE> he would be thought an impertinent and imprudent Ser∣vant, who, while he ought patiently and readily to wait, that he might answer the King when he speaks, and have his Eye upon him, to observe the least Motions and Inclinations of his Will, and to do accordingly, would be still deafening him with Discourse, tho' it were in Praises of him; and run∣ning to and fro, without any particular and imme∣diate Order to do things, that perhaps might be good in themselves, or might have been com∣manded at other times to others: Would the Kings of the Earth accept of such Servants or Service?<NOTE PLACE="marg">To Wait in Silence.</NOTE> Since then we are commanded to <HI>Wait upon God diligently</HI>; and in so doing it is promised, that our <HI>Strength shall be renewed</HI>; this <HI>Waiting</HI> can∣not be performed but by a <HI>silence,</HI> or <HI>cessation</HI> of the Natural part on our side: Since God manifests himself not to the outward Man, or Senses, so much as to the inward, to wit, to the Soul and Spirit.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The think∣ing busie Soul ex∣cludes the Voice of God.</NOTE> If the Soul be still thinking and working in her own Will, and busily exercised in her own Imaginations, tho' the matters, as in themselves, may be <HI>good</HI> concerning God; yet thereby she in∣capacitates her self from discerning the <HI>still, small Voice</HI> of the Spirit, and so hurts her self greatly, in that she neglects her chief Business of <HI>Waiting upon the Lord:</HI> Nothing less, than if I should busie my self, crying out and speaking of a Business, while in the mean time I neglect to hear One who is quietly whispering into my Ear, and in∣forming me in those things, which are most need∣ful for me to hear and know concerning that Bu∣siness. And since it is the chief Work of a <HI>Christi∣an</HI> to know the <HI>natural Will</HI> in its own proper Motions <HI>crucified,</HI> that God may both move in the Act and in the Will; the Lord chiefly regards this profound Subjection and Self-denial. For some Men

please themselves as much,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religious Speculati∣ons.</NOTE> and gratifie their own sensual Wills and Humors in high and curious Spe∣culations of Religion, affecting a Name and Reputa∣tion that way; or because those things by Custom, or other ways, are become pleasant and habitual to them, tho' not a whit more Regenerated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sensual Re∣creations.</NOTE> or inwardly Sanctified in their Spirits; as others gra∣tifie their Lust in Actions of Sensuality: And there∣fore both are alike hurtful to Men, and sinful in the sight of God; it being nothing but the meer fruit and effect of Man's natural and unrenewed will and spirit. Yea, should one (as many no doubt do) from a sense of Sin, and fear of Punish∣ment, seek to terrifie themselves from Sin,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thoughts</HI> of Death &amp; Hell, to keep out <HI>sin,</HI> are Fig-leaves.</NOTE> by multiplying thoughts of Death, Hell and Judgment, and by presenting to their Imaginations the Hap∣piness and Joys of Heaven, and also by multiplying Prayers and other Religious Performances; as these things could never deliver him from one Iniqui∣ty, without the secret and inward Power of God's Spirit and Grace, so would they signifie no more, than the <HI>Fig-leaves,</HI> wherewith <HI>Adam</HI> thought to cover his <HI>Nakedness.</HI> And seeing, it is only the Product of Man's own natural Will, proceeding from a Self-love, and seeking to save himself, and not arising purely from that <HI>Divine Seed</HI> of <HI>Righte∣ousness,</HI> which is given of God to all, for Grace and Salvation, it is rejected of God, and no ways acceptable unto him; since the Natural Man, as Natural, while he stands in that State, is with all his Arts, Parts and Actings, reprobated by him. This great duty then of waiting upon God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Denial of ones self.</NOTE> must needs be exercised in Man's denying Self, both inwardly and outwardly, in a still and meer de∣pendance upon God, in abstracting from all the Workings, Imaginations and Speculations of his own Mind; that being emptied, as it were, of him∣self, and so throughly crucified to the natural Pro∣ducts thereof, he may be fit to receive the Lord,
<PB N="368" REF="003129_0191_0FF005B096215820"/>
who will have no Co-partner nor Co-rival of his Glory and Power. And Man being thus stated, the little Seed of Righteousness, which God hath planted in his Soul, and Christ hath purchased for him, even the measure of Grace and Life (which is burthened and crucified by Man's natural <HI>Thoughts</HI> and <HI>Imaginations</HI>) receives a place to arise, and becometh a holy Birth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Holy Birth.</NOTE> and Geniture <HI>in</HI> Man; and is that <HI>Divine Air,</HI> in and by which Man's Soul and Spirit comes to be leavened: And by wait∣ing therein, he comes to be accepted in the sight of God, to stand in his Presence, hear his Voice, and observe the Motions of his holy Spirit. And so Man's place is to wait in this; and as hereby there are any objects presented to his Mind con∣cerning God, or things relating to Religion, his Soul may be exercised in them without hurt, and to the great profi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both of himself and others; because those things have their rise not from his own Will, but from God's Spirit. And therefore, as in the arisings and movings of this, his Mind is still to be exercised in Thinking and Meditating; so also in the more obvious acts of Preaching and Praying:<NOTE PLACE="marg">N. Quakers are against a meditat∣ing Mind.</NOTE> And so it may hence appear, we are not against Meditation, as some have sought falsly to infer from our Doctrine; but we are against the <HI>Thoughts</HI> and <HI>Imaginations</HI> of the natural Man, in his own Will,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From Na∣ture's Thoughts all Errors rise, we find.</NOTE> from which all Errors and He∣resies concerning the Christian Religion, in the whole World, have proceeded. But if it please God at any time, when one or more are waiting upon him, not to present such objects, as give them occasion to exercise their Minds in <HI>Thoughts</HI> and <HI>Imaginations,</HI> but purely to keep them in this holy Dependence; and as they persist therein, to cause this secret Refreshment, and the pure In∣comes of his holy Life, to flow in upon them; then they have good reason to be content, because by this (as we know by good and blessed Expe∣rience)
<PB N="369" REF="003129_0191_0FF005B096215820"/>
the Soul is more strengthened, renewed, and confirmed in the Love of God, and armed against the Power of Sin, than any way else:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soul re∣newed, by what?

<P N="11">§. XI. For there are <HI>two contrary Powers,</HI> or <HI>Spirits</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whatever Man does act, with∣out the Power of God, is not accepted.</NOTE> to wit, the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Spirit of this World,</HI> in which the <HI>Prince of Darkness</HI> bears rule, and over as many as are acted by it and work from it; and the <HI>Power</HI> or <HI>Spirit of God</HI> in which God worketh, and bear∣eth rule, and over as many as act in and from it. So whatever be the things that a Man thinketh of, or acteth in, however Spiritual or Religious, as to the Notion or Form of them, so long as he acteth and moveth in the natural and corrupt Spirit and Will; and not from, in and by the Power of God, he sinneth in all, and is not accepted of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 21.4▪</NOTE> For hence both the <HI>plowing</HI> and <HI>praying of the Wicked is sin:</HI> As also whatever a Man acts in and from the Spirit and Power of God, having his Understand∣ing and Will influenced and moved by it, whether it be Actions <HI>Religious, Civil,</HI> or even <HI>Natural,</HI> he is accepted in so doing in the sight of God, and is <HI>blessed in them.</HI> From what is said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jam. 1.25.</NOTE> it doth ap∣pear, how frivolous and Impertinent their <HI>Objection</HI> is, that say, they <HI>wait upon God in Praying and Preach∣ing</HI>; since <HI>Waiting</HI> doth of it self imply a <HI>passive Dependence,</HI> rather than an <HI>Acting.</HI> And since it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To pray &amp; preach without the Spirit, is Offence to God.</NOTE> and shall yet be more shewn, that <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Praying</HI> without the Spirit, is an offending of God, not a waiting upon him; and that <HI>Praying</HI> and <HI>Preaching</HI> by the Spirit, pre-supposes necessarily a <HI>silent waiting,</HI> for to feel the motions and influence of the Spirit to lead thereunto; and <HI>lastly,</HI> that in several of these places, where <HI>Praying</HI> is command∣ed,

<P N="12"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>II.</HI> This <HI>silent Waiting</HI> the Devil cannot Counterfeit</NOTE>§. XII. But <HI>Secondly</HI>; The <HI>Excellency</HI> of this silent waiting upon God doth appear, in that it is impossi∣ble for the <HI>Enemy,</HI> viz. the <HI>Devil,</HI> to counterfeit it, so as for any Soul to be deceived or deluded by him in the Exercise thereof. Now in all other matters, he may mix himself in with the natural Mind of Man, and so, by <HI>transforming</HI> himself, he may de∣ceive the Soul, by busying it about things perhaps innocent in themselves, while yet he keeps them from beholding the <HI>pure Light of Christ,</HI> and so from knowing distinctly his Duty, and doing of it. For that Envious Spirit of Man's Eternal Happiness knoweth well how to accommodate himself, and fit his Snares, for all the several Dispositions and Inclinations of Men: If he find one not fit to be engaged with gross Sins, or Worldly Lust, but ra∣ther averse from them, and Religiously inclined, he can fit himself to beguile such an one, by suf∣fering his Thoughts and Imaginations to run upon Spiritual matters, and so hurry him to work, act, and meditate in his own Will. For he well knoweth, that so long as Self bears rule, and the Spi∣rit of God is not the principal and chief Actor, Man is not put out of his reach:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Altar Pray∣ers, Pulpits Study,</HI> can∣not shut the Devil out.</NOTE> So therefore he can ac∣company the <HI>Priest</HI> to the <HI>Altar,</HI> the <HI>Preacher</HI> to the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> the <HI>Zealot</HI> to his <HI>Prayers</HI>; yea, the <HI>Doctor</HI> and <HI>Professor of Divinity</HI> to his <HI>Study</HI>; and there he can chearfully suffer him to labour and work among his Books, yea, and help him to find out and invent sub∣tile

Distinctions and Quiddities, by which both his Mind, and others through him, may be kept from heeding God's <HI>Light in the Conscience,</HI> and waiting upon him. There is not any Exercise whatsoever, wherein he cannot enter, and have a chief place, so as the Soul many times cannot discern it, ex∣cept in this alone: For he can only work in and by the Natural Man, and his Faculties, by secretly acting upon his Imagnations and Desires, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and therefore, when he (to wit, the Natural Man) is silent, there he must also stand. And therefore when the Soul comes to this <HI>Silence,</HI> and as it were is brought to nothingness as to her own work∣ings, then the Devil is shut out; for the pure Pre∣sence of God, and shining of his Light he cannot abide, because so long as a Man is thinking and meditating as of himself, he cannot be sure, but the Devil is influencing him therein; but when he comes wholly to be silent, as the <HI>pure Light</HI> of God shines in upon him, then he is sure that the Devil is shut out; for beyond the Imaginations he can∣not go, which we often find by sensible Experi∣ence. For he that of Old is said to have come to the <HI>gathering together</HI> of the <HI>Children of God,</HI> is not wanting to come to our <HI>Assemblies.</HI> And indeed he can well enter and work in a Meeting, that's silent only as to words, either by keeping the Minds in various Thoughts and Imaginations, or by stupifying them, so as to overwhelm them with a spirit of heaviness and slothfulness: But when we retire out of all, and are turned in, both by be∣ing <HI>diligent</HI> and <HI>watchful</HI> upon the one hand, and also <HI>silent</HI> and <HI>retired</HI> out of all our Thoughts upon the other; as we abide in this sure place, we feel our selves out of his reach. Yea, oftentimes the Power and Glory of God will break forth and appear, just as the bright Sun through many Clouds and Mists, to the dispelling of that Power of Darkness; which will also be sensibly felt, seeking to cloud and

<P N="13"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>III.</HI> The Wor∣ship of the <HI>Quakers</HI> not stopped or inter∣rupted by Men or Devils.</NOTE>§. XIII. <HI>Thirdly</HI>; The Excellency of this <HI>Worship</HI> doth appear, in that it can neither be stopped, nor interrupted by the Malice of Men or Devils, as all others can. Now Interruptions and Stop∣pings of Worship, may be understood in a two-fold respect, either as we are hindred from <HI>Meet∣ing,</HI> as being outwardly by Violence separated one from another; or when permitted to <HI>Meet together,</HI> as we are interrupted by the Tumult, Noise and Confusion, which such as are Malicious may use to molest or distract us.

But <HI>secondly</HI>; It doth as well ap∣pear as to those Molestations which occur, when we are met together, what advantage this True and spiritual Worship gives us, beyond all others; seeing in despight of a thousand Interruptions and Abuses, one of which were sufficient to have stop∣ped all other sorts of <HI>Christians,</HI> we have been able, through the Nature of this <HI>Worship,</HI> to keep it uninterrupted as to God; and also, at the same time, to shew forth an Example of our <HI>Christian Patience</HI> towards all, even oftentimes to the reach∣ing and convincing of our Opposers. For there is no sort of Worship used by others, which can subsist (tho' they be permitted to meet) unless they be either Authorized and Protected by the Magistrate, or defend themselves with the Arm of Flesh: But we at the same time exercise Wor∣ship towards God, and also patiently bear the Reproaches and Ignominies, which <HI>Christ prophesied</HI> should be so incident and frequent to Christians.

<PB N="374" REF="003129_0194_0FF005B7EAE78928"/>
sought to provoke us, weary us, and molest us; but in vain. It would be almost incredible to de∣clare, and indeed a shame, that among Men pre∣tending to be <HI>Christians,</HI> it should be mentioned, what things of this kind Men's Eyes have seen, and I my self, with others, have shared of, in Suf∣fering! There they have often beaten us, and cast water and dirt upon us; there they have danced, leaped, sung, and spoken all manner of profane and ungodly words; offered Violence, and shameful Be∣haviour, to grave Women and Virgins; jeered, mocked and scoffed, asking us, <HI>If the Spirit was not yet come?</HI> And much more, which were tedious here to relate: And all this while we have been seriously and silently sitting together, and waiting upon the Lord. So that by these things our inward and spiritual Fellowship with God, and one with another, in the <HI>pure Life of Righteousness,</HI> hath not been hindered. But on the contrary, the Lord know∣ing our Sufferings and Reproaches for his Testi∣mony's sake, hath caused his Power and Glory more to abound among us, and hath mightily re∣freshed us by the sense of his Love, which hath filled our Souls; and so much the rather, as we found our selves, gathered into the <HI>Name of the Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Proverbs 18.10.</NOTE> which is the <HI>strong Tower of the Righteous</HI>; whereby we felt our selves sheltered from re∣ceiving any inward hurt through their Malice: And also that he had delivered us from that vain Name and Profession of <HI>Christianity,</HI> under which our Opposers were not ashamed to bring forth those bitter cursed Fruits. Yea, sometimes in the midst of this Tumult and Opposition, God would <HI>Powerfully move</HI> some or other of us by his Spirit, both to testifie of that <HI>Joy,</HI> which not∣withstanding their Malice we enjoyed, and power∣fully to declare, in the Evidence and Demonstra∣tion of the Spirit, against their <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Wicked∣ness</HI>; so as the Power of Truth hath brought them

For the <HI>Old Covenant Worship</HI> had an out∣ward Glory, Temple, and Ceremonies, and was full of outward Splendor and Majesty, having an out∣ward Tabernacle and Altar, beautified with Gold, Silver, and Precious Stone; and their Sacrifices were tied to an outward, particular Place, even the out∣ward <HI>Mount Sion</HI>; and those that prayed, behoved to pray with their Faces towards that outward <HI>Tem∣ple:</HI> And therefore all this behoved to be protected by an outward Arm. Nor could the <HI>Jews</HI> peace∣ably

have enjoyed it, but when they were secured from the Violence of their outward Enemies: And therefore when at any time their Enemies prevailed over them, their Glory was darkned, and their Sacrifices stopped; and the Face of their Worship marred: Hence they Complain, Lament and Bewail the destroying of the <HI>Temple</HI> as a Loss irreparable. But Jesus Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The New Covenant Worship is Inward. <HI>John 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.36.</HI></NOTE> the Author and Instructor of the <HI>New Covenant-Worship,</HI> testifies, that God is neither to be <HI>Worshipped</HI> in this, nor that place; but in the Spirit and in Truth: And forasmuch as his <HI>Kingdom is not of this World,</HI> neither doth his <HI>Worship</HI> consist in it, or need either the Wisdom, Glory, Riches, or Splendor of this World, to Beautifie or Adorn it; nor yet the outward <HI>Power</HI> or <HI>Arm</HI> of <HI>Flesh</HI> to main∣tain, uphold, or protect it; but it is and may be performed by those that are Spiritually minded, not withstanding all <HI>Opposition, Violence,</HI> and <HI>Malice</HI> of Men; because it being purely Spiritual, it is out of the reach of Natural Men to interrupt or molest it. Even as Jesus Christ, the Author thereof, did enjoy and possess his Spiritual Kingdom, while Oppressed, Persecuted, and P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ejected of Men, and as in despite of the Malice and Rage of the Devil, <HI>he spoiled Prin∣cipalities and Powers, triumphing over them, and through Death destroyed him, that had the Power of Death, that is,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. 2.15.</NOTE> <HI>the Devil</HI>; so also all his Followers both can and do Worship him, not only without the Arm of Flesh to protect them, but even when Oppressed. For their Worship being Spiritual, is by the Power of the Spirit defended and maintained:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Carnal Worships cannot stand with∣out the Arm of Flesh.</NOTE> but such Worships as are <HI>Carnal,</HI> and consist in <HI>Carnal</HI> and <HI>Outward Cere∣monies</HI> and <HI>Observations,</HI> need a <HI>Carnal</HI> and <HI>Outward Arm</HI> to protect and defend them, else they cannot stand and subsist. And therefore it appears, that the several Worships of our Opposers, both Papists and Protestants, are of this kind, and not the true Spiritual and <HI>New Covenant-Worship</HI> of Christ; because, as hath been observed, they cannot stand without the Pro∣tection

or Countenance of the outward Magistrate, neither can be performed, if there be the least Op∣position: For they are not in the <HI>Patience of Jesus,</HI> to serve &amp; worship him with Sufferings, Ignominies, Calumnies and Reproaches. And from hence have sprung all those <HI>Wars, Fightings,</HI> &amp; <HI>Bloodshed</HI> among <HI>Christians,</HI> while each by the Arm of Flesh endea∣vour'd to defend and protect their own Way and Worship: And from this also spr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng up that Mon∣strous Opinion of <HI>Persecution</HI>; of which we shall speak more at length hereafter.</P>
<P N="15">§. XV. But <HI>Fourthly</HI>; The Nature of this Worship,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>IV.</HI> True Wor∣ship in Spi∣rit esta∣blished by Christ.</NOTE> which is performed by the Operation of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> the Natural Man being silent, doth appear from these words of Christ, John 4.23, 24. <HI>But the hour cometh, &amp; now is, when the true Worshippers shall Worship the Fa¦ther in</HI> Spirit &amp; in Truth: <HI>For the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a</HI> Spirit, <HI>and they that worship him, must worship him in</HI> Spirit &amp; in Truth. This Testimony is the more especially to be observed, for that it is both the <HI>first, chiefest,</HI> and <HI>most ample Testimony,</HI> which Christ gives us of his Christian Worship, as different and contra distinguished from that under the Law. For First, he sheweth, that the Season is now come, wherein the <HI>Worship must be in</HI> Spirit &amp; in Truth; <HI>for the Father seeketh such to worship him:</HI> So then it is no more a Worship consisting in <HI>outward Observations,</HI> to be performed by Man at <HI>set Times</HI> or <HI>Opportunities,</HI> which he can do in his own Will, and by his own Natural Strength; for else it would not differ in <HI>Matter,</HI> but only in some <HI>Circumstances,</HI> from that under the Law. Next,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reason Christ gives for a Wor∣ship in Spi∣rit.</NOTE> as for a Reason of this Wor∣ship, we need not to give any other, and indeed none can give a better, than that which <HI>Christ</HI> giveth, which I think should be sufficient to satisfie every Christian, to wit, GOD <HI>is a</HI> SPIRIT, <HI>and they that worship him, must worship him in</HI> Spirit &amp; in Truth. As this ought to be received, because it is the words of Christ, so also it is founded upon so clear a De∣monstration
<PB N="378" REF="003129_0196_0FF005BD7A8EB130"/>
of Reason, as sufficiently evidenceth its <HI>Verity.</HI> For Christ excellently argues from the <HI>Analogy</HI> that ought to be betwixt the <HI>Object,</HI> and the <HI>Worship</HI> directed thereunto:</P>
<P><LIST TYPE="syllogism">
<HEAD>Arg.</HEAD>
<ITEM>God is a <HI>Spirit;</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore he must be worshiped in <HI>Spirit.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>This is so certain, that it can suffer no Contra∣diction; yea, and this Analogy is so necessary to be minded, that under the Law, when God insti∣tuted and appointed that Ceremonial Worship to the <HI>Jews,</HI> because that Worship was Outward, that there might be an <HI>Analogy</HI>; he saw it necessary to Condescend to them as in a special manner, to dwell betwixt the Cherubims within the Tabernacle, and afterwards to make the Temple of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in a sort his habitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Glory of the Out∣ward Tem∣ple.</NOTE> and cause something of an out∣ward Glory and Majesty to appear, by causing Fire from Heaven to consume the Sacrifices, and filling the Temple with a cloud: Through and by which <HI>Mediums,</HI> Visible to the outward Eye, he mani∣fested himself proportionably to that Outward Worship, which he had Commanded them to per∣form. So now under the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> he seeing meet in his Heavenly Wisdom to lead his Children in a path more Heavenly and Spiritual, and in a Way both more easie and familiar; and also purposing to disappoint Carnal &amp; Outward Observations, that his may have an Eye more to an inward Glory and King∣dom, than to an outward, he hath given us for an Example hereof, the Appearance of his Beloved Son,<NOTE PLACE="marg">As <HI>Moses</HI> did from Outward, so <HI>Christ</HI> delivers his from In∣ward Sla∣very.</NOTE> the Lord Jesus Christ, who (instead that <HI>Moses</HI> delivered the <HI>Israelites</HI> out of their outward bondage, and by outwardly destroying their Enemies) hath delivered and doth deliver us by Suffering, and Dying by the Hands of his Enemies; thereby Tri∣umphing over the Devil, and his, and our inward Enemies, and delivering us there-from. He hath also instituted an Inward and Spiritual Worship: So that God now tieth not his People to the Temple of
<PB N="379" REF="003129_0196_0FF005BD7A8EB130"/>
<HI>Jerusalem,</HI> nor yet unto outward Ceremonies and Observations; but taketh the <HI>Heart</HI> of every Christian for a Temple to dwell in; and there im∣mediately appeareth, and giveth him direction how to serve him in any outward acts. Since, as Christ argueth, <HI>God is a Spirit,</HI> he will now be worshiped in the Spirit, where he reveals him∣self, and dwelleth with the <HI>contrite in heart.</HI> Now, since it is the Heart of Man that now is become the Temple of God, in which he will be worship∣ped, and no more in particular outward Temples, (since as blessed <HI>Stephen</HI> said, out of the Prophet, to the Professing <HI>Jews</HI> of Old, <HI>The Most High dwel∣leth not in Temples made with hands</HI>) as before the <HI>Glory of the Lord</HI> descended to fill the outward Temple, it behoved to be purified and cleansed and all polluted stuff removed out of it; yea, and the place for the Tabernacle was overlaid with Gold, the most precious, clean, and clearest of Metals: So also before God be worshipped in the inward Temple of the Heart, it must also be purified of its own Filth, and all its own Thoughts and Imaginations, that so it may be fit to receive the Spirit of God, and to be acted by it. And doth not this directly lead us to that inward Si∣lence, of which we have spoken, and exactly point∣ed out? And further, This Worship must be <HI>in Truth</HI>; intimating, that this Spiritual Worship, thus acted, is only and properly a true Worship; as being that which, for the Reasons above ob∣served, cannot be counterfeited by the Enemy, nor yet performed by the Hypocrite.</P>
<P N="16">§. XVI. And tho' this <HI>Worship</HI> be indeed very different from the divers established invented Wor∣ships among Christians, and therefore may seem strange to many; yet hath it been testified of, commended and practised, by the most Pious of all sorts, in all Ages, as by many evident Testimonies might be proved. So that from the professing
<PB N="380" REF="003129_0197_0FF005BF1DF261C0"/>
and practising thereof, the Name of <HI>Mysticks</HI> hath arisen, as of a certain Sect, generally commended by all;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A certain Sect of <HI>My∣sticks</HI> a∣mong the <HI>Papists,</HI> their in∣ward Ex∣ercise See <HI>Sancta So∣phia,</HI> print∣ed <HI>Anno Dom. 1657</HI></NOTE> whose Writings are full both of the Expla∣nation and of the Commendation of this sort of Worship; where they plentifully assert this <HI>inward Introversion</HI> and <HI>Abstraction of the Mind,</HI> as they call it, <HI>from all Images and Thoughts,</HI> and the <HI>Prayer of the Will:</HI> Yea, they look upon this, as the <HI>heighth</HI> of <HI>Christian Perfection</HI>; so that some of them, tho' professed Papists, do not doubt to affirm, <HI>That such as have attained this method of Worship, or are aim∣ing at it,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>English Benidict∣ines</HI> Testi∣mony for the Spiri∣tual Wor∣ship, a∣gainst their Masses and set Devo∣tions.</NOTE> (as in a Book called <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> put out by the <HI>English Benedictines,</HI> Printed at <HI>Doway Anno.</HI> 1657.

Yet never∣theless, it appears by this, and many other pas∣sages, which out of their <HI>Mystick Writers</HI> might be mentioned, how they look upon this Worship, as excelling all other; and that such as arrived here∣unto, had no absolute need of the others: Yea, (see the Life of <HI>Balthazer Alvares,</HI> in the same <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> Tract. 3. Sect. 1. cap. 7.) such as tasted of this, quickly confessed, that the other <HI>Forms</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies of Worship</HI> were useless as to them; neither did they perform them, as things necessary, but meerly for Order or Example sake.
<PB N="381" REF="003129_0197_0FF005BF1DF261C0"/>
And therefore, tho' some of them were so over∣clouded with the common Darkness of their Pro∣fession, yet could they affirm, that this Spiritual Worship was still to be retained and sought for, tho' there be a necessity of omitting their out∣ward Ceremonies. Hence <HI>Bernard,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bernard</HI> preferring the Spirit above <HI>Po∣pish</HI> Orde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> as in many other places, so in his Epistle to one <HI>William,</HI> Abbot of the same Order, saith, <HI>Take heed to the Rule of God; the Kingdom of God is within you:</HI> And after∣wards, saying, That their outward Orders and Rules should be observed, he adds; <HI>But otherwise when it shall happen, that one of these two must be omitted, in such a case, these are much rather to be omitted, than those former: For by how much the</HI> Spirit <HI>is more excellent and noble than the</HI> Body, <HI>by so much are</HI> Spiritual Exercises <HI>more profitable than</HI> Corporal. Is not that then the best of Worships, which the best of Men in all Ages, and of all Sects, have com∣mended, and which is most suitable to the Doctrine of Christ?

<P N="17"><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="1"/> §. XVII. First, <HI>It seems to be an unprofitable Exer∣cise, for a Man to be doing or thinking nothing; and that one might be much better imployed, either in medi∣tating upon some</HI> good Subject, <HI>or otherwise praying to, or praising God.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; That is not unprofitable, which is of absolute necessity, before any other Duty can be acceptably performed, as we have shewn this <HI>Wait∣ing</HI> to be. Moreover, those have but a carnal and gross Apprehension of God, and of the things of his Kingdom, that imagine, that Men please him by their own Workings and Actings: Whereas, as hath been shewn, the <HI>first step</HI> for a Man to fear God, is to cease from his own Thoughts and Ima∣ginations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 1.16, 17.</NOTE> and suffer God's Spirit to work in him: For we must <HI>cease to do evil,</HI> ere we <HI>learn to do well</HI>; and this medling in things <HI>spiritual,</HI> by Man's own natural Understanding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We must cease to do i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>ere</HI> we learn to do well.</NOTE> is one of the greatest and most dangerous Evils that Man is incident to; be∣ing that which occasioned our first Parents fall, to wit, a forwardness to desire to know things, and a medling with them, both without and contrary to the Lord's Command.</P>

be particularly moved to go to such a Place at such a Time; since to meet at set Times and Places, seems to be an outward Observation and Ceremony, contrary to what you at other times assert?</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer first: To meet at set Times and Places, is not any Religious Act, or part of Worship in it self;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Publick Meetings their Use, and its Reason as∣serted,</NOTE> but only an outward Conveniency, necessary for our seeing one another, so long as we are cloathed with this <HI>outward Tabernacle:</HI> And therefore out Meeting at <HI>set Times and Places</HI> is not a part of our Worship, but a preparatory Accommodation of out outward Man, in order to a publick visible Worship, since we set not about the visible Acts of Worship when we Meet together, until we be led thereunto by the Spirit of God. <HI>Secondly</HI>; God hath seen meet, so long as his Children are in this World, to make use of the outward Senses, not only as a means to convey Spiri∣tual Life, as by <HI>speaking, praying, praising,</HI> &amp;c. which cannot be done to mutual Edification, but when we hear and see one another; but also for to entertain an outward visible Testimony for his Name in the World: He causeth the inward Life (which is also many times not conveyed by the <HI>outward Senses</HI>) the more to abound, when his Children assemble them∣selves diligently together to wait upon him; that <HI>as Iron sharpeneth Iron,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 27.17.</NOTE> so the seeing of the Face one of another, when both are inwardly gathered unto the Life, giveth occasion for the Life secretly to rise, and pass from Vessel to Vessel. And as many Candles lighted, and put in one place, do greatly augment the <HI>Light,</HI> and make it more to shine forth; so when many are gathered together into the same <HI>Life,</HI> there is more of the Glory of God, and his Power appears, to the Refreshment of each Individal; for that he partakes not only of the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> raised in himself, but in all the rest▪ and therefore Christ hath particularly promised a Blessing to such, as Assemble together in his <HI>Name,</HI> seeing he will be <HI>in the midst of them,</HI> Mat. 18.20.
<PB N="384" REF="003129_0199_0FF005C423E6C7D8"/>
And the Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> doth precisely prohibit the neglect of this Duty, as being of very dangerous and dreadful Consequence, in these words; Heb. 10.24. <HI>And let us consider one another, to provoke unto love, and to good works; not forsaking the assembling of our selves together,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Assemb∣ling of our selves is not to be neg∣lected.</NOTE> <HI>as the manner of some is;—For if we sin wilfully, after that we have received the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for sins.</HI> And therefore the Lord hath shewn, that he hath a particular respect to such, as thus Assemble themselves together, because that thereby a publick Testimony for him is up∣held in the Earth, and his Name is thereby Glo∣rified; and therefore such as are right in their Spi∣rits, are naturally drawn to keep the Meetings of God's People, and never want a Spiritual influence to lead them thereunto: And if any do it in a meer customary way, they will no doubt suffer Condem∣nation for it. Yet cannot the appointing of places and Times be accounted a <HI>Ceremony</HI> and <HI>Observation,</HI> done in Man's <HI>Will,</HI> in the Worship of God, seeing none can say that it is an Act of Worship, but only a meer <HI>presenting</HI> of our <HI>Persons</HI> in order to it, as is above-said. Which that it was practised by the Primitive Church and Saints, all our Adversaries do acknowledge.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="3"/> <HI>Lastly,</HI> some object, <HI>That this manner of Worship in</HI> Silence, <HI>is not to be found in</HI> all the Srcipture.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I <HI>Answer</HI>; We make not Silence to be the sole matter of our <HI>Worship</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">In Waiting for the Spi∣rit's Gui∣dance, Si∣lence is sup∣posed.</NOTE> since, as I have above said, there are many Meetings, which are seldom (if ever) altogether silent; some or other are still moved either to <HI>Preach, Pray,</HI> or <HI>Praise:</HI> And so in this, our Meetings cannot be but like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Meetings of the Primitive Churches recorded in Scripture, since our <HI>Adversaries</HI> confess, that they did Preach and Pray by the Spirit.

Since we may well conclude, they did not speak, until they were moved; and so no doubt had sometimes Silence, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.1. before the Spirit came upon them, it is said,—<HI>They were all with one accord in one place</HI>: And then it is said, <HI>The</HI> Spirit <HI>suddenly came upon them</HI>; but no mention is made of any one speaking at that time; and I would willingly know, what Absurdity our Adver∣saries can infer, should we conclude, they were a while silent?</P>
<P>But if it be urged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inst.</NOTE> That <HI>a whole</HI> Silent Meeting <HI>cannot be found in Scripture.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; Supposing such a thing were not Re∣corded, it will not therefore follow,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Silent Meetings</HI> are proved from Scrip∣ture and Reason.</NOTE> that it is not Lawful; seeing it naturally followeth from other Scripture Precepts, as we have proved this doth. For seeing the Scriputre commands to meet toge∣ther, and when met, the Scripture prohibits Prayers or Preachings, but as the Spirit moveth thereunto: If People meet together, and the Spirit move not to such Acts, it will necessarily follow, that they must be silent. But further, there might have been ma∣ny such things among the Saints of Old, tho' not recorded in Scripture; and yet we have enough in Scripture, signifying, that such things were. For <HI>Job</HI> sat silent <HI>seven Days together with his Friends</HI>; Here was a long Silent Meeting. See also <HI>Ezra</HI> 9.4. and <HI>Ezekel</HI> 14.1. and 20.1. Thus having shewn the Excellency of this <HI>Worship,</HI> proving it from Scripture and Reason, and answered the Objections, which are commonly made against it; which, tho' it may suf∣fice to the Explanation and Proof of our Proposition; yet I shall add something more par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iclarly of <HI>Preaching, Praying,</HI> and <HI>Singing,</HI> and so proceed to the following <HI>Proposition.</HI></P>

And how much the fertiler and stronger a Man's <HI>Invention</HI> is, and the more Industrious and Laborious he is in Collecting such <HI>Observations,</HI> and can utter them with the Excellency of Speech and Humane Elo∣quence, so much the more is he accounted an Able and Excellent Preacher.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">True Preaching by the Spirit.</NOTE>To this we Oppose, that when the Saints are met together, and every one gathered to the Gift and Grace of God in themselves, he that Ministreth, being acted thereunto by the arising of the Grace in himself, ought to speak forth what the Spirit of God furnisheth him with; not minding the <HI>Eloquence</HI> and Wisdom of Words, but the Demonstration of the Spirit and of Power: And that either in the Inter∣preting some part of Scripture, in case the Spirit, which is the good Remembrancer, lead him so to do; or otherwise Words of <HI>Exhortation, Advice, Reproof,</HI> and <HI>Instruction,</HI> or the sense of some Spiritual Experiences: All which will still be agreeable to the Scripture, tho' perhaps not relative to, nor foun∣ed upon any particular <HI>Chapter</HI> or <HI>Verse,</HI> as a <HI>Text.</HI> Now let us Examine and Consider, which of these two sorts of Preaching is most agreeable to the Precepts and Practice of Christ and his Apostles, and the Primitive Church, recorded in Scripture? For <HI>First,</HI> as to their <HI>Preaching</HI> upon a <HI>Text,</HI> if it were not meerly Customary or Premeditated, but done by the immediate motion of the Spirit, we should not blame it; but to do it as they do, there is neither Precept nor Practice, that ever I could observe in the <HI>New Te∣stament,</HI> as a part of the <HI>Instituted Worship</HI> thereof.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> But they <HI>Alledge,</HI> That <HI>Christ took the Book of</HI> Isaiah, <HI>and read out of it, and spake therefrom; and that</HI> Peter <HI>Preached from a sentence of the Prophet</HI> Joel.</P>
<PB N="387" REF="003129_0200_0FF005C70C2F9160"/>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer, that Christ and <HI>Peter</HI> did it not but as immediately acted and moved thereunto by the Spirit of God, and that without Premeditation;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1.</HI> Christ's and <HI>Peter</HI>'s speaking was not by Premedi∣tation.</NOTE> which I suppose our adversaries will not deny: In which case we willingly approve of it. But what is this to their customary conned way, without either waiting for, or expecting the Movings or Leadings of the Spirit? Moreover, that neither Christ nor <HI>Peter</HI> did it as a settled custom or Form, to be constantly practised by all the Ministers of the Church, appears, in that most of all the Ser∣mons recorded of Christ and his <HI>Apostles</HI> in Scrip∣ture, were without this; as appears, from Christ's Sermon upon the mount, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.1, &amp;c. <HI>Mark</HI> 4.1, &amp;c. and <HI>Paul</HI>'s Preaching to the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and to the <HI>Jews,</HI> &amp;c. As then it appears, that this method of preaching is not grounded upon any Scripture-Precept; so the nature of it is contrary to the Preaching of Christ under the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> as exprest and recommended in Scripture. For Christ in sending forth his Disciples, expresly mentioneth, that they are not to speak <HI>of</HI> or <HI>from</HI> themselves, or to fore-cast before hand; but that which the Spirit <HI>in the same hour shall teach them</HI>; as is particularly mentioned in the Three Evan∣gelists, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.20. <HI>Mark</HI> 13.11. <HI>Luke</HI> 12.12. Now if Christ gave this Order to his Disciples, be∣fore he departed from them, as that which they were to practise, during his abode outwardly with them; much more were they to do it after his de∣parture, since then they were more especially to receive the Spirit, to <HI>lead them in all things,</HI> and to <HI>bring all things to their remembrance,</HI> John 14.26. And if they were to do so, when they appeared before the Magistrates and Princes of the Earth, much more in the Worship of God, when they stand specially before him; seeing, as is above shewn, his Worship is to be performed in Spirit: And therefore, after their receiving of the Holy

Ghost, it is said, Acts 2.4. <HI>They spake as the</HI> Spirit <HI>gave them utterance</HI>; not what they had studied, and gathered from Books in their Closets in a pre∣meditated way.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Franciscus Lambertus</HI> his Testimo∣ny against the <HI>Priests</HI> studied In∣ventions <HI>&amp;</HI> Figments.</NOTE><HI>Franciscus Lambertus</HI> before cited, speaketh well, and sheweth their Hypocrisie; <HI>Tract.</HI> 5. of <HI>Prophecy</HI>; Chap. 3. saying; <HI>Where are they now, that Glory in their Inventions, who say, a brave Invention, a brave Invention! This they call Invention, which themselves have made up; but what have the Faithful to do with such kind of Inventions? It is not Figments, nor yet In∣ventions, that we will have; but things that are solid, invincible, eternal and heavenly; not which</HI> Men <HI>have invented, but which</HI> God <HI>hath revealed: For if we be∣lieve the</HI> Scripture, <HI>our Invention profiteth nothing, but to</HI> provoke God <HI>to our ruine.</HI> And afterwards, <HI>Beware</HI> (saith he) <HI>that thou determine not precisely to speak what before thou hast meditated, whatsoever it be; for tho' it be lawful to determine the Text, which thou art to expound, yet not at all the Interpretation; lest, if thou so dost, thou take from the</HI> Holy Spirit <HI>that which is his; to wit, to</HI> direct thy Speech, <HI>that thou may'st prophesie in the Name of the Lord, void of Learn∣ing, Meditation and Experience, and as if thou hadst studied nothing at all; committing thy Heart, thy Tongue, and thy self wholly unto his</HI> Spirit, <HI>and trusting nothing to the former</HI> Studying <HI>or</HI> Meditation; <HI>but saying with thy self, in great confidence of the Divine Promise,</HI> The Lord will give a word, with much Power unto those that preach the Gospel. <HI>But above all things, be careful thou follow not the manner of</HI> Hypocrites, <HI>who have written almost word by word, what they are to say, as if they were to repeat some Verses upon a Theatre, having learned all their Preaching, as they do that</HI> act Tragedies. <HI>And afterwards, when they are in the place of Prophesying, pray the Lord to direct their Tongue; but in the mean time shutting up the way of the</HI> Holy Spirit, <HI>they determine to say nothing, but what they have written. O unhappy kind of</HI> Prophets, <HI>yea,

and truly Cursed, which depend not upon</HI> God's Spirit, <HI>but upon their own Writings or Meditation! Why pray∣est thou to the Lord, thou false Prophet, to give thee his</HI> Holy Spirit, <HI>by which thou may'st speak things pro∣fitable, and yet thou</HI> repellest the Spirit? <HI>Why preferrest thou thy</HI> Meditation <HI>or</HI> Study <HI>to the</HI> Spirit of God? <HI>Otherwise, why committest thou not thy self to the</HI> Spi∣rit?</P>
<P N="19">§. XIX. <HI>Secondly</HI>; This manner of Preaching, as used by them, (considering that they also affirm,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>2</HI> The word Man's Wis∣dom bring begets not Faith.</NOTE> <HI>That it may be, and often is, performed by Men, who are wicked, or void of true Grace)</HI> cannot only not edifie the Church, beget or nourish true Faith, but is destructive to it; being directly contrary to the Nature of the <HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Apostolick Ministry</HI> men∣tioned in the Scriptures: For the <HI>Apostle preached the Gospel not in the wisdom of words, lest the Cross of Christ should be of none Effect,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.17. But this Preaching, not being done by the Actings and Movings of God's Spirit, but by Man's Invention and Eloquence, in his own Will, and through his natural and acquired Parts and Learning, is in the Wisdom of Words; and therefore the <HI>Cross of Christ</HI> is thereby made of none Effect. The Apo∣stle's Speech &amp; Preaching was not <HI>with enticing Words of Man's Wisdom, but in Demonstration of the Spirit and of Power</HI>; That the Faith of their Hearers <HI>should not stand in the Wisdom of Men, but in the Power of God,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.3, 4, 5. But this Preaching having nothing of the Spirit and Power in it, both the Preachers and Hearers confessing they wait for no such thing, nor yet are often-times sensible of it, must needs stand in the enticing words of Man's Wisdom; since it is by the meer Wisdom of Man it is sought after, and the meer Strength of Man's Eloquence and enticing Words, it is uttered; and therefore no wonder, if the Faith of such as hear and depend upon such Preachers and Preach∣ings, stand in the Wisdom of Men, and not in the
<PB N="390" REF="003129_0202_0FEFD75947466D40"/>
Power of God. The Apostles declared, That they <HI>spake not in the words which</HI> Man's Wisdom <HI>teacheth, but which the</HI> Holy Ghost <HI>teacheth,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.13. But these Preachers confess, that they are strangers to the Holy Ghost, his Motions and Operations, neither do they wait to feel them; and therefore they speak in the words, which their own natural Wisdom and Learning teach them, mixing them in, and ad∣ding them to such words, as they steal out of the Scripture, and other Books; and therefore speak not what the Holy Ghost teacheth.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> This is contrary to the Method and Order of the Primitive Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>3.</HI> True Church's Method was to speak by Revelation</NOTE> mentioned by the Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.30, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where in <HI>Preaching</HI> eve∣ry one is to wait for his <HI>Revelation,</HI> and to give place one unto another, according as things are revealed. But here there is no waiting for a <HI>Re∣velation,</HI> but the Preacher must speak, and not that which is revealed unto him, but what he hath pre∣pared and premeditated before-hand.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly</HI>; By this kind of Preaching, the Spirit of God,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>4.</HI> The Spi∣rit is shut out by Priests to be the Teacher.</NOTE> which should be the chief Instructor and Teacher of God's People, and whose Influence is that only which makes all Preaching effectual and beneficial for the edifying of Souls, is shut out; and Man's natural Wisdom, Learning and Parts, set up and exalted: Which (no doubt) is a great and chief Reason, why the Preaching among the gene∣rality of Christians is so unfruitful and unsuccessful. Yea, according to this Doctrine, the Devil may preach, and ought to be heard also; seeing he both knoweth the Truth, and hath as much Eloquence as any. But what avails Excellency of Speech, if the Demonstration and Power of the Spirit be wanting, which toucheth the Conscience? We see, that when the Devil confessed to the Truth, yet Christ would have none of his Testimony. And as these pregnant Testimonies of the Scripture, do prove this part of Preaching to be contrary
<PB N="391" REF="003129_0202_0FEFD75947466D40"/>
to the Doctrine of Christ; so do they also prove <HI>that</HI> of <HI>ours,</HI> before affirmed, to be Conform there∣unto.</P>
<P N="20"><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> §. XX. But if any object after this manner, <HI>Have not many been Benefitted, and both Converted and Edified, by the Ministry of such as have Premeditated their preachings; yea, and hath not the</HI> Spirit <HI>often con∣curred, by its Divine Influence, with Preachings thus pre∣meditated, so as they have been powerfully born in upon the Souls of the Hearers, to their advantage?</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I Answer, Tho' that be granted, which I shall not deny, it will not infer,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Paul</HI> perse∣cuting, was converted: Is therefore persecuting good?</NOTE> that the thing was good in it self; more than, because <HI>Paul</HI> was met with by Christ, to the converting of his Soul, riding to <HI>Damascus</HI> to persecute the Saints, that he did well in so doing. Neither particular Actions, nor yet whole Congregations (as we above observed) are to be measured by the Acts of God's Conde∣sension in times of Ignorance. But besides, it hath often-times fallen out, that God, having a regard to the Simplicity and Integrity either of the Preacher or Hearers, hath fallen in upon the Heart of a Preacher by his Power and Holy In∣fluence, and thereby hath led him to speak things which were not in his Premeditated Discourse, and which perhaps he never thought of before: And those passing Ejaculations and Unpremedita∣ted, but Living Exhortations, have proved more Beneficial and Refreshful both to Preacher and Hearers, than all their premeditated Sermons. But all that will not allow them to continue in these things, which in themselves are not approved; but contrary to the Practice of the Apostles, when God is raising up a People to serve him, according to the Primitive Purity and Spirituality; yea, such Acts of God's Condesension, in times of Dark∣ness and Ignorance should engage all more and more to follow him, according as he reveals his most <HI>perfect</HI> and <HI>spiritual Way.</HI></P>

<P N="21"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>II.</HI> Of <HI>Prayer,</HI> how the Outward is distin∣guished from the Inward.</NOTE>§. XXI. Having hitherto spoken of <HI>Preaching</HI>; now it is fit to speak of <HI>Praying,</HI> concerning which the like Controversie ariseth. Our Adversaries, whose <HI>Religion</HI> is all for the most part <HI>outside,</HI> and such whose Acts are the meer product of Man's natural Will and Abilities; as they can Preach, so can they Pray when they please, and therefore have their set particular Prayers. I meddle not with the Controversies among themselves concerning this; some of them being for <HI>set Prayers,</HI> as a <HI>Liturgy</HI>; others for such as are conceived <HI>extempore</HI>: It suf∣fices me, that all of them agree in this, That the Motions and Influence of the Spirit of God, are not necessary to be previous thereunto;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Priests</HI> set times to Preach and Pray, deny the Spirit.</NOTE> and therefore they have <HI>set times</HI> in their publick Worship, as be∣fore and after Preaching, and in their private De∣votion, as Morning and Evening, and before and af∣ter Meat, and other such occasions; at which they precisely set about the performing of their Pray∣ers, by speaking words to God, whether they feel any Motion or Influence of the Spirit, or not: So that some of the chiefest have confessed, that they have thus prayed, without the Motions and As∣sistance of the Spirit, acknowledging, that they sinned in so doing; yet they said, they look'd upon it as their Duty to do so, tho' to pray without the Spirit be sin. We freely confess, that <HI>Prayer</HI> is both very profitable, and a necessary Duty com∣manded, and fit to be practised frequently by all Christians: But as we can do nothing without Christ, so neither can we Pray, without the Con∣currence and Assistance of his Spirit. But, that the State of the Controversie may be the better understood, let it be considered, <HI>First,</HI> That <HI>Prayer</HI> is twofold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What In∣ward <HI>Pray∣er</HI> is?</NOTE> <HI>Inward</HI> and <HI>Outward. Inward Prayer</HI> is that <HI>secret turning of the Mind towards God,</HI> where∣by, being secretly touched and awakened by the <HI>Light of Christ</HI> in the Conscience, and so bowed down under the sense of its Iniquities, Unworthi∣ness

and Misery, it looks up to God; and joining issue with the secret shinings of the Seed of God, it breathes towards him, and is constantly breathing forth some secret Desires and Aspirations towards him. It is in this sense, that we are so frequent∣ly in Scripture commanded to <HI>Pray continually, Luke</HI> 18.1. 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 5.17. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.18. <HI>Luke</HI> 21.36. Which cannot be understood of <HI>outward Prayer</HI>; because it were impossible, that Men should be al∣ways upon their Knees, expressing <HI>words of Prayer</HI>; and this would hinder them from the Exercise of those <HI>Duties,</HI> no less positively commanded.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Out∣ward <HI>Pray∣er</HI> is?</NOTE> <HI>Out∣ward Proyer</HI> is, when as the Spirit (being thus in the Exercise of Inward Retirement, and feeling the Breathing of the Spirit of God to arise power∣fully in the Soul) receives Strength and Liberty, by a superadded Motion and Influence of the Spirit, to bring forth either audible <HI>Sighs, Groans,</HI> or <HI>Words,</HI> and that either in publick Assemblies, or in private, or at Meat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As then <HI>Inward Prayer is necessary at all times,</HI> so,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Inward Prayer</HI> ne∣cessary at all times.</NOTE> so long as the Day of every Man's <HI>Visitation</HI> lasteth, he never wants some Influence, less or more, for the Practise of it; because he no sooner retires his Mind, and considers himself in God's Presence, but he finds himself in the Practise of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Outward Exercise</HI> of <HI>Prayer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Outward Prayer</HI> doth re∣quire a su∣per added Influence.</NOTE> as needing a greater and superadded Influence and Motion of the Spirit, as it cannot be continually practised, so neither can it be so readily, so as to be effectually performed, until his Mind be sometime acquainted with the <HI>Inward</HI>; therefore such as are diligent and watchful in their Minds, and much retired in the Exercise of this <HI>Inward Prayer,</HI> are more capable to be frequent in the use of the <HI>Outward,</HI> because that this holy Influence doth more constantly at∣tend them, and they being better acquainted with, and accustomed to the Motions of God's Spirit, can easily perceive and discern them. And indeed,
<PB N="394" REF="003129_0204_0FF005CA432C6C78"/>
as such who are most diligent have a near access to God, and he taketh most delight to draw them by his Spirit, to approach and call upon him; so when many are gathered together in this watchful Mind, God doth frequently pour forth the Spirit of Pray∣er among them, and stir them thereunto, to the Edifying and Building up of one another in <HI>Love.</HI> But because this <HI>Outward Prayer</HI> depends upon the <HI>Inward,</HI> as that which must follow it, and cannot be acceptably performed, but as attended with a superadded Influence and Motion of the Spirit, therefore cannot we prefix set Times to <HI>Pray outwardly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">We cannot fix set times to Speak and Pray, to tempt God.</NOTE> so as to lay a necessity to speak words at such and such times, whether we feel this Hea∣venly Influence and Assistance, or no; for that we judge were a tempting of God, and a coming be∣fore him without due <HI>Preparation.</HI> We think it fit for us to present our selves before him by this <HI>Inward Retirement</HI> of the <HI>Mind,</HI> and so to proceed further, as his Spirit shall help us and draw us thereunto: And we find, that the Lord accepts of this, yea, and seeth meet sometimes to exercise us in this silent Place, for the trial of our <HI>Patience,</HI> without allowing us to speak further; that he may teach us nor to rely upon outward <HI>Performance,</HI> or satisfie our selves, as too many do, with the say∣ing of our <HI>Prayers</HI>; and that our dependence upon him may be the more firm and constant, to wait for the holding out of this Scepter, and for his al∣lowance to draw near unto him, and with great freedom and enlargement of Spirit upon our <HI>Hearts</HI> towards him. Yet nevertheless we do not deny, but sometimes God, upon particular Occasions very suddenly, yea, upon the the very first turning in of the <HI>Mind,</HI> may give Power and Liberty to bring forth Words or Acts of <HI>outward Prayer,</HI> so as the Soul can scarce discern any previous motion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Such sin as are neglect∣ing Prayer.</NOTE> but the influence and bringing forth thereof may be as it were, <HI>simul &amp; semel</HI>; nevertheless that saying of

And therefore we question not, but many, through neglect of this Inward Watchfulness and Retiredness of Mind, miss many precious opportunities to <HI>Pray,</HI> and thereby are guilty in the sight of God; yet would they Sin, if they should set about the Act, until they first felt the Influence. For as he grosly offends his <HI>Master,</HI> that lieth in his Bed and sleeps,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Forward and a Care∣less Servant answers not his Duty.</NOTE> and neglects to do his <HI>Master's Business</HI>; yet if such an one should sud∣denly get up, without putting on his Cloaths, or taking along with him those necessary Tools and Instruments, without which he could not possibly Work, and should forwardly fall a doing to no pur∣pose, he would be so far thereby from repairing his former Fault, that he would justly incur a new Cen∣sure: And as one that is Careless, and other ways Busied, may miss to hear one speaking unto him, or even not hear the Bell of a Clock, tho' striking hard by him; so may many through Negligence, miss to hear God often times calling upon them, and giving them access to Pray unto him: Yet will not that allow them, without his liberty, in their own Wills to fall to Work.</P>
<P>And <HI>lastly:</HI> Tho' this be the only true and pro∣per Method of Prayer, as that which is alone ac∣ceptable to God; yet shall we not deny, but he often-times answered the Prayers, and concurred with the Desires of some,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In times of Darkness God did often hear their Pray∣ers.</NOTE> especially in Times of Darkness, who have greatly erred herein, so that some that have sat down in <HI>formal Prayer,</HI> tho' far wrong in the Matter as well as Manner, without the Assistance or Influence of God's Spirit; yet have found him to take occasion there-through to

break in upon their Souls, and wonderfully tender and refresh them: Yet, as in <HI>Preaching,</HI> and else∣where, hath afore been observed, that will not prove any such practices, or be a just Let to hinder any from coming to practise that pure, Spiritual and Acceptable Prayer, which God is again restoring, and leading his People into, out of all Superstitions &amp; meer empty Formalities.

<P N="22"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I.</HI> God's Spirit must be felt to move the Mind to <HI>Prayer.</HI></NOTE>§. XXII. And <HI>First,</HI> That there is a necessity of this <HI>inward Retirement</HI> of the Mind, as previous to <HI>Prayer,</HI> that the Spirit may be felt to draw thereunto, appears, for that in most of those places, where <HI>Prayer</HI> is commanded, <HI>Watching</HI> is prefixed there∣unto, as necessary to go before; as <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.42. <HI>Mark</HI> 13.33. &amp; 14 38. <HI>Luke</HI> 21.36. from which it is evident, that this <HI>Watching</HI> was to go before <HI>Prayer.</HI> Now to what end is this <HI>Watching,</HI> or what is it, but a waiting to feel <HI>God's Spirit</HI> to draw unto <HI>Prayer,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 6.18.</NOTE> that so it may be done acceptably? For since we are to <HI>Pray always in the Spirit,</HI> and cannot <HI>pray</HI> of our selves without it acceptably, this <HI>Watch∣ing</HI> must be for this end recommended to us, as preceding <HI>Prayer,</HI> that we may Watch and Wait for the seasonable time to Pray, which is when the Spirit moves thereunto.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>II.</HI> We know not how to <HI>pray,</HI> but as the Spi∣rit helps.</NOTE><HI>Secondly,</HI> This Necessity of the Spirit's moving and concurrence, appears abundantly from that of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. 8.26, 27. <HI>Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our Infirmities: For we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit it self maketh intercession for us, with Groanings which cannot be ut∣tered.

<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>III. Pray</HI> al∣ways in the Spirit, and Watching thereunto.</NOTE> This necessity of the Spirit to true Prayer, appears from <HI>Ephesians</HI> 6.18. and <HI>Jude</HI> 20. where the Apostle commands <HI>to pray always in the Spirit, and watching thereunto</HI>; which is as much, as if he had said, that we were never to pray with∣out the Spirit, or watching thereunto. And <HI>Jude</HI> sheweth us, that such Prayers as are <HI>in the Holy Ghost,</HI> only tend to the <HI>building up of our selves in our most holy Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI>; The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> saith expresly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>IV.</HI> Man can∣not call Christ <HI>Lord,</HI> but by the Holy Ghost.</NOTE> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.3. <HI>That no Man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost:</HI> If then Jesus cannot be thus rightly named, <HI>but by the Holy Ghost</HI>; far less can he be acceptably called upon. Hence the same Apostle
<PB N="398" REF="003129_0206_0FF005CED1A7CE50"/>
declares, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.15. that he <HI>will pray with the Spi∣rit,</HI> &amp;c. A clear evidence, that it was none of his method to pray without it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>V.</HI> God will not hear the Prayers of the Wick∣ed.</NOTE>But <HI>Fifthly</HI>; All <HI>Prayer</HI> without the Spirit is <HI>Abo∣mination,</HI> such as are the <HI>Prayers of the Wicked,</HI> Prov. 28.9 And the <HI>Confidence</HI> that the Saints have, that <HI>God will hear them,</HI> is, if they <HI>ask any thing according to his Will,</HI> 1 John 5.14. So if the Prayer be not ac∣cording to his Will, there is no ground of Confi∣dence that he will hear. Now our Adversaries will acknowledge, that Prayers without the Spirit are not according to the Will of God; and therefore such as pray without it, have no ground to expect an answer: For indeed to bid a Man <HI>pray</HI> without the <HI>Spirit,</HI> is all one, as to bid one <HI>see</HI> without <HI>Eyes, work</HI> without <HI>Hands,</HI> or <HI>go</HI> without <HI>Feet.</HI> And to desire a Man to fall to Prayer, ere the Spirit, in some measure, less or more, move him thereunto, is to desire a Man to see, before he opens his Eyes; or to walk, before he rises up; or to work with his Hands, before he moves them.</P>
<P N="23"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>VI.</HI> All Sacri∣fice is Sin, not offer'd by the Spirit</NOTE>§. XXIII. But <HI>lastly.</HI> From this false Opinion of Praying without the Spirit, and not judging it ne∣cessary to be waited for, as that which may be felt to move us thereunto, hath proceeded all the Su∣perstition and Idolatry that is among those called <HI>Christians,</HI> and those many Abominations where∣with the <HI>Lord</HI> is <HI>provoked,</HI> and his <HI>Spirit grieved:</HI> So that many deceive themselves now, as the <HI>Jews</HI> did of old, thinking it sufficient, if they pay their daily Sacrifices, and offer their customary Oblati∣ons; from thence thinking all this well, and creating a false Peace to themselves, as the <HI>Whore</HI> in the <HI>Proverbs</HI>; because they have offered up their Sa∣crifices of Morning and Evening Prayers. And therefore it's manifest, that their constant use of things doth not a whit influence their Lives and Conversations; but they remain for the most part as bad as ever.

<HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Protestants,</HI> for them first to leap, as it were, out of their vain, light and profane Con∣versations, at their <HI>set hours</HI> and <HI>seasons,</HI> and fall to their customary Devotion; and then, when it is scarce finished, and the Words to God scarce out, the former profane Talk comes after it: So that the same wicked profane Spirit of this World acts them in both. If there be any such thing as <HI>vain Oblations,</HI> or <HI>Prayers that are Abomination,</HI> which God heareth not, (as is certain there are, and the Scripture testifies, <HI>Isai.</HI> 66.3. <HI>Jer.</HI> 14.12.) certainly such Prayers, as are acted in Man's Will, and by his own Strength, without God's Spirit, must be of that number.</P>
<P N="24">§. XXIV. Let this suffice for Probation. Now I shall proceed to answer their Objections,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Concerning</HI> Joining in Prayer <HI>with others</HI></NOTE> when I have said something concerning <HI>Joining in Prayer with others.</HI> Those that Pray together with one accord, use not only to concur in their Spirits, but also in the Gesture of their Body; which we also will willingly approve of. It becometh those, who approach before God to <HI>pray,</HI> that they do it with <HI>bowed Knees,</HI> and with their <HI>Heads uncovered</HI>; which is our Practice.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="1"/> But here ariseth a Controversie, <HI>Whether it be Lawful to join with others (by those external Signs of Reverence, albeit not in Heart) who pray formally, not waiting for the Motion of the Spirit, nor judging it necessary?</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> We answer; Not at all: And for our Testimo∣ny in this thing we have suffered not a little. For when it hath fallen out, that either accidentally,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How with Idolaters we cannot <HI>Join in Prayer.</HI></NOTE> or to witness against their Worship, we have been present during the same, and have not found it lawful for us to <HI>bow</HI> with them thereunto, they have often persecuted us, not only with Re∣proaches, but also with Stroaks and cruel Beat∣ings. For this cause they use to accuse us of Pride, Profanity and Madness, as if we had no
<PB N="400" REF="003129_0207_0FF005D1CCFFA300"/>
Respect or Reverence to the <HI>Worship of God,</HI> and as if we judged none could pray, or were heard of God but our selves. Unto all which, and many more Reproaches of this kind, we <HI>answer</HI> briefly and modestly; That it sufficeth us that we are found so doing, neither through Pride, nor Madness, nor Profanity; but meerly lest we should hurt our <HI>Consciences</HI>: The reason of which, is plain and evident; for since our <HI>Principle</HI> and <HI>Doctrine</HI> oblige us to believe, that the <HI>Prayers</HI> of those, who themselves confess they are <HI>not acted by the Spi∣rit,</HI> are <HI>Abominations,</HI> how can we, with a safe Con∣science, joyn with them?</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="2"/> If they urge, <HI>That this is the height of Unchari∣tablenss and Arrogancy; as if we judged our selves al∣ways to pray by the Spirit's Motion, but they never; as if we were never deceived by Praying without the Motions of the Spirit, and that they were never acted by it: See∣ing a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it they judged not the Motion of the Spirit always necessary, they Confess nevertheless that it is very profi∣table and comfortable, and they feel it often influen∣cing them; which that it sometimes falls out, we cannot deny.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> To all which I answer distinctly: If it were their known and avowed <HI>Doctrine,</HI> not to pray without the motion of the Spirit, and that seriously hold∣ing thereunto, they did not bind themselves to Pray at certain <HI>prescribed Times</HI> precisely (at which times they determine to Pray, tho' without the Spirit) then indeed we might be accused of Un∣charitableness and Pride, if we never joined with them; and if they so taught and practised, I doubt not but it should be lawful for us so to do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shall we confirm the <HI>Hypocrite,</HI> when <HI>pray∣ing.</HI></NOTE> un∣less there should appear some manifest and evi∣dent Hypocrisie and Delusion. But seeing they confess, that they <HI>pray without the Spirit,</HI> and seeing God hath perswaded us, that such Prayers are <HI>abo∣minable,</HI> how can we with a safe Conscience join with an <HI>Abomination</HI>? That God sometimes conde∣scends
<PB N="401" REF="003129_0207_0FF005D1CCFFA300"/>
to them, we do not deny (albeit now when the <HI>Spiritual Worship</HI> is openly proclaimed, and all are invited unto it, the case is otherwise, than in those old times of Apostasie and Darkness) and therefore, albeit any should begin to pray in our presence, not expecting the Motion of the Spirit; yet if it manifestly appear that God in condescen∣sion did concur with such a one, then according to God's Will, we should not refuse to join also; but this is rare, lest thence they should be con∣firmed in their false Principle. And albeit this seem hard in our Profession, neverthess it is so confirmed by the Authority both of Scripture and right Reason, that many convinced thereof have embraced this part before other <HI>Truths</HI> which were easier, and as they seemed to some, clearer. Among whom is memorable of late Years <HI>Alexander Skein</HI> a Magistrate of the City of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> a Man very mo∣dest, and very averse from giving offence to others; who nevertheless being overcome by the Power of Truth in this matter, behoved for this cause to se∣parate himself from the publick Assemblies and Prayers, and join himself unto us. Who also gave the reason of his Change, and likewise succinctly, but yet substantially, comprehended this Contro∣versie, concerning <HI>Worship,</HI> in some short Questions, which he offer'd to the publick Preachers of the <HI>City,</HI> and I think meet to insert in this place.</P>
<P N="1">1.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Query.</NOTE> <HI>Whether or not should any Act of God's Worship be gone about, without the Motions, Leadings and Act∣ings of the Holy Spirit?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some Que∣stions of <HI>A. Skein,</HI> pro∣posed to the Preach∣ers of <HI>Aber∣deen.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If the Motions of the Spirit be necessary to every particular Duty, whether should he be waited upon, that all our Acts and Words may be according as he gives utterance and assistance?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Whether every one that hears the Name of a</HI> Chri∣stian, <HI>or professes to be a</HI> Protestant, <HI>hath such an un∣interrupted measure thereof, that he may, without wait∣ing, go immediately about the Duty?</HI></P>
<PB N="402" REF="003129_0208_0FF005D38BD51938"/>
<P N="4">4. <HI>If there be an indisposition and unfitness at some times for such Exercises, at least as to the Spiritual and Lively Performances thereof, whether ought they to be performed in that Case, and at that Time?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>If any Duty be gone about, under pretence that it is in obedience to the External Command, without the Spiritual Life and Motion necessary; whether such a Duty, thus performed, can in Faith be expected to be accepted of God, and not rather reckoned as a bringing of strange Fire before the Lord;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Levit. 16.1.</NOTE> <HI>seeing it is performed (at best) by the strength of natural and acquired Parts, and not by the strength and assistance of the Holy Ghost; which was typified by the Fire that came down from Hea∣ven, which alone behoved to consume the Sacrifice, and no other?</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Whether Duties, gone about in the meer strength of natural and acquired Parts (whether in publick or private) be not as really, upon the matter, an Image of Man's Invention, as the</HI> Popish <HI>Worship, tho' not so gross in the outward appearance? And therefore whether it be not as real Superstition to countenance any Worship of that nature, as it is to countenance</HI> Popish <HI>Worship, tho' there be a difference in the degree?</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Whether it be a ground of Offence, or just Scan∣dal, to countenance the Worship of those, whose professed Principle it is, neither to speak for Edification, nor to pray, but as the Holy Ghost shall be pleased to assist them, in some measure, less or more; without which they rather choose to be silent, than to speak without this In∣fluence?</HI></P>
<P>Unto these they answered but very coldly and faintly; whose Answers likewise long ago he re∣futed.</P>
<P>Seeing then God hath called us to his Spiritual Worship, and to testifie against the Humane and Voluntary Worships of the Apostasy, if we did not this way stand Immoveable to the <HI>Truth</HI> re∣vealed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We must not lose our Witnessing for God.</NOTE> but should join with them, both our Te∣stimony for God would be weakned and lost, and
<PB N="403" REF="003129_0208_0FF005D38BD51938"/>
it would be impossible steadily to Propagate this Worship in the World, whose progress we dare neither retard nor hinder by any Act of ours; tho' therefore we shall lose not only Worldly Honour, but even our Lives. And truly many <HI>Protestants,</HI> through their unsteadness in this thing, for poli∣tick ends, complying with the <HI>Popish Abominations,</HI> have greatly scandalized their Profession, and hurt the Reformation: As appeared in the Example of the <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Saxony</HI>; who,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Elector of <HI>Saxony,</HI> his Scandal given to Protestants</NOTE> in the Convention at <HI>Augsburg,</HI> in the Year 1530, being commanded by the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, to be present at the <HI>Mass</HI> that he might carry the Sword before him, according to his place; which when he justly scrupled to perform, his Preachers taking more care for their Prince's Honour, than for his Con∣science, perswaded him that it was lawful to do it against his Conscience. Which was both a very bad Example, and great scandal to the Reforma∣tion, and displeased many;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Secondly</HI>: Objections against Spiritual Prayer, an∣swer'd</NOTE> as the Author of the <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trent,</HI> in his First Book, well observes. But now I hasten to the Objections of our Adversaries, against this Method of Pray∣ing.</P>
<P N="25"><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="1"/> §. XXV. <HI>First</HI>; They Object, <HI>That if such particu∣lar Influences were needful to outward Acts of Worship, then they should also be needful to inward Acts, to wit, desire and love to God:</HI></P>
<P><HI>But this is absurd; Therefore also that from whence it follows.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; That which was said in the <HI>State</HI> of the <HI>Controversie,</HI> cleareth this; because as to those general Duties, there never wants an Influence, so long as the Day of a Man's Visitation la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth; du∣ring which time, <HI>God is always near</HI> to him, and <HI>wrestling</HI> with him by his Spirit, to turn him to himself; so that, if he do but stand still, and cease from his evil thoughts, the Lord is near to help him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But as to the outward Acts of Prayer,
<PB N="404" REF="003129_0209_0FF005D5EEF20160"/>
they need a more speicial Motion and Influence, as hath been proved.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="2"/> <HI>Secondly</HI>; They object, <HI>That it might be also alledg∣ed, that Men ought not to do moral Duties, as Children to honour their Parents, Men to do right to their Neighbours, except the Spirit move them to it.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; There is a great difference betwixt these General Duties, betwixt Man and Man, and the particular express Acts of Worship towards God: The one is meerly Spiritual, and commanded by God to be performed by his Spirit; the other answer their End, as to them, whom they are im∣mediately directed to, and concern, tho' done from a meer natural Principle of Self love: Even as Beasts have natural Affections one to another, and there∣fore may be thus performed. Tho' I shall not deny, but that they are not Works accepted of God, or beneficial to the Soul, but as they are done in the Fear of God, and in his Blessing, in which his Chil∣dren do all things; and therefore are accepted and blessed in whatsoever they do.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="3"/> <HI>Thirdly</HI>; They Object, <HI>That if a wicked Man ought not to pray without a Motion of the Spirit, because his Prayer would be sinful; neither ought he to plow by the same reason,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 21.4.</NOTE> <HI>because the</HI> plowing of the wicked, <HI>as well as his praying,</HI> is sin.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> This Objection is of the same Nature with the former, and therefore may be answered the same way;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Acts of Nature differ from the Spirit's.</NOTE> seeing there is a great difference betwixt Na∣tural Acts, such as <HI>eating, drinking sleeping,</HI> and <HI>seeking Sustenance for the Body,</HI> (which things Man hath com∣mon with Beasts) and Spiritual Acts. And it doth not follow, because Man ought not to go about <HI>Spiritual Acts</HI> without the Spirit, that therefore he may not go about <HI>Natural Acts</HI> without it: The Analogy holds better thus, and that for the proof of our Affirmation, That as Man, for the going about Natural Acts, needs his Natural Spirit; so to perform Spiritual Acts, he needs the Spirit of
<PB N="405" REF="003129_0209_0FF005D5EEF20160"/>
God. That the <HI>Natural Acts</HI> of the Wicked and Unregenerate are <HI>sinful,</HI> is not denied; tho' not as in themselves, but in so far as Man in that state is in all things reprobated in the sight of God.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="4"/> <HI>Fourthly</HI>; They object, <HI>That wicked Men may, ac∣cording to this Doctrine, forbear to pray for Years to∣gether, alledging, they want a Motion to it.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; The false pretences of wicked Men do nothing invalidate the Truth of this Doctrine; for at that rate there is no Doctrine of Christ, which Men might not turn by. That <HI>they ought not to pray without the Spirit,</HI> is granted; but then they ought to come to that place of <HI>watching,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">That wick∣ed Men ne∣glect the Motions of the Spirit to pray.</NOTE> where they may be capable to feel the Spirit's Motion. They <HI>sin</HI> indeed in not <HI>Praying</HI>; but the cause of this Sin is their not <HI>Watching</HI>: So their neglect proceeds not from this Doctrine, but from there disobedience to it; seeing if they did pray without this, it would be a double Sin, and no ful∣filling of the Command to Pray: Nor yet would then <HI>Prayer,</HI> without this Spirit, be useful unto them. And this our Adversaries are forced to acknowlegde in another case. For they say, <HI>It is a Duty incumbent on Christians to frequent the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper</HI> (as they call it;) Yet they say, <HI>No Man ought to take it unworthily</HI>: Yet they plead, that such as find themselves unprepared, must ab∣stain; and therefore do usually <HI>Excommunicate</HI> them from the Table. Now, tho' according to them, it be necessary to partake of this Sacrament; yet it is also necessary, that those that do it, do first ex∣amine themselves, lest they eat and drink their own Condemnation: And tho' they reckon it <HI>sin∣ful</HI> for them to forbear, yet they account it more <HI>sinful</HI> for them to do it, without this Examina∣tion.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="5"/> <HI>Fifthly</HI>; They object, <HI>Acts</HI> 8.22. <HI>where</HI> Peter <HI>com∣manded</HI> Simon Magus, <HI>that wicked Sorcerer, to pray</HI>;
<PB N="406" REF="003129_0210_0FF005D971C31AF0"/>
from thence inferring, <HI>That wicked Men may and ought to Pray.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; That in the citing of this place, as I have often observed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Sorce∣rer</HI> may pray, but not with∣out <HI>Repen∣tance.</HI></NOTE> they omit the first and chief∣est part of the verse, which is thus, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. v. 22. <HI>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee:</HI> So here he bids him first <HI>Repent.</HI> Now the least measure of true Repentance cannot be with∣out somewhat of that inward Retirement of the Mind, which we speak of: And indeed, where true Repentance goeth first, we do not doubt but the Spirit of God will be near to concur with, and influence such, to pray to, and call upon God.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="6"/> And <HI>Lastly</HI>; They Object, <HI>That many Prayers be∣gun without the Spirit, have proved Effectual; and that the Prayers of wicked Men have been heard, and found acceptable, as</HI> Ahab<HI>'s.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> This Objection was before solved. For the Acts of God's Compassion and Indulgence, at some times, and to some persons, upon singular extraordinary occasions, are not to be a Rule of our actions. For if we should make that the measure of our Obedience, great Inconveniences would follow; as is evident, and will be acknowledged by all. <HI>Next,</HI> We do not deny, but wicked Men are sensible of the Motions and Operations of God's Spirit often∣times, before their day be expired; from which they may at times pray acceptably; not as re∣maining altogether Wicked, but as entering into Piety, from whence they afterwards fall away.</P>
<P N="26"><NOTE PLACE="marg">III.</NOTE>§. XXVI. As to the <HI>Singing of Psalms,</HI> there will not be need of ay long Discourse;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of</HI> Singing Psalms.</NOTE> for that the case is just the same as in the two former, of <HI>Preaching and Praying.</HI> We confess this to be a part of God's Worship, and very sweet and re∣freshful, when it proceeds from a true sense of God's Love in the Heart, and arises from the Di∣vine Influence of the Spirit, which leads Souls to

As where they will sing sometimes, <HI>Psalm</HI> 22.14—<HI>My Heart is like Wax, it is melted in the midst of my Bowels:</HI> And verse 15. <HI>My strength is dried up like a Potsheard, and my Tongue cleaveth to my Jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of Death</HI>: And <HI>Psalm</HI> 6.6. <HI>I am weary with my groaning, all the night make I my bed to swim: I water my couch with my tears:</HI> And many more, which those that speak, know to be false, as to them. And sometimes will confess just after in their Prayers, that they are guilty of the Vices opposite to those Vertues, which but just before they have asserted them∣selves endued with.

<P>That <HI>Singing</HI> then, that pleaseth him, must pro∣ceed from that which is <HI>PURE in the Heart</HI> (even from the <HI>Word of Life</HI> therein) in and by which, richly dwelling in us, <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> and <HI>Hymns</HI> are returned to the Lord, according to that of the Ap∣stle, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.16.</P>

<P N="27">§. XXVII.

Whereas the Worship of our Adver∣saries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Canal Worship pleases Self.</NOTE> being performed in their own wills, is self-pleasing, as in which they can largely exercise their Natural Parts and Invention: And so (as to most of them) having somewhat of an outward and worldly Splendor, delectable to the carnal and worldly Senses, they can pleasantly continue it, and satisfie themselves; tho' without the Spirit and Power, which they make no ways Essential to the performance of their Worship, and therefore nei∣ther wait for, nor expect it.</P>

<P N="2">§. II.

Ingratiate themselves, and the more easily gain the <HI>Heathens</HI> to their <HI>Religion</HI>; which practise, tho' perhaps intended by them for good, yet, as be∣ing the fruit of <HI>Humane Policy,</HI> and not accord∣ing to <HI>God's Wisdom,</HI> has had very pernicious Con∣sequences. I see not, how any, whether <HI>Papists</HI> or <HI>Protestants,</HI> especially the latter, can in reason quar∣rel with us for denying this Term, which it seems the Spirit of God saw not meet to inspire the Pen men of the Scriptures to leave unto us.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="1"/> But if it be said, That <HI>it is not the Name, but the Thing they contend for:</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I <HI>Answer:</HI> Let the Name then, as not being <HI>Scrip∣tural,</HI> be laid aside, and we shall see at first entrance, how much Benefit will redound by laying aside this Traditional Term, and betaking us to plain∣ness of <HI>Scripture Language.</HI> For presently the great Contest, about the number of them, will vanish; seeing there is no Term used in Scripture, that can be made use of, whether we call them <HI>Institu∣tions, Ordinances, Precepts, Commandments, Appoint∣ments,</HI> or <HI>Laws,</HI> &amp;c. that would afford ground for such a Debate; since neither will <HI>Papist</HI> affirm, that there are only <HI>Seven,</HI> or <HI>Protestants</HI> only <HI>Two,</HI> of any of these afore-mentioned.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="2"/> If it be said, That this <HI>Controversie arises from the Definition of the Thing, as well as from the Name.</HI></P>

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="3"/> If it be said, <HI>It is so to them that are faithful.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer: So is Praying and Preaching, and do∣ing of every good Work: Seeing the partaking or performing of the one, gives not to any a more certain Title to Heaven, yea (in some respect) not so much, there is no Reason to call them so, more than the other.</P>
<P>Besides, we find not any thing called the <HI>Seal</HI> and <HI>Pledge</HI> of our <HI>Inheritance,</HI> but the <HI>Spirit of God</HI>; it is by that we are said to be <HI>sealed,</HI> Eph. 1.14. &amp; 4.30. which is also termed the <HI>Earnest of our In∣heritance,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.22. and not by <HI>outward Water,</HI> or <HI>Eating</HI> and <HI>Drinking</HI>; which, as the Wickedest of Men may partake of, so many that do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That out∣ward Wash∣ing doth not cleanse the Heart.</NOTE> do notwith∣standing it, go to Perdition.

What is said here in general, may serve for an Introduction, not only to this Proposition, but also to the other concerning the <HI>Supper.</HI> Of these <HI>Sacraments</HI> (so called) <HI>Baptism</HI> is always first numbered, which is the Subject of the present Proposition; in whose Explanation I shall first demonstrate and prove our Judgment; and then Answer the Objections, and Refute the Sentiments of our Opposers.

<P N="3">§. III. First: <HI>That there is but one Baptism,</HI> <MILESTONE UNIT="Prop." N="I"/> as well as but one Lord, one Faith, <HI>&amp;c..</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That this one Baptism,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">II.</NOTE> <HI>which is the Baptism of Christ, is not a washing with, or dipping in Water, but a being Baptized by the Spirit.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">III.</NOTE>Thirdly, <HI>That the Baptism of</HI> John <HI>was but a Fi∣gure of this; and therefore, as the Figure, to give place to the Substance; which, tho' it be to continue, yet the other is ceased.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Prop." N="I"/> As for the <HI>first,</HI> viz. <HI>That there is but one Baptism,</HI> there needs no other proof, than the words of the Text,<NOTE PLACE="marg">One Bap∣tism prov'd</NOTE> <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.5. <HI>One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism:</HI> where the Apostle positively and plainly affirms, that as there is but <HI>one Body, one Spirit, one Faith, one God,</HI> &amp;c. so there is but <HI>One Baptism.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="1"/> As to what is commonly alledged, by way of Explanation upon the Text, <HI>That the Baptism of Water and of the Spirit make up this One Baptism, by vertue of the Sacramental Union.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; This Exposition hath taken place, not because grounded upon the Testimony of the Scrip∣ture, but because it wrests the Scripture to make it suit to their Principle of <HI>Water Baptism</HI>; and so there needs no other reply, but to deny it, as being repugnant to the plain words of the Text; which saith not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether <HI>Two Bap∣tisms</HI> make up the <HI>One.</HI></NOTE> <HI>that there are two Baptisms,</HI> to wit, one of <HI>Water,</HI> the other of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which do make up <HI>One Baptism</HI>; but plainly, <HI>that there is one Baptism,</HI> as there is <HI>One Faith,</HI> and <HI>One God.</HI> Now there go∣eth not <HI>two Faiths,</HI> nor <HI>two Gods,</HI> nor <HI>two Spirits,</HI> nor <HI>two Bodies,</HI> whereof the one is Outward and Elementary, and the other Spiritual and Pure, to the making up of the <HI>one Faith,</HI> the <HI>one God,</HI> the <HI>one Body,</HI> and the <HI>one Spirit</HI>; so neither ought there to go <HI>Two Baptisms</HI> to make up <HI>the One Baptism.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="2"/> But <HI>secondly,</HI> if it be said, <HI>The Baptism is but one, whereof Water is the one part, to wit, the sign; and the Spirit, the thing signified, the other.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; This yet more confirmeth our Doct∣rine:<NOTE PLACE="marg">If <HI>Water</HI> be the Type, the <HI>Substance</HI> must re∣main.</NOTE> For if Water be only the <HI>sign,</HI> it is not the matter of the <HI>one Baptism</HI> (as shall further hereafter by its Definition in Scripture appear) and we are to take the <HI>one Baptism</HI> for the <HI>matter</HI> of it, not for the <HI>sign,</HI> or <HI>figure</HI> and <HI>type,</HI> that went
<PB N="415" REF="003129_0214_0FF005E48CEDA588"/>
before. Even as where Christ is called the <HI>One Of∣fering</HI> in Scripture, tho' he was typified by many <HI>Sacrifices</HI> and <HI>Offerings</HI> under the Law, we under∣stand only by the <HI>one Offering,</HI> his offering himself upon the Cross; whereof tho' those many <HI>Offerings</HI> were Signs and Types; yet we say not, that they go together with that <HI>Offering of Christ,</HI> to make up the <HI>one Offering:</HI> So neither, tho' <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> was a sign of <HI>Christ's Baptism,</HI> will it not follow, that it goeth now to make up the <HI>Baptism of Christ.</HI> If any should be so absurd, as to affirm, <HI>That this One Baptism here, was the Baptism of Water, and not of the Spirit:</HI> That were foolishly to contradict the posi∣tive Testimony of the Scripture, which saith the contrary; as by what followeth will more amply appear.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Prop." N="II:"/> Secondly; <HI>That this</HI> One Baptism, <HI>which is the Baptism of Christ, is not a Washing with Water,</HI> appears, <HI>first,</HI> from the Testimony of <HI>John,</HI> <MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="I"/> the proper and peculiar Administrator of Water-Baptism, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.11. <HI>I indeed baptize you with water unto Repentance;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The differ∣ence be∣tween <HI>John</HI>'s Bap∣tism, and <HI>Christ's.</HI></NOTE> <HI>but he that cometh after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with Fire.</HI> Here <HI>John</HI> mentions two manner of <HI>Baptisms,</HI> and two different <HI>Bap∣tisms</HI>; the one with Water, and the other with the Spirit; the one whereof, he was the Minister of; the other whereof, Christ was the Minister of: And such as were baptized with the first, were not therefore baptized with the second: <HI>I indeed bap∣tize you, but he shall baptize you.</HI> Tho' in the present time they were baptized with the Baptism of Wa∣ter; yet they were not as yet, but were to be, baptized with the Baptism of Christ. From all which, I thus ague:</P>
<P><LIST TYPE="syllogism">
<HEAD>Arg. 1.</HEAD>
<ITEM>If those that were baptized with the Baptism of Water, were not therefore baptized with the Bap∣tism of Christ; then the Baptism of Water is not the Baptism of Christ:</ITEM>
<PB N="416" REF="003129_0215_0FF005E644CFF2E8"/>
<ITEM>But the <HI>first</HI> is true;</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore also the <HI>last.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
And again,
<LIST TYPE="syllogism"><HEAD>Arg. 2.</HEAD>
<ITEM>If he, that truly and really administred the Bap∣tism of Water, did notwithstanding declare; that he neither could, nor did baptize with the Baptism of Christ; then the Baptism of Water is not the Baptism of Christ:</ITEM>
<ITEM>But the <HI>first</HI> is true;</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And indeed to understand it otherwise, would make <HI>John</HI>'s words void of good sense: For if their Baptisms had been all one, why should he have so precisely contra-distinguished them? Why should he have said, that those, whom he had already baptized, should yet be baptized by another Bap∣tism?</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If it be urged, <HI>That Baptism with Water was the one part, and that with the Spirit the other part or effect only of the former.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; This Exposition contradicts the plain words of the Text. For he saith not, <HI>I baptize you with Water,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">One <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> is no Part nor Effect of the other.</NOTE> <HI>and he that cometh after shall produce the effects of this my Baptism in you by the Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. or <HI>he shall accomplish this Baptism in you</HI>; but, <HI>He shall baptize you.</HI> So then, if we understand the word truly and properly, when he saith, <HI>I baptize you</HI>; as consenting, that thereby is really signified, that he did baptize with the Baptism of Water; we must needs, unless we offer violence to the Text, understand the other part of the Sentence the same way; that where he adds presently, <HI>But he shall baptize you,</HI> &amp;c. that he understood it of their be∣ing truly to be baptized with another Baptism, than what he did baptize with: Else it had been non sense for him thus to have contra distinguished them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="II"/> <HI>Secondly</HI>; This is further confirmed by the Say∣ing of Christ himself, <HI>Acts</HI> 1.4, 5. <HI>But wait for the
<PB N="417" REF="003129_0215_0FF005E644CFF2E8"/>
Promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me: For</HI> John <HI>truly baptized with</HI> Water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Who were baptized by <HI>John,</HI> were still to wait for <HI>Christ's Baptism</HI> with the Spirit.</NOTE> <HI>but ye shall be baptised with the</HI> Holy Ghost <HI>not many days hence.</HI> There can scarce two places of Scripture run more parrallel, than this doth with the former, a little before mentioned; and therefore concludeth the same way, as did the other. For Christ here grants fully that <HI>John</HI> compleated his Baptism, as to the matter and substance of it: <HI>John</HI> (saith he) <HI>truly baptized with Water</HI>; which is as much as if he had said, <HI>John</HI> did truly and fully, administer the Baptism of Water, <HI>But ye shall be baptized with,</HI> &amp;c. This sheweth that they were to be baptized with some other Baptism than the Baptism of Water; and that altho' they were formerly baptized with the Baptism of Water, yet not with that of Christ, which they were to be baptized with.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="III"/> <HI>Thirdly; Peter</HI> observes the same distinction, <HI>Acts</HI> 11.16. <HI>Then remembred I the Word of the Lord, how that he said,</HI> John <HI>indeed baptized with</HI> Water;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> with the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and that with <HI>Water</HI> differ.</NOTE> <HI>but ye shall be baptized with the</HI> Holy Ghost. The Apo∣stle makes this application upon the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI>'s falling upon them; whence he infers, that they were then baptized with the Baptism of the Spirit. As to what is urged from his calling afterwards for <HI>Water,</HI> it shall be spoken to hereafter. From all which <HI>Three Sentences</HI> relative one to another, <HI>first</HI> of <HI>John, secondly</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>thirdly</HI> of <HI>Peter,</HI> it doth evidently follow, that such as were truly and really baptized with the Baptism of Water, were notwithstanding not baptized with the Baptism of the Spirit, which is that of Christ; and such as truly and really did, administer the Baptism of Wa∣ter, did, in so doing, not administer the Baptism of Christ. So that if there be now but One Bap∣tism, as we have already proved, we may safely conclude, that it is that of the Spirit, and not of Water; else it would follow, that the One Baptism, which now continues, were the Baptism of Water,
<PB N="418" REF="003129_0216_0FF005E7E0AC8468"/>
i. e. <HI>John</HI>'s Baptism, and not the <HI>Baptism of the Spi∣rit,</HI> i. e. <HI>Christ</HI>'s, which were most absurd.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If it be said further, <HI>That tho' the Baptism of</HI> John, <HI>before</HI> Christ<HI>'s was administred, was different from it, as being the Figure only; yet new, that both it, as the Figure, and that of the Spirit as the Substance, is ne∣cessary to make up the One Baptism.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; This urgeth nothing, unless it be granted also, that both of them belong to the Es∣sence of <HI>Baptism</HI>; so that <HI>Baptism</HI> is not to be ac∣counted as truly administred, where both are not; which none of our Adversaries will acknowledge: But on the contrary,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water Bap∣tism is not the true <HI>Baptism of Christ.</HI></NOTE> account not only all those truly baptized with the <HI>Baptism of Christ,</HI> who are baptized with <HI>Water,</HI> tho' they be uncertain, whe∣ther they be baptized with the <HI>Spirit</HI> or not; but they even account such truly baptized with the <HI>Baptism</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> because <HI>sprinkled,</HI> or baptized with Water, tho' it be manifest and most certain, that they are not baptized with the Spirit, as being Enemies thereunto in their Hearts by wicked Works. So here, by their own confession, <HI>Bap∣tism with Water</HI> is without the Spirit: Wherefore we may far safer conclude, that the <HI>Baptism of the Spirit,</HI> which is that of <HI>Christ,</HI> is and may be with∣out that of <HI>Water,</HI> as appears in that of <HI>Acts</HI> 11. where <HI>Peter</HI> testifies of these Men, that <HI>they were baptized with the Spirit</HI>; tho' not then <HI>baptized with Water.</HI> And indeed the Controversie in this, as in most other things, stands betwixt us and our Op∣posers, in that they not only often-times prefer the Form and Shadow, to the Power and Sub∣stance; by denominating Persons as Inheritors and Possessors of the thing, from their having the Form and Shadow, tho' really wanting the Power and Substance; and not admitting those to be so de∣nominated, who have the Power and Substance, if they want the Form and Shadow. This appears evidently, in that they account those truly <HI>baptized</HI>
<PB N="419" REF="003129_0216_0FF005E7E0AC8468"/>
with the <HI>One Baptism of Christ,</HI> who are not bap∣tized with the <HI>Spirit</HI> (which in Scripture is par∣ticularly called the <HI>Baptism of Christ</HI>) if they be only baptized with Water; which themselves yet confess to be but the Shadow or Figure.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bap∣tism of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Spirit needeth a sprinkling or dipping in Water.</NOTE> And moreover, in that they account not those who are surely baptized with the <HI>Baptism of the Spirit,</HI> bap∣tized; neither will they have them so denominated, unless they be also <HI>sprinkled</HI> with, or <HI>dipped</HI> in Wa∣ter. But we on the contrary, do always prefer the Power to the Form, the Substance to the Sha∣dow; and where the Substance and Power is, we doubt not to denominate the Person accordingly, tho' the Form be wanting. And therefore we al∣ways seek first, and plead for the Substance and Power, as knowing that to be indispensably ne∣cessary; tho' the Form sometimes may be dispensed with, and the Figure or Type may cease, when the Substance and Anti type come to be enjoyed; as it doth in this case, which shall hereafter be made appear.</P>
<P N="4"><MILESTONE UNIT="Proof" N="IV"/> §. IV. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> That the <HI>One Baptism of Christ,</HI> is not a washing with Water, appears from,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The plain∣est Defini∣tion of the Baptism of Christ in all the Bible.</NOTE> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.21. <HI>The like Figure whereunto even Baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the Flesh, but the answer of a good Conscience towards God) by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ</HI>: So plain a Defi∣nition of Baptism is not in all the Bible; and there∣fore, seeing it is so plain, it may well be preferred to all the coined Definitions of the School Men. The Apostle tells us, First, <HI>Negatively,</HI> what it is not, viz. <HI>Not a putting away of the filth of the Flesh</HI>; then surely it is not a <HI>washing</HI> with Water, since that is so. Secondly, he tells us <HI>Affirmatively,</HI> what it is, viz. <HI>The answer of a good Conscience towards God, by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ:</HI> Where he Affirma∣tively defines it to be <HI>the Answer</HI> (or <HI>Confession,</HI> as the <HI>Syriack</HI> Version hath it) <HI>of a good Conscience.</HI> Now this <HI>Answer</HI> cannot be, but where the Spirit
<PB N="420" REF="003129_0217_0FF005EAD64EE830"/>
of God hath purified the Soul, and the Fire of his Judgment hath burned up the Unrighteous Na∣ture: And those in whom this Work is wrought may be truly said to be <HI>baptized with the Baptism of Christ,</HI> i. e. <HI>of the</HI> Spirit <HI>end of</HI> Fire. Whatever way then we take this Definition of the Apostle, of Christ's Baptism, it confirmeth our Sentence: For if we take the First, or Negative part, viz. <HI>That it is not a putting away of the filth of the Flesh,</HI> then it will follow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Water Bap∣tism <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t out from the</HI> Bap∣tism of Christ.</NOTE> that Water-Baptism is not it, because that is a <HI>putting away of the filth of the Flesh.</HI> If we take the Second, and Affirmative Definition, to wit, <HI>That it is the Answer,</HI> or Confession, <HI>of a good Con∣science,</HI> &amp;c. then Water Baptism is not it: Since, as our Adversaries will not deny, Water-Baptism doth not always imply it, neither is it any necessary con∣sequence thereof. Moreover, the Apostle in this place doth seem especially to guard against those, that might esteem Water-Baptism the true Baptism of Christ; because (lest by the Comparison induced by him, in the preceding verse, betwixt the Souls that were saved in <HI>Noah</HI>'s Ark, and us that are now saved by Baptism; lest, I say, any should have thence hastily concluded, that because the for∣mer were saved by Water, this place must needs be taken to speak of Water-Baptism) to prevent such a mistake, he plainly affirms, that it is not that, but another thing. He saith not, that it is the <HI>Water,</HI> or <HI>the putting away of the filth of the Flesh, as accom∣panied with the answer of a good Conscience; whereof the one,</HI> viz. <HI>the Water, is the</HI> Sacramental Element, <HI>administred by the Minister; and the other, the</HI> Grace <HI>or Thing signified, conferred by Christ</HI>; but plainly, <HI>That it is not the putting away,</HI> &amp;c. than which there can be nothing more manifest to Men Unpreju∣dicate and Judicious. Moreover, <HI>Peter</HI> calls this here, which saves, the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the <HI>Antitype,</HI> or the <HI>thing figur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> whereas it is usually translated, as if <HI>the like Figure did now save us?</HI> thereby insinuating,

of God.</HI> It is to be observed here, that the Apostle speaks generally, without any <HI>Exclusive Term,</HI> but <HI>Comprehensive</HI> of all: He saith not, <HI>Some of you that were baptized into Christ, have put on Christ</HI>; but, <HI>As many of you</HI>: Which is as much as if he had said, <HI>Every one of you, that hath been baptized into Christ, hath put on Christ.</HI> Whereby it is evident, that this is not meant of Water Baptism, but of the Bap∣tism of the Spirit;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Which Ef∣fects <HI>Water Baptism</HI> wants.</NOTE> because else it would follow, that whosoever had been Baptized with Water-Baptism, had <HI>put on Christ,</HI> and were <HI>risen</HI> with him; which all acknowledge to be most Absurd.

<P>This hath had the more Weight with me, be∣cause I find not any standing Ordinance or Appoint∣ment of Christ necessary to Christians, for which we have not either Christs own Practice or Command, as to obey all the Commandments, which compre∣hend both our Duty towards God and Man, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and where the Gospel requires more than the Law; which is abundantly signified in the 5<HI>th</HI> and 6<HI>th</HI> Chapters of <HI>Matthew,</HI> and elsewhere.

<P N="2"><MILESTONE N="III"/> §. VI. But to make Water Baptism a necessary In∣stitution of the Christian Religion, which is Pure and Spiritual,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Gospel</HI> puts an end to <HI>Carnal Ordi∣nances.</HI></NOTE> and not Carnal and Ceremonial, is to de∣rogate from the <HI>New Covenant-Dispensation,</HI> and set up the <HI>Legal Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> of which this of Baptism, or Washing with Water, was one; as appears
<PB N="425" REF="003129_0219_0FF005EE484F3A50"/>
from <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.10. where the Apostle speaking there∣of, saith, that it stood <HI>only in Meats and Drinks, and divers Baptisms, and carnal Ordinances, imposed un∣til the time of Reformation:</HI> If then the time of Re∣formation, or the Dispensation of the Gospel, which puts an end to the Shadows, become, then such Baptisms and carnal Ordinances are no more to be imposed. For how Baptism with Water comes now to be a Spiritual Ordinance, more than before in the time of the <HI>Law,</HI> doth not appear; seeing it is but <HI>Water</HI> still, and a Washing of the outward Man, and a putting away of the Filth of the Flesh still: And as before, those that were so washed, were not thereby made perfect, as pertaining to the <HI>Con∣science,</HI> neither are they at this Day; as our Ad∣versaries must needs acknowledge, and Experience abundantly sheweth. So that the matter of it, which is a Washing with Water, and the effects of it, which is only an outward Cleansing, being still the same, how comes Water Baptism to be less a Carnal Ordinance now, than before?</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="1"/> If it be said, That <HI>God confers</HI> inward Grace <HI>upon some, that are now Baptized.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> So no doubt he did also upon some that used those Baptisms among the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="2"/> Or if it be said; <HI>Because 'tis commanded by Christ now, under the New Covenant.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer, <HI>First,</HI> That's to beg the Question; of which hereafter.</P>
<P>But <HI>Secondly,</HI> We find, That where the matter of Ordinances is the same, and the End the same, they are never accounted more or less Spiritual, because of their different times. Now, was not God the Author of the Purifications and Baptisms un∣der the Law? Was not Water the matter of them, which is so now? Was not the End of them to signifie an Inward Purifying by an Outward Wash∣ing? And is not that alledged to be the End still? And are the necessary Effects or Consequences of it
<PB N="426" REF="003129_0220_0FF005F33A832428"/>
any better now than before, since Men are now by the virtue of Water-Baptism,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men are no more <HI>now</HI> than <HI>before</HI> by <HI>Water-Baptism</HI> inwardly cleansed.</NOTE> as a necessary consequence of it, no more than before, made in∣wardly clean? And if some by God's Grace, that are baptized with Water, are inwardly purified, so were some also under the Law; so that this is not any necessary consequence or effect, neither of this, nor that Baptism. It is then plainly Re∣pugnant to right Reason, as well as to the Scrip∣ture Testimony, to affirm <HI>that</HI> to be a Spiritual Or∣dinance now, which was a Carnal Ordinance before, if it be still the same, both as to its Author, Mat∣ter and End, however made to vary in some small Circumstances. The Spirituality of the <HI>New Cove∣nant,</HI> and of its <HI>Worship</HI> established by Christ, con∣sisted not in such superficial Alterations of Cir∣cumstances; but after another manner. Therefore let our Adversaries shew us, if they can, (without begging the Question, and building upon some one or other of their own Principles, denied by us) where ever Christ appointed or ordained any In∣stitution or Observation under the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> as belonging to the Nature of it, or such a neces∣sary part of its <HI>Worship</HI> as is perpetually to conti∣nue, which being one in Substance and Effects, (I speak of Necessary, not Accidental Effects) yet be∣cause of some small difference in Form or Circum∣stance, was before Carnal, notwithstanding it was commanded by God under the <HI>Law,</HI> but now is become Spiritual, because commanded by Christ under the <HI>Gospel</HI>? And if they cannot do this, then if Water-Baptism was once a Carnal Ordinance, as the Apostle positively affirms it to have been, it remains a Carnal Ordinance still; and if a Carnal Ordinance, then no necessary part of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> or <HI>New Covenant Dispensation</HI>; and if no necessary part of it, then not needful to continue, nor to be practis∣ed by such as live and walk under this <HI>Dispen∣sation.</HI> But in this, as in most other things, ac∣cording

as we have often observed) our Adversa∣ries <HI>Judaize,</HI> and renouncing the <HI>Glorious</HI> and <HI>Spiri∣tual Priviledges</HI> of the New Covenant, are sticking in, and cleaving to, the Rudiments of the Old, both in <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> as being more suited and agreeable to their Carnal Apprehensions, and Na∣tural Senses. But we, on the contrary, travel above all, to lay hold upon, and cleave unto the <HI>Light</HI> of the <HI>Glorious Gospel,</HI> revealed unto us. And the Harmony of the Truth we profess in this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Law</HI> distin∣guished from the <HI>Gospel.</HI></NOTE> may appear, by briefly observing how in all things we follow the <HI>Spiritual Gospel of Christ,</HI> as contra∣distinguished from the Carnality of the <HI>Legal Dispensation</HI>; while our Adversaries, through re∣jecting this <HI>Gospel,</HI> are still labouring under the Burthen of the <HI>Law,</HI> which neither they, nor their Fathers, were able to bear.</P>
<P><HI>For the Law and Rule of the</HI> Old Covenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Out∣ward <HI>Bap∣tism, Wor∣ship, Law,</HI> distin∣guished from the Inward.</NOTE> <HI>and</HI> Jews, <HI>was outward, written in Tables of Stone and Parchments:</HI> So also is that of our Adversaries. <HI>But the Law of the</HI> New Covenant <HI>is inward and per∣petual, written in the Heart:</HI> So is ours.</P>
<P><HI>The Worship of the</HI> Jews <HI>was outward and carnal, limited to set times, places and persons, and performed according to set prescribed Forms and Observations:</HI> So is that of our Adversaries. <HI>But the Worship of the</HI> New Covenant <HI>is neither limited to time, place, nor person; but is performed in the</HI> Spirit <HI>and in</HI> Truth, <HI>and is not acted according to set Forms and Prescriptions, but as the</HI> Spirit of God <HI>immediately acts, moves and leads, whether it be to Preach, Pray, or Sing:</HI> And such is also our Worship.</P>
<P><HI>So likewise the Baptism among the</HI> Jews <HI>under the Law, was an outward Washing with outward Water, only to typifie an inward</HI> Purification of the Soul, <HI>which did not necessarily follow upon those that were thus bap∣tized:</HI> But the Baptism of Christ under the Gos∣pel, is the Baptism of the Spirit, and of Fire; <HI>not the putting away of the filth of the Flesh, but the answer

<P N="7"><MILESTONE UNIT="Arg."/> §. VII. But again, If Water Baptism had been an Ordinance of the Gospel, then the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> would have been sent to administer it; but he de∣clares positively, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.17. <HI>That Christ sent him not to Baptize, but to Preach the Gospel:</HI> The Rea∣son <MILESTONE N="IV"/> of that Consequence is undeniable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That <HI>Wa∣ter-Baptism</HI> is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adge of <HI>Christi∣ans,</HI> like <HI>Circumci∣sion</HI> of the <HI>Jews.</HI></NOTE> because the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI>'s Commission was as large as that of any of them; and consequently, he being in special manner the Apostle of Christ to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> if Water-Baptism (as our Adversaries contend) be to be accounted the <HI>Badge</HI> of Christianity, he had more need than any of the rest to be sent to Baptize with Water, that he might mark the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> Con∣verted by him, with that Christian Sign. But in∣deed the Reason holds better thus, That since <HI>Paul</HI> was the Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and that in his Ministry he doth through all (as by his <HI>Epistles</HI> appears) labour to wean them from the former <HI>Jewish Ceremonies</HI> and <HI>Observations,</HI> (tho' in so doing he was sometimes undeservedly judged by others of his Brethren, who were unwilling to lay aside those Ceremonies) therefore his Commission (tho' as full, as to the preaching of the Gospel, and New Cove∣nant Dispensation, as that of the other Apostles) did not require of him, that he should lead those Converts into such <HI>Jewish Observations</HI> and <HI>Baptisms,</HI> however that Practise was indulged in, and pract∣ised by the other Apostles, among their <HI>Jewish Proselytes:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cor. 1.14.</NOTE> For which cause <HI>he thanks God that he had baptized so few</HI>; intimating, that what he did therein,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t sent to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aptize.</HI></NOTE> he did not by virtue of his Apostolick Commission, but rather in Condesension to their Weakness; even as at another time he Circumcised <HI>Timothy.</HI></P>

But as to Water Baptism, for that it was no standing Ordinance of Christ, but only practised as in Condesension to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and by some Apostles to some <HI>Gentiles</HI> also; there∣fore so soon as the Apostle perceived the abuse of it, he let the <HI>Corinthians</HI> understand, how little stress was to be laid upon it, by shewing them, that he was glad, that he had administred this Ceremony to so few of them; and by telling them plainly, that it was no part of his Commission, neither that which he was sent to administer.</P>

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Allegat." N="1"/> But First, they alledge, <HI>That Christ's Baptism, tho' a Baptism with Water, did differ from</HI> John<HI>'s, because</HI> John <HI>only Baptized with Water unto Re∣pentance, but Christ commands his Disciples to Baptize in the Name of the</HI> Father, Son, <HI>and</HI> Holy Ghost; <HI>reckoning, that in this form, there lieth a great dif∣ference betwixt the Baptism of</HI> John, <HI>and that of Christ.</HI></P>
<PB N="433" REF="003129_0223_0FF005FA4BDAD5F8"/>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I Answer, In that <HI>John</HI>'s Baptism was unto Re∣pentance, the difference lieth not there, because so is Christ's also: Yea, our advesaries will not deny, but that <HI>adult Persons,</HI> that are to be baptized, ought ere they are admitted to Water Baptism, to Repent and Confess their Sins; and that <HI>Infants</HI> also, with a respect to, and consideration of their Baptism, ought to Repent and Confess: So that the difference lieth not here; since this of Repentance and Confession agrees as well to Christ's as to <HI>John</HI>'s Baptism. But in this our Adversaries are divided; for <HI>Calvin</HI> will have Christ's and <HI>John</HI>'s to be all one, <HI>Inst. lib.</HI> 4. chap. 15. Sect. 7, 8. Yet they do differ, and the difference is, in that the one is by Water, the other not, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As to what Christ saith, in command∣ing them to <HI>baptize in the Name of the Father, Son, and Spirit,</HI> I confess that states the difference, and it is great; but that lies not only in admitting Water-Baptism in this different Form, by a bare ex∣pressing of these Words: For as the Text saith no such thing, neither do I see, how it can be infer∣red from it. For the <HI>Greek</HI> is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the <HI>Name of the Lord,</HI> how taken in Scrip∣ture.</NOTE> <HI>into the Name</HI>; now the <HI>Name</HI> of the <HI>Lord</HI> is often taken in Scripture for something else, than a bare sound of Words, or literal expression, even for his <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Power</HI>; as may appear from <HI>Psalm</HI> 54.3. <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.3. <HI>Prov.</HI> 18.10. and in many more. Now that the Apostles were, by their Ministry, to bap∣tize the Nations <HI>into this Name, Virtue</HI> and <HI>Power</HI>; and that they did so, is evident by these Testi∣monies of <HI>Paul,</HI> above-mentioned, where he saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bap∣tism <HI>into the Name,</HI> what it is?</NOTE> <HI>That as many of them as were baptized into Christ, have put on Christ:</HI> This must have been a <HI>baptizing into the Name,</HI> i. e. <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI>; and not a meer formal Expression of Words, adjoined with Water-Baptism; because, as hath been above observed, it doth not follow as a natural or necessary conse∣quence of it. I would have those, who desire to have their Faith built upon no other Foundation,

than the Testimony of God's Spirit and Scriptures of Truth, throughly to consider, whether there can be any thing further alledged for this Intepretation, than what prejudice of Education, and influence of Tradition, hath imposed. Perhaps it may stum∣ble the unwary and inconsiderate Reader, as if the very Character of Christianity were abolished, to tell him plainly, that this Scripture is not to be un∣derstood of Baptizing with Water; and that this Form of <HI>Baptizing in the Name of the Father, Son, and Spirit,</HI> hath no warrant from <HI>Mat.</HI> 28, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether Christ did prescribe a Form of Baptism, in <HI>Mat. 28?</HI></NOTE>For which, besides the Reason taken from the Signification of (<HI>the Name</HI>) as being the <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> above expressed, let it be considered, that if it had been a <HI>Form</HI> prescribed by Christ to his Apostles, then surely they would have made use of that Form in the administring of Water-Baptism, to such as they baptized with Water; but though particular mention be made in divers places of the <HI>Acts,</HI> who were baptized, and how; and tho' it be particularly expressed, that they <HI>baptized</HI> such and such, as <HI>Acts</HI> 2.41. &amp; 8.12, 13, 38. &amp; 9.18. &amp; 10.48. &amp; 16, 15. &amp; 18.8. yet there is not a word of this Form. And in two places, <HI>Acts</HI> 8.16. &amp; 19.5. it is said of some, that they were <HI>baptized in the Name of the Lord Jesus</HI>; by which it yet more appears, that either the Author of this <HI>History</HI> hath been very defective, who having so often occasion to mention this, yet omitteth so substantial a part of Baptism, (which were to accuse the Holy Ghost, by whose guidance <HI>Luke</HI> wrote it) or else, that the Apostles did no ways understand, that Christ by his Commission, <HI>Mat</HI> 28. did enjoyn them such a Form of Water Bapt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sm, seeing they did not use it. And therefore it is safer to conclude, that what they did in administring Water Baptism, they did not by Vertue of that Commission; else they would have used it: For our Adversaries, I sup∣pose, would judge it a great Heresie to administer
<PB N="435" REF="003129_0224_0FF005FBEE322048"/>
Water Baptism without that, or only in the <HI>Name of Jesus,</HI> without mention of <HI>Father</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> as it is ex∣presly said they did, in the two places above cited.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Alleg." N="2"/> <HI>Secondly</HI>; They say, <HI>If this were not understood of</HI> Water Baptism, <HI>it would be a Tautology, and all one with</HI> Teaching.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I say, <HI>Nay: Baptizing with the Spirit</HI> is somewhat farther than Teaching, or informing the Under∣standing; for it imports a <HI>reaching to,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Teach∣ing &amp; Bap∣tizing differ.</NOTE> and <HI>melting the Heart,</HI> whereby it is <HI>turned,</HI> as well as the <HI>Un∣derstanding informed.</HI> Besides, we find often in the Scripture, that <HI>Teaching</HI> and <HI>Instructing</HI> are put toge∣ther, without any Absurdity, or needless Tautology, and yet these two have a greater Affinity, than <HI>Teaching</HI> and <HI>Baptizing</HI> with the Spirit.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Alleg." N="3"/> <HI>Thirdly</HI>; They say, <HI>Baptism in this place must be understood with Water, because it is the</HI> Action of the Apostles; <HI>&amp; so cannot be the</HI> Baptism of the Spirit, <HI>which is the Work of Christ, and his Grace, not of Man,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; <HI>Baptism with the Spirit,</HI> tho' not wrought without Christ and his Grace, is instrumentally done by Men fitted of God for that purpose;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bap∣tism with the Spirit ascribed to godly Men as Instru∣ments.</NOTE> and there∣fore no absurdity follows, that Baptism with the Spirit should be expressed as the Action of the Apo¦stles: For though it be Christ, by his Grace, that gives Spiritual Gifts, yet the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.11. speaks of his <HI>imparting to them Spiritual Gifts</HI>; and he tells the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> that he had <HI>begotten them through the Gospel,</HI> 1 Cor. 4.15. And yet to beget People to the Faith, is the Work of Christ and his Grace, not of Men. To <HI>Convert the Heart,</HI> is pro∣perly the Work of Christ; and yet the Scripture often-times ascribes it to Men, as being the In∣struments: And since <HI>Paul</HI>'s Commission was, <HI>To turn People from Darkness, to Light,</HI> tho' that be not done without Christ co-operating by his Grace; so may also Baptizing with the Spirit be expressed, as performable by Man, as the Instrument, tho' the Work of Christ's Grace be needful to concur there∣unto:
<PB N="436" REF="003129_0225_0FF005FE819BC228"/>
So that it is no absurdity to say, that the Apostles did administer the Baptism of the Spirit.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Alleg." N="4"/> <HI>Lastly</HI>; They say, <HI>That since Christ saith here, that he will be with his Disciples to the end of the world, there∣fore</HI> Water Baptism <HI>must continue so long.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> If he had been speaking here of Water-Baptism, then that might have been urged; but seeing that is denied, and proved to be false, nothing from thence can be gathered: He speaking of the Bap∣tism of the Spirit, which we freely confess doth re∣main to the end of the World; yea, so long as Christ's Presence abideth with his Children.</P>
<P N="9"><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="3"/> §. IX. <HI>Thirdly</HI>; They object <HI>the</HI> constant Practice <HI>of the Apostles in the Primitive Church, who,</HI> they say, <HI>did always administer</HI> Water Baptism <HI>to such as they Converted to the Faith of Christ: And hence also they further urge that of</HI> Mat. 28. <HI>to have been meant of</HI> Water, <HI>or else the Apostles did not understand it, in that in</HI> baptizing <HI>they used</HI> Water; <HI>or that in so doing they walked without a Commission.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; That it was the <HI>Constant Practise of the Apostles,</HI> is denied; for we have shewn in the Ex∣ample of <HI>Paul,</HI> that it was not so; since it were most absurd to judge, that he Converted only those few, even of the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> whom he saith he <HI>baptized</HI>; nor were it less absurd to think, that that was a <HI>constant</HI> Apostolick Practice, which he, that was not inferiour to the chiefest of the Apostles, and who declares, he laboured as much as they all, rejoiceth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Apostles</HI> baptized.</NOTE> he was so little in. But further, the Con∣clusion inferred from the Apostles Practice of Bap∣tizing with Water, to evince that they understood <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. of Water-Baptism, doth not hold: For tho' they baptized with Water, it will not follow, that either they did it by Vertue of that Commission, or that they mistook that place; nor can there be any <HI>Medium</HI> brought, that will infer such a Con∣clusion. As to the other insinuated Absurdity, <HI>That they did it without a Commission</HI>; it is none at
<PB N="437" REF="003129_0225_0FF005FE819BC228"/>
all: For they might have done it by a Permission, as being in use before Christ's Death; and because the People, nursed up with outward Ceremonies, could not be weaned wholly from them. And thus they used other things, as Circumcision, and Legal Purifications, which yet they had no Com∣mission from Christ to do, (to which we shall speak more at length in the following <HI>Proposition,</HI> con∣cerning the <HI>Supper.</HI>)</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> But if from the <HI>sameness</HI> of the Word, because Christ bids them <HI>Baptize,</HI> and they afterwards in the use of Water are said to <HI>Baptize,</HI> it be judged probable, <HI>that they did understand that Commission,</HI> Mat. 28. <HI>to authorize them to Baptize with</HI> Water, <HI>and accordingly practised it.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> Altho' it should be granted, that for a season they did so far mistake it, as to judge, that Water belonged to that Baptism, (which however I find no necessity of granting) yet I see not any great Absurdity would thence follow. For it is plain, they did mistake that Commission, as to a main part of it, for a season, as where he bids them <HI>Go teach all Nations</HI>; since some time after, they judged it unlawful to teach the <HI>Gentiles</HI>; yea, <HI>Peter</HI> himself scrupled it, until by a Vision constrained thereunto; for which after he had done it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Apos∣tles did <HI>scruple</HI> the teaching the <HI>Gen∣tiles.</HI></NOTE> he was for a season (until they were better inform∣ed) judged by the rest of his Brethren. Now, if the Education of the <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> and their Propensity to adhere and stick to the <HI>Jewish Reli∣gion,</HI> did so far influence them, that even after Christ's Resurrection, and the <HI>pouring forth</HI> of the Spi∣rit, they could not receive nor admit of the Teach∣ing of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> tho' Christ, in his Commission to them, commanded them to preach to them; what further Absurdity were it to suppose, that through the like Mistake, the chiefest of them having been the Disciples of <HI>John,</HI> and his Baptism being so much prized there among the <HI>Jews,</HI> that they also took
<PB N="438" REF="003129_0226_0FF0060059B6C768"/>
Christ's Baptism, intended by him of the Spirit, to be that of Water, which was <HI>John</HI>'s, and accord∣ingly practised it for a season? It suffices us, that if they were so mistaken, (tho' I say not that they were so) they did not always remain under that Mistake: Else <HI>Peter</HI> would not have said of the Baptism, which now saves, <HI>that it is not a putting away of the filth of the Flesh,</HI> which certainly Water-Baptism is.</P>
<P>But further, They urge much <HI>Peter's</HI> baptizing <HI>Cornelius</HI>; in which they press two things, First, <HI>That Water-Baptism is used, even to those that had re∣ceived the Spirit.</HI> Secondly, <HI>That it is said positively, he commanded them to be baptized,</HI> Acts 10.47, 48.</P>
<P>But neither of these doth necessarily infer Water-Baptism to belong to the New Covenant-Dispensa∣tion, nor yet to be a perpetual standing Ordinance in the Church. For <HI>first,</HI> all that this will amount to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether <HI>Peter</HI>'s Baptizing some with Water makes it a standing Ordinance to the <HI>Church?</HI></NOTE> was, that <HI>Peter</HI> at that time baptized these Men; but that he did it by vertue of that Com∣mission, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. remains yet to be proved. And how doth the baptizing with Water, after the re∣ceiving of the Holy Ghost, prove the case, more than the use of Circumcision, and other Legal Rites, acknowledged to have been acted by him after∣wards? Also, no wonder if <HI>Peter,</HI> that thought it so strange (notwithstanding all that had been pro∣fessed before, and spoken by Christ) that the <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> should be made Partakers of the Gospel, and with great difficulty, not without an extraordinary Impluse thereunto, was brought to come to them, and eat with them, was apt to put this Ceremony upon them; which being, as it were, the particular Dispensation of <HI>John,</HI> the <HI>Fore-runner of Christ,</HI> seem∣ed to have greater Affinity with the Gospel, than the other <HI>Jewish Ceremonies,</HI> then used by the Church; but that will no ways infer our Adversaries Con∣clusion. <HI>Secondly,</HI> as to these words, <HI>And he com∣manded them to be baptized</HI>; it declareth matter of
<PB N="439" REF="003129_0226_0FF0060059B6C768"/>
<HI>Fact,</HI> not of <HI>Right,</HI> and amounteth to no more than, that <HI>Peter</HI> did at that time, <HI>pro hic &amp; nunc,</HI> command those Persons to be baptized with Water, which is not denied: But it saith nothing, that <HI>Peter</HI> com∣manded Water Baptism to be a standing and per∣petual Ordinance to the Church; neither can any Man of sound Reason say, if he heed what he says, that a Command in <HI>matter of Fact</HI> to particular Persons, loth infer the <HI>Thing commanded</HI> to be of general Obligation to all, if it be not otherwise bottomed upon some Positive Precept. Why doth <HI>Peter</HI>'s commanding <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his Houshold to be baptized at that time, infer Water-Baptism to continue, more than his Constraining (which is more than commanding) the <HI>Gentiles</HI> in general to be circumcised, and observe the Law? We find at that time, when <HI>Peter</HI> baptized <HI>Cornelius,</HI> it was not yet determined whether the Gentiles should not be Circumcised; but on the contrary, it was the most general sense of the Church, that <HI>they should</HI>: And therefore no wonder, if they thought it need∣ful at that time, that they should be baptized, which had more Affinity with the Gospel, and was a Bur∣then less grievous.</P>
<P N="10"><MILESTONE UNIT="Obj." N="4"/> §. X. <HI>Fourthly</HI>; They object <HI>from the signification of the word</HI> (Baptize) <HI>which is as much as to</HI> dip <HI>and</HI> wash <HI>with</HI> Water; <HI>alledging thence that the very Word imports a being</HI> baptized <HI>with</HI> Water.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> This Objection is very weak. For since Bap∣tizing with Water was a Rite among the <HI>Jews,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Baptizing</HI> signifies dipping, or washing with Water</NOTE> as <HI>Paulus Riccius</HI> sheweth, even before the Coming of <HI>John</HI>; and that the Ceremony received that Name from the Nature of the Practice, as used both by the Jews, and by <HI>John.</HI> Yea, we find that Christ and his <HI>Apostles</HI> frequently make use of these Terms to a more Spiritual Signification: Circumcision was only used and understood among the Jews to be <HI>that of the Flesh</HI>; but the Apostle tells us of the <HI>Circumci∣sion of the Heart and Spirit, made without hands.</HI> So
<PB N="440" REF="003129_0227_0FF00603473EC838"/>
that tho Baptism was used among the Jews, only to signifie a <HI>washing with Water,</HI> yet both <HI>John,</HI> Christ, and his Apostles, speak of a being <HI>Baptized with the Spirit, and with Fire</HI>; which they make the peculiar Baptism of Christ, as contra-distinguished from that of Water, which was <HI>John</HI>'s, (as is above shewn.) So that tho' Baptism among the <HI>Jews,</HI> was only understood of Water; yet among Christians it is very well understood of the Spirit, without Wa∣ter: As we see Christ and his Apostles spiritually to understand things, under the terms of what had been Shadows before. Thus Christ speaking of his <HI>Body</HI> (tho' the <HI>Jews</HI> mistook him) said, <HI>He would destroy the Temple, and build it again in three days</HI>; and many more that might be instanced. But if the Etymology of the word should be tenaciously adhered to, it would militate against most of our Adversaries, as well as against us: For the <HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> signifies <HI>immergo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> immergo, intirgo, <HI>to</HI> plunge, <HI>and</HI> dip in.</NOTE> that is, to <HI>plunge,</HI> and <HI>dip in</HI>; and that was the proper use of Water-Baptism among the Jews, and also by <HI>John</HI> and the Primi∣tive Christians, who used it: Whereas our Adversa∣ries, for the most part, only <HI>sprinkle</HI> a little Water <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Forehead,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of old used <HI>Water-Baptism,</HI> were <HI>dipp'd</HI> and <HI>plung'd;</HI> and those that were only <HI>sprin∣kled,</HI> were not admit∣ted to any Office in the Church, and why?</NOTE> which doth not at all answer to the word (<HI>Baptism.</HI>) Yea, those of old among Christians, that used Water-Baptism, thought this <HI>dipping</HI> or <HI>plunging</HI> so needful, that they thus <HI>dipped Children</HI>: And forasmuch as it was judged, that it might prove hurtful to some weak Constitutions, <HI>Sprinkling,</HI> to prevent that hurt, was introduced; yet then it was likewise appointed, that such as were only <HI>sprinkled,</HI> and not <HI>dipped,</HI> should not be admitted to have any Office in the Church, as not being sufficiently <HI>baptized.</HI> So that if our Adver∣saries will stick to the word, they must alter their method of <HI>sprinkling.</HI></P>

For the Mystery of Iniquity, which began to work in the Apostles days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heathen∣ish Cere∣monies <HI>introduced into the</HI> Christian Worship.</NOTE> soon spoiled the Simplicity and Pu∣rity of the Christian Worship, so that not only many <HI>Jewish Rites</HI> were retained, but many <HI>Heathenish Customs</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies</HI> introduced in the Christian Worship; as particularly the word (<HI>Sacrament.</HI>)

So that it is great Folly, especially for Protestants, to plead any thing of this from <HI>Tradition</HI> or <HI>Antiquity</HI>; for we find, that neither Papists nor Protestants use the Rites exactly, as the Ancients did, who in such things, not walking by the most certain Rule of God's Spirit, but doting too much upon outwards, were very uncertain. For most of them all, in the Primitive Time, did wholly <HI>plunge</HI> and <HI>dip</HI> those they baptized, which neither Papists, nor most Protestants do: Yea, several of the <HI>Fathers</HI> ac∣cused some as <HI>Hereticks,</HI> in their days, for holding some Principles, common with Protestants, concern∣ing it; as particularly <HI>Augustin</HI> doth the <HI>Pelagians,</HI> for saying, that <HI>Infants dying unbaptized, may be saved.</HI> And the <HI>Manichees</HI> were condemned, for denying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exercism <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Adjurae∣tion.</NOTE> that <HI>Grace is universally given by Baptism</HI>; and <HI>Julian</HI> the <HI>Pelagian,</HI> by <HI>Augustin,</HI> for denying <HI>Exorcism and Ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fflation in the use of Baptism:</HI> All which things Protestants deny also.

<P>Now, for their calling them <HI>Hereticks</HI> and <HI>Ma∣nichees,</HI> we have nothing but the Testimony of their Accusers, which will no more invalidate their Te∣stimony for this Truth, against the Use of Water-<HI>Baptism,</HI> or give more ground to Charge us, as being one with the <HI>Manichees,</HI> than because some, called by them <HI>Manichees,</HI> do agree with <HI>Protestants</HI> in some things, that therefore <HI>Protestants</HI> are <HI>Manichees,</HI> or <HI>Hereticks,</HI> which <HI>Protestants</HI> can no ways shun.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bap∣tism of Infants</HI> an Humane Tradition.</NOTE>As for the latter part of the <HI>Thesis,</HI> denying the Use of <HI>Infant-Baptism,</HI> it necessarily follows, from what is above said.

of a Spiritual Body, and not of that Body, or Temple of Jesus Christ, which was born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and in which he walked, lived and suffered in the Land of <HI>Judea</HI>; because that it is said that it <HI>came down from Heaven,</HI> yea, that it is He that <HI>came down from Heaven.</HI> Now all Chri∣stians at present generally acknowledge, that that outward Body of Christ came not down from Hea∣ven; neither was it that part of Christ which came down from Heaven. And to put the matter out of doubt, when the carnal <HI>Jews</HI> would have been so understanding it, he tells them plainly, vers. 63. <HI>It is the</HI> Spirit <HI>that quickeneth, but the</HI> Flesh <HI>profiteth nothing.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Solid Rea∣sons, that it is his Spi∣ritual Body, Christ speaks of.</NOTE> This is also founded upon most sound and solid Reason; because that it is the Soul, not the Body, that is to be nourished by this Flesh and Blood. Now outward Flesh cannot nourish not feed the Soul; there is no Proportion, nor Analogy betwixt them; neither is the Communion of the Saints with God, by a Conjunction, and mu∣tual Participation of Flesh, but of the Spirit: <HI>He that is joyned to the Lord,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor 6.17</NOTE> <HI>is One Spirit,</HI> not <HI>One Flesh.</HI> For the Flesh Im an outward Flesh, even such as was that, wherein Christ lived and walked, when upon Earth; and not Flesh when transported by a <HI>Metaphor,</HI> to be understood Spiritually) can only partake of Flesh, as Spirit of Spirit: As the Body cannot feed upon Spirit, neither can the Spirit feed upon Flesh. And that the Flesh here spoken of, is Spiritually understood, appears further, in that, that which feedeth upon it shall never dye: But the Bodies of all Men once dye; yea, it behoved the Body of Christ himself to dye: That this Bo∣dy, and Spiritual Flesh and Blood of Christ, is to be understood of that Divine and Heavenly Seed, before spoken of by us, appears both by the Na∣ture and Fruits of it. <HI>First,</HI> its said, <HI>It is that which cometh down from Heaven, and giveth Life unto the World:</HI> Now this answers to that Light and Seed
<PB N="449" REF="003129_0231_0FF0060DC51E2E40"/>
which is testified of, <HI>John</HI> 1. to be the <HI>Light of the World, and the Life of Men.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This Spiri∣tual Light and Seed, is as <HI>Bread</HI> to the hungry Soul.</NOTE> For that Spiritual Light and Seed, as it receives place in Men's Hearts, and room to spring up there, is as Bread to the hun∣gry and fainting Soul, that is (as it were) buried and dead in the Lusts of the World; which receives Life again, and revives, as it tasteth and partaketh of this Heavenly Bread: And they that partake of it, are said to come to Christ; neither can any have it, but by coming to him, and believing in the Ap∣pearance of his Light in their Hearts; by receiving which, and believing in it, the Participation of this Body and Bread is known. And that Christ understands the same thing here, by his Body, Flesh and Blood, which is understood, <HI>John</HI> 1. by the <HI>Light inlightning every Man,</HI> and the <HI>Life,</HI> &amp;c. ap∣pears; for the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Life,</HI> spoken of <HI>John</HI> 1. is said to be <HI>Christ; He is the true Light:</HI> And the <HI>Bread and Flesh,</HI> &amp;c. spoken of in <HI>John</HI> 6. is called <HI>Christ; I am the Bread of Life,</HI> saith he. Again, <HI>They that received that Light and Life,</HI> John 1.12. <HI>obtained Power to become the Sons of God, by believing in his Name:</HI> So also here, <HI>John</HI> 6.35. <HI>He that com∣eth unto this Bread of Life, shall not hunger; and he that believes in him, who is the Bread, shall never thirst.</HI> So then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ's Out∣ward and Spiritual Body di∣stinguished</NOTE> as there was the outward visible Body and Temple of Jesus Christ, which took its origin from the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>; so there is also the Spiritual Bo∣dy of Christ, by and through which, He, that was the <HI>Word in the beginning with God,</HI> and was and is GOD, did Reveal himself to the Sons of Men in all Ages, and whereby Men in all Ages come to be made Partakers of Eternal Life, and to have Communion and Fellowship with God and Christ.

And as the outward Birth cannot subsist, without some outward Body to feed upon, some outward Flesh, and some outward Drink; so neither can this inward Birth, without it be fed by this inward Flesh and Blood of Christ, which an∣swers to it after the same manner, by way of Ana∣logy.

<P N="4">§. IV.

And tho' they, for the most part, agree generally in this, yet how do they contend and de∣bate one against another? How strangely are they pinched, pained and straitned, to make this Spiri∣tual Mystery agree to that Ceremony? And what monstrous and wild Opinions and Conceivings have they invented, to enclose or affix the Body of Christ to their Bread and Wine? From which Opinion, not only the greatest, and fiercest, and most hurt∣ful Contests, both among the Professors of <HI>Chri∣stianity</HI> in general, and among <HI>Protestants</HI> in parti∣cular, have arisen; but also such Absurdities, irra∣tional and blasphemous Consequences have ensued,
<PB N="454" REF="003129_0234_0FF0061564BB61A0"/>
as make the Christian Religion odious and hateful to Jews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What makes the Christian Religion hateful to Jews, Turks and Hea∣thens.</NOTE> Turks and Heathens. The Professors of Christianity do chiefly divide, in this matter, into Three Opinions:</P>
<P>The <HI>First</HI> is of those that say, <HI>The substance of the Bread is Transubstantiated into the very Sub∣stance of that same Body,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Papists</HI> Faith of Christ his Flesh and Blood.</NOTE> <HI>Flesh and Blood of Christ, which was born of the Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>and crucified by the Jews:</HI> So that after the <HI>Words of Consecration</HI> (as they call them) <HI>it is no more Bread, but the Body of Christ.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Luthe∣rans</HI> Faith.</NOTE>The <HI>Second</HI> is of such as say, <HI>The substance of the Bread remains; but that also that Body is in, and with, and under the Bread</HI>: So that <HI>both the substance of Bread, and of the Body, Flesh and Blood of Christ, is there also.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Calvi∣nists</HI> Faith.</NOTE>The <HI>Third</HI> is of those, that (denying both these) do affirm, <HI>That the Body of Christ is not there corporally, or substantially; but yet that it is really &amp; sacramentally received by the Faithful, in the use of Bread and Wine</HI>; But how, or what way it's there, <HI>they know not, nor can they tell; only we must believe it is there; yet so, that it is only properly in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>It is not my design to enter into a Refutation of these several Opinions; for each of their Au∣thors and Assertors have sufficiently refuted one another, and are all of them no less strong, both from Scripture and Reason, in refuting each their contrary Parties Opinion, than they are weak in establishing their own. For I often have seriously observed, in reading their respective Writings, (and so it may be have others) that all of them do notably, in so far as they refute the contrary Opinions; but that they are mightily pained, when they come to confirm and plead for their own. Hence I necessarily must conclude, that none of them had attained to the Truth and Substance of this <HI>Mystery.</HI> Let us see if <HI>Calvin,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> after he had refuted the two former Opinions, be more suc∣cessful
<PB N="455" REF="003129_0234_0FF0061564BB61A0"/>
in what he affirms and asserts for the Truth of his Opinion; who, after he hath much laboured in overturning and refuting the two former Opi∣nions, plainly confesseth, that he he knows not what to affirm instead of them. For after he has spoken much, and at last concluded,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J. Calvin</HI>'s Faith of Christ <HI>his Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> un∣certain.</NOTE> <HI>That the Body of Christ is there, and that the Saints must needs partake thereof</HI>; at last he lands in these words, Sect. 32. <HI>But if it be asked me, how it is? I shall not be ashamed to con∣fess, that it is a secret too high for me to comprehend in my spirit, or explain in words.</HI> Here he deals ve∣ry ingenuously; and yet who would have thought, that such a Man would have been brought to this straight, in the confirming of his Opinion? Con∣sidering but a little before, in the same Chapter, <HI>Sect.</HI> 15. he accuseth the School-Men among the <HI>Papists,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The like the <HI>Papists.</HI></NOTE> (and I confess truly) <HI>In that they neither understand, nor explain to others, how Christ is in the Eucharist</HI>; which shortly after he confesseth himself he cannot do. If then the School-Men among the Papists, do neither understand, nor yet explain to others, their Doctrine in this matter, nor <HI>Calvin</HI> can comprehend it in his spirit, (which I judge, is as much as not to understand it) nor express it in words, (and then surely he cannot explain it to others) then no Certainty is to be had from either of them. There have been great Endeavours used for Reconcilement in this matter, both betwixt <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Lutherans, Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Calvinists</HI>; yea, and <HI>Calvinists</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI>; but all to no purpose: And many Forms and Manners of Expressions drawn up, to which all might yield; which in the end proved in vain, seeing every one under∣stood them, and interpreted them in their own way; and so they did thereby but equivocate and deceive one another. The Reason of this Con∣tention is, because they all wanted a clear Under∣standing of the <HI>Mystery,</HI> and were doting about the <HI>Shadow</HI> and <HI>Externals.</HI> For both the Ground
<PB N="456" REF="003129_0235_0FF0061770DC8F68"/>
and Matter of their Contest lies in things extrinsick from, and unecessary to, the main matter. And this hath been often the Policy of Satan, to busie People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satan bu∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> People in outward Signs, Sha∣dows and Forms, whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they neglect the Substance.</NOTE> and amuse them with outward Signs, Sha∣dows and Forms, making them contend about that, while in the mean time the Substance is neglected; yea, and in contending for these Shadows, he stirs them up to the practice of Malice, Heat, Revenge, and other Vices, by which he establisheth his King∣dom of Darkness among them, and ruines the Life of Christianity. For there have been more Animo∣sities and Heats about this one particular, and more Bloodshed and Contention, than about any other. And surely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hurt∣full to the Reforma∣tion.</NOTE> they are little acquainted with the State of Protestant Affairs, who know not that their Contentions about this, have been more hurt∣ful to the Reformation, than all the opposition they met with from their common Adversaries. Now all those uncertain and absurd Opinions, and the Contentions there-from arising, have proceeded from their all agreeing in two general Errors con∣cerning this thing: Which being denied and re∣ceded from, as they are by us, there would be an easie way made for <HI>Reconciliation</HI>; and we should all meet in the one spiritual and true Understand∣ing of this <HI>Mystery</HI>: And as the Contentions, so would also the Absurdities, which follow from all the three fore-mentioned Opinions, cease and fall to the ground.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Errors the Ground of the Con∣tention about the <HI>Supper.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>First</HI> of these Errors is, in making the Com∣munion or Participation of the Body, Flesh and Blood of Christ, to relate to that outward Body, Vessel, or Temple, that was born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and walked and suffered in <HI>Judea</HI>; where∣as it should relate to the Spiritual Body, Flesh and Blood of Christ, even that <HI>Heavenly</HI> and <HI>Celestial Light</HI> and <HI>Life,</HI> which was the Food and Nourish∣ment of the Regenerate in all Ages, as we have already proved.</P>
<PB N="457" REF="003129_0235_0FF0061770DC8F68"/>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> Error is, in tying this Participation of the Body and Blood of Christ to that Ceremony, used by him with his Disciples, in the breaking of Bread, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as if it had only a Relation thereto, or were only enjoyed in the use of that Ceremony, which it neither hath, nor is. For this is that Bread, which Christ in his Prayer teaches to call for, terming it <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, i. e. the <HI>supersubstan∣tial Bread,</HI> as the Greek hath it, and which the Soul partakes of, without any relation or necessary respect to this Ceremony, as shall be hereafter proved more at length.</P>
<P>These Two Errors being thus laid aside, and the Contentions arising there from buried, all are agreed in the main Positions, <HI>viz.</HI> First, that the <HI>Body,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Believers Souls</HI> do really feed upon the <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> of Christ.</NOTE> <HI>Flesh and Blood of Christ, is necessary for the nourishing of the Soul.</HI> Secondly, that the <HI>Souls of Believers do really and truly partake and feed upon the Body, Flesh and Blood of Christ.</HI> But while Men are not content with the Spirituality of this <HI>Mystery,</HI> going in their own Wills, and according to their own Inventions, to strain and wrest the Scriptures, for to tye this Spiritual Communion of the Flesh and Blood of Christ, to outward Bread and Wine, and such like Carnal Ordinances; no wonder, if by their Carnal Apprehensions, they run into Heaps and Confusion. But because it hath been generally supposed, that the Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ had some special Relation to the Ceremony of <HI>break∣ing Bread</HI>; I shall first refute that Opinion, and then proceed to consider the Nature and Use of that <HI>Ce∣remony,</HI> and whether it be now <HI>necessary</HI> to continue; answering the Reasons and Objections of such as plead its Continuance, as a necessary and standing Ordinance of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="5">§. V. <HI>First,</HI> It must be understood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I.</NOTE> that I speak of a necessary and peculiar Relation, otherwise than in a general respect: For, forasmuch as our Communion with Christ is, and ought to be our

greatest and chiefest Work,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Communi∣on of the <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> has no special Relation to the Ceremo∣ny of speak∣ing <HI>Bread,</HI> neither by Nature nor <HI>Precept.</HI></NOTE> we ought to do all other things with a respect to God, and our Fel∣lowship with him; but a special and necessary Re∣spect or Relation is such, as where the two things are so tied and united together, either <HI>of their own Nature,</HI> or <HI>by the Command of God,</HI> that the one can∣not be enjoyed, or at least is not (except very ex∣traordinarily) without the other. Thus <HI>Salvation</HI> hath a necessary respect to <HI>Holiness,</HI> because <HI>without Holiness no Man shall see God</HI>: And the <HI>eating of the Flesh and Blood of Christ,</HI> hath a necessary respect to our having Life; because if we <HI>eat not his Flesh, and drink not his Blood,</HI> we cannot have <HI>Life:</HI> And our <HI>feeling of God's Presence,</HI> hath a necessary respect to our being found meeting in his Name, by Di∣vine Precept; because he has promised, <HI>where two or three are met together in his Name, he will be in the midst of them.</HI> In like manner our receiving <HI>Be∣nefits</HI> and <HI>Blessings from God,</HI> has a necessary respect to our <HI>Prayer</HI>; because if <HI>we ask,</HI> he hath promised <HI>we shall receive.</HI> Now the Communion or Partici∣pation of the <HI>Flesh and Blood of Christ,</HI> hath no such necessity relation to the <HI>breaking of Bread,</HI> and <HI>drinking of Wine</HI>; for if it had any such necessary Relation, it would either be from the <HI>Nature of the thing,</HI> or from some <HI>Divine Precept:</HI> But we shall shew it is from neither; Therefore, <HI>&amp;c. First,</HI> It is not from the <HI>Nature of it,</HI> because to partake of the Flesh and Blood of Christ, is a Spiritual Exer∣cise; and all confess, that it is by the Soul and Spi∣rit, that we become real partakers of it; as it is the Soul, and not the Body, that is nourished by it: But to eat Bread, and drink Wine, is a natural Act, which in it self adds nothing to the Soul, neither has any thing that is Spiritual in it; be∣cause the most carnal Man that is, can as fully, as perfectly, and as wholly eat Bread and drink Wine, as the most Spiritual. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Their Re∣lation is not <HI>by Nature,</HI> else they would infer one
<PB N="459" REF="003129_0236_0FF0061A8239EE58"/>
another: But all acknowledge, that many eat of the Bread, and drink of the Wine, even that which they say is <HI>Consecrate</HI> and <HI>Transubstantiate into the</HI> very Body <HI>of Christ,</HI> who notwithstanding have not Life Eternal, have not Christ dwelling in them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Patri∣archs</HI> and <HI>Prophets,</HI> without this Ceremony's Use, were true <HI>par∣takers</HI> of <HI>Christ's Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood.</HI></NOTE> nor do live by him; as all do, who truly partake of the Flesh and Blood of Christ, without the use of this Ceremony, as all the Patriarchs and Prophets did, before this Ordinance (as they account it) was instituted. Neither was there any thing un∣der the Law, that had any direct or necessary Re∣lation hereunto; tho' to partake of the Flesh and Blood of Christ, in all Ages, was indispensibly ne∣cessary to Salvation. For as for the <HI>Paschal Lamb,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Paschal Lamb</HI> its End.</NOTE> the whole End of it is signified particularly, <HI>Exod.</HI> 13.8.9. to wit, <HI>That the Jews might thereby be kept in Remembrance of their deliverance out of</HI> Egypt. <HI>Se∣condly,</HI> It has no Relation by <HI>Divine Precept</HI>; for if it had, it would be mentioned in that, which our Adversaries account the Institution of it, or else in the practise of it by the Saints recorded in Scrip∣ture; but so it is not. For as to the <HI>Institution,</HI> or rather <HI>Narration</HI> of Christ's Practice in this matter, we have it recorded by the Evangelists, <HI>Matthew, Mark</HI> and <HI>Luke:</HI> In the first two, there is only an account of the matter of Fact, to wit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 26.16. Mark 14.22 Luk. 22.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>That Christ brake Bread, and gave it his Disciples to eat; saying, This is my Body: And blessing the Cup, he gave it them to drink, saying, This is my Blood</HI>; but nothing of any desire to them to do it. In the last,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Institu∣tion of the <HI>Supper,</HI> or Narration of <HI>Christ's Practice</HI> therein.</NOTE> after the <HI>Bread</HI> (but before the <HI>Blessing,</HI> or giving them the <HI>Wine</HI>) he bids them <HI>do it in Remembrance of him</HI>; what we are to think of this Practice of Christ, shall be spoken of hereafter. But what necessary Relation hath all this, to the Believers partaking of the Flesh and Blood of Christ? The End of this, for which they were to do it (if at all) is, to <HI>remember Christ</HI>; which the Apostle yet more particularly expresses, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.26. <HI>to shew forth
<PB N="460" REF="003129_0237_0FF0061C4E9D2A48"/>
the Lord's Death:</HI> But to <HI>remember the Lord,</HI> or <HI>de∣clare his Death,</HI> which are the special and particu∣lar Ends annexed to the use of this Ceremony, is not at all to partake of the Flesh and Blood of Christ; neither have they any more necessary Re∣lation to it, than any other two different Spiritual Duties. For tho' they that partake of the Flesh and Blood of Christ, cannot but remember him; yet the Lord, and his Death, may be remembred (as none can deny) where his Flesh and Blood is not truly partaken of. So that since the very parti∣cular and express Ceremony may be witnessed (to wit, the remembrance of the Lord's Death) and yet the Flesh and Blood of Christ not partaken of, it cannot have had any necessary Relation to it; else the partaking thereof would have been the end of it, and could not have been attained without this Participation. But on the contrary, we may well infer hence, that since the positive End of this Ceremony, is not the partaking of the Flesh and Blood of Christ, and that whoever par∣takes of the Flesh and Blood of Christ, cannot but remember him; that therefore such need not this Ceremony to put them in remembrance of him.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> But if it be said, <HI>That Jesus Christ calls the Bread here, his</HI> Body; <HI>and the Wine, his</HI> Blood; <HI>therefore he seems to have had a special Relation to his Disci∣ples partaking of his Flesh and Blood, in the use of this thing.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; His calling the Bread his <HI>Body,</HI> and the Wine his <HI>Blood,</HI> would yet infer no such thing; tho' it is not denied, but that Jesus Christ, in all things he did, yea, and from the use of all natu∣ral things, took occasion to raise the Minds of his Disciples to Spirituals. Hence from the Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Woman of</HI> Samaria. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n 4 14</NOTE> her drawing Water, he took occasion to tell her of <HI>that living Water,</HI> which <HI>whoso drink∣eth of, shall never thirst</HI>; which indeed is all one
<PB N="461" REF="003129_0237_0FF0061C4E9D2A48"/>
with his Blood, here spoken of: Yet it will not follow,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Well,</HI> the <HI>Loaves,</HI> the <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine,</HI> Christ takes occasion from, to shew the <HI>Inward Feeding.</HI></NOTE> that that well or Water had any necessary Relation to the <HI>living Water,</HI> or the <HI>living Water</HI> to it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So Christ takes occasion, from the Jews fol∣lowing him for the Loaves, to tell them of this Spi∣ritual Bread and Flesh of his Body, which was more necessary for them to feed upon; it will not there∣fore follow, that their following him for the Loaves, had any necessary Relation thereunto. So also Christ here, being at Supper with his Disciples, takes occasion, from the Bread and Wine which was before them, to signifie unto them, That as that Bread, which he brake unto them, and that Wine, which he blessed and gave unto them, did contri∣bute to the preserving and nourishing of their Bo∣dies; so was he also to give his Body, and shed his Blood, for the Salvation of their Souls. And there∣fore the very End proposed in this Ceremony, to those that observe it, is, to be a <HI>Memorial of his Death.</HI></P>
<P>But if it be said, <HI>That the Apostle,</HI> 1 Cor. 10.16. <HI>calls the Bread which he brake, the Communion of the Body of Christ, and the Cup, the Communion of his Blood.</HI></P>
<P>I do most willingly subscribe unto it; but do deny, that this is understood of the outward Bread, neither can it be evinced; but the contrary is ma∣nifest from the Context: For the Apostle in this Chapter speaks not one word of that Ceremony. For having in the beginning of it shewn them, how the Jews of Old were made Partakers of the <HI>Spiritual Food</HI> and <HI>Water,</HI> which was <HI>Christ,</HI> and how several of them, through Disobedience and Idolatry, fell from that good Condition, he exhorts them, by the Example of those Jews, whom God destroy∣ed of Old, to flee those Evils; shewing them, that they, to wit, the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> are likewise partakers of the Body and Blood of Christ; of which Commu∣nion they would rob themselves, if they did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il;
<PB N="462" REF="003129_0238_0FF0061FA526D570"/>
because <HI>they could not drink of the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils; and partake of the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Table, and the Table of Devils,</HI> vers. 21. Which shews, that he understands not here, the using of outward Bread and Wine; because those that do drink the Cup of Devils,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wick∣edest may take the outward <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine.</HI></NOTE> and eat of the Table of Devils; yea, the wickedest of Men, may partake of the outward Bread and outward Wine. For there the Apostle calls the Bread <HI>One,</HI> vers. 17. and he saith, <HI>We being many, are one Bread, and one Body; for we are all partakers of that One Bread.</HI> Now if the Bread be One, it cannot be the outward, or the inward would be excluded; whereas it cannot be denied, but that it's the partaking of the inward Bread, and not the outward, that makes the Saints truly One Body, and One Bread. And whereas they say, that the One Bread here, comprehendeth both the out∣ward and inward, by vertue of the Sacramental Uni∣on; that indeed is to affirm, but not to prove. As for that <HI>figment,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Sacra∣mental U∣nion</HI> pre∣tended a Figment.</NOTE> of a <HI>Sacramental Union,</HI> I find not such a thing in all the Scripture, especially in the New Testament; nor is there any thing can give a rise for such a thing in this Chapter; where the Apostle, as is above observed, is not at all treat∣ing of that Ceremony; but only from the Excellency of that Priviledge, which the <HI>Corinthians</HI> had, as believing Christians, <HI>to partake of the Flesh and Blood of Christ,</HI> dehorts them from Idolatry, and partaking of the Sacrifices offered to Idols, so as thereby to offend or hurt their weak Brethren.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> But that which they most of all <HI>Cry out</HI> for in this matter, and are always <HI>noising,</HI> is from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. where the Apostle is particularly treating of this matter; and therefore from some words here, they have the greatest Appearance of Truth for their Assertion: As vers. 27. where he calls the <HI>Cup,</HI> the <HI>Cup of the Lord,</HI> and saith, <HI>That they who eat of it, and drink it unworthily, are guilty of the</HI> Body &amp; Blood <HI>of the Lord,</HI> and vers. 26. <HI>Eat and drink their own

Damnation</HI>: Intimating hence, that this hath an immediate or necessary Relation to the Body, Flesh and Blood of Christ. <MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> </P>
<P>Tho' this at first view may catch the unwary Reader, yet being well considered, it doth no ways evince the matter in Controversie. And for the <HI>Corinthians</HI> being in the use of this Ceremony, why they were so, and how that obliges not Christians now to the same, shall be spoken of hereafter: It suffices at this time to consider, that they were in the use of it. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That in the use of it they were guilty of, and committed divers Abuses. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the Apostle here is giving them Directions how they may do it aright, in shew∣ing them the right and proper Use and End of it.</P>
<P>These things being premised, let it be observed, that the very express and particular use of it, ac∣cording to the Apostle, is <HI>to shew forth the Lord's Death,</HI> &amp;c. But <HI>to shew forth the Lord's Death, and partake of the Flesh and Blood of Christ,</HI> are dif∣ferent things. He saith not, <HI>As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye partake of the Body and Blood of Christ</HI>; but, <HI>ye shew forth the Lord's Death.</HI> So I acknowledge, that this Ceremony, by those that practise it, hath an <HI>Immediate Relation</HI> to the outward B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy, and Death of Christ, upon the Cross, as being properly a Memorial of it; but it doth not thence follow, that it hath any <HI>Inward</HI> or <HI>Immediate Relation to Believers communicating or partaking of the spiritual Body and Blood of Christ; or that spiritual Supper,</HI> spoken of <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.20. For tho' in a general way, as every religious Action, in some respect, hath a common Relation to the spi∣ritual Communion of the Saints with God; so we shall not deny but this hath a Relation, as others. Now for his calling <HI>the Cup, the Cup of the Lord,</HI> and saying, <HI>They are guilty of the</HI> Body and Blood <HI>of Christ, and eat their own Damnation, in not discerning
<PB N="464" REF="003129_0239_0FF006218BAF1AA8"/>
the Lord's Body,</HI> &amp;c. I answer, That this infers no more necessary Relation, than any other religious Act; and amounts to no more than this, That since the <HI>Corinthians</HI> were in the use of this Ceremony, and so performed it as a religious Act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ's Act of <HI>Bread</HI> &amp; <HI>Wine</HI> is not obliging others.</NOTE> they ought to do it worthily, or else they should bring Condem∣nation upon themselves. Now this will not more infer the thing so practised by them, to be a ne∣cessary religious Act, obligatory upon others, than when <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.6. the Apostle saith, <HI>He that regard∣eth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord</HI>; it can be thence inferred, that the days, that some esteemed and observed, did lay an Obligation upon others to do the same. But yet, as he that esteemed a day, and placed Conscience in keeping it, was to <HI>regard it to the Lord</HI>; and so it was to him, in so far as he dedicated it unto the Lord, the <HI>Lord's Day</HI>; he was to do it worthily, and if he did it unwor∣thily, he would be guilty of the <HI>Lord's Day,</HI> and so keep it to his own Damnation: So also, such as observe this Ceremony of Bread and Wine, it is to them the <HI>Bread of the Lord,</HI> and the <HI>Cup of the Lord,</HI> because they use it as a religious Act; and forasmuch as their end therein is to <HI>shew forth the Lord's Death,</HI> and <HI>remember his Body</HI> that was Cru∣cified for them, and his <HI>Blood</HI> that was Shed for them. If, notwithstanding they believe it is their Duty to do it, and make it a matter of Consci∣ence to forbear, if they do it without that due Preparation and Examination which every religi∣ous Act ought to be performed in; then, instead of truly remembring the Lord's Death, and his Body, and his Blood, they render themselves guilty of it, as being in one Spirit with those that cru∣cified him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Phari∣sees</HI> guilty of the Blood of the <HI>Pro∣phets.</HI></NOTE> and shed his Blood, tho' pretending with thanksgiving and joy to remember it. Thus the Scribes and Pharisees of old, tho' in Memory of the Prophets they garnished their Sepulchres; yet are said by Christ to be <HI>guilty of their Blood.</HI> And
<PB N="465" REF="003129_0239_0FF006218BAF1AA8"/>
that no more can be hence inferred, appears from another Saying of the same Apostle, Rom. 14.23. <HI>He that doubteth is damned, if he eat,</HI> &amp;c. Where he, speaking of those that judged it unlawful to eat Flesh, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> saith, <HI>If they eat doubting, they eat their own Damnation.</HI> Now it is manifest from all this, that either the doing or forbearing of this, was to another, that placeth no Conscience in it, of no moment. So, I say, he that eateth that, which in his Conscience he is perswaded is not lawful for him to eat, doth eat his own Damnation: So he also, that placeth Conscience in eating Bread and Wine, as a <HI>Religious Act,</HI> if he do it unprepared, and without that due Respect, wherein such Acts should be gone about, he <HI>eateth and drinketh his own Damnation, not discerning the Lord's Body,</HI> i. e. not minding what he doth, to wit <HI>with a special Respect to the Lord, and by way of special Commemoration of the Death of Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="6">§. VI. I having now sufficiently shewn, what the true Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ is, how it is partaken of, and how it has no ne∣cessary Relation to that Ceremony of Bread and Wine, used by Christ with his Disciples;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>II.</HI> Whether this Cere∣mony be a necessary Part of the New Cove∣nant, and Obligatory.</NOTE> it is fit now to consider the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Constitution</HI> of that Ceremony, (for as to the <HI>proper Use</HI> of it, we have had occasion to speak before) whether it be a standing Ordinance in the Church of Christ, obliga∣tory upon all: Or indeed, whether it be any ne∣cessary Part of the Worship of the New Covenant-Dispensation, or hath any better or more binding Foundation, than several other Ceremonies, ap∣pointed and practised about the same time, which the most of our Opposers acknowledge to be ceased, and now no ways binding upon Christians. We find this Ceremony only mentioned in Scripture in four Places, to wit, <HI>Matthew, Mark</HI> and <HI>Luke,</HI> and by <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> If any would infer any thing from the frequency of the mentioning of it,
<PB N="466" REF="003129_0240_0FF00624EC5E71B8"/>
that will add nothing; for it being a matter of Fact, is therefore mentioned by the <HI>Evangelists:</HI> And there are other things, less memorable, as often,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 26 26. Mar. 14.22 Luk. 22.19. 1 Cor. 11.23, &amp;c.</NOTE> yea oftener mentioned. <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI> give only an account of the matter of Fact, with∣out any Precept to do so afterwards; simply de∣claring, that Jesus at that time did desire them to <HI>eat of the Bread, and drink of the Cup:</HI> To which <HI>Luke</HI> adds these words, <HI>This do in remembrance of me.</HI> If we consider this Action of Christ with his Apostles, there will appear nothing singular in it, for a Foundation to such a strange Superstructure, as many in their Airy Imaginations have sought to build upon it; for both <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Mark</HI> ex∣press it as an Act done by him, as he was eating: <HI>Matthew</HI> saith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The break∣ing of <HI>Bread</HI> was no singular thing, but a Custom among the Jews.</NOTE> <HI>And as they were eating</HI>; and <HI>Mark, And as they did eat, Jesus took Bread,</HI> &amp;c. Now this Act was no singular Thing, neither any solemn Institution of a Gospel Ordinance, because it was a constant Custom among the <HI>Jews,</HI> as <HI>Paulus Riccius</HI> observes at length in his <HI>Celestial Agriculture</HI>; that when they did eat the <HI>Passover,</HI> the Master of the Family did take Bread,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. Riccius.</NOTE> and bless it, and breaking it, gave of it to the rest; and likewise taking Wine, did the same: So that there can nothing further appear in this, than that Jesus Christ, <HI>who fullfilled all Righteousness,</HI> &amp; also observed the Jewish Feasts and Customs, used this also among his Disciples only, that, as in most other things, he laboured to draw their Minds to a further thing; so, in the use of this, he takes occasion to put them in mind of his Death and Sufferings, which were shortly to be, which he did the oftener inculcate unto them, for that they were averse from believing it. And as for that Expression of <HI>Luke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>What it is,</HI> To do this in Remem∣brance of Christ.</NOTE> <HI>Do this in remembrance of me</HI>; it will amount to no more, than being the last time that Christ did eat with his Disciples, he desired them, that in their Eating and Drinking they might have regard to him, and by the re∣membering
<PB N="467" REF="003129_0240_0FF00624EC5E71B8"/>
of that opportunity, be the more stirred up to follow him diligently through Sufferings and Death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But what Man of Reason, laying aside the Prejudice of Education, and the Influence of Tradition, will say; That this account of the <HI>mat∣ter of Fact,</HI> given by <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Mark,</HI> or this Expression of <HI>Luke,</HI> to <HI>Do that in Remembrance of him,</HI> will amount to these Consequences, which the generality of Christians have sought to draw from it; as calling it, <HI>Augustissimum Eucharistiae Sacra∣mentum venerabile altaris Sacramentum; the principal Seal of the Covenant of Grace, by which all the Benefits of Christ's Death are sealed to Belivers</HI>; and such like things; But to give a further Evidence, how these Conseqences have not any bottom from the Practice of that Ceremony, nor from the Words following, <HI>Do this,</HI> &amp;c. Let us consider another of the like nature, as it is at length expressed by <HI>John,</HI> c. 13. v. 3, 4, 8, 13, 14, 15. <HI>Jesus riseth from Supper, and laid aside his Garments, and took a Towel, and gird∣ed himself: After that, he poureth Water into a Bason, and began to wash the Disciples Feet, and to wipe them with the Towel wherewith he was girded</HI>: Peter <HI>said unto him, Thou shalt never wash my Feet</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ's Washing of Feet, and its manner related.</NOTE> Jesus <HI>an∣swered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me. So after he had washed their Feet,—he said, Know ye what I have done to you? If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your Feet, ye also ought to wash one anothers Feet: For I have given you an Example, that ye should do, as I have done to you.</HI> As to which, let it be observed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Compared with the Breaking of Bread.</NOTE> that <HI>John</HI> relates this Passage to have been done at the same time with the other of <HI>breaking Bread</HI>; both being done the night of the <HI>Passover,</HI> after Supper. If we regard the Narration of this, and the Circumstances attending it, it was done with far more Solemnity; and prescribed far more Punctually and Particularly, than the former. It is said only, <HI>As he was eating, he took Bread</HI>; so that this would seem to be but an <HI>occasional business:</HI>
<PB N="468" REF="003129_0241_0FF006277A3E7A08"/>
But here, <HI>he rose up, he laid by his Garments, he girded himself, he poured out the Water, he washed their Feet, he wiped them with the Towel:</HI> He did this to all of them; which are Circumstances surely far more observable, than those noted in the other. The <HI>former</HI> was a Practice common among the <HI>Jews,</HI> used by all Masters of Families, upon that occasion; but <HI>this,</HI> as to the manner, and Person acting it, <HI>to wit,</HI> for the Master to rise up, and wash the Feet of his Servants and Disciples, was more singular and observable. In the breaking of Bread, and giving of Wine, it is not pleaded by our Adver∣saries, nor yet mentioned in the Text, that he particularly put them into the hands of all; but breaking it, and blessing it, gave it the nearest, and so they from hand to hand: But here it is mentioned, that he washed not the Feet of one or two, but of many. He saith not in the <HI>former, that if they do not eat of that Bread, and drink of that Wine, they shall be prejudiced by it</HI>; but here he saith expresly to <HI>Peter,</HI> that <HI>if he wash him not, he hath no part with him</HI>; which being spoken upon <HI>Peter</HI>'s refusing to let him wash his Feet, would seem to import no less, than not the Continuance only, but even the Necessity of this <HI>Ceremony.</HI> In the former he saith, as it were, passingly, <HI>Do this in remembrance of me</HI>; but here he sitteth down again, he desires them to consider what he hath done, tells them positively,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Wash∣ing one anothers Feet, was left as an Example.</NOTE> <HI>That as he hath done to them, so ought they to do to one another</HI>: And yet again he re∣doubles that Precept, by telling them, <HI>he has given them an Example, that they should do so likewise.</HI> If we respect the Nature of the thing, it hath as much in it, as either Baptism, or the Breaking of Bread; seeing it is an outward Element of a clean∣sing Nature, applied to the outward Man, by the Command and the Example of Christ, to signifie an inward Purifying. I would willingly propose this seriously to Men, that will be pleased to make
<PB N="469" REF="003129_0241_0FF006277A3E7A08"/>
use of that Reason and Understanding that God hath given them, and not be imposed upon, nor abused by the <HI>Custom</HI> or <HI>Tradition</HI> of others; <HI>Whe∣ther this Ceremony, if we respect either the Time that it was appointed in, or the Circumstances wherewith it was performed, or the Command enjoyning the use of it, hath not as much to recommend it for a</HI> standing Ordinance of the Gospel, <HI>as either</HI> Water-Baptism, <HI>or</HI> Bread <HI>and</HI> Wine, <HI>or any other of that kind?</HI> I wonder then what Reason the Papists can give, why they have not numbered it among their Sacraments, except meerly <HI>Voluntas Ecclesiae &amp; Traditio Patrum.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> But if they say, <HI>That it is used among them, in that the</HI> Pope, <HI>and some other Persons among them, use to do it once a year to some poor People.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I would willingly know, what Reason they have, why this should not be extended to All, as well as that of the <HI>Eucharist,</HI> (as they term it) or whence it appeaas from the Text, that [<HI>Do this in remem∣brance of me</HI>] should be interpreted, that the Bread and Wine were every day to be taken by all <HI>Priests,</HI> or the Bread every day, or every week, by the <HI>People</HI>; and that that other Command of Christ, <HI>Ye ought to do, as I have done to you,</HI> &amp;c. is only to be understood of the <HI>Pope,</HI> or some other Persons, to be done only to a few, and that once a year? Surely, there can be no other Reason for this Difference assigned from the Text. And as to Protestants, who use not this Ceremony at all,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Prote∣stants <HI>use not the</HI> Washing of Feet</NOTE> if they will but open their Eyes, they may see how that by Custom and Tradition they are abused in this matter, as were their Fathers in divers Popish Traditions. For if we look into the plain Scrip∣ture, what can be thence inferred to urge the one, which may not be likewise pleaded for the other; or for laying aside the one, which may not be like∣wise said against the continuance of the other? If they say, <HI>That the former, of washing the Feet, was only a Ceremony</HI>; what have they, whence they can

shew, that this <HI>breaking of Bread</HI> is more? If they say, <HI>That the former was only a sign of Humility and Purifying</HI>; what have they to prove, that this was more? If they say, <HI>That one was only for a time, and was no Evangelical Ordinance</HI>; what hath this to make it such, that the other wanted? Surely there is no way of Reason to evite this: Neither can any thing be alledged, that the one should cease, and not the other; or the one continue, and not the other; but the meer Opinion of the Affirmers, which, by Custom, Education and Tradition, hath begotten in the Hearts of People, a greater Re∣verence for, and Esteem of the one, than the other; which, if it had fallen out to be as much recom∣mended to us by Tradition, would no doubt have been as tenaciously pleaded for, as having no less Foundation in the Scripture. But since the former, to wit, <HI>the washing of one another's Feet,</HI> is justly laid aside, as not binding upon Christians; so ought also the other, for the same Reason.</P>
<P N="7"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Break∣ing</HI> of <HI>Bread</HI> not used now in the same manner, as <HI>Christ did.</HI></NOTE>§. VII.

Or what Reason have they to dispence with the one more than the Papists have to do with the other?

<PB N="473" REF="003129_0243_0FF0062B6FC8BE08"/>
but also of Blood-shed and Devastation: So that in this last respect, the <HI>Prelatick Calvinists</HI> have termed the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> Schismatical and Pertina∣cious, and they them again, Superstitious, Idola∣trous, and Papistical. Who then, that will open their Eyes, but may see, that the Devil hath stir∣red up this Contention and Zeal, to busie Men about things of <HI>small moment,</HI> that <HI>greater matters</HI> may be neglected, while he keeps them in such a∣do about this Ceremony; while they by aside others of the like nature, as <HI>positively Commanded,</HI> and as <HI>punctually Practised</HI>; and from the Observation of which, half so many Difficulties will not follow?</P>
<P N="7">§. VII. How then? Have we not reason, not finding the nature of this Practise to be obliga∣tory upon us, more than those other our Adver∣saries have laid aside, to avoid this Confusion; since those that use it, can never agree, neither concerning the <HI>Nature, Efficacy,</HI> nor <HI>Manner of do∣ing it?</HI> And this proceeds, because they take it not plainly, as it lies in the Scripture; but have so much intermixed their own Inventions. For would they take it, as it lies, it would import no more, than that <HI>Jesus Christ, at that time, did thereby signifie unto them, that his Body and Blood was to be offered for them</HI>; and desired them, that <HI>whensoever they did Eat or Drink, they might do it in Remembrance of him, or with a Regard to him, whose Blood was shed for them.</HI> Now that the Primitive Church, gathered immediately after his Ascension, did so understand it, doth appear from their Use and Practise, if we admit those places of the <HI>Acts,</HI> where <HI>breaking of Bread</HI> is spoken of, to have relation hereto;<NOTE PLACE="marg">By <HI>break∣ing of Bread</HI> they had all things in common; Remember∣ing the Lord.</NOTE> which as our Adversaries do, so we shall willingly agree to: As <HI>first,</HI> Acts 2.42. <HI>And they continued sted∣fastly in the Apostles Doctrine, and Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread,</HI> &amp;c. This cannot be understood of any Other, than of their ordinary Eating; for
<PB N="474" REF="003129_0244_0FEFD74ACF0D5CF0"/>
as nothing else appears from the Text, so the Con∣text makes it plain; for they had all things in common: And therefore it is said, vers. 46. <HI>And they continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking Bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart.</HI> Who will not wilfully close their Eyes, may see here, that their <HI>Breaking</HI> being joyned with their <HI>Eating,</HI> shews, that nothing else is here expressed, but that having all things in common, and so conti∣nuing together, they also did break their Bread and eat their Meat together: In doing whereof, I shall not doubt, but they remembred the Lord; to follow whom they had, with so much Zeal and Resignation, betaken themselves. This is further manifest from <HI>Acts</HI> 6.2. For the Apostles, having the care and distribution of that Money, which the Believers, having sold their Possessions, gave unto them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deacons</HI> appointed for serving at Tables.</NOTE> and finding themselves over charged with that Burthen, appointed <HI>Deacons</HI> for that business, that they might give themselves continually to <HI>Prayer,</HI> and to the <HI>Ministry of the Word</HI>; not leaving that, to serve Tables. This cannot be Meant of any Sacramental Eating, or Religious Act of Worship; see∣ing our Adversaries make the distributing of that, the proper Act of <HI>Ministers,</HI> not of <HI>Deacons:</HI> And yet there can be no Reason alledged, that that Break∣ing of Bread, which they are said to have <HI>continued, in,</HI> and to have done from <HI>House to House,</HI> was other than those <HI>Tables</HI> that the Apostles served; but here gave over, as finding themselves over-charged with it. Now as the Increase of the Disciples did incapacitate the Apostles any more to manage this; so it would seem, their further increase and dis∣persing in divers places, hindred the continuance of that practice of <HI>having things in common:</HI> But notwstanding, so far at least to remember or continue that <HI>ancient Cummunity,</HI> they did at cer∣tain times come together, and break Bread toge∣ther.
<PB N="475" REF="003129_0244_0FEFD74ACF0D5CF0"/>
Hence it is said, Acts 20.7. that <HI>Paul</HI> com∣ing to <HI>Troas, And upon the first Day of the Week,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">At <HI>Troas,</HI> the Supper deferred till Mid∣night.</NOTE> <HI>when the Disciples came together to break Bread,</HI> Paul <HI>preach∣ed unto them, ready to depart on the morrow, and con∣tinued his Speech until Midnight:</HI> Here is no mention made of any Sacramental Eating; but only, that <HI>Paul</HI> took occasion from their being together, to preach unto them. And it seems, it was a Supper they in∣tended (not a Morning-bit of Bread, and Sup of Wine;) else its not very probable, that <HI>Paul</HI> would from the <HI>Morning</HI> have preached until <HI>Mid∣night.</HI> But the 11<HI>th verse</HI> puts the matter out of dispute, which is thus, <HI>When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.</HI> This shews, that the Breaking of Bread was deferred till that time; for these Words, [<HI>and when he had broken bread, and eaten,</HI>] do shew, that it had a Relation to the Breaking of Bread before-mentioned, and that that was the Time he did it. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Those Words joined together, [<HI>and when he had broken bread, and eaten, and talked</HI>] shew, it was no Re∣ligious Act of Worship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They only did eat for refreshing the <HI>Body</HI>—</NOTE> but only an Eating for Bodily Refreshment, for which the Christians used to meet together some time: And doing it in God's Fear, and Singleness of Heart, doth notwithstanding difference it from the Eating or Feasting of Profane Persons. And this by some is called a <HI>Love-Feast,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">By some called a <HI>Love-Feast</HI></NOTE> or a being together, not meerly to feed their Bel∣lies, or for outward Ends; but to take thence oc∣casion to eat and drink together, in the Dread and Presence of the Lord, as his People; which Custom we shall not condemn. But let it be observed, that in all the Acts there is no other, nor further men∣tion of this matter. But if that Ceremony had been some solemn Sacrifice, as some will have it, or such a special Sacrament, as others plead it to be; it is strange, that that History, that in many lesser things gives a particular Adcount of the Christians Beha∣viour,
<PB N="476" REF="003129_0245_0FF0062F73CFA048"/>
should have been so silent in the matter: Only we find,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> be∣gan by de∣grees to de∣part from the Primi∣tive Purity</NOTE> that they used sometimes to meet together to break Bread, and eat. Now as the Primitive Christians began by degrees to depart from that Primitive Purity and Simplicity, so also to ac∣cumulate Superstitious Traditions, and vitiate the Innocent Practices of their Predecessors, by the in∣termixing either of Jewish or Heathenish Rites; so also in the Use of this, very early Abuses began to creep in among Christians, so that it was needful for the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to Reform them, and Reprove them therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 11.17 <HI>Concerning the</HI> Supper of the Lord <HI>(so called) Explained.</HI></NOTE> as he doth at large, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. from vers. 17. to the end: Which place we shall parti∣cularly examine, because our Adversaries lay the chief Stress of their matter upon it; and we shall see whether it will infer any more, than we have above granted. <HI>First,</HI> Because they were apt to use that Practice in a Superstitious Mind, beyond the true Use of it, as to make of it some <HI>Mystical Supper of the Lord,</HI> he tells them vers. 20. That their <HI>coming toge∣ther into one place, is not to eat the Lord's Supper</HI>: He saith not, <HI>This is not the right manner to eat</HI>; but, <HI>This is not to eat the Lord's Supper</HI>; because the <HI>Supper of the Lord is Spiritual,</HI> and a <HI>Mystery. Secondly,</HI> He blames them, in that they came together for the <HI>worse,</HI> and not for the <HI>better</HI>; the Reason he gives of this, is, vers. 21. <HI>For in eating every one hath taken before his own Supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken:</HI> Here it is plain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Custom of <HI>Supping in common</HI> was used among Christians.</NOTE> that the Apostle condemns them for that, because this Custom of Supping in general was used among Christians, for to increase their Love, and as a Memorial of Christ's Supping with the Disciples; that they should have so vitiated it, to eat it apart, and to come full, who had abundance, and hungry, who had little at home; whereby the very Use and End of this Practice was lost and perverted: and therefore he blames them, that they did not either eat this in common at home, or reserve their eating till they came all together to the publick Assembly.
<PB N="477" REF="003129_0245_0FF0062F73CFA048"/>
This appears plainly by the following verse 22. <HI>Have ye not Houses to eat and drink in? Or despise ye the Church of God, and shame them that have not?</HI> Where he blames them for their irregular Practice herein, is that they despised to eat orderly, or re∣serve their eating to the publick Assembly; and so shaming such, as not having Houses, nor fulness at home, came to partake of the common Table; who, being hungry, thereby were ashamed, when they observed others come thither full and drunken. Those that without Prejudice will look to the place, will see this must have been the case among the <HI>Corinthians</HI>: For supposing the Use of this to have been then, as now used either by <HI>Papists, Lu∣therans,</HI> or <HI>Calvinists,</HI> it is hard making Sense of the Apostle's words, or indeed to conceive, what was the Abuse the <HI>Corinthians</HI> committed in this thing. Having thus observed what the Apostle said above,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rise of that Cus∣tom.</NOTE> because this Custom of <HI>Eating and Drinking together some time,</HI> had its rise from Christ's Act with the Apostles, the Night he was betrayed; therefore the Apostle proceeds, vers. 23. to give them an account of that: <HI>For I have received of the Lord, that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took Bread,</HI> &amp;c. Those that understand the difference betwixt a <HI>Narration</HI> of a thing, and a <HI>Command,</HI> cannot but see, if they will, that there is no Command in this place, but only an Account of <HI>matter of Fact</HI>; he saith not, <HI>I received of the Lord, that as he took Bread, so I do command it to you to do so likewise</HI>; there is nothing like this in the place: Yea, on the contra∣ry, <HI>vers.</HI> 25. where he repeats Christ's Imperative Words to his Apostles, he placeth them so as they import no Command; <HI>This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me</HI>: And then he adds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>As of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> im∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts no Command of this <HI>Supper.</HI></NOTE> <HI>For as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do shew the Lord's Death, till he come:</HI> But these words [<HI>as often</HI>] import no more a <HI>Command,</HI> than to say,

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; They take two of the chief parts of the Centroversie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere for granted, without proof. <HI>First,</HI> that <HI>(as often)</HI> imports a <HI>Command,</HI> the con∣trary whereof is shewn; neither will they ever be able to prove it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christ's out∣ward and inward <HI>Coming.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Secondly,</HI> That this <HI>Coming,</HI> is understood of Christ's <HI>last Outward Coming,</HI> and not of his <HI>Inward</HI> and <HI>Spiritual,</HI> that remains to be proved: Whereas the Apostle might well under∣stand it of his Inward Coming and Appearance, which perhaps some of those Carnal <HI>Corinthians,</HI> that used to come drunken together, had not yet known; and others, being weak among them, and inclina∣ble to dote upon Outwards, this might have been indulged to them for a season, and even used by those, who knew Christ's Appearance in Spirit, (as other things were, of which we shall speak hereafter) especially by the Apostle, who became <HI>Weak</HI> to the <HI>Weak,</HI> and <HI>All</HI> to <HI>All,</HI> that he might <HI>save some.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">To remem∣ber <HI>Christ's Death</HI> till <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Come</HI> to Arise in the <HI>heart.</HI></NOTE> Now those weak and carnal <HI>Corinthians</HI> might be permitted the use of this, to shew forth, or remember Christ's Death, till he come to arise in them; for tho' such need those outward things to put them in mind of Christ's Death, yet such as are <HI>dead with Christ,</HI> and not only <HI>dead with Christ,</HI> but <HI>buried,</HI> and also <HI>arisen</HI> with him, need not such Signs to remember him: And to such therefore the Apostle saith, <HI>Col.</HI> 3.1. <HI>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God:</HI> But Bread and Wine are not those things that are above, but are things of the Earth. But that this whole matter was a meer Act of Indulgence and Condescention of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> to the weak and carnal <HI>Corinthians,</HI> appears

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> Tho' this might many ways be answered, to wit, That <HI>Prayer</HI> then might as well be <HI>forborn,</HI> to which also the <HI>saving of the Sick</HI> is there ascribed: Yet I shall accept of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Ceremony ought to Cease, its Virtue failing.</NOTE> because I judge indeed that Ce∣remony is ceased; only methinks, since our Adver∣saries, and that rightly, think a Ceremony ought to cease, where the Vertue fails, they ought by the same Rule,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thus Laying on of hands</NOTE> to forbear the <HI>laying on of Hands,</HI> in imi∣tation of the Apostles, since the Gift of the Holy Ghost doth not follow upon it.</P>
<P N="9">§. IX.

The first is <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.17. <HI>For the Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink, but Righteousness and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost:</HI> Here the Apostle evidently shews, that the King∣dom of God, or Gospel of Christ, stands not in Meats and Drinks, and such like things, but in Righteous∣ness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as by the Context doth appear; where he is speaking of the guilt and hazard of judging one ano∣ther about Meats and Drinks. So then, if the King∣dom of God stand not in them, nor the Gospel, nor Work of Christ, then the eating of outward Bread and Wine can be no necessary part of the Gospel-Worship, nor any perpetual Ordinance of it. Ano∣ther is yet more plain of the same Apostle, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.16. the Apostle throughout this whole <HI>second Chapter</HI>
<PB N="481" REF="003129_0247_0FF006372DCA36B8"/>
doth clearly plead for us, and against the Formality and Superstition of our Opposers. For in the begin∣ning he holds forth the great Priviledges Christians have by Christ, who are come indeed to the Life of Christianity; and therefore he desires them, <HI>vers.</HI> 6. <HI>As they have received Christ, so to walk in him; and to beware, lest they be spoiled through Philosphy and vain Deceit, after the Rudiments or Elements of the World, because that in Christ, whom they have received, is all Fulness: And that they are circumcised with the Circumcision made without bands</HI> (which he calls the <HI>Circumcision of Christ) and being buried with him by Baptism, are also arisen with him through the Faith of the Operation of God.</HI> Here also they did partake of the true Baptism of Christ; and being such as are arisen with him, let us see whether he thinks it needful, they should make use of such Meat and Drink, as Bread and Wine, to put them in remembrance of Christ's Death; or whether they ought to be judg∣ed that they did it not; ver. 16. <HI>Let no Man therefore judge you in Meat and Drink:</HI> Is not Bread and Wine Meat and Drink? But why? <HI>Which are a</HI> Shadow <HI>of things to come: But the</HI> Body <HI>is of Christ,</HI> Then since our Adversaries confess that their Bread and Wine is a Sign or Shadow; therefore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">'Tis but a <HI>Sign</HI> and <HI>Shadow,</HI> they confes</NOTE> according to the Apostle's Doctrine, we ought not to be judged in the Observation of it. But is it not fit for those that are <HI>dead with Christ,</HI> to be subject to such Ordinances? See what he saith, <HI>vers.</HI> 22, <HI>Where∣fore, if ye be dead with</HI> Christ <HI>from the Rudiments of the World, why, as tho' living in the World, are ye sub∣ject to Ordinances? (Touch not, tast not, handle not:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">And whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> do perish with the Using.</NOTE> <HI>Which all are to perish with the using) after the Com∣mandments and Doctrines of Men:</HI> What can be more plain? If this serve not to take away the Absolute Necessity of the Use of Bread and Wine, what can it serve to take away? Sure I am, the Reason here given is applicable to them, <HI>which all do perish with the using</HI>; since Bread and Wine perisheth with the
<PB N="482" REF="003129_0248_0FF00638D42CC3B0"/>
using, as much as other things. But Further, if the Use of Water, and Bread and Wine, were that, wherein the very Seal of the New Covenant stood, and did pertain to the chief Sacraments of the Go∣spel and Evangelical Ordinances (so called,) then would not the Gospel differ from the Law, or be preferable to it. Whereas the Apostle shews the difference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Law was Meats and Drinks not so the Gospel.</NOTE> <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.10. in that such kind of Ob∣servations of the <HI>Jews</HI> were as a Sign of the Go∣spel, for that they <HI>stood only in Meats and Drinks, and divers washings.</HI> But if the Gospel-Worship and Service stand in the same, where is the dif∣ference?</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If it be said, <HI>These under the</HI> Gospel <HI>have a</HI> Spiri∣tual Signification.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> So had those under the <HI>Law</HI>: God was the Au∣thor of those, as well as Christ is pretended to be Author of these. But doth not this contending for the use of Water, Bread and Wine, as necessary parts of the Gospel Worship, destroy the Nature of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Law has <HI>Sha∣dows,</HI> the Gospel brings the <HI>Substance.</HI></NOTE> as if the Gospel were a Dispensation of Shadows and not of the Substance? Whereas the Apostle, in that of the <HI>Colossians</HI> above mentioned, argues against the use of these things, as needful to those that are <HI>dead</HI> and <HI>arisen</HI> with Christ, because they are but Shadows. And since, through the whole Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> he argues with the <HI>Jews</HI> to wean them from their Old Worship, for this Reason, because it was <HI>Typical</HI> and <HI>Figurative</HI>: It is agreeable to right Reason, to bring them to another of the same nature? What ground from Scripture or Rea∣son can our Adversaries bring us to evince, that one Shadow or Figure should point to another Shadow or Figure, and not to the Substance? And yet they make the Figure of Circumcision to point to Water-Baptism, and the Paschal Lamb to Bread and Wine. But was it ever known, that one Figure was the <HI>Anti-type</HI> of the other, especially, seeing Protestants make not these their <HI>Anti-types</HI> to have any more
<PB N="483" REF="003129_0248_0FF00638D42CC3B0"/>
Vertue and Efficacy, than the <HI>Type</HI> had? For since as they say, and that truly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Sa∣craments confer not Grace.</NOTE> <HI>That their Sacraments</HI> confer not Grace, <HI>but that is conferred according to the</HI> Faith <HI>of the Receiver</HI>; it will not be denied, but the Faithful among the <HI>Jews</HI> received also Grace in the use of their <HI>Figurative Worship.</HI> And tho' <HI>Papists</HI> boast, that their Sacraments confer Grace <HI>ex opere operato</HI>; yet Experience abundantly proveth the contrary.</P>
<P N="10">§. X.

<PB N="484" REF="003129_0249_0FF0063B6CE57438"/>
we look to <HI>Antiquity,</HI> we find, that in such kind of Observances and Traditions, they were very un∣certain and changeable; so that neither <HI>Protestants</HI> nor <HI>Papists</HI> do observe this Ceremony as they did, both in that they gave it to <HI>young Boys,</HI> and to <HI>little Children</HI>:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Supper</HI> they gave to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Children.</NOTE> And for ought can be learned, the Use of this, and <HI>Infant-Baptism,</HI> are of a like Age; tho' the one be laid aside both by <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Protestants</HI>; and the other, to wit, <HI>Baptism of Infants</HI> be stuck to. And we have so much the less Reason to lay weight upon <HI>Antiquity,</HI> for that, if we consider their profession of Religion, especially as to Wor∣ship, the Ceremonial Part of it, we shall not find any Church now, whether <HI>Popish</HI> or <HI>Protestant,</HI> who differ not widely from them in many things; as <HI>Dallaeus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dalleaus</NOTE> in his Treatise concerning the <HI>Use of the Fathers,</HI> well observeth and demonstrateth.

<P>I shall not nevertheless doubt, but many whose Understandings have been clouded with these <HI>Ce∣remonies</HI> have notwithstanding, by the Mercy of God had some secret Sense of the <HI>Mystery,</HI> which they could not clearly understand, because it was sealed from them, by their sticking to such outward things; and that through that secret sense, diving in their Comprehensions, they run themselves in∣to these Carnal Apprehensions, as imagining the <HI>Substance</HI> of the <HI>Bread</HI> was changed, or that, if the <HI>Substance</HI> was not changed, yet the <HI>Body</HI> was there, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And indeed, I am inclinable very fa∣vourably to judge of <HI>Calvin</HI> in this particular,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Calvin</HI>'s ingeruous Confession commend∣ed.</NOTE> in that he deals so ingeniously to confess, he <HI>neither Comprehends it, nor can Express it in words; but yet by a feeling Experience can say, The Lord is spiritually present.</HI> Now as I doubt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but <HI>Calvin</HI> sometimes

<HEAD><HI>PROPOSITION XIV.</HI> Concerning the Power of the <HI>Civil Magistrate</HI> in Matters purely <HI>Religious,</HI> and pertaining to the <HI>Conscience.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Since God hath assumed to himself the Power and Do∣minion of the <HI>Conscience,</HI> who alone can rightly in∣struct and govern it; therefore it is not lawful for any whosoever, by vertue of any Authority or Principality they bear in the Goverment of this World, to force the <HI>Consciences</HI> of others;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luk. 9.55, 56. Mat. 7.12, 29. Tit. 3.10.</NOTE> and therefore all Killing, Banishing, Fining, Imprisoning, and other such things, which are inflicted upon Men for the alone Exercise of their <HI>Conscience,</HI> or Difference in <HI>Worship</HI> or <HI>Opinion,</HI> proceedeth from the Spirit of <HI>Cain,</HI> the Murtherer, and is contrary to the Truth: Providing always, That no Man, under the Pretence of <HI>Con∣science,</HI> prejudice his <HI>Neighbour</HI> in his Life or Estate, or do any thing destructive to, or inconsistent with <HI>Humane Society;</HI> in which case the <HI>Law</HI> is for the Transgressor, and <HI>Justice</HI> is to be administred upon all, without respect of Persons.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P N="1">§. I. <HI>LIberty of Conscience</HI> from the Power of the Civil Magistrate, hath been of late Years so largely and learnedly handled, that I shall not need to be but brief in it; yet it is to be lamented, that few have walked answerably to this Principle, each pleading it for themselves, but scarce allowing it to others; as hereafter I shall have occasion more at length to observe.</P>
<P>It will be fit in the first place, for clearing of Mistakes, to say something of the State of the <HI>Con∣troversie,</HI> that what follows may be the more clearly underdood.</P>
<P>By [<HI>Conscience</HI>] then, as in the Explanation of the <HI>Fifth</HI> and <HI>Sixth Propositions</HI> I have observed, is to be
<PB N="487" REF="003129_0250_0FF0063DC730AAF0"/>
understood, <HI>That Perswasion of the Mind, which arises from the Understanding's being possessed with the Belief of the Truth or Falsity of any thing:</HI> Which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Con∣science is?</NOTE> tho' it may be false or Evil upon the matter, yet if a Man should go against his Perswasion, or Conscience, he should commit a Sin; because what a Man doth contrary to his Faith, tho' his Faith be wrong, is no ways acceptable to God. Hence the Apostle saith, <HI>Whatsoever is not of Faith, is sin;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 14.23</NOTE> <HI>and he that doubteth, is damned, if he eat:</HI> Tho' the thing might have been lawful to another; and that this doubting to eat some kind of <HI>Meats</HI> (since all the Creatures of God are good, and for the use of Man, <HI>if re∣ceived with Thanksgiving</HI>) might be a Superstition, or at least a Weakness, which were better removed. Hence, <HI>Ames de Cas. Cons.</HI> saith, <HI>The Conscience, altho' erring, doth evermore bind, so as that he sinneth, who doth contrary to his Conscience,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>i. e.</HI> As he supposeth.</NOTE> <HI>because he doth con∣trary to the Will of God, altho' not materially and truly, yet formally and interpretatively.</HI></P>
<P>So the Question is, First, <HI>Whether the Civil Ma∣gistrate hath Power to force Men in things Religious, to do contrary to their Conscience; and if they will not, to punish them in their Goods, Liberties or Lives</HI>? This we hold in the Negative. But <HI>Secondly,</HI> As we would have the <HI>Magistrate</HI> avoiding this extream of incroaching upon Men's Consciences; so on the other hand, we are far from joyning with, or strengthening such <HI>Libertines,</HI> as would stretch the Liberty of their Consciences, to the Prejudice of their <HI>Neighbours,</HI> or to the Ruine of <HI>Humane Society.</HI> We understand therefore by <HI>Matters of Conscience,</HI> such as immediately relate betwixt <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> or <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Men,</HI> that are under the same <HI>Per∣swasion:</HI> As to meet together and worship God in that way, which they judge is most acceptable unto him; and not to incroach upon, or seek to force their Neighbours, otherwise than by Reason, or such other Means, as Christ and his Apostles

And therefore we believe it may be very lawful for a <HI>Christian Church,</HI> if she find any of her Members fall into any Error, after due Admonitions and Instructions, according to Gospel-Order, if she find them Pertinacious, to <HI>cut them off,</HI> from her Fellowship, by the <HI>Sword of the

Hence <HI>Chrysostom</HI> saith well, <HI>(de Anath.) We must condemn and reprove the Evil Doctrines that pro∣ceed from Hereticks; but spare the Men, and pray for their Salvation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">§. II. But that no Man, by vertue of any Power or Principality he hath in the Government of this World, hath Power over the <HI>Consciences of Men,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conscience the Throne of God.</NOTE> is apparent, because <HI>the Conscience of Man, is the Seat and Throne of God in him,</HI> of which God is the alone proper and infallible <HI>Judge,</HI> who by his Power and Spirit, can alone rectifie the Mistakes of <HI>Conscience</HI>; and therefore hath reserved to himself the Power of punishing the Errors thereof, as he seeth meet. Now for the <HI>Magistrate</HI> to assume this, is to take upon him to meddle with things not within the compass of his Jurisdiction; for if this were within the compass of his Jurisdiction, he should be the proper Judge in these things; and also it were needful to him, as an Essential Qualification of his being a <HI>Magistrate,</HI> to be capable to judge in them. But that the <HI>Ma∣gistrate,</HI> as a <HI>Magistrate,</HI> is neither proper Judge in these Cases, nor yet that the Capacity so to be, is requisite in him, as a <HI>Magistrate,</HI> our <HI>Adversaries</HI> can∣not deny; or else they must say, That all the <HI>Hea∣then Magistrates,</HI> were either no <HI>lawful Magistrates,</HI> as wanting something Essential to Magistracy, and this were contrary to the express Doctrine of the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. or else (which is more absurd) that those <HI>Heathen Magistrates</HI> were proper Judges in Matters of <HI>Conscience</HI> amongst <HI>Christians.</HI> As for that Evasion, That the <HI>Magistrate</HI> ought to punish according to the Church Censure and Determina∣tion, which is indeed no less, than to make the
<PB N="490" REF="003129_0252_0FF0063F668363E8"/>
<HI>Magistrate</HI> the <HI>Church's Hang-Man</HI>; we shall have occasion to speak of it hereafter. But if the chief Members of the <HI>Church,</HI> tho' ordained to inform, instruct and reprove, are not to have dominion over the <HI>Faith</HI> nor <HI>Consciences</HI> of the Faithful, is the Apostle expresly affirms, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.24. then far less ought they to usurp this Dominion, or stir up the Magistrate to persecute and murther those, who will not yield to them therein.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>; This pretended Power of the <HI>Magi∣strate,</HI> is both contrary unto, and inconsistent with the Nature of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> which is a thing altoge∣ther extrinsick to the Rule and Government of <HI>Political States,</HI> as Christ expresly signified, saying, His <HI>Kingdom</HI> was <HI>not of this World</HI>: And if the Pro∣pagating of the <HI>Gospel</HI> had had any necessary Rela∣tion thereunto, then Christ had not said so. But he abundantly hath shewn, by his Example, whom we are chiefly to imitate in matters of that Na∣ture, that it's by <HI>Perswasion,</HI> and the <HI>Power of God</HI>; not by <HI>Whips, Imprisonments, Banishments</HI> and <HI>Mur∣therings,</HI> that the Gospel is to be propagated; and that those, that are the Propagators of it, are often to suffer by the Wicked, but never to cause the Wicked to suffer. When he sends forth his Disci∣ples, he tells them, he sends them forth as <HI>Lambs among Wolves,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 10.16.</NOTE> to be willing to be <HI>devoured,</HI> not to <HI>devour</HI>; he tells them of their being <HI>whipped, im∣prisoned</HI> and <HI>killed</HI> for their Conscience; but never that they shall ever <HI>whip, imprison</HI> or <HI>kill</HI>: And in∣deed, if <HI>Christians</HI> must be as <HI>Lambs,</HI> it is not the Nature of <HI>Lambs</HI> to destroy or devour any. It serves nothing to alledge, That in Christ's and his Apostles times, the <HI>Magistrates</HI> were <HI>Heathens</HI>; and therefore Christ and his Apostles (nor yet any of the Believers) being no <HI>Magistrates,</HI> could not exercise the Power: Because it cannot be denied, but Christ, being the <HI>Son of God,</HI> had a true Right to all <HI>Kingdoms,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 28.18.</NOTE> and was <HI>righteous Heir</HI> of the Earth.
<PB N="491" REF="003129_0252_0FF0063F668363E8"/>
<HI>Next,</HI> as to his <HI>Power,</HI> it cannot be denied, but he could, if he had seen meet, have called for <HI>Legions of Angels</HI> to defend him, and have forced the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Potentates</HI> of the Earth to be subject unto him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 26.53. So that it was only, because it was contrary to the Nature of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Gospel and Mini∣stry, to use any Force or Violence in the gathering of Souls to him. This he abundantly expressed in his Reproof to the two Sons of <HI>Zebedee,</HI> who would have been calling for <HI>Fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Heaven,</HI> to burn those that refused to receive Christ: It is not to be doubted, but this was as great a Crime, as now to be in an Error concerning the Faith and Doctrine of Christ. That there was not Power wanting, to have punishing those Refusers of <HI>Christ,</HI> cannot be doubted; for they that could do other Miracles, might have done this also. And moreover, they wanted not the precedent of a holy Man under the Law, as did <HI>Elias</HI>; yet we see what Christ saith to them, <HI>Ye know not what Spirit ye are of,</HI> Luke 9.55. <HI>For the Son of Man is not come to destroy Men's Lives, but to save them.</HI> Here Christ shews, that such kind of <HI>Zeal</HI> was no ways approved of him; and such as think to make way for <HI>Christ,</HI> or his <HI>Gospel,,</HI> by this means, do not understand what <HI>Spirit they are of.</HI> But if it was not lawful to call for <HI>Fire from Heaven,</HI> to destroy such as refused to receive Christ; it is far less lawful to kindle <HI>Fire upon Earth</HI> to destroy those that believe in Christ; because they will not believe, nor can believe as the Magistrates do, for Conscience sake. And if it was not lawful for the Apostles, who had so large a measure of the Spirit, and were so little liable to Mistake, to force others to their Judgment; it can be far less lawful now for Men, that, as Experience declareth, and many of themselves confess, are Fallible, and often Mistaken, to kill and destroy all such, as cannot (because otherwise perswaded in their Minds) judge and believe in matters of Con∣science,
<PB N="492" REF="003129_0253_0FF0064112A48988"/>
just as they do. And if it was not ac∣cording to the Wisdom of <HI>Christ,</HI> who was and is <HI>King of Kings,</HI> by outward Force to constrain others to believe him, or receive him, as being a thing inconsistent with the Nature of his <HI>Ministry</HI> and <HI>Spiritual Government</HI>; do not they grosly offend him, that will needs be wiser than he, and think to force Men, against their Perswasion, to conform to their Doctrine and Worship? The Word of the Lord said, <HI>Not by Power and by Might, but by the Spirit of the Lord,</HI> Zach. 4.6. But these say, <HI>Not by the Spirit of the Lord, but by Might and Carnal Power.</HI> The Apostle saith plainly, <HI>We wrestle not with Flesh and Blood</HI>; and, <HI>The Weapons of our Warfare are not Carnal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 10.4.</NOTE> <HI>but Spiritual:</HI> But these Men will needs wrestle with Flesh and Blood, when they cannot prevail with the Spirit and the Understanding; and not having Spiritual Weapons, go about with Car∣nal Weapons, to establish Christ's Kingdom, which they can never do: And therefore, when the mat∣ter is well sifted, it is found to be more out of <HI>Love to Self,</HI> and from a Principle of Pride in Man, to have all others to bow to him, than from the <HI>Love of God.</HI> Christ indeed takes another method, for he saith, <HI>He will make his People a willing People in the Day of his Power:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 10.31.</NOTE> But these Men labour against Mens Wills and Consciences, not by <HI>Christ's Power,</HI> but by the <HI>Outward Sword,</HI> to make Men the <HI>People of Christ,</HI> which they can never do, as shall hereafter be shewn.</P>
<P>But <HI>Thirdly</HI>; Christ fully and plainly declareth to us his sense in this Matter, in the Parable of the <HI>Tares,</HI> Mat. 13. of which we have himself the Interpreter, <HI>vers.</HI> 38, 39, 40, 41, where he Ex∣pounds them to be the <HI>Children of the Wicked One</HI>; and yet he will not have the Servants to meddle with them, lest they pull up the <HI>Wheat</HI> there∣with. Now it cannot be denied, but <HI>Hereticks</HI> are here included; but these Servants saw the <HI>Tares,</HI>
<PB N="493" REF="003129_0253_0FF0064112A48988"/>
and had a certain discerning of them; yet Christ would not they should meddle, lest they should hurt the <HI>Wheat</HI>; Thereby intimating, that that Ca∣pacity in Man, <HI>to be mistaken</HI>; ought to be a Bridle upon him, to make him wary in such matters; and therefore, to prevent this hurt, he gives a positive Prohibition, <HI>But he said, Nay,</HI> vers. 22. So that they, that will notwithstanding be pulling up that, which they judge is <HI>Tares,</HI> do openly declare, that they make no Bones to break the <HI>Commands of Christ.</HI> Miserable is that Evasion, which some of our Adversaries use here, in alledging, these <HI>Tares</HI> are meant of <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> and not of <HI>Hereticks</HI>! But how to evince that, seeing <HI>Hereticks,</HI> as well as <HI>Hypocrites,</HI> are <HI>Children of the Wicked One,</HI> they have not any thing, but their own bare Affirmation, which is therefore justly rejected.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If they say, <HI>Because Hypocrites cannot be discerned, but so may Hereticks.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> This is both false, and a begging of the Question. For those that have a <HI>Spiritual discerning,</HI> an discern both <HI>Hypocrites</HI> and <HI>Hereticks</HI>; and those that want it, cannot certainly discern either: Seeing the Que∣stion will arise, <HI>Whether that is a Heresie, which the Magistrate saith is so?</HI> And seeing it is both Possible and Confessed by all, to have often fallen out, that some Magistrates have judged that <HI>Heresie,</HI> which was not; punishing Men accordingly for <HI>Truth,</HI> instead of <HI>Error</HI>: There can no Argument be drawn from the Obviousness or Evidence of <HI>Heresie,</HI> unless we should conclude, <HI>Heresie</HI> could never be mistaken for <HI>Truth,</HI> nor <HI>Truth</HI> for <HI>Heresie</HI>; whereof Experience shews daily the contrary, even among Christians. But neither is this Shift applicable to this place; for the Servants did discern the <HI>Tares,</HI> and yet were liable to hurt the <HI>Wheat,</HI> if they had offered to pull them up.</P>
<P N="3"><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> §. III. But they object against this <HI>Liberty of Con∣science,</HI> Deut. 13.5. <HI>where false Prophets are appointed

to be put to Death; and accordingly they give Exam∣ple thereof.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> The Case no ways holds parallel; those particular Commands to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and Practises following up∣on them, are not a Rule for <HI>Christians</HI>; else we might by the same Rule say, It were lawful for us to borrow of our Neighbours their Goods, and so carry them away, because the <HI>Jews</HI> did so by <HI>God's Command</HI>; or that it is lawful for <HI>Christians</HI> to in∣vade their Neighbours Kingdoms, and cut them all off without Mercy, because the <HI>Jews</HI> did so to the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> by the Command of God.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If they urge, <HI>That these Commands ought to stand, except they be Repealed in the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I say, The Precepts and Practices of Christ and his Apostles mentioned, are a sufficient Repeal: For if we should plead, that every Command given to the <HI>Jews,</HI> is binding upon us, except there be a particular Repeal; then it would follow, that be∣cause it was lawful for the <HI>Jews,</HI> if any Man killed one, for the nearest of kindred presently to kill the Murtherer, without any order of Law, it were law∣ful for us to do so also. And doth not this Com∣mand of <HI>Deut.</HI> 13.9. openly order him, who is en∣ticed by another to forsake the Lord, tho' it were his <HI>Brother,</HI> his <HI>Son,</HI> his <HI>Daughter,</HI> or his <HI>Wife,</HI> pre∣sently to kill him or her? <HI>Thou shalt surely kill him, thy hand shall be first upon him, to put him to death.</HI> If this Command were to be followed, there needed neither <HI>Inquisition</HI> nor <HI>Magistrate</HI> to do the business; and yet there is no reason, why they should shuffle by this part, and not the other; ye, to argue this way, from the Practice among the <HI>Jews,</HI> were to overturn the very Gospel, and to set up again the Carnal Ordinances among the <HI>Jews,</HI> to pull down the Spiritual Ones of the <HI>Gospel.</HI> Indeed we can far better argue from the <HI>Analogy</HI> betwixt the <HI>Figura∣tive</HI> and <HI>Carnal</HI> State of the Jews, and the <HI>Real</HI> and <HI>Spiritual</HI> One under the Gospel: That <HI>as</HI> Moses <HI>de∣livered
<PB N="495" REF="003129_0254_0FF00644776E2B98"/>
the Jews out of outward</HI> Egypt, <HI>by an outward Force, and established them in an outward Kingdom, by destroying their outward Enemies for them; so Christ, not by overcoming outwardly, and killing others, but by suffering and being killed, doth deliver his chosen Ones, the inward Jews, out of mystical</HI> Egypt, <HI>destroying their Spiritual Enemies before them, and establishing among them his Spiritual Kingdom, which is not of this World.</HI> And as <HI>such, as departed from the Fellowship of out∣ward</HI> Israel, <HI>were to be cut off by the outward Sword; so those, that depart fom the inward</HI> Israel, <HI>are to be cut off by the Sword of the Spirit:</HI> For it answers very well, That <HI>as the Jews were to cut off their Enemies outwardly, to establish their Kingdom and outward Wor∣ship, so they were to uphold it the same way.</HI> But <HI>as the Kingdom and Gospel of Christ was not to be established or propagated by cutting off or destroying the Gentiles, but by perswading them, so neither is it to be upheld otherwise.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> But <HI>Secondly,</HI> they urge <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. where the <HI>Ma∣gistrate</HI> is said <HI>not to bear the Sword in vain, because he is the Minister of God, to execute Wrath upon such as do evil. But Heresie,</HI> say they, <HI>is evil.</HI> Ergo.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> But so is <HI>Hypocrisie</HI> also; yet they confess, he ought not to punish that. Therefore this must be understood of <HI>Moral Evils,</HI> relative of Affairs be∣twixt Man and Man, not of Matters of <HI>Judgment</HI> or <HI>Worship</HI>; or else what great Absurdities would follow, considering that <HI>Paul</HI> wrote here to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> who was under the Government of <HI>Nero,</HI> an impious <HI>Heathen,</HI> and <HI>Persecutor</HI> of the <HI>Church?</HI> Now if a Power to punish, in point of <HI>Heresie,</HI> be here included, it will necessarily fol∣low, that <HI>Nero</HI> had this Power; yea, and that he had it of God; for because the <HI>Power</HI> was of God, therefore the Apostle urges their Obedience. But can there be any thing more absurd, than to say, that <HI>Nero</HI> had Power to judge in such Cases? Surely if <HI>Christian Magistrates</HI> be not to punish for <HI>Hypo∣crisie,</HI>
<PB N="496" REF="003129_0255_0FF00647707EEAC0"/>
because they cannot outwardly discern it; far less could <HI>Nero</HI> punish any Body for <HI>Heresie,</HI> which he was uncapable to discern. And if <HI>Nero</HI> had not power to judge or punish in point of <HI>Heresie,</HI> then nothing can be urged from this place; since all that's said here, is spoken, as applicable to <HI>Nero,</HI> with a particular Relation to whom, it was written. And if <HI>Nero</HI> had such a Power, surely he was to exercise it, according to his Judgment and Conscience, and in doing thereof he was not to be blamed; which is enough to justifie him in his persecuting of the Apostles, and murdering the Christians.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>Thirdly,</HI> They object that Saying of the Apostle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> 5.12. <HI>I would they were even cut off, which trouble you.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> But how this imports any more, than a <HI>cutting off from the Church,</HI> is not, nor can be shewn. <HI>Beza</HI> upon the place saith, <HI>We cannot understand that other∣wise, than of Excommunication; such as was that of the incestuous</HI> Corinthian. <HI>And indeed it is madness to suppose it otherwise; for</HI> Paul <HI>would not have these cut off otherwise, than he did</HI> Hymenaeus <HI>and</HI> Philetus, <HI>who were Blasphemers; which was by giving them over to Satan, not by cutting off their Heads.</HI></P>
<P>The same way may be answered that other Ar∣gument, drawn from <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.20. where the <HI>Church of</HI> Thyatira <HI>is reproved for suffering the Woman</HI> Je∣zabel: What can be no other ways understood, than that they did not <HI>Excommunicate</HI> her, or cut her off by a Church-Censure. For as to Corporal Punishment, it is known, that at that time the <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> had not Power to punish <HI>Hereticks</HI> so, if they had had a mind to it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>Fourthly,</HI> They alledge, that <HI>Heresies are num∣bered among the Works of the Flesh,</HI> Gal. 5.20. <HI>Ergo,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> That <HI>Magistrates</HI> have Power to punish all the Works of the Flesh, is denied, and not yet proved.
<PB N="497" REF="003129_0255_0FF00647707EEAC0"/>
Every <HI>Evil</HI> is a Work of the Flesh, but every <HI>Evil</HI> comes not under the Magistrate's Cognisance. Is not <HI>Hypocrisie</HI> a Work of the Flesh, which our Ad∣versaries confess, the Magistrates ought not to punish? Yea, are not <HI>Hatred</HI> and <HI>Envy</HI> there mentioned, as Works of the Flesh? And yet the Magistrates can∣not punish them, as they are in themselves, until they exert themselves in other Acts, which come under his Power. But so long as <HI>Heresie</HI> doth not exert it self in any Act destructive to Humane So∣ciety, or such like things, but is kept within the Sphere of those Duties of <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> which stand betwixt a Man and God, they no ways come under the Magistrate's Power.</P>
<P N="4">§. IV. But <HI>Secondly</HI>; This forcing of Men's Con∣sciences, is contrary to <HI>sound Reason,</HI> and the very <HI>Law of Nature.</HI> For Man's Understanding cannot be forced, by all the Bodily Sufferings another Man can inflict upon him, especially in Matters Spiritual and Supernatural: <HI>'Tis Argument, and evident De∣monstration of Reason, together with the Power of God reaching the Heart, that can</HI> change a Man's Mind <HI>from one Opinion to another, and not Knocks and Blows, and such like things; which may well</HI> destroy the Body, <HI>but can never</HI> inform the Soul, <HI>which is a free Agent, and must either accept or reject matters of Opinion as they are born in upon it, by something proportional to us own nature.</HI> To seek to force Minds in any other man∣ner, is to deal with Men, as if they were Brutes, void of Understanding; and at last, is but to lose one's labour, and as the Proverb is, <HI>To seek to wash the Black moor white.</HI> By that Course indeed, Men may be made Hypocrites, but can never be made Christians; and surely the Products of such Compul∣sion (even where the End is obtained, to with an outward Assent or Conformity, whether in Doctrine or Worship) can be no ways acceptable to God, who desireth not any Sacrifice, except that, which cometh throughly from the Heart, and will have
<PB N="498" REF="003129_0256_0FF00649B89CB4D0"/>
no constrained ones: So that Men, by constrained Force, are so far from being Members of the Church, that they are made ten-times more the Servants of Satan, than before; in that to their <HI>Error,</HI> is added <HI>Hypocrisie,</HI> the worst of Evils in the matters of Religion, and that which above all things the Lord's Soul most abhors.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> But if it be said, <HI>Their Error notwithstanding is there∣by supressed, and the</HI> Scandal <HI>removed.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; Besides that this is a method no ways allowed by Christ, as is above proved; surely the Church can be no ways bettered by the Accession of Hypocrites, but greatly corrupted and endangered; for open Heresies Men may be aware of, and shun such as profess them, when they are seperated from the Church by her Censures: But secret Hypocrites may putrifie the Body, and leaven it, ere Men be aware. And if the Dissenters prove resolute, and suffer boldly for the Opinions they esteem right, Experience sheweth, that such Sufferings often tend to the Commendation of the Sufferers, but never of the Persecutors. For such Sufferings ordinarily breed Compassion, and beget a Curiosity in others, to enquire the more diligently into the things, for which they see Men suffer such great Losses so boldly; and is also able to beget an Opinion, that it is for some good they do so suffer: It being no ways pro∣bable, that Men will venture all, meerly to acquire Fame; which may as well be urged, to detract from the Reputation of all the Martyrs, unless some bet∣ter Arguments be brought against it, than a <HI>Halter</HI> or a <HI>Faggot.</HI> But supposing this Principle, <HI>That the</HI> Magistrate <HI>hath Power to force the Consciences of his Subjects, and to punish them, if they will not comply:</HI> Very great Inconveniences and Absurdities will follow, and even such as are inconsistent with the Nature of the Christian Religion.</P>
<P>For <HI>First,</HI> It will naturally follow, that the Ma∣gistrate ought to do it, and sinneth by omission
<PB N="499" REF="003129_0256_0FF00649B89CB4D0"/>
of his Duty, if he do it not. Will it not then hence be inferred, that Christ was defective to his Church; who, having Power to force Men, and to call for <HI>Legions of Angels</HI> so to do, did notwith∣standing not exert that Power, but left his Church to the Mercy of the Wicked, without so necessary a Bulwark?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>; Seeing every Magistrate is to exercise his Power, according to the best Understanding he hath, being obliged so to do, for the promo∣ting of what he in Conscience is perswaded to be Truth: Will not this justifie all the Heathen Em∣perors in their Persecutions against Christians? Will not this justifie the <HI>Spanish Inquisition,</HI> which yet is Odious not only to Protestants, but to many mode∣rate Papists? How can Protestants in reason condemn the Papists for persecuting them, seeing they do but exercise a Lawful Power, according to their Con∣science and best Understanding; and do no more to them, than the Sufferers profess they would do to them, if they were in the like capacity? Which takes away all ground of Commiseration from the Sufferers; whereas that was the ground that gain∣ed of old, Reputation to the Christians, that they, being Innocent, suffered, who neither had, nor by Principle could, hurt any. But there is little rea∣son to pity one, that is but dealt by, according as he would deal with others. For to say, <HI>They have not reason to persecute us, because they are in the wrong, and we in the right,</HI> is but miserably to beg the Question. Doth not this Doctrine strengthen the Hands of Persecutors every where, and that Ra∣tionally, from a Principle of Self-preservation? For who can blame me for destroying him, that I know waits but for an occasion to destroy me, if he could? Yea, this makes all Suffering for Re∣ligion, which of old was the Glory of Christians, to be but of pure necessity; whereby they are not led as <HI>Lambs to the slaughter,</HI> as was the <HI>Captain of
<PB N="500" REF="003129_0257_0FF0064C341F3B30"/>
their Salvation</HI>; but rather as <HI>Wolves</HI> catched in the Snare, who only bite not again, because they are not able; but could they get force, would be as ready to lead those the same way, that led them. Where is the Faith and Patience of the Saints? For indeed, it is but a small Glory to make a Vertue of Necessity, and Suffer, because I cannot help it. Every Thief and Murtherer would be a Martyr, at that rate; Experience hath abundantly proved this in these last Centuries. For, however each Party talk of <HI>passively</HI> obeying the Magistrate in such cases, and that the Power resides in him; yet it is appa∣rent, that from this Principle it naturally follows, than any Party, supposing themselves right, should so soon as they are able, endeavour at any rate to get uppermost, that they might bring under those of another Opinion, and force the Magistrate to uphold their Way, to the ruine of all others. What Engine the Pope of <HI>Rome</HI> used to make of his pre∣tended Power in this thing, upon any pretence of dislike to any Prince or State, even for very small Heresies, in their own account, to depose Princes, and set up their Subjects against them, and give their Dominions to other Princes to serve his In∣terest, they cannot be ignorant, that have read the Life of <HI>Hildebrand</HI>; and how Protestants have vindicated the Liberty of their Consciences, after this same manner, is apparent. They suffered much in <HI>France,</HI> to the great Increase and Advantage of their Party; but how soon they found themselves considerable, and had gotten some Princes upon their side, they began to let the King know, that they must either have the Liberty of their Con∣sciences, or else they would purchase it; not by Suffering, but by Fighting. And the Experience of other Protestant States shews, that if <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, to please the Papists, had not quitted his Religion, to get the Crown the more peaceably, and so the Protestants had prevailed with the Sword,
<PB N="501" REF="003129_0257_0FF0064C341F3B30"/>
they would as well have taught the Papists with the Faggot, and led them to the Stake: So that this Principle of Persecution, on all hands, is the ground of all those Miseries and Contentions. For so long as any Party is perswaded, that it is both lawful for them, and their duty, if in power, to destroy those that differ from them; it naturally follows, they ought to use all means possible to get that Power, whereby they may secure themselves in the ruine of their Adversaries. And that <HI>Papists</HI> judge it not unlawful to compel the Magistrate, if they be strong enough to do it, to effect this; Experience shews it to be a known Popish principle, That <HI>the Pope may depose an Heretick Prince, and ab∣solve the People from the Oath of Fidelity:</HI> And the Pope, as is above said, hath done so to divers Princes; and this Doctrine is defended by <HI>Bel∣larmine</HI> against <HI>Barclay.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> refused <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, till he quitted his Religion. And as for Protestants, many of them scruple not to affirm, <HI>That</HI> wicked Kings <HI>and</HI> Magistrates <HI>may be deposed and killed</HI>; yea, our <HI>Scotch Presbyterians</HI> are as positive in it, as any <HI>Jesuits</HI>; who would not admit King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, tho' otherwise a Protestant Prince, unless he would sweat to Renounce <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> a matter of a great difference, tho' contrary to his Conscience. Now how little proportion these things bear with the Primitive Christians, and the Religion propagated by Christ and his Apostles, needs no great demonstration; and it is observable, That notwithstanding many other Superstitions crept into the Church very early, yet this of Per∣secution was so inconsistent with the Nature of the Gospel, and Liberty of Conscience, as we have as∣serted it, such an innate and natural part of the Christian Religion, that almost all the Christian Writers, for the first Three Hundred Years, ear∣nestly contended for it, condemning the contrary Opinion.</P>

<P>Now, how either Papists or Protestants (that boast of <HI>Antiquity</HI>) can get by these plain Testimonies, let any Rational Man judge.

the Doctrine of their own <HI>Sect-master</HI>: Which they omitted not frequently to twit them with; and indeed it was to them unanswerable.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Protestant Persecution strengthens the Popish Inquisition.</NOTE>So that this Doctrine of <HI>Persecution</HI> cannot be maintained by <HI>Protestants,</HI> without strengthening the Hands of <HI>Popish Inquisitors</HI>; and indeed, in the end, lands in direct <HI>Popery.

not that by Beatings and Banishments it must be knocked into them.</P>
<P N="6">§. VI. Now the ground of Persecution, as hath been above shewn, is an <HI>unwillingness to suffer</HI>; for no Man, that will persecute another for his <HI>Conscience,</HI> would suffer for his own, if he could avoid it, seeing his Principle obliges him, if he had power, by force to establish that which he judges is the Truth, and so to force others to it. Therefore I judge it meer, for the Information of the Nations, briefly to add something in this place concerning the <HI>Nature of true Christian Sufferings</HI>; whereunto a very faithful Testimony has been born by God's Witnesses, which he hath raised up in this Age, beyond what hath been generally known or practised for these many Generations, yea, since the Apostasie took place. Yet 'tis not my design here in any wise to derogate from the Sufferings of the Protestant Martyrs, whom I believe to have walked in Faithfulness towards God, according to the Dispensation of <HI>Light</HI> in that Day appearing, and of which many were utter Ene∣mies to Persecution, as by their Testimonies against it might be made appear.</P>
<P>But the True, Faithful and Christian Suffering is, <HI>for, Men to profess what they are perswaded is right, and so practise and perform their Worship towards God, as being their true right so to do; and neither to do more in that, because of outward incouragement from Men; nor any whit less, because of the fear of their Laws and Acts against it.</HI> Thus for a Christian Man to vindicate his just Liberty, with so much Boldness, and yet Innocency, will in due time, tho' through Blood, purchase Peace; as this Age has in some measure Experienced, and many are Witnesses of it; which yet shall be more apparent to the World, as <HI>Truth</HI> takes place in the Earth. But they greatly sin against this excellent Rule, that in time of Persecu∣tion do not profess their own way, so much as they would, if it were otherwise; and yet, when they
<PB N="508" REF="003129_0261_0FF0065618A697B8"/>
can get the Magistrate upon their side, not only stretch their own Liberty to the utmost, but seek to establish the same, by denying it to others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inno∣cent Suffer∣ings of the People call'd, <HI>Qua∣kers.</HI></NOTE>But of this excellent Patience and Sufferings, the Witnesses of God, in scorn called <HI>Quakers,</HI> have given a manifest proof: For so soon as God re∣vealed his <HI>Truth</HI> among them, without regard to all Opposition, or what they might meet with, they went up and down, as they were moved of the Lord, preaching and propagating the <HI>Truth</HI> in Mar∣ket-places, High ways, Streets, and publick Tem∣ples, tho' daily beaten, whipped, bruised, halled and imprisoned therefor. And when there was any where a Church or Assembly gathered, they taught them to keep their Meetings openly, and not to shut the Door, nor do it by stealth, that all might know it, and who would might enter. And as hereby all just occasion of fear of Plotting against the Government was fully removed, so this their Courage and Faithfulness, in not giving over their meeting together (but more especially the Presence and Glory of God, manifested in the Meeting, being terrible to the Consciences of the Persecutors) did so weary out the Malice of their Adversaries, that often-times they were forced to leave their Work undone. For when they came to break up a Meeting, they were forced to take every Individual out by force; they not being free to give up their Liberty, by dissolving at their Com∣mand; And when they were halled out, unless they were kept forth by Violence, they present∣ly returned peaceably to their place. Yea, when sometimes the Magistrates have pulled down their Meeting-houses, they have met the next day openly upon the Rubbish, and so by Innocency kept their Possession and Ground, being properly their own, and their right to meet and worship God being not forfeited to any. So that when Armed Men have come to dissolve them, it was
<PB N="509" REF="003129_0261_0FF0065618A697B8"/>
impossible for them to do it, unless they had killed every one; for they stood so close together, that no force could move any one to stir, until vio∣lently pull'd thence: So that when the Malice of their Opposers stirred them to take Shovels, and throw the Rubbish upon them, there they stood unmoved, being willing, if the Lord should so per∣mit, to have been there buried alive, witnessing for him. As this Patient, but yet Couragious way of Suffering, made the Persecutors work very heavy and wearisom unto them; so the Courage and Pa∣tience of the Sufferers, using no Resistance, nor bringing any Weapons to defend themselves, not seeking any ways Revenge upon such occasions, did secretly smite the Hearts of the Persecutors, and made their Chariot-wheels go on heavily: Thus after much and many kind of Sufferings thus pati∣ently born, which to rehearse would make a Vo∣lume of it self, which may in due time be pub∣lished to the Nations, (for we have them upon Record) a kind of <HI>Negative Liberty</HI> has been ob∣tained, so that at present for the most part we meet together without disturbance from the Magi∣strate. But on the contrary, most <HI>Protestants,</HI> when they have not the allowance and toleration of the Magistrate, meet only in secret, and hide their Testimony; and if they be discovered, if there be any probability of making their escape by force (or suppose it were by cutting off those that seek them out) they will do it; whereby they lose the Glory of their Sufferings, by not appearing as the innocent Followers of Christ, nor having a Testi∣mony of their Harmlesness in the Hearts of their Pursuers; their Fury, by such resistance, is the more kindled against them. As to this last part, of resisting such as persecute them, they can lay claim to no Precept from Christ, nor any Exam∣ple of him, or his Apostles approved.</P>
<PB N="510" REF="003129_0262_0FF006597242DA10"/>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> But as to the first part, for fleeing and meet∣ing secretly, and not openly testifying for the Truth, they usually object that Saying of Christ, Mat. 10.23. <HI>When they persecute you in this City, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee ye into another.</HI> And <HI>Acts</HI> 9.4. <HI>That the Disciples met secretly, for fear of the Jews.</HI> And <HI>Acts</HI> 9.25. <HI>That</HI> Paul <HI>was let out of</HI> Damascus <HI>in a Basket down by the Wall.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> To all which I answer, <HI>First,</HI> As to that Saying of Christ, it is a Question, if it had any further Relation, than to that particular Message, with which he sent them to the <HI>Jews</HI>; yea, the latter end of the words seem expresly to hold forth so much, <HI>For ye shall not have gone over the Cities of</HI> Juda, <HI>till the Son of Man be come.</HI> Now a particular Practice or Command, for a particular time, will not serve for a Precedent to any, at this day, to shun the Cross of Christ. But supposing this Precept to reach farther, it must be so understood, to be made use of only according as the Spirit giveth liberty; else no Man that could flee,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fleeing in time of Per∣secution, not allowed.</NOTE> might suffer Persecution. How then did not the Apostles, <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> flee, when they were the first time persecuted at <HI>Jerusalem?</HI> But on the contrary, went the next day, after they were discharged by the Council, and preached boldly to the People. But indeed many are but too capable to stretch such Sayings as these for Self-preservation, and therefore have great ground to fear, when they interpret them, that they shun to witness for Christ, for fear of hurt to themselves, lest they mistake them. As for that private meet∣ing of the Disciples, we have only an account of the matter of Fact, but that suffices not to make of it a Precedent for us, and Mens aptness to imi∣tate them in that (which, for ought we know, might have been an Act of Weakness) and not in other things of the contrary nature, shews, that it is not a true Zeal to be like those Disciples, but indeed a Desire to preserve themselves, which
<PB N="511" REF="003129_0262_0FF006597242DA10"/>
moves them so to do. <HI>Lastly,</HI> As to that of <HI>Paul</HI>'s being conveyed out of <HI>Damascus,</HI> the case was sin∣gular, and is not to be doubted, but it was done by a special Allowance from God, who having de∣signed him to be a principal Minister of his Gospel, saw meet, in his Wisdom, to disappoint the wicked Council of the <HI>Jews.</HI> But our Adversaries have no such Pretext for fleeing, whose fleeing proceeds from Self-Preservation, not from Immediate Revelation. And that <HI>Paul</HI> made not this the method of his procedure, appears, in that at another time, not∣withstanding the perswasion of his Friends, and certain Prophecies of his Sufferings to come, he would not be disswaded from going up to <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> which according to the fore mentioned Rule, he should have done.</P>
<P>But <HI>Lastly,</HI> To conclude this matter, Glory to God, and our Lord Jesus Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To this year <HI>17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3</HI> is <HI>53.</HI> years.</NOTE> that now these <HI>Twenty Five Years,</HI> since we were known to be a di∣stinct and separate People, hath given us faithfully to suffer for his <HI>Name,</HI> without shrinking or fleeing the Cross; and what Liberty we now enjoy, it is by his Mercy, and not by any outward Working or Procuring of our own, but 'tis He has wrought upon the Hearts of our Opposers. Nor was it any outward Interest hath procured it unto us, but the Testimony of our Harmlesness in the Hearts of our Superiours: For God hath preserved us hitherto in the patient Sufferings of Jesus, that we have not given away our Cause by persecuting any, which few, if any, Christians that I know can say. Now against our Unparallell'd, yet innocent and Christian Cause, our Malicious Enemies have nothing to say, but that if we had Power, we would do so likewise. This is a piece of meer unreasonable Malice, and a Privi∣ledge they take to judge of things to come, which they have not by Immediate Revelation; and sure∣ly it is the greatest heighth of harsh Judgment to say, Men would do contrary to their professed Prin∣ciple,
<PB N="512" REF="003129_0263_0FF0065B674446D0"/>
if they could, who have from their Practice hitherto given no ground for it, and wherein they only judge others by themselves: Such Conjectures cannot militate against us, so long as we are Inno∣cent. And if we ever prove guilty of Persecution, by forcing other Men by Corporal Punishment to our way, then let us be judged the greatest of Hy∣pocrites, and let not any spare to persecute us. <HI>Amen, saith my Soul.</HI></P>

<P N="1">§. I. HAving hitherto treated of the Principles of Religion, both relating to <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Worship</HI>; I am now to speak of some Practises, which have been the product of this Principle, in those Witnesses whom God hath raised up in this day, to testifie for his <HI>Truth.</HI> It will not a little commend them (I suppose) in the judgment of Sober and Judi∣cious Men, that taking them generally (even by the Confession of their Adversaries) they are found to be free of those Abominations, which abound among other Professors, such as are <HI>Swearing, Drunkenness, Whoredom, Riotousness,</HI> &amp;c. and that generally the very coming among this People doth naturally work such a Change, so that many Vicious and Pro∣fane Persons have been known, by coming to this <HI>Truth,</HI> to become Sober and Vertuous; and many Light, Vain and Wanton ones, to become Grave and Serious, as our Adversaries dare not deny: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After it is manner, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Papists</HI> used to disapprove the So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aldenses,</HI> of whom <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inerus</HI> a Popish Author so writeth.

<PB N="514" REF="003129_0264_0FF0065ED9FDFDE0"/>
and to <HI>Enthusiasm</HI>; tho' before, when among them, it was esteem'd neither <HI>Melancholly</HI> not <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> in an evil sense, but <HI>Christian Gravity,</HI> and <HI>Divine Revela∣tion.</HI> Our <HI>Boldness</HI> and <HI>Christian Suffering,</HI> they call <HI>Obstinacy</HI> and <HI>Pertinacy</HI>; tho' half as much, if among themselves, they would account <HI>Christian Courage</HI> and <HI>Nobility.</HI> And tho' thus, by their Envy, they strive to read all relating to us backwards, counting those things Vice in us, which in themselves they would extol as Vertues; yet hath the strength of Truth extorted this Confession often from them, <HI>That we are generally a pure and clean People, as to the outward Conversation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But this,</HI> they say, <HI>is but in Policy to commend our Heresie.</HI></P>
<P>But such Policy it is, say I, as Christ and his Apostles made use of, and all good Christians ought to do; yea, so far hath Truth prevailed by the Purity of its Followers, that if one that is called a <HI>Quaker,</HI> do but that which is common among them, as to <HI>laugh,</HI> and be <HI>wanton, speak at large,</HI> and keep not his <HI>word</HI> punctually, or be overtaken with <HI>hasti∣ness,</HI> or <HI>anger,</HI> they presently say, <HI>O this is against your Profession</HI>! As if indeed so to do were very consistent with theirs; wherein tho' they speak the Truth, yet they give away their Cause. But if they can find any, under our Name, in any of those Evils common among themselves, (as who can imagine, but among so many Thousands, there will be some Chaff, since of Twelve Apostles, one was found to be a Devil) O how will they insult, and make more Noise of the escape of one <HI>Quaker,</HI> than of an Hun∣dred among themselves.</P>
<P N="2">§. II. But there are some singular things, which most of all our Adversaries plead for the lawful∣ness of, and allow themselves in, as no ways in∣consistent with the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> which we have found to be no ways lawful unto us, and have been commanded of the Lord to lay them aside; tho'
<PB N="515" REF="003129_0264_0FF0065ED9FDFDE0"/>
the doing thereof hath occasioned no small Suffer∣ings and Bufferings, and hath procured us much Hatred and Malice from the World. And because the Nature of these things is such, that they do upon the very sight distinguish us, and make us known, so that we cannot hide our selves from any, without proving Unfaithful to our Testimo∣ny; our Trials and Exercises have here through proved the more numerous and difficult, as will after appear. These I have laboured briefly to comprehend in this Proposition; but they may more largely be exhibited in these Six following Propositions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That it is not lawful to give to Men such flat∣tering Titles, as</HI> Your Holiness, Your Majesty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flattering Titles,</NOTE> Your Eminency, Your Excellency, Your Grace, Your Lord∣ship, Your Honour, <HI>&amp;c. nor use those flattering Words, commonly called,</HI> COMPLEMENTS.</P>

<P N="5">5. <HI>That it is not lawful for Christians to swear at all under the Gospel, not only not vainly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Swearing.</NOTE> <HI>and in their common discourse, which was also forbidden under the</HI> Mosaical <HI>Law, but even not in Judgment, before the Magistrate.</HI></P>

<PB N="516" REF="003129_0265_0FF006608126BD20"/>
<P>Before I enter upon a particular Disquisition of these things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Degrees of Dignity &amp; Precedency allowed.</NOTE> I shall first premise some general Con∣siderations, to prevent all Mistakes; and next add some general Considerations, which equally respect all of them. I would not have any judge, that hereby we intend to destroy the <HI>mutual Relation,</HI> that either is betwixt <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>People, Master</HI> and <HI>Servants, Parents</HI> and <HI>Children</HI>; nay, not at all: We shall evidence, that our Principle in these things hath no such Tendency, and that these Natural Re∣lations are rather better established, than any ways hurt by it. <HI>Next,</HI> Let not any judge, that from our opinion in these things, any necessity of <HI>Level∣ling</HI> will follow, or that all Men must have things in <HI>common.</HI> Our Principle leaves every Man to enjoy that peaceably, which either his own Industry, or his Parents, have purchased to them; only he is thereby instructed to use it aright, both for his own good, and that of his Brethren; and all to the Glory of God: In which also his Acts are to be <HI>voluntary,</HI> and no ways <HI>constrained.</HI> And further, we say not hereby, that no Man may use the Crea∣tion more or less than another: For we know, that as it hath pleased God to dispense it diversly, giving to some more, and some less, so they may use it accordingly. The several Conditions, under which Men are diversly stated,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Education differs ac∣cordingly.</NOTE> together with their Educa∣tions answering thereunto, do sufficiently shew this: The <HI>Servant</HI> is not the same way Educated, as the <HI>Master</HI>; nor the <HI>Tenant,</HI> as the <HI>Landlord</HI>; nor the <HI>Rich,</HI> as the <HI>Poor</HI>; nor the <HI>Prince,</HI> as the <HI>Peasant.</HI> Now, tho' it be not lawful for any, however great Abundance they may have, or what ever then Education may be, to use that which is meerly superfluous: Yet seeing their Education has accustomed them thereunto, and their Capacity enables them so to do, without being Profuse or Extravagant, they may use things better in their kind, than such whose Education hath neither accustomed them to such things, nor their Capacity
<PB N="517" REF="003129_0265_0FF006608126BD20"/>
will reach to compass them. For it is beyond que∣stion, that whatever thing the Creation affords,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The lawful or unlaw∣ful Use of the Creation</NOTE> is for the use of Man, and the moderate use of them is lawful; yet, <HI>per accidens,</HI> they may be unlawful to some, and not to others. As for instance, he that by reason of his Estate and Education hath been used to eat <HI>Flesh</HI> and drink <HI>Wine,</HI> and to be cloathed with the <HI>finest Wool,</HI> if his Estate will bear it, &amp; he use it neither in Superfluity, nor Immoderately, he may do it; and perhaps, if he should apply himself to feed or be cloathed, as are the Peasants, it might prejudice the Health of his Body, and nothing ad∣vance his Soul. But if a Man, whose Estate and Education had accustomed him to both <HI>courser Food</HI> and <HI>Rayment,</HI> should stretch himself beyond what he had, or were used to, to the manifest prejudice of his Family and Children, no doubt it would be unlawful to him, even so to eat or be cloathed, as another, in whom it is lawful; for that that other may be as much mortified, and have denied himself as much in coming down to that, which this aspires to, as he is willing to be like him, aspires beyond what he either is able, or hath accustomed to do. The safe place then is, for such as have Fulness, to watch over themselves, that they use it moderate∣ly, and rescind all Superfluities; being willing, so far as they can, to help the reed of those, to whom Providence hath allotted a smaller allowance. <HI>Let the Brother of high degree rejoyce, in that he is abased,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rich to help the Needy.</NOTE> <HI>and such as God calls in a low degree, to be content with their Condition, not envying those Brethren, who have greater abundance,</HI> knowing <HI>they have received abun∣dance, as to the inward Man</HI>; which is chiefly to be regarded. And therefore beware of such a Temp∣tation, as to use their Calling as an Engine to be <HI>Richer,</HI> knowing, they have this advantage beyond the <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Noble</HI> that are called, that the Truth doth not any ways abase them, nay, not in the esteem of the World, as it doth the other; but
<PB N="518" REF="003129_0266_0FF006632F097930"/>
that they are rather exalted thereby, in that as to the inward and Spiritual Fellowship of the Saints, they became the Brethren and Companions of the greatest and richest; and in this respect, <HI>let him of low degree rejoyce, that he is exalted.</HI></P>
<P>These things premised, I would seriously propose unto all such, as mind in reality to be Christians in∣deed, and that in <HI>Nature,</HI> and not in <HI>Name</HI> only; Whether it were not desirable, and would not greatly contribute to the Commendation of Chri∣stianity, and to the Increase of the Life and Vertue of Christ, <HI>if all superfluous Titles of Honour, Profuse∣ness and Prodigality in Meat and Apparel, excess of Gaming, Sporting and Playing,</HI> were laid aside and forborn? And whether such as lay them aside, in so doing, walk not more like the Disciples of Christ and his Apostles, and are therein nearer their Ex∣ample, than such as use them? Whether the lay∣ing them aside would hinder any from being good Christians? Or if Christians might not be better with∣out them, than with them? Certainly the Sober and Serious among all sorts, will say, <HI>Yea.</HI> Then surely such as lay them aside, as reckoning them unsuita∣ble for Christians, are not to be blamed, but rather commended for so doing: Because that in Principle and Practice, they effectually advance that, which others acknowledge were desirable; but can ne∣ver make effectual, so long as they allow the use of them as lawful. And God hath made it mani∣fest in this Age, that by discovering the Evil of such things, and leading his Witnesses out of them, and to testifie against them, he hath produced ef∣fectually in many that Mortification and Abstraction from the <HI>Love and Cares of this World,</HI> who daily are Conversing in the World (but inwardly Re∣deemed out of it) both in Wedlock, and in their lawful Imployments, which was judged, could only be obtained by such as were shut up in Cloysters and Monasteries. Thus much in general.</P>
<PB N="519" REF="003129_0266_0FF006632F097930"/>
<P N="3">§. III. As to the <HI>first,</HI> we affirm positively, That <HI>it is not lawful for Christians either to give or receive these Titles of Honour, as,</HI> Your Holiness, Your Maje∣sty, Your Excellency, Your Eminency, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Titles.</NOTE> Because these <HI>Titles</HI> are no part of that Obedience, which is due to Magistrates or Supe∣riours; neither doth the giving them add to, or diminish from that Subjection we owe to them, which consists <HI>in obeying their just and lawful Com∣mands,</HI> not in <HI>Titles</HI> and <HI>Designations.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We find not, that in the Scripture any such Titles are used, either under the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Under the Law and Gospel.</NOTE> or the Gospel: But that in the speaking to Kings, Princes, or Nobles, they used only a simple Compellation, as, <HI>O King!</HI> And that without any further Designa∣tion, save perhaps the Name of the Person, as, <HI>O King</HI> Agrippa, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lying Titles.</NOTE> It lays a Necessity upon Christians most frequently to Lye; because the Persons, obtaining these Titles, either by Election, or Hereditarily, may frequently be found to have nothing really in them, deserving them, or answering to them: As some, to whom it is said, <HI>Your Excellency,</HI> having nothing of <HI>Excellency in them</HI>; and who is called, <HI>Your Grace,</HI> appear to be an Enemy to <HI>Grace</HI>; and he who is called <HI>Your Honour,</HI> is known to be <HI>Base and Ignoble.</HI> I wonder what Law of Man, or what Patent ought to oblige me to make a Lye,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Patents</HI> do not oblige to a Lye.</NOTE> in cal∣ling <HI>Good, Evil</HI>; and <HI>Evil, Good?</HI> I wonder what Law of Man can secure me, in so doing, from the just Judgment of God, that will make me count for <HI>every idle Word?</HI> And to <HI>Lye</HI> is something more. Surely Christians should be ashamed, that such Laws, manifestly crossing the Law of God, should be among them.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If it be said, <HI>We ought in Charity to suppose, that they have these Vertues, because the King has bestowed those Titles upon them, or that they are descended of such, as deserved them.</HI></P>
<PB N="520" REF="003129_0267_0FF0066624126BB8"/>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer, <HI>Charity</HI> destroys not <HI>Knowledge</HI>: I am not obliged by <HI>Charity,</HI> either to believe or speak a <HI>Lye.</HI> Now it is apparent, and cannot be denied by any, but that those Vertues are not in many of the Persons, expressed by the Titles they bear; neither will they allow to speak so to such, in whom these Vertues are, unless they be so digni∣fied by outward Princes. So that such as are truly Vertuous, must not be stiled by their Vertues, be∣cause not priviledged by the Princes of this World; and such as have them not, must be so called, be∣cause they have obtained a Patent so to be: And all this is done by those, who pretend to be his Followers, that commanded his Disciples, <HI>not to be called of Men, Master</HI>; and told them, such could <HI>not believe, as received Honour one from another, and sought not the Honour which cometh from God only.</HI> This is so plain, to such as will indeed be <HI>Christians,</HI> that it needs no Consequence.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> As to those Titles of, <HI>Holiness, Eminen∣cy</HI> and <HI>Excellency,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Your Holi∣ness, Your Grace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> used among the Papists to the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Cardinals,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>Grace, Lordship</HI> and <HI>Wor∣ship,</HI> used to the Clergy among the Protestants, it is a most Blasphemous Usurpation. For if they use <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> because these things ought to be in a Pope or in a Bishop, how come they to usurp that peculiarly to themselves? Ought not Holiness and Grace to be in every Christian? And so every Christian should say, <HI>Your Holiness</HI> and <HI>Your Grace,</HI> one to another. <HI>Next,</HI> how can they in reason claim any more Titles than were pra∣ctised and received by the Apostles and Primitive Christians, whose Successors they pretend they are and as whose Successors (and no otherwise) them∣selves, I judge, will confess any Honour they seek is due to them. Now if they neither sought, re∣ceived, not admitted such Honour nor Titles, how came these by them? If they say, They did; let them prove it if they can: We find no such thing
<PB N="521" REF="003129_0267_0FF0066624126BB8"/>
in the Scripture. The Christians speak to the Apo∣stles without any such Denomination, neither say¦ing, <HI>If it please Your Grace, Your Holiness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hypocrites want Titles</NOTE> <HI>Your Lord¦ship,</HI> nor <HI>Your Worship</HI>; they are neither called, <HI>My Lord</HI> Peter, nor <HI>My Lord</HI> Paul; nor yet <HI>Master</HI> Pe∣ter, nor <HI>Master</HI> Paul; nor <HI>Doctor</HI> Peter, nor <HI>Doctor</HI> Paul; but singly <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI>; and that not only in the Scripture, but for some Hundreds of Years after: So that this appears to be a manifest Fruit of the Apostasie. For if these <HI>Titles</HI> arise either from the <HI>Office</HI> or <HI>Worth</HI> of the Persons, it will not be denied, but the Apostles deserved them better than any now, that call for them. But the Case is plain, the Apostles had the Holiness, the Excellency, the Grace; and because they were Holy, Excellent and Gracious, they neither used, nor admitted of such Titles: But these having neither Holiness, Ex∣cellency nor Grace, will needs be so called, to satis∣fie their ambitious and ostentatious Mind, which is a manifest Token of their Hypocrisie.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> As to that Title of <HI>Majesty,</HI> usually ascribed to Princes, we do not find it given to any such in the Holy Scripture; but that it is specially and pe∣culiarly ascribed unto God, as 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.11. <HI>Job</HI> 37.22. <HI>Psalm</HI> 21.5. &amp; 29 4. &amp; 43.3. &amp; 63.1. &amp; 96.6. <HI>Isai.</HI> 2.10. &amp; 24.14. &amp; 26.10. <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.3. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.16. and many more places. Hence saith <HI>Jude,</HI> vers. 25. <HI>To the only wise God, our Saviour, be Glory and Majesty,</HI> &amp;c. not to Men. We find in Scrip∣ture the proud King <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> assuming this Title to himself, <HI>Dan.</HI> 4.30. who at that time re∣ceived a sufficient Reproof, by a sudden Judgment which came upon him. Therefore in all the Com∣pellations used to Princes in the Old Testament, it is not to be found, nor yet in the New. <HI>Paul</HI> was very civil to <HI>Agrippa,</HI> yet he gives him no such Title: Neither was this Title used among Christians in the Primitive Times. Hence the Ecclesiastical Hi∣story of the Reformaiion of <HI>France,</HI> relating the
<PB N="522" REF="003129_0268_0FF0066979289568"/>
Speech of the Lord <HI>Rochefort,</HI> at the Assembly of the Estates of <HI>France,</HI> held under <HI>Charles</HI> the Ninth, in the Year 1590. saith, <HI>That this Harangue was well remarked,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el. Hist. lib. <HI>4.</HI> p. <HI>445.</HI></NOTE> <HI>in that he used not the word</HI> [Majesty] <HI>invent∣ed by Flatterers of late Years.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Your Ma∣jesty</HI> not u∣sed; How taken No∣tice of in <HI>1560.</HI></NOTE> And yet this Author minded not how his Master <HI>Calvin</HI> used this Flatter∣ing Title to <HI>Francis</HI> the First, King of <HI>France</HI>; and not only so, but calls him most <HI>Christian King,</HI> in the Epistle to his <HI>Institutions</HI>; tho' by his daily Perse∣cuting of the Reformers, it was apparent, he was far from being such, even in <HI>Calvin</HI>'s own esteem. Surely the complying with such vain <HI>Titles,</HI> imposed and introduced by <HI>Antichrist,</HI> greatly tended to stain the Reformation, and to render it defective in many things.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> All these <HI>Titles</HI> and <HI>Stiles</HI> of <HI>Honour</HI> are to be rejected by <HI>Christians</HI>; because they are to seek the <HI>Honour that comes from above,</HI> and not the <HI>Honour</HI> that is from <HI>below:</HI> But these Honours are not that Honour that comes from above, but are from below. For we know well enough, what in∣dustry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The proud Mind loves Titles.</NOTE> and what pains Men are at to get these things, and what party it is that seeks after them, to wit, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Proud, Insolent, Haughty, Aspiring Mind,</HI> For judge, Is it the <HI>meek</HI> and <HI>innocent Spirit of Christ,</HI> that covets that Honour? Is it that Spirit, that must be of <HI>no Reputation in this World,</HI> that has its <HI>Conver∣sation in Heaven,</HI> that comes to have <HI>fellowship with the Sons of God?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 3.20.</NOTE> Is it that Spirit, I say, that loves that Honour, that seeks after that Honour, that pleads for the upholding of that Honour, that frets, and rages, and fumes, when it is denied that Honour?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lucifer's Spirit.</NOTE> Or is it not rather the lordly insulting Spirit of <HI>Lucifer,</HI> the <HI>Prince of this World,</HI> he that of old affected and sought after this Honour, and loved not to abide in the submissive, low Place? And so all his Children are possessed with the same ambitious proud Mind, seeking and coveting Titles of Honour, which indeed belong not to them. For
<PB N="523" REF="003129_0268_0FF0066979289568"/>
let us examine, <HI>Who they are, that are Honourable in∣deed?</HI> Is it not the Righteous Man?<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Sam 2.30.</NOTE> Is it not the Holy Man? Is it not the Humble hearted Man, the Meek-spirited Man? And are not such those that ought to be honoured among Christians? Now, of these, may there not be poor Men, Labourers, filly Fisher-Men? And if so, how comes it that the Titles of Honour are not bestowed upon such? But who are they that generally receive and look for this Ho∣nour? Are they not the Rich Ones, such as have abundance of the Earth, as be like the Rich Glut∣ton, such as are Proud and Ambitious, such as are Oppressors of the Poor, such as swell with Lust and Vanity, and all Superfluity of Naughtiness, who are the very Abomination and Plague of the Nations? Are not these they, that are accounted the Ho∣nourable, that require and receive the Titles of Honour, proud <HI>Hamans?</HI> Now, whether is this the Honour, that comes from God, or the Honour from below? Doth God honour such as daily dis∣hour him, and disobey him? And if this be not the Honour, that comes from God, but the Honour of this World, which the Children of this World give and receive one from another; how can the Children of God <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hierom <HI>in his Epistle to</HI> Celant, <HI>admonisheth her,</HI> That she was to be preferred to none for her <HI>Nobility,</HI> for the Christian Religion admits not of Respect of Persons; neither are Men to be esteemed, because of their outward Condition, but according to the Disposition of the Mind, to be esteemed either Noble or Base; he that obeyeth not Sin, is Free; who is strong in Vertue, is Noble. <HI>Let the Epistle of</HI> James <HI>be read.</HI></NOTE>, such as are Christians indeed, give or receive that Honour among themselves, with∣out coming under the Reproof of Christ, who saith, that <HI>such as do, cannot believe?</HI> But further, if we respect the Cause, that most frequently procures to Men these Titles of Honour, there is not One of a Thousand, that shall be found to be, because of any Christian Vertue; but rather for things to be dis∣commended among Christians: As by the Favour of Princes, procured by Flattering, and often by worse means. Yea, the most Frequent, and accounted among
<PB N="524" REF="003129_0269_0FF0066C7A1E0958"/>
Men most Honourable, is <HI>Fighting,</HI> or some great <HI>mar∣tial Exploit,</HI> which can add nothing to a Christian's Worth: Since, sure it is, it were desirable, there were no Fightings among Christians at all; and in so far as there are, it shews they are not right Christians. And <HI>James</HI> tells us, That <HI>Fighting proceeds from the Lusts</HI>; So that it were fitter for Christians, by the <HI>Sword of God's Spirit,</HI> to fight against their Lusts, than by the Prevalancy of their Lusts, to de∣stroy one another. Whatever Honour any might have attained of old, under the <HI>Law,</HI> this way; we find under the Gospel Christians commended for <HI>Suffering,</HI> not for <HI>Fighting</HI>; neither did any of <HI>Christ's Disciples,</HI> save one, offer outward Violence by the Sword, in cutting off <HI>Malchus</HI>'s Ear; for which he received no Title of Honour, but a just Reproof. Fi∣nally, if we look either to the <HI>Nature</HI> of this Honour, the <HI>Cause</HI> of it, the <HI>Way</HI> it's conveyed, the <HI>Terms</HI> in which it is delivered, it cannot be used by such as mind to be Christians in good earnest.</P>
<P N="4">§. IV. Now besides these general Titles of Honour, what gross Abuses are crept in among such as are called Christians, in the use of Complements, wherein not Servants to Masters, or others, with respect to any such kind of Relations, do say and write to one another at every turn, <HI>Your Humble Servant, Your most Obedient Servant,</HI> &amp;c. Such wicked Cu∣stoms have, to the great prejudice of Souls, ac∣customed Christians to lye; and to use lying, is now come to be accounted Civility. O horrid Apostasie! For it is notoriously known, that the use of these Complements imports not any design of Service, neither are any such Fools to think so; for if we should put them to it, that say so, they would not doubt to think, we abused them; and would let us know, they gave us words in course, and no more. It is strange, that such as pretend to Scripture, as their Rule, should not be ashamed to use such things; since <HI>Elihu,</HI> that had not the
<PB N="525" REF="003129_0269_0FF0066C7A1E0958"/>
Scriptures, could by the <HI>Light within them</HI> (which these Men think insufficient) say, <HI>Job</HI> 32.21, 22. <HI>Let me not accept any Man's Person, neither let me give Flattering Titles unto Men. For I know not. to give Flattering Titles; in so doing my Maker would soon take me away.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This History is reported by <HI>Causabonus,</HI> in his Book of <HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Customs,</HI> p. 169.

<P N="5"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Singu∣lar Number</HI> to One Per∣son used in the <HI>Latin.</HI></NOTE>§. V. It will not be unfit in this place, to say something concerning the using of the <HI>Singular Num∣ber</HI> to One Person; of this there is no Controversie in the <HI>Latin.</HI> For when we speak to One, we al∣ways use the <HI>Pronoun,</HI> TU, and he that would do otherwise, would break the Rules of <HI>Grammar.</HI> For what Boy, learning his Rudiments, is ignorant, that it is incongruous to say, <HI>Vos amas, vos legis,</HI> that is, <HI>You lovest, you readest,</HI> speaking to One? But the Pride of Man, that hath corrupted many things, refuses also to use this Simplicity of speak∣ing in the Vulgar Languages. For being puffed up with a vain Opinion of themselves, as if the <HI>Singu∣lar Number</HI> were not sufficient for them, they will have others speak to them in the <HI>Plural.</HI> Hence <HI>Luther,</HI> in his <HI>Plays,</HI> reproves and mocks this manner of speaking, saying, <HI>Magister, vos es iratus</HI>: Which Corruption <HI>Erasmus</HI> sufficiently refutes in his Book of <HI>Writing Epistles</HI>: Concerning which likewise <HI>James H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wel,</HI> in his Epistle to the Nobility of <HI>England,</HI> be∣fore the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English Dictionary,</HI> takes notice, <HI>That both in</HI> France, <HI>and in other Nations, the word</HI> THOU <HI>was used in speaking to One; but by suc∣cess of Time, when the</HI> Roman <HI>Common-wealth grew in∣to an Empire, the Courtiers began to magnifie the Em∣peror, (as being furnished with Power to confer Digni∣ties and Offices) using the word</HI> You, <HI>yea, and deify∣ing him with more remarkable Titles; concerning which matter, we read in the Epistles of</HI> Symmachus <HI>to the Emperors</HI> Theodosius <HI>and</HI> Valentinianus, <HI>where he useth these forms of speaking,</HI> Vestra Aeternitas, <HI>Your Eternity</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the word <HI>You</HI> came to be used to a single Per∣son.</NOTE> Vestrum Numen, <HI>Your Godhead</HI>; Vestra Serenitas, <HI>Your Serenity</HI>; Vestra Clementia, <HI>Your Clemency. So that the Word</HI> You <HI>in the Plural Number, together with the other Titles and Compella∣tions
<PB N="527" REF="003129_0270_0FF0066E36E48550"/>
of Honour, seem to have taken their rise from</HI> Mo∣narchical Government; <HI>which afterwards, by degrees, came to be derived to private Persons.</HI></P>
<P>The same is witnessed by <HI>John Maresius,</HI> of the <HI>French Academy,</HI> in the Preface of his <HI>Clovis: Let none wonder</HI> (saith he) <HI>that the word</HI> Thou <HI>is used in this Work, to</HI> Princes <HI>and</HI> Princesses; <HI>for we use the same to God. And of Old the same was used to</HI> Alexanders, Caesars, Queens <HI>and</HI> Empresses. <HI>The use of the word</HI> You, <HI>when One Person is spoken to, was only introduced by these base Flatteries of Men of latter Ages, to whom it seemed good to use the Plural Number to One Person, that he may imagine himself alone to be equal to many other, in Dignity and Worth; from whence at last it came to Persons of lower Quality.</HI></P>
<P>To the same Purpose speaketh also <HI>M. Godeau,</HI> in his Preface to the New Testament Translation: <HI>I had rather</HI> (saith he) <HI>faithfully keep to the express words of</HI> Paul, <HI>than exactly follow the polished Stile of our Tongue; therefore I always use that form of calling God in the</HI> Singular Number, <HI>not in the</HI> Plural; <HI>and therefore I say rather</HI> Thou <HI>than</HI> You. <HI>I confess indeed, that</HI> Civility <HI>and</HI> Custom of this World <HI>re∣quires him to be honoured after that manner; but it is likewise on the contrary true, That the</HI> Original Tongue <HI>of the New Testament has nothing common with such Manners and Civility; so that not one of these many Old Versions we have, doth observe it. Let not Men believe, that we give not respect enough to God, in that we call him by the word</HI> Thou,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>word Thou,</HI> a greater Honour to One, than <HI>You.</HI></NOTE> <HI>which is nevertheless far otherwise; for I seem to my self (may be by the effect of Custom) more to honour his Divine Majesty, in calling him after this manner, than if I should call him after the manners of Men, who are so delicate in their forms of Speech.</HI></P>
<P>See how clearly and evidently these Men wit∣ness, that this Form of Speaking, and these pro∣fane Titles, derive their Origin from the base Flattery of these last Ages, and from the delicate
<PB N="528" REF="003129_0271_0FF00670C5B672B8"/>
Haughtiness of Worldly Men who have invented these Novelties, that thereby they might Honour one another, under I know not what pretence of Civility and Respect. From whence many of the present Christians (so accounted) are become so Perverse, in commending most wicked Men, and wicked Customs, that the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> is wholly lost; so that the giving of Men and Things their own Names, is not only worn out of Custom, but the doing thereof is accounted Absurd and Rude, by such kind of delicate Parasites, who de∣sire to ascribe to this Flattery, and abuse the Name of Civility. Moreover, that this way of speaking proceeds from a high and proud Mind, hence ap∣pears; because that Men commonly use the Singular Number to Beggars, and to their Servants; yea, and in their Prayers to God. Thus the Superiour will speak to his Inferiour, who yet will not bear, that the Inferiour so speak to him, as judging it a kind of Reproach unto him. So hath the Pride of Men placed God and the Beggar in the same Category. I think I need not use Arguments, to prove to such as know Congruous Language, that we ought to use the Singular Number speaking to One; which is the common Dialect of the whole Scripture, as al∣so the most Interpreters do translate it. Seeing therefore it is manifest to us, that this Form of speaking to Men in the Plural Number, doth pro∣ceed from Pride, as well as that it is in it self a Lye, we found a necessity upon us, to testifie against this Corruption, by using the Singular equally unto All. And albeit no Reason can be given, why we should be Persecuted upon this account, especially by Christians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scripture-Dialect, the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lan∣guage.</NOTE> who profess to follow the Rule of Scripture, whose Dialect this is; yet it would per∣haps seem incredible, if I should relate how much we have suffered for this thing, and how these <HI>proud Ones</HI> have <HI>fume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, fretted,</HI> and <HI>gnashed their Teeth,</HI> fre∣quently beating and striking us, when we have spoken
<PB N="529" REF="003129_0271_0FF00670C5B672B8"/>
to them thus in the Singular Number: Whereby we are the more Confirmed our Judgment, as seeing that this Testimony of Truth, which God hath given us to bear in all things, doth so vex the Serpentine Nature in the Children of Darkness.</P>
<P N="6">§. VI, <HI>Secondly</HI>; Next unto this of Titles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bowing to Men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> the other Part of Honour, used among Christians, is the <HI>Kneeling, Bowing,</HI> and <HI>Uncovering of the Head,</HI> to one another. I know nothing our Adversaries have to plead for them in this matter, save some few Instances of the Old Testament, and the Custom of the Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> are, such as <HI>Abraham</HI>'s <HI>bowing himself to the Children of</HI> Heth, <HI>and</HI> Lot <HI>to the two An∣gels,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But the Practice of these Patriarchs, related <HI>as</HI> matter of Fact, are not to be a Rule to Christians now? Neither are we to imitate them in every Practice, which has not a particular Reproof ad∣ded to it: For we find not <HI>Abraham</HI> reproved for taking <HI>Hagar,</HI> &amp;c. And indeed to say, all things were lawful to us, which they practised, would produce great Inconveniences,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Custom of the Nati∣ons, no Rule to Christians.</NOTE> obvious enough to all. And as to the Customs of the Nations, it's a very ill Argument for a Christian's Practice: We should have a better Rule to walk by, than the Custom of the Gentiles; the Apostles desire us, not to be <HI>conformed to this World,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12.2.</NOTE> We see how little they have to say for themselves in this matter. Let it be observed then, whether our Reasons for laying aside these things, be not considerable, and weighty enough to uphold us in so doing.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI>; We say, <HI>That God, who is the Creator of Man, and he to whom he oweth the Dedication both of Soul and Body, is over all to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Worshipped and Adored, and that not only by the Spirit, but also with the Pro∣stration of Body.</HI> Now Kneeling, Bowing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bowing is Adoring; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only due to God.</NOTE> and Un∣covering of the Head, is the alone outward signifi∣cation of our Adoration towards God, <HI>and therefore
<PB N="530" REF="003129_0272_0FF00672645BC128"/>
it is not lawful to give it unto Man.</HI> He that kneel∣eth, or prostrates himself to Man, what doth he more to God? He that boweth, and uncovereth his Head to the Creature, what hath he reserved to the Creator? Now the Apostle shews us, that the <HI>un overing of the Head</HI> is that, which God requires of us in our worshipping of him, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.4. But if we make our Address to Men in the same man∣ner, where lieth the difference? Not in the out∣ward <HI>Signification,</HI> but meerly in the <HI>Intention</HI>; which opens a door for the Popish Veneration of Images, which hereby is necessarily excluded.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly; Men, being alike by Creation,</HI> (tho' their being stated under their several Relations, requires from them mutual Services, according to those re∣spective Relations) <HI>owe not Worship to one another, but all equally are to return it to God: Because it is to him, and his Name alone, that every Knee must bow, and before whose Throne the four &amp; Twenty Elders prostrate themselves.</HI> Therefore for Men, to take this one from another, is to rob God of his Glory: Since all the duties of Relations may be performed one to another, without these kind of Bowings, which therefore are no essential part of our Duty to Man, but to God. All Men, by an inward instinct, in all Nations, have been led to prostrate and bow themselves to God. And it is plain, that this Bow∣ing to Men took place from a <HI>slavish fear</HI> possessing some, which led them to set up others as Gods; when also an ambitious proud Spirit got up in those others, to usurp the place of God, over their Brethren.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly; We see, that</HI> Peter <HI>refused it from</HI> Corne∣lius, <HI>saying, He was a Man.</HI> Are then the <HI>Popes</HI> more, or more excellent than <HI>Peter,</HI> who suffer Men daily to fall down at their Feet, and kiss them? This Reproof of <HI>Peter</HI> to <HI>Cornelius</HI> doth abundantly shew,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Peter</HI> and he <HI>Angel</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d coming.</NOTE> that such Manners were not to be admit∣ted among Christians. Yea, we see, that the <HI>Angel</HI>
<PB N="531" REF="003129_0272_0FF00672645BC128"/>
twice refused this kind of Bowing from <HI>John,</HI> Rev. 19.10. &amp; 22.9 for this Reason, <HI>Because I am thy Fellow-Servant, and of thy Brethren</HI>; abundantly inti∣mating, that it is not lawful for Fellow Servants, thus to prostrate themselves one to another: And in this respect all Men are Fellow-Servants.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> If it be said, <HI>John intended here a Religious Wor∣ship, and not a Civil.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; This is to say, not to prove: Neither can we suppose <HI>John,</HI> at that time of the Day, so ill instructed, as not to know, it was unlawful to worship Angels; only it should seem, because of those great and mysterious things revealed to him by that Angel, he was willing to signifie some more than ordinary Testimony of Respect, for which he was reproved. These things being thus consider∣ed, it is remitted to the Judgment of such, as are desirous to be found Christians indeed, whether we be found worthy of blame, for waving it to Men. Let those then, that will blame us, consider, whe∣ther they might not as well accuse <HI>Mordecai</HI> of in∣civility, who was no less singular than we,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To forbear <HI>Bowing to</HI> Man is no Incivility, nor Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de, nor Rude∣ness.</NOTE> in this matter. And forasmuch as they accuse us herein of <HI>Rudeness</HI> and <HI>Pride,</HI> tho' the Testimony of our Consciences, in the fight of God, be a sufficient Guard against such Calumnies; yet there are of us, known to be Men of such Education, as forbear not these things for want of that they call <HI>good Breeding</HI>; and we should be very void of Reason, to purchase that Pride at so dear a Rate, as many have done the Exercise of their Conscience in this matter; many of us having been sorely Beaten and Buffetted; yea, and several Months Imprisoned, for no other Reason, but because we could not so sa∣tisfie the <HI>proud unreasonable Humors of proud Men,</HI> as to <HI>uncover our Head,</HI> and <HI>bow our bodies.</HI> Nor doth our innocent Practice, in standing still, tho' upright, not puting off our Hats, any more than our <HI>Shoes,</HI> the one being the Covering of our <HI>Heads,</HI>
<PB N="532" REF="003129_0273_0FF00675932A43E8"/>
as well as the other of our <HI>Feet,</HI> shew so much Rudeness, as their Beating or Knocking us, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> because we cannot Bow to them, contrary to our Consciences, which certainly shews less <HI>Meekness</HI> and <HI>Humility</HI> upon their part, than it doth of <HI>Rude∣ness</HI> or <HI>Pride</HI> upon ours. Now, suppose it were our Weakness, and we really under a Mistake in this thing, since it is not alledged to be the breach of any Christian Precept; are we not to be indulged, as the Apostle commanded should be done to such, as scrupled to <HI>eat Flesh?</HI> And doth not Persecuting and Reviling us upon this account, shew them to be more like unto proud <HI>Haman,</HI> than the Disci∣ples or Followers of the <HI>Meek Self-denying Jesus?</HI> And this I can say boldly, in the sight of God, from my own Experience, and that of many Thou∣sands more, That however small or so foolish this may seem, yet we behoved to choose Death, rather than do it, and that for Conscience sake: And that, in its being so contrary to our Natural Spirits, there are many of us, to whom the forsaking of these Bowings and Ceremonies, was as Death it self: Which we could never have left, if we could have enjoyed our Peace with God, in the use of them. <HI>Tho it be far from us to judge all those, to whom God hath not shewn the evil of them, under the like hazard</HI>; yet nevertheless, we doubt not, but to such as would prove <HI>faithful Witnesses to Christ's Divine Light in their Consciences,</HI> God will also shew the Evil of these things.</P>
<P N="7"><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Apparel,</HI> in its Vanity and Super∣fluity, dis∣allowed.</NOTE>§. VII. The Third thing to be treated of, is the <HI>Vanity and Superflaity of Apparel.</HI> In which <HI>first,</HI> two things are to be considered; the <HI>Condition of the Person,</HI> and the <HI>Country he lives in.</HI> We shall not say, that all Persons are to be cloathed alike, be∣cause it will perhaps neither suit their Bodies nor their Estates. And if a Man be cloathed <HI>soberly,</HI> and without <HI>Superfluity,</HI> tho' they may be <HI>finer</HI> than that which his Servant is cloathed with, we shall
<PB N="533" REF="003129_0273_0FF00675932A43E8"/>
not blame him for it: The abstaining from Super∣fluities, which his Condition and Education have accustomed him to, may be in him a greater Act of Mortification, than the abstaining from finer Cloaths in the Servant, who was never accustom∣ed to them. As to the Country, what it naturally produces, may be no Vanity to the Inhabitants to use, or what is commonly imparted to them by way of Exchange; seeing it is without doubt, that the Creation is for the use of Man. So where Silk abounds, it may be worn, as well as Wool; and were we in those Countries, or near unto them, where <HI>Gold</HI> or <HI>Silver</HI> were as common as <HI>Iron</HI> or <HI>Brass,</HI> the one might be used as well as the other. The Iniquity then lies here, <HI>First,</HI> When from a lust of Vanity, and desire to Adorn themselves, Men and Women, not content with what their Condition can bear, or their Country easily affords, do stretch to have things, that from their Rarity, and the Price that's put upon them, seem to be precious; and so feed their Lust the more: And this all sober Men of all sorts will readily grant to be Evil.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>; When Men are not content to make a true use of the Creation, whether the things be <HI>fine</HI> or <HI>course,</HI> and do not satisfie themselves with what Need and Conveniency call for; but add thereunto things meerly <HI>superfluous</HI>; such as is the use of <HI>Ribbands</HI> and <HI>Lace,</HI> and much more of that kind of stuff, as <HI>painting the Face, plaiting the Hair,</HI> which are the Fruits of the <HI>first, lustful</HI> and <HI>corrupt Nature,</HI> and not of the <HI>new Creation,</HI> as all will acknowledge. And tho' sober Men, among all sorts, will say, That it were better these things were not; yet will they not reckon them unlaw∣ful, and therefore do admit the use of them among their Church-Members. But we do account them altogether unlawful, and unsuitable to Christians, and that for these Reasons.</P>
<PB N="534" REF="003129_0274_0FF0067733326260"/>
<P>First; <HI>The use of Cloaths came originally from the Fall</HI>· If Man had not fallen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The proper Use of Cloaths.</NOTE> it appear he would not have needed them. But this miserable State made them necessary in two respects: 1. <HI>To cover his Nakedness.</HI> 2. <HI>To keep them from the Cold</HI>; which are both the proper and principal Use of them. Now for Man to delight himself in that, which is the fruit of his Iniquity, and the consequence of Sin, can be no ways lawful for him: So to extend things be∣yond their real use, or to superadd things wholly superfluous, is a manifest Abuse of the Creation, and therefore not lawful to Christians.</P>
<P>Secondly; Those that will needs so adorn them∣selves in the use of their Cloaths, as to beset them with things having no real use or necessity, but meerly for Ornament's sake, do openly declare, That the End of it is either to please their <HI>Lust,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Not to please their Lusts.</NOTE> (for which end these things are chiefly invented and contrived or otherwise to gratifie a <HI>vain, proud and ostentatious Mind</HI>; and it is obvious, these are their general Ends in so doing. Yea, we see, how easily Men are puff'd up with their Garments, and how proud and vain they are, when adorned to their Mind. Now how far these things are below a true Christian, and how unsuitable, it needs not great probation. Hereby those that love to be <HI>gaudy</HI> and <HI>superfluous</HI> in their Cloaths, shew they concern themselves little with Mortification and Self denial, and that they mind to beautify their Bodies more than their Souls; which prove their Minds are little upon Mortality, and so certainly are more nominal, than real Christians.</P>
<P>Thirdly; The Scripture severely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such Practices, both commending and commanding the contrary;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Contrary to Scripture.</NOTE> as <HI>Isa.</HI> 3. how severely doth the Pro∣phet reprove the Daughters of <HI>Israel</HI> for their <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kling Ornaments,</HI> their <HI>Cauls,</HI> and their <HI>round Tires</HI> their <HI>Chains</HI> and <HI>bracelets,</HI> &amp;c? And yet is it not strange to see Christians allow themselves
<PB N="535" REF="003129_0274_0FF0067733326260"/>
in these things, from whom a more strict and ex∣emplary Conversation is required? Christ desires us not to be <HI>anxious</HI> about our Cloathing, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.25. and to shew the Vanity of such, as glory in the Splendor of their Cloathing, tells them, <HI>That even</HI> Solomon, <HI>in all his Glory, was not to be compared to the Lilly of the Field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the Oven.</HI> But surely, they make small reckoning of Christ's Words and Doctrine, that are so curious in their Cloathing, and so industri∣ous to deck themselves, and so earnest to justifie it, and so mad when they are reproved for it. The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> is very positive in this respect, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.8, 9, 10. <HI>I will therefore in like manner also, that Women adorn themselves in modest Apparel, with shame-facedness and sobriety; not with broidered Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or costly Arr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y: But (which becometh Women professing Godliness) with good Works.</HI> To the same purpose saith <HI>Peter,</HI> (1 Pet. 3.3, 4.) <HI>Whose a∣dorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the Hair, and wearing of Gold, or of putting on of Apparel: But</HI> let it be <HI>the hidden Man of the Heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. Here both the Apostles do very positively and expresly assert two things, <HI>First,</HI> That the adorning of <HI>Christian Women</HI> (of whom it is particularly spoken, judge, because that Sex is most naturally inclined to that Vanity; and that it seems, that <HI>Christian Men</HI> in those days deserved not, in this respect, so much to be re∣proved) ought not to be outward, nor consist in the Apparel. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That they ought not to use <HI>Plaiting of the Hair,</HI> or <HI>Ornaments,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plaiting the Hair, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> &amp;c. which was at that time the Custom of the Nations. But is it not strange, that such as make the Scripture their Rule, and pretend they are guided by it, should not only be so frequently and ordinarily in the use of these things, which the Scripture so plainly condemns; but also should allow them∣selves

in so doing? For the Apostles not only com∣mend the Forbearance of these things, as an At∣tainment commendable in Christians, but condemn the use of them as unlawful; and yet may it not seem more strange, that in Contradiction to the Apostles Doctrine, as if they had resolved to slight their Testimony, they should condemn those, that out of Conscience, apply themselves seriously to fol∣low it, as if in so doing they were <HI>singular, proud,</HI> or <HI>superstitious?</HI> This certainly betokens a sad Apo∣stasie in those, that will be accounted Christians, that they are so offended with those, that love to follow Christ and his Apostles, in denying of, and departing from the lying Vanities of this perishing World; and so doth much evidence their Affinity with such, as <HI>hate to be reproved,</HI> and <HI>neither will enter themselves, nor suffer those that would.</HI></P>
<P N="8">§. VIII. <HI>Fourthly</HI>; Let us consider the use of <HI>Games, Sports,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sports</HI> &amp;c. inconsistent with the Gospel.</NOTE> <HI>Comedies,</HI> and other such things, commonly and indifferently used by all the several sorts of Christians, under the Notion of <HI>Divertisement</HI> and <HI>Recreation,</HI> and see whether these things can consist with the Seriousness, Gravity and Godly Fear, which the Gospel calls for. Let us but view, and look over the Notions of them, that call themselves Christians, whether Papists or Protestants, and see if generally there be any difference, save in meer Name and Profession, from the Heathen? Doth not the same <HI>Folly,</HI> the same <HI>Vanity,</HI> the same <HI>Abuse</HI> of <HI>precious</HI> and <HI>irrevokable Time,</HI> abound? The same Gaming, Sporting, Playing, &amp; from thence Quarrel∣ing, Fighting, Swearing, Ranting, Revelling? Now, how can these things be remedied, so long as the Preachers and Professors, and those who are the Leaders of the People, do allow these things, and account them not inconsistent with the Profession of Christianity? And it is strange to see, that these things are tolerated every where; the Inquisition lays no hold on them, neither at <HI>Rome,</HI> nor in <HI>Spain,</HI>

where, in their <HI>Masq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erades,</HI> all manner of Obscenity, Folly, yea, and Atheism, is generally practised in the face of the World, to the great Scandal of the Christian Name: But if any Man reprove them in these things, and forsake their Superstitions, and come seriously to <HI>serve God,</HI> and <HI>Worship him in the Spirit,</HI> he is made a Prey, and presently made liable to cruel Sufferings. Doth this bear any proportion to Christianity? Do these things look any thing like the Churches of the Primitive Christians? Surely not at all. I shall first cite some few <HI>Scripture Testimonies,</HI> being very positive Precepts to Christians, and then see, whether such as obey them, can admit of these fore mentioned things. The Apostle commands us, That <HI>whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we do it all to the Glory of God.</HI> But I judge none will be so impudent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">By Sports and Games God is not glorified?</NOTE> as to affirm, That in the use of these <HI>Sports</HI> and <HI>Games</HI> God is glorified: If any should so say, they would declare, they neither knew God, nor his Glory. And Experience abundantly proves, that in the Practice of these things, Men mind nothing less, than the Glory of God; and nothing more, than the Satisfaction of their own <HI>carnal Lusts, Wills</HI> and <HI>Appetites.</HI> The Apostle desires us, 1 Cor. 7.29, 31. <HI>Because the time is short, that they that buy, should be as tho' they possessed not: And they that use this World, as not abusing it,</HI> &amp;c. But how can they be found in the Obedience of this Precept, that plead for the use of these Games and Sports? Who, it seems, think the time so long, that they cannot find oc∣casion enough to employ it, neither in taking care for their Souls, nor yet in the necessary care for their Bodies; but invent these Games and Sports to pass it away, as if they wanted other Work to serve God, or be useful to the Creation in. The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> desires us, <HI>To pass the time of our so∣journing here in fear,</HI> 1 Pet. 1.17. But will any say, That such as use <HI>Dancing</HI> and <HI>Comedies, Carding</HI> and

<HI>Dicing,</HI> do so much as mind this Precept in the use of these things? Where there is nothing to be seen, but <HI>Lightness</HI> and <HI>Vanity, Wantonness</HI> and <HI>Obscenity</HI> contrived, to hinder Men from <HI>Fear,</HI> or being <HI>Se∣rious</HI>; and therefore, no doubt, calculated for the Service of the Devil. There is no Duty more fre∣quently commanded, nor more incumbent upon Christians, than the <HI>Fear of the Lord,</HI> to <HI>stand in awe before him,</HI> to <HI>walk as in his presence</HI>; but if such, as use these Games and Sports, will speak from their Consciences, they can, (I doubt not) experi∣mentally declare, That this <HI>Fear</HI> is forgotten in their Gaming: And if God by his <HI>Light</HI> secretly touch them, or mind them of the <HI>Vanity</HI> of their way, they strive to shut it out, and use their Ga∣ming, as an Engine to put away from them that troublesome Guest; and thus <HI>make merry over the Just One, whom they have slain and crucified in them∣selves.</HI> But further, if Christ's Reasoning be to be heeded, who saith, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.35, 36. That <HI>the good Man, out of the good Treasure of the Heart, bringeth forth good things; and an evil Man, out of the evil Treasure, bringeth forth evil things</HI>; And that <HI>of every idle word</HI> we <HI>shall give an account in the Day of Judg∣ment</HI>: It may be easily gathered, from what <HI>Trea∣sure</HI> these Inventions come; and it may be easily proved, that it is from the <HI>Evil,</HI> and not the <HI>Good.</HI> How many <HI>idle Words</HI> do they necessarily produce?<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Comedies, a</HI> studied complex of idle lying Words.</NOTE> Yea, what are <HI>Comedies</HI> but a <HI>studied Complex of idle and lying Words?</HI> Let Men, that believe their <HI>Souls</HI> are <HI>Immortal,</HI> and that there will be a <HI>Day of Judg∣ment,</HI> in which these Words of Christ will be ac∣complished, answer me, how all these will make account in that <HI>great</HI> and <HI>terrible Day,</HI> of all these <HI>idle Words,</HI> that are necessarily made use of, about <HI>Dancing, Gaming, Carding,</HI> and <HI>Comedies acting?</HI> And yet how is it that, by Christians not condemning these things, but allowing of them, many that are accounted <HI>Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> take up their whole Time in

them; yea, make it their Trade and Employment? Such as the <HI>Dancing-Masters</HI> and <HI>Comedians,</HI> &amp;c. whose Hellish Conversations do sufficiently declare, what Master they serve, and to what End these things contribute. And it cannot be denied, as being obviously manifest by Experience, that such as are Masters of these Trades, and are most de∣lighted in them, (if they be not open <HI>Atheists</HI> and <HI>Profligates</HI>) are such, at best, as make Religion, or the Care of their Souls, their least business. Now if these things were discountenanced by <HI>Christians,</HI> as inconsistent with their Profession, it would re∣move these things; for these <HI>Wretches</HI> would be necessitated then to betake themselves to some honest Livelyhood, if they were not fed and up∣holden by these. And as hereby, a great Scan∣dal and Stumbling-block would be removed from off the <HI>Christian Name</HI>; so also would that in part be taken out of the way, which provokes the Lord to with hold his <HI>Blessing,</HI> and by occasion of which things the Minds of many remain chain∣ed in <HI>Darkness,</HI> and drowned in <HI>Lust, Sensuality</HI> and <HI>Worldly Pleasures,</HI> without any sense of God's Fear, or their own Souls Salvation. Many of those, call∣ed <HI>Fathers of the Church,</HI> and other Serious Per∣sons, have signified their Regret for these things, and their desires they might be remedied; of whom many Citations might be alledged, which for Bre∣vity's sake I have omitted.</P>

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; Tho' all this were granted, it would no ways militate against us, neither plead the use of these things, which we would have wholly laid aside. For that Men should be always in the same

Now the necessary Occasions, which all are involved into, in order to the care and sustentation of the outward Man, are a Relaxation of the Mind from the more serious Duties; and those are performed in the Bles∣sing; as the Mind is so leavened with the Love of God, and Sense of his Presence, that even in doing these things, the Soul carryeth with it that <HI>Divine Influence</HI> &amp; <HI>Spiritual Habit,</HI> whereby, tho' these Acts as of <HI>Eating, Drinking, Sleeping, Working,</HI> be upon the matter one with what the Wicked do, yet they are done in another Spirit, and in doing of them we please the Lord, serve him, and answer our end in the Creation, and so feel, and are sensible of his <HI>Blessing</HI>: Whereas the Wicked and Profane, being not come to this place, are, in whatsoever they do, <HI>cursed</HI>; and their <HI>Plowing,</HI> as well as <HI>Praying, is sin.</HI> Now if any will plead, that for Relaxation of Mind there may be a Liberty allowed beyond these things, which are of absolute need to the Sustenance of the outward Man, I shall not much <HI>contend</HI> against it; provided these things be not such as are wholly Superfluous, or in their proper nature and ten∣dency, lead the Mind into <HI>Lust, Vanity</HI> and <HI>Wanton∣ness,</HI> as being chiefly contrived and framed for that end, or generally experienced to produce these Ef∣fects, or being the common Engines of such, as are so minded to feed one another therein, and to pro∣pagate their Wickedness, to the Impoysoning of others: Seeing there are other innocent Divertise∣ments, which may sufficiently serve for Relaxation of the Mind; such as for <HI>Friends to visit one another,

To hear or read History, To speak soberly of the present or past Transactions, To follow after Gardening,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lawful Di∣vertise∣ments.</NOTE> <HI>To use Geometrical and Mathematical Experiments,</HI> and such other things of this Nature. In all which things we are not to forget God, (<HI>in whom we both live, and are moved,</HI> Acts 10.26.) as not to have always some <HI>secret reserve</HI> to him, and sense of his Fear and Presence; which also frequently exerts it self in the midst of these things, by some short Aspiration and Breathings. And that this may neither seem <HI>strange</HI> nor <HI>troublesom,</HI> I shall clear it by one manifest In∣stance, answerable to the Experience of all Men. It will not be denied, but that Men ought to be more in the Love of God, than of any other thing; for we ought to <HI>Love God above all things.</HI> Now it is plain, that Men that are taken with Love, whe∣ther it be of Women, or any other thing, if it hath taken a deep place in the Heart, and possess the Mind, it will be hard for the Man, so in love, to drive out of his Mind the person or thing so loved; yea, in his Eating, Drinking and Sleeping, his Mind will always have a tendency that way; and in Business or Recreations, however intent he be in it, there will but a very short time be permitted to pass, but the Mind will let some Ejaculation forth towards its Beloved. And albeit such a one must be conversant in those things,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Love towards its Beloved shuns its Offence.</NOTE> that the Care of this Body, and such like things call for; yet will he avoid, as Death it self, to do those things, that may offend the Party so beloved, or cross his de∣sign in obtaining the thing so earnestly desired: Tho' there may be some small use in them; the great Design, which is chiefly in his Eye, will so ballance him, that he will easily look over and dis∣pence with such petty Necessities, rather than en∣danger the loss of the greater by them. Now that Men ought to be thus <HI>in Love with God,</HI> and the <HI>Life to come,</HI> none will deny; and the thing is ap∣parent from these Scriptures, <HI>Mat.</HI> 6.20. <HI>But lay

<P>And again, That these <HI>Games, Sports, Plays, Dan∣cing Comedies,</HI> &amp;c. do naturally tend to draw Men from God's Fear, to make them forget Heaven, Death and Judgment, to foster Lust, Vanity and Wantonness; and therefore are most <HI>loved,</HI> as well as <HI>used,</HI> by such kind of Persons, Experience abun∣dantly shews; and the most Serious and Conscien∣tious among all will scarcely deny: Which if it be so, the Application is easie.</P>
<P N="10">§. X. <HI>Fifthly</HI>; The use of <HI>Swearing</HI> is to be consi∣dered, which is so frequently practised almost among all Christians; not only <HI>profane Oaths</HI> among the <HI>Pro∣fane,</HI> in their common Discourses, whereby the <HI>Most HOLY NAME of GOD</HI> is, in a horrible manner, daily Blasphemed; but also <HI>solemn Oaths,</HI> with those that have some shew of <HI>Piety,</HI> whereof the most part do defend Swearing before the Magi∣strate with so great Zeal, that not only they are ready themselves to do it upon every occasion, but also have stirred up the Magistrates to persecute those, who, out of Obedience to Christ, their Lord and Master, judge it unlawful to Swear: Upon which account not a few have suffered Imprisonment, and the spoiling of their Goods.</P>
<P>But considering these clear words of our Savi∣our,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Swear∣ing is for∣bidden —</NOTE> <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.33, 34. <HI>Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not for∣swear thy self, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine Oaths. But I say unto you,</HI> SWEAR NOT AT ALL, <HI>neither by Heaven,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>But let your Communication be Yea, Yea; Nay, Nay: For whatsoever is more than these, cometh of evil.</HI> As also the words of the Apo∣stle <HI>James</HI> 5.12. <HI>But above all things, my Brethren, Swear not, neither by Heaven, neither by the Earth, nei∣ther
<PB N="543" REF="003129_0278_0FF00680B31ED678"/>
by any other Oath: But let your Yea, be Yea, and your Nay, Nay; lest ye fall into Condemnation.</HI> I say, considering these clear words, it is admirable how any one, that professeth the Name of Christ, can pronounce any Oath with a quiet Conscience; far less to persecute other Christians, that dare not Swear, because of their Master Christ his Authority. For did any one purpose seriously, and in the most rigid manner, to forbid any thing, comprehended under any General, can they use a more full and general Prohibition, and that without any Excep∣tion? I think not. For Christ, <HI>First,</HI> proposeth it to us Negatively, <HI>Swear not at all, neither by Hea∣ven, nor by the Earth, nor by</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>nor by thy Head,</HI> &amp;c. And again, <HI>Swear not by Heaven, nor by Earth, nor by any other Oath. Secondly,</HI> he presseth it Affirmatively, <HI>But let your Communication be Yea, Yea; and Nay, Nay: For whatsoever is more than these, cometh of evil.</HI> And saith <HI>James, Lest ye fall into Con∣demnation.</HI></P>
<P>Which words, both all and every one of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Without Exception.</NOTE> do make such a full Prohibition, and so free of all Exception, that it is strange how Men, that boast the Scripture is the Rule of their <HI>Faith and Life,</HI> can counterfeit any Exception! Certainly <HI>Reason</HI> ought to teach every one, that it is not lawful to make void a general Prohibition, coming from God, by such opposition; unless the Exception be as clearly and evidently expressed, as the Prohibition: Nei∣ther is it enough, to endeavour to confirm it by Consequences and Probabilites, which are obscure and uncertain, and not sufficient to bring quiet to the Conscience. For if they say, that there is there∣fore an Exception and Limitation in the words, because there are found Exceptions in the other general Prohibition of this fifth Chapter, as in the forbidding of Divorcement, where Christ saith, <HI>It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his Wife, let him give her a Writing of Divorcement. But I say
<PB N="544" REF="003129_0279_0FF0068372966C98"/>
unto you, That whosoever shall put away his Wife saving for the cause of Fornication, causeth her to commit Adul∣tery:</HI> If (I say) they plead this, they not only labour in vain, but also fight against themselves, because they can produce no Exception of this general Command of <HI>not Swearing,</HI> expressed by God to any under the New Covenant, after Christ give this Prohibition, so clear as that, which is made in the Prohibition it self. Moreover, if Christ would have excepted Oaths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Also Oaths before a Magistrate</NOTE> made before Magistrates, certainly he had then expressed, adding, <HI>Except in Judgment, before the Migistrate,</HI> or the like; as he did in that of Divorcement, by these words, <HI>Saving for the cause of Fornication</HI>: Which being so, it is not lawful for us to <HI>except</HI> or <HI>distinguish,</HI> or (which is all one) <HI>make void</HI> this general Prohibition of Christ; it would be far less agreeable to Christian Holiness, to bring upon our Heads the Crimes of so many Oaths, which by reason of this Corruption and Exception, are so frequent among Christians.</P>
<P>Neither is it to be omitted, that without doubt, the most Learned Doctors of each Sect know, that these fore mentioned words were understood by the Ancient Fathers of the <HI>first Three Hundred Years</HI> after Christ, to be a Prohibition of all sorts of Oaths. It is not then without Reason, that we wonder,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Concur∣rence of the Ancient Fathers therein.</NOTE> that the Popish Doctors and Priests, bind themselves by an Oath, to interpret the Holy Scrip∣tures according to the universal Exposition of the Holy Fathers; who notwithstanding understood those Controverted Texts quite contrary to what these modern Doctors do. And from thence also do clearly appear, the vanity and foolish certainty (so to speak) of Popish Tradition; for if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the Wri∣tings of the Fathers, so called, the Faith of the Church of these Ages may be demonstrated, it is clear, they have departed from the Faith of the Church of the <HI>first Three Ages</HI> in the point of Swearing. Moreover, because not only <HI>Papists,</HI> but
<PB N="545" REF="003129_0279_0FF0068372966C98"/>
also <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>therans</HI> and <HI>Calvinists</HI> and some others, do restrict the words of <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>James,</HI> I think it needful, to make manifest the vain Foundation, upon which their Presumption in this matter is built.</P>
<P N="11"><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> §. XI. <HI>First,</HI> They Object, <HI>That Christ only forbids those Oaths, that are made by Creatures, and things Created</HI>; and they prove it thence, because he num∣bers some of these things.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>All rash and vain Oaths in familiar Dis∣courses; because he saith, Let your Communication be Yea, Yea; and Nay, Nay.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Ans."

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Ans." N="2"/> <HI>Secondly</HI>; It is most evident, that Christ forbids somewhat that was permitted under the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To Swear by God him∣self, for∣bidden by Christ.</NOTE> to wit, to <HI>swear by the Name of God</HI>; because it was not lawful for any Man to swear but by God himself. And because he saith, <HI>Neither by Heaven, because it is the Throne of God</HI>; therefore he excludes all other <HI>Oaths,</HI> even those which are made by God: For he saith. <HI>Chap.</HI> 23. <HI>v.</HI> 22. <HI>He that shall swear by Heaven, sweareth by the Throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon.</HI> Which is also to be understood of the rest.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ans.</HI> 3.</NOTE></P>

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; They are indeed One, and cannot contradict one another: Nevertheless the Father gave many things to the Jews for a time, because of their Infirmity under the old Covenant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aths un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the Old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ovenant.</NOTE> which had only a Shadow of good things to come, not the very Substance of things, until Christ should come, who was the Substance; and by whose com∣ing all these things vanished, to wit, <HI>Sabbaths, Cir∣cumcision,</HI> the <HI>Paschal Lamb:</HI> Men used then Sacri∣fices, who lived in Controversies with God, and one with another, which all are abrogated in the coming of the Son, who is the Substance, Eternal Word, and Essential Oath and Amen, in whom the <HI>Promises of God are Yea and Amen</HI>: Who came, that Men might be Redeemed out of Strife, and might make an end of Controversie.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>Thirdly,</HI> They object: <HI>But all Oaths are not Cere∣monies, nor any part of the Ceremonial Law.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; Except it be shewn to be an Eternal, Immutable and Moral Precept,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tithes</HI> &amp;c. unlawful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w.</NOTE> it withstands not; neither are they of so old an Origin as <HI>Tithes,</HI> and the offering of the first Fruits of the Ground, which by <HI>Abel</HI> and <HI>Cain</HI> were offered, long before the Ceremonial Law, or the use of Oaths; which, whatever may be alledged against it, were no doubt Ceremonies, and therefore no doubt unlawful now to be practised.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>Fourthly,</HI> They object; <HI>That to swear by the Name of God, is a</HI> Moral Precept, <HI>of continual duration; be∣cause it is marked with his Essential and</HI> Moral Worship, Deut. 6.13. and 10.20. <HI>Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him alone: Thou shalt cleave to him, and swear by his Name.</HI></P>

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>Fifthly</HI>; They object; <HI>That solemn Oaths, which God commanded, cannot be here forbidden by Christ; for he saith, That they come from evil: But these did not come from evil; for God never commanded any thing that was evil, or came from evil.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; There are things which are <HI>Good,</HI> because <HI>commanded</HI>; and <HI>Evil,</HI> because <HI>forbidden</HI>: Other things are <HI>commanded,</HI> because <HI>Good</HI>; and <HI>forbidden,</HI> because <HI>Evil.</HI> As <HI>Circumcision</HI> and <HI>Oaths,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oaths are Evils, be∣cause for∣bidden.</NOTE> which were <HI>good,</HI> when and because they were <HI>commanded,</HI> and in no other respect; and again, when and because prohibited under the Gospel, they are <HI>evil.</HI></P>
<P>And in all these Jewish Constitutions, however Ceremonial, there was something of <HI>good,</HI> to wit, in their season, as prefiguring some Good: As by <HI>Circumcision,</HI> the <HI>Purifications,</HI> and other things, the Holiness of God was typified, and that the <HI>Isra∣elites</HI> ought to be <HI>Holy, as their God was Holy.</HI> In the like manner <HI>Oaths,</HI> under the Shadows and Cere∣monies, signified the <HI>Verity of God,</HI> his Faithfulness and Certainty; and therefore, that we ought in all things to speak and witness the Truth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Truth was before all Oaths.</NOTE> But the <HI>Witness of Truth</HI> was before all <HI>Oaths,</HI> and remains, when all Oaths are abolished; and this is the mo∣rality of all Oaths, and so long as Men abide there∣in, there is no necessity of, nor place for Oaths; as <HI>Polybius</HI> witnessed, who said, <HI>The Use of</HI> Oaths <HI>in Judgment was rare among the Ancients; but by the growing of</HI> Perfidiousness, <HI>so grew also the use of</HI> Oaths.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer with <HI>Athanasius; Seeing it is certain, it is proper in swearing to swear by another; thence it ap∣pears, that God, to speak properly, did never swear,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Athan in</HI> pass. &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rue Domin.</NOTE> <HI>but</HI> only <HI>improperly. Whence speaking to Men, he is said to swear; because those things which he speaks, because of the certainty and immutability of his Will, are to be esteemed for</HI> Oaths. Compare <HI>Psalm</HI> 110.4. where it is said, <HI>The Lord did swear, and it did not repent him,</HI> &amp;c. And <HI>I swore</HI> (saith he) <HI>by my self: And this is not an</HI> Oath.<NOTE PLACE="marg">God swear∣eth not by another, but by him∣self.</NOTE> <HI>For he did not swear by another, which is the property of an</HI> Oath, <HI>but by himself. Therefore God swears not according to the manner of Men, neither can we be induced from thence to swear; but let us so do and say, and shew our selves such by speaking and acting, that we need not with our</HI> Hearers <HI>an</HI> Oath, <HI>and let our Words of themselves have the Testimony of Truth: For so we shall plainly imitate God.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>Seventhly,</HI> They object; <HI>Christ did swear, and we ought to imitate him.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer, That Christ did not swear; and albeit he had sworn, being yet under the Law, this would no ways oblige us under the Gospel; as neither Circumcision, or the Celebration of the Pas∣chal Lamb.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>Eightly,</HI> They object; <HI>That</HI> Paul <HI>swore, and that often,</HI> Rom. 1.9.

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> To all which I answer, <HI>First</HI>; That the using of such forms of speaking are neither Oaths, nor so esteemed by our Adversaries. For when upon oc∣casion, in matters of great moment, we have said, <HI>We speak the Truth in the Fear of God, and before him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cere∣monies of an Oath.</NOTE> <HI>who is our Witness, and the searcher of our Hearts,</HI> adding such kind of serious Attestations, which we never refused in matters of Consequence; nevertheless an Oath hath moreover been requi∣red of us with the Ceremony of putting our Hands upon the Book, the kissing of it, the lifting up of the Hand or Fingers, together with this common form of Imprecation, <HI>So help me God</HI>; or, <HI>Let the Lord God Almighty help me. Secondly,</HI> This contradicts the Opinion of our Adversaries, be∣cause that <HI>Paul</HI> was neither before a Magistrate, that was requiring an Oath of him; nor did he himself administer the Office of a Magistrate, as offering an Oath to any other. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Que∣stion is not, what <HI>Paul</HI> or <HI>Peter</HI> did, but what their and our Master ought to be done; and if <HI>Paul</HI> did swear, (which we believe not) he had sinned against the Command of Christ, even ac∣cording to their own Opinion; because he swore not before a Magistrate, but in an Epistle to his Brethren.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>Ninthly,</HI> They object, <HI>Isai.</HI> 65.16. where, speak∣ing of the Evangelical Times, he saith, <HI>That he who blesseth himself in the Earth, shall bless himself in the God of Truth; and he that sweareth in the Earth, shall swear by the God of Truth: Because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mens Eyes. For behold, I create new Heavens,
<PB N="551" REF="003129_0282_0FF00689C8C8E2D8"/>
and a new Earth: Therefore in these times we ought to swear by the Name of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; It is ordinary for the Prophets to express the greatest Duties of <HI>Evangelical Times</HI> in <HI>Mosaical Terms,</HI> as appears among others from <HI>Jer.</HI> 31.38, 39, 40. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 36.25, &amp; 40. and <HI>Isa.</HI> 45.23. <HI>I have sworn by my self, that unto me every Knee shall bow, every Tongue shall swear.</HI> Where the Righteousness of the <HI>New Jerusalem,</HI> the Purity of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> with <HI>spiritual Worship,</HI> and the Pro∣fession of the <HI>Name of Christ,</HI> are expressed under forms of speaking used to the <HI>Old Jerusalem,</HI> un∣der the Washings of the Law, under the Names of Ceremonies, the Temple, Services, Sacrifices,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Swearing</HI> is expressed by <HI>Confes∣sing</HI> under the Gospel.</NOTE> Oaths, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Yea, that which the Prophet speaks here of <HI>Swearing,</HI> the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> interprets it expresly of <HI>Confessing,</HI> saying, <HI>Rom.</HI> 14.11. <HI>For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every Knee shall bow to me, and every Tongue shall confess to God:</HI> Which being rightly considered, none can be ig∣norant, but these words, which the Prophet writes under the Law, when the Ceremonial Oaths were in use, to wit, <HI>Every Tongue shall swear,</HI> were by the Apostle, being under the Gospel, when those Oaths became abolished, expressed by, <HI>Every Tongue shall confess.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>Tenthly</HI>; They object; <HI>But the Apostle</HI> Paul <HI>ap∣proves</HI> Oaths used among Men, <HI>when he writes,</HI> Heb. 6.16. <HI>For Men verily swear by the greater, and an</HI> Oath <HI>for confirmation, is to them an end of all strife. But there are as many Contests, Fallacies &amp; Differences at this time, as there were ever: Therefore the</HI> neces∣sity of Oaths <HI>doth yet remain.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; The Apostle tells indeed in this place, what Men at that time did, who lived in Con∣troversies and Incredulity; not what they ought to have done, nor what the Saints did, who were Redeemed from Strife and Incredulity, and
<PB N="552" REF="003129_0283_0FF0068DC70D6798"/>
had come to Christ, the Truth and Amen of God. Moreover, he only alludes to a certain Custom usual among Men, that he might express the Fir∣mity of the Divine Promise, that he might excite in the Saints so much the more confidence in God, promising to them, not that he might instigate them to <HI>swear</HI> against the Law of God, or con∣firm them in that; no, not at all: For neither doth 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.24. teach Christians the vain Races, whereby Men often-times, even to the destruction of their Bodies, are wearied to obtain a Corrup∣tible Prize; So neither doth Christ, who is the <HI>Prince of Peace,</HI> teach his Disciples to Fight, al∣beit he takes notice, <HI>Luke</HI> 14.31. what it be∣hoveth such Kings to do, who are accustomed to Fight, as prudent Warriors therein. <HI>Secondly,</HI> as to what pertains to <HI>Contest, Perfidies</HI> and <HI>Diffi∣dences</HI> among Men, which our Adversaries affirm to have grown to such an height, that Swearing is at present as necessary as ever. That we deny not at all; for we see, and daily Experience teacheth us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deceit a∣mong the False, not the True Christians.</NOTE> that all manner of Deceit and Malice doth increase among worldly Men and false Christians; but not among true Christians. But because Men cannot trust one another, and therefore require Oaths one of another, it will not therefore fol∣low, that true Christians ought to do so, whom Christ has brought to true Faithfulness and Ho∣nesty, as well towards God, as one towards ano∣ther, and therefore has delivered them from Con∣tests, Perfidies, and consequently from Oaths.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>Eleventhly,</HI> They object; <HI>We grant, that among</HI> true Christians, <HI>there is not need of</HI> Oaths; <HI>but by what means shall we infallibly know them? It will fol∣low then, that</HI> Oaths <HI>are at present needful, and that it is lawful for Christians to swear, to wit, that such may be sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied, who will not acknowledge this and the other Man to be a Christian.</HI></P>
<PB N="553" REF="003129_0283_0FF0068DC70D6798"/>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; It is no ways lawful for a Christian to swear, whom Christ hath called to his Essen∣tial Truth, which was before all Oaths,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Truth was before Oaths.</NOTE> forbid¦ding him to swear; and on the contrary, com∣manding him to speak the Truth in all things, to the Honour of Christ, who called him; that it may appear, that the Words of his Disciples may be as truly believed, as the Oaths of all the Worldly Men. Neither is it lawful for them to be unfaithful in this, that they may please others, for that they may avoid their hurt: For thus the Primitive Christians for some Ages remained faithful, who being required to swear, did una∣nimously answer, <HI>I am a Christian, I swear not.</HI> What shall I say of the Heathens, some of whom arrived to that degree? For <HI>Tiodorus Siculus</HI> re∣lates, lib. 16. That <HI>the giving of the right Hand, was, among the</HI> Persians, <HI>a sign of speaking the Truth.</HI> And the <HI>Scythians,</HI> as <HI>Qu. Curtius</HI> relates, said, in their Conferences with <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, <HI>Think not that the</HI> Schythians <HI>confirm their Friendship by swearing; they swear by keeping their Promises. Stobaeus</HI> in his third Sermon tells, That <HI>Solon</HI> said, <HI>A good Man ought to be in that esti∣mation, that he</HI> need not an Oath; <HI>because it is to be reputed a lessening of his Honour if he be forced to swear. Pythogoras,</HI> in his Oration,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heathen</HI> Testimonies against Oath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> among other things hath this Maxim, as that which concerns the Administration of the Common-wealth: <HI>Let no Man call God to witness by an</HI> Oath, <HI>no not in Judgment; but let every Man so accustom himself to speak, that he may become worthy to be trusted even</HI> without an Oath. <HI>Basil</HI> the Great, commends <HI>Cli∣nias</HI> an Heathen, <HI>That he had rather pay three Ta∣lents, which are about three thousand Pound, than swear. Socrates,</HI> as <HI>Stobaeus</HI> relates, Serm. 14. had this Sentence, <HI>The Duty of good Men requires, that they shew to the World, that their Manners and
<PB N="554" REF="003129_0284_0FF0068FCB0D25B8"/>
Actions are more firm than Oaths</HI>: The same was the Judgment of <HI>Isocrates. Plato</HI> also stood against Oaths in his Judgments, <HI>de Leg.</HI> 12. <HI>Quintilianus</HI> takes notice, <HI>That it was of old a kind of Infamy, if any was desired to swear; but to require an</HI> Oath <HI>of a Noble Man, was like an examining him by the Hang man. Marcus Aurelius Antoninus,</HI> the Empe∣ror of <HI>Rome,</HI> saith, in his Discription of a Good Man, <HI>Such is his Integrity, that he needs not an Oath.</HI> So also some Jews did witness, as <HI>Grotius</HI> relates out of <HI>Maimonides, It is best for a Man to abstain from</HI> all Oaths. The <HI>Esseans,</HI> as <HI>Philo Judaeus</HI> re∣lates, <HI>did esteem their</HI> Words <HI>more firm than</HI> Oaths: <HI>and</HI> Oaths <HI>were esteemed among them as needless things.</HI> And <HI>Philo</HI> himself, speaking of the Third Commandment, explains his Mind thus, <HI>viz. It were better altogether not to swear, but to be ac∣customed to speak the Truth, that naked Words might have the strength of an Oath.</HI> And elsewhere he saith, <HI>It is more agreeable to Natural Reason, al∣together to abstain from swearing</HI>; perswading, <HI>That whatsoever a</HI> good Man <HI>saith, may be equivalent with an</HI> Oath.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oaths abro∣gated by Christ.</NOTE>Who then needs further to doubt, but that, since Christ would have his Disciples attain the highest Pitch of Perfection, he abrogated Oaths, as a Rudiment of Infirmity, and in place thereof established the use of Truth?

<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> <HI>Lastly,</HI> They object; <HI>This will bring in Fraud and Confusion; for Impostors will counterfeit Piety, and un∣der the benefit of this Dispensation, will be without fear of punishment.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; There are two things which ob∣lige a Man to speak the Truth: <HI>First,</HI> Either
<PB N="556" REF="003129_0285_0FF0069243B6F550"/>
the Fear of God in his Heart, and love of Truth; for where this is, there is no need of Oaths to speak the Truth:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Punish∣ment of Ly∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs.</NOTE> Or, <HI>Secondly,</HI> The fear of pu∣nishment from the Judge. Therefore let there be the same, or rather greater Punishment ap∣pointed to those, who pretend so great Truth in Words, and so great Simplicity in Heart, that they cannot Lye, and so great Reverence towards the Law of Christ, that for Conscience sake they deny to Swear in any wise, if they fail; and so there shall be the same good Order, yea, greater Security against Deceivers, as if Oaths were con∣tinued; and also by that more severe Punishment, to which these false Dissemblers shall be liable. Hence wicked Men shall be more terrified, and good Men delivered from all Oppression, both in their Liberty and Goods: For which Cause, for their tender Consciences, God hath often a regard to Magistrates and their State, as a thing most acceptable to him. But if any can further doubt of this thing, to wit, if without Confusion it can be practised in the Commonwealth,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> United Nether∣lands <HI>in∣stanced.</HI></NOTE> let him con∣sider the State of the <HI>United Netherlands,</HI> and he shall see the good Effect of it. For there, be∣cause of the great Number of Merchants, more than in any other place, there is most fre∣quent occasion for this thing; and though the number of those, that are of this mind, be con∣siderable, to whom the States these Hundred Years have condescended, and yet daily conde∣scend; yet nevertheless, there has nothing of Prejudice followed thereupon to the Common∣wealth, Government, or Good Order; but ra∣ther great Advantage to Trade, and so to the Commonwealth.</P>

<P>And truly, the words are so clear in them∣selves, that (in my Judgment) they need no il∣lustration to explain their Sense: For it is as easie to reconcile the greatest Contradictions, as these Laws of our Lord Jesus Christ, with the wicked Practices of Wars; for they are plainly in∣consistent. Whoever can reconcile this, <HI>Resist not

Evil</HI> with, <HI>Resist Voilence by Force</HI>; again, <HI>Give also thy other Check,</HI> with, <HI>Strike again</HI>; also, <HI>Love thine Enemies,</HI> with, <HI>Spoil them, make a Prey of them, pur∣sue them with Fire and Sword</HI>; or, <HI>Pray for those that persecute you, and those that calumniate you,</HI> with, <HI>Persecute you by Fines, Imprisonments, &amp; Death it self</HI>; and not only such, as do not <HI>persecute you,</HI> but <HI>who heartily seek and desire your Eternal and Temporal Wel∣fare:</HI> Whoever, I say, can find a Means to reconcile these things, may be supposed also to have found a way to reconcile God with the Devil, Christ with Antichrist. Light with Darkness, and Good with Evil. But if this be impossible, as indeed it is, so will also the other be impossible; and Men do but deceive themselves and others, while they boldly adventure to establish such absurd and im∣possible things.</P>
<P N="14">§. XIV. Nevertheless, because some, perhaps through Inadvertency, and by the force of Custom and Tradition do transgress this Command of Christ, I shall briefly shew, how much War doth contra∣dict this Precept, and how much they are incon∣sistent with one another; and consequently, That <HI>War is no ways lawful to such as will be the Disciples of Christ.</HI> For,</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 5.43.</NOTE>First, Christ commands, That <HI>we should love our Enemies</HI>: But War, on the contrary, teacheth us to hate and destroy them.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Apostle saith, That <HI>we War not after the Flesh</HI> and that <HI>we Fight not with Flesh and Blood:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 6.12.</NOTE> But outward War is according to the Flesh, and against Flesh and Blood; for the shedding of the one, and destroying of the other.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Apostle saith, That <HI>the Weapons of our Warfare are not Carnal but Spiritual:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cor. 10.4.</NOTE> But the Weap is of outward Warfare are Carnal, such as Cannon, Muskets, Spears, Swords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of

which there is no mention in the Armour described by <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, Because <HI>James</HI> testifies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">James 4.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> that <HI>Wars and Strifes come from the Lusts which war in the Members of Carnal Men:</HI> But Christians, that is, those that are truly Saints, <HI>have crucified the Flesh,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. 5.24.</NOTE> <HI>with its Af∣fections and Lusts</HI>: Therefore they cannot indulge them by waging War.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Because the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> and <HI>Micah,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 2.4. Mic. 4.3.</NOTE> have expresly prophesied, That <HI>in the Mountain of the House of the Lord, Christ shall judge the Nati∣ons</HI>; and then <HI>they shall beat their Swords into Plow∣shares,</HI> &amp;c.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Primitive Christians most averse from War.</NOTE> And the Ancient Fathers of the first Three Hundred Years after Christ, did affirm these Prophecies to be fulfilled in the Christians of their Times, who were most averse from <HI>War</HI>; concerning which, <HI>Justin Martyr, Tertullian,</HI> and others, may be seen: Which need not seem strange to any, since <HI>Philo Judaeus</HI> abundantly testifies of the <HI>Essenes,</HI> That <HI>there was none found among them, that would make Instruments of War.</HI> But how much more did Jesus come, <HI>that he might keep his Followers from Fighting, and might bring them to Pa∣tience and Charity?</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly, because the Prophet foretold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 65.26.</NOTE> That <HI>there shall none hurt nor kill in all the Holy Mountain of the Lord</HI>: But outward War is appointed for killing and destroying.</P>
<P>Seventhly, Because Christ said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 18.3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> That <HI>his Kingdom is not of this World,</HI> and therefore that <HI>his Servants shall not fight:</HI> Therefore those that fight are not his Disciples nor Servants.</P>
<P>Eighthly, Because he reproved <HI>Peter</HI> for the use of the Sword, saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 2.52.</NOTE> <HI>Put up again thy Sword into its place: For all they that take the Sword shall perish with the Sword.</HI> Concerning which, <HI>Tertul∣lian</HI> speaks well, lib. de Idol. <HI>How shall he fight in Peace without a sword, which the Lord did take away?

<P>Ninthly, Because the Apostle admonisheth Chri∣stians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 12 19.</NOTE> <HI>That they defend not themselves, neither Re∣venge by rendring evil for evil; but give place unto Wrath, because Vengeance is the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 3.34.</NOTE>Tenthly, Because <HI>Christ calls his Children to bear his Cross, not to crucifie or kill others</HI>; to Patience, not to Revenge; to Truth and Simplicity, not to fraudulent Stratagems of War, or to play the Syco∣phant, which <HI>John</HI> himself forbids; to flee the Glo∣ry of this World, not to acquire it by Warlike En∣deavours: Therefore War is altogether contrary unto the Law and Spirit of Christ.</P>
<P N="15"><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> §. XV. But they object; <HI>That it is lawful to War, because</HI> Abraham <HI>did War before the giving of the Law, and the</HI> Israelites <HI>after the giving of the Law.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer, as before, 1. That <HI>Abraham</HI> offered Sa∣crifices at that time, and Circumcised the Males: Which nevertheless are not lawful for us under the Gospel.</P>

<P N="3">3. That their Wars, against the Wicked Nati∣ons, were a Figure of the Inward W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the true Christians against their Spiritual Enemies, in which we overcome the Devil, the World, and the Flesh.</P>
<PB N="563" REF="003129_0288_0FF00698ADECF158"/>
<P N="4">4. Something is expresly forbidden by Christ, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.26. which was granted to the <HI>Jews</HI> in their time, because of their hardness;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somethings permitted in the Old Testament, because of hardness of Heart.</NOTE> and on the contrary, we are commanded that singular Pati∣ence and exercise of Love, which <HI>Moses</HI> command∣ed not to his Disciples. From whence <HI>Tertul∣lian</HI> saith well against <HI>Marc. Christ truly teacheth a new Patience, even forbidding the Revenging of an Injury, which was permitted by the Creator.</HI> And lib. de patien. <HI>The Law finds more than is lost, by Christ's saying, Love your Enemies.</HI> And in the time of <HI>Clem.

Belge.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> Secondly. They object, <HI>That Defence is of Na∣tural Right, and that Religion destroys not Na∣ture.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer, Be it so; but to obey God, and commend our selves to him in Faith and Pati∣ence, is not to destroy Nature, but to exalt and perfect it; to wit, to elevate it from the Natural to the Supernatural Life, by Christ living therein, and comforting it, that it may do all things, and be rendred more than Con∣queror.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> Thirdly, they object, <HI>That</HI> John <HI>did not abro∣gate or condemn</HI> War, <HI>when the</HI> Soldiers <HI>came unto him.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer. What then? The Question is not concerning <HI>John</HI>'s Doctrine, but Christs, whose Disciples we are, not <HI>John</HI>'s: For Christ, and not <HI>John,</HI> is that Prophet, whom we ought all to hear. And albeit that Christ said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 7.21.28.</NOTE> <HI>That a greater than</HI> John <HI>the Baptist was not among Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orn of

Women</HI>; yet he adds, <HI>That the least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he.</HI> But what was <HI>John</HI>'s answer, that we may see, if it can justifie the Soldiers, of this time? For if it be narrowly minded, it will appear, that what he proposeth to Soldiers, doth manifestly forbid them, that Em∣ployment; for he commands them, <HI>not to do vio∣lence to any Man,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 3.14.</NOTE> <HI>nor to defraud any Man</HI>; but that they <HI>be content with their Wages.</HI> Consider then what he dischargeth to Soldiers, <HI>viz.</HI> Not to use Violence or Deceit against any; which being re∣moved, let any tell how Soldiers can War? For is not Craft, Violence and Injustice, three Proper∣ties of War, and the natural Consequences of Battles?</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> Fourthly, They object, <HI>That</HI> Cornelius, <HI>and that Centurion, of whom there is mention made,</HI> Mat. 8.5. <HI>were Soldiers; and there is no mention, that they laid down their Military Employments.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; Neither read we, that they continu∣ed in them. But it is most probable, that if they continued in the Doctrine of Christ (and we read not any where of their falling from the Faith) that they did not continue in them; especially if we consider, that two or three Ages afterwards, Christians altogether rejected War, or at least a long while after their time, if the Emperor <HI>Marc. Aurel. Anton.</HI> be to be credited, who writes thus: — <HI>I prayed to</HI> my Country Gods; <HI>but when I was neglected by them, and observed my self pressed by the Enemy; considering the fewness of my Forces, I called to one, and intreated those, who with us are called</HI> Christians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christians instanced, that did not War.</NOTE> <HI>and I found a great number of them. And I forced them with Threats, which ought not to have been; because afterwards I knew their strength and force.</HI> Therefore they betook them∣selves neither to the use of Darts nor Trum∣pets, <HI>for they use not so to do, for the</HI> Cause <HI>and</HI> Name of their God, <HI>which they bear in their Con∣sciences</HI>:
<PB N="565" REF="003129_0289_0FF0069AAFD30EA8"/>
And this was done about an Hundred and Sixty Years after Christ. To this add those words, which in <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> the Christians an∣swer, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that is, <HI>We fight not with our Enemies</HI> And moreover the answer of <HI>Martin</HI> to <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate, related by <HI>Sulpitius Severus: I am a</HI> Soldier of Christ, <HI>therefore I cannot fight</HI>; which was Three Hundred Years after Christ. It is not therefore probable, that they continued in Warlike Employments. How then is <HI>Vincentius Lyrinensis,</HI> and the <HI>Papists,</HI> consistent with their Maxim, <HI>That which always, every where, and by all, was received,</HI> &amp;c. And what becomes of the Priests, with their Oath, <HI>That they neither ought, nor will, interpret the</HI> Scripture, <HI>but according to the</HI> Uni∣versal Consent <HI>of the Fathers,</HI> so called? <HI>For it is as easie to obscure the</HI> Sun at Mid-day, <HI>as to deny that the</HI> Primitive Christians <HI>renounced all Revenge and War.</HI></P>
<P>And albeit this thing be so much known to all; yet it is as well known, that all the modern Sects live in the neglect and contempt of this Law of Christ, and likewise oppress others, who in this agree not with them for Conscience sake towards God:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Persecution for not bearing Arms, &amp; not fasting and pray∣ing for Victory.</NOTE> Even as we have suffered much in our Country, because <HI>We neither could our selves bear Arms, nor send others in our place, nor give our Money for the buying of Drums, Standards, and other Military Attire.</HI> And lastly, <HI>Because we could not hold our Doors, Windows and Shops close, for</HI> Consci∣ence sake, <HI>upon such days as Fasts and prayers were appointed, for to desire a Blessing upon, and Success for the Arms of the Kingdom or Commonwealth, under which we live; neither give thanks for the Victories acquired by the effusion of much Blood.</HI> By which forcing of the Conscience, they would have con∣strained our Brethren, living in divers Kingdoms, at War together, to have implored our God for contrary and contradictory things, and conse∣quently
<PB N="566" REF="003129_0290_0FF0069D92CCED60"/>
impossible; for it is impossible, that two Parties fighting together, should both obtain the Victory. And because we cannot concur with them in this Confusion, therefore we are subject to Persecution. Yea, and others, who with us do witness, that the use of Arms is unlawful to Chri∣stians, do look asquint upon us: But which of us two do most faithfully observe this Testimony against Arms? Either they, who at certain times, at the Magistrate's order, do close up their Shops and Houses, and meet in their Assembly, praying for the prosperity of their Arms, or giving thanks for some Victory or other, whereby they make themselves like to those that approve Wars and and Fighting; Or we, which cannot do these things for the same Cause of Conscience, lest we should destroy by our Works, what we establish in Words; We shall leave to the Judgment of all prudent Men.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> Fifthly, They object; <HI>That Christ,</HI> Luke 22.36. <HI>speaking to his Disciples, commands them, That he that then had not a</HI> Sword, <HI>should sell his</HI> Coat, <HI>and buy a</HI> Sword: <HI>Therefore,</HI> say they, <HI>Arms are lawful.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; Some indeed understand this of the outward Sword; nevertheless regarding only that occasion: otherwise judging, that Christians are pro∣hibited Wars under the Gospel. Among which is <HI>Ambrose,</HI> who upon this place speaks thus: <HI>O Lord! Why commandest thou me to buy a Sword, who forbiddest me to smite with it? Why commandest thou me to have it, whom thou prohibitest to draw it? Un∣less perhaps a Defence be prepared, not necessary Re∣venge; and that I may seem to have been able to Re∣venge, but that I would not. For the Law forbids me to smite again; and therefore perhaps he said to</HI> Peter, <HI>offering two Swords,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Peter</HI> offer∣ed two Swords.</NOTE> [It is enough] <HI>as if it had been lawful, until the Gospel times, that in the Law there might be learning of Equity, but in the Gospel a per∣fection of goodness.</HI> Others judge Christ to have
<PB N="567" REF="003129_0290_0FF0069D92CCED60"/>
spoken here mystically, and not according to the Letter; as <HI>Origen</HI> upon <HI>Mat.</HI> 19. saying, <HI>If any looking to the Letter, and not understanding the Will of the Words, shall sell his</HI> bodily Garment, <HI>and buy a</HI> Sword <HI>taking the words of Christ contrary to his will, he shall perish: But concerning which</HI> Sword <HI>he speaks, is not proper here to mention.</HI> And truly, when we consider the answer of the Disciples, <HI>Master, be∣hold, here are two Swords</HI>; understanding it of out∣ward Swords: And again, Christ's answer, <HI>It is enough</HI>; it seems, that Christ would not that the rest, who had not Swords, (for they had only two Swords) should sell their Coats, and buy an out∣ward Sword. Who can think, that matters stand∣ing thus, he should have said, <HI>Two was enough</HI>? But however it is sufficient, that the use of Arms is un∣lawful under the Gospel.</P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Object."/> Sixthly, They object; <HI>That the Scriptures and Old Fathers</HI> (so called) <HI>did only prohibit private Revenge, not the use of Arms, for the defence of our Country, Body, Wives, Children and Goods, when the Magistrate commands it; seeing the Magistrate ought to be obeyed: Therefore albeit it be not lawful for private Men to do it of themselves, nevertheless they are bound to do it by the command of the Magistrate.</HI></P>
<P><MILESTONE UNIT="Answ."/> I answer; If the Magistratee be truly a Christian, or desires to be so, he ought himself in the first place to obey the Command of his Master, saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Christian Magi∣strates ought to o∣bey the com∣mand of their Ma∣ster <HI>Christ.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Love your Enemies,</HI> &amp;c. and then he could not command us to kill them: But if he be not a true Christian, then ought we to obey our Lord and King, Jesus Christ, to whom he ought also to obey: For in the Kingdom of Christ, all ought to sub∣mit to his Laws, from the highest to the lowest, that is, from the King to the Beggar, and from <HI>Caesar</HI> to the Clown. But (alas!) where shall we find such an Obedience? O deplorable Fall! Con∣cerning which <HI>Ludov. Viv.</HI> writes well, <HI>lib. de con. vit. Christ. sub.

Disc. de Revol. <HI>Belg.</HI> p. 85. <HI>The Prince enter'd into the</HI> Church,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lud.

And therefore, while they are in that Condition, we shall not say, That <HI>War,</HI> undertaken upon a just occasion, is altogether un∣lawful to them. For even as Circumcision, and the other Ceremonies, were for a season permitted to the <HI>Jews,</HI> not because they were either necessary of

themselves, or lawful at that time, after the Resur∣rection of Christ; but because that Spirit was not yet raised up in them, whereby they could be delivered from such Rudiments: So the present Confessors of the Christian Name, who are yet in the mixture, and not in the patient Suffering Spirit, are not yet fitted for this form of Christianity, and therefore cannot be undefending themselves, until they attain that Perfection. But for such, whom Christ has brought hither, it is not lawful to defend them∣selves by Arms, but they ought over all to trust to the Lord.</P>
<P N="16">§. XVI. But <HI>lastly,</HI> to conclude,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Con∣clusion.</NOTE> If to give and receive Flattering Titles, which are not used be∣cause of the Vertues inherent in the Persons; but are, for the most part, bestowed by wicked Men upon such as themselves: If to Bow, Scrape and Cringe to one another; If at every time to call one another <HI>Humble Servant,</HI> and that most fre∣quently, without any design of real Service; if this be the Honour that comes from God, and not the Honour that is from below, then indeed our Adversaries may be said to be Believers, and we condemned as Proud and Stubborn, in denying all these things. But if with <HI>Mordecai,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Esther 3.5. Job 32.21.22.</NOTE> to refuse to bow to proud <HI>Haman</HI>; and with <HI>Elihu,</HI> not to give <HI>Flattering Titles to Men, lest we should be re∣proved of our Maker</HI>; and if, according to <HI>Peter</HI>'s Example, and the <HI>Angel</HI>'s Advice, to bow only to God, and not to our Fellow-Servants; and if to call no Man <HI>Lord</HI> nor <HI>Master,</HI> except un∣der particular Relations, according to Christ's Command; I say, if these things are not to be reproved, then are we not blame-worthy in so doing.

if these be the Ornaments of Christians; and if that be to be Humble, Meek and Mortified; Then are our Adversaries good Christians indeed, and we Proud, Singular and Conceited, in contenting our selves with what Need and Conveniency calls for, and condemning what is more, as Superfluous; but not otherwise. If to use Games, Sports, Plays; if to Card, Dice and Dance; if to Sing, Fiddle and Pipe; if to use Stage Plays and Comedies, and to Lye, Counterfeit and Dissemble, be to Fear always; and if that be to do all things to the Glory of God; and if that be to pass our So∣journing here in Fear; and if that be to use this World, as if we did not use it; and if that be not to fashion our selves according to our former Lusts; to be not conformable to the Spirit and vain Conversation of this World; Then are our Adversaries, notwithstanding they use these things, and plead for them, very Good, Sober, Mortifi∣ed, and Self-denying Christians, and we justly to be blamed for judging them; but not otherwise. If the Profanation of the Holy Name of God; if to exact Oaths one from another upon every light occasion; if to call God to Witness in things of such a Nature, in which no Earthly King would think himself lawfully and honour∣ably to be a Witness, be the Duties of a Chri∣stian Man, I shall confess that our Adversaries are excellent good Christians, and we wanting in our Duty: But if the contrary be true, of ne∣cessity our obedience to God in this thing must be acceptable. If to Revenge our selves, or to render Injury, Evil for Evil, Wound for Wound, to take Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth; if to Fight for outward and perishing things, to go a Warring one against another, whom we never saw, nor with whom we never had any Contest, nor any thing to do; being moreover altogether ignorant of the cause of the War, but only, that

the Magistrates of the Nations foment Quarrels one against another, the Causes whereof are for the most part unknown to the Soldiers that fight, as well as upon whose side the Right or Wrong is; and yet to be so furious, and rage one against another, to destroy and spoil all, that this or the other Worship may be received or abolished; If to do this, and much more of this kind, be to fulfil the Law of Christ, then are our Adversaries indeed true Christians, and we miserable Hereticks, that suffer our selves to be Spoiled, Taken, Im∣prisoned, Banished, Beaten, and evilly Entreated, without any Resistance, <HI>placing our trust only in</HI> GOD, that he may defend us, and lead us by the way of the Cross unto his Kingdom. But if it be other ways, we shall certainly receive the Re∣ward, which the Lord hath promised to those that <HI>cleave to him,</HI> and in denying themselves, <HI>confide in him.</HI></P>
<P>And to sum up all; If to use all these things, and many more that might be instanced, be to <HI>walk in the strait way that leads to Life,</HI> be to <HI>take up the Cross of Christ,</HI> be to <HI>die with him to the Lusts and perishing Vanities of this World,</HI> and to <HI>arise with him in newness of Life,</HI> and <HI>sit down with him in the heavenly places</HI>; Then our Adversaries may be ac∣counted such; and they need not fear they are in the <HI>Broad Way that leads to destruction</HI>; and we are great∣ly mistaken, that have laid aside all these things for Christ's sake, to the crucifying of our own Lusts, and to the procuring to our selves Shame, Re∣proach, Hatred and Ill-will from the Men of this World.

<P>IF in God's Fear, <HI>Candid Reader,</HI> thou applyest thy self to consider this System of Religion, here delivered, with its Consistency and Harmony, as well in it self, as with the Scriptures of Truth, I doubt not, but thou wilt say with me, and many more, That this is the Spiritual Day of Christ's Appear∣ance, wherein he is again Revealing the Ancient Paths of Truth and Righteousness. For thou may'st observe here the <HI>Christian Religion,</HI> in all its parts, truly Established and Vindicated, as it is a Living, Inward, Spiritual, Pure and Substantial Thing; and not a meer Form, Shew, Shadow, Notion and O∣pinion, as too many have hitherto held it, whose Fruits declare, they wanted that which they bear the Name of: And yet many of those are so in love with their empty Forms and Shadows, that they cease not to calumniate us for commending, and cal∣ling them to the Substance; as if we therefore de∣nied or neglected the true Form and outward Part of Christianity, which indeed is (as God, the Searcher of Hearts, knows) a very great Slander. Thus, be∣cause we have desired People earnestly to feel after God <HI>near,</HI> and <HI>in themselves,</HI> telling them, That their Notions of God, as he is beyond the Clouds, will little avail them, if they do not feel him near: Hence they have sought maliciously to infer, that we deny any God, except that which is within us. Because we tell People, That it is the <HI>Light</HI> and the <HI>Law within,</HI> and not the <HI>Letter without,</HI> that can truly tell them their Condition, and lead them out

of all Evil: Hence they say, we vilifie the Scrip∣tures, and set up our own Imaginations above them. Because we tell them, That it is not their talking or believing of Christ's outward Life, Sufferings, Death and Resurrection, no more than the <HI>Jews</HI> crying, <HI>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</HI> that will serve their turn, or justify them in the sight of God; but that they must know <HI>Christ in them,</HI> whom they have crucified, to be raised, and to justifie them and redeem them from their Ini∣quities: Hence they say, We deny the Life, Death and Sufferings of Christ, Justification by his Blood, and Remission of Sins through him. Because we tell them, while they are talking and deter∣mining about the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> that they have more need to know the <HI>Just One,</HI> whom they have slain, <HI>raised in themselves,</HI> and to be sure they are Partak∣kers of the <HI>first Resurrection</HI>; and that if this be, they will be the more capable to judge of the <HI>Se∣cond</HI>: Hence they say, That we deny the Resur∣rection of the Body. Because, when we hear them talk foolishly of Heaven and Hell, and the last Judg∣ment, we exhort them to come out of that Hellish Condition they are in, and come down to the Judg∣ment of Christ <HI>in their own Hearts,</HI> and believe in the Light, and follow it, that so they may come to sit in the <HI>heavenly places,</HI> that are in Christ Jesus: Hence they maliciously say, That we deny any Heaven or Hell, but that which is within us, and that we deny any general Judgment: Which <HI>Slan∣ders,</HI> the Lord knows, are foully cast upon us, whom God hath raised for this end, and gathered us, that by us he might confound the Wisdom of the Wise, and bring to nought the Understanding of the Prudent; and might, in and by his own Spirit and Power in a despised People, (that no Flesh might glory in his presence) pull down that dead, dark, corrupt Image, and meer Shadow and Shell of Christianity, wherewith Antichrist hath deceived

the Nations: For which end he hath called us to be a First Fruits of those that serve him, and wor∣ship <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im no more in the Oldness of the Letter, but in the Newness of the Spirit. And though we be few in number, in respect of others; and weak, as to outward strength, which we also altogether re∣ject; and foolish▪ if compared with the wise ones of this World: Yet as God hath prospered us, not∣withstanding much Opposition, so will he yet do; that neither the Art, Wisdom, nor Violence of Men or Devils shall be able to quench that <HI>little Spark</HI> that hath appeared; but it shall grow, to the con∣suming of whatsoever shall stand up to oppose it. The <HI>Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it</HI>! Yea, He that hath arisen in a small Remnant, shall arise, and go on by the same Arm of Power in his Spiritual Manifestation, until he hath conquered all his Ene∣mies, until all the Kingdoms of the Earth become the Kingdom of Christ Jesus.</P>
<Q>Unto him that hath begun this Work, not among the Rich or Great Ones, but among the Poor and Small, and hath Revealed it not to the Wise and Learned, but unto the Poor, unto Babes and Sucklings; even to Him, the only wise and omnipotent GOD, be Ho∣nour, Glory, Thanksgiving and Renown, from hence∣forth and for ever. <HI>Amen. Hallelu</HI>-JAH.</Q>

<ITEM><HI>Redemption</HI> is considered in a twofold respect: <HI>First,</HI> per∣formed by Christ without us; and <HI>Secondly,</HI> wrought in us, 204, 205. It is Universal. God gave his only Begotten Son, <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> for a Light that whosoever believeth in him may be saved, 109.160, 161. The Benefit of his Death is not less Universal, than the Seed of Sin, 108, 109. There is scarce found any Article of the Christian Re∣ligion, that is so expresly confirmed in the Holy Scrip∣tures, 118 to 125, This Do∣ctrine was preached by the Fathers (so called) of the first six hundred years, and is proved by the Sayings of some, 125, 126, 127. Those that since the time of the Re∣formation, have affirmed it, have not given a clear Testi∣mony, how that Benefit is communicated to all; nor have sufficiently taught the Truth, because they have ad∣ded the absolute necessity of the <HI>outward</HI> Knowledge of the History of Christ; yea, they have thereby given the con∣trary party a stronger Ar∣gument to defend their pre∣cise decree of Reprobation; among whom were the Re∣monstrants of <HI>Holland,</HI> 110, 127 to 130. God hath now rased up a few Illiterate Men to be dispensers of this Truth, 131, 132, 180, 181. This Doctrine sheweth forth the Mercy and Justice of God, 133, 151, 152.

and the Freedom of Man's Will 124. It makes the Salvation of Man solely to depend upon God; and his Condemnation wholly, and in every respect, to be of him∣self, <HI>ibid.</HI> It takes away all ground of Dispair, and feeds none in Security, <HI>ibid.</HI> It commends the Christian Re∣ligion among Infidels, <HI>ibid.</HI> It sheweth the Wisdom of God, 135.

There is given to every one (none ex∣cepted) a certain Day and Time of Visitation, in which it is possible for them to be saved, 132, 153 to 160.

There is given to every one a measure of the Light, Seed, Grace, and Word of God, whereby they can be saved, 132, 133, 152, 153, 166 to 174. which is also confirmed by the Tes∣timonies of <HI>Cyrillus</HI> and o∣thers, 164 to 173.
