<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Excellent Sermon, which you have here put in∣to your hands. (I'm told) met with great and due Applause from a numerous &amp; judicious Audi∣ence, in the Preaching of it: and I doubt not will have equal Acceptance, in the Reading. It is a Sheaf of</HI> First Fruits <HI>from my worthy Brother, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Press; and I believe will be found</HI> very good, <HI>even</HI> like the Pigs that are first ripe, <HI>and can't fail of a singular Relish with all such as have</HI> their Senses exercised to discern what is good, <HI>and to</HI> approve the Things that are ex∣cellent. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> at the great Importunity of so many, who tasted the Sweet &amp; Benefit of it in the Hearing, for a further Pub∣lication thereof, an order to many others having a share with them. I'm persuaded the governing Aim of the Author in this Discourse was to give GOD the Glory of His surprising Goodness &amp; Wisdom in the Method He has chosen, of instructing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People by</HI> Men of like Passions <HI>with Themselves, and to lead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a just &amp; pious Appli∣cation of a</HI> Thought, <HI>which it may be has seldom and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but Few had its proper Weight &amp; Improvement. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bless GOD, who directed His Servant to such a Text, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> these Meditations upon it, and dispos'd him to give '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m the Publick—It is not the design of this Preface to enter into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Reverend Auth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, or give a Recommendation of his Performance. His Modesty F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ids the former; as well as my own, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are needless—However, I must be allow'd to say, That we have a</HI> Subject <HI>here treated of that is very instructive hath to Ministers &amp; People. It was certainly the best <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was preached, as well as for the Occasion. It seems to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> spoken
<PB REF="002638_0004_0FE5D8EEAB468978"/>
The Preacher sought out acceptable Words, faithful Sayings, and worthy of all Acceptation. <HI>Here we have a Variety of the wisest Lesson <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e'd to us; many just &amp; seasonable Caveats &amp; Ad∣monitions given; with weighty &amp; moving Exhortations; which if well entertained &amp; apply'd, wou'd be of no common service, to pro∣mote the great Interests of Religion, the Designs of the Evangelical Ministry.—And here also we are taught how to make use of this Subject for our</HI> Consolation <HI>in several Cases. Here Auditors are told how they may apply it to compose their Minds, to sit quietly under the Administrations of such as are not altogether agreeable to their Wishes. And here also Ministers are put in mind, to apply it for their Support &amp; Encouragement, under the dark Prospect of an Un∣successful Ministry. An inexpressible Grief this! But we must eye the Hand of GOD in it. If we have Success it is not to be ascrib'd to</HI> our own Power or Holiness. <HI>For who is</HI> Paul? <HI>and who is</HI> Apollos? <HI>But Ministers by whom Men believe,</HI> even as the Lord giveth to every Man. <HI>So then neither is he that planteth,</HI> any thing; <HI>nor he that watereth: but GOD—▪To Him we shou'd give all the Glory of our Success. And when deny'd that, if we are</HI> faithful, <HI>we may take Comfort in this; knowing that we are but Men, Men of like Passions with others; and that with</HI> Men <HI>it is impossible.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tho' (suffer me to add) we shou'd be very</HI> jealous of our selves <HI>in this Case, and examine strictly into our own Temper &amp; Conduct; lest by any means we shou'd have been</HI> accessory <HI>to our own Unsuc∣cessfulness and deceive our selves with a groundless Presumption of our unblamable Fidelity. Ministers are too often the faulty Causes (at least in conjunction with their People) of their want of Success. We are Men</HI> subject to like Passions <HI>with others. The brightest</HI> An∣gels <HI>of the Churches are but Spirits</HI> in Flesh; <HI>and have in them the same Principles of moral as well natural Corruption, common to others. And by their own Infirmities, They too often grieve the Holy Spirit, and provoke Him to deny His Blessing on their Endeavours. And as to many of Us, 'tis to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e fear'd, we may justly charge our selves with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Personal S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which do deservedly provoke GOD to frown on our Minister, and blast our Labours. I desire to</HI> smite on my own Breast <HI>in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and wish we may all (especially, such of us as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> Youth, <HI>the Age of Levity &amp; indiscretion) ex∣amin whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> &amp; Miscarriages, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of us ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge our selves with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ignorance; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shameful Negligence; with</HI>
<PB REF="002638_0005_0FE5D8CBB0E672A8"/>
<HI>a scandalous want of necessary Boldness &amp; Resolution in the Cause of GOD; or with criminal Imprudence; with very culpable De∣fects, in point of Conduct; with very sensible Defects in Grace, in true Holiness, and the Power of Godliness; having little of the Love of GOD in us, little of the Faith of CHRIST, or Fellowship of the SPIRIT; little compassion to Souls; little Regard to a∣nother World; little of the Spirit of Devotion, cold in our Prayers, formal in our Administrations,</HI> &amp;c.—.<HI>And now if this be our true Character, have we not abundant Reason to condemn</HI> our selves <HI>as the guilty Instruments of our own Unsuccessfulness! O</HI> Melancholy Reflection!—<HI>Would to GOD we may all bring our selves under a solemn Trial, try our own Spirits, and</HI> prove our own Works; <HI>repair all our too evident Defects, and</HI> study <HI>more</HI> to shew our selves approved unto GOD, Workmen that need not to be ashamed—.<HI>Thus will the most fatal Impediments to our Success be happily removed; and we may more groundedly expect the Divine Blessing on our Ministry, and the more comfortably reflect on the want of it. O that both Ministers &amp; People may sincerely unite in</HI> Lamenting after GOD, <HI>and in vigorous Endea∣vours to recover His Favour &amp; Presence, by removing the Grounds of His Controversy, and Withdraw from us!</HI></P>
<P><HI>But I will no longer detain the Reader from his better Entertain∣ment in the following Discourse.—I shall only add my humble Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes, for the worthy</HI> Author, <HI>that he may long be continu'd a rich Blessing in the Place (which so</HI> rejoyces in his Light <HI>at present</HI>) <HI>and see the Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of his Labours (of this in particular) to his great Joy.—Also for our dear</HI> Brother, <HI>at whose Ordination it was P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>h'd, That he may enter into (and long continue in) his Mini∣stry, with the</HI> fulness of the Blessing of the Gospel of Peace. <HI>Finally, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the good</HI> People <HI>over whom he is set; That they may every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> receive him in the LORD with all</HI> Gladness, <HI>and make their</HI> Profiting <HI>by him, appear to all Men.

<BIBL>ACTS XIV. 15.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>—We also are Men of like Passions with you—.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Chapter is a Continuation of the History of <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; <HI>Barna∣bas,</HI> their united Endeavours to Gospellize the Pagan World. We have an account that their Preaching in <HI>Iconium</HI> was at first remarkably successful. <HI>A great Multitude both of the Jews, and also of the Greeks, believed their Report.</HI> But there (as in every other place) Satan had his active In∣struments to oppose them. <HI>The unbelieving Jews</HI> maliciously &amp; industriously sought to render those holy Preachers of the Word, and all who embrac'd the Christian Doctrine, vile &amp; contemptible in the Eyes of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The Enemy of Souls and <HI>Fa∣ther of Lies</HI> never devis'd a more effectual way to hinder the progress of the Gospel, than to prejudice the Minds of People against the faithful Dispensers of it, by representing <HI>Zion</HI>'s <HI>Nazarites in a Visage blacker than a Coal.</HI> Notwithstanding the ill treat∣ment which these Apostles met with, yet <HI>they for a</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="002638_0007_0FE5D8CC734AB4F0"/>
<HI>long time abode</HI> in that City <HI>speaking boldly in the Lord.</HI> A Minister is not presently to go from a People, nor Cowardly to spare them in <HI>declaring the Coun∣sel of God,</HI> when there are many among them un∣reasonably disaffected to him. But when <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> saw the whole City in Confusion, and that there was a Murderous design on Foot against them, then they fled into other Cities: as CHRIST Com∣mandeth, or at least alloweth his Ministers to do, Mat. 10. 23. <HI>When they persecute you in this City, then flee ye into another:</HI> And as GOD opens to them a door of Escape out of one Place, so he doth a door of Opportunity in another. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Bar∣nabas</HI> coming to <HI>Lystra, Preached the Gospel there,</HI> and wrought a Miraculous Cure for the confirmation of their Doctrine, and to the astonishment of all who beheld it. A poor Cripple, who had been so <HI>from his Mother's Womb,</HI> and <HI>never had walked,</HI> Hearing <HI>Paul</HI> preach, was so affected with the Sermon, that he believed, the Speaker could not only say, but do great things, <HI>in the Name of Christ Jesus the Lord, whom he preached.</HI> The <HI>Apostle</HI> looking <HI>Stedfastly</HI> and Compassionately upon him, perceived by the Spirit of discerning, <HI>that he had faith to be healed.</HI> He therefore <HI>with a loud voice said</HI> unto the lame Man, <HI>Stand upright on thy feet.</HI> He doubt∣less said this <HI>in the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth:</HI> The Word was sent forth from him; for by it the Cripple was immediately and perfectly healed, which he discovered by <HI>leaping &amp; walking.</HI> And so an ancient Prophecy which relates to Gospel-times, was liter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly fulfilled: Isa. 35. 6. <HI>Then shall the lame man leap as an hart.</HI> This wonderfull work
<PB N="3" REF="002638_0008_0FE5D8FEC2E349D0"/>
was very surprising to the People who saw it and occasion'd an idolatrous Admiration of the Instru∣ments of it: <HI>They lift up their voices, saying in the speech of Lyca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nia, The Gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.</HI> They thought that the Gods whom the Nations worshipped, were come down in the Appearance of Men, and had done this extraor∣dinary Cure. They pretended to know which of the Heathen Deities these Persons were: <HI>Barnabas they called Jupiter; and Paul M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcurius, because he was the Chief Speaker.</HI> Probably Barnabas was one of a more Majestick Countenance and Deportment than Paul; therefore he was taken for <HI>Jupiter,</HI> the Supreme God, according to the Pagan Theogonie: and <HI>Paul</HI> speaking more than <HI>Barnabas,</HI> he was look'd upon as <HI>Mercury,</HI> the Interpreter of the Gods, the God of Eloquence. The People being so fully persuaded of the Divinity of these Persons, they presently resolved to honour them as <HI>Gods. Then the Priest of Jupiter which was before their City,</HI> (i.e. whose Statue and Temple were erected before the Gate of the City: <HI>Jupiter</HI> being accounted the Guardian and President of the City) the Priest of that Idol brought <HI>Ox<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> and <HI>Garlands</HI> to adorn the Victim with, <HI>and would have done Sacrifice with the people.</HI> As soon as <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> perceiv'd this, they manifested a great displeasure at it and detestation of it, <HI>They rent their Clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, and saying, Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, why do ye these things?</HI> They were earnest and Zealous to suppress the Idolatry of the foolish people. They rebuk'd them sharply for attempting to deif them. And to convince them of the Absurdity of giving
<PB N="4" REF="002638_0009_0FE5D8CE292D3AB0"/>
Divine Honours unto them, they said, <HI>We also are Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like passions with you.</HI>—We, the Apostles of Jesus, the Ministers of the Gospel, who Preach and do wonderful works in Christ's Name, are not <HI>Gods,</HI> as Ye ignorantly suppose us to be, although we are in God's stead. And it is a gross abomination to do such <HI>Service unto th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se who by Nature are no Gods.</HI> Neither are we <HI>Angels</HI> by Nature, though we are so by Office; and therefore are far from de∣serving of Religious Worship. We are <HI>Men,</HI> and <HI>but Men;</HI> Creatures of the same Nature with you unto whom we Preach: <HI>we are Men of like passions,</HI> both physical and moral, bodily and mental. We are not impassible and immortal as GOD is, but frail and mortal as Ye are. <Q>We are subject to the same Infirmities of the humane Nature, and liable to the same Calamities of the humane life</Q> There∣fore it is Blasphemous Folly in you to call us Gods, and to Sacrifice unto us as such.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE which may at this time be Illustrated and Applied is this, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<Q>DOCT. THAT the Ministers of the Gospel are Men of like Passions with others.</Q>
<P>THE Gracious GOD hath in infinite Mercy vouchsaf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a <HI>Revelation</HI> of his Nature and Will, of Man's Duty and Happiness; and in his adorable Wisdom he hath appointed and improved <HI>Men</HI> to Publish the same unto their Fellow-Creatures. <HI>The Law was given by M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses, the Man of God,</HI> Joh. 1. 17. He declar'd it to the People. Indeed the
<PB N="5" REF="002638_0010_0FE5D9005A50C930"/>
Israelites are said to have <HI>received it by the disposition of Angels,</HI> Act. 7. 53. But this intends no more than that the holy Angels were <HI>present</HI> at the giving of the Law on Mount <HI>Sinai.</HI> The Original Word, which is here rendred <HI>Disposition,</HI> is of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ral Number, and (as Just Criticks have observ'd) sig∣nifieth Companies dispos'd together or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in order. <HI>The Chariots of God were twenty thousand, even thousands of Angels,</HI> when he came down to <HI>Sinai:</HI> And so the Israelites did receive the Law among the Hosts of Angels. And this may be the mean∣ing of the Law's being ordained, and spoken by Angels, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. 19. <HI>Heb.</HI> 2. 2. That the glorious Angels attended the Lord in his delivering of it on the Mount. But God authorised <HI>Men</HI> to be the standing Teachers of the Law. <HI>Moses</HI> and the Pro∣phets were <HI>Men</HI> Jam. 5. 17. <HI>Elias was a man sub∣ject to like passions as we are.</HI> The Priests, the Mi∣nisters of the Lord, <HI>were taken from among men,</HI> Heb. 5. 1. Even <HI>Melchisedec</HI> was so, notwithstand∣ing he was <HI>without Father, without Mother, without descent,</HI> i. e. his Genealogy was not known. <HI>The Law made Men High Priests which had Infirmity,</HI> Heb. 7. 28. And the Gospel likewise Constituteth <HI>such</HI> the <HI>Ministers of the New Testament. Men</HI> were some of those purchased <HI>Gifts,</HI> which our Lord ascended into Heaven to <HI>receive for, and give unto men.</HI> GOD doth not <HI>personally</HI> or <HI>immediately</HI> declare his Will to us; nor send his <HI>Angels,</HI> those <HI>Ministring Spirits,</HI> in this way, to <HI>Minister unto the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rs of Salvation;</HI> but he Commissionateth <HI>Men,</HI> and those not <HI>perfect,</HI> to this Sacred Office of Preach∣ing the Gospel, 2 Cor. 4. 7. <HI>We have this treasure</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="002638_0011_0FE5D8D18774F368"/>
<HI>in earthen vessels.</HI> The rich treasure of the Gospel is put into brittle Vessels: it is brought unto poor perishing Sinners by frail Men like themselves.</P>
<P>NOW, althô we cannot see to the bottom of any of <HI>God's Counsels,</HI> yet there are some obvious Reasons of his appointing <HI>Men of like passions with others,</HI> to <HI>the Ministry of the Word,</HI> which do Justify the <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and display the <HI>Goodness</HI> of GOD here∣in, and much of the Duty both of <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>People</HI> may be learn'd herefrom. Let the following Reasons therefore be weighed.</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD appoints Men of like passions with o∣thers to be the Ministers of his Word, <HI>because he will treat with us about the things which belong to our everlasting peace, in such a</HI> familiar <HI>way, as is most accommodate to the Humane Nature.</HI> He <HI>know∣eth our frame: Remembreth that we are dust,</HI> and suits his <HI>Dispensation</HI> accordingly. It is an Instance and Argument of the Condescending Goodness of GOD that he doth not preach <HI>Personally</HI> unto us, nor send his Glorious Angels; but <HI>Men</HI> of the same Nature &amp; <HI>of like passions with ourselves,</HI> to reveal his Will unto us, and to treat with us about our spiritual and everlasting concernments. The Consideration of the weakness of the Humane Nature in its pre∣sent state of Imperfection and Mortality, determin'd the Alwise and Gracious GOD to <HI>this method</HI> of dealing with us for our Instruction and Salvation.</P>
<P>IF the <HI>Great and Dreadful GOD</HI> should speak <HI>Personally</HI> unto us, how could our weak faculties
<PB N="7" REF="002638_0012_0FE5D901C553B948"/>
bear the overwhelming <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Majesty,</HI> in which it becomes him to speak? When JEHOVAH <HI>thundred on the Mount, and the Highest gave his voice from Sinai,</HI> the People <HI>could not endure. And so terrible was the sight of the Mount burning with fire, and the sound of the Trumpet waxing louder and louder, and the voice of words, that Moses</HI> himself cryed out, saying, <HI>I exceedingly fear and quake. And the People entreated that they might not hear</HI> the voice of the Lord again, least they should <HI>die; but that Moses, and not God, would speak with them.</HI> And GOD approved of their Request. Should the Lord come down in such Splendid Equipage, and Preach the <HI>Gospel</HI> to us in the like Divine Glory, we should be no more able to endure, than the <HI>Israelites</HI> were at the Promulgation of the Law. We should be so <HI>troubled at his Presence,</HI> that we could not hearken to his Doctrine. The Terror of his Majesty would hinder the Attention of our Minds, and put us into the greatest Confusion.</P>
<P>OR if GOD should send his Holy <HI>Angels</HI> (which are Infinitely Inferior to him in Glory) to Preach unto us; yet the Lustre of Seraphim would dazzle and confound, rather then inform and edify us. <HI>Manoah'</HI>s Wife said unto him, <HI>a man of God came unto me, and his Countenance was like the Count∣enance of an Angel of God, very terrible,</HI> Judg. 13. 6. An Angel brought the first Tidings of a <HI>Saviour'</HI>s <HI>Birth,</HI> but his Appearance was so bright and glorious that the poor Shepherds were amazed: Luke 2. 9. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Angel of the Lord came upon them, and the Glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002638_0013_0FE5D8D2E3132FE0"/>
<HI>were sore afraid.</HI> GOD therefore considers our frame, and sends <HI>Men</HI> clothed with Flesh and Infirmities, and not <HI>Angels</HI> inrobed with light and glory, to preach unto us, that so knowledge and faith might in a familiar way be instill'd into our Minds and Hearts. And the <HI>Preacher</HI> can say unto the <HI>Hearer,</HI> as <HI>Elih<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> did unto <HI>Job,</HI> (Job 33. 6, 7.) <HI>Behold I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ay. Behold my Terror shall not make thee afraid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. MEN of like passions with others are appoint∣ed to be Ministers, <HI>because such can be Examples un∣to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lock.</HI> It is very requisite that the <HI>Preachers</HI> of Religion should be <HI>Patterns</HI> of it. An Exem∣plary Life of Gospel-Obedience is an Excellent means to bring People to the <HI>Knowledge</HI> &amp; <HI>Practice</HI> of true Godliness.</P>
<P>THIS is the shortest and easiest way of Instructi∣on: And without this our Preaching is commonly in vain. The Mind is soonest and most sweetly in∣formed of the nature and worth of Virtue, when it is represented by good Example. This way of Teach∣ing is adapted to the lowest Capacity. It is diffi∣cult for some <HI>Understandings,</HI> clearly to apprehend; for some <HI>Memories,</HI> long to retain; and for some <HI>Judgments,</HI> rightly to apply, the Rules of <HI>Holy Living,</HI> when they are only Doctrinally prescrib'd: But when they are Exemplified in a <HI>Sober, Right∣eous</HI> and <HI>Godly Conversation,</HI> all this becomes easy. A Traveller, who hath only oral directions given

him concerning his way; is in greater danger of wandring out of it, than if he had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>guide</HI> to go before him. It is easier to learn to write by looking on a fair <HI>Copy,</HI> than by hearing the Dis∣courses of the most accurate Scribe.</P>
<P>AND as good Example is useful to inform Men of their Duty, so it is likewise to <HI>incline</HI> and <HI>engage</HI> them to the performance of it. Examples do more forcibly strike the Affections, and influence the Practice of Men, than Precepts do. <HI>The Beauties of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>liness</HI> are never set off with so great advantage, as when they are display'd in a regular and upright, a holy and heavenly Conversation. Virtue dressed up in all the artificial <HI>Ornaments of Speech</HI> appears not so lovely and charming, as when by a <HI>Religious Life</HI> it is exhibited in its <HI>Natural Graces.</HI> All the Oratory of the Pulpit don't commend it to Persons Esteem, so much as doth a plain representation of it in a well order'd Conversation. <HI>Suadet Loquen∣tis Vita, non Oratio.</HI> The holy <HI>Life</HI> of the Speaker hath a more persuasive energy in it than his moving Expression. <HI>Such as obey not the word, may be won by the Conversation.</HI> In this way the <HI>believing Wife</HI> (who is not allowed to <HI>speak</HI> in the <HI>Church) may gain the unbelieving Husband,</HI> whom the Preacher cannot, (1. <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 1.) It is therefore necessary, that he who Preacheth to others, and presseth holy Duties upon them, should be an Example to his Hearers; agreable with that Divine Injunction, 1. <HI>Tim</HI> 4. 12. <HI>Be thou an Example of the Believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</HI></P>

AND consequently a Minister must be a <HI>Man of like passions with others.</HI> Indeed we are to be Imita∣tors of <HI>Angels,</HI> and ought to do the <HI>will of God on Earth, as they do it in Heaven.</HI> But were the <HI>holy Angels</HI> sent to preach the Everlasting Gospel, they could not be so <HI>complete</HI> and <HI>encouraging</HI> Exam∣ples to us, as <HI>they</HI> may be who are of the same Nature, <HI>and of like passions with us.</HI></P>
<P>ANGELS could not set us a Pattern <HI>complete</HI> and <HI>intire</HI> in all the parts of it. For <HI>we</HI> have <HI>Bodies</HI> as well as <HI>Spirits:</HI> and it is a Christian's daily Ex∣ercise to <HI>keep under his body, and bring it into sub∣jection.</HI> Humane Virtue consists in acting agreeably to the Humane Nature in its primitive constitution; that is, Right Reason's maintaining a proper Dominion over the Brutal part. But how could <HI>Angels</HI> (which are <HI>Spirits</HI> only) be Examples of Virtues, which consist in the due government of <HI>Sensitive</HI> Appetites? Could they be Patterns of <HI>Temperance, Chastity,</HI> and the like? None can by their Example teach us how to behave our selves in the <HI>circumstances of men,</HI> unless they communicate with us in the passions and circumstances of the Humane Nature.</P>
<P>FURTHER, the Example of <HI>Angels</HI> would not be so <HI>Encouraging,</HI> as that of <HI>Men,</HI> who <HI>are of like passions with us.</HI> For <HI>Angels, who excel in strength,</HI> to be constant, exact and universal in their Obedience; for them, whose Nature is pure and perfect, to shine as Lights in the World; what great Encouragement would this afford to <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>polluted</HI> Creatures, that they shall attain to the
<PB N="11" REF="002638_0016_0FE5D9047A629C08"/>
high pitch of Virtue and Holiness, which is required of them? Would the illustrious Virtue of Spotless Angels <HI>provoke the Emulation</HI> of fallen Creatures? If Men that are sensible of the Weakness and Im∣purity of their Nature, should hear <HI>Angels</HI> vehement∣ly inculcate the precepts of Religion, and propound their own Pattern as a Motive to Conformity, would they not think that such Rules were calcula∣ted only for the <HI>Angelical Nature?</HI> and that such great and difficult Duties were impracticable to Men? Would they take any pains to write after an Angel's Copy! But when they see the Doctrines of their Preachers, <HI>who are Men like themselves,</HI> in some good measure exemplified in their Lives, this raiseth their Hopes, excites &amp; enlivens their Endea∣vours. To see Men which have the same weak and depraved Nature that they have, Men <HI>Compassed</HI> with Infirmities, and assaulted with Temptations as they are, yet by the Help of <HI>Divine Grace</HI> (which is of∣fered to all) surmounting the difficulties of a Christian Course, this is a great Encouragement un∣to them, to engage &amp; continue in it: for this is a Convincing Evidence that the Things enjoyned them are not utter Impossibilities. The Apostle thus excites Christians to fervent Prayer: Jam. 5. 16, 17. <HI>Pray for one another</HI>—. Elias <HI>was a man subject to like passions as we are, and</HI> He <HI>prayed ear∣nestly,</HI> and effectually.</P>
<P N="3">3. MEN of like passions with others are appoin∣ted Ministers of the Gospel, <HI>because such are</HI> equally Concern'd <HI>with the People in the Message which they bring, and the things which they teach.</HI> Infinite Wis∣dom

saw it best, that the important Truths of the Gospel should as necessarily relate to the Preacher's, as to the Hearer's welfare: that the eternal Interest of Ministers, as well as of People, should be wrapped up in them; and therefore the former must be <HI>Men of like passions with the latter.</HI> Since Ministers are Men, the weighty Matters which they come to pub∣lish unto, and treat with others about, do as nearly concern their own Souls as their Hearers.</P>
<P>AND this gives a considerable advantage to their Ministry: for by reason hereof, People may with greater Confidence Commit their Souls to the Care of their Ministers; knowing that if they are wise for themselves, they will be faithful unto those whom they take the oversight of. Ministers being <HI>Men,</HI> if they imbibe &amp; vent any Error, they poison their own Souls as well as their Hearers. If they gather <HI>wild Gourds,</HI> instead of wholesome Herbs, for the <HI>Pot,</HI> they endanger their own Lives as much as Their's whom they are to <HI>feed.</HI> If the spiritual <HI>Guides</HI> mis∣lead people, they will inevitably fall with them <HI>into the ditch</HI> of perdition; yea, they'll be plunged deepest in Hell. If the spiritual <HI>Watchmen</HI> do not stand alway upon their guard, and be not attentive to espy &amp; give notice of approaching Dangers, they are as likely to be <HI>taken away by the sword</HI> as others. So that <HI>their</HI> Interest is the People's Security. This is an Argument persuading us of their Integrity and Faithfulness; and renders our Confidence in them more reasonable. Our spiritual <HI>Pilots</HI> do not stand on the shore, looking upon us, and only Calling to us in a Sea of Dangers; but they embark with us, and venture their Souls with ours in the same <HI>Bot∣tom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></P>

AND Ministers being as Men so deeply concern'd in the things, which they are to treat of, this doth excite them to <HI>Earnestness of Affection</HI> in Preaching unto, and striving with others for their Salvation. 1 Thes. 2. 8. <HI>So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the Gospel of God only, but also our own Souls, because ye were dear unto us.</HI> An <HI>Ambassador of Christ</HI> ought to deliver his important Messages in a <HI>lively</HI> manner, with an agreeable <HI>Fervour.</HI> He is to communicate not only <HI>light</HI> to the Understanding, but also <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat</HI> to the Affections: to be a <HI>burning</HI> as well as a <HI>shining light.</HI> And in order to this, it is requisite that his own heart should be <HI>warm,</HI> and that he should speak as One whose <HI>Lips are touched with a coal from the Altar.</HI> For in preaching "there is intended a Communion of Souls": and the Impression, which divine Truths make on the heart of the <HI>Preacher,</HI> is apt to be Communicated to the Hearer's Now Mi∣nisters being <HI>Men of like passions with others,</HI> and so equally Concern'd with them in the important Truths which they preach, they have the Advantage of another order of Creatures, uninterested in these Matters of infinite Consequence, to be affected there∣with themselves, and so to treat of them, as to move the affections of others "Passions are the best O∣rators". And what hath a greater tendency to excite them in the Speaker's breast, than for him to see himself equally Concern'd with his Hearers, in the Truths which he preacheth, relating to an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> World? "This giveth Accents of Vehemency to his Exhortations." 2 Cor. 5. 19, 20. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath Com∣mitted unto us</HI> (hath put in us, who are earthen

<P N="4">4. MEN of like passions with others are made Mi∣nisters <HI>because such may have</HI> Experience <HI>of the things which they preach unto others.</HI> Ministers being Men of like passions with others, they have not only a <HI>Speculative knowledge</HI> of, but also an <HI>Experimental acquaintance</HI> with those great things, which they are to instruct the people in. Their own Experience teacheth them the Corrupt Inclinations &amp; Disposi∣tions of the vitiated Nature in all Men. Prov. 27. 19. <HI>As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.</HI> <Q>The hearts of all Men living are in regard of natural Corruption, as like one to another, as the shadow of a Man's face in the water, is like to the face whose shadow it is.</Q> So that from what Ministers, who are Men, observe in themselves, they are able to speak unto others of the depravity and deformity of their Souls by Nature, and to affect them with a sense thereof. Altho' self-acquaintance doth not fully, yet it doth in a great measure in∣form them, how <HI>deceitful &amp; desperately wicked the Carnal heart is;</HI> and in what ways it opposeth the <HI>Work of Grace;</HI> and so they are the fitter Instru∣ments of Conversion.

under the pang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the New-birth. Psal. 51. 13. <HI>Then will I teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be Converted unto thee.</HI> Such may conduct Men to Christ and Holiness, by those Methods in which they were brought thereunto themselves Gal. 1. 15, 16. <HI>When it pleased God, who separated me from my Mother's Womb, and Called me by his grace, to re∣veal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood.</HI> Ministers being <HI>Men of like passions with others,</HI> they know what it is to be assaulted &amp; foiled by Temptations; <HI>They are not ignorant of Satan's devices;</HI> and therefore may the better direct others how to stand against the <HI>Wiles of the Devil.</HI> Luk. 22. 32.—<HI>When thou art Converted, strengthen thy Bre∣thren</HI> They know what it is to be afflicted in∣wardly &amp; outwardly: <HI>Knowing therefore the Ter∣rors of the Lord, they</HI> are the fitter to <HI>perswade men.</HI> And from their own experience of <HI>divine Consolati∣ons</HI> are the more meet <HI>Helpers of others joy:</HI> They will the more <HI>naturally care for their State,</HI> and be more able, with the Tongue of the learned to speak a <HI>word in season</HI> unto weary Souls. 2 Cor. 1. 4. <HI>Who Comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to Comfort them which are in any trouble, by the Comfort wherewith we our selves are Comforted of God.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. MINISTERS are Men of like passions with others, <HI>because they are to discharge the Sacred Office with great</HI> Condescention <HI>&amp; Compassion.</HI> Ministers ought to stoop to the Capacities, and to bear with the weaknesses of People. 1 Thes. 2. 7, 11. <HI>But we were gentle among you, even as a n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rse cherisheth</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="002638_0021_0FE5D8DD9FCDE820"/>
<HI>her children: you know, how we exhorted &amp; com∣forted, &amp; charged every one of you, as a father doth his children.</HI> They should feed them with <HI>Milk,</HI> when they are not able to bear <HI>strong meat:</HI> &amp; must speak to them <HI>after the manner of men, because of the Infirmity of their flesh.</HI> They should pity them un∣der all their Infirmities; and sympathize with them under all their Afflictions. These <HI>Servants of God must not strive, but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves.</HI> They must, <HI>if a Man be over∣taken with a fault, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; considering themselves, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they also be tempted.</HI> They ought also to deny themselves for their Hearers good: and to <HI>make themselves Ser∣vants unto all</HI> (as Paul did) <HI>that they may gain the more: willing to be made all things</HI> (that are lawful) <HI>to all men, that they may by all means save some. This I do</HI> (says the Apostle) <HI>for the Gospel's sake, that I may be partaker thereof with you.</HI> They should <HI>please all Men,</HI> so far as they can without displeasing GOD: and comply even with some humours of a People, for their spiritual advantage. <Q>They should take upon them every Man's Affection, and accom∣modate themselves to every Man's temper.</Q> 2 Cor. 11. 28 <HI>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended and I burn not?</HI></P>
<P>NOW that Ministers might with such Gentleness, Condescention &amp; Compassion behave themselves in their Office, it is convenient &amp; requisite that they should be <HI>Men of like passions with others:</HI> That they should have experience of the frailties &amp; infir∣mities of the humane Nature in their own persons.
<PB N="17" REF="002638_0022_0FE5D91554E5ABA0"/>
This softens their hearts, and teacheth them Com∣passion towards others. Heb. 5. 1, 2. <HI>For every high Priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both Gifts &amp; Sacrifices for Sins: who can have Compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is Compassed with Infirmity.</HI></P>
<P>MINISTERS are liable to the Temptations, Griefs, &amp; Miseries of their Brethren, that so they might pity them &amp; sympathize with them, and not be too harsh &amp; severe in dealing with those that are fallen into error &amp; sin. As Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> observes, 'GOD hath made the Speaker subject to the same Infirmities with his Hearers, that by this Means there may be a <HI>bridle</HI> on his Tongue, to Check him from an inordinate &amp; too bitter inveighing against the offences of others.</P>
<P N="6">6. MINISTERS are Men of like passions with others, <HI>because they are sometimes called to</HI> Suffer <HI>for the Gospel which they preach.</HI> The great <HI>Prophet,</HI> whom GOD raised up to us, <HI>of our Brethren,</HI> sealed his Doctrine with his blood. And those whom Christ sends to preach the same doctrine, He some∣times will have, in attestation of the Truth of it, to lay down their Lives. Hereby Ministers have gi∣ven the highest pledge of their Integrity, and have been gloriously instrumental of Propagating the Gospel, and strengthning the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith of Believers. The victory, which the primitive Preachers obtain'd over the Devil, was partly by means of their dy∣ing for the Gospel. Rev. 12. 11. <HI>They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the Word of their Testimony; and they loved not their Lives unto the</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="002638_0023_0FE59B68B3D4D838"/>
<HI>death.</HI> <Q>This their Courage &amp; Zeal help'd to Con∣found their Enemies, and to Convince many of the Spectators, and to Confirm the Souls of the faith∣ful.</Q> In this way (in which Angels could not) Ministers, being Men of like passions with others, may promote the Gospel, and help the faith of GOD's Elect: and they should readily &amp; chearfully do so when Called thereto. Phil. 2. 17. <HI>Yea, and if I be offered upon the Sacrifice &amp; Service of your faith, I joy, and rejoyce with you all.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. MINISTERS are Men of like passions with others, <HI>because GOD will have all the</HI> Success <HI>of their Work to redound to the honour of his own Name.</HI> GOD's Glory is the Supreme Reason and ultimate Aim of all his Dispensations. This he intendeth and advanceth by ordaining of <HI>imperfect Men</HI> to the work of the Ministry. Great and marvellous things are done by means of the <HI>Word preached.</HI> Hereby the Eyes of blind Sinners are opened; hard hearts are softened, dead Souls are quickned; Satan's strong Holds are cast down, and his king∣dom demolished. Miserable Souls are rescued out of his hands: and Believers are defended against his rage &amp; strength: The Saints are built up: <HI>The body of Christ is edifyed: Till we all c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me in the Uni∣ty of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the sta∣ture of the fulness of Christ.</HI> Now the Glory of these great Effects doth belong unto GOD: and that it might the more evidently &amp; undeniably appear so, He hath commissionated weak imperfect Men to be the Preachers of his Word. Indeed were the

<HI>Mighty</HI> Angels the Ministers of the Gospel, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se things could not be accomplished by all their powers: yet the honour thereof is more effectually secur'd to the <HI>Name of the Lord of Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s,</HI> by his em∣ploying &amp; succeding of frail impotent <HI>Men,</HI> in this glorious Work. 2 Cor. 4. 7. <HI>We have this Treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the Power may be of God, and not of us.</HI> The Ministers of the Gospel are in respect of their weakness, fitly com∣pared to <HI>Babes &amp; Sucklings:</HI> and in their weakness GOD's Strength &amp; Praise are perfected, to the great∣er Confusion of his Enemies. Psal. 8. 2. <HI>Ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the mouth of Babes and Sucklings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and avenger.</HI></P>
<P>THUS you see in some measure, how the <HI>Wisdom</HI> and the <HI>Goodness</HI> of GOD, in appointing <HI>Men of like passions with others,</HI> to be the Ministers of the Gospel, are display'd, &amp; do approve themselves to our Understandings—. And now what <HI>Influence</HI> this Dispensation of GOD ought to have upon the Hearts &amp; Conduct both of <HI>Ministers</HI> &amp; <HI>People;</HI> what use of the Doctrine is to be made, and what abuse thereof is to be guarded against by us; I proceed to shew, under the</P>

Yet their Sins of <HI>Infirmity,</HI> and of daily surreption, ought not to be pried into, with Eagle ey'd Malice: nor expos'd, to their disgrace, when they are no other than such as are common to <HI>Humanity.</HI> Their Fai∣lings should be cover'd with the Mantle of Christian Charity: an <HI>Accusation must not be received against them, unless</HI> supported <HI>by two or three Witnesses.</HI> Ministers have the same depraved Nature, which their people have; and the Tempter <HI>most</HI> violently

assaults <HI>them,</HI> as knowing <Q>What a Rout he may make among the Common Soldiers, if the Leaders fall, before their Eyes.</Q> Therefore People should forbear all invidious Reflections, &amp; harsh Censures. They should not insult over, nor inveigh against their Ministers for every little failing, as they are too apt to do: but should always manifest a tender pity of their Infirmities, and not labour to expose and aggravate those faults in them, which may be no other nor greater than the <HI>Spots of God's Children.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. ARE Ministers <HI>Men of like passions</HI> with o∣thers?

Among the <HI>Romans,</HI> if prin∣cipal Magistrates (saith a Learned Writer) did meet with one of <HI>Vesta'</HI>s Priests, they caused im∣mediately their Ensigns of Authority to submit, and they themselves respectfully gave place, as if they meant to confess them in a manner their Betters. Nor did those of the highest Dignity in the Com∣mon-Wealth, scornfully disdain, but rather ambi∣tiously affect, to be admitted into the College of <HI>Priests.</HI> And the Sacerdotal Robe hath been often dy'd with Purple. Now surely the Office and Persons of CHRIST's Ministers, <HI>the Stewards of the Mysteries of God,</HI> are more honourable; and <HI>Heathens</HI> may <HI>rise in Judgment against</HI> those, who despise the same.

<HI>the</HI> Truth, <HI>which they Preach.</HI> Many seek to excuse their Disregard of the Message, by their dislike of the Messenger. Persons are too prone to think that Ministers being imperfect Men, will justify their neglecting to hear or obey the Word. When Sinners will not give Entertainment to the Gospel, then they find fault with the Preachers of it; and are ready to flatter themselves, that this will bear them out, in the <HI>neglect of the great Salvation;</HI> and such will always have something to object. Matt. 11. 16, 17, 18, 19. <HI>Whereunto shall I liken this Generation? It is like unto Children sitting in the Markets, and calling unto their fellows, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced: We have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented. For</HI> John <HI>came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a Devil. The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous and a wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners.</HI> Persons that approve not of the method, which GOD hath chosen, to reveal his Will, and to treat with Sinners about their Eternal Happiness, would quarrel at any other dispensation, which they may now think would be better and more effectual. If GOD should humour their Peevishness, and send perfect Men, or glorious Angels, to Preach unto them, this would not avail. Luke 16. 30. 31. <HI>Nay Father, Abraham, but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. And he said unto him, If they hear not</HI> Moses <HI>and the</HI> Prophets, <HI>neither will they be perswaded, though one rose from the Dead.</HI> People should take heed of despising the rich <HI>Treasure</HI> of Gospel-light and Grace because of its

Although the Preachers of the Gospel are Men, yet we ought to receive it not as the <HI>word of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, but (as it is in truth) the Word of God,</HI> 1 Thes 2. 13.</P>

Then they will not <HI>Lord it over God's heritage:</HI> They will not take state upon them∣selves, and carry it with a Supercilious Haughti∣ness towards their People; but will be affable and <HI>easy of access,</HI> and ready to stoop unto any service, whereby they may profit the Souls of their Hearers, and may be able to make that appeal which the great Apostle did, Act. 20. 18, 19. <HI>Ye know, from the first day that I came into</HI> Asia, <HI>after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, serving the Lord with all</HI> Humility <HI>of mind.</HI></P>

But if upon strict Examination, they have ground to hope that they have <HI>obtained Mercy to be faithful,</HI> it may comfort them to think that it was <HI>not in their power</HI> to render the Word &amp; Ordinan∣ces, which they administred, effectual; they being frail &amp; impotent Men.

<P N="7">7. THE Truth which hath at this time been spoken to, might serve <HI>to quiet &amp; compose the Minds</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="002638_0033_0FE5D8E5D5B7A970"/>
<HI>of Persons, who Sit under the Ministry of One not in all respects</HI> Agreable <HI>to their Desires.</HI> It is readily granted, that no Man should account it a matter of Indifferency, what <HI>Preacher</HI> he commits his precious immortal Soul unto, to be instructed, and guided in the way to eternal Bliss. For altho' the Efficacy of any One's Ministry depends upon the blessing of Heaven, and GOD can save Persons by <HI>Means</HI> least suited to the <HI>End;</HI> yet it is the ordinary Practice of his Sovereign Grace, to do most for &amp; upon the Souls of Men by the <HI>fittest Means.</HI> But notwithstanding this, if by the disposal of the wise providence of GOD, a Man is placed under the Ministry of One, in whom there is not every thing that he may wish for; yet this Consideration, that all Ministers are <HI>Men of like passions with others,</HI> might serve to compose his Mind to a quiet and dutiful submission to the <HI>Ordi∣nance of GOD,</HI> and may keep him from being Con∣tentious. When there were <HI>envyings, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rifes &amp; di∣visions</HI> in the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> about their Mini∣sters; one saying, <HI>I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos;</HI> the Apostle propounded this, which we have been treating on, to their serious Consideration: 1 Cor. 3. 5. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ho then is</HI> Paul, <HI>and who is</HI> Apollos; <HI>but Ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</HI> They were no more than In∣struments, used by the GOD of all Grace. Such whom we account the best Ministers, cannot be the Authors, and those whom we may think inferiour to them, may be the Instruments, or Faith &amp; Salva∣tion to us. When a Person's Inclinations are not answer'd in the Settlement of a particular Minister (competently qualified) over him, Methinks he
<PB N="29" REF="002638_0034_0FE5D925AE96AA90"/>
should silence Discontent thus, <Q>GOD's Thoughts are not as Man's; and he may intend more good to my Soul, and to the Souls of my Children, by the Ministry of one, not every way pleasing to me, than should have been obtain'd by another's, which I more highly valued. GOD might see that I had too raised Expectations from Man, and too great a dependance upon Means, and therefore I am denied those which I apprehended most sui∣table, &amp; others (tho' they should be really weaker) may be greatly bless'd to me, when they are the best that I can peaceably enjoy, and be attended upon from a sense of duty to GOD, in obedience to his Will, an with dependance upon &amp; Prayer for his Blessing.</Q> 1 Cor 12. 31. <HI>Covet earnestly the best Gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. ARE Ministers Men of like passions with o∣thers? <HI>Hence a suitable</HI> Provision <HI>ought to be made for their outward Subsistence.</HI> They are not <HI>Angels</HI> by Nature, but Men; and are not here clothed with spiritual Bodies, as the Saints will be in the Resur∣rection-World. They now stand in need of <HI>Food &amp; Raiment,</HI> as well as others. They are <HI>Men,</HI> and should live <HI>as Men.</HI> They ought to be liberally Sup∣plied, by those among whom they labour, with the Necessaries &amp; Conveniences of <HI>humane Life.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is requisite to their <HI>Comfortable</HI> fulfilling of their Ministry.</P>
<P>HOW can <HI>they</HI> well discharge their Office, whose Minds are depressed &amp; discomposed with the Griefs and Cares, which unavoidably attend a state of <HI>Pe∣nury?</HI> Do not pinching Wants dispirit Men, and
<PB N="30" REF="002638_0035_0FE5D8E699BE31D8"/>
unfit them in a great measure for any publick Ser∣vice? Certainly Ministers being Men, they need outward Encouragement to their work; <HI>that he that ploweth, should plow in hope,</HI> 1 Cor. 9. 10. That Ex∣emplary Reformer King <HI>Hezekiah</HI> thought this ne∣cessary for the Priests under the law, they being ta∣ken from among Men. 2 Chron. 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 4. <HI>He command∣ed the People that dwelt in Jeru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alem, to give the portion of the Priests, and the</HI> Levites, <HI>that they might be encouraged in the law of the Lord:</HI> <Q>that is, That they might be heartned to study, to teach, to per∣form all the duties required of them by the div<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Law—.</Q></P>
<P>AND a necessitous Estate is accompanied with many Temptations to <HI>Unfaithfulness.</HI> Not that Mi∣nisters are free from such, in a plentiful Condition: neither will their outward Circumstances, whatever they be, excuse their Unfaithfulness. Yet when People keep their Ministers poor &amp; low, they Strong∣ly tempt them to Negligence &amp; Cowardice, to Dis∣content &amp; Worldliness, to Flattery and unworthy Courses: and let them consider <HI>whose</HI> work they are doing, while they tempt their Ministers unto such Evils.</P>
<P>BUT supposing a Minister be faithful (as we trust many are) while oppressed with Poverty, yet it is not likely that he should be so <HI>Successful.</HI> For his indigent beggarly condition procures him the con∣tempt, even of those, who are the faulty causes of it. How highly soever the affected Poverty of <HI>mendi∣cant Friers</HI> hath been reputed &amp; reverenced among the <HI>Papists;</HI> yet experience sheweth, that the pover∣ty of <HI>Protestant Ministers</HI> is that for which their
<PB N="31" REF="002638_0036_0FE5D92BD03D5940"/>
Persons are often despised, and their Instructions, Reproofs &amp; Exhortations disregarded. It is an ancient observation, Eccl. 9. 16. <HI>The poor man's Wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</HI> The <HI>Brightest Lights</HI> are very much obscur'd, to the Eyes of the World, by the interposing Cloud of Poverty. Not only the Grandees of the Earth, but the very <HI>Abjects</HI> are prone to contemn even very worthy Ministers, for their mean outward Circumstances. If the Preacher's <HI>Condition</HI> (faith one) be not, as well as his Pulpit, somewhat <HI>elevated</HI> above the lowest Station, few will mind his words or obey him.</P>
<P>AND since Ministers are <HI>Men of like passions with others,</HI> they ought to be provided with some∣thing of a worldly Estate to <HI>transmit</HI> to their <HI>Poste∣rity.</HI> A parental Affection and provident Care for their Children is allowable in them, as well as in others. They do not shew themselves Christians, but inhumane &amp; worse then Infidel Parents, who take no care to provide for their Children, whom they expect to leave in the World, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 8. Ministers are endued with humane Resentments, and it must be grievous unto them, to think that their Families will be left by them some of the most destitute on Earth—.</P>
<P>THUS from GOD's appointing <HI>men of like passions with others</HI> to be the Ministers of his word, un∣answerable Arguments may be drawn to prove that a liberal Maintenance should be afforded them. And the People who complain of this as an insupportable Burden, do Constructively Murmur against GOD for sending to them frail <HI>Men,</HI> and not <HI>Angels,</HI> or un∣bodied Spirits, to Minister unto them in holy things.

If there were nothing to be found in the BIBLE concerning this Duty of People towards their Mini∣sters, yet if they would but wash off the dirt, which blinds the Eyes of natural Reason, they might easily read it in the <HI>very frame of humane nature.</HI> But <HI>say I these things as a man? or saith not the Law,</HI> yea and the Gospel, <HI>the same also?</HI> 1 Cor. 9. 8.</P>
<P N="9">9.

The Work of the Ministry is not less difficult &amp; dangerous, than it is honourable to those who are employed in it. It is a Charge like that, in 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 20. 39. which a Mini∣ster hath given him of every Soul committed to his Pastoral Care,—<HI>Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life.</HI>—To <HI>watch for Souls, as they that must give account,</HI> is no easy task. Arduous &amp; Important are the Duties belong∣ing to the Ministerial Office.—Whoever engageth in it, must <HI>give himself continually unto Prayer.</HI> He must offer up Public Prayers, such as may, if possible, express the Desires of every silent Suppliant, whose Mouth he is unto GOD. He must not cease day nor night praying in secret for his People, that they may be saved. The state of every Soul under his care, must, so far as he can know it, be by him made mention of at the <HI>Throne of Grace.</HI>—A Mi∣nister of the Word is solemnly adjured <HI>to Preach the word, in season and out of season; and so to re∣prove,

He is to propound &amp; explain the great Mysteries of Godliness, and to press the necessary Duties of Christianity. He is <HI>to shew unto people their trans∣gressions: to cry aloud,</HI> without fearing of any face, or sparing of any Sin. He is to alarm sleepy Sin∣ners, and to refresh weary Souls: to <HI>change his voice,</HI> &amp; speak sometimes in the thundring accents of the Law's threatnings, &amp; sometimes in the sweet strains of Gospel-promises.—He is to administer the Sacraments to the duly qualified for the reception thereof.—He is to guide &amp; govern all under his In∣spection, by the Laws of the great King, whom GOD hath set on his holy hill. Ecclesiastical Authority, which he is vested with, must be exercised by him in <HI>loosing &amp; binding,</HI> as there shall be occasion. The holy Discipline, which Christ hath instituted, must with Courage, Prudence &amp; Impartiality be managed by him.—He is in his <HI>private converse</HI> to instruct and admonish, to warn &amp; exhort: to resolve the scrupulous, to comfort the dejected; to confute the erroneous; to establish the wavering; to seek the lost, &amp; bring back the straying sheep. He is to visit the sick, &amp; help them to improve their Afflicti∣on, &amp; prepare for their Death. He is as the Pilot of Souls, to direct them, when launching into the Ocean of Eternity, that they may not dash against the Rock of <HI>Presumption</HI> on one hand, or of <HI>Despair</HI> on the other.—Such like are the weighty Duties
<PB N="34" REF="002638_0039_0FE5D8E75C6B0640"/>
which a Minister hath to perform. This is the Work which he must do, maugre all the opposition of Earth &amp; Hell. He must be sincere &amp; faithful in all this, or he incurs a punishment more dreadful then Tongue can express, or Heart imagine.—And now is not this a Work that might employ the strength of <HI>mighty Angels?</HI> and yet it is required of weak &amp; imperfect Men. <HI>Who is sufficient for these things?</HI> Not a glorified Saint; not an Angel of God; much less is frail Man in the state of common Im∣potency. The Ministerial Charge is a burden too heavy for any Creature of himself to stand under. <HI>Onus angelicis humeris formidandum.</HI> And if the Shoulders of Angels wou'd shrink &amp; tremble under it, well may theirs, who are frail Men, which are crushed before the <HI>Moth.</HI> There is no Man who knows himself, &amp; what the Work of the Ministry is, but will undertake it with <HI>fear and trembling,</HI> when he is called thereto. It is an Argument of wretched Ignorance and Self-conceit, for a man to intrude himself into this hard and hazardous Office. Unqualified Persons, who presume that they are fit for this work, &amp; vain-gloriously seek to be improved in it, never rightly consider'd the nature &amp; difficul∣ty of it. There is no thinking Man engageth in it, but with a deep sense of the vast disproportion that there is betwixt his Duty and his Strength; and is ready to Apologize with the Prophet, Jer. 1. 6. <HI>Ah, Lord God, behold, I cannot speak, for I am a Child.</HI> And the longer faithful Men are exercised in this function, the more insufficient they find themselves for it, and the greater are their fears of miscarrying in it; and they would sink under this Burthen, were

THE <HI>Lord</HI> make him a <HI>fruitful Bough, even a fruitful Bough by a well,</HI> grafted into the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> and always GREEN, and <HI>flourishing in the Courts of our God:</HI> that under the refreshing <HI>shadow</HI> of his Ministry, <HI>weary Souls</HI> may <HI>sit down with great delight,</HI> and that the Fruit which shall con∣tinually drop from him, may be <HI>sweet to their taste,</HI> and nourish them to Eternal Life.—<HI>If the Archers do sorely grieve, and shoot at him, and hate him,</HI> yet let his <HI>Bow abide in strength, and the Arms of his hands be made strong by the hands of the migh∣ty God of Jacob: from thence is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel!—May the Blessings, which prevail to the utmost bound of the everlasting bills, be on the Head of</HI> Joseph, <HI>and on the Crown of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead of Him that</HI> is to be <HI>separated from his Brethren,</HI> or to be the <HI>Nazarite</HI> among them.</P>
<P>I shall now Conclude with a Brief <HI>Address</HI> unto the <HI>People</HI> of GOD, who have called this <HI>Servant</HI> of his to Minister in holy things unto them.</P>

<HEAD>HONOURED and DEARLY BELOVED IN THE LORD,</HEAD>
<P>WE heartily rejoyce with you this Day in the Manifestation of the Divine Favour to you, after the long Frowns of Heaven you have been under, respecting the Settlement of Gospel-Ordinances in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace.</P>
<P>YOU have here built a <HI>house to the Name of the Lord▪</HI> have provided a <HI>Habitation for the Mighty God of Jacob:</HI> [though not without the Noise of
<PB N="39" REF="002638_0044_0FE5D9353327B018"/>
Metaphorical <HI>Axes</HI> and <HI>Hammers,</HI> which is matter of Humiliation and Penitent Reflexion.] And the <HI>Ark of the Covenant</HI> is now with Religious Solem∣nity to be brought into this Tabernacle: the <HI>Wor∣ship of God</HI> in all the <HI>Ordinances</HI> thereof is to be set up in this House. ARISE, O LORD, into thy Best: thou, and the Ark of thy Strength. Let thy Priests be clothed with Righte∣ousness: and let they Saints shout for Joy.</P>
<P>YE also YOUR SELVES are to be Erected and Consecrated a Spiritual Temple unto GOD. <HI>Upon the Foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Corner-Stone, Ye are to be fitly framed together:</HI> and in <HI>Jesus Christ built together for an Habitation of God, through the Spirit.</HI> LIFT up your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eads, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates, and be ye lift up, ye Everlast∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and the King of Glory shall come in.</P>
<P>AND as a pledge, that the <HI>Lord God will dwell among you,</HI> our ascended Saviour, the Glorious Head of the Church, this Day bestows a precious <HI>Gift</HI> upon You: A <HI>Pastor</HI> (we trust) <HI>according to his own heart.</HI> Therefore do Ye Receive him with Thankfulness and Joy.—You have heard that the Alwise and Gracious GOD consults his own Glory, and his People's Advantage, in Ordaining of <HI>Men subject to like passions with others,</HI> to the Ministerial Office, and may not you be rationally assur'd, that you shall be well supplied with the
<PB N="40" REF="002638_0045_0FE5D8EDE0409398"/>
Food that is proper for your Souls, since he is JOSEPH YOUR BROTHER, whom GOD appoin∣teth <HI>Steward</HI> of his Family, to give to every one of you his Portion in due season.</P>
<P>LET me warn you against a Captious prying into, and a Malicious divulging and aggravating of Humane Infirmities and Failures, which he is liable unto with the rest of his Brethren.—Let the Time and the Breath, which too many are apt to spend in <HI>Censuring</HI> of their <HI>Minister,</HI> be rather improved by <HI>You</HI> in earnest <HI>Prayers</HI> for your's. Live in Peace, as with one another, so especially with your Minister, and be not like the People Characteriz'd, <HI>Hos.</HI> 4. 4.</P>
<P>LET the Nature of the thing, and the express precepts of the Gospel concerning it, be the Rule to your Consciences, directing of you in the Affair of his <HI>Maintenance,</HI> rather then any obligation you may by promise have laid your selves under unto him.</P>
<P>ATTEND upon his Ministry, as GOD's Institu∣tion, and with Prayer for GOD's Blessing; and so will it be profitable unto you.</P>
<P>In fine, SEE that you imitated the believing <HI>Ga∣latians,</HI> in their Affection to, and Reverence for their Minister, who was a Man of like Passions with them, and compassed with Infirmities; which kind and dutiful Behaviour of theirs towards him, be mentions to them, Gal. 4. 13, 14. <HI>YE know how through Infirmity of the flesh, I preached the Gospel</HI>

<HI>unto you at the first. And my Temptation which way in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected, but received me us an</HI> ANGEL OF GOD, <HI>even as</HI> CHRIST JESUS.</P>
<P>LET us all the Exhorted &amp; Excited so to demean our selves in the Sacred Relation of Pastor and People, as that when we shall (as within a few Years we all must) be taken from the Ministry and Ordinances of Christ on Earth, we may go unto <HI>Sion</HI> which is above, unto the Glorious <HI>City of the</HI> LIVING GOD, <HI>the Heavenly Jerusalem; to the General Assembly, and Church of the first-born which are written in Heaven to GOD the Judge of all and to an innumerable Company of Angels, and to the</HI> SPIRITS OF JUST MEN MADE PERFECT.</P>
