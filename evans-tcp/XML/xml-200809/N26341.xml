<HEAD>WISDOM: A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WISDOM I sing,— what bearded fage can choose</L>
<L>A theme more weighty, more sublime a muse?</L>
<L>A muse from which, if I but catch a ray,</L>
<L>The good shall bless, the just approve the lay.</L>
<L>Oh! thou the source of life, and light, and soul,</L>
<L>Thou Great Supreme, thou wisdom of the whole!</L>
<L>'Tis thine alone to light the Poet's flame;</L>
<L>The glory's thine,— JEHOVAH is thy name.</L>
<L>Unblest by thee, how poor the proudest strain!</L>
<L>Reason perplexes, genius shines in vain;</L>
<L>Wit sparkles in the dark, and Learning tries</L>
<L>On cobweb steps to climb into the skies.</L>
<L>Vain efforts all! tho' proudly all combine</L>
<L>To raise the giant Bard, he falls supine;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="035029_0002_0FFFEE93CC4167C8"/>
If thou, bright sun, art absent, all is shade,</L>
<L>Is darkness all, and soon the laurels fade.</L>
<L>Then grant, Omniscient, grant a heavenly beam.</L>
<L>To warm my heart, and sanctify my theme:</L>
<L>For tho an object worm, thy power, I trust,</L>
<L>Can make that worm sing praises in the dust.</L>
<L>Nor hopeless can it sing, for thou hast spoke,</L>
<L>And never was thy gracious promise broke;</L>
<L>Oh let it be remember'd in my strain,</L>
<L>That none can ever serve the Lord in vain.</L>
<L>Come then, Great Patron, and thy will be done,</L>
<L>For thou canst finish what thou hast begun;</L>
<L>Tho' feeble, pinion'd in the dust I lie,</L>
<L>Yet thou, the Great <HI>I AM,</HI> canst raise me high.</L>
<L>If thou but touch the mountains, they shall smoke,</L>
<L>Oh! strike that rock, my heart, &amp; be it broke;</L>
<L>The living waters will gush forth amain,</L>
<L>Run through the desert mind, and overspread the plain.</L>
<L>Thus as, erewhile, I silent, musing, sat.</L>
<L>In deep humility, at Wisdom's gate,</L>
<L>Soft o'er my breast a sacred servour came,</L>
<L>Caught the cold muse, and wrapt her in a flame.</L>
<L>Soft as the softest summer dews distill,</L>
<L>Sweet as the music of the trickling rill,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="035029_0003_0FFFEE9555EBD4E8"/>
The quick'ning effluence sell, and, close behind,</L>
<L>A small, but cogent voice, addrest my mind:—</L>
<L>'Tho' Wisdom cries aloud, and in the streets,</L>
<L>'Utters her voice to every one she meets;</L>
<L>'Tho' pleads, persuades, enforces and alarms,</L>
<L>'While, sweetly eloquent, the charmer charms,</L>
<L>'Deaf as an adder to the sacred strain,</L>
<L>'Folly prevails, and WISDOM pleads in vain.</L>
<L>'And is there none, none willing to defend</L>
<L>'Her glorious cause? no proselyte or friend?</L>
<L>'Arise, young man, in all the power of truth,</L>
<L>'Be thine the task, wed WISDOM in thy youth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus far the voice persuasive—but the muse</L>
<L>Unequal to the task, would fain refuse;</L>
<L>When, lo! more awful speaks the eternal word—</L>
<L>'Go on, fear not, I'm with thee, I the Lord.'</L>
<L>Obedient now, with faith I take the pen—</L>
<L>Awake, arise, attend, ye sons of men!</L>
<L>Before the Almighty Fiat had gone forth,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Before depths were, or ever was the earth,</L>
<L>From everlasting—ere the hills were made,</L>
<L>Or the foundations of the mountains laid;</L>
<L>Before creation's ensigns were unfurled,</L>
<L>Or raised the lofty summits of the world,</L>
<L>She was—*********—</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="035029_0003_0FFFEE9555EBD4E8"/>
When first the great Creator did prepare</L>
<L>The heavens, and heaven of heavens, she was there.</L>
<L>WISDOM divine! adorable the name!</L>
<L>Death and destruction, both have heard her fame.</L>
<L>Who knows her, knows, as did her sons of old,</L>
<L>How much more valued she than Ophir's gold.</L>
<L>The precious onyx, and the saphire, are,</L>
<L>With her, too mean, too worthless, to compare.</L>
<L>Talk not of corals, pearls, and such-like wares,</L>
<L>For above rubies is the price she bears.</L>
<L>Her dower is honour, riches, length of days,</L>
<L>Her paths are peace, and pleasant all her ways.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So sung the Bard affliction taught to sing,</L>
<L>And so her own sweet child, the experienced king;</L>
<L>And tho' but few the immortal songs receive,</L>
<L>And fewer still the eternal truths believe:</L>
<L>Yet WISDOM is a mistress all pursue;</L>
<L>The false, too oft mistaken for the true</L>
<L>In nature's pride they wish the heavenly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</L>
<L>Seek it in earth, in seas, in air, and skies,</L>
<L>And every place but where the jewel lies.</L>
<L>Why glories this man in intrigues of state,</L>
<L>Why that in learned harangues, and deep debate;</L>
<L>Why one in proud philosophy—and why</L>
<L>Another in thy arts, sweet poetry:</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="035029_0004_0FFFEE97CED3CAA8"/>
Why this in Cynic, that in Stoic rules,</L>
<L>And why, ah why! in foolishness e'en fools?</L>
<L>Oh WISDOM! injured beauty, 'tis thy fame</L>
<L>They vainly court; thy everlasting name!</L>
<L>Like earthly suitors 'mong the men of parts,</L>
<L>But few, too few, are lovers in their hearts;</L>
<L>With toys, and trifles, some would win thy praise,</L>
<L>And some by study's more laborious ways.</L>
<L>The trifler and the student are the same,</L>
<L>Dissemblers both, and know thee but by name.</L>
<L>With borrow'd jewels they approach thy shrine,</L>
<L>Rich in the lore of every grace but thine;</L>
<L>Adorn'd with all fair science can bestow,</L>
<L>Or truth impart, or moral virtue know;</L>
<L>But still distemper'd, like a sick man's dream,</L>
<L>The heart unhallow'd, blesses not thy beam.</L>
<L>And but for this, a Bolingbroke had stood</L>
<L>First in the rank, among the wise and good;</L>
<L>And but for this, in philosophic same,</L>
<L>Learning and wisdom had been still the same,</L>
<L>Like stars of greatest magnitude had shone,</L>
<L>Forever wedded, and forever one.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye worst of counterfeits, ye falsely wise,</L>
<L>Why toil ye thus in vanity and lies?</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="035029_0004_0FFFEE97CED3CAA8"/>
Say, what avails, to know what angry stars</L>
<L>Threat kings with death, and states with bloody wars?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What insect tribes on earth's broad surface creep,</L>
<L>What finny shoals inhabit in the deep;</L>
<L>In air aloft, what feather'd nations soar,</L>
<L>What savage monsters through the desart roar;</L>
<L>What bears the field, or what the lonely wood,</L>
<L>Of herbs for physic, or of plants for food;</L>
<L>To know all nature's secrets, what avails,</L>
<L>If in a greater point your knowledge fails?</L>
<L>Know ye yourselves—alas! how vain to roam</L>
<L>In search of that which must be found at home!</L>
<L>Have ye found WISDOM? 'tis a gross mistake,</L>
<L>A dream that will be painful when you wake.</L>
<L>Claim not the glorious title of my song,</L>
<L>To you, proud nat'ralists it can't belong;</L>
<L>Exterior honours may be man be given,</L>
<L>But WISDOM is a name that's wrote in heaven.</L>
<L>Speak thou, Horatio, thou, the pride of schools,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great sophister, revered by learned fools,</L>
<L>Say, for thou canst, in what their studies end;</L>
<L>Confess, be honest, and I'll call thee friend.</L>
<L>When heaps of volumes have been ponder'd o'er,</L>
<L>When cross'd each sea, and travers'd every shore;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="035029_0005_0FFFEE9A4C202428"/>
When learnt the songs the heathen bards have sung,</L>
<L>Skill'd in each art, and vers'd in every tongue;</L>
<L>When all the Alps of science are o'erpast,</L>
<L>Tell me, Horatio, what is gain'd at last?</L>
<L>'The world's applause, perhaps the prince's smile,</L>
<L>'And flatt'ry's pois'nous potions, smooth as oil;</L>
<L>'The poet's laurel, or the victor's palm,</L>
<L>'But not one drop of Gilead's precious balm.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then poor is every recompence beside,</L>
<L>Vainly pre-eminent, ye wander wide;</L>
<L>'Tis nought but folly still to study on,</L>
<L>To weary out the flesh, and ne'er have done;</L>
<L>Still o'er your toils will darker doubts arise,</L>
<L>And you'll be farther still from being wise.</L>
<L>There are who boast (so great is human pride)</L>
<L>Reason alone, and laugh at all beside;</L>
<L>Who measure all things by its glimm'ring ray,</L>
<L>Nor heed the sunshine of the gospel day.</L>
<L>Tho born, oh Britain, on thy awful shore,</L>
<L>Where Judah's Lion has been heard to roar,</L>
<L>Tho' train'd, oh Albion, in thy happy Isle,</L>
<L>Where truth and freedom wear a holy smile,</L>
<L>About thee still remain their country's shame,</L>
<L>Apostates scornful of the Christian name;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="035029_0005_0FFFEE9A4C202428"/>
Who, all unawed, in mortal prowess stand,</L>
<L>Ready to question each divine command;</L>
<L>Eager to blot, with more than Jewish rage,</L>
<L>The glorious truths that fill the Christian page;</L>
<L>Tho' proved, through ages, by the just and good,</L>
<L>And sign'd, &amp; seal'd, with many a martyr's blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lo, on false Wisdom's pinnacle, how proud,</L>
<L>Hilarius stands, and overlooks the croud!</L>
<L>Great Newton gone, his heart exults to see</L>
<L>None in astronomy more learnt than he.</L>
<L>So far he trusts his reason in the skies,</L>
<L>He half suspects his bible tells him lies.</L>
<L>'Sun, stand thou still in Gibeon, 'Joshua said,</L>
<L>'And thou, oh moon! in Ajalon be stay'd'</L>
<L>And is't not written that they both obey'd?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas writ, and 'twas believed,' Hilarius cries,</L>
<L>'In ancient times, but moderns are more wise;</L>
<L>'Nor sun, nor moon, to me it plain appears,</L>
<L>'Could ever stop, unless expell'd their spheres.</L>
<L>'And if from thence one moment they were hurl'd,</L>
<L>'At once would perish every lower world.'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus argue rationals, nor will believe,</L>
<L>Of WISDOM aught, beyond what they conceive,</L>
<L>But know, Hilarius, if the power I sing</L>
<L>Finds in thy heart one tender trembling string,</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="035029_0006_0FFFAE442738BDB0"/>
On which to strike, the muse may stay thee soon,</L>
<L>Tho' hard thou seem'st to stop, as sun or moon.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, first, of reason why this proud dispute,</L>
<L>Why proud of that which but o'erlooks the brute?</L>
<L>In things exposed quite obvious to the view,</L>
<L>What, with thy boasted reason, canst thou do?</L>
<L>Canst thou dissect an atom? canst thou frame</L>
<L>The spider's textile dome, or grasp a flame;</L>
<L>Canst thou, audacious! to Olympus rise,</L>
<L>And stop the rapid lightning when it flies?</L>
<L>If here thy reason fails, and thou refuse</L>
<L>To answer aught before a trembling muse,</L>
<L>Thus to thy heart (oh let thy heart be aw'd!)</L>
<L>In powerful Wisdom speaks the voice of God—</L>
<L>'Gird up thy loins, oh man! before me stand,</L>
<L>'And answer thou to what I shall demand.</L>
<L>'If thou hast understanding show it now—</L>
<L>'When first I founded earth, say, where wast thou?</L>
<L>'Knowst thou whereon 'tis fasten'd? is it thine</L>
<L>'Now to declare what mighty hand divine</L>
<L>'Its measures spread, who stretch'd the line thereon,</L>
<L>'Or who it was that laid the corner stone?</L>
<L>'What time the morning stars together sang,</L>
<L>'And heaven with joyful acclamations rang?</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="035029_0006_0FFFAE442738BDB0"/>
'Hast thou an arm like God, thou earthly limb!</L>
<L>'Or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</L>
<L>'Are heaven's high ordinances thine to scan,</L>
<L>'Canst thou on earth their great dominion plan?</L>
<L>'Canst thou the Pleiades sweet influence bind,</L>
<L>'Or loose Orion's bands, and rule the wind?</L>
<L>'Canst thou, in season, bring huge Mazz'roth forth,</L>
<L>'Or guide Arcturus o'er the stormy north?</L>
<L>'Have death's dark gates been open'd to thy sight,</L>
<L>'Or dost thou know the place where dwelleth, light?'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Abash'd Hilarius stands; and, quite controul'd,</L>
<L>Trembles that heart, which was of late so bold,</L>
<L>Mute is that tongue which ne'er was mute before,</L>
<L>Reason adores—nor can the mortal more.</L>
<L>Yet stay, Hilarius, yet a moment stay,</L>
<L>Nor let vain notions hurry thee away.</L>
<L>Now, while thy soul, thus solemnly o'eraw'd,</L>
<L>Trembles beneath the idea of a God,</L>
<L>With faith affirms his being, nor denies</L>
<L>But that he is almighty, and all-wise;</L>
<L>Oh keep the grand conception in thy view,</L>
<L>And let the muse the important point pursue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His truth endures forever—and his fame</L>
<L>Is everlasting—holy is his name!</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="035029_0007_0FFFEE9D5E60B008"/>
What can he not? his powerful word of old</L>
<L>Lighted the stars, and cloath'd the sun in gold,</L>
<L>Tinctur'd the moon with silver, bade them shine</L>
<L>And order'd all with majesty divine.</L>
<L>As at his word thus gloriously they shone,</L>
<L>All brightness, though but dust beneath his throne,</L>
<L>So at his word, by Joshua convey'd,</L>
<L>The sun stood still—the moon obedient stay'd</L>
<L>Perith the thought, in which it is conceived</L>
<L>What passes reason should not be believed.</L>
<L>Reason, Hilarius, ever wanders wide,</L>
<L>Unless she walks with WISDOM by her side.</L>
<L>Her powers exerted, may be false or true,</L>
<L>As good, or bad, the purpose they pursue.</L>
<L>False is her light, and endless may she stray,</L>
<L>When pride in nat'ral knowledge leads the way</L>
<L>But sure her path, when faithful virtue guides,</L>
<L>And humble, awful, holy fear presides.</L>
<L>Then is she fair, and noble, fit to rule,</L>
<L>And judge aright; but truant once from school</L>
<L>(The school of WISDOM) nothing is so bad;</L>
<L>No frenzy half so desperately mad.</L>
<L>Reason, unawed, runs counter to her rule,</L>
<L>Loses her function, and becomes a fool.</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="035029_0007_0FFFEE9D5E60B008"/>
In speculation's fields she roams abroad,</L>
<L>And, in dead works, forgets the living God;</L>
<L>Distrusts his truths, and dares his power assail,</L>
<L>Arm'd like Goliah, in a coat of mail;</L>
<L>A heart so harden'd, that it dares defy</L>
<L>E'en all the armies of a God most high;</L>
<L>Wit, like a brazen helmet, may be said</L>
<L>To glare, and cast false lustre from her head;</L>
<L>Learning her pompous target may appear;</L>
<L>Her staff, vain-glory Argument, her spear;</L>
<L>Before her bold Presumption bears her shield;</L>
<L>And thus 'gainst God himself, she takes the field.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is this true reason? never be it said</L>
<L>A thought so impious in thy heart was bred.</L>
<L>True reason is intelligent, and knows</L>
<L>The sacred source from which her current flows</L>
<L>In all the wond'rous works she meets abroad,</L>
<L>She owns her blindness, and submits to God.</L>
<L>But why abroad for wonders should we roam,</L>
<L>When greater wonders, may be found at home?</L>
<L>That sun or moon should stop, thou think'st it strange,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unless the system of the skies could change;</L>
<L>But is't not stranger, proof of greater power,</L>
<L>Thou e'er had'st life, or now should'st live an hour?</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="035029_0008_0FFFEEA0C3036C60"/>
Knowst thou the nature of the human frame,</L>
<L>That world of wonders, more than we can name?</L>
<L>Say, hast thy busy curious eye surveyed</L>
<L>The proofs of boundless WISDOM there display'd?</L>
<L>How rang'd each fibre, with amazing skill,</L>
<L>That every muscle may attend thy will;</L>
<L>How every tendon acts upon its bone,</L>
<L>And how the nerves receive their nicer tone:</L>
<L>Convey the keen vibrations of the sense,</L>
<L>And give the wakeful mind intelligence;</L>
<L>How some strong guard, each vital part sustains</L>
<L>How flows the purple balsam through the veins</L>
<L>That, how commix'd, disposed, how wond'rous these—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here in one trunk, they're ramify'd like trees;</L>
<L>The finer vessels of the brain how small,</L>
<L>How numberless; and yet we see not all,</L>
<L>But see enough, Hilarius, for we see</L>
<L>God is the maker, and his creatures we.</L>
<L>'Tis not for us to question, but to praise</L>
<L>The great Creator, wise in all his ways.</L>
<L>But say, can reason, or can ought below,</L>
<L>Make heavenly streams from earthly fountains flow?</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="035029_0008_0FFFEEA0C3036C60"/>
Can man, polluted, praise the God of light?</L>
<L>Not pure are purest Angels in his sight.</L>
<L>Oh then, what muse can proper praise inspire,</L>
<L>'Hallow the heart, and touch the lips with fire?'</L>
<L>To WISDOM only does the power belong,</L>
<L>WISDOM, the muse, the mistress, and the song!</L>
<L>Vain is all praise, unless by her 'tis given;</L>
<L>Her's is the praise of every harp in heaven.</L>
<L>Music is all her own, she tunes the spheres,</L>
<L>And sets to numbers, hours, days, months, &amp; years;</L>
<L>And, what is more, Hilarius, does impart</L>
<L>Her notes celestial to the human heart—</L>
<L>Attunes the springs of joy, and charms despair,</L>
<L>Calms to sweet peace, and opes the door of prayer:</L>
<L>Gives the sick soul with livelier hopes to rise,</L>
<L>And seek an heritage beyond the skies.</L>
<L>Oh, what amazing wonders does she hear!</L>
<L>Makes barren fruitful, makes the rough path clear,</L>
<L>Makes roses spring where thistles grew before,</L>
<L>And lambs to bleat where wolves were wont to roar.</L>
<L>Before her tempests cease, and storms subside,</L>
<L>Rocks melt and mountains sink, and seas divide,</L>
<L>O'er death's dark shades she pours her living ray,</L>
<L>And ope's the gates of everlasting day.</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="035029_0009_0FFFEEA32FB48640"/>
Can Reason this? then why art thou distrest</L>
<L>At aught in life, or why not always blest?</L>
<L>When friends, or fortune, take their hasty leave,</L>
<L>Why art thou then so great a fool to grieve?</L>
<L>For grieve thou wilt: nor all thy reason can</L>
<L>Dry up thy tears, and make thee more a man.</L>
<L>When o'er thy head affliction's billows roll,</L>
<L>And big distress weighs down thy sinking soul,</L>
<L>Can reason guide thee to a happier coast,</L>
<L>And land thee safe, that not a hair be lost?</L>
<L>Then why dost tremble—why heaven's aid im∣plore?</L>
<L>'Tis plain thy reason helps thee then no more.</L>
<L>And what, Hilarius, if I dare to say,</L>
<L>Mere human reason knows not how to pray?</L>
<L>Thou beg'st a blessing, think'st the boon no worse,</L>
<L>Which might, if granted, prove to thee a curse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Teach my best reason reason'—he who said,</L>
<L>Most wisely thought, and most devoutly pray'd.</L>
<L>Without that WISDOM infinite, which guides</L>
<L>Our finite views, and good from bad divides,</L>
<L>'Tis not in human wit, nor human might,</L>
<L>To act, or pray, or think one thought aright.</L>
<L>Tho thy proud genius build its house as high,</L>
<L>As human knowledge possibly can fly,</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="035029_0009_0FFFEEA32FB48640"/>
Prop it with reason, prouder still to rise,</L>
<L>And tell the world that lie, that thou art wise:</L>
<L>Not long the house so rais'd, so prop'd, can stand,</L>
<L>For, 'like the fools,' 'tis built upon the sand,</L>
<L>Tho' bold the truth, accept it, for it flows</L>
<L>Free from a heart that dictates what it knows:</L>
<L>Free from a muse, who near the sacred fount</L>
<L>Of WISDOM sings; nor seeks the Aonian Mount:</L>
<L>Who courts no patron, no scholastic aid,</L>
<L>No alien grace, nor Heliconian maid,</L>
<L>But trusts her humble, artless song to all</L>
<L>With simple truths of power, to save or kill:</L>
<L>Through him alone, who ancient is of days—</L>
<L>From babes and sucklings he ordains the praise.</L>
<L>Dost ask what praise? oh let thy reason bow!</L>
<L>Know thy own self, and haply thou shalt know</L>
<L>More than a sun is in thee, though 'tis hurl'd</L>
<L>Beneath the worthless rubbish of the world;</L>
<L>Immers'd in vanity's inconstant tide,</L>
<L>And buried deep beneath the waves of pride.</L>
<L>Though undiscover'd in thy nat'ral will,</L>

<L>The darkest dungeons sin and death can find:</L>
<L>Flashes conviction through the proudest breast,</L>
<L>And brings each boasted virtue to the test:</L>
<L>Makes manifest whate'er is wrong or right,</L>
<L>And shines the just man's ever burning light.</L>
<L>Tho suns, and stars, and this terraqueous globe,</L>
<L>And you blue firmament, should all disrobe;</L>
<L>Tho night, with tenfold darkness, intervene,</L>
<L>And second chaos more deform the scene;</L>
<L>Yet will it glitter through the general gloom,</L>
<L>And hell itself be forc'd to give it room;</L>
<L>While fierce Gehenna's troops, with dread amaze,</L>
<L>See, and believe, and tremble as they gaze.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho different nations hold a different creed,</L>
<L>As at the Ganges taught, or near the Tweed;</L>
<L>Tho sects divide, and sub-divide again,</L>
<L>Like parting rivers, seeking still the main,</L>
<L>The nice distinction lies but in the name,</L>
<L>For virtue, grace, and goodness, are the same.</L>
<L>Could the eye glance beyond the bounds of time,</L>
<L>Or the thought soar thro regions more sublime,</L>
<L>Yet all remote from WISDOM might we stray,</L>
<L>And midst stupendous systems lose our way.</L>

In his own sphere, man's proper business lies;</L>
<L>In his own heart, the rule to make him wife,</L>
<L>The voice that thunders on the mountain's brow,</L>
<L>And stirs the bottom of the deep below:</L>
<L>The voice that roars, where'er the tempest rolls,</L>
<L>And rends the isles, and shakes the distant poles;</L>
<L>The voice that spake, 'as never man was heard.</L>
<L>Speaks in thy heart—oh be that voice revered!</L>
<L>Be passion still, parts, genius, over-awed,</L>
<L>The voice of WISDOM is the voice of God.</L>
<L>Mild as the breath of summer, or the gales</L>
<L>Of young Favonius, o'er the smiling vales,</L>
<L>Soft as the love-lorn mourner's secret sigh,</L>
<L>It whispers to thy soul—'why wilt thou die!'</L>
<L>Why in a land of sorrows and of tears,</L>
<L>Where joys are thinly sown, &amp; choak'd with cares;</L>
<L>Where cease<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess change afflicts the roving eye,</L>
<L>And nature's brightest beauties bloom to die,</L>
<L>Where parting comforts, ever on the wing,</L>
<L>Tho closely ty'd, must soar, and break the string.</L>
<L>Why seek, amidst the dying, and the dead,</L>
<L>For false support, for that which is not bread?</L>
<L>'Why, with a soul of pure, etherial sires,</L>
<L>Fed with high hopes, and infinite desires,</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="035029_0011_0FFFEEA82CBF7990"/>
With life and immortality in view,</L>
<L>Make earth your home, and every toy pursue?</L>
<L>Ah, how deceived, amidst thy choicest store,</L>
<L>Indulg'd in all, till thou canst ask no more!</L>
<L>Tho wealth awaits thee, with o'erflowing hand,</L>
<L>And fame proclaims thy honours thro the land:</L>
<L>Tho power, and ease, and every gay delight,</L>
<L>Flatters thy fancy, e'en from morn to night:</L>
<L>Tho pleasure woos thee with delusive charms,</L>
<L>And binds in silken bands, thy manly arms:</L>
<L>Tho heald &amp; strength, their better blessings grant,</L>
<L>And thou hast all a happy man can want;</L>
<L>Full soon must all these summer-birds be gone,</L>
<L>Take to their wings and leave thee every one.</L>
<L>Not a day pieces, not a wind that blows,</L>
<L>A wave that's ebbing, nor a tide that flows,</L>
<L>But bears away some transitory joy,</L>
<L>Some darling hope, or visionary toy,</L>
<L>Which fancy form'd, or friendship taught to charm,</L>
<L>Or nature fondled with embraces warm.</L>
<L>This the best state the sons of earth can boast,</L>
<L>To see, by slow degrees, their glories lost.</L>
<L>Yet not to all the mild gradation's given,</L>
<L>Thro' the high wisdom of all-righteous heaven:</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="035029_0011_0FFFEEA82CBF7990"/>
Oft is the pitying eye distrest to see,</L>
<L>The man who grew, and flourish'd like a tree,</L>
<L>With all his blooming honours thick around,</L>
<L>Vig'rous and fair, the pride of all the ground,</L>
<L>By some swift blast of bleak Misfortune's air</L>
<L>Stript all at once—an object of despair.</L>
<L>Or grant the blessings, boast a longer date,</L>
<L>And more remote the period fix'd by fate:</L>
<L>Such is the state of sublunary joy,</L>
<L>The mere possessing does the bliss destroy.</L>
<L>The pride of nature still its frailty bears,</L>
<L>And fortune's favours ever bring their cares.</L>
<L>Health in continuance, loses half its charms,</L>
<L>And smiling pleasure dies within your arms.</L>
<L>Fame, wealth, and power, and much invited ease,</L>
<L>False to their promise, pain you more than please;</L>
<L>E'en human virtue but aspires to sigh,</L>
<L>By sad experience taught the reason why.</L>
<L>Bliss is a dream, and life a fleeting shade,</L>
<L>Bedeck'd with flowers that in an instant fade.</L>
<L>Earth's hopes are bubbles, bursting ere they fall,</L>
<L>And vanity of vaniteis is all.</L>
<L>Yet, there's a power, who thro' this sinking scene,</L>
<L>Can keep the soul unshaken and serene;</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="035029_0012_0FFFEEA9D77CF850"/>
Can sweeten every blessing to the taste,</L>
<L>And make amends for all that time can waste;</L>
<L>Whose providence our glory can advance,</L>
<L>From every ill we call the work of chance;</L>
<L>Can set us free, amidst a land of slaves,</L>
<L>Or lead us safely o'er assliction's waves,</L>
<L>And plant our feet upon a happier shore,</L>
<L>Where chance, &amp; time, &amp; death, shall be no more</L>
<L>Ye, who in search of WISDOM travel far,</L>
<L>Under the guidance of that glorious star,</L>
<L>That shone o'er Bethle'em, when the seers of old</L>
<L>The joyful tidings of Emanuel told;</L>
<L>And ye who come, all curious to inquire,</L>
<L>Like Sheba's queen, to hear, and to admire;</L>
<L>And you, sweet mourners, who in silence sit,</L>
<L>Weeping for sins ye-know not to commit;</L>
<L>Whose tuneful harps, upon the willows hung,</L>
<L>Had better grac'd the praise the muse has sung.</L>
<L>Come, ever gentle spirits, haste along,</L>
<L>Breathe through the verse, and animate the song,</L>
<L>While I to WISDOM'S sacred sane repair,</L>
<L>And thence invoke the oracle by prayer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh thou! who ever wast, and wilt be still,</L>
<L>The sole great arbitress of good and ill:</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="035029_0012_0FFFEEA9D77CF850"/>
Whose full perfection dwells with God alone,</L>
<L>Ador'd by every angel round his throne:</L>
<L>Who all that passes canst minutely tell,</L>
<L>From highest heaven, down to the deepest hell:</L>
<L>Descend, bright guardian of our better parts,</L>
<L>Maintain thy grand tribunal in our hearts:</L>
<L>Renew thy gracious visits every hour,</L>
<L>And grant some emanations of thy power</L>
<L>To shine thro all thy spirits, and afford</L>
<L>Light to our darkness: speak thou but the word—</L>
<L>'Let there be light,'—and light will instant shine,</L>
<L>And feeble mortals feel the ray divine.</L>
<L>Whether in pleasure's flowery paths we stray,</L>
<L>Or sorrowing, tread affliction's thorny way;</L>
<L>Whether our barks, on life's deceitful seas,</L>
<L>Are tempest tost, or careless drive at ease.</L>
<L>In every trial keep us safe from harm,</L>
<L>Guard us becalm'd, and guide us in the storm:</L>
<L>Confirm that knowledge, which thy grace decrees,</L>
<L>Strengthen that faith, which shakes at every breeze;</L>
<L>Raise and ennoble every thought confined,</L>
<L>And pour instruction o'er the darken'd mind:</L>
<L>Wake into light the truths that lie concealed,</L>
<L>And, in thy own bright beauty, stand revealed:</L>
<L>By charm'd attention, woo us to thy praise:</L>
<L>Win us, and wed us firmly to thy ways:</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="035029_0013_0FFFEEAD575C6090"/>
To thee alone make all our wishes tend,</L>
<L>Our comfort now, our glory in the end.</L>
<L>'Tis thou alone canst fit us to fulfil</L>
<L>Thy sacred laws, and judge of good and ill:</L>
<L>'Tis thou alone canst teach us to decide</L>
<L>'Twixt virtue's nobler aims, and human pride:</L>
<L>Canst reach, with irresistible controul,</L>
<L>Thro nature's finest feelings to the soul,</L>
<L>And make the tender mother, in the strife,</L>
<L>Forego her darling child to save his life.</L>
<L>To thee in deep humility we bend,</L>
<L>The rich man's ornament, the poor man's friend,</L>
<L>The good man's monitor, the pilgrim's guide,</L>
<L>The mourner's comfort, and the sage's pride;</L>
<L>The christian's lamp, the saint's supreme desire,</L>
<L>The prophet's spirit, and the seraph's fire!</L>
<L>Daughter of heaven, who reign'st thro earth &amp; seas,</L>
<L>And air, and skies: Whose beauty, order, ease,</L>
<L>Shines forth in all: Complete the glorious plan,</L>
<L>And sway thy sceptre in the heart of man.</L>
<L>Tho at thy awful tasks we shrink dismay'd,</L>
<L>Spare not, but be thy high behests obeyed.</L>
<L>If at thy bidding, through the deeps we go,</L>
<L>Or wander in a wilderness of woe,</L>
<L>Eternal WISDOM, grant us thy supplies;</L>
<L>('Tis all we ask) oh, teach us to be wise!</L>
