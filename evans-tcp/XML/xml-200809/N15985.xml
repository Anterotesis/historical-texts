<L>WHEN SALLY was little, she liv'd in a cot,</L>
<L>With her father, and mother, and aunt;</L>
<L>And tho', as it seems, they no riches had got,</L>
<L>Yet their darling did never know want.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="2">
<PB N="15" REF="020461_0009_0FAF0A790A07F288"/>
<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>When SALLY grew bigger she went to a school,</L>
<L>And there, as her play-fellows tell,</L>
<L>She minded her learning, observ'd ev'ry rule,</L>
<L>For a while not a girl did so well.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>She was notic'd by many.—A gay lady fair,</L>
<L>Once took her with kindest intent;</L>
<L>She made the young SALLY her principal care,</L>
<L>And took her wherever she went.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<PB N="16" REF="020461_0010_0FAF0A7BB34D2DC0"/>
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>Now while SALLY was good she liv'd like a queen;</L>
<L>What a pity she does not so still!</L>
<L>But with sad wicked children at last she was seen,</L>
<L>And she'll go with them, say what you will.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>'T was this made the lady young SALLY forsake,</L>
<L>No more would she act a friend's part,</L>

<L>And, if she don't mend in her ways,</L>
<L>By her obstinate folly to ruin she'll fall,</L>
<L>Tho' once she had ev'ry one's praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>Then think of young SALLY; take warning betimes,</L>

<L>And certainly fall in a snare.</L>

<L>No flow'r that adorns the gay green,</L>

<L>And <HI>godness</HI> alone has the pow'r,</L>
<L>To give us true comfort and joy.</L>

<L>Then in search of soft pleasures, my dear,</L>
<L>As along life's gay stream you are borne,</L>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>READ o'er these pleasing lines with care, my dear,</L>
<L>For you alone are they inserted here;</L>
<L>Songs wrote to please you, tales for you design'd,</L>
<L>Both to divert you, and improve your mind.</L>
<L>Whatever you in earliest days are taught,</L>
<L><PB N="119" REF="020461_0061_0FAF117F789703C8"/>Is thus, by care, to just perfection brought;</L>
<L>Yet still <HI>amusement</HI> we shall here be∣stow,</L>
<L>For with amusement should in∣struction go.</L>
<L>Our verses are contriv'd for ev'ry ear,</L>
<L>And you must understand them when you hear:</L>
<L>Then to our rhymes a pleas'd at∣tention give,</L>
<L>And you will taste their profits while you live.</L>
<L>To <HI>little ones</HI> our rhymes are now address'd,</L>
<L>Great ones <HI>may profit by the truths express'd.</HI></L>
<L>Then let not any thing prevent your claim,</L>
<L><PB N="120" REF="020461_0062_0FAF1180355CB0B8"/>To take what leads you still to worth and fame.</L>
<L>In every line a moral fair is shewn,</L>
<L>Children may make that moral still their own;</L>
<L>And, if they take it, shall in future days,</L>
<L>Succeed to wealth, to happiness, and praise.</L>
