<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>I Shall not make any <HI>Apology</HI> for the Plainess of the Style in the <HI>Sermons</HI> Emitted here∣with, Much less for my ha∣ving Confirmed the doc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> insisted on, with <HI>Scriptural De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦strations,</HI> that having alwayes b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and ever shall be, Studiou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> deavoured by me.</P>
<P>There are Preachers in the World, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have little Citation of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ture their Discourses, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are Studied <HI>Harangues,</HI> Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to please the Phantasies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> awaken the Consciences of the
<PB N="ii" REF="001767_0003_0FB8235E6165FCE0"/>
Auditors. No Man of those few in the World to whom I am known, will Expect any thing of that Na∣ture from me. I bless the Lord that in my Youth I did not so, be∣cause of the fear of God, but have been willing to follow that Aposto∣lical Precept, <HI>in Doctrine to shew In∣corruptness, Gravity, Sincerity and sound Speech which cannot be con∣demned.</HI> Much more does it be∣come me to do so in my Old Age. I am grieved to see in a late Book which gives an Account of <HI>the pre∣sent State of the Dissenters,</HI> Com∣plaints, that many Ministers in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> among those that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o under the Name of <HI>Dissenters,</HI> are got into a <HI>Modish Way of Preaching</HI>; and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so they might be thought to be florid, they affect a <HI>Dramatick</HI> Style in their Sermons, and bring out Play house Phrases into the Language of the Pulpit. That
<PB N="iii" REF="001767_0004_0FB823602929DB68"/>
Writer says, that Mr. <HI>Alsop</HI> (my worthy dear Friend, now among the Spirits of just Men made per∣fect) when a Young Man Preach'd after the <HI>Modish Fashion,</HI> some com∣mending his Sermon for a <HI>Fine Dis∣course,</HI> in a just Indignation replyed, It was a <HI>Sermon for the Devil,</HI> for the Devil is pleased and God is offended with such Discourses in the Pulpit. A Learned Writer says of an Epistle, <HI>Ornamentum est Orna∣mentis Car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re.</HI> It may much more be said so of a Sermon. Painting Serious Truths, spoyles their Effi∣cacy. <HI>Quo imperitior Sermo, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> illustrior Ratio est,</HI> said one of the Ancients.</P>
<P>In one of the Subsequent Dis∣courses, the Immortality of the Soul, and a Future State after Death is asserted: Which is a Truth that may be known by the Light of
<PB N="iv" REF="001767_0005_0FB82361B9090F18"/>
Nature, without Scripture Revela∣tion. Some Philosophers (the <HI>Platonicks</HI> especially) have believed it; <HI>Plato</HI> having taught that when Men dye their Souls pass through the Air to Eternal Mansions, and he says, some have been restrained from wicked Practices, because they were Convinced of a Future Re∣compence in another World. It is reported, that one having read what that Philosopher has Written concerning the Immortality of the Soul, was so affected with it, as to profess that he had rather suffer Death, than do a wicked thing. How inexcusable then will those Christians be that Live Ungodly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when they have the clear lig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Scripture, to make known unto them, what will become of their Immortal Souls, when by Death separated from their Bodies, and they gone into ETERNITY;
<PB N="v" REF="001767_0006_0FB823669DFBE740"/>
And what Consolation must it needs afford to godly Souls, to be assured, that Holy Angels will be sent from Heaven, to Conduct them to Glory. There was a Book Printed at <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> (1701.) being a <HI>Discourse Concerning Angels.</HI> It is a very Ju∣dicious and Solid Treatise: The Authors Name is not prefixed; but the Bookseller (Mr. <HI>Parkhurst</HI>) has informed me that Mr. <HI>Saunders</HI> an Eminent Minister in <HI>Devon,</HI> wrote it. The Reader may find this Truth confirmed by that Author, as well as by many others, who Treat of <HI>Angels</HI></P>
<P>If any would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e more, concer∣ning the Elect being called, some at one Age, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me at Another, they may cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t an Excellent Ser∣mon (all his are Excellent) of out famous Mr. <HI>Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ker,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="001767_0007_0FB82368DF349DF0"/>The two first of these Sermons (altho' last Preached) are concer∣ning <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as a <HI>Mighty Savi∣our.</HI> As I begun my Ministry Eight and Fifty Years ago, with Preaching <HI>Christ,</HI> so would I con∣clude it with Preaching Him. And the rather, because I see but little of <HI>Christ,</HI> in most of those Sermons which have of later Years been Pub∣lished. Such Discourses are al∣wayes seasonable, but they are so in a special manner, when there are Books Printed in which <HI>Arianism</HI> and <HI>Socinianism</HI> is contended for. It is a Marvellous thing, that Men who read the Scriptures &amp; pretend to Believe them, should Question whether <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is the <HI>True God,</HI> when there are no less than Fourteen Names or <HI>Appellations</HI> given to Him in the Scriptures, every one of which does declare his <HI>Deity,</HI> as <HI>Glassius</HI> has observed. They that trust in one,
<PB N="vii" REF="001767_0008_0FB8236A6B334BB0"/>
that is a Man only, for Salvation, Cursed is their Faith. <HI>Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm.</HI></P>
<P>It might be expected, or how∣ever, I my self might expect, that one who has (through the Patience and goodness of God) arrived to my Age, should be dismiss'd from Publick Labour, and enjoy rest in his Old Age, spending the remainder of his few dayes in Reading, and in Contemplations on another World. I cannot charge my self with having been altogether Idle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Younger Years, and now when Age has ren∣dred me uncapable of doing as once I could, why may I not plead the Priviledge of <HI>Miles Emeritus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>?</HI> Neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>less, the wonderful Mercy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for which I ought every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> less his Name) having con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to me a greater Measure of

Ability for Service, than is com∣monly seen in Men of my Years, shall I not according to my poor Ability endeavour to bring forth Fruit in Old Age, and such Fruit as shall remain, when I can neither Write nor Speak any more? Let Death find me so doing.</P>
<P>I must acknowledge, that I have been incouraged by Letters, which several whom I have reason to re∣spect, have sent to me, desiring that I would Preach seldom, but Tran∣scribe more of my Discourses for the Press, because (they tell me) God has blessed those formerly Publish∣ed for Good to many, in remoter Parts of the Country, who never had any Opportunity to hear me Speaking in the Name of the Lord. It is from free Infinite Grace, if it has been so.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="001767_0010_0FB8281E1D0CC098"/>It has been in my thoughts, to Write something concerning <HI>Old Age.</HI> Why may it not be proper for One that is past Seventy Six, to Miditate on such a Subject? Also, Concerning <HI>the Duty of Observing Divine Providences,</HI> in which I would take Notice of the singular and signal Providence of God over His Church, and over the English Nation, and in special over <HI>New-England,</HI> and this Populous Town of <HI>Boston.</HI> There have been many Remarkable Occurrences which ought not to be forgotten by us. <HI>The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.</HI></P>
<P>These things (with some other) have been in my heart to do, if the God of my Life shall lengthen my days. But it is probable that a

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>Isaiah LXIII. 1.</BIBL>
<P>— <HI>Mighty to Save.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> be∣ing in an <HI>Ecstasy,</HI> had a Vision of a glorious Conqueror. (1) He speaks of the Enemies that were subdued and destroyed by him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The <HI>Edomites. Edom</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> mentioned. <HI>Edom</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ites</HI> the Posterity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Edom.

<PB N="2" REF="001767_0015_0FB82827DC261DA0"/>
Capital City belonging to the Edo∣mites: These are mentioned because they were next Neighbours to the Children of Israel, and the most inve∣terate, and implacable, and are by a <HI>Synechdoche,</HI> put for all the implacable Enemies of the People of God. (2) The Prophet gives a description of the Conqueror which he had a Vi∣sion of. He is described. [1.] From his Garments and Apparel: His <HI>Gar∣ments</HI> were <HI>dyed, viz.</HI> dyed with the blood of his Enemies over whom he was Victorious, and therefore in the next <HI>Verse</HI> 'tis said, He was <HI>red in his Apparel:</HI> He is also described as <HI>Glori∣ous in his Apparel;</HI> for so great Gene∣rals and Conquerors are wont to be, especially when they have been Victo∣rious. [2.] From the manner of his Marching along: He walked in State. <HI>Travelling in the greatness of his Strength.</HI> As a Lion that knows the greatness of his Strength, walks along in a state∣ly manner. Thus is the <HI>Conqueror</HI> whom the Prophet had a Vision of described.</P>
<P>In this Verse, we have a Question,
<PB N="3" REF="001767_0016_0FB8282B69AEB338"/>
and the Answer to it. The Prophet propounds the Question, <HI>Who is this?</HI> This wonderful Conqueror that comes thus gloriously arayed, who is it? Christ Answers, <HI>It is I.</HI> In his Answer he gives a description of himself. (1.) From his Fidelity: <HI>I that speak in Righteousness</HI>: What he speaks, he does faithfully perform. He is always as good as his Word. He has promised Salvation to his People, and he does accomplish it: He has threatned Destruction to his implacable Enemies, and he does accomplish that also, and is <HI>Righteous</HI> therein. (2.) From his Power and Ability: <HI>He is Mighty to Save.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctrine to be insisted on, is,

<P>For the Opening and Confirming the Truth before us, we shall.</P>
<P N="1">1. Shew, How it does appear that Christ is a Mighty Saviour.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="001767_0017_0FB8282F5FA349F8"/>2. Who are the Subjects of that Salvation, which this Mighty Saviour is the Author of.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>How does it appear that Jesus Christ is a Mighty Saviour?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. 1. <HI>The Scripture does abundant∣ly declare this.</HI> The great design of the Book of God is to make known unto Men that there is a Saviour for them, and that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is He. We find in the Gospel, that Angels from Heaven have Preached this Doctrine. Luk. 2.10, 11. <HI>The Angel said, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all People, for unto you is born this day a Saviour which is Christ the Lord.</HI> And there was a great Mul∣titude of the Heavenly Host, Praising God for it. The Names whereby Christ is called in the Scripture de∣notes His being a Saviour. The Name of <HI>Shil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> is given to Him, <HI>Gen.</HI> 49.10 Which imports His being a Saviour, and a Great <HI>Peace giver.</HI> The
<PB N="5" REF="001767_0018_0FB82830DC6DFC10"/>
Latin Word <HI>Salus</HI> which signifies <HI>Sal∣vation,</HI> is supposed to come from the Hebrew <HI>Shilo.</HI> And the Name of <HI>Jesus</HI> is given to Him. The Angel gave this Reason, why he should be called by that Name, Mat. 1.21. <HI>Thou shalt call His Name</HI> Jesus, <HI>for He shall</HI> Save <HI>His People from their Sins</HI>▪ He is in the Scripture called <HI>Salvation</HI> it self, which imports his being a Sa∣viour in the highest Degree. As soon as <HI>Simeon</HI> had seen <HI>the Lords Christ,</HI> he sayes, <HI>Mine eyes have seen Thy Salvation,</HI> Luk. 2.30. It was said, <HI>Salvation is of the Jews,</HI> because Christ w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them, <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.22. The Scripture call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Him <HI>a Great Saviour,</HI> Isai. 19.20. Whoever might be Firstly and Typi∣cally meant, Christ is the <HI>Saviour</HI> and the <HI>Great One</HI> there Chiefly intended. And not only in the Text before us, but in other Scriptures, He is said to be <HI>Mighty.</HI> Psa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 24.8 Who is the King of Glory? <HI>The Lord Strong and Mighty, The Lord Mighty in Battel.</HI> 45.3. <HI>Gird thy Sword upon thy Thigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> O <HI>Mighty.</HI> And 89.19. <HI>I have laid

help on One that is Mighty.</HI> It is meant of Christ Eminently.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Jesus Christ is the Mighty God.</HI> And therefore He is a Mighty Savi∣our. Very often in the Scripture, He is said to be God; and we may not think that he is so in respect of His Office or Authority only, as <HI>Princes</HI> are said to be <HI>Gods,</HI> but in res∣pect of Nature, He is called <HI>The Migh∣ty God,</HI> Isai. 9.6. <HI>Unto us a Child is Born, a Son is given, His Name shall be called,</HI> that is he shall be, <HI>The Mighty God.</HI> And he is said to be <HI>The Great God.</HI> Tit. 2.13. <HI>The glorious appearing of the Great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI> He then is not only a <HI>Migh∣ty</HI> but an <HI>Almighty Saviour.</HI> We all need such Salvations as no Creature, yea, as all the Creatures in the World cannot help us unto. But Christ has a Mighty Arm able to Save us, Isai. 59.1. <HI>Behold, the Lords Hand is not shortened that it cannot save</HI> Christ is that God which made the World. All things were made by Him, and

counted worthy of more glory than Moses.</HI> Moses did by Divine Appointment introduce a new Religion into the World, so did Christ, and in that re∣spect was like unto Moses. No Man was ever admitted to such familiarity with God, as was Moses, but Christ much more. <HI>The Law was given by Moses, Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ. No man hath seen God at any time,</HI> no not Moses himself so as Christ has, <HI>the only begotten Son which is in the Bosome of the Father He hath declared Him,</HI> Joh. 1.17, 18. Moses was a shadow of Christ. The shadow re∣presents the Body whose shadow it is, so in Moses we see some Represen∣tation of Christ shadowed to us. He was a <HI>Deliverer,</HI> but not comparable to Christ. The <HI>Judges</HI> in Israel were Saviours, and on that account Types of Christ.

<P N="4">4. <HI>Jesus Christ is a Mighty Saviour in respect of the Multitude of Subjects which are saved by him.</HI> There are a World of them. Joh. 4.42. <HI>This is in∣deed the Christ the Saviour of the World.</HI> No Saviour that ever was in the World, saved so many as Christ has done. <HI>Cyrus</HI> was an instrument in the hand of God, to accomplish a great Tem∣poral Salvation for a whole Nation. He set at liberty Nine and forty thou∣sand Captives at once, <HI>Ezra</HI> 2.64. But Jesus Christ has saved a far greater

Number of the Captives of Hell; He is a Saviour not only of Jews, but of Gentiles dispersed throughout the World. Wherefore the Apostle says, 1 Joh. 2.2. <HI>He is a Propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only.</HI> Not for ours only who are Jews, <HI>but also of the whole World;</HI> meaning the Gentile World: Great Numbers among the Jews have been saved by Christ: In the Apostles days, there were <HI>Myriads</HI> of them. Act. 21.20. <HI>Many thousands of Jews believe</HI>: but far more thou∣sands of that People shall ere long believe on Christ, and so become the Subjects of his Salvation. It is sup∣posed by some Learned Men, that if the Jews which are scattered over the face of the whole Earth, were gathe∣red together, they would be the most Numerous Nation in the World: but this Nation shall turn to the Lord, and then all Israel shall be Saved. But among the Gentiles Christ has had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r more Subjects than among the Jews. Many Millions of them have been Converted to Christ, and Saved

by him. And among the Gentiles also, there are whole Nations that shall ere long become Christs Subjects. He will be their King, and he will Save them. <HI>All the Ends of the World shall turn to the Lord.</HI> The Lord shall be King over all the Earth; <HI>In that day shall there be One Lord and his Name One,</HI> Zech. 14.9. Then all the World will see and know and believe that Jesus Christ is a Mighty Saviour. His Elect, altho' they are but few com∣pared with the Reprobate World, Ne∣vertheless, in themselves considered they are a Mighty Number, and all Saved by Christ. Rev. 7.9. <HI>I beheld a great Multitude which no Man could Number, of all Nations, and Kindreds, and Tongues, clothed with white Robe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> They had never had those Robes of Salva∣tion given to them, if it had not been for Jesus Christ. Well might the Angel say that Christs coming into World was matter of great Joy <HI>to all People,</HI> Luk. 2.10.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="12" REF="001767_0025_0FB8283F03729D38"/>5. <HI>Jesus Christ is a Saviour of Souls,</HI> and therefore a Mighty Saviour. He is called the <HI>Shepherd of Souls,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.25. Sin has brought death not only on the Bodies of Men, but on their Souls. Ezek. 18.4. <HI>The soul that sinneth shall dy.</HI> And a woful death it is that Sin brings on the Souls of Men. In∣deed the Soul does not dy a natural death as the Body does, but it may be a subject of great wo and misery, and that's death. Isal. 3.9. <HI>They declare their sin as Sodom, wo to their soul.</HI> But Jesus Christ saves both Soul &amp; Body. Who is able to redeem a Body that is dead from the Power of the Grave? Jesus Christ the Son of God can do it, has done it, and will do it. Joh. 5.25. <HI>Verily, I say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.</HI> But to quicken and save a Soul that has been dead in Trespasses and Sins, is a Mightier work, than to raise all the dead Bodies in the World, yet this Jesus Christ has Power to do.
<PB N="13" REF="001767_0026_0FB82840B42BFCD0"/>
Therefore he says, Isai. 55.3. <HI>Come unto me, hear, and your souls shall live.</HI> Christ has redeemed Souls as well as Bodies by a <HI>Mighty Price.</HI> 1 Cor. 6.20. <HI>You are bought with a price, therefore glo∣rify God in your body, and in your spirit.</HI> And what it that price, which has bought both Body and Spirit? It is the price of blood, and the most pre∣cious blood that ever was, or that pos∣sibly can be, the blood of <HI>Christ</HI> which is <HI>the blood of God.</HI> And as Christ has saved the Souls of his People by <HI>Price,</HI> so likewise by <HI>Power.</HI> His <HI>All-powerful Arm</HI> has vanquished all the Powers of darkness. Col. 2.15. <HI>Having spoiled Principalities and Powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them.</HI> He has led Captivity Captive: He has dis-armed the Devil and all his Angels and as it were tied them to his triumphal Chariot, and exposed them openly in the sight of Heaven and Earth: So has he set the Souls that were the Captives of Hell at Li∣berty. The Salvation of a Soul is a Mighty thing. It is so, considering
<PB N="14" REF="001767_0027_0FB828424FD2EF10"/>
the worth of the Soul: One Soul is more worth than all this World. Has not Christ said, <HI>What is a man profited, if he gain the whole World, and loose his own soul? or; what shall a man give in exchange for his soul</HI>? Mat. 16.26. A Scripture which a Religious Man advised a King that he would think on it, a quarter of an hour every day, The Soul is of invaluable worth, con∣sidering the Immortality of it. Every Man has a Mortal Body, and an Im∣mortal Soul: A body that must dy, and shall dy, and a Soul that shall ne∣ver dy. To Save such a Soul is a Mightier thing than to save all the Bodies in the World. To redeem one Soul is such a Mighty thing, as that all the Men on Earth, and all the An∣gels in Heaven cannot do it. Psal. 49.8. <HI>The redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever.</HI> But what a Mighty Saviour then is Jesus Christ, who has Redeemed Thousands of Millions of Precious and Immortal Souls?</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="15" REF="001767_0028_0FB828439C0E30A0"/>6. <HI>Christ Saves his People from the Mightiest Enemies, and from the greatest Evils,</HI> therefore he is <HI>Mighty to Save.</HI> The Miserable Captives of Hell were in woful slavery under Mighty Op∣pressors. The Almighty Lord Jesus Christ has set th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at Liberty. Isai. 49.24, 25. <HI>Shall the prey be taken from the Mighty, or the lawful Captive be deli∣vered? The Captives of the Mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible ones shall be delivered.</HI> Sinners are said to be lawful Captives, in that the Justice of God had delivered them in∣to the hands of Satan, and his evil An∣gels, who were <HI>terrible Ones.</HI> They had never been delivered from those terrible Ones, nor the prey taken out of the hands of the Mighty, if Christ had not done it. <HI>Satan</HI> is a powerful Enemy; the Scripture speaks of the power of that Enemy, <HI>Luk.</HI> 10.19. But this <HI>Conqueror</HI> whom the Text speaks of, has Conquered the Devil, and ta∣ken his armour from him, in which he trusted. Heb. 2.14. <HI>He has destroyed
<PB N="16" REF="001767_0029_0FB82846F9E6FB98"/>
him that had the power of death that is the Devil;</HI> not as to his Being, but as to his Dominion. We find in the Gos∣pel, that Christ delivered many that were under bodily Possession by De∣vils, thereby declaring that he would deliver Souls that were under Spiritual Possession by Evil Spirits. Spiritual Plagues are the greatest, therefore de∣liverance from them is a <HI>Mighty Sal∣vation.</HI> Blindness of Mind is a Spiri∣tual Judgment. Sin and Satan has blinded the Minds of Men. 2 Cor. 4.4. <HI>The God of this World has blinded the Eyes of them that believe not.</HI> Jesus Christ saveth from this Spiritual Judg∣ment. For one that is blind to have his sight restored to him is a Mighty thing especially if he was born blind. Joh. 9.32. <HI>Since the World began was it not heard, that any man opened the Eyes of one that was born blind</HI>: But Christ has opened the Eyes of many a one that was born blind; that came into the World with a dark Soul. To give sight to a dark Soul, is a greater thing than to restore sight to a dark Body:
<PB N="17" REF="001767_0030_0FB828481F01AAF8"/>
But to how many Thousands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Christ done this? He was sent to Preach Deliverance to the Captives, and <HI>recovering of sight to the Blind,</HI> Luk. 4.18. Again, <HI>Hardness of Heart</HI> is a Spiritual Judgment; No Plague on <HI>Pharaoh</HI> was so great as that of the Hardness of his Heart. Who can deliver from this Evil? Who can turn an Heart of Stone into an Heart of Flesh? Can any Creature do it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> No, but <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> can do it. Ma∣ny a Rocky Heart, that has been as Hard as an Adamant Stone, He has broken it, and then healed it. <HI>He was sent to bind up the broken hearted,</HI> Isa. 61.1. Deliverance from the second Death is a mighty Salvation. There are some concerning whom it is said, <HI>Of such the second Death hath no power,</HI> Rev. 20.6. There is a <HI>first Death,</HI> which is a Death of the Body, no Man is exempted from that: <HI>What Man is there that lives, and shall not see Death.</HI> The <HI>second Death</HI> is that which follows upon the first, as to the Soul of the Sinner, immediately upon its

separation from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy and of both Soul and Body in Hell after the day of Judgment, a part in that Lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second death. This is that which Sinners are condemned unto. If it had not been for Jesus Christ, no Sinner in the World had been delivered from that terrible death: But Jesus Christ the Son of God has saved a World of Perishing Souls from it. Joh. 3.17. <HI>God sent not his son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be saved.</HI> The most formidable Thing that can possibly be thought on, is the Wrath of the Infinite God. Who can save from it? It is too mighty for any Creature in Heaven or Earth to undertake. Who can quench that Devouring Fire? Christ has done it with his own Blood. <HI>Be∣ing Justified by his Blood, we shall he sa∣ved from Wrath through him,</HI> Rom 5.9. It is a <HI>Wrath to come,</HI> and will be Eter∣nally coming. But <HI>Jesus has delivered us from the Wrath to come,</HI> 1 Thes. 1.10.
<PB N="19" REF="001767_0032_0FB8284B1BF41CD8"/>
And this He does by saving from Sin. Mat. 1.21. <HI>Thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his People from their sins.</HI> It is Sin that has caused the Displeasure of God against a sin∣ful sinning World, and caused his Wrath to burn to the bottom of Hell. Christ by saving from Sin, has saved from Wrath, and from all the dread∣ful direful Effects of that Wrath. Sin is the greatest Evil. He that saves from the greatest Evil is the greatest Saviour. Other Evils other Saviours may possibly deliver from, but Sin is that Evil which none but Christ can save from.</P>

Acts 4.12. <HI>There is none other Name un∣der Heaven, given among Men, where∣by we must be saved.</HI> They that will not own him shall Perish Eternally. Christ therefore said to the Jews, <HI>If you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins,</HI> Joh. 8.24. He is not on∣ly a Saviour, but <HI>the</HI> Saviour, impor∣ting that he <HI>only</HI> is so. Phil. 3.20. <HI>Our Conversation is in Heaven from whence we look for</HI> the <HI>Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> And as Christ, and no one else is the Saviour of the World, there is one God, and one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus, so he is such an one by himself <HI>alone,</HI> without the assistance of any Creature. Temporal Saviours have had many to assist them, or they could have done nothing. But Christ had no Man to assist him in the mighty Work of our Redemption. Isa. 9.16. <HI>He saw that there was no man, therefore His own arm brought Sal∣vation to Him.</HI> In making satisfacti∣on

for the sins of his People, none joyned with him. The high Priest went <HI>alone</HI> into the Sanctuary, <HI>not with∣out Blood,</HI> Heb. 9.7. By that signifying, that Christ <HI>alone</HI> by his Blood, has made Atonement for the sins of his People. No one else did in the least contribute towards that Salvation. Nor did any Man help him in con∣quering the Enemies of our Salvation. He says in the Context before us, Isa. 63.3. <HI>I have troden the wine Press a∣lone, and of the People there was none with me, I looked, and there was none to help.</HI> Hence it is said of Christ, that he <HI>saves to the uttermost,</HI> Heb. 7.25. For that he has not left any part of our Salvation to be accomplish'd by ano∣ther, but he has done it all by himself alone. We see that Jesus Christ is a Mighty Saviour.</P>
<P>We proceed to the Second Enqui∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="23" REF="001767_0036_0FB82855C76DA068"/>Take the Answer in Three Parti∣culars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Fallen sinful Man is the Objects of Christ's Salvation.</HI> There is a World of Fallen Angels which kept ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their first Estate; they are in Chain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Everlasting Darkness. Christ is not a Saviour to them. The Son of God took not on him the Nature of Angels, but He assumed the Nature of Man, and is therefore a Saviour not of An∣gels that have sinned, but of Men that have sinned. And His Salvation does extend to all sorts of sinful Men High and Low, Rich and Poor. Where∣fore it is said, <HI>God our Saviour will have all Men,</HI> (meaning some of all sorts of Men) <HI>to be saved,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tim. 2.4. There is not a Man in the World, but what needs a Saviour. For all Men are sinners. God in His holy Word de∣clares that they are so.

need a Saviour. When the Pharisees said to the Disciples, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Eateth your Master with Publicans and Sinners, Jesus said to them, <HI>The whole have no need of a Physician but the sick. I am not come to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance,</HI> Mat. 9.12, 13. Men have gone astray in the way of sin. They are lost, their Souls are lost, in a woful Wilderness of sin &amp; misery. But that <HI>Son of Man</HI> who is also the Son of God, <HI>came to seek and to save that which was lost,</HI> Luk. 19.10. The most wretched and forlorn sinners in the World, are not excluded from partaking in His Salvation. For unto such He does offer it, in the Gospel. <HI>To the Poor, the Maimed, the Halt, and the Blind,</HI> Luk. 14.21. There are some sinners which have a greater Load of Guilt upon their Souls than others have. Christ will be a Saviour to these, if they will come to Him for His Salvation, and He bids them all come. Mat. 11.28, 29. <HI>Come unto me all you that Labour and are Heavy Laden, and you shall find rest for your souls.</HI> Who can save from the
<PB N="25" REF="001767_0038_0FB8285ADCD52638"/>
heavy Burden of the Guilt of sin? That's a Burden intollerable to be born: a Burden that has broke the Backs of Million of Angels. Christ can deliver from it, though none but an Almighty Saviour can do it. He came to Save not only Sinners, but the Chief of Sinners. Nay, such as have been guilty of all sorts of sins. We read in the Gospel: Mat. 4 23. <HI>That he healed all manner of sickness, and all manner of diseases</HI>; thereby signify∣ing that all sorts of sins, all manner of Soul-diseases should be healed by him. This notwithstanding, we may not suppose that all the Sinners in the World shall be Saved by Jesus Christ: Indeed he is able to Save them all. And there is Merit enough in his blood to make Atonement for the sins of the whole World, yea tho' there were a thousand Worlds Nevertheless, the greatest part of Men will not be Saved by him, because they will not obey him.</P>

Nothing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more natural nor more dangerous than to do so.

he accounted gain,</HI> Phil. 3.7. He made account that by this Righteousness he should gain Heaven. Is it not thus with many that go under the Name of Christians! Ask them a reason of their hope, they will presently say as the Pharisee did, I thank God I am not as many other men are, Extorti∣oners, Unjust, Adulterers; and this Morality they depend upon for Sal∣vation, especially if with a Sober Life they practise Religious Duties, they Pray and it may be Fast often; this form of Godliness they doubt not will save them. They Pray to God, they Read the Scripture, they Hear Ser∣mons in Publick Assemblies, they go to Private Meetings. All this is well done: But is Prayer, Christ? Is Reading &amp; Hearing the Word, Christ? Are Private Meetings Christ? Again, some build their hopes of Salvation on those Spiritual Priviledges which they are the Subjects of. <HI>They are baughty because of the holy mountain,</HI> Zech. 3.11.

Yet again, there are who think that because they are the Children of Godly Parents, and many Prayers have been made for them, that therefore they must needs be saved. But are thy Parents, Christ? or are their Prayers, Christ? The Jews had no words in their Mouths more frequently than <HI>Abraham Abinu,</HI> that is, Abraham is our Father: They set up <HI>Abraham</HI> in <HI>Christs</HI> Place, hoping to be saved because of their Relation to, and descent from that holy Patri∣arch. <HI>John Baptist</HI> endeavoured to Convince them of this their fatal Er∣ror.

That <HI>Mighty Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> who saveth his People with an <HI>Eternal Salvation,</HI> is easily able to accomplish <HI>Temporal Salvations</HI> for them, when and so far as he pleaseth. Oft-times he has done so when his People have been reduced to the greatest extremity. When he sees that their Power is gone, and there is none shut up and left to be a Delieverer for them, his own Arm brings Salvation. When it is with them as it was with <HI>Isaac,</HI> the Knife was just made ready to cut his Throat, then the Angel called out of Heaven, <HI>Hold thy hand,</HI> Gen. 22.11, 12. Christ was that Angel. <HI>In the Mount, the Lord will be seen.</HI> When his People are brought into a Mount of the greatest difficulty and danger, then it will be seen what God can do, and will do for them.

Jesus Christ has spoken, Mat. 10.15. <HI>Verily I say unto you, it shall be more tolle∣rable for Sodom and Gomorrah, at the day of Judgment than for that City.</HI> But some will be ready to say, <HI>Who are Christless</HI>? Do you make Infidels of us? Are we not all Christians? I Answer; We are so nominally, but are we all so really? Would to God it were so; But alas! many call them∣selves Christians, whom Christ will not own for such another day. Mat. 7.21. <HI>Not every one that sayeth unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; many will say have we not pro∣phesied in thy name, and then will I profess unto them, I never knew you.</HI> Most cer∣tain it is:</P>
<P N="1">1. That there are but few in the World that have a true saving justi∣fying Faith. Rom. 10.16. <HI>Who has be∣lieved our report.</HI> Among those that enjoy the Gospel, who has believed?

inspection, not one of an Hundred was a true Believer. But they that are <HI>Faithless</HI> are <HI>Christless.</HI> For <HI>Christ dwells in the heart by Faith,</HI> Eph. 3.17. Nor is it every kind of Faith that gi∣veth an Interest in him. It is not an Historical, or meer Doctrinal Faith, but a Faith that is attended with O∣bedience, that is saving. Jam. 2.14. <HI>What does it profit my brethren, though a man say he has faith,</HI> he does but say so, the thing is not true, <HI>and have no works, can faith save him</HI>? No, such a Faith can never save him. A true saving Faith is a working Faith. It works by Love. By Love to Christ, and Love to his People, and Love to all his Com∣mandments.</P>
<P N="2">2. As for such as live ungodly lives, Christ will not be their Saviour, if they go on in their sins. Christ came to save his People <HI>from</HI> their sins, not to save them with or <HI>in</HI> their sins. Let every one that names the Name of Christ depart from iniquity. There are Men that call themselves Christi∣ans, that live such wicked lives, that
<PB N="56" REF="001767_0069_0FB8361F269D6810"/>
Christ esteems them a dishonour to his Name. They bring a reproach on his Name. Some of the Ancients tell us, that Pagans in their dayes, would say, If Christ was a good God, they that call themselves Christians would not be such wicked Men, as we see many of them are. So tis re∣ported of the Indians, that they would not believe that Christ was a good God, because the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who pre∣tended to Worship him were the worst of Men. Alas many that call them∣selves Christians are voluptuous Per∣sons, and scandalous Worldlings. Phil. 3.18, 19. <HI>For many walk, of whom I have told you often, that they are enemies to the cross of Christ, whose end is destructi∣on, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.</HI> There are among pretended Christians, those that indulge them∣selves some in one Lust, some in ano∣ther, some in Lusts of the Flesh, others in Lusts of the Mind. Christ will own and save none of them at the last Day. <HI>But he will say, I tell you, I know you not
<PB N="57" REF="001767_0070_0FB83621C73E04E8"/>
whence you are, depart from me all ye that work iniquity,</HI> Luk. 13.27. He will say to one, thou wast a Drunkard, thou wast a worker of Iniquity, de∣part from me; He will say to another, thy life was among the Unclean, thou art a worker of Iniquity, depart from me; He will say to another, thou wast given to Lying, thou didst love and make a Lye, thou art a worker of Iniquity, depart from me. Oh that Sinners would think sadly of this, ei∣ther they must depart from all their Iniquities, or Christ will say to them at the Great Day, depart from me.</P>
<P N="3">3. They that live in disobedience to the known Commandments of Christ, have not an Interest in him. It is in vain for such to think, that this <HI>Mighty Saviour</HI> will save them. The Scrip∣ture sayes, that <HI>He is the Author of e∣ternal salvation to all them that obey him,</HI> Heb. 5.9. Then he will not be the Author of Salvation to them that con∣tinue in their disobedience to him. What then will become of Prophane Sinners, that go on in their Trepasses?
<PB N="58" REF="001767_0071_0FB83623C3C3E5D0"/>
Does not Christ in his Word say, Swear not at all? How then can any profane Swearer think that Christ will save him? Does not Christ in his Word say, Bless and Curse not? How then can they who in their rage will Curse and Damn themselves and o∣thers, think that Christ will save them from Damnation? And sins of <HI>Omission,</HI> contrary to the express commandment of Christ, may hinder Salvation as well as sins of <HI>Commission.</HI> Now say, has not Christ positively commanded Men to Pray in Secret? Mat. 6.6. <HI>When thou prayest enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy Father which is in secret.</HI> It may be the hour is yet to come, the day is yet to dawn, when thou hast done so. And are there not some who call themselves Christians, that have so little Religion in them, as not to Pray with their Families. What Lamen∣tab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Christians are they. Does not Christ by his Apostle say to Masters in Families, <HI>Continue in Prayer,</HI> Col. 4 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 2. Which words allude to the

And does not God by the Prophet awfully threaten Prayerless Families? How often have th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Words been sounding in your Ears, <HI>Pour out thy fury on the Families which call not on thy name,</HI> Jer. 10 25. How can prayerless Sinners expect Salvation from Christ, on whose Name they do not call. There is not a true Christian in the World, but he is a praying one.

Or, if their Hearts are hardened, and Conscience stupified, at their Death, to be sure at the Day of Judgment, an Interest in Christ will be valued above Crowns and Kingdoms, when Kings and Emperors, shall cry to the Rocks to fall on them, to hide them from the Wrath of the Lamb.

Two Reasons may be men∣tioned, why some of the Elect of God are Converted in their Youth.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because some of them dye in
their Youth. Therefore they must either be Converted in their Youth, or not at all. For there is no Con∣version after Death, since every Mans Eternal State is then determin'd. <HI>After Death comes Judgment,</HI> Heb. 9.27. The Immortal Soul then returns to God that gave it, and is accordingly adjudged to its Everlasting State. Some that dye in their Youth, go to Heaven when they leave this World.
<PB N="71" REF="001767_0084_0FB83641A5F27270"/>
Now the Glory of Heaven is begun in Grace. Without holiness none shall see the Lord. Wherefore it is neces∣sary that Regenerating Grace should be wrought in them, in their young Years. <HI>Jeroboam</HI> tho' a very wicked Man had a Son which was a godly Child: 2 King. 14.13. <HI>In him there was found some good thing towards the Lord God of Israel.</HI> In the 17th verse, 'tis said, <HI>The Child dyed</HI>: Since he was to dye when a Child, it was necessary that <HI>a Good Thing,</HI> that Grace should be found in him before Death took him out of the World.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some of the Elect of God are in his Eternal Purpose designed to do great Service for his Name. Most of those mentioned in the Scripture as Converted in their Youth, were in their Generation singular Instruments of Gods Glory, and of doing Service for his Name. That so Men may do Service for God, it is ordinarily requi∣site that they should have an unblemish∣ed Youth. Otherwise it is like to be with them as was Prophesied concer∣ning

But altho' he was a great Unbeliever and Persecutor, he was not guilty of such Sins as blemish a Mans Reputation in the esteem of the World. He was a very blameless Person.

It is most probable that <HI>Zacbeus,</HI> and the Jaylor, and the Thief on the Cross were in their Middle Age when Con∣verted. Such are the fittest and most capable to work in the Lords Vine∣yard, and therefore such are most commonly Called into it.

Its an easier matter to bend a young twig than an old tree: So is it an easier matter to Convert a Young Sin∣ner than an Old Sinner, which has got incurable habits of Sin, incurable by any Power less than Miraculous. Jer. 13.23. <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his skin? or the Leopard his spots, then may ye do good that are accustomed to do evil.</HI> According to humane judgment it cannot be, but with God there is no∣thing impossible.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>The Mercy of God does appear glo∣riously in the Conversion of such Sinners.</HI> Misery is the object of Mercy. When God relieves such as are extreamly Miserable his Mercy is great. Now the most miserable Creature, on the face of the whole Earth, is an Ungod∣ly Old Man. Therefore if such an one shall be Converted, Divine Mercy
<PB N="79" REF="001767_0092_0FB83653C8F5C320"/>
will be glorified. It is from Infinite Mercy that any Sinner in the World is Converted. 1 Pet. 1.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>According to his abundant Mercy be has begotten <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again:</HI> but 'tis <HI>more</HI> abundant Mercy if an Old Sinner is begotten again. When God forgives a Sinner He has Mercy on him. Wherefore <HI>David</HI> Praying for the Pardon of his sins, sayes, <HI>Have mercy upon me, O God, accor∣ding to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions,</HI> Psal. 51.1. As for one that has continued many Years in his sins, what an Infinite Number of sins has he been guilty of?

It must then proceed from free Grace and Goodness. When great Sinners are Converted, the Grace of God therein is illustrious. The <HI>Ephesians</HI> had been great Sinners: Idolaters, Magicians, and in other respects great Criminals. God Converted them, that so the riches of his Grace might be seen and admired in all succeeding Ages.

<P><HI>We are to be Cautioned against judging the Final Estate of Men,</HI> or to conclude Preremptorily that they will never be Called, because they are not Called so soon as some others have been. Suppose a Sinner to be come to his <HI>Eleventh hour,</HI> who knows but the Lord may Call him then? We are to judge nothing before the Time. Life time is a time of Mercy, until that is ended we know not what God may do for miserable sinners.

<HI>Simon Magus, Thy heart is not right in the sight of God, for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity,</HI> Act. 8.21, 23. And our Sa∣viour Christ has said, <HI>You shall know them by their fruits, do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thirstles?</HI> Mat. 7.16. If a Tree does bring forth Thorns, we may know that it is not a Vine. So if Men live ungodly lives, we may know that they have not Grace in their Souls. Hence the Apostle says, <HI>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the Devil, whosoever does not r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his Brother,</HI> 1 Joh. 3.10.

But how dost thou know thou shalt live to <HI>Old Age</HI>? Where there is one that does so, there are many that do not. Have not Deaths been multiplied among Young Per∣sons?

<PB N="86" REF="001767_0099_0FB82371AF6F5B38"/>
he that seeth into the Hearts of Men, knows when they are not sincere. Psal. 78.34. <HI>When he slew them, then they sought him, and inquired early after God. Nevertheless, they did flatter him with their mouths, and they lyed unto him with their tongue, for their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.</HI> Do we not often see it, that Sinners when they think they shall dye make great promises, that if God will spare their lives they will reform their Evil ways and yet after the Lord has mercifully spared them, they are as bad and worse than ever before. Moreover, how dost thou know that thou shalt lye on a Sick-Bed. It may be thou shalt be taken out of the World by a Sudden Death, and not have time to put up so much as One Prayer to God for the Pardon of thy sins, and the Salvation of thy Soul.

<P><PB N="87" REF="001767_0100_0FB82374C046FFC8"/><HI>Consider</HI> 1. That if Young Persons will turn to the Lord, he will surely accept of them. They that give their first fruits to God please him wonder∣fully. Prov. 8.17. <HI>They that seek me early shall find me.</HI> Wherefore whilst it is Early dayes with you, seek the Lord. You may seek Him too late: After Death has taken hold of you, it will be too late. Then although you seek him Early, you will not find him. Seek him <HI>Early in the Morning</HI> and you shall find him, but if you seek him <HI>Early in the Evening</HI> after the Eleventh hour is past, you shall not find him. Thus you may seek the Lord too late: but it is impossible for you to seek him too soon If Young Children will come to Christ, He will not re∣fuse them. He said, <HI>Suffer little Chil∣dren to come to me; and took some such into his arms and blessed them,</HI> Mar. 10.14. Were not these blessed Children thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you? To see a godly Child is a bles∣sed sight.

God, and dare not sin: How welcome are such Children to him. And if they that are past their Childhood: If Young Men will come to Christ, and to God through Jesus Christ with a Penitent heart, He has Mercy in Store for them. If a <HI>Young Ephraim</HI> is become a Penitent Ephraim, the Lord will be Merciful to him. Jer. 31.19, 20. <HI>I have heard Ephraim bemoaning himself— I smote on my thigh, I was ashamed, yea, even confounded because I did bear the re∣proach of my youth. Is Ephraim my dear son? Is he a pleasant Child, for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still; therefore my bowels are troubled for him, I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Consider</HI> 2. They that turn to God betimes, may do a great deal of Good in the World. If they come into the Lords Vineyard betimes, they may do a great deal of work there. If the Lord continue their Lives to Old Age, how many thousands of Prayers will they pour out before him, for them∣selves and others. It may be many

will be the better for them, and for their godly &amp; fruitful Conversation. There is a cursed Proverb which says, <HI>A Young Saint will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e an Old Devil</HI>; the contrary is true. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Young Saint, if the lives to be an Old Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ will be a Venerable Christian Prov. 16.31. <HI>The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Consider</HI> 3. They that turn to God in their Young Dayes will be glori∣ously rewarded in another World. All their Secret Prayers will be re∣warded. Mat. 6.6. <HI>Enter into thy closes, and when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Fa∣ther which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</HI> So concerning other works of Piety and Charity, they shall not go without a reward. Having had a long time to be working and doing good in the Lords Vineyard, all will come into the account and the reward must need be great and very glorious. <HI>Paul</HI> was Converted before he was an Old Man, and after he was set to work in the Lords Vineyard, he was

exceeding Laborious, and continued therein until he became <HI>Paul the Aged.</HI> When near his Death, he was greatly comforted in Meditating on the crown which was reserved for him. As they that have lived long in Sin, will have the greater Damnation for it, so they that have faithfully Served God for a long time, will have the greater glory.

He shewed more kindness to his dogs, than to the Poor Man, and the dogs were more friendly to him, than was their Matter.

World. Wherefore the Doctrine to be insisted on, is,
<Q><HI>DOCT.</HI> That when Godly Men dye, sup∣pose them to be never so Poor in this World, their Souls do not dye, but are carried by holy Angels into another and a better World.</Q></P>
<P>The Doctrine may be Opened and Confirmed in several <HI>Propositions.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>Every Man consists of a Body and a Soul in respect of the one of which he is subject to Death, but not in respect of the other.</HI> These are the two essential Parts of Man. It was so in the first Creation, and it is so still. The first Man consisted of a Body and a Soul: Gen 2.7. <HI>The Lord God formed Man of the dust of the Ground, &amp; breathed into his Nostrils the breath of Life, &amp; Man became a living soul.</HI> Thus does every Man consist of an humane Body, and a rational Soul. That Creature which does not so, is not one of Mankind. Math. 10, 28, <HI>Fear not them which kill
<PB N="97" REF="001767_0110_0FB823885993F940"/>
the body, but are not able to kill the soul, but rather fear him, which is able to de∣stroy both soul and body in hell.</HI> These two are of very differing nature and properties. The Body does incur the outward Senses, but the Soul does not so. The Body may be seen and felt, but the Soul cannot be so; for it is a Spiritual substance. Christ said to the Disciples when he appeared to them after his Resurrection, &amp; they thought he had been a Spirit, <HI>Handle me and see for a spirit has not flesh &amp; bones as you see me have,</HI> Luk. 24.39. The <HI>Soul</HI> is of∣ten called a <HI>Spirit.</HI> In the Scripture, Man, is distributed into <HI>Body and Soul,</HI> (as was shewed) and sometimes into <HI>Body and Spirit,</HI> 1 Cor. 6.20. It is in respect of the Body that Men dye, which is therefore called your <HI>Mortal Body,</HI> Rom. 5.14. And that being an Essential Part of Man, he is called <HI>Mortal Man,</HI> Job 4.17. Its usual a∣mong Writers to call <HI>Men</HI> by the Name of <HI>Mortals.</HI> To dye is the fate of all the Men on the Earth. Godly Men as well as others. <HI>Lazarus</HI> as well as
<PB N="98" REF="001767_0111_0FB8238C0F1D4B10"/>
<HI>Dives</HI> must see Death There's a <HI>Sta∣tutum est,</HI> a Statute Law for it: Heb. 9.27. <HI>It is app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted for men to dye.</HI> We may see the Original Statute: Gen. 3.19. <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</HI> But the Soul does not dye with the Body. Ecc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 12.7. <HI>The dust,</HI> that is the Body which was Original∣ly dust <HI>shall return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.</HI> Man is made for Eternity, and not like Inferiour Creatures, whose Sensitive Souls dye with hei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bodies. This is a truth which Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to know, yet but few know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as they should do. Wherefore <HI>Solomon</HI> sayes, <HI>Who knows the spirit of a man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth,</HI> Eccl. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.21. The Soul of Man neither shall not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an dye. All the Men in the World, are not able to kill a Soul. To deny the Immortality of the Soul, is to destroy all Religion at once. For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ullifies all the Promises &amp; Threatnings con∣tained in the Scripture, which are not fulfilled in this Life, therefore if there
<PB N="99" REF="001767_0112_0FB8238CE3435030"/>
is not a future State, and so an Immor∣tal Soul they will never be fulfilled. To say <HI>that Man is wholly Mortal,</HI> is an assertion not only contrary to the <HI>Scrip∣ture,</HI> but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the light of Natural Rea∣son. For it is irrational, to think that a Vicious Man is happier that a Ver∣tuous Man: yet so it would be, if there is no other Life but this, or if the Souls of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n dye with their Bodies. 1 Cor. 15.19. <HI>If in his life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most mi∣serable.</HI> If there is no life but this, the best Men would be the unhappiest Men. What reasonable Man can believe that to be so? Blessed Re∣wards are Promised to the Righteous; But in this life they see them not. <HI>There is one event to the Righteous and to the Wicked.</HI> Yea, many times they are subject to greater Miseries than others, and that all their life long. The holy Penman of the Seventy third Psalm, says, <HI>All the day long have I been plagued and chastened every morn∣ing.</HI> Severe punishment is threatned, for those that have been great Sinners.
<PB N="100" REF="001767_0113_0FB8238E6DD11488"/>
Whenas many times they are not pu∣nished in this World. The ungodly prosper in the World, they have more than heart can wish. From these Con∣derations the Philosophers and Wise Men among the Gentiles, did believe the Immortality of the Soul, and that there is another World in which Good Men shall be Happy, and the Wicked Miserable. <HI>Balaam</HI> was so far in∣lightned as to believe this. Where∣fore he said, <HI>Let me dye the Death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his,</HI> Numb. 23.10. He knew that when Righteous Men dye, their Souls do not dye, but that <HI>afterwards,</HI> (as the Original Hebrew imports,) after Death they are happy. And this has been the Faith of all Righteous Men. It is therefore said, <HI>The righteous has hope in his Death,</HI> Prov. 14.32. He has hope of being made happy at and by his Death. The Martyr <HI>Stephen</HI> did not think that his Soul dyed with his Body, for then he would not when dying have said, <HI>Lord Jesus receive my spirit.</HI> The Faith of this, comforted
<PB N="101" REF="001767_0114_0FB8238FDE661AC0"/>
the Martyrs, when their Persecutors threatened them with Death, they would say, kill our Bodies you may, but you shall never kill our Souls.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>When Godly Men dye, their Souls go to another and a better World.</HI> Their Souls go to that World where <HI>Abraham</HI> now is. When <HI>Lazarus</HI> died he was in <HI>Abrahams bosom.</HI> When Good Men die they are no sooner dead as to their Bodies, but they are blessed in respect of their Souls. Rev. 14.13. <HI>Blessed are the dead that dye in the Lord.</HI> When they are taken out of this World, they <HI>go to rest,</HI> they rest from their Labours, and their works follow them. This is implied by their lying in <HI>Abrahams bosom.</HI> When <HI>La∣zarus</HI> was dead, he was no more afflicted with poverty and pains. Saints de∣parted this Life, enjoy a perfect free∣dom from all evils whatsoever. Then, and not till then, will that Promise be fulfilled, Jer. 31.12. <HI>They shall not sor∣row any more at all.</HI> And which is a greater happiness, they are fully and
<PB N="102" REF="001767_0115_0FB823974A01F360"/>
forever freed from sin. Rom. 6.7. <HI>He that is dead is freed from sin.</HI> There∣fore does the Scripture speak of <HI>the spirits of just men made perfect,</HI> Heb. 12.23. They go to a place where they have nothing but comfort. When <HI>Lazarus</HI> was dead, it was said of him, <HI>Now he is comforted.</HI> Altho' their Bo∣dies are not glorified before the Re∣surrection, their Souls are as soon as they leave their Bodies. When the Cloathing of Mortality is put off, a Cloathing of Glory is put on. 2 Cor. 5.2, 3, 4 <HI>For in this we groan earnestly, desiring to be cloathed upon with our house which is from heaven, if so be that being cloathed we shall not be found naked. We that are in this tabernacle groan being bur∣dened, not for that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f life.</HI> Their Souls do not remain in a naked condition, but in∣stead of a Cloathing of Flesh, they have a Cloathing of Glory. It is said concerning the <HI>Souls under the Altar,</HI> viz The Christians that were Mar∣tyred in the Primitive times, that <HI>white
<PB N="103" REF="001767_0116_0FB82398E8BA4500"/>
robes were given to every one of them,</HI> Rev. 6.11. White Robes are an en∣sign of Glory. When the Priests were admitted into the inner Courts, <HI>White Robes</HI> were given to them. Thus the departed Souls of Believers when they first enter into the Heavenly Sanctu∣ary, <HI>Robes of Glory</HI> are given to them. They then go to a blessed place. To a place of which <HI>Paradise</HI> and the Gar∣den of <HI>Eden</HI> was a figure. It was a usual Prayer with the Jews, for an Is∣raelite, <HI>Let his soul be in the Garden of, Eden.</HI> They say, when Abraham <HI>dyed he went to Paradise,</HI> and that when Mo∣ses dyed, <HI>he went to Paradise.</HI> This is true not only of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Moses,</HI> but of all penitent Believers on Jesus Christ. It was therefore said to the Penitent on the Cross, <HI>To day thou shalt be with me in Paradise,</HI> Luk. 23.43. When they leave this World, their Souls go to Heaven. The Scripture speaks of some who <HI>Blaspheme them that dwell in heaven,</HI> Rev. 13.6. <HI>Idolatry</HI> is called <HI>Blasphemy.</HI> Papists worship Saints departed. They Pray to <HI>St.
<PB N="104" REF="001767_0117_0FB8239A5F448440"/>
Peter</HI> and <HI>St. Paul,</HI> and to the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI>; to make Gods of them is Blas∣phemy. So do they Blaspheme <HI>them that dwell in Heaven.</HI> We read of <HI>thing, in Heaven</HI> reconciled to God, <HI>Col.</HI> 1.20. The Elect Angels are in∣deed things in Heaven, they are cal∣led the <HI>Angels of Heaven,</HI> that's their Native Country▪ But they never needed to be reconciled to God, as not having sinned, nor did the Son of God shed his Blood for them. But there are <HI>Souls in Heaven,</HI> namely the Immortal Spirits of Holy Men de∣parted this life, and those are <HI>the things in Heaven,</HI> which Christ has recon∣ciled to God, by the Blood of his Cross. Good Men at their departure out of this world, go where they have blessed Communion with those holy Souls, which are gone to Heaven be∣fore them. They go to <HI>Abraham</HI> as we have shewed. It was said to <HI>A∣braham,</HI> that at his Death he should <HI>go to his Fathers,</HI> Gen. 15.15. He went to that World where <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Noah</HI> and other of his Fathers were
<PB N="105" REF="001767_0118_0FB8239BDE9E12E0"/>
gone before him. That sort of Peo∣ple which served God as he had done, at the hour of his Death he was <HI>ga∣thered to them,</HI> Gen. 25.8. They go to be with Angels. God said to the Prophet, <HI>If thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my charge, I will give thee pla∣ces to walk among these that stand by,</HI> Zech. 3 7. Were they not <HI>Angels</HI> that stood by? When the faithful Servants of God, have finished their work in this world, they go to be with Angels, and to walk with them in the walks of Heaven. They go to be <HI>with Christ.</HI> Phil. 1.23. <HI>I desire to de∣part, and to be with Christ.</HI> They go to God. As long as they are in the Bo∣dy, they are absent from the Lord, but when <HI>absent from the body they are present with the Lord,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.8. All this we see in one blessed Scripture, viz. that in Heb. 12.22, 23. <HI>We are come to the heavenly Jerusalem, to an in∣numerable company of Angels, to God the judge of all, to the Spirits of just men made perfect, to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="001767_0119_0FB826FB43CEDE68"/>PROP. III. <HI>When Godly Men dye, holy Angels carry their Souls to Heaven.</HI> They go to <HI>Abraham's Bosom,</HI> but who does Conduct them thither: <HI>Angels</HI> do it. <HI>Lazarus</HI> died, and <HI>Angels</HI> carried him to be with <HI>Abraham.</HI> As when <HI>Elijah</HI> was carried to Heaven Body and Soul, it was by the Ministry of Holy An∣gels. There was seen a <HI>Chariot of Fire, and Horses of Fire,</HI> Holy Angels appear∣ing in that Form, and <HI>Elijah went up to Heaven,</HI> 2 King. 2.11. And they shall carry the raised Bodies of the Saints to be with Christ at the Last Day, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.31. He shall send his Angels with the sound of a Trum∣pet, and they shall <HI>gather together his Elect from the four Winds, from one end of Heaven to the other.</HI> So do they do with the Souls of the Elect when their Bodies die. It was an Ancient Say∣ing among the Jewish Writers, That <HI>none have right to Paradise, but the Just, whose Souls are carried thither by Angels.</HI> The Platonick Philosophers did not only believe, that the Souls of Men
<PB N="107" REF="001767_0120_0FB826FD3304DA20"/>
were Immortal, but that the Souls of Wicked Men at the Hour of Death, were by Evil Angels carried to a worse World than this, and the Souls of Good Men by Good Angels, to a better World. We may suppose that they had this Knowlege from the Jews, and that the Jews derived it from the holy Patriarchs and Prophets. To intimate this Truth, is a special scope and design of the Parable con∣cerning <HI>Dives</HI> and <HI>Lazarus.</HI> And this has been the Faith of dying Saints. It is reported concerning the Famous <HI>Morney,</HI> that when dying he expres∣sed himself after this manner. <HI>I am ta∣king my flight to Heaven: there are An∣gels standing, ready to carry my Soul into the Bosom of my Saviour.</HI> There was a Faithful Minister of Christ in <HI>New-England,</HI> (it was Mr. <HI>Newman,</HI> Pastor of the Church in <HI>Reho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> he that wrote that excellent <HI>Concordance</HI> to the Bible, which commonly goes under the Name of the <HI>Cambridge Concor∣dance</HI>) who perceiving the approaches of Death, he was not in the least
<PB N="108" REF="001767_0121_0FB8270000818828"/>
concerned or afraid, but after he had spoke a few solemn Words to them about him, made an <HI>Apostrophe</HI> to the Angels; <HI>And now</HI> (said he) <HI>An∣gels come and do your Office.</HI> Those Words were no sooner out of his Mouth but he dyed Angels were by, they heard what he said, and were ready to Conduct his Pious Soul to Heaven. Several Things may be mentioned which confirm the Doc∣trine before us</P>
<P N="1">1. Angels are by Divine appoint∣ment, Guardians of such as belong to God. Psal 34 7. <HI>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him.</HI> They are charged with them, Psal. 91.11, 12. <HI>He shall give his Angels charge over them. They shall bear them up in their h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds.</HI> As tender Nur∣ses do the Children which are com∣mitted to their charge. An Heir of Salvation does no sooner come into the World, but Angels are charged to look after him. Nor does the great∣est Angel in Heaven think it beneath him, to have such a Charge: <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.
<PB N="109" REF="001767_0122_0FB82701280B8E70"/>
14. <HI>Are they not all ministring Spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of Salvation.</HI> For the Devil stands ready to devour them as soon as they are born, as he would have done our Saviour Christ: Rev. 12.4. <HI>The Dragon stood before the Woman, which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her Child as soon as it was born</HI>: which Words altho' figurative, have respect to that which is really true. As soon as Christ was Born, the <HI>Devil</HI> stood ready to devour Him, by his Instru∣ment <HI>Herod,</HI> but he was preserved from that Dragon, by the Ministry of an Angel, <HI>Mat.</HI> 2.13. So are the Elect of God under the Guardianship of Angels, whilest in a state of Infancy. The Scripture gives us to understand that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ones</HI> have <HI>their Angels,</HI> Mat. 18 10 And when they are arrived to Adult Age, still Angels have the charge of them. Wherever they are, whether by Sea or Land Angels are with them Thus from their Infancy, and to their Old Age, and to their dying Day. The Lord says of his
<PB N="110" REF="001767_0123_0FB827052FA0A468"/>
People, <HI>They are born by me from the belly, and are carried from the womb, and even to your old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I carry you, even I will carry and deliver you,</HI> Isai. 46.3, 4. And how does God bear and carry them? He does it by the Ministry of holy Angels. <HI>Austin</HI> in his Meditati∣ons, was affected with this thought, that <HI>from the time of his nativity to the end of his Life, Angels were appointed to be his Guardians.</HI> Can we think that Angels will take care of us all our life time, and then leave us at our Death.</P>
<P N="2">2. Angels have a great love for godly Men. They rejoyce at their welfare. They sang when there was a Saviour born for Men. Luk. 2 13, 14. <HI>There was with the Angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, glory to God in the highest, and on Earth peace, good will toward men.</HI> When an Elect sinner is Converted it causes no little joy among the Angels of God in Heaven, <HI>Luk</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 10 They praise God for his everlasting mercies to
<PB N="111" REF="001767_0124_0FB8270688743328"/>
Men that keep his Covenant. The Psalmist having spoken thus, calls up∣on Angels to bless the Lord: Psal. 103.20, 21. <HI>Bless the Lord ye his An∣gels, bless the Lord all ye his hosts, ye Mi∣nisters of his that do his pleasure.</HI> God loves godly Men, and therefore An∣gels do so, for it is natural for them to love what God loves. They love the Image of God wherever they see it. They are of the same Family with Believers on Christ, therefore they love them. Eph. 3.15. <HI>Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.</HI> Angels in Heaven and Be∣lievers on Earth belong to the same Family of God. They are fellow Ser∣vants. The Angel said to <HI>John, I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus,</HI> Rev. 19.10. Their love to holy Men must needs be confirmed and encreased, by their having been their Companions and Guardians for so long a time. Kind Offices encrease love. We see that Nurses have a special affection for the Children that have been fostered
<PB N="112" REF="001767_0125_0FB82707DCFBEFE8"/>
by them. So have the Angels of Hea∣ven for those Children of God who have been under their care, tuition, and education, and have been fostered by them from their Cradles to their Graves. Moreover, they know that godly Men shall live with them in Heaven forever, and therefore they must needs be willing to go with their Souls to Heaven when they leave this Earth.</P>
<P N="3">3. The separated Souls of godly Men, stand in need of such Guardians to carry them to Heaven. For they pass through their Enemies Country. The Air is the Devils Territory. There is a <HI>power</HI> of those evil Spirits there. The Devil is called <HI>the prince of the power of the air,</HI> Eph 2 2. If Men are to pass through the midst of Pyrates, they need a strong Convoy to guard them. The Pyrates of Hell are waiting to seize upon the Souls of Men, as soon as they are out of their Bodies. Godly Souls need not fear them, because they have a Convoy of Angels to protect them, and to car∣ry
<PB N="113" REF="001767_0126_0FB8270A9CF377F0"/>
them safe to the blessed Country whether they are bound. And as they are carried thither by Angels, so when they a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there, Angels glad∣ly receive them. They are in the Scripture represented as the Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters at the Gates of Heaven, <HI>Rev.</HI> 11.12. They will not keep those Gates shut, against any to whom Christ bids them open them.</P>
<P>PROP. IV. <HI>This Priviledge belongs to the poorest and meanest godly Men as well as to the richest and greatest.</HI> As the Psalmist speaks with respect to ano∣ther dignity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>honour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve all the Saints,</HI> Psal. 149.9. A poor beg∣garly <HI>Lazarus</HI> having a godly Soul, is conducted to Heaven after this ho∣nourable manner, with a glorious E∣quipage. The greatest King on Earth, when he removes from one place to another, has not such a splendid Equi∣page. Kings have Nobles to attend them, but poor <HI>Lazarus</HI> has Angels to accompany him, who are the Nobles of Heaven. The Soul of a poor Man,
<PB N="114" REF="001767_0127_0FB8270C61530180"/>
is as valuable as the Soul of a rich Man, more worth than the whole World. There are poor Men belonging to the Election of God, as well as rich Men. Nay, there are more poor than rich among those whom God has chosen. Jam. 2 5. <HI>Has not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to them that love him.</HI> The Redemption of the Soul of a poor Man, has cost as great a price as the Redemption of the Soul of a rich Man <HI>viz.</HI> the precious Blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God.

<P><HI>We ought to bless God for the Benefit we receive by the Ministry of Holy Angels.</HI> For the Benefit we have thereby is great. We shall not know how great until we come to be with them in the Heavenly World.

Nevertheless, their Ministry continues still, and will do so, as long as there shall be any Heirs of Salvation on the Earth. Many evils are we kept from, by their Means. If we keep in our way which God has Com∣manded us to keep in, He has charged them to keep us, and to bear us up in their hands, that we dash not our feet against a stone, <HI>Psal.</HI> 91.11, 12.

nothing for us, but by a Divine ap∣pointment, Therefore the Praise of all is due to God, and not to them. As long as we are living on the Earth, they are doing for us, and when our Bodies are dead they befriend our Souls. And ought we not to bless God for the good we receive by their Ministry, both living and dying What tho' we know not particularly when they are at work for us? We know in general, that in life and in death they are our Attendants and our Guardians; and therefore, altho' we may not give Thanks to them, they all with one Voice say, <HI>Do it not,</HI> Rev. 22.9. we may and ought to give Thanks to God for what they do, and shall do for us.</P>

<P><HI>Godly Men ought not to be afraid of Death, but rather to rejoyce at the thought of it.</HI> Death is indeed a frightful evil to Nature. The Philosopher calls it, <HI>Of all terribles the most terrible.</HI> And

<HI>Bildad</HI> styles Death, <HI>The King of Terrors,</HI> Job 18 14. It exceeds other <HI>terribles</HI> as much as a King excels ordinary Men. A great Man among the Ro∣mans was so terribly afraid of Death, as that he said he would be willing to be in any pain and misery, on condi∣tion that he might but live. And since Godly Men have Nature remain∣ing in them, the apprehension of Death is frightful to some of them. <HI>Through fear of Death they are kept in bondage all their life time.</HI> But believers ought not to be afraid of it. And we find in the Scripture that some of the Lords Servants, have been above the fear of Death. The Psalmist could say, <HI>Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.</HI> And why should he, when he had Angels to be with him? When <HI>Moses</HI> was told that he should go up Mount <HI>Nebo</HI> &amp; there die, he was no more afraid than a Man would be to go up his Chamber, there to ly down &amp; sleep. The Children of God who have Served him faithfully, should (with submission to his Will)

rather be <HI>willing,</HI> nay, <HI>desirous</HI> of the hour of their death, than to be afraid of it: 2 Cor. 5.8. <HI>We are willing <HI>rather</HI> to be absent from the body &amp; pre∣sent with the Lord.</HI> Good old <HI>Simeon</HI> said, <HI>Now Lord let thy servant depart in Peace,</HI> Luk. 2.29. And the Apostle could say, <HI>I desire to depart,</HI> Phil. 1.23. Well may they be willing &amp; desirous of the Day of Death, which will be better to them than the Day of their Birth, Considering that their Bodies are no sooner dead, but their Souls are in the hands of Angels, who will fly with them to Heaven. It is for Ungodly Men to be afraid of Death, and well they may, because of that which (as to them) shall follow Death, which what it will you may find in, Rev. 6.8. <HI>Behold a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was <HI>Death,</HI> and hell followed with him.</HI> An Ungodly Man is no sooner dead as to his Body, but his Soul is in Hell. Therefore let them fear death, and fear that God who does punish Sin with Death. Remember the awful words of Christ: Luk. 12.5.

of their Bodies, but they are sensible of this. Where was the Soul of un∣godly <HI>Dives</HI> when his Body was dead and buryed? Was his Immortal Soul carryed into Abrahams bosom? No, the next word to my Text says, <HI>In hell be lift up his eyes.</HI> And how was it with him there! was he not in flaming Tor∣ment? <HI>Lazarus</HI> his Soul was in Pa∣radise, but the Soul of <HI>Dives</HI> was in the place of Torment; and not one drop of any comfort there, how did he beg for one drop of Water to cool his Torment, but in vain. And how is it this day &amp; for ever, with the Souls of those ungodly Men that lived in the Old World, before the Flood. Are they not in Prison? Does not the Scrip∣ture say that <HI>the Spirits,</HI> the Immortal Souls of these who sometimes were disobedient in the days of Noah, <HI>are in prison,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.19, 20.

Eternal Fire</HI>? Suppose what is spoken in the Scripture concerning the Fire and Brimstone in Hell, to be Meta∣phorical, since Spirits are not capable of being hurt by a material Fire, that proves the Torment which the Damned endure, to be more terrible than the hottest Fire upon Earth. No Fire to be compared with the Fire of God's Wrath. I have somewhere Read of a miserable Man in Horror of Consci∣ence, who looking on the Fire, said, <HI>Do you see that Fire burn? To burn there, is but a Metaphor compared with what I feel in my Soul.</HI> True it is, that the Damned will be more Miserable after the Day of Judgment, than at present they are. As the Evil Angels shall; whence some of them said to Christ, <HI>Jesus thou son of God, art thou come to torment us before the time,</HI> Matt. 8.29. They know, that there will be a time, when they shall be in greater Tor∣ment than as yet they are. The same is to be said of Damned Souls. At the last Day their Bodies as well as their Souls, as they have par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to∣gether

in Sinning, will partake in E∣verlasting Punishment. Neverthe∣less their Eternal Misery begins as soon as their Souls are out of their Bodies. For then they are deprived of all those Earthly Comforts, in which they placed their Happiness. It was said to the Rich Fool in the Gospel, <HI>This night thy Soul shall be re∣quired of thee, and then whose shall these things be</HI>: Thy Goods which thou hast laid up for many Years, thou canst not carry them into the other World with thee. The Rich Man that was cloathed in Purple, and fared Sumptuously every Day, after Death, had not delicious Fare, or cost∣ly Garments to delight in. Nor will Sinners after Death has taken them out of this World, have any Friends to comfort them. If they shall meet with any of their old Friends in Hell, that will be little to their Comfort. The Rich Man had no Mind that his Brethren should come after him to Hell, <HI>Luk.</HI> 16.28. What, out of Charity to them? No, but he knew, that
