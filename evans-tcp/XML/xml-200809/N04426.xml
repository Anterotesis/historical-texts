<P>AUTHORISED by your Com∣mission, we have attempted to send the Gospel to the in∣fidel <HI>Indian</HI> Natives, that border upon the Provinces of <HI>New-York, New-Jersey,</HI> and <HI>Pennsylvania</HI>: And by Supplies received from your Honourable Society, have been en∣abled to support that charitable Undertaking.</P>
<P>THE Ordination of one of your Missionaries to this great Work, has given us an Opportunity to present the following <HI>Sermon</HI> and <HI>Narra∣tives</HI> to your candid Acceptance.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="005471_0004_101838A4AB03AC48"/>WHILE the Princes of the Earth are sending their Navies to the re∣motest Regions, to protect the Com∣merce and increase the Riches of their respective Dominions; You are engaged in the nobler Design of enlarging the Kingdom of the Great REDEEMER, and bringing the most distant Nations to a Subjection to his gracious Sceptre. Certainly no∣thing can be more worthy the chris∣tian Character, or more agreeable to generous and benevolent Minds, than to be in any Measure instru∣mental to enlighten those with the Doctrine of Salvation, who for many Ages have dwelt in the Darkness of Heathenism; and to turn them from the idolatrous Worship of the Host of Heaven, and the Spirits of their departed Heroes,—to the Service of the LIVING GOD, who made Hea∣ven and Earth.</P>

<P>MANY are the Difficulties, Self-denials, and Discouragements, which your <HI>Missionaries</HI> must pass thro', in their Endeavours to propagate the Gospel among those who renounce the Society of the civilized World, are sunk into the most degenerate State of human Nature, and have been enured from their Infancy to the most barbarous Practices.

<P>And the Lord said unto the Servant, Go out into the high-ways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GOD erected this visible world as a monument of his Glory,— a theatre for the display of his adorable perfections.—The Heavens proclaim his wisdom and power in shining characters, and the whole Earth is full of his goodness. Man was in his original creation excellently fitted for the service of GOD, and for perfect happiness in the enjoyment of the divine favour.</P>
<P>BUT Sin has disturbed the order of nature, defaced the beauty of the creation, and involved Man, the Lord of this lower world, in the most disconsolate circumstances of guilt and misery.</P>
<P>THE all-seeing eye of GOD beheld our deplorable state; infinite pity touched the heart of the Father of mercies; and infinite wisdom laid the plan of our recovery. The Majesty of heaven did not see meet to suffer the Enemy of mankind, eternally to triumph in his success; nor leave his favourite workmanship, irrecoverably to perish in the ruins of the Apostacy. By a method, which at once astonishes and delights the sublimest spirits above, he opened a way
<PB N="2" REF="005471_0008_101838B019E9A2F0"/>
for the display of his mercy, without any violation of the sacred claims of his justice; in which, the honour of the Law is vindicated, and the guilty Offender acquitted; Sin is condemned, and the Sinner eternally saved. To accom∣plish this blessed design, the beloved SON OF GOD assu∣med the nature of man,— in our nature died a spot∣less sacrifice for sin,— by the atoning virtue of his blood he <HI>made reconciliation for iniquity,</HI> — and by his perfect obedience to the law of GOD, <HI>brought in everlasting righ∣teousness.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING finished his work upon Earth, before he ascen∣ded to his heavenly Father, he commissioned the ministers of his kingdom, to <HI>preach the gospel to every creature.</HI> He sent them forth to make the most extensive offers of salva∣tion to rebellious sinners, and by all the methods of holy violence to <HI>compel them to come in,</HI> and accept the invitati∣ons of his grace. — We have a lively representation of this in the <HI>Parable,</HI> in which our text is contained.</P>
<P>THE evident design of which is, under the figure of a <HI>Marriage-Supper,</HI> to set forth the plentiful provision, which is made in our LORD JESUS CHRIST for the reception of his People, and the freedom and riches of divine grace, which invites the most unworthy and miserable Sinners, to partake of this sacred Entertainment. The first invited Guests were the <HI>Jews,</HI> the favourite people of GOD, who were heirs of divine love, while the rest of the world were <HI>Aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise</HI>: But these through the power of prevailing prejudice, and the influence of carnal affections, obstinately rejected the invitation, and were therefore fi∣nally excluded from these invaluable blessings.</P>
<P>BUT it was not the design of infinite wisdom, that these costly preparations should be lost, and the table he had spread, remain unfurnished with Guests. Therefore he sent forth his Servant <HI>into the streets and lanes of the city,</HI> and commanded him to bring in <HI>the poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind,</HI>—i, e. the most necessitous and miserable of mankind;—yea, to <HI>go out into the high-ways and hedges,</HI> to the wretched and perishing <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and not only invite,
<PB N="3" REF="005471_0009_101838B1A32BC4D8"/>
but even <HI>compel them to come in, that his house might be filled.</HI></P>
<P>The words of the Text represent to us,</P>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>melancholy state</HI> of the <HI>Gentile</HI> world. They are described as <HI>in the high-ways and hedges,</HI> in the most perishing and helpless condition.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>compassionate care,</HI> which the Blessed <HI>Redeemer</HI> takes of them in these their deplorable circumstances. He <HI>sends out his Servants</HI> to them, to invite them to partake of the entertainments of <HI>his house.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. THE duty of the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel, to <HI>compel them to come in,</HI> and accept of his gracious in∣vitation.</P>
<P>These I shall consider in their order, and then apply them to the present occasion.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST PART.</HEAD>
<P>I AM to consider the <HI>melancholy state</HI> of the <HI>Heathen</HI> world, while in the darkness of nature, and destitute of di∣vine revelation. — It is easy to harangue upon the excel∣lency and advantage of the <HI>light of nature.</HI> 'Tis agreea∣ble to the pride of mankind, to exalt the powers of hu∣man reason, and pronounce it a sufficient guide to eternal happiness. But let us enquire into the records of <HI>Anti∣quity,</HI> let us consult the experience of all ages; and we shall find that those who had no guide but the light of nature, no instructor but unassisted reason, have wandered in perpetual uncertainty, darkness, and error. Or let us take a view of the <HI>present</HI> state of those Countries that have not been illuminated by the Gospel; and we shall see, that notwithstanding the improvements of near six thousand years, they remain to this day covered with the grossest darkness, and abandoned to the most immoral and vitious practices.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="005471_0010_101838B6AFECF390"/>The beauty and good order, every where discovered in the visible frame of nature, evidences beyond all reasona∣ble dispute, the existence of an infinite and almighty Cause, who first gave being to the Universe, and still preserves it by his powerful providence. Says the Apostle to the Gen∣tiles, (Rom. 1.20.) <HI>The invisible Things of GOD, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal Power and God∣head.</HI> And yet many, even among the Philosophers of the <HI>Gentile</HI> nations, impiously denied the eternal Deity, from whose hands they received their existence; and blas∣phemed his infinite perfections, when surrounded with the clearest demonstrations of his power and goodness.—Those who acknowledged a Deity, entertained the most unwor∣thy conceptions of his nature and attributes, and worship∣ed <HI>the Creature,</HI> in the place of <HI>the Creator, who is GOD blessed for ever.</HI> — Not only the illustrious heroes of An∣tiquity, and the public Benefactors of Mankind, but even the most despicable beings in the order of nature, were enrolled in the catalogue of their gods, and became the object of their impious adoration. <HI>They changed the Glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to corrup∣tible man, to birds and four-footed beasts, and creeping things,</HI> Rom. 1.23.</P>
<P>A FEW of the sublimest genius'<HI>s</HI> of ROME and ATHENS, had some faint discoveries of the spiritual nature of the human <HI>Soul,</HI> and formed some probable conjectures, that man was designed for a future state of existence. When they considered the extensive Capacities of the humane mind, and the deep impressions of futurity, engraven in e∣very Breast; they could not but infer, that the Soul was immortal, and at death would be translated to some new and unknown state. When they saw the Virtuous oppres∣sed with various and successive Calamities; and the vilest of men triumphing in prosperity and pleasure; they enter∣tained distant hopes, that in a future revolution, these seem∣ing inequalities would be rectified, these inconsistencies re∣moved,—the Righteous distinguishingly rewarded, and the Wicked remarkably punished.—But after all their inquiries
<PB N="5" REF="005471_0011_101838B95A1FA710"/>
upon this important subject, they attained no higher, than some probable conjectures, some uncertain expectations. — And when they came to describe the nature and situation of these invisible regions of happiness or misery, they made the wildest guesses, and run into the most absurd and vain imaginations. The <HI>Heaven</HI> they contrived for the enter∣tainment of the virtuous, was made up of sensual pleasures, beneath the dignity of human nature, and inconsistent with perfect felicity: The <HI>Hell</HI> they described for the pun∣ishment of the vitious, consisted in ridiculous terrors, unworthy the belief of a rational and religious Crea∣ture.</P>
<P>THEIR <HI>practices</HI> were equally corrupt with their princi∣ples. As the most extravagant errors were received among the established articles of their faith, so the most in∣famous vices obtained in their practice, and were indulged not only with impunity, but authorised by the sanction of their laws. They stupidly erected altars to idols of wood and stone; paid divine honours to those, who in their lives had been the greatest monsters of lust and cruelty; yea, offered up their Sons and Daughters as sacrifices to Devils. The principles of honour, the restraints of shame, the pre∣cepts of their Philosophers were all too weak, to keep their corruptions within any tolerable bounds. The wickedness of their hearts broke through every inclosure, and deluged the Earth with rapine and violence, blood and slaughter, and all manner of brutish and detestable impurities.—It is hardly possible to read the melancholy description of the principles and manners of the heathen world, given us by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> without horror and surprise. To think, that man once the <HI>friend of GOD,</HI> and <HI>the Lord of this lower world,</HI> should thus <HI>deny the GOD that made him,</HI> and bow down to <HI>dumb idols</HI>; should thus by lust and intemperance, degrade himself into the character of the <HI>Beast, which hath no un∣derstanding</HI>; and by pride, malice, and revenge, transform himself into the very image of the <HI>Devil, who was a mur∣derer from the beginning.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was the state of the <HI>gentile</HI> nations, when the light of the Gospel appeared, to scatter the darkness that over∣spread
<PB N="6" REF="005471_0012_101838BDD56A4108"/>
the face of the Earth. And this has been the case, so far as has yet appeared, of all the nations ever since, upon whom the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS <HI>has not arose with healing in his wings.</HI> Every new-discovered Country opens a new scene of astonishing ignorance and barbarity; and gives us fresh evidence of the universal corruption of human nature.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SECOND PART.</HEAD>
<P>I PROCEED now to consider the <HI>compassionate Care</HI> and <HI>Kindness</HI> of our Blessed REDEEMER towards mankind, in these their deplorable circumstances. He <HI>sends out his Servants,</HI> to invite them <HI>to come in,</HI> and accept the enter∣tainments of <HI>his house.</HI></P>
<P>GOD might have left his guilty creatures, to have eter∣nally suffered the dismal effects of their apostacy, without the least imputation of injustice, or violence of his infinite perfections. The fall was the consequence of man's cri∣minal choice, and attended with the highest aggravations. —The <HI>Angels that sinned,</HI> were made examples of GOD's righteous severity, and are reserved <HI>in chains</HI> of guilt <HI>to the Judgment of the great day.</HI> Mercy, that tender, attribute of the divine nature, did not interpose in their behalf, to suspend the execution of their sentence, or avert GOD's threatned displeasure: their punishment is, unalterably decreed, their Judgment is irreversible; they are the awful monuments of revenging wrath, and are con∣demned <HI>to blackness of darkness for ever.</HI>— Now Justice might have shewn the same inflexible severity to rebellious man, and have left the universal progeny of <HI>Adam,</HI> to perish in their guilt and misery. It was unmerited mercy, that distinguished the human race, in providing a Saviour for us; and the most signal compassion that revealed the counsels of heaven for our recovery.</P>
<P>BUT though Justice did not oblige the divine Being to provide for our relief, yet the Goodness of the indulgent Father of the universe inclined him to shew pity to his guilty Creatures, who fell from their innocence, through the subtilty and malice of seducing and apostate Spirits.
<PB N="7" REF="005471_0013_101838BFCF1294E0"/>
It was agreeable to the divine wisdom, to disappoint the devices of Satan, the enemy of GOD and Goodness, and recover the creatures he had made, from their subjection to the powers of darkness.</P>
<P>HE therefore gave early discoveries of his designs of mer∣cy to our first Parents, and immediately upon the apostacy opened a door of hope for their recovery. He revealed a SAVIOUR to the antient Patriarchs, under dark types, and by distant promises; made clearer declarations of his will, as the appointed time drew near, for the accom∣plishment of the promises, and the manifestation of the Son of GOD in human flesh.— <HI>And when the fulness of time was come, GOD sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</HI></P>
<P>THIS divine and illustrious Person left the bosom of his Father, that he might put on the Character of a servant; — descended from the glories of heaven, that he might dwell on this inferior earth;— was made under the law, that he might fulfill all righteousness;— submitted to the infirmities of human nature, to the sorrows and sufferings of an afflicted life, and to the agonies of a painful igno∣minious death on a cross, that he might destroy the power of sin, abolish the empire of death, and purchase immortality and glory for perishing Man.</P>
<P>WHILE our LORD JESUS resided in this lower world, he preached the glad tidings of salvation, and published the kingdom of GOD; confirming his doctrine by nume∣rous and undoubted miracles, and recommending his instruc∣tions by the charms of a spotless life and conversation. He sent forth his Apostles to pursue the same gracious design of gospellising the people, and furnished them with sufficient powers to proselyte the nations to the faith. He also appointed a standing ministry, to carry on a treaty of peace with rebellious <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ners, in the successive ages of the Church; to continue, till the number of the re∣deeem'd is completed, and the whole <HI>election of grace</HI> placed in circumstances of spotless purity and perfect hap∣piness.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005471_0014_101838C4CE9A3090"/>THESE ministers are styled <HI>the Servants of CHRIST,</HI> by way of eminence: They are in a peculiar manner devoted to the Service of their divine master; from him they re∣ceive their commission; by him they are appointed to represent his person, preside in his worship, and teach the laws of his Kingdom.— To assume this character without being divinely called, and regularly introduced into this sacred office, is a bold invasion of CHRIST's royal autho∣rity, and an open violation of that order, which he has e∣stablished in his Church.— These not only derive their mission from CHRIST, but it is <HI>his doctrine</HI> they are to preach, and not the inventions of their own brain:—it is <HI>his glory</HI> they are to promote, and not their own interest or honor:—their business is not to propagate the designs of a party, but <HI>the common salvation,</HI> and to <HI>beseech</HI> all, <HI>in CHRIST's name, to be reconciled unto GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THE Apostles, the primitive heralds of the everlasting Gospel, were sent to make the first Tender of salvation to <HI>the lost sheep of the house of</HI> ISRAEL; they were comman∣ded to begin at JERUSALEM, the centre of the Jewish Commonwealth: But when the Jews obstinately persisted in their impenitence and unbelief, they were commissi∣oned <HI>to preach the gospel to every Creature under hea∣ven:</HI>— The sinners of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> were invited to <HI>come in,</HI> and accept of the offers of salvation.</P>
<P>THE Prophets pointed out a <HI>Messiah</HI> that was to come, and proclaimed the joyful approach of a Redeemer, at the time appointed in the sovereign counsels of heaven. The ministers of the Gospel now are sent to declare, that the prophecies are accomplished, the promise fulfilled, justice satisfied, salvation purchased; and all that will <HI>come in,</HI> shall receive the blessings of the gospel. They are not only freely to invite Sinners, of all orders and degrees, of all ages and nations; but to assure them, that <HI>all things are now ready,</HI> and to use the most powerful and persuasive methods, that they may engage them to comply with the heavenly Call.— Which brings me to the third thing proposed.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="005471_0015_101838C7FA3A8650"/>
<HEAD>THIRD PART.</HEAD>
<P>I AM next to shew, that it is the great duty of the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the gospel <HI>to compel sinners to come in,</HI> and accept of the blessings of the Gospel.— This is so plain∣ly contained in my text, that I shall not multiply argu∣ments to confirm it. My only business shall be to ex∣plain the nature of this compulsion, or shew in what manner sinners are to be <HI>compelled to come in</HI> to the Chri∣stian Church.— And sure I am, I must answer, negatively, not by the deceitful methods of fraud and disguise, — nor the inhuman practices of persecution and violence. This text indeed has often been alledged by the <HI>persecu∣ting bigots</HI> of all ages, and apply'd to support the cause of <HI>religious tyranny</HI>; to the infinite scandal of the chris∣tian name, and the unspeakable detriment of the christi∣an interest. — By this means the Enemies of our most holy faith have been strengthen'd in their infidelity, the weak have been turned aside from <HI>the truth, as it is in JESUS,</HI> and the peaceable kingdom of the Messiah trans∣formed into a field of blood,—a scene of hellish and hor∣rid cruelties. If this were the <HI>compulsion</HI> recommended in the gospel, then absolute unrelenting tyrants would be the proper and most infallible teachers; then racks and tor∣tures would be the genuine and most successful method of propagating the faith. But surely every thing of this kind, every violent and driving measure, is in direct op∣position to the precepts and example of our blessed Savi∣our, and contrary to the very genius of his gospel, — which proclaims, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luk.</HI> 2.14.</NOTE> <HI>Glory to GOD in the highest, on earth peace, good-will towards men</HI></P>
<P>THE Princes of this world exercise a temporal domi∣nion over mankind, and by fines levied on their estates and punishments inflicted upon their bodies, force men to an outward subjection to their authority and govern∣ment.— But the kingdom of our Lord is of a spiritual
<PB N="10" REF="005471_0016_101838C9864FF398"/>
nature: He erects his empire in the hearts of men, and reigns ever <HI>a willing people in the day of his power.</HI> Ex∣ternal violence may necessitate men to an external profes∣sion of the truth, and procure a dissembled compliance with the institutions of CHRIST; but can never enligh∣ten the darkness of the mind, conquer the rebellion of the will, nor sanctify and save the soul. It may transfigure men into accomplish'd hypocrites; but will never convert them into real saints.</P>
<P>THE Gospel was originally propagated by the power∣ful preaching of CHRIST and his Apostles, by the aston∣ishing miracles which they wrought in confirmation of their doctrine, and the exemplary lives by which they a∣dorned their profession and character. Instead of propa∣gating their religion by the destructive methods of fire and sword, they submitted to the rage and cruelty of a ma∣lignant world with surprising patience, and sacrificed their very lives in the cause of GOD, without any intemperate discoveries of anger and resentment:— instead of calling for <HI>fire from heaven</HI> to destroy their opposers, they com∣passionated their ignorance, instructed them with <HI>meekness,</HI> counsel'd and exhorted them with <HI>all long-suffering and doctrine,</HI> and even spent their dying breath in praying for their conviction and conversion, that they might be saved in the day of the LORD JESUS.</P>
<P>Now in imitation of these primitive Doctors of the christian church, these wise and successful preachers of the Gospel, it is the duty of the ministers of the <HI>present</HI> day, to use the same methods of compassion and friendly vio∣lence. A disinterested zeal for the glory of God, a sted∣fast adherence to the truth, and unshaken fidelity in our Master's cause, with universal benevolence to mankind, must constantly animate our public discourses, and be con∣spicuous in our private conversation and behaviour. — We must diligently indeavour to convince the understan∣dings, engage the affections, and direct the practice of our hearers.—Upon this head, it may not be amiss to descend to a few particulars.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="005471_0017_101838CC7293F7B0"/>1. MINISTERS are to <HI>compel</HI> sinners <HI>to come in,</HI> by set∣ting before them their <HI>guilty</HI> and <HI>perishing condition by na∣ture.</HI>— Sinners are naturally fond of carnal ease and se∣curity; they are delighted with their pleasant and profi∣table sins; they even <HI>drink in iniquity like water,</HI> with great greediness, with insatiable thirst, and incessant gra∣tification, but without fear or remorse. Upon this ac∣count, there is the highest necessity, to sound an alarm in their ears, that they may be awaken'd, to see and consi∣der their dangerous state; or else they will never be ex∣cited to <HI>flee from the wrath to come.</HI> The secure Sinner is insensible of this want of a Saviour:— <HI>the whole need not a Physician, but they that are sick.</HI></P>
<P>To this end, the ministers of the gospel are to set <HI>the terrors of the LORD</HI> in array against the sinner, and let him hear the <HI>thunder of divine curses,</HI> that utter their voice against the unbelieving. They are to represent in the clearest light, and with the most convincing evidence, the evil of sin, and the danger it exposes to; that <HI>wrath from heaven is revealed against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> 1.18.</NOTE>; that the flaming sword of incensed justice is unsheathed, and the arm of the Almighty ready to de∣stroy such as are <HI>going on still in their trespasses,</HI> impenitent and secure.— They are not only thus to shew 'em their danger; but to set before them at the same time their wretched and helpless circumstances:—that there's no hu∣man eye can successfully pity them, nor any created arm can bring them effectual deliverance;— that, while in a state of unregenerate nature, they are destitute of strength to perform any acceptable service to the blessed GOD, and unable to make any adequate satisfaction to his offen∣ded Justice; — that indeed they can neither a∣void the divine displeasure, nor endure the punishment that is due to their crimes.— Thus by a faithful appli∣cation of the law and its threatnings, we should endea∣vour, by GOD's blessing, to make way for the reception
<PB N="12" REF="005471_0018_101838CFE3C20998"/>
of the gospel and its promises.— This was the wise me∣thod observed by our blessed Saviour, the first preacher of the gospel; and by the Apostles, his inspired successors. So <HI>John</HI> the baptist, who served as <HI>the morning star,</HI> to usher in the appearance of the <HI>Sun of righteousness,</HI> did thus <HI>prepare the way of the LORD,</HI> by enlightning the minds of men, in the knowledge of their guilt and mise∣ry, and inciting them to flee from the <HI>damnation of hell.</HI> — The three thousand that were converted to the faith at one sermon, in the infancy of the christian church, were first awakened with a sense of their aggravated guilt, in <HI>crucifying the LORD of Glory,</HI> and brought in agony and distress to cry out, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> 2.36, 37.</NOTE> <HI>Men and brethren, what shall we do?</HI></P>
<P>THIS method, I confess, is disagreeable to the senti∣ments and inclinations of a secure world; and may expose us to the reproach of those <HI>that are at ease in Zion:</HI> but is agreeable the dictates of an enlightned mind, confor∣mable to the plan laid down in the sacred Scriptures, and has in all ages approved itself the most success∣ful method of promoting the interests of real and vital religion.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY are to <HI>compel</HI> sinners <HI>to come in,</HI> by a lively re∣presentation of the <HI>power</HI> and <HI>grace</HI> of our almighty <HI>Re∣deemer.</HI>—Not all the thunder and terror of curses from mount <HI>Ebal,</HI> not all the tremendous <HI>wrath revealed from heaven against the ungodly,</HI> not all the anguish and horror of a <HI>wounded spirit</HI> in an awaken'd sinner, are able to pro∣duce an unfeigned and effectual compliance with the gos∣pel-terms of mercy. The ministry of the <HI>Law</HI> can only give the <HI>knowledge of sin,</HI> rouse the sinner's conscience, and alarm his fears: it is the dispensation of <HI>Grace,</HI> that sanc∣tifies and saves the soul. Nor is the former needful but in order to the latter. So much conviction, as gives us a sight of our sin and misery, as inclines us to <HI>flee from the
<PB N="13" REF="005471_0019_101838D4CD88B0F0"/>
wrath to come,</HI> and disposes us to submit to the gospel-method of salvation <HI>by grace through faith,</HI> by sovereign mercy through the mediator, so much is necessary; and more is neither requisite, nor useful, or desira∣ble.</P>
<P>IT is not the office of preachers to be perpetually em∣ployed in the language of terror, or exhaust their strength and zeal in awakening and distressing subjects. No, but as it is their distinguishing character, that they are <HI>mini∣sters of the gospel,</HI> so it is their peculiar business to <HI>preach the unsearchable riches of CHRIST.</HI> The Person and offi∣ces and love of the great Redeemer, the merits of his o∣bedience and purchases of his cross, the victories of his resurrection, the triumphs of his ascension, and prevalence of his intercession, the power of his Spirit, greatness of his salvation, freeness of his grace, &amp;c. These are to be the chosen and delightful subjects of their discourses. — They are to represent him as one —Who has completely answered the demands of the law, rendered the Deity pro∣pitious to the sinner, and upon this account is able eternally to save us from the vengeance of an offended GOD; — Who is cloathed with almighty power, to subdue the in∣veterate habits of sin, sanctify our polluted nature, and re∣store us to spiritual health and purity;— Who is LORD OF THE VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE WORLDS, who knows how to defeat the most artful devices of Satan, and will finally render his people victorious over their most malici∣ous and implacable adversaries;— Who having <HI>made re∣conciliation for iniquity</HI> upon the cross, is pleading the merits of his blood in heaven, and powerfully interceed∣ing for all suitable blessings in behalf of his people; — <HI>Who is</HI> there <HI>exalted as a prince and a Saviour to give re∣pentance and remission of sins</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts <HI>5.31.</HI></NOTE>, and is <HI>able to save unto the uttermost all those that come to GOD in and thro him</HI>; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> 7.25.</NOTE>— in fine, Who from his illustrious throne in glory stoops to
<PB N="14" REF="005471_0020_101838D9F3E6C228"/>
look down with pity upon guilty and perishing sinners, stretches forth the sceptre of grace, and opens the ever∣lasting arms of his mercy to receive them.— These pecu∣liar doctrines of the gospel they are frequently to teach, upon these they are to dwell with constant pleasure, that sinners may be perswaded to hearken to the inviting voice of divine love, and put their trust in this almighty and compassionate Saviour. — In order to which,</P>
<P N="3">3. THEY are to shew sinners the mighty <HI>encouragement,</HI> that the gospel gives them to <HI>accept</HI> of CHRIST, and <HI>Salvation</HI> through his merits and righteousness.— As for ignorant <HI>presumers,</HI> these hear the glad tidings of the gospel with a fatal indifference; and say in their hearts, <HI>they shall have peace,</HI> though they go on in their evil way, stupidly <HI>neglecting so great salvation,</HI> and regardless of e∣ternal things. But <HI>awaken'd</HI> minds are rather apt to draw the darkest conclusions with respect to their case, and to judge themselves excluded from the invitations of the gospel.—Sometimes they imagine, that the <HI>number</HI> and <HI>aggravations</HI> of their <HI>sins</HI> exceed the designs of pardoning mercy:— At other times, that they have so long resisted the heavenly call, that now the gate of heaven is irreco∣verably barred against them:— And Satan further sug∣gests, that it would be the height of <HI>presumption</HI> in them to lay claim to the blessings of the gospel, till <HI>better pre∣pared</HI> for the divine reception. — Upon such imaginary and false grounds as these, multitudes of the invited guests make <HI>excuses,</HI> and exclude themselves from the <HI>marriage-supper of the Lamb.</HI> It is therefore the business of the servants of CHRIST to shew, that <HI>there is yet room,</HI> even for the greatest and vilest sinners to <HI>come in,</HI> and partake of the gospel-festival; that <HI>all things are now ready,</HI> for their welcome entertainment;— that the <HI>door</HI> is still <HI>open,</HI> and there's free access, not only for those who have esca∣ped the grosser pollutions of the world, but even <HI>for the chief of sinners,</HI> whose guilt is of a <HI>crimson</HI> colour and a <HI>scar∣let</HI> dye; that neither the number nor aggravations of their iniquities will exclude them a share in the divine mercy,
<PB N="15" REF="005471_0021_101838DBE8CAB020"/>
if now they submit to the sceptre of grace; — that what∣ever their condition and circumstances may be, it is of present obligation upon them to accept the gospel-call, and their instant duty to <HI>come in</HI>; the <HI>Master</HI> invites them <HI>to come to him, that they may have life</HI>: and <HI>whosoever do so,</HI> the Master of the house has assured them, that <HI>he will in no wise cast them out.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Joh. 6.37.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. THEY are to exhibit the unspeakable <HI>advantages,</HI> that will attend a compliance with the gospel-call. — I know indeed, the religion of JESUS is by its enemies of∣ten represented in the most frightful and hideous colours, — particularly as laying an unreasonable restraint on the liberties of mankind, and sinking them into melancholy enthusiasts. It becomes us therefore, who are <HI>set for the defence of the Gospel,</HI> to endeavour the removing this groundless prejudice, and to convince mankind by the light of reason and scripture, that <HI>the ways of wisdom are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace</HI>: that verily a life of <HI>faith</HI> in the blessed Redeemer is the way to be happy, both here and hereafter.</P>
<P>O WHAT more honourable, than to be <HI>a child of GOD, an heir of the kingdom of heaven?</HI> What more pleasing, than to look back, and behold our past iniquities all buried in the depths of eternal oblivion;— than to look forward, and view our dear Saviour acknowledging us his friends and favourites, and adjudging us to a state of un∣perishing glory? What more advantageous, than to have the divine favour engaged for our protection, the promises of divine grace for our consolation, and an assur∣ed title to <HI>an inheritance undefiled, incorruptible, and eter∣nal?</HI> This is the portion of the true Believer. These the privileges, that attend a compliance with the gos∣pel-call.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="005471_0022_101838DF462716A8"/>THESE things are to be represented in such a manner as may tend to captivate the hearts of men, and engage them in a solicitous care and resolution to renounce the de∣grading servitude of sin, and resign themselves to the power of redeeming grace. Thus by the most effectual and perswasive methods, the ministers of <HI>JESUS</HI> are to <HI>compel</HI> sinners <HI>to come in, that his house may be fill∣ed.</HI></P>
<P>IT was not in my design, to consider the duty of the ministry in its just extent; but only to insist upon those things that more properly belong to my subject and lie directly in the view of my text.</P>
<P>IT will now doubtless be expected, that I APPLY my discourse, more immediately to the <HI>present occa∣sion.</HI></P>
<P>AND suffer me, DEAR SIR, in the first place to address myself to you, who are this day coming under a publick consecration to the service of CHRIST, <HI>to bear his name a∣mong the</HI> Gentiles; <HI>to whom the Master is now sending you forth, to compel them to come in, that his house may be fill∣ed.</HI> We trust, you are <HI>a chosen vessel,</HI> designed for exten∣sive service in this honourable, though difficult employ∣ment. We adore the GOD of nature, who has furnish∣ed you with such endowments as suit you to this impor∣tant charge. We adore the great Head of the church for the nobler gifts and graces of his SPIRIT; by which, we trust, you are enabled to engage in this mission with an ardent love to GOD, the universal Father of mankind, wiih a disinterested zeal for the honour of CHRIST, the compassionate friend of sinners, and with tender concern for the perishing Souls of a <HI>People that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death</HI>; who have for so many ages been wandring out of the way of sal∣vation, <HI>without CHRIST, and without GOD in the world.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="005471_0023_101838E1EB076568"/>THE work of the ministry, in every place, has its difficulties and dangers, and requires much wisdom, for∣titude, patience, and self-denial, to discharge it in a right manner, with an encouraging prospect of success: But greater degrees of prudence, humility and meekness, mor∣tification to the present world, holy courage, and zeal for the honour of GOD our SAVIOUR, are necessary where any are call'd to minister the Gospel unto those, who through a long succession of ages have dwelt in the dark∣ness of heathenism, have from their infancy imbibed inve∣terate prejudices against the christian faith, and from time immemorial been inured to many superstitious and idola∣trous practices, directly opposite to the nature and design of the gospel.</P>
<P>WHAT heavenly <HI>skill</HI> is required, to convey the super∣natural mysteries of the gospel into the Minds of uninstru∣cted Pagans, who are <HI>a people of a strange speech and hard language?</HI>— What deep <HI>self-denial</HI> is necessary, to enable you chearfully to forsake the pleasures of your native Country, with the agreeable society of your friends and acquaintance, to dwell among those who inhabit not in∣deed <HI>the high-ways and hedges,</HI> but uncultivated desarts, and the remotest recesses of the wilderness?— What un∣wearied <HI>zeal</HI> and <HI>diligence,</HI> to proselyte those to the faith of the gospel, who have quenched the light of reason, and by their inhumane and barbarous practices have placed themselves upon a level with the brute-crea∣tion?</P>
<P>METHINKS, I hear you crying out, <HI>Who is sufficient for these things!</HI>— And indeed, if you had no strength to depend upon, but only your own, — no encourage∣ment, but from human assistance, you might justly sink down in a disconsolate despair, and utter the passionate language of MOSES, <HI>O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send</HI>: Thy servant is in∣sufficient for so great a work.—But it is at the command of CHRIST, the great Head of the church, that you go forth; who by a train of surprising providences, has been preparing your way for this important embassy; and
<PB N="18" REF="005471_0024_101838E7117F5EC0"/>
therefore you may be assured, that he will support you in the faithful discharge of your duty, accept your unfeigned desires to promote the interests of his kingdom, and final∣ly reward your imperfect services with his gracious appro∣bation. You have his divine promise for your security and consolation; <HI>Lo! I am with you alway, even to the end of the world.</HI> This will afford you light in every dark∣ness,—defence in every danger, —strength in every weak∣ness,—a final victory over every temptation. If CHRIST be with you, <HI>in vain do the heathen rage,</HI> in vain will their confederated tribes unite their forces to obstruct and dis∣courage you. Infinite wisdom will be your guide,— Al∣mighty power your shield,— and GOD himself <HI>your ex∣ceeding great reward.</HI> The presence of your divine Mas∣ter will make amends for the absence of your dearest friends and relatives. This will transform a wild and un∣cultivated desart into a paradise of joy and pleasure; and the lonely hutts of savages into more delightful habita∣tions than the palaces of Princes.</P>
<P>LET not then any difficulties discourage, any dangers affright you. Go forth <HI>in the name</HI> and <HI>strength</HI> of the Lord JESUS, to whom you are now to be devoted in the sacred office of the ministry. <HI>Be not ashamed of the gospel of CHRIST; for it is the power of GOD unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile.</HI> Let zeal for the honour of GOD, and com∣passion for the souls of men, animate your publick dis∣courses and private addresses to the people committed to your charge. Always remember, that your character is A MINISTER OF JESUS; and therefore with the inspir∣ed Doctor of the Gentiles, you <HI>are to know nothing a∣mong them, save CHRIST and him crucified.</HI> Frequently consider, that the gospel is a divine discipline to purify the heart, and set up the kingdom of the Redeemer in the souls of men: And therefore it is not sufficient to bring sinners to a profession of the name of CHRIST, and an outward subjection to the institutions of divine worship. <HI>You are sent to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God — that they may receive for∣giveness
<PB N="19" REF="005471_0025_101838E8ABEF0A30"/>
of sins, and an inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith that is in CHRIST.</HI> Unless this be ef∣fected (whatever other improvements they gain) they are left under the dominion of sin, and exposed to the wrath of GOD; and their superior degrees of knowledge will only serve to light them down to the regions of death and misery.— <HI>This</HI> then is to be the principal design of your ministry: For <HI>this</HI> you are to labour with un∣wearied application,— and with incessant importunity to encompass the throne of that God, whose peculiar prero∣gative it is <HI>to teach us to profit</HI>; whose grace alone can make them <HI>a willing people in the day of his power</HI></P>
<P>AND for your encouragement, I will only add,—When I consider the many prophecies, in sacred scripture, of the triumphant progress of the gospel in the last ages of the world, I cannot but <HI>lift up</HI> my <HI>head with joy</HI> in an humble expectation, that the <HI>day draws near,</HI> yea, is <HI>even at hand,</HI> when the promises made to the Son of God shall be more illustriously fulfilled: — <HI>When he shall have the heathen for his inheritance, amd the utmost ends of the earth for his possession; — When his name shall be great among the gen∣tiles, and be</HI> honoured and adored <HI>from the rising of the sun to the going down of the same.</HI>— But if the appoint∣ed time is not yet come, and the attempts made to intro∣duce this glorious day, fail of desired success,—<HI>your judg∣ment will be with the Lord, and your Reward with your God.</HI> If the gentiles <HI>be not gathered</HI> in; you will <HI>be glo∣rious in the eyes of the Lord,</HI> who accepts and rewards his servants according to the sincerity of their desires, and not according to the success of their endeavours.</P>
<P>I shall CONCLUDE, with a few words to the <HI>Body of the People.</HI></P>
<P>GOD our Saviour, in infinite condescension, hath <HI>sent his servants</HI> to invite you to <HI>come in,</HI> and receive the bles∣sings, which infinite wisdom has contrived, and astonishing grace prepared, for your entertainment. And surely MY BRETHREN, it is your important duty, and incomparable
<PB N="20" REF="005471_0026_101838EDABF53450"/>
interest, not to despise <HI>the salvation of God sent unto the gentiles,</HI> nor <HI>make light of</HI> the gospel-message to you.</P>
<P>GÒD has been pleased to employ us the messengers of his grace, <HI>Men of like passions</HI> with yourselves, subject to the common infirmities of human nature: But the mes∣sage comes from Him, who is KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS; whom you are under the strongest obligations to hear and obey, in point of interest, gratitude, and duty.</P>
<P>WHAT gracious and condescending methods has he taken, to allure and invite you! Has he not descended from heaven to earth; from the boundless glories of eter∣nity, to all the sufferings and afflictions of this mortal life, that he might purchase and reveal salvation; that he might engage your love, and perswade you to comply with his saving designs! Does he not send his <HI>Embassa∣dors to beseech you in his stead, to be reconciled to God!</HI></P>
<P>WHAT excuses have you to make, that will stand the trial of an enlightned conscience, or justify you at the awful tribunal of God? Will the vanishing enjoyments of sin and sense, or the perishing riches of this transitory world, make amends for the loss of the divine favour, or support you under the terrors of eternal damnation?</P>
<P>ARE there any honours comparable to the dignity and character of a child of God, — a title to the privileges of his house and family? Are there any pleasures equal to the smiles of God's reconciled face,— the refreshing visits of his love,— the immortal <HI>joys of his salva∣tion!</HI></P>
<P>BUT how deplorable, how desperate will be your case, if you finally refuse the gospel-invitation, and perish in your natural state of guilt and misery? The compassionate JESUS, who now addresses you in the inviting language of love, will then speak to you with the voice of terror, and <HI>swear in his wrath, that you shall never enter into his rest,</HI> that <HI>you shall never taste of his supper,</HI> the rich provision which he has made for the eternal entertainment of his guests. <HI>When once the Master of the house is risen up
<PB N="21" REF="005471_0027_101838F19BC321C8"/>
and hath shut to the door,</HI> you will in vain <HI>stand without,</HI> and <HI>knock</HI> for admission.</P>
<P>IN a word, <HI>Now,</HI> he declares by his servants, that <HI>all things are ready,</HI> — and all that are <HI>bidden,</HI> shall be welcome, upon their <HI>coming in,</HI> to be <HI>partakers of the be∣nefit.</HI> The blood of Christ is now ready, to cleanse you from all your guilt and pollution; — His righte∣ousness is now ready, to adorn your naked souls with the garment of salvation; — His Spirit is now ready, to take possession of you, and make you eternal monuments of victorious and redeeming grace. <HI>The Spirit and the Pride say, Come; and whosoever</HI> (of the lost and perish∣ing sons of <HI>Adam) will, let him come,</HI> and participate of the blessings of the gospel <HI>freely, without money and without price.</HI> The arms of everlasting mercy are open, to re∣ceive you: The treasures of divine grace are open, to supply your wants: And every one of you that now sin∣cerely accepts this gracious invitation, shall hereafter be admitted <HI>to sit down with</HI> Abraham, Isaac, <HI>and</HI> Jacob <HI>in the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>For which, God of his infinite mercy prepare us all, thro' Jesus Christ: to whom be glory and dominion world without end.</P>

<HEAD>An APPENDIX, Containing a short Account of the Endeavours, that have been used by the Missionaries of the SOCIE∣TY <HI>in</HI> Scotland <HI>for propagating Christian Knowledge,</HI> to introduce the Gospel among the <HI>Indians</HI> up∣on the Borders of <HI>New-York,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE deplorable, perishing State of the <HI>Indians</HI> in these Parts of <HI>America,</HI> being by several Ministers here represented to the <HI>Society in</HI> Scotland <HI>for propagating Christian Knowledge</HI>; the said Society cha∣ritably and chearfully came into the Proposal of main∣taining <HI>two Missionaries</HI> among these miserable Pagans, to endeavour their Conversion <HI>from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD</HI>: and sent their Commission to some Ministers and other Gentlemen here, to act as their <HI>Correspondents,</HI> in providing, di∣recting, and inspecting the said Mission.</P>
<P>As soon as the Correspondents were authorized by the Society's Commission, they immediately looked out for two Candidates of the evangelical Ministry, whose Zeal for the Interests of the REDEEMER's Kingdom, and whose Compassion for poor perishing Souls, would prompt them to such an exceeding difficult and self-denying Un∣dertaking. — They first prevail'd with Mr. <HI>Azariah Hor∣ton</HI> to relinquish a Call to an encouraging Parish, and to
<PB N="23" REF="005471_0029_101838F66021F7A8"/>
devote himself to the <HI>Indian</HI> Service. — He was directed to <HI>Long-Island,</HI> in <HI>August</HI> 1741, at the East End whereof there are two small Towns of the <HI>Indians</HI>; and from the East to the West End of the Island, lesser Companies settled at a few Miles Distance from one another, for the Length of above an Hundred Miles.— At his first com∣ing among these, he was well received by the most, and heartily welcom'd by some of them.— They at the East End of the Island especially, gave diligent and serious At∣tention to his Instructions, and were many of them put upon solemn Enquiries about <HI>what they should do to be saved.</HI>— A general Reformation of Manners was soon observable among the most of these <HI>Indians.</HI>—They were careful to attend, and serious and solemn in Attendance, upon both publick and private Instructions. — A Number of them were under very deep Convictions of their misera∣ble perishing State; and about <HI>twenty</HI> of them give last∣ing Evidences of their saving Conversion to God.— Mr. <HI>Horton</HI> has baptized <HI>thirty five</HI> Adults, and <HI>forty four</HI> Children. — He took Pains with them to learn them to read; and some of them have made considerable Profici∣ency. But the Extensiveness of his Charge, and the Ne∣cessity of his travelling from Place to Place, makes him incapable of giving so constant Attendance to their In∣struction in Reading, as is needful. In his last Letter to the Correspondents, he heavily complains of a great <HI>De∣fection</HI> of some of them, from their first Reformation and Care of their Souls, occasioned by strong Drink being brought among them, and their being thereby allured to a Relapse into their darling Vice of Drunkenness: A Vice, to which the <HI>Indians</HI> are every where so greatly ad∣dicted, and so vehemently disposed, that Nothing but the Power of divine Grace can restrain that impetuous Lust, when they have Opportunity to gratify it. He likewise complains, that some of them are grown more careless and remiss in the Duties of religious Worship, than they were when first acquainted with the great Things of their eter∣nal Peace.— But as a Number retain their first Impressi∣ons,
<PB N="24" REF="005471_0030_101838FBD07F9E18"/>
and as they generally attend with Reverence upon his Ministry, he goes on in his Work, with encouraging Hopes of the Presence and Blessing of God with him in his difficult Undertaking.</P>
<P>This is a general View of the State of the Mission up∣on <HI>Long-Island,</HI> collected from several of Mr. <HI>Horton</HI>'s Letters; which is all that could now be offered, not ha∣ving as yet a particular Account from Mr. <HI>Horton</HI> him∣self.</P>
<P>It was some Time after Mr. <HI>Horton</HI> was imploy'd in the <HI>Indian</HI> Service, before the Correspondents could obtain another qualified Candidate for this self-denying Mission. At length they prevailed with Mr. <HI>David Brainerd,</HI> to refuse several Invitations unto Places where he had a pro∣mising Prospect of a comfortable Settlement among the <HI>English,</HI> to encounter the Fatigues and Perils, that must attend his carrying the Gospel of Christ to these poor mi∣serable Savages. — A general Representation of whose Conduct and Success in that Undertaking, is contain'd in a <HI>Letter</HI> we lately received from himself, which is as fol∣lows.—</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Rev. Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE you are pleased to require of me some brief and general Account of my Conduct in the Affair of my Mission amongst the <HI>Indians</HI>; the Pains and En∣deavours I have used to propagate <HI>Christian Knowledge</HI> a∣mong them; the Difficulties I have met with in Pursu∣ance of that great Work; and the hopeful and encoura∣ging Appearances I have observed in any of them: I shall now endeavour to answer your Demands, by giving a brief
<PB N="25" REF="005471_0031_101838FF0139DF90"/>
but faithful Account of the most material Things relating to that important Affair, with which I have been, and am still concerned. And this I shall do with more Freedom, and Chearfulness, both because I apprehend it will be a likely Means to give pious Persons, who are concern'd for the Kingdom of CHRIST, some just Apprehension of the many and great Difficulties, that attend the Propaga∣tion of it amongst the poor Pagans, and consequently 'tis hopeful, will engage their more frequent and fervent Pray∣ers to God, that those may be succeeded, who are em∣ploy'd in this arduous Work: And also because I persuade my self that the Tidings of the Gospel's spreading a∣mong the poor Heathen, will be, to those who are wait∣ing for the Accomplishment of the <HI>Glorious Things spoken of the City of our God,</HI> as <HI>good News from a far Country:</HI> And that <HI>these</HI> will be so far from <HI>despising the Day of small Things,</HI> that on the contrary the least Dawn of Encou∣ragement and Hope, in this important Affair, will rather inspire their pious Breasts with more generous and warm Desires, that <HI>the Kingdoms of this World,</HI> may speedily <HI>be∣come the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ.</HI></P>
<P>I shall therefore immediately proceed to the Business be∣fore me, and briefly touch upon the most important Mat∣ters, that have concern'd my Mission, from the Beginning to this present Time.</P>
<P>On <HI>March</HI> 15, 1743. I waited on the Correspondents for the <HI>Indian</HI> Mission at <HI>New-York</HI>; and the Week fol∣lowing, attended their Meeting at <HI>Woodbridge</HI> in <HI>New-Jer∣sey,</HI> and was speedily dismissed by them with Orders to at∣tempt the Instruction of a Number of <HI>Indians</HI> in a Place some Miles distant from the City of <HI>Albany.</HI> And on the first Day of <HI>April</HI> following, I arrived among the <HI>Indians,</HI> at a Place call'd by them <HI>Kaunaumeek,</HI> in the County of <HI>Albany,</HI> near about twenty Miles distant from the City Eastward.</P>
<P>The Place, as to its Situation, was sufficiently lonesome, and unpleasant, being incompassed with Mountains, and Woods; twenty Miles distant from any <HI>English</HI> Inhabi∣tants;
<PB N="26" REF="005471_0032_101839008D3FEC08"/>
six, or seven from any <HI>Dutch</HI>; and more than two from a Family that came, some Time since, from the Highlands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had then liv'd (as I remem∣ber) about two Years in this Wilderness. In this Family I lodg'd about the Space of three Months, the Master of it being the only Person with whom I could readily con∣verse in those Parts, except my Interpreter; others under∣standing very little <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>After I had spent about three Months in this Situation, I found my Distance from the <HI>Indians</HI> a very great Dis∣advantage to my Work amongst them, and very burden∣some to my self; as I was oblig'd to travel forward and backward almost daily on Foot, having no Pasture in which I could keep my Horse for that Purpose. And after all my Pains, could not be with the <HI>Indians</HI> in the E∣vening and Morning, which were usually the best Hours to find them at home, and when they could best attend my Instructions.</P>
<P>I therefore resolv'd to remove, and live with or near the <HI>Indians,</HI> that I might watch all Opportunities, when they were generally at Home, and take the Advantage of such Seasons for their Instruction.</P>
<P>Accordingly I removed soon after; and, for a Time, liv'd with them in one of their <HI>Wigwams</HI>: and not long after, built me a small House, where I spent the Remain∣der of that Year intirely alone; my Interpreter (who was an <HI>Indian</HI>) choosing rather to live in a Wigwam among his own Country-Men.</P>
<P>This Way of living I found attended with many Diffi∣culties, and uncomfortable Circumstances, in a Place where I could get none of the Necessaries and common Com∣forts of Life (no, not so much as a Morsel of Bread) but what I brought from Places fifteen and twenty Miles dis∣tant, and oftentimes was oblig'd, for some Time together to content my self without, for Want of an Opportunity to procure the Things I needed.</P>
<P>But although the Difficulties of this solitary Way of li∣ving are not the least, or most inconsiderable, (and doubt∣less

are in Fact many more and greater to those who <HI>ex∣perience,</HI> than they can readily <HI>appear</HI> to those, who only view them at a Distance) yet I can truly say, that the Burden I felt respecting my <HI>great Work</HI> among the poor <HI>Indians,</HI> the Fear and Concern that continually hung up∣on my Spirit, lest they should be prejudic'd against Chri∣stianity, and their Minds imbitter'd against me, and my Labours among them, by Means of the Insinuations of some who (although they are call'd <HI>Christians</HI>) seem to have no Concern for CHRIST's <HI>Kingdom,</HI> but had rather (as their Conduct plainly discovers) that the <HI>Indians</HI> should remain Heathens, that they may with the more Ease cheat, and so inrich themselves by them; The Burden, I say, the Fear, and Concern I felt in these Re∣spects were much more pressing to me, than all the Difficulties that attended the Circumstances of my liv∣ing.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>State</HI> or <HI>Temper of Mind,</HI> in which I found these <HI>Indians,</HI> at my first coming among them, I may just∣ly say, it was much more desireable, and encouraging, than what appears among those who are altogether un∣cultivated. Their Heathenish Jealousies and Suspicion and their Prejudices against Christianity, were in a great Measure remov'd by the long continued Labours of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Sargeant</HI> among a Number of the same Tribe, in a Place little more than twenty Miles distant: by which Means these were, in some good Degree, prepar'd to entertain the Truths of Christianity, instead of object∣ing against them, and appearing almost intirely untracta∣ble, as is common with them at first and as per∣haps these appear'd a few Years ago. Some of them, at least, appear'd very well dispos'd toward Religion, and seem'd much pleas'd with my coming among them.</P>
<P>In my Labours with them, in Order <HI>to turn them from Darkness to Light,</HI> I studied what was most <HI>plain,</HI> and <HI>easy,</HI> and best suited to their Capacities: and endeavour'd to set before them from Time to Time (as they were a∣ble
<PB N="28" REF="005471_0034_1018390749726948"/>
to receive them) the most <HI>important,</HI> and <HI>necessary</HI> Truths of Christianity; such as most immediately con∣cern'd their speedy Conversion to God, and such as I judg'd had the greatest Tendency (as means) to effect that glorious Change in them. But especially I made it the <HI>Scope</HI> and <HI>Drift</HI> of all my Labours, to lead them into a thorow Acquaintance with these two Things. — First, the <HI>Sinfulness</HI> and <HI>Misery</HI> of the Estate they were <HI>natural∣ly</HI> in: The Evil of their Hearts, the Pollution of their Natures: The heavy Guilt they were under, and their Exposedness to everlasting Punishment; as also their ut∣ter Inability to save themselves, either from their Sins, or from those Miseries which are the just Punishment of them; and their Unworthiness of any Mercy at the Hand of God, on Account of any Thing they them∣selves could do to procure his Favour, and consequently their extreme Need of CHRIST to save them. — And, Secondly, I frequently endeavoured to open to them the <HI>Fulness, Alsufficiency,</HI> and <HI>Freeness</HI> of that <HI>Redemption,</HI> which the SON of GOD has wrought out by his Obedi∣ence and Sufferings, for perishing Sinners: How this Pro∣vision he had made, was suited to all their Wants; and how he call'd and invited them to accept of everlasting Life freely, notwithstanding all their Sinfulness, Inability, Unworthiness, &amp;c.</P>
<P>After I had been with the <HI>Indians</HI> several Months, I compos'd sundry <HI>Forms of Prayer,</HI> adapted to their Cir∣cumstances and Capacities; which with the Help of my Interpreter, I translated into the <HI>Indian</HI> Language; and soon learn'd to pronounce their Words so as to pray with them in their own Tongue. I also translated sundry <HI>Psalms</HI> into their Language, and soon after we were able to sing in the Worship of God.</P>
<P>When my People had gained some Acquaintance with many of the Truths of Christianity, so that they were capable of receiving, and understanding many others, which at first could not be taught them, by Reason of their Ignorance of those that were necessary to be previ∣viously
<PB N="29" REF="005471_0035_1018390C07A19148"/>
known, and upon which others depended; I then gave them an <HI>historical</HI> Account of God's Dealings with his ancient professing People, the <HI>Jews</HI>: Some of the Rites, and Ceremonies, they were obliged to observe, as their Sacrifices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And what these were design'd to represent to them: As also some of the surprizing Mi∣racles God wrought for their Salvation, while they trust∣ed in him, and the sore Punishments he sometimes bro't upon them, when they forsook and sinn'd against him. Afterwards I proceeded to give them a Relation of the Birth, Life, Miracles, Sufferings, Death, and Resur∣rection of CHRIST: as well as his Ascension, and the wonderful Effusion of the Holy SPIRIT consequent thereupon.</P>
<P>And having thus endeavour'd to prepare the Way by such a general Account of Things, I next proceeded to read, and <HI>expound</HI> to them the Gospel of St. <HI>Matthew</HI> (at least the Substance of it) in Course, wherein they had a more distinct, and particular View of what they had be∣fore some general Notion of.</P>
<P>These Expositions I attended almost every <HI>Evening,</HI> when there was any considerable Number of them at Home; except when I was obliged to be absent my self, in Order to learn the <HI>Indian</HI> Language with the Rev. Mr. <HI>Sargeant.</HI>— Besides these Means of Instruction, there was likewise an <HI>English School</HI> constantly kept by my In∣terpreter among the <HI>Indians</HI>: which I us'd frequently to visit, in Order to give the Children and young People some proper Instructions, and serious Exhortations suited to their Age.</P>
<P>The Degree of <HI>Knowledge</HI> to which some of them at∣tain'd, was considerable. Many of the Truths of Chri∣stianity seem'd fix'd in their Minds, (especially in some Instances,) so that they would speak to me of them, and ask such Questions about them, as were necessary to render them more plain and clear to their Understand∣ings.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="005471_0036_1018390F31DBDAE0"/>The Children also, and young People, who attended the <HI>School,</HI> made considerable Proficiency (at least some of them) in their Learning; so that had they understood the <HI>English</HI> Language well, they would have been able to read somewhat readily in a <HI>Psalter.</HI></P>
<P>But that which was most of all desirable, and gave me the greatest Encouragement amidst many Difficulties and disconsolate Hours, was, that the Truths of God's Word seem'd, at Times, to be attended with some <HI>Power</HI> upon the Hearts and Consciences of the <HI>Indians.</HI> And especi∣ally this appeared evident in a few Instances, who were awaken'd to some Sense of their miserable Estate by Na∣ture, and appear'd solicitous for Deliverance from it. Several of them came, of their own Accord, to discourse with me about their Soul's Concerns; and some, with Tears, enquired <HI>what they should do to be saved?</HI> And whether the GOD that Christians serv'd, would be merciful to those that had been frequently drunk, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And although I can't say, I have satisfactory Evidences of their being <HI>renewed in the Spirit of their Mind,</HI> and savingly converted to God, yet the Spirit of God did (I apprehend) in such a Manner attend the Means of Grace, and so operate upon their Minds thereby, as might justly afford Matter of Encouragement to hope, that God design∣ed Good to them, and that he was preparing his Way in∣to their Souls.</P>
<P>There likewise appeared a <HI>Reformation</HI> in the Lives and Manners of the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Their idolatrous <HI>Sacrifices</HI> (of which there was but one or two, that I know of, after my coming among them) were wholly laid aside. And their Heathenish Custom of <HI>Dancing, Halloeing,</HI> &amp;c. they seem'd in a considerable Measure broken off from. And I could not but hope, that they were reform'd in some Measure from the Sin of <HI>Drunkenness.</HI> They likewise manifested a Regard to the <HI>Lord's Day</HI>: And not only behav'd soberly them∣selves,
<PB N="31" REF="005471_0037_10183910C4AA4E30"/>
but took Care also to keep their <HI>Children</HI> in Or∣der.</P>
<P>Yet after all I must confess, that as there were many hope∣ful Appearances among them, so there were some Things more <HI>discouraging.</HI> And while I rejoic'd to observe any Seriousness, and Concern among them about the Affairs of their Souls, still I was not without continual Fear and Concern, lest such encouraging Appearances might prove <HI>like a Morning-Cloud, that passeth a∣way.</HI></P>
<P>When I had spent near a Year with the <HI>Indians,</HI> I in∣form'd them that I expected to leave them in the Spring then approaching, and to be sent to another Tribe of <HI>In∣dians,</HI> at a great Distance from them: Upon hearing of which they appear'd very sorrowful, and some of them endeavour'd to perswade me to continue with them; urg∣ing that they had now heard so much about their <HI>Souls Concerns,</HI> that they could never more be willing to live as they had done, without a <HI>Minister,</HI> and further Instructi∣ons in the Way to Heaven, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whereupon I told them, they ought to be willing that others also should hear about their Soul's Concerns, seeing those needed it as much as themselves. Yet further to dissuade me from going, they added, that those <HI>Indians,</HI> to whom I had Thoughts of going (as they had heard) were not willing to become <HI>Christians,</HI> as <HI>they</HI> were, and therefore urged me to tarry with them. I then told them, that <HI>they</HI> might receive further Instruction without me; but the <HI>Indians,</HI> to whom I expected to be sent, could not, there being no Minister near to teach them. And hereupon I advised them, in Case I should leave them, and be sent otherwhere, to remove to <HI>Stockbridge,</HI> where they might be supplied with Land, and Conveniences of Living, and be under the Ministry of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Sargeant</HI>: Which Advice, and Proposal, they seem'd disposed to comply with.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="005471_0038_101839146FA49FF0"/>On <HI>April</HI> 6, 1744. I was order'd and directed by the Correspondents for the <HI>Indian</HI> Mission, to take Leave of the People, with whom I had then spent a full Year, and to go (as soon as conveniently I could) to a Tribe of <HI>Indians</HI> on <HI>Delaware</HI>-River in <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></P>
<P>These Orders I soon attended, and on <HI>April</HI> 29th took Leave of my People, who were mostly remov'd to <HI>Stockbridge</HI> under the Care of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Sargeant.</HI> I then set out on my Journey toward <HI>Delaware</HI>; and on <HI>May</HI> tenth, met with a Number of <HI>Indians</HI> in a Place called <HI>Minnissinks,</HI> about an hundred and forty Miles from <HI>Kau∣naumeek</HI> (the Place where I spent the last Year) and di∣rectly in my Way to <HI>Delaware</HI>-River. With these <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> I spent some Time, and first address'd their <HI>King</HI> in a friendly Manner; and after some Discourse, and At∣tempts to contract a Friendship with him, I told him I had a Desire (for his Benefit and Happiness) to instruct them in <HI>Christianity.</HI> At which he laugh'd, turn'd his Back upon me, and went away. I then address'd another <HI>Principal</HI> Man in the same Manner, who said he was wil∣ling to hear me. After some Time, I follow'd the <HI>King</HI> into his House, and renew'd my Discourse to him: but he declin'd talking, and left the Affair to another, who appeared to be a rational Man. He began, and talked very warmly near a Quarter of an Hour together: he en∣quired why I desir'd the <HI>Indians</HI> to become <HI>Christians,</HI> seeing the Christians were so much worse than the <HI>Indians</HI> are in their present State. The Christians, he said, would lie, steal, and drink, worse than the <HI>Indians.</HI> 'Twas <HI>they</HI> first taught the <HI>Indians</HI> to be drunk: And <HI>they</HI> stole from one another, to that Degree, that their Rulers were obli∣ged to hang them for it, and that was not sufficient to de∣ter others from the like Practice. But the <HI>Indians,</HI> he added, were none of them ever hang'd for Stealing, and yet they did not steal half so much; and he suppos'd that if the <HI>Indians</HI> should become Christians, they would then be as bad as these. And hereupon he said, they would live as their <HI>Fathers</HI> liv'd, and go where their <HI>Fathers</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="005471_0039_10183919CDCB7A98"/>
were when they died. I then freely <HI>owned, lamented,</HI> and join'd with him in <HI>condemning</HI> the ill Conduct of some, who are called <HI>Christians</HI>: told him, these were not <HI>Chris∣tians</HI> in <HI>Heart</HI>; that I hated such wicked Practices, and did not desire the <HI>Indians</HI> to become such as these.—And when he appear'd calmer, I ask'd him if he was willing, that I should come and see them again: he replied, he should be willing to see me again: as a <HI>Friend,</HI> if I would not desire 'em to become <HI>Christians.</HI>—I then bid them farewell, and prosecuted my Journey toward <HI>Delaware.</HI> And <HI>May</HI> 13th I arrived at a Place called by the Indians, <HI>Sakhauwotung,</HI> within the Forks of <HI>Delaware</HI> in <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></P>
<P>Here also, when I came to the <HI>Indians,</HI> I saluted their <HI>King,</HI> and others, in a Manner I thought most engaging. And soon after informed the <HI>King</HI> of my Desire to instruct them in the <HI>Christian Religion.</HI> After he had consulted a few Minutes with two or three old Men, he told me, he was willing to hear. I then preach'd to those few that were present: who appear'd very attentive, and well-dispo∣sed. And the <HI>King</HI> in particular seemed both to wonder, and at the same Time to be well pleas'd with what I taught them, respecting the DIVINE BEING, &amp;c. And since that Time he has ever shewn himself friendly to me, giving me free Liberty to preach in his House, whenever I think fit.—Here therefore I have spent the greater Part of the Summer past, preaching usually in the <HI>King</HI>'s House.</P>
<P>The <HI>Number</HI> of <HI>Indians</HI> in this Place, is but small: most of those that formerly belong'd here, are dispers'd, and remov'd to Places farther back in the Country. There are not more than ten Houses hereabouts, that continue to be inhabited; and some of these are several Miles dis∣tant from others, which makes it difficult for the <HI>Indians</HI> to meet together so frequently as could be desir'd.</P>
<P>When I first began to preach here, the Number of my <HI>Hearers</HI> was very small; often not exceeding twenty or twenty-five Persons: But towards the latter Part of the Summer, their Number increas'd, so that I have frequently had forty Persons, or more at once: and oftentimes the
<PB N="34" REF="005471_0040_1018391B64A5CA48"/>
most of those belonging to those Parts, came together to hear me preach.</P>
<P>The <HI>Effects</HI> which the Truths of God's Word have had upon some of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in this Place, are somewhat encouraging. Sundry of them are brought to renounce <HI>Idolatry,</HI> and to decline partaking of those <HI>Feasts</HI> which they used to offer in Sacrifice to certain supposed unknown Powers. And some few Instances among them have, for a considerable Time, manifest∣ed a serious Concern for their Soul's eternal Welfare, and still continue to <HI>enquire the Way to Zion,</HI> with such Di∣ligence, Affection, and becoming Solicitude, as gives me Reason to hope, that <HI>God who</HI> (I trust) <HI>has begun this Work in them,</HI> will carry it on, until it shall issue in their saving Conversion to himself. These not only detest their old idolatrous Notions, but strive also to bring their Friends off from them. And as they are seeking Salvation for their own Souls, so they seem desirous, and some of them take Pains, that others might be excited to do the like.</P>
<P>In <HI>July</HI> last I heard of a Number of <HI>Indians</HI> residing at a Place (call'd <HI>Kauksésauchung</HI>) more than thirty Miles Westward from the Place where I usually preach. I vi∣sited them, found about thirty Persons, and proposed my Desire of preaching to them: they readily comply'd, and I preach'd them only twice; they being just then remo∣ving from this Place (where they only liv'd for the pre∣sent) to <HI>Susquahannah</HI>-River where they belong'd.</P>
<P>While I was preaching, they appear'd sober, and atten∣tive; and were somewhat surpriz'd, having never before heard of these Things. There were two or three, who suspected that I had some ill Design upon them; and urg'd, that the <HI>white</HI> People had abus'd them, and taken their Lands from them, and therefore they had no Reason to think that they were now concern'd for their Happi∣ness: But on the contrary, that they design'd to make them Slaves, or get them on board their Vessels, and make them fight with the People over the Water (as they ex∣press'd it) meaning the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> However,
<PB N="35" REF="005471_0041_1018391FB0B285B0"/>
the most of them appear'd very friendly, and told me, they were then going directly home to <HI>Susquahannah,</HI> and desired I would make them a Visit there, and manifested a considerable Desire of farther Instruction.</P>
<P>This Invitation gave me some Encouragement in my great Work; and made me hope, that God design'd to <HI>open an effectual Door to me</HI> for spreading the Gospel a∣mong the poor Heathen farther Westward.</P>
<P>In the Beginning of <HI>October</HI> last, with the Advice and Direction of the Correspondents for the <HI>Indian Mission,</HI> I undertook a Journey to <HI>Susquahannah.</HI> And after three Days tedious Travel, two of them thro' a Wilderness al∣most unpassable by Reason of Mountains and Rocks, and two Nights lodging in the open Wilderness, I came to an <HI>Indian</HI> Settlement on the Side of <HI>Susquahan∣nah</HI>-River, call'd <HI>Opeholhaupung</HI>: where were twelve Indi∣an Houses, and (as nigh as I could learn) about seventy Souls, old and young, belonging to them.</P>
<P>Here also, soon after my Arrival, I visited the <HI>King,</HI> addressing him with Expressions of Kindness: and after a few Words of Friendship, inform'd him of my Desire to teach them the Knowledge of <HI>Christianity.</HI> He hesitated not long before he told me, that he was willing to hear. I then preached, and continu'd there several Days, preaching every Day, as long as the <HI>Indians</HI> were at Home. And they in order to hear me, deferr'd the Design of their ge∣neral Hunting (which they were just then entering upon) for the Space of three or four Days.</P>
<P>The <HI>Men,</HI> I think, universally (except one) attended my Preaching. Only, the <HI>Women,</HI> supposing the Affair we were upon was of a publick Nature, belonging only to the Men, and not what every individual Person should concern himself with, could not readily be persuaded to come and hear: but, after much Pains used with them for that Purpose, some few ventured to come, and stand at a Distance.</P>
<P>When I had preach'd to the <HI>Indians</HI> several Times, some of them very frankly proposed what they had to ob∣ject
<PB N="36" REF="005471_0042_101839248C80B2E8"/>
against <HI>Christianity</HI>; and so gave me a fair Opportu∣nity for using my best Endeavours to remove from their Minds those Scruples and Jealousies they laboured under: And when I had endeavour'd to answer their Objections, some appeared much satisfied. I then asked the <HI>King</HI> if he was willing I should visit, and preach to them again, if I should live to the next Spring: He replied, he should be heartily willing for his own Part, and added, he wish'd the young People would learn <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I then put the same Question to the rest: Some answered, they should be very glad, and none manifested any dislike to it.</P>
<P>There were sundry other Things in their Behaviour, which appeared with a comfortable, and encouraging As∣pect; that, upon the whole, I could not but rejoice I had taken that Journey among them, altho' it was at∣tended with many Difficulties and Hardships. The Me∣thod I used with them, and the Instructions I gave them (I am persuaded) were Means in some Measure, to re∣move their heathenish Jealousies, and Prejudices against Christianity: And I could not but hope, <HI>the God of all Grace</HI> was preparing their Minds to receive <HI>the Truth as it is in Jesus.</HI> If this may be the happy Consequence, I shall not only rejoice in my past Labours and Fatigues; but shall, I trust, also <HI>be willing to spend and be spend,</HI> if I may thereby be instrumental <HI>to turn them from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, <HI>Sir,</HI> I have given you a faithful Account of what has been most considerable respecting my Mission a∣mong the <HI>Indians</HI>; in which I have studied all convenient Brevity. I shall only now take leave to add a Word or two respecting the <HI>Difficulties</HI> that attend the Christiani∣zing of these poor Pagans.</P>
<P>In the first Place, Their Minds are fill'd with <HI>Prejudices</HI> against <HI>Christianity,</HI> on Account of the <HI>vicious</HI> Lives and <HI>un∣christian</HI> Behaviour of some that are call'd <HI>Christians.</HI> These not only set before them the worst Examples, but some of them take Pains, expresly in Words, to dissuade them from becoming Christians; foreseeing, that if these should be
<PB N="37" REF="005471_0043_10183926DF98EDA0"/>
converted to God, <HI>the Hope of their</HI> unlawful <HI>Gain</HI> would thereby be lost.</P>
<P>Again, These poor Heathens are extremely attach'd to the Customs, Traditions and fabulous Notions of their <HI>Fa∣thers.</HI> And this one seems to be the Foundation of all their other Notions, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>'twas not the same GOD made them, who made the White People,</HI> but another who commanded them to live by <HI>Hunting,</HI> &amp;c. and not conform to the Customs of the <HI>white</HI> People.— Hence when they are desir'd to become Christians, they frequent∣ly reply, that <HI>they will live as their Fathers liv'd, and go to their Fathers, when they die.</HI> And if the <HI>Miracles</HI> of Christ and his Apostles be mentioned, to prove the Truth of Christianity; They also mention sundry Miracles, which their Fathers have told them were anciently wro't among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and which Satan makes them believe were so.—They are much attach'd to <HI>Idolatry</HI>: Frequent∣ly making <HI>Feasts,</HI> which they eat in Honour to some <HI>un∣known</HI> Beings, who, they suppose, speak to them in <HI>Dreams</HI>; promising them Success in Hunting, and other Affairs, in Case they will sacrifice to them. They oftentimes also offer their Sacrifices to the <HI>Spirits</HI> of the <HI>Dead</HI>; who, they suppose, stand in Need of Favours from the Living, and yet are in such a State as that they can well reward all the Offices of Kindness that are shewn them. And they impute all their Calamities to the Neglect of these Sa∣crifices.</P>
<P>Furthermore, they are much awed by those among themselves, who are call'd <HI>Powwaws,</HI> who are supposed to have a Power of Inchanting, or poysoning them to Death, or at least in a very distressing Manner. And they apprehend it would be their sad Fate to be thus inchanted, in Case they should become Christians.</P>
<P>Lastly, The <HI>Manner of their living</HI> is likewise a great Disadvantage to the Design of their being Christianized. They are almost continually roving from Place to Place; and 'tis but rare, that an Opportunity can be had with some of them for their Instruction. There is scarce
<PB N="38" REF="005471_0044_1018392B85AD4710"/>
any Time of the Year, wherein the <HI>Men</HI> can be found generally at home, except about six Weeks before, and in, the Season of planting their Corn, and about two Months in the latter Part of Summer, from the Time they begin to road their Corn, until 'tis fit to gather in.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Hardships</HI> that necessarily attend a Mission among them, the Fatigues of frequent Journeying in the Wilderness, the Unpleasantness of a mean and hard Way of Living, and the great Difficulty of addressing <HI>a People of a strange Language,</HI> these I shall, at present, pass over in Silence; designing what I have already said of Difficulties attending this Work, not for the Discouragement of <HI>any,</HI> but rather for the Incitement of <HI>all,</HI> who <HI>live the Appear∣ing and Kingdom of Christ,</HI> to frequent the Throne of Grace with earnest Supplications, that the <HI>Heathen,</HI> who were anciently <HI>promised</HI> to Christ <HI>for his Inheritance,</HI> may now <HI>actually</HI> and <HI>speedily</HI> be brought into his Kingdom of Grace, and made Heirs of immortal Glory. —</P>
