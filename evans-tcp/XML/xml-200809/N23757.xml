<HEAD>TREATY OF AMITY, COMMERCE AND NAVIGATION, Between his Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, By their President, with the advice and consent of their Senate.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, being desirous by a treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, to terminate their differences in such a manner, as without reference to the merits of their respective complaints and pretensions, may be the best calculated to produce mutual satisfaction and good understanding; and also to regulate the commerce and navigation between their respective countries, territories and people, in such a manner as to render the same re∣ciprocally beneficial and satisfactory; they have, respec∣tively, named their plenipotentiaries, and given them full powers to treat of, and conclude, the said treaty, that is to say; his Britannic Majesty has named for his ple∣nipotentiary, the Right Honorable William Wynd∣ham Baron Grenville of Wotton, one of his Majesty's Privy Council, and his Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; and the President of the said United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, hath appointed for their plenipoten∣tiary, the Honorable John Jay, Chief Justice of the said United States and their envoy extraordinary to his Ma∣jesty, who have agreed on and concluded the following articles.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE I.</HEAD>
<P>There shall be a firm, inviolable and universal peace, and a true and sincere friendship between his Britannic Majesty, his heirs and successors, and the United States of America; and between their respective countries, territories, cities, towns and people of every degree, without exception of persons or places.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE II.</HEAD>
<P>His Majesty will withdraw all his troops and garri∣sons from all posts and places within the boundary lines assigned by the treaty of peace to the United States. This evacuation shall take place on or before the first day of June one thousand seven hundred and ninety-six, and all the proper measures shall in the interval be taken by concert between the government of the United States, and his Majesty's Governor General in America, for settling the previous arrangements which may be neces∣sary respecting the delivery of the said posts: The Uni∣ted States in the mean time at their discretion, extend∣ing their settlements to any part within the said bounda∣ry line, except within the precincts or jurisdiction of any of the said posts. All settlers and traders, within the precincts or jurisdiction of the said posts, shall con∣tinue to enjoy, unmolested, all their property of every kind, and shall be protected therein. They shall be at full liberty to remain there, or to remove with all or any part of their effects; and it shall also be free to them to sell their lands, houses, or effects, or to retain the property thereof, at their discretion; such of them as shall continue to reside within the said boundary lines, shall not be compelled to become citizens of the United States, or to take any oath of allegiance to the govern∣ment thereof, but they shall be at full liberty so to do if they think proper, and they shall make and declare their election within one year after the evacuation afore∣said. And all persons who shall continue there after the expiration of the said year, without having declared their intention of remaining subjects of his Britannic Ma∣jesty, shall be considered as having elected to become citizens of the United States.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE III.</HEAD>
<P>It is agreed that it shall at all times be free to his Ma∣jesty's subjects, and to the citizens of the United States, and also to the Indians dwelling on either side of the said boundary line, freely to pass and repass by land or
<PB N="7" REF="031411_0005_0FEC50EF4EBD6060"/>
inland navigation, into the respective territories and countries of the two parties, on the continent of Ame∣rica (the country within the limits of the Hudson's bay Company only excepted) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers and waters thereof, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other. But it is understood, that this article does not extend to the admission of ves∣sels of the United States into the sea ports, harbours, bays, or creeks of his Majesty's said territories; nor in∣to such parts of the rivers in his Majesty's said territories as are between the mouth thereof, and the highest port of entry from the sea, except in small vessels trading bona side between Montreal and Quebec, under such regula∣tions as shall be established to prevent the possibility of any frauds in this respect. Nor to the admission of British vessels from the sea into the rivers of the United States, beyond the highest ports of entry for foreign vessels from the sea. The river Missisippi, shall, how∣ever, according to the treaty of peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its eastern side, to whichsoever of the parties belonging, may freely be resorted to and used by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the At∣lantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his Majesty in Great-Britain.</P>
<P>All goods and merchandize whose importation into his Majesty's said territories in America, shall not be en∣tirely prohibited, may freely, for the purposes of com∣merce, be carried into the same in the manner aforesaid, by the citizens of the United States, and such goods and merchandize shall be subject to no higher or other duties, than would be payable by his Majesty's subjects on the importation of the same from Europe into the said territories. And in like manner, all goods and mer∣chandize whose importation into the United States shall not be wholly prohibited, may freely, for the purposes of commerce, be carried into the same, in the manner aforesaid, by his Majesty's subjects, and such goods and merchandize shall be subject to no higher or other du∣ties,
<PB N="8" REF="031411_0006_0FEC50F30C7ED658"/>
than would be payable by the citizens of the Uni∣ted States on the importation of the same in American vessels into the Atlantic ports of the said States. And all goods not prohibited to be exported from the said territories respectively, may in like manner be carried out of the same by the two parties respectively, paying duty as aforesaid.</P>
<P>No duty of entry shall ever be levied by either party on peltries brought by land, or inland navigation into the said territories respectively, nor shall the Indians passing or repassing with their own proper goods and ef∣fects of whatever nature, pay for the same any impost or duty whatever. But goods in bales, or other large packages unusual among Indians shall not be considered as goods belonging bona fide to Indians.</P>
<P>No higher or other tolls or rates of ferriage than what are or shall be payable by natives, shall be demanded on either side; and no duties shall be payable on any goods which shall merely be carried over any of the portages or carrying places on either side; for the purpose of being immediately reimbarked and carried to some other place or places. But as by this stipulation it is only meant to secure to each party a free passage across the portages on both sides; it is agreed, that this exemption from duty shall extend only to such goods as are carried in the usual and direct road across the portage, and are not attempted to be in any manner sold or exchanged during their passage across the same, and proper regula∣tions may be established to prevent the possibility of any frauds in this respect.</P>
<P>As this article is intended to render in a great degree the local advantages of each party common to both, and thereby to promote a disposition favorable to friendship and good neighbourhood, it is agreed, that the respective governments will mutually promote this amicable intercourse, by causing speedy and impartial justice to be done, and necessary protection to be ex∣tended to all who may be concerned therein.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE IV.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas it is uncertain whether the river Missisippi extends so far to the northward as to be intersected by a line to be drawn due west from the Lake of the Woods, in the manner mentioned in the treaty of peace between his Majesty and the United States; it is agreed, that measures shall be taken in concert between his Majes∣ty's government in America and the government of the United States, for making a joint survey of the said river from one degree of latitude below the Falls of St. Anthony, to the principal source or sources of the said river and also of the parts adjacent thereto; and that if on the result of such survey, it should appear that the said river, would not be intersected by such a line as is above mentioned, the two parties will thereupon pro∣ceed by amicable negociation, to regulate the bounda∣ry line in that quarter, as well as all other points to be adjusted between the said parties, according to justice and mutual convenience, and in conformity to the in∣tent of the said treaty.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE V.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas doubts have arisen what river was truly in∣tended under the name of the river St. Croix, mention∣ed in the said treaty of peace, and forming a part of the boundary therein described; that question shall be re∣ferred to the final decision of commissioners to be ap∣pointed in the following manner, viz.</P>
<P>One commissioner shall be named by his Majesty, and one by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and the said two commissioners shall agree on the choice of a third; or if they cannot so agree, they shall each pro∣pose one person, and of the two names so proposed, one shall be drawn by lot in the presence of the two origi∣nal commissioners. And the three commissioners so ap∣pointed, shall be sworn, impartially to examine and de∣cide the said question, according to such evidence as
<PB N="10" REF="031411_0008_0FEC50FBC5D2B518"/>
shall respectively be laid before them on the part of the British government and of the United States. The said commissioners shall meet at Halifax, and shall have power to adjourn to such other place or places as they shall think fit. They shall have power to appoint a se∣cretary, and to employ such surveyors or other persons as they shall judge necessary. The said commissioners shall by a declaration under their hands and seals de∣cide what river is the river St. Croix intended by the treaty. The said declaration shall contain a descrip∣tion of the said river, and shall particularize the lati∣tude and longitude of its mouth and of its source. Duplicates of this declaration and of the statements of their accounts, and of the journal of their proceedings shall be delivered by them to the agent of his Majesty, and to the agent of the United States, who may be re∣spectively appointed and authorized to manage the bu∣siness on behalf of the respective governments. And both parties agree to consider such decision as final and conclusive, so as that the same shall never thereafter be called into question, or made the subject of dispute or difference between them.</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE VI.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas it is alledged by divers British merchants and others his Majesty's subjects, that debts to a conside∣rable amount, which were bona fide contracted before the peace, still remain owing to them by citizens or inhabitants of the United States, and that by the ope∣ration of various lawful impediments since the peace, not only the full recovery of the said debts has been de∣layed, but also the value and security thereof have been, in several instances, impaired and lessened, so that by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the British creditors cannot now obtain, and actually have and re∣ceive full and adequate compensation for the losses and damages which they have thereby sustained. It is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reed, that in all such cases where full compensation for such losses and damages cannot for whatever reason
<PB N="11" REF="031411_0009_0FEC50FDC41A00C8"/>
be actually obtained, had and received by the said cre∣ditors in the ordinary course of justice, the United States will make full and complete compensation for the same to the said creditors: But is distinctly understood, that this provision is to extend to such losses only as have been occasioned by the lawful impediments aforesaid, and is not to extend to losses occasioned by such insol∣vency of the debtors, or other causes as would equal∣ly have operated to produce such loss, if the said impe∣diments had not existed; nor to such losses or damages as have been occasioned by the manifest delay or neg∣ligence, or wilful omission of the claimant.</P>
<P>For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of any such losses and damages, five commissioners shall be ap∣pointed, and authorized to meet and act in manner fol∣lowing, viz. Two of them shall be appointed by his Majesty, two of them by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Se∣nate thereof, and the fifth by the unanimous voice of the other four; and if they should not agree in such choice, then the commissioners named by the two par∣ties shall respectively propose one person, and of the two names so proposed, one shall be drawn by lot in the presence of the four original commissioners. When the five commissioners thus appointed shall first meet, they shall, before they proceed to act, respectively take the following oath or affirmation, in the presence of each other, which oath or affirmation being so taken and duly attested, shall be entered on the record of their proceedings, viz. I <HI>A. B.</HI> one of the commissioners appointed in pursuance of the sixth article of the treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, between his Bri∣tannic Majesty and the United States of America, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will honestly, diligently, impartially, and carefully examine, and to the best of my judgment, according to justice and equity, decide all such complaints, as under the said article shall be pre∣ferred to the said commissioners: and that I will forbear to act as a commissioner, in any case in which I may be personally interested.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="031411_0010_0FEC5104707BF4F0"/>Three of the said commissioners shall constitute a board, and shall have power to do any act appertaining to the said commission, provided that one of the com∣missioners named on each side, and the fifth commissioner shall be present, and all decisions shall be made by the majority of the voices of the commissioners then present. Eighteen months from the day on which the said com∣missioners shall form a board, and be ready to proceed to business, are assigned for receiving complaints and applications; but they are nevertheless authorized in any particular cases in which it shall appear to them to be reasonable and just, to extend the said term of eighteen months, for any term not exceeding six months, after the expiration thereof. The said commissioners shall first meet at Philadelphia, but they shall have power to adjourn from place to place as they shall see cause.</P>
<P>The said commissioners in examining the complaints and applications so preferred to them, are empowered and required, in pursuance of the true intent and mean∣ing of this article, to take into their consideration all claims, whether of principal or interest, or balances of principal and interest, and to determine the same respec∣tively, according to the merits of the several cases, due regard being had to all the circumstances thereof, and as equity and justice shall appear to them to require. And the said commissioners shall have power to examine all such persons as shall come before them, on oath or affirmation touching the premises; and also to receive in evidence according as they may think most consistent with equity and justice, all written depositions, or books, or papers, or copies, or extracts thereof, every such de∣position, book, or paper, or copy, or extract, being duly authenticated, either according to the legal forms now respectively existing in the two countries, or in such other manner as the said commissioners shall see cause to require or allow.</P>
<P>The award of the said commissioners or of any three of them as aforesaid, shall in all cases be final and con∣clusive, both as to the justice of the claim, and to the
<PB N="13" REF="031411_0011_0FEC514E6B656000"/>
amount of the sum to be paid to the creditor or claim∣ant: And the United States undertake to cause the sum so awarded to be paid in specie to such creditor or claim∣ant without deduction; and at such time or times, and at such place or places as shall be awarded by the said commissioners; and on condition of such releases or assignments to be given by the creditor or claimant, as by the said commissioners may be directed: Provided always, that no such payment shall be fixed by the said commissioners to take place sooner than twelve months from the day of the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE VII.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas complaints have been made by divers mer∣chants and others, citizens of the United States, that during the course of the war in which his Majesty is now engaged, they have sustained considerable losses and da∣mage, by reason of irregular or illegal captures or con∣demnations of their vessels and other property, under colour of authority or commissions from his Majesty, and that from various circumstances belonging to the said cases, adequate compensation for the losses and da∣mages so sustained cannot now be actually obtained, had and received by the ordinary course of judicial proceed∣ings; it is agreed, that in all such cases, where adequate compensation cannot, for whatever reason, be now ac∣tually obtained, had and received by the said merchants and others in the ordinary course of justice, full and complete compensation for the same will be made by the British government to the said complainants. But it is distinctly understood that this provision is not to extend to such losses or damages as have been occasioned by the manifest delay or negligence, or wilful omission of the claimant.</P>
<P>That for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of any such losses and damages, five commissioners shall be appointed and authorized to act in London, exactly
<PB N="14" REF="031411_0012_0FEC515B808D4410"/>
in the manner directed with respect to those mentioned in the preceding article, and after having taken the same oath or affirmation (mutatis mutandis) the same term of eighteen months is also assigned for the reception of claims, and they are in like manner authorized to ex∣tend the same in particular cases. They shall receive testimony, books, papers and evidence in the same la∣titude, and exercise the like discretion and powers re∣specting that subject; and shall decide the claims in question according to the merits of the several cases, and to justice, equity, and the laws of nations. The award of the said commissioners, or any such three of them as aforesaid, shall in all cases, be final and con∣clusive, both as to the justice of the claim, and the amount of the sum to be paid to the claimant; and his Britannic Majesty undertakes to cause the same to be paid to such claimant in specie, without any deduction, at such place or places, and at such time or times as shall be awarded by the said commissioners, and on con∣dition of such releases or assignments to be given by the claimant, as by the said commissioners may be directed.</P>
<P>And whereas certain merchants and others his Ma∣jesty's subjects complain that in the course of the war they have sustained loss and damage, by reason of the capture of their vessels and merchandize, taken within the limits and jurisdiction of the States and brought into the ports of the same, or taken by vessels originally armed in ports of the said States.</P>
<P>It is agreed that in all such cases where restitution shall not have been made agreeably to the tenor of the letter from Mr. Jefferson to Mr. Hammond, dated at Philadelphia, Sept. 5, 1793, a copy of which is an∣nexed to this treaty; the complaints of the parties shall be and hereby are referred to the commissioners to be appointed by virtue of this article, who are hereby authorized and required to proceed in the like man∣ner relative to these as to the other cases committed to them; and the United States undertake to pay to the complainants or claimants in specie, without de∣duction,
<PB N="15" REF="031411_0013_0FEC5106196799E0"/>
the amount of such sums as shall be awarded to them respectively by the said commissioners, and at the times and places which in such awards shall be speci∣fied; and on condition of such releases or assignments to be given by the claimants as in the said awards may be directed: And it is further agreed, that not only the now existing cases of both descriptions, but also all such as shall exist at the time of exchanging the ratifications of this treaty, shall be considered as being within the provisions, intent, and meaning of this article.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE VIII.</HEAD>
<P>It is further agreed, that the commissioners mentioned in this and in the two preceding articles shall be respec∣tively paid in such manner as shall be agreed between the two parties; such agreement being to be settled at the time of the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty. And all other expenses attending the said com∣missions shall be defrayed jointly by the two parties, the same being previously ascertained and allowed by the majority of the commissioners. And in the case of death, sickness or necessary absence, the place of eve∣ry such commissioner respectively shall be supplied in the same manner as such commissioner was first appoin∣ted, and the new commissioners shall take the same oath or affirmation and do the same duties.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="9" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE IX.</HEAD>
<P>It is agreed that British subjects who now hold lands in the territories of the United States, and American citizens who now hold lands in the dominions of his Majesty, shall continue to hold them according to the nature and tenure of their respective estates and titles therein; and may grant, sell or devise the same to whom they please, in like manner as if they were natives; and that neither they nor their heirs or assigns shall, so far as may respect the said lands and the legal remedies in∣cident thereto, be regarded as aliens.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE XII.</HEAD>
<P>His Majesty consents that it shall and may be lawful during the time herein after limited, for the citizens of the United States to carry to any of his Majesty's islands and ports in the West-Indies from the United States, in their own vessels, not being above the burthen of seven∣ty tons, any goods or merchandizes being of the growth, manufacture or produce of the said States, which it is or may be lawful to carry to the said islands or ports from the said States in British vessels; and that the said American vessels shall be subject there to no other or higher tonnage duties or charges, than shall be payable by British vessels in the ports of the United States; and that the cargoes of the said American vessels shall be subject there to no other or higher duties or charges, than shall be payable on the like articles if imported there from the said States in British vessels.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="031411_0015_0FEC51116EB79840"/>And his Majesty also consents, that it shall be lawful for the said American citizens to purchase, load, and carry away in their said vessels to the United States from the said islands and ports, all such articles being of the growth, manufacture or produce of the said islands, as may now by law be carried from thence to the said States in British vessels, and subject only to the same du∣ties and charges on exportation, to which British vessels and their cargoes are or shall be subject in similar cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>Provided always, that the said American vessels do carry and land their cargoes in the United States only, it being expressly agreed and declared, that during the continuance of this article, the United States will pro∣hibit and restrain the carrying any molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa or cotton in American vessels, either from his Majesty's islands, or from the United States to any part of the world except the United States, reasonable sea stores excepted. Provided also, that it shall and may be lawful, during the same period, for British vessels to import from the said islands into the United States, and to export from the United States to the said islands, all articles whatever being of the growth, produce or manu∣facture of the said islands, or of the United States re∣spectively, which now may, by the laws of the said States, be so imported and exported. And that the car∣goes of the said British vessels shall be subject to no other or higher duties or charges, than shall be payable on the same articles if so imported or exported in American vessels.</P>
<P>It is agreed that this article and every matter and thing therein contained, shall continue to be in force during the continuance of the war in which his Majesty is now engaged; and also for two years from and after the day of the signature of the preliminary or other articles of peace, by which the same may be terminated.</P>
<P>And it is further agreed, that at the expiration of the said term, the two contracting parties will endeavour further to regulate their commerce in this respect accor∣ding
<PB N="18" REF="031411_0016_0FEC51136DEA6500"/>
to the situation in which his Majesty may then find himself with respect to the West-Indies, and with a view to such arrangements as may best conduce to the mutal advantage and extension of commerce.

And that the citizens of the said United States, may freely carry on a trade between the said territories and the said United States in all articles of which the impor∣tation or exportation respectively, to or from the said territories, shall not be entirely prohibited. Provided only, that it shall not be lawful for them in any time of war between the British government and any other power or state whatever, to export from the said ter∣ritories, without the special permission of the British government there, any military stores, or naval stores, or rice.

And they shall pay no other or higher duties or charges, on the importation or exportation of the cargoes of the said vessels, than shall be payable on the same articles when imported or exported in British ves∣sels. But it is expressly agreed, that the vessels of the United States shall not carry any of the articles exported by them from the said British territories, to any port or place except to some port or place in America, where
<PB N="19" REF="031411_0017_0FEC511D82DCA2B0"/>
the same shall be unladen and such regulations shall be adopted by both parties, as shall from time to time be found necessary to enforce the due and faithful obser∣vance of this stipulation. It is also understood that the permission granted by this article, is not to extend to al∣low the vessels of the United States to carry on any part of the coasting trade of the said British territories; but vessels going with their original cargoes, or part thereof, from one port of discharge to another, are not to be con∣sidered as carrying on the coasting trade. Neither is this article to be construed to allow the citizens of the said States to settle or reside within the said territories, or to go into the interior parts thereof, without the per∣mission of the British government established there; and if any transgression should be attempted against the re∣gulations of the British government in this respect, the observance of the same shall and may be enforced against the citizens of America in the same manner as against British subjects or others transgressing the same rule. And the citizens of the United States whenever they ar∣rive in any port or harbour in the said territories, or if they should be permitted in manner aforesaid, to go to any other place therein, shall always be subject to the laws, government and jurisdiction of what nature estab∣lished in such harbour, port or place, according as the same may be. The citizens of the United States, may also touch for refreshment at the island of St. Helena, but subject in all respects to such regulations as the British government may from time to time establish there.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE XV.</HEAD>
<P>It is agreed that no other or higher duties shall be paid by the ships or merchandize of the one party in the ports of the other, than such as are paid by the like vessels or merchandize of all other nations. Nor shall any other or higher duty be imposed in one country on the importation of any articles the growth, produce or manufacture of the other, than are or shall be payable on the importation of the like articles being of the growth, produce, or manufacture of any other foreign country. Nor shall any prohibition be imposed on the exportation or importation of any articles to or from the territories of the two parties respectively, which shall not equally extend to all other nations.</P>
<P>But the British government reserves to itself the right of imposing on American vessels entering into the Bri∣tish ports in Europe, a tonnage duty equal to that which shall be payable by British vessels in the ports of Ame∣rica: And also such duty as may be adequate to coun∣tervail the difference of duty now payable on the impor∣tation of European and Asiatic goods, when imported into the United States in British or in American vessels.</P>
<P>The two parties agree to treat for the more exact equalization of the duties on the respective navigation of their subjects and people, in such manner as may be most beneficial to the two countries. The arrangements for this purpose shall be made at the same time, with those mentioned at the conclusion of the twelfth article of this treaty, and are to be considered as a part thereof.
<PB N="21" REF="031411_0019_0FEC512BB697F3C0"/>
In the interval it is agreed, that the United States will not impose any new or additional tonnage duties on British vessels, nor increase the now subsisting difference between the duties payable on the importation of any articles in British or in American vessels.</P>

<P>It shall be free for the two contracting parties, re∣spectively to appoint consuls for the protection of trade, to reside in the dominions and territories aforesaid; and the said consuls shall enjoy those liberties and rights which belong to them by reason of their function. But before any consul shall act as such, he shall be in the usual forms approved and admitted by the party to whom he is sent; and it is hereby declared to be law∣ful and proper, that in case of illegal or improper con∣duct towards the laws or government, a consul may either be punished according to law, if the laws will reach the case, or be dismissed, or even sent back, the offended government assigning to the other their reasons for the same.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE XVII.</HEAD>
<P>It is agreed, that in all cases where vessels shall be captured or detained on just suspicion of having on board enemy's property, or of carrying to the enemy any of the articles which are contraband of war; the said vessel shall be brought to the nearest or most con∣venient port; and if any property of an enemy should be found on board such vessel, that part only which be∣longs to the enemy shall be made prize, and the vessel shall be at liberty to proceed with the remainder with∣out any impediment. And it is agreed, that all proper measures shall be taken to prevent delay, in deciding the cases of ships or cargoes so brought in for adjudica∣tion; and in the payment or recovery of any indemni∣fication,

<P>And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the precise cases in which alone provisions and other articles not generally contraband may be regarded as such, renders it expedient to provide against the inconvenienies and misunderstandings which might thence arise: It is fur∣ther agreed, that whenever any such articles so becom∣ing contraband according to the existing laws of Na∣tions, shall for that reason be seized, the same shall not be confiscated, but the owners thereof shall be speedily and completely indemnified; and the captors, or in their default the government under whose authority they act, shall pay to the masters or owners of such vessels the full value of all such articles, with a reasonable mercantile profit thereon, together with the freight, and also the demurrage incident to such detention.</P>
<P>And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail for a port or place belonging to an enemy, without knowing that the same is either besieged, blockaded or invested; it is agreed, that every vessel so circumstanced
<PB N="23" REF="031411_0021_0FEC513BC11FC7E0"/>

<P>For this cause all commanders of privateers, before they receive their commissions, shall hereafter be obliged to give before a competent judge, sufficient security by at least two responsible sureties, who have no interest in the said privateer, each of whom, together with the said commander, shall be jointly and severally bound in the sum of fifteen hundred pounds sterling, or if such ships be provided with above one hundred and fifty seamen or soldiers, in the sum of three thousand pounds sterling, to satisfy all damages and injuries, which the said priva∣teer, or her officers or men, or any of them may do or commit during their cruise, contrary to the tenor of this treaty, or to the laws and instructions for regulating their conduct; and further that in all cases of aggressions the said commissions shall be revoked and annulled.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM honored with yours of August 30th. Mine of the 7th of that month assured you that measures were taken for excluding from all further asylum in our ports, vessels armed in them to cruize on nations with which we are at peace, and for the restoration of the prizes the Lovely Lass, Prince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin; and that should the measures for res∣titution fail in their effect, the President considered it as incumbent on the United States to make compensation for the vessels.</P>
<P>We are bound by our treaties with three of the bel∣ligerent nations, by all the means in our power to pro∣tect and defend their vessels and effects in our ports, or waters, or on the seas near our shores, and to recover and restore the same to the right owners when taken from them. If all the means in our power are used, and fail in their effect, we are not bound by our treaties with those nations to make compensation.</P>
<P>Though we have no similar treaty with Great-Britain, it was the opinion of the President, that we should use towards that nation the same rule, which under this article, was to govern us with the other nations; and even to extend it to captures made on the high seas, and brought into our ports: if done by vessels which had been armed within them.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="031411_0029_0FEC5158293F0178"/>Having, for particular reasons, forbore to use all the means in our power for the restitution of the three ves∣sels mentioned in my letter of August 7th, the President thought it incumbent on the United States to make com∣pensation for them: And though nothing was said in that letter of other vessels taken under like circum∣stancces, and brought in after the 5th of June, and be∣fore the date of that letter, yet when the same forbear∣ance had taken place, it was and is his opinion, that compensation would be equally due.</P>
<P>As to prizes made under the same circumstances, and brought in after the date of that letter, the President de∣termined, that all the means in our power should be used for their restitution. If these fail, as we should not be bound by our treaties to make compensation to the other powers in the analogous case, he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done to Great-Britain. But still if any cases shall arise subsequent to that date, the circumstances of which shall place them on similar ground with those before it, the President would think compensation equally incumbent on the United States.</P>
<P>Instructions are given to the governors of the differ∣ent states, to use all the means in their power for restor∣ing prizes of this last description found within their ports. Though they will of course take measures to be informed of them, and the general government has gi∣ven them the aid of the custom-house officers for this purpose, yet you will be sensible of the importance of multiplying the channels of their information as far as shall depend on yourself, or any person under your di∣rection, in order that the governors may use the means in their power for making restitution.</P>
<P>Without knowledge of the capture they cannot re∣store it. It will always be best to give the notice to them directly; but any information which you shall be plea∣sed to send to me also at any time shall be forwarded to them as quickly as distance will permit.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="031411_0030_0FEC5159D070ADE0"/>Hence you will perceive Sir, that the President con∣templates restitution or compensation in the case before the 7th August; and after that date, restitution if it can be effected by any means in our power. And that it will be important that you should substantiate the fact, that such prizes are in our ports or waters.</P>
<P>Your list of privateers illicitly armed in our ports is, I believe, correct.</P>
<P>With respect to losses by detention, waste, spoliation sustained by vessels taken as before mentioned, between the dates of June 5th and August 7th, it is proposed as a provisional measure, that the collector of the customs of the district, and the British consul, or any other person you please, shall appoint persons to establish the value of the vessel and cargo, at the time of her capture and of her arrival in the port into which she is brought, accord∣ing to their value in that port. If this shall be agreeable to you, and you will be pleased to signify it to me, with the names of the prizes understood to be of this des∣cription, instructions will be given accordingly, to the collector of the customs where the respective vessels are.</P>
