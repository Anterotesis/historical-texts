<HEAD>SOME MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF <HI>JOHN ROBERTS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I HAVE had it on my mind, for some years past, to commit to writing some memo∣rable passages, the chief of which were tansacted in my time, together with some short account of our family.</P>
<P>My grandfather's name was JOHN ROBERTS, <HI>alias</HI> HAYWARD. He liv'd at a vilage call'd <HI>Sid∣dington,</HI> within a mile of <HI>Cirencester,</HI> in <HI>Gloucester∣shire.</HI> I have heard he lived reputably on a little estate of his own, which he occupied. He mar∣ried MARY SOLLISS, sister to ANDREW SOLLISS. <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who was in the commission of the peace, and sustain'd great spoil in the time of the civil war between king CHARLES I. and the parliament. I have heard a colonel and his men and horses quar∣tered themselves upon him a considerable time to∣gether, turning their horses to the corn and hay mows.</P>
<P>My father and his next Neighbour went into the army under <HI>Oliver Cromwel,</HI> and continued till they 
<PB N="4" REF="007113_0003_102AFEBBCF6F33D0"/>
heard <HI>Cirencester</HI> was taken by the king's party; when they thought proper to return home, to see how it fared with their parents and relations.</P>
<P>As they were passing by <HI>Cirencester,</HI> they were discovered and pursu'd by two soldiers of the king's party (then in possession of the town.) See∣ing themselves pursued, they quitted their horses, and took to their heels: but by reason of their accoutrements could make little speed. They came up with my father first; and tho' he begged for quarter, none would they give him; but laid on him with their swords, cutting and slashing his hands and arms, which he held up to save his head; as the marks upon them did long after testify. At length it pleased the Almighty to put it into his mind to fall down on his face; which he did. Hereupon the soldiers being on horseback, cry'd to each other, <HI>alight, and cut his throat!</HI> But nei∣ther of them did; yet continued to strike and prick him about the jaws, 'till they thought him dead. Then they left him, and pursued his neighbour, whom they presently overtook and kill'd. Soon after they had left my father, it was said in his heart, <HI>Rife, and flee for thy life</HI>; which call he obey'd; and starting upon his feet, his enemies espy'd him in motion, and pursued him again. He ran down a steep hill, and through a river, which ran at the bottom of it; though with exceeding difficulty, his boots filling with water, and his wounds bleeding very much. They followed him to the top of the hill; but, seeing he had got over, they pursued him no fur∣ther. He was at a loss which way to take in this wounded and disconsolate condition, being sur∣rounded with enemies on every hand. At length he determined to go to his unkle <HI>Solliss's</HI>; from whence he sent a servant to a widow at <HI>Cirencester</HI> 
<PB N="5" REF="007113_0004_102AFEBE713EB850"/>
(at whose house the chief officers lay) with whom he was acquainted, desiring her to come to him; which she readily did, and offered him all the service in her power. He desired her, as the principal officers lay at her house, to use her in∣terest with them to give command that none of the soldiers might offer him any abuse. Which she effected; and in good will to her they like∣wise sent their ablest surgeon to him. He was a man of great skill, but of a four disposition; for he told my father, <HI>if he had met him in the field, he would have kill'd him himself; but now</HI> (said he) <HI>I'll cure you</HI>; which he did. When my father found himself able, he went to his father's house, and found him very ill in bed. They greeted each other with many tears, and a great inter∣mixture of joy and sorrow. After some time my father perceiv'd him to tremble to such a degree, that the bed shook under him Upon which my father asked him how it was with him? He repli∣ed, <Q>I am well: I feel no pain. 'Tis the mighty power of God that shakes me.</Q> After lying still some time, he broke out in a sweet melody of spirit, saying, <Q>In the Lord only have I righte∣ousness and strength! In God have I salvation!</Q> I don't remember to have heard he said any thing more before his departure.</P>
<P>The civil war continuing, my father found he could not be safe at home; and therefore he went again, and continued till near the conclusion of that dreadful eruption; when he return'd again to his sorrowful family at <HI>Siddington.</HI> After some time he took to wife <HI>Lydia Tindal,</HI> daughter of <HI>Thomas Tindal</HI> of <HI>Slincomb,</HI> near <HI>Dursley</HI>; a religi∣ous family, and one of those under the denomina∣tion of <HI>Puritans. Matthew Hale</HI> (afterwards lord chief justice of <HI>England</HI>) was her kinsman, and 
<PB N="6" REF="007113_0005_102AFEC1D9DF7578"/>
drew her marriage-settlement. It pleased God to give them six children, <HI>viz. John, Joseph, Lydia, Thomas, Nathaniel,</HI> and <HI>Daniel. Joseph</HI> and <HI>Lydia</HI> died young; <HI>Thomas</HI> was kill'd at the age of four∣teen, by a kick from a mare; the rest lived to man's estate.</P>
<P>In the year 1665, it pleased the Lord to send two women friends out of the <HI>North</HI> to <HI>Cirencester,</HI> who enquiring after such as feared God, were di∣rected to my father, as the likeliest person to en∣tertain them. They came to his house, and desir∣ed a meeting. He granted it, and invited several of his acquaintance to sit with them. After some time of silence, the friends spake a few words, which had a good effect. After the meeting, my father endeavor'd to engage them in discourse: but they said little, only recommended him to <HI>Richard Farnsworth,</HI> then a prisoner for the testi∣mony of truth in <HI>Banbury</HI> jail, to whom they were going. Upon this recommendation my father went shortly after to the prison, in order to con∣verse with <HI>Richard</HI>; where he met with the two women who had been at his house. The turnkey was denying them entrance, and telling them he had an order not to let any of those <HI>giddy-headed people</HI> in; and therefore if they did <HI>go in,</HI> he would <HI>keep</HI> them there. But upon my father's desire they were admitted in along with him, and conducted through several rooms to a dungeon, where <HI>Richard Farnsworth</HI> was preach∣ing through a grate to the people in the street: but soon after they came in, he desisted; and, after a little time of silence, turning to them, he spake to this purpose: <Q>That <HI>Zacheus,</HI> being a man of low stature, and having a mind to see Christ, ran before, and climb'd up into a syca∣more tree: and our Saviour, knowing his good 
<PB N="7" REF="007113_0006_102AFEC374534768"/>
desires, call'd to him, <HI>Zacheus, come down! This day is salvation come to thy house.</HI> Thus, <HI>Zacheus</HI> was like some in our day, who are climbing up into the tree of knowledge, think∣ing to find Christ there. But the word now is, <HI>Zacheus come down, come down; for that which is to be known of</HI> God, <HI>is manifested</HI> within.</Q> This, with more to the same purpose, was spoken in such <HI>Authority,</HI> that, when my father came home, he told my mother he had seen <HI>Richard Farnsworth,</HI> who had spoke to his condition as if he had known him from his youth. From this time he pati∣ently bore the cross; afterwards, when it pleased God to communicate to him a portion of the knowledge of his blessed <HI>Truth,</HI> a necessity was laid upon him one first-day morning to go to the public worship house in <HI>Cirencester</HI> in the time of worship, not knowing what might be re∣quired of him there. He went; and, standing with his hat on, the priest was silent for some time: but being asked why he did not go on? he answer'd, he <HI>could not, while that man stood with his hat on.</HI> Upon this some took him by the arm, and led him into the street, staying at the door to keep him out: but after waiting a little in stilness, he found himself clear, and passed a∣way. As he pass'd the market-place, the tie of his shoe slacken'd; and while he stooped down to fasten it, a man came behind him, and struck him on the back a hard blow with a stone, saying, <HI>There, take that for</HI> Jesus Christ's <HI>sake.</HI> He answer'd, <HI>so I do</HI>; not looking back to see who is was, but quietly going his way. A few days af∣ter a man came and asked him forgiveness; telling him he was the unhappy man that gave him the blow on his back, and he could have no rest since he had done it.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007113_0007_102AFEC5125A2690"/>
Not long after, three <HI>Friends</HI> came that way, who found the like concern, <HI>viz. Robert Silvester, Phi∣lip Grey,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Onyon.</HI> These standing in the steeple-house with their hats on, tho' they said nothing, the priest was silent: And being asked if he was not well? he answered, he <HI>could not go forward whilst those dumb dogs stood there.</HI> Wherefore the People dragg'd them out: and the priest af∣terwards informing a justice that they had inter∣rupted him in divine service, they were bound over to the quarter-sessions. My father, at their desire, accompany'd them to the sessions: and when they were called, and the priest had accused them, the bench, in a rage, without asking them any questions, ordered their mittimus's to be made. This unjust and illegal proceeding kindled my father's zeal, insomuch that he stepping forward, called to the justices, saying, <HI>Are not those who sit on the bench sworn to do justice? Is there not a man among you that will do the thing that is right?</HI> Whereupon <HI>John Stephens,</HI> of <HI>Lipeat</HI> (then chair∣man) cry'd out, <HI>Who are you, sirrah? What is your name?</HI> My father telling him his name, he said, <HI>I am glad I have you here: I have heard of you: you deserve a stone doublet: there's many an honester man than you hang'd. It may be so,</HI> answered my father: but what do'st thou think becomes of those who hang honest men? <HI>The Justice reply'd,</HI> I'll send you to prison; and if any insurrection or tumult be in the land, I'll come and cut your throat first with my own sword; for I fear to sleep in my bed, lest such fanatics should come and cut my throat: and, snatching up a ball of wax, he violently throw'd it at my father; who avoided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e blow by stepping aside. Their mitti∣mus's were then made, and they were all sent to prison.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="007113_0008_102AFEC7B4B5B6A0"/>
The same evening my uncle <HI>Solliss,</HI> who was one of the justices on the bench, came to the pri∣son, and, calling for my father, asked him if he was willing to have his liberty to go home to his wife and family? <HI>Upon what terms uncle?</HI> said my father.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Justice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon such terms, that the jailor open the door, and let you out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! without entering into any recognizance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Justice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I accept of my liberty. But admire, uncle, how thou and several others could sit upon the bench as with your thumbs in your mouths, when you should speak a word in behalf of the innocent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Justice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must learn to live under a law, cousin. And if you will accept of your liberty till next sessions, you may have it: if not, stay where you are.</P>
</SP>
<P>So they parted; and on the morrow my father went home, having also the jailor's leave.</P>
<P>In the night a concern came upon him, with such weight, that it made him tremble till the bed shook under him. My mother asking the reason of it, he answered: <HI>The Lord requires hard things of me: if it would please him, I had rather lay down my life than obey him in what he requires at my hands.</HI> To which my mother reply'd: <Q>If thou art fully persuaded the Lord requires it of thee, I would not have thee disobey him; for he will require nothing of us but what he will enable us to go through: Therefore we have good cause to trust in him.</Q> <HI>On which he said,</HI> I must go to this <HI>John Stephens,</HI> who is my great enemy, and sent me to prison, where he said he would secure me; and as my uncle <HI>Solliss</HI> in kindness has 
<PB N="10" REF="007113_0009_102AFECA4528E470"/>
given me leave to come home, I can expect no favor from him, if I now go and run myself into the mouth of my adversary. But I must go whatever I suffer. He arose, and prepared for his journey; but durst eat or drink nothing. When he mounted his horse, the command of the Lord was unto him, <HI>Remember</HI> Lot'<HI>s wife: look not back.</HI> So on he rode very chearfully 8 or 9 miles, till he came within sight of the justice's house, and then he let in the reasoner, who rea∣soned him out of all his courage, presenting to his mind, that his uncle <HI>Solliss</HI> and his neighbors would say he had no regard for his wife and family, thus to push himself into the hands of his greatest enemy. This brought such a cloud over his mind, that he alighted off his horse, and sat down upon the ground, to spread his cause before the Lord. After he had waited sometime in si∣lence, the Lord appeared, and dishpated the cloud, and his word was to him, <HI>Go, and I will go with thee, and will give thee a threshing instrument, and thou shalt thresh the mountains</HI> Now he was ex∣ceedingly overcome with the love of God: and I have often heard him say, he was filled like a vessel that wanted vent, and said in his heart, <HI>Thy presence is enough,</HI> proceeding to the house with great satisfaction. It being pretty early in the morning, and seeing the stable door open, he went to the groom, and desired him to put up his horse. While this was doing, the justice's son and his clerk came up, the latter roughly said, <Q>I thought you had been in <HI>Gloucester</HI> castle.</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how came you out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>When thou hast authority to demand it, I can give thee an answer. But my 
<PB N="11" REF="007113_0010_102AFECBCC9E9740"/>
business is with thy master, if I may speak with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may, if you'll promise to be civil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>If thou seest me uncivil, I desire thee to tell me of it.</P>
</SP>
<P>They went in; and my father following them, they bid him take a turn in the hall, and they would acquaint the justice of his being there. He was soon call'd in; and my father no sooner saw him, but he believed the Lord had been at work upon him: for, as he had behaved to him with the fierceness of a lion before, he now ap∣peared like a lamb, meeting him with a pleasant countenance, and, taking him by the hand, said, <Q>Friend <HI>Haywood,</HI> how do you do?</Q> My father answered, <HI>pretty well</HI>; and then proceeded thus; <HI>I am come in the fear and dread of heaven, to warn thee to repent of thy wickedness with speed, lest the Lord cut the thread of thy life, and send thee to the pit that is bottomless. I am come to warn thee, in great love, whether thou wilt hear or forbear, and to preach the everlasting Gospel to thee.</HI> The justice reply'd, <Q>You are a welcome messenger to me; that is what I have long desired to hear.</Q> <HI>The everlast∣ing Gospel</HI> (returned my father) <HI>is the same that</HI> God <HI>sent his servant</HI> John <HI>to declare, when he saw an angel flying through the midst of beaven, saying with a loud voice,</HI> <Q><HI>Fear God, and give glory to his name, and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea, and the fountains of water,</HI></Q> The justice then caused my father to sit down by him on a couch; and said, <Q>I believe your message is of God, and I receive it as such. I am sorry I have done you wrong: and I will never wrong you more. I would pray you to forgive me, and to pray to God to forgive me.</Q> After 
<PB N="12" REF="007113_0011_102AFECD6009D3F8"/>
much more discourse, he offered my father the best entertainment his house afforded; but my father excused himself from eating or drinking with him at that time, expressing his kind accept∣ance of his love; and so in much love they parted.</P>
<P>The same day <HI>William Dewsberry</HI> had appointed a meeting at <HI>Tedbury</HI>; whether my mother went. But she was so concerned on account of my fa∣ther's exercise, that she could receive little benefit from the meeting. After the meeting was ended, <HI>William Dewsberry</HI> walk'd to and fro in a long passage, groaning in spirit; and by and by came up to my mother, and, tho' she was a stranger to him, he laid his hand upon her head, and said, <Q>Woman thy sorrow is great: I sorrow with thee.</Q> Then walking a little to and fro, as before, he came to her again, and said, <Q>Now the time is come, <HI>that those who marry, must be as tho' they married not, and those who have husbands, as tho' they had none</HI>; for the Lord calls for all to be offered up.</Q> By this she saw the Lord had given him a sense of her great burthen; for she had not discovered her exercise to any: And it gave her such ease in her mind, that she went home rejoicing in the Lord. She no sooner got home, but she found my father returned from <HI>Lypeat,</HI> where his message was received in such love, as was far from their expectation: the sense of which, brake them into tears, in consideration of the great goodness of God, in so eminently making way for, and helping them that day.</P>
<P>At the next sessions my father and the three <HI>friends</HI> appear'd in court; where, as soon as jus∣tice <HI>Stephens</HI> espy'd them, he call'd to my father, and said, <Q><HI>John,</HI> I accept of your appearance, and discharge you, and the court discharges you. 
<PB N="13" REF="007113_0012_102AFECEEF253AA8"/>
You may go about your business.</Q> But my father thinking his work not done, did not hasten out of court. Upon which the clerk demanded his fees. <HI>What! dost mean money?</HI> says my father. <Q>Yes: what do you think I mean?</Q> says the clerk. My father reply'd, <HI>I don't know that I ow any man here any thing but love, and must I now purchase my liberty with money? I dont accept it on such terms.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(to the chairman.)</STAGE> An't please your wor∣ship, <HI>John</HI> won't pay the fees of the court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't accept my liberty on such terms.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then he was ordered to prison with the three <HI>friends.</HI> But in the evening the clerk discharged them, and ever after carried himself very kindly to my father.</P>
<P>He was afterwards cast into prison at <HI>Cirencester,</HI> by <HI>George Bull,</HI> vicar of <HI>Upper Siddington,</HI> for tythes. Where was confined at the same time, upon the same account, <HI>Elizabeth Hewlings</HI> a wi∣dow, of <HI>Amney,</HI> near <HI>Cirencester.</HI> She was a good christian, and so good a midwife that her confine∣ment was a loss to that side of the country; inso∣much, that lady <HI>Dunch,</HI> of <HI>Down-Amney,</HI> thought it would be an act of charity to the neighborhood to purchase her likerty, by paying the priest's demand; which she did. She like wise came to <HI>Cirencester</HI> in a coach, and sent her footman <HI>Alex∣ander Cornwall,</HI> to the prison to bring <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to her. And while <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was making ready to go with the man, my father and he fell into a little discourse. He ask'd my father his name, and where his home was; which when my father had told him. <Q>What▪ said he, are you that <HI>John Haywood</HI> of <HI>Siddington,</HI> who keeps great conventicles at your house?</Q> My father 
<PB N="14" REF="007113_0013_102AFED2C2E3B730"/>
answer'd. <HI>The church of</HI> Christ <HI>often meets at my house. I suppose I am the man thou meanest.</HI> <Q>I have often (reply'd <HI>Cornwall</HI>) heard my lady speak of you; and I am sure she would gladly be acquainted with you:</Q> When he returned to his lady, he told her he had met with such a man in the prison as he believed she would not suffer to lie in prison for conscience-sake; informing her withal who he was. She immediately bid him go back and fetch him to her. Accordingly he came to the jail, and told my father his lady want∣ed to speak with him. My father answered; <HI>If any body would speak with me, they must come where I am; for I am a prisoner.</HI> <Q>Oh (said <HI>Cornwall</HI>) I'll get leave of the jailor for you to go.</Q> Which he did. And when they came before the lady, she put on a majestic air, to see how the <HI>Quaker</HI> would greet her. He went up towards her, and bluntly said, <HI>Woman, wouldst then speak with me?</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is your name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>My name is <HI>John Roberts,</HI> but I am commonly known by the name of <HI>John Hay∣wood</HI> in the place where I live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where do you live?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>At a vilage call'd <HI>Siddington,</HI> a∣bout a mile distant from this town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you the man that keeps con∣venticles at your house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>The church of Christ do often meet at my house. I presume I am the man that thou meanest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you lie in prison for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, for conscience-sake, I can't pay an hireling priest what he demands of me; therefore he, like the false prophets of 
<PB N="15" REF="007113_0014_102AFED44911EE10"/>
old, prepares war against me, because I can't put into his month.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>By what I have heard of you, I took you to be a wise man, and if you could not pay him yourself, you might let somebody else pay him for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be underhand deal∣ing, and I had rather pay him myself, than be such a hypocrite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then suppose some neighbor or friend should pay him for you, unknown to you, you would choose not to lie in prison when you might have your liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very well content where I am, till it shall please God to make way for my freedom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a mind to set you at liberty, that I may have some of your company, which I can∣not well have while you are in the prison.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then, speaking to her man, she bid him go to the priest's attorney, and tell him she would satis∣fy him, and then pay the jailor his fees, and get a horse for my father to go to <HI>Down-Amney</HI> with her.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>If thou art a charitable woman, as I take thee to be, there are abroad in the world many real objects of charity on whom to bestow thy bounty: but to feed such devourers as these, I don't think to be charity. They are like Pha∣roah's lean kine; they eat up the fat and the goodly, and look not a whit the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; I would have you get ready to go with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't know thou art like to have me when thou hast bought and paid for me: for if I may have my liberty, I shall think it my place to be at home with my wife and family.
<PB N="16" REF="007113_0015_102AFED612CDD7C0"/>
But, if thou desirest it, I intend to come and see thee at <HI>Down-Amney</HI> some other time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will suit me better. But set your time, and I'll lay aside all other business to have your company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it please God to give me life, health, and liberty, I intend to come on seven∣day next, the day thou callest saturday.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>

<P>According to his appointment, my father went; and found her very inquisitive about the things of God, and very attentive to the truths he delivered. She engaged him likewise a second time, and treat∣ed him with abundance of regard. A third time she bid her man <HI>Cornwall</HI> go to him, and desire him to appoint a day when he would pay her a∣nother visit: and then ordered him to go to priest <HI>Careless,</HI> of <HI>Cirencester,</HI> and desire him to come and take a dinner with her at the same time; and not let either of them know the other was to be there. On the day appointed my father went; and when he had got within sight of her house, he heard a horse behind him, and looking back, he saw the priest following him; which made him conclude the lady had projected to bring them together. When the priest came up to him, <Q>Well overtaken, <HI>John</HI> (said he) how far are you going this way?</Q> My father answered, <HI>I believe we are both going to the same place.</HI> <Q>What! (said <HI>Careless</HI>) are you going the great house?</Q> <HI>Yes,</HI> said my fathers. <Q>Come on then <HI>John,</HI></Q> said he. So then they went in together. And the lady being ill in bed, a servant went up and in∣formed her they were come. <Q>What! (said she) did they come together?</Q> <HI>Yes,</HI> answered the servant. <Q>I admire at that (said she) But do you 
<PB N="17" REF="007113_0016_102AFED86EDAEF20"/>
beckon <HI>John</HI> out, and bring him to me first up the back stairs.</Q> When my father came up, she told him she had been very ill in a fit of the stone, and said, <Q>I have heard you have done good in many distempers.</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess I have; but to this of the stone I am a stranger. Indeed I once knew a man, who lived at ease, and fared delicately, as thou may'st do, and whilst he continued in that practice he was much afflicted with that distemper. But it pleased the Lord to visit him with the know∣ledge of his blessed truth, which brought him to a more regular and temperate life, and this pre∣served him more free from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I know what you aim at. You want to have me a <HI>Quaker.</HI> And I confess, if I could be such an one as you are, I would be a <HI>Quaker</HI> to-morrow.— But I understand Mr <HI>Care∣less</HI> is below, and tho' you are men of different perswasions, I account you both wise and godly men, and some moderate discourse of the things of God between you, I believe would do me good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>If he ask me any questions, as the Lord shall enable me, I shall endeavor to give him an answer.</P>
</SP>
<P>She then had the parson up: and after a com∣pliment or two, she said, I made bold to send for you to take an ordinary dinner with me, tho' I am disappointed of your company by my illness. But <HI>John Haywood</HI> and you being persons of different persuasions (tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> believe both good christians) if you would soberly ask and answer each other a few questions, it would divert me; so that I should be less sensible of the pains I lie under.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray Mr. <HI>Careless,</HI> ask <HI>John</HI> some ques∣tions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Priest.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will not edify your ladyship; for I have discoursed <HI>John,</HI> and several others of his perswasion, divers times, and I have read their books, and all to no purpose; for they sprang from the <HI>Papists,</HI> and hold the same doctrin the <HI>Papists</HI> do. Let <HI>John</HI> deny it if he can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I find thou art setting us out in very black characters with design to affright me; but therein thou wilt be mistaken. I advise thee to say no worse of us than thou canst make out, and then make us as black as thou canst. And if thou canst prove me a <HI>Papist</HI> in one thing, with the help of God I'll prove thee like them in ten. And this woman who lies here in bed, shall be judge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Priest.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Quakers</HI> hold that damnable doc∣trine, and dangerous tenet, of perfection in this life; and so do the <HI>Papists.</HI></P>
<P>If you go about to deny it <HI>John,</HI> I can prove you hold it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt thou art now going a∣bout to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the <HI>Papists</HI> behind their backs, as thou hast heretofore done by us. For, by what I have learnt of their principles, they do not be∣lieve a state of freedom from sin and acceptance with God possible on this side the grave; and therefore they have imagined to themselves a place of purgation after death. But whether they believe such a state attainable or no, I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Priest.</SPEAKER>
<P>An't please your ladyship, <HI>John</HI> has confessed enough out of his own mouth; for that is a damnable doctrine, and dangerous tenet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would ask thee one question: dost thou own a purgatory?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="007113_0018_102AFEDD907DB1E8"/>
<SPEAKER>Priest.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the <HI>Papists,</HI> in this case, are wiser than thee. They own the saying of Christ, who told the unbelieving <HI>Jews, If ye die in your sins, whither I go ye cannot come.</HI> But, by thy discourse, thou and thy followers must needs go headlong to destruction; since thou neither ownest a place of purgation after death, nor such a prepa∣ration for heaven to be possible in this life, as is absolutely necessary. The Scripture thou know∣est tells us, <HI>Where death leaves us, judgment will find us. If a tree falls towards the north or south, there it shall lie.</HI></P>
<P>And since <HI>no unclean thing can en∣ter the kingdom of Heaven,</HI> pray tell this poor woman, whom thou hast been preaching to for thy belly, whether ever, or never, she must ex∣pect to be freed from her sins, and made sit for the kingdom of heaven; or whether the blind must lead the blind till both fall into the ditch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Priest.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, <HI>John,</HI> you mistake me: I believe that God Almighty is able of his great mercy to forgive persons their sins, and fit them for hea∣ven, a little before they depart this life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe the same. But, if thou wilt limit the Holy One of <HI>Israel,</HI> how long wilt thou give the Lord leave to fit a person for his glorious kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Priest.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be an hour or two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>My faith is a day or two, as well as an hour or two.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Priest.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe so too.</P>

<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> week or two.</P>
</SP>
<P>And my father carried it to a month or two; and so gra∣dually till he brought it to seven years, the priest confessing he believed the same. On which my father thus proceeded: <Q>How could'st thou ac∣cuse 
<PB N="20" REF="007113_0019_102AFEDF5E8F2E60"/>
me of popery, in holding this doctrine, which thou thy self hast confess'd too? If I am like a <HI>Papist,</HI> thou art, by thy own confession, as like a <HI>Papist</HI> as I am. And if it be a damna∣ble doctrine and dangerous tenet in the <HI>Quakers,</HI> is it not the same in thy self? Thou told'st me I mistook thee; but hast not thou mistaken thy self in condemning thine own acknowledged opinion when utter'd by me? But notwithstand∣ing thou hast fail'd in making me out to be a <HI>Papist</HI> in this particular, can'st thou do it in any thing else?</Q> Upon this the priest being mute, my father thus proceeded: <Q>Well! tho' thou hast fall'd in proving me like them, it need not hin∣der me from shewing thee to be so in many things. For instance, you build houses and consecrate them, calling them churches; as do the <HI>Papists.</HI> You hang bells in 'em, and con∣secrate 'em, calling them by the names of faints; so do they. The pope and the priests of the <HI>Roman</HI> church wear surplices, gowns, cas∣socks, &amp;c. calling them their ornaments; here thou hast the like; and do'st thou not stile them thy ornaments? You consecrate the ground where you interr your dead, calling it holy ground; so do they. In short, thou art like a <HI>Papist</HI> in so many things, he need be a wise man to distinguish betwixt them and thee.</Q></P>
<P>At this the priest appear'd uneasy, and said to the lady, <Q>Madam, I must beg your excuse; for there's to be a lecture this afternoon, and I must be there.</Q> She prest him to stay to dinner, but he earnesty desired to be excused. So a slice or two being cut off of the spit, he eat, and took his leave.</P>
<P>The lady then said to my father, had she not seen it, she could not have believed Mr. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>less</HI> 
<PB N="21" REF="007113_0020_102AFEE29084BE98"/>
could have been so soil'd in discourse by any man: for, said she, I accoun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> him as sound and ortho∣dox a divine as any wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but now I must tell you, I am so far of your opinion, that if you'll let me know when you have a meeting at your house, and somebody to preach (not a silent meeting) I'll come and hear 'em my self. My father an∣swered, he expected she would be as good as her word. Not long after came two friends to my father's house; and tho' the weather was very severe, he found he could not be easy without acquainting her with it. So he went to her house, but she seem'd a little surprized, saying, <Q>What's your will now, <HI>John</HI>?</Q> He imformed her of the two friends, and their intention of having a meeting at his house. <Q>How can you expect (said she) I should go out such weather as this? You know I seldom stir out of my chamber, and to go so far may endanger my health.</Q> My father returned, <Q>I would not have thee make excuses, as some of old did, and were not found worthy. Thou knowest time is none of ours, and we know not whe∣ther we may have the like opportunity again. The snow need not much incommode thee: thou may'st be quickly in thy coach, and, put∣ting up the glasses, may be pretty warm; and when thou comest to my house, I know my wife will do her best for thee.</Q> So she or∣dered her coach and six to be got ready (for the distance was seven miles) saying, <Q><HI>John's</HI> like death, he'll not be deny'd,</Q> My father came along with her; and during the time of silence in the meeting, she appear'd something restless; but was very attentive whilst either of the friends were speaking. She was very well pleased after the meeting, and sat at table with the friends. 
<PB N="22" REF="007113_0021_102AFEE49C5EC1A0"/>
While the rest sat silent, she would be frequent∣ly whispering to my mother, till one of them spake a few words before meat. She was asham'd, and told my mother when she was among the great, she was accounted a wise woman; but now (said she) I am among you <HI>Luakers,</HI> I am a very fool. Presently after dinner she return'd home, and came several times to the meeting afterward; and I am fully persuaded she was convinced of the truth; but going up to <HI>London,</HI> she was there taken ill, and died.</P>
<P>Her man, <HI>Alexander Cornwall,</HI> was convinced of the truth, and was afterwards a prisoner with my father in <HI>Gloucester</HI> castle; where the jailor was very cruel to them, sometimes putting them into the common jail among felons, and other times he would hire a tinker (who lay for his sees) to trouble them in the night by playing on his hautboy. One time in particular my father being concerned to speak to him in the dread and power of God, it struck him to such a degree, that he dropt the instrument out of his hand, and would never take it into hand upon that occasion any more. When the jailor ask'd him why he dis∣continued it, he answered, <Q>They are the ser∣vants of the living God, and I'll never play more to disturb them, if you hang me up at the door for it.</Q> <Q>What! (said the jailor) are you bewitch'd too? I'll turn you out of the castle.</Q> Which he did; and the friends who were there prisoners rais'd him some money, cloath'd him, and away he went.</P>
<P>Some time after my father had three conferen∣ces with — <HI>Nicholson,</HI> bishop of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> in∣troduced in the following manner. An apparitor came to cite my father to appear at the bishop's court: but he told my father he could not en∣courage 
<PB N="23" REF="007113_0022_102AFEE649713898"/>
him to come, lest they should ensnare him, and send him to prison. At the same time they cited a servant of my father's, named <HI>John Overall.</HI> My father went at the time appointed, without his servant: and when his name was call'd over, he answered to it. The discourse that occurr'd was in substance as follows:—</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's your name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been called by my name, and answered to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire to hear it again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>My name is <HI>John Roberts.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; you were born <HI>Roberts</HI>; but you were not born <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>Pray who gave you that name?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou hast asked me a very hard question, my name being given me before I was capable of remembring who gave it me. But I believe it was my parents, they being the only persons who had a right to give me my name. That name they always call'd me by, and to that name I always answered; and I believe none need call it in question now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; but how many children have you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>It hath pleased God to give me six children; three of whom he was pleased to take from me; the other three are still living.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how many of them have been bishop'd?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>None that I know of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>What reason can you give for that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very good one, I think: most of my children were born in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s days, when bishops were out of fashion. (<HI>At this the court fell a laughing.</HI>)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="24" REF="007113_0023_102AFEE88BEFB1D0"/>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how many of them have been baptized?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>What dost thou mean by that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! don't you own baptism?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; but perhaps we may dif∣fer in that point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Baptism do you own? That of the Spirit I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. What other baptism should I own?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you own but one baptism?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>If one be enough, what needs any more? The apostle said, <HI>One Lord, one faith, and baptism.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>What say you of the baptism of water?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I say there was a man sent from God, whose name was <HI>John,</HI> who had a real commishon for it; and he was the only man that I read of who was impower'd for that work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if I make it appear to you, that some of Christ's disciples themselves bap∣tized with water, after Chrift's Ascension?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose that's no very difficult task: but what is that to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it nothing to you, what Christ's dis∣ciples themselves did?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in every thing; for <HI>Paul,</HI> that eminent apostle, who I suppose thou wilt grant had as extensive a commissionas any of the rest of the apostles; nay, he says himself, he was not a whit be hind the chiefest of them, and yet he honestly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>esses he had no commission to baptize with w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er; and further says, <HI>I thank God I baptized none but</HI> such and such; for (says he) <HI>I was not sent to baptize (i. e.</HI> with water) <HI>but to preach the gospel.</HI></P>
<P>And if he was not sent, I would soberly ask, who required it at his hands? Perhaps he 
<PB N="25" REF="007113_0024_102AFEEAE2BB0590"/>
might have as little thanks for his labor as thou mayst have for thine; and I would willingly know who sent thee to baptize?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is not our present business. You are here return'd for not coming to church. What say you to that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire to see mine accusers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the minister and church-wardens. Do you deny it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes I do: for it is always my principle and practice to go to church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you go to church?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and sometimes the church comes to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>The church comes to you? I don't understand you friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so: 'tis often for want of a good understanding that the innocent are made to suffer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apparitor.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord, he keeps meetings at his house, and he calls that a church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I no more believe my house to be a <HI>church,</HI> than I believe what you call so to be one. I call the people of God the church of God, wheresoever they are met to worship him in spirit and in truth. And when I say the church comes to me, I mean the assembly of such worshippers, who frequently meet at my house. I do not call that a church which you do, which is made of wood and stone, that is but the workmanship of mens hands: whereas the true church consists of living stones, and is built up by Christ a spiritual house to God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>We call it a church figuratively, meaning the place where the church meets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear you call it a church hy∣pocritically and deceitfully, with design to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 
<PB N="26" REF="007113_0025_102AFEED91EDB8C0"/>
the people into a veneration for the place, which is not due to it, as though your consecrations had made that house holier than others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you call that which we call a church?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may properly enough be call'd a mass-house, it being formerly built for that purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apparitor.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Haywood,</HI> it is expected you should shew more respect than you do in this place in keeping on your hat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who expects it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apparitor.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lord bishop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I expect better things from him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; keep on your hat: I don't expect it from you. A little after, the bishop said: Well friend, this is not a convenient time for you and I to dispute; but I may take you to my chamber and convince you of your errors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should take it kindly of thee, or any man else, to convince me of any errors that I hold; and would hold them no longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call some others.—Then my father's man was call'd; who not appearing, the appari∣tor said, Mr. <HI>Haywood,</HI> is <HI>John Overall</HI> here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the reason he is not here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think there are very good rea∣sons for his absence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are they? mayn't I know?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the first place, he is an old man, and not of ability to undertake such a jour∣ney, except it was upon a very good account. In the second place, he is my servant; and I can't spare him out of my business in my absence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why does he not go to church the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="27" REF="007113_0026_102AFEEF2E97A490"/>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>He does go to church with me. (at this the court fell a laughing.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call somebody else.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then a <HI>Baptist</HI> preacher was call'd, who see∣ing the bishop's civility to my father, in suffering him to keep on his hat, thought to take the same liberty. At whom the bishop put on a stern countenance, and said, "Don't you know this is the king's court, and that I sit here to represent his majesty's person? And do you come here in an uncivil and irreverent manner, in contempt of his majesty and his court, with your hat on? I con∣fess there are some men in the world who make a conscience of putting off their hats, to whom we ought to have some regard. But for you, who can put it off to every mechanic you meet, to come here, in contempt of authority, with it on, I'll assure you, friend, you shall speed never the better for it"—I heard my father say, these words came so honestly from the bishop, that it did him good to hear him.—The <HI>Baptist</HI> then taking off his hat, said, <Q>An't please you, my lord, I han't been well in my head.</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, You have got a cap on; nay you have two caps on. (He had a black one o∣ver a white one.) What is your reason for de∣nying your children that holy ordinance of bap∣tisin?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baptist.</SPEAKER>
<P>An't please you my lord, I am not well satisfied about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's the ground of your dissatis∣faction? did you ever see a book I publish'd, en∣titled, <HI>The order of baptism?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baptist.</SPEAKER>
<P>No my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought so.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then telling how and where he might get it, he gave him a space of time to peruse it; and told him if that would not 
<PB N="28" REF="007113_0027_102AFEF0B5711760"/>
satisfy him, to come to him, and he would give him full satisfaction.—Some time after the bishop sent his bailiff to take my father: but he was then gone to <HI>Bristol</HI> with <HI>George Fox.</HI> The officers came several times and searched the house for him, pretending they only wanted him for a small trespass, which would soon be made up, if they could see him. My mother answered she didn't believe any neighbor he had would trou∣ble him upon such an account; for if by chance any of his cattle trespass'd upon any, he would readily make 'em satisfaction, without further trouble. Which they very well knew. How∣ever, she always treated them civilly, and fre∣quently set meat and drink before 'em. My fa∣ther staying away longer than was expected, they imagin'd he absconded for fear of 'em; and therefore offer'd my mother, if she would give them twenty shillings, to let him come home for a month. But she told them she knew of no wrong he had done to any man, and therefore would give 'em no money; for that would im∣ply a consciousness of guilt "But (said she) if my enemy hunger, I can feed him; and if he thirst, I can give him drink." Upon this they flew into a rage, and said, they would have him if he were above ground; for none could pardon him but the king.—My father returning home thro' <HI>Tedbury,</HI> was there inform'd that the bailiffs had been about his house almost ever since he went from home. He therefore contrived to come home after day-light, when he came into his own grounds, the moon shining bright, he spy'd the shadow of a man, and ask'd, who's there? 'It is I,' says the man.</P>

<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who! Sam. Stubbs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sam. Stubbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, master.</P>

<PB N="29" REF="007113_0028_102AFEF23B7734A0"/>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hast thou any thing against me? (He was a bailiff.)</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S. Stubbs.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, master: I might; but I would not meddle: I have wrong'd you enough already: God forgive me. But those who now lie in wait for you are the <HI>Paytons,</HI> my lord bimop's bailiffs. I would not have you fall into their hands, for they are merciless rogues. I would have you, master, take my counsel: ever while you live please a knave, for an honest man won't hurt you.</P>
</SP>
<P>My father came home, and desired us not to let the bailiffs in upon him that night, that he might have an opportunity of taking counsel on his pillow. In the morning he told my mother what he had seen that night in a vision. "I thought (said he) I was walking a fine, pleasant green way; but it was narrow, and had a wall on each side of it. In my way lay something like a bear, but more dreadful. The sight of him put me to a stand. A man seeing me surpriz'd, came to me with a smiling countenance, and said, <HI>Why art thou afraid, friend? he is chain'd, and can't hurt thee.</HI> I tho't I made answer, <HI>The way is so narrow, I can't pass by but he may reach me.—Don't be afraid</HI> (says the man) <HI>he can't hurt thee.</HI> I saw he spake in great goodwill, and thought his face shone like the face of an angel. Upon which I took courage, and steping forward, laid my hand upon his head."—The construction be made of this to my mother was: <HI>Truth is a narrow way; and this bishop lies in my way: I must go to him, whatever I suffer.</HI> So he arose, and set forward, and call'd upon <HI>Amariah Dreweit,</HI> a friend of <HI>Gi∣rencester,</HI> to accompany him. When they came to the bishop's house at <HI>Cle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> near <HI>Glouceser</HI>) they found a butcher's wife of <HI>Girencester,</HI> who was come to intercede for her husband, who 
<PB N="30" REF="007113_0029_102AD751E3257F60"/>
was put into the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shop's court for killing meat on firstdays. Two young sparks of the bishop's attendance, were asking her if she knew <HI>John Haywood</HI>? She answered, 'Yes, very well.' "What is he for a man?" said they <HI>A very good man</HI> (said she) <HI>setting aside his religion: but I have nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say to that.</HI> One of them said he'd give five shillings to see him; the other offer'd eight. Upon which my father stepp'd up to them; but they said not one word to him. One of them presently informed the bishop he was come. Whereupon the bishop dismiss'd his company, and had him up stairs. My father found him sented in his chair, with his hat under his arm, assuming a majestic air. My father stood silent a while; and seeing the bishop didn't begin with him, he approach'd nearer, and thus accosted him: 'Old man my business is with thee.'</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is your business with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard thou hast sent out thy bailiffs to take me: but I rather chose to come myself, to know what wrong I have done thee. If it appear I have done thee any, I am ready to make thee satisfaction: but if, upon enquiry, I ap∣pear to be innocent, I desire thee, for thy own soul's sake, thou do'st not injure me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are misinform'd, friend; I am not your adversary</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I desire thee to tell me who is my adversary, that I may go and agree with him while I am in the way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>The king is your adversary. The king's laws you have broken: And to the king you shall answer; that's more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our subjection to laws is either active or passive. So that if a man can't, for con∣science sake, do the thing the law requires, but 
<PB N="31" REF="007113_0030_102AFEF5F1D1FF70"/>
passively suffers what the law inflicts, the law, I conceive, is as fully answer'd as it he had actual∣ly obey'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are wrong in that too: for sup∣pose a man steal an ox, and then be taken, and hang'd for the fact; what restitution is that to the owner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>None at all. But tho' it is no restitution to the owner, yet the law is satisfied. Tho' the owner be a loter, the criminal has suf∣ferr'd the punishment the law inflicts, as an equi∣valent for the crime committed. But thou may'st see the corruptness of such laws, which put the life of a man upon a level with the life of a beast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! do such men as you find fault with the laws?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: and I'll tell thee plainly, 'tis high time wiser men were chosen, to make better laws. For if this thief was taken and sold for a proper term, according to the law of <HI>Moses,</HI> and the owner had four oxen for his ox, and four sheep for his sheep, he would be satisfied, and the man's life preserved, that he might repent, and amend his ways.—But I hope thou dost not accuse me of having stole any man's ox or ass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; God forbid!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, if thou pleasest to give me leave, I'll state a case more parallel to the matter in hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>There liv'd in days past <HI>Nebu∣chadnezzar,</HI> king of <HI>Babylon,</HI> who set up an image, and made a decree, that all who would not bow to it should be cast the same hour into a burning fiery furnace. There were then three young men, who served the same God that I do now, and these durst not bow down to it; but passively 
<PB N="32" REF="007113_0031_102AFEF77856F170"/>
submitted their bodies to the flames. Was not that a sufficient satisfaction to the unjust decree of the king?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: God forbid else! — For that was to worship the workmanship of mens hands; which is idolatry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that thy judgment, that to wor∣ship the workmanship of men's hands is idolatry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then give me leave to ask thee, by whose hands the common-prayer-book was made, I am sure it was made by somebody's hands, for it could not make itself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you compare our common-prayer∣book to <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s image?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I do: that was his image, and this is thine. And be it known unto thee, I speak in the dread of the God of heaven, I no more dare bow to thy common-prayer-book than the three children could to <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s image.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yours is a strange upstart religion, of a very few years standing, and you are grown so confident in it, that there is no beating you out of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out of my religion? God for∣bid! I was a long time seeking acquaintance with the living God amongst the dead forms of wor∣ship, and enquiring after the right way and wor∣ship of God, before I could find it; and now, I hope neither thou nor any man living shall be a∣ble to persuade me out of it. But tho' thou art an antient man and a bishop, I find thou art very ignorant of the rise and antiquity of our religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>(Smiling) Do you <HI>Quakers</HI> pretend antiquity for your religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and I don't question but, with the help of God, I can make it appear, that 
<PB N="33" REF="007113_0032_102AFEF9039E9708"/>
our religion was many hundred years before thine was thought of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see I have given you liberty of discourse, and have not sought to ensnare you in your words; but if you can make the <HI>Quakers</HI> religion appear to be many hundred years older than mine, you'll speed the better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I do not, I seek no favor at thy hands, and, in order to it, I hope thou'lt give me liberty to ask a few sober questions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then first I would ask thee where was thy religion in <HI>Oliver's</HI> days? The common-prayer-book was then become (even a∣mong the clergy) like an old almanack, very few regarding it in our country. There were two or three priests indeed, who stood honestly to their principles, and suffered pretty much; but the far greater number turn'd with the tide: and we have reason to believe, that if <HI>Oliver</HI> would have put mass into their mouths, they would have conform'd even to that for their bellies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>What wou'd you have us do? wou'd you have had <HI>Oliver</HI> cut our throats?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, by no means. But what religion was that you were afraid to venture your throats for? Be it known unto thee, I ventur'd my throat for my religion in <HI>Oliver's</HI> days, as I do now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I must tell you, tho' in <HI>Oliver's</HI> days I did not dare to own it as I do now, yet I never own'd any other religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I suppose thou mad'st <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conscience of it; and I should abundantly rather chuse to fall into such a man's hands, than into the hand of one who makes no conscience to∣wards 
<PB N="34" REF="007113_0033_102AFEFAB33E4940"/>
God, but will conform to any thing for his belly. But if thou did'st not think thy religi∣on worth venturing thy throat for in <HI>Oliver</HI>'s days, I desire thee to consider, it is not worth cutting other mens throats now, for not conform∣ing to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say right: I hope we shall have a care how we cut mens throats. (Several others were now come into the room.) But you know the common-prayer-book was before <HI>Oliver's</HI> days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: I have a great deal of rea∣son to know that; for I was bred up under a com∣mon-prayer-priest, and a poor old drunken man he was: sometimes he was so drunk he could not say his prayers, and at best he could but say 'em; tho' I think he was by far a better man than he that is priest there now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who is your minister now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>My minister is Christ Jesus, the minister of the everlasting covenant; but the pre∣sent priest of the parish is <HI>George Bull.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you say that drunken old man was better than Mr. <HI>Bull</HI>? I tell you, I account Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> as sound, able, and orthodox a divine as any we have among us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for that; for if he is one of the best of you, I believe the Lord will not suffer you long: for he is a proud, ambitious, ungodly man, he hath often sued me at law, and brought his servants to swear against me wrong∣fully. His servants themselves have confess'd to my servants, that I might have their ears; for their master made 'em drunk and then told 'em they were set down in the list a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> witnesses against me, and they must swear to it, and so they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and brought treble damages. They likewise own∣ed 
<PB N="35" REF="007113_0034_102AFEFDEB82DEC8"/>
they took tythes from my servant, threshed 'em out, and sold 'em for their master. They have also several times took my cattle out of my grounds, drove 'em to fairs and markets, and sold them without giving me any account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do assure you I will inform Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> of what you say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well. And if thou pleas∣est to send for me to face him, I shall make much more appear to his face than I'll say behind his back.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I remember you said you could make it appear that your religion was long before mine; and that is what I want to hear you make out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our religion, as thou may'st read in the scripture (<HI>John</HI> iv.) was set up by Christ himself, between sixteen and seventeen hundred years ago: and he had full power to e∣stablish the true religion in his church, when he told the woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> that neither at that mountain, nor yet at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> was the place of true worship. They worshipped they knew not what. For said he, God is a Spirit, <HI>and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.</HI></P>
<P>This is our religion, and hath ever been the re∣ligion of all those who have worshipped God ac∣ceptably thro' the several ages since down to this time; and will be the religion of the true spiri∣tual worshippers of God to the world's end; a religion perform'd by the assistance of the spirit of God, because God is a spirit; a religion esta∣blish'd by Christ himself before the mass-book, service-book or directory, or any of those in∣ventions and traditions of men, which in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of apostacy were set up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are all the <HI>Quakers</HI> of the same opinion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="36" REF="007113_0035_102AFEFFFB607468"/>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes they are. If any hold doctrines contrary to that taught by our Saviour to the woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> they are not of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you own the Trinity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't remember such a word in the holy scriptures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you own three persons?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe according to the scrip∣ture, that <HI>there are Three that bear record in heaven,</HI> and that <HI>those Three are One:</HI> thou may'st make as many persons of them as thou canst. But I would soberl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ask thee, since the scriptures say the hea∣ven of heavens cannot contain him, and that he is incomprehensible, by what person or likeness canst thou comprehend the Almighty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yours is the strangest of all persua∣sions: for tho' there are many sects (which he named) and tho' they and we differ in some cir∣cumstances, yet in fundamentals we agree as one. But I observe you, of all others, strike at the very root and basis of our religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Art thou sensible of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad of that; for the root is the rottenness, and truth strikes at the very foundation thereof. That little stone which <HI>Da∣viel</HI> saw cut out of the mountain without hands will overturn all in God's due time, when you have done all you can to support it. But, as to those others thou mention'st, there is so little difference between you, that wise men wonder why you differ at all; only we read, <HI>the beast had many heads, and many horns, which push against each other.</HI></P>
<P>And yet I am fully persuaned, there are many in this day true spiritual worshippers in all persuasions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="37" REF="007113_0036_102AFF01CF830DD8"/>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you will not give us the same li∣berty you give a common mechanic to call our tools by their own names.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire thee to explain thy self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you will give a carpenter leave to call his gimblet a gimblet, and his gouge a gouge; but you call our church a mass-house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you were half so honest men as carpenters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why? do you upbraid us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not upbraid you; but I'll endeavor to shew thee wherein you fall short of carpenters. Suppose I have a son intended to learn the trade of a carpenter; I indent with an honest man of that calling, in consideration of so much money, to teach my son his trade in such a term of years; at the end of which term my son may be as good, or perhaps a better workman than his master, and he shall be at liberty from him to follow the business for himself. Now will you be so honest as this carpenter? You are men who pretend to know more of light, life, and salva∣tion, and things pertaining to the kingdom of hea∣ven, than we do: I would ask in how long a time you would undertake to teach us as much as you know? and what shall we give you, that we may be once free from our masters? But here you keep us always learning, that we may be always paying you. Plainly 'tis a very cheat. What! always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of God! miserable sinners you found us, and miserable sinners you leave us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you against confession?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, for I believe those who confess and forsake their sins shall find mercy at the hand of God; but those who persist in them shall be punished. But if ever you intend to be 
<PB N="38" REF="007113_0037_102AFF036CE4BCA0"/>
better, you must throw away your old book, and get a new one, or turn over a new leaf; for if you keep on in your old lesson, you must always be doing what you ought not, and leaving undone what ye out to do; and you can never do worse. I believe, in my heart, you mock God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>How dare you say?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll state the case, and thou shalt judge. Suppose thou had'st a son, and thou should'st daily let him know what thou would'st have him to do, and he should day by day, week by week, and year after year provoke thee to thy face, and say, father, I have not done what thou commandedst me to do; but have done quite the contrary; and continue to provoke thee to thy face in this manner once or oft'ner every week, would'st thou not think him a rebellious child, and that his application to thee was mere mockery? and would it not occasion thee to disinherit him?</P>
</SP>
<P>After some more discourse, my father told him time was far spent; and said, "If nothing will serve thee but my body in a prison, here it is in thy power; and if thou commandest me to deli∣ver myself up, either to the sheriff, or to the jailor of <HI>Gloucester</HI> castle, as thy prisoner, I will go, and seek no other judge, advocate, or at∣torney to plead my cause, but the great Judge of heaven and earth, who knows I have nothing but love and goodwill in my heart to thee and all mankind."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; you shall go home about your business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I desire thee for the fu∣ture not to trouble thyself to send any more bai∣liffs after me; for if thou pleasest it any time to let me know by a line or two, that thou would'st 
<PB N="39" REF="007113_0038_102AFF074BDD46F8"/>
speak with me, tho' it be to send me to prison, if I am well and able, I'll come.</P>
</SP>
<P>The <HI>Bishop</HI> then call'd for something to drink; but my father acknowledg'd his kindness, and ex∣cused himself from drinking. And the bishop being call'd out of the room, one <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> who took offence at my father's freedom with the bishop, said, <HI>Haywood,</HI> you are affraid of nothing; I never met with such a man in my life. I'm a∣fraid of my life, left such fanatics as you should cut my throat as I sleep.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't wonder that thou art afraid.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cuthbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should I be afraid any more than you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I am under the pro∣tection of him who numbreth the very hairs of my head, and without whose providence a spar∣row shall not fall to the ground; but thou hast <HI>Cain</HI>'s mark of envy on thy forehead, and like him art afraid whoever meets thee will kill thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Cuthbert.</SPEAKER>
<P>(In a great rage) If all the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>England</HI> are not hanged in a month's time, I'll be hanged for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>(Smiling) Prithee, friend, re∣member and be as good as thy word.</P>
</SP>
<P>My father, and his friend <HI>Amariah Drewett,</HI> then took their leave, and returned home with the answer of peace in their bosoms.</P>
<P>Some time after this, the bishop and the chan∣cellor in their coaches, accompanied with <HI>The Masters,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in his coach, and about so clergy∣men on horseback, made my father's house in their way to a visitation, which was to be at <HI>Ted∣bury</HI> the next day. They stopped at the gate, and <HI>George Evans,</HI> the bishop's kinsman, rode into the yard to call my father; who coming to the
<PB N="40" REF="007113_0039_102AFF08D30CCCF0"/>
bishop's coach-side, he put out his hand (which my father respectfully took) saying, <HI>I could not well go out of the county without seeing you.</HI> That's very kind (said my father) wilt thou please to alight and come in, with those who are along with thee?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, <HI>John</HI>; we are going to <HI>Tedbury,</HI> and time will not admit of it now; but I will drink with you if you please.</P>
</SP>
<P>My father went in, and ordered some drink to be brought, and then returned to the coach∣side.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George Evans.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>John,</HI> is your house free to entertain such men as we are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>George</HI>; I entertain honest men, and sometimes others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George Evans.</SPEAKER>
<P>(to the bishop) My lord, <HI>John</HI>'s friends are the honest men, and we are the o∣thers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's not fair, <HI>George,</HI> for thee to put thy construction on my words: thou should'st have given me leave to do that.</P>
</SP>
<P>'Squire <HI>Masters</HI> came out of his coach, and stood by the bishop's coach-side; and the chan∣cellor, in a diverting humor, said to my father, 'My lord and these gentlemen have been to see your burying-ground, and we think you keep it very decent.' (This piece of ground my father had given to friends for that purpose; it lay at the lower end of his orchard.) My father an∣swered yes; tho' we are against pride, we think it commendable to be decent.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Chancellor.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there is one thing among you, which I did not expect to see; I think it looks a little superstitious; I mean those grave-stones which are placed at the head and feet of your graves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="41" REF="007113_0040_102AFF0AA52E2488"/>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I consess is what I cannot much plead for; but it was permitted to gratify some who had their relations there interred. We, notwithstanding, propose to have them taken up e'er long, and converted to some better use. But I desire thee to take notice, we had it from among you, and I have observed in many things wherein we have taken you for our pat∣tern you have led us wrong; and therefore we are now resolved, with the help of God, not to follow you one step further.</P>
</SP>
<P>At this the bishop smiled, and said, <HI>John, I think your beer is long a coming.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose my wife is willing thou should'st have the best, and therefore stays to broach a fresh vessel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, if it be for the best, we'll stay.</P>
</SP>
<P>Presently my mother brought the drink, and when the bishop had drank, he said, <HI>I commend you</HI> John, <HI>you keep a cup of good beer in your house. I have not drank any that pleased me better since I came from home.</HI> The chancellor drank next and the cup coming round again to my father's hand, 'squire <HI>Masters</HI> said to him, <HI>Now, old school-fellow, I hope you'll drink to me?</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou know'st it is not my prac∣tice to drink to any man; if it was, I would as soon drink to thee as another, as being my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> acquaintance and school-fellow; but if th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pleased to drink, thou art very welcome.</P>
</SP>
<P>The 'squire then taking the cup into his hand, said, <HI>Now,</HI> John, <HI>before my lord and all those gentlemen, tell me what ceremony or compliment do you</HI> Quakers <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when you drink to one another.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>None at all. For me to drink to another, and drink the liquor, is at best but a compliment, and that borders much on a lie.</P>

<PB N="42" REF="007113_0041_102AFF0DCF76F818"/>
<SPEAKER>'Squire <HI>Masters.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What do you do then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, If I have a mind to drink, I take the cup and drink; and if my friend pleases, he does the same; if not, he may let it alone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>'Squire <HI>Masters.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Honest <HI>John,</HI> give me thy hand. Here's to thee with all my heart; and, according to thy own compliment, if thou wilt drink, thou may'st, if not, thou may'st let it alone.</P>
</SP>
<P>My father then offering the cup to priest <HI>Bull,</HI> he refused it, saying, <HI>It is full of hops and heresy.</HI> To which my father reply'd, As for hops, I can∣not say much, not being at the brewing of it; but as for heresy, I do assure thee neighbor <HI>Bull,</HI> there's none in my beer; and if thou pleasest to drink, thou art welcome; but if not, I desire thee to take notice, as good as thee will; and those are as well able to judge of heresy. Here thy lord bishop hath drank of it, and commends it; he finds no heresy in the cup.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>(Leaning over the coach door, and whispering to my father, said) <HI>John,</HI> I advise you to take care you don't offend against the higher powers. I have heard great complaints against you, that you are the ringleader of the <HI>Quakers</HI> in this country; and that if you are not suppress'd, all will signify nothing. Therefore, pray <HI>John</HI> take care for the future, and don't of∣fend any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like thy counsel very well, and intend to cake it. but thou know'st God is the higher power; and you mortal men, how∣ever advanced in this world, are but the lower power; and it is only because I endeavor to be obedient to the will of the higher powers, that the lower powers are angry with me. But I
<PB N="43" REF="007113_0042_102AFF0FDF1E1468"/>
hope, with the assistance of God, to take thy counsel, and be subject to the higher powers, let the lower powers do with me as it may please God to suffer them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I want some more discourse with you. Will you go with me to Mr. <HI>Bull</HI>'s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou know'st he hath no good∣will for me. I had rather attend on thee else∣where.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop,</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you come to-morrow to <HI>Tedbury?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, If thou desirest it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I do.</P>
</SP>
<P>The bishop then took his leave, and went not to <HI>George Bull</HI>'s, at which he was very much of∣fended.</P>
<P>Next morning my father took his son <HI>Nathaniel</HI> with him, in case the bishop (in compliance with the violent clamors of the priests) should send him to Prison, which he expected. As they were passing along a street in <HI>Tedbury</HI> they were met by <HI>Anthony Sharp,</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> whose mother lived at <HI>Tedbury.</HI> After he understood by my father where he was going, he ask'd if he would accept of a companion? <HI>If thou hast a mind to go to prison,</HI> says my father, <HI>thou may'st go with me.</HI> I'll venture that (reply'd <HI>Anthony</HI>) for if I do, I shall have good company. When they came to the foot of the stairs which led up to the bishop's chamber, they were espy'd by <HI>George Evans,</HI> who said, come up, <HI>John</HI>; my lord thought you long. When they came up, the bishop was just setting down to dinner, with a number of clergymen; and offering to make room for my father he ex∣cused himself, and retired with his friend till dinner was over. The bishop spoke to the wo∣man of the house for another room, which (it 
<PB N="44" REF="007113_0043_102AFF11647530E0"/>
being market-day) was soon filled with priests and clothiers, &amp;c.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>(Putting on a stern countenance) said, come, <HI>John,</HI> I must turn over a new leaf with you. If you will not promise me to go to church, and to keep no more of these seditious conven∣ticles at your house, I must make your mittimus and send you to prison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would'st thou have me shut my doors against my friends? It was but yester∣day that thou thyself, and many others here present, were at my house; and I was so far from shutting my doors against you, that I invired you in, and you should have been welcome to the best entertainment I had.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is those meetings I speak of which you keep at your house, to the terror of the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>This I'll promise thee, before all this company, that if any plotters or ill-minded persons come to my house to plot or conspire against the king or government, if I know of it, I'll be the first informer against them myself, tho' I have not a penny for my labor. But if honest and sober people come to my house, to wait upon, and worship the God of heaven, in spirit and in truth, such shall be welcome to me as long as I have a house for 'em to meet in; and if I should have none, the Lord will provide one for 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you promise to go to your own parish-church to hear divine service?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can promise no such thing. The last time I was there, I was moved and re∣quired of the Lord, whom I serve, to bear my testimony against a hireling priest, who was preaching for hire and divining for money; and 
<PB N="45" REF="007113_0044_102AFF12E95DD800"/>
he was angry with me, and caused the people to turn me out. And I don't intend to trouble him again till he learn more civility, except the Lord requires it of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Send for the constable: I must take an∣other course.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>If thou should'st come to my house under a pretence of friendship, and, in a <HI>Judas</HI> like manner, betray me hither to send me to prison, as I have hitherto commended thee for thy moderation, I should then have occasion to put thy name in print, and cause it to stink before all sober people. But it is those who set thee on to mischief. I would not have thee hearken to 'em, but bid 'em take up some honest vocation, and rob their honest neighbors no longer. They are like a company of carerpillars who destroy the fruit of the earth, and live on the fruit of other mens labor.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then priest <HI>Rich,</HI> of <HI>North-Surray,</HI> said, who are those you call caterpillars?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>We herdsmen call them cater∣pillars, who live on the fruit of other mens fields, and on the sweat of other mens brows. And if thou dost so, thou may'st be one of them.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rich.</SPEAKER>
<P>May it please your lordship, if you suf∣fer such a man as this to <HI>thou</HI> your lordship, and call you <HI>old man,</HI> what will become of us?</P>

<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>We honor old age, if it be found in the way of well-doing; but one would not think you should be such dunces as to forget grammar rules. You bred up at <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cam∣bridge!</HI> For what? I, that am a layman, and bred at the plow-tail, understand the singular and plural numbers. <HI>Thee</HI> and <HI>Thou</HI> is proper to a single person, if it be to a prince: thou know'st it old man.

Is it, <HI>You O Lord,</HI> or <HI>Thou O Lord,</HI> in your prayers? Will you not accept the same language from your fellow mortals, which you give to the Almighty? What spirit was that in proud <HI>Haman</HI> that would have poor <HI>Mordecai</HI> to bow to him?</P>

<P>What's your business here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony Sharp.</SPEAKER>
<P>My mother lives in this town: And as she is such, and an ancient woman, I thought it my duty to come and see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>He only came hither in good∣will to bear me company. If thou pleasest, lay the more on me, and let him go free.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; he may be as dangerous a person as yourself; and as you came for company, you shall go for company. Send for the constable to take them into custody.</P>
</SP>
<P>The woman of the house understanding the constable was to be sent for, dispatch'd a messen∣ger to him to bid him get out of the way. But the messenger missing him, he came to the house by accident. To whom the landlady said, 'What do you here, when honest <HI>John Haywood</HI> is going to be sent to prison? Here, come along with me.' The constable being willing, she conceal'd him in another room, and the bishop's messenger bring∣ing him word that the constable was not to be found, he said to my father:—</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here are many gentlemen who have a great way home, and I can send you to prison in the afternoon; so you may take your liberty until six of the clock.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="47" REF="007113_0046_102AFF1686FC8B30"/>
My father perceived his intent was to get rid of his company. So he withdrew with his friend <HI>Anthony Sharp</HI>; and at six a clock returned with∣out him, and found only two persons with the bishop, <HI>i.e. Edward Barnet,</HI> a surgeon of <HI>Cocker∣ton,</HI> and parson <HI>Hall.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, <HI>John,</HI> you are come. 'Tis well; I want some more discourse with you.</P>

<P>An't please you, my lord, let me discourse with him.</P>

<P>Ay, do, Mr. <HI>Hall, John</HI> will give you an answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parson <HI>Hall.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a great pity such men as you should have the light, sight and knowledge of the scriptures; for the knowledge of the scriptures hath made you mad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should I not have the priviledge of buying the scriptures for my money as well as thee or any other man? But you priests, like the <HI>Papists,</HI> wou'd have us laymen kept in ignorance, that we might pin our faith on your sleeves; and so the blind lead the blind till both fall into the ditch. But if the knowledge of the scriptures hath made me mad, the knowledge of the sack-pot hath almost made thee mad; and if we two mad men should dispute about religion▪ we should make mad work of it. But, as thou art an unworthy man, I'll not dispute with thee.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parson <HI>Hall.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>An't please you, my lord, he says I am drunk.</P>

<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wilt thou speak an untruth be∣fore thy lord-bishop?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Parson <HI>Hall.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>He did say I was drunk, my lord</P>

<P><PB N="48" REF="007113_0047_102AFF1A2E8CBF80"/>
My father repeating what he said before, the bishop held up his hands, and smiling, said, <HI>Did you say so,</HI> John? By which <HI>Hall</HI> perceiving the bishop did not incline to favor him, went away in a huff▪ The bishop then directing his dis∣course to my father, said; '<HI>John,</HI> I thought you dealt hardly with me to-day, in telling me, before so many gentlemen, that I came to your house in a <HI>Judas</HI> like manner, and betray'd you hither to send you to prison: for if I had not done what I did, people would have reported me an encou∣rager of the <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>

<P>If they had, it would have been no discredit to thee.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come now, <HI>John,</HI> I'll burn your mittimus before your face. And now Mr. <HI>Bar∣not,</HI> I have a mind to ask <HI>John</HI> some questions. <HI>John,</HI> I have heard Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> say strange things of you: that you can tell where to find any thing that's lost as well as any cunning man, but I desire to hear it from your own mouth. 'Twas about some cows that a neighbor had lost, and could no where find them, till they apply'd to you</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>If thou pleasest to hear me, I'll tell thee the truth of that story.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do; I shall believe you, <HI>John.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had a poor neighbor, who had a wife and six children, and whom the chief men about us permitted to keep six or seven cows upon the waste, which were the principal support of his family, and preserv'd 'em from becoming chargeable to the parish. One very stormy night the cattle were left in the yard, as usual; but could not be found in the morning. The man and his sons had sought 'em to no purpose: and after they had been lost 4 days, his wife came to me, and, in a great deal of grief, cry'd, O Lord! 
<PB N="49" REF="007113_0048_102AFF1BB45C01C8"/>
master <HI>Haywood,</HI> we are undone! my husband and I must go a begging in our old age! we have lost all our cows! my husband and the boys have been round the country, and can hear nothing of them, I'll down on my bare knees if you'll stand our friend? I desired she would not be in such an agony, and told her she should not down on her knees to me; but I would gladly help them in what I could. I know, <HI>said she,</HI> you are a good man, and God will hear your prayers. I desire thee (said I) to be still and quiet in thy mind; perhaps thy husband or son may hear of 'em to day: if not, let thy husband get a horse, and come to me to-morrow morning as soon as he will; and I think, if it please God, to go with him to seek them. The woman seem'd transport∣ed with joy, crying, <HI>Then we shall have our cows again!</HI> Her faith being so strong, brought the greater exercise upon me, with strong cries unto the Lord, that he would be pleased to make me instru∣mental in his hand, for the help of the poor family. In the morning early comes the old man, <HI>In the name of God,</HI> says he, <HI>which way shall we go and seek them?</HI> I being deeply concerned in my mind, did not answer him till he had thrice repeated it; and then I answered, "In the name of God we will go to seek them (and said before I was aware) we will go to <HI>Malmsbury,</HI> and at the horse fair we shall find them." When I had spoken the words, I was much troubled lest they should not prove true. It was very early, and the first man we saw, I ask'd him if he had seen any stray milch cows thereabouts? <HI>What manner of cattle are they?</HI> said he. And the old man describing of their marks and number, he told us there were some stood chewing their cuds in their horse fair; but thinking they belonged to some in the neigh∣borhood, 
<PB N="50" REF="007113_0049_102AFF1D44E904E0"/>
he did not take particular notice of them. When we came to the place, the old man found 'em to be his; but suffered his transports of joy to rise so high, that I was ashamed of his behavior; for he fell a hallowing, and threw up his mountier cap in the air several times, 'till he raised the neighbors out of their beds to see what was the matter. <HI>O</HI> (said he) <HI>I had lost my cows four or five days ago, and thought I should never see them again; and this honest neighbor of mine, told me this morning by his own fire side, nine miles off, that here I should find them, and here I have them!</HI> Then up goes his cap again. I begged of the poor man to be quiet, and take his cows home, and be thankful, as indeed I was, being reve∣rently bowed in my spirit before the Lord, in that he was pleased to put the words of truth into my mouth. And the man drove his cattle home, to the great joy of his family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember another Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> told me, about a parcel of sheep a neighbor had lost, and you told him where to find them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>The truth of the story is this: a neighbor of mine, one <HI>John Curtis</HI> (at that time a domestic of <HI>George Bull's</HI>) kept some sheep of his own; and it so fell out that he lost them for some days; but happening to see me, and know∣ing I went pretty much abroad, he desired me if I should see them any where in my travels, to let him know of it. It happened the next day, as I was riding towards my own field, my dogs being with me, put up a hare, and seeing they were likely to kill her, I rode up to take them off, that she might escape, and by meer accident, I espy'd J. CURTIS's sheep in one corner of the field, in a thick briery part of the hedge, wherein they stood as secure as if they had been in a 
<PB N="51" REF="007113_0050_102AFF2071F43540"/>
pound. I suppose they had been driven there by the hounds. When I came home I sent him word of it. And tho' this is no more than a common accident, I find <HI>George Bull</HI> hath endeavor'd to improve it to my disadvantage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember one story more he told me, about a horse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I shan't tire thy patience, I'll acquaint thee how that was. One <HI>Edward Symons</HI> came from <HI>London</HI> to see his parents at <HI>Siddington.</HI> They put his horse to grass with their own, in some ground beyond a part of mine, called the <HI>Fursen Leases,</HI> through which they went with the horse; and when they wanted to take him from grass, they could not find him. After he had been lost some time, and they had cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d him at several market towns, somebody (who, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> likely, might have heard the former stories told, as thou might'st hear them) directed this <HI>Edward Symons</HI> to me, who telling me the case, I ask'd him which way they had the horse to grass? He answer'd through the <HI>Fursen Leases.</HI></P>
<P>I said, the horse being a stranger in the place, 'tis very likely he might endeavor to bend homewards, and loose himself in the <HI>Fursen Leases</HI>; for there are a great many acres under that name, which are so overgrown with furse-bushes, that a horse may lie there conceal'd a long time. I therefore advised him to get a good deal of company, and search the places diligently, as if they were beat∣ing for a hare; which if he did, I told him I was of the mind he would find him. The man did take my advice, and found him. And where's the cunning of all this? 'Tis no more than their own reason might have directed them to, had they properly considered the case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="52" REF="007113_0051_102AFF22D35D2F10"/>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nted to hear these stories from your own mouth, tho' I did not, nor should I have credited them, in the sense Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> related them. But I believe you, <HI>John.</HI> And now, Mr. <HI>Barnet,</HI> we'll ask <HI>John</HI> some serious questions. I can com∣pare him to nothing but a good ring of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ls. You know, Mr. <HI>Barnet,</HI> a ring of bells may be made of as good metal as can be put into bells; but they may be out of tune: so we may say of <HI>John</HI>; he is a man of as good metal as I ever met with, but he is quite out of tune.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou may'st well say so; for I can't tune after thy pipe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I remember to have read, at the preaching of the apostle the heart of <HI>Lydia</HI> was open'd. Can you tell us what it was that opened the heart of <HI>Lydia?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe I can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought so. I desire you to do it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was nothing but the key of <HI>David.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, now JOHN, I think you are going wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>If thou pleasest to speak, I'll hear thee; but if thou would'st have me speak, I desire thee to hear me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, Mr. <HI>Barnet,</HI> we'll hear <HI>John.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is written, <HI>Thou hast the key of</HI> David, <HI>which opens, and none can shut; and if thou shut'st, none can open.</HI></P>
<P>And that is no other but the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ. It was the same spiritual key that open'd the heart of <HI>Moses,</HI> the first penman of the seripture, and gave him a sight of things from the beginning. It was the same spiritual key that opened the hearts of all the holy patriarchs, prophets and apostles, in ages past, who left their experience of the things 
<PB N="53" REF="007113_0052_102AFF246AD1E618"/>
of God upon record: which if they had not done, you bishops and priests would not have any thing to make a trade of; for it is by telling the experiences of these holy men, that you get your great bishoprics and personages. And the same spiritual key, hath, blessed be God, open<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the hearts of thousands in this age; and the same spiritual key hath, in a measure, open'd my heart, and given me to destinguish things that differ. And it must be the same that must open thy heart, if ever thou comest to have it truly open'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the truth, the very truth. I never heard it so defined before. <HI>John,</HI> I have done you much wrong: I desire you to forgive me; and I'll never wrong you more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do heartily forgive thee, as far as it is in my power; and I truly pray the father of mercies may forgive thee, and make thee his. As to the latter part, that thou wilt never wrong me more; I am of the same mind with thee; for it is in my heart to tell thee, I shall never see thy face any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bishop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard you once told the jailor of <HI>Gloucester</HI> so, and it proved true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>That jailor had been very cruel to me, and the rest of our friends, who were then prisoners He had kept us in prison from the session to the assize, and from the assize to the session, omitting to put our names in the kalender, that we might have had a hearing. At length I found means, at an assize time, to acquaint the judge (by letter) of his illegal proceedings. In consequence of which we were ordered to be put on the kalender, had a hearing, and were acquit∣ted. The judge severely reprimanded the jailor, saying, "Sirrah! if ever I hear that you do the like for the future, I'll take care that you shall be jai∣lor

here no longer. Shall I come here to hear and determine causes, and shall you keep men in prison during your pleasure, and not put their names in the kalender?" The jailor coming out of the castle was heard by the turnkey to say, "It was about <HI>Haywood</HI> that I was so severely repri∣manded by the judge; and if ever he comes into the castle again, he shall never come out alive." Upon which the turnkey took an opportunity to find me out, and informing me of it, said, 'I would not have you by any means come back to the castle to-night, to fetch any of your things; for if you do, he'll certainly detain you for his fees. I'll take equal care of your things, as if yourself were present to do it.' I acknowledged his kindness, and went home. When the jailor return'd to the castle, he ask'd the turnkey where the <HI>Quakers</HI> were? He answer'd, he tho't it his business to take care of the felons, and to leave the <HI>Quakers</HI> to him. Not long after, being constable I secur'd a felon who broke out of the castle, and sent the turnkey notice of it. He coming over to fetch him back, begg'd, if by any means I could prevent it, that I would not come any more a prisoner to the castle whil'st his master was jailor; "For (says he) if you do, he swears you shall never go out alive; and that hour you come in, I'll leave the castle; for I can't stay there to see you abused." Does he still say so? said I. Yes, he does, said he. "Then re∣member me to him (said I) and tell him from me, I shall never see his face any more! Soon after it pleased God to take him away by death; and in a little time I was had prisoner there again.</P>

Which being done, my father said, 'The seats are our own, and we may as well sit as stand.' So the friends fat down: but presently after they were broken up and dispers'd.—Not long after <HI>John Timbrel,</HI> a friend, of <HI>Cirencester,</HI> wrote to justice <HI>Burcher,</HI> and told him (amongst other things) he had till then a better opinion of him than to think he would set his hand to such a work; and that he was sorry that he should be one in it. Sir JOHN, being acquainted with it by justice <HI>Burcher,</HI> sent out a special warrant against JOHN TIMBRLL. The constable who had it to serve was so civil to inform him of it, and tell him he would not serve it on him till his market was over. However, he left his market, came to my father, told him of the warrant, and ask'd his advice. My father advised him not to stay for the serv∣ing of the warrant, but go directly to Sir JOHN. He engaging my father to accompany him, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>way they went.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometime ago, several of my friends being met, together with me in a peace∣able manner, to worship God, at <HI>Stoke Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ard,</HI> thy father came in with a file of musqueteers at his heels, and beat and abus'd us very much. I then warn'd him in abundance of love. Yet he did not seem to regard it, but sent about 12 of us to <HI>Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cester</HI> castle. I then told him God would plead our cause with him. And I was credibly inform'd, that, not the very night, but the next night after, he went to bed as well in appear∣ance as usual; but in the morning, he not ring∣ing a certain bell, which he had by him for that purpose, at the time he us'd to do, his house∣keeper went up several times, and thought he was asleep. But at length, suspecting something more than ordinary, she made a closer inspection; and, perceiving his countenance chang'd, she threw open the curtains in a great surprise. On which, he just flash'd open his eyes, but said not a word. She ask'd him how he did? but he made no answer. Which made her cry more earnestly; 'Pray, sir, how do you do? How is it with you? For God's sake tell me. And all he said to her was, Oh! these <HI>Quakers!</HI> Oh! these <HI>Quakers!</HI> Would to God I had never had a hand against these 
<PB N="59" REF="007113_0058_102AFF31EC7BE0E0"/>
<HI>Quakers!</HI> I did not hear that ever be spoke more.</P>
</SP>
<P>Sir JOHN seem'd surprised at this relation, and did not contradict it in the least; which, it is reasonable to think, he would, and with resent∣ment too, had it not been true. Yet notwith∣standing this fair warning, he continued his prac∣tice of granting warrants against us. But the officers were generally so civil as to acquaint us with it in time. Some time after this, Sir <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. GUISE and Sir ROBT. ATKINS, being at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Brook,</HI> two miles from <HI>Cirencester,</HI> quarrell'd as they were gaming. Sir JOHN drew his sword, and demanded satisfaction: But those in the house stepp'd between and parted them. They seem∣ing to appear pacified, and sat down again. But afterwards, taking a walk together in the bow∣ling-green, the breast of Sir JOHN being filled with resentment, he said, Sir ROBERT, you gave me the lye; and I will have satisfaction.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I have said any thing more than what is common for gentlemen to say to each other in their play, betwixt you and I, I ask your pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you'll go in, and ask it before the people of the house, I will put it up; other∣wise I will not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir JOHN; that's beneat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then draw, or you shall die like a dog.—They both drew, and Sir ROBERT gave him a gentle prick in the arm, and said, I desire you, Sir JOHN, to take that for satisfac∣tion. I could have had you elsewhere; but was unwilling to do you further mischief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir JOHN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll kill or be kill'd.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir ROBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that be your mind, look to your self as well as you can; for I shall have you at the next pass.</P>
</SP>
<P>—And so he had; for he ran him through, in at the belly, and out at the back; on which he fell. Sir ROBERT stepp'd up to him, unbutton'd his cloaths, tore his shirt down, and gently drew out his sword; and then, after he had well suck'd the wound, taking his handker∣chief, he roll'd up the corners of it hard, and thrust it into the orifice: then buttoning of his cloaths, he lifted him up, and desired him while he was able, that he would acquaint the people of the house that his death was owing to his own seeking. And when they were come about him, he was so generous as to say, "If I die, Sir ROBERT is clear; for if he had not kill'd me, I would have kill'd him." Sir ROBERT procur'd him Surgeons: and, after a while, when great pain came upon him, he lamented himself much, and said, "It was the just hand of God upon me for meddling with the <HI>Quakers.</HI> But, if he will be pleased to spare me, and try me again, I'll never have a hand against them any more. For <HI>Haywood</HI> told me if I went on persecuting, the same hand that overtook my father would over∣take me, before I was aware. He further told me, I was set on by some envious priests; and I might have time to repent it. And so I do with all my heart. And 'tis true; I could never come into company with Mr. <HI>Careless</HI> or Mr. <HI>Freame,</HI> but they would be stirring me up to put the laws in execution against <HI>Dissenters.</HI>" The sword having miss'd his intrails, he recover'd, stood candidate for the county after, and never mere disturb'd our meetings.</P>
<P>The next thing I shall take notice of, is the proceeding of justice JAMES GEORGE, against my 
<PB N="61" REF="007113_0060_102AFF368AB54988"/>
father, my brother <HI>Nathaniel</HI> and myself. He came to the <HI>Ram</HI> in <HI>Cirencester,</HI> and sent for my brother and me. My father went with us. And when we came thither, he said:—"'Tis very well, JOHN, that you are come too. I sent for your sons, to let them know it is his majesty's pleasure to have the laws put in execution: and now I take this opportunity to let them and you know, that we must all be of one church.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou ought'st then to be well assured it is the right church. For if thou should'st be so far permitted to exercise the au∣thority thou art intrusted with, as to force a man, against his conscience, to conform to a wrong church, thou can'st not indemnify that man for so conforming in the day of account. I have read indeed, that our Saviour made a whip of small cords to whip the buyers and sellers <HI>out of the temple</HI>; but I never read that he whipt any <HI>in.</HI></P>
</SP>
<P>—The window of the room being open, we had a prospect of <HI>Cirencester</HI> tower; and the justice pointing to it, said, what do you call that, <HI>John</HI>?"</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou mayst call it a daw-house, if thou pleasest. Dos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'t thou see how the jack∣daws flock about it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Justice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, notwithstanding your jesting I warn you, in the king's name, that you meet no more, as you'll answer it at your peril.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, I suppose thou think'st thou hast done thy duty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Justice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I desire thee to give me leave to do my duty. And I do now warn thee, in the name of the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords▪ not to molest or hinder us in the peace∣able 
<PB N="62" REF="007113_0061_102AFF3928AE42C8"/>
exercise of our duty to God, as thou wilt answer it at another day.</P>
</SP>
<P>A little time after this, he sent to the officers, to bid 'em go to the <HI>Quakers</HI> meeting-house on sunday next, and bring their names to him. The officers were very unwilling to obey his commands; and some of them acquainted me with their orders, desiring we would not meet at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sual time, or otherwise that we would meet at another place. I told them, we did not dare <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> far to deny the Worship of our God: For, said I, we worship the same God that <HI>Daniel</HI> did: and he notwithstanding the severe decree of the king, failed not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to own God, by praying to him, with his window open as usual. And our God is the same he was in <HI>Daniel</HI>'s days, as able to stop the mouths of lions as he was then. And we are not afraid to trust him, having had experi∣ence of many deliverances he hath wrought for us. The next first day we met at the time and place we used to meet; and a good meeting we had, the living presence of the Lord being sen∣sibly felt amongst us. One of the constables came in, and delivered a warrant to my brother <HI>John,</HI> desiring him to read it. But my brother put it in his pocket, telling him he design'd to read it when the meeting was over, 'That will not do, said he; for if you will not read it now, I desire you to give it to me again.' Which he did. And then they took a list of several of our names, ond carried it to justice <HI>George.</HI> On which he sent out his warrants to distrain our goods. They seiz'd my father's corn in his barns, and lock'd up the barn-doors. And at that same time the murrain had seiz'd the justice's cattle, and they died apace. His steward told him, he must send for <HI>John Haywood,</HI> or he would loose all his cattle.
<PB N="63" REF="007113_0062_102AFF3B3A7CC740"/>
'No, said the justice, don't send for him no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ because I have warrants out against him and hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sons. Send for any body else.' So the steward sent for another; who did what he could for 'em, but to very little purpose, for the cattle continued to sicken and die as before. The steward then told him, 'Please your worship, if you don't send for <HI>John Haywood,</HI> I believe you will loose all your cattie; for now the bull is sick, and off his meat; and I don't find this man does them any good. But if you'll please to send for <HI>John,</HI> I don't question but he would be of service to them.' Send for him then, said the justice; but don't bring him in as you used to do. When he has done what he can, pay him, and dismiss him. So my father was sent for, and went (having learn∣ed that great christian lesson to return good for evil) and did his best for 'em. When he had done, as he was wiping his hands in the entry, the justice undesignedly came by him; and, seeing he could not avoid his notice, said, So, <HI>John,</HI> You have done something for my cattle, I suppose. Yes, said my father, and I hope it will do them good. Well (said the justice to the steward) pay <HI>John.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>JUSTICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't think your coming to drench and bleed my cattle shall deter me from exe∣cuting the king's laws.</P>

<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis time enough for thee to de∣ny me a favor when I ask it of thee. I seek no favor at thy hands. But when thou hast done 
<PB N="64" REF="007113_0063_102AFF3CC4A20518"/>

<P>Well, <HI>John,</HI> you must stay and dine with me.</P>

<P>Perhaps I shall intrude if I stay. I had rather be excus'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JUSTICE.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis no intrusion, <HI>John</HI>; you shall stay.</P>
</SP>
<P>So my father stay'd, and presented him with a piece of <HI>Thomas Elwood</HI>'s against persecution. Which, together with my father's readiness to serve him, so wrought on him, that I don't remember any of his corn was taken from him at that time. But my brother <HI>Nathaniel</HI> and myself, being part∣ners in trade in <HI>Cirencester,</HI> were fin'd by this justice <HI>George,</HI> for ourselves, and unable persons present with us at the meeting, seventy pounds.</P>
<P>Some time after came to our house Sir <HI>Thomas Cutter,</HI> with other justices, the sheriff of the county, his men, and two constables. Our neighbors in good will to us shut our doors, and the maid fasten'd them on the inside. But the justices gave orders they should be broke open. A young woman being in the shop when it was done, ran out at the back-door in a fright. Which Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> seeing, said, "There is one gone! There might as well be five hundred gone; I'll take my oath here was a conventicle." I, being near him, bid him take care what he said or swore, because he must give account, and he knew not how soon. A servant belonging to one of them took off my hat, and laid it on the table. I took it, and put it on again, saying, I hope a man may keep his hat on in his own house, without offonce to any man.</P>

<P>By not doing it. But if thou canst convince me by that book in thy hand (which was a bible) that it is lawful to swear, since Christ forbids it, then I will swear. For when men come and say you must swear or suffer, 'tis but reasonable to expect such men should be qualify'd to prove it lawful.

<P>Then they seiz'd what goods they pleas'd, and took 'em away with 'em. And after they had tender'd us oaths twice more, our mittimus was made, and we were sent to <HI>Gloucester Castle</HI>; where we sound several of our friends before us; and, with them that were sent in soon after us, we be∣came a family of forty or fifty. The jailor's name was <HI>John Landborne</HI>; and for a piece of ser∣vice I did him gratis in his absence, (<HI>i. e.</HI> offici∣ating as key-turner, and preventing two no∣torious robbers from breaking out) I could pre∣vail with him to let several of our friends go home, when occasion particularly required, for some time together. We, being a large number of us in prison, had often large meetings on the first∣days in the castle. Divers of the Prisoners, who were not of us, as well as several people out of the city, would come and sit down with us. Therefore <HI>Richard P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sons,</HI> one of our persecu∣tors, who liv'd in the city, came to our morning meeting, accompan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> with several others. My father was pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> with us, and <HI>Henry Panto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (who had formerly been a fencing master) was preaching, when they came in, concerning the confession of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, who perpetually say they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>g w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t they ought not, and leaving undone what they ought to do: which words <HI>Parsons</HI> (who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> a chancellor, and a justice) took ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ling him he was complaining of others for what he was doing himself: for (said he) you are now doing what you ought not, and leaving undone what you ought to do; catch∣ing, hold of his grey locks to pull him down. But <HI>Henry</HI> being a tall man, pretty strong and active, tho' in years, he stood his ground, and spoke 
<PB N="67" REF="007113_0066_102AFF4376888688"/>
over his head. <HI>Parsons</HI> then strove to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his mouth; but he avoided it, by turning his head on one side. When he had done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>aking, a friend stood up, and said, 'Tis a sign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> devil's hard put to it to have his drudgery don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that priests must leave their pulpits and parishoners, to take up the business of informers against poo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prisoners in the prison. After priest <HI>Parsons</HI> had been some time endeavoring to get the names of some present, and no body would give him inform∣ation, he thus broke out: 'If you are there∣abouts, I shall be even with you another way.' For he had got a list of several of the prisoners names; and taking for granted that they were all present at the time, he sent out his warrants for distraining their goods. However, herein he was mistaken; for several were then absent; among whom was <HI>Lettice Gush,</HI> a widow, who liv'd about 20 miles distant. Some officers being sent to her house to distrain her goods, for being at this meet∣ing, when she was 20 miles from the place. When the officers came, she told them she was not at the meeting: and to convince them, per∣swaded them to go with her to her landlord, who was also a justice of the peace, and knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> said to be true. When they came before him, and shew'd him the warrant, "What a rascal (said he) is this <HI>Parsons!</HI> Here he says he'll take his oath that my tenant was convicted by him of being at a conventicle in <HI>Gloucester</HI> castle such a day of the month; and I'll take my oath she was at home at the same time, which is 20 miles off. If you touch any of her goods by virtue of this warrant, be it at your peril. I'll assure you if you do, I'll stick close to your skirts." <HI>Officer.</HI> What can be done in this case? How can we make a legal return of the warrant without ex∣ecuting 
<PB N="68" REF="007113_0067_102AFF4534F32D00"/>
it? <HI>Landlord.</HI> Carry it back to Mr. <HI>Parsons,</HI> and tell him to wipe his breech with it; and I'll bear you out in it. So they returned, without giving her any further trouble.—An∣other warrant was issued out against <HI>Francis Boy,</HI> physician, on the same account, and of the same value, who was likewise absent at the time of his pretended conviction. When the officers came to disstrain his goods, he was not at home. So his cattle were take away to the value of between 20 and 30 l. He afterwards, on inspection, found by his books, that he was attending a gentleman the time he was said to be convicted. To this gentleman he went, and enquired of him if he could remember the day he attended him? The gentleman answer'd, 'He had good reason to remember it; for (said he) if you had not done what you did for me that day, I believe I should have been now in my grave.' He then in∣form'd the gentleman of the reason that induced him to give him that trouble. 'Well (replied he) I advise you to appeal to the next quarter-sessi∣ons for redress; and you may assure yourself I'll endeavor to serve you what lies in my power; for I'll take my oath before any judge or bench of justices in <HI>England,</HI> that you was with me that day.' But it so fell out that he had no occasion to appeal. For it soon took air that he had such a substantial evidence in his favor; and his cattle were returned before the sessions.</P>
<P>Not long after it pleased God to visit my dear father with sickness that proved mortal. I had leave to attend him the major part of the time he was sick: and the Lord was pleased to favor him with his living presence in his last moments: and having honorably finish'd his days work, he de∣parted this life in the year 1683, and was interred 
<PB N="69" REF="007113_0068_102AFF476E7520A0"/>
in the piece of ground he had long before give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to friends for a burying-place, situate at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow∣er end of his orchard, at <HI>Siddington,</HI> near <HI>Cirences<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI></P>
<P>Some days after his interment, I had the news that my brother and myself, with four friends more, were discharged by the judge; but that the other four were detained for their fees. I there∣fore went down to use my interest for their dis∣charge. I found him ill in bed; and he told me he was very willing to remit the fees belonging to himself; but there was some due to the under∣sheriff, and those were not in his power. But soon after providence so ordered that we all had our liberty; and I came and settled at my present habitation at <HI>Chesham,</HI> in <HI>Buckinghamshire,</HI> where I have now dwelt about forty years.</P>
<P>Thus, considering that it were great pity those singular providences of the Almighty should not be recorded, for the benefit of posterity, I was willing for my own perusal and that of my family, and some few particular friends, to commit them to writing. In the doing of which, respecting the several conferences my father had with the bishops, and others, before-mention'd, I have been careful to pen them down in the same words they were then express'd in, as near as I could re∣collect, or at least to retain the genuin sense and purport of them. Which, reader, if they tend to thy confirmation and encouragement in a course of true christian piety, I have my end; who am</P>
