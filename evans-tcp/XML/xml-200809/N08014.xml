<BIBL>PSAL. XXX. 11, 12.</BIBL>
<Q>Thou hast turned for me my mourning into danc∣ing: Thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness: To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent; O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee forever.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS is a psalm or song of praise to God, composed (as the title of the psalm expres∣ses it) by David at the dedication of his house: But the psalm is taken up in the recounting the troubles and fears, difficulties and dangers he had been in; and the merciful inter∣position of divine providence for his deliverance out of them. And if we would have our hearts truly and thoro'ly affected with divine goodness, and our lips opened wide in devout praises to God, we must look back to the troubles, the fears, the dangers and distresses we have been in, and from which God has delivered us: For the greatness of a mercy is according to the degree
<PB N="8" REF="010230_0005_0F7DB59BF23D4848"/>
of evil, misery or calamity we are delivered from. — This was the way by which the psalmist's soul was elevated in high devotion, his heart inlarged in gratitude, and his lips opened wide in praise to God. — It should seem he had not only been under great difficulties and hazards, by his ene∣mies, and by the hand of Saul, who from envy and jealousy sought his life; but that he had been brought low, and upon the borders of the grave by sickness: But he cried unto the Lord, and he heard him, and kept him alive that he should not go down into the pit; and he praises God, that his anger endured for so little a while, but for a moment, and then visited with his favour which is life: <HI>weeping endured for a night; but joy came in the morning,</HI> 5th v. of the context. In the verses of our text he observes, how won∣derful the loving kindness of God had been to him in this respect; that he had scattered the clouds, changed the dark and gloomy scenes that had been before him, and had opened such new scenes of joy and gladness as called for the most enlarged gratitude and exalted praises. — <HI>Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing:</HI> He went mourning because of the enemy and the oppressor, and was full of mourn∣ing because of his sickness, and the threatnings of death: But now his mourning was turned into dancing, his spirits were relieved of the heavy burthen that lay upon them: and he felt such a lightness and chearfulness within upon his
<PB N="9" REF="010230_0006_0F7DB59FA0161898"/>
deliverance, as inclined him to dancing and such like tokens of joy. <HI>Thou hast put off my sack∣cloth:</HI> In times of trouble, and when under the mighty hand of God, by some sore judgment or threatning evil, they were wont in token of hu∣mility to put on sackcloth. Thus we find David and all the elders of Israel, in the time of the Lord's anger, and when threatned with destruc∣tion, clothed with sackcloth. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. 21. 16.</NOTE> But now God had put off his sackcloth, had redressed his grie∣vances, and removed his grounds of fear. <HI>And girded me with gladness,</HI> That is, so delivered him, so relieved and revived his spirit, as not only gave him peace and calmness of mind, but caused great joy and gladness of heart to him. <HI>He girded</HI> him with gladness. He compassed him about with gladness as with a girdle on every side. His soul was filled with joy: and gladness appeared all about him, in his countenance, in his speech, and in his whole behaviour. His troubles were removed, his burthens were taken off, his fears all vanished, and so he was all joy and gladness. <HI>To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent.</HI> That is, that his tongue might speak and sing the praises of God, and not suffer such mercies to pass in silence and without a due acknowledgment of them. God delivered him from all his troubles, and from all that was his fear, and girded him with gladness, with this view that David might see
<PB N="10" REF="010230_0007_0F7DB5A0747C8DD0"/>
the power and goodness of God herein and ce∣lebrate his praises. <HI>O Lord my God I will give thanks unto thee forever.</HI> He had such a sense of the divine goodness, while he was thus girded with gladness, that he was not only for singing and speaking forth the praises of God for the present; but was for maintaining an abiding sense hereof upon his heart, so as should be an inexhaustible fund for everlasting praise. The psalmist had such a strong and lively sense of the salvations and deliverances he had of late receiv∣ed, that it seemed to him that he should never forget the same: But that the remembrance hereof would be so fresh and strong upon his mind, that he should feel an heart, and find a tongue to celebrate his praises forever, and ever.</P>
<P>The words thus largely opened afford us the following observations, which I hope will appear seasonable for our present meditation on the great and glorious occasion of our being this day together in the house of God. —</P>
<P N="1">1 OBS. <HI>The great God has the absolute go∣vernment of our affairs and circumstances in the world, and opens the various scenes of life to us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 OBS. <HI>It is the will of God, and what he has in view, when he changes the scene in favour of his people, that they should not be silent, but should awake their glory to speak and sing his praise.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="11" REF="010230_0008_0F7DB5A13AF1D800"/>3 OBS. <HI>The true People of God desire to keep such a constant sense of the divine goodness as to be disposed to praise his name forever.</HI></P>
<P N="4">1 OBS. <HI>The great God has the absolute go∣vernment of our affairs and circumstances in the world, and opens the various scenes of life to us.</HI></P>
<P>This is what we are taught in the text, and which is acknowledged to his glory. David passed thro' very various scenes of life, sometimes he was mourning in sackcloth: and then he was girded with gladness; both which he ascribes to God. <HI>Thou</HI> hidest thy face and I was troubled, 7th v. <HI>Thou</HI> hast also girded me with gladness, as in the text. And this is a glorious character which God assumes to himself. <HI>I even I am He and there is no God with me; I kill, and I make alive, I wound, and I heal, neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 32 39</NOTE>. I form the light and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah 45. 7.</NOTE>.—</P>
<P>Here let me say,</P>
<P>1st. <HI>Whatever sorrowful, afflicted or threatning circumstances we are at any time under, it is by the over-ruling providence of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Shall there be any evil in the city,</HI> that is evil of affliction, <HI>and the Lord hath not done it</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Amos. 3 0.</NOTE> Some∣times we are afflicted with bodily pains and sick∣ness. "He is chastned with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain;
<PB N="12" REF="010230_0009_0F7DB5A2B7EB6248"/>
his soul draweth near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers" <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job 23. 19 22.</NOTE>. And he is ready to say with Hezekiah when threatned with death by reason of the disease that was upon him, "I said in the cutting off my days I shall go to the gates of the grave: I shall not see the Lord in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world: He will cut me off with pining sickness" <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah 38. 10, 11, 12.</NOTE>. Sometimes God reduces to straits, poverty and famine: Some∣times he deprives of the dearest friends and rela∣tives, and with them takes away the most va∣luable enjoyments and the sweetest comforts of life, and gives them to complain with the psal∣mist, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">88 Psalm 18.</NOTE> "Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness." Sometimes God hides the light of his counte∣nance and they are troubled: and while they suffer God's terrors they are even distracted. Some∣times God so over-rules or permits it to be, that a people's rights and privileges are invaded, and infringed, they are greatly oppressed, and bro't into slavery, or are under the fearful appre∣hension of it. How did God over-rule as to his people Israel, that they should be so many years in the land of Egypt, and in the house of bon∣dage! And how often did God afterwards, when settled in their own land, for their sinful de∣partures from him, sell them into the hands of their enemies, who cruelly oppressed them!
<PB N="13" REF="010230_0010_0F7DB5A37220CB50"/>
Sometimes such a severe hand was kept over them by those who had them in subjection, that they were not allowed, so much as a blacksmith in all Israel, lest they should make swords and spears, or any such weapons of defence, nor so much as their husbandry tools <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Sam 13. 19.</NOTE>. Or if a peo∣ple are not actually brought into such a bondage as this; yet any approaches towards, or threat∣ning such infringements, may well cause grief and fear, sorrow and mourning, in token of which they were wont in ancient time to put on sack∣cloth. Thus Mordecai clothed himself with sackcloth when that cruel edict of Ahasuerus came out against the Jews. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph 4 2, 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>And what a sorrowful, disturbed and tumul∣tuous state have all the British colonies of Ame∣rica been in, when by a late parliamentary act, many of the privileges and liberties we had been in the quiet possession of, were cut short: and should the act have continued, we should not have been the free people that once we were, and should have been subject to such oppressions as our fathers knew nothing of; and which neither we nor our children would have been able to bear.</P>
<P>2dly. <HI>Whenever the dark scene is changed, and a more agreable one opens to us; it is God that does it for us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thou</HI> hast turned for me, my mourning into dancing. <HI>Thou</HI> hast put off my sackcloth, and
<PB N="14" REF="010230_0011_0F7DB5A72BAECCE0"/>
girded me with gladness. That is, the great God changes the scene, and gives us occasion for joy and gladness, and leads us to all the natural outward expressions thereof.</P>
<P>Joy and sorrow are human passions, and one or the other is excited, according to the different scenes God in his providence opens to us. Af∣flictions and fears, of themselves, beget sorrow and mourning: But the removal of real afflic∣tions, scattering our fears, and putting us into agreable circumstances, begets a joy and gladness of heart. And this joy is excited more or less according or in proportion to the occasion. If it be a sore calamity, and a very grievous burden we are delivered from, or if it be at such a cri∣tical season when the danger is imminent and very threatning, and our fears run high; remov∣ing such a calamity, and scattering such fears as are gathering into distress and horror, creates so much the greater joy and gladness: And some∣times the trouble, or the fear is so great and pressing upon the mind, that the sudden removal of the same excites a joy and gladness beyond what we can express: The salvation may be so great, and so sensibly affect the mind, that men of strong passions, are sometimes thrown into rapturous extacies of joy.—There is a joy un∣speakable and full of glory.</P>
<P>And how is God now turning our mourning into dancing, putting off our sackcloth and gird∣ing us with gladness, by the joyful and well
<PB N="15" REF="010230_0012_0F7DB5A79B902318"/>
attested news from that far, but mother country, which assures us that the grievous and bitter ACT which put us into mourning, covered us with sackcloth, and threw us all into confusion, is now REPEALED, <HI>totally repealed,</HI> made null and void, by the KING, LORDS, and COMMONS, in parliament assembled; so as to be as if it had never been!</P>
<P>Oh! with what joy and gladness does it gird every true-born Englishman, every friend to liberty, and every true lover of his country, his mother country or these British colonies! what joy does now fill every breast, what gladness appears in every face and feature! and how does every one feel himself ready to burst forth in loud acclamations of joy!</P>
<P>But to exhilerate your spirits, and excite your joys in a rational manner, and as becomes men of thought and judgment; who would always govern this very passion of the soul by solid and substantial reason; I say, in order to this, let us only consider the deplorable con∣dition the nation and all these colonies must have been in; if the government at home had established the ACT, and proceeded to the inforcement of the same. If these had been the heavy tidings from home, that the parliament insisted upon the rigorous execution of this <HI>act</HI> in all the American plantations, and that in order to it <HI>fleets</HI> were forming, <HI>forces</HI> raising, and a grand armament preparing, to inforce obedience
<PB N="16" REF="010230_0013_0F7DB5A855F72F28"/>
to the ACT. I say if these had been the dole∣ful tidings, Oh what grief, what fear, what con∣sternation, and confusion, should we have been put into! what anger and wrath, what re∣solution, what opposition, what force, what vio∣lence would this irritated people have gone into! what desolation, what slaughter, and blood∣shed might have been expected! — And what an unspeakable hurt must it have brought upon us, and upon our mother country! what an alienation of affection, what an interruption of mutual trade and commerce destructive to them as well as to us!</P>
<P>Moreover, How would they and we be ex∣posed to our watchful and perfidious enemies, who would suddenly and eagerly have catch'd at such a favourable opportunity to make reprisals upon us! —</P>
<P>Surely when we consider the very extensive as well as pernicious influence of this ACT, how deeply it would affect the nation as well as the colonies: and what contention and ill blood, yea, what violence, and shedding of blood, what destruction, and desolation is happily prevented by the repeal of this act: Every one who loves his neighbour, who is concerned for the public peace and safety, or that has any humanity, or bowels of compassion, must be glad and rejoice at this merciful deliverance.</P>
<P>But then by the repeal of this oppressive act, there is a positive good accruing, that may serve
<PB N="17" REF="010230_0014_0F7DB5A8B5F17A90"/>
further to excite the joy, and increase the gladness of our hearts. This serves to indear the KING (if possible) yet more and more to us, and fill us with gratitude as well as loyalty to him, and to his royal house, and will induce this people with all freedom to sacrifice their very lives and fortunes for the support and defence of his crown and dignity.</P>
<P>This also will maintain within us a just ho∣nor for, and dutiful regard to the British parlia∣ment, as the supreme legislative power of the nation, who heard our cause and redressed our grievances.</P>
<P>This also will fix upon our hearts a most grate∣ful remembrance of those wise and worthy pa∣triots, who heartily espoused and so strenuously pleaded our cause, and set things in so clear and convincing a light, as to procure the repeal of such a disagreable and destructive act. These great and good men, I say, who have exerted themselves according to their superior abilities, and their inviolable attachment to justice, truth and liberty in our behalf, will be remembred with honor, love and gratitude, and their memory blessed we hope in future generations.</P>
<P>Moreover, by reason of this happy repeal, love and affection between the mother country and us, will return with its wonted ardor: Com∣merce and trade will be carried on with the for∣mer freedom, to the mutual advantage of both them and us. And we shall be ready upon every
<PB N="18" REF="010230_0015_0F7DB5A9803D1C88"/>
occasion to strengthen one another's hands for mutual safety against the common enemy. And it gives the most pleasing prospect of the growing greatness of the British empire. So that all who love the peace and prosperity of the nation and all its dependencies; and are pleased to see so sweet and pleasant a thing as brethren dwelling together in unity and love; must needs rejoice and be exceeding glad at this happy turn of times, as one of the most distinguishing and ex∣tensive blessings of an outward nature that we ever received.</P>
<P N="2">2 OBS. <HI>It is the will of God, and what he has in view, when he changes the scene in favour of his people, that they should not be silent; but should awake their glory to speak and sing his praise.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent.</HI> The great God will have us not only glad and joyful for any agreable and happy turn of affairs; but would have us also thankful. Many people are glad at the good news, and agreable change of affairs; but not thankful. They feel a pleasing sensation within; but no due sense of God, or religious acknow∣ledgment of him. Whereas, this is what God expects and requires of us as men, and christians. <HI>He girds me with gladness, to the end that my glory may sing praise to him, and not be silent.</HI></P>
<P>By the psalmist's glory some understand his <HI>soul,</HI> his rational and intellective powers, which
<PB N="19" REF="010230_0016_0F7DB5AA366A2148"/>
are indeed the glory of the man. But others un∣derstand it rather of his <HI>tongue,</HI> as <HI>singing</HI> and <HI>not keeping silence</HI> mentioned in the text are appropriate to the tongue.</P>
<P>Let us take them together; reason, religion and speech are the distinguishing glory of man above every creature upon the footstool: and this glory taking it collectively, is not to be <HI>silent</HI> when we receive any signal favours from God; but to shew forth his praise. <HI>Reason</HI> is to con∣sider the greatness of benefits received, with all the great and happy consequences thereof. <HI>Re∣ligion</HI> is to view the great God as the author, and giver of every good thing, and to observe the great and the undeserved goodness of God, in all the merciful and powerful interpositions of his providence; and the tongue is to speak and sing, and thereby to shew forth the praises of God.</P>
<P>And who will suffer his glory to be silent? who can refrain from meditating upon the great and wonderful things God has done for us, and from having his heart enlarged in thankfulness, and his mouth filled with praises? Surely reason, and religion, and the tongue, should all awake upon this great and joyful occasion, and not be silent.</P>
<P>We should set our <HI>reason</HI> to work, and consi∣der the greatness, extensiveness, and vast impor∣tance of the affair for which we are at this time celebrating the praises of God.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="010230_0017_0F7DB5AB12E259C0"/>The <HI>Stamp Act</HI> was very extensive, not only as to the vast variety of articles contained in it; but as to those who were subjected to it, and would be very much affected by it. It extended to all the British subjects in America, from Ca∣nada to Florida, comprehending all the British Islands. Moreover, our reason and judgment tells us, that it greatly affected Great-Britain itself in all its merchandize and manufacture: and in∣deed that the whole British empire would have felt the ill-influence of it: and consequently that the repeal of this act has relieved a multitude of people, and filled many thousands and millions with joy. For reason tells us this is the most effectual method of preventing any grievous breach between the mother country, and these her colonies; and of preserving the peace, love, and happy harmony that have so long subsisted between us; and of establishing the power, wealth and prosperity of all. And so in short reason tells us, that this is one of the greatest affairs, as to its influence and consequences, that has been transacted in the nation for many ages. I believe it will be readily yielded, that there has scarcely been one thing of so great importance to the British nation and colonies, since the <HI>happy revolution</HI> near fourscore years ago, by King William of glorious memory; as the total repeal of the stamp act.</P>
<P>Now let religion speak, and let us set ourselves to consider that divine power and influence by <PB N="21" REF="010230_0018_0F7DB5ABD4C9EE10"/>which this happy repeal has been effected.— Religion teaches us to view the hand of God in every thing. Religion teaches us that by the di∣vine permission that oppressive act was pass'd, by which God hid his face from us, testified his anger, and let us see what our sins deserved: and that it is of his undeserved mercy, and thro' his all governing influence, that it is now repealed.</P>
<P>We may see, and we ought to observe, so far as we can, the natural means by which things are brought about; but we must look above and beyond all human means and natural causes, to him <HI>who sitteth upon the circle of the earth,</HI> and who guides and governs in universal nature.</P>
<P>We may see, and we ought with gratitude to observe, the wisdom, the sagacity, the faithfulness, the indefatigableness of our generous friends in espousing and solliciting our cause; and we may see the various arguments made use of, and the happy influence they had upon the King, and Parliament: But we must look thro' all these to the great Governor of the world, who has the hearts of Kings, and of all men in his own hands, to change and turn them even as the rivers of water are turned: and so religion sees the hand of God in bringing about this repeal. And the good christian will trace the foot-steps of divine providence, so far as is plain and obvious, and where it is beyond his penetration, he will con∣sider it as the work of the Lord, and regard it as the operation of his hands. Thus the chris∣tian
<PB N="22" REF="010230_0019_0F7DB5AC71AA08F8"/>
observes the hand of God in that general commotion stirred up in the nation when the act was first passed, and the time of its taking place appointed. The providence of God is also to be seen in the universal uneasiness and clamour in all the colonies upon the first tidings of it, all as one man rising up in opposition to it; such a union as was never before seen in all the colonies.</P>
<P>Moreover, God is to be seen in the change of the ministry at such a critical and important season, and calling such eminently worthy patri∣ots into the administration, who saw the dread∣ful consequences of inforcing the stamp act, and were (as we understand) to a man for the repeal∣ing it. And how visible is the hand of God in raising up such wise, able and faithful friends and advocates to sollicit the repeal, and in filling their mouths with such clear, strong and cogent argu∣ments, to convince and perswade of the absolute necessity of a total repeal. Such as the Duke of Graston, Marquiss of Rockingham, Lord Dartmouth, Lord Camden, General Conway, the right Honorable William Dowdeswell, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Sir William Meredith, Sir George Saville, Col. Barre, great and worthy patriots, whom God has raised up and honoured as eminent instruments of our deliverance. And how visible is the hand of God, more especially with respect to the great, the good, and the excellent Mr. Pitt, that grand <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of true virtue, and of English liberty,
<PB N="23" REF="010230_0020_0F7DB5AF5B5DCC60"/>
and whom God has once, and again raised up to be the deliverer of these British colonies from captivity, and slavery. I say, how remarkable was the kind hand of providence, that notwith∣standing his chronical grievous malady of body, his soul was inspired with such a sacred ardor for his country's safety; that he surmounted all the difficulties of bodily pain and weakness; and appeared in that august assembly with all his flannels, and was enabled to utter himself with such clearness, closeness, plainness and faithfulness as carried conviction with it, and had its desired effect. Religion teaches us that the great God made so great a man; formed and fitted him for such eminent services, and used and honored him as such a public Saviour to the British Israel.</P>
<P>Moreover, Religion teaches us to see the great God standing in the congregation of the mighty, and judging among the Gods, presiding both in the house of Commons, and in the house of Lords, exciting their attention to the weighty reasonings, and causing them to feel such force and energy therein, as to change their mind, and be inclined to repeal what they so lately enacted, being convinced this was the best, if not the only way to save the nation and its colonies from ruin. Now that majority of Parliament is to be highly honored, for their regard to the public good, that they no sooner saw the dangerous tendency of their late act, but they speedily made it null and void. But as we would ho∣nor
<PB N="24" REF="010230_0021_0F7DB5B00C7F2C48"/>
and respect every man, that has given his hand or voice for the public safety; so we would see the hand of God in all this remarkable event, from the beginning to the end. For religion will not allow us to attribute any thing to meer chance, but points out the hand of God in the most casual events. In what is there more chance than in votes, and lots? But what says the wise man? Prov. 16. 33. <HI>The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole determination is of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Well now, when reason and religion teach us these things, what is the tongue, that glory of men to do upon it? Why, be sure, not to be <HI>silent,</HI> but to awake and talk of all his wondrous works, to sing unto him, and to give praise.</P>
<P>And who will, or who can suffer his glory to be silent, or refrain from shewing forth the praises of God for this remarkable glorious instance of his goodness and mercy? O! how should our lips be opened in the most exalted praises of God, and say he is our God and we will praise him, our father's God and we will prepare him an habitation, who has remembred us in our low estate, and in the critical hour gave the vote for us! What praises are due to almighty God from this people? that he gave us favour in the eyes of the King and of his Ministry, and of his Lords and of his Commons, who have redressed our grievances, and taken away the heavy yoke, that neither we nor our children would have been able to bear; whereby he has
<PB N="25" REF="010230_0022_0F7DB5B040AFB860"/>
relieved our distressed minds, removed the gloom that hung upon every face, turned our mourning into dancing, put off our sackcloth, and girded us with gladness. Oh! how then should we <HI>praise him with joyful lips, and shew forth his praise from day to day? I will bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall continually be in my mouth. My soul shall make her boast in the Lord, the humble shall hear thereof, and shall be glad. 0! magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together, and say, bless the Lord O our souls, and forget not all his benefits: Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowler, the snare is broken, and we are escaped; our help is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth.</HI></P>
<P>But then we must employ our tongue, our glory, not only to speak but to sing his praises. This is the language of gratitude and true devo∣tion, <HI>O come let us sing unto the Lord, let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover we find in Ezra's day <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek 3. 11.</NOTE>, that the peo∣ple in praising the Lord shouted with a great shout. <HI>Be glad then in the Lord, and rejoice ye righteous, and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 OBS. <HI>The true people of God desire to keep up such a constant sense of divine goodness, as to be always disposed to praise his name, and to give thanks to him forever.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="010230_0023_0F7DB5B0F6EDFB30"/><HI>O Lord my God! I will give thanks unto thee forever.</HI> A truly grateful people will not content themselvcs with a few thankful acknowledgments, or in attending the public worship of God in a way of praise and thanksgiving for an hour or two, or in bonfires and illuminations the evening after; but will labour to retain a grateful sense of divine favours all their life long, and to transmit the memory of God's great goodness to future generations. This will be the care of a godly and a grateful people, not to forget any of God's benefits; especially such as are public, remarka∣ble and very important; but to preserve the me∣mory of them from generation to generation. <HI>We will not hide them from their children, shew∣ing to the generations to come the praises of the Lord, and his strength and his wonderful works which he hath done; that the generations to come might know them, even the children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to their children, that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. 78. 4. 6. 7.</NOTE>.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the grateful and the gracious soul will be for giving thanks to God forever in this world, as he will endeavour that one genera∣tion shall praise his works to another, and declare his mighty acts. But then the pious thankful soul will praise this God forever and ever, in the other world, where all the wonders of divine
<PB N="27" REF="010230_0024_0F7DB5B1F1553A08"/>
goodness, and all his seasonable appearances for his church and people will so open themselves to the saints, as to fill them with new matter of admiration and praise to all eternity.</P>
<P>How careful should we then be to perpe∣tuate the memory of this late signal deliverance: and endeavour that God may be praised forever and ever upon the account hereof: and when we are sleeping in the dust of <HI>death</HI> which can∣not praise God, and in the <HI>grave</HI> which cannot celebrate him; our children may rise up and praise him; and so from generation to generation. And we wish to God there may be such lasting, happy and blessed effects of this repeal, as to our religious as well as civil interests, as that we and our children may have occasion for rendering everlasting praises to God in heaven. And if the repeal of this act should be the means of con∣tinuing our religious as well as civil liberties, and of transmitting pure and undefiled religion to future ages: Oh! what a resource will it be of perpetual and everlasting praises!</P>
<P>But then, as we are to keep up a grateful per∣petual remembrance of God's great mercy to us, that so we might praise him forever and ever; so it becomes us to keep up a continued grateful re∣membrance of those worthy honorable patriots whom God has made eminent instruments of good unto us. Ingratitude to friends and bene∣factors is to be abhorred: and if we would not be ungrateful we may not be forgetful of such
<PB N="28" REF="010230_0025_0F7DB5B271AEEEE0"/>
who have been distinguishingly kind, and good to us: But must endeavour to perpetuate their names with honor: that they who rise up after them, and us, may call them blessed. The me∣mory of the just is blessed: and the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. And it is highly just and reasonable, that they who have received special benefits from the great and the good, should do their part that the memory of such may be blessed.</P>
<P>And as God has in this late dark day, and cri∣tical juncture, raised up powerful friends, and worthy benefactors to us, who by their wisdom and zeal, their courage, constancy and close ap∣plication in our behalf, have procured this glo∣rious deliverance for us; surely we can do no less than call them blessed, by wishing blessings of every kind to them and theirs: and not only so, but should endeavor that the memory of their good deeds may be handed down with ho∣nor, not only in the annals of time and history of the present age; but by some lasting monu∣ment or other.</P>
<P>And if it was in our power, how agreable would it be to have the glorious Mr. Pitt, and others of the fore-mentioned Worthies, who are avowed enemies of corruption, tyranny and op∣pression, who are the fast friends of virtue, and powerful advocates for liberty; at the same time lovers of their King, their nation, and all the colonies: I say, how agreable would it be to
<PB N="29" REF="010230_0026_0F7DB5B5EB23CAF0"/>
have brazen or marble monuments erected, not only to perpetuate their memory; but to let the future ages see the truly grateful sense we had of their patriotic goodness in the time of it? I don't mean idolatrous images, to fall down and wor∣ship, which was the superstition and folly of the ancient heathen, with respect to their heroes; but to present to future ages the resemblances of such whom God formed, raised up, and made such eminent instruments of saving the British Empire from impending ruin.</P>
<P>All that I have further to add here is, that in our praises and thanksgivings to God for this present merciful deliverance, we join our humble servent prayers that this our tranquility may be lengthened out to future generations; and that; this people may never more be molested in such a manner: But that we and ours may be conti∣nued in the quiet possession of all our constituti∣onal rights from age to age. And as the God of our fathers has so wonderfully appeared for us at this time, we may confidently hope and trust he will for time to come, if we walk in his ways, and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind. And indeed considering, how fully this affair was debated in parliament, and the judgment of some eminently learned in the law, of both houses of parliament relative to constitutional right, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears by the public prints, that Lord Camden in the house of Lords. and Mr. Pitt in the house of Commons, declared the Stamp Act to be unconstitutional.</NOTE> and taking many other
<PB N="30" REF="010230_0027_0F7DB5B696571208"/>
things into consideration, we have no ground to fear any thing of this sort, so long as we approve ourselves loyal subjects of king George, and his successors in the British throne; and yield all due subjection to the British Parliament.</P>
<P>And, as the Jews of old, when they were de∣livered from the cruel edict of the king for their destruction, were filled with gladness and praise, and kept up an anniversary solemnity in joyful remembrance of their deliverance, which was a <HI>day of gladness and feasting, a good day, and of sending portions one to another</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 19.</NOTE>. So now since this parliamentary edict which alarmed all our fears, and filled us with distress, is absolutely and entirely repealed; let every one be girded with gladness, and every tongue sing praise to God.</P>
<P>And as this religious exercise will be followed with public rejoicings, and external tokens of joy; let me earnestly exhort you all, both old and young, high and low, to conduct with all that decency &amp; due decorum, which becomes those who have been in the house of God this day, pouring out our devout religious acknowledgments before him; and attending upon the counsels of his word. Let me intreat you, and in the name and fear of God, let me charge you in all your mirth to refrain from every thing that is <HI>profane;</HI> from every thing that is <HI>rude</HI> or <HI>unseemly;</HI> from every thing that is <HI>intemperate</HI> and contrary to the rules of sobriety; and from every thing that
<PB N="31" REF="010230_0028_0F7DB5B6FAE35528"/>
is <HI>mischievous</HI> or hurtful to the persons or pro∣perties of others.</P>
<P>And let me further caution you against ma∣naging your rejoicing in a way of triumph or insult upon any persons at home (for I know of none among ourselves) who have appeared zea∣lous promoters of the act which is now abolish∣ed. And that you avoid every thing that is ir∣rirating or provoking to mens spirits; or that tends to beget ill-will: For we know of no man, but whose help and good-will we may sometime or other have occasion for. Finally here let me advise you to break up your diversions in good season, and return every one quietly to his place of abode: And may every thing be conducted with so good order, and with such innocency of behaviour as becomes the disciples of Christ, who joy in the Lord, and when they greatly rejoice, it is in the God of their salvation. And if these external rejoicings flow from, or are accompanied with true gratitude to the God of heaven, who has appeared for our help, it will be a token of farther good.</P>
<P>Let me add one word more and have done; and that is, that we <HI>pay all due respect to the civil magistrate,</HI> and a willing subjection to the government over us, whether supreme or subor∣dinate. Let us consider the true design of go∣vernment, which is the <HI>good of the community;</HI> and fixing this in our mind as a firm principle, it will serve very much to direct, and regulate as
<PB N="32" REF="010230_0029_0F7DB5B7B2A65AB8" MS="y"/>
to all exertions of power, as well as to our obe∣dience and submission thereunto. I shall re∣commend to you the apostolic advice, 1 Pet. 2. 13— 17. <HI>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake,</HI> that is, to every consti∣tutional ordinance of man that is not repugnant to the superior law of God and nature; <HI>whether it be to the King as supreme, or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him, for the punish∣ment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well: For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness; but as the servants of God. Honor all men, love the brotherhood; fear God and honor the King,</HI> PRAYING <HI>al∣ways for Kings, and for all in authority, and that you yourselves may lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godliness and honesty.</HI></P>
<P>And now blessed be the Lord who hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad: Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who <HI>only</HI> doth wondrous things, and blessed be his glori∣ous name forever; and let the whole earth be filled with his glory. AMEN, and AMEN.</P>
