<BIBL>Tit. 3. 1, 2, 8.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Put them in mind,</HI>—<HI>to be ready to every good work, To speak evil of no Man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</HI>—<HI>These Things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God, be careful to maintain good works.</HI></Q>

<Q><HI>Add to Godliness, Brotherly Kind∣ness &amp; Charity:—If ye do these Things, ye shall never fall.</HI>—<HI>Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.</HI></Q>

<Q><HI>Put on</HI>—<HI>Kindness</HI>—.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ONE Incomparable Excellency of the Gos∣pel-Institution, and an unexceptionable Argument of the Divine Original and Authority of it, is the noble System of Practical Duties and Moral Ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es, which it affords us. For therein the <HI>Agenda,</HI> or matters of Practice, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well as the <HI>Credenda,</HI> or matters of Faith,) are more exactly stated, more perspicuously discover'd, and wisely elevated to a greater height of Purity and Perfection, than in any other Religion in the World. The Gospel of Christ is a most <HI>perfect Law of Liberty,</HI> a complet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, universal and unerring Directory, comprizing our entire Duty; fully supplying the defects of the <HI>Jewish</HI> AEconomy, and infallibly correcting the Errors of the <HI>Gentile</HI> Philoso∣phy. Very just and true are those observations of the <HI>Psalmist, That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ and the Com∣mandment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ding broad.</HI> For it reaches to the whole

Man in all it's Powers, &amp; to our whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehaviour in all Cases and Capacities. It prescribes our Duty towards God and towards Man, towards our Selves and towards Others, and that in its just latitude and genuine extent, without ri∣gour, mistake, or deficiency.—Particularly, it gives us the most perfect Canons for the government of our Conduct towards our <HI>Neighbour:</HI> and among the many other Branches of our Duty towards others, which it invites and obliges us to the observation of, That too unfashionable vertue of <HI>Brotherly Kindness</HI> is none of the least considerable. With Injunctions and Directions whereunto the Gospel so <HI>abounds,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t it may well be styled, <HI>The Law of Kindness, The royal Law of Love.</HI>—As in a multitude of other Places, so particularly in our <HI>Text,</HI> we are call'd upon to come into the practice of this excellent Virtue. <HI>The Exhortation speaks to us on this wise,</HI>—PUT ON KINDNESS.—These are the Words of inspired <HI>Paul,</HI> the great Doctor of the Gentiles, and come armed with the Majesty and Autho∣rity of <HI>the Prince of Peace,</HI> in whose Name they were delivered; which consideration bespeaks our attentive Regards unto them. And I am apt to think, the Meditation is not unseasonable.—I shall not detain you with a need∣less <HI>Analysis</HI> of the Context: but will immediately ap∣ply my self to consider the words, as they lie before us, under an abstracted view. Our Text needs little Explana∣tion.—The Original Word here rendred <HI>Kindness,</HI> is elsewhere variously translated, <HI>Goodness, Grace, Gen∣tleness, Easiness, Courteousness, Bounty,</HI> &amp;c. It gene∣rally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies that Habit or Principle, whereby we are inclined and study to accommodate our selves and become <Q>sweet and pleasant, or useful &amp; profitable unto others; whereby we desire to deserve well of all, and endea∣vour to succour one another in all offices of benignity.</Q> The Phrase—<HI>Put on</HI>—is Metaphorical, alluding most commonly to <HI>the putting on a Garment.</HI> Hence, Bro∣therly Kindness (the Thing to be <HI>put on</HI>) is here resem∣bled to a <HI>Vesture;</HI> and that not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ptly, as might easily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shown. As for instance; <HI>Garments are for Necessity
<PB N="3" REF="002118_0004_0FBB936ADC090080"/>
and Safety, for Strength, Comfort, and Conveni∣ency:</HI> Even so of the same Importance, Service and Con∣sequence is Christian Kindness. This <HI>Spiritual Ar∣mour,</HI> This <HI>Coat of Maile</HI> is of such Behoof and Ne∣cessity, that if we are found <HI>Naked</HI> &amp; <HI>Uncloathed upon,</HI> we lie open and exposed to innumerable Evils and Perils: and have nothing to screen us from the strokes of God's vindictive Wrath, and want that which tends to protect us against, and help us to bear up under, the Blows of Man's Malice: and this as <HI>a Girdle about our Loins,</HI> will strengthen, steddy, warm and accommodate us very much in attending the Services and discharging the Duties of our several Stations and Relations.—Again, <HI>Gar∣ments are for Distinction of Persons.</HI> Men are, or shou'd be, distinguished from one another by their Habit or Cloathing, agreeable to their various Ranks and Con∣ditions in the World. It is allow'd, that Persons of Quality, the Great and Rich, such as <HI>dwell in King's Hou∣ses</HI> be dignify'd and distinguish'd by wearing of <HI>Soft Raiment and Costly Apparel!</HI> But for Inferiours to appear above their Order and Place, and to affect an Equality to Superiours, (the Page to go like his Master,) this threatens Consumption &amp; Confusion to a Common-Wealth, and is an Enormity not to be tolerated by any wise and just Government.—This is another Pro∣perty, wherein the Virtue under consideration may be compared to a Garment. Brotherly Kindness is what God wou'd have Believers to distinguish themselves from others by. This is in Scripture made one distinctive Character and Badge of the Christian Profession. Thus, Joh. 13. 35. <HI>By this</HI> (saith our Blessed Saviour) <HI>shall men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye have love one to another.</HI> So, 1 Joh. 3. 10. <HI>In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the Devil: whosoever doth not love his Brother, is not of God.</HI> Brotherly Love is the very Mark, and Livery of our Lord's Family. It is one of the <HI>Criteria,</HI> whereby Believers are to ma∣nifest themselves <HI>a peculiar People, seperate from Sin∣ners.</HI> And by this Professors in the first Times of the
<PB N="4" REF="002118_0005_0FBB937187B28520"/>
Gospel signalized themselves; <Q>Hence they were called by some not <HI>Christiani,</HI> but <HI>Chrestiani,</HI> from a Greek word, (like that in our Text,) signifying their Benig∣nity and Sweetness of Disposition.</Q>—Again, <HI>Gar∣ments are for Ornament.</HI> Thus had the <HI>Holy Priest</HI> of old his Garments <HI>for beauty and glory,</HI> that He might look <HI>great</HI> in his Ministrations. Thus the <HI>King</HI> hath His <HI>Royal Apparel</HI> to shew forth the honour of His Majesty. So likewise the <HI>Bride</HI> hath her <HI>comely Attire</HI> for Ornament and Splendour.—Thus in like manner, <HI>Brotherly Kindness</HI> is none of the least <HI>Ornaments of</HI> a Christian. This is one of the <HI>Garments of Salvation,</HI> the <HI>White Raiment</HI> of the Saints, and is to them as the Princely Robes, the Priestly Vestments, and the Wedding-Garments. 'Tis part of the <HI>King's Daughters</HI> Apparel, whose <HI>Cloathing is of wrought Gold, and her Raiment of Needle Work,</HI> very curious and costly, truly rich and highly valuable, clean and bright; and of a sweet smell, <HI>like the smell of Lebanon, like the precious oyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment upon the head, that ran down upon Aarons beard, that went down to the collar of his Garment.</HI> Brotherly Kindness puts no small lustre upon <HI>the Beau∣ties of Holiness:</HI> When Professors <HI>add to Godliness, Brotherly Kindness,</HI> This is the Church's Glory; This renders it <HI>beautiful as T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rzah, comely as Jerusalem, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun, and terrible as an Arm: with Banners.</HI>—<HI>The Ornament of a meek, quiet</HI> and kind <HI>Spirit is in the sight of God of great price.</HI> <Q>'Tis an <HI>Adorning</HI> much more excellent and valuable than <HI>Gold, Pearls,</HI> or the most <HI>costly Array,</HI> much more recommending than all the Bravery of the Daughters of Zion.</Q> Christian Charity, that <HI>Diadem of Beauty, and Ornament of Grace,</HI> is an adorning of the <HI>Soul,</HI> the more noble Part: And verily such as are invested with this <HI>Garment of Praise,</HI> even <HI>Solomon in all his Glory was not arrayed like one of these.</HI> This is the great Beauty of our Profession; 'tis an <HI>Eternal Excellency; the Excellency of Dignity;</HI> and such as are destitute of it are truly <HI>cloathed with Rags and
<PB N="5" REF="002118_0006_0FBB9372E88FF8E0"/>
Shame,</HI> altho' they may wear all the external Ensigns of Honour. These without That, are but a Reproach unto Men. <HI>Benignity</HI> and <HI>Beauty</HI> are so nearly related and inseperably wedded, that (I find) the very same word which in one place is rendred <HI>Kindness, Goodness, Mercifulness,</HI> &amp;c. is in another place rendred <HI>Goodliness, Glory,</HI> or <HI>Comeliness:</HI> which intimates no less than that Christian Kindness puts a Loveliness on the Soul, makes the <HI>Face to shine,</HI> and is truly amiable and <HI>honourable in all.</HI></P>
<P>NOW this goodly Raiment, is what the Apostle exhorts us to <HI>Put on.</HI>—<HI>Put on Kindness.</HI>—The Phrase t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls us, that this Virtue is <HI>Preternatural:</HI> not a <HI>native</HI> Adjunct, but an <HI>additional</HI> foreign Quality. By the Fall we were stript of this Spiritual Garment, and we come naked into the World. A Man may with as much propriety and truth be said to be born <HI>dresst,</HI> with his Cloaths on his Back, as endued with a true Principle of <HI>Charity</HI> in his Heart. 'Tis a Complaint of an ancient Date, and ever true of all in the state of unrenew'd nature,—<HI>Homo Homini Lupus.</HI>—Men are naturally mere Wolves, <HI>living in malice and envy, hate∣ful and hating one another.</HI> There may be▪ indeed the shadow and appearance of Love in a Wicked Man, but not the Truth and Reality.</P>
<P>AND when we are <HI>Exhorted</HI> to <HI>Put on</HI> Kindness; It may note,—That we shou'd get <HI>furnished</HI> with the Mantle of Christian Charity, provide our selves with it, Have it in a readiness and not have it to seek in time of need.—And that this shou'd be <HI>proportionable</HI> to us; answerable to our Statu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and Figure.—And that we shou'd be every one <HI>Personally</HI> cloathed with it, that we <HI>our selves</HI> learn to shew Kind∣ness, and not excuse our selves with the pretence of <HI>others</HI> Charity, any more than we shou'd be content to go naked or ragged, while others appear in rich Appa∣rel.—Again, It intimates, that we should <HI>bestir our selves</HI> and give diligence to work our Hearts into a charitable Frame; that we don't lazily and sluggishly
<PB N="6" REF="002118_0007_0FBB9374155190B8"/>
sit down and expect to be cloathed, without any endea∣vours of our own; but that we our selves be active, and essay to put on this Heavenly Temper; yet this with an humble dependence on the help of the Holy Spirit, whose Garment it is; of His preparing, and His putting on as the Supreme Agent.—We must put it on, as some close <HI>under-Garment;</HI> gird it tight and fasten it firmly about us, and not let it hang loose and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lack, which will lessen it's comliness and warmth.—We must put it on, as our <HI>ordinary Attire,</HI> which we can't do without, and which we wear every Day and all the Day long. We must put on Charity as duly as we put on our wearing Cloaths. There must be an habitual fixed disposition to it, and a persevering exercise of it. "We must always appear in it, as in our Cloathing, and never without it"; and reckon our selves undrest, to our shame, if it be off at any time.—We must put it on as <HI>Ar∣mour:</HI> We must buckle it on regularly and be covered with it entirely, as Soldiers compleatly Arm'd: and we must daily be proving our Armour, that we may grow skilful and expert in the use of it, and that it mayn't be a burden to us.—We must put it on as an <HI>Orna∣ment;</HI> with as much care and exactness as a <HI>Bride</HI> puts on her nuptial Attire; with as much Delight and Sa∣tisfaction as a <HI>Prince</HI> elect, His Crown &amp; Robes of State; and with as much Solemnity as the <HI>High Priest</HI> of old His goodly Minesterial Apparel.—In a Word, Our Charity must be <HI>visible,</HI> apparent, and <HI>shine before others,</HI> as Rich and Splendid Raiment upon us doth; and here∣by we should appear great and distinguish'd from others, as a Man by the peculiar Habit of his Office. We shou'd take a <HI>Pleasure,</HI> and a sort of holy <HI>Pride,</HI> in wearing of it, as our Glory, Honour and Praise.—Thus the <HI>Apostle</HI> in our Text calls upon Christians to put on, <HI>as the Elect of God, Holy &amp; Beloved,</HI> Kindness.</P>
<P>THE only Note or OBSERVATION I shall insist on from these Words, is This, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>

DOCT. THAT <HI>Kindness to others is one part of Practical Christianity, of indispensable Obligation upon every Professor:</HI> a <HI>Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> which all shou'd be endued with,—a <HI>Duty</HI> which all shou'd apply themselves to the Practice of.</P>
<P>IN handling of which Prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>, I shall observe this Method. (1) Explain the Nature of Kindness. (2) Show the Extent of it. (3) Our Obligations hereunto. And Finally make some brief Application.</P>
<P>I. TO shew the <HI>Nature</HI> of Christian Kindness. And here, This Vertue may be consider'd, either as Seated in the Heart, or as Exhibited in the Life, and so it implies both <HI>Benevolence</HI> and <HI>Beneficence:</HI> a bearing good▪ will unto our Neighbour, and being on all occa∣sions, obliging and officious, amicable and Serviceable unto others.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT may be consider'd <HI>as seated in the Heart:</HI> as a Grace or inward Habit; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o means that frame or temper of mind, whereby we are in all regards favoura∣bly disposed, and <HI>kindly affectioned</HI> towards others. It implies a certain Good Nature, Sweetness, Softness, Compassion, Lenity, Civility, Candour, Ingenuity, and Generosity of Spirit.—This Benignity works different∣ly according to the various Circumstances of the Object, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d extends to all it's Concerns. Thus, in Case of our Neighbours <HI>Welfare</HI> and <HI>Felicity,</HI> it will move our Joy, and create Satisfaction. Duty obliges us to <HI>Rejoyce with them that do Rejoyce,</HI> (Rom. 12. 15.) an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Charity (where it reigns in any Soul) does incline and excite hereunto. A true Spirit of <HI>Kindness</HI> is utterly incon∣sistent with prevailing <HI>Envy.</HI> Hence the Apostle sepe∣rates these Two, 1. Cor. 13. 4. <HI>Charity is kind, Charity envieth not.</HI> A Charitable kind Temper will not <HI>repine</HI> but <HI>rejoyce</HI> at the Prosperity of others, when it is for God's Glory, will be sincerely glad to see them flourish∣ing in the World, rising in their Reputation, and various

temporal Interests, reigning in Peace, Wealth &amp; Power: But especially Christian Kindness will <HI>rejoyce greatly</HI> to see Men <HI>walking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Truth,</HI> to see their <HI>Souls pros∣per;</HI> will delight it self in the growing abundance of their Spiritual Glories, Delights and Riches. <HI>Cha∣rity rejoyceth not in Iniquity: but rejoyceth in the Truth,</HI> (1 Cor. 13. 6.) Upright Christians have <HI>no greater Joy than this,</HI> 2 Epist. Joh. 4.—Further, In Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of <HI>Adversity,</HI> This Kindness will excite our affectionate Sympathy with our Neighbour; It will make us <HI>weep with them that weep,</HI> (Rom. 12. 15.) and <HI>bear the Burdens of other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> (Gal. 6. 2.) and with bleeding Bowels mourn and grieve, when Providence frowns on 'em, and blasts their Credit, Health, and Worldly Interests: But above all, it will draw forth our compassionate Regards to them under <HI>Spiritual</HI> Troubles; will make us com∣miserate impenitent Sinners under the insupportable weights of Guilt, and Fear and Misery that lie upon them; and pity the Saints under their various Griefs, and Doubts, and Cares and Infirmities, which lie as so many Loads upon them.—A truly Christian benign Spi∣rit has a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ender fellow-feeling with them under all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>grieved for the affliction of Joseph,</HI> and <HI>remembers them that are in Bonds, as bound with them, and them which suffer adversity, as Suffering with them.</HI> In a Word, It divides both Joys and Griefs. It deeply resents and shares in, both the Evil and the Good, which others meet with. 'Tis the Language of a charitable Spirit, That,—Who is strong and I am not strong? <HI>who is weak and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</HI> 2 Cor. 11. 29.—Further, In case of <HI>Injuries</HI> and <HI>Affronts</HI> receiv'd, it is slow to anger, desirous to for∣bear, and ready to forgive. We read, Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l 2. 13. <HI>The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and of great kindness.</HI> And He wou'd have us show our kind∣ness in the same manner. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 32. Be ye <HI>kind</HI> one to another, <HI>tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.</HI> And this is the Disposition of á truly Christian temper. Hence
<PB N="9" REF="002118_0010_0FBB937AC4FABFF0"/>
<HI>Kindness, Meekness, Long-Suffering,</HI> &amp;c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are in our Text joyn'd together as of near affinity. And we read, (1 Cor. 13. 4, 5, 7.) <HI>Charity suffereth long, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kind, is not easily provoked, beareth all things.</HI> It is not hasty nor severe in it's Resentments; It chains up our Passions, and will not suffer them to rise into transports of fury, and boil up to excessive heights upon every petty Displeasure, nor wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> suffer Revenge to fasten on our Thot's, or Anger to rest in our Bosoms: but makes us <HI>easy to be entreated,</HI> inclines us to <HI>long for bearing,</HI> and enables us quickly to digest an injury; knowing that <HI>'tis the discretion of a Man to defer his anger, and his glory to pass over a Transgression.</HI>—Moreover, In Case of the <HI>Infirmities</HI> of our Brethren, a Charitable Kind Spirit will dispose us to bear 'em, and conceal 'em. We are bidden to <HI>receive him that is weak in the Faith,</HI> and to <HI>bear the infirmities of the weak.</HI> And we are told, that <HI>Charity will cover the multitude of Sins;</HI> Sins of common infirmity, and grosser Sins reformed. It will excite us not only to hide them from the view of others, but also to put 'em (as much as possible) out of our own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight, to bury them in Oblivion; to excuse and make the best of them: True Charity will keep us back from evil Surmisings, rigorous Censures, and severe Criticisms on our Neighbours Conduct. It will make us candid in our Interpretation of what others say and do; applauding what is Good, and setting it off with all the advantages that the discretion of an honest heart can sug∣gest, and forbearing to aggravate what is Bad. It will make us jealous over our selves least we call <HI>Good, Evil,</HI> and <HI>Sweet, Bitter;</HI> 'twill make us cautious not from single acts to infer a rooted custom; cautious how we judge of Men's Principles and Ends in any action, and wary not to draw up any rash conclusion from inevident Symptoms, and undemonstrative Circumstances, &amp; wary not to condemn Men upon uncertain Reports, as is too much the manner of an uncharitable World; but is as criminal, as common. And it will make us take heed that we don't condemn beyond the Importance, as well

<P>THUS I've consider'd the Grace of Kindness, as 'tis <HI>seated in the Heart.</HI> In the next place,—</P>
<P N="2">2. IT may be considered, as <HI>Exhibited in our Lives.</HI> Kindness must be not only our <HI>Temper,</HI> but our <HI>Practice:</HI> and indeed the more 'tis our Temper, the more <HI>'twill be</HI> our Practice.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT must be shown in <HI>Speaking</HI> Kindly. Our Lan∣guage should express our inward Affection, and breath universal Amity. <HI>Out of the abundance of the Heart, the Mouth</HI> shou'd <HI>speak forth the words of truth and soberness,</HI> of Love and Kindness. It is part of the Cha∣racter of a Virtuous Woman, Prov. 31. 29. <HI>She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and in her tongue is the law of Kindness.</HI> The Law of Love written in the heart, shou'd influence and govern the Tongue, and dictate the most ingratiating, the most endearing Expressions. A kind Spirit will put us upon <HI>seeking out acceptable words.</HI> A <HI>soft Answer</HI> and <HI>goodly Words</HI> are the Dialect of Sin∣cere Charity.—Our Discourse for the <HI>Matter</HI> of it shou'd be under the direction and restraint of the great Law of Kindness.

'Tis for a foul-mouth'd <HI>Shimei</HI> to curse, a blasphemous <HI>Rabshakeh</HI> to revile, or a bloody <HI>Jezebel</HI> to insult and threaten. And then in our Talk <HI>of</HI> others, we must take heed le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t we at any time or in any measure incur—that foul Character the Apostle gives of some, (1 Tim. 5. 13.) <HI>Tatlers, Busy-bodies, speaking Things which they ought not.</HI> We must shun <HI>Whisper∣ing, Tale-bearing,</HI> the fuel of strife, and <HI>Backbiting,</HI> the quench-coal of Love, and common Plague of the World. When we talk of others, Let it be of <HI>the Good Things that may be found in them;</HI> which is ever the more humane and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he more honorable Part. If we <HI>give our mouth to evil, and our tongue frame deceit,</HI> we trespass upon the common Laws of Equity and Humanity, and forfeit that blessed Character of a Citizen of Zion, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s given in Psal. 15. 3. <HI>He backbiteth not with his tongue, nor taketh up a reproach against his Neighbour.</HI>—And further, as to the <HI>Manner</HI> of our speaking, It shou'd be temper'd with Goodness, and sweetned with Benig∣nity. Our Speech, both as to the Phrase and Delivery, shou'd be soft, familiar and winning. Indeed we must not wheedle and cajole, fawn and flatter, sooth and complement; <HI>having men's Persons in admiration be∣cause of advantage.</HI> Neither may we on the contrary snap and snarl, or huff and hector, nor yet flout and ridicule. 'Tis for a wicked <HI>Ishmael</HI> to scoff, a churlish <HI>Nabal</HI> to answer roughly, for the proud <HI>Babylonians</HI> to bellow as Bulls, for a treacherous <HI>Judas</HI> to speak with flattering Lips, 'tis for <HI>Children</HI> to throw dirt and squibbs in each others face, and for <HI>Madmen</HI> to cast Arrows and Firebrands at one another: and <HI>seest thou a man hasty in his words, there is more hope of a Fool than of him.</HI>—Our <HI>Speech shou'd always be with Grace, seasoned with S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt.</HI> (Eph. 4. 6.) <HI>Salt,</HI> in allusion to its <HI>uniting</HI> Quality, was among the Hebrews an usual and apt Metaphor for <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Friendship.</HI> Unto which our Saviour very plainly alludes, Mar. 9. 50.

shou'd <HI>speak Peace,</HI> and our Conversation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour of a well-disposed and good Nature. We shou'd be affable, communicative and use an honest freedom, and also be res∣pectful and courteous, avoiding all hars<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sounds, all jarring Notes, and grating Accents. 'Twas <HI>Naphtali's</HI> famous Character,—That, <HI>Gen.</HI> 49. 21. <HI>He giveth goodly words:</HI> And this must be our endeavour if we wou'd approve our selves the <HI>Peaceable in Israel.</HI> The sincere Love of the Heart should flow out at the Lips. Upon <HI>all occasions</HI> our Speech both as to matter and manner should be kind. Thus <HI>In administring Reproofs;</HI> in doing this we must not cast Stones and shoot Arrows at our Brother, nor give hard and biting Language, as the man∣ner of some is. Our Hearts should be steel'd with Cou∣rage, and yet the Admonition be temper'd with Com∣passion, which will be <HI>an excellent oyl that will not break the Head,</HI> but will tend to soften the Heart and heal the wounds of Sin. Even when the Case requires us to be somewhat warm and sanguine, and to <HI>rebuke sharply,</HI> yet, then Brotherly kindness shou'd <HI>bridle our Tongue,</HI> indite and order our Speech, so as that our Re∣bukes may not sound like the cutting Revilings of a wrathful <HI>Enemy,</HI> but the compassionate Chidings of a displeased <HI>Friend.</HI> We must not dress our Reproofs in Satyr, not launch out into undue vexatious Comments &amp; Invec∣tives.

To offer close convincing Expostulations, allay'd with the Correctives of humble lov∣ing Expressions, is the method of a <HI>wise Reprover. A soft tongue breaketh the Bones.</HI>—So in managing our <HI>Contests</HI> and <HI>Disputes</HI> with one another we should <HI>put away all bitterness and wrath and clamour and evil speaking.</HI> We should <HI>speak the truth in Love,</HI> even when <HI>we contend earnestly for the Faith.</HI> We shou'd endeavour fairly to state, and mildly to debate matters in difference, with easy words and unru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l'd passions.

<P N="2">2. OUR Kindness should <HI>influence our Actions and Deportment towards others.</HI> We must love not only in <HI>Word &amp; Tongue;</HI> but also in <HI>Deed &amp; Demeanour.</HI> Some interpret the Original Word [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] as intending a certain Placedness,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Morum facilitatem &amp; suavitatem, Co∣mitatem, Urbanita∣tem,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE> Civility, Courteous∣ness, Sweetness and Easiness in our Behaviour, whereby we endeavour to please others, &amp; willingly ac∣commodate our selves to them for their Good.

<P>THIS Virtue may be consider'd, as opposite to <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Scorn:</HI> Contrary to this <HI>Good Behaviour</HI> is a Lofty, Domineering, Neglectful Carriage, a Magisterial, Insolent, Regardless, Supercilious Air; Taking State and keeping a Distance: and being difficult of Access: So all Actions and Gestures imperious and disdainful, a big Look, haughtiness of Countenance and Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ure, &amp;c; pointing with the Finger, Shooting out the Lip, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tongue; and so all Mimical Postures &amp; cruel Mockings; 'Tis a part of the Character of a Godly Man, that <HI>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itteth not in the seat of the Scornful.</HI> It was the unhappy Com∣plaint

<P>AGAIN, This Virtue may be consider'd, as opposite to <HI>rash Anger &amp; Passion:</HI> Contrary to this <HI>good Beha∣viour,</HI> is a fiery and furious Carriage, a being impatient and in a flame upon every little Disgust; <HI>Rising up hastily,</HI> knitting the brow and <HI>sharpening the Eyes,</HI> &amp; darting wild Looks, stamping with the Poor, gnashing with the Teeth, snaking the Cane, doubling the Fist, taking by the Throat, Fighting, Dueling, &amp;c. All which is unmanly &amp; unchristian. Sour, Waspish, Fierce &amp; Boisterous Turbulent Carriages are unbecoming the Disciples of the <HI>meek and lowly Jesus,</HI> and give great occ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asion to the Enemy to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aspheme; and no pretences of Temper, Custom, &amp;c. will excuse such, in the Eyes of a Jealous God.</P>

<HI>Naphtali,</HI> that they should be of a refin'd polite and amiable Mein, comparable to the smoothness and sweet∣ness of the loving <HI>Hind,</HI> (Gen. 49. 21.) Good Breeding is a worthy Excellency, when managed with Prudence, and not degenerating into courtly Servility, ceremonious Foppery, and impertinent Officiousness. The Christian and the Gentleman, Serious Piety and true Gentility, are well consistent; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay give a lustre to each other, and in <HI>con∣junction</HI> each appears <HI>most</HI> amiable and shines with a <HI>peculiar</HI> charm. It is an ill sign, when a Man's Religion <HI>corrupts his good manners,</HI> and disposes him to be dis∣respectful to others and forgetful of his Duty &amp; Distance, and such do deform themselves, and blemish their Pro∣fession. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> was a <HI>rough</HI> Man: but <HI>Jacob</HI> was a <HI>smooth</HI> Man: and it was not well done of <HI>Jacob</HI> in personating his Brother to disguise himself with the Skins of Goats. 'Tis Mr. <HI>Henry's</HI> apt reflection upon this.—That they who affect to seem rough and rugged in their Carriage, do put the Beast upon the Man, and really disgrace them∣selves by disguising themselves.</P>
<P>AGAIN, A too great <HI>Austerity</HI> and <HI>Rigidness</HI> is dis∣agreeable to a true Spirit of Kindness, and unbecoming the Christian Profession. Religion does not consist in, nor encourage to, Stoical Reservedness, Severity, Formality, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our Looks, demure Carriage, Unsociableness, and the like. Our Saviour has left us an Example, contrary to and condemning this Carriage. He was free, familiar, open, affable, friendly, (as well as Holy,) in all manner of Conversation. A visible sweetness reigned in His Countenance, and whole Behaviour. A mixture of Gra∣vity and Pleasancy, is most agreeable to the true Tem∣per of Christianity, and most adorns the Doctrine of God our Saviour. Allowance indeed is to be made for some Tempers and Circumstances: but when Austerity is needlesly affected, 'tis highly to be condemned.</P>
<P>AGAIN, A prevailing <HI>Stiffness &amp; Humour s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mness</HI> in our way, is disagreeable to a true Spirit of Kindness.

immoderately tenacious, and inflexible in maintaining our own Rights and Practices, unapt to recede from our par∣ticular Humour, to please others for their Good, is not to act as becometh the Gospel. In the School of Christi∣anity we are taught the great <HI>Lesson o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Self denial,</HI> and the generous <HI>Art of Obliging.</HI> It is but acting a Christian part to be condescending and complying, in respect of the <HI>lawful</HI> Customs, Humours and Manners of the Places and Times we live in, and the Company we converse with. Thus the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> professes himself a <HI>Servant to all for Jesus sake;</HI> represents himself as <HI>becoming all things to all men,</HI> and studious to <HI>please men in all things.</HI> And <HI>we</HI> are bidden to <HI>follow him, as he fol∣lowed Christ</HI> herein. We must <HI>consider one another, and submit our selves one to another, as free, &amp; not using our Liberty as a cloak of maliciousness, but as the Ser∣vants of God.</HI> We shou'd study the Tempers of Men, their Humours and Practices, and <HI>whatsoever Things are just, whatsoever Things are honest, whatsoever Things are lovely, whatsoever Things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and</HI> if there <HI>be any praise, think of these Things,</HI> and put them in practice. <Q>The affecting needless singularity, and indulging our selves in the perverse frowardness of <HI>walking contrary </HI> unto others,</Q> is very inconsistent with <HI>the wisdom which is easy to be intreated.</HI> This Character of the wisdom <HI>that is from Above,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">[<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>]</NOTE> speaks a virtue that is <HI>com∣plying;</HI> which is the genuine meaning of the Original Word, a Disposition <HI>obsequious, tractable, complaisant:</HI> a Temper that will influence us, patiently to suffer our lawful <HI>Liberty</HI> to be narrow'd by the just <HI>Laws</HI> of the <HI>Higher Powers,</HI> and to retrench it our selves in a <HI>charitable</HI> condescension unto <HI>weak Consciences; taking heed lest by any means this Liberty of ours become a stumbling-block to them that are weak.</HI>—But when I speak of <HI>Compliance,</HI> I mean not a yielding in matters of <HI>Duty,</HI> but of Liberty, in Cases of Indifferency or of bare Expediency.

Connivence, and falling in with our Company in sinful ways; nor the mean Arts of Sycophantry, whereby abject Spirits study to get or grow in the favour of Great Men upon whom they have a dependence, by applying and adapting themselves unto the various humours of such.—I mean not a Compliance with others in any thing that shall be prejudicial to them, to their <HI>Souls</HI> especially: or that shall injure and endanger our own Souls.

<PB N="23" REF="002118_0024_0FBB939BCC778B28"/>
give all diligence to promote the Good of the <HI>Souls</HI> of others, will heartily endeavour the Reformation of Sin∣ners, and the Edification of Saints, by Praying for them, by administring Instruction, Advice, Admonition, Exhor∣tation, Consolation, &amp;c. to them as the matter may re∣quire; and also be ready to serve their <HI>external tempo∣ral</HI> Interests, to defend their just Rights, Liberties and Enjoyments, to protect their Persons in a <HI>time of danger,</HI> to relieve them <HI>in</HI> their various <HI>distresses,</HI> &amp; supply them in their necessities, and <HI>assist them in whatsoever business they have need of him:</HI> and also to their Good Name, to secure their rising Credit, or support their sinking Reputation, and vindicate abused Innocence a∣gainst the unjust assaults of Calumny.—These, and such like Services, a truly Kind Christian will do for others. Such friendly Assistences he justly accounts so many due Debts, and holds himself bound to discharge the same.</P>
<P>AGAIN, Kindness is seen and shown in a thankful <HI>Accepting</HI> of Good Offices <HI>from</HI> others, and a readiness (when their is occasion) to come under, and make ac∣knowledgment of, Obligations <HI>to</HI> others. A Commerce or Reciprocation of Good Deeds, a mutual Giving and Accepting of Kindness, is one considerable Point of good Neighbourhood. A free Asking, and Receiving, Kind∣nesses of others, as their is need, discovers no little good Nature and Friendship, and may be called <HI>Passive</HI> Good∣ness and Generosity. But it speaks a certain <HI>Malignity,</HI> to be unwilling to make use of others at all, (as if one were independent and self-sufficient,) and be backward to be obliged or beholden unto any, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urlily to re∣ject kind Offers and Proposals made. This malignity is seen in spurning at just <HI>Reproofs,</HI> refusing wise and rea∣sonable <HI>Advice,</HI> necessary <HI>Charities,</HI> &amp;c. Further, It is the Property of a truly Christian temper, to make suitable Acknowledgment of the Bonds we are under to others; to be apt to aggravate Benefits receiv'd, and ready to make all proper Returns and Requitals, in such a way and manner as speaks Humility, Gratitude and
<PB N="24" REF="002118_0025_0FBB939E02ACD468"/>
Benevolence: and not so as will bewray Pride, Envy, Ill-will, uneasiness and impatience under, and a sullen haste to discharge our selves of, our Obligations.</P>
<P>AND thus I've in some sort stated the true <HI>Nature</HI> of Kindness, and shown what is imply'd in the Duty of the Text. Pass we now to another Thing propos'd, which was—</P>
<P>II. To consider <HI>the Extent</HI> of this Kindness.</P>
<P>AND here in a Word, It is of <HI>universal</HI> Comprehen∣sion, and that as to the <HI>Object</HI> and <HI>Subject,</HI> and <HI>Act.</HI> It must (as to the <HI>Object</HI>) be diffusive, catholick, not under confinement to any particular Person, but impartially dispensing its generous influences unto <HI>All,</HI> according to ability and opportunity. There is Kindness due to all of every Language, Condition, Temper and Perswasion. Our Kindness must not be confin'd within the narrow Pre∣cincts of our own Nation, Land, Town, Church, Neighbour∣hood, Kindred or Family, nor limited to those of our par∣ticular Party, of our way, Principles &amp; Humour, &amp;c. It must reach unto all, whether our own Countrymen, Acquain∣tants &amp; Relatives, or Strangers, Aliens &amp; Foreigners, whether Friends or Foes; whether agreeing with us, or differing from us, in a Perswasion and Inclination; whether Jew or Gentile; Bond or Free; High or Low, Rich or Poor; Good or Bad. We must be <HI>gentle unto all men</HI> and <HI>do good unto all men,</HI> but <HI>especially</HI> unto them, who are <HI>of the houshold of faith,</HI> (Cal. 6. 10.) and that to <HI>all the Saints,</HI> (Col. 1. 4.)—Again, This Kindness shou'd be universal in regard of the <HI>Subject:</HI> as all Persons have a right to this Kindness <HI>from</HI> others, in point of <HI>Privi∣lege:</HI> So all are under Obligation to shew this Kindness <HI>unto</HI> others in point of <HI>Duty.</HI> It is what concerns All, whether <HI>Superiors, Inferiors,</HI> or <HI>Equals.</HI> Either the <HI>Act,</HI> or at least the <HI>Principle,</HI> must be found in <HI>all,</HI> without any Exception.—Again, This Kindness shou'd be uni∣versal, as to the <HI>Exercises</HI> of it. We should be ready to <HI>all</HI> those various <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Carriages,</HI> which are ex∣pressive of this Temper; and should practise this Virtue in all our several Relations, in all Businesses and Concerns
<PB N="25" REF="002118_0026_0FBB939F775A45D8"/>
with others, upon all Occasions and at all Times, in Thought, Word and Deed, according to our Power, unto our Lives End; and this <HI>without respect of Persons, not knowing any man after the flesh,</HI> not being upon any partial Considerations or finister Views <HI>Liberal</HI> in our Exhibitions of Kindness to One, and <HI>In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficious</HI> to Ano∣ther.—<Q>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that we can suppose, we may not make any distinction between Men EMINENTLY GOOD, and EXCEEDINGLY BAD, either in con∣ferring Benefits, in contracting Friendships, in Electing to Offices, in our Intimacies, or the like.</Q> Or that Christianity means to root out all Distinction of Or∣ders and Offices among Men, and to bring Superiours and Inferiours upon one common <HI>Level,</HI> and to entitle all (of however different Qualifications or Degrees▪ to the same Expressions of Honour, Respect and Love, <HI>Putting no difference:</HI> No; but what Christianity demands of us, is that we Love <HI>all</HI> with the same Sincerity, and that we have the same forwardness to do all <HI>Proper</HI> Offices of Kindness, and pay all <HI>due</HI> and <HI>suitable</HI> respects to One as to Another, <HI>doing nothing by Partiality.</HI></P>
<P>I come now—</P>
<P>III. TO consider what <HI>Grounds of Obligation</HI> and <HI>Encouragement</HI> there are to Christian Kindness.</P>
<P>I Shall single out from among many others the few following Arguments, which I shall but glance upon. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. TO be Kind to others, is required of us by many <HI>Divine Precepts.</HI> Besides our Text, there are multi∣tudes of other Scriptures that bind this upon All. Thus, Eph. 4. 32. <HI>Be ye kind one to another,</HI> So 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 8. <HI>Love as Brethren. Be Pitiful, be courteous.</HI> This indeed is one of the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>capital</HI> Laws of the Gospel, and of the same Obligation and Importance with the Law of Faith. Hence Faith in Christ, and Love to our Neighbour, are enjoyned together, as one and the same Commandment, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 23.—And now, do we profess Homage to the blessed God, as our Lawgiver and King, and shall we trample on the <HI>Royal Law of Love,</HI> and transgress one of the Substantial and Cardinal
<PB N="26" REF="002118_0027_0FBB93A0FAAFF0E8"/>
Duties of Religion, peremptorily enjoyned, very fre∣quently and most earnestly pressed and inculcated upon us? If we think we can approve our selves <HI>obedient Chil∣dren,</HI> in the neglect of this <HI>weighty matter of the Law,</HI> we grosly delude our selves.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS is to imitate the <HI>Best Patterns.</HI> Besides the many Examples of the <HI>Saints,</HI> who <HI>have obtained a good Report,</HI> we have the most engaging Example of the <HI>Blessed God,</HI> and of <HI>our gracious Saviour.</HI> Our Heavenly Fa∣ther is <HI>of great Kindness, full of Compassion,</HI> and <HI>abun∣dant in Goodness;</HI> He is <HI>kind, even to the unthankful and the Evil.</HI> Well then may we make that Inference, of our Saviour, (Luk. 6. 36.) <HI>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful:</HI> And that of the Apostle (1 Joh. 4. II.) <HI>Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought to love one another.</HI> Conformity to God is Man's chief Ex∣cellency and Beauty. God's Goodness, or Kindness is what He reputes His chief Glory and dearest Perfection. And shall we not aspire after this bright and shining Character of the Divine Image? <HI>Be ye imitators of God as dear Children, &amp; walk in Love,</HI> Eph. 5. 1, 2. Moreover our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> hath left us an Example, that we should follow His Steps. <HI>ye know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Kindness &amp; Love of God our Saviour,</HI> How He <HI>Pleased not Himself, went about doing Good, follow'd after the Things which make for Peace,</HI> and a∣bounded in all the various Offices of Love to the Souls and Bodies of Men. And <HI>His</HI> Example is monitory of <HI>our</HI> Duty, and bids us <HI>Go &amp; Do likewise.</HI> Phil. 24, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>Look not every man on his own Things, but every man also on the Things of others. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.</HI> We should write after the excellent Copy, He has set us; and by a diligent i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itation endeavour to <HI>shew forth the Vertues of Him, who hath cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed us,</HI> else in vain do we call Him <HI>Lord &amp; Master.</HI> If the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Christ (the great &amp; common Benefactor) be not in us, in vain do we call our selves by His Name.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS is to act <HI>agreeably to the End of our Creation,</HI> and <HI>the true Principles of Humanity.</HI> This is becoming
<PB N="27" REF="002118_0028_0FBB93A26A986F28"/>
the Design of our Being, and the Dignity of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nature, entirely consonant to the genuine Dictates of natural Reason, and the regular inclination of the sanctify'd Will. And it indicates a certain <HI>Greatness</HI> and noble <HI>Generosity</HI> of Soul, it carries in it an unalterable Excellency and sin∣gular Amiableness. 'Tis the high commendation of this Virtue, that it's <HI>approved of men,</HI> [as well as <HI>acceptable to God</HI>] and is one of those things <HI>against which the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is no law,</HI> Gal.5. 22, 3. Whereas the contrary argues a <HI>narrow, little, base</HI> Spirit, beneath our noble Nature, bor∣dering upon the Temper of Hell, and is hisst at by all the World. To <HI>follow Charity and Kindness</HI> is but to <HI>follow Nature,</HI> &amp; pursue one great End of our coming into the World. Hence Benignity may well be term'd Humanity.</P>
<P N="4">4. THIS <HI>puts a Lustre on all our other Excellencies.</HI> Are we wise or Witty, or Learned, or Dextrous in Bu∣siness, or have we Wealth, or Power, or Reputation, or other Accomplishments &amp; Qualifications whatever, They furnish us with so many Advantages for being kind▪ use∣ful and beneficent to others: and the employing them to this end is what sets the price upon them, and gives them their true Excellency. <HI>Without</HI> this they have <HI>no</HI> Glory in comparison. This is <HI>the Excellency of Dignity, and the Excellency of Power,</HI> the Crown, the Beauty and Perfection of all our other Beauties and Perfections. This (even <HI>Ceteris paribus,</HI>) all things else alike makes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man <HI>more Excellent than his Neighbour,</HI> and <HI>more honoura∣ble than his Brethren.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. THIS is one <HI>distinguishing Character, &amp; Cognizance of a Child of God.</HI> This is mentioned as one eminent Effect and <HI>Fruit of the Spirit,</HI> Gal. 5. 27.—And in our Text it is brought in as a Sign and Argument of our <HI>E∣lection,</HI> Sanctification and Acceptance with God. Put on (<HI>as the Elect of God, Holy &amp; Beloved,</HI>) Kindness. And it is observed, that the Word which in our Bibles is <HI>Godly</HI> is sometimes in the Original <HI>Kind.</HI> Thus Psal. 4. 3. <HI>Know that the Lord hath set apart him that is</HI> Godly, <HI>for Himself.</HI> So Psal. 60. 10.—And in other Places, where we find in our Translation <HI>The Saints,</HI> it is in the Hebrew

Let Brotherly Love con∣tinue; Let us Love as Brethren &amp; live in Love, Be kindly affectioned one to another, walk charitably,</HI> Be courteous, obliging, useful, serviceable unto others by all instances of Kindness which lie in our power.—And let our <HI>Love be without Dissimulation, without partiality and without hypocrisy.</HI> Let us Love <HI>in Sin∣cerity and godly simplicity, doing</HI> all offices of Love <HI>hear∣tily as unto the Lord.</HI> Let all our Expressions of Kind∣ness be manag'd <HI>after a godly sort;</HI> with an eye to the <HI>Will of God,</HI> in a way of obedience, and with an aim at the <HI>Glory</HI> of <HI>God</HI> as their ultimate end, and finally with Faith in the <HI>Merits of Christ</HI> for Acceptance with God.—And let our Kindness be <HI>Universal,</HI> extending to all as we have opportunity.—Also <HI>Uniform</HI> &amp; <HI>Constant.</HI> Be not variable and sickle, kind to day and cold to mor∣row. Let not every little Occurrence that displeases us, presently overcast our Faces with a sullen Cloud, alienate our Hearts, shut our Mouths, and close our Hands. <Q>Let our Kindness be as the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪</HI> which with his Beams scatters Mists, and breaks thro' Clouds, that would hinder it's benign Influence and interrupt it's Light.</Q> Our Kindness should shine forth with the brightest and warmest Rays, and that continually.</P>
<P>LET us follow after such Charity, and aim at this exalted Benignity. Let it be our Care and Concern to get our Hearts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnisht with the Principle, and our Lives fill'd with the visible Exercises of true Christian Kind∣ness. And <HI>in Order hereto,</HI> Let us observe the follow∣ing Rules, which I shall only hint, and leave you to en∣large

upon them in your Meditations at Leisure—Let us then see to it, that we get the Causes of Unkind∣ness taken away; Subdue Pride; Watch against unjust Prejudices, which naturally alienate our Love; Effect not unnecessary Reservedness and Retirement, which tends to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our the Mind, and damp the Affections; Be∣ware of dividing Principles and Lusts; Be not devoted to a Party, Have not any Man or S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tt of Men in undue Ad∣miration; Party-Friendship does in effect engage us in Opposition to all but our selves, and leads to numberless unhappy Consequences: And let us learn to deny ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> selves, our Wills and Interests; Diligently observe the <HI>Shame</HI> of Unkindness in others; Consider how <HI>ill we</HI> take unkindness from others; Aggravate our own Un∣kindnesses and not too easily forgive our selves; Get ac∣quainted with Relative Duties, Study our Opportunities of shewing Kindness, Watch all Occasions, give not way to groundless Excuses; Resist all Temptations to Unkind∣ness; Often meditate on the many Excellencies and Ad∣vantages of mutual Benignity: Endeavour to keep Com∣pany with kind and Friendly Persons, which will provoke us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ulation; Keep in our Eye the bright Example of <HI>Jes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Christ,</HI> Contemplate the wonderful Loving-kind∣ness of God our Saviour, which will tend to shame us into an holy imitation: Let us be much in unfeigned Prayer for the good of others, Carry them (especially any whom we may be less inclined to) in the Arms of importunate Supplication, to the Throne of Grace, This will by a sort of natural efficacy work our hearts into a benign Frame. Let us also be much in prayer for our selves, that God would put within us the Grace of Kindness, cherish the same in us, quicken and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and draw it forth in all proper Exercises; And let us lay our Souls open to Divine influences: Moreov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, let us be frequently Examining our Proficiency and Im∣provement in this Virtue, and be o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten thinking of the Recompence of Reward. And finally, <HI>Let us con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> one another, to provoke unto Love and to Good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></P>
