<HEAD><HI>TO A Medical Society in</HI> Boston.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Piece of Medical History does natu∣rally address it self to you, considering that I have the pleasure of being one of your number, that you have been fellow labourers in the management of this distemper, and therefore competent judges of this performance, and that where difficult or extraordinary Cases have oc∣curred in any of your private practice, I was favoured to visit the Patients in order to make a minute clinical enquiry: in short, without your assistance this piece would have been less perfect, and not so well vouched.</P>
<P>As this distemper continues to spread and pre∣vail in several Towns of this and the neighbour∣ing Provinces, I thought it might prove a piece of humanity and benevolence, if after many months diligent observations made in most of the varieties which occur in this Illness, I did en∣deavour to reduce them to some easy distinct Historical and Practical Method. The vanity of appearing as an Author or writer was no in∣ducement, because we all know that in a planta∣tion life neither honour nor credit are to be acquired by writing. It is not published by way
<PB N="ii" REF="004012_0004_10036506CF03EAF8"/>of a Quack bill to procure Patients and their money, as has been the practice of some void of modesty and truth; because the Distemper is al∣most over in <HI>Boston,</HI> and while it prevailed here I could not well have attended more pati∣ents than what I had from time to time under my care, and make with attention the proper observations at the same time.</P>
<P>A secondary reason for my writing is, to induce some Gentlemen of the profession in our other Provinces and Colonies, where this distemper does or may prevail; to give some account of its appearance with them, in order to discover what influence, progress of time, varieties of climate and Soil may have in the phoenomina of this disease. This method, of taking things originally that is from the life, if pursued (but by abler hands) in the Epidemical Distempers which may from time to time happen amongst us, may be of considerable advantage in Physick.</P>
<P>A Speculation that is a novelle might have been composed sooner, but not a real History: for as amongst Naturalists, many repeated obser∣vations and experiments are requisite to form established truths or conclusions; so it ought cer∣tainly to be in the practice of Medicine, where no affair of Speculation or curiosity, but the life and death of a fellow Citizen is the object of our enquiry.</P>

<HEAD>The Practical History of a new Epidemical <HI>Miliary Fever</HI> with an <HI>Angina Ʋlcusculosa.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS Distemper did emerge 20th. <HI>May,</HI> 1735. in <HI>Kingston</HI> Township 50 Miles Eastward from <HI>Boston;</HI> it was no foreign importation, <HI>Kingston</HI> being an inland place, of no Trade or considerable communication. The first seized was a <HI>child who died in three Days Illness;</HI> about a Week thereafter in another Family at four Miles distance, three Children were seized succes∣sively, and died also the third Day; it continues spreading gradually in that Township, seizing here and there particular Families with that degree of violence, that <HI>of the first circiter forty decumbents none recovered</HI> as we were informed. It was vulgarly called the <HI>Throat Illness,</HI> or <HI>a Plague in the Throat,</HI> and alarmed the Provinces of <HI>New-England</HI> very much. Some died of a sudden or acute <HI>Necrosis;</HI> but most of them by a <HI>Symptomatick affiction of the Fauces or Neck;</HI> that is by <HI>Sphacelations</HI> or corrosive <HI>Ʋlcerations</HI> in the <HI>Fauces,</HI> or by <HI>an infiltration and tumefaction</HI> in the Chops and fore part of the Neck, so turged, as to bring all upon a level between the <HI>chin</HI> and <HI>sternum,</HI> occasioning a <HI>strangulation</HI> of the Patient in a very short time.</P>
<P>After a few Weeks it spreads into the neigh∣bouring Townships, but with more mildness. The
<PB N="2" REF="004012_0006_1003650D80396F20"/>first <HI>appearance</HI> that we can recollect of it in <HI>Boston,</HI> was 20th <HI>August</HI> on a Child of Capt. <HI>Stannys</HI> at the North End; having <HI>white specks</HI> in the Throat, and a <HI>cutaneous efflorescence:</HI> A few more in the same Neighbourhood were seized in like manner, about the same time. Towards the end of <HI>Septem∣ber</HI> it appeared in several parts of the Town, with a complaint of <HI>soreness in the Throat, Tonsils, swelled and speckt, Uvula relaxed, slight Fever, flush in the Face, and an Erysipelas like efflorescence on the neck, chest and extremities;</HI> but being of no fatal or bad consequence, nothing more than a common cold was suspected. Our first alarm was from a young Man <HI>How</HI> Aet. 20. in the beginning of <HI>October:</HI> His <HI>History</HI> runs thus; He was lately arrived from <HI>Exeter</HI> to the Eastward, where his Brother died of this Illness; his <HI>Symptoms</HI> were great prostration of Strength, a speck in one of the <HI>Tonsils,</HI> colliquative <HI>Sweats, Pulse</HI> not high and full, but low, hard, stringy, unequal and more frequent than natural, <HI>deglutition</HI> good to the last, no <HI>Sphacelation</HI> in the Throat, no eruption; from a rash inconsiderate opinion of forcibly quelling the <HI>Malignity,</HI> he was thrice let Blood, had some Emeticks and Cathar∣ticks adminstred, and <HI>by profuse evacuations was gra∣dually reduced, so as to die of a gentle decay of natural Strength,</HI> the 6th Day of Illness.</P>
<P>Beginning of <HI>November</HI> it spread considerably in <HI>Boston,</HI> especially amongst <HI>Children,</HI> with more vio∣lent Symptoms, and severals die of it in various Periods: it seemed to be at the hight, as to Num∣bers ailing and quantity of Deaths, the second Week of <HI>March;</HI> that Week there were 24 Buri∣als, whereas <HI>communibus annis</HI> in that Season they are only 9 or 10 <HI>per</HI> Week.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004012_0007_100386AA58729B20"/>
It is generally in so considerable a Degree <HI>more favourable in Boston,</HI> than in the Townships where it first prevailed; that many can scarce be persuad∣ed of its being the same Distemper: It is neverthe∣less essentially the same, there is no Symptom, even the most malignant that has appeared in <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> but what the like has occured in <HI>Boston.</HI> Perhaps <HI>Boston</HI> dry healthy air, good feeding, con∣stitutions less <HI>Psorick,</HI> and the better management of the Sick, favoured us; the reasons for its proving more mortal in the other Towns, may be, the Country woodland and fresh water damps, (the <HI>Sheep</HI> in fenny lands are most susceptible of and suffer most by the <HI>Rot)</HI> their coarse Food, salt Pork diet, <HI>Psorick</HI> Constitutions, (which is one of the principal <HI>Endemial distemperatures in New-Eng∣land)</HI> bad Lodgings, and that <HI>mischievous Practice</HI> of using this Distemper with profuse evacuations, whereby the laudable and salutary <HI>cuticular</HI> erupti∣on has been so perverted as to be noticeable only in a few, and in these it was called a <HI>Scarlet Fever;</HI> the great prostration of Strength essential to this Distemper is so much increased, as to render <HI>Na∣ture</HI> an under match for the assaults of this Illness and its consequences. In fact to the Eastward in some Country Towns, at certain times have died 1 in 3 of the Sick, in others 1 in 4, in scarce any fewer than 1 in 6, whereas in <HI>Boston</HI> not above 1 in 35 have died.</P>
<P>As in most <HI>Epidemical</HI> acute Illnesses, especially <HI>eruptive Fevers,</HI> (witness the <HI>Small Pox</HI>) so in this, are very many varities or degrees, from the most gentle and <HI>benign</HI> to the most <HI>malignant. Symptoms</HI> did vary chiefly from something inscrutable in the <HI>Constitutions</HI> of Families and Persons; the <HI>Scropho∣lous and Psorick</HI> were the most susceptible of it, and
<PB N="4" REF="004012_0008_10036515645836E8"/>did suffer most by it; the <HI>Regimen</HI> had a conside∣rable influence, here some who might have surviv∣ed the <HI>natural Symptoms</HI> did succumb by profuse U. S. and other evacuations, one of the most essen∣tial Symptoms of this Distemper (as before hinted) being <HI>great prostration of Strength.</HI> In so great va∣riety it is not possible to give any concise <HI>scholastick</HI> description, which may comprehend all: We shall therefore, as a <HI>Standard</HI> first describe the most fre∣quent sort, as it appeared in good constitutions.</P>
<P>A previous <HI>listlesness</HI> and languishing counte∣nance for a Day or two, or some other <HI>praenuncia</HI> as u. g. wet Nurses loosing their Milk. The first at∣tack is somewhat of a <HI>chill</HI> or shivering; soon after follows <HI>Head ake</HI> or some other versatile <HI>spasmodick pains,</HI> as pain in the back, joints, side, <HI>&amp;c;</HI> a vomit∣ing or <HI>nausea,</HI> or in some constitutions which are not easily provoked to vomit, only a certain unea∣siness or sickness at Stomach; at the same time the <HI>Vvula</HI> but chiefly the <HI>Tonsils</HI> were tumified, inflam∣eded and painful, with some white <HI>specks;</HI> then follows a flush in the Face and some <HI>miliary erupti∣ons</HI> there, with a benign <HI>mild Fever,</HI> the same esflorescence soon after appears on the neck, chest and extremities; the 3d or 4th Day, Eruption is at the hight and well defined with fair intervals; the flushing goes off gradually, with a general <HI>itching;</HI> and in a Day or two more the <HI>cuticle</HI> scales or peels off, especially in the extremities: At the same time the cream coloured sloughs or specks in the <HI>Fauces</HI> become loose and cast off, and tumefactions there do subside. The Tongue from the beginning is fur'd as in a <HI>Mercurial ptyalism,</HI> urine high coloured, Blood by U. S. more <HI>florid</HI> than natural, in the whole course of the Distemper a very <HI>great prostra∣tion
<PB N="5" REF="004012_0009_100386AFCCC79370"/>of Strength,</HI> and faintness upon recovery, <HI>nervos pains</HI> and weakness in the joints, particularly in the neck, wrists and ancles; universal tenderness to the touch; a tickling guttural cough, some short <HI>Hec∣tick flushings,</HI> and loss of <HI>enbon point.</HI> As in the Measles there is a peculiar smell, so in our Distem∣per the <HI>effluvia</HI> from the Patient have a proper smell; in Children as if troubled with <HI>Worms,</HI> in grown Persons the <HI>rancid smell</HI> of foul Bed Linnen. The <HI>alvine excrement</HI> is of a dark cast and very fetid.</P>
<P>This Standard kind when left to nature, with a warm soft <HI>Regimen,</HI> had generally an easy and sa∣lutary course in six or seven Days; but when by a hot cordial method, or on the other extreme, by being too much exposed to the cold, or by officious <HI>profuse evacuations</HI> Nature was difturbed in her Work; the Distemper was protracted, or some con∣sequential ails from an imperfect defecation en∣n|sued.</P>
<P>Where Nature required any assistance, the prin∣cipal <HI>intentions</HI> were with regard to the cuticular eruption and the <HI>ulcuscula</HI> in the Throat. Any Af∣fection of the Throat does frequently produce a natural <HI>ptyalism: Mercurials</HI> used with discretion are a kind of specifick in such like ulcers &amp; <HI>ulcuscula,</HI> and in fact here they moistned the Throat and Mouth, stopt the spreading of the <HI>ulcuscula,</HI> and promoted the casting off of the sloughs; and as an accessory advantage (the Patients being mostly Children) <HI>destroy'd Worms:</HI> amongst all its pre∣parations <HI>Calomel</HI> answered best, the gentle vomit∣ing or few stools that it occasioned in some, did not confound the natural course of the Distemper: <HI>Turbith</HI> proves generally too strong a revulsion, and the Eruption is thereby too much diverted; this
<PB N="6" REF="004012_0010_1003643AD7F8F298"/>Distemper did not well bear any other evacuations but <HI>Mercurials.</HI> Any detergent <HI>Gargle,</HI> with an addition of the <HI>Tincture of Myrrh and Aloes,</HI> was of good use, especially for the <HI>Vlcuscula,</HI> and did promote the discharge of a ropy Phlegm lodged in the <HI>Fauces.</HI> As to the <HI>cuticular efflorescence,</HI> it was not a scarlet <HI>suffusion,</HI> but a <HI>miliary</HI> palpable erupti∣on, or in lieu thereof in some constitutions a con∣tinued gentle breathing <HI>Sweat;</HI> and in a very few, who have naturally a <HI>liberior transit us</HI> by the <HI>Pores</HI> than is usual, no sensible cuticular excretion; in all the morbid <HI>effluvia</HI> discovered themselves by their peculiar smell: These were with good effect solli∣cited by <HI>Snake-root Tea;</HI> or (as in some Persons) where this did occasion an <HI>ardor</HI> or burning heat, instead of a breathing mellow Sweat, <HI>Sp. C. C.</HI> or any other volatile Spirit in small Herb Teas an∣swered well. <HI>Blisters</HI> and <HI>Suppedanea,</HI> in the begin∣ning where Symptoms were not violent, occasioned a protracted Eruption; in some immediately upon their application, the Eruptions vanished or became less vivid. When the Eruption began to decline a few <HI>loose Stools</HI> were very refreshing. The Pati∣ent being up, and having recovered a competent degree of Strength, is <HI>to be purged</HI> once or twice, to carry off any feculency that may have remained in the Blood and Juices.</P>
<P>For a more distinct conception of the <HI>varities in this Distemper,</HI> they may be reduced to three <HI>Classes.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. Those who die the first, second and third day of Illness, by an irremediable <HI>Necrosis of the Oeco∣nomy:</HI> in such the Seizure is generally sudden, a sinking pain at the Stomach, an extreme prostra∣tion of Strength, a titubating low pulse, in some a stupor, in others a delirium, in some children
<PB N="7" REF="004012_0011_100364985EB5FBF8"/>convulsions, and all of them generally die dozie: they are attended with some <HI>colliquation,</HI> as conti∣nued vomiting, purging, profuse Sweats, bloated∣ness of the habit, an infiltration like that of the <HI>Mumps</HI> vulgarly so called, one or more of these: in general the texture of their blood and juices is much destroy'd and rendred an incoherent puddle of corruption; in fact immediately upon (some∣times before) their <HI>exit,</HI> they have an intolerable <HI>faetor.</HI> In this Class U. S. and other evacuations did accelerate death.</P>
<P N="2">II. Those where the distemper has its common or ordinary course; here the 6 or 7 day seems to be <HI>critical,</HI> and the Symptoms of death or recovery do generally then begin to manifest themselves. Some by peculiarity of constitution, and from im∣proper administrations do die or have an incipicent recovery sooner: others for the like reasons or some particular accidents (u. g. if about the time of regular <HI>monstruation,</HI> the complicated fret occasi∣ons worse Symtoms, and of longer continuance) have this period protracted and in such (where death is inevitable) the Symptoms of death may continue a day or two longer, that is the Patient may die the eighth or ninth day. All who conti∣nue Ill after that period, belong to the third Class, that is of consequential ails.</P>
<P>The Symtoms of <HI>bad Omen</HI> in this Class, are very great prostration of strength, dejection and despon∣dency of mind, titubating low pulse, incessant vomitings purgings or sweats, Tonsils much in∣flamed endangering strangulation, the specks in the <HI>Fauces</HI> of a brownish or leaden colour, or ragged and jagged, a continued <HI>jactantia</HI> in some, in others <HI>a stupor,</HI> refusal of <HI>assumenda</HI> even of diluting com∣mon
<PB N="8" REF="004012_0012_100363E919F8D978"/>drinks, a dry parched skin, Eruptions appear∣ing and disappearing alternately, Eruption univer∣sal of a dark redish cast continuing <HI>crude</HI> many days (because in this as in all eruptive Fevers, the darker or more livid the efflorescence, the more malignant) where the <HI>miliary</HI> pustles are large, distinct and pale like a <HI>chrystaline Small-Pox;</HI> where strong Cordials and <HI>Alexipharmicks</HI> have been used, the face, eye-lids, arms, hands, legs, feet swell, and are of a dark red complexion, as in the most malignant Small-Pox; in children if the <HI>velum Palati</HI> be much affected, with an <HI>ichorous</HI> discharge by the Nose; where many <HI>mucous</HI> linings are expectorated, re∣sembling the cuticle raised by Vesications; when <HI>pus</HI> was brought up, where no sloughs or exulcerati∣ons could be seen in the <HI>Pauces;</HI> where without any difficulty in swallowing, this affection has reached down the <HI>Bronchia</HI> unto the Lungs with the Symptoms of a <HI>New-England Quinsey,</HI> and was erroniously deemed such: the deeper in the <HI>Thorax</HI> the complaint the greater the danger: in some young children with scarce any appearance in the Throat, spreading Ulcers did form behind the Ears in the place where Infants have a natural Issue or running. In some the Tongue did throw off a slough or <HI>Exuvia,</HI> retaining the impressions of the Papillae; being a <HI>Mucus</HI> inspissated, and of the same nature with those mucous linings expectora∣ted from the <HI>Bronchia</HI> or <HI>Oesophagus.</HI> Some have had impostumations in the <HI>Fauces,</HI> with a fatal strangulation, while others have escaped by the discharge of <HI>Ichorous</HI> curdly matter. Some especi∣ally of the adult female kind, have had <HI>Hysterical</HI> or Nervous Suffocations; but of no bad conse∣quence, unless officiously and ignorantly treated with U. S. and other evacuations.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004012_0013_100386C235B9F3B8"/>
The Fever is seldom too high, sometimes it is too low for a thorough laudable Eruption. If the Fever is too high, if the patient is plethorick or accustomed to U. S.; take away some Blood but with discretion; if the <HI>Tonsils</HI> are much inflamed with great pain and difficulty in swallowing, use U. S. in the <HI>Jugulars,</HI> Epispafticks ad <HI>Nucham,</HI> en∣courage the Eruption, or its <HI>succedaneum</HI> a breath∣ing sweat; a profuse <HI>sudor</HI> is equally to be avoided as a continued <HI>Diarrhaea,</HI> either of them confound the distemper in its natural course. In case of colliquations give <HI>ol. Cinamomi, decoct. Alb. Elixir Vitriol, torrified Rhubarb</HI> and the like. As to the specks or sloughs in the <HI>Fauces</HI> (they cast of in course in the benign kind) <HI>Mercurials</HI> inwardly, and the <HI>Gargles</HI> before mentioned topically, are useful; the practice in some Country places of separating them forcibly by <HI>spatulas</HI> is hurtful, because the irritation occasioned thereby induces a further flux upon the part, and the sloughs form again worse conditioned than before. Where the Brain is af∣fected as in <HI>Vigiliae, jactantia, delirium, Coma, stupor,</HI> &amp;c; glysters, Vesicatories &amp; <HI>suppedanea</HI> are to be used. Where faintness or great prostration of strength, give toasted Bread soaked in some gene∣rous Wine and Water, or volatile Spirits in their common drinks; <HI>Bezoars, Testacea</HI> and the like are of no use, the Shop <HI>Cordial Juleps</HI> and mixtures are only sugar'd drams. To enumerate all the other accidental Symptoms which do happen here, in common with other acute diseases, would be trifling.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Consequential ails,</HI> which may be enumerated as in the following articles.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The natural Effects of an intense corrosive scor∣butick
<PB N="10" REF="004012_0014_100364BB811870F8"/>like colliquation of the Blood and Juices. Ana∣sarcous</HI> swelling or blotedness of the face, in some to that degree as to shut up the Eyes; the same <HI>Oedemetous</HI> swellings in the extremities, in a few an Infiltration in the <HI>Scrotum,</HI> in some <HI>Petechiae,</HI> Purple spots, scorbutick like <HI>sugillations</HI> upon the leaft scratch or bruise; <HI>hamorrhages</HI> of all sorts, by the Nose, from the Lungs in expectoration, by Stool, by Urine, <HI>Profluniums</HI> in Women <HI>tempore non debito;</HI> these are dismal <HI>phanomina</HI> in the state of any acute Fever, u. g. <HI>Small Pox,</HI> and scarce any recover; but in our distemper being only short tem∣porary consequential ails, scarce any of them prov∣ed mortal, but gave way to a soft milk diet, in some to <HI>Cortex Peruw.</HI> or <HI>Elixir Vitrioli</HI> in others; a Girle aet. 14. with haemorrhages of several sorts, with Purple spots, and scorbutick like sugillations, recovered, notwithstanding of a very loose <HI>Regi∣men.</HI> N. B. These were not to be attributed to the <HI>Mercurial</HI> administrations, because they equally happened to those who had taken no Mercury.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Where the desecation has not been compleat,</HI> from want of natural strength, or from catching cold, or from undue evacuations: the <HI>reliquiae</HI> were thrown off by <HI>Ʋrtications,</HI> by <HI>Vesications</HI> in several parts of the Body, by <HI>serpiginous</HI> eruptions chiefly in the face, by purulent <HI>Pustules,</HI> by Boils, by swel∣lings and <HI>impostumations</HI> in the groin, armpits and other parts of the Body. The most frequent con∣sequential ail of this kind is, when from cold re∣ceived, the <HI>glands</HI> and cellulary tegument called the <HI>panicula adiposa</HI> in the fore part of the neck becomes infiltrated and obstructed; if not soon re∣solved by the continued fotus of warm woollens and hot animating applications; the induration in∣creases
<PB N="11" REF="004012_0015_100386C59605B200"/>and spreads every way, so as to suffocate some, in others they sphacelate and become Ulcers mortal or of difficult cure: thus a few have died with us in <HI>Boston,</HI> but many in the Country. By catching cold likeways the <HI>Tonsils</HI> have afterwards inflamed and come to suppuration: In a young Woman the <HI>Tonsils</HI> and <HI>Ʋvula</HI> being much ulcera∣ted, did unite and coalesce into one mass and re∣main so; this might have been prevented by fre∣quent gargling.</P>
<P>While these indurations are only in the form of <HI>Kernels</HI> as they are vulgarly called, woollen mufflers, <HI>Empl. de Ranis cum Mercurio</HI> and the like, with gentle <HI>Catharticks,</HI> soon resolves them. <HI>Cataplasms</HI> in this case have done much mischief; because so soon as they are become cold, they act as a chilling damp upon the part, and destroy its vitality. When they arrive to the state of putrid flaccid Ulcerations, digestives and soft fomentations in∣tenerate tenerate the part and occasion the Ulcer to spread; spirituous animating desiccative dressings have done better. Exposing the part to the cold, either in state of Tumefaction only, or in the subsequent ex∣ulcerations aggravates the ail.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>From the violence which the Nerves have suffered in this Illness;</HI> even where the Symptoms were ap∣parently mild, they all complain of great faintness and Universal weakness, particularly in the joints-Some Women have Hyfterick affections, in a few upon recovery imbecility of mind or silliness, in some stammering or loss of Speech for a few days, some have had short fits of Melancholy, some were seized with Epileptick fits, but not so as to become habitual. All these disorders soon vanished, as the Patient recovered his Strength in course of time,
<PB N="12" REF="004012_0016_1003644C52E91C38"/>and by the help of a restorative cordial <HI>Regimen</HI> and diet.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Other consequential ails in common with other fevers;</HI> particularly where the Strength of nature has been much impared by the distemper it self, or by immoderate evacuations, the Patient is left in a languishing weakness. Where the Eruption has been impeded by being exposed to the cold, or by unseasonable <HI>Ʋ S.</HI> or <HI>Catharticks;</HI> the patient falls into <HI>Hectical wastings,</HI> fatal to some in a very short time. All who underwent immoderate evacuati∣ons, were a long time in recovering of their Strength.</P>
<P><HI>SCHOLIA or some general remarks upon the whole.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>This seems to be a new kind of Epidemical dis∣case.</HI> It is not the same with the <HI>Aphthae</HI> which have at times prevailed in <HI>Holland,</HI> as described by <HI>Forestus,</HI> and mentioned by <HI>Boerhaave</HI> in his Colleg∣es. <HI>Tournefort</HI> says there is a distemper not uncom∣mon in the <HI>Levant, viz</HI> a Carbuncle or plague sore in the bottom of the Throat; it carries off chil∣dren in a few days, but does not affect grown People as does ours. Capt. <HI>Morton</HI> of late <HI>Ply∣mouth</HI> Colony, who wrote many years ago his <HI>New. England Memorial,</HI> says that an. 1650. a disease in the Mouth and Throat prevailed, which proved mortal to many in a short time; but he does not describe it, and mentions nothing of a Fever. In <HI>Boston November</HI> 1719. a slight milary fever chiefly with children, but was over in two or three days, unless by catching cold it continued appearing and disappearing alternately for some days longer; there was no complaint of the Throat, and no deaths ensued. It is not the same with the sore Throats which are observed from
<PB N="13" REF="004012_0017_100386CCDDF24A50"/>time to time in some of our Country Towns, espe∣cially in the Winter season: these are Endemial and constitutional, being tumefactious and exulce∣ratious with fluxion in the <HI>Fauces</HI> and Neck; pro∣ceeding from an intense scropholous, scorbutick, or <HI>Psorick</HI> habit (in such subjects vesications by <HI>Can∣tharides</HI> did putrifie) without any Eruptive fever: ours have generally an Eruptive fever or tendency that way, so that of those who have died in <HI>Boston,</HI> not above one in seven died of any Throat ail, but of this fever. It is however observable that the Serophulous and Psorick, are most susceptible of this distemper, and suffer more remarkably.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>This Epidemical distemper is no creature of the Seasons,</HI> it having prevailed from <HI>May</HI> 1735. when it first emerged, the whole year or all the Seasons round. <HI>It is no produce of peculiar climates and soils,</HI> because it hath made its appearance in various places from <HI>Pemaquid</HI> in 44 N. Lat. to <HI>Carolina</HI> South∣ward, and as we are lately informed, it is in our <HI>West India Islands.</HI> It is remarkable that in damp places, as near large Ponds, fresh water Rivers, woodlands, and the like, it has done the greatest execution, as does the <HI>Rot</HI> amongst <HI>Sheep</HI> in fenny Lands.</P>
<P><HI>It is not personally infecting after the rate of the Plague, Small Pox,</HI> &amp;c. where every Person is sus∣ceptible, excepting a very few <HI>anomolous</HI> constitu∣tions. Children are the most obnoxious to any infection; but with us several Children in the family, where the distemper appeared, have escap∣ed: it is true where it happens in a family, it fre∣quently seizeth severals, as is the case with our Country <HI>Peripneumonick Fevers,</HI> and our Autumnal remitting slow Fevers, which cannot be said to be
<PB N="14" REF="004012_0018_100386D1C9EC15B8"/>contagious. The distance in time of Infection to be supposed received from a sick Person, to the time of the distemper's appearing in the supposed infected, could never, with any reasonable allowance of latitude, be reduced to any rule, as in Small-Pox, Measles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We have <HI>Anatomically</HI> inspected Persons who died of it with so intense a <HI>faetor</HI> from the violence of the disease, that some Practioners could not continue in the room; but without be∣ing infected our selves or carrying it into families. Many children without reserve, frequent the hou∣ses and chambers of the sick, and escape. <HI>It does therefore proceed from some undiscovered quality of the air, affecting only peculiar constitutions of persons and families:</HI> notwithstanding of its being generally favourable, it proves fatal to certain families; ma∣ny families for this reason have buried all or most of their children, u. g. <HI>Boynton</HI> of <HI>Newbury-Falls</HI> lost his eight children, at <HI>Hampton-Falls</HI> in 5 fa∣milies died 27 Persons.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>This is a very anomalous Illness,</HI> some complain a day or two before they are confined, some are seized as it were instantaneously, it is generally most severe with these last. In some a soreness of the Throat and darting pain there, reaching the Ears, is previous to all other Symptoms; in others the common Symptoms of a fever appear, before any inflamation or specks are perceivable in the <HI>Fauces.</HI> Some have a sore Throat without any perceivable cruption, only a gentle breathing continued Sweat, or an increased insensible perspiration with the peculiar smell of the morbid <HI>effluvia.</HI> Some (but very few) have the cuticular eruptions without any sloughs in the Throat; only the <HI>Tonsils, Ʋvula, and velum Palati,</HI> tumified and inflamed; and in a few,
<PB N="15" REF="004012_0019_100364A818E52370"/><HI>a purulent</HI> discharge from some parts deeper than the <HI>Fauces,</HI> that is lower than the sight can reach, these are not without danger. Many of those who died early of a <HI>Necrosis,</HI> had no tumefaction, infla∣mation or specks in the Throat.</P>
<P>The time of Eruption is very uncertain; in a very few it preceeds the soreness of the Throat, in a few it goes <HI>pari passu</HI> with the affection of the <HI>Fauces;</HI> but generally it is (not much) later than the first complaints of the Throat, in a young Woman it was later by 14 days.</P>
<P>In ruddy complexions the efflorescence is very discernable; it is not so distinctly perceivable in Brunets, Indians, and Negroes; unless the miliary Eruption have a considerable <HI>Relievo</HI> as in some, they generally scale and peal notwithstanding. Sometimes it appears only in the cheeks, sometimes only a few clusters in the extremities. Sometimes the <HI>suffusion</HI> was scarce miliary and vanished insen∣sibly by becoming gradually paler without scaling. Where the Miliary Eruptions were considerable, the extremities peel in scraps or strips like <HI>Exuviae;</HI> in one or two the nails of the fingers and toes did cast off. The period or continuance of Eruption is sometimes prolonged by weakness of nature, by undue evacuations, or by the Patients being expos∣ed to the cold.</P>
<P N="4">4. In some who were very slightly affected, their Illness was of a much shorter continuance, than is described in the Standard kind. <HI>Most of those who died of the Physician died by immoderate evacuations.</HI> As to the deaths, only a few were occasioned im∣mediately by any distemperature of the Throat; they were generally the effect of the Fever, either by an immediate <HI>Necrosis</HI> at first seizure, or by the
<PB N="16" REF="004012_0020_100386D9C61E4CA8"/>ordinary fatality of Fevers, or by consequential ails. In <HI>Boston</HI> at a medium of the last eight heal∣thy years (1723. 1724. 1725. 1726. 1727. 1728. 1732. and 1733) in the Months of <HI>October, Novem∣ber, December, January, February, March, April</HI> to 18th <HI>May,</HI> died <HI>pr. an.</HI> 268 Whites and Slaves; this year in the same space of time died 382, is 114 <HI>extra</HI> deaths, and may be resonably charged to this Illness, it being otherways a healthy time: of these 114. about 71 cases came to my knowledge, whereof in the first period died 35, in the second period 28, and of consequential ails, 8. Of these 71, only about 10 can be said to have died of sore Throats. Of these 71 only 9 were upwards of 14 <HI>aet.</HI> According to the nearest estimate I can make in round numbers, about 1 in 35 have died, that is about 4000 Persons in <HI>Boston</HI> have had this distem∣per, which is about one 4th part of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Summer 1735 was unusually wet and chilly with many Easterly winds, in the Summer &amp; Autumn it prevail'd and was very mortal in several Country Towns. In <HI>Boston</HI> it began in Autumn, but did not prevail until Winter, which was not rigid with hard frosts as is usual, but with a very disagreeable chill in the air, especially in the Month of <HI>March</HI> last, in which Month was our greatest Mortality.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Most Malignant distempers affect to throw off their malignancy by some Emunctory.</HI> The despumation of this acrid inqination of the juices in our distemper, that is, its natural <HI>Crisis,</HI> seems to be by the patent and salutary <HI>Emunctories</HI> of the <HI>Fauces</HI> and skin. In corrosive taints, u. g. Venereal and others, a <HI>Mer∣curial ptyalism</HI> and sudorifick decoction of the <HI>woods,</HI> answer best; this gave us the hint of promoting
<PB N="17" REF="004012_0021_100386DDE23FBB10"/>the tendency of nature in our Illness, by Mercurials, and gentle breathing Sweats a bed; which with good management seldom fail'd, excepting where the <HI>Necrosis</HI> was irremediable from the beginning.</P>
<P><HI>Some affiction of the Throat seems to attend most kinds of Eruptive Fevers.</HI> In the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> (even where the pustules and other Symptoms were in the smal∣lest degree) they all complain of a soreness of the Throat, but without ulcerating. In the <HI>Measles</HI> there is a hoarsness, and soreness of the Throat. <HI>In ours</HI> besides the soreness, tumefaction, and inflam∣mation in the <HI>Fauces;</HI> there are specks or sloughs of a mellow white or Cream colour, like those on the inside of the cheeks in a Mercurial ptyalism; the Scrophulous and Venereal ulcers in the Throat are yellow; Aphthae are more of the nature of <HI>phlyc∣tenae;</HI> many of our Patients complain of a copperish taste or peppery smart in the Throat, as they ex∣press it.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>As in all other distempers so in this there do some∣times happen violent Symptoms, meerly from the Regimen and Medicines used;</HI> which on that account are not of that bad consequence, as if they had proceeded from the distemper in its natural course u. g. in some constitutions a <HI>Turbith bolus</HI> operates with violence, so as to occasion shiverings, torsions of the Bowels, and Spaims, as if the Patient were moribund: <HI>Calomel</HI> even in very small doses seizeth the Mouth of some to a very considerable degree of inconveniency.</P>
<P N="8">8 <HI>We did not observe any genuine second seizures.</HI> It is true, being Winter Season, many common sore Throats, that is, relaxations of the <HI>Ʋvula</HI> and in∣flammations of the Tonsils; have passed with the less observing practitioners, for the genuine Epe∣demick
<PB N="18" REF="004012_0022_100386E3B6944E28"/>and were used accordingly; such have after∣wards had this Illness, and was erroneously called a second seizure. N. B. Our <HI>Epidemick</HI> is attended with no cough, unless when complicated with a cold or some old habitual <HI>Tussis:</HI> upon recovery, it leaves frequently a small <HI>catarrhous</HI> colliquation or cough, but of short continuance.</P>
<P>In some after being well, upon catching cold, the <HI>Tonsils</HI> have been inflamed even to suppuration; in others the <HI>Ʋvula</HI> and <HI>Velum Palati</HI> infiltrated and some <HI>phlyctenae</HI> or common <HI>Aphthae,</HI> have appeared. Such have also by some been deem'd as second seizures, and used as such.</P>
<P>After a long continuance of cold chilly Weather, there set in suddenly warm Weather hot as mid Sum∣mer. <HI>May</HI> 25th, 26th, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> several children, who formerly had this Eruptive sever, have an efflorescence or <HI>miliary</HI> eruption by the heat, as is not unusual with children in hot weather: this was by mistake of some practitioners and others, called a second sei∣zure.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>No conditions of Mankind were exempted</HI> (in our Epidemical Autumnal <HI>dysentery A.</HI> 1734. the Ne∣groes escaped) Europeans, West-India Islanders, Indi∣ans and Negroes, of all ages, were equally subject to it: but, as in most Epidemical diseases, it affected Chil∣dren and the younger Persons more generally.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>This is a Real History of the distemper as it ap∣peared in Boston New-England,</HI> taken clinically from the life and not copied. There is no stroak or clause, but what I can vouch by real not imaginary cases. It is founded only upon observations or <HI>phaenomina,</HI> that is upon the Symptoms that appeared in the course of this Epidemical disease; it must therefore be of permanent truth.</P>
