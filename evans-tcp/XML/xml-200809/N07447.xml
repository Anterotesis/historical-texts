<Q><BIBL>PHIL. 1. 21.</BIBL>
For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the Words of the Apostle <HI>Paul.</HI> In the 20th ver. he declares, that it was his earnest Expectation and Hope, that Christ should be magnified in his Body, whether by Life, or by Death. In this Ver. he gives a Reason of his Hope: <HI>For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</HI> i. e. says an Expositor, "If I live, Christ shall be the Scope of my Life, and End of my Living; I resolve to live to his Service: if I die, Death will be a real gain to me." Others read the Words, "Christ is to me in Life and Death, Advantage or Gain."</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="2" REF="009513_0004_0F758B78681B41F8"/>I. It is the Character of every true Christian, and faithful Gospel Minister; that for them to live is Christ.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is their great Priviledge and Happiness, that for them to die shall be gain.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>It is the Character of every true Christian, and faithful Gospel Minister; that for them to live is Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. This is the Character of every <HI>true Christian.</HI> All such as are given up to Christ in Baptism, and profess to be his Disciples; are under solemn Obli∣gations to seek the Spirit of Christ, that they may live to him; and it is the Character of those who are Christians indeed, that they make the Gospel of Christ, the <HI>Rule,</HI> and the Glory of God in Christ, the great <HI>End</HI> of their living. It is their great Concern and Endeavour, to depart from all Iniquity, and to walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, by walking as becometh the Gospel, even as the Grace of God, that bringeth Salvation teacheth us, <HI>that denying Ungodliness and worldly Lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present World:</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii.12.</NOTE> They not only call Christ, Lord; but do the Things which he says. They devote their Time and Talents, yea, their Lives to his Service.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is the Character of every <HI>faithful Gospel Minister, that for him to live is Christ.</HI> The A∣postle <HI>Paul</HI> calls himself a Minister of the Gospel:<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph. iii.6, 7.</NOTE> and it was his Care to live as became such an one.</P>
<P>To illustrate and confirm this Head, I would ob∣serve,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="009513_0005_0F758B7900921E40"/>1. It is the great Concern of such <HI>to obtain the Evidence of their Union with Jesus Christ, and of his dwelling in their Hearts by Faith.</HI> They are sensible, that unless they are united to him by his Spirit, and a living Faith; they can have no spiritual Communion with him in his saving Benefits. <HI>He that is joined to the Lord, is one Spirit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. vi.17.</NOTE>.</HI> And unless they are thus in Christ, they can't derive Grace from him to fulfil their Ministry; nor in a right Manner depend upon him to fulfil his Word; <HI>I am with you alway.</HI> If destitute of that Faith, which works <HI>by Love,</HI> tho' they had the most shining Gifts, and could speak with the <HI>Tongues of Angels,</HI> yet they are but as sounding Brass; an empty Noise: and what∣ever Good others might receive by their Ministry, they themselves must be cast away. Accordingly, they are earnestly concerned that they may be able to say with the Apostle, <HI>I knew a Man in Christ:</HI> and that they may be found in him, cloathed with the Righteousness of God, by Faith in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P N="2">2. This implies <HI>their sincere Concern and Endea∣vour to be acquainted with the Gospel in such a Measure, that they may be qualified to lead Souls to Christ, and build them up on their holy Faith.</HI> They are sensible, that this is the great Design and Use of the Gospel Ministry, to lead Men to Christ, as the only Saviour of perishing Sinners. The same Apostle teacheth, that it is for the <HI>edifying of the Body of Christ;</HI> 'till we all come in the Unity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv.12, 13.</NOTE> — And therefore the faithful Minister, determineth not to know any Thing among his People, <HI>save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</HI> Now, under this, is comprehend∣ed, the Knowledge of the Truths, Doctrines and Pre∣cepts of the Gospel of Christ; concerning the My∣stery
<PB N="4" REF="009513_0006_0F758B79C480FC10"/>
of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; his divine and human Natures united in one Person; his Offices, Laws, and saving Benefits. Accordingly, the faithful Minister of Christ, gives himself to Reading, Meditation and Prayer, that his Lips may preserve and communicate this Knowledge to his Hearers; that his Light may shine before others, to give them the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Jesus Christ. And this leads me to say,</P>
<P N="3">3. That the great Care and Endeavour of the faithful Minister, is to <HI>preach Jesus Christ;</HI> and <HI>teach the Things which concern his Kingdom and Glory.</HI> Thus <HI>Paul</HI> preached the Kingdom of God; and taught those Things which concern the Lord Je∣sus Christ.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Act. xxvili.31.</NOTE> And in another Place, he tells us, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv.5.</NOTE> <HI>We preach not our selves, but Christ Jesus the Lord.</HI> They dare not impose their own Notions, nor teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men; but la∣bour to keep close to the pure Doctrines of the Gos∣pel, teaching Men to observe <HI>all Things whatsoever Christ has commanded.</HI> The End and Scope of their Ministry, is not to gain the Applause of Men, by proselyting them to any darling Opinions of their own, but to teach them the Knowledge of God and Christ, and the Way of Salvation as revealed in the infallible Oracles of the old and new Testament; that their Faith may stand not in the Wisdom of Men, but in the Power of God. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii.5.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. The faithful Ministers of Christ, <HI>live by the Faith of the Son of God.</HI> And in this Respect, for to live to them is Christ. The Lord Jesus is the Be∣liever's Life, and every faithful Pastor is sensible of this. Agreeably, the Apostle says to <HI>Timothy,</HI> 2 Epist.
<PB N="5" REF="009513_0007_0F758B7A50D55768"/>
ii 1. <HI>Thou therefore, my Son, be strong in the Grace that is in Christ Jesus.</HI> And declares concerning himself: <HI>The Life which I now live in the Flesh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</HI> Gal. ii. 20 He acknowledgeth that his Furniture and Ability for his sacred Work, were from the Lord, and that he liv'd upon Him, who <HI>counted him faithful, putting him into the Ministry.</HI> Such realize it, that all their Sufficiency is of God, and is communicated to them through the Mediation of Jesus Christ, the glorious Head of the Church; and accordingly, they run the Race set before them, looking unto Jesus, as the Au∣thor and Finisher of their Faith: who said to this Apostle, in a time of Extremity, <HI>My Grace is suffici∣ent for thee; for my Strength is made perfect in Weakness.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor, xii.9.</NOTE></P>
<P N="5">5. It implies, that it is their great <HI>Care and Endea∣vour to follow the Example of Jesus Christ.</HI> When the Apostle says, <HI>for me to live is Christ,</HI> it intends, that he look'd unto Jesus, as his Pattern and Exem∣plar, and labour'd that the same Mind might be in him, which was in Christ Jesus, 1 Cor. xi. 1. <HI>Be ye Followers of me, even as I am of Christ.</HI> The true evangelical Pastor is concerned, that the like Zeal for the Glory of God, the Purity of his Worship, and the Salvation of the Soul's of Men; the like Humility, Patience and Submission to the Will of God; may be in him, which were so conspicuous in the Man Christ Jesus. It is his Care, that he may shew forth the Virtues of this lovely Person, who was holy, harm∣less, undefiled, and separate from Sinners: He not only preacheth, but lives the Gospel in some good Measure; bearing in Mind what our Lord said, when he had washed his Disciples Feet, Joh. xiii. 14, 15. <HI>If I then your Lord and Master, have washed your
<PB N="6" REF="009513_0008_0F758B7B182A4780"/>
Feet, ye also ought to wash one another's Feet, For I have given you an Example, that ye should do as I have done to you.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The Scope and End of their Lives and Mini∣stry are, that God in Christ <HI>may be glorified.</HI> They seck not their own primarily, or chiefly, but the Things which are Jesus Christs; that God in Christ may be glorified: many being brought to trust in him, to turn to God by him, and live as the obedient Subjects of the Lord. It is not their own Honor or Profit, which they are principally concerned for, but the ho∣nor of Christ; that many may ascribe Glory and Ho∣nor and Blessing to Him that sitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb forever. Thus for them to live is Christ; when the great End of their Lives is to exalt the Re∣deemer, and that his Gospel may run and be glori∣fied in the Salvation of many, form'd to shew forth his Praise. 1 Pet iv. 11. <HI>if any Man speak, let him speak as the Oracles of God; if any Man minister, let him do it as of the Ability which God giveth: that God in all Things may be glori∣fied through Jesus Christ; to whom be Praise and Dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>The principal Joy of their Lives is to behold the Kingdom of Christ, set up with Power, and flou∣rishing in their own Souls, and in the Hearts of God's People.</HI> It is the Spirit and Temper of every faith∣ful Minister, to rejoyce in Christ Jesus, and have no Confidence in the Flesh. They love the Lord Jesus; and from love to Him, they feed his Sheep, and feed his Lambs. And from this cordial Affection, wish Prosperity to the Son of <HI>David.</HI> The Blessings of his Kingdom, which are Righteousness and Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost, are more to them, than the Joy of Harvest. 1 Thess. iii, 8, 9. <HI>For now we live,
<PB N="7" REF="009513_0009_0F758B7C17B8A990"/>
if ye stand fast in the Lord: For what Thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the Joy where∣with we Joy for your Sakes before our God.</HI> It was the Comfort of their Lives, to behold the Thessalo∣nians stedfast in the Belief and Practice of the Reli∣gion of Jesus; yea, they were their <HI>Crown and Joy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 thes. ii.20.</NOTE>.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>They count not their Lives dear, that they may finish their Conrse with Joy, and the Ministry which they have received of the Lord Jesus.</HI> It was the Spirit of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Act. xx.24</NOTE> and every faithful Pastor labours after the same Mind. He would not miss of the great End of living to the Lord Jesus; no, not for the sake of prolonging this frail Life, and the Com∣forts of it. They spend, and are spent for the Service of their great Master; and their great Care is to finish well, and receive the Reward of good and faith∣ful Servants, Rom. xiv. 7, 8. <HI>For none of us liveth to himself, and no Man dieth to himself: For whe∣ther we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord; whether we live there∣fore, or die, we are the Lard's.</HI></P>
<P>And this brings me [to the second Head: Which is to consider,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The great Priviledge and Happiness of such, for whom to live is Christ: for them to die shall be gain.</HI></P>
<P>Christians, and Gospel Ministers, <HI>must die,</HI> as well as others. <HI>It is appointed unto Men once to die.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix.27.</NOTE> We have all sinned; and the Wages of Sin, is Death. Rom. v.12. — <HI>By one Man Sin entred into the World, and Death by Sin; and so Death hath passed upon all Men, for that all have sinned.</HI> In this Respect, there is one Event to the Righteous and to the Wick∣ed. There is no Discharge in that War: We must all encounter this last Enemy, and fall by his Hand∣delivered
<PB N="8" REF="009513_0010_0F758B7C91E8C720"/>
Indeed, by Faith in Christ, every true Believer is deliver∣ed from Sin, the Sting of Death; but not from the Stroke of Death. <HI>These all died in Faith <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi.13.</NOTE></HI> God will have this Mark of his holy Displeasure against Sin abide in all A∣ges, even upon his own Children. They must in this Re∣spect be conformed to the Son of God, who first suf∣fered Death, &amp; through this dark Valley, passed into Glo∣ry. Yea, the Ministers of the Everlasting Gospel, who have spoken to us the Word of Life, must die as well as others. <HI>Paul</HI> must be offered: <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 pet. i.14.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> must <HI>put off this Tabernacle.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 pet. i.14.</NOTE> Our Fathers, where are they; and the Prophets, do they live for ever? No surely; the Treasure is in earthen Vessels, which must in a little time be broken to Pieces. A Consideration this, which should excite Ministers and their People, to wait all the Days of their appointed Time, until their Change come, in a believing Expectation of it, and a diligent Preparation for it; for then, the Day of Death, will be better to them than the Day of their Birth.</P>
<P N="1">1. At Death <HI>they are delivered from Sin, and made perfect in Holiness.</HI> Here they complain, that when they would do Good, Evil is present; and they cry out with the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom. vii. 24. <HI>O wretch∣ed Man that I am, who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death.</HI> But when they put off this mortal Body, they put off the old Man which is corrupt, accord∣ing to the deceitful Lusts; and are joined with the Spirits of just Men made perfect, in the Kingdom of Glory, where they behold God's Face in Righteousness, and are satisfied with his Likeness. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi.13.</NOTE> O blessed Change!</P>
<P N="2">2. They are <HI>delivered</HI> from every <HI>distressing Evil. Man that is born of a Woman, is of few Days, and full of Trouble,</HI> Job xiv. 1. While Sin, that abomi∣nable Thing, remains in them, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psal. xvii.15.</NOTE> God sometimes hides
<PB N="9" REF="009513_0011_0F758B7D600645D0"/>
his Face, and they are troubled. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxx.7.</NOTE> But in Heaven, the Light of his Countenance shines upon them, with∣out any interposing Cloud; and they are satisfyed in the full Manifestations of his Love. Here, their Bo∣dies are subjected to painful Diseases: The Psalmist cries to God, O Lord, heal me, for my <HI>Bones are vexed:</HI> I am weary with my groaning: But in Hea∣ven, there is neither Sorrow nor Crying; neither shall there be any <HI>more Pain.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev xxi.4.</NOTE> In this World, they are an∣noyed by Satan's Temptations; at Death they are con∣voy'd by holy Angels, to the heavenly Paradice, where this old Serpent cannot come to shoot his fiery Darts at them. Here they sympathize with others under their Afflictions: At Death, these Tears are wip'd from their Eyes. Here, they are subject to various Injuries from the Men of this World; there the Wick∣ed cease from troubling, and the weary are at Rest. Here, they are subject to painful Bereavements, and are called to weeping and mourning. Thus heavy Tidings were brought to <HI>Job,</HI> that the <HI>young Men</HI> were dead; upon which, <HI>he rent his Mantle,</HI> fell down upon the Ground, and worshipped; in Heaven, there is <HI>no more 'Death;</HI> but the Saints reign in Life by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. At Death they <HI>leave this World, and go ever to be with the Lord.</HI> O blessed Exchange! This evil World is devour'd by the Curse; there, in the heavenly <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> shall be <HI>no more Curse.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxii.3.</NOTE> While they are at home in the Body, they are absent from the Lord; but when absent from the Body, they are present with the Lord, and <HI>go to be with Christ, which is far better:</HI> v. 23. Context. Heaven is compar'd to an House, Joh. xiv. 2. <HI>In my Father's House are many Mansions.</HI> To a <HI>City,</HI> whose Buil∣der and Maker is God. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi.10</NOTE> It hath no need of the Sun
<PB N="10" REF="009513_0012_0F758B7E6F399598"/>
to shine in it; for the Glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi.23.</NOTE> In this blessed Place, our Saviour's Prayer is fully answered, Joh. xvii. 24. <HI>Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my Glory which thou hast given me.</HI> And they are by their Redeemer presented to the Father faultless, and with exceeding Joy. They stand in God's Presence; in which is fulness of Joy, and Pleasures for evermore.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>They have the blessed Society of holy Angels, and perfected Saints.</HI> These faithful Disciples of Christ, go to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innu∣merable Company of Angels; to the general Assem∣bly, and Church of the First-born, which are written in Heaven. <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii 22, 23.</NOTE> They have an intimate Communion with the Angels, who in this Life are ministring Spi∣rits to the Heirs of Salvation; and no Doubt, do many good Offices for them, under Him, who is the Head over all Things to the Church. And being made perfect in Knowledge and Love, there is not the least Jar to disturb the Harmony of their united Prai∣ses to God and to the Lamb.</P>
<P N="5">5. They <HI>serve God after the most perfect Manner, in the sublime Exercises of Devotion.</HI> While here, they lov'd the Habitation of God's House, and esteemed a Day in his Courts, better than a Thousand. But alas! while in the Body, they find both natural and moral Infirmities, hindering them in these spiritual Exercises; and when most rais'd in devout Af∣fections towards God and Christ, the Day of spiri∣tual Rest is soon ended: In Heaven they keep an eternal and uninterrupted <HI>Sabbatism.</HI> Here their Fellowship with the Father and the Son, is mediate;
<PB N="11" REF="009513_0013_0F758B7EE77862A8"/>
there they have no need of the outward Means of Grace in the Administration of the Word and Sacra∣ments. Now they see thro'a Glass, darkly; but then, Face to Face. Now they taste of the Fatness of God's House, and sip of the River of his Pleasures; then they shall cat of the Tree of Life in the heavenly Paradice; and drink of the pure River of Water of Life, clear as Christal, proceeding out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxii.1.</NOTE> In a Word, they wait in a joyful and certain <HI>Expectation of the Redemption of their Bodies,</HI> and a full Reward at the <HI>Resur∣jection</HI> of the Just. At Death, they commit their Spirits into the Hands of Christ, and receive that blessed <HI>Euge</HI> from their Lord and Judge, Matth, xxv. 21. <HI>Well done, thou good and faithful Servant; thou hast hast been faithful over a few Things, I will make thee Ruler over many Things: enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord:</HI> A Reward of free Grace, thro' the Merits of the Redeemer. However, their Bodies must sleep in the Dust, till Christ, who is their Life, shall appear; then shall they appear with Him in Glory, and awake to everlasting Life; for Christ is risen from the Dead, and become the first Fruits of them that slept. For since by Man came Death, by Man came also the Resurrection from the Dead. For as in <HI>Adam</HI> all die, even so in <HI>Christ,</HI> shall all be made alive. Then this corruptible must put on In∣corruption, and this mortal, must put on Immortality. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv.52.</NOTE> And to this Effect speaks the same Apostle, Phil. iii. 20, 21. <HI>Our Conversation is in Heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: who shall change our vile Body, that it may be fashi∣oned like unto his glorious Body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all Things unto himself.</HI> And in that illustrious Day, when the Son of God shall come in his Glory, and all the holy
<PB N="12" REF="009513_0014_0F758B805D206008"/>
Angels with Him, and shall sit upon the Throne of his Glory, He will set these his Sheep on his right Hand, and say to them, <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foun∣dation of the World:</HI> And these shall go away into Life eternal. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxv.31.</NOTE> Surely then, for them to die, is Gain. And this Honor and Happiness have all the Saints. 2 Tim. iv. 7, 8. <HI>I have fought a good Fight, I have finished my Course, I have kept the Faith. Hence∣forth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteous∣ness, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give me at that Day: and not to me only, but unto all them that love his appearing.</HI> However, where Persons have been called to eminent Services, and have by the Grace of God been faithful to the Death, they shall reap bountifully, according to God's Riches in Glory by Jesus Christ. Our Saviour speaks of a <HI>Prophet's Reward.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. x 41.</NOTE> And the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> says of faithful Shepherds, 1 Pet. v. 4. <HI>When the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a Crown of Glory, that fadeth not away.</HI> And the Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> Chap. xii. 3. <HI>They that be wise, shall shine as the bright∣ness of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteousness, as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI> But Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither have en∣tered into the Heart of Man, the Things which God hath prepared for them that love Him. However, these few imperfect Hints may shew us, that such as live to Christ, shall happily find, that to die is gain.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>USE 1. From what has been said, we learn, <HI>that the Soul is a spiritual Substance, which lives, acts and enjoys, when separated from the Body by 'Death.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="009513_0015_0F758B818D5E7088"/>If the Soul perished with the Body, or was laid asleep in a State of inactivity, until the Resurrection, the Apostle, who had such a Zeal for his Master's Service, could never have desired to depart this Life. We read, Gen. ii. 7. <HI>The Lord formed Man of the Dust of the Ground, and breathed into him the Breath of Life; and Man became a living Soul.</HI> God forms the Spirit of Man within him; which is a liv∣ing, active and intelligent Being, spiritual and im∣mortal; and in this Respect, bears some Resem∣blance to it's Creator, who is a Spirit, and the Fa∣ther of Spirits. Agreably, the Word of God assur∣eth us, that when the <HI>Dust returns to the Earth as it was, the Spirit shall return to God who gave it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccl. xii, 7</NOTE>.</HI> Let us not then, my dear Brethren, be so much con∣cerned about our Bodies; What we shall eat, or what we shall drink, or wherewithal we shall be cloathed; as to neglect our precious &amp; immortal Souls. O let it be our first &amp; chief Care, to seek that these may be cloathed with the perfect Righteousness of Christ, sanctified by his Spirit, and fed with that living Bread, which nourisheth the inward Man, to eternal Life. Let the Words of the Redeemer, sink deep into your Hearts, Mark viii. 36, 7. <HI>What shall it profit a Man, if he shall gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul? or what shall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</HI></P>
<P>USE II. Then, if we would <HI>die the Death of the Righteous, we must live his Life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Balaam</HI> said, let me <HI>die the Death of the Righ∣teous,</HI> and my last End be like his; but this can't be, if like him, we love the Wages of Unrighteousness, and die in our Sins. The Children of God, are blessed in their Death. Death is their's, and a Mes∣senger

of Peace to them; which declareth, that their Warfare is accomplished. Isai. lvii. 1, 2. <HI>The Righ∣teous perisheth, and no Man layeth it to Heart; and merciful Men are taken away, none considering that the Righteous is taken away from the Evil to come. He shall enter into Peace: they shall rest in their Beds, each one walking in his uprightness.</HI> But un∣less we are in Christ, this Enemy will come armed with a deadly Sting, by Reason of Sin, and the Curse of the Law. The second Death will follow the first, and that is eternal. Rev. vi. 8 <HI>I looked, and behold a pale Horse; and his Name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him:</HI> Whereas, it is said of such as are washed in the Blood of Christ, Rev. vii 17. <HI>The Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne, shall feed them, and shall lead them unto Fountains of living Waters: and God shall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes.</HI> O, let such then as are dead in their Sins, be awakened to seek Grace, that they may hear the Voice of the Son of God, and live. you must be united to Christ, by his Spi∣rit dwelling in you: You must live to Him, or you perish for ever. Joh. iii. 36. <HI>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting Life: and he that believ∣eth not the Son. shall not see Life; but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</HI></P>
<P>USE III. Let such as are <HI>invited to the Lord's Table this Day, thankfully remember his dying Love, and encourage themselves in the Lord.</HI> Come, and behold Jesus, evidently set forth crucified, having his Bod broken, and his Blood poured out unto Death; that through Death, he might destroy him that had the Power of Death, that is, the Devil; and deliver them, who through fear of Death, were all their Life∣time subject to Bondage. Come, and behold your Redeemer, purchasing the Victory by his Death on
<PB N="15" REF="009513_0017_0F758B82ACA71378"/>
the Cross. Come, and behold Him risen a Conque∣ror over Sin and Satan, Death and the Grave; and now ever living to make Intercession for us. Having such an Advocate with the Father, who appears in Heaven for us, as a Lamb that had been slain, we should trust in the Lord for ever, and say as Rom. viii. 32. <HI>He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all Things?</HI> Behold! the Son of God in our Nature, lives and reigns in Heaven for us: and when this glorious Head of the Church ascended on high, received <HI>Gifts for Men,</HI> and <HI>gave Apostles;</HI> and also <HI>Pastors and Teachers.</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv.11.</NOTE> Let us then continue instant in Prayer, that God would supply our Wants, according to his Riches in Glory by Jesus Christ. And let us cast our Cares and Burdens on Him, who careth for us: and then sing with the Psalmist, <HI>The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.</HI></P>
<P>USE IV. Here we see the <HI>solid Ground of Con∣solation which we have respecting our departed Friends, who we have good Reason to hope, sleep in Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>Their Death is gain. God takes not his Children out of this World, until he prepares them for that better Country, which is an heavenly. When they are absent from the Body, they are present with the Lord, and go to be with Christ.</P>
<P>Let this then comfort us under the sorrowful Be∣reavements of those <HI>worthy Persons,</HI> who were car∣ried to their Tombs the last Week.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. DANIEL GREENLEAF, and Mrs. MARTHA BRATTLE, late Consort of the honourable WILLIAM BRATTLE, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> were buried in the same Week.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="009513_0018_0F758B83A8F14ED8"/>Let what has been said, <HI>direct and comfort this Church and Congregation. under the heavy Stroke of God's Hand, in the Death of our late worthy Pastor, the Rev. Mr.</HI> ALEXANDER CUMMING. He was truly of this Spirit, and might adopt the Words of the Apostle in a good Degree; <HI>For me to live, is Christ.</HI> We have abundant Reason to be∣lieve, that he received Christ into his Heart, as his Lord and Redeemer: And it was the Spirit of his Ministry, to shew us our Sin and Misery by the Fall, and to lead us unto Christ, as the Lord our Righte∣ousness, for our Justification before God; and as our Head of Influence, of whose Fulness we must re∣ceive Grace to live to God, and perform vital Acts of new Obedience.</P>
<P>He was an able Minister of the New Testament, endow'd with rich Gifts from our ascended Saviour. He was an hard Student, an excellent Scholar; and a Scribe well instructed to the Kingdom of Heaven. It is true, his lively active Soul, dwelt in a crazy feeble Body: however, under his bodily Weakness, he did willingly spend, and was spent in his Lord's Work. —He was a <HI>Man of Prayer;</HI> and in his Addresses to that God. who is the high and <HI>losty One,</HI> he lay low under an abasing Sense of our Meanness and Vile∣ness, and well express'd his entire Dependance on the Merits and Intercession of Jesus, our <HI>Advocate</HI> with the Father.</P>
<P>He shew'd his esteem and <HI>value for these Churches,</HI> and for the Doctrines of Grace exhibited in their <HI>Confession of Faith.</HI></P>
<P>This Man of God was a <HI>burning and shining Light,</HI> who not only preach'd, but liv'd the Gospel, holding forth the Light of it in a Conversation becoming the Doctrines and Precepts of our holy Religion.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="009513_0019_0F758B840D9B0458"/>He shew'd his Zeal for the Lord of Hosts, and against the prevailing Errors and Corruptions of the Times wherein he lived.</P>
<P>He followed Christ, bearing the Cross; and under Returns of distressing Pain, shew'd his Patience and reverend Submission to the Will of his heavenly Fa∣ther.—And altho' a sovereign God took him from us in the midst of his Days; yet he express'd himself to me, as desirous rather to die, than live; and to ano∣ther, his Hope and Trust in Christ. But his Pain was so great, there was not that Opportunity to Dis∣course with him, which was to be desired.</P>
<P>However, from my own Knowledge, and the Testi∣mony of others. I am satisfied, that he was a close Walker with God; and now rests from his Labours and Sufferings in the heavenly Paradice.</P>
<P>He has left a sorrowful Widow, soon after Marriage, mourning for the Hussband of her Youth. May she be espoused to Christ, who is fairer than the Children of Men; and have that good Word spo∣ken to her. <HI>The Maker is thy Husband,—</HI> And may we all hear the Voice of God in this awful Providence! 1 Cor. vii. 29—31. — <HI>Brethren, the Time is short. It remaineth that both they that have Wives be as though they had none; and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that re∣joyce, as though they rejoyced not; and they that buy as though they possessed not; and they that use this World, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this World passeth away.</HI></P>
<P>And as we of this Flock, have a <HI>peculiar Share</HI> in the <HI>public Loss</HI> sustained by the Death of this ex∣cellent Person; may we humble our selves before
<PB N="18" REF="009513_0020_0F758B84E6697F00"/>
God, and duly resent his correcting Hand, stretched out against us, and make a wise Improvement of it.</P>
<P>May such as have not yet been perswaded to close with Christ, who saves from Sin, the Sting of Death; now hear the loud Calls of God's Word and Rod; and fly for Refuge to lay hold on the <HI>Hope</HI> set before them in Him, who hath <HI>abolished</HI> Death, and <HI>hath brought Life &amp; Immortality to Light thro'the Gospel.</HI> O cry for the Holy Spirit, that you may turn at his Reproof, who said, <HI>My Spirit shall not always strive with Man:</HI> Lest that awful Threat'ning be fulfilled in you, Jer. vi. 29, 30. <HI>The Bellows are burned, the Lead is consumed of the Fire, the Founder melteth in vain; for the Wicked are not plucked away. Re∣probate Silver shall Men call them, because the Lord hath rejected them.</HI>— May such as are in the <HI>middle of Life,</HI> take heed least the Cares and Business of this short Life, should hinder them from minding the one Thing needful, and choosing the <HI>good Part,</HI> which shall not be taken away—May <HI>God's Children</HI> awake and trim their Lamps, and stand as they that wait for the coming of their Lord — May the <HI>Ministers of Christ,</HI> hear the Voice of God, and be excited to work the Works of him that sent them, while it is Day; the Night cometh when no Man can work.— And in par∣ticular, may the <HI>Associated Pastors</HI> in this Town, now that God has taken away the youngest of of them by Death; be quickened to watch for Souls, as those that must give an Account; and double their Diligence in their Lords Work.—And now, that God again alarms us, by the sudden Seisure of his Servant, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The Rev.

<P>And now, may your <HI>aged Pastor,</HI> who has lived to bury three <HI>worthy Colleagues,</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. EBENEZER PEMBERTON, who died <HI>Feb.</HI> 13. 1717.

<P>And may the Father of Lights, from whom every good Gift, and every perfect Gift cometh down; close this <HI>wide Breach</HI> in his due Time, with another able and faithful Pastor: and be the Repairer of <HI>every Breach</HI> he has made upon us.—The Lord help us to wait upon Him, in a diligent observance of the Rules of his Word; keeping the Unity of the Spirit, in the Bond of Peace.—And thus let us encourage ourselves in the Lord, who hath said, <HI>Because I live, ye shall live also.</HI></P>
<P>And may we now, so shew forth the Lord's Death at his Table, as to be prepar'd for our own.—May we by Faith feed on Christ, the Bread of Life, who hath said, <HI>Whoso eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood, hath eternal Life, and I will raise him up at the last Day.</HI> I conclude with those Words, 1 Thess. iv.13—18. <HI>I would not have you to be igno∣rant,

Brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope. For if ye believe that Jesus died, and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus, will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the Word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a Shout with the Voice of the Archangel, and with the Trump of God: and the Dead in Christ shall rise first: Then we which are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the Clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air; and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these Words.</HI></P>

<HEAD>From the <HI>Massachusetts Gazette,</HI> &amp;c. Of <HI>September</HI> 1. 1763. <HI>By another Hand.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Boston,</HI> <DATE><HI>August</HI> 30. 1763.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ON Thursday the 25th of this Instant died, in the thirty-seventh Year of his Age, the Reverend Mr. ALEXANDER CUMMING, one of the Pastors of the South Church in this Town; to the Grief of all who were acquainted with his just Character.</P>
<P>THE Father of Spirits was pleas'd to form him with superior intellectual Abilities: His Apprehension was quick and piercing; his Imagination lively and fruitful; his judgment accurate and solid.</P>
<P>THESE Gifts of Nature were greatly improved by close Thought and diligent Study; and, being sanctified by divine Grace, were employed to promote the Interests of Religion.</P>
<P>HE early devoted himself to the Service of the Sanctu∣ary, and in his public Performances you might discern the Marks of a strong Mind.—It was easy to him to write on Points that to others were intricate and abstruse; this might lead him to frequent Discourses on such Sub∣jects: but even in these, there were the evident Traces of a serious Spirit, deeply impressed with the great and important Truths of Religion.</P>
<P>His practical Discourses were clear, animated and ju∣dicious; they evidenced that he was himself well ac∣quainted with the Christian Temper, and being delivered with a grave and striking Elocution, they were adapted to reach and better the Hearts of his Hearers.</P>
<P><PB REF="009513_0024_0F758B87CECF8CB8"/>HIS Conversation was amiable and useful, He was serious without Affectation, and affable without Levity or Meanness. You saw at once the polite Gentleman, the fair Reasoner, the accomplish'd Divine, and the exem∣plary Christian.</P>
<P>THOUGH he wanted not Sensibility, he had a great command of his Passions, not easily ruffled in his Tem∣per, or betrayed to rashness in his Expressions; knowing how to be firm and resolved, without losing the compo∣sure of his Mind, or the gentleness of his Manners.</P>
<P>HONESTY and uprightness were distinguishing Parts of his Character; He was a Stranger to Dissimulation him∣self, and abhor'd it in others.</P>
<P>HIS Religion was pure and substantial; free from the Follies of Superstition, or the Reveries of Enthusiasm.</P>
<P>HIS Constitution, naturally tender, was severely tried with frequent Paroxisms of Pain, which were of a threat∣ning Aspect; he bore these with Christian Patience: When in moderate Health, he was a pleasant Companion, and went through the Duties of his Station with Diligence and Chearfulness.</P>
<P>HIS last Illness came upon him with such Violence, as exhausted his Spirits, and rendered him incapable of say∣ing much to his Friends. He continued however in full Possession of himself, till just before he expired, and spake of his Departure with calmness and Serenity. He was willing to die, tho' he had almost every earthly Induce∣ment to make him desirous of living—He knew in whom he had believed, and expressed his firm Reliance on the Merits of the compassionate Redeemer of Men. He met the Approaches of Death, like one who believed and hoped for Immortality.</P>
<P>HIS Removal is a Loss to the Public—It peculiarly affects the Church and Congregation to whom he mini∣ster'd: They with Pleasure beheld him serving as a Son with the venerable Dr. SEWALL, who having obtain'd help from GOD still survives, to lead and comfort them under this melancholy Bereavement.</P>
<P>MR. CUMMING'S Remains were interred Yesterday, with every Mark of Respect.</P>
