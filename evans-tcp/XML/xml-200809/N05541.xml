<P>THE Commissioners being seated at a large Table near the Fort, attended by a Number of Gentlemen and others, Spectators: And some of the Chiefs and other of the <HI>Penobscott</HI> Tribe of Indians, being seated over against the Commissioners. After the usual Salutati∣ons had passed.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Joseph Bean</HI> was sworn to the faithful Discharge of the Trust of an Interpreter at this present Conference, And,</P>

<P><PB N="4" REF="007025_0003_102AEBB96D6BD2A8"/>
After which, Sir <HI>William Pepperrell,</HI> in the Name of the Commissioners, spake to the Indians as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friends and Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>GOvernor SHIRLEY, who is lately returned to his Government, would have met You in Person at this Conserence; but his Stay Abroad hath been so long, that it would have been a Disservice to Him, as well as the Province, to have been here himself; but he hath done us the Honour of a Commission, and thereby hath given us full Power to appear and act in Behalf of the Government.</P>
<P>Through the Favour of divine Providence we have been preserved in our Voyage hither, and are very glad of this Opportunity of seeing so great a Number of you at this Interview, and desire to know what Tribes you represent, and with what Power you do appear.</P>
<P>The last Treaty with you (we trust) hath been kept sacred &amp; inviolate on our Part, and in some Respects we have exceeded our Engagements, particularly as to your Trade with us, wherein you have had those Advantages which none before you have enjoyed; and that your Hunting might be better secured to you, the Government (on the Return of the Commissioners the last Year) immediately came into an Act, forbidding any Encroachments on your Game, under very severe Pe∣nalties, and doubt not but you have before now reaped the happy Effects of it; and besides this, have removed <HI>Hall</HI> from <HI>Montinicus,</HI> whom you then complained of as interrupting you in your Fishing and Fowling.</P>
<P>We rejoice in the happy Effects of the Peace and Friendship subsisting between us, and hope that any Attemps to violate the same will have no Impression upon you; but that we may open our Minds freely to each other, shall now proceed to a Conference with you, in which we have Nothing new to offer, but to renew and confirm our former Treaty (which is the same as that formerly agreed on between you and Governor DUMMER) that so the Chain of Peace and Friendship subsisting between us may become brighter and brighter; and to receive any Proposals from you for this End, if you have them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P></Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissioners.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you now give an Answer to what we have said to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Abenquit,</HI> Speaker.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will Answer you presently.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Commissioners withdrew into the Fort, and in half an Hour after returned. When,</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="007025_0004_102AEBBAF92D9E78"/>
<HI>Abenquit,</HI> In the Name of the Rest of the <HI>Penobscott</HI> Tribe, spake as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>WE are well pleased to see you here, and that GOD has pre∣served you in your Voyage, and brought you in safety to this Place.</P>
<P>We like what Governor DUMMER did, and also what was done by Governor SHIRLEY; and we will stand to what our Sachems then did. I came from <HI>Penobscot,</HI> and was impowered to do what was Right. No Man shall prevent the happy Union subsisting between us; the several Treaties we have now with us we will stand by, and are ready to Ratify. And,</P>
<P>Then delivered the Commissioners the Treaty of Peace made and renewed in the Year 1749. And the Ratification thereof made the last Year: Which the Commissioners ordered to be returned them. Which was done accordingly.</P></Q>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>How came you by these Treaties; and from whom did you receive them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our Tribe ordered us to bring them to be ratified and confirmed.</P>
<P>We give our Service to Governor SHIRLEY, and to the Great Council of the Province.</P>
<P>It is very good in them to send you here, what is done we like well; on our Part we will do every Thing that Peace and Friendship may continue among us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you appear, and what Tribes do you represent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are impowred by the <HI>Penobscott</HI> Tribe; and appear for them only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are not so many of your Tribe here present as there were two Years ago: Where are the Rest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Rest are gone to <HI>Canada</HI> upon their own private Busi∣ness; but we are fully impowered to act for them; and it is the same as if they were all here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is your whole Tribe satisfied with every Article of the former Treaty; and are you impowred to agree for them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we were not, we should not have been here; nor have brought the Treaties with us.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007025_0005_102AEBBD375150E0"/>
We would say something relating to our Minister: Has not our Priest wrote a Letter to Governor SHIRLEY? We desire a Copy of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has any Body said or done any Thing to you to create Jealousies in your Mind against the <HI>English</HI>? If they have, we desire you would freely mention it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>He that is a Man will hide Nothing; so we will speak our Minds freely to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Abenquit.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope all that has been said pleases you; We like it and so will all the Rest of our Tribe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why are not the <HI>Norridgawocks</HI> here as usual?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not the <HI>Norridgawocks</HI> write to Governor SHIRLEY last Summer, not to come down yet; but to deter his coming some Time later?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't the <HI>Norridgawocks</HI> expect the Commissioners down this Year?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: They do expect them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you seen any of the <HI>Norridgawocks</HI> lately?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have not; but our Priest has.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has your Priest been to <HI>Norridgawock</HI>?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: He has; and asked us what we waited for here; he told us you would not come down, and tryed what he could to prevent our waiting any longer for you, or treating with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>We intend to go to <HI>Richmond,</HI> to Treat with the <HI>Norridga∣wocks</HI>; but you being the principal Tribe, we came here first.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then the Commissioners told the Indians, that they had some Tokens of Friendship from the Government; which according to their Promise made them the last Year, would be renewed to them Yearly, so long as they kept the PEACE sacred and inviolate.</P>
<P>Then the Commissioners drank King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Health; which was pledg'd by the Indians.</P>
<P>And then the Conference was adjourned 'till To-Morrow Morning Nine o'Clock.</P>

<P>The Commissioners and Indians being met.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>WE are glad to see you this Morning in good Health; and are ready to hear what you have further to offer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have something to say to you with Respect to the Trade and Beaver.</P>
<P>Beaver is now very good, and will be so two Weeks hence; two Sabbath Days hence Beaver will be as good as when catch'd under the ice. The young Men want to know when Beaver is good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beaver always speaks for it self: You may be sure to have the full Worth of your Beaver according to its Goodness, at whatever Time of the Year it is catch'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>What will Beaver be about two Week's hence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever it will fetch at <HI>Boston,</HI> We will give you:</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>The Government are determined to treat you with the strictest Justice, and the greatest Kindness: And if you will attend to the fol∣lowing Particulars, you must be convinced of it.</P>
<P>You give no more for what you buy at the Truck House, than the same Articles be bought for with ready Money at <HI>Boston:</HI> Strouds last Year were £. 70. a Piece, now are but £. 60. In Governor DUMMER'S Time, Rum was sold you at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a Gallon; and Beaver was then sold for 8<HI>s.</HI> a Pound▪ Rum is now but 10<HI>s.</HI> a Gallon, but Beaver is 40<HI>s</HI> a Pound; so that you gain more than a Quarter Part: You have more now for four Shillings, than formerly you had for five Shillings; and this is the Case with almost every Thing else, excepting Wampum. Fall Beaver in Governor DUMMER'S Time was but 6<HI>s.</HI> a Pound, now it is 25<HI>s.</HI> Stage Beaver then was 4<HI>s.</HI> a Pound, now it is 15<HI>s.</HI> Then you had not a Bushel of Corn for an Otter, now you have a Bushel &amp; an half.</P></Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We want to have Wampum as it was formerly; it is now dearer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Article is dearer we acknowledge; but we are so far from making any Advantage by it, that we send for it to <HI>New York,</HI> and purchase it with Dollars: Are at all this Trouble, and yet sell it to you exactly as it cost us, without the least Advance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="007025_0007_102AEBC1A3DF7CA8"/>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was the Price of Spring Beaver formerly? And in what Proportion to other Things.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spring Beaver was then 8<HI>s.</HI> a Pound, and Corn 6<HI>s.</HI> a Bushel; Spring Beaver is now 40<HI>s.</HI> a Pound, and Corn but 28<HI>s.</HI> a Bushel. In Gover∣nor DUMMER'S Time we gave you but eight Gallons of Rum for five Pound of Spring Beaver; now for the same Quantity of Beaver we give you upwards of twelve Gallons: You have Rum at the Truck House twelve Pence a Quart cheaper than you can buy it with your Money at <HI>Boston</HI> by Retail.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q>The Government will supply you with what you want; and have brought every Thing to the very lowest Price, as cheap by Retail as you could purchase by Wholesale; and give you for your Beaver and Skins as they are sold at <HI>Boston.</HI> The firm Resolution of the Government is to make no Advantage of this Trade with you; they are determined to supply you cheaper than the <HI>French</HI> can or will do: And in every Instance of our Treatment of you, you must be convinced that we seek your Interest more than the <HI>French</HI> do, notwithstanding the base Methods they take to persuade you to the contrary.</Q>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is sometimes a Scarcity in the Truck-House: We would have it always supplied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes there is a Scarcity in <HI>Boston</HI>; but when that is not the Case, you may depend upon a full Supply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>Capt. <HI>Bradbury,</HI> and Lieut. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> are very good Men, We like them well, and desire they may be encouraged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are glad to hear it; the Government will always take Care to get the best Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mechias</HI> Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We live a great Ways from the Truck-House: We would have a Sloop with Goods sent down to <HI>Passamaquody.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>As some Indians have done Mischief that Way, it will not be safe to send one there, unless it is covered with a Fort: If you in Behalf of that Tribe are impowred to make this Proposal, We will upon our Return lay it before the Government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Mechias</HI> Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will let that Matter drop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Government has sent us here, to hear any Grievances you may labour under, that the same may be redressed; and to do every Thing we can for your best Good and Interest.</P>

<P>Have you any Thing at present further to offer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissioners.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Friends and Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>WHEN we met you in Conference Yesterday, we were in Expecta∣tion of seeing the <HI>Norridgawocks</HI> at this Place also; but as they do not appear, we would remind you of one Article stipulated and confirmed the last Year, which hath not been complied withal; We mean the Return of our Captives.</P>
<P>Altho' we do not immediately charge YOU of this Tribe with this Neglect, yet you can't but remember the Commissioners were assured the last Year, that the Parents who had their Children then in Captivity might rest satisfied, that they should be returned them in the Spring following, at furthest; And as this Promise was made by the <HI>Norridga∣wocks</HI> when you were present, you engaged that you would endeavour that the several Articles of Peace then renewed (of which this was one) should be complied with by the <HI>Norridgawocks,</HI> as well as your selves; yet we must inform you, that after all Attempts for their Redemption, Nothing is done; but the Children still remain in the Hands of the <HI>French,</HI> altho' their Parents have since been at the Expence and Trouble of making a tedious Journey to <HI>Canada</HI> for that Purpose.</P>
<P>You find that the <HI>English</HI> have faithfully fulfill'd all their Promises with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and therefore justly expect the like Return from you; and in Consequence hereof, that you use your best Endeavours that all our Captives may be forthwith restored, that so there may be no further Reason for Complaint on this Account.</P>
<P>You informed us Yesterday that your Minister had been attempting to prejudice you against the <HI>English,</HI> insinuating that there would soon be a War between the two Nations; and thereby would (if possible) have pre∣vented your meeting the Commissioners at this Time; but that you was jealous of him, and believed him not to be a good Man, because he had wrote to Governor SHIRLEY (as you were informed) on this Head. To which we reply, That it is absolutely false and without the least Foun∣dation; for we do assure you, that there is at this Time a good Harmony subsisting between the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King.</P>
<P>The Government of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> are fully sensible of the Artifices used by the <HI>French</HI> to raise Jealousies and create Misunderstand∣ings between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Indians,</HI> and of the Methods the <HI>French</HI> use to defeat the Measures the <HI>English</HI> take for maintaining Peace and good Friendship: But as a Proof of our Sincerity, Governor SHIRLEY, 
<PB N="10" REF="007025_0009_102AEBC592E864A0"/>
from a tender Regard to your Welfare, and to prevent your being any further imposed upon by them, has sent you a Letter by us, which we have Orders to have first interpreted, and then delivered you; as also another Letter which he received from the <HI>French</HI> Jesuit (<HI>Pierre Gounon</HI>) your present Minister; by which you will see, he is not in the least to be regarded, much less depended upon; and after such clear and evident Demonstrations of Friendship on our Side to you, in the foregoing In∣stances, and our fulfilling our former Engagements of making you an annual Present as long as you should continue in Amity with us, which we have hitherto done, and our being present at this Time to destribute the same for this Year: We say, after so many Instances of Sincerity and Friendship from us, it will discover a base and disingenuous Spirit in you, not to resent all the Artifices and Tricks of the <HI>French</HI> (in whom there is no Trust) and maintain a constant Friendship with the <HI>English,</HI> who have always been your steady Friends; in which we apprehend your real Interest doth consist.</P></Q>
</SP>
<P>Then the Letter from Governor SHIRLEY to the <HI>Penobscott</HI> Indians, and also the Letter from the <HI>French</HI> Jesuit to Governor SHIRLEY were distinctly read, interpreted and delivered to them.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this Letter it is evident, that your Jesuit makes no more of you than if you were a Parcel of Misqueters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must mind him no more than Trash.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our Ministers preach Peace, and advise us to live in Peace with you, and are Men of Truth. Shall the Government send such a One to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you any Thing further to say?</P>
</SP>
<P>The Indians making no Answer.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you now ready to confirm the Peace as renewed at <HI>Falmouth</HI> in 1749. and ratified and confirmed the last Year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are ready to ratify and confirm the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are some Indians at <HI>Mechias</HI> and <HI>Passamaquody,</HI> and what we say binds them equally with us.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then the Commissioners informed the Indians, that they would meet them again in the Afternoon, in order to sign the Ratification of the Articles of PEACE, and deliver the Presents ordered them by the Government.</P>
<P>The Commissioners then drank King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Health, as also Governor SHIRLEY'S; and a lasting PEACE. Which were pledg'd by the Indians.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">

<HEAD>Post Meridiem.</HEAD>
<P>The Commissioners and Indians being again met.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>HAVE you considered of what we said in the Forenoon, relating to the Captives? We are sorry the Promise made by the <HI>Norridgawocks</HI> was not inforced by you: Such is your Weight and Authority with them, that had you used your best Endeavours for their Redemption, it would have been effected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We wish to do that which is Good and Right, and we will try whatever we can that they may be returned, but we cannot do any more than we can do: This we further Promise, that if they are not returned some Time this Fall, we will go after them, and endeavour to Redeem them: All the Captives WE took have been returned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>According to your Promise we now expect you use your utmost Endeavours for the Redemption of these unhappy Captives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We rejoice; all our young Men rejoice, and the Rest of our Tribe, when they hear of what we have now done, will also rejoice at it:—We are ready to confirm all the Treaties we delivered you to brighten the Chain, and wish that the Peace may continue forever.</P>
<P>Our Thoughts are much upon our Minister, and his deceiving us; but as we don't mind him, we hope you will not.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then upwards of thirty of the Chiefs and others of the <HI>Penobscott</HI> Tribes, Signed Sealed &amp; Delivered to the Commissioners the Ratification of the Articles of Peace made and concluded on at <HI>Falmouth</HI> in <HI>Casco-Bay,</HI> in the Year 1749. After which,</P>
<P>The Commissioners acquainted the Indians they were ready to deliver them the Presents ordered to be given them by the Government. Which was done accordingly. For which the Indians exprest great Thankfulness, and desired Liberty that their young Men might express their good Liking to what had been now done, by having a Dance in Presence of the Commissioners. After their Dance was finished,</P>
<P>The Commissioners drank King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Health, wishing that the Peace now ratified might continue as long as the Sun and Moon shall endure.</P>
<P>Then the Commissioners went on Board the Sloop in order to proceed to <HI>Richmond,</HI> to meet the <HI>Norridgawock</HI> Tribe of Indians.</P>

<P>The Indians were informed that an Oath would be administred to Mr. <HI>Walter Mc'Farland,</HI> truly to interpret what should pass between the Commissioners and the Indians at this Conference; and also an Oath to Mr. <HI>Ezekiel Price,</HI> faithfully to discharge the Trust of Clerk to the Com∣missioners. Which Oaths were accordingly administred.</P>
<P>Then Sir <HI>William Pepperre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> in the Name of the Commissioners, spake as follows.</P>
<P><HI>Friends and Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>THE Reason of Governor SHIRLEY's not meeting You in Person this Year, is, his having been so long Absent from his Go∣vernment; and the Affairs of it at present not allowing Him to be here; We that are present, appear by his Order and Commission, and come fully authorized and impowred to treat with you.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="007025_0012_102AEBCB338BE470"/>
We are fully sensible of the Attempts the <HI>French</HI> by Means of their Missionaries among you, have been making from Time to Time, in order to create Jealousies and Misunderstandings between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI>; and that <HI>Pierre Gounon,</HI> the Father of the <HI>Penobscotts,</HI> hath lately been here, and would, if possible, have prevented your Attendance at this Conference, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he would have done the <HI>Penobscotts</HI> at St. <HI>George</HI>'s; notwithstanding which, they readily met the Commissioners there, were pleased with that Interview; and we hope that you will take the Advice the <HI>Penobscotts</HI> gave the Commissioners the last Week, not to mind him; that their Thoughts run much on him, and his deceiving them; and hoped that we would not regard him any more than <HI>they</HI> did, which was no more than Trash: And we are well satisfied that before we Part, we shall produce such Evidence of his Treachery, as shall convince you that he is a false Man; and that it will not be for your Credit to regard him, or what he says: But on the contrary, it will be your Interest to regard the <HI>English</HI> more than the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>If we look into the last Treaty, we shall find, that three Articles were more especially the Subject of it, namely Trade, our Captives, and our Lands.</P>
<P>As for Trade, we need only observe to you, That the Government have given Orders to the several Truck-Masters, to supply you with Goods at a cheaper Rate than they were obliged to do; and as the <HI>English</HI> can furnish you with them at a lower Price than the <HI>French</HI>; We do assure you that it is the Determination of the Government, that they will.</P>
<P>As for our Friends in Captivity; We must remind you of your solemn Engagements to the Commissioners, that they should be return'd by the last Spring at furthest; but they still remain in the Hands of the <HI>French:</HI> This Conduct of yours, is base and unjust, and as such, deserves the highest Resentments; and therefore, after all your Promises, We now demand of you the Reason why they are not returned? And unless you give us some satisfactory Account hereof, we must plainly tell you, that you have not fulfilled your Engagements; and that if they are not forth∣with restored, we must look upon it as a Violation of the Ratification of Peace the last Year.</P>
<P>The Government according to their Promise, have considered your Complaints of the last Year, relating to some <HI>English</HI> Settlements making on <HI>Kennebeck-River,</HI> and were in hopes that what they had wrote you on this Head, would have been to Satisfaction; but if it is not, we trust that in the Course of this Conference, we shall offer you such Evidence of our Claim to those Lands, as shall convince you that we have not done you any Injustice in what we have done; nor so much as design∣ed it.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="007025_0013_102AEBCDE56CA0A0"/>
When we have gone through these Articles, and renewed the Peace ratified the last Year, and given you the Presents designed you by the Government; we know of Nothing that will prevent our speedy return to our several Homes; unless you have something new to offer, which, if you have, we shall give it its due Weight and Consideration; but as we have been so long from Home, we must insist on the greatest Dispatch.</P></Q>

<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you ready to Answer what we have now said to you?</P>

<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will answer you presently.</P>

<P>The Commissioners then acquainted the Indians they had a Letter from Governor SHIRLEY to them, which he had ordered should be in∣terpreted and then delivered them. Which was done accordingly. And also a Copy of the Letter sent Governor SHIRLEY by <HI>Pierre Gounon,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Jesuit at <HI>Penobscott</HI>; which was also interpreted, and then deli∣vered them. And at the same Time the Jesuits original Letter to Go∣vernor SHIRLEY was shown to the Indians.</P>

<SPEAKER>Quenois, Speaker.</SPEAKER>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>WE have thought of the Words spoken to us in the Morning, and look upon what you then said as if the Governor was present and spake himself.</P>
<P>We thank you for reading and interpreting to us the Jesuit's Letter. We know the Hearts of all the Indians hereabouts, and of some now present, who are lately come from <HI>Canada,</HI> and all our Hearts are good.</P>
<P>We know the <HI>Penobscotts</HI> love Peace, and we as well as they love Peace, and will hold fast to it.</P>
<P>All the Gentlemen of the <HI>Norridgawock</HI> Tribe are here present.</P>
<P><HI>Toxus</HI> is an old Man, and we believe will never be here.</P>
<P>Do not mind any Thing the Jesuit says, we know it is Peace all over the World. We want no Jesuits to meddle with Treaties. All we want of them is to pray with us, and take Care of our Souls. If any of our Jesuits should write any Thing concerning us, or Peace or War, if you will inform us of it, we will let you know whether it is true or false.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="007025_0014_102AEBCF6F77CB60"/>
What this <HI>Penobscott</HI> Jesuit wrote is a Lye. We do not want War. We desire to live in Peace. All that he has said is false.</P>
<P>We have done with that Article.</P></Q>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hath not the Jesuit been endeavouring to make Mischief between you and us, and to prevent your coming to this Conference?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quenois,</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Friends and Brethren,</HI></P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>I would speak further to you:</P>
<P>Here is a River belonging to us? You have lately built a new Garrison here: we with you would be content to go no further up the River than that Fort.</P>
<P>Governor DUMMER's Talk was very good, we like it well.</P>
<P>Governor DUDLEY and Governor DUMMER, both told us that no Settlement should be made above <HI>Richmond</HI> Fort: The Fashion is, if the Governor don't like any Thing, to tell the Indians of it; and for the In∣dians to do the same to him.</P>
<P>We live wholly by this Land, and live but poorly; the <HI>Penobscotts</HI> hunt on one Side of us, and the <HI>Canada</HI> Indians on the other Side; there∣fore do not turn us off this Land. We are willing you should enjoy all the Lands from the New-Fort, and so downwards.</P>
<P>We are done as to the Lands. We will now speak as to the Captives.</P>
<P>We heard that Mr. <HI>Noble,</HI> Father of the Children, was gone to <HI>Canada</HI> to fetch them.</P>
<P>Here are <HI>Passaguerent,</HI> and <HI>Neudegawaremes,</HI> two Indians that went to <HI>Canada</HI> for a Fryar, and to carry the Belt of Wampum from the Go∣vernor to the <HI>Arrasagonticooks.</HI></P>
<P>That Tribe as well we rejoice to hear there is Peace all over the World, and that the Land is now smooth.</P>
<P>One of the Captives is at the Village of <HI>Werenock,</HI> the others are at <HI>Arrasagonticook.</HI></P></Q>

<SPEAKER><HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nois.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>The Reason I did not go was because I broke my Arm; the Journey is very great, and I could not Paddle. It was not worth while for twenty to go.</P>

<P>You promised to notify Capt. <HI>Lithgow</HI>? Why did not you do it?</P>

<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are mistaken, it was the middle of Summer. Be∣sides, Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> saw <HI>Mitchel</HI>'s Son at <HI>Montreal.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quenois.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why did he not bring him Home when he saw him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Governor said, you had sold them to the <HI>French</HI>▪ and he would not let the Fathers of the Children bring them away for Money; nor let them go to <HI>Arrasagonticook,</HI> to fetch those that were there.</P>
<P>One of the Articles of the last Treaty, and upon which we greatly relied, was, the solemn Promises you then made us touching the Return of the Captives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say there is Peace between the two Crowns. How could the <HI>French</HI> Governor detain them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps he expected that you who put them into their Hands, should take them out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>If <HI>Sebastine</HI> was here, we should be glad; he is a Man of Influence, he belongs to the <HI>Arrasagonticook</HI> Tribe; we believe he would fetch them in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>speaking to <HI>Quenois.</HI> You promised last Year to go for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quenois.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you before, I broke my Arm last <HI>April.</HI></P>

<P>Is it not well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quenois.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: It is not well yet.</P>

<P>If you was not able to go yourself; why did not some other of your Tribe go?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> went, and we thought he would have brought them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this complying with your Promise? When the <HI>English</HI> Promise, they religiously comply with it; they promised the last Year that your Complaints should be redressed respecting the <HI>English</HI> hunting on your Ground, and taking your Game; immediately upon the Great Courts sitting after their Return, a Law was made to prevent it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, we made a Promise to fetch in the Captives; there is but little Water now, we tho't they were returned. We are now going upon our Hunting, but in the Spring we will go to <HI>Canada,</HI> and talk with the <HI>French</HI> Governor, and do what we can to bring them in.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="007025_0016_102AEBD36707BEB8"/>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you sell them to the <HI>French?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indian.</SPEAKER>
<P>We did not sell them; it was the <HI>Arrasagonticook</HI>'s that sold them.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then the Commissioners read to them the Conference of last Year respecting the Captives, and <HI>Quenois</HI>'s Answer, wherein he owned that he was at <HI>Swan-Island</HI> when <HI>Noble's</HI> Children were taken.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quenois.</SPEAKER>
<P>I deny that I said I was at <HI>Swan-Island</HI>; I said that I was no nearer than <HI>Richmond.</HI> If I said that I was there, I did not speak true, I was drunk.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Passaguerent</HI> said that he and <HI>Quenois</HI> were on the other Side the River, at <HI>Richmond,</HI> when the Children were taken, and not on the Island.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>Agreable to our Promise the last Year, we acquainted the Government of the three Things you then complained of. The first was with Respect to the Price of Goods, which you have cheaper now than in Governor DUMMER's Time. The second was relating to one <HI>Hall</HI> and his Family, living at <HI>Montinicus,</HI> who you complained of as spoiling your Hunting; and he has since been removed by Order of the Government. The other was, that several Englishmen from the Westward had frequently hunted on your Lands to the spoiling of your Game: The Government hath since made a Law to forbid any Persons hunting there under very severe Penalties. So that you see the three Things the <HI>Penobscotts</HI> and you complained of are redressed; and as the <HI>English</HI> have been as good as their Word to you, we expect the like from you; and that by next Spring, according to your present Promise, you go after the Captives, and bring them in; otherwise we shall look upon it that you intend to break the Peace now subsisting between us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Passaguerent.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the Spring we will go, I myself will go: We will get them in, if possible? If I can get but one, I will bring him in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>You promise fair, and we depend upon your faithful Per∣formance of it.</P>
<P>We will now say something to you concerning the Lands.</P>
<P>By the Treaties made in Governor SHUTE'S and in Governor DUM∣MER'S Time, the <HI>English</HI> were allowed to have all the Lands that they had purchased or possessed.</P>
<P>Then that Part of Governor SHUTE'S Treaty which related to the Lands, was read and interpreted to the Indians; as also, that in Gover∣nor DUMMER'S.</P>

<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>You made the same Complaints respecting your Lands at the Treaty with Governor DUMMER, as you do now.</P>
<P>Are you not sensible that these Lands were sold to the <HI>English</HI> by your Ancestors, and fairly purchased by them?</P>
</SP>

<P>We have never heard from our old Men, that our Fore∣fathers ever sold any of these Lands.</P>

<P>We shall be glad to see the Deeds, and to know the Names of the Indians that sold these Lands.</P>

<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>By ancient trading Houses up this River, by ancient Settle∣ments, and by the ancient Deeds now produced and shown you, you must be convinced that these Lands belong to us: And we now hope, that in the Settlement of them, we shall live like Brethren and Friends.</P>

<P>We will inform the Relations and Friends to the Owners of these Lands of what has been said.</P>

<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>WE are glad to see you this Morning, and hope you are all well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>We told you Yesterday that all the Land on both Sides <HI>Kennebeck-River</HI> as high up as <HI>Wasserunsick</HI> belonged to the <HI>English,</HI> they having bought it of the Indians; your Forefathers many Years ago sold them to the <HI>English,</HI> as appears by the Deeds we then produced to you, which Deeds you then appeared fully satisfied with, as you knew by Tradition most of the Names of the Indians who signed them.</P>
<P>In Consequence of these Purchases, the <HI>English</HI> took Possession of said Lands, and made Settlements upon them, and carried on a great Trade, particularly at <HI>Cushnoc</HI> and <HI>Teconnoc,</HI> where are now to be seen the Ruins of the <HI>English</HI> Houses.</P>
<P>Being convinced of this, and the <HI>English</HI> Right to said Land, you ceded them to the <HI>English</HI> by several Treaties formerly made, particularly by Governor SHUTE'S, and Governor DUMMER'S; and by other Treaties before their Time, which you have since confirmed.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> therefore have an undoubted Right to all the aforesaid Lands, and consequently have a Right to settle them whenever they think proper: And it is expected by this Government, after giving you this Satisfaction, that you do not disturb the <HI>English</HI> in any Settlements they are now about or may hereafter undertake on the Lands aforesaid: And we on our Part promise you, that you shall not be interrupted in your Hunting &amp; Fishing; to which Purpose a Law of this Government has been made since the last Treaty, at your Desire, forbidding under a very severe Penalty all the <HI>English</HI> from Hunting within said Lands, or giving you the least Interruption in that or any other Regard.</P>
<P>As to the Owners of these Lands, who you say are at <HI>Arrasagonticook,</HI> and elsewhere: We wish they were now here, that we might have an Opportunity of confering with them, and giving them the same Satis∣faction 
<PB N="20" REF="007025_0019_102AEBD9B87A82E8"/>
we have now given you: But we desire you to inform them with what we have now told you, and we make not the least Doubt, but that they will be entirely satisfied; especially as we have no Design to abridge them of the Liberty of Hunting and Fishing, which is the only Use, either they or you, make of the said Lands, and of the Waters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Quenois.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will say what we know about the Lands▪</P>
<P>These Governours, and General NICHOLSON, called the Indians into <HI>Piscataqua,</HI> and after a Treaty was made, they talked about the Lands.</P>
<P>General NICHOLSON said, they would bury all that was bad, and make the Land smooth.</P>
<P>The Indians desired the <HI>English</HI> might not settle further Eastward than <HI>Brunswick,</HI> which was then settled.</P>
<P>We were then bid, that if any Englishmen should settle further East∣ward than they had done, to inform the Governor of it, and they should pay dear for it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Penobscotts,</HI> and <HI>Arrasagonticooks,</HI> who were the Owners of the Land that Way, were at that Treaty, and talk'd about it.</P>
<P>The Governor then sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it would not hurt us if the <HI>English</HI> settled that Way: We mean at <HI>Brunswick, North-Yarmouth, Casco-Bay</HI> and <HI>Saco</HI>; and the Indians consented that it might be so.</P>
<P>Governor SHUTE had a Treaty at <HI>Arrowsick,</HI> and the Indians then told the <HI>English,</HI> they might go three Miles up this River.</P>
<P>Governor SHUTE said, it was not far enough. We were willing, and agreed that the <HI>English</HI> should go as far up the River as <HI>Richmond,</HI> and the Governor was glad of it, and liked it well.</P>
<P>What we have now said is what we have heard of former Times.</P>
<P><HI>Indians, Friends and Neighbours,</HI></P>
<P>We should be glad to be heard upon something further.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are ready to hear any Thing you have to say.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have seen Governor PHIPS'S Letter, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ys what is Right.</P>
<P>We have also seen Governor SHIRLEY'S Letter; we take it kindly of him; he writes in Love, and is for Peace; and we like it well.</P>
<P>There have been a great many Governors at <HI>Boston</HI>; we believe them to be all very Good</P>
<P>We have never heard that any of the Governors desired the <HI>English</HI> might settle higher up than <HI>Richmond</HI>; altho' we have heard it from other People.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="007025_0020_102AEBDB49D94938"/>
It would hurt us for you to settle higher up the River than the New-Fort: We are not against your going so far up, but are unwilling you should go any further up.</P>
<P>We have wrote twice upon this Matter to <HI>Boston,</HI> and now you hear it from our Mouths.</P>
<P>We hope you will think of what we have said as to the Land; we are willing you should settle all the Lands below the New-Fort, and hope you will go on in settling them with Courage and a good Spirit: You have Land enough below the New-Fort, without going any fur∣ther up.</P>
<P>We have told you our Hearts; we hope you will not settle any fur∣ther up the River; the Indians hunt on both Sides of us; we have but a little Space; we desire to live as Brothers.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>We desire to live in Peace with you, and like Brethren: We and you have always built on Governor DUMMER'S Treaty, and look'd upon it as a good one; by that Treaty, we are allowed to settle, where former Settlements have been made by the <HI>English,</HI> and to have all the Lands they have heretofore purchased of the Indians; and they were then freely given up and confirmed to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>All the Indians like Governor DUMMER'S Treaty very well.</P>
<P>We freely give Liberty to settle all the Lands below the New-Fort, but we want the Lands above for to Hunt upon, and get a Living by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>As your Forefathers sold these Lands to the <HI>English,</HI> and they were paid for by them; why are you against our settling them? The <HI>English</HI> have no Design to disturb you in your Hunting &amp; Fishing, but would always be glad to receive you into their Houses, and live peaceably with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Reason is, we get our Living on these Lands, and if the <HI>English</HI> should settle on them, it would drive away our Game; which has been the Case with Respect to the Lands between <HI>Richmond</HI> and the Sea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will appear plainly to any indifferent Judges, that we have fairly purchased these Lands from your Forefathers; and as we don't desire to abridge you of your Rights, so we expect you will not disturb us in ours.</P>
<P>Upon the whole of what you have said; you don't pretend to deny, but that the Purchases made by the <HI>English</HI> were fair and honest.</P>

<P>We don't think these Deeds are false; but we apprehend you got the Indians drunk, and so took the Advantage of them, when you bought the Lands.</P>
</SP>

<P>We should be glad to know how much Money was paid for these Lands. You say that you have bought them?</P>

<P>No doubt they had the full Value of them, the Deeds say so.</P>

<SPEAKER>Indians.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the Reason the Sum they were sold for, was not mentioned in the Deeds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was the Custom among the <HI>English</HI> in that Day not to mention any Sum; but he that sold the Land acknowledged he was satisfied and contented.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ongewasgone.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am an old Man, and never heard any of them say these Lands were sold.</P>

<SPEAKER>Commissi.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are fully satisfied these Lands were fairly purchased of the Indians: We desire you will enquire and search into it, and then we doubt not, but you will be satisfied of the Justice of our Claim; and that we shall live in Peace and like Brethren.</P>

<P>We expected that the <HI>Arrasagonticook</HI> Tribe of Indians would have been here, but as they are not, we would inform you, that if they will come to <HI>Richmond,</HI> and sign a Ratification of the aforesaid Articles of Peace, which we have left with Capt. <HI>Lithgow,</HI> they shall receive a Present from the Government; which shall be left with him for them.</P>

<P>We are well pleased with what you say. We are sensible of the mischievous Consequence, of your young Men's having too much Rum.</P>

<HEAD>His Excellency's LETTER to the <HI>Penobscott</HI> and <HI>Nor∣ridgawock</HI> Tribes of Indians, referred to in the fore∣going Conferences, is as follows.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Brethren of Penobscott and Norridgawock,</HI></P>
<P>AT my Return to my Government, I found Letters from you to Lieutenant Governor PHIPS, dated the 6th of <HI>July</HI> last, from St. <HI>George's-Fort,</HI> and the 13th of the same Month from <HI>Fort-Rich∣mond,</HI> in which you desire that the Conference between this Government and your Tribes may be sooner this Year than it was last Fail, as that was held in your Hunting Season, when but few of you could attend it, which created Jealousies and Dissatisfaction among those that were absent: And in the Letter from St. <HI>George's-Fort</HI> it is particularly signi∣fy'd, <Q>That if I was returned to <HI>Boston,</HI> you should be glad you might see me, which would be a great Satisfaction to you.</Q></P>
<P>In Answer to these Letters, I informed you in mine dated the 11th of <HI>August,</HI> of my Arrival at <HI>Boston</HI>; and that the Business of my Go∣vernment would not permit me to meet you in Person this Year; but that I should endeavour to send Commissioners to you as early as possible, with the Presents which this Government hath agreed to distribute an∣nually among you, so long as you shall maintain good Faith &amp; Friend∣ship with it. And I have since receiv'd Letters from you in Answer to it, dated <HI>August</HI> 23d from St. <HI>George</HI>'s, and the 20th from <HI>Richmond,</HI> wherein you tell me, you rejoice at my Return from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that you are sorry the Business of my Government will not admit of my meeting you this Year, that you like the Contents of my Letter very much, and de∣sire that the Commissioners may be sent to you early in this Month, which Time the <HI>Norridgawock</HI> Tribe inform me, will suit the St. <HI>Francois</HI> Indians well, some of them sent me at the same Time a Present of a String of Wampum, as a Token of Friendship from their Tribe, who desire to be admitted to the Conference and Treaty with us.</P>
<P>According to your Desire, <HI>Brethren,</HI> and my Promise to you, I now send you Commissioners to brighten the Covenant Chain between us, and to distribute the Presents among you, as soon as I possibly could.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="007025_0024_102AEBE33090DC80"/>
I must now, <HI>Brethren,</HI> acquaint you that I have receiv'd a Letter from the Jesuit <HI>Pierre <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> the French Missionary to <HI>Penobscott</HI> Tribe, dated the 25th of <HI>August</HI> just from St. <HI>George's</HI> Fort, in which he tells me, <Q>That he understands I design to have a Treaty with you, and desires me not to mention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Interview any more; that he had a great Deal of Trouble since the last Interview, to prevent the Jealousy of those Indians who were not present at it, from having a very mischievous Effect; and that the most sure Way to maintain Peace between you and us, would be for to let him know our Will, and that he would take Care to let me know your's; and he intreats me, that if I write to him, and think proper to pay any Regard to what he shall write to me in Answer, that it may be transacted between us as secretly as is possible, for that he desired nothing so much as to maintain Peace:</Q> As you will see by his Letter under his own Hand.</P>
<P>I must also apprize you, that I have receiv'd a Letter from an English∣man, informing me, that the same Jesuit assur'd him, a War would soon break out between the two Nations, and between us and you, and urg'd him to write to me, to prevent the Commissioners from coming to treat with you; and that he made him promise, that he would not let you know what he said, nor that he had wrote to me.</P>
<P>This Letter and Suggestions of the Jesuit, <HI>Brethren,</HI> the plain Design of which is to prevent this Government from having any Treaty with you, and consequently from making you the Presents which they have promised to give you from Year to Year; being so contrary to your De∣sire express'd in your Letter to me, and to the Friendship which this Government hath for you, and is desirous to maintain with you: I thought proper, tho' this Priest, desires they may be kept secret from you, to communicate to you by the Commissioners, that you may judge for your selves, Whether instead of using his Endeavours to preserve Peace between us, as he solemnly professes in his Letter, he is not using Artifices to break it; Whether he is really seeking to promote your Welfare by doing thus, or the Interest of the <HI>French</HI> at your Cost, and How far you may confide in the Sincerity of this holy Father your Confessor.</P>
<P>I can further assure, <HI>Brethren,</HI> that this Priest's Suggestion, that War will soon break out between the two Nations, is groundless, and that there was no Sign of it in <HI>France,</HI> whilst I was there about a Year ago, nor in <HI>England,</HI> which I left a few Months since: I doubt not but the <HI>French</HI> may be desirous of involving you and us in a War, if they can, by their Artifices; but I have Reason to think, that they will not be fond of en∣tering into a War themselves with us very soon, least they should loose <HI>Canada</HI> in it, as they did <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> in the last.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="007025_0025_102AEBE4D56A50A8"/>
I have only to add, that if the Business of my Government will permit, I will endeavour to have the Satisfaction of an Interview with you my∣self the next Year, and recommend it to you, to preserve Peace and good Faith with us in the mean Time, in which Case you may depend upon all reasonable Acts of Kindness and Friendship on the Part of this Government, for promoting your Welfare and Prosperity.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I am, Brethren, Your assured Friend, W. SHIRLEY.</SIGNED>

<HEAD>Translation of the <HI>French</HI> Jesuit's LETTER, to His EX∣CELLENCY, referred to in the foregoing Conferences, is as follows.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE> <HI>Peace and Love from our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI></OPENER>
<P>I Understand, you desire a Treaty with the Indians of <HI>Penobscott.</HI> Permit me, Sir, to beg of you, not to mention this Interview any more, because the Indians being always either Hunting or Travelling, it is difficult for them all to be present at this Interview, and Jealousy may cause some or other of them to do Mischief. I had a great deal of Trouble after the last Interview, to prevent the Jealousy of those who were not present at it, from having a very bad Effect. The most sure Way to maintain Peace between you and the Indians, would be to let me know your Will, and I would take Care to let you know that of the Indians. I pray only, that if you write to me, and if you think fit to pay any Regard to what I shall Answer, we may do it as secretly as possible, for I desire nothing so much, as to maintain the Peace now subsisting. I will do all I can to this End, being no more engag'd for the Service of the King of <HI>France,</HI> than I am for that of the King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>I am with Respect in Christ Jesus, Your most humble, And most obedient Servant,</HI> S. Peter Gounon, <HI>Of the Society of Jesus.</HI></SIGNED>
