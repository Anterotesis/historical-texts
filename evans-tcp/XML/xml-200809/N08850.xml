<OPENER><SALUTE>Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM sorry to acquaint you that one <HI>Frederick Stump,</HI> and <HI>John Ironcutter,</HI> some Time ago, having sold some Rum to a few <HI>Indians</HI> of your Nations, they all got drunk at <HI>Stump</HI>'s House on <HI>Middle Creek,</HI> and, in their Liquor, threatened to kill him and his Family, as he says; on which those two wicked Men murdered several of your People.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You must all be sensible that there are bad and foolish People of all Nations, whom at Times the evil Spirit gets the better of, and tempts to murder their most intimate Friends, and even Relations, in order to disturb the Peace and Tranquillity of their Neighbours—These Accidents often happen amongst yourselves, as well as among us, but the imprudent Act of a few foolish People should not disturb the Peace of the many wise and innocent amongst us.</P>
<P>The great Giver of life has given us a good Heart, and Tongues to speak the Sen∣timents of our Hearts to each other—And when any Misfortune happens of this Kind to either of us, we should consider well the Consequences, and meet under the Tree of Peace, and smoke together as our Forefathers formerly did, and endeavour to ad∣just and settle any Disputes that might formerly happen, that so no black Clouds might arise over our Heads, to prevent us from seeing the Sun rise and set over us in the strictest Friendship.</P>
<P>This is the Method I propose to take on this unlucky Occasion, and recommend to you my Brethren, and desire you may rest easy and satisfied till you hear from me again. The strictest Justice shall be done you, and I make no Doubt but you will be satisfied with my Conduct.</P>
<P>On first hearing of this unfortunate Affair, I issued a Proclamation, and had those two Men apprehended and put into Prison, and make no Doubt but to bring them to that Punishment so heinous a Crime deserves, by the Laws of their Country.</P>
<P>I have wrote to Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> and informed him of this Accident; and as soon as my Express returns, you may be sure to hear from me and him farther on this Matter, and more to your Satisfaction, at you will be convinced of the Justice and upright Intentions of all His Majesty's Subjects, towards your several Nations.</P>

<P>IT is not long since I sent a Message to you, to be delivered by Mr. <HI>Alexand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> M'kee.</HI></P>
<P>You will see that that Message was sent on Purpose to acquaint you that two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our bad Inhabitants had murdered some of our <HI>Indian</HI> Brethren, at <HI>Middle Creek,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Susquehanna,</HI> and that I was taking all the Pains in my Power to have the Murdere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> apprehended, and brought to the Punishment they justly deserve.</P>
<P>Ever since I sent that Message to you my Heart has been so deeply afflicted wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sorrow, for the Loss you have sustained by that barbarous Act, that I could not res<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or sleep quiet in my Bed, as I well knew it was a very great Breach of the solem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Engagements we had entered into of preserving the strictest Friendship between u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in not suffering the least Link in the Chain to be broken or any Ways hurt.</P>
<P>I have longed much to come myself to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> to take you by the Hand, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> down and condole with you, on so melancholy an Occasion, in the Losses you hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sustained in the Death of some of our good Brethren the <HI>Indians;</HI> but I must let yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> know that the great Affairs I have to manage in the Government, necessarily detai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me at this Time in <HI>Philadelphia.</HI>—I have therefore appointed my good Brother, <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Allen,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and the provincial Secretary, <HI>Joseph Shippen,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Commissioners, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meet you on this Occasion, and to speak and condole with you in my Stea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>I am now to inform you, that I have since received Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI>'s Answer, and am pleased to hear that he has laid this Matter before a large Number of <HI>Indians,</HI> as well of the Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nations as of several other Northern Tribes of <HI>Indians,</HI> with whom he has lately held friendly Conferences at his House.

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The unhappy Accidents which have happened to some of your People, in my Go∣vernment, have given me great Concern, as I have already told you; I, with this String of Wampum, gather up the Bones of all our dead Friends, and bury them in the Earth that they may be no more seen.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As I have buried the Bones of all our deceased Friends, I condole with you for the Loss you have sustained in them, and cover their Graves with these few Goods.</P>
<P><HI>Delivered the Condolance Presents.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>With this Belt of Wampum, I clean the Blood off the Leaves and Earth whereon it was sprinkled, that the sweet Herbs, which come through the Earth, may have their usual Verdure, and that we may all forget the unhappy Accidents that have happened.</P>
<P><HI>A large white Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Hearken now to what I have to say further to you, in Behalf of myself and all the good People of this Province.</P>
<P>I am informed that some wicked and ill-disposed People have told you many Lies, endeavoured to make you believe that the good People of my Province are not well af∣fected towards you, but intend you some Mischief, and are not desirous of preserving the Chain of Friendship bright and entire between us. You may depend on it that all such Representations are false, and without the least Foundation, and are made with no other View than to make a Breach between us, and the Authors must be looked upon as our greatest Enemies. To assure you that I am desirous and sincere in my In∣tentions, to live always in the strictest Harmony with you, and to remove every Unea∣siness that may be lodged in your Breasts, I have impowered and instructed my Com∣missioners, to confer with you on any Matters which immediately relate to my Go∣vernment; and to hear what you may have to say to me with Regard to all such Things as may contribute to preserve the Peace, and strengthen that Band of Friend∣ship in which you are united with the good People of this Province: And I make no Doubt but you have the same good Dispositions that I have to promote that End; and that all Thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will be freely communicated to one another in these Conferences. I desire, therefore, that you will fully inform my Commissioners of every Thing that gives you the least Uneasiness, that I may know it and endeavour to remove all Cause of Discontent among you.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I have told you every Thing I had to say to you relative to the unhappy Murder committed by two of our wicked People, on some of your Brethren; and as I am, and have been, doing every Thing in my Power to bring those Offenders to Justice, I can∣not help reminding you of the Number of People I have lost in the <HI>Indian</HI> Country, by some of your foolish young Men; and as I am determined that the strictest Justice shall be done you, I must let you know that I expect the same Justice from you for the Loss of His Majesty's Subjects intrusted to my Care. This is agreeable to the Treaties of Friendship long subsisting between your several Nations and us; and if we both unite in attending strictly to those Treaties, we shall be able to preserve the Chain of Friendship bright, and without Rust.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have now heard what the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> hath said to you by his Com∣missioners; and you see that he and the wise Men of that Province have not forgo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the former Friendship which subsisted between your Forefathers and theirs.

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I now desire you will assemble all the wise Men of your several Tribes together and call to Mind your former Treaties with the good People of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and con∣sider what has been said to you, and speak your Minds freely and openly to the Go¦vernor's Commissioners, that every Thing which gives you Uneasiness, or Discontent may be fully known to your Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> as he has desired.</P>

<P>After the above Speeches were interpreted to the different Nations, one of the Chief spoke, and said they would take them into Consideration, and let us know when they should be ready to answer them.</P>
<P>Then a Deputy sent from the Six Nation Country got up, and delivered the fol∣lowing Message to the several Nations present.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am sent from the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Council with this Speech, to inform you, that they have considered well the past Conduct of their Warriors in going through this Country to and from War, who have made a Practice of stealing Horses, and behaving other∣wise very ill to their Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> and have forbid their doing any Mischie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the future; and do now desire you the <HI>Shawanese, Delawares,</HI> and <HI>Wyandotts</HI> to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>QUEQUEDAGAYTHO, Speaker for the <HI>Delawares,</HI> rose up and made the fol∣lowing Answer to the Message from the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We return you Thanks for your Kindness in sending Commissioners to condole with us, on Account of the unhappy Accidents which have happened between us; as also for the friendly Messages they have delivered to us in your Name, and you may be as∣sured we shall pay due Regard to every Thing you have therein said to us.</P>
<P>He then requested the several Nations present to attend to what he was about to say further to their Brother, the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania;</HI> and proceded.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>The Grief and Concern which you have expressed to us, on Account of the late Mischiefs committed on our People, we believe to be very sincere, and that they were caused by the Evil Spirit. You have also mentioned, in a particular Manner, several Losses which you have sustained in the <HI>Indian</HI> Country; we are heartily sorry for them, but must acquaint you, that as to the Murder of the Ten Men in the Batteaus, down this River, we have heard of it as well as you, but it was committed by other Nations, and not by any of the Tribes here present, so that we have not had the least Concern in this unhappy Affair.—It is too true that one of your People was killed by the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> and we are also very sorry for that Accident.—As to the Man who, you say, was killed near Fort <HI>Pitt,</HI> by a <HI>Delaware Indian,</HI> we tell you that the Person who committed that Fact, was half a white Man, and the other half an <HI>Indian;</HI> so you see, Brother, that you are equally concerned with us in that Breach of Friendship; but I hope, Brother, all these Misfortunes are now buried in Oblivion, and that our Chil∣dren may never think of them more, and that we may continue in the strictest Friend∣ship.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>I shall, in the next Place, speak to you concerning the Friendship that subsists be∣tween us; I hope we shall always be firm in it; and we shall endeavour, on our Parts to keep the Chain as bright and strong as our Forefathers did at their first Councils, which were held by wise Men.</P>

<P>He then repeated the same Ceremonies that we had used in the burying the Bones, the said,——</P>

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>By this Belt I also wipe away the Blood, as you have done, from the Earth, and make your Bodies quite clean, that you may appear to have as good Hearts as those of our wise Forefathers; and we hope what passes in this Council will never be forgotten.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We are much obliged to the Governor for speaking so freely and openly to us from his Heart, and as he has recommended to us to take fast hold of the Chain of Friend∣ship, we assure him we shall take his Advice, and will do it; and that we shall like∣wise speak to him from our Hearts, for we look upon this as the only Way to preserve our Friendship; and we shall take Care to guide and direct our young People to behave as they ought to do, in promoting the Peace, and cultivating the strictest Harmony between us.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Beaver,</HI> a Chief of the <HI>Delawares,</HI> then rising up, desired all present <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Attention to what he should say to his Brother, the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We, the old Men of the different Nations present, are much rejoiced that the Chain of Friendship is now brightened by our Brother, the Governor of <HI>Pennselvania,</HI> and we return him Thanks for putting it into our Hands, in the kind Manner he has done, which convinces us of his good Intentions.</P>
<P>We, the <HI>Delawares, Shawanese, Munsies, Mohickons, Wyandotts</HI> and our Uncles the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> will keep fast hold of the Chain of Friendship, in the Manner you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us.

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We make the Road smooth and pleasant for your Commissioners to travel Home, and make a Report to you, at our ancient Council Fire in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> of what they now hear from us. And when you consider our Speeches, you will find that our Hearts are good, and that we are determined to preserve the Road of Peace free from any In∣terruption on our Parts: We desire you will take the same Care on your Parts, for if any Logs shall be laid across it, by any of your People, it will be undoing every Thing that is now agreed on between our several Nations and you at this Meeting.</P>

<P>Then <HI>Quequedagaytho</HI> rose and said that they had spoken every Thing they had to say, at this Time, to their Brother <HI>Onas;</HI> and, addressing himself to Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> spoke as follows,</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have been long acquainted with you, and are well pleased with your Behaviour towards us; and, at this Time, are the more obliged to you for introducing to us the Commissioners from the Government of <HI>Pennsylvania;</HI> as it has given us a good Op∣portunity of renewing our Peace with the good People of that Province, with whom our Forefathers always lived in the most perfect Friendship. You spoke to us the other Day, and recommended to us to take into our most serious Consideration the several Matters we have heard from the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> by his Commissioners, and to weigh them well in our Minds before we give our Answers to them.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>We have taken your Advice, and you may be convinced of this by what we have just now said in Behalf of the <HI>Delawares, Munsies</HI> and <HI>Mohickons.</HI></P>

<P>The Great Giver of Life has brought us all together, at this Council <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in order to promote the good Work of Peace; and we have heard what our Brother <HI>Onas</HI> hath said to us b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Commissioners; and you will now hearken attentively to what the <HI>Six Nations</HI> are about to say to him in Answer to his Messages.</P>

<P>You have already heard what our Nephews, the <HI>Delawares,</HI> have said to you; they have spoken freely and openly to you from their Hearts; and we hope it has made a proper Impression on you; we are now in like Manner going to open our Hearts to you freely, and we also hope that what we shall deliver will be received by you in a friendly Manner.</P>

<P><HI>Brother</HI> Onas,</P>
<P>In your several Speeches you have desired us to open our Minds freely, and to speak before you every Thing that gives us Uneasiness; we are obliged to you for this Ad∣vice, which we shall follow, and are glad of an Opportunity to speak to you in Coun∣cil.</P>
<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>It is not without Grief that we see our Country settled by you, without our Know∣ledge or Consent; and it is a long Time since we first complained to you of this Griev∣ance; which we find has not as yet been redressed; but Settlements are still extending farther into our Country.

<P><HI>Brother,</HI></P>
<P>You have Laws amongst you to govern your People by, and it will be the strongest Proof of the Sincerity of your Friendship to let us see that you remove the People from our Lands; as we look upon it, it will be Time enough for you to settle them when you have purchased them, and the Country becomes yours.</P>

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>When you talked of Peace to us, at the Time we were struggling in War, we did not hearken to you at first. You mentioned it a second Time to us, we still refused to attend to you; but after repeating it to us several Times, we consented to hear you. We then looked at you, and saw you holding Instruments of War in your Hands, which we took from you, and cast them into the Air out of our Sight. We afterwards desired you to destroy your Forts, as that would be the Way to make all Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> believe you were sincere in your Friendship; and we now repeat the same Re∣quest to you again.—We also desire you not to go down this River, in the Way of the Warriors, belonging to the foolish Nations to the Westward; and told you that the Waters of this River, a great Way below this Place, were coloured with Blood; you did not pay any Regard to this, but asked us to accompany you in going down, which we did, and we felt the Smart of our Rashness, and with Difficulty returned to our Friends. We see you now about making Batteaus, and we make no Doubt you in∣tend going down the River again, which we now tell you is disagreeable to all Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> and now again desire you to sit still at this Place.</P>
<P>They are also uneasy to see that you think yourselves Masters of this Country, be∣cause you have taken it from the <HI>French,</HI> who you know had no Right to it, as it is the Property of us <HI>Indians.</HI> We often hear that you intend to fight with the <HI>French</HI> again, if you do, we desire you will remove your Quarrel out of this Country, and carry it over the great Waters, where you used to fight, and where we shall neither see or know any Thing of it. All we desire is to enjoy a quiet Peace with you both▪ and that we should be strong in talking of Peace.</P>
<P>We have now spoken to you from our Hearts, and hope we shall exert ourselves in promoting a lasting Friendship. All we have to say to you now is to be strong, and let us agree to what we desire of each other. When you first talked of Peace to us, you desired us to sit over the River quietl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at our Fires; but our Women and Children were frightened away by the Noise you made in repairing your Fort; but if you do as we desired you, they will return without Fear.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have heard what we have desired in our last Speech, and we hope you will comply with our Request, and not attempt to go down this River again, as the Na∣tions who live that Way are surprized to see you make a Practice of this, at the same Time that you were making Professions of Friendship to us. We therefore desire you will put a Stop to your People going down this River, till we have spoke to the Nations living in that Country; which we intend to do with the Assistance of our Brothers the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and our Grandfathers the <HI>Delawares.</HI></P>

<P>We are glad to see you here, and that you are sent by the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> to confer with us at this Council.

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We have now, on all Sides, cleared and made smooth the Road between you and us; and we desire you, on your Parts, to be strong, and not suffer any of your Soldiers to travel it, who carry sharp edged Weapons with them, as that may injure the Friend∣ship subsisting between us.</P>

<P><PB N="14" REF="011301_0013_0F86F217CDEB5EA8"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">1768.</NOTE><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>What our Chief has just now mentioned to you is very true, and you will see by this Paper, that, during the late unhappy Differences between us, we held a Treaty with Colonel <HI>Broadstreet,</HI> by which we agreed, that you had a Right to build Forts and trading Houses where you pleased, and to travel the Road of Peace, from the Sun-rising to the Sun-setting. At that Treaty the <HI>Shawanese</HI> and <HI>Delawares</HI> were with me, and know all this well; and I am much surprized that the <HI>Shawanese</HI> should speak to you in the Manner they did Yesterday.</P>
<P>The Commissioners then addressed themselves to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and spoke as fol∣lows:</P>

<P>It gave us great Pleasure to hear what you said the other Day to your Brother <HI>Onas</HI> and we thank you in his Name for the Readiness you discovered in brightening and making strong our antient Chain of Friendship.

<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We esteem it a strong Mark of the Sincerity and Goodness of your Hearts, that you have opened them to us so freely and fully, as your Brother <HI>Onas</HI> earnestly desired you, that he might know whatever lay still concealed within your Breasts, which gave you any Uneasiness.</P>

<P>You have candidly and publicly told us that you are now easy with Respect to al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> former Losses you have suffered by our Means, and that you will take no farther No∣tice of such Things. This intirely corresponds with your strong Professions of Friend∣ship.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have also freely, and without Reserve, informed us that the only Grievance which you now have Reason to complain of, is the Settlement made on your Lands We are glad, Brethren, we have now so good an Opportunity of acquainting you, as well as the several Nations present, with the Mind of your Brother <HI>Onas,</HI> and the En¦deavours which have been used to do you Justice in this Respect.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We can assure you that nothing has given him more Concern than to find a Number of foolish People should dare to seat themselves on Lands in this Province, which your good Friends the Proprietors have not a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet purchased from you. Governor <HI>Penn,</HI> therefore, as well from his own sincere and earnest Inclinations to remove this Inju∣ry done you, as by the express Commands of our great King <HI>George,</HI> issued Proclama∣tions, near two Years ago, ordering all Persons whatsoever, who had settled on your Lands, to remove without Delay, and forbidding others from taking the least Possession of any, under the severest Penalty of the Law.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>As the People, who have settled your Lands, came chiefly from <HI>Virginia,</HI> the Go∣vernor of that Province likewise issued Proclamations and Orders to the same Purpose. The King's General too (His Excellency General <HI>Gage)</HI> hath twice sent up Parties of Soldiers to the People living on <HI>Redstone</HI> Creek and the <HI>Monongabela,</HI> to warn them off your Lands, and threatened them with seizing their Persons and Effects, if they re∣fused to move away. But, Brethren, we are sorry to tell you, that none of these Mea∣sures have had the desired Effect; and, therefore, Governor <HI>Penn,</HI> and his Assembly, having still your Interest greatly at Heart, passed a Law, in <HI>February</HI> last, inflicting the Penalty of Death on all Persons who should continue on your Lands after the first Day of <HI>June</HI> next; and, in order that the People, who were settled on them, might have timely and proper Notice of that Law, Governor <HI>Penn,</HI> near two Months ago, sent to them four prudent and honest Men to distribute Copies of it among them, with a Number of Proclamations, commanding them to obey it strictly, under the Penalty of Death, and also to read and explain them fully to all those People.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Those four Men have lately returned home, and reported to the Governor of <HI>Penn∣sylvania,</HI> that they had executed his Orders; but that they were told by the People
<PB N="15" REF="011301_0014_0F86F218A20394A0"/>
settled at and near <HI>Redstone</HI> Creek,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> that they had been encouraged by the <HI>Indians</HI> them∣selves to continue on those Lands; that, however, they are determined to obey the Law, and move off without Delay. But, Brethren, we are sorry to tell you, that as soon as the Men sent by the Governor had prevailed on the Settlers to consent to a Compliance with the Law, there came among them eight <HI>Indians,</HI> who live at the <HI>Mingo</HI> Town down this River, and desired the People not to leave their Settlements, but to sit quiet on them till the present Treaty at this Place should be concluded. The People, on receiving this Advice and Encouragement, suddenly changed their Minds, and determined not to quit their Places, till they should hear farther from the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> then delivered to the Men sent by the Governor a String of Wampum, and a Speech, which they desired them to carry to the Governor. The Speech was this:—<Q>You are sent here by your great Men to tell these People to go away from the Lands which you say is ours, and our great Men have sent us, and we are glad to meet here the same Day. We tell you the white People must stop, and we stop them till the Treaty; and when <HI>George Croghan</HI> and our great Men shall speak together, we will tell them what to do.</Q></P>
<P>Now, Brethren, we cannot help expressing to you our great Concern at this Beha∣viour of those <HI>Indians,</HI> as it has absolutely frustrated the Steps the Governor was taking to do you Justice, by the immediate Removal of those People from your Lands. And we must tell you. Brethren, that the Conduct of those <HI>Indians</HI> appears to us very astonish∣ing; and we are much at a Loss to account for the Reason of it at this Time, when the <HI>Six Nations</HI> are complaining of Encroachments being made on their Lands. You your∣selves, Brethren, must be very sensible that, while any of the <HI>Indians</HI> encourage the People to stay on your Lands, it will inevitably defeat all our Measures to remove them. But, Brethren, all that we have now to desire of you is, that you will immedi∣ately send off some of your prudent and wise Men with a Message to the People settled at <HI>Redstone, Youghoghainy,</HI> and <HI>Monongahela,</HI> to contradict the Advice of the eight <HI>Indians</HI> from the <HI>Mingo</HI> Town; and to acquaint them that you very much disapprove of their continuing any longer on their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ttlements; and that you expect they will quit them without Delay.</P>
<P>If you agree to this, we will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd an honest and discreet white Man to accompany your Messengers. And, Brethren, if after receiving such Notice from you, they shall refuse to remove by the Time limited them, you may depend upon it, the Govern∣ment will not fail to put the Law into immediate Execution against them.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P>The Commissioners then, addressing themselves to the <HI>Shawanese,</HI> spoke as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>In the first Part of your Speeches Yesterday, you acquainted us that it was very disa∣greeable to you to see a Fort continued at this Place, contrary to your Expectations, and that you were very sorry to find a Number of Batteaus building here, in order to go down the River. With Regard to these Things we can only say, it is not a little sur∣prizing to us that you should mention them at this Time, as we have always under∣stood that this Matter was settled with the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and all other <HI>Indians,</HI> several Years ago, and their full Consent obtained for keeping Forts in your Country, as well as for going down this River to trade. But, Brethren, as we came here to confer with you on Subjects which only relate to the Province of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> we have no Concern in this Business. It is an Affair of our great King of <HI>England,</HI> and as such we must refer you for a more particular Answer to Mr. <HI>Croghan,</HI> who, you know, is ap∣pointed by his Majesty to transact his Affairs with the <HI>Indians</HI> in this Country.</P>
<P>The Commissioners then spoke to the <HI>Delawares, Shawanese, Munsies, Mohickons,</HI> and <HI>Wyandotts,</HI> as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We now return you Thanks, in the Name of the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and in Behalf of the good People of that Province, for the kind Manner in which you have received his Messages by us. We assure you it gave us great Satisfaction to hear you declare, in this public Council, your hearty Concurrence with him in keeping fast hold of the Chain of Friendship, and your Determination to preserve it bright, and not to suffer any little Accidents to make a Breach in it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="011301_0015_0F86F219EF1C97B8"/><NOTE PLACE="marg">1768.</NOTE><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It is a strong Proof of the Sincerity of your Hearts, that you have resolved to forget intirely all the past Mischiefs and Injuries which have been committed by the Folly of our wicked and rash young Men, and we now hope these Things will never interrupt our future Peace and Happiness.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We also thank you for making the Road smooth between you and the People of <HI>Penn∣sylvania,</HI> by removing all the Obstructions that were in it, in such a Manner that it may be travelled by all People with Ease and Safety.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>It will give us much Pleasure, when we return to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to communicate to the Governor all that has passed between us in these Conferences; and to assure him of your friendly Dispositions and upright Intentions, which you may depend on we shall faithfully do.</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P>The Commissioners having finished what they had to say to the <HI>Indians,</HI> Mr. <HI>Crog∣han</HI> made them the following Speeches:</P>
<P><HI>Brethren the</HI> Shawanese,</P>
<P>When you spoke Yesterday to the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> you desired him to de∣stroy this Fort, and not to pass down this River, as it was bloody; and said that our Warriors, passing through your Country, gave you and all other Nations great Unea∣siness in your Minds.—You are the only Nation that has mentioned this Circum∣stance, and I must tell you that this Fort was built by the King's Orders, and that your Brother, the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> has no Concern in this Matter.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I well remember that when the <HI>French</HI> first bui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a Fort here, and passed up and down this River, you did not desire them to destroy their Forts, and leave your Coun∣try. We were at War with your old Fathers, the <HI>French,</HI> when we drove them away, and took Possession of this Fort; after that we conquered them, which you well know, and when we came here the <HI>Six Nations</HI> agreed to it, and came with us▪ and opened a Road of Peace through all this Country, from the Sun-rising to the Sun-setting, both by Land and Water, that we might talk in Peace with all Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> to the Westward; and we thought the <HI>Six Nations</HI> had a Right so to do, as we always understood that they were the original Proprietors of this Country.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>When I was first going down this River, by Order of his Excellency General <HI>Gage▪</HI> and the Honourable Sir <HI>William Johnson,</HI> all the Nations now present agreed to it, and sent Deputies with me to promote the good Works of Peace with all Nations o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Indians</HI> to the Westward; and to receive them into the Chain of Friendship subsisting between the King's Subjects, the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and all others in Alliance with them▪ and to take them under his Majesty's most gracious Protection, which has been sinc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> done. It is very true, when we first went down, we met with a Misfortune from som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Nations we were going to speak to, through the Instigation of the <HI>French,</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then had an Influence with those People to persuade them to do Mischief, but eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> since that Time those Nations have behaved well to their Brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> and after that unhappy Accident, by which we were Sufferers, Captain <HI>Murray</HI> and Mr <HI>M'Kee</HI> condoled with your Nation for your Losses, agreeable to the antient Custom of our Forefathers, and buried the Bones of our deceased Friends, whose Loss gave me great Pain of Mind; and I did not expect to find their Bones raked out of the Ground, and brought into Council at this Time, especially as you must know that we were struck by the very Hatchet you yourselves put into their Hands to strike the <HI>English</HI> with.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>By the late Treaty of Peace between the King of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> King, the latter gave us Possession of all their Forts and Towns, as we had conquered them. You likewise took Notice, Yesterday, of our building Boats, and making Repairs to this Fort. I must tell you, that the King my Master never made War o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any <HI>Indian</HI> Nation in this Country; on the contrary, he has always promoted Peace
<PB N="17" REF="011301_0016_0F86F21A1181FEA0"/>
among you;<NOTE PLACE="marg">176<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> an Instance of which you see in the Peace brought about between the <HI>Six Nations</HI> and <HI>Cherokees.</HI> But you all well know that the <HI>French</HI> acted on different Principles, by setting one Nation at War against another. This Conduct of theirs was not pleasing to the <HI>Six Nations;</HI> they, therefore, requested the <HI>English</HI> to go with them and Sir <HI>William Johnson</HI> to drive the <HI>French</HI> from <HI>Niagara,</HI> and put it into the Possession of the <HI>English,</HI> which you all well know they did; and since that Time our Warriors have passed through this Country from Fort to Fort, and back again, and no Difference has happened between them and your People. I am therefore surprized, Brethren, to hear you want to stop the Road of Peace that hath been so long opened for all Nations, from the Sun-rising to the Sun-setting:</P>
<P><HI>A Belt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> Six Nations, Shawanese, Delawares, Wyandotts, Munsies <HI>and</HI> Mohickons, <HI>give Attention to what I am going to say to you.</HI></P>
<P>It gives me great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tisfaction to find that the Measures taken by the Governor of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and the wise People of that Province, have proved so effectual and agree∣able to your several Nations as to remove all Uneasiness from your Minds, on Account of the many Accidents that have happened between your People and the King's sub∣jects in that Province; and that you have buried them so deep in the Earth that nei∣ther you, nor your Children yet unborn, may ever call them to Remembrance.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>Your Forefathers lived in the strictest Friendship with the worthy Founder of that Province, and the good People that came with him; and you have now renewed and brightened that antient Chain of Friendship with the Governors Commissioners, in Be∣half of the King's Subjects in that Government. I now recommend it to your several Nations to hold fast by that Chain, and act on the same Principles your wife Forefa∣thers formerly did.</P>
<P><HI>A String.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>You have all heard what the <HI>Six Nations</HI> said to you by their Deputies, that they heartily repented of their own past ill Conduct towards their Brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> in stealing Horses and committing other Abuses; and they have desired you, Brethren, to cast out all evil Thoughts from your Minds, and return any stolen Horses you may have amongst you, and think of nothing, for the future, but promoting the good Work of Peace between you and your good Brethren, the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> your Father and my Master, takes Delight in promot∣ing Peace among all Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> in this Country, and his own Subjects, which you must be well acquainted with. You all daily experience his Love towards you, and his Pity for your Necessities, by the Favours you constantly receive from his Of∣ficers here and elsewhere, and I am sorry to say that your past Conduct shews a Want of Gratitude in you to his Subjects.</P>
<P>Whenever the King makes Peace with any Nation, he never violates his Engage∣ments, though he always has it in his Power to chastize any People that dare be so hardy as to disturb the Tranquillity of their Neighbours.—But I now trust, Brethren, that your future Conduct will be such as may merit his Majesty's Esteem and Protec∣tion.</P>
<P>By this Belt I now clear the Road of Peace, and make it smooth and easy to travel, from the Sun-rising to the Sun-setting, that your Brethren the <HI>English,</HI> and all Nations of <HI>Indians,</HI> may travel it with Pleasure, as one People, united in the strongest Chain of Friendship, that our Women, and Children yet unborn, may mutually enjoy the Blessings of a lasting Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren of the</HI> Six Nations, <HI>who are settled at the</HI> Two Creeks,</P>
<P>I am sorry to hear from some of your Brethren, the <HI>English,</HI> that whenever any of them pass by your Village, you take Rum and other Things from them. You must be sensible this Conduct is very wrong, and a Breach of your Engagements to us. I hope I shall hear no more of it. You have been desired three Years ago, by the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Council, to remove up this River nearer to their Country, and I now desire
<PB N="18" REF="011301_0017_0F86F21AE31E99C0"/>
you will take that Message into your most serious Consideration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768.</NOTE> and do as they have directed you; which will be very agreeable to all your Brethren the <HI>English.</HI></P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Croghan</HI> having finished what he had to say to the <HI>Indians,</HI> the Commissioners addressed themselves to all the Nations present, and said,</P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>We are now to acquaint you, that, by order of the Government of <HI>Pennsylvania▪</HI> we deliver to you a Present of Goods, to be distributed among the several Tribe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> present, to clothe your Women and Children; and we desire you will receive them as a Testimony of the Affection and Regard which the Governor and good People o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Province have for you.</P>
<P>The Commissioners then delivered the Presents to the different Tribes, amounting to <HI>One Thousand and Fifty Pounds, Pennsylvania</HI> Currency, including the several pri¦vate Presents made to the Chiefs and principal Warriors.</P>
<P><HI>This Evening arrived here Twenty-five</HI> Six Nation <HI>Warriors, on their Return from the</HI> Cherokee <HI>Country, and brought with them two Prisoners.</HI></P>

<P>As soon as you arrive in the midst of the Settlements near <HI>Redstone</HI> Creek, it will be proper to convene as many of the Settlers as possible, to whom the <HI>Indians</HI> m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> then deliver their Message, which shall be given to you in Writing; and we desir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you will leave a few Copies of it with the principal People, that they may commu¦nicate the same to those who live at any considerable Distance from them. We here with furnish you with a Copy of the Speech delivered to us at this Treaty by the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> respecting the Settlement of their Lands, which you will be pleased to rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Settlers for their Information.</P>
<P>You may then acquaint them, that they must now be convinced by this Message and the Speech of the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> that they have hitherto been grossly deceived b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a few straggling <HI>Indians</HI> of no Consequence, who may have encouraged them to con¦tinue on their Settlements; and that they will now be left without the least Pretenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="21" REF="011301_0020_0F86F21D0FCA0DA0"/>
or Excuse for staying on them any longer. However, we make no Doubt, but,<NOTE PLACE="marg">176<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> be∣fore you reach <HI>Redstone,</HI> many of the Families will have removed, in Obedience to the late Law passed in this Province, which has been read and fully explained to them by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Steel,</HI> and the other Gentlemen whom the Governor sent up to them in <HI>March</HI> last.</P>
<P>But should you find any of those inconsiderate People still actuated by a lawless and obstinate Spirit to bid Defiance to the civil Authority, you may let them know, that we were under no Necessity of sending, in the Name of the Governor, any further Notice to them, or of being at the Pains of making them acquainted with the real Minds of the <HI>Indians,</HI> to induce them to quit their Settlements, for that the Powers of Government are sufficient to compel them to pay due Obedience to the Laws; and they may depend upon it, they will be effectually exerted, if they persist in their Obstinacy.</P>
<P>You may likewise assure them, that they need not attempt to make an Offer of Terms with the Government respecting their Removal, as we hear some of them have vainly proposed to do, by saying, they would go off the Lands immediately, on Condition that they should be secured to them as soon as the Proprietary Purchase is made. It is a high Insult on Government for those People even to hint such Things.</P>
<P>The only Motives, therefore, which excite us to make Use of the present Ex∣pedient of sending you with Messengers from the <HI>Indians</HI> on this Occasion, is the compassionate Concern we have for the dangerous Situation and Distresses of those unhappy People, and the Hopes we have that, by this Means, they may be convinced it is their true and best Interest to pay a due Submission to the Laws, by relinquishing their Settlements without Delay. If any of them should talk of petitioning the Go∣vernor for a Preference in taking up the Lands they have improved, you may assure them from us, that it will be to no Manner of Purpose, till they have first complied with the Law.</P>
<P>We depend greatly on your Care and Prudence in executing this Business to our Satisfaction, and recommend it to you to be particularly careful that the <HI>Indian</HI> Mes∣sengers are treated with the greatest Civility and Kindness. When you return to Fort <HI>Bedford,</HI> we beg you will write us an Account of your Proceedings. We wish you a safe Return to your Families, and are, with great Regard,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Messrs. <HI>Frazer</HI> and <HI>Thompson</HI> being in Readiness with their Horses and Provisions, for their Journey to <HI>Redstone</HI> Creek, the Commissioners sent several Times for the <HI>Indian</HI> Messengers, who at last came to them to the Fort, and acquainted them that they had been seriously considering the Business they were going to be sent on, and it now appeared to them so disagreeable, that they could by no means consent to undertake it, and immediately returned the Wampum which had been given them. Upon being interrogated, as to the Reasons of their declining to perform what they had consented to, they answered, that three of them were sent as Deputies by the <HI>Six Nation</HI> Coun∣cil to attend the Treaty here; and having received no Directions from them to pro∣ceed any further, they chose to return Home, in order to make Report of what they had seen and heard at this Place. They further added, that the driving white People away from their Settlements was a Matter which no <HI>Indians</HI> could, with any Satis∣faction, be concerned in, and they thought it most proper for the <HI>English</HI> themselves to compel their own People to remove from the <HI>Indian</HI> Lands.</P>
<P>After this Refusal of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who had been appointed to carry the Message from the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> the Commissioners in vain attempted to persuade or procure others to execute the Business, though they used great Endeavours for that Purpose; and they thought it both useless and imprudent to continue to press a Matter on the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> which they found they were generally much averse to; and therefore con∣cluded to set out on their Return to <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> without further Delay. But in a short Time afterwards <HI>Kayashuta</HI> came with <HI>Arroas</HI> (a principal Warrior of the <HI>Six

Nations)</HI> to the Commissioners at their Lodgings;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1768.</NOTE> where the former addressed himself to them in Effect as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brethren,</HI></P>
<P>I am very sorry to find that you have been disappointed in your Expectations of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Indian</HI> Messengers going to <HI>Redstone,</HI> according to your Desire, and our Agreement; and I am much afraid that you are now going away from us with a discontented Mind, on this Account. Believe me, Brethren, this Thought fills my Heart with the deepest Grief, and I could not suffer you to leave us without speaking to you on this Subject, and endeavouring to make your Minds easy. We were all of us much disposed to com∣ply with your Request, and expected it could have been done without Difficulty, but I now find that not only the <HI>Indians</HI> appointed by us, but all our other young Men▪ are very unwilling to carry a Message from us to the white People, ordering them to remove from our Lands. They say they would not choose to incur the ill Will o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those People, for, if they should be now removed, they will hereafter return to thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Settlements, when the <HI>English</HI> have purchased the Country from us. And we shall be very unhappy, if, by our Conduct towards them at this Time, we shall give them Reason to dislike us, and treat us in an unkind Manner when they again become our Neighbours. We therefore hope, Brethren, you will not be displeased with us for not performing our Agreement with you, for you may be assured that we have good Hearts towards all our Brethren the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>The Commissioners returned <HI>Kayashuta</HI> many Thanks for his friendly Behaviour on this Occasion; and assured him that they greatly approved of the Conduct of all the <HI>Indians,</HI> during the Treaty, and were now returning home with very easy and con∣tented Minds. They further acquainted him that their Reason for urging them to send a Message to the <HI>Redstone</HI> Settlers proceeded intirely from the great Anxiety they had of contributing every Thing in their Power, that might expedite the Measures taken by the Government to do them Justice, and to redress every Injury they com∣plained of. Yet, as they found the Compliance of their Request was disagreeable to the <HI>Indians,</HI> they should not press the Matter on them any further, though it appeared to be a Step very necessary to be taken at this Time.</P>
<P>They then took Leave of the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the most friendly Manner, and sat out on their Return to <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
