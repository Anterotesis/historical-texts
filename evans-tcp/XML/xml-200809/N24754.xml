<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>I therefore, Prisoner of the Lord, beseech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called: with all lowliness and meekness, with long suffering, forbearing one another in love. Endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism: One God and Father of all: who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</Q>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ephes. iv. 1—6.</NOTE>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words, or nearly these, were the expressions of one of the Apostles, which have taken hold of my mind since I last sat down, and they have brought with them the remembrance of the unwearied labours of the pri∣mitive believers for the preservation of the unity of spirit in the bond of peace; that there might be no rents or schisms found among us, and that being called with the same hope as they were called, we all might be found one in him in whom they have believed. And I believe, my friends, that it ought to be the concern of every Gospel Minister this day. Indeed I can say when my mind is most encoura∣ged with hopes; the most ardent desire that I feel is, that notwithstanding there have many divisions taken place, yet the Lord may again so reveal himself to his professing visi∣ble Church, as to bring us all back into Unity of Spirit in the bonds of unspeakable peace. And I have no doubt at all in my mind, but that every jot and tittle of the pro∣phetic declaration of the Lord's Servant will in due time be fulfilled; that the Church will at length be one, and her name one; they will all speak the same language, and the watchmen will all see eye to eye.</P>
<P>And it may, my friends, be brought about by a variety of circumstances, unfathomable to human wisdom; for in∣deed all human wisdom is confounded in searching the things of God. But the glorious dispensation wherein we
<PB N="4" REF="032807_0003_0FF529174874B028"/>
live, whenever and wherever it is submitted to, produces the same effect as it did in the beginning, it confounds the wisdom of the wise; it brings to nought the understanding of the prudent; so that no flesh shall glory in the Lord's presence; that no man might say that others teach him; but that, by God's holy spirit, he was enabled to search the deep things of the mystery of his glorious kingdom.</P>
<P>This is my faith; and it remains to be very evidently so. Human wisdom is sufficient in many respect for our ac∣commodations through this temporary abode; it may keep us in some degree of rectitude; and amongst men it may also conduce greatly to the happiness of individuals; and if closely attended to, it may be of service to nations and kingdoms. But when we speak of it, as fathoming the everlasting mystery of God's kingdom, I believe we shall always be short.</P>
<P>It is not—it cannot be, that through the fallen wisdom of man, he can take in the knowledge of things divine and spiritual. It was not so in the primitive Church, though Paul was a great man, who was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel; and was skilful in all the learning of his times; it was not this learning that made him a minister of the Gospel; for by this, and while he continued merely subject to, and under the dominion of this wisdom, he was a persecutor of those that preached, and lived in the faith, as it is in Jesus Christ. And what made him a mi∣nister then? Why; when it pleased GOD, said he, in re∣vealing his Son, Jesus Christ, he was not disobedient, he was not gainsaying to the will of God; but when he believ∣ed himself called in this manner, he went forth, but not with the enticing words of man's wisdom; but in the fool∣ishness of the Cross. For though he was a great and learned man, he was first, before he could be a great man in the promoting of the truth of the gospel upon earth, he was first to be reduced, he was first alarmed; and the first lesson which all ought to learn is, If any man will be wise, let
<PB N="5" REF="032807_0004_0FF528E4B05590D0"/>
him first become a fool. If any man believe, or say, that he knows any thing, he knows nothing as he ought to know; for so says the Apostle.</P>
<P>Now, my friends, it may appear very extraordinary doctrine, at this time of day, but it was such as the apostles preached, such as they had approved, and by means of which they obtained the ministry of reconciliation, which they had received, and first were taught; that no man could know of the things that God had sent, but by the spirit of God, who revealed it to them; this was the foundation of their learning in the School of Christ, and <HI>other foundation can no man lay than that which has been already laid.</HI> This I am persuaded of in my own mind, that we must all, not only the ministers, but all those that would have a part in Christ, that would indeed enjoy an inheritance with him —they must all be taught of him and learn of him; they must lean upon his arm, the glorious and blessed deliverer of his people; they must have their exalted imaginations cast down; they must know and feel the power of his word, to bring them into humility, that they may be taught of him. And I believe there is an assent to the truth of this in many solid seeking minds that are now present. Though human learning and science in itself, when properly applied for the purposes which it is fitted and designed for, are by no means to be despised; nay when those who are qualified with what is called a liberal education, are, by the influence of the spirit of Jesus Christ, brought down into a true Christian state, they may be eminently qualified for the promoting of truth and righteousness in their day. So that I would not have you mistake. We make a distinc∣tion it is true: but when the Lord unites them, when he lays his hand upon those that have many advantages in the world, he may make them greater instruments in his hand. But I may also say, that some of the greatest ornaments that ever I have known in the church of Christ, who I believe were qualified for the preaching of the gospel in the de∣monstration
<PB N="6" REF="032807_0005_0FF528F34A3EF490"/>
of the spirit and of power, have been even among those that have had little advantages of this kind. As it was in the beginning, the same eternal power reigns; the God that commanded light to shine out of darkness having shone in their hearts, they dwelled and abode in those vocations wherewith they were called, and they have become ornaments in the church, and dignified mini∣sters of Christ. But, my friends, what I most want is, to see the people brought back again in essential matters; (I be∣lieve that many of all denominations believe in the revela∣tion of the spirit of the God of peace) and to instruct them in the way to everlasting peace, and to wait for it, and to re∣ceive it. There are many sheep, as Christ said, who hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, though they may be little known of the world. "My sheep they hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; and I will give them eternal life, and none shall be able to pluck them out of my hands. My father who gave them to me, is greater than all, and none shall be able to pluck them out of my heavenly father's hands." O! that you my dear fel∣low pilgrims and christians of every rank, and of every name, may experimentally know that you have need of Christ, then though you may be hidden from the world, yet the Lord knoweth, the Lord heareth your prayers, the Lord will magnify his power for your redemption and deli∣verance; and no other arm can deliver you from the power of death and hell. This I believe: and let us, my friends, be laying aside all controversies about those things which have so long oppressed Christianity by contention, needless and unprofitable contention. I think you will unite with me in saying this has been the case. O! how much need∣less and unprofitable contention there has been in the church of Christ, in the professing church of Christ; for if it had been true and solid—the foundation in Christ—there would have been no such contention; this is my faith; they would have been united in the bonds of peace and union for ever; they would have harmonized; the same divine spirit would
<PB N="7" REF="032807_0006_0FF528D4AC12DE10"/>
have spoken nearly the same language in all; there would have been no room for contention; there would have been no necessity for contention, if the Church of Christ had kept hold of the foundation which God laid in Sion; and if they had remembered the rock upon which he decla∣red he would build his Church, there would have been a different appearance. Now I believe the same divine Lord is offering, in everlasting mercy to all men, to bring them back again into this bond of fellowship, to put an end to all rents and divisions, to all contradiction, and persecutions to the end of the world. And what I desire very much, is, that all people may have faith in God, and in the revelation of his spirit, so as not to let us depart from the ancient doctrine. It is here the Church of Christ has been erring; by departing from this ancient doctrine which never was, by all that we can find in the whole New Testament, de∣signed to be changed. There never was to be another way, nor another dispensation to after ages, than was granted and given to the primitive believers. This I am bold to declare.</P>
<P>There was to be no new way into the sheep-fold, but that way Christ himself declared. "I am the door into the sheep∣fold. By me, if any man enter, he shall go in and out and find pasture." Well then, it is for this we sit down and wait in silence, that we may know the promises which are yea and amen for ever; that we may know the fulfilling of that which Christ has promised; to be with his church to the end of the world. "Lo I am with you alway—to the end of the world." And for the fulfilment of this promise there are many, I am persuaded, that not only wait seriously in silence, but are waiting and meditating upon God, and that be of the same opinion that I am, it being the way, the most effectual way, to be taught of this glorious myste∣ry, which God, in the riches of his mercy, teaches to all those that love him. But men are carried away too much with practices they have been long accustomed to; we
<PB N="8" REF="032807_0007_0FF528A68FC67B90"/>
are more filled with prejudices; and we have a great deal less charity about us than some would suppose them∣selves to have. We do not judge with that candour and impartiality we ought; nor think of things even of the highest importance as we ought to do; as wise men and wise women, as heirs of immortality and eternal life. Now I believe here is a large number present, who really are en∣quiring after the truth, and who are solicitous that they may know the truth and be established in it, more than they are to be of any names or forms.</P>
<P>Well, I believe there are those who are God's favourite children, under a variety of forms and observations, that I for my own part feel by no means to be essentially neces∣sary to believe of any importance, nor positively com∣manded to be continued. For when the soul is in love with God, has found the living and eternal substance of all the shadows, and all the figures that ever were in the world, it has no need of elementary things; why, my friends, there were many types and figures in former dis∣pensations that were commanded for a time, and they are said to be a schoolmaster to bring to Christ, who nailed the hand-writing of ordinances to the Cross.</P>
<P>But let every man be persuaded in his own mind; let every man attend to the light of Christ in his conscience; and follow the dictates of it fully and faithfully. If thou believest with all thine heart that it is thy duty in the sight of GOD to be plunged into water in the name of the Father, Son and holy Ghost, according to thy faith so be it to thee, let no man condemn thee. Nevertheless, I believe that when the substance of all types is fully found and felt, when he reigns in his kingdom of the heart, when he seats him∣self there, and when we have to partake of that bread which came down from heaven, we have no need of elementary things; for that is sufficient for the soul to nourish it up to eternal life.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="032807_0008_0FF528FB30EECF48"/>There were in the beginning many of the primitive be∣lievers who continued for a season in abundance of obser∣vations; they were even loth to renounce the dispensations that were passed away by the coming of Christ; and even when Christ's Kingdom was come into the hearts of them that received it, and when he had finished his work his Father had given him to do, and brought in the glorious dispensation, by which men might draw nigh to God; even then, there were some of the Apostles that thought it was necessary to use circumcision; they could not leave off education, they could not leave all at once those forms they had been accustomed to. Not so when it was brought to the Council at Jerusalem; they, according as they felt and understood matters, reasoned concerning them; they heard one another in the great council of Jerusalem. But what was the result of this council? why it clearly came to almost an end of all these things; and the day of Christ, it appeared, was advanced; they did not think these things necessary. They said, it seemeth good to lay upon you no greater burden than that ye abstain from fornication, from things offered to idols, from things strangled, and from blood; these were all the council at Jerusalem laid upon believers—to observe no greater burden; and some of which at this day are not accounted to be any more necessary than the washing of one another's feet was; though our Saviour did do this to manifest though he was Lord of all, he was even in the form of a Servant of all, and condescended in the depth of humility to wash his disciples feet. Here was a great example and pattern. "And he commanded them strictly (if we literally take the expressions of Scripture,) as I your Lord and Master have washed your feet, so wash ye one another's feet."</P>
<P>Nevertheless, I believe these were outward signs, and manifested Christ's humility, which he wished them to pat∣tern after in the whole of their conduct, and tenor of their lives; not confined to washing of feet only, but that they
<PB N="10" REF="032807_0009_0FF528B49C8E41C8"/>
might be servants one to another. "Let him that will be great amongst you be the servant of all." O that ye, my friends, may set aside all the contentions concerning these things; let every man be persuaded in his own mind. But let us come to essential things, those things without which no man can be saved; let us search more after things that are certain, great, and fundamental points of doctrine, which I believe not only those that profess a faith in Christ, but that all men, of all nations, of every kingdom, tongue, and people—people that have the fewest advantages amongst the race of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, yet they have had this one advantage. The Lord has written his Law in their hearts, he has fulfilled his promise that he declared to his prophet, "I will write my law in their hearts, I will place it in their inward parts;" so that when we talk of men as of different nations, we shall find that they all agree, if they are men really seeking after the truth, and after that foundation which will bear them out when they come to put off mortality.</P>
<P>All men will acknowledge that the work of righteousness is peace, and the effect of righteousness, is quietness to the soul, and assurance for ever. <HI>All men acknowledge this.</HI> I have been amongst some men that have been called the most barbarous names, as savages. I have spent a great deal of time with them; aye, <HI>some months,</HI> and I found they had not been instructed, they had not had the great advantage that we have. The preaching of the Gospel was little known amongst them; yet clear outlines of what the Gos∣pel of Jesus Christ requires, were written upon their hearts; they could say in terms of equal importance, verily there is a reward to the righteous, verily there is a God that judg∣eth in the earth, verily we are accountable beings, verily there is a state of immortality; there is a blessed and happy one for those that, according to the best of their knowledge, serve the great Spirit in this world; who do no wrong to their neighbour, who live in God's fear, who lift up their
<PB N="11" REF="032807_0010_0FF528D64509F290"/>
hearts to him and implore his assistance. These are the sentiments the wild inhabitants of America are taught, whom we are pleased to call barbarians: so that (I believe) if men would keep to the foundation, if they would not scatter hither and thither after a variety of non-essential things, they would sooner be brought into greater harmony and union. For there is but one GOD over all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all? Aye, may some say, is he in us all? Why, there is nothing more con∣tinually enforced upon us, in all the Doctrine of the New Testament than God and Christ in us the hope of Glory; and I believe this is not a time for those who have the benefit of reading the Scriptures to deny this; it is a great benefit, a peculiar advantage which God has favoured us with, who profess the name of Christ; it would be a great advantage to some of you, my young friends, were you more acquainted therewith, if there was more delight in reading the Scriptures than there is in the present generation, and less delight in reading those things that make a jest of hea∣ven and hell, of GOD, and all things serious; I believe it would be a great advantage to many of the rising youth.</P>
<P>I know that I for many years so abused my time in read∣ing novels, romances, plays, and a variety of trumpery of this kind, that I had no relish for the Scriptures; and when I was brought to read the words, they were a sealed book to me; I saw nothing in them, I had no delight in them; I would take them up and lay them down, and knew nothing of their value.—So it is with many; it it so with an abundance, both in Europe and America; much time is spent upon trifles; upon those things that, instead of giving any real solid enjoyment, only tend to banish all those rational and well-founded pleasures and enjoyments which the Christian experiences.</P>
<P>This is my testimony, because I <HI>know</HI> what I <HI>say.</HI> I was for a number of years a slave to them: I know where they led me <HI>to,</HI> and I know where they led me <HI>from.</HI> But
<PB N="12" REF="032807_0011_0FF528BFC5F5D160"/>
thanks be to God, there is something which all men may experience, that will set their souls at rest; that will re∣lieve them from an anxiety after every burden of the pas∣sing hour.</P>
<P>A man that loves to contemplate, (and it is truly con∣sistent with the dignity of a rational being, that is here for a few years, and presently makes his exit and is seen no more) a man that can devote his leisure hours, to con∣template the nobility of his rank in creation, the majesty and greatness of that adorable Being who created all things by the word of his power, and who can contemplate that glorious scene that awaits the righteous, has more real en∣joyment than all the pleasures ushered into the world. And this I am persuaded of, that a private sober meditation, and an evening's walk of a wise man, thus informed, is indeed the highest gratification that noble and rational beings, as we are, can enjoy. And that in wherein I want you, my young friends, to set out right. In the early part of your youth, Search the Scriptures; they are books of inestimable value. One of the great men of this nation, who some ages ago was preparing to die, when he came to lay down his head upon his bed of sickness, and saw the awful hour of death was come—What were his lamentations and expressions? Why he said, O! that I had served my GOD as faithful as I have served my king; it would have been better for me now! He had been a great and famous statesman. Now, my friends, this was his expe∣rience, and it may not be incompatible with the Christian. Another of the same kind, whom I do not now recollect, but it was another man of eminence, that said, if he had his time to go over again in this world, he would spend much of it in reading David's Psalms and Paul's Epistles. And I wish you, my young friends, in this employ. Then you would find for yourselves that the doctrine therein contained would lead you to God's kingdom. You would find indeed that God was <HI>nigh</HI> unto you. He is not, "says
<PB N="13" REF="032807_0012_0FF5291148F04CB0"/>
Paul, afar off from any one of you, for in him ye move and have your being." This was their constant testimony. Nay, before the coming of Jesus Christ, they acknow∣ledged his divinity. And shall we go back and say it is no such thing?—Did not Socrates and Seneca, and many others, acknowledge the divinity was he that led them, that shewed them that they were immortal, and caused them to aspire after those things that would recommend them to the notice of God, and to great and everlasting peace? O! my friends, there are a cloud of witnesses from genera∣tion to generation that the Lord has raised up in this man∣ner to declare to the people, that He it was, and He it is, who is the true teacher of all wisdom, of all that wisdom which cometh down from him, which is pure, peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy, full of good fruit; and it is by this wisdom that we should be brought into the harmony that I have been speaking of. O! that men would wait for it, that they would ask for it, and that there were more who practised retirement in the world, and more sincerity of heart even in our prayers! for what is it to be saying, "Lord, Lord," from the cradle to the grave? If we are not desirous to be taught of him, and to do his will, what will it signify? Many in the hurry of life do not consider him sufficiently, but when they are brought to lay down upon a sick bed; O! how changed do things appear, in how different a point of view. I have been be∣fore many at death; I have visited the chambers of those that have been penitent; I have heard their expressions; many a time have I seen the work of the Lord upon them: How it hath changed them! One of the brightest young men that ever I knew, I may say, the delight of his ac∣quaintance; yea the pride of all gay company, who was the life, or as some say, the soul of every place he visited; for his gaiety, humour, and wit—O! the Lord in his wis∣dom did not suffer him to remain in this way, but laid his hand upon him; and laid him upon a sick bed, and when he was there, such was the state of this bright young man,
<PB N="14" REF="032807_0013_0FF528C15B5102F0"/>
that, when he was brought to see that he had not many days to continue in this stage, he required to see some whom he thought were Religious, and when he saw them, O! how his heart was tortured! and what were his expressions? why upon this wise, "I, (says he) have seen abundance; I know men and things, I have passed through and been at different Courts, I have tasted a great deal of what the world calls enjoyments in this earth; I have been educated in some religious principles; but I saw that they were too narrow for me, they confined me too much, there was not room and liberty enough for me; I read BOLINGBROKE, HUME, and PAINE, and I had almost encouraged myself therein. But now it has pleased the Lord to bring me upon this bed of sickness; I know I have a Physician, but no medical aid can help me now, my friends." I went to him, I found him wet with tears; he told me his former companions neglected him; and he said, if they had not neglected me, they would have yield∣ed me no comfort; they would have been stings to my conscience, and as daggers to my heart, because I have been in their state. Now, said he, what would you have me do in this situation? O, said he, I want to believe, but I have been so dark, and encouraged these principles so long, that I cannot believe as I ought to do. Well, this was truly a sorrowful and affecting scene to me, and so it would have been to many if they had been present. The Lord, no doubt, is rich in mercy, and I trust he visited his soul, even the last few days of his life; and to him I com∣mit it. I cannot say that infinite Love did not even at that late hour accept him. But O! my friends, let us, while we have strength and liberty, let us with all our hearts apply them to those things which will be something to lean upon in such an hour! For this indeed is the end of all Religion, talk of it as long as we may; so to live as not to be afraid to die; that we may so die when it shall please the Lord to separate us from this body that we may live before him for ever!</P>

<HEAD>The second Discourse of W. Savery.</HEAD>
<P>There are certain obligations that are the same in all Na∣tions and Countries; and I would not have you believe, my friends, that when I spoke of the outward and typical things, such as washing, such as abstaining from blood and things strangled, which are not observed in the present day by a large number of Christians, that I meant to censure any part of the moral Law. No: I believe it never can be dispensed with; but the whole of those things that the councils of Jerusalem forbad, are forbidden in all nations as an eternal decree. I thought I might so far explain upon this head, as I do not know, my dear friends, when it may please the Lord to bring me with you again. I feel my heart bound in affection to many of the Citizens of London, I wish their everlasting welfare; I seek not you, nor any thing that is yours to myself; but all men and my own soul also, to God; that we may with reverence of soul seek him if happily we may find him; that those that are convinced by the light of Christ in their consciences, of what their duty is to God, may, with child-like submission and obe∣dience to his holy will, conform to it in all things; for if it has pleased God to enlighten thee in any matter or thing, as soon as he is pleased to shew thee what thou oughtest to do, and thou neglectest thy duty therein, then thou be∣comest condemnable before him; no man will be condemn∣ed for that which God hath not shewn him; but I believe it is possible for men to neglect the means of obtaining the knowledge of the will of God. Not being serious enough, not seeking it in the way it is to be found. Not asking wis∣dom of him who gives liberally to all men and upbraideth none. Our all is at stake. If I am an enthusiast in these things, the Lord preserve me an enthusiast to the end of my days. I believe that the whole world, and all the ad∣vantages that any can obtain, will be indeed as the smallest dust in the balance against the salvation of the immortal foul: therefore it is that I am serious, and concerned for my
<PB N="16" REF="032807_0015_0FF52944E80A07D0"/>
own soul and for those of others. And I believe that if those who are convinced of the ways of Truth and Righ∣teousness, if they with simplicity of soul acknowledge the truth, and live in the truth of the divine law, they will not only have a gladdening hope of a glorious immortality in the world to come; but they will also be favoured with an hundred fold of peace and joy in this life. I think I know it from some degree of experience, I never knew what true and real enjoyment was in the Lord's temporal blessings, till it pleased him to touch my heart and bring me to a sense of my state, and of obedience to him. I am firmly persuaded that the way the Lord Jesus Christ has cast up for those that will finally be heirs of his kingdom, is neither gloomy, nor improper for a reasonable, sensible, dignify'd mind to walk in; there is liberty enough, there is room enough; we do not want to rob you of any thing; nei∣ther did your Redeemer and Saviour, that was truly valuable even in the enjoyment of the present world, not of any tem∣poral blessing which God has granted; the true and solid enjoyment of them is found only by a truly religious mind. O! the glorious liberty there is in the truth as it is in <HI>Jesus!</HI> What are all the opinions of men in comparison of it? how trifling, how light, their senseless contradictions; they are ever changing! There is, my friends, a glorious and bless∣ed liberty in the truth as it is in Jesus, that I would to God all men might enjoy; that so his Church might once more put on her beautiful garments: that all those uncharitable dispositions which are harboured by some, though I hope in this enlightened day, not by a great many, may be removed; God is doing them away, seeking thus his own work; he is abolishing those things which kept us so long at a distance secretly, and will bring them to nought; this is my opini∣on; and more and more charity will prevail: let us cherish, let us with one accord be willing to live in it, and to die in it; then indeed shall we embrace one another as brethren. There will be no such thing as hurting, or doing one ano∣ther an injury: the peaceable kingdom of Jesus Christ our
<PB N="17" REF="032807_0016_0FF528D96587CDA8"/>
Saviour, being established and set up in the hearts of men, would put an end to WAR, and all the horrors append∣ing to it in the world. O! that men might once more embrace one another as brethren, and enjoy the glorious liberty of children of one common family.</P>

<P>I hope it will not lessen the Solemnity, which is ma∣nifest in this meeting, by expressing the desire which attends my mind upon the behalf of visited minds that are present; which is, that they may bear in remembrance the declaration of an experienced servant of Christ; that, that which is to be known of God, is manifested in man; for God hath shewed it unto him. Now this, according to my apprehension, points to the necessity of withdrawing our dependance from all inferiour objects, and waiting upon God, that we also may attain to the experience of being instructed by him. And the more we become instructed of him; the more we shall be guarded against those, and looking after those, against whom our blessed Lord for∣merly cautioned his visited followers; when he declares that many would come in his name, calling their attention outward; "lo, (says he) I have told you before, many should come in my name, and say, lo here is Christ: and others, lo there is Christ: but I say unto you, Go not forth after them." Here is doctrine, my friends, do not look <HI>out</HI> for that which is to be known <HI>within.</HI> "Go not forth after them;" for, (says he) "the kingdom of God is with∣in you." Now here is a number present, I have no doubt, who are often addressing him in words, and repeating over and over again, "Thy kingdom come:"—But where are we, my dear friends, looking for his kingdom? Cannot you believe him who has thus declared, "The Kingdom of God is within you?" It consists in the government of his Spirit. And therefore when ye say, "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done upon earth, as it is in heaven," are ye sincerely
<PB N="18" REF="032807_0017_0FF529580958FD78"/>
desirous of having your minds and affections brought under the government of his holy Spirit? Do not you remember, when he was about to be taken away from his disciples and followers, in the time of his outward appearance, where he says, "If I go not away the comforter will not come; but if I go away, I pray unto the Father, and he shall send another comforter, even the spirit of Truth. And when that spirit shall come, he shall reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness and of judgment." Now this is what we wait for in our times of retirement, "When he the spirit of truth shall come, he shall bring all things that I have told you to your remembrance; and will lead you and guide you into all truth." Now my dear friends, look at these things, and bear them in remembrance in your hours of retirement, when separated one from another. Do not look outward: remember that which is to be known of God is manifested in man: for there God will reveal it to you in his own way and in his own time. And let your obedience keep pace with your knowledge; for the kingdom of God consists not in meats and drinks, and in outward ordinances, but in righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost; for the work of righteousness is peace, and the effect of it will be at last quietness and assurance with God for ever.</P>

<P>THE present is an age of many uncommon events, and the curious observer will not be inattentive to what they tend; and indeed many are filled with conjectures where these things will end. It is a day also, wherein men of science have been exceedingly curious in their re∣searches; they have brought up some new and before unheard of things to view: and probably some of them may be turned to advantage to their country, in ages to come, though they are not now altogether usefully employed in the world.</P>
<P>But I have been thinking, my friends, of one Science worth them all; for if men were even to possess the power of counting all the luminaries of heaven, and to measure the magnitude of all the heavenly bodies, even of those that lay beyond the reach of the present observers; if they knew all the hidden arcana of nature, what would it avail, if they were destitute of the knowledge of God and themselves?</P>
<Q>Know ye not your own selves<NOTE PLACE="foot">2 Corinthians, xiii. 5.</NOTE>?</Q>
<P>So said the Apostle. A great lesson: One of a later time had this reflection upon it,
<Q>"Man know thyself, enough for man to know."</Q></P>
<P>Now I conceive, my friends, here is a wide field unex∣plained by many; and wherein I am convinced the richest treasure is to be found; the most worthy of all knowledge; viz. the knowledge of God and ourselves. Yea "to know Thee the only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent, is life eternal." Jesus the Son and Sent of GOD. Well, my friends, there is no doubt but that there are a number present, who at times have been employed in this most im∣portant and serious enquiry. But there are many men who can spend day after day, and year after year, in labour and search almost indefatigable, without being weary, in things that concern only this short and uncertain state of
<PB N="22" REF="032807_0020_0FF52918E21A2210"/>
being; who are not patient enough, to devote the same time, the same attention, the same dedication of their fa∣culties and powers which God has given them to the most important and enriching of all sciences.</P>
<P>And this is, my friends, what I have been lamenting both in my own country and in this. For I believe, as surely as the great Creator and Ruler of the universe has granted us powers and talents for the most glorious and dignified pur∣poses, so, I believe, that one day all men will be brought to an account of their stewardship. The infidel in time of health smiles at this! "But, (this I acknowledge) though men may live fools, yet fools they cannot die." Men, while they are diverting themselves, in the passing enjoyments of the present life, however vain and little, and below the dig∣nity of their nature, may be so amused, and suffer them so to take up their faculties and powers, that they may never be in a capacity to think and feel sufficiently after the most solid and important thing. Certainly, my friends, this is a cause of sorrow to every thinking mind; and I know that it is, and ever must be, a cause of real affliction to every gospel minister; who believes in the sacred and unchangeable truths which have every confirmation, that reasonable minds could dare to ask, or that was necessary for the wise and beneficent GOD to give. (this is my faith) Thus ministers, I am persuaded, under every name, pro∣fessing Christianity, must behold with sorrow their fellow pilgrims travelling towards an endless eternity; involved in things below, and unfit for those that they ought to be employed in, laying up a foundation against the time to come; that so they may lay hold of eternal Life. For I conceive there are very few, perhaps none at all, that could entertain a belief that they are not immortal.
<Q>"If Man is not immortal, GOD'S unjust,"</Q>
so said one, a pious writer, "to send him in this world in the condition that we see him, even in his best estate." For verily, as said one of the ancient Scripture
<PB N="23" REF="032807_0021_0FF528C2F1CE7148"/>
writers, "Every man in his best estate is vanity," take him in whatsoever condition of life you may. Those that are in the enjoyment of so much of this world's goods that they can compass every pleasure (falsely so called) that the world and all its auxiliaries can give, know they no moments of sadness? my persuasion is they have many. A man of <HI>pleasure</HI> is a man of <HI>pain:</HI> this may appear a paradox, but it is no more than true. Those that are lovers of plea∣sure, more than lovers of God, are in every condition of human life, men of pain. The infirmity of a man's body the spirit of a man can bear, but a wounded spirit who can bear? There are many who can support with much fortitude and patience, lingering pain of body; they can meet death with some apparent degree of composure and fortitude, provided always that the sting of death be drawn, not else; if a man is in his rational understanding. For the common infirmities of a man, the spirit of a man can bear; but a wounded spirit who can bear?</P>
<P>Well, my friends, it is in great mercy that the Lord wounds us: it is not thou that woundest thyself. An house divided against itself can never stand. Dost thou thine own self condemn thyself? No: it is as clear as any axiom in Eu∣clid; it cannot be, it is impossible; an house divided against itself can never stand. What is it that condemns, what is it that disquiets, what is it that unsettles and confuses the mind of those that have been guilty of enormous crimes? What is it that causes the murderer to fly from country to country, and find no resting place for the sole of his feet; no bed soft enough for him to repose upon? I say it is <HI>Con∣science.</HI> What is CONSCIENCE? The voice of GOD, I say, in thy soul: this is conscience.—The same voice that called to Adam, when he had transgressed the commandment of his Creator; "Adam, where art thou?" Adam was weak enough to conceive he could conceal himself from Him that had even made the earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters! "Adam, where art thou?" Why be knew that
<PB N="24" REF="032807_0022_0FF528F99C82B8A8"/>
he had transgressed the command of God, and he was afraid: "I heard thy voice, and was afraid." Well, so may every sinner, great or little; and know this is the cause of their fears: "I heard thy voice and was afraid." It is in vain, I conceive, for men to talk of the principles of their education; those things are as women's tales; they are old as the creation of the world we live in; and will remain, I believe, until the firmament shall be dissolved as with fer∣vent heat, and earth and all that are therein again dissolve. This is my faith: and all the wise and all the good have borne testimony similar to this; that have written, and that have spoken in the various ages of mankind; they have borne testimony to the Law of God written in their hearts. How futile, how weak for men to talk of divisions and sub∣divisions in these things! to speak of natural conscience; and the same futility in their arguments, in their lessons, and in those convulsions that there are when we see the great, awful and tremendous works of God that appear in the earth; to say it is Nature!—</P>
<P>How futile, for men not to look up through nature to na∣ture's GOD, to confuse and confound themselves and one another. This is my faith, and I do not want you to re∣ceive it any further than it may coincide with the best light and knowledge which God in his mercy has granted you. I do not want you to pin your faith upon mine. No: we seek not man's silver, nor gold, nor applause, nor any thing that is their's: we call not the people together to amuse them with fine words, and fine speeches, but with that phi∣lanthrophy which ever ought and ever must accompany the mind of a true gospel minister; and will induce him (if he has really been benefited by the knowledge of GOD himself) to desire with ardour of soul that all men may come to the same experience. I have reason to say, God be thank∣ed, for me who was in darkness as thick as any of my con∣temporaries, concerning God, and the things of God, swallowed up in inticing pleasures, and vanities of this life,
<PB N="25" REF="032807_0023_0FF528A4B594F6F8"/>
as much as many of you, and perhaps most of you, and as far from the knowledge of that peace which passes all natu∣ral reason and understanding of men, as any could be. Thanks be to God, who is wise, who never leaves any of us in this state, without compunction of soul, from season to season: who follows us in the night revels, who follows us into the halls of licentiousness, who follows us in the midst of our gay career with our companions, and wounds our most joyful scenes—this I am clear of: so that in the midst of laughter I can freely acknowledge, I have been still sad —because my heart was sad. "I heard thy voice and was afraid."</P>
<P>Well, my friends, there is a great deal said about religion in the world; men have (shall I say) hewn out a variety of systems, that have been strong in their inventions, and various in the powers which God has given them, to reason upon, each one upon their own system. It is not systems nor opinions—It is neither high church nor low church that I am speaking about now. There is but one true and living church, the whole world over. Men may call themselves what they please: the world calls me a <HI>Quaker</HI>—and thee a <HI>Dissenter</HI> in another form—and thee a member of the <HI>Established Church</HI>—But what is all this? My friends, these are names, they are distinctions amongst men: but are they distinctions with God? Does he know <HI>high</HI> church, and <HI>low</HI> church? Does he descend to inquire whether thou art a <HI>methodist</HI> or a <HI>presbyterian,</HI> thou a <HI>baptist,</HI> thou a <HI>roman catholic?</HI> No: But is thy <HI>heart</HI> right? Art thou sincere in thy desires to know him and to serve him? This is the great point: to know him, and to know thine ownself; the situation in which he has placed thee, who is the Author of thy being; the reason he has given to thee that <HI>Being,</HI> and the glory which he proposes to crown it with, if thou wilt, with simplicity of heart, live in his counsel, and in his fear, and avoid those things that are repugnant to God's purity, with
<PB N="26" REF="032807_0024_0FF5293EA4892A28"/>
a pure and truly enlightened mind. Men have too long been tossed about those things, I am persuaded of it; and a day, I am glad to hope, is speedily advancing, when there shall be little heard of it in the world. The sword of per∣secution is in a great measure (through the Lord's mercy) staid; and yet there is room for it to be more closely sheathed. I believe men are coming back to think for themselves; to feel for themselves as they ought to do; to inquire after the truth; not of leaders of sects or parties, and of men ap∣pointed for to lead them in a certain way—but to inquire after it wisely—independant one upon another—and de∣pendant only, in this point, upon God, the fountain of all wisdom and knowledge. (This is my belief.)</P>
<P>So that, my friends, as I said before, I am not come among you to gather you to <HI>my</HI> party; but that all men may become so inquisitive for themselves, that they may be joined to GOD and CHRIST in their part. For there are, I am persuaded in my own experience, men that I have found both in this country and in my own country, (where all men are free to possess and believe whatever they please, as to opinions of religion) I say there are those among the various professors, whom I can embrace as children of one great and universal Parent, in the truth, as it is in Jesus.</P>
<P>So that it cannot be—it would be contrary to charity that I should seem to be bigoted to any party upon earth; but I want that all men should search and see for them∣selves! "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh unto you as he did in the primitive ages to the primitive be∣lievers. He was known of the patriarchs; He was known of the prophets; He was known of the apostles; they knew that He was in them; they knew His power created all things; they knew He filled all things; "He is not far (says the learned Paul) from any of you, for in Him ye live, move, and have your being." But He perceived the learned Athenians, who were exceeding wise in their day, he per∣ceived that when he passed by their altar how dark they
<PB N="27" REF="032807_0025_0FF528BE2C44BF98"/>
were in the most essential of all sciences. "For (says he) I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious:" for as I passed by your altar, I saw this inscription upon it— "TO THE UNKNOWN GOD"—and "that God, whom ye ignorantly worship, declare I unto you." This was the business of the apostle amongst both Jew and Gentile; they were not ashamed to confess their opinion, yea even in the Athenian courts among the great philosophers. Yea many philosophers, even before the coming of Jesus Christ in the world, declared to the same divine principle, that I believe would unite all men in the ground and bottom of one substantial ever-enduring felicity.—They declared (we may read divers of them)—they spoke of the Divinity that there was ONE that enlightened their minds to know good from evil, and that inspired them to do things that were worthy of their dignity as men and immortals.—They frequently testified to that holy principle, which, after all, is the ground-work of all religion in every sort of people; even in idolatrous nations. For JESUS CHRIST came not par∣tially to enlighten one, and no other part: He was "The Word that was in the beginning; that was with God, and that was God"—and that was afterwards made flesh, ac∣cording to the will of the father, who could as easily have sent him in that body to every corner of the world (we may readily suppose) and a thousand times more so to na∣tural conceptions, for all things are easy to him as the Creator of the world, and all things that are therein. But I say he came to enlighten the world with a greater degree of light than ever was before—to bring light and immor∣tality more abundantly to life in the world. And a great and especial favour I account it to be. And I believe the more we are acquainted with the Scriptures, the more we shall all be made to acknowledge, they are a special favour of God to mankind: containing, in the simplicity of their doctrine, the most deep and heavenly mysteries; and sublime beyond all the writings of any philosophers in the world, be they ever so great; or any that are called divines: yea,
<PB N="28" REF="032807_0026_0FF5292B008A7168"/>
they are simply, and virtually in their doctrines, truly sub∣lime beyond all the soaring opinions of men! I want the present generation therefore to read for themselves. Search the Scriptures for yourselves: let no man come unto you, and say, "I have studied them for many years—I have seen them in many languages—and I can instruct you better than you can be otherwise instructed;" for depend upon it, they have some end to answer, let them come and say what they may. Because the same eternal Spirit that gave all the mysteries that ever were revealed to mankind, to the prophets or the apostles, or any of the ministers whatever, remains to be resorted to this day, the same as in that day; and the same eternal Spirit must open the Scriptures that gave them: for nothing inferior to the power that gave the glorious and blessed doctrine of the New Testament, can reveal and open them to thy understanding and mine; not all the men of science in the world, I am persuaded: for we see it really and truly fulfilled, the Lord has confounded the wisdom of the wise, and brought to nought the understanding of the prudent, when they have meddled with these things. One saying, this is the true interpretation; and another saying, that is the true interpretation; and another saying as it were, I am wiser than thou. Oh, what confusion has happened amongst the poor professors of Christianity, wherever this has been the case! Now here are some with the Scriptures in their hands (and, indeed, there is one got over into my nation, where I live, that is leading the people by the ear, with the Scripture in his hand, endeavouring to prove things diametrically inconsistent with the very book that he holds forth!) My friends, how is it, or where shall we find TRUTH? I see the people are scattered exceedingly by it; some run for a season after one man, and they say, "This is the man; and now (say they) I have found him; I never heard one before like this man:" and in a few months (they being unstable as water) they are cast another way:—and then another comes and says abundance of fine things, who is very learned and very ele∣gant,
<PB N="29" REF="032807_0027_0FF529295F2ABAB0"/>
and they say, "This man is come to this place, we will go and hear him." Alas, alas! how this is descending from the dignity in which we were created, and from the resource which God has granted; for "God is Light, and in him is no darkness at all;" he is the light of the world, and the life of men; the light that has enlightened, and will enlighten, every man and woman that cometh into the world." So that the prophets before the coming of Jesus Christ, could say in confidence, beholding the glorious days in which we live, and which some of them desired to see, for many prophets and righteous men have desired to see one of these days which ye see, but could not; yet with an eye of faith they beheld it afar off: "Abraham saw my day (says Christ) and rejoiced:" Why, how could Abraham see his day, but through the inshining of that glorious light which gave him to see the things which God, in the riches of his mercy and wisdom, was designing to do in the earth? This is the spirit of prophecy.</P>
<P>Well, my friends, have we all received a measure of this light? "If any man says that he has not the spirit of Christ, then he is none of his. That which is to be known of God is manifested in man," says the apostle.</P>
<P>How plain, how simple are these doctrines! Is it any wonder that the prophets and the apostles, who were inspir∣ed of God, should speak in this manner of the gospel day: That we have no need that any man teach us—that "we have no need that any man should say to his brother, or to his neighbour, know thou the Lord; for all men shall know HIM from the least to the greatest of them." For "I will write my law in their hearts, I will place it in their inward parts; they shall be my people, and I will be their GOD."</P>
<P>Now this is the doctrine, my friends, which the apostles preached—and it is the faith which we contend for. We have no new doctrine to preach unto the world, but the
<PB N="30" REF="032807_0028_0FF52882DBC563E8"/>
same that has passed the test of many ages, the same that the holy men of God continued to declare both before and after the apostles, and that has been confirmed throughout all the Scripture. This is the faith that the apostle spoke of, when he made mention what faith it was that he con∣tended for. He said he had no need to say, "who shall ascend up into heaven, that is, to bring Christ down from thence, or who shall descend into the depth, that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead. The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: and this is the word of faith that we preach;" and no other word of faith can ever be preached consistent with the gospel of Christ; and this adhered to, my friends, would be sufficient to re∣concile all the contradictory differences that are in the world. They would be taught one and the same thing— it would put an end to all evil censuring one another. It would put an end to all persecutions; to all prejudices one against another; to all boasting one against another, as though I was more holy than thou; as if my system was better than thine, and I was nearer the kingdom of heaven than thou art—all being taught of this divine, eternal, all-sufficient WORD. The people would speak the same lan∣guage: this I am persuaded of. But while they remain to be in the manner that many are, saying, "I am for Paul, I am for Apollos, and I am for Cephas," and are not wil∣ling to be gathered to be of Christ—for, as said the apostle, "Was Paul crucified for you?—Is Christ divided?" Can there be any divisions in his church? No; I conceive not. There can be no rents and schisms; Christ and his church being united, they are one in him. And where they are one in him, a glorious and blessed unity will subsist, for "one is your master, and all ye are brethren."—Then there would be no contention for superiority in the church: no such thing; it would be impossible. For if any one of you would be the greatest of all, let him become the servant of all. This would be the way to be great in the church of Christ. For it remains to be the same now that it was in
<PB N="31" REF="032807_0029_0FF5287DD28EABE0"/>
the days of Christ's flesh; the way to be the greatest is to be the most humble; to be the most virtuous; to be full of love and charity towards our fellow-creatures and our fellow-probationers. I say, this is the only true way to seek dignity in the Church. There would be no aspiring after great places and employments in it. Though I have charity to believe that even some who have been called dig∣nitaries of the Church (for indeed the Lord bears with many of our weaknesses and infirmities) have been zealous and honest contenders for the Faith, as far as it pleased HIM to enlighten them. But I am confident of this in my mind, that the day is hastening, wherein there will be one Shepherd, and one Sheepfold, the whole world over. For this is the true nature of the gospel dispensation. But, oh, alas! what does it appear to be in this day?—How different from the primitive state, when it was declared, that, "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, <HI>if ye have love one to another."</HI> Well, look over Christendom at this day: Does the Mahometan behold our light as it shines? When they take the Testament in their own hands, they are as wise to discern as we are; they are men of the same powers, and possess the same faculties to com∣pare things as we do. Well, what would an honest Ma∣hometan say? "Thou endeavourest to convert me to be a Christian: but for what purpose? Are the Christians wiser—Are they better—Are they more virtuous than an honest Mussulman? Give me an instance of it. Do they love one another better than the Mahometans?"</P>
<P>Well, my friends, do not be afraid of this inquiry, it is the way to truth; it is the way we must examine things; and, as I said before, it is a day of inquiry: let us not be afraid of inquiry. Men have been afraid of bringing things to the test. But I believe it will not be sufficient to think so long: and I invite you that are men of freedom, of independent minds, search for the truth for yourselves. Let no man lead you in those things which God is sufficient to
<PB N="32" REF="032807_0030_0FF5288D8DA506D8"/>
direct and lead you into himself, who is the Fountain of all wisdom and knowledge; who has given thee powers and fa∣culties to discern thy way, and to judge what he has called thee into existence for; what is thy business in thy passing through the present transient state of being, so that thou mayest inherit eternal life.</P>
<P>O Christendom! thou oughtest to be a light to enlighten the Heathen, and a glory; aye, the glory of GOD, to the ends of the earth! How they must look upon us! For even the Mahometans, having the New Testament in their hands, how must they stand amazed, when they come to compare these things with that our great Leader said: "By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, because ye love one another." And are there any people more at dis∣cord?—Are there any more at variance either in a private or in a publick national capacity?—O! how this has wound∣ed me!—bear with me, my friends, I do not wish to hurt any mind present by any means whatever. If thou thinkest not as I think, thou wilt not be judged by my conscience; but by the light thou hast received thyself. And if thine heart condemn thee not, then wilt thou have faith and hope towards God; and I condemn thee not neither: but while we are endeavouring to seek after truth, do not let us be afraid of coming to the knowledge of it.</P>
<P>But, my friends, let us see whereabouts we are—If the foundation of God stands where it used to be; whether <HI>we</HI> are really upon the same unchangeable foundation which the apostles were? And if we are, then we may be in the same glorious and holy confidence which they were; we may rejoice with a hope that will not fail us in the hour of death; and that we shall receive a crown of immortality, if we are building as they built; and if we are adhering to the same ground of faith which they did. Well then, some may say, they have examined these things. It will not do us any hurt to examine them over and over again. TRUTH is precious, and no matter how much time is spent
<PB N="33" REF="032807_0031_0FF52892ACDD36D8"/>
in investigating of it. For, sure I am, if the gospel spirit had been continued to this day, thousands and ten thousands that have fell in the field of battle would not have died in that way, and the carnage and devastation that desolated so many parts of Europe would have been prevented. O the cry of the widows and the tender orphans in the several countries of Europe! Ought this to have been? Or would it ever have been, if men had kept to the principle which taught them not only to love their brethren, but to love their <HI>enemies;</HI> to do good to them that persecuted them, and that despitefully used them; that so they might be the children of their heavenly Father, who causeth the rain to descend, and the sun to shine, both upon the just and the unjust.</P>
<P>"Why (some may say) Do not talk of things impossi∣ble. Is it possible for a man to be brought into such a condition as not to revenge injuries and insults?" I be∣lieve it is; and that it is the disposition that every Christian ought to be brought into—not to revenge injuries and in∣sults, but to bear them with patience.</P>
<P>Some may here say, "What wouldst thou have us to be <HI>cowards?"</HI> No; but <HI>heroes</HI> in the LAMB'S army. And who is there that needs be ashamed to be in the LAMB'S army, to gain the victory? It would be a thousand times more magnanimous indeed to put up with little injuries, one with another, than to resent them in anger; it shows a low and little mind to do that; great minds are above it. And the Christian sees a state exalted far beyond this, and that we are even called to it, the very form of our prayer testifies: "If thou forgivest not those that trespass against thee, (our blessed Lord said) neither will thy Father which is in heaven forgive thee." These are solid and unshaken Truths, that all the sophistry of men will never be able to invalidate.—<HI>"Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us"</HI>—Who then can say this prayer, and still continue in a spirit of revenge; and say to his brother, an eye
<PB N="34" REF="032807_0032_0FF5296239297FC8"/>
for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth; thou hast injured me, and I will injure thee? Well, then those ought to be care∣ful upon what terms they lay their salvation; for the Lord is here prescribing the very terms in his excellent prayer, "Forgive us our trespasses, only as we forgive them that trespass against us: this is the true meaning of the prayer. No further prayest thou when thou usest the prayer given by our blessed Lord himself. But, my friends, though I do not want to enlarge a great deal, I want to see the peaceable stan∣dard of righteousness exalted, both in this nation and in all the nations of the earth; and that the spirit of persecution and destroying of one another might be entirely done away, by all being brought down into the meek spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ; and be, in some measure, as he was, when he was persecuted even to death on the cross. (O how meekly he bore it for our sake!—And shall we not bear with one another? I trust all will confess we ought to do.) He said in the depth of his agony, "Father forgive them:" though he could have called down legions of Angels to those corrupt and wicked men; yet he said in meekness (which I believe many have partook of, in a measure, since this day) "Father forgive them, for they know not what they do." And the next martyr, Stephen, when he was brought to the gates of the city, and was stoned to death, he followed his Lord in the same disposition; he kneeled down when in the midst of them, and said, "Lord lay not this sin to their charge." Having lifted up his eyes to heaven, and peti∣tioned his Saviour to receive his soul, he at last said, "Lord lay not this sin to their charge:" and so saying, he fell asleep in the arms, no doubt, of his glorious Lord and Master, whom he followed even to death.</P>
<P>Now, my friends, there is no new law; there is no new dispensation. Many of the martyrs were of the same faith, which they had attained through God's mercy, and the in∣fluence of his Spirit upon theirs; and the same disposition of mind also. So that when they were led forth in the
<PB N="35" REF="032807_0033_0FF5288F256516F0"/>
days of persecution, which the church was persecuted with, O how meek did some of them deliver up their souls to God, and their bodies into the hands of their wretched persecu∣tors! There were some hundreds of them fell a sacrifice for their faith and belief in God. How pious, how calm did they go out of the world! Not reviling because they were reviled: By no means. Not giving abuse for abuse, but contrariwise, blessing their persecutors. This was the condition of those, knowing (as the apostle said) they were thereunto called, that they might also inherit a blessing.</P>
<P>Well, my friends, these are so many monuments of God's adorable mercy and power: and the same God reigneth over all in this day; and he is as able to support us in the faith once delivered to the Saints, as he was in that day: and I trust those that are earnestly concerned to inquire after it, will know it to their comfort, without the aid or assistance of any man whatever. GOD is as sufficient for these things now as he was in all the generations that are past. It only wants application of mind—Serious solemn meditation, and contemplation upon the things of God; then all would know the Truth, and abiding in it, they would all be made preachers of Right∣eousness in their several situations in the world. Aye, one of those that was persecuted, when she was brought before her persecutors to answer for her faith, was nevertheless furnished with that wisdom which confounded the wisdom of the wise that was amongst her persecutors; so that they thought she had answered wiser than them all. And a cer∣tain little maid, when many were brought forth to the stake, was brought before her persecutors, they said to her, "And what can you say, my little maid, for your faith?" Why, said she, "I am not able to contend for CHRIST; but I am able to do more: I am able to suffer for Christ." Now, my friends, I am persuaded this would be the con∣dition of all of us; by inward, solid, reverent inquiry after
<PB N="36" REF="032807_0034_0FF529704016DF78"/>
it. Then you would not be astonished to see people sit down in silence, either in their own houses, or in the Assembly of God's people; so that God would condescend to be with them, and enlighten their minds. For "if any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth liberally, and up∣braideth none." O may the God of all mercy, wisdom, and power, hasten this day; enlarge the love of professors of Christianity one towards another: throw down all the walls of opposition, which were built up in the day of departure from the fountain of living water; and bring us again to drink at Shiloh's stream; that all the heritage may drink at the fountain itself; and the world once more rejoice in knowing him to reign and to rule over all; whose right it is, and ever will remain.</P>

<HEAD>The Prayer before the Sermon.</HEAD>
<P>O THOU great adorable Being, who art exalted in Goodness, and Majesty, and in Power, beyond all finite comprehension, who dwellest in the light where∣unto none can approach thee, but as thou art pleased in thine adorable mercy to open an access to us; and though Heaven is thy Throne, O God, and Earth is thy footstool, yet we remember that thou hast promised that thou wilt condescend to look down upon the poor, and upon the contrite, and those that tremble at thy word.</P>
<P>O Thou, unsearchable in holiness, and glorious in power, we pray thee to look down upon the present congregation this evening, with an eye of compassion and divine pity. Thou beholdest all men wheresoever they are scattered upon the face of the whole earth, with an equal eye of mercy, and thou hearest the prayers of all those who draw nigh unto thee with sincerity. Be pleased, O God, to cause thy animating presence to be with us, to bring the minds of all the people into an holy solemnity before thee. We know, O God, that no man can promote thy glorious Cause of Truth and Righteousness in the earth, but as thou art pleased to be with him, and to furnish him with the necessary qualifications for the great and important work whereunto thou art calling thy servants and ministers. O blessed Father, forsake them not, but be pleased, as in generations that are past, to pour forth thy Spirit upon thy ministers, that, in that wisdom which thou art pleased to grant from season to season, they may go forth in thy name, with the Word of Reconciliation and Faith.</P>
<P>O Lord, Thou hast many souls that are wandering up and down this great and populous country, who are seek∣ing after thy glorious and blessed rest, which thou alone canst lead them into the enjoyment of. We humbly and
<PB N="40" REF="032807_0037_0FF5296473158B90"/>
reverently pray thee, O God, to draw the minds of the people more and more off from thy ministers to thyself. O gracious God, unseal the fountain whereat thy prophets, thy apostles, thy servants, in all generations, have so freely drank and been filled. Cause those that hunger and thirst after righteousness to be more and more filled at thy boun∣tiful table; that so, Father, there may be among all ranks of the people more of the knowledge of thee, and more of an increase in following after thee in the way to everlasting rest.</P>
<P>O God, thou seest how weak we are; how surrounded with infirmities, how blinded with prejudices, how turned aside by a variety of fluctuating opinions; cause, we pray thee, thy holy uniting Word to be read more and more in the hearts of the people. Sound the alarm, we pray thee, yet louder and louder to them that are at ease and forgetful of thee: that so, Father, there may be many more brought to drink at the fountain of thy Goodness and Mercy, and with reverence of soul to acknowledge that thou art good, and worthy to be worshipped here, and to be obeyed and served by all the workmanship of thy hands. O gracious Father, proclaim a sign in this assembly, while with one accord, in humility of soul, which thou hast granted us, we may draw nigh unto thee, and offer up at this time for all thy former mercies, and for thy present mercies; and gather us together in this manner, O Father, ascribing unto thee glory and honour, thanksgiving and praise, which are thy due, both now and for evermore.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="sermon">
<PB REF="032807_0038_0FF5188733C65178"/>
<P>THERE are some weighty and interesting expressions which we find in the Revelation of John<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Revelations xiv. 7, 8.</NOTE>, that appear to be my duty, since I last took my seat, to mention in this assembly.</P>
<P><Q>And I (John) saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, saying with a loud voice, <HI>"Fear GOD</HI> and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgment is come; and worship Him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</Q></P>
<P>Now John, we find, calls this <HI>the everlasting gospel;</HI> which seems to be comprised in a very short and compendious manner; which no man in all this congregation, I trust, can be at a loss to understand. And though, my friends, we may he something various in our opinions concerning modes, manner and forms of worship, yet I believe there are very few of God's rational creation any where, either amongst those who are professing the name of Jesus Christ, or those that have not been favoured to be acquainted with the gospel as we are, but are sensible that To God belongs glory, honour, and worship; who behold him as the great and universal parent, the glorious, blessed and all-wise Ar∣chitect of the universe, and all things that are therein, and that sustains all things by the word of his invincible power; for the same almighty creating word that brought all things into the glorious order in which we see them, that said, let there be light, and there was light—No man can dispute but he at his pleasure also could again say, let there be darkness, and there would have been darkness: Again, let the heavenly luminaries depart from their appointed spheres,
<PB N="42" REF="032807_0039_0FF52890BB4DF9F0"/>
and let all things resort to their primitive rest, and it would undoubtedly have been done. So that he is not only the cause of all things, but the gracious supporter, daily and hourly sustainer of all that he has made, without whose blessed providence there is not an ear of corn or blade of grass could possibly be produced. So that, my friends, a daily dependance upon that GOD who created us— all his creation calls for, and with every solid and re∣flecting mind it will naturally produce, an offering of wor∣ship, adoration, and praise; and I am glad in believing, my friends, that here are in this large multitude a con∣siderable number who worship GOD in spirit and in truth; though differently educated, and of various opinions in things of little importance, but in the great, important, and essential point of every man's duty, speak the same lan∣guage; and I believe, my friends, this is the case both with the nations that are called <HI>refined,</HI> and with those that are termed <HI>barbarians.</HI> GOD has placed his law in the hearts of all men; he has written there the great and essential duty which he requires at our hands, and under every name and in every nation <HI>"they that fear God and work righteousness</HI> (so said the apostle) <HI>are accepted of him."</HI> So that, my friends, he makes no such distinctions as many of us poor, finite and weak creatures are apt to make; he does not confine acceptable worship to this nation, to this particular sect or opinion, nor to this particular Island: but I believe there are prayers ascend to him as sweet incense before his Holy Altar, both in the wilderness of America, and in the dark abodes of Africa, and in all the corners of the earth, wherever there are sincere and upright souls.</P>
<P>Well, my friends, this must certainly arise from some extensively and universally diffused principle in the souls of men, that with one common consent they agree in the great fundamentals of all Religion; this must be something more —even the infidel, if he considers, must allow it is some∣thing more—than human policy. Well, what is it then?
<PB N="43" REF="032807_0040_0FF528B16AD220B0"/>
What is it that prepareth the heart thus acceptably to offer unto GOD!—What is it that teacheth all men that HE ought to be worshipped? Why, it is nothing more, nor any thing less than the same eternal all-creating word, who fil∣leth all things, and is as intimately near to and independent of us as the very air we breathe; "for, (said the apostle) He is not far off any one of you; neither can he be; for in him we live, move, and have our being." Therefore it was that he exhorted them to <HI>"seek the Lord, if haply they might find him."</HI> Well, my friends, this is the great business of every Gospel minister; to labour to bring people here—to seek for themselves; to seek the Lord, if haply they may find HIM—Who is not far off any one of you; who is both with you, and in you, and without whose animating power thou couldst not exist one moment; neither could any man think a good thought or do a good action, except the Lord be with him. This is my faith. So that, my friends, it has taught me to get rid of all those narrow distinctions which many have been making, and which some are yet industriously endeavouring to build up between even the followers of the blessed Jesus; who ought always to be unit∣ed —always in harmony—always ONE, IN HIM. But, for my own part, having now for a number of years endea∣voured to seek the Lord impartially for myself, I have known him in this way; I have learned the Gospel in this way. For I have been clear in my opinion that all the in∣ventions and works of men, by their fallen wisdom, have only scattered the spiritual sheep in Jacob and divided them in Israel; and have split the christian church into so great a variety of names, and so great a variety of forms. For indeed we find many of them are rooted in prejudice one against another, Therefore the inquiry of this day seems to be, not so much, is it THE TRUTH that these men hold; but is he of <HI>my</HI> name?—or what <HI>name</HI> does he hold? this seems to be the foolish inquiry of many who can accept little or nothing except it comes from those who are esta∣blished in the same opinion, and within the bounds which
<PB N="44" REF="032807_0041_0FF5289E68616AE8"/>
<HI>they</HI> have built, and called after their own name among men. But, my friends, my belief is, that the Lord is aris∣ing in the earth to put an end to these divisions and distrac∣tions in his church; to bring down all those who have been exalted in their imaginations in supposing that they <HI>only</HI> were the people of GOD, in <HI>their form</HI> and in <HI>their manner,</HI> and reject all others.</P>
<P>O! how far off from that benevolence of soul which the christian religion inspires, appears faith of this kind!— And yet there are some remaining even in this enlightened day, who suppose and believe that without the pale of their particular church there can no man be saved.</P>
<P>But whence come these opinions? why I believe the Lord originally sowed good feed in his church, but while men have slept in carnal ease and security, an enemy has entered, scattered and divided them; and sown tares among them. Now, for my own part, it appears to me to be the great work of every diligent shepsherd of our Lord Jesus Christ to labour to bring all men back to the foundation— to the one true and overlasting fold. To remove all those opinions that have kept the world at variance so long—even in those that have loved God with sincerity of heart in their different professions among christians. O! how shy they have been of one another—how afraid of coming into the company of one another—how they have shunned one ano∣ther! Aye, my friends, can this be agreeable to the glori∣ous and dignified gospel of Jesus Christ that we profess? No: I trust no man will believe it can. Well then, the <HI>great</HI> inquiry ought to be, is there not one universal guide —one holy, divine, and unchangeable principle, by which we may all again be gathered into unity? Is there no such thing as TRUTH in the earth? I believe there is; and that all men may find it too, who are studiously desirous so to do —who prefer the knowledge of the truth to all things else— who are making every secondary consideration give way to their obtaining it; and when they have found it, to live in
<PB N="45" REF="032807_0042_0FF528B305E46088"/>
obedience to it. This is the sincere heart's enquiry among all the various names; that GOD will be pleased to teach them the way of TRUTH, and establish them in it. So that they shall all speak the fame language, that there may be no diversity of opinion in the ground and foundation of their belief. For this holy principle is <HI>one</HI>—it teaches plain, simple, and easy doctrine; comprised within a narrow compass, it does not confound and confuse the world with variety of mystical opinions, which are hard, or which if is impossible to comprehend. But the TRUTH upon which glory, immortality, and eternal life depend, is plain, free, and simple: <HI>"To know</HI> THEE <HI>the only true God, and</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>whom thou hast sent, is life eternal."</HI></P>
<P>Well, my friends, how shall we know this?—where shall we find it?—how shall we be assured that we are really in this knowledge—and in this faith? why, I think, if men—I speak now in much charity, for I do not boast of my own attainments, but what I feel and believe to be true from my own experience, and which appears to me to be consistent with the doctrines both of the Old and New Testament, that I am not ashamed to declare, though it were to thou∣sands and ten thousands; for I say from the very beginning there was an ETERNAL PRINCIPLE—there was an holy un∣flattering and unchangeable GUIDE placed in the souls of men, which if they had attended to, all men would have been led safe. "It is shewn to thee, (says the prophet) O man, what thou shouldst do, and what the Lord thy God requireth at thy hands; to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God."—It is shewn to thee what is good.—These are the forcible expressions—to "DO JUS∣TICE, to LOVE MARCY, to WALK HUMBLY WITH THE GOD."</P>
<P>And here I believe is the ground work and foundation of all religion. Can any man say it is not shewn to him, without the assistance of ministers, or any human learning, without the assistance of men learned in the schools, men of
<PB N="46" REF="032807_0043_0FF528D1DED9E360"/>
science, men of many languages, or men of profound edu∣cation —we can attain the knowledge of these saving truths, which are so essential for us to know, believe and practise? So that no man has any occasion, by any means whatever, to go inquire of his neighbour, or of his brother, concerning these things. So that, my friends, though indeed we have invited you here, and are glad of your company to sit down in this manner, we seek not any thing that is yours, but <HI>you</HI> only; to GOD, not to ourselves—not to this and that opinion; but that all men may come to the divine, eternal, and unchangeable <HI>principle</HI> in <HI>themselves,</HI> that would teach us in all things, the same that is spoken of in a variety of passages in Scripture; and yet in this day so much neglected; the same that our Saviour promised should be with his followers to the end of the world; even his own eternal Spirit, the Spirit of GOD and of CHRIST. This is the Ruler, the Director, the glorious and blessed Regulator of all things. Without it the Scriptures could never have been given. Because by it all the men of God were in∣spired to behold the light God had granted them concerning the things thereof; and by it all men are enlightened, more or less. For JESUS CHRIST is "the true LIGHT that en∣lighteneth," not only those that have read the history of his life, death, and sufferings; his glorious and unparal∣lelled Miracles and divine doctrines; but also those that have never heard of the name of CHRIST.</P>
<P>So enlarged is my opinion concerning the equality of God's ways. And the Scripture amply and fully justifies this opinion; for Christ is called, not only the <HI>light</HI> of his own followers who believed on him, but the <HI>true</HI> "light, that enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world;" be they of what name, of what distinction, or nation they may. And this <HI>light,</HI> (says the Evangelist John) is come into the world: But the reason why men continue under condemnation is this, (says he) <HI>"light</HI> is come into the world, but men love darkness rather than light, because
<PB N="47" REF="032807_0044_0FF52915A1B2EC30"/>
their deeds are evil:" they are not willing to bring their deeds to this glorious touch-stone, this test that would try all manner of actions—Christ IN you, the hope of everlast∣ing glory; in which the primitive believers were settled, and found here their rest.</P>
<P>Here, from the beginning, the Church of Christ was built; upon this Holy of Holies, and everlasting word of Christ and of God; speaking, directing, teaching, and leading them, wheresoever they should go. And if men had abode under this, it would have taught them all the same thing; it would have preserved those that have called themselves Christians, as well as all other men, in harmony and unity. It could have made neither rents nor divisions. No; no such thing: It would not have told thee one thing, and me another. By no means. But this is the language it would have proclaimed in thy heart and in mine, that "The work of Righteousness is peace, and the effect thereof is quietness and assurance for ever." Now is not this written upon every man's conscience? Yes, I am per∣suaded it is. And I have heard the wild inhabitants of America declare this was <HI>the truth;</HI> and they found it inscrib∣ed upon their hearts (according to their own expressions) by the finger of God's spirit himself, namely, that the work of Righteousness is peace, and the way to be happy in this present life, and to be eternally happy in the world to come, is, to obey his voice; to work Righteousness; to be upright in heart; to do those things which, by his law written in them, he had made known to them they ought to do: and this divine principle I want more to come unto. But men have been too long bewildered in following one another in darkness and confusion: this is my faith, and I believe no man among us can say but this is the case.</P>
<P>We must (if ever we are brought back) come to the foundation and corner-stone whereon the first Church was built. We must go to Christ; we must leave our depend∣ance upon man, and come to the <HI>Fountain.</HI> For the same
<PB N="48" REF="032807_0045_0FF52881424705E8"/>
declaration may indeed be put to thee, and the expression will hold good with respect to far too many in this day, that was expressed concerning the Jews,—"My people have committed two great evils, they have forsaken me the foun∣tain of living waters, and they have hewn out to themselves broken cisterns that can hold no water." Well, my friends, I am assured that many of you assent to this, that of all the systems and inventions of men, be they ever so specious, or maintained with ever so much pomp or elo∣quence, these do not nor cannot bring one soul to Christ. It must be something beyond all the powers of men; it must be by his own eternal power, if ever we are brought to experience the glorious and blessed rest prepared for those that love him. For no man can come to the Father but by Christ; and "no man (said he) can come to me except my Father draw him." If Noah, Job, and Daniel were here, they could save neither son nor daughter's life; they could only, through God's grace, and attention to his in∣speaking word, be instrumental to save their own souls.</P>
<P>For no man can either do the work for another, or by any means direct him after safety, but this holy, internal, unchangeable guide alone. Are there any persons present who say, "this is strange doctrine?" Well, my friends, if it is strange doctrine, it has this to recommend it at least, that it is not <HI>new;</HI> it is as old as the Apostles days, and as old as the Prophets days, in former dispensations. But I be∣lieve life and immortality were in a more marvellous manner brought to light by the revelation of God, through Jesus Christ. Therefore we need go no further back than the New Testament; for by the doctrine therein contained, we hope and believe we are to be saved. Is not this the case? Yes, I believe it is. Well then, my friends, let us see whether we live up to this doctrine. Let us see whether we really are what the primitive churches were. Let us find whether our belief is rightly founded, or whether we depend merely upon hear-say. 'Tis not upon the
<PB N="49" REF="032807_0046_0FF5287FA8049930"/>
<HI>hear-say</HI> opinions of men; 'tis not from the works of the learned, nor from the speeches of eloquence, but upon something that we feel within. For I believe this must fi∣nally be the case, if ever we are prepared to join the host of heaven, the redeemed and saved of God. We must know the truth in ourselves. Christ is the way, the truth, and the life; and he told us this before he left the world. He told us plainly that he that is with you shall be in you. Is there any doctrine more clear than this. "He that is with you shall be in you: and lo I am with you to the end of the world. And if I go away, I will pray the Father, and he shall send another comforter:" that is, in another form, He shall send the Spirit of Truth, who shall lead and guide you into all truth. Well, here is a safe direction, and an unchangeable directory too. He shall send you another comforter, even the spirit of truth; who shall lead and guide you into all truth; who shall take from me, and shew it to you, and shall bring all things to your remembrance. Can there be any plainer doctrine than this? I believe many of you, my friends, assent to the truth of this, and that this is the way in which we ought to inquire after the Truth as it is in Jesus; we ought to come to Him himself: we ought to retire to that holy uniting Word which we have received: (for as said the Apostle) ye have no need that any man teach you. Why then are there so many teachers in the world; and maintained at so vast an expense? Why do so many take so much pains to qualify themselves to be teachers of the flock of Christ, if this is really the case? And I trust, my friends, you will be candid enough to say, Certainly it is. You have no need that any man teach you, but as this same uniting Word teaches you, which is truth. I trust I am surrounded with many tender hearts, and many charitable Christians, who have been seeking the truth for many years; why then, my friends, you must come to this divine teacher before ever you can be favoured with the knowledge of the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="032807_0047_0FF528E2E686C330"/>I verily believe no man will ever come to the knowledge of the truth in any other way. Thou may'st explore volumes after volumes, and spend much time in reading of many pi∣ous books, and experiences of many favourite men of God. I do not despise inferior helps. The Scriptures are ex∣cellent: they are much more so, and worthier to be held in greater estimation than all the books in the world. But the Scriptures point only to that holy all-powerful Word which indeed gave all the Scripture. The whole tenor of the Gospel doctrine is to bring men there—to settle them upon that foundation; where they may build with safety— to the teachings of the holy and blessed spirit of God within them. I know this is a doctrine too much exploded. How unjust! how derogatory to the goodness and mercy of God, to send thousands and millions of thousands into this world, with powers and faculties to conceive that there is immor∣tality, and to believe that there are glorious rewards in the world to come, if he had left us no other guide to go by.</P>
<P>Now some will say, "We have the Scriptures to go by." Do we not see enough of this? Truly the Scriptures do direct us to this glorious principle within us, yet how do men turn them to every purpose! one learned man starts up in one quarter of the nation, and he says, "here is a por∣tion of Scripture, and I assure you it means so and so;"— and another declares with equal learning, with a great deal of study, and with abundance of eloquence, "my friends, it is so and so, this way you must believe:" and there is one even gone over to the country of my nativity, who with the New Testament in his hands, is laying the axe by his arguments as much as is in his power to the very root of the Christian Religion. This is my faith, that he is destroying the foundation whereon it is built, and yet pretending to bring his doctrine from the Scripture. But what will not sophistry do?—What has it not done?—O! the evils it has produced in the world. But I trust neither this man, leaned and wise as he may be in the world's esti∣mation,
<PB N="51" REF="032807_0048_0FF5292C9621C580"/>
nor any other, will ever be able to sap that foun∣dation which God has laid in Sion, nor to rob you or my own soul of that glorious hope and blessed consolation in the redemption and mediation of our dear Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,—God forbid it should: and I trust it will not. —The Lord will by his own light and power dispel every cloud and darkness that shall arise to cast up a mist before the eyes of the professors of Christianity.</P>
<P>But to return. I want you, my friends, it is my most earnest labour wheresoever it may please God to take me, throughout his vineyard, to get people if possible to build upon a foundation that those various opinions of men will not be able to shake. I know that there is a foundation where all those various and contradictory opini∣ons of men may butt against the honest and sincere-hearted pilgrim's dwelling, and not be able to shake it. This I am persuaded of. Verily there is a Rest for the people of God; there is something whereon we may build safe; that is, in Christ: "CHRIST IN YOU the hope of glory." O! that you may seek to him! God is no respecter of persons: He will teach all men himself; he will manifest his mercy equally to all men: he rejects none: he makes none of the distinctions of high and low, rich and poor, that we poor weak beings do. No: he is equal in his ways and just in all his doings: and those that come to him he will in no wise cast out. For "there is no difference (says the Apostle) between the Jew and Greek; for one God over all, is rich unto all that come unto him;" rich to all that seek him; and so he remains to be.</P>
<P>O my friends, were you to adhere to these plain and sim∣ple truths, it would prevent a great deal of confusion in the world; it would bring about a different face and ap∣pearance among the professors of christianity, from what we now behold in Europe; it would put an end to all dis∣sensions; it would put an end to all envying one another; to all false, to all evil speaking, and even evil thinking
<PB N="52" REF="032807_0049_0FF528EFD20071B8"/>
one of another. This I am confident of, if it was adhered to. For Christ and his glorious dispensation, is not a dis∣pensation of strife and dispute: for when he came, there was even uttered by the Songs of Angels, <HI>"Peace on Earth, and Good-will to Men."</HI> And he declared that, "By this should all men know that ye are my disciples—if ye love one another." And so we may as reasonably conclude, that by this shall all men know that ye are not Christ's dis∣ciples, ye if hate, devour, and destroy one another. It is as clear to me as the Sun that shines in the firmament. He was the Prince of Peace; of whose Government the Prophet Isaiah declares there never should be an end. O my fellow Christians, let us with all our souls draw nigh unto, and seek for his holy power to influence our hearts; that he may bring us into the bond of christian charity, and of holy and blessed union one with another; that He may destroy all that seeks to blow up nations and kingdoms into confusion—and that seeks to bring distress upon individuals, nations and countries! Do not we behold the ravages of WAR? what has it done even in this nation, where the sound of WAR has only been heard, how many weeping widows? how many tender parents has it lately deprived of their support. It never would have been so, I am persuaded, if the professors of christianity had kept to their first principle. No man can believe it, I think, with the Bible in his hand: which forbids in our Lord's express words our saying in this glorious day, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." Yet alas! Is it not the language too much used among us?—"Thou hast injured me and therefore I will injure thee:—thou hast spoken evil of me and I will speak evil also of thee." But ought it to be so? —Ought we not rather to suffer injuries, as the primitive believers did, without murmuring; without complaining? They received them all with meekness, as their holy and blessed Redeemer did before them; who even when he was about to quit the body by the hands of cruel men, did not he set us a glorious example, even towards his last moments, "Father, forgive them, says he, for they know not what
<PB N="53" REF="032807_0050_0FF529483822AAA0"/>
they do!" He that had power to call legions of angels at his command, meekly in this manner addressed his father."</P>
<P>"Well: (but some may say) Is it really possible to come into this spirit of forgiving of injuries—to bear in∣sults, without even returning and retorting again?" Why yes: I verily believe the Gospel Spirit would lead us into all this. "Why then, (some may say) Wouldst thou have men to be cowards?" No, by no means. Cowards where they ought to be cowards, to be sure—afraid to do evil; but magnanimous heroes, under the service and in the service of the glorious King, the Lord Jesus Christ! Because the LAMB and his followers will finally obtain the victory. O then, my friends, let us with one accord add to our faith, works. It is a glorious and blessed faith: But if thou add not to thy faith, works, is there a probability that thou wilt reap the glorious reward? O what is it that our blessed Lord pronounced to those that distinguished themselves with works of mercy, with works of benevo∣lence, and works of peace, who lived in the peace of his divine and holy religion, which he had given them to ob∣serve, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the king∣dom prepared for you before the foundation of the world. I was sick, and in prison, and ye visited me. I was hun∣gry, and ye fed me. I was naked, and ye clothed me. I was a stranger, and ye took me in, to comfort me. Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world."</P>
<P>Now it is this kingdom that I want you, my friends, all to inherit. To be so prepared against the awful summons, which is approaching to us all, that we may look forward without dismay; that we may be favoured with that hope, which will be as an anchor to the soul, both sure and stead∣fast, for whatever we may have promised to ourselves, in a moment that thou knowest not, "the Son of man cometh;" thy days here may be few; <HI>"dust thou art, and to dust thou shalt return!"</HI></P>
<Q><L>Earth's highest station ends in, "here he lies:"</L>
<L>And, "dust to dust" concludes her noblest song.</L></Q>

<HEAD>The Second Discourse of W. Savery.</HEAD>
<P>MY Religion teaches me this—and it is the grand ruling and fundamental point upon which I desire to rest my salvation: that is, to endeavour to have <HI>"a con∣science void of offence, both towards God and Man."</HI></P>
<P>I desire not to offend any of my fellow-travellers in the way to the kingdom; far be it from me. I know that there is great indulgence necessary one towards another. We have been variously educated, we have had various pre∣judices in our minds, and nothing but the divine illumina∣ting power can make them subside so as we might have charity one towards another. I believe there are some of the Lord's true Church in every name and among every nation; and that there are not only these who are professing the same faith with me, and who worship God in silence as I do, but also in other professions there are those who in sincerity of soul offer up their prayers to God. This I de∣sire to believe wherever I may be.</P>
<P>I am here in this Island at present: but am going to the continent of Europe. I seek not my own, the Lord know∣eth; nor the applause of men, nor any thing that they can give; but a quiet and peaceful conscience: and that I may be made in some small degree instrumental to induce some to enter into that holy bond of everlasting union and har∣mony which shall go with us beyond the grave. This is the great and most important work that I have now to do among you—aye, it is all—and for which I have left my peaceful home, and my endeared connections—that so if possible I might be an instrument of uniting my fellow pro∣fessors. O! then, that we may look upon one another with that charity which ever ought to distinguish all the followers of Christ: for I believe there may be followers of HIM in many forms that I have not particularly heard of at present. But through the divine mercy I believe I have found him who was typified by all the types and figures
<PB N="55" REF="032807_0052_0FF52946A3D86440"/>
that went before HIM, Jesus Christ, the Son and Sent of God: and that all men may find him to their comfort here, their peace, their settlement of mind, and their ever∣lasting rejoicing in the world to come.</P>
<P>Seek him then my friends impartially: enter into your closets: do as the noble Bereans did, when they heard the doctrine which the servant of Jesus Christ delivered to them, they searched the Scriptures diligently to see whether these things were so; and the apostle said "these were more noble than those of Thessalonica, because when they heard the truths of the Gospel they searched diligently;" they did not let them pass by unnoticed, as it were in at one ear and out of the other, but searched diligently to see whether these things were so.</P>
<P>I believe that if this were the case with some that are now present, they would indeed be made wiser than some of their teachers: though I believe I have fellow-labourers in the gospel of Jesus Christ, among the various professors, under every christian name, yet I believe, and with all the charity I can attain, that there are far too many who have entered into Christ's church with sinister views; that are making it a living and a competency for support in this life, more than preaching the Gospel for Jesus Christ's sake. Yet I say, I believe I have some faithful brethren in the ministry, who labour with all their powers to exalt the glory of God upon the earth; and to bring people into that condition whereon they may lay hold of the kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Therefore, my friends, let no man judge me as a sectarian. I wish your everlasting happiness: I wish all our increase in that wisdom which is from above; that so as we advance in years and the time draws nigh wherein we must lay down this mortal and perishing body, we may through the mercy of God be gathered to himself, and through his love which is unspeakable, be with the Saints and Angels, glorifying and praising his Name, for ever and ever, world without end.</P>
