<P>WHEN the Offspring of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> felt the stroke of Death from the <HI>Men of Gath,</HI> in an Unsea∣sonable and Unsuccessful Sal∣ley upon the <HI>Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes</HI> we read; 1 Chron VII 21. <HI>The Father Mourned many days, and his Brethren came to Comfort him.</HI> What has befallen You in the Death of a Beloved SON, slain by the Men, whom a Righteous GOD has Employ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the Dispensations of His <HI>Wine-Press,</HI> threat∣ens to leave You <HI>Mourning many Days.</HI> Yea, you seem disposed, not altogether unlike the Patriarch [the Father of <HI>Ephraim</HI>] who, upon the Apprehension of an <HI>Evil Beast</HI> having <HI>Devoured</HI> his Beloved <HI>Son, refused

to be Comforted,</HI> and said, <HI>I will go down into the Grave unto my Son, Mourning:</HI> And you Apprehend nothing, but having Your <HI>Gray-hairs brought down with Sorrow to the Grave.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG the <HI>Brethren</HI> that come to <HI>Com∣fort</HI> You, here is One who is Your <HI>Bro∣ther in Adversity;</HI> and who just before You, had the Praemature Death of <HI>His</HI> Eldest Son, to add unto the Embitterments of his Pil∣grimage. And he comes to <HI>Comfort you, in your Trouble by the Comfort, wherewith</HI> he has himself been <HI>Comforted of GOD;</HI> and invite You to join with him, in the <HI>Songs,</HI> which he has and Sings, <HI>In the House of his Pil∣grimage.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR <HI>Dear Son</HI> had a GRAND-FATHER, who was the <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Safety</HI> of his Coun∣try; and the General of all the Forces wherewith our United Colonies performed the most Martial Exploit that ever was done in our Land.

<P>'TIS too soon, and this is not a place for me to say any thing of his FATHER, except what we find said on <HI>Joseph</HI> of <HI>Arimath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> He has been, <HI>An Honourable Counsellour.</HI></P>
<P>UNTO such an <HI>Honourable Descent,</HI> there being added the <HI>Liberal Education</HI> which his FATHER bestow'd upon him, to fit him for doing somewhat considerable in the World, what <HI>Expectations</HI> might have been reason∣ably raised of his doing something that should be worthy the Offspring of such Meritorious Ancestors!</P>
<P>BUT our Sovereign GOD has Determined it, That all shall be comprised in this one Action; <HI>To lay down his Life in the Service of his Country:</HI> The <HI>Spark</HI> that was Mounting <HI>Upwards,</HI> and we knew not what Lustre he might anon arrive unto, must only give this <HI>Coup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d' Eclat,</HI> and fall down into the common Heap of <HI>Ashes:</HI> And instead of proceeding <HI>Master of Arts,</HI> as if he had Lived a Few Weeks more he would have done, receive the <HI>Laurel</HI> of, One who <HI>Died Fighting the Bat∣tels of the Lord.</HI></P>

THIS Alone is enough to bespeak a Grate∣ful <HI>Commemoration</HI> of him; which is accord∣ingly now endeavoured.

<P>THAT the <HI>Consolations of GOD</HI> may <HI>not be small</HI> unto You, is the <HI>Hearts Desire and Prayer,</HI> of</P>

THE People under his Conduct Expected <HI>Waters,</HI> upon their first entrance into the <HI>Arabian</HI> Wilderness thro' which they were to pass unto the <HI>Promised Land.</HI> But the <HI>Waters</HI> which they found, prov'd Bitter ones: Even such as Procured hereupon the Name of <HI>Ma∣rah,</HI> to be given them.

Whatever grievous Things they meet withal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a <HI>Moses</HI> must be Barbarously, Unreasonably, Unaccountably <HI>Murmured</HI> at.

with us. The Affairs of that <HI>peculiar People,</HI> which GOD in the days of old remarkably distinguished from the rest of the World, had in them notable <HI>Figures</HI> of the <HI>My<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eries,</HI> which the People of GOD after the coming of our SAVIOUR were to be more fully ac∣quainted withal. The <HI>Tree</HI> that <HI>sweetened</HI> the Waters of <HI>Marah,</HI> was a <HI>Type</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> something to be found in the <HI>Gospel of our Salvation,</HI> which will wonderfully <HI>sweeten</HI> all the <HI>bitter</HI> Things that we meet withal. From that famous <HI>Tree</HI> I will gather a DOCTRINE, which, I hope, you will give a Comfortable Attention to. Tis this;</P>
<Q>WHATEVER we find Bitter to us in our Travel thro' the Wilderness of this World; there is a TREE, the Application whereof will take away all the Bitterness.</Q>
<P>THE first Thing which we have now to be sensible of, is a Thing which we all cannot but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sensible of. It may be said, <HI>Behold, All we ourselves have seen it.</HI> It is this▪ That in our <HI>Travel</HI> thro' this World, unto a Better World, there are <HI>bitter Waters</HI> to be met withal. We are <HI>Travellers</HI> thro a <HI>Wilderness,</HI> towards a <HI>Bet∣ter Country, that is, an Heavenly.</HI> Certainly we meet with Occurrences enough, to convince us, That while we are in <HI>this present Evil World,</HI> we
<PB N="4" REF="002668_0009_0FE5F1A2417A2898"/>
are but in a <HI>Wilderness.</HI> Our <HI>Wants,</HI> our <HI>Fears,</HI> our loss about our <HI>Way,</HI> &amp; Thousands of Diffi∣culties which in our condition we meet withal, are the too livel Characters of a <HI>Wilderness.</HI> Yea, to this World, we may too aptly apply the Characters of the <HI>Arabian Wilderness</HI> where the <HI>Israelites</HI> laid their Carcases; <HI>A land of pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts and of droughts and of fiery Flying Serpents.</HI> In this our <HI>Wilderness,</HI> we have a <HI>Thirst</HI> for many good Things. Our <HI>Thirsty</HI> Souls have their Appetites to be satisfied. But, alas, They are <HI>Bitter Waters,</HI> which we meet withal: Such <HI>Disappointments</HI> do our <HI>Thirsty Souls,</HI> relying upon <HI>Creatures,</HI> meet withal. In the old Records of the Church, we find a Godly Woman, among the Travel∣lers thro' the Wilderness of this World; who said, Ruth I. 20. <HI>Call me, Marah; Because the Almighty has greatly caused bitterness unto me.</HI> Truly, The <HI>bitter Waters</HI> of <HI>Marah,</HI> are so dispensed unto them who Travel thro' the Wilderness, that the Travellers themselves claim the Name of <HI>Marah</HI> too. Our <HI>Wilder∣ness</HI> will anon Terminate in a <HI>Pleasant Land.</HI> The <HI>Promis'd Land</HI> will be found a <HI>pleasant Land;</HI> verily, in that Land, there will be found <HI>Fulness of Joy,</HI> and <HI>Pleasures forever∣more.</HI> The <HI>bitter Waters</HI> of the <HI>Wilderness</HI> are most <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sely</HI> as well as <HI>Justly</HI> ordered for us; To prepare us for the <HI>Land flowing

with milk and honey.</HI> But, if we will be In∣quisitive, What is the True <HI>Spring</HI> of our <HI>bitter Waters?</HI> or, What lies at the <HI>Bottom</HI> of our Condition, to <HI>Embitter</HI> it. I remember, that in the Visions of the <HI>Apocalypse,</HI> we read, Rev. VIII 10. <HI>A great star<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se upon the foun∣tains of Waters; and the name of the star is cal∣led, Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter.</HI> The <HI>bitter Servitude</HI> wherein to many Provinces of the Roman Empire were brought, when the <HI>Goths</HI> made their Descent from the North upon it, may be thus pointed out unto us. Alluding unto this, my Observation shall be, That <HI>Sin, Sin,</HI> shall be considered as the <HI>Star</HI> that falls upon the <HI>Fountains</HI> of our <HI>Waters:</HI> This, as a <HI>Comet</HI> bears down upon us, and its Influences reach to the <HI>bottom</HI> of our Condi∣tion in the World. O Thou <HI>Star</HI> to be for∣ever called <HI>Wormwood▪</HI> It is thou that hast infused a bitterness into our whole Condition, and made our <HI>Waters</HI> as <HI>bitter as Wormwood.</HI> Yea, we <HI>Dy,</HI> we <HI>Dy</HI> of the <HI>Waters,</HI> because they are made so very <HI>bitter.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, What are the <HI>Bitter Waters</HI> of the <HI>Wilderness?</HI></P>
<P>First, IN <HI>Repentance</HI> there are <HI>Bitter Wa∣ters</HI> which we must be brought unto. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Repentance to Salvation▪</HI> without
<PB N="6" REF="002668_0011_0FE5F52ECD287C08"/>
<HI>Repentance</HI> there is no coming to <HI>Salvation.</HI> We cannot come to the Enjoyment of GOD, in the <HI>sinless Mansions,</HI> if we are not sorry for our Departure from GOD, and if we don't Bewail and Abhor and Forsake the <HI>sin</HI> which disqualifies us for those <HI>Holy Mansions.</HI> Now there is a <HI>bitterness</HI> of Soul, in that <HI>Contrition</HI> for Sin, which is in all true <HI>Repentance.</HI> Of true <HI>Penitents,</HI> there is this Account given; Zech. XII. 10. <HI>They shall be in bitterness.</HI> In Sin we venture upon <HI>Stolen Waters;</HI> and these at first are <HI>sweet</HI> unto us. But in <HI>Re∣pentance,</HI> they must be changed into <HI>bitter Waters.</HI> The <HI>sweetest Pleasures</HI> of Sin, must become very <HI>bitter,</HI> in the <HI>Reflections</HI> that <HI>Re∣pentance</HI> is to make upon them. After we have <HI>Drunk in Iniquity like water,</HI> it will by <HI>Repentance</HI> rise in our Stomach, and become then as <HI>bitter as Gall</HI> unto us. One who had wallow'd in much <HI>Unchastity,</HI> was brought by <HI>Repentance</HI> to say, <HI>I fin'd it more bitter than Death unto me!</HI> Of one come unto <HI>Repentance</HI> we read, Mat. XXVI. 75. <HI>He wept bitterly.</HI> The <HI>Tears</HI> of <HI>Repentance</HI> are <HI>bitter Waters.</HI> With a <HI>Repenting</HI> Soul, we are to look back and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, <HI>I have sinned, and I have done very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> See, <HI>I have sinned, and I have denied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD that is above!</HI> See, <HI>I have sinned, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> my own soul!</HI> Tis with an Un∣speakable <HI>bitterness</HI> that we are to look back
<PB N="7" REF="002668_0012_0FE5F1AA37826F18"/>
upon it. Sinner, <HI>Thy Wickedness, it is bitter; So it must be, when it reaches to thy Heart, in thy Resentments of it.</HI> Alas, Thou art in the <HI>Gall of bitterness,</HI> until <HI>Repentance</HI> render thy Sins more <HI>bitter</HI> than any <HI>Gall</HI> unto thee.</P>
<P>Secondly, IN <HI>Affliction,</HI> there are <HI>bitter Waters,</HI> which we shall be brought unto. There will be <HI>Need</HI> of it, that we should be <HI>in heaviness;</HI> and we shall be so. <HI>Affliction</HI> will cause us to be so. But we are in <HI>bitterness</HI> when we are so. An Handmaid of the Lord being in much <HI>Affliction,</HI> we read, 2 Sam. I 10. <HI>She was in bitterness of Soul. Affliction</HI> is Unavoidable. Every thing that Sojourns upon the Earth, which has <HI>Thorns</HI> every where growing in it, is <HI>Afflicted</HI> with them. <HI>O Man born of a Woman,</HI> Dream not that thy <HI>few Days</HI> will be <HI>free</HI> from <HI>Trouble;</HI> No, they will be full of them. But <HI>Affliction</HI> will Produce those Lamentations, Lam III <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5 <HI>He hath filled me with bitterness.</HI> Of a certain time we read, <HI>He saw the Affliction of Israel that it was very bitter.</HI> But indeed, what <HI>Af∣fliction</HI> is there, of which we say not, <HI>It is bitter!</HI> The <HI>Weeping</HI> Eyes of People in <HI>Afflicti∣on,</HI> yield streams of <HI>bitter Waters.</HI> The Eyes that are a Fountain of Tears, have a <HI>bitter Liquor</HI> flowing there. It is the Language of the Prophet, <HI>They shall weep with bitterness of
<PB N="8" REF="002668_0013_0FE5F52FEF967308"/>
Heart.</HI> The Afflicted Prophet of GOD said, <HI>I will weep bitterly.</HI> The <HI>briny Liquor</HI> distil∣led from the Eyes by <HI>Affliction</HI> is a <HI>bitter Li∣quor</HI> Affliction causes one to say, <HI>I will com∣plain in the bitterness of my Soul. Affliction</HI> causes another to say, <HI>I shall go softly all my Life in the bitterness of my Soul.</HI> O Thou Passenger thro' the valley of <HI>Baca;</HI> Many sad things will befal thee here, whereupon thou shalt say, Lord, <HI>Thou writest bitter things against me.</HI> They to whom GOD gives Tears to Drink in a great measure, these can tell of <HI>bitter Waters.</HI></P>
<P>BUT can we come at nothing to <HI>sweet∣en</HI> the <HI>bitter Waters?</HI> Yes, there is a Second Thing to be now Remarkable with us. We are to be advised of a <HI>Tree,</HI> by the Applica∣tion whereof, the <HI>bitter waters</HI> of our <HI>Wil∣derness,</HI> will be wonderfully <HI>sweetened</HI> unto us. There is a <HI>Tree,</HI> on which let us employ our <HI>Thoughts,</HI> and with <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> let us make our Flight unto it, and let us in this way apply it unto the purposes for which GOD has provided it: The <HI>bitter waters</HI> of <HI>Marah,</HI> will now be wonderfully Dulcified, and lose all their <HI>bitterness.</HI> There is a <HI>Tree</HI> whereof I may say unto you, <HI>Tis a Tree w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> fair branches, and with a shadowing shrowd, and of an high stature.</HI> The <HI>heighth of this Tree</HI> is <HI>Exalted above all the Trees of the Field;</HI> Nor is <HI>any Tree in the Garden of GOD like unto
<PB N="9" REF="002668_0014_0FE5F531180E89F0"/>
Him, for his Beauty.</HI> I may also tell you for your Satisfaction, Tis a Tree which you will be all welcome to: <HI>A Tree planted in the Mountain of the Heighth of Israel; and under it shall dwell all Fowle of every wing.</HI> Yea, of this <HI>Tree,</HI> I may for a further Satisfaction tell you, you need not go, or send unto a <HI>Foreign Country</HI> for it. The <HI>Tree</HI> is <HI>Nigh unto you.</HI> You may easily come at it, and as often as you please. It stands just before you.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY, you are willing to know, what this <HI>Tree</HI> should be; what the Blessed <HI>Sweetener</HI> of all our <HI>bitter waters.</HI> And I make no Question, but that in your own Minds, you already apprehend, What, and Where and Who the <HI>Tree</HI> is, that I shall point you to. Truly, a CHRIST, a CHRIST, is what I must point you to. You did ex∣pect that I would point you thither. A Glorious CHRIST, is the <HI>Tree. Other Tree for the sweetening</HI> of our <HI>bitter waters, can no man</HI> tell of. The <HI>Tree</HI> that is to take out the <HI>bitterness</HI> from the Waters of <HI>Marah</HI> must be the <HI>Tree of Life;</HI> It can be no other than the <HI>Tree</HI> whereof we read, Rev. XXII. 2. <HI>The Tree of Life, which yields its Fruit every Month, and the leaves of the Tree are for the Healing of the Nations.</HI> The Beloved Man in the Visions of GOD, saw close by this <HI>Tree of Life, A pure
<PB N="10" REF="002668_0015_0FE5F5327902A290"/>
River of Water of Life proceeding out of the Throne of GOD, and of the Lamb.</HI> You may be sure, there was no <HI>bitterness</HI> in this <HI>water of Life.</HI> There is nothing but <HI>sweet water</HI> in this <HI>River of GOD.</HI> If the <HI>Tree of Life</HI> be near it, it must be so. But O Believer, can any thing but a CHRIST be the <HI>Tree of Life</HI> unto thee? There, There is the <HI>Tree!</HI> O Fly unto it, for the <HI>Cure</HI> of all the <HI>bitterness,</HI> which the <HI>Forbidden Tree</HI> has brought unto thee. But Behold How the <HI>Wonders</HI> grow upon us! Our SAVIOUR does then most of all prove the <HI>Tree of Life</HI> unto us, when we behold Him on the <HI>Tree of Death,</HI> which He was <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>il'd</HI> unto. Tis a <HI>Crucified CHRIST</HI> that is the <HI>Tree of Life. I am determined to know</HI> and Preach <HI>nothing so much as this among you!</HI> The <HI>Cross</HI> of our SAVIOUR, that <HI>Cursed,</HI> Ragged, Wretched sort of a <HI>Tree;</HI> This is the <HI>Tree,</HI> which above all things, has the most Sovereign Vertue, to <HI>sweeten</HI> our <HI>bitter waters.</HI> The <HI>Cross</HI> on which, when our SAVIOUR cried out, <HI>I Thirst,</HI> they gave Him a <HI>Bitter Potion;</HI> They gave Him <HI>Vinegar</HI> dashed with <HI>Gall,</HI> to Drink; This will take out the <HI>Gall</HI> of every <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>up</HI> in the <HI>Thing appointed</HI> for us. By casting the <HI>Cross</HI> of our SAVIOUR into the <HI>Waters</HI> of <HI>Marah,</HI> Which is done by Meditations on a <HI>Crucified CHRIST,</HI> un∣der all <HI>Embitterments,</HI> they will be <HI>Sweetened</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="002668_0016_0FE5F536E75B7850"/>
unto Admiration. Let us a little enter into this <HI>Mystery of Godliness.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> THE <HI>Bitter Waters</HI> of <HI>Repentance</HI> will be wonderfully <HI>Sweetened,</HI> when a CHRIST is well-applied unto us. Declare, O Soul in the <HI>bitter</HI> Anguish of <HI>Repentance;</HI> Will not the Hope and Joy of a <HI>Pardon</HI> mightily <HI>sweet∣en</HI> these <HI>bitter Waters?</HI> Yes The sense of a GOD Reconciled, will be so <HI>sweet</HI> a Thing, that it will even <HI>sweeten</HI> all the <HI>bitter Things</HI> that we can from any Quarter meet withal. Now, Repair to thy SAVIOUR, and Rely on the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> which he has offered up unto GOD, for the Expiation of the <HI>Sins</HI> which thou d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st <HI>Remember</HI> as the <HI>Wormwood and the Gall,</HI> thy Soul <HI>has them in Remembrance</HI> and is <HI>Humbled in thee.</HI> The <HI>Blood</HI> shed by thy SA∣VIOUR, in the Sufferings which He finished on the <HI>Cross,</HI> This <HI>Blood Cleanses from all sin.</HI> Plead this <HI>Blood;</HI> Plead it with Agony; Plead it with Dependence; Plead it with a most high Value for it, and a desire to have it Operate unto all the Sacred Intentions of it. There will hereupon come unto thee that Message from GOD; 2 Sam.

AND now, What is become of the <HI>Bitter Waters?</HI> They are strangely <HI>Sweetened.</HI> The Sweet <HI>Hope</HI> &amp; <HI>Joy</HI> of the <HI>Salvation of GOD;</HI> This gives to the Soul, the <HI>Consolations</HI> that are <HI>not small.</HI> The Soul cannot but be <HI>of good Cheer,</HI> when that Voice comes from GOD un∣to it, <HI>Child, Thy Sins are Forgiven thee!</HI> The <HI>bitter Herbs</HI> of the <HI>Passover,</HI> did they not lose their <HI>bitterness</HI> by the <HI>Paschal Lamb,</HI> which they were annex'd unto! <HI>Repentance</HI> is a Diet of <HI>bitter Herbs;</HI> But there is this to <HI>sweeten</HI> it; CHRIST <HI>our Passover has been Sacrificed for us.</HI> Yea, more than This. A Soul thus <HI>Justified,</HI> will now be so <HI>Sanctified,</HI> that the very Exercise of <HI>Repentance</HI> itself, shall be beyond all expression <HI>sweet</HI> unto it. The <HI>Past</HI> of the Renewed Soul will be so al∣tered, that it will find a Thousand times more <HI>sweetness</HI> in the <HI>Repenting</HI> of Sin, than ever it found in the <HI>Committing</HI> of Sin. Of <HI>Religion</HI> they that have tried it, bear this Testimony, <HI>All the ways of Wisdom are pleasant ways. Re∣pentance</HI> is the most <HI>bitter</HI> Thing in <HI>Religion.</HI> But it is now found, that there is more <HI>Plea∣sure</HI> in <HI>Mourning</HI> for Sin, than there is in <HI>Acting</HI> of it. Tis a <HI>sweeter</HI> Thing by far, to <HI>Mortify</HI> a Lust, than it can be to <HI>Gratify</HI> it. <HI>Regeneration</HI> will bring such a change upon the <HI>woful Relish</HI> which we have had, when we have put <HI>sweet for bitter, and bitter for

sweet.</HI> The <HI>bitter Austerities</HI> of <HI>Repen∣tance,</HI> will become the <HI>sweetest</HI> Things in the World unto us.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> THE <HI>Bitter Waters</HI> of <HI>Affliction</HI> will be wonderfully <HI>Sweetened,</HI> when a CHRIST is well-applied unto us. <HI>O Thou Afflicted and not Comforted,</HI> Converse much with a CHRIST, under thy <HI>Affliction,</HI> and thou wilt soon be <HI>Comforted.</HI> Thy <HI>Affliction</HI> comes to drive thee unto thy SAVIOUR. The <HI>Storms</HI> that beat upon thee, are to drive thee unto this <HI>Tree</HI> of GOD; The <HI>Tree</HI> whereof thou mayst <HI>sit under the shadow with Delight,</HI> and the <HI>Fruit</HI> be <HI>sweet</HI> unto thy <HI>tast.</HI> Especi∣ally, a CHRIST as <HI>Crucified,</HI> is now to be con∣versed withal. Thy <HI>Affliction</HI> is the <HI>Cross</HI> which thy SAVIOUR has assign'd unto thee. Go with it unto the <HI>Cross</HI> which thy SAVIOUR has endured for thee. Throw as much as thou canst of this <HI>Tree</HI> into thy <HI>bitter Waters.</HI> 'Twill so <HI>sweeten</HI> them, that all the <HI>bitterness</HI> thereof shall be to thee, but <HI>as Waters that pass away.</HI> One very deeply concerned with <HI>bitter Waters,</HI> being able to say, <HI>I have poured out my Soul unto the Lord;</HI> It is Reported, <HI>She was no more sad.</HI> Going to the Lord with the <HI>Out-pourings of thy Soul,</HI> thou wilt put that in∣to the <HI>bitter Waters,</HI> by the means whereof, thou mayest be <HI>no more sad.</HI> Thou mayst now
<PB N="14" REF="002668_0019_0FE5F53AEB1B1478"/>
say, <HI>Call me not</HI> Marah, <HI>but call me</HI> Naomi <HI>for I am very pleasantly accommodated.</HI> It was an Uncomfortable Moan, Lam. I. 16. <HI>I weep, mine Eye, mine Eye runneth down with water.</HI> And whence these <HI>bitter Waters! Because the Comforter that should relieve my Soul is far from me.</HI> But now, if in thy Adversity, thou dost Converse much with a CHRIST, the <HI>Com∣forter that will relieve thy Soul,</HI> is <HI>nigh to thee.</HI> So there is no cause, no room for the <HI>bitter Waters.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT we have now to do, is to shew, How the <HI>Bitter Waters</HI> of <HI>Marah,</HI> will be <HI>Sweetened,</HI> by a CHRIST Conversed withal? The followers of <HI>Gid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n,</HI> that so those might be discovered, whom GOD would Accept a∣mong them were to be brought unto the <HI>Wa∣ters,</HI> that so a <HI>Trial</HI> might be made of them there. My Friends, You are to be brought, even unto the <HI>bitter Waters,</HI> and it shall be tried, what Christians you are, and whether GOD will Accept you, or no, by This.</P>
<P>HOW does a CHRIST Conversed withal <HI>sweeten</HI> the <HI>bitter Waters</HI> to you? I remem∣ber what we read concerning the <HI>Afflicted</HI> People of GOD, [For so it should be read,] Isa. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>XIII. 9. <HI>In all their Affliction, there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Affliction.</HI> O you that are <HI>of a sorrowful Spirit,</HI> Let a CHRIST be Conversed withal,
<PB N="15" REF="002668_0020_0FE5F53F6EB73698"/>
and it shall be said of <HI>all your Affliction, There are no bitter Waters in it.</HI></P>
<P>First, IN <HI>Affliction</HI> a CHRIST Conversed withal, will take the <HI>Curse</HI> out of the <HI>bitter Waters.</HI> They were <HI>bitter Waters</HI> indeed, which of old Convey'd a <HI>Curse</HI> unto them, who had not been wronged in a <HI>Jealousy</HI> of their <HI>Adulteries.</HI> Truly, when <HI>Affliction</HI> comes upon us, we have <HI>bitter Waters</HI> in it, if it brings a <HI>Curse</HI> with it, and if it proceed from such a <HI>Wrath</HI> of GOD, as comes on the <HI>Children of Disobedience,</HI> and if it comes meer∣ly to Execute a <HI>Vengeance</HI> of Heaven upon us. Oh! most <HI>bitter Waters!</HI> But now, in a CHRIST Conversed withal, we shall see, this <HI>Curse</HI> taken out of our <HI>Affliction,</HI> by our SA∣VIOUR. He has bore the <HI>Curse</HI> of it, when He was made a <HI>Curse</HI> for us. O <HI>Child of Af∣fliction,</HI> Embrace the SAVIOUR who makes a Tender of Himself unto thee; put thy self under His Conduct; entreat of the Glorious GOD, that for the sake of the Atonement which He has made, Thy <HI>sins which are ma∣ny may be forgiven to thee.</HI> Now GOD is not in thy <HI>Affliction,</HI> only with a <HI>Punitive Justice</HI> Revenging Himself upon thee. Now the <HI>Affliction</HI> comes from a GOD, who Propounds to Convey <HI>Blessings</HI> unto thee with it. Now, in all thy <HI>Affliction,</HI> thy SAVIOUR is fulfil∣ling
<PB N="16" REF="002668_0021_0FE5F540A3BD8170"/>
that Word unto thee; Rev. III. 19. <HI>As many as I love I rebuke and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> He is Pro∣secuting Designs of <HI>Love,</HI> in what He does unto thee. The <HI>Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of <HI>bitter Waters,</HI> that is given to thee, thou hast the <HI>Love</HI> of thy SA∣VIOUR spicing of it. Thou mayst make this Conclusion; <HI>A Gracious GOD who is at Peace with me, thro' the</HI> CHRIST <HI>by the Faith of whom I am justified; HE tis that inflicts all my Dark and Sad Things upon me.</HI> And is not the Harshness of the <HI>bitter Waters</HI> now migh∣tily taken off!</P>
<P>Secondly. IN <HI>Affliction</HI> a CHRIST Conver∣sed withal, will show us how <HI>Kind an Hand</HI> it is, which dispenses unto us all the <HI>bitter Waters.</HI> Tis very sure, <HI>Affliction comes not forth of the Dust, nor does Trouble spring out of the Ground.</HI> The <HI>bitter Waters</HI> have an high∣er Source than so. There is the <HI>Providence</HI> of the Great GOD at Work, in all the <HI>Affliction</HI> that comes upon us: Yea, in the <HI>least thing</HI> that befals us. <HI>Not a Bird of the Air falls to the Earth</HI> without the <HI>Will</HI> of GOD. There is His All Reaching <HI>Providence</HI> at Work in all that befalls us. The very <HI>Hairs</HI> of our <HI>Heads</HI> as well as our <HI>Heads</HI> themselves are under the Inspection of it. Now the <HI>Administration</HI> of this <HI>Providence</HI> is committed into the Hands of our SAVIOUR. The GOD-MAN,
<PB N="17" REF="002668_0022_0FE5F54175891018"/>
even our <HI>Immanuel,</HI> or, the SON of GOD In∣carnate in our JESUS, does administer the Di∣vine Providence. The <HI>Man upon the Throne</HI> Governs the motions of all the <HI>Wheels</HI> in every Turn that happens in the World. He makes that claim; Mat. XXVIII. 18. <HI>All Power is given unto me, in heaven and in Earth.</HI> Now <HI>O Son of sorrow,</HI> I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thy <HI>Affliction</HI> let there be a CHRIST Conversed withal. Then say, From what <HI>Hand</HI> are the <HI>bitter Waters</HI> bro't unto thee?</P>
<P>IT may be, the <HI>Waters of a full Cup</HI> are <HI>poured out</HI> unto thee. But the <HI>Cup</HI> is in the <HI>Hand</HI> of a SAVIOUR who says unto thee, <HI>I will do thee no Hurt?</HI> Think, <HI>Who is it that orders all my Affliction for me? Tis a</HI> SAVIOUR, <HI>who has Loved me with an ever∣lasting Love. Tis a</HI> SAVIOUR <HI>who has died for me, and ever Lives to make Intercession for me, that I may be delivered from the Evil which my Sin has made me worthy of. Tis a</HI> SAVIOUR <HI>who has United me unto Himself, and will per∣mit nothing to be done unto me, but what a Member of His Body may have befalling of it.</HI> Oh! Scarce to be called, <HI>bitter Waters,</HI> that are found in a <HI>Cup,</HI> given by the <HI>Hand</HI> of such a SAVIOUR!</P>
<P>Thirdly. IN <HI>Affliction</HI> a CHRIST Conver∣sed withal, will Procure for us, Assure us of, Illustrious <HI>Benefits</HI> by the <HI>bitter Waters</HI> O

Mourner, who canst say, <HI>I am Afflicted very much:</HI> Get into a CHRIST, and keep nigh to a CHRIST; So thou shalt find, thy <HI>bitter Waters</HI> have no <HI>Poison</HI> in them. No; They will be <HI>Healing Waters.</HI> In all thy <HI>Affliction,</HI> thy SAVIOUR is but leading thee to <HI>Medi∣cinal Springs;</HI> Thou art carried unto the <HI>Waters;</HI> And the Effect shall be That; Isa. XXVII. 9. <HI>Iniquity shall be purged, and all the Fruit is to take away sin.</HI> Commit thyself unto the Care of a SAVIOUR, who is, <HI>The Lord thy Healer.</HI> Follow His Directions, for the use of the <HI>bitter Waters.</HI> Then be per∣swaded, the <HI>bitter Waters,</HI> They are given thee to clear thine <HI>Ey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sight,</HI> and give thee a better Knowledge of those Things <HI>which to know is Life Eternal:</HI> They are good for the <HI>Eyes!</HI> They are given thee, to carry off thy <HI>Vicious Humours;</HI> to <HI>cleanse</HI> thee from Im∣purities; to <HI>sweat</HI> out thy Corruptions. They are given thee, to sharpen thy <HI>Appetite</HI> for the Best Enjoyments; to quicken thy <HI>spirits</HI> for the Work before thee; to make thee <HI>Lively</HI> in the Things that are <HI>Holy and Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and Good.</HI> Think; <HI>All the Affliction, which for the present is not joyous but grievous; What will it afterwards yield unto us?

<PB N="19" REF="002668_0024_0FE5F54612A986E0"/>
be <HI>bitter Waters,</HI> that are so Sanative, so Balsamic, such Rich and Potent Cordials?</P>
<P>Fourthly; IN <HI>Affliction</HI> a CHRIST Conver∣sed withal, will show us a <HI>Conformity</HI> to Him in taking the <HI>bitter Waters.</HI> The <HI>Affliction</HI> of our <HI>bitter Waters,</HI> is that wherein we <HI>suffer</HI> with our SAVIOUR, and like him: We are brought unto That, Phil. III <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o. <HI>The Fellow∣ship of His Sufferings, being made Conformable unto His Death.</HI> O Disciple of the <HI>Cross,</HI> Here the Consideration of the <HI>Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss</HI> will come to be thrown into the <HI>bitter Waters</HI> of <HI>Marah,</HI> with a singular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fficacy.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY our SAVIOUR saw the <HI>bitter Waters,</HI> when He Cried out, <HI>Save me, O GOD, For the Waters are come into my Soul.</HI> Will it not <HI>sweeten</HI> thy <HI>bitter Waters,</HI> to see, <HI>These are but such Things as my</HI> SA∣VIOUR, <HI>has before me tasted of!</HI> Compare thy <HI>Affliction,</HI> with what befel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thy SAVIOUR, and see whether thine have not some evident <HI>Signatures</HI> of His upon it.

Surely, 'Twil do much towards the <HI>sweetening</HI> of the <HI>bitter Waters,</HI> to consider, <HI>My Affliction makes my condition more like that of my Humbled</HI> SAVI∣OUR. Yea, The <HI>bitter Waters</HI> are to <HI>Kill</HI> thee, that is to say, To <HI>Kill</HI> all thy Evil In∣clinations in thee; and make thee <HI>Dead</HI> in∣deed unto every Thing, but unto thy SAVI∣OUR; and make thee so <HI>Dead</HI> with CHRIST, that this World shall appear unto thee, as it does unto One a Dying upon a <HI>Cross.</HI> In this <HI>Death</HI> lies the <HI>Life</HI> of thy Soul. And as thou findest thy <HI>Killing Things</HI> to carry on this <HI>Death,</HI> in thee, thou hast more and more of an Astonishing <HI>Token for Good</HI> upon thee: Tis a <HI>Token,</HI> which will enable thee to say, <HI>Now I know that my</HI> SAVIOUR <HI>has Died for me: Now I know, that I shall come to all the Life which the Death of such a</HI> SAVIOUR <HI>can purchase for me. Yea, Now I know, there is a Life begun in me which no Death can ever give an Extinction to.</HI> Yea, a strange Thing will now come to pass; This Killed Servant of GOD, coming to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly upon a <HI>Death Bed,</HI> when he goes to think, <HI>I have nothing to do but to Dy,</HI> he is presently and pleasantly surprised into that Thought, <HI>No, Nor have I that neither,

<P>Fifthly. IN <HI>Affliction</HI> a CHRIST<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Conversed withal, will bring to us, That which will so <HI>supply</HI> the <HI>Want</HI> of all <HI>Creatures,</HI> as to make us Insensible of the <HI>bitter Waters.</HI> Tis an Essential stroke, in the Description of the Genuine Christian; Phil.

<P>WHAT Admirable Spectacles, has the Ar∣my of <HI>Martyrs</HI> afforded unto us!

<P>THE <HI>Tree</HI> that <HI>Sweetens</HI> the <HI>Bitter Waters</HI> is what Sweetened the <HI>Fires</HI> also to the Champions of GOD.</P>
<P>In Fine; MAKE the Experiment, and you will certainly find; That the Skill and Will, to make a Glorious CHRIST the continual Re∣sort of your Minds, by forming some Suita∣ble, Savoury, Precious Thoughts of Him, will Marvellously sweeten the most Bitter Waters that ever can be met withal. A Ser∣vant of GOD may sweetly say, <HI>O my GOD, I have parted with all the Things in this World; and I have but one Thing left unto me. This one Thing have I desired, and This will I seek after; That I may have a Glorious</HI> CHRIST, <HI>not only concerned for me, but also possessing of me; and that I may have Him continually dwel∣ling in my Thoughts, and furnishing me with the Precious Thoughts, wherein I may perpetually Feed and Live upon Him. I care not though I am dript of every thing else, if I may but enjoy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>licity.</HI> The Name of thy SAVIOUR

is, I AM. Think on all the Good thou hast Occasion for, and Hear Him, Yea, Feel Him saying, I AM <HI>all that that thou hast Occasion for.</HI></P>
<P>CHRISTIAN, While thou hast this Fe∣licity, no <HI>Bitter Waters</HI> can do any Damage to thee. GOD gives thee to Drink at the <HI>River of His Delights;</HI> The <HI>Lamb</HI> of GOD leads thee to <HI>Fountains of Living Waters.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, Returning back to an Evil World, whereof any one that has a <HI>Good Hope through Grace</HI> of a Better, must say, <HI>Wo is me that I S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>journ in it!</HI>—I know not what better Testimony to bring unto my Fel∣low-Travellers than This, Get as <HI>Near</HI> to a Glorious CHRIST, and as <HI>Full</HI> of Him, as ever you can; Oh! the <HI>Peace,</HI> Oh! the <HI>Joy,</HI> which you will find This to be the way of having your Souls Replenished withal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Oh!

The Hissing of <HI>Serpents</HI> Crawling in the Dark about the Streets, will give you no Disturbance. <HI>Death</HI> itself will no longer be the <HI>King of Terrors;</HI> but be Smiled on, be Closed with, be Longed for

<P>'TIS to be now Hoped, That all who are Sitting by any <HI>bitter Waters,</HI> and as it were hanging their <HI>Harps on the Willows</HI> there, will now consider every Bitterness as having in it, a Call unto them to come unto thy SA∣VIOUR.</P>

<P>THESE Admonitions and Consolations, are in a very Particular manner to be Address'd unto the Sorrowful Parents of Captain JO∣SIAH WINSLOW: With whom a <HI>Voice is Heard</HI> in <HI>Marshfield;</HI> A <HI>Lamenta∣tion, and Bitter Weeping,</HI> I hope, not a <HI>Re∣fusal to be Comforted.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Barbarous and Perfidious <HI>Indians</HI> in our Eastern Country, being <HI>Moved by the Instigation of the Devil</HI> and Father <HI>Rallee,</HI> have begun Hostilities upon us. They did it, when the <HI>French</HI> Hopes of a fatal Re∣volution on the <HI>British</HI> Empire, deceived them. And it was not long before the <HI>Hairy Scalp</HI> of that <HI>Head in the House of the Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> paid for what Hand he had in the <HI>Rebellion,</HI> into which he Infuriated his Proselytes.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>War,</HI> there have been several <HI>Actions</HI> done full of <HI>Courage;</HI> and several <HI>Disasters</HI> felt, full of Sorrow; and several <HI>Successes</HI> gain'd, full of <HI>Wonder;</HI> by our Various Par∣ties going out against the Rebels.</P>
<P>AMONG those who Generously exposed their Lives on the high Places of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
<PB N="28" REF="002668_0033_0FE5F68CA79F5368"/>
in this War, a very Particular Commemora∣tion is due, to Captain JOSIAH WINSLOW; a Young Gentleman, who was the Flowre and Hope of an Honourable Family; and has fallen Universally Lamented.</P>
<P>CONCERNING this Young Gentleman, I have seen this Account given by a Credible Person, that was Intimately Acquainted with him.</P>
<Q><P>AS he was a Young Man of a Beauti∣ful Countenance; of an Hail and Firm Constitution of Body, which enabled him to act with much Vigour, and under∣go the Hardships of the War; So he was of a Pleasant and Spritely Witt; of a Sweet Disposition; Of a Free and Gene∣rous Temper; Modest and Bashful in his Behaviour, Full of Life; and full of Love to every One: Of so Condescending a Spirit, that it sometimes drew him into Inconveniences: Obedient and Respectful to his Superiors; Kind to all; Far from Insulting over his Inferiors; which gain∣ed him great Respect from those that were Acquainted with him; and especially of the Souldiers that were under him; He was so far from taking any Advantage, that in their Streights and Difficulties, he has given sometimes to Poor Fellows
<PB N="29" REF="002668_0034_0FE5F692111DAB08"/>
that were in Necessity the Cloathes off his Back, to supply them: Which, to∣gether with his Forwardness on all Acti∣ons greatly endeared him to them, and caused him to be much Lamented by them.</P></Q>
<P>THE reach of the Mortal <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e</HI> at this Young Gentleman, is now to be Related: But one must feel <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> as was of old said, <HI>Not one single, Commotion of Soul, but a whole Assembly of Passi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns,</HI> moved at such a Relation. The Account being Obtained, partly, from a <HI>Christian Indian,</HI> that escaping out of the Slaughter, and while he lay hid, saw some of the Transactions; and partly from a Captive afterwards Redeemed from the <HI>Indians</HI> that made the Slaughter; Tis an Account that may be Depended on.</P>
<P>BEING left at <HI>Georges</HI> Fort, in command of the Garrison there, on the Thirtieth of <HI>April,</HI> 1724. He went from thence, with Se∣venteen Men in Two Whale-boats, down to an Island, called, The <HI>Green-Island,</HI> some Miles below the Fort; hoping to come at some <HI>Indians</HI> there, inasmuch as there had several times been seen <HI>In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ns</HI> pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing thi∣ther in a Canoe, it being a notable fowling-place. He was observed for diverse Hours before he went upon this Action, to retire,
<PB N="30" REF="002668_0035_0FE5F6933B4FDE50"/>
very Serious and Pensive; and no doubt, full of such Thoughts as might have a Tendency to Prepare his Young Soul, for that F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>licity, which would accomplish the <HI>Particular Faith</HI> which the <HI>Travailing Soul</HI> of his Gracious Mother [a <HI>Sarah</HI> now become a <HI>Marah!</HI>] had received and expressed for him▪ And he let fall Words to the Company which he left behind him, that seem'd somewhat Pre∣sagious of what he was going to. When they came to the Island, they haled up their Boats among the Bushes; and lay close all the Night, &amp; the next Day until almost Night. Not see∣ing any <HI>Indians,</HI> they then went off the Island in their Boats, when the Sun was about Two Hours High <HI>(Friday)</HI> in the Afternoon. The Divine Providence Ordered it▪ that this was what might be called, a Launching into the <HI>Mare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mortuum.</HI> After their going down to this Island, a great Body of <HI>Indians,</HI> of the <HI>Penobscot</HI>-Tribe, (with some others,) the party that af∣terwards took the Vessels at <HI>Cap-Sables,</HI> to the Number as was Judged, of Two or Three Hundred Men, came down the River in their Canoes, and lodged themselves with their Canoes, on both sides of the River betwixt the Island and the Fort. Here they lay un∣discovered by ours, as ours were by them, until they put off in their Boats from the Island. After they had come some Distance
<PB N="31" REF="002668_0036_0FE5F6954149BE10"/>
from the Island, Capt. <HI>Winslow</HI> being in the foremost Boat, and Sergeant <HI>Harvy</HI> in the other, there came a Flock of Fowl within Shot of <HI>Harvy'</HI>s, at which one of the Men Imprudently made a Shot, and knock'd down a Fowl in the Water. <HI>Harvy</HI> turning to take up the <HI>Fowl,</HI> Capt. <HI>Winslow</HI> advised him, that it was best he should not follow the Fowl, but that they should keep together; for, said he, <HI>We know not what we may meet with, before we reach the Fort. Harvy</HI> replied, <HI>Syr, If you will go easy upon your Oars, I will be presently up with you:</HI> But following the Fowl too long, and going too near one side of the River, the <HI>Indians</HI> let fly from the shore upon <HI>Harvy</HI> and killed Three of his Men. Sergeant <HI>Harvy</HI> found himself obliged imme∣diately to land; where he was quickly kil∣led, and all the Men with him, except Three of our <HI>Christian Indians</HI> that were with him in this Expedition, who found their way to escape, and got safe unto the Fort. <HI>Harvy</HI> fought with abundance of Courage; and so did the Men that were with him; The <HI>Wolves</HI> found that they had <HI>Lions</HI> to engage withal. When the <HI>Indians</HI> Fired upon <HI>Har∣vy,</HI> Capt. <HI>Winslow,</HI> though he had gone slowly on his Oars, was got near half a Mile a head. But seeing the <HI>Indians</HI> Fire upon <HI>Harvy,</HI> his Manly, Friendly, Ingenuous &amp; Courageous
<PB N="32" REF="002668_0037_0FE5F1AF6A11E5C0"/>
Heart could not bear to leave them in their Distress; but immediately put about his Boat, that he might hasten to their Succour. Before he could get near them, he found himself Surrounded with between Thirty and Forty Canoes; whereof several had four or six Men a piece aboard; which came off from both sides of the River, and attack'd him with great Fury. They set up an hide∣ous Yelling &amp; Howling, expecting thereby so to have daunted them, as to have taken our small Handful without much Resistance: But in this their expectation failed them; for Capt. <HI>Winslow</HI> and his Brave Handful, notwithstanding the Horror of their Ap∣proach, and tho' so out-numbered, and like to be Over-powered, by such a Multitude of the <HI>Dragons of the Wilderness,</HI> made ready to give them a warm Reception. The <HI>In∣dians</HI> enclosing of him with their Canoes, in∣tended at once to have him aboard: But when they were almost come aboard him, he Fired upon them; Notwithstanding which, they came up to the sides of his Boat where he and his few men defended themselves, and beat off the <HI>Indians</HI> with the Butt-ends of their Muskets▪ This they did with such Magnanimity and Resolution, that the <HI>Indians</HI> recoiled, retired, and fell off, and fought at a distance. They were
<PB N="33" REF="002668_0038_0FE5F6967985C0F8"/>
so struck with Admiration at Young WINS∣LOW'S Courage, that they offered him Quar∣ter, if he would Surrender himself &amp; Com∣pany; But he refused it: Knowing their <HI>Tender Mercies</HI> to be <HI>Cruelties,</HI> and chusing rather to lay down his Life in the Service of his Country, than fall into the Hands of such Faithless and Cruel and Bloody Salvages. Thus he kept Fighting in his Boat, until the Dusk of Evening; when, the most of his Men being Slain, he put ashore with Two or Three that were left; where being way-laid by the <HI>Indians,</HI> they were all cut off.</P>
<P>WE are told, that he being shot down, and having his Thigh broken, the <HI>Indians,</HI> when they saw him fall, ran towards him: And yet then he recovered on his other knee, and shot down another <HI>Indian.</HI></P>
<P>HOW many of the Enemy fell in this En∣counter, we can have yet no certain Account, But certainly, they had little to Boast off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ except their having bereaved us, of a <HI>Desira∣ble Young Man,</HI> Of whom there were many, besides his Honourable and Religious Parents, who said, <HI>This same shall Comfort us.</HI> Thus Died a Valiant an Accomplished, a Good-natured, Young Gentleman, in the Twenty Third year of his Age; in the Defence of a Country▪ and a People, for which how many Brave Lives have been Sacrificed!

<HEAD>MANTISSA. A Copy of a LETTER Sent unto Colonel WINSLOW, and his Consort, from a Minister at some Distance from them, on the first Advice of the Green-Island Tragedy. Here Published for the Benefit of some others in the like Circumstances.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the <HI>general Condolence</HI> with You, upon the Sorrow, which You have lately met withal, I take a very Particular <HI>Share,</HI> and think it my▪ Duty to give you some Expressions of it.</P>
<P>BUT how can I better express it, than in my earnest <HI>Supplications,</HI> which I therefore make to the Glorious Lord, that he would enable You to Glorify him in the <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> which he now calls You to?</P>
<P>IF not a <HI>Bird of the Air</HI> falls to the <HI>Earth</HI> with∣out the Will of our Heavenly Father; You may be sure that the <HI>Child</HI> Hatch'd under your tender Wing, is not fallen without the Will of Heaven Ordering of it. And You cannot have a better Proof that you are the <HI>Children of</HI> GOD, than by Your Patient Submission to his Will on such an Occasion; and your Submissive saying, <HI>The Cup which my Father has given me, shall not I Drink it?</HI> The <HI>Cup</HI> which is now given You indeed is <HI>Bitter</HI> enough; But if the sense of the
<PB N="36" REF="002668_0041_0FE5F1B436158520"/>
<HI>Hand</HI> which it comes from, and of the <HI>End</HI> which his Wisdom and Goodness has in giving it, quiets You, His Comfortable Voice unto You is, <HI>I will be a Father to You.</HI> And being thus <HI>His Children,</HI> You have a <HI>Better Name,</HI> than what the <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Daughter</HI> he has Obliged You to part withal, could have help'd You to.</P>
<P>IT is a great <HI>Sacrifice,</HI> that you are now put upon. But You will approve yourselves the Genuine Children of <HI>Abraham:</HI> And so prove Your Claim to the Blessings of His <HI>Covenant,</HI> if you overcome the <HI>Reluctancles of Nature</HI> to it.—<HI>Withhold not</HI> the <HI>Child</HI> whom Thou hast <HI>Loved,</HI> When GOD calls you to offer it up. So it shall be said, <HI>Now I know, that thou Fearest</HI> GOD. And verily, there is more <HI>Solid Comfort</HI> in this Assurance, than there can be in the Enjoyment of any <HI>Child,</HI> whereof You might say, <HI>This same shall Comfort us.</HI> Your <HI>Blessedness</HI> in the World to come, will be in an Holy <HI>Priesthood.</HI> And that You may be in this World, <HI>Initiated</HI> for it, Your SAVIOUR, will now have You to be <HI>Holy Sacrificers.</HI> You will be notably such, when up∣on the Death of Lovely and Hopeful Children, You <HI>hold your Peace,</HI> and only say, <HI>The will of the Lord be Done,</HI> and beg of Him, that the Influences of his <HI>Grace</HI> may effectually Subdue all the Rebellion of yours against it.</P>
<P>A <HI>Trial,</HI> yea, an exquisite one, is now made, whether there be any thing, which at the plain Call of GOD you cannot resign unto Him? or, whether you will not now Seek and Hope to find that <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in having a Glorious CHRIST Concerned for You, and Conversing with You,
<PB N="37" REF="002668_0042_0FE5F69DFB351AC0"/>
which we expect <HI>in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain</HI> from the <HI>Creatures,</HI> that forever are found to be no better than <HI>Lying, Va∣nities.</HI> If being thus <HI>Tried,</HI> you come forth as <HI>Gold,</HI> and approve yourselves <HI>Noble Sacrificers,</HI> it will be an infallible <HI>Token for Good,</HI> that you have a part in the <HI>Grand Sacrifice,</HI> which Your SAVI∣OUR has offered for His People, and shall have a Part among those, whom the Blood of the <HI>Lam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> will bring to walk in <HI>White</HI> Robes and Serve Him in His <HI>Temple.</HI></P>
<P>MOST certainly, if the repeated Strokes of <HI>Mortality</HI> on Your Family, be of Use unto You▪ to <HI>bring Sin unto Remembrance,</HI> and carry on <HI>Re∣pentance to its Perfect</HI> Work; to animate Your <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Cares</HI> that You may be <HI>Entire</HI> and <HI>Perfect</HI> in Your Essays to Conform unto the <HI>whole Will of</HI> GOD; to Wean You from a <HI>World</HI> where∣in You see an End of all Perfection; and make You Seek the Things, that are Above, and quick∣en Your Thorough Preparation for Your own <HI>Death,</HI> which the <HI>Death</HI> of such <HI>Relatives</HI> does loudly Admonish You to be daily looking for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P>THESE Blessings will be a Rich and Full <HI>Compensation</HI> for the Loss of what has been taken from You. True PIETY will dispose You to count them so. <HI>Death</HI> in such a way brings the Truest <HI>Life</HI> with it; yea, What is <HI>Better than Life.</HI> And <HI>Light</HI> will arise unto You in the <HI>Darkness,</HI> which <HI>Death</HI> has brought upon Your <HI>Tabernacle.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, there is the less need of my expatiating unto You upon these <HI>Consolations</HI> of GOD, since You have an excellent <HI>Pastor,</HI> who has You under his continual Cultivations, and Loves Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u ex∣ceedingly,
