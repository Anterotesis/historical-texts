<HEAD>The Occasion.</HEAD>
<P>A Man whose Name was JEREMIAH FENWICK, was upon a Fair Trial brought in GUILTY of having Murdered his Neighbour with an <HI>Axe,</HI> which he took up, and Employed a Repeted Blow thereof, at a Person at whom his Anger was Enraged.</P>
<P>After he received the Sentence of DEATH for the Fact, the great pains taken by the Ministers of BOSTON for his Instruction and Conversion, were not without some good Effects, and Symptoms of <HI>Re∣pentance</HI> upon him; One of which might be his Desire to have a SER∣MON of such a Tendency Prea∣ched; as is here Published, that so such Ends as did appear to be de∣sired by the poor Man, may be yet more generally answered.</P>
<P>For which purpose, his <HI>Dying Speech,</HI> is also annexed.</P>

<P>ANGER resteth in the Bosom of Fools.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OUR People are at this time Entertained with a <HI>Spectacle,</HI> upon which our <HI>Heart</HI> is Exceed∣dingly hardened, if we cannot say, <HI>My Eye affecteth my Heart.</HI> The sad <HI>Spectacle</HI> is a Man who <HI>dies before his Time,</HI> with this Lamentation in his Mouth, <HI>I have slain a Man to my wounding, and a Neighbour to my Hurt.</HI> It will be our Happiness, and it is what the
<PB N="4" REF="001898_0004_0FB9D39804C2E710"/>glorious GOD requires of us; to make an Holy Improvement of such an unhappy <HI>Spectacle.</HI> How can it be better improv'd, than by a due Attention to the Warnings of GOD against the <HI>Vice,</HI> which has <HI>Mur∣dered</HI> this poor Man, and push'd him upon a <HI>Murder!</HI> I shall bring forth a bloody <HI>Murderer</HI> among you; It shall be <HI>Arraigned</HI> and <HI>Indicted</HI> for doing of horrid Things amongst us, not having the <HI>Fear of GOD before its Eyes,</HI> but being <HI>moved by the Instigation of the Devil.</HI> It shall be <HI>stoned</HI> before the Lord; Join with me, my Hearers, in the <HI>stoning</HI> of it. It has here killed One poor Man, in hurrying him on to kill another. It has the Seed of all <HI>mischief,</HI> and even of <HI>Murder</HI> in it. You are doubtless willing to know the Name of the <HI>Murderer</HI> upon whom I have this Design. I inform you then, UNGOVERNED ANGER, I say, UNGOVERNED ANGER is the Malefactor. Behold, A Man dying a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to the
<PB N="5" REF="001898_0005_0FB9D398F6437EA8"/><HI>Folly</HI> of UNGOVERNED ANGER: which certainly is, <HI>To dy as a Fool dieth!</HI> 'Tis UNGOVERNED AN∣GER that has brought all this up∣on him. UNGOVERNED AN∣GER; How <HI>Fatal</HI> a <HI>Folly!</HI> And yet, how <HI>Frequent</HI> a <HI>Folly!</HI> This is that <HI>Error</HI> against which, in the Lamentable Circumstances of this poor Man, <HI>Lo, GOD sends forth his Voice, and it is a mighty Voice.</HI> Oh! Let it have a due Attention from us: Let all <HI>Israel Hear and Fear,</HI> and let that <HI>Foolish Passion</HI> be no more indulged among us.</P>
<P>If I should say, That the <HI>Sacri∣fice</HI> of the least Good Thing in the World, unto UNGOVERNED ANGER, is the <HI>Sacrifice of a Fool,</HI> I have read unto you a Text from whence the Assertion would be Justified.</P>
<P>My Text is found in a Book, which contains the Wise and Just Sentiments of a <HI>Soul</HI> upon the Strokes of <HI>Recollection:</HI> A Soul <HI>Repenting</HI> of the <HI>Follies</HI> Commit∣ted
<PB N="6" REF="001898_0006_0FB9D39A80AE1668"/>in straying from GOD, and Sinning against Him. One of them is a <HI>Disswasive</HI> Employ'd upon UN∣GOVERNED ANGER; One of those <HI>Follies,</HI> which make abundance of work for <HI>Repentance</HI> among the Children of Men. We are disswa∣ded from it in those Terms, <HI>Be not Hasty in thy Spirit to be Angry:</HI> And we have this Potent Argu∣ment offered; <HI>For Anger resteth in the Bosom of Fools.</HI> How, <HI>Resteth in their Bosom?</HI> The meaning is, It has a <HI>Lodging</HI> in their Heart. They allow it a <HI>Lodging</HI> there. Such a <HI>Lodging</HI> that it is ready to make its Appearance upon the least Occurrence that can be; Such a <HI>Lodging</HI> that it Abides, it Remains, it is not Eafily parted with. UNGOVERNED ANGER is intended, by the <HI>Resting of An∣ger in the Bosom:</HI> And I shall suf∣ficiently keep to the Intention of my Text, by giving you this DOCTRINE from it.</P>

<HEAD>ƲNGOVERNED ANGER is a ve∣ry Foolish Thing; has very much Folly in it.</HEAD>
<P>A Man must <HI>Govern</HI> his <HI>Anger,</HI> and Regulate and Moderate and Mortify that <HI>unruly Passion,</HI> if he would not be as <HI>one of the Fools in Israel.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis well-known, and it may be, <HI>too well</HI>-known, That <HI>Anger</HI> is one of those <HI>Passions,</HI> whereinto the Mind of Man is moved, when Displeasing Objects are before it. ANGER; An <HI>Affection</HI> stirr'd in the Soul, by <HI>Evils</HI> that hinder the Satisfaction of it; and an <HI>Affection</HI> that stirs up the Soul hastily to remove those <HI>Evils:</HI> A Mind that should not have this <HI>Affection</HI> in it, were a Maimed and a Lamed Soul and must <HI>halt</HI> in many of its Motions. But, alas, Mankind is more liable to an <HI>Excess</HI> than a <HI>Defect</HI> of this <HI>Affection. Anger,</HI> 'tis like <HI>Fire;</HI> And, as <HI>Fire,</HI> so
<PB N="8" REF="001898_0008_0FB9D3A680D04C38"/><HI>Anger,</HI> 'tis a <HI>Good Servant,</HI> but a <HI>Bad Master.</HI> Nevertheless how much oftener is it a <HI>Master</HI> than a <HI>Servant?</HI> Mankind is an <HI>Angry</HI> sort of a Thing; and the Hearts that have Naturally <HI>Fire</HI> in them, are too often made more Criminally <HI>Hot,</HI> by being <HI>set on Fire of Hell.</HI> UNGOVERNED ANGER is a Vice by which the Quiet of the World, is very much Disturbed; It is the Grand <HI>Incendiary</HI> of the World. Every Man has enough to do, to bring Water for the Ex∣tinguishing of the Flames raised by this <HI>Incendiary.</HI> My Buckets are now to be thrown upon them; And perhaps, it is hardly possible for you to be Entertained on a CASE of a more general and Ex∣tensive Importance than this;</P>

<HEAD>By what Rules are we to Govern our selves, that the Follies of ƲNGO∣VERNED ANGER may be a∣voided?</HEAD>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001898_0009_0FB9D3A7579D0758"/>
There was a Caution once given; Judg. XVIII. 25. <HI>Let not thy Voice be heard among us, lest Angry Folks run upon thee.</HI> But I don't use to be afraid of the <HI>Fools.</HI> It is now Especially to <HI>Angry Folks,</HI> that my <HI>Voice</HI> is to be directed. But the whole Auditory is deeply con∣cern'd. Let every Person in it, be <HI>flow to wrath, and receive with Meek∣ness, the Word,</HI> which, Oh! how well would it be for us, if it might be <HI>Engrafted into our Souls!</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 'Tis the <HI>Grace</HI> of MEEKNESS, which is to deliver us from the <HI>Follies</HI> of UNGOVERNED AN∣GER; A <HI>Grace</HI> how much to be wished for, to be studied for, to be laboured for! — <HI>The meekness of Wisdom.</HI> An Ornament often and highly Commended in the Oracles of GOD! — <HI>Glorious Things are spoken of thee, O thou Ornament of Christianity!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>meekness</HI> to be desired is, that whereof we read; Gal. V. 22,
<PB N="10" REF="001898_0010_0FB9D3A8B8D1CAA8"/>23, <HI>The Fruit of the Spirit, is meek∣ness.</HI> And it being a <HI>Grace</HI> which is a <HI>Fruit</HI> of the Holy <HI>Spirit,</HI> it is peculiar to them, whom the Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> has Renewed and Quickened; and who have begun to <HI>live unto GOD.</HI> It is the <HI>meekness,</HI> which is <HI>put on</HI> by the <HI>Elect of GOD,</HI> who are become <HI>Holy and Beloved.</HI> My Friend, Until a Principle of PIETY have animated thy Soul, it will be a Stranger to the True, Right, Genuine <HI>Meekness;</HI> UNGOVER∣NED ANGER will be one of thy unhealed Maladies.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>Meekness</HI> of <HI>Complexi∣on,</HI> wherewith some are advantaged. They are of a more stayed, a more settled, a more composed Humour than other Men; and so <HI>Phlegmatick</HI> is their <HI>Complexion,</HI> that they be not soon Enraged. There is also a <HI>Meekness</HI> of <HI>Morality,</HI> wherewith some are Beautified. Rational Con∣templations of pure <HI>Philosophy,</HI> have mightily composed their Souls; and the Lessons of <HI>Morality</HI> have
<PB N="11" REF="001898_0011_0FB9D3B0E6A737C8"/>sweetly tempered them. Yea, But the <HI>Meekness</HI> after which we are to aspire, should be of an Higher elevation in Christianity; It should be nothing short of that; Jam. III. 17. <HI>The Wisdom that is from above, which is Peaceable, Gentle, Easy to be Entreated.</HI></P>
<P>I will give one Remarable Dif∣ference, between the <HI>Meekness</HI> of meer <HI>Nature;</HI> and that more <HI>Spi∣ritual Meekness</HI> which a Mind Rec∣tified by the Holy <HI>Spirit</HI> of GOD arrives unto. The <HI>Meekness</HI> of meer <HI>Nature</HI> is equally Insensible under all sorts of <HI>Provocations.</HI> But the <HI>Meekness</HI> of a <HI>Sanctified Mind</HI> is not so. In the former <HI>Meekness</HI> Men are as unconcerned about A∣buses offered unto GOD, as they are about Abuses offered unto <HI>them∣selves.</HI> But in the latter <HI>Meekness</HI> it is not so. We are to be Easy, when Abuses are offered unto <HI>our selves.</HI> And this from a Principle of <HI>Obedience</HI> and <HI>Submission</HI> unto GOD. At the same Time, when
<PB N="12" REF="001898_0012_0FB9D3B1C32E50D8"/>Abuses are offered unto our glori∣ous GOD, Now a Certain Com∣motion of <HI>Zeal</HI> should-be raised in us. <HI>Now</HI> we should be <HI>Zealous,</HI> be Troubled, be grieved. <HI>Now</HI> with an Holy <HI>Anger</HI> we should let it be seen, <HI>Things are not, as we should have them to be!</HI> A <HI>Meek</HI> Man should say, <HI>In aliis Mansuetus ero; at in Injuriis contra Christum non ita.</HI> No <HI>Injuries</HI> but what are offered unto GOD, shall make any Impressions on my <HI>Mansuetude.</HI></P>
<P>Briefly. 'Tis praescribed, Eph. IV. 26. <HI>Be Angry, but do not Sin.</HI> The Rule for this would be, <HI>Be Angry at nothing but Sin.</HI> I humbly con∣ceive, That this may be fairly main∣tained, as the <HI>Golden Rule</HI> of <HI>Meck∣ness.</HI> If you would not <HI>Sin</HI> in your <HI>Anger,</HI> let nothing but <HI>Sin</HI> be the Object of your <HI>Anger.</HI> If <HI>Anger</HI> begin to boil, Examine, <HI>Is there any Sin against GOD committed, in what I am going to be Angry at?</HI> If there be None, it will be <HI>Meekness of Wisdom</HI> to throw away no <HI>Anger</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="001898_0013_0FB9D3B508DED020"/>upon it. That so a <HI>Gracious Meek∣ness</HI> may adorn us;</P>
<P>First. We are to make our <HI>Sup∣plications</HI> and <HI>Resignations,</HI> unto the Holy SPIRIT of GOD our SA∣VIOUR; to obtain the Grace of <HI>Meekness</HI> from Him. It was En∣joyned of old, <HI>Seek ye the Lord, All ye Meek of the Earth.</HI> 'Tis now to be the Injunction laid upon us all, <HI>Seek ye the Lord, That ye may be made the Meek of the Earth</HI> Yea, <HI>Seek Meekness,</HI> is the Thing Ex∣presly directed to. When <HI>Meek∣ness</HI> is called for, there is that Di∣rection given for the obtaining of it; Jam. 1.5. <HI>If any of you lack Wis∣dom, let him ask of GOD, and it shall be given him;</HI>—The <HI>Wisdom</HI> to steer clear of UNGOVERNED ANGER, with a <HI>Spirit of Meekness.</HI> My <HI>Angry</HI> Brother, Carry that <HI>Fro∣ward Heart</HI> of thine unto the Ho∣ly SPIRIT of GOD thy SAVIOUR, and plead, <HI>O my GOD, I have the Heart of a fierce Tyger in me, but thou canst change my Heart, and make
<PB N="14" REF="001898_0014_0FB9D3B7CAF71160"/>me as meek as a Lamb. I put my Heart into thy Hand; O do Thou take possession of it, and keep down and put out those Hellish Fires, that are too Easily kindled there!</HI> When <HI>Eli∣phaz</HI> imagined, that <HI>Job</HI> was too fretful, he told him, <HI>I doubt, Thou Restrainest Prayer.</HI> Certainly, If our <HI>Fretting</HI> don't kill our <HI>Praying,</HI> our <HI>Praying</HI> will do much to Cure our <HI>Fretting.</HI> We are bidden, to <HI>List up Holy Hands without Wrath.</HI> Let us do it <HI>Against Wrath,</HI> and anon we shall not only <HI>Pray without Wrath,</HI> but also <HI>Live without</HI> it. But if a Man have a <HI>Cholerick Devil</HI> obstinately infesting of him;—it may be, <HI>The Kind will not go out with∣out Fasting and Prayer.</HI> Certainly, That <HI>Extraordinary Method,</HI> may be worth taking, rather than have such a <HI>Devil resting in our Bosom.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Having so <HI>sought Meek∣ness,</HI> let us now proceed unto the <HI>Exercises</HI> of it.</P>
<P>You are aware; That <HI>Meekness</HI> does not propose to <HI>Destroy</HI> our
<PB N="15" REF="001898_0015_0FB9D3B94F55BC48"/><HI>Anger,</HI> but only to Govern it. It may sometimes be not only <HI>Lawful,</HI> but also <HI>Needful,</HI> to be <HI>Angry.</HI> That most Consummate <HI>Pattern</HI> and <HI>Fountain</HI> of <HI>all Goodness,</HI> our SAVI∣OUR Himself, when he had some Sinful People about Him, we read, Mar. III. 5. <HI>He looked round about on them with Anger. Goodness</HI> it self may have <HI>Anger</HI> in it; <HI>Meekness</HI> it self may be <HI>Angry.</HI> But then, First; <HI>Meekness</HI> must <HI>Govern</HI> our <HI>Anger,</HI> as to the Reasons of it. You must be <HI>well-advised</HI> by <HI>Meekness,</HI> a∣gainst that <HI>Weakness,</HI> of being, <HI>An∣gry without a Cause;</HI> Lest you be <HI>pleased</HI> no otherwise than,—you know how! Particularly; Be sure, To be <HI>Angry</HI> at <HI>a Good Thing;</HI> This cannot be Good. When the words of GOD in <HI>Sound Doctrines,</HI> or in <HI>Just Reproofs</HI> are brought un∣to us, 'tis a Wicked Thing to be <HI>Angry</HI> at them. A Wickedness exemplified by the Hearers of our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; Act. VII. 54. <HI>When they heard these thing, they gnashed on
<PB N="16" REF="001898_0016_0FB9D3C19BD993E0"/>him with their Teeth.</HI> Nor is it any Better to be <HI>Angry</HI> at the <HI>Works</HI> of GOD, either in our own <HI>Adversity,</HI> or in the <HI>Prosperity</HI> of others, or suppose, the Accidents of the Wea∣ther disappointing of us. <HI>Jonah</HI> has the leaves of his <HI>Alcherva</HI> failing him; And now, <HI>Dost thou well to be Angry,</HI> Jonah? Hush; Do not say, Thou Dost! But then, I will go on with my Limitations, Take these Two; Be not <HI>Angry for No∣thing;</HI> and, Be not <HI>Angry for Every Thing.</HI> Both of these are Exor∣bitances. Your <HI>Anger</HI> should not be <HI>for Nothing.</HI> If you are <HI>Angry</HI> you should be Able to give a suf∣ficient, and a significant Account, <HI>why you are so!</HI> Not fret and fume for you know not what your selves: Nor upon a meer mistake, a meer Fancy, and ungrounded suspicion; some wrong Information. Over all your <HI>Anger,</HI> and all that you do or speak in your <HI>Anger</HI> be able to say with him; I Sam. XVII. 29. <HI>Is there not a Cause?</HI> Nor should
<PB N="17" REF="001898_0017_0FB9D3C48476EDD8"/><HI>Anger</HI> be <HI>for Every Thing.</HI> What? For the Landing of every little Skiff, to set the Becons on Fire? By no means. To be <HI>Angry,</HI> for every Trifle: Upon the breaking of a Glass, the spilling of a <HI>Cup,</HI> every little Blunder of a <HI>Servant,</HI> some small Disrespect shown to our <HI>Character,</HI> presently an uprore to be made in our Souls! By no means. About your <HI>Anger</HI> take that Ad∣vice; Jam. I. 19. <HI>Let every Man be slow to speak, slow to wrath.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>Meekness</HI> must <HI>Govern</HI> our <HI>Anger</HI> as to the <HI>Seasons</HI> of it. If you are <HI>Angry out of Time,</HI> Ve∣rily, your Spirit is out of <HI>Tune.</HI> You make wretched <HI>Jars,</HI> if you don't <HI>keep Time</HI> in your <HI>Anger.</HI> There are Two Cautions to be ten∣dred you.</P>
<P>One Caution is this; You must not be <HI>Angry</HI> too <HI>Soon.</HI> What a Reprimand have our short-winded, hasty, huffy People, given to them! In Prov. XIV. 17. <HI>He that is soon Angry, dealeth foolishly.</HI> Syrs, My
<PB N="18" REF="001898_0018_0FB9D3C6168CDB90"/>proposal is worth hearkening to; Never be <HI>Angry</HI> without first <HI>Pausing</HI> a little, and Thinking, <HI>Will my Anger be proper here?</HI> There was an Heathen Emperor, who would not permit his <HI>Anger</HI> to break forth at any thing, until he had made such a pause, as to recite the Let∣ters of the <HI>Alphabet.</HI> There was a Christian Emperor, who would not permit the Indignations of <HI>An∣ger</HI> at any thing to boil within him, until he had made such a pause as to recite, <HI>The Lords Prayer.</HI> Thus the Brave Men, that had <HI>Rule over other Men,</HI> in this gave a Demonstration that they could <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves</HI> also. A Glorious <HI>Domi∣nion,</HI> and that without which, Be it known to you, O Men of Quality, No <HI>Dominion</HI> will be Glorious. A <HI>Delay</HI> of <HI>Anger,</HI> until the fittest minute for the working of it; How Profitable, how Serviceable, would it be; what <HI>Praecipitations</HI> would it save us from! The <HI>Discretion of a Man,</HI> is never more Conspicuous,
<PB N="19" REF="001898_0019_0FB9D3C905E59520"/>than when he <HI>Deferreth his Anger.</HI> I question, Whether any Man ever found himself a <HI>Loser</HI> by doing so. This I am sure of; <HI>He that is slow to Anger is better than the mighty.</HI></P>
<P>Another Caution is this; You must not be <HI>Angry</HI> too <HI>Long.</HI> It is the Apostolical Charge; Eph. IV. 26. <HI>Let not the Sun go down in your Wrath.</HI> I hope, you would not have the <HI>Sun</HI> carry such a story of you, to the People of the other Haemisphaere, <HI>That you are Implacable.</HI> Our <HI>Anger,</HI> like the <HI>Manna</HI> of old, will stink, if it be kept until the next Morning: But in this thing otherwise than the <HI>Manna,</HI> That it <HI>Stinks</HI> worst of all, when kept un∣til the <HI>Sabbath.</HI> We should not give such an <HI>Evil Spirit</HI> leave to stay a Night under the Roof with us. The Apostle in this passage, may allude unto the Law; <HI>If a Man have Committed a Sin worthy of Death, and he be put to Death, and they hang him on a Tree, his Body shall not re∣main all night upon the Tree; thou
<PB N="20" REF="001898_0020_0FB9D3CA97B54A48"/>must bury him in any wise that very Day.</HI> Even so; If a Man have Committed a Sin worthy of thy <HI>Wrath,</HI> yet thy Angry Resentment thereof, must not <HI>remain all night;</HI> Thou shalt <HI>bury</HI> it <HI>in any wise, that very Day.</HI> Yea, There is a <HI>Cursed Carcase</HI> hanging in thy Soul, as long as <HI>Anger</HI> is discomposing of thee. Syrs, I have another proposal, which will be worth hearkening to; going to <HI>Rest,</HI> every Night, make it a <HI>Rest</HI> indeed, by being able to say, <HI>There is no body in the World, but what my mind is in an Easy Frame unto!</HI> This I will <HI>affirm Constantly.</HI> An <HI>Immortal Anger</HI> very ill becomes <HI>Mortal People.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>Meekness</HI> must <HI>Govern</HI> our <HI>Anger,</HI> as to the <HI>Measures</HI> of it. If we must be <HI>Angry,</HI> yet, why <HI>Raving?</HI> Why <HI>Frantick?</HI> Why like a slated House on Flame, so vio∣lent that there shall be no coming anear you! If <HI>Angry,</HI> yet what need of being Transported into a <HI>Fury?</HI> and Flinging Things to and fro,
<PB N="21" REF="001898_0021_0FB9D3CFEB5A9260"/>as if you were mad? Fy, for shame! Why must you fall to <HI>Railing,</HI> why to <HI>Revenge,</HI> on the Person whom your <HI>Anger</HI> is pointed at? I'l show you a picture of this <HI>Anger!</HI> 'Tis in I Sam. XX. 30. <HI>Then Sauls Anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou Son of the Perverse, Rebellious Woman!</HI> What a <HI>madman</HI> is here? He calls his own Son, <HI>A Whores-bird?</HI>— The <HI>Anger</HI> is <HI>unbounded,</HI> when it breaks forth into <HI>Reproaching,</HI> into <HI>Reviling,</HI> into <HI>Taunts</HI> and unman∣nerly Expressions. But what, when into <HI>Blows,</HI> from a <HI>Fist of Wicked∣ness? Blows;</HI> and it may be a poor <HI>Beast</HI> must feel them too. <HI>Brutish, Anger,</HI> and such as degrades the <HI>Man</HI> down into the very <HI>Class</HI> that he quarrels with! So <HI>Balaam;</HI> his <HI>Anger was Kindled,</HI> and he <HI>Smote the Ass with a Staff!</HI> An <HI>Anger</HI> that will spend it self in outrages upon an <HI>Horse,</HI> upon a <HI>Dog,</HI> upon a <HI>Tool</HI> that fails us; how worse than <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dish</HI> is it! I may say, <HI>Cursed
<PB N="22" REF="001898_0022_0FB9D3D424F862D0"/>is their Anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel!</HI> One thing more is to be spoken. Be∣ware of making any <HI>Vows,</HI> in your <HI>Anger; Vows</HI> dictated by <HI>Anger;</HI> The worst Counsellor in the World! <HI>Vows,</HI> wherein the <HI>Third Com∣mandment</HI> is horribly Violated ! And, Oh! Beware of all <HI>Angry Imprecations;</HI> All <HI>Wishes</HI> that carry <HI>Curses</HI> in them: All <HI>Wishes</HI> of any Damage to your selves or others. An <HI>Elias</HI> himself had need keep a Watch over himself, when <HI>Anger</HI> shall indispose him. Especially, let provoked <HI>Parents</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> such Ebullitions. <HI>Parents,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> un∣dutiful Children give you any <HI>Pro∣vocations?</HI> Take heed that your <HI>An∣ger</HI> do not throw out any <HI>impreca∣tions</HI> upon them. 'Tis a Thousand to One, that a Righteous GOD will say, <HI>Amen,</HI> unto them; and you may see Things done, that when you are cool, you would have great∣ly <HI>deprecated.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Grace</HI> of <HI>Meekness,</HI> Oh!
<PB N="23" REF="001898_0023_0FB9D3D570C15A90"/>What a <HI>Golden Curb,</HI> would it keep upon us?</P>
<P N="2">II. There are some <HI>Wise Conside∣rations,</HI> with which we are to check the <HI>Follies</HI> of UNGOVERNED AN∣GER; Things which <HI>Well-Considered</HI> would lay the <HI>Easy Yoke</HI> of <HI>Meek∣ness</HI> upon us. The Truth is, <HI>Angry</HI> People, are always <HI>Inconsiderate. Anger</HI> would be mavellously allay'd, if <HI>People</HI> would but <HI>Consider</HI> a little more. But there are some <HI>Consi∣derations,</HI> which are special <HI>Anger-Quellers;</HI> They are <HI>Specificks</HI> for the Cure of the Maladie; Singular, Adapted, Potent <HI>Febrifuges.</HI></P>
<P>First. There are some <HI>Considerati∣on</HI> purely <HI>Reasonable,</HI> which would be of some use to Allay the <HI>Irre∣gular Heats</HI> of our <HI>Anger.</HI> Indeed, <HI>Anger</HI> is frequently an <HI>Ʋnreasonable</HI> Thing. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Furor brevis est.</HI> If <HI>Reason</HI> could be restored, unto its Exercise, the <HI>Anger</HI> would be over. But let us hear what <HI>Reason</HI> says.</P>
<P>An <HI>Angry</HI> Man may do well to
<PB N="24" REF="001898_0024_0FB9D3D6A1E133D8"/><HI>Consider</HI> this; <HI>Rarely is any thing done so well in Anger, but what would have been done much Better out of it.</HI> If a Man would have any Thing done, it will sooner be done by <HI>Fair Words,</HI> for the most part, than by <HI>Fierce Ones.</HI> 'Tis said, <HI>The Words of Wise Men are heard in Quiet;</HI> Go <HI>Quietly</HI> to Work, and your <HI>Words will be heard;</HI> your Business will be most Comfortably and Effectually accom∣plished. The Best Thing will not be swallowed, where <HI>Anger</HI> has made a scalding potion of it. <HI>Calmness</HI> will fit a Man, for every Thing he has to do. A <HI>Soft Tongue,</HI> will manage a <HI>Man of Bone;</HI> a Man as hard and stiff as a <HI>Bone.</HI></P>
<P>I would Especially enter this Caveat, against the Infliction of a <HI>Punishment</HI> upon Faulty <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> while the Fit of <HI>Anger</HI> is yet burning in the Hearts of their Superiours. I would Entreat you, <HI>O Superiours offended at a Fault;</HI> Stay a little; Stop a little; Don't <HI>Punish</HI> till the Chafe of your <HI>Anger</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="001898_0025_0FB9D3D7F78322C8"/>is a little over. He was a <HI>Prudent</HI> Man, though a <HI>Pagan,</HI> who said unto his Man that Vexed him; <HI>I would strike thee now, but only that I am angry with thee.</HI> Some will say, <HI>But if I put off the Execution of my Discipline, till the Heat of my Anger is over, I can't find! in my Heart then at all to Execute it.</HI> Then I say, Thou art a <HI>Fool;</HI> And it is the Wrath of Heaven against thy poor <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> that has put them into the Hands of such a <HI>Fool!</HI> I do particularly move it for the <HI>School,</HI> as well as for the House. Because the <HI>Strokes</HI> ought not furious∣ly to be thrown away; They should be reserved, either for <HI>Greater Faults,</HI> or for <HI>Obstinacy</HI> in <HI>Lesser Ones.</HI> But the <HI>Strokes</HI> ought always to be ac∣companied with a serious Discourse unto the Sufferer, showing him, the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD, that has been sinn'd against; Showing him the <HI>Sin</HI> that is now suffered for.</P>
<P>There is a Word, which Oh! That it were more thought upon!
<PB N="26" REF="001898_0026_0FB9D3D973CFB3D0"/>That word; Jam. 1.20. <HI>The Wrath of Men Works not the Righteousness of GOD!</HI> Things done <HI>Wrathfully,</HI> how seldom are they done <HI>Righ∣teously!</HI> How seldom done, as GOD would have them to be?</P>
<P>Again; An <HI>Angry</HI> Man will do well to <HI>Consider</HI> this; <HI>What are they that have incurred, my Anger; and what was it they intended, when they did it?</HI> Upon the <HI>Quality</HI> of them, with whom we are <HI>Angry,</HI> methinks the Reflections of <HI>Seneca,</HI> have some∣thing in them, <Q>Is it a <HI>Good Man</HI> that has <HI>Injured</HI> thee? Don't rea∣dily believe it. Is it a <HI>Bad Man?</HI> Don't at all Wonder at it. For to strive with thy <HI>Equals;</HI> This is <HI>Doubtful:</HI> with thy <HI>Superiors;</HI> it will be <HI>madness;</HI> with thy <HI>Inferiors;</HI> it will be <HI>Sordid.</HI> He that has <HI>Anger'd</HI> thee, is either a <HI>Stronger</HI> than thou, or a <HI>Weaker;</HI> If a <HI>Stronger,</HI> spare thy self; If a <HI>Wea∣ker</HI> spare him.</Q> O Celebrated <HI>Stoick,</HI> Thou arguest incomparably. And thus we may carry on the
<PB N="27" REF="001898_0027_0FB9D3E160A6DB30"/>Argument. The <HI>Person</HI> against whom your <HI>Anger</HI> is Enkindled; either he had <HI>no Design</HI> to <HI>Anger you;</HI> and then you wrong him in being <HI>Angry</HI> at him; or else he had a <HI>Design</HI> to <HI>Anger</HI> you; and then 'tis a silly Thing in you to gratify him so far as to be <HI>Angry</HI> at him.</P>
<P>There is a weight in such <HI>Consi∣derations.</HI> But after all, Very Nota∣ble was the Complaint of the most Learned Roman; That the <HI>Pre∣cepts</HI> of their <HI>Philosophy</HI> were very Fine Things; and yet whatever the matter were, he knew not; when they came to be <HI>Practised,</HI> they still fail'd of procuring what they pretended for.</P>
<P>We must then betake our selves unto <HI>Christianity,</HI> for higher <HI>Consi∣derations</HI> to suppress the <HI>Rebellion,</HI> which UNGOVERNED ANGER will fall into.</P>
<P>Secondly. Let us then Repair to <HI>Religious Considerations,</HI> which also are of all, the most <HI>Reasonable;</HI> and by them let the <HI>Ʋnholy Fire</HI> of
<PB N="28" REF="001898_0028_0FB9D3E365DFE858"/><HI>Anger</HI> be Extinguished. RELIGI∣ON is the Engine, that must be brought and wrought, for the put∣ting out of the <HI>Fire,</HI> which threa∣tens unknown Confusion unto us.</P>
<P>Accordingly; First; It may check our <HI>Anger,</HI> if we will <HI>Consider</HI> this; <HI>Whose Eye is upon me when I am Angry, and upon all the motions of my Anger!</HI> Syrs, Are you not always in a <HI>Presence</HI> which you owe a Respect unto? I'l propound this. The <HI>An∣gels</HI> of our GOD; These have their Eye upon us; They Rejoyce, when they see us behave our selves, as becomes the <HI>Heirs of Salvation;</HI> They do not so, when we misbe∣have our selves. It was urged a∣gainst <HI>Rashness;</HI> Eccl. V. 6. <HI>Nei∣ther say thou before the Angel, it was an Error.</HI> It may be urged against <HI>Anger,</HI> which very seldom is with∣out some <HI>Rashness</HI> in it; <HI>Why should an Angel see thee in an Error?</HI> When an <HI>Angel</HI> stood in the way of the <HI>Angry</HI> Prophet, he would rush no
<PB N="29" REF="001898_0029_0FB9D3E4C7FC5F60"/>further in his <HI>Anger.</HI> My Friend, In thy <HI>Anger</HI> thou art rushing out of the way. But, <HI>what if</HI> there should be an <HI>Angel</HI> standing by thee, with a <HI>Flaming Sword</HI> in his hand? Oh! put up the <HI>Sword</HI> of the <HI>Flam∣ing Wrath,</HI> and be n't so <HI>Angry</HI> lest <HI>he</HI> take notice of it. But there is a more <HI>considerable</HI> thing than this; and a thing so certain, that there is no room for a <HI>What if?</HI> upon it. Ah, <HI>Vexed Parence, Wilt thou not Endure, seeing Him that is Invisible?</HI> Syrs, Remember, The Eye of the great GOD Himself is upon you; A <HI>Presence,</HI> which Certainly you owe Respect unto! 'Tis very Ill manners to <HI>Chide,</HI> and <HI>Scold,</HI> and <HI>Brawl,</HI> and much more to <HI>Smite</HI> with <HI>Anger,</HI> in the Company of <HI>Stran∣gers,</HI> and much more of our <HI>Bet∣ters;</HI> 'Tis an Affront unto the Company. When you are <HI>Angry,</HI> then call to mind, <HI>I am in the Pre∣sence of the glorious GOD; The glo∣rious GOD looks upon me!</HI> Surely, This will bring you to some <HI>Deco∣rum.</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="001898_0030_0FB9D3E62E0C0278"/>If a <HI>Magistrate,</HI> or but a <HI>Constable,</HI> or indeed any Person of <HI>Gravity</HI> comes in, with a, <HI>What's to do here?</HI>—it uses to quiet <HI>unruly Fellows.</HI> And will it not quiet our <HI>unruly Angers,</HI> for the Almighty GOD Himself to come in upon them! It was said; Jer. V. 22. <HI>Fear ye not me? Saith the Lord: Will not ye Tremble at my Presence? Which have placed the Sand for the Bound of the Sea; that though the waves thereof toss themselves, they cannot prevail; though they rore, yet they cannot pass over it.</HI> Oh! could we set our selves as in the <HI>Presence</HI> of the Lord, One would think, This might set a Bound unto the foaming Sea of our <HI>Anger!</HI> To <HI>Strike</HI> in the <HI>Presence</HI> of the King; How Intolerable! How Inexcusa∣ble! A whole People once, were in such a Temper of <HI>Anger,</HI> that they were going to stone the best Friends they had in the World; The <HI>Rage reached up to Heaven!</HI> But we read, <HI>The Glory of the Lord appear'd,</HI>—
<PB N="31" REF="001898_0031_0FB9D3EDB02BB210"/>And then all the murmur of the <HI>Raging waves of the Sea</HI> — stop'd at once. Truly, When we are <HI>Angry,</HI> may the <HI>glorious Lord appear</HI> unto us, it would <HI>Calm</HI> us won∣derfully!</P>
<P>Secondly. It may check our <HI>An∣ger,</HI> if we will <HI>Consider</HI> this; <HI>Who is it that makes me Angry, and from whose Hand come the Accidents, on which I place my Anger?</HI> 'Tis very probable, There may be the <HI>Hand of Joab</HI> in all this; I mean, That there may be an <HI>Hand of Satan</HI> in Contriving to make you <HI>Angry;</HI> For he knows, That when you are <HI>Angry,</HI> he has you, at wondrous Disadvantages, to drive you into some <HI>Snare</HI> that he has been laying for you. When we are <HI>Angry,</HI> let us call to mind; <HI>It may be, that I am now put into this Agitation, by Satan sisting of me! But now let me not Hamour Satan, by discovering abundance of Bran in the sifting.</HI> What says the Proverb of <HI>Israel?
<PB N="32" REF="001898_0032_0FB9D3EE79175F28"/>He that hath no Rule over his own Spirit, is like a City that is broken down, and without Walls?</HI> We are besieged by the Devil, in the As∣saults, that alarm our <HI>Anger.</HI> If now we are <HI>like a City that is broken down, and without Walls,</HI> what, what will become of us? There was a Wicked Man among the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> by whom our Apostle was <HI>buffeted,</HI> as <HI>Micajah</HI> had formerly been, af∣ter a most Intimate Communion with the Heavenly World. But the Man of GOD says of him; 2 Cor. XII. 7. <HI>There was given me a Messenger of Satan, to buffet me, lest I should be Exalted above measure.</HI> Syrs, The Cause why you are so <HI>Angry,</HI> is Because that somebody <HI>Buffets</HI> you. Now think; <HI>It may be, that Satan sets them on!</HI> And he may set them on for this very purpose; To throw you into the Disorders of <HI>Anger.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! <HI>Be not Ignorant of his Devi∣ces!</HI> —But I am certain, There is a more <HI>Considerable</HI> Hand than <HI>Sa∣tans,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="001898_0033_0FB9D3F00053B998"/>without which no Trouble∣some Occurrent whatsoever could accost you. Whatever the <HI>Man</HI> be that offends you he is but an <HI>Instrument</HI> in the Hand of GOD; The great GOD is the Eternal, Sovereign, <HI>First Cause</HI> of all; and you may say unto that Man, <HI>Thou couldest have no Power against me, except it were given thee from Above.</HI> Oh! That our <HI>Anger</HI> might learn that Language; Psal. XXXIX. 9. <HI>I'm Dumb, I open not my mouth; For tis what thou hast done,</HI> O Lord. A <HI>Job</HI> will not be Intemperately <HI>Angry</HI> at a <HI>Caldaean,</HI> when he Re∣members, <HI>'Tis the Lord, who has taken away.</HI> A <HI>David</HI> will not be Intemperately <HI>Angry</HI> at a <HI>Shimei,</HI> when he Remembers, <HI>The Lord has bidden him.</HI> Child of GOD, I hope, thou canst say, <HI>I can take any thing well at my Fathers Hands!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. Excellent <HI>Examples</HI> of a WELL-GOVERNED ANGER well <HI>considered</HI> with us, may be of
<PB N="34" REF="001898_0034_0FB9D3F1747AF790"/>use to save us from the <HI>Follies</HI> of UNGOVERNED A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>EP. B<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight <HI>Examples</HI> of <HI>Meekness</HI> have been set before us; Let us <HI>observe</HI> the Examples, till we can <HI>Follow</HI> them. Shall I tell you of a famous Divine, who while an Insolent Man, had struck out some of his Teeth, only and calmly said unto him, <HI>I could bear you to strike out all the rest, if I might be so Happy as to do your Soul any Good!</HI> Shall I tell you, of another famous Divine, who having a Stone by a Base Woman thrown at him, as he was ignominiously carried through the City, took no notice of it, but only and calmly said, <HI>The Good GOD forgive thee!</HI> Shall I tell you of a <HI>Calvin,</HI> who is famous for that Speech of his; <HI>Though</HI> Luther <HI>should call me a De∣vil, I will call him no other than an Eminent Servant of the Lord!</HI> Or, will you be told of a Renowned <HI>Moses,</HI> who in <HI>Meekness</HI> out-shone all of these, and who was <HI>made Great by the Gentleness of GOD?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="001898_0035_0FB9D3F8EC1E76D0"/>
But after all, I will rather say <HI>Run with Patience, looking off unto JE∣SƲS,;</HI> A JESUS, <HI>Fairer than the Children of Men!</HI> An Eminent Per∣son wrote on the Walls of his Stu∣dy, those words of our Incompara∣ble SAVIOUR; LEARN OF ME, FOR I AM MEEK AND LOW∣LY IN HEART. I have read of some, that when the Rage of <HI>An∣ger</HI> was upon them, they would set before them a <HI>Lamb,</HI> which would bring all to rights. But this is the Thing, that is now pressed for; O <HI>Angry</HI> People, Set before your selves the JESUS, who is the <HI>Lamb of GOD,</HI> and who was always <HI>as Meek as a Lamb;</HI> and who when <HI>he was oppressed, and was afflicted, yet opened not his mouth; as a Sheep before the Shearers is dumb, so he opened not His mouth.</HI> We are so instructed, 1 Pet. II. 21, 23. <HI>CHRIST Suffered for us, leaving us an Example, that ye should follow His Steps; Who, when He was Reviled, Reviled not again.</HI> Truly, Never,
<PB N="36" REF="001898_0036_0FB9D3F9C03E58F0"/>Never was there such a Pattern of <HI>Meekness,</HI> as our most amiable and admirable JESUS. I beseech you, let us have that <HI>Pattern</HI> al∣ways before us, and <HI>set the Lord always before us!</HI> Church-History mentions a Man of Great Figure who had been a very <HI>Passionate</HI> Man, and a Man of such violent <HI>Anger,</HI> that he made himself un∣easy to all the World: But all the World at length took notice, that he became one of the <HI>Meekest</HI> Men upon Earth: and when some asked him, what it was that had produced this change upon him; he replied, <HI>I am come to this, by keeping my Thoughts very much on the Meekness of my Lovely SAVIOƲR.</HI> Syrs, when you feel the <HI>Fiery Ser∣pent</HI> of <HI>Anger</HI> fastning on you, fix your Eye on your Lovely SAVI∣OUR. 'Twill have a Transfor∣ming Efficacy.</P>
<P>Our SAVIOUR who is <HI>God-Man,</HI> anon carries us up into the
<PB N="37" REF="001898_0037_0FB9D3FB4A94A610"/>Infinite GOD; A GOD in whom, Oh! what an Example of <HI>Long-Suffering</HI> have we to be amazed at! A GOD, in whom these Two Things are celebrated; Psam. GIII. 8, 9. <HI>He is slow to Anger,</HI> and <HI>He will not always chide.</HI> Alas, How many Millions of Indigni∣ties are put upon the Omnipotent GOD, and this every Day! The Psalmist says, <HI>He is provoked every Day.</HI> We may wonder that He has not Long ago made this whole World an entire <HI>Sodom,</HI> and laid it in Ashes! A World, that is sill'd with His <HI>Adversaries.</HI> 'Twere an easy Thing, and no unjust one, for Him to dart hot Thunderbolts down upon the Heads of all His <HI>Adversaries.</HI> But He <HI>Suffers their Manners.</HI> He bestows—Thousands of Mercies and Comforts on them from Day to Day. A <HI>Patient</HI> GOD now says to an <HI>Angry</HI> Man, <HI>Dost thou well to be what thou art?</HI> Oh! Let us Imitate the <HI>Long-Suffering</HI> of our Heavenly Father. Especially,
<PB N="38" REF="001898_0038_0FB9D3FCAE330E90"/>when we think, what <HI>Experience</HI> of His <HI>Long-Suffering,</HI> we our selves have had, in His Dealings with us!</P>
<P>Fourthly. Will this do nothing to <HI>Govern</HI> our <HI>Anger?</HI> Impartially <HI>Consiter, What our Anger is;</HI> and <HI>What we are in our Anger;</HI> and <HI>What we do by our Anger?</HI></P>
<P>If you take a View of <HI>Excessive Anger,</HI> will it not appear an Odious, an Unhandsome, a Deformed sort of a Thing? Some of the Ancients advised an <HI>Angry</HI> Man, to take a View of his own <HI>Face</HI> in a <HI>Glass.</HI> Look in a <HI>Glass,</HI> my Friend, and see, and say, How it looks to have so much of <HI>Cain</HI> in the Counte∣nance! Methinks, The View may turn the <HI>Anger</HI> into <HI>Blushing,</HI> and make thee more <HI>Angry</HI> at thy self, than at any One else. <HI>Turpis As∣pectus; Quid Animus?</HI> If <HI>Anger</HI> in the <HI>Face</HI> be so ugly, what is it in the <HI>Soul?</HI> 'Tis a very Good Rule in Conversation; For a Man to Mind how his own <HI>Indecencies</HI> look, when
<PB N="39" REF="001898_0039_0FB9D403941F4E60"/>he sees them in other Men. Why, That Outrageous <HI>Anger,</HI> in which thou dost indulge thy self, how dost thou like it in other Men, when thou seest them storming with such Outrages?</P>
<P>But more than so; O UNGO∣VERNED ANGER, From thee we suffer <HI>great Disquietments,</HI> and very Hurtful Things are done un∣to us, by thy <HI>Praecipitancies!</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Anger;</HI> Alas, it unfits a Man for every Thing in the World. It mingles a <HI>strange Fire</HI> with our <HI>Sacrifices.</HI> Our <HI>Devotions</HI> are all Spoilt, if they be not <HI>with∣out VVrath.</HI> If we cannot <HI>Bear much,</HI> we shall never be <HI>Pillars in the House of GOD,</HI> nor be very use∣ful in any <HI>Society</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Blemish</HI> unto a Man; it lays him low, in the esteem of the Neighbourhood. An <HI>Angry</HI> Man may keep the Neighbours in some Awe; But little doth the think, their <HI>Secret A∣version</HI> for him; and how much
<PB N="40" REF="001898_0040_0FB9D40676E3AE78"/>they bear in mind, his Abusive usage of them. Such <HI>Anger,</HI> it makes a Man unfit for any <HI>Rela∣tion.</HI> Art thou a <HI>Froward</HI> and a <HI>Furious</HI> Man? The Bible forbids us to enter into a Close <HI>Friendship</HI> with such a Man. If thou art not so much as fit for a <HI>Friend,</HI> what else canst thou be good for? Such a Man is a meer <HI>Nabal,</HI> to all that are about him.</P>
<P>Yea, <HI>Anger</HI> may cause a Man to fall under <HI>Anger.</HI> Thy <HI>Anger,</HI> O Man, may lay thee open to the <HI>Anger</HI> of GOD. When <HI>Moses</HI> was <HI>Angry,</HI> he broke both of the Two Tables, on which the <HI>Law</HI> was written by the <HI>Finger of GOD.</HI> In∣deed, an <HI>Angry</HI> Man will soon break <HI>both Tables</HI> of the Law; Yea, He will <HI>Abound in Transgression.</HI> And GOD will <HI>Distribute Sorrows in His Anger,</HI> to the Transgressor. Some∣times the <HI>Anger</HI> of People, will boil out in such <HI>VVishes,</HI>—as the <HI>Anger</HI> of GOD will bring about, in
<PB N="41" REF="001898_0041_0FB9D40746CEB4D0"/>astonishing <HI>Mischiefs</HI> upon them. Whether it be so or no; our glo∣rious JUDGE, has given us an awful Intimation, That our <HI>Anger</HI> has nothing less than <HI>Murder</HI> in it! — O Dreadful; — Nothing less than <HI>Murder</HI> in it! He says, Mar. V. 22. <HI>Whosoever is Angry with his Brother without a Cause, shall be in danger of the Judgment; and, whoso∣ever shall say to his Brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the Council; But, whosoever shall say, Thou Fool, shall be in danger of Hell-fire. An∣ger Conceived</HI> is like the Crimes, which fell under the Cognizance of the middle Judicatory of the Twenty three Judges among the <HI>Jews. Anger Ʋttered,</HI> is like the Crimes of which the Highest Judi∣catory of the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> and <HI>Se∣venty</HI> among them took the Cog∣nizance 'Tis like a <HI>Capital Crime;</HI> The Commandment which forbids <HI>Murder</HI> is that which has forbid∣den it. <HI>Anger</HI> soon gets on to <HI>Hatred; Hatred</HI> what is it but <HI>Mur∣der?</HI>
<PB N="42" REF="001898_0042_0FB9D408ADF620E8"/>And verily, 'Tis to be won∣dred at, that <HI>Angry</HI> People com∣mit no more actual <HI>Murders</HI> than they do! There is much of <HI>Hell</HI> in it; and <HI>Hell</HI> will be the Punish∣ment. This is very sure; By this <HI>Anger</HI> of ours, we shall <HI>grieve</HI> the <HI>Dove-like Spirit</HI> of our SAVIOUR, Exceedingly. Those Two Things are joined; Eph. IV. 30, 31. <HI>Grieve not the Holy Spirit of GOD; let all Bitterness, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, be put away from you.</HI> But, will you <HI>Grieve</HI> that <HI>Spirit of Goodness?</HI> Oh! How <HI>Evil,</HI> How <HI>E∣vil,</HI> will be the Consequences! Christian, 'Tis thy <HI>Glory</HI> to be a <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD. When thou per∣ceivest <HI>Anger</HI> glowing in thy Soul, now think; <HI>What? shall I set a Temple of GOD on Fire? Should a Temple of GOD, have such a Fire preying upon it!</HI></P>
<P>And now, What shall be the Issue of all the Meditations.</P>
<P>May we from this Time, One
<PB N="43" REF="001898_0043_0FB9D4109B680590"/>and all, Study that <HI>Meekness,</HI> which is a <HI>Thing of great Price in the sight of GOD!</HI> Oh! may the Ef∣fect of our Meditations and Sup∣plications be this; That we shall be the <HI>Meek,</HI> whom the Gospel has pronounced the <HI>Blessed</HI> Ones, and of whom it is promised, That they shall be <HI>Beautified</HI> with the <HI>Salvation</HI> of GOD. Concerning a Continual Study to suppress UN∣GOVERNED ANGER, I will say unto you, what was of old spoken to one who was disswaded from it; 1 Sam. XXV. 31. <HI>This shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of Heart;</HI> It will not be <HI>Repented</HI> of! I speak this, the more Sollicitously, because the Time is coming on for the Accomplishment of that Prophecy, <HI>The Nations were Angry.</HI> The <HI>Anger</HI> of People against one ano∣ther, is like to make fearful Tra∣gedies. At this Time, <HI>O seek Meek∣ness, that ye may be hid in the Day of the Anger of the Lord;</HI> And that ye may admit no <HI>Wrath,</HI> but
<PB N="44" REF="001898_0044_0FB9D411DB8699B0"/>what shall <HI>praise the Lord,</HI> and the <HI>Remainder of the Wrath,</HI> you may still <HI>Restrain.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Above others,</HI> it is the spe∣cial Concern of Persons in <HI>Superiour Stations,</HI> to be on their Guard, lest UNGOVERNED ANGER get the upper hand of them; lest they who are to <HI>Govern</HI> others be themselves <HI>Geverned</HI> by the worst of Leaders. Truly, a <HI>Little</HI> of this <HI>Folly,</HI> will be an unknown Damage, to a Man of <HI>Reputation.</HI></P>
<P>Syrs, If you are Men in Publick. Circumstances, and especially, if you are Men of Projection to <HI>Do Good</HI> in the World; You will have your Conduct often blamed with Vile <HI>Misrepresentations</HI> of it. You must meet with many Prodigies of <HI>In∣gratitude,</HI> and People will heap <HI>Injuries</HI> upon you, at the very time when you are heaping of <HI>Kindnesses</HI> upon them. You shall perhaps encounter with unaccounta∣ble
<PB N="45" REF="001898_0045_0FB9D41343FFF4D0"/>Defamations, and in every cor∣ner of the Country <HI>hear the Defa∣ming of many</HI> in wretched Calum∣nies, invented and fomented by them that <HI>Love and make a Lye.</HI>— But now,—<HI>Oh! Take heed unto your Spirit.</HI> Not a Word! Not so much as a Word, but what shall become a Meek Servant of GOD! Only say, <HI>Lord, Put not thy Servant away in Anger, and let me not have the mark of one put away, by Anger gain∣ing upon me!</HI> Even a <HI>Moses</HI> himself, by <HI>Speaking unadvisedly with his Lips</HI> on such <HI>Provocations,</HI> may incur this; <HI>GOD shall be Wroth with him!</HI>— Oh! That <HI>Great Men</HI> were <HI>always Wise!</HI> But, alas. They are not so.</P>
<P>A Miserable Man here in the Chains of <HI>Death</HI> before you, Ear∣nestly desires it of me, That all People may be warned against UN∣GOVERNED ANGER, from the sad Experience of what he has him∣self therein been left unto. Yea, The Holy GOD shews him unto
<PB N="46" REF="001898_0046_0FB9D414B3720370"/>the Congregation, and says unto us, <HI>Govern your Anger, or, little do you think, what it may bring you to!</HI></P>
<P>Our Charitable desires at the same time, for this Miserable Man, what can they be?—But that a Gracious GOD would affect his Heart, with a sense, not only of the <HI>Follies</HI> he has by his UNGO∣VERNED ANGER been so often betray'd into; <HI>Follies</HI> that have En∣kindled against him the <HI>Anger</HI> of GOD; Especially that Crime of <HI>Killing</HI> one whom he ought to have <HI>Loved,</HI> for which he must now <HI>hasten to the Pit;</HI> but also make him truly sensible of all the <HI>Sin</HI> which hath so incensed Heaven, that hav∣ing reached unto but about Three or Four and Thirty years of Age, he must be <HI>Cut off,</HI> and come to a <HI>fearful End:</HI> That all the <HI>Sin</HI> where∣in he has <HI>denied the GOD that is Above,</HI> may appear unto him, as it is, the most <HI>Odious Evil</HI> in the World; That a CHRIST, the on∣ly
<PB N="47" REF="001898_0047_0FB9D41C2CFC47F8"/>SAVIOUR from <HI>Sin,</HI> may ap∣pear inexpressibly <HI>Precious</HI> unto him, and <HI>fulfil</HI> on him and for him, <HI>all the Good Pleasure of his Goodness;</HI> And, that having made the Flight of a lively <HI>Faith</HI> unto the <HI>Blood which cleanses from all Sin,</HI> he may feel his Heart at the same time filled with the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD and of His <HI>Neighbour,</HI> and a Concern to <HI>do all the Good</HI> that he can at his leaving of the World. Ah! Poor FEN∣WICK, in pursuance of this Prae∣paration for thy approaching <HI>Death,</HI> now the <HI>Sorrows of Death compass thee, and the Pains of Hell get hold on thee,</HI> 'tis high time for thee to <HI>call upon the Name of the Lord, and say, O Lord, I beseech thee, Deliver my Soul!</HI></P>
<P>Oh! See to it, that the Work of <HI>Repentance,</HI> which now seems to be hopefully beginning upon you, prove a <HI>Sincere,</HI> and a <HI>Real,</HI> and a <HI>Thorough</HI> Work, and an <HI>Hope that will not make ashamed.</HI> The rather,
<PB N="48" REF="001898_0048_0FB9D41D8BAEB900"/>Because a work of <HI>Repentance</HI> in Circumstances like to yours, will have many things to bring a sus∣picion upon the <HI>Sincerity</HI> of it. They that never <HI>Seek</HI> to GOD, until they feel Him <HI>Slaying</HI> of them, do usually <HI>flatter Him with their mouth,</HI> and <HI>Lye to him with their Tongue.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chains</HI> of an <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Mind,</HI> those hideous <HI>Chains of Darkness,</HI> are with much <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Difficulty got∣ten off, than the <HI>Chains of Iron,</HI> which you have now upon your Body. Oh! Cry to your SAVI∣OUR, with a wonderful Agony, to take them off! If you do so, then, Ah! Poor FENWICK Re∣turning to GOD, In the Words of the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> there comes that Message from GOD unto thee; Jer. III. 12. <HI>Return, saith the Lord, and I will not Cause my Anger to fall upon you; For I am Merciful, saith the Lord, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not keep Anger for ever <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI>
<PB N="49" REF="001898_0049_0FB9D41E92A22C10"/>a Sinner as Thou art, <HI>Repenting,</HI> —There will be <HI>Joy in Heaven over thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Surely, I have heard this Man bemoaning himself,</HI> That formerly instead of <HI>Repenting,</HI> when a Gra∣cious GOD gave him a <HI>Space to Repent,</HI> he misapplied the <HI>Space,</HI> to add unto the <HI>Heap</HI> of his many Impieties. But, Oh! may he now <HI>Repent,</HI> and produce a <HI>Joy,</HI> not only <HI>in Heaven,</HI> but also among all the People of GOD, that are looking up to <HI>Heaven</HI> for him!</P>

<HEAD>THE Dying Speech OF <HI>Jeremiah Fenwick,</HI></HEAD>
<P>Who, after he had at the place of Execution, less audibly spoken the substance of these Things, then gave the ensuing Instrument as a more full Declaration of his <HI>Dying Sentiments.</HI></P>
<P>I Consider my self as a dying, Man, and I desire to dye giving Glory to God, before whom I am now to make my Appearance. I offer up my Praises unto God who has granted me such a space of Repentance, and so many helps and means to bring me to it</P>
<P>I hope, the Faithful Servants of God, will with some comfort see
<PB N="2" REF="001898_0051_0FB9D426B77670C8"/>some Harvest of the great pains they have taken for my Good.</P>
<P>To all the other Sins of a Wicked Life, I have added this; That I have too much delayed my Repentance, even since my Imprisonment, while the Sentence against my evil work, was not yet certain to be Executed. Though I have hereby so affronted and provoked the good Spirit of Grace, that He might justly with∣draw for ever from me, yet such has been his Free and Rich Grace, as to continue still to visit me with his In∣fluences; and bring on a work of Repentance in my Soul.</P>
<P>I heartily mourn for all the Sins of my Life; and above all for the Fountain of all Sins, which I have in an Heart that is desperately wick∣ed. I most particularly confess and bewail my Blood Guiltiness. I owe my Life to Justice, for having wrong∣fully taken away the Life of my Bro∣ther, whom I ought to have loved as my self. I own the Justice of the Government in their Proceeding a∣gainst me. <HI>But, Lord, there is For∣giveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</HI></P>
<P><PB REF="001898_0052_0FB9D429CCFF4158"/>
I behold the Infinite Mercy of a God ready to Pardon; and my Soul is amazed at it. I behold a great Saviour, shedding his Blood, which cleanses from all Sin. And I hear him saying to the chief of Sinners, <HI>Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.</HI> With a distressed Soul I fly to him, to be reconciled unto God, and to be led into Paths of Righte∣ousness. I am not without Hope. And one fruit of my Hope, is, that it causes me to look on my Sins with more Sorrow for them, and Hatred of them; which till I had this Hope, I did not care or dare to think upon. Another fruit of it, is, that my Heart is melted, and filled with Desires to Glorify God.</P>
<P>And I know not how to glorify God more, than by solemn warnings unto all People to take heed of such Sins, as have brought me to such a Ruin as is now come upon me.</P>
<P>The first thing that lies heavy on my Heart is, My Prophanation of the Lords Day, and my frequently &amp; needlesly neglecting the Publick Wor∣ship of God. A Sin, which let all that love their Souls be afraid of.
<PB REF="001898_0053_0FB9D42C65940E60"/>I have wounded my Soul sometimes by excessive Drinking. A Sin that leads to many others I have been very vile in Swearing and Cursing. <HI>Lord, send me not among those whose Language I have been used unto!</HI> Un∣governed Anger has brought my Death. Beware, my Friends, of this deadly Evil. But I would especially bewail my Prayerless Life. I had no Prayers with my Family, nor in my Retirement, in the Morning of the Day, when I was lest unto the Mur∣ther of my Neighbour. O my Friends, In the Day, which you don't begin with Prayers unto God, little do you know what God may leave you to.</P>
<P>Thus, I would as in the Presence of God, and as I am now in a short Time to appear before my great Judge, there to give up an Account of my Actions done in the Flesh, solemnly exhort and warn all that shall see or hear of my Tragical and Untimely End; But more particular∣ly Masters of Families, that they do not neglect Prayers in their Families, and a due Attendance on the Publick Worship of God, on his Holy Day,
<PB REF="001898_0054_0FB9D42D8DCA9038"/>and all other Duties required in Gods Holy Word, as I to my great Grief have done. I desire all, that they look back on their past life, and seek to God, thorough Jesus Christ for Repentance, while there is a space given to them, least they mourn at last, and say, <HI>how have I hated In∣struction?</HI> and least God in His Holy Justice should say to them, <HI>when I called upon you, you would not hear, now you cry to me, I will not answer you.</HI> I desire yet more especially, to warn all young Persons, to seek un∣to God in their Youth and in the Morning of their Days, as believing that their whole Life is but a short Time to prepare for Eternity; and to live in an holy walk with God, lest they should provoke God to leave them to fall into the same Sins which have been my Ruin. Pray, let my Advice to you never be for∣gotten by you, but take Example from <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it as the words of a dying <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Neighbour, that you may not run on in sinning a∣gainst the blessed God, but that you may take warning by me, and may hearken to the Calls of God in the
<PB REF="001898_0055_0FB9D434AF1A9BE8"/>Gospel, with a due and diligent At∣tendance on all the Ordinances of the Gospel, which is able to make you wise unto Salvation. Thus lea∣ving you to the Mercy of the great God, as I do my self likewise, I hope through the Merits of my dear Redeemer, we may have a happy Meeting in the great Day of the Lord. Take these warnings of a dying Man. And now, <HI>O Father of Mercies, Let these warnings do Good in the World, and let me who am leaving the World, find favour with thee, through the blessed Jesus, my only Saviour.</HI> Amen.</P>
