<HEAD>A LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I heard you was writing in answer to me, in the heat of your spirit, and that your papers had passed thro' Mr. Hopkins's hands, I did not expect a calm, fair, equitable examination of things, and I do not find it. 'Tis most evident that you did not write under the influence of that wisdom which is <HI>without partiality,</HI> but hearkened, a great deal too much, to the counsels of the wisdom which is of men; which has caused you to wander far out of the way of truth, equity and honor, to my injury and your own hurt.</P>
<P>I shall not point out and reprove all your faults in what you have written against me: that would swell this letter into a large volume: but some things I must tell you. <HI>If thy brother trespass against thee, tell him his fault.</HI>—A few things only, I briefly mention in the first part, and hasten to your appendix.</P>
<P>You say (p. 19)
<Q>Does it not deserve a smile to see Mr. H. quoting President Edwards's answer to Taylor, in confutation of my opinion?—He is so fully of my sentiments on this head, that I am <HI>bold</HI> to say, Mr. H. never read him, or does not under∣stand him, or else <HI>injured his conscience in quoting him.</HI></Q>
Neither of these is true, Doctor. I read that book many years since, and have now in my possession a manuscript, wrote A.D. 1762, in which I observe some of that great man's doctrinal inconsistencies, and shew the falshood and absurdity of his notion of personal identity, and of Adam and all his children being one <HI>complex moral person</HI> or <HI>moral whole.</HI> If you are disposed to publish it, it is at your service. It will enable you to judge whether I understand the book; and
<PB N="4" REF="012066_0003_0F899389334215E8"/>
perhaps may give you a clearer understanding of it—As to inju∣ring my conscience in quoting him, this is a wonderful thought, Doctor I quoted these words from you,
<Q>This contrariety to God is <HI>innate</HI> and <HI>interwoven</HI> with the very frame of our hearts.</Q>
and then added, 'Is this consistent with Mr. Edwards's doctrine? He says,
<Q>There is not the least need of supposing any evil quality <HI>infused, implanted</HI> or <HI>wro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t into the nature</HI> of man, by any positive cause or influence whatever; or of supposing that man is conceived and born with a <HI>fountain of evil in his heart,</HI> such as is any thing properly <HI>positive,</HI> in order to account for a sinful corruption of nature.</Q>
See the Dialogue, p 15. I did not add one word more. In what was my conscience injured in this? Was it in asking that wicked question? or in quoting the words? Are the words, or the doctrine they contain, wicked, and un∣lawful to be transcribed? I believe, Doctor, all the fault lies in the direct opposition of Mr. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s doctrine, contained in these words, to yours, and this, you know, is not my fault, but yours, or his.</P>
<P>Speaking of the perverse Jews, you say,
<Q>It was as difficult to persuade them that they hated God, and were the children of Satan, as it is to persuade Mr. H that carnal men naturally hate moral good, and <HI>perhaps for the same reason.</HI> When Christ told them they were the children of the devil, they in return, told him he had a devil; pretty much as Mr. H. has served me for saying, <HI>man is turned devil.</HI></Q>
(p 25). 'Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you, Sir, that intimate concerning me, that I have a devil; I bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t no such 'railing ac∣cusation' against you. I mention this as one of the things by which you dishonor yourself, both as a gentleman and a christian, and of which you ought seriously to repent.</P>
<P>You say, in your sermon (p 40.41, 2d edit.)
<Q>Sinners laugh at his (God's) counsels and despise all his reproof; and <HI>so they will do</HI> till the arm of God's power is revealed to make them willing [by creating them anew in Christ Jesus]</Q>
I compared this with another passage in your sermon, viz
<Q>No moral argu∣ments <HI>except</HI> the terrors of the Lord, are adapted to influence carnal sinners to attend to their salvation,</Q>
and observed the inconsistence. You now endeavor to reconcile yourself with yourself thus,
<Q>Where is the inconsistency? In both I shew that no arguments of <HI>any hind</HI> are sufficient to renew and reconcile carnal sinners to God. Yet I say, the terrors of the Lord are adapted to influence them to seek deliverance from hell by working on their principle of self love—Is this hard to be un∣derstood?</Q>
<PB N="5" REF="012066_0003_0F899389334215E8"/>
No, Doctor, it is not. But it is hard to be under∣stood how these terrors should thus work on this principle, so long as the sinner laughs at and despises them. You had better have said nothing. You must give up one of the propositions: they will always quarrel.</P>
<P>You say (p. 46 of your serm.)
<Q>A realizing view and percep∣tion of the <HI>moral</HI> beauty and glory of God is that which is the motive that first prevails with the [<HI>renewed</HI>] sinner to <HI>return</HI> and be <HI>reconciled</HI> to him.</Q>
In the note you say,
<Q>I ask Mr. H's pardon for leaving out the word [<HI>renewed</HI>] which I have now inserted.</Q>
You, Sir, had more need to ask pardon for inserting it now; which, had you done so, I could not have granted, but upon the condition of your throwing it out again. The propo∣sition, as it stood before was true, and as such I quoted it to your honor; but as it now stands, it is foolish and absurd, and a mon∣ster which devours itself. The <HI>true</HI> and <HI>scriptural</HI> idea of a sin∣ner <HI>renewed,</HI> is one morally changed, and conformed to God in the holiness of his heart or prevailing temper. And thus you sometimes describe this renewal; I don't mean exactly in these words, but to the same sense. And yet you here represent this renewal as affecting <HI>no such change.</HI> The renewed sinner, consi∣dered <HI>simply as renewed,</HI> is not yet persuaded
<Q>to return and be reconciled to God.</Q>
This is effected by a different, and after∣work of the Spirit of God, giving the renewed sinner 'a realizing view,' and so the sinner is renewed, and not renewed at the same time: for such a renewal of the spirit of the mind as does not reconcile the man to God is <HI>nothing.</HI> Why, Doctor, do you so trifle with, and abuse scriptural terms &amp; phrases? I don't mention this absurdity as peculiar to you, it is common to all who teach a physical regeneration, without any influence from light and truth. But will numbers keep such absurdities in countenance?—Doc∣tor, your sermons need a third edition, with numerous additional corrections.</P>
<P>Now, Doctor, let us a little examine your Appendix. In do∣ing which we shall both have need of patience; I in suffering your unjust censures, you in suffering my just vindication and apology.</P>
<P N="1">I. The first thing I notice is your <HI>perverse</HI> misrepresentation of my doctrine relating to the <HI>moral sense</HI> or <HI>taste</HI> natural and essential to man as a moral agent, and to <HI>all</HI> moral agents, <HI>as such.</HI> You say 'Mr. Hart's—<HI>fundamental</HI> error, I take to be this,
<PB N="6" REF="012066_0004_0F89938ACF633580"/>
'viz. that all beings endowed with natural conscience have ne∣cessarily a taste for moral excellency, i. e. approve and LOVE <HI>that which appears to the understanding or conscience to be morally good, and</HI> HATE <HI>what appears morally evil.</HI>' (p. 63, 64.) Here, Doctor, you represent that approbation which <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>conscience,</HI> or the <HI>moral sense</HI> gives to actions and characters morally good, when presented to the mind in a <HI>true</HI> light (which I spake of as <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>essential</HI> to moral agents, <HI>as such</HI>) as the <HI>same</HI> with the <HI>love of the heart,</HI> or their being <HI>chosen</HI> and <HI>embraced by the will</HI> in <HI>prefe∣rence</HI> to all that stands in competition with them.—I did not do so, but kept these clearly distinguished. You might have per∣ceived it if your mind had not been <HI>biased</HI> by evil passions, unless your understanding is more defective than I have thought it.— This, Sir, is <HI>your fundamental error,</HI> or mistake and blunder, and runs thro' all you have said upon this subject, to my injury, and to your own dishonor.</P>
<P>Quoting a passage from my dialogue (p. 52) which concludes thus, 'On this,' i. e. on the moral faculty of discerning between moral good and evil, &amp;c.
<Q>is founded the principle and power of natural conscience,</Q>
you paraphrase or expound the words thus,
<Q>On this ready perception of the <HI>beauty</HI> of morally good, and <HI>hatefulness</HI> of morally evil objects, <HI>i. e.</HI> on a LOVE <HI>for holi∣ness</HI> and HATRED <HI>of sin, is founded</HI> the principle and power of natural conscience;</Q>
by which you certainly mean a <HI>gracious</HI> and <HI>holy love</HI> to spiritual things, and <HI>holy hatred</HI> of their contraries. (p. 65.) Doctor, if you thus essentially misrepresented the ob∣vious sense of my words, thro' weakness, I pity you; if you did it wilfully, which you have given great reason to suspect, the heavens frown upon you.</P>
<P>You go on in your way, and draw many dreadful consequences from your fundamental blunder, which you charge upon me, and injuriously lay them at my door; and by partial quotations, and perverse constructions endeavor to fasten them on me: see your two first sections.—You say in particular,
<Q>Mr. H. be∣lieves that unrenewed men <HI>see</HI> and LOVE virtue <HI>in its own light,</HI></Q>
(p. 70.)
<Q>He largely <HI>insists</HI> that moral beings <HI>necessarily</HI> LOVE God and objects morally good or holy <HI>as soon as they see them,</HI> and takes it for granted, again and again, that they can see them in a true light, as amiable and excellent, worthy of esteem and honor, and are <HI>affected accordingly</HI>; that they <HI>cannot hate</HI> God, but when they view him as a <HI>morally evil</HI> and <HI>contemptible</HI> being.</Q>
<PB N="7" REF="012066_0004_0F89938ACF633580"/>
(p. 163.) This, Doctor, is your short summary of what you have been laboring to persuade your readers I believe and teach, at the expence of almost an hundred pages, by a variety of partial quotations, arbitrary and artful misrepresentations, and foolish and perverse reasonings. But after all, you are only <HI>beering false witness against your neighbour,</HI> as I shall shew you presently. But first, let us see what you tell your readers I believe, relating to the <HI>nature</HI> of the <HI>enmity</HI> of vicious beings to God.</P>
<P N="2">II. I will represent the matter in your own words. You say,
<Q>He (Mr. H.) shews his opinion to be this, that all men really <HI>love</HI> God's true character, and never <HI>hate</HI> him but when he is viewed by them in false and odious colours;—and therefore that their <HI>hearts</HI> are <HI>right, holy</HI> and <HI>good,</HI></Q>
(p. 74.)
<Q>Are there not many</Q>
(beings)
<Q>who are allowed by all, except Mr. H. to be totally destitute of true virtue or love to God, even all the devils? Mr. H. indeed supposes that they do not, cannot hate God, considered in himself, but <HI>only</HI> a <HI>false</HI> character of him, which is not God.—But whatever high opinion Mr. H. may have of the piety of devils,—I shall take it for granted that devils are very wicked beings,</Q>
(p. 77.) They are indeed so, Doctor; they abode not in the truth, and they falsely accuse those that do. God forbid that we should be like them.—You say you 'could fill whole pages to shew that Mr. Hart considers this en∣mity 'to God as a <HI>very trifling</HI> evil, (93) No, Doctor, you can't produce one passage that intimates any such thing; but might have quoted many which shew the contrary.</P>
<P>Please to turn your eye on your 90, 91, 92 and 93 pag.— You will there see such an instance of unjust and infamous misre∣presentation, and ill bred perverseness as is scarcely to be equal∣led by the whole society of Jesuits. Doctor, is not this para∣graph like the young prophet's ax? I have good reason to think it is, and several others.</P>
<P>Doctor, you represent this as my doctrine,
<Q>It is not the <HI>true,</HI> but a <HI>false</HI> God, a <HI>morally evil</HI> or <HI>sinful</HI> being, that they</Q>
(wicked men)
<Q>always, <HI>universally hate,</HI> and that <HI>because</HI> he appears to them <HI>wicked,</HI> and as acting contrary to the moral law, which they naturally approve. And therefore it is <HI>impossible</HI> for them to <HI>hate</HI> the <HI>true</HI> God.—By Mr. H's own account, there is no need that the spirit of enmity should be mortified, and a better and holy temper introduced into the heart</Q>
(of the carnal men)
<Q>because the temper is <HI>already holy,</HI> and needs nothing to remove
<PB N="8" REF="012066_0005_0F89938B72E4ABD8"/>
its enmity to God, but just <HI>speculative</HI> notions of his character. This is Mr. H's notion of enmity to God, in a short view.</Q>
(p. 97.98) I could quote much more to this purpose, but these are sufficient to give the reader an idea of the doctrine you charge, and endeavor to fasten upon me.</P>
<P N="3">III. Let us now search the Dialogue that we may see whether these things are so, or are only <HI>false</HI> and <HI>railing accusations</HI> which you have bro't against your brother.—Doctor, I desire you will attend with a good and honest heart, willing to see things as they really are.—I said,
<Q>There is in man a natural faculty whereby he is rendered capable of discerning and distinguishing between moral good and evil—and readily perceives the one to be <HI>right, amiable,</HI> and <HI>worthy</HI> of <HI>esteem</HI> and <HI>honor</HI>; the other <HI>wrong, hate∣ful,</HI> and <HI>blame-worthy</HI>—as soon as these objects are seen by the mind in their <HI>true</HI> light, or as being what they really are, without any further reasoning about them,</Q>
(D p 52)— This, Doctor, you have represented as implying a <HI>holy love</HI> to the one, and hatred to the other: but suffer me to ask you a few questions. What are characters and actions morally good <HI>in themselves?</HI> Are they not <HI>really</HI> right, amiable, worthy of esteem and honor? Are not their contraries really wrong, hateful, blame-worthy? If the mind sees these objects as 'being what they are,' does she not perceive them to be so, i. e. to be what she sees them to be? And if the mind perceives the morally good to be right, &amp;c. and the morally evil to be wrong, &amp;c. does she not, in this view of them, in her judgment and conscience, approve the one as right, &amp;c. and because it is so, and disapprove the other as wrong, &amp;c. and because it is so? Does not the natural sense pronounce this right judgment concerning them? Can the mind, at the same time, approve a morally good action or cha∣racter as being right and because it is right, and disapprove it be∣cause it is right, or as being wrong? Or can she approve that as right, which at the same time she disapproves as wrong? Or can she both approve and disapprove it because she sees it to be wrong and blame-worthy?—If the heart hates and rejects that which the understanding and conscience see and approve as right and worthy of esteem, and loves and chuses that which these see to be wrong, blame-worthy, and proper objects of moral ha∣tred, and disapprove as such; (which is often the case) does the heart thus counteract the conscience and moral sense, from the <HI>same views</HI> of the objects, which determine the judgment of
<PB N="9" REF="012066_0005_0F89938B72E4ABD8"/>
the conscience? Is it not because the heart is <HI>interested</HI> and rendered partial and perverse by her attachment to particular lusts, the indulgence whereof is inconsistent with moral truth and right, and for the sake of which, as best beloved, she hates and rejects the truth and right, embraces the evil and wrong? The mind approves the moral truth, viewing it as it is in itself, the heart rejects and hates it, <HI>relatively</HI> considered, or as opposing her lusts, from interested views. When this is the case, is not the man condemned of himself, in that which he allows in heart and practice? Does he not act inconsistently with himself, as well as with the rule of right, and do violence to the moral con∣stitution of his nature? When Judas betrayed his Master, did he not act from the heart, under the influence of covetousness and foolish resentment, in opposition to his judgment or conscience? And when he afterwards said,
<Q>I have sinned in that I have be∣trayed innocent blood,</Q>
did he not speak the language of the moral sense? Do you think, Doctor, that he now discovered any thing of a spiritual taste or holy temper of heart? Peter was an accurate divine. He says,
<Q>Balaam loved the <HI>wages</HI> of unrigh∣teousness</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 2.15.</NOTE>
For the sake of these he forsook the right way, knowing of it such, and went astray in the ways of unrighteous∣ness. And the apostle Jude speaking of some christian apostates, says,
<Q>They have ran greedily after the error of Balaam <HI>for re∣ward.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Jude 11.</NOTE> This Balaam forsook the right way, and went astray in the way of error and unrighteousness, with his eyes open. Was it because the way of error and unrighteousness appeared to him a more excellent, or amiable and pleasant way, <HI>in itself, simply con∣sidered as such,</HI> than the contrary way? Was it because he hated right and loved wrong for its own sake? Your doctrine says it was: but you see Peter and Jude have decided the case against you. This wicked man <HI>loved</HI> the <HI>wages</HI> of unrighteousness, and ran in that way as <HI>greedy</HI> of the <HI>reward</HI> of iniquity. Was not his hatred of the right way and love of the wrong, an <HI>interested</HI> and <HI>partial</HI> af∣fection, a <HI>secondary</HI> passion, a <HI>consequence</HI> and <HI>result</HI> of his love and greedy desire of the reward?</P>
<P>Doctor, think enough to answer all these questions right; and then read over the second part of my dialogue again, with perfect calmness, not in the spirit of a perverse disputer of this world, interested in misrepresenting its sense, but as an impartial, upright judge, as under his eye who sees all the artful windings of the
<PB N="10" REF="012066_0006_0F89938C35CDAA98"/>
crooked serpent, and approves the way of the upright; and I trust the mist will vanish from before your eyes, and that you will see clearly that you have essentially misrepresented my doctrine, and greatly wronged your brother, and, as you say,
<Q>havi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> arguing to no purpose, at least have not confuted M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but only a doctrine I have palmed on him, and which he has not taught.</Q>
(p. 157) This, Sir, is the very truth. I must help you a little more, that you may see it clearly.</P>
<P>In my account of the moral sense natural and essential to man as a moral agent, you think you find
<Q>a good definition of a spi∣ritual taste,</Q>
or holy love to spiritual good: But in this you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. That approbation which reason and the moral sense give to things morally good, which I spake of, as quoted above, is not the same thing with a supreme love and preferring choice of them by the heart; which is essential to true virtue. The first may exist while the other does not; which is often the case with men. You say to this purpose, that this approving perception of the mind implies true love of the heart, or at least necessarily draws it. But you are mistaken in this. The approbation of conscience or of the moral sense, and the ruling affection and choice of the heart, are frequently as far asunder, in sinful beings, as the city of God and the kingdom of Satan.— You also say to this purpose, that no natural man can see things morally good in a <HI>true</HI> light, or perceive their moral amlableness and excellence; and so says the writer of the notes in your appendix. I will allow you two things, Doctor; first, that men must have these things presented to their view by God's teaching, before they can perceive their moral excellence. Secondly, that natural men can't see them in so clear and <HI>realizing</HI> a light as holy men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, and yet re∣main carnal: but they may have their understanding so far en∣lightned, as to see them to be right, amiable in themselves, and worthy of esteem and honor, and approve them as such, and yet their heart be pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingaged, and continue attached to other objects less worthy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istent with these. This is enough to jus∣tify all I have said upon this subject in the dialogue.</P>
<P>Mr Edwards admits the distinction between the taste and ap∣probation of moral good or true virtue, by the conscience or mo∣ral sense, and that by a spiritual sense. He freely owne that the mind of the unrenewed man, if duly inlightened, may see, and by the moral sense approve a real beauty, excellence and amiableness in true virtue. This indeed he calls a <HI>secondary</HI> beauty, but says
<PB N="11" REF="012066_0006_0F89938C35CDAA98"/>
it belongs to moral things. This is not the less a real and true moral beauty because he calls it a secondary beauty. He was a great man, but not so great as to alter the nature of things by a dash of his pen; nor so great as to be exempted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the uni∣versal infirmity. He could err as well as you and I. If you should ever see my remarks on his piece upon true virtue, you will meet with some thoughts, which, perhaps, may do you no hurt.</P>
<P>But I here present you with a short passage or two from that piece. Mr. Edwards says,
<Q>Natural conscience, if well informed will approve of true virtue, and disapprove the want of it and opposition to it — Yea if mens consciences were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ully enlighten∣en—they would approve nothing but true virtue,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards on Virtue, p. 164, 165.</NOTE> There is a <HI>moral taste,</HI> or sense of moral good and evil, <HI>natural to all</HI> which does not properly arise out of self-love.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">ib. p. 166.</NOTE> This moral sense, If the understanding be well informed—approves the <HI>very same things,</HI> which a spiritual and divine sense approves, and those things only; tho' not on the same grounds, nor with the same kind of approbation.</Q>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">ib. 188.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the dialogue, p. 61, 62, you may find these words, viz.
<Q>I observed above, that the enmity of sinful souls against God's true character is directed against it, only <HI>relatively</HI> considered, and is a <HI>secondary</HI> passion, which arises in the heart in consequence of men's indulgence of particular lusts, which first lead them into a practical opposition to the law and righteous will of God▪ When the light of truth manifests their deeds to be evil and reproves them, and kindly calls them back into the right way, if they submit to the reproof, and obey the merciful call, their opposition to God ceases, no <HI>higher</HI> enmity can rise in their hearts; their enmity is turned against their own lusts: but if they refuse to receive reproof, and persist in their sins against light, the light becomes offensive, and they hate it as reproving them. <HI>The scorner hateth him that reproveth him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>After having offered some things in confirmation of this ac∣count of the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>spring</HI> of this wicked enmity. I say (p. 64)
<Q><HI>This</HI> doctrine concerning the enmity of carnal men against God, is further confirm'd by this observation, which holds universally true in fact, viz. That men who hate God, his ways, and righteous servants, always misrepresent their characters <HI>to themselves,</HI> paint them in false and odious colours, and place them in such a wrong view as to make them appear either contemptible or morally evil: <HI>This is the method they always take to justify to</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="012066_0007_0F89938CF2D79448"/>
THEMSELVES, <HI>as well as to others their enmity to them: which they would not do if moral rectitude wisdom, righteousness and goodness, were, in themselves objects of their natural hatred; but their hatred would point itself directly against them, as being what they really are; as in the case of natural aversions to some particular kinds of food.</HI> This hatred of wicked men against God is then an <HI>inte∣rested</HI> and <HI>partial</HI> affection, taken up in aid and support of some carnal lusts and interests is they are devoted to.</Q>
— Doctor, the sense of this paragraph is <HI>fixed</HI> and very obvious. 'Tis manifest as the light, that I speak of wicked men's misrepresenting God's character, &amp;c. to <HI>themselves</HI> as the method they take to <HI>justify to themselves</HI> their partial, unjust enmity to them. They do this to guard their wicked hearts, as far as they can, against the con∣de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mina reproaches of their reasonable minds, and the severe reproofs of their conscience or moral sense; which, when allowed to spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts own sense of things freely, under the influence of light is the understanding, justifies God and his ways, and freely co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s this unnatural enmity. This is agreeable to what I say, dialogue, p 66
<Q>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ever did <HI>speak evil</HI> of God's ways, viewing them as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as <HI>equitable</HI> and <HI>good</HI>; but as placing th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a wrong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight to themselves <HI>When they are obliged to see them as they truly are they are reduced to silence, and can object nothing to them: but justify and approve them as</HI> RIGHT, <HI>and condemn themselves.</HI></Q>
—Poor creatures, they can enjoy no self approbation and quiet but under the gloomy shade of per∣verse misrepresentation. Hence it is that men obstinately bent upon sin, <HI>close their own eyes stop their ears make their hearts gross, lest they should see hear and vnderstand;</HI> when they do if they do not return, they are, like the discovered thief, in the terrors of the shadow of death.</P>
<P>Let us next observe, Doctor, how you have <HI>forced</HI> these passa∣ges into your service; for indeed you have constrained them to serve in a state of cruel bondage, contrary to their nature, and wholly against their will. You often quote part of both of them, as in the pages referred to in the margin, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. 71, 72, 74, 90, 132.</NOTE> but have never once, as I have observed, quoted any part of what I have now put in <HI>Italics,</HI> nor given your readers the least hint of any such clauses, which fix the sense of the whole, (tho' you must have observed them yourself) but keep them out of sight: you could not per∣vert them. I desire you, and all who read this, will turn your eyes back on these extracts, and observe the parts printed in Ita∣lics, and then compare them with your quotations refer'd to be∣low,
<PB N="13" REF="012066_0007_0F89938CF2D79448"/>
and observe the use you make of what you venture to show your readers—it may give an edifying blush — The things you have quoted, you so artfully weave in with your own misre∣presentations as to make them look a little favorable to them, to a careless reader. But whoever will give himself the trouble to compare as I have requested, will very easily discover the imposi∣tion that is practised upon him. The sense you constantly put upon these passages is this. That men and all moral beings, have naturally a holy love to Gods true character, and never do or can hate him, but as he is viewed by the mind in a false and odi∣ous character, either as a morally evil or contemptible being. It would be an affront to the reader's understanding to say any thing more to convince him that the passages given above fully condemn you; they speak for themselves. Doctor, in this shame∣ful misrepresentation of my doctrine, you have greatly injured me, abused and misled your readers, and dishonored yourself.</P>
<P>Let us examine another passage which you have made great use of, and observe how you have perverted and abused it. After I had finished what I designed upon the doctrine of the enmity of wicked men against God, in opposition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you wrong notions of it, I just mentioned <HI>another kind</HI> of enmity, in properly called en∣mity to God's character or real works, which is sometimes found in good men, who by the grace of God, are cured of that kind of enmity which rises out of the perverseness of a wicked heart, These were my words.
<Q>Since we are upon the melancholy subject of the enmity of poor sinners against God, I will just mention one thing more.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Many very honest and good people have often complained of the workings of a secret enmity and hard thoughts of God, and quarrellings against him; <HI>which does n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> like that we have been discoursing upon, arise out of the</HI> WICKEDNESS <HI>of the heart,</HI> but is wholly occasioned by misrepresentations of the character and ways of God to the mind, and false and wrong views of him, which have unhappily gotten possession of the mind, and are supposed thro' ignorance and wrong instruction, to be the true and genuine views of his character and works. In the light wherein they view them they appear morally evil, wrong, and objects of just hatred. The enmity which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind conceives against them, viewed in this wrong light, is, in a proper sense, a natural enmity, i e it arises <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he moral frame of the mind, and the innate sense of the hatefulness of actions and characters morally evil and wrong: and if the heart is gracious this sense is greatly heightened. This kind of enmity is, in no true con∣struction,
<PB N="14" REF="012066_0008_0F89938DB417D890"/>
a hatred of God's true character, which may he hear∣tily approv'd and lov'd at the same time; but only of a really bad character, falsely ascribed to him, merely thro' ignorance, mistake and misinformation. This may be illustrated by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> case of a child educated abroad, who has lust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d into his mind perhaps by the foolish tattle of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urse or school-master, very wrong and injurious notions of his father's character <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and designs towards him; representing him as very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ble, arbitrary and cruel, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d hypocritical towards him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whereas in truth he is quite the reverse This wrong view raises in the child disa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion, hard and blaming thoughts▪ His father, who knows the case, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ties him, considering it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igno∣rance and error, not malice against his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.

(D p. 68.69)</P>
<P>Doctor, you secquently quote passages from this paragraph, and misrepresent their sense in a most pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> manner You n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where give your renders the least him that I am here speaking of a case of an entirely different nature from that of the vicious en∣mity of the ungodly, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses out of the wickedness of the heart, and which I have been discoursing of before, tho' you could not but know that I was; but you constantly represent me to your readers as speaking of the vicious enmity, and apply what I say upon this <HI>improper</HI> enmity, to that of the wicked as my ac∣count of the nature and source of their enmity against God, his truth and ways. The manner of my introducing this paragraph, and these words, referring to that kind of enmity I was here des∣cribing, viz <HI>which does not like that we have been discoursing upon, arise o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of the wickedness of the heart,</HI> fix the scufe and application of the whole, and fully evidence your injustice and extreme unfair∣ness in your application of this to the enmity of the wicked, in the manner you do.—Such as are curious to see your quotations from this paragraph, and the perverse abuse of them, may consult the pages referred to in the margin.—You quote me as saying, 'many 'very honest and good <HI>sort of</HI> people. These words, <HI>sort of,</HI> you have added to the text, and give as many words.

<P><PB N="15" REF="012066_0008_0F89938DB417D890"/>In general, Doctor, you have improved the quotations you make from the paragraph given above, to persuade your readers that I admit no other kind or worse sort of enmity against God, in the wickedest men and even in devils themselves, than that improper enmity there described; and that I hold that wicked men and devils have at bottom, a <HI>temper of heart disposed to love God,</HI> and only want to have their ignorance removed, and their wrong speculative notions concerning him rectified, in order to their love shewing itself in actual exercise.—You say in particular.
<Q>It appears, according to Mr. H. that the <HI>only difference</HI> between the hatred of God which is in the righteous and wicked, lies in this, viz. the wicked misrepresent God's character to themselves, and so are the cause of the misrepresentation (tho' on his princi∣ples, they do it without any hatred of God) while the righteous, or very good [<HI>sort of</HI>] people</Q>
(quoted again as my words, with a contemptuous sneer—the contempt be to whom it belongs)
<Q>have him misrepresented to them, by wrong instructions, and so are not the active cause of affixing this false character to God; but yet after the false representation is made, <HI>they both</HI> have the <HI>same</HI> enmity to it, only the gracious heart will hate it in a higher degree And you say, 'this (kind of enmity) 'is ALL and the WORST that can be found in any man,</Q>
(p 73.) i. e. accor∣ding to my doctrine.—Can any thing be said more foolish, false, perversely injurious? If your reader makes his judgment of my doctrines from your account of them, he will be <HI>totally deceived.</HI>
<Q>Surely your turning things upside down shall be esteemed as the Potter's clay.</Q></P>
<P>Two or three passages more, I take a little notice of, and then close this scene.</P>
<P>You tells us (p. 98) Mr. H. says,
<Q>God considered <HI>simply i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> himself</HI> cannot be hated; yet <HI>relatively</HI> considered he possibly may;</Q>
and say,
<Q>Mr. H puts the change on his readers by the words, <HI>relatively considered.</HI> Just as tho' to consider God as <HI>related</HI> to us, as our Creator and Lord, were different from con∣sidering him as he is in himself.</Q>
(Why do you drop the word <HI>simply?</HI> Are you not putting the change upon your readers?) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not God <HI>in</HI> himself our sovereign creator and governor?' If you had dropped the word <HI>in,</HI> as well as, <HI>simply considered,</HI> I should have answered, <HI>Yes.</HI> I will state the question as you should have done, if you meant to say any thing to the purpose, and do you answer it. Is not God <HI>considered simply in himself,</HI> our creator and governor? Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he is viewed <HI>only in respect to his essential</HI> character, to his nature, not in his words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt

himself, and his consequent relations to the works of his hands <HI>simply considered</HI> he is regarded only as being what he is <HI>in himself</HI> what he was before he began creation. Was God our creator &amp;c before we were created? Is it essential to his nature to cre¦ate us? If so, God had not in himself all that is essential to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nature till you and I came into existence.—You put more puzzling questions.
<Q>Does it not <HI>essentially</HI> belong to him to create and govern <HI>his creatures?</HI></Q>
I suspect you had no ideas here. If you mean that the works and relations of God as creator and gover∣nor, belong to the divine <HI>essence,</HI> you have your answer above If you mean that God having created, tis essential to his relativ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> character of creator that he did create the creatures he has crea∣ted, and that it belongs to him, as their maker, to care for, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> govern them; it is doubtless so. If you don't mean one of these you mean nothing. If you mean either, or both, your question is nothing to the purpose — You add,
<Q>Is it not essential t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the divine nature to oppose our particular lusts and private in∣terests, which are contrary to his nature? Is not God essentially as he is in himself, necessarily opposite to every sin?</Q>
His ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nature is essentially opposed to all moral evil or unrighteousnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> You say,
<Q>If it is, then to consider him <HI>as opposing some particul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lusts of ours, or some of our private interests,</HI> is to consider him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he is <HI>in himself.</HI></Q>
If what you mean by this, is, that this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consider him as acting in character, or in a manner which is tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> agreeable to his holy nature; I agree with you. But what ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you gained? What have you proved by this? Just nothing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all. Thus to consider God, is not to consider him
<Q>simply himself,</Q>
but <HI>relatively,</HI> as opposing some of our lusts, or priva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> interests; i. e. as opposing <HI>us</HI> in <HI>our</HI> evil ways, menacing or i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦flicting punishment therefor This, Doctor, is just that relativ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> interesting view of God, of his moral perfections in act and exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦cise, in relation to the sinner, in which view of him.

<Q>Does not Mr. H then make a distinction where there is no dif¦ference?</Q>
No, Doctor, I do not. Don't you see the diffe∣rence? When you consider God's moral characters of truth equity, goodness, simply as such, or in an abstracted view, with¦out any regard to their aspect upon you, your reason, your nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ral moral sense, will pronounce them right, and approve them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worthy of esteem and honor: In this simple <HI>uninterested</HI> view them, you can't hate them: but if you should come to see th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="17" REF="012066_0009_0F89938E746C5D48"/>
God, in the exercise of these divine virtues, frowns upon you for your great unfairness and injustice in perverting my doctrine in the manner you have done, and your manifold abuses of me in your piece, essentially contrary to the spirit of goodness and justice, you would certainly, <HI>necessarily,</HI> be displeased, either with him or yourself; if with God for opposing you, your heart would gender hatred Your wrong doings are, even now,
<Q>practical opposition, or enmity if you please, against his h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, law and will.</Q>
When you see this. I hope your displeasure will turn into the right channel, and that the divine frown will then give place to the gracious smile.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all the noise you make about my distinguish∣ing between a <HI>simple</HI> and <HI>relative</HI> view of God's character, &amp;c. you sometimes go into it yourself: the distinction is so natural you fall into it, even while you are cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aring it in me. I give you one instance. You tell us (p 100)
<Q>Mr. H. thinks he has fully proved that the worst of men <HI>love</HI> the truth <HI>considered in itself,</HI> because the pharisees condemned the conduct of the hus∣bandmen who slew their lord's servants and son, till they saw their own face in the glass.</Q>
No, Doctor, I did not say, or un∣dertake to prove, that they <HI>love</HI> truth or righteousness, as you un∣derstand love to imply <HI>virtuous love.</HI> I said, and bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t this exam∣ple to prove that sinners, by the moral faculty, may see, and seeing <HI>do approve</HI> righteousness and moral good, as a right thing, amiable in itself, and worthy of esteem and honor; and that they hate it only <HI>relatively considered,</HI> and from <HI>interested</HI> views: and it does fully prove this. And you, in attempting to invalidate this evi∣dence, confirm it, and even make it prove more than I desire it should. Your words are these,
<Q>Let us see what his witness proves. Why, it <HI>very plainly</HI> proves, (1) That the worst of men have a conscience capable of perceiving the truth. (2) That when they <HI>see themselves concerned in it,</HI> they <HI>love</HI> or HATE it, <HI>according as it agrees</HI> or <HI>disagrees</HI> with what is, in their view, <HI>their own interest</HI> and will treat it accordingly. (3) Therefore that <HI>mere selfishness</HI> will lead the worst of men to love or <HI>hate</HI> the same truth, as it appears to favor or oppose them.</Q>
—Don't you see, Doctor, that you have here conceded all that I brought this example to prove; that the <HI>hatred</HI> of vicious beings against moral truth is an <HI>interested partial</HI> thing, opposed to their moral sense of what this truth deserves? How glorious is your opposition to me, for saying the same thing that you do! But, Doctor, you err a little, even here. I no where called this interested regard to moral truth and righteousness, <HI>love</HI> to them. It is unworthy
<PB N="18" REF="012066_0010_0F89938F34186D00"/>
the name; for it never ingages the hearts of the wicked in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> service: but their <HI>hatred</HI> to these, tho' it takes its rise from inte¦rested views and vicious passions, as you plainly confess, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> becomes, in the impenitent and obstinate, a fixed and governing passion, and a source of infinite wickedness, mischief and misery. Besides, you had no warrant from this example of the malicious pharisees, to say any thing about this false love to moral truth. For the <HI>righteous</HI> judgment, upon the parabolical story, which the Lord drew them in to give, did not spring from, was not dic∣tated by <HI>self love,</HI> or any regard to private interest: their hasty reversal of this judgment <HI>only,</HI> proceeded from thence. They did not apprehend themselves at all interested or concern'd in the case till the Lord applied their judgment. This judgment was dictated by that moral discernment and moral sense which is es∣sential to all moral beings and which no degree of wickedness can destroy. The judgment of this sense is <HI>impartial</HI> and <HI>disinte∣rested.</HI> When the light flows in upon it, and it is allowed to speak its own sense freely, it judges impartially, in every soul, of his <HI>own</HI> actions, as of other men's, without fear or favor: it only regards the right of the case. Hence the endeavors of wicked minds to blind and deceive themselves: hence their hatred and <HI>dread</HI> of the light.—I said,
<Q>Enmity to God is a <HI>secondary</HI> pas∣sion.</Q>
In the note, p. 102, you say,
<Q>This he explains thus: <HI>A consequence and result of wrong affections indulged in opposition to the law and will of God.</HI> But are not wrong affections, especially when indulged,</Q>
—thus,
<Q>themselves enmity to God, in the scripture sense? Mr. H. in the next breath answers, YES; for <HI>any particular wrong affection—thus indulg'd is</HI></Q>
(practical opposi∣tion or) '<HI>enmity to the law of God.</HI>' You suppressed the words I now put in a parenthesis, I suppose, that you might represent me as inconsistent with myself; for you immediately add,
<Q>How the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is enmity <HI>a consequence and result of these wrong affections indulged?</HI></Q>
I told you how, in the next words following those you last quo∣ted, viz. 'These' (wrong affections, which indulged, I said <HI>are practical</HI> opposition or enmity to the law of God)
<Q>These, per∣sisted in against light, will <HI>draw after them a higher</HI> and <HI>more ma∣lignant kind</HI> of enmity against God, as standing in the way of such indulged lusts.</Q>
D. p. 60. I also said, p. 61,
<Q>Particular lusts—first lead men into a practical opposition to the law and righteous will of God. When the light of truth manifests their deeds to be evil, reproves—and calls them back—if they submit to the reproof, and obey the merciful call, their opposition fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God ceases, no <HI>higher</HI> enmity can rise in their hearts. But if
<PB N="19" REF="012066_0010_0F89938F34186D00"/>
they refuse to receive reproof, and persist in their sins against light, the light becomes offensive, and they hate it as reproving them: <HI>The scorner hateth him that reproveth him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Doctor, you certainly saw these passages; but it was not for your purpose to shew them to your reader: if would have ruined your design.—In p. 103, you ask this question,
<Q>Are not <HI>wrong affections</HI> and <HI>carnal lusts something like enmity</HI> to God?</Q>
and seem to think this a <HI>confounding stroke.</HI> Do you mean such affections and lusts, considered <HI>as indulged</HI> by the man, in opposi∣tion to God's will? If so, I had told you before, that they are 'practical enmity to God's law. But if you mean here to con∣sider them as not <HI>indulged,</HI> but <HI>restrained</HI> and <HI>over ruled</HI> by the mind, as I suspect you do; I desire you to answer me one ques∣tion, which may help you to answer yours right. You think your self some way injured by your brother: resentment rises, a moti∣on tending to revenge; the devil whispers such a tho't into your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear: the tendency of this tho't and motion is to enmity: you instantly perceive its evil nature; you don't indulge it at all, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmediately resist, reject and suppress it with displeasure in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear of God. Do you in this 'look <HI>something like</HI>' one who has a heart of '<HI>enmity to God,</HI>' or of dutiful conformity to him? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Doctor, you say, p. 103. note,
<Q>Those who have never been convinced that, not only actual sins, but even their <HI>very best tempers, in their best frames,</HI> while unregenerate, are <HI>nothing but opposition and enmity to God's true character</HI> have never had a just and scriptural view of God's character, but are still ignorant of the true God and of themselves —This is Mr. Hopkins's doc∣trine, the height and perfection of it: by a lopting this doctrine, you are become answerable for it: let us examine it a little — Unregenerate men, in their best frames, under the influence of common grace, are sometimes in such tempers or dispositions, or have such motions and actings of soul as these, viz. They are greatly afraid of God's wrath; they with for his mercy to sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e them from it, they see so much of the wrongness, folly, baseness, and destructive tendency of their former evil ways, of some of them at least, as that they really blame themselves, feel ashamed, are sorry, and wish they had not done as they have done. I don't suppose these are holly exercises— But how will you prove that there is <HI>nothing</HI> in these inward motions and frames of their hearts but opposition and enmity to God's true character?</Q>
What is there in this character, which these are in opposition and enmi∣ty to? Do they oppose his truth, or justice, or goodness, or mercy? Does not the truth of their case justify their fear and shame? Is this truth opposite to the truth of God? Do they not <HI>justly</HI> blame themselves? Is this <HI>enmity</HI> against God's justice or goodness? Is their desire that God will have mercy upon them, in enmity to the merciful nature of God? If these are nothing but opposition to God's true character, he is in opposition to them, and hates and disallows them, and they are forbid by some law of God. Can you shew any such law?

<Q>Fear ye not me? When they had committed abominations they could not blush, neither were they ashamed—Ye are they that justify yourselves.</Q>
Doctor, if you have formed a character of God, which is opposition and enmity to these frames and motions, stirred up in the hearts of sinners, by the teachings and common influence of the Spirit of God, you have <HI>undoubtedly,</HI> in your imagination, changed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> glory of the incorruptible God into a monstrous image. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rather think you have taken up this absurd doctrine, and others without reflection. If so, I trust you will renounce it again. I know what may be said for it in a caviling way; but stick to your text. According to that, your business is to prove tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there is nothing <HI>positive</HI> in the very best tempers of sinners, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their best frames, under the highest influences of common grace▪ but what is 'opposition and enmity to God's true character.'

<P>I just mention another of your wrong headed errors. You say 'Every <HI>real</HI> penitent sees that he <HI>grows worse.</HI>' p. 118. Doctor you are strangely regardless of what you say.</P></NOTE></P>

from the scandalous heresies you have charged me with, as you desired your reader to do, if he found this the case, that you might have the honor of retracting your error, (p. 107.) And now, Doctor, I expect you will do yourself the honor, and me the justice publicly to retract these false and injurious charges. If you do so, I will forgive you this wrong, and desire the churches to whom you dedicated your false accusations will do so too.— But I have other matters to settle with you, Doctor.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I shall next attend to what you say upon that paragraph, wherein I mention the silencing the blasphemy of reprobate souls, by the force of truth. These are my words, viz.
<Q>Any particular sinful affection indulged in opposition to the will of God, is practical opposition or <HI>enmity</HI> to the law of God. These per∣sisted in <HI>against light, will draw after them</HI> a <HI>higher</HI> and <HI>more malignant</HI> kind of enmity against God, as standing in the way of such indulged lusts And in this case, if the sense of God's righteousness in opposing and condemning the sinner in his evil ways is <HI>weak,</HI> and the sense of his own faultiness <HI>low</HI> and <HI>dull,</HI> this enmity may flame out dreadfully, and work up to blasphemy and cursing. This is the present state of devils, and in a sad degree the case of some men. But it is a <HI>great mis∣take</HI> to suppose and teach that things will remain in this <HI>horrid confusion</HI> in wicked minds, forever, as too many do.—When God comes near to judgment he will reveal his righteousness from heaven, and impress upon all wicked souls, both of men and devils, such a clear, convincing, strong sense of the equity, fairness, and <HI>real kindness</HI> of his dispensations towards them in their former state of trial, of the heinousness of their offences, and of the justice and moral necessity of his present sentence of condemnation (which impression will never be suffered to wear off, any more) as will so far overbalance their natural self love, as to <HI>oblige</HI> them to <HI>justify</HI> God's character, conduct and judg∣ment, in <HI>word</HI> and <HI>mind;</HI> and <HI>forever silence all murmurings, in∣jurious reflections</HI> and <HI>hard speeches against him,</HI> and all <HI>blasphemy</HI> and <HI>cursings</HI> of their maker; their rage will turn inward <HI>against themselves,</HI> as the flame of a reverberating furnace falls with all its force upon the melting metal.</Q>
(D. p. 60, 61.) You tell us, Doctor, that the thoughts in this long passage appear to you <HI>quite new,</HI> (p. 81) and you appear quite frighted, and see as many spectres rising up before you, as a timorous girl ever does in the dark; and you endeavor to alarm your readers by your pokerish descriptions of the creatures of your imagination; such as these,
<Q>That the damned at the day of judgment will <HI>love</HI> God's true
<PB N="22" REF="012066_0012_0F899390B4123728"/>
character—that they will <HI>necessarily</HI> love, and cannot hate him— that the minds of the damned shall be calmed, and suited to their state—that there will be a <HI>happy ae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> for devils and repro∣bate souls,</Q>
&amp;c. (p. 81, 82, 83.)</P>
<P>But let us try, Doctor, if we can't lay these evil spirits, which so haunt and terrify you.—The tho' is which you own to be quite new to you, are not so to <HI>all the world.</HI> Mr. Edwards expresses himself much to the same purpose— He says,
<Q>Christians have the greatest reason to believe, from the scriptures, that in the future day of the revelation of the <HI>righteous</HI> judgment of God, when sinners shall be called to answer before their judge, and all their wickedness, in all its aggravations <HI>clearly manifested</HI> in the <HI>perfect light</HI> of <HI>that</HI> day, and God will reprove them, and set their sins in order <HI>before them,</HI> their consciences will be greatly awakened and <HI>convinced,</HI> their mouths will be STOPPED—their consciences will <HI>approve</HI> the dreadful sentence of their judge; and <HI>seeing</HI> that they have <HI>deserved</HI> so great a punishment, will <HI>join with the judge in condemning them</HI></Q>
—He adds,
<Q>Their wicked∣nes will <HI>then</HI> be bro't to perfection.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Edwards on Virtue, p. 166, 167.</NOTE> Which is <HI>true.</HI> I did not imagine any one would have understood me as intimating that they will <HI>then</HI> be <HI>converted</HI> to the holy love of God. I only said what is implied in Mr. Edwards's words, and that their rage and reproaches will then turn against themselves: which is the natural result of a full conviction that God is perfectly good and perfectly just, and they themselves the authors of their own ruin, in a state of final condemnation and despair.</P>
<P>The truths, Doctor, which are impressed upon the minds of the condemned, at the time of Judgment, are not fitted in their nature <HI>as they respect them,</HI> to <HI>quicken</HI> and <HI>sanctify</HI> their hearts, but to <HI>kill</HI> them; to justify God in his ways and judgment upon them, and to extort from them a permanent justification of him, a true confession before him, of his faithfulness and equity, of their evil desert, and a condemnation of themselves, all which necessa∣rily turn their wrath and their reproaches <HI>against themselves</HI>; which instead of lessening, Increases their torment —This conviction is not willingly admitted, but forced upon them, by the force of the <HI>two edged sword which proceeds out of his mouth.</HI> If they could, they would throw it off, and return to the mise∣rable expedient of misrepresenting <HI>to themselves,</HI> and reviling God's ways and judgments as <HI>unequal,</HI> as some poor relief from the tor∣ment of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own self condemning reflections. But it is now impossible. This conviction of the truth, respecting them, is fix∣ed, and riveted in their souls forever.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="012066_0012_0F899390B4123728"/>Self-love, Doctor, in wicked and rejected souls, still works as a desire of <HI>self esteem,</HI> and of esteem from others, as a desire of life and happiness. And as the truth of their case obstructs the way of these motions, this self love springs rancorous hatred of this truth; and, as its only remaining resource, falls to misrepresent∣ing and blaspheming the truth and the God of truth, laying the blame of its disappointment on God, or any where, rather than on self. But the truth, as impress'd by God on the mind, is of power sufficient to bear down this spring of blasphemy, and carry away all resistance before it, and will do this, when God comes near to judgment. This spirit, thus shut up from this opening, will necessarily fall upon the sinner himself with the whole force of its disappointed passions, as the true cause of his own undoing; and his remaining and eternal quarrel will be against himself, and the wicked helpers of his ruin. Self hatred, and killing sorrow, and fruitless repentance, lamentation and woe, will be his ever∣lasting portion; which our Lord describes by <HI>weeping, wailing,</HI> and <HI>gnashing of teeth.</HI> How great this misery!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor, don't imagine again that I am giving the condemned holy tempers. This <HI>self hatred,</HI> repentance, and revenge against self, do not spring from love to truth, but from self-love fatally disappointed by <HI>self folly,</HI> and <HI>self destroying</HI> wickedness. This you may see in Judas:
<Q>He repented, and went and hanged himself.</Q></NOTE>—In this sense Doctor, not in that you suggest,
<Q>the minds of the condemned will be <HI>suited to their state.</HI></Q>
The more suited the more misera∣ble.</P>
<P>God will get the victory at last, when he comes with

<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Jude 14.15.</NOTE> Then every mouth shall be <HI>stopped,</HI> and every tongue <HI>confess to God</HI>: And the wicked, who, <HI>now</HI> while God is <HI>departed,</HI> and <HI>hideth</HI> himself from them, <HI>set the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mouth against the heavens,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 73.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> shall make <HI>their own tongue to fall up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> themselves</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. 64.8.</NOTE>—But as you, Doctor, and too many others, repre∣sent the case, the victory of God over his incorrigible enemies, never will be <HI>compleat</HI>: the victory of authority and power over their persons is indeed so. in subjecting them to a state of just punishment; but the victory of truth over their minds never is so Don't misapprehend me, Sir, I don't mean the <HI>saving</HI> truth, but the <HI>condemning, silencing, killing</HI> truth, which concerns them at the time of judgment. If they stand before their judge, and go

away from the judgment feat, blaspheming and cursing their ma∣ker and their judge, 'tis evident the condemning truth has not gained its rightful dominion over their minds: but if this killing sword sticks fast in their souls, and compels them to <HI>think</HI> and <HI>speak now</HI> and <HI>always,</HI> the things that are <HI>just</HI> and <HI>true</HI> concerning God and themselves, the victory of God is <HI>compleat,</HI> and their misery is compleat; and God is glorified to the utmost, in this dreadful catastrophe of wickedness.—This is undoubtedly the truth. By a contrary manner of representing the matter, God is really dishonored, tho' without design. If these tho'ts seem strange and wrong, it is from want of close and just reflection on the subject, on the holy scriptures relating to this subject, and on moral nature.</P>
<P>I just mention two of your observations on the passage above transcribed. First, you say,
<Q>The damned, if we may believe Mr. H. will not be in so <HI>horrid confusion</HI> always as they now are No! the <HI>happy</HI> time is coming when their confusion shall not be so <HI>horrible</HI> and dreadful; but if their minds shall be calmed, and every murmur silenced, their minds shall be suited to their state—Happy aera!</Q>
(p. 81.) Doctor, you can't un∣derstand any thing that I say. The <HI>horrid confusion</HI> which I said should not last forever, respects only the blasphemous rage against God. I there used the word <HI>confusion</HI> in the same sense that God uses it in the law, where speaking of some unnatural, monstrous sins, he says, they are '<HI>confusion,</HI>' i. e. totally confound the order of nature; just as a wicked wretch does, when instead of con∣demning himself he condemns his maker. As to that confusion of face and mind, which is the natural result of sin, it will then be compleat, when this other kind of confusion is <HI>silenced.</HI>— No, no, Doctor, the minds of the wicked will <HI>never be calmed,</HI> but the storm dreadfully <HI>heightened,</HI> at the time of judgment; only the wind will then blow in a contrary direction: and whereas the raging waves before sometimes broke <HI>against the heavens,</HI> now they break and discharge their whole force upon the miserable criminal himself; for God now rules the storm. There is order, in this confusion; the order of the governing truth and righte∣ousness of God: it answers to the true nature of things, and in its way is praise to him. But can blasphemy ever be praise to God? Doctor, do think.</P>
<P N="2">2. You say,
<Q>I believe no one besides Mr. H. ever taught that a <HI>weak</HI> sense of God's righteousness in opposing the sinner in his evil way, and a <HI>low</HI> and <HI>dull</HI> sense of the sinners own faultiness or ill desert, was, is, or can be the CAUSE of their rage, blasphe∣my
<PB N="25" REF="012066_0013_0F89939174645A80"/>
and cursing God,</Q>
(p. 81, 82.) <HI>Nor he neither.</HI> Doctor, you blunder perpetually, and <HI>stumble at noon day as in the night.</HI> Please to turn your eye back on the passage you here refer to I there assigned the sinner's <HI>wilfulness</HI> in sinning on against light, as the <HI>cause</HI> or source of his blasphemous enmity against God; and his perceiving God's opposition to him in his evil way, as the <HI>oc∣casion</HI> of its flaming out. I only mention a <HI>weak</HI> sense of &amp;c. and a <HI>low</HI> and dull sense of, &amp;c. as <HI>insufficient</HI> to restrain the flow of this cursed passion; insufficient <HI>because weak, low,</HI> and <HI>dull</HI> — Doctor, what I said is almost in direct opposition to what you suggest. Don't you see that I consider this sense as having a na∣tural tendency to restrain the sinner from blaspheming God, and insufficient to effect it, only from its being too weak and low? I am sorry to see you continually expose yourself as you do: you leave your intelligent reader no other option but pity or con∣tempt.</P>
<P>Almost all your reasonings against me, are founded upon a misapprehension and wrong representation of my doctrines and sentiments: For this reason I take little notice of them. So are those of your friend in the notes in your appendix. I call them so because I think you wrote few of them. Perhaps I am mista∣ken: if I am it is no great fault: you are not robbed of any glory.</P>
<P N="5">V. Let us now, Doctor, open a new scene—You say (p 117) 'He that carefully reads and attends to what he' (Mr. H)
<Q>says in his dialogue, especially in p. 30,—36 must see that he has <HI>no conception</HI> of salvation <HI>by free grace alone,</HI> but makes <HI>works</HI> and the sinners <HI>endeavors</HI> the <HI>moral</HI> GROUND or <HI>reason</HI> why God bestows on him <HI>renewing</HI> and <HI>pardoning</HI> mercy.</Q>
No, Doctor, such an one will see no such thing: no such thing exists. Indeed they that read with your passion and prejudice may possibly imagine and <HI>say</HI> such a thing. You add,
<Q>I will point out a few things. Mr, H supposes that the awakened, unrenewed sinner takes pains to become better,</Q>
&amp;c. &amp;c. (p. 118) Here, Doctor, you quote a few scraps of sentences, picked up here and there, and patch them together with your usual art. Some you have given right, some wrong, and some you have made yourself, and given to your reader as mine, as you have done many other things; for which I neither thank not honor you: this is one,
<Q>Mr. H. sup∣poses that the awakened, unrenewed sinner, truly repents,</Q>
(p. 118▪)</P>
<P>Doctor, you and Mr. Hopkins have greatly misrepresented my doctrine relating to the influence of common grace, and the acti∣ons
<PB N="26" REF="012066_0014_0F89939234020A88"/>
of awakened sinners under it, and both much alike. Why did you not act like honest men, and state my doctrine fairly, and if you had objections to it, offer them clearly? Another method pleased you better.—You, Doctor, misrepresent and aggravate things to the utmost. You say,
<Q>Mr. H. supposes that the awa∣kened, unrenewed sinner grows <HI>better</HI> under conviction, and <HI>therefore</HI> is <HI>more likely</HI> to obtain mercy, and that there is <HI>no encou∣ragement at all</HI> for sinners to strive or hope, if this is not the case. Thus, <HI>according to him,</HI> the sinner's <HI>growing better</HI> is the ONLY GOSPEL GROUND <HI>of his hope.</HI>—Thrice admirable! No com∣ment can illustrate the absurdity of this</Q>
(p. 118.) Doctor, you have made your comment already, and entirely perverted the text. Your boldness in <HI>falsely accusing</HI> is very wonderful —But let us hear you further.
<Q>Mr. H's reasoning, p 30.—36, a∣mounts to this, viz. That awakened sinners should be taught that they really <HI>grow better, really please God</HI> in their conduct, and are <HI>less guilty</HI> than when secure, and that this is a <HI>ground</HI> and <HI>reason</HI> why they should partake of the divine favor rather than others,</Q>
(p. 119)
<Q>The only way to keep sinners from discouragement, and prompt them to—constancy in seeking af∣ter salvation, is to persuade them that they <HI>really grow better,</HI> and may hope, <HI>by their further increase in goodness,</HI> to obtain the favor they need,</Q>
(p. 120.) After much more to this purpose in the same spirit of false representation, you become so inflamed with your own imaginations as to cry out in a transport of <HI>absur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> zeal,
<Q>Such is Mr. H's religion, such his views of the way of sal∣vation by Christ,</Q>
(p. 122.) Doctor, if you had spoken the language of truth in your exclamation, you would have said Such is the religion
<Q>I have palmed upon Mr. H. tho' he never taught it,</Q>
such are the views I give of his notions concerning the way of salvation by Christ, tho' he has not given the same himself, nor any thing like them: But I am wrathful mad with him for censuring some of my false doctrines, and see every thing he says, in a wrong light.—You proceed thus,
<Q>No word that I know of can sufficiently describe the wickedness, impiety and absurdity of this opinion, except those of St. Paul, Gal. 1 8, 9. But if we, or an angel from heaven,</Q>
preach any othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gospel than that we have preached, <HI>let him be accursed.</HI>
<Q>If we ever discover zeal, surely it may be shewn on an occasion lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this,</Q>
(p. 122. Doctor, you are <HI>like a bear bereaved of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whelps:</HI> But be calm, I beseech you; stand still and consider In your folly you have cast the apostolic curse at my head, be have taken your aim wrong. You only curse your own misre∣presentations.
<PB N="27" REF="012066_0014_0F89939234020A88"/>
I have not taught, nor believed the scandalous doctrines you curse me for: you can't support your charge: you greatly abuse both me and your readers. The wine you here set before the churches, is <HI>the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.</HI></P>
<P>I have critically re examined the pages you refer to and find nothing that gives the least hint of the wicked doctrines you charge me with. I verily believe, if you was to be prosecuted before the church for defamation, as you justly might be, you would be wholly at a loss what passages in the dialogue to fix upon for your justification, and might as easily support your charge by quoting these words of our Lord, <HI>Men shall revile you, and speak all manner of evil against you, falsely,</HI> as by any thing I said.</P>
<P>I censured some of your's and Mr. Hopkin's corrupt doctrines, and now you have executed an unrighteous and <HI>unmanly</HI> revenge. The doctrines I opposed to your errors, rightly understood, are above just censure. You could make no figure in opposing them, as fairly stated. You have declined the combat on this ground, and thereby implicitly justified my doctrine. You have brought upon the stage a set of doctrines which are no more mine than those of yours that I opposed, doctrines really very bad; and pretending you had found them in my dialogue, raise a loud cry against me as an abominable heretick, and most dangerous, wick∣ed man, and endeavor to alarm the churches. But they have no great cause of fear from this quarter: Your imaginary heresies will do them no harm, unless they believe them real.—Doctor, has Caiaphas been in your counsel? Have you heard the outcry against Paul the <HI>great</HI> heretick?
<Q>Away with such a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that he should live—They threw dust into the air.</Q>
—You have thrown dust into your readers eyes.</P>
<P>I observe, Doctor, you renew many of Mr. Hopkins's trifling complaints, as his <HI>echo.</HI> Among others, you speak of my writing against one of his doctrines before I had seen his book, and his defence of it, not then published, and apply these words,
<Q>He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him,</Q>
(p. 129) Doctor, you knew I had seen all I remark'd upon, and more. And I understood, and fairly represented the doctrine. But you, after having my dialogue in your hands many months, have undertaken to answer it, and yet appear not to have understood it, and have essentially misrepresented my doc∣trines, and foolishly wasted your time, and diverted your readers,
<PB N="28" REF="012066_0015_0F899392F28C8958"/>
by attacking the creatures of your own imagination. This, Doctor, is answering a matter <HI>before it is heard,</HI> according to the <HI>true sense</HI> of the proverb.</P>
<P>You say, Doctor, I appear angry, in my letter to Mr. Hopkins. I was not angry, in the sense you intend; nor am I with you. But I saw his great unfairness, perverse misrepresentations, and want of honor in his writing; and see the same in yours, and in a higher degree. I resent such things, and have a ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> abhorrence and contempt of them; and hope you will see them in a true light, and abhor them in yourself, and renounce them forever. If you do, you will honor yourself in the eyes of the wise and good.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Suffer me, Doctor, to turn your eye upon another object. You quote me as saying,
<Q>Is the present frame of human nature such, so totally <HI>inverted</HI> that God is ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed as being thus excel∣lent and morally perfect? Are righteousness, equity, goodness, kindness, &amp;c. <HI>hateful</HI> in <HI>our view</HI> of them, till we are new made? If so, doubtless we <HI>naturally approve</HI> the contrary vices; they are <HI>beautiful, excellent,</HI> and <HI>amiable</HI> characters, in our view of them, (D. p 16) To this you answer, '<HI>Doubtless this is true.</HI> What absurdity then is this? Do not unregenerate men <HI>view</HI> and <HI>taste</HI> a <HI>beauty, amiableness</HI> and <HI>sweetness</HI> in these contrary vi∣ces? Do they not roll iniquity as a sweet morsel under their tongue? Do they not take pleasure in unrighteousness?</Q>
(p 70) Yes Doctor, they sometimes do, <HI>for the sake of the profit</HI> and <HI>ad∣vantage</HI> they make by it for the gratification of their lusts; as Balaam ran <HI>greedily</HI> after the <HI>wages</HI> of unrighteousness. But they never take pleasure in it for its own sake, as what is, in its own nature, <HI>beautiful, amiable</HI> and <HI>sweet,</HI> in their view and taste of it. Vicious men's love of unrighteousness, like their hatred to righteousness, is an <HI>interested, partial</HI> affection, and directly in∣consistent with their natural, <HI>moral</HI> sense or taste; which pro∣nounces these things evil, and worthy to be hated. Doctor, you discover very wrong notions of moral nature, and talk as one that has never made any observations on human nature, as discovered in life, but has taken up his notions of it only from imagination and arbitrary conjecture, just as the old philosophers did their philosophic doctrines. Doctor, I am deceived in you. I really thought my questions, and the inference from the affirmation of them, would have stumbled you: I am half discouraged about you, and should be wholly, but that I consider you wrote this in the heat of your spirit; so I hope now you are calm, you will give a wiser answer.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="29" REF="012066_0015_0F899392F28C8958"/>VII. Doctor, I observe you here and there touch upon the doctrine of total depravity, and say, that I sometimes seem to own the doctrine, and at other times to deny it. The contro∣versy I had against you, in my dialogue, respected the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>source</HI> of the enmity of vicious beings against God, not the extent of moral corruption: so I said nothing particularly upon this, as I remember. The subject did not lead me to it, or at least, I did not apprehend that it did. In my letter to Mr. Hopkins p 5, 6, note, I stated what I apprehended to be the sentiments of the most moderate Calvinists relating to the general doctrine of total corruption and declared my agreement therein. I believe I have said nothing, either in the dialogue or letter, so determinate rela∣ting to my thoughts upon that subject. My words are these, viz.
<Q>The most moderate believe that the grand principle of true piety, and heavenly virtue is <HI>dead,</HI> and its <HI>root</HI></Q>
(by which I mean the true knowlege and love of God)

(not <HI>without</HI> the <HI>word of truth.</HI> Doctor, as you teach; God forbid that I should say so)
<Q>and that there are certain <HI>seeds of sin</HI> in the hearts of <HI>all men,</HI> or natural principles and springs of action, which, left to themselves, uncontrouled and ungoverned <HI>by grace</HI> will <HI>infallibly</HI> produce actual sin, and bring forth fruit unto death, and that some or other of the passions or lusts of sin have, in fact the <HI>ascendant</HI> in <HI>every heart</HI> of man till the heavenly seed of virtue or true holiness is planted by the spirit of grace. <HI>All this is undoubtedly true.</HI></Q>
—This, Doctor, is my belief: you may receive it upon the testimony of an honest man. Whether you will call it a belief of total, or partial corruption, little concerns me.</P>
<P>I observe you tell your readers that in my letter to Mr. Hopkins I discover a great concern to be thought a Calvinist. Some o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Doctor, have tho't I shew'd a good deal of indifference what you call me. I should chuse indeed to have my sentiments tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> represented by gentlemen who undertake to tell the churches who I believe and teach. If they would do me this justice they might give them what name they please. No honest man will desire greater liberty than this.</P>
<P>Doctor, you express a desire to know what I mean by <HI>moral</HI> corruption. I mean by it a disorder o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> irregularity in the ten∣dency, direction and exercise of the moral faculties and passions,
<PB N="30" REF="012066_0016_0F8993949553E660"/>
which is <HI>justly chargeable on the agent as his fault,</HI> his misuse or abuse of the moral powers and passions God has planted in his nature, or deviation from the moral law which is adapted to mo∣ral nature as the rule to which its motions and exercises ought of night to be conformed.—As you represent the matter, the fundamental fault or disorder of human nature <HI>is not of the moral kind</HI> If a man, thro' some wrongness or defect in his natural re∣lish, can't taste any agreeable sweetness in honey, but loaths it, this is no fault in him, and a law requiring him to be pleased with its taste, would be a very unjust and immoral law. And if human nature is so framed that men have naturally no <HI>capacity</HI> of <HI>seeing</HI> any moral excellence, or of <HI>tasting</HI> any thing amiable and worthy of esteem and honor in God's character, and in moral truth, be the mind ever so much inlightened, but these objects appear ug∣ly and <HI>hateful in themselves</HI>; this is not a moral corruption, for which the man is blameable, but a physical wrongness in the na∣tural constitution of human nature. Your doctrine says this is the character of human nature. You say,
<Q>Unregenerate men <HI>can't</HI> see God's beauty and excellency—they do not see the beauty and excellency of God's perfections—unregenerate men can <HI>never</HI> see this, (i. e. as I suppose you mean, in any degree, thro' any inlightning they are capable of, till after they are new made by a physical operation upon them, without the word of truth.</Q>
You add)
<Q>They may, and often do <HI>see</HI> those perfections that compose that character that is beautiful <HI>in itself,</HI> such as his power, righteousness, &amp;c.—They see the <HI>true character</HI> of God,</Q>
(i. e. if I understand you, they see him to be most wise, righteous, true, faithful, good, merciful,) 'but they see no beauty in him,' (i. e. no moral excellence in these perfections of God)
<Q>for that which renders him beautiful to all holy beings, even that is the object of their hatred; and if so, then the beauty of God's cha∣racter is the thing they hate, (p. 69, note)</Q>
That is, as you most be understood, they see the wisdom, righteousness, truth, goodness and compassionate good will of God to be what the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are; they see him to be most wise, equitable, true, good and gra∣cious, and <HI>as such</HI> they <HI>hate</HI> him, for these are <HI>hateful things</HI> in their view, and taste bitter as gall, and are their abomination. If God appeared to them under the character of a foolish, false, un∣just, cruel tyrant, they would love him and esteem him very beautiful, and full of excellency, and adore him, and exalt his name with praise. Whence is this, Doctor? You say such a false taste and monstrous hatred is interwove in the very frame of the heart of man, ever since the fall. Doctor, I must tell you again,
<PB N="31" REF="012066_0016_0F8993949553E660"/>
you make man look much worse than a devil —But let us hear you further. You say, p. 70, note,
<Q>No excellency, <HI>viewed as such,</HI> ever was, or can be hated: but then <HI>I</HI> AFFIRM human nature is <HI>so totally inverted,</HI> that it can discern no moral excel∣lency in God,—till it is renewed; and if ever the unrenewed sinner <HI>sees</HI> any beauty in <HI>a God,</HI> it is in <HI>one formed</HI> to <HI>suit</HI> his own <HI>depraved taste,</HI> and not in the true God.</Q>
This is such a total inversion of human nature as <HI>wholly destroys</HI> its character <HI>as moral.</HI> If your account of human nature is true, its corruption is not of the moral kind; and men are under a <HI>natural, physical</HI> impossibility of loving God, or ceasing to hate him, till their hearts are physi∣cally changed, and endowed with a new moral faculty or taste, which is now wanting. These hints are more enlarged upon in my piece in answer to Mr. Edwards on the nature of virtue.— Doctor, I am sorry to see your understanding so <HI>inverted,</HI> and your tho'ts so confounded as that you mistake darkness for light. By your doctrine you subvert the foundation and obligation of natu∣ral religion, so far as natural men have any concern therein. And the kingdom of God, or gospel dispensation, according to your doctrine, is as a man who made a great feast of sugar'd and honey'd things, and sent forth his servants to invite and bring in to his feast, all his vassals, who, thro' some fault in the natural construction of their organs of taste, known to him, and wholly incurable by them, hate and abhor these things, requiring them to taste his provisions with good relish and delight; and because they nauseate, and so refuse to eat them, he sends forth his army and destroys them all, as a company of ungrateful, rebellious miscreants; except a few, whom he miraculously works a phy∣sical change upon, giving them a new gust. You will say the cases are not similar, because the sinner's antipathy is of his heart or will. But remember, 'tis, according to you, a natural, inwro't, incurable antipathy to things morally good, <HI>as such</HI>; a natural, essential wrongness &amp; inversion of the moral taste, incurable, but by God's physical power. There is no moral faultiness in either: The cases are similar.—Doctor, I can't endure that abominable blasphemy against the gospel of God which is the necessary result of your doctrines. I wonder you don't see it: I hope you will by the time you have read, and thoroughly weighed all that I write to you, and make no delay to renounce them with just ab∣horrence, and cast them to the moles and to the bats.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I said, D. p. 45.
<Q>Human nature is so weakened and cor∣rupted since the fall, that men neither will nor can so believe and <HI>realize</HI> gospel truth, as to be renewed by its influence, unless the Spirit of truth accompany the word and speak it, as it were, to the heart, and impress it by his powerful energy.</Q>
You say this doctrine is as liable to the charge of consequential blasphemy against God and the gospel of Jesus Christ, as yours; and that yours can be vindicated from this charge as easily and fully as mine, p 110, 111.—Doctor, you labour under a very great mistake in this. The gospel is a ministration of supernatural truth and grace, fitted in its nature to work in the mind as a vital seed, and sacred leaven; and the mind of man is naturally capa∣ble of being influenced and changed or spiritualized by it, when firmly believed and realized. The holy Spirit of God accompa∣nies this ministration of the word of life, with some degree of his influence, <HI>as a common grace</HI> If sinners improve this, and the outward helps they have by the gospel, as far as they are impro∣vable by them I <HI>believe</HI> he will crown his common influence with special and effectual, leading them on to saving faith, and so re∣generate them: If they do not, but continually resist and rebel against the motions of the Spirit, and so provoke God to with∣draw his Spirit and give them up to final blindness and hardness of heart, the grace of the gospel is vindicated, and they perish as despisers of it. This belief is consistent with my doctrine above.</NOTE> Don't
<PB N="32" REF="012066_0017_0F8993953714E420"/>
you remember the words of the apostle, (Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6.) <HI>Those who have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</HI> (i. e. of the gospel dispensation) <HI>if they shall fall away,</HI> &amp;c. implying that a man may have an approving moral taste of the truth and moral excellency of the gospel, in some degree, though his heart is not thoroughly attached to it.—But I think you may be convinced out of your own mouth. You say (p. 75)
<Q>Mr. H. and I agree in this, That there is in all moral beings <HI>as such,</HI> a faculty of distinguishing between moral good and evil.</Q>
— Surely you don't mean a faculty of discerning moral good to be right and righteous, and that <HI>for this very reason</HI> it appears to men an ugly and hateful object; and a faculty of discerning mo∣ral evil to be wrong and unrighteous, and that, viewing it in this true light, men naturally esteem it a beautiful, amiable object, and love it as such. This is not a faculty of distinguishing, but of inverting and confounding moral good and evil. At this rate you make the faculty of distinguishing moral good and evil a perfect magic glass, which shews objects inverted and distorted; and represent the moral nature of man, as <HI>bewitched,</HI> as much as the children of the scarlet whore are, by her witchcrafts and sorce∣ries
<PB N="33" REF="012066_0017_0F8993953714E420"/>
practised upon them—Doubtless you mean here Doctor, to agree with me in acknowleging that by this moral faculty, the mind of man, discerning a real difference between moral good and evil, perceives the one to be <HI>right, amiable,</HI> and <HI>worthy</HI> of <HI>esteem</HI> and <HI>honor,</HI> and the other <HI>wrong worthy</HI> of <HI>moral h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed</HI> and <HI>blame.</HI> You should lay this as your foundation principle and reject all your imaginations which don't agree with it, if you would be a good moral philosopher, metaphy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cian o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> divine. It is every where taken for granted in the holy scriptures.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. You quote me as saying.
<Q>No man ever and speak evil of God's ways, viewing them as they truly are, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> equitable and good.</Q>
Upon this you say,
<Q>If he meant seeing their beauty, I readily own i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></Q>
(p 132.) I mean, Doctor, seeing them to be <HI>equitable</HI> and <HI>good.</HI> This is not what raises the sinner's hatred to them, but his perceiving their opposition to his lusts, which he refuses to give up; and because he can't but approve them, as viewed in this light, he perversely misrepresents them <HI>as unequal,</HI> that he may with some colour vent the malignity of his heart in speaking evil of them —As to <HI>beauty</HI> the <HI>moral beauty</HI> or <HI>excellen∣cy</HI> of equity consists in its equitableness, the beauty of goodness in its goodness, the beauty of justice in its justness, of wisdom in its prudence, so of all other moral perfections. Their moral excellency consists in their being what they are. The beauty or moral excellency of God's character consists in, or is the result of all moral and mental perfections, as united in him, and most har∣moniously exercised, <HI>all as one.</HI> This collection of moral and mental beauties, all in the highest perfection of their nature, forms a character, whose light and glory fill the universe, and is the wonder and joy of all the sons of wisdom, in all worlds. <HI>Honor and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.</HI></P>
<P>But you. Doctor, give us no distinct Ideas of what you mean by moral beauty, and the moral excellency of God's character: perhaps you have none. You doubtless mean something wholly of a different kind from that kind of beauty I mentioned above: for you say, men may see those perfections that compose that cha∣racter that is beautiful in itself, yea, see <HI>that very character</HI> of God which is the perfection of beauty, and yet not see its beauty, nor have the least glimpse or idea of its true moral excellency. And all your writers talk in the same strain. This, Doctor, is a downright contradiction: and you have no way to escape but by essentially changing the idea of moral beauty, and introducing a new and imaginary notion of moral excellency, and placing vir∣tue on a false foundation. This is what Mr. Edwards has done
<PB N="34" REF="012066_0018_0F899395F6EC4998"/>
in his dissertation on the nature of true virtue. Doubtless you have adopted his distinction between the <HI>primary</HI> and <HI>secondary</HI> beauty of moral things and characters. The beauty I spake of above, I suppose you would call after him,
<Q>a <HI>secondary</HI> beauty, altogether of the same kind with the beauty of a chess board, or piece of beautifully slower'd chints or brocade,</Q>
which, consider<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d simply in itself, has nothing of the nature of true virtue and mo∣ral beauty in it, any more than those things have; and that you would say, all moral excellency, or true moral beauty consists in what he calls the <HI>primary</HI> beauty of moral things, which is intire∣ly of a different nature or kind, and which no unregenerate man can see, which the moral sense can't taste, and has no relish for.</P>
<P>This I suppose to be your secret meaning; tho' for some reason or other, you don't clearly explain yourselves. This is the key which explains your mysterious talk about seeing the perfections and character of God without discerning any thing of their moral beauty or excellency. But I don't enlarge here, having parti∣cularly examined these notions, and shewn them to be arbitrary and false, in my remarks on that piece of Mr. Edwards's.</P>
<P>You say, Doctor,
<Q>a perception of beauty is love, or <HI>necessarily</HI> engages it.</Q>
No, it necessarily engages the mind to approve the object as amiable and <HI>worthy</HI> to be loved. Indeed the perception of the moral beauty of God's character may be so full, clear and realizing as to draw the heart off from all its adulterous loves, and fix it on God. He can give such a sense. But the views men generally have of God's moral excellency and glory, are so imperfect, obscure and unrealizing, that they don't draw the heart to the choice of him, in preference to all other objects of desire.</P>
<P N="9">IX. In your seventh sect. Doctor, I observe you endeavor to persuade your readers that my scheme of doctrines agrees with Mr. Sandeman's. If I was to take the same liberty in altering your doctrines, as you do in respect to mine, I could make you appear to agree with the author of
<Q>Christianity not founded on argument.</Q>
I need not pervert some of them half so much as you do mine, to give such an appearance. 'Tis an avowed and leading principle in your scheme, that the moral change of the heart is not founded on argument, nor effected by any influence of gospel light and truth upon either the understanding or will. But if I should spend five or six pages in making out this agree∣ment, you would think it but an ungracious business. You ought to think your own so.—Your scheme nearly agrees with San∣deman's, in many things, tho' you differ from him in some. For
<PB N="35" REF="012066_0018_0F899395F6EC4998"/>
this reason I sometimes loosely called your scheme <HI>Sandemanian,</HI> as it then had no distinguishing name. But as it has since gain'd the name of <HI>Hopkintonian,</HI> which is more proper, I am content that the other should be no more applied.</P>
<P>You say,
<Q>In support of his (Mr <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s) notion he quotes these words, <HI>We love him because he first loved us.</HI> This, he thinks, proves that when the sinner sees God's character, not only as amiable in itself,—but also how it bears a be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign aspect on his happiness, then he will love God to good purpose. <HI>Sandeman's scheme to perfection,</HI> who says, <HI>the gospel reconciles men to the</HI> just <HI>God, by shewing him to be a</HI> SAVIOUR.</Q>
p. 124. I should not have taken any notice of this, had you not hereby thrown infa∣mous contempt on the gospel of Jesus Christ. Every reader will see at once, that you treat the sentiments you offer as mine and Sandeman's with <HI>contempt.</HI> In this you have <HI>despised not man but God</HI> You might as well have cried out, The gospel scheme to perfection. This tho't, The gospel reconciles men to the <HI>just</HI> God, by shewing him to be a <HI>saviour,</HI> runs thro' the whole gospel, and is its distinguishing glory, and that which merits and gives it the name of gospel or good news. It was a manifestation and sight of the <HI>just</HI> God as a SAVIOUR that revived the despairing hearts of your poor first parents, and reconciled them to God, and melted their hearts into filial repentance. But for this, you, if you had ever seen the light of life, would have been a <HI>poor, for∣saken, miserable</HI> wretch It was by shewing the just God a savi∣our that the apostles of Jesus Christ ministerially reconciled the world. This is their voice which crieth in city and country, and thro' the world <HI>God was, in Christ, reconciling the world unto him∣self, not imputing their trespasses unto them — Now then—We beseech you, in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled unto God: for he hath made him sin for us—that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</HI> Every sinner that ever was, is, or shall be reconciled to God, is reconciled by seeing the just God <HI>a saviour.</HI> Doctor, I readily agree with you, and Sandeman too, wherein you agree with the truth; for I have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>with respect to persons,</HI> but to the truth. But I am very far from ap∣proving either your scheme or his; for both run wide of the line of truth. The father of error knows how to turn both to his advantage.</P>
<P N="10">X. In your 8th section, Doctor, you endeavor to prove by a number of quotations from old writers, that your divinity is not <HI>new.</HI> I never tho't or said that all the doctrines you gentlemen, in the <HI>new</HI> scheme teach, are <HI>new</HI>; but some of them are. Mr.

On this you say.
<Q>If this is true it follows, either (1) that the Westminster assembly of divines, and others I have quoted, were not Calvinists or (2) did not understand themselves.</Q>

taught the doctrine you represent as the doctrine of the <HI>runaways.</HI> Speaking of the inward teaching of the holy Spirit, accompanying the outward teaching by the word, and rendering that effectual, he says,
<Q>In vain should the light shew itself to the blind, unless the same spirit <HI>of understanding</HI> should open the eyes of their mind: so as a man may rightly call the Holy Spirit the <HI>key</HI> by which the treasures of the heavenly kingdom are opened unto us; and may call his enlightning the eye sight of our mind to see. Therefore doth Paul so much commend the ministry of the Spirit, because teachers should cry without profiting, unless Christ himself, the <HI>inward</HI> master, should draw them by his Spirit.—Therefore, as we have said that perfect salvation is found in the person of Christ; so, that we may be made parta∣kers thereof, he do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h baptize us in the holy Spirit—<HI>lightening us into the faith of his gospel</HI> and SO NEW BEGETTING US, <HI>that we may renew creatures.</HI></Q>

(ibid. ch. 3 art. 1.) By repentance, here, he tells us he means to include regeneration, or the renewal of the heart after the image of God, as well as the consequent change of life. After discoursing upon this some time, he says, in the 9th article of this chap
<Q>In one word, I expound repentance to be <HI>regeneration,</HI> which hath no other mark whereunto it is directed, but that the image of God, which was, by Adam's offence, <HI>foully defaced,</HI> and <HI>in a manner wholly blotted out,</HI> may be <HI>renewed</HI> in us. So the apostle teacheth when he saith, But we representing</Q>

<P>You mention Van Mastricht as one who justifies your new doc∣trines. I have seen the extracts from him lately published <HI>He clearly condemns you,</HI> Doctor. He says,
<Q>Regeneration is a second and spiritual generation, in which the soul receives spiritual life. The father in this case is God—the <HI>seed</HI> is the <HI>word of God</HI>— received by the external call of the Gospel,</Q>
(p. 17) Doctor, you say this seed, thus received into the mind of the unregenerate, only inflames enmity against God; that this change is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought without any influence of gospel truth upon the heart. In this, you see your witness <HI>condemns</HI> you. Doctor, can this word be the generating seed of the new creature, and yet the generator make no use of it, not apply it at all to the heart, in the genera∣ting act? Mastricht also says,
<Q>This spiritual life, which he calls the <HI>immediate effect</HI> of the generating act, animates the whole man, and all the several parts and faculties of him. — As it takes place in the <HI>understanding,</HI> it is called—spiritual <HI>light,</HI> and the bestowment of it <HI>by regeneration,</HI> is called <HI>illumination</HI>;— which light begets in them the <HI>saving</HI> knowlege of God and the Me∣diator,</Q>
(p 25) This, Doctor, is wholly inconsistent with your <HI>new</HI> doctrine, which says, regeneration is wro't <HI>without light,</HI> and <HI>before</HI> saving illumination. In this you are condemned by the scriptures and condemned by these old writers, to whom you now appeal.</P>
<P>You Gentlemen, by the many quotations you have heaped up∣on us, from former writers, have gained two things; first, a proof that some great and good men before you have tho't obscure∣ly, and talked inconsistently, as you also do. Secondly, That those who approached nearest to you in doctrine, retained so much truth as clearly to condemn your leading doctrines, and themselves too, wherein they seem to favor you.—So that, upon the whole, I think, Doctor, you must be content to bear the glory of having
<PB N="39" REF="012066_0020_0F8993977579FCB8"/>
made some <HI>new discoveries,</HI> and '<HI>further improvements</HI> in Calvinism.' But whence is it that all the errors you <HI>run</HI> into are <HI>sound Calvin∣ism,</HI> and all the truths which <HI>let</HI> or withstand them, are <HI>Armini∣anism?</HI></P>
<P N="11">XI. Doctor, I observe that tho' you sometimes tell your rea∣ders what I must mean by the <HI>moral power of the Spirit, moral</HI> force, energy, influence, yet at other times you profess yourself at a loss, and demand of me what I mean by these and such like phrases. Some others, I perceive, have been in doubt here.— To satisfy you and them, I will tell you in a few words By moral power, force, &amp;c. I intend that kind of influence upon the mind, which is <HI>fitted, in its nature,</HI> to produce the designed <HI>moral</HI> effects or changes, motions or actions in the mind, as a moral agent. This, you will say, is too general: I will explain, only take the ideas already suggested, right.—There is a <HI>power</HI> in <HI>strong</HI> delusions, an <HI>efficacy</HI> and <HI>energy</HI> in the spirit of error upon minds prepared to receive it: but it is not of the <HI>physical</HI> kind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Thes. 2.9—11.</NOTE> And there is a divine <HI>power</HI> in sacred truth, and a <HI>mighty</HI> acting <HI>force</HI> and <HI>energy</HI> in divine beauty and love, as applying themselves to, or exerting their power upon the mind. 'Love is <HI>strong</HI> as 'death.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cant. 8.6.</NOTE> 'The love of Christ <HI>constraineth</HI> us.' <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 5.14.</NOTE> This power and strength and constraining force is of the <HI>moral</HI> kind, adapted in its nature to influence moral agents.</P>
<P>I will now consider the <HI>moral</HI> power and energy of the holy Spirit, exerted in morally changing and turning the heart of the sinner from his sin unto God, or regenerating him. He applies himself to him, for this purpose, in a manner suited to his nature as a <HI>moral</HI> being: He presents the quickning truth
<Q>to the view of the understanding, or perceiving faculty,</Q>
and holds it so be∣fore the eye of the mind, and impresses the object with such force, as awakens and fixes the attention of the mind and by his inward teaching and influence, causes the mind to see the object as it is, as a real, existing thing, not as an imagination or mere probability, and as vastly great, excellent, interesting and impor∣tant. The truth, or object, thus presented to the view of the understanding, and <HI>entered into the mind</HI> by the Spirit of God, is now <HI>felt</HI> by the mind in its <HI>true weight,</HI> and exer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s its <HI>moral,</HI> con∣straining force upon the heart; and being seen and sensed as so infinitely superior, every way, to all contrary objects, it sweetly and <HI>powerfully</HI> commands the choice of the will, attracts and fixes the love of the heart, and engages all the <HI>moral passions.</HI> The mind and heart is now <HI>morally changed,</HI> by a <HI>moral</HI> power, opera∣tion
<PB N="40" REF="012066_0021_0F899398357BAA68"/>
and energy of the Spirit and truth of God —I know, Doctor, what you are now objecting about <HI>moral su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion,</HI> unless your present tho'ts are clearer and juster than they were when you wrote against me: but carry your tho'ts a little further, first. —What is this quickening truth, this attracting object, which, by the ministry of the holy Spirit, is thus bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to the view of the mind, and entered into the heart, and so holly and happily cap∣tivates it? It is God revealed to sinners in Christ, and reconci∣ling them to himself by him. And wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n he vouchsafes to make himself thus present to the mind, by his Spirit he does reconci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and draw the heart to himself: He is in Christ our center; and now his divine, moral, <HI>attracting</HI> force is exerted upon the mind, <HI>felt,</HI> and <HI>answered</HI> by a returning <HI>moral</HI> motion, tendency and earnest attraction of the heart towards him —Doctor you are hunting about in the dark after some latent principle or spring of this motion or attraction of the heart to God As an unknown substratum of all these new and holy motions or actings of the soul; and pretend this is first formed by a <HI>creating physical</HI> act: but <HI>this unknown something, is really nothing.</HI> The soul, as a moral being, is naturally capable of feeling the impression of God upon it, of being attracted by him, and answering this <HI>felt</HI> attraction, by an attraction to him. Gods attracting force <HI>impressed</HI> and <HI>felt,</HI> is the thing that puts the mind in motion t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nding to him, and controuls and stops its contrary motions to evil objects. In this way he causes this first beginning motion of the heart towards him; which is the <HI>beginning of holiness</HI> in man. You are as un∣philosophical in your notion of a new, holy principle in the heart, prior to the first holy motion of the heart towards God, and as the imagined cause or secret spring of this first motion, as you would be if you should say, there must be a new principle of par∣ticular motion put into bodies, before any force exerted upon them can put them in such motion, or alter the direction of their former motion and reverse it.</P>
<P>Doctor, to talk of a moral change, wro't by a physical operati∣on, as <HI>preceeding</HI> all this, and preparing the heart to be influenced by the truth and presence of God in the mind, as you gentlemen do, is to tell of a moral change <HI>preceeding itself,</HI> or of a moral change which leaves the <HI>understanding, will</HI> and <HI>moral passions un∣changed, unaffected</HI> not <HI>touched</HI> or <HI>moved</HI> at all; which is no <HI>moral</HI> change. Motives presented to the view of the mind, Mr. Ed∣wards says, are what move the will, and that without the influ∣ence of motives, the will can't act or chuse any thing, one way of another. A physical operation, without presenting any object of
<PB N="41" REF="012066_0021_0F899398357BAA68"/>
motive to holy volition, to the view of the mind, can't then pro∣duce a moral change in the heart, or give a new, holy turn and disposition to the will and moral passions, any more than motives, or moral force can wind up a watch that is run down, and give it new motion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I observe, Doctor, you say,
<Q>Mr. H. makes faith preceed re∣generation, and an <HI>efficient cause</HI> of it; or, at least, he supposes it makes men <HI>fit subjects of it.</HI></Q>
p. 140. Neither of the two: you had no warrant to say so. But you was here endeavoring to persuade your reader that my principles agree with Mr. Sande∣man's: and it was necessary that you should say things that look that way, tho' I did not. You say again, p 162,
<Q>He ascribes faith to the <HI>unregenerate.</HI></Q>
If you mean that they may have <HI>saving</HI> faith and yet <HI>remain</HI> unregenerate, you bear false witness I neither believe this, nor your contrary doctrine, that a man may be regenerate and yet have <HI>no faith,</HI> for some time after it. Faith preceeds regeneration in the same sense as a man's entering by the door (Christ is the door) preceeds his being in the fold among the sheep, and one of them.—You also say, It is my opinion,
<Q><HI>that</HI> regeneration is effected by objective light,</Q>
p. 128, and
<Q><HI>by</HI> moral suasion.</Q>
I used neither of these phrases. I don't very well like them: they are become of doubtful signification to most readers, by being used in different senses.</NOTE></P>
<P>I must take a little notice of one thing more, before I dismiss this subject. I observed in the dialogu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> (p. 45, note) that
<Q>power may be distinguished into two kinds, <HI>physical</HI> and <HI>moral,</HI> that the Spirit of God is possessed of both, and exerts the one or the other, as he wills to produce a change of the moral or physical kind</Q>
Upon this you say,
<Q>Did ever any one besides Mr. H. <HI>imagine that the same almighty power could not produce effects of entirely different natures?</HI></Q>
(No, Doctor, nor he neither.
<Q>Did not the same power produce fire and water, the souls and bodies of men?</Q>
(p. 135) Yes, Doctor, it did. But what is all this to the purpose? These are, none of them, effects of the moral kind, in the sense of the phrase as I used it. And besides, you mistake about the distinction of power, into moral and physical. The distinction don't lie in the degrees of strength. Both are almighty, as in God; and have, when he pleases to exert them fully, an irresistable force. But the distinction consists in this, Gods moral power, in act, is his exertion of the force of moral truth upon moral beings, upon their moral faculties, giving mo∣tion to them, or springing them into such right, moral action as God wills or commands in his law. These moral faculties are
<PB N="42" REF="012066_0022_0F899398F3709C10"/>
fitted, by the original constitution of intelligent minds or moral ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, to be thus acted upon, influenced and put in motion or action, by God's exertion of this kind of power or force upon them —By physical power, as distinguished from what I call mo∣ral I mean that kind of exertion of the powerful will of God, whereby he produces the designed effects, without any commu∣nication and impression of the light and force of truth upon the object I don't know, Doctor, whether I express myself with strict propriety; but I hope you take my ideas. And is there not a foundation, in the nature of things, for such a kind of distincti∣on? Does God give motion to the heavenly bodies, and direct and govern their motions, by the same kind of influence and operation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> force exerted upon them, as that by which he com∣municates moral motion to the minds of his holy angels, and di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ects, influences and governs their moral and holy actions and exercises? Does he manifest his glory and beauty to the sun, and give it to <HI>know</HI> his will, and thereby touch an <HI>inward moral spring,</HI> and so cause it to rejoice, <HI>with understanding,</HI> to run its race, and know the time of its rising and going down? A stream of water falling upon the water wheel, with a degree of force superior to the resistence, will set the mill in motion: and a stream of gospel light stowing from the fountain of light, and falling upon the mind of a sinner, with a degree of force superior to his resistence, will powerfully compel him to believe; and a blaze of moral beauty, and flow of divine love into his heart, made manifest by the light which shines within him, will powerfully draw she heart to God, and kindle the sire of sacred love to him. Is the force exerted upon the mill, of the same kind with that ex∣erted upon the moral being? Doctor, do you exert the same kind of power or force in giving motion to a ball, as in commu∣nicating motion to the mind, will and passions of a man? The common people understand the distinction well enough, tho' per∣haps their ideas are not connected with the terms I used to ex∣press it. Nothing is more familiar with them than such expres∣sions as these; a strong man, a man of a strong arm strong argu∣ments, strong reasonings; such a man preaches powerfully, ano∣ther fights powerfully They know how to distinguish here, two different kinds of power, strength and action I wonder, Doctor, you was at a loss You say, I wish Mr H. would tell
<Q>us what he means by the moral power of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Spirit, &amp;c. This phrase, to me, appears quite unintelligible and to be words without ideas.</Q>
(p 134, 135. note.) Perhaps I did not suffi∣ciently explain myself; but I tho't you would have understood me. The ideas I communicated relating to these matters, appear
<PB N="43" REF="012066_0022_0F899398F3709C10"/>
to have been <HI>new</HI> to you, and so you did not clearly apprehend them, and imagined I had no clearer ideas of these things than you received in reading the dialogue. It was with you, as with the man whose eyes were partly opened; <HI>he saw man as trees walking</HI> I hope. Sir, you see these things in a clear light now.</P>
<P N="12">XII. I observe, Doctor, you begin to adopt m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doctrine con∣cerning the nature and source of the sinners enmity to God and righteousness. You say, (p. 99) 'Enmity' (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of sinners against God)
<Q>is not the <HI>less wicked</HI> and hateful, <HI>because</HI> it is <HI>interested</HI> and <HI>partial</HI>; for its wickedness <HI>lies in its being so.</HI> I can conceive of no <HI>wicked</HI> enmity, but such as is <HI>interested.</HI> Such was the en∣mity of Cain to Abel; of Esau to Jacob; of Saul to David: and <HI>for this reason</HI> it was <HI>very wicked.</HI></Q>
You add,
<Q><HI>and</HI> because selfshness is innate, therefore this enmity is so too.</Q>
(This last clause I may consider presently) In the preceeding you assert the same doctrine that I advanced relating to this enmity; only you insinuate to your re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ders that your notion is essentially diffe∣rent from mine, <HI>in this,</HI> that you make the <HI>wickedness</HI> of this en∣mity to <HI>consist</HI> in its being <HI>interested</HI> and <HI>partial,</HI> whereas I consi∣dered <HI>this</HI> as an <HI>extenuation</HI> of its faultiness. And this you ex∣presly assert, p 91, where you say.
<Q>He (Mr H) would have the sinner know that he is <HI>not chargeable</HI> with any <HI>great fault</HI> on account of this enmity. He calls it, <HI>by way of extenuation,</HI> an <HI>interested, partial</HI> affection, an <HI>unnatural</HI> passion that does violence to the moral sense planted in the mind by the hand of the Crea∣tor.</Q>
You here refer to p 57, 58 D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for your justification: but it wholly condemns you These are my words, p 58.
<Q>This enmity to God is an <HI>interested, unnatural</HI> passion, and does violence to the <HI>moral sense</HI> planted in the mind by the hand of the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eator; and <HI>herein l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es the great malignity of wilful sin.</HI></Q>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the sinner's wilfully sinning against his conscience or mo∣ral sense of what is right, for the sake of his lusts —What you tell your readers is in direct opposition to what I said; it is an abso∣lute falshood. I think you could not but know it to be so; for you quoted the words immediately preceeding this clause and certainly you have sense enough to see the opposition between your proposition and mine: It is a very injurious falshood — I could mention a great number of instances wherein you are guilty of the same kind of sin. You seem, Doctor to have set yourself down to defame your brother as much as you could, and to have founded your piece against me upon this maxim of the worst policy, 'Throw dirt plentifully, some will stick.' By this method of defence, you confess your cause bad. Error can only
<PB N="44" REF="012066_0023_0F899399B59F14D0"/>
be defended by falshood and misrepresentation. You certainly harkened to very bad advice and wrote under a very evil influ∣ence. I advise you to confess with David—When you do, I desire you may hear the same reviving answer.</P>
<P>Now, Doctor, a word or two upon the last clause quoted above, viz.
<Q>And because selfishness is <HI>innate,</HI> therefore this enmity is so too.</Q>
In this you make this enmity, not a <HI>primary</HI> or <HI>original</HI> passion of human nature, but a <HI>secondary</HI> passion only, a <HI>conse∣quence</HI> and <HI>result</HI> of one particular wrong affection, <HI>selfishness</HI>; you make it so in the order of nature at least.</P>
<P>By <HI>selfishness,</HI> I suppose, Doctor, you mean more than self-love, or a general desire of our own good and happiness. I presume you mean by it a vicious and irregular direction and exercise of the natural passion of love to ourselves or desire of our own good; a setting up self as the supreme object of our regard, sub∣ordinating God's interest and honor to self, and such a foolish re∣gard to little self as disposes to trample upon truth, equity and honor, for the sake of little and false self interests. If this is what you mean by <HI>selfishness,</HI> it is a very vicious passion; and enmity to those persons and things that stand in its way, very easily and naturally arises out of it. And when this monster is provoked, he lays about him with fury: no weapon comes amiss to him by which he may offend the objects of his hatred, and defend and avenge <HI>dear self.</HI> Hence come wars and fightings, reviling, lying, cursing, blasphemy, or giving false and injurious characters. This was the true source of all the malicious falshoods spoken against our Saviour and his apostles. And he foretells that the same spirit which called the master of the house B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bub will call those of his houshold so.— But you are mistaken. Doctor, if you think all this <HI>innate.</HI> The general passion, or principle of self love or desire of our own good is indeed so. But this, in it∣self, simply considered, is not evil; the wrong direction, and ir∣regular and excessive motions of it, only are so. This is the effect of the wrong ideas and imaginations we receive, and the wrong judgments we make concerning ourselves and our own good and interest after we come upon the stage. Indeed, if man is left to himself he will infallibly be misled his natural p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssions will take a wrong direction, and fix on wrong objects: he will be corrupt, wicked and miserable. Nothing but the teaching, spirit and grace of God can prevent this, and guide the young creature right, and give a right direction to the natural passions, and fix them on their proper objects.</P>
<P>You say (p. 108)
<Q>Surely Mr. H. never read the best writers
<PB N="45" REF="012066_0023_0F899399B59F14D0"/>
on ethics. I beg leave to recommend Edwards on the will.</Q>
—Doctor, your advice comes too late. I read that book many years ago, and have re-examined it lately. There are some good things in it, and some very wrong. I have made some remarks upon it, shewing the falshood, and destructive tendency of some of his doctrines. You may publish this, with the other, if you please, it may possibly enlighten you a little.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. In your postscript, Doctor, you take notice of my letter to Mr. Hopkins, and treat it as you did the dialogue, and by par∣tial quotations and wrong representations, attempt to deceive your readers, and to set the D and L. a quarrelling. I will give you two instances. You quote me as saying in the Letter,
<Q>Men who admit this doctrine</Q>
(i. e. of total depravity)
<Q>do and may very consistently deny <HI>your</HI> doctrine concerning the <HI>nature</HI> of the enmity. There is an essential difference between your doctrine concerning the nature of the enmity, and their doctrine of the corruption.</Q>
—On this you say,
<Q>But it seems that he ex∣pects us to believe this on his <HI>naked assertion</HI>; for he has been <HI>very careful not to shew wherein</HI> the distinction lies, unless we may gather it from these words;</Q>
<Q><HI>They</HI> (i e. all sound Calvinists) <HI>believe the corruption is of the moral kind.</HI> But this shews no difference; because—we believe the enmity we hold to be of the moral kind</Q>
(p. 160) Here, Doctor, you have played <HI>foul</HI> in a very <HI>scandalous</HI> manner You have designedly concealed from your reader the chief difference I mentioned between your doc∣trine concerning the <HI>nature</HI> of the enmity and their doctrine con∣cerning the corruption, and told him I mentioned no other diffe∣rence but what you quoted, knowing you did not speak true in this I here give the passage as it stands in my Letter, p. 7, and put the words you concealed, in Italics. Let the reader compare and judge for himself. 'Men who admit this doctrine' (of total depravity)
<Q>do, and may very consistently deny your doctrine concerning the nature of the enmity: <HI>for</HI> they believe the cor∣ruption is of the moral kind; <HI>and</HI> CURABLE <HI>by an application of that supernatural doctrine of truth and grace which came by Jesus Christ, in such a manner as the Spirit of God knows how to apply it.</HI> There is an essential difference between your doctrine concern∣ing the enmity—and their doctrine of the corruption.</Q>
— You know, Doctor, this difference, which you bid under a <HI>cover∣ing</HI> —is <HI>real</HI> and <HI>essential.</HI> You and Mr. Hopkins assert the direct contrary concerning the nature of your enmity, viz that <HI>it is not curable</HI> by any possible application of gospel truth to the mind. By concealing this mentioned difference, and telling your readers
<PB N="46" REF="012066_0024_0F89939BB2419DA8"/>
I have 'been very careful not to shew wherein the difference lies, 'except only by saying,
<Q>they believe the corruption is on a moral kind.</Q>
You have given them just cause to complain of you and say, 'thou hast unworthily deceived us.'</P>
<P>In my letter to Mr. Hopkins, I told him he had put the con∣troversy on a wrong foot in saying that total depravity is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the <HI>only thing in dispute</HI>; that what I opposed was your doctrine concerning the <HI>nature</HI> of the enmity—and gave this just summary of it, viz.
<Q>The enmity of man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s heart is levelled <HI>directly against God's whole moral character,</HI> as being hateful to the natural man, <HI>in itself</HI> or <HI>for its own sake;</HI> that this enmity is <HI>wro't into the very frame</HI> of the human heart, and is of such a nature, and so con∣firmed a principle that no <HI>possible</HI> applications of <HI>gospel truths</HI> to the mind and heart can <HI>subdue</HI> or <HI>weaken</HI> it: the Spirit of God himself can't overcome it by applying gospel truth and the doctrines of grace to the heart: But, on the contrary the more a natural man <HI>sees</HI> of the light and truth of God's character <HI>the more in proportion</HI> does his hatred of it rise and exert itself</Q>
— This doctrine I opposed in my dialogue, and did so effectually overthrow, that you and Mr Hopkins both have tho't it expedi∣ent to shift the controversy, and tell your readers the dispute is about the doctrine of total corruption. And you have underta∣ken to prove that you have stated the controversy right, and that I shamefully denied the truth of fact in telling Mr. Hopkins he had stated it wrong. Let us see how you do this.</P>
<P>Having quoted two passages from the dialogue, and made an impertinent remark, misrepresenting their sense, you add,
<Q>I could fill whole pages with quotations of this kind</Q>
(i e with quotations not at all to your purpose)
<Q>but shall only mention one more, where he <HI>expresly</HI> puts the controversy <HI>upon the foot of total depravity.</HI> Having quoted from my sermon the following words, viz. The minds of men are <HI>too full</HI> of enmity to be per∣suaded to love or be reconciled to God, by any, tho' the most powerful arguments; therefore I do not think that regene∣ration is effected by light,—but in order to this the power of God must be exerted, and by this alone men are created anew; he adds, <HI>if the premises are true, the inference is undoubtedly just.</HI> And yet in the face of all this—he te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls Mr Hopkins that it is an unwarrantable assertion to say, the controversy does, by his (Mr. H's) own acknowlegement, turn upon the doctrine of man's <HI>total</HI> corruption.</Q>
(p. 159) More <HI>soul play,</HI> Doctor, <HI>exceeding soul.</HI> What I called the <HI>premises,</HI> in the passage you refer to, you have concealed from your readers, and took the inference, your
<PB N="47" REF="012066_0024_0F89939BB2419DA8"/>
own inference, and tore it into two pieces and set up one for the <HI>premise,</HI> and call the other the inference from it. By this won∣derful contrivance you endeavor to deceive your readers, into a belief that I did really have the controversy as you and Mr. Hop∣kins say, and that I was guilty of palpable falshood in denying it to him.</P>
<P>I don't expect the reader to believe this charge without evi∣dence of its truth; and therefore must transcribe that passage in the dialogue you refer to. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is in the 25th page.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Gent</HI> The Dr lays it down as a just inference <HI>from what he had said</HI> BEFORE <HI>concerning the</HI> NATURE <HI>and power of the enmity of man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s heart against the nature and moral character of God,</HI> that men are not converted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o God by moral suasion. i e. by any ra∣tional arguments, whereby then hearts are influenced to turn from sin to God.</Q>
(Ser. p 52 1st edit) This, Doctor, is the inference you draw from the doctrine concerning the <HI>nature</HI> and power of the enmity against God, which you had before laid down in the <HI>doctrinal part</HI> of your discourse. It is the <HI>head</HI> pro∣position in your second remark, by way of inference from your doctrine concerning the enmity; a summary whereof I gave you just now.—The <HI>Gent.</HI> quoted some others of your words, in your discourse under this head, in which you exprest this inference more strongly:
<Q>The minds of men are too full of enmity to God, to be persuaded to love and be reconciled to him by any, tho' the most powerful arguments, address<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to their understanding or affections; therefore I don't think that regeneration is effected by light, i. e. by presenting the things of religion to their minds, or even by opening their eyes to see them; but in order to this the power of God must be exerted, and by this alone men are created anew.</Q>
(p 53. 1st edit.) Your inference from your doc∣trine concerning the <HI>nature</HI> and power of in wro't enmity, before laid down in the body of your sermon, being now fairly given in your own words, the <HI>Clerg</HI> rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies.
<Q>If the <HI>premises</HI> are true, the <HI>inference</HI> is undoubtedly just.</Q>
By the <HI>premises</HI> he evidently and certainly means what you had before said in the body of your discourse concerning the nature and power of the enmity; from which the <HI>Gent.</HI> said you drew the inference.</P>
<P>I have also observed your efforts to clear your scheme of doc∣trine from the bad consequences I charged upon it But they justly lie at the door, and always will: I could easily shew the utter insufficiency of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nings for this purpose: But I may not now trespass further upon the readers patience, by going into a critical examination of them. If he is judicious, unbiassed and
<PB N="48" REF="012066_0025_0F89939BF4895358"/>
furnished with knowlege, he will readily perceive the weakness of your defence. I don't mean here to intimate any thing dishonorable to your understanding, Doctor The weakness lies in the cause you have espoused. Error can't be defended with real strength, no, not by an angel. Good angels will never un∣dertake its defence. I wish you would give it up, and leave the doctrine of errors to be defended by those to whom they properly belong. What have we to do with them? Our honor is con∣nected with the truth: on the contrary side we gain nothing but shame: victory there, over the weak and credulous, is it fa∣my and confusion. <HI>The deceived and deceiver are his, and dust shall be the serpent's food</HI></P>
<P N="14">XIV. The criticisms, Doctor, by which you endeavour to evade the force of the texts I mentioned as inconsistent with your doctrine, are so manifestly impertinent as not to need a particular answer. I only mention two, as a specimen of your skill, and the liberty you take in evading the testimony of the truth itself. But I must observe one thing you say just before you come to re∣mark on them.</P>
<P>'He' (Mr. H)
<Q><HI>supposes</HI> that <HI>because</HI> the word is called <HI>the sword of the Spirit, it has power to regenerate</HI> But has a sword any power at all?—The written word has no power but what ari∣ses from the <HI>energy of the Spirit</HI> or the testimony of conscience.</Q>
(p 125.) Doctor, you know very well that I did not suppose what you here suggest, but spake repeatedly of the holy Spirit acting upon the mind with the word, in producing this change, and expressed my sentiments very fully that the outward teaching of the written word, without his concurring influence, can't ef∣fect this holy change. In the place you refer to, where I call the word of God the sword of the Spirit, I spake of the Spirit as the agent using this sword. See the pages refered to below <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">D. p 42, 45, 46, 58.</NOTE> This very phrase, '<HI>the energy of the Spirit</HI>' accompanying the word, which you here use in a pretended opposition to me, you found in my dialogue. You repeatedly own what I here represent as my doctrine, to be indeed so. You say, p. 111, 'He' (Mr. H)
<Q>owns that men neither will nor can be influenced to believe sa∣vingly, by the most powerful gospel motives, without the powerful energy of the Spirit.</Q>
And in p. 113, you say,
<Q>We agree that the motives have no power till the Spirit exerts some kind of energy, so that their efficacy is only with, and never without it.—We agree in this</Q>
Thus. Doctor you have borne witness against yourself, that you testified a known falshood in the pas∣sage now under censure. Why will you kill yourself in order to
<PB N="49" REF="012066_0025_0F89939BF4895358"/>
throw false reproach upon me? Instances of the same kind are numerous. You have given full evidence that you are worthy of <HI>no credit</HI> as a witness against me.</P>
<P>I now proceed to observe how you evade two of the texts I mentioned as evidence that God uses and applies the gospel truth to the mind in renewing or regenerating men.—I mentioned this text for this purpose, <HI>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth,</HI> (Jam. 1.18) On this you say,
<Q>But in order to make this serve his turn, he must prove that the word <HI>begat</HI> means regeneration properly taken for the implanting or creating a divine principle in the heart, as distinguished from active con∣version, or the exercise of the new principle when given: till this is proved the text can't help his cause,</Q>
(p. 126) When it is, you hereby own that it will. I should have thought this needed no proof. For what you call
<Q>active conversion, or the exercise of the new principle,</Q>
is the act of the man, not of God as a generator, a consequence or fruit of the work of God in be∣getting or forming him a new creature: and so I think you al∣ways represent it except here to avoid the force of this text.— Doctor, when you see a child exercising the life and power he is endowed with, you don't say his father begat these exercises, but that he begat the child, and the child does the actions.— The holy Ghost speaketh expresly, and in a very determinate manner, as foreseeing and guarding against this perversion of his words in favor of your corrupt doctrines.
<Q>Of his own will <HI>begat</HI> he <HI>us</HI> with the word of truth, that <HI>we</HI> should be a kind of <HI>first fruits of his creatures,</HI></Q>
i. e. in the new creation: Behold, saith the Lord, <HI>I create all things new</HI> The souls of men are created anew, renewed in knowlege, after God's image. He hath begot∣ten <HI>us;</HI> not our actions of the new and holy kind, but <HI>ourselves. We</HI> are new begotten by God, and so new born and his children: can the sense of words be more obvious and fixed? So it is said, God's people shall be <HI>trees of righteousness of the Lord's plant∣ing:</HI> and our Saviour says, <HI>make the tree good that his fruit may be good.</HI> God makes the tree good, a tree of righteousness; which respects the moral change of the mind and heart in regeneration or conversion; in consequence of which the tree bears good fruit.</P>
<P>But you say,
<Q>The Greek word <HI>(apekuese)</HI> rendered <HI>begat,</HI> may—be rendered <HI>impregnated</HI>; and so Dr Doddridge renders it—and this is the most natural meaning of the word in the 15th ver. Sin when it is finished or <HI>perpetrate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> bringeth forth, or rather is <HI>impregnated</HI> with death.</Q>
Doctor, sin is here figu∣ratively represented as a mother, and death as her on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pring.
<PB N="50" REF="012066_0026_0F89939CB86A3AF0"/>
Now a mother conceives feed, is impregnated, is pregnant, and brings forth her children. But where did you ever hear it said that the father in the act of begetting impregnates the child? This word as respecting the father's act as a generator is rightly rendered <HI>beget,</HI> and can't be rendered <HI>impregnated,</HI> in respect to the child begotten, without the greatest absurdity. In this text we ourselves are represented, not as a mother impregnated, but as the creatures or children <HI>begotten.</HI></P>
<P>I only mention one thing more. You seem to think our Lord's parable of the sower affords prooff that regeneration, or the ma∣king the heart good and honest, is wro't by a mere physical pow∣er or operation, without any influence of gospel truth in the heart. (p. 127) Your reasoning on this parable is not good: it does not favor your cause Our Lord's manifest design in this parable, is to point out the causes of the gospel's not producing the fruit of a holy and good life in so many who hear it, viz. the lusts of their hearts which they will not part with; and to shew that if men are of a good and honest heart, they will, by the ministration of the gospel to them, be rendered fruitful in the righteous fruits of a good and christian life. He says nothing here how the heart is made good. Parables will not endure to be strained beyond their manifest design, in support of doctrines they are not intend∣ed to teach or explain. Our Lord does not here say, the heart is made good by the influence of gospel truth upon the mind, neither does he say the contrary, but only says the gospel prevails to make the life truly good only in those whose hearts are good. From hence you argue that the heart is made good without any influence of the word of God.—Doctor, by taking the same liberty in wandering from the design of the parable that you do, I can prove that the hearts of good men are <HI>naturally</HI> good, and reason full as well as you do; thus, the Lord says nothing about making the heart good, but rather intimates that when the sower sows his seed he finds some pieces of ground, some hearts, already good; and we know some parts of literal ground are naturally good. If you don't like my reasoning and inference, you ought to dislike your own, for it is less plausible than mine. Doctor, if you would know how the hearts of men are made good and honest, you must look for an account of it in those texts that speak of this, not in those that say nothing about it.</P>
<P>Another text I opposed to this doctrine of yours, you thus in∣troduce and remark upon.
<Q>His second evidence he introduces thus, Jesus says to the <HI>unconverted</HI> Jews, if ye continue in my word—ye shall <HI>know</HI> the truth, And <HI>the truth</HI> shall make you
<PB N="51" REF="012066_0026_0F89939CB86A3AF0"/>
free.</Q>
(John 8.31, 32.)
<Q>N. B. Mr. H. says these Jews were <HI>unconverted</HI>: but let us hear the text; Then Jesus said to those Jews which <HI>believed on him,</HI> If ye continue in my word, &amp;c.</Q>
(p. 126) This is all you say in the text of your discourse</P>
<P>I suppose, Doctor, after you had wrote this, you reflected that it is most evident, <HI>from the context,</HI> that these Jews were <HI>really unconverted,</HI> and unregenerate too; that their faith was far from being saving, was nothing more than a momentary, light persua∣sion that Jesus was their expected Messiah; which they were in∣duced to admit from an imagination that he was come to enrich them with worldly good things, and which they laid down again upon the spot, as soon as they perceived that he was like to dis∣appoint these carnal hopes; and so, that I was right in calling them <HI>unconverted.</HI> Doctor, you know very well that <HI>such</HI> was their faith, and <HI>such</HI> their character; I presume you do. You perceiv'd that what you said, carried an intimation that you tho't these Jews were true believers, and that this would not be satis∣fying: and therefore you added in a note,
<Q>Whether these Jews were <HI>really</HI> converts or not, <HI>I will not determine.</HI></Q>
You can't but know that the context clearly determines they <HI>were not.</HI> You dare not say <HI>they were,</HI> in the face of such decisive evidence; and you would not say they <HI>were not,</HI> because if you admitted this, you could not avoid the evidence the text gives in that your notions concerning regeneration, are false. So you gave much such a prudent answer as the parents of the blind man gave,— 'Who hath opened his eyes, <HI>we know not.</HI>'—You think to get rid of this troublesome text, by saying (and this is all you further say)
<Q>However, this is certain, that Christ speaks to them <HI>as be∣lievers on him</HI>: and therefore these words are nothing to Mr. H's purpose.</Q>
In this, Doctor, you implicitly acknowlege that if he had spoken to them <HI>as unconverted,</HI> they would have been much to my purpose. Well, but he did speak to them as uncon∣verted, and under the present dominion of vicious lusts, and points out to them the way and means by which they might be delivered from them, be regenerated.</P>
<P N="15">XV. Doctor, you tell us you
<Q>maintain the necessity of a constant, diligent, careful attendance on all the means of <HI>know∣lege or</HI> of grace which God has appointed; and that the neglect of them is a grievous sin, highly provoking to God, <HI>hazardous</HI> to the soul—and therefore press people to the diligent use of them,</Q>
p. 129. I don't blame you for this.—I presume you call them 'means of <HI>knowlege or</HI> of grace' <HI>upon design.</HI> For, upon your principles, they are not means of <HI>grace,</HI> if by grace is meant any
<PB N="52" REF="012066_0027_0F89939D7627F3E0"/>
more than <HI>knowlege</HI>: and when knowlege is gained by the use of these means even the most that can be gained by the unregenerate, this is <HI>no means</HI> of <HI>further grace,</HI> and can have no possible influ∣ence, as a means or instrument, in renewing and morally chang∣ing the heart; but it necessarily acts as a <HI>means</HI> of <HI>increasing</HI> the <HI>enmity</HI> of the heart against God, and making it more like a devil. You, and all in your scheme, had better drop the word <HI>grace,</HI> and only call them means of increasing such knowlege as is a means of increasing enmity, and making men worse. You tell us you 'hold that the motives,' (i. e. by which God in the gospel urges and draws men to be reconciled to him)
<Q>are made <HI>effectual</HI> by a <HI>preceeding physical</HI> energy, new creating the heart or re∣newing the will in <HI>order</HI> that the motives may have a <HI>proper in∣fluence,</HI></Q>
p. 113 Before this imagined physical change, in which knowlege or faith has no place as an instrument or means, you say,
<Q>The clearer the light shines, the more sensibly will the un∣renewed sinner's enmity exert itself</Q>
p. 124. I told you in the dialogue that if this is the case, 'tis to no purpose to address men in the apostle's words, <HI>We beseech you to be reconciled to God; for,</HI> &amp;c. i. e. with a view to persuade them to be reconciled. In your answer you implicitly allow the consequence to be just, and say, the gospel may answer that dreadful purpose mentïoned in Isaiah, <HI>Hear ye indeed but understand not, see ye indeed, but perceive not.</HI> p. 125. i. e in plain language, it is adapted to make such creatures as unrenewed men are, more wicked and miserable, but not to make them better. Accordingly you reject, with scorn, the tho't of a man's being at all prepared or predisposed to receive the kingdom of God, or to become a new creature, till the mo∣ment in which he is made so, by <HI>physical</HI> power, by any influ∣ence of the gospel &amp; Spirit of Christ upon him; but, on the contrary, teach that under the highest illuminations and influences of com∣mon grace he remains wholly indisposed to it, and is more at enmity to it than he was in his uninlightened state, p. 114. Do you think, Doctor, Elias was sent to prepare the way of the Lord, and make the people ready to receive him, by blowing up their enmity into a flame? Agreeably to your own doctrine you re∣present the most enlightened and earnest seekers of God's special grace, under the highest influences of common grace, as '<HI>devout pharisees</HI>;' and intimate that a Mary Magdalen, with all her de∣vils in her, or publicans and harlots in the midst of their wick∣edness, are as near to the kingdom of God, or as well disposed to receive the renewing influence of the Spirit as these. See your 130th page. The pharisees, Doctor, were distinguished from
<PB N="53" REF="012066_0027_0F89939D7627F3E0"/>
harlots, and common, open, ignorant sinners in these things, (1) They had more knowlege. (2) Greater enmity to God and his truth. (3) They were more devout in outward shew, and were more hypocritical. And your awakened, inlightened, earnest, reforming seekers of God's mercy and grace, are, according to your doctrines and notion of them, like the pharisees in these re∣spects for which reason. I presume, you, after Sandeman, give them the respectful &amp; encouraging title of <HI>devout pharisees.</HI> If this is their true character, you ought to place them in the rear, behind har∣lots, and open sinners, who don't trouble themselves about reli∣gion, for they are really worse men, as the old pharisees were, (and so your doctrine says) and to tell them plainly, as our Lord does their predecessors, that publicans and harlots go into the kingdom of God before them, because they are more easily bro't to repen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance. And when by your teachings and their diligent, earnest endeavors in the use of means, in compliance with your exhortations, you have compleatly formed them <HI>devout pharisees,</HI> you should say to them.
<Q>Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?</Q>
Can you bear the application of your own doctrines?</P>
<P>You say, Doctor, 'tis hazardous for men to neglect the means of grace. 'Tis indeed so: but according to your doctrine, 'tis in one view more hazardous to use than to neglect them. Your doctrines defeat your exhortations, and render them vain and ab∣surd. If the people understood them clearly, and believed them fully, they would soon be reduced to abhor the offerings of the Lord, and take up the resolution of the Jewish desperadoes, <HI>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die.</HI></P>
<P>You tell us, Doctor, that you 'press people to use the means of grace —because this is the way in which God is pseased to work, and out of which there is no reason to expect he ever will work this blessed change,' <HI>regeneration.</HI> This is the way: but if your doctrines were true, it could not be so. Have you so corrupted in yourself the right sense of God as to imagine that he puts men upon a course of means and endeavors, which can have no better effect than to make them <HI>devout pharisees,</HI> and render them <HI>two fold more the children of hell</HI> than they were before, as an ordinarily necessary preliminary to his regenerating them? Do you think the beauty and moral excellency of God's character shines gloriously in such a method of procedure? I presume you and others have been lead to talk in such an unworthy manner of the way of God with men, as consequentially imputes folly and moral absurdity to him, without reflecting seriously on the ten∣dency
<PB N="54" REF="012066_0028_0F89939E365FF3D0"/>
of your doctrines. I hope you will now reflect, and lay your hand on your mouth.</P>
<P>I only add, that if you write again, I hope you will write with fairness, equity and honor. If in the same spirit as before, you may answer yourself; for you will be wholly unworthy the notice of any one else.—As I have pointed out to you some of your great offences against your brother, I presume you are con∣vinced of them: and I now expect you will publicly retract the many false and injurious things you have testified against me, be∣fore the churches and world. I expect this as what you <HI>owe</HI> to me <HI>by the will of God</HI>; as what you owe to the churches to whom you dedicated your injurious charges; as what you owe to the honor of your own character, which you have sorely wounded while throwing dirt upon me; as what you owe to the honor of the gospel.—If you do this in a christian manner, I will as rea∣dily give you the due honor of it as the best friend you have in the world: who am,</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>DOCTOR, one thing which merits notice I have reserved for this place. You mention this text as favoring your doctrine, and seem to triumph in it, as all in your scheme do, viz <HI>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. But he that is spiritual judgeth all things,</HI> 1 Cor 11.14, 15. On this you say,
<Q>By <HI>natural man</HI> is evidently meant the unregenerate man. Now it is here affirm∣ed of this natural man, that he <HI>discerneth</HI> not the things of the Spirit of God.</Q>
(No, Doctor, the apostle saith, <HI>receiveth</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In your quotation of the text you also threw out the apostle's word, <HI>receiveth,</HI> and took in the word <HI>discerneth,</HI> which sounds more favorably for you. I hope, Doctor, you did it in adver∣tantly.</NOTE>)
<Q>Whatever knowlege he may have, he <HI>discerns</HI> nothing of the <HI>spiritual glory</HI> and <HI>beauty</HI> of divine objects, i. e. he has <HI>no taste for moral excellency.</HI> And the reason is given, viz. They are foolishness to him, i. e. in his view of them: and if so, they must be <HI>abhorred</HI>; for what appears <HI>foolish</HI>— must be hateful, in <HI>this view of it.</HI> Here then is a full proof that the natural man sees no beauty in, but really loaths the things of God, and therefore has no taste for moral excellency. q. e. p.</Q>
(p. 88.) q. e. p. which was to be proved. Doctor, you have proved no∣thing but that you don't understand the text at all. I observe two or three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The apostle says the natural man <HI>receiveth not,</HI> and <HI>cannot know</HI> the things of the Spirit of God. You allow he may know them, but say he can't discern their spiritual glory and beauty; i. e. has no taste for moral excellency. Your proposition is not the same in sense with the apostle's, but a very different one. Yours may be false, and yet his be true.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the <HI>things of the Spirit</HI> the apostle means those things which belong to the <HI>gospel,</HI> as its <HI>peculiars.</HI> You extend the sense so as to comprehend all things of a moral nature; and so infer that
<PB N="56" REF="012066_0029_0F89939EF652F798"/>
natural men have no taste for moral excellency. But you put much more into your premises than the apostle will support you in. These are moral rules of God's moral government, viz. <HI>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,</HI> and <HI>do to him whatsoever,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>With what measure you meet it shall be measured to you again.</HI> Do you think this text warrants you in saying, No unregenerate man can discern or taste any moral fitness, beauty, or excellency in these moral rules? If you do, you are sunk below the standard of common sense: if you do not, you must see your demonstration fails, and so your q. e. p. remains yet to be proved: it will be your wisdom never to attempt it again.</P>
<P N="3">3. In endeavoring to prove that natural men have no taste for moral beauty and excellence, you have proved the contrary. You say,
<Q>What appears <HI>foollish, must</HI> be <HI>hateful</HI> to the <HI>natural man,</HI> in this view of it.</Q>
Why so, Doctor? You must answer, be∣cause moral foolishness is, in its own nature, hateful and con∣temptible, as moral wisdom is of an amiable nature. Very true: and so men have a natural sense or taste for moral worth or ex∣cellency. If they saw the object in a true light they would love it: all that is wanting, according to this position of yours, is only to give the mind a just view of the object. This proves too much. A sinful man may possibly see a particular dispensation of divine government to be <HI>wise,</HI> and yet hate and oppose it, from interested views, or thro' partial regard to his lusts, which inter∣fere with it.</P>
<P>If we would gain a right understanding of this text, we should carefully examine what the apostle here means, (1) by <HI>the things of the Spirit.</HI> (2) What by <HI>receiving</HI> and <HI>knowing</HI> them. (3) What by their being <HI>spiritually discerned.</HI> (4) What by the <HI>na∣tural man.</HI> When we have got all his ideas right in respect to these particulars, we shall see how, and whence it is that the natural man receiveth not, &amp;c. I presume when you wrote your comment, you had none of them right. If we enquire wisely concerning these things, I presume we shall see clearly, (1) That by <HI>the things of the Spirit of God,</HI> the apostle intends the doctrines concerning Jesus Christ, the grace of God towards man by him, and the salvation of those that believe, thro the merit of his cross: which doctrine concerning the cross, he says, is a <HI>stumbling block to the</HI> (unbelieving) <HI>Jews, and foolishness to the</HI> (infidel) <HI>Gentiles,</HI> tho' it is seen to be the <HI>wisdom and power of God,</HI> by those that <HI>believe,</HI> and avails to their <HI>salvation.</HI> (See 1 Cor. 1.23, 24.) He stiles these things, <HI>The things that are freely given to us of God,</HI> context, ver. 12 He elsewhere calls these <HI>spiritual things.</HI> And the reason
<PB N="57" REF="012066_0029_0F89939EF652F798"/>
of his calling them so, and, <HI>The things of the Spirit of God,</HI> is that this Spirit is the revealer and teacher of them, and a witness from God, and for Jesus Christ, to the truth of them; without which supernatural teaching and witness, men could not have conceived any idea of these things, and have known them to be true and from God.
<Q>As it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man the things God hath prepared for them that love him.</Q>
(i. e. any idea or knowlege of them, till God revealed them)
<Q>But God hath revealed them unto us <HI>by his Spirit.</HI>—Now we have received—the Spirit that is of God, that we might <HI>know</HI> the things that are freely given to us of God,</Q>

Col. 1.9.—Spiritual understanding, i. e. a true understanding of those things which are freely given to us of God, and revealed by his Spirit, and now written in his word.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. By <HI>knowing</HI> and <HI>receiving</HI> these things of the Spirit of God the apostle intends, knowing them to be true &amp; divine, knowing them to be from God and worthy of him, a divine method of saving sin∣ners, full of wisdom and grace; and receiving them <HI>as such in faith,</HI> and thereupon embracing the christian religion. To receive these things is the same in substance as to receive Jesus Christ, and become disciples to him. Observe the following texts, John 8.19. ch. 14. 7, 9, 10, 11. ch. 15.15, 21. ch. 17.7, 8, 25.

These spiritual things are <HI>spiritually discerned.</HI> By discerning them the apostle means, so examining them as to discern them to be true and divine, from God, and worthy of him, so as to settle down in the belief of them. The Greek word <HI>anakrino</HI> signifies to examine and search out a thing, in order to know what it re∣ally is, and to judge. The apostle useth the word, 1 Cor. 4.4. where it is rendered <HI>judgeth,</HI> (as it is cont. ver. 15) <HI>I know nothing by myself,</HI> (i. e. whereby I am self-condemned) <HI>but he that judgeth me</HI> (i. e. examineth and discerneth what I really am, and judgeth me according to the truth of my character) <HI>is the Lord.</HI> So the word <HI>discern</HI> is frequently used by our translators, as in Gen. 27.23. <HI>He discerned him not.</HI> Isaac, tho' he examined Jacob, yet did not distinguish him, but judged him to be Esau. So in this text, to discern the things of the Spirit of God, is by examining to
<PB N="58" REF="012066_0030_0F89939FB6766200"/>
discern them to be of God, true, divine and excellent, to distin∣guish them with judgment from the things of men, their cunning∣ly devised fables.—Now the apostle says they are <HI>spiritually dis∣cerned,</HI> i. e. thus discerned and distinguished only by the light, teaching, and testimony of the Spirit of God. This is evidently his meaning; and this is most true. For these supernatural doc∣trines concerning our salvation by the cross of Jesus Christ, owe their very existence, <HI>as truths,</HI> to the sovereign good pleasure of God's will; which could never be known to be such as it is, but by his free revelation of it to men. This revelation he has made by his Spirit; and by his Spirit they are attested as truths of God: and men discern them to be such, only in his light, through his teaching, and by admitting his testimony to their truth, as good and sufficient evidence. On this testimony gospel faith is founded. <HI>It is the Spirit that beareth witness—If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater—He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself—He that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son,</HI> 1 John 5.6, 9, 10.—Examine and compare the following texts, in which the same Greek word is used which is here ren∣dered <HI>discerned,</HI> viz. Luke 23.14. Acts 4.9. ch. 17.11. 1 Cor. 10.25, 27. ch 14.24. Acts 25.26. <HI>anakrisis,</HI> examination 1 Cor. 9.3. Acts 12.19. Acts 28.18.</P>
<P>Let us next examine what the apostle here means by the <HI>natu∣ral man.</HI> The Greek word here rendered <HI>natural,</HI> is <HI>psuchikos,</HI> which is derived from <HI>psuke,</HI> which signifies the soul natural to man as a living man: so the apostle says, <HI>Adam was made a living soul. Psukeen Zosan.</HI></P>
<P>Leigh. in his <HI>Critica Saena,</HI> thus renders the word,
<Q>psuchikos animalis. Animalis ab anima, non ab animali.</Q>
In the margin he quotes Beza thus,
<Q><HI>psuchikos anthropos,</HI> i e. homo non alta quam naturali animi luce preditus. A man that hath only <HI>na∣tural</HI> abilities and perfections.</Q>
The apostle speake of a <HI>natural</HI> body and a <HI>spiritual</HI> body, and opposes them to each other, just as be here does the natural and spiritual man.
<Q>It is sown <HI>soma psuchikon,</HI> a <HI>natural</HI> body, it is raised a spiritual body,</Q>
1 Cor. 15.44. i. e The body is sown in the ground such as we recei∣ved it by natural generation, without any supernatural improve∣ment or change, but it is raised a spiritual body, gloriously chan∣ged by the supernatural operation of the Spirit of God. So he says, the first man was made a living soul. When God breathed into him the breath of life, and endowed him with a living soul, furnished with its proper, natural faculties, capacities and passions,
<PB N="59" REF="012066_0030_0F89939FB6766200"/>
he was hereby constituted a compleat man. The work of crea∣ting man thus finished, God <HI>immediately</HI> communicated his Spirit to him, and thereby breathed into his new form'd soul the breath of a spiritual life, superadded to the natural; or in other words, by his supernatural illumination and influence, communicated the true knowlege of God, and awakened the new-c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eated soul <HI>in∣stantly</HI> into filial and holy dispositions and exercises towards his maker and father. Thus he was formed a <HI>spiritual</HI> man — But in the hour of temptation he rebelled against the light, and grieved the Spirit, and he forsook his defiled habitation; and so he became a mere <HI>natural man,</HI> dead to the spiritual life, not hav∣ing the Spirit. This he shewed sufficiently by his foolishly en∣deavoring to hide himself among the trees from the presence of the Lord, when he perceived him approaching.—This forfeited and lost gift of the Spirit, was restored, and could be restored, only on the foot of a new dispensation of sovereign grace, freely given thro' a respect to the sacrifice and mediation of the Son of God, the destin'd Redeemer. This grace was now revealed to Adam, and given on this new foundation, to teach him this su∣pernatural doctrine, and revive spiritual life in him, thro' faith of this new and surprizing discovery; and doubtless was thankfully received, and wro't in our first parents immediate repentance, while they stood before their <HI>judge</HI> and <HI>saviour</HI> And thus they once more became spiritual persons, having received the Spirit of God, as given from the Father, by the Redeemer.—This resto∣red gift could not consistently be conveyed to Adam's children, together with those natural gifts which constitute them men, in the channel of natural generation; or, in other words, could not be connected with the gift of a living soul to his posterity: For he is not the covenant head, from whom this supernatural gift of grace flows, but received it himself from Christ as <HI>his</HI> covenant head, as all his children must, if they ever partake of it.— Therefore the apostle, considering Adam, now fallen, in relation to his seed, represents him only as a <HI>natural man,</HI> destitute of the Spirit: for he can now convey no more to his natural seed, but the gifts which belong to human nature as such, by which they are formed natural men. <HI>The first man Adam was made a living soul: the last Adam was made a quickning spirit</HI>—Made so to his seed, by the constitution of the new covenant. He quickens both soul and body; but first the soul, by giving his Spirit; by receiv∣ing and obeying of which, they are rendered spiritual men; are spiritual so far as they receive, believe and walk in his light, and no farther.—These observations will lead us to a clear under∣standing
<PB N="60" REF="012066_0031_0F8993A074461098"/>
of many other texts, particularly that John 3.3, 5, 6, and that we are examining.—By the <HI>spiritual man,</HI> the apostle here intends such as have received the Spirit of God, given by Jesus Christ, as a teacher; have received his revelation of the things of Christ, and believed them on the credit of his witness, and so set to their seal that God is true in what he has spoken and testified concerning his Son by his Spirit. He says, <HI>God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit</HI>—and <HI>We have received the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God</HI>—and so <HI>We have the mind of Christ</HI>—and <HI>he that is spiritual judgeth all things.</HI> i e. so far as he has received the light which the Spirit gives, examining, he discerns and clearly distin∣guishes the truth and wisdom of God from the fables and folly of men: As our Lord says, <HI>My sheep hear my voice and follow me: but a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of strangers.</HI></P>
<P>I think we can't now be in doubt what the apostle means by the <HI>natural man</HI>—He evidently intends such as have not received the Spirit of God, as their teacher, in his revelation of the hidden things of God to men, and do not give credit to his supernatural witness to their truth; but are led and influenced in their judg∣ment concerning these things, <HI>by the spirit that is of the world,</HI> i e. act under the blasing and blinding influence of the spirit of error and worldly lusts. Such do not receive these things as true and divine, neither can they know them to be so, so long as they re∣fuse the light and witness of the Spirit of God; for they are <HI>spi∣ritually discerned,</HI> are distinguished from false and foolish things, and perceived to be from God, only by that supernatural light which is communicated by the Spirit—Therefore it is said, <HI>He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</HI></P>
<P>When Jesus Christ came to the Jewish people, as a teacher sent from God to reveal the mysteries of his will, the Spirit of God spake to the people by him, and witnessed to the truth of his missi∣on and doctrine: but many received him not, but disbelieved and rejected the witness of the Spirit. These were natural men, who were led by the spirit of this world, and instead of receiving the Spirit of God, offering himself as their guide and teacher, they perversely resisted him, as being stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears. So the Spirit departed from them, and God gave them over to blindness of mind, and hardness of heart. But some that heard did believe, and received Jesus Christ; and in re∣ceiving him received his Spirit, and so became spiritual men. Such as were too strongly attached to their lusts to be persuaded
<PB N="61" REF="012066_0031_0F8993A074461098"/>
to renounce them by the light and teaching of Jesus Christ, and the given drawing influence and witness of his Spirit, and to come out of the world, after Christ, were, after proper trials to gain them, abandoned, and confirmed as children of this world. And so it must be; for such cannot receive the Spirit of God— And to what purpose is it for the Lord to stand always knocking at their door, when they will not know his voice and open the door unto him? Jesus Christ says, <HI>The world cannot receive the Spirit of Truth, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him,</HI> John 14.17. They may, in some measure, see what his doctrine is, and see his works and witness by the gospel revelation; but they don't see the Spirit of God in them, don't know that 'tis he that speaks to them by the gospel revelation, and bears witness to its truths, by these works; but fatally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in taking him for a false and deceiving spirit. Thus the perverse Jews, who were wholly of this world, covetous, ambitious and sensual, saw the doctrine of Christ, and to what it tended, viz. to confound the lusts of this world, and destroy the works of the devil; and they saw the supernatural works by which the Spirit of God witnessed to their truth, as from God; but they did not <HI>see him</HI> in all this. They plainly saw and acknowleged that a supernatural spirit attended upon Jesus Christ, ministring to him, and witnessing to what he said: but they did not know that this was the Spirit of God, but imagined he was a deceiving spirit, and said, 'He casteth out devils by Beelzebub the prince of devils.' Thus they evaded the evidence, and could not receive the light and testimony of the Spirit of God witnessing to his Son Jesus.—But why could they not see and know this Spirit, in distinction from that of the devil? They saw the doctrine he witnessed to, militated against their lusts, and condemned their indulgence of them, and mena∣ced them with destruction, unless they gave them up: this they were obstinately determined not to do: they therefore shut their eyes against the light, and wilfully set themselves to oppose it; and because they could evade the witness of the Spirit to its truth no other way, they said, 'It is not the Spirit of God that bears witnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but the spirit of devils." All obstinately wicked men, who sin on perversely against the light and testimony of the Spirit of Jesus Christ are in the same spirit of this world: all the dif∣ference it in the degree of its strength and malignity—This, Doctor, and not want of natural capacity to see moral excellence, and a natural, inwro't, incurable hatred to it, is the true cause why such men receive not the things of the Spirit of God, and cannot know and approve them as of God, but esteem them as foolishness.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="012066_0032_0F8993A13397FA30"/>The conclusion of the whole matter is this; Paul says to this purpose, Men can't know the gospel or doctrine concerning Jesus Christ to be of God and worthy of God, unless they receive the Spirit of God as the revealer of these things, and admit his witness to them as being of God, not of men, as a true and divine testi∣mony; that if they, as biassed by lasts, refuse and reject him, there is no other way of discerning them to be of God; but they, as led by the spirit of the world, will account them fabulous and foolish: (This has been verified throughout the whole world, from that day to this) He says, on the other hand, That if men receive the Spirit, by which God revealed these things to men, as of God, and credit his testimony, they may, by his teach∣ing, know them to be of God, and, in his light, distinguish them from the things of men, and discern their divine excellence and glory.—You, on the contrary, say to this purpose, That no ilumination, teaching and testimony of the Spirit which he can give to men, can enable them to discern any moral or spiritual excellency and glory in these things, and at all dispose them to receive the truth in faith and love, unless the Spirit first creates a new gust or faculty of taste in them, by a physical operation with∣out light.—Doctor you are very unlucky in the choice of this text: it clearly condemns your doctrine.
<Q>Which ought to have most weight</Q>
your opinion, or the apostle's doctrine?</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, as you see, I have made myself your servant, for the truth's sake,</P>
