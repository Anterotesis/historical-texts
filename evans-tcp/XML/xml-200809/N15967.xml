<P><HI>THE</HI> following Charges and Proofs respecting the Conduct of <HI>PETER LANDAIS,</HI> when he commanded the Frigate Alliance while joined with the Squadron that was, by his Most Christian Majesty supported in Europe in the late war, under the Flag and Commission of the United States, were officially transmitted to this country (soon after the date) in order to be laid before the Sovereignty. But as he <HI>(PETER LANDAIS)</HI> was broke at Boston, and ren∣dered incapable of public service by a Court Martial, for matters totally different, and of a <HI>subsequent date,</HI> it is to be presumed that the Beard of Admiralty had not, at that time, received the Proofs now in question. They were lodged for safety, by the owner, in the Office of Foreign Affairs, where they still remain, in original. They would have been buried in oblivion, if he <HI>(PETER LANDAIS)</HI> had not published in the New-York papers of the <HI>31</HI>st October, <HI>1787,</HI> that their existence was <HI>"AN UNTRUTH."</HI> They are now made public, that the world may judge respecting his Character, and what Credit may be given to his assertions.</P>

<HEAD>CHARGES AND PROOFS RESPECTING THE CONDUCT OF PETER LANDAIS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>(COPY.)</HEAD>
<P>WE, the Officers, &amp;c. of the Ameri∣can squadron now at the Texel, this 30th day of October, 1779, do attest and declare, upon our words of honor, as gentlemen, that all the following Articles, which we subscribe, respecting the con∣duct of PETER LANDAIS, Captain of the frigate Alliance, are really and truly mat∣ters of fact. In Witness whereof, we hereunto sign our names and qualities; and will, at any time hereafter, be ready to prove the same upon oath, if required.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Captain of the Alliance did not take the steps in his power, to prevent his ship from getting foul of the Bon Homme Richard, in the Bay of Biscay; for, in∣stead of putting his helm a-weather and bearing up, to make way for his Com∣manding Officer (which was his duty), he left the deck to load his pistols.</P>
<P N="2">2. When in chace of a ship (supposed an English East-Indiaman), on the — day of August, 1779, Captain Landais did not do his utmost to overtake that ship, which he might easily have done before night; but put his helm a-weather, and bore away several times in the day, after the Alliance had gained the wake of the chace, and was overtaking her very fast.</P>
<P N="3">3. Captain Landais behaved with dis∣respect and impertinence towards the Commander in Chief of the squadron, on frequent occasions.</P>
<P N="4">4. He disobeyed his signals.</P>
<P N="5">5. He very seldom answered any of them.</P>
<P N="6">6. He expressed his fears and appre∣hensions of being taken on the coast of Ireland; and insisted on leaving sight of it immediately, when we had cruised there only two days.</P>
<P N="7">7. His separation from the squadron, the first time, must have happened either through ignorance or design; because tho' he distinctly saw the signal for the course before night, yet he altered it, first two, and then four points of the compass be∣fore morning.</P>
<P N="8">8. His separation from the squadron, the second time, must also have happened through ignorance or design; because, the wind being at N. W. and the other ships, to <HI>his knowledge,</HI> lying to, and being astern of the Alliance, what less than separation could be the consequence of his obstinacy, in ordering the weather main brace to be hauled in, and the ship to be steered S. W. and S. W. by S. in the trough of the sea; which was done from ten at night 'till morning: and he would not then permit the ship to be tacked, in order to rejoin the squadron, as was proposed to him by the officers.</P>
<P N="9">9. On the morning of the 23d Sept. when the Bon Homme Richard, after be∣ing off the Spurn, came in sight of the Alliance and Pallas, off Flamborough Head, Captain Landais distinctly told Captain Cottineau, that if it was, as it ap∣peared, a fifty-gun ship, they must run a∣way; altho' he must have been sure that the Pallas, <HI>from her heavy sailing,</HI> must have fallen a sacrifice.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="6" REF="020436_0004_0FAF0BDB21B95CA0"/>10. In the afternoon of the same day, Captain Landais paid no attention to sig∣nals, particularly the signal of preparation and for the line, which was made with great care, and very distinctly, on board the Bon Homme Richard.</P>
<P N="11">11. Altho' the Alliance was a long way ahead of the Bon Homme Richard, when bearing down on the Baltic fleet, yet Cap∣tain Landais lay out of gun-shot to wind∣ward, until the Bon Homme Richard had passed by and closely engaged the Serapis; and then, instead of coming to close acti∣on with the Countess of Scarborough, the Alliance fired at very long shot.</P>
<P N="12">12. He continued to windward, and, a considerable time after the action began, fell astern and spoke the Pallas; leaving the Countess of Scarborough in the wake of the ships engaged, and at free liberty to rake the Bon Homme Richard.</P>
<P N="13">13. After the Bon Homme Richard and Serapis were made fast along-side of each other, as in the margin, (which was not done till an hour after the engagement began) Captain Landais, <HI>out of musket-shot,</HI> raked the Bon Homme Richard with cross∣bar and grape shot, &amp;c. which killed a number of men, dismounted sundry guns, put out the side-lights, and silenced all the twelve-pounders.</P>
<P N="14">14. The Alliance then ran down to∣wards the Pallas and Countess of Scarbo∣rough, that were, at the time, engaged at a considerable distance to leeward of the Bon Homme Richard and Serapis, and Captain Landais hovered about there out of gun-shot, and without firing, 'till some time after the Countess of Scarborough had struck; and then bore down, under his top-sails, and spoke, first the prize, and then the Pallas, asking a number of questi∣ons.</P>
<P N="15">15. At last Captain Landais made sail, under his top-sails, to work up to wind∣ward, but made tacks before he (being within the range of grape shot, and, <HI>at the longest,</HI> three quarters of an hour before the Serapis struck) fired a second broad∣side into the Bon Homme Richard's lar∣board quarter, the latter part whereof was fired when the Alliance was not more than three points abast the Bon Homme Rich∣ard's beam, altho' many tongues had cried from the Bon Homme Richard, that Cap∣tain Landais was firing into the wrong ship, and prayed him to lay the enemy along-side. Three large signal lanthorns, with proper signal wax candles in them, and well lighted, had also, previously to his firing, been hung over the bow, quarter and waist of the Bon Homme Richard, in a horizontal line, which was the signal of reconnoisance; and the ships, the one hav∣ing a high poop, and being all black, the other having a low stern, with yellow sides▪ were easily distinguishable, it being full moon.</P>
<P N="16">16. The Alliance then passed at a very considerable distance along the larboard or off-side of the Bon Homme Richard, and having tacked and gained the wind, ran down again to leeward, and, in crossing the Bon Homme Richard's bow, Captain Landais raked her with a third broadside, after being constantly called to from the Bon Homme Richard, not to fire, but to lay the enemy along-side.</P>
<P N="17">17. Sundry men were killed and wounded by the broadsides mentioned in the two last articles.</P>
<P N="18">18. Captain Landais never passed on the off-side of the Serapis, nor could that ship ever bring a gun to bear on the Alli∣ance at any time during the engagement.</P>
<P N="19">19. The leaks of the Bon Homme Richard increased much after being fired upon by the Alliance; and as the most dan∣gerous shot which the Bon Homme Rich∣ard received under the water, were under the larboard bow and quarter, they must
<PB N="7" REF="020436_0005_0FAF0BDBD513C468"/>
have come from the Alliance, for the Sera∣pis was on the other side.</P>
<P N="20">20. Several people on board the Alli∣ance told Captain Landais, at different times, that he fired upon the wrong ship; others refused to fire.</P>
<P N="21">21. The Alliance only fired three broadsides while within gun-shot of the Bon Homme Richard and Serapis.</P>
<P N="22">22. The morning after the engage∣ment, Captain Landais acknowledged on board the Serapis, that he raked each time with grape-shot, which he knew would scatter.</P>
<P N="23">23. Captain Landais has acknowledged since the action, that he would have thought it no harm if the Bon Homme Richard had struck, for it would have given him an op∣portunity to re-take her, and to take the Serapis.</P>
<P N="24">24. He has frequently declared that he was the only American in the Squadron, and that he was not under the orders of Captain Jones.</P>
<P N="25">25. In coming into the Texel, he de∣clared that if Captain Jones should hoist a broad pendant, he would, <HI>to vex him,</HI> hoist another.</P>

<P>I THE under-signed Philip Ricot, Captain of a vessel in the service of the United States of America, and Command∣er of the Tender Vengeance, in confor∣mity to the request of Commodore Paul Jones, my Commander, do communicate to him, and affirm to the different circum∣stances hereafter declared; in which M. Landais, Captain of the frigate Alliance, has, in this cruize, appeared to have devi∣ated from that subordination which the ser∣vice requires.</P>
<P>I observed, that, on the 31st of August, at half past four in the afternoon, a signal was made him by the Commodore to chace a sail in sight, which M. Landais did not obey.</P>
<P>The next day, Sept. 1st, the Commo∣dore made him a signal to come under his stern, that he might speak with him: this M. Landais did not do.</P>
<P>The 5th of Sept. the Captains of the division being on board the Commodore, according to his orders, M. Landais was the only one who refused to go; and al∣tho' Messrs. de Chamillard and Cottineau went on board the Alliance, to persuade him to it, he persisted in his refusal.</P>
<P>That, in the night of the 23d and 24th of said month, during the engagement be∣tween the Bon Homme Richard and the Serapis, the Alliance remained within can∣non-shot of the enemy's ship, from about half after eight till ten o'clock, without my having seen her fire. I shall add, that, Oct. 1st, at eight at night, I received or∣ders from the Commodore to go and tell M. Landais, who was to windward, to take post a-stern of him; to which I re∣ceived
<PB N="9" REF="020436_0007_0FAF0BDD452BA390" MS="y"/>
this answer, and which was repeated by M. Landais himself: <HI>"Go, tell the Commodore, that he may go where he plea∣ses."a</HI> The inconsistence of this answer, and his rudeness to me, have since obliged me to testify my dissatisfaction to M. Lan∣dais, who appeared to have forgot it.</P>

<P>THESE are to certify, that I, Henry Lunt, Second Lieut. of the American ship of war, the late Bon Homme Richard, but now of the Serapis, commanded by the Honorable John Paul Jones, having, on the 23d day of Sept, 1779, been ordered in a pilot-boat, with a party of men, after a brig; but, some time after I set out from along-side, a signal was made for me to return back to the Bon Homme Richard, she being then in chace of two British ships of war, the Serapis and Countess of Scar∣borough; and before I could get on board the Bon Homme Richard, she commenced engagement with the British ship of war Serapis. It being night, I thought it not prudent to go along-side in the time of ac∣tion. Being in this boat near, I had an opportunity of seeing some part of the Alliance's behaviour, above three quarters of an hour after the action began with the Richard and Serapis. The Alliance was to windward of them, and appeared to be lying to, about one mile distance. At the same time, the Pallas was engaging the Countess of Scarborough to leeward of the Alliance, out of my sight. Presently, af∣ter the Pallas and Countess of Scarborough had ceased firing, the Alliance bore down for them, and disappeared out of my sight. What she did there, I can't tell; but she was gone, as near as I can judge, one hour and three-quarters, and then appeared to me to be going up to assist the Bon Homme Richard, but was half-an-hour from that time before she fired; and, after she got up to the Richard and Serapis, she fired, and then stood off from them to the East∣ward some ways and, as near as I can judge, was gone better than half an hour, then returned back to the Richard and Se∣rapis, and fired again.</P>

<P>I, THE under-signed, certify, that I was extremely surprised in the evening of the 23d of September, when I did not hear
<PB N="10" REF="020436_0008_0FAF0BDDF05CBCC0"/>
the Alliance begin the engagement, either with the Serapis or the Countess of Scar∣borough; having remarked, just before I went to the main-top (where I command∣ed a detachment during the action), that she appeared to me to be very near them. M. Landais had pressed sail, during the whole afternoon, without orders. M. Cottineau hailed us, and asked what station he should take during the action, and com∣plained to M. Jones, that M. Landais, instead of forming the rear, as it had been agreed, took the van, which was his (M. Cottineau's), from him. M. Jones, how∣ever, made the signal for forming the line; and I well recollect that he caused a ma∣noeuvre to be made, in order that the Al∣liance might clearly see his signal; but M. Landais, <HI>as usual,</HI> paid no attention to it; and we all thought the Alliance engaged a long time before us.</P>
<P>After taking my station in the main-top, I thought no more of the Alliance, be∣cause the main-top-sail hid her from me. A little while after the Serapis hailed us, and I then perceived the Serapis and the Countess of Scarborough pretty nigh each other. We immediately began the en∣gagement with the Serapis, and I did not perceive the Alliance till about two hours afterwards, when I saw her rake us with her whole broadside, a little to larboard of us; and, at the same time, I heard a hundred voices hailing the Alliance, and telling them, that it was on board the Bon Homme Richard that she was firing; a moment afterwards she passed us on our larboard side, and it was with difficulty, that I hindered the people whom I com∣manded from firing on her. I hailed M. Landais as loud as I could, saying to him, "I beg you will not sink us." I at the same time thought that M. Landais was taking the advantage of our circumstances to destroy M. Jones, and thereby save himself the trouble he must have expected for having disobeyed M. Jones, in chasing without orders, and in edging off, to shape a contrary course, when the signal was made to chase; and on several other occa∣sions, such as refusing to come on board the Bon Homme Richard to consult on the necessary operations, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Alliance then came athwart our bow, and began afresh to cannonade us ve∣ry smartly; I then had not the least doubt of his intention to sink us, and should have fired on the Alliance, in preference to the Serapis, but that the main-top-sail and o∣ther sails concealed her from us. At the instant when they cried that the Serapis had struck, I came down, and was inform∣ed that the Alliance had killed us a number of people, and, amongst others, an Offi∣cer who was on the forecastle. In my o∣pinion, there was not a soul on board the Bon Homme Richard, who did not believe that M. Landais knew us before he fired, as we were higher out of water than the Se∣rapis; that it was moon-light, and that we had made the signal by which we must have been known, during the action.</P>
<P>The First Lieutenant of the Countess of Scarborough told me, some days since, that he had remarked, during the action with the Pallas, that the Alliance was for some time athwart and to windward of them; that as soon as the Scarborough had struck, the Alliance came and hailed them, and asked them, what vessel that was, which was engaged? He was answered, that it was the Serapis. He asked her force, but they would not tell him; he then tacked and shaped his course, under his top-sails <HI>only,</HI> to join us.</P>

<P>WHEREAS since the campaign of 1779, there have been various and partial reports secretly spread against the private and social character of Commodore Paul Jones, formerly commanding the squadron of the Bon Homme Richard; and as, among other hearsays and groundless sto∣ries, I have sometimes heard that the a∣bove-mentioned Officer had formally giv∣en the Lie to M. Landais, formerly Cap∣tain of the Alliance, relating to the loss of a boat in sight of the coast of Ireland:— Therefore, I declare and affirm, that the aforesaid Commodore did not say to M. Landais, "You Lie," but no more than these very words, "It is an untruth;" which M. Landais was pleased to interpret as a <HI>formal giving the Lie;</HI> who was never able to overcome his peevish, obstinate, turbulent and ungovernable temper, which he constantly shewed during the whole of the campaign. Moreover, I certify, that Commodore Paul Jones, far from com∣manding with haughtiness or brutality, as certain persons have endeavored to circu∣late, was always (tho' very strict and sharp in the service) affable, genteel, and very indulgent, not only towards his Officers, but likewise towards the sailors and soldi∣ers, whom he ever treated with humanity. —As I was a witness to the above-menti∣oned quarrel, I must in conscience confess, that M. Landais gave, at the time, great cause for it, by the arrogant manner which he assumed towards his Commander, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n answer to the peaceable, good and fair <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easons, to which he would never yield; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o far to the contrary, that he (M. Lan∣dais) answered the Commodore (I and Lieutenant Colonel Chamillard both being present) in the most gross and insulting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erms—at first in English, which he imme∣diately rendered in French, that M. Cha∣millard might not be ignorant of any thing that passed. The whole of the aforesaid quarrel happened in the round-house of the Bonne Homme Richard, the 23d or 25th of August, in the above-mentioned year. I conclude by saying, that M. Landais ac∣companied or affirmed his offensive and ve∣ry scandalous discourse, by the most pro∣voking gestures.</P>

<P>The ship in question was the <HI>Indien,</HI> then on the stocks at Amsterdam, belonging to the United States. But this having been discovered to the British Minister by some of Mr. Arthur Lee's papers, of which they had got possession just before Mr. Paul Jones arrived at Paris, and the Trea∣ty of Alliance being on the point to be concluded, he consented to their assigning over the property of that ship to the King of France. Among the political reasons which operated this arrangement, was the great opposition made to the equipment of the Indien, by the British Ambassador in Holland. The command of the Indien was, however, reserved for Mr. Paul Jones, till (subsequent to his campaign of 1779) he had made an arrangement of a plan with the Count de Maurepas, which promised much greater importance to the common cause, and required his immediate return to America. After this, his Majesty lent the use of the Indien to the Prince de Luxembourg for three years, and the Prince <HI>chartered her,</HI> for the term pre∣scribed, to Mr. Gillon, of South-Caroli∣na, under the commission of that State. This was the ship that Mr. Gillon came in to Philadelphia, under the name of the <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> in the year 1782.</P>

And about two hours after the engagement first commenced, I saw, to my great surprise, the Alliance come under the Bon Homme Richard's stern, and fire her whole broadside into the Bon Homme Richard; she then came along the off side of the Bon Homme Richard, and came under the Bon Homme Richard's bow, when she discharged another volley of both grape and round shot, which I heard strike the rigging, masts, &amp;c. on board the Bon Homme Richard.</P>
<P>Though previous to the Alliance's firing the second time into the Bon Homme Rich∣ard, I heard some of our officers and men call to the Alliance (which was not then with∣out hail) for God's sake not to fire into the Bon Homme Richard, for, said they, you have killed several of our men already. Notwithstanding all this, she fired a number of shot afterwards into the Bon Homme Richard.

I went up immediately, and saw

her pass by us. She then, in about two hours' time, came under our stern, and while we were hailing her, she fired into our larboard quarter, and went a-head of us; then came before the wind, athwart our bows, when she was hailed, by Capt. Jones's orders, to lay the enemy on board; but they returning no answer, were hailed once or twice again, to which they an∣swered ay, ay, and immediately fired se∣veral guns, but they being at too great a distance to damage the enemy, without hurting of us, when she might have come half as near again without any danger of running foul of us, or damaging us. But, previous to the above-mentioned engage∣ment, a signal was hove out from the Bon Homme Richard, to form a line of battle, to which the Alliance paid no attention, but during the whole cruize, the Alliance very seldom attended to any of Capt. Jones's signals. It is my sincere opinion, on the conduct of the Commander of the said ship, together with her manoeuvres during the time of action, on the 23d of last Sep∣tember, that his motive must have been to kill Capt. Jones, and distress the Bon Homme Richard, so as to cause her to strike to the Serapis, that he might him∣self be able to take the Serapis, and honor himself with laurels of that day.</P>

Some time after, I being ordered from my station in the mizen-top on deck, I saw, from the forecastle, the Alliance standing athwart our bows before the wind; Mr. Linthwaite was then hail∣ing her, by Captain Jones's orders, to lay the enemy on board, but hearing no an∣swer to his repeated hail, I hailed her in the same words, "lay the enemy on board;" no answer being yet made, I asked them if they heard us, to which they replied ay, ay, and fired several guns at that distance, that part of her grape and can∣nister shot damaged us as well as the ene∣my; whereas, it is my opinion, had the Alliance came half the distance nearer the Serapis than she did, she might have clear∣ed the enemy's decks, and not have raked the Bon Homme Richard.</P>

This Ship then disappeared, and did not return until an hour and a half; as soon as she was dis∣covered, Captain Jones ordered the signal lanthorns of reconnoissance to be placed at proper distances from each other, on the larboard side, which order was obeyed by the Master, notwithstanding, she came up to our larboard quarter and fired into us, then shot a-head and stood athwart our bow, when I hailed, by order from Cap∣tain Jones, to lay the enemy on board, to which no answer was made: Mr. Coram also repeated the same order, then asked them if they heard us, their reply was ay, ay, the instant after, she raked without apparently drawing any nearer the distance than being only within the range of grape shot, and the two ships lying parallel with their sides touching each other, several of his shot were drove into the Bon Homme Richard. The conclusion I shall make, re∣lative to Captain Landais' conduct on the 23d of Sept. and previous to that time, is, that his principal object was to kill Captain Jones, cause the Richard to strike, that he might step in and claim the honor of the day.</P>

<P>CAPTAIN Landais has oftentimes, in my presence, spoken disrespectfully and even impudently of Captain Jones. On one occasion, about the beginning of Sep∣tember last, on the coast of Scotland, I went on board the Alliance frigate, by de∣sire of Captain Jones, and told Captain Landais, that he requested of him to be furnished with the names of the Officers and men he had, a day or two before that, put on board the prize ship the Union, Cap∣tain Johnston, that he (Captain Jones) might be enabled to dispatch her; or to be informed what directions he had given, if any, as well with respect to that vessel, as also with respect to the prize ship, the Betsey, Captain Fisher, which also had been manned from the Alliance. Captain Lan∣dais, in reply, told me very pertly, that Captain Jones had no business at all to give orders, or to concern himself with any of those vessels, for that both of them had al∣ready received proper instructions from him; and that the orders he had given were agreeable to the direction he had received from Captain Jones. I told him
<PB N="16" REF="020436_0014_0FAF0BE26BBDC4E8"/>
I was of opinion no Commander in the squadron, except Captain Jones, was au∣thorised to send away a prize, or other∣wise dispose of her, when in his presence, but by virtue of particular orders obtain∣ed from him for that purpose. Captain Landais, in a <HI>sneering</HI> manner, again re∣plied, that he would let Captain Jones know, that he had as good a right to dis∣patch prizes as he had; that they were Captains of equal rank; and that the only difference between them was seniority on the part of Captain Jones, which he held of little consideration: and at last Colonel Wibert, who had accompanied me on board, and myself returned on board the Bon Homme Richard, totally unable to in∣form Captain Jones what Captain Landais had ordered with respect to those two ships. A short time after this, a signal was made on board the Commodore's ship, for the Captains of the squadron to come on board. Captain Cottineau and Captain Ricot accordingly came on board. Captain Landais not obeying, Captain Jones desired me to go again on board the Alliance, and deliver Captain Landais a letter which he then handed to me, and which I understood contained an order for him to come imme∣diately on board; accordingly I went on board the Alliance, and delivered Captain Landais the letter, which he took with him to the cabin, and in a few minutes returned and delivered me another for Captain Jones: this I brought instantly on board, and delivered to him. It contained a se∣cond refusal on the part of Captain Lan∣dais, and very much offended the gentle∣men who had politely obeyed the signal, and were then waiting for him. Captain Jones, chagrined by the obstinacy or that Officer, would have proceeded to the busi∣ness he had in view, without paying any fur∣ther attention to him; but being still anxi∣ous to have his opinion on and approbation of the measure, conjointly with the other Officers of the squadron, a further at∣tempt to obtain his company was resolved on; for this purpose (at the desire of Captain Jones) Captain Cottineau, Mr. Chamillard and myself went on board the Alliance, to try the effect of persuasion upon Captain Landais; but in vain did those gentlemen represent to him the ab∣solute necessity there was for his joining in consultation with his brother Officers; that the good of the service demanded his com∣pliance, as an enterprize of some moment was to be deliberated on; but, alas! in vain did they waste an hour and more in arguments to this end; in vain did they at∣tempt to persuade him; in vain did they entreat him; in vain did they tell him what he had to dread from the consequen∣ces of his obstinately persisting to disobey the orders of his Commanding Officer. In∣stead of paying polite attention to the ad∣vice given him, he, on the contrary, not only disregarded it, but gave himself the liberty to speak of Captain Jones in terms highly disrespectful and insolent, and said he would see him on shore, when they must kill one or other, &amp;c.</P>
<P>On the 23d September last, when the signal for a general chase was given to pur∣sue the Baltic fleet, the Alliance Frigate was the headmost ship of our squadron, and continued to keep a-head until she began to near the enemy, when Captain Landais very unexpectedly and agreeably surprised Capt. Jones by hauling his ship's wind, thereby politely leaving room for his com∣mander to approach the largest ship, which he instantly engaged; Capt. Landais still keeping at a respectful distance from his commander, which respect he however continued to preserve, mal-a-propos, until very late in the engagement. The action had lasted more than an hour, and the Se∣rapis and Bon Homme Richard had been made fast along-side each other by Captain Jones, head and stern together, for some time before I received the wound which obliged me to quit the deck, at which time the Bon Homme Richard still continued a∣lone with a force much superior to herself; and altho' she had been most severely treat∣ed by her enemy, she nevertheless conti∣nued to hug her in close embrace. The
<PB N="17" REF="020436_0015_0FAF0BE358A288A8"/>
behaviour of our consorts upon this day was very mysterious, but that of Captain Landais was of such a cast, as, in my opini∣on, must unavoidably announce him to the public a man devoid of conduct—a man of infamous principles—or, a rank coward.</P>

And it is highly worthy of remark, that before the Alliance raked the Bon Homme Richard by firing alternately into her head and stern, the enemy had been dislodged and driven from the tops and quarter-deck of the Serapis to her first and second batteries, where they were under cover; whereas, the discharge of the se∣cond battery aforesaid having beaten in one side of the Bon Homme Richard and blown out the other, so as to make a breach from before the main-mast to the stern, inclusive of the stern-post and rudder, which were cut off, had ferreted out and dislodged all the persons who had been there skulking: They had taken a new post for safety, on the forecastle of the Bon Homme Richard, where they could not be fired upon from the Serapis, but were exposed to the fire of the Alliance, as well as the officers and men who had behaved gallantly from the beginning.]</P>

<P>The following extract of a Letter from Dr. Franklin to Capt. Landais, dated Passy, March 12, 1780, and which he has published, will serve to give a further insight into his character:</P>
<P><Q>NO one has ever learned the opi∣nion I formed of you from the enquiry made into your conduct—I kept it en∣tirely to myself—I have not even hint∣ed it in my letters to America, because I would not hazard giving to any one a bias to your prejudice. By communi∣cating <HI>a part of that opinion</HI> privately to you, I can do no harm, for you may burn it. I should not give you the pain of reading it, if your demand did not make it necessary: I think you then so imprudent, so litigious and quarrel∣some a man, even with your best friends, that peace and good order, and conse∣quently the quiet and regular subordi∣nation so necessary to success, are, where you preside, impossible; these are with∣in my observation and apprehension:— Your military operations I leave to more capable judges. If, therefore, I had twenty ships of war in my dispositi∣on, I should not give one of them to Captain Landais: The same temper which <HI>excluded</HI> him from the French marine <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He imposed himself on America as having been Captain of a ship of the line, in the navy of France; but the fact ra∣ther appears to be, that having been placed under the Capitaine du Port, or Master Attendant of the Port of Brest, he was not in the line of promotion of the corps of Officers of the marine, (Capitaine de Bru∣lot, and several other subaltern grades, ha∣ving no affinity to the respective duty re∣quired of those under officers in that ser∣vice, are in the same predicament) and therefore he never had, and could not have attained the rank of <HI>Lieutenant de Vaisseau,</HI> or even Ensign in the Royal Na∣vy. After he had given ten years trial of his <HI>temper</HI> and <HI>talents,</HI> he had been dis∣missed from the service of France without honors or a pension; and was adrift for several years, when, in the year 1777, he prevailed on Mr. Deane, by constant ap∣plication, to take him into the service of America. He told Mr. Deane he had been formerly appointed Captain of a ship of the line, and had been <HI>sacrificed</HI> by jea∣lousy. But this pretended <HI>line of battle ship</HI> was nothing but an old transport ves∣sel that had been condemned and disarm∣ed, as unfit for war. Mr. Landais was employed to bring a transport vessel from France to America, with a brevet of Cap∣tain in the American navy, and an extra gratification of twelve thousand livres— he arrived in America about the time when the alliance was concluded with France; and Congress not only confirmed his brevet, but also appointed him Captain of the best fri∣gate in their service, then just launched, and named her the ALLIANCE. This was in∣tended as a compliment to his Most Chris∣tian Majesty, therefore Congress had been grossly imposed upon. Since he has been turned out of the American service, it is said, and believed, he has been constantly complaining, abusing the most respectable characters, and saying he has been again <HI>"sacrificed"</HI> by a general combination; beginning with Dr. Franklin. He has at∣tacked the justice of Congress, and of all persons in authority under the sovereignty: Yet his pecuniary advantages have not been less considerable (exclusive of the twelve thousand livres gratuity) than if he had left the service of his own accord, and with honor.</NOTE> would weigh equally with me; of course I shall not replace him in the Alliance.</Q></P>
