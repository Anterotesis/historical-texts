<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ONE Reason which moved me to write and Print this little Book, was, Because, tho' there are many excellent Heart-affect∣ing Discourses in the World, that tend to convert the Sinner: yet I had a Desire to my this simple Method of mine; Wherefore I make bold thus to invite and incourage the Worst to come to <HI>Christ</HI> for Life.</P>
<P>I have been Vile myself, but have obtained Mercy, and I would have my Companions in Sin partake of Mercy too, &amp; therefore I have writ this BOOK.</P>
<P>The Nation doth swarm with vile Ones now, as ever it did since it was a Nation. My Book in some places can scarce go from House to House, but twill find a suitable Sub∣ject to spread it self upon. Now since <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> is willing to save the vilest, why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould they not by Name be somewhat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cquainted with it, and bid come to him under that Name?</P>
<P>A great Sinner, when converted seems a Booty to Jesus Christ, he gets by saving
<PB REF="003637_0002_10023A2B08D955C8"/>
such an one; why then should both Jesus lose his Glory and the Sinner lose his Soul at once, &amp; that for want of an Invitation?</P>
<P>I have found, thro' God's Grace, good Suc∣cess in preaching upon this Subject, &amp; per∣haps so I may, by my writing upon it too: I have, as you see, let down this Net for a Draught, the Lord catch some great Fishes by it, for the magnifying of his Truth. There are some most vile in all Mens Eyes, and some are so in their own Eyes too; but some have the Paintings to shroud Vileness under, yet they are naked and open unto the Eyes of him with whom we have to do: And for all these, God hath sent a Saviour Jesus; &amp; to all these the Door is opene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>Wherefore prithee profane Man, give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little Book the Reading. Come, Pardon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Part in Heaven &amp; Glory, cannot b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hurtful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thee, Let not thy Lusts &amp; Folly drive the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beyond the Door of Mercy, since it is not lockt nor bolted up against thee. <HI>Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣sah</HI> was a bad Man, &amp; <HI>Magdalen</HI> a bad <HI>Woman</HI>: To say nothing of the <HI>Thief</HI> upon the <HI>Cross,</HI> or of the Murderers of Christ, yet they obtained Mercy; Christ willingly re∣ceived them. And dost thou think that those once so bad, now they are in <HI>Heaven,</HI> repent them there, because they left their Sins for Christ when they were in this World? I cannot believe but thou think∣est they have verily got the best on't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB REF="003637_0003_1002021B50B5C560"/>
why Sinner do thou likewise; Christ at Heaven Gates says to the, <HI>come hither</HI>; and the Devil at the Gates of Hell does call thee <HI>to come to him,</HI> Sinner what sayst thou? Whither wilt thou go? Don't go into the Fire, where thou wilt be burned: Don't let Jesus lose his Longing, since 'tis for thy Salvation, but come to him &amp; live.</P>
<P>One Word more, &amp; so I have done: Sinner, here thou dost hear of Love, prithee don't provoke it by turning it into Wantoness He that dies for slighting Love sink deepest into Hell, and will, there be tormented by the Remembrance of that Evil, more than by the deepest Cogitati∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of all his other Sins.

<P>Beginning at Jerusalem.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE whole Verse runs thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>And that repentance, and remis∣sion of Sins should be preached in his name among all nations, Be∣ginning at Jerusalem.</HI> The words were spoken by Christ after he rose from the Dead, and they are here rehearsed after an Historical manner, but do contain in them a formal Commission, with a special <HI>Clause</HI> therein. The Commission is as you see for the Preaching of the Gospel, and is very distinctly inserted in the Holy Record by <HI>Matthew</HI> and <HI>Mark. Go teach all Na∣tions, &amp;c. Go ye into all the World and preach the Gospel unto every Creature, Matt.</HI> 28.19. <HI>Mark</HI> 16.15. Only this <HI>Clause</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="003637_0004_10023A3CDDD8B388"/>
is in special mention'd by <HI>Luke,</HI> who saith, That as Christ would have the Doctrine of Repentance and Remission of Sins preach∣ed in his Name among all Nations, so he would have the People of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to have the first proffer thereof, <HI>preach it,</HI> saith Christ, <HI>in all Nations; but begin at Jeru∣salem.</HI></P>
<P>The Apostles then thought they had a Commission so large as to give them War∣rant to go and preach the Gospel in al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the World, yet by this <HI>Clause</HI> they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> limited, as to the beginning of their Mi¦nistry; They were to begin this Work a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Jerusalem, Beginning at Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>Before I proceed to an Observation up¦on the Words, I must (but briefly) touc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon two things: Namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. Shew you what <HI>Jerusalem</HI> now wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P N="2">2 Shew you what it was to preach the Gospel to them.</P>
<P>For the first, <HI>Jerusalem</HI> is to be considere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of, either,</P>
<P N="1">1. With respect the descent of her Peo¦ple. Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. With respect to her Preference an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Exaltation. Or,</P>
<P N="3">3. With respect to her present State <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to her Decays.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> As to her <HI>Descent</HI>: She was from <HI>Abraham,</HI> from the Sons of <HI>Jacob,</HI> a Peo¦ple that God singled out from the rest o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="3" REF="003637_0004_10023A3CDDD8B388"/>
the Nations to set his Love upon them.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As to her Preference or Exal∣tation, she was the place of God's Worship, and that which had in and with her the special Tokens and Signs of God's Favour and Presence, above any other People in the World. Hence the Tribes went up to <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI> to worship, there was God's House; God's High Priest, God's Sacrifices accep∣ted, and God's Eye, and God's Heart per∣petually, <HI>Psal.</HI> 76.1, 2. <HI>Psal.</HI> 122.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1 Kings 9.3. But,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We are to consider <HI>Jerusalem</HI> al∣so in her Decays; for as she is so considered, she is the proper Object of our Text, as will be further shewed by and by.</P>
<P><HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as I told you, was the place and seat of God's Worship, but now decay∣ed, degenerated, and apostatized. The Word, the Rule of Worship, was rejected of them, and in its place they had set up their own Traditions, they had rejected also the most weighty Ordinances, &amp; put in the room thereof their own little things (<HI>Mat.</HI> 15. <HI>Mark</HI> 7.) <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was therefore now greatly back slidden, and become the place where Truth and true Religion was much defaced.</P>
<P>It was also now become the very sink of Sin, the seat of Hypocrisie, &amp; the Gulf where true Religion was drowned: Here also now reigned Presumption and ground∣less
<PB N="4" REF="003637_0005_10023A39A5CC3560"/>
Confidence in GOD, which is the bane of Souls. Amongst its Rulers, Doctors and Leaders, Envy, Malice, &amp; Blasphemy vented it self against the Power of Godli∣ness, in all places where it was espied: As also against the Promoters of it; yea their Lord and Maker could not escape them.</P>
<P>In a word, <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was now become the Shambles, the very Slaughter-shop for Saints. This was the place wherein the Prophets, Christ, and his People, were most horribly persecuted and murdered. Yea, so hardned at this time was <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in her Sins, that she feared not to commit the biggest, and to bind her self by Wish, under the Guilt and damning Evil of it; saying, when she had murdered the Son of God, <HI>His blood be upon us and our Children.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> did both by Doct∣rine, Miracles, and Holiness of Life, seek to put a stop to their Villanies; yet they shut their Eyes, stop their Ears, and rested not, till (as was hinted before) they had driven him out of the World. Yea that they might, if possible, have extinguished his Name, and exploded his Doctrine out of the World; they against all Arguments, and in despite of heaven, its mighty Hand, and undeniable Proof of his Resurrection; did hire Souldiers to invent a lye, saying, <HI>his Disciples stole him away from the Grave</HI>; on purpose that Men might not count him
<PB N="5" REF="003637_0005_10023A39A5CC3560"/>
the Saviour of the World, nor trust in him for the Remission of Sins.</P>
<P>They were, saith <HI>Paul,</HI> contrary to all Men: For they did not only shut up the Door of Life against themselves; but forbid that it should be opened to any else. <HI>For∣bidding us,</HI> saith he, <HI>to preach to the Gen∣tiles, that they might be saved, to fill up their Sin always, Mat.</HI> 23.35. <HI>Chap.</HI> 15 7, 8, 9. <HI>Mark</HI> 7.6, 7, 8. <HI>Matth.</HI> 3. <HI>to</HI> 9. <HI>John</HI> 8.33, 41. <HI>Matth.</HI> 27.18. <HI>Mark</HI> 3.30. <HI>Luke</HI> 2.65. <HI>Matth.</HI> 23.37. <HI>Luke</HI> 13.33, 34. <HI>Psal.</HI> 2.22, 23. <HI>Psal.</HI> 4.10. <HI>Matth.</HI> 27, 25. <HI>Ch.</HI> 20.11, <HI>to the</HI> 15.1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2, 14 15 16.</P>
<P>This is the City, and these are the Peo∣ple, this is their Character, and these are their Sins. Nor can there be produced their parallel in all this World. Nay, what World, what People, what Nation, for Sin and Transgression, could, or can be com∣pared to <HI>Jerusalem</HI>! Especially if you ioyn to the matter of Fact, the Light they sin∣ned against, and the Patience which they abused. Infinite was the Wickedness up∣on this Account which they committed.</P>
<P>After all their Abusings of wise Men, &amp; Prophets, God sent unto them <HI>John Bap∣tist,</HI> to reduce them, and then his Son to redeem them; but they would be neither reduced nor redeemed, but persecuted both to the Death. Nor did they as I sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, stop here; the Holy Apostles they afterwards
<PB N="6" REF="003637_0006_10023A56835103A8"/>
persecuted also to Death, even so many as they could, the rest they drove from them unto the utmost Corners.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I come now to show you what it was to preach the Gospel to them. It was, saith <HI>Luke,</HI> to preach to them <HI>Re∣pentance and Remission of Sins in Christ's Name.</HI> Or as <HI>Mark</HI> has it, <HI>to bid them repent and believe the Gospel.</HI> Mark 1.15. Not that Repentance is a Cause of Remis∣sion, but a Sign of our hearty Reception thereof. Repentance is therefore here put to intimate, that no pretended Faith of the Gospel is good, that is not accompanied wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> And this he doth or purpose, be∣cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould not have them deceive th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> For with what Faith can he exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mon of Sins in the name of Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is not heartily sor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y for them? O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w shall a Man be able to give to o∣the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>factory Account of his unfeign∣ed Subjection to the Gospel that yet abides in his Impenitency?</P>
<P>Wherefore Repentance is here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oined with F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th in the way of receiving the Gospel, Faith is that without which it cannot be received at all: And Repentance, without which it cannot be received unfeignedly. When therefore Christ says he would have Repentance and Remission of Sins preached in his Name among all Nations▪ it is as much as to say, <HI>I will that all Men every
<PB N="7" REF="003637_0006_10023A56835103A8"/>
where be sorry for their Sins, and accept of Mercy at God's hand, thro' me, lest they fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l under his Wrath in the Judgment.</HI> For, as I said, without Repentance what Pretence soever Men have of Faith, they cannot escape the Wrath to come; where∣fore <HI>Paul</HI> saith, <HI>God Commands all Men every where to repent</HI> (in order to their Salvation) <HI>because he hath appointed a Day in the which he will Judge the World in Righteousness by that Man whom he hath ordained, Acts</HI> 17.30.</P>
<P>And now to come to this <HI>Clause, Be∣ginning at Jerusalem</HI>: That is, that Christ would have <HI>Jerusalem</HI> have the first offer of the Gospel.</P>
<P N="1">1. This cannot be so commanded, be∣cause they had any more Right for them∣selves thereto▪ than had any of the Nations of the World; for their Sins had divested them of all Self-deservings.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor yet, because they stood upon the <HI>advance Ground</HI> with the worst of the Sin∣ners of the Nations, Nay, rather the Sin∣ners of the Nations, had the <HI>advance Ground</HI> of them: For <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was long before she had added this Iniquity to her Sin, worse than the very Nations that God cast out before the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 33.</P>
<P N="3">3. It must therefore follow that the <HI>clause begun at Jerusalem</HI> was put into this Com∣mission
<PB N="8" REF="003637_0007_10023A42CB37FE78"/>
of meer Grace and Compassion: Even from the overflowing of the Bowels of Mercy: For indeed they were the worst, and so in the most deplorable Condition of any People under the Heaven.</P>
<P>Whatever therefore their Relation was to <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> or <HI>Jacob,</HI> however they formerly had been the People among whom God had placed his Name and Wor∣ship; they were now degenerated from God more than the Nations were from their Idols, and were become Guilty of the highest Sins which the People of the World were capable of committing. Nay none can be capable of committing of such un∣pardonable Sins they committed against their God, when they slew his Son, and persecuted his Name and Word.</P>
<P>From these Words therefore, thus ex∣plained, we gain this Observation,</P>
<P>That Jesus Christ would have Mercy offer'd in the first place to the biggest Sinners.</P>
<P>That these <HI>Jerusalem</HI> Sinners were the biggest that ever were in the World, I think none will deny, that believes that Christ was the best Man that ever was in the World, and also was their Lord God. And that they were to have the first offer of his Grace, the Text is as clear as the Sun; for it saith, <HI>Begin at Jerusalem. Preach,</HI> saith he, <HI>Repentance &amp; Remission of Sins, in the first place to the Jerusalem Sinners.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003637_0007_10023A42CB37FE78"/>One would have thought, since the <HI>Je∣rusalem Sinners</HI> were the worst, and great∣est Sinners, Christ's greatest Enemies, and those that not only despised his Person, Doctrine, &amp; Miracles, but that a little be∣fore had had their Hands up to their El∣bows in his Hearts Blood. That he should rather have said, Go into all the World, &amp; preach Repentance and Remission of Sins among all Nations, and after that, the same to <HI>Jerusalem</HI>: Yea, it had been infinite Grace if he had said so: But what Grace is this? Or what Name shall we give it, when he Commands that this Re∣pentance and Remission of Sins which is designed to be preached in all Nations, should first be offered to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> the worst of Sinners?</P>
<P>Nor was this the first time that the Grace which was in the Heart of Christ, thus shewed it self to the World. For while he was yet alive, even while He was yet in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and perceived, even among those <HI>Jerusalem Sinners,</HI> which was the most vile amongst them, he still in his preaching did signifie that he had a Desire that the worst of these worst should in the first place come unto him. The which he sheweth, where he saith to the better sort of them. The <HI>Publicans &amp; Harlots en∣ter into the Kingdom of God before you, Mat.</HI> 21.13. Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> when he compared
<PB N="10" REF="003637_0008_10023A7DC8F54DF0"/>
<HI>Jerusalem</HI> with the Sinners of the Nation he then Commands that the <HI>Jerusalem Sinners</HI> should have the Gospel at present confined to them. <HI>Go not,</HI> saith he, <HI>into the way of the Gentiles▪ and into any of the Cities of the Samaritans enter ye not: But go rather to the lost Sheep of the House of Israel</HI> Mat. 10.5, 6. Chap. 23.37. But go <HI>rather</HI> to them, for they were in the most fearful <HI>plight.</HI></P>
<P>These therefore must have the <HI>Cream</HI> of the Gospel, namely, the first <HI>offer</HI> thereof in his Life-time: Yea, when he departed out of the World, he left this as part of his last Will with his Preachers, that they also should offer it <HI>first</HI> to <HI>Jeru∣salem.</HI> He had a mind, as it seems, to priviledge the worst of Sinners with the first offer of Mercy; and to take from a∣mong <HI>them,</HI> a People to be the first Fruits unto GOD and to the LAMB. The 15th of <HI>Luke</HI> also is famous for this, Where the Lord Jesus takes more Care, as ap∣pears here by three Parables, for the lost Sheep, lost Groat, and the Prodigal Son, than for the other Sheep, the other Pence, or for the Son that said he had never transgressed. Yea, he shews that there is Joy in Heaven, among the Angels of GOD, at the Repentance of one Sinner, more than over Ninety and Nine Just Persons, which need no Repentance, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003637_0008_10023A7DC8F54DF0"/>After this manner therefore the Mind of CHRIST was set on the Salvation of the biggest Sinners in his Life-time. But join to this, <HI>this</HI> Clause, which he care∣fully put into the Apostles Commission to preach, when he departed hence to the Father, and then you shall see that his, Heart was vehemently set upon it; for these were part of his last Words with them, <HI>Preach the Gospel to all Nations, but see that you do begin at Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>Nor did the Apostles overlook this Clause, when their Lord was gone into Heaven: They went first to them of <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> &amp; Preached Christ's Gospel to them. They abode also there for a Season, and preached it to no body else, for they had re∣gard to the Commandments of their Lord.</P>
<P>And it is to be observed, namely, that the first Sermon which they preached, was to the very worst of these <HI>Jerusalem Sinners</HI>; even to those that were the Murderers of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> Acts 2.23. For these are part of the Sermon: <HI>Ye took him and by wicked Hands have Crucified and slain him.</HI> Yea, the three next Sermons was preached to the self-same Murderers, to the end they might be saved, <HI>Acts</HI> 3.14.</P>
<P>But we will return to the first Sermon that was preached to those <HI>Jerusalem Sin∣ners,</HI> by which will be manifest more than great Grace, if it be duly considered.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003637_0009_10023A519F211DC0"/>For after that <HI>Peter</HI> and the rest of the Apostles, had in their Exhortation per∣swaded these Wretches to believe that they had killed the Prince of Life. And after they had duly fallen under the guilt of their Murder, saying, <HI>Men and Bre∣thren what shall we do</HI>? He replies by an universal Tender to them all in general, considering them as <HI>Christ</HI>'s killers, <HI>That if they were sorry for what they had done, and would be Baptized for the Re∣mission of their Sins in his Name, they should receive the Gift of the Holy Ghost,</HI> Acts 2.37, 38.</P>
<P>This he said to them all, tho' he knew that they were such Sinners: Yea, he said it without the least Stick, or Stop or Pause of Spirit, as to whether he had best to say so, or no. Nay, so far of was <HI>Peter</HI> from making an Objection against one of them, that by a particular Clause in his Exhortation, he endeavours that not one of them may escape the Salvation offered. <HI>Repent,</HI> saith he, <HI>and be Baptized every one of you.</HI> I shut out <HI>never a one of you.</HI> For I am commanded by my Lord to deal with you; as it were one by one, by the Word of his Salvation. But why speaks he so particularly? Oh! There were Reason for it: The People with whom the Apostles were now to deal, as they were Murderers of our Lord, and to be
<PB N="13" REF="003637_0009_10023A519F211DC0"/>
charged in the general with his Blood, so they had their Various and Particular Acts of Villiany in the Guilt thereof, now ly∣ing upon their Consciences. And the Guilt of these their Various and Particular Acts of Wickedness, could not perhaps, be preached to a removal thereof, but by this particular Application.

How willing was <HI>Peter</HI> and his Lord <HI>Jesus</HI> by his Ministry, to catch these Murderers with the Word of the Gospel, that they might be made <HI>Monuments</HI> of the Grace of GOD! How unwilling, I say was he, that any of these should escape the Hand of Mercy! Yea, what an amazing Wonder is it, to think that above all the World, and above every body in it, These should have the first offer of Mercy, <HI>begining at Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="003637_0010_10023A6F3055B010"/>But was there not something of Mo∣ment in this Clause of the Commission? Did not <HI>Peter</HI> think you see a great deal in it, that he should thus begin with these Men, and thus offer, so particular, this Grace to each particular Man of them?</P>
<P>But, as I told you, This is not all, these <HI>Jerusalem Sinners</HI> must have this offer again and again? <HI>Every one of them</HI> must be offered it over and over. CHRIST would not take the first Rejection for a Denial; nor their second Repulse for a Denial: But he will have Grace offered once, and twice, and thrice to these <HI>Jerusalem Sinners.</HI> Is not this amazing Grace, CHRIST will not be put off? These are the Sinners that are Sinners indeed. They are Sinners of the biggest sort, consequently such as CHRIST can, if they Convert and be saved, best serve his Ends and Designs upon, of which more anon.</P>
<P>But what a pitch of Grace is this? CHRIST is minded to amaze the World, and to show that he acted not like the Children of Men. This is that which he said of Old, <Q>I will not execute the Fierceness of my Wrath, I will not return to destroy <HI>Ephraim,</HI> for I am GOD and not Man, <HI>Hos.</HI> 11.9.</Q> This is not the manner of Men, Men are shorter winded, Men are soon moved to take Vengence
<PB N="16" REF="003637_0011_10023A65692D4A50"/>
and to right themselves in a way of Wroth and Indignation; but GOD is full of Grace full of Patience, ready to forgive and one that delights in Mercy: All this, is seen in our Text, the biggest Sinners must first be offered Mercy; they must I say, have the Cream of the Gospel offered unto them.</P>
<P>But we will proceed. In the Third Chapter we find, that they who escaped converting by the first Sermon, are called upon again to except of Grace and For∣giveness for their Murder committed up∣on the Son of God. You have killed; yea, <HI>you have denied the Holy On▪ &amp; the Just, an I desired the Murderer to be granted unto you. And killed the Prince of Life. Mark,</HI> he falls again upon the very Men, that actually were, as you have it in the Chapters following, his very <HI>Betrayers and Murderers.</HI> Acts 2.14.15. as being loth that they should escape the Mercy of Forgiveness. And Exhorts them again to repent, <HI>that their Sins may be blotted out,</HI> Verse 19, 20.</P>
<P>Again in the fourth Chapter, he char∣ges them afresh with this Murder. Verse 10. But withall tells them, <HI>Salvation is in no other</HI> than like a heavenly Decoy, He puts himself also among them, to draw them the better under the Net of the Gospel, saying, <HI>There is none other Name under He even given among Men, whereby we must be saved,</HI> Verse 12.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="003637_0011_10023A65692D4A50"/>In the fifth Chapter you find them Railing at him, because he continued Preaching among them Salvation in the Name of <HI>Jesus</HI>; but he tells them, that that very <HI>Jesus</HI> whom they had slain and hanged on a Tree, him GOD had raised up and exalted to be Prince, and a Savi∣our, to give Repentance to <HI>Israel,</HI> and Forgiveness of Sins, ver. 29, 30, 31. Still insinuating, that tho' they had killed him and to this Day rejected him, yet his Bu∣siness was to bestow upon them Repen∣tance and Forgiveness of Sins.</P>
<P>'Tis true, after they had began to kill again, &amp; when nothing but killing would serve their turn then they that were scattered abroad, went every where prea∣ching the Word. Yet even some of them so hankered after the Conversion of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that they preached the Gospel on∣ly to them. Also the Apostles still made their Abode at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in hopes that they might let down their Net for ano∣ther Draught of these <HI>Jerusalem Sinners.</HI> Neither did <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> who were the Ministers of GOD to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> but offer the Gospel in the first place to those of them that for their Wickedness were scattered like Vagabonds among the Nations: Yea, and when they rendred Rebellion and Blasphemy for their Service and Love; they Replied, <HI>It was Neces∣sary
<PB N="18" REF="003637_0012_10023A5D108998C8"/>
that the Word of God should first have been spoken to them,</HI> Acts 1.8. Ch. 13.46, 47.</P>
<P>Nor was this their preaching Unsuc∣cessful among these People: But the Lord <HI>Jesus</HI> so wrought with the Word <HI>thus</HI> spoken, that Thousands of them came flocking to him for Mercy. Three Thou∣sand of them closed with him at the first and afterwards Two Thousand more; for now they were in Number about Five Thousand; whereas before these Sermons were preached to these Murderers; the Number of the Desciples were <HI>not above an Hundred and Twenty,</HI> Acts 1.15. Ch. 2.41 Ch. 4.4.</P>
<P>Also among these People that thus flocked to him for Mercy, there was a <HI>great Company of the Priests</HI> Chap. 6.7. Now the Priests were they that were the greatest of these biggest Sinners; they were the Ring-leaders, they were the Inventors &amp; Ring-leaders in the Mischief. 'Twas they set the People against the Lord <HI>Jesus,</HI> and that was the cause why the Uproar in∣creased, until <HI>Pilate</HI> had given Sentance upon him. <HI>The chief Priests and Elders,</HI> says the Text perswaded (the People) the Multitude, that they should ask <HI>Barabas,</HI> and destroy <HI>Jesus, Matth.</HI> 27 20. And yet behold the Priests, yea, a great Company of the Priests, became obedient to the Faith.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="003637_0012_10023A5D108998C8"/>Oh! the greatness of the Grace of <HI>Christ</HI>! That he should be thus in Love with the Souls of the <HI>Jerusalem Sinners</HI>; That he should be thus delighted with the Sal∣vation of the <HI>Jerusalem Sinners,</HI> that he should not only will that his Gospel should be offered them, but that it should be of∣fered unto them first, and before other Sin∣ners were admitted to a hearing of it; <HI>Begin at Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Was this Doctrine well believed where would there be place for a Doubt or a Fear of the Damnation of the Soul, if the Sin∣ner be Penitent, How bad a Life soever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e has lived, how many soever in Num∣ber are his Sins</HI>?</P>
<P>But this Grace is hid from the Eyes of Men, the Devil hides it from them, for he knows it is alluring? He knows it has an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttracting Virtue in it. For this is it, that above all Argumenes can draw the Soul to God.</P>

<P>Thus you see I have pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the Doct¦<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine; and that not only by shewing you

<P>Yea, it is yet further manifested, in tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when his Ministers first began to preach to others, he joyned his Power to the Word, to the converting of Thousands of his Be∣trayers and Murderers; and also many o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Ring-leading Priest to the Faith.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed, and shall shew you,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Reason of the point.</P>
<P N="2">2. And then make some Application of the whole.</P>
<P>The Observation you know is this, <HI>Jesu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ would have Mercy offered in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first place to the biggest Sinners, to the Je¦rusalem Sinners: Preach Repentance &amp; Remission of Sins in my Name among a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>The Reasons of the Point are,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Because the biggest Sinners hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most need thereof. He that has most need Reason says, should be helped first: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mean, when a helping Hand is offered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now it is. For the Gospel of the Grac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God is sent to help the World, <HI>Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 16.9. But the biggest Sinner has mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> need. Therefore in Reason, when Merc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is sent down from Heaven to Men, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worst of Men should have the first Off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="21" REF="003637_0013_10023A88EBF904E0"/>
of it: <HI>Begin at Jerusalem:</HI> This is the Reason which the Lord <HI>Christ</HI> himself ren∣ders, why in his Life time he left the best, and turned him to the worst; why he sat so loose from the Righteous and stuck so close to the Wicked, <HI>The whole</HI> saith he, <HI>have no need of the Physician, but the sick, I came not to call the Righteous, but sinners to repentance,</HI> Mark 2.15, 16, 17.</P>
<P>Above you read, that the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees</HI> said to his Disciples: <HI>How is it, that he eateth and drinketh with Publi∣cans &amp; Sinners</HI>? Alas they did not know the Reason. But the Lord renders them one, and such an one, as is both natural and cogent; saying, <HI>These</HI> have <HI>need most need.</HI> Their great Necessity requires that I should be most friendly and shew my Grace first to them.</P>
<P><HI>Not that the other were Sinless, and so had no need of a Saviour: But the Publi∣cans, and their Companions, were the big∣gest Sinners, they were, as to View, worse than the</HI> Scribes, <HI>and therefore in Reason should be helped first, because they had most need of a Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>Men that are at the Point to die, have more need of the Physician, than they that are but now and then troubled with an Heart fainting qualm. The Publicans and Sinners, were, as it were, in the mouth of Death, Death was swallowing of them
<PB N="22" REF="003637_0014_10023A8B4DF447E8"/>
down; and therefore the Lord <HI>Jesus</HI> re¦ceives them first, offers them Mercy first <HI>The whole have no need of the Physician, but the Sick. I came not to call the Righ∣teous but Sinners to Repentance.</HI> The Sick, as I said, is the biggest Sinner, whether he sees his Diseases or not. He is stained from Head to Foot, from Heart to Life and Conversation: This Man in every Man's Judgment, has the most need of Mercy▪ There is nothing attends him from Bed to Board, and from Board to Bed again, but the visible Characters, and obvious Symp∣toms of eternal Damnation. This there∣fore is the Man that has need, most need, and therefore in Reason should be helped in the first place. Thus 'twas with the People concerned in the Text, they were <HI>the worst of Sinners, Jerusalem Sinners,</HI> Sinners of the biggest size. And therefore such as had the greatest need, wherefore they must have Mercy offered to them, before it be offered any where in the World, <HI>Begin at Jerusalem.</HI> Offer Mercy first to a <HI>Jerusalem Sinner</HI>: This man has most need, he is farthest from God, nearest to Hell, and so one that has <HI>most need.</HI> This Mans Sins are in <HI>number</HI> the <HI>most,</HI> in <HI>cry</HI> the <HI>loudest,</HI> in <HI>weight</HI> the <HI>heaviest,</HI> and con∣sequently will sink him soonest wherefore he has most need of Mercy: This Man is shut up in Satans hand, fastest bound in
<PB N="23" REF="003637_0014_10023A8B4DF447E8"/>
the cords of his sins; One that Justice is whetting his Sword to cut off, and there∣fore has most need, not only of Mercy, but that it should be extended to him in the first place.</P>
<P>But a little further, to shew you the true nature of this Reason, to wit, <HI>That Jesus Christ would have Mercy offer'd in the first place to the biggest sinners.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Mercy ariseth from Bowels and Compassion, from Pity, and from a feel∣ing of the Condition of those in misery. <HI>In his Love and in his Pity, he saveth us.</HI> And again, <HI>The Lord is pitiful, very piti∣ful, &amp; of tender Mercy,</HI> Isa. 63 9. Jam. 5.11.</P>
<P>Now where Pity and Compassion is, there is yearning of Bowels, and where there is that, there is a Readiness to help. And, I say again, the more Deplorable and Dreadful the Condition is, the more di∣rectly doth Bowels and Compassion turn themselves to such: And offer Help and Deliverance. All this flows from our first Scripture Proof, <HI>I came to call them that have Need,</HI> to call them first, while the rest look on, and Murmur.</P>
<P><HI>How shall I give thee up Ephraim? E∣phraim</HI> was a Revolter from God, a Man that had given himself up to Devilism: a Company of Men, the Ten Tribes that Worshipped Devils, while <HI>Judah</HI> kept with his God. But <HI>how should I give thee
<PB N="24" REF="003637_0015_10023A7130F09850"/>
up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim</HI> (and yet thou art worse than they,) nor has <HI>Samaria com∣mitted half thy sins,</HI> Ezek. 16.46 <HI>to</HI> 51. <HI>My Heart is turned within me, and my Repentings are kindled together,</HI> Hos. 11.8</P>
<P>But where do you find that ever the Lord did thus rowl in his Bowels for, and after any Self righteous Man? No, no, they are the Publicans and Harlots, Idolaters and <HI>Jerusalem Sinners,</HI> for whom his Bowels thus yearn and tumble about with∣in him, For, alas poor Worms, they have most Need of Mercy.</P>
<P>Had not that good <HI>Samaritan</HI> more Compassion for that Man that fell among Thieves, (tho' that Fall was occasioned by his going from the place where they worshiped God, to <HI>Jericho,</HI> the cursed Ci∣ty) than we read he had for any other be∣sides? His <HI>Wine</HI> was for him, his <HI>Oyl</HI> was for him, his <HI>Beast</HI> for him, his <HI>Penny,</HI> his <HI>Care,</HI> and his <HI>Swadling hands</HI> for him; for alas, poor Wretch, he had most Need, <HI>Luke</HI> 10.30 <HI>to</HI> 35.</P>
<P><HI>Zacheus</HI> the Publican, the chief of the Publicans, one that had made himself the richer by wronging of others; the Lord at that time singleth him out from all the rest of his Brother Publicans, and that in the Face of many Pharisees, proclaimed in
<PB N="25" REF="003637_0015_10023A7130F09850"/>
the Audience of them all, That that Day Salvation was come to his House, <HI>Luke</HI> 19. 1 <HI>to</HI> 8.</P>
<P>The Woman also that had been bowed down by Satan for Eighteen Years toge∣ther, his Compassion putting him upon it, he loosed her tho' those that stood by snarled at him for so doing, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.11, 12, 13.</P>
<P>And why the Woman of <HI>Sarepta,</HI> and why <HI>Naaman</HI> the <HI>Syrian,</HI> rather than o∣ther Widows and Lepers in <HI>Israel,</HI> but be∣cause their Conditions were more deplora∣ble (for that) they were most forlorn, and farthest from Help? <HI>Luke</HI> 4.25.27.</P>
<P>But I say, why all these thus named? Why have we not a Catalogue of some holy Men that were so in their own Eyes, and in the Judgment of the World? Alas if at any time any of them are mentioned, how seemingly coldly doth the Record of Scripture present them to us. <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> a Night Professor, and <HI>Simon</HI> the Pharisee with his Fifty Pence, and their great Ig∣norance of the Methods of Grace, we have now and then touched upon.</P>
<P>Mercy seems to be out of its proper Channel when it deals with Self righteous Men; but then it runs with a full Stream, when it extends it self to the biggest Sinners. As God's Mercy is not regulated by Man's Goodness, nor obtained by Man's Worthi∣ness
<PB N="26" REF="003637_0016_10023A58D98664B0"/>
so not much set out by saving of any such; but more of this anon.</P>
<P>And here let me ask my <HI>Reader</HI> a Question: Suppose, that as thou art walk∣ing by some Pond-side; thou shouldest espy in it, four or five Children all in danger of drowning, and one in more Danger than all the rest; judge which has most Need to be helped out first? I know thou wilt say, he that is nearest drowning; Why this is the Case: the bigger Sinner, the nearer drowning; therefore the bigger Sinner, the more need of Mercy: Yea, of help by Mercy in the first Place. And to this our Text agrees, when it saith, <HI>Beginning at Jerusalem:</HI> Let the <HI>Jeru∣salem sinner,</HI> says Christ, have the first Offer, the first Invitation, the first tender of my Grace and Mercy, for he is the biggest Sin∣ner, and so has most Need thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Christ Jesus would have Mer∣cy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners, because when they or any of them receive it, it redounds most to the Fame of his Name.</P>
<P>Christ Jesus, as you may perceive, has put himself under the term of a Physician, a Doctor for curing of Diseases: And you know that Applause and a Fame, is a thing that Physicians much desire. That is it that helps them to Patients, and that also that will help their Patients to commit
<PB N="27" REF="003637_0016_10023A58D98664B0"/>
themselves to their Skill for Cure, with the more confidence and repose of Spirit; and the way for a Doctor or Physician to get themselves a Name, is in the first place to take in hand, and cure some such as all others have given off for lost and dead: Physicians get neither Name nor Fame, by picking of <HI>Weeds</HI> or picking out <HI>Thisties,</HI> or by laying of Plaisters to the <HI>scratch</HI> of a <HI>Pin</HI>: Every old Woman can do this: But if they will have a Name and a Fame, if they will have it quickly they must, as I said, do some great and desperate Cures: Let them fetch one to Life that was dead, let them recover one to his Wits that was Mad, let them make one that was born Blind to see, or let them give ripe Wits to a Fool; these are nota∣ble Cures, and he that can do thus, and if he doth thus first, he shall have the <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Fame</HI> he desires, he may lie a Bed till Noon.</P>
<P><HI>Why</HI> Christ Jesus <HI>forgiveth Sins for a Name, and so begets of himself a good Re∣port in the Hearts of the Children of Men: And therefore in Reason must be willing, as also he did command that his Mercy should be offered first to the biggest sinners.</HI></P>
<P>I will forgive their Sins, Iniquities, and Transgressions, <HI>says he,</HI> and it shall turn to me for a Name of Joy, and a Praise, and an Honour, before all the Nations of the Earth, <HI>Jer.</HI> 33.8, 9.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="003637_0017_10023A7418775610"/><HI>And hence it is that at his first appear∣ing, he took upon him to do such mighty Works; He got a Fame thereby</HI> Mat 4 23.</P>
<P>When <HI>Christ</HI> had cast the Legion of De∣vils out of the Man of whom you read, <HI>Mark</HI> 5. He bid him go home to his Friends and tell it; <HI>Go home,</HI> saith he, to <HI>thy Friends, and tell them how great things God has done for thee; and has had Compassion on thee,</HI> Mark 5.19. <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> seeks a Name, and desireth a Fame in the World, and, therefore, the better to obtain that, he commands that Mercy should first be proffered to the biggest Sin∣ners; because by the saving of one of them he makes all Men marvel. As 'tis said of the Man last mentioned, whom <HI>Christ</HI> cu∣red toward the beginning of his Ministry: <HI>And he departed,</HI> says the Text, <HI>and be∣gan to publish in</HI> Decapolis <HI>how great things Jesus had done for him, and all Men did mar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el,</HI> Ver. 20.</P>
<P>When <HI>John</HI> told <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hrist,</HI> that they saw one casting out Devils in his Name, and they forbad him, because he followed not with them: What is the Answer of <HI>Christ Forbid him not, for there is no Man which shall do a Miracle in my Name, that can lightly sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k evil of me.</HI> No they will rather cause his Praise to be heard and his Name to be Magnify'd, and so put Glory on the Head of Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="003637_0017_10023A7418775610"/>But we will follow a little our Metaphor, Christ as I said, has put himself under the Term of a Physician, Consequently he de∣sireth that his Fame as to the Salvation of Sinners may spread abroad, that the World may see what he can do. And to this end, has not only commanded that the biggest Sinners should have the first offer of his Mercy; but has, as Physicians do, put out his Bills, and published his Doings, that things may be read and talked of: Yea, he has moreover in these his blessed Bills, the holy Scriptures, I mean, inserted in the very Names of Persons the places of their Abode, and the great Cures, that by the Means of his Salvation he has wrought upon them to this very end. Here is <HI>Item,</HI> such a one by my Grace and redeeming Blood, was made a Monument of everlas∣ting Life; and such a one by my perfect Obedience, became an Heir of Glory: And then he produceth their Names.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> I saved <HI>Lot,</HI> from the Guilt and Damnation that he had procured to him∣self by his <HI>Inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> I saved <HI>David</HI> from the Vengeance that belonged to him for committing of Adultery and Murder.</P>
<P>Here is also <HI>Soloman, Manasseh, Peter, Magdalen,</HI> and many others made menti∣on of in this Book. Yea, here are their Names, their Sins, and their Salvations re∣corded
<PB N="30" REF="003637_0018_10023A699F7CAF28"/>
together, that you may read and know what a Saviour he is; and do him Honour in the World: For why are these things thus recorded, but to shew to Sin∣ners what he can do, to the Praise and Glory of his Grace.</P>
<P>And it is observable, as I said before, we have but very little of the Salvation of little Sinners mentioned in God's Book, because that would not have answered the Design, to wit, to bring Glory and Fame to the Name of the Son of God.</P>
<P>What should be the Reason think you, why Christ should so easily take a denial of the great ones, that were the Grandeur of the World, and struggle so hard for Hedge-creepers and High Way Men, (as the Parable, <HI>Luke</HI> 14 seems to import he doth) but to shew forth the riches of the Glory of his Grace, to his Praise? This I say, is one Reason to be sure,</P>
<P>They that had their Grounds, their yoke of Oxen, and their Marriage Joys were in∣vited to come; but they made their Excuse, and that served the turn, But when he comes to deal with the worst, he saith to his Servant, Go ye <HI>out</HI> and <HI>bring</HI> them in hither, <HI>Go out quickly and bring in hither the poor, the maimed, the halt and the blind: And they did so.</HI> And he said again, <HI>Go out into the high ways &amp; hedg∣es, and compel them to come in, that my

<P>When <HI>Christ</HI> was crucified and hanged up between the Earth and Heavens, there were two Thieves crucified with him; and behold, he lays hold of one of them, and will have him away with him to Glo∣ry. Was not this a strange act, and a dis∣play of unthought of Grace? Were there none but Thieves there, or were the rest of that Company out of his reach? Could he not think you, have stooped from the Cross to the Ground, and have laid hold on some honester Man if he would? Yes doubtless: Oh, but then he would not have displayed his Grace, nor so have pursued his own designs; namely to get himself a praise, and a Name: But how he has done it to purpose. For, who that shall read this Story, but must confess that the Son of God is full of Grace? For a proof of the riches thereof he left behind him when upon the Cross; he took the Thief away with him to Glory. <HI>Nor can this one act of his be buried</HI>: It will be talked of to the end of the World to his Praise, <HI>Men shall speak of the might of thy terrible Acts, and will declare thy Great∣ness: They shall abundantly utter the

Memory of thy great Goodness, and shall sing of thy Righteousness: They shall speak of the Glory of thy Kingdom, and talk of thy Power. To make known to the sons of Men, his mighty Acts, and the glori∣ous Majesty of his Kingdom,</HI> Psal. 145.6, <HI>to</HI> 12.</P>
<P>When the Word of God came among the Conjurers and those Sooth-sayers tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you read of, <HI>Acts</HI> 19. and had prevailed with some of them, of the Grace of <HI>Christ</HI>▪ the Holy Ghost records it with a boast, for that it would redound to his Praise.</P>
<P>And many of them that use curious Arts, brought their Books together and burned them before all Men; and count∣ed the Price of them, and found it fifty Thousand pieces of Silver; so mightily grew the Word of God and prevailed <HI>Acts</HI> 19.19, 20. It wrenched out of the Clutches of Satan, some of those of whom he thought himself most sure; so mightily grew the Word of God. It grew mightily, it incroached upon the King∣dom of the Devil! It pursued him and took the prey: It forced him to let go his hold: It brought away Captive, as Prisoners taken by Force of Arms, some of the most valiant of his Army. It fetch back from, as it were the confines of Hell, some of those that were his trusty Slaves and that with Hell had been at an Agree∣ment:
<PB N="33" REF="003637_0019_10023A5FDEB10670"/>
It made them come and confess their Deeds, and burn their Books before all Men; so mightily grew the Word of God, and prevailed.</P>
<P>Thus therefore you s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o why Christ will have Mercy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners. They have most need thereof; and this is the most ready way to extol his Name that rideth upon the Hea∣vens, to our Help.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Christ Jesus would have Mer∣cy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners, because by their Forgiveness and Salvation, others hearing of it, will be en∣couraged the more to come to him for Life.</P>
<P>For the Physician, by curing of the most desperate at the first, doth not only get himself a Name; but begets Encourage∣ment in the minds of other diseased Folk, to come to him for Help: Hence you read of our Lord, that after thro' his tender Mercy, he had cured many of great Disea∣ses, his Fame was spread abroad: <HI>They brought unto him all sick People that were taken with divers Diseases and Torments; and those that were possessed with Devils, and those that had the Palsy, and he healed them; and there followed him a great multitude of People from</HI> Galilee <HI>and</HI> Decapolis <HI>and</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>and</HI> Judea, <HI>and from beyond</HI> Jordan, <HI>Mat.</HI> 4 24, 25.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="003637_0020_10023A869504C878"/>See here, He first by working gets him∣self a Fame, a Name, and Renown; and now Men take Encouragement, and bring from all quarters their Diseased to him, be∣ing helped by what they had heard, to be∣lieve that their Diseases should be healed.</P>
<P>Now, as he did with those outward Cures, so he does in the proffers of his Grace and Mercy; he proffers that in the first Place to the biggest Sinners, that others may take Heart to come to be saved. I will give you a Scripture or two, I mean to shew you that Christ by commanding that his Mercy should in the first place be offered to the biggest of Sinners, has a Design thereby to encourage and provoke others to come also to him for Mercy.</P>
<P><HI>God,</HI> saith Paul, <HI>who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in our Sins, hath quickned us together with Christ (by Grace ye are saved) and hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.</HI> But why did he do all this? <HI>That in the Ages to come, he might shew the exceeding Riches of his Grace, in his Kindness towards us, thro' Christ Jesus,</HI> Ephes. 2 4, 5, 6, 7.</P>
<P>See here a Design, God lets out his Mercy to <HI>Ephesus</HI> on Design, even to shew to the Ages to come, the exceeding Riches of his Grave in his Kindness to them thro'
<PB N="35" REF="003637_0020_10023A869504C878"/>
Christ Jesus; and why to shew by these the exceeding Riches of his Grace to the Ages to come thro' Christ Jesus? But to allure them and their Children also to come to him, and to partake of the same Grace thro' Christ Jesus.</P>
<P>But what was <HI>Paul</HI> and the <HI>Ephesian-sinners</HI>? (of <HI>Paul</HI> we will speak anon.) These <HI>Ephesian sinners,</HI> They were Men dead in Sins, Men that walked according to the Dictates and Motions of the Devil, Worshippers of <HI>Diana,</HI> that effeminate Goddess; Men far off from God, Aliens and Stranger to all good Things, such as were far off from that as I said, and conse∣quently in a most deplorable Condition; as the <HI>Jerusalem sinners,</HI> &amp;c Condition; as the <HI>Jerusalem sinners</HI> were of the high∣est Sort among the <HI>Jews,</HI> so these <HI>Ephe∣sian sinners</HI> were of the highest sort among the <HI>Ephesians, Gentiles (Eph.</HI> 2.1, 2, 3. <HI>Acts</HI> 19.35.2.11.31.)</P>
<P>Wherefore as by the <HI>Jerusalem sinners,</HI> in saving them▪ first, he had a design to provoke others to come to him for Mercy; so the same Design is here set on foot again, in his calling and converting the <HI>Ephesi∣an-sinners,</HI> that in the Ages to come he might shew the exceeding Riches of his Grace! Says he, <HI>in his Kindness towards us thro' Christ Jesus.</HI> There is yet one hint behind. 'Tis said that God saved
<PB N="36" REF="003637_0021_10023A82992D09B0"/>
these for <HI>his Love:</HI> That is, as I think for the setting forth the Commendations of his Love; for the advance of his Love in the Hearts and Minds of them that should come after. As who should say, God has had Mercy and been Gracious to you, that he might shew to others for their Encou∣ragement, that they have ground to come to him to be saved. <HI>When God saves one great Sinner, 'tis to encourage another great sinner to come to him for Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>He saved the <HI>Thief,</HI> to encourage <HI>Thieves</HI> to come to him for Mercy. He saved <HI>Magdalen,</HI> to encourage other <HI>Magdalens</HI> to come to him for Mercy. He saved <HI>Saul,</HI> to encourage <HI>Sauls</HI> to come to him for Mercy; and this <HI>Paul</HI> himself doth say, <HI>For this cause</HI> saith he <HI>I obtained Mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all long Suffering, for a Pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to Life everlasting,</HI> 1 Tim. 1.16.</P>
<P>How plain are the Words? Christ in saving of me, has given to the World a Pattern of his Grace, that they might see and believe, and come and be saved: That they that are to be born hereafter, might believe on Jesus Christ to Life everlasting.</P>
<P>But what was <HI>Paul</HI>? why he tells you himself, <HI>I am</HI> says he, <HI>the chief of Sinners; I was</HI> says he, <HI>a Blasphemer, a Persecutor, an injurious Person: Bat I obtained
<PB N="37" REF="003637_0021_10023A82992D09B0"/>
Mercy:</HI> 1 Tim. 1.14, 15. Ay, that's well for you <HI>Paul,</HI> but what Advantage have we thereby? Oh very much saith he; <HI>For for this cause I obtained Mercy</HI> that in me <HI>First,</HI> Jesus Christ might shew all long suffering for a pattern to them which shall believe on him to Life everlasting.</P>
<P>Thus there you see this third Reason is of Strength, namely, That Jesus Christ would have Mercy offered in the <HI>first place</HI> to the biggest Sinners, <HI>because, by their Forgiveness and Salvation, others hearing of it, will be encouraged the more to come to him for Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>It may well therefore be said to God, Thou delightest in Mercy, and Mercy pleases thee, <HI>Mich.</HI> 7.18.</P>
<P>But who believes that this was God's Design in shewing Mercy of old? Namely, That we that come after, might take Courage to come to him for Mercy; or that Jesus Christ would have Mercy offer∣ed in the first place to the biggest Sinner, to stir up others to come to him for Life. This is not the manner of Men! O God. But <HI>David</HI> saw this betimes, therefore he makes this one Argument with God, That he would blot out his Trangressions, that he would forgive his Adultery, his Mur∣der and horrible Hypocrisy. <HI>Do it, O Lord,</HI> saith he do it, And <HI>then will I teach Transgressors thy ways, and Sinners shall
<PB N="38" REF="003637_0022_10023A78D7C651A8"/>
be converted unto thee</HI> Psal. 15.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</P>
<P>He knew that the Conversion of Sinners would be a work highly pleasing to God, as being that which he had designed before he made Mountains or Hills: Wherefore he comes, and he saith Save me, O Lord; if thou wilt save me I will fall in with thy Design, I will help to bring what Sinners to thee I can And Lord, I am willing to be made a Preacher my self, for that I have been a horrible Sinner, wherefore if thou wilt forgive My great Trangressions, I shall be a fit Man to tell of thy wondrous Grace, to others: Yea, Lord, I dare pro∣mise, that if thou wilt have Mercy upon me, it shall tend to the Glory of thy Grace, and also to the encrease of thy Kingdom, for I will tell it; and Sinners will heat on't. And there is nothing so suiteth with the hearing, Sinner, as Mercy, and to be inform'd that God is willing to bestow it upon him. I <HI>will teach Transgressors thy way, &amp; Sinners shall be converted unto thee.</HI></P>
<P>Nor will Christ Jesus miss of his Design it profering of Mercy in the <HI>first place</HI> to the biggest Sinners. You know what work the Lord by laying hold of the Wo∣man of <HI>Samaria,</HI> made among the People there: They knew that she was a Town-Sinner, an Adulteress, Yea, one that after the most audacious manner lived in Un∣cleanness
<PB N="39" REF="003637_0022_10023A78D7C651A8"/>
with a Man that was not her Husband. But when she from a turn up∣on her Heart, went into the City and said to her Neighbours, Come: Oh how, how they came, how they flocked out of the City to Jesus Christ! <HI>Then they went out of the City, and came to him, and many of the Samaritans,</HI> (People per∣haps as bad as her self) <HI>believed on him, for the saying of the Woman, which testi∣fied, saying, He told we all that ever I did,</HI> (John 4.39.)</P>
<P>That word, <HI>He told me all that ever I did,</HI> was a great Argument with them; for by that they gathered, That that tho' he knew her to be vile, yet he did not Despise her, nor refuse to shew how wil∣ling he was to communicate his Grace unto her: And this fetched over, first her, then them:</P>
<P>This Woman, as I said, was a <HI>Samaritan-sinner,</HI> a Sinner of the worst Complexion: For the <HI>Jews</HI> abhorred to have ought to do with them <HI>(verse</HI> 9.) wherefore none more fit than she to be made one of the <HI>Decoys</HI> of Heaven, to bring others of these <HI>Samaritan Wild-fowls</HI> under the Net of the Grace of Christ; and she did the work to purpose, and many more of the <HI>Sa∣maritans</HI> believed on him, <HI>Verse</HI> 40, 41, 42. The Heart of Man, tho' set on Sin, when it comes to a Perswasion that
<PB N="40" REF="003637_0023_10023A8CDBFE4A50"/>
God is willing to have Mercy upon us, incl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nes to come to Jesus Christ for Life; witness these turn-aways from God, that you also read in <HI>Jeremiah</HI>; for after they heard three or four times over, that God had Mercy for Back-sliders, they broke out and said, <HI>Behold we come unto thee for thou art the Lord our God.</HI> Or as those in <HI>Hosea,</HI> For <HI>in the Fatherless find Mercy,</HI> Jer. 3.22. Hos. 14.1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>Mercy and the revelation thereof is the only Antidote against Sin. 'Tis of a thaw∣ing Nature, twill loose the Heart that is frozen up in Sin, yea, 'twill make the Un∣willing to come to Jesus Christ for Life.</P>
<P><HI>Wherefore do you think was it that Je∣sus Christ told the Adulterous Woman, and that before so many Sinners,</HI> that he had not condemned her, <HI>but to allure her with them there present, to hope to find Favour at his Hand? (As he also saith in ano∣ther place:</HI> I came not to judges, but to save the World) <HI>for might they not thence most rationally conclude that if Jesus Christ had rather, save then damn an Harlot, there was encouragement for them to come to him for Mercy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I heard once a Story from a Souldier, who with his Company had laid Siege a∣gainst a Fort, that so long as the Besieged were perswaded their Foes would shew them no Favour, they fought like Mad men; but
<PB N="41" REF="003637_0023_10023A8CDBFE4A50"/>
when they saw one of their Fellows taken, and received to Favour, they all came tumbling down from their Fortress: And delivered themselves into their Enemies Hands.</HI></P>
<P>I am perswaded, did Men believe that there is that Grace &amp; Willingness in the Heart of Christ to save Sinners, as the Word imports there is, they would come tumbling into his Arms: But Satan has blinded their Minds, they cannot see this thing, How∣beit the Lord Jesus has, as I said, that o∣thers take Heart and come to him, given out a Commandment that Mercy should in the first place be offered to the biggest Sinners. <HI>Begin</HI> saith he, <HI>at Jerusalem.</HI> And thus I end the third Reason.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Jesus Christ would have Mer∣cy offered in the <HI>first place</HI> to the biggest Sinners, <HI>Because that is the way if they receive it, most to weaken the Kingdom of Satan, and to keep it lowest in every Age of the World</HI>: The biggest Sinners they are Satan's <HI>Colonels,</HI> and <HI>Captains,</HI> the Leaders of his People, and they that most stoutly make head against the Son of God. Where∣fore let these first be conquered, and his Kingdom will be weak. When <HI>Ishbosheth</HI> had lost his <HI>Abner,</HI> his Kingdom was made weak, nor did he sit but <HI>tottering then upon his Throne</HI>; So when Satan loseth his strong Men, them that are mighty
<PB N="42" REF="003637_0024_10023A76730E5BB8"/>
to work Iniquity, and <HI>dexterous</HI> to manage others in the same, then is his Kingdom weak. (2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 3.) Therefore I say, Christ doth offer Mercy, in the first place to such, the more to weaken his Kingdom. Christ Jesus was glad to see Satan fall like Light∣ning from Heaven, that is, suddenly or headlong; and it was surely, by casting of him out of strong Possessions, and by reco∣vering of some notorious Sinners out of his Clutches, <HI>(Luke</HI> 1.17, 18, 19.)</P>
<P><HI>Sampson,</HI> when he would pull down the <HI>Philistians</HI> Temple, took hold of the two main Pillars of it, and breaking them, down came the House. Christ came to destroy the works of the Devil, and to destroy by converting Grace, as well as by redeeming Blood. Now Sin swarms, and lieth by Legions and whole Armies, in the Souls of the biggest Sinners, as in Garrisons: Wherefore the way, the most direct way to destroy it is first to deal with such Sin∣ners, by the Word of his Gospel, and by the Merits of his Passion.</P>
<P>For Example, tho' I shall give you but a homely one, Suppose a Family to be very Lousie, and one or two of the Family to be in chief the Breeders, the way, the quickest way to clear that Family, or at least to weaken the so swarming of those Vermin, is in the <HI>first place</HI> to sweeten the Skin, Head, and Cloathes of <HI>chief Breed∣ers.</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="003637_0024_10023A76730E5BB8"/>
And then, tho' all the Family should be apt to breed them, the Number of them and so the greatness of that Plague there will be the more impaired.</P>
<P><HI>Why there are some People that are in chief the</HI> Devils Sin-breeders <HI>in the Towns and places where they live; the Place Town or Family where they live must needs be horrible Lousie, and as it were eaten up with</HI> Vermin; <HI>now let the Lord Jesus in the first place cleanse these great Breeders, and there will be given a Nip to those swarms of Sins that use to be committed in such places thro' out the Town, House, or Family where such</HI> Sin-breeding <HI>Persons use to be.</HI></P>
<P>I speak by Experience, I was one of those Lousy ones; one of these great <HI>Sin-breeders</HI>; I infected all the Youth of the Town, where I was born with all manner of youthful Vanities. The Neighbours counted me so, my practise proved me so; Wherefore Christ Jesus took me first, and taking me first, the Contagion was much allayed all the Town over When God made one sigh, they would hearken, and inquiringly say, <HI>What's the matter with</HI> John? They also gave their various Opi∣nions of me, but as I said, Sin cooled and failed, as, to its full Carreer; and when I went out to seek the Bread of Life, some of them would follow, and the rest be put
<PB N="44" REF="003637_0025_10023A3F351A48B8"/>
into a muse at home. Yea, almost the Town. At first, at times I would go out to hear at the place where I found good: Yea, young and old for a while had some Reformation on them; also some of them perceiving that God had Mercy upon me, came crying to him for Mercy too.</P>
<P>But what need I give you an Instance of poor I? I will come to <HI>Manasseh</HI> the King: So long as he was a ring leading Sinner, the great Idolater, aad chief for Devilism, the whole Land flowed with Wickedness; <HI>for he made them to sin,</HI> and do worse than the Heathen that dwelt round about them, or that was cast out from before them. But when God con∣verted him, the whole Land was reformed▪ Down went the Groves, the Idols and Alters of <HI>Baal,</HI> and up went true Religi∣on in much of the Power and Purity of it. You'll say, The King reformed by Power. I answer doubtless, and by Ex∣ample too; For People observe their Lea∣ders as their Fathers did, so did they, 2 <HI>Chron</HI> 33. 2 Kings 12.41.</P>
<P>This therefore is another Reason, why <HI>Jesus</HI> would have Mercy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners, because that is the best way, if they receive it, most to weaken the Kingdom of Satan and to keep it poor and low.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="003637_0025_10023A3F351A48B8"/>And do you not think now, that if God would but take hold of the Hearts of some of the most notorious in your Town, in your Family, or Country, that this thing would be verified before your Faces? It would, it would, to the Joy of you that are godly, to the making of Hell to sigh, to the great suppressing of Sin, the Glory of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the Joy of the Angels of God. And Ministers should therefore, that this work might go on, take Advantages to perswade with the biggest Sinners to come unto <HI>Christ</HI> according to my Text, and their Commissions: <HI>Beginning at Jerusalem</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Jesus Christ would have Mercy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners. Because such when converted, are usually the best Helps in the Church against Temptations, and fittest for the Support of the feeble minded there. Hence usually you have some such in the first Plantation of Churches; or quickly upon it. Churches would do but sorrily if Christ Jesus did not put such Converts among them, they are the Monuments and Mir∣rors of Mercy. The very sight of such a Sinner in God's House, yea, the very thought of him, where the sight of him cannot be had, is oft-times greatly for the help of the Faith of the Feeble.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="003637_0026_10023A2CB6201058"/><HI>When the Churches</HI> (saith Paul) <HI>that were in Judea, heard this concerning me, that he which persecuted them in time past now preached the Faith which once he destroyed, They glorified God in me,</HI> Gal. 1.20 <HI>to</HI> 24.</P>
<P>(<HI>Glorified God</HI>) How is that? Why they praised him, and took Courage to believe the more in the Mercy of God, for that he had Mercy on such a great Sinner as he, they glorified God (in me) They wondered that Grace should be so rich, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to take hold of such a Wretch as I was; and for my sake believed in <HI>Christ</HI> the more.</P>
<P>There are two things that great Sinners are acquainted with, when they come to divulge to the Saints, that are a great re∣lief to their Faith.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Contests that they usually have with the Devil at their parting with him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Their Knowledge of his Secrets in his Workings.</P>
<P>For the <HI>first,</HI> the biggest Sinners have usually great contest with the Devil at their parting; and this is an help to Satan: For ordinary Saints find afterwards what the vile ones find at first; but when at the opening of Hearts, the one finds himself to be as the other the one is a Comfort to the other. The lesser fort of Sinners find but little of this, till after they have been
<PB N="47" REF="003637_0026_10023A2CB6201058"/>
some time in profession; but the vile Man meets with his at the Beginning. Where∣fore he, when the other is down, is ready to tell that he has met with the same be∣fore. For I say he has had it before. Satan is loath to part with a great Sinner: What my true Servant (quoth he) my old Servant wilt thou forsake me now? Having so often sold thy self to me to work Wickedness, wilt thou forsake me now? Thou horrible Wretch doth not know, that thou hast sinned thy self beyond the reach of Grace, and dost think to find Mercy now? Art not thou a Murderer, a Thief, a Harlot, a Witch, a Sinner of the greatest size, and dost thou look for Mercy now? Dost thou think that <HI>Christ</HI> will foul his Fingers with thee?</P>
<P>'Tis enough to make Angels blush, <HI>saith Satan,</HI> to see so vile a one knock at Heavens Gates for Mercy, and wilt thou be so abominably bold to do it? Thus Sa∣tan dealt with me, says the great Sinner? when at first I came to <HI>Jesus Christ. And what did you reply saith the Tempted?</HI> Why I granted the whole Charge to be true, says the other. <HI>And what did you dispair? or how</HI>? No (saith he) I said, I am <HI>Magdalen,</HI> I am <HI>Zacheus,</HI> I am the <HI>Thief,</HI> I am the <HI>Harlot,</HI> I am the <HI>Publi∣can,</HI> I am the <HI>Prodigal,</HI> and one of <HI>Christ's</HI> Murderers, yea, worse than any
<PB N="48" REF="003637_0027_10023A91A0D84F58"/>
of these: And yet God was so far off from rejecting of me (as I found afterwards) that there was musick and dancing in his House for me, for Joy that I was come home unto him. <HI>Oh blessed be God for grace,</HI> (says the other) <HI>for then I hope there is savour for me.</HI> Yea, as I told you, such a one is a continual Spectacle in the Church, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or every one by to behold God's Grace, and Wonder!</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> And as for the secrets of Satan, such as Suggestions to question the Being of God, the Truth of his Word, and to be annoyed with devilish Blasphemies: None more acquainted with these than the biggest Sinners at their Conversion; where∣fore thus also they are prepared to be helps in the Church, to relieve and comfort the other.</P>
<P>I might also here tell you of the Con∣tests and Battles that such are engaged in, wherein they find the Buffetings of Satan, above any other of the Saints. At which time Satan Assaults the Soul with Dark∣ness▪ Fears, frightful Thoughts of Appa∣ritions; now they sweat, pant, cry out, and struggle for Life.</P>
<P>The Angels now come down to behold the sight, and rejoice to see a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of Dust and Ashes to overcome Principalities and Powers, and Dominions. But as I said, when these come a little to be settled,
<PB N="49" REF="003637_0027_10023A91A0D84F58"/>
they are prepared for Help for others, and are great Comforts unto them. Their great Sins give encouragement to the Devil to assault them, and by these Temp∣tations <HI>Christ</HI> takes Advantage to make them the more helpful to the Churches.</P>
<P>The biggest Sinner, when he is Con∣verted and come into the Church, says to them all, by his very coming in, <HI>Behold me, all you that are Men and Women of a low and timerous Spirit; you whose hearts are narrow, for that you never had the advantage to know (because your Sins are few) the largeness of God. Behold I say, in me the exceeding Riches of his Grace; I am a pattern set forth before your Faces, on whom you may look and take Heart.</HI> This I say, the great Sinner can say, to the exceeding Comfort of all the rest.</P>
<P>Wherefore as I have hinted before, when God intends to stock a place with Saints, and to make that Place excellently to flourish with the Riches of his Grace, he usually begins with the Conversition of some of the most notorious thereabouts, and lays them as an Example to allure others, and to build them up when they are converted.</P>
<P>'Twas <HI>Paul</HI> that must go to the <HI>Gen∣tiles,</HI> because <HI>Paul</HI> was the most outragi∣ous of all the Apostles in the time of his
<PB N="50" REF="003637_0028_10023A30B638C878"/>
Unregeneration: Yea, <HI>Peter</HI> must be he that after his horrible fall, was thought fittest when recovered ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to comfort and strengthen his Brethren. See <HI>Luke</HI> 22.31, 32.</P>
<P>Some must be Pillars in Gods House; and if they be Pillars of Cedar, they must stand whilst they are stout and sturdy Sticks in the Forrest, before they are cut down, and planted or placed there.</P>
<P>No Man when he buildeth his House, makes the principal parts thereof, of weak and feeble Timber: (For how could such bear up the rest?) but of great and able Wood. <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> also goeth this way to work, he makes of the biggest Sinners, Bearers and Supporters to the Rest. This then may serve for another Reason, why <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> gives out in Commandment, that Mercy should in the first place be offered to the biggest sinners, because such when converted, are usually the best help in Churches against Temptation, and fittest for the support of the feeble minded there.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Another Reason, why <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> would have Mercy offered in the <HI>first place</HI> to the biggest Sinners is, Because they when converted▪ are apt to love him most.</P>
<P>This agrees both with the Scripture and Reason. Scripture says so. <HI>To whom
<PB N="51" REF="003637_0028_10023A30B638C878"/>
much is forgiven, the same loveth much; to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little,</HI> Luke 7.47. Reason says so. For as it would be the Unreasonablest thing in the World, to render Hatred for Love, and Contempt for Forgiveness; so it would be Ridiculous to think that reception of a little kindness, should lay the same obli∣gations upon the Heart to love, as the re∣ception of a great deal. I would not dis∣parage the Love of <HI>Christ</HI>; I know the least dram of it, when it reaches to <HI>For∣giveness</HI> is great above all the World; but comparatively, there is greater extentions of the Love of <HI>Christ</HI> to one, than to ano∣ther: He that has most Sin, if forgiven, is partaker of the greatest Love, of the greatest Forgiveness.</P>
<P>I know also that there is some, that from this very Doctrine, say, <HI>Let us do Evil that Good may come,</HI> and that turn the Grace of our God into Laciviousness. But! speak not to these: These will nei∣ther be ruled by Grace nor Reason; Grace would Teach them, if they knew it, to deny Ungodly Courses; and so would Reason to; if it could truly sense the Love of God, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.13, 14. <HI>Rom</HI> 11.2.</P>
<P>Doth it look like what hath any Con∣sistence with Reason or Mercy, for a Man to abuse his Friend? Because <HI>Christ</HI> died for Men I shall therefore spit in his Face?

The Bread and Water that was given by <HI>Eilsha</HI> to his Enemies, that came into the Land of <HI>Israel</HI> to take him, had so much influence upon their minds, tho <HI>Heathens</HI> that they return'd to their homes without hurting him: Yea, it kept them from coming again, for a long time into the Coasts of <HI>Israel</HI> 2 Kings 6.19 <HI>to</HI> 23.</P>
<P>But to forbear to Illustrate till anon▪ One Reason why <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> shews Mer∣cy to Sinners is, that he might obtain thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Love, that he may remove their base Af∣fections, from base Objects, to himself▪ Now if he loves to be loved little, he loves to be loved much; but there is not any that are capable of loving much, save those that have much forgiven them; hence 'tis said of <HI>Paul,</HI> that he laboured more than them all, to wit, with a Labour of Love, because he had been by Sin more vile a∣gainst <HI>Christ,</HI> than they all, 1 <HI>cor.</HI> 15.

<P>This raving Bedlam, that once was so, is he that now says. <HI>I laboured more than them all; more for</HI> Christ <HI>than them all.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But</HI> Paul, <HI>what moved thee thus to do</HI>? The Love of Christ, says he. It was not I

but the Grace of God that was with me. As who should say; <HI>O Grace</HI>! 'Twas such Grace to save me! 'Twas such Marvelous Grace for God to look down from Hea∣ven upon me, and that secured me from the wrath to come, that I am captivated with the sense of the Riches of it. Hence I act, hence I labour; for how can I o∣therwise do, since God not only separated me from my Sins and Companions, but separated all the Powers of my Soul &amp; Bo∣dy to his Service? I am therefore prompted on by this exceeding Love to labour as I have done; <HI>yet not I, but the Grace of God with me.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! I shall never forget his Love, not the Circumstance under which I was, when his Love laid hold upon me, I was going to <HI>Damascus</HI> with Letters from the High Priest to make Havock of God's People there, as I had made Havock of them in other places. These bloody Letters were not imposed upon me. I went to the High Priest and desired them of him, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.1, 2. And yet he saved me! I was one of the chief Men, that had a hand in the Blood of his Martyr <HI>Stephen,</HI> yet he had Mercy on me; When I was at <HI>Da∣mascus,</HI> I stunk so horribly like a Blood∣sucker, that I became a Terror to all thereabout. Yea, <HI>Annanias</HI> (good Man) made intercession to my Lord against me,
<PB N="54" REF="003637_0030_10023A6C0C31B058"/>
yet he would have Mercy upon me? Yea, joyned Mercy to Mercy, until he had made me a Monument of Grace. He made a Saint of me, and perswaded me that my Transgressions were forgiven me.</P>
<P>When I began to Preach those that heard me were amazed; and said, <HI>Is not this he that destroyed them that called on this Name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound to the High Prie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI>? Hell doth know that I was a Sinner: The World also knows that I was a Sinner; a Sinner of the greatest size; but I obtained Mercy, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.21, 22.</P>
<P>Shall not this lay an Obligation upon me? Is it not Love of the greatest force to oblige? Is it not strong as Death: cruel as the Grave, and hotter than the Coals of <HI>Juniper</HI>? Hath it not a most vehement flame? Can the Waters quench it? Can the Floods drown it? I am under the force of it, and this is my continual cry; <HI>What shall I render unto the Lord for all th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Benefits which he has bestowed upon me</HI>? Ay! <HI>Paul,</HI> this is something thou speak∣est like a Man, like a Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ and carried away with the Love and Grace of God. Now this sense, and this affection▪ and this Labour, giveth to <HI>Christ</HI> the love that he looks for. But he might have converted twenty little Sinners, and yet

<P>I wonder how far a Man might go a∣mong the Converted Sinners of the small∣er size, before he could find one that so much as looks any thing this way ward. Where is he that is thus under Pangs of of Love for the Grace bestowed upon him by <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>? Excepting only some few▪ you may walk to the Worlds end, and find none: But as I said; some there are, and so there has been in every Age of the Church, great Sinners, that have had much forgiven them. And they love much upon this account.</P>
<P><HI>Jesus Christ</HI> therefore knows what he doth, when he lays hold on the Hearts of sinners of the biggest size. He knows that such an one will love more than ma∣ny, that have not sinned half their sins.</P>
<P>I will tell you a story that I have read of <HI>Martha</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI>; the name of the Book I have forgot, I mean of the book in which I found the Relation; but the Thing was thus.</P>
<P><HI>Martha</HI> saith my Author was a very holy Woman, like <HI>Lazarus</HI> her Bro∣ther, but <HI>Mary</HI> was a loose &amp; wanton Creature. <HI>Martha</HI> did seldom miss good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermons, and Lectures, when she could come at them in <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; but <HI>Mary</HI> would frequent the House of Sports, and

the Company of the Vilest of Men for lust. And tho' <HI>Martha</HI> had often desired that her Sister would go with her to hear her Preachers; yea, had often entreated her with Tears to do it, yet could she never prevail; for still <HI>Mary</HI> would make her excuse, or reject her with disdain, for her Zeal and Preciseness in Religion.</P>
<P>After <HI>Martha</HI> had waited long, tried many ways to bring her Sister to good, and all proved ineffectual: At last, she comes upon her thus; <HI>Sister</HI> quoth she, <HI>I pray thee to go with me to the Temple to day, to hear one Preach a Sermon.</HI> What kind of Preacher is he, said she? <HI>Martha</HI> repli∣ed, <HI>It is one</HI> Jesus <HI>of</HI> Nazareth, <HI>He is the Handsomest Man that ever you saw with your Eyes; Oh! he shines in Beauty, and is a most excellent Preacher.</HI></P>
<P>Now wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> does <HI>Mary</HI> do, after a little pause, but goes up into her Chamber, and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h her Pins and her Clou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s decks up her self as fine as her fingers could make her: This done away she goes; not wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h her Sister <HI>Martha,</HI> but as much unobser∣ved as she could to the <HI>Sermon,</HI> or rather to see the Preacher?</P>

Book, yet I have as far as my Memory will admit, given you the Relation of the matter. However, <HI>Luke</HI> as you see, doth here present you with the Substance of the whole.</P>
<P>Alas! <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> has but little Thanks for the saving of little Sinners. <HI>To whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.</HI> He gets no Water for his Feet by his saving of dry eyed Christians in the World, and a∣bundance of dry eyed Duties too; Duties that never were weted with the Tears of contrition and repentance, nor ever sweet∣ned with the great sinners Box of Oint∣ment. And the Reason is, such Sinners have no great Sins to be saved from; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if they have, they look upon them in the <HI>diminishing Glass</HI> of the holy Law of God. But I rather believe that the Professors of our Days weep a due sense of what they are; for verily, for the generality of them, both before and since Conversion, they have been sinners of a lusty size: But i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Eyes be holden, if Convictions ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not shown, if the knowledge of their sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is but like to the Eye-sight in twilight, the Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cannot be affected with that Grace that has laid hold on the Man, and so <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> sows much, and has little coming in.</P>
<P>Wherefore his way is oft-times to step out of the way to <HI>Jericho,</HI> to <HI>Samaria,</HI> to
<PB N="61" REF="003637_0033_10023A4A49BFAAA0"/>
the Country of the <HI>Gaddarens,</HI> to the Coasts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon,</HI> and also Mount <HI>Calvery,</HI> that he may lay hold of such kind of <HI>Sinners</HI> as will love him to liking, <HI>Luke</HI> 19.1, <HI>to</HI> 10. <HI>John</HI> 4.3, <HI>to</HI> 10. <HI>Mark</HI> 5.1, <HI>to</HI> 20. <HI>Matth.</HI> 15.21, <HI>to</HI> 28. <HI>Luke</HI> 23.33, <HI>to</HI> 43.</P>
<P>But thus much for the Sixth Reason, why <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> would have Mercy offer'd in the first place to the biggest Sinners, to wit, because such sinners when converted, are apt to love him most.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jerusalem sinners,</HI> were they that out-strip'd when they were conver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in some things, all the Churches of the <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI>: They were of one Heart &amp; one Soul, neither said any of them that ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the things that they possessed was their own▪ neither was there any among them that lacked; for as many as were possessors of Lands or Houses, sold them, and brought the Price of the things that were sold, and laid them down at the Apostles feet, &amp;c. Acts 4 32 <HI>to</HI> 35. Now show me such ano∣ther Pattern if you can. But why did these do thus? Oh they were <HI>Jerusalem-sinners.</HI> These were the Men that but a little be∣fore had killed the Prince of Life; and those to whom he did, that notwithstand∣ing sent the first offer of Grace and Mercy, and the sense of this took them up betwixt Earth and the Heaven, and, carried them
<PB N="62" REF="003637_0034_10023A5374C17288"/>
on in such Methods as could never be troden by any since. They talk of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and set her in her Primitive State as a Pattern, and Mother of Churches; when the Truth is, they were the <HI>Jerusa∣lem-Sinners,</HI> when Converts, that out-did all Churches that ever was.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> Christ Jesus would have Mer∣cy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners, because Grace when it is received by such, finds matter to kindle upon more freely such, it finds in other Sinners. Great Sinners are like great Candles, which burns best, and shines with biggest Light? I lay not this down, as I did those Reasons before, to shew that when great Sinners are converted, they will be Encouragement to others, tho' that is true; but to shew that <HI>Christ</HI> has a delight to see the Grace we receive, to shine. We love to see things that bear a Gloss, yea we chuse to buy such kind of Matter to work upon, as will if wrought up to what we intend, cast that Lustre that we desire. Candles that burn not bright, we like not; Wood that is green will rather smother and sputter, and flounce, then cast a brave light and plea∣sant Heat. Wherefore great Folks care not much, not so much for such kind of things, as for them that will better answer their ends.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="003637_0034_10023A5374C17288"/>Hence <HI>Christ</HI> desires the biggest Sinners, in them there is Matter to work by, to wit, a great deal of Sin; for as by the Tallow of the Candle, the Fire takes occasion to burn the brighter; so by the Sin of the Soul, Grace takes occasion to shine the clearer. Little Candles shine but little, for there wanteth matter for the Fire to work upon; but in the great Sinner, here is more matter for Grace to work by. Faith shines, when it worketh towards <HI>Christ,</HI> thro' the sides of many and great Transgressors; and so does Love, for that much is forgiven and what matter can be found in the Soul for Humility to work by, so well as by a sight, that I have been and am an abominable Sinner? And the same is to be said of Patience, Meekness, Gentleness and self-denial, or of any other Grace. Grace takes Occasion by the vile∣ness of the Man to shine the more; even as by the ruggedness of a very strong Dis∣temper, or Disease, the vertue of the Me∣dicine is the best made manifest. <HI>Where Sin abounds, Grace much more abounds,</HI> Rom. 5 20. A black string makes the Neck look whiter; great Sins make Grace burn clear. Some say when Grace and good Nature meet together, they do make shining Christians; but I say, when Grace and a great Sinner meets, and when Grace subdue that great Sinner to it self, and shall
<PB N="64" REF="003637_0035_1002021D19FF6928"/>

<P>I have often marvelled at your Youth, and said in my Heart what should be the Reason that they should be so generally at this Day debauched as they are! For they are now prophane to Amazement, and sometimes I have thought one thing and sometimes another: That is, why God should suffer it to be so. And at last I have thought of this: How if the God whose ways are past finding out, should suffer it to be so now, that he might make some of them the more glorious Saints hereafter. I know Sin is of the Devil, but it cannot work in the World without per∣mission: And if it happens to be as I have thought, it will not be the first time that God the Lord has caught Satan in his own Design. For my part I believe that the time is at Hand, that we shall see better Saints in the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld, than has been seen in it this many a Day. And this Vileness which does at present so much swallow up our Youth, is one cause of my thinking so.

<P>Just before <HI>Christ</HI> came into the Flesh, the World was degenerared as it is now; the Generality of the Men in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> were become either high and famous for Hypocrisie, or filthy base in their Lives. The Devil also was broke loose in a hid∣eous manner, and had taken Possession of many: Yea, I believe that there was never a Generation before nor since, that could produce so many possessed with Devils, Deformed, Lame, Blind, and infected with monstrous Diseases, as that Generation could: But what was the Reason thereof? I mean the Reason from God?

<P>Now if these Devils and Diseases, as they possessed Men then, were to make way and work for an approaching <HI>Christ</HI> in Per∣son; and for the declaring of his Power; why may we not think that now, even now also he is ready to come by his Spirit in the Gospel, to heal many of the De∣baucheries of our Age; I cannot believe that Grace will take them all; for there is but few that are saved. But it will take some, even some of the worst of Men, and make blessed ones of them. But O, how these Ring leaders in Vice, will then shine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Vertue!

<P>I know there is ground to fear that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>niquity of this Generation will be pursued with heavy Judgments; but that will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inder what we have supposed, that God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook him a glorious Church out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loody <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; yea out of the chief of

the Tree; admiring that ever it should come into their Hearts, once to think of coming to God by Christ: But above all, blessing God for granting of them light to see those Incouragements, in his Testament; without which, without Doubt they had been daunted, and sunk down under the guilt of Sin and Despair, as their Fellow Sinners have done.</P>
<P>But now they are all witnesses for God and for his Grace, against an unbelieving World; for as I said, they shall come to <HI>convince</HI> the World of their Speeches, their hard and unbelieving Words, that they have spoken concerning the Mercy of God and the Merits of the Passion of his blessed Son, <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>

<P>For what will sting like this, I have thro' mine own foolish, narrow, unworthy, under-valuing Thoughts of the Love and Ability of Christ to save me, brought my self to everlasting Ruin; 'tis true, I was a horrible Sinner, not one in a Hundred did live so vile a Life as I, but this should not have kept me from closing with. <HI>Jesus

Christ</HI>: I see now that there are abundance in Glory that once was as bad as I have been, but they were saved by Faith, and I am damned by Unbelief.</P>
<P>Wretch that I am! why did not I give Glory to the redeeming Blood of <HI>Jesu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>? Why did I judge of his Ability to save me by the Line of my shallow Reason, and the Voice of a Guilty Conscience? Why betook not I my self to the holy Word of God? Why did not I read and pray, that I might understand, since now I per∣ceive that God said then, <HI>He giveth lib∣erally to them that pray, and upbraideth not,</HI> Jam. 1.5.</P>
<P>'Tis rational to think that by such Co∣gitations as these, the unbelieving World will be torn to pieces before the Judgment of <HI>Christ</HI>: Especially those that have lived where they did or might have heard the Gospel of the Grace of God. Oh that saying, <HI>It shall be more tolerable for</HI> Sodom <HI>at the Judgment than for them,</HI> will be better understood; see <HI>Luke</HI> 10.8, to 12.</P>
<P>This Reason therefore standeth fast, namely, That Christ, by offering Mercy in the <HI>first place</HI> to the biggest Sinners now, <HI>will stop all Mouths of the Impenitent at the Day of Judgment,</HI> and cut off all Excuse that shall be attempted to be made (from the thoughts of the greatness of their Sins) why they came not to him.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="003637_0040_10023A5A6A27A428"/>I have often thought of the Day of Judgment, and how God will deal with sinners at that Day; and I believe it will be managed with that Sweetness, with that Eq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>bleness, with that excellent Righte∣ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ss, as to every Sin, and Circumstance, and Aggravation thereof, that men that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e damned, before the Judgment is over, shall receive such Conviction of the righteous Judgment of God upon them, and their Deserts of Hell fire, that they shall in themselves conclude, that there is all the Reason in the World that they should be shut out of Heaven and go into Hell fire: <HI>Those shall go away into ever∣lasting Fire,</HI> Mat. 25.46.</P>
<P>Only this will tear, that they have miss'd of Mercy and Glory, and obtain'd everlast∣ing Damnation thro' their Unbelief.

<P>And thus much for the Reasons. I will c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nclude with a Word or two by way of Application.</P>

<HEAD>The APLICATION.</HEAD>

There are in the World as one may call them, the mo∣derate Sinners; the Sinners that mix Righ∣teousness with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Pollutions; the Sin∣ners, that tho' they be Sinners, do what on their part lies, (some that are blind would think so) that they might be saved.
<PB N="77" REF="003637_0041_10023A36AF98D850"/>
I say, it had been Love, great Love, if he had died for none but such, and sent his Love to such: But that he should send out <HI>conditions of Peace</HI> to the biggest Sinners! yea, that they should be offered to them first of all! (for so he means when he says <HI>Begin at Jerusalem)</HI> This is wonderful, this shows his Heart to purpose, as also the heart of God his Father who sent him to do thus.</P>
<P>There is nothing more incident to Men that are awake in their Souls, than to have wrong Thoughts of God: Thoughts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat are narrow, and that pinch and pen up his Mercy to scanty and beggerly conclusions, and ridged legal Conditions; supposing that it is rude and intrenching upon his Majesty to come ourselves, or to invite o∣thers, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il we have scraped, and washed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd rubbed off so much of our Dirt from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, as we think is convenient; to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s somewhat orderly and handsome in his sight.

he so willing to save, as some pretended Gospellers imagine: But I ask such if the Father and Son be not unspeakably free to shew Mercy, why was this Clause put into our Commission to preach the Gospel? Yea, why did he say, <HI>Begin at Jerusalem</HI>? For when Men thro' the weekness of their Wits, have attempted to shew other Rea∣sons why they should have the first Profer of Mercy, yet I can prove (by many un∣deniable Reasons) that they of <HI>Jerusa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em</HI> (to whom the Apostles made first offer, according as they were commanded) were the biggest Sinners that ever brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h'd up∣on the Face of the Earth (se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the un∣pardonable Sin aside) upon which my Doctrine stands like a Rock, That <HI>Jesus</HI> the Son of God would have Mercy in the first place offered to the biggest Sinners: And if this doth not shew the Heart of the Father and the Son to be infinitely free in bestowing forgiveness of Sins, I confess my self mistaken.</P>
<P>Neither is there, set this aside, another Argument like it, to shew us the Wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing∣ness of <HI>Christ</HI> to save Sinners: For, as was said before, all the rest of the signs of Christ's Mercifulness might have been li∣mited to Sinners that are so, and so quali∣fied; but when he says; <HI>Begin at Jeru∣salem,</HI> the Line is stretched out to the ut∣most, no Man can imagine beyond <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and
<PB N="79" REF="003637_0042_10023A4CE2556208"/>
it is a Folly here to pinch and pare, to nar∣row and seek to bring it within scanty Bounds, for he plainly saith, <HI>Begin at Je∣rusalem.</HI> The biggest Sinner is the <HI>Jeru∣salem Sinner.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, he saith that <HI>Repentance and Remission of Sins must go together,</HI> but yet Remission is sent to the chief the <HI>Jerusa∣salem sinner,</HI> nor doth Repentance lessen at all the <HI>Jerusalem sinner's crimes</HI>; it di∣minisheth none of his Sins, nor causes that there should be hall a one the fewer. It only puts a stop to the <HI>Jerusalem sinner's</HI> course, and makes him willing to be sa∣ved freely by Grace, and for time to come to be govern'd by that blessed Word that has brought the <HI>Tidings of good things</HI> to him.</P>
<P>Besides no Man shews himself willing to be saved that repenteth not of his Deeds, for he that goes on still in his Trespasses, declares that he is resolv'd to pursue his own Damnation further.</P>
<P>Learn then to judge of the largeness of God's Heart, and the Heart of his Son Jesus Christ, by the Word, judge not there∣of by feeling, nor by the Reports of thy Conscience; Conscience is oftentimes here befooled, and made to go quite besides the Word: 'Twas judging without the Word that made <HI>David</HI> say, I am cast off from God's Eyes, and shall perish one Day by

<P>The Word had told him another thing, namely, <HI>that he should be King in his stead.</HI> Our Text says also, <HI>that Jesus Christ bids Preachers, in their preaching Repentance and Remission of sins, begin first at</HI> Jerusa∣lem: <HI>Thereby declaring most truly the in∣finite largeness of the merciful Heart of God and his Son, to the sinful Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P>Judge thou, I say, therefore of the Good∣ness of the Heart of God and his Son, by this Text and by others of the same im∣port; so shalt thou not dishonour the Grace of God, nor needlesly fright thy self, nor give away thy Faith, nor gratifie the Devil, nor lose the Benefit of his Word; I speak now to weak Believers.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Would <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> have Mer∣cy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners, to the <HI>Jerusalem-sinners</HI>? That by this also, you must learn to judge of the sufficiency of the Merits of Christ; not that the Merits of <HI>Christ</HI>; can be compre∣hended, for that they are beyond the Con∣ceptions of the whole World, being called, <HI>The Unsearchable Riches of Christ.</HI> But yet they may be apprehended to a conside∣rable Degree. Now the way so to ap∣prehend them, is to consider what offers after his Resurrection, he makes of his Grace to Sinnners; for to be sure he will
<PB N="81" REF="003637_0043_10023A4F4423A1A0"/>
not offer beyond the Virtue of his Merits; because as Grace is the cause of his Merits, so his Merits are the Bias and Bounds, upon and by which his Grace stands good, and is let out to Sinners. Doth he then com∣mand that his Mercy should be offered in the <HI>first place</HI> to the biggest <HI>Sinners</HI>? It declares that there is a sufficiency in his Blood to save the biggest Sinners. The Blood of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> cleanseth from all Sin. And again, <HI>Be it known unto you Men and Brethren, that through this Man</HI> (this Mans Merits) <HI>is preached to you the Forgiveness of Sins; and by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which they could not be justified by the Law of Moses,</HI> Acts 13.38.</P>
<P>Observe then thy Rule, to make Judg∣ment of the sufficiency of the blessed Me∣rits of thy Saviour; if he had not been able to have reconciled the biggest Sinners to his Father by his Blood, he would not have sent to them: Have sent to them in the <HI>first place</HI> the Doctrine of Remission of Sins: for Remission of Sins is thro Faith in his Blood: We are justified freely by the Grace of God, thro the Redemption that is in the Blood of <HI>Christ.</HI> Upon the square as I may call it, of the worthiness of the Blood of <HI>Christ,</HI> Grace acts and offers Forgiveness of Sin to Men, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 1.7. <HI>chap</HI> 2 13.14. <HI>Colos.</HI> 1.20, 21, 22.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="003637_0044_10023A2EE61CF540"/>Hence therefore we must gather, That the Blood of Christ is of infinite Value, for that he offereth Mercy to the biggest of Sinners: Nay further, since he offereth Mercy in the <HI>first place</HI> to the biggest Sin∣ners; considering also that this first act of his, is that which the World will take No∣tice of and expect it should be continued unto the end: Also it is a disparagement to a Man that seeks his own Glory in what he undertakes, to do that for a spurt which he cannot continue and hold out in. This is our Lord's own Argument, <HI>he began to build,</HI> saith he, <HI>but he was not able to finish,</HI> Luke. 14.28, 29, 30.</P>
<P>Should thou hear a Man say, I am resol∣ved to be kind to the Poor, and should be∣gin giving with handfuls of <HI>Guineas,</HI> you would conclude that either he is won∣derful rich, or must straighten his Hand, or will soon be at the bottom of his Riches: Why this is the case, <HI>Christ</HI> at his Resur∣rection gave it out that would be good to the World; and first sends to the biggest Sinners, with an intent to have Mercy on them. Now the biggest Sinner cannot be saved but by an abundance of Grace; tis not a little that will save great Sinners, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.17. And I say again, since the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> amounts thus high at the first, and sends to the <HI>Jerusalem sinners,</HI> that they may come at first to partake of his Mercy;
<PB N="83" REF="003637_0044_10023A2EE61CF540"/>
it follows that either he has unsearchable Riches of Grace and worth in himself, or else he must straighten his Hand; or his Grace and Merits will be spent before the World's at an end. But let it be believed, as surely as spoken, he is still as full as ever! He is not a jot the poorer, of all the For∣giveness that he has given away to great Sinners; also he is still as free as at first, for he never yet called back this Word, <HI>Begin at the Jerusalem sinners.</HI> And as I said since his Grace is extended according to the worth of his Merits, I conclude that there is the same virtue in his merits to save now, as there was at the very be∣ginning.</P>
<P>O the Riches of the Grace of <HI>Christ</HI>! Oh the Riches of the Blood of <HI>Christ</HI>!</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Would <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> have Mer∣cy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners, then here is Encouragement for you that think, for wicked Hearts and Lives, you have not your fellows in the World; yet to come to him.</P>
<P>There is a People that therefore fear, least they should be rejected of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> be∣cause of the greatness of their Sins; when∣as you see here, such are sent to by <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to come to him for Mercy; <HI>Begin at Jerusalem:</HI> Never did one thing answer another more fitly in this World, than this Text fitteth such kind of Sinners. As Face
<PB N="84" REF="003637_0045_10023A34279ED668"/>
answereth Face in a Glass, so this Text an∣swereth the Necessities of such Sinners. What can a Man say more, but that he stands in rank of the biggest Sinners? Let him stretch himself whither he can, and think of himself to the utmost, he can but con∣clude himself to be one of the biggest Sin∣ners: And what then? Why the Text mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s him in the very Face, and saith, <HI>Christ</HI> offereth Mercy to the biggest Sinners; to the very <HI>Jerusalem-sinners.</HI> What more can be objected? Nay, he doth not only offer to such his Mercy, but to them 'tis commanded to be offered in the <HI>first place, Begin at Jerusalem. Preach Repentance and Remission of sins among all Nations, Beginning at Jerusalem.</HI> Is not here In∣couragement for those that think, for wick∣ed Hearts and Lives, they have not their Fellows in the World?</P>
<P><HI>Objection.</HI> But I have a Heart as hard as a Rock.</P>

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Well thou art in the Rank of the biggest Sinners.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But I have not only a base Heart, but I have lived a debouch'd Life.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Stand thou also among those that are called the biggest Sinners. And what then? Why the Text sweeps you all, you cannot object your selves beyond the Text: It has a particular Message to the biggest Sinners, I say it sweeps you all.</P>
<P><HI>Obje<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t.</HI> But I am a Reprobate.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Now thou talkest like a Fool, and medlest with what thou understandest not: No Sin, but the Sin of final Impeni∣tence, can Prove a Man a Reprobate. An-I am sure thou hast not arrived as yet unto that. Therefore thou understand'st not what thou sayest, and makest groundless▪ Con∣clusions against thy self. Say thou art a Sinner, and I will hold with thee. Say thou art a great Sinner, and I will say so too. Yea, say thou art one of the biggest Sinners, and spare not, for the Text yet is beyond thee; is yet betwixt Hell and the, <HI>Begin at Jerusalem,</HI> has yet a smile upon thee: And thou talkest as if thou▪ wast a Reprobate, and that the greatness of the Sins do prove thee so to be, when yet they of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> were not only such, whose Sins I dare say, were such both for bigness
<PB N="86" REF="003637_0046_10023A478E60B1D0"/>
and heinousness, as thou art not capable of committing beyond them; unless now after thou hast received Conviction that the Lord <HI>Jesus</HI> is the only Saviour of the World, thou shouldst wickedly and des∣pightfully turn thy self from him, and conclude he is not to be trusted to for life, and so crucifie him for a Cheat afresh. This I must confess will bring a Man un∣der the <HI>Black Rod,</HI> and set him in danger of eternal Damnation, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6 6. <HI>Chap.</HI> 10.29. This is trampling under Foot the Son of God, and counting his Blood an unholy thing. <HI>This did they of Jerusalem,</HI> but they did it ignorantly in Unbelief, and so were yet capable of Mercy: But to do this against professed Light, and to stand to do it, puts a Man beyond the Text indeed, <HI>Acts</HI> 3.14, <HI>to</HI> 17. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.13.</P>
<P>But I say what is this to him that would fain be saved by <HI>Christ</HI>? His Sins did as to Greatness, never yet reach to the Nature of the Sins, that the Sinners intended by the Text had made themselves guilty of: He that would be saved by Christ, has an honourable esteem of him? but they of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> preferred a murderer before him; but as for him they cried, away, away with him, 'tis not fit that he should live. Per∣haps thou wilt object, <HI>That thy self hast a Thousand times preferred a stinking Lust before him:</HI> answer be it so, it is but what
<PB N="87" REF="003637_0046_10023A478E60B1D0"/>
is common to Men to do, nor doth the Lord <HI>Jesus</HI> make such a foolish Life a <HI>Barr</HI> to thee, to forbid thy coming to him, or a Bound to his Grace, that it might be kept from thee; but admits of thy Repentance, and offereth himself unto thee freely, as thou standest among the <HI>Jerusalem sinners.</HI></P>
<P>Take therefore Incouragement, Man, Mercy is by the Text held forth to the biggest Sinners. Yea, put thy self into the Number of the first, by reckoning that thou mayst be one of the first, and mayst not be put off till the biggest Sinners are served: For the biggest Sinners are first invited; consequently, if they come they are like to be the first that shall be served: 'Twas so with <HI>Jerusalem: Jerusalem sinners</HI> were they that were first invited; and those of them that came first, (and there came three thousand of them, the first Day they were invited, how many came afterwards none can tell) <HI>they were first served.</HI></P>
<P>Put in thy Name, Man among the big∣gest, lest thou art made to wait till they are served; you have some Men that think themselves very cunning, because they put up their Names in their Prayers among them that feign it, saying <HI>God I thank thee, I am not so bad as the worst</HI>; but believe it, if they be saved at all, they shall be saved in the last place: The first in their own Eyes shall be served last, and the last or
<PB N="88" REF="003637_0047_10023A2946C6B208"/>
worst shall be first: The Text insinuates it, <HI>Begin at Jerusalem,</HI> and Reason backs it, for they have most need. Behold ye therefore, how God's ways are above ours; we are for serving the worst last, God is for serving the worst first. The Man at the Pool that to my thinking was longest in his Disease, and most Help∣less as to his Cure, was first healed, yea, he only was healed; for we read that <HI>Christ</HI> healed him; but we read not then that he healed one more there, <HI>John</HI> 5.1, <HI>to</HI> 9.</P>
<P>Wherefore if thou wouldst soonest be ser∣ved, put in thy Name among the very worst of Sinners, say, when thou art upon thy Knees, Lord! <HI>Here is a Jerusalem sin∣ner</HI>; a Sinner of the biggest size, one whose Burden is of the greatest Bulk and heavi∣est Weight, one that cannot stand long without thy supporting Hand, <HI>Be not thou far from me, O Lord; O my strength, hast thou to help me.</HI></P>
<P>I say, put in thy name with <HI>Magdalen,</HI> with <HI>Manasseh,</HI> thou may'st fare as the <HI>Magdalen</HI> and the <HI>Mannasseh-sinners</HI> do. The Man in the Gospel, made the despe∣rate condition of his Child, an argu∣ment with <HI>Christ</HI> to hasten his cure: <HI>Sir come down saith he ere my Child die,</HI> Joh. 4.49. And Christ regarded his haste, saying <HI>Go thy way thy Son liveth,</HI> Ver. 50. <HI>Haste</HI> requires <HI>haste, David</HI> was for speed; Deli∣ver

me speedily; hear me speedily, answer me speedily, <HI>Psal.</HI> 31.2. <HI>Psal</HI> 69.17. <HI>Ps.</HI> 102 .2. But why speedily? I am in the <HI>Net,</HI> I am in Trouble; my Days consume like smoke, <HI>Psal.</HI> 31.4. <HI>Psal.</HI> 69.17. <HI>Ps.</HI> 102 3. Deep calleth unto deep; Necessity calls for Help, great Necessity for present Help.</P>
<P>Wherefore I say be ruled by me in that matter; feign not thy self another Man If thou hast been a filthy Sinner, but go in thy Colours to <HI>Jesus Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t,</HI> and put thy self among the most vile, and let him alone to put thee among the Children, <HI>Jer</HI> 3 19. Confess all that thou knowest of thy self, I know thou wilt find it hard work to do thus, especially if thy Mind be legal; but do it, least thou stay and be deferr'd with the little Sinners, until the great ones have had their Alms. What do you think <HI>David</HI> intended when he said, his Wounds stunk and were corrupted, but to hasten God to have Mercy upon him, and not to defer his Cure: <HI>Lord,</HI> says he, <HI>I am trou∣bled, I am bowed down greatly. I go mourning all the Day long. I am Feeble and sore broken, by reason of the Disqui∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment of my Heart,</HI> Psal. 38.3, <HI>to</HI> 7.</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> knew what he did by all this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e knew that his making the worst of his Case, was the way to speedy Help: And that a feigning and disembling the Matter
<PB N="90" REF="003637_0048_10023A41003062B8"/>
with God, was the next way to a demurr, as to his Forgiveness.</P>
<P>I have one thing more to offer for thy Encouragement who deemest thy self one of the biggest Sinners: And that is, thou art as it were called say thy Name, in the <HI>first place</HI> to come in for Mercy. Thou <HI>Man of Jerusalem,</HI> hearken to thy Call: Men do so in Courts of Judicature, and presently cry out, <HI>Here Sir</HI>; and then they shoulder, and croud, and say, pray give way, I am called into the Court. Why, this is thy Case; thou great, thou <HI>Je∣rusalem-sinner</HI> be of good Cheer, he call∣eth thee, <HI>Mark</HI> 10.46 <HI>to</HI> 49. Why sittest thou still; arise, why standest thou still? Come Man, thy Call shall give thee <HI>Au∣thority</HI> to come, <HI>Begin at Jerusalem,</HI> is thy Call and Authority to come: Where∣fore up and shoulder it Man; say, <HI>Stand away Devil,</HI> Christ calls me; Stand away <HI>Unbelief,</HI> Christ calls me; Stand away, all ye my discouraging Apprehensions, for my Saviour calls me to him to receive of his Mercy. Men will do thus, as I said, in Courts below; and why shouldst not thou approach thus to the Court above? The <HI>Jerusalem-sinner</HI> is first in Thought, first in Commission, first in the record of Names, and therefore should give Attendance wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h Expectation, that he is first to receive Mer∣cy of God.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="003637_0048_10023A41003062B8"/>Is not this an Encouragement to the big∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est Sinners, to make their Application to Christ for Mercy? <HI>Come unto me all ye that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abour and are heavy laden,</HI> doth also con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rm this thing, that is, that the biggest Sin∣ner, and he that has the biggest Burden, is he who is first invited.

<P>This Text therefore will save thee, or sink thee; there is no shifting of it: If it saves thee; it will set thee high; if it sinks thee, will set thee low,</P>
<P>But I say, why so unconcern'd? Hast no Soul? Or dost think thou mayst loose thy Soul, and save thy self? Is it not pity, had it otherwise been the Will of God that
<PB N="95" REF="003637_0050_100202292B50DA18"/>
ever thou wast made a Man, for that thou settest so little by thy Soul?</P>
<P>Sinner, take the Invitation; thou art call∣ed upon to come to Christ: Nor art thou called upon, but by order from the Son of God, tho' thou should'st happen to be one of the biggest Sinners: For he has bid us offer Mercy, as to all the World in general, so in the first place, to the Sinners of <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; or to the biggest Sinners.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Would Jesus Christ have Mer∣cy offered in the <HI>first place</HI> to the biggest Sinners? Then this shews how unreaso∣nable a thing it is, for Men to despair of Mercy. For those that presume, I shall say something to them afterwards.</P>
<P>I now speak to them that Despair.</P>
<P>There are four sorts of Despair, there is the Despair of Devils; There is the Des∣pair of Souls in Hell. There is the Des∣pair that is grounded upon Mens Deficien∣cy; And there is the Despair that they are perplexed with that are willing to be saved, but are too strongly born down with the Burthen of their Sins.</P>
<P>The Despair of Devils, the Damned's Despair, and that Despair that a Man has of attaining of Life, because of his own Deficiency, are all reasonable. Why should not Devils &amp; damned Souls Despair? Yea, why should not Man Despair of getting to Heaven by his own Abilities? I therefore
<PB N="96" REF="003637_0051_10023A9D1BB10510"/>
am concerned only with the Fourth sort of Dispair, to wit, with the Dispair of those that would be saved, but are too strongly born down with the Burden of their Sins.</P>
<P>I say therefore to thee that art thus, and why Dispair? Thy Dispair if it was rea∣sonable, should flow from thee, because found in the Land that is beyond the Grave, or because thou certainly knowest that Christ will not or cannot save thee.</P>
<P>But for the first, thou art yet in the Land of the living, and for the second, thou hast ground <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o believe the quite contrary; <HI>Christ</HI> is able to save to the uttermost, them that come to God by him; and if he were not willing, would not have commanded that Mercy in the <HI>first place</HI> should be offered to the biggest Sinners. Besides he hath said, <HI>And let him that is athirst come, and whosoever wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, let him take the Water of Life freely</HI>; that is with all my Heart. What ground now is here for Dispair? I thou sayest, The Number and Burden of my Sins. I answer Nay, that is rather a ground for Faith; because such an one a∣bove all others, is invited by Christ to come unto him, yea, promised Rest▪ and Forgiveness if they come, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28. What ground to dispair? Verily none at all Thy Despair, then is a thing unreasonable and without footing in the Word.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="003637_0051_10023A9D1BB10510"/>But I have no experience of God's love; God has given me no Comfort, or ground of hope, tho' I have waited upon him for it many a day.</P>
<P>Thou hast experience of God's Love, for that he has opened thine Eyes to see thy Sins; and for that he has given thee Desires to be saved by Jesus Christ. For by thy sense of Sin thou art made to see thy Poverty of Spirit, and that has laid thee under a sure Ground to hope that Heaven shall be thine hereafter.</P>

Not at all, so long as there is a Promise in the Bible▪ that God will in no wise cast away the coming Sinner, and so long as he invites the <HI>Je∣rusalem-sinner,</HI> to come unto him, John 6.37.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="003637_0052_10023AA9B739D140"/>Build not therefore Despair upon these things, they are not a sufficient Founda∣tion for it, such Plenty of Promises being in the Bible, and such a Discovery of his Mercy to great Sinners of old; especially since we have withal a clause in the Com∣mission given to Ministers to preach, that they should begin with the <HI>Jerusalem sin∣ners</HI> in their offering Mercy to the World.</P>

Dispair makes Man God's Judge; tis a Controller of the Promise, a Contradicte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Christ in his large offer of Mercy, and one that undertakes to make <HI>Unbelief</HI> the great manager of our Reason and Judg∣ment, in determining about what God can and will do for sinners.</P>

Wherefore take heed of this,
<PB N="104" REF="003637_0055_10023AAF3A7564A0"/>
and all may be well: For this Presumptu∣ousness is a very heinous thing in the Eyes of God: The Soul saith he, that shall do ought presumptuously (whether born in the Land, or a Stranger) the same re∣proacheth the Lord. <HI>And that Soul shall be cut off from among his People,</HI> Numb. 15.20.</P>
<P>The thoughts of this made <HI>David</HI> trem∣ble, and pray that God would hold him back from Presumptuous Sins, and not suffer them to have Dominion over him, <HI>Psal.</HI> 19.31.</P>
<P>Now this Presumption, then puts it self in the place of Faith when it tampereth with the Promise of Life, while the Soul is a stranger to Repentance: Wherefore you have in the Text, to prevent doing thus, both Repentance and Remission of Sins to be offered to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> not Remission with∣out Repentance; for all that repent not shall perish, let them presume on Grace, and the Promise while they will, <HI>Luke</HI> 13, 1, 2, 3.</P>
<P>Presumption then is that which severeth <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> concluding that the Soul shall be saved by Grace, tho' the Man was never made sorry for his Sins, nor the love of the Heart turned there from This is to be self willed, as <HI>Peter</HI> has it, And this is a despising the Word of the Lord, for that has put Repentance and Faith
<PB N="105" REF="003637_0055_10023AAF3A7564A0"/>
together, Mark 1.15. <HI>And because he hath despised the Word of the Lord and hath broken the Commandment, that Soul shall utterly be cut off, his Iniquities shall be upon him,</HI> Numb. 15.13.</P>
<P>Let such therefore look to it, who yet are and abide in their Sins; for such if they hope, they are to be saved, presume up∣on the Grace of God. Wherefore Presump∣tion and not Hearkning to God's word, are put together, <HI>Deut.</HI> 17.12.</P>
<P>Again, then Men presume when they are resolved to abide in their Sins, and yet expect to be saved by God's Grace thro' <HI>Christ</HI>: This is as much as to say God lik∣eth of Sin as well as I do, and careth not how Men live, if so be they lean upon his Son. Of this Sort are they that build up <HI>Zion</HI> with Blood, and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with Ini∣quity; that judge for reward, and teach for hire, and divine for Money, and lean upon the Lord, <HI>Mich.</HI> 3.10, 11. This is doing things with an high hand against the Lord our God, and a taking him as it were, at the Catch! This is, as we may say among Men, to seek to put a trick up∣on God, as if he had not sufficiently for∣tified his Proposals of Grace by his Holy Word, against all such kind of Fools as these. But look to it,</P>
<P>Such will be found at the Day of God, not among that great Company of <HI>Jeru∣salem-sinners,</HI>
<PB N="106" REF="003637_0056_10023AB1A14F6B88"/>
that shall be saved by Grace, but among those that have been the great abusers of the Grace of God, in the World. Those that say, <HI>Let us sin that Grace may abound, and let us do Evil that Good may come,</HI> their Damnation is just; and if so, they are a great way off of that Sal∣vation, that is by Jesus Christ presented to the <HI>Jerusalem-sinners.</HI></P>
<P>I have therefore these things to propound to that <HI>Jerusalem-sinner,</HI> that would know if he may be so bold to venture himself upon this Grace.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Dost thou see thy Sins?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Art thou weary of them?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Wouldst thou with all thy Heart be saved by Jesus Christ? I dare say no less, I dare say no more. But if it be truly thus with thee, how great soever thy Sins have been, how far soever thou art from thinking that God has Mercy for thee; thou art the Man, the <HI>Jerusalem-sinner,</HI> that the Word of God has conquer'd, and to whom it offereth free Remission of Sins, by the Redemption that is in Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>When the Jaylor cried out, <HI>Sirs, what must I do to be saved</HI>? The answer was, <HI>Believe on the Lord</HI> Jesus Christ, <HI>and thou shalt be saved.</HI> He that sees his Sins aright, is brought to his Wits end by them; and he that is so is willing to part from them &amp; to be saved by the Grace of God.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="003637_0056_10023AB1A14F6B88"/>If this be the Case, fear not, give no way to Dispair, thou presumest not, if thou believest to Life everlasting in <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> Yea, Christ is prepared for such as thou art.</P>
<P>Therefore take good courage and believe. The design of Satan is to tell the Presump∣tuous that their presuming on Mercy is good; but to perswade the Believer, that his believing is impudent bold dealing with God. I never heard a presumptuous Man in my Life, say that he was afraid that he presumed; but I have heard many an ho∣nest humble Soul say, that they have been afraid that their Faith has been Presump∣tion. Why should Satan molest those, whose ways he knows will bring them to him? And who can think that he should be quiet, when Men take the right course to escape his hellish snares? This therefore is the Reason why the truly humbled is opposed, while the Presumptuous goes on by <HI>Wind</HI> and <HI>Tide.</HI> The truly humble, Satan hates; but he laughs to see the Foolery of the other.</P>
<P>Does thy Hand and Heart tremble? Upon thee the Promise smiles, <HI>To this Man will I look,</HI> says God, <HI>even 'to him that is poor and of a contrite Spirit, and trembles at my Word,</HI> Isa. 66.2.</P>
<P>What therefore I have said of Presump∣tion, concerns not the humble in Spirit at
<PB N="108" REF="003637_0057_10023AB417F0C4D8"/>
all: I therefore am for gathering up the Stones, and for taking the stumbling Blocks out of the way of God's People; and for∣warning of them that they lay the stumb∣ling Block of their Iniquity before their Faces, and that are for presuming upon God's Mercy; and let them look to them∣selves, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 14.6, 7, 8.</P>
<P>Also our Text stands firm as ever it did, and our observation is still of force, That <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> would have Mercy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners. So then let none Dispair, let none Presume: Let none Dispair that are sorry for their Sins, and would be saved by Jesus Christ. Let none resume that abide in the liking of their Sins; tho' they seem to know the exceeding Grace of Christ; for tho' the Door stand wide open for the reception of the Penitent, yet 'tis fast enough barred and bolted against the presumptuous Sinner. Be not deceived, God is not mocked; what∣soever a Man sows, that he shall reap. It cannot be that God should be wheadled out of his Mercy, or prevailed upon by Lips of Dissimulation; He knows them that trust in him▪ and that sincerely come to him by Christ for Mercy, <HI>Nahum</HI> 1.9.</P>
<P>It is then, not the abundance of Sin com∣mitted, but the not coming heartily to God by Christ for Mercy, that shuts Men
<PB N="109" REF="003637_0057_10023AB417F0C4D8"/>
out of Doors: And tho' their not coming heartily may be said to be but a Sin; yet 'tis such a Sin, as causeth that all the other Sins abide upon the unforgiven.</P>
<P>God complains of this, <HI>they have not cried unto me with their Heart; they turned, but not to the most High. They turned feignedly,</HI> Jer 3, 10. Hos. 7.14.16.</P>
<P>Thus doing, his Souls hates; but the penitent, humble, broken-hearted Sinner, be his Transgressions red as Scarlet, red like Crimson, in number as the sand, tho' his Transgressions cry to Heaven against him for Vengeance, and seem there to cry louder than do his Prayers, or Tears, or Groans, for Mercy; yet he is safe. To this Man God will look, Isa. 1.18 <HI>ch.</HI> 66.2.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> Would Jesus Christ have Mer∣cy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners? Then here is ground for those that as to practice have not been such, to come to him for Mercy.</P>
<P>Altho' there is no Sin little of it self, be∣cause it is a Contradiction to the Nature and Majesty of God; yet we must admit of divers Numbers, and also of Aggravati∣ons, two Sins are not so many as three; nor are three that are done in Ignorance so big as one that is done against light, a∣gainst Knowlege, and Conscience. Also there is the Child in Sin, and a Man in Sin; that has his Skin wrinkled for very
<PB N="110" REF="003637_0058_10023AB66C331810"/>
Age. And we must put a Difference be∣twixt these Sinners al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o: For can it be, that a Child of Seven, or ten, or sixteen Years old, should be such a Sinner; a Sin∣ner so vile in Eye of the Law, as he is who has walked according to the course of this World, forty, fifty, sixty or seventy Years? Now the Youth, this stripling, tho' he is a Sinner, is but a little Sinner, when compared with such.</P>
<P>Now I say, if there be room for the first sort, for those of the biggest size; If there be a Door wide enough for a Giant to go in at, there is certainly room for a Dwarf. If Christ Jesus has Grace enough to save great Sinners, he has surely Grace enough to save little ones. If he can forgive, five hundred Pence, for certain he can forgive fifty, Luke 7.41, 42.</P>
<P>But you said before that the little Sinners must stand by, until the great ones have received their Grace, and that's discoura∣ging!</P>
<P>I answer, There are two sorts of little Sinners, such as are so, and such as feign themselves so; they are those that feign themselves so, that I intended there, and not those that are indeed comparatively so. Such as feign themselves so, may wait long enough before they obtain Forgiveness.</P>
<P>But again, a Sinner may be comparative∣ly a little Sinner, and sensibly a great one.
<PB N="111" REF="003637_0058_10023AB66C331810"/>
There is then two sorts of greatness in Sin; greatness by reason of Number, greatness by reason of throughness of Conviction of the horrible Nature of Sin. In this last Sense, he that has but one Sin, if such a one could be found, may in his own Eyes find himself the biggest Sinner in the World. Let this Man, or this Child therefore put himself among the great Sinners, and plead with God as great Sinners do, and expect to be saved with the great Sinners; as soon and as heartily as they.</P>
<P>Yea, a little Sinner, that comparatively is truly so, if he shall graciously give way to Conviction, and shall in God's light, dilligently weigh the horrible Nature of his own Sins may yet sooner obtain For∣giveness for them at the hands of the hea∣venly Father, than he that has ten times his Sins, and so cause to cry ten times harder to God for his Mercy.</P>
<P>For the grievousness of the Cry is a great thing with God; for if he will hear the Widow if she cries at all, how much if she cries most grievously? <HI>Exod.</HI> 22.22, 23.</P>
<P>It is not the number, but the true sense of the abominable Nature of Sin, that makes the cry for Pardon Lamentable. He, as I said, that has many Sins may not cry so loud in the Ears of God as he that has far fewer; he in our present sense, that is in his own Eyes the biggest Sinner, is he that soonest findeth Mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="003637_0059_10023A98F714A5A0"/>The offer then is to the biggest Sinner to the biggest Sinner first, and the Mercy is first obtained, by him that first confes∣seth himself to be such an one.</P>
<P>There are Men that strive at the Throne of Grace for Mercy by pleading the great∣ness of their Necessity. Now their Plea, as to the prevalency of it, lieth not in their counting up of the number, but in their sense of the greatness of their Sins, and in the Vehemency of their Cry for Pardon. And it is observable, that tho' the Birth∣right was <HI>Reubens,</HI> and for his Foolishness, given to the Sons of <HI>Joseph</HI>; yet <HI>Judah</HI> prevailed before his Brethren, and of him came the <HI>Messias</HI> 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 5.1, 3.</P>
<P>There is a heavenly Subtilty to be man∣aged in this matter, <HI>Thy Brother came with Subtilty and hath taken thy Blessing</HI> The Blessing belonged to <HI>Esau,</HI> but <HI>Jacob</HI> by his Diligence made it his own, <HI>Gen.</HI> 27.35. The offer is to the biggest Sinner; to the biggest Sinner first, but if he for∣bears to cry, the Sinner that is a Sinner less by far than he, both as to the Number and the Nature of Transgression, may get the Blessing first, if he should have Grace to bestir himself well, for the loudest cry is heard furthest; and the most lamentable, pierces soonest.</P>
<P>I therefore urge this Head, not because I would have little Sinners go and tell God
<PB N="113" REF="003637_0059_10023A98F714A5A0"/>
that they are little Sinners, thereby to think to obtain his Mercy; for verily, so they are never like to have it: For such words declare, that such a one hath no true sense at all of the nature of his Sins.</P>
<P>Sin, as I said, in the Nature of it, is horrible; tho' it be but one single sin as to act; ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, tho' it be but a sinful thought, and so worthily calls for the Damnation of the Soul.</P>
<P>The Comparison then, of little &amp; great sinners, is to go for good sense among Men: But to plead the fewness of thy sins, or the comparative harmlessness of their quality before God, argueth no sound Know∣ledge of the Nature of thy sin, and so no true sense of the Nature or Need of Mercy.</P>
<P>Little sinner, when therefore thou goest to God, tho' thou knowest in thy Con∣science, that thou as to acts are no Thief, no Murderer, no Whore, no Liar, no false <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wearer, or the like; and in Reason must understand, that then thou art not so pro∣fanely Vile as others; yet when thou goest to God for Mercy, know no Mans sins but thine own, make mention of no Mans sins but thine own. Also labour not to lessen thy own, but magnifie and greaten them by all just Circumstances, and be as if there was never a sinner in the World but thy self. Also cry out as if thou wast the on∣ly undone Man, and that is the way to obtain God's Mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="003637_0060_10023AA6878E76A8"/>It was one of the comliest Lights in the World, to see a little sinner commenting upon the greatness of his sins; and multi∣plying them to himself; till he makes them in his own Eyes bigger and bigger than he seeth any other Mans sins to be in the World; and as base a thing it is to see a Man do otherwise, and as basely will come on't <HI>Luke</HI> 18.10, 11, 12, 13.</P>
<P>As therefore I said to the great sinner before, let him take heed lest he presumes, I say now to the little sinner, let him take heed that he don't dissemble: For there is as great an Aptness in the little sinner to dissemble, as there is in the great one. <HI>He that hideth his sins shall not Prosper,</HI> be he a little sinner or great, <HI>Prov.</HI> 18 13.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> Would Jesus Christ have Mer∣cy offered in the <HI>first place</HI> to the biggest sinner? Then this shews the true cause why Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an makes such head as he doth a∣gainst him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> are well spoken of by all Deluders and deceived Persons; Christ only is the Rock of Of∣fence. <HI>Behold I lay in Zion a stumbling Stone and a Rock of Offence,</HI> Rom. 9.33. Nor that <HI>Satan</HI> careth for the Father or the <HI>Spirit,</HI> more than he careth for the <HI>Son</HI>; but he can let Men alone with their Noti∣ons of the Father and the Spirit, for he knows they shall never enjoy the Father,

nor the Spirit, if indeed they receive not the Merits of the Son: <HI>He that hath the Son hath Life, he that hath not the Son <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f God hath not Life</HI>; however they may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oast themselves of the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Spirit,</HI> 1 Joh. 5.12. Again, <HI>Whosoever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ransgresseth, and abideth not in the Doc∣trine of Christ, hath not God: He that a∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ideth in the Doctrine of Christ, hath both the Father and the Son,</HI> 2 Joh. 9.</P>
<P><HI>Christ, and Christ only, is he that can make us capable to enjoy God with Life and Joy, to all Eternity. Hence he calls himself the way to the Father, the true and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iving way,</HI> Joh. 14.6. Heb. 10.19, 20. <HI>For he cannot come to the Father but by him: Satan</HI> knows this, therefore he hates him: Deluded Persons are ignorant of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd therefore they are so led up and down <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <HI>Satan,</HI> by the Nose as they are.</P>
<P>There are many things by which <HI>Satan</HI> has taken Occasion to greaten his Rage against Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>As first, His Love to Man, and then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he many Expressions of that Love.

Key of Death? And all these are heinous things to <HI>Satan.</HI> He cannot abide Christ for this. Besides he hath eternal Life in himself, and that to bestow upon us, and we in all likelihood are to possess the very place from which <HI>Satan</HI> by Transgres∣sion fell, if not places more Glorious: Wherefore he must needs be angry. And is it not a vexatious thing to him, that we should be admitted to the Throne of Grace by Christ, while he stands bound over in Chains of Darkness, to answer for his Rebellions against <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>Son,</HI> at the terrible Day of Judgment? Yea, we poor Dust and Ashes must become his Judges, and Triumph over him forever; and all this long of Jesus Christ; for he is the Meritorious Cause of all this. Now tho' <HI>Satan</HI> seeks to be revenged for this, yet he knows it is in vain to attack the Per∣son of Christ, he has overcome him; there∣fore he tampers with Company of silly Men, that we may Villifie him by them, And they, bold Fools as they are, will not spare to spit in his Face, they will rail at his Person; and deny the very being of it; they will rail at his Blood, and deny the Merit and worth of it. They will de∣ny the very end, why he accomplished the Law, and by Jiggs, and tricks, and quirks which he helped them to, set up son▪ Names and Images in his place and give

the Glory of a Saviour to them. Thus Sa∣tan worketh under the Name of <HI>Christ,</HI> and his Ministers under the Name of the Ministers of Righteousness.</P>
<P>And by his Wiles and Stratagems he un∣does a World of Men: But there is a Seed, and they shall serve him, and it shall be counted to the Lord for a Generation.

<P>All this Satan knows, and therefore his Rage is kindled the more. Wherefore ac∣cording to his Ability and Allowance, he assaulteth, tempteth, abuseth, and stirs up what he can to be hurtful to these poor People; that he may, while his time shall last, make it as hard and difficult for them to go to eternal Glory as he can. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten∣times he Abuses them with wrong Appre∣hensions of God, and with wrong Appre∣hensions of Christ; he also casts them into the mire, to the reproach of Religion, the shame of their Brethren, the Derision of the World, and Dishonour of God. He holds our Hands while the World buffets as, he puts Bear skins upon us, and then sets the Dogs at us. He bedawbeth us with his own Foam, and then tempts us to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elieve that that bedawbing comes from our selves.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="003637_0062_1002022691523058"/>Oh! the rage and the roaring of this Lion! And the hatred that he manifests against the Lord Jesus, and against them that are purchased with his Blood!

<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> Would <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> have Mer∣cy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinner? <HI>Let the tempted harp upon this string for their Help and Consolation.</HI> The Tempted wherever he dwells, always thinks himself the biggest Sinner, one most unworthy of Eternal Life.</P>
<P>This is Satans Master-Argument, Thou art a horrible Sinner, a Hypocrite, one that has a prophane Heart, and one that is an utter stranger to a work of Grace. I say, this is his Maul, his Club, his Master-piece:
<PB N="119" REF="003637_0062_1002022691523058"/>
He doth with this, as some do by their most inchanting Songs, sings them every where. I believe there are but few Saints in the World that have not had this Temp∣tation sounding in their Ears. But were they but aware, Satan by all this does but drive them to the Gap, out at which they should go, and so escape his roaring.</P>
<P>Saith he, Thou art a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sinner, a horri∣ble Sinner, a profane hearted Wretch, one that cannot be matcht for a vile one in the Country.</P>
<P>And all this while <HI>Christ</HI> says to his Mi∣nisters, offer Mercy in the first place to the biggest Sinners. So that this Temptation drives thee directly into the Arms of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Was therefore the Tempted but aware he might say, Ay Satan, for I am, I am a Sinner of the biggest size, and therefore have most need of <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI> Yea, be∣cause I am such a wretch? therefore <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> calls me; yea, he calls me first: The first proffer of the Gospel is to be made to the <HI>Jerusalem-sinner</HI>: I am he, wherefore stand back Satan, make a <HI>Lane,</HI> my right is first to come to <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>This now would be like for like. This would foil the Devil: This would make him say, I must not deal with this Man thus; for then I put a Sword into his Hand to cut off my Head.</P>

Satan and my Conscience says, I am the biggest Sinner, Christ offereth Mercy in the first place to the biggest Sinners. Nor is the manner of the offer other, but such as suiteth with my kind.

<P>I speak not this to lessen my Wicked∣ness: I would not for all the World; but be placed by my own Conscience in the very front of the biggest Sinners, that I might be one of the first that were beck∣ned by the Gracious Hand of <HI>Jesus</HI> the Saviour to come to him for Mercy.</P>

<P>This improving of Christ in dark Hours, is the Life, thro' the hardest part of our Christianity.

<P>There is nothing like Faith to help at a Pinch, Faith dissolves Doubts, as the Sun drives away the Mists, and that you may not be put out, know your time as I said, of believing, is always.

<P>Nor can we have better Encouragement to do this, than is by the Text set before us, even an open Heart for a <HI>Jerusalem-sinner,</HI> and if for a <HI>Jerusalem-sinner</HI> to come, then for such an one when come, if such an one to be saved, than for such an one that is saved. If such a one to be par∣doned his great Transgressions, then for such a one who has pardoned these, to come daily to <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> too, to be clean∣sed and set free from common Infirmities, and from the Iniquities of his holy things.</P>
<P>Therefore let the poor Sinner that would be saved, labour for Skill to make the best Improvement of the Grace of Christ, to help him against the Temptations of the Devil and his Sins.</P>
<P><HI>Tenthly,</HI> Would <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> have Mer∣cy offered in the <HI>first place</HI> to the biggest Sinners? Let these Men consider this that (have or) may in a Day of Trial, have spoken or done what their Profession or

Conscience told them they should not; and that bare the guilt &amp; burthen thereof upon their Consciences.</P>
<P>Whether a thing be wrong or right, Guilt may pursue him that doth contrary to his Conscience. But suppose a Man should deny his God or his Christ, or re∣linquish a good Profession, and be under the real guilt thereof? Shall he therefore conclude he is gone for ever. Let him come again with <HI>Peter's</HI> Tears, and no doubt but he shall obtain <HI>Peter's</HI> Forgiv∣ness. For the Text <HI>includes the biggest Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>And 'tis observable, That <HI>before this Clause</HI> was put into this Commission; <HI>Peter</HI> was pardoned his horrible Revolt from his Master. He that Revolteth in the Day of Trial, if he is not shot quite dead upon the place, but is sensible of his wound, and calls out for a <HI>Chyrurgeon,</HI> shall find his Lord at Hand to pour Wine and Oyl into his Wounds, that he may a∣gain be healed: And to incourage him to think that there may be. Mercy for him, besides what we find recorded of <HI>Peter,</HI> you read in the <HI>Acts,</HI> some was thro' the Violence of their Trials, compelled to Blaspheme, and yet are called Saints, <HI>Acts</HI> 26.9, 10, 11.</P>
<P>Hence you have a Promise or two that speaks concerning such a kind of Men, to
<PB N="124" REF="003637_0065_10023A9B5EFD26B8"/>
incourage us to think that at least some of them shall come back to the Lord their God. Shall they <HI>fall,</HI> saith he, and not <HI>arise</HI>? Shall they <HI>turn away</HI> and not <HI>re∣turn</HI>? Jer. 8.4. <HI>And in that day I will assemble her that halteth, and I will ga∣ther her that was driven out, and her that I have afflicted. And I will make her that halteth a Remnant, and her that was cast off, a strong Nation; and the Lord shall Reign over them in Mount Zion for ever.</HI> What are we to understand by her that halteth, is best express'd by the Prophet <HI>Ei∣jah, Mich.</HI> 4.6, 7. <HI>Zeph.</HI> 3.19. 1 Kings 18.21.</P>
<P>I will conclude then, that for them that have halted, or may halt, the Lord has Mercy in Bank, and is willing to accept them, if they return to him again.</P>
<P>Perhaps they may never be after that, of any great Esteem in the House of God; but if the Lord will admit them to Favour and Forgiveness: O exceeding and unde∣serv'd Mercy! <HI>Ezek.</HI> 44.10 to 14.</P>
<P>Thou then that mayst be the Man, Re∣member this, that there is Mercy also for thee: Return therefore to God and to his Son, who hath yet in stone for thee, and who will do thee good.</P>
<P>But perhaps thou wilt say he doth not save all Revolters, and therefore perhaps not me.</P>

<P>Some as I said, that Revolt, are shot dead upon the Place; and for them, who can help them? But for them that cry out of their Wounds, 'tis a sign they are yet alive; and if they use the Means in time, doubtless they may be healed.</P>
<P>Christ Jesus has bags of <HI>Mercy</HI> that were never yet broken up or unsealed. Hence it is said, he has Goodness laied up; things reserved in Heaven for his. And if he breaks up one of these Bags, who can tell what he can do!</P>
<P>Hence his Love is said to be such as passeth Knowledge, and that his Riches are unsearchable. He has no body knows what; for no body knows who! He has by him in store for such as seem in the view of all Men, to be gone beyond Re∣covery. For this is the Text in plain, What Man or Angel could have thought the <HI>Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usalem-sinners</HI> had not yet been on this side of Impossibility of enjoying Life and Mercy? Hadst thou seen their Actions and what horrible things they did to the Son of God? Yea, how stoutly they back∣ed what they did, with Resolves and En∣deavours to persevere, when they had killed his Person, against his Name and Doctrine:
<PB N="126" REF="003637_0066_10023AAC1C339AC0"/>
And that there was not found among them, all that while, as we read of, the least Re∣morse or Regret for these their doings Couldst thou have imagined that Mercy would ever take hold of them, at least so soon! Nay that they should of all the World, be counted those only meet to have it offered to them in the very first place▪ For so my Text commands, saying, <HI>Preach Repentance and Remission of Sins among all Nations, Beginning at Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>I tell you the thing is a Wonder, and must for ever stand for a Wonder among the Sons of Men; It stands also for an everlasting Invitation and Allurement to the biggest Sinners to come to <HI>Christ</HI> for Mercy.</P>
<P>Now, since in the Opinion of all Men, the Revolter is such a one; if he has as I said before, any Life in him, let him take In∣couragement to come again, that he may live by Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Eleventhly,</HI> Would <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> have Mer∣cy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners? Then let God's Ministers tell them so.

nothing was ever spoken truer of him by the World.

Why not familiar with Sinners, provided we hate their Spots and Blemishes, and seek that they may be healed of them.</P>
<P>Why not Fellowly with our Carnal Neighbours, if we take occasion to do so, that we may drop and be yet distilling some good Doctrine upon their Souls? Why not go to the poor Man's House, and give him a <HI>Penny,</HI> and a Scripture to think upon? Why not send for the poor to fetch away at least the Fragments of thy Table, that the Bowels of thy Fellow sinner may be refresht as well as thine.</P>
<P>Ministers should be Exemplary: But I am an inferior Man, and must take heed of too much medling, But might I, I would meddle with them, with their Wives, and with their Children too.

<P>But I say, let Ministers follow the steps of their Lord, who by Words and Deeds shewed his Love to the Salvation of the World in such a Carriage, as declared him to pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er their Salvation before his own pri∣vate Concern: For we are commanded to follow his Steps, <HI>who did no Sin neither was Guile sound in his Mouth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="003637_0067_10020250A49A8390"/>And as I have said concerning Ministers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o I say to all the Brethren, carry it so, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat all the World may see that indeed you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re the Sons of Love.</P>

Practical Love is best. Many love Christ with nothing but their Tongue. Alas!

<P>Practical Love which stands in self-deni∣al, in Charity to my Neighbour, and a Patient enduring of Affliction for his Name. This is counted Love.</P>
<P>Right Love to Christ, is that which car∣ries in it a provoking Argument to others of the Brethren, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.24.</P>
<P>Should a Man ask me how he should know that he loved the Chiidren of God? The best answer I could give him, would be in the Words of the Apostle <HI>John; By this</HI> saith he, <HI>we know we love the Chil∣dren of God, when we love God and keep his Commandments,</HI> 1 Joh. 5.2.</P>
<P>Love to God and Christ is then shewn, when we are tender of his Name, and then we shew our selves tender of his Name, when we are afraid to break any, the least of his Commandments. And when we are here, then do we shew our Love to our Brother also.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="003637_0068_10023AA25ABF0008"/>Now we have Obligation sufficient thus to do, for that our Lord loved us, and gave himself for us, to deliver us from Death, that we might live thro' him.</P>
<P>The World, when they hear the doctrine that I have asserted and handled in this little Book, to wit, That Jesus Christ would have Mercy offered in the first place to the biggest Sinners; will be apt, because themselves are Unbelievers, to think that this is a Doctrine that leads to Loosness, and that gives Liberty to the Flesh; but if you that believe love your Brethren, and your Neighbours truly, and as you should, you will put to Silence the Ignorance of such foolish Men, and stop their Mouths from speaking Evil of you.</P>

<PB N="131" REF="003637_0068_10023AA25ABF0008"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y all, unworthy of the name of a Chris∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ian, and should be shunned by every good Man, as such who are the very Plague of Profession.</P>
<P>For so it is written, we should carry it to∣wards them: Whoso has a form of Godli∣ness, and denys the Power thereof, from such we must turn away.</P>
<P>It has oft-times come into my Mind to ask by what Means it is, that the Gospel Profession should be so haunted with loose and carnal Gospelers? And I could never arrive to better Satisfaction in the matter than this: Such Men are made Professors by the Devil, and so by him put among the rest of the Godly. A certain Man had a fruitless Fig-tree planted in his Vineyard; but by whom was it planted there? Even him that sowed the Tares, his own Children among the Wheat, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.6. <HI>Mat.</HI> 1.37, <HI>to</HI> 40. And that was the Devil. But why doth the Devil do thus: Not of love to them, but to make of them Offences and stumbling-blocks to others. For he knows that a loose professor in the Church, does more mischief to Religion than ten can do to it that are in the World.</P>
<P>Was it not, think you, the Devil that stirred up the Damsel that you read of in <HI>Acts</HI> 16. to cry out, <HI>These are the Servants of the most high God that shew unto us the way of Salvation</HI>; Yes, it was as is evident,
<PB N="132" REF="003637_0069_10023AC039D7C8F8"/>
for <HI>Paul</HI> was grieved to hear it. But why did the Devil stir up her to cry so? But because that was the way to blemish the Gospel, to make the World think that it came from the same hand as did her Sooth-saying and Witchery, v. 16, 17, 18. <HI>Holi∣ness O Lord, becomes thy House for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Let therefore, whoever they be that pro∣fess the Name of Christ, take heed that that scandal not profession which they make of him, since he has so graciously offered us, as we are Sinners of the biggest size, in the first place his Grace to save us.</P>
<P>Having thus far spoken of the Riches of the Grace of Christ, and of the the Free∣ness of his Heart to embrace the <HI>Jerusalem-sinners,</HI> it may not be amiss to give you yet as a Caution, an Intimation of one thing, namely, <HI>That this Grace and Freeness of the Heart is limited to Time and Day, the which whoso</HI> overstandeth, <HI>shall Perish notwithstanding.</HI></P>
<P>For, as a King who of Grace, sendeth out to his rebellious People, an Offer of Pardon, if they accept thereof by such a Day, yet be∣headeth or hangeth, those that come not in for Mercy until the Day or Time be past. So Christ Jesus has set the Sinner a Day of Salvation, and acceptable times; but he who standeth out, or goeth on in Rebelli∣on beyond that time, is like to come off with the loss of his Soul. 2 Cor. 6.2. Heb.
<PB N="133" REF="003637_0069_10023AC039D7C8F8"/>
3.13, 16 <HI>to</HI> 19. <HI>Chap.</HI> 4 7. Luk. 19.31.42.</P>
<P>Since therefore things are thus, it may. be convenient here to touch a little upon these Particulars.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That this day or time thus limited when it is considered with Reference to this or that Man, is oft-times undiscerned by the Person concerned therein; and always is kept secret as to the shutting up thereof.</P>
<P>And this in the Wisdom of God is thus to the end, no Man when called upon, should put off turning to God to another time: Now and to Day, is that, and only that which is revealed in Holy Writ, <HI>Psal.</HI> 50.22. <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12.1. <HI>Heb.</HI> 3.13, 16.</P>
<P>And this shews us the desperate hazards which those Men run, who when Invitati∣on or Conviction attends them, put off turn∣ing to God to be saved till another, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they think a more fit Season and time; for many by so doing defer this to Day, till the Day of God's Patience and long suffer∣ing is ended: and then, for their Prayers and Crys after Mercy, they receive nothing but Mocks, and are laughed at by the God of Heaven, <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.20 <HI>to</HI> 29. <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.65.12 <HI>to</HI> 17. <HI>Chap.</HI> 66.4. <HI>Zech.</HI> 7.11, 12.13.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Another thing to be consider∣ed is this, namely, that the Day of God's Grace with some Men begins sooner, and also sooner ends, than it doth with others. Those at the first Hour of the Day, had
<PB N="134" REF="003637_0070_1002022BA35B54A0"/>
their Call sooner than they who were call∣ed upon to turn to God, at the <HI>Sixth</HI> Hour of the Day; yea, and they who were hired at the <HI>Third</HI> Hour, had their Call sooner than they who were called at the <HI>Eleventh, Matth.</HI> 20.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Day of God's Patience began with <HI>Ishmael,</HI> and also ended before he was twenty Years old. At thirteen Years of Age he was Circumcised; and the next Year after <HI>Isaac</HI> was born, and then <HI>Ishmael</HI> was fourteen Years old: Now that Day that <HI>Isaac</HI> was weaned, that Day was <HI>Ishmael</HI> rejected; and suppose that <HI>Isaac</HI> was three Years old before he was weaned; that Day was but the seventeenth Year of <HI>Ishmael,</HI> wherefore then the Day of God's Grace was ended with him betimes, <HI>Gen.</HI> 27.24.25. <HI>Chap.</HI> 21.2. <HI>to</HI> 10. <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.30.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Cain's</HI> Days ended with him betimes, for after God had rejected him, he lived to beget many Children, and built a City, and to do many other things.</P>
<P>But alas, all that while he was a Fugative and a Vagabond. Nor carried he any thing with him after the Day of his Rejection was come, but this doleful Language in his Conscience, <HI>from God's Face shall I be hid.</HI> Gen. 4.10 <HI>to</HI> 14.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Esau</HI> thro' his Extravigancies, would needs go sell his Birth right, not fearing (as other confident Fools) but that yet
<PB N="135" REF="003637_0070_1002022BA35B54A0"/>
the Blessing would still be his, after which he liv'd many Years, but all of them under the Wrath of God, as was when time came, made appear to his Destruction; for <HI>when be would have inherited the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essing, he was rejected, for he found no place of Re∣pentance, tho' he sought it carefully with Tears,</HI> Heb. 12.14, 15, 16,</P>
<P>Many Instances might be given as to such Tokens of the Displeasure of God, a∣gainst such as fool away, as the Wise Man has it, the Prize put into his Hand, <HI>Prov.</HI> 17.16.</P>
<P>Let these things therefore be a further Caution to those that fit under the glorious Sound of the Gospel, and hear of the Rich∣es of the Grace of God in Christ to poor Sinners.</P>
<P>To slight Grace, to despise Mercy, and to stop the Ear when God speaks, when he speaks such great th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gs so much to our Profit, is a great Provocation.</P>
<P>He offereth, he calls, he wooes, he in∣vites, he prays, he beseeches us, in this Day of his Grace to be reconciled to him; yea, and has provided for us the Means of Re∣conciliation himself: Now this despised must needs be provoking, and it is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the living God.</P>
<P>But some Men may say unto me, Fain I would be saved, fain I would be saved by Christ; But I fear this Day of Grace is
<PB N="136" REF="003637_0071_10023A940C3B35D8"/>
past, and that I shall perish, notwithstand∣ing the exceeding Riches of the Grace of God.</P>
<P><HI>Answer,</HI> To this Doubt I would answer several Things.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> With respect to this Day.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> With respect to thy Desires.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> With respect to thy Fears.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> With respect to the Day: That is Whether it be ended with a Man or no?</P>
<P N="1">1. Art thou jogged and shaken, and mo∣lested at the hearing of the Word? Is thy Conscience awakened and convinced that thou art at present in perishing State, and that thou hast need to cry to God for Mer∣cy? This is a hopeful Sign that this Day of Grace is not past with thee. For usu∣ally they that are past Grace, are also in their Conscience past feeling, being seared with a hot Iron, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.18, 19. 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.1, 2.</P>
<P>Consequently those past Grace, must be such as are denied the awakening Fruits of the Word Preached. The Dead that hear, says Christ, shall live, at least Christ has not quite done with them, the Day of God's Patience is not at an end with them, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.25.</P>
<P N="2">2. Is there in thy more retired Condition, Arguings, Struglings, and Strivings with thy Spirit, to perswade thee off the Vanity of what vain Things thou lovest, and to win
<PB N="137" REF="003637_0071_10023A940C3B35D8"/>
thee in thy Soul, to a Choice of Christ Jesus, and his heavenly things? Take heed and Rebel not, for the Day of God's Grace and Patience will not be past with thee, till he saith, <HI>His Spirit shall not strive no more with thee:</HI> For then the Woe comes, when he shall depart from them, and when he says to the means of Grace, <HI>Let them alone,</HI> Hos. 4.17. <HI>Chap.</HI> 9.12.</P>
<P N="3">3. Art thou troubled in the Night Sea∣sons with Dreams about thy State, and that thou art in Danger of being lost? Hast thou Heart-shaking Apprehensions when dead Sleeps fall upon thee; of Hell, Death and Judgment to come? These are Signs that God has not wholly left thee, or cast the behind his Back for ever. <HI>For God speaks once, yea twice, yet Man perceives it not, in a Dream, in a Vision of the Night, when deep Sleep falls upon Man in slumbring upon the Bed; when he openeth the Ears of Men, and sealeth their Instruction, that he may withdraw Man from his Purpose,</HI> (his sinful Purposes) <HI>and hide Pride from Man,</HI> Job 33.14, 15, 16, 17.</P>
<P>All this while God has not left the Sin∣ners, nor is come to the end of his Patience towards him, but stands at least with the Door of Grace a jar in his Hand, as being loth as yet to bolt it against him.</P>
<P N="4">4. Art thou followed with Affliction, and dost thou hear God's angry Voice in
<PB N="138" REF="003637_0072_10023A969ED92010"/>
thy Afflictions? Doth he send with the Af∣fliction an Interpreter to shew thee thy Vileness, and why or wherefore the Hand of God is upon thee, and upon what thou hast; <HI>to wit,</HI> that it is for thy sinning a∣gainst him, and that thou mightest he turn∣ed to him? If so, thy Summer is not quite ended, thy Harvest is not yet quite over and gone, Take heed, stand out no longer, least he cause Darkness, and least thy Feet stumble upon the dark Mountains; and least while you look for Light, he turn it into the Shadow of Death, and make it gross Darkness, <HI>Jer.</HI> 8.20. <HI>Chap.</HI> 13.15, 16, 17.</P>
<P N="5">5. Art thou crossed, disappointed, and waylaid, and overthrown in all thy foolish▪ Ways and Doings? This is a sign God has not quite left thee, but that he still waits upon thee to turn thee. Consider I say, has he made a Hedge and a Wall to stop thee? Has he crossed thee in all thou put∣test thy Hand unto? Take it as a Call to turn to him, for by his thus doing he shews he has a Mind to give thee a better Porti∣on. For usually when God gives up Men and resolves to let them alone in the broad Way, he gives them <HI>Rope,</HI> and lets them have their Desires in all hurtful Things, <HI>Hos.</HI> 2.6 <HI>to</HI> 14. <HI>Psal.</HI> 73.4 <HI>to</HI> 12. <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.9.</P>
<P>Therefore take heed to this also, that thou strive not against this Hand of God▪ but
<PB N="139" REF="003637_0072_10023A969ED92010"/>
betake thy self to serious Enquiry into the Causes of this Hand of God upon thee, and encline to think 'tis because the Lord would have thee look to that which is better than what thou wouldst satisfie thyself with∣al. When God had a Mind to make the Prodigal go Home to his Father, he sent a Famine upon him, and denied him a Belly full of the Husks which the Swine did eat. And observe it, now he was in his Strait, betook himself to Consideration of the Good that there was in his Father's House; yea, he resolved to go Home to his Father; and his Father dealt well with him, received him with Musick and Dancing, because he had received him safe and sound, <HI>Luke</HI> 15.</P>
<P N="6">6. Hast thou any inticing Touches of the Word of God upon thy Mind? Doth as it were some holy Word of God give a Glance upon thee, cast a Smile upon thee, let fall, tho' it be but one Drop of its Favour upon thy Spirit; yea, tho' it stays but one Moment with thee? O! then the Day of Grace is not past! The Gate of Heaven is not shut! nor God's Heart and Bowels withdrawn from thee as yet. Take heed therefore, and beware that thou make much of the hea∣venly Gift, and of that good Word of God, of which he has made thee taste. Beware, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, and take heed, there may be a falling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>way for all this; but I say as yet, God has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot lost thee, as yet he has not cast thee off, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Heb.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 1 <HI>to</HI> 8.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="003637_0073_10023A9EE922DA70"/><HI>Secondly,</HI> With respect to thy Desires what are they? Wouldst thou be saved? Would'st thou be saved with a thoro' Sal∣vation? Would'st thou be saved from Guilt and Filth too? Would'st thou be the Ser∣vant of thy Saviour? Art thou indeed weary of the Service of thy old Master the the Devil, Sin and the World? And has these Desires put thy Soul to the Flight? Hast thou thro' Desires betaken thy self to thy Heels? Dost fly to him that is as a Sa∣viour from the Wrath to come, for Life? If these be thy Desires, and if they be un∣feigned, fear not: Thou art one of those <HI>Run-aways</HI> which God hath commanded our Lord to receive, and not to send thee back to the Devil thy Master again, but to give thee a Place in his House, even the Place in his House, which liketh the best. <HI>Thou shalt not deliver to his Master,</HI> says he, <HI>the Servant which escaped from his Master unto thee. He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that Place which he shall chuse, in one of thy Gates where it liketh him best, thou shalt not oppress him,</HI> Deut. 23.15, 16.</P>
<P>This is a Command to the Church, con∣sequently to the Head of the Church, for all Commands from God come to her thro' her Head. Whence I conclude, that as <HI>Is∣rael</HI> of old was to receive the run-away Servant, who escaped from a neathe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ster to them; and should not dare to ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> him
<PB N="141" REF="003637_0073_10023A9EE922DA70"/>
back to his Master again: So Christ's Church now, and consequently Christ him∣self, may not, will not refuse that Soul that hath made his Escape from Sin, Satan, the World and Hell unto him; but cer∣tainly let him dwell in his House among his Saints, in that Place which he shall chuse even where it liketh him best: For he say in another Place, <HI>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> In no wise, let his Crimes be what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey will, either for Nature, Multitude, or the Attendance of aggravating Cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P>Wherefore if thy Desires be firm, sound, unfeigned, to become he saved of Christ, and his Servant: Fear not, he will not, he will in no wise put thee away, or turn thee over to thy old Master again.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> As to thy Fears, whatsoever they are, let that be supposed which is supposed before, and they are groundless, and so of no weight.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But I am afraid I am not elect or chosen to Salvation, tho' you called me Fool a little before, for so fearing.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> Tho' Election is in order before calling, as to God, yet the Knowledge of Calling must go before the Belief of my Election, as to my self; wherefore Souls that doubt of the Truth of their effectual Calling, do but plunge them∣selves
<PB N="142" REF="003637_0074_10023AC2A2A4D5E0"/>
into a deeper Labrynith of Confu∣sion, that concern themselves with their Election, I mean while they labour to know it before they prove their Caning. <HI>Make your ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling,</HI> and so your Electi∣on sure, 2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.4 <HI>to</HI> 10.</P>
<P>Wherefore at presen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, lay the Thoughts of thy Election by, and ask <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these Questions: Do I see my lost Condition? Do I see Salvation is no where but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Christ? Would I share in this Salvat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n by Faith of him? And would I, as was said afore, be thoroughly saved, <HI>to wit,</HI> from the Filth, as well as from the Guilt? Do I love Christ, his Father, his Saints, his Word and Ways? This is the Way to prove we are Elect. Wherefore Sin∣ner, when Satan or thine own Heart seek to puzzle thee with Election, say thou, I cannot tend to talk of this Point now, but stay till I know that I am called of God to the Fellowship of his Son, and then I shall shew you that I am Elect, and that my Name is written in the Book of Life.</P>
<P>If poor distressed Souls would observe this Order, they might save themselves the trouble of an unprofitable Labour, under these unreasonable and Soul-sink∣ing Doubts.</P>
<P>Let us therefore, upon the sight of our Wretchedness, fly and venturously leap
<PB N="143" REF="003637_0074_10023AC2A2A4D5E0"/>
into the Arms of Christ, which are now as open to receive us into his Bosom, as they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e when nailed to the Cross. This is coming to Christ for Life aright; this is right running away from thy Mas∣ter to him, as was said before. And for this we have multitudes of Scriptures to support, incourage, and comfort us in our so doing.</P>
<P>But now let him that doth thus be sure to look for it, for Satan will be with him to Morrow, to see if he can get him again to his old Service, and if he cannot do that, then will he enter into Dispute with him, <HI>to wit,</HI> About whether he be elect to Life, and called indeed to partake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Christ, to whom he is fled for S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣cour; or whether he comes to him of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own presumptuous Mind: Therefore w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are bid, as to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me, so to arm our selves with that Arm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur which God hath pro∣vided▪ that we may resist, quench, stand against, and withstand all the fiery Darts of the Devil. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.11 <HI>to</HI> 18.</P>
<P>I therefore thou findest Satan in this Order to march against thee, remember that thou hadst this <HI>Item</HI> about it; and betake thy self to Faith and good Cou∣rage▪ and be sober and hope to the End.</P>
<P><HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ct.</HI> But how if I should have sinned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n unpardonable, or that Sin against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oly Ghost.</P>

No Man can hope for Redemp∣tion by that Blood which he yet count∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> an unholy Thing.

<P>Tis true, Words and Wars, and Blas∣phemies against this Son of Man are par∣donable; but then they must be done ig∣norantly, and in Unbelief.
