<P>Up, sanctify the People, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sanctify yourselves against To-morrow: For thus saith the LORD GOD of <HI>Israel.</HI> There is an accursed Thing in the Midst of thee, O <HI>Israel</HI>: Thou canst not stand before thine Enemies, until ye take away the accursed Thing from among you.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Chapter, we have an Account of <HI>Joshua</HI>'s sending Spies to the Country of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> with the Report they made at their Return:—The Number of Men he sent to destroy that petty Kingdom:—That they fled before their Enemies, and some of them were slain.</P>
<P>We are in the next Place informed of the Behaviour of <HI>Joshua,</HI> and the <HI>Elders</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> upon this Occasion: They humbled themselves before God, 6 ver. <HI>For the Heart of all the People <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and became as Water,</HI> upon their hearing the News; and <HI>Joshua</HI> himself was greatly alarm'd.—But the same Day at Evening they had an Answer from God, in which <HI>Joshua</HI> was directed what Method to take, in order to find out the guilty Person, who had, by his Theft, procured the Defeat,—The Kind and Degree of his Punishment was likewise specified by the Divine Oracle at the same Time; which was executed the next Day, in the Manner prescribed, after he had been detected and convicted, 24, 25 ver. <HI>And they raised a great Heap of Stones over him,</HI> as a Monument of God's righteous Dis∣pleasure and Severity against Sins of such a public Scandal and general Mischief to the Community, and as a Warning to all others.</P>
<P>And this was wisely order'd by God in the Beginning of their new Em∣pire and Settlement in the promised Land, to prevent the Death of great Numbers, that took Warning by this awful Example; who, if not re∣strained by the Fear and Love of God, from such detestable and destructive
<PB N="4" REF="007583_0004_102D7F40AEF52DE0"/>
Practices, yet, would be, by the Fear of Punishment, and the Love of their own, and their dear Childrens Lives.</P>
<P>I shall wave a particular and critical Survey of the Context, which would take up much Time to little Purpose, and proceed to the Text; in which it may be noted, That God speaks to <HI>Joshua</HI> with great Solemnity, and Indications of high Displeasure: <HI>Up, sanctify the People, and say, Sanctify yourselves</HI>—"Rise from your Prostration—Attend the Duty incumbent on you—Put the People upon making suitable Preparation to appear be∣fore God—Summon them to be ready against To-morrow, and bid them see that they have no ceremonial Pollution upon them, but purify your∣selves from whatever is contrary to the Law in this Case, that I may point out, before the whole Congregation, the Person that has committed the accursed Fact; and that you may all see his most awful and exemplary Punishment.—Purify yourselves, for the whole Congregation is, in some Respect, polluted by this detestable Thing."</P>
<P>The latter Part of the Text contains a Declaration of the Reason, why the Army that was sent out could not stand, and the Necessity of their removing the Cause, in order to their being able, for the future, to stand before, and subdue their Enemies: <HI>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, There is an accursed Thing in the Midst of thee, O</HI> Israel: <HI>Thou canst not stand before thine Enemies, until ye take away the accursed Thing from among you.</HI> The Sin of <HI>Achan,</HI> considered in all its Circumstances, had put the whole People of <HI>Israel</HI> out of the Divine Protection, and was the Cause of God's with∣drawing from them that Spirit of Courage and Resolution, which are ne∣cessary in War. When that is withheld, no Warriors, tho' their natural Courage and acquired Skill be ever so great, can stand before the most contemptible Foe; especially when it is on the Account of the Violation of their Covenant-Engagements; which was then the Case of the <HI>Israelites.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now attempt, by Divine Assistance, to offer something agreeable to the Subject, under the following general Heads.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. When God's professing People go forth to war against their Enemies, they should be very careful to put away from among them, all their Sins; especially that, which is emphatically, <HI>The accursed Thing in the Midst of them.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. In order to this, a diligent Inquiry ought to be made, to find out what it is.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. The Reason assigned for this Duty is, <HI>That unless it be taken away, they cannot stand before their Enemies in the Day of Battle.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="5" REF="007583_0005_102D7F424124CD08"/>IV. A particular Application shall conclude the Subject.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. When God's professing People go forth to war against their Enemies, they should be very careful to put away from among them all their Sins; especially that, which is emphatically, <HI>The Accursed Thing in the Midst of them.</HI></P>
<P>That this Duty is <HI>more especially</HI> incumbent on those who are favour'd with the Light of the Gospel, I need not attempt to prove to a Christian Auditory. And that God's peculiar People are often obliged, by the ill Treatment of some of their fellow Men, to go to war with them in a Way of Self-defence (which is a Duty they owe to Him, as the Author of their Being) is evident from undeniable Facts: Otherwise they would be driven out of the World by Violence; not called out by the ordinary Way of Providence; or be forced to drag out the most miserable Lives, in the most abject Slavery, without tasting the Sweetness of <HI>Liberty,</HI> which is common to the <HI>Human Species.</HI> And that <HI>defensive</HI> War is frequently ne∣cessary as well as lawful, and <HI>offensive</HI> War sometimes so, is conspicuous, not only from the Oracles of Truth, but even from the Principles of Na∣ture in its degenerate State. In the Old Testament, we have diverse Ac∣counts of its being undertaken and engaged in, by the special Appointment and Command of the Lord of Hosts. Nor is it any where forbidden in the New Testament, either by Christ, the Prince of Peace, who constituted and presided over the legal, as well as the evangelical Dispensation, or by his Apostles; but is implicitly approved of by them: Which it would not have been, if it had been contrary to the Spirit of the Gospel, but would have been forbidden by them.</P>
<P>This being so evident, I shall not attempt a Vindication of it against Sophisters and Bigots; especially as this interesting, tho' in itself, unplea∣sant Subject, has, of late Years, been set in the most convincing Light by the clearest Pens <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI>'s and Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Sermons (of <HI>Philadelphia</HI>) on the Subject. And Mr. <HI>William Currie</HI>'s Vindication of the Lawfulness of de∣fensive War; printed in <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Having premised these Things, we come to the Point, which is, That when the Lord's People go to war, they ought to put away all their Sins, especially that which is the Accursed Thing. The Obligation is general and binding upon all Persons, at all Times, in all Circumstances, more especially when under the Rebukes and Frowns of Providence for their
<PB N="6" REF="007583_0006_102D7F441B24D270"/>
Sins, as they are in a Time of War. This Dispensation is a solemn Call to the Practice of the Duty, which ought to be religiously observed, especially when there is any Thing particularly specified, as there was in the Case of the <HI>Jews</HI> at their Entrance into the Land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> The revealed Will of God is the only Rule of our Conduct, and his Authority the Rea∣son of our Compliance.</P>
<P>Now, by the Accursed Thing, we are to understand the Person of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an,</HI> together with his stolen Goods, as in 12 ver. And his taking these was Sacrilege, because consecrated to the Lord▪ <HI>Josh.</HI> 6 19.</P>
<P>But if it be demanded, What <HI>we,</HI> at this Day, are to understand by the Accursed Thing? How it may be taken away? And who shall undertake the difficult Task?</P>
<P>The Answer to the first of these Inquiries is, That we are to understand Sin in general, especially that which is open and public; or those Sins which are openly committed by Persons of Note, and by Men in Authority and Office, both Civil and Ecclesiastical: And those which are committed by the Encouragement, Approbation, and Connivance of dignified Per∣sons. There is an intrinsic moral Evil in <HI>all</HI> Sin, especially the last Sort, as contrary to the most holy Nature and Law of God: For this Reason, every Sin is an Accursed Thing. For, as the Apostle argues, <HI>Sin is the Transgression of the Law</HI>; of that Law, which is a Transcript of the moral Perfections of God; therefore necessarily <HI>holy, just, and good.</HI> And every Sin is more or less heinous, as Cases and Circumstances vary, or may be alter'd for special, prudential, or public Reasons. <HI>That Sin,</HI> therefore, which is the most detrimental to the public Good, and the most dishonorary to God, is <HI>now,</HI> and <HI>ever,</HI> to be deem'd the Accursed Thing.</P>
<P>The next Inquiry is, How this is to be taken away?</P>
<P>The Answer is easy, but the Performance difficult: But it may be done by a vigorous and faithful Execution of the Laws of the Country; which is the Magistrate's Province. And it supposes him to be concerned only in such Things as properly come under his Cognizance. For where the legislative Body provide a Sect of good Laws, enforcing the Observation of the Divine; there the wanton Boughs and rampant Branches may be cut off, tho' the Trunk of the Tree remain, and the Root live. For, pub∣lic Sins are but overgrown Branches of the accursed Root of corrupt Na∣ture, which shoot out to more open View. And 'tis evident from known Facts, that these in general may be lop'd off by a vigorous and faithful
<PB N="7" REF="007583_0007_102D7F45F1A3B7C8"/>
Exertion of civil Power and Authority. For the <HI>Magistracy</HI> was erected among Mankind in their degenerate State, and these Powers were ordain'd by God, for this very End. <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.1. <HI>Let every Soul be subject unto the higher Powers. For there is no Power but of God: The Powers that be, are ordain'd of God. Whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Or∣dinance of God. For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works, but to evil.</HI></P>
<P>It follows then, in Answer to the last Inquiry, that this Work belongs to the Magistrate; who, as by his Office, he undertakes it, so he is obliged, in Point of Duty to God and the Public, to engage in it, otherwise <HI>be bears the Sword in vain.</HI> He ought to do all that in him lies to suppress whatever Vice and Immortality is cognizable by the Law: This is greatly conducive to the Benefit of Society. <HI>For,</HI> continues the Apostle, 4 ver▪ <HI>he is the Minister of God for Good to thee</HI> (if thou do that which is good) <HI>But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vain: For he is the Minister of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI> The civil Magistrate may do much toward a Reformation, by suppressing Vice, if he would dare to magnify his Office, by a vigilant and faithful Discharge of it. When this is not wanting on his Part, all needed Assistance, and a Blessing, never sail on God's Part. This might be exemplified by Instances both from sacred and profane History; but I shall only recur to our Text and Context for Illustration. Here we find <HI>Joshua,</HI> as a <HI>Judge</HI> and <HI>Magistrate,</HI> and as <HI>Generalissimo</HI> of all the <HI>Jewish</HI> Forces, expresly commanded by God to search out and punish <HI>the Accursed Thing</HI>: Which done, God went forth with their Armies and enabled them to stand before their Enemies. This Event seems in general to be adapted to all Persons in high Stations, and to have been designed for an Example to them. And that Nation that is favour'd with good Laws (such as secure the Persons, Privileges, and Properties of the Subject) and with faithful Magistrates, of a generous public Spirit, may be styled <HI>Righteous,</HI> in a forensic Sense, agreeable to the Divine Aphorism, <HI>Prov.</HI> 14.34. <HI>Righteousness,</HI> encouraged, promoted, and protected, <HI>exalteth a Nation: But Sin,</HI> countenanced, and unpunished by civil Authority, <HI>is a Reproach to any People.</HI></P>
<P>When therefore the Rulers of a professing People send forth their Armies to war, they should not only be satisfied that the <HI>Cause</HI> be just, but take a religious Care to remove every Thing, especially the <HI>Accursed,</HI> from among them, that there may be no Obstacle in the Way of their Success.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007583_0008_102D7F47DE4753D8"/>Nor are <HI>Generals</HI> or <HI>Admirals,</HI> or any subordinate Officers, exempted from the Duty; but should do their Endeavour, as far as their Observation, Authority, and Influence, can extend, to put away Iniquity from among <HI>themselves</HI> and their Men. And all that are in Authority, both civil and ecclesiastical, especially <HI>the Preachers of Righteousness,</HI> ought daily, and forever to recommend and enforce the Observation of our salutary Laws, by their <HI>own Example,</HI> and by a steady, uniform Practice of those Things, which they require by Law, and recommend by Precept and Doctrine: Otherwise the Law loses its Force, Government misses its End, and Preach∣ing is unprofitable. For the Glory of God, and the Good of the Public, require them to shine as Lights in the Midst of a perverse and crooked Generation.</P>
<P>In a Word; when the <HI>common Soldiers</HI> and <HI>Marines</HI> are engaged in War, they should carefully put away the unclean Thing; and so should they that <HI>abide by the Stuff,</HI> and they that remain in their Possessions. Hear with practical Reverence, what God says in this very Case: <HI>Deut.</HI> 23.9. <HI>When the Host goeth forth against thine Enemies, then keep thee from every wicked Thing. For the Lord thy God walketh in the Midst of thy Camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine Enemies before thee. Therefore shall thy Camp be holy, that he see no unclean Thing in thee, and turn away from thee.</HI></P>
<P>Having dispatch'd the first, we proceed to the next general Head.</P>
<P N="2">II. In order to the Removal of <HI>the accursed Thing,</HI> a diligent Inquiry ought to be made, to find out what it is.</P>
<P>Take away the Cause and the Effects will cease. In order to this, we must use such Means as are adapted to the End.—We must exercise our Faculties as reasonable Creatures.—Must consider our Ways, and observe the Ways of others, estimating the latter by Facts and clear Evidences, not by mere Suspicions.—We must <HI>search and try our Ways</HI>; reflect upon our∣selves and Conduct; inspect our Hearts very minutely; and examine our Actions very accurately, by the Divine Rule.—We must learn the Art of <HI>Self-Knowledge</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See an excellent small Treatise on this Subject by <HI>John Mason, A. M.</HI> which ought to be read by every one who is capable of <HI>Self-Application.</HI></NOTE>; which Kind of Knowledge is, in general, the least re∣garded and inquired after of many, tho' of all other the most necessary and useful to Mankind, with Respect both to their present and future Happiness. Every one ought to learn what are his own reigning Vices;
<PB N="9" REF="007583_0009_102D7F49B7A9C568"/>
and they that are in public Offices, ought to acquaint themselves with the prevailing Vices of the Times, in order to expose and restrain them as much as possible.</P>
<P>We need not enter into a Detail of Particulars, to inform those that are in Office, what Method they ought to take, and what Means to use, in order to detect and restrain Vice and Immorality: If they know what belongs to their Office, they know the Means; and if so, they are inex∣cusable, if they use them not, in the Sight of the Great LAW-GIVER and JUDGE of all, to whom they will one Day find themselves ac∣countable for all their Conduct and Procedure, both in the <HI>Legislative</HI> and <HI>Executive</HI> Trust. To whom does it belong, but to the Magistrate, to search out, and take away open and public Sins? Is he not styled in Scripture, <HI>The Minister of God,</HI> for this End? <HI>Thus</HI> he is to sanctify the People;— and they also must sanctify themselves, <HI>by considering their Ways, and framing their Doings, to turn unto their God.</HI> In doing which, both Ma∣gistrates and People must use the Means conducive to the End, or they will fail of the desired Success. But, let it be noted, that the Sanctification here mentioned, is only legal and external, and will not avail to the Sal∣vation of the Soul, without the internal Sanctification of the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>We proceed to the next Proposition.</P>
<P N="3">III. To assign the Reason of the Duty; which is, That unless God's People take away the accursed Thing from among them, they cannot stand before their Enemies in Battle.</P>
<P>For the Evincing of this Point, let us consider the Nature of Sin in general; the defiling Influence of it upon Mankind; and the destructive Tendency and Consequence of it.</P>
<P>As to the Nature of Sin, it is described by an Apostle to be, <HI>The Trans∣gression of the Law of God</HI>: Which Law is a Transcript of his moral Per∣fections; therefore necessarily <HI>holy, just, and good.</HI> The intrinsic Turpitude of Sin, as contrary to the Purity of the Divine Nature and Law, is the prin∣cipal Reason why it should be put away.</P>
<P>And it has a defiling Influence upon Men, and renders those who are guilty of it, vile and filthy in the Sight of that God, <HI>who is of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity,</HI> without infinite Detestation, at any Time, or in any Place, especially in a Time of War, and a critical Conjuncture of Affairs. Therefore it should be put away from the Courts and Palaces of Kings and Princes; from national Councils, and the higher Courts; and from all the
<PB N="10" REF="007583_0010_102D7F4B99D8BEB8"/>
Courts of Judicature in the Nation and Kingdom, of every Denomination; from the Markets, and all Places of public Commerce and Resort; and from our Camps, and Fleets, and Fortresses: For it is most heinous, when practised openly by Persons in high Stations, public Offices, and impor∣tant Trusts, who should be the most virtuous and exemplary Persons in the World, on Account of the Influence which their Example has upon others.</P>
<P>As to the Tendency and Consequence of public Sins, it is to bring De∣solation and Ruin upon the People, as is evident from the History of the Kings of <HI>Israel.</HI>—For when the Holy ONE of <HI>Israel</HI> looks down upon a People, and sees the abominable Thing among them, he turns away with Indignation, and withdraws his favourable Presence and kind Influence.— Then follows Confusion, and endless perplexing Debates in their Coun∣cils, Frustration of their Schemes, Disappointment of their Enterprizes, and Defeat of their Armies, with a <HI>Series</HI> of other Judgments and Cala∣mities.</P>
<P>And <HI>now</HI> they cannot <HI>Stand</HI> before their Enemies; but are surprized, intimidated, run, stumble, and fall down dead and wounded in Heaps— Just like a Flock of the feather'd Kind, that were stretching their Course, secure, over Hills and Mountains, Vallies and Rivers, till they advanced near the Place, where the Fowler lay in Ambush, amongst the Reeds;— then, upon his sudden and unexpected Discharge, fall to the Ground, flutter and expire,—while some escape affrighted, and others wounded.— And no Wonder they cannot <HI>stand</HI>—for God has departed from them, and left them an easy Prey to their Enemies. And as He is not for them, He is against them, and on the Side of their Adversaries. And tho' their Number be ever so great, and their Military Preparations, Courage, and Skill for War, ever so respectable; yet if God be not for them, and with them, as their wise LEADER and almighty PROTECTOR, they cannot <HI>stand</HI>—Read with Reverence the awful apposite Threatening, <HI>Lev.</HI> 26.15. <HI>If ye will not do all my Commandments, but break my Covenant—I will set my Face against you, and ye shall be stain before your Enemies. They that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.</HI> The Lord of Hosts cannot go forth with our Armies to fight our Battles for us, cannot walk in our Camp to deliver us, when his infinitely holy and penetrating Eyes behold the Accursed Thing in the Midst of us. <HI>How can two walk together, except they be agreed?—What Concord hath</HI> CHRIST <HI>with</HI> Belial?— For this very important Reason, we should <HI>carefully</HI> take away <HI>Every Ac∣cursed Thing,</HI> when our Armies go out to war.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="007583_0011_102D7F4D5B1AB498"/>We are now come to the last Part design'd in the Method; which is,</P>
<P N="4">IV. A particular Application of the Subject in several Uses. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us humble ourselves under the mighty Hand of God, that has been stretch'd out against us, in the late Defeat of our principal Army.</P>
<P>This is a heavy Blow, justly inflicted upon us by the Hand of an angry God—a terrible Evil in itself; but may however, by his wise and good Providence, prove beneficial in the End. And we <HI>ought</HI> to know that it is for our Sins, highly aggravated, long and obstinately persisted in, after solemn Warnings, and sharp Rebukes, of various Kinds. Let us then justify God and take Shame to ourselves, like the penitent <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Ezra</HI>'s Time. <HI>Thou art righteous, O Lord God; for we remain yet escaped, as at this Day. Behold we are before Thee in our Trespasses: For we cannot stand before Thee because of this.</HI> If we cannot stand before our Enemies in this World, because of our Sins; how much less shall we be able to stand be∣fore the just JUDGE in the great Day, if they are not pardon'd thro' the Blood of Christ!</P>
<P N="2">2. The next Use shall be of Information and Examination concerning the <HI>Accursed Thing,</HI> that has procur'd this Defeat.</P>
<P>That the World of Mankind is totally corrupt, I need not inform you:— But that Vice and Immorality, Error and Heresy, prevail more than ever, I must tell you: Let the Reader's own <HI>Observation</HI> and <HI>Conscience</HI> be my Witnesses—<HI>Conscience,</HI> that Candle of the Lord, that Lamp of Heaven, which lightens every Man that comes into the World; and which cannot be extiguished, till Man almost wholly degenerates from the State of his Creation.</P>
<P>If any should be inquisitive to know, What is <HI>the particular Accursed Thing,</HI> in the Case of <HI>New-England,</HI> which, above all other, may be justly supposed to be the Cause provoking God to fight against us, and permit the Enemy to defeat our Army?—I must say, in Answer to this pertinent Query, That there are so many Accursed Things among us, that I have been almost at a Loss which to single out:—However, I will mention some of them, and leave the Reader to chuse and judge for himself, re∣serving to myself the Liberty of <HI>shewing my own Opinion.</HI></P>
<P>The abominable accursed Things that prevail in our Nation and Land, among all <HI>Orders, Ranks,</HI> and <HI>Sexes</HI> of Persons, especially in the Sea-port Towns, are such as these, <HI>viz.</HI> Customary profane Swearing and Cursing (taking Gods Name in vain, and imprecating Divine Vengeance upon
<PB N="12" REF="007583_0012_102D7F4F60F410D0"/>
Persons and Things) as if simple Affirmations and Negations had no Weight, without this harsh accursed Adjunct; or as if the native Flowers of Rhetoric, and a graceful modest Address, were unornamental, unless intermixt and garnished with shocking Expressions of Impiety;—as tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Politeness could not consist with a proper Regard to the DEITY; and this <HI>polite</HI> and <HI>wise</HI> Age could relish no Conversation, but that which is offensive to Him!—But <HI>polite,</HI> only in the Esteem of Persons of a deprav'd Taste, degenerate Minds, and dissolute Morals; and <HI>wise,</HI> only among <HI>Fools</HI>!—Another Evil is, the open Profanation of the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> by unnecessary Pursuit of Business, and by drolling it away in Pastime and Merriment, either in public Houses, or open Streets;—Contempt and Neglect of the Gospel, its Ordinances and Institutions;—professed Infidelity, and prevail∣ing Heresy:—Pride and Arrogance:—Gluttony and Drunkenness (the Abuse of Meats and Drinks in a greater or less Degree) whereby the Fa∣culties of the Soul, and Organs of the Body, are not only clogged and impeded in their several Acts and Functions, but even imbruted, and un∣fitted for any Service, either human or divine:—Extravagant and immo∣dest Apparel among that Sex, that pretends to the greatest Modesty:— Fraud, Injustice, and Oppression in Bargains, Dealings and Commerce, and the pernicious Practice of <HI>Clandestine Trading</HI> in a Time of War:— Extortion of Usurers, more especially the detestable Crime of Bribery, and Partiality in Courts of Judicature, and general Assembles; whereby it comes to pass, that <HI>the Righteous are rewarded according to the Work of the Wicked, and the Wicked according to the Work of the Righteous,</HI> as the Prophet complains:—Defamation, Slander and Mischief-making among Neighbours and Friends; especially Falsifying in Witness-bearing:— Coveteousness, Theft, and Sacrilege, which was the Sin of <HI>Achan</HI> — And lastly, <HI>Self-Confidence</HI> in War, at this <HI>critical Conjuncture,</HI> when our <HI>ALL</HI> lies at Stake.—These Things, and many more, which might have been bro't into the Account, have been very observable among us for many Years, especially of late:—Let Conscience speak, and the Guilty shall be convinced.</P>
<P>And now, if there be one Sin rather than another, that may be pitch'd upon, as being the most considerable procuring Cause of the late sad Dis∣aster, I take it to be <HI>Self-Confidence in War</HI>: This, added to all our other flagrant Crimes, and public Sins, seems to have <HI>fill'd up</HI> our Measure, and <HI>ripen'd</HI> us for the Melancholy Event.—Did not a Self-confident Spirit begin
<PB N="13" REF="007583_0013_102D7F5155EB3C90"/>
to act, while we were preparing to send out our Armies? Did it not run thro' the Country, like Wild-fire, all the Time the <HI>General</HI> was on his March to <HI>Ohio?</HI> Did it not enflame every Fancy, and catch from Heart to Heart, and kindle up some unhallow'd Sparks even in pious Breasts? Alas, that there was so much of this accursed Thing to be seen, where better Things might have been expected!—Did we rightly consider <HI>JEHOVAH,</HI> as the LORD of <HI>Sabaoth,</HI> or the Armies of his People?—That <HI>the Battle is his,</HI> and that he has an indubitable Right to <HI>give it to whomsoever he pleaseth?</HI> And to compleat the presumptuous Scene, did not our Troops go out to war, <HI>boasting</HI> in themselves, as if they were not just <HI>putting on the Harness,</HI> but were <HI>putting it off?</HI> And had we not several Accounts of the Prevalence of the same Spirit among them, while on their March? Does it not then appear, that <HI>Self-Confidence in War</HI> is the <HI>Accursed Thing,</HI> that prevented their <HI>standing before their Enemies?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. We hence learn, that Self-Confidence in War is, in its Nature, most offensive to the Lord of Hosts.</P>
<P>This is a complicate Vice of the Mind, and of an Atheistical Complexion: It militates audaciously and presumptuously against the Being and Attri∣butes of God; particularly his <HI>Wisdom,</HI> in setting up finite Wisdom against that which is infinite, which alone knows how to govern the World, and dispose of all Events, infinitely better than the best Politicians.— Against His <HI>Power,</HI> by boasting in their own Strength, forgetful of the ALMIGHTY; trusting in their Numbers, in their Military Skill and Fur∣niture; in the Bravery of their Generals and Admirals, and of their Officers and Men (all which are at best but an Arm of Flesh) whereby they do practically, and in a Sense, explicitly, deny the ALMIGHTY, and their absolute Dependence upon Him; as if they, thus equip'd by Human Art, had no Need of Him to <HI>teach their Hands to war, and their Fingers to fight; and to cover their Heads in the Day of Battle:</HI> Or to be their <HI>Sun, to en∣lighten them in their Way, and their Shield to defend them in their Battles:</HI> And as tho' they had it in their Power, to command Success and Victory by their own conquering Blows.—It is also an Impeachment of the <HI>Justice</HI> of God, if he should not give them the Victory; allowing they are de∣pendent on Him therefor.—And, in a Word, it is a setting up their Wills against the Divine <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> and denying Him the sole Prerogative of ordering all Events, as he pleaseth; particularly those relating to guilty Mortals, unworthy of any gracious Notice. It is a determining in them∣selves,
<PB N="14" REF="007583_0014_102D7F52F46EC290"/>
and proudly declaring, That they <HI>will</HI> have the Victory, whether <HI>He</HI> will give it, or not: And so by Consequence, setting up themselves, not only against God, but above God.</P>
<P><HI>This,</HI> as it is the most shocking Thought, so it is the most ready Way to procure such a <HI>remarkable Defeat,</HI> as our Army has lately had.—Thus I have given you a general View of the Nature of Self-Confidence in War, <HI>the Accursed Thing,</HI> which, <HI>above all other,</HI> or in <HI>Addition to many other,</HI> public Sins, has provoked God to inflict this humbling Stroke.—Let as many of us then, as are conscious of <HI>this Sin</HI> (and who among us is not guilty?) smite upon our Breasts, saying,—"Alas, my Soul, how great a Share hast thou had in procuring this Calamity!"</P>
<P N="4">4. We infer likewise, that it becomes us to be modest and cautious in our Remarks upon this Occasion.</P>
<P>People are very apt to make unsuitable Remarks upon such Occasions.— While some find Fault with the Great FIRST CAUSE, and blame the Conduct of his Providence;—others lay the Blame of adverse Events upon <HI>Second Causes,</HI> in such a Manner, as if there was no <HI>First Mover,</HI> and <HI>Sovereign Disposer</HI> of Events; but as tho' all depended upon human Foresight, Prudence, and Bravery.</P>
<P>As to the Conduct of Divine Providence towards us, and the Equity of it, in the late Defeat, it has been sufficiently vindicated in the preceding Discourse, by the Consideration of our <HI>Sinfulness</HI> and <HI>Unworthiness.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>General,</HI> he was a brave experienc'd Warrior, in the <HI>Regular Way,</HI> who had, by his good Behaviour in Military Affairs, deserved well of his King and Country;—and was in high Favour with those who knew his Abilities:—His Merit recommended him to his Majesty's Service in <HI>America.</HI>—But he had not Opportunity to acquaint himself with the <HI>Irregu∣lar Manner</HI> of Fighting in this Country—And so he happen'd to be un∣fortunate.—</P>
<P>When he fell into Difficulty and Danger, he exerted himself to the ut∣most;—and when the Case requir'd it, exposed himself as much as if he had been a common Soldier, rather than desert our Cause, or save himself by an inglorious Flight.—And his Example was follow'd by the Officers, who, 'tis said, behav'd in the most gallant Manner; tho' they also were unacquainted with the <HI>American</HI> Way of Fighting.</P>
<P>The Means of this Defeat were ordain'd and order'd by God: The procuring Cause was our Sins, especially the <HI>Accursed Thing.</HI> We, by our
<PB N="15" REF="007583_0015_102D7F55559D3FB8"/>
Sins, by our <HI>Self-Confidence,</HI> together with <HI>that</HI> which prevail'd in the Army, rendered him unable to stand before our Enemies.</P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P N="5">5. Let us take up a Lamentation over our fallen General; and over our degenerate Land.</P>
<P>"How are the mighty fallen, and the Weapons of War perished! Tell it not at <HI>Quebec,</HI> publish it not in the Streets of <HI>Paris,</HI> lest the Daughters of <HI>France</HI> rejoice, and the Sons of <HI>Anti-christ</HI> triumph. Ye Mountains of <HI>Apalachea,</HI> and ye Plains of <HI>Ohio,</HI> let there be no Dew, neither let there be Rain upon you—And thou <HI>Monongahela</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Monongahela</HI>—a River, about a Quarter of a Mile wide, near Fort <HI>Du Quesne,</HI> fordable in Summer; near to which the Battle was fought.</NOTE>, let not thy Waters, stain'd with the Blood of <HI>British</HI> Warriors, henceforth flow, to regale and fer∣tilise thy fatal Banks—For <HI>There</HI> the Shield of the Mighty is vively cast∣away, the Shield of BRADDOCK, as tho' he had not been a mighty Man. From the Slaughter of the Mighty, the Sword of <HI>Braddock</HI> turned not back, nor returned empty. Ye Daughters of the <HI>English Israel,</HI> weep over <HI>Braddock</HI>; who, had not your Sins prevented him from being victorious, would have cloathed you in Scarlet, with other Delights, and would have put on Ornaments of Gold upon your Apparel. How are the Mighty fallen in the Midst of the Battle! <HI>O Braddock,</HI> thou wast slain in our low Places by the cowardly Foe, lurking among the Reeds, afraid to meet <HI>Thee</HI> on equal Ground. We are distressed for thee, dear <HI>Braddock</HI>—Very pleasant hast thou been unto us: Alas, that it was for so short a Time! How are the Mighty fallen! How are the Weapons of War perished!"</P>
<P>And <HI>Thou, New-England</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By <HI>New-England,</HI> some understand all the <HI>British</HI> Colonies in <HI>North-America;</HI> others only a Part.</NOTE>, <HI>How</HI> art thou <HI>fallen from thy first Love—and from thy first Works!—Thou wast planted a noble Vine, and wholly a right Seed: How then art thou turned into the degenerate Plant of a strange Vine!</HI> How is thy Excellence departed from thee, and thy Glory sullied!—Thou wast once an <HI>Asylum</HI> of persecuted Saints; but thou art now almost con∣verted into a <HI>Den of Thieves and Robbers.</HI> Thou hast forsaken thy God, and he has departed from <HI>Thee</HI> in many Respects:—Wo to thee, if he should wholly depart from thee!—Thy Name is changed to <HI>Ichabod, i. e.</HI> the Glory departed. Where is the Glory and Beauty that once distinguish'd
<PB N="16" REF="007583_0016_102D7F574D7CB688"/>
thee from others?—Tho' thou wast once possess'd of <HI>Virgin</HI>-Charms and Innocence, thou hast since <HI>followed many Lovers,</HI> and hast degenerated into a shameless Prostitute to numberless debasing Lusts, whereby thou art ex∣posed to the severe Resentments of thy Maker <HI>once</HI> thy Husband; but <HI>now no more,</HI> till thou returnest to the Exercise of thy <HI>first Love.—How</HI> have thy Sins <HI>divorced</HI> thee from Him! And <HI>how often</HI> has he threaten'd to <HI>cast Thee out</HI> of his <HI>House,</HI> and <HI>out</HI> of the <HI>good Land,</HI> which he gave your Fore-fathers for a Possession!—<HI>How</HI> is thy Excellence, O <HI>New England,</HI> departed from thee! <HI>How is the Gold become dim, and the most fine Gold changed!</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. We advance now to an Argument of Excitation and Encouragement.</P>
<P>The <HI>Justice</HI> of our <HI>Cause</HI>—The <HI>Success</HI> already granted—The <HI>Prospect of Advantage</HI> to ourselves, and Posterity—And the <HI>Impossibility</HI> of living by such <HI>perfidicus. Blood thirsty</HI> Neighbours, as the <HI>French</HI> and their <HI>Allies</HI> in <HI>Ame∣rica</HI>—are <HI>powerful</HI> Motives to <HI>excite</HI> us, both to <HI>Caution,</HI> and to <HI>Action.</HI></P>
<P>That our <HI>Cause is just and good,</HI> has of late been prov'd by <HI>ancient au∣thentic Records,</HI> and <HI>Histories</HI> of Facts, both <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI>; and by the most solemn Treaties of <HI>Utrecht</HI> and <HI>Aix la Chapelle</HI>; the Conditions of which, have never yet been fulfill'd by the <HI>French</HI>;—and are never like to be, unless we compel them by Sword in Hand. 'Tis further evident, from their <HI>vast Encroachments</HI> upon our Lands, and the numerous Forts they have built thereon, to defend them, computed to be near <HI>fifty,</HI> great and small;—and from the <HI>execrable Barbarities</HI> committed by them and their <HI>Indians</HI> upon the Inhabitants, even in Times of Peace <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See a Pamphlet, entituled,</HI> The present State of NORTH AMERICA▪ Lond. <HI>printed.</HI> Bost. <HI>reprinted.</HI></NOTE>: These Things, and many other, which might be mention'd, make it evident, <HI>that our Cause is just and good.</HI></P>
<P>And, we may <HI>encourage</HI> ourselves to hope, notwithstanding the <HI>Ohio-Defeat,</HI> that the God of Armies is yet <HI>for us,</HI> and will <HI>still maintain</HI> our Cause, from the remarkable Smiles of his Providence upon us, with regard to the <HI>Successes</HI> granted our Forces at <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> and the Defeat of the <HI>French</HI> Army near Lake <HI>George</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This Sermon was printed after the Battle between General <HI>Johnson</HI> and Baron <HI>De Dieskou,</HI> which was fought <HI>Sept. 8. 1755;</HI> and some Things were added for Illustration.</NOTE>, which was a <HI>signal Victory</HI>; a never-to-be-forgotten-Mercy to the <HI>Englosh</HI> Colonies—and should excite us still to
<PB N="17" REF="007583_0017_102D7F590E0E7708"/>
<HI>encourage ourselves in the Lord,</HI> and to hope for his Protection and Blessing, <HI>in the right Use of proper Means,</HI> what are in our Power: For we have the Advantage of our Enemies in Point of Situation, Numbers, and Supplies of Necessaries for Life and War; which we ought thankfully and vigor∣ously to improve.</P>
<P>In so doing, we have a <HI>Prospect of rich Advantages</HI> to follow <HI>us,</HI> and our <HI>Children</HI> after us:—Such as the Recovery of our Rights and Properties, and the Lands of our <HI>American</HI> Allies, that have been ravish'd from them <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The present State of <HI>North-America.</HI></NOTE>; reducing the numerous Tribes of <HI>Indians</HI> to our Interest; se∣curing the valuable Furr-Trade to ourselves; with a vast Extent of Coun∣try, well water'd, and perhaps equal in <HI>Fertility</HI> to the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and naturally productive of every Thing useful in Life; and civilizing the <HI>Indians,</HI> in order to propagate the Gospel among them <HI>successfully,</HI> when these Followers of the <HI>Beast,</HI> these Sons of Violence and Falshood, are <HI>driven out</HI> of the Land; for they are the greatest Obstacle to the Success of the Gospel among them, except their own inherent Corruptions;—and what is more (and what every one that has a true Sense of Things, will fight, bleed, and die for, rather than resign or neglect) we have a Prospect of securing our <HI>invaluable spiritual Privileges,</HI> and of transmitting them inviolate to our latest Posterity.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Impossibility</HI> of living by such bad Neighbours as the <HI>French,</HI>— we may observe, That their repeated Practices give us sufficient Reason to conclude, they are of as bad a Disposition, as it is possible for human Creatures to be of, in this Life; and that they want nothing but <HI>Ability</HI> and <HI>Opportunity</HI> (which, blessed be God, has hitherto been withheld from them) to <HI>show</HI> the World how <HI>bad</HI> they are—They are not only a numerous, war-like Nation, whereby they are become respectable and formidable in <HI>Europe</HI>; but they are ambitious, enterprizing, subtile, deceitful, perfidious, and extremely cruel: And all this, under the amiable and attractive Ap∣pearance or Shew of Honesty, Pleasantry, Humanity, and Politeness; whereby they impose upon the <HI>English,</HI> who are more honest, by Educa∣tion, and of a better natural Disposition.—Their late Practice of <HI>burning, killing, torturing,</HI> and <HI>destroying,</HI> all they conquer in <HI>America,</HI> without Re∣gard to <HI>Age</HI> or <HI>Sex,</HI> is most shocking—<HI>Come,</HI> say they, <HI>let us cut them off from being a People; that the Name of</HI> New-England <HI>may be remembred no
<PB N="18" REF="007583_0018_102D7F5B0CB330B0"/>
more.</HI> What a <HI>cruel Design</HI> is this against vanquish'd Lives;—How <HI>alarm∣ing</HI> to those who have any Sparks of Humanity in their Disposition!—Or a Drop of <HI>English</HI> Blood in their Veins!—How <HI>abhorrent</HI> to every pious Soul!—How <HI>detestable</HI> to the kind and benevolent Author of our Beings!—</P>
<P>May it not then be expected, that the Consideration of these Things, which are known Facts, should awaken every Soul to <HI>strict Caution,</HI> and <HI>resolute Action,</HI> against <HI>such</HI> an Enemy?—If we fight, we can <HI>but</HI> die; if not, we are <HI>sure</HI> to die.—A sad <HI>Dilemma</HI> this, <HI>Fight, or Die!</HI> For the <HI>French</HI> seem determined, if possible, to root us quite out of <HI>America</HI>; and not only so, but to dispatch us out of the World; as if we were the most noxious Animals, and had not as good a Right to live upon God's Earth, and to breathe in his Air, as they have.—It is the Opinion of some, that they have <HI>private verbal</HI> Orders and Instructions, <HI>To give no Quarter to the</HI> English <HI>in</HI> America:—But whether they have, or not, their <HI>Practice</HI> is equally <HI>hurtful</HI> to us.—And shall we <HI>tamely suffer</HI> such intolerable Abuses? —Shall we <HI>lie down,</HI> like <HI>Lambs,</HI> to be slain, because they would have us? —Shall we not rather <HI>rouse,</HI> like <HI>Lions,</HI> and <HI>exert</HI> ourselves, like <HI>Men?</HI>—</P>
<P>To ARMS then—To ARMS, ye <HI>Descendants</HI> of ancient HEROES,— Ye <HI>Sons</HI> of Honor and Renown.—<HI>Rise, ye Fathers</HI> of your Country— Let every <HI>noble Principle,</HI> that <HI>resides</HI> in your Patriot-Breasts, <HI>awaken</HI> into <HI>new Life</HI> and <HI>Action, excited</HI> by the <HI>best Motives,</HI> and <HI>inspirited</HI> by the <HI>most glorious Cause,—Religion, Liberty, Self-defence.</HI> Let all your Faculties and Powers be <HI>employ'd,</HI> and every Drop of Blood in your Veins <HI>grow warm,</HI> and <HI>glow</HI> to a <HI>noble Ardor—Resent, Revenge,</HI> your Country's Wrongs.—<HI>Make</HI> it appear, that by the <HI>Help</HI> of God, and of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> you will bear their Insults and Cruelties no longer: That you can't endure to see your <HI>Wives</HI> (the dear Partners of your Joys and Sorrows) ravish'd before your Eyes, rip'd up with Child, and inhumanly murder'd;—nor your tender Babes (the lively Pledges of your mutual Loves) dash'd in Pieces against the Stones!—<HI>Horror to your Eyes!—Worse than Death to your Hearts!—More painful</HI> than the Sword, which (soon after the <HI>killing</HI> Sight) <HI>pierces your own Bowels!</HI>—And let them know, that you are not used to be driven into your Churches, and there burnt alive with your Wives and Children;— tho' such a Thing has lately been devised!</P>
<P>And as the <HI>French</HI> have for a long Time, been the Plagues of <HI>Europe,</HI> con∣tinually embroiling the Nations, so now they are become the the <HI>Disturbers</HI> and <HI>Incendiaries</HI> of <HI>America:</HI> and (it seems) have, without asking Leave of
<PB N="19" REF="007583_0019_102D7F5D2A95D718"/>
Heaven, doom'd us all to utter, swift Destruction, without the tedious Ceremony of an <HI>Inquisition</HI>—Now then, let us lay these Things together, and say, Whether it does not <HI>behave</HI> us, as <HI>Men,</HI> as <HI>Eritons</HI> by Descent, and as <HI>Christians</HI> by Profession, to <HI>awake</HI> from our Slumbers, to <HI>start</HI> from our Beds of Ease and Indolence; to <HI>Rush to Arms,</HI> and to <HI>Play the Man for our People, and for the Cities of our God: And let the Lord do that which seemeth good unto Him.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. I shall now close the <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>tragic Scene,</HI> with a serious Exhortation to the <HI>Use of Means, conducive</HI> both to our <HI>temporal</HI> and <HI>spiritual Interests.</HI></P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">(1) Let us <HI>devise,</HI> and <HI>use</HI> such Means, as will probably disconcert the Schemes of the <HI>French,</HI> disappoint their Devices, and break their Mea∣sures.—As we have a subtile and deceitful Enemy to deal with, so we ought to be more strictly upon our Guard, and to use those Faculties with which we are endued (for all necessary and good Purposes) in prying into▪ and discovering their Schemes, and Artifices; that we may be able to counter-plot and counter-act them. They often get as great Advantages by <HI>Artifice,</HI> as by <HI>Action</HI>: And why cannot we attempt something of this Kind?—Why can we not believe they always intend to deceive us, when they dare; and order our Matters accordingly?—Are we obliged to be∣lieve them, because they speak fair?—</P>
<P>Perhaps it would be thought impertinent at this Time, if I should insist upon the <HI>Expediency</HI> and <HI>Necessity</HI> of building and repairing <HI>Castles, Forts,</HI> and other <HI>Places</HI> of <HI>Defence</HI>; and keeping them in <HI>good Order,</HI> and <HI>well furnished</HI> with <HI>all Kinds</HI> of war-like Stores:—But as this has been much ne∣glected by the <HI>English,</HI> in many Places, I thought it might bear men∣tioning at least—<HI>among their Polities!</HI> For when they should have them <HI>ready,</HI> they too often have them to <HI>build</HI> or <HI>repair</HI>;—notwithstanding they see a designing, encroaching Enemy, <HI>fortifying all around</HI> them, even in Times of Peace.—But as we have begun to <HI>revise</HI> our <HI>Politics,</HI> it is to be hoped we shall <HI>descry</HI> their <HI>Defects,</HI> and <HI>mend</HI> them in Time.</P>
<P>As to our <HI>Militia</HI>—a proper Care thereof has been as much neglected, in some Governments, as our Fortifications, tho' it is a <HI>necessary Mean</HI> of Self-Preservation and Defence.—King <HI>David,</HI> that <HI>great Warrior</HI> and <HI>wise Politician,</HI> never lost a Battle; and it was owing in Part to the good Care he took of the <HI>Militia,</HI> as the Means. And it would be no Disparagement to our <HI>greatest Generals,</HI> to imitate him herein; and to inspire their Men with Ambition to excel in Military Feats and Exercises.—After the Defeat
<PB N="20" REF="007583_0020_102D7F5F0AB220F0"/>
of <HI>Saul</HI> and <HI>Jonathan, David had them</HI> (the Officers) <HI>teach</HI> even <HI>the Children of</HI> Judah <HI>the Use of the Bow,</HI> which had been neglected by <HI>Saul</HI>; or it might have been a late Invention of the <HI>Philistines,</HI> that had not been discover'd by him: But it prov'd his Overthrow; for <HI>the Archers shot at him, and wounded him sore.</HI> It is good Policy to acquaint ourselves with all the Arts of War in Use among our Enemies, that we may know how to defend ourselves, and annoy them, when we come to an Engagement: And to take Care that none but <HI>able-bodied, effective Men, well disciplin'd,</HI> be sent out to fight <HI>those Battles</HI> for us, upon which the <HI>Fate</HI> of our Country depends.—And the more firmly they are attach'd to the Government, in Defence of which they fight, the better—But what can be expected from a Number of raw, un∣disciplin'd, debauch'd, enfeebled, dissaffected, Mortals?—And those that are sent to war, ought to be equip'd with every Thing necessary therefor; and to be sent <HI>in due Season</HI>; for <HI>great Advantages</HI> may be lost by <HI>soort De∣lays</HI>; and a <HI>long Train</HI> of bad Consequences follow. A vast Expence of hu∣man Blood, and Treasure, may be saved by <HI>Dispatch.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>all the Governments</HI> ought to DO their Proportion in <HI>supplying Men and Money</HI>;—for it is mean and fordid for any to attempt to <HI>cast the Burden</HI> upon others.—All the <HI>British</HI> Colonies consider'd <HI>collectively</HI> and <HI>politically,</HI> are <HI>one Body,</HI> tho' consisting of many Members. Ought not every Member then to do its Part, to preserve the whole Body? For if the Head be cut off, all the rest of the Members will soon wither and die. This then is a Touch∣stone, that will soon discover who are public-spirited, and who are not. If every one, by <HI>Parsimony,</HI> should try to <HI>save all,</HI> every one would <HI>cer∣tainly lose all</HI> in a short Time. But to give liberally upon such great Oc∣casions, is a Duty, that all, who have Ability, owe to their GREAT BENEFACTOR, to their King, their Country, Themselves, and their Posterity.—But here it ought to be noted, That Four of the most <HI>Northern</HI> Governments have exerted themselves in so free and generous a Manner, that they have almost <HI>out-done</HI> themselves; and can do but <HI>little more</HI> in any future Expeditions, unless they have such Assistance from their Mo∣ther Country, as the Exigence and Extremity of their Case require.</P>
<P>It is also necessary, that <HI>all the Governments cut off,</HI> as much as possible, <HI>all Supplies</HI> of Provision (which is one of the main Sinews of War) from the Enemy, both <HI>directly</HI> and <HI>indirectly,</HI> by breaking up that <HI>illegal, clandestine</HI> Trade, which some <HI>intestine</HI> Enemies to the Government, carry on in a Time of War. This will certainly do much toward the suppressing our
<PB N="21" REF="007583_0021_102D7F60F73A84F0"/>
public Enemies, and some think more, than all our Forces. For, if they are not supplied <HI>by</HI> and <HI>from Us,</HI> they must starve in a short Time, or sur∣render without fighting. And this will prevent the spilling vast Quantities of human Blood, which is too precious to be bartered away for <HI>French</HI> Commodities by our clandestine Traders;—a Set of short-sighted Men, whose Eyes are so full of the <HI>Dust</HI> of <HI>present</HI> personal Gain, that they can∣not foresee one of those dreadful Consequences of this their Practice, that will inevitably fall upon their Posterity; and perhaps upon themselves:— If so, their Blood will be upon their own Heads; and the Blood of their Country will, in a great Measure, be required at their Hands, in the Day of Judgment.</P>
<P><HI>Unanimity</HI> and a <HI>good Understanding</HI> among the <HI>English</HI> Governments in <HI>America,</HI> is another <HI>excellent</HI> and <HI>necessary Mean</HI> of saving the whole Country from the Ravages of the Enemy; and indeed from <HI>utter Ruin.</HI>—For while our <HI>Heads</HI> and <HI>Leaders</HI> are resenting Affronts, and contending among themselves about Points of Honor, as well as <HI>Duty,</HI> the important, and pressing Affairs of Government, and of War, must be neglected.—In the mean Time, our Enemies are <HI>unanimous, vigilant, active,</HI> and <HI>swift</HI> as Eagles; never failing to seize those Advantages, which our unhappy Divisions, Contentions, and Delays, always give them.—Do not then the Exigence and Importance of our public Affairs require, that our <HI>civil Rulers,</HI> our <HI>Generals,</HI> and <HI>Officers,</HI> in ALL the Governments, pay so sacred a Regard to the <HI>Great Trust</HI> reposed in them, as strictly to guard against every Thing that tends to a <HI>Misunderstanding,</HI> and opens a Door to <HI>Contention</HI> and <HI>Divi∣sion</HI>?—And to <HI>cultivate,</HI> as much as possible, a <HI>good Understanding</HI> among themselves? This is excellent Policy, especially in a Time of War; agreeable to our Saviour's Words, <HI>Mark</HI> 3.24, 25. <HI>If a Kingdom be di∣vided against itself, that Kingdom cannot stand. And if a House be di∣vided against itself, that House cannot stand.</HI> If the <HI>British</HI> Colonies in <HI>America</HI> be divided against themselves, how <HI>can</HI> they stand, at such a Time as this, when they have Need to UNITE their Councils, and collect their scatter'd Forces, and to pour them with Fury upon our <HI>invidious</HI> and <HI>perfi∣dous</HI> Enemies? If this should be our Case (as there is some Reason to fear it may be) <HI>Great-Britain itself</HI> cannot save us from the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> For God's Sake therefore, let both <HI>Rulers,</HI> and <HI>Generals,</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> hearken to the excellent Advice of <HI>Solomon,</HI> the wisest of Kings, and of mere Men. <HI>Prov.</HI> 17.14. <HI>The Beginning of Strife, is as when one letteth out Water; therefore leave off Contention before it be meddled with.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="007583_0022_102D7F62B8CDAFE0"/>We proceed to another Branch of Exhortation.</P>
<P N="2">(2) If we hope for Success in War, let us put away all our Accursed Things.</P>
<P>There are many such among us; and they must be put away; or they will <HI>bring down</HI> the <HI>Judgments of God</HI> upon our <HI>Fleets, Armies,</HI> and <HI>Pro∣vinces</HI>; and upon the <HI>whole Kingdom</HI>: They <HI>must be taken away,</HI> both <HI>Root</HI> and <HI>Branch,</HI> by <HI>Faith, Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Reformation.</HI> And when this Peo∣ple is a more holy and humble People; then, but not till then, they will be a happy and blessed People: And God himself will delight to dwell with them. Let us all then, both Magistrates and Ministers, Generals and Admirals, and the other Officers, with the common Soldiers and Ma∣rines, be sensible of the <HI>Corruption</HI> of our Hearts, and the <HI>Wickedness</HI> of our Lives; and apply to the <HI>Blood</HI> of Christ for Pardon and Cleansing. And having so done, let us <HI>repent in Dust and Ashes, and forsake all our evil Ways; and make our Ways and Doings good.</HI> And <HI>when our Ways please God, then he will make even our Enemies to be at Peace with us.</HI></P>
<P>Particularly, let us put away <HI>Drunkenness</HI> and <HI>Debauchery</HI> from our <HI>Cities</HI> and <HI>Camps.—Query,</HI> Are not lewd Women <HI>Accursed Things</HI> in our Camps? Do any but <HI>such</HI> follow Armies? Ought they not then to be taken away? Do Soldiers in the Field need any Thing to be done for them, which they cannot do well enough themselves?</P>
<P>And having made all the necessary Dispositions for War with our Fel∣low Men, let us not <HI>bid Defiance</HI> to Heaven by our Sins; but put them away—And <HI>set up our Banners in the Name of the Lord</HI>; and no more <HI>venture</HI> out into the Field of Battle, under the Standard of <HI>Self-Sufficiency,</HI>—nor <HI>dare</HI> again to <HI>display</HI> the Colours of <HI>Self-Confidence,</HI> since we have had such sad Experience of the Folly of <HI>trusting to an Arm of Flesh,</HI> which is weak in itself, and easily broken— Nor let our Officers and Men dare to <HI>discharge Vollies</HI> of profane Oaths and Curses against the <HI>Battlements</HI> of Heaven, as many of them daily do; whereby they seem <HI>professedly</HI> to <HI>set out</HI> on an <HI>Ex∣pedition against Heaven</HI>; and <HI>do practically besiege</HI> the <HI>Throne itself</HI> of God.</P>
<P><HI>Generals</HI> and <HI>Admirals,</HI> and their Officers, have it in their Power to do <HI>public Honor</HI> to the Great Name of God, by making and giving out Laws in their Camps, and Fleets, with a severe Penalty annext, forbidding pro∣fane Swearing and Cursing; not neglecting <HI>duly to inflict</HI> the same, when <HI>incurr'd.</HI>—And they should make it appear, by their <HI>own Conversation,</HI> that they <HI>reverence</HI> and <HI>fear that most holy and dreadful Name.</HI>—And the only <HI>Strife</HI> among Civil and Military Officers, should be, <HI>Who</HI> among them shall be
<PB N="23" REF="007583_0023_102D7F64C26CD980"/>
the <HI>most virtuous</HI> and <HI>exemplary</HI>; and <HI>who</HI> shall do the <HI>best Service</HI> for their King and Country.</P>
<P>To proceed,</P>
<P N="3">(3) Let us adjoin <HI>Prayer</HI> to Almighty God, as a special appointed Means of <HI>Success,</HI> in all our Enterprizes.</P>
<P>God is to be <HI>acknowledged</HI> in all our Ways, <HI>by Prayer,</HI> especially in our <HI>Wars.</HI> And for an Encouragement to this Duty, He styles himself, <HI>A God bearing Prayer.</HI>—When he had made large Promises, to the <HI>Jews</HI> in Captivity, of temporal and spiritual Blessings, He subjoins, <HI>Yet for all this, will I be enquired of by the House of</HI> Israel, <HI>to do it for them.</HI></P>
<P>As therefore we have taken the <HI>Sword</HI> in one Hand, we ought to take <HI>Prayer</HI> in the other. You may <HI>pray and fight,</HI> at the same Time: And the more ardently you pray for God's Blessing and Protection, the more likely you will be to do good Execution among your Enemies; and to escape with your own Lives too. All they that go forth to war, ought to <HI>exercise</HI> and <HI>express</HI> a <HI>humble Dependance</HI> upon the Lord of Hosts, and to <HI>trust</HI> in Him for Safety. <HI>For the Battle is His, and he giveth it to whomsoever be pleaseth.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then pray, that God Almighty would be pleased to bless and preserve <HI>King GEORGE,</HI> and the whole <HI>Royal-Family</HI>—and the <HI>British Ministry</HI>: That he would bless our <HI>Governors</HI> and <HI>Counsellors</HI>; our <HI>Gene∣rals</HI> and <HI>Admirals,</HI>—and make them the <HI>Guardians</HI> of our spiritual Privile∣ges, and civil Liberties; and the <HI>Assertors</HI> and <HI>Defenders</HI> of our Rights and Properties—That he would make our <HI>Armies couragious, valiant,</HI> and <HI>victorious</HI>—That he would <HI>cover their Heads in the Day of Battle</HI>—And that they may go on from conquering to conquer, till ALL our Enemies shall be <HI>subdued</HI> under us—That he would prepare us for so great a Mercy, by <HI>pouring out his Spirit upon us,</HI> and <HI>his Blessing upon our Offspring</HI>; and thereby dispose us to a <HI>thorough Reformation l—But let thine Enemies perish, O God, scatter thou the People, that delight in War.—Let God arise, let his Enemies be scattered, let them that hate him, she before him: As Wax melteth before the Fire, so let them be consumed at thy Presence: For thou, Lord, art great in</HI> Zion: <HI>Thou art high above all People.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Fathers and Brethren,</HI> if we do these Things aright, no doubt God will be <HI>for us,</HI> and enable us to <HI>stand before our Enemies.</HI>—Then shall our Armies return from Battle crowned with Victory, and cloathed with Tri∣umph—<HI>rejoicing in the Salvation of the Lord,</HI> and <HI>triumphing in his Promise.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="007583_0024_102D7F66A8046E38"/>To conclude,</P>
<P N="4">(4) Let us all list under the Lord Jesus Christ, by Faith, who is the Captain of Salvation; and then we shall be able to <HI>stand before</HI> ALL <HI>our Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>Being sensible, dear Friends, of your Captivity and Bondage to Sin and Satan, you should learn your Need of the Ransom which Christ has paid to Divine Justice for guilty Men, which was his own Blood—a Price of infinite Value!—He became <HI>obedient to Death, even the Death of the Cross,</HI> that Sinners might have Life.—This is the <HI>Righteousness</HI> that he wrought out, the <HI>Ransom</HI> that he paid, for such as were condemn'd to die by the Law, and to be tormented forever, for their many Rebellions and Hosti∣lities against the King of Heaven. But, tho' ye are Rebels by Nature, and condemned to die by Law; yet, if you will come and list under the <HI>Captain of Salvation,</HI> and submit to Him, on his Terms, you shall be <HI>par∣don'd, accepted,</HI> and <HI>saved</HI>: For he is the Great Captain of all the Forces, that are raised, and to be raised, in the Church-militant!—And as soon as you inlist, you shall be intitled to the Large Bounty which he has pro∣mis'd in the Proclamation of Grace:—And for the Service you perform in his spiritual Kingdom, you shall be rewarded with a Crown of Glory in Heaven.—But such is the <HI>Enmity of your carnal Minds</HI> against him, that you will never become <HI>Voluntiers,</HI> till you are made <HI>willing in the Day of his Power.</HI></P>
<P>And, you ought to consider, that when you are inlisted among his Fol∣lowers, you will soon <HI>receive Orders to march out into the Field of Battle, and to engage with Principalities and Powers,</HI> with the <HI>Rulers of the Darkness of this World,</HI> and with <HI>wicked Spirits</HI> in <HI>heavenly Places.</HI> In this Case, you must by no Means desert your Colours, but <HI>put on the whole Armour of God,</HI> and <HI>fight the good Fight of Faith,</HI> as you hope to <HI>lay hold on eternal Life.</HI> And in order to this, you must obey the Instructions which he has given by the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> which are recorded in his Epistle to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> 6.10.— <HI>Finally, my Brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might. Put on the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the Wiles of the Devil.—Take unto you the whole Armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil Day; and having done all, to stand. STAND there∣fore, having your Loins girt about with Truth, and having on the Breast plate of Righteousness; and your Feet shed with the Preparation of the Gospel of Peace: Above all, taking the Shield of Faith, whereby ye shall be able to quench all the fiery Darts of the Wicked▪ And take the Helmet of Salvation, and the
<PB N="25" REF="007583_0025_102D7F68CE933B50"/>
Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.</HI> You must learn the Art of <HI>using skilfully the Shield of Faith,</HI> or you will be often wounded by the <HI>In∣fernal Archers,</HI> who shoot no other than <HI>fiery Darts</HI>;—and of <HI>handling dexterously the Sword of the Spirit,</HI> or you will never overcome them. And you must be continually upon your Guard, <HI>watching against their Devices,</HI> that you may never be surprized; but always ready to <HI>withstand their Wiles,</HI> by the Force of <HI>constant Prayer and Supplication in the Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>And now you must <HI>stand strong,</HI> fight couragiously in the spiritual War∣fare, and shew yourselves valiant Soldiers of the Captain of Salvation. And you may be assur'd, that as it is the Son of God, who is styl'd <HI>the Captain of the Lord's Hosts,</HI> that leads you out into the Field of Battle; so, he will be your CHAMPION, to bring you off <HI>more than Conquerors,</HI> at last.</P>
<P>Having therefore inlisted <HI>under</HI> Him, you should encourage yourselves <HI>in</HI> Him, upon <HI>every Appearance of Danger</HI>;—and be <HI>strong</HI> upon all <HI>Occa∣sions.</HI>—Let not your <HI>Graces</HI> be like the <HI>Soldiers</HI> of <HI>Saul,</HI> who <HI>stood</HI> with him trembling, but like the <HI>Worthies</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> able to <HI>break thro'</HI> an Host of Enemies, and draw Water at the Wells of Salvation.—And if at any Time you should be wounded and soiled, <HI>look</HI> to your <HI>Leader,</HI> and he will <HI>heal</HI> you, and <HI>raise</HI> you up; for he is <HI>all-sufficient.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>be then faithful to the Death</HI> (for thou must <HI>once</HI> pass through <HI>that gloomy Vale,</HI> either in a natural or violent Way, to the bright triumphant World above) and then, tho' thou wast ranked among the meanest of his Followers here, thou shalt be array'd and adorn'd with a Palm of final Victory, a Diadem of immaculate Beauty, and a Crown of immortal Glory; and shalt live and reign with Him in His Kingdom; where there is no Noise nor Rumour of War, but <HI>all the Region is everlasting Peace.</HI>— Where sits the PRINCE of Peace, in <HI>State</HI> of Glory, on his Throne, in the Midst of <HI>Myriads</HI> of blessed Spirits; the <HI>Delight</HI> of every Eye, the <HI>Joy</HI> of every Heart, the <HI>supreme</HI> Rest and Satisfaction of every happy Soul. To whom be GLORY, DOMINION, and POWER forever. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
