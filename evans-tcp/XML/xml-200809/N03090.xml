<OPENER><SALUTE>Most Honourable and Reverend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR Correspondent Members in <HI>New England,</HI> by the Blessing of GOD on their Endeavours, according to the Trust re∣posed in Them, having seen the Solemn <HI>Ordination of Your Three Missionaries to the Natives on our Borders,</HI> approved and attended joyfully by the <HI>Churches of</HI> CHRIST here; were pleased to order the <HI>Sermon</HI> preached, together with the <HI>Charge</HI> given, and the <HI>Fellowship of the Churches</HI> testified on that Oc∣casion, to be printed; and that the Whole should be humbly Dedicated to YOU in their Name.</P>
<P>In Obedience therefore to the Command of <HI>His Excellency</HI> our GOVERNOUR, and of the Gentlemen your <HI>Commissioners</HI> here, we have the Honour to present the following Sheets to <HI>Your Honourable Board;</HI> believing
<PB REF="003723_0003_10024B0002CC3F60"/>
that notwithstanding all the <HI>Defects</HI> which Persons of your Learning will easily see in them, yet they will find a <HI>candid</HI> Acceptance with You: And that the Knowledge of this Beginning of your <HI>Mission</HI> will ex∣cite, as the <HI>Thanksgivings</HI> of Many to GOD, and their <HI>Prayers</HI> for the Progress of it under the Smiles of His Providence and Grace, so likewise the <HI>Charitable Con∣tributions</HI> of Some for the more effectual Support of it in Times to come.</P>
<P>You have made us too much <HI>Parties</HI> in the glorious Design of your Incorporation, for Us to allow Our Selves to go into the <HI>Praises</HI> due to it, which must needs be in all the <HI>Churches</HI> of CHRIST, so long as the <HI>true Intention</HI> of the <HI>pious Donors</HI> is faithfully pursued, as we are confident it always will be by You, in the Propa∣gation of the Principles of the Christian Protestant Religion in Places that <HI>most need</HI> the Knowledge there∣of, and among People that are <HI>indeed perishing</HI> for want of it. Not to keep strictly to <HI>these Rules</HI> were to pro∣stitute a very <HI>Sacred Trust</HI> and Confidence reposed in You, and to forfeit the <HI>Blessing</HI> of a Righteous Pro∣vidence.</P>
<P>We thank GOD who has so far crown'd your sincere Labour of Love with <HI>Success</HI> in Your own <HI>Isles</HI> and <HI>High-lands:</HI> And tho' Clouds and Darkness do very much incompass your present Excellent Attempt <HI>here</HI> in our Borders, by reason of the Prejudices of <HI>Popery</HI> sown in the Minds of the <HI>Salvages</HI> by the <HI>Jesuits</HI> and <HI>Friars</HI> who sojourn among them; yet there is nothing too hard for GOD: Or if He deny the desir'd Suc∣cess we trust He will say, "<HI>You did well that it was in your Heart;</HI> and our <HI>Brethren</HI> here who are Com∣panions with your <HI>Missionaries</HI> at Home <HI>in the Kingdom and Patience of</HI> JESUS CHRIST, will with them be <HI>precious</HI> in the Eyes of the LORD.</P>

Our Days are happily fallen in those <HI>Times</HI> whereof the DIVINE SPIRIT spake to the Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> when <HI>many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased.</HI> The BLESSED AND ONLY POTENTATE in these His Times is performing this by <HI>the Navigation of Great Britain,</HI> and other Kingdoms of <HI>Europe.</HI> For how easily and swiftly is the Knowledge of the <HI>True</HI> GOD, and of the <HI>Only</HI> SAVIOUR, communicated hereby from one End of the Earth to the other? And O that the <HI>Maritime Pro∣testant Powers</HI> would more bring their <HI>Glory and Ho∣nour</HI> into the Administration of this Service! not only by granting their <HI>Letters Patents</HI> in Favour, of it to the <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Pious</HI> in their Dominions that are well dis∣posed toward it, but also by Opening of Their Own <HI>Treasures</HI> for its Support! As <HI>David</HI> set his Affection to the House of his GOD, and gave of His own pro∣per Good, of Silver and Gold.</P>
<P>We are sure that Empires and States, Provinces and Cities cannot better consecrate a Part of their Riches unto CHRIST. And the <HI>Promise</HI> of the GREAT GOD which stands so near the <HI>Prophesy</HI> before mentioned from the Book of <HI>Daniel,</HI> is well worthy of the am∣bitious Regards of the many <HI>Noble and Mighty</HI> of this World; and should inspire <HI>Them</HI> as well as the <HI>Poor Ministers and Missionaries</HI> in the Kingdom of our LORD JESUS: <Q>AND THEY THAT BE WISE SHALL SHINE AS THE FIRMAMENT, AND THEY THAT TURN MANY TO RIGHTEOUSNESS AS THE STARS FOR EVER AND EVER.</Q> This gracious <HI>Promise</HI> is not so much to be understood (as a worthy <HI>Divine</HI> has long since ob∣served, in his Dedication of his <HI>Theory of the Earth</HI> to the late Excellent <HI>Queen</HI> MARY) of the Illumination <Q>and Conversion of <HI>single Souls,</HI> as of <HI>Nations</HI> and <HI>People;</HI> the turning the WORLD to Righteousness. They that lead on that happy Work shall be dis∣tinguished in Glory from the rest of Mankind.</Q></P>

This is the proper Work of SOCIETIES and Combi∣nations of Men, under the Countenance of <HI>Christian</HI> PRINCES: And may the <HI>Illustrious House of our</HI> KING bear away a glorious Part of the <HI>Recompences in the Day of</HI> CHRIST, that shall be to the <HI>Societies</HI> of his <HI>Sub∣jects,</HI> who are by <HI>His Authority</HI> spreading the Know∣ledge of the Way of Salvation to the Ends of the Earth.</P>
<P>We need not ask your continued <HI>Prayers</HI> for Us while we are ministring under You, and much less a Remembrance at the Throne of Grace for <HI>Your Missi∣onaries</HI> who are returned to their respective Posts of Service; Nor shall we cease to pray for the <HI>Honourable Society,</HI> that the special Direction of GOD may ever attend their Counsels, and His Blessing always crown their faithful Endeavours with great Success.</P>

<HEAD>CHRIST Victorious Over the Powers of Darkness, By the Light of His Preached Gospel.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ACTS XXVI. 16,—19.</BIBL>
<Q><L><HI>But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a wit∣ness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may re∣ceive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision.</HI></L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Chapter <HI>Paul</HI> declares before King <HI>Agrippa</HI> and others, his extraordinary Con∣version and Call to the Apostolic Office. When he set out on his Journey towards <HI>Damascus,</HI> it was breathing out threatnings and slaughter against the Disciples of the LORD; but behold, the triumph of Al∣mighty Power and Sovereign Grace! In the way, our <HI>exalted</HI> SAVIOUR shin'd down upon him with a Light above th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> brightness of the Sun; and when he was
<PB N="2" REF="003723_0007_10024B0AD1164868"/>
fallen to the Earth, said to him, <HI>Saul, Saul,</HI> why persecuted thou me? So near is the relation between CHRIST the Head, and the Members of His mystical Body, that what is done to them, he takes as done to himself. 1 Cor. xii. 12. <HI>As the body is one and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</HI> Mat. xxv. 40. And now, trembling, he says, <HI>Who art thou Lord?</HI> He knew not that JESUS was the <HI>promised Messiah,</HI> till he thus revealed himself to him. And how wonderful is it that this Appearance should be, not only to Convert him, but also to Call him to be an Apostle, that he might Convert many others! Divine Goodness overcame his Evil, and where Sin did abound, Grace super-abounded.</P>
<P>I shall here take notice of several things as they lie in the Text. 1. He was <HI>Call'd</HI> to be a <HI>Minister,</HI> and this he had in common with others that preach the Gospel; however he was also call'd to be a <HI>Witness</HI> of the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of JESUS CHRIST, whom he had now seen; and received extraordi∣nary Gifts whereby he might confirm his Testimony. 2. We have a <HI>Promise of deliverance</HI> from the People &amp;c. <HI>ver.</HI> 17. By the People, understand the <HI>Jews,</HI> who were many of them filled with rage against him upon his turning Christian. GOD protected him under innumerable Dangers while he had Work for him to do, and then gave him the crown of Martyrdom; Faith and patience and courage to suffer for the Name of JESUS, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 6. Ecclesiastical History informs us that he was beheaded under <HI>Nero.</HI> 3. We have the <HI>great Errand</HI> upon which he was <HI>sent,</HI> ver. 18. <HI>To open their Eyes &amp;c. Paul</HI> was in a peculiar manner the Apostle of the Gentiles, who were under Heathen-ignorance, and so under the power of Satan.—He is sent <HI>to turn them from darkness &amp;c.</HI> that is, as on Instrument in the hand of CHRIST, whose Work this is. 4. We have the <HI>gracious Design</HI> of our LORD in this Work, and the End which crowns it: <HI>That they may rece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve forgiveness &amp;c.</HI> 5. We have <HI>his obedient submission</HI> to this divine Call, <HI>ver.</HI> 19. Our LORD spake to his Heart, and made him willing in the day of his power. He tells us, <HI>Gal.</HI> i 15, 16. When it pleased God to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; <HI>immediately I conferred not with fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh and blood.</HI> He look'd above himself, to him that call'd him, and without de∣lay set about the Work; and when he had preach'd the Gospel, as is suppos'd, above twenty years, he could say, ver. 22. context. <HI>Having obtained help of God, I continue to this day.</HI></P>
<P>From the Words, and as related to the Context, we may observe the following Doctrines.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="doctrine">
<PB N="3" REF="003723_0008_10024B0C588311F8"/>
<HEAD>DOCT. I. Our LORD JESUS CHRIST calls and sends forth the Ministers of the Gospel.</HEAD>
<P>Ver. 16.—<HI>To make thee a Minister</HI>—ver. 17.—<HI>Unto whom I send thee.</HI> Indeed this <HI>Call</HI> was <HI>immediate,</HI> neither of Men, nor by Men; but by a glorious Appearance of CHRIST, and his Voice from Heaven: however, he continues to speak to his People in his Word, and to declare his will; and therefore tho' Men may be the Instruments, yet when the Rules of the Gospel of CHRIST are observ'd, the Call of Ministers is from him. This Divine Person, GOD-Man-Mediator, is the glorious Head of his Church, whose Prerogative it is to ap∣point the Laws and Ordinances of his House, and Officers that are to act under him in his visible Kingdom on Earth. Accordingly, after his Resurrection, He said to his Disciples, <HI>All power is given unto me in heaven and on earth. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things what∣soever I have commanded you,</HI> Mat. xxviii. 18,—20. And when our LORD ascended on high, he received Gifts for Men, and he gave some <HI>Apostles</HI>—: and some, <HI>Pastors and Teachers,</HI> Eph. iv 11. Now, that these ordinary Officers last mentioned, were appointed to succeed the <HI>Apostle,</HI> in the Work of the Ministry, is evident from the great design of this Gift and Institution. It follows, ver. 12, 13. <HI>For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.</HI> Upon which Mr. <HI>Burkitt</HI> observes, <Q>the <HI>Apostle</HI> declares how long the Work of the Ministry appointed by CHRIST for his Church's edification and advantage, was to continue; namely, to the End of the World, <HI>till all come</HI> &amp;c.</Q> And this is further evident from the directions given in GOD's Word, respecting the Qualifications of such Ministers, and their Separation to this Work. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 2,—11. <HI>Tit.</HI> i. 5,—9. And whereas they stand in absolute need of the Presence of CHRIST with them, His most gracious Promise given when He commission'd his Disciples to teach in his Name, was not restrain'd to them, and the Age wherein they liv'd; but ex∣tended to Gospel Ministers to the End of the World. Mat. xxviii. 20.—<HI>Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the World.</HI> And inasmuch as the Great GOD our SAVIOUR makes Overseers or Bishops, and effectually calls his chosen People, <HI>by his Spirit, Act.</HI> xx. 28. <HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 5, 6. He promis'd that the HOLY GHOST, who is also a Divine Person, should be sent from the Father in vertue of his Intercession, and that <HI>to abide with his People for ever,</HI> Joh. xiv. 16, 17. Upon the whole, we may conclude, that our LORD JESUS CHRIST continueth to call and send forth Gospel Ministers.</P>

<HEAD>PROP. I. T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Children of Men are since the Fall in darkness, and under the power of Satan.</HEAD>
<P>GOD created Man at the first in his own Image, gave him the perfect understanding of his Law, and power to keep it; set him at the head of the visible Creation, giving him the dominion over it, and requiring him to collect the tribute of Praise which was his due from the inferiour Creatures, and pay it to him: But alass! Man being in honour abode not. <HI>Adam,</HI> who stood as a publick Person in the first Covenant, sinn'd, and we in him. Rom. v. 12. <HI>By one man sin entred into the world, and death by sin; and so death hath passed upon all men, for that all have sinned.</HI> Thus both sin and misery en∣tred into this World, and Satan having prevail'd in his temp∣tation, obtain'd a dreadful power.—We have the description of the apostate Children of <HI>Adam,</HI> Rom. iii. 9. <HI>They are all under sin.</HI> ver. 10. <HI>There is none righteous, no not one.</HI> ver. 16. <HI>Destruction and misery are in their ways.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They are in Darkness.</HI></P>
<P>Darkness, in the proper acceptation of the word, signifieth <HI>the privation of light,</HI> when the Sun which rules the Day is withdrawn from us: And in a metaphorical and borrow'd sense, in which the Scriptures often useth it, darkness signifies both <HI>moral <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d penal Evil,</HI> sin and the misery consequent upon it. Accordingly, when the Son of GOD who saves from both, was manifest in flesh, and arose as the <HI>Sun of Righte∣ousness,</HI> to make and rule the <HI>Gospel-day;</HI> it is said that <HI>the day spring from on high visited his people, to give light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death,</HI> Luk. i. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8, 9. And such as are made an holy nation and peculiar people to GOD, are said to be called <HI>out of darkness into his marvellous light,</HI> 1 Pet. ii. 9. It's true of all that are Converted, and in an eminent manner verified in such as are turned from heathen ignorance. More particularly,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The Children of Men <HI>have their Hearts blinded, and so are alienated from the life of God</HI> Eph. iv. 18. <HI>Having the un∣derstanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, because of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndness of their heart.</HI> Indeed Men have some kind of knowledge of GOD, and of his Law which was at first written on the Heart, enough to leave even the Heathen without excuse, that <HI>when they knew God, they glorified him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as God.</HI> But alass <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this

Wherefore GOD also gave them up <HI>to uncleanness,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> between themselves; and unto <HI>vile affections,</HI> ver. 24, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ They were not only abominable in their way of Worship; but also full of all <HI>unrighteousness</HI> in their behaviour towards Men. Psal. lxxiv. 20.—<HI>The dark places of the Earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</HI> Yea, such is the darkness of Men's minds, that when the light of the Gospel shines upon them, they need to have their Understandings o∣pened that they may see and know the truth. Their Reason is so deprav'd by Sin, and they are so fill'd with Prejudice against the Gospel, that they will not receive the saving Truths thereof, unless it please GOD by His Spirit to heal their Souls, and restore spiritual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight unto them. 1 Cor. ii. 14. <HI>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; neither can be know them, because they are spi∣ritually discerned.</HI> Yea, such is the enmity of the carnal Mind against GOD and his Law, that when Sinners are left to them∣selves, they rebel against the clearest Light. Thus it was when the Son of GOD came as the light of the World, to declare his Father, and reveal his Will. Joh. iii. 19. <HI>This is the con∣demnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved dark∣ness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>The Children of Men are brought into a miserable condition by Sin, and upon this account may be said to be in darkness.</HI> Calamity is fitly set forth by this similitude, and is an inseparable compani∣on of <HI>sin,</HI> Lam. iii 2. <HI>He hath brought me into darkness, but not into light.</HI> No sooner were our first Parents fallen from God, but an horror of darkness seiz'd on them; afraid, they fled from the pre∣sence of that God in whose favour had been their Life: this lower World fell under a dreadful Curse, and hath been <HI>a dark place</HI> to their Posterity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver since. <HI>Man that is born of a woman, is of few days, and full of trouble.</HI> Job xiv. 1. He is subject to great disquietments of Mind, and horror of Conscience; to Sickness, Pain, Bereave∣ments; and in a word, to innumerable Evils Spiritual and Tempo∣ral, till his Eyes are clos'd in darkness, and he descend to the Grave, of which <HI>Job</HI> elegantly speaks, Chap. x. 22. <HI>A land of dark∣ness, as darkness it self, and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</HI> But alass! all this is but the be∣ginning of sorrows which must never end.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) The Children of Men are in darkness; <HI>for they lie expos'd to the eternal Torments of Hell.</HI> And there is reserved for them <HI>the</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="003723_0011_10024B1221993A10"/>
<HI>blackness of darkness forever.</HI> Jude 13. <HI>The wages of Sin is death.</HI> Rom. vi. 23. Not only temporal, but spiritual and eternal Death. Mat. xxv. 46. <HI>These shall go away into everlasting punishment.</HI> The infinite∣ly glorious GOD is offended, and therefore no temporary suffering of the damned can make full satisfaction; they must be forever paying the vast debt they owe to GOD's justice, and so suffer the everlasting Destruction of Body and Soul in that place of Tor∣ments, where no beam of light ever shines; for there will be a <HI>vast gulph</HI> fix'd between them and the <HI>blissful presence</HI> of GOD the <HI>Father of lights,</HI> and they must be cast out into <HI>outer darkness.</HI> Here, poor creatures, they might comfort themselves a little with <HI>sparks of their own kindli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> but there, they <HI>lie down in sor∣row;</HI> yea, sink forever in the bottomless Pit without the least gleam of hope. Psal xlix. 19. <HI>He shall go to the generation of his fathers, they shall never see light.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Children of Men are under the power of Satan.</HI></P>
<P>He is the ruler of the darkness of this World, and hath ob∣tain'd a dreadful power over Men by drawing them into sin. This old <HI>Serpent</HI> beguiled <HI>Eve,</HI> and then made use of her as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Instrument to tempt <HI>Adam</HI> to Eat the forbidden fruit: Thus did the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vil prevail, and led our first Parents and their rebellious Race captive. Eph. ii. 2. <HI>Wherein in time past ye walked</HI>—<HI>according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.</HI> The word of GOD speaks of the <HI>Apostate Angels</HI> as united under <HI>one Head,</HI> the Prince of Devils, and so forming a Kingdom of Darkness, in opposition to JESUS CHRIST, and His Kingdom on Earth. <HI>Luke</HI> xi. 18, 19. <HI>Col.</HI> i. 13.

Here we are assur'd that as He was delivered for our Offen∣ces, so that he rose again for our Justification; and that GOD hath exalted Him with his own right Hand to be a Prince, and a Saviour, for to give Repentance to Israel and For∣giveness of Sins.

To them are committed the Oracles of GOD, as a sacred Depositum and Treasure; and as they must keep them, and transmit them to their Posterity; so they must further improve this rich Ta∣lent to the honour of their LORD, and the good of Men, least they fall under the doom of the slothful Servant, who hid his Lord's Talent. The two great Commands of the Law unite to strengthen their Obligation to this Duty; for so far as the Gospel prevails, GOD is made known, and Glory given to Him as the chief Good and highest End of Man; and precious Souls, more worth than a World, are deliver'd and saved. Jam. v. 20. <HI>Let him know, that he which convert∣eth the sinner from the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</HI> Again, What Indignation, what Zeal should it work in us, when we behold Satan, that cursed Usurper, lording it over so great a part of the World? while the faithful Subjects of CHRIST are comparatively few, a little Flock; and how earnest should we be that these deluded Wretches, of one Blood with us, and no worse by Nature than we, may have their Eyes open'd to behold our rightful LORD, and their Hearts inclin'd to bow before Him?

SOCIETIES in <HI>South</HI> and <HI>North Britain,</HI> should provoke us to an holy Emulation; especially, considering GOD hath given us the Possession of this good Land which their Ancestors once inhabited; and that this was the professed Intention of our pious Progenitors, the first Planters of this Country.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This appears in the ROYAL CHARTER granted to the Inhabitants of this <HI>Province,</HI> by their Majesties King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY,</HI> of glorious Memory—"<HI>So as their good Life and orderly Con∣versation may win the</HI> Indians, <HI>Natives of the Country, to the Knowledge and Obedience of the true GOD and SAVIOUR of Mankind, and the Christian Faith, which His Royal Ma∣jesty Our Royal Grand-father King</HI> CHARLES <HI>the First, in His said Letters Patents declar'd was His Royal Intentions, and the Adventurers free Professi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to be the principle End of the said Plantation.</HI>"</NOTE></P>
<P>And here, while I humbly thank our honoured Fathers in the Civil Government, for the liberal Encouragement they have been pleased to give towards this Mission which is the Occasion of our Assembling in GOD's Name this Day; I would with suitable deference propose it to their Consideration, what may further be done by this People to spread the Gos∣pel, particularly among the Indians, which is but to build on the noble Foundation others have laid for us.

And inasmuch as our Compassionate REDEEMER, while on Earth, made Men feel the Effects of his bountiful Love in their Bodies, and so prepar'd the way for their re∣ceiving his heavenly Doctrines, to the Salvation of their Souls; let us imitate this Divine Pattern, and make these poor Creatures know by things they are sensible of, that it is their Interest to be attach'd to us. O let there be such a fair and friendly Commerce carried on with them, as shall adorn the Doctrine of GOD our SAVIOUR, and in some good measure exemplify the perfect Rules of our holy Religion! O that they may behold our good Works, and glorify GOD in this day of Visitation! LORD, our Eyes are unto Thee, the GOD of Salvation, to whom belong the issues from Death: Glorify thy Name, glorify thy Son, by turning these mise∣rable People from Darkness to Light, and from the power of Satan to GOD.</P>

<HEAD>USE. VII. What hath been said may afford Direction and Encouragement to such as are call'd to Preach the Gos∣pel in the dark Places of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>It is profitable for Instruction and Encouragement to all Gospel Ministers, who need both for the right discharge of their holy Calling, which must be attended with great Diffi∣culties in this Evil World, where the <HI>Devil</HI> hath such power by reason of our Sin, that he can't be overcome and cast out but by the <HI>Divine Power.</HI> And in an especial manner, the Text and Doctrines may be improv'd to these Ends, by such as are sent to teach GOD's Word in Places that have been for time immemorial cover'd with thick Darkness, be∣ing destitute of the outward Revelation of the Gospel. The Direction it gives to such is, that they look above themselves to our glorious LORD, who hath all power, and that they go forth with an humble and believing Dependance on Him to whom the FATHER hath given the Heathen for his In∣heritance, and who is able to assert his Right, and subdue them to the Obedience of Faith. Indeed they must heedfully observe the working of his Providence, and what intimations He gives them of his Will by his Word and Spirit; whe∣ther He qualifieth them for, and calls them to engage in such a difficult Work; and when they find good Grounds to believe that they have the Call of GOD, they should dutifully an∣swer, <HI>Here we are, send us.</HI> They must go in Obedience to their Sovereign LORD, and with a single Eye at His Glory as their chiefest and highest End; they must go, sensible that unless He go before them, and condescend to work with and by them, they shall labour in vain; and then they should encourage themselves in the LORD, who is able to do above all we can ask or think. In the 55<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> where we have an illustrious Prophecy of the Call of the Gentiles, <HI>ver.</HI> 4, 5. we have also these encouraging words to strengthen the faith, and raise the hope of GOD's People, ver 8, 9. <HI>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I now proceed more directly to apply these Things to our <HI>Brethren,</HI> who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> We are this Day separating to the great and difficult Work of Gospelizing the <HI>Aboriginal Natives</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n our Borders.</P>
<P><HI>My dear Brethren,</HI> I apprehend GOD in His good Provi∣dence calls us to make further <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in this important Affair, notwithstanding all the Difficulties with which it is attended;
<PB N="19" REF="003723_0024_10024B2F5EFB5DB0"/>
and I trust it is pleasing to Him, that you offer your Selves, and consecrate your Service to the LORD this Day. <HI>Duty is our's, the Event and Success are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ntirely in GOD's Hand.</HI> Now then, let your Eyes be to our Ascended SAVIOUR, while you engage in this Work, and devoutly say with <HI>Moses,</HI> Exod. xxxiii. 15. <HI>If thy Presence go not with us, carry us not up hence.</HI> Let the governing Design of your Undertaking be to glorify GOD, by turning Sinners from Darkness to Light, and from the power of Satan to Him, that they may receive forgiveness of Sins, and Inheritance among them that are Sanctified by faith that is in CHRIST; and being sensible that the Arm of the LORD must be reveal'd to effect this, rely and rest on Him, and be ready to give the Glory of all the least Success unto Him. <HI>Praise wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>teth for thee, O GOD!</HI></P>
<P>In the first place, Give up your selves to the Lord JEHO∣VAH, who is the FATHER, the SON, and the HOLY GHOST, by renewing your Covenant with Him, to be His entirely and for ever; beseeching GOD to pour out His Spirit upon you, to furnish you with all needed Gifts and Graces. Look to it, that you be united to CHRIST by His Spirit dwelling in you; that being wash'd from Sin in His Blood, and cloath'd with his Righteousness, you may be accepted in the Beloved; and then live by the Faith of the SON of GOD, and be strong in the Grace that is in CHRIST JESUS. Cry to that GOD who commanded the Light to shine out of Dark∣ness, that <HI>He would shine into your Hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of GOD, in the face of Jesus Christ,</HI> 2 Cor. 4. 6. Hear and learn of the FATHER the great Truths and My∣steries of the Gospel, that you may be qualified to teach others the Truth as it is in JESUS. You need the teaching of the Anoint∣ing, of GOD by His Spirit; and therefore should earnestly seek to Him to send his Spirit into your Hearts to lead you into all Truth, that you may be as Scribes instructed to the King∣dom of Heaven. And the more you feel the power and taste the sweetness of GOD's Word in your own Souls, the better will you be qualified to <HI>Preach the Kingdom of GOD, and Teach those things which concern the LORD JESUS CHRIST, with all Confidence.</HI> But then, remember that while you tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in the LORD, you must be found in the diligent use of Means: Give your selves therefore to Reading and Study, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your Circumstances will allow; and above all, study your B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>BLES; <HI>for all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness; That the man of God may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works,</HI> 2 Tim. iii. 16, 17. And let GOD's Law and Testimony be your rule and directory in all your Instructions, or there will be no light in them.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="003723_0025_10024B31C790A158"/>
And here give me leave to offer a few Hints.</P>
<P>Let there be a Compendium or Summary of Christian Religion agreable to the Scriptures, and as short and plain as may be, often inculcated, till the Natives shall have learned the <HI>Prin∣ciples of the Doctrine of CHRIST.</HI> Declare to them the only true and living GOD, who made Heaven and Earth, and all things in them; and that He made Man upright, in His own Image. Shew them their vile and miserable State by the Fall. Declare to them that this GOD, who is the FATHER and the SON and the HOLY GHOST, hath contriv'd a way in which they may be deliver'd from their Sin and Misery. That in order to this, the Eternal SON of GOD hath taken our Nature, and became Man; that He was obedient to Death, the Death of the Cross; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again from the Dead, and lives in Heaven to intercede for his People. Declare to them, that this JESUS is the only Mediator between GOD and Man; and that they must pray to GOD in His Name only. Shew them the necessity of turning from all Sin to GOD in true Repentance; and of receiving the LORD JESUS CHRIST by Faith, and depending on His Righteousness for Pardon and Justification. Declare to them that GOD alone hath power to forgive Sins. Shew them the nature and use of the holy Sacraments, and that those which CHRIST hath instituted are only two, <HI>Baptism</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper;</HI> and la∣bour to maintain in them an high esteem of them. Shew them that they must be taught the Principles of the Christian Religion, and subject themselves to the Authority and Laws of CHRIST, before these may be administred to them: That if they would receive saving benefit by <HI>Baptism,</HI> they must also seek the washing of Regeneration, and renewing of the HOLY GHOST, for themselves and their Offspring, that being born of Water and of the Spirit they may enter into the Kingdom of GOD. Teach them that the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI> must be receiv'd by the Communicants in both Elements, Bread and Wine; and that 'tis contrary to Sense Reason and Scripture, to imagine, that these are turn'd into the very Body and Blood of CHRIST▪ and therefore that CHRIST, who is spiritually present with his People, must be apprehended and received by faith, if they would partake in the saving virtues of his Death. And take heed you never prostitute these Sacred Mysteries of our holy Religion, by administring them to any under Hea∣then Ignorance, under Romish Idolatry, or that live and allow themselves in open and scandalous Immoralities.</P>
<P>Declare to them the Commandments of the <HI>Moral Law.</HI> That GOD only is the Object of Prayer, and all religious Worship. Tell them, forasmuch as we are the Offspring of GOD, we ought not to think that the God-Head is like unto Gold, or Silver or Stone, graven by art, and Man's device: that it is
<PB N="21" REF="003723_0026_10024B3372A4DBE8"/>
a most hainous Crime to worship GOD by Images; and that He who is a jealous GOD, threatens to punish this Iniquity upon Parents and their Children, unto the third and fourth Genera∣tion. Teach them to Sanctify the Sabbath Day; and in a word, the necessity of a sober righteous and godly Life▪ In particular, do all you can to convince them of the great Evil of that Sin which most easily besets them, and to keep them from it; le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they wholly forget GOD's Law, and quench every good motion of His SPIRIT: Solemnly warn them of the Destruction they are bringing upon themselves by it, and how they are consuming away under the deadly influence of it.</P>
<P>[However, I am inform'd that tho' they have a Name for GOD, yet they have no form of taking his Name in vain, in their own Language. Be astonished, O ye Heavens, and be horribly afraid! in that this presumptuous Sin of profane Swearing is so common where the light of the Gospel shines, and GOD's glorious and fearful Name is clearly reveal'd▪ And let such bold Transgressors know, that it will be more tolerable for bar∣barous Indians than for them, in the Day of Judgment; when the LORD shall make it appear, that He <HI>will not hold them guiltless that take his Name in vain.</HI>]</P>
<P>But to return from this Digression; Declare to them, that GOD alone can change their Hearts, enable them to hate Sin, and love his Law; and then direct them to ask of GOD His HOLY SPIRIT, to sanctify them, and create them in CHRIST JESUS unto good Works. And shew them that when they have done all, they must Trust in the Merits of JESUS CHRIST, and not presume to think that they can merit by their good Works. But I forbear.</P>
<P>In your teaching, there must be precept upon precept, line upon line; here a little, and there a little. But how much skill and prudence do you need in this matter? Depend on GOD for all, and encourage your selves in Him, who said on the first Day, <HI>Let there be Light, and there was Light;</HI> and can now more easily shine into their Hearts to give them the knowledge of the Gospel, than you can speak a word. Who hath heard such a thing? Shall a Nation be born at once? Yes, if GOD please, a Nation shall be born in a Day, and Converts be nu∣merous as the drops of Dew from the womb of the Morning. O that this Day of GOD's power might dawn and shine on a World sitting in Darkness! O that the poor Indians might see the light of Life, and live!</P>
<P>But think it not strange, if you meet with sharp Trials from the Prince of Darkness, and such as are under his power, while you are endeavouring to enlighten Men with the know∣ledge of JESUS CHRIST; and be ready to endure hard∣ness,
<PB N="22" REF="003723_0027_10024B368000CF08"/>
as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good Soldiers. Look to GOD continually for all that Knowledge and Wisdom, Faith and Patience, Zeal and Courage, Meekness and Self-denial, which you need; and be cloathed with Humility. Live by Faith and Prayer, and then say with the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>almist,</HI> Psal. cxviii. 6. <HI>The Lord is on my side, I will not fear: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat can man do unto me?</HI> If He be your Sun and Shield, you shall neither want Light nor Protection.</P>
<P>And here, for your further Encouragement, I might propose to your Consideration the <HI>Promises</HI> made to our LORD JESUS CHRIST, who sends his Ministers to open the eyes of Men—. Psal. ii. 8. <HI>Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession.</HI> Isai. liii. 10.—<HI>He shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.</HI> ver. 11. <HI>He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied.</HI> Isai. xlix. 6.—<HI>I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.</HI> Again, Consider, GOD's Hand is not shor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n'd, that it cannot save; and the Sacrifice, by the Blood of which our SAVIOUR hath Redeemed His People out of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People, and Nation, is as full of Virtue as ever; and His Intercession as prevalent for the sending of the HOLY GHOST: so that all that the FATHER hath given Him, shall come unto Him.</P>
<P>I might also for your Encouragement mention the extra∣ordinary Success which the Blessed GOD gave to the Gospel among the Heathen, as we have this transmitted to us from the Records of the Sacred Scriptures. I might also put you in mind of the wonderful Work of GOD, in causing the Light of his Gospel to shine upon our Ancestors in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who before sat in gross Darkness; and then in re∣covering them from the Idolatries of Popery. When we look back on these things, we may well admiring say, What hath GOD wrought! And looking to the hole of the Pit whence we our selves were digged, you may encourage your selves in that GOD, <HI>with whom all things are possible.</HI></P>

<P>However, I need not go so far to fetch Encouragement for you.

Dr. <HI>Cotton Mather'</HI>s Ecclesiastical History of <HI>New-England;</HI> and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Experience Mayhew'</HI>s Indian Converts.</NOTE> And this manifestation of Divine Power and Grace may answer an Objection: You may be ready to think with your selves, How can we go to a Peo∣ple of a strange Speech, and hard Language, who have not the extraordinary Gifts with which the Apostles were furnish∣ed, when they spread the Gospel among the Heathen? Let Experience answer; GOD wonderfully bless'd these excellent Persons in their diligent Endeavours to learn the <HI>Indian Tongue,</HI> and then to communicate Christian Knowledge; so that we behold a considerable number of <HI>Indian Churches</HI> Gather'd, and walking together in the Faith and Order of the Gospel; some furnish'd with <HI>English,</HI> others with <HI>Indian</HI> Pastors. Do you go, and do likewise. May you with like Zeal for the Glory of GOD, and Compassion to Men, lay out your selves in this weighty Affair, and the LORD be with you. And certainly Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Presence, and the Light of His Countenance, are sufficient to brighten the most disconsolate Circumstances of Life. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Paul</HI> could say, <HI>I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. I can do all things through Christ which strengthneth me,</HI> Phil. iii. 11, 13.</P>
<P>And further, consider what a Price is now put into your Hands to serve GOD and your Country? What great and publick Blessings you will be to this People, if the <HI>gracious Presence</HI> of CHRIST with you shall be as a <HI>Wall of Fire</HI> a∣bout us, on our Eastern and Western <HI>Frontiers.</HI> Consider, what a Honour it will be to you, if after all the Blood and Treasure spent in War with these <HI>Salvages,</HI> you must be the Instruments of obtaining the most glorious Victory over them, by subduing them to CHRIST, and the obedience of Faith.

But then, let us not be high minded, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear; and seriously consider what we shall render to the LORD for so great a Benefit; least we treasure up to our selves wrath against the day of Wrath, by despising the Riches of GOD's Goodness. Let us, sensible of the Darkness and Corruption of our Hearts, ask the HOLY SPIRIT to Enlighten and Sanctify us. Let us not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ourselves with an outward Profession, and a Name to live; but earnestly seek a thorough Conversion to GOD, and vital Union with JESUS CHRIST, that we may be found in Him. Let us beseech the LORD to fulfil that pre∣cious Promise to us and our Children. Jer. xxxi. 33. <HI>This shall

be the covenant that I will make with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>use of Israel, After th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be my people.</HI> And let us then walk as Children of the light and day, having no fellowship with the unfruitful Works of Darkness, but rather reproving them. Let us re∣sist the Devil, and he shall flee from us; Watch and Pray le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t this Evil One should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices. And be not conform'd to this World▪ but be ye transformed by the renewing of your Mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and accepta∣ble, and perfect Will of GOD. Thus you may hope to enjoy the light of GOD's Countenance while passing through this World, and shall certainly come to see the good of his Chosen, and to glory with his Inheritance in Heaven. But if after all the Means GOD useth with you, you continue to reject CHRIST, to vex the HOLY SPIRIT, and to walk according to the Course of this World, according to the Spirit which now worketh in the Children of Disobedience; I say unto you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah, in the day of Judgment, than for you, when that Sentence must be pronounced on the Wicked, <HI>Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepar'd for the devil and his angels.</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>I call heaven and earth to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this day against you, that I have s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t before you li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth thou and thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed may live.</HI> Deut. xxx. 19.</P>
<P>To Conclude, Let us continue in Prayer that GOD would pour out his SPIRIT on his servants now to be separated to this great and difficult Work, to Qualify and Strengthen them to the faithful Discharge of it.</P>
<P>Let us Pray that the <HI>Honourable</HI> SOCIETY and their <HI>Commissioners</HI> may at all times <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>joy the Direction and Assistance of GOD.

<P>THE foregoing <HI>Sermon</HI> was both pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceeded and follow∣ed with fervent <HI>Prayer,</HI> suted to the very serious Occasion; wherein the Rev. Mr. <HI>William Cooper</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Webb</HI> were the Mouth of the Audience to GOD;</P>
<P>Dr. <HI>Colman,</HI> who had been chosen <HI>Moderator</HI> by the Reverend and Honourable <HI>Council,</HI> then took the <HI>Desk,</HI> and said,</P>
<P>IT is a rare and singular Occurrence in the Providence of GOD, that hath call'd this Great and Reverend <HI>Assembly</HI> together at this Time. And no doubt but many who are here present may desire to be inform'd of the several Things, occurring in the Providence of a Glorious GOD, which have been the Occasion of our present Meeting. And I think that I cannot better introduce the <HI>Solemn Action</HI> before us, in the <HI>Ordination</HI> of the Reverend and beloved <HI>Brethren</HI> here present, than by giving the following Account.</P>
<Q><P>KNOW then,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See a printed Account of <HI>the Society in Scotland.</HI> 1720.</NOTE> that in the Year of our LORD 1701. a Number of private <HI>Gentlemen</HI> did usually meet in the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> for the Reformation of Manners; who reflecting on the Ignorance, Atheism, Popery and Impiety, that did so much abound in the <HI>High-lands</HI> and <HI>Isles</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> did justly reckon that they flow'd in a great Measure from the Want of sutable Means of Instruction.</P>
<P>THIS led 'em to engage by themselves at first in a volun∣tary Subscription for Erecting <HI>Charity Schools</HI> in those Places of Darkness and Irreligion. But upon Trial finding Them∣selves not able in their private Capacity to carry on so great and publick a Work, they apply'd their Thoughts to find out Methods for a <HI>Fund</HI> equal to the Design.</P>
<P>IN pursuance of this they mov'd it privately to Members of the <HI>General Assembly,</HI> that the Representatives of <HI>the Church of Scotland</HI> might concur in the Work. And they had so much Success that in the Year 1706. the <HI>General Assembly</HI> took it under Consideration, and recommended it to their <HI>Commission,</HI> who published <HI>Proposals for the Propagating of Christian Knowledge</HI> in their High-lands and Isles, and also in Foreign Parts.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="003723_0033_10024B4408CAFDE8"/>
THESE <HI>Proposals</HI> we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sent to all the <HI>Presbyteries in Scotland,</HI> and to the several <HI>Societies</HI> there <HI>for Reformation of Manners:</HI> And in the Year 1708, Application being made to <HI>Her Majesty, Queen</HI> ANN, to countenance and support the Design by Her <HI>Royal</HI> Authority; it pleas'd <HI>Her Majesty,</HI> with the Advice of Her <HI>Privy Council</HI> to approve and recommend this most pious and charitable Design, and to grant Her <HI>Letters Patents</HI> for Erecting the <HI>Subscribers</HI> into a Society and <HI>Corporation</HI> for managing the same.</P></Q>
<P>PERSONS of the highest <HI>Dignity</HI> in the Nation, both <HI>Dukes</HI> and <HI>Earls,</HI> stand at the Head of this Commission; with a long Train of <HI>Names</HI> of known Honour and Merit, and of distinguish∣ing Character for Piety and Religion.</P>
<Q><P>THE first Subscription was somewhat above <HI>One Thousand Pounds Sterl.</HI> which within <HI>twelve Years</HI> increased to above <HI>Eight Thousand:</HI> So that a vast Number of <HI>Charity Schools</HI> have been erected and are now supported by the Honourable <HI>Society:</HI> And they have their <HI>Corresponding Members</HI> at <HI>London, Dublin, Bris<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> and now lately here in <HI>New England.</HI> For they are expresly impower'd by the <HI>Letters Patents</HI> erecting them into a Society, to nominate fit Persons in any Place of <HI>His Majesty's</HI> Dominions, or elsewhere, for laying our such Sums as They are intrusted with.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY the Honourable <HI>Society</HI> being unanimously resolved to imploy several <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel, as their <HI>Missionaries</HI> for the Conversion of Infidel Foreign Countries, chose to make the poor <HI>Heathen People about New England</HI> the first Objects of their Care; to bring them to the Knowledge of GOD in CHRIST.</P>
<P>To which End They did on the twenty ninth Day of <HI>April</HI> 1731. at a General Meeting nominate, commissionate and impower His Excellency <HI>Jonathan Belcher</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> with other Honourable and Reverend <HI>Persons,</HI> to be their <HI>Correspondents</HI> and Commissioners: And the first Thing they are Entrusted with is to pursue the excellent <HI>Design</HI> of the late Reverend and Charitable Dr. <HI>Daniel Williams</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> in his pious Mortification of an Estate of <HI>Fifty Six Pounds Sterling per Annum,</HI> to the Society; toward the Support of <HI>three qua∣lified Missionaries,</HI> to labour in the Conversion of the poor perishing <HI>Natives</HI> on our Borders.</P></Q>
<P><HI>HIS Excellency</HI> in his great Wisdom, upon the Receipt of these <HI>Letters,</HI> laid the Matter before the Honourable <HI>General Court</HI> then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itting, who readily testified their high Approbation
<PB N="29" REF="003723_0034_10024B48569CE8F0"/>
of the proposed <HI>Mission,</HI> by granting an Additional Honourable Support to <HI>each</HI> of the Missionary's for five Years.</P>
<P>ALSO He was pleas'd to write to the <HI>Society,</HI> who have printed His <HI>Excellency'</HI>s Letter,</P>
<Q><P>THAT He had receiv'd Their <HI>Commission,</HI> and did accept of being a Correspondent Member; that He gives Praise to GOD who inspired the Founders of this excellent Charity to Souls: And that as the KING has made Him the Head and Father of this Part of His Dominions, He therefore return'd Thanks to the <HI>Society</HI> in behalf of the poor <HI>Natives</HI> of the Country: And that the <HI>Society</HI> might depend on the united Endeavours of their <HI>Correspondent Members</HI> here, to do all the good Service they can in this pious Undertaking, &amp;c.</P></Q>
<P>THE <HI>Commissioners,</HI> under this Influence and Encouragement, set themselves to find <HI>Persons</HI> qualified and inclin'd to under∣take a Mission of such Weight and Importance: and through the good Hand of GOD with them there willingly offer'd Themselves, upon the Motion made to them, Mr. <HI>Stephen Parker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Hinsdel,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Joseph Secomb;</HI> who have been already Ministring in the Places assigned them more than a Year.</P>
<P>AND now at the Call of the <HI>Commissioners,</HI> by Direction from the <HI>Honourable Society,</HI> whose They are under CHRIST, for the glorious Ends proposed; They do this Day here pre∣sent Themselves before the LORD and his People, in His Fear and with a Reliance on his Grace which is A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>suffici∣ent; to take on them <HI>this Ministry among the Heathen;</HI> weighty difficult and awful as it is in it self, but most honourable in the Kingdom of our LORD JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>AND a Number of the Reverend <HI>Pastors of the Town,</HI> hav∣ing received from the before named <HI>Missionaries</HI> a satisfying Declaration of their Adherence to the Principles of Religion, as they are contained in the <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> and exhibited in the <HI>Assembly's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> are here present to commend Them by <HI>Prayer,</HI> with <HI>Imposition of Hands,</HI> to the Grace and Blessing of GOD.</P>
<P>THE Reverend <HI>Elders</HI> and <HI>Messengers</HI> of the Churches, con∣ven'd in <HI>Council</HI> on this Occasion, do by their Presence suffici∣ently declare their Consent unto and Approbation of the <HI>Or∣dination</HI> that is before us: And if there are any in the Assembly, that have any thing to <HI>object</HI> against our proceeding in the holy Action before us; either as to the <HI>Doctrine, Principles, Life</HI> and <HI>Conversation</HI> of the before named Mr. <HI>Stephen Parker,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Hinsdel</HI> and Mr. <HI>Joseph Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mb,</HI> they are called upon to declare the same.—</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="003723_0035_10024B49F41413B8"/>
No <HI>Objection</HI> being made, it remains only to address my Self to <HI>You</HI> my dearly beloved <HI>Brethren</HI> and honoured in the LORD: For the LORD JESUS highly honours You before his Peo∣ple, in this extraordinary <HI>Call</HI> He gives You <HI>to bear his Name unto the Heathen;</HI> and therein to do the Work of <HI>Evangelists</HI> (in part at least) by his Grace in you and with you.</P>
<P>"<HI>DO You therefore now in the Presence of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>and before this Assembly as the</HI> LORD's <HI>Witnesses; before</HI> GOD <HI>Angels and Men, willingly and freely, with Humility and Fear, offer your Selves first unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>and then to the service of Souls; as in the Work of the Ministry in general, so in a particular manner in that Mission to which you esteem your selves called of</HI> GOD, <HI>by His special and singular Providence, to carry the Gospel among the Heathen in our Borders? And will you, by His Grace, so long as GOD continues you the Opportunity, humbly, diligently, faithfully apply your selves to this Work of the</HI> LORD, <HI>as Those that must give an Account?</HI>"</P>
<P>THE <HI>Missionaries</HI> in a very serious manner signifying their <HI>Submission and Consent</HI> to this very <HI>awful Promise</HI> and <HI>Vow;</HI> the <HI>Moderator</HI> told them that the Length of the Exercise, and the Coldness of the Season prevented Him from repeating to Them, on this publick Occasion, some of those <HI>Instructions</HI> which they had received from our <HI>Honourable Constituents;</HI> which as he doubted not they had often and seriously considered, so he had thought to have received from them their public Con∣sent to the same as in the Presence of CHRIST.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>Instructions</HI> are as follow.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Commission and Instructions to the Missionaries in</HI> New-England.</NOTE> <Q>You are to in∣struct the <HI>Heathen</HI> People, as GOD gives you Opportunity, in the Principles of the Christian, Reformed, Protestant Re∣ligion: And in order thereunto, not only to preach and catechize, but also to school and teach them to read the Holy Scriptures of the <HI>Old and New Testament,</HI> and other good and pious Books<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Supposed that they will be prevail'd on to learn.</HI></NOTE>. You are also to teach them Wri∣ting and Arithmetick, and to understand and speak the Eng∣lish Language. You are especially to direct them how to pray, and to carry as becometh the Gospel. And when you shall judge them fit to receive the Seals of the Covenant of Grace, you are to administer the same unto them; and use your best Endeavours to confirm such in the Truths of our Holy Religion, and to engage them to persevere therein.</Q></P>
<Q><PB N="31" REF="003723_0036_10024B4D2BFFB7B8"/>
<P>IN all this<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Letters of Instruction to Missionaries.</HI></NOTE> you are to act conscienciously, depending on GOD for Counsel, Strength, Furniture, and Success. Let the Glory of GOD, and the Salvation of precious <HI>Souls</HI> be your chief Motive. You are employ'd on a very impor∣tant and glorious Work, and will much want the Help of the SPIRIT OF GOD therein. Remember your <HI>Blessed</HI> REDEEMER's Instruction to his <HI>Disciples,</HI> Matth. x. 16. <HI>Behold, I send you forth as Sheep in the midst of Wolves; be ye therefore wise as Serpents, and harmless of Doves.</HI></P>
<P>YOU must look for Difficulties and Discouragements, and therefore study Patience, Self-denial, Humility, Forbearance; and carry with all Meekness and Love toward those with whom you have to do. Let your Deportment and Manage∣ment be such, as they may see that you seek their Good; and take the most gaining Methods with them.</P></Q>
<P><Q>YOU are also frequently to report an Account of your Diligence and Success, to the <HI>Societies Correspondents</HI> here.</Q> But your great Care must be to approve your selves to GOD, who sees and tries the Heart, and to WHOM you must give an Account. And GOD make you those <HI>faithful and wise Servants</HI> who shall do it <HI>with Joy and not with Grief.</HI> In the <HI>Hope</HI> whereof we shall now immediately proceed <HI>to lay our Hands upon You,</HI> according to the Direction of the Gospel, and <HI>to pray over you in the Name of the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Moderator</HI> then left the Desk, and the <HI>Ministers</HI> came down to the Seat prepared for the <HI>Candidates</HI> before the Pulpit, and about <HI>Ten</HI> of the <HI>Pastors</HI> present laying on Hands, the Moderator <HI>pray'd,</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>GIVING Glory</HI> to the Supream and Immense JEHOVAH, the LORD OF HOSTS sitting upon a Throne high and lifted up, and his Train filling the Temple! Who walks in the midst of the golden Candlesticks, and holds the Stars in his right Hand! Whose Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, and He will make the Churches to know that He searches the Hearts and the Reins.</P>
<P>ADORING HIM <HI>in the Condescentions of his Grace</HI> that His Tabernacle is with Men on Earth, and that we have seen the Goings of our GOD and King in his Sanctuary! while Seraphims are covering their Faces before Him, and crying One to Another, Holy, Holy, Holy is the LORD OF HOSTS! And while We are of unclean Lips, and dwell among a People of unclean Lips.</P>
<P>SUPPLICATION <HI>was then made</HI> for Pardon and Cleansing thro' the Sacrifice of CHRIST, which is for the Priest∣hood and the Congregation; that the LORD would send
<PB N="32" REF="003723_0037_10024B4F95361590"/>
his Angel as with a live Coal from his Altar, to touch our Hearts and Lips to take away Iniquity and purge away Sin! that if then the LORD's Voice come to us, saying, Whom shall I send? and who will go for Us▪ our purified Hearts might readily answer, Here am I, send me!</P>
<P>THANKSGIVING <HI>was then render'd to</HI> GOD, that He has a Church in the World, bought with his Blood, to be sanctified and cleansed with the washing of Water, by the Word! and for a glorious SAVIOUR, Head over all things to the Church, who is ascended on High and has received Gifts for Men even for the rebellious, that the LORD GOD might dwell among us! and has given Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers, for the Work of the Ministry and the Edifying his Body! that He has set up his Kingdom among us, shewn us his Covenant, made known to us his holy Sabbaths, and committed to us the Ministry of Reconciliation! that He has appointed and is calling from Age to Age an Order of Men to Minister in holy Things whom he sends to disciple all Nations bap∣tizing them in the Name of the FATHER and of the SON and of the HOLY GHOST, teaching them to ob∣serve all Things whatsoever He has commanded, with whom He has promis'd to be always even to the End of the World.</P></Q>
<P>MORE <HI>particularly</HI> <Q>CHRIST JESUS OUR LORD was thanked that He was pleas'd to be now putting into the Ministry these his Servants who were now presenting Themselves before the LORD and his People, to give Themselves first unto the LORD, and then to the Service of Souls by his holy Will.</Q></P>
<P>PRAYERS <HI>were therefore pour'd out to</HI> GOD <HI>for Them,</HI> <Q>that He would please to call them effectually by his Grace, and to reveal his SON in them, that they may preach Him among the Heathen, as well as in the Churches of the Saints, not conferring with Flesh and Blood; but ac∣counting it a distinguishing Honour, that unto Them (the least of all Saints) this Grace should be given, to preach among the Heathen the unsearchable Riches of CHRIST.</Q></P>
<Q><P>THAT the Grace of our LORD JESUS CHRIST might be therefore exceeding abundant to Them, with Faith and Love, to enable them to encounter and surmount the Difficulties of this Mission; that it may appear they are chosen Vessels to the LORD, to bear his Name before the Gentiles: And that GOD would shew them how great Things he will do for them and by them, if by their Ministry the Heathenish People may be Fellow-Heirs and of the same Body with us; Worshipping the true and living GOD in Spirit and in Truth, and in the Name of the One MEDIATOR between GOD and Man, the Man CHRIST JESUS, who is GOD over all, blessed for ever!
<PB N="33" REF="003723_0038_10024B520A9C6288"/>
No longer serving dumb Idols as they have been led, nor worshipping Angels and Saints that are no Mediators.</P>
<P>THAT a wide and effectual Door may be opened to them, by the Power of the HOLY GHOST, who once said—Separate Me <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI> for the Work unto which I have called them: That this Manner of Entring in unto the Heathen may be granted them, to turn unto GOD from Idols, and to wait for his SON from Heaven! to turn them from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto GOD; that they may receive the Forgiveness of Sin and an Inheritance among all them that are sanctified.</P>
<P>THAT the Gospel may be preached by them with the HOLY GHOST sent down from Heaven, and be the Power of GOD unto the Salvation of many Souls; as it is unto all them that believe, both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians, to the wise and to the unwise; for therein is the Righteousness of GOD revealed from Faith to Faith.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE according to the Direction of the HOLY WORD we humbly laid our Hands on them in the Name of the GOD of all Grace, as His devoted Servants; sepa∣rating them to his special Service in the Work of the Mi∣nistry, imploring the ETERNAL SPIRIT to descend and rest on them, to enlighten them in his Truth, to spirit 'em for his Service, to be in them the Spirit of Grace and Suppli∣cation; to assist, support, comfort and succeed them in his Work: to furnish 'em abundantly with Ministerial Gifts and Graces, to direct 'em in their Holy Studies, to assist them in their publick Administrations; to inspire them with pure Aims and fervent Zeal for his Glory, and with tender Com∣passion to precious Souls; to make 'em able and faithful Ministers of the New Testament, wise to Salvation, and wise to win Souls; And that the Blood of HIM, who thro' the ETERNAL SPIRIT, offer'd up Himself without Spot to GOD, may purge their Consciences from dead Works, to serve the living GOD in Righteousness and Holiness before Him, all the Days of their Life.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Prayer</HI> being ended the CHARGE was given in the fol∣lowing Words.</P>
<Q><P>HAVING pray'd over You in the Name of the LORD, commended you to His Grace, and separated you to his spe∣cial Service in the Work of the Ministry; We do in His Name declare you to be <HI>Authorized Ministers of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>we charge you</HI> before GOD and the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his Appearing and Kingdom: Preach the Word; be instant in Season and out of Season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with

<P>For, if we review the <HI>State of Mankind</HI> at our Blessed SA∣VIOUR's <HI>Ascension;</HI> we shall see that almost the whole World were perishing in <HI>Ignorance</HI> of the Way of Salvation, and un∣der the deluding Power of <HI>Satan,</HI> who led them captive at his destructive Pleasure.

<P>In the <HI>Propagation</HI> therefore of this <HI>Kingdom,</HI> there were these <HI>Two</HI> things to be done; that it might be thus <HI>extended</HI> and <HI>continued:</HI> (1) The <HI>Gospel</HI> must be <HI>Preached</HI> among the <HI>Ignorant,</HI> both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles;</HI> that they might be turned from Dark∣ness to Light, and from the Power of <HI>Satan</HI> to GOD, and so receive the Forgiveness of their Sins and an Inheritance a∣mong the Sanctified through Faith in CHRIST: (2) These <HI>enlightened Converts</HI> were to be gathered into Particular <HI>Congre∣gations</HI> or <HI>Churches,</HI> for their own further Edification and Perse∣verance, and the more sure Transmission of this happy Kingdom to their Successors.</P>

<P>Of the <HI>former</HI> sort of Officers were the APOSTLES, and EVAN∣GELISTS: of the <HI>latter</HI> sort were the BISHOPS, that is, in the plain, ancient sense of the Word, the OVERSEERS or ELD<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>RS of particular Churches, who were to take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Charge of the <HI>Spiritual</HI> Part; besides the DEACONS, who were to take the Charge of the <HI>Secular.</HI></P>
<P>The peculiar Character of the Twelve APOST<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>S, was to be the <HI>Eye-witnesses</HI> of a <HI>Risen</HI> JESUS,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> i. 21, 22.</NOTE> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> They had a Power to prove by working Miracles.

<P>But inasmuch as it was impossible, that <HI>Twelve</HI> Men should be sufficient to Preach the Gospel and Gather Churches in every Town or City of every Country; therefore both the <HI>Necessity</HI> of <HI>Mankind</HI> and the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of CHRIST required, that <HI>Others</HI> duly qualified, should be added to them, in their great Business of the Propagation of the Gospel among the Nations: and for <HI>this End</HI> therefore, were employed <HI>Others,</HI> who were distinguished from them by the Name EVANG<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>LISTS.</P>

But by EVANGELISTS were especially meant, <HI>that sort</HI> of <HI>Spiritual officers,</HI> whose Business was the same with the <HI>gene∣ral Part</HI> of the APOSTLES <HI>Office;</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the EVANGELIZING the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles;</HI> i. e. the <HI>Preaching</HI> the Gospel to them, the labouring by all proper means for their Conversion, <HI>Gather∣ing Churches</HI> among them, and <HI>Committing the Care</HI> of those ga∣thered Churches to well qualified <HI>Overseers</HI> or <HI>Elders.</HI></P>
<P>Such an EVANGELIST was not only MARK, the Writer of the Gospel that bares his Name; who was a <HI>Preacher</HI> of the Gospel also among the Gentiles; as both the <HI>New Testament</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> xil. 25 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. 37,—39. <HI>Col.</HI> iv. 10. <HI>Philem.</HI> 24.</NOTE> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> have inform'd us.</P>
<P>But such an EVANGELIST was PHILIP likewise: Who was at first one of the seven <HI>Deacons</HI> chosen by the <HI>Brethren</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to take care of the <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>That they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and ordain'd to</HI> Take care of the Poor; <HI>both the</HI> HOLY SCRIPTURES <HI>inform us,</HI> Acts vi. 1,—6, <HI>and</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>also expresly assures us, in his</HI> Eccl.

Chap.</HI> 29.</NOTE> But upon that Church being dispersed by the Persecution at the Death of <HI>Stephen;</HI> there being no further occasion for his attending his Deacon's Office, and being full of the Holy Ghost and duly qualified; He becomes an EVANGELIST: and <HI>such a one</HI> He is expresly called, <HI>Acts</HI> xxi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Such EVANGELISTS were great NUMBERS OF OTHERS of <HI>that Church</HI> also; which were by the same Persecution disper∣sed abroad: as we read in Act, viii. 1. <HI>At that time there was a great Persecution against the Church which was at</HI> Jerusalem: <HI>and they were</HI> all Scattered abroad, <HI>throughout the Regions of</HI> Judea <HI>and</HI> Samaria, <HI>except the</HI> APOSTLES: ver. 4. <HI>Therefore</HI> They that were Scattered abroad, <HI>went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where</HI> Preaching the Word: and ver. 5. <HI>Then</HI> PHILIP <HI>went down to the City of</HI> Samaria, <HI>and</HI> Preached <HI>CHRIST unto them.</HI> For that this was not <HI>Philip</HI> of the <HI>twelve Apostles,</HI> but the same that was before the Dispersion, a <HI>Deacon,</HI> is plain, by comparing the vi, viii, &amp; xxi. <HI>Chapters</HI> of the <HI>Acts</HI> together.</P>
<P>Such an EVANGELIST was TIMOTHY: as appears most plain∣ly from a great Number of <HI>Scripture Passages</HI> concerning Him; wherein we find that He went <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: and Preached the Gospel both to the <HI>Ephesians</HI> and <HI>Colossi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns</HI> in ASIA, and to the <HI>Thes∣salonians</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in EUROPE.

To <HI>Watch in all things,</HI> to DO THE WORK OF AN EVANGE∣LIST, and (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>) <HI>Fulfil</HI> his <HI>Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>Such an EVANGELIST was TITUS: as fully appears from 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> viii. 6, 23. <HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 3. 2 Tim. iv. 10. and from the <HI>Epistle</HI> of the same <HI>Apostle</HI> to Him, compared together.</P>
<P>In short, such EVANGELISTS were BARNABAS and SILAS, APOLLOS and SYLVANUS; as appears from <HI>so many Scriptures</HI> as the Time will not allow me to mention: and 'tis likely MANY OTHERS named in the <HI>New Testament,</HI> whom the <HI>Apostle</HI> PAUL calls HIS FELLOW-LABOURERS—had we Leisure to enquire into their History.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this, the <HI>same Apostle,</HI> speaking of our Blessed SAVIOUR, says Eph. iv. 8,—12. <HI>When He ascended up on High, He led Captivity Captive, and gave</HI> Gifts <HI>to Men: and he gave some</HI> Apostles, <HI>and some</HI> Prophets, <HI>and some</HI> EVANGELISTS, <HI>and some</HI> Pastors <HI>and</HI> Teachers; <HI>for the Perfecting of the Saints,</HI> (i. e. the compleating their NUMBER<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>So</HI> Vatablus <HI>in</HI> Pol. <HI>Synops.</HI></NOTE>) <HI>for the Work of the Ministry, for the Edifying of the Body of</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P>And agreeable to all this also, <HI>Eusebius</HI> not only calls MARK,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eccl. Hist. <HI>Book II.

<P>In Book II. <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. He has these remarkable Passages—

—And in the <HI>close</HI> of the <HI>Chapter</HI>—
<Q REND="margQuotes">It being impossible to recount by name, <HI>all Those,</HI> who in the <HI>First</HI> SUCCESSION of the APOSTLES, were PASTORS or EVANGELISTS in the Churches throughout the World.</Q></P>
<P>By PASTORS He plainly means the <HI>stated Overseers</HI> or <HI>Elders</HI> of the Churches gathered: and by EVANGELISTS, Those who <HI>First Evangeliz'd</HI> and gathered them into Churches.</P>
<P>Not but that the <HI>One</HI> sort of Officers might be changed into the <HI>Other,</HI> as the Occasion of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of CHRIST re∣quired. For the KINGDOM of CHRIST could not be made for <HI>these Officers,</HI> but <HI>They</HI> for <HI>this</HI> KINGDOM: and therefore just according to the Demands of this <HI>Kingdom,</HI> They might be set up, remov'd, or continued in one Place or other, or reciprocally change their Offices. Thus, upon the Dispersion of particular Churches, or other weighty Occasions, whereby the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of CHRIST might be the more advanced, the <HI>stated Pastors</HI> of those Churches might become <HI>Evangelists,</HI> to Preach the Gospel and gather Churches in other Places. And so, the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> thro' Age, Infirmity, or the weighty Occasions of particular Churches, might become the <HI>stated Pastors</HI> of one of the Churches They had Gathered, or of any other.</P>
<P>From all these <HI>Premises,</HI> we may fairly draw these three CORROLARIES—</P>
<P N="1">(1) That 'tis therefore a great <HI>Mistake,</HI> which the Generality of Learned Men have inadvertently fallen into; in <HI>supposing</HI> that EVANGELISTS, or Ministers to Preach the Gospel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gather Churches among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> were an extraordinary sort of Officers, peculiar to the Primitive Ages.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="003723_0047_10024B65EF6E5D50"/>
<HI>They</HI> were extraordinary Men indeed in those ancient Times, and had <HI>extraordinary Gifts:</HI> and so had the DEACONS also, as those Times required. But as <HI>meer Evangelists,</HI> they were no otherwise extraordinary than the <HI>Occasions</HI> of their Of∣fice. That is, so long as there are <HI>Heathens</HI> to be E∣vangelized, to be Converted to the Christian Faith, to be Baptiz'd and gathered into Churches; so long do both the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of CHRIST and <HI>Necessities</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> require the Office, as well as in the primitive Times; and so long do they call aloud for Persons duly qualified and spirited to be engaged in it, until <HI>all the Nations</HI> are Converted and gathered into Churches: and then indeed the <HI>End</HI> of their Office ceasing, the <HI>Office</HI> will therefore fail, and no other Spiritual Officers remain but the <HI>Stated Pastors</HI> of particular Churches.</P>
<P>And the <HI>contrary narrow Conception,</HI> laying aside <HI>those Evangelical Officers</HI> and confining the <HI>Christian Ministry</HI> to the <HI>Pastors</HI> or <HI>Elders</HI> of <HI>Particular Churches,</HI> has not only a plain natural Ten∣dency to hinder; but has also doubtless been a principal Mean of hindering the Propagation of the Gospel thro' the World. To this it seems in a great measure owing, that the <HI>Religion of</HI> CHRIST has not made a much farther Pro∣gress in the <HI>Eastern Hemisphere,</HI> than it had about 1400 Years ago, in the Days of CONSTANTINE the <HI>Great.</HI> Whereas had <HI>this Order of Ministers,</HI> from those ancient Times been con∣stantly kept up and emitted among the <HI>Heathen Nations;</HI> by the common Blessing of Heaven, it seems to be likely, that <HI>all the Ends of the Earth,</HI> in a far more extensive Sense than <HI>Eu∣sebius</HI> is to be taken, had long before now been <HI>Evangeliz'd,</HI> and happily seen the Salvation of GOD.</P>
<P>Nor can I imagine, that the Reformed and famous <HI>Churches,</HI> either of FRANCE or SCOTLAND ever intended to militate <HI>this sort of Officers</HI> thus described: For tho' They discountenance a <HI>Vagous Ministry</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Quick's <HI>Synodicon, &amp;</HI> Steuart's <HI>Collections</HI></NOTE>; I presume they only mean in <HI>those Parts of the World,</HI> where the People are <HI>Christianized</HI> and <HI>Churches</HI> gathered.</P>
<P N="2">(2) From hence we likewise plainly see, that EVANGELISTS, or Preachers of the Gospel and Gatherers of Churches among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> are <HI>much more properly and strictly,</HI> the SUCCESSORS of the APOSTLES, than the <HI>stated Bishops</HI> or <HI>Elders</HI> of particu∣lar Churches: the Office of the <HI>former</HI> much more resembling that of the APOSTLES, than the Office of the <HI>latter.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="43" REF="003723_0048_10024B6923EF5358"/>
(3) and lastly, These EVANGELISTS thus Preaching among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> Converting and Baptizing them, Gathering them into Churches and then Constituting <HI>stated Bishops</HI> or <HI>Elders</HI> over them; They, the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> cannot therefore possibly be an Inferiour Order of Officers to those <HI>Stated Bishops</HI> or <HI>Elders</HI> whom▪ They thus set over the Churches▪ They have con∣verted and gathered. Tho' their Ordaining such <HI>Bishops</HI> or <HI>Elders</HI> will on the other hand no more infer a Superiority in the <HI>Evangelists;</HI> than <HI>one Stated Bishop</HI> of a Church ordain∣ing <HI>another Bishop,</HI> will infer a Superiority in the <HI>Ordainer.</HI></P>
<P>And for your farther Satisfaction in the strict Propriety of <HI>Laying our Hands</HI> upon, and <HI>Giving the Right Hand of Fellow∣ship</HI> to <HI>such sort of Officers</HI> as have been now ordained; I shall only observe these Two things—</P>
<P N="1">(1) That they were <HI>such sort of Officers,</HI> upon whom HANDS WERE LAID in the primitive Times, when they were separated to this peculiar Service.</P>
<P>Thus we read of BARNABAS an EVANGELIST, as well as of PAUL an APOSTLE, in <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 1,—3. <HI>Now there were in the Church that was at</HI> Antioch, <HI>certain Prophets and Teachers</HI>—<HI>as they ministred to the</HI> LORD, <HI>and fasted, the</HI> HOLY GHOST <HI>said,</HI> SEPARATE <HI>me</HI> BARNABAS <HI>and</HI> SAUL <HI>for the Work whereto I have called them: and when they had fasted and prayed, and</HI> LAID THEIR HANDS <HI>on them, they sent them away.</HI> And so were the <HI>Hands of the Presbytery</HI> laid on TIMOTHY, another EVANGELIST, when the <HI>Gift</HI> of Preaching the Gospel, which was at first among the <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Heathen,</HI> was communicated to Him. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 14.</P>
<P N="2">(2) That they were also <HI>such sort of Officers,</HI> to whom the <HI>Apostles</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> gave the RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP; when they were going to Preach among the <HI>Heathen.</HI></P>
<P>So the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> himself assures us, in <HI>Gal.</HI> iii. 9. <HI>And when</HI> JAMES, CEPHAS <HI>and</HI> JOHN, <HI>who seemed to be</HI> PILLARS, <HI>perceived the Grace that was given to</HI> ME; <HI>they gave to</HI> ME <HI>and</HI> BARNABAS <HI>the</HI> RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP; <HI>that</HI> WE <HI>should go to the</HI> HEATHEN <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And thus we see that the <HI>Scripture Instances</HI> both of <HI>Imposition of Hands</HI> and Giving the <HI>Right Hand of Fellowship,</HI> are <HI>firstly</HI> in Favour of <HI>Such sort</HI> of Officers; and are by <HI>Inference</HI> or <HI>Imi∣tation</HI> only, applied to <HI>Others.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="003723_0049_10024B6C68EC5180"/>
But how extreamly <HI>agreable</HI> is the <HI>last mention'd</HI> primitive INSTANCE, to the <HI>Case before us!</HI></P>
<P>For besides, that those <HI>Five</HI> Ministers were then at JERUSA∣LEM, the <HI>Seat</HI> of the principal Christian Church in that Age and Part of the World; from whence were <HI>Ministers</HI> sent con∣tinually to Preach the Gospel and gather Churches in all the Countries round about:—What I would chiefly observe is—(1) That this was done upon their <HI>Perceiving the</HI> GRACE <HI>of</HI> GOD given to <HI>Paul</HI> as well as <HI>Barnabas</HI>—i. e. not only the Ministerial Gifts and Graces of the HOLY SPIRIT, but also their evident Call of GOD to engage in this Office, and their un∣questionable Investiture therein. (2) That this was done at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>arting of these Christian Ministers; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> among the GENTILES, while the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ministers were to continue to Preach among the <HI>Jews.</HI> (3) That tho' they were all invested equally with the Mini∣sterial Office; yet now at their Parting, <HI>Those</HI> who were <HI>Prior</HI> in the Ministry and <HI>seem'd to be</HI> PILLARS; i. e. were so con∣spicuous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Christian Church, as they were every where known and own'd as <HI>Ministers</HI> of CHRIST, and were also to remain among the <HI>Jews,</HI> if not in or near <HI>Jerusalem</HI>—were tho't most proper to <HI>Give</HI> the <HI>Right Hand of Fellowship</HI> to Those who were going to a greater Distance and among another People.</P>
<P>And from these Observables we may now easily collect the singular INTENTION of these wise and inspired Ministers in <HI>this Significant Action.</HI> For no doubt They meant thereby—(1) To testify their Approbation of them as <HI>true Ministers</HI> of CHRIST, both duly qualified for this Sacred Office, rightly called to it, and invested and employed in it; that all might own them as such, and none dispute their Ministerial Power. (2) To signify, that tho' they were now to Part; yet They were <HI>still United</HI> in the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Affection and in the same Design, embarqued in the same Holy Cause of CHRIST, and were to Propagate the same pure Religion in different Places. (3) To signify their <HI>continued Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n</HI> for each other, with their hearty Readiness and Resolution to assist each other, both by constant Prayers, Advices and Endeavours, as there might be Occasion. (4) and lastly, to exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> therewith, their earnest <HI>Recommendation</HI> of Them to the <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD, that they might be greatly assisted and prospered in their Ministry.</P>

<Q>In <HI>Imitation</HI> of these agreable EXAMPLES, in the midst of this <HI>Metropolis,</HI> at the Desire and in the Name of the <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Deleg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s</HI> of the <HI>Churches</HI> here Convened, and in the Sight of this great Assembly,</Q></P>
<P>I Do therefore,</P>
<P><HI>Dear and Reverend Brethren!</HI></P>
<Q><P>At your Parting from us, to carry the Gospel among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> now <HI>Give you heartily the</HI> RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP.—And it is <HI>to Signify</HI>—Our Approbation of You as <HI>true Ministers</HI> of CHRIST; furnished for this Sacred Office, rightly called to it, and fully invested in all the Powers and Authorities of it, wherever the Affairs of His <HI>Kingdom</HI> may call you, and now especially for the Propagation of it among the <HI>Heathen:</HI>—That we account you still to be <HI>United with us</HI> in the same General and great Design and Interest of our common LORD; to carry on that happy <HI>Kingdom</HI> in the World, which con∣sisteth not in carnal Ordinances impos'd on Men, but in <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> and the <HI>Joy</HI> of the HOLY GHOST:—That we shall be continually <HI>concerned for You,</HI> mindful of You in Prayer, and be ready to assist You as Occa∣sion requires.—And finally, We <HI>commend You to the</HI> GRACE <HI>of our</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST: That He would fill You with His SPIRIT: Inspire You with Light and Zeal; supply you with Faith and Patience, Courage, Wis∣dom, Self-Denial, Meekness, and Humility; Touch You with the most tender and condescending Pity for those wretched <HI>Natives;</HI> Excite You to Your Duty, guide You in Your Work, defend You from every Evil, suppor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and comfort You in all your Trials; and prosper Your Endeavours for the Advancement of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of our Blessed LORD, in the Salvation of many Sinners perishing in Ignorance and Wickedness.</P>
<P>May Your Eyes be always to <HI>Him,</HI> Your Dependance always on <HI>Him,</HI> and His mighty Grace be sufficient for You. May You from <HI>Him</HI> give <HI>Light</HI> to them that sit in Darkness and in the Regions of the Shadow of Death, to guide their Feet into the Way of Eternal Peace and Blessedness: May You faithfully discharge the Office of the EVANGELISTS of CHRIST among them: and from Preaching the Glad Tydings of Salvation to them on <HI>Earth,</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="003723_0051_10024B6FA8C38430"/>
may You at length ascend the <HI>World above,</HI> and carry the News of their Conversion thither; to highten the Joy of the <HI>Heavenly Hosts,</HI> and increase the Praise of our Great REDEEMER. <HI>Amen.</HI></P></Q>
