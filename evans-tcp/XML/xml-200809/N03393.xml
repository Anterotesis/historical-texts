<HEAD>To the Old or First Church in <HI>BOSTON.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly Beloved,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was a sincere and high Respect for the Memory of my Reverend <HI>Father,</HI> your late excellent <HI>Pastor,</HI> to∣gether with a View to your Edification, which indu∣ced me to entertain you, in my publick Discourse on the Sabbath after his Funeral, with some Meditations suit∣ed to the mournful Occasion of his Death: and I doubt not, the same Principles had their Influence in putting You upon so unanimous a <HI>Vote,</HI> to ask a Copy for the Press.</P>
<P>I need not observe to You, with what Disadvantages a Performance of this Nature from me (under my present In∣dispositions) must appear; while the necessary Care of my broken Health forbids that Application of Thought and Care of Exactness, proper in preparing and publishing a Sermon on such a Subject and Occasion: which would have suffici∣ently pleaded in my Excuse, if I had declin'd the Press. However, in Deference to your Judgment and Request, I have sacrific'd my own Inclinations; and venture into the publick Light, hoping for the same Candour to an imperfect Discourse from others in the reading, as it met with from You in the hearing. It must be allow'd, that an affected Niceness of Method and Ornaments of Language make but an odd Figure in a melancholy Funeral Sermon: and therefore I give you mine very much in its original inaccu∣rate Dress; tho' with some few Additions, which the scant Limits of a single Hour obliged me to omit in the Pulpit.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="004140_0004_1003DAEC670CB828"/>As to the <HI>Character</HI> of the Deceased, so far as I went into it, 'tis a Satisfaction to me, that I have your Concur∣rence: for the World must think your printing the Sermon a loud Attestation to the Justice of my Observations on that head. I spake indeed with the greater Freedom, because in <HI>your</HI> hearing, who could witness I spoke <HI>in the Words of Truth and Soberness.</HI></P>
<P>It was the known Principle and Practice of the deceased Servant of God to use a remarkable Caution and Modesty of Speech an such Occasions; nor could he relish the flow'ry Pomp of <HI>Funeral Oratory,</HI> so common, and so often abus'd, in praising the Dead, to flatter the Living: Yet where any appear'd to him Persons of distinguish'd Merits, and such as by general Suffrage wou'd be allow'd to have something due to their Memory, he wou'd set an Asterism on their honourable Names, recommend their bright Example to Imitation, and speak of their excellent Gifts, Graces, and Services, to the Honour of that God, who bless'd them, and made them Blessings to their Generation. Witness in par∣ticular his Funeral Sermon for the late Rev. Mr. <HI>Thomas Bridge,</HI> his worthy Colleague in the Pastoral Relation, and my immediate Predecessor: The <HI>Text</HI> and the <HI>Discourse</HI> most sitly applicable for the <HI>Author</HI>'s own Funeral Sermon. And accordingly I recommend it to your serious Review on this Occasion.</P>
<P>I take Leave now to remind You, with what a nume∣rous Succession of eminent Lights this golden Candlestick has been distinguish'd. You have had your <HI>Wilson, Cotton, Norton, Davenport, Oxenbridge, Allen, Bridge,</HI> and <HI>Wadsworth;</HI> precious Gifts to you from our ascended Sa∣viour, Pastors and Teachers, who have fed You with Knowledge and Understanding: Besides whom, You have enjoy'd the occasional Labours of several worthy Assistants (<HI>Moodey</HI> and <HI>Bailey</HI> in particular) for many Months, or Years together. Your evangelical Advantages surely have
<PB N="iii" REF="004140_0005_1003DAF197125F40"/>
been great: and if your spiritual Improvements be not in some Proportion, your Account will be awful. And for my own part, <HI>when I consider, I am afraid.</HI> It hath often been a solemn Thought with me, <HI>In whose Room</HI> I stood up; what aged, learned, laborious, wise, and venerable <HI>Men of God</HI> have successively gone before me in this holy Ministry: and the Reflection has been very humbling to me, by a Sense of my own comparative Insufficiency, Inex∣perience, Unworthiness, Nothingness. Sure I am, I've the greatest Reason to stand astonish'd at the <HI>Divine Pati∣ence</HI> towards me: and to admire <HI>your Candour</HI> to me, your <HI>kind Acceptance</HI> of my Labours, and the <HI>generous Tokens</HI> of your Love in Reward of them, while I have been with many Imperfections ministring among You, now full <HI>20</HI> Years. And tho' according to the general Run of human Life, I may have still many Days to serve You; yet the surprizing Blow of God's chastning Hand upon me, not many Months since (when all about my Bed conclu∣ded me under a Sentence of Death) and my habitual In∣firmities in Consequence thereof, did awfully warn me, and do daily admonish me, not to expect a long Continuance in this present evil World. O join your Prayers with mine, that a Life so wonderfully reprieved from Destruction, may be employed more than ever for the Glory of God and the Service of your Souls, to which I hope it is sincerely de∣voted; and that when called from You (God only knows how soon or suddenly) I may be found with my Work done, and my Accounts ready, and may finish my Course with Joy. I wish you a <HI>durable,</HI> as well as great Blessing, in my dear <HI>Colleague,</HI> your other Pastor! And this I pray, that your Love may abound yet more and more in Know∣ledge and in all Judgment; that ye may approve Things that are excellent, and continue in the things which ye have learned, and be watchful to strengthen the Things which remain that are ready to die.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="004140_0006_1003DAF4136DC140"/>Let us all concur in heartily lamenting the great and growing <HI>Degeneracies</HI> of the present Day: and let us unite our fervent Prayers, our solicitous Cares, and strenuous Endeavours for the happy Resurrection and Flou∣rishing of Religion and Virtue among us, which is our Life, our truest prosperity, and brightest Crown. Surely <HI>it is Time to seek the Lord, till He come and rain Righ∣teousness upon us.</HI></P>
<P>And have we not Reason to lay to Heart the many sor∣rowful Instances of <HI>Mortality,</HI> we've seen in the Course of a very few Years, among our Pious and Useful, and our Aged and Honorable? <HI>For behold, the Lord, the Lord of Hosts, doth take away from</HI> us <HI>the Stay and the Staff, the Judge, and the Prophet, and the Prudent, and the Ancient, the honourable Man, and the Counsellor, the cunning Artificer, and the eloquent Orator.</HI> Verily by repeated Losses of Men of Note in the Congregation, a holy sovereign God has been not only lessening our Number, but thinning our Glory, impoverishing our Treasury, and weakning our Strength. Their hoary Heads were a visi∣ble Ornament in our Assembly; their shining Characters reflected a superior Lustre upon it; and their several In∣terests, Powers, and active Virtues abundantly strengthen'd our Hands, and encourag'd our Hearts. But now a me∣lancholy Emptiness is seen, where they us'd to appear and act. Alas, how sadly do we miss them! What lamentable Vacancies do we behold in one Seat and another; and few of the like excellent Spirit and Talents succeeding to fill up their Places! Have me not Reason to cry out, with the Prophet! <HI>O Lord God, cease, I beseech Thee; by whom shall</HI> Jacob <HI>arise? for he is small. — Come and let us return to the Lord: for He hath torn, and He will heal us; He hath smitten, and He will bind us up.</HI></P>
<P>We are bleeding particularly by a fresh and deep Wound <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Decease of that good and merciful Man, one of our
<PB N="v" REF="004140_0007_1003DAF754AA9A88"/>
worthy and faithful Deacons, the late Mr. <HI>Jonathan Williams;</HI> over whose Grave I cannot refrain dropping a Tear of Condolence with You, and paying a small Tribute to his Memory. May the God of all Grace sanctify the Death of his Servant to the bereaved Children and Rela∣tives, to his mournful Brethren in Office, and to us all! We have lost in him the amiable Example of a devout, just, peaceable, charitable, and humble Christian, and the valu∣able Help of a very active, prudent, and useful Servant of the Church. The main Qualifications of a <HI>Deacon,</HI> as they are laid down by the inspir'd Apostle in his Epistle to <HI>Timothy,</HI> were visible in this our Brother; <HI>Gravity, In∣tegrity, Temperance, Generosity, sound Faith, and a pure Conscience.</HI> We must bear him this Testimony, that he hath <HI>used his Office well;</HI> and having served his Ge∣neration according to the Will of God, he is <HI>(with</HI> Stephen) fallen asleep. But <HI>if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus, will God bring with him:</HI> and for our further Consolation, in the mean time, <HI>we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the Angels, for the suffering of Death, crown'd with Glory and Honour; Head over all things to his Church, and the Saviour of the Body.</HI> Having ascended up on high, he has received Gifts for Men: and of his Fulness may we still look to receive, even Grace for Grace, Blessing upon Blessing. Ye that make Mention of the LORD, keep not Silence: and give Him no Rest, till He establish, and till He make our <HI>Jerusalem</HI> a Praise in the Earth, as in former Years, and as in the Days of old; even until the Righteousness thereof go forth as Brightness; and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth. Let it be your Prayer day and night, that a gracious God wou'd pardon our Sins, and heal our Back∣slidings, whereby we have expos'd our selves to his fear∣ful Judgments; That he wou'd return and visit his Peo∣ple, made weak by the Fall of so many of his righteous Ones; and that He wou'd close the Breaches in our Walls,
<PB N="vi" REF="004140_0008_1003DAFE78A13910"/>
by raising up a Succession of Persons of a like excellent Spirit and exemplary useful Life, as those that have left us, and who may be like Blessings to us, bright Pledges of his spiritual Presence in the midst of us. He has pro∣mised his gracious Presence to his Church to the End of the World. Let us be Followers of them who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promises. So we may hope, He will be with us, as He was with our Fathers, and will never leave nor forsake us. Rejoyce in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoyce in Him, the inexhaustible Foun∣tain of Life, who (whatever Streams are dried up) re∣mains the same for ever. Be careful for nothing; but in every <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by Prayer and Supplication, with Thanks∣giving, let your Requests be made known to God: And the Peace of God, which passeth all Understanding, shall keep your Hearts through Christ Jesus: To whom be Glory in the Churches, World without End. Amen.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS there's no History in the World of like An∣tiquity with the <HI>Bible,</HI> so none of such extensive and happy Influence; none of equal Use and Service to Mankind. For in the sacred Story we have such Accounts of the <HI>Works of God,</HI> Creation, Providence, and Redemption, as present his amiable (but still tremendous) Perfections to our View in the best and strongest Light, far transcending the highest Discoveries of mere natural Reason; and consequently have a powerful Tendency both to awaken in every considering Soul very awful Apprehensions of his Ma∣jesty and Greatness, and to encourage our Hope and Confidence in his Wisdom, Goodness, and Truth: And here too we have such Narratives of innumerable <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Servants of God</HI> in former Ages of the World, their Character and Conduct, Experiences and Obser∣vations, Lives and Deaths, as are eminently useful for the Direction of our Faith and Practice, afford very convincing Arguments for the Reality, Excellency and
<PB N="2" REF="004140_0010_1003DB01ED953080"/>
Advantage of Divine Revelation, and tend to acquaint us more fully with the glorious Principles of our holy Religion, to establish our Belief of its important Doc∣trines, and engage our Attention and Obedience to its incomparably wise and righteous Precepts. As an ad∣mirable Harmony runs thro' all the Revelations of God to the Sons of Men, so a beautiful Congruity every where appears in the Faith, Worship, and Morals of all Saints (tho' variously excelling in Proportion to the Divine Light and Grace dispens'd to them) thro' all successive Ages of the World. The inspired Records of the <HI>Apostolick</HI> Age may have furnish'd us with the plainest and fairest, the most familiar and most inde∣fective Copies for our Imitation: Yet <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>the Prophets</HI> are not to be thrown by as useless, nor the Examples of <HI>Old Testament-Saints</HI> to be neglected, as of no Importance to us under the Christian Dispensation; but even these are applicable for the Regulation of our Belief, our Temper and Deportment, in the most essen∣tial Instances, with relation to the Things of God and Eternity, and for our Encouragement and Assistance upon many Occasions in the Course of the Christian Life.</P>
<P>On the present Occasion, when we are call'd to mourn the Death of an eminently pious and useful Ser∣vant of God, I have singled out the Example of re∣nowned <HI>Elisha</HI> (who had <HI>his Master taken from his head</HI>) to teach us the most proper Conduct under such a Dis∣pensation.</P>
<P>My Text stands in Connection with the remarkable Story of <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Translation to the Church triumphant above, and <HI>Elisha</HI>'s Succession into his Place in the Church militant below. We hear <HI>Elisha</HI> pathetically mourning the Departure of the old illustrious Prophet: As he saw him ascend in a Chariot of Fire, carry'd up by a Whirlwind into Heaven, he rent his Clothes, and with the Passion of a bereaved Son cried after him, <HI>My
<PB N="3" REF="004140_0011_1003DB06532D4D40"/>
Father, my Father, the Chariot of Israel and the Horse∣men thereof!</HI> — However, he did not long stand gazing up into Heaven: but presently taking up the Mantle of <HI>Elijah,</HI> that had fallen from him at his sudden Rap∣ture, and welcoming this desirable Memorial of his en∣deared Father, the visible Badge of his Office, and a happy Pledge of his inheriting the Blessing that had been promis'd him, he goes forth in the Spirit of <HI>Elias</HI> to enter into his Labours, and goes on his way crying after the GOD of his Master, and walking in the Steps of his Faith. That is now his solicitous Inquiry, <HI>Where is the Lord God of</HI> Elijah? Not satisfied with having <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Mantle, he must have <HI>Elijah</HI>'s GOD too, in the sensible Effects of his powerful and gracious <HI>Presence</HI> with him (the same as had been with his holy Predecessor) which wou'd abundantly make Amends for the Loss he was mourning under, be the most effec∣tual Relief to his sorrowful Heart, the best Help to him in the important Work now devolv'd upon him, and an encouraging Presage of his future Usefulness.— He do's not employ himself in a fruitless Search for <HI>Elijah</HI>; like the Sons of the Prophets, who cou'd not believe his bodily Translation to Heaven, but ima∣gining that his <HI>dead</HI> Corpse might be dropt upon some remote Mountain, or rather perhaps that he was tran∣sported <HI>alive</HI> to some distant obscure Place, and (if so) ought still to retain his Dignity and Station, as Head of the Prophets, would not be restrained from going in Quest after him. Nor do's he lay out any Thought or Pains in curious Speculations upon the invisible World and hidden Life, the Prophet was exalted to: nor in passionate Aggravations of his own and the pub∣lick Loss, by the Departure of so eminent a Man of God. Neither do we hear any rash Wishes for his Return; much less any idolatrous Application to him for his Favour and Help: No, tho' <HI>Elijah</HI> be in a State of Exaltation, a glorious and happy Saint, made like
<PB N="4" REF="004140_0012_1003DB0958E02230"/>
unto the Angels, yet <HI>Elisha</HI> knows better than to pay him Divine Honours, or place him in God's stead. But well aware that his Help is in the Name of the Lord, and hoping to find him a very present Help, he looks off from the Creature, unto the Creator, who is blessed for ever, and who will cause the Blessing to rest upon them, that wait for him. He asks not for <HI>Elijah,</HI> but inquires after his GOD. <HI>Where is the LORD God of</HI> Elijah? Or, as it may be read, <HI>Where is Jehovah, the God of</HI> Elijah, <HI>even He</HI>! The Hebrew Words (APH HU) which our Version joyns to the follow∣ing Clause, as spoken of <HI>Elisha,</HI> stand in the Original connected with the Words foregoing, and are under∣stood by learned Criticks as adding an Emphasis to <HI>Elisha</HI>'s Question, <HI>Where is the LORD, the God of</HI> Elijah, <HI>even He, Himself?</HI> 'Tis not the Language of Infidelity or Diffidence, the Expostulation of an unbe∣lieving or doubting Soul, that question'd the Being of <HI>Elijah</HI>'s God, disputed his Omnipresence, or suspected his Power or Faithfulness to accomplish the great and precious Promise <HI>Elisha</HI> had lately received: But rather 'tis the humble and earnest Expectation and Prayer of Faith, That <HI>Elijah</HI>'s God would be with his surviv∣ing Son and Successor, and now give an early Proof of <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Spirit being come upon him (according to his own former Wish, and the departed Prophet's Farewel-Benediction) in a double Portion of Gifts, Graces, and Blessings.</P>
<P>Our Text may receive some Illustration by com∣paring it with <HI>Isa.</HI> 63.11,—17. (understanding <HI>Israel</HI> to be speaking there) <HI>Then he remembred the Days of old,</HI> Moses <HI>and his People</HI> (recollected and reason'd upon the Story) <HI>saying, WHERE IS HE that brought them up out of the Sea, with the Shepherd of his Flock? WHERE IS HE that put his holy Spirit within him? That led them by the right hand of</HI> Moses, <HI>with his glori∣ous Arm, dividing the Water before them, to make Him∣self
<PB N="5" REF="004140_0013_1003DB1017BA4F70"/>
an everlasting Name?— Look down from Heaven: — WHERE is thy Zeal and thy Strength, the sound∣ing of thy Bowels and of thy tender Mercies towards me? Are they restrained? Doubtless Thou art our Father, tho'</HI> Abraham <HI>be ignorant of us,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Thou Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer, thy Name is from Everlasting. O Lord, return for thy Servants sake, the Tribes of thine Inheritance.</HI> 'Tis the Church's Complaint of God's visible Withdraw from his People, and a passionate Supplication for the Return of his favourable Presence; back'd with a Plea from their Forefathers Experience of the Divine Power and Mercy in commanding glo∣rious Deliverances for them: the Remembrance of which they now improve to encourage their Faith and embolden their Hope in the present Day of Darkness and Distress. So <HI>Gideon,</HI> when the Angel of the Lord appeared to him, saying, <HI>The LORD is with thee, thou mighty Man of Valour</HI>; made that Reply, <HI>Oh my Lord,</HI> if the <HI>LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and WHERE be all his Miracles, which our Fathers told us of?</HI> (Judg. 6.13.) As if he had said, Where is the Lord God of our Fathers? Where are the To∣kens of his powerful and gracious Presence? We see awful Signs of his Departure from us: but where are the happy Pledges of his Return to us! So the Prophet, <HI>Isa.</HI> 51.9, 10. <HI>Awake, awake, put on Strength, O Arm of the LORD: awake as in the ancient Days, in the Generations of old. Art thou not it that cut Rahab, and wounded the Dragon? Art thou not it which hath dried the Sea; that hath made the Depths of the Sea a Way for the Ransomed to pass over?</HI> — Thus in like manner <HI>Elisha,</HI> under a deep Concern upon the awful Frown of Heaven in taking away <HI>Elijah</HI> (who had been a Prophet mighty in Word and Deed before all the People, a Father to him and to all the other Mi∣nisters of Religion and Sons of Learning, and an emi∣nent Means of <HI>Israel</HI>'s Defence and Safety) and now
<PB N="6" REF="004140_0014_1003DB156658C9A8"/>
upon his Return to the Business of his Station, having the River <HI>Jordan</HI> in his Way, which he knew not how to get over, takes the Mantle of <HI>Elijah,</HI> and smites the Waters, crying out, <HI>Where is the Lord, the God of</HI> Elijah, <HI>even HE?</HI> — One notes upon it, "There are the <HI>Remains</HI> of great and good Men, which (like this Mantle) ought to be gather'd up and preserv'd by Survivors; their Sayings, their Writings, their Exam∣ples: that as <HI>their Works follow them</HI> in the Reward of 'em, they may stay behind with us in the Benefit of 'em. But what will it profit, what will it avail us, to have the <HI>Mantles</HI> of those that are gone, their Places, their Books, their Patterns, if we have not their <HI>Spirit,</HI> and their <HI>God?"</HI> — We should set our selves with a careful Hand to gather up whatever (in any kind) has fallen from our pious Predecessors, that may be of Use to us: but above all we shou'd make <HI>the Lord their God</HI> our Choice, and his gracious <HI>Presence</HI> our Heart's Desire, our speedy and constant Pursuit. Thus <HI>Elisha</HI> contented not himself with crying after <HI>Elijah,</HI> My Father, my Father! and taking up his Mantle: But proceeds to call upon his God, and cry after Him, <HI>Where is the LORD, the God of</HI> Elijah, <HI>even HE?</HI></P>
<P>Here we may observe distinctly;</P>
<P N="1">I. He inquires for JEHOVAH. — <HI>Where is the LORD?</HI></P>
<P>Being instructed by his Master <HI>concerning the Name of the LORD,</HI> and having often heard him call upon JEHOVAH, that <HI>great Name</HI> of his God; <HI>Elisha</HI> fol∣lows his Faith, adores the blessed God by the same exalted Name, asks the special Tokens of his Presence, and covets a more improv'd Acquaintance and Com∣munion with Him. He professes his Belief in the One living and true God: implicitly renouncing <HI>Baal</HI> and every Idol; for he knew, that an Idol is Nothing in the World, and that there is none other God but One,

<P>NOTE, <HI>The Majesty of Heaven is to be adored by his Name</HI> JEHOVAH, <HI>and by this Name we are to in∣quire after the true God: encouraging our Faith and Hope, while we seek Him, from the Consideration of his immense Beings absolute Perfection, and infinite Suffici∣ency.</HI></P>
<P>He challenges this Name as His appropriate Glory, and expects to be known and acknowledg'd by it. God spake to <HI>Moses,</HI> and said unto him, <HI>"I am the LORD:</HI> and I appeared unto <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> by the Name of <HI>God Almighty</HI>; and by <HI>my Name JEHOVAH was I</HI> (comparatively) <HI>not known to them.</HI> Wherefore say unto the Children of Israel, <HI>I am the LORD: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God. THIS is my Name for ever, and this is my Memorial unto all Generations.</HI> See now that <HI>I, even I, am He; and there is no God with Me.</HI>— So he speaks by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah; "I am the LORD</HI>; that is <HI>my Name:</HI> and <HI>my Glory</HI> will I not give to another. Ye are my Witnesses, saith the LORD, and my Servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe <HI>Me,</HI> and understand that I AM HE: <HI>be∣fore</HI>

I, even I, am the LORD.</HI> I am <HI>the First,</HI> and I am <HI>the Last,</HI> and <HI>besides Me</HI> there is no God; <HI>I know not any.</HI>— So He hath said by the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah:</HI> "The LORD is the <HI>true God,</HI> He is the <HI>living God,</HI> and an <HI>everlasting King.</HI> The Gods that have not made the Heavens and the Earth, even they shall perish. The Portion of <HI>Jacob</HI> is <HI>not like them:</HI> the LORD of hosts is <HI>his Name.</HI> "Thus saith the LORD, let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he <HI>understandeth</HI> and <HI>knoweth ME,</HI> that <HI>I am the LORD,</HI> which exercise Lovingkindness, Judgment and Righ∣teousness in the Earth: for in these Things I delight, saith the LORD.</P>
<P>JEHOVAH is the tremendous Name, which stands at the Head of the <HI>Ten Commandments.</HI> "God spake all these Words, saying, <HI>I am the LORD.</HI> — This proclaims Him the only proper Object of Divine Homage and religious Service, enforces our Obedience to Him, awakens a holy Fear in us, invites our Faith and Love, and animates our Hope of a gracious Accep∣tance and Reward. It is written, "Thou shalt <HI>fear</HI> the LORD▪ Him only shalt thou <HI>serve,</HI> and to Him shalt thou <HI>cleave,</HI> and <HI>swear</HI> by his Name,—"Hear, O Israel, The LORD our God is one LORD: and thou shalt <HI>love</HI> the LORD thy God with all thine Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Might. — <HI>"Know</HI> that the LORD thy God, He is <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>faithful</HI> God, which keepeth Covenant and Mercy with them that love Him and keep his Command∣ments. — "Thou shalt remember the LORD thy God.— Thou shalt not go after <HI>other gods:</HI> for the LORD thy God is a jealous God. — <HI>Sanctify</HI> the LORD God in your Heart.— "If you do <HI>return unto the LORD</HI> with all your Heart, then <HI>put away strange gods,</HI> and <HI>prepare your Heart</HI> unto the LORD, and serve Him <HI>only.</HI>— <HI>"Seek</HI> the LORD, while He

are baptiz'd into this Name, and in this Name of our God we are to walk: living a Life of Dependence upon Him, Devotedness to Him, and Communion with Him. We must be inquiring after and seeking the LORD in all his Ways, Ordinances and Providen∣ces. That must continually be the Question with us, <HI>WHERE is the LORD?</HI> His gracious Presence must be our principal Aim and Desire, as that in which lies all our Safety, Prosperity, Glory and Happiness. <HI>"Blessed</HI> is the Man, O LORD, whom Thou chusest and causest to <HI>approach unto Thee.</HI> "The LORD is my Shepherd; <HI>I shall not want:</HI> Yea, tho' I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, <HI>I will fear no Evil</HI>; for <HI>Thou art with me.</HI> "The LORD is a <HI>Sun</HI> and <HI>Shield,</HI> He will give <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> and <HI>no good Thing will He withold</HI> from them that walk up∣rightly.— <HI>To whom should we go but to HIM?</HI> Nor <HI>need</HI> we enquire after any other god: for He is able to do for us exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think. If JEHOVAH be his Name, what may we not expect from his favourable Presence! Thus He saith, "Fear not, <HI>I am with thee.</HI> "Behold, I am the LORD: <HI>Is there any Thing too hard for Me?</HI> Verily, the Lovingkindness of the LORD is better than Life: and his Wrath worse than Death. Who knoweth the Extent of his Goodness, or the Power of his Anger!— Let all the Inhabitants of the Earth venerate this great and terrible Name JEHOVAH, and tremble at his Presence; for our God is a consuming Fire, and who can stand before Him whence once He is angry! Cleanse your Hands and Hearts, ye Sinners: Humble your selves in the Sight of the LORD: Stand in Awe, and sin not: Draw nigh to Him, and He will draw nigh to You: Lift up your Souls to Him, and not to lying Vanities; Seek the LORD, and his Strength: Seek his Face evermore. And let the Heart of them that seek the LORD, be joyful. Ye <HI>Saints,</HI> glory in

his holy Name: Extol Him that rideth upon the Hea∣vens by his Name JAH, and rejoyce before Him. But serve the LORD with Fear, and rejoyce with Trem∣bling: for with Him is dreadful Majesty, and He is terrible out of his holy Places.</P>
<P>A <HI>Pharaoh</HI> may insult and say, Who is the LORD, that I shou'd obey Him? But let <HI>Israel</HI> humbly submit and say, Whatsoever the LORD commandeth, that will we do, and will be obedient. If <HI>Laban</HI> consults his <HI>Teraphim,</HI> and bows down to graven Images; yet let <HI>Jacob</HI> seek JEHOVAH, and put away all strange gods, pay his Vows to the LORD, and serve him only. Let the Prophets, which eat at <HI>Jezebel</HI>'s Table, follow <HI>Baal,</HI> and call on the Name of their Idol: But let <HI>Elijah</HI> fol∣low the LORD, follow Him fully, and call on the Name of JEHOVAH. Let the Children of this World trust in the Abundance of their Wealth, and make Gold their Confidence: But let the Children of Light trust in the living God, make the LORD their Hope, and stay themselves upon JEHOVAH, with whom is everlasting Strength, and in whose Favour is Life. Acquaint now thy self with Him, and be at Peace: thereby Good shall come unto thee. Under afflictive Losses, make it your Inquiry, <HI>Where is the LORD?</HI> Let none be heard saying, "They have taken away my gods, and what have I more! "Many there be that say, Who will shew us any Good? Their Inquiries are, "What shall we eat? and what shall we drink? and wherewith shall we be cloathed? Where is there a good Bargain to be got? Where is Mirth to be had? Which way shall we come to Honour? Thus they are full of the Cares and Cries of Nature and Passion. <HI>But none of them saith, WHERE is God my Maker</HI>? That's the Cry of Grace, "My Soul thirsteth for God, the living God: <HI>when shall I come and ap∣pear before God"?</HI>— "O that I knew <HI>where I might find Him!</HI>— "Whom have I in <HI>Heaven but Thee?</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="004140_0021_1003DB281CA8C6D8"/>
and there is <HI>none</HI> upon <HI>Earth</HI> that <HI>I desire besides Thee.</HI> Lo, they that are <HI>far from Thee shall perish:</HI> But it is <HI>good for me</HI> to <HI>draw near to God.</HI> — Such should be the ardent Breathings of Faith, Love, and Desire in our Souls toward JEHOVAH. We should be daily seeking and asking for Him; having our Eyes ever to the LORD, deprecating his Departure from us, and desir∣ing his Presence with us. We shou'd make it our Concern that our Fellowship may be with the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, whose Name is JEHOVAH. We shou'd delight in approaching to Him: and Him we shou'd acknowledge in all our Ways. In the Day of Prosperity we shou'd bless the Lord as the Author of all our Mercies: and in the Day of Adversity we shou'd consider his Hand, and inquire wherefore He contendeth with us. Under all the Troubles of Life and Apprehensions of Death, we shou'd be <HI>inquiring early after the LORD our God.</HI> When Religion is dying, we shou'd cry, <HI>Where is the LORD</HI>? and pray, <HI>Help LORD,</HI> when <HI>the godly Man ceaseth.</HI> Under our most sorrowful Bereavements we shou'd remember, <HI>The LORD liveth</HI>; and whoever dies and leaves us, still JEHOVAH is nigh to them that seek Him, and is the same Yesterday, to Day, and for ever. Tho' even an <HI>Elijah</HI> forsakes us; yet in this we may be confident, if the LORD his God and our God be with us, we shall have our Loss abundantly compensated. On such an Occasion then let Survivors be inquiring after the LORD God of <HI>Elijah.</HI>— Which brings me to observe, in the next place,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Elisha</HI> inquires for <HI>Jehovah,</HI> as the GOD of <HI>Eli∣jah.— WHERE is the Lord GOD of</HI> Elijah, <HI>even He?</HI></P>
<P>It mayn't be amiss to premise here, that the Majesty of Heaven is in our Text and many other Scriptures stiled JEHOVAH ELOHIM: upon which judicious Criticks have observ'd, that the <HI>singular</HI> Name <HI>Jehovah</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="004140_0022_1003DB30C6596978"/>
represents the Deity to us as <HI>One,</HI> while that of <HI>Elohim,</HI> being <HI>plural,</HI> represents Him as <HI>More</HI>; and <HI>Jehovah</HI> being join'd with <HI>Elohim,</HI> this perhaps is design'd to engage our Attention to what <HI>both</HI> suggest at one and the same time, The <HI>Unity of Essence</HI> and the <HI>Plurality of Persons</HI> in the Godhead. We are not to take <HI>Je∣hovah Elohim</HI> in our Text as intending the <HI>Father</HI> only; however it may mean Him primarily, yet is not to be understood <HI>exclusively</HI> of the <HI>Son</HI> and the <HI>holy Ghost.</HI> Nor is <HI>Jehovah Elohim</HI> to be understood <HI>Jehovah</HI> ONE of the <HI>Elohim,</HI> but we fitly read it <HI>the LORD GOD,</HI> the sacred <HI>THREE which are ONE. Elisha</HI> cries out, <HI>Where is the LORD GOD of</HI> Elijah?</P>
<P>Let it be more particularly remark'd:</P>
<P N="1">1. He asserts, that <HI>Jehovah</HI> is GOD, <HI>the</HI> GOD. <HI>Elisha</HI> might now have in his Thoughts what had happen'd in a late notable Controversy between <HI>Elijah</HI> and his Adversaries, upon that grand Question, <HI>WHO is God? Elijah</HI> reprov'd all the People, saying, "How long halt ye between two Opinions? If JEHOVAH be <HI>God,</HI> follow Him: but if <HI>Baal,</HI> then follow him.— And finally he put the Dispute upon this Issue, "Call ye on the name of <HI>your gods,</HI> and I will call on the Name of JEHOVAH; And He shall be the God that answereth by Fire; <HI>He</HI> [Hu, the same, Himself] <HI>the</HI> GOD!— And when all the People saw the Fire of the LORD fall upon <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Sacrifice, they humbled themselves before the Prophet, and own'd their full Conviction, crying out, in that vehement and repeated Exclamation, JEHOVAH <HI>Himself the</HI> ELOHIM! <HI>The</HI> LORD, <HI>He</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">In the Original the Word is HU; which, some think, is one of the <HI>Names</HI> of God: But most Expositors judge it only a common Pronoun, and read it. <HI>He, Himself,</HI> or the same.—<HI>Dominus ipse Deus.</HI> 1 Kin. 18.39.</NOTE> is <HI>the</HI> God! It seems an <HI>Adoration</HI> some∣thing
<PB N="15" REF="004140_0023_1003DB324A95E278"/>
like that of the Apostle <HI>Thomas,</HI> when in a Transport of Love and Joy, he broke out in that Ad∣dress to the risen Jesus, <HI>My LORD and my GOD!</HI></P>
<P>As to the Import of <HI>Elohim</HI> or GOD, I take it not to be a mere <HI>relative</HI> Word, or a Term of <HI>Office</HI> only, signifying a kind Providence and Dominion, as some wou'd carry it, and properly applicable to created Rulers and Benefactors: But I look upon it to be ra∣ther of an <HI>absolute</HI> Signification (like the Word <HI>Jeho∣vah</HI>) and according to the Use of it in Scripture pro∣perly and strictly it denotes the supreme Being, under the Character of the <HI>Almighty,</HI> including the Idea of infinite Perfection, necessary Existence, and Indepen∣dency. The original and genuine Meaning of the Word, I conclude, may be best learnt from the Use of it in such Texts as those, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 28.2. <HI>Say to the Prince of</HI> Tyrus, <HI>Thou art a</HI> MAN, <HI>and not</HI> GOD. So <HI>Num.</HI> 23.19. GOD <HI>is not a</HI> MAN, <HI>that He should lie; neither the Son of Man, that He should repent.</HI> And <HI>Hos.</HI> 11.9. <HI>I will not execute the Fierceness of mine Anger; for I am</HI> GOD, <HI>and not</HI> MAN. There's an observable and beautiful <HI>Antithesis</HI> in these several Pla∣ces, which must be lost, and the Texts unintelligible, if the word GOD be properly a mere Term of <HI>Office</HI> or <HI>Relation,</HI> and not of <HI>Essence</HI> or <HI>Nature,</HI> as well as the word MAN. Evident it is, tint the <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Human</HI> NATURES are here put in Contradistinction, one to the other: and while the words [<HI>Man</HI> and <HI>Son of Man</HI>] signify a Being created, a Nature frail, imper∣fect, and very mutable, the other and opposite word [<HI>God</HI>] is used to denote a Being uncaused and eternal, a Nature absolutely and immutably perfect, infinitely good and glorious and blessed in it self, and for ever independent; which, upon a little Reflection, will be found Ideas essentially connected with, and inseparable from the Character of <HI>Almighty.</HI> ELOHIM then, in the true, original, and complex Notion of the Word, is
<PB N="16" REF="004140_0024_1003DB33CF65FC70"/>
a Name appropriate to JEHOVAH. Indeed there is a consequential, subordinate and secondary Notion, in which the Term may be us'd sometimes, <HI>viz.</HI> that of a <HI>Ruler</HI> and <HI>Benefactor</HI>; for these Characters are necessa∣rily included in the Idea of <HI>God Almighty:</HI> And by way of Analogy even Creatures, Angels and Men, are in that View of the Word sometimes called <HI>Elohim.</HI></P>
<P>But however, it primarily imports the OMNIPOTENT, the Supreme and First Cause: and is a Name not com∣municable to any Creature, but in a <HI>lax, inferential,</HI> and <HI>metaphorical</HI> Use of the Word. JEHOVAH, even He alone is GOD, in the proper Application and strict Sense of the Term. None other are Gods <HI>by Nature</HI>; but are <HI>falsely so called,</HI> or figuratively, allusively, and in the consequential Notion of the Word: for none are really and properly Gods, if not so <HI>by Nature.</HI> Unto us there is but <HI>One God</HI>; but one Being that is essenti∣ally and truly God: Yet this ONE is (ineffably) some∣how THREE, variously denominated, <HI>the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost.</HI> (1 Joh. 5.7.) Natural Rea∣son is capable of strongly arguing the UNITY of the Godhead: but supernatural Revelation makes the fur∣ther Discovery of a TRINITY <HI>in Unity.</HI> The holy Scripture makes those <HI>Personal</HI> Attributions to the sacred THREE, which manifestly infer their different Modes of Subsistence: and yet it ascribes all Divine Perfections and Honours equally to them all, which as manifestly infers their being <HI>One</HI> in Essence. Not only the <HI>Father,</HI> but the <HI>Son</HI> and the <HI>Spirit</HI> likewise, are called GOD in the genuine, absolute, sublime Sense of the Word, without any special Limitation, without any Signatures of a figurative Use, or a diminutive and im∣perfect Sense design'd. All the essential Characters of GOD are attributed to the <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>holy Ghost,</HI> in the same Heights of Language as to the <HI>Father,</HI> without any apparent Marks of Distinction; even those peculiar Glories, which the supreme Being has ever challeng'd
<PB N="17" REF="004140_0025_1003DADE19CA14D0"/>
as his sole Prerogatives, whereby He will be known and distinguish'd from <HI>all that is called God</HI> besides, whether in Heaven or Earth. <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.8. <HI>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Al∣mighty.</HI> When therefore the Law of the LORD saith, <HI>Thou shall have no other gods before me,</HI> it is to be in∣terpreted as exclusive of Idols, and every mere Crea∣ture, but still as inclusive of the <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>holy Spirit,</HI> who together with the <HI>Father</HI> are the one Object of Faith, Devotion and Obedience. "Know ye, that the LORD, He is GOD. "This is the <HI>true God and eternal Life.</HI> "There is none <HI>good</HI> but <HI>One,</HI> that is GOD: and if thou will enter into Life, keep his Com∣mandments. "Behold, the Lord GOD saith, I come quickly, and my Reward is with Me. "I am <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last. "I <HI>Jesus</HI> have sent mine Angel to testify unto You these Things in the Churches.—And since we hear these Things, let it not be said of us, as it is of some, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.21. <HI>That when they knew GOD, they glorified Him not as GOD, neither were thankful.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to observe,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Elisha</HI> asserts <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Interest in JEHOVAH, and special Relation to Him, as the Lord <HI>his</HI> GOD.— <HI>Where is the Lord God of</HI> Elijah?</P>
<P>For Explication of this it must be noted: Since the very Names <HI>JEHOVAH Elohim</HI> carry in them an Idea of absolute Perfection, of eternal Power, and of infi∣nite Goodness and Happiness, hence when the supreme Being is said to be <HI>Jehovah Elohim</HI> to a Person or Peo∣ple, it means his being That <HI>unto them,</HI> which He is <HI>in Himself,</HI> his shewing them his Glory, causing his Goodness to pass before them, and giving them to see and enjoy Him <HI>as GOD.</HI>—They that make the Term <HI>God</HI> a mere Term of <HI>Office</HI> and <HI>Relation,</HI> have contriv'd to fix their narrow and low Idea on the
<PB N="18" REF="004140_0026_1003DB39CAE51BB8"/>
Word with a View to the weakning and eluding an eminent Scripture-Argument for the true and proper Divinity of our <HI>Saviour</HI> and the <HI>holy Spirit,</HI> from one Place and another where they are expresly called <HI>God.</HI> But now if we attend to the constant universal Use of the Word in Scripture, as apply'd to the <HI>First Cause,</HI> we shall find it an <HI>essential</HI> Name, and carrying no∣thing more of Relation or Office in it, than there is in the Name <HI>Jehovah.</HI> Words indeed of an abso∣lute Signification may put on a relative Form, by be∣ing connected with Pronouns possessive, as <HI>My, Thy,</HI> &amp;c. But still the primary Signification is retain'd, and is well consistent with this Use of the Words. Thus, when God saith, "I will be <HI>thy God",</HI> it means <HI>(Ero tibi in Deum)</HI> I will express the GOD <HI>to thee:</HI> which is but in other Words to say, I will be to thee <HI>the Almighty, the All-sufficient</HI> (I will shew my self JEHOVAH ELOHIM to thee) will act the Part of the <HI>Lord God Omnipotent</HI> towards thee, in performing my Promises to thee, and securing to thee a perfect Hap∣piness in the way of the Gospel-Covenant. Accord∣ingly, when the Lord is call'd <HI>the God</HI> of any, it in∣timates his being their <HI>Covenant-God,</HI> in and through Jesus Christ the Mediator, and his setting his Heart as the Heart of GOD upon them, his exhibiting the <HI>Divine Nature</HI> to them in agreable and blessed Effects, his dis∣playing the Character of GOD (an infinitely and immu∣table perfect and mighty Being) in his tender Care of them, and wise and powerful Operations for their Be∣nefit and his own Glory from them, according to the Tenour of that gracious Covenant, into which He has taken them: and on their part, it implies their being under Covenant-Obligations to Him, owning Him in the Character of GOD, revering his Perfections, pay∣ing due Acknowledgements to Him, and seeking their Happiness in Him, <HI>as</HI> GOD, who is above all, blessed for evermore.— Thus, the LORD GOD of <HI>Elijah</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="004140_0027_1003DB41B2D4BDB8"/>
(in our Text) means the supreme Being consider'd as <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Covenant-God, his chosen Portion, his avouch∣ed Sovereign, and the Object of his Worship, Faith and Hope, in Opposition to <HI>Baal,</HI> and the Creature, which others serv'd: or as having acted the GOD to∣wards <HI>Elijah,</HI> taken him into Communion with Him∣self, own'd and honour'd him as his Servant, reveal'd Himself to him, spoken by him, call'd and furnish'd him to the Office of a Prophet, protected and succeeded him in it, and finally crown'd him with a glorious Reward. In these Regards the blessed God is call'd the GOD of <HI>Elijah.</HI> Not that He is so call'd in Exclusion of all others, as if this were <HI>Elijah</HI>'s peculiar Privilege: for the Scripture puts the same Honour on many besides. Thus we hear God call'd the Lord God of <HI>Shem,</HI> the God of <HI>Abraham,</HI> &amp;c. importing the like near Relati∣on and endeared Affection between God and them, as in the present Case. But it is to be understood as spo∣ken in Exclusion of the Worshippers of <HI>Baal,</HI> and of <HI>ungodly Sinners</HI> in general.</P>
<P>Indeed in a very large Sense <HI>Jehovah</HI> may be call'd <HI>the God of all Flesh,</HI> the God of the <HI>whole Earth,</HI> as He is God <HI>unto</HI> all in some Regards; displaying the Powers and Perfections of the <HI>Deity</HI> in their Creation and Pre∣servation, and doing those Things for every one, in common, which none but GOD most high can accom∣plish: and as He is the only rightful Object of religi∣ous Worship, unto all, and their alone satisfying Por∣tion and Happiness. But there is a transcendent and very peculiar Sense in which <HI>Jehovah</HI> is call'd the GOD of <HI>Elijah,</HI> with other the faithful Saints and Servants of the Lord.</P>
<P>Here we may distinguish, and say briefly,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Consider <HI>Elijah</HI> merely as an <HI>Israelite,</HI> knowing and owning the true Religion, JEHOVAH might be call'd <HI>his</HI> GOD; tho' but in Common with the rest of the professing <HI>Hebrews.</HI> Tho' there was a very gene∣ral
<PB N="20" REF="004140_0028_1003DB43C07562C8"/>
Apostasy in this Prophet's Day, insomuch that <HI>Elijah</HI> thought himself almost <HI>left alone</HI>; yet there was a Remnant of some Thousands, in secret Corners of the Land, who had not bow'd the Knee to <HI>Baal.</HI> These were together with him under the external Administra∣tion of the Covenant of Grace, separated for a peculiar People, under a special Care of Divine Providence; and stood visibly intitled to the Lord as their God. He is frequently call'd the Lord God of the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> of all <HI>Israel</HI> in Common. And the Case is the same with every <HI>Christian</HI> People under the present Dispensation. <HI>Is He the God of the</HI> Jews <HI>only? Is He not also the God of the</HI> Gentiles? which in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained Mercy through their Unbelief. They that in former Ages were not a Peo∣ple, are now the People of God and Children of the Promise, to whom pertaineth the Adoption, and the Glory, equally as to <HI>Israel</HI> of old. And God is visibly <HI>their</HI> GOD; He is in the midst of every Christian Peo∣ple, by the external Symbols of his gracious Presence, and by his holy Spirit striving with them: while other Nations that have not known the true Religion, and are <HI>without Christ,</HI> are represented as <HI>having no Hope,</HI> and being <HI>without GOD in the World.</HI>— O let us admire the Condescention of the blessed God in taking any of the fallen Children of Men into a Covenant of Grace, and affording them the Signs of his favourable Presence and Means of Salvation. <HI>What is Man, O LORD, that thou art mindful of him! and what the Son of Man, that Thou visitest him!</HI>— And let us adore His Sovereignty, in the visible Distinctions of His Grace, while He discovers Himself in His Gospel to one Person or People, and hides his Face from others.— Let us tremble at the Apprehensions of our awful standing in God's holy Covenant, mourn our Sins as peculiarly aggravated, and resolve upon a future Care of keeping Covenant with God, at the same time em∣bracing

the Promises by Faith. <HI>Isa.</HI> 48.17, 18. <HI>Thus saith the LORD thy Redeemer, the holy One of</HI> Israel, <HI>I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldst go. O that thou hadst hearkned to my Commandments! then had thy Peace been as a River, and thy Righteousness as the Waves of the Sea.</HI> But I proceed to observe,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Consider <HI>Elijah</HI> as an Israelite <HI>indeed,</HI> a truly pious and good Man; so the LORD was <HI>his</HI> GOD in a <HI>more special</HI> and <HI>exalted</HI> Sense.</P>
<P><HI>Elijah</HI> was one who cleaved to the Lord with Pur∣pose of Heart, when all <HI>Israel</HI> seem'd to be revolted from Him; but yet there was a Remnant according to the Election of Grace: and in common with these, <HI>Elijah</HI> had the LORD for <HI>his</HI> GOD. There is an ap∣propriate Sense, in which He is the Lord God of his <HI>Saints,</HI> or true Believers. Real Saints have the Lord for their reconcil'd God, manifesting Himself to them so as He does not to the World, and doing those Things for their Souls, which none other can do: His most terrible Attributes speak Friendship to them, and stand engaged for their Safety and Happiness: He is their actual, as well as chosen Patron here, and Portion here∣after: As they follow Him with their whole Souls, so He loves them and seeks their Good with his whole Heart, and they are kept by the Power of God thro' Faith unto Salvation: They are his Favorites in this World, and Heirs of Life in the next. Hence the Psalmist's devout and joyful Soul broke forth in those exulting Words (Psal. 48.14.) <HI>This GOD is OUR God for ever and ever, He will be our Guide even unto Death.</HI> To the same Purpose that triumphant Language of the Apostle (Rom. 8.38.39.) <HI>I am perswaded, that neither Death nor Life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Pow∣ers, nor Things present nor Things to come, nor Height nor Depth, nor any other Creature, shall be able to sepa∣rate us from the Love of God which is in Christ Jesus our

Lord.</HI> Even Death itself, which dissolves all natural Unions and civil Relations, yet affects not the Saints Interest in God, but brings their separate Souls into nearer Communion with Him. When He takes them out of the World, He gathers their <HI>Spirits</HI> to Himself, and still remains <HI>their GOD,</HI> to the most happy Pur∣poses: and He will so in regard of their outward Man too; for the Resurrection and Happiness of the <HI>Body</HI> is imply'd in the Lord's being <HI>their GOD,</HI> according to our Saviour's Argument, <HI>Luk.</HI> 20.37, 38.— In a Word, To have the Lord for <HI>our GOD</HI> implies (in the strict and full Meaning of the Phrase) all the Joy, Glory and Bliss, that human Nature is capable of. Nothing on this side the Perfection and Blessedness of Heaven will rise up to the just Import of that great and precious Promise, That the Lord will be <HI>our GOD.</HI> All possible Excellencies concentre in Him, which are his own infinite Happiness, and will be an all-sufficient Happiness to the Saints in Light. <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.16. <HI>But now they desire a better Country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a City.</HI> And there he will eminently display the GOD unto them in a beatific Sense. Then shall the Apostle's Prayer for the Saints receive its compleat Answer, Eph. 3.19. <HI>That ye may be filled with all the Fulness of GOD.</HI> The communicable Ful∣ness of GOD shall be theirs intirely. Then in a very exalted and now inconceivable Sense, they will <HI>dwell in GOD, and GOD in them,</HI> thro'out a blessed Eternity.</P>
<P>Allow me here to apply this Head, in a few REFLECTIONS.</P>
<P N="1">1. See now the infinite <HI>Obligations</HI> we are under to <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the blessed Mediator between GOD and Man, who suffered for us (the Just for the Unjust) that he might bring us unto GOD, and in whom GOD is reconciling the World unto Himself. In and through <HI>Christ</HI> only it is that JEHOVAH becomes our GOD and
<PB N="23" REF="004140_0031_1003DB53C6B21C80"/>
<HI>Father,</HI> and takes us near to Himself. Behold, the <HI>Lamb</HI> of God, who was deliver'd for our Offences, and raised again for our Justification, and ever liveth to make Intercession for us! Ye know the Grace of our Lord <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>: Sing forth the Honour of his Name, and make his Praise glorious. Sing to Him with thankful Souls in that adoring Language (<HI>Psal.</HI> 68.18.) <HI>Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led Captivity Cap∣tive: thou hast received Gifts for Men; yea, for the re∣bellious, that the LORD God might dwell among them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Learn too the vast <HI>Advantage</HI> and <HI>Excellence</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and how justly Believers place the highest Value upon <HI>reveal'd Religion,</HI> that opens to us the Co∣venant of Grace, and presents the blessed GOD in such an amiable attractive Light to his People, as <HI>their GOD</HI> in Christ: which is a peculiar and exalted Reflection, the most fruitful of beneficial and glorious Effects in them, happily influential to enlarge, refine, and subli∣mate their Minds, and draw out their Souls toward GOD, in fervent Desires, in supreme Affection and Delight, firm Affiance and humble Submission, vigo∣rous Hopes and rais'd Expectations, the most sincere and solemn Self-Dedications, intire Love of Commu∣nion with GOD, and constant Care of Obedience to Him; and by all tending to minister abundant Peace and Consolation to them, under the various Troubles of Life, and the awful Prospects of Death and Eternity: far above every Dictate of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> far above all <HI>moral</HI> Considerations, that the mere Light of <HI>Nature</HI> in its best Improvements was ever able to suggest. While the most enlighten'd <HI>Heathen</HI> can argue but darkly about an <HI>unknown GOD,</HI> and have no solid and rational Assurance that He is <HI>their GOD, We</HI> now through Comfort of the <HI>Scriptures</HI> have <HI>Hope,</HI> a Hope that shall <HI>never make us ashamed.</HI> Well may the Saints (as all real ones do) account their <HI>Bible</HI> a Treasure, prize the Oracles of God <HI>above Thousands of Gold and
<PB N="24" REF="004140_0032_1003DB5643C7C600"/>
Silver,</HI> make his Statutes their <HI>Songs</HI> in the House of their Pilgrimage, and take his Testimonies as their <HI>Heritage</HI> for ever.</P>
<P N="3">3. To have JEHOVAH for our GOD, what greater <HI>Privilege, Honour,</HI> or <HI>Blessedness</HI> than this! It speaks the transcendent Happiness and Dignity of the <HI>Saints</HI>: and it loudly calls upon 'em to admire and magnify the distinguishing and rich Grace of God toward them, in becoming <HI>their</HI> God, and taking them into Covenant and Communion with Himself, when Thousands of their Fellow-Creatures round about them (originally not greater Sinners, nor by Nature any more the Chil∣dren of Hell, than themselves) are perishing without Hope and without God in the World.</P>
<P N="4">4. How shou'd we admire the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of the Saints, which God giveth them? It is seen in the <HI>Choice,</HI> they have made for themselves, of JEHOVAH for their GOD, who is above all gods, the sole worthy Object of Divine Service, and the only satisfactory Portion of im∣mortal Souls, an almighty Friend, able to bless them and make them a Blessing in this Life, and to com∣plete their Happiness in the next.</P>
<P N="5">5. And if the LORD be <HI>their GOD,</HI> what a conspi∣cuous and signal <HI>Glory</HI> does it reflect on any <HI>Place,</HI> that abounds with <HI>Righteous</HI> Ones! Surely GOD is in the midst of it, and He will appoint Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks round about it. What is the Name by which the City of Truth, the Land of Uprightness, shall be called? The God of Truth and Grace Himself hath pronounced it (Ezek. 48.35.) <HI>The Name of it shall be, JEHOVAH-SHAMMAH, The LORD is there.</HI>— This Inscription, most lovely and beautiful, was it not once seen, engraven in fairest Characters, on BOSTON &amp; NEW ENGLAND! When the People of this TOWN and Land, in the Days of our first Generations, were as <HI>a noble Vine and wholly a right Seed,</HI> then the GOD of <HI>Bethel</HI> was eminently the GOD of <HI>Boston</HI>; the GOD of
<PB N="25" REF="004140_0033_1003B89F45388088"/>
<HI>Israel,</HI> the GOD of <HI>New England</HI>: and how <HI>honorable</HI> a Place was it, a City of Renown, the Glory of all Lands! But alas, now that we have deeply corrupted our selves, and the Place is filled with <HI>degenerate Plants,</HI> how is our <HI>Glory departed</HI> in a very lamentable Mea∣sure, and <HI>turned into Shame</HI>! Are there not evidently but <HI>few</HI> (in Comparison) that can truly call the GOD of our Fathers <HI>their GOD</HI>! Have not Multitudes, Multi∣tudes, forgotten the Rock of Israel, and practically de∣spised and cast off the LORD, even the LORD, the Hope of our Fathers! And what little Reason then have we to expect, that He will be a GOD to us, in like manner as He was to them! If, with <HI>Ephraim</HI> of old, we sin yet more and more, and do not return to our Fathers GOD, may we not fear the Execution of that terrible Threatning (Hos. 13.7, 8.) <HI>Therefore I will be unto them as a Lion; as a Leopard by the way will I observe them; I will meet them as a Bear bereav'd of her Whelps.</HI>— I shall add the encouraging Words, which follow: O Israel, <HI>thou hast destroyed thy self, but in Me is thine Help.</HI>— O Israel, <HI>return unto the LORD thy God: for thou hast fallen by thine Iniquity. Take with you Words, and turn to the LORD; So I will be as the Dew unto</HI> Israel, <HI>he shall grow as the Lily, shall cast forth his Roots and spread his Branches, his Beauty shall be as the Olive-Tree, and his Smell as</HI> Le∣banon.— Let us remember, that GOD is in the Generation of the <HI>Righteous,</HI> and He will exalt them: But Woe to the Generation of his Wrath. O that we were wise, that we understood this! May the blessed God pour out his Spirit from on high, and revive his Work among us; that it may come to pass, which is written, "As yet they shall use this Speech in the Land of <HI>Judah,</HI> and in the Cities thereof, <HI>The LORD bless thee, O Habitation of Justice, and Mountain of Holi∣ness!</HI>— Then will Salvation be nigh to us, and Glory dwell in our Land.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="26" REF="004140_0034_1003DB5A60843418"/>6. What has been said, shou'd teach us to <HI>love</HI> and <HI>honour</HI> the <HI>Saints</HI>; who have the Image of GOD upon them, and a Propriety in Him as <HI>their GOD</HI>: And this Reflection speaks <HI>Encouragement</HI> to such as are careful in all proper Ways to shew their Respect to the <HI>Godly</HI> Man, and put Honour upon the <HI>Faithful</HI> in the Land: But it may well strike <HI>Terror</HI> on such as envy, hate, injure, or slight them. The Righteous are a <HI>People near and dear to GOD,</HI> and He hears the Reproach of <HI>Moah</HI> and the Revilings of the Chil∣dren of <HI>Ammon,</HI> while in their Pride they magnify themselves against the People of the LORD of Hosts, and the LORD will be terrible to them: howbeit, our GOD will turn the Curse into a Blessing, and He will bless them that bless his People. The Time is com∣ing, when He will gloriously plead the Cause of his People, and when He will make his Saints an eternal Excellency, when they shall be as the Stones of a Crown, lifted up as an Ensign upon his Land, and the Sinners in the Earth shall <HI>take hold of the Skirt of him that is a</HI> Jew, <HI>saying, We will go with You, for we have heard that GOD is with You.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Here's a powerful Argument, which shou'd per∣suade us all to be concern'd, that we may get into the <HI>Number</HI> of the <HI>Saints,</HI> and be able to claim a Pro∣priety in GOD, as <HI>our</HI> GOD. We should examine what Evidences we have of a Covenant-Interest in GOD, and vital Relation to Him as <HI>our</HI> GOD in <HI>Christ.</HI> O let us all look to it, that we do not <HI>fail of the Grace of GOD</HI>; that we do not fail of securing this great and most momentous Concern: for if the LORD be not <HI>our</HI> GOD, in the Sense of the Gospel-Covenant, He will be a <HI>Consuming Fire</HI> to us. That's the Doom he has pass'd on a hypocritical Nation, (<HI>Hos.</HI> 1.9.) <HI>Ye are not my People, and I will not he your GOD.</HI> How∣ever false Professors may boast in the LORD, and say, <HI>He is our GOD</HI>; yet they shall find at last, that He
<PB N="27" REF="004140_0035_1003DB6064A8C7E8"/>
will reject their Confidences, and will be a GOD to them in no other than a dreadful <HI>vindictive</HI> Sense, a God that judgeth Sinners: Verily <HI>their GOD</HI> will come with Vengeance, to punish them with everlasting De∣struction, who have not known Him, nor obey'd his Gospel.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> in a Word, let such as have sincerely avouch∣ed the LORD for their GOD, see to it, that they <HI>walk worthy of the LORD unto all Pleasing,</HI> that they adorn their high Profession by a <HI>good Conversation in Christ,</HI> and continually be in Care to live and act up to their spiritual Dignity, Privileges and Hopes; making it appear to the World, that the LORD is indeed <HI>their GOD,</HI> by exhibiting the Image of GOD upon them, a visible Resemblance of his moral Perfections. Let your Light so shine before Men, that they seeing your good Works, may glorify GOD in You: and thus shall Christ be magnify'd in your Body, whether it be by Life or Death, and in nothing shall you be ashamed, but you shall have Hope in Death, and Bold∣ness in the Day of Judgment, that great Day of our GOD, when He shall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the other and last Distinction I had in View.</P>
<P N="3">[3.] Consider <HI>Elijah</HI> as a faithful <HI>Prophet</HI> and emi∣nent Minister of Religion, so the LORD was <HI>his GOD</HI> in a still more emphatic Sense. Being brought very nigh to GOD, separated to special Service in the King∣dom of GOD by a peculiar Covenant (like that we read of, <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.8. <HI>the Covenant of</HI> Levi) being en∣dowed with Ministerial Gifts and Graces in a remarka∣ble Eminency, as also admitted to a distinguishing Intimacy of Friendship and Communion with the GOD of Heaven, and at the same time there being so <HI>few other</HI> faithful Prophets in the Land, that <HI>Elijah,</HI> even he <HI>only</HI> had seem'd to <HI>remain a Prophet of the Lord,</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="004140_0036_1003DB62188D9178"/>
at least in Compare with <HI>Baal</HI>'s Prophets, which ap∣pear'd in mighty Crowds at the famous Contest he had with them before <HI>Ahab</HI> and all the People) upon these Considerations <HI>Elijah</HI> might well have this singular Honour put upon him, to have the LORD called <HI>his GOD,</HI> the Lord God of <HI>Elijah.</HI></P>
<P>However, the Scriptures put the same Distinction on many others. Thus we hear Him call'd the Lord God of <HI>Shem,</HI> the God of <HI>Aaron,</HI> the God of <HI>Daniel,</HI> and other Prophets. And this Honour is extended to the faithful Prophets in general, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.6. <HI>The LORD GOD of the holy Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>Now this, I think, is safely applicable (tho' in lower Respects) concerning <HI>ordinary,</HI> as well as extraordinary Prophets. The faithful Ministers of Christ (tho' not furnish'd with miraculous Gifts and Powers) may be call'd <HI>holy Prophets:</HI> and it's no Presumption to claim <HI>Elijah</HI>'s GOD for <HI>the LORD their GOD.</HI> It is observa∣ble, <HI>John Baptist,</HI> tho' he did not the Miracles which <HI>Elijah</HI> is famous for, yet Christ pronounces him <HI>more than a Prophet,</HI> greater even than <HI>Elias,</HI> who was but a Type &amp; Figure of <HI>John:</HI> yet at the same time he adds, <HI>Notwithstanding, he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven, is greater than he</HI>; which Passage (tho' judiciously thought by some to have a confin'd Respect, as spoken by Christ of <HI>himself</HI>) is apply'd by many Expositors as spoken of the least Saint or the least Minister under the <HI>Christian</HI> Dispensation; and so apply'd, it is true, of the <HI>faithful Minister</HI> especially, in some Regards. However, Gos∣pel-Ministers in common being Divinely intitled <HI>Pro∣phets,</HI> we need make no Scruple of applying to the Case of faithful Pastors and Teachers, that remarkable Scripture, <HI>The Lord God of the holy Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>Here I may say distinctly, tho' very briefly,</P>
<P N="1">1. The LORD may be call'd the GOD of Ministers in general, as they are by their special Character and Calling <HI>Men of God</HI>; in an eminent Manner separated
<PB N="29" REF="004140_0037_1003DB69745D78C8"/>
from the World, and placed as Pillars in the House of the living GOD; dedicated to a peculiar Ministry for the Interest and Honour of GOD in his Church; commissioned in the Word of GOD, and call'd in the Providence of GOD, and by the Spirit of GOD fur∣nish'd and spirited to their sacred Employment; which is to manage (in GOD's Name) a Treaty of Peace with Rebel-Mankind, shewing Sinners the Way of Salvation, and praying them in CHRIST's Stead (as tho' GOD did beseech 'em by us) that they would be reconcil'd to GOD; to instruct in the Truths of GOD, and inculcate the Precepts of GOD; to warn, reprove, exhort, and comfort the People of GOD, according to their respective Cases, and according to the Tenour of the Gospel of GOD; to administer the holy Seals of GOD's Covenant; to lead in the publick Devotions to GOD; to go before his People in an Example of all holy Conversation, and a lively Walk with GOD. And thus being by their <HI>Character</HI> and <HI>Office,</HI> eminent Pro∣fessors of Religion, and peculiarly the Servants of GOD, He may very properly be call'd the LORD GOD of Evangelical Ministers in general now, in some sort as He was of <HI>Elijah</HI> and the ancient Prophets. Indeed worldly and carnally-minded vicious Ministers, it's confess'd, are some of the worst of Mortals; and as having corrupted the Covenant of <HI>Levi,</HI> deserve to be abandon'd of GOD and Man: Yet while Ministers are in Behaviour as becometh Godliness, however their Hearts mayn't be right with God, they are still to be held in Reputation by us as being by their Station and Character <HI>Men of God,</HI> and visibly related to GOD as in a high Sense <HI>their GOD.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. He is the LORD GOD of his <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>faithful</HI> Ministers in a particular Manner and in a very supe∣rior Sense.</P>
<P>For (in the <HI>first</HI> place) Such do very eminently <HI>ac∣knowledge</HI> and <HI>glorify GOD</HI> as the <HI>LORD their GOD.</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="004140_0038_1003B8A0D9F9BFF0"/>
They are true and upright Witnesses <HI>for GOD,</HI> in the midst of a crooked and perverse Generation, as <HI>Elijah,</HI> who was very jealous for the LORD God of <HI>Israel,</HI> and boldly stood up for Him against the Prophets of <HI>Baal,</HI> an apostate People, and an ungodly Court.— So they are much <HI>with GOD</HI>; giving themselves to Pray∣er, as well as to the Ministry of the Word, and having their Conversation in Heaven.— They carry about with them much of the <HI>Image</HI> of GOD, and make it the Business of their Life to bring peculiar Revenues of Glory to His <HI>Name,</HI> by paying Him their own active Homages, and by persuading all about them into due Acknowledgements of Him. — And in Proportion to the Vigour and Activity of Grace in them and the Supply of the Spirit of Christ, they are in Fact special <HI>Instruments</HI> of promoting the <HI>Kingdom</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD.— In these Regards every faith∣ful Minister may be saluted with the same exalted Title, as the Apostle gave to his own Son in the Faith (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.11.) <HI>O MAN of GOD!</HI> And indeed the same Apostle seems to apply this as the genuine Cha∣racter of good Ministers in Common (2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.17.) <HI>That the MAN of GOD may be perfect.</HI> Surely this is sufficient to justify the Application of that other Text as concerning them, <HI>The LORD GOD of the holy Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>But further (in the <HI>second</HI> place) Such are in very signal Ways <HI>own'd</HI> and <HI>honour'd</HI> of GOD, as those that are his peculiar Servants, and especially related to Him as the LORD <HI>their</HI> GOD. As He has call'd them to special Work, and claims a special Propriety in them: So He extends a peculiar Favour to them, and bestows peculiar Honours upon them, expressing Himself their GOD in an emphatical Sense many Ways. He ap∣pear'd the LORD GOD of <HI>Elijah</HI> and the inspir'd Pro∣phets by Instances of Favour and Honour done them, which were as extraordinary as their Commission and
<PB N="31" REF="004140_0039_1003DB6AFA6BD750"/>
their Gifts: But still his ordinary faithful Prophets are own'd and bless'd of GOD in Ways more common, yet usually remarkable, and sometimes very Singular. They have the Special Presence of GOD with them, in their several Measures. They are the special Care of his Fatherly Providence, and have holy Angels invisibly ministring to them. They have the Spirit of GOD and of Glory resting upon them, and supplying 'em with Divine Light, Grace, and Comfort, in various Degrees, as it pleaseth Him, and sometimes very admirably, in their own Sense and in the Apprehension of others. How have they at some Seasons experienc'd very ap∣parently the Communion of the Holy Ghost, in a high Degree! How has the Spirit of Supplication been pour'd out upon 'em, that (like <HI>Elias</HI>) they have pray'd earnestly! And how has GOD honour'd them by signal Answers of Prayer! And in pleading his Cause, how has He sometimes given them a Mouth and Wisdom, a Courage and Zeal, that the Adversary cou'd not re∣sist! How have their Hearts flamed out in fervent Love to Christ, their whole Souls been fir'd with a holy Indignation against Error and Wickedness, and their melted Bowels gush'd out in the tendered Com∣passions to poor perishing Sinners! They have some∣times appear'd full of GOD, in their Divine Temper and Conduct: and have had GOD manifestly <HI>with</HI> them in their Work, standing by 'em in their spiritual En∣counters, strengthning them to fulfil their sacred Mi∣nistry, and distinguishing them by making 'em the joyful Instruments of supporting and promoting the Profession, Love, and Practice of Religion, and thereby the Interest and Honour of GOD in the World! What conspicuous Testimonies from Heaven have some of GOD's faithful Ministers receiv'd, in the extraordinary Success visibly attending their Labours for the Conver∣sion of Sinners, and the Edification of Saints! And when at last call'd off the Stage of Time, how glori∣ously
<PB N="32" REF="004140_0040_1003DB729B197448"/>
have the Scenes of a holy and useful Life shut up in a serene and peaceful, if not joyful and triumphant Death!— Shall we not own now, that JEHOVAH is <HI>the LORD GOD of the holy Prophets,</HI> in a blessed transcendent Sense, very visibly in the present World?</P>
<P>Yet it must be remember'd, even all this do's not take in the complete Scope and Intention of those com∣prehensive Words, <HI>The LORD GOD of</HI> Elijah: But the Expression has a further View, and reaches to <HI>ano∣ther</HI> and <HI>better</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> World. <HI>Elisha</HI> (in our Text) looks beyond the present Life, and even after the Pro∣phet's <HI>Departure</HI> out of this temporal State adores God as still the LORD GOD of <HI>Elijah.</HI> In Truth, 'tis espe∣cially with an Eye to a better Country, that is, an <HI>hea∣venly,</HI> into which the Saints are translated finally, that <HI>GOD is</HI> said to be <HI>not ashamed to be called their GOD:</HI> There it is that He bestows <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 'em perfect Happi∣ness and Glory, according to the full Emphasis of this big Expression. And in that blessed upper World holy <HI>Prophets</HI> have <HI>distinguishing</HI> Rewards assign'd them. None indeed was ever (that we know of) translated thi∣ther in a Chariot of Fire, and without seeing Death, save <HI>Elijah</HI> and <HI>Enoch,</HI> and perhaps few have a greater Re∣ward in Heaven: Yet every <HI>Saint</HI> arrives as safe, under the Conduct of good Angels, in the World of happy Spirits, tho' by the common and inferior Road of Mor∣tality, and every faithful <HI>Prophet</HI> meets a glorious signal Reward in the Mansions above. In the City of God there are different Degrees of Happiness, a Diversity of Privileges and Honours. And the blessed God will decree a very advanced Glory and Felicity to his holy Prophets, discriminating them in their future Recompen∣ces, in Proportion to the varying Measures of their present Improvements in real Holiness, and of their in∣tended Services, if not their actual Usefulness in this World. <HI>Peter,</HI> an inspired Prophet and Apostle, not only hopes himself to be a Partaker of the future Glory,
<PB N="33" REF="004140_0041_1003B8A8B13D54D8"/>
but assures the faithful <HI>Elders</HI> and uninspired Prophets, that when the CHIEF SHEPHERD shall appear, <HI>They</HI> also shall receive a <HI>Crown of Glory</HI> which fadeth not away: and it will, as to many, be a very rich and refulgent Crown, a <HI>far more exceeding</HI> (as well as <HI>eternal)</HI> Weight of Glory. As the aspectable Heavens in their several Parts vary to our Eye in their Degrees of Light and Splendor: So likewise is it with the Saints in their se∣parate State, and in the Resurrection-World. <HI>They</HI> (says the Prophet) <HI>that are wise</HI> (wise to Salvation of their own Souls) <HI>shall shine as the Brightness of the</HI> FIR∣MAMENT (which is a great, yet fainter Brightness) <HI>and they that have turned many to Righteousness</HI> (so approving themselves wise to win others Souls) <HI>shall shine forth as the STARS</HI> (with a superiour and more remarkable Lustre) <HI>for ever and ever.</HI> The SUN of Righteousness will shine on such with his superlatively splendid and be∣nign Rays: and the SAVIOUR will express the GOD to them in a most transcendent Manner, by possessing them of the sublimest Happiness, and transforming them into the Image of his own Glory, with a peculiar Perfection and Eminence that shall put a visible eternal Distinction upon them.</P>
<P>And now the happy Thought we have been dwel∣ling upon, might be improv'd to a great Variety of ex∣cellent practical Purposes, in a large APPLICATION: But I shall suggest only the following important Con∣clusions.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here's Matter of Encouragement and of Awak∣ning to the <HI>Children</HI> of the <HI>Prophets</HI>; I mean their <HI>natu∣ral</HI> Off-spring. Such are eminently Children of the <HI>Covenant:</HI> and by their Fathers very high Profession, and near Relation to GOD, are themselves also visibly brought nigh to Him. The <HI>Promise</HI> is to them, at least in common with other the Children of religious Parents; for the Blessing of <HI>Abraham</HI> is come upon the believing <HI>Gentiles, I will be a GOD to Thee and to thy

Seed:</HI> And while they wait on the LORD, they may encourage their <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> by an Application of this great and precious Promise. But then at the same time it shou'd awaken a holy <HI>Fear</HI> in their Souls, to consider the awful <HI>Vows</HI> of God which are upon them.</P>
<P>Tho' the Children of Ministers in Gospel-Days are not <HI>holy to the LORD,</HI> in the same peculiar Sense, as were the Sons of <HI>Levi</HI> under the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Dispensation: yet they are so in a Sense, at least in that common to all Children of <HI>Christian</HI> Parents; separated from a World lying in Wickedness, externally call'd with an holy Vocation, devoted to GOD as his visible Children, and engag'd to honour Him by all <HI>Christian</HI> Duty and Ser∣vice. Yea, the <HI>Minister</HI>'s Standing in the Church of God (as well as the Advantage of an Education in a Family well-order'd, as his ought to be) seems to raise and increase the solemn Obligations upon <HI>his</HI> Children to a very virtuous, holy and heavenly Life. It's re∣quir'd of the <HI>Bishop</HI> (1 Tim. 3.4.) <HI>That he rule well his own House, having his Children in Subjection with all Gra∣vity</HI>; and (Tit. 1.6.) <HI>Having faithful Children:</HI> which not only speaks the Parent's Obligation, but hints also the <HI>Chil∣dren</HI>'s Duty. As it is expected of Ministers, that they shew themselves Patterns of good Works in general, and of re∣lative Duties in particular: so it's expected, that <HI>their Fa∣milies</HI> (above all the Families in <HI>Israel)</HI> be Patterns of De∣votion, Order, Unity, Sobriety, Gravity. We would then command our Housholds to keep the Way of the LORD. O our Children, in particular, we exhort you to be <HI>faithful Children,</HI> and to labour for <HI>all Gravity,</HI> in Thought and Temper, in Speech and Behaviour. We warn and beseech you in the Name of Christ and by the Love of Christ, see to it, that you do in the first place sincerely chuse and avouch the GOD of your Fathers for <HI>your GOD,</HI> and then that you <HI>walk before Him and be perfect, walk worthy of Him,</HI> and as becometh your Baptismal Engagements, your religious Descent, and
<PB N="35" REF="004140_0043_1003DB7942876E30"/>
ministerial Parentage. Verily the Glory of GOD, the Interest of CHRIST, the Honour of the <HI>Ministry,</HI> the Fame of <HI>New England,</HI> the Credit and Comfort of your anxious <HI>Parents,</HI> your <HI>own</HI> Reputation and Usefulness, present Peace and future Happiness, and the united Ex∣pectations both of <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth</HI> from you, are all very weighty and forcible Arguments, conspiring with one Voice, to demand and urge your thoughtful Solici∣tude, earnest Prayer, and active Use of all proper Means, that you may be found <HI>early</HI> and <HI>faithful</HI> Keepers of GOD's holy <HI>Covenant.</HI> O let that be the upright, present and persevering Profession and Resolution of your Souls (Exod. 15.2.) <HI>The LORD is my GOD, and I will prepare Him an Habitation; my Fathers GOD, and I will exalt Him.</HI> Read and apply the Royal Saint's dying Charge to his Son <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 CHRON. 28.9. Together with that very quickning Word from the Mouth of your blessed Saviour, PROV. 8.17.— Turn down the Leaves where you find the Places in your Bible, and make these Texts particularly familiar to you, often and closely meditating upon 'em, and praying over them. O that the blessed SPIRIT of Grace may set in with the Words, and give them a powerful and lasting Impression on your Souls! — And for the Direction of your general Conduct, I recom∣mend to your frequent Perusal (among other Parts of Scripture) that very copious, the' short Chapter, the Second in the Epistle to <HI>Titus.</HI></P>
<P>[And now on this Occasion I wou'd apply what has been said more particularly to <HI>my own Children,</HI> and take the Opportunity in this publick manner to leave my most solemn Charges upon them. Hear, <HI>my Chil∣dren!</HI> You will easily believe me when I tell you, <HI>GOD is my Record, how greatly I long after you all in the Bowels of Jesus Christ.</HI> And now I command and ex∣hort You by the Lord Jesus Christ, I warn and charge You now before GOD and the World, that You <HI>observe
<PB N="36" REF="004140_0044_1003DB7E4B122310"/>
these Things,</HI> and have 'em always in Remembrance: that You make it your <HI>first</HI> Care to <HI>win Christ</HI> and secure an Interest in GOD as <HI>your GOD</HI> in <HI>Christ,</HI> and then that You govern your whole Life and Practice in a just Conformity to the holy Religion You profess; deeply concern'd, and very vigilant, <HI>that the Name of GOD and his Doctrine may</HI> never <HI>be blasphemed through YOU.</HI> Thus You may hope for the gracious Presence of GOD with You, which is the only Source of all true Pros∣perity. That was the Sum of <HI>David</HI>'s passionate Wish for his beloved <HI>Solomon</HI> (1 Chron. 22.11.) <HI>Now, my Son, the LORD be with thee, and prosper thou!</HI> And in the believing prospect of this, he cou'd chearfully die, and leave him: for that was his Hope, when going the Way of all the Earth, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28.20. David <HI>said to</HI> Solomon <HI>his Son, Be strong, and of good Courage, and do it; for the LORD God, even MY God, will be with thee, He will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</HI>]</P>
<P>But to proceed in our Improvement of the Point;</P>
<P N="2">2. This affords Direction and Incentive to <HI>Candi∣dates</HI> for the Ministry, in their preparing for and en∣tring into it. Undoubtedly, as the Apostle observes, This is a true Saying, <HI>If any Man desire the Office of a Bishop</HI> (or Gospel-Minister) <HI>he desireth a GOOD Work</HI>; a Work good in <HI>it self,</HI> and good in its <HI>Ten∣dency,</HI> acceptable to GOD, and profitable to Men, de∣lightful in its Nature, and happy in its <HI>future</HI> Reward. We may well think, 'tis very pleasing in the Eyes of GOD to see any <HI>desiring</HI> this Office (so nearly relating to His own Kingdom and Interest) if their Thoughts be <HI>uprightly</HI> bent upon it, as well as their Genius and Talents suited to it; if they have indeed given their <HI>Hearts</HI> to the LORD, taken hold of his Covenant, and chosen Him for <HI>their GOD</HI> in Christ: Such unquestio∣nably have just Grounds to look on themselves Divinely call'd to the Work, and may humbly hope in GOD▪ That He will bestow a Blessing on their Studies, to in∣crease
<PB N="37" REF="004140_0045_1003DB8049D4CCC8"/>
their Furniture of Knowledge, Prudence, and other a requisite Accomplishments for it; That He will open a Door for their regular Entrance into it; And that He will be with them in it, to direct, assist, and happily succeed them. Students in Divinity standing for the Evangelical Ministry, are not unfitly intitled <HI>Sons of the Prophets:</HI> and shou'd improve this their honorary Character, as loudly monitory to 'em of their incumbent Duty, to know and seek <HI>the LORD GOD of the holy Prophets.</HI> And they that (together with a becoming Care of Proficiency in useful human Learn∣ing) are solicitous, above all their Gettings, to get necessary <HI>Divine</HI> Knowledge, to get an Understanding enlighten'd and sanctify'd, to <HI>discern spiritual Things,</HI> and to <HI>know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of GOD,</HI> to <HI>behold the Lamb of GOD,</HI> to <HI>behold Him that is invisible,</HI> and to <HI>know Him that is True</HI>; they that <HI>begin</HI> here, and <HI>go on</HI> with this, do very hopefully bid fair to be <HI>good Ministers</HI> of Jesus Christ, and Workmen that shall <HI>not need to be asham'd</HI>; such really make the best Pre∣parations for Gospel-Service; they enter into it with the best Advantages; lay the best Foundation for Hope of Success in it, and of Peace in Life and Death; pro∣vide the best for a future Day of Accounts, and build strong for a happy Eternity. The <HI>Man in CHRIST</HI> will be emphatically the <HI>Man of GOD:</HI> and such an one the Apostle pronounces <HI>a Vessel unto Honour</HI>; a Vessel of Mercy prepared unto Glory, and in which GOD will make known the Riches of his Glory.</P>
<P>But if any dare thrust themselves into the Ministry, with∣out having first <HI>yielded themselves to the LORD</HI>; without having first <HI>learned CHRIST,</HI> and <HI>acquainted themselves with GOD</HI>; without having GOD enthron'd in their Hearts, and reigning over all the Powers of their Souls, over their whole internal Temper, Principles, Views and Thoughts, as well as external Life and Actions, having at best only the <HI>Form of Knowledge,</HI> without any
<PB N="38" REF="004140_0046_1003DB87BA52D4F8"/>
Vitality in it, and the <HI>Form of Godliness,</HI> without the Power of it; and consequently without the necessary Evidences of a real and saving Union to Christ, Stran∣gers to the <HI>Communion of the Holy Ghost,</HI> and to an experimental Sense of what it is to have the LORD for <HI>their GOD</HI>; surely such (how excellent soever a con∣templative Genius, and whatever intellectual Acquire∣ments, or moral Ornaments they may have, as so many plausible Marks of a Divine Mission, to recommend 'em in the Sight of <HI>Men)</HI> can never hope to <HI>shew them∣selves approved unto GOD,</HI> and must stand continually expos'd to the Resentments of an accusing Conscience, which will very probably be often whispering in their Ears those just and cutting Reproaches, <HI>Art thou a Master in</HI> Israel, <HI>and knowest not these things! Thou which teachest others, teachest thou not thy self!</HI>— Alas for the carnal graceless Minister, whose <HI>god</HI> is his <HI>Belly</HI> or the <HI>World,</HI> or whose Idol at best is <HI>Self,</HI> a false imaginary <HI>Pharisaical</HI> Self! how much more abundant Reason hath such an one very evidently (under his strong Symptoms, if not actual Sense, of an unregenerate Mind) than the holy inspir'd <HI>Apostle,</HI> to entertain the jealous Thought with a trembling Soul, which that humble Saint had his Heart so deeply affected with (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.27.) <HI>Lest that by any Means, when I have preach∣ed to others, I my self should be a CAST-AWAY!</HI>— This awful Text stands at the Pulpit-Door as <HI>a flaming Sword which turneth every way,</HI> to guard it from the rude Incroachments of every unhallow'd Foot. How little Account soever any may justly make of the pre∣tended Necessity of an uninterrupted Line of Succession from the Apostles, and an authoritative human Com∣mission from Episcopal Hands in Virtue thereof, to the Being of holy Orders; yet certainly Persons of any solid Reflection must allow, that the holy Nature and Ends of the Work of the Ministry, the holy Qualifications of the Scripture-Bishop, and the holy Vows at his
<PB N="39" REF="004140_0047_1003DB8943DED458"/>
solemn Separation, the holy Eye of God upon the Preacher, and a holy future Reckoning, are Considerations which speak the Pulpit a very sacred Inclosure, not to be thrown open to all in Common, nor invaded by Persons essentially deficient, in their intellectual, or moral and religious Character. We may pertinently apply here that of the wise Man, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 5.1. <HI>Keep thy Foot when thou goest to the House of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the Sacrifice of Fools: for they consider not that they do evil.</HI> And that of the Apostle to <HI>Timothy</HI> (1 Epist. 5.21, 22.) <HI>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect Angels,—Lay Hands SUDDENLY on no Man, neither be Partaker of other Men's Sins; keep thy self pure:</HI> this (I say) is not only a solemn Caution to the <HI>Ordainer,</HI> but strongly implies likewise a Divine Warning to the <HI>Probationer,</HI> not to rush upon the Ministry <HI>suddenly</HI> and unprepar'd, ignorant or in his <HI>Sins.</HI> 1 Tim. 3.6. <HI>Not a Novice, lest being lifted up with Pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</HI>— But now says the Apostle, (2 <HI>Epist.</HI> 2.21.) <HI>If a Man purge himself from these, he shall be a Vessel unto Honour, sanctified and meet for the Master's Use, prepared unto every good Work.</HI></P>
<P>How fitly then may those Apostolical Exhortations be brought home to himself by every <HI>Candidate</HI> for the Ministry! <HI>"Thou therefore, My Son, flee these Things, flee youthful Lusts; but follow Righteousness, Godliness, Faith, Love, Patience, Meekness, Peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure Heart: Be strong in the Grace that is in JESUS CHRIST: Study to shew thy self approved unto GOD: Lay hold on eter∣nal Life".</HI>— And now he that observes and does these Things, will highly recommend himself to the tender Affection and Delight of his Fathers in the Ministry, as well as the People of God; and <HI>that</HI> will be their united earnest Wish for such an one, in the Language of the Apostle's comprehensive Benediction
<PB N="40" REF="004140_0048_1003DB8FB481F0B8"/>
on his <HI>dearly beloved Son</HI> (2 Tim. 4.22.) <HI>The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy Spirit! Amen.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Point before us might be apply'd to recom∣mend the <HI>Schools of the Prophets</HI>; Colleges or Academies for the training up meet Persons to be employ'd in the Ministry. Such we read of as being in <HI>Israel</HI> of Old, under the Inspection of the Prophets, <HI>Samuel, Eli∣jah,</HI> and <HI>Elisha:</HI> they are left on Record for an <HI>Exam∣ple</HI> to future Ages, and the <HI>Imitation</HI> thereof is doubtless very pleasing to the <HI>LORD GOD of the holy Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>A well-manag'd Education of Youth for the sacred Purpose of Gospel-Service must needs be highly <HI>ac∣ceptable unto GOD</HI> (and therefore ought to be <HI>approv'd of Men</HI>) for as <HI>His</HI> Institution has founded the <HI>Order</HI> of the Ministry, and that for a <HI>perpetual</HI> Continuance, so <HI>His</HI> Interest and Honour are not a little concern'd in the Introduction of <HI>such</HI> into it as hopefully exhibit the Character of <HI>Men of GOD; Men in Christ,</HI> and <HI>Men of Understanding,</HI> well study'd in the Theory of reveal'd Divinity, well stock'd with sound Scripture-Principles, <HI>apt to teach, able rightly to divide the Word of Truth, able also to convince Gainsayers,</HI> and resolv'd to <HI>fight the good Fight of Faith, rooted and grounded in the Love of Christ and in the Hope of the Gospel,</HI> avouching the Lord for <HI>their GOD,</HI> and under the credible Marks of a sincerely dispos'd (together with a well-furnish'd) Mind, devoting themselves to the Busi∣ness of <HI>winning Souls</HI> to Christ, that <HI>others also</HI> may have the LORD for their Covenant-GOD. The Stu∣dent thus <HI>nourish'd up in the Words of Faith and of good Doctrine,</HI> and <HI>knowing how he ought to behave himself in the House of God,</HI> may truly be said to <HI>purchase to himself a good Degree,</HI> in the Church as well as the School: and how acceptable in the Sight of GOD, how happy the Nurseries of Learning, that are wisely go∣vern'd with a steady and prevailing View to this their principal Design, the qualifying of Youth with <HI>sacred
<PB N="41" REF="004140_0049_1003DB9138C595A8"/>
Knowledge,</HI> and forming the <HI>Christian,</HI> as well as the Scholar! The Excellency and Advantage of such an Education, and the important Duty of Tutors and Stu∣dents in the publick School (as well as of Parents and Children in the private Family) are pointed out in those remarkable Passages of the Apostle to <HI>Timothy,</HI> 2 Epist. 3.14,—17. which I will leave you to consult your Bible for: and pass to observe,</P>
<P N="4">4. The present Doctrine suggests one apparent Rea∣son of <HI>Satan</HI>'s Malice and Rage against the <HI>Gospel-Ministry.</HI> Against this his Heart burns with Indigna∣tion: against this he levels the whole Artillery of the Kingdom of Darkness. He abhors the Business, and hates the Design of the Ministry; he dreads the Success of it; he envies and maligns the Persons employ'd <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it, and in special the more faithful, active and zealous of the Order: he confronts them with all his hellish Arts and Powers, has his Emissaries abroad continually, is ever laying unhappy Snares for them, and indefatigably carries on the most vigorous Opposition to them. Hence the Divine Apostle himself complains that <HI>Satan hin∣der'd him,</HI> and that such as were the Devil's Tools <HI>did him much Evil,</HI> and <HI>greatly withstood him.</HI> Now what must be the <HI>Principle</HI> lying at the bottom of this Spite at Ministers, this accursed Malignity against their Per∣sons, their Office and Labours? It arises doubtless chiefly from his inveterate Hatred of GOD and the LAMB, <HI>whose they are and whom they serve.</HI> He's full of Rage at the <HI>Captain</HI> of our Salvation, and there∣fore can't but vent his Malice upon <HI>the good Soldier of Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. This Point affords abundant <HI>Consolation</HI> and <HI>Coun∣sel</HI> to the <HI>Ministers</HI> of Christ.</P>
<P>This directs and calls them to see to it, that they make sure of GOD for <HI>their GOD</HI> in Truth and Reality, and that they make it their Care to carry it in all Regards as becomes the Dignity and Sacredness

of the Relation they stand into GOD. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.11. <HI>But thou, O</HI> MAN <HI>of GOD, flee these Things, and follow after Righteousness, Godliness,</HI> &amp;c. They should study to exhibit the Character of <HI>Men of GOD</HI> in their whole Ministry and Life, in their public Work, and private Walk. How humble, lowly and self-denying shou'd they be! how kindly affection'd and endear'd to one another! how compassionate to the Souls of Sin∣ners! how delighted with the Image of GOD on his Saints! how spiritually minded, devout and prayerful! how thoughtful of GOD, zealous for his Honour, and fervent in Spirit, serving the LORD! how resolv'd and how vigilant against the Powers of Darkness, the Enemies of GOD and Enemies of all Righteousness! how bold in their GOD, to espouse his Cause, and vin∣dicate his Truths and Ways! how attach'd to their Divine Master's Instructions and Orders, careful to shew all good Fidelity in speaking from the Mouth of the LORD, neither going beyond his Word, and so being wise above what is written, nor yet shunning to declare the whole Counsel of GOD! All this Duty their Pro∣fession dictates, and their Relation to God invites to. Are they professedly <HI>Men of GOD,</HI> and will He be a GOD to the faithful Prophets? What a powerful <HI>Mo∣tive</HI> is this to put them upon thus taking Heed to themselves, that they fulfil their Ministry! and how abundantly improvable for their <HI>Direction</HI> in it!</P>
<P>What <HI>refreshing</HI> Prospects and Reflections may this af∣ford the faithful Servant of GOD! Is the LORD indeed <HI>his GOD?</HI> then how joyful may he be in the Con∣sideration of his Interest in all the precious Promises of the Gospel, and his Security against all the dreadful Menaces of the Law! How joyful in the Sense of a gracious Pardon, of the Justification of Life, the Adop∣tion of Sons, present persevering Grace, and future everlasting Glory! Is the LORD verily <HI>Elijah</HI>'s <HI>GOD?</HI> How little Reason has he to be discourag'd by any
<PB N="43" REF="004140_0051_1003DB9446EE5678"/>
Oppositions from Earth or Hell! W<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> tho' <HI>Ahab</HI> persecute him as the Troubler of <HI>Israel,</HI> and what tho' <HI>Jezebel</HI> be his sworn Enemy? If GOD be for him and with him, what can Men or Devils do unto him! His GOD will certainly be his <HI>Shield</HI> in Danger, his <HI>Sup∣port</HI> in Affliction, his <HI>Light</HI> in Darkness, his <HI>Defence</HI> against the Reproaches of the Enemy, his <HI>Guide</HI> and <HI>Help</HI> in the Course of his ministerial Work and reli∣gious Walk, the <HI>Strength</HI> of his Life, and his <HI>Hope</HI> in Death. The <HI>holy Prophets,</HI> in a believing View of GOD as <HI>their GOD,</HI> who is nigh to them at all times and who will never leave them, may have <HI>strong Con∣solation</HI> and <HI>good Hope through Grace:</HI> and while they shew themselves <HI>approved unto GOD,</HI> they need not be asham'd of the Gospel, nor afraid of their Adver∣saries, nor even in Terror of Death, the last Enemy. For the <HI>God of their Life</HI> will preserve them, that every one shall <HI>accomplish as an Hireling his Day:</HI> and when they have finish'd their Work, their Reward above will be sure and great; a Thought which must needs be sufficient to reconcile them to Death, and make them easy under all Events of Life.</P>
<P>These are some of the glorious and blessed Consi∣derations, which that Minister, whose GOD is the Lord, has in the midst of all his worldly Wants and spiritual Cares, Trials, and Exercises whatsoever, to refresh his weary Soul. By them he may and shou'd encourage him∣self, when (as <HI>Elijah,</HI> who was a Man subject to like Passions with us) he is ready to faint in his holy War∣fare. By them shou'd he animate his Faith, invigorate his Hopes, and fortify his Courage; and by them in∣flame his Zeal, quicken his Alacrity, and prompt his Diligence in the Service of GOD: Yea, under the most melancholy Thought of a Ministry <HI>unsuccessful,</HI> he may thus quiet his anxious Spirit, as the holy Prophet amidst his Tears on the like sad Ocasion (Isa. 49.4, 5.) <HI>Surely my Judgment is with the LORD, and
<PB N="44" REF="004140_0052_1003DB98C6127D38"/>
my Work with My GOD. Tho'</HI> Israel <HI>be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the Eyes of the LORD, and my GOD shall be my Strength.</HI>— So the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> tells us his happy Experience and triumphant Assu∣rance (2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.7,—18.) <HI>I have fought a good Fight,— henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown.— All Men forsook me; notwithstanding, the LORD stood with me, and strengthned me,— and the LORD will pre∣serve me to his heavenly Kingdom: Unto whom be Glory for ever and ever! Amen.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Hence we may collect much of the <HI>Duty</HI> incum∣bent upon <HI>Christians</HI> in respect of the <HI>Gospel-Ministry,</HI> and a powerful Argument to recommend this <HI>Order</HI> of Men to the Love and Esteem of the <HI>World</HI> in general.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Is JEHOVAH the GOD of <HI>Elijah?</HI> Is He the <HI>LORD GOD of the holy Prophets?</HI> How then shou'd <HI>all Men</HI> every where, that have any Sense of the Being of GOD, entertain his Ministers with thankful chearful Hearts; whom He now sends, not to the <HI>Jews</HI> only, but together with them unto the <HI>Gentiles!</HI> How incon∣sistent, how senseless, absurd and mad the common Prejudices of a blind and wicked World against this Order of Persons! Behold, <HI>these Men are the Servants of the most high GOD, which shew unto us the Way of Salvation!</HI> A significant and attractive Character, that justly invites Affection and Complacence, and should make them welcome to all the perishing Sons of <HI>Adam.</HI> As it is written (Isa. 52.7.) <HI>How beautiful are the Feet of Them that preach the Gospel of Peace, that publish Salvation, that say unto</HI> Zion, <HI>Thy GOD reign∣eth!</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) This points out the Obligation upon <HI>Christian</HI> Professors, in chusing the Place of their <HI>Habitation,</HI> to fix (if possible) where they may have the Advantage of a <HI>Gospel-Ministry</HI>; at the same time it loudly re∣bukes them who for worldly Accommodations <HI>forsake
<PB N="45" REF="004140_0053_1003DBA24C839D00"/>
the Levite, and the House of God:</HI> And this infers too the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of those that prefer the Ministry of such as have most of the <HI>Image</HI> of GOD shining upon 'em, and most of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of GOD visibly breathing in them; But it detects the <HI>Folly</HI> of Those who (meerly out of a fond Humour for some little differing For∣malities in Worship and Discipline, out of an angry Pique, or for some trifling Convenience, or other fri∣volous Pretence) will easily forsake and cast off a Ministry own'd of GOD, by the sensible Tokens of his special Presence and Blessing, and perhaps come to give up all Regard for it, yea lose even all Charity to it, as a regular and faithful Christian Ministry; while yet they can glory in others, it may be, who have at least as little of GOD appearing in their Character and Ministry, have as little of the Truth of the Gos∣pel with them, as little of the true Genius of Christi∣anity in their Preaching, and as little of the Power of Religion in their Devotion and Practice. Hear how the Apostle rebukes this unhappy Spirit of Schism and Envy (1 Cor. 3.4,—7.) <HI>For while one saith, I am of</HI> Paul; <HI>and another, I am of</HI> Apollos; <HI>are ye not carnal? Who is</HI> Paul, <HI>and who</HI> Apollos, <HI>but Ministers, by whom ye believed, even as the LORD gave to every Man? So then neither is</HI> the one <HI>nor</HI> the other <HI>any Thing; but GOD, who giveth the Increase.</HI> And in some fol∣lowing Words he thus exhorts them, <HI>Covet earnestly the best Gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent Way;— Follow after Charity, Let all your Things be done with Charity. And the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you: My Love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) The present Doctrine serves for Direction to the <HI>Churches</HI> of Christ in their <HI>Election</HI> of Persons into the Relation of Bishops or Pastors among them; which is undoubtedly their Right, by the Laws of Reason, and the Tenour of Scripture, and justify'd by ancient
<PB N="46" REF="004140_0054_1003B8B428F9B348"/>
Usage: but if they wou'd employ this their Privilege and Power with Wisdom and with Success, they must in the first Place look and seek to <HI>the LORD GOD of the holy Prophets</HI> for his Guidance in the important Affair. As when a People have receiv'd the Blessing of a <HI>Man set over the Congregation, to go in and out before them,</HI> that is an able and faithful <HI>Minister for the House of their GOD,</HI> they shou'd give GOD the <HI>Praise</HI>; (Ezra 8.18.) <HI>By the good Hand of our GOD upon us, they brought us a Man of Understanding:</HI> So likewise in the <HI>Want</HI> of such a Blessing, GOD expects by <HI>Prayer</HI> to be sought to for it. We have that primitive Example left on Record for our Imitation in <HI>this</HI> Regard; Act. 1.24. <HI>They prayed, and said, Thou LORD, which knowest the Hearts of all Men, shew whether of these two THOU hast chosen.</HI>— And then in forming their Judgment and Choice, they must be careful to conduct themselves by <HI>Scripture-Rule,</HI> which states the just <HI>Character</HI> of a christian Bishop or Elder very parti∣cularly: upon an Examination of which it will be obvious, that a Regard is to be had to his Qualifica∣tions <HI>moral,</HI> as well as intellectual, to his <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>divine</HI> Endowments, as well as rational Talents and human Virtues. Such an one stands <HI>first</HI> recommend∣ed, who hath chosen the LORD GOD of the Prophets for <HI>his GOD,</HI> and who hath most of the Spirit of the <HI>holy Prophets</HI> visibly resting upon him, the Spirit of <HI>Prayer,</HI> the Spirit of <HI>Love</HI> and of <HI>Power</HI> and of a <HI>sound Mind</HI>; who hath obtained like <HI>precious Faith,</HI> and who adds to Faith <HI>Knowledge,</HI> especially Knowledge <HI>Theolo∣gical,</HI> both practical and experimental, as well as specula∣tive. And to such an one surely the thinking serious Christian will be ready to say, as the Woman to <HI>Elijah</HI> (1 Kin. 17.24.) <HI>Now know I by this, that thou art a MAN of GOD.</HI> Of such an one it may most probably be hop'd, <HI>that the Word of the LORD in his Mouth is Truth:</HI> and such an one is the most likely to have GOD <HI>with him</HI> in his whole Ministry.</P>

The Consideration of GOD, <HI>before whom they stand,</HI> should govern a People in their <HI>Conduct</HI> towards such as <HI>are over them in the LORD</HI>; and it teaches them to <HI>esteem 'em very highly in Love for their Work's sake.</HI> Their very Work and Office, and the external Relation they bear to GOD and to his People, may well endear 'em to every considerate serious Soul: but especially the <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>good</HI> Minister, who is inter∣nally related to GOD as <HI>his GOD,</HI> as well as united with the People of God as <HI>his</HI> People by the common Bond of the Spirit, he who in his Labours and Life shews himself <HI>approv'd</HI> unto GOD, and commends him∣self to <HI>every Man's Conscience</HI> in the Sight of GOD, such an one is truly and eminently <HI>worthy of double Ho∣nour.</HI> He himself <HI>seeks</HI> the Honour that comes from GOD; yet <HI>deserves</HI> Esteem from <HI>Men:</HI> nor indeed can he but desire an Interest in their Affections, with a View to their greater Satisfaction in his Ministry and better Edification by it. And this we know, that if we have but your <HI>Hearts</HI> engag'd to us upon right Principles, <HI>inward Love</HI> will (in proportion to its real Prevalence) dictate <HI>outward Respect,</HI> and forbid all un∣worthy Slights, unkind Neglects and Discouragements. <HI>Obadiah</HI> shewed how <HI>greatly he feared GOD,</HI> when he express'd the tender Care and Bowels of a <HI>Father</HI> to the <HI>Sons of the Prophets,</HI> and when to the <HI>Father</HI> of the Prophets he paid the Veneration and Duty of a <HI>Son</HI>: as you may read, 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 18.7,—13.</P>
<P>There's a <HI>Variety</HI> of Ways, in which People may exhibit their just and friendly Regards to the Ministry. They shou'd maintain worthy Thoughts of the <HI>Office,</HI> for its Relation to GOD, and Importance to Men; shou'd diligently attend on the public <HI>Adminstration</HI> of it, and that in all the several Branches thereof, waiting upon GOD in all his Ordinances <HI>in Season and out of Season</HI>; shou'd joyn in Divine <HI>Worship</HI> with Se∣riousness and exemplary Devotion, and receive the
<PB N="48" REF="004140_0056_1003DBA75E43F878"/>
<HI>Word</HI> with Meekness, a grave Attention, and faithful Self-Application; shou'd subject themselves to the re∣gular Acts of Ecclesiastical <HI>Discipline,</HI> and carefully sup∣port all <HI>Gospel-Order</HI>; cultivate <HI>Peace</HI> and a holy <HI>Unity</HI> among themselves, that <HI>the Gospel mayn't be hindred</HI>; and do all in their Power to <HI>encourage</HI> the Hearts, and <HI>strengthen</HI> the Hands of their Ministers, while <HI>watching for their Souls, as they that must give an Account</HI>: help 'em by a comfortable and decent <HI>Maintenance,</HI> by an amicable and open <HI>Correspondence</HI> with them, by affec∣tionate and obliging <HI>Carriage</HI> towards them on all Occasions, and by fervent daily <HI>Prayers</HI> in the Family and Closet for them: But above all, they are desirous to see their People <HI>edify'd</HI> by their Ministry, <HI>profiting</HI> by their public Labours and private Visits; so will they <HI>thank GOD, and take Courage,</HI> whatever Infirmi∣ties, Difficulties, Temptations, they may have to con∣flict with in this present evil World.</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> when the Man of God <HI>dies</HI> and leaves the World, he should be follow'd to his Grave with all suitable Marks of publick Respect, and his Memory receive all proper Honours. The Consideration of his special Relation to GOD, and of the special Presence of the LORD his GOD with him, shou'd awaken very serious Thoughts in Survivors, and awe our Minds into a solemn Pensiveness, and holy Mourning: for not to resent the Death of such an one, wou'd be at once an Indignity to his Memory, and Ingratitude to GOD, the LORD his GOD, who display'd his own Being and Per∣fections to us in the Gifts and Graces of his Servant, and us'd and honour'd him to be an Instrument of bring∣ing many Blessings to us, as well as keeping off Judg∣ments from us.</P>
<P>When a faithful Minister dies <HI>among</HI> his People, as their <HI>Loss</HI> is great, their <HI>Sorrow</HI> should be in Propor∣tion. When an <HI>Elijah</HI> departs, well may they (with <HI>Elisha</HI>) express their Grief in all the Gestures and Ac∣cents
<PB N="49" REF="004140_0057_1003DBA8E6EF4518"/>
of a <HI>bitter Lamentation</HI>: Yet in the midst of their disquieting Thoughts they have this for their <HI>Consola∣tion,</HI> that as their faithful MINISTER is translated to a <HI>better</HI> World (for whither else can the <HI>holy Prophet</HI> be taken?) so the LORD his GOD still lives and remains among them, <HI>with whom is the Residue of the Spirit.</HI> While then they are <HI>weeping for themselves and for their Children,</HI> and while they pay their mournful Respects to the Memory of the Dead, they may make the <HI>living God</HI> their Confidence, and trust in Him to repair the Breach made upon them.</P>
<P>And a People are call'd to take a solemn Notice of the Dispensation of Providence, when any Man of God is taken out of the World, who had <HI>formerly</HI> stood in a Pastoral Relation to them. All Survivors shou'd lay to Heart the Death of any publickly useful and pious Person: and when such an one has once been related to us so nearly in the Station of a <HI>Pastor</HI> over us, it can't but be own'd the highest <HI>Condecency,</HI> that we <HI>di∣stinguish</HI> ourselves among the <HI>Mourners</HI> at his Fune∣ral, and pay very singular Respects to his <HI>Memory</HI> in all proper Ways.</P>
<P><HI>AND here filial Duty commands me to make a re∣spectful Mention of that</HI> Man of GOD, <HI>the Reverend Mr.</HI> BENJAMIN WADSWORTH, <HI>who for so many Years was</HI> a burning and shin∣ing Light <HI>in this Candlestick of the LORD; tho' for some Years past at the Head of the</HI> School of the Prophets <HI>among us: but has lately received a Dismission from his Post below, to receive his Reward above.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Surely Death has in this Instance clos'd the Scenes of an active, useful, valuable Life, devoted to the Honour of GOD and Benefit of his People, and worn out with long Application to Divine Studies, fervent Prayers, and im∣portant Services. For that was his</HI> proper Motto, <HI>SERVING THE LORD: and this must be the honorable

<P><HI>I might go now into a very particular Account of the many</HI> good Things which were found in him towards the Lord his God, <HI>and might venture upon a large En∣comium (even to</HI> the acknowledging of every good Thing, which was in him in Christ Jesus) <HI>with as little Hazard of giving Offence to the most enviously cap∣tious, as perhaps in any Case that has fallen within my Notice: But as it has been my known Custom of late Years (for some peculiar Reasons) industriously to decline bringing</HI> Funeral-Characters <HI>into the Pulpit, I wou'd even now avoid a too</HI> pompous <HI>Appearance, and Affectation of</HI> Embellishment, <HI>tho' I cou'd not persuade myself to be wholly silent on this</HI> uncommon <HI>Occasion; when without Controversy so much is due to the Memory of the</HI> Dead, <HI>and so much presents it self to be spoken for the Instruction of the</HI> Living, <HI>and to the Honour of that</HI> Divine Grace, by which he was what he was.</P>
<P><HI>If we shou'd here trace him back to his</HI> first <HI>Days, and look at him as a</HI> Student <HI>in the publick School, those who were his Contemporaries, bear Witness to his early Piety, singular Gravity, Probity, Modesty, and universal good Behaviour; to his exemplary Docility, his laudable In∣dustry in Academical Studies, and Proficiency in useful Literature: tho', his Favorite-Study was</HI> Divinity, <HI>the noblest Entertainment to every</HI> serious <HI>Mind, and a just</HI> Improvement <HI>in the theoretical and experimental Know∣ledge of it, certainly the best Preparative for that</HI> sacred <HI>Work, on which his</HI> Eye <HI>was fix'd, yea his</HI> Heart <HI>en∣gag'd; nor indeed without</HI> that <HI>can it be expected, any shou'd be</HI> wise to win Souls, <HI>without which happy Skill the most accomplish'd</HI> Master of Arts <HI>is like to prove but a</HI> blind Guide, <HI>an uncouth Minister, and must make a very aukward Figure both in his publick Performances, and his private Applications to Families and Persons un∣der his Charge.</HI></P>

<P><HI>For</HI> my <HI>peculiar Situation rather seems to call me to the Consideration of him in this</HI> Ministerial <HI>Capacity, while so long and nearly related to this</HI> Church <HI>and unto</HI> Me. <HI>And here I might sum up his amiable Character, in that descriptive Language of the Apostle</HI>; A beloved Brother in CHRIST, and a faithful Minister, and Fellow-Servant in the LORD, my Fellow-Worker unto the Kingdom of GOD, which hath been a Comfort unto Me, and a Helper of your Joy.</P>
<P><HI>I must confess, it was very much the superiour Affec∣tion and Reverence I bore to</HI> him, <HI>for his known general

Worth, and his Reputation for Candour and Kindness in particular, that determin'd me to accept the Call of this Church, and (contrary to my first Views and Purposes) to settle so early in the Ministry, where I might enjoy the Assistance of so pious, so prudent, so tender a Colleague, as</HI> the Guide of my Youth.—<HI>I've ever look'd on it indeed as a remarkable Instance of his Meekness and Condescen∣tion, that he so willingly conceded to the (perhaps too hasty) Desires and Attempts of his People for the fixing one so young, unfurnish'd, and unexperienc'd, a Partner with him, in the Charge of this ancient and then flourishing Congregation.— Sure I am, I've great Reason to be thankful for the Benefit of his fatherly Advices, as well as effectionate Prayers for me, and the excellent Example, in which he went before and led me, for so many of my Years in the less discreet Age of human Life: Nor was it (I trust) without some Degree of a</HI> mutual <HI>Satisfaction, that I aim'd to</HI> walk in the same Spirit, <HI>and</HI> to serve with him, as a Son with a Father, <HI>in the Work of the Gospel.—But</HI> do I begin to commend my self? <HI>I am check'd by that Divine Caution,</HI> Let another Man praise thee, and not thine own Mouth. <HI>However, this Caveat against</HI> Self-Applause <HI>evidently implies in it a Permission to give</HI> others <HI>their deserved Praise,</HI> Honour to whom Honour <HI>is due. It's difficult indeed sometimes to commend the</HI> Living <HI>without being suspected of Flattery: but one wou'd think, that in praising the</HI> Dead <HI>we shou'd be very</HI> sincere, <HI>when we have the awful Views of the</HI> Grave <HI>and</HI> Eter∣nity <HI>before us. The Apostle celebrated his living Partners, as</HI> the Glory of Christ, whose Praise is in the Gospel throughout all the Churches: <HI>and he has drawn up a numerous Catalogue of</HI> deceased <HI>Prophets and Worthies, whose Memory be consecrates to all Posterity.</HI> By a Faith which wrought Righteousness, the Elders obtained a good Report: <HI>and they are had</HI> in everlasting Remem∣brance.</P>

Moderation <HI>be known to all Men: yet he cou'd occasio∣nally be</HI> warm, <HI>when he thought the Cause wou'd bear, and Duty requir'd it.

Yet neither at any time used he</HI> flattering <HI>Words, or a</HI> Cloke <HI>of Covetousness, nor of Men sought he</HI> Glory.‐ <HI>He convers'd with much of an unaffected</HI> Composure, Simplicity <HI>and</HI> Truth: <HI>knowing how to shew Civility, without Complements; and to be affable and pleasant, without Lightness or the usual Airs of an unguarded Mind, as well as to be serious and reserv'd, without the Humours of Preciseness, or Austerity: Easy of Access, familiar in his Visits, and his</HI> Speech se∣son'd with Salt, <HI>peaceful, gracious, and such as might</HI> mini∣ster Grace and Peace to the Hearers.— <HI>He knew how to bear the severe Trial of froward Censures, and injurious Treatment, with a dispassionate Silence</HI>; not rendring Evil for Evil, or Railing for Railing, <HI>but</HI> patient, not a Braw∣ler, no Striker. <HI>Nevertheless, he was a faithful</HI> Reprover, <HI>and cou'd sometimes even</HI> rebuke sharply <HI>(where he ap∣prehended, the Fault deserv'd, and the Case demanded it) as became a Hater of Sin and Lover of Holiness, careful to</HI> keep himself pure, <HI>and</HI> not be a Partaker of other Men's Sins: <HI>But still he would temper his Admonitions

with a just mixture of compassionate Tenderness; especially if any Man that is called a</HI> Brother, <HI>were overtaken with a Fault, wou'd he</HI> restore such an one <HI>in the Spirit of</HI> Meekness, <HI>as</HI> considering himself <HI>a Man subject to</HI> like Passions <HI>with others.— Tho' ever prudent in his Oeco∣nomy and Expences,</HI> sober <HI>and</HI> temperate <HI>in all Things,</HI> not given to Wine, <HI>to Luxury and Extravagance: yet</HI> neither <HI>was he</HI> greedy of filthy Lucre, not covetous, but a Lover of Hospitality, a Lover of good Men, just, holy, blameless as the Steward of God; <HI>according to the Scripture-Character of the worthy</HI> Bishop <HI>or</HI> Elder. <HI>Having his Conversation thus without Covetousness, as he was himself</HI> content <HI>with such Things as he had, so he</HI> for∣gat <HI>not to</HI> do Good <HI>unto others; knowing that with such</HI> Sacrifices <HI>GOD is</HI> well pleased. <HI>But constantly with a religious Punctuality and Exactness laying by the</HI> Tenth <HI>of his Incomes, sacred for ever to the Uses of Charity and Benefaction, he had something of a</HI> Fund <HI>to repair to, as Cases presented: and was</HI> ready <HI>to distribute,</HI> willing <HI>to communicate; sending up very frequent</HI> Memorials before God, <HI>in giving</HI> much Alms <HI>to the</HI> People. <HI>He</HI> consi∣dered <HI>others</HI> to provoke them unto Love, and to good Works, <HI>both by Pattern and Proposal.</HI> He went about (<HI>in Imitation of his Divine Master</HI>) doing Good: <HI>his</HI> Hands <HI>and his</HI> Lips <HI>together feeding many, refreshing the Bowels of the</HI> poor <HI>Saints and causing the</HI> Widows <HI>Heart to sing. When the</HI> Ear <HI>heard him, then it blessed him: and when the</HI> Eye <HI>saw him, it gave Witness to him. He was a</HI> Father <HI>to the Needy: and how often did the</HI> Bles∣sing <HI>of them which were ready to perish, come upon him!</HI></P>

<P><HI>He study'd Usefulness in his own</HI> Family, <HI>both by his daily Instructions and Prayers, shewing a Deep Concern for the Souls of all under his Charge. And that he might be

found walking within his House with a perfect Heart, he was greatly solicitous to have the</HI> Sabbath <HI>sanctify'd in his Dwelling: and</HI> took Heed to himself, <HI>as well at home as abroad, that by an unblemish'd</HI> Example <HI>he might in∣duce others to a strict Observation of the</HI> Lord's Day.</P>
<P><HI>In the</HI> House of Prayer, <HI>he shew'd an exemplary</HI> Gravity <HI>in his whole Mein and Carriage, as one that</HI> reverenc'd God's Sanctuary: <HI>and when sitting under the Adminis∣trations of</HI> others, <HI>he was a very candid, as well as atten∣tive</HI> Hearer. <HI>GOD's Tabernacles were truly</HI> amiable <HI>to him, and hither he wou'd repair with a holy Pleasure, not to be detain'd at any time by the little Impediments which many plead in Excuse of their frequent Absence. Nor was his</HI> Closet <HI>less his Delight in its Season: But GOD alone was Witness to the</HI> Spirit <HI>and</HI> Manner <HI>of his secret Devoti∣ons.— He was one (we've Reason to think) that having chosen the LORD for</HI> his <HI>GOD, had his</HI> Fellowship with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ, and prayed alway in the holy Ghost. <HI>He</HI> feared <HI>GOD above many, and used his</HI> Name, <HI>which is Holy and Reverend, with a visible</HI> Awe <HI>upon his Mind. He shewed a great Reve∣rence to the sacred</HI> Scriptures; <HI>honoured the</HI> Works <HI>of GOD, and ador'd his wise and holy</HI> Providence. <HI>He</HI> exercised himself unto Godliness <HI>in all the various Branches of it: and was particularly remarkable for his</HI> Trust <HI>in God, his</HI> Patience <HI>under Divine Corrections, and a humble</HI> Resignation <HI>to the Will of Heaven, concerning him and his, as to all Events. He truly</HI> waited upon GOD: <HI>and</HI> waited for his SON from Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>In Sum, we beheld in him the rare Spectacle of an</HI> uni∣form <HI>Christian, the</HI> perfect Man <HI>and</HI> the upright, <HI>consistent in his Principles and Tempers, Profession and Practice. Yet none surely will understand me now to assert his</HI> ab∣solute <HI>Perfection. Even</HI> Aaron, <HI>the Saint of the Lord, was an Instance of the</HI> Law'<HI>s making Men</HI> Priests, <HI>which had</HI> Infirmity: <HI>and</HI> Peter, <HI>that mighty Apostle, was an Instance of the</HI> Gospel<HI>'s making Man</HI> Ministers, <HI>which
<PB N="57" REF="004140_0065_1003DBC7C1048368"/>
are sometimes justly to be</HI> blamed. <HI>And perhaps seldom has any one liv'd more under the humbling Sense of his na∣tive Pravity and remaining Infirmity, than the deceased Servant of Christ. However, You all knew him to be one who very conspicuously</HI> exercised himself always to have a Conscience void of Offence, <HI>both</HI> towards God and to∣wards Man: <HI>and You can't but testify with what Even∣ness, Constancy, Diligence and Patience he</HI> ran his christi∣an Race <HI>among us. The Spirit of his Mind and Tenor of his Conversation were evidently such as spake him an Or∣nament to his Profession: and not many</HI> good Men, <HI>not many</HI> Ministers, <HI>pass through the World with a more un∣sully'd Reputation.</HI> Ye knew the Man and his Commu∣nication: <HI>and I'm sure, his Memory as the</HI> devout <HI>and the</HI> just Man, <HI>the real and the improv'd Saint, is precious among You.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And as the</HI> good MINISTER of Jesus Christ, <HI>I doubt not, Many are ready to</HI> rise up and praise him. <HI>We have consider'd him as an</HI> Example to the Believer: <HI>the solemn</HI> Care <HI>of which is made one special Duty of a</HI> Teacher, <HI>and the actual</HI> Being <HI>of which is of great Con∣sequence, to invite just Regards to his Person, to facilitate some of the more difficult Parts of his private Work, as well as give his publick Preaching a peculiar Force and Weight, and to procure his whole Ministry the Advantage of a special Endearment among his People. And will You not now bear your deceased Pastor this additional Testimo∣ny, That while among You he was a</HI> faithful Steward <HI>of the Mysteries of God, feeding your Souls with the</HI> Bread of Life, <HI>and careful to give unto</HI> every one <HI>his Portion in</HI> due Season! <HI>Ever mindful of the Honour and Interest of his LORD, and ever seeking the Welfare of his Charge.</HI> I thank CHRIST JESUS our LORD (who enabled <HI>him</HI>) for that He counted <HI>him</HI> faithful, putting <HI>him</HI> into the Ministry; <HI>and for that,</HI> having obtained Help of GOD, <HI>he was</HI> continued <HI>so long</HI> your Servant for JESUS sake. <HI>In him you enjoy'd the</HI> nursing Father, <HI>the vigilant Bishop,
<PB N="58" REF="004140_0066_1003DBCEC24F56D0"/>
and the prudent Guide, a</HI> Seer in the Matters of GOD, <HI>who took You by the Hand and led You in the Paths of Righteousness and Truth, with much of the</HI> Wisdom that is from above, <HI>which is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of Mercy and of good Fruits, without Partiality and without Hypocrisy.</HI> The Watch∣man of Ephraim was with my GOD: <HI>and how did he</HI> watch for your Souls, as one that <HI>expected to</HI> give an Account!</P>
<P><HI>He well knew</HI> how he ought to behave himself <HI>in the House of GOD, which is the Church of the living GOD. In</HI> Prayer <HI>and</HI> Sacramental <HI>Administrations,</HI> the Man of God wept, <HI>while he poured out his Heart before the Lord. He approach'd the Throne of Grace with a filial Freedom, and yet with a godly Fear, as knowing he had to do with a ho∣ly, as well as a gracious, heavenly Father. His Pulpit-Prayers were usually fill'd with</HI> Adorations <HI>of the Attributes and Providence of a faithful Creator, as well as the Compassi∣ons of a merciful Redeemer: were large in the</HI> Confessions <HI>of Sin, particular in</HI> Supplications <HI>for the most needful Mercies, and often abounded with</HI> Thanksgiving. <HI>Nor was he unmindful to make</HI> Intercession; <HI>to pray for all Men, for Kings, and for all in Authority, for the Churches of the Saints at home, and for the whole Israel of God abroad. He bore the Publick much on his Heart: and never forgot the Poor and distressed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>His</HI> Sermons (<HI>however appearing to others plain and easy) cost him usually not a little Pains, as well in the composing them, as in the committing them to Memory. He did not</HI> offer to his God of that which cost him no∣thing, <HI>nor put You off with extemporal Effusions, or with hasty Productions. I have heard him, at the same time that he spake very</HI> humbly <HI>of his Performances in the Pulpit, yet say how his Brains have sweat in the Study, and how the intense Thought of his Mind, together with the diligent use of his Pen, has been a</HI> Weariness to his Flesh.</P>
<P><HI>He labour'd for the most perspicuous</HI> Method: <HI>and

search'd the Scriptures, to collect the most pertinent and affecting</HI> Texts <HI>under every Head, which were commonly numerous, and judiciously chosen. Having clear'd his</HI> Doctrine, <HI>he wou'd follow it with</HI> Inferences, <HI>usually practical; and enforce all with a closer Application to Conscience, in some moving Words of</HI> Exhortation. <HI>He made it his Custom to</HI> pen <HI>down his Discourses at large, even to the writing out the Words of every Scripture-Quotation: finish'd his Preparations</HI> in Season; <HI>and then with Care got 'em</HI> by Heart. <HI>I know not, that ever he was seen to use his Notes in the Pulpit: and being distinguish'd with the uncommon Talent of a very sure and tenacious Memory, he deliver'd his Sermons</HI> memo∣riter <HI>with much</HI> Readiness, <HI>and with a punctual</HI> Ex∣actness <HI>(as I have sometimes had Occasion to observe, up∣on the nicest Examination) according to the very</HI> Letter <HI>(not the Spirit and Scope only) of his Premeditations, as written in his</HI> Papers; <HI>which still he was wont to bring with him to the publick Exercises, to prompt his Memory, if there shou'd be Occasion. However, tho' he sat so fair a Copy, he never took any Pains to draw me to follow it in this Instance: nor cou'd I ever observe him to recom∣mend very much this</HI> Memoriter-Delivery, <HI>when I've confer'd with him upon it: but he rather judg'd the Mi∣nister's Care to</HI> impress his Sermons upon his own Heart and Conscience, <HI>by a previous Review for practical Ends and personal Uses, the</HI> wisest <HI>Care, as apprehending this to be the</HI> best Way of getting Sermons by Heart. <HI>And this he wou'd inculcate: but as for the other, he was not for laying an unreasonable Burden on any: as it is writ∣ten,</HI> All Men cannot receive this Saying, save they to whom it is given; He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.—<HI>Now as to his Manner of</HI> Expres∣sion, <HI>tho' in his</HI> young <HI>Days (as I have known him ob∣serve) he was pleasingly captivated with the Rhetorical Diction of many celebreted Writers (and in particular our famous and Rev.</HI> LEE, <HI>whose learned Labours he highly

valu'd) yet he soon grew less in Love with a florid Style, and addicted himself to the</HI> using great Plainness of Speech, <HI>as conceiving it best adjusted to the Ends of Gospel-Preach∣ing, especially in a common Audience, and "best becoming the Divinity and Riches of the Matter, which some while they think to adorn, do but adulterate it", and often raise a Cloud, instead of reflecting Light.</HI> Plainness <HI>of Phrase he certainly affected: and if at any time he might be thought to carry this Point to a Degree beyond what an</HI> itching Ear <HI>wou'd rather be pleas'd with, we were not wont to impute it to a faulty Negligence, but assign'd a better Principle, that is, an humble Zeal to accommodate his Ministry to the lowest Capacities, and feed the very</HI> Lambs <HI>of the Flock, the ignorant and young, whose Souls were equally precious to him as others, while he thought himself</HI> a Debtor both to the Wise and the Unwise <HI>alike.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As for the</HI> Subjects <HI>of his publick Discourses, they were generally</HI> the weightier Matters of the Law, <HI>or the more important</HI> Mysteries of the Gospel. <HI>He often went over the Perfections of</HI> GOD, <HI>the Offices of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>the Graces of the</HI> SPIRIT, <HI>the Duties of the</HI> Christian Life, <HI>(in particular, Closet-Devotions, Family-Religion, Sab∣bath-Sanctification, Covenant-keeping, Plain-dealing, So∣ber-mindedness,</HI> &amp;c.) <HI>and the contrary</HI> Evils, <HI>the prevail∣ing Sins of</HI> the Times, <HI>the</HI> Folly <HI>of Wickedness, and</HI> Wisdom <HI>of practical Godliness, the</HI> Vanity <HI>of this present World, the Happiness of</HI> Heaven <HI>and Misery of</HI> Hell, <HI>the Terrors of</HI> Death <HI>and</HI> Judgment <HI>to carnal</HI> Sinners, <HI>but the Joys of both to real</HI> Saints: <HI>such were the Points he dwelt much upon, and frequently touch'd on the most of 'em, with solemn</HI> Memento<HI>'s, almost in every Sermon. He fed us with the most wholesome Food, prepared with Care and Skill, tho' without much of artful Ornament; as aiming, not so much to gratify a delicate Fancy, as to nourish the hungry Soul. — As became a</HI> Watchman <HI>on the Wall, he seldom fail'd of</HI> accommodating <HI>the Tenor of his Discourses to the various</HI> Emergencies <HI>of Providence;
<PB N="61" REF="004140_0069_1003DBD3CE2FED70"/>
that he might speak</HI> Words in Season, <HI>and take the Ad∣vantage of Men's present Thoughts and Tempers, to awaken Sinners and quicken Saints to a greater Mindfulness of that GOD, who governs all Events.</HI></P>
<P><HI>He performed all his Administrations with a holy</HI> Affecti∣on: <HI>discovering the Power of Things divine and spiritual upon his own Heart, and a Thirst to inspire the like sacred Warmth into the Hearts of others. Nor did he do the Work of the LORD negligently, but may be truly said to have been</HI> abundant in Labours: <HI>serving GOD day and night with unceasing Prayer, with diligent Study, with religious Conference, and many Labours, both seen and unseen</HI>; willing to spend and be spent <HI>in the Service of his</HI> MASTER <HI>in Heaven, &amp; willing to have</HI> imparted unto Us, not the Gospel of God only, but also his own Soul, because we were dear to him.</P>
<P><HI>Though he lov'd his Closet and Books; yet</HI> loving his Neighbour as himself, <HI>and remembring those Words of our LORD,</HI> It is more blessed to give than to receive, <HI>he was much abroad, usually every Day more or less, going a</HI> religious Circuit <HI>among his People: for which Purpose he wisely</HI> redeem'd the Time <HI>at home by a dili∣gent Use of his</HI> Morning-Hours. <HI>He judg'd</HI> Visiting <HI>the Flock (sick &amp; well) every One at his own Dwelling, too important an Instance of the Pastoral Care to be unnecessa∣rily omitted, as affording peculiar Opportunities for</HI> wa∣tering the Seed <HI>sown in his public Preaching, by private dealing with Souls, and more direct Applications to Fami∣lies and Persons. He</HI> neglected not <HI>therefore</HI> the Gift that was in him: <HI>but was</HI> instant, in Season and out of Season; <HI>no Man more abounding in Pastoral Visits: they were seldom long indeed, yet seldom too without Attemps to do Good, as he had Opportunity, at least by dropping some weighty and savoury Sentence, some seasonable Coun∣sel or Reproof. And he has been much remark'd for his Impartiality, visiting all his Charge,</HI> without prefer<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g one before another; communicating the Gospel pri∣vately
<PB N="62" REF="004140_0070_1003DBD6A26FA0C8"/>
to them which were of Reputation, <HI>as well as unto others, and not overlooking any the meanest Cottages, while he pass'd along to the richer Houses. Yet He went not up and down as a</HI> Tale-bearer, <HI>or as a</HI> Busy-body <HI>in other Men's Matters, nor was he carry'd about by an</HI> Athenian <HI>Temper,</HI> spending his Time in nothing else but either hearing or telling some new Thing: <HI>But he was like the</HI> good Shepherd <HI>that is</HI> diligent to know the State of his Flocks, and looketh well to his Herds. <HI>And very observant at the same time was he of that Apostolic Ca∣non</HI>; Rebuke not an Elder, but intreat him as a Father, and the younger Men as Brethren; the elder Women as Mothers, the younger as Sisters, with all Purity.— <HI>He walked</HI> circumspectly, <HI>having no Fellowship with the unfruitful Works of Darkness, but rather reproving 'em by Word and Example. He watched in all Things, to</HI> give none Offence, <HI>that the Ministry might not be blamed: and to</HI> please all Men in all Things <HI>for their Good to Edification, as</HI> not seeking his own Profit, but the Profit of many, that they might be saved. <HI>And perhaps his private were no less useful than his public Labours: besure his Visits were of high Account among his People, and answer'd this valuable End, to enlarge your Hearts in Affection to his Person, which by a natural Efficacy con∣duced to make him unto You</HI> as a very lovely Song, <HI>and not</HI> Hatred in the House of his GOD. <HI>How often have your Souls</HI> blessed <HI>him in your secret Thoughts, and your Ears hung upon his Lips, while You heard the</HI> gra∣cious Words <HI>which proceeded out of his Mouth!</HI></P>
<P><HI>And in (what I must not neglect to mention) that im∣portant Work of</HI> Catechizing <HI>the Youth, which he took a tender</HI> Father<HI>'s Pleasure in, cannot many of You remember how upon such Occasions, while you were yet as feeble</HI> Lambs, <HI>he carry'd you often in the Arms of his Faith to the Throne of Grace for a Divine Blessing, always pray∣ing over you with a paternal Pity and Affection,</HI> that your Souls might be bound up in the Bundle of Life
<PB N="63" REF="004140_0071_1003DBDEC3111860"/>
with the LORD his GOD! <HI>At the same Time how did he feed your young Minds, according as they cou'd bear, with</HI> the sincere Milk of the Word; gentle among you, even as a Nurse cherisheth her Children!</P>
<P><HI>I may now appeal to you,</HI> Fathers, <HI>and say, in some select Passages of blessed</HI> Paul<HI>'s Farewel-Speech to the</HI> Ephesians, <HI>justly applying them to the present Case:</HI> Ye know, from the first Day that he came among You, after what Manner he has been with You <HI>at all Seasons,</HI> serving the LORD with all <HI>Humility</HI> of Mind, and with <HI>many Tears,</HI> and Temptations which befel him: and how he kept back nothing that was profitable unto You, but shewed You, and taught You Publickly, and <HI>from House to House,</HI> testifying unto you all Repentance towards GOD, and Faith towards our Lord JESUS CHRIST <HI>(which were the general Theme and constant Drift both of his publick Sermons and private Visitations)</HI> nor ceased he to warn every one night and day with Tears. <HI>And I well remember, the happy Consciousness of his own Integrity and Faithfulness enabled him, often in the Course of his Ministry, to make that solemn Address to You, in the Language of the same Apostle,</HI> I take You to Record this Day, that I am pure from the Blood of all Men: for I have not shunned to declare unto You all the Counsel of God. <HI>And such was his Firmness of Mind and Resolution in his Master's Work, that he cou'd say, still in the Apostle's Words (which too he wou'd fre∣quently bring into his Sermons</HI>) Bonds and Afflictions await me; but none of these Things move Me, neither count I my Life dear to my self, so that I might finish my Course with Joy, and the Ministry which I have receiv'd of the Lord JESUS, to testify the Gospel of the Grace of GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Nor was he without a desirable</HI> Success, <HI>and</HI> Accep∣tance <HI>in his Ministry. GOD hunoured him before us by visibly owning his Labours, and crowning them in many Instances with an effectual Blessing. Both in his Preach∣ing
<PB N="64" REF="004140_0072_1003DBE2417C3BD8"/>
and Visits how did his</HI> Doctrine drop as the Rain, <HI>without Noise, but with good Effects; his</HI> Speech distil as the Dew, <HI>prosperously, tho' silently,</HI> as the small Rain upon the tender Herb, and as the gentle Showers upon the Grafs, <HI>while</HI> he published the Name of the LORD <HI>and</HI> preached the acceptable Year of our GOD! <HI>He was truly a</HI> Barnabas <HI>among us,</HI> A good Man, and full of the holy Ghost and of Faith, and much People was added to the LORD, <HI>and we</HI> glorified GOD in him.— <HI>In the Esteem, as well as the Success he met with, GOD clothed him as with white Robes; and I doubt not, in that Day when GOD shall open his</HI> Book of Remem∣brance <HI>and</HI> bind up his Jewels, <HI>this his faithful Servant <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be dignify'd with a glorious Testimony from the Mouth of his blessed</HI> JUDGE. <HI>(Like that in</HI> Mal. 2.5, 6.)</P>
<P><HI>Verily, not he that commendeth himself, is appro∣ved, but whom the LORD commendeth: and it's the</HI> good <HI>Man that obtaineth Favour of the LORD. Nor does He seldom give to</HI> such <HI>that loving Favour from</HI> Men <HI>too, which is preferable to great Riches.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The deceased Servant of GOD was in our Eyes a real</HI> Grace <HI>to his Order and</HI> Blessing <HI>to his Generation: ac∣cordingly</HI> held in much Reputation <HI>among us, justly valu'd by his</HI> Fellow-Servants <HI>in the Gospel, and highly belov'd of his</HI> People. And others <HI>that saw him, as he went the Rounds among his Flock,</HI> to visit the Fatherless and Wi∣dows in their Affliction, <HI>yea (like another</HI> Paul <HI>or</HI> Bar∣nabas) <HI>to</HI> visit all the Brethren in every House, and see how they did, <HI>were ready to</HI> rise up and call him Blessed, <HI>and to say to one another in the Words of the</HI> Shunamite <HI>to her Husband concerning the Prophet,</HI> Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy Man of GOD, which passeth by us continually.</P>
<P><HI>It will be ask'd by some perhaps, How then came</HI> He <HI>wil∣ling to relinquish his Charge, or this</HI> Church <HI>to give up their Title to his Ministry? — I remember well</HI> my own <HI>Anxiety, and</HI> your <HI>Tears, as well as</HI> his, <HI>at our</HI> Parting <HI>(now

nigh</HI> 12 <HI>Years since) when, tho' (I'm persuaded)</HI> we were in his Heart to die and to live with us, <HI>yet a View to more extensive Service, and therein to the Glory of GOD, a Care for the</HI> School of the Prophets, <HI>and therein for</HI> all the Churches, <HI>over-rul'd to carry him from us. No other Principles, I'm satisfied, cou'd have prevail'd to overcome</HI> his <HI>Reluctance to leave his</HI> dear Flock, <HI>nor any other Considerations have brought this</HI> Church <HI>into the</HI> Vote of Resignation, <HI>concerning their</HI> beloved Pastor, <HI>which not without many Thoughts of Heart they passed on that Occasion: such was the reciprocal Endearment be∣tween us. And I believe, that all wou'd have had the Springs of Grief more sensibly awaken'd in them, I'm sure the aking Hearts of some had been almost disconsolate, if we had imagin'd it a</HI> final Farewel (<HI>as in that remarkable Case not altogether unlike ours,</HI>—Act. 20.36,—38.) <HI>For tho' we had expected to have frequent Opportunities for</HI> seeing his Face <HI>and hearing his Voice in occasional Labours among us, yet GOD was pleas'd very soon to extinguish our Hopes, by arresting him with grievous Pains and great In∣firmity, which he quickly fell into, and which much con∣fin'd him, not suffering him for these many Years to be often or long from home. However, thro' the Favour of GOD to his Servant, still he was wonderfully sustain'd under his Burden, and carry'd on in the Duty of his Sta∣tion, spirited to attend his daily Labours and Cares at the</HI> College (not regarding his Life, <HI>when cautious Friends wou'd sometimes check his Zeal, saying,</HI> Master, spare thy self) <HI>and to prosecute his Studies at Home, both with an assiduous unfainting Perseverance, till call'd off by the Presages of his</HI> End <HI>coming on; the LORD (in his Pro∣vidence) saying in him, as to</HI> Moses, Behold, thy Days approach that Thou must die! <HI>And while confin'd (for a few Weeks) to his Sick-Chamber, he still found that</HI> Grace sufficient for him, <HI>which had ever been his whole Depen∣dance in all Conditions. The</HI> LORD stood with him <HI>in his last Encounters, and</HI> strengthned him on the Bed of
<PB N="66" REF="004140_0074_1003DBE9B5AC91F0"/>
Languishing, <HI>with Strength in his Soul. As his</HI> outward Man <HI>perished, the</HI> inward Man <HI>was renewed day by day; for which Cause he fainted not: But lay calm and pati∣ent,</HI> strong in Faith <HI>and full of humble Submission</HI>; de∣siring to depart and be with CHRIST, <HI>and wishing the blessed Time might be hastned, yet still resign'd to the Will of his heavenly Father. Favour'd with living Comforts in his expiring Moments, he cou'd and did with a lively Hope commit his Soul into the Hands of his dear</HI> REDEEM∣ER, <HI>in whom he had believ'd, and whom he had preach'd and serv'd; leaving his dying Testimony for</HI> CHRIST, <HI>his Truths and Ways</HI>; trembling for the Ark of GOD, and praying for the Peace of <HI>Jerusalem</HI>; commending <HI>all about him</HI> to GOD, and to the Word of his Grace, <HI>and expressing the best Wishes in solemn manner for one and another that made their respectful Visits to him.— May</HI> I <HI>never forget the</HI> Blessing wherewith the Man of GOD blessed Me before his Death! <HI>And may the LORD GOD of</HI> Elijah, <HI>who only can</HI> command <HI>the Blessing, cause it to rest upon me, in my Service here on Earth, while the happy Spirit of my departed Father is enjoying his Re∣ward in Heaven, as his Flesh, now laid in the Dust, rests in Hope.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH WAS THE MAN, WHOM GOD HATH TAKEN!</P>
<P>I pretend not indeed to have drawn his <HI>Character</HI> at full Length, and in all its lovely Proportions, tho' I've held you long upon it, beyond my first Intention. There may have happen'd some material <HI>Defects</HI>; but I am not conscious of any faulty <HI>Excesses,</HI> nor yet of any artful <HI>Glosses,</HI> to set it in a false Light. The Reflection now is obvious, that we find, an uncommon Assemblage of very valuable useful Qualities form his amiable Character; such as speak him <HI>Great in the Sight of the LORD,</HI> and such as may well make his Name precious with all that have a just Idea of <HI>real Greatness.</HI></P>
<P>It mayn't be amiss to repeat here an Observation I've met with: "Tho' many had made a brighter and greater Figure in the Eye of the World, than <HI>John,</HI> yet CHRIST prefers <HI>him</HI> to them all; <HI>There hath not risen a GREATER than</HI> John <HI>the Bap∣tist.</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="004140_0075_1003DBED42A093B0"/>
Those are the <HI>greatest</HI> Men, that are the greatest <HI>Saints,</HI> and the greatest <HI>Blessings,</HI> under the vital Influence of the Spirit of God and of Glory.— I may therefore with a singular Propriety apply that well known Lamentation, in the present Case, <HI>Know ye not that a GREAT MAN is fallen this Day in</HI> Israel!</P>
<P>And now shall we not all mingle our Tears over the Grave of the Man of GOD, <HI>mark the perfect Man,</HI> and mourn our own and the public Loss in the Death of a Father in <HI>Israel</HI>!</P>
<P>We heartily sympathise with the bereaved <HI>Family</HI> and <HI>Rela∣tives:</HI> and pray GOD to comfort the many Mourners on this Occasion. May the GOD of all Grace and Comfort, in par∣ticular, support his Handmaid, the desolate <HI>Widow,</HI> under her heaviest Sorrow! May her MAKER still be her <HI>Husband,</HI> and remember her, the Kindness of her Youth, and Love of her Espousals, and yet more sensibly espouse her to Himself in Loving kindness, give her now the Oil of Joy for Mourn∣ing, and the Garment of Praise for the Spirit of Heaviness!</P>
<P>May the bereav'd <HI>College</HI> have this Stroke of the Divine Hand upon it sanctify'd, both to <HI>the Master and the Scholar,</HI> even to all belonging or related to it! And may the GOD of the Spirits of all Flesh chuse out an <HI>Elisha,</HI> to succeed in the pre∣sent Vacancy, on whom He will cause to rest <HI>a double Portion of the good Spirit,</HI> so visible on the <HI>Elijah</HI> taken from their Head!— May this Death be sanctify'd also to <HI>Ministers,</HI> and all of <HI>publick</HI> Character! May <HI>We,</HI> the Ministers of <HI>this</HI> Church in particular, hear GOD's Voice, speaking to us in louder Accents, and be excited to our Work, as by the Thought of <HI>Mortality</HI> and a future <HI>Account,</HI> so by wise Reflections on the <HI>Example</HI> left us by the deceased Servant of GOD!— <HI>Brethren, pray for us.</HI></P>
<P>O that this <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Congregation</HI> may have the Spirit of GOD speaking powerfully to them on this Occasion, awak∣ning a due <HI>Remembrance</HI> of the Man of God, and reviving the good <HI>Impressions</HI> of his Ministry! GOD expects, we remember and hear the Words, which He hath cried to us by his <HI>former Prophets</HI> (Zech. 7.7, 12.) and by his <HI>Apostles</HI> (Jude, <HI>ver.</HI> 17.) And that Exhortation seems to refer to the ordinary <HI>standing Ministry</HI> (Heb. 13.7.) <HI>Remember them which have spoken to you the Word of God,</HI> &amp;c.— It's observable, Our Lord (as in <HI>Matth.</HI> 11) spake honorably of <HI>John,</HI> when he had finish'd his Testimony and was fallen into some Oblivion; intending by what he said, to retrieve his declining Memory, and to restore his dying Work by reviving the People's Regard to his Preaching, which they had formerly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> zealous to hear, and which therefore they ought now to think it worth some
<PB N="68" REF="004140_0076_1003DBF05A0489A8"/>
Care to recollect.— In Conformity to this great Example, I have been <HI>stirring you up, by Putting you in Remembrance:</HI> I've done it with a View to your Profit, as well as to the Praise of the Deceased, and in both to the Glory of GOD. Let us give GOD the Honour of all the Gifts, Graces and Usefulness of his Servant; be thankful that we enjoy'd such a Blessing in his Ministry; examine our Improvements under it, and pursue the Ends of it by a lively practical Remembrance.</P>
<P>Reading his <HI>printed</HI> Works will serve to keep up his Memo∣ry, and (as it were) perpetuate his Ministry among us. I com∣mend to you in particular his valuable familiar <HI>Explanation of the Assembly's Catechism,</HI> his labour'd Treatise on <HI>Conscience,</HI> and his judicious <HI>Guide to the Doubting.</HI> That was the Text which animated him in his many Publications, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.12, 15.</P>
<P>We shall do well to <HI>stir up</HI> one another <HI>by way of Remem∣brance.</HI>— We shall do well to review him as in the <HI>Pulpit</HI> and in his <HI>Visits,</HI> and recollect in particular (as we are able) any remarkable Instructions, Advices, or Reproofs, we receiv'd from him: and let us be careful to maintain a <HI>good Remem∣brance of him always, even as it is meet, being mindful of his Tears, and following his Faith.</HI> I trust, there are some among You, that were his <HI>Hope</HI> on Earth, and will be his <HI>Joy and Crown</HI> in Heaven: let such still live the Credit of his Ministry by a holy Perseverance. But may we not fear, there are others, <HI>whom the Word preached</HI> by him <HI>did not profit?</HI> Yea, are not some of You conscious, You were a Grief to <HI>his righteous Soul?</HI> Let such tremble it the awful Prospect of his standing a <HI>Witness</HI> against you in the Day of Judgment. <HI>And</HI> (as it is written, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.33.) <HI>when it cometh to pass (lo, it will come) then shall ye know that a PROPHET hath been among you.</HI> O fear, left you be put to <HI>mourn at the last,</HI> when there's no Remedy.</P>
<P>Let us all hear GOD speaking to us in those Calls of his <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Word</HI> (2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 20.20.) <HI>Believe in the LORD your GOD, believe his Prophets.</HI> And (Jam. 5.10.) <HI>Take the Prophets, which have spoken in the Name of the Lord, for an Ex∣ample.</HI>— Let us suppose the <HI>Man of God</HI> himself addressing us (as in <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.9.) <HI>Those Things which ye have both learned and received, and heard and seen in ME, do; and the GOD of Peace shall be with You.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, Let us all now (as they, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7.2.) <HI>lament after the LORD</HI>; and with <HI>Elisah,</HI> inquire for the GOD of <HI>Elijah</HI>: making it our great Concern to secure the gracious Presence of the <HI>ever-living GOD</HI> with us, which was the Sum of our departed Friend and Father's <HI>dying Wishes</HI> for us. Let our Inquiry be <HI>frequent</HI> and <HI>persevering, fervent, penitent</HI> and <HI>believing, sincere</HI> and <HI>practical.</HI> A just Respect to the Memo∣ry
<PB N="69" REF="004140_0077_1003DBF798BE1B40"/>
of the Deceased, the Honour of God, and the Interest of Religion, our own Safety and Happiness, are Considerations that unite to persuade us into such an Inquiry. This is one genuine Fruit of the Divine Nature in us, and a hopeful Sign of the Divine Presence with us; and it bodes well to us for the coming World. If we have <HI>Elijah</HI>'s Grace, we shall attain his Glory too. Faith, Love, Hope and Desire intense are as <HI>the fiery Chariot and Horses</HI> to mount us up into <HI>heavenly</HI> Places <HI>now:</HI> and <HI>Angels</HI> will conduct us thither when we <HI>die,</HI> gathering our Souls to the Assembly of glorify'd Spirits in <HI>Paradise</HI>: and in the <HI>Resurrection-Day</HI> we shall see one ano∣ther's <HI>Faces</HI> with Joy. GOD will raise the dead Bodies of the Saints, and <HI>shew them alive</HI> to us, as He did <HI>Elijah</HI> with <HI>Moses</HI> to the Disciples in the Mount of Transfiguration: but with this happy Circumstance of Difference, that <HI>ours</HI> will be a <HI>final</HI> Meeting, and in <HI>greater Glory</HI>; for we shall dwell to∣gether in the blissful <HI>Presence</HI> of GOD through the Ages of <HI>eternal</HI> Futurity.
