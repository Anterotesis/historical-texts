<HEAD>Prayer to God for help a seasonable duty, when the Godly man ceaseth, and the faithful fail from among the children of men.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Psalm. XII. 1.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Help Lord! for the Godly man ceaseth; for the Faithful fail from among the children of men.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THEY are the words of holy <HI>David.</HI> The occasion of his penning them is not certain: But 'tis probable, 'twas now a <HI>dying time</HI> among the <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Faithful;</HI> or a <HI>time of growing degeneracy</HI> among all sorts and orders of men: upon either of which accounts, 'twas a <HI>proper Season</HI> to cry to almighty God for <HI>help.</HI> And this the <HI>Psalmist</HI> accordingly does in the language of my text, <HI>Help Lord! for the Godly man ceaseth; for the Faithful fail from among the children of Men:</HI> In speaking to which words, I shall,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Open to you the character of the <HI>Godly man</HI> and the <HI>Faithful man,</HI> the persons here particularly men∣tion'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Explain the sense in which these persons may be said to <HI>cease and fail from among the children of men.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Show what reason there is <HI>to cry to God for help,</HI> when this is the case.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The whole will then be followed with some <HI>suitable application.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004129_0004_1003D15F51302D50"/>
I. I am, in the <HI>first place,</HI> to open to you the character of the <HI>Godly man</HI> and the <HI>Faithful man,</HI> the persons mention'd in the text.</P>
<P N="1">1. And <HI>first,</HI> I shall speak of the <HI>Godly man;</HI> the <HI>foundation-stroke</HI> in whose character is, his <HI>faith in God</HI> as a being infinitely great and glorious; the creator and governour of the World, the saviour and rewarder of them that diligently seek him: according to that of the <HI>apostle,</HI> Heb. 11. 6. <HI>Without faith it is impossible to please</HI> God: <HI>For he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is his faith, in the being and attributes and do∣minion of God, a <HI>meer speculative notion;</HI> but an <HI>active living principle,</HI> suitably exciting and moving the seve∣ral <HI>passions</HI> and <HI>affections</HI> of his mind.</P>
<P>He so believes the <HI>majesty</HI> and <HI>power</HI> of God, as to be fill'd with an habitual <HI>awe</HI> and <HI>reverence</HI> of him; dread∣ing his displeasure, being much more afraid to offend him than any <HI>other Being</HI> whatsoever; in conformity to that caution of our <HI>Saviour,</HI> Luk. 12. 4, 5. <HI>Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you, whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which, after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, fear him.</HI></P>
<P>He so believes the <HI>faithfulness</HI> and <HI>veracity</HI> of God, as to rely on <HI>his word,</HI> confide in the <HI>truth</HI> and depend on the <HI>fulfilment of his promises:</HI> And however little appearance, humanely speaking, there may be at pre∣sent, of their accomplishment, <HI>he staggers not at the promise of God through unbelief; but is strong in faith, giving glory to God: being persuaded, that what he hath promised, he is able also to perform.</HI></P>
<P>He so believes in God as a being infinitely <HI>amiable, beautiful</HI> and <HI>desirable,</HI> as to <HI>love him with all his heart, and soul, and mind, and strength;</HI> esteeming his <HI>favor as life,</HI> and his <HI>loving-kindness better than life.</HI> None <HI>in
<PB N="3" REF="004129_0005_1003B5029DCB1728"/>
heaven,</HI> in his account, is <HI>like unto God,</HI> nor does he <HI>desire any on earth besides him:</HI> And his chief concern is, that God would be his friend, his God and <HI>portion forever.</HI></P>
<P>He so believes the <HI>paternal care, kindness</HI> and <HI>goodness</HI> of God, as to place his intire <HI>hope</HI> and <HI>confidence</HI> in him; <HI>trusting in the Lord at all times:</HI> Especially, making God <HI>his refuge</HI> in the <HI>day of his distress;</HI> relying on him for all that help and salvation, which is <HI>in vain to be looked for from the hills, and the multitude of mountains,</HI> and is to be had only in God, the <HI>saviour of his people in the time of trouble.</HI> Yea, he is so firmly persuaded of the <HI>love</HI> and <HI>pity</HI> of God towards <HI>them that fear him,</HI> that he <HI>casts his whole care upon him; taking no thought,</HI> no inordinate thought, <HI>for his life, what he shall eat, or what he shall drink, or wherewithal he shall be cloathed:</HI> as knowing, that God <HI>feedeth the fowls of the air, and cloatheth the lilies of the field,</HI> and <HI>will much more feed and cloath</HI> his own children, who are <HI>much better than they.</HI></P>
<P>He so believes the <HI>supreme authority,</HI> and <HI>sovereign universal dominion of God,</HI> as to <HI>acquiesce</HI> in all his deal∣ings; not daring to dispute his pleasure, or resist his will, or find fault with or murmur against his providen∣tial dispensations. That's the habitual inward sense and temper of his mind, <HI>It is the Lord, let him do what seemeth him good.</HI> He is willing, at the call of God, to part with any thing, his reputation, his interest, his friends; yea, he <HI>counts not his life dear</HI> so he may but honour God, and <HI>finish his course with joy.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, he so believes in God as <HI>sending his only be∣gotten son</HI> into the world, <HI>not to condemn the world, but that the world thro' him might be saved,</HI> that he hopes for salvation in <HI>none</HI> but <HI>in Christ:</HI> and <HI>thro' him,</HI> and the <HI>merits of his mediatorial undertaking</HI> for sinners, he trusts in the mercy of God to eternal life.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004129_0006_1003D17F05667240"/>
But this is not all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Godly man's faith in God</HI> has a powerful influ∣ence on his <HI>life</HI> as well as <HI>heart.</HI> It not only excites an <HI>internal regard</HI> towards God in the <HI>affections of his mind,</HI> but a due care to express this regard in all proper acts of outward <HI>reverence</HI> and <HI>obedience.</HI></P>
<P>The blessed God is the <HI>constant object</HI> of his <HI>external homage and worship.</HI> He is a man of prayer; delights in the duty, and is frequent in the practice of it. He is one that <HI>prays without ceasing;</HI> is habitually in a <HI>praying frame,</HI> and improves every proper season of <HI>making known his requests to God by prayer, with suppli∣cation and thanksgiving.</HI> He daily retires from the world, and <HI>enters into his closet,</HI> and <HI>prays to his father who is in secret,</HI> and hears in secret in order to his <HI>re∣warding openly.</HI> And as becomes a man of Godliness, he <HI>every day</HI> takes care, that the <HI>morning and evening sacrifice</HI> ascends up to God from his <HI>family,</HI> as the <HI>per∣petual burnt-offering:</HI> Nor is he content with these more <HI>private</HI> duties of devotion: but is constant at the <HI>house of God,</HI> serious and reverent in his attendance on the exercises of <HI>publick worship,</HI> both <HI>in season and out of season.</HI></P>
<P>And very particular is the regard which he pays to the <HI>Lord's sabbath.</HI> 'Tis his great concern and care to sanctifie this <HI>day of God;</HI> not allowing himself to <HI>do his own ways, or find his own pleasure, or speak his own words.</HI> He religiously seperates himself from the world, rests from all its labours and employments, and spends the time in the service of God, and to the purposes of piety and devotion.</P>
<P>And he pays a great regard to the <HI>word</HI> as well as <HI>sabbath</HI> of God; consulting it upon all occasions, as the <HI>man of his counsel,</HI> his main guide in the way of duty. The <HI>scripture</HI> he receives as <HI>given by inspiration of God:</HI> And because 'tis <HI>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for instruction in righteousness,</HI> he repairs to it as a suitable
<PB N="5" REF="004129_0007_1003D1930E37B1B8"/>
means in order to his becoming <HI>perfect</HI> as a <HI>man of God,</HI> and <HI>throughly furnished unto all good works.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, the <HI>Godly man</HI> is one that expresses a due regard to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>every thing that bears relation to him,</HI> thro' the general tenour of his actions. He is one in∣tirely devoted to God; and 'tis his desire and care, that his whole external conduct may express the highest ve∣neration of him. He would not willingly do any thing offensive to God, but every thing pleasing in his sight. He aims at the glory of God; and what gives the finishing stroke in his character, constantly endea∣vours to be as <HI>like him</HI> as possible. He continually sets God before him as his <HI>pattern and exemplar,</HI> and is <HI>an imitator of him as a dear child.</HI> He has no higher ambition than to <HI>resemble God,</HI> and 'tis his daily care to appear in the world, in some proportion, a <HI>living image of him;</HI> being <HI>holy as he is holy, and perfect as his father in heaven is perfect.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. But I must now go on in the <HI>second</HI> place, to speak of the <HI>Faithful man.</HI> The text makes mention not only of the <HI>Godly man,</HI> but the <HI>Faithful man.</HI> And the <HI>character</HI> is capable of being understood in a <HI>variety</HI> of senses, according to the <HI>various use</HI> of the word <HI>Faithful▪</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes, it relates to our <HI>words,</HI> and means the same thing with <HI>speaking the truth.</HI> Hence that of Prov. 14. 5. <HI>A faithful witness will not lie.</HI> And in this sense of the word, the <HI>faithful man</HI> is a man of <HI>truth and veracity;</HI> one who makes conscience of his <HI>words</HI> as well as <HI>actions.</HI> Lying and deceit are <HI>abomination</HI> to him, as they are to the <HI>holy God.</HI> He knows not how to utter a falshood, nor dare he do it, nor will he ever knowingly break in upon the law of truth. He is one whose word may be rely'd on. There is an agree∣ment between his <HI>heart</HI> and <HI>tongue.</HI> He believes what he says, and when ever he speaks, 'tis under the <HI>habitual
<PB N="6" REF="004129_0008_1003D1A20F599C78"/>
influence</HI> of those <HI>apostolic</HI> injunctions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. 3. 9.</NOTE>, <HI>Lie not one to another, seeing ye have put off the old man with his deeds.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph. 4. 25.</NOTE> <HI>Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of ano∣ther.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes again, the word <HI>faithful</HI> relates to our <HI>promises,</HI> and intends <HI>faithfulness in performing them.</HI> Thus 'tis used, 1 Thes. 5. 24. <HI>Faithful is he who calleth you, who also will do it.</HI> And in this sense, the <HI>faithful man</HI> is one who will <HI>stand to his word,</HI> be punctual in a compliance with his engagements. He is not one of those who make promises to serve a <HI>present turn,</HI> with∣out any intention to perform them: But when ever he passes his word, he <HI>speaks the truth in his heart,</HI> honestly designs to do what he says; looking upon his word as sacred, and himself as solemnly bound by it: Nor will he fail if possible, of an exact compliance with it. Yea, so punctual is he to his word, so exact to his engage∣ments, that he'll be faithful to comply, tho' it be to his real damage. As the <HI>Psalmist</HI> has drawn his charac∣ter<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psal. 15. 4.</NOTE>, <HI>tho' he sweareth to his own hurt, he changeth not.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes again, the word <HI>faithful</HI> relates to a <HI>trust committed to us,</HI> and means the same thing with <HI>fidelity in the discharge of it.</HI> And this is the most <HI>proper</HI> as well as <HI>common</HI> sense, in which it is used in <HI>scripture.</HI> In this sense of the <HI>word,</HI> we read of <HI>Moses</HI> in that lan∣guage, Numb. 12. 7. <HI>My servant Moses,—who is faithful in all my house.</HI> So of <HI>David,</HI> 1 Sam. 22. 14. <HI>Who is so faithful among all thy servants as David.</HI> So of <HI>Daniel,</HI> Dan. 6. 4. <HI>Forasmuch as he was faithful; neither was there any error or fault found in him.</HI> And in this sense of the <HI>word,</HI> the <HI>faithful man</HI> is one who uses <HI>fidelity in the trust reposed to him.</HI> Whatever the betrustment be that is committed to him, whether it relates to the <HI>souls</HI> or <HI>bodies</HI> of men, their <HI>temporal</HI> or
<PB N="7" REF="004129_0009_1003D1A738D22098"/>
<HI>spiritual</HI> concerns, he'll endeavour to be answerable to it, by a consciencious care to discharge the duties ex∣pected and required of him. He won't betray his trust, nor shrink from under the burdens of it; neither will he let it suffer thro' neglect, or a carless, slothful, in∣active management of it: but will be tho'row and effectual in doing the duties belonging to it. He looks upon his trust as committed to him by God. He realises the eye of God upon him; and upon the prin∣ciples of religion, a regard to God and the good of men, behaves with care and prudence, and diligence. He expects to be called to an account at the great day of reckoning, how he has manag'd his trust, and therefore applies himself to the proper duties of it, with the greatest care; being active and laborious in doing what he has been call'd to in the providence of God: And he is solicitous to do what he does in the <HI>best manner,</HI> so as shall <HI>best</HI> answer the end of his betrustment, and so as that he may finally come off with the testimony of a good conscience, the approbation of men; and what is of infinitely more worth, the approbation of his <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Judge,</HI> saying unto him, in the great day of his appearing, <HI>Well done, thou good and faithful ser∣vant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, the word <HI>faithful</HI> is sometimes taken in a large and extended sense, so as to mean the same thing with <HI>fidelity in the whole work of religion.</HI> Thus 'tis used, Rev. 2. 10. <HI>Be thou faithful to death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</HI> And this is one thing, perhaps the chief thing intended, when we read, in the <HI>epistles</HI> of <HI>Paul,</HI> of this and the other fellow Chris∣tian, in that stile, <HI>a faithful servant of Jesus Christ.</HI> And in this sense of the word, the <HI>faithful man</HI> is one, who employs himself with <HI>fidelity in the great business of religion.</HI> He does not content himself with vain
<PB N="8" REF="004129_0010_1003D1B05B6E7218"/>
wishes and faint ineffectual endeavours; but is active and stirring in the <HI>work of God</HI> and <HI>his soul's salvation.</HI> His concern is, to fill up his time with work and labour; <HI>doing with his might whatsoever his hand findeth to do:</HI> considering there is <HI>no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, whither he goeth.</HI> He considers the <HI>several relations</HI> he sustains in the world, and is sollicitous to do <HI>the duties of them.</HI> He considers the <HI>various talents</HI> committed to him by his great Lord, and uses his <HI>best skill</HI> to improve them to the <HI>best advantage.</HI> He considers the particular <HI>state and condition of life</HI> it has pleased God to place him in, and is careful to behave in it to the <HI>honour of God</HI> and his <HI>own final good account.</HI> In a word, his great aim is, <HI>to serve God and his generation according to the will of God;</HI> and this is the chief care, the main endeavour of his life.</P>
<P>And thus you have seen the variety of senses, in which a man may be characteris'd as a <HI>faithful man.</HI> The <HI>particular sense,</HI> in which the <HI>description</HI> is to be understood in the <HI>text,</HI> is not certain: nor is it material. For in <HI>either sense,</HI> the <HI>character</HI> is <HI>beautiful</HI> and <HI>lovely;</HI> and affords just ground for lamentation, when persons so excellent and desirable <HI>cease from among men.</HI> And this brings me,</P>
<P>II. In the <HI>second place,</HI> to explain the sense, in which the <HI>Godly and faithful</HI> are said, in the <HI>text,</HI> to <HI>cease and fail from among the children of men.</HI> And there are two senses, in which the words may be explain'd.</P>
<P N="1">1. They may be understood of <HI>the death</HI> of the faith∣ful and Godly. And the death of this kind of persons is a common case. The <HI>Godly</HI> are equally expos'd to death with the <HI>ungodly,</HI> and will as surely fall by the stroke of it, sooner or later. There is <HI>no discharge in this war</HI> for <HI>saints</HI> any more than <HI>sinners. Holiness</HI> it self will not secure from the <HI>first,</HI> however it will de∣liver
<PB N="9" REF="004129_0011_1003D1B958DFC858"/>
from the <HI>second death.</HI> Says the <HI>Apostle,</HI> Heb. 9. 27. <HI>It's appointed for all men once to die.</HI> Agre∣able whereto is that of the inspir'd <HI>Psalmist,</HI> Psalm 89. 48. <HI>What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?</HI> The sense is, there is no man, let him be who he will, or his moral character what it will, but he shall <HI>as surely die as he is now alive.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Godly</HI> have always been subjected to death in common with others. We read of <HI>Noah, Abraham, Moses,</HI> and a long list of <HI>celebrated saints,</HI> in that lan∣guage, <HI>These all died in faith.</HI> 'Tis through <HI>the dark valley of the shadow of death,</HI> that the saints have all along, through the several successive ages of the world, passed into the heavenly state; and they must pass the <HI>same way</HI> still, in order to their arriving at the <HI>same blessed place.</HI></P>
<P>And now, this <HI>removal of the Godly and faithful by death,</HI> is what the holy <HI>Psalmist</HI> might have particularly in his view, when he speaks in the <HI>text,</HI> of their <HI>ceas∣ing and failing from among the children of men.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis observable, <HI>Ahimelech,</HI> a <HI>Godly faithful man,</HI> and together with him, no less than <HI>fourscore and five Priests of the Lord,</HI> were slain upon the spot, by the command of <HI>Saul,</HI> in the days of <HI>David</HI> and upon <HI>his account;</HI> as we may read, in the 22d. <HI>Chapter</HI> of the <HI>first book</HI> of <HI>Samuel.</HI> It might possibly be upon <HI>this,</HI> or some such sad and remarkable <HI>ceasing and failing of the Godly and faithful by death,</HI> that <HI>David</HI> uttered these words: or, he might cry out in the language of the <HI>text,</HI> upon the news of the decease of some pious and faithful friend. 'Tis thought, that <HI>Samuel,</HI> the <HI>Lord's prophet,</HI> a <HI>Godly man,</HI> and one of <HI>David'</HI>s best and most <HI>faithful friends,</HI> died about the time of the composure of this <HI>Psalm:</HI> Upon which, says one, <Q>When I read, 1 Sam. 25. 1. <HI>That Samuel died, and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house in Ramah;</HI> methinks I hear <HI>David</HI> among the
<PB N="10" REF="004129_0012_1003D1C08690F438"/>
<HI>mourners,</HI> crying out with the greatest sorrow and concern, <HI>Help Lord, for the Godly man ceaseth, for the faithful fail from among the children of men.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And 'tis with great justness and propriety, the <HI>Godly and faithful</HI> may be said to <HI>cease and fail from among the children of men,</HI> when they are <HI>taken away by death.</HI> For an <HI>end</HI> is now, at once, put to their <HI>being</HI> on the earth; and we may say of them in the language of holy <HI>Job</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job 7. 8.</NOTE>, <HI>The eye of him that hath seen them, shall see them no more.</HI> For they are <HI>gone,</HI> as he elsewhere observes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">—10. 21.</NOTE>, <HI>whence they shall not return, even to the land of darkness, and the shadow of death.</HI> Agreable whereto is that elegant description he has given us of death<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">7. 9. 10.</NOTE>, <HI>As the clod is consumed and vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The words may be understood of the <HI>ceasing of the Godly and faithful, thro' the growing corruption and degeneracy of the times.</HI> And this is the sense, in which the words are most commonly explain'd. Says a <HI>learned Annotator</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Bp. Patrick in Loc.</NOTE>. <Q>This <HI>Psalm</HI> was compos'd in a very <HI>cor∣rupt age,</HI> in which it was hard to find an <HI>honest plain-dealing man,</HI> in whom one might confide.</Q> To be sure, we often find this <HI>holy man of God</HI> lamenting the <HI>badness of the times,</HI> complaining of the increase of wickedness, a universal degeneracy. Says he, in the <HI>verse</HI> following the <HI>text, They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and a double tongue do they speak.</HI> And he makes that sad remark, Psalm 14. 2, 3. <HI>The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand and seek God. They are all gone aside, they are altogether become filthy, there is none that doth good, not one.</HI> And some suppose, that this might probably be the state of things, when <HI>David</HI> penned the <HI>text.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="004129_0013_1003D1C6E2993938"/>
There was so little an appearance of real virtue and goodness, and so great an appearance of vice and wick∣edness, among all sorts of persons, that he trembled at the sad prospect, and could not refrain from <HI>applying to God for help.</HI> <Q>We may charitably and reasonably hope, says a celebrated writer▪ there were many serious and upright men in the land; as there were <HI>seven thousand</HI> in the days of <HI>Elijah,</HI> who maintain'd their integrity, when he thought there had been none besides himself: But it seems they were so private and concealed, so much out of <HI>David</HI>'s view and ob∣servation,</Q> that he feared they were <HI>ceas'd from among the children of men:</HI> at least, the defection was so general, that he thought he had just reason to take up his lamentation, and <HI>go to God for help.</HI></P>
<P>And it must be acknowledged, there is not a more awful token of the displeasure of almighty God, than the <HI>general ceasing of Godly and faithful men.</HI> When men of known piety and fidelity fail from among a people, by being <HI>call'd out</HI> of the world; or when they cease by means of the <HI>growing degeneracy of the times,</HI> 'tis a sad symptom, and bodes ill to a people: Nor is there a <HI>more proper season,</HI> nor can there be <HI>greater reason,</HI> to <HI>cry after God</HI> in the language of the <HI>text.</HI> And this leads to the third thing propos'd, which was,</P>
<P>III. To show what reason there is to <HI>cry to God for help,</HI> when the <HI>Godly and faithful fail from among men.</HI> And there is good reason for this upon the following accounts.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>There is just ground of fear, what God may be about to do against a people, when the Godly and faithful cease from among them:</HI> And this, whether they cease by <HI>death,</HI> or the <HI>growing degeneracy of the age.</HI></P>
<P>If they cease by <HI>reason of Death,</HI> 'tis a <HI>sad presage of evil a coming.</HI> For <HI>Godly faithful men</HI> are the <HI>defence</HI> and <HI>safety</HI> of the places where they live. So good

<HI>Josiah</HI> was the protection of <HI>Israel.</HI> While he was alive, God would not bring <HI>deserved evil</HI> upon them▪ but as soon as he was <HI>gathered to his fathers,</HI> the <HI>threat∣ned calamities brake in upon them.</HI> And 'tis often the method of providence, to remove good men by death, to make way for the execution of his judgments. 'Tis observable, the first thing we read of, after the <HI>death</HI> and <HI>burial</HI> of <HI>Elisha,</HI> that <HI>holy man of God,</HI> is, that <HI>the Moabites invaded the land</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings, 13. 20.</NOTE>. And 'tis particularly re∣mark't of the <HI>righteous,</HI> that <HI>they are taken away from the evil to come</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah 57. 1.</NOTE>. As one expresses it, "There is great cause of fear, when God <HI>houses his dear and faithful servants,</HI> lest some <HI>heavy storm of Judgment should be ready to break upon them.</HI></P>
<P>Or, if the <HI>Godly and faithful cease by means of grow∣ing wickedness,</HI> there is the same, or rather, greater reason for fear, what may be the event. There is no <HI>worse symptom</HI> upon a people than that of <HI>increasing degeneracy.</HI> When <HI>Godliness fails</HI> thro' the prevalency of <HI>profaneness and impiety;</HI> when real vertue and good∣ness ceases, thro' and overballance of vice and wick∣edness, 'tis a <HI>sad prognostic of impending judgment.</HI> For it has always been the method of heaven, to testify against the <HI>degeneracy of a people;</HI> especially has this been the method of providence, when the <HI>defection is great;</HI> God is generally neglected, his ordinances de∣spised and ways forsaken.</P>
<P>The <HI>ceasing of Godly and faithful men</HI> is therefore a matter that administers <HI>just ground of fear,</HI> lest the effect should be something <HI>sad and sorrowful</HI> in the course of divine providence. We may, in this case, well <HI>tremble for fear of God, and be afraid of his judg∣ments.</HI> And if ever, there is <HI>now reason to seek the Lord,</HI> and cry earnestly to him <HI>for help;</HI> especially, if we go on, and consider in the second place,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="13" REF="004129_0015_1003D1E96EC13530"/>
2. That <HI>help may be obtained from God, and can be had from none else.</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>Godly and faithful cease by means of death,</HI> he can raise up and qualify others to stand in their place and make their ground good. The <HI>residue of the spirit</HI> is with him: and he can cause the <HI>spirit of Elijah to rest on Elisha.</HI> As he takes Godly useful men out of the world by <HI>death,</HI> he can raise up others, and form within them like principles of universal goodness. He can make them men of like piety and integrity, of like truth and fidelity, of like zeal for the divine ho∣nour, and of like extensive serviceableness in their day and generation. And <HI>God only</HI> can do this. In vain is it to look for help, in this matter, from any but <HI>him.</HI> He only forms the spirit of man within him, and he only can form men for his own glory.</P>
<P>Or, if the <HI>Godly and faithful cease by the prevailing badness of the times,</HI> in this case also, <HI>God only can afford help.</HI> When a people are become generally corrupt and wicked, the powerful interposition of God, and this only, will be <HI>effectual,</HI> to restrain them from vice, and bring them back to the practice of religion and virtue. They may possibly think there is little need of the <HI>Divine help,</HI> and be apt to leave God out of all their thoughts. But if ever they are reformed, and recovered to their duty, it must be by means of <HI>help obtained from God.</HI> Says the <HI>Prophet,</HI> bespeaking the <HI>Jewish Nation</HI> in the name of God, <HI>O Israel, thou hast destroyed thy self; but in me is thy help</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hos. 13. 9.</NOTE>. And <HI>Ephraim,</HI> by whom we are to understand the <HI>Kingdom of Israel,</HI> the <HI>ten tribes;</HI> I say, <HI>Ephraim</HI> is represented as being made sensible, that <HI>his help was only in God;</HI> and is therefore brought in, applying to God in that serious and pertinent language, <HI>Turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah 31. 16.</NOTE>. If it shall
<PB N="14" REF="004129_0016_1003D1DEA0BABD08"/>
please <HI>God,</HI> by the <HI>powerful influence</HI> of his grace and spirit, to <HI>turn a degenerate people</HI> from their vices and follies, they will then be <HI>effectually turned;</HI> and <HI>not else.</HI> It can be done by <HI>no other power,</HI> by <HI>no other means,</HI> in <HI>no other way.</HI> Says the <HI>prophet,</HI> affording <HI>direction</HI> to a sinful people, in their <HI>return to the Lord their God, Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously,</HI> Hosea 14. 2.</P>
<P>Now, as <HI>help may be had from God,</HI> and can be had <HI>from none else,</HI> this is a <HI>good reason,</HI> why we shou'd ap∣ply to him for it: Especially if it be added in the next place,</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>he expects to be sought to for help.</HI> And this is <HI>very particularly</HI> his expectation from a <HI>sinful and degenerate people:</HI> Nor without suitably applying to God, may they hope to receive <HI>that help,</HI> without which they must <HI>perish in their iniquities.</HI> 'Tis remarkable, when God had promised his people of old, to <HI>cleanse them from their filthiness,</HI> to <HI>give them a new heart,</HI> and <HI>put his spirit within them,</HI> to make them a <HI>Godly faith∣ful people,</HI> he adds upon it, in that express and peremp∣tory language, <HI>I will yet for this be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. 36. 37.</NOTE>. And when God in∣tends mercy to a people <HI>fallen by their iniquities,</HI> he does not <HI>ordinarily</HI> bestow it, till they are <HI>brought upon their Knees,</HI> and earnestly <HI>pray for it.</HI> Says God to his people <HI>Israel,</HI> Jer. 29. 11. <HI>I know the thoughts that I think towards you, thoughts of peace and not of evil.</HI> It follows in the next words, <HI>Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me and find me, when ye shall search for me with all thine heart.</HI></P>
<P>Upon these and such like grounds, we should be <HI>crying to God for help,</HI> when the <HI>Godly and faithful
<PB N="15" REF="004129_0017_1003D1EF9207B130"/>
cease from among us.</HI> We should go to him in a way of <HI>prayer,</HI> committing the case to him, as to our mer∣ciful father, who is <HI>able</HI> and <HI>ready</HI> to do for us even beyond all that we can either ask or think.</P>
<P>Only, when we <HI>seek to God for help,</HI> let us remember to do it in the <HI>Name of Christ;</HI> according to our Sa∣viour's own <HI>direction</HI> as well as <HI>encouragement,</HI> John 14. 13, 14. <HI>Whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do; that the father may be glorified in the son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</HI> Par∣rallel whereto are those words in the 16th <HI>Chapter</HI> the 23d and 24th <HI>verses, Verily, verily, I say unto you, what∣soever ye shall ask the father in my name, he will give it you. Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name: Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.</HI></P>
<P>And our <HI>prayer for help</HI> should be put up likewise, with a becoming <HI>seriousness, reverence</HI> and <HI>subjection of soul;</HI> not pretending to prescribe to God the <HI>time,</HI> or <HI>manner</HI> or <HI>method</HI> of helping us; but leaving it with his own infinite wisdom and goodness, to manage the matter as he knows to be best.</P>
<P>The <HI>Application</HI> now remains.</P>
<P>And it shall be in one word, turning the discourse into a <HI>serious exhortation;</HI> beseeching us to apply our selves to God, in the language of holy <HI>David</HI> in the text, <HI>Help Lord! for the Godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.</HI></P>
<P>And considering our present circumstances, perhaps there is as much reason for the prayer <HI>now,</HI> as there was in the days of <HI>David.</HI> How many holy good men, men of eminent piety and fidelity, both in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State,</HI> have been remov'd out of the <HI>land</HI> by <HI>death,</HI> within the compass of a few years!</P>
<P>What a <HI>ceasing</HI> has there been among our <HI>Godly faith∣ful magistrates?</HI> How many have been taken away of <HI>late years,</HI> who were Zealous for the honour of God, and
<PB N="16" REF="004129_0018_1003B5281CE86BD0"/>
sought the welfare of their people; men of known integrity and impartial distribution of justice, <HI>the mi∣nisters of God for good; not terrors to good works, but the evil.</HI></P>
<P>And if we look into the <HI>Sepulcres of the prophets,</HI> how many shall we find there, who, not many years since, shone among us as <HI>Stars of the first magnitude;</HI> men eminently pious and laborious, wise and prudent, faith∣ful and useful, and greatly renown'd for the <HI>gifts of grace,</HI> as well as their <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>acquired accomplish∣ments.</HI></P>
<P>And in <HI>private life</HI> likewise, how many have fail'd from among us by reason of <HI>death?</HI> Men devout to∣wards God; men of conscience and religion; men of faith and prayer, <HI>sound in God's statutes,</HI> and of an ex∣emplary good <HI>conversation in Christ.</HI></P>
<P>But what is still more lamentable, what a fearful <HI>ceasing</HI> has there been of the <HI>Godly and Faithful,</HI> thro' the <HI>growing degeneracy</HI> of <HI>all sorts</HI> of persons among us? How general has been our revolt from God, our de∣fection for real and substantial goodness?</P>
<P>The blessed God might bespeak us, with relation to our <HI>original</HI> or <HI>first existence as a people,</HI> in the language of Jer. 2. 2, 3. <HI>I remember thee the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown. Israel was holiness to the Lord, and the first fruits of his increase.</HI> But might he not expostulate with us, as in the two fol∣lowing verses, <HI>Hear ye the word of the Lord, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord, what iniquity have ye found in me, that ye are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</HI> It may, with great propriety, be said of <HI>New-England</HI> as in Judges 2. 7. <HI>And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that out lived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the Lord, that he did for Israel.</HI> But may
<PB N="17" REF="004129_0019_1003D1FA04690358"/>
it not, with as much truth and justness, be added, as follows in the 10, 11, 12. verses, <HI>And all that genera∣tion were gathered unto their fathers: And there arose another generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he did for Israel. And the chil∣dren of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord,—and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers.—</HI></P>
<P>When we consider the great piety of our progeni∣tors; their reverence towards God, their love to the Lord Jesus Christ, their zeal for the purity of the Gospel worship, their contempt of the world, their self denying temper and conduct; and in a word, their holy and exemplary walk in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord: I say, when we consider these things, and then take a <HI>comparative view of our selves,</HI> we have reason to blush and be ashamed to think, how dreadfully we are degenerated. The holy God might lament over us, as he once did over his people <HI>Israel</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah 1. 4.</NOTE>, <HI>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil doers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the Lord, they have provoked the holy one of Israel to anger, they are gone away backward.</HI> We have risen up in our <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>faithful fathers</HI> stead, a generation that have wickedly departed from the Lord: And 'tis astonishing to think, to what a height we are grown in impiety and prophaneness, in formality and hypocrisy▪ in injustice and oppression, in pride and ambition, in covetousness and worldliness, in rioting and drunken∣ness, in chambering and wantonness, in voluptuousness and a universal debauchery of manners.</P>
<P>Upon this view of the state of things in our land, we have surely reason, infinite reason for humiliation and mourning; to lament not only the <HI>ceasing of the godly and faithful by death;</HI> but the <HI>ceasing of their Spirit,</HI> their piety and integrity, their zeal for God and the
<PB N="18" REF="004129_0020_1003D204024859C0"/>
establishment of true religion, thro' the prevalence of evil and all manner of wickedness, which, like an in∣creasing flood, threatens to overflow the land.</P>
<P>'Tis certainly time, high time to <HI>cry to God for help.</HI> And this we have been doing the <HI>week past,</HI> on the day of our solemn <HI>fasting and praying.</HI> But have we not reason for inquiry, did we then <HI>keep a fast unto God, even unto God, an acceptable fast, the fast which he hath chosen?</HI> If so, we shall not think it enough, that we have <HI>confessed</HI> and <HI>externally humbled</HI> our selves for our sins; but <HI>we</HI> shall <HI>forsake them,</HI> making it our care to <HI>turn every man from the evil of his ways.</HI> We shall <HI>loose the bands of wickedness, undo the heavy burdens, and let the oppressed go free.</HI> We shall <HI>deal our bread to the hungry, and bring the poor that are cast out to our house:</HI> When we <HI>see the naked we shall cover him,</HI> and we <HI>shall not hide our self from our own flesh. Then shall our light break forth as the morning, and our health shall spring forth speedily, and our righteousness shall go before us: the glory of the Lord shall be our rereward. Then shall we call, and the Lord shall answer; we shall cry, and he shall say, here I am.</HI> Then shall God appear for our help, revive among us the <HI>good spirit of our Godly faithful Progenitors; pour out his spirit upon us, and his blessing on our offspring:</HI> making our <HI>seed and name,</HI> like the <HI>new heavens and the new earth,</HI> to remain for ever.</P>
<P>But I shall be yet more particular, and take liberty to address the exhortation to <HI>this flock of our Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> calling upon you, to plead with God in the words of the text, <HI>Help Lord! for the Godly man ceaseth, for the faithful fail from among us.</HI></P>
<P>Great has been the <HI>ceasing of Godly Faithful</HI> persons among us, both <HI>men</HI> and <HI>women,</HI> within these few years. The <HI>ancient strong pillars</HI> of this Church are mostly thrown down by death. The <HI>hoary heads</HI> of those numbers of <HI>venerable aged disciples,</HI> which were once as a
<PB N="19" REF="004129_0021_1003D20585D875C0"/>
<HI>crown of glory</HI> to this assembly, are now laid in the dark and silent grave: and <HI>small is the remnant that is left.</HI> Like the <HI>gleaning of the vintage,</HI> they are thinly scat∣ter'd, but here and there one to be seen in the <HI>place of worship.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis worth our remark, the <HI>continuance of old men,</HI> the protracting their days, is particularly mention'd as one of the <HI>signal blessings</HI> of that <HI>happy time,</HI> which, ac∣cording to the <HI>promise of God,</HI> we are looking and hoping, and praying for. To this purpose we read, Isa. 65. 19, 20. <HI>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people:—There shall be no more thence an old man that hath not fill'd his days.</HI> And on the other hand, the <HI>ceasing of old men</HI> is made, in <HI>scripture,</HI> a very severe token of the Divine displeasure: according to that <HI>threatning of God</HI> against the <HI>house of Eli,</HI> 1 Sam. 2. 31. <HI>Behold the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy Father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house:</HI> Agreable whereto is that <HI>sorrowful exclamation,</HI> Isa. 3. 1, 2. <HI>For behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem, and from Judah,—the prudent and the ancient.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>general failing of aged saints</HI> should therefore be esteem'd a <HI>sorrowful humbling article,</HI> in the course of Divine providence. And as there has visibly been a <HI>very great ceasing</HI> of the <HI>aged disciples</HI> of this Church, we should, as 'tis our duty, religiously observe and re∣sent the hand of God herein.</P>
<P>But what I would more especially call upon you to lament is, the <HI>ceasing</HI> of those <HI>Godly</HI> and <HI>Faithful</HI> men, the manner of whose <HI>holy life</HI> and <HI>happy death</HI> is yet fresh in our remembrance.</P>
<P>The first whom it pleased God to remove from us, was taken out of the <HI>Seat of Deacons</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Zachariah Thayer,</HI> who died <HI>Feb.</HI> 7. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE>; a man of faith and prayer: full of <HI>Christ,</HI> and admiring adoring tho'ts
<PB N="20" REF="004129_0022_1003D20B99C05C88"/>
of the <HI>riches and freeness of sovereign grace</HI> towards lost and perishing sinners; an early convert, and a well-grown Christian; an exact and consciencious keeper of the sabbath; a devout and constant attender on the pub∣lick worship; a zealous and faithful reprover of sin; a known promoter of serious and heavenly discourse; a hearty mourner for the increasing badness of the times; a fast friend and well wisher to the interest of these Churches; and lastly, one who discharged the office he sustained among us, with fidelity to God, compassion and impartiality towards the poor, and acceptance among his brethren.</P>
<P>We were then called in the holy and righteous pro∣vidence of God, to resign up one of those <HI>good men</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Jonathan Jackson,</HI> who died <HI>May</HI> 4. 1736.</NOTE>, <HI>for whom,</HI> as the <HI>Apostle</HI> speaks, <HI>one would even dare to die; a devout man, and one that feared the Lord with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway;</HI> a man universally beloved and well spo∣ken of, for his meek and quiet spirit; his humble, peaceable and inoffensive carriage; his large and sea∣sonable charities, which were ever going up <HI>for a memo∣rial before God;</HI> and in a word, his strong and steady faith in God and Christ, and things unseen and eternal: discovering it self in a holy contempt of the world, with all its pomps and vanities; an uninterrupted wil∣lingness; yea, constant desire, in the midst of riches and plenty, to depart hence to <HI>be with Christ,</HI> which he esteemed <HI>far better</HI> than to abide here.</P>
<P>And more lately, one<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Nicholas Buttolph,</HI> who died <HI>Jan.</HI> 28. 1736, 7▪</NOTE> from the <HI>second Seat,</HI> was selected for death and suddenly taken from us; a man of solid and substantial religion; pious towards God and righteous towards men; sober in his life, exact and regular in his whole conduct; a constant mantainer of good order and religious duties in his family; of an

upright heart, and a blameless and exemplary con∣versation.</P>
<P>And more lately still, we have been call'd to mourn the death of one, who, tho' not related to us these few last years, was yet formerly, and for a long course of time, your <HI>faithful laborious Pastor</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Benjamin Wadsworth,</HI> the Reverend <HI>President of Harvard College,</HI> who died March 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE>: than whom, per∣haps, few were more constant and diligent in employing their time and talents in the service, and to the honour of God: And not many have been more instrumental of spiritual and eternal good to the souls of men. I doubt not, he has a testimony in the hearts of many of you, to his care of your souls, his consciencious ar∣duous endeavours to bring you to God, in the way of true and undefiled religion. You are all witnesses of his holy and heavenly walk among you; of his being to you <HI>an example, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</HI>—But his excellent cha∣racter having been already laid open to you, by a better and more proper hand, I shall only add that <HI>exhortation</HI> of the <HI>apostle,</HI> adapting it to the present case, Heb. 13. 7. <HI>Remember him, who had the rule over you, who spoke unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of his conversation.</HI></P>
<P>It remains now to take some proper notice of the more special occasion of my bringing you such a dis∣course at this time; the death of that <HI>valuable</HI> person, it pleased the holy God to take from us the last week.</P>
<P>I could not refrain from dropping a tear over his grave: Nor can I suppose, that any that knew him will except against a publick recommending an exam∣ple, in many respects, so worthy of imitation.</P>
<P>The person, whose decease we are lamenting, was an instance of <HI>early piety.</HI> He <HI>betimes</HI> enter'd upon a religious course, and had made good progress in the way of God's commandments. He was a chearful,
<PB N="22" REF="004129_0024_1003D2144DD3E2F0"/>
active, good Christian; a hearty lover of God and all good men; especially the Godly faithful Ministers of Christ, whom he highly esteemed for their work's sake, often shewing them the kindness of the Lord. He was a man of prayer; constant at the house and worship of God; true to his word; punctual to his engagements; sincere in his professions; charitable in his deeds, being always ready to every good work; an upright, sober, honest, faithful man; one that <HI>feared God above many,</HI> and <HI>walk'd in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</HI></P>
<P>As a <HI>Deacon,</HI> he was <HI>grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience:</HI> And he <HI>used his office, being found blameless.</HI> He was indeed excellently turn'd and spirited to it; and by his active, constant, prudent and faithful attendance on the duties of it, was a signal blessing in his place, and known and acknowledg'd to be so.</P>
<P>It may be said of him, with truth and justice, he was generally beloved while <HI>living,</HI> and as generally lamen∣ted now he is <HI>dead.</HI> And in <HI>his death,</HI> the <HI>Town</HI> have lost a man <HI>useful in his generation;</HI> the <HI>Church,</HI> a <HI>faithful officer</HI> as well as <HI>generous benefactor;</HI> and the <HI>poor,</HI> an <HI>open-banded</HI> and <HI>compassionate friend.</HI></P>
<P>I shall only add, as he was one who <HI>lived to Christ,</HI> we have reason to hope he <HI>died in him:</HI> And of such the apostle <HI>John</HI> speaks in that remarkable language, Rev. 14. 13. <HI>I heard a voice from heaven, saying to me, write, blessed are the dead which are in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, saith the spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them.</HI></P>
<P>A thought comforting and refreshing! and should be as a spring of joy to the <HI>mourning children,</HI> who should temper their sorrow with the <HI>good hope</HI> they have, that 'tis now well with their <HI>departed father</HI> in the <HI>paradise of God.</HI> Be thankful <HI>you mourn not as
<PB N="23" REF="004129_0025_1003D21851E321D0"/>
those who have no hope: For if Christ died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus, will God bring with him.</HI> Wherefore <HI>comfort</HI> your selves and <HI>one another with these words.</HI> And beware of witholding from God the glory of his sovereign dominion. <HI>Be dumb with silence,</HI> and <HI>open not your mouths,</HI> unless it be to acknowledge and adore the sovereignty, and holi∣ness, and wisdom, and righteousness of this dispensation; and to supplicate at the throne of God all that support and comfort you need. And let it be your care to make a wise and holy use of this providence. Learn herefrom the uncertainty of all earthly enjoyments; and more than ever trust in God, and make him your hope and happiness. Chuse your <HI>father's God</HI> for <HI>your God;</HI> and <HI>know him and serve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind:</HI> So will he be your friend and father; your guide thro' the world; your guide thro' death, and <HI>your portion for ever.</HI></P>
<P>And now, my <HI>brethren,</HI> the ceasing of such <HI>godly</HI> and <HI>faithful men by death,</HI> is a frown of providence, and a sore breach upon us. Let us not be insensible of our <HI>great loss</HI> in the <HI>many deaths,</HI> there have been, of late, among us. Our glory is hereby thinned, our strength impaired, and we are gradually becoming weak and feeble. Let us lift up a cry to almighty God with holy <HI>David, Help Lord! for the Godly man ceaseth; for the Faithful fail from among the children of men.</HI> And let there be no reason for that com∣plaint, <HI>the righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart.</HI> Let us duly resent the removal of our <HI>pious brethren in Christ,</HI> and be concerned to see their places fill'd. And let us be constant and fervent in our ap∣plications to God, to <HI>be the repairer of our breaches;</HI> to make <HI>daily additions</HI> to us, of those who shall be men of like piety and integrity, with those who are gone off the stage.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="004129_0026_1003D21D95B9B4E0"/>
I shall only add, have we not reason to fear, whether there han't been a <HI>far more awful ceasing</HI> of the Godly and faithful from among us, through the <HI>growing wick∣edness of the present day,</HI> than by means of <HI>death?</HI> O let us lament our grievous <HI>departures from the living God!</HI> He, <HI>which searcheth the reins and hearts,</HI> might justly bespeak us, as he once did the <HI>Church of Ephesus, I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. 2. 4.</NOTE>.
