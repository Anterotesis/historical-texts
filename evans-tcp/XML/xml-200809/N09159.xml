<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Honours, and you Gentlemen of the Jury.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE prisoners at the bar, are that party of soldiers be∣longing to his Majesty's 29th regiment, who in the evening of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> last, were induced from some cause or other to fire on the inhabitants of this town, in <HI>King street.</HI></P>
<P>They are charged in five distinct indictments, with the wilful premeditated murder of five different persons mentioned in the respective bills; to each of these indict∣ments, they have severally pleaded, <HI>not guilty</HI>; and by that plea have thrown upon the crown the burthen of proving the fact alledged against them: It is my province therefore to give you evidence in support of this charge, and yours, gentlemen of the Jury, to determine whether they are guil∣ty, or not.</P>
<P>The cause is solemn and important; no less than whe∣ther eight of your fellow subjects shall live or die! A cause grounded on the most melancholy event that has yet taken place on the continent of <HI>America,</HI> and perhaps of the greatest expectation of any that has yet come before a tri∣bunal of civil justice, in this part of the <HI>British</HI> dominions.</P>
<P>I am aware how difficult, in cases of this sort, it ever is, and more especially so in <HI>these times,</HI> and in <HI>this trial,</HI> to pre∣serve the mind perfectly indifferent; but I remember, we are bound, not only by the natural obligations towards God and man, but also by an oath, to examine into the evi∣dence of fact without <HI>partiality</HI> or <HI>prejudice;</HI> I need not therefore caution you of your duty in this respect: It is upon that evidence and the law resulting from it, you gen∣tlemen are, in the language of your oath, to give a ver∣dict; and I will venture, before hand, to pronounce that verdict <HI>righteous,</HI> if it is founded in these principles as the rule of your judgment.</P>
<P>It has become my duty, it shall therefore be my en∣deavor, to acquit myself in the course of this trial with
<PB N="10" REF="011683_0006_0F87C824B7E3F7D8"/>
<HI>decency</HI> and <HI>candour;</HI> reflecting, that however interest∣ing the question may be, the object of our enquiry is sim∣ply that of truth, and that this enquiry is to be conducted by the wisdom of the laws and constitution.</P>
<P>In support of this accusation against the prisoners at the bar, it is incumbent on the crown, to ascertain the follow∣ing things; viz. The indentity of the persons charged; the fact of killing; and the circumstances attending and aggravating that fact.</P>
<P>To this end, I shall immediately produce to you such e∣vidence, from the testimony of credible witnesses, as may be sufficient to sustain the several indictments, and when I have gone through the examination, make such remarks upon it, as may be most concise and pertinent to the pre∣sent issue.</P>

<P>Where did you stand at the firing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I kept my place. At the time of the firing of the first gun, I heard a clattering noise on the right like one gun striking against another, and immediately the first gun was fired from the right.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the time of firing that gun was any assault made on the person that fired?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was the place where he fell nearly opposite to the tall man you talk of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; the gun that killed him, must have been nearer to the center. When the soldiers on the left fired, there were fewer people on the street.</P>

<P>Did you see a molatto among those persons who sur∣rounded the soldiers?</P>

<P>Did the clattering or blows on the guns to the right, im∣mediately before the first gun went off, appear very violent?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, very violent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where was the second gun fired from?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I saw him aim at a lad that was running down the middle of the street, and kept the motion of his gun after him a considerable time, and then fired.</P>

<P>Did the lad fall?</P>

<P>After the firing of the first gun did the people dis∣perse?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did the people that came down the street, endeavour to join the party that was striking the soldiers, or did they come because of the ringing of the bells?</P>
</SP>

<P>I believe they came because the bells were ringing, for they came from all parts of the town, and did not ap∣pear to me to join in the assault.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was you so near <HI>Gray,</HI> that if he had thrown any thing you must have seen it?</P>
</SP>

<P>Yes, his hands were in his bosom, and, immediately after <HI>Killroy's</HI> firing, he fell.</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I saw nothing thrown. I heard the rattling of their guns, and took it to be one gun against another. this rattling was at the time <HI>Killroy</HI> fired, and at my right, I had a fair view of them; I saw no body strike a blow nor offer a blow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you any doubt in your own mind, that it was that gun of <HI>Killroy's</HI> that killed <HI>Gray</HI>?</P>

<P>About ten minutes after nine, I saw a soldier, and a mean looking fellow with him, with a cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lass in his hand; they came up to me: somebody said, put up your cutlass, it is not right to carry it at this time of night. He said, damn you ye Yankie bougers, what's your business: he came up to another that was with me, and struck him. We beat him back, when seven or eight soldiers came out of the barracks, with tongs and other weapons; one aimed a blow at a young fellow, <HI>John Hicks,</HI> who knocked the sol∣dier down. As he attempted to rise, I struck him down a∣gain, and broke his wrist, as I heard afterwards. I went to <HI>King-street,</HI> and when the guns were all fired, I saw se∣veral persons dead.</P>

<P>Please to inform the Court and Jury what you saw there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I came up <HI>Royal-exchange-lane,</HI> and as I got to the head of it, I saw the Sentry on the steps of the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> with his bayonet breast high, with a number of boys round him:
<PB N="21" REF="011683_0011_0F87C828A00C1A00"/>
—I called to him, and said, I did not think any body was going to do him harm. I saw Capt. <HI>Preston</HI> and some sol∣diers come down.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which of the prisoners was the Sentry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell, I was not so high him as to know his face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>How many boys were there round him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think about twenty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>How old were these boys?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>About fourteen or fifteen years old, perhaps some of them older, I saw no men there except one, who came up <HI>Royal-exchange lane</HI> with me, thinking it was fire. He went back again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>What did you take to be the reason that the Sentry charged his bayonet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could not tell what the reason was; there was no body troubling him. I was at the corner of <HI>Royal-exchange-lane,</HI> and a young man went up to the Sentry and spoke to him; what he said I do not know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there in the time of the firing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I went towards the Sentry-box, there I saw Capt. <HI>Preston.</HI> I said to him, Sir, I hope you are not going to fire, for every body is going to their own homes. He said I hope they are. I saw no more of him. He immediately went in amongst the soldiers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>What number of soldiers were there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think seven or eight, I did not count them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did Capt. <HI>Preston</HI> lead or follow them down?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think he was upon the right of them. As they came down they had their guns charged breast high. I saw <HI>Christopher Monk,</HI> who was wounded that night, I turned to speak to him, and directly they fired, and he seemed to faulter. I said are you wounded, he said yes. I replied, I do not think it, for I then apprehended they fired only powder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it the first gun that you thought wounded <HI>Monk?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you see any of these prisoners there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I saw <HI>Killroy,</HI> and that he was the man who struck me with his bayonet, when they came down, before they formed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did any body near you do any violence to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>How near were you to the soldiers when they fired?</P>

<P>Could you see the whole party?</P>

<P>Where did the firing begin?</P>

<P>Did you know him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did the man that struck you do it on purpose, or ac∣cidentally, do you think?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think he did it on purpose, I apprehended it so; I was standing by the gutter, and he was before me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Said he any thing to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, nor I to him: he came to form, and I was closer than I wished I was, and he struck me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>How came you to speak to the Sentry, and tell him not to be afraid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he was swinging his gun in that manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you come up <HI>Royal exchange-lane?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. I saw Doctor <HI>Young</HI> there, and several others coming up to know where the fire was; Doctor <HI>Young</HI> said it was not fire, but that the soldiers had made a rumpus, but were gone to their barracks again. Then said I let e∣very man go to his own home.</P>

I went down there, and saw four or five soldiers, with their guns and bayonets; I told the offi∣cer who stood by, I was surprised they suffered the soldiers to be out at that time of night; an officer said, do you pre∣tend to teach us our duty Sir, I said no, only to remind you of it: You see, says he, the soldiers are in their barracks, why do not you go home.

I left Mr. <HI>Spear,</HI> and went down, and saw Capt. <HI>Preston</HI> at the head of seven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or eight soldiers, with their guns, and bayonets fixed; I went to Capt. <HI>Preston,</HI> and saw Mr. <HI>Theodore Bliss</HI> talking with him, who said to Capt. <HI>Preston,</HI>
"Why do you not fire," "God damn you fire." I stept betwixt them and asked Capt. <HI>Preston</HI> if the soldiers were loaded, he said yes, with powder and ball: I said, I hope Sir you are not going to fire upon the inhabitants, he said by no means: That in∣stant I saw a piece of ice strike <HI>Montgomery</HI>'s gun, whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t sallied him back, or he stept one foot back. I do not know, but he recovered himself, and fired immediately.

The soldier immediate∣ly repaired to the <HI>Custom house</HI> door, he was at the west corner of the house before; there, with a large brass knocker, gave three loud and remarkable strokes.</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not hear. The soldier then turned about and loaded his gun, and knocked it twice very loud on the steps; then he went to the west corner of the house where he had been before, the people gathered round him; I went with him, and I cast my eye up <HI>King-street,</HI> and saw an officer and seven men, they came to the west corner of the <HI>Custom-house.</HI></P>

<P>Were the soldiers formed before they loaded?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I heard, damn you fire: it seemed to me as it came from the Sentry-box where I left the <HI>Captain.</HI> I was then by <HI>Vernon</HI> the barber's shop; I had passed across the street. I saw a man going to throw a club, I begged of him not to do it, for I said if he did, the soldiers would certainly fire: he said, he would not, and did not. I then saw a white club thrown at some distance from me towards the soldier's; immediately I heard the word present, I stooped down, a little space of time ensued, I heard damn you fire: two guns were discharged then as I judged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Not so as to know them again. That evening, at the cry of fire, I came out of my house, and saw the people running down town, and I followed them; when I got by the <HI>Town-house,</HI> I saw some going down <HI>King-street,</HI> I went down also: At the <HI>Guard house,</HI> I saw a number of the sol∣diers running; I asked where was the fire, no body answer∣ed me. I went down to the middle of <HI>King-street,</HI> and while I stood there, was pushed from behind me with a bayonet. I turned round and saw a party of soldiers coming down, I asked one the reason of his pushing at me? he dumn'd my blood, and bid me stand out of their way, I said I would not, I was doing no harm to any man, and would not stand aside for any one; they passed me some on one side, some on the other. They came to the Sentry-box, faced round and formed a circle. I spoke to some of the inhabitants to speak to <HI>Preston,</HI> to know what the matter was; some body spoke to him, but what was said, I do not know. I saw <HI>Preston</HI> fall in betwixt the fourth and fifth man, the word was given fire! immediately the right hand man fired; after that I pushed in towards them, and they run a bayonet at me and wounded me in my arm.</P>

I passed on, the bells still kept ringing, I came to <HI>Dock square,</HI> and was informed much to the same purpose; there were some persons there, who told me it was dangerous to go up; they seemed to be like people that were afraid to pass, because of the danger, others were going up, I went up, when I got past the ally, the street was very clear of people, I hardly saw any body.—
<PB N="43" REF="011683_0022_0F87C836291C1FC8"/>
I came to the <HI>Town-house,</HI> and saw a few lads, but no great number, I have often seen more collected for their diver∣sion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>How many people were there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>From twenty to thirty. I saw the Sentry upon the steps of the <HI>Custom house</HI> door, but I heard him say nothing, but he had his gun waving as if it was to defend himself, or to exasperate the people. I thought to speak to him, but I thought he might insult me, and therefore I declin∣ed; I went in order to go away, and met the party com∣ing down; that made me stop, because when they got to the <HI>Custom house,</HI> there was a noise something like what they call cheers, and the people went more to the middle of the street; after the soldiers had passed through them, I went down again, as I passed before them, there was very few people there, I passed without the people, and inclin∣ed more to the <HI>Custom house,</HI> the greatest part of the soldi∣ers were full to my view; the people that were there, were collected in a body at the end of <HI>Royal exchange lane,</HI> they did not go so high as Mr. <HI>Stone</HI>'s house.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where did you stand?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was walking right before them. They had their guns rested on their hips; when I passed the last man on the left, the first gun was fired from the right; as I judged, the time might be twenty seconds before the first gun was fired from the time they formed, in a short space there was another, and then very soon another, and then there was a short space of time again, before the last guns were fired. A little boy run along and cryed, fire! fire! fire! as people generally do when there is fire, a soldier pointed his gun to him and fired, but did not hit him, he was the last but one on the left.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did the people appear to be passing off after the first gun?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not mind the first gun, I thought it was only powder to scare them; but when the next was fired, they were a scattering. After the firing ceased, a little boy came and told us some persons were killed. I saw them lye in the street, but I did not imagine it was any body killed, but that they had been scared and run away, and left their great coat's behind them: I saw nothing like an attack that could produce any such consequences: I went to look at the Malatto man, and heard a noise like the cocking of fire∣locks,

I went towards home, and stopped at the bottom of <HI>Long lane,</HI> and while I was talking there, I heard guns go off. I went to <HI>King-street,</HI> and was told several were killed, I then went home. <HI>Samuel Gray,</HI> when I saw him that night, was quite calm, and had no stick.</P>

<P>Not that I can swear to as they are dressed. I can re∣collect something of their faces, but cannot swear to them. When I came to <HI>King street,</HI> I went immediately up to one of the soldiers, which I take to be that man who is bald on the head, (<HI>pointing to</HI> Montgomery) I asked him if any of the soldiers were loaded, he said yes.

<P>A young man that boarded with me, and was at the Rope-walks, told me several of them had a spite at him, and that he believed he was in danger. I had seen two sol∣diers about my house, I saw one of them hearkening at the window, I saw him again near the house, and asked him
<PB N="46" REF="011683_0024_0F87C8385C723618"/>
what he was after; he said he was pumping ship: Was it not you, says I, that was hearkening at my window last night? what if it was, he said, I told him to march off, and he damned me, and I beat him till he had enough of it, and he then went off. The reason of carrying the sword, was, they spyed the young man in the lane, and dogg'd him, for he had been very active in the affray at the Rope∣walks, and they said they would some time or other have satisfaction, and I looked upon myself to be liable to be in∣sulted likewise. When alarmed by the cry of fine, and I had got below the house, my wife called after me, and said it is not fire, it is an affray in <HI>King-street,</HI> if you are going take this, so I took it, and run down, and I asked the sol∣dier what I just now told you. I knocked the bayonet with what I had in my hand, another pushed at me, I struck his gun; my face was now towards the soldiers. I heard the first gun go off, and then the second gun went off. As I was looking to see if any body was killed, I saw the tall man standing in a line with me. I saw him fall.</P>

I tryed to press into the midst of them to know what they were about; I could not get in; I therefore stepped over the gutter, and saw the soldiers, se∣ven or eight of them, by the Sentry box. Some of the people were leaning on their sticks, some standing with their hands in their bosoms, and some were whistling. Numbers were crouding to get in as I was. I had my eye on the right hand man. Somebody said, do not press on the soldiers, I repeated the same words, do not press on the soldiers: when I said that, I saw something like a flash at my left, and heard the report of a gun, and the people o∣pened from right to left; but I could not see where the gun was fired from; it made a noise like a pistol, and I i∣magined it was nothing but powder.

I do not know what it was, but I went in as fall as I could, and shut the door immediately. They were within half a foot of it, had it been open a second longer they would have had the command of the door, but I was too quick for them and bolted my door, went up chamber, looked out of my window, and saw people flying here and

<P>I was at Col <HI>Jackson</HI>'s a few minutes after nine on the 5th of <HI>March.</HI> When I came out into <HI>Dock square,</HI> the square was entirely quiet, I saw no persons in the whole square. I came up <HI>Royal exchange-lane,</HI> I saw nobody there. I saw the Sentry at the head of it in peace and quietness, nobody trou∣bling him: I never saw <HI>King-street</HI> more quiet in my life. I went into my house, where was a kinsman of mine; I asked him how he did, and while I was speaking the young man in the shop knocked for me, I went into the shop, and in a half a minute, I heard the cry of murder once or twice; there is mischief said I, at a distance, so there is said he; I opened the front door to see, I saw nobody. I heard a sad noise, which seemed to come from <HI>Rowe</HI>'s bar∣racks. I stopped a little space, and the first I saw enter <HI>King-street,</HI> was a party from the <HI>Main-Guard,</HI> ten or twelve came rushing out violently, I saw their arms glitter by the moon light, hallowing damn them where are they, by Jesus let them come. Some of them turned into <HI>Pudding-lane,</HI> and some went by the <HI>Town-house</HI> steps; I went in and told my family to keep themselves easy, for there was no distur∣bance near the house. I went to the door again, and saw a party about the head of <HI>Quaker-lane,</HI> and they used much
<PB N="52" REF="011683_0027_0F87C83DA0E00400"/>
the same expressions as the aforesaid party, and hallowed fire. They passed over the way, and the shade of the moon light hindered me to see if they went down <HI>Royal-exchange-lane</HI> or went up towards the <HI>Town-house</HI> Something strikes my mind, I am not positive now, but I think it was that night, there were a few boys round the Sentry. I went and said, boys you have no business with the Sentry, go off, and they went off. I have often seen boys with the Sentry, and heard words often. The bells were then ringing, and the people began to collect as they do at the cry of fire, and I began to think it was fire. I had a mind to get my staff and go out, but I had a reluctance, because I had been warned not to go out that night: but while the people were collecting, I came to the door, and saw them gather∣ing thick from all quarters, forty, fifty or sixty. When the party came down, I thought it was no more than I had seen every day, I thought they had come to relieve the Sen∣try, they seemed to be in a posture of defence, and came through the people. I saw no opposition. When they came up, they passed out of the moon light into the dark, so that I could not see them, but I wondered to find them tar∣ry so long. I heard a gun go off, I thought it was an acci∣dent, but in a little time another gun went off, and a third and fourth, pretty quick, and then the fifth. There seem∣ed to be a small stop in their firing, I than had no concern, but before the smoke was well away, I saw the people dead on the ground. I saw no opposition when they were drawn up, the people were not near them; what oppositi∣on might be at the lane I could not perceive, because the box covered that from my view.</P>

<P>The evidence for the Crown being closed, <HI>Samuel Quincy,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> then addressed the Court and Jury, as follows:</P>
<Q><TEXT>
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Honours, and you Gentlemen of the Jury.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING gone through the evidence on the part of the crown, it is my province to support the charge against the prisoners. The examination hath been lengthy, and from the nature of the transaction complex, and in some part difficult; I shall apply it as distinctly as I am able, with∣out endeavouring to misrepresent or aggravate any thing to the prejudice of the prisoners on the one hand, or on the other to neglect any thing that justice to the deceased suf∣ferers, the laws of my country, or the preservation of the peace of society demand.</P>
<P>There are two things necessary to prove, which I men∣tioned in the first opening of this cause, namely, the iden∣tity of the prisoners, that is, that they were that party of men who on the 5th of <HI>March</HI> last were in <HI>King-street,</HI> and that they committed the facts mentioned in the indictments, and farther gentlemen, the circumstances attending and aggravating the commission of those facts.</P>
<P>As to the first point, to prove the identity of the prison∣ers, all of them have been sworn to, and most of them by more than one witness.</P>
<P>To <HI>KILLROY</HI> gentlemen, you have <HI>Langford, Archibald</HI> and <HI>Brewer,</HI> who swear positively; and farther you have the evidence of <HI>Ferriter</HI> and <HI>Hemmingway.</HI> The one, of <HI>Killroy</HI>'s being in the affray at the rope-walks, and the o∣ther to his uttering a number of malicious and threatning expressions in regard to the inhabitants of the town of <HI>Bos∣ton.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>WHITE</HI> gentlemen, you have four more, <HI>Simpson, Langford, Bailey</HI> and <HI>Clark.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>MONTGOMERY,</HI> you have <HI>Bailey, Palmes, Bass, Dan∣brook</HI> and <HI>Wilkinson.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>HARTEGAN,</HI> you have <HI>Danbrook</HI> and <HI>Simpson.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>WEMMS,</HI> you have <HI>Simpson</HI> and <HI>Bridgham.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="011683_0028_0F87C83E6180FEF0"/>To <HI>CARROL, Bailey</HI> and <HI>Danbrook.</HI></P>
<P>To <HI>WARREN, Bridgham, Dodge</HI> and <HI>Simpson. Bridgham</HI> indeed expressed some doubt, and gave his reasons for it, which may be worthy notice hereafter.</P>
<P>To <HI>M'CAULEY,</HI> you have Mr. <HI>Austin.</HI></P>
<P>And that <HI>Warren</HI> was at the Rope-walks, you have also the testimony of Mr. <HI>Ferriter.</HI></P>
<P>All these witnesses as I have mentioned them to you, have testified on oath to the several prisoners, that they were that evening in <HI>King-street,</HI> and of the party; the next thing to be enquired into gentlemen is as to the facts. In order to ascertain these it will be necessary to have re∣course to the testimony of the witnesses. I could have wished I had been able, after the fatigue of yesterday, to have ranged the evidence in the order of time as the facts took place; but not being able to do this, I must take them up as the witnesses were examined. I will however endeavour to state the facts in the best arrangement I can.</P>
<P>The first witness Mr. <HI>Austin,</HI> says, that he was in <HI>King-street</HI> that evening, near the Sentry-box which was pla∣ced at the <HI>Custom-house</HI>; that about a quarter after nine he saw the party coming from the <HI>Main-guard</HI>; when they got down to the Sentry box, they wheeled to the left and formed themselves round it; and in coming round <HI>M'Cauley</HI> pushed at him with his bayonet, damned him, and bid him to stand off, this was the first instance of their conduct. Mr. <HI>Austin</HI> was not paticular who fired, his back being towards the soldiers when that happened. He says there were five or six guns fired; and he saw <HI>M'Cauley</HI> after the firing. These are the most material circumstances of his testimony.</P>
<P>The next witness is <HI>Bridgham,</HI> who says he was in <HI>King-street</HI> also; and the next morning when he went to the goal to view the prisoners, he apprehended he had seen <HI>Warren</HI> in <HI>King street</HI> the evening before, but afterwards he saw a person that looked very like him belonging to the same regiment, which occasioned him to doubt whether he was the man or not; my remark upon this, is, it was probable that the first impressions made on his mind were the strong∣est, and therefore you cannot well doubt he was right in judging that <HI>Warren</HI> was in fact the person he saw the e∣vening before; he saw also <HI>Wemms</HI> the corporal stationed on the left of the party betwixt him and the tall man; the <HI>Corporal</HI> was on the left entire, if so gentlemen, <HI>War∣ren</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="011683_0029_0F87C840245E7490"/>
must have been the third man from the left in that si∣tuation; there were a number of people he says round the party huzzaing, some having sticks; his face was the other way when the first gun went off, he heard a noise like the clashing of guns, he saw <HI>Gray</HI> fall, and says the person that killed him, must have been near the center of the par∣ty; when the left man fired there were but few in the street, they divided and were passing off; the last man that fired, he says leveled his piece, following a lad that was running down the street before he fired; he also mentions a number of people coming down from the north side of the <HI>Town-house,</HI> collected as he supposed by the bells, and not dispos∣ed to commit any injury whatsoever; he did not apprehend himself, or the soldiers in any danger from any thing he observed; he says about seven guns were fired, and there were about twelve people at that time before the party.— These are the most material circumstances in his evidence.</P>
<P><HI>Dodge</HI> says, he saw <HI>Warren,</HI> but cannot swear to any of the rest, the man who fired first he thinks stood towards the left, about two from the corner, however he was over at <HI>Vernon</HI>'s shop across the street, and perhaps not able to make so good observations as some others; he saw about fifty people in the street, but he saw nothing in their hands; he saw a number of snow balls thrown, but none as he observed with violence or in anger; he saw the people near the party of soldiers, and they pushing at them with their bayonets; he does not imagine there was any thing besides snow balls thrown.</P>
<P><HI>Clark</HI> the next witness, saw <HI>White</HI> the Sentinel at his station just before nine o'clock, that he spoke to him, but saw no one at that time near or molesting him.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Langford</HI> comes next, and this witness is perhaps as particular as any one witness on the part of the Crown; it appears by the relation of his evidence that he came down about nine o'clock as a watchman, in order to go to the <HI>Watch-house</HI> next adjoining the <HI>Town house</HI>; when he came down, he was told the people and soldiers were fighting at <HI>Murray</HI>'s <HI>Barracks;</HI> upon this, he took his course that way, but the matter being over by the time h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> got there, he returned to <HI>King-street</HI>: there were a number of boys round the Sentinel, to whom he spoke and told hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he need not fear, the boys would not hurt him; soon after this the Sentinel without saying any thing to the people
<PB N="57" REF="011683_0029_0F87C840245E7490"/>
went up the <HI>Custom-house</HI> steps and knocked at the door; a person within opened it and said something, but what, the witness did not hear; upon that the Sentinel turned round, and pointed his piece at the people opposite to him. <HI>Langford</HI> spoke again, and told him there was no danger, the boys would not hurt him, and he shouldered. The witness con∣tinued talking with the Sentry till the party came down, and then he went into the street. About this time <HI>Gray,</HI> one of the unhappy sufferers, came and clapped <HI>Langford</HI> on the shoulder, saying what's here to pay? <HI>Langford</HI> replies, I do not know, but something I believe will come of it by and by; his stand was half way as he said betwixt the Sentry-box and <HI>Royal exchange-lane</HI>; the box being on the right corner of the lane, and he opposite the center of the lane; the wit∣ness and <HI>Gray</HI> were standing together talking familiarly, <HI>Langford</HI> leaning on his stick, and <HI>Gray</HI> standing with his hands folded in his bosom, without a stick in his hand, nei∣ther saying or doing any thing to the soldiers You can∣not but recollect Gentlemen, that this witness was expressly and repeatedly asked, if <HI>Gray</HI> had a stick, or said any thing to the soldiers? he as often answered no. <HI>Langford</HI> spoke to <HI>Killroy,</HI> and after two guns were discharged, seeing him present his piece, said to him, damn you are you going to fire? Presently upon this, <HI>Killroy</HI> levelled his piece, and firing directly at <HI>Gray,</HI> killed him dead on the spot! The ball passed through his head, and he fell on <HI>Lang∣ford</HI>'s left foot; upon which, not satisfied with having mur∣dered one of his fellow creatures in that cruel and inhu∣man manner, he pushed with his bayonet, and pierced <HI>Lang∣ford</HI> through his great coat and jacket; here Gentlemen, if any there can be, is evidence, and I think compleat evidence of a heart desperately wicked, and bent upon mischief, the true characteristic of a wilful malicious murderer.</P>
<P>It could not be thought, at the distance the witness and <HI>Gray</HI> were standing from him, without offering any vio∣lence, but <HI>Killroy</HI> the prisoner saw them distinctly, and ai∣med to destroy them; if you compare this testimony with Mr. <HI>Hemmingway</HI>'s who swears to <HI>Killroy</HI>'s uttering expres∣sious importing, that he would miss no opportunity of fir∣ing on the inhabitants, he had wished for it ever since he landed, you certainly Gentlemen can have no doubt in your minds but that he had that intention at heart, and took this opportunity to execute it.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="011683_0030_0F87C841185B90B0"/>The crime of murder, Gentlemen, it will be agreed by all, necessarily involves in it the malice of the heart, and that malice is to be collected from the circumstances atten∣ding the action; but it is not necessary to constitute ma∣lice, that it should be harboured long in the breast; a dis∣tinction is made in the books betwixt malice and hatred, and a good distinction it is; I have it in my hand and will read it;</P>
<P>KELYNCE 126, and 127. MAWGRIDGE's CASE.
<Q>Some have been led into mistake by not well considering what the pas∣sion of malice is; they have construed it to be a rancour of mind lodged in the person killing, for some considerable time before the commission of the fact, which is a mistake arising from their not well distinguishing between <HI>hatred</HI> and <HI>malice,</HI></Q>
And a little after,
<Q>Malice is a design formed of doing mis∣chief to another; <HI>cum quis data opera male agit,</HI> he that de∣signs and useth the means to do ill is malicious: <HI>2 Inst. 42.</HI> He that doth a cruel act voluntarily, doth it of malice propens∣ed.</Q>
3 Inst. 62.</P>
<P>Though Gentlemen, it happens on a sudden occasion as this was, if the act is in it's nature wanton and cruel, the law will presume it to be malicious, unless that presumption is taken off by contrary evidence.</P>
<P><HI>Ferriter,</HI> who testified to the same person, tells you, he was remarkably active at the Rope walks amongst the rest of the soldiers; taking therefore all the circumstances of this testimony together, it must remove every sort of diffi∣culty in your minds as to the purpose <HI>Killroy</HI> had at that time; it seems apparent that there were strong marks of malice in his heart; the person you can have no doubt of, the fact you can have no doubt of, nor can you I think doubt of the species of crime.</P>
<P>The next witness, who also testifies to <HI>Killroy</HI>'s going down, and being of the party, swears that he was about twenty feet from the party when the first gun was fired; that he also had been, previous to this, at <HI>Murray</HI>'s barracks, when the affray happened there, and tells you the behavi∣our of the soldiers in that scene.</P>
<P><HI>Brewer,</HI> another witness also swears to <HI>Killroy.</HI> He saw the Sentinel on the <HI>Custom-house</HI> steps; at that time there were about twenty people, boys chiefly about fourteen, and some younger, round about him, but they made no great show; he saw the Captain come down with the
<PB N="59" REF="011683_0030_0F87C841185B90B0"/>
party, the Sentinel at this time had his gun breast high; that while the witness was speaking to <HI>Monk,</HI> (a young lad who was wounded) he lost sight of <HI>Preston</HI> and the guns went off: <HI>Monk</HI> complained of being shot, but <HI>Brewer</HI> ap∣prehended it was nothing but powder, and that he was more frightened than hurt; the firing began at the right and ex∣tended to the corner man on the left. <HI>Killroy</HI> attacked this witness in the same manner <HI>M'Cauley</HI> did <HI>Austin,</HI> by pushing at him with his bayonet; a number were collected by the ringing of the bells, but he heard nothing particular in re∣gard to abusive language; he saw no snow balls thrown, and when the soldiers came down, he heard some of the people crying fire, and that was the general cry; some crying fire because the bells rung, some, no doubt fire, to the soldiers, daring them to it; but of this no great can be made in the present case. There were seven guns he says fired, he was certain as to the number, having counted them himself. He says further, he met Dr. <HI>Young</HI> in <HI>Dock-square</HI> and that he had a sword; the witness said, let every man go to his own home, and the Doctor replied, that is the best way, the soldiers are gone to their barracks: per∣haps something will be attempted to be made of this cir∣cumstance, and therefore I shall make an observation upon it.—If you attend to the testimony of several of the wit∣nesses, there were that evening in the streets at all parts of the town, a number of soldiers; they failled out from <HI>Murray</HI>'s barracks and every where with clubs, cutlasses, and other weapons of death; this occasioned a general alarm; every man therefore had a right, and very prudent it was to endea∣vour to defend himself if attacked; this accounts for the reason of Dr. <HI>Young</HI> or any one inhabitant of the town having a sword that evening; the Doctor surely could not be supposed to have any intention of mischief, because the same witness tells you his cry was, the soldiers were gone to their barracks, and go every man to his own home.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bailey</HI> the next witness, testifies as to the identity of some of the party, that there were <HI>Montgomery, Carrol</HI> and <HI>White</HI> there; that he placed himself at the post by the <HI>Cus∣tom-House,</HI> and stood there all the time; that there were a∣bout twenty boys, some fourteen years old, and some under that; he was near the Sentinel when the party came down; <HI>Carrol</HI> pointed at his breast with his bayonet, and <HI>White</HI> said do not hurt him; that <HI>Montgomery</HI> discharged his piece first;
<PB N="60" REF="011683_0031_0F87C8417828B198"/>
he thinks it was about half a minute before the second gun went off; the gren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dier's gun he says was struck out of his hand by some person near him, and that he recovered it, and then fired; that <HI>Carrol</HI> was the next but one to him: he imagines Gentlemen, that <HI>Montgomery</HI> killed <HI>Attucks; Attucks</HI> was about fifteen feet from him over the gutter: He continued in his station at the corner from the time of the party's coming down till all was over; he did not ap∣prehend himself or the soldiers in danger, from clubs, sticks, snow balls, or any thing else; he saw the person that struck <HI>Montgomery</HI> as he supposed, at the corner of <HI>Royal exchange-lane</HI>; he was asked if <HI>Attucks</HI> was the person, he answered no. From this witness you ascertain, Gentlemen, that <HI>Montgomery</HI> fired first, and that he was on the right wing of the party.</P>
<P>The next witness is Mr. <HI>Palmes,</HI> he saw the Sentry, and nobody near him: He had come from <HI>Murray</HI>'s barracks, and hearing a disturbance in <HI>King-street,</HI> he was told he had better not go down, he said I will, and try to make peace; he <HI>also</HI> saw <HI>Montgomery</HI> there; the stick that struck <HI>Mont∣gomery</HI> was <HI>thrown</HI> as he apprehended; <HI>Montgomery</HI> stept back and then fired; he thinks he heard seven or eight guns, but did not count them, and it was seven or eight seconds between the first and second gun; as the last gun went off, <HI>Montgomery</HI> pushed at him with his bayonet, and he struck him with his cane, and struck the gun down; the bayonet stuck in the snow, and the gun fell out of his hand; Mr. <HI>Palmes</HI> at this time slipt and fell, but quickly recovered himself; <HI>Montgomery</HI> attempted again to push him with his bayonet, and he threw his cane at him and run; not satisfi∣ed with this, <HI>Montgomery</HI> attempted to push him a third time, and in that attempt he slipt and fell, and thereby gave <HI>Palmes</HI> an opportunity to get out of his way, or else he says he had been run through the body; from the testimony of this witness, you have further proof that <HI>Montgomery</HI> was the person who fired first; that after firing, he continued to dis∣cover marks of malice and malevolence, by pushing with his bayonet, and endeavouring to destroy not only Mr. <HI>Palmes,</HI> but all around him.</P>
<P>Next comes Mr <HI>Danbrook,</HI> he saw there <HI>Hartegan, Mont∣gomery,</HI> and <HI>Carrol.</HI> Here is another witness to three of the party; it was about a quarter after nine when he came up; he stood about ten or twelve feet from <HI>Montgomery;</HI> he saw no
<PB N="61" REF="011683_0031_0F87C8417828B198"/>
stick strke him, but a little stick he says flew over their heads, which he took to be a piece of a rattan; he was look∣ing on <HI>Montgomery</HI> when he fired; this is another evi∣dence as to the fact of firing, upon which, the witness thinks, two men sell: if that was the case, there was exe∣cution indeed; by the discharge of one gun two persons killed on the spot! He did not hear the second gun, but sup∣poses, that by one of the guns <HI>Attucks</HI> fell, he stooped to see if the Molatto was dead, then turned round and saw another man fall; <HI>Attucks</HI> at that time was near him, at his left, leaning on his stick; that circumstance I would have you keep in your minds Gentlemen, that you may remember it when you have the whole evidence together.</P>
<P><HI>Jedediah Bass</HI> is the next witness, he came up <HI>Royal ex∣change-lane</HI>; when he got into <HI>King street,</HI> he saw <HI>Montgo∣mery</HI> there: here Gentlemen is another witness as to the iden∣tity of one of the prisoners, and the witness saw him push his bayonet at a man that stood near him; he drew back into the lane, and in a minute <HI>Montgomery</HI> fired: the number of guns he took to be six, but did not count them: the people began on the firing of the first gun to run, some one way and some another. As he came up <HI>Dock square,</HI> the people were saying let us go home, there is no fire, the soldiers are gone to their barracks.</P>
<P>After this witness comes Mr. <HI>Wilkinson,</HI> who gave a very re∣gular account; he tells you he was at his own house when the bells rung for nine as usual; a little while after that he heard Dr. <HI>Cooper</HI>'s bell, on which apprehending it was for fire, he put on his surrour, and went out; he came towards the <HI>Town-House,</HI> went past it as far as the town-pump, and the people from the windows were cautioning those in the street not to go down, for they would be killed; the night was so bright that he was able where he was to see down the street as far as <HI>Boyston's alley,</HI> and there he saw a number of sol∣diers sallying out, brandishing their swords, and contending with the people; there were about thirty or forty round them with buckets and bags, thinking as he supposed that the bells rung for fire; after this he went to the <HI>Guard-house,</HI> intending to wait there, to learn if any mischief had been done at the barracks; he presently saw Capt. <HI>Preston</HI> come down, as he imagined from behind the <HI>Old Brick</HI> meeting-house, and call to the guard, and ordered them to turn out; then he saw the party come out, and saw the <HI>Captain</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="011683_0032_0F87C84588AF09A8"/>
draw his sword and march down with them; at that time there were about thirty or forty people in <HI>King street</HI>; he went a little lower, and turned back again round the north side of the <HI>Town house,</HI> and placed himself at the <HI>Royal-exchange-tavern</HI>; and the party was formed when he got there: he tells you he was not at all apprehensive of danger, conse∣quently he was capable of making observations, and placed himself in such a situation as to do it▪ the party formed in a circle, and he stood about four or five minutes, before he heard the word given to fire: that he heard it twice: on the first command they did not fire; it was repeated, and then the guns went off one after another, like the striking of a clock, he was about two yards from them and thinks the firing began at the right. This corresponds with the the testimony of several witnesses. He saw the flash of each gun seven went off, and one flashed. There Gentlemen you have evidence of all the party's firing save one: the witness was asked if he saw snow balls, ice, oyster shells, or any thing else thrown by the people, to which he answered No; he said if he had, he should have thought himself in danger, and have retreated; he heard two or three cheers before the party came down, <HI>but none afterwards.</HI> Now, Gentle∣men, if you recollect that circumstance, and the manner of his relating it, you will remember he expressed himself ve∣ry emphatically: from this testimony you have further ex∣press evidence of the fact of firing, that it came from the right, and from thence followed on to the left: he did not see the persons who were killed, therefore there is nothing in his evidence relating to that.</P>
<P>From the next witness, Mr. <HI>Simpson,</HI> you have proof of <HI>White, Wemms, Warren,</HI> and <HI>Hartegan,</HI> four of the prisoners, that they were all of the party that evening; and after re∣lating a number of minute circumstances, he swears to the discharge of eight guns, which if you give credit to his testimony, will prove to you that the whole party fired; from him you have also further evidence of the killing <HI>At∣tcks, Gray</HI> and <HI>Caldwell.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fosdick,</HI> deposes that upon his going down <HI>King-street,</HI> the first salutation he had, was the pressing of soldiers be∣hind him with the points of their bayonets, crying out, damn your blood stand out of the way! this Gentlemen, was the conduct of the party as they came down along. From Mr. <HI>Fosdick</HI> also you have evidence of their manoeuvres
<PB N="63" REF="011683_0032_0F87C84588AF09A8"/>
both before and after they formed; when the first gun was fired, the second man from the right pushed his bayonet at him, and wounded him in the breast, you saw Gentle∣men the mark in Court: before this two different men pierced him in the arm and elbow quite to the bone; here Gentlemen were three thrusts given to a person innocently passing down upon the cry of fire! he knew not as he swears to you, what was the occasion of the party's coming down. The right hand Grenadler fell after he had fired, occasioned by pushing at a person who went down <HI>Royal-exchange-lane,</HI> this probably was Mr. <HI>Palmes,</HI> in whose evidence if you re∣member, you have this circumstance related, that on his pushing at him the third time, <HI>Montgomery</HI>'s foot slipped, which gave him an opportunity to escape down the lane.</P>
<P><HI>Hemmingway,</HI> the next witness, swears, that being in com∣pany with <HI>Killroy,</HI> he beard him say he never would miss an opportunity to fire on the people of the town, for he had wanted it ever since be landed; that <HI>Killroy</HI> was not then in liquor nor appeared to be in anger; he told him he was a fool, for saying so, he said I do not care, I will not miss an opportunity for all that; these expressions Gentlemen speak for themselves, they are of such a nature as you can∣not but draw from them the temper of the man's heart who spoke them, which you will consider at your leisure.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hillier,</HI> came from the <HI>North end,</HI> was told there was no fire, but the soldiers were insulting the inhabitants; a number of people in <HI>Dock square</HI> seemed afraid to go up to <HI>King-street,</HI> another circumstance which accounts for the ap∣pearance of the inhabitants, at that time in <HI>Dock-square;</HI> the witness went up to <HI>King-street,</HI> saw the Sentry with his bayo∣net charged breast high, about twenty or thirty boys about him; he had often seen many more in that street in such a night as that was; it was bright moon light: the people on the party's coming down seemed to collect in a body in <HI>Royal-exchange-lane</HI>; as he passed the last man, he heard a gun from the right, thinks it was about twenty seconds be∣fore the second gun fired; be observed a little boy running a cross the street crying fire, and the left hand man followed the boy with his gun; there was nothing passed he observed to induce them to apprehend any danger; he says, had even the soldiers pointed at me, I should not have thought my∣self in danger; he thinks there were six guns fired; he saw no snow balls thrown, if there had been, he must have
<PB N="64" REF="011683_0033_0F87C84612D8DC10"/>
seen them. When the soldiers came down, there was a sure of shouting, and a short time after, the first gun fired. I need not dwell longer on this testimony for you must re∣member it yourselves.</P>
<P><HI>Nicholas Ferriter</HI> was next sworn, who knew <HI>Killroy</HI> and <HI>Warren</HI>; he swears to their being at the Rope-walks before this affair happened; be relates the circumstances of three several attacks in the Rope-walks, the first was a single per∣son who challenged him out to fight; a squ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble ensued, and the soldier took to his heels; he soon collected a dozen more, came again, and had a farther battle, in which the soldiers were again worsted; they then collected a large num∣ber, to the amount of thirty, and in about three-quarters of an hour they came back, and went at it again; in this last squabble the soldiers were a third time worsted. From this affair perhaps may be dated a good deal of the proceed∣ings of the Monday-evening; you have heard from the witnesses that the soldiers of that regiment, remembered the grudge, and discovered a malicious disposition; were frequently seen in parties, and when single, with arms, attacking the people passing the streets. <HI>Killroy</HI> one of the prisoners, and <HI>Warren,</HI> are expressly sworn to, that they were in this affray; <HI>Gray</HI> and <HI>Ferriter</HI> went into <HI>King-street, Gray</HI> had no stick; <HI>Ferriter</HI> left <HI>Gray</HI> in <HI>King-street</HI>; it appears he did not go down with a disposition to commit any assault at all.</P>
<P><HI>Burdick</HI> is the next witness, he says when he came down to <HI>King-street</HI> he spoke to a soldier, he thinks it was <HI>Montgo∣mery,</HI> he asked him if he was loaded and intended to fire; yes, by the eternal God! was the answer he received.— The intention of that soldier, whoever he was, you clearly discover; the witness thinks it was <HI>Montgomery</HI>; he says further, a soldier pushed at him with his bayonet, and he struck his gun; he saw nothing flung but a small stick, which hit nobody; as he was stooping to take up the dead, they cocked their guns and presented at him again; thus you see the same disposition continued, they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iming to push at every body round about them; and after they had killed these persons, they were not satisfied with that but attempted to push those that were taking them away.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> who was next sworn, hath nothing material in his testimony, but that of the guns following the peo∣ple as they ran after the first gun was fired; that seven

guns were fired, that he saw no sticks or snow balls fall near them, that all the snow balls he did see seemed to be light, and not hard.</P>
<P>It has been asked from the bench, Whether there may not be voluntary manslaughter? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>readily grant there may; it has also been observed, that homicide which includes murder, must be committed with coolness and deliberation, I allow it, and my application of this rule, is, that it comes within the evidence you have of the particular facts related by the witnesses with regard to <HI>Killroy</HI>; there is no manner of doubt with me, but the fact was done in the manner which the law calls <HI>sedato animo</HI>; he was doing a deliberate action, with a cool and calm mind; it appears, if you believe <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g∣ford,</HI> he was not molested; it appears the person he killed, and at whom he aimed, and the person whose cloths he pierced with his bayonet, were standing peaceably, one leaning on a stick, and the other with his arms folded.</P>
<P>After the witnesses we have gone through, a number of gentlemen were examined, most of whom lived in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> who have testifyed to the conduct of the soldiers, that even∣ing the affair happened.</P>
<P>I will not take them in order, for I apprehend, by recur∣ing to Colonel <HI>Marshal</HI> first, the rest will come in more na∣turally; he says, he came from Colonel <HI>Jackson</HI>'s in <HI>Dock-square,</HI> about a quarter after nine o'clock; that the street was quite still, no body passing thro' <HI>Dock square</HI>; he came up to his own house next the <HI>Custom house,</HI> he passed the Sen∣tinel, and there was no body near him; <HI>King-street</HI> was quite still, fewer people passing than he had usually seen on such a fine night; he went into his own house, and soon after heard a distant cry of murder, what part of the street it came from he did not know: He, gentlemen, you will remember, intimated also this circumstance, that he had been warned not to go out that evening; this gave him an apprehension there was some mischief to be betwixt the sol∣diers and the inhabitants; he mentioned it to the person in the strop, and went out; looking towards the <HI>Guard-house,</HI> he saw a number of soldiers issue from thence in an undress, with naked swords, cutlasses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> crying out "Damn them where are they? By Jesus let 'em come." As to the situa∣tion of the Moon, whether she was north or south, which has been much altercated, I cannot see it will make much one way or the other, it is sufficient that Colonel <HI>Marshall,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="011683_0034_0F87C846A20E23C0"/>
whose credibility and capacity will not be disputed, has sworn that from his door he observed a party of soldiers come down in undress, armed with cutlasses and other wea∣pons, the cutlasses he swears he particularly saw glittering in the Moon light; the expressions he said he plainly heard, while they were brandishing their swords; when this party passed off, he saw a second party come up <HI>Quaker-lane,</HI> arm∣ed in the same manner, and making use of the same kind of language, and that party he said cried fire; in his testi∣mony on the trial of Captain <HI>Preston,</HI> he said the bells rung on that cry; he expressed some doubt of this yesterday, but it was certainly just about that time; the use I would make of this is, to compare it with what the other witnesses say of the conduct of the soldiers in <HI>Cornhill</HI>; as Mr. <HI>Thayer</HI> ex∣presses it, it is probable the word fire was a watch-word; it appears to me, that if we can believe the evidence, they had a design of attacking and slaughtering the inhabitants that night, and they could have devised no better method to draw out the inhabitants unarmed, than to cry fire!</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thayer,</HI> was sitting at his fire, in <HI>Corn-hill,</HI> near <HI>Boylston</HI>'s <HI>alley,</HI> he heard a great noise, and went to the door, he saw seven soldiers in an undress coming down like wild creatures, with cutlasses in their hands, crying damn them, where are they? upon this he heard a cry of fire, and supposed it to be a watch-word.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Kneeland,</HI> who lives by the town-pump, came out and stood at his door; saw a number of soldiers pass by him armed; one of them came up to him and said, damn you what do you do here? and pointed his bayonet to his breast, telling him to go in.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Appleton</HI> who lived opposite, tells you he was standing by his neighbour Mr. <HI>Marsh,</HI> they were both at the door; a number of soldiers came running down, armed with cutlasses, in an undress, and they seemed to come out of their way, (observing them at the door) with uplifted weapons, intending as it appeared, to strike them: but they fortunately got into th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> doors.</P>
<P>Then gentlemen, comes the son of Mr. <HI>Appleton,</HI> the young master who was sworn yesterday, whose story, with his manner of telling it, must strike deep into your minds; I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sure it did in mine; a child of his age, with a younger brother sent of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> errand a few steps, and on returning home, struck at by a party of soldiers, nay ruffians, with
<PB N="67" REF="011683_0034_0F87C846A20E23C0"/>
cutlasses, he innocently crying, soldiers spare my life! No damn you we will kill you all, or words to that purpose, at∣tended with a blow, was the answer the little victim re∣ceived! what can indicate malice if this does not? cruelty almost equal to that of a <HI>Pharoh</HI> or <HI>Herod.</HI> I remember at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t tryal, my brother <HI>Adams</HI> made this observation, that "Man is a social creature, that his feelings, his pas∣sions, his imaginations are contagious," I am sure if in any instance it is so, here was food enough for such passi∣ons, such imaginations to feed upon.</P>
<P>But Gentlemen, as it does not immediately relate to the pri∣soners, all the use I mean to make of it is, to show you that from the conduct and appearance of the soldiery, in diffe∣rent parts of the town, the inhabitants had reason to be apprehensive they were in danger of their lives; children and parents, husbands and wives, masters and servants, had reason to tremble one for another. This apprehension, together with the ringing of the bells, collected numbers of people in different quarters, as is commonly the case when there is any appearance of fire; and the center of the town, when there is a doubt where fire is, becomes naturally the place of rendezvouz: this accounts for the number of people that were there, and for some having sticks and canes. I mention this only to take off the force of any evidence or pretence that may be made, that there was an intention of the people to assault, or as it has been expressed, swallow up the soldiers.</P>
<P>I have now gone through the evidence on the part of the Crown, in support of the charge against the prisoners, I shall make a very few observations, and leave it with the prisoners and their Council to make their defence, and Mr. <HI>Paine</HI> who is on the side of the Crown with me, to close the cause.</P>
<P>I think Gentlemen upon the whole evidence, you can, in the first place, have no doubt but that all the prisoners at the bar were of that party of soldiers, headed by Capt. <HI>Pres∣ton,</HI> who went down to the <HI>Custom-House,</HI> on the 5th. <HI>March,</HI> the evening mentioned in the indictments; that the five persons named in those indictments were killed by some or other of that party, but who they were that killed those se∣veral persons, may not be precisely ascertained, except in the case of <HI>Killroy,</HI> against whom I think you have certain evidence.</P>
<P>It is a rule of law Gentlemen, when the fact of killing is
<PB N="68" REF="011683_0035_0F87C8475D1CBA70"/>
once proved, every circumstance alleviating, excusing, or justifying, in order to extenuate the crime must be proved by the prisoners, for the law presumes the fact malicious, untill the contrary appears in evidence.</P>
<P>There is another rule I shall mention also, and that is, that it is imaterial, where there are a number of persons concerned, who gave the mortal blow, all that are present, are in the eye of the law, principals. This is a rule settled by the Judges of <HI>England</HI> upon solid argument. The ques∣tion therefore then will be, what species of homicide this is? and the decision of that question must be deferred, un∣till the defence comes out by the evidence on the other side</P>
<P>The laws of society, Gentlemen, lay a restraint on the pas∣sions of men, that no man shall be the avenger of his own cause, unless through absolute necessity, the law giving a remedy for every wrong: If a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might at any time ex∣ecute his own revenge, there would be and end of law.</P>
<P>A person cannot justify killing, if he can by any means make his escape; he should endeavour to take himself out of the way, before he kills the person attacking him.</P>
<P><HI>Here one of the Court judging it improper for the Council in o∣pening the cause to anticipate the defence, and this being determi∣ned by the whole Bench, Mr Quincy then closed, with saying.</HI></P>
<P>I was about to make some farther remarks, but it is thought by the Honourable Court improper to anticipate what may be urged on the other side. I shall therefore rest the case as it is, and doubt not but on the evidence as it now stands, the facts, as far as we have gone, against the priso∣ners at the bar, are fully proved, and until something turns up to remove from your minds, the force of that evidence, you must pronounce them <HI>GUILTY.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<HEAD>Mr. JOSIAH QUINCY. jun.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Honours, and you Gentlemen of the Jury.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE prisoners at the bar stand indicted for the murder of five of his Majesty's leige subjects, as set forth in the se∣veral indictments, which have been read to you: the per∣sons slain, those indictments set forth, as "<HI>being in the peace of God and our Lord, the King,</HI>" at the time of the mortal wounds given.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="011683_0035_0F87C8475D1CBA70"/>To these indictments, the prisoners have <HI>severally</HI> plead∣ed Not Guilty: and for their trial have put themselves on <HI>God and their country;</HI> which country you are. And by their pleas, thus <HI>severally</HI> pleaded, they are to stand or fall, by the evidence, which shall <HI>respectively</HI> apply to them.</P>
<P>By their plea of Not Guilty, they throw the burden of proof, as to the <HI>fact</HI> of <HI>killing,</HI> upon the Crown; but, upon which being proved, the matters, they allege to <HI>justify, ex∣cuse,</HI> or <HI>extenuate,</HI> must be adduced by them, and sup∣ported by legal evidence. The <HI>truth</HI> of the <HI>facts,</HI> they may thus alledge, is your sole and undoubted province to deter∣mine; but upon a supposition, that those <HI>facts</HI> shall appear to your satisfaction, in the manner we alledge, the grand question then to be determined, will be, —whether, such matters so proved, do <HI>in law extenuate, excuse,</HI> or <HI>justify.</HI> The decision of this question, belongs to another depart∣ment; namely, the Court. This is law so well known and acknowledged, that I shall not now detain you by a reci∣tal of authorities, but only refer to Judge Foster's Crown Law, where this point is treated with precision, and fixed beyond controversy. It may not be amiss; however, to as∣sure you, that as certain as the cognizance of <HI>facts</HI> is with∣in your jurisdiction, as certain does the law, resulting from <HI>these facts, in cases of the present kind,</HI> seem to reside <HI>solely</HI> in the Court: unless cases where juries, under the direction of the Court, give general verdicts, may be denominated ex∣ceptions.</P>
<P>I take it, that, in the cause now before us, it will not be contested, that five persons were unfortunately killed, at the time the indictments charge; and this ease will natu∣rally enough divide itself, into three main divisions of en∣quiry.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Whether any homicide was committed?</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. By whom was it committed?</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Is there any thing appearing in evidence, which will justify, excuse, or extenuate such homicide, by reducing it to that species of offence, called manslaughter?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Before we enter upon these enquiries, permit me, Gen∣tlemen, to remind you of the importance of this trial, as it relates to the prisoners —It is for their lives! If we con∣sider the number of persons now on trial, joined with many other circumstances which might be mentioned, it is by far the most important, this country ever saw.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="011683_0036_0F87C84980F5D598"/>Remember the ties you are under to the prisoners and e∣ven to yourselves: The eyes of all are upon you. Patience in hearing this cause is an essential requisite; candor and cau∣tion are no less essential. It is tedious and painful to at∣tend so lengthy a trial; but remember the time which has been taken up by the Crown, in the opening. By every bond of humanity and justice, we claim an equal indul∣gence: pay, it is of high importance to your country, that nothing should appear on this trial to impeach our jus∣tice, or stain our humanity.</P>
<P>And here, let me remind you of a notion, which has certainly been too prevalent, and guard you against it's baneful influence. An opinion has been entertained by many among us, that the life of <HI>a soldier,</HI> was of very lit∣tle value: of much less value, than others of the commu∣nity.—The law Gentlemen, knows no such distinction;— the life of a soldier is viewed by the equal eye of the law, as estimable, as the life of any other citizen.</P>
<P>I cannot any other way account, for what I mention, but by supposing, that the indigence and poverty of a soldier,— the toils of his life,—the severity of discipline to which he is exposed,—the precarious tenure by which he is general∣ly thought to hold his life, in the summary decisions of a court-martial, have conspired to propagate a sentiment of this kind; but a little attention to the human heart, will dissipate this notion.</P>
<P>The soldier takes his choice, like all others, of his course of life:—he has an equal right, with you or me, so to do. It is best we should not all think alike. Habit makes all things agreeable. What at first was irksome, soon becomes pleasing. But does experience teach, that misery begen in general an hatred of life. By no means; we all reluct at death;—we long for one short space more—we grasp, with anxions solicitude, even after a wretched existence. GOD and Nature has implanted this love of life.—Expel therefore from your breasts, an opinion so unwarrantable by any law, human or divine; let not any thing so injuri∣ous to the prisoners, who value life as much as you; let not any thing so repugnant to all justice have an influence is this trial. The reputation of the country depends much on your conduct, Gentlemen, and, may I not add, Justice calls aloud for candour in hearing, and impartiality in de∣ciding this cause, which has, perhaps, too much engrossed
<PB N="71" REF="011683_0036_0F87C84980F5D598"/>
our affections—and, I speak for one, too much excited our passions.</P>
<P>The law, by which the prisoners are to be tried, is a law of mercy—a law applying to us all—a law, judge <HI>Blackstone</HI> will tell us
<Q>founded in principles, that are perma∣nent, <HI>uniform</HI> and <HI>universal,</HI> always <HI>conformable</HI> to the feelings of <HI>humanity</HI> and the indelible rights of man∣kind.</Q>
Sec 4, 13. Cap. 3.</P>
<P>How ought we all, who are to bear a part in this day, to aim at a strick adherence to the principles of this law—how ought we all to aim at utterly eradicating every undue bi∣ass of the judgment—a bias subversive of all justice and hu∣manity.</P>
<P>Another opinion equally foreign to truth and law has been adopted by many.</P>
<P>It has been thought, that no possible case could happen, in which a soldier could fire, without the aid of a civil magistrate. This is a great mistake—a very unhappy mis∣take indeed!—one, I am afraid, that had it's influence, on the fatal night, which we all lament. The law, <HI>as to the present point,</HI> puts the citizen and soldier under <HI>equal</HI> re∣straint. What will justify and mitigate the action or the one, will do the same to the other.— Let us bear this in∣variable in mind, in examining the evidence. But before we proceed to this examination, let us take a transient view of some occurences, proceding and subsequent to the melan∣choly fifth of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>About some five or six years ago, it is well known, cer∣tain measures were adopted by the <HI>British</HI> parliament, which gave a general alarm to this continent. Measures were al∣ternately taken, in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> that awakened jea∣losy, resentment, fortitude and vigilance.—Affairs continu∣ed long stactuating. A sentiment universal prevailed, that our dearest rights were invaded. It is not our business here to enquire touching these delicate points. These are con∣cernments, which however interesting or important in themselves, we must keep far away from us, when in a Court of law. It poisons justice, when politics tinctures it's current.</P>
<P>I need not inform you, how the tide rose, as we were ad∣vancing towards the present times. The general atten∣tion became more and more roused people became more a like in opinion and practice. A vast majority thought all
<PB N="72" REF="011683_0037_0F87C849A4B7CF90"/>
that was dear was at stake—sentiments of liberty—proper∣ty—ignominious bondage—all conspire to encrease the fer∣ment.—At this period, the troops land.—Let us here pause, and view the citizen and soldier.</P>
<P>The causes of grievance being thus spread far and wide, the inhabitants viewed the soldiery as called in, foreign from their prime institution, to force obedience to acts, which were, in general, deemed subversive of natural, as well as constitutional freedom. With regard to the universal pre∣valence of ideas of this kind, it does not fall within our present plan, to give you direct, positive evidence. It would be too foreign to the present issue, though pertinent enough, when considered as a clue to springs and motives of action, and as an additional aid to form a just judgement in our pre∣sent enquiry. You Gentlemen who come from the body of the county, are presumed to know these facts, if they are true; nay their notoriety must be such, provided I am not mistaken in my conjecture, that the justice of my observa∣tion on this matter, must be certainly confirmed by your own experience. I presume not in this, or any other mat∣ter of fact, to prescribe to you; if these sentiments are wrong, they ought to have no influence; if right, they ought certainly to have their due weight.</P>
<P>I say, Gentlemen, and appeal to you for the truth of what I say, that many on this continent viewed their chains as already forged, they saw fetters as prepared, they be∣held the soldiers as fastening, and riveting for ages, the shackles of their bondage. With the jus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness of these ap∣prehensions, you and I have nothing to do in this place. Disquisitions of this sort, are for the Senate, and the Cham∣ber of Council—they are for statesmen and politicians who take a latitude in thoughts and actions; but we. Gen∣tlemen, are confined in our excursions, by the rigid rules of law.—Upon the <HI>real, actual</HI> existence of these apprehen∣sions, in the community, we may judge—they are <HI>facts</HI> fal∣ling properly within on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cognizance—and hitherto may we go, but no further. It is my duty, and I ought to impress it on your minds, and you, Gentlemen, ought to retain the impression—You are to determine on the facts coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your knowlege;—You are to think, judge, and act, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Jurymen,</HI> and not as <HI>Statesmen.</HI></P>
<P>Matters being thus circumstanced, what might be ex∣pected. No room was left for cordiality and friendship.
<PB N="73" REF="011683_0037_0F87C849A4B7CF90"/>
Discontent was seated on almost every brow. Instead of that hospitality, that the soldier thought himself intitled to, scorn, contempt and silent murmurs were his recepti∣on. Almost every countenance lowered with a discoutent∣ed gloom, and scarce an eye, but flashed indignant fire.</P>
<P>Turn and contemplate the camp. Do we find a more fa∣vourable appearance?</P>
<P>The soldier had his feelings, his sentiments, and his cha∣racteristick passions also. The constitution of our govern∣ment has provided a stimulus for his affections.—The pride of conscious virtue, the sense of valour, the <HI>point of honour.</HI></P>
<P>The law had taught him to think favourably of himself. Had taught him to consider himself,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Blackstone's Commentaries, Vol. I. p. 407.</NOTE> as peculiarly appoint∣ed for the safeguard and defence of his country. He had heard, that he put not off the citizen, when he entered the camp; but because he was a citizen, and wished to conti∣nue so, he made himself for a while a soldier.</P>
<P>How stinging was it to be stigmatized, as the instru∣ment of tyranny and oppression? how exasperating to be viewed, as aiding to enthrall his country? He felt his heart glow with an ardour, which <HI>he</HI> took for a love of liberty and his country, and had formed to himself no design fa∣tal to it's privileges. He recollected no doubt, that he had heretofore exposed himself for it's service. He had bared his bosom in defence of his native soil, and as yet felt the sma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of wounds received in conflict for his King and Coun∣try. Could that spirit, which had braved the shafts of fo∣reign battle, brook the keener wounds of civil contest?— The arrows which now pierced him, pierced as deep, and rankled more, than those of former times. Is it rational to imagine much harmony could long subsist?</P>
<P>We must take human nature as we find it, and not vainly imagine, that all things are to become new, at such a crisis.</P>
<P>There are an order of men in every commonwealth who never reason, but always act from feelings. That their rights and liberties were filched away one after another, they had often been told. They had been taught, by those whom they believed, that the ax was now laid to the root of the tree, and one more stroke compleated it's fall. It was in vain to expect to silence or subdue these emotions by reasons, soothings, or dangers. A belief, that nothing
<PB N="74" REF="011683_0038_0F87C84AAF7D5170"/>
could be worse than the calamities which seemed inevita∣ble, had extended itself on all sides, and arguments drawn from such sources had little influence. Each day gave rise to now occurrences which encreased animosities. Heart-burn∣ings, heats and bickerings became more and more extensive. Reciprocal insults lowered the temper, mutual injuries im∣bittered the passions.</P>
<P>Can we wonder, that when every thing tended to some important action, the period so soon arrived? Will not our wonder be encreased, to find the crisis no sooner taking place, when so many circumstances united to hasten it's ap∣proach? To use an allusion somewhat homely, may we not wonder, that the <HI>acid</HI> and the <HI>alcali,</HI> did not sooner fer∣ment?</P>
<P>A thought here imperceptibly forces itself on our minds, and we are led to be astonished, that persons so discordant in opinion, so opposite in views, attachments and con∣nections, should be stationed together. But here, Gentle∣men, <HI>we must stop.</HI> If we pursue this enquiry, at this time, and in this place, we shall be in danger of doing great in∣justice. We shall get beyond our limits. The right of quartering troops in this province must be discussed at a dif∣ferent tribunal. The <HI>constitutional</HI> legality, the propriety, the expediency of their appointment are questions of state, not to be determined, nor even agitated by us, in this Court. It is enough for us, if the law takes notice of them when thus stationed; if it warrants their continuance; If it protects them in their quarters. They were sent here by that authority, which our laws know; they were quarter∣ed here, as I take it, agreeable to an act of the British Par∣liament; they were ordered here, by your Sovereign, and mine. I expect hereafter, to be more particular on this head.</P>
<P>Let me here take a method very common, with another order of men. Let me remind you of what is <HI>not</HI> your duty.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, great pains have been taken by different men, with very different views, to involve the character, the con∣duct and reputation of the town of <HI>Boston,</HI> in the present issue. <HI>Boston</HI> and it's inhabitants have no more to do with this cause, than you or any other members of the community. You are, therefore, by no means to blend two things, so es∣sentially different, as the guilt or innocence of this town
<PB N="75" REF="011683_0038_0F87C84AAF7D5170"/>
and the prisoners, together. The inhabitants of <HI>Boston,</HI> by no rules of law▪ justice of common sense, can be supposed answerable for the unjustifiable conduct of a few individu∣als hastily assembled in the streets. Every populous city, in like circumstances, would be liable to similar commoti∣ons, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not worse. No rational or honest man, will form any worse opinion of this metropolis, for the transactions of that melancholy night. Who can, who will, unneces∣sarily interest themselves, to justify the rude behaviour of a mixt and ungovernable multitude? May I not appeal to you, and all who have heard this trial, thus far, that things already wear a different aspect from what we have been, heretofore, taught to expect? Had any one told you some weeks ago, that the evidence on the Crown-side, would have appeared in it's present light, would you have believ∣ed it? Can any one think it his duty, to espouse the part acted, by those assembled in <HI>King-street?</HI>—I think not, but lest my opinion should not have any weight, let me remind you of an author, whom, I trust, and wish in the hands of all of you. One whom I trust you will credit. I am sure you ought to love and rev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re him. I wish his sentiments were ingraven in indelible characters on your hearts. You will not suspect him of being unfriendly to liberty; if this cause and it's event must, at all hazards, be held as interwo∣ven with a matter so foreign to it. I allude to the third Letter of the FARMER of <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> to his countrymen.</P>
<P><Q>The cause of liberty, says, that great and good wri∣ter, is a cause of too much dignity, to be fullied by tur∣bulence and tumult. It ought to be maintained in a man∣ner suitable to her nature. Those who engage in it, should breathe a <HI>sedate,</HI> yet <HI>fervent spirit,</HI> animating them to actions of <HI>prudence, justice, modesty, bravery, humanity,</HI> and magnanimity.</Q></P>
<P>What has there transpired on this trial, savouring of any of these virtues? Was it <HI>justice</HI> or <HI>humanity</HI> to attack, in∣sult, ridicule and abuse a <HI>single</HI> Sentinel on his post? Was it either <HI>modest, brave</HI> or <HI>magnanimous</HI> to rush upon the points of fixed bayonets; and trifle, vapour, and provoke at the very mouths of loaded muskets. It may be brutal rage, or wanton rashness, but not surely any true magna∣nimity.</P>
<P><Q>I hope, says the same eminent writer, my dear country∣men, that you will in every colony be upon your <HI>guard
<PB N="76" REF="011683_0039_0F87C84B1C5B9908"/>
against those,</HI> who AT ANY TIME endeavour to stir you up, under <HI>pretences of patriotism,</HI> to <HI>any</HI> measures DISRE∣SPECTFUL to <HI>your Sovereign</HI> and our <HI>mother country</HI></Q></P>
<P>By this it should seem, as though the Farmer never ex∣pected <HI>any period</HI> would arrive, when <HI>such measures</HI> would be warrantable. Now what more <HI>disrespectful</HI> to our <HI>parent</HI> country, than to treat with contempt a body of men stati∣oned most certainly by the consent of <HI>her</HI> supreme legisla∣tive, the parliament of <HI>Britain</HI>? What more <HI>disrespectful</HI> of <HI>our common sovereign,</HI> than to assume the sword of justice, and become the avengers of either public or private wrongs? Tho' the soldiers, who appeared in the earlier part of the evening, in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> acted like barbarians and savages, they had now retired, and were now confined in their barracks: what tho' an impertinent boy had received unjustifiable cor∣rection from the Sentinel; the boy, and the persons in <HI>Corn∣hill,</HI> must have recourse only to the law for their redress. Courts of law are stiled "<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>indices injuriarum,</HI>" the avengers of injuries, and none others are to assume this prerogative. The law erects itself as the supreme, dernier resort, in all complaints of wrongs; and nothing could more essentially s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p our most important interests, than any countenance to such dangerous encroachments on the domains of munici∣pal justice.</P>
<P>But finally, to finish with the justly celebrated Farmer—
<Q><HI>Hot, rash, disorderly</HI> proceedings, <HI>injure</HI> the reputation of a people as to <HI>wisdom, valour,</HI> and <HI>virtue,</HI> without procur∣ing the <HI>least benefit.</HI></Q>
Thus have you the sense of this great authority <HI>with us.</HI> And let me ask all those, who have thought the cause of their country connected with the agents of the assembly in <HI>King-street,</HI> whether the <HI>proceedings</HI> of that unhappy night, were <HI>hot, rash,</HI> or <HI>disorderly?</HI> If they were, have they not, in the opinion of this great friend of liber∣ty, <HI>injured</HI> our reputation, as to <HI>wisdom, valour,</HI> and <HI>virtue</HI>; and that too, without procuring the <HI>least</HI> benefit? Who then would sacrifice his judgment and his integrity, to vin∣dicate <HI>such</HI> proceedings?</P>
<P>To what purposes the soldiers were sent; whether it was a step warranted by sound policy or not, we shall not enquire; we are to consider the troops, not as the instru∣ments for wresting our rights, but as fellow citizens, who being to be tried by a law, extending to every individual, claim a part in it's benefits—it's privileges—it's mercy. We
<PB N="77" REF="011683_0039_0F87C84B1C5B9908"/>
must steel ourselves against passions, which contaminate the fountain of justice. We ought to recollect, that our present decisions will be scann'd, perhaps thro' all Europe. We must not forget, that we ourselves will have a reflective hour—an hour, in which we shall view things through a different medium—when the pulse will no longer beat with the tumults of the day—when the conscious pang of having betrayed truth, justice, and integrity, shall bite like a serpent and sting like an adder.</P>
<P>Consider, Gentlemen, the danger which you, and all of us are in, of being led away by our affections and attach∣ments.—We have seen the blood of our fellow men flow∣ing in the streets. We have been told that this blood was <HI>wrongfully</HI> shed. That is now the point in issue. But let it be borne deep upon our minds, that the prisoners are to be condemned by the evidence <HI>here in Court</HI> produced against them, and by nothing else. Matters heard or seen abroad, are to have no weight: in general they undermine the pil∣lars of justice and truth. It has been our misfortune, that a system of evidence has appeared in the world against us. It is not our business to blame any one for this. It is our misfortune, I say. It should be remembered, that we were not present to cross examine: and the danger which results from having this publication in the hands of those who are to pass upon our lives, ought to be guarded against. We say we are innocent, by our plea, and are not to be de∣nounced guilty upon a new species of evidence, unknown in the <HI>English</HI> system of criminal law.</P>
<P>But as though a series of <HI>ex parte</HI> evidence was not enough, all the colours of the canvass have been touched in order to freshen the wounds, and by a transport of imagination, we are made present at the scene of action. The prints ex∣hibited in our houses have added wings to fancy, and in the fervour of our zeal, reason is in hazard of being lost. For as was elegantly expressed, by a learned Gentleman at the late trial, "The passions of man, nay his very imaginations are contagious." The pomp of funeral, the horrors of death have been so delineated, as to give a spring to our ideas, and inspire a glow incompatible with sound, deli∣berative judgment. In this situation, every passion has alternately been predominant. They have each in it's turn, subsided, in degree, and they have sometimes given place to despondence, grief and sorrow. How careful should
<PB N="78" REF="011683_0040_0F87C84E940F0A50"/>
we be, that we do not mistake the impressions of gloom and melancholy, for the dictates of reason and truth. How careful, lest borne away by a torrent of passion, we make ship∣wreck of conscience.</P>
<P>Perhaps, you may be told. Gentlemen, as I remember it was said, at the late trial, that passions were like the flux and restux of the sea—the highest tides always producing the lowest ebbs. But let it be noticed, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de, in our political ocean, has yet never turned; certainly the cur∣rent has never set towards the opposite quarter. However similies may illustrate, they never go for proof. —Though I believe, that it will be found, that if the tide of resent∣ment has <HI>not</HI> risen of late, it has been because, it had reach∣ed the summit.—In the same mode of phraseology, if so homely an expression may be used; perhaps, as the seam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n say, it has been high-water slack—but I am satisfied the current has not as yet altered it's course, in favour of the prisoners at the bar.</P>
<P>Many things yet exist sufficient to keep alive the glow of indignation. I have aimed at securing you against the catching flame. I have endeavoured to discharge my duty, in this respect:—What success will follow those endeavours, depends on you, Gentlemen. If being told of your dan∣ger will not produce caution, nothing will. If you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e de∣termined in opinion, it is in vain to say more, but if you are zealous enquirers after truth; if you are willing to hear with impartiality—to examine and judge for yourselves— enough has been said to apprize you of those avenues, at which the enemies of truth and justice are most likely to enter—and most easily to beset you.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>I shall now, <HI>for argument's sake only,</HI> take it for granted, that <HI>the fact of killing,</HI> had been proved upon all the prison∣ers: you are sensible this is not really true; for as to this point, there are several of the prisoners upon whom this <HI>fact</HI> is not fixed. But as I shall hereafter take occasion to consider the distinct case of each prisoner, as he is affected by the evidence, I at present chuse to avoid confusion, and apply myself to the full strength of the crown; and, upon a supposition, that <HI>all</HI> the prisoners were answerable for <HI>the act</HI> of <HI>any</HI> one, see how the prisoners are chargeable, by the evidence already offered, with the crime of <HI>Murder:</HI>—or rather endeavour to point out to you those facts, appear∣ing
<PB N="79" REF="011683_0040_0F87C84E940F0A50"/>
by the evidence on the crown side, which will amount, in law, to a <HI>justification,</HI> an excuse, or, at least, an extenu∣ation of their offence.—For we say, that give the evidence for the king it's full scope and force, and our offence is re∣duced, at least, to Manslaughter: in which case, we claim the privilege of that law, by the sentence of which, if guilty, we must suffer the pains of death:—a privilege we can never again claim—a privilege, that by no means im∣plies exemption from all punishment: the offender becomes liable to imprisonment, for a year—incurs a forfeiture of all goods and chattels; and, till he receives the judgment of law, is to all intents a felon—subject to all the disabili∣ties and other incidents of a selon. Without taking up time, in attending and discussing points, no way pertinent to the present issue; without a tedious recapitulation of cir∣cumstances, with which, I take it, we have no more con∣cern, than either of you, Gentlemen; I say passing over all these matters as foreign to <HI>this</HI> trial:—let us state evi∣dence appearing even from the crown witnesses.</P>
<P>These witnesses, (whose testimony I shall not consider in the order they were produced) inform you, that in the former part of the evening a number of soldiers rushed from some of the lanes near the <HI>Guard house,</HI> or as Col. <HI>Mar∣shall</HI> supposes, from the <HI>Guard house</HI> itself. But some circum∣stances he relates, as to their dress, may render it doubtful, whether he is right in this point. Soldiers on guard have a peculiar regimental habiliment, which they never dare put off; and if I am rightly instructed, no soldiers, but those on duty, are suffered to be at the <HI>Guard-house</HI> at those hours. However thus much is certain, that being dressed in short jackets or working coa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, proves them not to be of that particular party who had mounted guard at this time.</P>
<P>The cry was "where are they—damn them where are they!" They brandish their weapons, and proceed to <HI>Corn-hill.</HI> What those weapons were the witnesses say differently. But it should be mentioned, as we go along, that the soldiers of the twenty-ninth, are never allowed to wear swords or cutlasses.</P>
<P>As these soldiers pass down <HI>Corn-hill,</HI> they assualt, abuse and attack people. The soldiers in their turn are beaten. One has his wrist broke—and the general cry soon after was— "they are beaten—they are drove into the barracks!"</P>
<P>Some part of this conduct may hereafter be accounted for,
<PB N="80" REF="011683_0041_0F87C84F0F03BC18"/>
and other parts of it may stand in a very different light. But we are ready to admit, that their behaviour was alto∣gether unjustifiable—for we don't look upon ourselves as a∣ny way concerned in their conduct.—Conduct which, if some of the witnesses are not mistaken, seems more like that of madmen and barbarians, than like reasonable creatures. If <HI>they</HI> acted like savages or ruffians, what is that to <HI>us?</HI> This evidence, therefore not applying to this case, we are injur∣ed if it has any influence to our prejudice. Being foreign to the issue, we humbly conceive it ought never to have been introduced;—or being introduced, it ought to be re∣jected, in our determining the guilt or innocence of the prisoners.</P>
<P>☞ Mr. <HI>Josiah Quincy</HI> then proceeded to a minute detail of the crown evidence, pointing out, as he went along, those circumstances that favoured the prisoners; and com∣menting chiefly on those facts, which served to refute or in∣validate the positions of the Council for the Crown; by showing an assult and attack upon <HI>the Sentry.</HI> He then re∣viewed those parts of the evidence, which had a tendency either to prove insult, abuse, or assault and battery of <HI>the party</HI>: he pointed out the various quarters, from which all these, but especially the assault and battery proceeded: and from the facts, time and circumstances testified, inferred the attack to have been on various sides at the same instant. From the noises, violence and rattling of the guns he drew other consequences useful to his cause. From the inatten∣tion of some, and the forgetfulness of others; from the tumult, fright, confusion and passions in the scene, he made such deductions as might account for the contrariety and seeming incompatibility of the evidence.</P>
<P>He next very particularly stated the Evidence for the prisoners, as he had been instructed it would turn out on ex∣amination; and as he opened his evidence, he carefully re∣marked its conformity to, and connection with, many parts of that already exhibited by the Council for the King.— He then called the witnesses, who swore as follow.]</P>

<P>I am the person that came up stairs and told the witness examined before me, that there was a disturbance in the street. The whole I have to say is this.—Coming home that evening from a friends house in <HI>Fore-street,</HI> I called at a house in <HI>Union street.</HI> Turning the corner of <HI>Fore-street,</HI> I heard a noise which drew my attention immediately, it seem∣ed to come from the <HI>Post-Office,</HI> or thereabouts: Immediate∣ly I went to see what the matter was. At the bottom of <HI>Roy∣al-exchange lane,</HI> I asked a man that was at a distance what the matter was? He said it was a squabble betwixt the inhabitants and soldiers; I then stood at the bottom of the lane, I had not stood long there, till I was obliged to go away, the party, engaged with the soldiers, having been routed as I thought, came rushing down towards where I stood. I went into Mr. <HI>Hunter</HI>'s, found some gentlemen there; I told them they were very q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> indeed, considering these was such a num∣ber of people in the street. We went into the balcony and stood there, to see the transactions below; and the only thing material I can recollect, that passed, was this: I saw a pret∣ty large number of people assembled together, drawn to∣gether, I apprehended, by the noise of them that were first engaged with the soldiers. It was proposed by severals of them, to call out fire!—Fire was called several times, and then the bells were set a ringing. This drew a great concourse of people, not knowing but it was fire.—The greatest part had sticks of various sorts; they made several attempts to get up a lane leading to <HI>Murray</HI>'s barracks, but I suppose meeting with opposition there, they came down as if they had been pursued. After making several such attempts, they assembled in various little knots, with vari∣ous leaders, I suppose every party had a leader.

I found the num∣bers were encreasing, and, while I was standing there, two men without hats on, came up to the <HI>Main Guard,</HI> and said, you must send assistance directly, or the Sentry will be murdered, the officer I observed was quite a young offi∣cer, and there were a number of soldiers standing with their watch coats on, whether they or any soldiers went in∣to the <HI>Main-Guard</HI> I cannot say, I heard very soon the word given, "<HI>Guard,</HI>" and bid take off their watch coats; there came out about seven, I think their guns were not shoulder∣ed, but they had them in their right hands, walked across the street, and took their stand near the Sentry-box, but whether in a half-moon or circle I cannot tell, the people crouded round them, I heard a great deal of confused no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, a general confusion of noises, and there I stood till the guns were fired.</P>

A gentleman soon after came in and said there is something bad in the street, you had as good go and see what it is, three of the company went to the balcony, I went to the window fronting the street. I saw considerable numbers of people coming from the <HI>North-end,</HI>

all armed, or the greatest part of them, in the same manner, with white sticks. They made attacks on the bar∣racks, and were always drove back; always as a new fresh party came from the north part of the town, they made a new attack, there were about five or six different attacks made. In the middle of the street I saw a large man, with a red cloak and white wigg, they gathered round him, and he spoke two or three minutes, and they gave some different cheers for the <HI>Main-guard,</HI> and I think for the <HI>Nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>; they said they would do for the soldiers; when they turned round that corner where the stone store is, they beat the stone with their weapons, and said they would do for the soldi∣ers.

Numbers enquiring where the fire was; they gathered in a large body; some went up by way of the <HI>Post-office,</HI> some went up the lane by the pump, and some came down forcibly as if chased: they whistled through their fingers and cried fire: Among the rest I observed a Gentleman with a red cloack and white wigg, the croud gathered round

Somebody came
<PB N="90" REF="011683_0046_0F87C8539252AC80"/>
in and said there was fire, Mr. <HI>Fleeming</HI> said he would send his man to see where the fire was, and desired us not to be un∣easy, for he had heard it was only to gather people to fight the soldiers, or to this effect: I was uneasy however, and came away to go home. I met a good many people with sticks, and bags, and some other things. I met Mr. <HI>Fleem∣ing</HI>'s man coming back, and he said it was no fire, but the soldiers and inhabitants fighting: I saw two engines, and the people putting their buckets and bags in people's houses. I enquired where the fire was; I got the same answer, no fire, but the soldiers and inhabitants fighting. I heard some say come let us go back, others, said no by God we will go and help them. I saw Mr. <HI>Knight</HI> standing at his own door, I stopt but very little time, left him and came to the head of <HI>King-street.</HI> I heard somebody say damn them why do not they break the glass.

I run to the door, when I came there, the people were pass∣ing pretty thick, some with buckets, some with bags, and numbers with sticks and clubs; they said there was no fire, but some disturbance with the soldiers and inhabitants; I returned into the room sometime, but feeling uneasy, I went to the door again, and saw several companies of peo∣ple pass, six or eight in a company; one company consisting of eight or ten, had white sticks or clubs in their hands; one of them hallowed out, damn their bloods lets go and attack the <HI>Main guard,</HI> and knock them to hell first.

<P>On the evening of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> I was at Mr. <HI>Mars∣tons,</HI> several of us were standing by the fire: we heard the cry of fire, some said we will go out and see where the fire is. I went and I saw several people running to and fro, I asked what the matter was, they said a soldier had killed a boy. I was answered in that manner by another; some people said we will go back again and get our sticks: I did not see any number of people, but a few running up to <HI>King-street,</HI> one of them struck the ground with his stick and shivered it. I then went into <HI>King street</HI> and was coming away again, when I heard a huzza and a number of feet behind me, and I stood to let them pass; there might be about ninety; they run up <HI>King-street</HI> huzzaing. I walk∣ed after them, when they came opposite the <HI>Custom house,</HI> they stopped, and some said that is the fellow that used the inhabitants ill; another contradicted them and said it was

not him; upon that the people encroached on the Sentinel; I was in the midst of the people, and he retreated back and they went forward, at last I saw him go on the steps of the <HI>Custom house,</HI> and they went closer, and he set his back to the door and loaded.

I went about fifteen yards below, there was a man standing by me, he had the butt end of a bat in his hand, and said he would throw it at the Sentinel, I said do not, for he will fire at whatever place it comes from. Whether he threw it or not I do not know, for I left him and went to Mr. <HI>Sherwin's</HI> door. I was saying it was imprudent to attack a Sentinel on his post, somebody said he was disarmed; I thought so too, for I saw the glittering of arms; I walked to the <HI>Custom house</HI> steps, curiosity led me to see if they were so prudent as to fasten the <HI>Custom-house</HI> door; I tryed the latch, and it was fast; a fellow said to one of the soldiers, damn you why do you turn your bayonet this way, turn it the other way. I thought I was not safe there, but went to my old place, and stood there a few minutes; I thought I heard two guns cock, immediately I heard one go off, soon after another, and I think four more. I think six in all. The people said where I was standing, they fired nothing but powder. I thought to go up to an acquaintance's house, and went in the middle of the street, and coming opposite to the soldiers, I saw two men lay, one on the right and one on the left, on their backs; I concluded they were dead.</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I live opposite the barrack-house, and was at home that evening. A little after eight I heard a noise and dis∣turbance in the street, I went out to know what it was, and was told there was a difference between the towns people and soldiers. I saw several soldiers pass and repass, some with bayonets, some with clubs and one thing and another. I stood at my own door; I observed the noise seemed to come from towards the market; I saw a number of people running to and fro across the bottom of the street. I shut my door and went in about eight or ten minutes. I heard a noise like a single person running thro' <HI>Boylston</HI>'s <HI>alley</HI> with great violence; he ran as I took it towards the barrack gate, and cried out, town born turn out, town born turn out, then turned to the side of the lane, and said town born turn out, town born turn out. I heard this repeated twen∣ty or thirty times, I believe, it was the constant cry. I re∣member after coming out the second time, to hear the voice of a person which I took to be Ensign <HI>Maul,</HI> say, who is this fellow, lay hold of him. I did not hear a word pass be∣twixt the people that passed backwards and forwards, and the Sentinel at the barrack gate, nor from the Sentinel to them; this cry of town born turn out, was repeated for seven or eight mintes, when I heard the voice of a great many more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q</SPEAKER>
<P>Were they soldiers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know, they might be soldiers; from the first of that cry it might be a quarter of an hour or more, they seemed to retreat and come on again, and struck their sticks very hard against the corner of the house. The collection of such a number, with the noise of the clubs, induced me to lock my door, put out my light in the fore part of my house, and to go up stairs into the chamber fronting the barracks; when there, I observed four or five officers of the 29th, standing on their own steps, and there might be be∣twixt twenty or thirty of the town's people surrounding the steps. About that time came a little man, who he was I do not know; he said, why do you not keep your soldiers in their barracks, they said they had done every thing they possibly could, and would do every thing in their power,
<PB N="94" REF="011683_0048_0F87C858B834AC00"/>
to keep them in their barracks, on which he said, are the inhabitants to be knocked down in the street, are they to be murdered in this manner; the officers still insisted they had done their utmost, and would do it, to keep the soldi∣ers in their barracks; the same person then said, you know the country has been used ill, you know the town has been used ill, we did not send for you, we will not have you here, we will get rid of you, or we will drive you away; which of the last expressions I cannot say, but it was one or the other: the officers still insisted they had done their ut∣most, and would do it, to keep the soldiers in their barracks, and begged the person to use his interest to disperse the people, that no mischief might happen; whether he did address the people or not, I cannot say, for the confusion was so great I could not distinguish.</P>

<P>How was that man dressed?</P>

<P>He was a little man, I think in a surtout; immedi∣ately the cry of home, home, was mentioned; I dont re∣collect seeing any person go away at the first cry, and there was such confusion I could not tell what was said, but in five minutes afterwards the cry home, home, was repeated, on which the greatest part of them, possibly two thirds, went up <HI>Boylston</HI>'s <HI>alley</HI> towards the <HI>Town-house,</HI> huzzaing for the <HI>Main Guard,</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>What number were there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>A considerable number. I then observed more of the towns people come from towards the <HI>Market</HI>; there was a good deal of squabble and noise betwixt the people and the officers, but what was said I could not bear. The next thing I recollect in the affair was, a little boy came down the alley, clapping his hand to his head, and cried he was killed, he was killed; on which one of the officers took hold of him, and damned him for a little rascal, asking him what business he had out of doors; the boy seemed to be a∣bout seven or eight year old. Some little time after that, I saw a soldier come out of the barrack gate with his mus∣ket, he went directly facing the alley, in the middle of the street, and kneeled down on one knee, and said now damn your bloods, I will make a lane through you all; while he was presenting, Mr. <HI>Maul</HI> an Ensign, with either Mr. <HI>Dixon</HI> or Mr. <HI>Minchin,</HI> I do not know which, came after him, im∣mediately laid hold of him, and took the musket from him, shoved him towards the barrack, and I think gave him the
<PB N="95" REF="011683_0048_0F87C858B834AC00"/>
musket again, and charged him at his peril to come out a∣gain. I do not recollect any discourse that passed between the towns people and officers, there was still such clamour and confusion, that I could not hear what passed; but in a little time either the soldier who came out before, or ano∣ther, came out again, he repeated much the same words as the other, he had his gun in his hand, he did not offer to kneel down, but used the same expressions.</P>

<P>He was presenting when Mr. <HI>Maul</HI> knocked him down, took his muskuet from him, drove him into the ba∣racks, and I think the barrack gate was then shut; about this time I recollect I heard Dr. <HI>Cooper</HI>'s bell ring, I heard some officer say, go and stop that bell from ringing, whe∣ther any body went or not, I cannot say, but it did not ring a great while: About this time I saw Capt. <HI>Goldfinch</HI> of the fourteenth, on the steps with the officers of the twenty-ninth; there came up another little man, who he was I do not know, but in a much different manner from what the other did.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had on a great coat or surtout of a light brown, he requested the soldiers might be kept in their barracks, and that the officers would do every thing in their power to keep them there, the officers said, they had, and would do so; and as the soldiers were in their barracks, begged the people might go away; this little man said to the peo∣ple, gentlemen, you hear what the officers say, that the soldiers are all in their barracks, and you had better go home; on which the cry was, home, home, home.</P>

<P>Do you suppose this was after you heard the bell ring?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: on which a great many went up the alley a∣gain, and I heard the expression, Let us go to the <HI>Main-Guard</HI>: Capt. <HI>Goldfinch</HI> was still on the steps, and I heard his voice still talking, and I think he desired every person would go away; while he was talking, I heard the report of a musket.</P>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>How long was that after the cry of home, home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was not many minutes; in a few seconds I heard the report of a second gun, presently after that a third; upon the firing of the first gun, I heard Capt. <HI>Goldfinch</HI> say, I thought it would come to this, it is time for me to go.— I then saw a soldier come down the alley from <HI>Cornhill,</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="011683_0049_0F87C85A9BFB7F78"/>
and went up to the steps where the officers stood, and said, they fired from or upon the <HI>Main guard.</HI> I then heard the drum at the <HI>Main-Guard</HI> beat to arms, I came down stairs and did not go out till I was sent for to some of the wound∣ed people.</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, about two hours before his death, I asked him concerning the affair, he went he said up the lane, and just as he got to the corner, he heard a gun, he did not retreat back, but went to the <HI>Town-House,</HI> as he was going along, he was shot: It seems strange by the direction of the ball, how he could be killed by the firing at the <HI>Custom-House</HI>; it wounded a portion of the liver, stomach and intestines, and lodged betwixt the lower ribs, where I cut it out, the ball must have struck some wall or something else, before it struck him.</P>

<P>The 5th of <HI>March,</HI> about nine in the evening, I was passing over <HI>Cornhill,</HI> I saw a number collected by the pas∣sage to the barracks, I went towards it and two or three people called me by name, and begged me to endeavour to send the soldiers to their barracks, or else there would be murder, with difficulty I got to the entrance of the pas∣sage, the people were pelting the soldiers with snow-balls, the soldiers were defending themselves at the entrance.</P>

I saw some officers of the twenty-ninth, I told those officers I suspected there would be a riot, and as I was the oldest of∣ficer I ordered the men to the barracks, and they were im∣mediately confined; the mob followed me and came to the gate of the barracks, and abused the men very much indeed, with bad language, so that the men must have been enraged very much, but by the vigilence and activity of the officers, the men were kept within bounds; the mob still insulted the men, dared them to come out, called them a pack of scoundrels, that dared not come out to fight them, and it was with difficulty they were kept in their bar∣racks, I never heard such abuse in my life, from one man to another. A little man came up and spoke to the people, and desired them to go home, as they saw the officers used their best endeavours to keep the men in their barracks; immediately the best part made towards the passage to <HI>Corn∣hill,</HI> I suppose a body of about forty or fifty people. I thought it necessary to stay some time to assist the officers in keeping the men in their barracks, in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes after the people had moved off, I heard some guns fire, and the <HI>Main-Guard</HI> drum beat to arms; I told Mr. <HI>Dixon</HI> it was necessary for me to move off, to join my own regiment. The same evening, about half an hour before this affair happened, I was in <HI>King-street,</HI> and was accosted by a barber's boy, who said, there goes the fellow who hath not paid my master for dressing his hair, fortu∣nately for me, I had his receipt in my pocket, the Sentinel said, he is a gentleman, and if he owes you any thing he will pay it: I passed on without taking any notice of what the boy said.</P>

<P>I came out of the <HI>Green Dragon</HI> tavern about nine o'clock, I went up to <HI>King-street,</HI> I heard no noise, nor saw any person, I went through <HI>Quaker lane</HI> into <HI>Green</HI>'s <HI>lane,</HI> had a person with me hand in hand, I met about fifteen persons walking on different sides of the street, and they had sticks in their hands.</P>

<P>They seemed to be pretty large sticks, rather too large for walking-sticks, just as they passed, I turned about and heard them say, we are rather too soon, I passed on and went on board a vessel at <HI>Grissin</HI>'s wharf, when I came on board, I said to the people, I believed there would be mischief that night, for I had met several people armed with sticks, and what the consequences would be I did not know, for they seemed to be after something; just as I spoke, we heard the bells ring, and some said it could not be the usual bell for nine o'clock, they had heard that ring before, they all went on deck, and hearing a noise and cry of fire, together with the bells, every person went off and left me alone.</P>

I went to the top of the house but could see no fire; hearing by this time several bells ring, I came down and found the family at the gate; I asked what the matter was, I was answered, there was a riot in <HI>King-street.</HI> I saw several men pass, not in a body, but in two's and sin∣gly; they walked faster than people generally do on busi∣ness, they went up <HI>Hogg-lane</HI>; I observed that not a man passed but what had either a club, sword, hanger, cutlass, or gun; as I had reason to believe people in a military cha∣racter were not agreable, I went in and ordered my servant not to go out. I went a second time to the gate, and saw more men passing by in the same manner as before; pre∣sently after that, I heard the report of several guns. I heard the drum beat to arms, which I knew to be customary when a riot happens, but as the drum come nearer, I discovered a peculiarity in the beating, which made me imagine it was not a regular drum.

I went to the <HI>Town-house,</HI> saw the Sentinels pla∣ced at the <HI>Main-Guard</HI> standing by Mr. <HI>Bowes</HI>'s corner; numbers of boys on the other side of the way were throwing snow balls at them; the Sentinels were enraged and swear∣ing at the boys; the boys called them lobsters, bloody backs, and hallowed who buys lobsters; one of my acquaintance came and told me that the soldiers had been fighting, and the people had drove them to <HI>Murray</HI>'s barracks; I saw a number of people coming from <HI>Murray</HI>'s barracks who went down by <HI>Jackson's</HI> corner into <HI>King-street</HI>; presently I heard three cheers given in <HI>King-street,</HI> I said we had better go down and see what's the matter; we went down to the Whipping-post and stood by <HI>Waldo</HI>'s shop, I saw a number of people round the Sentinel at the <HI>Custom house,</HI> there were also a number of people who stood where I did, and were picking up pieces of sea coal that had been thrown out thereabout, and snow balls, and throwing them over at the Sentinel. While I was standing there, there were two or three boys run-out from among the people, and cried we have got his gun away; and now we will have him; presently I heard three cheers given by the people at the <HI>Custom house</HI>; I said to my acquaintance I would run up and see whether the guard would turn out. I passed round the <HI>Guard house,</HI> and went as far as the west door of the <HI>Town-house.</HI> While I stood there one of my acquaintance said he would go round the corner of the <HI>Town-house,</HI> and see if the guard had turned out; he went to the corner and called me, and told me the guard was come out. I went and looked down the street, I saw a file of men, with an officer with a laced hat on before them; upon that we all went to go towards him, and when we had got about half way to them, the officer said something to them, and they filed off down the street: upon that I went in the shade towards the <HI>Guard-house,</HI> and followed them down as far as Mr. <HI>Peck</HI>'s corner; I saw them
<PB N="113" REF="011683_0057_0F87C7E1670ADB98"/>
pass through the croud, and plant themselves by the <HI>Cus∣tom house.</HI> As soon as they got there the people gave three cheers. I went to cross over to where the soldiers were, and as soon as I got a glimpse of them, I heard somebody huzza and say here is Old-<HI>Murray</HI> with the riot-act, and they be∣gan to pelt show balls; a man set out and run, and I follow∣ed him as far as <HI>Philips</HI>'s corner, and I do not know where he went. I turned back and went through the people un∣til I got to the head of <HI>Royal-exchange-lane,</HI> right against the soldiers; the first word I heard was a Grenadier say to a man by me, Damn you stand back.</P>

<P>How near was he to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was so near that the Grenadler might have run him through if he had stept one step forward. While I stopt to look at him, a person came to get through betwixt the Grenadier and me, and the soldier had like to have pricked him; he turned about and said, You damn'd lobster, bloody back, are you going to stab me, the soldier said by God will I; presently somebody took hold of me by the shoulder, and told me to go home; or I should be hurt; at the same time there were a number of people towards the <HI>Town-house,</HI> who said, come away and let the guard alone, you have nothing at all to do with them. I turned about and saw the officer standing before the men, and one or two persons engaged in talk with him. A number were jumping on the backs of those that were talking with the officer, to get as near as they could.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you hear what they said?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. Upon this I went to, go as close to the officer as I could; one of the persons who was talking with the offi∣cer turned about quick to the people, and said, Damn him he is going to fire; upon that they gave a shout, and cryed out Fire and be damn'd, who ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, damn you, you dare not fire, and began to throw snow balls, and other things, which then flew pretty thick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did they hit any of them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I saw two or three of them hit, one struck a Gre∣nadier on the hat, and the people who were right before them had sticks; and as the soldiers were pushing with their guns back and forth, they struck their guns, and one hit a Grenadier on the fingers. At this time, the people up at the <HI>Town-house</HI> called again come away, come way; a stout man who stood near me, and right before the Grena∣diers,
<PB N="114" REF="011683_0058_0F87C7E32E939968"/>
as they pushed with their bayonets the length of their arms, kept striking on their guns. The people seemed to be leaving the soldiers, and to turn from them, when there came down a number from <HI>Jackson</HI>'s corner, huzzaing and crying, Damn them they dare not fire, we are not afraid of them; one of these people, a stout man with a long cord wood stick, threw himself in, and made a blow at the offi∣cer; I saw the officer try to send off the stroke, whether he struck him or not I do not know: the stout man then turn∣ed round, and struck the Grenadier's gun at the <HI>Captain</HI>'s right hand, and immediately fell in with his club, and knocked his gun away, and struck him over the head, the blow came either on the soldiers cheek or hat. This stout man held the bayonet with his left hand, and twitched it and cried kill the dogs, knock them over; this was the ge∣neral cry; the people then crouded in, and upon that the Grenadier gave a twitch back and relieved his gun, and he up with it and began to pay away on the people. I was then betwixt the officer and this grenadier, I turned to go off, when I had got away about the length of a gun, I turned to look towards the officer; and I heard the word fire; at the word fire I thought I heard the report of a gun, and upon my hearing the report, I saw the same grenadier swing his gun, and immediately he discharged it.</P>

I asked them what had been the matter, they said there had been a squabble by <HI>Murray's</HI> barracks, and they had drove the soldiers in; they said it was all over; then I left Mr. <HI>Bayard</HI> and they all came down into <HI>King-street,</HI> and betwixt <HI>Quaker-lane</HI> and <HI>Royal-exchange-lane</HI> they made a stop, and met in a eluster, and not long afterwards dis∣persed; I did not leave above twelve or fifteen in <HI>King-street,</HI> when I came out of it.

<P>On the evening of the 5th of <HI>March,</HI> I passed my time at the Bunch of Grapes in <HI>King-street,</HI> in company with three gentlemen of the town; betwixt the hours of nine and ten we were alarmed with the bells, and a cry of fire, they said to me come <HI>Gridley</HI> we had better go and enquire where the fire is, I said I had rather sit where I was, there might be some disturbance, and I did not want to be in it; however, I agreed, and we went. I saw Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> particularly, he said to me what do you make of this, I told him I believed there was no fire, but rather a tumult. I said to Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> I will go up the street and see what the matter is, and re∣turn again and let him and the rest that were on the steps of the door know what the matter was. I went up the street into the middle of it, and I stopt just before the Sen∣tinel placed at the <HI>Custom House,</HI> there were a large number of boys, and some men amongst them, about ten young men, the boys were in the front, and the men in the rear; I believe about twenty five, boys men and all.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was retreating towards the steps with his bayonet charged. I then found the <HI>Main-guard</HI> to be in confusion. I went up to the head of the <HI>Town-house,</HI> where were a num∣ber of gentlemen collected together, I asked them what was the matter, they told me that the soldiers had rushed from <HI>Murray</HI>'s barracks, and had cut several of the inhabitants with their cutlasses; several people were running about the streets, and the cry was God damn the rascals. Some said this will never do, the readiest way to get rid of these people is to attack the <HI>Main guard,</HI> Strike at the root, there is the nest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was this particularly spoken by one or two only?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, it was general, they joined in with one another as they met. I went to the north-side of the <HI>Town-house,</HI> with a view to return to the place from whence I came: I stopt at Mr. <HI>Kent</HI>'s door, and while I was standing there, a∣party of the guard came down from the <HI>Main guard</HI> a cross <HI>King-street.</HI> I turned round and saw a non commissioned offi∣cer (as I took him to be by his appearance) leading the par∣ty, which I at first thought was to relieve the Sentinel at the <HI>Custom-House</HI> as usual, but perceiving this guard was going down to support the Sentinel, I thought it time to go where I came from, to tell the gentlemen what I had seen accord∣ing to promise. I proceeded down street on the <HI>Custom house</HI> side, on the flat stones; the soldiers were drawn up in two ranks front and rear, as I thought it, they had not had time to form as I came down; I walked betwixt the two ranks, they were then loading their pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you hear any orders given for loading?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. Passing betwixt the ranks, their guns being on a loading position, I passed leisurly through, and they put their guns and bayonets up to let me go through. I re∣turned to the Bunch of Grapes from whence I came, I saw Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> and the other gentlemen on the steps, Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> asked me to give an account of this matter, I told him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could give no account, except a general one, that the sol∣diers had come out of their barracks, and that they had been a quarreling, and the Sentinel had been inturrup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his duty. Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> asked me what was that collection

<P>I was, in company with others. I was called that e∣vening about eleven o'clock to him, I was engaged with Mr. <HI>Paine</HI> and could not go; next morning I went; after dressing his wounds, I advised him never to go again into quarrels and riots; He said he was very sorry he did go.— Dr. <HI>Lloyd</HI> who was present, turned round to me and said, <HI>Jeffries,</HI> I believe this man will be able to tell us how the affair was, we had better ask him: I asked him then how long he had been in <HI>King-street</HI> when they fired? He said he went from Mr. <HI>Field</HI>'s when the bells rung, when he got to <HI>Walker</HI>'s corner, he saw many persons coming from <HI>Cornhill,</HI> who he was told had been quarreling with the soldiers down there, that he went with them as far as the stocks, that he stopped there, but they passed on: While he was standing there he saw many things thrown at the Sentry. I asked him if he knew what was thrown? He said he heard the things strike against the guns, and they sounded hard, he believed they were oyster shells and ice; he heard the peo∣ple huzza every time they heard any thing strike that sound∣ed hard: that he then saw some soldiers going down to∣wards the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> that he saw the people pelt them as they went along, after they had got down there, the cros∣ed over towards <HI>Warden</HI> and <HI>Vernon</HI>'s shop, in order to set what they would do, that as he was passing he was shot,— that he was taken up and carried home to Mr. <HI>Field</HI>'s by some of his friends. I asked him whether he thought the soldiers would fire? He told me he thought the soldiers would have fired long before. I then asked him whether he thought the soldiers were abused a great deal, after they went down there? He said, he thought they were. I ask∣ed him whether he thought the soldiers would have been
<PB N="125" REF="011683_0063_0F87C7E98D169DD0"/>
hurt, if they had not fired? He said, he really thought they would, for he heard many voices cry out, kill them. I asked him then, meaning to close all, whether he thought they fired in self defence, or on purpose to destroy the peo∣ple? He said, he really thought they did fire to defend themselves; that he did not blame the man whoever he was, that shot him. This conversation was on <HI>Wednesday.</HI> He always gave the same answers to the same questions, e∣very time I visited him.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was he apprehensive of his danger?</P>

<P>He was told of it.

He pointed to one, and said that was Capt. <HI>Goldfinch;</HI> while the gentleman was talking with Capt. <HI>Gold∣finch</HI> (it was some time, about seven or eight minutes I stood on the same spot) there was a great deal of abusive lan∣guage given to them, they were repeatedly called lobsters; they promised the gentleman who was speaking to them, that if any body had been injured, enquiry should be made next day, and the persons should be punished, I heard this re∣peated four or five different times, they spoke also to the peo∣ple in general; while they were talking I saw snowballs thrown at the officers, which struck the door before which they stood; they begged the people would go away; they said they would not; the officers said, they had done all they could, they had turned the soldiers in and shut the gate, that no soldiers should come out that evening; some body replied, you mean they dare not come out, you dare not let them out; many persons cried let us go home, others said no, we shall find some soldiers in <HI>King street,</HI> a number of them then passed up the alley; as they went up they haz∣zaed and made a noise against the fences and side of the walls; I then passed up the alley myself into <HI>Cornhill,</HI> as soon as I go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of the alley I heard the <HI>Old-Brick</HI> bell ring.</P>

<P>On the evening of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> I was in my own house, betwixt nine and ten I heard the bells ring for fire, I went out of the house and came into <HI>King-street</HI>; I there saw the soldiers and the officer. I went to the officer and asked

him if his men were loaded, he said they were; I asked him if they were loaded with ball he made me no answer, I asked if they were going to fire, he said they could not fire without his orders; directly I saw a snow ball and stick come from behind me which struck the grenadier on the right, which I took to be <HI>Warren,</HI> he fended in off with his musket as well as he could, and immediately he fired.</P>

<SPEAKER>Q</SPEAKER>
<P>Where did he stand?</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was the first man on the right, and the third man from the officer; immediately after the first gun, the offi∣cer turned to the right and I turned to the left and went down the lane; I heard the word fire given, but whether it was the town's people or the officer, I do not know.</P>

<P>Directly on the first gun's going off, did any close in upon the soldiers, and aim a blow or blows at them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did myself, whether any one else did or not I cannot tell. When I was about three or four rod from my own house, I heard the soldiers were quarrelling with the inhahitants, some inhabitants said, We had better go and see it out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What number was coming down along with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Six or eight, in some places eight or ten, in others one after another, all the way along from the <HI>South-end</HI>; the people were saying, the soldiers were quarrelling with the inhabitants—breeding a rumpus—going to beat the inhabit∣ants.

<P>On the evening of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> I left my house in <HI>Winter street,</HI> and went to see a friend in the neighbourhood of Dr. <HI>Cooper</HI>'s meeting. I went down the main-street, and coming near <HI>Boylston</HI>'s <HI>alley,</HI> I saw a number of boys and children from twelve to fifteen years old, betwixt Mr. <HI>Jack∣son</HI>'s and the alley; some of them had walking canes. A number of soldiers, I think four, fallied out of the alley.</P>

<P>What time of night was it?</P>

<P>About five minutes after nine. I took the soldiers for grenadiers, all of them had cutlasses drawn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did they come out of the barracks?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>They came out of the alley, and I imagine from the barracks; they fell on these boys, and every body else that came in their way, they struck them; they followed me and almost overtook me, I had the advantage of them and run as far as Col. <HI>Jackson's,</HI> there I made a stand, they came down as far as the stone shop.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you see that their cut lasses were drawn?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it was a very bright night, these lads came down, some of them came to the <HI>Market square,</HI> one got a stave, others pieces of pine, they were very small, I do not know whether any of the lads were cut.—I turned and then saw an oyster-man, who said to me, damn it here is what I have got by going up; (showing his shoulder wounded) I put my finger into the wound and blooded it very much.—This oys∣ter man made a stand, and several people got round him asking him questions.</P>

</SP>

<P>When you got to <HI>Dock-square,</HI> were there a number of people there?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>This affair of the oyster-man gathered numbers, before that there were not above eight, all little lads, in a little time I imagine about twenty gathered. I passed up <HI>Royal-exchange-lane</HI> by the Sentinel, quite near him, I suppose there were not above fifteen persons in <HI>King-street,</HI> very few for such a pleasant night; it was then about fifteen minutes after nine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Where was the Sentinel?</P>

<P>Close to the corner of the <HI>Custom house,</HI> I came quite near him.</P>

<P>Did the bells ring then?</P>

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. I went up from <HI>Royal exchange-lane</HI> to the north∣side of the <HI>Town house,</HI> and when I came there the <HI>Old Brick</HI> meeting house bell began to ring.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Q.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did this gather a great many?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. I proceeded towards home, I met several of my acquaintance and told them there was no fire, but there had been a quarrel with the soldiers and inhabitants, but that it was all over, in paticular I met Mr. <HI>Chase,</HI> present∣ly after another bell rung.</P>

soldiers were coming up to cut down <HI>Liberty-tree</HI>; I then went out to make enquiry, when I came out of the door, be∣fore I had got into <HI>King-street,</HI> I met Mr. <HI>Walker</HI> the ship car∣penter, I asked him what the matter was? He said the sol∣ers had sallied out from <HI>Smith</HI>'s barracks, and had fell on the inhabitants, and had cut and wounded a number of them, but that they were drove into the barracks: I then went to my house to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> form Mrs. <HI>Payne</HI> that it was not fire, apprehending she m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t be frightned; I immediately went out again, and whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> came into the street, there was no∣body in the street at all; the Sentry at the <HI>Custom House</HI> was walking by himself as usual nobody pear him; I went up towards the <HI>Town house,</HI> and stood by the watch-house, where were a number of people, I enquired of them what the matter was? They gave me the same account Mr <HI>Walker</HI> did. While I stood there, I heard a considerable noise in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> and presently I heard a noise of some people coming up <HI>Silsby</HI>'s-<HI>alley,</HI> at first I imagined it was soldiers coming up that alley, and had some thoughts of retiring up the <HI>Town∣house</HI> steps, but soon found they were inhabitants, I stood till they came up to me, I believe there might be twenty at the extent, some of the persons had sticks, some had not, I believe there were as many with sticks as without, they made a considerable noise, and cried, where are they?— Where are they? At this time there came up a barber's boy and said the Sentry at the <HI>Custom house</HI> had knocked down a boy belonging to their shop; the people then turned about and went down to the Sentry; I then was left as it were a∣lone: I proceeded towards my own house, when I had got about half way, I met Mr. <HI>Spear</HI> the cooper, he said, Mr. <HI>Payne</HI> do not go away, I am afraid the <HI>Main-guard</HI> will come down; I told him I was more afraid of those people that had surrounded the Sentry, and desired him if he had any influ∣ence over them to endeavour to take them off; I then pro∣ceeded towards my own house, and when I got as far as Mr. <HI>Davis</HI>'s, directly opposite to the <HI>Custom-house</HI>; I saw a number of persons going up the steps at the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> and heard a violent knocking at the door, the Sentry stood by the box as I took it, I stopt to see if they opened the <HI>Custom house</HI> door to let them in, I found they did not open the door; I then retired to my own house, and stood on the fill of my door.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Honours, and you Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have at length gone through the evidence in be∣half of the prisoners. The witnesses have now placed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦fore
<PB N="135" REF="011683_0068_0F87C7EC9D904490"/>
you, that <HI>state of facts,</HI> from which results our defence. The examination has been so lengthy, that I am afraid some painful sensations arise, when you find that you are now to fit and hear the remarks of council. But you should reflect, that no more indulgence is shown to the Pri∣soners now on trial, than has ever been shown in all capi∣tal can see: the trial of one man has often taken up several days, when you consider, therefore, that there are eight li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> issue, the importance of the trial will show the ne∣cessity of its length. To each of the prisoners different e∣vidence applies, and each of them draw their defence from different quarters.</P>
<P>I stated to you, Gentlemen, your duty, in opening this muse—do not forget the discharge of it. You are paying a debt you owe the community for your own protection▪ and safety: by the same mode of trial are your own rights to receive a determination; and in your turn, a time may come, when you will expect and claim a similar return from some other jury of your fellow subjects.</P>
<P>In opening, I pointed out the dangers to which you were exposed; I trust your own recollection will now preclude a recapitulation of them. The reasons of what I then said, I trust have in some measure appeared: the propriety of some of those observations has been corroborated by succeeding e∣vidence; and you must have traced yourselves, some of these consequences, turning out in evidence, which have had an intimate relation, if not their origin, with some or all of those opinions, notions, sentiments or passions (call them what you will) which I too<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> occasion to observe, as clues, aids, and leading strings, in our intended examination and decision.</P>
<P>How much need was there for my desire, that you should suspend your judgment till the witnesses were all examin∣ed? How different is the complexion of the cause? Will not all this serve to show every honest man, the little truth to he attained in partial hearings? We have often seen com∣munities complain of <HI>ex parte</HI> testimonies: individuals, as well as societies, of men, are equally susceptible of injuries of this kind: this trial ought to have another effect▪ it should serve to convince us all, of the impropriety, nay in∣justice, of giving a latitude in conversation upon topicks, likely to come under a judicial decision; the criminality of this conduct is certainly inhanced, when such loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sallies
<PB N="136" REF="011683_0069_0F87C7F030B22408"/>
and discourses are so prevalent as to be likely to touch the life of a citizen. Moreover there is so little certainty to be obtained by such kind of methods, I wonder we so often find them practiced. In the present case, how great was the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>possession against us? And I appeal to you, Gentle∣men, what cause there now is to alter our sentiments▪ Will any sober, prudent man countenance the proceedings of the people in <HI>King-street</HI>—can any one justify their conduct—is there any one man, or any body of men, who are interest∣ed to espouse and support their conduct? Surely no. But <HI>our</HI> enquiry must be confined to the <HI>legality</HI> of their conduct▪ and here can be no difficulty. It was certainly illegal, un∣less many witnesses are directly perjured: Witnesses who have no apparent interest to falsify—witnesses, who have given their testimony with candor and accuracy—witnesses, whose credibility stands untouched—whose credibility, the council for the king, do not pretend to impeach; or hin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a suggestion to their disadvantage.</P>
<P>I say, Gentlemen, by the standard of the law are <HI>we</HI> to judge the actions of the people who were the assailants, and those who were the assailed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen on duty. And here▪ Gentlemen, the rule, we formerly laid down, takes place. To the <HI>facts,</HI> Gentlemen, apply yourselves. Consider them as testified: weigh the credibility of the witnesses— balance their testimony—compare the several parts of it— see the amount of it:—and then according to your oaths —"Make <HI>true</HI> deliverance according to your <HI>evidence.</HI>" That is Gentlemen, having settled the facts—bring them truely to the standard of the law; the king's judges who are acquainted with it, who are presumed best to know it, will then inspect this great standard of right and wrong, truth and justice; and they are to determine the degree of guilt to which <HI>the fact</HI> rises.</P>
<P>But before we come to those divisions of enquiry, under which I intend to consider the evidence, let me once more carefully distinguish between the transactions in <HI>Cornhill</HI> and those by the <HI>Custom House.</HI></P>
<P>The conduct of the soldiers in <HI>Cornhill</HI> may well be sup∣posed to have exasperated the minds of all who beheld their behaviour. Their actions accumulated guilt as it flew —at least, we may well suppose, the incensed people who related them, added new colours to the scene. The flame of resentment imperceptibly enkindles, and a common ac∣quaintance
<PB N="137" REF="011683_0069_0F87C7F030B22408"/>
with human nature will shew, that it is no ex∣travagant supposition, to imagine many a moderate man might at such a season, with such sentiments, which I have more than once noticed;—hearing such relations and complaints; I say do I injure any one, in supposing, that under all these circumstances, a very moderate person, who in ordinary matters acted with singular dis∣cretion, should now be drawn imperceptibly away, or ra∣ther transported into measures, which in a future moment he would condemn and lament. What more natural sup∣position, than to suppose many an honest mind might at this time fluctuate thus.—The soldiers are here—we wish them away: we did not send for them—they have cut and wounded the peaceable inhabitants, and it may be my turn next. At this instant of time, he has a fresh detail of in∣juries—resentment redoubles every successive moment—huz∣za! for the <HI>Main-guard</HI>: we are in a moment before the <HI>Custom-House.</HI> No time is given for recollection. We find, from the king's evidence, and from our own, the cry was "Here is a soldier!" Not here is <HI>the soldier</HI> who has injured us—here is the fellow who wounded the man in <HI>Cornihll.</HI> No, the reasoning or rather ferment seems to be, the soldiers have committed an outrage, we have an equal right to in∣flict punishment—or rather revenge, which they had to make an assault.—They said right, but never considered, that, <HI>those</HI> soldiers had <HI>no right</HI> at all. These are senti∣ments natural enough to persons in this state of mind—we can easily suppose even good men thinking and acting thus. Very similar to this is the force of Dr. <HI>Hirons</HI>'s testimony, and some others. But our enquiry is—What says the law? We must calmly enquire, whether this, or any thing like it, is countenanced by the law. What is <HI>natural</HI> to <HI>the man,</HI> what are his feelings are one thing: what is the <HI>duty</HI> of the <HI>citi∣zen</HI> is quite another. Reason must resume her seat—and then we shall hear, and obey the voice of the law.</P>
<P>The law indulges no man in being his own avenger.— Early, in the history of jurisprudence, we find the sword taken from the party injured, and put into the hands of the magistrate. Were not this the case, punishment would know no bounds in extent or duration. Besides, it saps the very root of distributive justice, when any individual in∣vades the prerogative of law, and snatches from the civil magistrate the balance and the rod. How much more are the
<PB N="138" REF="011683_0070_0F87C7F0BA720D28"/>
pillars of security shaken, when a mixt body, assembled as those in <HI>King-street,</HI> assume the province of justice, and in∣vade the rights of the citizen? For it must not be forgot, that the soldier is a citizen, equally intitled with us all to protection and security. Hence all are alike obliged to pay obedience to the law: For the price of this protection is that of obedience.</P>
<P>Let it not be apprehended, that I am advancing a doc∣trine, that a soldier may attack an inhabitant, and he not allowed to defend himself. No Gentlemen! if a soldier rush violently through the street and presents a weapon of death, in a striking posture; no doubt the person assailed may defend himself, even to taking the life of the ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l∣ant. Revenge and a sense of self preservation instantly take possession of the person thus attacked; and the law goes not upon the absurd supposition, that a person can in these circumstances, unman himself. Hence we find a hus∣band, taking his wife in the act of adultery, instantly seizes a deadly weapon and slays the adulterer;—it is not murder. Nay a fillip upon the nose or forehead, in an∣ger, is supposed by the law to be sufficient provocation to reduce killing to Manslaughter. It is, therefore, upon prin∣ciples like these, principles, upon which those, who now bear the hardest against us, at other times, so much de∣pend; it is, I say, upon the right of self-defence and self-preservation we rely for our acquittal.</P>
<P>Here again it should be kept in view, that whenever the party injurying has escaped by flight, and time sufficient for the passions to cool, in judgment of law, hath elapsed; however great the injury, the injured party must have re∣course to law for his redress. Such is the wisdom of the law; of that law, than which we are none of us to presume ourselves wiser;—of that law, which is sonned in the ex∣perience of ages, and which in condescension to the infir∣mities of flesh and blood (but to nothing else) extenuates the offence. For

the outrage in <HI>Cornhill, had absconded</HI>—the soldi∣ers, who are supposed to have done them, were confined in their barracks. People were repeatedly told this, and assured by the military officers, that they should not go unpunished. But what followed? Are all present appeased? We are con∣strained, by the force of the evidence, to affirm they were not. But to get regular and right ideas, we must consider all the commotions of the season, and endeavour to come at truth by analyzing the evidence, and aranging it, under distinct heads of enquiry.</P>

<P>[☞ Mr. <HI>Quincy</HI> now entered, at large, upon a review of the appearances in several parts of the town: he was copious upon the expressions and behaviour sworn to.</P>
<P>He, then, more particularly recapitulated the evidence touching <HI>Murray</HI>'s <HI>Barracks, Dock-square,</HI> and the <HI>Market∣place.</HI></P>
<P>He next pursued several parties, through the several lanes and streets, till they centered at the scene of action.</P>
<P>The testimonies of the witnesses, who swore to the repeat∣ed information given the people;—that the Sentry and par∣ty were on duty;—that they were desired to withdraw and warned of the consequences;—were in their order consider∣ed.</P>
<P>Under the next three heads, was remarked "the temper of the <HI>Sentry,</HI> of the <HI>party of soldiers,</HI> and of the <HI>people surround∣ing them.</HI>"</P>
<P>The <HI>words, insult</HI> and <HI>gestures</HI> of the same persons were next pointed out: and from thence was collected the designs of the persons <HI>assaulting,</HI> and the reasonable apprehensions of those <HI>assaulted.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Quincy</HI> then came to the <HI>attack</HI> itself;—considering who the persons were (namely <HI>some</HI> sailors;) remarking mi∣nutely the words and actions immediately preceeding the onset; the weapons used; the violence of the assualt and battery; and the danger of the soldiers.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Quincy</HI> next exhibited those parts of the testimonies, which evidenced the attack continued <HI>after the firing.</HI></P>
<P>Under all these heads, there was methodically stated the number of the witnesses to each point, and by a compara∣tive view of all the proofs, conclusions drawn as to the force of the whole.</P>
<P>The next consideration, in this mode of enquiry, was the evdience as severally pertaining to <HI>each</HI> prisoner; with
<PB N="140" REF="011683_0071_0F87C7F1213E19F0"/>
such observations, on the one hand, as served to shew a de∣fect of legal proof as to <HI>fact</HI>; on the other, such matters a served to <HI>justify, execuse</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>extenuate</HI> the offence, in law.</P>
<P>And particularly with regard to <HI>Kellroy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Quincy</HI> cited and commented on the following passages from judge <HI>Foster</HI>'s Crown law, and the Marquiss of <HI>Beccaria</HI>'s Essay on Crimes and punishments.</P>
<P>"WORDS are often misrepresented, whether through ignorance, inattention, or malice, it mattereth not the de∣fendant, he is equally effected in either case; and they are extremely liable to misconstruction.

Crown Law, 243.</P>
<P>"Finally, the CREDIBILITY of a witnesses is NULL, when the question relates to the WORDS of a <HI>criminal</HI>; for the tone of voice, the gesture, all that preceds, accom∣panies and follows the different ideas which men annex to the same words, may so alter and modify a man's discourse, that it is almost impossible to repeat them precisely in the manner in which they were spoken. Besides, violent and uncommon actions, such as real crimes, leave a trace in the multitude of circumstances that attend them, and in their effects; but <HI>Words</HI> remain only in the memory of the hearers, who are commonly negligent or prejudiced. It is infimitely easier then to found an accusation on the <HI>Words,</HI> than on the <HI>acti∣ons</HI> of a man; for in these, the number of circumstances, urged against the accused, afford him variety of means of <HI>justifications.</HI>"] Essay 48, 9.</P>

<P>AFTER having thus gone through the evidence, and con∣sidered it as applicatory to <HI>all</HI> and <HI>every</HI> of the prisoners, the next matter in order seems to be the consideration of the law pertinent upon this evidence.</P>
<P>And here, Gentlemen, let me again inform you, that the law which is to pass upon these prisoners, is a law adapting itself to the human speices, with all their feelings, passions and infirmities; a law which does not go upon the absurd supposition, that men are stocks and stones; or that in the fervour of the blood, a man can act with the diliberation and judgment of a philosopher. No Gentlemen:—the law supposes that a principle of resentment, for wise and obvi∣ous
<PB N="141" REF="011683_0071_0F87C7F1213E19F0"/>
reasons, is deeply implanted in the human heart; and not to be eradicated by the efforts of state policy. It, there∣fore, in some degree conforms itself to all the workings of the passions, to which it pays a great indulgence, so far as not to be wholly incompatible, with the wisdom, good order and the very being of government.</P>
<P>Keeping therefore this full in view, let us take once more, a very brief and cursory survey of matters supported by the evidence. And, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, let me ask sober reason—What langu∣age more approbrious—What actions more exasperating, than those used, on this occasion? Words, I am sensible are no <HI>justification</HI> of blows, but they serve as the grand clues to discover the temper and the designs of the agents: they serve also to give us light in discerning the apprehensions and thoughts of those who are the objects of abuse.</P>
<P>"You lobster," "You bloody-back," "You coward" and "You dastard," are but some of the expressions proved.— What words more galling? What more cutting and pro∣voking to a soldier? To be reminded of the colour of his garb, by which he was distinguished from the rest of his fellow citizens; to be compared to the most despicable an∣nimal, that crawls upon the earth, was touching indeed a tender point, To be stigmatized with having smarted un∣der the lash, at the halbert, to be twited with so infamous an ignominy; which was either wholly undeserved, or a grievance which should never have been repeated:—I say to call up and awaken sensations of this kind, must sting e∣ven to madness. But accouple these words with the suc∣ceeding actions,—"You dastard,"—"You coward!"—A soldier and a coward! This was touching, (with a witness) "<HI>The point of honour,</HI> and the pride of virtue."—But while these are as yet fomenting the passions, and swelling the bosom, the attack is made: and probably the latter words were reitterated at the onset; at lest, were yet sound∣ing in the ear. Gentlemen of the jury, for heaven's sake, let us put ourselves in the same situation! Would you not spurn at that spiritless institution of society, which tells you to be a <HI>subject</HI> at the expence of your <HI>manhood?</HI></P>
<P>But does the soldier step out of his ranks to seek his re∣venge? Not a witness pretends it: Did the people repeat∣edly come within the points of their bayonets, and strike on the muzzels of the guns?—You have heard the wit∣nesses.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="011683_0072_0F87C7F1E653CC50"/>Does the law allow one member of the community to be∣have in this manner towards his fellow-citizen, and then bid the injured party be calm and moderate? The expres∣sions from one party were—"Stand off—stand off" <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> "I am upon my station"—"if they molest me <HI>upon my post,</HI> I will fire."—"By God I will fire!"—"Keep off!" These were words likely to produce reflection and procure peace. But had the words on the other hand a similar tendency?— Consider the temper prevalent among all parties at this time. Consider the then situation of the soldiery; and come to the heat and pressure of the action. The materi∣als are laid, the spark is raised, the fire inkindles, the flame rages, the understanding is in wild disorder, all pru∣dence and true wisdom are utterly consumed. Does com∣mon sense, does the law expect impossibilities? <HI>Here,</HI> to ex∣pect equanimity of temper, would be as irrational, as to ex∣pect discretion in a mad man. But was any thing done on the part of the assailants, similar to the conduct, warn∣ings and declarations of the prisoners? Answer for your∣selves, Gentlemen. The words reiterated, all around, stabbed to the heart, the actions of the assailants tended to a worse end: To awaken every passion of which the hu∣man breast is susceptible. Fear, anger, pride, resentment, revenge, alternately, take possession of the whole man. To expect, under these circumstances, that such words would asswage the tempest, that such actions would allay the flames—You might, as rationally, expect the inundations of a torrent would suppress a deluge; or rather, that the flames of Etna would extinguish a conflagration!</P>
<P>Prepare, Gentlemen of the Jury, now to attend to that species of law, which will adapt itself to this trial, with all its singular and aggravating circumstances. A law full of benignity, full of compassion, replete with mercy.</P>
<P>And here, Gentlemen, I must, agreeable to the method we formerly adopted, first tell you by what law the priso∣ners are <HI>not</HI> to be tried, or condemned. And they most certainly are <HI>not</HI> to be tried by the <HI>Mosaic</HI> law: a law, we take it, peculiarly designed for the government of a pecu∣liar nation, who being in a great measure under a theo∣cratical form of government, it's institutions cannot, with any propriety, be adduced for our regulation in these days. It is with pain, therefore, I have observed any endeavour to mislead our judgment on this occasion; by drawing our at∣tention
<PB N="143" REF="011683_0072_0F87C7F1E653CC50"/>
to the precepts delivered in the days of <HI>Moses;</HI> and by disconnected passages of Scriptures, applied in a man∣ner foreign to their original design or import, there seems to have been an attempt to touch some peculiar sentiments, which we know are thought to be prevalent; and in this way, we take it, an injury is like to be done, by giving the mind a biass, it ought never to have received; because it is not warranted by our laws.</P>
<P>We have heard it publicly said of late, oftener, than for∣merly,
<Q>Whosoever shedeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.</Q>
This is plainly, Gentlemen, a general rule, which, like all others of the kind must have its ex∣ceptions. A rule, which if taken in it's strict litteral lattitude, would imply, that a man killing another in self defence, would incur the pains of death. A doctrine, which no man in his senses would ever embrace: a doctrine that certainly never prevailed under the <HI>Mosaical</HI> instituti∣on. For we find, the <HI>Jews</HI> had their six cities of refuge, to which the manslayer might flee, from the avenger of blood. And something analogous to this, (if it did not originate from it) is our benefit of clergy.</P>
<P>And so, that "the <HI>murderer</HI> shall flee to the pit" comes under the same consideration. And when we hear it asked, as it very lately has been, "Who DARE stay him?" I an∣swer, if the laws of our country stay him, you ought to do likewise; and every good subject <HI>dares</HI> to do what the law allows. But the very position is <HI>begging the question:</HI> for the question, now in issue, is, whether either of the prisoners is <HI>a murderer,</HI> in the sense of our laws; for you recollect, that what is murder and what not, is <HI>a question of law,</HI> aris∣ing upon facts stated and allowed.</P>
<P>But to go on;
<Q>You shall take no satisfaction for the life of a <HI>murderer,</HI> which is <HI>guilty of death.</HI></Q>
Here again, is a begging the question; and moreover the words "<HI>guilty of death,</HI>" if rightly rendered from the original, must be one of those general rules, I just now mentioned; which always have their exceptions. But those words seem to be wrong translated; for in the margin of our great bible, we find them rendered "<HI>faulty to die.</HI>" Against a position of this kind we have no objection. If we have committed <HI>a fault,</HI> on which <HI>our laws</HI> inflict the punishment of <HI>death,</HI> we must suffer. But what fault we have committed you are to enquire: or rather you, Gentlemen, are to find the
<PB N="144" REF="011683_0073_0F87C7F2D6D33360"/>
<HI>facts proved in Court against us,</HI> and the Judges are to see and consider what the law pronounces touching our offence, and what punishment is thereby inflicted as a penalty.</P>
<P>In order to come at the whole law resulting from the facts which have been proved, we must enquire into the LEGALITY of the <HI>assemblies.</HI> For such is the wisdom and policy of the law, that if any assembly be <HI>lawful,</HI> each in dividual of that assembly is answerable <HI>only for his own<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> act,</HI> and <HI>not for any other.</HI> On the contrary, if an assembly be <HI>unlawful, the act of any one</HI> of the company, to the particu∣lar purpose of assembling, is <HI>chargeable on all.</HI> This is law, which no lawyer will dispute; it is a law founded in the security of the peace of society, and however little consi∣dered, by people in general, it ought now steadily to be kept in mind.</P>
<P>Was the assembly of the soldiers lawful?</P>
<P>For What did the soldiers assemble?</P>

<P>The law laid down, in <HI>Foster,</HI> 261, 2. before cited, being indisputable law, not denied or controverted; and being very material in the trial, and much relied on by the pri∣soners, is here set down at large.</P>
<P>"I will mention a case, (says the learned Judge,) which through the ignorance or leuity of juries hath been some∣times brought within the rule of accidental death. It is where a blow aimed at <HI>one</HI> person lighteth upon <HI>another</HI> and killeth him. This, in a loose way of speaking, may be cal∣led accidental <HI>with regard to the person who dieth by a blow not intended against</HI> HIM. But the law considereth this case in a quite different light. If from circumstances it appear∣eth that the injury intended to A. be it by poison, blow, or ANY OTHER MEANS OF DEATH, would have amounted to murder, supposing <HI>him</HI> to have been killed by it, it will amount to the same offence if B. happeneth to fall by the same means. Our books say, that in this case the malice <HI>egreditur personam</HI> But to speak more intelligibly, where the injury intended against A. proceeded from a wicked, murderons, or mischievous motive, the party is answerable for all the consequences of the action, if death ensues, from
<PB N="146" REF="011683_0074_0F87C7F35CE0CAB0"/>
it, though it had not its effect upon the person whom he intended to destroy. The <HI>malitia</HI> I have already explained, the heart regardless of social duty DELIBERATELY bent upon mischief, consequently the guilt of the party is just the same in the one case as the other. <HI>On the other hand,</HI> if the blow intended against A. and lighting on B. <HI>arose from a sudden trasport of passion</HI> which in case A. had died by it, <HI>would have been reduced to manslaughter,</HI> the fact will admit of the SAME ALLEVIATION if B. should happen to fall by it." To the same effect are other authorities.</P>

<P>I have now gone thro' those authorities in law, which I thought pertinent to this trial. I have been thus lengthy, not for the information of the Court, but to satisfy you, Gentlemen, and all who may chance to hear me, of that law, which is well known to those of us, who are conver∣sant in cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, but not so generally known, or attended to, by many, as <HI>it ought to be.</HI> A law which extends to each of us, as well as to any of the prisoners; for it knows <HI>no dis∣tinction of persons.</HI></P>
<P>And the doctrines which have been thus laid down are for the safeguard of us all. Doctrines which are founded in the wisdom and policy of ages; which the greatest men, whoever lived, have adopted and contended for. Nay, the matter has been carried, by very wise men, much further than we have contested for. And that you may not think the purport of the authorities read, are the rigid notions of a dry system, and the contracted decisions of municipal law, I beg leave to read to you a passage from a very great, theortic, writer: a man whose praises have resounded through all the known world, and probably will, through all ages, whose sentiments are as free air, and who has done as much for learning, liberty, and mankind, as any of the Sons of <HI>Adam</HI>; I mean the sagacious Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>: He will tell you, Gentlemen, in his Essay on Government, p. 2. c. 3. "That <HI>all manner of force without right</HI> puts man in a state of <HI>war</HI> with the <HI>aggressor</HI>; and of consequence, that, being in such a state of <HI>war,</HI> he may LAWFULLY KILL him, who put him under this <HI>unnatural</HI> restraint." According to this doctrine, we should have nothing to do, but enquire, whe∣ther here was "<HI>force without right</HI>:" if so, we were <HI>in such a state,</HI> as rendered it LAWFUL TO KILL the aggressor, who
<PB N="147" REF="011683_0074_0F87C7F35CE0CAB0"/>
<Q>put us under so <HI>unnatural</HI> a <HI>restraint.</HI> Few, I believe, will say, after hearing <HI>all</HI> this evidence, that we were under no <HI>unnatural restraint.</HI></Q>
But we don't want to extend matters so far. We cite this author to show the world, that the greatest friends to their country, to universal liberty, and the im∣mutable rights of all men, have held tenets, and advanced maxims favourable to the prisoners at the bar. And al∣though we should not adopt the sentiments of Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> in their most extensive latitude, yet there seems to be some∣thing very analogous to his opinion, which is countenan∣ced in our laws.</P>
<P>There is a spirit which pervades the whole system of <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> jurisprudence, which inspires a freedom of thought, speech and behaviour. Under a form of government like ours, it would be in vain to expect, that pacific, timid, ob∣sequious, and servile temper, so predominant in more despotic governments. From our happy constitution there results it's very natural effects—an impatience of injuries, and a strong resentment of insults: (and a very wise man has said, "He who <HI>tamely</HI> beareth insults <HI>inviteth</HI> injuries.") Hence, I take it, that attention to the "feelings of humanity"— to "humanity and imperfection"—"the infirmities of fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh and blood;"
that attention to
"the indelible rights of mankind;"—that lenity to "the passions of man;"— that "benignity and condescention of the law" so often repeated in our books.</P>
<P>And, indeed, if this were not the case, the genius of our civil constitution and the spirit of our municipal law would be repugnant:—that prime defect in any political system —that grand solecism in state-policy.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>This cause has taken up much of your time, and is like∣ly to take up so much more, that I must hasten to a close: indeed I should not have troubled you, by being thus leng∣thy, but from a sense of duty to the prisoners; they, who, in some sense, may be said to have put their lives in my hands; they whose situation was so peculiar, that we have necessarily taken up more time, than ordinary cases re∣quire: they, under all these circumstances, placed a confi∣dence, it was my duty not to disappoint; and which I have aimed at discharging with fidelity. I trust you, Gentle∣men, will do the like: that you will examine and judge with a becoming temper of mind; remembering that they
<PB N="148" REF="011683_0075_0F87C7F9F3E23230"/>
who are <HI>under oath</HI> to declare the <HI>whole truth,</HI> think and act very differently from by standers, who, being under no¦ties of this kind, take a latitude, which is by no means ad∣missible in a <HI>court of law.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot close this cause better, than by desiring you to consider well the genius and spirit of the law, which will be laid down, and to govern yourselves by this great stan∣dard of truth. To some purposes, you may be said, Gen∣tlemen, to be <HI>Ministers of justice</HI>: and "Ministers (says a learned Judge)
<Q>appointed for the ends of public justice, should have written on their <HI>hearts</HI> the solemn engage∣ments of his Majesty, (at his coronation) to cause law and justice IN MERCY to be executed in <HI>all</HI> his judg∣ments.</Q></P>
<LG>
<L>"The quality of <HI>mercy</HI> is not strained;</L>
<L>"It droppeth like the gentle rain from heaven—</L>
<L>"—It is twice blessed;</L>
<L>"It blesses <HI>him that gives,</HI> and <HI>him that takes.</HI>"</L>
</LG>
<P>I leave you, Gentlemen, hoping you will be directed in your enquiry and judgment; to a right discharge of your duty. We shall all of us, Gentlemen, have an hour of cool reflection—when the feelings and agitations of the day shall have subsided; when we shall view things through a different, and a much juster medium. It is, <HI>then,</HI> we all wish an absolving conscience. May you, Gentlemen, now act such a part, as will hereafter insure it—such a part as may occasion the prisoners to rejoice.—May the blessing of those, who were in jeopardy of life, come upon you— may the blessing of him who is "<HI>not faulty to die,</HI>" dis∣cend and rest upon you and your posterity.</P>

<P>I am for the prisoners at the bar, and shall apologize for it only in the words of the Marquis <HI>Beccaria</HI>: "If I can but be the instrument of preserving one life, his blessing and tears of transport, shall be a sufficient consolation to me, for the contempt of all mankind." As the prisoners stand be∣fore you for their lives, it may be proper, to recollect with what temper the law requires we should proceed to this trial. The form of proceeding at their arraignment, has discovered that the spirit of the law upon such occassions, is
<PB N="149" REF="011683_0075_0F87C7F9F3E23230"/>
conformable to humanity, to common sense and feeling; that it is all benignity and candor. And the trial com∣mences with the prayer of the Court, expressed by the Clerk, to the Supream JUDGE of Judges, empires and worlds: "God send you a good deliverance."</P>
<P>We find, in the rules laid down by the greatest English Judges, who have been the brightest of mankind;—We are to look upon it as more beneficial, that many guilty persons should escape unpunished, than one innocent per∣son should suffer. The reason is, because it's of more im∣portance to community, that innocence should be protect∣ed, than it is, that guilt should be punished; for guilt and crimes are so frequent in the world, that all of them can∣not be punished; and many times they happen in such a manner, that it is not of much consequence to the public, whether they are punished or not. But when innocence it self, is brought to the bar and condemned, especially to die, the subject will exclaim, it is immaterial to me, whether I behave well or ill; for virtue itself, is no security. And if such a sentiment as this, should take place in the mind of the subject, there would be an end to all security whatsoe∣ver. I will read the words of the law itself.</P>
<P>The rules I shall produce to you from Lord Chief Justice <HI>Hale,</HI> whose character as a lawyer, a man of learning and philosophy, and as a christian, will he disputed by nobody living; one of the greatest and best characters, the English nation ever produced: his words are these. 2.

C. <HI>Tutius semper est errare, in acquietando, quam in puniendo, ex∣parte misericerdioe, quam ex parte justifioe,</HI> it is always safer to err in acquitting, than punishing, on the part of mercy, than the part of justice: The next is from the same au∣thority, 305 <HI>Tutius erratur ex parte mitiori,</HI> it is always safer to err on the milder side, the side of mercy, H. H. P. C. 509, the best rule in doubtful cases, is, rather to incline to acquital than conviction: and in page 300 <HI>Quod dubitas ne feceris,</HI> Where you are doubtful never act; that is, if you doubt of the prisoners guilt, never declare him guilty; this is always the rule, especially in cases of life. An other rule from the same Author, 289, where he says, In some cases, presumptive evidence go far to prove a person guil∣ty, though there is no express proof of the fact, to be com∣mitted by him; but then it must be very warily pressed, for
<PB N="150" REF="011683_0076_0F87C7FA76B4A768"/>
it is better, five guilty persons should escape unpunished, than one innocent person should die.</P>
<P>The next authority shall be from another Judge, of equal character, considering the age wherein he lived; that is Chancellor <HI>Fortescue,</HI> in praise of the laws of England, page 59, this is a very ancient writer on the English law: his words are, "Indeed one would rather, much rather, that twenty guilty persons escape the punishment of death, than one innocent person be condemned, and suffer capitally." Lord Chief Justice <HI>Hale,</HI> says, It is better five guilty persons escape, than one innocent person suffer. Lord Chancellor <HI>Fortiscue,</HI> you see, carries the matter farther, and says, In∣deed one had rather, much rather, that twenty guilty per∣sons should escape, than one innocent person suffer capitally. Indeed this rule is not peculiar to the English law, there never was a system of laws in the world, in which this rule did not prevail; it prevailed in the ancient Roman law, and which is more remarkable, it prevails in the modern Roman law, even the Judges in the Courts of Inquisi∣tion, who with racks, burnings and scourges, examine cri∣minals, even there, they preserve it as a maxim, that it is better the guilty should escape punishment, than the inno∣cent suffer. <HI>Satius esse nocentem absolvi quam insentem damnari,</HI> this is the temper we ought to set out with; and these the rules we are to be governed by. And I shall take it for granted, as a first principle, that the eight prisoners at the bar, had better be all acquitted, though we should admit them all to be guilty, than, that any one of them should by your verdict be found guilty, being innocent.</P>
<P>I shall now consider the several divisions of law, under which the evidence will arrange itself.</P>
<P>The action now before you, is homicide; that is the kil∣ling of one man by another, the law calls it homicide, but it is not criminal in all cases, for one man to slay another. Had the prisoners been on the <HI>Plains of Abraham,</HI> and slain an hundred <HI>Frenchmen</HI> a piece, the <HI>English</HI> law would have considered it, as a commendable action, virtuous and prais∣worthy: so that every instance of killing a man, is not a crime in the eye of the law; there are many other instances which I can not enumerate, an officer that executes a per∣son under sentence of death, &amp;c. So that Gentlemen, eve∣ry instance of one man's killing another, is not a crime,
<PB N="151" REF="011683_0076_0F87C7FA76B4A768"/>
much less a crime to be punished with death. But to de∣scend to some more particulars.</P>
<P>The law divides homicide into three branches; the first, is justifiable, the second excusable, and the third felonious; felonious homicide, is subdivided into two branches; the first is murder, which is killing with malice aforethought, the second is manslaughter, which is killing a man on a sudden provocation: here Gentlemen, are four sorts of ho∣micide, and you are to consider, whether all the evidence amounts to the first, second, third, or fourth, of these heads. The fact, was the slaying five unhappy persons that night; you are to consider, whether it was justifiable, excusable, or felonious; and if felonious, whether it was murder or manslaughter. One of these four it must be, you need not divide your attention to any more particu∣lars. I shall however, before I come to the evidence, show you several authorities, which will assist you and me in con∣templating the evidence before us.</P>
<P>I shall begin with justifialbe homicide; if an officer a sheriff execute a man on the gallows, draws and quarters him, as in case of high treason, and cuts off his head, this is justi∣fiable homicide, it is his duty. So also, Gentlemen, the law has planted fences and barriers around every individual; it is a castle round every man's person, as well as his house.— As the love of God and our neighbour, comprehends the whole duty of man, so self-love and social, comprehend all the duties we owe to mankind, and the first branch is self-love, which is not only our indisputable right, but our clearest duty, by the laws of nature, this is interwoven in the heart of every individual; God almighty, whose laws we cannot alter, has implanted it there, and we can an∣nihilate ourselves, as easily as root out this affection for ourselves. It is the first, and strongest principle in our na∣ture, Justice <HI>Blackstone</HI> calls it, "The primary cannon in the law of nature." That precept of our holy religion which commands us to love our neighbour as ourselves doth not command us to love our neighbour better than ourselves, or so well, no Christian Divine hath given this interpretation. The precept enjoins, that our benevolence to our fellow men, should be as real and sincere, as our af∣fections to ourselves, not that it should be as great in de∣gree. A man is authorised therefore by common sense, and the laws of Egland, as well as those of nature, to love
<PB N="152" REF="011683_0077_0F87C7FAE82177D0"/>
himself better than his fellow subject: If two persons are cast away at sea, and get on a plank, (a case put by Sir Francis <HI>Bacon,</HI>) and the plank is insufficient to hold them both, the one hath a right to push the other of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to save himself. The rules of the common law therefore, which authorize a man to preserve his own life at the expence of another's, are not contradicted by any divine or moral law. We talk of liberty and property, but, if we cut up the law of self-defence, we cut up the foundation of both, and if we give up this, the rest is of very little value, and therefore, this principle must be strictly attended to, for whatsoever the law pronounces in the case of these eight soldiers will be the law, to other persons and after ages, all the persons that have slain mankind in this country, from the beginning to this day, had better have been acquitted, than that a wrong rule and precedent should be established.</P>
<P>I shall now, read to you a few authorities on this subject of self-defence. Foster 273 in the case of justi∣fiable self-defence, "The injured party may repell force with force in defence of his person, habitation, or property, against one who manifestly intendeth and en∣deavoureth with violence, or surprize, to commit a known felony upon either."—In these cases, he is not obliged to re∣treat, but may pursue his adversary, till he findeth him∣self out of danger, and if in a conflict between them he happeneth to kill, such killing is justifiable." Keiling, 128, 129. I must intreat you, to consider the words of this authority, the injured person may repell force by force against any who endeavours to commit any kind of felony on him or his, here the rule is, I have a right to stand on my own defence, if you intend to com∣mit felony; if any of the persons made an attack on these soldiers, with an intention to rob them, if it was but to take their hats feloniously, they had a right to kill them on the spot, and had no business to retreat; if a robber meets me in the street, and commands me to surrender my purse, I have a right to kill him without asking questions; if a persons commits a bare assault on me, this will not jus∣tify killing, but if he assaults me in such a manner, as to discover an intention, to kill me, I have a right to destroy him, that I may put it out of his power to kill me. In the case you will have to consider, I do not know there was any attempt to steal from these persons; however,
<PB N="153" REF="011683_0077_0F87C7FAE82177D0"/>
there were some persons concerned, who would probably enough have stolen, if there had been any thing to steal; and many were there who had no such disposition, but this is not the point we aim at, the question is, are you satisfied, the people made the attack in order to kill the soldiers? If you are satisfied that the people, who ever they were, made that assault, with a design to kill or maim the soldiers, this was such an assault, as will justify the soldiers killing in their own defence. Further it seems to me, we may make ano∣ther question, whether you are satisfied that their real in∣tention was to kill or maim or not? if any reasonable man, in the situation of one of these soldiers, would have had reason to believe in the time of it, that the people came with an intention to kill him, whether you have this satis∣faction now, or not in your own minds, they were justifiable, at least excusable in firing; you and I, may be suspici∣ous that the people who made this assault on the soldiers, did it to put them to the flight, on purpose that they might go exulting about the town afterwards in triumph; but this will not do, you must place yourselves in the situation of <HI>Wemms</HI> or <HI>Killroy</HI>—consider yourselves, as knowing that the prejudices of the world about you, were against you; that the people about you, thought you came to dragoon them into obedience to statutes, instructions, mandates and edicts, which they thoroughly detested; that many of these people were thoughtless and inconsiderate, old and young, sailors and landmen, negroes and molattos; that they, the soldiers had no friends about them, the rest were in opposition to them; with all the bells ringing, to call the town together to assist the people in <HI>King-street</HI>; for they knew by that time, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re was no fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; the people shouting, huzzaing, and making the mob whistle as they call it, which when a boy makes it in the street, is no formidable thing, but when made by a mul∣titude, is a most hideous shriek, almost as terrible as an In∣dian yell; the people crying Kill them! Kill them! Knock them over! heaving snow-balls, oyster shells, clubs, white birch sticks three inches and an half diameter, consi∣der yourselves, in this situation, and then judge, whe∣ther a reasonable man in the soldiers situation, would not have concluded they were going to kill him.—I be∣lieve, if I was to reverse the scene, I should bring it home to our own bosoms; suppose Colonel <HI>Marshall,</HI> when he came out of his own door, and saw these grenadiers com∣ing
<PB N="154" REF="011683_0078_0F87C7FBA97F65D8"/>
down with swords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had thought it proper to have appointed a military watch; suppose he had assembled <HI>Gray</HI> and <HI>Attucks</HI> that were killed, or any other persons in town, and applanted them in that station as a military watch, and there had come from <HI>Murray</HI>'s barracks, thirty or forty soldiers, with no other arms than snow-balls, cakes of ice, oyster-shells, cinders and clubs, and attacked this military watch in this manner, what do you suppose would have been the feelings and reasonings of any of our house∣holders; I confess I believe they would not have borne the one half of what the witnesses have sworn the soldiers bore, till they had shot down as many as were necessary to intimidate and disperse the rest; because, the law does not oblige us to bear insults to the danger of our lives, to stand still with such a number of people round us, throwing such things at us, and threatening our lives, until we are disabled to defend our s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves.</P>
<P>"Where a known felony, is attempted upon the person, be it to rob, or murder, here the party assaulted may re∣pel force with force, and even his own servant then atten∣dant on him, <HI>or any other person present,</HI> may interpose for preventing mischief, and if death ensues, the party so in∣terposing will be justified.—In this case nature and social duty co-operate." Foster 274.</P>
<P>Hawkins P. C. Chap. 28, § 25. towards the end, "Yet it seems that a private person, a <HI>fortiori,</HI> an officer of justice, who happens unavoidably to kill another in endeavouring to defend himself from, or suppress dangerous rioters, may justify the fact, in as much as he only does his duty in aid of the public justice." Section 24. "And I can see no rea∣son why a person, who without provocation is assaulted by another in any place whatsoever, in such a manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plainly shews an intent to murder him, as by discharging a pistol, or pushing at him with a drawn sword, &amp;c. may not justify killing such an assailant, as much as if he had at∣tempted to rob him: For is not he who attempts to murder me, more injurious than he who barely attempts to rob me? And can it be more justifiable to fight for my goods than for my life; and it is not only highly a∣greeable to reason that a man in such circumstances, may lawfully kill another, but it seems also to be confirmed by the general tenor of our law books, which speaking of ho∣micide <HI>se defendo,</HI> suppose it done in some quarrel or affray.."</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="011683_0078_0F87C7FBA97F65D8"/>"And so perhaps the killing of dangerous rioters, may he justified by any private persons, who cannot otherwise suppress them, or defend themselves from them; in as much as every private person seems to be authorized by the law, to aim himself for the purposes aforesaid." Hawkins p. 71. § 14.— Here every private person is authorized to arm himself, and on the strength of this authority, I do not de∣ny the inhabitants had a right to arm themselves at that time, for their defence, not for offence, that distinction is material and must be attended to.</P>
<P>Hawkins, page 75. § 14. "And not only he who on an assault retreats to the wall or some such streight, beyond which he can go no further, before he kills the other, is judged by the law to act upon unavoidable necessity; but also he who being assaulted in such a manner, and in such a place, that he cannot go back without manifestly endanger∣ing his life, kills the other without retreating at all."—§ 16. "And an officer who kills one that insults him in the execu∣tion of his office, and where a private person, that kills one who feloniously assaults him in the high way, may justify the fact without ever giving back at all."</P>
<P>There is no occasion for the Magistrate to read the Riot. act.— In the case before you, I suppose you will be satis∣fied when you come to examine the witnesses, and compare it with the rules of the common law, abstracted from all mutiny-acts and articles of war, that these soldiers were in such a situation, that they could not help themselves; peo∣ple were coming from <HI>Royal exchange-lane,</HI> and other parts of the town, with clubs, and cord wood sticks; the soldi∣ers were planted by the wall of the <HI>Custom House</HI>; they could not retreat, they were surrounded on all sides, for there were people behind them, as well as before them; there were a number of people in <HI>Royal-exchange lane</HI>; the soldiers were so near to the <HI>Custom house,</HI> that they could not retreat, unless they had gone into the brick wall of it. I shall shew you presently, that all the party concerned in this unlawful design, were guilty of what any one of them did; if any body threw a snow-ball, it was the act of the whole party; if any struck with a club, or threw a club, and the club had killed any body, the whole party would have been guilty of murder in law.</P>
<P>Ld. C. J. HOLT, in Mawgrige's Case, Keyling 128, saye, "Now it hath been held, that if A of his malice prepensed
<PB N="156" REF="011683_0079_0F87C7FC629E4248"/>
assaults B, to kill him, and B draws his sword and attacks A and pursues him, then A for his safety gives back, and re∣treats to a wall, and B still pursuing him with his drawn sword. A in his defence kills B. This is murder in A. For A having malice against B, and in pursuance thereof endea∣vouring to kill him, is answerable for all the consequences, of which he was the original cause. It is not reasonable for any man that is dangerously assaulted, and when he per∣ceives his life in danger from his adversary, but to have li∣berty for the security of his own life, to pursue him that maliciously assaulted him; for he that hath manifested that he hath malice against another, is not fit to be trusted with a dangerous weapon in his hand. And so resolved by all the Judges when they met at Seargeant's inn, in prepara∣tion for my <HI>Lord Morley</HI>'s trial."</P>
<P>In the case here, we will take <HI>Montgomery,</HI> if you please, when he was attacked by the stout man with the stick, who aimed it at his head, with a number of people round him, crying out, Kill them! Kill them! had he not a right to kill the man. It all the party were guilty of the assault made by the stout man, and all of them had discovered malice in their hearts, had not <HI>Montgomery</HI> a right, accord∣ing to Lord Chief Justice <HI>Holt,</HI> to put it one of their pow∣er to wreak their malice upon him. I will not at present, look for any more authorities in the point of self-defence; you will be able to judge from these, how far the law goes, in justifying or excusing any person in defence of himself, or taking away the life of another who threatens him, in life or limb: the next point is this, That in case of an unlawful assembly, all and every one of the assembly is guilty of all and every unlawful act, committed by any one of that assembly, in prosecution of the unlawful de∣sign they set out upon.</P>
<P>Rules of law should be universally known, what ever ef∣fect they may have on politics; they are rules of common law, the law of the land, and it is certainly true, that where ever there is an unlawful assembly, let it consist of many persons or a few, every man in it is guilty of every unlaw∣ful act of committed by any one of the whole party, be they more or be they less, in pursuance of their unlawful design. This is the policy of the law: to discourage and pre∣vent riots, insurrections, turbulence and tumults.</P>
<P>In the continual vicissitudes of human things, amidst the
<PB N="157" REF="011683_0079_0F87C7FC629E4248"/>
shocks of fortune and the whirls of passion, that take place at certain critical seasons, even in the mildest government, the people are liable to run into riots and tumults.—There are Church-quakes and state-quakes, in the moral and political world, as well as earthquakes, storms and tempests in the physical—Thus much however must be said in favour of the people and of human nature, that it is a ge∣neral, if not universal truth, that the aptitude of the people to mutinies, seditions, tumults and insurrections, is in direct proportion to the despotism of the government.— In governments compleatly despotic, <HI>i.e.</HI> where the will of one man, is the only law, this disposition is most prevalent. —In Aristocracies, next—in mixed Monarchies, less than ei∣ther of the former—in compleat Republick's the least of all —and under the same form of government as in a limited monarchy, for example, the virtue and wisdom of the ad∣ministration, may generally be measured by the peace and order, that are seen among the people.—However this may be, such is the imperfection of all things in this world, that no form of government, and perhaps no wisdom or virtue in the administration, can at all times avoid riots and disorders among the people."</P>
<P>Now it is from this difficulty, that the policy of the law hath framed such strong discouragements, to secure the people against tumults; because when they once begin, there is danger of their running to such excesses, as will overturn the whole system of government.— There is the rule from the reverend sage of the law, so often quoted before.</P>
<P>I. H. H. P. C. 437. "All present, aiding and assisting, are equally principal with him that gave the stroke, where∣of the party died. For tho' one gave the stroke, yet in in∣terpretation of law, it is the stroke of every person, that was present aiding and assisting."</P>
<P>I. H. H. P. C. 440. "If divers come with one assent to do mischief, as to kill, rob, or beat, and one doth it, they are all principals in the felony. If many be present, and one only gives the stroke whereof the party dies, they are all principal, if they came for that purpose."</P>
<P>Now if the party at <HI>Deck-square,</HI> came with an in∣tention only to beat the soldiers, and began the affray with them, and any of them had been accidentally killed, it would have been murder, because it was an unlawful de∣sign
<PB N="158" REF="011683_0080_0F87C7FD1C7CA9E0"/>
they came upon; if but one does it, they are all con∣sidered in the eye of the law to be guilty, if any one gives the mortal stroke, they are all principal here, therefore there is a reversal of the scene; if you are satisfied, that these soldiers were there on a lawful design and it should be proved any of them shot without provocation and killed a∣ny body, he only is answerable for it. First Hale's pleas of the crown.</P>
<P>I. H. H. P. C. 444. "Although if many come upon an un∣lawful design, and one of the company kill one of the ad∣verse party, in pursuance of that design, all are principals; yet if many be together upon a lawful account, and one of the company, kill another of an adverse party, without any particular abetment of the rest to this fact of homicide they are not all guilty that are of the company, but only those that gave the stroke or actually abetted him to do it."</P>
<P>I. H. H. P. C. 445. "In the case of a riotous assembly to rob or steal deer, or do any unlawful act of violence, there the offence of one, is the offence of all the company."</P>
<P>In an other place, I. H. H. P. C. 439. "The <HI>Lord Dacre</HI> and divers others went to steal deer in the park of one Pel∣ham —Raydon one of the company, killed the keeper in the park: the <HI>Lord Dacre</HI> and the rest of the company being in the other part of the park. Yet it was adjudged murder in them all, and they died for it.—And he quotes Crompton, 25. Dalton 93 p. 241." So that in so strong a case as this, where this nobleman set out to hunt deer in the ground of another, he was in one part of the park, his company in another part, yet they were all guilty of murder."</P>
<P>The, next is <HI>Hale</HI>'s Pleas of the Crown, 1. H. H. P. C. 440. "The case of <HI>Drayton Bassit,</HI> diverse persons doing an un∣lawful act, all are guilty of what is done by one."</P>
<P><HI>Foster</HI> 353, 354. "A general resolution against all oppos∣ers, whether such resolution appears upon evidence to have been actually and implicitly entered into by the confede∣rates, or may reasonably be collected from their number, arms or behoviour, at, or before the scene of action," such resolutions, so proved, have always been considered as strong ingredients in cases of this kind. And in cases of homi∣cide, committed in consequence of them, every person pre∣sent; in the sense of the law, when the homicide hath been committed, hath been involved in the guilt of him that gave the mortal blow."</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="011683_0080_0F87C7FD1C7CA9E0"/><HI>Foster.</HI> "The cases of Lord <HI>Dacre</HI> mentioned by <HI>Hale,</HI> and of <HI>Pudsey,</HI> reported by <HI>Crompton,</HI> and cited by <HI>Hale,</HI> tur∣ned upon this point. The offences they respectively stood charged with as principals, were committed far out of their sight and hearing; and yet both were held to be present. It was sufficient, that at the instant the facts were committed, they were of the same party and upon the same pursuit, and under the same engagements and expectations of mu∣tual defence and support, with those that did the facts."</P>
<P>Thus far I have proceeded, and I believe it will not be hereafter disputed by any body, that this law ought to be known to every one who has any disposition to be concerned in an unlawful assembly, whatever mischief happens in the prosecution of the design they set out upon, all are answer∣able for it. It is necessary we should consider the definitions of some other crimes, as well as murder; sometimes one crime gives occasion to another, an assault is sometimes the occa∣sion of man slaughter, sometimes of excusable homicide. It is necessary to consider what is a riot. 1. <HI>Hawk.</HI> c. 65. § 2. I shall give you the definition of it. "Wheresoever more than three persons uses force or violence, for the accomplishment of any design whatever, all concerned are rioters."</P>
<P>Were there not more than three persons in <HI>Dock-square?</HI> —Did they not agree to go to <HI>King-street,</HI> and attack the <HI>Main guard?</HI>—Where then, is the reason for hesitation, at calling it a riot?—If we cannot speak the law as it is, where is our liberty? And this is law, that wherever more than three persons, are gathered together, to accomplish any thing with force, it is a riot 1. <HI>Hawk.</HI> C. 65. § 2. "Wherever more than three, use force and vio∣lence, all who are concerned therein are rioters: But in some cases wherein the law authorises force, it is lawful and commendable to use it. As for a sheriff, 2. <HI>And</HI> 67. <HI>Poph.</HI> 121. or constable, 3. <HI>H.</HI> 7.10.6. or perhaps even for a private person, <HI>Poph.</HI> 121. <HI>Moore,</HI> 656. to assemble a competent number of people, in order with force, to oppose rebels, or enemies, or rioters, and afterwards with such fOrce, ac∣tually to suppress them."</P>
<P>I do not mean to apply the word rebel on this occasion: I have no reason to suppose that ever there was one in <HI>Bos∣ton,</HI> at least among the natives of the country; but rioters are in the same situation, as far as my argument is con∣cerned,
<PB N="160" REF="011683_0081_0F87C8031A76A0B0"/>
and proper officers may suppress rioters, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may even private persons.</P>
<P>If we strip ourselves free from all military laws, mutiny acts, articles of war and soldiers oaths and consider these priso∣ners as neighbours, if any of their neighbours were attach∣ed in <HI>King-street,</HI> they had a right to collect together to sup∣press this riot and combination. If any number of per∣sons meet together at a fair, or market, and happen to fall together by the ears, they are not guilty of a riot, but of a sudden affray: here is another paragraph which I mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> read to you, 1. <HI>Hawkins,</HI> c. 65. § 3, "If a number of persons, being met together at a fair or market, or on a∣ny other <HI>lawful</HI> and <HI>innocent occasion,</HI> happen on a sud∣den quarrel, to fall together by the ears, they are not guil∣ty of a riot, but of a sudden affray only, of which none are guilty, but those who actually engage in it," &amp;c. End of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. It would be endless, as well as superfluous, to ex∣amine, whether every particular person engaged in a riot, were in truth one of the first assembly, or actually had a previous knowledge of the design thereof.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to produce the best authorities, and to give you the rules of law in their words, for I desire not to advance any thing of my own. I chuse to lay down the rules of law, from authorities which cannot be disputed.— Another point is this, whether, and how far, a private person may aid another in distress? Suppose a press gang should come on shore in this town, and assault any sailor or householder in <HI>King street,</HI> in order to carry them of board one of his Majesty's ships and impress him without a∣ny warrant, as a seaman in his Majesty's service, how sat do you suppose the inhabitants would think themselves war∣ranted by law, to interpose against that lawless press gang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I agree that such a press gang would be as unlawful an as∣sembly, as that was in <HI>King street.</HI> If they were to press a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inhabitant, and carry him off for a sailor, would not the inhabitants think themselves warranted by law to interpose in behalf of their fellow citizens? Now Gentlemen, if the soldiers had no right to interpose in the relief of the Sentry, the inhabitants would have no right to interpose with re∣gard to the citizen, for whatever is law for a soldier, is law for a sailor, and for a citizen, they all stand upon an equ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sooting, in this respect. I believe we shall not have it dis∣puted, that it would be lawful to go into <HI>King-street,</HI> and

help an honest man there, against the press master. We have many instances in the books which authorize it, which I shall produce to you presently.</P>
<P>Now suppose you should have a jealousy in your minds, that the people who made this attack on the Sen∣try, had nothing in their intention more than to take him off his post, and that was threatned by some; suppose they intended to go a little farther, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar and feather him, or to ride him, (as the phrase is in <HI>Hudibras</HI>) he would have had a good right to have stood upon his defence, the defence of his liberty, and if he could not preserve that without hazard to his own life, he would be warranted in depriving those of life, who were endeavouring to deprive him of his; that is a point I would not give up for my right hand, nay, for my life.</P>
<P>Well, I say, if the people did this, or if this was only their intention, surely the officer and soldiers had a right to go to his relief, and therefore they set out upon a lawful errand, they were therefore a lawful assembly, if we only consider them as private subjects and fellow citi∣zens, without regard to Mutiny Acts, Articles of War, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oldiers Oaths; a private person, or any number of private persons, have a right to go to the assistance of their fellow subject in distress and danger of his life, when assaulted and in danger from a few or a multitude. <HI>Keyl.</HI> 136. "If a man perceives another by force to be injuriously treated, pressed and restrained of his liberty, tho' the person abused doth not complain, or call for aid or assistance; and others out of compassion shall come to his rescure, and kill any of those that shall so restrain him, that is manslaughter. <HI>Keyl</HI> — A and others without any warrant, impress B to serve the King at sea, B quietly submitted and went off with the press mas∣ter: <HI>Hugett</HI> and the others pursued them, and required a sight of their warrant; but they shewing a piece of paper that was not a sufficient warrant, thereupon <HI>Hugett</HI> with the others drew their swords, and the press-masters theirs, and so their was a combat, and those who endeavoured to rescue the pressed man killed one of the pretended press-masters. This was but manslaughter, for when the liber∣ty of one subject is invaded, it affects all the rest: It is a provocation to all people, as being of ill example and per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elous consequences."</P>

Lord Chief Justice <HI>Holt</HI> says, 3d. "The prisoner (<HI>i. e. To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y</HI>) in this case had sufficient provocation; for if one be im∣prisioned upon an unlawful authority, it is a sufficient pro∣vocation to all people out of compassion;—and where the liberty of the subject is invaded, it is a provocation to all the subjects of England, &amp;c. and sure a man ought to be concerned for magna charta and the laws; and if any one against the law imprisons a man, he is an offender against magna charta."</P>
<P>I am not insensible of Sir <HI>Michael Foster</HI>'s observation on these cases, but apprehend they do not invalidate the au∣thority of them as far as I now apply them to the purpose of my argument.—If a stranger, a mere fellow subject may interpose to defend the liberty, he may to defend the li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of another individual. But according to the evidence, some imprudent people before the Sentry, proposed to take hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> off his post, others threatned his life, and intelligence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this was carried to the <HI>Main-guard,</HI> before any of the pri∣soners turned out: They were then ordered out to relie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Sentry, and any of our fellow citizens might lawfull<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have gone upon the same errand; they were therefore lawful assembly.</P>
<P>I have but one point more of law to consider, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is this: In the case before you, I do not pretend to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that every one of the unhappy persons slain, were concern∣ed in the riot; the authorities read to you just now, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it would be endless to prove, whether every person that was present and in a riot, was concerned in planning the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enterprise or not: nay, I believe it but justice, to say, some were perfectly innocent of the occasion, I have reason in suppose, that one of them was, Mr. <HI>Maverick</HI>; he was a v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worthy young man, as be has been represented to me, and had no concern in the riotous proceedings of that nig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and I believe the same may be said, in favour of one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at least, Mr. <HI>Caldwell</HI> who was slain; and therefore many people may think, that as he, and perhaps another was in∣nocent, therefore innocent blood having been shed, the must be expiated by the death of somebody or other. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> take notice of this, because one gentleman nominated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the sheriff, for a Juryman upon this trial, because he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said, he believed Capt. <HI>Preston</HI> was innocent, but innoce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> blood had been shed, and therefore somebody ought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hanged for it, which he thought was indirectly giving <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="163" REF="011683_0082_0F87C8032581EDC0"/>
opinion in this cause. I am afraid many other persons have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inted such an opinion; I do not take it to be a rule, that where innocent blood is shed, the person must die. In the instance of the <HI>Frenchmen</HI> on the <HI>Plains of Abraham,</HI> they were innocent, fighting for their King and country, their blood is as innocent as any, there may be multitudes kil∣led, when innocent blood is shed on all sides, so that it is not an invariable rule. I will put a case, in which, I dare say, all will agree with me: Here are two persons, the fa∣ther and the son, go out a hunting, they take different <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds, the father hears a rushing among the bushes, takes it to be game, fires and kills his son through a mistake; here is innocent blood shed, but yet nobody will say the fa∣ther ought to die for it. So that the general rule of law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that whenever one person hath a right to do an act, and that act by any accident, takes away the life of another, it is accusable, it bears the same regard to the innocent as to the guilty. If two men are together, and attack me, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a right to kill them, I strike at them, and by mistake, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke a third and kill him, as I had a right to kill the first, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> killing the other, will be excusable, as it happened by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cident. If I in the heat of passion, aim a blow at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erson who has assaulted me, aiming at him, I kill another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rson, it is but manslaughter. <HI>Foster,</HI> 261 § 3. "If an ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d unlawful in itself be done deliberately and with in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of mischief or great bodily harm to particulars, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f mischief indiscriminately, fall it where it may, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th ensues against or beside the original intention of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, it will be murder. But if such mischievous intenti∣on doth not appear, which is matter of fact and to be col∣lected from circumstances, and the act was done heedlessly had inconsiderately, it will be manslaughter: not acciden∣tal death, because the act upon which death ensued, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lawful."</P>
<P>Under this head, &amp;c. [<HI>See the remainder inserted in pages</HI> 14<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 146.]</P>
<P>Supposing in this case, the Molatto man was the person made the assault, suppose he was concerned in the unlaw∣ful assembly, and this party of soldiers endeavouring to de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d themselves against him, happened to kill another per∣son who was innocent, though the soldiers had no reason <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t we know of, to think any person there, at least of that number who were crouding about them innocent, they
<PB N="164" REF="011683_0083_0F87C803E01FE850"/>
might naturally enough presume all to be guilty of the ri∣ot and assault, and to come with the same design; I say, if on firing on these who were guilty, they accidentally kil∣led an innocent person, it was not their faults, they were obliged to defend themselves against those who were pres∣sing upon them, they are not answerable for it with their lives, for upon supposition it was justifiable or excusable to kill <HI>Attucks</HI> or any other person, it will be equally justifia∣ble or excusable if in firing at him, they killed another who was innocent, or if the provocation was such as to mitigate the guilt to manslaughter, it will equally mitigate the guilt, if they killed an innocent man undesignedly, in aiming at him who gave the provocation, according to Judge <HI>Foster,</HI> and as this point is of such consequence. I must produce some more authorities for it. 1. <HI>Hawkins,</HI> 84. "Also, if a third person accidentally happen to be killed, by one engaged in a combat with another upon a sudden quarrel, it seems that he who kills him, is guilty of man∣slaughter only, &amp;c. H. H. P C. 442. To the same point and 1. H. H. P. C. 484. and 4. <HI>Black.</HI> 27.</P>
<P>I shall now consider one question more, and that is con∣cerning provocation. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The distinction between M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er and Manslaughter, is more easily confounded than many other distinctions of Law relative to Homicide.—And many persons a∣mong us seem to think that the punishment of Death ought to be inflicted upon all voluntary killing one private man by another, whether done suddenly or deliberately, cooly or in anger.—These received notions may have originated partly from a false construction of the general precept to <HI>Noah,</HI> whose sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his be blood be shed.—But may not some of these mistaken notions have been derived from law books—We find the distinction between Murder and Manslaughter, sometimes attributed to the peculiar benignity of the English law, and it is some∣times represented that the particular fact which the law of England calls Manslaughter, and indulges with Clergy, is punished with death in all other laws.</P>
<P><HI>Vide Observations on the Statutes page</HI> 54. By the law of Scotland, there is no such thing as Manslaughter, no by the civil law; and therefore a criminal ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Murder under the Statute of Henry the Eighth, where the Judges proceed by the rules of the civil law, must either be found guilty of the Murder or acquitted.—and in another place, <HI>Observations on the Statutes</HI> 422. <HI>Note</HI> (z.) I have before observed that by the civil law, as well as the law of Scotland, there is no such offence, as what is, with us termed Manslaughter: Sir <HI>Michael Foster</HI> 288. If taking general verdicts of acquittal, in plain cases of deat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <HI>Per Infortunium, &amp;c.</HI> deserveth the name of a deviation, it is far short of what is constantly practised at an Admiraly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essi∣ons, under 28. H. 8. with regard to offences not ousted of Clergy by paticular sta∣tutes, which had they been committed at land would have been intituled to Clergy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ In these cases the Jury is constantly directed to acquit the prisoner; because the ma∣rine law doth not allow of Clergy in any case, and therefore in an indictment for murder on the high seas, if the fact cometh out upon evidence to be no more than Man∣slaughter, supposing it to have been committed at land, the prisoner is constantly acquited.</P>
<P>H. Lord Raymond 1496. His Lordship says, "From these cases it appears, that though the law of England, is so far peculiarly favourable (I use the word peculiarly because I know of no other law, that makes such a distinction between Murder and Manslaughter) as to permit the excess of anger and passion (which a man ought to keep under and govern) in some instances to extenuate the greatest of private injuries, as the taking away a man's life is; yet in these cases, it must be such a passion, as for the time deprives him of his reasoning faculties.</P>
<P>I shall not enter into any enquiry, how far the Admiralty sessions in England, or a Special Court of Admiralty in America ought to proceed by the rules of civil law, though it is a question of immense importance to Americans. But must beg leave to observe that though the distinction between Murder and Manslaughter is not found in words in the civil law, yet the distinction between homicide, with deliberation and without deliberation, and on a sudden provocation is well known in that law, and the former is punished with death, the later, with some inferior corporal punishment at the discretion of the Judges.</P>
<P>Indeed, the civil law is more favourable, and indulgent to sudden anger and resent∣ment than the common law, and allows many things to be a provocation sufficient to exempt the person killing from the <HI>Paena ordinaria,</HI> which is death, which the common law considers as a slight provocation or none at all.</P>
<P>Cod. Lib. 9. Tit. 16, Note 40.—Gail, page 503.—Maranta, page 49. Par. 4. Dist. 1.77.</P>
<P>It should seem from these authorities, that the lenity and indulgence of the laws of England, is not unnatural, extraordinary, or peculiar, and instead of being un∣known in the civil law, that it is carried much further in many respects than in the common law.—And indeed it seems that the like indulgence, was permitted in the Iewish law—though it has been so often represented as peculiar to the English law, that many persons seem to think it unwarrantable, and tending to leave the guilt of blood upon the land.</P></NOTE> We have hitherto been considering self-defence, and how far persons may go in defending themselves against aggressors, even by taking away their lives, and now proceed to consider, such provocations as the law allows to mitigate or extenuate the guilt of killing, where it is not justifiable or excusable.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="011683_0083_0F87C803E01FE850"/>An assault and battery, committed upon a man, in such a manner as not to endanger his life, is such a provocation as the law allows to reduce killing, down to the crime of manslaughter. Now the law has been made on more con∣sideration than we are capable of making at present; the law considers a man as capable of bearing any thing, and every thing, but blows I may reproach a man as much as I please, I may call him a thief, robber, traitor, scoundrel, coward, lobster, bloody back, &amp;c. and if he kills me it will be murder, if nothing else but words preceed; but if from giving him such kind of language, I proceed to take him by the nose, or fillip him on the forehead, that is, an assault! that is a blow; the law will not oblige a man to stand still and bear it; there is the distinction; hands off, touch me not; as soon as you touch me, if I run you thro' the heart it is but Manslaughter; the utility of this distincti∣on, the more you think of it, the more you will be satisfi∣ed with it; it is an assault when ever a blow is struck, let
<PB N="166" REF="011683_0084_0F87C804A6BADB20"/>
it be ever so slight, and sometimes even without a blow. The law considers man as frail and passionate, when his passions are touched, he will be thrown off his guard, and therefore the law makes allowances for this frailty, considers him as in a sit of passion, not having the possession of his intellect∣ual faculties, and therefore does not oblige him to measure out his blows with a yard stick, or weigh them in a scale; let him kill with a sword, gun or hedge stake, it is not mur∣der, but only manslaughter. Keyling's Reports 135. <HI>Regina versus</HI> Mawgrige. "Rules supported by authority and ge∣neral consent, shewing what are always allowed to be suf∣ficient provocations. First, if one man, <HI>upon any words shall make an assault</HI> upon another, either by <HI>pulling him by the nose, or filliping upon the forehead,</HI> and he that is so assaulted, shall draw his sword, and immediately run the other through, that is but manslaughter; for the peace is broken by the person killed, and with an indignity to him that received the assault. Besides, he that was so affronted might reasonably apprehend, that he that treated him in that manner, might have some further design upon him." So that here is the boundary, when a man is assaulted, and kills in conse∣quence of that assault, it is but manslaughter; I will just read as I go along the defintion of an assault. 1. Hawkin's Chap. 62. § 1. "An assault is an attempt or offer, with force or violence, to do a coporal hurt to another; as by stricking at him, with or without a weapon, or presenting a gun at him, at such a distance to which the gun will carry, or pointing a pitch-fork at him, or by any other such like act done in an angry, threatning manner, &amp;c. But no words can amount to an assault." Here is the defintion of an assault, which is a sufficient provocation to soften kil∣ling down to manslaughter. 1. Hawkin's, Chap. 31. § 36. "Neither can he be thought guilty of a greater crime, than manslaughter, who finding a man in bed with his wife, or being actually <HI>struck by him,</HI> or <HI>pulled by the nose,</HI> or <HI>filliped upon the forehead,</HI> immediately kills him, or in the defence of his person from an unlawful arrest; or in the defence of his house, from those who claiming a title to it, attempt forcibly to enter it, and to that purpose shoot at it, &amp;c." Every snow-ball, oyster shell, cake of ice, or bit of cinder that was thrown that night, at the Sentinel, was an assault upon him; every one that was thrown at the party of sol∣diers, was an assault upon them, whether it hit any of
<PB N="167" REF="011683_0084_0F87C804A6BADB20"/>
them or not. I am guilty of an assault, if I present a gun at any person, whether I shoot at him or not, it is an assault, and if I insult him in that manner, and he shoots me, it is but manslaughter. Foster, 295 6. "To what I have of∣fered with regard to sudden rencounters, let me add, that the blood, already too much heated, kindleth afresh at eve∣ry pass or blow. And in the tumult of the passions, in which mere instinct self preservation, hath no inconsider∣able share, the voice of reason is not heard. And there∣fore, the law in condesension to the infirmities of flesh and blood doth extenuate the offence." Insolent, scurrilous, or slanderous language, when it preceeds an assault, aggra∣vates it. Foster 316. "We all knew that words of re∣proach, how grating and offensive soever, are in the eye of the law, no provocation, in the case of voluntary homicide, and yet every man who hath considered the human frame, or but attended to the workings of his own heart, knoweth, that affronts of that kind, pierce deeper, and stimulate in the veins more effectually, than a slight injury done to a third person, tho' under colour of justice, possibly can." I produce this to show the assault, in this case, was aggravated by the scur∣rilous language which preceeded it. Such words of reproach, stimulate in the veins, and ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sperate the mind, and no doubt if an assault and battery succeeds them, killing un∣der such a provocation, is softened to manslaughter, but, killing without such provocation, makes it murder.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Honours, and you Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I yesterday afternoon produced from the best authorities, those rules of law which must govern all cases of homicide, particularly that which is now before you; it now remains to consider the evidence, and see whether any thing has occur∣ed, that may be compared to the rules read to you; and I will not trouble myself nor you with laboured endeavours to be methodical, I shall endeavour to make some few ob∣servations, on the testimonies of the witnesses, such as will place the facts in a true point of light, with as much brevity as possible; but I suppose it would take me four hours to read to you, (if I did nothing else but read) the
<PB N="168" REF="011683_0085_0F87C80562B05F00"/>
minutes of evidence that I have taken in this trial. In the first place the Gentleman who opened this cause, has stated to you, with candour and precision, the evidence of the iden∣tity of the persons.</P>
<P>The witnesses are confident that they know the prisoners at the barr, and that they were present that night, and of the party; however, it is apparent, that witnesses are lia∣ble to make mistakes, by a single example before you. Mr. <HI>Bass,</HI> who is a very honest man, and of good character, swears positively that the tall man, <HI>Warren,</HI> stood on the right that night, and was the first that fired; and I am sure you are satisfied by this time, by many circumstances, that he is totally mistaken in this matter; this you will consi∣der at your leisure. The witnesses in general did not know the faces of these persons before; very few of them knew the names of them before, they only took notice of their faces that night. How much certainty there is in this evi∣dence, I leave you to determine.</P>
<P>There does not seem to me to be any thing very material in the testimony of Mr. <HI>Aston,</HI> except to the identity of <HI>M'Cauley,</HI> and he is the only witness to that. If you can be satisfied in your own minds, without a doubt, that he knew <HI>M'Cauley</HI> so well as to be sure, you will believe he was there.</P>
<P>The next witness is <HI>Bridgham,</HI> he says he saw the tall man <HI>Warren,</HI> but saw another man belonging to the same regi∣ment soon after, so like him, as to make him doubt whether it was <HI>Warren</HI> or not; he thinks he saw the <HI>Corporal,</HI> but is not certain, he says he was at the corner of the <HI>Custom house,</HI> this you will take notice of, other witnesses swear, he was the remotest man of all from him who fired first, and there are other evidences who swear the left man did not fire at all; if <HI>Wemms</HI> did not discharge his gun at all, he could not kill any of the persons, therefore he must be acquitted on the fact of killing; for an intention to kill, is not mur∣der nor manslaughter, if not carried into execution: The witness saw numbers of things thrown, and he saw plainly sticks strike the guns, about a dozen persons with sticks, gave three cheers, and surrounded the party, and struck the guns with their sticks several blows: This is a witness for the crown, and his testimony is of great weight for the prisoners; he gives his testimony very sensibly and impar∣tially. He swears positively, that he not only saw ice or snow thrown, but saw the gus struck several times; if you
<PB N="169" REF="011683_0085_0F87C80562B05F00"/>
believe this witness, of whose credibility you are wholly the Judges, as you are of every other; if you do not believe him, there are many others who swear to circumstances in favour of the prisoners; it should seem impossible you should disbelieve so great a number, and of crown witnesses too, who swear to such variety of circumstances that fall in with one another so naturally to form our defence; this witness swears positively, there were a dozen of persons with clubs, surrounded the party; twelve sailors with clubs, were by much an overmatch to eight soldiers, chained there by the order and command of their officer, to stand in defence of the Sentry, not only so, but under an oath to stand there, <HI>i. e.</HI> to obey the lawful command of their officer, as much, Gentlemen of the Jury, as you are under oath to deter∣mine this cause be law and evidence; clubs they had not, and they could not defend themselves with their bayonets against so many people; it was in the power of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailors to kill one half or the whole of the party if they had been so disposed; what had the soldiers to expect, when twelve persons arm∣ed with clubs, (sailors too, between whom and soldiers, there is such an antipathy, that they fight as naturally when they meet, as the elephant and Rhinoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ros) were daring e∣nough, even at the time when they were loading their guns, to come up with their clubs, and smite on their guns; what had eight soldiers to expect from such a set of people? Would it have been a prudent resolution in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, or in a∣ny body in their situation, to have stood still, to see if the sailors would knock their brains out, or not? Had they not all the reason in the world to think, that as they had done so much, they would proceed farther? their clubs were as capable of killing as a ball, an hedge stake is known in the law books as a weapon of death, as much as a sword, bayonet, or musk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. He says, the soldiers were loading their guns, when the twelve surrounded them, the people went up to them within the length of their guns, and before the firing; besides all this he swears, they were called cowardly raseals, and dared to fire; he says these people were all dressed <HI>like</HI> sailors; and I believe, that by and bye you will find evidence enough to satisfy you, these were some of the persons that came out of <HI>Dock∣square,</HI> after making the attack on <HI>Murray's barracks,</HI> and who had been arming themselves with sticks from the butch∣ers stalls and cord wood piles, and marched up round <HI>Corn∣hill</HI>

under the command of <HI>Attucks.</HI> All the bells in town were ringing, the ratling of the blows upon the guns he heard, and swears it was violent this; corroborates the testi∣mony of <HI>James Bailey,</HI> which will be considered presently. Some witnesses swear a club struck a soldier's gun, <HI>Bailey</HI> swears a man struck a soldier and knocked him down, be∣fore he fired, "the last man that fired, levelled at a lad, and moved his gun as the lad ran:" You will consider, that an intention to kill is not murder; if a man lays poison in the way of another, and with an express intention that he should take it up and die of it, it is not murder: Suppose that soldier had malice in his heart, and was d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>termined to murder that boy if he could, yet the evidence clears him of killing the boy, I say, admit he had malice in his heart, yet it is plain he did not kill him or any body else, and if you believe one part of the evidence, you must believe the o∣ther, and if he had malice, that malice was ineffectual; I do not recollect any evidence that assertains who it was that stood the last man but one upon the left, admitting he dis∣covered a temper ever so wicked, cruel and malicious, you are to consider his ill temper is not imputable to another, no other had any intention of this deliberate kind, the whole transaction was sudden, there was but a very short space of time between the first gun and the last, when the first gun was fired the people fell in upon the soldiers and laid on with their weapons with more violence, and this ser∣ved to encrease the provocation, and raised such a violent spirit of revenge in the soldiers, as the law takes notice of, and makes some allowance for, and in that fit of fury and madness, I suppose he aimed at the boy.</P>
<P>The next witness is <HI>Dodge,</HI> he says, there were fifty peo∣ple near the soldiers pushing at them; now the witness be∣fore say, there were twelve sailors with clubs, but now here are fifty more aiding and abetting of them, ready to relieve them in case of need; now what could the people expect? It was their business to have taken themselves out of the way; some prudent people by the <HI>Town-house,</HI> told them not to meddle with the guard, but you hear nothing of this from these fifty people; no, instead of that, they were huzz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing and whistling, crying damn you, fire! why don't you fire? So that they were actually assisting these twelve sailors that made the attack; he says the soldiers were pushing at the people to keep them off, ice and snow∣balls

were thrown, and I heard ice rattle on their guns, there were some clubs thrown from a considerabl distance across the street. This witness swears he saw snow-balls thrown close before the party, and he took them to be thrown on purpose, he saw oyster-shells likewise thrown.— Mr. <HI>Langford</HI> the watchman, is more particular in his testi∣mony, and deserves a very particular consideration, because it is intended by the council for the crown, that his testi∣mony shall distinguish <HI>Killroy</HI> from the rest of the prisoners, and exempt him from those pleas of justification, excuse or ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tation, which we rely upon for the whole party, be∣cause he had previous malice, and they would from hence conclude, he aimed at a particular person; you will consi∣der all the evidence with regard to that, by itself.</P>
<P><HI>Hemmingway,</HI> the sheriff's coachman, swears he knew <HI>Kill∣roy,</HI> and that he heard him say, he would never miss an op∣portunity of si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing upon the inhabitants: this is to prove that <HI>Killroy</HI> had preconceived malice in his heart, not indeed against the unhappy persons who were killed, but against the inhabitants in general, that he had the spirit not only of a <HI>Turk</HI> or an <HI>Arab,</HI> but of the devil; but admitting that this testimony is litterally true, and that he had all the malice they would wish to prove, yet, if he was assaulted that night, and his life in danger, he had a right to defend himself as well as another man; if he had malice before, it does not take away from him the right of defending himself against any unjust aggressor. But it is not at all improbable, that there was some misunderstanding about these loose expressions; perhaps the man had no thoughts of what his words might import; many a man in his cups, or in anger, which is a short fit of madness, hath uttered the rashest expressions, who had no such savage disposition in general: so that there is but little weight in expressions uttered at a kitching fire, before a maid and a coachman, where he might think himself at liberty to talk as much like a bully, a fool, and a madman as he pleased, and that no evil would come of it. Strictly speaking, he might mean no more than this, that he would not miss an opportunity of firing on the inhabitants, if he was attacked by them in such a manner as to justify it: soldiers have sometimes a∣voided opportunities of firing, when they would have been justified, if they had fired. I would recommend to them, to be tender by all means, nay, let them be cautious at their
<PB N="172" REF="011683_0087_0F87C809C6437C30"/>
peril; but still what he said, amounts in strictness, to no more than this, "If the inhabitants make an attack on me, I will not bear from them what I have done already;" or I ill bear no more, than what I am obliged by law to bear. No doubt it was under the fret of his spirits, the indignation, mortification, grief and shame, that he had suffered a de∣feat at the Rope-walks; it was just after an account of an aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y was published here, betwixt the soldiers and inhabitants at <HI>New York.</HI> There was a little before the 5th of <HI>March,</HI> much noise in this town, and a pompuous account in the news papers, of a victory obtained by the inhabitants there over the soldiers; which doubtless excited the resentment of the soldiers here, as well as exultations among some sorts of the inhabitants: and the ringing of the bells here, was probably copied from <HI>New York,</HI> a wretched example in this, and in two other instances at least: the defeat of the soldiers at the Rope-walks, was about that time too, and if he did, after that, use such expressions, it ought not to weigh too much in this case. It can scarcely amount to proof that he harboured any settled malice against the peo∣ple in general. Other witnesses are introduced to show that <HI>Killroy</HI> had besides his general ill will against every body, particular malice against Mr. <HI>Gray,</HI> whom he killed, as <HI>Langford</HI> swears.</P>
<P>Some of the witnesses, have sworn that <HI>Gray</HI> was active in the battle at the Rope walks, and that <HI>Killroy</HI> was once there, from whence the Council for the Crown would infer, that <HI>Killroy</HI>; in <HI>King street,</HI> on the 5th of <HI>March</HI> in the night, kenw <HI>Gray</HI> whom he had seen at the Rope-walks before, and took that opportunity to gratify his preconceived malice; but if this is all true, it will not take away from him his justification, excuse, or extenuation, if he had any.— The rule of the law is, if there has been mallice between two, and at a distant time afterwards they met, and one of them assaults the other's life, or only assaults him, and he kills in consequence of it, the law presumes the killing was in self defence, or upon the provocation, not on ac∣count of the antecedent malice. If therefore the assault upon <HI>Killroy</HI> was so violent as to endanger his life, he had as good a right to defend himself, as much as if he never had before conceived any malice against the people in ge∣ral, or Mr. <HI>Gray</HI> in particular. If the assault upon him, was such as to amount only to a provocation, not to a justi∣fication,
<PB N="173" REF="011683_0087_0F87C809C6437C30"/>
his crime will be manslaughter only. However, it does not appear, that he knew Mr. <HI>Gray</HI>; none of the witnesses pretend to say he knew him, or that he ever saw him. It is true they were both at the Rope-walks at one time, but there were so many combatants on each side, that it is not even probable that <HI>Killroy</HI> should know them all, and no witness says there was any rencounter there between them two. Indeed, to return to Mr. <HI>Langford</HI>'s testimony, he says, he did not perceive <HI>Killroy</HI> to aim at <HI>Gray,</HI> more than at him, but he says expressly, he did not aim at <HI>Gray.</HI> —<HI>Langford</HI> says, "<HI>Gray</HI> had no stick, was standing with his arms folded up,"—This witness, is however most pro∣bably mistaken in this matter and consounds one time with another, a mistake which has been made by many witnesses, in this case, and considering the confusion and terror of the scene, is not to be wondered at—</P>
<P>Witnesses have sworn to the condition of <HI>Killroy's</HI> bayo∣net, that it was bloody the morning after the 5th of <HI>March.</HI> —The blood they saw, if any, might be occasioned by a wound given by some of the bayonets in the affray, possibly in Mr. <HI>Posdick</HI>'s arm, or it might happen, in the manner mentioned by my brother before.—One bayonet at least was struck off and it might fall, where the blood of some person slain afterwards flowed.—It would be doing vio∣lence to every rule of law and evidence, as well as to com∣mon sense and the feelings of humanity, to infer from the blood on the bayonet, that it had been stabbed into the brains of Mr. <HI>Gray</HI> after he was dead, and that by <HI>Killroy</HI> himself who had killed him.</P>
<P>Young Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> swears, that he saw <HI>Gray</HI> that evening, a little before the firing, that he had a stick under his arm, and said he would go to the riot, "I am glad of it, (that is that there was a rumpus) I will go and have a slap at them, if I lose my life."—And when he was upon the spot, some wit∣nesses swear, he did not act that peaceable inoffensive part, which <HI>Langford</HI> thinks he did.—They swear, they thought him in liquor—that he run about clapping several people on the shoulders saying, "Dont run away"—"they dare not fire" <HI>Langford</HI> goes on "I saw twenty or five and twenty boys about the Sentinal—and I spoke to him, and bid him not be afraid."—How came the Watchman <HI>Langford</HI> to tell him not to be afraid. Does not this circumstance prove, that he thought there was danger, or at least that the Sen∣tinel
<PB N="174" REF="011683_0088_0F87C80BDD0F7400"/>
in fact, was terrified and did think himself in danger. <HI>Langford</HI> goes on "I saw about twenty or five and twenty boys that is young shavers."—We have been entertained with a great variety of phrases, to avoid calling this sort of people a mob.—Some call them shavers, some call them genius's. —The plain English is gentlemen, most probably a motley rabble of saucy boys, negroes and molattoes, Irish teagues and out laudish jack tarrs.—And why we should scruple to call such a set of people a mob, I can't conceive, unless the name is too respectable for them:—The sun is not a∣bout to stand still or go out, nor the rivers to dry up be∣cause there was a mob in <HI>Boston</HI> on the 5th of <HI>March</HI> that attacked a party of soldiers.—Such things are not new in the world, nor in the British domi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions though they are comparatively, rareties and novelties in this town.— <HI>Carr</HI> a native of <HI>Ireland</HI> had often been concerned in such attacks, and indeed, from the nature of things, sol∣diers quartered in a populous town, will always occasion two mobs, where they prevent one.—They are wretched conservators of the peace!</P>
<P><HI>Langford</HI> "heard the rattling against the guns, but saw nothing thrown."—This rattling must have been very re∣markable, as so many witnesses heard it, who were not in a situation to see what caused it—These things which hit the guns made a noise, those which hit the soldiers per∣sons, did not—But when so many things were thrown and so many hit their guns, to suppose that none struck their per∣sons is incredible.—<HI>Langford</HI> goes on "<HI>Gray</HI> struck me on the shoulder and asked me what is to pay? I answered, I don't know but I believe someth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng will come of it, by and bye."—Whence could this apprehension of mischief arise, it <HI>L'angford</HI> did not think the assault, the squabble, the affray was such as would provoke the soldiers to fire?—" a bayonet went through my great coat and jacket," yet the soldier did not step out of his place—This looks as if <HI>Lang∣ford</HI> was nearer to the party than became a watchman. For∣ty or fifty people round the soldiers, and more coming from <HI>Quaker lane,</HI> as well as the other lanes—The soldiers heard all the bells ringing and saw people coming from every point of the compass to the assistance of those who were insulting, assaulting, beating and abusing of them— what had they to expect but destruction, if they had not thus early taken measures to defend themselves?</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="011683_0088_0F87C80BDD0F7400"/><HI>Brewer</HI> saw <HI>Killroy,</HI> &amp;c. saw Dr. <HI>Young</HI> &amp;c. "he said the people had better go home." It was an excellent advice, hap∣py for some of them had they followed it but it seems all advice was lost on these persons, they would harken to none that was given them in <HI>Dock square, Royal exchange lane</HI> or <HI>King street,</HI> they were bent on making this assault, and on their own destruction.</P>
<P>The next witness that knows any thing was, <HI>James Bailey,</HI> he saw <HI>Carrol, Montgomery</HI> and <HI>White,</HI> he saw some round the Sentry, heaving pieces of ice, large and hard enough to hurt any man, as big as your fist: one question is whe∣ther the Sentinel was attacked or not.—If you want evi∣dence of an attack upon him there is enough of it, here is a witness an inhabitant of the town, surely no friend to the soldiers, for he was engaged against them at the Rope∣walks; he says he saw twenty or thirty round the Sentry, pelting with cakes of ice, as big as one's fist; certainly cakes of ice of this size may kill a man, if they happen to hit some part of the head.—So that, here was an attack on the Sentinel, the consequence of which he had reason to dread, and it was prudent in him to call for the <HI>Main Guard</HI>: he retreated as far as he could, he attempted to get into the <HI>Custom house,</HI> but could not; then he called to the <HI>Guard,</HI> and he had a good right to call for their assistance; "he did not know, he told the witness, what was the matter," "but he was afraid there would be mischief by and bye;" and well he might, with so many shavers and genius's round him—capable of throwing such dangerous things. <HI>Bailey</HI> swears, <HI>Montgomery</HI> fired the first gun, and that he stood at the right, "the next man to me, I stood behind him, &amp;c" This witness certainly is not prejudiced in favour of the soldiers, he swears, he saw a man come up to <HI>Montgomery</HI> with a club, and knock him down before he fired, and that he not only fell himself, but his gun flew out of his hand, and as soon as he rose he took it up and fired. If he was knocked down on his station, had he not reason to think his life in danger, or did it not raise his passions and put him off his guard; so that it cannot be more than manslaughter.</P>
<P>When the multitude was shouting and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uzza<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, and threatning life, the bells all ringing, the mob whistle screaming and rending like an Indian yell, the people from all quarters throwing every species of rubbish they could pick up in the street, and some who were quite
<PB N="176" REF="011683_0089_0F87C80C6A4CCBE0"/>
on the other side of the street throwing clubs at the whole party, <HI>Montgomery</HI> in particular, smote with a club and knocked down, and as soon as he could rise and take up his firelock, another club from a far struck his b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east or shoulder, what could he do? Do you expect he should behave like a Stoick Philosopher lost in Apathy? Patient as <HI>Epictatus</HI> while his master was breaking his leggs with a cud∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>?—It is impossible you should find him guilty of mur∣der. You must suppose him divested of all human passions, if you don't think him at the least provoked, thrown off his guard, and into the <HI>surer brevis,</HI> by such treatment as this.</P>
<P><HI>Bailey</HI> "Saw the Molatto seven or eight minutes before the firing, at the head of twenty or thirty sailors in <HI>Corn∣hill,</HI> and he had a large cordwood stick." So that this <HI>At∣tucks,</HI> by this testimony of <HI>Bailey</HI> compared with that of <HI>Andrew,</HI> and some others, appears to have undertaken to be the hero of the night; and to lead this army with ban∣ners, to form them in the first place in <HI>Dock square,</HI> and march them up to <HI>King-street,</HI> with their club<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; they passed through the main street up to the <HI>Main guard,</HI> in order to make the attack. If this was not an unlawful assembly, there never was one in the world. <HI>Attucks</HI> with his myrmidous comes round <HI>Jockson</HI>'s corner, and down to the party by the Sentry-box; when the soldiers pushed the people off, this man with his party cried, do not be afraid of them, they dare not fire, kill them! kill them! knock them over! And he tried to knock their brains out. It is plain the soldiers did not have their station, but cried to the people, stand off: now to have this reinforcement coming down under the command of a stout Molatto f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow, whose very looks, was enough to terrify any person, what had not the sol∣diers then to fear? He had hardiness enough to fall in up∣on them, and with one hand took hold of a bayonet, and with the other knocked the man down: This was the be∣haviour of <HI>Attucks</HI>;—to whose mad behaviour, in all pro∣bability, the dreadful carnage of that night, is chiefly to be ascribed. And it is in this manner, this town has been often treated; a <HI>Carr</HI> from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and an <HI>Attucks</HI> from <HI>Framingham,</HI> happening to be here, shall sully out upon their thoughtless enterprizes, at the head of such a rabble of Negroes, &amp;c. as they can collect together, and then there are not wanting, persons to ascribe all their doings to the good people of the town.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="011683_0089_0F87C80C6A4CCBE0"/>Mr. <HI>Adams</HI> proceeded to a minute consideration of every witness produced on the crown side; and endeavoured to shew, from the evidence on that side, which could not be contested by the council for the crown, that the assault up∣on the party, was sufficiently dangerous to justify the pri∣soners; at least, that it was sufficiently provoking, to reduce to manslaughter the crime, even of the two who were sup∣posed to be proved to have killed. But it would swell this publication too much, to insert his observations at large, and there is the less necessity for it, as they will probably occur to every man who re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds the evidence with attention He then proceeded to consider the testimonies of the witnesses for the prisoners, which must also be omitted: And concuded,</P>
<P>I will enlarge no more on the evidence, but submit it to you.—Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence: nor is the law less stable than the fact; if an assault was made to endan∣ger their lives, the law is clear, they had a right to kill in their own defence; it it was not so severe as to endanger their lives, yet if they were assaulted at all, struck and abu∣sed by blows of any sort, by snow-balls, oyster-shells, cin∣ders clubs, or sticks of any kind; this was a provocation, for which the law reduces the offence of killing, down to man∣slaughter, in consideration of those passions in our nature, which cannot be eradicated. To your candour and justice I submit the prisoners and their cause.</P>
<P>The law, in all vicissitudes of government, fluctuations of the passions, or flights of enthusiasm, will preserve a steady undeviating course; it will not bend to the uncertain wishes, imaginations, and wanton tempers of men. To use the words of a great and worthy man, a patriot, and an he∣ro, an enlightned friend of mankind, and a martyr to li∣berty: I mean ALGERNOON SIDNEY, who from his earliest infancy sought a tranquil retirement under the shadow of the tree of liberty, with his tongue, his pen, and his sword,
<Q>The law, (says he,) no passion can disturb. 'Tis void of desire and fear, lust and anger. 'Tis <HI>means sine affectu</HI>; written reason; retaining some measure of the divine perfection. It does not enjoin that which pleases a weak, frail man, but without any regard to persons, commands that which is good, and punishes evil in all, whether rich, or poor, high or low,—'Tis deaf, inexorable, inflexible.</Q>
<PB N="178" REF="011683_0090_0F87C80CDE046708"/>
On the one hand it is inexorable to the cries and lamen∣tations of the prisoners; on the other it is deaf, deaf as an adder to the clamou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the populace.</P>
<P>[<HI>The cause was then closed by</HI> Robert Treat Paine, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> <HI>on the part of the crown: In his argument, he endeavoured to settle the principal facts, by comparing the evidence as well on the part of the crown as of the prisoners; and also to sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, that the many undeniable rules of law, which had been produced, did not apply to the cause at bar. And further, that even upon a supposition, the party had a right to go to the relief of the Sentry, in the man∣ner testified by the witnesses; yet from their conduct in going down to the Sentry, and behaviour while there, the law would consider them as an unlawful assembly.

<P>If these determinations appear new and extraordina∣ry to you, it is not to be wondered at, considering the doctrines that of late have been advanced and pro∣pagated among you. In the course of this year you doubt∣less have heard much of the law given to the <HI>Jews,</HI> respect∣ing homicide, as well as of the precept given to <HI>Noah,</HI> that "Whoso shedeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." Whence it has been inferred, that whoever <HI>vo∣luntarily</HI> kills another, whatever the inducement, or provo∣cation may be, is a <HI>murderer,</HI> and as such ought to be put to death. But surely not only the avenger of blood, and he who killed a thief breaking up an house in the night, were exceptions to that general precept, but also he who killed another in his own defence. Even the Jewish Doctors al∣lowed this▪<NOTE N="(z)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Hale,</HI> 4.</NOTE> and that justly; because the right of self-de∣fence is founded in the law of nature, The <HI>Jews</HI> Indeed, suppos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d their law equally subjected to death, him who kil∣led another whether of malice aforethought, or on a sudden fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling out: but it seems the early christian divines did not, for the Clergy in the reign of <HI>Canute,</HI> the beginning of the eleventh century, so conserued the <HI>Mosaical</HI> law as to deem him a muderer, who in time past had conceived hatred a∣gainst his neighbour and lain in wait for him and killed him, and him guilty of manslaughter only who killed an∣other on suden provocation; and it is ordained by one of the laws of this <HI>Canute,</HI> that if any person shall with preme∣ditation kill another he shall be openly delivered up to the kindred of the slain, but if the killing be not with pre∣meditation the Bishop shall take cognizance of it.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ca.

according to the particular circumstances that attended the killing.</P>
<P>These determinations of the King's Courts, for so many ages past, shew, not only what the common law in cases of this kind is, but that these rules of the common law, are the result of the wisdom and experience of many ages.— However it is not material in the present case, whether the common law is agreeable to, or variant from, the law giv∣en to the <HI>Jews,</HI> because it is certain, the prisoners are not in this Court to be tried by <HI>that</HI> law, but by the common law, that is according to the settled and established rules, and antient customs of the nation, approved for successions of ages.</P>

<P>To what has been said under this head I must add, that in the trial of this case, both the Court and Jury are as much obliged to observe these rules, as a Court and Jury in <HI>England</HI> would be in the trial of a like case there; the law in these respects is the same here, as there.

it from what has been said by people out of Court, or, published in the news-papers, or delivered from the pulpits.</P>
<P>Having premised these things, I shall observe to you, the several questions that arise in this case; and point out to you the manner in which I think they may be best consider∣ed and determined.</P>
<P>The principal questions are these, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Whether the five persons said to be murdered, were in fact killed? And if so.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Whether they, or either of them were killed by the prisoners, or either of them? And if they were, then</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Whether such killing was justifiable, excusable, or felouious? And if the latter,</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Whether it was manslaughter or murder?</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As to the first, you have not only the corouer's inquest, but the testimony of so many witnesses, that the five persons were shot and thereby mortally wounded in the night of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> last, and that some of them died instantly, and the rest in a few days after, that you doubtless will be satisfied they were all killed. And the same evidence must I think also convince you, that they were all killed by the party of soldiers that were at the <HI>Custom-house</HI> that night, or by some of them.</P>
<P>Whether the prisoners were there, will therefore be your next enquiry; for if either of them was not, he must be ac∣quitted. You have the testimony of <HI>Bridgham</HI> and <HI>Simpson</HI> as to <HI>Wemms</HI>; of <HI>Danbrooke</HI> and <HI>Simpson</HI> as to <HI>Hartegan,</HI> of <HI>Austin</HI> as to <HI>M'Cauley</HI>; of <HI>Simpson, Langford. Bailey</HI> and <HI>Clark</HI> as to <HI>White</HI>; of <HI>Archibaid, Langford</HI> and <HI>Brewer</HI> as to <HI>Killroy</HI>; of <HI>Dodge</HI> and <HI>Simpson</HI> as to <HI>Warren</HI>; and of <HI>Bailey, Bass, Palmes, Danbrooks</HI> and <HI>Wilkinson</HI> as to <HI>Montgomery</HI>'s being at the <HI>Cus∣tom house</HI> that night, and of the party of soldiers that was there; and this is not contested with any opposite proof.— The law doth not in this case make the testimony of two witnesses necessary for the Jury to settle a fact upon: If one swears it, and upon his testimony you believe it, that is sufficient evidence for you to find the fact. But if you are satisfied upon the evidence, that all the prisoners were there, yet, as each prisoner is severally charged with having killed these five persons, and by his plea has denied the charge, you must be fully satisfied upon the evidence given you, with regard to each prisoner, that he in particular,
<PB N="188" REF="011683_0095_0F87C814D3744150"/>
did <HI>in fact,</HI> or <HI>in consideration of law,</HI> kill one or more of these persons that were slain, or he must be acquitted.</P>
<P>The way therefore to determine this, will be for you to name some one of the prisoners, and then consider, whe∣ther it appears upon the evidence in the case, that he did <HI>in fact</HI> kill <HI>Maverick?</HI> And then, whether upon the evi∣dence it appears, he <HI>in fact</HI> killed <HI>Gray?</HI> And so enquire in the same manner, whether he did <HI>in fact</HI> kill either of the other three persons? And having noted how it appears up∣on the evidence with regard to him; you must then pro∣ceed in like manner with each of the other prisoners; and if upon a full consideration of the evidence in the case, you should be in doubt, as to any one of the prisouers having <HI>in fact</HI> killed either of the persons that were slain, you must consider whether he did it <HI>in consideration of law?</HI> Now all that are present, aiding and abetting one person in killing another, do, in judgment of law, kill him. The stroke of one is, in consideration of law, the stroke of all. When a num∣ber of persons assemble together to do an unlawful act, and in prosecution of that design, one of them kills a man, all the rest of the company are in law considered as abetting him to do it.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1. <HI>Hale.</HI> 440, 1. <HI>Fost.</HI> 351,</NOTE></P>
<P>You must therefore enquire how, and for what purpose, the prisoners came together at the <HI>Custom house,</HI> and what they did there before these person were killed?</P>
<P>The Council for the prisoners say, that, if they were at the <HI>Custom-house</HI> that night, they went there by order of the <HI>Captain</HI> of the <HI>Main-guard,</HI> to support and protect the Sentry, who was insulted, assaulted and abused by a considerable number of people, assembled for that purpose; but as this is denied by the Council for the Crown, it will be pro∣per to consider whether, a Sentry was duly placed at the <HI>Custom-house?</HI> And if so, whether he was attacked? And if so, whether the prisoners went by order of the <HI>Captain,</HI> to support and protect him?</P>
<P>That a Sentry was in fact then placed at the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> by order of Colonel <HI>Dairymple,</HI> the Commanding Officer, as also that one had been placed there for a long time be∣fore, is testified by Capts. <HI>O' Hara,</HI> and <HI>Mason,</HI> and indeed the right to place Sentries, (it being in time of peace) is the only thing that has been questioned. Upon this, there∣fore
<PB N="189" REF="011683_0095_0F87C814D3744150"/>
I would observe, that as the main design of society, is the protection of individuals by the united strength of the whole community; so for the sake of unanimity, strength and dispatch, the supreme executive power is by the British constitution vested in a single person, the King or Queen. This single person has the sole power of raising fleets or ar∣mies; and the Statute of 13 <HI>Car</HI> 2. c. 6. declares, That within all his Majesty's realms and <HI>dominions,</HI> the sole su∣preme government, command and <HI>disposition</HI> of the militia, and of <HI>all forces</HI> by sea and land, and <HI>all sorts</HI> and <HI>places of strength</HI> is, and by the law of <HI>England</HI> ever was, the un∣doubted right of his Majesty and his royal Predecessors, Kings and Queens of <HI>England.</HI> And as <HI>Charles</HI> the Second had this right as King of <HI>England,</HI> it of course comes to his successors, and our present Soverereign Lord the King, now hath it.</P>
<P>Indeed the Bill of Rights declares among other things, That the raising or keeping a standing army, within the kingdom, in a time of peace, unless with the consent of Parliament, is against law. And it is said, that upon the same principles whereon that declaration was founded, it is alike unlawful to be doue in any other part of the King's dominious. But be that as it may, the Mutiny Acts annu∣ally made, shew the consent of Parliament, that the King in time of peace should keep up a standing army not only in the Kingdom, but in <HI>America</HI> also. They not only ascer∣tain the number of troops that shall be kept up, but pro∣vide for the regulation of such of the King's troops as are in <HI>America.</HI> And therefore as by these acts the King is im∣powered to keep up these troops, and he, by common law, has the command and disposition of all forces by sea and land within his dominions, and is the principal conservator of the peace, he doubtless, well might send such part of those troops to this part of his dominions, in order to re∣store the public peace, or to aid and assist the civil Magis∣trate in preserving of it, as he judged necessary for the purpose; and if you should think there was no occasion for sending any troops here, for either of those purposes, that will not alter the case, because the King being the proper judge in that matter, the validity of his order will not de∣pend upon the truth of the representations whereon it is founded. The acts not only fix the number of troops to be kept up, but also establish a law martial for their govern∣ment.
<PB N="190" REF="011683_0096_0F87C815D6C85DF0"/>
Among other things, the Acts subject every officer or soldier that sleeps on his post, or leaves it before he is re∣lieved, or disobeys the <HI>lawful</HI> command of his superior of∣ficer, to such punishment as a Court Martial shall inflict,— though it extend to death itself. These troops are, and e∣ver since they came here, have been under this martial law, and subject to as strict regulation, as in time of war. Plac∣ing Sentries is a necessary part of the regulation of our ar∣my, accordingly a Sentry hath in fact been kept at the <HI>Cus∣tom-house,</HI> ever since the troops have been here; and it is sworn, by the Captains <HI>O' Hara</HI> and <HI>Mason,</HI> that it was done by order of the Commanding Officer. If so, you have no reason to doubt but that it was legally done.</P>
<P>Your next enquiry then will be, whether the Sentry so placed at the <HI>Custom house</HI> was attacked? Many witnesses have sworn that he was. But the Council for the Crown say, the contrary appears by the testimony of Col. <HI>Marshal</HI> and others.</P>
<P>It is with you to determine this matter upon the whole of the evidence given you. In doing it you ought to recon∣cile the several testimonies, if by any reasonable constructi∣on of the words it may be done.— Where some witnesses swear they saw such a thing done, and others swear they were present and did not see it: if the thing said to be done be such as it may reasonably be supposed some might see and others not, by reason of their want of observation, or particular attention to other matters there, as both may be true, you ought to suppose them to be so, rather than pre∣sume that any of the witnesses swear falsly. But if witnes∣ses contradict each other, so that their testimonies cannot be reconciled, you must then consider the number of the witnesses on each side, their ability, integrity, indifference as to the point in question, and the probability or improbability arising from the nature of the thing in question, and upon the whole settle the fact as you verily believe it to be. If you find the Sentry was attacked, the next thing to be con∣sidered is, whether the prisoners went to protect him, and it so, whether it was lawful for them so to do. There is a great difference between a common affray, and attacking the King's forces. I think the law in that regard ought to be more generally known here than it seems to be. If up∣on a sudden quarrel from some affront given or taken, the neighbourhood rise and drive the King's forces out of their

quarters, it is a great misdemeanor, and if death ensues it may be felony in the assailants, but it is not treason, be∣cause <HI>there was no intention against the King's person or govern∣ment:</HI> But attacking the King's forces <HI>in opposition to his au∣thority,</HI> upon a march or in quarters, is levying war against the King.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foster</HI> 219.</NOTE> And resisting the King's forces, <HI>if sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to keep the peace, may</HI> amount to an overact of high treason.<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">4 <HI>Black.</HI> 147.</NOTE> Though it may be attended with great inconveniences for private persons, without a peace officer, to make use of arms for suppressing an ordinary riot, yet if the riot be such an one as savours of rebellion, it doubtless may lawfully be done. <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Haw.</HI> 65. § 11.</NOTE> You have heard what the witnesses deposed re∣specting the resolution taken to drive the soldiers out of town, "<HI>because they had no business here.</HI>" You have also heard what has been testified of the proposals to <HI>attack</HI> the <HI>Main-guard</HI>—of the assembling of the people especially in <HI>Dock-square</HI>—of the huzzaing for the <HI>Main guard</HI> and <HI>King∣street</HI> — and of the attacking the Sentry. Now if this was done in pursuance of a resolution taken "to drive the soldiers out of the town, <HI>because they had no business here.</HI>" I will not now determine whether it was treason or not; but it certainly was a riot that savoured of rebellion; for the suppressing whereof, private persons might not only <HI>arm</HI> themselves, but make use of their arms, if they could not otherwise suppress it.<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Haw.</HI> 65. § 11.</NOTE> Much more might the <HI>Captain</HI> of the <HI>Main guard</HI> take part of the <HI>guard,</HI> armed as usual, and go with them to protect the Sentry By what <HI>Crookshanks, Benjamin Davis, Whitington,</HI> and others have sworn, it seems the Sentry not only called to the <HI>Main guard</HI> for assistance, but two men went and told them they must send assistance directly or the Sentry would be murdered Whereupon the <HI>Captain</HI> gave orders that a party should go to the assistance of the Sentry, and they were drawn out accordingly, led down to the <HI>Custom house</HI> by a <HI>Corporal,</HI> and followed by the <HI>Cap∣tain.</HI> Now as this party did not assemble, or go there, of their own accord, but were sent by their <HI>Captain</HI> to protect the Sentry, it must be supposed <HI>that</HI> was their design in go∣ing until the contrary appears. And although <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon the evidence you should not be satisfied that the Sentry was at∣tacked in pursuance of a resolution taken <HI>to drive the soldi∣ers
<PB N="192" REF="011683_0097_0F87C815DFCB38A0"/>
out of town, because they had no business here,</HI> yet consider∣ing the notice given by the two men to the <HI>Captain,</HI> of the danger the Sentry was in, and what the <HI>Captain</HI> himself might then see and observe of the attack upon the Sentry, (if any regard is to be had to what a great number of the witnesses have sworn) he well might order out such a party, and go with them to protect the Sentry: And it seems to be agreed that if the prisoners were at the <HI>Custom-house</HI> that night, all of them, except the Sentry, were of that party. It has been said that this party of soldiers, when on their march, pushed <HI>Fosdick</HI> with a bayonet while he was stand∣ing peaceably in the street, and struck <HI>Brower</HI> as soon as they got to the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> which shewed their design was to disturb the peace, and not to preserve it. But as <HI>Fosdick</HI> himself says, that, upon his refusing to move out of his place, they parted and went by him, you will consider whether it is not more reasonable to suppose, that what he calls a push was an accidental touch owing to the numbers in the street, rather than any thing purposely done to hurt him; and so with regard to the blow said to be given to <HI>Brewer.</HI> But supposing the push purposely given by one of the party, and the blow by him or another of them, it will by no means be sufficient to prove a design in the whole party, to disturb the peace, nor will all of them be involv∣ed in the guilt of one or more of them that broke the peace, unless they <HI>actually</HI> aided or abetted him or them that did it; because they were assembled and sent forth for a diffe∣rent purpose, and a lawful one.<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foster</HI> 354<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> But if they were a lawful assembly when they got to the <HI>Custom house,</HI> yet if afterwards they all agreed to do an unlawful act to the dis∣turbance of the peace, and in prosecution of that design <HI>Maverick</HI> and the rest were killed, all that party will by law be chargeable with each mortal stroke given by either of them, as though they all had in fact given it.</P>
<P>And it is said, that while they were at the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> before they fired, some of them attempted with their bayo∣nets to stab every one they could come at, without any rea∣son at all for so doing. Such conduct to be sure can nei∣ther be justified nor excused. But as the time was so very short, and some of the witnesses declare the people were crouding upon the soldiers, and that they were moving
<PB N="192" REF="011683_0097_0F87C815DFCB38A0"/>
their guns backwards and forwards crying stand off, stand off, without moving from their station, you will consider whether this may not be what other witnesses call an at∣tempt to stab the people. But, be that as it may, if the party was a lawful assembly before, this not being the act of the whole, would not make it unlawful. The Council for the Crown insist that the firing upon the people was an unlawful act, in disturbance of the peace, and as the par∣ty fired so near together, it must be supposed they previous∣ly agreed to do it; that agreement made them an unlawful assembly, if they were not so before, and being so when they fired, all are chargeable with the killing by any one or more of them. However just this reasoning may be, where there is no apparent cause for their firing, yet it will not hold good where there is. If each of the party had been at the same instant so assaulted, as that it would have justified his killing the ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilant in defence of his own life, and thereupon each of them had at that same instant fired up∣on and killed the person that assaulted him, surely it would not have been evidence of a previous agreement to fire, or prove them to be an unlawful assembly; nor would it have been evidence of such agreement if the attack was not such as would justify the firing and killing, though it was such an assault as would alleviate the offence, and reduce it to manslaughter, since there would be <HI>as ap∣parent</HI> a cause of the firing in one case as in the other, and though not <HI>so good</HI> a cause, yet such an one as the law, in condescension to human frailty greatly regards.— You will therefore carefully consider what the several wit∣nesses have sworn, with regard to the assault made upon the party of soldiers at the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> and if you thereupon believe they were, before, and at the time of their firing attacked by such numbers, and in such a violent manner, as many of the witnesses have positively sworn, you will be able to assign a cause for their firing so near together, as they did, without supposing a previous agreement so to do. But it is said that if their firing as they did, don't prove a previous agreement to do it, yet it is good evidence of an actual abetment to fire, as one by firing encourages the o∣thers to do the like. As neither of the soldiers fired more than once, it is evident that he who fired last, could not thereby in fact, abet or encourage the firing of any of those who fired before him, and so it cannot be evidence of
<PB N="193" REF="011683_0098_0F87C8169D3A0670"/>
such abetment. And if he who fired first and killed, can justify it, because it was lawful for him so to do, surely that same lawful act cannot be evidence of an unlawful abetment. And though he who first fired and killed, may not be able to justify the doing it, yet if it appears he had such a cause for the killing as will reduce it to Manslaugh∣ter, it would be strange indeed if that same act should be evidence of his abetting another who killed without provo∣cation, so as to make him who fired first guilty of murder. The same may be said as to all the intermediate firings: and, as the evidence stands, I don't think it necessary to say how it would be in case the first person fired with little or no provocation. If therefore this party of soldiers, when at the <HI>Custom house,</HI> were a lawful assembly and continued so until they fired, and their firing was not an actual <HI>unlawful</HI> abetment of each other to fire, nor evidence of it, they cannot be said to have <HI>in consideration of law</HI> killed those five persons or either of them, but it must rest on the evidence of the actual killing: and, if so, neither of the prisoners can be found guilty thereof, unless it appears not only that he was of the party, but that he in particular <HI>in fact</HI> did kill one or more of the persons slain. That the five persons were killed by the party of soldiers or some of them, seems clear upon the evidence, and indeed is not disputed.</P>
<P>Some witnesses have been produced to prove that <HI>Montgo∣mery</HI> killed <HI>Attucks</HI>; and <HI>Langford</HI> swears <HI>Kulroy</HI> killed <HI>Gray,</HI> but none of the witnesses undertake to say that either of the other prisoners in particular killed either of the other three persons, or that all of them did it. On the contrary it seems that one of the six did not fire, and that another of them fired at a boy as he was running down the street, but missed him (if he had killed him, as the evidence stands, it would have been murder) but the witnesses are not a∣greed as to the person who fired at the boy, or as to him who did not fire at all. It is highly probable, from the places where the five persons killed fell and their wounds, that they were killed by the discharge of five several guns only. If you are upon the evidence, satisfied of that, and al∣so that <HI>Montgomery</HI> killed <HI>Attucks,</HI> and <HI>Killroy Gray,</HI> it will thence follow that the other three, were killed, not by the other six prisoners, but by three of them only: and there∣fore they cannot all be found guilty of it. And as the evi∣dence does not shew which three killed the three, nor that
<PB N="194" REF="011683_0098_0F87C8169D3A0670"/>
either of the six in particular killed either of the three, you cannot find either of the six guilty of killing them or either them <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Hale</HI> 442.</NOTE> If you are satisfied, upon the evidence gi∣ven you, that <HI>Montgomery</HI> killed <HI>Attucks,</HI> you will proceed to inquire whether it was justifiable, excusable, or felonious homicide, and it the latter whether it was maliciously done or not. As he is charged with murder, if the fact of killing be proved, all the circumstances of <HI>necessity</HI> or <HI>infirmity</HI> are to be satisfactorily proved by him, unless they arise out of the evidence produced against him, for the law presumeth the fact to have been founded in malice untill the contrary ap∣pears.<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foster</HI> 255.</NOTE></P>
<P>You will therefore, carefully consider and weigh the whole of the evidence given you respecting the attack, made upon the party of soldiers <HI>in general,</HI> and upon <HI>Mont∣gomery</HI> in particular. In doing it, you will observe the rules I have before mentioned, and not forget the part that some of the witnesses took in this unhappy affair, and if upon the whole it appears to you, that <HI>Montgomery</HI> was attacked, in such a violent manner, as that his life was in immediate danger, or that he had sufficient reason to think it was, and he thereupon fired and killed <HI>Attucks,</HI> for the preservation of his own life, it was justifiable homicide; and he ought to be acquitted.—If you do not believe that was, the case, but upon the evidence are satisfied, that he was by that as∣sembly, assaulted with clubs and other weapons, and there∣upon fired at the rioters and killed <HI>Attucks</HI>: then you ought to find him guilty of manslaughter only. But if upon the evidence you believe, that <HI>Montgomery,</HI> without being previ∣ously assaulted, fired, and killed <HI>Attucks</HI>: then you will find him guilty of muder But you must know, that if this party of soldiers <HI>in general</HI> were pelted, with snow-balls, pieces of ice and sticks, <HI>in anger,</HI> this, without more, amounts to an assault, not only upon those that were in fact struck, but upon the whole party; and is such an assault as will reduce the killing to manslaughter. And if you believe, what some of the witnesses have sworn, that the people a∣round the soldiers, and many of them armed with clubs, crouded upon the soldiers, and with the cry of, "Rush on, Kill them, Kill them, Knock them over," did in fact rush on, strike at them with their clubs, and give <HI>Montgomery</HI>
<PB N="195" REF="011683_0099_0F87C8176229D1B0"/>
such a blow, as to knock him down, as some of the witnes∣ses say, or to make him sally, or stagger, as others say—it will be sufficient to show, that his life was in immediate danger, or that he had sufficient reason to think so.</P>
<P>It seems, a doctrine, has of late been advanced, "that soldiers while on duty, may upon <HI>no occasion whatever</HI> fire upon their fellow subjects, without the order of a civil magistrate." This may possibly account, for some of those who attacked the solders, saying to them, "You dare not fire, we know you dare not fire."—But it ought to be known, that the law doth not countenance such an absurd doctrine. A man by becoming a soldier, doth not thereby lose the right of self-defence which is founded in the law of nature. Where any one is, without his own default, reduced to such circumstances, as that the laws of society cannot avail him, the law considers him, "as <HI>still in that instance</HI> under the protection of the law of nature."<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Foster</HI> 274, 5.</NOTE> This rule extends to soldiers as well as others; nay, while soldiers are in the immediate service of the King, and the regular discharge of their duty, they rather come within the <HI>reason,</HI> of civil officers and their assistants, and so are a∣like under the <HI>peculiar</HI> protection of the law.</P>
<P>If you are satisfied upon the evidence, that <HI>Killroy</HI> killed <HI>Gray,</HI> you will then enquire, whether it was justifiable, ex∣cusable or felonious homicide, and if the latter, whether it was with, or without malice. If the attack was upon the party of soldiers <HI>in general,</HI> and in the manner I have just mentioned, as some of the witnesses say it was, it is equal∣ly an assault upon all, whether all were in fact struck, or not, and makes no material difference, as to their respec∣tive right of firing: for a man is not obliged to wait un∣til he is killed, or struck, before he makes use of the neces∣sary means of self defence. If the blows with clubs were, by an enraged multitude, aimed at the party <HI>in gene∣ral,</HI> each one might reasonably think his own life in dan∣ger; for though he escaped the first blow, he might rea∣sonably expect more would follow, and could have no as∣surance, that he should be so fortunate as to escape all of them.</P>
<P>And therefore, I do not see but that <HI>Killroy</HI> is upon the same sooting with <HI>Montgomery;</HI> and your verdict must be
<PB N="196" REF="011683_0099_0F87C8176229D1B0"/>
the same as to both, unless what <HI>Hemmingway</HI> swears <HI>Killroy</HI> said, or the affray at the Rope-walk, or both, materially vary the case. <HI>Hemmingway</HI> swears, that he and <HI>Killroy</HI> were talking about the town's people and the soldiers, and that <HI>Killroy</HI> said. "He never would miss an opportunity, when he had one, to fire on the inhabitants, and that he had wanted to have an opportunity, ever since he landed." But he says, he cannot remember what words immediately preceded or followed, or at what particular time the words were uttered, nor does he know whether <HI>Killroy</HI> was jocu∣lar, or not. If the witness is not mistaken as to the words, the speech was at least, very imprudent and foolish. How∣ever, if <HI>Killroy,</HI> either in Jest or in earnest, uttered those words, yet if the assault upon him was such, as would jus∣tify his firing and killing, or alleviate it so as to make it but manslaughter, that will not inhance the killing to mur∣der. And though it has been sworn that <HI>Killroy</HI> and other soldiers, had a quarrel with <HI>Gray</HI> and others, at the Rope∣walk, a few days before the 5th <HI>March,</HI> yet it is not certain that <HI>Killroy</HI> then knew <HI>Gray,</HI> or armed at him in particular: But if <HI>Gray</HI> encouraged the assault by clapping the assail∣ants on their backs, as <HI>Hink<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey</HI> swears he did, and <HI>Killroy</HI> saw this and knew him to be one of those that were concerned in the affray at the Rope walk, this very circumstance would have a natural tendency, to raise <HI>Killroy</HI>'s passions, and throw him off his guard, much more than if the same things had been done by another person.—In the tumult of passion the voice of reason is not heard, and it is owing to the allowance the law makes for human frailty, that all unlawful voluntary homicide is not deemed mur∣der. If there be "malice between A and B, and they meet casually, A assaults B, and drives him to the wall, B in in his own defence kills A, this is <HI>se defendendo,</HI> and shall not be heightened by the former malice, into murder or homicide at large, for it was not a killing upon the account of the former malice, but upon a necessity im∣posed upon him by the assault of A▪"<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Hale</HI> 479.</NOTE> So upon the same principle, where the assault is such as would make the kil∣ling but manslaughter, if there had been no previous quar∣rel, the killing ought to be attributed to the assault, unless the evidence clearly shews the contrary: an <HI>assault</HI> being
<PB N="197" REF="011683_0100_0F87C8182C4271C0"/>
known and allowed by law to be <HI>a provocation</HI> to kill, that will free the party from the guilt of murder; whereas nei∣ther words of reproach, nor actions expressive of contempt, "are <HI>a prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cation</HI> to use such violence,"<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Kely.</HI> 131. <HI>Foster</HI> 290.</NOTE> that is, the law doth not allow them to be, <HI>without an assault,</HI> such <HI>a provoca∣tion</HI> as will excuse the killing, or make it any thing less than murder.</P>
<P>Upon the same principle, where the assault is such, as makes the killing manslaughter, the killing ought to be at∣tributed to the assault, unless the evidence clearly shows the contrary.</P>
<P>This meeting of <HI>Killroy</HI> and <HI>Gray</HI> was casual upon the part of <HI>Killroy</HI> at least; he was lawfully ordered to the place where he <HI>was</HI> and had no right to quit his station without the leave of Capt. <HI>Pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI>; nor were any of the party o∣bliged to retreat and give way to the rioters, but might lawfully stand, and repel force by force.</P>
<P>It is needless for me to say what you ought to do with regard to the other six prisoners, in case they had gone to the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> not to protect the Sentry, but to disturb the peace, or after they got there and before the firing had agreed so to do; or in case they had <HI>actually</HI> un∣lawfully abetted the killing: because none of these things have been testified, nor can any of them be deduced from any thing which has been given to you in evidence.</P>
<P>Having already said much more upon this occasion, than I should have thought necessary in a like case, at any other time, I shall add no more.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS is the most solemn trial I ever sat in judgment up∣on. It is of great importance to the community in gene∣ral, and of the last importance to the prisoners at the bar. I have noticed your patience and attention during the course of the trial, which have been highly commendable and seem to have been adequate to the importance of the cause.</P>
<P>The occasion of this trial is the loss of <HI>five</HI> of our fellow-subjects, who were killed on the evening of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> last: whether the prisoners at the bar are charge∣able

with their death or not, it is nevertheless our part to adore the divine conduct in this unhappy catastrophe, and to justify the ways of GOD to Man.</P>
<P>Here are <HI>eight</HI> prisoners at the bar who are charged with the murder of those <HI>five</HI> persons, and whose lives or deaths depend upon your verdict. They are soldiers, but you are to remember that they are fellow-subjects also. Soldiers, when they act properly in their department, are an useful set of men in society. and indeed, in some cases, they are more useful than any other members of society, as we hap∣pily experienced in the late war, by the reduction of <HI>Cana∣da,</HI> whereby our liberties and properties have been happily secured to us: and soldiers, Gentlemen, are under the pro∣tection of the same laws equally with any other of his Ma∣jesty's subjects.</P>
<P>There have been attempts to prejudice the minds of the good people of this province against the prisoners at the bar, and I cannot help taking notice of one in particular, (which included also an insult on this Court) published in one of the Weekly Papers the day before this trial was to have come on. I think I never saw greater mali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nity of heart expressed in any one piece; a malignity blacker than ever was expressed by the savages of the wilderness, for they are in the untutored state of nature and are their own aven∣gers of wrongs done to them; but we are under the laws of society, which laws are the avengers of wrongs done to us: I am sorry I am obliged to say it, but there are persons among us who have endeavoured to bring this Supreme Court of Law into contempt, and even to destroy the Law itself: there may come a time when these persons themselves may want the protection of the law and of this Court, which they now endeavour to destroy, and which, if they succeed in their attempts. It may be too late for them to repair to for justice: but I trust, that the ancient virtue and spirit of this people will return and the law be established on a firm basis. If you, Gentlemen, have seen or read any of the libels which have been published, and have imbibed prejudices of any sort, I do now charge you, in that sacred Name which you have in the most solemn manner invoked for the faithful discharge of your present trust, to divest your minds of every thing that may tend to biass them in this cause: it is your duty to fix your eyes solely on the scales of justice and as the
<PB N="199" REF="011683_0101_0F87C7CE4D2D8900"/>
law and evidence in either scale may preponderate, so you are to determine by your verdict.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the prisoners at the bar are indicted, with others, for the murder of five different persons; viz. <HI>Car∣rol</HI> for the murder of <HI>James Caldwell; Kulroy</HI> for the mur∣der of <HI>Samuel Maverick; White</HI> for the murder of <HI>Patrick Carr; Hartegan</HI> for the murder of <HI>Samuel Gray; Warren</HI> for the murder of <HI>Crispus Attucks.</HI> Observe, that the five pri∣soners I have now named are severally charged as principals in the different supposed murders, and the others as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iding and abetting, which in the sense of the law makes the latter principals in the second degree.</P>
<P>I should have given to you the definitions of the different species of homicide, but as my brother hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oke so largely upon this subject, and hath produced so many and so indisputable authorities relative thereto, I would not exhaust your patience which hath so remarkably held out during this long trial. But I would add one au∣thority to the numbers which have been produced, not that it immediately relates to this case, but I the rather do it, be∣cause I see a mixt audience, and many from the country whom it more directly concerns: it it cited from the celebrated <HI>Ld. C. Just.

<P>I would recommend to you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> in order to your forming a just verdict in this cause, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fy yourselves in the <HI>first</HI> pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, whether or not the prisoners at the bar were an unla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ful assembly when they were at the <HI>Custom-house</HI> for on that much depends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir guilt or innocence. That they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh the <HI>Custom-house</HI> when the <HI>five</HI> persons mentioned in the indictments were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled, you c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n have no doubt, for it in conceded. Inquire then how they came there. Now, two officers viz. Capt <HI>Mason</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Capt. <HI>OHara</HI> have sworn that a Sentinel was placed at the <HI>Custom house,</HI> by orders of the com∣manding officer to protect the King's monies, and that it is at his peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t he stirs from his duty: it appears by divers witnesses that this S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntinel was attacked and call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d for aid; upon which a party, consisting of the prisoners at the bar with an officer at their head, went down to protect him: they were under obligation by act of parliament to obey their commanding officer; and thus far, being at their post constituted them a lawful assembly.</P>
<P>Consider next, whether those who were collected around the prisoners at the bar, were a lawful or unlawful ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m∣bly; and in order to satisfy yourselves, weigh the evidence that hath been offered impartially. But I cannot help tak∣ing notice in this place, that some delicacy hath been used at the bar, in calling t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e people a <HI>mob.

<P>As my b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>other <HI>Trowbridge</HI> has been very full in his remarks upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vidence, and as you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Foreman</HI> have wrote down from h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s months what they testified which is somewhat uncommon, and for which you are to be ap∣plauded, I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>herefore only m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke a few remarks on those I think the most material testimonies, not beginning in the order of <HI>examination,</HI> but in the order of <HI>time.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas Simmons</HI> say<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wix<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>eight</HI> and <HI>nine</HI> o'clock on that unhappy evening, (which was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore the firing, for the firing was not till between <HI>nine</HI> and <HI>ten</HI>) he heard peo∣ple at the Sugar house barracks, which are called <HI>Murray's
<PB N="202" REF="011683_0102_0F87C7CEDFEE6870"/>
barracks,</HI> say, <HI>if the soldiers would not come out and fight them, they would set fire to the four corners of the barracks, and burn every damned soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n them</HI>; that there was a considerable num∣ber of them armed with outlasses, swords, and sticks.</P>
<P><HI>William Davis</HI> is the next witness I shall take notice of; he is a gentleman who is a stranger to me, but whose cha∣racter stands unimpeached in this Court, and who hath gi∣ven a distinct testimony of what passed under his notice: he says, that about <HI>eight</HI> o'clock he saw about <HI>two hun∣dred in</HI> Forestreet, <HI>armed with different weapons, threatening to knock down the first soldier or bloody back they should meet; some proposed to go to the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uthward and join their friends there, and drive all the soldiers out of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn. At</HI> Dock-square, <HI>about nine o'clock he says he saw numbers in the market <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earing up the stalls and saying damn the dogs, where are they now? let us go and kill that damned scoundrel of a Sentry, and then attack the</HI> Main-guard; <HI>others said,</HI> Smith's <HI>barracks.</HI> At <HI>Olivers deck</HI> he says, <HI>he saw numbers with clubs: one man was loading his piece, and said he would do for some of them scoundrels that night, and said, damn the villains, scoundrells, Soldiers and Commissioners, and damn the villain who first sent them here, they should not remain here a∣bove two days longer.</HI></P>
<P>Allow me, Gentlemen, to make a pause at this last part of the evidence, viz <HI>Damn the villain who first sent them here</HI>; and make an observation which I am so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry for the occ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion of the expression having been justified. I venture to affirm that man a villain who uttered it, for it was <HI>his Majesty</HI> who <HI>sent them here, and here they were fixed by his order and authority.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rons,</HI> who lives near to <HI>Murray's barrack's</HI> hath told you, that a little after <HI>eight</HI> o'clock he saw people coming from <HI>Dock square</HI> and heard the word. <HI>Town born turn out,</HI> twenty or thirty times, and the people encreasing. He mentions the altereations between the officers and inhabi∣tants, and a little man talking with an officer, saying, <HI>You know the town and country have been used <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll we did not send for you, we won't have you here, we'll get rid of you, or drive you a∣way; and that then about two thirds of them went off and said, let's go to the</HI> Main-guard, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uzza for the</HI> Main-guard.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. Jeffries</HI> says, that about eight o'clock he saw the pas∣sage to <HI>Murray's barracks</HI> filled with inhabitants, who, with ill language dared the soldiers to fight: he imagines there were <HI>seventy</HI> or <HI>eighty</HI> people, and but <HI>three</HI> soldiers, and that when the officers were endeavouring to appease the
<PB N="203" REF="011683_0102_0F87C7CEDFEE6870"/>
people, snow-balls were flung at them; and that when they told the people that the soldiers were secured in their bar∣racks and could not come out, somebody replied. <HI>You mean they dare not come out you dare not let them.</HI> Some then said <HI>home,</HI> others said, <HI>no we shall find some in King-street,</HI> others said, <HI>we'll go to the Main guard.</HI> Dr. <HI>Jeffries</HI> hath been so di∣stinct and particular, that you cannot but remember his testimony.</P>
<P>As to the pains which have been taken to exculpate this town from being concerned in the fatal action of that night, they seen to me to have been unnecessary. It is true, there hath been, in times past, no place more remarkable for order and good government than this town; but as it is a seaport town and of great trade, it is not to be wonder∣ed at, that the inhabitants of it should be infected with dis∣order as well as other populous places.</P>
<P><HI>James Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>krig,</HI> with three others, say, that before the bells rang they saw, not far from <HI>Murray's barracks,</HI> a <HI>large number armed with different weapons</HI>; some of them say, nigh <HI>two hundred: that some of the people had been repulsed from the barracks, and after that, a tall man with a red cloak and white wig talked to the people, who listned to him, and then buzzaed for the Main-guard.</HI> I cannot but make this observation on the <HI>tall man with a red cloàk and white wig,</HI> that, whoever he was, if the buzz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng for the <HI>Main-guard</HI> and then attacking the soldiers, was the consequence of his speech to the people, that <HI>tall man</HI> is guilty in the fight of GOD, of the murder of the <HI>five</HI> persons mentioned in the indictment, and altho' he may never be brought to a court of justice here, yet, unless he speedily flies to the city of refuge, the supreme avenger of innocent blood, will surely overtake him.</P>
<P><HI>John Gridley</HI> hath told you, that he heard numbers before the <HI>Town-house</HI> say, GOD <HI>damn the rascals,</HI> some said, <HI>this will never do, the readiest way to get rid of those people, is to at∣tack the Main-guard, strike at the root, this is the nest</HI>; others replied, <HI>damn you, that's right.</HI> All this was before the sol∣diers had formed.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious to recite the numbers of testimo∣nies to prove a design to attack the soldiers: I have selected a few, which seem to prove the intent, for there are no less than <HI>thirty eight</HI> witnesses to this fact, <HI>six</HI> of whom the council for the King have produced. Compare them Gen∣tlemen, and then determine whether or not there is any
<PB N="204" REF="011683_0103_0F87C7CF627BE568"/>
room to doubt of the numbers collected around the soldiers at the <HI>Custom house,</HI> being a riotous assembly.</P>
<P>I will return now to the soldiers and view their behaviour whilst they were going upon duty at the <HI>Custom house,</HI> and whilst they were there. As they were going from the <HI>Main-guard</HI> to their post, to support the Sentry, (who by the way behaved with a good temper of mind, in endea∣vouring to avoid a dispute by attempting to get into the <HI>Custom house,</HI> which he was by no means obliged to do,) I say, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s they were going down, <HI>Nathaniel Fosdick</HI> says, <HI>they bid him make way</HI> but he refused: instead of forcing him to give way, he says, <HI>they gave way to him,</HI> and passed to their post; when they got there, they loaded; and <HI>John Gridley</HI> says, that, <HI>whilst they were loading, he passed between the fires and they put up their guns to let him pass.</HI> I cannot find, up∣on examining the testimonies, that any one soldier st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red from his post, and indeed it might have been fatal to him to have broke his orders; but on the contrary, it hath been said, that had they stepped forward, they might have kil∣led the people, but that they only pushed their bayonets as they stood, to keep off the people who were pressing on them; at the same time, bidding them keep off.</P>
<P>Now consider whether the prisoners had any just provo∣cation to fire upon ihe inhabitants, for that some of them did fire, you can be in no doubt There are <HI>twenty five</HI> wit∣nesses who have sworn to <HI>ice, snow-balls, sticks,</HI> &amp;c. being thrown at the prisoners, <HI>ten</HI> of whom, are winesses for the Crown. There are nigh <HI>thirty</HI> witnesses who have sworn to words of provocation uttered against the prisoners, as dar∣ing them to fire, and threatning to kill them; but you must remember that words only, are no provocation in law to justify the killing of a person; but if threatning expressi∣ons are attended with an attempt on the life of a man, in such a case a killing may be justified; and if any such facts appear in this trial, you must consider them thorough∣ly. And here, I would take notice of the testimonies of some of the witnesses, <HI>viz.</HI> that although they were close to the soldiers, they saw nothing of any kind thrown at them, nor heard any <HI>huzza</HI> or a <HI>threatning</HI>: nay, one witness is so distinct, as to tell, in a cloud of smoak, which guns killed the different persons. I know not how to account for such testimonies, unless by the witnesses being affrighted, which
<PB N="205" REF="011683_0103_0F87C7CF627BE568"/>
some of them say they were not: they themselves perhaps may s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y their own minds.</P>
<P>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Jefferies</HI> relates an account which he had from <HI>Patrick Carr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> one of the deceased, who on his death bed repeated∣ly told him and confirmed it but a few hours before he di∣ed, that <HI>he went with a design against the soldiers, that the sol∣dier were pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted as they were going to their post, that he thought they were abused and that they would really have fired before, for he heard many voices cry out, kill them, and that he thought they fixed to defend themselves: that he forgave, and did not blame the man, whoever he was, that shot him; that he blamed himself for going to the riot, and might have known better, for he had seen soldier: called to quel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> riots, but never saw any bear half so much before.</HI> This <HI>Carr</HI> was not upon oath, it is true, but you will determine, whether a man, just stepping into eternity, is not to be believed, especially in favour of a set of men by by whom he had lost his life.</P>
<P>Ye have one difficulty to solve, Gentlemen, and that is, that there were <HI>five</HI> persons killed, and here are <HI>eight</HI> soldiers charged with murdering them. Now one witness says, that the <HI>Corporal</HI> did not fire, and <HI>Thowas Wilkinson</HI> says, that the guns of the <HI>third</HI> or fourth man from the eighth flashed, so that there are <HI>two</HI> guns of <HI>eight</HI> not discharged and yet it is said <HI>seven</HI> were fired This evinces the uncertainty of some of the testimonies. My brother <HI>Trowbridge</HI> hath explained the difficulty of charging any one prisoner with killing any one particular person, and hath adduced an authority from Lord Chief Justice <HI>Hale,</HI> to support him; so that this max∣im of law cannot be more justly applied, than in this case, <HI>viz</HI> That it is better that <HI>ten</HI> guilty persons escape, than <HI>one</HI> innocent person suffer: indeed as to <HI>two</HI> of the priso∣ners, there is no great doubt of their firing, namely, <HI>Mont∣gomery</HI> and <HI>Killroy.</HI> As to <HI>Montgomery,</HI> it seems to be agreed that he was on the right, and <HI>Richard Palmes</HI> says, that <HI>a piece of ice or a stick struck his gun before he fired</HI>: and <HI>Andrew,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wendell</HI>'s Negro man (of whom his master gives a parti∣cular and good character) is very distinct in his account; and he says, that <HI>a stout man struck the grenadier on the right, first on his gun and then on his head, and also kept his bayonet in his left hand; and then a cry of kill the dogs, knock them over</HI>; up∣on which he soon fired: here take the words and the blows together, and then say, whether this <HI>firing</HI> was not justifi∣able.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="011683_0104_0F87C7D0204DD238"/>As to <HI>Killroy,</HI> there have been stronger attempts to prove him guilty of murder than any oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. <HI>Two</HI> witnesses have sworn, that his bayonet was bloody next morning; but no∣thing hath been offered in evidence to prove how it came so; I have only one way to account for it; if it was bloo∣dy, <HI>viz.</HI> that by pushing to keep off <HI>Nathaniel Fosdick</HI> it might become so by wounding him in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. <HI>Nicholas Ferreter,</HI> who the week before b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at one of the sol∣diers at the Rope walks, says further, that <HI>Killroy</HI> was then at the Rope walks; but at the same time he says, that <HI>Kill∣roy</HI> uttered no threatnings ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the Rope-makers to com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out. But <HI>Samuel Hemmingway</HI> says, that some time before the 5th <HI>March</HI> as heard <HI>Killroy</HI> say, that he would not miss an opportunity of fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng on the inhabitants. How the conversation was had, whether it was maliciously spoke or was jocose talk doth not so fully appear, but it would be extream hard to connect such discourse with this transaction; especially, as his being at the <HI>Custom House</HI> was not volun∣tary, but by order of his officer.</P>
<P>Thus Gentlemen, I have as concisely as I could, without doing injustice to the cause, summed up the evidence to you: I was afraid of being tedious, otherwise I should have more minutely considered it.</P>
<P>If upon the whole, by comparing the evidence▪ ye should find that the prisoners were a lawful assembly at the <HI>Cus∣tom house,</HI> which ye can be in no doubt of if you believe the witnesses, and also that they behaved properly in their own department whilst there, and did not fire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill there was a necessity to do it in their own defence, which I think there is a violent presumption of: and if, on the other hand, ye should find that the people who were collected a∣round the soldiers, were an unlawful assembly, and had a design to endanger, if not to take away their lives, as seems to be evident, from blows succeeeding threatnings; ye must, in such case acquit the prisoners; or if upon the whole, ye are in any reasonable doubt of their guilt, ye must then, agreeable to the rule of law, declare them in∣nocent.</P>
<P>As I said at first, this cause is of the last importance to the prisoners, their lives or deaths depend upon your ver∣dict; and may you be conducted by the SUPREME WISDOM to return such an one, as that your hearts may not re∣proach you so long as you live, and as shall acquit you at

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>MANY Gentlemen having expressed a desire, that some account of the evidence as it appeared on the trial of <HI>Edward Manwarring, John Munro, Hammond Green,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Greenwood</HI> should be made public, we have, for the satisfaction of such, who wish to be made acquaint∣ed with the real state of facts respecting the above four persons, inserted by way of appendix from the minutes of a gentleman who attended the trial, the substance of what the witnesses produced, as well on the part of the Crown, as of the prisoners, testified on that trial.</P>
<P>The prisoners were charged by the Grand Jury, with be∣ing <HI>present,</HI> aiding, abetting and assisting, &amp;c. <HI>William War∣ren</HI> in the murder of <HI>Crispus Attucks</HI>; as is at large set forth in the indictment, at the beginning of the preceed∣ing trial.</P>
<P>This trial came on the 12th day of <HI>December</HI> last, and (<HI>Jonathan Sewall,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the King's Attorney, being absent) <HI>Samuel Quincy,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> conducted the cause on the part of the Crown.</P>
<P>After the Jury were impaneled, Mr. <HI>Quincy</HI> opened the facts on which he expected to support the charge against the prisoners; and then called the following witnesses.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="testimony">
<HEAD><HI>Samuel Drowne,</HI> son of Mr. <HI>Thomas Drowne</HI> of <HI>Boston,</HI> Tin∣plate Worker, sworn,</HEAD>
<P>I know all the prisoners: I was in <HI>King-street</HI> on the even∣ing of the 5th <HI>March,</HI> when the party of soldiers at the <HI>Custom-house</HI> fired on the people assembled in <HI>King street.</HI>— I then saw two flashes from the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> but who fired them cannot tell, one of the flashes came from the balcony of the <HI>Custom house,</HI> and the other from a chamber window of the <HI>Custom house,</HI> the second window from the corner of <HI>Royal exchange-lane,</HI> and the third from the balcony; I saw a person in the balcony, with something in his hand, a gun or pistol. I saw the flash, but I heard no report, when I saw this flash, it was at the time the soldiers were firing; I did not think it a time to stay and hear the report, but I saw him after the flash go from the balcony into the house, he went in stooping. When I saw the flash, I was standing in the middle of <HI>King-street</HI> between <HI>Quaker-lane</HI> and <HI>Roal-exchange-lane.</HI>
<PB N="212" REF="011683_0107_0F87C7D67222EE30"/>
I also saw a flash from the middle window of the <HI>Cus∣tom house</HI> chamber, between the balcony and <HI>Royal-exchange-lane,</HI> I cannot tell whether this flash came from a gun or a pistol, the muzzel was thrust out of the window above a yard, the fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh was inside. I don't know that either of the prisoners were in the balcony, or at the <HI>Custom-house</HI> that night. The flash I saw at the window, was inside, and as near the glass as the length of a man's hand. The dis∣tance between the two flashes was a quarter of a minute.— I did not see any flash from the muzzels of either of their guns or pistols, but the flash at the window blaz'd up half a yard, the window was open two or three inches, I saw no person at the widow.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Gillam Bass.</HI> Upholster, <HI>sworn.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I was in <HI>King street</HI> on the evening of the 5th <HI>March</HI> last, saw the soldiers fire,—two or three flashes seemed four or five feet higher than the rest. I saw no firing from the <HI>Custom house,</HI> nor any person in the balcony or at the win∣dows. I did not look there. I stood near Mr. <HI>Stone</HI>'s steps.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="testimony">
<HEAD><HI>Timothy White,</HI> Stationer, <HI>sworn.</HI></HEAD>
<P>He was called in support of <HI>Drowne</HI>'s character. He swore <HI>Samuel Drowne</HI> lived with him two years, and during that time attended his shop; that he never observed any thing to impeach his veracity or understanding.—Some people thought him foolish.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="testimony">
<HEAD><HI>Charles Bourgat,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> boy, born at <HI>Bourdeux,</HI> servant to Mr. <HI>Manwarring, sworn.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I am an apprentice to Mr. <HI>Edward Manwarring.</HI> On the evening of the 5th <HI>March</HI> last, I was at Mr. <HI>Hudson</HI>'s in <HI>Back-street,</HI> at the <HI>North end,</HI> where my master then lodg∣ed, Mr. <HI>Hudson</HI> and his wife were at home; when the bells rung I ran into <HI>King street,</HI> and to the door of the <HI>Custom∣house</HI> which was on a jarr partly open, and a young man one <HI>Green,</HI> he with one eye, (<HI>pointing to Hammond Green</HI>) o∣pened the door and pulled me in; two or three gentlemen came down stairs, and one of them a tall man, pulled me up stairs, and said to me, you must fire, the tall man gave me a gun, and said to me "<HI>if you don't fire I'll kill you.</HI>"— I went up stairs and stood at a front window in the cham∣ber, and the tall man loaded two guns with two balls each, and I fired them both; as soon as I had fired one gun, he, the tall man, said again to me, "<HI>if you don't fire I will kill
<PB N="213" REF="011683_0107_0F87C7D67222EE30"/>
you.</HI>" He had a cane with a sword in it in his hand, and compelled me to fire both the guns. After I had fired these two guns, Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI> fired one gun also out of the same window. The tall man loaded the three guns, and I see him put the balls into each of them and heard them go gown. The two guns I fired, I pointed up the street and in the air. When my master Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI> pointed his gun out of the window I was in the room, but went out and was on the stairs before his gun went off, I heard it, but did not see it. As soon as I had fired, the tall man took me down stairs, and said he would give me money if I would not tell: I replied, I did not want any money, but if I was called before the Justices, I would tell the truth. There were a great many people in the house, and a num∣ber of people round me in the chamber where I fired, I can't tell the precise number, but there were more than ten, Mr. <HI>Munro</HI> and <HI>Hammond Green</HI> were in the house below stairs, Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI> was in the chamber when all the three guns were lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded and fired, there was the space of a mi∣nute and an half between the second gun I fired, and the third which my Master fired. There was a candle in the chamber, but I cannot tell whether there were one or two windows in it. When I came up into the chamber, there were two guns in it, I fired twice out of the same gun, but I cannot tell whether Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI> fired the same gun I did. At the time I and my master fired, the street below was full of people, and the mob were throwing sticks, snow-balls, &amp;c. It was pretty dark, but I don't know but there might be a little moon. I can't tell whether the guns my master and I fired, were fired before or after the firing by the soldiers. When I went from Mr. <HI>Hudson</HI>'s to the <HI>Custom house,</HI> I passed through the lane that leads from the <HI>Market</HI> to the <HI>Custom house,</HI> (<HI>Royal-exchange-lane</HI>) and I did not see the Sentry box or any soldiers near the <HI>Custom house</HI>; there were many people round there in the street. Immedi∣ately after I went down stairs, I went out of the house and saw a great number of people throwing snow-balls and sticks, but I saw no soldiers. I returned to Mr. <HI>Hudson</HI>'s house, Mr <HI>Hudson</HI> and his wife were then at home, and no other person in the house. Upon being again asked where he was when he heard the report of his master's gun? Says, he was quite down stairs. Upon being asked whether he was not soon after his commitment taken out of goal and
<PB N="214" REF="011683_0108_0F87C7D7035D5018"/>
examined by Mr. <HI>Molineux</HI>? Says, he was in the goal∣er's house with Mrs. <HI>Otis</HI> the prison keeper's wife, Mr. <HI>Wal∣lis,</HI> deputy sheriff, and Mr. <HI>Molineux,</HI> and that the latter told him to tell the truth: and that this was previous to his examination before the Justices.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Quincy</HI> declaring he had no further evidence to pro∣duce on the part of the Crown. The prisoners desired the following witnesses might be sworn and examined, which was done accordingly.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Edward Paine, George Bethane,</HI> and <HI>Edward Davis,</HI> Mer∣chants, and <HI>Harrison Gray</HI> junr. they testified, That they stood opposite the <HI>Custom-house</HI> on the evening of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> last, when the firing was in <HI>King street</HI> that their faces were towards the <HI>Custom-house.</HI> That the moon shone strong on the house, that they did not see the balcony door of the <HI>Custom house</HI> open that evening, or any person in the balcony, or any window in the front of the house open, or guns fired from either the balcony or any of the windows in the front of the house, and are fully satisfied no such thing could have happened while the soldiers were there with∣out their observing it. That they stood opposite the <HI>Custom-house</HI> in full view of it from he time the soldiers first came down there until all the guns were discharged. That they are satisfied the whole of the firing was from the street, and that all above was quiet, and no light in any of the front rooms of the <HI>Custom house.</HI> Mr. <HI>Davis</HI> added, that soon after the firing he saw two women standing at the chamber win∣dow of the <HI>Custom-house,</HI> which is next to <HI>Royal-exchange-lane,</HI> with their hands under their aprons, in the posture of spectators.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="testimony">
<HEAD>Elizabeth Avery, sworn.</HEAD>
<P>I lived with Mr. <HI>Bartholemew Green</HI> at the <HI>Custom-house</HI> on the 5th of <HI>March</HI> last, and when the noise was in the street, before the house I went with (Hammond Green <HI>the prisoner at the bar</HI>) <HI>Nancey Green</HI> and <HI>Mary Rogers</HI> up into that cham∣ber of the house, which is next to <HI>Royal exchange-lane</HI> and right over the Sentry box as it then stood, and from the west window in that room saw the party of soldiers come down from the <HI>Main-guard</HI> to the Sentry; I tarried in this room till the firing was all over, and the soldiers had re∣turned from whence they came. There was no other per∣son in this room, (except them I have mentioned) during the
<PB N="215" REF="011683_0108_0F87C7D7035D5018"/>
whole time of my being there, but <HI>Thomas Greenwood</HI> who came in and went out again in a minute. Nor was there any gun or pistol, or candle in the room. Nor was the door of the balcony or any of the windows of the chamber opened that evening to my knowledge, and I verily believe they were not. The <HI>French</HI> Boy, who has just been sworn in this Court was not there that evening, nor did I ever see him there in my life. Nor was Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI> or Mr. <HI>Munroe</HI> there on that evening.</P>
<P><HI>Ann Green</HI> daughter of Mr. <HI>Bartholemew Green,</HI> was then sworn, and confirmed in every particular the testimony of <HI>Elizabeth Avery,</HI> the preccedihg witness.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="testimony">
<HEAD><HI>Elizabeth Hudson,</HI> the wife of Mr. <HI>John Hudson,</HI> with whom Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI> boarded on the evening of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, was <HI>sworn.</HI></HEAD>
<P>She deposed that on the evening of the 5th of <HI>March,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edward Manwarring</HI> was at her house, in <HI>Back street</HI> at the northerly part of the town, together with Mr. <HI>John Munroe</HI> and one Mr. <HI>Warwell,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> Boy, <HI>Charles Bourgat</HI> was also there. That when the bells rung, she, Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI> and the two Gentlemen who were with him, went to a window fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting the street to inquire where the fire was, supposing that occasioned the ringing of the bells. That hearing from the conversation in the street there was no fire but some disturbance, they all left the window, and Messrs. <HI>Manwarring, Munroe</HI> and <HI>Warwell,</HI> went into Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI>'s chamber. That her the depo∣ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t's husband was out of town that evening, and she being afraid to be alone went into Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI>'s room, and tarried there until all the bells were done ringing and the disturbance was all over. That Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI> called his servant boy <HI>Charles Bourgat</HI> up into the room where the de∣ponent and the others were, and kept him there the whole evening, until after the bells had all ceased ringing, and until after ten o'clock, That she is certain the <HI>French</HI> boy, <HI>Charles Bourgat,</HI> was not out of her sight five minutes at a time, from the time the bells began to ring until after ten o'clock. Nor does she know that he went out of the house during that night. That M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sses, <HI>Manwarring, Munroe</HI> and <HI>Warwell,</HI> were at her house from the dusk of evening until about half after ten o'clock, and did not go out of the house during that whole time. That Mr. <HI>Munroe</HI> about
<PB N="216" REF="011683_0109_0F87C7D7A1287EB0"/>
half after ten o'clock said he would go home to his lodg∣ings, which Mr. <HI>Manwarring</HI> endeavoured to dissuade him from, telling him he might be molested, as he went thro' the street: He <HI>Munroe</HI> however went away, but Mr. <HI>Manwar∣ring</HI> and Mr. <HI>Warwell</HI> tarried in the house all night.</P>
<P>The Court then inquired of the boy, whether he heard and understood what Mrs. <HI>Hudson</HI> had testified, he said yes, and that her account was false, and that what he himself had now declared in Court, was the truth and nothing but the truth.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John Lovell,</HI> Mr. <HI>Edward Marriot,</HI> Mr. <HI>Ellwin</HI> of <HI>Que∣bec,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Philip Dumaresque</HI> were then sworn as inter∣preters; and the boy was re-examined in <HI>French</HI> and again affirmed in <HI>French</HI> to said interpreters, all the material parts of his testimony as he had given it in <HI>English</HI> before.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="testimony">
<HEAD><HI>James Penny,</HI> was then called and <HI>sworn.</HI></HEAD>
<P>He deposed that he was in goal in <HI>Boston</HI> for debt, that while there <HI>Charles Bourgat</HI> the <HI>French</HI> boy, voluntarily, and without any threats or persuasion declared to him, and one <HI>Elisha Ingraham</HI> then also a prisoner for debt in said goal— "That what he testified to the Grand Jury and before the Justices on his examination with regard to his master <HI>Ed∣ward Manwarring,</HI> and <HI>John Munroe,</HI> their firing out of the <HI>Custom-house</HI> on the evening of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> last, was in every paticular false, and that he did swear in that man∣ner by the persuasion of <HI>William Molineux,</HI> who told him he would take him from his master and provide for him, and that Mr. <HI>Molineux</HI> frightned him by telling him if he refus∣ed to swear against his master and Mr. <HI>Munro</HI> the mob in <HI>Boston</HI> would kill him: and farther that Mrs. <HI>Waldron,</HI> the wife of Mr. <HI>Waldron</HI> a taylor in <HI>Back street,</HI> who sells gin∣ger bread and drams, gave him the said <HI>Charles</HI> gin∣ger bread and cheese, and desired him to swear against his master." The said <HI>Charles</HI> farther declared, "that neither he nor his master <HI>Edward Manwarring</HI> were at the <HI>Custom∣house</HI> at any time on the evening of the 5th of <HI>March</HI> last."</P>
<P><HI>Charles Bourgat</HI> the <HI>French</HI> boy positively denied he ever made any such declaration to Mr. <HI>James Penny</HI> or any other person; and desired that one <HI>Wm.

<HI>Penny,</HI> in procuring this declaration.—<HI>Page</HI> was accord∣ingly sworn. He deposed that some time after <HI>Manwarring</HI> and <HI>Munroe</HI> were indicted, he saw <HI>James Penny</HI> the former witness at the window of the room where <HI>Charles Bourgat</HI> was confined, on the back-side of the goal, that <HI>Penny</HI> had a pen in his hand, a paper laying before him, and was talk∣ing earnestly and roughly to the boy. That he this deponent heard Mr. <HI>Penny</HI> speak quick to the boy, and asked him "<HI>Is this true,</HI>" but that he could not hear what the boy said, though he listened.—On being asked, whether he e∣ver saw the boy carried out of the goal to Mr. <HI>Otis</HI> the pri∣son-keeper's house by Mr. <HI>Molineux</HI> to be examined, said that after <HI>Penny</HI> had told of this confession of the boys, Mr. <HI>Molineux</HI> did come to the goal and the boy was taken out and carried into Mr. <HI>Otis</HI>'s house, and there declared he never made the confession or declaration <HI>Penny</HI> pretended, and also that Mr. <HI>Molineux</HI> never urged or required him to say any thing but the truth.</P>
<P><HI>The Jury acquitted all the Prisoners, without going from their Stats.</HI></P>
