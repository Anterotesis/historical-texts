<L>Forgets his miseries:</L>
<L>Hark! lonely widows sing to thee,</L>
<L>And shouts from orphans rise.</L>

<L>For one man's sin, his whole race doom,</L>
<L>And all who draw the human breath,</L>

<L>Where Sin is spoil'd; so Grace doth reign</L>
<L>In all the worth of divine blood.</L>

<L>An host of daily sins pursues</L>
<L>Man to a second death; but Grace</L>

<L>6 By which it might with freedom flow,</L>

<L>Where it should have an endless rest:</L>
<L>God's wisdom here prevents our quest.</L>

<L>7 What is capacious to receive</L>
<L>Unbounded love, if bounds it have?</L>
<L>Or where is found an object meet</L>
<L>For grace and mercy infinite?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>8 Not all the things which could be made,</L>
<L>A proper match among them had</L>
<L>For boundless love, which goes not forth</L>
<L>To objects limited in worth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>9 Neither can all created things</L>
<L>Pass for its fruit <HI>(the gift it brings)</HI></L>
<L>When the intention is to shew,</L>
<L>By <HI>giving,</HI> all that grace can do:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>10 Nor yet could sin-forgiving grace,</L>
<L>'Mong all the creatures find a place,</L>

<L>11 But Love, which is the only God,</L>

<L>All bless'd in Love's society.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>12 One of these Three, with all his worth,</L>
<L>To union near with men goes forth;</L>
<L>So join'd to them, that, in his name,</L>
<L>A right to all this love they claim.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>13 But, first, they're doom'd for sin to wo,</L>
<L>That he for them might undergo</L>
<L>Their curse, and so might fully prove</L>
<L>Th' infinite <HI>jealousy</HI> of Love:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>14 And at the same time manifest</L>
<L>Mercy relieving the distrest;</L>
<L>Mercy, all sov'reign, and all free,</L>
<L>Saving from boundless misery.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>15 He's unto them the fruit of love,</L>
<L>The <HI>gift</HI> which can its greatness prove;</L>
<L>And ev'ry gift which grace bestows</L>
<L>Is GOD-like as from him it flows.</L>
</LG>

<L>16 And he's the <HI>object;</HI> it goes forth</L>
<L>On them made perfect in his worth;</L>
<L>All built in him, one mansion meet,</L>
<L>Where God's love ever dwells complete.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>17 Let <HI>Wisdom,</HI> therefore, be his name;</L>
<L>The spring of wisdom him proclaim:</L>
<L>Call him the <HI>Word,</HI> who can express</L>
<L>God's goodness all, and fully bless.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>18 Call him the Father's only Son,</L>
<L>Son of his love; in him alone</L>

<L>That still thy page displays the plan,</L>
<L>And grand designs of God.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>6 Then tell us, sacred word, when shall</L>
<L>The Lord's redeem'd arise?</L>
<L>When shall they hear his powerful call,</L>
<L>To meet him in the skies?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>7 When the arch-angel's trump shall blow,</L>
<L>His dead the sound shall hear:</L>
<L>And rising from the tombs below,</L>
<L>Shall meet him in the air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>8 But deign, O sacred Word, to say</L>
<L>If he Man's sorrows feels;</L>
<L>O what concern protracts his stay?</L>
<L>Why stop his chariot-wheels?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>9 'Tis a concern of boundless grace</L>
<L>And great good-will to man;</L>
<L>Long suffering patience stops his pace,</L>
<L>'Till he completes his plan.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>10 'Till all the many sons, with whom</L>
<L>The son of God took part,</L>
<L>Shall in the sight of faith, like him,</L>
<L>Learn lowliness of heart.</L>

<L>11 Conform'd to him by his employ,</L>
<L>In shame, reproach, and thrall:</L>
<L>Like him, before the cup of joy,</L>
<L>First taste the cup of gall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>12 O then! quick as the light'ning darts,</L>
<L>Shall Jesus soon appear,</L>
<L>And heal his people's aching hearts,</L>
<L>And wipe away each tear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>13 The man whose mem'ry we revere,</L>
<L>Drank deep in sorrow's cup,</L>
<L>And learn'd by disappointments here,</L>
<L>Far better things to hope;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>14 Like the first foll'wers of the Lord,</L>
<L>Whose lives and doctrines he</L>
<L>Admir'd and copy'd; and their word</L>
<L>To speak was bold and free.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>15 This bus'ness made him many foes,</L>
<L>Few friends and scanty bread,</L>
<L>And scarcely found he at life's close</L>
<L>A place to lay his head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>16 Yet he complain'd not, nor repin'd,</L>
<L>But ever kept in view</L>
<L>That matchless humbleness of mind</L>
<L>Which God's dear Son did shew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>17 Patience and hope on ev'ry side,</L>
<L>(His comfort and his stay)</L>
<L>Did surely join, his steps to guide,</L>
<L>Else he had lost the way.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="127" REF="020391_0125_0FAF060459F83568"/>
<L>18 But patience with the cordial word</L>
<L>Refresh'd his memory,</L>
<L>He talk'd of joys with which the Lord</L>
<L>Rewarded his on high.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>19 When hope and patience deign to guide</L>
<L>Man in the narrow way;</L>
<L>With ease they'll in the path abide;</L>
<L>Far from it never stray.</L>

<L>OUR Elder and our faithful friend,</L>
<L>Who was by us so much belov'd,</L>
<L>Death now, from all the ills of life,</L>
<L>To endless glory hath remov'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>2 To speak his praise is not our theme:</L>
<L>All praise and glory ever be</L>
<L>To him who taught his heart to know</L>
<L>God's boundless grace and mercy free.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>3 Led by th' unerring hand of him,</L>
<L>Who giveth grace to whom he will;</L>
<L>He rose from Babel, to bring forth</L>
<L>Christ's captives, and his word fulfill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>4 Trembling at that enduring word,</L>
<L>The ancient Christian order he</L>
<L>Reviv'd; and now, Christ's little flocks</L>
<L>In order, as at first we see.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>5 Before these flocks he chearful went</L>
<L>In faith and servent charity:</L>
<L>In patient suff'ring, joyful hope.</L>
<L>And self-denied humility.</L>

<L>6 No lordship o'er the flocks he claim'd;</L>
<L>Their God he led them to revere;</L>
<L>To all God's words regard to shew,</L>
<L>And of none else to stand in fear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>7 The love of Christ inflam'd his breast</L>
<L>With love and tender care alway.</L>
<L>To all who seem'd to love that truth,</L>
<L>In which his joy and comfort lay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>8 Ost did his bosom swell with grief,</L>
<L>When he their wants and troubles knew;</L>
<L>And, like a tender-hearted friend,</L>
<L>His love in deed and truth did shew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>9 The ease and pleasures of this life</L>
<L>And all its boasted honours vain,</L>
<L>With chearfulness he did forsake,</L>
<L>The truth of Jesus to maintain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>10 Bold as a lion he appear'd,</L>
<L>When for that truth he did contend;</L>
<L>For this no face of man he fear'd;</L>
<L>But would oppose his dearest friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>11 Much, much contempt and false reproach,</L>
<L>He did for it with joy endure;</L>
<L>As knowing whom he had believ'd,</L>
<L>And that his word stands ever sure.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>12 The blessed, heavenly, glorious hope</L>
<L>Of endless life, thro' Jesus' cross,</L>
<L>Was the great prize he had in view,</L>
<L>For <HI>this</HI> he counted all things loss.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>13 Ev'n in old age, when others fail,</L>
<L>He still in rich fruits did increase,</L>
<L><PB N="129" REF="020391_0127_0FAF0605D1AB8388"/>Until his course was fully run,</L>
<L>And then—his latter end was peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>14 The world was crucify'd to him,</L>
<L>And he to it was crucify'd;</L>
<L>By faith of Jesus Christ he liv'd,</L>
<L>And in the faith of him he dy'd.</L>
</LG>

<L>15 Let us, dear brethren, follow him,</L>
<L>As he the Lord did follow still;</L>

<P>MOST of the Songs in this Book are in what is called Common or Long Metres; the Lines of the former contain Eight and Six Sylla∣bles alternately; and those of the latter all Eight, and Four Lines to each Verse. No Singer needs be at any loss for Tunes to these, as there are many Psalm and Song Tunes for such Metres. It may be observed however, that some of the Scots and English Song Tunes answer a few of them well, such as the following,</P>
