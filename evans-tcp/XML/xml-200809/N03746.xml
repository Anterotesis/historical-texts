<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE good Reception the poetical manuscript Writings of my deceased Father <HI>Aquila Rose,</HI> have met with in this Province, from Men of Wit and Taste, with a Desire of some of those to see them printed, induced me to collect what I could: But, many of his best Pieces were lent out, after his Decease, by my Mother, to Persons who have forgot to return them: And, perhaps the publishing these few, will put them in Mind of sending them to me.</P>
<P>I should be wanting in Gratitude, if I did not return my humble Thanks to those careful People who have favour'd me with the Pieces I now publish to the World; and to the Gentlemen, my Father's Friends, for their nice Encomiums to his Memory.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE MEMORY OF AQUILA ROSE, <HI>Deceas'd.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>OFT', O ye Muses! to delightful Scenes,</L>
<L>Are you invok'd or courted on the Greens;</L>
<L>In soothing Verse, to lull the Lover's Pains,</L>
<L>Or sprightly Songs, to glad the blithy Swains:</L>
<L>O now assist! when Sighs and Tears implore,</L>
<L>To sing a Bard, whose Voice we hear no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Albion</HI> his Birth, his Learning <HI>Albion</HI> gave;</L>
<L>To Manhood grown, he cross'd the stormy Wave,</L>
<L>More Arts, and Nature's wondrous Ways to find,</L>
<L>Illuminate, and fortify his Mind;</L>
<L>And to divert his Eyes from Cross Affairs:</L>
<L>For Love dissastrous fill'd his Breast with Cares.</L>
<L>In <HI>Britain,</HI> he would say, he once was bless'd,</L>
<L>And all the Joys of Love and Life possess'd:</L>
<L>But some strange Power who envy'd his Repose,</L>
<L>Chang'd his Enjoyments to combining Woes;</L>
<L>Forc'd him to quit his former peaceful Way,</L>
<L>And prove his Fortune o'er a foamy Sea.</L>
<L>"Dear native Land, he sadly said, farewel,</L>
<L>"And those soft Shades where Love and <HI>Silvia</HI> dwell:</L>
<L>"Blow swift ye Gales, and waft me from the Shore,</L>
<L>"I fly from Love, and <HI>Silvia</HI> see no more.</L>

<L>Long then the Wand'rer sail'd from Land to Land.</L>
<L>To servile Business of rough Seas constrain'd:</L>
<L>Yet not the less, where e'er their Vessel steer'd</L>
<L>Strangers admir'd him, as his Mates rever'd.</L>
<L>So 'tis, where Heaven exalted Sense bestows,</L>
<L>The limpid Mind thro' foul Obstructions glows:</L>
<L>Yet partial Fortune, or mysterious Fate</L>
<L>Debases wise Men, and to Fools gives State.</L>
<L>ROSE well some Post of Eminence could grace,</L>
<L>Who clad in Tar supplies a Sailor's Place.</L>
<L>Such was his Language, such his social Air,</L>
<L>As would th' unequal Destiny declare:</L>
<L>And while his Limbs to vulgar Service bend,</L>
<L>His brighter Thoughts to lofty Themes ascend.</L>
<L>Distinguish'd o're the common Crew he shone,</L>
<L>Unjustly ranked, or 'midst them all alone.</L>
<L>Bless'd in much Wit, and little Pride he strives</L>
<L>With adverse Fortune, as he further drives.</L>
<L>The <HI>Iberian</HI> Coast he saw, and swarthy <HI>Moors,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Etrurian</HI> Ports, and sweet <HI>Sardinian</HI> Shores;</L>
<L><HI>Sardinia,</HI> where the Powers of Love reside,</L>
<L>Where sable Veils ten Thousand beauties hide.</L>
<L>Yet not his Heart that charming Place confines,</L>
<L>A wider Search his active Soul designs:</L>
<L>He travels 'till our Western Tract he trode,</L>
<L>Which as he found a Home, here made his last Abode.</L>
<L>When thro' Fatigues by Land and Sea sustain'd,</L>
<L>His resting Point, our little Town he'd gain'd.</L>
<L>A few long Weeks by Sickness held, he lay,</L>
<L>Dark Hours to count, and slowly waste the Day:</L>
<L>Then gloomy Doubts, and pensive Thoughts arise,</L>
<L>And lonely thus, within himself he cries,</L>
<L>"Depriv'd of Health, and every bosom Friend,</L>
<L>"When shall my Toils, my lengthening Sorrows end;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="004593_0005_100DA7B0AF1BD468"/>
"My own low Genius here forsakes me too,</L>
<L>"And nothing for myself, myself can do:</L>
<L>"But can the Muse by grievous Tempests tost,</L>
<L>"Resume her Notes, and joyful Numbers boast!</L>
<L>"O how shall she her soft Ideas bring,</L>
<L>"And in strange Lands the Songs of Gladness sing!</L>
<L>"When Sorrows draw black Curtains o're the Soul,</L>
<L>"No gay Desires in our sad Bosoms roll:</L>
<L>"But the Remembrance of the Joys I lost</L>
<L>"On <HI>Britain</HI>'s happy Shore, afflicts me most.</L>
<L>"O had I now those pleasing Volumes here,</L>
<L>"Which in <HI>Britannia</HI> my Companions were;</L>
<L>"They might indeed some tedious Thoughts divert,</L>
<L>"Give some Refreshment to my drooping Heart:</L>
<L>"But destitute of Books, of Health, and Friends,</L>
<L>"As here my Wand'ring, here my Comfort ends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus wail'd he, yet while thus his Griefs complain'd,</L>
<L>His manly Soul to sink beneath disdain'd:</L>
<L>He rous'd anew his Reason to his Aid,</L>
<L>And charg'd his Spirits, not to fly dismay'd.</L>
<L>Now Hopes revive, and Health repairs her Seat,</L>
<L>Round flows the Blood, and equal Pulses beat:</L>
<L>His Name soon known, it led the Curious, where</L>
<L>They might his pleasing Conversation share.</L>
<L>Thus he, who late no friendly Pleasures knew,</L>
<L>Had daily now kind Visitants in View:</L>
<L>Each comes of Choice, and all his Friendship claim,</L>
<L>They courted him, and he delighted them:</L>
<L>Soft in Discourse, and easy of access,</L>
<L>Thankful his Mind, persuasive his address;</L>
<L>The learn'd approv'd his Wit, the unlearn'd admir'd,</L>
<L>And docile Youths to his Regard aspir'd.</L>
<L>O'erjoy'd to find himself so much caress'd,</L>
<L>His grateful Thoughts, he thus to them express'd,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="004593_0006_100DA7B25260F4C0"/>
"Tho' Agues late did chill, and Fevers burn,</L>
<L>"Tho' Cares have Wrinkles in my Forehead worn,</L>
<L>"I'll smiling bless, and mark the Day with white,</L>
<L>"That brought such hospitable Friends to Light;</L>
<L>"My native Brethren are in you supply'd,</L>
<L>"And former Blessings now again preside.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, lively, from his languid Bed he rose,</L>
<L>Free'd of his Pangs, and melancholy Woes,</L>
<L>Industrious Arts his active Hands could use;</L>
<L>He would the Bread of slothful Means refuse,</L>
<L>Them to his proper Livlihood he join'd,</L>
<L>Where leaden Speech unloads the lab'ring Mind,</L>
<L>And graven Words to distant Ages tell</L>
<L>What various Things in Times foregone befell:</L>
<L>As <HI>Mercury</HI> cuts thro' the yielding Sky,</L>
<L>So thro' the Work his nimble Fingers fly:</L>
<L>His novel Skill Spectators thronging drew,</L>
<L>Who haste the swift Compositer to view;</L>
<L>Not Men alone, but Maids of softer Air</L>
<L>And nicer Fancies, to the Room repair:</L>
<L>Pleas'd with such mild Impediments he frames,</L>
<L>As they Request, their dear enchanting Names,</L>
<L>To grace a Book, or feast a Lover's Eye,</L>
<L>Or tell Companions of their fancied Joy.</L>
<L>With Complaisance he still dismiss'd the Train,</L>
<L>None ever sought his Courtesy in vain:</L>
<L>Each transient fair one took her Name away,</L>
<L>But thee <HI>Maria</HI>—'Twas thy Doom to stay;</L>
<L>'Twas soon revers'd, the Work of his quick Hand,</L>
<L>Short did thy Name so gaily printed stand;</L>
<L>Both Hearts consent new Letters to compose,</L>
<L>And give to thine the pleasing Name of ROSE.</L>
</LG>

<L>Now here the Bard by his own Choice was ty'd,</L>
<L>(Renouncing further Rambling) to a Bride;</L>

<HI>Albion</HI> for <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> he resigns,</L>
<L>And now no more at <HI>Sylvia</HI>'s Loss repines:</L>
<L>Those youthful Wounds, that bled so freely there,</L>
<L><HI>Maria</HI> heals, more faithful, and as fair.</L>
<L>By this a Cure for former Ills was wrought,</L>
<L>But future to prevent employ'd his Thought:</L>
<L>Fix'd as he was far from his native Home,</L>
<L>Here to reside, and ne'er again to roam,</L>
<L>He counsels with himself what Means to use,</L>
<L>To live with Credit, and what Baits refuse:</L>
<L>First, Clerk to our Provincial Senate rais'd,</L>
<L>He found, besides the Stipend, he was prais'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now a greater Task he takes in Hand,</L>
<L>Which none but true Projectors understand.</L>
<L>What Pity 'tis they seldom live to taste</L>
<L>The Fruits of those pure Spirits that they waste!</L>
<L>For Works so hard and tedious, was it known</L>
<L>A Poet e'er did Poetry disown?</L>
<L>Or for a distant Livelihood give o'er</L>
<L>Those instant Pleasures that he felt before?</L>
<L>Yet so <HI>Aquila</HI> did—The rustic Toil,</L>
<L>To make firm Landings on a muddy Soil,</L>
<L>Erect a Ferry over <HI>Schuylkil</HI>'s Stream,</L>
<L>A Benefit to Thousands—Death to him!</L>

<L>Hard for the Pencil or the Pen to trace.</L>

<L>A short Hour's Walk from <HI>Delaware</HI> it lies</L>
<L>Due West, and which the City-Bounds comprise:</L>

<L>Now he, disguis'd, assumes the lab'ring Swain,</L>
<L>And looks as when he lately plough'd the Main.</L>
<L>Great Spirits thus can brook an humble Shew,</L>
<L>And unobserv'd beneath their Burthens grow:</L>
<L>Anon from their Obscurities to rise,</L>
<L>As Friends from Travels feed our wond'ring Eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But passing great Fatigues, Expence and Geer,</L>
<L>The Scene alone shall bear Description here.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Furlong from a Hill of short Ascent,</L>
<L>A level Plain has on the Stream Extent,</L>
<L>Not many Feet above the Waters rais'd,</L>
<L>But firm the Ground, and for its Aspect prais'd;</L>
<L>The ebbing Tide presents the Sight with Ooze,</L>
<L>And then some Pleasure of the View we lose;</L>
<L>But worst of all to bear, and sad to see,</L>
<L>At Winter's End the Floods from Frost break free;</L>
<L>The River's mighty Length, and downward Course,</L>
<L>Gives to the roaring Ice resistless Force;</L>
<L>Away the Causeways, Boats and Piles are borne,</L>
<L>And bord'ring Trees press'd down, or rudely torn,</L>
<L>The House endanger'd, and one Story drown'd,</L>
<L>And scarce a Means of Safety to be found:</L>
<L>And sometimes too, in Seasons warm and gay,</L>
<L>Great sudden Rains their Violence display,</L>
<L>Sweep off the Soil, and bring a different Kind,</L>
<L>And Marks of Ruin ever leave behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But neither breaking-Frost, or flooding Rains,</L>
<L>Destroy Projectors Hopes of Praise and Gains:</L>
<L>Nor ev'ry Year, do these their Pow'r exert;</L>
<L>Or what bold <HI>Charon</HI> could live here alert?</L>

<L>Now (leaving to the last, the pleasing Part</L>

Look on the Stream as it pacifick flows,</L>
<L>Which largely bending, more the Prospect shows,</L>
<L>A Summer-Sight, none lovelier can be seen,</L>
<L>And on the Shore a varied Growth of Green:</L>
<L>The Poplars high, erect their stately Heads,</L>
<L>The tawny Water-Beech more widely spreads;</L>
<L>The Linden strong in Breadth and Height, is there,</L>
<L>With Mulberry Leaves—And Trees with Golden Hair,</L>
<L>These, of a smaller Stem, like Filberds seem,</L>
<L>But flatter-leaf'd, and always love the Stream.</L>
<L>Here grows the jagged Birch: and Elm, whose Leaves</L>
<L>With Sides ill-pair'd the observing Eye perceives;</L>
<L>Yet nobly tall and great, it yields a Shade</L>
<L>In which cool Arbours might be fitly made:</L>
<L>Such is the Linden, such the Beech above,</L>
<L>Each in itself contains a little Grove.</L>
<L>Here Hickeries, and Oaks, and Ashes rise,</L>
<L>All diff'ring, but much more in Use than Size;</L>
<L>And Walnuts, with their yellow bitter Dyes.</L>
<L>The fragrant Sassafras enjoys a Place;</L>
<L>And Crabs, whose Thorns their scented Blossoms grace:</L>
<L>Parsimmons vex the Ground, so thick they shoot,</L>
<L>But pleasant is their late autumnal Fruit.</L>
<L>Tedious to name the shrubby Kinds below;</L>
<L>That mingled for Defence, in Clusters grow.</L>
<L>Two Plants remain, with Flow'rs unlike, both fair,</L>
<L>And both deserve th' ingenious Florist's Care:</L>
<L>The wild <HI>Althea,</HI> red, and white, and cream,</L>
<L>And scarlet <HI>Cardinal,</HI> with dazzling Gleam:</L>
<L>These tempt the Humming-Bird, whose misty Wings</L>
<L>Support him as he sucks the Flow'r and sings;</L>
<L>Low is his Voice, and simple Notes but few;</L>
<L>And oft' his little Body's lost to View:</L>

But his gay-colour'd Plumage forms a Show</L>
<L>As mix'd and vivid as the Sky's fair Bow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So great Variety no Tract can boast,</L>
<L>Of like Dimensions, as this narrow Coast.</L>
<L>The Botanist might here find Exercise;</L>
<L>And every curious Man regale his Eyes.</L>
<L>The Grass shines glist'ning of a lively Green:</L>
<L>And Northward hence the Quarry-Hill is seen,</L>
<L>Whose Top of late with verd'rous Pines is crown'd;</L>
<L>With Forest-Trees of various Kinds around.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And often here, the Clearness of the Stream</L>
<L>And cover'd Gravel-Banks, invite to swim:</L>
<L>But Anglers most their frequent Visits pay,</L>
<L>To toss Old-Wives, and Chubs, and Perch to Day;</L>
<L>And sometimes find the tasteful Trout their Prey.</L>
<L>Others with greater Pains their big Hooks bait;</L>
<L>But for the nobler Bite they seldom wait;</L>
<L>The Time to know their good Success adjourn,</L>
<L>And fail not by next Morning to return;</L>
<L>Then, hook'd, the weighty Rock-Fish draw to Shore</L>
<L>By Lines to Bushes ty'd, or those they moor.</L>

<L>How far th' Adventurer sped, now Muse relate,</L>

<L>He rais'd a Dwelling for himself and Friends,</L>
<L>And now his envy'd Labour almost ends:</L>
<L>He saw his Causeways firm above the Waves,</L>
<L>And nigh the Deeps, unless a Storm outbraves;</L>
<L>When Gusts unusual, strong with Wind and Rain,</L>
<L>Swell'd <HI>Schuylkil</HI>'s Waters o'er the humble Plain,</L>
<L>Sent hurrying all the Moveables afloat,</L>
<L>And drove afar, the needful'st Thing, the Boat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas then, that wading thro' the chilling Flood,</L>
<L>A cold ill Humour mingled with his Blood,</L>
<L>Convuls'd the Nerves, and shook the strugg'ling Frame,</L>
<L>'Till overpower'd by <HI>Febris</HI> raging Flame;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="004593_0011_100DA7BE982438B8" MS="y"/>
Which freezing Juices into boiling turn'd,</L>
<L>Scalded the Veins, and sore the Vitals burn'd.</L>
<L>Alternately the Frost and Fire took Place,</L>
<L>His Joints enfeebl'd, and made pale his Face.</L>
<L>Then soon Defluxions thro' the Bowels rush,</L>
<L>Nor stay for Nature's kind digesting Push.</L>
<L>Physicians try'd their Skill, his Head reliev'd,</L>
<L>And his lost Appetite to Strength retriev'd:</L>
<L>But all was Flatt'ry—So the Lamp decays,</L>
<L>And near its Exit gives an ardent Blaze.</L>

<L>Behind he left his Widow bath'd in Tears,</L>
<L>A Grief supportless to her tender Years:</L>
<L>Against her Breast their first-born Child inclines,</L>
<L>Its Father's Joy, and with its Mother pines:</L>

The grievous Waters wash me as I pray,</L>
<L>And horrid Winds enforce my Words away:</L>
<L>Thro' the hoarse Noise no pitying God can hear</L>
<L>The Winds, my Words and Sails in Pieces tear:</L>
<L>The Fault's unknown: Why should I bear such Woes?</L>
<L>Are all the Gods, as well as <HI>Caesar</HI> Foes?</L>
<L>Ah Wretch! what Hills of Water roll on high!</L>
<L>Just now, just now, you'd think they touch'd the Sky.</L>
<L>How deep the Vallies in the Ocean low'r!</L>

<L>The Seas and Skies alone attract the Sight,</L>

<L>And fill with spreading Sounds the distant Skies:</L>
<L>Sometimes the East-Wind gathers Strength from far,</L>
<L>And seems the Victor in the windy War:</L>
<L>Sometimes the West is present with his Pow'rs;</L>
<L>As fiercer <HI>Boreas</HI> from the Northern Shores:</L>
<L>Sometimes the South in dreadful Tempests blows;</L>
<L>Nor which to serve the troubled Ocean knows:</L>
<L>The Pilot's self, these Squalls desires, nor flies,</L>
<L>And from his Art still doubtful Evils rise.</L>
<L>Nothing but Death appears in frightful Forms;</L>
<L>No Hopes of Safety from such horrid Storms:</L>
<L>Ev'n whilst I speak, oppress'd beneath a Wave,</L>
<L>It proves at once a Winding-sheet and Grave.</L>
<L>No Ills like these my pious Consort knows,</L>
<L>She only grieves me as an absent Spouse;</L>
<L>Far from her Thoughts such dreadful Tempest be,</L>
<L>She knows not that I'm tost by Wind and Sea;</L>
<L>Before my Eyes she knows not Death to stand,</L>
<L>'Twas well I left her on the peaceful Land:</L>

<L>She being here, 'twould make a double Death:</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="004593_0015_100DA7C76C7ACB88"/>
Myself alone can all my Pains endure,</L>

<L>From Heav'ns huge Axle, what strong Noises came?</L>

<L>More light a Cannon Ball pursues its Course,</L>

<L>I fear not Death, my Life from Shipwreck guard,</L>
<L>Another Death I'll count a great Reward:</L>

<LG>
<L>WHEN the sad Image of the Night came on,</L>
<L>The last to me in <HI>Rome</HI>'s delightful Town;</L>
<L>When I recount my Joys and Pleasures there,</L>
<L>Then slides along my Cheeks a briny Tear.</L>
<L>The fatal Day had almost lost its Light,</L>
<L>Vail'd by the Curtains of the sable Night;</L>
<L><HI>Caesar</HI>'s allotted Hour was night at Hand,</L>
<L>When I must leave the sweet <HI>Ausonian</HI> Land.</L>
<L>How short the Space! Myself too unprepar'd,</L>
<L>To be from all my Joys at once debar'd.</L>
<L>No Thought of Servants, my Commands to wait,</L>
<L>Or kind Companions in my exil'd State:</L>
<L>So much did Sorrow all my Soul dismay,</L>
<L>I brought nor Cloaths, nor needful Things For Sea.</L>
<L>A silent Monument of Grief I stood,</L>
<L>With all the Pow'rs of human Sense subdu'd.</L>
<L>So he who meets the Wound loud Thunder gives,</L>
<L>Breathes still in Life, yet knows not that he lives.</L>
<L>But when, by Reas'ning, I dispel'd these Fears,</L>
<L>Strong were my Senses in the midst of Cares.</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="004593_0018_100DA7CE4B819268"/>
I speak to my sad Friends, and bid Adieu:</L>
<L>(Great Numbers now are dwindled into few.)</L>
<L>A thousand Things I said, a Thousand lost,</L>
<L>Whilst Tears stop'd my Complaints, and Speech (engross'd.</L>
<L>Around my Neck my tender Consort hung,</L>
<L>And tore my Soul with her complaining Tongue:</L>
<L>A Show'r of Tears run down her Cheeks apace,</L>
<L>Whilst Grief itself look'd lovely in her Face.</L>
<L>Far off in <HI>Lybia</HI> was my Daughter sent,</L>
<L>Entirely ign'rant of my Banishment.</L>
<L>A silent Funeral in the House appear'd,</L>
<L>And solemn Mourning round about was heard.</L>
<L>My Servants, touch'd with my Misfortunes, cry;</L>
<L>And little Children, scarcely knowing why.</L>
<L>So 'twas (if I great Things compare with small)</L>
<L>When burning <HI>Troy</HI> receiv'd its fatal Fall.</L>
<L>'Twas Night's high Noon, and <HI>Cynthia</HI>'s Horses fly</L>
<L>A downward Course along the glittering Sky.</L>
<L>Nor Voice of Men, nor snarling Dogs were heard,</L>
<L>And Nature's self in Silence now appear'd,</L>
<L>When from the Capitol I view'd th' Abodes,</L>
<L>And gilded Temples of the shining Gods.</L>
<L>In vain so near their Seats our Cottage stands,</L>
<L>No heav'nly Pow'r my Exile countermands:</L>
<L>Mine Eyes no more these spacious Domes must see,</L>
<L>Far, far remov'd must all these Prospects be.</L>
<L>The guarding Shield I now resume too late,</L>
<L>Sore wounded, and expos'd to abject Fate.</L>
<L>Yet, O ye Powers, who in <HI>Quirinus</HI> dwell,</L>
<L>Hear my strong Pray'rs, and take a last Farewel!</L>
<L>Unload the Ills great <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Anger bears,</L>
<L>And speak my Error in <HI>Augustus'</HI> Ears:</L>
<L>So may he find no wicked Crime I meant</L>
<L>To cause this Rage and grievous Punishment.</L>

If you're appeas'd, I'm made a full Amends;</L>
<L>Who can be wretched when the Gods are Friends?</L>
<L>When on my Knees this humble Pray'r I made,</L>
<L>My Wife, in Sighing, stop'd me as I pray'd;</L>
<L>Prostrate on Earth her tender Body lay,</L>
<L>And her loose Locks about her Shoulders play:</L>
<L>Her trembling Breast with my Misfortunes pain'd,</L>
<L>Against the adverse <HI>Lares</HI> she complain'd;</L>
<L>Yet they unmindful, dull and stupid grown,</L>
<L>Nor hear her Sighs, nor answer to her Moan.</L>
<L>Now the quick Night, precipitant of Stay,</L>
<L>Deny'd the Happiness of long Delay.</L>
<L>Turn'd from the Pole was th' <HI>Erymanthian</HI> Bear,</L>
<L>And all the Symptoms of the Morn appear.</L>
<L>What could I do? 'Twas the important Night,</L>
<L>The last sad Hours of my commanded Flight!</L>
<L>My Country's Love still held me to the Place,</L>
<L>Whilst some kind Friends wou'd tell my shorten'd Space.</L>
<L>Why urge ye me? oft to my Friends I said,</L>
<L>You push my Fate too soon upon my Head;</L>
<L>Knew you the cruel Shores to which I go,</L>
<L>You wou'd not hasten my Departure so.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft I resolv'd I would my Journey take,</L>
<L>And touch'd the Threshold thrice, and thrice came back.</L>
<L>The Thoughts of Stay my willing Feet obey'd,</L>
<L>But a slow Progress in my Exile made.</L>
<L>A Thousand Times I bid the last Farewell,</L>
<L>Whilst I recal a Thousand Things to tell.</L>
<L>Departing, I the last dear Kiss repeat;</L>
<L>And kissing on my hurry'd Senses cheat.</L>
<L>The same soft Things I speak, and speak again,</L>
<L>Whilst my poor Children in my Sight remain.</L>
<L>But say, my Friends, why shou'd I haste away?</L>
<L>In Banishment 'tis just to make delay.</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="004593_0020_100DA7D3F17E3250"/>
Why shou'd I swift to barbarous <HI>Soythia</HI> run,</L>
<L>And fly the Lands I once cou'd call my own;</L>
<L>Banish'd my Country, banish'd from my Wife,</L>
<L>My House, my Children; all the Joys of Life?</L>
<L>No more my longing Eyes my Friends shall see,</L>
<L>Friends bound with a <HI>Thesean</HI> Faith to me.</L>
<L>Yet let me use the short allotted Space,</L>
<L>And end my Parting with a close Embrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I must resign, 'tis Death to stop my Flight,</L>
<L>This last sad Hour must tear me from your Sight.</L>
<L>I left my Words imperfect on my Tongue,</L>
<L>And on each Friend with close Embraces hung.</L>
<L>But whilst we speak and weep, the Morning-Star</L>
<L>Aloft in Heav'n, scarce peep'd thro' twilight Air.</L>
<L>How grievous was the first Approach of Day,</L>
<L>That forc'd Wife, Children, Friends, and all away?</L>
<L>Such piercing Pain, my Friends, I felt for you,</L>
<L>This last sad Time I bad you all adieu,</L>
<L>As if my Limbs in adverse Halves were torn,</L>
<L>One part to stay, and one to Exile born.</L>
<L>So <HI>Priam</HI> look'd, when <HI>Greeks</HI> in Arms came down</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now the loud Moans of all my Friends arise,</L>
<L>Deaf the quick Ear, and sadden all the Skies:</L>
<L>My wretched Breast with my mad Hands I strike,</L>
<L>Whilst my dear Consort hung about my Neck:</L>
<L>The pearly Tears run down her beauteous Cheeks,</L>
<L>She clasp'd me fast, and thus in Passion speaks;</L>
<L>They cannot; No, they shall not force from me</L>
<L>The Man I love; we both will trust the Sea.</L>
<L>Since thou'rt exil'd, I'll be an Exile too,</L>
<L>And with thee into barbarous <HI>Soythia</HI> go.</L>

When thou art drove by <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Wrath away,</L>
<L>My Piety commands me not to stay;</L>
<L>That shall itself to me a <HI>Caesar</HI> prove,</L>
<L>And nothing, nothing shall divide our Love.</L>
<L>She try'd such Words, and try'd 'em oft before:</L>
<L>I lov'd too well to take her from the Shore,</L>
<L>And unconsenting from her Presence stole,</L>
<L>With my torn Hair, my Face and Body foul:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mad with the Thoughts, she falls, and faints and dies,</L>
<L>And on the Floor a wretched Object lies.</L>
<L>Soon her dead Senses start again to Life,</L>
<L>Yet left her Soul confus'd with Love and Grief.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length she rose from off the dusty Ground,</L>
<L>Bewail'd herself, and then the <HI>Lares</HI> round:</L>
<L>No Help, says she, these houshold Gods afford;</L>
<L>They neither banish me, nor save my Lord:</L>
<L>And, why to add to my Misfortune more,</L>
<L>Am I deny'd to reach the <HI>Pontean</HI> Shore?</L>
<L>Why was my Heart in Hymen's Fetters ty'd</L>
<L>Yet forc'd from all the Pleasures of a Bride?</L>
<L>Then my lov'd Name she often would repeat,</L>
<L>Our tender Joys and Love, and envious Fate.</L>
<L>She griev'd as much my Absence and Exile</L>
<L>As if my Corps had grac'd the funeral Pile.</L>
<L>Herself half dead, was languishing for me;</L>
<L>And I, dear Wife, still do the same for thee:</L>
<L>But may'st thou live to help me by thy Care,</L>
<L>Since <HI>Caesar</HI> and the Fates so cruel are.</L>

<L>The Star that o're th' <HI>Arcadian</HI> Bear presides,</L>

<L>NO sooner KEITH was from <HI>Virginia</HI> come,</L>
<L>But publick Business forc'd him still from Home:</L>
<L>To Woods remote he took a painful Way,</L>
<L>Nor less Provision made than for the Sea.</L>
<L>Those who for kind Respect or Pleasure went,</L>
<L>Thought each beneath a Tree to pitch his Tent;</L>
<L>Eat his own Bisket, Hams, and private Store,</L>
<L>Drink the cool Spring, and hardly dream'd of more.</L>
<L>But (false to all our wretched Thoughts) we found</L>
<L>A House capacious, and a fertile Ground:</L>
<L>Luxurious Dishes grac'd the loaded Board,</L>
<L>With all the Bounties of rich Nature stor'd.</L>
<L>The flowing Cups with sprightly Liquor smil'd,</L>
<L>And pleasant Talk the running Hours beguil'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>C—DGE to thee we owe this gen'rous Treat,</L>
<L>And, forc'd to Praise, thy spreading Name repeat.</L>
<L>The <HI>'Delphian</HI> Town shall know how well we fare,</L>
<L>Since we are sure to feed less sumptuous there.</L>

<L>In thee united all the Joys of Life,</L>
<L>And choice Endowments of a matchless Wife;</L>
<L>Whate'er Perfection is thy Ser's Boast,</L>
<L>Was known in thee, and by thy Death is lost.</L>
<L>How shall the Muse dilate on such a Theme,</L>
<L>Where Heav'n, by robbing us, deserts its Claim:</L>
<L>A Resignation must the Loss requite;</L>

<L>Each fleeting Hour as if the last in Life:</L>
<L>No Word from her e're stole upon the Ear</L>
<L>But what an Angel might delight to hear:</L>
<L>Actions receiv'd a Tincture from her Heart,</L>
<L>Unmix'd with Fraud, and unimprov'd by Art:</L>
<L>So chaste: She being dead. is only more</L>

<L>Devout as Saints in dying Raptures are,</L>

<L>Unyok'd, unmated with her secret Love:</L>

<L>Who their own Lives in Fragrancy consume:</L>

<L>Bright'ned by Rays shot from th' All-beauteous One:</L>
<L>All the Perfection of the lovely Sex</L>

<L>Grac'd with the Charms of native Innocence,</L>
<L>The slow Disease still urg'd her Sickness on,</L>
<L>And active Life stood waiting to be gone:</L>

<L>And GOD himself was present to her View;</L>
<L>In soft'ned Verse his endless Praise she sung,</L>

<L>For how can a Poet, who never gets Chink,</L>
<L>And makes all his Business to write or to think,</L>
<L>Pay Money for Goods; 'tis too weighty indeed, Sir,</L>
<L>For tho' of your Vessel he stands much in Need, Sir:</L>
<L>Except you take Verses, and Pennyworths of Praise,</L>
<L>He'll remain your poor Debtor to the End of his Days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But the Way of the Country, is, Goods and Discount;</L>
<L>And, Sir, if you'll reckon to what 'twill amount:</L>
<L>In sweet Panegyricks, soft Strains, or rough Satyr,</L>
<L>Such Goods as lie by me; Why then, Sir, have at her.</L>
<L>Or if you insist on't, e're <HI>Sol</HI> flies his round,</L>
<L>I'll hunt for a Mine, Sir, and pay when 'tis found.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, if you despise the Proposal that's fair,</L>
<L>And refuse to commit the poor Boat to my Care;</L>
<L>May she rest in the Bed, Sir, that Fate seems to give her,</L>
<L>And fly the Mishaps of a boysterous River;</L>
<L>Since she's swamp'd, and escap'd, to be wreek'd by a Rock,</L>
<L>Make a Palace for Bull-Frogs, and rot in the Dock.</L>

<LG>
<L>TO thee, sweet Bard, my Muse attempts to sing;</L>
<L>To thee she owes the Practice of her Wing:</L>
<L>Great the Example; but the Fault is mine,</L>
<L>She cannot bound in Flights so high as thine:</L>
<L>For in dejected Fancy thou canst soar</L>
<L>To loftiest Scenes, to the remotest Shore;</L>
<L>The widest Stretch of Thought thy Numbers show,</L>
<L>Immortal Springs in thy smooth Cadence flow.</L>
<L>Thy soft Complaints affect my Heart with Grief,</L>
<L>While in the self same Words I find Relief:</L>
<L>A pleasing Sorrow agitates my Veins,</L>
<L>When such a melting <HI>Israelite</HI> complains:</L>
<L>I sympathize; for I have known the same,</L>
<L>And felt in Absence (of the Cause) the Flame;</L>
<L>Have been sequest'red from my native Soil,</L>
<L>(Tho' less susceptible of such a Toil)</L>
<L>Enough to guess the Burthen thou dost bear,</L>
<L>And, like a Friend, participate a Share.</L>
<L>But in such Phrase thy Story is display'd,</L>
<L>In Colours beauteous by an Artist laid;</L>
<L>That while I pity, Joy alternate steals</L>
<L>On all the Sentiments thy Pen reveals,</L>
<L>Ev'n to a Crime: Because they please so well,</L>
<L>I'm almost glad for what has thee befel.</L>
<L>Were I to taste like Ills, and have the Muse</L>
<L>That tells my Friend what moving Words to chuse,</L>
<L>I'd not the Curse for such a Bliss refuse.</L>

<L>So <HI>Dido,</HI> while <HI>Aeneas</HI> sung his Woes,</L>
<L>With pleasing Sadness her full Bosom rose;</L>
<L>Her brimfull Heart found Passage at her Eyes,</L>
<L>Where Love return'd to symphonize her Sighs.</L>
<L>I bring a Female Simile, to shew</L>
<L>The ductile State thy Song reduc'd me to.</L>
</LG>

<L>But let us rouse the manly Will, my Friend;</L>
<L>Where shall this soft delusive Story end?</L>
<L>Resolve, resume thy wonted Strength, and try</L>
<L>If thou or thy Adversities must die:</L>
<L>Forget 'em all, or wave them for a while,</L>
<L>(Ah, why must Rhime renew the blissful Isle!)</L>
<L>Wise <HI>T—r,</HI> and facetious <HI>F—h,</HI> will strive,</L>
<L>And I, depend, to keep our Friend alive.</L>
<L>If Recreations, of a rustick Kind,</L>

<L>With Pleasure we beheld, O <HI>Delaware!</HI></L>
<L>Thy woody Banks become the Muses Care;</L>
<L>Thy docile Youth were with her Beauty fir'd,</L>
<L>And Folly, Vice and Ignorance retir'd:</L>
<L>And had but <HI>Myris</HI> liv'd, we hop'd to see</L>
<L>A new <HI>Arcadia</HI> to arise on thee.</L>
<L>Mourn all ye Streams; mourn all ye gentle Floods,</L>
<L>And thou great Genius of these endless Woods;</L>
<L>Ye <HI>Sylvan</HI> Pow'rs that danc'd the Groves along,</L>
<L>And all who us'd to wonder at his Song;</L>
<L>His Song no more sounds thro' the rural Glade,</L>
<L>Nor Joy diffuses thro' the secret Shade.</L>
<L>Mourn ye fair Nymphs; mourn all ye faithful Swains,</L>
<L>His late belov'd Companions on the Plains;</L>
<L>And while your willing Tears unbidden flow</L>
<L>Let me be Sharer in the gen'rous Woe;</L>
<L>Such Woe as his own Words could best impart,</L>
<L>For <HI>Myris</HI> had a Key to every Heart.</L>
<L>But Love, the sweetest Passion of the Mind,</L>
<L>Delight of Heav'n, and Blessing to Mankind,</L>
<L>His favourite Theme: Oh <HI>Myris,</HI> who like you,</L>
<L>Could talk of Love could paint it half so true!</L>
<L>With soft Address thou couldst persuade the Fair;</L>
<L>With heav'nly Rhetorick thou couldst charm Despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou, once dear Partner of his Marriage Joys,</L>
<L>This World no Blessings give, but Time destroys;</L>
<L>Asswage thy Grief, compose thy troubled Mind,</L>
<L>Two lovely Pledges he has left behind:</L>
<L>May gracious Heav'n smile on their infant Years,</L>
<L>And make amends for all the Mother's Tears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, grateful Muse, thy mournful Labour cease,</L>
<L>And let his honour'd Ashes rest in Peace:</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="004593_0054_100DA82378A290D0"/>
Endless his many Vertues to rehearse,</L>
<L>A Task unequal to thy humble Verse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh <HI>Philadelphia!</HI> now with conscious Shame,</L>
<L>His Enemies submit to his just Fame:</L>
<L>Their Envy is in Admiration lost,</L>
<L>Taught by thy gen'rous Sons, his Worth they boast,</L>
<L>And load, with Praise deserv'd, that hospitable Coast.</L>

<HEAD>On the Death of <HI>AQUILA ROSE,</HI> by a young Woman.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FAME, thou transporting, rude, uncertain Sound,</L>
<L>Now fly for Haste, and be forever sped;</L>
<L>Thou canst no more give such a vocal Wound,</L>
<L>As this sad Truth, <HI>Aquila Rose</HI> is dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Dead to our Eyes, and never to return,</HI></L>
<L><HI>While faded Laurels</HI> Schuylkil <HI>Rocks adorn.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, now, no more, ye shady Hills an Bow'rs,</L>
<L>Shall your droop'd Heads rejoice to hear those Lays</L>
<L>That flow'd so sweetly from those lofty Pow'rs,</L>
<L>So near ally'd to the <HI>Orphean</HI> Bays.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Ab me, ye Woods and Shores assist to mourn,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And faded Laurels</HI> Schuylkil <HI>Rocks adorn.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye glitt'ring Springs that beautify the Shore</L>
<L>With warbling Notes, to meet the rowling Stream,</L>
<L>Go bid your Fountains lend their utmost store,</L>
<L>To pay their Tribute to so just a Theme,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>With mournful Sound around his silent Urn,</HI></L>
<L><HI>While faded Laurels</HI> Schuylkil <HI>Rocks adorn.</HI></L>
</LG>

<PB N="56" REF="004593_0055_100DA825B250C0A8"/>
<L>Ah! why so sad? ye Shepherds, why so mute?</L>
<L>Are all your wretched Pipes forever fled?</L>
<L>Now breathless Silence dwells on ev'ry Lute,</L>
<L>To find the Author of their Musick dead.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Let us lament, and ev'ry Echo mourn,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And faded Laurels</HI> Schuylkil <HI>Rocks adorn.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Immortal Musick, bright victorious Palms,</L>
<L>Let your melodious indiscording Songs,</L>
<L>So tune our Lays with your caelestial Charms,</L>
<L>To warm our Bosoms and inspire our Tongues,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>That we may meet around</HI> Aquila's <HI>Urn,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And the dear Bard in brightest Numbers mourn.</HI></L>
