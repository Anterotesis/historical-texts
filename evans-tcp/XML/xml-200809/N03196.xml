<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S there is no Salvation but in Jesus Christ, nor any other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby they must be Saved, so it must needs be the greatest Mercy to Mankind to en∣joy that Gospel which reveals this Savi∣our, &amp; the Way to Eternal Life by him. And as those who are thus highly favoured, should with all thankfulness acknowledge this Sovereign Di∣stinction of divine Grace, in revealing these things un∣to them, so they ought, and if they have the true Spirit of Christ and his Gospel, will pity those of their Fellow Creatures who are destitute of the Means of Light, and are perishing for lack of Vision.</P>
<P>And it is just matter of Lamentation to think that when we are so remarkably Blessed with the Light and Grace of the Gospel, there should be so many Tribes and Nations of the <HI>Aborigines</HI> of this Land, within or just upon our Borders, who do still walk in Heath∣enish Darkness, and dwell in the Region of the Shadow of Death, with little or no Light springing up unto them, unless what some of them have by the <HI>Romish Missionaries,</HI> which Light is but Darkness.</P>
<P>And it is doubtless to our Reproach, as betraying a want of that Gratitude to Christ, and Love and Charity to Mankind, which his Grace teaches, that there has been no more done by US for the Propagation of the Gospel among them. Especially when we consider how much we have been outdone by the <HI>French,</HI> and those of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> in this Matter. For how shall we answer it, that when they have been at so much Cost
<PB N="ii" REF="003867_0004_100206FA1AC86A30"/>
and Pains for Propagating their Superstition, we have been at so little for the promoting that Religion of Jesus, which before God and the Father is pure &amp; undefiled.</P>
<P>But <HI>how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a Preacher? and how shall they Preach except they be sent?</HI> To which I may add, How shall they be sent unless God sends them? For Men qualified for this Service are as it were with one Consent making their Excuse. And it is God alone that can incline the Hearts of any to engage in such a difficult and Self-de∣nying Service. And whenever any Persons are inspired with so much Zeal for the Honour and Interest of Christ, tender Pity and fervent Charity to those uncivilized as well as ungospelized People, as to live among them and Preach the Gospel to them, God must have the Glory of it.</P>
<P>And such an One we trust Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> is, who notwithstanding the agreeable Business he was in as a Tutor of <HI>Yale-College,</HI> and his having as fair a pros∣pect as any Candidate for the Ministry whatsoever, to have an agreeable Settlement in any of the Churches that should need a Pastor; yet voluntarily devoted him∣self to the Service of Christ and of the poor <HI>Indians;</HI> and more especially those that are at or near <HI>Houssatonnoc.</HI></P>
<P>And now with respect to <HI>this Tribe</HI> of Indians, their Number, Scituation, and other Circumstances relating to them; and particularly the Manner how they came first to be disposed to receive the Gospel, and how Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> as a Minister, and Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> as a School Master, were introduced among them, and enter∣tained by them, and the hopeful Prospects there are of the Gospel's spreading and prevailing in those dark and ignorant Parts of the Land, will best appear in a par∣ticular Narrative hereof given by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Stephen Williams</HI> of <HI>Springfield,</HI> in a Letter of <HI>June 24 1735.</HI> to a Gentleman then in <HI>Boston,</HI> which for the Enter∣tainment of the Reader, is here inserted, and is as follows. viz.</P>

<PB N="iii" REF="003867_0005_10020711B222EE30"/>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Concern you seemed to have on your Mind, for the Welfare of the <HI>Aboriginal</HI> Na∣tives of this Country (when I last saw you at <HI>Boston</HI>) is the Occasion, of my troubling of you with some Account of the good Disposition there is in the River Indians (as they are called) to receive the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. And here before I proceed, it is needful to inform you, that this Clan of Indians (whose Prince or Chief Sagamore was the late <HI>Etouocoam,</HI> one of the Indian Kings that went to <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Queen Ann's</HI> Reign) live upon <HI>Hudson's River,</HI> below <HI>Albany</HI>; and their Bounds extends East, so as to reach to <HI>Houssatonnoc</HI> (which is the South-West part of our Government) and to a Place called <HI>Weteoge</HI> (that is the North-West of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Government) so that thay live in the three Governments. They are the most nu∣merous Tribe of Indians that I am acquainted with. They can raise (I am told) three or four hundred Men. But having thus informed you, I proceed to tell you, that there live several Fa∣milies of these Indians at <HI>Houssatonnoc</HI>; amongst whom there are two Indians of note, the one is named <HI>Cuncaupot,</HI> the other <HI>Umpecheny. Cuncaupot</HI> has been honoured by Governor BELCHER with a Captain's Commission, and <HI>Umpecheny</HI> with a Lieu∣tenant's. When they received their Commissions (which was at <HI>Springfield,</HI> in <HI>May</HI> 1734) I made them a Visit, and found them grave, desirable, prudent Men; the Captain then 42 Years of Age, the Lieutenant 38. In Conversation with them, I found that Capt <HI>Cuncaupot</HI> was apprehensive that the Religion of his Fore-fathers was not right. But yet he did not know how to think well of the Christian Religion, because the Christians (many of them) lead immoral Lives I improved the short time I had with them, in discoursing a∣bout
<PB N="iv" REF="003867_0006_10020700A0EECD28"/>
Religion, and removing their Objections, and asked them when I left them, whether they should be willing to see me at their own Country? They said they should, and would go home and tell their People what had been said by me, and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hopkins,</HI> who was with me part of the time of conversing with them. I informed his Excellency Governor BELCHER, and the Ho∣nourable and Reverend Commissioners of the In∣dian Affairs, of this matter, who encouraged and directed my going up to see them. And in <HI>July</HI> 1734, I went up to their Country, accompanied with the Reverend Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> of <HI>Westfield.</HI> Capt. <HI>Cuncaupot,</HI> and his Kinsman Lieut <HI>Umpecheny,</HI> ma∣nifested great Joy at seeing us. They gathered their People together the next Day, after we got to <HI>Houssatonnoc,</HI> with whom we discoursed about Religious Matters. They told us they would con∣sider what had been said, and give us an Answer in four Days; the most of which time was spent in consulting together, considering and weighing what had been said to them. When we met them again, I preached a short Sermon to them, which was interpreted Sentence by Sentence. They gave good Attention to what was said. After the Exercise was over, all that were present (which was the <HI>Houssatonnoc</HI> Families) gave in their Names to us, with their desire that some Body might be sent to instruct and teach them the Christian Re∣ligion: Upon which I gave them a Belt of Wam∣pum, which they received as a Pledge, that I would do their Message to the Governour, &amp;c. It would be too tedious, to give you an Account how they managed themselves in their Debates on what was offered to them; and what Argu∣ments (we understood) were urged for or against receiving the Christian Religion. But I can't omit informing you, we were told, that an Indian (whose Name is <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> and who has since made
<PB N="v" REF="003867_0007_1002663182508B68"/>
a Profession of the Christian Religion, and received Baptism) offered thus to his Countrymen, viz. <HI>The Indians</HI> (says he) <HI>continue still in their Heathenism, notwithstanding the Gospel has been bro't so near them, and they are greatly diminished; so that</HI> (says he) <HI>since my remembrance, there were Ten Indians, where there is now One: But the Christians greatly increase and multiply, and spread over the Land; let us there∣fore leave our former Courses and become Christians,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Soon after my return home I went to <HI>Boston,</HI> and waited upon His Excellency and the Honourable Commissioners; who were so satisfied with the ac∣count given them, that they desired the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bull</HI> and me, to look out some suitable Person, to be employ'd as a Missionary, among that People. We undertook the Affair; and Divine Providence led us to the learned, pious &amp; ingenious Mr. <HI>John Sargent,</HI> one of the Tutors of <HI>Yale College,</HI> whom God had inclined to such a self-denying, difficult Service. He went up to <HI>Houssatonnoc</HI> in <HI>Octob.</HI> 1734, accompanied by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bull,</HI> to introduce him. When Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> arrived at <HI>Houssatonnoc,</HI> the Indians immediately set up a School-house, and a considerable number of them began to learn their Primers. Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> (who is one of the most sui∣table Persons for such business, that I know of) was very agreable to the Indians, got a great interest in their Affections, so that the Captain &amp; Lieutenant each of them, sent a Son with him to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> tho' at an Hundred Miles distance, to live with him the Winter Season (for Mr <HI>Sargent</HI> returned to Col∣lege to take care of the Senior Class). When Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> came away, Mr. <HI>Timothy Woodbridge</HI> went up to keep the School, who spent the Winter with them, who has done very good Service in bringing them on in their Reading, and in instructing them Principles of the Christian Religion. He taught them the Catechism of Dr. <HI>Watts.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="003867_0008_10026634057314A0"/>In the Winter past, the whole Nation of the Ri∣ver Indians met by their Delegates at <HI>Houssatonnoc</HI> to examine what the <HI>Houssatonnoc</HI> Indians were do∣ing. Capt. <HI>Cuncaupot,</HI> and Lieut. <HI>Umpecheny</HI> were fearful they should be frowned upon, and have Ob∣jections cast in their way, which they should not be able to remove, and therefore sent to some of the Ministers desiring they would come up. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Hopkins</HI> and I went up in the middle of Win∣ter to see them. There were assembled together One hundred and fifty or Two hundred Persons, Young &amp; Old; and among them <HI>Corlair,</HI> the chief Sachem of the whole Nation. I preached two Ser∣mons to them on the Sabbath. It was one of the gravest, and most attentive Auditories that ever I preached to. We had divers Conferences with the Indians, and read to them a Letter from the Hon. <HI>John Stoddard,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and endeavoured to answer their Objections, &amp;c. And so far satisfied those that came from other Places, that they thanked us for the pains we had taken; and desired Mr. <HI>Wood∣bridge</HI> might continue among them, and that Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> would return to them, and said they would give an account to their several Towns, of what we had offered to them, yea gave us Encouragement that they would as a Nation submit to Instruction. Soon after we left them, a pleuretick Fever seized several of them, and two of them died with it: When they were Sick, they desired Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> the School-master to pray with &amp; for them. And those that died (before their Death) desired they might be buried in the Christian Burying-place, and after the English manner: And according to their desire, they were; and without the Indian How∣lings and Lamentations and Ceremonies.</P>
<P>Sometime in <HI>February</HI> last, they sent a Letter to the Ministers that had visited them, which was dicta∣ted by them, tho' written by an Englishman: in it they have these Expressions, <HI>We do humbly thank
<PB N="vii" REF="003867_0009_1002663798DBA5C0"/>
you for your care and kindness towards us in instruct∣ing us in the Christian Religion; which we acknow∣ledge to be the best Religion in the World; and the Religion which we intend to stand by &amp; follow as long as we live: Altho' there are a great many difficulties in the way, yet we have no thought of giving out,</HI> &amp;c. This was signed by <HI>Cuncaupot, Umpecheny,</HI> and se∣veral others. In the Spring Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> returned to them again, and was received by them with a great deal of Joy. And he writes to me thus, viz. <HI>I find</HI> (I think) <HI>a better Disposition in the Indians here, towards Christianity, than I left them in. The Scho∣lars, many of them, have made considerable Progress in their Learning: And the Number of them is increased to near Forty. There is Business enough for two Men,</HI> &amp;c. Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> in a Letter tells me, that se∣veral Indians from other Plantations have come, and joined to them.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you a short and imperfect Account of an Affair, that I have been something concerned in; and which has cost me, with the other Ministers, some hundreds of Miles travel. I have been solicitous for the Welfare of the poor Heathen, ever since I was a Prisoner with them, and have with Concern observed the little prospect there has been of bringing any of them to receive the Protestant Religion, by our Missionaries at the Forts, where the Indians make but short stays, and are either drunk or busy about their Trade, all the while they tarry. And the Indians that frequent our Truck-Houses, are generally such as are poi∣sioned by the Jesuits, who have a great ascendant over them; as the Rev. Mr. <HI>Seccombe</HI> observes, in a Letter I have seen of his. But I can't but think, there is a hopeful prospect of much Good being done to these River Indians, if prudent Measures are pursued: For they are well disposed to receive the Christian Religion; have never been poisoned by the Jesuits (for their Scituation is such, that the
<PB N="viii" REF="003867_0010_1002070328B92FA8"/>
Jesuits can't come among them, without passing by <HI>Albany</HI>) There are among them several Persons of good Morals, remarkable for their Truth, Justice, yea and Temperance (tho' Intemperance is the Indians National Vice). They have an Affection for the English, especially for those who take pains to Instruct them. Their Children are desirous to learn to Read, &amp;c—Are very mannerly since they have been at School. I don't know what a Fund the Commissioners have to support their Missiona∣ries, but Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> and Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> seem very willing to spend and be spent in this good Work, if they can be subsisted so as to be enabled to go on with it. Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> in his last Letter to me ex∣presses himself thus, <HI>I hope the Commissioners will support Mr.</HI> Woodbridge <HI>and me here, so as that we can attend upon the Business without Distraction; for I hope we shall find a Door continually open to serve God and Mankind to some good Effect.</HI> And I am satisfied that the honourable the Commissioners will be willing, if they have a Fund sufficient to do it, and to answer their other necessary Charges at <HI>Na∣tick,</HI> &amp;c. But I can't but hope (if the Fund is not sufficient) that God will raise up Friends, &amp; increase the Stock, since such a wide, and (I hope) <HI>effectual Door is opened,</HI> and God has led to so suitable a Person as the worthy Mr. <HI>Sargent,</HI> who has told me, he should choose to serve his Redeemer in such Ser∣vice, if there was a prospect of Success, rather than any other Way. The difficulty of the Service, the hardship he must undergo, dwelling in the Wilder∣ness, and out of the Way of his learned Acquain∣tance, don't dishearten and discourage him. He is a Gentleman of such Parts and Learning, and so remarkable for his Piety, that any of our desti∣tute Churches would be fond of him, but he will not allow any of them, to think of diverting him from the good Work he is engaged in.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="003867_0011_100266392E635DC0"/>I have already exceeded the bounds of a Letter, but if what I have said, be any ways grateful to you, or occasion the thanksgiving of any unto God, I shall heartily rejoyce. I have endeavoured to give you a plain Narrative of Things; and you may make what Improvement of it you please. You yourself, will easily overlook my plain way of Writing: but you must not expect that what I write will be entertainment for the curious, that are not possessed of your Candour.</P>

And therefore with Dr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s Allowance, I will presume to publish some Paragraphs out of them; asking the Gentlemen's Pardon for such a Freedom.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Though I am not so happy as to have much per∣sonal Acquaintance with you, yet your known Character in general, and especially your Relation to the Affair I have been ingaged in, has made me hope, I shall have your Pardon for the Trouble I now give you.</P>
<P>'Tis but lately that I have returned from <HI>Houssa∣tonnoc</HI>; and I doubt not but you will rejoyce to be informed of the happy Success, God has been pleased to bless the Endeavours with, that have been used to convert the Heathen there to the Christian Faith. The Design has hitherto succeed∣ed beyond Expectation. They are I think now resolved to be Christians, and have an earnest de∣sire to be taught. The fondness they shew for me is surprising; and considering how much a Stran∣ger
<PB N="x" REF="003867_0012_10020708A64B0A20"/>
I am to them, their own barbarous Education, and how little I have done to win them, there ap∣pears something more than humane in it.</P>
<P>I am very willing (if the Gentlemen Commissio∣ners please) to devote my Life to the Service of their Souls. If God give success in it, it will be the great∣est satisfaction to me.— There is now, and I hope will be Work enough for two: I wish therefore Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> may be maintained there with me.</P>
<P>I am sensible that <HI>One Hundred Pounds</HI> will but just pay the necessary Charges of living: for the Ne∣cessaries of Life, are and must be dear in that re∣mote part of the Country. But I make my self easy in that matter, assuring my self, that (if there be Money) the Gentlemen betrusted with that affair, will do what is reasonable. Money alone is no temptation to me at all, to devote my self to such a Life, yet 'tis but reasonable, I think, to expect to be supported, so as to have no other care, than to attend the business I shall go about.</P>
<P>Some of the <HI>Indians</HI> (I perceive) have a mind to be baptized: <HI>Cuncaupot</HI> especially, who appears to me, to be well qualified for it. I have therefore tho't it would be convenient I should be Ordained speedily; at lest as soon as I am dismissed from the concerns of College. I would gladly be informed, whether it wilt be expected I should come to <HI>Boston</HI> for that purpose. To be Ordained here will be more convenient for me, and less expensive.</P>
<P>The Lads I brought down with me, lived here last Winter upon my Credit. The Charges have amounted to something considerable; too much for me, under my present Circumstances, to bear alone; tho' were I able, I should gladly bestow my Money that way.—</P>
<P>If you will be pleased to return a Line in answer to these, I shall esteem it a great honour, and fa∣vour done to</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MR. <HI>Woodbridge,</HI> Indian School-master at <HI>Hous∣satonnoc,</HI> upon some necessary business, left his School, a few days, and has been with us. And the account he gave is so encouraging, that I am sen∣sible it will be grateful to you, and therefore send it.</P>
<P>He informs me that several of the <HI>Houssatonnoc</HI> Indians have lately been to the Westward as far as <HI>Siscohannah,</HI> which they say is six Hundred Miles, and upon their return they say, that the Indians, thro' that large space, are generally dissatisfied with their own ways of Religion; and are disposed to inquire after some other way of Salvation, than ever they have been acquainted with.</P>
<P>He informs me further, that the River Indians (of which those at <HI>Houssatonnoc</HI> are a part) fre∣quently visit their Brethren at <HI>Houssatonnoc,</HI> take great notice of what is doing there; none of them oppose it, they generally approve of it: and many of them express their designs of coming to settle there; and some have put such a design in execu∣tion already, and are upon the spot: So that the number of Scholars, now actually under Instruction is upwards of Forty. And he adds, that he is per∣swaded, if the Indians could be accommodated with a proper quantity of Land, there would, in a little time, be a Congregation of several Hundreds of them worshiping GOD there.</P>
<P>That the Indians at <HI>Houssatonnoc</HI> continue in a fixed resolution to seek after knowledge in the Christian Religion, and to live in the practice of it; and have made great proficiency for the time.</P>
<P>That Capt. <HI>Cuncaupot</HI> seems to be overjoy'd to see the good disposition there is in his Brethren, to em∣brace the Christian Religion. Religion seems evi∣dently to be next his Heart: And he, with some others of them, desire to be baptized. —</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="003867_0014_1002663E47E74CD8"/>That Lieut. <HI>Umpecheny</HI>'s Wife and others, have wept more than once, upon heating divine Truths: And she especially has her Heart very much upon this Affair. She is also greatly engaged in learning to read: She will not fail of reading as often as any Scholar; and urges that she may read a little further, and a little further; so that Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> tells me, it grieves him to the very Heart, that he is obliged almost to force her from him, that he may have time to hear the rest of the Scholars. Other Women there are also, who discover much of the same good disposition, <HI>viz.</HI> the Captain's Wise, the Lieutenant's Wife's Sister, &amp;c.</P>
<P>He further informs me, that there came an In∣dian, a little while ago, from <HI>Hudson</HI>'s River, named <HI>Nompeh,</HI> about Thirty Years old, a Man of very singular Gravity, and began to learn to Read; he knew his Letters when he came, and that was all: He applied himself to the business with the utmost attention, and has made great progress &amp;c.—</P>
<P>These things give us reason to hope that the Hand of GOD is in, and his blessing upon that Affair. That it may succeed to the saving benefit of those poor Indians, is the ardent desire of</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Such a general inclination &amp; desire as appears in these Indians to be Instructed in the things of God, and to be taught to Read, in order to their coming at a fuller know∣ledge of these things, is so uncommon &amp; extraordinary, that there seems plainly to be the finger of God in it. And the Honourable Commissioners who have the disposal of the Monies, annually sent over, for the propagating the Gos∣pel among the Indians, have been so far pleased with these Accounts, that they have readily done what they thought proper, for the encouraging and supporting both Mr. <HI>Sar∣gent</HI> and Mr. <HI>Woodbridge</HI> in their respective Services.</P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="003867_0015_1002070A99BD2068"/>And as it was tho't highly proper, according to Mr. <HI>Sargent's</HI> proposal, that he should be Ordained; so His Excellency the <HI>GOVERNOUR,</HI> who is at the Head of the Commissioners, was pleased so to order the matter, as to have a very favourable Opportunity for it. For His <HI>Excellency</HI> having proposed a Treaty at <HI>Deerfield</HI> with some of the Indian Tribes, he gave orders to the Indians at <HI>Houssatonnoc</HI> to meet him there; accordingly the <HI>Governour,</HI> attended with a large Committee of the Ho∣nourable His Majesty's Council, and House of Represen∣tatives, and many other Gentlemen, was at <HI>Deerfield</HI> on <HI>August 25;</HI> And that Week being taken up in the Treaty with the Indians, in ratifying the Peace &amp; Friend∣ship between us and them; and in giving and receiving the usual Pledges of it; and Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> not coming to Town till the Friday Evening, it was judged proper to have the Ordination on the Lord's Day, which was ac∣cordingly carried on in the forenoon of the said Day, by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> and the other Ministers then present, at the desire, and in the presence of His <HI>Excellency,</HI> and the honourable Gentlemen of the General Court, and others that attended him thither, to∣gether with the Assembly of Christians usually meeting in that Place, and many of the Indians who were grave Spectators of the Solemnity, and the <HI>Houssatonnoc In∣dians,</HI> who sat by themselves, and attended throughout the whole Service with great Seriousness; and were much pleased to see One whom they had such a love for, so so∣lemnly separated to the Service of their Souls.</P>
<P>The Service was carried on in the following order, <HI>viz.</HI> the Reverend Mr. <HI>Ashley</HI> of <HI>Deerfield</HI> began with Prayer: and as by the Governour's Invitation, I waited on him in his Journey, so by His Excellency's Order I preached the Sermon, which by His authority and Influence is here made publick: The <HI>Charge</HI> was given by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield</HI>: and the <HI>Fellow∣ship of the Elders</HI> by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Springfield:</HI> and the Exercise concluded with a Song of

Praise: and the solemn Benediction of the People in the Name of the Lord, by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Sargent.</HI></P>
<P>And now; May this Servant of the Lord prove a chosen Vessel to bear Christ's Name among the Heathen, for many Years to come! May his Life and Health be precious in the sight of God! May he be filled with Wisdom and Grace from Him in whom it has pleased the Father that all fulness should dwell; and come laden to them with the Treasures of a Glorious Gospel! And may he, with his beloved <HI>Companion in the Service and Patience of Jesus Christ,</HI> be instrumental of spreading the saving knowledge of God and Christ, both far and near, among those that have for so many Ages been in ignorance! And as the Harvest shall increase, may the Lord of the Har∣vest thrust forth more and more Labourers into it! May the Funds for the support and encouragement of such be enlarged; and may all such as generously contribute to such a noble design, receive an hundred fold in this World, and in the World to come life everlasting!</P>
<P>Finally; May the <HI>SON OF GOD</HI> more fully than ever, take the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the utmost Ends of the Earth for his Possession! And may there be of every Kindred and Tongue and People &amp; Nation, shout∣ing forth the Praises of the Redeemer! Yea, may every knee on Earth as well as in Heaven, bow at the Name of Jesus, and every tongue confess, that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father!</P>

<HEAD>A Consecrated Vessel Fitted for the Master's Use.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 TIM. II. 21.</HI></BIBL>
<P>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE great Apostle of the Gentiles is giving many excellent directions, earnest exhortations, and solemn cautions and charges unto his son <HI>Timothy,</HI> in this as well as the fore∣going epistle, in order to his faith∣ful, acceptable and successful discharge of his e∣vangelical office.</P>
<P>And among other things, in some of the verses of the preceeding context, he cautions him parti∣cularly against <HI>profane and vain babblings</HI>; that is in general against all vain, empty, and impertinent discourses in the discharge of the ministerial office, &amp;c. More especially, it is a caution against his delivering any false doctrines, and spreading any errors in and by his Sermons; which instead of promoting true re∣ligion, would only serve to <HI>increase unto more ungod∣liness</HI>; and fill the world with corrupt principles, and false notions, to the destroying their virtue rather than to the promoting of it.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003867_0018_100266414DA4A918"/>And here the Apostle to back his caution, instances in two that probably were teachers in the church, viz. <HI>Hymeneus</HI> and <HI>Philetus,</HI> who had erred from the truth, and were for teaching their error to others, which was this, viz. <HI>that the resurrection was pass'd al∣ready,</HI> as at our Saviour's resurrection; or by turning all that was said concerning the resurrection into meer allegory, making it intend only our regeneration, or our being raised to newness of life; or that the resurrection is only in procreation whereby the species is continued.</P>
<P>And now such erroneous doctrines, and such false teachers, the apostle exhorts <HI>Timothy</HI> to shun &amp; avoid, if he would be a good minister of Jesus Christ. But upon it observes, That it was no great wonder, if there were some such hereticks and false teachers in the church; for it was no more than we should meet with in any great house, vessels, or utensils of different kinds, some to honour and some to dishonour; as in the verse preceeding my text: <HI>In a great house</HI> (says he) <HI>there are not only vessels of gold, and of silver, but also of wood, and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</HI> And then comes in the words of my text, <HI>If a man therefore purge himself from these</HI>; (that is from these hereticks &amp; false teachers; espe∣cially from their errors and corruptions that he spake of in the 16<HI>th</HI> &amp; 17<HI>th</HI> verses; or any other false doc∣trines and corrupt practices that would subvert the fundamental doctrines of christianity,) <HI>he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.</HI></P>
<P>Here the apostle carries on the metaphor he had begun in the foregoing verses; representing the church of God under the similitude of a great house, and Christ as the master of it; and the members, especi∣ally the ministers of the gospel, as vessels in it; which if they would be vessels unto honour, sanctified and fitted for the master's use, and prepared to every good work, must be throughly purged and cleansed.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="003867_0019_100266444AD46A48"/>It must needs be a desireable thing to be vessels unto honour, to be imployed in the high and honour∣able services of that great house, which is the church of the living God. And they are vessels unto honour indeed, who are not only sanctified, set apart and consecrated to that holy service, but are also fitted for the master's use, even prepared, qualified and dis∣posed to every good work that he shall set them about. But now in order to this, a man must be purged and cleansed: <HI>if a man purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honour, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This may suffice to introduce the scheme of my present discourse: And as for a fuller explication of the words, it shall be under the several observati∣ons which I shall be obliged to speak very briefly to.</P>
<P N="1">I. Obs. The church of God is as it were a great house, of which Christ is the head and master.</P>
<P N="2">II. Obs. Ministers are as vessels and instruments for the use and service of this house.</P>
<P N="3">III. Obs. Some of these are unto honour, and some unto dishonour.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Obs. The vessels unto honour, are such as be∣ing sanctified and set apart, are fitted for the master's use, even prepared unto every good work.</P>
<P N="5">V. Obs. In order to their being such vessels unto honour, they must be purged &amp; freed from many things.</P>
<P N="1">I. Obs. <HI>The church of God is as it were a great house, of which Christ is the head and master.</HI></P>
<P>The apostle makes a comparison between the church and a house, in the foregoing verse, and carries on the metaphor in my text, speaking of the vessels and the master of the horse. And it is not unusual for the Holy Ghost to represent the church of Christ un∣der that similitude. Sometimes the church is consi∣dered as a building it self. Thus (says the apostle to the church of Corinth) <HI>Ye are God's building,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.9. And particular saints are called lively stones, that make up the building, 1 Pet. 2 5. <HI>Ye also as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house.</HI> And so the
<PB N="4" REF="003867_0020_1002071833F1E9A0"/>
happy union of christians in the principles and prac∣tice of faith and holiness, love and charity, is repre∣sented as the several parts of a building that are fram∣ed with great exactness, so as to come together every piece to its proper place. Eph. 2.21. <HI>In whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth into an holy temple in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But then at other times the church, when it is re∣presented under the metaphor of an house, intends not the building it self, but those that live in, and belong to the house; even the family or houshold. Thus we read of the house of <HI>Cloe,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.11. of the house of <HI>Onesiphorus,</HI> 2 Tim. 1.16. which intend those that belong to the house, even the <HI>houshold.</HI> And thus the church is called the <HI>houshold</HI> of God, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.19. and the <HI>houshold</HI> of faith, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.10. So that we may indifferently consider the church of Christ either as the house it self, or as the houshold, even those that make up the family of Christ.</P>
<P>And considering the church as an house in one sense or other, Christ is the owner, head and master of it. Heb. 3.6. <HI>But Christ as a son over his own house, whose house are we,</HI> that is we christians, <HI>if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoycing of the hope firm unto the end.</HI> So that the church of Christ is his house: He is the master, the owner and the governour of it. It be∣longs to him by all imaginable right whatsoever.</P>
<P>This spiritual house, the church of God, is Christ's by gift; for it is made up of those whom the father hath given unto him, <HI>Joh.</HI> 17.2.</P>
<P>They are also his by purchase; for the church of God is what he has purchased with his own blood, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.28.</P>
<P>They are his also by conquest; for it is by his al∣mighty power and grace that they are rescued out of the hands of their spiritual enemies, bro't out of the kingdom of satan into the kingdom of the Son of God.</P>
<P>And then lastly; He is the owner &amp; master hereof by free compact and agreement; for every one that
<PB N="5" REF="003867_0021_100207324DFF38B0"/>
comes in to make a part of this spiritual house, or to be one of the houshold of faith, freely surrenders up himself to him, as to his prince and ruler, as well as saviour. They publickly own and profess him for their lord and master, and promise obedience to his commands.</P>
<P>So accordingly Christ acts as the head &amp; master of this great houshold. He looks upon them as his particu∣lar care and charge, and gives his orders, directions and commands to them, even all the laws, statutes and ordinances of the Gospel. He sets them their service, and gives every one his work to do. And then as a good housholder he makes provision for his church; not only for their bodily, but for their spiritual sup∣port and comfort. He takes care that they be fed with the bread of life. They eat and drink at his table, and are cloathed with his righteousness, as well as fed by his grace, and he takes care that every one has his portion in due season.</P>
<P N="2">II. Obs. <HI>The Ministers of the Gospel may be and are considered as vessels or instruments in this house.</HI></P>
<P>I say vessels or instruments, because the word used in my text for vessels, signifies also any instrument, as Criticks observe; especially any instruments or uten∣sils of a family, as well as those excavated ones that do more strictly go under the name of vessels.</P>
<P>The ministers of Christ are set forth under various characters, and their office represented by very diffe∣rent metaphors; some importing the honour, others the labour, and others the usefulness of their office. They are represented sometimes as <HI>angels,</HI> Rev. 1.20. sometimes as <HI>stars, Rev.</HI> 2.1. sometimes as <HI>embassadors</HI> for Christ, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.20. sometimes as <HI>messengers</HI> of the Lord of hosts. <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.7. sometimes <HI>stewards</HI> of the mysteries of God, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.1. sometimes <HI>over∣seers</HI> of the flock or family of Christ, <HI>Act.</HI> 20.28. sometimes as <HI>labourers</HI> in the harvest, <HI>Matth.</HI> 9.38. sometimes as <HI>watchmen,</HI> and at other times as <HI>servants:</HI> And in our text they are represented only as <HI>vessels</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="003867_0022_10026647AE34C7F8"/>
or <HI>utensils</HI> in the house, for the convenience and ser¦vice of the houshold.</P>
<P>And this is not the only place where ministers are represented under this humbling metaphor: For thus says the apostle, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.7. We have this treasure in <HI>earthen vessels,</HI> (that is the treasure of the gospel,) that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. And the apostle <HI>Paul</HI> might well make use of this metaphor, because the Lord himself de∣clares of him in particular, that he was a <HI>chosen vessel</HI> unto him to bear his name before the gentiles, <HI>Acts</HI> 9.15. So that ministers may be looked upon, and ought, in order to keep themselves humble, to look upon themselves but as vessels in the house: And they may well be looked upon as such; for they are but as vessels or instruments that the great master of the houshold makes use of, for the benefit of his church.</P>
<P>They are vessels as they are of God's forming and not of their own; and all formed and fashioned as he pleases; some of larger and some of smaller size and capacity, just as seems good in his sight, and will best answer the several uses they are to be put to in his church.</P>
<P>Moreover, they are vessels, as whatever is con∣tain'd in them is not their own, but what they re∣ceive: If they are filled with knowledge and wisdom, with gifts and graces, it is not from themselves any more than any empty vessel can fill itself. A vessel is capable of receiving, and that is all that can be said of us; for what have we that we did not re∣ceive? 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 4.7. All ministerial accomplishments are given to ministers: <HI>Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the father of lights,</HI> Jam 1 17.</P>
<P>Again, they are vessels as they not only are made to receive and contain, but also to pour out again, to convey and dispense to others. This is the use of vessels, not only to receive and contain, but to pour out again as there is occasion. Thus mini∣sters
<PB N="7" REF="003867_0023_100266492FE5B030"/>
have the treasures of the gospel committed to them, and are filled with gifts and graces, that they might convey &amp; dispense the same to others. Their business is to deliver as well as receive. <HI>I delivered unto you that which I received of the Lord,</HI> says the a∣postle, 1 Cor 11.23. <HI>Paul</HI> was a chosen vessel to bear Christ's name, and to convey his gospel, and the way to salvation by him to the Gentiles. And this is the business of every chosen vessel, to convey the knowledge of Christ, to dispense his gospel, and his ordinances unto the people, according as they have received them; every one according to his capacity, and the measure he has received.</P>
<P>Furthermore, ministers are vessels as they are of no use, nor are they imployed any farther than Christ, the great housholder, sees cause to make use of them. The vessels or instruments of a house can make no use of themselves, nor are they of use any further than the master of the family sees cause to occupy and improve them: so ministers are serviceable in the church no fur∣ther than Christ sees cause to improve them in his ser∣vice; and some he makes more use of, than others; and the more service he puts them to, the more honour he confers upon them.</P>
<P>Again, they are vessels as they are only the means and instruments of any real saving benefit flowing to the church by them. They are not the efficient cau∣ses, but only the instruments of the conversion of sin∣ners. They can't beget faith in any, nor bestow sav∣ing grace upon them, but are only instruments in God's hands, by which God works such a gracious change in them. <HI>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but mi∣nisters by whom ye believed?</HI> 1 Cor. 3.5</P>
<P>Lastly, Ministers are vessels as they like other vessels are liable to be broken, or in time to decay &amp; wear away. No vessel, let it be made of gold or silver, of brass or iron, and much more of wood or stone, but what <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> cusualty or other is broken to piece, or by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> usage in time wears out, so as to be fit for no <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="8" REF="003867_0024_1002071DB466B410"/>
service. And this is the case with the choicest vessels that God has among his ministers: if they are suffered to continue, yet according to the common course of nature, in a few years they wear out, dissolve to dust, and are laid aside in the place of silence and inactivity. But how much more common is it for them by some violent distemper, or some sudden stroke of the divine hand, to be dashed in pieces like a potter's vessel before that time?</P>
<P N="3">III. Obs. <HI>Among the ministers of the Gospel some are vessels unto honour, and some unto dishonour.</HI></P>
<P>As in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some to honour and some to dishonour, so it is in the church of Christ, with respect unto the ministers of it.</P>
<P>Here let me say,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Some are vessels unto honour.</HI></P>
<P>Some there are that for the exquisite frame &amp; con∣stitution of their natures, the brightness of their natu∣ral parts, their improvements by education, and above all for their refinements by divine grace, may well be compared to vessels of gold and of silver, exceeding precious and valuable, as well as useful &amp; serviceable.</P>
<P>And these vessels, these ministers are unto honour,—</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Unto the honour of Christ the master.</HI></P>
<P>Vessels of gold and silver in a house are to the ho∣nour of the master of the house, as they set forth his rich estate: so these vessels of gold and silver in the church of Christ are unto His honour, as they serve to set forth the riches and the glory of Christ. Such ministers by their doctrines and by their lives do much to display the honour of Christ: They set forth the glory of his person, the glory of his offices as our re∣deemer, the glory of his wisdom, of his power, and especially of his grace in the redemption of sinners. Hence the apostle says of such golden vessels, 2 Cor. 8.23. They are the <HI>glory of Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>They are unto the honour of the holy religion they receive, and dispense to others.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003867_0025_1002664AC3C87D98"/>A silver or a golden vessel serves to recommend the liquor or whatever is contained therein, especially if otherwise it be good in its nature and kind. And nothing tends more to do a proper bottom to religion, and recommend it to the esteem, the choice, the love and practice of a People, than its being brought to them in such golden vessels, that is, able ministers of the new testament, who are not only able by acceptable words to set forth the excellency of it, but also recommend it by their own example. Such ministers by their shining gifts and graces reflect a very plea∣sing lustre upon religion, and adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They are vessels unto honour, as they are such on whom God will confer special marks of honour.</HI></P>
<P>Vessels of gold and silver are unto honour, as the master and owner of them puts honour upon them, by taking particular care of them that they be not lost or abused, and by providing more honourable shelves and closets for them in the house. Thus God sets a great value upon those ministers that are as vessels of gold and silver; he has a higher esteem of them, and sets his love more upon them, and delights to ho∣nour them. <HI>Them that honour me I will honour,</HI> says God, 1 Sam. 2.30. He will put marks of honour upon them whilst they live, and afterwards he will crown them with glory and honour. Now he will cause them to shine like bright vessels of gold and silver, but then he will cause them to shine as the bright∣ness of the firmament, and as the stars for ever &amp; ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Among the ministers of the gospel, some are vessels unto dishonour.</HI></P>
<P>In this great house of the church there are vessels of wood and of earth; men of a course and a heavy mold, of inferior powers and small abilities, dull life∣less souls, without any vigour or activity, uncultiva∣ted and unrefined, gross &amp; ignorant in their thoughts and apprehension of things, fit only for the mean and ordinary business of life, and no way suitable for the
<PB N="10" REF="003867_0026_1002664E32BF5540"/>
high and honourable services of the sanctuary.</P>
<P>But by vessels of earth and of wood we may under∣stand men of earthly souls, men whose souls cleave unto the dust, and that mind earthly things, that are carnal, earthly and sensual, having their affections ingrossed by the world, and the things of sense, filled with some filthy lust or other, which hinders them from receiving, much more from conveying any thing that is of a sublime &amp; spiritual nature, and so utterly un∣fit for, and indisposed to the holy and spiritual servi∣ces of the sanctuary.</P>
<P>And now these are vessels unto dishonour; these are a dishonour to Christ, a dishonour to the faithful ministers of Christ, a discredit to the church and to themselves: or if they should pass without any re∣markable disgrace here, yet depend upon it, they will be covered with shame &amp; everlasting contempt here∣after.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Obs. <HI>Vessels unto honour are such as being sancti∣fied and set apart, are fited for the master's use, even pre∣pared unto every good work.</HI></P>
<P>Here is the character or account that the apostle gives of a good faithful minister, a vessel unto honour; that he is sanctified, separated and set apart to that service; and not only so, but fit for the master's use, and that is to be prepared unto every good work. So that a minister who is a vessel unto honour is,</P>
<P N="1">1. One that is sanctified, consecrated and set apart to that office.</P>
<P N="2">2. He is also one that is fit for the master's use.</P>
<P>And this</P>
<P N="3">3. Is to be prepared unto every good work.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A minister that is a vessel unto honour is one that is sanctified, consecrated or set apart for that holy office.</HI></P>
<P>A vessel unto honour <HI>sanctified.</HI>— A vessel that is unto honour must be sanctified. This doubtless has reference to the vessels of the altar and tabernacle, that were all to be sanctified before they were made use of for the service of the sanctuary, <HI>Exod.</HI> 30.29, 44.
<PB N="11" REF="003867_0027_10026650AAF72928"/>
were sanctified as they were set apart purely for that use, separate from all common &amp; ordinary uses.</P>
<P>So the Priests and Levites of old were set apart and sanctified to the holy services of the altar and taber∣nacle. And a great deal of ceremony and solemnity was used in the consecrating the priests, and separa∣ting them to their holy office. And altho' these bur∣densome ceremonies of consecration under the law are abolished; yet even now ministers of the gospel are to be sanctified, and set apart to their holy office, and in solemn manner introduced into that sacred function. They are to be <HI>separated</HI> unto the Gospel of God, as the apostle says he was, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.1. which was agrea∣ble to the direction of the Holy Ghost, <HI>Act.</HI> 13.2. <HI>Separate</HI> me Barnabas and Saul for the work where∣unto I have called them.</P>
<P>And now the manner they took for the separation of them was fasting, &amp; prayer, and laying their hands on them, as in the following verse. Accordingly this became an apostolical practice to sanctify or se∣parate to the ministerial office, by fasting &amp; prayer, and laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, accom∣panied with a solemn charge in the name of the Lord Jesus, that they take heed to their ministry, that they fulfil it. So that the solemn ordination of ministers is their sanctification or consecration or separation to the sacred office of the ministry: It is the regular intro∣duction and solemn investiture of them in their office. So that every one that is thus solemnly ordained may be said to be a vessel sanctified or consecrated.</P>
<P>But then this external sanctification supposes some∣thing that is internal and real. It signifies that God approves of them; that he sets them apart, and owns them for his ministers. And then that they separate themselves to that office, and devote and give up themselves to that service; that they separate them∣selves from the other business of life, and give them∣selves wholly to these things.</P>
<P>And now one whom the Lord approves, and does
<PB N="12" REF="003867_0028_1002072316097EA8"/>
thus sincerely give himself up to the service of Christ in the gospel ministry, and is solemnly separated by fasting and prayer, and the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, he is a vessel sanctified to all intents and purposes under the gospel.</P>
<P N="2">2 But if he would be a vessel unto honour, he must not only be sanctified; <HI>but fit or meet for the master's use.</HI></P>
<P>It is not sufficient to be sanctified and separated, unless we are fit for the use and service we are se∣parated unto. What will it signify to be ordained and inducted into that holy office of the ministry, and yet not fit for the use; not capable of answering the ends and designs of it? Therefore if such would be vessels to honour, they must be meet for the master's use. The vessels of the sanctuary that were conse∣crated, were made fit for their several uses designed for them; so must ministers be fit for the use which Christ the master has for us, if we would be vessels unto honour. The word translated <HI>fit</HI> is in <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. 4.11. Phil. 11.</NOTE> other places profitable; it signifies very profitable; it sig∣nifies that they must be very profitable for the master's use, that would be vessels of honour. They must be in all respects fit for the service of Christ. They must have that knowledge, that wisdom, and that grace that is necessary to make them fit for Christ to imploy, and to render them capable of performing the service he calls them unto. The master's use of ministers, or the business that he has occasion to use or imploy them in, is to bear his name, to make him known to the people, and the way to salvation by him, as it is laid down in the gospel. Their business is to shew men the way to Salvation; to turn men from darkness to light, and from the power of satan unto God. And now ministers must be fit for this use and business.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003867_0029_100266522DD11488"/>They must have that knowledge of God &amp; Christ, and such an acquaintance with the holy Scriptures, and with the doctrines and duties contained therein, as will make them able ministers of the new Testa∣ment. And must have that principle of love and obedience reigning in their souls, as will prompt and put them upon the faithful discharge of the trust re∣posed in them, and of answering all the good ends and purposes of their office. Without this it is im∣possible we should be fit for the master's use. For how can a man answer the end of enlightening and instructing others that is ignorant and in the dark himself? And what is there that will put a man up∣on the faithful discharge of the ministerial office, but a principle of love and obedience to Christ? But with such a principle, the man will be fit for the master's use; for such a principle reigning in the soul, will carry the man forth to every kind of service that the master shall call him to. And this leads me to say</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That they are even prepared unto every good work.</HI></P>
<P>This explains the former head; for to be fit for the master's use, is to be prepared to every good work. For what is the use the master has for his ministers? Why, it is for every good work; sometimes one good work, and sometimes another: And he that is not prepared unto every good work, is not entirely fitted for the master's use.</P>
<P>Sometimes the master has occasion to use us, in such a work, and sometimes another; and therefore the minister must be prepared for every good work. But now what a vast variety of work is there in the ministerial office, that the master does constantly, or may occasionally call us unto? There is the daily work and business of the study; giving our atten∣dance to reading, meditation and prayer, and com∣posing discourses for the publick instruction of the flock. And then there are the ministrations of God's house, such as being the mouth of the people in offer∣ing their prayers and praises to God, and bringing the
<PB N="14" REF="003867_0030_10026654AA942580"/>
oracles of God opened and applyed to them: The administration of the sacraments, and the consures of the church; visiting the sick; hearing the difficul∣ties and distresses that one and another may be la∣bouring under; clearing up their doubts, removing their ignorance, leading them out of their errors, scattering their fears, taking away their scruples, and leading them in the paths of righteousness and peace.</P>
<P>And besides these ordinary and common services of the minister, there are other services of a more difficult nature, that he may be called unto. Some∣times there are dreadful divisions and contentions to be healed. Sometimes there are gross and danger∣ous errors to be refuted, and the truths of the gospel to be supported and defended. Sometimes gross dis∣orders to be reformed, &amp; growing wickedness couragi∣ously and stedfastly to be opposed. And to men∣tion no more, sometimes they may be called, not only to bear testimony to the truth; but to seal it with their blood. These are some of the uses, that the master may have occasion to put these vessels of the sanctuary unto: And if they would be vessels unto honour, and fit for the master's use, they must be prepared for these, and every other good work.</P>
<P>Quest. But now, <HI>What is it to be prepared unto every good work?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Their being qualified and capacitated for it.</P>
<P>And then</P>
<P N="2">2. Their being constantly inclined and disposed to any and every good work, the master shall at any time set them about.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To be prepared for every good work, supposes our be∣ing qualified and accomplished for it.</HI></P>
<P>It supposes that we have those natural capacities, and those acquired accomplishments, as are in some proportion to the use and service the master calls us unto The word in the original is observed by Dr. <HI>Preston,</HI> to have a reference to the fashioning of a vessel: And therefore a man's being prepared for every good
<PB N="15" REF="003867_0031_100266572A19D500"/>
work, intends his being fashioned as a vessel, that may serve every use. It supposes such an one, in his very make, to have good natural powers and capa∣cities, and that these be inlarged, and improved and refined by education and study. To be <HI>prepared for every good work,</HI> supposes a man of superior accom∣plishments, a quick apprehension, solid judgment, and an inlarged thought, able to comprehend a great deal of knowledge, to see far &amp; wide, and reach deep into things. It supposes him also stored with a great deal of knowledge of various kinds, but especially that he be mighty in the scriptures: that he understands the doctrines of the gospel, and the arguments to support them: that he be aware of the errors crept into the church, and able to detect the false foundations up∣on which they are built: that he be well acquainted with the duties of the christian life, with the reasons and motives to inforce them: that he be apt to teach, able to convey his tho'ts and ideas of things to others, in a way that shall both enlighten their minds and affect their hearts: in a word, he must be a ready scribe, well instructed in affairs relating to the king∣dom of heaven, and furnished for every kind of ser∣vice, that the ministerial office is concerned with.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>But then this being prepared for every good work, intends that there be a constant readiness &amp; willingness to every service the master may call us unto.</HI></P>
<P>He that is prepared to every good work is not idle and slothful, he is not backward to any service that his master calls him unto. He will be diligent in his master's business, and will go on with chearfulness. He won't engage in the business he is called to by constraint, but willingly, and of a ready mind. He won't excuse himself from labour &amp; service thro' sloth and indolence, or because of the difficulty of the service; neither will he suffer himself to be so en∣cumbred with other business, as not to be able to at∣tend the work that Christ has for him to do. He will look upon himself devoted to the service of Christ,
<PB N="16" REF="003867_0032_100207298EB5EA38"/>
and will lay aside every thing that shall clog &amp; hinder him in any part of the ministerial calling.—In a word here, for I may not enlarge; He loves his master, and loves his work, and esteems his wages infinitely beyond the utmost service he can possibly do, nay and that the very service carries a reward with it; and therefore from a principle of love and gratitude, as well as that of obedience, he readily engages in every service he is set about; and rejoyces that he is counted worthy to be imployed in any service for the honour of Christ: And therefore he sticks at no work that Christ calls him to, let it be never so difficult; but if his master enquires, <HI>Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?</HI> he will (like the prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> when his lips were touched with a coal from the altar) answer, <HI>Here am I, send me,</HI> Isai. 6.8.</P>
<P N="5">V. Obs. <HI>There are certain things that ministers must be purged and cleansed from, in order to their being vessels unto honour, fitted for the master's use.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour,</HI> &amp;c. implying that there are some things cleaving naturally to them, or which they are incident unto, that must be taken away in order to their being vessels unto honour. An unclean filthy ves∣sel can't be a vessel unto honour, till it be purify'd and cleansed; and we are all such in our natural state: <HI>for who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</HI> In our state of nature we are defiled with sin, and are altogether an unclean thing; and therefore must be cleansed in order to become vessels of honour. The vessels of the sanctuary were to be clean, so were they that were to bear them, <HI>Isai.</HI> 52.11. And or∣der was expresly given concerning the Levites, that were to attend the service of the tabernacle, that they should be taken from among the children of Israel and cleansed, <HI>Numb.</HI> 8.6. And there is the same reason that all who minister in holy things, and before a holy God, should be purged &amp; cleansed from all their filthiness.</P>
<P>The prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> was so sensible of this, and of
<PB N="17" REF="003867_0033_10026658ADE8E248"/>
the danger of entering upon holy services, without be∣ing purged and cleansed, that he cries out, <HI>Wo is me for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips</HI>; and immediately there flies a Seraph with a live coal from off the altar to touch his lips, and so his iniquity was taken away, and his sin purged. And surely every one that would be meet for the master's use, must have a live coal to touch him; he must have the influences of the Holy Ghost to purge &amp; cleanse him. <HI>Isai.</HI> 6 5, 6.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>But what are the things that such must be purged from, that they might be vessels unto honour</HI> &amp;c?</P>
<P>Ans. In general, <HI>from errors in doctrines, and cor∣ruptions in heart and life.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>They must be purged from errors, and false notions in religion.</HI></P>
<P>These are particularly referred to in my text; <HI>if a man therefore purge himself from these,</HI> that is from the persons, or rather the errors of those false teachers, <HI>Hymeneus &amp; Philetus,</HI> who had imbibed, and were set∣ting forth a most dangerous doctrine, that began to spread like a gangrene, and had overthrown the faith of some. And now as ministers were to be purged from that gross error, so the reason will hold the same for their being purged from all other dangerous and destructive errors, as well as that particular one, in order to their being fitted for the master's use. Christ was full of truth, as well as grace, yea he was truth it self, and he came to teach and preach and <HI>bear wit∣ness to the truth:</HI> And it is highly necessary, that every vessel fit for his use, must receive the truth as it is in Jesus. How can that vessel be fit for Christ's use (which is to convey the truth) that is already full of error, in matters of religion, both as to the doct∣rines and duties of it? How can that man be fit to teach the truth to others, that is himself given up to strong delusions, and made to believe lies? How can that man be fit to teach others the way to salvation, that is mistaken in the way himself? I would not be understood here as if a man's having some mistaken
<PB N="18" REF="003867_0034_1002665B345435B0"/>
notions in some particular points of religion utterly un∣fits for the service of Christ; if so, I know not who would be fit for his use. For, I may venture to say, that there is not a man upon earth, but what labours under some mistakes or other; and many who have by education or prejudice imbib'd false notions in some lesser points, have been vessels unto honour. But what I refer to more especially, are fundamental er∣rors: errors in the essential parts of religion, and that are inconsistent with a principle of saving grace with∣in. And as to these, I shall not pretend to enumerate them; not that I think them so many, as the gene∣rality of people imagine.</P>
<P>But these, men must be purged from, that would engage in the service of Christ; for they disqualify persons for that sacred office. So that it highly con∣cerns every man, designing for, and engaging in this service, to take all possible care that he be found in the faith, and that his principles be well established and confirmed by the oracles of God. And he must earnestly pray that the Spirit of truth would lead him into all truth, and keep him from all errors. And if we set our selves to a diligent and impartial search after truth in the holy scriptures, we may hope to be saved from any mistake that will be hurtful unto our selves, or that will unfit us for the master's use.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>We must be purged from our lusts and corruptions, if we would be vessels unto honour.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing does so universally and effectually disqua∣lify for the service of Christ, as the prevailing of our lusts and corruptions. Accordingly this is the di∣rection to <HI>Timothy</HI> immediately after my text, that <HI>he free all youthful lusts</HI>; intimating hereby that it was absolutely necessary to his being a vessel unto honour, fit for the master's use. And so it is, for every one that would be a good minister of Jesus Christ; he must flee all manner of lusts, and get them all subdued and mortified. One lust reigning in the soul, and breaking forth in the life, pollutes &amp; dishonours the vessel, and
<PB N="19" REF="003867_0035_10020730B26CDFE0"/>
makes us unmeet for the holy service of Christ.</P>
<P>Here therefore let me say,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Such must be purged from all fleshy lusts.</HI></P>
<P>For as these war against the soul, so they war a∣gainst Christ; and how unmeet then, must they ren∣der the man for his use? The man that is under the government of fleshly lusts, is in a state of enmity and rebellion against Christ, and all that is holy. And how is such an one prepared unto every good work, when he is inclined to evil, and only evil? How can any be vessels unto honour, unless they know how (as the apostle says, 1 Thes. 4.8.) <HI>to pos∣sess their vessels in sanctification and honour?</HI> Surely if any would be vessels unto honour, they must cru∣cify the flesh with the affections and lusts, and mor∣tify their members upon the earth; fornication and all uncleanness, let it not be named among them.</P>
<P>In a word, ministers must be sober and temperate in all things, suppressing their irregular appetites, and keeping their bodies under. The apostle was so sen∣sible of the necessity of this, that he looked upon himself in hazard not only of losing the success of his ministry, but of losing himself for ever; and his words ought seriously to be considered, 1 Cor. 9.27. <HI>I keep under my body and bring it into subjection, lest that by any means when I have preached to others, I my self should be a cast-away.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Such must be purged from worldly lusts.</HI></P>
<P>That is, they must get rid of an inordinate love to the world, and the things that are in the world. For where there is such a love prevailing, there can't be that love to Christ, that is necessary for his use and service. For as our Saviour plainly tells us, Matt. 6.24. <HI>No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</HI> Whilst men's hearts are full of the world, how can they be full of Christ? Our love to Christ is necessary to our feeding his flock, and there∣fore
<PB N="20" REF="003867_0036_1002665DD59E1A78"/>
does he demand so often of <HI>Peter, Lovest thou me? Lovest thou me more than these?</HI> For as he says Mat. 10 37. <HI>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: He that loveth son or daugh∣ter more than me, is not worthy of me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Spiritual lusts must be purged away, in order to men's being vessels unto honour.</HI></P>
<P>Such as unbelief, pride, envy, malice, and the like, which are so contrary to Christ, and to the design of his gospel kingdom, that it is impossible for such, who have these lusts reigning in them, to be any way vessels of honour, meet for the master's use.</P>
<P>What can be more improper, than for one that has an evil heart of unbelief (whereby he departs from the living God continually) to be imployed in con∣veying the doctrines of the gospel to others, and be an instrument to perswade them to believe, what he does not believe himself?</P>
<P>What is more absurd than for one that has the lust of pride reigning in him, to be imployed in bringing a meek and lowly Jesus to the world, and recom∣mending the imitation of him? What more incon∣gruous, than for one that is full of hatred, malice and envy, to be imployed in representing Christ, and setting forth his infinite love &amp; good will to the world?</P>
<P>I don't say but that God may suffer such instru∣ments to be imployed, and knows how to get glory to himself by them, and so to answer his own purposes: But according to the natural tendency of things, such men are the most likely instruments the devil can have to oppose the interest of Christ, and cause a revolt over to his own kingdom. And it is most cer∣tain that such ministers as have been under the pow∣er of their lusts, have done the most of any men in the world to dishonour Christ, and hurt his interest in the world, and to overthrow the faith of christians. Which shows that ministers must be purged from these, if they would in any measure be fit for the master's use and service.</P>

<PB N="21" REF="003867_0037_1002665F6FDF3020"/>
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. Inf. <HI>Is Christ the head and master of that house, which is the church of the living God, hence his dominion and authority is to be duly acknowledged &amp; submitted to.</HI></P>
<P>He is not only head of that great family the church, but head over all things unto the church; so that he has the sole absolute government of all things in, or any way relating to his church &amp; kingdom. He has the ordering &amp; disposing of every thing in his house; he makes what provision for it he sees cause, he makes use of what vessels and instruments in the house he pleases, and as long as he pleases, and then lays them aside as seemeth good in his sight, and his sovereign hand is to be acknowledged herein. He prescribes rules &amp; orders for his house, which are carefully to be regarded by all the houshold; and these he has given us in his word, which we must carefully observe, and not presume to set up any of our own that are not a∣greable herewith. This master as <HI>Moses</HI> was faithful in his house, &amp; has given rules sufficient for his church. We must therefore carefully adhere to his institutions, without presuming to impose any inventions of our own.</P>
<P N="2">2. Inf. Are ministers but as vessels in the house, <HI>this should give them an humble sense of themselves, and keep them low in their own minds.</HI></P>
<P>Whatever high and honourable uses they are put to, they must remember they are only as vessels and instruments, not as efficient causes.</P>
<P>If they are made use of in the conversion of sinners, it is only as instruments in the hand of the Spirit; and they must take no other glory to themselves there∣in. <HI>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed? So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase.</HI> Ministers are only the vessels that bring Christ and his gospel, with all the gracious offers thereof to the soul; they can't compel or perswade men to accept there∣of; nor can they apply it to their souls and consciences.
<PB N="22" REF="003867_0038_10020736315B6BF8"/>
We only bring it to them: It is the almighty Spirit that applies whenever it becomes effectual.</P>
<P N="3">3. Inf. <HI>How should every minister be filled with fear &amp; holy jealousy, lest he ne found among the vessels unto dishonour.</HI></P>
<P>In this great house there are vessels of wood &amp; of earth, as well as of gold &amp; of silver; some unto disho∣nour, as well as some unto honour. And now every minister is one or other of these; ministers therefore should be jealous of themselves, whether they don't by their sloth and negligence, by their carnal &amp; earthly affections, give reason to fear that they are but vessels of wood and of earth. And are there not so many lusts and corruptions working in them, as may make them fear whether they are not vessels unto dishonour, and unfit for the master's use? And when we see how unprepared, how unqualified, how backward, how in∣disposed to many a good work, we are, we may well be suspicious of our selves. But oh, with what fear and trembling should this fill our souls! For such as are vessels unto dishonour, what are they but vessels of wrath? And such as are unmeet for the master's use, are fitted for destruction.</P>
<P N="4">4. Inf. <HI>Here is a rule to judge whether we are vessels unto honour or no,</HI> viz. <HI>our being fit for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Inf. <HI>How great a blessing are colleges and schools of learning, that may serve to fit men for the master's use, and prepare them for the ministerial work.</HI></P>
<P>These are the means that God makes use of to fit them for his service. Here it is, that of vessels of wood and stone, he so refines them, that he makes them vessels of gold and silver. Here it is that he in∣larges these vessels, &amp; then fills them with knowledge, by which he fits them for service. Such nurseries then are to be esteemed the great blessings of our land, and what ought always to be cherished &amp; encouraged by us.</P>
<P N="6">6. Inf. <HI>We learn what is to be looked at, in choosing and separating any to the work of the ministry, viz. their being fitted for the master's use.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="003867_0039_100207522A5EAE00"/>This is what a people are to look at in the choice of a minister; and what ministers are to look at in separating or setting apart any to that sacred office. It is the master that is to use and improve them. And unless they are fit for his use, to what purpose are they chosen and ordained to that service. The rule given to <HI>Timothy</HI> was, that <HI>he should commit this work to faithful men, who should be able to teach others also,</HI> 2 v. of the context. And therefore it would be an hor∣rible betraying of our trust, to commit this work to unskilful and unfaithful men. Accordingly that must needs be a very good rule of prudence, which the same apostle gives, 1 Tim. 5.22. <HI>Lay hands suddenly on no man</HI>; that is, not till we have some good grounds to think that they are free from gross errors and corruptions; that they are like to answer the good ends of their ministry, &amp; prove vessels unto honour.</P>
<P N="7">7. Inf. <HI>We learn what such as are entring on the mi∣nistry, must find something of in themselves, and make it their highest ambition to be obtaining more and more of continually, namely, a fitness for the master's use.</HI></P>
<P>For men to desire to be <HI>put in the priest's office for a piece of bread,</HI> meerly to get a living, without taking any care to be fit for the master's use, would be da∣ring presumption. And it is very doubtful whether such would ever come to be vessels unto honour. A man entering upon such a sacred service as this, must examine himself as to his qualifications and accom∣plishments for it. I don't mean that a man must find himself equal to the service he is engaging in; for alas! who is sufficient for these things? But every man must see some degree of fitness, before he undertakes: So much knowledge, so much grace, so much readi∣ness to Christ's service, as may give him good grounds to hope, he may answer the end of his office.</P>
<P>And now, all that remains is to apply what has been said, to the solemn occasions of this day.</P>
<P>And in the first place, I will address my self to you, dear Sir, who I trust have been applying the
<PB N="24" REF="003867_0040_1002073D97176080"/>
several things that have been offer'd, as they relate to your present case.</P>
<P>And here you see, that God is calling you, by his providence, and we trust by his Spirit, to be a vessel in his house; and you are now to be introduced, sanctified &amp; consecrated to that holy service. And we trust (or else we dare not lay our hands upon you) that you will be a vessel unto honour, and that you are in a good measure fitted for the master's use. We trust that you are free from every error that would be dangerous or hurtful to your master's inte∣rest, and from those lusts and corruptions that would pollute the vessel, and render it unfit for the service of Christ. We hope that you who are by nature un∣clean, have been so powerfully touched by the holy Ghost, as with a live coal from off the altar, that has taken away your iniquity, and purged your sin, and sanctified you throughout in spirit, soul and body. And if you find any comfortable tokens hereof, you may make an acceptable surrender of your self unto the service of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>And here I would take notice with thankfulness, that we have so much reason to hope that you are a chosen vessel, well formed and fitted by Christ to bear his name among the Gentiles, even the ignorant heathen, to whom he is now sending you; and that there is such a hopeful prospect of success among them, by the readiness there appears in so many or them to receive the glad tydings of salvation.</P>
<P>The gospel ministry has it's dangers and it's difficul∣ties in every place, but the place assigned you in the house of God has it's peculiar difficulties: and it re∣quires a vessel peculiarly formed, to be fitted for this part of the master's use. And such an one we trust you are; and rejoyce that God is inclining and spi∣riting you to that difficult service, even to go to <HI>a people of a strange speech, and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not,</HI> at present, <HI>understand.</HI></P>
<P>You are now to be a consecrated vessel in the
<PB N="25" REF="003867_0041_10026662DD784BD8"/>
house of the Lord (altho' in a dark part of it). And this imports that your office will be to convey all the treasures of a glorious gospel to the people, and to bring back the several conditions, necessities &amp; desires of the people to God. And what does this imply but that you your self must be filled with these treasures in order to your dispensing the same unto them. Oh labour then to be filled with all that speculative, spi∣ritual and experimental knowledge of God &amp; Christ that you can; and that you may be filled even with all the fulness of God. Go to the fountain head, to Christ, in whom it has pleased the father that all ful∣ness should dwell: go to him by faith and prayer, and by diligent attendance on reading, meditation and study; and he will fill you after such a manner, as that you will come to them, in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</P>
<P>And as you will be frequently pouring forth, and dispensing to the people, so frequently repair to the fountain for a supply. Remember that you are but a <HI>vessel,</HI> and so may soon be exhausted without recruits. And as you return to God to be replenished, don't forget to come laden with the wants and desires of your poor people. Remember to pour out your prayers to God for them, as you pour out or dispense the grace of God to them. And thus endeavour to be full going and coming. And by being thus con∣tinually imployed in carrying what Christ the master has to send to the people, and bringing back requests with thanksgivings upon their account, you will be found a vessel unto praise and honour and glory.</P>
<P>For altho' the use that the master puts you to in his house, may appear mean and contemptible to the men of the world, who have their hearts set upon the gaiety and granduer of it, and can think of no∣thing but ease and pleasure; and altho' but few of those who are consecrated vessels in the house of the Lord, will submit unto it; yet it is a most glorious service in the eyes of Christ the master, &amp; of all the
<PB N="26" REF="003867_0042_100266655B34FB28"/>
angels in heaven, that are beholding your solemn consecration: for those ministring spirits think it their honour to be sent, and do with pleasure go forth to minister unto them who shall be the heirs of salvation. And oh what an honour, what a plea∣sure must it needs be to every one that has a love to Christ and a compassion for souls, to turn men from darkness to light, and from the power of satan unto God; to convert them from the error of their ways, and to save their souls from death!</P>
<P>Wherefore, to carry on the metaphor, don't be ashamed of the outward meanness of the apartment the master has assigned you in his house; and don't be discouraged at the difficulties you may have the prospect of; but let those gracious words of Christ, LO I AM WITH YOU ALWAYS, be a comfort to you: and the tokens you have had already of Christ's presence with you, in the success of your labours hitherto, may well encourage your further dependance upon him. Go forth therefore in the name &amp; strength of the Lord Jesus, &amp; we trust that he will never leave nor forsake you, and that his grace shall be sufficient for you. And let me assure you, that if you be wise and faithful in this work, you shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of your father; and when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive an unfading crown of glory.</P>
<P>And now I would turn my self to the <HI>Houssatonnoc</HI> Indians, who are at this time to have a minister sent unto them.</P>
<P>Behold the man, the messenger of the Lord of hosts, that is coming unto you. This is a vessel God has made choice of, to bring Christ, and in him the glad tydings of salvation to you. This is the man that is to shew you the way to salvation; to direct you how you may escape the damnation of hell; and how you may obtain the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. See then that you love him, and that you steem him very highly in love for his works sake;
<PB N="27" REF="003867_0043_10020745EC528308"/>
and that you come to him to be instructed by him: that you hearken to his counsels, and observe his di∣rections, and follow his example wherein he follows Christ. And this is the way for you to be happy here, and for ever hereafter; for godliness hath the promise of the life that now is, &amp; of that which is to come.</P>
<P>To conclude, How earnestly should we all pray, that there might be numbers of chosen vessels, persons fitted and disposed to carry the everlasting gospel to the heathen nations that are about us: to convey to them the knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ, whom to know is life eternal. How should we pity them when we see them perishing for lack of vision? And how should we be doing our utmost to encourage per∣sons to go forth and carry the gospel to them? And how highly proper would it be for the Government to take effectual care to support and encourage such as God may raise up from time to time, to go forth into such difficult service? And since many of our nation at home have expressed such a tender concern for the propagating the gospel among the Indian natives of this Land, at so great a distance from them, by their charitable and pious donations for that purpose, it must needs be highly reasonable that we who live among them, and possess their country, should readily expend of our estates, for that which will be of the greatest ad∣vantage to them. This is a way of honouring the Lord with our substance, which doubtless God expects from us.</P>
<P>But to have done, Let us be careful to recommend christianity to them, by our own sincere practice of it. Let us make it manifest to them, in all our trea∣ties, and in all our commerce, and conversation with them, that we are under the influences of the Spirit of Christ. In a word, let us adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things, &amp; cause our lights so to shine before them, that they seeing our good works, may be moved also to glorify our father which is in heaven.</P>

<HEAD>As an Introduction to the Ordination, the Reverend Mr. <HI>William Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> Moderator, thus apply'd himself to His Excellency the GOVERNOUR, being present.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T having pleased the most wise &amp; gracious GOD, who governs all things, to put it into the Hearts of a number of generous and well disposed Persons in <HI>Great Bri∣tain,</HI> to devote a part of their Estate to promote the propagation of the knowledge of Christ, the only Saviour of a perishing World, among the Natives of <HI>America,</HI> who for an unknown number of Generations, have been ignorant of Him, and been perishing thro' lack of vision: And this their Charity being under the direction of an honourable Corporati∣on there, and a number of the Honourable and Re∣verend Gentlemen here, of which Your Excellency is at the Head, being appointed as Commissioners by them to direct and put forward that good Work; who now being satisfied, after a considerable time of trial, of a good Disposition in the Indians at <HI>Houssa∣tonnoc</HI> and parts adjacent, to be instructed: And having obtained a fit Person for that great and diffi∣cult but worthy Service; and there being now a num∣ber of Pastors convened to set him a part by solemn Ordination to that Service; we humbly ask, if it be Your Excellency's Pleasure, that we now proceed to it; and that a just and proper care should be taken for his encouragement in it</P>
<P>To which His Excellency the Governour manifested His Approbation.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="003867_0045_1002666956149A68"/>It was then ask'd of the Person to be Ordained;</P>
<P>You now understand, <HI>Sir,</HI> That it is His Excel∣lency's desire, in the Name of the Honourable and Reverend the Commissioners for the Propagation of the Gospel among the Natives of <HI>New-England</HI>; That you would take upon you, that Ministry and Service.</P>
<P>I now ask you, whether you are willing to conse∣crate your self and service to Christ, and to the good of the Souls of those poor People to whom you are sent; who have hitherto sat in darkness and in the shadow of Death; to take a Pastoral care of them, and to spend your time in a careful Instructing of them in Christian Knowledge.</P>
<P>To which Mr. <HI>Sargent,</HI> the Person deputed, gave his Consent.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="form of ordination">
<HEAD>Now follows the form used in his Ordination.</HEAD>
<P>WE do now in the Name of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and by virtue of the authority derived from Him, set apart and Ordain you a Minister of CHRIST, to serve in the Affairs of his Kingdom, under the conduct and direction if his Providence; and especi∣ally to take a Pastoral Care of the Natives inhabiting at <HI>Houssatonnoc,</HI> and as many as will join themselves with them and submit to your Instruction. And to you are now committed the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, that what you bind on Earth should be bound in Heaven, and what you loose on Earth should be loosed in Heaven. In this Service it must be your care to be prudent, faith∣ful and diligent. You should remember that your Service is both honourable and difficult: It is honourable as be∣ing a Service for the great GOD, whose <HI>Name alone is excellent in all the Earth;</HI> and immediately a Service to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, for the spreading of his Glory, Name, and Kingdom in the World; whom the Father will have all Men to honour even as they honour Himself; who hath put the highest honour upon him in
<PB N="30" REF="003867_0046_1002074BB428E7C0"/>
raising him from the dead, and giving him Glory, even that Glory which he had with him before the World was, and hath put this peculiar honour upon him as Mediator, in giving all power in Heaven and Earth to Him. We read that the greatest Person that had been born of a Wo∣man thought himself not worthy to hear his Shoes after him: And the holy Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> thus expresses himself, <HI>To me is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.</HI> To preach CHRIST, &amp; the great Salvation he has wro't out for a sinful World, tho' at present far less profitable, yet is not less honourable than any Service that Men are imployed in in this World; and they who obtain mercy of the Lord to be faithful in it, and are instrumental to turn many to Righteousness, <HI>shall shine as the Stars for ever &amp; ever.</HI></P>
<P>But GOD puts this special honour upon you ministeri∣ally and declaratively, to lay a foundation of Christian Knowledge, by preaching CHRIST, and teaching the fundamental Truths of the Gospel among those to whom they have not hitherto been made known. This was what the great Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> was ambitious of, to Preach the Gospel, not where Christ was named, lest he should build on another man's foundation.</P>
<P>Now this being your special Province, I may mind you that it concerns you to use all that wisdom and heavenly art you have, to lay a good Foundation, even to build on the Foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, making JESUS CHRIST the chief corner Stone. And tho' I am not ignorant that it is hard and difficult exactly to de∣termine what are &amp; what are not Fundamentals in Reli∣gion, yet I shall venture to mention some things which you must teach that are the main Pillars which support the Christian Building.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> Matters to be believed by us, which are plainly taught in the holy Scriptures, or by just and necessary con∣sequence inferred from them, to which you must not add, nor diminish from, nor shun to declare the whole counsel of GOD.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="31" REF="003867_0047_1002666CC13163B0"/><HI>2.</HI> The Worship or Service of GOD, which is the visi∣ble respect he requires his People to pay to Him: This is both natural and instituted: It must be all and only that which He has appointed. Your special duty as to this lies in Praying with and for those that are commit∣ted to your Charge. You must not sin against the LORD in ceasing to Pray for them. In Preaching the Word both in season and out of season: and in your Preach∣ing you must be careful to Preach the Truths plainly, sea∣sonably, and convincingly, so as to reach their Under∣standings, Consciences and Affections: You must admi∣nister the Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord's Supper to Persons duly qualified: Baptism to visible Believers and their Seed, the Lord's Supper to such as can examine themselves and discern the Lord's Body, and who are of a regular Conversation. You must apply the Censures to such as are scandalous or heretical to bring them to Re∣pentance; doing all things without partiality, for <HI>he that acquitteth the Wicked, and he that condemns the Just, are both of them an abomination to the Lord.</HI> You are also authoritatively to bless in the name of the LORD.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> The spiritual benefits of Justification, Grace, Peace, and Salvation, that flow alone from CHRIST as the Head of his mystical Body, and the grand Medium of all Divine Communication to us, are to be explained to them.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> Such Christian Duties as are to be done and practi∣sed by all who profess themselves the Disciples of CHRIST, that they may he kept in a state of Grace and Salvation, may honour their relation to CHRIST, and adorn the Profession they make. These are too many now to be enu∣merated. And it will be a special part of your Business to teach them the good Way and right Way in which they must walk. If you do these things faithfully, you will be a Workman that need not to be ashamed; you will ho∣nour your great Lord and Master, will honour your self: And <HI>when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="003867_0048_100207508ADA9468"/>I may mind you now, that there are Difficulties which attend this honourable Service, which must be ex∣pected and provided against, besides what are common to you with other Ministers of CHRIST; there are peculiar Difficulties, many of which you may foresee, and possibly many more than you can foresee, from the Place &amp; Per∣sons to whom you are sent; to an ignorant People, to a People of a strange Speech and an hard Language, whose Words you cannot understand; to an uncultivated People, among whom you must take leave of many of the Conve∣niencies and Comforts of Life, which are enjoyed in the civilized World: It will require much labour and incul∣cation to instill into them the necessary Truths of Divine Knowledge, which they are yet ignorant of; they must be taught <HI>Line upon Line, and Precept upon Precept,</HI> even as Children <HI>weaned from the Milk and drawn from the Breast.</HI> Besides, there's danger lest they be tenacious of Customs, they have received by Tradition from their Fathers; inconsistent with the Faith &amp; Wor∣ship of the Gospel, which they will not easily be brought to renounce. They have also as others have had, their National and Hereditary Vices, which by long custom they have been habituated to, &amp; have been hitherto uncon∣vinced of the evil of, which seems as hard to recover them from, as <HI>for the Ethiopian to change his skin, or the Leopard his spots.</HI> These things will necessary put you upon much Assiduity, Watchfulness, and Prayer, that you may be furnished with the armour of Righteous∣ness on the right hand and on the left, with knowledge, Prudence, Patience, Meekness, Humility, Self-denial, and Zeal for the Honour of Christ, and the good of Souls; especially that you may enjoy the promised Presence of Christ always with you, to Guide, Strengthen, and Com∣fort you in the Work he now calls you to; to whose Grace we now commend you.</P>

<HEAD>After the CHARGE, with the Imposition of Hands, the Reverend Mr. STEPHEN WILLIAMS of <HI>Long Meadow</HI> in <HI>Springfield,</HI> Taking Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> by the Right Hand, thus address'd him,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend, and Dear Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><Q>WE heartily rejoyce, that <HI>the God of all Grace,</HI> has so well fitted and qualify'd you for, and dispos'd and inclined you, to undertake this great and <HI>glorious</HI> Work, of carrying the Gos∣pel to the <HI>Heathen</HI>; and that he has disposed and inclined such a number of them to receive the Gos∣pel of our Lord Jesus Christ. And I do now testify, and declare to you, in the Name of the <HI>Ministers</HI> here present, that we look upon you, as a Minister of Jesus Christ, duly called, and in∣troduced into the Work of the <HI>Evangelical</HI> Mini∣stry, and that you may be assured of our Prayers always, and of our help and assistance (as far as we are able) in the great, good, as well as difficult, and self-denying Service, you have so willingly engag'd in. We heartily desire and pray, you may be instrumental of <HI>turning many to Righteous∣ness,</HI> that so you may <HI>shine as the Stars for ever and ever,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>And then he turn'd himself to the <HI>Houssatonnoc</HI> Indians (who sat in a body by themselves) and said, <Q>Now <HI>my Brethren and Friends</HI> of the <HI>Hous∣satonnoc</HI> Indians, You have seen the Reverend Mr. <HI>Sargent</HI> solemnly <HI>set apart</HI> to the Work of the Ministry: I ask of you, whether you willingly re∣ceive him, as your Teacher, and Instructor, in Spiritual and Divine Things? If you do, I desire you would signify it, by standing up? Upon which, they all rose up, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>N. B</HI> That what was said to the Indians as above, was interpreted to them Sentence by Sentence, that so they might all understand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
