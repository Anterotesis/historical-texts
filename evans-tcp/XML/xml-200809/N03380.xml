<HEAD>THE PREFACE</HEAD>
<P>IT may possibly be deemed by some, a very unaccountable Procedure for such a Junior, in this Publick Manner, to trou∣ble the World with any of my Performan∣ces. I confess, the Consideration of my Youth (upon which account, that may be looked upon as Arrogance in Me, which wou'd be well accepted of in another, whose Time and Experience in the World had given him a greater Liberty) has been the greatest Stumbling Block to my self in the Way of this Publication. But I think it ought to be remembred, that where Recommending Age is wanting, the Use∣fulness and Importance of the Subject offer'd to the Publick, is a sufficient Pass∣port, and may pass for a tolerable <HI>Impri∣mature</HI>: Likewise, my Publick and Sacred Character, as a Minister of the Gospel of Christ, may allow me, at least, the Liberty
<PB N="ii" REF="004117_0003_1003CDD379ADD2C8"/>
of being as extensively Useful as I can, of pursuing such Methods as have a Ra∣tional Tendency to promote Mens Spiri∣tual Interest.</P>
<P>But I presume, a true Account of the Reasons of the Publication, and my Prin∣cipal Design in it, will be its best Vindi∣cation. It is not only designed for the benefit of such as I have no other Way of access to, and are destitute of better Helps for their Instruction in these great Truths of the Gospel, but cheifly for the Benefit of such as are my ordinary Hearers: and sure, any Minister may endea∣vour the good of those he is related to in that Capacity, in any Method conducive thereto, without a Criminal Imputation.</P>
<P>The Discourses here presented to your View, as the Title-page informs you, are Sermons which I had before preached at <HI>Middletown,</HI> a part of my present charge; After I had preached them, considering the great Weight and Importance of the Doctrines contained in them, the Advan∣tage and Necessity of being acquainted with
<PB N="v" REF="004117_0004_1003CDD98DDD8B98"/>
several Discourses through, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Regularly, in their order; for they giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mutual Light to each other; and perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that which appears more dark to your Un∣derstanding, or difficult to your Faith in one place, may open up to your fuller Sa∣tisfaction in another; at least, it is likely you will be better disposed to yield your assent to the Doctrines here advanced, after you have carefully perused the whole, and so have them under your View at one prospect, with their Dependance upon and Connexion with one another. Divine Truths indeed frequently address them∣selves to the Human Understanding under a very great Disadvantage, because it is often bribed and byassed, either by Educa∣tion or a perverse Will; whence it is that disengenuous Minds immediately set them∣selves to believe that to be false, which they would unwillingly have to be True: but Truth will be Truth whether we will or not; and therefore it is necessary that the Reader lay aside all such Corrupt Byasses, and bring with him a Judgment ingenuously disposed to yield to sufficient Evidence.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this Epistolary Address
<PB N="vi" REF="004117_0005_1003B24B452D16A8"/>
without offering a few Words to such slothful and secure Persons as make no Conscience of attending upon God in his Publick Worship; as seldom, or never come to hear the Gospel of Christ Prea∣ched.</P>
<P><HI>Very Dear and Immo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al Souls,</HI> you will not give me any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> opportunity of deal∣ing with you for your Good and Happi∣ness: If it shall please the Lord, in the course of his Providence, to cast these Lines under the Eye of any of you, with the tenderest Regard to your Souls Happi∣ness, I pray you to consider what a foolish and mad part you act, in being so careless and unconcerned about your Eternal State. You have so little concern about it in your Hearts, that you will not so much as be at the pains to come and hear the Solemn Truths of GOD declared to you, and so slight and contemn all the Messages of Heaven: Oh, <HI>Sirs</HI>! how will you stand confounded, and filled with the deepest Horrors in the great Day, when you come to give an Account of the Pains you have been ai to serve the Lord, and save your

own Souls! How know you but something has been spoken, at such times when you had opportunity of being present, which the Lord might have blessed to your Conversion and Eternal Happiness, had you been there, and then happy should you be indeed; but alas! by your Wicked Neglect, you are like to be your own Eter∣nal Ruin. All the plausible Excuses with which you endeavour to blind your stupid Consciences, are nothing but disguised Shifts: You'll say, it's like, <HI>You can serve the Lord as well at home and do as much for the good of your Souls as if you went to hear the Word:</HI> But do you spend the Day in the Service of the Lord at Home? do you spend the Sabbath in a Religious and holy Manner? I appeal to your own Breasts, if it it is not otherwise: I call upon your Consciences to witness against you. You'll, perhaps, read a few Chap∣ters of the <HI>Bible</HI> in a formal careless man∣ner, and perhaps a part of some other Book, and this is all you do for the most part that looks like Religion; The rest of the Lord's Day you spend, some part of it in sleeping and lolling upon your Beds, much
<PB N="viii" REF="004117_0007_1003CDEE6769E7A0"/>
of it sometimes in going abroad and visiting your Neighbours to pass the time away in Worldly and unprofitable Discourse, which suits your Earthly Minds; many of you spend it in Idle Recreations and Diversions. Are not these the ways in which you serve the Lord at Home? O <HI>Sirs!</HI> What will be the issue of such a Heaven daring Course of Life! But supposing you did spend the Sabbath in a Religious Manner, in the exercise of private and secret Duties, yet this would not excuse the Neglect of the Publick Worship: Every thing is beau∣tiful in its Season; and God never de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igned one Order of Duties to turn out another, All his Institutions are consistent together, and to be attended upon: God, who has appointed a Gospel-Ministry, and Ordinances to be dispensed in his Church, certainly requires Mankind to attend upon them. And sure you cannot plead my peculiar Dispensation or Liberty for the Neglect of them more than others. If others who have as much Liberty this way as you can Pretend to, should act as you do, the Institutions which God has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dered to be continued to the End of the
<PB N="ix" REF="004117_0008_1003CDF2ADE5BD98"/>
World (<HI>Matt.</HI> 28.19.20.) should soon come to an End.</P>
<P>And now let me entreat you to consider what Rebellion you are guilty of against GOD, how you contemn his Authority, act to the Dishonour of JESUS Christ, and slight the great Means which he has appointed for your Salvation; and do no more so wickedly: And if you have so little regard for your precious perishing Souls, as that you will not put your selves to the trouble of coming to the House of God to hear his Word, I affectionately be∣seech you conscientiously to peruse these Discourses which I now endeavour to send to your own Houses, and seek after true Conversion to Christ and eternal Happiness with him. <HI>May the blessing of the high GOD accompany these poor Labours to the Honour of his holy Name, and the saving good of Men.</HI> So desires, so prays, Cour∣teous Reader,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Very dear Brethren;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS it was from a sincere desire of your Souls Good and Happiness, that I first delivered these Discourses to you from the Pulpit, so, it is for the same End that I now send them to you from the Press. It was with a View to your Benefit in particular that I was principally induced to make them Publick to the World; that, having them by you in your Houses, you might have the greatest Advantage possible of obtaining saving Instruc∣tion by them. I desire you, not only to read them, but consider what you read, that your Hearts may be suitably affected with the Truths of GOD. I beseech you to try the State of your own Souls by them, and consi∣der what Condition you are in. The Lord knows it is the earnest desire of my Heart that you might all be united to JESUS Christ. It would be among my greatest comforts, if you did but unfeignedly give up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Hearts to the Redeem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and embrace

<P>TH<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Words are a part of that famous Discourse which our <HI>Lord Christ</HI> enter∣tain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>codemus</HI> with, a noted Ruler of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Jews,</HI> who came privately to <HI>Jesus</HI> by Night, not cra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tily, like the rest of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> but with a Pious design of having some instructive Conversation with him. In which to vers. 13. the <HI>Lord</HI> opens the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ture, and declares the necessity of the new Birth, in order to salvation. From the Thirteenth to the Nine∣teenth verse, he preaches to him the great Fun∣damen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Doctrines of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> the last, and clearest Revelation of God's will to Mankind concerning their Salvation.

And as the Israelites were not healed, only, by <HI>Moses</HI> lifting up the Serpent, but by their locking upon it: So Christ informs <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> that in order to partake of the Ver∣tue and benefit of his Death, Sinners must have an Eye of Faith fixed upon him for it. This necessity of Faith in him, in order to Justification and Salvation by him, the Lord clearly insinu∣ates thro' the whole context. And in this 18. <HI>v.</HI> He expresly urges it from two Considerations, <HI>viz.</HI> The Advantage that attends it, the great Benefit that accrues to the believer by it, and, upon the other Hand, the Disadvantage of the want of it. The first Consideration he expres∣ses in these Words, <HI>He that believeth on him</HI> (i. e. on the Son of God,) spoken of <HI>v.</HI> 17. who was himself that was then speaking) <HI>is not condemned,</HI> i. e. he is delivered from Condemnation, which before he was under; Brought out of a State of Condemnation into a State of Justification.

Christ</HI> says not, he will be condemned, or he is like to be condemned; but, he is condemned already. By sin he has laid himself under condemnation, and by Unbeleif resists the last and only Re∣medy for 'his Recovery; And so is still in his condemned estate, every Moment, until he comes to <HI>Christ</HI> by Faith. This, O! this is the present Condition of every unconverted Person, of every Soul, until he closes with <HI>Christ</HI> by Faith for Relief.</P>
<P>The sense and meaning of our <HI>Lord</HI> in this Verse is to this purpose: as if he had said to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> You have acknowledged me to be a Teacher come from GOD; I am indeed the Son of God, and promised <HI>Messiah,</HI> and so the greatest Prophet, I open, and clearly reveal the <HI>Gospel,</HI> the Way in which God will have Sinners to be saved. Now, this is the Language of the <HI>Gospel, He that believes in me,</HI> as his only and All-sufficient Saviour, unfeignedly, and heartily receiving me as such, shall be delivered from the Guilt of all his Sins, and brought into a state of Justification and Peace with God; but he that does not so believe in me comply's not with the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and refuses his only Reme∣dy;

The state of every Man and Woman is positively decided and determined in Gods Word, in one or other of these two, Sayings, <HI>Whosoever believeth on the Son of God, is Not Condemned; but whosoever believeth Not on the Son of God, is Condemned already.</HI></P>
<P>Now, tho' (as I hinted before) there is a similitude between a Persons being in a state of Condemnation before God in this Life, and a Person's being condemned by a human Law, before his Trial, or Judicial Sentence from the Judge; yet there is this great Dissimilitude; a Person, in the latter Case, may from the secrecy

of his Transgression, or upon many other accounts, hope that he shall never be brought to Trial, or, that the Crime can't be proved against him, and so, having to do with finite Crea∣ture, like himself, that he shall escape the Execution of the Law; but none of these relieving Apprehensions can have any Place here. We have to do with an infinitely just God, who will see to the Execution of his <HI>Law,</HI> upon those that are held under Condemnation by it. A God of eternal Truth, who will do all that he has spoken; an Omniscient and All-knowing <HI>Jehovah,</HI> who sees the most concealed Actions and bosom Thoughts, and registers all the Sinners iniquities in the <HI>Book</HI> of his infallible Remembrance. So that he may truly say with <HI>Job, Chap</HI> 14.16, <HI>Thou numbrest my steps, dost thou not watch over my Sins? My Transgression is sealed up in a Bag, and thou sewest up mine Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Sum of what I have spoken upon this Head is, that a State of Condemnation, which all Unbelievers are in, is such as God, by that Method which he has constituted and esta∣blished to prosecute Sin in, adjudges to the Pu∣nishment of <HI>Hell</HI> for ever, which Punishment, the condemned Person (continuing in that State) can by no means escape, as the guilty some∣times may before a human Bar.</P>

<P>And then 3<HI>dly,</HI> consider, That all Mankind have broken God's Law, and so actually laid themselves under the Condemning Sentence of its Penal Sanction. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.19, 23.</P>
<P>Now from these Things it appears, that all Unbelievers, having no actual Interest in the Satisfaction made by Christ, for the Redempti∣on of fallen guilty Sinners, are still in their state of Condemnation, and that that State is such, wherein they are bound over to the Punishment of <HI>Hell,</HI> every Moment they continue such. And is not this an awful case, Brethren!

<P N="2">2.

<PB N="11" REF="004117_0021_1003CE53592DCD00"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom this Guilt, through the Imputation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Christs Righteousness, which the Apostle observes, is more efficacious to the Justification of those to whom it is applied, than <HI>Adam</HI>'s sin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to their Condemnation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. <HI>v.</HI> 15, 16, 17. But Unbelievers, having no Interest in the Righteousness of Christ, are still under Con∣demnation by it. This Doctrine of the Impu∣tation of the Guilt of <HI>Adam</HI>'s sin, is a Truth very clearly maintained in the holy Scriptures, how much so ever it is dis-relished by many in our Day, who are unwilling to submit to such a humbling Consideration. Through a great part of the 5th Chapter to the <HI>Romans,</HI> the in∣spired Apostle very evidently maintains it. <HI>Vers.</HI> 12. he tells us, <HI>That by One Man sin entred into the World, and Death by sin; and so Death passed upon all Men; for that all have sinned.</HI> The meaning of which Passage, I think, is plainly this, That by the Transgression of our Pro∣genitor <HI>Adam,</HI> Sin was imputed to the whole World of his Posterity; by which Imputation of Sin and Guilt, as they became subject to all other Miseries, so particularly to Death; and hence it is, that all men Dye, because they are looked upon as Sinners, by virtue of that Transgression. The Reason which the Apostle assigns why Persons Dye, is because they have sinned; but Experience abundantly witnesses, that many dye before they come to a capacity of sinning actually, and therefore he must mean Sinners by Imputation, and not by actual
<PB N="12" REF="004117_0022_1003CDBCA72FDC40"/>
Imitation. To the same purpose he tells us, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.22. <HI>That in</HI> Adam <HI>all Dye.</HI> And in the 18. <HI>vers.</HI> He expresses it very fully, <HI>by the Offence of One, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemnation.</HI> And again, <HI>v.</HI> 19. He makes a plain comparison between the <HI>Disobedience</HI> of <HI>Adam</HI> and the <HI>Obedience</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> in their contrary Effects, <HI>As by one Mans Disobedience many were made Sinners: So by the Obedience of One, shall many be made Righteous.</HI> Whence it is evident that as we are made Righ∣teous in Christ, by the Imputation of his Righteousness and Obedience to us, so we were made Sinners in <HI>Adam,</HI> by the imputation of his Disobedience and Transgression. And from this similitude between <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> it is that <HI>Apostle. v.</HI> 14. calls <HI>Adam</HI> the Figure or Type of him that was to come, that is, of <HI>Christ JESƲS.</HI> Very full to this purpose also is that of the <HI>Apostle, Ephes.</HI> 2. <HI>v.</HI> 3 <HI>We were by Nature, the Children of Wrath, even as others.</HI> In this <HI>Verse</HI> the <HI>Apostle</HI> relates the deplorable Condition that all the Godly themselves were in, before their Conversion, which he observes to be the Condition of all the Unconverted World; And <HI>first,</HI> He takes notice of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir Disposition towards <HI>God,</HI> Qualitatively, that they were averse to <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>Laws,</HI> follow∣ing very contrary Lusts; and then he takes notice of their state towards <HI>God,</HI> relatively, in this last Claûse, He does not say, <HI>Children of Disobedience,</HI> signifying their Inherent Na∣tural
<PB N="13" REF="004117_0023_1003CE6216099DE8"/>
propensity to Evil; That he had spoken of in the first Part of the <HI>Verse</HI>; But, <HI>Children of Wrath,</HI> signifying their State of Condemna∣tion before <HI>God,</HI> and such, he says, they were, by Nature, <HI>i. e.</HI> they came into this Con∣demned Slate, and were subject to the Wrath of <HI>God,</HI> so soon as they received the Human Nature.</P>
<P>Thus you see, this Doctrine of Original Guilt is no Human Invention, but is learned from the Oracles of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I would further add, That the Imputa∣tion of <HI>Adams</HI> Sin to his Posterity is evident from the Effects of it upon them; of which these two are obvious, to every one, <HI>viz.</HI> Na∣tural Death, and the moral Corruption of Human Nature. <HI>By Sin Death entered into the World,</HI> says the <HI>Apostle.</HI> The World had been a stranger to Death had it not been for sin; and therefore, we find it entailed upon Man after the Fall, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3, 19. <HI>Dust thou art, and unto Dust shalt thou Return.</HI> The Reason why Death pas∣ses upon all, is <HI>because all have sinned, Rom</HI> 5, 12. and we see Death, with a numerous train of painful Diseases, passes upon multitudes that have never sinned actually, or, (as the <HI>Apostle</HI> phrases it, <HI>v.</HI> 15.) <HI>after the similitude of Adams Transgression</HI>; and therefore, it must be because of their concern in his Transgression.</P>
<P>No less certainly is our Original Depravity a Judicial Effect of the Sin of our first Parent. That Mankind universally are averse to Holiness, and prone to Sin by nature, is
<PB N="14" REF="004117_0024_1003CE6A9F8F8378"/>
evident to every Eye that is not stone blind. So soon as they set out upon the Stage of Action, so soon they begin to go away from <HI>God.</HI> They have not a knowledge of Divine Spiritual Things sufficient to determine their Wills to moral Goodness, and light them in the Ways of <HI>God.</HI> And if in any Instance it is otherwise, it is owing to the supernatural Renewing Grace of <HI>God,</HI> who can infuse the Principles of Sanctification and the New Nature as soon as he pleases. In short, it is obvious, that Man∣kind come into the World altogether unfur∣nished and unfit to attain the great End of their being, <HI>viz.</HI> the active Glorifying of <HI>GOD,</HI> and are bent the Backward way. To this pur∣pose <HI>David</HI> says, <HI>Ps.</HI> 51, <HI>v,</HI> 5. <HI>I was sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</HI> And <HI>Christ</HI> says, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3, 6. <HI>That which is born of the Flesh is Flesh.</HI> That is, sinful and cor∣rupt, opposed to Spiritual, in the next clause. But certainly Man was not at first created thus sinful and depraved, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1. <HI>v.</HI> 27. <HI>GOD created Man in his own Image,</HI> which Image, the <HI>Apostle</HI> informs us, consists in <HI>Knowledge Col.</HI> 3, <HI>v.</HI> 10. <HI>And Righteoussness, and true Holiness, Ephes.</HI> 4. <HI>v.</HI> 24. <HI>Eccl.</HI> 7. <HI>v.</HI> 29. <HI>GOD made Man upright.</HI> The Wisdom and Goodness of God appears thro' the whole Creation, in fitting every Thing for the attaining of its End. And indeed every wise Agent, does so with his Work. It is evident, from the Natural En∣dowments of Man, that he was made for the
<PB N="15" REF="004117_0025_1003CE71E3BC1A10"/>
Active Glorifying of <HI>GOD</HI> for yielding a Rational Service to his Maker; and enjoying a rational Happiness in Him the Fountain of all Felicity. How comes it then that he now ap∣pears altogether so unfit for the pursuit of this noble End? shall we impeach the Divine Wis∣dom and Goodness in this Case? Of this no other Satisfactory Reason can be given, but the Interest which all Mankind have in the first Transgression; upon this Account <HI>God,</HI> in a Judicial Way, <HI>creates</HI> them destitute of the Principles and Powers of true Holiness.</P>
<P>What degrees of Punishment Mankind are condemned to, barely upon the Account of the Transgression of our first Parents, I neither do nor can determine; But this is certain, that thereby we lost all Claim and Title to the happy Enjoyment of <HI>God,</HI> were condemned to eternal Exile from his comfortable and glorious Presence, and are, naturally, divested and de∣stitute of his beautiful moral Image, having a darken'd Understanding and perverse Will; averse to Holiness, and proneness to Evil encli∣ning, and leading to all manner of Sin against the very dictates of Reason and Conscience; by which Actual Transgression the Soul is ex∣posed to an aggravated and inconceivably dreadful Damnation. Thus, by the Fall we are plunged in a Deluge of Misery and Wo, fallen into a course of Actual Rebellion against <HI>GOD,</HI> and thereby exposed to the just and <HI>Awful</HI> Revenge of his offended Majesty for
<PB N="16" REF="004117_0026_1003CE7596D44CA0"/>
ever; so that we stood in the most absolute need of a Redeemer.</P>
<P>Let none here be so brutishly ignorant, as to say, <HI>How can we be the Worse for</HI> Adam's <HI>Transgression, at this Distance of Time? A Transi∣ent Act that was committed almost Six Thousand Years ago?</HI> Consider, that one Day is with the <HI>Lord</HI> as a Thousand Years, and a Thousand Years as one Day, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3 <HI>v.</HI> 8. See <HI>Ps.</HI> 90. <HI>v</HI> 4. If GOD at first, in his unsearchable Wisdom determined this Method to proceed with Mankind in, to find them Guilty upon the Transgression of their first Parent, what mean Conceptions must such have of the di∣vine Majesty who think that this Establish∣ment must fall thro' length of Time, without taking any farther notice of it?</P>
<P>Neither let the Difficulty of conceiving how the Sin of our first Parents could, in a rational way, be imputed to their Posterity, Prejudice any against the Reality and Truth of it; for seeing it is expresly revealed by GOD, it, surely, becomes us to believe it upon his Authority, and Rather charge our selves with Ignorance, than his Word with <HI>Falshood.</HI> But yet this Case will admit of reasonable Satisfaction, by considering, that all <HI>Adam's</HI> Posterity were equally involved and concerned with himself in that Covenant which God at first made with him, and himself constituted their Head and Representative therein; So that according to his Behaviour, it was to fare with them.
<PB N="17" REF="004117_0027_1003CE79CF78B950"/>
The substance of this Covenant is briefly re∣lated, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.17. and the Tenor of it was, a Promise of an immortal Life of Happiness, in the blessed Favour and Enjoyment of <HI>God,</HI> to him and all his Off-spring, upon condition of his Obedience, and a Threatning of the contrary Miseries, upon condition of his Disobedience. Now, according to the Terms of this Covenant, upon <HI>Adam</HI>'s Transgression, Guilt and Condemnation plainly and necessa∣rily followed upon all the human Race. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Covenant Relation of <HI>Adam</HI> to his Posterity, is also plainly insinuated, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. where the Apos∣tle compares <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> together, particu∣larly, <HI>Ver.</HI> 14.19. so that as <HI>Christ,</HI> when he was in the World, acted and suffered, not in a pri∣vate Capacity, but, as a publick Person, repre∣senting others, in the Covenant of Grace; so it was with <HI>Adam</HI> in the Covenant of Works, and therefore, <HI>ver.</HI> 14. he is called the <HI>Figure of Christ,</HI> who was to come.</P>
<P>But here the greatest Question of all is, <HI>How it can comport with the Justice and Goodness of</HI> God <HI>to involve all Mankind in such a Cove∣nant, made with their first Parents, that has issued so much to their Disadvantage, and that without their Personal Consent?</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Answer</HI> to this, let i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be considered, 1<HI>st.</HI> That the Covenant was not adapted and com∣posed to their Disadvantage, tho' it has even∣tually proved so, but to their great Benefit; for, upon the Obedience of <HI>Adam,</HI> they had all been eternally Happy, secured against the
<PB N="18" REF="004117_0028_1003CE7CF6401790"/>
Danger of sinning and perishing, confirmed in an Immutable State of Holiness, like the An¦gels that are in Heaven. And is it not account∣ed Wisdom in Human Affairs for Persons to run some hazard of a considerable Loss, upon an apparent Prospect of a great Gain. Upon this Plan it is that the Mariner crosses the Ocean, and the Soldier fights in the Battle. And then, 2<HI>dly.</HI> Consider with this, that <HI>Adam</HI> was fully furnished and compleatly empowered for the Fulfilment of the Covenant condition, and as highly engaged to it, as any could be. He had every way as full Ability to perform the required Obedience, as any of them could have had separately for themselves, and as great Mo∣tives to excite hîm to Watchfulness and Dili∣gence, having his own Interest as much con∣cern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in it as theirs; so that our eternal Con∣cern was every whit as safe in his hand as our own. These two Considerations compared and well weighed together, I think, may yield abundant Satisfaction in this case, and sufficien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly make appear, that in this Method of Procedure with Mankind, which <HI>God</HI> in the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pth of his infini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Wisdom was pleased to fall upon, there was not the least Injury done them, but much to the Contrary. And surely the Sovereign <HI>God</HI> may do that which is Right and so highly Beneficial in its Tendency, without waiting the consent of the Creature; nay, whe∣ther it will consent or not. But it is highly to be presumed, that had our Representative,
<PB N="19" REF="004117_0029_1003B2BF58886540"/>
<HI>Adam,</HI> persevered in his Obedience, and we now enjoyed the happy Consequences of it, we had been ready enough to applaud the di∣vine Wisdom and Goodness appearing in such a Method. So that there is no room for those Tragical Out-cries in the World of injustice, in the Case of original Guilt. And whereas the <HI>Lord</HI> declares, <HI>That the Child shall not suffer for the Father</HI>'s <HI>Sin,</HI> it is spoken with reference to the Sin of our near Parents, who, tho' they bear a natural, yet stand in no such covenant Relation to us, as our first Parents did.</P>
<P>But possibly some of my hearers may ap∣prehend, <HI>That tho' the whole human Race did become guilty and condemned, upon them first Parents Transgression, yet all that Guilt is taken off and re∣moved from all Mankind, thro' the the Death of</HI> Christ, <HI>so that none come into this World and par∣take of the human Nature in a State of Condemnation.</HI> Such would do well to consider, when it was that this Guilt was done away; whether before or immediately after the Death of <HI>Christ.</HI> If it be said, that it was taken away from the begin∣ning, to soon as the Covenant of Grace was published to <HI>Adam,</HI> after the Fall, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15. or at any other Time before the Death of <HI>Christ</HI>; how then could the Apostle, say in his Day, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2<HI>s</HI> 3. <HI>WE ALL were by Nature the Children of Wrath, even as OTHERS.</HI> It could not be taken away only after the Death of <HI>Christ,</HI> for his Death was of the same Virtue and Efficacy since the Fall of Man to this Day.
<PB N="20" REF="004117_0030_1003CE864D8EEAB0"/>
It was thro' his Mediation and Death, that the Godly in all Ages were saved, even before, in reality, he died: And hence he is said to be <HI>slain from the Foundation of the World, Rev.</HI> 13.8. In short, if original Guilt was wholly taken away then, upon the Death of <HI>Christ,</HI> the Gospel must have been turned altogether into a new Model, from what it ever was before, agreeable to this new Article; whereas it has always been substantially the same, only under different Modes of Administrations, and in different Degrees of Light and Clearness, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.8. the Apostle says, <HI>God preached the Gospel before unto</HI> Abraham, (<HI>Gen.</HI> 12.3) saying, <HI>In thee shall all Nations be blessed.</HI> And I may say, that he preached before the Gospel unto <HI>Adam, Gen.</HI> 3.15. saying, <HI>The Seed of the Wo∣man shall Bruise the Serpent</HI>'s <HI>Head.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, we see that very deplorable Ef∣fects of the first Transgression, do yet remain upon Mankind, (as I have already observed.) And how these Effects Judicially inflicted up∣on Man, on the Account of the first Trans∣gression, such as will certainly, without ex∣traordinary supernatural preventing Grace, lead him to a very dreadful Damnation, (as natural Blindness, Stupidity and a depraved Will, do many) how, I say, such Effects can remain, and yet all the Guilt be taken away, is hard to imagine.</P>
<P>That passage, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.22. <HI>As in</HI> Adam <HI>all die, even so in</HI> Christ <HI>shall all be made alive,</HI> is
<PB N="21" REF="004117_0031_1003CE88A1BC71B0"/>
nothing to this purpose; for the Apostle is there speaking only of the Resurrection of the Dead at the last Day, as appears through the whole Chapter. The being <HI>made alive,</HI> which he here speaks of, is such whereof <HI>Christ</HI> himself is a Partaker; for it immediately fol∣lows in the next Verse, <HI>But every Man in his own order; Christ the first Fruits, afterwards, says he, they that are Christ</HI>'s (and the Time when they are to be made alive is) <HI>at his coming,</HI> and that is at the End of the World, <HI>Then cometh the End, says he, when he shall have deli∣vered up the Kingdom,</HI> &amp;c. and so the Meaning of the Words is plainly to this purpose, that as by <HI>Adam</HI> all his Posterity were subject to Natural Death, in a way of Judgment, so by <HI>Christ</HI> all his seed, <HI>i. e.</HI> they that are <HI>Christ</HI>'s, as <HI>v.</HI> 23. shall be quickened and raised from the Dead, in a way of Mercy and Love, to the full Consummation of their Happiness. This verse is only another way of phrasing the same Thing that he had said, <HI>v.</HI> 21. <HI>Since by Man came Death, by Man came also the Re∣surrection of the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>Another place of Scripture also is made use of in this case, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.18. <HI>As by the Offence of one, Judgment came upon all Men to Condemna∣tion, even so by the Righteousness of one, the free Gift came upon all Men to Justification of Life.</HI> For the right Understanding of this Scripture, you must observe, that the Apostle compares the Offence or Disobedience of <HI>Adam,</HI> and
<PB N="22" REF="004117_0032_1003B2CA331F3438"/>
the Righteousness or Obedience of <HI>Christ</HI> to∣gether, in the first Place, in that neither of them were meerly Personal, but both of publick Influence: Herein, he observes, they exactly agree; and therefore he says, <HI>As by the Offence of one, Even so by the Righteousne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of One.</HI> And then, <HI>Secondly,</HI> he compares them, not as to the Extent of their Influence, that is, as to the Number of Persons to whom they extend in their Effects, but as to the Efficacy and Power of it And in this part of the comparison, he observes, that the Righteousness of <HI>Christ</HI> has much the Advan∣tage, that it is much more Powerful in its Effects, than the Disobedience of <HI>Adam</HI>; for tho' the Disobedience of <HI>Adam</HI> was of suf∣ficient Efficacy to Condemn, yet the Righteous∣ness of <HI>Christ</HI> exceeds in Power, in that it is of sufficîent Efficacy to Justifie after this Condemnation, and that to everlasting Life; as he that rescues a Captive from an Enemy, must be stronger than he. This is very evi∣dently the Design of the Apostle, through this whole Context. To this purpose he says, <HI>v.</HI> 17. <HI>For if by One Man</HI>'s <HI>Offence, Death reigned by One, much more they which receive abundant of Grace, and of the Gift of Righteous∣ness, shall reign in Life by one Jesus Christ.</HI> And then the Meaning of this 18 <HI>v.</HI> is, as if the Apostle had said, seeing it is so that the Righteousness of <HI>Christ</HI> is of much more Ef∣ficacy and Virtue, than the Disobedience of
<PB N="23" REF="004117_0033_1003CE907633FDE8"/>
<HI>Adam</HI>; therefore it is plain, that as all those upon whom the Offence of <HI>Adam</HI> came, were Condemned by it, so, all those upon whom the free Gilt, by the Righteousness of <HI>Christ</HI> comes, are justified thereby, and delivered from this Condemnation, with such a com∣pleat Justification as is followed with everlast∣ing Life. Or, to vary a little from the very Words, As all those to whom the Sin of <HI>Adam</HI> is imputed, are thereby condemned, so all those to whom the Righteousness of <HI>Christ</HI> is imputed, must thereby be delivered from that Condemnation, justified and glorified So that the Apostle's design, is not to signify, that as many as were condemned by <HI>Adam,</HI> are justified by <HI>Christ,</HI> but that <HI>Christ</HI>'s Righte∣ousness is much more Efficacious than <HI>Adam</HI>'s Disobedience; so that those to whom it is ap∣plied, must thereby be justified from their Condemnation in <HI>Adam,</HI> and restored to that Life which they had lost in him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As if a Man, intending to set forth the great Power of Heat beyond Cold, should say, The Cold indeed seizes all Things with such Power as to harden them; but the Sun comes upon all Things with such Power, as to soften them again, even, when under the Power of the Cold. Who would imagine here, that the Heat and Cold were compared, as to the Latitude and Extent of their Influence, but as to their Efficacy upon the Things, which they are applied to.</NOTE></P>
<P>It remains then an unshaken Truth, that all Mankind come into this World in a State
<PB N="24" REF="004117_0034_1003B2CEAEBFAE90"/>
of Condemnation, by their Apostacy and Re∣bellion, in their first Parent, out of which none are delivered, through the Redemp∣tion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> until they are re∣newed and regenerated by the holy Spirit, even such as it pleases the <HI>Lord</HI> to remove out of this World, and save in their Infancy, must have the supernatural Principles of Faith, and all other Graces infused into their Souls, <HI>i. e.</HI> must be fitted and disposed for the exer∣cising of them, otherwise than they are by Nature; without which they cannot be <HI>meet to be Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light; for that which is born of the Flesh is Flesh,</HI> altogether unfit for the Enjoyment of <HI>God.</HI> And such as are advanced to a riper Age, to the Exercise of Reason, must actually believe in <HI>Christ,</HI> before they can be freed from their original Condemnation, or any other Guilt; for an Interest in <HI>Christ</HI>'s justifying Righteous∣ness, and partaking of the Benefits of his Me∣diation, is in the Gospel, suspended upon believing in him. But supposing it were so, that Mankind were not by Nature the Chil∣dren of Wrath, and came not Guilty and Condemned into the World, yet this would not much help the Case of Unbelievers. For,</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> They are condemned by their Actual and Personal Sins. By these they are laid under the Condemnation of <HI>God</HI>'s <HI>Law,</HI> sen∣tenced and bound over to Hell and Wrath.
<PB N="25" REF="004117_0035_1003CE9878F62F10"/>
The delivering of Mankind barely from origi∣nal Guilt had been of small Service, (indeed of none at all) to such as live to any Years, unless the inherent Depravity of their Na∣ture, were removed with it, and <HI>God</HI>'s moral Image, in which they were at first Created, again Restored upon them, and so provi∣sion made against their sinning actually in their own Persons. But, alas! we plainly see it is not so, <HI>for all have sinned, and come short of the Glory of</HI> God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3, 13. and if <HI>we say that we have no Sin, we deceive our selves▪ and the Truth is not in us,</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1, 8. yea, <HI>v.</HI> 10. if we say, <HI>that we have not sinned, we make</HI> God <HI>a Liar</HI>; and <HI>his Word is not in us.</HI> And the Law of <HI>God</HI> sentences the Person to pu∣nishment, that has broken it, and condemns him, to a heavier Damnation, than he was condemned to by his original Guilt. This condemning Sentence of the <HI>Law,</HI> is that which is called the <HI>Curse of the Law,</HI> which it issues out upon the Subject, so soon as ever he has, in the least, failed of perfect and exact Obedience to it, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3, 10. <HI>As many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curse, for it is Written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all Things, which âre writ∣ten in the Book of the Law, to do them.</HI> Here you see the <HI>Law</HI> curses and condemns the Sinner, and that if he should but break it in one particular, <HI>if he do not All things which are written in the Book of the Law</HI>; yea, <HI>if he
<PB N="26" REF="004117_0036_1003CE9BDAB60EF8"/>
continues not in</HI> this perfect Obedience, when∣soever he swerves from the <HI>Law</HI> in one Point, he is condemned by it. The <HI>Law</HI> will justify upon no other Terms, but an exactly perfect Obedience, without the least Flaw. If there is one Failure in it, the Per∣son is rejected and laid under the Curse, <HI>Jam.</HI> 2, 10. <HI>Whosoever shall keep the whole Law, and yet Offend in one Point, he is Guilty of all, i. e.</HI> he is as really condemned by the <HI>Law,</HI> and laid under the Curse, as if he had par∣ticularly broken every Precept: For it is a striking at the Foundation of the whole <HI>Law,</HI> a contemning of that Authority upon which the whole is established. And if this be so, then Oh! what an awfully aggravated Punish∣ment, must such be exposed to, who are yet in their condemned State, and have Thousands of Transgressions to answer for! Who spend their whole Lives in Sin, as all unconverted Persons do. The Furnace is daily waxing hotter for you, as you heap up the Measure of your Sins. Sin is not such a light and trivial Thing, as blind and stupid people Imagine: It is soon committed, and soon forgotten, and they don't commit it, as they think out of any mischevious Design, but only for some personal Satisfaction and Plea∣sure: And multitudes of Things wherein they come not up to the Strictness of the Divine <HI>Law,</HI> are only the Infirmities of hu∣man Nature, common to Man, which the
<PB N="27" REF="004117_0037_1003B34ADAB5A580"/>
Divine Majesty, will easily overlook. With these, or such like thoughts, if not with a more irrational and brutish Banter, they plaister over the Filthyness, the Detestable and Cri∣minal Nature of Sin, that that may not be discovered by them; But, Oh! Sirs, there is an infinite Evil in Sin; which the Damned see and feel. It is the Rebellion of a Crea∣ture, endowed with Rational Powers for a very contrary End, against the Author of its Being; against infinite Majesty and eternal Sovereignity. And those who can Sin so lightly against <HI>God,</HI> and be so stupidly un∣concerned about it, discover the Enmity and Hatred, that is in their Hearts against him. They hate his Holiness, and so his very Na∣ture; in all Sin there is an inexpressible de∣merit; so that it deserves an inexpressible Pu∣nishment, and accordingly <HI>God</HI>'s Holy <HI>Law</HI> dooms the Sinner to it. Those indeed, who have received <HI>Christ</HI> by a true Faith, whereby they are Sanctified and made sincerely Holy, (blessed be the gracious <HI>God</HI>) are brought out of this Condemnation, thro' his answering the <HI>Law</HI> for them: So that there is <HI>No Con∣demnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, Rom.</HI> 8.1. but Unbelievers have no interest in the <HI>Gospel</HI> Righteousness, <HI>viz.</HI> that which is by the <HI>Faith of Christ,</HI> as the Apostle calls it, <HI>Phil.</HI> 8.9. and so still stand condemned by the <HI>Law,</HI> under the Damning Guilt of all their Sins: <HI>For as many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curse.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="004117_0038_1003B2E3CB0A5EC8"/>Thus I have shown you, how Unbelievers have come into this Condemned State, which they are in: But yet this does not fully reach the Design of this Head, which is, also, to show how they come to be at present in this State of Condemnation, and that, when others are in a justified Estate, who have been actual Transgressors, and by Nature the Chil∣dren of Wrath, even as they. And therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> They are kept in their condemned State, by their Unbelief.</P>
<P>Now Unbelief has a two-fold Influence upon a Sinners Condemnation, <HI>viz.</HI> Privative and Positive, the 1<HI>st.</HI> has a Privative influence upon it, as it keeps them under their former Guilt, in their antecedent Condemnation, which they were brought into by the Imputation of the first▪ Trrnsgression and their own personal Sin; and so deprives them of being justified: And that without the Consideration of its making any addition to their Guilt. The only Relief of guilty Sinners, from their Condemnation, is thro' the Righteousness and Mediation of <HI>Christ.</HI> But, according to <HI>God</HI>'s wise Constitution in the Gospel, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have no Interest in the Righteousness of <HI>Christ,</HI> without the Grace of Faith; so that Unbelievers are altogether destitute of the Benefit of the Redeemers Mediation; and so st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll held in their Condemned State, by their Unbelief. <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.36. <HI>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting Life; and he that believeth

not the Son, shall not see Life, but the Wrath of</HI> God <HI>abideth on him.</HI> The Wrath of <HI>God</HI> abi∣deth on him. He does not say, it then comes on him, but it abides on him; signifying, that it was upon him before on other Ac∣counts, and still Continues so by reason of Unbelief, whereby he comes short of the on∣ly Remedy. To the same Purpose our <HI>Lord</HI> tells us in our Text, <HI>he that believeth not it condemned already</HI>; and the Reason of his be∣ing in this Condemned State follows, <HI>because he hath not believed in the Name of the only Be∣gotten Son of</HI> God. And then 2<HI>dly,</HI> Unbelief has a positive Influence upon the Sinners Condemnation, <HI>i. e.</HI> it not only keeps him under his former Condemnation, but it adds to it, as a Crime; by aggravating and heighten∣ing of his Guilt. How much heavier must it make the Sinners Condemnation, when he will not humbly acknowledge his condemned deplorable Condition by Sin, and heartily receive the <HI>Lord Jesus,</HI> wholly depending up∣on him for his Relief, as he is offered to him by the <HI>Lord</HI> of his infinite Compassion for that End, at least not using all possible En∣deavours to do so, but proudly slights Re∣deeming Mercy, and refuses his only Re∣medy.</P>
<P>And now you see <HI>Brethren,</HI> that Unbelie∣vers, such as are not united to <HI>Christ</HI> by Faith, are condemned both by the <HI>Law,</HI> and by the <HI>Gospel,</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> says, <HI>He that performs not all
<PB N="30" REF="004117_0040_1003B2EDCC2B47B8"/>
Things, which are written in the Book of the</HI> Law, <HI>shall be Damned, Gal</HI> 8.10. This is the Curse which it pronounces against him: But the Unbeliever has not done this. It's true there is an Appeal from the <HI>Law</HI> to the <HI>Gos∣pel</HI>; wherein Life and Salvation through <HI>Christ,</HI> is offered to Guilty and condemned Sinners that receive him by Faith, but the <HI>Gospel</HI> says, <HI>He that believeth not shall be Damned, Mar.</HI> 16.18. and he has not complied with the <HI>Gospel</HI>; and so is condemned by it. And there is no other Court of Grace to appeal to, and Oh! how dreadful is it when a Sin∣ner's last Remedy flashes the Fire of Hell in his Face.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> I proceed now to improve this Sub∣ject I have been insisting upon, by some Practical Inferences drawn from it. And,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st,</HI> If it be so that all Unbelievers, with∣out Exception, are in a <HI>condemned</HI> State; then it Informs us, that <HI>justification</HI> cannot be ob∣tained by our own Righteousness. No Per∣son, by their strictest obedience to the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> can be delivered from that Condem∣nation, which they are laid under by it. The <HI>Lord</HI> does not say, the profane Unbe∣liever, or the careless Unbeliever, that makes no Practice of the Duties of Religion, is con∣demned, but <HI>He that believeth not,</HI> indefinitely, without any Limitation, be he who he will, or do he what he will, Until he believes in <HI>Christ</HI> he is Condemned, and the Wrath
<PB N="31" REF="004117_0041_1003CECB4FF1E4D8"/>
of <HI>God</HI> abideth on him: And indeed, <HI>Justifi∣cation</HI> by our own Righteousness and <HI>Personal obedience,</HI> is inconsistent with the very Nature of Faith; wherein the Believer rejects all Dependance upon his own Goodness and Obedience, and leans entirely on the Righ∣teousness of the Redeemer. Moreover, you have heard, that whosoever would be justi∣fied that Way, by a <HI>Law</HI> of Righteousness, must produce a compleat one, without the least Imperfection; upon no other Terms can any Person be justified by his own Righte∣ousness. The <HI>Law</HI> will have a compleat exact Righteousness, in every Point and Degree, or none at all: If there is a defection in it, the <HI>Law</HI> is so far from justify∣ing, that it positively Condemns. And the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>God</HI> in this Form, is no other than his wise Establishment, which he has enga∣ged himself to stand by. And therefore, <HI>as many as are of the Works of the</HI> Law, <HI>are under the Curse,</HI> because they have not done all Things which the <HI>Law</HI> required; for it says, <HI>Cursed is every one that continues not in All Things which are written in the Book of the</HI> Law, <HI>to do them.</HI> Unbelievers are so far from perfectly fulfiilling the <HI>Law,</HI> that, the Truth is, no Person can yield any Obedience, that is any way pleasing to <HI>God,</HI> till he is first justified: <HI>Justification</HI> and <HI>Renovation</HI> always go together, and the one is never without the other; and so an Unjustified Person, being an Uncon∣verted
<PB N="32" REF="004117_0042_1003CED828E471E0"/>
Person, cannot obey God in any Thing, with a <HI>Gospel</HI> Sincerity; all his Obe∣dience flowing from an unsanctified Heart. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.8. <HI>They that are in the Flesh cannot please God.</HI> And how then can all their Obe∣dience, remove their Condemnation, and re∣commend them to <HI>God</HI>'s Love? When his holy Eye sees no Beauty but much Unclean∣ness in it.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> What has been spoken, clearly Informs us of the great Blindness and Stupid Ignorance of such as Think they are in no great Danger; because they are small Sinners. From hence they derive the Peace and secure Quiet of their Consciences, that they are not Guilty of such gross Immoralities as many others, they have taken care to abstain from such Things as are offensive to <HI>God,</HI> and have committed but little Sin against the divine Majesty; And therefore, they think they can be in no great Danger of Perishing, but if any are in a safe State, sure they must. Ah, poor unhappy Creatures! None under Heaven are in greater Danger than you, Witness the Moral <HI>Pharisee, Luk.</HI> 18, <HI>v.</HI> 11, 12. In the first Place, it is explain evidence of the gross Darkness of your Minds that you think you have been Guilty of so little Sin; when perhaps, in the mean Time, you go on in the continued neglect of Gods positive Com∣mands, as if that were no Sin. But however this be, it is plain, you do not see the secret Wickednessess of your Heart, which are a very

Mystery of Iniquity: For you have an inward dislike at real holiness and walking with <HI>GOD</HI>; And so entertain a secret enimity in your Hearts against <HI>God,</HI> and hate his moral Image.

And such as make any Thing else but the Redeemer's Merit the Foundation of their Peace, thinking well of their Condition, either because they are Guilty of little Sin, or because they Perform the external Duties of Religion, are sorry for their Sins, or the like, are utter Strangers to a saying Faith. Neither is it enough to profess, and superficially believe that you are miserable and undone without <HI>Christ,</HI> and that no other way you can possibly be saved but thro' his Mediation; Persons may maintain all this, and profess it as their Judgment, and yet never, in reality, came to <HI>Christ,</HI> but rest on something else, Unless the Dispositions and Actings of your Hearts be agreeable to these Truths, unless you so believe them as to be answerably affected by them, what signifies your Orthodox Belief: It is but a dead Faith, that will not profit you. And yet, alas! this is all the Faith that many Professors content them∣selves with. They Think well of themselves because they profess these great Truths of the Gospel, as the Articles of their Faith, and pity such as don't know so much, or maintain a contrary Opinion; but a true Faith in <HI>Christ</HI> is a sensible and lively Operation of the Soul, wherein the Person is affected suitably to what he believes, and does, in an active manner, lean,

of it, and the Mistake prove fatal and deadly. The glorious God, in the unsearch∣able Depths of his Wisdom, has laid out and established a compleat and most astonishing Method for the Deliverance of condemned Sin∣ners out of their Condemned State, and bring∣ing them to a state of Life and Happiness in the Favour and Enjoyment of himself. He also of his infinite and distinguishing Goodness has given us the invaluable Blessing of his holy Word, wherein he has clearly revealed that Way in which alone condemned Creatures can be justified and delivered our of their Condem∣nation, and requires our hearty and thankful Complyance with it; so that most undone Creatures shall we be, after all, if through our own Wickedness, we mis-apprehend it, and set up a Way of our own in Opposition to his, which was the fatal Case of the Unhappy Per∣sons spoken of in our Text. The Persons here spoken of were the greater part of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, who rejected the Lord Jesûs, and would not believe in him as their Saviour. In vers. 1. the Apostle expresses a very tender Re∣gard and Compassionate Concern for them, <HI>viz. My hearts Desire and Prayer to God for</HI> Israel <HI>is, That they might be Saved.</HI> And <HI>vers.</HI> 2. he offers one Thing, which excited and much moved his Concern for them, <HI>For</HI> (says he) <HI>I bear them Record that they have a Zeal of GOD, but not accor∣ding to Knowledge.</HI> That is, they have a Zeal in things respecting God, in the things which
<PB N="49" REF="004117_0059_1003CF72648CC020"/>
they look upon to be the Laws and Ordinance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of God, but it is a Zeal attended with very great Ignorance and Blindness, so that they come short of the true, Motives that should excite their Zeal, and miss the principal Mark, to which their Zeal should bend. And tho' the Apostle had a universal and Unlimited Compas∣sion for the perishing Souls of Men, yet this Consideration concerning those of his own Nation, very intimately touched his Heart, that they had such a Zeal for God, and yet altoge∣ther one of the Way of God. This he also observes of them, to introduce him to what he was further about to say concerning them in our Text; wherein he tells us a very great and weighty Thing, which they were ignorant of, with the miserable Tendency and issue of their Ignorance in this point, <HI>They were Ignorant of Gods Righteousness.</HI> It will give Light to this whole Text, rightly to understand what the Apostle means here by <HI>God's Righteousness.</HI> —— It is not to be understood of the Moral Perfection of his being, whereby be is a Holy and Righteous <HI>GOD</HI>; this the <HI>Jews</HI> were not so ignorant of; they knew that God was a Holy and Just God; but it is to be understood of that Righteousness which God has appointed for the Justification of a Con∣demned Sinner; which he distinguishes from the Righteousness of the <HI>Law, v.</HI> 5. and calls it <HI>The Righteousness which is of</HI> (or by) <HI>Faith, vers.</HI> 6. Here observe, Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whatsoever is available for
<PB N="50" REF="004117_0060_1003B33A746B8288"/>
the Pardon of Sin and instating the Sinner again into the Love and Favour of God, so that he is again entitled to that Eternal Blessedness which he had forfeited by Sin, as fully as if he had never Sinned; that, I say, is fitly called a Righteousness, and that upon two Accounts: 1<HI>st.</HI> Because Righteousness consisting in a Per∣fect Obedience to Gods Law, was the only Condition upon which Gods Favour and our Eternal Happiness was at first promised; hence therefore, whatsoever answers in the Place of that Personal Perfect Righteousness, is fitly called by the same Name, is as much as it supplies the Place of it, and answers to the same End. And 2<HI>dly,</HI> whatsoever is sufficient to obtain the foresaid Ends, is called <HI>Righteousness,</HI> because it is such in its own Nature; for nothing can be available to the Justification of a condemned Sinner but a perfect Conformity unto, and ful∣fillment of the Law, both in us Precept and Penalty; So answering the Demands and Char∣ges which the Law lays in against the Sinner: Thus, the Merit of <HI>JESƲS Christ</HI> is called <HI>Righteousness</HI> in both these Respects, as it obtains that End for us, when received by Faith, which a Personal Righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eousness of our own would have done; And as it is properly Righteousness in ît self, being an Obedience yielded to the Law of God, as you shall further hear by and by.</P>
<P>Now, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is about this Righteousness, whereby a Sinner can be justified, who has broken
<PB N="51" REF="004117_0061_1003CF7ADEE3BAE8"/>
Gods Law, and is thereby Condemned to Hell, and rendred utterly incapable of ever obtaining Happiness upon the Terms of the first Cove∣nant, that the Apostle is here speaking. And it is that Righteousness wich God has provided and established for this End, which he calls the Righteousness of God; because it is of God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s appointing, and that Righteousness which he only will accept of for the Sinner.</P>
<P>And then by their own Righteousness he means their Personal obedience to the Law of God, which they set up as that Righteousness by which they would, and expected to be Justi∣fied: which is the meaning of their <HI>going about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o establish their own Righteousness</HI>: It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their setting it up as a Righteousness to recommend them to God's favour, and be Justified by, and their Diligence in obeying the Law of GOD with that view and for that End, <HI>viz.</HI> That they might work out a Righteousness sufficient to deliver them from their Condemnation, and instate them in the divine Favour. But Mark the deplorable Consequence and Effect of this Practice of a Legal and self-dependance; It kept them out of the way tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God has appoint∣ed for a Sinner's Justification, beside which there is no other: for, <HI>going about to estab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh their own Righteousness,</HI> proposing that, to obta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Reconciliation &amp; Peace with God by, <HI>they did not submit themselves to the Righteousness GOD:</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="004117_0062_1003B3421E6A29D0"/>
They did not comply with that Method which he had appointed, did not submit to that Righ∣teousness which he had established for that End Whence it is plain that the Righteousness which GOD has appointed for a Sinner's Justification, is some other than our own Personal obedience▪ For the <HI>Jews</HI> were Ignorant of it, and did not submit to it while they were establishing their own Righteousness. The Expression of, <HI>not submitting themselves,</HI> shews that their Pride and high Conceit of themselves as well as their ignorance was a great Cause of their following scuh a device for their Justification, and keeping out of Gods Way Here observe, that thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ignorance of God's Righteousness was a grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cause of their High conceit of, and dependance upon their own: And both together was the cause of their not submitting to God's Right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ousness.</P>
<P>And then, <HI>vers.</HI> 4. the <HI>Apostle</HI> declares what this Righteousness of God is, which he has set forth for the Justification of a Sinner.

<HI>Him God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his Blood, to declare his Right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ousness for the Remission of Sins.</HI></P>
<P>In this Verse two Things are to be taken notice of, 1<HI>st.</HI> A great benefit by <HI>Christ,</HI> ex∣pressed in these Words, <HI>Christ is the End of the Law for Righteousness</HI> And, 2<HI>dly,</HI> the Persons to whom it belongs, <HI>every one that believeth.</HI> Here then we must enquire what is meant by <HI>Christs</HI> being the End of the Law for Righteousness? And <HI>first,</HI> Negatively, the meaning is not that he has disanulled, abrogated and taken away the Law, so as Believers are rendred Lawless, and no more bound to Obedience; For says the same Apostle, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3.31. <HI>Do we then make void the Law thro' faith</HI>? God forbid: yea, <HI>We establish the Law.</HI> It's true, <HI>Christ</HI> in this sense, was the End of the Ceremonial Law consisting of Sacrifices, Offerings, &amp;c. But the Apostle here speaks of the Law in general, especially of the Moral Law, comprized in the ten Com∣mandments, and understands the <HI>End of the Law,</HI> in another sense, when he says, <HI>he is the End of the Law for Righteousness</HI>; That is, he is so the End of it as to furnish the Sinner with a Righ∣teousness sufficient to answer the Demands of it for his Justification This way he is the End of it; which is quite another Thing than the Abolishing of it. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s further evident from the Apostle's limitation, <HI>to them that believe</HI>; for n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lievers nor Unbelievers, since <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, are under any Obligation to the Ceremo∣nial
<PB N="54" REF="004117_0064_1003CF865457B7C8"/>
Law. Again, it is plain, that the Law which the Apostle here speaks of, is that Law by the obeying of which the Unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> in the former Verse, looked to be justified, which was the Moral as well as the Ceremonial Law. I am not saying, that the Ceremonial Law is not here at all intended, but that it is not only intended; and that <HI>by the End of it,</HI> is not meant its abrogation, otherwise than by a necessary consequence. And therefore in the next Place, positively, <HI>Christ</HI> is said to be the <HI>End of the Law for Righteousness,</HI> in respect of the Cere∣monial Law, as it was instituted and designed for the End, to typifie and prefigure him in his Mediatorial Office. As his Mediatorial Righ∣teousness was the End which the Washings, Sacrifices and Incense of the Ceremonial Law pointed at and held forth. This was the mise∣rable Blindness of the Unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> that they lean'd upon their Ceremonial Observances as proper Atonements for their Sins in them∣selves, and that their Guilt was thereby taken away. And the Apostle here Informs them, that the Righteousness of <HI>Christ</HI> is that alone by which a Sinner can be justified, which all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Ceremonial Blood and Incense, with many other Things of that Law only signified and pointed at. They were never designed for the Justifi∣cation of Sinners by any proper Virtue of their own, but to shadow forth the great Ato∣ning Sacrifice of <HI>Jesus Christ: For it is not possible that the blood of B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls and of Goats should take away
<PB N="55" REF="004117_0065_1003B34952B5FA60"/>
Sins, Heb.</HI> 10 4. In Christ only is that Righ∣teousness which can deliver the Soul from the Guilt and Condemnation of Sin, and whereby all that truly believe in him are justified: It was not in all the Ceremonial Services of the Law; they only pointed at and referred to it in him; and thus he is the End of the Ceremonial Law for Righteousness to every one that belie∣veth.</P>
<P>And then as to the Law in general, <HI>Christ</HI> may be said to be <HI>the End of the Law for Righteousness,</HI> in two respects, 1<HI>st.</HI> By answering the End for which the Law was given, by fullfilling it, and so working out a Righteousness for the Justification of those who had broken it. The Law was given for that End, that it should be obeyed, and that Man by obeying it, should have everlasting Life; Now <HI>Christ</HI> submitted himself to the Law, and perfectly obeyed it in what it required of the Sinner, both as to its Precept and Penalty; and by that Obedience has wrought a sufficient Righteousness for Believers to obtain Eternal Life by. And so when <HI>Christ</HI> is said to be the <HI>End of the Law for Righteousness,</HI> in this sense the meaning is, that by his Obedience which he has yielded to it, he has obtained for Sinners that End for which the Law was given, and which they should have attained by it, had man never sinned, but per∣fectly fulfilled it, <HI>viz.</HI> Everlasting Life and Happiness, This is the Language and Tenor of the Law, <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man which doth these Things shall
<PB N="56" REF="004117_0066_1003CF8F28DBA3F8"/>
live by them, Rom.</HI> 10.5. So that the End which the Law proposed to the subjects to ob∣tain by it, was Eternal Life and Happiness: And the Righteousness which it required, for the obtaining of this End, was a perfect obedience to it, upon the least defect it lays the Person under condemnation, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10. But all mankind have wofully broken the Law of <HI>GOD</HI>; either, representatively, in their first Parent, or both representatively, in him, and Personally themselves; and therefore can never obtain Happiness by the Law, that is, upon the Law's terms of an absolutely Perfect and Personal Obedience. Now the Lord <HI>JESƲS</HI> has perfectly obeyed the Law, in the utmost of its demands upon the Sinner, which Obedi∣ence is, by God's appointment, for a Justifying Righteousness to those who by Faith receive him, so that thereby they obtain that Life and Happiness which was at first proposed upon the terms of the Law, but is now utterly Un∣attainable that way. And thus he is the End of the Law for Righteousness to every one that believeth, see <HI>Rom.</HI> 8, 3.4. But then▪</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Consider, in the Law there are two parts, <HI>viz.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Precept, whereby it requires Obedience, and its Penalty, whereby it requires Punishment for Disobedience. Now tho' <HI>Christ</HI> is not the End of the Precept of the Law, so as to take away the Believers Obligation to Obedience; yet, he is the End of the Penalty, Malediction and Curse of the Law, so as to take
<PB N="57" REF="004117_0067_1003CF94CB074DA0"/>
away their Obligation to punishment. He takes away the Law's Process against them; So that it no longer requires Punishment or Satis∣faction of them, he having satisfied and under∣gone the Penalty of the Law in their Room, and thereby furnished them with a sufficient Righteousness to answer all the Charges and <HI>demands</HI> which the <HI>law</HI> has to lay in against them, as Bars in their Way to Happiness and Glory. The Laws Penalty has no more to require of them; according to <HI>Gal,</HI> 3.13. <HI>Christ has redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us.</HI> And tho' the Law, as to its Precept, remains an unalterable Rule of Righteousness, and so requires Obedience from Believers; yet, it is not required as the Term or Condition of their Justification before GOD Their Justifica∣tion is put altogether upon another Foot, than it was in the Law, or Covenant of Works: The Spotless Obedience which the <HI>Lord JESƲS</HI> paid to the Precept of the Law being accepted in the Room and Place of the Obedience requi∣red by that Covenant in the case of Justification.</P>
<P>And thus is he the End of the Law for Righteousness to every one that believeth And here it is to be observed, that in all these Senses, the general Scope and design of the Words is the same, <HI>viz</HI> That the Righteous∣ness whereby a Sinner can only be Justified and delivered from the Condemnation of the Law, is in <HI>JESƲS CHRIST.</HI> To him alone the Sinner must come for it, or be forever undone</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="004117_0068_1003B38A80698B88"/>The second Thing to be taken notice of in this <HI>Verse,</HI> is, the Persons who are justified by the Redeemers Righteousness, <HI>Every one th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t believeth.</HI> This Clause, as it extends Justifica∣tion by Christ to all Believers, so, it limits it to them only, and shows the necessity of Faith in <HI>Christ,</HI> in order to an Interest in his <HI>Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus explained the Text, and put it in a just Light, it affords us the following Pro∣posi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Truth for our Instruction;</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<P N="1">1<HI>st. That Ignorance of the Method which GOD has appointed in the Gospel for a Sinners Justification, is a Ruinous and Soul-destroying Ignorance.</HI></P>
<P>This Truth is sufficiently contained in the Text: for when they were ignorant of Gods Righteousness, the Apostle tells us, <HI>they want about to establish their Own</HI>; And so went quite out of the Way of God, out of the Method of the Gospel, <HI>not submitting themselves to the Righteousness of GOD</HI>; and surely, Methods of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own devising, in Opposition to God's, will not do: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God, in the infinite Riches of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> established a Way for the Recovery of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sinners out of Condemnation and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rely it becomes and concerns us imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to look after the right Knowledge of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with all our Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s thankfully to comply <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which if we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but Trust to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Devices of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Heart, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Ahab▪</HI> 2 <HI>King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> set up an Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Lords</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the certain Conse∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Igno∣rance,

what is this but a proud Contempt of God's Love and Mercy? And a depriving him of the just Glory and Honour of the New-Covenant way of Salvation?</P>
<P>For the more full Confirmation of this Truth, consider, and Compare together these two or three Conclusions. 1<HI>st,</HI> That there is but One Way of Sinners Justification appointed by GOD in the Gospel; for this see <HI>Rom</HI> 3.20 to 25. <HI>therefore by the Deeds of the Law there shall no Fesh be Justified in his fight▪ for by the Law it the knowledge of Sin; but now the Righteousness of GOD without the Law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets; Even the Righteousness of GOD, which is by Faith of JESƲS Christ unto all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no differ∣ence; for all have sinned, and come short of the Glory of God; being Justified freely by his Grace, thro' the Redemption that is in JESƲS CHRIST.</HI> Here the Apostle plainly shows, that there is but One Way appointed by God for the Justification of a Sinner, with a particular Specification of that Way; telling us, that it is thro' the Righ∣teousness of Jesus Christ, that Righteousness which the Soul apprehends in him by Faith: and proves, that there is no difference in G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s Method of Justifying, because th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re is no real difference in those th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> are to be justified. They are all in the same sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul and Guilty case; <HI>for all have sinned, and come short of the Glory of GOD.</HI> And therefore, all they that are Justified are only Justified in this w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> freely, by his G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
<PB N="60" REF="004117_0070_1003B3575FC64318"/>
thro' <HI>the Redemption that is in JESƲS CHRIST.</HI> 2<HI>dly</HI> God requires that Sinners comply with that Way which himself has appointed, believe in it, and depend upon it; otherwise they can∣not be Justified by it. The whole New Testa∣ment plainly declares the necessity of Faith, in Order to Justification, as <HI>Mark</HI> 16 <HI>vers.</HI> 16. <HI>He that believeth shall be saved: But he that believeth not, shall be damned, Joh.</HI> 3.36. And, 3<HI>dly,</HI> Consider, that without a knowledge of it there can be no Faith in it. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.14. <HI>How shall they believe in him of whom they have not Heard?</HI> There can be no saving Faith without Knowledge, nor can believe in that Way of Salvation which they are ignorant of; and so their Ignorance infallibly Bars up the Way of Salvation against them, according to God's wise Constitution in the Gospel.</P>
<P>Now, this Ignorance is so destructive and pernicious upon two Accounts, 1<HI>st.</HI> As it is a Crime that deserves Damnation, But here you must observe, that this is peculiar to those who live under the Gospel, enjoying the means of Knowledge. As for the poor <HI>Pagans,</HI> tho' it is their great Unhappiness not to know the Way of Salvation thro' the Redeemer, yet it is not their Sin, because they have not the Means of Knowledge: But, O! what a God-pro∣voking Iniquity must it be in such as live under the hearing of the Gospel, and have the exercise of Reason! For it is a stupid will∣ful Ignorance, in a matter of the greatest Con∣cern
<PB N="61" REF="004117_0071_1003CFA15C36D6E0"/>
always joyned with Insolence and con∣tempt. It is a Brutish Thoughtlesness about your Eternal State, and haughty Disregarding of the greatest Kindness and Mercy of the great God. There is a twofold Ignorance of the Gospel-Way of Justification, that justly comes under this Censure, <HI>viz.</HI> A bare simple Ignorance of it, that is, when Persons have not so much as the Idea or Conception of it in their Minds, and an Ignorance of its being such; tho' the thing it self, which the Scriptures teach as such, be understood, and thought of; that is, when Persons know what is miantained by the Orthodox Church to be the Righteousness which God has appointed for the Justification of a Condemned Sinner; but are ignorant that it really is that Righteousness, and does not acknowledge it for such, but positively denies it, substituting a Righteousness of their own for that End, in the Place of it. And this seems to be the Ignorance principally charged upon the Unbelieving <HI>Jews</HI> in my Text; for many of them well knew what was the Apostles Doctrine upon this great Article of Justific<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tion, teaching, that the crucified Lord Jesus, was the only Saviour of Sinners, thro' the merit of whose Death and Sufferings only Remission of Sins could be obtained; but they would not acknowledge this to be the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghte∣ousness of Gods appointment for the Justification of Sinners. This they were ignorant of, thro' their own Wickedness. And this is the woful
<PB N="62" REF="004117_0072_1003CFA678EAD8B8"/>
Ignorance of many precious Souls that we pe∣rishing by it at this Day, whereby they Sub∣vert the very Foundation of the Gospel, and overturn the whole Frame of it; against whom the Apostle pronounces that dreadful Anathen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1.9. <HI>If any Man preach any other Gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</HI> And then,</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> This Ignorance is so destructive, priva∣tively: in as much as the condemned undone Sinner is thereby rendred utterly incapable of applying to his only remedy; So that he is there∣by Held in his condemned State, under the Guilt of all his Sins. So that, laying aside the heinous, Criminal and Provoking Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure of this ignorance, yet, it is to be dreaded as Hell it self; because while it continues it infallibly keeps the Soul from deliverance out of his undone Condition, and exposes him to a certain damnation for all his other Sins.

<HEAD>Proposi. <HI>2.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A Second Proposition which this Text affords us, is, <HI>That Sinners Dependance upon their own Righteousness for Justification keeps them out of the way which GOD has appointed for that End.</HI></P>
<P>This Proposition has a very clear Foundation in the Text, <HI>Going about to establish their own Righteousness, they have not submitted themselves to the Righteousness of GOD.</HI> And Chap. 7.31, says the Apostle, <HI>Israel which followed after the Law of Righteousness, hath not attained to the Law of Righteousness.</HI> They were seeking after a Righteousness whereby they could be absolved from the Guilt of their Sins, and instated in the Love and Favour of God, but they did not at∣tain to it. And <HI>vers.</HI> 32. the Apostle puts the Question; Wherefore? Why was it that they did not attain to it? <HI>Because</HI> (says he) <HI>They sought it not by Faith, but,</HI> as it were, <HI>by the Works of the Law.</HI> They were seeking it by their Works of Obedience to Gods Law, and did not come to Christ for it by Faith, rejecting all Dependance upon any thing else; and therefore they fell short of it. Now, from hence it is evident, that altho' Persons be never so circumspect, diligent and careful in obeying the Laws and Commands of God, yet, if they depend upon that to recommend them to Gods saving Favour, and so make a Saviour of their own Righ∣teousness, putting it in the Place of Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey are out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> way of the Gospel▪ and shall

finally be Rejected of God. Oh, how many Souls will be wofully disappointed here! What multitudes derive all the Peace of their Minds and quiet of their Consciences, from their Moral Living, and good Doings: They have never come truly Humble and Poor in Spirit to Christ: Such unhappy Creatures the great God will reject, with abhorrence, for rejecting <HI>JESƲS CHRIST,</HI> the dear Saviour, and thinking to appear before his Holy and pure Majesty with their filthy Rags, as the Prophet calls them, <HI>Isa.</HI> 64.6.

<P>Another Doctrinal Truth arising from this Passage of holy Scripture, is <HI>That there is such Pride and self-conceit in Sinners Hearts, that they are
<PB N="65" REF="004117_0075_1003CFAA91927960"/>
very unwilling to steep to GOD's Way for their Justi∣fication.</HI></P>
<P>So much is clearly implied in that Expres∣sion, <HI>They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not submit themselves unto the Righteousness of God.</HI> They were too high for such a stoop. O <HI>Sins</HI>! It is this baneful Pride of Heart that keeps Souls from the Lord <HI>Jesus.</HI> They cannot bear to humble themselves, so low as to acknowledge their Condemned State, their Wretched Helpless Condition, as it is, and come to Christ alone for their Relief, <HI>Poor in Spirit, Labouring and heavy Laden under a sense of their Guilt and Misery.</HI> No; they think their Condition is not so bad as that comes to, yet; that is, they have not such need of Christ; he may go to them that are in a worse Case; as for their Parts, They thank him for his kind offer, but their Case is not so bad, and they can help themselves, they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ert-whole and easie, thro' a vain Conceit of some commending Worth and Excellency in themselves. This was the rusul care of the <HI>Laodicean Church, Rev.</HI> 3.17.</P>
<P>This Proposition will admit of a little varia∣tion, with equal Evidence from the Text; And so you may observe,</P>
<P><HI>That the way which GOD has established for Sinners Justification, is a Soul-humbling, self-abasing Way, very contrary to the Pride of their Nature.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord requires that Sinners Humble themselves very low at the Feet of Christ

sensible of their absolute Necessity of him for their Saviour, and their undoneness without him; so that they entertain no hope from any thing else but his Mediation: But how much is this against proud Nature, to lye strip't of all Self-Righteousness at the Redeemer's Feet!

<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> I shall shew you what is that Righte∣ousness of Christ, through which alone a sinner can be justified. And</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> Shall prove and confirm the Proposi∣tion.</P>
<P>I would here intreat your closest and most careful Attention to what may be spoken upon these Heads, because this great Doctrine of a Sinner's Justification, is something difficult to understand, and yet very necessary to be under∣stood, as I have already shown you. It is diffi∣cult to such Earthly Thoughtless Souls as have never made Religion much of their study; and yet these Persons, as if they had diligently look'd into all the Doctrines of the Gospel with an Angel's Eye, presently disregard any thing they don't understand at the first hearing. You ought to consider, that the Mysteriea of <HI>Chri∣stianity</HI> are not so mean as that a thorough Know∣ledge of them should be so easily obtained, and therefore it concerns you to apply your selves to them with the utmost care and diligence. I shall endeavour to speak to these Heads proposed, as clearly and plainly as I can, that, by the bles∣sing of the Almighty, the Ignorant may be in∣structed, and the Erroneous convinced. And</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I am to open and show you the Nature of a Sinner's Justification, that great benefit which the Scriptures so much speak of. In the last
<PB N="68" REF="004117_0078_1003B36A050B0400"/>
Sermon which I delivered here, I show'd you that condemned State which Mankind have brought themselves into by sin, with a particu∣lar Application to Unbelievers, as their present State, which they still continue in, while such. I show'd you how they came into it, by which it is clearly evident, that all Mankind were equally under the same Condemnation, having broken God's Righteous Law, which, without respect of Persons, condemns the Breakers of it. And my design now, from this Passage of holy Scripture, is to show you, the Way whereby Sinners can only be delivered out of this deplorable Estate. The Method which God has provided and established for that end. Now as the inherent Depravity and Wicked∣ness of the Soul, the corrupt Quality and Dis∣position of the Sinner is Remedied by Sanctifi∣cation, so his Condemned State is Remedied by Justification. It is the delivering of the Sinner from his Condemnation to Hell, and en∣titling him, upon the contrary, to the Happi∣ness of Heaven. I shall endeavour to give you a just View of it under this Definition, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Justification is a Judicial Act of GOD, wherein he acquits the Sinner of his Guilt, and gives him a Title to Eternal Happin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss.</HI></P>
<P>In this Definition you may especially observe two things concerning Justification. 1<HI>st.</HI> The parts of it, which are Two; or, there are two
<PB N="69" REF="004117_0079_1003CFB0883DECA0"/>
things done for the Person in Justification; He is freed from Guilt, and entitled to Glory. By <HI>Guilt</HI> understand the Sinner's Obligation to the Punishment of Hell, which comes by the Condemning Sentence of the Law, which he is fallen under. Now in <HI>Justification</HI> this <HI>Condem∣ning Sentence</HI> is taken off and so his Liableness and Obligation to Punishment. According to <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1. <HI>There is now no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus.</HI> So that when a Sinner is said to be acquitted of his Guilt, absolved or deliver∣ed from it, the meaning is, that the Condemning Sentence of the Law which he was under, is taken off, and he is secured against the danger of Hell's Punishment, which before he was bound over to. The Gospel suppersedes the Law, and over-rules it, as it were, so as it pronounces the Person Free, who by the Law was sentenced to Death; thus says, the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.2. <HI>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, hath made me Free from the Law of Sin, and Death.</HI> And yet the Law and Gospel do not oppose each other; For none are acquited by the Gospel until the Laws Demands upon them, are answered; as you shall farther hear, <HI>viz.</HI> by <HI>JESƲS CHRIST</HI> for them.</P>
<P>The other part of Justification, is the giving to the Sinner a Title and Claim to Eternal Happiness. This is done for him in his Justifi∣cation; for Eternal Happiness, in the Glorious Enjoyment of <HI>GOD,</HI> was at first promised to Man upon the Terms of the Law, the terms
<PB N="70" REF="004117_0080_1003CFB2EF782920"/>
of Perfect Personal Obedience, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.5. And therefore, a Title to Life being once granted in the first Covenant, it must be again restored to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Sinner in the very Act of Justification; because it is a pronouncing him Free from all the Changes and Accusations of the Law, which it has to lay in against him, as Bars to the En∣joyment of that happy and Eternal Life which it first promised. Had the Condition of the Law or first Covenant been fulfilled, Eternal Life had thereby been obtained; and therefore, nothing can hinder any Man from the Enjoy∣ment of it but the Laws objecting against him, as not having fulfilled the Condition upon which it was promised; and so, when all the Objecti∣ons of the Law are answered, and the Sinner is freed from them, as fully as if he had perfor∣med the Condition of the Law, a Title to Life must necessarily be again restored.</P>
<P>In those two things consists what is done for the Sinner in his Justification. And hence you may easily understand what is meant by these Passages of Scripture which speak of the For∣giveness and Remission of Sins, the blotting out of Iniquity, the covering of Sin, and the like: All which belong to the head of Justification. The meaning is, that the Lord will look over the Sinner<HI>'s</HI> Sin, in his way of dealing with him, as to his Eternal State, as if it had never been; as if he had perf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctly fulfilled the Law, deliver∣ing him from that Punishment which his Sin exposed him to, and giving him that Titdle to
<PB N="71" REF="004117_0081_1003CFB4741CE1A0"/>
Life and Happiness which his Sin had forfeited. From what has been said, you may also observe, that Justification does not consist in any thing that is wrought in the Sinner, as to his Dispo∣sition and Quality; that belongs to Sanctification, but in what is done for him, respecting his State, which is what is cheifly intended when it is cal∣led an Act, rather than a Work of <HI>GOD.</HI> It is necessary that you consider this, and understand Wherein Justification consists, and so carry a right Notion of it along with you, through the whole of this Discourse; otherwise it will be no wonder if you don't understand what may be spoken of it.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> In the Definition you have the general Nature of Justification; when it is called a <HI>Judicial Act of GOD</HI>: whereby is signified, that God proceeds in it as a Judge, passing this Absolving Sentence upon Trial, when the Per∣son is first acquitted by the Law. In Justifying a Sinner, The Lord has regard to his own Law; he will see that all the Demands which the Law has upon him, are answered, before, he will, or can Justifie him, justly, consistently with his own Law, According to that, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.25, 26. <HI>whom GOD hath set forth to be a Propitia∣tion, thro' Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteous∣ness for the Remission of Sins — to declare,</HI> I say, at this time, <HI>his Righteousness, that he might be just, and the Justifier of him that believeth in JESƲS.</HI> In these Words the Apostle observes the neces∣sity of Christ<HI>'s</HI> Death for a Sinner's Justification,
<PB N="72" REF="004117_0082_1003CFB60D08C2F0"/>
to maintain and manifest God's Righteousness and Justice, as well as his other Perfections therein: so, clearly intimating, that he could not be just in justifying a Sinner, unless the Law had been thus satisfied. God at first conditionally annex∣ed a Penalty to his Law; that in case sin should be committed, it should infallibly be pu∣nished; that the Sinner should not be relieved unle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Penalty were fully sustained: This was the Method which God determined, and engaged himself to prosecute sin in; and there∣fore, he cannot Justifie a Sinner, justly, without Acting contrary to his own Appointment and establish a Law, unless the Penalty be under∣gone in his behalf, by an Undertaker for him. Thus it was necessary that Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist should so answer the Law for the Sinner; for the vindi∣cating of Gods Righteousness in his Justifica∣tion; that he might be just when he justifies him that believeth in JESUS. So that you see, all the claims of the Law must be answered to the extent, before a Sinner can be justified. Hence that <HI>Matt.</HI> 5, 18. <HI>Till Heaven and Earth pass, one Jot or one Tittle shall in no wise pass from the Law, till all be fulfilled.</HI> The Law will not abate one jot or its Demands, but all must be fulfilled. And here, by the way, it may be remark'd▪ that this one Consid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ration were sufficient to evince that a Sinner's Justifica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion can only be obtained thro' the Righteousness of JESUS Christ; bec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use nothing else, is sufficient to an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wer the Deman<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the Law. And indeed all the Er∣rors
<PB N="73" REF="004117_0083_1003B37118F3D140"/>
in this point that are in the World, whereby Persons look to any Thing else for their Justi∣fication before GOD, proceeds from a gross Ignorance of the true Nature of Justification.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Having set before you a breif and just View of the Nature of Justification, I come now to show you what that Righteousness of Christ is, thro' which alone this great Benefit can be obtained, as the Material and Meritorious Cause of it. And,</P>
<P><HI>First, Negatively,</HI> It is not the essential Righteousness of his Nature, whereby he is eternally Righteous, &amp; Holy. Neither, 2<HI>dly,</HI> His Righteousness in the Administration of his essen∣tial or Mediatorial Government which he daily exercises in the World. Nor yet, 3<HI>dly,</HI> Is it the Inherent Righteousness or Sanctification of Be∣livers, which he works in them by his <HI>holy Spirit.</HI> This Righteousness indeed, is in all those that are Justified, so as none are Justified but they are also Sanctified and Holy: But yet their Holiness and inherent Goodness is not that Righteousness by which they are justified. It is rather the Fruit than the Cause of their Justifica∣tion. None are truly Sanctified before they are justified: Justification and the New Nature always go together, and its discovering it self in its proper Acts immediately follows the Per∣son's Justification. Hence <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.5. In Justi∣fying, God is said to Justifie the Ungodly. A Believers Inherent Righteousness can never answer the Demands of the Law for him, and
<PB N="74" REF="004117_0084_1003CFB955B2A448"/>
therefore, cannot be his justifying Righteousness. It is necessary to take away the Power and Dominion of Sin in the Heart; But can never take away the Guilt of Sin. I am as much for Holiness of Heart and Life, as any can be, and say, that without it no man shall see the Lord, being altogether loathsome in his sight, and unfit for the enjoyment of him; So that <HI>except a man be born again he cannot see the Kingdom of GOD</HI>; and therefore, it concerns you, with the utmost earnestness and diligence, to seek after Holy and Sanctîfied Hearts, that you may be enabled to glorifie God, and fitted for the glorious En∣joyment of him. But, tho' you must seek the Graces of God's holy Spirit for your Sanctifi∣cation, you must look to something else for your Justification; for your Deliverance from Guilt and Condemnation, and entitling you to the Glory of God; for Reconciliation and Peace with him. There are some that will speak very plausibly of Justification by the Righteousness of Christ only, but when they fully explain themselves, they mean nothing else but the inherent Righteousness of the Godly, which Christ works in them, upon which ac∣count they call it his Righteousness: which bewrays a very great Ignorance of the Nature of Justification.</P>
<P>But in the next Place, <HI>Positively,</HI> The Righ∣teousness of <HI>Chrîst,</HI> which only is available for a Sinner's▪ Justification, consists in what he has done and suffered when he was in the World, in
<PB N="75" REF="004117_0085_1003CFBCC26B52E0"/>
the Room and behalf of Sinners. And so, it is generally divided into his active and passive Obedience. By his <HI>active Obedience</HI> is understood his obeying the Precept of the Law, by a uni∣versal Perfect Holiness. This Obedience of his was absolutely Perfect, without the least Defect; so that the Father testified of him, <HI>that in him he was well pleased,</HI> and himself says, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.29. <HI>I do always those Things that please him.</HI> By his <HI>Passive Obedience</HI> is meant, that Obedience which he yielded to the Penalty of the Law, in bearing that Punishment which it required of the Sinner: Which was not only his dying upon the Cross, and sustaining many other greivous Sufferings inflicted upon him by his Malicious Enemies, but his Bearing the Lawful Weight of Gods Wrath it self in his Soul. God the Father laid his own Hand upon him: it pleased the Lord to bruise him, he put him to Grief, and made his very Soul an Offering for Sin, <HI>Jes.</HI> 53.10. This infinite Pressure and Load upon his Spirit was that which made him say, <HI>My Soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto Death, Matt.</HI> 26.38. This was that inexpressible Agony of his Soul, <HI>Luke</HI> 22.44. which ex∣pressed such a Sweat of Blood from his sacred Body, as he lay in the Night upon the cold Earth: for he fell both upon his Knees and upon his Face. <HI>Matt.</HI> 16.37. He was forsaken of his Father, as to the sensible Comforts and Supports of his Love, in the midst of his grea∣test Miseries; which occasioned that bitter
<PB N="76" REF="004117_0086_1003CFBE7092F790"/>
Out-cry upon the Cross, <HI>Matt.</HI> 27.46. Eli Eli Lama Sabachtha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. So great and weighty was the Load of Sufferings which our dearest <HI>Saviour</HI> bore, both in his Body and his Soul, that it would have over-press'd and crushed a World of Creatures under it; but he being God as well as Man, his Divine Nature supported the Human under it, so as it did not fail before it. Now, both this <HI>Active</HI> and <HI>passive Obedience</HI> of Christ make up that one compleat Righteousness, whe∣reby Believers are Justified, And both are necessary in order to Justification: His Passive Obedience, to deliver Sinners from the Punish∣ment of Hell, and all obligation to it. The Law of God binds over the Sinner to a dread∣ful Punishment, which must be sustained, either in his own Person, or by a surety in his Room, So that it is the Sufferings of Christ alone that can deliver Sinners from the Condemnation of the Law. According to <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.13. <HI>Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse of the Law; being made a Curse for us.</HI> Hence says the Apostle, 1. <HI>Pet,</HI> 2.24. <HI>His own self bare our Sins, in his own Body, on the Tree. i. e</HI> He bore the Punish∣ment due to our Sins, which otherwise we must have suffered for ever. 1. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1.7. <HI>The Blood of Jesus Christ his Son, cleanseth us from all Sin.</HI> 1. <HI>Pet</HI> 3.18. <HI>For Christ also hath once suffered for Sins, the Just for the Ʋnjust.</HI> The Law of GOD cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mned them to Punishment, Christ suffered it for them; and hence it is that they are deliver∣ed And then, as the Passive Obedience of
<PB N="77" REF="004117_0087_1003B375AA7581C0"/>
Jesus Christ is necessary to answer the Penalty of the Law for the Sinner, and so deliver him from Punishment; so, also, the Active Obe∣dience of Christ is necessary to answer the Con∣dition of the Law for him, and so entitle him to Eternal Glory. For the Condition upon which Eternal Life was at first promised, was no other than Perfect Obedience; which Con∣dition must be fulfilled before the promised Life can be obtained. But, alass, Mankind have universally failed in the Performance of this Condition; <HI>for all have sinned, and come short of the Glory of GOD, Rom.</HI> 3.23. And the Law still objects against the Sinner, and holds him desti∣tute of any Claim to happiness, or interest in it, nay, lays an infallible Bar in the way, while its Condition is not fulfilled. Our blessed Lord Jesus has perfectly fulfilled it, in the Discharge of his Mediatorial Undertaking; and hence it is the Believers are entitled to Glory; thro' his performing the Condition of the Law, his Obedience being accepted for them: <HI>Therefore,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.19. <HI>As by one Mans Disobedience many were made Sinners; So by the Obedience of One shall many</HI> be made Righteous, As by <HI>Adam's</HI> disobedience all his Posterity were look'd upon as Sinners, and so deprived of all Tittle to the promised Life; So by Christ's Obedience all Believers are look'd upon as Righteous, as if they had fulfilled the Condi∣tion of the Law; and so are entitled to eternal Life. Christ has answered the Condition of
<PB N="78" REF="004117_0088_1003CFC008A8A4F0"/>
the Law for them; were it not so, we should all be most undone Creatures: We should never see the Face of God in Peace. Thus I have shown you that Righteousness of <HI>JESƲS Christ,</HI> whereby he is the End of the Law, to every one that believeth. I have set it before you in both its parts, answering to the two parts of a Sinner's Justification; and pointed out to you, particularly, how the one answers the other.</P>
<P>And now I am advanced to the <HI>Third General Head proposed,</HI> which was to confirm the Truth of the Doctrine, and prove, <HI>That the only Righ∣teousness which God has established for the Justifica∣tion of a Condemned Sinner, is this Righteousness of his Son Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>The Truth of this sufficiently appears from what has been already said under the fore∣going Head; but for the fuller Confirmation of it, I shall take the Proof of it under a par∣ticular Consideration by it self.</P>
<P>And to this purpose you my observe, That the whole current of the Scripture runs this way. The whole New-Testament, wherein God has clearly revealed the Gospel-Method of Salvation, very evidently flows in this Channel, attributing a Sinner's Deliverance from Con∣demnation and Wrath, and his Title to Glory and Happiness to the Obedience and Suffer∣ings of our Lord Jesus Christ alone, as the sole Cause thereof. It cannot be more fully and plainly expressed, than it is <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.24, 25. <HI>Be∣ing
<PB N="79" REF="004117_0089_1003CFC273AA93E8"/>
Justified freely by his Grace, through the Redemp∣tion that is in Jesus Christ; whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation, through Faith in his Blood, to de∣clare his Righteousness for the Remission of sins.</HI> See also <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.13. <HI>Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us.</HI> It is Christ that hath delivered the Godly from the Curse of the Law; and that by being made a Curse for them, by bearing that Punishment for them, which they were condemned to. To the same purpose is that 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.21. <HI>Ho hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</HI> Rom. 5.8, 9. <HI>But God commendeth his Love towards us in that while we were yet Sinners, Christ dyed for us; much more then, being now Justified by his Blood, we shall be saved from Wrath thro' him; for if when we were Enemies, we were Reconciled to God by his Son,</HI> &amp;c. Mark, he says, <HI>Justified by his Blood, and Reconciled to God by his Death.</HI> And vers. 19. he tells us, <HI>That by the Obedience of Christ shall many be made Righteous.</HI> But were I particularly to mention all the Passages of Scripture that speak to this purpose, I should recite a great part of the New Testament, with much of the Old; Through the whole 53<HI>d Chapter</HI> of <HI>Isaiah</HI> is this Truth clearly revealed, of a <HI>Sinner's Justifi∣cation through the Righteousness of Jesus Christ</HI> the Promised Messiah; hence <HI>Jer.</HI> 23.6. he is call'd, <HI>The Lord our Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>Again, I shall further confirm this Truth by the following Induction, <HI>viz.</HI> A Sinner
<PB N="80" REF="004117_0090_1003B37B1A119D50"/>
must be justified, either without any Consider∣ation at all, to answer the Law as a Satisfaction to Justice, or by <HI>his own Righteousness,</HI> his Works of Obedience to the Law, or by <HI>his own Righ∣teousness</HI> in Conjunction with the <HI>Righteousnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Christ</HI>; Or by the <HI>Righteousness of Christ alone</HI>; But by neither of the former, therefore by the the latter. As for the <HI>Popish</HI> Dream of being helped by the <HI>Merits of Superrogatory Works of Others,</HI> I hope, it is generally exploded in these parts of the World.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> A Sinner cannot be justified without any Justification made to the Law. For, 1<HI>st,</HI> That would be contrary to Gods own Establish∣ment, as you have heard. To speak with due Reverence of the divine Majesty, he has not reserved to himself that Power. Whether the Lord might have so ordered it, consistently with the Justice of his Nature, as <HI>That Sin could have been pardoned without any Justification,</HI> I shall not dispute; but, it is plain, that for holy and wise Ends, he has ordered it otherwise. He is very express in the Law, <HI>In the Day Thou ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est thereof, thou shalt surely Dye.</HI> And, <HI>Cursed is every one that contînueth not in All things which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them.</HI> The Sove∣reign God has so constituted Things that proud Sinners must come to Christ by Faith, and bow to him, or perish. 2<HI>dly,</HI> If Sinners can be justi∣fied this way, then Christ has dyed in vain; than which nothing can be more absurd. Had it not been altogether vain and needless for
<PB N="83" REF="004117_0091_1003CFC5CB02F840"/>
Christ to have laid down his Life, and bore such a load of Sufferings, if the great end of it could have as well been obtained without it? And this Consequence the Apostle looks upon as most absurd and unreasonable; and so proves, that Persons cannot be justified by their own Righteousness, because this Consequence would also then follow, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.21. <HI>If Righteousness came by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We can never be justified by our own Righteousness by our exactest Obedi∣ence to the divine Law. This fully appears by the very Nature of Justification, as it is a <HI>Judicial Act of God,</HI> wherein all the Claims of the Law must be answered, which <HI>Our best Righ∣teousness</HI> can never do. Nothing is more plainly and expresly declaimed against in the holy Scrip∣tures than <HI>Justification</HI> by any <HI>Goodness</HI> or <HI>Righ∣teousness in Ʋs,</HI> of which our Text is a sufficient Instance. See also Gal. 2.16. <HI>Knowing that a Man is not Justified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of JESƲS Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be Justified by the Faith of Christ, and not by the Works of the Law: For by the Works of the Law shall no Flesh be Justified.</HI> And <HI>vers.</HI> 21. <HI>If Righteousnest come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain.</HI> And Chap. 3.10, to 14. <HI>As many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all Things which are writ∣ten in the Book of the Law to do them,</HI> but that no Man is Justified by the Law in the sight of <HI>God,</HI>
<PB N="82" REF="004117_0092_1003CFC752B137A0"/>
it is evident. <HI>For the Just shall live by Faith; And the Law is not of Faith: but the Man that doth them shall live in them; Christ hath redeemed us from the Curse of the Law, being made a Curse for us.</HI> How fully does the h. <HI>Apostle</HI> disclaim all Depen∣dance upon his own Righteousness, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.8.9. when he counts all things but <HI>Dung that he might win Christ, not having his own Righteousness which is of the Law, but that which is by the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God by faith.</HI> That is, the Righteousness of Christ, which is received and depended upon by Faith.</P>
<P>There are many Objections and Cavils brought in here, by such as are going about to establish their own Righteousness, and will not submit themselves to the Righteousness of God; They will say, doubless, <HI>If our Obedience to Gods Law will not Justifie us, if it will not avail to deliver us out of Condemnation, and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>concile us to GOD; Why then should we obey, or take any care to serve the Lord? it seems it will do us no good.</HI> For <HI>Answer</HI> to this, Consider, 1<HI>st.</HI> The Will of God requiring us to Honour and Serve him, in such and such things, is reason sufficient why we should do so! God is our great Proprietor and Sovereign King, whose Will we ought to obey: He has an incontest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble, necessary Right to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and our Service, from the exalted Per∣fection of his Nature, and our Relation to him as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Creatures. From him we received our being, and all our Endownments; and hence we are under the strongest Bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to live to him,
<PB N="81" REF="004117_0093_1003B37FAA953AD8"/>
to glorifie and serve him. Certainly nothing can give a surer Propriety and stronger Right than Creation; but such a Right has GOD to us his Creatures; which, together with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> essential Glories and Peerless Perfections of his Nature, were Reason enough without any more, to engage us to the purest Obedience to his holy Law; and would effectually do so, if Sin had left any ingenuity in us.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Altho' our obedience to God is not the Procuring Cause of our Justification, yet it is the Way which God has appointed to seek for an interest in Christ's Justifying Righteous∣ness in. It is the only Way in which God has given any encouragement to Sinners to obtain Justification, thro' the Righteousness of <HI>Christ,</HI> so as that while they continue in a course of Diso∣bedience, and do not humbly and heartily seek for an Interest in Christ, in the Way of his Commands, they may surely expect to come short of it; and so perish in their Sins, It is morally impossible that a Sinner should be unit∣ed to Christ (without which he cannot be justified by him) while he goes on in a course of Opposition to him. A Sinners Humble, Hearty and Persevering Application to GOD, with a due sense of his present Undone Con∣dition, for the divine Mercy thro' the Redee∣mer, is the Way to come to Christ, and get an interest in his Righteousness for his Justification: So that it is a false Consequence from the Doctrine I am confirming, <HI>That our earnest Endeavour
<PB N="84" REF="004117_0094_1003CFC8D99869F8"/>
to seek God and serve him, are Needless and to no Purpose.</HI></P>
<P>But further, Consider, <HI>Thirdly</HI> That all those who are united to Christ by Faith and so Justi∣fied by his Righteousness have a new Nature implanted in them, whereby they make holiness their choice; their Hearts in freely and sweetly determined for it, and set upon it, they have a very dear love for the Lord JESUS, on whom their Eyes are fixed for their Salvation; So that they want above all things to Please and serve him. Thus, the Principle and Spring of their Obedience is not a blind Expectation of procuring their Justification by it, tho' they don't allowedly put any trust in it for that End; yet they yield to God a more full and free Obedience, from the purer Principle of a sincere Love which is the only true Obedience that is pleasing to God: and indeed, no Person is ever truly Holy until he rejects all dependance upon his own Righteousness, and leans on Christ alone: His Obedience is never sincere till then; but flows from base and selfish Prin∣ciples altogether. It is plain, that such as make use of the Objections I am speaking to, and think they would be at no pains to serve God, if thereby they could not, at lest in part, be Justified, it is plain, (I say) that they are only obeying for their own Ends, from a Principle of Self-love, and not from any Affectionate Regard or pure love to God; and so their Righ∣teousness, which they are so highly concerted
<PB N="85" REF="004117_0095_1003CFCAD47AA918"/>
of, is altogether unsound, loathsome unclean in the Eyes of GOD.</P>
<P>Thus you see, that the Doctrine of a <HI>Sinner's Justification thro' the Merits of JESƲS CHRIST, and the impossibility of it by his own Righteousness,</HI> is no enemy to the practice of Holiness; but is that which only advances it.</P>
<P>Again, it may be objected, that David <HI>expresses great Confidence in his own Righteousness, and attributes much to it, Ps.</HI> 7.8. <HI>Judge me, O Lord, according to my Righteousness, and According to mine Integrity that is in me,</HI> And Ps. 18.20, <HI>The LORD rewar∣ded me according to my Righteousness, according to the cleanness of my Hands hath he recompensed me.</HI> But <HI>David</HI> in these Places is not speaking of the Justification of his Person before God, as it that were the Effect of his Righteousness; but of God's Kindnesses to him in the course of his Providence; especially, in delivering him from his unjust Enemies, and exalting him above them. This is what he means by <HI>being rewarded according to his Righteousness.</HI> And by <HI>his Righte∣ousness</HI> he, particularly, means his Righteousness in the cause between him and his Enemies, that he had given them no just Provocation, and in a meek becoming manner he had bore all their unjust and cruel Treatment. And so, in the 7<HI>th Psalm</HI> (which was composed on the account of the wicked Words of <HI>Cush</HI> the <HI>Benjaminites</HI> against him, as you may see in the Title pre∣fixed to the <HI>Psalm</HI>) he prays that God would, Judicially, in a way of Justice interpose between
<PB N="86" REF="004117_0096_1003B38625B8A1A8"/>
him and his Enemies, and deliver him from them, as he was altogether innocent in the case, between them; and then he praises the LORD that he had done so, in the 18 <HI>Psalm,</HI> which was a <HI>Psalm of Thanks-giving,</HI> when the Lord had delivered him from the Hand of <HI>Saul</HI> and all his Enemies. These expressions of <HI>David</HI> are to be understood in the same sense with those of <HI>Solomon,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 6.22.23.</P>
<P>It is farther objected, <HI>that God has made sincere Obedience the Condition of our obtaining eternal hap∣piness, and has made many glorious Promises to it.</HI> It's true, there are many precious Promises made to the Godly, and to them only; but they are made to them thro' JESUS CHRIST, and upon the account of his Mediation. And they are made to the Godly, and none else, because all those that are Justified thro' the Redemption that is in JESUS Christ, and none else, are Godly; and hence, tho' the Promise of eternal Life is not given to any, but only upon the account of Christs Righteousness, yet it is made to the Qualification of sincere Piety; because only they who are sincerely Pious have an In∣terest in his Righteousness, and are Justified by it; and their Sanctification and Holiness is the sure and only Evidence of their Justification, whereby they can discover their Title to Hap∣piness and In<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erest in God's Promisses. It is for her true, that God will make his People the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>more Glorious in Heaven, the more Holy they have been upon Earth, the more pains they
<PB N="87" REF="004117_0097_1003CFCE5FEF7210"/>
have been at to glorifie him here, and the more they have suffered on that account, the greater shall their Glory be hereafter, 2. <HI>Cor</HI> 4.17. which may be a very moving Encouragement to them: But it was not any goodness in them which at first gave them a Title to the Heavenly Glory; That they obtained only thro' the Re∣deemers Righteousness; tho' for their higher degrees of Holiness and Serviceableness after∣wards, they shall receive the gracious and undue Reward of a higher Glory in the other Life: But what is all this to the delivering of the Soul first out of his Condemned State, the freeing him from his Guilt and Obligation to the Punishment of Hell, and making him an Heir of God? What is all this to the answering the Demands of the Law for him, both in its Con∣dition and Penalty; all which is done for him in his Justification. Sure I am, the Scriptures never attribute this to any Righteousness in us; no, not to the goodness of the holiest Man on Earth, but only to the Righteousness and spot∣less Obedience of our dear Lord and Saviour.</P>
<P>Once more; Many to establish their own Righteousness, are ready to say, <HI>that we must be Justified by our own Righteousness, because at the last Day we shall be judged and rewarded according to our Works. Rom.</HI> 2.6. <HI>God will render to every Man according to his De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds.</HI></P>
<P>The holy Scriptures, indeed, abundantly witness, that at that Day we shall be dealt with according as our Works have been; but this
<PB N="88" REF="004117_0098_1003CFD1E3E94C60"/>
no ways infers that Justification is of Works <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for, altho' good Works will be the Rule ac∣cording to which God will dispense the Reward of Eternal Life; you it will not be given for them, but only for the Merits of the Lord JESUS. Tho' it shall be given only to the Righteous, yet it is not for their Righteousness that they shall obtain it, but for the Righteous∣ness of the Redeemer; Because they were justi∣fied thro' him. And, notwithstanding such as have been more Eminent in Holiness shall receive a more Glorious Reward; yet it is a reward, not of Debt, but of Grace: And (as I have, but now, show'd you) is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgument of their being justified by their own Righteousness.</P>
<P>Thus I have Considered some of the most Material and common Arguments that are made use of to maintain Justification by a Personal Inherent Righteousness, and proven, that it can∣not be obtained that Way.</P>
<P>But 3<HI>dly.</HI> May some say, <HI>Altho' our own Righ∣teousness it self will not fully Justifie us, yet, may it not go se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of the Way for our Justification? It will justifie us in part, and is necessary together with the Righteousness of Christ for that End. Both together are sufficient, but neither alone.</HI></P>
<P>To which I answer, That no Righteousness of ours has any Hand or Interest at all in our Justification. It will not go all the Way, it will not to one hairs breadth. A perfect and compleat person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Righteousness (such as none of their ordinary Posteri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of fallen <HI>Adam</HI> can
<PB N="89" REF="004117_0099_1003B3889B88E3A0"/>
pretend to) will compleatly Justifie; but if it is not absolutely Perfect, it will not contribute the least Mite. The Law will have an exactly perfect Righteousness, without the least Defect, or none at all; saying <HI>Cursed is every one that continueth not in ALL THINGS that are written in the Book of the Law to do them</HI>; And Christ will admit of no Co-partners with him in the case of a Sinner's Justification: he will be a whole Saviour or no Saviour; and therefore says the Apostle to the <HI>Galatians, Chap.</HI> 5.4. <HI>Christ is be∣come of none Effect unto you, whosoever of you are Justified by the Law, Ye are fallen from Grace</HI>; That is, whosoever of you are seeking in any measure to be Justified by the Law's Terms, by your own Obedience to it, Christ will be of no benefit to you; if you will look to the Law for any part of your Justification, you must look to the Law for it altogether: Christ's Righ∣teousness must not be joyned with your own in the case: you that are doing so, are fallen from the Gospel method of Justification thro' free Grace, thinking in part at least, to procure it by your Works; <HI>and that which is of Works, is not of Grace, Rom.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.6.</P>
<P>I have now showed you that a Sinner cannot be Justified without a Righteousness to answer the Law for him, and that he cannot be Justified by his own Righteousness, neither in whole nor in part, it remains then, that there is no other way for his Justification, but through the Merits and Right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ousness of JESUS Christ alone,
<PB N="90" REF="004117_0100_1003B3EC615DE2A8"/>
according to <HI>Acts</HI> 4, 12. <HI>There is no Salvation in any other; For t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e is none other Name under Heaven given, among men whereby we must be saved.</HI> And 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 3, 11. <HI>Other Foundation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, than that is laid, which is JESƲS Christ.</HI> The Doctrine of a Sinner's entire justification thro' the imputed Righteousness of Jesus Christ, is the very Foundation Article of the Gospel; and such as are proposing to obtain it any other way, dash and blur the whole Beauty of the New-Covenant, disrobe the adorable Contri∣vance of Salvation of all it's Glory, and over∣throw the very Frame of the Gospel: Yea, they deprive the Lord Jesus of the just Honours of Redemption, and detract from the Glory of his Mediatorial Office; and unless they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re con∣vinced, in Time, will find in the End, that by it they have ruined and undone their Souls for∣ever: For it proceeds from a stupid and God-provoking Insensibleness of your Condemned State and Wretched Condition by sin; from a naughty proud Conceit of some Self-worthiness, whereby you think to be, at least, Partners with Christ in procuring your Happiness, by your poor wretched Doings. It infallibly keeps the Soul from receiving and leaning upon the Lord Jesus by a true Faith, without which it is impossible to be saved; <HI>He that believeth not shall be damned.</HI> O Sirs! It is not such a light matter as you may imagine, what you are look∣ing to for your Salvation; the Unbelievers shall have their Portion in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke that burns with

unquenchable Fire, <HI>Rev.</HI> 22, 8. <HI>Luk</HI> 12.46.</P>
<P>And now, (to make some <HI>Application</HI> of the fore-going Doctrine) you see how and where the Relief of undone Sinners, from their Con∣demned State, can only be had; and let me in∣treat you, solemnly and impartially to consider these Things, and yield your Assent to these great Truths. Labour to be suitably influenced and affected by them, so as to bring them to Practice. Consider what a Condemned State Sin has brought you into, out of which you must be delivered, or perish forever. Consider that your own Righteousness will not bring you out of it; If you trust to that for your Justification, you will find your selves eternally deceived; you will never be able to stand it in the Day of Trial, when you appear before the great Judge. Unless you are found cloathed with the Redeemer's Righteousness, <HI>and have your Robes washed and made White in the Blood of the Lamb,</HI> Rev. 7.14. you will never be able to stand. And O then acknowledge your Guilty and Condemned State by sin! Reject all De∣pendance upon your selves, and fly to the Lord Jesus alone for your Relief. Receive him for your only Saviour, giving up your selves, with true Hearts, to him, to be for him, and none else, to serve him while you live.</P>
<P>To excite you to this, and further to Re∣commend the Doctrine of <HI>Free Justification thro' Christ alone.</HI> I would propose to your Consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r∣ation <HI>the Sufficiency of his Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="004117_0102_1003D005C026BA10"/>It is Sufficient in Three Respects, in point of Worth and Value, in point of Acceptance, and in point of Attendance.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is of <HI>Sufficient Value</HI> to procure Justi∣fication for Sinners which fully appears from the Perfection of his <HI>Active Obedience, the De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his Sufferings, and the Dignity of his Person</HI> con∣cerned in both. His <HI>Active Obedience,</HI> was abso∣lutly perfect; so that he compleatly fulfilled the Condition, upon which the Law promised Eternal Life to Man. The <HI>weight of his sufferings</HI> was inconceivable; so that be fully bore the Penalty of the Law. And the <HI>infinite Dignity</HI> of his <HI>Person</HI> put an infinite Value on them; So that his Sufferings of a finite Duration, were of equal value, for the answering of the Law's Penalty, to a whole Eternity of Sufferings in a meer Creature: For he is God as well as Man; He <HI>is Immanuel, GOD</HI> with us: God and Man in one Person. But, tho' the Righteousness of Christ be of sufficient Value to purchase Sinners Redemption; yet it is not fully sufficient, unless God will accept of it for the Sinner; and he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly justly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon the Terms of a Perso∣nal Satisfaction, which the Sinner cannot give, but by suffering for ever. But, O! behold the admirable Grace and Love of the Father; he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bundantly declared his pleasedness with the Righteousness of his dear Son, so as who∣soever leans upon it, by a true Faith, shall be accepted by it. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.6. <HI>Behold, I lay it</HI> Zion <HI>a Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f-Corner-Stone, elect▪ precious; and he
<PB N="93" REF="004117_0103_1003B3BB4D395488"/>
that believeth on him shall not be confounded.</HI> We have God's own Word for it, that▪ an undone Sinner need not fear to lean the whole Weight of his Guilty Soul, and all his Eternal Concerns on Jesus Christ. Neither in the last Place, is there any danger of a Believers perishing thro want or neglect of Application of the Virtue of Christ's Righteousness to him▪ Indeed a thing may be sufficient for a particular End upon all other Accounts, and yet, for want of attendance and looking after, may never Effect it; but there is no danger of that here: The Lord <HI>JESƲS</HI> who died has rose again, and ascended into the highest Heaven, there to appear in the presence of God for his People, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.24. He is exalted at Gods Right Hand, looking after the Application of his Righteousness to the Redeemed; making Intercession for his People that believe in him; pleading the Merit of his Righteousness for them; and will in the End, bring them, against all Opposition, to eternal Glory in the Virtue of it. Hence the Apostle deduces such matter of Consolation from the Resurrection, Exaltation and Intercession of Christ <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.34 and in other Places, <HI>Heb.</HI> 7.25. <HI>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the utter∣most that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Intercession for them.</HI> Thus you see that Christ's Righteousness is the only sin; Foun∣dation for the Soul to lean upon. Let others trust to what they will, I desire with the Apostle to be sound in him, not having my own Righ∣teousness
<PB N="94" REF="004117_0104_1003D00EF5D34048"/>
which is of the Law, but that which is by the faith of Christ. O Sirs! There is no where else where you can find Relief; And Wo, Wo, will be to you forever, if you do not come to Christ that you may have Life,</P>

<P>THese words (according to what I before observed to you in the Explanation) are brought in here to shew what is the Righteousness which God has appointed for the Justification of a Condemned Sinner; for the freeing him from the Claims and Charges of the Law against him; Teaching us, that it is only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be found in <HI>Jesus Christ</HI>; and (as I have f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll▪ made appear from the holy Oracles)
<PB N="95" REF="004117_0105_1003D016A52746B8"/>
Consists in what he has done and suffered in the Discharge of his Mediatorial. Undertaking, when he was Bodily present in this World. And the inspired Apostle not only, in the gene∣ral, declares what the Sinner's only justifying Righteousnes is, but particularly Characterizes the Persons that are accou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thereby, pointing forth what is the great Qualification requisite in order thereunto, telling us, <HI>That Christ is the End of the Law for Righteousness to every one that believeth.</HI> By which last Words (as I before observed) he not only extends the Bene∣fit of Justification to all Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>vers, but also, limits and restrains it to them only. And so the Point of Truth from hence, now to be insisted upon is, that</P>
<P><HI>Faith in Christ is necessary in Order to Justification by him.</HI></P>
<P>The Truth of this Proposition is sufficiently attested by the Word of God, <HI>Mark.</HI> 16.16. <HI>He that believeth shall be saved, but he that believeth not, shall be Damned.</HI> Joh. 3.18. <HI>He that believeth on the Son is not Condemned: But he that believeth not, is Condemned already; Because he hath not believed in the Name of the only begotten Son of GOD.</HI> So vers. 36. <HI>The Wrath of God still abides upon the Ʋnbe∣liever.</HI> Gal. 5.5, 6. <HI>We, through the Spirit, wait for the Hope of Righteousness by Faith; for in Jesus Christ neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Ʋn∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ccision, but Faith which worketh by love.</HI> And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) the Righteousness of Christ is called <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Righteousness of Faith, Rom.</HI> 4.11. and 10.6. and

<P>The Method in which I propose to speak to this great Truth, is,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> A little to open up the Nature of Faith in Christ, and show you what it is.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> To show you its Necessity, in this case of a Sinner's Justification, by considering the Interest and Concern that it has in it.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> To consider something of the Excellency and Beauty of this Method of a con∣demned Sinner's Recovery, thro' Faith in the Righteousness of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I return to the first of these, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I am to open the <HI>Nature of a true Faith in Christ.</HI> It is well described in our <HI>shorter Catechism</HI> to be <HI>A saving Grace, whereby we receive and rest upon Christ alone for Salvation, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he is freely offered to us in the Gospel.</HI> Agreeable to his (that I may speak as clearly upon it as I can) take this Description of it, <HI>viz. Faith in Christ is a saving Grace, whereby a Person receives him for his only Saviour, leans and depends upon his Righteousness, and that only, for his Justification before GOD, and all things that he stands in need of.</HI></P>
<P>In this Description you may especially take notice of these two or three things. 1<HI>st.</HI> That
<PB N="99" REF="004117_0107_1003D021C63F8C60"/>
a very Principal Benefit which a Person in be∣lieving rest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon Christ for is his Justification, to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elivered from the Guilt of Sin, and Condemnation of the Law, and consequently, from dese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved damnation▪ and to be entitled to Eternal Happiness, and, consequently, in the End, actually to obtain it, and be glorified in Heaven. This a Person in believing, especially in his first Closure with Christ, Principally respects, and has his Eye primarily upon; for this he is most intimately and awefully concerned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> But yet he stops not here, but all things that he wants, and that GOD has promise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he looks for tho' Christ alone, upon the Account of his Mediation; for Christ is the Mediator, thro' whom all Blessings come from God to his People; therefore he directs his Disciples to ask whatsoever they want in his Name, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3, 14. and 15, 16. and 16.23, 26.

<P><HI>Secondly</HI> In the Description you may observes that the Person in believing puts trust and con∣fidenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in nothing else but Christ for his Justi∣fication. This the holy Apostle disclaims all o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her trust in this Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.8, 9.</P>
<P>But, 3. The Soul in b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lieving, not only rejects all confidences besides Christ, but, the
<PB N="96" REF="004117_0108_1003D0237B2B79E8"/>
positively and really depends upon the Righ∣teousness of Christ, for his reconciliation and Peace with GOD. Justifying faith consists not only of negatives: The true Believer, as he rejects all other dependance, so, he positively, with a sweet Satisfaction of Soul rests on Jesus Christ. By a positive real Act of his Soul he lays hold on him, as the only sure Foundation and Pillar for his sinking Soul to be supported and upheld by: So the Church is represented, <HI>Can.</HI> 8.5. leaning upon her beloved.</P>
<P>That I may more fully open up to you the Nature of <HI>Faith in Christ,</HI> as it is revealed in the holy Scriptures, I shall briefly show you,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st, How it is that a Believer receives Christ, and leans upon his Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly. That this is the Scripture-Doctrine concerning Justifying Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly. The Grounds and Encouragement upon which the Believer, with such Satisfaction leans on Christ, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a adventures his Soul upon him.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>first,</HI> you must consider, the Terms here generally made use of to signifie the Souls acting of Faith on Christ, are not to be under∣stood in a Corporal Sense; as when we conceive of the leaning of one Body upon another. We cannot, in this gross notion, lean or rest on Christ; But the Believer relies upon Christ by
<PB N="97" REF="004117_0109_1003D02786C6A268"/>
the Assent of his Mind, and the free Consent of his Will. In these two Acts of the Soul, is comprised the whole of <HI>saying Faith.</HI> His Assent is nothing else but his firm belief and certain undoubted Perswasion of the Truth of these things which God has revealed in the Gospel, especially concerning his Undone Condition by Sin, and absolute need of a Saviour, and con∣cerning the Way of Recovery and Salvation thro' the Righteousness of Christ only. These great Truths he certainly and firmly believes, with a particular Application to himself, so as to be answerably affected by them; he so believes them as to feel the Power of them upon his Heart, producing those Affections and Disposi∣tions which they have a native tendency to ex∣cite in him, and which the true Belief of them will certainly effect. In this assent is necessarily included a distinct Knowledge, of the Things believed. The blind implicite Faith which the <HI>Papists</HI> Teach as sufficient to Salvation (<HI>viz.</HI> if Persons do but believe as the Church believes, <HI>i. e.</HI> if they believe that the Church believes Right, tho' they don't know one thing distinctly which the Church does believe) is of no value. It is altogether insufficient to sanctifie the Heart, not having the least rational Tendency, as a means, that way: whereas a true Faith purifies the Heart. <HI>Acts</HI> 15, 9. And overcomes the World, 1. <HI>Joh.</HI> 5, 4. Also, it makes the Soul Spiritual and Heavenly, that before was Base and Earthly, led away with the Honours, Pro∣fits

and sordid Pleasures of the World; it breaks the Interest which these Things of the World had in the Heart; but surely a blind Faith, without the Knowledge of Gospel-Truths, can never Effect this; it is by beholding in the Gospel, as in a Glass, the Glory of the Lord, that the Soul is changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord, according to 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3, 18 There can be no true Faith in Christ without a com∣petent Knowledge of the Substance of the Gospel. The Person that believes in Christ, perceives and understands that it is the Report of the Gospel, and as firmly believes it to be God's Truth, that he is a guilty and condemned Creature by the Law of God which he has broken, helpless and undone in himself, that the only way of Relief is thro' the Righteous∣ness of JESUS Christ; there he must come, and have an Interest in it, or perish: He ap∣prehends that Christ has laid no Bar against him in the Gospel, more than others, but of∣fers himself a Saviour to the most Guilty, Wretched and Undone.</P>
<P>And, then, the second and Compleating Act of Faith is the Consent of the Will, whereby the poor and humbled Sinner freely consent, and Chearfully Complies to take Christ for his Saviour; and to lean the whole weight of his guilty Soul and all his Eternal Concerns upon him. The Person, seeing his Condemned Un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one Estate by Sin, is deeply humbled, and made
<PB N="99" REF="004117_0111_1003D031CD813AC8"/>
poor in Spirit, altogether strip'd, and left quite empty of all hopes of Relief from himself: And, seeing the way of Salvation thro' Christ, which is revealed in the Gospel, he heartily closes with it, and, by a sensible lively Act of his Soul receives Christ, and leans upon him for his only Saviour, with a sweet Satisfaction he rolls over himself upon Christ to save him, thro' the Virtue of his Merits and continual Intercession, He is well pleased with this way of Salvation thro' Christ, and lays up all his hopes in him. And this Faith in Christ is not only a transient passing Act, but a settled Habit and abiding Principle in the Soul, which is often, more or less, in a sensible feeling Exercise, in a Believer's Heart; So that <HI>the whole Life which he now lives in the Flesh, he lives by the faith of the Son of God, who loved him and gave himself for him,</HI> Gal. 2.20.</P>
<P>Now this Knowledge of the Truths of Gods Word, which discovers the miserable Undone Condition of the Soul without Christ, and the Way of Salvation thro' his Mediation and Righ∣teousness, with the Powerful Belief of them, and the hearty unfeigned Consent of the Will to this Way of Salvation, whereby the Soul freely quits all other hold, and sweetly rolls it self over on <HI>JESƲS Christ,</HI> is the substance and Sum of Saving Faith. And, by these Actings of the Soul, the Believer truly r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts and leans on the Son of God, and him only for his Eternal Salvation, has his Eyes fixed upon his Media∣tion alone for it, and makes him the ground of

all his Hope, and the Foundation of his Confi∣dence towards God.</P>
<P>From those Things you may see the Reason, why this Grace is so frequently in Scripture expressed by the terms of <HI>Knowing, believing,</HI> and ordinarily by this Name of <HI>Faith,</HI> which properly signifies the <HI>Believing of some Doctrinal Proposition</HI>; and not only by the terms of, <HI>leaning, depending, trusting,</HI> &amp;c. The Reason is, because it consists in a knowing and certain Belief of the Gospel-Revelation of the Way of Salvation thro' Christ's Righteousness, together with the Souls free and affectionate Compliance with it's And in this Faith, the Soul necessarily receives Christ for his Saviour, and rests upon him.</P>
<P>Hence also, you may see, that such as are not firmly perswaded of the Truth of the great Foundation Truths of the Gospel (particularly, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se which I have show'd you, the Soul, in believing, gives its hearty assent to) much more such as positively deny and misbelieve them, have no true Faith in Christ; for it is by the Believing of those that the Soul comes to close wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the Lord JESUS, and to put a sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng Trust and Affiance in him; and without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he cannot, it is impossible.

They are enclined to believe they are true; but yet, for what they know, they may be otherwise. They would
<PB N="101" REF="004117_0113_1003D039B2A4C478"/>
be far from venturing to lay down their Lives upon the Truth of them. It is evident that the Faith of such Persons is nothing else but a doubtful Opinion: whereas the Language of true. Faith is that of the Disciple, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6, 69. <HI>We believe, and are sure.</HI> This is witnessed by all the holy Martyrs of JESUS, who have laid down their Lives for the Truths of the Gospel; <HI>who were slain for the Word of God, and for the Testimony which they held,</HI> Rev. 6.9. O Sirs, here is the great danger and m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>schief of Ignorance in the Understanding, of Unfixedness and Er∣ror in the Judgment; that they keep the Soul from Union with Christ, and dishonour GOD, <HI>For he that believeth not, God hath made him a Liar▪ Because he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son.

<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> Having thus far opened the Nature of Saving Faith, I am next to show you, that this is the true Notion of it taught in the holy Scriptures; that this is the Faith which GOD requires in his Word.

Word, then, sure, they are to be believed; and it is as certain, that the Person who truly believes them, in so doing, must necessarily acknowledge, and be sensible of his most Miserable Undone State by Sin, renounce all Confidence in his own Righteousness, all trust in himself or any thing that he can do, and put his whole Trust in Christ alone, his whole dependance upon his Righteousness; for any other Trust and Depen∣dance in this Case would be both contrary to the Doctrines of the Gospel, and inconsistent with the real Belief of them. Thus, the Lord offering Christ to Sinners, in the Gospel, as their only Saviour, certainly he requires them to receive him as such; and this, when it is done really, freely and affectionately, is the Faith which I have described. So that these Doctri∣nes taught in God's Word, sufficiently discover the Nature of a true Faith in Christ. But,</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> The Scriptures hold forth the Nature of Faith by such expressions as, necessarily and clearly determine it to this believing De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en∣dance upon Christs Righteousness▪ <HI>Rom.</HI> 3, 24 25. <HI>Being justified freely by his Gracy thro' the redemption that is in Jesus Christ; whom God hath set forth to be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ropitation, thro' faith in his Blood.</HI> Far him his Blood, here plainly signifies a Dependance upon his Death and Sufferings, as the only price of or Redemption and Peace with God, as that thro' which only, a condemned Sinner must be Justified; and ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntend nothing else.

<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> And now, to conclude this head of the Nature of Fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, I shall endeavour to show you, how a Person comes to put such Trust in the
<PB N="104" REF="004117_0116_1003B3E1771AE730"/>
Lord JESUS; upon what Ground and Encou∣ragement he leans on Christ with such Satis∣faction and Peace; so as, Rejecting all other Dependance, to adventure his guilty Soul wholly upon him. And in the first Place, <HI>Negatively,</HI> you must consider, that he takes not his Encou∣ragement from the Consideration of any peculiar Privileges, or Personal Righteousness of his own, thinking thereby to recommend himself to Christ, or render himself any way worthy of his Righteousness; for this is but a more plausi∣ble way of seeking Justification by Works, by our own Righteousness; and laying the Foun∣dation of it upon something in our selves, and not entirely upon Christ.</P>
<P>But, in the next Place <HI>Affirmatively,</HI> The Progress of Faith in Christ is much according to these several Steps, 1st. The Soul sees that he is brought into a Miserable and condemned State by Sin: That he is a most undone Crea∣ture forever, unless he can find some way of Relief, wherein he shall obtain a full Removal of his awful Guilt, and total Discharge of his Obligation to Punishing and vindictive Justice, 2<HI>dly.</HI> He sees and is sure that there is no other way of Relief for him but thro' the Mediation and Righteousness of the Redeemer Christ; according to the Scripture, and these places in particular, among others, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14.6. <HI>Acts.</HI> 4.12. <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.20 to 26. And 3<HI>dly,</HI> He conceives a strong Probability, at least of Relief this way, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r himself in particular; a probability of Peace with God, and e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>caping his Wrath
<PB N="105" REF="004117_0117_1003D04D992A13E0"/>
thro' Christs Righteousness; That GOD will receive him to his Love and Mercy, Poor, Wretched and Hell-deserving as he is, in his beloved Son. And this Encouragement, and Ground of Trust in Christ he takes, not from a conceit of any Worthiness in himself or his own Doings (as I have but now said) which will Recommend him to his Acceptance; But, from the All-sufficiency and Fullness which he discovers in Christ himself, and the free Offers of him in the Gospel. He sees that Christ is an All sufficient Saviour, able to save them to the utmost that come unto God by him; seeing he has offered himself for sin, a Sacrifice of infinite Value; and poured out his Soul unto Death; and not only so, but, has risen again from the Dead, and ascended up into Glory, sits at the Right Hand of the Majesty on High, and now <HI>ever liveth to make Intercession for them.</HI> He discovers likewise that Christ is fully and freely offered in the Gospel, as a Saviour; to the most Unworthy and Hell-deserving. As, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55 1. <HI>Ho, every one that Thirsteth, come ye to the Waters, and he that hath no Money; come ye buy and eat, yea, come, buy Wine and Milk without Money and without Price,</HI> Matt. 11, 28. <HI>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy lader, and I will give you Rest.</HI> Now, sure, here is En∣couragement enough for the convinced Sinner to receive Christ; and a sufficient Foundation for his Trust in him And thus, the poor humbled Soul seeing that he is Miserable and
<PB N="106" REF="004117_0118_1003D0500AB827E8"/>
Undone by Sin, and that there is no other way of Relief or Help for him, and a high Probabi∣lity, at least, this way, considering the Suffi∣ciency of the Redeemer, and the Freeness of his Offer; He lets go all other Dependance, and Resolves to venture himself entirely upon the Lord JESUS; to him he will cleave, and will not let him go; for there is none else that can help him; like a Man among the devouring Waves in the open Ocean that lays fast hold upon a single Plank that's by him, with which he will not part, utterly dispairing of help any other way. The Case of the Soul in believing, sometimes, is much like that of the four Lepers at the Gate of <HI>Samaria,</HI> when the City suffered a Seige from the Enemy without, and a cruel Famine within, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 57.3.4. <HI>There were four Leprous Men at the entring in of the Gate; And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey said one to another, Why sit we here until we die? If we say we will enter into the City, then the Famine is in the City, and we shall die there: And if we sit still here, we die also: Now therefore, come, and let us fall unto the Host of the</HI> Syrians, <HI>if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, We shall but die.</HI> These Men in their Extremity had some Proba∣bility of help from the <HI>Syrians</HI> in their view, but quite gave up all hope any other Way; the truly humbled S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nner sees himself in the same strait; but he has much more Ground offered him in the Gospel to trust in Christ for his Relief than these men had to confide in the <HI>Syrian</HI> Army; he considers, like them, that if he sits still where
<PB N="107" REF="004117_0119_1003D05270E26398"/>
he is, he shall die; if he continues in that con∣demned State in which he is without Christ, he shall surely die; and if he goes any where else but to Christ, he shall die there; If he trusts to his own Righteousness, depends upon his Per∣sonal Obedience and Reformation, that cannot save him, but he shall die there also. Thus being reduced to the greatest Extremity, and upholding the Glorious Encouragement opened in the Gospel of Relief and Help in Jesus Christ, he joyfully lays hold on him for his Saviour, and there he rests his weary Soul. And this is saving Faith, called, the <HI>Faith of Adherence</HI> or <HI>Dependance only,</HI> being short of a bright and full Assurance; yet it has very precious and sweet Effects: It causes the Soul to dart out the beams of a pure and transcendant Love to the Glorious God: It Introduces a sweet Joy into the Soul, and brings a balmy Peace to the wounded Conscience, in proportion to the degree of Faith and Trust which the Soul re∣poses in Jesus Christ. I pray you to compare these things with the experiences of your own Souls, as I pass along, and examine whether ever you have so received Christ. <HI>O Sirs</HI>! It is much to be truly sensible of your utter Undone∣ness without Christ, and absolute need of him, that nothing else can help the condemned Sin∣ner: Without a sense of this, it is impossible to come to Christ; the Soul is not a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all in the way to believe in him. Although a Conviction of a Sinners Misery, and the deepest Poverty of Spi∣rit
<PB N="108" REF="004117_0120_1003B3E794CE4F28"/>
renders the Sinner no way more worthy of Christ, yet it's necessary to put the Soul in the way to close with Christ, and believe in him. It's necessary in order to the acting of Faith upon him. But to proceed,</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> There is yet a higher degree of Faith, a more f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll and sweet recumbency on the Lord Jesus, that more effectually frees the Soul from anxious Fear and Mistrust, which a Believer may advance to, and for which he has answerable Ground and Encouragement from God. The GOD of Truth, who cannot deceive, has po∣sitively promised, that whosoever comes to Christ in this manner, and leans his guilty Soul wholly upon him, be he never so Vile. Poor and Unworthy, shall be accepted in him. What a blessed Assurance is that which Christ himself, the Lord of life gives, <HI>Joh.</HI> 6.37. <HI>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> And <HI>v.</HI> 40. He assures us, that it is the Fathers Will and Pleasure, that such as so believe in him, should be eternally saved. <HI>And this,</HI> says he, <HI>is the Will of him that sent me, that every one which hath the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting Life, and I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll raise him up at the last Day.</HI> What a sweet Word is that to a Believer, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.6. <HI>Behold, I lay in Zion a Chief Corner-Stone, elect, precious; And hê that believeth-on him shall not be confounded.</HI> Now when the poor and humble Soul disc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> this, he receives Christ, and leans
<PB N="109" REF="004117_0121_1003D0544E803820"/>
upon him with the greater Confidence, for he has the sure Word of God for his Warrant, the Infallible Promise of <HI>Jehovah</HI> for the Foun∣dation of his Faith, When he has a sight of this Security for his Acceptance in Christ, and the Acting of his Faith in Christ thereupon, is so full and sensible as to be clear to his own View, then it is the Faith of Assurance, and he is as sure that GOD is reconciled to him in Christ, as that there is a God, or that himself lives upon the Earth.</P>
<P>Thus, I have laid before you the Nature of a true and saving Faith: and from what has been said upon it, you may conceive how humble, low and base in his own sight a true Believer is: How deeply sensible of his Wretchedness and Poverty in himself. Hence you may see what a strong and unspeakable Love must needs fill his Heart to the Gracious God, who has pro∣vided such a Remedy for so undone and vile a Creature. O Sirs, his Heart within him burns with the purest Love to the Dîvine Majesty: How exceeding dear is Christ to his Soul! well might the Apostle say, <HI>To you that believe he is precious,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.7. Christ is to him as <HI>the Apple Tree among the Trees of the Wood</HI>: His very Name is as <HI>Ointment poured forth, Cant.</HI> 3.4. What a sweet Peace and Satisfaction possesses his Soul in leaning upon his Saviour! In a Word, how freely and fully does he give up himself to Christ, to serve him while he lives to be for him, and none else forever. And now,</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="004117_0122_1003D05607F51818"/>2<HI>dly.</HI> I proceed to show you the necessity of faith in Christ, in order to Justification thro' his Righteousness. That it is indispensibly neces∣sary to this End, is beyond dispute with all that understand and believe the Scriptures. But I am to consider upon what account it is so necessary: what is the concern which it has in the Justifi∣cation of a Sinner, upon the account of which he cannot be justified without it. Here then you must know that Faith is not concerned in Justification, as a Qualification that is any Way meritorious of it: Nothing has any Hand or part in Justification, as a Merit or Price, but the Righteousness of the Lord JESUS, as I have sufficiently made arpear, which is so full and sufficient that nothing else is necessary this way. To Christ belongs the whole honour and praise of the Purchase of Salvation. But Faith is concerned in Justification, as the Hand or In∣strument which receives the Righteousness of Christ, and applies it to the Soul, according to the wise Constitution and Appointment of God in the Gospel. Upon this account it is so ne∣cessary to Justification. By Faith the Soul lays hold on Christ for its Saviour; and as the Belie∣ver receives Christ and depends upon his Righ∣teousness, the Lord then imputes his Righ∣teousness him; that is, he receives it for him, and accepts him upon the account of it, as fully as if he had produced a Righteousness sufficient of his own. The Lord now looks upon it as the Believer's Righ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eousness, he having laid
<PB N="111" REF="004117_0123_1003D05B971D9E28"/>
hold upon it, as his only Justifying Righteous∣ness, and put all his hopes in it, This is the Way which the Lord, has appointed, for the Sinner's interest in Christ's Justifying Righte∣ousness, <HI>viz.</HI> By his receiving and laying hold upon it by Faith: so that as soon may a Man be saved from drowning by a Plank in the Wa∣ter without laying hold upon it, as soon may a Begger be enriched by an Alms offered him, without putting forth his Hand to receive it, as a Person can be Justified by Christ, without receiving him by Faith. And indeed, it can∣not in reason be expected that any should be benefited by the Gospel-Method of Grace and Salvation without their hearty Compliance with it: The Lord will save none in any way against their Wills; and none do consent and agree to this Way of Salvation thro' Christ, which God has appointed, until they embrace Christ, and close with him by Faith, but are still for being saved some other Way▪ But, <HI>O Sirs,</HI> there is no other Way in which you can be saved; and therefore, if you agree not unfeignedly to this, you are eternally Undone. And so I pass on to the</P>
<P><HI>Third</HI> General Head proposed, which was, to lay before you something of the Glory and Excellency of this Method which God has esta∣blished for the Justification of a condemned Sinner: it consists you see of two parts: of <HI>Merit</HI> and <HI>Purchase</HI> upon Christs part and Faith in the same, on our part. I shall a little con∣sider
<PB N="112" REF="004117_0124_1003CFF80431B330"/>
the beauty of it in both these respects.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Then, as to the <HI>Meritorious cause of Ju∣stification, the Obedience and Suffering of the Son of God</HI>: This is certainly a Scheme every way worthy of God to project for the Recovery of a Fallen and Condemned Creature; for in it his adorable Perfections receive a very Glorious Display. How glorious does his infinite Wis∣dom appear in it! The Law of God, or the first Covenant Treaty of God with Man, requires a perfect Obedience in all things, and at all times, as the Condition of Eternal Life; Thie Con∣dition must be fulfilled; o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Eternal Life can∣not be obtained; but Mankind has here uni∣versally come short, and so is condemned to a privative Misery, the loss of Glory and Hap∣piness forever. And as upon consideration of the bare non-performance of the Condition of Life, Man is shut out of Heaven, and deprived of a a glorious Immortality by this first Covenant; so, upon consideration of his transgressing the Law of GOD, he is by the Law, according to the tenor of this Covenant, condemned to that positive Punishment which his Sin deserves, which is very dreadful and unspeakable, and which must be sustained. Now Man is utterly incapable to answer these Demands of the Law for his Recovery; and there is no other Creature able to answer the Law for him, nor willing to undertake it: Which Way then shall the Law be answered, and yet the Sinner relieved? He can not answer it himself any other Way
<PB N="113" REF="004117_0125_1003D05D1DC619D0"/>
than by suffering Eternally: And supposing he could in a limited duration bear all that positive Punishment which the Law doomed him to, for his Sin, yet he could have no access to the glorious everlasting Enjoyment of GOD; because he had failed in his Obedience, and not fulfilled the Condition upon which this happi∣ness was promised: O then how shall both the Law be answered, and the poor Sinner saved! Would not this one Question have put the whole Creation to silence? and eternally Non-plus'd the highest reach of Creature-Thought? The Resolution of it exceeds the utmost bounds of all Creature-Invention. It would appear utterly impossible that the Law could be answered any other way than by the Sinners falling a Sacrifice to vindictive Justice. But, <HI>O Sirs,</HI> behold and admire the astonishing Wisdom of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> whereby he has made foolish the Wisdom of the World: The Second Person in the glorious Godhead, the eternal Son of God, who is God equal with the Father, takes upon him our Nature, a human body and Soul into a Personal Union with himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and thereby becomes capable of fulfilling the Law which Sinners had broken, and bearing its awful Penalty; and the infinite Dignity of his Person adds an infinite Value to his Mediation; So that the Law is fully answered in the utmost of its Demands, and a door of Hope opened for Guilty and Wretched Creatures. Oh, Asto∣nishing Mystery! <HI>Without controversy great is the

Such Wisdom as astonishes all the Saints on Earth, and all the Hosts in Heaven: Infinite Wisdom shines all round the Contrivance, such as strikes us with Astonish∣ment and Wonder to behold. What a strange Method has God proposed to answer the Law and save the condemned Sinner, by the Union of God and Man in one Person; so that <HI>Wonder∣ful,</HI> is justly put as the first part of our <HI>Immanuel's</HI> Name. <HI>Isa.</HI> 9.6. How difficult, and even, to a created understanding, impossible was the disco∣very of any Method sufficient for the Compas∣sing of this great End; But it was no difficulty with God, he has found a Ransom; And how fit and sufficient is the Mean proposed for the obtaining of the End designed. Again, the unspotted Holiness and inflexible Justice of God are clearly manifested in this Method of Salvation: Therein he has testified the dreadful desert of Sin, and his infinite Abhorrence of it; rather than it should go unpunished, he would punish it in his own dear Son; &amp; so he has main∣tained the Honour and awful Respect due to his Royal Law. But, in the last Place, how gloriously is the infinite Love of GOD, the Riches of his Grace and Compassion declared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> O admirable Love, that God should give

his own Well-beloved Son a Sacrifice for Hell-deserving Sinners! that the Son of God should stoop so low to save Rebellious Worms! O <HI>Sirs</HI>! How does this thought endear God to his Peo∣ple, and enflame their Hearts with a returning love to him: So that by this Method of Salva∣tion God eminently displays his sweetest Glory to his People, highly endears himself unto their Hearts, and advances their Happiness and Delight in Heaven, even above the Angels, who have only to sing, the Praises of creating Goodness, but they shall also sing the Praises of Redeeming Love to the Father, Son and holy Ghost for∣ever while they behold the Lamb that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain in the midst of the Throne of God. How dreadfully then do they err, to the dishonour of God and the ruin of their own Souls, who, from a conceit of raising Religion to a very sublime heîght of Spiritualness, look upon a crucified Jesus as too mean and carnal a thing to be the Object of a Believers Faith, or to have his Heart much influenced and affected by: This is Spirituality, indeed, so to undervalue and despise the most glorious Expression of the divine Perfections that ever the World was acquainted with; the most beautiful Scene that ever was opened to the view of God's Rational Creation; such is the Method of Redemption thro' a crucified Saviour; and such as are truly spiritually enlightened, see it so: tho' <HI>Christ Cru∣cificed be to others Foolishness, to them he is the Power of GOD and the Wisdom of God,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.6. <HI>God

who commanded the Light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of JESUS CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>And then 2<HI>dly,</HI> As to Faith, the Instru∣mental Cause of Justification: The <HI>Gos∣pel Method</HI> of Salvation appears amiable and beautiful in that <HI>Faith</HI> in Christ is therein made of indispensible Necessity for the Application of his Righteousness to the Soul: for is it not very becoming a Guilty and vile Creature, deserving of God's Wrath, that he should be sensible to whom he is beholden for his Salva∣tion, especially when it has been purchas∣ed for him at so dear a Rate; and so, that he should give the whole Glory and Praise to the Author of it, and take to himself Shame and Confusion of Face? Is it not reasonable that the Lord JESUS should have the whole Glory of redemp∣tion given to him by his redeemed Ones? Now these Things are only provided for by this appointment of Faith: without Faith Christ should not have the just Honours of his Mediation paid to him; the Unbeliever robs him of them. And then again, By this Constitution of the necessity
<PB N="117" REF="004117_0129_1003B3F1FAEF4BA8"/>
of Faith, there is Provision made for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Sanctification and Holiness of those who are Justified by Christ▪ had there been no Provision made this way in the Gospel-Method of Justification, had Provision only been made for the Salvation of Sin∣ners from the punishment of Hell and not also from the Power and Dominion of Sin, this, had been a Stain and Ble∣mish in it, and matr'd all it's Beauty: But Faith in Christ has a powerful in∣fluence upon holiness of Life; as evi∣dently appears from its very Nature, as I have before explain'd it to you; for Faith endears Christ to the Soul, and fills it with the purest Love to his Ma∣jesty; It works by love, as the Apostle tells us, (<HI>Gal.</HI> 5.6.) and Love works by Obedience; a Person that truly loves Christ, delights to honour and Please him, by obeying his Commands, and therefore himself tells us, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14 23. <HI>If a man loves me, he will keep my Words.</HI> A total Rejecting of all Dependance upon our Obedience, and depending intirely upon Christ, is the surest Foundation of Obedience, and the only Principle from whence a pure Obedience flows: GOD
<PB N="118" REF="004117_0130_1003D065405FDEF8"/>
regards not that Mercenary Obedience which blind Sinners perform from a legal Principle, thinking by their faithless, graceless Services to recommend them∣selves to the Acceptance of the holy God: When Obedience, I say, flows from this Spring, it is no true Obedience to God; He detests and abhors it; that is only pleasing in his sight which proceeds from a pure love kindled by the Grace of Faith.</P>

<P>ANd now, <HI>My Hearers,</HI> I entreat you to examine your selves whether you have true Faith in Christ or not; You have heard the absolute Necessity of it, that without it you never can be saved; and you have heard the Nature of it laid open. Now then, I beseech you to search your own Souls, whether you are true Believers in Christ. Have you ever been thoroughly convinced of your Guil∣ty and Condemned State by Sin, so as to be deeply distressed upon the account of it, and seek in earnest what you should do
<PB N="118" REF="004117_0131_1003B3F69E7593B0"/>
to be saved? And have you fled to Christ alone for your Relief? Rejected all De∣pendance upon any thing else, and laid hold on the Lord JESUS for your Souls Salvation, depending on him alone for it, thro' the virtue of his Merits and Me∣diation-Works; Have you received him by such a Faith as makes him exceeding dear and precious to your Hearts, dearer to you than your own Lives, so that it is the unfeigned and fervent Desire and En∣deavour of your Souls to serve him in all his Ways, and obey him in all his Laws? Such of you, as have so closed with JESUS Christ have great Ground of Comfort, for he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting Life. But you who have not so received Christ, are yet in your <HI>Condemned State</HI>; This Moment you are under the Wrath of GOD: All your numberless Sins stand in force against you Unforgiven; Not one of them is pardoned: Divine Justice is every Day ready to take Vengeance on your guilty Heads: There is nothing stands between you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd its dismal Strokes, but the mere Long-suffering and Forbearance of the Gracious God, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch will be wron out
<PB N="119" REF="004117_0132_1003D066C6E3BBA0"/>
in a little time, and then shall the Sword of his Justice be bathed in the Blood of your Souls forever, and you shall feel what a dreadful thing it was, that you did not come to Christ. <HI>He that believeth not,</HI> says Christ, <HI>shall be Damned.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> You that believe in Jesus Christ Let me entreat you, dear brethren, to be much in the exercise of this precious Grace of Faith; that you may say with the Apostle, The Life which I now live in the Flesh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God. This is the Way to honour God, and to get Comfort to your own Souls. You should be frequently looking by Faith to JESUS the Captain of your Salvation, and leaning your Souls upon him, you should endeavour to strengthen your Faith by considering, that he that believeth on him shall not be con∣founded: He is an able and All-sufficient Saviour, able <HI>to save them to the utmost that come unto God by him; seeing he ever liveth to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke Intercession for them,</HI> Heb. 72.5.</P>
<P>And you who have never recei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Christ by Faith, I call to you from the great God, now to hasten to the Lord
<PB N="120" REF="004117_0133_1003D0686F24DCE8"/>
JESUS: If you come not to him, you are eternally Undone. There are two things which are the greatest hindrances in the way of Sinners coming to Christ; <HI>first,</HI> An insensibleness of their extreme Need of him: they don't see that Wretch∣ed Condition which they are in without him: they will not be convinced of it; and therefore they sit still at ease, and will not come to Christ for Relief, while they are not aware of their Misery. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> When they are in some measure sensible of their undone Condition, they are often seeking Relief in a wrong Method, depending upon their great <HI>Reformation,</HI> their Repentance and Obedience for it; there they take Sanctuary for themselves, short of Christ: Now I have endeavoured to remove these two undoing Evils which keep the Soul from Christ: I have shown you that Condemned wretched State which sin has brought you into, and the only way of recovery out of it, thro' JESUS Christ; And what can I do more? I beseech you to consider these things, and lay them solemnly to heart: I call Heaven and Earth to witness against you this Day, that I have shown you that
<PB N="121" REF="004117_0134_1003B3F94A02D5F0"/>
Way of Layife: and will you yet be stupid and secure! Are you resolved to Perish in your Sins! May the LORD, the high and holy GOD follow with his powerful Blessing what has been spoken▪ to your true Conversion to Christ, that your Souls may be saved in the Day of the LORD JESUS, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
