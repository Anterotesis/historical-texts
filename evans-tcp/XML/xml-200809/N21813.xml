<HEAD>To the Yearly Meeting now sitting.</HEAD>
<P>The committee appointed on the interesting concern for pro∣moting the welfare of the Indian Natives—Report, that at se∣veral meetings in which we have had the company of divers concerned brethren not particularly named to the service; we have deliberately considered this important subject, which hath for a series of years deeply exercised the minds of many friends, and been latterly revived in the yearly meeting with increasing weight—Our minds have been measurably drawn into sympathy with these distressed inhabitants of the wilderness, and on comparing their situation with our own, and calling to grateful remembrance the kindness of their predecessors to ours in the early settlement of this country; considering also our professed principles of peace and goodwill to men, we were in-induced with much unanimity to believe, that there are loud calls for our benevolence and charitable exertions to promote amongst them the principles of the Christian religion, as well as to turn their attention to school learning, agriculture, and useful me∣chanic employments, especially as there appears in some of the tribes, a willingness to unite in the exercise of endeavours of this kind—We believe that this end may be much promoted under the Divine Blessing, by a recommendation from this meeting to the several quarterly meetings, that a liberal subscription be set on foot and a fund raised, to be under the direction of a special committee to be appointed by the yearly meeting, in order that these pious purposes may be carried into effect as ear∣ly as practicable, and the apparent friendly disposition of go∣vernment towards this desirable object improved.—And con∣ceiving that this subject is of sufficient magnitude to claim the at∣tention of our religious society in different parts of this conti∣nent, we think it may be useful to hint the substance of this concern in the Epistles to the respective yearly meetings.</P>

<HEAD>At a meeting of the said Committee in Philadelphia, on the <HI>3</HI>rd of the <HI>11</HI>th Month <HI>1795,</HI> the fol∣lowing Epistle was directed to the Quarterly and Monthly Meetings belonging to the said Yearly Meeting.</HEAD>
<P>The committee appointed by the yearly meeting to attend to the growing concern for the welfare of our Indian Brethren, have seriously considered the important trust devolved upon them, the prosecution of which will evidently require prudence, patience and perseverance, its ultimate object, under the Di∣vine Blessing being no less than the temporal and spiritual welfare of some thousands of our fellow men, and their posterity.</P>
<P>Difficulties however should not discourage us from the exercise of our christian duty toward these people, when we call to mind that they were the original inhabitants of this land, and that they kindly received and made room for our forefathers, when <HI>they</HI> were strangers in it; especially as <HI>we</HI> are settled upon the sea coasts, and parts adjacent, enjoying, through the bounty of Providence, an abundance of temporal blessings, where <HI>they</HI> once lived in ease and plenty, but are <HI>now</HI> wandering from hill to hill, scarcely able to find subsistence in their former way of life—Circumstances which loudly call for our brotherly assist∣ance▪ to put them in a way to support themselves by Agricul∣ture and handicrafts.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="028715_0005_0FD9BCA81063E470"/>It is hoped that some sober well qualified friends will be drawn to unite with the Concern so far as to go among them for the pur∣pose of instructing them in husbandry, and useful trades; and teaching their children necessary learning, that they may be ac∣quainted with the Scriptures of truth, improve in the principles of Christianity, and become qualified to manage temporal concerns— and it is expected that the committee will find it expedient to erect Grist and Saw Mills, Smith's shops and other necessary im∣provements in some of their villages. For the support of those who may be disposed to undertake the performance of these services, due provision is intended to be made; and any proposals from concerned friends will be received by Thomas Wistar of Phila∣delphia our clerk, and laid before the committee for consideration.</P>
<P>The present appears to us a favourable period for carrying on this good work—the boundaries of some of the tribes are fixed by treaty—their lands cannot now be so easily alienated as hereto∣fore, and evil communication with traders and others is intended to be prevented by Government, whose consent and approbation of the measures proposed has been already expressed.</P>
<P>We have appointed John Elliott our treasurer, who is to re∣ceive the collections that may be made in the several monthly meetings for these benevolent purposes.</P>
<P>To spread before friends some information of the present opening for usefulness, the following speeches of some of their chiefs, and extracts of letters from others who have been taught to read and write, are selected from a considerable number which speak the same language, from different tribes.</P>

<P>We are glad, and rejoice in our hearts, to see our brothers the Quakers speaking before us. We feel the grace that is in

your hearts conveyed to us, and wish to be of the same reli∣gion; but we are poor, and weak, and not capable of judging for ourselves: we hope you will have pity upon us, and instruct us how to gain a comfortable livelihood, and also how we may come to obtain everlasting happiness. When we think of our poor children our hearts are affected with sorrow: we hope you will send us teachers.</P>

<HEAD>The Speech of Gayashuta an ancient Chief of the Senneca nation on the borders of Pennsylvania as given in charge by him to one of the Sachems of that Nation, in the Year <HI>1790,</HI> to be deli∣vered to the Friends of Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Brothers, the sons of my beloved brother Onas,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Onas is the Inidian word for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quill, and by that name they speak of William Penn.</NOTE></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>When I was young and strong our country was full of game, which the good Spirit sent for us to live upon; the lands which belonged to us were extended far beyond where we hunted; I and the people of my nation had enough to eat, and always something to give to our friends when they entered our cab∣bins; and we rejoiced when they received it from us: hunting was then not tiresome, it was diversion, it was a pleasure.</P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>When your fathers asked land from my nation; we gave it to them, for we had more than enough: Gayashuta was amongst the first of the people to say, "Give land to our brother Onas, for he wants it," and he has always been a friend to Onas, and to his children.</P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>Your fathers saw Gayashuta when he was young; when he had not even thought of old age or weakness: but you are too far off to see him, now he is grown old. He is very old and feeble and he wonders at his own shadow it is become so little. He has no children to take care of him, and the game is driven away by the white people, so that the young men must hunt all day long to find game for themselves to eat; they have nothing left for Gayashuta. And it is not Gayashuta only, who is become old and feeble, there yet re∣main about thirty men of your old friends, who, unable to
<PB N="8" REF="028715_0007_0FD9BCB3886C43E8"/>
provide for themselves, or to help one another, are become poor, and are hungry and naked.</P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>Gayashuta sends you a belt which he received long ago from <HI>your fathers,</HI> and a writing which he received but as yesterday, from one of <HI>you.</HI> By these you will remember him and the old friends of your fathers in this nation: look on this belt and this writing, and if you remember the old friends of <HI>your fathers</HI> consider their former friendship and their pre∣sent distress; and if the good Spirit shall put it into your hearts, to comfort them in their old age, do not disregard his coun∣sel.—We are men, and therefore, need only tell you, that we are old and feeble and hungry and naked; and that we have no other friends but you, the children of our beloved brother Onas.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Brothers,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The Senneca nation see that the Great Spirit intends they should not continue to live by hunting, and they look round on every side and enquire who it is that shall teach them what is best for them to do.</P>
<P>Your fathers dealt honestly with our fathers, they have en∣gaged us to remember it, and we wish our children to be taught the same principles by which your fathers were guided.</P>
<P><HI>Brothers,</HI></P>
<P>We have too little wisdom among us, we cannot teach our children what we perceive their situation requires them to know. We wish them to be instructed to read and write and such other things as you teach your children, especially the love of peace.</P>

that instead of depending upon the using guns for our sup∣port we take hold the ax, hoe, plow, scythe and sickle, that our children after us may become good farmers, and above all, number of us both male and female are come to resolu∣tion to wait upon the great good Spirit who will lead us in the way of everlasting life—and I hope that number of my friends have experienced in measure the love of Christ who died for chief of sinners.—And we have sent our children to school every day to learn to read the word of God and other good books— and endeavour to impress the things in their minds which are profitable for body and soul.</P>
<P>My good friend, I have just inform you our situation; we have build a house above one year ago, about thirty feet square, to be use as school house and a house where we met on Lords day to wait upon God, and here is some inconvenience in the time of cold weather without fire to warm the house, and in considering this I come to conclude to querie with you as friend whether you would be so kind as to help us or speak or use your influence among your brethren and friends in your society, to help us to keep this house warm—That our poor children may be warmed in the time of school, and our poor people may not catch the cold in the time of waiting and worshipping God in this house. If you would then my petition is to you and your Friends, to put stove in this house and we will put fire on it, then the house will be warm without getting great deal of wood. And I believe it will be agreeable to the Father of all mercies.</P>

<P>My friend, I feel happy to hear your kind and friendly words; that you had a concern for your poor Indian friends and that you would help them both in body and soul. And the token of which you have signified that you would send some books or implements of husbandry to such place as it would be best. My friend this is most acceptable offer, and I am re∣quested by my people to desire you to send some implements of husbandry to fort Schuyler on Mohawk river to John Posts, who would take care of the same until we fetch them. The hoes are most wanting among us, also two or three plows, chain and scythes, and axes, and harrow tooth—these articles are very scarce here in wilderness—if we could get such we can then go on with our spring work. Respecting books—spelling books and primmers are necessary—for there are about forty small children
<PB N="10" REF="028715_0009_0FD9BCB6AD632400"/>
who would use the small books—but the big children have got some books to read from other quarter.</P>
<P>My friend, I will acquaint you that we attempted to build saw-mill this summer and have got all the irons ready—we in∣tended begin to work next month but money being so scarce we could not purchase some necessaries on that work.</P>
<P>My friends have thought that if we could hire fifty dollars from our friends we could make out—and they desire me to mention it to you—My friend I only mention this to you that you may know our situation—and if you find it you could lent us so much without harm to your minds, we will replaced next winter, there is annual sum come in to this nation out of which we can replace your money.—</P>
<P>My People and Friends does very well this spring in their attempts to learn to be Farmers.—</P>
<P>One of my Boys has been sick and died three weeks ago— he was eight years of age—one week before he expired I ask him several questions—Among other things I ask him whether he could trust our Saviour Jesus—he said "Yes I have often pray to him in my heart."</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>By the dispensation of Providence I and my family are well. And also I would inform you that by the help of good Spirit I have been under concern for my poor and never dying soul as to take a full resolution to forsake the service of the evil one. And by the help of God I endeavour to walk in newness of life in my remnant days. I was first convinced when I hear you preaching at Canadarquay, discoursing upon talents that however a small talent man may have, yet he is required to improve it, on these expressions I could not contain myself, being convicted that I am the one who bury my master's money. And just before your departure, one of your friends came to bid us farewell, he spake and advised me that I should al∣ways endeavour to follow soberness, by this I may obtain God's blessing, then I was encouraged to begin to do my duty as the Lord giveth me light.</P>
