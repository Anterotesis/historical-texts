<P>Capt. <HI>John Gyles,</HI> Capt. <HI>Samuel Jordan,</HI> Mr. <HI>Joseph Bane,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Abraham Johnson</HI> Interpreters of the Indian Language, were sworn to the faithful Performance of that Service.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Governour,</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>My good Friends and Brethren,</HI> I give praise to GOD the great Governour of the World, that He has brought us together at this Time to see one another in Health and Safety.</P>
<P>I now meet you with sincere Joy and Satisfaction to renew and establish the Peace and Friendship that has been made between us.</P>
<P>I am now come at the Desire of the Chiefs of the Tribes to hear what they have to offer to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toxus,</SPEAKER>
<P>It is GOD who has the over ruling Power over all things, that has brought us together at this Time.</P>
<P>The Reason of our coming now is our hearty desire of Love and Friendship.</P>
<P>The Reason of our coming in so great a Number is to see your Excellency; and it is the Will of GOD to give us an Opportu∣nity to wait on you.</P>
<P>As a Token of our being glad to see your Excellency, I shake Hands, and offer this as our Money. <STAGE>(Laid down some Furs.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arexis,</SPEAKER>
<P>We have heard what your Excellency has offer'd us, and we rejoice from our Hearts.</P>
<P>It is the greatest Motive to Friendship and Love, that we should openly see one another.</P>
<P>It is the ordering of Providence that we have now the Oppor∣tunity of seeing one another.</P>
<P>As your Excellency sees me, it is all one as if our Chief had waited on you; and this is a Pledge of it. <STAGE>(Laid down some Furs.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Penobscot</HI> Men told me when they first came to see me, that it was a busy Time, and therefore there could not come any more of them to this Place; I shall therefore be ready to give you all the Dispatch that you desire, that so you may re∣turn to your Homes as soon as you shall think fit; and I shall 
<PB N="3" REF="003554_0003_0FF85F78DE894A90"/>
give you a Signal when you shall see me here again. I would not hurry you into any thing, for I am glad of your Company: But I shall be ready to hear what you have to say when you are ready, that so you mayn't be detain'd longer than you desire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arexis.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are not in haste, but desire longer Time to discourse with your Excellency.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire you may consider of every thing that may tend to lengthen out the Peace and Tranquility between us.</P>
<P>Whenever you have a mind to speak with the Governour, if you will send to me, I will give the Signal to call the Tribes to∣gether, which will be the Firing a Gun from the Man of War, and hoisting the King's Jack on the Main Top-Mast-Head.</P>
<P>I will give you King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Colours to be carried in the Head of such Canooe as you shall agree on in Token of your Subjection to His Majesty; It is such a Flag as I carry in my own Boat</P>
</SP>
<P>A Motion being made by the Indians that a Doctor should be ordered to look after one of their People that was Sick; The Governour directed Dr. <HI>Noyes</HI> to take Care of him; and acquain∣ted them, that if any other of them were Sick, they should be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well taken Care of as himself, if he were Sick.</P>
<P>And the Indians then took their Leave.</P>

Upon which His Excellency sent a Message to them to signify his Displeasure on this Occasion, and to let them know, that he would not see them To Day, and to order their immediate Return, and to give them a strict Charge to come over at all Times with the <HI>English</HI> Colours, and not presume to wear the <HI>French.</HI> Whereupon they returned to their Camp at <HI>Hog-Island.</HI></P>

<P>I am glad that you are arrived safe and in Health. <HI>(To the Chief of the</HI> Penobscut <HI>Tribe, and others lately arrived.)</HI></P>
<P>I hope GOD smiles upon this Interview, since he orders his Sun to shine gloriously upon us, which I trust is a happy Presage of the good Success of this Affair.</P>
<P>When I saw you last, I told you that I was ready to hear what you had to offer to me, and that I should be glad to join with you in every thing that tends to a happy Peace.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, As you pleased to mention the Almighty, who has the Care over all things, and whom it has pleased, that we should see one another; All the Tribes are come with a good Design, and we hope that GOD will strengthen the Peace &amp; Unity.</P>

<SP>

<P>He that spake last, spake the Minds of all the Tribes; all, both old and young, rejoice to hear your Excellency speak of Peace and Friendship. GOD alone is the Giver of all these Blessings.</P>
<P>It shall be mentioned over the whole Continent, that your Excellency is a Lover of Peace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gov.</SPEAKER>
<P>The great GOD is the Giver of Love and Peace: when JESUS CHRIST, the great Saviour of the World, came down among Men, He said, <HI>Blessed are the Peace-Makers.</HI> I hope Peace and Friendship will continue among the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> to the Children that are unborn.</P>

<P>I am well pleased to hear your Excellency men∣tion GOD's Name, who is the Giver and Orderer of Peace. It is GOD's Will and Pleasure that we have the Opportunity at this Time to see one another. We rejoice that your Excellency mentions the Continuance of Friendship from one Generation to another; and we all, old Men and young, join in that Wish.</P>
<P>I put this as a Pledge to ty Hand in Hand the Peace that is made, from one Generation to another. <STAGE>(<HI>Laid down some Furs.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
<P>I lay this over as a Shade that nothing may fall upon the Peace, but that we may walk under it as a Shelter, that nothing may molest us or our Children after us. <STAGE>(Laid down more Furs.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>As your Excellency was pleased to mention GOD's Over-ruling Hand and to desire that there might be a lasting Peace; It is like wife our Desire that it may be so.</P>
<P>And if any thing of Difference shou'd happen, we desire that Methods may be taken to decide things, for we are all one. All the Body of Indians salute your Excellency as a Confirmation of this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been Sixteen Days from <HI>Boston,</HI> and have been waiting for the <HI>Indians</HI> eight Days. If you have any thing to offer, I should be glad to hear it Now or To-Morrow, or at any other Time. If you have any thing to offer for making the Trade more advantageous I should be glad to hear it. I hope you are treated with Justice and Kindness at the Trading Houses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your Excellency has any thing to offer to us, we Desire you to mention it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I came here at the Desire of your Chief, Capt. <HI>Loron</HI> and others of the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Tribe, who sent me a Letter which was sign'd at the Fort at <HI>St. George's.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We could not desire your Excellency to give your self the Trouble to come to this Place; but when I heard last Winter, that you were coming this Way, we told your Excellency that as many of us as could, would meet you here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>How many of the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Tribe are present here</P>

<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>How many have you last behind?</P>

<SPEAKER>Govern</SPEAKER>
<P>I have Complaints from the Fathers that the <HI>English</HI> fell the <HI>Indians</HI> Rhum, and that they abuse them with it; and I shall be glad to hear from you what Means may be used for preventing this Mischief for the future.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>As a Peace is concluded, there is nothing of any great Moment to be discoursed of, but such Things as will take up but little Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I say to you is a serious Thing: You profess to Worship GOD and JESUS CHRIST, and while you get Drunk, you mock Him, and wrong your selves for this World and that to come. When the Rhum prevailes, you are like <HI>Bevers, Bears</HI> and <HI>Otters,</HI> and don't shew your selves after the Image of GOD in which you were made; and if there were no World to come, where you are to answer for this Wickedness, you hurt your selves with Rhum, as to your Interest in this World; and Ill Men cheat you when you are Drunk with it, and make you give two Skins for one. This is a serious Matter, and de∣serves Consideration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will think of what your Excellency mentions to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have more things to mention.</P>
<P>I have been to St. <HI>George</HI>'s, according to my Duty to King <HI>GEORGE,</HI> to view the King's Fort and the Land there, to consider what may be the most advantageous to the KING and to His People, to be done in that River.</P>
<P>I have been to <HI>Brunswick</HI> and <HI>Richmond,</HI> to see the King's Forts there; and at <HI>Cushnock</HI> and other Places on <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, to see the King's Lands there, and I would have gone further, even to <HI>Norridgewock</HI> and <HI>Penobscot,</HI> if any of the Tribes had been there to accompany me. And as I went into your Country, I should be glad to see you at <HI>Boston.</HI> Bro∣thers and Friends should visit one another at their several Houses. It was in confidence of your sincere Disposition to Peace, that I travel'd into those Parts.</P>
<P>I hope you find the Trading Houses commodious for you, and that you are supplyed cheaper there, than by the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Ca∣nada.</HI></P>
<PB N="7" REF="003554_0007_0FF85F826F1DE7A8"/>
<P>The Government takes Care that you be supplied cheaper than their own People: And I hope the more you are acquainted with the <HI>English</HI> at <HI>Falmouth,</HI> and other Towns in these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, you will find these Settlements commodious and beneficial to you.</P>
<P>And as <HI>Loron</HI> said, If there should be any Cloud hanging over the Peace, you will take Care that we be informed timely of it.</P>
<P>Your coming hither to meet the Governour will not be such a Proof of your Friendship as your giving Notice of these things, and practicing Friendship with us.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but the more you are acquainted with the English, the more you will love them.</P>
<P>It shall be so much my Care to seek your Interest and Advan∣tage, as I doubt not will oblige you to sincere Friendship.</P>
<P>The Government here have settled a Minister at St. <HI>George's,</HI> and there will be another at <HI>Richmond.</HI> They will be always ready to instruct you in the Principles of the Christian Religion, and teach your Children to Read and Write, which shall be with∣out any Cost to you.</P>
<P>If you are willing to send your Children to <HI>Boston,</HI> they shall be brought up to Learning at the <HI>College,</HI> that so they may officiate as Fathers among you, and teach you the true Religion, and their Education shall cost you nothing.</P>
<P>Tho' you have learnt Religion of the <HI>French,</HI> which you may apprehend to be a good one, yet you should not be averse to look into another. Before you knew the <HI>French</HI> Religion, you tho't the <HI>Pagan</HI> Religion to be a good one, but when you were taught the <HI>French</HI> Religion, you tho't that better. And so when you are instructed in the <HI>English</HI> Religion, you may think that still better than the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>If you have a mind to understand the true <HI>English</HI> Religion, it shall cost you nothing; and when you understand it you will certainly know, that you are cheated, when your Sins are pre∣tended to be pardon'd for Skins: This is all a Cheat and Deceit: None can pardon Sins but JESUS CHRIST; and He does it freely, without Money and without Price. All that the Priests make you pay, they put in their own Pockets.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003554_0008_0FF85F65890DD348"/>
I wou'd have you seriously to consider this, and not to be so much prejudiced as not to desire to know further.</P>
<P>If you don't remember what I have now said to you, it shall be written down, that you may carry it with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We will consider of what your Excellency has said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have nothing further to say now, but we will Drink King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wahway.</SPEAKER>
<P>We desire the Favour of a House to shelter us, at the Trading-House on <HI>Saco</HI> River.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll take Care of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wahway.</SPEAKER>
<P>As your Excellency said, that any thing that was prejudicial to us should be mention'd; I would acquaint you, that the <HI>English</HI> young Men hunt the <HI>Bever</HI> among us, where∣by there is danger of a Misunderstanding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fishing, Fowling and Hunting are free to King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Subjects in his Lands; and you have free Liberty to use that Priviledge any where in the King's Lands. You are King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Subjects and so are we: You have acknow∣ledged your Allegiance to Him, a great while ago. We are Bro∣thers, and should hunt and live together.</P>
<P>I have been to <HI>Cushnock,</HI> to pitch upon a Place for Building a good Town for the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> to live together, that they may have a Church there, and a Father to teach them the true Religion and the Way to Heaven.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, We have been thinking of what your Excellency said to us yesterday; and we will now make Answer to it: As to the Lands, which you said are yours what we shall say will not be new, but what has been formerly said. Your Excellency will go on in the Way that former Governours have gone in; which are the Articles of Peace made between us; which are to be observed.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003554_0009_0FF85F83F39E33F0"/>
As to Prayers, It was mention'd in the Treaty, that there should be no Dispute about Religion. It would be a light Proceeding in us, to answer what you have said on that Affair; We are too few to enter into this Dispute, which is a weighty Matter: There are other Tribes to be discoursed with; and when we know their Mind we shall be better able to Answer: We had the Advice of the other Tribes about the Peace; and therefore we think it proper, to have their Advice in this Affair.</P>
<P>As to what was said of our Children, we are not qualified to answer as to the Proposal for their Education, we being but few here, and the other Tribes being concerned in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad you find the Road so plain to walk in. This Government will strictly observe the Articles of Peace, by which we are bound to each other. I meet you further to strengthen the Articles of Peace, and should be glad from Time to Time to hear from you what will further promote it.</P>
<P>As to the Settlement of the Lands and the making of Towns in King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Lands, it shall always be according to the Treaties. I did not mention the Matter of Religion to make any Jar between us, but offer'd it as an Instance of my brotherly Love; and because I am perfectly satisfied, it is the best way to your Interest in this World, and in the World to come. GOD has given you Reason to examine into the Matters of Religion. It will do you no Hurt to examine into the <HI>English</HI> Religion, for then you can chuse that which you shall judge is the best. The Government is willing to instruct you on free Cost. I have no∣thing to do with the foreign Nations; You have said, you are free Men and you are my Brethren. When you received the Popish Priest, it was at your own Election.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We did not intend the <HI>French,</HI> but the other Tribes of Indians, when we talk'd of advising.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a great and serious Affair, and I desire you would consider of it; for we shall willingly send Ministers to in∣struct you in Religion, and School-masters to teach you to read and write: And if at any Time, you will send your Children among us to be educated, they shall be treated with that Kind∣ness, as if they were our own Children.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003554_0010_0FF85F690A846DB8"/>
Nothing can be more for your Interest than to have the Trade under good Regulation, and especially that the pri∣vate Traders should be discountenanced, for I have Complaints from the Priests and others, that they abuse you by selling you Rhum and making you Drunk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Excellency is in the Right: There is much mis∣chief, by their selling us so much Rhum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no Way to prevent this, but by your not Trading with the private Traders, but at the Truck-Houses only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is much to our Advantage to have all other Goods but Rhum brought near us, but it is hurtful to us to bring Rhum among us.</P>
<P><HI>St. George</HI>'s is a great way from us, the Traders bring Goods near us; but it would be well if we could have their Goods at a cheaper Rate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Price of Goods at the Truck-Houses is stated by the Government; and the Truck-Masters can't impose upon you; but the Government can't restrain the private Traders as to their Price. This is what I offer in Friendship to you; for the private Traders do you so much Mischief with their Rhum, that it is as bad as if they should shoot you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We only mention it to your Excellency; we don't suppose that the private Traders can be forced to sell at a Price, but we should be glad it might be; and that they might be re∣st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ined from selling Rhum.</P>
<P>There is not a prudent Care as to the giving out of Liquor at St. <HI>George's,</HI> they give the Indians too much Rhum, which makes them Drunk; and we desire therefore that Care may be ta∣ken to pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern</SPEAKER>
<P>I will give effectual Orders that you shan't be abu∣sed by the Issuing of Rhum at the Truck-Houses.</P>
<P>By the Articles of Peace King <HI>GEORGE</HI> has Power to set∣tle Towns on His Lands; and I purpose to settle a Town at <HI>Cushnock,</HI> and then the Trade will be nearer to you.</P>
<P>When I pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose any thing, and you don't object, I suppose you consent. If there should be a Town, you shall have Lands there, 
<PB N="11" REF="003554_0011_0FF85F876ED66AE0"/>
and live with the <HI>English.</HI> In the Southern Parts of this Pro∣vince, the <HI>Indians</HI> have Towns, and live and dress as the <HI>English</HI> do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not our Way to give a sudden Answer to what is proposed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Proposal I made to you Yesterday.</P>
<P>You told me yesterday, that there was not much Business, the Peace being already concluded; this Interview was only to see one another. I have been a great while from <HI>Boston,</HI> and the King's Business requires my speedy return thither. I shall be glad, if you have any thing to offer, you would mention it this Afternoon: For I purpose you shall dine with me To-Morrow, in order to dismiss you the Day after.</P>
<P>In all things we should be frank and open, and no Body should be here that are afraid to be known. This I say, because I hear there are two <HI>French</HI> Men present; and I shou'd not Care if their Master was here too. I will always do Justice to you; but I will support King <HI>GEORGE's</HI> Honour, who is Lord and Sovereign here; and the <HI>French</HI> shall know it.</P>
<P>How many <HI>French</HI> Men are here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Morning we happened to see some Strangers; but they came in a Vessel on their own Affairs.</P>
<P>It is true, that we are to speak freely to one another; for by the Articles of Peace we are to use this Freedom; and we shall be very open with your Excellency as to what concerns us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Heart is much engaged to prevent the Mischief of the private Trade; the Government receives no Damage by it; but there is Danger that it will make a Misunderstanding be∣tween us: For by this Means you have had such Injustice done you, as the Government can't set to rights: but these Abuses will not be offer'd you at the publick Truck-House.</P>

<P>We are to speak every thing that is true, and hide nothing: As to the Trade, it was agreed, that we should have the Goods as cheap as at <HI>Boston</HI>; and the Governour told us that Goods would be govern'd by the foreign Markets, sometimes cheaper and sometimes dearer; but the Goods have always risen in their Price.</P>

<P>As you are pleased to mention a Trading House, at <HI>Cushnock</HI> it is too weighty for me to lift, but we will consider of it, and return an Answer to it. There are many Persons in∣terested in it, if it were all my own Land, I would say you should be welcome to it Brother; but if I should say so, without the Consent of the other Owners, I should make my self a Jest among them.</P>

<P>You all agreed that the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Tribe should speak for all. And I was pleased to find that my Design of Building a Town at <HI>Cushnock</HI> was so agreeable to your thoughts, for they said the nearer the Trade was the better; and from the Building of this Town, you would reap that immediate Advantage.</P>

<P>I speak for the <HI>Amerescoggin</HI> Indians. We should be glad to have a Trading House near us: As your Excellency said we should speak of any Grievance as to the Trade; <HI>Adia∣wando</HI> and his People are dissatisfied that a <HI>Negro</HI> has the Or∣dering of the Trade at <HI>Saco-River.</HI> We did not know that King <HI>GEORGE</HI> was served by <HI>Negroes.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>That <HI>Negro</HI> is a Servant to the Truck-Master, and he must have some Body to manage the Trade in his Absence; he is a very honest Man. GOD made us of different Colours, the <HI>Negros</HI> black, the <HI>Indians</HI> not so black, and the <HI>English</HI> white; and I don't despise the <HI>Indians</HI> because they are not so white as the <HI>English,</HI> for they are as GOD made them.</P>

<P>I have considered what has been moved as to a Truck∣House for the <HI>Amerescoggin</HI> Indians. And I find the <HI>Amere∣scoggins</HI> and <HI>Pigwackets</HI> are all one Tribe, that the <HI>Pigwackets</HI> are seated near the Truck-House on <HI>Saco</HI> River, and the <HI>Amere∣scoggins</HI> are near <HI>Richmond</HI> Truck-House; that it is a great Charge to the Government to keep a Truck-House; as they are at <HI>Saco</HI> on one side, and <HI>Richmond</HI> on the other, I don't doubt but they may be well accommodated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, You have not given us any answer as to the Rhum that is given out at <HI>George's</HI> Truck-House.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will give special Direction that for the future it shall be given out in a prudent manner, that it shan't be hurtful to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have something to offer further: Your Excellency was pleased to say we should speak plainly. As to the distant Tribes, we think there is something yet wanting. As there is Friendship, we wonder that Powder should be wanting for us to fire a little with. It was mention'd at the Treaty, that Powder should be given to each Tribe. If the Present should be given, those that are at a Distance would think that there is Love be∣tween us; and we are of Opinion that when other Tribes see <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, they would think there is hearty Love between us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean by what you say of Powder?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We mean a Present of Powder and Shot, which was mention'd in the Treaty. As to the Sloop that comes a Trading to <HI>Penobscot,</HI> we don't desire they should be forbid, because it is profitable to us, but only we are willing they should be forbid bringing Rhum.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad it lies much upon your Mind to have the Trade of Rhum prevented. There is no such effectual Way to prevent your being drown'd with Rhum, as your not having to do with private Traders. If there be Convenience for a Sloops coming Spring and Fall to <HI>Penobscot</HI> River, I will endeavour that the Government shall send a Sloop at those Seasons, to bring them every thing but Rhum; and I hope you will not be discon∣tented, if I order my People not to Trade with you in that Article.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="003554_0014_0FF85F6D21EB8090"/>
As to what you mention about Powder, I will consider of it, and I doubt not but you will be gratisied in that Particular; and it shall rest upon my Mind, and I will not forget to endeavour that it be done.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have another small Matter to say: When we come to <HI>St. George's,</HI> we have not Liberty to ly in any of the Houses, but are exposed to ly abroad in the Rain and bad Wea∣ther; we therefore desire a House to lodge in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>I will take Care that you have a House to lodge in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wiwurna.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell your Excellency of something that hap∣pen'd this Summer: Your Excellency's Young Men and ours met at <HI>Brunswick,</HI> and there was a Difference, and the <HI>English</HI> Man wounded the <HI>Indian</HI> very much, tho' he never offer'd to strike him again; and if each Party don't take Care to avoid Quarrels, it will endanger a Misunderstanding between the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>In∣dians.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis the first Time I have heard of it. I will give Order to my Captains to see that you be treated with Justice and Kindness. I am afraid the Rhum was the occasion of this Diffe∣rence, which shews the Necessity of your being restrain'd from that Liquor. I am now told that this Difference arose from some of the <HI>Indians</HI> first insulting Lieut. <HI>Jaques.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wiwurna.</SPEAKER>
<P>We desire that Capt. <HI>Bane</HI> may be continued In∣terpreter at <HI>Richmond,</HI> because it is a great Help to us as to our Language.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I was in <HI>Kennebeck</HI> River, I had Complaints from the Inhabitants that they could keep no Sheep for the <HI>Indi∣an</HI> Dogs: By the Treaty you are obliged to muzzle them. It may seem a light Matter to you, to keep your Dogs loose, but it is a great Discouragement to the <HI>English.</HI> As I shall strictly observe every Article of the Peace, so I expect you should, and therefore you must take Care to keep your Dogs from doing this Mischief to the <HI>English</HI> Inhabitants.</P>
<P>I have a Complaint against one of the young Men of the <HI>Nor∣ridgewock</HI> Tribe from one <HI>Samuel Harden,</HI> that they kill'd five of his Horses at <HI>Hunnawell's</HI> Point, to the Value of <HI>Forty 
<PB N="15" REF="003554_0015_0FF85F8B6AECFF98"/>
Pounds,</HI> for which he has had no Satisfaction. Taking away Men's Estates is like taking away their Lives; and their denying it will not Excuse them. All the Articles of the Peace are made in the Presence of GOD, who observes these things; and I expect Satisfaction for this Injury. I observe your Young Men smile at this; but it is a serious Matter; if you are in want, you must tell us of it. These things will endanger a War. You will think it very hard, if our Young Men should steal your Skins. I believe one of those Young Men is here now; and I would have him come and tell me why he kill'd those Horses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Packahumbanoit.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing more of the Matter, than that the Man that kill'd the Horses is gone to <HI>Canada.</HI> I would not deny it if I were guilty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>It adds to the Guilt to deny the Fact. And I sup∣pose your Father does not teach you to do such Things and then deny it. You should follow such Instructions as are good from your Father.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Packah.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had some of the Meat, but I did not kill the Horses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have reason to think you did it; and if you go on in such Practices, it will bring on great Inconvenience. If you can take GOD and CHRIST to witness that you did not shoot at those Horses, I shall believe you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Packah.</SPEAKER>
<P>I call GOD to Witness, that I did not kill those Horses; it was a <HI>Canada</HI> Indian: I saw him shoot at them, and I ate of the Meat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>When my People complain to me of such Injuries, it is my Duty as their Father to see that they be righted. These Things will be of evil Consequence; and I hope both Old Men and Young will take Care to prevent them for the future.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>As to what was kill'd fix Years ago, it could not cost that Money; but we have often urged the <HI>Indians</HI> to pay the Damage, but we could not perswade them.</P>

<P>It is a great Dishonour to the whole Tribe, and to Councellors and Captains not to have a Regard to their Words. King <HI>GEORGE</HI> brings his Captains and Councellors into Disgrace if they don't re∣gard their Promises; and they are put in Prison till they are made Honest.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">F</SEG>Riend, I have one thing to say to your Excelleney which I am not so well pleased with, <HI>i. e.</HI> that the Price of the Fall <HI>Bever</HI> is so low, it won't come to <HI>Ten Shillings</HI> till <HI>Christmas. Bever</HI> is grown so scarce, that what one Man can get till Winter, will hardly procure a Pair of Stockings. There were formerly seve∣ral Things taken from the Jesuits at <HI>Norridgewock</HI>; which if they were brought again to <HI>Richmond,</HI> we should be glad to pay for them, especially a Writing we saw at <HI>North-Yarmouth.</HI></P>

<P>In whose Hands was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Toxus.</SPEAKER>
<P>One <HI>Drinkwater</HI>'s. Capt. <HI>Woodside</HI> of <HI>Maquoit</HI> has taken good Care of us when we are cold and wanted any Thing; and we desire that what has been said about him, may go no further.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is with Pleasure that I hear what you have to say to me; and I hope what passes between us will make the Peace stronger.</P>
<P>It is best in Time to remove every Difficulty, or else by neg∣lect it may grow greater. There is a great Difference as you know well between Spring and Fall <HI>Bever</HI>: The Market in <HI>England</HI> will always govern the Price here; and as great Quantities of <HI>Bever</HI> are carried there from other Places besides this, that will have an Influence upon the Price here, whether you get much or little: I shall be glad when the Market will allow of a greater Price, which I shall let you know of; and you may depend on it in all Cases to have strict Justice done you: We take Care that the Trade be govern'd as much to your Advantage as may be. You are supplied cheaper from us than from the <HI>French,</HI> which is plain, because they buy of us to sell to you.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="003554_0019_0FF85F9178D26EB8"/>
It is a great while since the Affair happen'd at <HI>Norridgewock,</HI> and I should be glad you had mentioned that Matter before, and then it would have been easier to have recover'd those Things than now: Maj <HI>Moulton</HI> is here, who can tell you that the Plun∣der taken at <HI>Norridgewock,</HI> was divided among the Soldiers, Capt. <HI>Parker</HI> has got the Paper you mention, and will be ready to deliver it upon your paying the Price of it: I should be glad you could have any other Things return'd; but our People made but little Account of them, and I believe the most of them are lost.</P>
<P>I am well pleased that Capt. <HI>Woodside</HI> of <HI>Maquoit</HI> is kind to you, and I shall be glad every Body else would be so too. When Capt. <HI>Woodside</HI> does what is good, it is praise-worthy in him; but if he breaks the Laws of the Province, he must be punished for it.</P>

<P>We mention'd the same Difficulties as to Trade, when we were at <HI>Boston,</HI> especially about Mr. <HI>Noyes</HI>'s Conduct; and you said, the Thing was too far off to be seen, but you would enquire into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard no further Complaints of these Things: Mr. <HI>Noyes</HI> deals fairly and justly by you; It is no Interest of his to take your <HI>Bever</HI> at a low Price: But you may be sure you will have Justice done you.</P>

<P>When we were at <HI>Boston,</HI> you said to Capt. <HI>Gyles</HI> and Capt. <HI>Heath,</HI> we were so far off, you could not tell whether or no things were done as they were represented.</P>

<SPEAKER>Waramanfoot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> trusted me, and I paid the Negro in his Absence; and after that, Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> made me Pay the same again.

<P>As to the Captain at <HI>St. George</HI>'s, we have found no∣thing amiss in him, but like him very well, more especially for his Knowledge of our Language.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Sachem of the <HI>Amerescoggin</HI> Indians will (now he is come) give me a Reason for having the Truck House removed from <HI>Richmond</HI> to <HI>Brunswick,</HI> I will hear him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adiawando.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Reason is, that in the Winter we can't Travel so far as <HI>Richmond</HI> without great Inconvenience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it better to have the Truck House nearer, than further off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loron.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have nothing to say as to other Places; we are satisfied with the Truck House at <HI>St. George</HI>'s; It is near e∣nough for the <HI>Penobscot</HI> Indians.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Truck House at <HI>Richmond,</HI> is nearer to the <HI>Amerescoggin</HI> Indians, than that at <HI>St. George</HI>'s to the <HI>Pe∣nobscots.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lewis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have had no Answer as to the Meal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Govern.</SPEAKER>
<P>I answer'd it before; it was in another TruckMasters time: It is hard now to find out who deliver'd the Meal and Tobacco: I should be glad when any thing is bad, that you would not take it, for you are not obliged to take it.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> are now at Peace with all Nations, with the <HI>Dutch, French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and there is no likelihood of War. When any thing looks like a War, I shall give you No∣tice of it, and expect the same from you as good Friends and Brothers.</P>
<P>And if any such thing as a War should happen among the Nations in <HI>Europe,</HI> that need not affect us; but we may still be good Friends and Neighbours; and I hope in such Case you won't be decoy'd to your Hurt.</P>
<P>When you have any Grievance, I invite you to come to <HI>Boston</HI> seasonably, that so you may be redress'd before the Thing is grown too old to make it clear, and to find out those that have done you any Wrong.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="003554_0023_0FF85F95D19C0E80"/>
Capt. <HI>Loron</HI> has desired of me some <HI>English</HI> Carpenters, to Build him a House; and I have ordered Capt. <HI>Gyles</HI> to send him Men for that Work, who will take Care that he shan't be im∣posed upon in the Price: And if any other Persons desire Houses to be Built, they shall also be assisted in it.</P>
<P>The Sun grows low: To Morrow will be the Lord's Day; If you have any thing further to say, I shall willingly hear you. If not, I shall deliver you the Bounty of the Government, as a Token of Our sincere Desire to maintain the Peace: And when that is done, we will Drink King <HI>GEORGE</HI>'s Health; and then I shall wish you a good Journey to your several Homes.</P>
</SP>
<P>The Indians said they had done.</P>
<P>And then the Presents were deliver'd.</P>
