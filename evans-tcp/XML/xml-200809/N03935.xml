<P>BEING kindly invited by a Minister of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> after Dinner I went to <HI>Rye,</HI> about eleven Miles from <HI>Stanford.</HI> I read Prayers and preached to a small Congregation. Was civilly entertained by the Minister, and then rode ten Miles further to <HI>East-Chester.</HI> Here I spent an agreeable Evening with my dear Companions in Travel, God filled me out of his own divine Fulness, and made me to drink of his Pleasures as out of a River.

Dined and rode six Miles to <HI>King's-Bridge,</HI> where I preached from the Steps of a public House to about 500; but did not perceive much visible Effect. Hither several of <HI>New-York</HI> Friends came to meet me. I talk'd with them on the Way of the Things of God, and found an inexpressible Satisfaction in my Soul when I arrived at the House of my very dear Friend Mr. <HI>Noble.</HI> After Supper, the Lord filled my Heart, and gave me to wrestle with him for <HI>New-York</HI> Inhabitants, and my own dear Friends. To add to my Comfort, the Lord bro't my Dear Brother <HI>Davenport</HI> from <HI>Long-Island</HI> by whose Hands the blessed Jesus has of late done <HI>great</HI> Things. In a Letter to his Mother he writes thus: <Q>The Lord has, in infinite Mercy, given me, in my Parish, near twenty, in a little more than two Months Time.

<P><HI>Friday, October</HI> 31. Met with a bitter Pamph∣let wrote against me by some of the Presbyterian Persuasion, and found Freedom given me to answer it. I long since expected close Opposition from that Quarter. I believe it will be increasing daily. The Lord will make me more than Conqueror thro' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Met also with two Volumes of Sermons published in <HI>London</HI> as delivered by me, tho' I never preached on most of the Texts. But <HI>Satan</HI> must try all Ways to bring the Work of God into Contempt. Blessed be God, who enables me abundantly to rejoice in all Things that befal me.
<PB N="5" REF="004851_0004_100E01FE4D1B6478"/>Preached in the Morning at Mr. <HI>P—n</HI>'s Meeting House: But never saw the Word of God fall with such Weight in <HI>New-York</HI> before. Two or three cri∣ed out. <HI>Mr. Noble</HI> could scarce refrain himself. And, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where I would, many seem'd deeply wounded. At Night the Word was attended with great Power. One cried out; and the Lord enabled me, at the latter End of my Sermon, to speak with Authority. Alas! How vain are the Thoughts of Men! As I came along Yesterday, I found my Heart somewhat dejected, and told Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> I expected but little Movings in <HI>New-York;</HI> but Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> bid me "expect great Things from God," and likewise told me of several who were, as he hoped, savingly wrought upon by my Ministry, when there last. <HI>O Lord, let these Things humble my Soul for thy own Name's Sake.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, November</HI> 1. Finished my Answer to the Pamphlet. God enabled me to write it in the Spirit of Meekness. <HI>O Lord, give it thy Blessing!</HI> Preached twice as Yesterday to very crowded Audi∣tories, and neither Time without Power. In the Evening Exercise, some fainted, and the Lord seem∣ed to shew us more and more, that a Time for favour∣ing <HI>New-York</HI> was near at Hand. <HI>O wherefore did I doubt! Lord increase my Faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, November</HI> 2. Preached this Morning with Freedom and some Power, but was much dejected before the Evening Sermon. For near half an Hour before I left Mr. <HI>Noble</HI>'s House, I could only lie before the Lord and say, <Q>I was a poor Sinner, and wonder that Christ would be gracious to such a Wretch</Q> As I went to Meeting, I grew weak∣er and weaker, and when I came into the Pulpit, I
<PB N="6" REF="004851_0005_100E020115D07130"/>could have chose to be silent rather than speak. But, after I had begun, the Spirit of the Lord gave me Freedom, till at length it came down like a mighty Rushing Wind, and carried all before it. Immedi∣ately the whole Congregation was alarmed. Shriek∣ing, Crying, Weeping and Wailing were to be heard in every Corner. Men's Hearts failing them for Fear, and many falling into the Arms of their Friends. My Soul was carried out till I could scarce speak any more. A Sense of God's Goodness overwhelmed me. As I went down, a Woman said, <Q>Come and s;ee what God has done for me To-night.</Q> I look∣ed, and her Daughter, in a great Agony, was cry∣ing out, "Oh my Jesus, my Jesus!" Another, a little Boy, was so concerned on the Pulpit Stairs, that he could scarce stand. One of my Friends asked him why he cried, <Q>Who can help it? said he. Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Words cut me to the Heart.</Q> After I came home, I threw myself upon the Bed, and in an awful Silence, admired the infinite Freeness, So∣vereignty and Condescension of the Love of God. I was unwilling to move, but was called down to the Marriage of Mr. <HI>B—r,</HI> whom I met at <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> who being espoused to the young Woman, was so struck at the same Place, by my Advice, who married her this Night, and both are going as my Assistants to <HI>Georgia.</HI> Never did I see a more solemn Wedding. Jesus Christ was called, and he was present in a remarkable Manner. After Mr. <HI>P—n</HI> had married them, I prayed. But my Soul, how was it enabled to wrestle with and lay hold on God! I was in a very great Agony, and the Holy Ghost was remarkably present, that most, I believe, could say, <HI>Surely God is in this Place!</HI> After this, Divine
<PB N="7" REF="004851_0006_100E020387EB9A68"/>Manifestations flowed in so fast, that my frail Ta∣bernacle was scarce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to sustain them. My dear Friends sat round <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the Bed-sides. I prayed for each of them alternately with strong Cries, and pier∣ced by the Eye of Faith, even within the Veil. I continued in this Condition for about half an Hour, astonished at my own Vileness, and the Excellency of Christ, then rose full of Peace, &amp; Love &amp; Joy. O how am I obliged to my Enemies? God has remark∣ably revealed himself to my Soul, ever since I have seen the Pamphlet published by the Presbyterians against me. O how faithful is he that hath promi∣sed, <HI>It shall bruise thy Heel, and thou shalt bruise his Head; Lord enable me to lay hold on this, during the Time of my sojourning here on Earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Nov.</HI> 3. Preached both Morning and Afternoon, and perceived the Congregations still in∣crease. There was a great and gracious Melting amongst the People both Times, but no crying out. Near 110 <HI>l.</HI> Currency were collected for the Or∣phans; and in the Evening many came and took an affectionate Leave. About seven we took Boat; reached <HI>Staten Island</HI> about ten, greatly refreshed in my inner Man. A dear Christian Friend received us gladly. We solaced ourselves by singing and praying. And about Midnight retired to sleep, still longing for that Time when I should sleep no more. <HI>Lord keep me from a sinful and 100 cager Desire after Death. I desire not to be impatient. I desire quietly to wait till my bless;ed Change come. Amen and Amen.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Tuesday, November</HI> 4. Preached from a Waggon on <HI>Staten Island,</HI> to about 3 or 400 People. The
<PB N="8" REF="004851_0007_100E0205943DEE38"/>Lord came amongst them. One dear young Man, in particular, as tho' his very Heart-strings would break, came to me after Sermon, with strong Cry∣ings and Tears, beseeching me, <Q>to pray that he might be converted</Q>. Many others wept also, and several of God's Children felt the Presence of the dear Lord Jesus in their Hearts. Many of them rejoiced to see me again. One gray-headed Man came and told me how God had brought him from Darkness to Light, when I was here last. My Soul was also much refreshed with the Sight of dear Mr. <HI>Gilbert Tennent</HI> and Mr. <HI>Cross.</HI> The former has lately lost his Wife, and though dear unto him, yet he was enabled with great Calmness to preach her funeral Sermon, whilst the Corps were lying be∣fore him. This put me in Mind of <HI>Melancthon,</HI> who, at the News of his Wife's Death, said. "By <HI>Kate,</HI> I'll come after thee ere it be long." Since his Wife's Decease, Mr. <HI>Tennent</HI> has ben in the <HI>West Jerseys</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> and told me how God re∣markably work'd by his Ministry in many Places. — Mr. <HI>Cross</HI> also has seen great and wonder∣ful Things in his Congregations, so great that when I came to desire a particular Account, he said, <Q>It directly answered the Account given by Mr. <HI>Ed∣wards,</HI> of the Work of God in <HI>Northampton.</HI></Q> <HI>What is the Lord Jesus about to do! If the Beginning is so great, what will the End of these Things be!</HI> Rode after Sermon to <HI>Newark,</HI> about ten Miles from <HI>Staten Island.</HI> Preached to a considerable Congregation, but it being dark before I concluded, I could not see what Impressions the Discourse made. I fear but little. However, at Night the Lord ma∣nifested forth his Glory. For coming down to Fa∣mily
<PB N="9" REF="004851_0008_100E0207B9B88510"/>Prayer, where I lodged, and perceiving many young Men around me, my Soul, was as it wer, melted down with Concern for them. After sing∣ing I gave a Word of Exhortation. With what Power none can fully express but those that saw it. O how did the Word fall like a Hammer and like a Fire! What a Weeping was there? One poor Creature in particular was ready to sink into the Earth. His Countenance was altered, till he looked as it were, sick to Death. At length he said, "What shall I do to be saved?" Others were dis∣solved into Tears around him; and one of my Fellow-Travellers was struck down, &amp; so overpow∣ered, that his Body became exceeding weak. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would scarce move all the Night after. God, I be∣lieve, was now working powerfully on his Soul. As for my own Part I was almost spent.

<P><HI>Wednesday, November</HI> 5. Set out about eight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Morning. Got to <HI>Baskinridge,</HI> the Place where Mr. <HI>Cross</HI> exercises his stated Ministry, about one o'Clock. At the House where I waited in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, a Woman spoke to me, under strong Convic∣tions, and told me, "She was deeply wounded by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my last Night's Discourse." When I came to <HI>Baskinridge,</HI> I found Mr. <HI>Davenport,</HI> according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppointment, had been preaching to the Congrega∣tion
<PB N="10" REF="004851_0009_100E0209E6C7E6F8"/>It consisted of about 3000 People. As I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent along I told a Friend, <Q>My Soul wept for them, and I was perswaded within my self, that the Lord would in that Day make his Power to be known amongst them.</Q> In Prayer, I per∣ceived my Soul drawn out, and a Stirring of Affec∣tion among the People. I had not discoursed long, but the Holy Ghost displayed his Power. In every Part of the Congregation, some Body or other be∣gan to cry out, and almost all melted into Tears. This abated for a few Moments, till a little Boy about seven or eight Years of Age cried out exceed∣ing piteously indeed, and wept as though his little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eart would break. Mr. <HI>Cross</HI> having Compassion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, took him up into the Waggon, which so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fected me that I broke from my Discourse, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the People, <Q>The little Boy should preach to them, and that God, since old Professors would not cry after Christ, had displayed his Sovereign∣ty, and out of an Infant's Mouth was perfecting Praise.</Q> God so blessed this, that an universal concern fell on the Congregation again. Fresh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sons dropp'd down here and there, and the Cry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eased more and more. At length I concluded, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as I was going away, I asked the little Boy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat he cried for?" He answered, "his Sins," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> asked, "What he wanted?" He answered, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Christ." As I passed along, fresh Instances of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Power presented themselves to my View. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any mourning after Jesus that would not be com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rted. After Sermon, Mr. <HI>Cross</HI> gave Notice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ening Lecture in his Barn, about two Miles off. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ither we went, and a great Multitude followed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r. <HI>Gilbert Tennent</HI> preached first, and that excel∣lently
<PB N="11" REF="004851_0010_100E020C1D6CC6A0"/>well upon the Necessity and Benefit of spiri∣tual Desertions. I then began to pray, and felt the Spirit of God working in me mightily. A great Commotion was soon observed among the Hearers. I then gave a Word of Exhortation. The Lord's Presence attended it in a surprizing Manner. One in about six Minutes cried out. <HI>"He is come, he is come,"</HI> and could scarce sustain the Discovery that Jesus Christ made of himself to his Soul. Others were so earnest for a Discovery of the Lord to their Souls, that their eager Crying obliged me to stop, and I prayed over them as I saw their Agonies and Distress increase. At length we sung a Hymn, and then retired to the House where the Man that re∣ceived Christ continued till near Midnight, talking of and praising, <Q><HI>his</HI> sweet <HI>Christ, his</HI> free-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Christ,</HI></Q> &amp;c. A gracious Woman, who had been wrestling with God for a Display of his Power, was so overcome with a Sense of his Goodness, that she almost swoon'd away. And at length, my own Soul was so full that I retired, and was in a strong Agony for some Time, and wept before the Lord, under a deep Sense of my own Vileness, and the Sovereignty and Greatness of God's everlasting Love. Most of the People spent the Remainder of the Night in Prayer and Praises. Two or three young Ministers spake alternately, and others prayed as the Lord gave them Utterance. Oh! It was a Night much to be remember'd! <HI>May the Lord make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of it even to the Day of our Death. Amen &amp; Amen.</HI></P>

Before I mounted my H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> came to me under great Soul-Concern. A Lad about thirteen Years old told me, <Q>He never felt Sin before Yesterday.</Q> A poor "Negroe-Wo∣man said, she was filled with a Love of Christ; and being too fond of the Instrument, would fain have gone with me.

When I was upon my Horse several Women came to shake me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Hand. I asked one "whether she knew Christ?" She said "yes." "How long?" "Three Years, said she, the third <HI>Sunday</HI> in next <HI>March."</HI> I asked another the same Question. She answered "Yes, but I am waiting for a fresh "Brea∣thing from the blessed Spirit. I, with Pleasure, took my Leave of them, and rode agreeably in Com∣pany with many Children of God to <HI>New-Brunswick,</HI> 23 Miles from <HI>Baskinridge.</HI> Here Letters awaited me from <HI>Savannah,</HI> acquainting me that there had been a great Mortality amongst the People of that Place.

Particulars I shall (God willing) relate hereafter. Let it suffice a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> present, that both in the Morning and Evening, God's Glory filled the House: For there was great Power in the Congregation. It was never preach'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before. The Root is not yet up, but the People <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sed a convenient Pulpit, and boarded the Bottom. The Joy of most of the Hearers, when they saw me, was in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pressible: Some still mocked. Between Services I received a Packet of Letters from <HI>England,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in <HI>March</HI> last—<HI>May the Lord heal, and ring Good out of the Divisions, which, at present, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be among the Brethren there!</HI> — God giving
<PB N="16" REF="004851_0015_100E0216CEE2E5D8"/>me Freedom, and many Friends being in the Room, I kneeled down and prayed with and exhorted them all. But, Oh how did they melt under both; My Soul was much rejoiced to look round on them, be∣cause there were some who were now fairly brought through the Pangs of the New-Birth, who had been most marvellous Offenders against the great God. I shall mention two only. The first is one Mr. <HI>Brockden,</HI> Recorder of Deeds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>a Man eminent in his Profession, but for many Years a notorious Deist. In his younger Days, he told me, he had some religious Impressions, but coming into Bu∣siness, the Cares of the World so choaked the good Seed, that he not only forgat his God in some Degree, but at length began to doubt of, and to dispute his very Being. In this State he continued many Years, and has been very zea∣lous to propagate his Deistical, I could almost say Atheistical Principles among moral Men, but he told me he never endeavoured to make Proselytes of vicious, debauched People. When I came to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> this Time Twelve-month, he told me, he had not so much as a Curiosity to hear me. But a Brother Deist, his choicest Friend, pressing him to come and hear me, to satisfy his Curiosity, he at length complyed with his Request, It was Night. I preach'd at the Court House Stairs, upon the Conference which our Lord had with <HI>Nicodemus.</HI>—I had not spoke much before God struck his Heart. For, said he, I saw your Doctrine tended to make People good. His Fa∣mily knew nothing that he had been to hear me. After he came Home, his Wife, who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Sermon, came in also, and wished heartily that he
<PB N="17" REF="004851_0016_100E021A2401AE90"/>had heard me. He said nothing. After this, another of his Family came in repeating the same Wish; and, if I mistake not, after that another, till at last being; unable to refrain any longer, with Tears in his Eyes. Why, says he, I have been hearing him; and then expressed his Approbation. Ever since he has followed on to know the Lord, and I verily believe Jesus Christ has made himself ma∣nifest to his Soul. Though upwards of three score Years old, he is now I believe born again of God. He is a little Child, and often (as he told me) receives such Communications from God, when he retires into the Woods, that he thinks he could die a Martyr for the Truth.</Q> <Q>The next is one CAPTAIN H—L, formerly as great a Reprobate as ever I heard of: Almost a Scandal and Reproach to human Nature. He used to Swear to ease his Stomach, and was so fond of new Oaths that he used to go on Board the Tran∣sport Ships, and offer a Guinea for a new Oath, that he might have the Honour of coining it. It would be endless to give Instances of his vile Pro∣faneness. To the Honour of God's Grace let it be said, he is now, I believe, a Christian. Not only reformed, but renewed. The effectual Stroke, he told me, was given, when I preached last Spring at <HI>Pennypack,</HI> though under good Impressi∣ons before. Ever since he has been zealous for the Truth, stood like a Lamb when was beaten, and in Danger of being murdered some time ago, by many of my Opposers, and, in short, shews forth his Faith by his Works.</Q> I might speak also of some Quakers, who are fairly brought into an experimental Acquaintance with Christ, who are
<PB N="18" REF="004851_0017_100E021C4D495248"/>chosen with my self, the aforesaid <HI>B—n</HI> and <HI>H—l,</HI> and some others joint Trustees for the House lately erected.—But I mention these in particular, because I think they are remarkable Proofs of that too much exploded Doctrine, I mean, <HI>God's Eternal Election and everlasting Love.</HI> <Q>Whatever Men's carnal Reasoning may suggest, yet if the Children of God fairly examine their own Experiences, if they do God Justice, they must acknowledge that they did not choose God, but God chose them. And if he chose them at all, it must be from Eternity, and that too without any Regard to any Thing foreseen in them. Unless they acknowledge this, Man's Salvation must be in Part owing to the Free-Will of Man, and if so, unless Men descend from other Parents than I did, Christ Jesus might have died, and never have seen the Travel of his Soul in the Salvation of one of his Creatures. But I would be tender in this Point and leave Per∣sons to be taught it of <HI>God.</HI> I am of the Mar∣tyr <HI>Bradford's</HI> Mind.</Q> <HI>Let a Man go to the Grammar School of Faith and Repentance, before he goes to the University of Election and Predestination.</HI> A bare Head-Knowledge of the Form of sound Words availeth nothing. I am quite sick of Christless Tal∣kers. <HI>From such may I ever turn away!</HI> Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, November</HI> 10. Preached Morning and Afternoon to very large Congregations, and observed a wonderful sweet Power attend both, but especially the Evening-Sermon. Many afterwards came and told me what God did for their Souls thereby. All the vacant Time before and after preaching, I em∣ployed in answering my <HI>English</HI> Letters. <HI>Lord bless
<PB N="19" REF="004851_0018_100E021E76B7F710"/>what was written to the Consolation and Edification of my dear Friends for Jesus Christ's Sake.</HI> Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, November</HI> 15. Preached twice every Day this Week in the new House, one Morning excepted, when I preached in Mr. C—'s Meet∣ing-House on Account of the Snow. A most sweet and wonderful Power went at that Time through the Congregation. The Lord gave me the Text I preached on just before Meeting; directed me to a Method as I was going up the Pulpit-Stairs; and enabled me to discourse with an uncommon Clear∣ness, Freedom, and Power. The Effects plainly shewed that it was of God. — The Word seemed to smite them like so many pointed Arrows. Ma∣ny afterwards told me what they felt, and in the Evening I was sent for to a young Woman, who was carried Home from Meeting, and had continued almost speechless. When I came, she look'd like a Person dead and laid out. I prayed with her, and heard afterwards that she came out into a more com∣fortable State.— <HI>Blessed be the Name of the Lord.</HI> Indeed I cannot say we had one dry Meeting. The least Moving, I think, was one Afternoon, when I was unaccountable carried out to talk against Reasoning Unbelievers. When I was at Dinner I had not fixed upon a Text. When I was going to preach, I was so ill that some of my Friends advised me to go Home. I thought it best to trust to God. I went on, began Preaching, and found my Heart, somewhat refreshed, but all on a sudden, my Soul was so carried out to talk against depending on our natural Reason, that my Friends were astonished, and so was I too: For I felt the Holy Ghost come
<PB N="20" REF="004851_0019_100E02200319DE78"/>upon me at that Time, and never spake on that wise before. <Q>As I was going Home, I said to a Friend, Surely some Reasoners were in the Congregati∣on.</Q> Upon Enquiry, I found a Cluster of them were present, and then I knew wherefore I was so assisted. <HI>Oh who would but trust in God!</HI> One of these Reasoners a little after, meeting Mr. <HI>B—n,</HI> said, <Q>What! Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> could not make the People cry this Afternoon.</Q> <Q>A good Reason for it, says Mr. <HI>B—n,</HI> he was preaching a∣gainst Deists, and you know they are a harden'd Generation.</Q> <HI>Lord, take from them a Heart of Stone, and give them a Heart of Flesh. Alba, Father, all Things are poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> with thee.</HI></P>
<P>Another Afternoon, there was such an universal Commotion in the Congregation, as I never saw in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> before. One or two cried out in a most piteous Manner, and Numbers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sorely, that I broke off Prayer after Sermon sooner than otherwise I should have done. The Children of God were melted down, and their Souls magnified the Lord. I preached on those Words, <HI>What shall I do to be saved?</HI> And as I afterwards found, was very providentially directed to that Subject. For one Mrs. <HI>P—r,</HI> as I have it in a Paper taken from her own Mouth, went to Mr. <HI>Cummins</HI> to know, "Why I should not preach in the Church?" He, after several Invectives cast out against me, said,<HI>He could not answer his Oath to the Bishop of</HI> London, <HI>if he did give me Leave,</HI> and cautioned her against go∣ing to hear me; adding, <HI>That if she followed or adher∣ed to what I said, she was in a woful Condition."</HI> Nay, said he, <HI>You are damned if you do.</HI> With all, he told her, <HI>He was distressed in his Soul for her, because she
<PB N="21" REF="004851_0020_100E02222D74B800"/>was a good Liver, and brought up under pio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Pa∣rents.</HI> Mrs. <HI>P—r</HI> asked, <Q>If she, by God's Assistance, could live up to the Doctrine and Ex∣ample of our Saviour and the Apostles, as laid down in the New-Testament, she should not do well?</Q> He answered, "Yes." Then, Sir, replied she, <Q>I must believe in Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Doctrine.</Q> <HI>There now,</HI> says he, <HI>you are running out again; I tell you, you are mad. Go Home and hear him no more, and you'll do well enough.</HI> No, Sir, says Mrs. <HI>P—r,</HI> <Q>I cannot stay away. And seeing so many People admire Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI>'s Doctrine, and you so, bitter against him, <HI>What must I do to be saved?</HI> For you are enough to distract me between you.</Q> <HI>You are good enough,</HI> replied Mr. <HI>Cummins, and may dance or play at Cards and be in a far better Way than</HI> Whitefield <HI>or his Fol∣lowers. — For my Part. I will wash my Hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your Blood, and will leave you.</HI> <Q>No, said Mrs. <HI>P—r,</HI> You love Money too well, Sir, to leave this Place.</Q> After a great deal more Conversation, Mrs. <HI>P—r</HI> left him in great Distress of Mind, and often repeating to herself, <HI>Lord, what shall I do to be saved?</HI> Contrary to Mr. <HI>Cummin</HI>'s Advice, she went in the Afternoon, says the Paper before me, to hear Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> and he providentially preached on the trembling Jaylor's Words. <HI>What shall I do to be saved?</HI> Which gave the Gentlewo∣man so much Satisfaction and Comfort, that she is thankful to God for having an Opportunity of hear∣ing that Text explained, is much strenthened, per∣fectly easy, and will by God's Grace follow his Commandments. <HI>Lord, for thy Mercies Sake, work in her both her to will and to do, after thy good Plea∣sure.
<PB N="22" REF="004851_0021_100E022455ACC078"/>Amen and Amen.</HI> It would be almost end∣less to recount all the particular Instances of God's Grace, which I have seen this Week past. Many that before were only convicted, now plainly proved, that they were converted and had a clear Evidence of it within themselves. My chief Business was now to build up and to exhort them to continue in the Grace of God. Notwithstanding many were convicted almost every Day, and came unto me, un∣der the greatest Distress and Anguish of Soul. Seve∣ral Societies are now in the Town, not only of Men and Women, but of little Boys and little Girls. Being so engaged, I could not visit them as I would, but I hope the Lord will raise me up some Fellow-Labourers, and that Elders will be ordained in every Place then we shall see a glorious Church, settled and established in <HI>Philadelphia. Hasten that Time, O Lord, my Strength &amp; my Redeemer.</HI> I cannot leave off giving an Account of this Week's Work, without menti∣oning another Instance or two of God's Grace. One Woman came to me, I think fairly converted to our dear Lord Jesus. She told me, when I was at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> last, <Q>She came desiring that I would baptize her Child. I being otherwise enga∣ged, refused. Upon this the Devil assaulted her, being under strong Convictions, in a most violent Manner, and endeavoured to persuade her, that all I had told her were Lies. She was cast into Darkness, but reasoned thus, It is impossible that it should be Lies, or that I should be a false Pro∣phet, since the Word came with such Light, E∣vidence and unspeakable Power upon her Soul, when she heard me. She went home, retired to Bed, and there the Devil would fain have per∣suaded
<PB N="23" REF="004851_0022_100E0225F5AEA918"/>her to cut her Child's Throat with a Pair of of Scissars. She being bro't into the utmost Extre∣mity, cried and looked up to Christ. He delive∣red her out of her Distress. Satan immediately left her, and God flowed in upon her Soul. She now knows that her Redeemer liveth. <HI>Praise the Lord, O my Soul!</HI> Another young Woman, who I believe was made a wise Virgin last Spring, and received Jesus Christ in her Heart, acquain∣ted me, "That she continued in great Joy for near three Days, and went as far as <HI>New-Castle,</HI> to hear me, when I took my Leave last. As she was returning, some Body told her, <HI>I believed E∣lection.</HI> Alas! Then, said she, (though she was converted) what will become of me? She fell into Darkness, retired into the Woods, and by Degrees, she told me, solid Comfort returned to her Soul.</Q> <HI>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> said I, <HI>do you believe Electi∣on?</HI> <Q>Yes says she. with the utmost Confidence. It cannot but be so.</Q> <HI>Oh that all who are preju∣diced against that Doctrine were thus taught of God!</HI> They would not ignorantly call the Doctrine of E∣lection the Doctrine of Devils, or cry out vehement∣ly against the HORRIBLE DECREE. But, as an excellent Christian observes, <HI>The Doctrine of Election is such a glorious Mystery, that it dazzles the weak Eyes even of some of God's dear Children.</HI> But I have reserved the most sweet Proof of God's Grace and Power to the last. About the Middle of the Week I was called to visit one Mrs. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then lying on a sick Bed, but after prodigious Agonies, brought home to God when I was at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> last Spring. <Q>Her Husband was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Sea, and since his Re∣turn home, has greatly persecuted his Wife, deny∣ing
<PB N="24" REF="004851_0023_100E022822EF8310"/>her spiritual Friends leave to come unto her. God now inclined his Heart to let me come and pray with her, according to her Desire. When I went the first Time, he was not in the Room, but was offended that he was not called up to join with us. The next Day he himself met me in the Street, and gave me an Invitation. I compli∣ed, and visited his Wife several Times. But ne∣ver before did I see a Soul so exult in God, and talk so seelingly of the Love of Jesus, though sometimes in Extremity of Pain. Sometimes she was so full of God that she could not speak, and at other Times, when she could not speak, and <HI>I bid her lift up her Hands if all was well,</HI> she stretched them with great Earnestness. As soon as ever she could recover Breath, she would talk of Jesus, saying that his Love was above her Pain, that she longed to be dissolved, but was willing to tarry the Lord's Leisure. When I told her, <HI>that I wanted to be gone too.</HI> No, says she, do you stay longer, and bring home some more Souls to Christ; with many other gracious Words, which dropped from her Mouth. My Soul was much enlarged to hear a Creature talk with such Assurance just upon the Brink of Eternity. Her Husband and other Friends stood weeping by. God gave me great Assistance in Prayer. His Presence filled the Room, and some I thought would have cried out.</Q> <HI>Oh that this Sickness may be a Means un∣der God of saving her Relations precious and immortal Souls!</HI> After my Departure, she bid one of my Friends tell me, "That she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed and lived from the Doctrine which I had preached." When he asked her, <HI>What she thought of the Righteousness of Christ?</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="004851_0024_100E022A4E7A0248"/>"Oh, says she, my Soul is wrapped up in it!" <HI>Lord Jesus, let her repose her Confidence in thee even to the last. Into thy Hands I commend her Spirit: For thou hast redeemed it, O Lord thou God of Truth!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, November</HI> 16. Preached both Morning and Evening, and collected both Times about 105 <HI>l. Sterling</HI> for the Orphans. In the Morning my Soul was peculiarly enlarged, tho' I was somewhat dejected before I left my Lodgings. In the After∣noon, I publickly baptized five adult Women, who had undergone a strict Examination. Before Ser∣mon I gave them an earnest Exhortation. They melted sweetly under the Word, and every Thing was carried on with great Solemnity. I preached from these Words of St. <HI>Jude, But ye, Beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy Faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep your selves in the Love of God, looking for the Mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal Life.</HI> The Congregation was very large, tho' I think not near so large as when I took my Leave last Spring. There was Abundance of Weeping when I came to the Con∣clusion of my Discourse. Great Numbers flock'd to my Lodgings, some under Distress, some to give Thanks for what God had done for their Souls, and others to present me with something for the poor Orphans. One that was baptized brought three Children, I baptized them, prayed, and gave a Word of Exhortation with a melting Heart to many dear Souls. In the Evening I went with my dear Friend Mr. <HI>Noble</HI> to take a final Leave of Mrs. <HI>D</HI>—yet rejoicing in God. Visited a poor distracted Woman, and afterwards went to the Boys Society, where I met with a tender hearted Lad or two; then I returned home, and at last went to Bed, quite
<PB N="26" REF="004851_0025_100E022C744028E0"/>weary as to my outward Man, but inwardly rejoic∣ing in God my Saviour. <HI>Oh that I could do more for Jesus Christ! He is kinder and kinder to me every Day. Praise the Lord, O my Soul!</HI></P>

<P><HI>Monday, November</HI> 17. Was much melted at parting from my dear Friends. Had it much im∣pressed upon my Mind, that I should go to <HI>England,</HI> and undergo Trials for the Truth's Sake. These Words, <HI>The Jews sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither again?</HI> with our Lord's Answer, have been for some Time lying upon me: And whilst my Friends were weeping round me St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Words darted into my Soul. <HI>What mean you to weep and break my Heart? I am willing not only to be bound, but to die for the Lord Jesus.</HI> After fervent Prayer, I took my Leave of some, but being to preach at <HI>Gloucester</HI> in the <HI>West Jerseys,</HI> others accompanied me in Boats over the River. We sung, as we failed, but my Heart was low. I preached at <HI>Gloucester,</HI> but found myself weighed down, and not able to de∣liver my Sermon with my usual Vigour. However there was an affecting Melting, and several (as I heard afterwards) who had been in Bondage before, at that Time received Joy in the Holy Ghost. With Abundance of Tears, after Dinner most of <HI>Philadel∣phia</HI> Friends that came over the Water took their last Farewell. To see us part was somewhat Mo∣ving. I rode on in Company with several to <HI>Green∣wich,</HI> and preached to a few, and scarce with any Power. My Animal Spirits were almost gone, and Assistances suspended. In the Evening we travelled
<PB N="27" REF="004851_0026_100E022E0144CC70"/>on a few Miles, but my Body was more and more out of Order, and I thought God was preparing me for future Blessings. <HI>It is good to be humbled.

<P><HI>Saturday, November</HI> 22. Preached in the After∣noon to many Thousands, and God was again plea∣sed mightily to own his Word. There was a won∣drous powerful Moving, but it did not rise to such a Degree as when I preached last Spring. I was ta∣ken ill after Preaching. Straining caused me to vo∣mit much. I rode about twelve Miles, was kindly received into House with all my Friends, and thought it advisable to retire to Bed immediately. But on a sud∣den, God's Presence so filled my Soul that I could scarce stand under it. I prayed and exhorted, &amp; exhorted and prayed again, but with such Power that every Person in the Room seemed to be under very great Impressions, sighing and weeping from the very Bot∣tom of their Soul, and one in particular roared for the very Disquietness of her Heart. This continued for near an Hour or two; but at last my outward Man was so weak, and my inward Communications so strong, that I was quite overpowered. A dear Friend undressed me. The Lord gave me sweet Sleep, and in the Morning I arose with my natural Strength much renewed. <HI>Blessed be the Lord my God, from whom alone cometh every temporal Gift, as well as my eternal Salvation!</HI></P>

<P><HI>Sunday, November</HI> 23. Rode four Miles, and got to <HI>Nottingham</HI> about ten. But it raining much, and the People thereby being prevented gathering so soon, I preached about one to a large Congregation, who seem'd in no wise no regard the Rain, so they might be watered with the Dew of God's Blessing.

<P>As your Aunt and I were praying to our Lord Jesus to give her the Comforts of his Holy Spirit to support her under the Agonies of Death, she replied, <HI>I see him! I see him! Now I see Light.</HI> After this she continued in Prayer about half an

Come Jesus.</HI> Then again she spake out plainly, and said, <HI>Who would die without a God? Now I see Light. God has let me see my Error. I had not repented of my original Sin. O the False∣ness of our Heart! O search your Hearts, before you come to this; for they are false.</HI> Then she lay in an Agony about half an Hour, and again spake out, and said, <HI>God has let me see great and glorious Things which would not be believed, if they were told.</HI> Then your Uncle <HI>R—s</HI> coming in∣to the Room spake to your Aunt <HI>S—s,</HI> and your <HI>dying</HI> Aunt hearing his Voice, calleth him to her, and when he was come, she spake to us and said, <HI>Mind what I say to you; for hereafter you must all give an Account of what I now say to you; for I speak by the Spirit of God. He has enabled me to speak to you before I go, (for I am just a going.)</HI> Then she said, <HI>God is a just God as well as merci∣ful. Be diligent in searching your Hearts.

In the Beginning of the Voyage, my Body was Weak, and my Soul somewhat low. But afterwards God was pleased to strengthen me both in Body and Soul. These Words came one Day with great Power upon my Heart, <HI>Arise, Go into Nineveh, the great City, and preach unto it the Preaching that I bid thee.</HI> At another Time, the Lord spoke to me by these Words, <HI>Take the Foxes, the little Foxes that spoil the Vines: For our Vines have tender Grapes.</HI> This Part of <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Blessing was one Night brought home to me with a sweet Power: <HI>The Archers have sorely grieved him, and that at him, and hated him. But his B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w abode in Strength, and the Arms of his Hands were made strong, by the Hands of the mighty God of Jacob,</HI> And, at another Time, when my Soul was dejected at a Sense of my own Weaknesses, and the Number and Greatness of my impending <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, the Lord raised and comforted me with this
<PB N="45" REF="004851_0044_100E0255CF22E890"/>Promise: <HI>Fear thou not, for I am with thee: Be not dismayed, for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the Right Hand of my Righteousness.</HI> The Books of <HI>Genesis</HI> and <HI>Exodus,</HI> which I expounded in Course, Morning and Evening, were much blessed to my spi∣ritual Comfort. And the Lord has been pleased to give me Freedom to write down some of my extem∣pore Discourses, which I hope he will bless for his own Name's Sake. In short, this Voyage has been a profitable Voyage to my Soul, because of my having had many sweet Opportunities for Reading, Medita∣tion and Prayer. I cannot but adore the Providence of God in favouring me with such blessed Retirements as I have frequently enjoyed on the great Waters. I dared not expect to meet with such Success as he has been pleased to give me abroad: And I doubt not but I shall yet see greater Things there as well as at home. I never had such a Variety of Trials and Changes of Life lying before me as at this Time. But I throw myself into the Hands of the blessed Je∣sus, and shall conclude this further Account of God's Dealing with me, with a Hymn composed by my dear and honoured Friend Mr. <HI>Wesley.</HI></P>
