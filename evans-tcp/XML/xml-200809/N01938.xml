<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N this Chapter the Prophet <HI>Jere∣miah</HI> threatens the <HI>Jews</HI> with the Babylonish Captivity. He Ex∣horts ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Repentance, if by any means the threatned Judg¦ment might be prevented. The Exhortation is given to them in the former part of this Verse▪ <HI>O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e saved, i. e.</HI> Not only Temporally, but also Spiritually and Eternally.

calls them to, is proper for the Salvation of both. He then Expostulates with them about harbour∣ing such Thoughts in their breast which might be an Obstruction to their Repentance and Sal∣vation, <HI>How long shall thy Vain Thoughts lodge within thee?</HI> These <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> might be their thoughts of having Assistance from other Nations, whereby to secure them against the King of <HI>Babylon.</HI> Or their Thoughts might be, that there was to need of washing their hearts from Wickedness, as the Prophet here Exhorts them; for they were an Hypocritical Nation, <HI>Isa.</HI> 10.6 A People not concerned about heart-purity, but contenting themselves with the bare external Performance of Worship. Or their Thoughts might be that them was no Danger of the Desolation threatned, see∣ing they had the Temple of GOD, and Ordi∣nances of His Worship, in the midst of them Jer. 7.4. <HI>Trust ye not in lying Words, saying, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Tem∣ple of the Lord are these.</HI> They were apt to think that GOD would never suffer the Babylonians to Demolish that magnificent House, which was built by His own special Direction, and which He had Honoured with the Tokens of His Glo∣rious Presence, and which was the stated place of His Holy Worship. Some such Thoughts as these they had, which the Prophet declares to be <HI>Vain Thoughts,</HI> that would meet with Disappoint∣ment at the last, and that were for the present an impediment unto their attending the Right Method for securing their Salvation.

<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> THERE are Vain Thoughts in the Hearts of Sinners which are Great Hindrances of their being Saved.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> here intended, are the common cause of vain confidence, carnal securi∣ty and false hopes, which prove the ruin of Mul∣titudes under the Gospel. A desire of Happiness is natural to every Man. Nevertheless, the gene∣rality of Christians do finally miss of Happiness. And if we make diligent search we shall find that some <HI>Vain Thought,</HI> or other, is the great cause thereof. Their <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> do frustrate and de∣feat their desires, and render them altogether in∣effectual to Salvation. It may then be exceeding useful to point out these <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> and show how greatly they do hinder our Salvation; and also discover the Vanity of them, that so we may no longer suffer them to lodge in our hearts. The heart of Man is so great a deep, so deceitful and desperately Wicked that 'tis impossible to enu∣merate all those <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> which dwell therein. Yet from the Word of GOD (which gives the clearest discovery of Man's heart, and in so doing evidences its Divine Original) we may come to the Knowledge of a great many of these <HI>Vain Thoughts.</HI> I shall set some of them before you under these following Heads, with all possible plainness.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THERE are Vain Thoughts in the hearts of Sinners</HI> concerning <HI>GOD, which are great hindran∣ces of their being Saved.</HI> Sinners oftentimes form such vain Conceptions of GOD in their Minds as
<PB N="4" REF="002302_0004_0FDB1C839FE183A8"/>
prove ruinous to their Souls. They imagine GOD to be such a one as He really is not. And these false imaginations do greatly tend to their Destruction. To Instance here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is a Vain Thought, That GOD is ignoran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of any of the Sins of Men.</HI> Such a Thought as thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> there is oftentimes in the Hearts of Sinners. They think that GOD does not see and know their Sins Psal. 94.6, 7 <HI>They stay the Widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless. Yet they say, the Lord shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.</HI> E¦specially are Sinners apt to think, That GOD does not see their secret Sins. Isa 29.15. <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say▪ who seeth us? and who knoweth us</HI>? Ezek 8.1: <HI>Then said he unto me, Son of Man, hast thou se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what the Ancients of Israel do in the dark, every ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Chambers of his Imagery? for they say the Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth us not.</HI> Now such a Thought as this is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great hindrance of Mens being Saved; for it tend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to harden them in Sin, and to make them bold i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sinning, especially in secret. If they think GOD is not acquainted with, or takes no Notice of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> secret Sins, why should they be afraid to Sin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> secret? No Eye of Man sees them, and if GOD does not see them, what should restrain them Thus do they suppose secrecy to be a security <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them But the Vantiy of this Thought may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seen in a few Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>GOD is an I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>finite Being, and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ry where present.</HI> The Lisence of GOD is wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all bounds or limits; and therefore He car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not be confined to any place 1 King 8.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>of Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="5" REF="002302_0004_0FDB1C839FE183A8"/>
contain thee.</HI> The vast Heavens do not inclose GOD. He is not only there; but also every where else, so as that 'tis impossible to find any place from whence GOD is excluded, Psal. 139.7, 8, 9. <HI>Whither shall I free from thy presence? If I ascend up into Heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in Hell, behold thou art there. If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the Sea; even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy Right hand shall hold me.</HI> Let us go where we will, GOD is there; and therefore the most se∣cret place cannot conceal us from GOD. Jer. 23.24. <HI>Can any Man hide himself in secret places, that I shall not see him? saith the Lord. Do I n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Heaven and Earth? saith the Lord</HI> What can an Omnipresent GOD be a Stranger to? What Sin can be hid from Him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD is One of Infinite Understanding, and there∣fore knows every thing.</HI> The Understanding of GOD has no bounds of Perfection; but is Infinitely Perfect, Psal. 147.5. <HI>His Understanding is Infinite.</HI> There are no limits can be set to it. And con∣sequently there can be nothing excluded from His Knowledge. If there were any thing which GOD did not know, His Knowledge would be imperfect, and defective and finite. 'Tis certain then that GOD knows all things that are done by Men He sees and knows what ever they do in the darkest recesses and retirements. Psal 139.11, 12. <HI>If I s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y surely the darkness shall cover me, even the Night shall be light about me. Yea, the dark∣ness h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>deth not from thee, but the Night shineth as the Day: The darkness and the light we both a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ike to thee.</HI> Nay, The very hearts of Men, which are far more undiscernable than the darkest places,
<PB N="6" REF="002302_0005_0FDB1C84A7AA82B0"/>
are yet perfectly known by the Great GOD. 1 King. 8.39. <HI>For thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the Children of Men.</HI> There is not so much as a <HI>Thought</HI> in the heart, but GOD know∣eth it. Psal. 139.2. <HI>Thou understandest my thought afar off.</HI> In short, <HI>All the ways of Man are before the eyes of the Lord; and he pondereth all his goings,</HI> Prov. 5.21, Job 34.21. <HI>There is no Creature that is not manifest in his sight; but all things are naked, and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do,</HI> Heb. 4.13. What Sin then is it that GOD does not know?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>GOD will Judge the World in Righteousness, and there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must know all the Sins of Men.</HI> GOD has appointed a Day wherein He will Judge all Men: And the Judge of the whole Earth will in that Day do Right, Gen. 18.25. <HI>He will then render to every man according to his deeds,</HI> Rom. 2.6. The Reward shall be according to what the na∣ture and quality of their works have been. 2 Cor. 5.10. <HI>For we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</HI> Those that have done well, shall be well-rewarded, and those that have done ill, shall be ill-rewarded, and both of them proportionable to the good or evil they have done. Now GOD cannot thus exactly recompence Men, unless He have a full, perfect and distinct knowledge of their Deeds. As sure then as GOD is a just Judge, so sure is it that He knows all the Sins of Men, even those that are the most secret: And accordingly we are informed that GOD in the last and great Day, will set the Sins of Men in order before their eyes. Eccl. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 14. <HI>God shall bring every work
<PB N="7" REF="002302_0005_0FDB1C84A7AA82B0"/>
into Judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or evil.</HI> In that Day the most concealed ini∣quities of Men shall be laid open to the view of the whole World. 1 Cor. 4.5. <HI>Therefore Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will bring to light the hidden things of darkness.</HI></P>
<P>FROM these things then it is evident, That the thought of GOD's being ignorant of any of the Sins of Men, is a <HI>Vain Thought</HI>; a Thought that has no Truth in it; no real foundation for it, and that will deceive us if we promise our selves any advantage from it. Well then, let not such a <HI>Vain Thought</HI> as this lodge is our hearts; but let us keep up the contrary Thought in our hearts. Let us for ever keep it in the imagination of the Thought of our hearts, that GOD seeth all our ways, and counteth all our steps. That His eyes are in every place beholding the Evil and the Good. That if we do evil at any time, in the most retired Apartment, yet we do it in the sight of GOD. Such a Thought at this lodging in our hearts, would be a Thought of exceeding great Service and Advantage to us. This would help to make us watchful and circumspect; to pre∣vent a great many Sins which we may be tempted unto. The setting the Lord always before us, is one of the greatest preservatives from Sin, especially from secret Sins: It is also a good Sign of an heart that is upright with GOD; for none but such have GOD much in their eye. So much for the first <HI>Vain thought</HI> concerning GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought. <HI>That GOD is so Mer∣ciful as not to destroy Men for their Sins.</HI> Sometimes
<PB N="8" REF="002302_0006_0FDB1C894BD56370"/>
Men have in their hearts such a Thought con∣cerning GOD as this is: They imagine Him to be such a merciful GOD as they would have Him to be; a GOD all made op of Mercy, that wont take vengeance for Sin. Are not Persons sometimes heard to say? <HI>That GOD is more Merci∣ful than to damn His Creatures.</HI> And is there not the same secret imagination in the hearts of multi∣tudes of Sinners? They take up such a motion of Divine Mercy, as if it would suffer none to Perish in a miserable Destruction. They magni∣fy and extol the Mercy of GOD; and set it forth to themselves as a perfection that will infallibly secure them from Damnation. When they would flatter themselves, then they cry up the Infinite∣ness of Divine Mercy. Now such a thought as this is a great hindrance of Mens being Saved. This tends to make them go on securely in Sin, and be fearless of Damnation: This makes them to think that they may lead wicked lives, and yet that all shall be well at the last: That Mer∣cy will prevent their Damnation, and secure their Salvation. This thought is a <HI>Vain Thought</HI>; a thought which won't answer our expectations nor afford us that safety which we promise to ourselves.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE Vanity of this Thought may be sees under these following Heads,</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is granted that GOD is a most merciful GOD.</HI> Thus far the Thought of Sinners is Right; and it is their Duty to entertain such a thought of GOD in their hearts. We are to believe that GOD is <HI>abundant in Mercy,</HI> for so He hath revealed Himself unto us to be. Psal 86.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Thou, O
<PB N="9" REF="002302_0006_0FDB1C894BD56370"/>
Lord, art a God full of compassion and gracious, long-suffering ann plentious in Mercy.</HI> This Attribute of Divine Mercy lay hid in GOD until after the A∣postacy of Men. Then GOD gave a Glorious discovery of it in the First Promise of the Seed of the Woman. And afterwards GOD more ful∣ly and distinctly revealed the exceeding greatness of His Mercy, <HI>Exod.</HI> 34.6, 7. The Glory of it shines forth throughout the Holy Scriptures, where∣in in it is declared to be Infinite and Incomprehen∣sible. We cannot then form in our Minds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oo great an Idea of it, nor entertain too High &amp; Ho∣nourable Thoughts of it. 'Tis a vile reflection upon the Mercy of GOD, to have low and mean Conceptions of it. This is one thing which makes the Sin of Despair to be so great a Sin. It disbe∣lieves the Infiniteness of Divine Mercy, looking upon Sin greater than can be forgiven. As if the Sin of Man Exceeded the Mercy of GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THO' GOD be most Merciful, yet He is so only to the Repenting Sinner.</HI> Sinners in general are not the Objects of Divine Mercy. GOD does not shew Mercy to all Sinners; but only to such to whom He has promised to shew Mercy. Now GOD's Promises of Mercy are made only to Pe∣nitent Sinners. Prov. 28.13. <HI>Whoso confesseth and forsaketh Sin, shall find Mercy.</HI> Isa. 55.7. <HI>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him return to the Lord, and be will have Mercy upon him.</HI> Repentance is made the con∣dition of finding Mercy, and obtaining Forgiveness. If Sinners perform this condition, they may be confident of Mercy; but if they fail of Repent∣ing, they will assuredly miss of Mercy. Pardon∣ing
<PB N="10" REF="002302_0007_0FDB1C8AACFC8A60"/>
Mercy &amp; Salvation are confined to Repent∣ing and broken hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed Sinners. 'Tis therefore meer Presumption for any other Sinners to hope for Mercy from the Lord. Devils may as well expect it as they.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>DIVINE Mercy will be so far from saving im∣penitent Sinners, as tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t will make their Damnation the greater.</HI> Tho' Sinners promise themselves that GOD's Mercy will be for them, yet they will find it will be against them; it will be so far from standing up for them as a Friend, that it will be turned to be their Enemy. It will be so far from exempting them from Punishment, that it will bring upon them the forest of Punishments. This will be evident if we consider this one thing, <HI>viz</HI> While Sinners continue in Sin, thinking that Divine Mercy will save them notwithstanding, they are Guilty of the vilest abuse of the Mercy of GOD: For hereby they make the Mercy of GOD an Encouragement to Sin; and look upon it as that which will afford them protection in their wicked ways. Now is not this a most hor∣rid Reflection upon the Mercy of GOD, to sup∣pose that it will shield Men from Justice, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they persist in wickedness? Is not this to make the Merciful GOD a Patron, and Friend and Fa∣vourer of Sin? Certainly it is. And will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this provoke the very Mercy of GOD to Arm h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> self against such Sinners? Certainly it will. To such Sinners as these, that place of Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipture i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> applicable. Isa 27 11. <HI>It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a people of no under∣standing; therefore he that ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e them, will not hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mercy in them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d he that formed them will shes th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u no favour.</HI> Tho' they are His Creatures, the
<PB N="11" REF="002302_0007_0FDB1C8AACFC8A60"/>
Works of His hands, yet He will extend no fa∣vour to them. Nay, so far will He be from shewing them any favour, that He will bring Wrath upon them to the uttermost. Instead of their being made Monuments of His Mercy, as they expect; they shall be made the most tre∣mendious Monuments of His Vindictive Justice. Such ungodly Men as thus turn the Grace &amp; Mer∣cy of GOD into Laciviousness, by making them to countenance their vile Practices, are Men to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for∣ever, <HI>Jude</HI> v. 4, 13. Extremity and Eternity of Misery will be their Portion at the last.</P>
<P>WE see then, from what has been said, That the thought of GOD's being Merciful to us tho' we persist in Sin, is a <HI>Vain Thought</HI> which will deceive us. Let not then such a <HI>Vain Thought</HI> as this lodge within us, let it not be cherished by us. On the other hand, Let us take up and main∣tain <HI>Right Thoughts</HI> of the Mercy of GOD. Let us think that the Mercy of GOD is a great induce∣ment and encouragement unto Repentance and Reformation; Thus it is represented to us in the Scriptures; and thus it is to be apprehended by us▪ Joel 2.13. <HI>Rent your Heart and not your Garment, and turn unto the Lord your God; for he is gracious and merciful, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w to anger and of great kindness, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>penteth him of the evil.</HI> GOD's being a Gracious and Merciful GOD, is an attracting Argument and Motive to Repentance. It is enough to melt an ingenious Spirit into Tears for its Sins against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o good a GOD; and to give him the greatest Encouragement to return to GOD by unfeigned Repentance. O let us make such a genuine use
<PB N="12" REF="002302_0008_0FDB1C8C25912060"/>
and improvement of the Merciful Nature and Disposition of the Great GOD. Let us think and say within our selves. <HI>Shall we Sin against GOD because He is a Merciful GOD? Shall we deshonour Him, and offer indignity to Him because He is G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Gracious? far be it from us thus to do. How base▪ how vile a treatment is this! His Mercy shall not ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣den us, but soften as: His Mercy shall not embolde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us in Sin, but lead us to Repentance for Sin. He Proclamation of Mercy shall cause us humbly to com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unto Him and Accept of His Pardon for Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s sake; and it shall engage us for ever to lay down the weapon of our Rebellion, and to abide Faithful in His Service.</HI> This is the right use which is to be made of the Mercy of GOD; and if thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be made of it, we shall then find that GOD will Mercifully for∣give us our Sins, tho' they have been never so many and so great. His Mercy will then secure us from the strokes of incensed Justice; so as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not the least Punishment shall be inflicted upon us for our Sins, though they have deserved th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Damnation of Hell a thousand and a thousan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> times. The kind Reception that we may then ex∣pect to find from a gracious GOD, is most live¦lily represented to us in the Instance of peniten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Ephraim,</HI> Jer. 31.18, 19, 20. <HI>I have surely heard E¦phraim bemoaning himself thus, thou hast chastised us and I was chastised; as a Bullock unaccustomed to il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ke; turn thou me and I shall be turned, for the art the Lord my God.

<HEAD>THUS much for the <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> of Sinners concerning GOD.</HEAD>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THERE are</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>in the hearts of Sinners concerning the</HI> Providence of GOD, <HI>which are great hindrances of their being Saved.</HI> GOD who made all things, does exercise a Providence over them all. He unholds, governs and disposes of all Creatures. Now Sinners, tho' they may not deny the Providence of GOD; yet they entertain <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> concerning some acts of Divine Pro∣vidence, which do much hinder and endanger their Salvation. I shall here Instance only in two of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is a Vain Thought, That because GOD in His Providence, exercises Patience towards Sinners, there∣fore He will never punish them for their Sins.</HI> It is the usual way of GOD to be patient towards Sinners: He does not presently punish them; nay, oftentimes suffers them to go a long time unpunished. He not only exercises Forbearance towards them, but also long-suffering, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.4. Now, Sinners hereupon are apt to think that they shall always go unpunished. They inter∣pret the Patience of GOD as an evidence of per∣petual impunity. Because GOD suspends the in∣fliction of Punishment, they conclude He will totally exempt them from Punishment. Yea, They are apt to think, that He is not offended at their Sins; but rather likes well enough of them, as they do themselves. Psal. 50.21. <HI>These things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> done▪ and I kept silence. i.e.</HI> I was provi∣dentially
<PB N="14" REF="002302_0009_0FDB1C8D9EAEA510"/>
silent not testifying against thy Sins in a way of Punishment. Then it follows, <HI>Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> self.</HI> Now, Such a Thought as this is a great impediment in the way of Sinners Salvation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tends to make them careless about Repentance and fleeing from the Wrath to come. If GOD will always let them alone, as they think He will they may then hold on in their evil ways. Eccl 8.11. <HI>Because sentence against an evil work is not exe∣cuted speedily; therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</HI> But such a though as this which is lodged in them, is a <HI>Vain Though</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Vain Thought,</HI> that a Patient GOD was not be a Sin-punishing GOD. Divine Patience yields no ground for such an imagination. The Vanity of this Thought may be seen from what follows.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE primary Intention of GOD in everlasting Patience towards Sinners, is that they might Repent▪</HI> While GOD is Patient, He expects that Sinner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should prove themselves Penitent. Such is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Infinite goodness of GOD, that He desires not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Death of Sinners; but had rather that they shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> turn and live. And for this end, He does not immediately destroy them for their Sins, as li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might most justly do; but gives them time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consider of their evil doings and Repent thereof 2 Pet. 3.9. <HI>The Lord is long suffering to us w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll not willing that any should perish, but that all shoul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> come to repentance.</HI> The Day of His Patience, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a designed space for Repentance. Rev. 2.21. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gave her space to Repent of her Fornication. An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore the Day of Divine Patience, is attende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Means of Repentance, and calls t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="15" REF="002302_0009_0FDB1C8D9EAEA510"/>
Repentance. GOD is therein graciously inviting them to Repent and turn to Himself, Rom. 10.21. <HI>All the Day long have I stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gain saving people.</HI> In this way GOD is waiting upon them, that He may be gra∣cious to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IF Divine Patience be not improved to Repen∣tance, it will issue in their most dreadful Destruction.</HI> The Patience of GOD will not last always. It will sooner or later come to an and: And the end of it will be terrible to impenitent Sinners. It shall not then be will with them as they imagine; but <HI>id</HI> beyond all possible imagination. Eccl. 8. 12, 13. <HI>Though a Sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged — Yet it shall not be well with the wicked.</HI> When GOD's Patience is expi∣red, it shall be far from being well with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. More is intended than expressed. It means that it shall be exceeding ill with them. And in other places of Scripture, it is plainly declared how a∣stonishingly great their Punishment will be. <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.4, 5 <HI>Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, for∣bearance and long-suffering, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> knowing that the good∣ness of God leadeth thee to Repentence? But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up unto thy self wrath against the Day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous Judgment of God.</HI> All the time of GOD's Patience, impenitent Sinners are treasu∣ring up wrath; and the longer the Day of GOD's Patience is, the greater Treasures of wrath are they laying up for themselves. When Sinners are Impenitent under much <HI>Long-suffering,</HI> they are <HI>Vessels of Wrath</HI> fitted for amazing Destructi∣on, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9 22. The longer they are spared, the more are their sins multiplied and aggravated,
<PB N="16" REF="002302_0010_0FDB1C8F2F823758"/>
and consequently the greater will be their Dam∣nation. The measure of Wrath will be according to the measure of Sin. The longer therefore Men have lived in Sin, the more heavy will their Pu∣nishment be at the last. So far then is the For∣bearance of GOD from being an Evidence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Future impunity, as that it prepares a way fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the largest Vials of Divine Wrath to be poure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out on obstinate Sinners.</P>
<P>WELL then, Let us not be so Vain as to think That because GOD spares us for a time, He will therefore spare us always, tho' we continue in Sin▪ Let us not thus abuse the Patience of GOD unt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Impenitency. But on the other hand, let us fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in with the Gracious design of GOD's Patience by a speedy Repentance. Let us no longer har∣den our hearts, but hearken unto His Voice while the Day of His Patience lasts. Let us think how great a Favour of GOD it is, that His Pa∣tience with us is not yet at an end, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there is yet room for Repentance &amp; reconciliation to GOD. He might have cut us down, as He be done many others, not greater Sinners than ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> selves. Since then we are continued to have out¦standing in the Lord's Vineyard, let us answe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the expectations of GOD, by bringing for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the fruits of Unfaigned Repentance, then sha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Long-suffering of GOD prove Salvatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to us.</P>
<P>THUS much for the first Vain Though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> concerning the Providence of GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT is a Vain Thought that because GOD i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> His Providence Outwar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Prospers Men, therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

bears a special Affection to them.</HI> How common is it for Men to bless themselves on the account of their Worldly Prosperity? How ready are they to conclude that GOD must needs greatly love them because He so greatly Prospers them? If He bestows upon them Riches and Honours, and Health beyond what He does to others, they suppose themselves to be the peculiar favourites of GOD. Surely, think they, If GOD had not a singular favour for us, He would not so smile upon us in His Providence. Such a Thought as this is a great Hindrance to Men's Salvation; for it tends to make Men secure in Sin, and so rest satisfyed with their present Spi∣ritual Condition, tho' it be not good. The Out∣ward favourable Dispensations of Providence to∣wards them, makes them think that all is as well as needs be: But this is a Vain Thought, as will appear from two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE</HI> Greatest <HI>Outward Prosperity is not in it self an evidence of GOD</HI>'s <HI>Special Love.</HI> This is what GOD has testifyed to us that we might not thereby miss judge of our selves. Eccl. 9.1, 2. <HI>No man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them; all things come alike to all, there is one event to the Righteous, and to the Wicked,</HI> &amp;c. Prosperous and Adverse Providences are Common to good and bad, and therefore by them alone no Man can know whether he be an Object of the Love, or of the Hatred of GOD. Nay, oftentimes the worst of Men, those that are most abhorred of the Lord, are the most Prosperous Men, as to this World. Jer. 12.7. <HI>Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? Wherefore are all they happy
<PB N="18" REF="002302_0011_0FDB1C90F19F6E20"/>
that deal very treacherously</HI>? Psal 73.3, 12. <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wicked. Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the World, they increase in riches.</HI> Nay, some∣times GOD gives <HI>Vast Kingdoms</HI> to the <HI>worst</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Men. Dan. 4.17. <HI>The Most High <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>leth in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Kingdom of Men, and giveth it to whoesoever b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will, and setteth up over it the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asest of Men.</HI> Not of the basest Spirits, and basest Lives, are for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most part set up over the Kingdoms of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> World. The Holy Scriptures and the Record<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of all Ages do abundantly confirm this for a tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> It is then a Vain Thought to think that Prospe¦rity, tho' never so great, is an Infallible Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of GOD's Special Love.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>PROSPERITY is oftentimes granted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Men, not in Love, but in Truth.</HI> So far is Prospe¦rity from being always a fruit and token <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD's Special Love, that it is often a fruit and token of His dreadful Wrath. He grant Prosperity sometimes in Judgment, and not it Mercy: it is many times a Curse of GOD and not a Blessing to Men. The good thing of this World are many times denied to Men in love, and many times given to them in wrath Psal. 78.29, 30, 31. <HI>So they did eat and were filled for he gave them their own desire: but while the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meat was yet in thier Mouths, the wrath of God can upon them.</HI> Prosperity is many times accompa¦nied with a Divine Curse, so as to prove a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to Men's Souls, and an occasion of their eterna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> destruction. Prov. 1.32. <HI>The prosperity of fools she destroy them.</HI> It does but fat them for the slaugh¦ter and ripen them for ruine.

us not think that the liberality of GOD dispen∣sed to us in Providence is an Infallible Sign of His Special Favour for us. Let us not flatter our selves with such a Vain Imagination, that be∣cause GOD opens His bountiful hand to us, therefore we lye near His Heart, and are most dear unto Him. Bare Prosperity affords no solid foundation for such a conclusion. I say <HI>bare</HI> or <HI>meer</HI> Prosperity; for Prosperity considered in its Circumstances, may be to a Man a token for Good, and an Evidence of the Fatherly care and kindness of GOD. And it is so, when Pros∣perity comes in a way of Honesty and Prayer, when it is enjoyed with a Spirit of Humility, and a sense of Unworthiness of it, when it is made an effectual Motive to Love and Serve GOD, when it is moderately used for our own present Comfort, and readily employed for the Good and Benefit of others in ways of Beneficence and Charity. Prosperity thus circumstanced may be looked upon as an Argument of Divine Love; by this we may know that GOD has a Favour for us. Let us then he concerned that our Pros∣perous Circumstances, may always carry along with them such Indications of the Love of GOD to us, as of a Father to his Children. When it is a Day of such Prosperity with us we may then most reasonably be joyful, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 7.14.</P>
<P>THUS for the <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> of Sinners concern▪ in the Providence of GOD; which was a second sort of <HI>Vain Thoughts.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>THERE are</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>in the hearts of Sinners concerning</HI> Jesus Christ, <HI>which are great

Hindrances of their being Saved.</HI> They do some¦times entertain such thoughts concerning the v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Saviour Himself, as do hinder their being Sav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> by Him. I shall name only two of them, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> show their Variety.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought <HI>That</HI> Jesus Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>save Men from Wrath, though they Live in Sin.</HI> Sin¦ners are apt to look open Jesus Christ as a deli¦verer only from the Wrath to come. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such a one they accept of Him and are willing to be Saved by Him. They cry up the Infinit∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Vertue of His most Precious Blood, as that which is sufficient to Cleanse them from the Guilt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all their Sins, and to save them from the Damna¦tion of Hell. And thus they please themselve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the all sufficiency and abundant Merit of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Blood of Christ, and hope to be Saved on the Account thereof, though they continue in Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Such a thought as this makes Men look upon Re¦pentance for Sin, the Mortification of Lusts an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Reformation of Life, to be needless things. An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so it is an Obstruction to the Salvation of Men Souls, as it puts them by from those things whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are necessary to Salvation. This thought then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a most pernicious thought, and also as vain as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is pernicious The Vanity of it will be se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from these things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>TO suppose that</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>will save M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from Wrath, though they Live in Sin, is to suppose th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Christ is a Minister of Sin.</HI> Such a supposition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this is most vain and impious. The Apostle re¦jects such an imagination with the greatest ab¦horrence and indignation, Gal. 2.17 <HI>Is Jes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="21" REF="002302_0012_0FDB1C97E3026318"/>
Christ the Minister of Sin? God forbid.</HI> 'Tis horrid Blasphemy to suppose Christ to be a countenancer and abettor of Sin. For He is one that <HI>Loveth Righteousness, and hateth Iniquity,</HI> Heb. 1 9. But now, such as think that Christ will save them from Hell, though they spend their Days in Sin, do make Christ a conniver at Sin, and an approver of it. They represent Him as One that undertakes to secure them from harm, tho' they go on in their Trespasses to the end. They represent Him as One that died to procure for them a liberty to Sin with impunity. How does this reproach the Holy One of Israel!</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>'TIS most certain that the great end of Christ's Coming into the World, was to save Men from their Sins.</HI> For this reason was the Name <HI>Jesus</HI> given to Him, <HI>Because he should save his People from their Sins,</HI> Matth. 1.21. The Great Work of Jesus Christ was to save from Sin. Sin is the greatest of evils, and therefore the main design of Jesus Christ was to save from Sin. This was His chief errand into the World, 1 Joh. 3.5, 8. <HI>And ye know that he was manifested to take away our Sins. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the Devil.</HI> Sin is the special work of the Devil, and this work Christ in a peculiar manner came to destroy. The Devil had set up the Dominion of Sin in our Hearts; and Jesus Christ came to deliver us from this Cur∣sed Dominion. He came not to establish the reign of Sin in us, but to overthrow it, and set us at Liberty therefrom. Tit. 2.14. <HI>Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity.</HI> So far was Christ from coming to save Men <HI>in</HI> their
<PB N="22" REF="002302_0013_0FDB1C99AFCF2A90"/>
Sins, that He came to save them <HI>from</HI> their Sin And if Christ be not our Saviour from Sin, in vain do we expect▪ that He will be our Saviour from the Wrath to come. Salvation from Sin and Wrath are inseparable.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>IT is also to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that the Death of Christ fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sin, is one of the greatest Motives to abstinence from Sin.</HI> In Christ's Dying for Sin, we have the clear¦est Discovery of the heinous nature of Sin and its hatefulness unto the Holy GOD. Therei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we may see, that Sin was so great an Evil, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nothing could make Expiation or Attonement fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it, but the Sacrifice of the Son of GOD Himself▪ Therein we may see GOD's hatred of Sin to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such, as that He spared not His own Sea, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> He stood under the imputation of it. The E∣ternal burnings of Hell, in which Damned Sin∣ners are Punished, do not give such a Demonstra∣tion of the Lord's abhorring Sin, as the suffer∣ings and Death of His Son, for our sins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Since then the Death of Christ on the Cross fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sin, does afford such an evident Manifestation of the exceeding greatness of the evil of Sin, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should then fill us with the greatest hatred of Sin The design of GOD in giving us any way a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h of the evil of Sin, is, that we might be move to hate it, and flee from it. When therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> He gives us the most hideous prospect of Sin evil, in the Glass of Christ's sufferings and Death He expects that we should thereby be induce to fear Sin and forsake it. Such then as m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Christ's Death for Sin, an Argument for conti¦nuing in Sin, are guilty of a most vile abused the Death of Christ They make that a Motiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="23" REF="002302_0013_0FDB1C99AFCF2A90"/>
to hold on in Sin, which in its own Nature, and in the intention of GOD and CHRIST, is the greatest Motive to a Total and Eternal ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣doning of Sin.</P>
<P>FROM these things then it is clear, That Men do but in vain hope that Christ will save them from the Damnation of Hell, tho' they abide un∣der the power and practise of Sin. Let us not then entertain such a <HI>Vian Thought</HI> in our hearts. But on the other hand, let us think▪ and say to our selves thus; <Q>If I am not saved from Sin▪ I must infallibly Perish for ever. If I die in my Sins, Jesus Christ will be so far from sa∣ving me from Destruction, that with His own Mouth He will condemn, and sentence me to Hell; and with His own hand will cast me down into the Pit, from whence there is no Redemption. Instead of being a gracious De∣liverer, He will be a terrible Judge and Aven∣ger to me. Let me then look to Christ to be a <HI>whole Saviour</HI> unto me; to save me from Sin here, and from Wrath hereafter. In thus doing, I may hope to find Mercy with Him now and in the Day of His Glorious appearing to Judge the World.</Q></P>

<HEAD>THUS for the first <HI>Vain Thought</HI> concerning <HI>JESUS CHRIST.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That Christians need <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, obey the Law of GOD, therefore Jesus Christ has perfectly obeyed it for them</HI> It is the opinion of some, that Christ's compleat Obedience to the Law of GOD, in the place and stead of Belie∣vers,
<PB N="24" REF="002302_0014_0FDB1C9B28DC3098"/>
makes their Obedience to it needless. They think this exempts Christians from any Obligation to keep the Commandments of GOD. Christ by fulfilling it for Christians, has thereby, they sup∣pose, abrogated it, so that now Obedience to it is not required. Such a thought as this is a great hindrance of Men's Salvation; for it makes them neglect Duty, and look upon themselves as Law, less Persons, that are at Liberty to Live as they List; but such a thought as this is most abomi∣nable and vain. The Libertine will find this his Imagination a meer Delusion in the latter end.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THE Vanity of this Thought appears from what follows,</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is most true, That Christ by His perfect Obe∣dience to the Law of GOD for Believers, has freed them from the Law as it is a Covenant of Life.</HI> To be under the Law as a Covenant of Life is this <HI>viz.</HI> If a Man keep the Law perfectly then He shall Live, if He breaks it by the least Sin that He shall Die. For the Covenant of Works it <HI>Do this and Live,</HI> Gal. 3.12. <HI>Do not, and Dye</HI> Gen. 2.17. Now thus a Christian is not under the Law. Believers are not bound to yield per¦fect, personal Obedience to the Law of GOD in order to the obtaining Eternal Life. And th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reason hereof is, because Jesus Christ as thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Surety has perfectly obeyed the Law for them He has yielded an absolutely perfect and sinles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Obedience to the Law of GOD in their stead and therefore GOD does not now require it o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them as necessary unto their Salvation. GOD accepts of Christ's perfect Obedience for them
<PB N="25" REF="002302_0014_0FDB1C9B28DC3098"/>
and so does not exact perfect Obedience from them, in their own Persons, as the condition of Eternal Life. In this sense it is said that Be∣lievers are not under the Law. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.14. <HI>For ye are not under the Law. i. e.</HI> as a Covenant of Works. If they were under the Law as such a Covenant, it would be impossible for them to be Saved. For they cannot possibly fulfil the Terms of that Covenant, which requires Obedience in the highest degree of Perfection.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THO' Christians are freed from the Law as a Covenant of Works; yet they are under the Law as a Rule of Life.</HI> GOD's Holy Law always was, is and will be a Rule of Life and Obedience to Men, even in Heaven it self. Matth. 6.10. <HI>Thy Will be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.</HI> 'Tis the Duty of all to square their Lives ac∣cording to this Rule. Believers themselves, tho' Christ has fulfilled the Law for them as a Cove∣nant of Works, are yet bound to walk by the Law as a rule. They are called upon to lead Holy, Righteous, Sober Lives; to be full of Good Works. Now, nothing is Holy, Just and Good, but what is conformed to the Holy, Just and Good Law of GOD. The Law then is a Rule to them which they should be careful to observe in all things. Nay, were not Believers under the Law of GOD as a Rule of their Lives, it were not possible for them to Sin; for Sin is a Transgression of the Law. If it be not a Law to them, they cannot be Guilty of any Crimi∣nal Breach of it; but their Sins are many, <HI>Jam.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.2.</P>

<P N="4">4. <HI>THERE are</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>in the hearts of Sinners concerning Sin, which are great hindrances of their being Saved.</HI> They take up such appre∣hensions of Sin as make them more easily to venture upon the Commission of it, and more indifferent about the Repenting of it.

<P N="1">1. <HI>'TIS a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That Heart Sins are not Damning.</HI> This is the Thought of some Hy∣pocritical Persons, who are careful to avoid outward Sins; but are regardless of inwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Sins, <HI>Matth.</HI> 23.25. The Hypocrite is not upon his Watch and Guard against Heart-Sins, and yet he cherishes hopes of Heaven.

And thus in our Context GOD call upon <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI> to <HI>Wash their hearts from wickedness, that they might be saved.</HI> Thus also the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> Exhorts <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> Acts. 8.22. <HI>Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</HI> Heart-Sins then need forgiveness, and most be repented of in order to forgiveness.

<HEAD>THUS much for the first <HI>Vain Thought</HI> concerning Sin</HEAD>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That the Living in some single, gross actual Sin will not issue in Destruction.</HI> Such a Thought there oftentimes is in the hearts of Sinners. They think that if they in∣dulge themselves only in some one Sin, there is no danger of perishing thereby. They can't think that GOD will shut them out of Heaven; and cast them down to Hell, for the Reserve of one Sin. Did they live in many Sins, then they sup∣pose the end thereof will be Death: But when 'tis no more than a single Sin, which they ac∣custom themselves unto, they don't imagine that this will end in their Damnation. Such an imagination as this there is sometimes in the Hearts of Sinners, or else the Holy Ghost would not in the Scriptures so solemnly caution us a∣gainst it, as we shall presently shew He does. Now this imagination is a vain imagination, as will appear from these things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>ONE Act of heinous Sin has oftentimes issued in the Destruction of Sinners, much more will the custo∣mary practice of it.</HI> In the Word of GOD, we have many recorded Instances of such as have been smitten with Death, and sent down to Hell, for one gross act of Sin, whereby the Holy GOD

Consequently if an <HI>Act</HI> of Sin brings De¦struction on Men, much more will a <HI>Course</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sin do so. He that goes on in the Commissi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of any kind of Sin, is certainly a far greater Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ner, and more worthy of Damnation; than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that is only once guilty of such a Sin.</P>

Intention would not excuse it. And therefore he does humbly acknowledge his Sin, and admire the Grace and Mercy of GOD in forgiving it. 1 Tim. 1.13. <HI>I was a blasphemer, and a per∣secutor, and injurious; but I obtained Mercy.</HI> From these things then we see that a good Intention is no sufficient excuse for Sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That the natural In∣clination to Sin, will excuse the Commission of Sin</HI> There is in the heart of every Man, a strange pro∣pensity to Sin. Fallen nature is powerfully b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s∣sed and bent to the doing Evil. Now this na∣tural proneness to Sin, Men are ape to suppos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> a sort of Apology for Sin. They are ready <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> say, <HI>'Tis natural to all Men to Sin. This is the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate and universal Inclination of Mankind; and Na∣ture will have its way.</HI> Such reasonings there are sometimes in the hearts of Sinners. But alas! the naturalness of Sin, is no Excuse for Sin.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THIS natural Inclination to Sin is a just ground of self-condemnation, and so cannot be a ground of so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> justification for Sin.</HI> Our Inclination to Sin is a part of the Corruption of our Nature, and a branch of that Cursed enmity against GOD that is in our hearts. It is said of the carnal Mind, that it is <HI>Enmity against God,</HI> Rom 8 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Now our great Inclination to Sin against GOD and oppose GOD, is a Principle part of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> horrid enmity. We have therefore cause <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> judge and condemn and abhor our selves in that there is in us such a principle of contra∣riety and opposition to GOD.

That then which calls for self-judging and self-abhorence cannot justly be made an Apology for our Sin. How can that excuse us for which we are bound to condemn our selves?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THIS Natural Inclination to Sin is an aggre∣vation of Sin, rather than an extenuation of it.</HI> It is so far from excusing or lessening the Sin, that it makes it the greater. The vicious inclination, makes the Sin proceeding from it, more vile and hateful. When <HI>David</HI> was penitently confessing his great Transgressions to GOD, he makes mention of the various aggravations of them, as they had been <HI>against GOD,</HI> and committed in the <HI>Sight of GOD,</HI> Yet he does not stop here, but follows his Sins up to their Fountain, even the Corruption of his Nature, Psal. 51.5. <HI>Behold I was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</HI> He mentions the Sin and pravity of Nature, not for his own Vindication; but for his greater Confusion and Abasement he produces it, not to justify himself, but to Justify GOD in Judging him; for that he had not only done such evil things, but had also such an evil heart in him, from whence they proceeded. Indwel∣ling Sin then, is no Plea <HI>for</HI> Sinners, but against them. If a Murderer should Plead his Bloody Disposition, and Murderous Inclination, would that excuse him and exempt him from Punish∣ment? Would it not rather make his speedy Execution more just and necessary? We see then, that Original Sin is no Excuse for Act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣al Sins.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="40" REF="002302_0022_0FDB1CB02002B3C0"/>3. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought. <HI>That Temptation to Sin will Excuse the Commission of Sin.</HI> In this World Men do meet with very many, and very gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Temptations to Sin, from the Devil and from Men. By these Temptations Men are oftentim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> carried away to the Commission of Sin. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Men are apt to make these Temptations a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Excuse for their Sins.

<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>TEMPTATION forces no Man to Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Tempters can do no more than intreat us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Arguments with us, propound Motives to us and when they have done all, they cannot con∣strain us to Sin.

Indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Men or Devils could offer violence to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wills and irresistably determine them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we were excusable.

Therefore Christ has directed us to seek unto GOD by Prayer, for his help against Temptations; Mat. 6.13. <HI>Lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us from evil.</HI> This shows that Divine Assistance is ten∣dred and may be obtained in the way of Prayer.

to Sin can promise to us, is only sensual Pleasure, Worldly Profits or Advancements.

This is the utmost that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e can promise, to win us to a compliance with his Temptations: But what, is all this World to the things which GOD promises to us, in case we resist Temptation? He has assured us that if we overcome, he will give us a Crown of Life, and Glory that fadeth not away, he will make us to sit upon Thrones, he will bestow up∣on us the Heavenly Inheritance, and make as to drink of those Rivers of Pleasure, that are at his Right Hand for evermore. These things are incomparable greater inducements to resist Temptation, than the other are to comply with Temptation. So thought <HI>Moses.</HI> Heb. 11.20. <HI>Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Aegypt: for he had respect unto the recompense of reward.</HI> If a Man therefore shall disregard GOD<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Offers, and take up with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> offers of Satan, is he not inexcusable? Had Men or Devils made better offers to them than GOD they might have some excuse for hearkening to Temptation. But since GOD does offer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them Infinitely better things, than any other do or can do, they are therefore without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> excuse for complying with Temptation to Sin.</P>
<P>FROM these things then it appears, that though Men's Temptations be never so many and so great, yet that will not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n sufficient excuse for their Commission of Sin.</P>

<P N="1"><PB N="45" REF="002302_0024_0FDB1CB322E7BEC8"/>1. <HI>THEIR Sins, thought very Holy Men, were exceeding offensive to GOD.</HI> The Great GOD who has made known to us what their Sins were, has as clearly made known to us His Holy Dis∣pleasure at them, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 11.27. <HI>The thing that David had done displeased the Lord.</HI> And to how high a degree He was displeased is awfully re∣presented in the following Chap. 9th, 10th, 11th Verses, <HI>Wherefore hast thou despised the Commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his fight? Thou hast killed Cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the Hittite with the sword; and hast taken his wife to be thy wife; and hast slain him with the sword of the Children of Ammon.

<P N="2">2. <HI>THEIR falls are recorded for our Admoni∣tion, not for imitation.</HI> The design of GOD in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anding down to us the Knowledge of their Sin, is that by them we might take warning, 1 Cor. 10.11. <HI>They are written for our Admonition, upon whom the ends of the World are come.</HI> They should be Cautions to us against Sin, and not Encouragements to Sin We ought to improve them to greater watchfulness against Sin, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot to a more presumptuous boldness in Sinning. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f such Great and Good Men were overtaken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Great Transgressions, the more need have we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o take heed to our selves, lest we fall. This
<PB N="46" REF="002302_0025_0FDB1CBB85514C30"/>
is the proper use we should make of such sad Instances of humane frailty. And 'tis a perverse abuse of them, to excuse our selves in Sin thereby.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>'TIS a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That danger of Suf∣fering will Excuse the Commission of Sin.</HI> The Case is many times so circumstanced, that Men must either do evil, or suffer evil. When this come to be their Case, they frequently commit Sin, that they may escape Sufferings. Thus in time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Persecution, many do Apostatize from the Profession of Religion for fear of Sufferings: And they are ready to think, that they may be excu¦sed for their Sin, when only a fear of Suffering was the inducement to it. But this is a Vai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thought, as appears from these things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE least Sin is a far worse Evil, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the greatest Sufferings.</HI> No Affliction whatsoever is comparably so great an Evil as Sin. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> wrongs GOD; but Suffering only hurts th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Creature. Sin wrongs the Soul, but Affliction hurts only the Body. Sin makes us hateful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD, Afflictions do not. Sin tends to no Goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but Afflictions may be greatly to our Profit So that Sin is much worse than any Affliction Nay, it is far worse than Death it self; 1 Cor. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 56. <HI>The Sting of Death is sin.</HI> 'Tis Sin that ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Death hurtful: Take away Sin, and the Death is unstung, and becomes an innocen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> harmless thing; yea a thing most sweet an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desirable We ought then to choose Suffering and Death, rather than Sin. Thus did <HI>Moses</HI> Heb. 11.25. <HI>Choosing rather to suffer affliction wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the People of God, than to enjoy the pleasure of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P N="2">2 <HI>BY Sinning we expose our Selves to much sorer Punishment than Men are capable of ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>.</HI> Sin exposes us to the Wrath of GOD, which is In∣finitely more dreadful than the Wrath of Man. <HI>It is a fearful thing to fall unto the hands of the living God,</HI> Heb. 10.31. He can destroy both Soul and Body in Hell forever, whereas Men can only Kill the Body, and that but for a time. The worst that Men are capable of doing to us, is but as nothing to what GOD can do. We have much more cause then to stand in Awe of GOD and not Sin, than thro' fear of Man to venture upon Sin. Fear should rather deter us from Sin, than drive us to Sin, seeing there is far greater danger in Committing Sin, than Abstaining from it.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>'TIS a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That Sin is excusable, because 'tis but little.</HI> 'Tis sometimes the Thought of Sinners, that there is no great matter in com∣mitting lesser sort of Sins. Hence they are sel∣dom, if ever, troubled for their supposed little Sins. They don't count them of such Moment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to call for Mourning and Humiliation before GOD, such peccadilloes, as they are termed; petty Oaths, little Thefts and Frauds and Surfeits, need not be laid to heart, and that GOD overlooks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem.

<P N="1">1. <HI>No Sin is in it self little.</HI> 'Tis true, that some Sins are far less than others, all Sins are not equal;
<PB N="48" REF="002302_0026_0FDB1CBC1890ECD8"/>
there are some Sins which are as Camels, and others which are as Gnats compared among themselves. Nevertheless, those Sins which are Comparatively little, are in themselves excee∣ding Great. The least Sin is against the Great and Glorious GOD; 'tis a Transgression of His Law, a Contempt of His Authority, a Re∣flection upon His Divine Majesty; and can that be really little, which is contrary to the most High GOD? In Truth, as Sin is against the Infinite GOD, so it is an Infinite Evil. The least Sin is objectively Infinite.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD has upon Pain of Death, forbidden little Sins as well as great.</HI> 'Tis true, That GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not threatned every Sin with a like measure o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Punishment. There will be different Degrees o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Punishment inflicted, according to the different Degrees of Sin. As every Sin is not alike h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦nous, so every Sin shall not be alike Punished Nevertheless, Death, Eternal Death, is threatne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the least Sin, as that which 'tis worthy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The smallest Transgression of the Law of GOD lays Men open to the Curse of the Law, Gal. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 10. <HI>Cursed is every one that continueth not in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> things that are written in the book of the Law to them.</HI> If the Law be not kept in an things, it be broken in any the least Degree, it bring Men under the Curse.

<P N="5">5. <HI>THERE are</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>in the hearts of Sinners concerning</HI> Repentance, <HI>which are great hindrances of their being Saved.</HI> These <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> respect either the season of Repentance, or the Nature and Truth of Repentance, or the Duty it self; and in all these Respects, their Thoughts are exceeding prejudicial to the Salvation of their Souls. <HI>e. g.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>'TIS a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That</HI> hereafter <HI>will be as proper a season for Repentance, as the</HI> present Time. That Sinners have such a Thought in them is evident from their Delays of Repen∣tance. All Sinners that are not grosly ignorant or desperatly blinded, do know and acknow∣ledge, that Repantance is a Duty of such Ne∣cessity, as that there can be no Salvation with∣out it. And accordingly it is their purpose to Repent, but not as yet: Hereafter they will set upon this Duty, when they come to lie on a Sick Bed, or when they are arrived to Old Age, or when they are more at Leisure, and less involved in Worldly Affairs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now, how

can they satisfy themselves in thus doing, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they do not imagine that hereafter may be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good a season, if not a better or more conveni∣ent season to Repent in than <HI>Now</HI>? Procrastina∣tion carries this imagination along with it But this is a Vain Thought.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is reckoning upon a Time which 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> uncertain whether they shall ever enjoy.</HI> Loytering Sinners do promise themselves an <HI>hereafter</HI> to Re¦pent in; but they have no sure ground to buil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such a promise upon: So far are they from be¦ing certain of the expected future Season, as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 'tis altogether most uncertain. Nothing is or¦dinarily more uncertain to Men than the Peri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of their Lives.

How frequent are such Instance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Course of Divine Providence?

<P N="2">2. <HI>IF the Time alotted upon should Arrive, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is less probability of their Repenting then than n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> They themselves indeed may suppose it more probable that they shall then Repent; yet i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reality, it is far more improbable that they should so do.

their future, than present Repentance. What∣ever they think, they will be farther off from Repentance than ever. There are three things which give ground for such a Perswasion.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THEY will certainly be more hardened in Sin.</HI> Hardness of Heart, is a natural Consequent of delaying Repentance, Heb. 3.15. <HI>While its said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</HI> If Men refuse to hearken to the Voice of GOD calling upon them to Day to Repent, they will contract greater hardness of heart. The longer Men live in Sin, the more Sin is strengthned and confirmed in them. Continuance in a customary practice of Sin, makes turning from it▪ exceedingly more difficult; Jer. 13.23. <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the Leopard his spots? them may ye also do good, that are accusto∣med to do evil.</HI> Supposing then that Men should live till that hereafter which they dream of, they will be so hardened in Sin, as to have less of an heart to Repent. Oftentimes they are stupid senseless and secure, which is an Evidence of pro∣digious hardness of heart contracted. They have nothing of that sense of the evil and danger of Sin which they formerly had. Their Con∣sciences are asleep, and they go away with as much quietness, as if they had not the least Guilt lying upon them.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>THEY may be more uncapable of that scri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Consideration, which is necessary to saving Repentance.</HI> There can be no sound Repentance where Men do not consider of their evil doings: Now here∣after Men may not he in a Capacity for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

Is not this oftentimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> manner in which such Sinners Die? and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> can say that it shall not be so with them?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THEY will have less reason to expect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tance of the Holy Spirit, without which 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> possible for them sincerely to Repent.</HI> If they supp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> 'tis in their own power to Repent when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, they do fatally deceive themselves: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 'tis GOD only that can work in us a soft <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> penitent frame of heart.

Have they not quenched the Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Holy Spirit formerly? when He co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦ced them of the need of Repenting speedi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> did they not stifle His Convictions under p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>¦tence of Repenting hereafter? Did they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> purpose notwithstanding to continue and go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> longer in their Sinful ways, and not turn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, till a great while hence? And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reason have such to think that the Spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> GOD will at the last, work in them that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦pentance
<PB N="53" REF="002302_0028_0FDB1CBF32B5EB18"/>
which will be unto Salvation? Have they not much more just ground to think that He will utterly withdraw from them, and leave them to Die and Perish in their Sins? Surely this is what in an ordinary way, may be ex∣pected. That offered Grace, that has been so long despised by delaying Sinners, may most justly be denied to them at the last, and most probably will be so.</P>
<P>WE see then, that 'tis a <HI>Vain Thought,</HI> That we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as well Repent hereafter as now. Let us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen entertain such a Vain Thought: But on the contrary, let us think, that <HI>Now</HI> is the accepted Time, <HI>Now</HI> is the Day of Salvation; that the present Time, is the best Time to set about the Work of Repenting and turning to GOD; and accordingly let us make haste and Delay no longer. Let us agree quickly with GOD who is our Adversary, and get into good Terms with Him as soon as possible. What∣soever our hands do find to do, in the mat∣ter of our Repentance, let us do it with all our might, before it be too late. Our early and speedy Repentance is what we shall never Re∣pent us of. It will be an abundant Consola∣tion, that we have not the Work of Repentance to do at Death. We may then be satisfied that having heretofore sown in Tears, we are now going to Reap in Joy, and that Jesus Christ says to us as to the Penitent Thief, <HI>This Day shalt th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> be with me in Paradise.</HI></P>
<P>THUS for the first <HI>Vain Thought</HI> concerning Repentance.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="54" REF="002302_0029_0FDB1CC0ACADF530"/>2. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That if a gross Sin be Confessed and Bewailed, it is truly Repented of, though it be not forsaken.</HI> Such a Thought as this there is sometimes in the hearts of Sinners. They are Guilty it may be, of the Sin of Drunken∣ness, Uncleanness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Hereupon they make Confession of it to GOD, Mourn for it, and ear∣nestly beg the Pardon of it. Having thus done, they think themselves truly Penitent, tho' up∣on the next Opportunity and Temptation, they commit the same Sin again; and when they have thus repeated their Sin, they renew also their Confessions and Lamentations: And thu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they go on Sinning and Confessing, and because as often as they Sin, so often they bemoan it they suppose that they do really Repent of it▪ But this is a Destructive and Vain Thought.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>GOD has destroyed Sinners for continuing to Commit gross Sins, though they have Confessed and Bewailed them</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> remarkable Instance of thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kind we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in <HI>Pharaoh</HI> King of <HI>Aegypt</HI>: H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> refused at the Command of GOD to let <HI>Isra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> go; hereupon GOD Punished him with on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sort of Plague; under the Calamity of this Judg¦ment he Confesses his Sin, and begs Praye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for the removal of the Judgment, and promise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to let <HI>Israel</HI> go. No sooner is the Plague re¦moved, but he renews his disobedience to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Command of GOD. Hereupon GOD smites him with another Plague, then again he Confesse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Sin, justifys GOD, condemns himself and his People, and Prays for the removal of tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Plague; no sooner is this Plague removed, but he returns to his Sin.

<PB N="55" REF="002302_0029_0FDB1CC0ACADF530"/>
Confessions and Rebellions, till at length GOD Destroyed him in a most astonishing manner. This Example plainly shows, that tho' Sinners do never so often confess and bewail their Sins, yet if they persist in them, they do not truly Repent of them. If this were saving Repentance the Wrath of GOD would not come upon them as it did upon <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> In Truth, such Re∣pentance is but a mock-Repentance, which does rather pull down the Wrath of GOD, than turn it away.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>TURNING fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m all gross Sin, as to the Customary practice of it, is essential to true Repentance.</HI> There are Sins of Infirmity, which are una∣voidable and cannot be wholly abstained from in this Life; but we shall daily be more or less overtaken with them. Of this nature are, some Distractions and wanderings of Mind in the Duties of Prayer, Reading and Hearing the Word of GOD; some sudden involuntary Motions of sinful Fear, Shame, Anger, Grief, Joy; some vain, foolish, idle Thoughts: The best of Men cannot possibly keep themselves free from such Sins as these. Therefore 'tis not to be supposed that none are truly Peni∣tent who do not so Repent of them, as to keep clear of them. Such Sins as these are turned from, only as to Allowance, Approbation and Indulgence: A true Penitent Mourns for these Sins, disapproves of them and detests them, and would gladly be freed from them; yet he can∣not keep himself free from them. But then as for gross and heinous Acts of Sin, every true Penitent turns from them, as to the frequent

have sinned in Stealing from their Neighbour, or defrauding him. Hereupon they may Con∣fess their Sin to GOD, and beg the Pardon of it; yet all this while never purpose or take any Care to Restore what is thus unrighteously gotten: Without doing this, they suppose their Repentance is sincere and acceptable to God: But this is a <HI>Vain Thought.</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>HE that refuses to make Restitution, does not seriously Confess his unrighteousness to GOD.</HI> There ought to be explicite and solemn Confession of known gross Sins to GOD. He that does not thus Confess them to GOD, does not really Re∣pent of them. Now such serious and solemn Confession of the Sin of unrighteousness, is not made by one that refuses to Restore dishonest Gain: For if he speaks out all that is in heart, his Confession must run in such Terms as these. <HI>Lord, I acknowledge mine Iniquity, in Tres∣passing against my Neighbour. I have sinned in that I have wronged him in his Wordly Interests. How∣ever, I purpose not to do him Right; but to Live and die in the Possession of what I have unjustly gotten from him.</HI> Can such a Confession as this be called <HI>Serious</HI>? Is it not rather a mocking of, and trifling with the most High GOD?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>HE that refuses to make Restitution, does not really hate and grieve for the Sin of unrighteousness, which he has been guilty of.</HI> Nothing is more clear than that Repentance includes in it, an hatred of and sorrow for Sins Committed. But how can a Man say that he does hate his unrighteous Action, and is heartily grieved for it, when he has no

will to Restore what he has unrighteously Gain∣ed? These things are utterly inconsistent. Did a Man indeed abhor the injustice he has perpe∣trated and were he afflicted in spirit for it, he would labour to repair the damage he has thereby done to his Neighbour. Men do but falsely pre∣tend that they hate and are grieved for an un∣just Acquisition, while they contentedly abide in a possession equally unjust: How could they quietly keep what they have deceitfully gotten, if they had the least spark of Godly sorrow for their deceitful Dealing? While Men wil∣lingly neglect to make Restitution, they do but delude themselves in thinking they have th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Godly sorrow for their Sin, which worketh Re∣pentance unto Salvation. Were it sound Repen∣tance it would bring forth the fruits of Righ∣teousness and Honesty is Evidences thereof.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>HE that refuseth to make Restitution lives in the Omission of a plain Duty.</HI> 'Tis evident, that he does not really Repent of his unrighteousness, who neglects to do what GOD requires of him in that Case: For by neglecting to do what GOD Commands him, he adds Sin to Sin; and con∣sequently is so far from Repenting of what h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has done, that he becomes more Guilty in the sight of GOD. Now by refusing to restor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unjust Gain, Men are disobedient to GOD, they don't do, what they stand bound to do by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Law of GOD. There is a twofold Law which in this Case they do Transgress; they Transgress the Law of <HI>Christian Charity.</HI> The Command of GOD is that in Matth. 19.19. <HI>Thou shalt lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thy Neighbour as thy self.</HI> We must Love our

Neighbour with the same <HI>Truth</HI> of Love, as we do our selves, though not with the same <HI>Degree</HI> of Love. But how can Men say that they as truely Love their Neighbour as they do them∣selves, when they have wronged him, and won't do him Right? Of true Love it is said, <HI>That it worketh no ill to his Neighbour,</HI> Rom. 13.10. It won't hurt him in his Estate; but will rather help him, and promote his outward welfare.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P>THEY Transgress the Law of <HI>Equity.</HI> The Command of GOD is that in Mic. 6.8. <HI>Do Justly</HI>; and that in Prov 3.27. <HI>Withold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.</HI> Tho' it be in the power of our hand to withold it from him, yet we ought not to do it; but should restore it to him. Is it not a just thing to give every Man that which is his own? Is there any Man living that does not know this to be just and equal? Is not this the Foundation of all Laws and Courts of Judi∣cature for the securing every Man's Property? Nay, Do not the Early Dictates of natural Light, teach even little Children to say, <HI>That's mine, give me it?</HI> Men then cannot but know that 'tis a Point of Justice to return to every Man that which is his. And when it respects themselves. they can instantly see the Equity in it, and reck∣on those Unjust, who keep that from them, which of Right belongs to them. Such then as refuse to Restore what they have unjustly gotten from their Neighbour, are transgressors of the Law of Charity and Equity; and while they are willingly and resolvedly so, how can it be tho't that they Repent of their unrighteousness? They

<HEAD>THUS much for the Third <HI>Vain Thought</HI> concerning <HI>Repentance.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="4">4. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That Repentance is no Gospel Duty.</HI> This is the most Vain and worst Thought of all, and yet a Thought by some entertained; they call Repentance a Legal Duty, and the Preaching of it Legal Preaching, they think that a Child of GOD ought not to be troubled for his Sins; and that it does not be∣come a Gospel-Spirit to grieve and sorrow for Miscarriages. They say, that GOD beholds no Iniquity in <HI>Jacob,</HI> takes no notice of them, as having from Eternity Pardoned them; and there∣fore they ought not to Mourn for them: Thus speaks the abominable Antinomian. Such a Thought as this is most pernicious, as it makes Men secure and quiet in Sin and Impenitency. The Vanity of this Thought is so obvious as that little needs be said to Evidence it.</P>
<P>Yet,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>NOTHING is more clearly revealed in the Gospel to be a Duty, than that of Repentance.</HI> 'Tis altogether needless to produce the Multiplied Commands to Repent. It may suffice only to say that Repentance was constantly pressed by Jesus Christ the Author of the Gospel In His Publick Ministry he made it one of the chief Sub∣jects
<PB N="62" REF="002302_0033_0FDB1CCD62B96B68"/>
which He insisted upon, as being that which He was especially sent to call Sinners unto, Math. 9.13. <HI>I am not come to call the Righ∣teous but Sinners to Repentance</HI>: And it is Recor∣ded of Him, that this was His Practice; Mat. 4.17. <HI>At that time Jesus began to Preach and to say, Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</HI> Mark 1.14, 15. <HI>Jesus came into Galilee, Preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God, saying, Repent ye, and believe the Gospel.</HI> Now surely Jesus Christ was a Gospel Preacher, and Preached Repentance as an Evangelical Duty; and not only did He thus Himself; but likewise Commanded His Apostle to Preach the same Doctrine of Repen∣tance, Luke 24.46, 47. <HI>He said unto them, — That Repentance and Remission of Sins should be Prea∣ched in his name, among all Nations.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>REPENTANCE is Commanded in the Gos∣pel as necessary to Salvation.</HI> 'Tis not only required as a Duty; but as a Duty of absolute neces<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> unto Salvation. Without it Men cannot be Par∣doned. Acts 3.19. <HI>Repent ye therefore and he Con∣verted, that your Sins may be blotted out.</HI> Without it Men cannot be Saved; Luke 13 3, 5. <HI>Except ye Repent, ye shall likewise Perish.</HI> Impenitency will end in Eternal Perdition; Rom. 2.5 <HI>after this impenitent heart, treasurest up to thy self Wrath,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WE see then, That it is a <HI>Vain Thought,</HI> That Repentance is a needless thing, and not calle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for in the Gospel. Let not such a Thought lodge in us; but let us know and believe that GOD now Commands all Men every where to Repent, and that if we do not exercise our selves in Re∣pentance, we shall Eternally Perish.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<PB N="63" REF="002302_0033_0FDB1CCD62B96B68"/>
<HEAD>THUS much for the Fifth sort of <HI>Vain Thoughts,</HI> viz. those concerning <HI>Repentance.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="6">6. <HI>THERE are</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>in the Hearts of Sinners concerning</HI> Obedience, <HI>which are great Hindrances of their being Saved.</HI> Sinners do many times take up wrong notions of true Obedience. They think they do indeed Obey GOD, when they do not; and thus falling short in their Obedience, they do miss of Salvation. Some of their <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> in this Case may be mentioned.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That Partial Obedience to the Commandments of GOD is true Obedience.</HI> If Men Obey GOD in some things, in many things, they think they Obey Him acceptably, though they don't Obey Him in all things. Thus Men sometimes are seemingly careful and exact in observing the Duties of the First Table of the Law; they seem to be very Religious towards GOD, in performing those Duties of Worship which He requires of them. They Pray to GOD in their Families, they Pray also in Secret, they frequent the Publick Wor∣ship and Ordinances of GOD, and are seemingly Devout therein: And now they think they are Dutiful and Obedient Christians, though it may be all this while they neglect the Duties of the Second Table of the Law: They are not Just and Honest in their Dealings, they are not Charitable and Beneficent, they are not Chaste and Sober.</P>
<P>AGAIN, On the other hand, Men are some∣times strict Observers of the Second Table o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="64" REF="002302_0034_0FDB1CCEF614F880"/>
the Law; but are negligent and careless <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bout the Duties of the First Table of the Law: They are Men of Justice and Honesty, Sober and Temperate, Kind and Charitable: And now they think they are good Livers; and do as much as needs to be done; though all this while they neglect Prayer, Reading of the Holy Scrip∣tures and attending on GOD in Gospel Ordi∣nances, and Sanctifying the Sabbath: But 'tis a <HI>Vain Thought,</HI> that such Partial Obedience i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Right and well-pleasing Obedience. The Vanity of this Thought thus appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD requires of Men Universal Obedience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> His Commandments.</HI> He does not allow Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dispense with any of His Commands, but en∣joins the Observation of them all, without Ex∣ception. The more difficult, as well as the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> easy, the least as well as the greatest, are a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to be complied with. Numb. 15.40. <HI>That ye may remember and do all my Commandments. Mat.</HI> 28.20. <HI>Teaching them to observe all things which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have Commanded you.</HI> Conformity to the whole Law of GOD is expected and demanded of us. Our Obedience ought to be as extensive as the Law of GOD, reaching to every part of it Every Duty required must be practised, and no one of them willingly Omitted. Unless there be such a Care to keep all the Commandment of GOD, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our Obedience is unsound.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>PARTIAL Obedience is so far from being pleasing to GOD, as that it is exceeding provo∣king to Him.</HI> The Holy Lord rejects and abhors such half serving of Him. Isa. 1.11, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. <HI>To
<PB N="65" REF="002302_0034_0FDB1CCEF614F880"/>
what purpose is the multitude of your Sacrifices unto me? saith the Lord.

And I delight not in the blood of Bullocks, or of Lambs, or of He-goats. Bring no more Vain Oblations, incense is an abomination unto me,</HI> &amp;c. All these were things which GOD required, and yet the Lord testi∣fies his abhorence of them. The reason here∣of was because they all this while neglected the Duties of the Second Table of the Law; <HI>Ver.</HI> 17. <HI>Learn to do well, seek Judgment, relieve the Oppressed, judge the Fatherless, plead for the Widow.</HI> And our Lord Jesus Christ denounces Woes to such Partial Keepers of GOD's Commandments, Matth, 23.23. <HI>Wo unto you Scribes and Pharisees, Hypo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rites; for ye pay tythe of Mine, and Annise and Cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy and Faith; these things ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</HI> And most justly may GOD be offen∣ded at such partial Obedience. For there is no regard to the Authority of GOD in such Obe∣dience. Things are to be done for this reason because GOD Commands them: Psal. 119.4, 5. <HI>Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently. O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes</HI>! The Authority of GOD should be the ground of our Obedience; but now such as are par∣tial in their Obedience, have no respect to the Authority of GOD: If that were their Mo∣tive to keep any of the Commandments of GOD, it would move them to keep all His Command∣ments; for the Authority of GOD is alike unstamped on all the Commandments. Such then are Guilty of Contempt of the Divine Au∣thority.
<PB N="66" REF="002302_0035_0FDB1CD05D96C4A0"/>
Again, in partial Obedience there is no Exercise of Love to GOD: Our Obedience ought to flow from a Principle of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove to GOD. And when it does so, is will make us study to do all GOD's Will, 1 Joh. 5.3. <HI>For this is the Love of God, that we keep his Commandments; and his Commandments are not grievous.</HI> None of the Commands of GOD are grievous or distastefull to one that truly Loves GOD: He likes then all, and endeavours to keep them all. Such then as Obey some Commands, and disobey others, do nothing from Love to GOD W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> then may GOD be displeased at what they do.</P>
<P>FROM these things it appears that Partial Obedience is not right and acceptable Obedience. Let us not then vainly think that it is true O∣bedience: But on the other hand, let us think that Integrity or Universality is essential to E∣vangelical Obedience: And accordingly let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shew our selves Cordial Friends to Christ, by doing whatsoever He has Commanded us. Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s be such as <HI>Zecharias</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who walked in all the Commandments and Ordinan∣ces of the Lord blameless. Let us have a Con∣scientious respect to all GOD's Commandments, then shall we not be ashamed.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THUS for the First <HI>Vain Thought</HI> concerning <HI>Obedience.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1 <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That meer extend Obedience is true Obedience.</HI> Some Men think, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they do outwardly conform to the Law of GOD, they Obey it sufficiently and acceptably.
<PB N="67" REF="002302_0035_0FDB1CD05D96C4A0"/>
Thus the Pharisees esteemed themselves very strict observers of the Law of GOD, when they only kept it Externally, doing no more than the outward Duties of Religion. So many suppose, that if they are outwardly blameles<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and regular, that they do as much as GOD calls for. If they perform Duties of Religious Worship as to the outward Acts of them; if they are Just and Honest, Sober, Chast and Charitable, they think they are Righteous Per∣sons that duely observe the Commandments of GOD. But this is a <HI>Vain Thought,</HI> as thus appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD requires inward Obedience of Men, and that Principally.</HI> The Law of GOD is a Spiri∣tual Law, Rom. 7.14. <HI>The Law is Spiritual.</HI> It is given as a Law to the Soul and Spirit of a Man. It reaches all the Faculties of the Soul, all the Affections of the Heart, and the Actings of them, requiring their Conformity thereunto. The Law of GOD is to be kept with our Spirits, as well as with our Bodies. GOD calls for the Heart and Spirit in His Service, Joh. 4.23, 24. <HI>The true Worshippers shall Worship the Father in Spirit and in Truth; for the Father seeketh such to Worship him. God is a Spirit, and they that Worship him, must Worship him in a Spirit and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Truth.</HI> The Heart and Spirit must be engaged in all our Worship and Obedience. This is the Life and Soul of all Obedience: This GOD chiefly minds and calls for, Jer. 30.21. — <HI>For who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st saith the Lord.</HI> Where therefore the Heart is wanting, GOD is not obeyed as He ought to be, though Men be never so outwardly
<PB N="68" REF="002302_0036_0FDB1CD847315EA0"/>
exact in what they do. If their inward Thoughts, Desires, Aims and Ends are not regulated by the Holy Law of GOD, they do not rightly obey GOD, though their Speeches and outward Actions be never so Conformed to the Law of GOD. Outside Obedience, is the least part of Obedience: Spiritual Obedience is the chief.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>OUTWARD Obedience without Inward, it exceeding displeasing to GOD.</HI> So far is GOD from taking up satisfied therewith, as that H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> abhorrs it. To turn GOD off with meer out side Service, is hateful Hypocrisy or Formality, which are abomidable unto GOD. Thus our Lord testifies concerning the Hypocritical Scril<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Pharisees, Matth. 15.7, 8. <HI>Ye hyphocrites, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did Esaias Prophesy of you, saying, This People draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, but their heart is far from me.</HI> And upon this Account our Lord denounces a Woe unto them, Matth. 23, 27, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Wo unto you Scribes and Pharisees, Hyphocrites; for ye are like unto whited Sepulchers, which indeed ap∣pear beautiful outward, but are within full of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Men's bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto Men, but within ye are full of Hypocrisy and Iniquity.</HI> Men that are only externally Religious, are no better tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Painted Sepulchres, most loathsome to the Holy GOD. Though their Lives be never so spe∣cious and beautiful in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ye of the World; yet if in their Hearts they do not Love GOD, Delight in Him, Desire Him. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Reverence Him, all is disregarded of GOD. He make no Account of Bodily Exercises, when the Heart is witheld from them. If Men come up
<PB N="69" REF="002302_0036_0FDB1CD847315EA0"/>
to the Publick Worship of GOD, and outwardly attend on His Ordnances; yet if their Hearts go after their Covetousness, or any other Lust, GOD regards them not. If Men Pray long and often, yet if their Hearts go not out to GOD, and Pant not after Communion with Him, He regards not their Prayers. If Men give Alms, dispense their Bounties, yet not with a willing and cheerful Mind readily complying with the call of GOD thereto, the Lord regards it not. Let us not then harbour such a Thought in us, as if meer Bodily Obedience were Sin∣cere and True Obedience. But on the other hand, Let us think, that if we would accepta∣bly obey GOD, we must obey with and from the Heart. With our Spirits we must serve Him, approving our Hearts to Him in all our ways. With our whole Man we must obey Him, Labouring to Glorify GOD both with our Bodies and with our Spirits: Knowing, that if we have both pure hands and a clean heart, we shall ascend into the Hill of the Lord, and stand in His Holy Place above, and there see the Lord and be like Him.</P>

<HEAD>THUS for the Second <HI>Vain Thought</HI> con∣cerning <HI>Obedience.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="3">3. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That our own Per∣sonal Obedience is that which does Justify us in the sight of GOD.</HI> The Jews in the Apostles times we possessed with this imagination, that they might be Justified by their own Righteousness, a Righteousness of their own working out. They endeavoured to keep the Law, expecting thereby
<PB N="70" REF="002302_0037_0FDB1CD9649A0690"/>
to Justify themselves before GOD. Thus says the Apostle concerning them, Rom. 9.32. <HI>They sought Righteousness by the works of the Law.</HI> And again, Chap. 10.3. <HI>They go about to establish their own Righteousness.</HI> Thus do many that call them∣selves Christians: They think their own Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Obedience can Justify them before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of GOD: But this is a Proud and <HI>Vain Thought</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>OUR own Obedience cannot, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stify for our Sin, and therefore cannot Justify us before GOD.</HI> Justi∣fication includes in it an exemption from Con∣demnation, on the Account of Sin. A Justifyed Person has no matter of Guilt laid to his Charge. Rom. 8 33. <HI>Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? It is God that justifyeth.</HI> He that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Justifyed is acquitted and absolved, all Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sins are answered for. That then which Justi∣fies us, does Justify us from all our Iniquities; 'tis that in consideration whereof GOD Pardon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all our Sins, and absolves us from the Curse of the Law; 'tis that which is the ground and cause of the Remission of Sin. If it does not re∣move our Guilt and free us from Condemnation, it does not Justify us in the sight of GOD. Now this our own Obedience, cannot possibly do; it cannot make amends for our Sins. Our best Obedience is what we owe to GOD, and therefore can't be my Satisfaction for past Sins. The most Holy Men cannot Answer for the least of all their Sins; Job 9.2, 3 <HI>How should Man be just with God? If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</HI> All out Duties, and all our Sufferings won't satisfy for any of our Sins; the best of them are defective
<PB N="71" REF="002302_0037_0FDB1CD9649A0690"/>
and defiled so as to need Pardon, and there∣fore cannot procure Pardon for us. 'Tis only the Righteousness of Jesus Christ, that satisfies Divine Justice for our Sins, and for the sake whereof all our Sins are forgiven; Eph. 4.32. <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Christ's sake hath forgiven you.</HI> For the sake of His Satisfaction GOD forgives Sin to us, and not for the sake of any Satisfaction given by our selves. We are therefore said to be <HI>Justified by the Blood of Christ,</HI> Rom. 5.9. And 'tis that alone <HI>which cleanses from all Sin,</HI> 1 Joh. 1.7. 'Tis His Blood which pacifies GOD, and turns away His Anger from us, and re∣conciles us to GOD; Rom. 5.10. <HI>When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>OUR own Obedience cannot Merit Eternal Life for us, and therefore cannot Justify us before GOD.</HI> Justification includes in it a Right to Eternal Life; 'tis therefore called, <HI>Justification unto Life,</HI> Rom. 5.18. A Justified Person is ad∣judged worthy of Eternal Life, and is look'd upon as one that has a Just Title to Eternal Life; that then which Justifies a Man before GOD, Merits Eternal Life for him, and is that upon the Account whereof Eternal Life is bestowed on him. A Justifying Righteousness, is a Meritorious Righteousness, which procures for us a Title to Glory. Now this our own Obedience cannot possibly do. Our most exact Obedience, is far short of what we owe to GOD. Our most Holy Performances, are interwoven with a great deal of Iniquity. So imperfect and polluted are our best Duties,
<PB N="72" REF="002302_0038_0FDB1CDAF3292718"/>
that the Condescention of GOD is to be A∣dored in taking the least Gracious Notice of them. Far are they from Meriting the smalle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Favour, much more from Meriting Eternal Ble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sedness. Heaven is not a Debt due to us from Justice, but a gift of Grace thro' Jesus Christ our Lord, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6. <HI>ult.</HI> 'Tis not our Obedien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that purchases Heaven for us, but 'tis the O∣bedience of Jesus Chirst in our stead that M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rits it for us. Our Obedience may Evidence our Title to Eternal Life, but 'tis the Obedience of Jesus Christ that procures this Title for us. <HI>'Tis he that has obtained Eternal Redemption f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> us,</HI> Heb. 9.12.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>OUR Sincere Obedience follows our Justifica∣tion, and therefore cannot be that by which we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Justified before GOD.</HI> The Objects of Justifying Grace, are ungodly Sinners; Rom. 4.5. <HI>To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that worketh not, but believeth on him that Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ti∣fieth the ungodly.</HI> They are ungodly before they are Justified, though they do not continue un∣godly after they are Justified; for in the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> moment wherein they are Justified, they are ali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> renewed by the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ Justification and Sanctification are inseparabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> joined together, 1 Cor. 6 11. <HI>Such were s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you; but ye are wasted, but ye me sanctified, but ye are justified, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.</HI> None then are Justified continuing in Sin and under the Power them. o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; for the Benefit of Sanctification always g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es along with Justification.

They do no works Spiritually Good and pleasing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o GOD, till they are brought into a Justified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tate. GOD is first reconciled to Men's Per∣sons and then to their Works; Gen. 4.4. <HI>And the Lord had respect unto Abel, and his offering.</HI> His Person was first accepted into Favour with GOD, and then his Sacrifice was accep∣ted and well pleasing to GOD. We see then that our own Obedience does not Justify us before GOD. <HI>By the works and deeds of the Law,</HI> (which means our Obedience which is made up of such works,) <HI>shall no flesh be Justified in his sight,</HI> Rom. 3.20. Let us not then trust <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o our own Righteousness for Justification; but let us renounce our own Obedience, as to depen∣dance thereon for Justification. We must not renounce Obedience as to the practice of it, but we must labour to grow more exact there∣in, and hold on in the course of it, as that whereby GOD will be Honoured, and our own Comfort, Peace and Salvation be promo∣ted. Yet however we are not to depend upon it, for Pardon and Life. In this respect we are to look off from it, as insufficient to procure Mercy and Salvation for us; and we are to look only to the Obedience of Jesus Christ to the Death for us, as that in consideration whereof GOD will forgive us all our Sins, and receive us into His Favour and Kingdom. 'Tis the alone Righteousness of Jesus Christ whereon we must rest, and which we must bring to, and Plead with GOD for, the Re∣mission our Sins, and the Salvation of our Souls. If we are thus careful to keep all the Commandments of GOD, and yet while we
<PB N="74" REF="002302_0039_0FDB1190502C84A8"/>
so do, have our entire dependance on the Righteousness of Jesus Christ, for our Justifica∣tion before GOD, then are we in the true way to Life Eternal: Our Souls are then safe, and shall not miscarry. We then do as the Holy Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> did; who is a sure Guide to us in this Case, Phil. 3.8, 9 <HI>Yea doubtless, and I account all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord; for when I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by Faith.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THUS much for the sixth sort of <HI>Vain Thoughts.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="7">7. <HI>THERE are</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>in the hearts of Sinners concerning</HI> Faith, <HI>which are great Hin∣drances of their being Saved.</HI> True Faith is es∣sential to Salvation. So it is declared to be in the Gospel, Mark 16.16. <HI>He that believeth shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned.</HI> Without Faith there is no Salvation; but cer∣tain Damnation: If Men therefore miss of Faith, they Perish for ever. Now there is scarce any thing that more endangers our missing of it, than a Vain Imagination that we are pos∣sessed of it when indeed we are not. And how many are there that think they are true Be∣lievers, when they are far from being so? They take that to be saying Faith, which is not so; and thence are deceived about them∣selves. Here I shall mention some of their <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> in this case.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="75" REF="002302_0039_0FDB1190502C84A8"/>1. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That a meer belief of the Gospel is a saving Faith.</HI> In the Days of the Apostles there were some who thought if they were perswaded of the Truth of the Gos∣pel and made a Profession of it, that they were True Believers and should be Saved. They rested in a naked Assent to the Gospel Reve∣lation of Jesus Christ. Such as these the A∣postle <HI>James</HI> does particularly write against in his Epistle. And as there was then, so there are still many who think, that if they give Credit to the Doctrines of the Gospel, they are such Believers as have the Promise of Salvation made to them: And hence 'tis that many reckon upon being Saved, because they belong to that Body of Christians, whom they suppose to be most Orthodox and sound in the Faith: But this is a <HI>Vain Thought</HI> as will appear from two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A meer belief of the Gospel, is what may be found in Hypocrites and Wicked Persons.</HI> The worst of men may be Believers of Gospel Truths: In the Holy Scriptures we have many Recor∣ded Instances of this kind: We Read of such as were Convinced of the Truth of Christ's Doctrine and that assented thereto, who yet w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e vile Persons. Thus in Joh. 6.14. <HI>Then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Men, when they had seen the Miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a Truth that Prophet that should come into the World.</HI> They believed Him to be the Messiah, the Great Prophet came from GOD; and so prevalent was their Con∣viction and Perswasion, that they would needs make Him their King, <HI>Ver.</HI> 15. <HI>There were about to come and take him by fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, to make that 1 Kings.</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="002302_0040_0FDB1CE037FA94E8"/>
And yet these same Persons not long after, turn Professed Enemies to Him. Thus it is also said of <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> that <HI>he Believed and will Baptized,</HI> Acts 8.13. He ackowledged the Truth of the Gospel, and joined himself to the Church; and yet we find in <HI>Ver.</HI> 23. <HI>That he was in the gall of bitterness and bond of Iniquity.</HI> He was all this while under the Dominion of Sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A meer Belief of the Gospel, is to be found in the Devils themselves.</HI> They Believe the Ex∣istence of GOD, Jam. 2.19. <HI>Thou believest there is one God, thou dost well; the Devils also believe and tremble.</HI> They have such a Belief of a GOD as fills them with dread and horror. They Believe there is a <HI>Jesus</HI> or Saviour for Sinful Men; Acts 19.15. <HI>And the evil spiri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said, Jesus I know.</HI> They Believe that this <HI>Jesus</HI> is the Son of GOD, and that He will it their Judge and Destroyer, Mat. 8.29. <HI>And they cryed out, saying, what have we to do with thee, Jesus thou son of God? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time.</HI> Mark 1.24. <HI>Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> alone, what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> thee who thou art, the holy one of God.</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Believe the Gospel to contain the Doctrine of Salvation, <HI>Acts</HI> 16.16, 17. The evil <HI>Spirit</HI> which Possessed the Damsel, spake by her, at least moved her to speak and say, <HI>These Men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the way of Salvation.</HI> Those evil Spirits do be∣lieve all the Doctrins of revealed Religion, and therefore do in all Ages raise up Hereticks and false Teachers to corrupt and oppose those D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctrines.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="002302_0040_0FDB1CE037FA94E8"/>WE see then, that a Faith of Assent is to be found in the worst of Men; yea, in very Devils. This then cannot be saving Faith. In∣deed, saving Faith does include this Assent in it: Yet this Assent alone is far from being justifying and saving Faith. Let us not then rest in such a dead Faith as this is, lest we Perish forever. Jam. 2.14. <HI>What doth it profit my brethren, though a Man say, he hath Faith and have not Works; can Faith save him? No is cannot.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That great Confi∣dence of Salvation, is saving Faith.</HI> Some there be that are under a strong Perswasion that they shall be Saved; they make no doubt of going to Heaven, when they go out of this World; they are full of Confidence concerning their future happy Estate. Now this Confidence they account saving Faith: But this may prove a <HI>Vain Thought.</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>SUCH great Confidence may be, and often∣times is, a fruit of gross Ignorance.</HI> Men oftentimes know not what an horrid Evil Sin is, and what dreadful Wrath it deserves: They know not how Holy and Just that GOD is, against whom they have Sinned: They know not what that Faith and Holiness is, without which no Man shall see the Lord. In short, they know very little of their Sin, Duty and Dan∣ger. And when Men are thus Ignorant, 'tis not to be wondered at, that they are so Confident. Their gross Ignorance involves them in senseless Security: They see not their Danger, and so fear nothing. And hence many times they go
<PB N="78" REF="002302_0041_0FDB1CE4D7720788"/>
out of the World with great hopes and expec∣tations of Happiness; which is indeed nothing but a pleasing Dream of such as are asleep in Sin, thro' the Blindness of their Minds, and when they awake in the other World, they find it to be so. 1 Thes. 5.3 <HI>When they say, peace and safety, then sudden destruction cometh,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>SUCH great Confidence may be, and oftentimes is, built upon a false Foundation.</HI> Men sometimes have seeming grounds for their great Confidence; there is something or other which they found their Confidence upon, though it be but a sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Foundation. Of this nature is their Pro∣fession of Religion, their participation in Privi∣leges and common Gifts of the Spirit; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which we shall have occasion to speak mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> distinctly hereafter. These are the things which cherish and support the Hope and Confidence of Hypocrites; but these are broken Reeds to lean upon which will not prevent their drop∣ping down into the Pit of Destruction.

<P>LET us not then be deceived with a Vai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and false Confidence. But let us see to it that our Confidence be well-grounded, and thereby discover it self to be a Gracious fruit of saving Faith.

<P N="8">8. <HI>THERE are</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>in the hearts of Sinners concerning</HI> Love to Christ, <HI>which are great hindrances of their being Saved.</HI> Love to Christ is necessary to Salvation by Jesus Christ. He that Loveth not our Lord Jesus Christ will be accursed; 1 Cor. 16.22. If Men therefore are deceived about their Love to Christ, and think they do really Love Him, when indeed they do not, they are in great danger of Perish∣ing Eternally. Now it is a common thing for Men to profess Love to Christ, when as in Truth they are far from Loving Him aright: They have wrong Thoughts, mistaken Notions concerning true Love to Christ, which prove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tal to them in the Issue. I shall here name some of their <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> in this Case.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That Jesus Christ is sincerely Loved, when there is an allowed abiding Love to any Sin whatsoever.</HI> There is indeed some de∣gree of Love to Sin in all such as do dearly Love our Lord Jesus Christ. Their Love to it is not wholly taken away, but there are some remains of affection to Sin in them, and will be so as long as they are in this World. Yet however, this Love to Sin is disallowed and lamented. It is a grief and trouble to them to find in their Hearts any workings of good∣will towards Sin, any tendencies unto delight in Sin. These relicks of Love to Sin, are the
<PB N="80" REF="002302_0042_0FDB1CE65B3E8C60"/>
lead and burden of their Souls; and being so, they are consistent with sincere Love to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>BUT now, When Love to any Sin is al∣lowed, cherished and willingly entertained in the heart, there is no sincere Love to Christ in that heart Yet many may think, that Christ may be their Beloved, though they harbour some Beloved Lust in their Bosoms. They think they may have a friendship for Christ, and a friendship for some Sin too. If some that evidently take pleasure in Iniquity were asked, whether they really Loved Christ, they would say, they hop'd they did; and would be much offended if they should be account<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Enemies and haters of Christ; yet such they really are; and their thought of Love to Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is a most <HI>Vain Thought.</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THOSE that Love Christ do Love Communion with Christ, and therefore cannot have an allow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> love for Sin, which separates from Christ.</HI> A Lover of Christ, is one that greatly desires and delight in Communion with Jesus Christ. Cant. 1.5. <HI>Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> makest thy Flocks to rest at noon.</HI> A Lover of Christ seeks for Opportunities of Fellowship and Converse with Jesus Christ.

and is what they would have continued and not interrupted. Hence they cannot but hate Sin which deprives them of Communion with Jesus Christ, and seperates between Him and them. They know that Sin is a Bar, and the only Bar, in the way of their sweet Fellowship with Christ, and therefore they cannot allow themselves in any Love to it. 'Tis absolutely impossible for Men to hold up delightful Com∣munion with Christ, and delightful Communion with any Lust. This is in Religion a pure, flat Contradiction. 'Tis a most Vain Imagination, that Men may take pleasure in Filthiness, In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emperance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and take real Pleasure in Communion with Christ too; 1 Joh. 1.6. <HI>If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e say that we have fellowship with him, and walk <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> darkness, we lie.</HI> 'Tis a lie, to say or think that we have Fellowship with Christ, when we maintain Converse with any Sin. For as the Apostle says in 2 Cor 6.14. <HI>What fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?</HI> These can∣not be joined together and united in a way of Communion: He that cleaves to the one will and must of necessity forsake the other.</P>

Their Sanctified Judgment concerning the matchless Excellency of Jesus Christ, does draw forth their Superlative Love to Him: None is so Lovely in their Eyes

Except sinners be Converted they cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> Matth. 18.3. Without Conversion there can be no Salvation. Now Sinners oftentimes do think themselves real Converts when in∣deed they are not; and this false Judgment which they pass upon themselves, proceeds from their Vain, mistaken Thoughts about so and Conversion. They take that to be sin∣cere Conversion, which is not so. Some of their <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> in this Case may here be mentioned.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>'TIS a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That Conviction is Conversion.</HI> There are but few Sinners, who live for any considerable time under the Faithful Preaching of the Gospel, but what do Expe∣rience some Work of Conviction. The Holy Spirit does ordinarily so far accompany the Ministry of the Word, as thereby, in some de∣gree, to Convince Sinners of their Sin and Misery. They are many times so awakned as to be full of trouble, fear and terror, which may produce Mourning for Sin, and prevent
<PB N="87" REF="002302_0045_0FDB1CEFE26FB838"/>
the taking that delight in it as formerly they did. Such is their Consternation through the Apprehension of their danger of Perishing under the Wrath of GOD, that they do bewail their past Sins, wish they had not committed them, are concerned about obtaining the Pardon of them, and have some Purposes of turning from them. Now when Sinners are under such a Convincing Sense of the Evil of their Sins and their Danger of Damnation, and are there∣by brought to a Confession of their Sin and some Humiliation for it, they are ready to conclude themselves really Converted; because they are brought out of a State of senseless Security in Sin, they think they are brought into a State of Grace; but this may be a <HI>Vain Thought.</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>THERE may be great Conviction where there is no saving Conversion.</HI> Though there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Conversion without some previous degree of Conviction, yet there may be strong Con∣viction without Conversion. In the Word of GOD we have many Instances of Sinners that were deeply Convinced, and yet were uncon∣verted. <HI>Cain</HI> was under deep Convictions of the Sinfulness and Wretchedness of his condition, yet remained in an unconverted Estate. <HI>Judas</HI> was under dreadful Convictions, yet Perished in his Iniquity. <HI>Faelix</HI> was so Convinced of his Guilt and Obnoxiousness to the Judgment of GOD as to tremble, and yet was far from being Converted. From these Examples it is evident that the Spirit of GOD may greatly awaken the Guilty Consciences of Sinners, and give them a terrifying sight of their Sin and
<PB N="88" REF="002302_0046_0FDB1CF16EF433E0"/>
Danger, and yet leave them unconverted. All are not brought out of a State of Sin, that are awakened out of Security in Sin.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>CONVICTIONS may wear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and issue in dreadful hardness of heart.</HI> This is some∣times the sad consequent of Convictions: So far are they from issuing in Conversion that they do issue in much greater hardness. This was the Case of <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> He was often under clear Con∣victions of his Sin, in disobeying the Voice of GOD, yet he waxed harder and harder under all his Convictions: His heart was nothing softened by them, but grew more hardened in his Rebellions against GOD: He contracted greater hardness, and was by the Just Judgment of GOD given up to hardness of heart unto his Destruction. And does not frequent Experience testify, that awakened Sin∣ners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eturn to their former State of wretched Security in Sin? Their Convictions die away, their troubles for Sin are soon over, their Fears and Concern about their Spiritual and Eternal Condition are at an end, and they grow more easy and quiet in Sin, than ever they were before: They do not cherish but quench the good Motions of the Holy Spirit upon their Souls, whereupon he ceases to strive with them, and so they come to loose all sense and feeling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Evil of Sin.</P>
<P>WE see then that Conviction is not Con∣version: Let us not then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ction, but be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estless until it issue in our saving Convers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on to GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o this end bless GOD for Convi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions Than<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fully entertain
<PB N="89" REF="002302_0046_0FDB1CF16EF433E0"/>
all Awakenings from the Spirit of GOD. It is a great Mercy to be roused out of Sinful Security; and it ought to be acknowledged as a Mercy. Pray also to GOD, that He would finish what He has begun, in carrying on the Work of Conviction unto thorow Conversion. Pray earnestly that He who has broken would bind up, and that He who has wounded would Mercifully heal: And give not over Prayer until you find your Convictions to be Sa∣ving by the Gracious Fruits and Effects there∣of. What these are, I shall for your help, just name to you. Self-loathing and Abhorrence, becoming vile in your own eyes: Self-judging and condemning, really Pronouncing your selves worthy of Wrath, and that GOD would be Just if He should inflict it on you: Self-despair, seeing an utter impotency and help∣lesness in your selves to save your own Souls: Sense of your need of an able Saviour and Redeemer, and that Jesus Christ alone is this alsufficient Saviour: Finally, hereupon an Humble accepting of Jesus Christ for your alone Saviour; committing your Souls unto Him, venturing your Souls upon Him, trusting in Him to be Saved from the Guilt, and Power and Punishment of Sin. If by your Convictions you are thus driven out of self, and brought to em∣brace Jesus Christ as the only hope, help and Salvation of your Souls, then are your Con∣victions Saving, then have they issued in your turning from Sin and self, unto GOD in Christ, which distinguishes them from the Con∣victions of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>tes, whereby they are de∣ceived.</P>

<HEAD>THUS for the first <HI>Vain Thought</HI> concerning <HI>Conversion.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="2">2. <HI>'TIS a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That Reformation is Conversion.</HI> Sinners do many times outwardly Reform; there is a visible Amendment in their Lives and Conversations; some Sins which they formerly addicted themselves unto, they do now forbear the practice of them; some Duties which they formerly liv'd in the neglect of, they do now live in the Performance of them. Now, because they are Reformed as to such Sins of Omission and Commission, they think they are Cnoverted Persons: Their external Reformation they look upon as an evidence of their real Conversion: But this may be a <HI>Vain Thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THERE may be Outward Reformation where there is no Inward turning from Sin.</HI> In true Con∣version the <HI>Heart and Affections</HI> are turned from Sin; the Heart is not toward Sin as formerly it was, but is set against it, it's love to Sin is turned into hatred of it; Its Joy and Delight is turned into Grief and Sorrow for it. Sin to a real Convert is become most loathsome, it is the abominable thing which his Soul hates. Now a Man may be Outwardly Reformed, and yet not thus Inwardly loath and hate Sin. Though he externally turns and abstains from Sin, yet he may inwardly love it as much as ever: His Abstinence from Sin may proceed from a meer sense of the hurt it does him in his Name or Estate. The Disgrace and Damage which attend Sinful practices may make him Reform. Or the meer fear of Damnation may
<PB N="91" REF="002302_0047_0FDB1CF896639910"/>
cause a Man to break off a sinful way of Living. His Conscience may fly in his Face, and repre∣sent to him the Wrath of GOD which his Sins expose him to: Hereupon he may Reform and amend his ways, yet all this while there is a secret allowed Love to the very Sins ab∣stained from; might he commit those Sins and yet Escape Temporal and Eternal Punishment, he would freely venture upon the Commission of them. 'Tis not an inward hatred of Sin which makes him watchful against Sin; but only a fear of the Evil Consequents of Sin; so that the Lusts of such a Person are not subdued and mortified by Grace, but are only restrained by external Motives and Considerations. Sin still bears Dominion in his Soul, though it does not break forth in his Conversation as it was won't to do: There is no change of Heart, though there be somewhat of a change of Life.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GREAT Outward Reformation may be follow∣ed with a returning to the Practice of Sin.</HI> A real Convert never more returns to a course and trade of Sinning: But oftentimes such as have been Reformed, have also fallen back to their Prophanity and Wickedness: Of such we Read, 2 Pet. 2.20, 22. <HI>After they have escaped the pol∣lutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again intan∣gled therein and overcome. It is happened unto them according to the true Proverb, the Dog is turned to his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omit again; and the Sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.</HI> They were outward∣ly Reformed, yet afterwards relapsed to their former filthy Practices. Yea, many times such
<PB N="92" REF="002302_0048_0FDB1CF9B4DFCC10"/>
as have greatly Reformed have Returned to their Sins with greater violence than ever: They have proved for more vile It vicious after their Refor∣mations, than they were before their Reformation: They wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worse than ever, so that their l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t Estate is far worse than the first, <HI>Matth.</HI> 12.4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Their Lusts that have been so long restrained, when they come to break forth again, are more impetuous and outragious.</P>
<P>WE see then that Reformation of Life is not Conversion, not always a certain evidence of it. Indeed, there is no Conversion, where there is not Reformation: Yet there may be Reformation where there is not saving Conversion. Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n rest in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er outward Reformation; but see to it that there be a real internal De∣testation of all Sin, as well as an external Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce therefrom: When these two are joined together, they are a sure evidence of a Conver∣ted Estate.

<P N="10">10. Lastly, <HI>THERE are</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>in the Hearts of Sinners concerning the</HI> Attainment <HI>of Salvation, which are great hindrances of their being Saved.</HI> Some of their Thoughts in this Case may be named.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>'TIS a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That Salvation is easily attained.</HI> Such a Thought as this there is
<PB N="93" REF="002302_0048_0FDB1CF9B4DFCC10"/>
commonly in the hearts of sinners; they think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 'tis a most easy thing to be saved. Hence it is that they are so careless about their Sal∣vation, and do so little towards it, imagining that much need not be done in order to their being saved. It may be, they outwardly at∣tend the Publick Worship of GOD on His Holy Day: It may be they do every Day make a cold, slighty Prayer to GOD, and not have Him else in their Thoughts all the Day long. It may be, they do now and then Read in the Holy Scriptures or some Books of Piety, little regarding what they Read, and less concerned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Practice it: These things it may be are the most that they do; and possibly they do not so much as this, and yet they hope in this way to be saved. Nay, sometimes sinners think it so easy a thing to be saved, as that they put off all Concern for their Salvation, till their Dying Day, supposing that a few Moments may suffice for the obtaining Eternal Salvation. Such an imagination as this, is exceeding per∣nicious and most Vain.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Commands of GOD require great Diligence in the Affair of our Salvation.</HI> When GOD is calling upon us to secure Salvation to our selves, He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ets us know that we must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake pains in order thereunto. Thus our Lord says, Luk. 13.24. <HI>Strive to enter in at the strait <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re; for many, I say unto you shall seek to enter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and shall not be able</HI> Every sort of seeking, some slight and faint endeavours won't do to bring Men to Salvation. They must <HI>Strive</HI> to enter in it the strait <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate which leads to Eternal
<PB N="94" REF="002302_0049_0FDB1CFB4CDF0370"/>
Life. The Word here Translated to <HI>Strive,</HI> signifies the putting forth all our Might and Strength, as the <HI>Combatants</HI> were won't to do, when they fought for a Prize: And so it plainly intimates, that we must give all Diligence to obtain Salvation. Thus also we have the Apostle giving that Exhortation to Christians, Phil. 2.12. <HI>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trem∣bling.</HI> We must not give way to sloth and negligence, but be diligent in the use of all means conducing to our Salvation; and that with a sollicitous Concern lest we should mist of Salvation through a failure in our Duty. In the Business of our Eternal Salvation we must not be slothful, but fervent, serious and vigo∣rous. Whatsoever our hands find to do in this matter, we are to do it with all our might, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 9.10. The Gospel is full of such calls to Di∣ligence, Labour and Watchfulness in order to Salvation. Now these calls do most evi∣dently testify unto us, that 'tis no easy thing to be saved. Were the obtaining Salvation a matter of no great Difficulty, all these Com∣mands requiring our utmost Diligence, would be needless and impertinent.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Opposition in the way of Salvation is very great.</HI> There are a great many Adversaries that labour to prevent our Salvation. There are <HI>Lusts within us, which war against our souls,</HI> 1 Pet. 2.11. These Lusts do all that they can to hinder the Salvation, and to procure the Destruction of our Souls. They obstruct us in doing those Duties which tend to the Salvation of our Souls, and they sollicit us to the Com∣mitting
<PB N="95" REF="002302_0049_0FDB1CFB4CDF0370"/>
those Sins which tend to the ruin of our Souls. Indwelling Sin is an active Princi∣ple, never idle, but always working more or less. And all its actings are constantly against the good and welfare of our Souls. Again, there is Satan who is a restless opposer of our Salvation; 1 Pet. 5.8. <HI>Your Adversary the Devil, as a roaring Lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour.</HI> His constant work and business is to tempt Men to Sin and so to bring Destructi∣on upon them. He watches all Opportunities and takes hold of all Advantages to make them Sinful and Miserable. Again, There is the World which is full of Snares and Temptations. The <HI>Men of this World</HI> by their evil Counsels and Examples, by their promises and threatnings, do much endanger our Salvation. The <HI>Things also of this World,</HI> thro' the inordinate Appetites in us after them, do very much oppose our Salvation. Our hearts are apt to be too much taken with them, too much set upon them, to the neglect of GOD and our Souls: Yea, we are too apt to abuse them by excess to the satisfying our Lusts, and so to the destroying our Souls. There is then a great deal of Opposition both from within and without which we meet with in the way to Salvation. The adversaries are many, and potent, and skilfull to Destroy. It is not then an easy matter to withstand all this opposition, and to break thro' it unto Sal∣vation. We must daily Watch and Pray, and have our eve to Jesus Christ, that His Grace may be sufficient for us, or we shall assuredly Perish by the hands of our Enemies.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="96" REF="002302_0050_0FDB1CFCC6419FA0"/>3. <HI>THE Duties required in order Salvation are exceeding Difficult.</HI> Indeed, <HI>The Commands of Christ are not in themselves grievous,</HI> 1 Joh. 5.3. <HI>But his yoke is easy,</HI> Matth. 11.28. Christ's Com∣mands in their own Nature are Easy, Pleasant and Delightful; and as far as Persons are re∣newed and assisted by the Holy Spirit, they do in some measure experimentally find them so: Yet however, thro' the Corruption of our Na∣ture, Obedience to the Commands of Christ is become impossible to unregenerate Persons, and difficult to the Regenerate in some degree, and especially at some times. There are some Duties so contrary, and cross to the Corrupt Inclina∣tions of Nature, that they cannot readily be performed without much watchfulness over our own Spirits, and very much assistance from our Lord Jesus Christ: Of this nature, are those Duties required. Math. 5.44. <HI>Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.</HI> 'Tis no easy thing for Men who are subject to sinful Passions and Infirmi∣ties to do these things. Nor is it an easy thing to be content with every Condition, to give Thanks in every thing, to trust in GOD at all times, to deny our selves, and take up our Cross and follow Christ. These are things which we cannot do without special and abundant Assistance from GOD our Saviour, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.13.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>DUTIES of Obedience though difficult must be persevered in to the end.</HI> 'Tis not enough that we Obey GOD for a time, but we must Obey Him always, in order to Salvation. Perseve∣rance
<PB N="97" REF="002302_0050_0FDB1CFCC6419FA0"/>
is a condition of Salvation; Math. 10.22. <HI>He that endureth to the end shall be saved.</HI> Rev. 1 10. <HI>Be thou faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</HI> There must be a <HI>Patient continuance in well doing,</HI> in order to Eternal Life, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.7. Such as Apostatize from their Pro∣fession and Practice of Religion will Perish; Heb. 10.38 39. <HI>If any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him, but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition.</HI> It is then necessary unto Salvation, that we abide constant in the Service of GOD. Now it is no easy thing to bold on, and hold out to the end, in the way of GOD's Commandments, notwithstanding all the Diffi∣culties and Oppositions we meet withal. Let us not then entertain such a <HI>Vain Thought,</HI> that 'tis an easy thing to be Saved. But on the o∣ther hand, let us look upon it as an exceeding difficult thing, and unto Man an impossible thing to be Saved. Nothing short of Al∣mighty Power can bring us into a state of Salvation; and nothing but the Mighty Power of GOD can preserve us in that Estate, and bring us to the Consummation of it, in the Kingdom of Heaven. Nor may we expect that GOD will exert His Power unto our Sal∣vation, unless we are diligent in the use of appointed Means. Let us not then sit still and do nothing, as if the attainment of Salvation were a matter of greatest Facility: But let us humbly wait on GOD in His own appointed way, being instant in Prayer to GOD Day and Night, following Him from one Ordinance to another, then may we hope, that GOD will meet us and Bless us, and shew us His Salvation.</P>

<HEAD>THUS much for the first <HI>Vain Thought</HI> concerning <HI>Salvation.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="2">2. <HI>'TIS a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That eminent Gifts are a certain Pledge of Salvation.</HI> GOD in the Dispensation of Common Gifts, is pleased to make a great difference between Men. On some He bestows them more sparingly, on others more plentifully. Now such as are favoured with a larger measure of Gifts than others, are apt to promise Salvation to themselves on the Ac∣count thereof; because GOD has conferred upon them a greater Gift of Knowlege in Di∣vine things, or a greater Gift in Prayer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> than on others, they think they shall be Saved. They take it for granted, that such unusual Gifts are to be reckoned among those things which accompany Salvation, which have a cer∣tain and infallible Connexion therewith: But this is a <HI>Vain Thought.</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">.1 <HI>GREAT Gifts may be unsanctifyed.</HI> Men may partake of Excellent Gifts and yet be void of true Grace. Thus the Apostle supposes that Persons may be the Subjects of <HI>Extraordinary Gifts,</HI> and yet be destitute of Love to GOD and their Neighbours; 1 Cor. 13.1, 2. <HI>Though I speak with the tongues of Men and of Angels, and have not Charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of Prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have no Charity, I am nothing.</HI> So that there may be very Glorious Gifts, even

the Gift of Tongues, the Gift of Knowledge in the great Mysteries of the Gospel, the Gift of Prophecy and miraculous Faith, and yet not the least spark of true Grace. Men of the great∣est Parts, are not always, nay, seldom are, Men of real Piety, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.26</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>HENCE Persons may be excluded from Hea∣ven, notwithstanding their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>minent Gifts.</HI> Being destitute of true Holiness, they shall not s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the Lord, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.14.

Thus our Lord has assured us, that it will be with many at the last Day: Math. 7.22, 23. <HI>Many will say to me in that Day. Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? And in thy name cast out Devils? And in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you; Depart from me ye that work iniquity.</HI> Jesus Christ will then disown them, cast them out of His Favour, and seperate them for ever from His Gracious Presence.</P>
<P>LET n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e then build their hope of Salvation upon me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gifts though never so great.

<HEAD>THUS for the second <HI>Vain Thought</HI> con∣cerning <HI>Salvation.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="3">3. <HI>IT is a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That a participation in special Privileges will secure Salvation to us.</HI> There are many singular Privileges of Christianity which Persons participate of, upon the Ac∣count whereof they hope to be Saved: Be∣cause they are interested in external Gospel. Privileges, they conclude themselves in a safe Estate: But this is a <HI>Vain Thought,</HI> as may be shewn under some particular instances of Privileges confided in.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>'TIS a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>That Descent fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> eminently Holy Ancestors will secure Salvation to us</HI> Some that are the Children and Posterity of Pious Progenitors, are apt to conclude that their Relation to such will recommend them to the Favour of GOD and assure them of the King∣dom of Heaven. They can't think that GOD will cast off and destroy the Offspring of His Holy Servants that were dear to Him: But this is a <HI>Vain Thought.</HI> Hence <HI>John</HI> the Baptist Cautions the <HI>Jews</HI> against carnal Confidence in this Case, and gives them to understand that their being the Childern of <HI>Abraham</HI> would be no Security to them against the Wrath of GOD▪ Math 3 7, 9. <HI>Who hath warned you to see from the Wrath to come?

<P>LET none then rest in their being de∣scended from an Holy Stock. Indeed, it is a great Mercy in it self to be born of Godly Pa∣rents. Such have many Prayers laid up for them▪ many Advantages which others have not, and lye nearer to the Blessing than others do; and to despise this Birth-Right is a mark of a profane Spirit, as in <HI>Esau</HI>: Yet however this is not a Privilege to be confided i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for Salvation; it may be a great Advantage to our Salvation if it be duely improved: But if it be not aright improved▪ it will be an exceeding great aggravation of our Damnation. The Children of Pagans and of Wicked Parents, will have far less to Answer for, than the Chil∣dren of Holy Believing Parents.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>'TIS a</HI> Vain Thought, <HI>Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> participation in the Ordinances of the Gospel will secure Salvation to us.</HI> Many Persons, because they are admitted to all Ordinances, do thereupon conclude that they shall be Saved. They think their visible Interest in, and outward A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>dance on GOD in these Divine Institutions, will certainly bring them to Heaven: But this is a <HI>Vain Thought.</HI> Per∣sons may be Baptized in the Name of GOD, and be solemnly Dedicated to Him in that Ordinance, they may also sit all their Days under the power∣ful Preaching of the Word of GOD; they
<PB N="102" REF="002302_0053_0FDB1CFF021A0E30"/>
may be received into the Fellowship of the Faithful, and sit down with them at the Sup∣per of the Lord, and yet be disowned by Christ at His appearing. Luk. 13 26.27. <HI>Then shall ye began to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, we have eaten and drunk in thy pre∣sence, and thou hast taught in our streets but he shall say, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>il you, I know you not whence you are, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>epare from me all ye workers in iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>LET none then trust to their Enjoyment of the Word and Ordinances of GOD. They are indeed great and distinguishing Favours, for which GOD is to be Praised; Psal. 147.19. <HI>He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his Judgments unto Israel, he hath not dealt so with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny nation; and as for his Judgments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have not known them, Praise ye the Lord.</HI> It is also a very great Advantage to enjoy the Word and Ordi∣nances of GOD; Rom. 3 1, 2. <HI>What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of Cir∣cumcision? much every way; chiefly, because tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</HI> Such as are betrusted with the Holy Oracles and things of GOD, have all external Advantages put into their hands for the Everlasting Salvation of their Souls. They are lifted up to Heaven in point of Privileges, but these Privileges must be im∣proved, in order to their bringing us to Hea∣ven. 'Tis not the meer enjoyment of them; but the Wise Improvement of them, that will assure us of Salvation by them. Let us th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> look upon them as means of Communion with GOD, and accordingly be careful to hold up Communion with GOD in the use of them. Let us then look upon them as means of Grace and Sanctification, and accordingly Labour to
<PB N="103" REF="002302_0053_0FDB1CFF021A0E30"/>
bring forth the Fruits of Holiness in a diligent attendance on them. If they are thus improved by u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, then have we enjoyed them with the Blessing of GOD, and then may we be con∣fident that they shall be the Means of bringing us to the full and Eternal Fruition of GOD in Heaven.</P>
<P>THUS much may suffice for the Doctrinal handling this Point. I shall now proceed to make some Brief Application of the whole in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Word of <HI>USE.</HI></P>
<P><HI>USE of Caution, LET us take heed that we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not Deceived by</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>to our Distincti∣on.</HI> A Caution of this Nature is given to us by the Apostle, in Eph. 5.6. <HI>Let no man deceive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with Vain Words.</HI> There were some it seems, who taught them that Men might live in For∣nication, Covetousness, and such like gross Sins, and yet find Mercy or Escape Punishment at the last. Such Words the Apostle calls <HI>Vain Words,</HI> had bids them take care that they be not de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ded by such <HI>Vain Words.</HI> We had need be con∣cerned that we be not lull'd asleep by Vain Imaginations unto our Eternal Undoing: A Vain Imagination was that which undid our first Parents and their Posterity. They vainly Thought, that by Eating the forbidden fruit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey should be Wise and knowing as Gods. This <HI>Vain Thought</HI> entertained, was the inlet to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll that Sin and Misery, that has overspread the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce of the Earth.

the Eternal World. Let us then see to it that we be not deceived by such <HI>Vain Thoughts.</HI> To enforce this Caution a little further, two things may be considered by us.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>CONSIDER what a dreadful disappoint∣ment these</HI> Vain Thought <HI>will issue in, if they are suffered to lodge within us.</HI> These <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> do fill Sinner with hopes that it shall go well with them at last, and that their Case is not so bad as it is represented to be: But their hopes and expectations will assuredly meet with frus∣tration in the latter end. And how afflicting, yea tormenting will such a disappointment be! We see that disappointment in this Life is usual matter of vexation to Men; when they looked for Good, but instead thereof meet with much Evil, how does it disquiet and trouble them▪ What then will be the Anguish and Torment of total disappointment of our Expectations in the other World? The secure and carnal Christian that hoped to find GOD a Merciful GOD to him▪ shall instead thereof find Him a most Just, Terrible and Sin avenging GOD. The Formal, Hypocritical Professor of Religion that Promised Heaven to Himself, shall instead thereof be shut out of Heaven and cast down into Hell O how killing will such a disappointment as this be! Who can conceive the bitterness of Spirit and Torment of Mind in which they will thus speak to themselves; <Q>We hop'd to have found Mercy of the Lord and to have been received into His Heavenly Kingdom; but behold! we are Eternally excluded from an Interest in Divine Mercy, and are Vessels of
<PB N="105" REF="002302_0054_0FDB1D035F28AB58"/>
Wrath fitted for and Sentenced to Everlasting Destruction. How is our hope perished▪ how is it cut off! how is it swept away as a Spiders Web! is it come to this at the last, that we must lie down in sorrow, when we hop'd to see no sorrow, and feel no evil? O that ever we should harbour those <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> which has brought such a disappointment on us!</Q></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>CONSIDER how inexcusable we shall be in the judgment of our own Consciences.</HI> Sinners may now baffle and bribe, and stop the mouth of Conscience, but then they cannot do so. Con∣science will then irresistably discharge the Duty of a Witness. Accuser and Judge. It will then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estify unto us, that we did know, or might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve known, that those Thoughts which we entertained were Vain. That we were warned against the harbouring of them▪ and might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sily have seen and known the Vanity of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we been minded so to do.

Hereupon Conscience will con∣demn us as Guilty of our own Destruction, and will declare its Approbation of the Justice and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quity of GOD in our Eternal punishment; and will Everlastingly upbraid us for our folly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd madness in taking up and retaining such <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain Thoughts</HI> in our hearts.

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>DIRECTIONS follow.</HEAD>
<P>Direct 1. <HI>LET us be jealous of our own hearts.</HI> Self-Jealousy is a good preventive of Delusion. Our hearts are naturally <HI>Deceitful above all things,</HI> Jer. 17.9. If we be not exceeding watchful we shall easily be deceived by them: They are apt to flatter us, and to suggest to us, that all is and shall be well with us, when it is far from being so. Thus it was with the Church of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> Rev. 3.17. <HI>Thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</HI> Our Deceiving hearts incline us to take up too favourable an opinion of our selves, and to think our state and ways good, when they are not so. It is therefore great folly to trust to the judgment of our own hearts, without an impartial and thorow Examination of the grounds it goes upon; Prov. 28.26. <HI>He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool.</HI> It is our Wisdom not to be too Credulous, when our hearts speak well of the Thoughts we entertain, and the practices we allow our selves in▪ There will be more of Wisdom, and less of Danger, to suspect our own hearts, than to be hasty in believing them: There can be no harm in being afraid lest we should be de∣ceived by them. We are more apt to err on the hand of Indulgence than of Severity; and there is more danger in self-Confidence, than self-Jealousy: If we are jealous of our selves, it
<PB N="107" REF="002302_0055_0FDB1D05A22D9688"/>
will only make us more concerned to be better, which will be no inconvenience to us. But if we are self-confident, we are in dan∣ger of being Secure without due concern to amend what may be amiss. Let us then put the same question to our selves, as was once put by <HI>Jehu,</HI> 2 King. 10.15. <HI>Is thy heart right</HI>? Let us enquire whether our hearts be right in the judgment they pass upon the No∣tions which we espouse, and the ways we walk in. He that is thus inquisitive, is in an hopeful way not to be Deceived by <HI>Vain Thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>Direct. 2. <HI>LET us Labour to get a well-in∣formed judgment. Vain Thoughts</HI> proceed ordina∣rily from an erroneous Mind, Eph. 4.17, 18. <HI>Walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkned.</HI> Rom. 1.21. <HI>They became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkned.</HI> Vain Ima∣ginations concerning GOD, and other things, proceed from blindness of Mind. We should therefore labour to get our Minds inlightned with the light of Truth. This will serve to rectify our Thoughts, and prevent <HI>Vain Thoughts.</HI> To this end we must Study the Scriptures which are a Light to discover to us the way of Truth and Error. If we Con∣sult those Holy Oracles of GOD, they will inform us what Thoughts are <HI>Right</HI> and what are <HI>Vain.</HI> If then we would not be left to call Good Evil, and Evil Good, let us be Conversant with the Word of GOD, which is
<PB N="108" REF="002302_0056_0FDB11981AB7DFD0"/>
the only Rule whereby to know Good or Evil. Understanding in GOD's Precepts, will dis∣cover to us <HI>Every false way,</HI> Psal. 119.104. As ever then we desire not to be Deceived, let us acquaint our selves with the unerring Word of GOD; and let us bring every Thought which we entertain to that Word, and thereby try whether it be a <HI>Vain Thought</HI> or not. If we Diligently and Conscientiously thus do, with a desire to come to the Knowledge of Truth and Duty, we may hope that we shall not be left to the deceiving power of <HI>Vain Thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>Direct. 3. <HI>BE earnest in Prayer to GOD.</HI> Un∣to self-jealousy and diligent searching the Scrip∣tures, we must add fervent Prayer to GOD: This is a Duty in all Cases useful and neces∣sary, but especially in those Cases which d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mons immediately respect the Eternal safety of our Souls; and such is the Case before us.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>AND here three things we should earnestly beg of GOD in Prayer. <HI>Viz.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT GOD would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Discover to us those</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>that may be in us.</HI> Tho' our hearts are very deceitful, yet GOD knows them thorowly, and sees all the deluding <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> that are in our hearts; they may be concealed from us, but they are not hid from GOD.

de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from our own eyes. Say as in Job 34.32. <HI>That which I see not, teach them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> If we are thus really willing and desirous to know the Evil that is in us, we shall not long abide Stran∣gers to our own hearts. GOD will shew them unto us.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THAT GOD would graciously deliver us from the deceiving Power of those</HI> Vain Thoughts <HI>that may be in us.</HI> Though our <HI>Vain Thoughts</HI> should be discovered to us; yet unless GOD put forth His Mighty Power, we shall still be deceived by them. <HI>John</HI> the Baptist discove∣red to the carnal Jews the Vanity of their Ima∣gination, that their Relation to <HI>Abraham</HI> as their Father, would secure them from Destruc∣tion, Math. 3.9. <HI>And think not to say within your lives, we have Abraham to our Father.</HI> Yet not∣withstanding they remained under the Pow∣er of this Vain Imagination. Nothing short of the mighty working of the Spirit of GOD can cast down the Vain Imaginations that are in us. We should therefore cry to GOD, that no sinful Thought may have Dominion over us, and that we may not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to hold fast Deceit.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HESE words contain the dying Prayer of the Martyr <HI>Stephen</HI> for himself: it is but a single &amp; a very short Petition, yet it comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ses in it all that blessedness, which a dy∣ing Man and a never-dying Soul can desire.

<P N="1">1. THE Object of his Prayer or the Person to whom he directs his Prayer, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Lord Jesus.</HI> Our Lord had, a little before, open'd the Heavens to Him in a miraculous manner, and favour'd Him with a bodily sight of His glori∣fyed

Humanity. <HI>He saw the Glory of God, and Jesus Christ the Son of man, standing at the right hand of God.</HI> Unto this Lord and King of Glory thus exhibited to him, he makes his <HI>Last</HI> Prayer. His Praying Season was just at an end, and he was passing out of Time into Eternity, yet in this Critical Moment which would be deci∣sive of his Eternal Condition, he directs his Prayer to the Lord Jesus. If he now apply'd himself to a wrong Object, he went out of the World Guilty of Idolatry, and consequently Perished for ever: but this Man, who was <HI>Full of Faith and of the Holy Ghost,</HI> knew Jesus Christ to be the proper Object of Religious Worship. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Him to be such a Lord as ought to be invocated by Prayer. Such a Lord, that if we had but one Prayer more to make in this World, it would be our Wisdom and Duty to make it to Him. Herein then he plainly and publickly professes his Faith con∣cerning the Glorious Godhead of Jesus Christ our Saviour. This dying Prayer to Christ for himself, and the following Prayer to Christ, not to lay the Sin of his Murderers to their Charge, are his dying Testimony to the Adorable Di∣vinity of our Lord Jesus Christ: He is the Prayer-hearing GOD▪ unto whom Men ought to Pray both for themselves and for others, and that for Spiritual and Eternal Blessings, as here.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<HI>Father, Into thy hands I commend my spirit.</HI> This Dying Servant of Christ, is concerned for the welfare of his departing Spirit, and in order to this he asks nothing more, but that Jesus Christ would r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eive his Spirit: That's enough, that's all that is needful unto the future well∣being of the Soul.

<P>Hence observe,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE,</HI> It ought to be the great Concern of every Man, That when he comes to Die, his Spirit may be received by JESUS CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>THIS was the great Concern of Holy <HI>Ste∣phen,</HI> who herein shows what ought to be the Concern of every Man.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Under several Propositions this Doctrine may be spoken to.</HEAD>
<P>Prop. 1. <HI>THERE is a Spirit in Man which is a distinct Being from his Body.</HI> Man consists of two parts, a Spirit and a Body which are dis∣tinct Substances, and of a vastly different Na∣ture. Man is not all Body, but is principally Spirit. This is his Chief and most Excellent Part: Though what and how Excellent it is, we do not our selves perfectly know. The Body of Man is indeed, a most wonderful and excel∣lent Work of GOD; Psal. 139.14. <HI>I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.</HI> The frame and constitution of the Body is truly mar∣vellous. The Spirit of Man however is a far
<PB N="114" REF="002302_0059_0FDB1D0A20AD18D8"/>
more Glorious and Excellent Being than the Body. The Spirit of Man, has such a power of Thinking, as to be able in a Moment to ex∣tend it's Thought beyond the utmost bounds of the whole Creation. It has such a power of Understanding, as to be able to discern between Truth and Error, Good and Evil. It has such a power of Election, as to be capable under∣standingly to choose GOD for its last end and chief Good. It has such vast and large Desires, which all Created Good is not suffici∣ent fully to Satisfy. In short, it is a Being of far more worth and excellency than the whole World, Math. 16.26. <HI>What is a Man profited if he shall gain the whole world, and loss his own Soul? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his Soul?</HI></P>
<P>Prop. 2. <HI>THE Spirit of a Man remains after the Death of his Body.</HI> As for the Body that is Mor∣tal and must Die; so has GOD Ordained, and so it shall be, Heb. 9.27. <HI>It is appointed unto men once to die.</HI> Death passes upon all Men by the unalterable appointment of GOD; and at Death the Body perishes, turning to rottenness and dust: But as for the Spirit of a Man that remains entire after the Dissolution of the Body. The Spirit does not Perish with the Body, as Men may Atheistically imagine.</P>
<P>Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT remains as to its Essence.</HI> For it is not capable of Dissolution into any pre-existent Prin∣ciples as the Body is; and that because it is formed immediately out of nothing. And tho' it be in the Power of GOD to annihilate it, or turn it into nothing again, yet He will not
<PB N="115" REF="002302_0059_0FDB1D0A20AD18D8"/>
thus do. He has plainly revealed it to us, that the Soul is of an immortal Nature, that it dies not with the Body, but survives it and exists after Death, (which will be evinced under the following Propositions.)</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT remains as to it's Faculties and the Exer∣cise of them.</HI> The Understanding, Will and Af∣fections do still continue and perform their pro∣per Operations. The Spirit of a Man after Death does not cease to act its Rational Powers; but undoubtedly exercises them more vigorously than ever. At Death it is freed from those clogs and obstructions, which it often met with from the Body; and so has nothing to hinder its exerting its Powers to the utmost. The way and man∣ner of its acting is to us as yet unknown; yet this should not make us in the least to question the Truth of it; for we do not know the way of our Spirit's acting while it is in the Body: Who can comprehend the manner of the Souls acting by the several Organs of the Body? And yet we make not the least doubt concerning the reality of its Actings. Why then should we disbelieve the Activity of the Soul after Death, because we cannot conceive the manner of its Operations? But that it Lives and Acts after Death, and is a Subject of Blessedness or Misery will be hereafter shown.</P>
<P N="3">Prop. 3. <HI>AFTER Death the Spirit of a Man remains not with the Body, but is separated from it.</HI> It does not abide in the Body, nor is it present with the Body, but departs from the Body; Gen. 35.18. <HI>And it came pass as her soul was in
<PB N="116" REF="002302_0060_0FDB1D0EB7DEDF28"/>
departing; for she died.</HI> 1 King. 17.21. <HI>Let this Childs soul come into him again.</HI> It was then gone out of him. Death dissolves the Union between Soul and Body, upon which the Soul immediately departs away from the Body. Hence after Death the Spirit is said to be absent from the Body, 2 Cor. 5.8. <HI>We are willing rather to be absent from the body i. e.</HI> as to our Spirits. After Death there is a real local distance between the Soul and Body, though how great a distance we know not in particular, only in general, they are as far distant from each other, as Heaven or Hell, the receptacles of Men's Spirits are from the Grave.</P>
<P>Prop. 4. <HI>THE Spirit of a Man upon its sepa∣ration from the Body, goes to Jesus Christ as its Judge.</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ is the Great Judge of all Men; all Judgment is committed unto Him. The last Judgment of Men and Angels will be managed by Jesus Christ; and so is the particular Judgment of Men as to their Spirits immediately upon Death, their Spirits do then go to GOD their Judge, Eccl. 12.7. <HI>Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.</HI> The Spirits of Men do not all go to Heaven to appear in the immediate Presence of the human nature of Jesus Christ, for nothing unclean enters there∣unto: But they go to Christ as GOD who is every where, and so can manifest himself in any Place whatsoever. Tho' in what Place or after what manner He will thus manifest Him∣self, is unknown to us. But this we know that Jesus Christ has all Power in Heaven and Earth, power over all Flesh, and power to Judge and
<PB N="117" REF="002302_0060_0FDB1D0EB7DEDF28"/>
Dispose of the separate Spirits of Men, Rev. 1.18. <HI>I am he that liveth, and was dean; and be∣hold, I am alive for evermore, Amen, and have the Keys of Hell and Death.</HI> He has the Keys of Hell or the Invisible World: He has power to dis∣pose of the Spirits of Men when they pass out of this visible, into the other invisible World.</P>
<P>Prop. 5. <HI>WHEN the Spirit of a Man goes to Christ after Death, it is received or rejected by Him.</HI> One or the other is what befalls the Soul of every Man, according to the State in which he dies.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IF a Man die in a State of Sin, his Spirit is rejected by Christ the Righteous Judge.</HI> The Son of GOD Judges it, Condemns it, Banishes it from His Presence, and casts it into Hell. How this particular Judgment is managed, and how long it is in Transacting, we cannot say: But that Judgment passes upon the separate Soul of a Sinner, and that the Judicial Sentence is exe∣cuted upon it in its rejection from Christ into the place of Punishment, is most evident from the Scriptures of Truth. Thus it is said con∣cerning the World of ungodly Men who Perished in the Blood, that <HI>their spirits are in the infernal Prison,</HI> 1 Pet. 3.19. And it is said concerning the People of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> that they are actually <HI>Suffering the vengeance of Eternal Fire,</HI> Jude 7. Which can be understood only of their Spirits, for their Bodies were consumed in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire which turned the Cities into Ashes. Thus it is also said of the Wicked rich Man that when he died <HI>he went to Hell and was in Torments,</HI> Luk. 16.23. Which cannot be meant of his
<PB N="118" REF="002302_0061_0FDB1D10DA74C038"/>
Body for that was buried in a Grave. It was therefore his Soul which was tormented in the Flames of Hell; and though this be but a Pa∣rable yet with the Scope it as clearly represents to us the Misery of seperate sinful Souls, as if it were a real Hystory, and asserted it in the most plain words. Again, We read concern∣ing Treacherous <HI>Judas,</HI> that when he died, <HI>he went to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> place,</HI> Acts 1.25. This place that he went to cannot mean the Grave, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is not <HI>Judas</HI>'s own and proper place, but the common place of all Men good and bad, <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b</HI> 30.23. It was therefore a place which of <HI>special right</HI> belonged to him, as a Betrayer of the Lord of Glory, and this can be no other than Hell the place of Torments. And con∣sequently he went to this place at Death, only as to his Spirit; his miserable Corps remain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon the Earth as a Spectacle of Horror, while his perfidious Spirit was Suffering the Ven∣geance of GOD in the place of Devils.</P>
<P>THUS it appears from the Word of GOD, that the departed Spirits of ungodly Men are seperated from Christ and sent to Hell. And besides the Word of GOD, are there not many Providential Demonstrations of this Truth, in those dreadful Anguishes which seize the Souls of Convinced Sinners, when they see the Day of their Death approaching? What amazing Distresses of Conscience are they under! what fearful Expectations of Wrath and fiery Indigna∣tion from the Lord, are they filled withal! Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se things are the fore-runners and fore-assu∣rances of that deplorable Estate their Spirits are entering upon</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="119" REF="002302_0061_0FDB1D10DA74C038"/>2. <HI>IF a M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n die in a State of Grace, his Spirit is received by Jesus Christ; is meets with a kind Re∣ception from that Glorious Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>JESUS CHRIST receives it into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Gracious Care.</HI> When the Spirit of a Godly Man goes out of his Body, Jesus Christ takes the Charge of it. He looks after it, that no injury be offered to it by the Prince of the Power of the Air, and his Hellish host; as He Himself passed in Safety and Triumph, thro' the Ter∣ritories of Satan in His Ascention to Heaven, so He takes care that the Spirits of His Ser∣vants shall have the like safe and triumphant Passage. And He not only exerts His own Pow∣er herein, but also sends His Holy and Mighty Angels to safe-guard the passing Spirits of Be∣lievers. They are all Ministring Spirits sent forth by Jesus Christ to Minister to them that are the Heirs of Salvation. <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.14. And as they Minister to the Saints in their Life-time, so also at and after their Death. Their separa∣ted Spirits are committed to the Custody and Conduct of Glorious Angels by the Lord of Angels, and are by them conveyed to the Place prepared for them; Luk. 16.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>And it came to pass that the Beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aham's bosom.</HI> They shew the Be∣lieving Soul the way to Christ, and bring it to the Place of Rest, Refreshment and Consolation, which is reserved for the People of GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>JESUS CHRIST receives it into H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rious Kingdom.</HI> The Blessed Angels that are
<PB N="120" REF="002302_0062_0FDB1D12807EC520"/>
the Souls Attendants and Guardians, do intro∣duce it into the Kingdom of Heaven, where it is received by Jesus Christ, to be and abide with Him. The Souls of Believers are then ad∣mitted into the immediate, personal Presence of Jesus Christ. <HI>When they are absent from the body, they are present with the Lord,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.8. He then fulfils that Promise which He made to them as far as it respects their separate Spirits, Joh. 14.3. <HI>I will come again and receive you to myself, that where I am there ye may be also.</HI> He takes them to Himself to be with Him in Heaven, as He said to the Penitent Thief on the Cross, Luk. 23.43. <HI>This Day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</HI> And therefore the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> expected to be with Christ, when his Soul was separated from his Body, Phil. 1.23. <HI>Ha∣ving a desire to depart and be with Christ.</HI> Thus is the Spirit of every Man received or rejected by Christ, which is the fifth Proposition.</P>
<P>Prop. 6. <HI>IT ought to be the great Concern of every Man, that when his Spirit goes to Christ at Death, it may be received by Him and not rejected.</HI> This should be his desire, this should be his en∣deavour, that when his dying Hour comes, his Spirit may be received into the Gracious Care and Glorious Kingdom of GOD our Saviour.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FOR two Reasons every Man should make this his great Concern.</HEAD>
<P>Reas. 1. <HI>IF Jesus Christ receive his Spirit, it shall be safe and happy; no evil shall befall it, all good shall come unto it.</HI> What it's Condition shall
<PB N="121" REF="002302_0062_0FDB1D12807EC520"/>
be, is represented to us in, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.23. It shall be made <HI>Perfect,</HI> it arrives to a State of Perfection to the uttermost. I Shall here but briefly men∣tion a few Particulars in which may be set be∣fore us some Representation of that Perfection which is enjoyed by the departed Spirit of a Believer.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT enjoys a most perfect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ison of the Glory of Christ.</HI> This is one thing which Christ prayed for on the account of all Believers, Joh. 17.24. <HI>I will that those whom thou hast given me, may be where I am to behold my Glory.</HI> This Prayer is in part answered to every Believer at his Death. The Soul of a Believer is then received to that sight of Christ's Glory, which be Prayed for. The Understanding which is as the eve of the Soul, has a clear view and discerning of the Glo∣ry of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT beholds the Glory of Christ</HI> as GOD, <HI>in the highest Manifestations thereof.</HI> This Glory of Christ is in it self invariably the same: But there are different degrees of its manifestation; and in Heaven there are the fullest manifesta∣tions of it to the Spirits of Just Men. Then eminently does Jesus Christ so manifest Himself to them as not unto the World. There the Saints are not in the Dark, not under any Doubts concerning His Glorious Godhead, as they are sometimes in this World. They see the Glory of His participation in all the Ex∣cellencies and Perfections of GOD, which ren∣der Him Infinitely Glorious. They see the Glory of His Divine Personality, or the incom∣prehensible manner of His Subsisting from the
<PB N="122" REF="002302_0063_0FDB1D140A8AAF48"/>
Father in the Divine Essence. They see the Glo∣ry of His being the only begotten of the Fa∣ther equal to Him in Power and Glory. They see the Glory of His co-operation with the Fa∣ther, working the same things with the Father inseparably; being together with Him the Au∣thor of all the Works of Creation and Provi∣dence. They see the Glory of His Communion with the Father, in that Infinite Joy and Delight which He experiences in the Bosom of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Fa∣ther. They see the Glory of His being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e last end of all things that as they are from Him, so they are for Him and on Him. They see the Glory of His being the Object of the Worship of every Creature in Heaven, they themselves joining with the Glorious Angels in the Ascrip∣tions of Glory and Honour. Blessing and Praise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om Him. Thus have they a clear Prospect of the Divine Glory of Jesus Christ: A Com∣prehensive Knowledge thereof they have not, neither can possibly have: For how can a Fi∣nite Being comprehend an Infinitely Glorious GOD? They have however as full and per∣fect a Knowledge of the Glory of the Godhead of Jesus Christ as they are capable of. Their enlightned and enlarged Minds are filled with the Glory of GOD in Christ Jesus.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT beholds the Glory of Christ</HI> as Mediator. This Mediatorial Glory is peculiar to Jesus Christ, who is the alone <HI>Mediator between God and Man,</HI> 1 Tim. 2.5. Some glimpse of this Glory Be∣lievers have in this World by Faith; but it is thro' a Glass darkly, and as the Understanding of a Child. But in Heaven the Spirits of Just
<PB N="123" REF="002302_0063_0FDB1D140A8AAF48"/>
Men have an immediate, full and perfect view of the Mediator's Glory. They behold the Glory of the Constitution of the Person of the Media∣tor, as it any be called, who is both GOD and Man in one Person, a most Mysterious thing, and full of astonishing Glory, the like where∣unto is not to be found. They behold the Glory of His Office, in the great Trust which GOD has reposed in Him, committing all the con∣cerns of His Glory, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Salvation of His Elect into His hands. They behold the Glory of His full Furniture for that Office, in all those unsearchable Treasures of Wisdom and Grace that are laid up in Him. They behold the Glory of His Mediatory Performances on Earth, in His State of Humiliation, clearly perceiving the Infinite Satisfaction and Merit that is in them. They behold the Glory of His Heavenly Inter∣cession, how He appears in the Presence of GOD for His People, and how He procures for them and secures to them the Favour of GOD, the Gracious acceptance of their Persons and Per∣formances. They behold the Glory of His Me∣diatory Kingdom, seeing Him to be the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mb upon the Throne, exercising Dominion over all the Works of GOD, and Governing all things in a never-failing subserviency to the Glory of GOD, and the Salvation of His Church. Thus do they behold the Transcendant Glory of their Redeemer at the Right Hand of the Majesty on High, having a Name given to Him, that is above every Name; and being the Constituted Judge before whom all shall stand, and to whom every knee shall bow as the Last Day.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="124" REF="002302_0064_0FDB1D19013989A0"/>3. <HI>IT beholds the Glory of Christ</HI> as Man. The Humane Nature of Christ, which was while here on Earth, under debasing, ignominous and dis∣honourable Circumstances, is now in Heaven Crowned with Honour and Glory in the highest Degree. And tho' this be the lowest and most Inferiour Glory of Jesus Christ, yet 'tis but little of it that we do now conceive. But the Saints in Heaven have a direct and full view of this His Created Glory. He shines in this Glory before them, as He did before His A∣postles in the Mount of Transfiguration here on Earth; there they behold this Man in all H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Glory. They behold the Glory of His hu∣mane Nature, in it's Personal Union to the Son of GOD, which is the highest Dignity where∣unto 'tis possible for a Creature to be advanced. O how Glorious is that Nature which is so as∣sumed by the Son of GOD as to become His proper Nature, and to be United to the Divine Nature in His Person! They behold the Glo∣rious Holiness of His humane Nature in its perfect freedom from all Sin, and unmeasurable fulness of Grace. They behold the Glory of His humane Nature in it's wonderful Wisdom and Knowledge. Might and Strength, whereby it criers all things in the best manner, and effects them to the best purposes in concurrence with His Divine Nature. They behold the Glory of His humanity in that radiant and resplendent Lustre that is upon it, a dark representation whereof was given in His Transfiguration, when H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Face did shine as the Sun They see that Lamb to be the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght of the City of GOD,
<PB N="125" REF="002302_0064_0FDB1D19013989A0"/>
so as to exempt if from all need of the Sun or Moon to shine in it. They find that <HI>Light</HI> to be sweet and refreshing, and that 'tis a pleasant thing to behold that Sun of Righte∣ousness while He shineth in His full bright∣ness. Thus do the departed Spirits of Holy Men enjoy a perfect Vision of the Glory of Christ in His Deity, Mediatorship and Huma∣nity. There is no vail there upon His Glory, but it all lies open to the full Perception of the Glorified. O how blessed and happy are those Spirits which stand continually before Him and behold His Face in Glory! this is that which is called the Beatifick or Blessed-making Vision. Such a Vision of the Glorious Jesus as renders them compleatly Happy. They so see Him as to be transformed into His likeness, having the Everlasting Print of His Glory left upon them. Finally, They shall see Him <HI>as theirs,</HI> in whom they have a full and Eternal Interest, whereupon with Triumphant Joy they say as in Psal. 48.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4 <HI>This God is our God for ever and ever.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>THUS for the first Thing enjoyed, viz. <HI>Per∣fect Vision of Christ.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IF the Spirit be received by Jesus Christ, it enjoys</HI> Perfect Communion <HI>with Jesus Christ.</HI> When the Elect of GOD are brought into the <HI>Kingdom of Grace,</HI> they are called unto the actual Fellowship of our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 Cor. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.9. They have saving Interest in Him and Gracious Communion with Him. 1 Joh. 1.3. <HI>And truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Son Jesus Christ.</HI> Yet this Communion which
<PB N="126" REF="002302_0065_0FDB1D1B7683A870"/>
they have with Jesus Christ here on Earth, is very imperfect: but when they shall be received in∣to the <HI>Kingdom of Glory,</HI> then they shall be admit∣ted unto most perfect Communion with Him. Their Fellowship with Him now, is only in inchoation and gradual Progress, but then it shall be in Perfection and Consummation. Com∣munion with Jesus Christ is then Perfect, when it is immediate, full, uninterrupted and ever∣lasting. Now such is the Communion which the Spirit of a Believer is received unto after its Departure from the Body.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Spirit of a Believer when received by Christ at Death enjoys</HI> immediate <HI>Communion with Jesus Christ.</HI> While the Spirit of a Believer dwells here in the Body it is at a distance from the Lord Christ, but when it departs from the Body it goes into the immediate Personal Presence of the Lord; 2 Cor. 5.6, 8. <HI>While we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. We are willing rather to be absent from the body, and pre∣sent with the Lord.</HI> So, Phil. 1.23. <HI>Having a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better.</HI> The Departed Spirits of Just Men, do see Christ Face to Face, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.12. And therefore they do enjoy immediate and most intimate in∣tercourse with the Lord of Glory. In what manner and ways this Glorious intercourse is carried on, we cannot particularly and distinctly declare. Only this we are assured of in ge∣neral, that Glorified Spirits on their part, do immediately Exercise all their Powers and Graces upon Jesus Christ, in Contemplating, Loving, Worshipping and Serving of Him; Rev. 22.3, 4.
<PB N="127" REF="002302_0065_0FDB1D1B7683A870"/>
<HI>And his servants shall serve him and see his face.</HI> On Christ's part, He sheds abroad His Love in their Hearts, making them to partake of the clearest and fullest Manifestations of His most dear Affection for them in a most immediate way. Furthermore, what sweet and Divine Con∣ferences may pass between Christ and the Church Triumphant, we cannot say. This we know that when He was Transfigured in the Mount, two of the most eminent Saints in Glory, even <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> came down and appeared to Him, and held a Conference with Him concerning His Decease at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Luk. 9.30, 31. Surely this was something of Heaven upon Earth, some small representation of what is done in Heaven above.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Spirit of a Believer when received by Christ at Death, enjoys</HI> full <HI>Communion with Christ.</HI> The Souls of Believers while in the Body have Communion with Christ only in low degrees. Tho' their Communion with Him be at some times more full than at other times, yet 'tis al∣ways incompleat. Christ now <HI>Comes into their souls, and sups with them, and they with him,</HI> Rev. 3.20. They enjoy some manifestations of Christ to them, but not full. They enjoy some sense of His Love to them, but not full. The fulness of their Communion with Christ is reserved for Heaven. There the Saints Love Christ with all their Heart, with all their Soul, with all their Mind, and with all their Might. Their Love goes out to Christ in its full Strength, and all their Graces are acted on Him in the highest degree. There also the Sun of Righteousness shines on them in His full Strength, filling them with
<PB N="128" REF="002302_0066_0FDB1D1CE270F4A0"/>
Light, Life, Comfort, Joy unspeakable and full of Glory, Psal. 16.11. <HI>In thy presence is the fulness of Joy.</HI> Then shall the Apostle's Prayer for the <HI>Ephesians</HI> have its utmost accomplishment in all the Saints; Eph. 3.19. <HI>That ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</HI> They are by Christ filled with all the fulness of GOD, to the ut∣most of their enlarged Capacity. They partake of as much of the communicable fulness of Christ as their Natures are capable of.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE Spirit of a Believer when received by Christ at Death, enjoys</HI> uninterrupted <HI>Communion with Christ.</HI> The Communion of the Saints with Christ here on Earth, is much broken and in∣terrupted by one means or other. The constant risings and workings of Corruption in them, do always in some measure disturb their free Con∣verse with Jesus Christ. Such is the remaining vanity and unsteadiness of the mind, that it often wanders from Christ in the Duties of Com∣munion. The best of GOD's Servants do sadly experience how difficult a thing it is to keep their Hearts engaged in close Communion with Christ, and how apt are they to start a∣side from Him in Holy Duties. Again, some∣times Holy Men do fall into such Sins which provoke Christ greatly to withdraw from them, and which do very much estrange their Hearts from Christ. How fearfully was <HI>David's</HI> Com∣munion with Christ interrupted and cut off by his foul Sins? Their Sins do make a very great separation between them and their GOD, <HI>Isa.</HI> 59.2. Again, the necessary occasions of the present Life, and the necessary repose of Nature by Sleep, do take them off from actual Converse

with Jesus Christ. So that on one account or other there is in this World a frequent inter∣ruption of the Saints Communion with Christ. But now, when their Spirits are received by Christ into Heaven all bars in the way of their Communion with Him, are totally removed, nothing deprives them of Communion with Christ for a Moment; they serve and enjoy Him in∣cessantly, Rev. 7.15. <HI>They are before the Throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple, and he that sitteth on his Throne shall dwell among them.</HI> No Enemy, no Adversary enters there to give the least disturbance to their sweet inter∣course with the King of Glory. There are no Temptations, hurries, darkness, confusion, cor∣ruptions to cause the withdrawing of Christ or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idings of His Face from them. There is no∣thing to occasion the least diversion of Mind from Christ the Glorious Object of their Con∣templations and Adorations. There they can say, in a far more perfect sense, what <HI>David</HI> once said. Psal. 57.7. <HI>My heart is fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, O God, my heart is fixed, I will sing and give praise.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>THE Spirit of a Believer when received by Christ at Death enjoys</HI> Everlasting <HI>Communion with Christ.</HI> It enters upon a Communion which never shall have an end. When it once enters into that Temple above, <HI>It shall go no more out,</HI> Rev. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.12. There it shall make its perpetual abode with Christ: For this denotes the lasting Na∣ture and Perpetuity of their Fellowship with Christ, as it is without intermission, so with∣out cessation. Our times of Fellowship with Christ here on Earth, are but of short continu∣ance;
<PB N="130" REF="002302_0067_0FDB1D1E6508F118"/>
but in Heaven it shall be perpetuated to all Eternity, 1 Thes 4.17. <HI>And so shall we ever be with the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THUS for the second thing enjoyed by the sepa∣rate Spirit, viz. <HI>Perfect Communion with Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>IF that Spirit of a Man be received by Christ, it enjoys Perfect Conformity to Christ.</HI> GOD from all Eternity, has determined with Himself, to make all His Chosen and Called ones like unto His Son Jesus Christ; Rom 8.29. <HI>For whom he did fore know, he also did predestinate, to be conformed to the image of his Son.</HI> This Conformity to the Son of GOD, is begun in this Life and perfected in the next. When therefore the Spirit of a Believer departs from the Body and goes to Christ, it arrives unto a fullness of Conformity to Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT it perfectly Conformed to Christ in His Sinlessness.</HI> Jesus Christ always was harmless, undefiled and separate from Sinners. He knew no Sin, did no Sin, was without all Sin; no Sin was ever inherent in Him or committed by Him. Now herein the Souls of Believers are perfectly Conformed to Jesus Christ in Heaven. In this World their Souls have Sin cleaving to them in all their Faculties, and all their Operations; but in Heaven this vicious quality is quite taken away, their Souls have nothing of Sin dwelling in them: They brought Sin into this World with them, but they carry none of it with them into the other World. There is not in the Mind the least vanity or darkness;
<PB N="131" REF="002302_0067_0FDB1D1E6508F118"/>
There is not in the Will the least aversion from Good, or the least Propensity to Evil: There is not in the Affections the least impurity or ir∣regularity. The Soul is without the least spot or blemish upon it, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.27. And this per∣fect Ejection of Sin is sweetned by the Blessed impossibility of its making any re-entrance into the Soul. It's state of compleat freedom from Sin, by the Grace, Merit and Power of Jesus Christ, is immutable. Thus is the separate Spirit, of a Believer altogether sinless and impeccable like unto the Lord who receives it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT is perfectly Conformed to Christ in His Holi∣ness.</HI> The Man Christ Jesus always was and is perfectly Holy. He is in a way of eminency <HI>the Holy and Just One,</HI> Acts 3.14. His Nature and all His Actions were perfectly Holy. Herein the Spirit of a Believer in its separate Estate is made like to Jesus Christ. In this World the Soul of a Believer is <HI>Renewed after the image of Christ in righteousness and true holiness,</HI> Eph. 4.24. And it is renewed more and more Day by Day, 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.16. The good Work of Grace and Sancti∣fication begun in it is carried on in this Life, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.6. But it attains not to Perfection till it be separated from the Body and received into the Hands of Jesus Christ. Christ has purchased Perfection for it but bestows it not till the Soul goes to Him in Heaven. Then the Soul is made like to Christ in the highest degrees of Holi∣ness it is capable of: It is Holy as the Lord Himself is Holy. Not in a way of equality, for so none is Holy as the Lord; but in a way of as full Resemblance as the Capacity of the

Soul will admit of. And this perfect Confor∣mity of the Soul to Christ in Holiness, has re∣spect both to the Nature and Actings of the Soul. It is <HI>Habitually</HI> Conformed to Christ, possessing such habits of Grace as are in Christ in the heighth of Perfection: It is full of Grace and Holiness as Christ is. It is also <HI>Actually</HI> Confor∣med to Christ, exerting such perfect Acts of Holiness as Christ: It Lives such an Holy Life as Christ Lives, doing the Will of GOD per∣fectly as it is done by Jesus Christ Himself in Heaven. Jesus Christ and the perfected Spirits with Him, are fully of one Mind, one Heart and one Way, without the least discrepancy. Such Thoughts as Christ has of GOD Holi∣ness.

This full Satisfaction of desire is also attended with a fullness of Joy. The Imagination of Man can∣not reach that gladness of Heart which springs from the refreshing light of Christ's Countenance and the most inward sense or His Love.

<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="application">
<HEAD><HI>USE,</HI> I. of Lamentation,</HEAD>
<P><HI>THAT Men are so unconcerned about having their Spirits received by Christ at Death.</HI> Alas! how little is it the Concern of Men, that their Immortal Spirits may in a Dying Hour be re∣ceived into the Redeemers Arms! How many are there that very seldom, if ever, do enter∣tain serious Thoughts of Death! instead hereof they put the Thoughts of Death far away from them. They think of <HI>Living,</HI> but not of <HI>Dying.</HI> They are concerned how they shall <HI>Live,</HI> but un∣concerned how they shall <HI>Dye.</HI> They are daily taking thought for the <HI>Body,</HI> what they shall eat, what they shall drink, and what they shall put on; but all this while take no thought about their <HI>Souls,</HI> as to what shall be done for them, or what shall become of them. How do Men Live as if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had no Souls in them, or as if they were not worth the minding, or as if it
<PB N="137" REF="002302_0070_0FDB1D28269B1650"/>
were an indifferent thing who had them after Death! How astonishing is it that Men should thus Live under the Gospel which so clearly brings Life and immortality to light! How strange and unaccountable is it, that Men pro∣fessing Belief of the immortality of their Souls, and of their passing into a State of Eternal Bles∣sedness or Misery immediately after Death, should yet be so unconcerned for them; Men believe that they must certainly and shortly Die, and it may be very speedily. They believe that after Death comes the Judgment in which their Souls shall be acquitted or condemned, recei∣ved into Heaven or cast down into Hell by Jesus Christ, the great Judge. They Believe these things, they say, and yet are very little con∣cerned whether their Souls at Death be received or rejected by Christ, whether they go to Hea∣ven or to Hell. How amazing is such stupidity and negligence? O let us take heed that we be not found of this number of secure and sottish Creatures, who neglect to make due Provision for the future welfare of their Spirits. If we are careless in this matter, how lightly soever we now account of it, we shall hereafter bitterly bewail it. We shall Mourn at the last, but with a fruitless Mourning, which will be an Aggravation of our Sorrow. Undoubtedly, When the Souls of Sinners after Death appear before the Tribunal of Jesus Christ, they are sensible of their Sin and Folly in the neglect of themselves. Undoubtedly, they express a Grief &amp; Repentance for those neglects. Undoubtedly, they wish for, and desire either a return to this World to Reform their neglects, or a Reception
<PB N="138" REF="002302_0071_0FDB1D299E6C9300"/>
into Heaven, through a Gracious Pardon of their neglects, but all such wishes and desires shall be in vain. There is no passage from Hell, either to Heaven or Earth, to be obtained, by the most passionate and importunate prayers and cries. The Gulf is then fixed and cannot be removed. The Day of Grace is then ended and can never be recalled. The Door of Heaven is then shut never to be opened. O then let us fear, least this should prove our unhappy Lot in the other World, and least we meet with that fatal repulse, in Math. 25.11, 12. <HI>After∣ward came also the other Virgins, saving, Lord, Lord, open to us But it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and said, verily, I say unto you.

This we find exemplified in the Thief upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Cross. The Lord saw in him a Penitent, bro∣ken Spirit, upon which Christ said to him, <HI>This Day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.

then will Jesus Christ receive our Spirits into His Favour and Kingdom.</P>
<P>Direct. 2. <HI>LET us receive Jesus Christ with our Spirits.</HI> To receive Christ with our Spirits is heartily to approve, embrace and entertain Jesus Christ as the only al-sufficient Saviour, resting upon Him alone for Salvation; as such a Saviour Jesus Christ is revealed and offered to us in the Gospel, and if we Cordially accept Him for our Saviour, fixing our entire depen∣dance on Him for the Salvation of our Souls, then do our Souls truly receive Him. Such an hearty Reception of Christ now, may assure us of His Reception of our Spirits at the last. If our hearts are opened to receive Him, He will open Heaven to receive them. It is said in Joh 1.12. <HI>To as many as received him, to them gave he power or privilege to become the sons of God.</HI> And if they partake of this High and Honoura∣ble Dignity of Adoption, they also partake of a Coheirship with Jesus Christ, or a Title to His Rich Inheritance, Rom. 8.17. <HI>And if Children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Jesus Christ.</HI> They have by Grace and Favour, a right to that Glorious Inheritance, whereunto Christ has a right by Nature and Purchase. Let us then with our Souls consent to take Christ in all His saving Offices. Receive Him as the great Prophet and Light of the World; belie∣ving the infallible certainty of all His Revela∣tions, and looking to Him for an enlightned Mind savingly to Understand them. Receive Him as the High Priest of our Profession, be∣lieving an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-fullness of Satisfaction and Merit
<PB N="143" REF="002302_0073_0FDB1D31DDB68D58"/>
in His Sacrifice offered on Earth, and pleaded in Heaven for us, and relying thereon for Par∣don of Sin, peace with GOD and Eternal Life. Receive Him as the King of Glory, Believing his rightful Dominion over us, and yielding Professed and real Subjection to Him. Thus let us with our hearts receive Jesus Christ by Faith, and the end of this Faith shall be the Salvation of our Souls. Such Believers on Christ now, shall be Beholders of Him hereafter. Their Faith in H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, shall issue in the Vision of Him.</P>
<P>Direct 3. <HI>LET our Spirits Converse much with Christ in their Thoughts.</HI> Though Christ be absent and at a vast distance from us, even as far as the highest Heaven is from the Earth, yet our Spi∣rits can go up to Him, and reach Him, and dwell upon Him in their Thoughts. So wonder∣ful is the Power and Excellency of the Cogi∣tative or thinking Faculty in Man, that the Mind can thereby visit the remotest parts of the World and unite it self in it's Thoughts to the Objects that are there. Thus it can ascend into the Heavens, and follow our great High Priest who is passed thereinto, and can exercise it self in sweet Contemplations on Him. As <HI>Steven,</HI> by an extraordinary Strengthning of sight, looked up to Heaven and with his Bodily Eyes beheld Jesus Christ standing at the Right Hand of GOD▪ so may a Christian with the eye of his Mind look into Heaven and take a view of Jesus Christ in His Glory there. His Heart and Conversa∣tion may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Heaven with Christ in the Actings of His Min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon Him. Thus should our Spirits be frequently employed in deep and fixed Medi∣tations
<PB N="144" REF="002302_0074_0FDB1D3380762A00"/>
on the Lord of Glory. No Object i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so worthy to take up our Thoughts as a Glori∣fied Christ. The Holy Prophets of Old, with the closest application of Mind, took a view of the Sufferings of Christ, and the Glory that should follow, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.10, 11. The Holy A∣postles scarce thought of any thing but Christ, and went over the World to turn the Hearts and Thoughts of Men towards Christ. This Holy and Heavenly Exercise is what Believers under the Gospel are especially called unto They are bid to <HI>Consider the Apostle and high Priest of their profession Christ Jesus,</HI> Heb. 3.1 They should view Him in His Person and Offices with most atten∣tive Consideration. They should <HI>Look unto Jesus the author and fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sher of their faith,</HI> Heb. 12.2. The eye of their mind should be upon Him: Contemplating Him under the various Represen∣tations of Him to us in the Gospel, especially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> He is set forth in His Heavenly Glory which is the Reward of His Sufferings, and the high∣est demonstration of their acceptableness to GOD. Well then, Let Jesus Christ be the great Subject of our Meditations. Let us often and often raise up our Spirits towards Him, and maintain an intercourse with Him in our Thoughts▪ Let no Day pass without many a flight of Thought to Him: And let us have our frequent, set Seasons for more thorough, fixed and steady pondering upon Him. If we thus do, we may hope that our Spirits shall e're it be long, follow our Thoughts; and that our Spirits which have so much conversed sweetly with Christ while in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ody, shall be received by Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r when they leave the Body.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="002302_0074_0FDB1D3380762A00"/>Direct. 4. <HI>LET us commit our Spirits to the keeping of Jesus Christ</HI> Our Souls are in extream Danger of being Eternally lost. Great is the Opposition which they meet with, from Lusts which War against our Souls, and from Temp∣tations of all kinds wherewith they are daily assaulted: And unless the Power of Christ be engaged for the Salvation of our Souls, they will assuredly fall and perish by the hands of their Adversaries. Our Spirits are no where safe but in the hands of Jesus Christ, Joh. 10.28. <HI>I give unto them Eternal Life, and they shall never Perish, nor shall any pluck them out of my hands.</HI> If He will take them into His Omnipotent hands, the Gates of Hell shall never prevail against them to their Destruction. And if we would have Jesus Christ take them into His hands, we must put them over into His hands. Our Souls, by an Act of their own must commit the keeping of themselves to the Lord Jesus Christ. They must give away themselves unto Him, Consent∣ing and Desiring that He may be the Guardian of these precious Spirits. Let us then, under a sense of our own insufficiency to keep our Spi∣rits, make a surrender of them to that most faithful and mighty Redeemer, Psal. 31 5 <HI>Into thine h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd I commit my spirit: Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.</HI> Commit them to Him leave them with Him, in a way of humble Trust and well doing, and He will preserve them to His Everlasting and Heavenly Kingdom; 2 Tim. 1.12. <HI>I know whom I have bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved, and an verily perswaded, that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day</HI> If we resign up our Spirits to the Conduct and Care of J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus

Christ, He will secure them from Damning Errors and Practices, He will lead them into all Truth and Holiness. He will guide them by His Counsel and afterwards receive them to Glory. If we judge Him fit, and only fit, to have so Rich a Treasure deposited with Him as our immortal Spirits are, and do accordingly be trust Him with them, they shall never mis∣carry.</P>
<P>Direct 5. <HI>LET us with our Spirits Love Christ and delight in Him.</HI> Jesus Christ calls upon us to give Him the Love and Affection of our Souls, Prov. 23.26 <HI>My son give me thine heart.</HI> None has such right to demand it, none such Excel∣lency to deserve it, as Jesus Christ has. <HI>He is the chief of ten thousand, and altogether lovely.</HI> Cant. 6.10, 16. He is an Object worthy of our Su∣perlative Love and Delight. Accordingly He should be our <HI>Beloved</HI> in a way of Eminency, the Person whom our very <HI>Souls do Love,</HI> and in whom <HI>our Spirits do rejoyce,</HI> Cant. 3.1. Luke 1.47. Let us then look upon Him as One in whom there is all loveliness, sweetness and pleasantness, and that in an Infiniteness of Per∣fection. Let Meditation on Him, he sweet to our Souls. Let Communion with Him, be re∣freshing to our Spirits. Let the Thought and Hope of an approaching Departure to be with Him, be the Joy and Rejoicing of our Hearts. Spirits thus solacing themselves in Christ, or but panting after Him in the anxious desires of Love, shall assuredly be carried by Angels into the bosom of that Lord, who is the Desire of all Nations and the Delight of all Heaven. He Loves and Delights in them that Love and De∣light

mentioned in our Prayers, yet we ever include Him in our Prayers, because we Pray to GOD in Three Persons, Father, Son and Holy Ghost. Jesus Christ then is to be Wor∣shipped by us, and that with our Spirits. <HI>Such he seeks to Worship him, as Worship him in Spirit and in Truth,</HI> Joh. 4.23, 24. All our Worship and Service which we yield to Jesus Christ must be Spiritual. We must Serve Him with our Spi∣rits and Glorify Him with our Spirits as well as with our Bodies, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.20. And if we are such Sincere, Hearty Worshippers and Servants of Jesus Christ while we Live, He will then at Death receive our Spirits. Joh. 12.26 <HI>Where I am, there shall my servant also be.</HI> If our Spirits Live to Christ, they shall certainly Live with Christ; Phil 1.21. <HI>For to me to live is Christ, and to dye is gain.</HI> What this Gain will be, he mentions in <HI>Ver.</HI> 23. <HI>Having a desire to depart and to be with Christ which is far better.</HI> He should as to his Spirit, after its Departure out of the Body, gain immediate Communion with Christ in Heaven: His Spirit should be with Christ and Happy in the Fruition of Him.</P>
<P>Direct 7. <HI>LET our Spirits desire Christ to re∣ceive them, and for this end principally that we may Glorify Him in Heaven for ever.</HI> If we would have Jesus Christ receive our Spirits at Death, we must humbly, and heartily, and frequently offer up our desires to Him for it in our Prayers. All our Prayers receive their full Answer in the grant of this one Petition, <HI>Lord Jesus receive my Spirit.</HI> This then should be the great mat∣ter of our R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quests to Jesus Christ, that He
<PB N="149" REF="002302_0076_0FDB1D365E855AC0"/>
would at the last receive our Immortal Spirits unto Himself: And the great end for which we desire that He should receive our Spirits, should be, that we might Eternally Glorify Him. As His Glory should be made the main end of our present, so of our future Life. All our desires should terminate in the Glory of Christ; every thing should be desired in a subordination to His Glory; and therefore not our own Glory, but the Glory of Christ, is to be made our last end in desiring to be with Christ in Glory. We should desire to be Glorified, that we may Glorify Him in the highest degree. Jesus Christ desired His own Glory in order to His Father's Glory; Joh. 17.1. <HI>Father, the hour is come, glo∣rify thy Son, that thy son may also glorify thee.</HI> In like manner we should desire our own Glory in order to the Glory of Christ, and say, <HI>Lord Jesus glorify me, that I also may glorify thee.</HI> Such sin∣cere and hearty Prayer as this is most pleasing to Jesus Christ, and shall most assuredly be an∣swered by Him. If we look upon Heaven as a Place where Jesus Christ is Glorified in every thing, at all times, in the highest degree, and upon this Consideration do ardently desire: to be there with Christ, we may be sure that our Spirits shall be received by Christ at Death, and that an entrance shall be ministred unto them abudantly, into the Everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</P>
