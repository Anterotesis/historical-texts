<HEAD>APPEALS.</HEAD>
<P>THOSE who think themselves injured or aggrieved by the judg∣ment of a monthly meeting, may appeal to the quarterly meet∣ing; provided notice be given of such intended appeal, in three months after such judgment is given, which notification the monthly meeting should enter on their minutes, and appoint four or more friends to attend the quarterly meeting, with a copy of their records in the case, signed by the clerk, and on the monthly meeting's behalf give reasons for what is done, as the case may require, submitting the same to the quarterly meeting. 1719.</P>
<P>Any person dissatisfied with the judgment of a quarterly meeting, may appeal from such judgment to the yearly meeting, on giving the said quarterly meeting, or the next ensuing, notice of such intention, which should be entered on the minutes, and four or more friends ap∣pointed to attend the yearly meeting with the records of both the month∣ly and quarterly meetings, in the case signed as aforesaid, to speak to the matter there, where it is to be finally determined.</P>
<P>All persons who may think themselves aggrieved, not pursuing the di∣rections given with respect to the time of giving notice of their appeals, shall be excluded from any right of appealing afterwards.</P>
<P>In all cases where a meeting is under the necessity of disowning any member, such member ought to have notice thereof, either by the meet∣ing's acquainting the party therewith, if present, or, if absent, by send∣ing a friend or two for that purpose; likewise when the judgment, or testimony is made, a copy should be delivered, or by two friends sent to the party, with notice of the privilege of appeal if dissatisfied: Except where the monthly meeting shall judge it too difficult to give such in∣formation in both, or either of the cases aforesaid, through the absence or the parties.</P>

<HEAD>ARBITRATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN any difference arises between friends about their inte∣rest, claims, or properties, the parties are to proceed according to the advice of the apostle, 1 Corinthians, vi. and the antient chris∣tian practices, and not at any time brother go to law with brother, ex∣cept on apparent and urgent necessity, as is hereafter limited and express∣ed, and permission from the monthly meeting obtained; but if any pro∣fessing with us shall arrest, sue, or implead at law any other person, mak∣ing the same profession, before he has proceeded in the method hereaf∣ter mentioned, or is so permitted by the monthly meeting; such ought to be dealt with as other disorderly persons, and give satisfaction to the meeting, by condemning such conduct, and in case of refusal after deli∣berate and tender dealing, they are to be disowned by the meeting to which they belong.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The manner of proceeding in cases of difference.</HEAD>
<P>The party who finds he has reason of complaint, is first himself in a calm and friendly manner to speak, or, if at a distance, write to the party by whom he is injured, or in danger of suffering his just right, and endeavour by gentle means, in a brotherly manner to obtain his right; but if it is still refused, or neglected, then let him take one or two with him, either the overseers, or some other judicious friends, or if they live at a distance, and belong to different meetings, write to, or empower one to act in like manner on his behalf, and in the same friend∣ly way make his claim or demand, and friends so accompanying the complainant, are to give their utmost assistance to have the matter justly and expeditiously ended, either by the parties themselves, or by their im∣mediate assistance; and if the matter appears plain, or is an uncontested debt, or bond against which no reasonable objection is made, those friends are to advise the party complained of, to make satisfaction without car∣rying the matter further, either to arbitration or the meeting; but if
<PB N="5" REF="027023_0004_0FD2F7F509A1B6A8"/>
there is either an unsettled difference in accounts, or reason of debate, then if they cannot persuade the determination thereof by the parties themselves, or procure it by advice and assistance, they are to per∣suade the parties to choose some suitable friends as arbitrators, and en∣gage themselves to stand to, and abide by the determination of such re∣ferrees, as is usual in like cases.</P>
<P>If either of the parties refuse such advice, or endeavours to end the difference, the one so refusing should be complained of to the monthly meeting, and notice of such intention of complaint, that they may attend at the time appointed.</P>
<P>When the case is brought into the meeting, the first enquiry should be, whether the above-mentioned gospel order has been duly observed? If not, the complaint ought to be returned, and no notice taken of it on the minutes; but if it has been regularly observed, then the meeting, to avoid as much as possible, contention and indecent noise, is to direct the hearing and determination thereof out of the meeting, and in order thereto, the parties may nominate each, one, or mere friends, as the im∣portance of the matter may require, and the meeting add, one, or more, as they see occasion in the nature of the complaint, or for further ne∣cessary enquiry; and the committee so nominated, are to avoid all unne∣cessary delays, in their determination, and make report if possible to the ensuing monthly meeting.</P>
<P>If either party refuse to attend the arbitration, and submit their cause, and stand to, and abide the award, judgment, and determination of the friends so nominated and appointed, such person must be dealt with as one disorderly, who regards not peace either in himself, or in the church, and that slights the love, order, and unity of the brethren; and if, after due admonition, the party persist therein, let him be disowned and testi∣fied against by the meeting; after which the other friend may apply to the law for remedy.</P>
<P>But if any find themselves aggrieved by such award, judgment, or determination, and apply to the monthly meeting for a re-hearing, be∣fore the said judgment be confirmed by the meeting, let it be allowed; except in cases where bonds are entered into by the parties to abide such judgment, in which cases it ought to be final. And if the party is still dissatisfied with the judgment of the monthly meeting, and shall notify
<PB N="6" REF="027023_0005_0FD2F7FA2CA4B9E8"/>
their intention of making application to have the cause heard by the quarterly meeting, let it be permitted, under the same limitations and directions as in cases of offence against the church. Yet it is advised, that all coolly and weightily consider the matter, before they give the meeting so much trouble, and not do it through a perverse, or conten∣tious temper; but only when they have good reason to believe they have just cause so to do, occasioned by want of due information to the arbi∣trators, or manifest mistake, or error in their judgment.</P>
<P>And whereas there may be some cases wherein the foregoing method of proceeding cannot be complied with, such as the parties abscond∣ing with design to defraud their creditors, or being overloaded with debts, and other creditors generally coming on him, the claimant must sustain manifest damage by the time it will take in going through the meet∣ings, or where there may be danger of future damage, as in case of executors or administrators, or such as act in trust; it may therefore be necessary, and it is advised, that the monthly meetings respectively, where such cases happen, and on due enquiry appear truly so, permit, or hold excused those who are really necessiated, in the two first-mentioned ca∣ses, to proceed otherwise: And in the case of executors or administra∣tors, where it shall appear to the meeting, that the matter is of import∣ance, and that it otherwise may be unsafe, and manifestly of dangerous consequence; such may be permitted to have the matter tried at law, or rather first in our friendly way, and then by consent confirmed by a judgment, as the meeting may see occasion upon the matter to advise and direct; with this caution, that the parties on both sides concerned, still appear and behave towards each other in brotherly love; and in the management of the cause, or asserting what they apprehend to be their right, that it be done with decency and moderation, without any pro∣voking, or unbecoming language: For as a bitter indecent behaviour will cause our profession to be evilly spoken of, so on the contrary a christian prudence, and meek deportment, will bear a becoming testimo∣ny even in courts, and shew that nothing but the nature of the case, and our common station with our neighbours under the law of the na∣tion, brings any of us there.</P>
<P>And as it is our duty to seek peace with all men, and to avoid giving provocation, or just offence to any, it is advised, that friends avoid go∣ing
<PB N="7" REF="027023_0006_0FD2F8036EC17B80"/>
to law with others not of our profession, without due consideration, and good grounds; having first in a friendly way shewed his opponent the justice of his cause, and offered, where he safely may, if the other makes any reasonable objection, to submit the matter to a neighbourly reference. That friends, also, give no just occasion to such to go to law with them, but carefully comply with their promises and contracts, and where they have any reason for objection to the demand, that they shew a willingness, and readiness to agree it peaceably between them∣selves, or submit to a reference.</P>

<HEAD>The method to be observed in proceeding in Arbitrations.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. The arbitrators should not consider themselves as advocates for the party by whom they were chosen; but men, whose incumbent duty it is to judge righteously. They should shun all previous information re∣specting the case, that they may not be biassed in their judgments, before they hear both parties together.</P>
<P N="2">2. The parties to enter into written engagements, or bonds in the usual form, if either of them require it, to abide by the award of the ar∣bitrators, or a majority of them, to be made in a limited time.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every meeting of the arbitrators must be made known to the parties concerned, until they have been fully heard; nor shall there be any separate private meetings between some of the arbitrators, or with one party separate from the other on the business referred to them; and no representation of the case of one party, either by writing or otherwise, be admitted, without its being fully made known to the other, and, if required, a copy to be delivered to the other party.</P>
<P N="4">4. The arbitrators are to hear both parties fully, in the presence of each other, whilst either has any fresh matter to offer, until a certain time limited, by mutual agreement. Let no evidence be withheld or rejected.</P>
<P N="5">5. If there should appear to the arbitrators, or to any of them, to be any doubtful point of law, they are jointly to agree upon a case, and con∣sult council thereon. The arbitrators are not required to express in the award their reasons for the decision. One writing of the award is to be sealed, and delivered to each party.</P>
<P>It is recommended to arbitrators to propose to the parties, that they should give an acknowledgment in writing, before the award is made, that they have been candidly and fully heard.</P>

<HEAD>BOOKS.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH are to be dealt with as disorderly, who print or publish any books or writings tending to raise contention, or occasion breach of unity, or that have not first had the perusal and approbation of some friends appointed by the yearly meeting for that purpose.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BURIALS.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas at some burials, where people come far, there may be oc∣casion for some refreshment, yet let that be done with such modera∣tion, gravity, and solidity, as becomes the occasion; and if any appear otherwise, let such be reproved, and dealt with as is advised in cases of misbehaviour, or indecencies at marriages: And it maybe further no∣ted, that any excess in this case, and making so solemn a time as this ought to be, and in its nature really is, appear as a festival, must be burthensome and grievous to the sober christian mind, which will of course, at such times, be under a far different exercise.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CERTIFICATES.</HEAD>
<P>For preserving unity and a good understanding among friends, we desire, that when any friends intend to remove their habitation within the limits of another monthly meeting, that they would first acquaint the monthly meeting thereof whereto they belong, and apply for a cer∣tificate of their good life, conversation and circumstances; and if no objection appear, obtain one to be produced to the monthly meet∣ing, within the limits of which they are going to reside: But if any friends in unity, should remove without making such application, the
<PB N="9" REF="027023_0008_0FD2F7D453EBAF88"/>
meeting should, notwithstanding, send such a certificate as they with truth and justice can give to the meeting, within the limits of which they are removed, that they, by receiving them as they are, may have a proper care of them; and, the meeting from which they removed, may be clear of any reproach their misconduct afterwards may bring on the society. But, before the certificate is given, the meeting should appoint some friends to make the necessary enquiry into the character and conduct of the person, and if any obstruction appear, let it be re∣moved, or the party dealt with according to the circumstances of the case.</P>
<P>When any friends of the ministry purpose to travel in that service, they should first acquaint the monthly meeting to which they belong, for their brotherly advice in that respect, and have a minute or cer∣tificate of the meeting's unity, and concurrence with them in their undertaking, and service as ministers, and that none be permitted to travel abroad and appoint meetings out of the limits of the quarterly meeting they belong to, without such certificate or written approbation.</P>
<P>It is further advised, that copies be kept of all certificates of removal.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CONDUCT and CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>We earnestly beseech our friends, especially the youth, to avoid all such conversation as may tend to draw out their minds into the foolish and wicked pastimes with which this age abounds, (particularly balls, gaming-places, horse-races, and play-houses) those nurseries of debauch∣ery and wickedness, the burthen and grief of the sober part of other societies, as well as of our own; practices wholly unbecoming a people under the christian profession, contrary to the tenor of the doc∣trine of the gospel, and the examples of pious men in all ages. For, as "evil communications corrupt good manners," so it is the duty of men professing religion, who live in this world, in order to obtain a better, not only to "shake their hands from holding of bribes, and stop their ears from hearing of blood;" but also," to shut their eyes from seeing evil." Isa. xxxiii. 15.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="027023_0009_0FD2F81236305850"/>That none accustom themselves to vain and idle company, sipping and tippling of drams, and strong-drink at inns or elsewhere.</P>
<P>That such be dealt with, who are given to excess of drinking, swear∣ing, cursing, lying, unlawful or unseemly company keeping with wo∣men, or any other scandalous practices. And where any professing truth, are guilty of such disorderly or indecent practices, as shall give or occa∣sion public scandal, if they are brought to a sense thereof, either by the overseers or other friends dealing with them as before advised and direct∣ed, or by compunction, or true sight in themselves, such ought as soon as possible, to appear at the monthly meeting to which they belong, and there acknowledge and condemn the offence in writing under their hand, to the satisfaction of the meeting, and that the scandal may be removed, let such acknowledgment or condemnation be published by the said meeting, in such manner as may probably become as public as the offence has been: And where any such offender refuses to acknow∣ledge, and condemn the fault, then the monthly meeting ought speedily to testify upon record, against the party, and the fact, and publish the testimony so far as shall appear requisite for the clearing of truth.</P>
<P>And although there is no reason to disown such offenders as condemn their own scandalous actions to the satisfaction of the meeting, yet such ought not to be immediately accounted as members in full unity; but it is fit that some time should pass for the trial of their sincerity, until friends may become sensible of their real contrition. But if the offence committed, be only against the church, and not a public scandal, ac∣knowledgment, and condemnation by the party under hand, and enter∣ed en the monthly meeting book only, is sufficient, without further pub∣lication; and on the offender's refusal, the meeting ought also, after de∣liberate dealing and due admonition, to testify against the party accord∣ing to the nature of the offence, and enter it on their own minutes, whereby such persons stand disowned, till they shall repent, and give satisfaction.</P>

<HEAD>DAYS and TIMES.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED that friends keep to their wonted example, and testi∣mony against the superstitious observation of days. L. P. E. 1691.</P>
<P>That all friends keep to the simplicity of truth, and our ancient testi∣mony, in calling the months and days by scripture names, and not by heathen. 1697.</P>
<P>We think it may be useful and expedient to revive in your remem∣brance, some of the motives which induced our ancient friends to for∣bear the vulgar appellations of the months and days, and to observe in their conversations, and writings, such names as were agreeable to scrip∣ture, and the practice of good men therein recorded.</P>
<P>The children of Israel, the people whom God chose out of all the families of the earth, to place his name among, and to make himself known unto, were strictly commanded, not only to abstain from the idolatrous practices of the nations in the midst of whom they dwelt, but were enjoined to be " circumspect in all things that the Lord com∣manded," and even to " make no mention of the names of other gods, neither to let it be heard out of their mouth." Exod. xxiii. 13. This injunction was not relative to any legal or typical rites, external cere∣monies, or institutions of the law peculiar to the Jewish nation; but was a perpetual command, and standing ordinance, respecting the ho∣nour of the one Almighty Being, the same yesterday, to-day, and for∣ever; and as such ought to be regarded by us, and by all the generati∣ons of those who with the heart believe, as well as with the tongue con∣fess, " that the Lord he is God, and that there is none else besides him."
<PB N="12" REF="027023_0011_0FD2F7D75170D418"/>
Deut iv. 35. Who hath declared, " I am the Lord, that is my name, and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images." Isaiah xlii. 8. Convinced of this great and everlasting truth, both by the testimony of the holy scripture, and the manifestation of that divine principle, which leads those who are faithful to its teachings, from all that would dishonour the name of God, either in word or deed; our ancient friends were conscientiously concerned to refrain from the use of those names of months, and days, which had been ascribed by way of honour to the idols of the heathen, and in conformity to their false worships: This concern rested upon them from a firm persuasion, that the glorious gospel day, and time was come, wherein the Lord was fulfil∣ling his covenant with Israel, viz. " I will take away the names of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This word Baalim, being the plural number of Baal, signifying Lord, has relation to the names of divers idols of the heathen, worshipped in several places.</NOTE>Baalim out of his mouth, and they shall no more be remembered by their names." Hosea ii. 17.</P>
<P>And that you may the more clearly discern the importance of that christian testimony, borne by our predecessors in this case, we recom∣mend what follows to your serious consideration, viz.</P>
<P>A brief account of the origin of the names of some months of the year, and of all the days of the week, now customarily and common∣ly used.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. January, was so called from Janus, an ancient king of Italy, whom heathenish superstition had deified, to whom a temple was built and this month dedicated.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. February, was so called from Februa, a word denoting purgation by sacrifices; it being usual in this month for the priests of the hea∣then god, Pan, to offer sacrifices, and perform certain rites, conducing, as was supposed, to the cleansing, or purgation of the people.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. March, was so denominated from Mars, feigned to be the god of war, whom Romulus, founder of the Roman empire, pretended to be his father.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. April, is generally supposed to derive its name from the Greek appellation of Venus, an imaginary goddess worshipped by the Romans.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="13" REF="027023_0012_0FD2F7D8ACAD06E8"/>V. May, is said to have been so called, from Maia, the mother of Mercury, another of their pretended ethnic deities, to whom in this month they paid their devotions.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VI. June, is said to take its name from Juno, one of the supposed goddesses of the heathen.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VII. July, so called from Julius Caesar, one of the Roman empe∣rors, who gave his own name to this month, which before was called Quintilis, or the fifth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>VIII. August, so named in honour of Augustus Caesar, another of the Roman emperors; this month was before called Sextilis, or the sixth.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The other four months, namely, September, October, November, December, still retain their numerical Latin names, which according to the late regulation of the Calendar, will for the future be improperly applied, however from the continued use of them hitherto, as well as from the practice of the Jews, before the Babylonish captivity it seems highly probable, that the method of distinguishing the months by their numerical order only, was the most ancient, as it is the most plain, simple, and rational.</P>
<P>As the idolatrous Romans thus gave names to several of the months, in honour of their pretended deities, so the like idolatry prevailing among our Saxon ancestors, induced them to call the days of the week, by the name of the idol, which on that day they peculiarly worshipped. Hence</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>The First day of the week, was by them called Sunday, from their customary adoration of the Sun upon that day.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Second day of the week, they called Monday, from their usual custom of worshipping the Moon on that day.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Third day of the week, they named Tuesday, in honour of one of their idols called Tuisco.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Fourth day of the week, was called Wednesday, from the appel∣lation of Woden, another of their idols.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Fifth day of the week, was called Thursday, from the name of an idol called Thor, to whom they paid their devotions upon that day.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Sixth day of the week, was termed Friday, from the name of Friga, an imaginary goddess by them worshipped.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Seventh day, they stiled Saturday, as is supposed from Saturn, or Seater, by them then worshipped.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="14" REF="027023_0013_0FD2F7B105CC8EE0"/>In the ages of Popish superstition, not only the use of such heathenish names and customs were indulged, but also other unsound and unscrip∣tural practices in religion were invented and introduced. For when the profession of the christian religion became national, multitudes of hea∣then priests, whose interest lay in the performance of rites, ceremo∣nies, and sacrifices, embraced prevailing christianity with selfish views, and laboured early with too much success to find employment for them∣selves, by imposing on the people a new set of ceremonies and sacrifices, bearing some resemblance to those, which in their former state of hea∣thenism they had been accustomed to. From this corrupt source sprang the popish sacrifice of the mass, the celebration of which, at particular times, and on particular occasions, gave rise to the vulgar names of Michaelmas, Martinmas, Christmas, and the like.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore that these appellations and names of days, months, and times, are of an idolatrous or superstitious original, contrary to the divine command, the practice of good and holy men in former ages, and repugnant to the christian testimony borne by our faithful friends and predecessors in the truth, for the sake of which they pati∣ently endured many revilings; let neither the reproach of singularity, nor the specious reasonings of such as would evade the cross of Christ, turn you aside from the simplicity of the gospel, nor discourage you from keeping to the language of truth, in denominating the months and days, according to the plain and scriptural way of expression, thereby following the example of our worthy elders, and coming up in a noble and honourable testimony against these, and all other remains of idola∣try and superstition.</P>
<P>Where there is disagreement in the conduct of friends, respecting the observance of days appointed by the government for fasts, and the illu∣mination of the windows of their houses, upon what are called rejoicing nights, which not only affords occasion of triumph to the enemies of truth, but likewise increases the weight of the sufferings of such friends as are conscientiously concerned to maintain inviolably our ancient and christi∣an testimony in these respects; it is desired and advised, that where a de∣fection of this kind appears, some solid and weighty friends be appointed by the respective monthly meetings, to treat with the unfaithful herein, in a spirit of love and tenderness, in order that such may be awakened to a serious consideration of their duty, and encouraged to a faithful dis∣charge thereof. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>

<HEAD>DISCIPLINE.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED that friends exert good endeavours and care in all meet∣ings of business, for the preservation of good order and wholesome discipline; that their hands slack not therein; that they, every where, may apply to the Lord, who gives wisdom, and will not fail those who seek it in humility and fear, so that overseers and heads of families may be enabled respectively to discharge their duties and trust, in a christian meek spirit, for it is <HI>that</HI> gives weight and success to our labours; let us all therefore guard against the warmth of our own spirits, and let love, the mark of our discipleship, govern in all our behaviour one towards another.</P>
<P>The love and friendship of this world, and spirit of it, covetousness, pride, self-interest and inordinate pursuit after lawful things, not only obstruct the growth of truth in some hearts; but also hinder many from coming forward as they otherwise might do, to carry on the good work of discipline, and perform other offices of love and service in the church of Christ: Let us therefore earnestly seek to the searcher of all hearts, for his divine aid to divest ourselves of these, and all other hindering things, that many more labourers may be fitted and made willing to come forward in this part of the Lord's harvest; that where any are found weak or faulty, they may without partiality be admonished in the spirit of love and divine charity, so that it may be seen by all, that the restoring spirit of meekness and christian love abound before church censure comes, and that a gospel spirit is the spring and motive of all our performances, as well in discipline as worship. But if any decline or let fall any branch of our testimony, they are to be speedily dealt with, according to the good order and discipline established among us. See meetings for discipline.</P>
<P>In order to unite us the more nearly one to another, as members of the same body, and to strengthen our hands to promote the general cause of truth; it is recommended to friends, to stand open to the
<PB N="16" REF="027023_0015_0FD2F8138EF7E0F0"/>
leadings of the love of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord: And when they feel drawings in their minds to sit with any of their neighbouring monthly or quarterly meetings, that they attend thereto; and that such monthly or quarterly meetings as are so visited, receive such as they know to be well approved at home, in the love of God, and not to look upon them as intruders: so shall mutual help be given and received a∣mongst us, and we truly be a people led by one and the same spirit. 1759.</P>
<P>Let a necessary enquiry be raised in the minds of all members of the church, who have had any part of the Lord's work upon them, how they have acquitted themselves therein, and discharged themselves in the sight of God; forasmuch as a day comes on apace, in which an account of our stewardship will be required at our hands. The discipline of the society would again be revived, and strengthened, if this awful sense of rendering an account of our trust, and the importance of being clear from the blood of all men, were enough impressed upon all minds. And, dear friends, as it is the Lord's work, let it be done as in his sight. Let all our answers to the queries be plain and explicit. Let a due sense of the state of the church prevail on your minds, rather than an unwillingness to appear deficient among your brethren. May a suitable engagement of mind prevail on all the active members of the church, to acquit themselves with faithfulness, that they may at last receive the crown of righteousness, which will never fade away.</P>

And when any young ministers give satisfactory proof of their call and qualification to that service, the monthly meeting to which they belong, are desired to recommend them to the care of the quarter∣ly meeting of ministers and elders, and return their names to the said meeting▪</P>
<P>And we earnestly request, that the elders in quarterly and monthly meetings, would be ready to help and inform the weak, when suitable opportunities present, that both ministers and hearers pursuing one and the same end, namely, the glory of God, and the good and welfare one of another, the church may be edified, increase and flourish, to the con∣solation of the faithful.</P>

<HEAD>MARRIAGES.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the advice and direction of this meeting, according to the ap∣proved practice, which has been so long honourable, and the orderly and decent care used among friends, that no man propose his intentions of marriage, or any woman receive or countenance such proposition, where either or both have parents, or guardians, and are under their tu∣ition and care, without first acquainting their parents or guardians there∣with, and duly waiting on them for their consent, and agreement there∣in. And it is also the advice and judgment of this meeting, that where parents or guardians have once consented to, or approved of the visits, and addresses of a man on that account, or to a young woman's admit∣ting of such addresses, that they do not retract without giving such rea∣sons as shall appear sufficient, and to the satisfaction of the monthly meeting to which they belong. If any man or woman so concerned, know of any reasonable or just objection to their proceeding; such as the want of consent of parents, or guardians, pre-engagements, or the want of a certificate where either have resided in another country, or the man belong to another monthly meeting, and is sensible of any cause of difficulty in obtaining one from the said meeting, it is advised that endeavours be used to remove such obstructions to their proceedings, before they propose their intentions of marriage to the monthly meeting.</P>
<P>That all, according to the usual custom, propose their intentions of marriage to two monthly meetings, and that the second time be the next succeeding meeting to the first, unless sickness or some material cause prevents.</P>
<P>The parties intending to join in marriage, are to declare their inten∣tion in terms of the following import, viz. The man: That he intends marriage with <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="2 words" DISP=" _____ _____ "/> if the Lord permit. The woman: That she intends marriage with <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="2 words" DISP=" _____ _____ "/> if the Lord per∣mit. These declarations are to be made first before the women's meet∣ing, and then before the men's.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="027023_0019_0FD2F7B6B4702220"/>At the first meeting, the appearance should be minuted, and en∣quiry made concerning consent of parents or guardians, if either have any; and if the man belongs to the same meeting, two friends appoint∣ed to enquire into his clearness from others, and make report to the next monthly meeting. The like to be done by the women friends con∣cerning the woman. But if either of the parties belong to another monthly meeting, let enquiry be made for a certificate from such meet∣ing of his or her clearness from others in relation to marriage engage∣ments, &amp;c. And where none is produced, let the party be informed, that the marriage cannot be allowed of without one. But if the meet∣ing to which the person belongs is within such distance, that it may pro∣bably be obtained, so as to be produced at the next meeting, and no∣thing else appear to obstruct, it may then pass for the first time.</P>
<P>At the second meeting, if what is above expressed be done, and all appear clear, the parties are then to express, first before the women's meeting, and then before the men's, the continuance of their intention of marriage with each other; then let the entry be made of their second appearance, and the couple left to their liberty to consummate their marriage according to the good order used among friends.</P>
<P>At, or near the conclusion of a meeting, either appointed on pur∣pose, or on the usual week-day, after it has been held the usual time, the parties are to stand up, and taking each other by the hand, declare in an audible and solemn manner, to the following effect; the man first, viz. Friends, in the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Here may be a few more words added if the parties appear in a disposition suitable.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈1 span left blank〉"/> presence of this assembly, I take this my friend <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="2 words" DISP=" _____ _____ "/> to be my wife, promising, with divine assistance, to be to her a loving and faithful husband, till death shall separate us.

<P>It is further pressed and advised, that the said consummation be per∣formed decently and weightily; that the parties themselves, their parents, or others concerned, take care at their houses, or places they are at after the meeting is over, that no reproach arise, or occasion be given by any intemperate or immoderate jesting, drinking, or unseemly wanton dis∣course

or actions; but that all behave with such modesty and sobriety, as becomes a people fearing God. And for the assistance of those immedi∣ately concerned, let the monthly meeting, where the marriage is allowed, appoint two men friends, and two women friends, to attend and take care, as much as they can, that all behave as is above advised; and if any thing to the contrary is observed, let them, as soon as they can with con∣veniency, and decency, take such as make such breach on good order, moderation or modesty, aside, and in love and tenderness admonish and caution them to better behaviour, and to be more watchful over their words and actions: And the said friends are to make report to the next monthly meeting, respecting the decency and order observed at the mar∣riage; and the monthly meeting is also to take the needful care that the certificate be properly recorded in a book to be kept for that purpose.</P>
<P>It is advised that friends avoid all unnecessary preparations and invitati∣ons at marriages.</P>
<P>Inasmuch as any marriage of near kindred, in the times of the law, was in condescension, and upon such extraordinary occasions as holding up their tribes, and that the nearer their marriages were the more unholy they were accounted; we, in our day, ought not to approach our near kindred in any such respect, particularly first cousins, being redeemed out of those kindreds, tribes, and earthly lots; (for the upholding of which marriages within the kindred were once dispensed with) and brought to that spiritual dispensation, which gives dominion over the affections, and leads to those marriages which are more natural and of better report.</P>
<P>And though some through weakness, have been drawn into such mar∣riages, (which being done must not be broken) yet let not their practices be a precedent, or example to any others amongst us for the time to come.</P>
<P>Monthly meetings ought to be careful in passing or allowing of marri∣ages of near kindred; and, where any uneasiness in this respect appears, take the advice of the yearly meeting thereon, rather than proceed in doubtful cases.</P>

<HEAD>MEETINGS for WORSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>AS it hath been our care and practice from the beginnings, that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> open testimony for the Lord should be borne, and a public stand∣ard for truth and righteousness upheld in the power and spirit of God, by our open and known meetings, against the spirit of persecution, that in all ages hath sought to lay waste God's heritage, and as only through faithfulness, constancy, and patience, victory hath been and is obtained, so it is our advice and judgment, that all friends gathered in the name of Jesus, keep up these public testimonies in their respective places, and not decline, forsake, or remove their public assemblies, because of times of sufferings, as worldly, fearful and politic professors have done, be∣cause of informers and the like persecutors; for such practices are not consistent with the nobility of the truth, and therefore not to be owned in the church of Christ.</P>
<P>As it hath pleased divine goodness clearly to manifest amongst us the way of life and salvation, and to instruct us where and how to wait for him, prize, we beseech you, these precious privileges, keep all your meetings in the name of the Lord, and let your minds be esta∣blished in an humble waiting upon him with reverence and fear; so shall strength be added to strength, and being more closely united to him, you will experience the indwelling of his blessed spirit.</P>
<P>When gathered in your religious assemblies, be truly concerned to retire to the divine and heavenly gift, which will minister to every state and condition, though you may perhaps have no outward teaching, and will direct you to wait without being restless or uneasy, till it be a proper time to break up your meetings with that decency and solemni∣ty, which should attend our minds in such service; and be not apt, as the manner of some is, at the close of your meetings, hastily to enter into discourses about the affairs of this life, much less the vain amuse∣ments thereof; a practice inconsistent with that christian gravity, which at such time ought, in an especial manner, to season the minds of per∣sons so lately assembled for the worship of God in spirit and in truth.</P>

<HEAD>MEETINGS for DISCIPLINE.</HEAD>
<P>AGREED, that no quarterly meeting be set up, or laid down without the consent of the yearly meeting; no monthly, prepa∣rative, or other meeting of business, or worship, without application to, and consent of the quarterly meeting.</P>
<P>These meetings are subordinate, and accountable to each other in the following order, viz. The preparative to the monthly, the monthly to the quarterly, and the quarterly to the yearly meeting: So that if the yearly meeting is at any time dissatisfied with the proceedings of any of the said meetings, or the quarterly with that of the monthly, or the monthly with the preparative, within their limits, such meetings ought respectively, with readiness to render a satisfactory account.</P>
<P>Let each preparative meeting choose two men friends, and two wo∣men friends, to attend the monthly meeting, and present on behalf, and by order of said preparative meeting, what shall be given in charge; each monthly meeting a sufficient number, to attend the quarterly meet∣ing to which they belong, and present on behalf of the respective monthly meeting, what shall be given them in charge, which ought to be in writing and for the like service let each quarterly meeting ap∣point at least four friends of each sex, as representatives to the yearly meeting.</P>
<P>Let minutes, or due entries be made in every monthly, and quarter∣ly meeting, of all such matters as come before them, and are determi∣ned, or that may be removed from the monthly to the quarterly, or from that to the yearly meeting.</P>
<P>Let all marriages, marriage-certificates, births and burials, be record∣ed in each monthly meeting; also an account of friends sufferings, for their testimony against hireling ministers, and war, which ought to be transferred to the quarterly, and from thence to the yearly meeting.</P>
<P>If any monthly or quarterly meeting have occasion for, and request any of the records of another monthly or quarterly meeting, it is desi∣red that the meeting so requesting may be furnished with such copies.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="027023_0024_0FD2F8155AB835C0"/>That full endeavours be used in every monthly meeting, to end, with the utmost dispatch, all business that arises or is brought for their determination, and if any matter be referred from one meeting to ano∣ther, let the reason be minuted why it is referred; but if they find any thing too weighty or inconvenient for them to determine, they may move it to the quarterly meeting, and after due care and endeavours to end any matter, or difference, the quarterly meeting may move it to the yearly meeting.</P>
<P>The method of dealing with disorderly persons, or such as give of∣fence, either to the church, or particular members, is very excellently prescribed by the saviour of mankind. Matthew, xviii. 15, 16, 17.
<Q>If thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault be∣tween thee and him alone, if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother; but if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word, may be established, and if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it to the church; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to thee as an heathen man, and a publican.</Q></P>
<P>The eminent apostle in his epistle to the Philippians, has these ex∣pressions: Chap. iv. 8.
<Q>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, if there be any praise, think, on these things.</Q>
Now whatsoever appears in any contrary to these, may in general, be said to come under the notice of friends, overseers, and meeting. And although it is a duty incumbent on meetings, and every faithful member, where any discords, or unbecoming practices come to their knowledge, to advise, admonish, or treat with such as are guilty, yet that it may not be neglected, it ought to be, more par∣ticularly and directly the business and service of the overseers.</P>
<P>And it is advised, that in speaking to, or dealing with any, it may be done in a christian spirit of love and tenderness, by laying the evil before them, labouring in meekness to bring such to a sense of it in themselves, that they may, if possible, be restored. And although such as transgress or loose their hold of truth are apt, while in that condition, to oppose or be testy; yet we ought patiently and meekly to instruct
<PB N="26" REF="027023_0025_0FD2F7B85029B200"/>
and advise them, so that we may not only have a testimony of peace in ourselves, but may so affect the spirits of those to whom we speak, as that they may be sensible we have performed a truly christian duty to∣wards them in brotherly love; after which tender dealing, if any reject the admonition or counsel, the overseers or such as deal with them, are to acquaint the preparative meeting thereof, that further care may be taken, according to the established rule among friends.</P>
<P>Besides, all other notorious crimes or gross wickedness, if any happen, the following practices ought zealously to be taken care of and sup∣pressed, viz. Excessive drinking, swearing, cursing, lying, unlawful or unseemly keeping company with women, or any other scandalous practices.</P>
<P>And it is the business of the overseers, or other weighty friends, to speak to, or deal with such as are at difference or strife, either about their interest in worldly affairs, or other resentments, advising an agree∣ment among themselves and speedy reconciliation, to avoid if possible, bringing any troublesome business to meetings which may be otherwise ended; but if they cannot prevail, they are then to take the methods prescribed for proceeding in such case.—See conduct and conversation.</P>
<P>Such as frequently neglect, or do not in due time, attend meetings, those on week-days as well as first-days, but stay away on light trivial, or ordinary occasions; a constant, or frequent neglect being a mark of declension, and when it becomes remarkable, such should be more ear∣nestly dealt with and admonished; also, if any, old or young, when come to meeting fall asleep, go out and in frequently, or otherwise dis∣turb the meeting, let them be rebuked and cautioned, first privately, and all parents, masters and mistresses ought to have a care over their children and servants in that respect, and caution them accordingly.</P>
<P>Such as keep company in order for marriage with those not of our profession, or with any servant or apprentice without the consent of the master or mistress. Such as marry out of the unity of friends, or any method but the decent and orderly way used amongst friends. Such as go themselves, or suffer their children to go to marriages consumma∣ted contrary to the rules of our discipline, either of those that have professed with us, or those of other societies, without giving a satisfac∣tory reason for their going, as the levity and wanton behaviour too frequently at such times, may be a means of corrupting the minds of
<PB N="27" REF="027023_0026_0FD2F81BD5BE3920"/>
youth, and strengthening them in that disorder which is not consist∣ent with our holy profession. Such as do not keep themselves and their children to moderation and plainness, in jesture, speech and apparel, in furniture of houses, and such things as have been cautioned against, either by the yearly meeting in London, or the yearly meeting here. Such as trade by sea or land, or buy or contract beyond their abilities, and such as keep not their words or engagements in their dealing, these being a reproach to truth, and a manifest injury, are to be speedi∣ly advised, and if they do not amend they are further to be proceeded against. Such as run races on horse-back, or on foot, lay wages, or use any gaming, or needless and vain sports and pastimes. Such as do not maintain our ancient christian testimonies against taking oaths, mi∣litary services, bearing arms, clandestine or illicit trade, purchasing prize goods, and being concerned in lotteries of any kind. Such as are guilty of tattling, tale-bearing, reproaching, back-biting, evil∣speaking of their brethren or neighbours, or busily meddling with the affairs of others, where they are not concerned; the tendency of which being to raise strife and discord, or cause disesteem among brethren and neighbours. Such as write, print, or publish, any books or writ∣ings, tending to raise contention, or occasion breach of unity, that have not first had the approbation of some friends appointed by the yearly meeting for that purpose. If any shall take upon them pub∣lickly to oppose any ministring friend (in unity, or not disowned) in exhortation, or preaching; keep on the hat, or shew any other remark∣able dislike in time of prayer, let them be speedily dealt with as dis∣orderly persons, who endanger the peace, and oppose the charity and brotherhood of the church, unless they condemn the same in such manner as the meeting may think requisite; but if they have any rea∣sonable objection against what was delivered, they are first to speak to the friend privately, and proceed orderly.</P>

<HEAD>MINISTERS.</HEAD>
<P>MINISTERS are to be approved by the monthly meeting of which they are members, and by them recommended before they are permitted to sit in the meetings of ministers and elders, or to travel abroad as ministers.</P>
<P>The spirit of God being the foundation of all true knowledge and experience, both in ministers and hearer, we earnestly exhort that all would diligently wait upon and mind it: Ministers, in their public ser∣vices especially, ought always to attend closely to their several and pe∣culiar gifts, and minister the word faithfully as it is manifested and re∣vealed to them; observing a decent and modest behaviour, in the exer∣cise of their ministrv, and not entangling; themselves with the affairs of this life, that they may the better answer the holy warfare in which they are engaged, and let the hearers be watchful over their own spirits, and not forwardly judge, or censure the testimonies which may be delivered amongst them; for if they be not very careful and diligent in attending upon the Lord in meetings, they are liable to mistake in the judgment they may pass on the ministry.</P>
<P>Now this being a matter of great moment, for the preservation of love and concord, in the churches; and knowing the danger and ill consequences, which attend a hasty and censorious judging of the mi∣nistry, we think it necessary to caution friends not to let their own spi∣rits sway them, but let the spirit of God rule and reign in their hearts; for this will preserve all in sweetness, and tenderness one towards another: The due observance of which, will be a great help to ministers in the discharge of their duty, and the service to which they are called.</P>
<P>We further advise all monthly meetings, to take great care in giving certificates to those who travel, to prevent the uneasiness which some∣times falls on the church, from a weak and unskilful ministry; and let the elders, when they see occasion, advise ministers to be very prudent in their conduct, not as busy-bodies, nor meddling with family, or per∣sonal
<PB N="29" REF="027023_0028_0FD2F81F58762560"/>
affairs, in which they are not concerned, or required to be assist∣ing; that they be very tender of one another's reputation, and that of friends among whom they travel; neither giving ear to, nor spreading reports tending to raise in the minds of others a disesteem of any; and as soon as their service in the ministry is over, that they return to their habitations, and there take a reasonable and prudent care of their own business, household, and family.</P>
<P>That there be held in each monthly meeting, a select meeting of ministers and elders, once in three months; when being met together, after some time spent in solid retirement, they may proceed to read and consider the queries annexed, and form general answers, to the first, se∣cond and third quarterly meetings of ministers and elders; but to the quarterly meeting preceding the yearly meeting, they should all be clear∣ly and distinctly answered, and as near in the words of the query as may be; that a suitable number be appointed as representatives to the quar∣terly meeting, and by the quarterly meeting, to the yearly meeting of ministers and elders.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="queries">
<HEAD>QUERIES of the MEETING of MINISTERS and ELDERS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. Are ministers and elders careful duly to attend all their meetings for worship and discipline, manifesting a religious care to encourage their families in that important duty, and are they good examples in humble waiting therein, in not giving way to drowsiness?</P>
<P N="2">II. Are ministers found in word and doctrine, careful to minister in divine ability, and thereby kept from burthening the living?</P>
<P N="3">III. Are the lives and conversations of ministers and elders clean and blameless amongst men? are they in unity one with another, and the meeting they belong to, harmoniously labouring together for truth's honour, and careful to give no just occasion of offence to any?</P>
<P N="4">IV. Do they rule their own families well, bringing them up in plain∣ness which truth requires, in dress, language, and true moderation, and are they themselves good examples in those respects?</P>
<P N="5">V. Are they peace-makers in families and in the church, not con∣cerned in raising or spreading evil reports, or busy-bodies where they have no proper business.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="30" REF="027023_0029_0FD2F7B8E47E9338"/>VI. Are they careful to maintain the discipline in every part there∣of, not even to hide their own families from truth's judgment, if occa∣sion be given, but impartially to minister justice, as faithful servants.</P>
<P>It is also recommended, that ministers and elders, watch over one another for good, helping those who are exercised in the ministry in the right line; discouraging forward spirits that run into words without life and power; advising against affectation of tones, gestures, and eve∣ry thing that would hurt their service; yet encouraging the humble, careful traveller, speaking a word in season to them that are weary; and let all dwell in that which gives ability to labour successfully in the church of Christ; adorning the doctrine they deliver to others; being examples to the believers, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, and in purity.</P>

<P>Where any members refuse to execute proper instruments of writing, for releasing from a state of slavery, such as are in their power, or on whom they have any claim, whether arrived to full age, or, in their mi∣nority, and no hopes of the continuance of friends labour being profi∣table to them, monthly meetings after having discharged a christian du∣ty to such should testify their disunion with them. P. 1776.</P>
<P>N. B. It is recommended that a regular record be kept of the ma∣numissions already executed, and of such as may hereafter be executed, for slaves set at liberty, in a book to be provided for that purpose, by each monthly meeting, where there is occasion for such record.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="027023_0030_0FD2F7BBE51C7D00"/>It is also the solid sense and judgment of this meeting, that friends ought not by any means, to be concerned in hireing any of those who are held as slaves, where the wages are to be received by those who claim a right to hold them as such; that friends be careful not to act as overseers, where slaves are put under their care, and as it is necessa∣ry we should be uniform in our conduct respecting the time of granting slaves their freedom, it is our sense and judgment, that the age of twenty-one for males, and eighteen for females, ought to be strictly observed.

Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</Q>— Matt. v. 33—37.</P>

<HEAD>PLAINNESS.</HEAD>
<P>Advised that friends take care to keep to truth, and plainness in lan∣guage, habit, deportment, and behaviour; that the simplicity of truth in these things, may not wear out, or be lost in our days, nor in those of our posterity.</P>
<P>Let all be examples to their children in wisdom, moderation and plainness in language and habit; and not exemplary only, but also re∣strain them from any thing that might be to their hurt; neither provid∣ing for them costly and gaudy attire, unbecoming godliness, nor letting them have money to gratify themselves therein.</P>
<P>It is our concern to exhort all friends, both men and women, to watch against the growing sin of pride, and beware of adorning them∣selves in a manner disagreeable to the plainness and simplicity of the truth, we make profession of.</P>
<P>As vain habits and needless fashions frequently change; so the vain and wanton mind in our youth, and others, is too apt to be taken with them; it is therefore hoped, and presumed, that as such things shall ap∣pear, friends will be stirred up in the wisdom of truth, to take due and prudent care therein.</P>

<HEAD>PRIESTS WAGES.</HEAD>
<P>Let us ever keep in remembrance, that it is under the immediate teaching and influence of the holy spirit, that all acceptable worship is performed, and all true gospel ministry supplied; that this pure and powerful influence, in vessels sanctified and prepared by the divine hand, is the essential qualification to that work; that as the gift is divine,
<PB N="33" REF="027023_0032_0FD2F7E9782BF588"/>
the service is freely and faithfully to be discharged, without any view to reward from man; and therefore should we voluntarily, either by open or collusive means, contribute to the maintenance of such as preach for hire; we should be guilty of inconsistency in practice, by supporting, as ministers of Christ, those whom we do not believe to be sent by him, and upholding them in a conduct contrary to his command, which is, "Freely ye have received, freely give." Matt. x. 8. And this practi∣cal opposition to his gospel law, we cannot but look upon as denying him before men, and therefore in us anti-christian.</P>

<HEAD>QUERIES.</HEAD>
<P>It is the sense and judgment of the yearly meeting, that it will tend to the benefit of the society, to have the following queries read and an∣swered, in the quarterly, monthly, and preparative meetings:</P>
<P N="1">I. Are all meetings for worship and discipline duly attended; the hour observed, and are friends preserved from all unbecoming behaviour therein?</P>
<P N="2">II. Are friends careful to maintain love and unity as becomes the followers of Christ? are tale-bearing, back-biting, and spreading evil re∣ports discouraged, and where any differences arise, are endeavours used speedily to end them?</P>
<P N="3">III. Are friends careful to bring up those under their direction, to the due attendance of meetings, to plainness of speech, behaviour and apparel; in frequently reading the holy scriptures; to restrain them from reading pernicious books, and the corrupt conversation of the world?</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="34" REF="027023_0033_0FD2F7BE6F050878"/>IV. Are friends careful to live within the bounds of their circum∣stances, to avoid involving themselves in business beyond their ability to manage? are they just in their dealings, and punctual in fulfilling their contracts; and where any give reasonable ground of fear in these res∣pects, are they timely laboured with for their preservation or recovery: And where any have failed, is there a strict enquiry made into their con∣duct, and are they dealt with according to our discipline?</P>
<P N="5">V. Do you bear a faithful testimony against a hireling ministry, taking or administering oaths, military services, being concerned in any fraudulent or clandestine trade, purchasing prize-goods, or encouraging lotteries of any kind?</P>
<P N="6">VI. Are friends careful to settle their outward affairs, and make their wills in time of health, to inspect the necessities of the poor, to relieve and assist them in such business as they are capable of; do their children freely partake of learning, to fit them for business; and are they, and other friends children, placed among friends?</P>
<P N="7">VII. Are friends clear of importing, vending, distilling, and the un∣necessary use of spirituous liquors; frequenting places of diversion, or taverns unnecessarily; and do they keep to moderation and temperance on all occasions?</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Are friends careful to bear a testimony against slavery; do they provide in a suitable manner, for those under their direction, who have had their freedom secured; and are they instructed in use∣ful learning?</P>
<P N="9">IX. Do you take due care to deal with all offenders in the spirit of meekness and wisdom, without partiality or unnecessary delay?</P>
<P>That the first, second, and ninth queries, be answered in the first, second, and third quarters; and that they all, with the four following, be answered at the quarterly meeting preceding the yearly meeting; and that such answers be clear and distinct, and as near in the words of the query as may be.</P>

<HEAD>INSTITUTION of the MEETING for SUFFERINGS, for the YEARLY MEETING in MARYLAND.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the <HI>YEARLY MEETING</HI> now Sitting in <HI>BALTIMORE.</HI></HEAD>
<LETTER>
<P>THE united committees of the yearly meeting having met, and solidly attended to the several matters to them referred, agree to propose, first, that a meeting for sufferings be instituted, and appointed agreeable to the sense of the meeting yesterday expressed: That the said meeting be composed of eight solid, faithful friends, to be named out of the yearly meeting at large, and four friends, to be appointed by each quarterly meeting as their representatives therein.</P>
<P>The said meeting for sufferings are to exercise care, and interpose in such cases where the testimony of truth may be affected, and also to advise and assist friends who may be brought under sufferings for the testimony of a good conscience: To examine and adjust the accounts of sufferings for our religious testimony, after the same have been approv∣ed by the monthly and quarterly meetings where they arise: To exa∣mine and correct memorials concerning deceased friends, preparatory to their being laid before the yearly meeting, and also examine and correct such manuscripts and writings respecting our religious testimony, and principles, as are intended for publication, and to suppress such as may be improper, or not thought necessary to publish; and also to direct the re-printing and distribution of such books as they may think ex∣pedient and useful; and generally to exercise vigilance and care on all occasions where our religious testimony may be advanced or affected; and also, as wisdom may direct, to hold a brotherly correspondence with such other meetings for sufferings as are, or may be established under the authority of any other yearly meeting of our religious soci∣ety, and appear on our behalf, on all occasions, during the recess of the yearly meeting. Also, to give attention to the temporal concerns of the society as occasions may require, and from time to time to draw on the treasurer of the yearly meeting, for such sums as may be necessa∣ry in the course of the discharge of the trust in them reposed.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="027023_0037_0FD2F7F16EE03A98"/>But the said meeting is not to have power, or authority, to alter or vary from the rules and discipline of the society, as established by the yearly meeting; but are to be governed as a subordinate meeting by the rules of the body, and every year to lay the minutes of their proceed∣ings before the yearly meeting of business, who have a right to conti∣nue, or discontinue, the said meeting for sufferings, and to approve or disapprove their proceedings; and generally to give instructions and ad∣vice to said meeting as occasions may require.</P>
<P>It is also proposed, that said meeting be held quarterly, and alternate∣ly at Baltimore and Pipe-Creek, viz. At Baltimore the second day af∣ter the quarterly meeting, in the second and eighth months, at the tenth hour in the morning; and at Pipe-Creek the sixth day before the quar∣terly meeting, in the fifth and eleventh months, at the same hour, with liberty to meet on their own adjournments, or call a special meeting when any four of the members of the said meeting shall judge it ne∣cessary.</P>
<P>That the stile of said meeting be, " The Meeting for Sufferings for the Yearly Meeting in Maryland," and that a less number than eight friends, be not authorised to hold such meeting.</P>

<HEAD>SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS.</HEAD>
<P>A weighty concern being revived, on consideration of the pernicious effects of the use of spirituous liquors, on the morals and health of the people of this country; although it appears on the account given, that the members of our religious society in general, are preserved from in∣temperance;
<PB N="39" REF="027023_0038_0FD2F803736472C8"/>
it is nevertheless earnestly recommended to friends indivi∣dually, to forbear being in any respect accessary to the promotion of the sorrowful consequences which are observable by the use of this article; either by importing, or seiling it in less or larger quantities; or in the unnecessary distillation thereof from grain or other produce; and as it has heretofore been made use of in the time of harvest, to the manifest injury of the labourers, many brethren have, of late years, found it expedient to forbear the use of it at that time, and express much satis∣faction therein. And by substituting cooling liquors in stead thereof, the labourers in the field, have been enabled to perform their work with more real advantage to themselves and their employers. It is therefore desired, that quarterly and monthly meetings may dwell under a religious con∣cern, and care for the advancement of our christian testimony against this evil; whereby we may become instruments of good to others by convincing them of the destructive tendency of the practice, and lead them to refrain it.</P>

<HEAD>TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED, that none launch into trade and worldly business be∣yond what they can manage honestly, and with reputation; so that they may keep their words with all men, that their yea, may prove yea indeed, and their nay, nay; for whatsoever is otherwise com∣eth of evil; and that they use few words in their dealings, lest they bring dishonour to the truth of God through their forwardness; and such who make themselves guilty, by thus dishonouring God, and the holy profession of his name and truth, are for judgment, and the judgment of truth ought to be set over them, that those who abide and walk in the truth may be clear of their iniquities. L. 1675.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>WAR.</HEAD>
<P>With desires for the present and future prosperity of truth amongst us, and the preservation of individuals, on the true foundation of our christian fellowship and communion; we advise friends not to accept of, or continue in the exercise of any office or station in civil government, by which they may in any respect be subjected to the necessity of enforc∣ing the compliance of their brethren, or others, with any act which they conscientiously scruple to perform; and if any professing with us, should after the advice and admonitions of their brethren, persist in a con∣duct so repugnant to that sincerity, uprightness, and self-denial, incum∣bent on us, it is the sense and judgment of this meeting, that such should not be allowed to sit in our meetings of discipline, nor be em∣ployed in the affairs of truth, till they are brought to a sense and ac∣knowledgment of their error. P. 1758.</P>
<P>We also earnestly and affectionately desire that friends in all places, may be particularly careful to live near the divine principle, which, if faithfully attended to, and followed, will preserve us in a conduct be∣coming

our holy profession, and teach us to avoid mixing with those in their human policy and contrivance, who are not convinced of our reli∣gious principles, and to seek after quietude and calmness of mind, in order that under the direction of true wisdom, we may be enabled to administer advice to any of our brethren, who may be inadvertently drawn aside to join with, or countenance by conversation, or otherwise, the commotions prevailing; thus we may demonstrate to the world, our regard to our christian testimony and profession, and give no just occa∣sion to any of accusing us, of deviating from the principles and conduct of our worthy predecessors, who in times of the greatest difficulties, ma∣nifested union among themselves, and that they steadily preferred the cause and reputation of truth to every other consideration.

<HEAD>WILLS.</HEAD>
<P>It is recommended that care be taken in each monthly meeting, that friends who have estates to dispose of, be advised to make their wills in time of health, and strength of judgment, and to dispose of their sub∣stance, as in justice and wisdom may be to their satisfaction; to prevent the inconveniencies, loss, and trouble that may fall upon their relations and friends, through their dying intestate.</P>

<P>Advised, that the quarterly meetings be careful annually to depute such friends to attend the service of the yearly meeting, as are of good report, and diligent attenders of meetings for discipline at home, whose practice and conversation is answerable to the testimony they profess to bear, men known to be faithful and conscientious.</P>
<P>That no representative withdraw from the yearly meeting, or any other meeting for discipline, before the meeting ends, without leave first requested and granted, that the service of such meetings may not be neglected.</P>
