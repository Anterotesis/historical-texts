<HEAD>THOUGHTS CONCERNING THE GOSPEL, &amp;C.</HEAD>
<P>IN attending to a sermon, some things occurred which brought a passage in the Epistle to the Collosians, to re∣membrance, 'say to Archippus, take heed to the ministry that thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfill it;' which produced an inquiry, who Archippus was; and com∣paring the Epistle to the Collosians, with that to Philemon, it appeared probable, that Philemon, Epaphras and Archip∣pus were ministers of the church of Christ, gathered from among the Collosians, which then met in Philemon's house; both Epistles appear to be wrote and sent at the same time; however, Archippus was a minister of the church of Christ, who received his ministry in the Lord, and yet was the sub∣ject of this exhortation: Hence it was concluded that no minister of Christ is above receiving a similar exhortation from the brethren.</P>
<P>The next inquiry was, what was the ministry he received in the Lord, or which the ministers of Christ receive in the Lord; supposing they receive the same now, as the minis∣ters of the first Churches did?</P>
<P>In answer, it may be said, that their commission was, 'to go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.' It is agreed that the word gospel, signifies good news, glad tidings: The Prophet and Apostles agree herein. The Prophet Isaiah saith, 'O Zion that bringeth good tid∣ings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength, lift up, be not affraid: Say to the cities of Judah, behold you God. How beautiful are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, that bringeth good tid∣ings of good; that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, thy God reigneth.' And similar is the word which God sent to the children of Israel; with which Peter was sent to the Gentiles, 'preaching peace, by Jesus Christ, he is Lord of all.'</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="024860_0005_0FCD6BE6CCE894A8"/>The scriptures do not leave us at a loss, respecting these glad tidings, 'for the scriptures foreseeing that God would justify the heathen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The heathen that had no claim as being of the stock of Israel that had no worthi∣ness, nothing to recommend them.</NOTE> through faith, preached before the gos∣pel unto Abraham, saying in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;' the same gospel is repeated to Isaac, and confirmed to Jacob, and is proclaimed from the top of Jacob's ladder, where the Lord stood above it, and said, 'I am the God of Abraham, thy father, and the God of Isaac;' this was also shown to Moses at the bush, and when he was sent to the children of Israel, he was directed to say unto them, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; this is my name forever, and my me∣morial unto all generations. It is my unchangable name, the unchangable name; of the unchangable God; insuring blessedness in Christ Jesus, to all the nations, kin∣dreds, and families of the earth. And a believer of this gospel preached to Abraham, enters into rest; although he is in himself a poor, lost, wretched, miserable sinner, and understanding himself blessed in Christ Jesus, can rejoice in him, though he hath 'no confidence in the flesh.'</P>
<P>The prophet Isaiah speaking of the Gentiles, in his 54th chapter, says to them, 'fear not for thou shall not be asham∣ed, neither be thou confounded, for thou shall not be put to shame, for thou shall forget the shame of thy youth, and shall not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more: FOR thy Maker is thy husband, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel, the God of the whole earth shall he be called.' The Prophet Jeremiah, in his 3d chapter, speaking of Judah and Israel, saith 'turn O backsliding children, saith the Lord, for I am married unto you.' And the Pro∣phet Isaiah, appears to be speaking both of Jews and Gen∣tiles, when he says 'as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.'</P>
<P>If the nations, kindreds and families of the earth are blessed in Christ Jesus, and both Jews and Gentiles acknow∣ledged as married unto him, then he is 'the God of the whole earth.'</P>
<P>Again, the whole earth are repeatedly called to sing a new song unto the Lord, as we see in Psalm, 96 1, 98 1,
<PB N="7" REF="024860_0006_0FCD6BE84A590088"/>
Isaiah, 42, 10, 11. This new song is described, Rev. 5, 9, 'thou art worthy for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God, by thy blood, out of every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people:' If all the earth are called to sing this new song, surely all the earth are interested in the subject matter of it.</P>
<P>Again, the most opposed to the salvation of the gospel, and the preaching of it, are the subjects of prayer. The Psalmist, speaking in the person of Christ, in the 42d Psalm, where he complains of his reproachers, saying 'my tears have been my meat, day and night, while they continually say unto me, where is thy God?' And adds, 'when I remember these, I pour out my soul in me.' This we see verified when they said 'he trusted in God, let him deliver him if he will have him;' and hear Jesus Christ pour out his soul in him, in that prayer 'father forgive them for they know not what they do;' he also directs his Disciples 'to love their enemies, and pray for them that despitefully use them.' Did he direct them to love those whom he did not; did he not die that his enemies might be reconciled by his death; was not he always heard, and did he bid his disciples pray for what should not be granted?</P>
<P>Then surely the gospel also is to be preached to them, and this good news is to be published as a truth among such characters, 'that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them;' agreeable to the prophet Isaiah, 'I have blotted out thy transgressions as a cloud, and thine iniquities as a thick cloud, return unto me for I have redeemed thee.'</P>
<P>Designed brevity, forbids the taking notice of many con∣siderations that offer themselves, to prove and illustrate this truth, that Christ's ministers, commission is, 'to preach the gospel to every creature.' Two or three things offer themselves as inquiries or objections, as</P>
<P>1st. If the nations are blessed in Christ Jesus, both <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Gentiles, so that they are married unto him, and he is the God of the whole earth, whence is it such a place of sin and misery?</P>
<P>It may be said, if the woman interested in the estate and honours of her husband, treacherously depart from him,
<PB N="8" REF="024860_0007_0FCD6BEA5AFE04D8"/>
every step of her way, must be going further into the sink of sin and misery.</P>
<P>That this was the case with antient Israel, is plain from Jeremiah 3, 20, 'surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so have you dealt treacherously with me O house of Israel,' which will be evident to any one that reads the beginning of the chapter, to the 12 verse, and Ezekiel, 16, 32, 45; and as this was the cause of the distress and misery, that befel antient Israel, so it is the cause of all the calamities that befal us all, in copying after their wretched example. Certainly there is no want of blessed∣ness in Christ Jesus; no want of power, riches, loving kindness and mercy, in our Maker, our Husband, the God of the whole earth; but all our unhappiness arises from our alienation from him, and the further we pursue that path, the greater our misery and calamity, whether we know the cause or not.</P>
<P>Now if the husband of the treacherously departing wife, own her to be his wife, call after her to return, is willing and ready to receive her on her return, without upbraid∣ing her, she is certainly blessed in a husband <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The gospel, the Apostles preached was, 'that God was <HI>in</HI> Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, 1 Corinthians, v, 19. Agreeable to the gospel preached to Abraham, that' <HI>in</HI> thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, Galatians, iii, 8, 16. The Psalmist saith, 'men shall be blessed <HI>in</HI> him, Psalm, lxxii, 17. The prophet saith, 'the nations shall bless themselves <HI>in</HI> him, and <HI>in</HI> him shall they glory,' Jeremiah, iv, 2. By the Apostle we are said to be 'chosen <HI>in</HI> him,' Ephesians, i, 4. 'To be justified <HI>in</HI> him, 1 Corinthians, vi, 11. 'To be ga∣thered together <HI>in</HI> him.' Ephesians, i, 10. 'To be rooted and built up <HI>in</HI> him,' Collos∣sians, ii, 7. 'To be sanctified <HI>in</HI> Christ Jesus,' 1 Corinthians, i, 2. 'To be blessed with all spiritual blessings <HI>in</HI> Christ Jesus, Ephesians, i, 3. 'To be made to sit togethed in heavenly places, <HI>in</HI> Christ Jesus,' Ephesians, ii, 6. 'All the promises of God are <HI>in</HI> him, yea and <HI>in</HI> him amen.' 2 Corinthians, i, 20. 'And yea are compleat <HI>in</HI> him,' Collosians. ii. 10. 'And we are <HI>in</HI> him, that is true <HI>in</HI> his son Jesus Christ,' 1 John, v, 20. Being blessed <HI>in</HI> him, denotes union as members to their head 'all men being drawn to him when he was lifted up; and so one dying for all, all died; he tasting death for every man.' Therefore this gospel preached to Abraham, and preached by the Apostles is to he preached to those that are the most remote from blessedness in themselves and when it is believed they are led to rejoice <HI>in</HI> Christ Jesus, though altogether destitute in themselves, unbelief and alienation, being the source of all our misery, believing the truth as it is <HI>in</HI> Jesus, we see our blessedness <HI>in</HI> him.</NOTE> though she forsakes her own mercies for lying vanities, and is most forlorne and miserable in herself, while persisting in her alienation,</P>
<P>I need only repeat two passages of scripture, to lead our minds from the similitude just mentioned up to divine mercy. Jeremiah, iii, 1, 'but thou hast played the harlot
<PB N="9" REF="024860_0008_0FCD6BECC33D8F30"/>
with many lovers, yet return unto me saith the Lord', verse 12, 'return thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not return <HI>and</HI> I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you as a condition; the <HI>and</HI> is supplied by the translators, it is return I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you.</NOTE> I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you. Isaiah xlii, 22, 'I have blotted out as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and as a cloud thy sins; return unto me, for I have redeemed thee.' Thus gospel ministers have the testimony of God, by his Prophets, as well as the commission given to the Apostles, 'to preach the gospel to every creature.'</P>
<P>2dly. It may be inquired, are not ministers to preach the law? Answer, 'by the law is the knowledge of sin, for what things the law saith, it saith to them that are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God, having no hope but in the righteousness of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, revealed in the gospel.' The direction therefore, is 'to preach the gos∣pel to every creature.'</P>
<P>There were some in the Apostles' day, that desired to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm. The Apostle says, 'the law was our school-master unto, or until Christ,' (to bring us, is sup∣plied by the translators) 'that we might be justified by faith; but when faith is come, we are no longer under a school-master.' When faith is come, that is when Christ is come, who is the object of faith, and hath sent forth his ser∣vants to preach the gospel, which is called the hearing of faith: 'Received ye the spirit by the works of the law,' or by the hearing of faith? That is by the hearing of the gospel preached.</P>
<P>Objection. But doth not the scripture say, 'cursed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the book of the law to do them?</P>
<P>Answer. Yes, this is the language of the law, but the language of the gospel is, 'Christ hath delivered us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us,' and Christ's ministers are to preach the gospel; perhaps some one will say, they are to preach it to the prepared subjects that are awakened by the terrors of the law, to seek salvation by Christ Jesus; they are to preach it to every creature, to tell every crea∣ture 'Christ hath delivered us from the curse of the law,
<PB N="10" REF="024860_0009_0FCD6BED82D34058"/>
being made a curse for us.' To tell it as a truth; what! to unbelievers? Yes, to unbelievers; what constitutes a man an unbeliever, but not believing the report of the gospel. He that believeth this truth is saved from the tormenting fear of the curse of the law, believing the report of the gos∣pel; while he that doth not believe this truth, remains under self condemnation or damnation, being in his own apprehension under the law, and under the curse: Man is denominated an unbeliever as not believing the truth.</P>
<P>If Christ's ministers wish to help unbelievers, let them keep close to their direction, tell the truth that is to be be∣lieved: Let them preach the 'ministry of reconciliation, that God was <HI>in</HI> Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing unto them their trespasses: That he hath made him sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God <HI>in</HI> him,' and set forth the eviden∣ces of it in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, from the dead, that if God please to accompany the evidence to their minds, they may believe.</P>
<P>Earnest repeated exhortations to believe, are lost, only tending to confuse the mind that understands not what is to be believed, but when the truth to be believed, is under∣stood, and the evidences appear undeniable, it gains credit in the mind, and what we give full credit to is believed; therefore let the gospel be preached to every creature, tell the good news even to unbelievers, for 'it is glad tidings of great joy to all people, tidings of a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.'</P>
<P>3dly. Doth not the doctrine of election, militate with the gospel's being preached to every creature? If the elect are only to obtain salvation to the rejection or repro∣bation of all others, how is it possible to preach the gospel to every creature?</P>
<P>For answer, it may be said, that this connecting of final re∣jection or reprobation with the doctrine of election, has no foundation in the scriptures. Election among men, chooses men to certain offices for the benefit of those that are not elected; and if we consider election in the sense of the scriptures, it will appear that it is designed for the benefit of others. If we turn our attention, first to Jesus Christ, it will lead our minds to Isaiah, xlii, 1, ushered in with a note of
<PB N="11" REF="024860_0010_0FCD6BF463C86680"/>
attention 'behold! behold my servant whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul delighteth,' why is Jesus Christ called God's elect, see verses, 6, 7, 'I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hard, and will keep thee and give the for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house.'</P>
<P>Question. But is it not said in the same prophesy, that he shall be a 'stone of stumbling and rock of offence to both houses of Isreal;' and Peter 'speaks of him as a stone of stumbling and rock of offence, to them that stumble at the word, being disobedient, whereunto they were appointed.' Surely, Peter doth not intend to militate with the doctrine of 'the restitution of all things, spoken of by the mouth of all God's holy Prophets since the world began,' their thus stumbling, is to fulfil the purpose of God, 'who hath con∣cluded them all in unbelief that he may have mercy on all, and thus open the blind eyes, and bring the prisoners from the prison and those that sit in darkness, out of the prison∣house.' Agreeable to the prophesy of Simeon, in his address to Mary, 'behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign that shall be spoken against.' The Apostles were chosen witnesses of the re∣surrection of Jesus Christ, and sent to the Jews; the 70 Dis∣ciples were chosen after, and sent to the Gentiles, to every place whether he himself should come. 'The Apostles were chosen to be Christ's witnesses,' chosen to this end, 'to go into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature;' Jesus Christ tells them, 'ye are the lights of the world;' lights are to guide travellers in the way; for this end, the 70 were chosen and sent forth. 'Tis expressly said of Paul, 'he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before Gentiles and Kings; and the children of Israel;' and this chosen vessel was 'sent unto the Gentiles, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of satan unto God.'</P>
<P>Which evidences that their election was for the benefit of others. Even in the xi of Romans, where the Apostle speaking of the Israelites says, 'the election hath obtained, and the rest were blinded,' and speaking of the stumbling
<PB N="12" REF="024860_0011_0FCD6BF5C68FE6B0"/>
of the blinded, saith, 'have they stumbled, that they might fall; God forbid! and shews it was to bring about the pur∣poses of God, respecting the Gentiles, which being accom∣plished, 'all Irael shall be saved as it is written;' and speak∣ing of these stumbling Jews, he saith 'as concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes, but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers sake, for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance;' shews them, 'concluded in unbelief, that God may have mercy on all.'</P>
<P>So when the Apostle, to the Ephesians speaks of their be∣ing predestinated to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of his glory, he shews the divine design herein, that in the dispensation of the fulness of time, he might gather to∣gether in one, all things in Christ, both which are in Heaven and on earth in him.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The view that has been taken of election, being for the benefit of others, and not for their destruction, might be illustrated from the old testament scriptures. When it pleased God to select Abraham from among those that served other gods, and bless him, others were not excluded, for his blessing shines most illustriously in that part of it thus expressed, in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. The choice of Moses and Aaron, the Levites the 70 Elders and the 12 princes, were all for the benefit of all Israel, and the blessing they enjoyed were conveyed to them, through the faithful attention of those various characters and officers, to their appointments, by whom they were led forward to the typical rest or land of Canaan. So are Gods elect under the gospel dispen∣sation chosen as instruments, in their places, to bring to view from the scriptures, the glad tidings of the gospel, the wing Jesus as the way to the heavenly Canaan, the rest that re∣mains to the people of God, where the leaves of the tree of life shall heal the nations, and there shall be no more curse but the throne of God and the Lamb, shall be in it, and his servants shall serve him and they shall see his face agreeable to the prayer of Jesus Christ, John, xvii, 24, 'father, I will, that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory.'</NOTE></P>
<P>It is said by the Apostle James, 'of his own will begat he us, by the word of truth that we might be a kind of first fruits of his creatures;' now the first fruits are not the whole harvest, only an earnest of it, as we see by 'the hun∣dred forty and four thousand, that are sealed in the Reve∣lations, and stand with the Lamb on the mount Zion, with the harps of God,' these first fruits are the 'elect redeem∣ed from among men, that follow the lamb, whethersoever he goeth.</P>
<P>Now it is observable both in the 7th and 14th chapters, that the sealed, the first fruits, or the elect, were not the whole of the saved; for the hundred forty-four thousand sealed, being mentioned, we read in the 9th verse, 'after this I beheld, and lo a
<PB N="13" REF="024860_0012_0FCD6BF7452686F8"/>
great multitude which no man could number, of all nations and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the Throne, and before the Lamb cloathed with white robes, and palms in their hands, and cried salvation to our God, and to the Lamb.'</P>
<P>This was so wonderful, to see this innumerable multi∣tude, beside the sealed, the elect, the first fruits, that the inquiry is, what are these and whence come they? The an∣swer is, 'these are they that come out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, therefore are they before the throne, &amp;c. These are they that came out of great tribulation: What greater tribulation can we suppose, can besal the children of men, than what arises from an apprehension of a possibility of being reprobated to eternal damnation? And being on this account, all their lifetime subject to bon∣dage through fear of death; for such to find themselves be∣fore the throne, in virtue of the blood of the Lamb, no wonder they cry with a loud voice, salvation, &amp;c. no won∣der they feel their obligations to serve him day and night in his temple, 'having him that sitteth on the throne, to dwell among them, delivered from hungering or thirsting any more, and having God to wipe away all tears from their eyes.' If we look into the 14th chapter, after the descrip∣tion of the hundred forty-four thousand, standing with the Lamb, on the mount Zion, with the harps of God, and singing the new song, we find verse 6, another angel 'fly in the midst of Heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth; even to every nation tongue, and people:' Thus I think if the doctrine of election were rightly understood, it can be no objection to preaching the gospel to every creature.</P>
<P>The Apostle Paul gives the sum of the gospel which he preached in the beginning of the 15th chapter of the first Epistle to the Corinthians, contained in the death and resurrec∣tion of Christ with the evidences of it, and speaking of the other Apostles, he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> verse 11, 'whether I or they, so we preach and so ye believed.</P>
<P>Not so we preached, but so we preach, they continue to preach the same doctrine, in their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> handed down to us, and blessed be God, we have the fulfilment of that
<PB N="14" REF="024860_0013_0FCD6BF9F381B310"/>
prophesy, (in that we have the free use of the scriptures of truth) recorded in Isaiah, xxx, 20, 'yet shall not thy teach∣ers be driven into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers, and thine ear shall hear a word behind thee, saying this is the way;' the gospel always finds us with our backs to it, pursuing another way, and points out the way into which we are to return, is not this turning, repent∣ance unto life. Is not the preaching the gospel, included in Paul's exhortation to Timothy, 'my son be strong in the grace, that is in Christ Jesus;' the same Apostle tells us what this grace is, 'ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who though he was rich for our sakes, became poor, that we through his poverty might be rich;' this is the grace made manifest in the gospel, the tidings of it are to be told to every creature; this is the grace whereby we serve God acceptably, which our Apostle exhorts to hold fast, we re∣ceiving a kingdom which cannot be moved; we read it, let us have grace, but the margin reads it agreeable to the original, 'let us hold fast the grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear,' for our God is a consuming fire; every thing in the service of God, that hath not respect to the grace that is in Christ Jesus, is wood, hay, stubble, and must be burnt up.</P>
<P>The Apostle Peter drawing to a close in his first Epistle, speaking of what he had been writing, says, 'I have written briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God, wherein ye stand;' if we look back into the Epistle, we find him writing of the grace, that is in Christ Jesus, who his ownself bear our sins in his own body on the tree, for Christ hath once suffered the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, by whose stripes ye were healed. Much hath been said about marks and evidences of true grace, in the hearts of men; but the voice behind us, re∣minds us of the true grace of God, and the evidences of it manifested in Christ Jesus, this is the grace, the Apostle exhorts the Hebrews to look dilligently least they fall from, we read it 'looking dilligently least any man fail of the grace of God,' but according to the margin, agreeable to the original, it is, least any man fall from the grace of God, to the grace of man; from the grace that is in Christ Jesus, by which alone, we are accepted to grace, in our own
<PB N="15" REF="024860_0014_0FCD6BDD2BF2CB20"/>
hearts, which cannot procure our acceptance with God: Can any one in the exercise of reverence and godly fear, approach the divine presence, in his own name, making mention of the grace, that is in his own heart, as that whereby he may serve God acceptably, it brings to mind, Isaiah, xxvii, 4, 'who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle, I would go through them, I would burn them together, or let him take hold of my strength, <HI>he</HI> may make peace with me, <HI>he</HI> shall make peace with me; peace is preached by Jesus Christ.'</P>
<P>The scriptures testify of Christ, both in the law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Plalms: The great error of many preachers, has centred in their apprehension, that the scrip∣tures testified of good men, and in proportion as this error has prevailed, we have heard of the virtue and piety of Abraham, David, the Prophets, and other pious men, whom we have been excited to follow, in hope of the divine favor, if we could come to their attainments; but the light discovers this to be a species of idolatry, putting the Creature in the place of Jesus Christ, or at least between us and him, while the gospel calls us 'to behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world.' The light discovering this error, in the place of it, their has crept in, perhaps a more undiscernable one, when preachers have been led to speak excellently of the character and finished work of Christ, they have known something else besides Jesus Christ, and him crucified, having a great part of their discourses, taken up about the excellency of believers, their experiences, attainments, devotions in their closets and families, and at public worship, and in their conduct in moral civil life, to the flattering of their pride and importance, causing them to conceive themselves the chief of saints, to the abasement of those that have not these attainments. But let it be considered whether it would not be more advan∣tageous to the believers of the gospel, as well as nearer their pattern, if they were put in mind of the various apostolic exhortations to them, and put upon inquiring how much cause they have for shame and humiliation, that these ex∣hortations have so little influence on their minds and con∣duct, which if attended to with sobriety of mind, would tend to excite them, to take rank with the chief of sinners,

and to glorify God for mercy, upon a level with the vilest. Such preachers as are above described, draw the minds of their hearers from the one object, having two to present before them; whereas the Prophet Isaiah, proposes one ob∣ject, 'the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see together. Look unto me and be saved, all the ends of the earth.' John says, 'behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world;' and Paul deter∣mines to know nothing among them, save Jesus Christ and him crucifyed. Let Peter close with his testimony of Christ, as recorded in his 1st Epistle, 2d chapter, 24 verse, 'who his ownself, bear our sins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to sin, might live to righteousness, by whose stripes ye were healed.'</P>
<P>Should the mind of any, suggest the old objection, to preaching the gospel to every creature, that was brought in the Apostle's days and is kept up, down to our day, that it endangers morality, and will excite to continue in sin, that grace may abound.</P>
<P>It may be answered, that the morality of the gospel is founded on divine love, both by Jesus Christ and his Apos∣tles; when Jesus Christ gave the golden rule as it is de∣servedly called, it was founded on the love of God, set forth in a most striking figure, 'what man is there of you, who if his son ask bread will he give him a stone?' Is there such a man <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you that are evil, prone to covetousness, anger and various other evils? Is there one among you who if his son ask bread will he give him a stone, and thus mock his hunger? What heart, among you that are evil, can do this? If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your father who is in Heaven, give good things to them that ask him? There∣fore all things whatsoever ye would, that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; you never need defraud or over-reach one another, to obtain any good you may think you want, because your heavenly father is more rea∣dy to give good things to them that ask him, than the best of you are to give bread to your children; let his love con∣strain you in all things, to do one to another, as ye would they should do to you; when Jesus bid his Disciples love their enemies, he gave the example in his love to them.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="024860_0016_0FCD6C00317CFDB8"/>When he bid them pray for them that said all manner of evil of them falsly for his name sake, he gave his exam∣ple on the cross, 'father forgive them, for they know not what they do.'</P>
<P>He saith to his Disciples, a new commandment I give unto you, 'that ye love one another, as I have loved you,' mark that, and consider, how did he love his Disciples? let one of them answer, 'herein is love, not that we loved God, but he loved us, and sent his son, the—propitiation for our sin', (he adds) 'beloved, if God so loved us, we ought to love one another,' the love of God and our neighbour, contains all morality, and we love him because he first lov∣ed us, and when we believe the love of God to our neigh∣bour, as well as to ourselves, we shall see the only founda∣tion of loving our neighbour as ourselves.</P>
<P>The morality of the gospel is founded on divine love by the Apostles; they preached the gospel to every creature, those who were gathered to the faith of the gospel, they collected into churches, and taught them to observe all things whatsoever Jesus Christ commanded; they exhorted, comforted, and charged every one of them, as a father doth his children, that they would walk worthy of God, who hath called them to his kingdom and glory. Let any one, whose mind is concerned about the preaching of the gospel to every creature, endangering morality, look over the Epistles, wrote to the churches, collected by preaching the gospel, and they will see in the former parts of these Epistles, the riches of divine grace, contained in the doc∣trine of Christ, then, the obligations the Disciples are under to adorn this doctrine, in their lives and conversations in the various places and relations that they sustain; that they which have believed in God, be careful to maintain good works, not merely to talk of them, with approbation, but be at the cost of maintaining them. If these things be soberly attended to, it will appear to any impartial inquir∣er, that the interest of morality is not endangered by preach∣ing the gospel to every creature.</P>
<P>Having inquired who Archipus was, and what was the ministry he received in the Lord; the next inquiry is, in what manner is this ministry thus received of the Lord, to be delivered to the people. The answer to this inquiry is
<PB N="18" REF="024860_0017_0FCD6C025B4406B8"/>
given by the Apostle. 'Not with wisdom of words least the cross of Christ should be made of none effect,' 1st of Co∣rinthians, xvii, to the end. 'And I brethren when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God, for I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified,' 1st of Corinthians, ii, 1 to 5, 'And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the spirit and of power, now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God, that we may know the things that are freely given us of God, which things we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.' Verses 12, 13. That is, I conceive comparing the types and prophesyes of the old testament, with their fulfilment in the antitype, as recorded in the new.</P>
<P>If it should be inquired, why were the Apostles of Christ thus cautious to shun the enticing words of man's wisdom? the two reasons the Apostle gives, may be brought as an answer; the first, the corruption of the doctrine of Christ, in these words, 'not with wisdom of words, least the cross of Christ should be made of none effect, the preaching of the cross, or of Christ crucifyed, is to the Jew a stumbling-block, and to the Greek foolishness,' now there have not been wanting those who sought by wisdom of words, to make the offence of the cross cease from the Apostles days down to our own. The false teachers in the Apostles days, laboured to reconcile the stumbling Jew to the gospel, by adding the ceremonies of the law, teaching the Gentile be∣lievers, 'except they be circumcised after the manner of Moses, they cannot be saved, making by their wisdom, the cross of Christ, of none effect,' for saith the Apostle, 'who∣soever is circumcised, he is a debtor to do the whole law, Christ is become of none effect,' seeking thus to be justified by the law, they fall from the grace of the gospel. The false teachers from the Apostles days to our own, have in like manner studied by wisdom of words, to reconcile the doctrine of Christ, to the wise Greek, who held it foolish to build the hope of salvation on Christ crucifyed, as the
<PB N="19" REF="024860_0018_0FCD6C0342B6F628"/>
only exclusive foundation; saying it is foolish for an un∣godly sinner, to look for justification by the work of Christ, unless he have repentance, faith, obedience, &amp;c. which are brought in as props to the work of Christ, as though it were not alone all sufficient; faith, as it is thus considered, is not the belief of the gospel, which reports our blessedness in Christ Jesus, but is something we must have wrought in us, or exercised by us, in order to our being interested there∣in. Repentance as it is thus considered, is not a turning from ourselves, and all creature dependence, where we have been seeking life, to Christ who is our life; but is a certain sorrow, for our open heinous, and even secret sins, to quali∣fy us for obtaining forgiveness by Christ Jesus. Obedi∣ence is likewise considered a necessary qualification for our acceptance; not as a testimony of our gratitude, that he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</P>
<P>And in this mistaken view, faith, repentance and obedi∣ance, being added to the work of Christ, are calculated to bring the doctrine to the wisdom of the Greek, who always suppose God will be propitious to the believing penitent and obedient. Every species of false religion, of what ever name or denomination, will agree here, while every true christian will agree with the Apostle, that it is<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And will break out with the Prophet Micah, who is a God like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity.</NOTE> a faith∣ful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jesus came to save sinners, of whom I am chief; but that Christ came to seek and save that which was lost, died for the ungodly, came to save sinners, even the chief, will not do to men∣tion alone, it is too weak and foolish.</P>
<P>It is true, say they, that Christ came to save that which was lost, and no sinner will miscarry, who seek him sincere∣ly, earnestly and perseveringly; but the text says, 'he came to seek and to save that which was lost,' 'tis true say they, 'Christ died for the ungodly,' and all of that discription shall be benefited thereby, that will come to him; but they will not come that they may have life; but read the text, 'my people shall be willing in the day of my power.'</P>
<P>Yes say they, but who are his people, who are given to him? Let the scriptures answer, 'the father loveth the son, and hath given all things into his hands, he hath given
<PB N="20" REF="024860_0019_0FCD6C05ACB0EB00"/>
the heathen his inheritance, and the utmost parts of the earth, his possession, and all that the father giveth, shall come.'</P>
<P>Thus we have contemplated how the wisdom of words, is employed, to endeavor to take away the stumbling block from the Jew, and the imputation of foolishness from the Greek; and that every attempt of this kind, is making the cross of Christ of none effect. The second reason, the Apostle draws from the effects on the hearers; where the doctrine of Christ is maintained, there should be a constant care to use great plainess of speech, because the poor have the gospel preached to them, and if it is preached in lan∣guage above their capacity, although it may be very good, and easy to be understood by the learned, yet if there come in one that is unlearned, how shall he say Amen, at thy giving thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou say∣est; except (says the Apostle) ye utter by the tongue, words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spok∣en, for ye shall speak unto the air; and he says I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</P>
<P>Although tongues have ceased, yet these expressions of the Apostle, may at this day be improved as a guard against language above common capacities and when such lan∣guage is familiar by use, to any of the preachers of the gos∣pel, such would do well to attend the exhortation of the Apostle, let him that speaks in an unknown tongue, pray that he may interpret; let him pray that he may be able to come to the capacity of the most unlearned of his hearers, when preaching the gospel of Christ; it seems as if this was what the Apostle meant, by saying, 'brethren be not children in understanding, in understanding be men,' as it immediately follows his saying, he had rather speak five words with his understanding that he might teach others, than ten thousand that could not be understood; for saith he, if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh, a bar∣barian unto me.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Apostle appears to aim at inculcat∣ing the delivering of the gospel with plainness of speech
<PB N="21" REF="024860_0020_0FCD6C070B649870"/>
for the above reasons, which appear weighty and worthy of attention; and says, 'seeing then we have such hope we use great plainness of speech, and not as Moses, who put a veil over his face;' and in another place neither of men sought we glory, neither of you nor of others.</P>
<P>Let gospel ministers imitate the Apostle herein, let them attend the express declaration of scripture, both of the old and new testament, that unite to publish salvation, to the end of the earth, and to the evidences of the truth of these glad tidings, of great joy to all people; that being con∣vinced of the truth of this good news, they may tell it as a truth to their hearers, even to unbelievers, in as plain, in∣telligible a manner as may be, that if it please God to ac∣company the truth with divine evidence, they may believe, and believing have life through his name.</P>
<P>Let the hearers, whose minds are at a loss about the truth of the gospel, bend their attention to the search of the scrip∣tures after the example of the Bereans, to see if these things are so.</P>
<P>And those that are satisfied of the truth, from scripture evidence, abound in thanksgiving for the manifestation of the exceeding riches of the grace appearing therein, and make it their constant study to live as the grace of God, which hath appeared, which bringeth salvation to all men, teacheth, viz. 'denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously and godly in the world, looking for the blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ, who gave himself for our sins, that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works.'</P>
<P>Let the words of the Apostle Peter close, 'if any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God, if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability, that God giveth; that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion forever,</P>
