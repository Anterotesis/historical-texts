<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Nature and End of all Civil Government is <HI>Salus Populi,</HI> and altho Civil Government in different Empires, Kingdoms, Republicks and Provinces, appear in different modes and shapes, yet the true end and design of all their Establishments are one and the same, <HI>i. e. Salus Populi.</HI></P>
<P>For which end under the English OEconomy Judges and Juries are appointed: To Hear, Try, and finally to do impartial Justice to all Persons whatsoever: and may all Judges who shall fail in their Duty through Bribery or Design meet with a just Punishment, not inferior to what befel those unhappy Wretches (once the happy Favourites of some of our greatest Kings) who are Hung up in Terrorem (as by the following Sheets will appear) that others may hear and fear and do no more so wickedly, lest an equal if not a worse Punishment be Executed upon them.</P>
<P>It's very <HI>Terrible</HI> when <HI>LION</HI>-like Judges appear upon <HI>English</HI> Benches, who neglect the <HI>Law</HI> and act generally by the Power of their own <HI>Will.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Constitution</HI> must certainly when it so happens (and such Judges Male Administration pass with Impunity) be in the utmost Danger; it's therefore thought nothing would be more acceptable to the Publick than <HI>The Triumphs of Justice over Unjust Judges;</HI> and as it is for the Information of all, so it is hop'd, it will be a Warning to all, especially Civil Officers; for which purpose the dismal Narrative of the deadly Catastrophy of so many <HI>British</HI> Judges is Reprinted.</P>

<HEAD>THE Triumphs of Justice OVER <HI>Vnjust Iudges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HI></HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">U</SEG>NDOUBTEDLY there may be, because there has been too often in the World; such a thing, such a sin, such a mischief, as <HI>Cor∣ruption of Judges,</HI> that is, when by means of Pecuniary, or other Bribes, or (which is all out as bad) Threatnings, Promises of Reward, Malice, Revenge, hopes of greater, or fears of being turned out of present Preferments, or any other ill motive; They that are appointed and Sworn to Administer <HI>equal</HI> and <HI>impartial</HI> Right and Justice, are wrap'd aside, or <HI>Bias'd</HI> to <HI>serve a Turn, or Wreck</HI> a <HI>private Grudge,</HI> or to <HI>free the Guilty,</HI> or <HI>condemn the Innocent;</HI> or to lean rather to the one side, than to the other; or wilfully to declare that to be <HI>Law,</HI> which they cannot but know is not so; or to adjudge punishments <HI>disproportionate</HI> to the Crimes that appear before them, or any the like <HI>base illegal</HI> practises.</P>
<P>How odious this Vice is, to <HI>God and Man,</HI> as being equally destructive to Religion, and Humane Society; and how severely it has been heretofore punished, by both, may appear by The Ensuing Examples.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to God, who is <HI>Capitalis Justitiarius Caeli &amp; Terrae,</HI> the Grand never∣erring Justitiary of all the World. His Sacred Word prohibits nothing more positively nor complain of any thing lowder, or with more repeated importu∣nities. <HI>Thou shalt not rest the judgment of the poor in his cause; Thou shalt take no gift, for a gift blindeth the eye of the wise, and perverteth the words of the Righteous,</HI> Exod. 23.6. and 8. ver. <HI>Thou shalt not rest judgment; thou shalt not re∣spect persons, neither take a gift,</HI> &amp;c. Deut. 16.19. Woe <HI>unto them that justifie the wicked for reward, and taketh away the righteousness of the righteous from him,</HI> Isa. 5.23. <HI>A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosome</HI> ('tis done you see <HI>slyly,</HI> and in the <HI>dark) to pervert the ways of judgment,</HI> Prov. 17.23 <HI>Woe unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
<PB N="2" REF="040005_0006_1015BDEA14422458"/>
who turn judgment into wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</HI> Amos 5.7 <HI>The good man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright amongst men; They all lye in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother as with a net, that they may do evil with both hands earnestly. The Prince asketh, and the Judge gapeth for a reward; and the great man uttereth his mischievous de∣sire, so they wrap it up: the best of them is as a briar, the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedg,</HI> &amp;c. Mic. 7.2, 3, &amp; 4 ver. with many of the like Texts.</P>
<P N="2">2. As corrupt Judges are thus obnoxious to the <HI>Curse of God,</HI> so hath his Divine Providence not seldome Executed it upon them even in this world by the hands of <HI>men.</HI> Nor indeed is there any thing that can render <HI>Kings</HI> (Gods Vicegerents) more <HI>Glorious,</HI> or better establish any <HI>state,</HI> than to keep the Current of <HI>Justice</HI> clear and unfullied; and exemplarily to punish their Subordinate <HI>Ministers,</HI> and especially <HI>Judges</HI> that shall presume to <HI>impoison</HI> that Sacred <HI>Fountain.</HI></P>
<P>Several Heathen Princes are Renowned for this wholesom severity. 'Tis said of <HI>Alexander Severus</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor, that he had such an aversion and abhorrence of unjust Judges, that at the very sight of them he would vomit <HI>Choler,</HI> and was ready with his fingers to <HI>pluck out their eyes. Theatrum Historicum, f.</HI> 546.</P>
<P>The Mighty Monarch <HI>Cambyses,</HI> King of <HI>Persia,</HI> finding that one <HI>Sisamnes</HI> his <HI>Chief Justice (Proeses</HI> our Author calls him in <HI>Latin</HI>) had receiv'd a <HI>Bribe,</HI> and for the same pronounced an unjust Sentence, forthwith caused him to be Executed, and curiously flead, and with his skin cover'd the <HI>Common Seat</HI> of Justice, and Constituted <HI>Otanes</HI> (the said <HI>Sisamnes</HI>'s own Son) Judge in his Room; That so beholding daily those <HI>Reliques</HI> of his justly-punisht Father; It might serve as a <HI>Memento</HI> to him to act more uprightly. <HI>Chronicon Carionis. l.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 19.</P>
<P>But not to search so far off, our own Nation affords us (perhaps) the most notable and numerous Examples of <HI>Royal Justice</HI> in this kind of any in the world. For we find it Recorded in that Antient Law-Book, Entituled, The <HI>Mirrour</HI> of <HI>Justices</HI> (most of which is said to be Compiled before the <HI>Conquest,</HI> and Augmented by the Learned <HI>Andrew Horn</HI> in the Reign of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the 1st. and which is often Cited by the Famous Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> and to this day continues in good Repute amongst Lawyers) That King <HI>Alfred,</HI> a Renowned <HI>Saxon</HI> Prince, who Governed this Realm about the Year of our Lord 900. did in one years space bring to Condign punishment, <HI>no fewer than four and forty of his Justices,</HI> (so the Law Terms those we call Judges; and this was long before, either Justices of the Peace Establisht, or the Courts fixed at <HI>Westmin∣ster:</HI> But Justice was in those days Administred in the Country, in Neigh∣bouring Courts, which yet (as appears by the nature of the offences alledged against them) had <HI>jus vitae &amp; necis, power of life and death,</HI> and so may pro∣perly be called Judges) whose Names and particular Crimes here follow in the words of that worthy Author, <HI>p.</HI> 296, of the <HI>French,</HI> and <HI>p.</HI> 239 of the <HI>English</HI> Edition.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="040005_0007_1015BE55E37A0800"/>It is an abuse that Justices and their Officers who kill People by <HI>false judg∣ment,</HI> be not destroyed, which King <HI>Alfred</HI> caused to be done, who caused <HI>Forty four Justices</HI> in one year, to be hanged as <HI>Murderers</HI> for their <HI>false judgments.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. He hanged <HI>Darling</HI> because he judged <HI>Sidulf</HI> to death, for the retreat of <HI>Edulf</HI> his Son, who afterwards acquitted him of the Fact.</P>
<P N="2">2. He hanged <HI>Segnar,</HI> who judged <HI>Ulf</HI> to death after sufficient <HI>acquittal.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. He hanged <HI>Cadwine,</HI> because that he judged <HI>Hachwy</HI> to death without the <HI>Consent of all the Jurors;</HI> for whereas he had put himself upon a jury of <HI>Twelve-men;</HI> and because that three would have saved him against the <HI>Nine: Cadwine</HI> removed the <HI>three</HI> and put <HI>others</HI> upon the jury, upon whom <HI>Hachwy</HI> put not himself.</P>
<P N="4">4. He hanged <HI>Cole,</HI> because he judged <HI>Ive</HI> to death when he was a <HI>Mad-man.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. He hanged <HI>Malme,</HI> because he judged <HI>Prat</HI> to death upon a false sug∣gestion that he committed the felony.</P>
<P N="6">6. He hanged <HI>Athulf,</HI> because he caused <HI>Copping</HI> to be hang'd before the Age of one and twenty years. [It was against Law then, but now <HI>nequitia supplet Aetatem.</HI>]</P>
<P N="7">7. He hanged <HI>Markes,</HI> because he judged <HI>During</HI> to death by twelve men that were not <HI>sworn.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. He hanged <HI>Ostline,</HI> because he judged <HI>Seaman</HI> to death by a false War∣rant, grounded upon false suggestion, which supposed <HI>Seaman</HI> to be a Person in the warrant, which he was not.</P>
<P N="9">9. He hanged <HI>Billing,</HI> because he judged <HI>Leston</HI> to death by fraud: In this manner, he said to the People, <HI>sit</HI> all ye here but he who killed the man, and because that <HI>Leston</HI> did not sit with the other, he commanded him to be hang∣ed, and said that he did assist, where he knew he did not assist to kill the Party.</P>
<P N="10">10. He hanged <HI>Seasoul,</HI> because he judged <HI>Ording</HI> to death, as not answering.</P>
<P N="11">11. He hanged <HI>Thurston,</HI> because he judged <HI>Thurgner</HI> to death by a Verdict of Inquest, taken <HI>ex officio,</HI> without <HI>Issue</HI> joyned.</P>
<P N="12">12. He hanged <HI>Athelston,</HI> because he judged <HI>Herbert</HI> to death for an offence not mortal.</P>
<P N="13">13 He hanged <HI>Rambold,</HI> because he judged <HI>Leschild</HI> in a Case not notorious, without <HI>Appeal,</HI> and without <HI>Indictment.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14 He hanged <HI>Rolf,</HI> because he judged <HI>Dunston</HI> to dye for an escape out of prison.</P>
<P N="15">15. He hanged <HI>Frebern,</HI> because he judged <HI>Harpin</HI> to dye, whereas the Jury were in <HI>doubt of their verdict,</HI> for in doubtful cases one ought rather to save than condemn.</P>
<P N="16">16. He hanged <HI>Seabright,</HI> who judged <HI>Athebrus</HI> to death, because he had discharg'd one that had given a false judgment in a Case Capital.</P>
<P N="17">17. He hanged <HI>Hale,</HI> because he saved <HI>Tristrain</HI> the Sheriff from death, who took to the Kings use from another goods against his will, for as much as any such taking from another against his will, and <HI>Robbery</HI> hath no difference.</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="4" REF="040005_0008_1015BEBD9EA4C5B8"/>18. He hanged <HI>Arnold,</HI> because he saved <HI>Bailifs,</HI> who robbed the people by colour of <HI>Distresses;</HI> some by selling <HI>Distresses,</HI> such, and others by <HI>extortion of</HI> Fines; because between such tortious Acts &amp; Robbery there was no difference.</P>
<P N="19">19. He hanged <HI>Erkinwald,</HI> because he hanged <HI>Frankling,</HI> for nought else, but because he taught to him who vanquished him by <HI>Battle</HI>-mortal to say the word <HI>Cravant.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. He hanged <HI>Bermond,</HI> because he caused <HI>Garbot</HI> to be beheaded by his judgment in <HI>England,</HI> for that, for which he was <HI>outlaw'd</HI> in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. He hanged <HI>Alkman,</HI> because he saved <HI>Cateman</HI> by colour of <HI>Disseisin,</HI> who was Attaited of <HI>Burglary.</HI></P>
<P N="22">22. He hanged <HI>Saxmond,</HI> because he hanged <HI>Barold</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> where the King's Writ runneth for a fact which he did in the same Land, where the Kings Writ did not run.</P>
<P N="23">23. He hanged <HI>Alflet,</HI> because he judged a <HI>Clerk</HI> to death over whom he had no Cognizance.</P>
<P N="24">24. He hanged <HI>Piron,</HI> because he judged <HI>Huntiny</HI> to death; because he gave judgment in Appeal before the <HI>forty days</HI> pendant; the Appeal by a Writ of false judgment before the King.</P>
<P N="25">25. He hanged <HI>Delani,</HI> because he caused <HI>Eldons</HI> to be hanged, who kill'd a man by misfortune.</P>
<P N="26">26. He hanged <HI>Oswin,</HI> because he judged <HI>Fulcher</HI> to death out of Court.</P>
<P N="27">27. He hanged <HI>Mucdin,</HI> because he hanged <HI>Helgrave</HI> by warrant of Indict∣ment not special.</P>
<P N="28">28. He hanged <HI>Horn,</HI> because he hanged <HI>Simin</HI> at days forbidden.</P>
<P N="29">29. He hanged <HI>Wolmer,</HI> because he judged <HI>Grant</HI> to death by colour of a Larceny, of a thing which he had received by Title of Bailment.</P>
<P N="30">30 He hanged <HI>Therberne</HI> because he Judged <HI>Osgot</HI> to death for a Fact where∣of he was <HI>Acquitted before</HI> against the same Plantiff; which Acquaintance he tendred to averr by <HI>Oath,</HI> and because he would not aver it by <HI>Record, Therberne</HI> would not allow of the Acquittal which he tendred him.</P>
<P N="31">31. He hanged <HI>Wolston</HI> because he adjudged <HI>Howbert</HI> to death at the suit of the King, for a fact which <HI>Howbert</HI> confest, and of which the King gave him <HI>his Pardon,</HI> but he had no Charter thereof; nevertheless he vouched the King to <HI>Warrant</HI> it, and further tendred to averr it by Enrollment of the Chancery.</P>
<P N="32">32. He hanged <HI>Oskitell</HI> because he Judged <HI>Cutlinge</HI> to death by the Record of the <HI>Coroner,</HI> where by Replication allowable, the Plea did not hold; And the Case was such, <HI>Cutling</HI> was taken and Tortured so much, as he confessed he had Mortally offended, only to be quitted of the pain; and <HI>Oskitell</HI> adjudged him to death upon such his Confession which he had made to the Coroner, without trial of <HI>the truth</HI> of the Torture or the <HI>Fact.</HI> And further the said King caused the <HI>Coroners</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> Accessories to be apprehended who hang∣ed the people, and all those that might have hindred the false Judgment, and did not hinder the same in all cases: For he hanged <HI>all the Judges</HI> who had falsely <HI>saved any man</HI> guilty of Death; or hath falsely hanged any man <HI>against Law,</HI> or any reasonable <HI>Exception.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="040005_0009_1015BEBF4EC9FAF0"/>He hanged the Suitors of <HI>Calevot,</HI> because they had adjudged a man to death in a case <HI>not notorious,</HI> although he were guilty thereof; for no man can Judge within the Realm but the King, or his Commissaries, except those Lords in whose Lordships the Kings Writ doth not run.</P>
<P>He hanged the <HI>Suitors</HI> of <HI>Dorcester,</HI> because they Judged a man to death by Jurors in their Liberty for a Felony done out of it, and whereof they had not the <HI>Conusance</HI> by reason of <HI>forraignty.</HI></P>
<P>He hanged the <HI>Suitors</HI> of <HI>Cirencester,</HI> because they kept a man so long in Prison, that he dyed in Prison, who would have acquitted himself by <HI>Forraigners</HI> that he offended not Feloniously.</P>
<P>['Tis supposed these Suitors of each place were Four in Number, which compleats the number of Forty Four Hanged in all.]</P>
<P>In his time also the <HI>Suitors</HI> of <HI>Doncaster</HI> lost their Jurisdiction, besides other Punishments, because they held Pleas forbidden by the Customs of the Realm to Ordinary Judges and Suitors to hold.</P>
<P>In this time <HI>Colgrin</HI> lost his Franchise of <HI>Enfangthief,</HI> because he would not send a Thief to the common Goal of the County, who was taken within his <HI>Liberty,</HI> and not Bailable.</P>
<P>In this time <HI>Buttolph</HI> lost his view of <HI>Frank-pledges</HI> because he charged the Jurors with <HI>other Articles</HI> than those which belonged to the <HI>View,</HI> and <HI>Amerced</HI> people in personal Actions where one was not to be amerced by a pecuniary Punishment: And accordingly he caused punishments of Death to Criminal Judges for wrongful mortal Judgments, and so he did proportionably for wrong∣ful Judgments of a lesser nature: As Imprisonment for wrongful Imprison∣ments, and like for like with the other Punishments; for he delivered <HI>Thelweld</HI> to Prison, because he Judged men to Prison for Offences where they ought not to be Imprisoned.</P>
<P>He Judged <HI>Lithing</HI> to Prison because he imprisoned <HI>Herbote</HI> for the Offence of his <HI>Wife.</HI></P>
<P>He Judged <HI>Rutwood</HI> to Prison because he Imprisoned <HI>Old</HI> for the King's <HI>Debt.</HI></P>
<P>[Note, In those days people were not to be Imprisoned for Debt, but only their Goods distrain'd.]</P>
<P>On the other side, he cut off the hand of <HI>Haulf,</HI> because he saved <HI>Armorks</HI> Hand, who was Attainted before him, that he had Feloniously wounded <HI>Rich∣bold.</HI></P>
<P>He Judged <HI>Edulfe</HI> to be wounded, because he Judged not <HI>Arnold</HI> to be wounded, who had Feloniously wounded <HI>Aldens.</HI></P>
<P>In lesser Judgments he did not meddle with the Judgments; but Disinhe∣rited the Justices, and Removed them according to the Points of those Statutes, where he could understand that they had Transgressed their Jurisdiction, or the Bounds of their Delegacy or Commission; or had concealed Fines or Amer∣ciaments or ought that belonged to the King, or had Released or <HI>Increased any Punishment contrary to Law,</HI> or procured Pleadings without Warrant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>In the year 1290, being (faith <HI>Walsingham,</HI> p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4) the 17th year of <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. <HI>Justitiarios sere omnes de falfitate deprehensos a suo Officio deposuit ipsos juxta morita puniens gravi Mulcta. He finding almost all his Judges guilty of Corrup∣tion, put them out of their places, and Punisht them according to their Demerits with heavy Fines.</HI> Which the Lord <HI>Cook</HI> in the Second part of his <HI>Institutes, Fol.</HI> 508. likewise takes notice of, and tells us, That this was done <HI>by a Par∣liament</HI> held after the Feast of St. <HI>Hillary,</HI> and only two Judges scap'd scot-free.

Baron of the <HI>Exchequer</HI> (who it seems had been a notable <HI>Bribe-fingerer) four and thirty</HI> Thousand Marks, [<HI>A prodigious Sum almost</HI> 400 <HI>years ago!</HI>] And Sir <HI>Thomas Wayland</HI> Chief Justice of the <HI>Common-Pleas</HI> being found the greatest Offender of all, was Attainted of Felony for taking of <HI>Bribes,</HI> and his Lands and Goods Forfeited: as appears in the <HI>Pleas of Parliament,</HI> 18. <HI>Edw.</HI> 1. And he was also Banisht the Kingdom, as unworthy to live in that State against which he had so much Offended.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>William Thorp</HI> Chief Justice of the <HI>Kings-Bench</HI> in K. <HI>Edw,</HI> the Third's time, having of five several Persons received five several Bribes, which in all amounted to 100 <HI>l.</HI> was for this alone adjudged to be Hang'd, and all his Goods and Lands Forfeited.</P>
<P>The reason of the Judgment is entred in the Roll in these words — <HI>Quia praedictus Willielmus Thorpe qui Sacramentum Domini Regis erga populum suum habuit ad Custodiendum, fregit malitiose, false &amp; Rebelliter quantum in ipso fuit. Because that as much as in him lay, he had broken the Kings Oath made to the People, which the King had Intrusted him withal.</HI></P>
<P>And so much did the then Collective Wisdom of the Nation respect Judges herein, that 'tis expresly entred, that this Judgment should not be drawn into example against any other Officers who should break their Oaths, but only a∣gainst those, <HI>Qui predictum Sacramentum secerunt et fregerunt, et habent Leges Angliae ad Custodiendum.</HI> That is, only to the Judges that violate their Oaths, having the Laws of <HI>England</HI> Entrusted unto them.</P>
<P>This <HI>Judgment</HI> was given 24. <HI>Edw.</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI> The next year in the Parliament 25 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. <HI>Numero</HI> 10. it was debated in Parliament, Whether this Judgment was Legal, and <HI>Nullo Contradicente,</HI> unanimously <HI>it was declared to be just and according to the Law,</HI> and that the same Judgment may be given in time to come upon the like occasion. Which Case, I humbly conceive, resolves the Case in Law <HI>Point Blank</HI> thus: <HI>That it is death for any Judge wittingly to break his Oath in any part of it.</HI> This Oath of <HI>Thorp</HI> is entred in the <HI>Roll,</HI> and is the same <HI>verbatim,</HI> with the Judges Oath in 18 <HI>Edw.</HI> 3. The same too (as I humbly conceive) which our Judges now a days take, and is herein after∣wards punctually recited.</P>
<P>The Oaths of our Judges of <HI>England,</HI> as they bind them to the <HI>due Admini∣stration of Justice to the Subject, according to the Laws,</HI> (which are every <HI>Free-mans</HI> Birth-Right) so also, as they be of the Kings Council, they are by such their Oaths oblig'd, <HI>lawfully to counsel him,</HI> that is, whenever their opinions are demanded, they are sworn and bound to deliver them <HI>according to the Law.</HI> — Let us see how our <HI>Ancestors</HI> resented these matters.</P>
<P>In a Parliament held in the 11<HI>th</HI> year of <HI>Richard</HI> the 2. there was Judgment of <HI>High-Treason</HI> given against 18 several Persons, and all, save one of them, of Eminent Rank; Three Privy Counsellors, <HI>viz</HI> The <HI>Arch Bishop of York,</HI> The <HI>Duke of Ireland,</HI> and <HI>Earl of Suffolk,</HI> the <HI>Bishop of Exeter,</HI> the <HI>Kings Confessor, Five Knights,</HI> of whom some had been Servants to <HI>Edw.</HI> the 3. and all, but one, Servants to the then King, and some of them of Noble Descent; but that
<PB N="8" REF="040005_0012_1015BEC966BD7718"/>
which I more particularly observe, there were amongst them Six <HI>Judges,</HI> and <HI>Locton</HI> the Kings <HI>Serjeant at Law▪ Blake</HI> of the Kings <HI>Council at Law,</HI> and <HI>Usk</HI> the under <HI>Sheriff</HI> of <HI>Middlesex.</HI></P>
<P>Of these 18, 8 were Executed, that is, Sir <HI>Robert Tresilian,</HI> the <HI>Lord Chief Justice</HI> was drawn from the <HI>Tower,</HI> through the midst of <HI>London,</HI> to <HI>Tyburn,</HI> and there <HI>Hanged;</HI> so likewise were <HI>U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k</HI> and <HI>Blake,</HI> and <HI>Sir John Salisbury;</HI> but the other four <HI>Knights</HI> had the Favour to be <HI>Beheaded.</HI></P>
<P>Three, that is, the Archbishop of <HI>York,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> died miserable Fugitives in foreign Parts.</P>
<P>The other seven (whereof five were <HI>Judges</HI>) with much ado got a Pardon as to Life, but were banished, and their Lands and Goods all forfeited; and it was made Felony for any to procure their Recalling home, and themselves forth∣with to be executed as Traytors, if at any time they should presume to return.</P>
<P>And of these eighteen Persons, all save three were impeached by the <HI>Commons.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Offences</HI> which procured these <HI>Exemplary Punishments,</HI> were briefly these:</P>
<P>King <HI>Richard</HI> the II. being an unthinking dissolute Prince, by the ill counsel of some near his Person, there had during his minority happened divers mis∣carriages in the Government: To redress which, in a Parliament holden in the tenth year of his Reign, and the twentieth of his Age, a Commission was awarded to <HI>Twelve Peers,</HI> and others of greatest Wisdom and Ability, impower∣ing them to inspect the past management of the <HI>Houshold,</HI> the <HI>Revenue,</HI> the <HI>Courts of Justice,</HI> and in a word, all things that did concern the Good of the <HI>Realm;</HI> with full power finally to determine, and put all things in execution, so as might most tend to the <HI>Honour</HI> of the <HI>King, Relief</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> and <HI>Safety</HI> of the <HI>Land;</HI> which <HI>Commission</HI> was to endure only one year.</P>
<P>Now come five of the Persons above named, <HI>viz</HI> the Arch-bishop, the Duke, the Earl of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> the Chief <HI>Justice,</HI> and <HI>Brembre,</HI> who seeing themselves like to be called to Account for their pernicious Counsels and Irregularities, and to be brought to deserved shame and punishment; to avoid the same, and continue their Villanies for the future, they insinuated to the King, <HI>That this Commission intrenched upon the Royal Power, and was derogatory to the Crown, that the procu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers thereof had extorted His Royal Assent thereunto in Parliament;</HI> and <HI>that this was Treason</HI>▪ for so the Chief <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Blake</HI> the Kings Council, who was advised withal in the <HI>Writ,</HI> declared it to be; whereupon <HI>Blake</HI> was commanded to prepare an Indictment of Treason against all the said Com∣missioners, and against such others as had been most active in procuring that Authority: Accordingly he draws the Indictment which stands entred in the Roll, and is to this effect, <HI>That the said Commissioners, &amp;c. had Traiterously conspired among themselves to make this Commission by Authority of Parliament against the Royalty of the King, to his disherison, and in derogation of the Crown, and that they forced the Kings Consent, and confederated themselves to maintain one another in so doing.</HI></P>
<P>It was designed that they should be tryed upon this Indictment in <HI>Middlesex</HI> or <HI>London,</HI> and therefore (some of the parties to be prosecuted not being Peers)
<PB N="9" REF="040005_0013_1015BECE4D8C79B0"/>
<HI>Usk</HI> the Under-Sheriff of <HI>Middlesex</HI> was acquainted with the business, (who was to return a Pack'd Jury (you see that's a very old <HI>Game</HI>) that might be sure to do the business, which he performing accordingly, was therefore <HI>hang'd.</HI></P>
<P>But further, the five grand <HI>Favourites,</HI> that the King might the more confide in their Counsels, (for so are the words of the <HI>Record</HI>) and that under colour of Law, they might cover their malice from the King and the Kingdom, before the Trials were to be brought on, advise the King to demand the Opinion of some of the <HI>Judges,</HI> that is, of the two <HI>Chief Justices</HI> and <HI>Chief Baron,</HI> and the <HI>Judges</HI> of the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> six in all in number, and of <HI>Locton</HI> the <HI>Kings Ser∣jeant; Blake,</HI> of the <HI>Kings Council at Law,</HI> was commanded to draw up those <HI>Questions,</HI> who did it accordingly, and for <HI>drawing</HI> the same, and the before-mentioned Indictment, he was himself <HI>Drawn</HI> and <HI>Hanged.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Questions</HI> being prepared in Writing, the <HI>Judges</HI> were sent for to <HI>Not∣tingham Castle,</HI> where in the Kings own Presence, they were commanded upon their <HI>Allegiance</HI> to deliver their Opinions,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Whether the Commission was derogatory to the Rights of the Crown</HI>? They answered, <HI>It was.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Whether the perswading and urging the King to consent thereunto in Par∣liament, was Treason</HI>? They answered, <HI>That it was.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Here were other <HI>Questions</HI> ask'd, but these were the Main, and <HI>those for which they were condemned,</HI> as appears by the Replication of the <HI>Commons</HI> to the <HI>Judges Answer,</HI> and by the Words of the <HI>Judgment — That they the said</HI> Judges <HI>knew that this Commission was awarded in Parliament, &amp;c that it was for the Publick Good; That they knew of the Traiterous Intent to destroy the Procurers of this Commission; That they knew the Law, and that it was not Treason, and had de∣livered such Opinions thereby, under colour of Law, to cover their Treasonable Intent,</HI> and therefore Judgment of <HI>High Treason</HI> was given against them, and against <HI>Locton</HI> the Kings <HI>Serjeant,</HI> who had Subscribed these False Opinions with the <HI>Judges.</HI> And though there be other Articles against the <HI>Rest,</HI> yet this alone is adjudged <HI>Treason,</HI> in the several <HI>Judgments</HI> against every one of the Eighteen: And 'tis observable, <HI>That in all these Judgments, they are adjudged Traitors as well against the Person of the King, as against the Common-wealth</HI></P>
<P>And it is there declared upon great Advice taken, <HI>That in Treasons which concern the King and Kingdom, they are not bound to proceed according to the Rules of the Common Law, but according to the Course of Parliaments, so as may be for the Common Good.</HI> Nor were these <HI>Judgments</HI> huddled up in haste, but given upon long and mature Deliberation, <HI>the Work of a Whole Parliament.</HI> And it is declared in the <HI>Roll, That they spent long time, and took great pains in ex∣amining the Evidence,</HI> the better thereby to satisfy their own Consciences and the World. Their Proceedings against the five Plotters were begun the 14 of <HI>Novemb.</HI> and the <HI>Judgments</HI> were not given till the 15 of <HI>Feb.</HI> following, which is a <HI>Quarter</HI> of a <HI>Year.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis also to be observed, <HI>That several of these Judges were very unwilling to give their</HI> Corrupt Opinions, <HI>but were</HI> menaced <HI>and</HI> violently <HI>drawn thereunto by
<PB N="10" REF="040005_0014_1015BED012203A70"/>
the Duke of</HI> Ireland <HI>and others.</HI> And at their <HI>Trials,</HI> they severally Alledged, <HI>That in part</HI> Violence <HI>had been offered to their Persons, because they had deferred the delivery of their Opinions.</HI> But as <HI>Fear</HI> or <HI>Cowardice</HI> is no <HI>Plea</HI> for deliver∣ing up of the <HI>Forts</HI> or <HI>Bulwarks</HI> of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> so neither is it for <HI>basely be∣traying our Rights and Liberties.</HI> These Allegations of being <HI>threatned from their Duty,</HI> could not excuse them from the <HI>Rope:</HI> but how much more then do they deserve it who shall presume to do as bad things or <HI>worse,</HI> without any <HI>Menaces</HI> at all, but wilfully and presumptuously, purely out of their own base inclinations?</P>
<P>But <HI>Tresilian</HI> was not the only Judge which our <HI>English History,</HI> even since the Conquest, mentions to have been executed for irregular Practices: For in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, a <HI>Wise</HI> but <HI>Avaritious</HI> Prince, there were two Gentlemen of the Long Robe, that for private Interest, and to serve the Kings present <HI>Turn,</HI> were ready to dispense with their <HI>Oaths,</HI> and the known Fundamental Laws. But as they liv'd <HI>hated</HI> during his time, so they died <HI>un∣lamented</HI> under his Successor, being given up a necessary <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to <HI>Publick Justice.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Names</HI> were Sir <HI>Richard Empson</HI> Knight, and <HI>Edmund Dudley,</HI> both (saith Sir <HI>Richard Baker,</HI> fol. 247) <HI>Lawyers,</HI> and both of them <HI>Barons</HI> of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> and <HI>Justices</HI> of the <HI>Peace</HI> throughout <HI>England: Dudley</HI> of a good Family, but <HI>Empson</HI> the Son of a <HI>Sieve-maker:</HI> So true is that Remark of the <HI>Poet;</HI>
<Q>Mendico asperius nihil est cum surgit ad Altum.</Q></P>
<P>There is no Person in the World more <HI>Haughty,</HI> or an <HI>Apter Tool</HI> for Op∣pression, than a <HI>Beggars Bratt</HI> or some base <HI>Mechanick, Butcherly Off-spring,</HI> when undeservedly flush'd with Preferment.</P>
<P>The <HI>King</HI> made odd Use of these Two Instruments. <HI>They turn'd</HI> (says <HI>Baker) Law into Rapine.</HI> And most certain it is, that many ill Things they did: But the better to colour their vile Practices, a Statute was Provided, to Justify their Invasions on the Liberties and Properties of their <HI>Fellow Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>We will give you an Account of this Matter, in the very Words of that Great <HI>Oracle of our Law,</HI> Sir <HI>Edward Cook.</HI> But first, hear how Sir <HI>Richard Baker,</HI> in his <HI>Chronocle, fol.</HI> 24<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. represents them:</P>
<P><Q>Their Manner was (<HI>saith he</HI>) to cause divers Subjects to be Indicted of Crimes, and then presently to Commit them, and not Produce them to their Answer, but suffer them to Languish long in Prison; and by sundry Artificial Devices and Terror, extort from them great <HI>Fines,</HI> which they termed <HI>Com∣positions</HI> and <HI>Mitigations▪</HI> Neither did they (towards the End) observe so much as the Half Face of <HI>Justice,</HI> in Proceeding by Indictment; but sent forth their Precepts to Attach Men, and Convent them before Themselves, and some Others, at their private Houses; and there shuffle up a Summary Proceeding by Examination, WITHOUT TRYAL BY JURY; assuming to them∣selves to deal both in <HI>Pleas of the Crown,</HI> and <HI>Controversies Civil.</HI> Then did they also use to Enthral, and Charge the Subjects Land with Tenures
<PB N="11" REF="040005_0015_1015BED2A2194F20"/>
<HI>in Capite,</HI> by finding False Offices, refusing upon divers Pretexts &amp; Delays, to admit Men to Traverse those False Offices. Nay, contrary to all Law and Colour, they maintain'd, That the <HI>King</HI> ought to have the Half of Mens Lands and Rents, during the Space of full Two Years, for a Pain, in case of <HI>Outlawry.</HI> They would likewise <HI>Ruffle</HI> with <HI>Jurors,</HI> and enforce them to Find, as they would direct: And if they did not, then Convent, Imprison, and Fine them. These, and many other Courses they had, of Preying upon the People, and had ever a <HI>Rabble</HI> of <HI>Promoters,</HI> and <HI>Leading Jurors</HI> at their Command, so as they could have <HI>any Thing</HI> found, either for <HI>Fact,</HI> or <HI>Valuation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus far the <HI>Historian.</HI> Now, take the Relation of the <HI>Reverend Judge</HI> COOK, in his ever-valuable Works, Commenting in the <HI>Second Part</HI> of his <HI>Institutes</HI> on that <HI>GOLDEN Nine</HI> and <HI>Twentieth Chapter</HI> of MAGNA CHARTA; which being of <HI>Inestimable Value,</HI> I take it for granted, no True <HI>English-Man</HI> will any more grudge the <HI>Reading,</HI> than I do the <HI>Recital</HI> of it; and I wish it might every <HI>Market Day,</HI> be repeated with a <HI>Speaking Trumpet,</HI> in every Town &amp; Cor∣poration of this Kingdom. The Words run thus:
<Q>Nullus Liber Homo, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>No Free Man shall be Taken, or Imprisoned, or Disseised of his Free-Te∣nement or Liberties, or Free-Customs; or be Out-law'd, or Exil'd, or in any manner Destroy'd: Nor will we pass upon him, nor send any <HI>(to pass)</HI> upon him: But by the Lawful Judgment of his PEERS, or by the Law of the Land. We will <HI>Sell</HI> to none, we will <HI>Deny</HI> to none, nor to any <HI>delay Justice</HI> or <HI>Right.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Discoursing, I say, upon this most Comprehensive Text, the <HI>Corner-Stone</HI> of all our <HI>English</HI> Freedoms, my Lord <HI>Cook,</HI> 2 <HI>Instit. fol.</HI> 51. thus expresses himself:</P>
<P><HI>Against this Antient and Fundamental Law, and in the Face thereof, I find an Act of Parliament made</HI> 11 H 7. Cap. 3. <HI>That as well Justices of Assize, as Justices of the Peace (without any Finding, or Presentment by the Verdict of Twelve Men) upon a bare Information for the King, before them made, should have full Power and Authority, by their Discretions, to Hear and Determine all Offences,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fourth Part, Instit. fol.</HI> 39. he gives a further Account of, and Recites this Act thus:</P>
<P><Q>There was an Act of Parliament made in the 11 <HI>H.</HI> 7. which had a <HI>Fair, Flattering</HI> Preamble, pretending to avoid divers Mischiefs, which were, 1. The High Displeasure of Almighty <HI>God.</HI> 2. The great Let of the Common-Law. And, 3. The great Let of the Wealth of this Land. And the Purview of that Act tended in the Execution contrary, <HI>Ex Diametro,</HI> viz. to the Dis∣pleasure of Almighty <HI>God,</HI> The great Let, nay, the utter Subversion of the Common-Law, and, The great Let of the Wealth of this Land; Which Act followeth in these Words;</Q></P>

<HI>THE King our Sovereign Lord, calling to his Remembrance, That many good Statutes, and Ordinances be made for the Punishment of Riots, and unlawful Assemblies, Reteinders in giving, and receiving of Liveries, Signs, and Tokens un∣lawfully, Extortions, Maintenances, Imbracery, Excessive taking of Wages, contrary to the Statute of Labourers and Artificers, the Use unlawful Games, Inordinate Apparel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the displeasure of Almighty God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> notwithstanding that gene∣rally, by the Justices of the Peace, in every Shire within this Realm, in the open Sessions, it is given in Charge to inquire of many Offences committed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and divers Inquests thereupon straightly Sworn, and Charged before the said Justices to inquire of the Premises, and therein to present the Troth, which they letted to be found by Imbracery, Maintenance, Corruption, and Favour; by occasion whereof, the said Statutes be not, nor cannot be put in due Execution: For Reformation whereof, forsomuch that before this time the said Offences, Extortions, Contempts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> might not, nor as yet may be conveniently Punished by the due Order of Law, except it were first found, and presented by the Verdict of <HI>Twelve</HI> Men thereto duly Sworn, who for the Causes before Recited, will not find, nor present the Truth; where∣fore be it by the Advice, and Assent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present <HI>Parliament</HI> Assembled, and by Authority of the same Enacted, Ordained, and Established; That from henceforth, as well the Justices of Assize, as the Justices of the Peace, in every County of the said Realm, upon Information</HI> [Note, it was to be without any Presentment, or Indictment found by any Grand or Petty Jury] <HI>for the King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shall have full Power, and Au∣thority by their <HI>Discretion</HI> to hear, and determine all Offences,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Here you see Matters were left to be determined by Judges &amp; Justices WITH∣OUT JURIES, in a Summary, Chancery-Method, only according forsooth! to their Discretion: Yet still there was a <HI>Proviso,</HI>
<HI>THat no such Information should extend to Treason, Murder or Felony; nor to any other Offence, for which any Person should lose Life or Member: Nor to lose by, or upon the same Information, any Lands, Tenements, Goods, or Chattels, to the Party making the same Information.</HI></P>
<P>[<HI>Which deserves Particular Notice:</HI>] Yet observe, how the same <HI>Reverend Lord</HI> COOK, in the Place before cited, descants on this Act.</P>
<P><HI>By Pretext <HI>(saith he)</HI> of this Law, <HI>Empson</HI> and <HI>Dudley</HI> did commit upon the Subject unsufferable Pressures and Oppressions; and therefore, this Statute was Justly, soon after the Decease of <HI>Henry the Seventh,</HI> Repeal'd by an Act of Par∣liament, <HI>1 H. 8. Cap 8.</HI> A good Caveat to Parliaments, to leave all Causes to be measured by that <HI>Golden,</HI> and Strait-Mete-Wand of the <HI>Law,</HI> and not to the incer∣tain and crooked Cord of <HI>Discretion.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>It is not almost Credible, <HI>(continues the same Judicious Author)</HI> to fore see, when any Maxim, or <HI>Fundamental-Law</HI> of this Realm <HI>[He means, as to this particular Case,</HI> Trials per Pais, <HI>that is, by</HI> Juries] is Altered, what dangerous Inconveniences do follow. Which most expresly appears by this <HI>MOST UUJUST AND STRANGE ACT:</HI> For hereby, not only <HI>Empson</HI> and <HI>Dudley</HI> themselves; but such <HI>Justices of Peace,</HI> Corrupt Men as they caused to be Authorized, Committed most grievous and
<PB N="13" REF="040005_0017_1015BED6A8DB2EC8"/>
heavy Oppressions and Exactions, Grinding of the Faces of poor Subjects by Penal Laws, be they never so Obsolete, or unfit for the Time, <HI>Suppose, for a Parallel in our Times, putting the Statutes against</HI> Popish Recusants, <HI>in Execution against</HI> Protestant Dissenters, <HI>at a Juncture when</HI> Popery <HI>was just ready to over-run us all]</HI> by Information only, without any Presentment or <HI>Tryal by Jury,</HI> being <HI>THE ANTIENT BIRTH-RIGHT OF THE SUBJECT:</HI> But to Hear and Determine the same, by their Discretion. These, and other like Oppressions and Exactions by, or by Means of <HI>Empson</HI> and <HI>Dudley,</HI> and their Instruments, brought Infinite Trea∣sures to the <HI>King's</HI> Coffers; whereof the <HI>King,</HI> in the End, with great Grief and Compunction, Repented.</HI></P>
<P><HI>This Statute of <HI>11 H. 7</HI> we have Recited, and shewed the Inconveniencies there∣of; to the end, that the like should never hereafter be attempted in any Court of Parliament: And that others might avoid the Fearful End of these Two Time-Servers, <HI>Empson</HI> and <HI>Dudley.</HI></HI></P>
<P>Thus far that <HI>Oracle of our English Laws.</HI> Wherein be pleased to observe:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That he sticks not to call even an <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> most UNJUST AND ST<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>NGE: And in the <HI>Second Part</HI> of his <HI>Institutes, fol.</HI> 51.

<P><HI>THe <HI>Jurors</HI> present, That <HI>Richard Empson,</HI> late of <HI>London,</HI> Knight, late Coun∣sellor of the most Excellent Prince, <HI>Henry the Seventh,</HI> late King of <HI>England,</HI> on the <HI>Tenth</HI> Day of <HI>May,</HI> in the <HI>Twentieth</HI> Year of the said late <HI>King,</HI> and di∣vers Times before and after, at <HI>London,</HI> &amp;c not having <HI>GOD</HI> before his Eyes; but as the <HI>Son of the Devil,</HI> imagining the Honour, Dignity, and Prosperity of the said late <HI>King;</HI> and the Prosperity of His Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> not at all to Value or Regard: But to the end, that he might obtain to be a more Singular Fa∣vourite of the said late <HI>King,</HI> whereby he Himself might be made a Noble or Great Man, &amp; Govern the whole Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> at his Pleasure; Falsly, Deceitfully, and <HI>Treasonably Subverting the Law of England,</HI> did (amongst other Things) the Day &amp; Year aforesaid, at <HI>London,</HI> in the Parish &amp; Ward aforesaid, procure, and cause to be found divers false Inquisitions, and Offices of Intrusions, and Alienations of divers Leige Subject's Mannors, Lands, &amp; Tenements; that they h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld the Man∣nors, Lands, &amp; Tenements in those Inquisitions specified of our Lord the <HI>King, in Capite</HI> or otherwise; whenin Truth it was not so.

Subjects of our Lord, the late <HI>King,</HI> would have tendered and alledged Traverses to the said Inquisitions, in the Court of Him, the said late <HI>King,</HI> according to the Law of <HI>England;</HI> they could not be admitted to those Traverses: But he, the said <HI>Richard Empson,</HI> debarr'd and delay'd them from the same, 'till they had agreed with him, to pay divers Great and Insupportable Fines and Redemptions; as well for the Profit of the said late <HI>King,</HI> as for the proper private Advanta∣ges of him, the said <HI>Richard;</HI> to the great Impoverishment of the said Subjects. And that the said <HI>Richard,</HI> the Day and Year aforesaid, in the Parish &amp; Ward aforesaid, and several Times before and after, divers Leige-Subjects of the said late <HI>King,</HI> holding of our said Lord the <HI>King,</HI> divers Mannors, Lands, and Tenements, by Knight's Service, and themselves being (by the Death of their Ancestors) under Age, and so in the Wardship of the <HI>King,</HI> by Reason of their Tenure, when they came to lawful Age, and ought to have had due Livery of their Mannors, Lands, and Tenements, according to the Custom and Law of <HI>England,</HI> and would have Prosecuted the same according to the Course of <HI>Chancery;</HI> did refuse them so to do, and totally deny and exclude; until they had made with him, the said <HI>Richard,</HI> divers great Fines and Redemptions, more than they could bear; as well for the Gain of the said late <HI>King,</HI> as for the private Benefit of him, the said <HI>Richard:</HI> Whereby many of the said late <HI>King's</HI> People were by such Grievances, and Unjust Extortions many ways vexed: Insomuch, that the Subjects of the said late <HI>King,</HI> did manifoldly murmur, and bear ill Will against the said late <HI>King;</HI> to the great Peril of Him, the said late <HI>King,</HI> His Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and the Subversion of the Laws and Customs of this Realm.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, <HI>(saith my Lord</HI> Cook, Fourth Part <HI>of his</HI> Institutes, fol. 41.) in this <HI>Indictment [Which,</HI> Mutatis mutandis, <HI>we are to suppose, was alike against</HI> Dudley] the Word <HI>Preditorie, [That is to say,</HI> Treasonably] was used but for Aggra∣vation, and as a Preparative (for a Prosecution) to Greater Offences. For they were not to escape with a Charge of <HI>Misdemeanor</HI> only: But in the same Year, they were both Indicted of <HI>High-Treason,</HI> both by the Common-Law, and Act of <HI>Parliament.</HI> And in the Second Year of King <HI>Henry the Eighth,</HI> they both <HI>Lost their Heads.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, that <HI>Profound Judge</HI> speaks of them, who 4. <HI>Instit. fol.</HI> 41. concludes the Story of these Time-serving, Self-designing <HI>Judges,</HI> with this most remark∣able <HI>Epiphonema: Qui eorum vestigiis infistunt, eorum Exitus prehorrescant; Those that shall dare tread their Steps, let them dread</HI> (or expect) <HI>the like dismal Ends.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard Baker,</HI> the <HI>Best</HI> perhaps (for want of a better) of out <HI>Modern English Historians,</HI> gives somewhat a more particular Account of the Fate of these two Corrupt <HI>Hucksters of Law and Justice:</HI> Which be pleas'd to Peruse in his own Words, <HI>fol.</HI> 254.</P>
<P>Speaking of King <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>Eighth</HI>'s general <HI>Pardon,</HI> at his first coming to the Crown, and how he Ordered <HI>Restitution</HI> to be made, of all Goods unjustly taken from any. He Adds:</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="040005_0019_1015BED9772E6760"/>
<Q>And because the Instruments of such Injustice are <HI>Always most Odious;</HI> and nothing gives the People so much Contentment, as to see their Persecutors Punished. He therefore caused <HI>Empson</HI> and <HI>Dudley,</HI> the Two Chief Actors of the late unjust Proceedings, to be Committed to the <HI>Tower,</HI> and divers of their Inferior Agents, called <HI>Promoters</HI></Q> [<HI>The Raskally Informers, Pensionary Affidavit-Men, or (if you please)</HI> Robin Hogg's <HI>of that Age</HI>] <Q>As <HI>Camby, Page, Derby, Wight, Simpson,</HI> and <HI>Storckton,</HI> to be set on the Pillory in <HI>Cornhil,</HI> with Papers on their Heads, and then to Ride through the City with their Faces to the Horse-Tails, with the shame whereof, in Seven Days after they all Dyed in <HI>Newgate.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>Shortly after a Parliament was called; whereof Sir <HI>Thomas Ingleby</HI> was chosen <HI>Speaker:</HI> And therein <HI>Empson,</HI> and <HI>Dudley</HI> were Accused of High-Treason, and after Arraigned; <HI>Edmund Dudley,</HI> in <HI>Guild Hall,</HI> on the <HI>Seven∣teenth</HI> of <HI>July;</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Empson</HI> at <HI>Northampton,</HI> in <HI>October</HI> following. And on the <HI>Seventeenth</HI> of <HI>August,</HI> the year following, [<HI>Which was Anno Domini,</HI> 1510.] they were both of them Beheaded on the <HI>Tower-Hill;</HI> and their Bodies and Heads Buried, the one at <HI>White-Fryars,</HI> the other at the <HI>Black.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And also, by an Act of 1 <HI>H.</HI> 8<HI>th. Cap.</HI> 6. the before-recited Injurious Statute of 11 <HI>H.</HI> 7. was made void, and repeal'd; and the Reason thereof is yielded, for that by Force of the said Act it was manifestly known, that many Sinister and Crafty, Feigned, and Forged Informations, had been pursued against di∣vers of the <HI>King's</HI> Subjects, to their great Damage and wrongful Vexation.</P>
<P><HI>For it is not Credible,</HI> (saith the Lord <HI>Cook, Second Part</HI> of his <HI>Institutes,</HI> fol. 51.) <HI>What horrid Oppressions and Exactions, to the undoing of Infinite Num∣bers of People, were Committed by Colour of that Act, shaking the Fundamental-Law of the Land: The ill Success whereof, and the Fearful Ends of these Two Oppressors, should deter others from Committing the like; and admonish Parlia∣ments, That instead of this Ordinary and</HI> Precious <HI>Tryal,</HI> per Legem Terrae, <HI>they bring not in Absolute and Partial Tryals by Discretion.</HI></P>
<P>So much touching <HI>Empson</HI> and <HI>Dudley,</HI> those Names of <HI>Ignomony</HI> and <HI>Detes∣tation.</HI> Let us now proceed to the <HI>Famous Case of</HI> Ship-Money, in the Reign of King <HI>Charles the First,</HI> and the Extrajudicial and <HI>Illegal</HI> Opinions of the <HI>Judges</HI> therein Delivered, with the dismal <HI>Consequences</HI> thereof, as well to them∣selves, as to the <HI>King,</HI> and whole Realm.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Charles the First</HI> came to the Crown 27 <HI>March,</HI> 1625. In the <HI>Three First</HI> Years of His Reign, he call'd <HI>Three several Parliaments;</HI> but none of them Complying to give so much <HI>Money,</HI> as was Expected: But rather insisting upon Complaints against <HI>Buckingham,</HI> the then Grand <HI>Favourite,</HI> and to have <HI>Publick Grievances</HI> Redressed, They were all <HI>Dissolved</HI> in Discontent; and no more <HI>Parliaments</HI> spoken of, till that of the <HI>Thirteenth of April,</HI> 1640 (which was likewise suddenly <HI>Dissolved.</HI>) During this long Interval, or Absence of those whom the Laws had Entrusted with Keeping the <HI>Right Keys</HI> of the <HI>Pub∣lick Purse,</HI> there were some that would needs be Tampering to <HI>Pick</HI> it; I
<PB N="16" REF="040005_0020_1015BEE0DB852A80"/>
mean, several <HI>little Intrigues</HI> were set on Foot, to Supply the <HI>Court,</HI> and get <HI>Money</HI> from the Subjects, without their <HI>Common Consent</HI> in <HI>Parliament;</HI> (that good Old Course, which <HI>Never Fail'd</HI> any <HI>KING,</HI> upon any Just Occasion, or where they knew it should not be diverted to the <HI>KING</HI>'s Dishonor, and the Nations further Grievance) Of this kind were, 1. The Privy Seals issued. 2. Benevolence required. 3. Commissions of Loan. 4. The Business of Knight∣hood; whereby all persons Seiz'd of Lands and Rents of <HI>Forty Pounds per Annum,</HI> or upwards, were by Proclamation Summon'd, either to appear, and take upon them the Degree of Knighthood, or else were liable to be Fined for Respite of the same. Which (alone saith <HI>Baker, fol.</HI> 449) brought an <HI>Hun∣dred Thousand Pounds</HI> or more, into the <HI>Exchequer.</HI></P>
<P>But all this was still thought too little: These <HI>Devices</HI> might serve for a present <HI>Shift,</HI> once, and no more; but there wanted a <HI>Continual Fund,</HI> or <HI>Con∣stant Supply,</HI> as oft as the <HI>Court</HI> wanted, or tho't fit to require Money, without being beholden to Parliaments. Whereupon, 5<HI>ly.</HI> By the fatal Advice (as 'tis said) of <HI>Noy,</HI> the then Attorney General, the King was put upon this Project of raising Money, by Issuing out Writs, Commanding his Subjects to be Rated, and Assessed in such and such Sums, for Building, and Equipping of <HI>Ships,</HI> for the publick Defence of the Kingdom: Which the said Attorney perswaded his Majesty might be Justified by antient Precedents. In pursuance hereof, the King in the <HI>Ninth</HI> Year of his Reign, Issued out certain Writs of that kind, to the <HI>Sea-Ports,</HI> and <HI>Maritine</HI>-Parts of the Realm: And finding (for the most part) a punctual Obedience, and good Advantage thereby; it was in short time after, advised to Extend the same Charge to all the <HI>Counties</HI> of this Realm, though never so remote from the Seas; wherein, meeting with some that re∣fused to pay, as Conceiving the same Unlawful, the Judges (who by their <HI>Oaths,</HI> are the Kings proper Counsellors in all difficulties concerning the Law) were to be Consulted with. So, a Letter was Written to them, from the King in these Word: [<HI>Baker</HI>'s <HI>Chron. fol.</HI> 455.]</P>

<P>TRusty and Well beloved, We greet you well: Taking into our Princely Consideration, that the Honour and Safety of this our Realm of <HI>England,</HI> (the Preservation whereof, is <HI>Only</HI> Entrusted to our Care) was, and is more dearly concern'd, than in late or former times; as well by divers Counsels, and
<PB N="17" REF="040005_0021_1015BEE2C446DD28"/>
Attempts to take from us the Dominion of the Seas; of which we are sole Lord, and Right Owner, and Proprietor; and the Loss whereof, would be of greatest Danger and Peril to this Kingdom, and other our Dominions, &amp; many other ways. We for the avoiding of these, and the like Dangers; well Weigh∣ing with our self, that where the Good, and Safety of the Kingdom in general is concern'd, and the whole Kingdom in Danger, there the Charge, and De∣fence ought to be Borne by all the Realm in general, did for the preventing so publick a Mischief, resolve with our self, to have a Royal Navy prepared, that might be of Force and Power (with Almighty GOD's Blessing and As∣sistance) to Protect, and Defend this our Realm, and our Subjects therein, from all such Perils and Dangers: And for that purpose, we Issued forth Writs under our great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> Directed to all our Sheriffs of our several Counties of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Wales;</HI> Commanding thereby all our said Subjects in every City, Town, and Village, to provide such a Number of Ships well-furnisht, as might serve for this Royal Purpose; and which might be done with the greatest Equality that could be. In performance whereof, though generally throughout all the Counties of this our Realm, we have found in our Subjects, great Chearfulness, and Alacrity; which we Graciously Interpret as a Testi∣mony, as well of their Dutiful Affection to us, and our Service, as of the Re∣spect they have to the Publick, which well becometh every good Subject. Nevertheless, finding that some few happily out of Ignorance, what the Laws and Customs of this Realm are, or out of a desire to be eased in their Particu∣lars, how General soever their Charge be, or ought to be, have not yet Paid, and Contributed to their several Rates, and Sessments that were set upon them. And foreseeing in our Princely Wisdom, divers Suits and Actions, are not un∣like to be Commenced, and Prosecuted in our several Courts at <HI>Westminster:</HI> We desirous to avoid such Inconveniencies, and out of our Princely Love, and Affection to all our People, being willing to prevent such Errors as any of our Loving Subjects may happen to run into; have thought fit, in a Case of this Nature, to Advise with our Judges, who we doubt not are well Studied, and Informed in the Rights of our Sovereignty; and because the Tryals of our several Courts, by the Formalities in Pleading, will require a long Protraction, We have thought fit by this Letter directed to you All, to require your Judg∣ments in the <HI>Case,</HI> as it is set down in the Inclosed Paper; which will not only gain Time, but also be of more Authority to over-rule any Prejudicate Opinions of others in the Point.</P>

<P>But it is to be noted, That though all the <HI>Judges</HI> did thus Sign this Answer; yet it was not according to all their Opinions; for <HI>Crook</HI> and <HI>Hutton</HI> dis-assent∣ed, and declared, That such a Charge could not be laid by any such Writ; but by <HI>Parliament.</HI> But the Major-Part of the <HI>Judges,</HI> being absolutely Resolved upon that Opinion, pressed them to Subscribe likewise with the rest: for that the Greater Number must involve and conclude the Less; which, they said, was usual in all Cases of Reference; And that the Lesser Number must submit to the Opinion of the More, although they varied in Opinion: As in the Courts of Law; If <HI>Three Judges</HI> agree in Opinion against <HI>One</HI> or <HI>Two,</HI> where there is <HI>Five Judges,</HI> Judgment is to be Entred <HI>per Curiam,</HI> if the <HI>Major Part</HI> agree, and the <HI>Others</HI> are to submit unto it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (These are the very Words of <HI>Judge Crook,</HI> excusing himself for having thus Subscribed: See the <HI>Argu∣ments</HI> on <HI>Hampden</HI>'s <HI>Case,</HI> p. 12.)</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="040005_0023_1015BEE780FB24F8"/>Having thus got the Business <HI>back't</HI> with the <HI>Subscriptions</HI> of all the <HI>Judges</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> the same were <HI>Enrolled</HI> in all the Courts of <HI>Westminster-Hall:</HI> And now, they began to Prosecute briskly, all the <HI>Defaulters;</HI> amongst whom, the Chiefest was <HI>John Hampden</HI> of <HI>Buckingham-shire,</HI> Esquire, who had upon one of these Ship. Writs directed to the Sheriff of that County, been Assessed <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> for his Lands in <HI>Stoke-Mandevil,</HI> in that County; which not being paid, was Certified (amongst others) into the <HI>Chancery,</HI> upon a Writ of <HI>Certio∣rari,</HI> Dated 9 <HI>Martii, Anno</HI> 12 <HI>Car.</HI> by a <HI>Schedule</HI> thereunto annexed; and by a Writ of <HI>Mittimus, Teste</HI> 5 <HI>Maii,</HI> 13 <HI>Car.</HI> transmitted into the <HI>Exchequer;</HI> with a Command there, to do for the Levying of the Sums so Assessed and Un∣paid; <HI>Prout de Jure, &amp; secundum, Legem Regni nostri</HI> Angliae <HI>fuerit faciendum; So as of Right, and according to the Law of our Kingdom of</HI> England <HI>was to be done:</HI> whereupon a <HI>Scire Facius</HI> issued out of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> reciting the said Writs, to warn Mr. <HI>Hampden</HI> (amongst others) to shew Cause, why he should not be Charged with this Money. Upon this, he being Summoned, Appeared, and demanded <HI>Oyer</HI> of those <HI>Writs</HI> and <HI>Schedule;</HI> which being Entred, he <HI>De∣mur'd in Law;</HI> that is, demanded the Opinion and Judgment of the Court of <HI>Exchequer,</HI> Whether this <HI>Writ</HI> were sufficient <HI>in Law,</HI> to Force him to pay the said <HI>Twenty Shillings.</HI></P>
<P>This being a <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>General Case,</HI> the Barons of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> desired the Assistance of the rest of the <HI>Judges,</HI> who did Joyn accordingly. The Case was argued, first, by Counsel on both Sides; and next, by the <HI>Judges</HI> severally; of whom, Sir <HI>Richard Hutton,</HI> Knight, one of the Judges of the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> and Sir <HI>Richard Crook,</HI> Knight, one of the Judges of the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Bench,</HI> in large and learned Arguments, (since Printed) did shew the <HI>Illegality</HI> of such Writs, and gave their Opinion; <HI>That the Defendant</HI> Hampden, <HI>ought not to be Charged.</HI> But the rest of the <HI>Judges</HI> were resolved to carry the Point for the <HI>King:</HI> and accordingly gave their Opinions, <HI>That the Defendant ought to be Charged.</HI> And then, it was the Part of the <HI>Barons</HI> of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> to give <HI>Judg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent;</HI> which was Entred in these Words:</P>
<P><HI>Quod seperalia Brevia predicta, &amp; Retorn' eorundem, ac Schedul' praedict' eisdem An∣nex' ac materia in eisdem content' sufficient' in Lege Exisi' ad praefat</HI> Johannen Hampden <HI>de predictis viginti solidis super ipsum informa, &amp; ex causa praedictae Assessae onerand. Ideo consideratum est per eosdem Barones quod praedictus</HI> Johannes Hampden <HI>de eisdem viginti solidis oneretur, &amp; inde satisfaciat: That the said several Writs and Returns thereof, and the Schedules thereunto annex't, and the Matter in the same contained, are sufficient in Law to Charge the said</HI> John Hampden <HI>with the Twenty Shillings upon him, in the Form, and by Vertue of the Assessment afore∣said imposed. Therefore, it is considered by the said Barons, That the said</HI> John Hampden <HI>shall be Charged, and shall satisfy the same.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Judgment</HI> was imposed, as such an <HI>Infallible Determination</HI> of the Law in this Case, that no further Dispute would be allow'd thereof to any others; insomuch, that a Person of Honour, having a Case depending in the <HI>King</HI>'s-<HI>Bench,</HI> was denyed any Argument or Debate, concerning the <HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Ship-Money,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="040005_0024_1015BEE97AE4ACE8"/>
for no other Reason, but that it had been by the former <HI>Judgment,</HI> de∣cided already in the <HI>Exchequer.</HI></P>
<P>It may perhaps be said: <HI>This Imposition of</HI> Ship Money <HI>was</HI> small <HI>and</HI> incon∣siderable; <HI>Mr.</HI> Hampden, <HI>a Gentleman of a fair Estate, was Assessed but</HI> Twen∣ty Shillings: <HI>And, Why should any Body scruple such a petty Business, when the</HI> King <HI>Commanded it? Was not the</HI> Redemy <HI>far worse than the</HI> Disease? <HI>Why should any Subject exspend a great deal of Money in Law, to avoid Payment of so</HI> Trivial <HI>a Sum? Or, What Harm could accrue to the</HI> Publick, <HI>by the</HI> Judges <HI>allowing the</HI> King <HI>Power to Impose such an Assessment, when it was for the De∣fence of the Realm from</HI> Eminent <HI>and</HI> Imminent <HI>Danger, and he exerted that Power so favourably,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In <HI>Answer</HI> to such <HI>Objections,</HI> it must be said; That true it is, it was then only Mr. <HI>Hampden</HI>'s Case; but the whole Nation, every individual Subject of <HI>England,</HI> was concern'd in it: nay, so far concern'd, that all his Estate and Li∣berty was therein given up. The <HI>Question</HI> was not <HI>Quantum,</HI> but <HI>Quo Jure</HI>? If Publick Danger might give the <HI>King</HI> Title to lay Impositions without a <HI>Parliament,</HI> and He alone were <HI>Judge</HI> of such Danger, When might it not be alledged? If <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> were Assessed on Mr. <HI>Hampden</HI> that Year, How did it appear, but <HI>Twenty Pounds</HI> might be required the next, and <HI>Two Thou∣sand Pounds</HI> the Year following? And, What Use, what Occasion would the <HI>Court</HI> have had for ever afterwards of a <HI>Parliament</HI>? But as to the <HI>Illegality</HI> of these <HI>Ship Writs,</HI> I refer the <HI>Reader</HI> to Judge <HI>Crook's Argument;</HI> where the same is Demonstrated to be against the <HI>Common Law,</HI> against divers <HI>Statutes,</HI> not to be maintain'd by any <HI>Prerogative,</HI> or Power Royal, unwarrantable by any former <HI>Precedents,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Let us see then, what were the <HI>Consequences</HI> of these <HI>Extra judicial</HI> Opinions, and this <HI>Illegal</HI> Judgment of the <HI>Judges.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> As to the <HI>King:</HI> They thereby mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led him (as much as in them lay) to Discompose the Harmony of <HI>Government;</HI> to Entrench upon the <HI>Property</HI> of His Subjects; and (contrary to his Intentions) by Colour of Right, to vio∣late the Laws, which, do doubt, that <HI>Good Prince</HI> meant to have preserv'd in∣violable</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As to the <HI>Subjects:</HI> They were not only hereby Injured, but their <HI>Affections Alienated</HI> from their Sovereign; which to occasion, is to doubt a very High (because almost Irreparable) <HI>Treason.</HI></P>
<P>The Genuine Sense of these <HI>Resolutions,</HI> being no less than this; That the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>often</HI> as Himself pleaseth, may declare the Kingdom to be in Danger, and that so often, His Majesty, for Prevention of such Dangers, may, by His Writ under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> alter the <HI>Property</HI> of the Subjects Goods, without their Consent in <HI>Parliament;</HI> and that in <HI>such Propor∣tions</HI> as His Majesty shall think fit: And besides, may deprive them of the <HI>Liberty</HI> of their Persons, and that in such Manner as Himself shall please.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> As to the <HI>Judges</HI> themselves: It prov'd deservedly <HI>Fatal;</HI> For no sooner was a <HI>Parliament</HI> Call'd, but they were call'd to Account for these their Illegal Opinions and Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="040005_0025_1015BEEBC47D1BE0"/>And after a long Debate, on <HI>Monday</HI> the <HI>Seventh</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> 1640 these <HI>Four</HI> several <HI>Votes</HI> Passed upon them, without so much as <HI>One Negative Voice</HI> to any of them, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>THat the Charge imposed upon the Subjects, for the Providing and Fur∣nishing of Ships; and the Assessments for Raising of Money for that pur∣pose, commonly called Ship-Money, are against the Laws of the Realm, the Sub∣jects Right of Property, and contrary to former Resolutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That the Extrajudicial Opinions of the Judges, Published in the</HI> Star-Chamber, <HI>and Inrolled in Courts as</HI> Westminster (<HI>before Recited) in the whole, and in every part of them are against the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, and the Liberty of the Subjects, and contrary to former Resolutions in Parliament; and to the Petition of Right.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>That the writ to the Sheriff of</HI> Bucks <HI>(particularly Recited) and the other Writs, commonly called Ship-Writs; are against the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, and the Liberty of the Subjects, and contrary to former Reso∣lutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>That the Judgment in Mr.</HI> Hampden's <HI>Case (as before Recited) in the matter and substance thereof; and in that it was conceived that Mr.</HI> Hampden <HI>was any way Chargeable, is against the Laws of the Realm, the Right of Property, the Liberty of the Subjects, and contrary to former Resolutions in Parliament, and to the Petition of Right.</HI></P>
<P>These <HI>Votes</HI> being Transmitted by the <HI>Commons</HI> to the <HI>House of Lords;</HI> Their Lordships did Concur therein. And on <HI>Fryday</HI> the 26. of <HI>February,</HI> 1640. It was Ordered by the Lords <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Temporal,</HI> in the High <HI>Court of Par∣liament,</HI> Assembled; That the <HI>Lord Keeper,</HI> or <HI>Master of the Rolls,</HI> the <HI>Two</HI> Lord <HI>Chief Justices,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Chief Baron;</HI> and likewise the <HI>Chief Clerk of the Star-Chamber,</HI> should bring into the Upper <HI>House of Parliament,</HI> the <HI>Re∣cords</HI> of the Judgment against Mr. <HI>Hampden,</HI> concerning <HI>Ship-Money,</HI> in each of those several Courts, and that a <HI>Vacat</HI> thereof should be made. And that a Copy of the Judgment of the <HI>Parliament,</HI> concerning the <HI>Illegality</HI> there∣of, should be Delivered to the several <HI>Judges of Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e;</HI> and that they should be required to Publish the same in all the <HI>Circuits.</HI> Which on the 27. of the same <HI>February,</HI> was done accordingly: the said <HI>Records</HI> being <HI>Vacated,</HI> and the <HI>Rolls</HI> Cross'd with a Pen in the <HI>House of Lords,</HI> and Subscribed with the <HI>Clerk</HI> of the <HI>Parliament's</HI> Hand.</P>
<P>And soon after, several of the before-named Judges were <HI>Impeached</HI> for the same in <HI>Parliament:</HI> And not daring to stand the <HI>Shock,</HI> some of them, as the Lord <HI>Chief Justice Finch,</HI> Fled beyond the Seas; and <HI>others</HI> Absconded. And soon after, came on the Unnatural <HI>Civil Wars,</HI> so Destructive to <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Kingdom;</HI> which, though no way Justifiable, yet it cannot be denied; but they were not a little <HI>Occasion'd,</HI> and the Animosities of the People, blown into an
<PB N="22" REF="040005_0026_1015BEEF2E050950"/>
Untameable <HI>Flame,</HI> by these base Traiterous Proceedings of those <HI>Sycophant Judges.</HI> And <HI>Woe unto those</HI> (say Sacred <HI>Oracles) by whom Offences come.</HI></P>
<P>However, after so many dismal Experiences, and fair Warnings, and the Mi∣raculous <HI>Restauration</HI> of His present Majesty, our Gracious Soveraign (whom <HI>God</HI> long Preserve) a <HI>Prince</HI> of Incomparable Lenity, and Good-natur'd be∣yond Example; it might be hoped, that none, Preferr'd to the <HI>Publick Seats of Justice,</HI> durst to have Acted so contrary to His Royal Inclinations, as to violate those <HI>Laws,</HI> which He Himself has <HI>Sworn</HI> to Maintain, and Intrusted them to <HI>Administer:</HI> Yet so Base and Extravagant are some, as even to abuse the Favours of the <HI>Best of Princes,</HI> and pufft up with Preferment, will take no Admonition from the Falls of their <HI>Head-strong</HI> Predecessors; but still presume to fully those <HI>Ermins,</HI> (the <HI>Emblems</HI> of <HI>Innocency</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI>) which they wear, and adventure on the same Destructive Precipices.</P>
<P>You have heard, how heinously our Prudent Ancestors resented the Viola∣tion of their <HI>Liberties,</HI> (though by an Act) in Tryals of the Free-born People of <HI>England</HI> WITHOUT JURIES. Next to which, is the <HI>Ruffling, Hectoring,</HI> and <HI>Over-awing</HI> of <HI>Juries:</HI> For, What real Difference is there, betwixt allowing no <HI>Juries</HI> at all, and <HI>Menacing</HI> them into a Compliance (contrary to <HI>Law,</HI> and their own <HI>Consciences</HI>) with the Corrupt Humours, and Time-serving Interests of ill Judges? Of this Crime, the Lord <HI>Chief Justice Keeling,</HI> about the Year 1666. (a Time when <HI>God</HI>'s General Judgments on this Sinful Land, might have awakened them to greater Circumspection and Uprightness) was not only Guilty, but Question'd for the same, even by <HI>That</HI> very <HI>Parliament,</HI> which was never extraordinarily Celebrated for bringing <HI>Publick Vermine</HI> to Punish∣ment: Yet such a Sense they had of these ill Practises, that in their <HI>Journal,</HI> we find the following <HI>Votes</HI> on this Occasion.</P>

<P><HI>Resolved, as followeth;</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the Proceedings of the said <HI>Lord Chief Justice,</HI> in the Cases now Reported, are <HI>Innovations</HI> in the Tryals of Men for their Lives and Liberties; and that he hath used an Arbitrary, and Illegal Power, which is of <HI>dangerous</HI> Consequence to the Lives and Liberties of the People of <HI>England,</HI> and tends to the Introducing of an Arbitrary Government.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That in the Place of <HI>Judicature,</HI> the <HI>Lord Chief Justice</HI> hath Un∣dervalued, Vilified, and Contemned <HI>MAGNA CHARTA;</HI> the great Preserver of our Lives, Liberties, and Property.</P>

<P>Here you see, the ill Practices of that <HI>Chief Justice</HI> were <HI>Branded</HI> in <HI>Parlia∣ment,</HI> and he was ordered to be Prosecuted; though by reason of the <HI>Houses</HI> being <HI>Prorogued,</HI> and he himself not long after <HI>Dying</HI> in <HI>Discontent,</HI> we do not find there were any further <HI>Proceedings</HI> made therein.</P>
<P>At the Sessions for <HI>London, Sept.</HI> 1670 <HI>William Penn,</HI> and <HI>William Mead,</HI> (Two of the People commonly called <HI>Quakers</HI>) being Indicted: <HI>For that they the Fourteenth of</HI> August <HI>before, did with others, to the Number of</HI> Three Hundred, <HI>in</HI> Grace-Church-Street, <HI>Unlawfully and Tumultuously Assemble,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>by reason whereof a great Tumult did there happen, in Contempt of the</HI> King, <HI>great Disturbance of the Peace, &amp; Terror of the People,</HI> &amp;c. And the <HI>Jury</HI> (after ha∣ving been several times sent back, and kept <HI>Close</HI> from the <HI>Saturday</HI> till the <HI>Monday</HI> Morning) bringing them in <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> Sir <HI>John Howel</HI> then <HI>Recorder</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> presumed to <HI>Fine</HI> the said Jury <HI>Forty Marks</HI> a Man, and to <HI>Lye in Prison</HI> till paid. Being thus in Custody, <HI>Edward Bushel,</HI> one of the said <HI>Jury</HI>-Men, brought his <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> in the Court of <HI>Common-Pleas;</HI> and upon a long Argument, it was Adjudged by the whole Court, That the said <HI>Fining</HI> and <HI>Commitment</HI> was <HI>Illegal:</HI> Whereupon the said <HI>Bushel</HI> was Discharged, and left to bring his Action for False Imprisonment, against the said <HI>Recorder:</HI> Which Case is Reported by the Lord <HI>Vaughan,</HI> at that time Chief Justice of the said Court, in his <HI>Reports, Licensed</HI> and <HI>Approved</HI> of by the present Lord-Chancel∣lor of <HI>England;</HI> Sir <HI>William Scroggs,</HI> since Lord Chief-Justice of the <HI>King's-Bench,</HI> my Lord <HI>North,</HI> Chief Justice of the <HI>Common Pleas;</HI> and all the Judges of <HI>England.</HI> But as to the <HI>Illegality</HI> of any Courts <HI>Imposing upon, Menacing, Fining,</HI> or <HI>Imprisoning Juries,</HI> see a small <HI>Treatise,</HI> Entituled, <HI>The English-Man's Right,</HI> Printed for <HI>R.

<P>This well contrived, necessary <HI>Oath,</HI> prescribed by the Prudence of our Fore-Fathers, would bear a large <HI>Comment;</HI> but we must hasten, and shall only remark:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That they Swear, <HI>Well and Truly</HI> (that is, <HI>Uprightly,</HI> and according to <HI>Law) to Serve the</HI> King, <HI>and his People.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That they shall do <HI>Equal Right, and Execution of Law, to all the</HI> King's <HI>Subjects, Rich and Poor;</HI> (that is, without <HI>Partiality, Favour, Malice,</HI> &amp;c.) <HI>Justice</HI> is Pictured <HI>Blind</HI> in respect of the <HI>Subject,</HI> not the <HI>Object:</HI> She has a <HI>Ballance,</HI> not to weigh <HI>Gold,</HI> but the <HI>Crime:</HI> She has regard to <HI>Offences,</HI> not <HI>Persons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That if any <HI>Letters from the King</HI> (unduly obtain'd, for so all such are supposed to be) shall be brought to them, <HI>contrary to Law,</HI> they are not to
<PB N="25" REF="040005_0029_1015BEF7A20DAE90"/>
regard them; much less are they to value any <HI>Verbal</HI> Commands, or little <HI>Ras∣kally Insinuations</HI> of any <HI>Court Favourites,</HI> hussing <HI>Grandeos,</HI> or small <HI>Minions</HI> of State.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That by this their <HI>Oath, Judges</HI> are to proceed according to <HI>Law;</HI> their Business is <HI>Jus Dicere,</HI> to Declare and Administer the Laws Establish'd; not <HI>Jus Dare,</HI> to Impose their own Whimsical, Arbitrary, <HI>Peevish,</HI> or Self-de∣signing Opinions, for <HI>Law;</HI> or to Usurp a <HI>Legislative</HI> Power, so as deliver that to be Law, which in truth is not so. And if they shall presume to offend here∣in, they are <HI>Exemplarily</HI> to be punished: For since 'tis a known <HI>Maxim</HI> of Law, <HI>Ignorantia Juris non excusat, That Ignorance of the Law shall ex∣cuse no Man;</HI> (The Reason of which, is, because every Man a supposed to be <HI>Privy,</HI> and consenting to all our Laws, by his <HI>Representatives</HI> in <HI>Par∣liament.)</HI> How much less are <HI>Judges</HI> (whose <HI>Profession</HI> and <HI>Office</HI> it is to Understand the Law; and therefore, must take Notice of it, at their <HI>Peril</HI>) to be Indulg'd? Under what Character will they plead Excuse? Are they Persons of known <HI>Learning,</HI> and strong <HI>Natural Parts,</HI> great <HI>Reading,</HI> exquisite <HI>Eloquence, &amp;c</HI>? All this but <HI>aggravates</HI> their Fault, that they should abuse such good Gifts, to the Dishonour of the <HI>King</HI> that Commissions them, and Prejudice of His <HI>People</HI> that expected more exact Dealings from such E∣minent Accomplishments. Will they shelter themselves under the before-mentioned <HI>Plea</HI> of <HI>Ignorance</HI>? This is already shewn to be an Invalid Alle∣gation; and besides, 'tis a Reflection on that <HI>Royal Power</HI> that Preferr'd them: And, What infinite Mischiefs (of which there is no Particular <HI>Complaint</HI> or <HI>Information</HI>) may the Subjects suffer in their <HI>Lives,</HI> and <HI>Fortunes,</HI> under such <HI>Ignorance,</HI> which is always attended with Equal <HI>Presumption</HI>? Or, <HI>lastly,</HI> Sup∣pose it should be offered in their Favour, That for some time, at first, they were <HI>Upright,</HI> and have had the Reputation of Prudence and Integrity, in all Cases, except <HI>such</HI> and <HI>such:</HI> for which NOW they are questioned: To this it may be fitly Answer'd, (as he of <HI>Lacedemon</HI> said of the <HI>Athenians</HI>) If they carryed themselves <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll,</HI> when Time was, and now <HI>Ill,</HI> they deserve a <HI>Double</HI> Punishment; because they are not <HI>Good,</HI> as they <HI>were:</HI> and because they are <HI>Evil,</HI> as they <HI>were not.</HI> The <HI>Judges,</HI> 'tis true, are declared in the <HI>Parliament-Roll</HI> of the 11 <HI>R.</HI> 2. to be <HI>Executors</HI> of the <HI>Statutes,</HI> Judgments, and Ordinances of <HI>Parliament:</HI> But they must not make themselves the <HI>Executioners</HI> of them too, by endeavouring the Destruction of the Fundamentals of our <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Liberties.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> is the <HI>Temple,</HI> the <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> whither the Subject is to run for Shelter and Defence: But if the Judges, <HI>Sacerdotes Justitiae,</HI> those <HI>Priests of Justice,</HI> shall, like those of <HI>Delphos,</HI> utter <HI>False, Ambiguous,</HI> and <HI>Time-Serving Oracles,</HI> Where is the Comfort of the Poor <HI>Votaries</HI>? Will not this <HI>Sanctuary</HI> then become <HI>Templum sine Numine,</HI> like that of the <HI>Roman Em∣perour,</HI> who after he had built it, put no <HI>Gods</HI> into it? We shall have the Dead <HI>Killing Letter</HI> of the <HI>Law;</HI> but not the Quickening, Preserving <HI>Sense</HI> of it: The Fabrick and Formalities of the <HI>Temple;</HI> but the <HI>Goddess Astraea,</HI> and

the <HI>Dii Tutelares,</HI> all that should Conserve our <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Properties,</HI> will be vanish't: And instead thereof, we shall have but an <HI>Indian Pa-god,</HI> a frightful, terrible <HI>Idol</HI> of <HI>Arbitrary Power,</HI> delighting in <HI>Humane Sacrifices,</HI> and only Adorable for Averting that <HI>Mischief,</HI> with which it threatens us.</P>
<P>But <HI>Contraria juxta se posita magis elucescunt: Contraries illustrate each other.</HI> We have hitherto Treated the <HI>Reader</HI> with <HI>Dolesome Narratives</HI> of <HI>Lewd Judges:</HI> Let us now (briefly) Entertain him with an Account of some <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Imitable</HI> Ones; <HI>Memoria Justi in Aeternum.</HI></P>
<P>In the Reign of King <HI>H.</HI> 4 His Son and Heir apparent (then a <HI>Wild Youth,</HI> but afterwards as Solid, and Renowned a King, as most that have sway'd the <HI>English</HI> Scepter) hearing that one of his Companions was Arraigned for Felony before the Lord Chief Justice of <HI>England</HI> (I am sorry my narrow Reading has not brought me acquainted with his Honourable Name) came to the Bar, and offered to take away the <HI>Prisoner</HI> by force; but being withstood by the said Chief Justice, stepped to him, and <HI>Struck</HI> him over the Face; whereat the Judge nothing daunted, rose up, and with a <HI>Gravity</HI> becoming his Dignity, told him, That he did not this Affront to <HI>Him,</HI> but to the King his <HI>Father,</HI> in whose Place he sate; and therefore, forthwith Committed him to Prison. The Prince <HI>Over-aw'd</HI> with the Majesty of the <HI>Sage Judge</HI>'s Expressions, calmly Suffered himself to be carried away by an ordinary <HI>Tip-Staff;</HI> which being told the King, He not a little Rejoyced, both that he had a <HI>Judge</HI> of such Coura∣gious Integrity; and a <HI>Son</HI> of such Submissive Obedience to his Laws, <HI>Vide Baker fol.</HI> 163.</P>
<P>The Famous Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> having required a <HI>Charge</HI> upon divers of Her Subjects, by particular Letters from the Lords of Her Council, of several <HI>Sums</HI> of Money, for present Aid towards Her Wars in <HI>Ireland;</HI> hearing that one of Her <HI>Judges,</HI> viz, Mr. Justice <HI>Walmesley,</HI> being conven'd before the said Lords, for Non Payment thereof, thereby Discouraging others; had Answered, That it was <HI>Contrary to Law</HI> that the same should be Imposed, there being an Express <HI>Statute</HI> against it; which He being a <HI>Judge,</HI> was bound by his Oath, to signifie to Her Majesty, he being (as much as in him lay) a Conservator of the <HI>Queens Oath</HI> in that behalf; Her Majesty was much Offended, that any such Imposition had been pretended to, and Commanded that it should be stopped from further <HI>Gathering;</HI> and to such as had paid it, their Money, by Her express Order, was <HI>Restored. Judge Crooks Argument</HI> in <HI>Hampden's Case,</HI> p. 57.</P>
<P>In the 29th. of the same Queen, Her Majesty having Erected a New-Office in the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> for making of <HI>Supersedeas</HI> on <HI>Exigents,</HI> She Grants it to one <HI>Cavendish</HI> Her Servant; sends to have him admitted, but the Judges delay the doing thereof, On this Reason, because the <HI>Prothonotaries,</HI> and <HI>Philizers</HI> Claimed the making those Writs. The Queen sends a <HI>Sharp</HI> Letter, and Com∣mands them forthwith to Admit him: Then She sends a more positive Com∣mand, requiring the Reason of their <HI>Contempt</HI> and Disobedience. The Judges return the beforementioned Reason to the Lord <HI>Keeper,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="040005_0031_1015BEFCCD010678"/>
(no mean Man in those Days) upon which, the Queen sends a <HI>Fourth Pe∣remptory</HI> Message for their Admitting him, with this Reason: That if the o∣thers were put out, they were <HI>Rich,</HI> and Able Men, and that Her Courts of Justice were <HI>Open,</HI> where they might Demand their Right; for this was not to debar them <HI>Therefrom,</HI> but only to put them to their <HI>Action.</HI> The <HI>Honest Judges</HI> returned this Answer, That the Queen had taken Her <HI>Oath,</HI> for the due Execution of Justice <HI>According to Law,</HI> and they did not doubt, but when Her Majesty was Informed it was against the Law, She would Act therein as be∣came her. For their own parts, they had taken an <HI>Oath</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> to <HI>Her,</HI> and the COMMON-WEALTH; And if they should do it without <HI>Process</HI> of Law before them, and only upon Her Command put the others out of Possession, though the Right remained to them, it were a Breach of their <HI>Oath;</HI> and there∣fore, if the Fear of <HI>God</HI> were not Sufficient, they told Her the Punishment, that was Inflicted upon their <HI>Predecessors</HI> for Breach of their Oaths (citing <HI>Thorpe,</HI> &amp;c) might be a sufficient <HI>Warning</HI> to them: Whereupon the Queen hearing these Reasons, was Satisfied; and the said Judges heard no more of this Business.</P>
<P>To Descend nearer our own Times, we cannot omit that grand Example of <HI>Uprightness,</HI> the ever Famous Sir <HI>Matthew Hale,</HI> late Lord Chief Justice of the King's-Bench; a <HI>Miracle</HI> for all other parts of <HI>Polite</HI> and <HI>Serious</HI> Learning, as well as profound knowledge in the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> Of whom I shall yet, not offer any particular <HI>Instances,</HI> since his whole Life was one continued Thread of <HI>Sincere, and Understanding Justice:</HI> For as easily you might have justled the <HI>Sun</HI> out of the <HI>Ecliptick,</HI> as to have warp'd him from his constant Road of <HI>In∣tegrity.</HI> An exact <HI>Standard</HI> whereby <HI>Future Princes</HI> may measure the Quali∣fications of their <HI>Judges;</HI> for though he were a most <HI>Loyal,</HI> and Zealous Servant to the <HI>Crown;</HI> yet he was so far from being ever <HI>Impeached</HI> by the <HI>Represen∣tative Body</HI> of the Nation, that no one <HI>Single</HI> Person (no not of those that were <HI>Cast</HI> before him) were ever heard to complain of his Conduct.</P>
<P>And if any <HI>Latter</HI> Judges have been dismis'd by false Tales of Sycophant <HI>Whisperers,</HI> or for opposing base <HI>Illegal Arbitrary Interests;</HI> as they have the Invaluable Satisfaction of a good <HI>Conscience</HI> for their Comfort; so they may be assured, they still appear more Glorious in the Eyes of all good <HI>English</HI> Men at present, and will be Recorded more Venerable to Posterity, than any <HI>Robes</HI> or Preferment, sullied with <HI>Bribery, Flattery,</HI> or <HI>Treacherous</HI> Compli∣ances, could render them.</P>
<P>However, we hope the <HI>Various Examples,</HI> we have here Enumerated from Authentick <HI>Records,</HI> and <HI>Histories,</HI> may be sufficient to Deter future <HI>Judges</HI> from Ill Courses; and satisfie all the World, both in the <HI>Justice</HI> of the Parlia∣ments late Proceedings in this Case, and the <HI>Reasonableness</HI> of their <HI>Vote</HI> and intended <HI>Bill,</HI> That <HI>Judges</HI> henceforth should hold their Places, and Salaries, not <HI>Ad Placitum,</HI> but <HI>Quam Diu se bene gesserint.</HI> Which was the principal Aim of these Papers. <HI>Fiat Justitia.</HI></P>
