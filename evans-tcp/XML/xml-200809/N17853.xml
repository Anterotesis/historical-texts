</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the former part of this chapter we have the parable of the sow∣er, and this cautionary precept of our SAVIOUR was probably intended as a practical applica∣tion of it. The parable itself is undoubtedly familiar to all of you. The mor∣al instruction which it conveys is very obvious. It was manifestly designed to represent the preach∣ing of the Gospel, to mark the diversity which is observable in its reception, and to point out the manner in which it must be heard, so as to admit of the blessed effect, to which it is ultimately directed. CHRIST in his discourse teaches us, that to secure the personal advantages, and final benefit of a preached Gospel, the hearing of it must be like the operation of good soil, upon seed which is sown in it. The soil must be of sufficient depth to receive the seed, admit of its taking suitably deep root, favour the principle of vegetation, and its progress to maturity, or there will
<PB N="6" REF="023136_0004_0FBC83EDDE3E3BB8"/>
be no fruit. So in the exposition of the parable, CHRIST explicitly assures us, that no good and per∣manent benefit can be secured to hearers, from the preaching of the most weighty and interesting truths, unless they are heard in a manner, correspondent to their solemnity, and the obligations which attend them. He teaches us, that neither the supine, stu∣pid multitude, who give a transient attention to the Gospel, as a matter of course only; nor those un∣feeling triflers, who attend to it merely as a matter of speculation; nor even those, who for a little time are convinced of the reality and importance of the truths of Christianity, but soon lose this conviction, in scenes of business or gaiety; can, in the indulgence of their respective habits, be savingly benefited by the preaching of the Gospel. The substance of what CHRIST urges, is this, that men must be in that moral situation which will admit of a due reception of the Gospel, that they must be disposed to receive it cor∣dially, that they must reduce it to a uniform and con∣scientious practice, and that then, and then only, will they bring forth fruit to the glory of GOD and their own salvation. Such being the importance of hear∣ing the Gospel rightly; with great force and propri∣ety did CHRIST address the cautionary injunction to his disciples, and by them to us, <HI>Take heed how ye hear.</HI> And it cannot but affect us with a particular solemnity that he adds, <HI>for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken, even that which he seemeth to have.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the passage, connected with the explanatory observations which have been made, we are obvious∣ly
<PB N="7" REF="023136_0005_0FBC83EF3646DA08"/>
taught these important practical truths; that re∣specting the preaching of the Gospel there are duties appropriate to ministers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">FOR unless the Gospel is duly preached, it cannot be heard, <HI>How can they hear without a preacher?</HI></NOTE>; that there are also duties which are peculiar to, and binding on the people, as hearers; and that the discharge of these duties re∣ciprocally, is essential to the security of the saving, and final benefit of a preached Gospel. Let us then pursue the following arrangement in the considera∣tion of this subject:</P>

</LIST>
<P N="1">I. WE are to inquire what is to be heard; or what are the chief things which ought to be in∣sisted on, in the due publication of the Gospel.</P>
<P>HERE let us for a moment consider what is the <HI>de∣sign</HI> of the Gospel; for that will help us to deter∣mine, what those truths are, which should be chiefly insisted on, in the preaching of it. The Gospel is not designed to develop the principles of civil gov∣ernment, or furnish a philosophical survey of the material system. It is not designed to make men politicians, artists, or proficients in husbandry. It is not designed to teach them skill, or to stimulate them to enterprize, in worldly pursuits; but to make them
<PB N="8" REF="023136_0006_0FBC83F0EC4701B8"/>
holy. Its grand object is, to exhibit the true char∣acter, the will, and the purposes of GOD; to display the medium of salvation for sinners; and to mark out the path in which they must go, that they may be assimilated to GOD, be reinstated in his favour, and become candidates for, and the final possessors of celestial blessedness. Whatever truths then have an obvious direction to these objects, and are inti∣mately connected with them, are to be principally insisted on in the ministration of the Gospel. Give me leave to descend to a few particulars.</P>
<P>IT cannot be supposed that men will be truly re∣ligious, that they will love GOD, and be happy in him, unless they have just views of his character. The attributes of the DEITY then, as the foundation of all religion, and forming the distinguishing glories of the divine character, are to be illustrated, as far as they are discoverable, from the light of nature, and the holy scriptures. It is not conceivable that men will feel that they are sinners, the objects of divine abhorrence, and exposed to punishment, and realize their need of that atonement which the Gospel pro∣poses, unless they know whether they are transgressors of the divine law; and this they cannot decide un∣til they become acquainted with it. The moral law then, as a transcript of the divine nature, and containing the sum of our duty, is to be distinctly explained, and warmly enforced. Farther—How can men realize their proper moral standing with respect to GOD and his kingdom, and their need of supernatural agency to transform and sanctify, and of the blood of JESUS to cleanse them, unless they
<PB N="9" REF="023136_0007_0FBC83F467B348C8"/>
are made acquainted with their fallen, <HI>i. e.</HI> with their totally sinful state? The history then of the original lapse of human nature, and the extensively dreadful consequences of it, must be faithfully given. The decided declarations of Scripture, on this subject, must not be withheld; that <HI>we are by nature children of wrath, being children of disobedience</HI>; that <HI>we are dead in trespasses and sins</HI>; that <HI>the carnal heart is en∣mity against GOD, not subject to his law, neither indeed can be.</HI> Hence too the doctrine of regeneration, as wrought by the agency of the HOLY SPIRIT, is a cardinal doctrine of the Bible; is essential to the scheme of religion there exhibited; and though called in question by some, and derided by others, is one which cannot be too critically explained, or too pe∣remptorily urged. It is so clearly taught by CHRIST and his Apostles, that the christian preacher, in his publick ministrations, cannot pass it over, or conceal its importance, without treason against his Master, and the cause he has professedly espoused. That men may know whether they exercise a holy trust in GOD, and are prepared to join the triumph of An∣gels in his government; and that they may be led to anticipations of that triumph; the nature of the divine administration, with respect to the immutable plan of it, as laid in the eternal and predeterminate counsels of the DEITY, as comprehending the conditions of creatures, and operating in the way of a gracious election, holy sovereignty, and perfect benevolence, is to be held up to view in all its extent and glory. In connexion with these subjects, that which was the leading one of the Apostles' addresses, the salvation of the cross, in respect to its author, its nature, and
<PB N="10" REF="023136_0008_0FBC83F5FA03E9D8"/>
issue, as it must warm the heart, will be frequently the theme of the faithful preacher. To his fellow sinners he will exhibit the LORD JESUS CHRIST, in his absolute divinity, as the only Saviour. The dif∣ferent offices which belong to his mediatorial charac∣ter he will explain: The nature and sufficiency of his atonement he will delineate: The terms of an inter∣est in it, repentance and faith, he will illustrate and enforce; together with its infallible safety as a ground of dependence. It is highly important also, that the invariable connexion between faith, and a personal compliance with the duties which we owe to GOD and our fellow creatures, be fully urged. And that men may be persuaded to live by faith on the SON of GOD, and to lead holy and unblamable lives; that sinners may be awakened, and saints prompted to zeal and diligence, the solemn realities of death, judgment, and eternity, are to be displayed in their utmost seriousness. The endless horrors of the world of punishment, and the glories of the heavenly paradise, are to be paint∣ed in all their solemnity and lustre. Publick and prevalent sins are to be the subject of reproof. Men's accountableness at the bar of GOD for every thing done here in the body, is to be solemnly taught; and many other interesting topicks there are, which a true minister of CHRIST, in fidelity to his Master, and the souls of men, will insist on with honest fervour and boldness. In a word, the whole counsel of GOD, as contained in the Holy Scriptures, is to be exhibited without partiality or palliation; as becomes a dying man, standing on the verge of eternity, and soon to leave the present scene, for the solemn adjudications of another, and an endless state. We are now to shew</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="11" REF="023136_0009_0FBC83F78DEC7018"/>II. HOW such an exhibition of the Gospel is to be heard. <HI>Take heed how ye hear.</HI></P>
<P>THESE, my friends, are not mere philosophick speculations, or matters of transient occurrence. They are truths, weighty, divine and eternal; in which the everlasting life or death of every son and daugh∣ter of Adam is embarked. These are truths which the SON of GOD came into the world to reveal and propagate; they have been sealed by his blood; they have been witnessed to, by the tragical deaths of innumerable martyrs; and there is no room to doubt, but that the Gospel which consists of them, will operate as a savour of life unto life, or of death unto death, to every one of us here present. We shall all of us soon find, that such is the importance of hearing suitably, this Gospel, that <HI>whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken, even that which he seemeth to have.</HI> How then should we hear?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WITH honest and good hearts.</HI> This is what CHRIST expressly inculcates, in a verse preceding our text. <HI>But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it and bring forth fruit with patience.</HI> Nothing is so in∣superable an obstacle to saving improvement, under the preaching of the Gospel, as a vitiated and un∣sanctified heart. It is indeed as absolutely impossi∣ble, that a heart unsubdued by divine grace, and re∣taining its native aversion to divine things, should well receive and duly improve the Gospel, as that a rock should receive seed, and rear it up to fruit∣fulness. Hence the apostle says, <HI>They that are in the
<PB N="12" REF="023136_0010_0FBC83F8EEBD2620"/>
flesh,</HI> they who retain a depraved heart, and are not led by the SPIRIT, <HI>cannot please GOD</HI>; those who <HI>re∣ceive not the truth in the love of it</HI> are expressly con∣demned. What can be more indisputable, and ob∣vious, than that holy exercises are absolutely neces∣sary to render a performance beneficial, and accepta∣ble? What is there of duty in a prayer offered up with the lips only, without sincerity or affection? What is there in an external act of charity, which can be acceptable to GOD, when he himself, and the proper motives of action, are disregarded? Of what advantage was it to the disobedient Jews, to be ad∣dressed with the glorious and endearing truths which CHRIST preached, while they were his inveterate enemies, and were resolved to persecute him, and his disciples, to the last extremity? Hence holiness of heart is the primary thing enjoined in the Scrip∣tures. <HI>My son give me thine heart.—Cast away from you all your transgressions, whereby you have transgressed against me, and make you a new heart, and a new spirit, for, Why will ye die, O house of Israel?</HI> How corres∣pondent with this sentiment is the injunction of the apostle—<HI>As new born babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE truths of the Gospel must be heard with <HI>solemn and serious attention.</HI></P>
<P>IT certainly can answer no valuable purpose for you, my friends, to come to the house of GOD, un∣less you attend seriously to the proper business before you. If you bring the world with you into the sanctuary—if instead of worshipping GOD in spirit and in truth, and giving that attention to divine
<PB N="13" REF="023136_0011_0FBC83FA6F7AEC28"/>
truths, which the nature of the Sabbath, and the im∣portance of the truths themselves clearly demand, your minds are occupied in sensual and worldly con∣cerns—Can GOD be pleased with you, or can it be supposed that you will be gainers by the Gospel? Inattention to the faithful preaching of the Gospel, is in every view totally inexcusable. It is a shame∣ful index of a hard, stupid, and unfeeling heart. The Gospel is of consequence enough to engage atten∣tion, whether we consider it as the only medium of our salvation, or as a source of moral instruction merely; and the motives which are adapted to secure this attention, are certainly numerous and weighty. These motives, however, I shall have occasion by and by to exhibit more fully. I take leave but to observe here, that whatever good individuals may obtain by the preaching of the Gospel, it is impos∣sible that any advantage should be obtained with∣out attention.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE a man comes to the house of GOD, and the most solemn truths are delivered, and in the clearest and most forcible manner—yet if he sleep, or employ his time in gazing on trifling objects, or in studying how he may successfully push his world∣ly schemes—In what respect will he be the wiser or the better? He will go out of the house of GOD as ignorant and as stupid as he came in, and will be more the child of hell than before. <HI>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of GOD.</HI> But how can there be this hearing without serious attention?</P>
<P N="3">3. THE truths of the Gospel should be heard <HI>without prejudice.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="023136_0012_0FBC83FDB3AFC408"/>PREJUDICE has a most pernicious influence in the minds of men: It is like a deep rooted, and incur∣able disease, which resists all applications, and fore∣bodes certain death. When a spirit of prejudice is imbibed, either against truth, against religion in gen∣eral, against a minister, or professors of Christianity; but little good is to be expected from the most dil∣igent labours. There is scarce any thing which more obstructs the genuine progress of the Gospel than this. It renders the subject of it deaf to all rea∣son, to all reproof, and may entirely defeat the most benevolent exertions for his good. Prejudice has fomented enmities, divided churches and societies, made man an enemy to man, and has probably done more towards peopling the world of darkness with wretched inhabitants, than is conceivable. We should therefore make it our great concern, to have all our prejudices mortified; we should be open to conviction; we should be candid, and liberal; ready to yield to the light of truth whenever it is ex∣hibited. For he will be likely to know most, and to judge rightest, whose mind is least under the shac∣kles of prejudice, and whose ingenuous heart is most open to the light of revelation.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE truths which are exhibited in the preach∣ing of the Gospel, ought certainly to be heard, <HI>with∣out a cavilling and captious spirit.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are many people who attend upon the so∣lemnities of publick worship, with scarce any other view than to find fault. They come to the house of GOD, not to honour him, not to seek his favour and learn their duty; but to discover imperfections
<PB N="15" REF="023136_0013_0FBC83FFC0F82B40"/>
in the preacher, in his manner, in his language, or in his doctrines; that they may have the malicious pleasure of railing against him afterwards, and disaf∣fecting others towards him. Is this a proper return for the benevolent exertions of a faithful minister? Is this the spirit, with which we should appear in the sanctuary of the LORD GOD of hosts? Is this the temper, with which the Gospel of the meek SAVIOUR should be heard? What an unamiable disposition of mind is this! What protection can it meet with, my friends, before the bar of that Being, whose solemn requisition is, <HI>Take heed how ye hear</HI>; and who can approve of those only, who, <HI>as new born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby?</HI> And what an effectual barrier must such a spirit be, to preclude all the benign influences of the blessed truths of Christianity! How much more lovely and charming is the temper of that man, who is formed to benevolent propensities, who loves to throw a veil of charity over the defects and undesigned devia∣tions of his minister, and whose ultimate desire is to be made better by the solemn truths he delivers!</P>
<P N="5">5. THE truths of the Gospel should be heard, with a <HI>serious respect to those very truths, and not from an idle unmeaning curiosity, or a chief regard to the manner, lan∣guage, and address of the speaker.</HI></P>
<P>WE come not to the house of GOD, that is, if we come rightly, to see new things, or to gratify a tri∣fling spirit. We come not to the temple of the LORD, as many go to a concert or theatre, to have the ear pleased with musick, the flowing ease of language, or the graces of oratory. And to gratify people in
<PB N="16" REF="023136_0014_0FBC84012F112DD8"/>
their undue thirst for these objects, can never be so∣licitously sought by that minister, who considers that he is speaking for GOD, and that the eternal life or death of his hearers is, as it were, suspended on every word he utters. It will be rather his concern, faith∣fully to declare the whole counsel of GOD, and to win souls to CHRIST. And those people only will hear in a right and profitable manner, who chiefly regard the <HI>truth,</HI> who have consciences open to conviction, and who realize that the Gospel contains an infinitely mo∣mentous address to them from the King of Heaven, and that if they receive it not, it will be but a savour of death unto death to them.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE Gospel should be heard <HI>with prayerfulness.</HI></P>
<P>MINISTERS are but humble instruments in the ac∣complishment of the designs of grace. <HI>Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but GOD that giveth the increase.</HI> As with respect to our existence, <HI>in him we live, and move, and have our beings</HI>; so with respect to every moral good exercise of heart, <HI>he worketh in us, both to will and to do, of his good pleas∣ure.</HI> On the favourable gales, and friendly influ∣ences of his spirit, are we dependent, so that with∣out them the Gospel will be preached absolutely in vain. This dependence we should feel, and relying on the ability, the inexhaustible fulness, and unmerit∣ed mercy of GOD, through JESUS CHRIT, we should come to him as children to a father; soliciting the grateful breathings of his SPIRIT, and his particular blessing on his own institutions. <HI>Let us therefore,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of
<PB N="17" REF="023136_0015_0FBC8402DEF58980"/>
need.</HI> Blessed privilege! O that we knew the sweets of it, by a more general and constant experience! Were there more prayers in the morning of the LORD's day; were there more in the evening; were there more ejaculatory desires offered up in the course of publick worship; did we know more gen∣erally, in what a devout communion with GOD con∣sists; divine truths would undoubtedly have a more extensive, and blessed influence. Then, in the lan∣guage of the Psalmist, <HI>the righteous would flourish like the palm tree, he would grow like a cedar in Lebanon.</HI> Thrice happy that man who walks with GOD, and while he is hearing divine truths dispensed, lifts the pious desires of his soul to him, that those truths may sink deep into his heart, and be a mean of his conformity to his Maker.</P>
<P N="7">7. IF we would comply with the direction of CHRIST, in our manner of hearing the weighty truths of his Gospel, we must hear them <HI>with a disposition, and readiness to obey them in our practice.</HI> Faith must be attended with the external testimony of good works. Theory is of little use without practice. The more we become acquainted with the character of GOD, the greater are our obligations to love it, and to exhibit the fruit of such a love, the purity of a holy conduct. The end of studying the Gospel and its precepts, is, that we may rejoice in the one, and fulfil the other.</P>
<P N="8">8. THE Gospel should be heard <HI>as a message from GOD, and not from men.</HI> It is a revelation from GOD, and contains the best news that were ever published to the universe. It is to be heard therefore as the
<PB N="18" REF="023136_0016_0FBC8405E53C93D8"/>
word of GOD, and not as the word of men. It be∣hoves us to give heed to it, as a proclamation from Heaven, announcing terms of peace to rebellious creatures; on the improvement of which depends our eternal well being. It is to be attended to, not as the dream of an enthusiast, or a compilation of fabulous legends, but as the unalterable word of the immuta∣ble GOD. This invests it with a solemnity which de∣mands the deepest regard—which requires us to yield up our understandings to its instructions with implicit faith; and did we attend to it duly under this consid∣eration, every sentiment would come to us with irre∣sistible weight, and it would be impossible for us to be easy while disobedient to its requirements.</P>
<P N="9">9. THE preaching of the Gospel should be heard <HI>under a sense of the uncertainty of its enjoyment.</HI></P>
<P>OPPORTUNITY to attend to the overtures of re∣deeming grace is a precarious privilege. The means of spiritual improvement may be shortly taken from us, and the things which relate to our everlast∣ing peace, may be soon hid from our eyes. We are sliding with rapidity, on the tide of time, into the boundless ocean of eternity. Very soon our seats in the house of GOD will be vacant, or be filled by others. The Gospel, as to us, will be published no more, and all opportunity for gaining instruction unto salvation will be lost forever. How serious and solicitous should this consideration make us in our attention to the glorious Gospel of CHRIST; es∣pecially since it must be eventually a savour of life unto life or of death unto death to us!—Which brings me to observe,</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="023136_0017_0FBC840735A36E18"/><HI>Finally,</HI> THAT we ought by all means to hear the Gospel, not only as dying, but as <HI>accountable creatures.</HI></P>
<P>OUR accountableness at the bar of GOD should stimulate us to the greatest circumspection and dil∣igence in every duty. The declarations of the Holy Scripture on this subject are delivered in such solemn language as this—<HI>Wo unto thee, Chorazin, wo unto thee, Bethsaida; for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say un∣to you, that it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, at the day of judgment, than for you. Whosoever hath, to him shall be given; but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken, even that which he seemeth to have. He that despised Moses' law, died without mercy under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the SON of GOD, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the SPIRIT of grace.</HI> What can be more solemn than these declarations! To what an infinitely awful and interesting scene do they point us! As stewards, we are to remember that we are to be responsible for our spiritual privi∣leges, at the tribunal of the great GOD. Solemn in∣quiry will be made whether we have listened duly to the proclamations of his grace. At that period of grand assize, when the intelligent universe shall be assembled before the SUPREME JUDGE, to sustain their respective irreversible allotments, we shall be weigh∣ed in the balance of divine truth, and find, to our eternal joy or sorrow, that nothing is more impor∣tant
<PB N="20" REF="023136_0018_0FBC8408DC13A328"/>
than a due hearing of the truths of Christianity, Now under the influence of these vast and weighty ideas, we should hear the Gospel, and certainly if we do, our attention will be very serious.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE third particular which was to engage our attention, you recollect was, The importance of hearing the Gospel in a right manner.</P>
<P>THIS part of our subject I have in a measure una∣voidably anticipated, in what has been already said; but you will suffer me to make some enlargement.</P>
<P>A SUITABLE hearing of the Gospel of the blessed JESUS, is of great importance, because it must conduce in the highest degree to our reputation and usefulness. The knowledge of the sublime truths, and great du∣ties of religion, connected with their sanctifying in∣fluence on the heart, will go far towards furnishing a man for the discharge of the various duties of life with honour to himself, and extensive advantage to others. This will qualify him to contribute essen∣tially to the good of his fellow creatures, in different capacities and relations. It is this, more than any one thing, which forms the good statesman, the up∣right patriot, the charitable benefactor, the constant friend, the amiable spiritual instructor, the firm sup∣porter of the truth, the kind neighbour, the humane master, and the tender relative. He who hears properly, who imbibes and practises, the essential principles of Christianity, is a pillar of society and an ornament of his generation. He goes about, in imitation of his Divine Master, doing good. He wipes the tear from affliction's eye. He espouses the interests of publick and private happiness. His
<PB N="21" REF="023136_0019_0FBC840A320B10D0"/>
prayers draw down blessings upon a guilty world. He lives revered, and when he dies, society feels the shock, and the blessings of many come upon him. Farther,</P>
<P>TO hear the Gospel rightly is of the highest im∣portance to the happiness of the present life. <HI>The ways of wisdom are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. Great peace,</HI> says the Psalmist, <HI>have they who love thy law, and nothing shall offend them.</HI> The man who has heard the Gospel in the love of it, who has made it his object to learn and to fulfil his duty, who has been careful to treat the solemnities of Rev∣elation with that deference and attention which they claim, is happy. He is happy in that he has a sys∣tem of faith on which he leans, and which will not admit of his being driven about by every wind of doctrine. He is not easily turned aside from the foundations of his hope, or the comforts of it, by the glooms of melancholy, the cavils of the sceptick, or the jeers of the scoffer. He is happy in that he is prepared to sustain the calamities of life with forti∣tude and serenity. His principles, views, affections and hopes disarm adversity of its sting, and furnish him with those consolations, which are more than a counterbalance to the severest stroke of affliction. Which leads me to observe, that he is more especial∣ly happy in his devotional exercises. Heaven is shed into his bosom. He has anticipations of fu∣ture blessedness which are not to be conceived by natural men. His own experience teaches him, that <HI>the kingdom of GOD is not meat and drink, but right∣eousness, and peace, and joy in the HOLY GHOST.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="023136_0020_0FBC840C21B787E0"/>LET us now for a moment look at a character the reverse of this. Consider him as born in a christian land, taught to read his Bible from his childhood, and led, in compliance with education and habit, to attend generally on the publick worship of the Sab∣bath; but he has never read the Scriptures with an interested attention and evangelical spirit. His heart has still remained hard, stupid, and uninfluenced by religion. Though he is present statedly in the house of GOD, he is trifling and inattentive. His mind is buried in worldly concerns. Or if in a measure ex∣ternally attentive, some darling prejudice perhaps has made him deaf to every rational sentiment, and to all the remonstrances of truth. He has made no serious inquiries into his own personal state, or fu∣ture prospects; and having no relish for spiritual ob∣jects, he is a stranger to the sincere devotional effu∣sions of the humble heart. Such is the character of one who hears the Gospel carelessly. He is in a christless, spiritually dead state. The consequence is, he is almost as ignorant as a heathen of the great principles and glorious scheme of Revelation; and is of course liable to become a prey to every de∣lusion. He is neither furnished, nor disposed to communicate instruction to his household, nor to ben∣efit his neighbours in their most important concerns. While he is exposed with others to disappointments, distresses and crosses; this peculiar infelicity attends him, that he is not armed against them. His con∣versation is not improving. It savours not of Heav∣en, but of present and sensual things. His example is poisonous. Death is his terror. In short, he has a bare existence, without solid enjoyment.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="023136_0021_0FBC840D2DD0DDD8"/>BUT the importance of hearing the Gospel rightly rises, and appears to be infinitely great, as it respects our eternal welfare. Here the vastness of the sub∣ject eludes our conceptions. On this are suspended the amazing decisions of the future world. Though we are by nature and practice sinners, and condemn∣ed by the laws of GOD to endless woe; we are not left in absolutely hopeless circumstances. A SAV∣IOUR is provided, and offered to us; pardon is pro∣claimed in his name to the penitent and believing. The declaration is made, <HI>Today if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts</HI>; and we are assured that <HI>there is no other name under heaven given amongst men whereby we can be saved</HI>; and that <HI>he who believ∣eth and is baptized shall be saved</HI>; and that <HI>he who believeth not shall be damned.</HI> The present is a state of probation. At death it is closed. The allot∣ments beyond it are retributive, fixed, and irreversi∣ble. If we hear the Gospel rightly, receive with cor∣diality its gracious overtures, become the subjects of the genuine spirit of Christianity, and the true follow∣ers of the LAMB, the Gospel will operate as a sa∣vour of life unto life to us. Its promises will be ours. We shall die in peace. <HI>This corruptible will put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality.</HI>— Through the gloomy valley of the shadow of death, the divine presence will irradiate our way, and we shall be brought to the <HI>general assembly and church of the firstborn, to</HI> JESUS <HI>the mediator of the new covenant, and to an innumerable company of angels.</HI> We shall be embosomed in the embraces of Almighty Love, and shall be making progress in knowledge, in dig∣nity and happiness, to all eternity. On the other

hand; if we wear away this probationary state, as forgetful hearers and not doers of the word; if we are stony ground hearers; if we neglect the great salvation; and live in the ungrateful rejection of GOD's unspeakable gift, our death will be dreadful, and our eternity wretched. Our doom will be pro∣nounced by the lips of JESUS himself, <HI>Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his an∣gels.</HI> We shall be excluded from the society, the peace, and bliss of Heaven. Hope will be extinguished in our bosoms, and leave them to be the mansions of despair. Never more shall we hear the invitations of the Gos∣pel, or have opportunity to believe unto salvation. Our residence must be, in the lake of fire and brim∣stone. Our associates apostate and malicious spirits. For <HI>without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie.</HI> Our consolations will be the gnawings of that worm which never dies. Such is the portion of those who forget GOD. <HI>This shall they have at mine hand, saith the LORD, they shall lie down in sorrow.</HI> This, my hearers, will be our inevitable doom, if we listen not to the pacifick terms of grace in the Gospel, if we continue barren figtrees in the vine∣yard of GOD, if we do not take heed how we hear. And it ought to be observed, and I pray that we may deeply realize the truth, that our punishment will be aggravatedly intense, in proportion to the privileges which we enjoy. Our misery will be more intolerable than heathens, who have no Gospel to account for. Their treatment at the hands of their Judge, will be far more lenient, their doom will be far less deplorable, than what those of us will

experience, who have had the Bible in our hands, and been favoured with the publication of its glorious truths, from Sabbath to Sabbath, and yet have reject∣ed them. GOD will not see his SON slighted, and yet hold his despisers guiltless. He cannot be an indiffer∣ent spectator of ungrateful abuses of his grace. And by how much he loves his only begotten SON, by so much will he make the contemner of him feel the weight of his displeasure. Now the only way to shun this immense misery on the one hand; and to secure the enjoyments of heaven on the other, is to hear the Gospel of the SON of GOD <HI>rightly.</HI> We must treasure up the truth into good and honest hearts, receive it in the love of it, hear as accountable creatures, and with that serious and practical diligence, which become such solemn realities. This is the great thing which we need as immortal creatures. Many other things may be of advantage to us in this world, but nothing else will do for the other. Learning, extensive knowledge in different branches of human science, may make us respectable in the sight of men; but without the genuine influence of religion, we shall be odious in the sight of GOD. Skill in trade may facilitate your worldly advancement, and furnish you with the means of figure, and grandeur; but it can never save you from hell, or put you into heaven. Ingenuity in the mechanick arts, may make your circumstances comfortable in this world; but can never make your circumstances comfortable in eter∣nity. Diligence and prudence in husbandry, may fill your stores and your barns with valuable com∣modities; but can never insure you a treasure in heaven. By learning, skill and industry, we may ar∣rive
<PB N="26" REF="023136_0024_0FBC8413FB4504F8"/>
to worldly opulence and honour, and yet at the summons of mortality sink deeper than Judas in the dungeon of darkness. A king may today wield the sceptre of extensive dominion, and flourish with all the splendor of an eastern monarch; yet, if he neglects duly to hear the Gospel of the SON of GOD, and disregards its gracious proposals, tomorrow he may be the most abject, and wretched creature im∣aginable.</P>
<P>OF how much consequence then our present use∣fulness and happiness may be supposed to be; of how much our interests in a future and retributive state; of so much importance it is, that we hear the great truths of the Gospel in a right and acceptable manner.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. FROM the preceding observations, we may as∣sign the reason why preaching does no more good among mankind in general. It is very obvious that if the truths of the Gospel were clearly, faithfully, and forcibly delivered; and if they were heard with that cordiality, candour, prayerfulness, and serious∣ness, to which they are entitled, the most blessed ef∣fects would be produced. Religion would be the cement of society, and the stability of the times. Hypocrisy would be extirpated from churches. Ig∣norance and stupidity would be banished. The light of the Gospel would break forth as the morn∣ing, and the salvation which it proclaims, would wear a brightness like a lamp that burneth. B<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> now, religion is contemned, and eternity forgotten. Wick∣edness of every kind, profanity, irreligion, debauch∣ery,
<PB N="27" REF="023136_0025_0FBC841768DE1110"/>
fraud and falsehood, reign triumphant. Genuine Christianity has but few adherents; and even those who profess to love CHRIST, at least many of them, seem ashamed of his cause, and act as though they really thought him unworthy of their obedience. What can be the reason of this? Certainly a prin∣cipal one is, that the great truths of the Gospel are not generally preached with that clearness, fidelity, and fervour; and are not heard with that cordiality, attention, candour, and prayerfulness, to which they are entitled.</P>
<P N="1">1. SUCH being the Gospel when properly exhibit∣ed, the manner in which it is to be heard, and the unspeakable importance of hearing it rightly, we can scarcely fail of feeling our absolute need of a super∣natural agency and blessing. As preachers, and as hearers, we may alike exclaim, <HI>Who is sufficient for these things! Without divine strength we can do nothing.</HI> If we are left to ourselves we shall, not∣withstanding the fulness and glory of the Gospel, and the frequent publication of it, treasure up to ourselves wrath, against the day of wrath, and the revelation of the righteous judgment of GOD. On our knees then let us daily fall; and as dependent, polluted creatures, humbly implore the blessing of GOD, the guidance of the HOLY SPIRIT, and grace to help in every time of need.</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM the preceding discourse we may infer, that the duties which are incumbent on a minister and people respecting the Gospel, are the most sol∣emn and weighty that belong to man. It is his province to watch for souls as one who must give
<PB N="28" REF="023136_0026_0FBC84193A3D4188"/>
account. It behoves him at his eternal peril to warn every man, to declare the whole counsel of GOD, and to endeavour by every possible mean to be instru∣mental in the progress of the REDEEMER's kingdom, and the salvation of precious souls. He must not be intimidated from the faithful prosecution of his duty, by the malice or the ridicule of men. Persecution he must patiently encounter, in whatever shape it may meet him. Truths which are grating to the proud hearts of sinners, he must not suppress, lest they should give disgust. But he must be faithful to GOD, and to his own conscience, and cheerfully risque the consequence. On the other hand, people, to whom the truths of the Gospel are addressed, are bound to <HI>take heed how they hear,</HI> to <HI>receive the truth in the love of it,</HI> to practise it, to feel its importance, and to act from the influence of it. They are bound to hear as under the inspection of their Judge, and as hastening on the swift wings of time to his bar; always remembering, that the rule of judgment, re∣specting the Gospel, is to be, <HI>whosoever hath, to him shall be given; but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken, even that which he seemeth to have.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. SUFFER me now, my brethren and friends, to call into view our personal concern in this subject, especially with respect to the relation which has re∣cently been formed between us. In the distribu∣tions of GOD's holy providence, I am now establish∣ed your minister. This to me is a concern of in∣finite moment. Death is before me, and the awful, the grand, the all interesting solemnities of a judg∣ment to come, are soon to be realized. The charge
<PB N="29" REF="023136_0027_0FBC841AB16CD500"/>
which I have received to watch over your souls as one who must give account, lies heavy on my heart. The loss of a soul how, fearful! What! an immor∣tal spirit wading through seas of anguish, sustaining a punishment without diminution or end! And shall that soul be lost through any carelessness, stupidity or unfaithfulness of mine! May divine grace keep me from such an unspeakable infelicity. I desire to be faithful, to declare to you the whole counsel of GOD, though I should provoke your displeasure, and de∣stroy my own temporal ease. I come to you, my dear friends, as far as I know my own heart, not seeking yours but you; and I trust I shall aim at your best good, though the more I love you, the less I be loved. Could I be instrumental in your eternal happiness, I should count no trials too great in the pursuit of so dear an object. From the ex∣perience I have had of the difficulties attending the faithful discharge of the duties of the ministry, I do not allow myself to look forward into future life, with any great expectations of temporal prosperity, or hap∣piness. But it is of very little consequence what be∣fals me, if you, my dear friends, may but be saved; and that you may indeed be saved, I hope will be the drift of my prayers, my exertions, my preaching, and my whole course of life. I trust I shall have your prayers, your friendship, your kindness. I find in my heart that I love you, and unless I be deceived, I shall love you till my last breath. My time in this world will probably be short. May it be filled up with the most diligent exertions for your good. As I am brought into a near and tender relation to you, I shall enter into all your afflictions, your distresses,
<PB N="30" REF="023136_0028_0FBC841C44BC6318"/>
and your spiritual wants. May we live together in love, may we walk together in christian duty, and at last meet in the bosom of JESUS. I wish you to use freedom with me, with my house and family, in neighbourly intercourse; and should any of you have any distresses of mind, should you hereafter feel the want of a christian instructor and guide, when sunk under spiritual burdens, come to me freely as to a brother, and let me endeavour to be an instrument of your happiness. If I declare to you, at any time, truths which are grating to your natural feelings, re∣member it is because I would not flatter you at your eternal expense, but would approve myself to GOD a faithful minister of the New Testament. And inas∣much as some intricate doctrines must be preached and explained, and the manner of treating them may be misunderstood, whenever persons are dissatis∣fied and feel an opposition to them prevailing in their minds, I request that they would be so ingenuous as to converse familiarly with me on their difficulties, that I may have a fair opportunity to remove them, that so that harmony which is the only basis of hap∣py society may be secured.</P>
<P>ON your part, my brethren, you see your duty. Obey then the injunction, <HI>Take heed how ye hear.</HI> Hear with honest, good, and believing hearts. Hear with solemn and serious attention. Hear without prejudice. Hear without a captious and cavilling spirit. Hear from an interested respect to the truths of the Gospel; and not from an idle curiosity, or a chief regard to the manner, language, and ad∣dress of the speaker. Hear with prayerfulness. Hear
<PB N="31" REF="023136_0029_0FBC841FDA70D068"/>
with a disposition and readiness to obey in your uniform practice. Hear the Gospel as the word of GOD, and not as the word of men. Hear under a sense of the uncertainty of its enjoyment. And hear as creatures who are to give account at the last great day, and whose eternal state is to be determined by their reception or rejection of the Gospel. Let me be encouraged by your strict and conscientious at∣tendance on the publick exercises of the LORD's house. Do not suffer yourselves to fall into habits of sloth and tarrying at home on the Sabbath. Let me, I entreat you, be favoured with a solemn attention to the truths I am called to deliver. Let every one remember that he must give an account for the manner in which he treats the Gospel. Deeply re∣alize that if you neglect the great salvation which it proposes; if you fail to hear rightly its interesting truths; if you manifest an indifference and disrespect to the proclamations of redeeming grace, and refuse a compliance with them; destruction will most as∣suredly overtake you as an armed man, and there will be no escape. Lay feelingly to heart the aggra∣vated guilt, which must attend a voluntary, and ha∣bitual abuse, of that exhibition of almighty love which is addressed to you in the Gospel. Consider what anguish will penetrate your souls at the day of judgment, if you are unhappily found to have re∣ceived this grace of GOD in vain. Remember that if ye believe not, still <HI>GOD abideth faithful; he cannot deny himself.</HI> The Eternal Word, found in the form of a servant, addressing sinners, by the ministers of his kingdom, with the endearing persuasions of suf∣fering love, cannot be disregarded with impunity.
<PB N="32" REF="023136_0030_0FBC842174A441E0"/>
Consider also the present felicity, and the intermina∣ble future glory, which are annexed, by divine prom∣ise, to a due hearing, to a cordial admission of the Gospel. Welcome then, I entreat you, its instruc∣tions, and let them have control over all your views, feelings, and conduct. Let your ears, your under∣standings, your hearts be open to the reception of the truth as it is in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Take heed that ye do not bring on yourselves the reproof and sentence, dictated by the HOLY GHOST, <HI>For that they hated knowl∣edge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD; they would none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof: There∣fore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</HI> May you all, of ev∣ery age and description, experience the divine benedic∣tion, and hear, and feel, and act under the guidance of the HOLY SPIRIT. And may <HI>the GOD of peace, who brought again from the dead our LORD JESUS CHRIST, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you all perfect in every good work to do his will; working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through JESUS CHRIST; to whom be glory forever and ever.</HI></P>
