<HEAD>A <HI>LETTER</HI> from a Clergy-man in the Country, To a Clergy-man in the City, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Reverend Brother,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE long Knowledge I have had of your Wisdom, Temper and Moderation (for which I can truly say, without the least Umbrage of Flattery, you deserve to be highly valued) hath given me Encouragement to Communicate to you, my free and impartial Thoughts, concerning the Controversie, between some of our <HI>Brethren</HI> on the one hand, and the <HI>Quakers</HI> on the other. Tho' I am a great Admirer of Solitude and Retirement, being seldom seen in the Crowds of the Talkative and Unthinking Multitude, but sequestring my self, as much as I can possibly, from publick Noise, that I might have the more Opportunity to Introvert my Mind, and Wait upon, and adore my Creator; for when my Mind is <HI>Silent</HI> and <HI>Retired,</HI> and my own Imaginations and Reasonings are shut out; then I can hear his <HI>Still</HI> and <HI>Small Voice,</HI> and have an in∣ward sensible Perception of his Divine Presence with my Soul: Yet I am not such an absolute <HI>Recluse,</HI> as to Cloyster my self wholly up from the Things of this World; for I admit of Visits from particular Friends, read Books at seasonable Intervals, and hold Epistolary Correspondence with Your self, and a few more <HI>Select Persons,</HI> who know the worth of <HI>Privacy,</HI> by the <HI>Benefit</HI> they Enjoy in it. So that tho' I am no Actor in the publick Theatre of the Times, yet I never have been, nor am an ignorant and unconcerned Spectator of those Transactions, that have happened in our Day.</P>
<P>And of all Occurences; the <HI>Dissentions about Religion,</HI> and those often attended with violent He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts and Reflections, by Men of se∣rious and intemperate Spirits, have most affected me. All profess themselves to be Christians, to be Disciples and Followers of Christ, and yet, how few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mitate him whom they pretend to be their Master? And 'tis a sad, but a true Observation, that they who have the worst Cause, and weakest Arguments, are very apt to give Hard Names, and to Revile and Slander their Opponents; that since they cannot Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> them by Dint of fair Ratiocination, they might, if possible, Pollute them with the Dirt of filthy Reflection.
<PB N="4" REF="001055_0003_0FAEF36F85134930"/>
You know whose Practice this has been in their former Quarrels, with other <HI>Dissenters</HI>; and now, in a more particular manner, with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> especially since Mr. <HI>Bugg</HI> and Mr. <HI>Keith</HI> came amongst us; Persons who were not so much <HI>Deserters,</HI> as <HI>Cashired</HI> Men, for their Immoralities; for they did not <HI>Come,</HI> but were <HI>Thrust out</HI> from amongst the <HI>Quakers</HI>; at which taking deep Resentment, and cherishing that bad Humour in themselves, which caused their <HI>Expulsion,</HI> their whole Mass seems to be so corrupted, that their En∣mity is become Implacable against that <HI>People.</HI></P>
<P>And as it is natural for Malignant Humours to spread, especially over those Parts which were before Infected; so these Men, coming full amongst us, of Envy, Hatred and Malice, have infused their Wenom, into some of our <HI>Brethren,</HI> who had formerly been Tainted, and those, having received the Infection themselves, how Industri∣ously do they endeavour to spread it among others.</P>
<P>I am heartily sorry to see it; but what Pains do they take? Yea what Artifices do they use, to possess not only private Persons with Prejudice, but also to stir up Persecution in the Government against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as tho' they were not fit to live amongst us? The Pul∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts Ring with Invectives, and the Presses Groan with Abusive Books and Pamphlets against them. The common Charge is, <HI>That they are Guilty of Blasphemy against God, Christ, and the Holy Scriptures</HI>; thus our <HI>Norfolk</HI>-Brethren: Yea, of <HI>Blasphemy and Heresie</HI>; so Mr. <HI>Keith.</HI> But the <HI>Quakers</HI> have Answered those Charges again and again, and Cleared themselves in the Face of God and the World, as appears by their Printed Books and Papers. To be plain; Let any indifferent Man compare their Books with ours, and he will soon see, to whom the Blasphemy and Heresie belong.</P>
<P>You may remember, Sir, what you gave me in your last, as your Opi∣nion about the Cause of our <HI>Brethrens</HI> Out cry against the Quakers, rather than other <HI>Dissenters,</HI> viz. <HI>Their Opposition to Tithes,</HI> which the other generally pay? and your sense was, That if the <HI>Quakers</HI> would comply in that One Thing, the N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of <HI>Blasphemy and Here∣sie</HI> would be no more heard against them: And I am inclined to be∣lieve it, because you know, that <HI>Tithes are the very Pil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars of out Church</HI>; take away them, and the Sumptuous Fabrick quickly fals into a Heap of Rubbish: We cannot Su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t without them, we can not Furn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h our Libraries, not Maintain our Families, without them. 'Tis granted, they are not due to <HI>Us</HI> by Vertue of the <HI>Divine Law,</HI> as they were to the <HI>Levites</HI>; but they are settled upon us by the <HI>Law of the Land</HI>; and so we Claim them, and so we Receive them, and upon no other Foot of Account.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001055_0004_0FAEF371B99F8A88"/>The <HI>Quakers</HI> have said so much against our old Plea, of <HI>Divine Right,</HI> and made it out so fully, and plainly by <HI>Scripture,</HI> that none but some <HI>Zealous Novices,</HI> or <HI>Super annuated bigots,</HI> will now of∣fer to use it; and therefore the <HI>Wise</HI> among us have quitted that Pre∣tence, and do insist only upon a <HI>Right</HI> issuing from <HI>meer</HI> Humane Con∣stitution.</P>
<P>I have diligently looked into the Controversie, that is between our <HI>Brethren</HI> and the <HI>Quakers,</HI> not with a Partial or Captious, but with a Single and Indifferent Eye; and I do not find, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> are either Guilty of those Real Errors that are laid to their Charge; or, that those which our <HI>Brethren</HI> suppose to be Errors, in them, are Er∣rors at all; but are rather Glorious Gospel Truths. I will give some Instances in both.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The <HI>Quakers</HI> are charged, with <HI>Denying the Man Christ Je∣sus</HI>; which were a great Error indeed, were they Guilty of it: but they sufficiently Acquit themselves of this, by confessing expresly to his <HI>Manhood; That he was Conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin</HI> Mary, <HI>Suffered under</HI> Pontius Pilate, <HI>was Crucified, Dead and Baried, Rose again the third Day, and Ascended into Heaven:</HI> So that this Charge is very untruly brought against them. G. <HI>Fox</HI>'s <HI>Journal,</HI> p. 358.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> They are charged, with <HI>Denying the Resurrection of the Body:</HI> But this also is another false Imputation; for they believe the <HI>Resur∣rection</HI> according to Scripture, the one, <HI>from Sin</HI>; the other, <HI>from Death and the Grave, W. Penn</HI>'s <HI>Key,</HI> &amp;c. Perversion 15. Yea, <HI>That the Dead shall be Raised with the</HI> SAME BODIES, <HI>as far as a Natur∣al, and Incorruptible, Terrestrial, and Celestial, can be the</HI> SAME, Truths Principles <HI>by</HI> J. Crook, <HI>printed</HI> Anno 1663.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> They are charged, with <HI>Denying the Trinity:</HI> But the con∣trary is manifest by their Writings; for they believe in the <HI>Holy Three,</HI> or <HI>Trinity</HI> of <HI>Father, Word</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.7. And that these <HI>Three</HI> are truly and properly <HI>One,</HI> of <HI>One Nature,</HI> as well as <HI>Will. W. Penn</HI>'s <HI>Key,</HI> &amp;c. Perversion 9. <HI>In the Unity of the God head,</HI> saith <HI>G. Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tehead, there is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and that those Three are One, of One, Substance, Power and Eternity.</HI> Truth and Innocency Vindicated, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> p. 52. See also <HI>Anguis Flagelea∣tus,</HI> by <HI>Joseph Wyeth.</HI> p. 184.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> Another Charge against them is, that, <HI>They Deny the Scriptu∣res</HI>; than which, nothing can be Falser: For they have always Testi∣fied, as <HI>J. Wyeth</HI> declares, to the 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16 <HI>That all Scripture is given by Inspiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Re∣proof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness,</HI> Ibid. p. 150.
<PB N="6" REF="001055_0005_0FAEF372A4AFDC68"/>
See also, <HI>The Defence of the People called Quakers,</HI> &amp;c. p. 15. The like may be said of several other Things, which are real Errors, where ever they are met with, as well as those before mentioned; but they are untruly charged upon the <HI>Quakers</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it evidently appears by their Writings.</P>
<P>Again, there are some other Things, which our <HI>Brethren</HI> suppo∣sing to be Errors in the <HI>Quakers,</HI> have charged upon them, as such, which yet are found to be Glorious Gospel Truths.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Our <HI>Brethren</HI> suppose that the <HI>Quakers</HI> are in an Error about the LIGHT WITHIN; and thereupon have bestowed upon it many Opprobrious, not to say, Blasphemous Names; as, <HI>Ignis hotuus, A Diabolical Light,</HI> &amp;c. So some: And others, <HI>A Spark from the De∣vil's Forge</HI>; So our <HI>Norfolk</HI> Brethren (to wit) Doctor <HI>Beckham,</HI> Mr. <HI>Meriton,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Topcliffe,</HI> in their <HI>Principles of the Quakers,</HI> &amp;c. p. 6. <HI>A Whimsical Witness fetch'd from</HI> Terra Incognita, p. 57. <HI>A Counterfeit Phantasm,</HI> p. 74. <HI>The Phantasm of a Christ within,</HI> p. 86. <HI>ibid.</HI> Another calls it, <HI>A Monstrous Notion</HI>; and Affirms it to be <HI>the Ground and Foundation of all their other Errors and Blasphemies</HI>: So the Author of <HI>The Snake in the Grass,</HI> 3d Edition, p. 8. But I have faithfully Examin'd the <HI>Quakers</HI> Notion about the LIGHT WITHIN, and compar'd it with the Scriptures, and do find, that they speak of it as the Scriptures do (<HI>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z.</HI>) That <HI>Christ is the</HI> LIGHT <HI>of the World</HI>; and that he doth <HI>Enlighten every Man that cometh into it,</HI> with DI∣VINE SAVING LIGHT. I am sorry our <HI>Brethren</HI> should be so <HI>Dark,</HI> as to oppose it.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly,</HI> Our <HI>Brethren</HI> Charge <HI>Immediate Revelation</HI> upon them, as an∣other great Error; which is not an Error, but a Glorious Gospel Truth: for, if <HI>Immediate Revelation</HI> were Ceased, as our <HI>Brethren</HI> say, there could be no such Thing, as the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> in the World; for there is no Saving Knowledge of the Father and the Son Attainable without it. I have the Testimony of Christ himself, for what I say, and therefore am bold to Assert it. <HI>No Man knoweth the Son, but the Father; Neither knoweth any Man the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will Reveal him,</HI> Mat. 11.27. Take away <HI>Imme∣diate Revelation,</HI> and farewell to the Christian Religion; a <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Notion</HI> of Christianity may be kept up, but the <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> cannot subsist without it.
<Q>The <HI>Quakers</HI> do not plead for any <HI>New Gospel, Faith,</HI> or <HI>Doctrine,</HI> different from that which <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Holy A∣postles</HI> and <HI>Prophets</HI> Taught, and is recorded in the Scriptures of Truth: but for the Revelation of that, which they Taught, &amp; is there in Recorded. <BIBL><HI>Defence of the People called Quakers,</HI> p. 6.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> Our <HI>Brethren</HI> Charge it as an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the <HI>Quakers,</HI> for
<PB N="7" REF="001055_0006_0FAEF37401937140"/>
Asserting the <HI>Sufficiency of the</HI> LIGHT WITHIN <HI>to Salvation, without the Scriptures</HI>: But this is no Error in the <HI>Quakers</HI> Sence; for I per∣ceive by their Writings, that they do not oppose the LIGHT WITH∣IN to the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> nor do they exclude the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> where they are afforded unto Men: but by the LIGHT WITHIN, they under∣standing Christ, who said, <HI>I am the</HI> LIGHT <HI>of the World,</HI> John 9.5. And is <HI>God Blessed for ever.</HI> Rom. 9.5. and therefore able to Save to the uttermost, do Testifie to the <HI>Sufficiency</HI> thereof, to Save all those who believe in and obey it; tho' the <HI>Scriptures</HI> are with-held from them by the <HI>Providence of God.</HI> For, as those that have the Literal Knowledge of the Work of the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> are not Saved <HI>meerly</HI> by that, without the Experimental Knowledge of the Work of the Spirit in, and upon their Hearts; so those that have the Experimental Knowledge, may be Saved without the Literal: And as many are In∣jured by the Fall of the First <HI>Adam,</HI> who know nothing of him, or his Eating of the forbidden Fruit; so, many are made Partakers of the great Salvation, that comes by Jesus Christ, the Second <HI>Adam,</HI> tho' Ignorant of the History of his Sufferings and Death. Therefore, un∣less our <HI>Brethren</HI> will deny the All-sufficiency of Christ, or exclude all those the Pale of divine Mercy, who know not the Scriptures (which is both contrary to <HI>Scripture,</HI> and to the repeated Testimony of God's Goodness Recorded therein) I cannot see what Pretence they can make for Oppugning this Assertion of the <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly,</HI> Another Truth held by this <HI>People,</HI> and mis-called Error by our <HI>Brethren</HI> is, <HI>Sinless Perfection on this Side the Grave:</HI> But if such a State is not attainable in this Life, to what end are there so many <HI>Precepts</HI> about it, so many <HI>Exhortations</HI> to it, so many <HI>Prayers</HI> for it, and so many <HI>Examples</HI> of it recorded in the <HI>Scripture?</HI> Why do we pray in the <HI>Te Deum, Vouchsafe, O Lord, to keep us this day</HI> without Sin? In the 3d Collect, at Morning Prayer; <HI>Grant that this day we fall into</HI> No Sin, <HI>neither run into</HI> Any <HI>kind of Danger; but that</HI> All our doings <HI>may be ordered by thy Governance, to do</HI> Always <HI>that which is Righteous in thy Sight.</HI> In the Litany; <HI>From</HI> All Evil <HI>and Mischief, from Sin, from the Crafts and Assaults of the Devil, from thy Wrath, and from Everlasting Damnation: Good Lord deliver us</HI>!</P>
<P><HI>From Fornication, and</HI> All <HI>other deadly Sin, and from</HI> All <HI>the Deceits of the World, the Flesh, and the Devil, Good Lord deliver us!</HI> In the Collect for <HI>Innocents</HI> Day; <HI>Mortifie and Kill</HI> All <HI>Vices in us.</HI> For the <HI>Circumcision</HI> of Christ; <HI>Grant us the true Circumcision of the Spirit, that our Hearts, and</HI> All <HI>our Members, being mortified from</HI> All <HI>Worldly and Carnal Lusts; we may in</HI> All <HI>Things Obey thy blessed Will.</HI> For the 6th Sunday after <HI>Epiphany; Grant us, we beseech thee, that

having this Hope, we may</HI> Purifie <HI>our selves even as he is</HI> Pure. For the first Sunday in <HI>Lent; Give us Grace to use such Abstinence, that our Flesh being subdued to the Spirit, we may</HI> Ever <HI>Obey thy Godly Motions in Righteousness and true Holiness.</HI> For the first Sunday after <HI>Easter; Grant us so to put away the Leaven of Malice and Wickedness, that we may</HI> Always <HI>Serve thee in</HI> Pureness <HI>of Living and Truth.</HI> For the 7th Sunday after <HI>Trinity; Nourish us with</HI> All <HI>Goodness, and of thy great Mercy keep us in the same.</HI> For the 15th Sunday after <HI>Trinity; Keep us</HI> Ever <HI>by thy Help, from</HI> All <HI>Things Hurtf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, and lead us to</HI> All <HI>Things Profitable to our Salvation.</HI> For the 17th Sunday after <HI>Trini∣ty; Make us</HI> Continually <HI>to be given to</HI> All <HI>good Works.</HI> For the 18th, <HI>ibid; Lord, we beseech thee, grant thy People Grace to withstand the Temptations of the World, the Flesh and the Devil; and with</HI> pure Hearts <HI>and</HI> Minds <HI>to follow thee the Only God:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Here we make the Spirit our Rule and Guide, and yet Quarrel with the Quakers for doing the same</NOTE> So the 19th, <HI>Grant that thy</HI> Holy Spirit <HI>may in</HI> All <HI>Things</HI> Direct <HI>and</HI> R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>our Hearts:</HI> So the 21th, <HI>Grant, we beseech thee, mercifull Lord, to thy faithfull People, Pardon and Peace, that they may be cleansed from</HI> All <HI>their Sins.</HI> See more of the like kind, in the order for the <HI>Administration of the Lord's Supper,</HI> and the <HI>Ministration of Publick Baptism of Infants.</HI> Why, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, do we Pray thus And why do we Teach our Children in the <HI>Church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hism,</HI> to Pray to be <HI>kept from All Sin and Wickedness,</HI> if it be impossible to be obtained?</P>
<P>You know, Sir, That SINLESS PERFECTION <HI>in this L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe,</HI> is the Doctrine both of the Law and the Gospel, the Doctrine of <HI>Moses,</HI> and the Prophets, of Christ and his Apostles: Or <HI>Justin Martyr,</HI> in <HI>quaest &amp; respon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ad Orthodox.</HI> Of <HI>Origen, Hem.</HI> 11. <HI>super Gen.</HI> Of <HI>Cy∣prian, Serm. de Baptism.

<P>First, <HI>That there is a Possibility, through the Grace and Help of Christ, of a Total Mortification of Sin in this Life.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="9" REF="001055_0008_0FAEF374CA2CA128"/>2dly, <HI>Then there is a Possibility of perfect Obedience, through the Grace and help of Christ, to the Law of God in this Life.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, Mr. <HI>Keith</HI> himself, tho' denying SINLESS PERFECTION, as held by the <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet Asserts it in his own Terms, as fully as can be; see the <HI>Account</HI> of an <HI>Occasional Conference</HI> between him and <HI>Thomas Upshare,</HI> p. 15. where he Affirms, <HI>That Persons, by the Help of God's Grace and Spirit continually assisting them, may, before Death, come to</HI> Perfection <HI>in the true sense of Scripture, so as with Sincerity of Heart to Love God, and walk in</HI> All <HI>his Commandments; and to be free from the condemning and commanding Power of Sin; and from</HI> All, <HI>not only Scandalous, but deliberate and wilful Sin, tho' liable to</HI> Sinful Im∣perfections. For, do not the <HI>Quakers</HI> grant, that <HI>there remaineth al∣ways in some part a possibility of Sinning, when the Mind doth not most Diligently and Wachfully Attend unto the Lord?</HI> See <HI>R. Barclay</HI>'s <HI>Apo∣logy,</HI> Prop. 8 So that Mr. <HI>Keith</HI> both Denies and Affirms, SINLESS PERFECTION, in the same Paragraph: For a <HI>Liableness to Sin,</HI> doth no more exclude SINLESS PERFECTION now, than it did to <HI>Adam</HI> before his <HI>Fell</HI>; who, tho' he was liable to <HI>Fall,</HI> yet was <HI>Perfect</HI> before he <HI>Fell:</HI></P>
<P>I could add many more Testimonies in Confirmation of this Doct∣rine, but I fear I should exceed the bounds of an Epistle, and therefore shall draw towards a Conclusion; Humbly advising my <HI>Brethren,</HI> that are to Hot and Violent against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> to Cool a little, &amp; to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate of their Impetuousness.</P>
<P>We profess to be Ministers of Jesus Christ; let us Imitate him in his <HI>Meckness, Lowliness, Gentleness,</HI> and in his <HI>loving</HI> and <HI>peaceable Disposition</HI>; and not Demonstrate to the World, by our contrary Pra∣ctice, that he <HI>never Sent</HI> us. <HI>Moderation,</HI> is a Virtue that will Com∣mend us, not only to our own People, but to those that <HI>Dissent</HI> from us; but Fierceness and Animosity, Strife and Contention, render us Contemptible unto all. If it be possible, as much as in us lies, let us live Peaceably with all Men</P>
<P>My advice is, to put an End to these <HI>Paper Skirmishes,</HI> with these <HI>Sober Peaceable People,</HI> and make <HI>War</HI> against our <HI>Lusts</HI> and <HI>Sins,</HI> of all sorts; this will be the <HI>Noblest Cause</HI> we can Engage in, and the most <HI>Comfortable</HI> and <HI>Glorious of Victories</HI> to obtain it. For how doth <HI>Iniquity abound</HI> among us? Are not <HI>All Orders and Degrees</HI> of Men and Women Infected? May we not All truely say, <HI>We are miserable Offenders, both Priests and People, being full of Wounds, and Bruises putrifying Sores?</HI> What <HI>Atheism</HI> &amp; <HI>Profaneness,</HI> what <HI>Pride</HI> &amp; <HI>Luxury,</HI> what <HI>Lewdness</HI> and <HI>Intemperance,</HI> what <HI>Lying</HI> and <HI>Swearing,</HI> what <HI>Chambering</HI> &amp; <HI>Wantonness,</HI> what <HI>Gaming,</HI> &amp; <HI>Sporting</HI> what <HI>Condeming</HI> &amp;

<HI>Cheating,</HI> what <HI>Injustice</HI> and <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>ion,</HI> over-spread the Nation! We cry, <HI>The Church, The Church,</HI> as some of old did, <HI>The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord, are we,</HI> while Satan hath his Seat amongst us, and we have little left of <HI>Pure</HI> and <HI>Primitive Christianity</HI> in our Communion. We are so degenerated from that <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Po∣wer,</HI> that appeared in our <HI>first Reformers,</HI> that we are become a <HI>Re∣proach</HI> to the <HI>Reformation:</HI> And now we make a great Ostentation of <HI>Essentials and Fundamentals</HI> in words, when we are departed from the <HI>Foundation</HI> in our Practices. It was the Saying of the Primitive Christi∣ans, <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n mag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> eloqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur, sed vivimas,</HI> We do not speak great things, but we live But behold, how notoriously the Apostacy of this Gene∣ration contradicts it! So that we may take up our Lamentation, and say, <HI>Magna eloquimur sed non-vivimus</HI>; Our Impute Conversations, are a Shame to our splendid Professions. The <HI>Quakers,</HI> whom some call, <HI>Hereticks and Blasphemers,</HI> but still <HI>want proof</HI> for those Odious Epithets, are <HI>Sound</HI> and <HI>Orthodox Livers</HI>; you, they not only Out strip us in <HI>Real Piety</HI> and <HI>Vertue,</HI> but in <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Principle</HI> too, and for my part. I do believe, they are the People, whom God hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed up in this Dreggy Age of the World, to Refine it, and Restore talien Christianity to its Primitive State of Perfection and Innocency.</P>
<P>Bold and Angry Mr. <HI>Keith,</HI> write not only at <HI>Random,</HI> but with extream Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulency against them; his C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oler overflows in all his late <HI>Pamphlets,</HI> and almost every Stroke of his Pen discovers either <HI>Gall</HI> of <HI>Blood.</HI> I had been astonished, when I read in his <HI>Reasons for lea∣ving Quaker sin,</HI> p. 32. That <HI>he was able to prove, that they do not be∣lieve one Article of the Apostles Creed:</HI> But that I consider, that when he has a mind, he may say the same of Us, or any other <HI>Christians</HI> in the World; yea, that he himself doth not believe them, and yet wipe, his Mouth, and say, <HI>He is always Sound in Fundamentals:</HI> for he is the <HI>greatest Instance of Confidence and Contradiction</HI> that this Age hath produced. But whom are we to believe, Mutable and Invidious Mr. <HI>Keith,</HI> or the Sober and Peaceable Quakers? A Furious and Implaca∣ble Adversary, or an Honest and Conscientions People? You will ea∣sily agree with me, that the Testimony of the lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> is of most Validi∣ty. Now these People have often declared, <HI>That they do sincerely Believe every Article of the Apostles Creed,</HI> as their Books do Testifie.</P>
<P><HI>Benjamin Coole</HI> speaks exceeding plain and full in this Matter: <HI>To obviate all Objections, as well to man fest the Intolerable Baseness of</HI> George Keith; <HI>I will add,</HI> saith he, <HI>that it is not only All what we</HI> suppose <HI>Truths in the Apostles Creed, that we bel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive, but even all that is</HI> contained <HI>in what is called the Apostles Creed, allowing us but a just and reasonable Explanation in three Particulars, that seem to us not safel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>

<P>'Tis manifest, that M. <HI>Keith</HI> has done this People a great deal of Wrong; for he hath first drawn them in what ugly Colours his Invi∣dious Fancy pleased, and then endeavoured to make us believe, his Monstrous Draught is their Real Picture: whereby he has done much H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t also to many of our own People, instilling into the Minds of the Unwary and Inconsiderate, such strange Notions of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> as tho' they were the <HI>Vilest of Hereticks,</HI> who are the <HI>Purest Part of the Reformation.</HI> For their Principle is Pure and Holy, and their Con∣versation generally such, as becomes the Gospel of Christ, notwith∣standing the Filth cast upon there by M. <HI>Keith</HI> in his <HI>Occasional Consc∣ience</HI> with <HI>Thomas Upshare,</HI> p. 15. The <HI>Sins</HI> there charged, as Drun∣kenness, Whoredom and Defrauding, and many more, being Notori∣ously known to be frequently committed by many, both of our Teachers and People.</P>
<P>I have met with a Passage, which for the suteableness of it to Mr. <HI>Keith</HI>'s Character, and Project against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> I shall here Sub∣joyn, and Conclude.</P>

But his Judges quickly repented themselves of what they had done, and slew many of his Accusers; and some others of them laid Violent Hands u∣pon themselves. And 'tis observed by some <HI>Historians,</HI> That the City of <HI>Athens,</HI> not long after his Death, was punished with such a <HI>Ter∣rible Plague,</HI> that never was amongst them before.</P>
<P>I would have Mr. <HI>Keith,</HI> and those of our <HI>Brethren,</HI> that are so Hot and Furious, consider of this, and be Wise in time: O Let not our <HI>Church</HI> become a <HI>Slaughter House,</HI> nor her <HI>Priests</HI> Instruments to Stirr up <HI>Cruelty</HI> and <HI>Persecution,</HI> against a Quiet and truely Religious People! But let us all Study to promote <HI>Love, Peace, Truth</HI> and <HI>Righteousness,</HI> both by <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Living</HI>; That God may Look down upon us in Mercy, and Stay his Hand, which is Stretched out against us, for the Sins and Transgre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> of our Priests and People.</P>
