<P>THE Words I have chosen at the Head of my Title Page, I am told by a Gentleman skilled in the Indian Languages, is very expres∣sive of a HERO relying on GOD to bless his Endeavours, in protecting what he has put under his Care.</P>
<P>To form some Idea of its Signification, he says, you may imagine a Man, with his Wife, and Children about him, and, with an Air of Resolution, calling out to his Enemy, ALL THESE GOD HAS GIVEN ME, AND I WILL DEFEND THEM.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<L>How <HI>GEORGE,</HI> for to regain his Right,</L>
<L>With <HI>LEWIS</HI> held a dreadful Fight;</L>
<L>In which the Man who rais'd the Strife;</L>
<L>Was vanquished, and lost his Life:</L>
<L>Whereon a warm Dispute arose,</L>
<L>About the legal Use of <HI>BLOWS.</HI></L>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>THERE liv'd a Man not long ago,</L>
<L>And yet may live, for ought I know;</L>
<L>A Patriot hold, of honest Fame,</L>
<L>A <HI>Briton</HI> true, and GEORGE his Name:</L>
<L>His gen'rous Breast contain'd a Heart,</L>
<L>That dar'd to act an honest Part.</L>
<L>He lov'd the Cause of Liberty;</L>
<L>And scorn'd a Life that was not free:</L>
<L>His <HI>Country's Cause</HI> he would defend,</L>
<L>And venture all to serve a Friend.</L>
<L>No Man more bold in Time of Danger;</L>
<L>To <HI>bear,</HI> as well as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> a Stranger.</L>
<L>Thus long our Hero, liv'd at Ease</L>
<L>With all the World, in Love and Peace,</L>
<L>Till LEWIS, whose ambitious Mind,</L>
<L>Nor Law, nor Justice, e'er could bind;</L>
<L>Seiz'd on a Part of GEORGE's Land,</L>
<L>And held Possession, Sword in Hand.</L>
<L>Our Hero, tho' averse to War,</L>
<L>Could not this daring Insult bear,</L>
<L>But soon resolv'd his Foe to fight,</L>
<L>And by the Sword regain his Right.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT, as 'tis very seldom known,</L>
<L>That one Misfortune comes alone,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="007788_0004_102D8B57083EC760"/>So honest GEORGE had scarcely heard,</L>
<L>How he, as to his Land, had far'd,</L>
<L>When, lo! 'twas his unhappy Fate,</L>
<L>To meet another Loss, as great.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For LEWIS, who to gain his End,</L>
<L>Would to the meanest Things descend,</L>
<L>Contriv'd our Warrier's House to rob,</L>
<L>And brib'd a Thief to do the Job.</L>
<L>The Villain follow'd the Direction;</L>
<L>Then fled to LEWIS for Protection;</L>
<L>But first had seiz'd on GEORGE's Money,</L>
<L>And plunder'd him of ev'ry Penny:</L>
<L>Stole every Pistol, Sword and Gun,</L>
<L>That he could lay his Fingers on.</L>
<L>But what chagrin'd our Hero most,</L>
<L>Was, that his trusty Sword was lost.</L>
<L>His Sire, at <HI>Blenbeim,</HI> found it good,</L>
<L>And stain'd it there with <HI>Gallit</HI> Blood;</L>
<L>With it our Warrier gain'd Applause,</L>
<L>At <HI>Culloden,</HI> in BRITAIN's Cause:</L>
<L>This Sword gave GEORGE no little Pain;</L>
<L>But it was stol'n, and Grief was vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THUS <HI>GEORGE,</HI> now in a needful Hour,</L>
<L>Had not a Weapon in his Power;</L>
<L>And what made the Misfortune worse,</L>
<L>Had scarce a Farthing in his Purse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN this sad Case, away he flies,</L>
<L>With all the Warrier in his Eyes,</L>
<L>To SIMON, his Acquaintance, who</L>
<L>Was his fast Friend, and Neighbour too,</L>
<L>To whom he freely did impart,</L>
<L>The Cause of all his present Smart.</L>
<L><HI>Quoth he,</HI> "I'm come upon my Word,</L>
<L>"To borrow Cash, to buy a Sword;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="007788_0005_102D8B58EC347B88"/>"For LEWIS, that perfidious Knave,</L>
<L>"Who fain would all the World enslave,</L>
<L>"Whose restless and ambitious Mind,</L>
<L>"The Laws of Justice cannot bind:</L>
<L>"Has seiz'd my Land, and what is worse,</L>
<L>"Resolves to hold his Claim by Force.</L>
<L>"I therefore am resolv'd to try,</L>
<L>"To have my Land again, or die;</L>
<L>"I'll bring the proud Invader down:</L>
<L>"I know his Strength, and know my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SIMON was of a gen'rous Cast▪</L>
<L>In Friendship, constant to the last▪</L>
<L>He wanted not his Share of Sense,</L>
<L>Nor was averse to Self-Defence;</L>
<L>But durst not own it to the Church,</L>
<L>For fear of eccles'astick Birch.</L>
<L><HI>Quoth</HI> SIMON, "Tis a wretched Case,</L>
<L>"That this Disturber of our Peace,</L>
<L>"Should lord it o'er his Neighbours thus,</L>
<L>"What will at last become of us?</L>
<L>"If he has seiz'd on Land of thine,</L>
<L>"No doubt he soon will seize on mine,</L>
<L>"But GEORGE, thy rash Design forbear,</L>
<L>"And trust to Heav'ns paternal Care;</L>
<L>"Those who for Self-Defence contend,</L>
<L>"Cannot on Providence depend.</L>
<L>"Besides, Defence cannot be right,</L>
<L>"Since Christians are forbid to fight:</L>
<L>"But as thy Money is so scant,</L>
<L>"A little Sum thou shalt not want;</L>
<L>"For to refuse a Friend your Purse,</L>
<L>"Is really mean, or something worse.</L>
<L>"GEORGE, I will lend thee twenty Pieces;</L>
<L>"They'll do thee Service, as thy Case is▪</L>
<L>"Whatever Use thou puts them to,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="007788_0006_102D8B5B5F130848"/>"Is no Concern of mine, to know.</L>
<L>GEORGE understood what SIMON meant;</L>
<L>And bowing-low, away he went,</L>
<L>Revolving in his honest Mind,</L>
<L>The Vice and Follies of Mankind.</L>
<L>SIMON, he saw, us'd all his Art,</L>
<L>To hide the Language of his Heart;</L>
<L>That all he said on Self-Defence,</L>
<L>Was nothing more than meer Pretence:</L>
<L>But as he just had gain'd his Suit,</L>
<L>'Twould be imprudent to dispute.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As happy now, as any Lord,</L>
<L>He with his Money bought a Sword,</L>
<L>And Weapons, such as suits a Knight,</L>
<L>When ready to engage in Fight.</L>
<L>He hourly now impatient grows,</L>
<L>To meet the Foe▪ and come to Blows.</L>
<L>But quite averse to shedding Blood,</L>
<L>Our valiant Warrier held it good,</L>
<L>Rather than try his Right by Force,</L>
<L>To take a more pacific Course:</L>
<L>He therefore sent a trusty Hand,</L>
<L>To let the Tyrant understand,</L>
<L>That tho' he was for Fight prepar'd,</L>
<L>And from the Combat nothing fear'd;</L>
<L>Yet, as he was inclin'd to Peace,</L>
<L>He freely would submit his Case,</L>
<L>For to be try'd at Reason's Bar,</L>
<L>And would abide the Judgment there.</L>
<L>But LEWIS of his Prowess vain,</L>
<L>Treated this Message with Disdain.</L>
<L>"Go back, <HI>Quoth he,</HI> and tell your Lord,</L>
<L>"That I try Titles by the Sword;</L>
<L>"It is the shortest Way by far,</L>
<L>"And less expensive than the Bar;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="007788_0007_102D8B5D4EB22D30"/>"And 'tis the Way that I intend,</L>
<L>"To bring our Quarrel to an End:</L>
<L>"Let's fight it fairly, Hand to Hand,</L>
<L>"And the Survivor take the Land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When GEORGE this Message had receiv'd,</L>
<L><HI>Quoth he,</HI> "If I am not deceiv'd,</L>
<L>"This Boaster, when too late, may find</L>
<L>"Himself much more to Peace inclin'd,</L>
<L>"And wish, in vain, that he had clos'd,</L>
<L>"With the fair Offer I propos'd.</L>
<L>"This Message take him instantly:</L>
<L>"Tell the perfidious Man from me,</L>
<L>"That all his Threats I hold in scorn,</L>
<L>"And will attend To-morrow Morn,</L>
<L>"At Dawn of Day, and in the Field,</L>
<L>"He has by Force unjustly held."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NO sooner had the King of Day,</L>
<L>Bedeck'd the Eastern Sky with grey,</L>
<L>When both the Champions well prepar'd,</L>
<L>In the decisive Field appear'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Quoth</HI> GEORGE, "I joy to meet you here;</L>
<L>"Now to defend yourself prepare."</L>
<L>LEWIS return'd, "Yourself defend,</L>
<L>"Your Life, or mine, the Strife must end"</L>
<L>This said they instantly engage,</L>
<L>With manly Strength, and martial Rage,</L>
<L>A bloody Combat long they held,</L>
<L>Each Side unknowing how to yield.</L>
<L>They sought as brave, some Authors tell us,</L>
<L>As did fam'd <HI>Hector</HI> and <HI>Achilles;</HI></L>
<L>And asking both these Heroes Pardon,</L>
<L>They laid each other full as hard on.</L>
<L>At length our Warrier fill'd with Shame,</L>
<L>Unto a close Engagement came,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="007788_0008_102D8B5F46B81F90"/>And soon let LEWIS understand,</L>
<L>What 'twas to fight him Hand to Hand.</L>
<L>For, now, alas! the Crimson Tide,</L>
<L>Flow'd freely from the Aggressor's Side;</L>
<L>And tho' he scarce his Sword could wield,</L>
<L>His Pride forbad his Heart to yield.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When GEORGE perceiving his Distress,</L>
<L>His haughty Foe did thus address:</L>
<L>"LEWIS, <HI>Quoth he,</HI> let's end the Strife;</L>
<L>"Restore my Land, and take thy Life."</L>
<L><HI>Quoth</HI> LEWIS; "Know, that still I live,</L>
<L>"And scorn the Life that thou can'st give.</L>
<L>"No; one of us must die this Day,</L>
<L>"For Death alone shall end the Fray.</L>
<L>Thus he; when at our Warrier's Head,</L>
<L>With both his Hands a Blow he made;</L>
<L>But GEORGE, who kept a watchful Eye,</L>
<L>Perceiv'd the Stroke, and put it by,</L>
<L>And at this Usage quite enrag'd,</L>
<L>His Foe with double Force engag'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW LEWIS, when it was too late,</L>
<L>Saw plainly his approaching Fate;</L>
<L>Yet, dauntless, bravely play'd his Part,</L>
<L>'Till GEORGE's Sword had pierc'd his Heart</L>
<L>At which he fell; and falling, cry'd,</L>
<L>MY PUNISHMENT IS JUST; and dy'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW from the Multitude around,</L>
<L>Loud Acclamations shake the Ground;</L>
<L><HI>Crying,</HI> Now all our Fears are fled,</L>
<L>For, lo! the lawless Tyrant's dead;</L>
<L>May Heaven its choicest Gifts bestow,</L>
<L>Upon the Man that gave the Blow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>GEORGE, now all Tenderness appears;</L>
<L>Nor could he stop the flowing Tears</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="007788_0009_102D8B6189DA4338"/>But stood▪ revolving in his Mind,</L>
<L>The various Follies of Mankind,</L>
<L>Then on the Dead he cast his Eye,</L>
<L>And thus addressed the Standers by:</L>
<L>"I'm griev'd, <HI>said he,</HI> that one so brave,</L>
<L>"Should thus untimely fill the Grave:</L>
<L>"But when at Truth Men shut their Eyes,</L>
<L>"And Reason's sacred Laws despise,</L>
<L>"Will make their vicious Wills their Law,</L>
<L>"And keep by Force the World in awe,</L>
<L>"Rob us of Freedom, Life and Treasure,</L>
<L>"And tell us, 'tis their Will and Pleasure;</L>
<L>"Then the Oppress'd should have Recourse</L>
<L>"To Arms, and right themselves by Force:</L>
<L>"And he that will his Freedom lose,</L>
<L>"Rather than Force with Force oppose,</L>
<L>"Let crazy Heads say all they can,</L>
<L>"Does not deserve the Name of Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NOW swift as Light'ning thro' the Skies,</L>
<L>The News of GEORGE's Conquest flies,</L>
<L>And quickly reaching SIMON's Ears,</L>
<L>It dissipated all his Fears:</L>
<L>For now he thought himself secure,</L>
<L>Since haughty LEWIS was no more.</L>
<L>Qouth he, "I'm glad that Neighbour GEORGE,</L>
<L>"Has been to Wickedness a Scourge;</L>
<L>"And tho' Defence at any Time,</L>
<L>"The Faithful hold to be a Crime;</L>
<L>"Yet GEORGE, by Force, we must confess,</L>
<L>"Has freed his Neighbours from Distress;</L>
<L>"Has sav'd their Lives and Liberties,</L>
<L>"And set their aching Hearts at Ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHILST SIMON thus, from Truth had swerv'd,</L>
<L>NATHAN stood by him unobserv'd.</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="007788_0010_102D8B631B936320"/>NATHAN, as some are pleas'd to say,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> honest in his Way;</L>
<L>He understood as well as any,</L>
<L>To make Advantage of a Penny:</L>
<L>His Countenance was as demure,</L>
<L>As <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the PHIZ of SIMON PURE.</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>on Defence,</HI> he had read o'er,</L>
<L>With many a pious Author more,</L>
<L>Who with enthusiastick Din,</L>
<L>Make <HI>Self-Defence</HI> a deadly Sin.</L>
<L>His Liberty and Life he'd lose,</L>
<L>Rather than Force with Force oppose,</L>
<L>Nor yet resist in any wise,</L>
<L>Were Heaven itself to be the Prize.</L>
<L>Yet if a Thief his Mansion breaks,</L>
<L>And from him the least Trifle takes,</L>
<L>The Fugitive he will pursue;</L>
<L>Bind him by Force, and hang him too.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THIS Bigot knew well what had past,</L>
<L>'Twixt GEORGE and SIMON, first and last;</L>
<L>And like himself, had lost no Time,</L>
<L>To tell the Church the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Crime:</L>
<L>And as she knew his Disposition,</L>
<L>Thought him most fit for Inquisition:</L>
<L>Him therefore she dispatch'd away,</L>
<L>To know <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> SIMON had to say.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>NATHAN with this was so elate,</L>
<L>That he set off without his Hat,</L>
<L>Which gave the pious Man the Pain,</L>
<L>And Shame, of twining back again.</L>
<L>His Hat regain'd, away he stretcht,</L>
<L>Till SIMON's Mansion House he retcht:</L>
<L>Then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a while to fetch his Breath,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Countenance as pale as Death,</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="007788_0011_102D8B65EC13FB38"/>And putting on a serious Face,</L>
<L>Such as becomes a Child of Grace;</L>
<L>A Sigh he gave, and then a Groan,</L>
<L>And thus began with dismal Tone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"OUR Elders, SIMON, sent me here,</L>
<L>"Upon a weighty sad Affair:</L>
<L>"The Church is almost broken-hearted,</L>
<L>"Lest thou hast from the Truth departed:</L>
<L>"For when her Pillars are unsound,</L>
<L>"She soon will tumble to the Ground."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>QUOTH, SIMON, "NATHAN, Why all this!</L>
<L>"I pray thee tell me what's amiss?"</L>
<L>"Perhaps, <HI>Quoth Nathan,</HI> 'tis invented,</L>
<L>"Or not so bad as represented:</L>
<L>"But, Friend, it does my Mind distract,</L>
<L>"For fear the Story should be fact."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>QUOTH SIMON, "NAT come to the Case,</L>
<L>"Thou'st made, I think, a long Preface."</L>
<L>QUOTH NATHAN, "Then, the Charge is this;</L>
<L>"We think that thou hast done amiss:</L>
<L>"That thou a handsome Sum didst lend,</L>
<L>"To Neighbour GEORGE, thy trusty Friend;</L>
<L>"Altho' he told thee on his Word,</L>
<L>"He'd lay it out to buy a Sword.</L>
<L>"That with the Cash, a Sword he bought,</L>

<L>"And slain his Neighbour in the Fight,</L>
<L>"In order to obtain his Right.</L>
<L>"If this be true, thou'st gone too far,</L>
<L>"And acted out of Character.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>QUOTH SIMON, "Be not in a Hurry</L>
<L>"To judge, before you hear my Story.</L>
<L>"I lent my Cash, I freely own,</L>

<L>"Bid him his rash Design forbear,</L>

<L>"Since Christians were forbid to fight.</L>
<L>"This I repeated o'er and o'er:</L>

<L>"Thou gav'st thy Principles the Lye.</L>
<L>"For to oppose a Thing, and yet</L>

<L>"Smells strongly, SIMON, to be free,</L>
<L>"Of very gross Hypocrisy;</L>
<L>"And he that can act such a Part,</L>
<L>"Must have, I think, a carnal Heart."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>QUOTH SIMON, "Thou art warm I see▪</L>
<L>"Thou may'st be civil; yet be free:</L>
