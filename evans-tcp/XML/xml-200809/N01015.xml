<HEAD>TO THE Church and Congregation AT MALDON in <HI>New-England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is often found a truth in that which has been by many observed, <HI>viz. That the Names of those who lived much in Hea∣ven whilest they were on Earth, Live on Earth after they are in Heaven.</HI> We see an Instance of it in your <HI>Faithful Teacher,</HI> Mr. <HI>Wigglesworth,</HI> who now, <HI>is not, for God has taken him.</HI> As it was said of righteous <HI>Abel, being dead he yet speaketh</HI>; so dos your deceased Pastor <HI>Speak</HI> to you, as by his <HI>Di∣vine Poems,</HI> which are (I suppose) in many of your Houses, so by the <HI>SERMONS</HI> which he Preached to you, which will doubt∣less <HI>Live</HI> in some of your Hearts as long as you your selves shall <HI>Live</HI>: and by that

Holy <HI>Example</HI> which he set before you. For as the Apostle said to his <HI>Thessalonians, You are Witnesses how holily, and justly, and unblameably he behaved himself among you</HI>: And in the <HI>Memorials of his Piety</HI> here put into your hands, his <HI>Example</HI> will still be <HI>Living</HI> among you.</P>
<P>The Providence of God was in several things Remarkable towards him, <HI>e. g.</HI> In his being favoured with a Learned Education, after his Father had designed otherwise con∣cerning him, (as it also was with Mr. <HI>Wig∣glesworth</HI>'s Tutor, our famous <HI>Mitchel,</HI> who proved a great blessing to all the Churches in <HI>New-England</HI>:) And in his being restored to such a measure of <HI>Health,</HI> as to be able to Preach for many years twice every <HI>Lords-Day,</HI> after he had been for a long time in a Languishing condition. And although in some of the Reformed Churches, they do not permit a Minister of the Gospel to practise as a <HI>Physician,</HI> left he should thereby be too much diverted from his Sacred Employments, one of these Callings being ordinarily as much as one man can duely attend; nevertheless the Lord enabled <HI>him</HI> to manage both with good Success: So that in being bereaved of him you have lost an able Physitian both for Soul

and Body. Nor are the People in <HI>Maldon</HI> the only Persons who have sustained a loss by his Death.</P>
<P>He was moreover in his young years a blessing as a <HI>Tutor</HI> in the <HI>Colledge.</HI> It was an honour to <HI>Corderius,</HI> that the great <HI>Calvin</HI> had been his Scholar, and to Mr. <HI>Parkhurst,</HI> that the Learned <HI>Juel</HI> had been under his Instruction and Tuition, who afterwards took great delight to behold the Sparkling of that <HI>Diamond,</HI> which himself had first pointed, as one Expresseth it. Thus some who were once the <NOTE N="†" PLACE="marg"><HI>My Brother</HI> Ele∣azer Mather, <HI>Mr.</HI> John Eliot, <HI>Mr.</HI> Shu∣bael Dummer, <HI>&amp; Mr.</HI> Samuel Torrey, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Pupils</HI> of this worthy man have pro∣ved Eminent in these Chur∣ches. It will not at all add greatness or respect to his Name for <HI>Me</HI> to say, That I was his Scholar at my first Admission into the <HI>Colledge,</HI> above three and fifty years since; but I have on that account reason to honour his Memory.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Maldon</HI> in <HI>England</HI> (from which yours receives its Name) was fa∣mous for <HI>the great Men</HI> who sometimes dwelt there; it having been the place where some of the <HI>British Kings</HI> had their Residence. The Lord grant that your <HI>Maldon</HI> may be
<PB REF="001212_0005_0FB131D9E2714E78"/>
famous for <HI>the good Men</HI> that shall be in it. And it will be so, if the Lord help you to follow the Doctrine, and Example of your late Pastor, as he followed Christ. It is the duty of Churches not to forget, but to <HI>Remember those that have spoken to them the Word of God, whose Faith they are to follow, considering the End of their Conversation.</HI> This will be the way for you to obtain from the Lord <HI>JESUS CHRIST</HI> (whose gift it is) another <HI>Pastor after his own heart,</HI> who shall <HI>Feed you with knowledge and Un∣derstanding.</HI> To His Grace and Guidance I commend you, and rest,</P>

<P>TIS the Voice of our Glorious Com∣mander uttered from <HI>Heaven</HI> unto us. Every Follower of the Lord JESUS CHRIST upon <HI>Earth</HI> is concerned in the Voice. 'Tis <HI>Extensive</HI> like the Voice of the <HI>Last Trumpet</HI>; And it is pitty but it should be as <HI>Powerful.</HI></P>
<P>A Church at SMYRNA was one of the <HI>Se∣ven,</HI> to which our Enthroned Lord, most graci∣ously
<PB N="2" REF="001212_0007_0FB131DC900FBD78"/>
directed <HI>Seven Epistles.</HI> They that look for a <HI>Prophetical Interpretation</HI> of the <HI>Seven Epistles,</HI> as answering to <HI>Seven Periods</HI> in the <HI>Line of Time</HI> from our Lords Ascent unto His Advent, may help themselves thro' their Hard Task as well as they can. The <HI>Historical Interpretation</HI> suffices the more Judicious Interpreters. Our Lord, going to bid His Beloved <HI>John</HI> write the <HI>Things which were to be hereafter,</HI> bids him first of all to write the <HI>Things which then were.</HI> Our Lord would, [And how agreeable the method!] first <HI>Instruct</HI> and <HI>Reprove</HI> and <HI>Reform</HI> His People; and <HI>then</HI> communicate unto them His Divine and Secret Purposes. The Apostle, that had been a <HI>Preach∣er</HI> to the Churches in the <HI>Lydian Asia,</HI> now does the part of a <HI>Writer</HI> to them.</P>
<P>One of them was at <HI>Smyrna.</HI> Ecclesiastical Story tells us, That an horrid Storm of <HI>Persecuti∣on</HI> befel the Church at <HI>Smyrna,</HI> soon after our Lord had sent unto them the Praemonitions of it; A Storm, which was not asswaged until the Martyrdom of that brave old man, their Pastor <HI>Polycarp.</HI> A Letter of that Church yet in our hands, does relate, How cruelly the Martyrs of <HI>Smyrna</HI> were tormented, and after all their Tor∣ments they were thrown unto <HI>Wild Beasts</HI> to be devoured. And we find, that these Cruelties were push'd on, by the Envies and Slanders of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as well as by the Savage Fierceness of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord Foretold, unto the Christian <HI>Smyr∣nians,</HI> the coming of these Trials upon them. That He might Fortify them for their Trials,
<PB N="3" REF="001212_0008_0FB131DF32F695C8"/>
Behold, an <HI>Encouragement!</HI> The most Glorious, the most Marvellous, the most Engaging <HI>Encou∣ragement,</HI> that ever was offered unto the Chil∣dren of men. <HI>Generals</HI> do Encourage their Soul∣diers, with the Best they can do for them; <HI>Rich∣es,</HI> if they Live; <HI>Honours,</HI> whether they Live, or Dy. But we belong to the Armies of▪ Him, whose Name is, <HI>King of Kings,</HI> and, <HI>Lord of Lords.</HI> No <HI>King</HI> or <HI>Lord,</HI> could ever Encourage with such Assurances as ours gives to us. We are a∣nimated now, to <HI>Overcome</HI> all Discouragements in the conflict of Christianity. A CROWN OF LIFE! Methinks, it should be enough to overcome us, and make us Overcome all our Difficulties.</P>
<P>We have before us, a DOCTRINE, to En∣courage us; a DOCTRINE, which may not only Encourage us, but even Astonish us.</P>
<P>Our Lord IESUS CHRIST, will with a Glorious Crown of Life most Gloriously Reward them, who Faithfully adhere unto Him &amp; His Interests, as long as they Live.</P>
<P>There are two very Noble Subjects now to be discoursed on; Subjects that call for our most Serious Meditations, our most Rapturous Contemplations. The One is; What our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Requires</HI> of us. the Other is, What our Lord Jesus Christ <HI>Reserves</HI> for us.</P>
<P N="1">I. That which our Lord Jesus Christ has <HI>Re∣quired</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="001212_0009_0FB131E117387540"/>
of us; 'Tis, <HI>That we be <HI>Faithful</HI> unto Him, and unto His Interests, and this, as long as we Live in <HI>this World.</HI></HI></P>
<P>Now, First; <HI>Faith</HI> in the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is presupposed in them that <HI>Walk in the Name</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. It is to be presupposed, That we <HI>Believe</HI> in the Lord Jesus Christ, &amp; Rely on Him, for <HI>Wisdom,</HI> &amp; <HI>Righteousness,</HI> &amp; <HI>Holiness,</HI> &amp; <HI>Redemption.</HI> Our Lord Jesus Christ com∣mands this; Joh. 20.27. <HI>Be not Faithless, but Believing.</HI> 'Tis for this cause, that the People of God, are so often styled, <HI>The Faithful,</HI> in the Scrip∣tures of God. The Spirit of God has wrought in them, the <HI>Faith</HI> to Receive the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and His <HI>Great Salvation,</HI> as tendered in the Gospel. But <HI>Then,</HI> there is a <HI>Faithful∣ness</HI> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, which must attend and assert our <HI>Faith</HI> in Him. This <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> is not so much <HI>Faith,</HI> as <HI>Obedience.</HI> 'Tis not our <HI>Trust</HI> in Him; 'Tis our <HI>Trustiness</HI> to Him. 'Tis what the Word of God calls, <HI>Good Fidelity. Allegiance</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ, and <HI>Perseve∣rance</HI> in our Allegiance, is called for, in this call; <HI>Be thou Faithful unto Death.</HI></P>
<P>First. He that would be an <HI>Happy Christian,</HI> must be a <HI>Faithful Christian.</HI></P>
<P>But then; <HI>Who is the Faithful Christian?</HI> We will Describe him; God grant, we may answer the Description; God grant, the Description &amp; the Character may be <HI>our own.</HI> It very much belong'd unto ONE, that lately Shone among us.</P>
<P>A <HI>Faithful Christian</HI> is One, who has the <HI>Heart</HI> of a Christian, as well as the <HI>Name</HI> of a Christian.
<PB N="5" REF="001212_0010_0FB131E294244FA0"/>
He is not meerly, <HI>Dealbatus nomine Christiani,</HI> as <HI>Austin</HI> Expresses it; Superficially <HI>Whitened</HI> with the <HI>Name</HI> of a <HI>Christian.</HI> Of such an one, [and, <HI>The Father of the Faithful</HI>:] We read, Neh. 9.8. <HI>Thou foundest his Heart Faithful before thee. Faith∣fulness</HI> is opposed unto <HI>Falsehood.</HI> Every Christian does profess himself to be, <HI>A Lover of the Lord Je∣sus Christ</HI>; and, <HI>A Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> A <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian, is one that is not <HI>False</HI> in his Profession. He <HI>Loves</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ; and it is, <HI>In Sinceriy.</HI> He <HI>Serves</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ; and it is, <HI>With a Perfect Heart and a Willing Mind.</HI> They that are <HI>Faithful</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ, can say, as Gen. 42.11. <HI>Thy Servants are True men.</HI> A <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian is one who <HI>is truly,</HI> what he <HI>Seems</HI> to be.</P>
<P>And hence, it must be a Stroke in the Pour∣traiture of a <HI>Faithful Christian,</HI> That he does <HI>Practise,</HI> what he does <HI>Profess.</HI> He will not <HI>Say</HI> one thing, and <HI>Do</HI> another, in the matters of Re∣ligion. He is none of those, whom our Lord sets that black mark upon, <HI>They Say and they Do not.</HI> We read, 1 Sam. 2.35. <HI>I will raise me up a Faithful Priest, and he shall Do according to that which is in mine Heart, and in my Mind.</HI> The <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian is one to whom our Lord may say, <HI>Well Done, Good and Faithful Servant.</HI> And he is one to whom all may say, <HI>Thou doest Faithfully whatever thou doest.</HI> The Difference between a <HI>Talker,</HI> and a <HI>Doer</HI>; the Difference between <HI>Talk∣ing Well,</HI> and <HI>Well-Doing</HI>: This is the Difference between the <HI>Formal Christian,</HI> and the <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001212_0011_0FB131E41D51A168"/>We will carry on the Lovely Representation. A <HI>Faithful Christian,</HI> is a Christian <HI>Mindful</HI> of the <HI>Obligations,</HI> which are laid upon him, to Glorify the Lord Jesus Christ. There is no Christian, but what is under many <HI>Bonds</HI> and <HI>Vows</HI> to Glorify the Lord. The <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian is one, who does not Forget the <HI>Vows</HI> of God that are upon him. The Study, and the Language of the <HI>Faith∣ful</HI> Christian is that, Psal. 116.14. <HI>I will pay my Vows unto the Lord.</HI> A Christian has Entred into <HI>Covenant</HI> with God. A <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian is a <HI>Covenant-Keeping</HI> one; he is one who may say, <HI>Lord, I have not forgotten thee, nor have I dealt false∣ly in thy Covenant.</HI> Having been Washed in the <HI>Baptism</HI> of the Lord, the <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian re∣solves; <Q>Let me now never <HI>Defile</HI> my self with Sin, from which I have been <HI>Purified;</HI> Let me now always cleave to that God, the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit,</HI> unto whom I have been <HI>De∣dicated;</HI> Let me now carry on the <HI>Wars of the Lord,</HI> under the <HI>Banners,</HI> to which I have been Listed.</Q> Having been Sitting at the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord, the <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian resolves, <Q>I am now under an <HI>Oath</HI> to observe the <HI>Law</HI> of my Lord Jesus Christ: I have taken the <HI>Sacrament</HI> upon it, that the <HI>Commandment</HI> of my Lord Jesus Christ shall always give <HI>Awe</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> unto me: I have Sworn the <HI>Death</HI> of my <HI>Sin,</HI> that my <HI>Soul</HI> may <HI>Live, O my Soul,</HI> How canst thou do <HI>so great a Wickedness, as to Sin against God</HI>?</Q></P>
<P>Moreover; A <HI>Faithful Christian,</HI> is a Christian careful to make a <HI>due Improvement</HI> of the <HI>Talents,</HI> which the Lord Jesus Christ has committed unto him.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001212_0012_0FB131E58EFA3A80"/>A <HI>Faithful Servant</HI> is one who sticks to the <HI>Bu∣siness</HI> which his <HI>Master</HI> has given him to do: Even such is the <HI>Faithful Christian</HI>: And the Lord Jesus Christ, is He, of whom the Faithful Christian says, <HI>He is my MASTER; To Him I still remember my self accountable.</HI> There is no Christian, but what is be trusted with <HI>Talents,</HI> by and for the Lord. Our OPPORTUNITIES to <HI>Render,</HI> or <HI>Procure,</HI> ACKNOWLEDGMENTS unto our Lord JE∣SUS CHRIST; These are our TALENTS. A <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian, is very Sollicitous, that he may know and use his precious <HI>Opportunities,</HI> and that the Lord may have Service from him in them all. Hence, of him that made a Good use of his <HI>Talents,</HI> we read, Matth. 25.21. <HI>He is a faithful Ser∣vant.</HI> The Soul of a <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian is migh∣tily concerned upon it. He often thinks; <Q>What <HI>Good</HI> may I do? What are my Capacities to do <HI>Good</HI>! How shall I do the <HI>Good</HI> whereof God hath made be capable? Which way shall I be <HI>Servi∣ceable</HI>?</Q> Do but Inform him, how he may be <HI>Ser∣viceable,</HI> you need say no more: He will thank you for the Information: He will thankfully &amp; chear∣fully set himself to do all the Good that ever he can.</P>
<P>It follows; A <HI>Faithful Christian,</HI> is a Christian that Labours to acquit himself well in the several <HI>Relations,</HI> wherein the Lord Jesus Christ has placed him. The <HI>Place</HI> wherein God sets a man, is great∣ly to be considered, by one that would be found <HI>A Faithful Man.</HI> Are we in <HI>Publick Relations</HI>? We read of a <HI>Preacher</HI>; Jer. 23.28. <HI>Let him speak my word Faithfully.</HI> We read of a <HI>Ruler</HI>; Neh. 7.2. <HI>He was a Faithful Man, and feared God above many.</HI> Are
<PB N="8" REF="001212_0013_0FB131E84714C650"/>
we in <HI>Private Relations</HI>? We read of <HI>Children;</HI> Tit. 1.6. They must be <HI>Faithful Children.</HI> We read of <HI>Servants;</HI> Tit. 2.10. They must <HI>shew all Good Faith∣fulness.</HI> Accordingly; A <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian, how∣ever he may stand <HI>Related,</HI> he considers with him∣self, <HI>What may my Lord Jesus Christ Expect of me in this Relation</HI>? And he endeavours to conform him∣self unto the <HI>Expectations</HI> of the Lord.</P>
<P>Finally; A <HI>Faithful Christian,</HI> is a Christian that will own the <HI>Truths,</HI> and <HI>Wayes,</HI> and <HI>Cause</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, whatever may be the <HI>Trouble</HI> or <HI>Hazard</HI> of doing so. What is a <HI>Faithful Christian,</HI> but a <HI>Faithful Witness</HI> for the Lord Jesus Christ? The <HI>Truths</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ; a <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian will never Deny any of them. The <HI>Wayes</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ; a <HI>Faithful</HI> Christi∣an will never Desert any of them. Our Lord Je∣sus Christ has a <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>People</HI> in the World; a <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian will stick to that People, and never betray them, never forsake them. Whate∣ver Interest of the Lord Jesus Christ calls for the <HI>Testimony</HI> of a Christian, a <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian will openly, zealously, courageously appear, to bear his <HI>Testimony.</HI> We read, Hos. 11.12. <HI>Judah was Faithful with the Saints.</HI> What is the meaning of that? There were <HI>Faithful</HI> Ministers of God, who could not <HI>conform</HI> to the Superstitions Established by <HI>Jeroboam.</HI> These, with other <HI>Saints</HI> of their Conscientious Principle, were kindly entertained by <HI>Judah: Judah</HI> stood by those Non-conformists of <HI>Israel.</HI> This was to be <HI>Faithful with the Saints.</HI></P>
<P>Thus are we to be <HI>Faithful.</HI> But, <HI>How Long</HI> must we be so?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001212_0014_0FB131E96297BA68"/>Secondly. A <HI>Faithful Christian</HI> must maintain his <HI>Faithfulness</HI> as long as he Lives: He must <HI>never suffer his Faithfulness to fail.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Faithfulness unto Death,</HI> implyes, That we must be <HI>Faithful</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, until the ve∣ry <HI>End</HI> of our <HI>Lives.</HI> As the <HI>Faithful</HI> man said, Psal. 119.112. <HI>I have inclined my heart, to perform thy Statutes always, even unto the End;</HI> Thus, We must be <HI>Faithful</HI> unto the Lord, and the <HI>Statutes</HI> of the Lord, <HI>Always, even unto the End.</HI> A Chri∣stian is the <HI>perpetual Servant</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ; He has his <HI>Ear bored</HI> for Him: He must be <HI>Faithful</HI> unto his Lord, until he <HI>Dies.</HI> It was proposed; Psal. 146.2. <HI>While I Live will I praise the Lord; I will sing praises unto my God while I have any Be∣ing.</HI> Even so; While we <HI>Live,</HI> we must be <HI>Faith∣ful</HI> unto the Lord, &amp; Serve Him <HI>Faithfully</HI> while we have any Being. How Resolute was he? Job 27.3, 4. <HI>All the while my Breath is in me, &amp; the Spirit of God is in my Nostrils; my Lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my Tongue utter Deceit.</HI> Thus, While our <HI>Breath</HI> is in us, &amp; the Spirit which God gives us is in our <HI>Nostrils,</HI> there must be with us, no∣thing but <HI>Faithfulness;</HI> we must never deal <HI>Deceit∣fully</HI> with the Lord. Our Song must be that; <HI>We will Serve our Lord in Holiness and Righteousness and Faithfulness before Him, all the Days of our Life.</HI> I do not know, but that the famous <HI>Polycarp,</HI> [the <HI>Angel</HI> of the Church in <HI>Smyrna,</HI>] might have in his mind, this very word, <HI>Be thou Faithful unto Death,</HI> when he so answered those that press'd him to Renounce Jesus Christ: <HI>I have Served my JESUS, till I am now Fourscore &amp; six years old; &amp;
<PB N="10" REF="001212_0015_0FB131EAF8A8D260"/>
I have always found Him a good Master; I will not now Renounce him: He shall be my Master as long as I Live!</HI></P>
<P>Yea; <HI>Faithfulness unto Death,</HI> implies, That we must be <HI>Faithful</HI> unto our Lord Jesus Christ, al∣though it be with the very <HI>Loss</HI> of our <HI>Lives.</HI> Our <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ, may cost us very dear: It may cost us all the comforts of our <HI>Lives</HI>; It may cost us our very <HI>Lives.</HI> But we must venture the loss of all; and lose our very <HI>Lives</HI> rather than lose our <HI>Faithfulness.</HI> Thus those <HI>Faith∣ful</HI> ones; Rev. 12.11. <HI>They loved not their Lives unto the Death;</HI> They were willing to part with their Lives, before the Term to which they might have lived by the course of Nature. The <HI>Work</HI> we have to do for our Lord Jesus Christ, must be Dearer to us, than our very <HI>Lives.</HI> If our Lord Jesus Christ call us to part with our very <HI>Lives</HI> upon His Ac∣count we must be Ready to do it. As that <HI>Faith∣ful</HI> man Expressed himself; Act. 20.24. <HI>I count not my Life dear unto my self, so that I may finish my course with Joy</HI>: Thus we should say; <Q>I shall not count my Life dear unto my self, if I may but <HI>Faithful∣ly</HI> Discharge and <HI>Finish</HI> the Work, whereto my Lord Jesus Christ has called me.</Q> <HI>Death</HI> it self, in all the Terrors of it, must never Terrify us, from our <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to our Lord Jesus Christ. The <HI>Faithful</HI> said of old; Psal. 44.18, 19. <HI>Our Heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way; Tho' thou hast sore broken us in the place of Dra∣gons, and covered us with the shadow of Death.</HI> So should we be able to say; <Q>Tho' all the <HI>Dragons</HI> in the <HI>Valley of the shadow of Death,</HI> may seek to Sting
<PB N="11" REF="001212_0016_0FB131EC8AE45098"/>
me to Death, yet I will never <HI>Decline</HI> taking any Step that my Lord Jesus Christ shall call me to.</Q></P>
<P>Now this <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> and Constancy <HI>unto Death,</HI> tis Demanded by our Lord Jesus Christ. It is Demanded, <HI>That we be stedfast and Immoveable, al∣wayes abounding in the work of the Lord.</HI> It is De∣manded, <HI>That by patient continuance in well-doing, we seek for Eternal Life. Chrysostom</HI> observes on <HI>Luk.</HI> 22.28. The Lord Promises the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> not unto those that <HI>Followed</HI> Him only, but unto those that <HI>Continued</HI> with Him. The Demand is infinitely Reasonable. Our Lord JESUS CHRIST was <HI>Faithful unto Death</HI> in His Appearing for us; And shall not we be <HI>Faithful unto Death</HI> in our Adhe∣ring to Him? <HI>Ibi tu, Christiane, fige Cursus tui pro∣fectusque metam, ubi Christus posuit Suam,</HI> as one of the Ancients well Expressed it. Our Lord gave not over, till He was the <HI>Finisher of our Faith;</HI> our <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to Him, it must not be <HI>Finished,</HI> until we come, as He did, unto the <HI>Grave, Obedient un∣to Death.</HI> A man may <HI>Do much</HI> and <HI>Bear much</HI> for the Lord Jesus Christ; But if he be not <HI>Faithful unto Death,</HI> it is all thrown away: Gal. 3.4. <HI>So many Things in Vain</HI>! It is a Rule in the Civil Law; <HI>Factum non dicitur, quod non perseverat</HI>; That is not <HI>Done,</HI> which does not <HI>Hold▪</HI> God will not accept a <HI>Maimed Sacrifice</HI>: a <HI>Curtail'd Sacrifice.</HI> A <HI>Faith∣fulness</HI> which is not <HI>unto Death,</HI> is a <HI>Maimed Sacri∣fice.</HI> The <HI>Race</HI> is Run to no purpose, if it be not Run to the very <HI>Goal.</HI> Our <HI>Goal</HI> is our <HI>Death.</HI> In∣deed, it can be no <HI>Real Faithfulness,</HI> that is not a <HI>Last∣ing Faithfulness.</HI> A <HI>Fainting Piety</HI> is but a <HI>Feigned Piety.</HI> The Heathen could say, <HI>He never was a
<PB N="12" REF="001212_0017_0FB131EEF016F190"/>
True Friend, that ever ceases to be a Friend.</HI> He never was a <HI>Faithful Friend</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, who is not a <HI>Constant Friend</HI>; Who does not <HI>Love Him at all Times,</HI> unto the End of Time, and be∣yond all Time.</P>
<P>And now, if we are thus <HI>Faithful</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, what will be the consequence? Ve∣rily, There will be a <HI>Recompence.</HI> And it is no Fault in a Christian, to have <HI>Respect unto the Recom∣pence.</HI> Let us now Enquire after it.</P>
<P N="2">II. That which our Lord Jesus Christ has <HI>Reserv'd</HI> for us; Tis, A <HI>Crown of Life</HI> in the <HI>World to come.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! the <HI>Blessedness</HI> of the <HI>Faithful Christian!</HI> He is Disgraced, Reproached, <HI>Vilified,</HI> for his <HI>Faithfulness</HI>: The Lord Jesus Christ has a <HI>Crown</HI> to bestow upon him. He Shortens, he Resigns his <HI>Life,</HI> to please the Lord Je∣sus Christ. <HI>Life, Life,</HI> shall be his Portion.</P>
<P>We will proceed, Step after Step, unto the Consolation.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> The <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian shall at last be <HI>Deli∣vered</HI> from all the Grievous and Heavy Things, which he may suffer for his <HI>Faithfulness.</HI> All our <HI>Sufferings</HI> in and for our <HI>Faithfulness.</HI> come under the Name of <HI>Death.</HI> The <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian shall be brought into a State, wherein he shall see no more <HI>Death.</HI> He shall Enter in∣to <HI>Life</HI>; and that <HI>Life</HI> will be a State, wherein he shall see an End of all the <HI>Adversity</HI> which his <HI>Faithfulness</HI> was once Encumbred withal. We read, Rev. 21.4. <HI>God shall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, &amp; there shall be no more Death.</HI> We shall come into a State, wherein we shall meet with no <HI>Temptation</HI> to abate of our <HI>Faithfulness.</HI> There will be no <HI>Flesh</HI> crying unto us, <HI>Master, Spare thy self.</HI> There will be no <HI>Devil</HI> shooting at us his <HI>Fiery Darts</HI> to discourage us. There will be no <HI>Messenger of Satan</HI> to buffet us. As we read, Psal. 31.20, 21 <HI>Thou shalt hide them from the Pride of man; from the strife of
<PB N="13" REF="001212_0018_0FB131F02FFF6E08"/>
Tongues; Blessed be the Lord, for He hath shewed me His marvellous Kindness in a strong City. — The Lord preserveth the Faithful.</HI> Hold out, O <HI>Faithful Christian</HI>; Thou wilt shortly be in that <HI>Strong City</HI> of God, where thy <HI>Faithful∣ness</HI> will meet with nothing to Damp it, either from any <HI>Lust</HI> within, or from any <HI>Strife</HI> without. Yet a little while, and thou shalt see an <HI>End</HI> of all that was uneasy to thee: <HI>Faithful Servant,</HI> Thou shalt <HI>Enter into a Joy</HI> that shall never have an <HI>End</HI>!</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian shall find his <HI>Faith∣fulness</HI> lead him unto a <HI>Blessedness,</HI> which is called <HI>Life;</HI> which will be an <HI>Excellent,</HI> yea, an <HI>Eternal Life.</HI> Tis most certain, That our <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ will <HI>End</HI> in <HI>Endless Blessedness.</HI> Wherein will consist that <HI>Blessedness</HI>? In the <HI>Old</HI> Testament, we have it after that manner Expressed: Psal. 17.15. <HI>I shall behold thy Face in Righteousness; when I awake, I shall be satisfied with thy likeness.</HI> In the <HI>New</HI> Testament, we have it Expres∣sed after that manner; 1 Joh. 3.2. <HI>We know, that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.</HI> That incomparable, that incomprehensible <HI>Bles∣sedness,</HI> which is intended for the <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian, will be in the <HI>Vision</HI> of God, and of Jesus Christ; and in the <HI>Image</HI> of that Glorious Lord imparted unto him; and in a most intimate <HI>Communion</HI> with the glorious Lord; and in unutterable Satisfactions produced by the <HI>Spirit of Glory</HI> for ever possessing of him. This <HI>Blessedness</HI> is call∣ed, LIFE; and in that Name very precious things are intimated. A <HI>Faithful</HI> man may have his <HI>Death</HI> hasten∣ed by his <HI>Faithfulness.</HI> No; His <HI>Life</HI> is not lost. <HI>Non homo moritur, sed peccatum hominis:</HI> There <HI>Dies</HI> nothing of him, except that which is his very <HI>Death.</HI> His <HI>Faith∣fulness</HI> only brings him to a <HI>Blessedness,</HI> which is the Truest <HI>Life.</HI> The <HI>Separate Soul</HI> of a <HI>Faithful</HI> man puts on the <HI>Garments of Light</HI>; and flies away to a <HI>Paradise,</HI> and there waits in <HI>Rest</HI> and Peace, and Hope for the <HI>Resurrection of the Dead.</HI> [Rev. 14.13.] There shall at length arrive, [But, <HI>Oh Lord, How Long</HI>!] a <HI>Resurrection
<PB N="14" REF="001212_0019_0FB131F1D282E828"/>
of the Dead</HI>; The <HI>Faithful</HI> man shall then receive his <HI>Body</HI> again. His <HI>Body</HI> shall be an Incorruptible, Agile, Splendid Mansion for him. He shall in that <HI>Body,</HI> live as a Citizen of the Heavenly City, till the very Hea∣vens be no more. When a <HI>Faithful</HI> man <HI>Dies,</HI> tis to <HI>Live</HI> better than he did before. The <HI>Blessedness</HI> will be <HI>Life</HI>; Because it will be <HI>Desireable.</HI> It was said, <HI>What man is he, who desireth Life</HI>? Indeed, what man is he, who desi∣reth it not? There are few things, but what we part withal, to prolong our <HI>Life.</HI> Men are naturally and ge∣nerally loth to <HI>Dy. Nature</HI> is never willing to <HI>Dy.</HI> The cry is, <HI>Life is Good</HI>! The <HI>Blessedness</HI> intended for us, may well be Styled <HI>Life</HI>: Because indeed it is, [the Jews do well apply the Text unto <HI>this:</HI>] Psal. 63.3. <HI>Better than Life.</HI> And the <HI>Blessedness</HI> will be <HI>Life</HI>; Because it will be <HI>Durable.</HI> T'will <HI>Endure</HI>; T'will be <HI>Everlasting.</HI> A <HI>Living Thing</HI> may <HI>Dy</HI>; But <HI>Life</HI> never can <HI>Dy.</HI> We shall see <HI>Life,</HI> and never see any thing but <HI>Life.</HI> Our <HI>Blessed∣ness</HI> will be <HI>Life</HI>; Because it will be, 1 Pet. 5.10. <HI>An E∣ternal Glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> The <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian shall after all his <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> be Rewarded and <HI>Advanced,</HI> even as with the <HI>Crown</HI> of an Illustrious <HI>Conqueror.</HI> The Reward of the <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian will be, A CROWN: 2 Tim. 4.8. <HI>A Crown of Righteousness.</HI> It is to tell us, That a very high <HI>Advancement</HI> shall be the Reward of the <HI>Faithful</HI> Christi∣an. There is no higher <HI>Advancement</HI> propounded a∣mong the Ambitious Children of men, than that of com∣ing to a <HI>Crown.</HI> The <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian may meet with much <HI>Reproach,</HI> and much <HI>Contempt</HI> in the World. If a∣ny man will be <HI>Faithful</HI> to the Lord Jesus Christ, and His Churches, that man shall <HI>hear the Defaming of many.</HI> They that are <HI>Grievous Revolters</HI> from the Lord Jesus Christ, will <HI>walk with Slanders</HI> against the <HI>Faithful</HI> Champions of the Lord. As it was complained; <HI>When I wept and chastened my Soul with Fasting, that was to my Reproach.</HI> Even so, If the <HI>Faithful</HI> Servants of God are after the most Holy manner, only <HI>Praying,</HI> and <HI>Fasting</HI> before the Lord, on the
<PB N="15" REF="001212_0020_0FB131F310A00AE0"/>
behalf of His Churches, Men that are full of Satan, will invent something of <HI>Reproach</HI> against them, it may be, on that very occasion. Be patient, O Faithful ones. God intends an inconceivable Advancement for you. You shall come to that Advancement; Rev. 5.10. To <HI>be Kings and Priests for God, and Reign, over the earth. High∣ly Advanced</HI> shall the <HI>Faithful</HI> be, when they shall <HI>Sit on Throne</HI> in the <HI>Heavenly places</HI> with the Lord Jesus Christ, and they shall have <HI>power given them over the Nations</HI> of the Earth, <HI>to Rule</HI> them. <HI>Highly Advanced</HI> shall they be, when they shall <HI>Shine as the Brightness of the firmament, and as the Stars,</HI> and be employ'd in <HI>Turning many to Righteousness. Highly Advanced</HI> shall they be, when they shall be companions of <HI>Angels,</HI> and be <HI>Raised out of the Dust,</HI> and be set with those <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Nobles</HI>; and they shall indeed be the <HI>Angels,</HI> the <HI>Rulers</HI> and the <HI>Teachers</HI> of the <HI>Saved Nations.</HI> Oh! How <HI>highly Advanced,</HI> when all their <HI>Faithful</HI> Endeavours and Atchievements, will be Proclaimed with Honour in the <HI>City</HI> of God. The <HI>Streets</HI> of that <HI>Great City,</HI> shall doubtless have the Instances of our <HI>Faithfulness</HI> published in them; and those things will be done to us, which must be done to the Men, <HI>whom the King of Heaven delights to Honour.</HI></P>
<P>Why so! Because the <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian shall then be considered as a <HI>Conqueror.</HI> A <HI>Crown</HI> of old, was a <HI>prize</HI> after a <HI>Combate</HI>; the Reward of a <HI>Combate.</HI> We read, 1 Cor. 9.24, 25. of them who <HI>Run,</HI> and <HI>Strive; They do it to obtain a corruptible Crown, but we an Incorruptible.</HI> This, This will be one thing in the Reward of a <HI>Faithful</HI> Chri∣stian. When he comes to <HI>lay hold on Eternal Life,</HI> it shall be openly acknowledged: <Q>This Man has got the <HI>Victo∣ry</HI>! Unto many a <HI>Combate</HI> was this Man called in his Time; He Combated with the <HI>Flesh,</HI> and the <HI>World,</HI> and the <HI>Devil</HI>; He Combated with unknown <HI>Vexations</HI> and <HI>Confusions</HI>: But he has been Victorious over all▪ O ye <HI>Saints,</HI> O ye <HI>Angels,</HI> Glorify, Glorify that <HI>Grace</HI> that made him so!</Q> The <HI>Faithful unto Death,</HI> are all of them, <HI>Overcomers.</HI> They meet with many things di∣vert
<PB N="16" REF="001212_0021_0FB131F559E800F8"/>
them, and debauch them, from the work whereto the Lord Jesus Christ has called them. They <HI>Overcome</HI> all obstructions; They <HI>Overcome</HI> the tempters, and hold fast their Integrity. This will be acknowledged with <HI>most glorious Praises,</HI> when the <HI>Crown of Life</HI> shall be put upon their Heads. We shall then be <HI>Crowned</HI> in our Triumphs among them that are, <HI>Conquerors and more than Conquerors, thro' him that has loved us.</HI> T'will not be with a <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Lawrel,</HI> or a Garland that will Fade and Dy. No; T'will be with a <HI>Crown of Life.</HI> Our Honour a∣mong the blessed <HI>Conquerors</HI> will be a living and a lasting Honour; It shall not be said of us, <HI>Being in honour they abide not.</HI> No; 1. Pet. 5.4. <HI>Ye shall receive a Crown of Glory, that fadeth not away.</HI> But from whom?</P>
<P>Lastly. The <HI>Crown of Life,</HI> which is to be the <HI>Reward</HI> of our <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> will be the <HI>Gift</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST unto us.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Crown</HI> comes to us as a <HI>Gift.</HI> There is no <HI>Desert</HI> in our <HI>Faithfulness.</HI> We cannot by our <HI>Faithfulness</HI> ever <HI>Deserve</HI> a <HI>Crown.</HI> We never earn'd a <HI>Crumb</HI> and much less can we earn a <HI>Crown.</HI> After all our <HI>Faithfulness</HI> and our <HI>Fruitfulness,</HI> we must confess, <HI>Lord, we have been un∣profitable Servants.</HI> We read, Rom. 8.18. <HI>I reckon, that the Sufferings of this present time, are not worthy to be compar∣ed with the glory that shall be Revealed.</HI> And upon a due <HI>Reckoning</HI> we shall find, that there is no proportion be∣tween our <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> under all our <HI>Sufferings in this pre∣sent time,</HI> and the <HI>Glory</HI> in the <HI>Crown of Life</HI> that shall be conferred. Tho' <HI>Death</HI> be the <HI>Wages</HI> of our <HI>Sinfulness</HI>; Yet <HI>Eternal Life</HI> is not the <HI>Wages</HI> of our <HI>Faithfulnss</HI>: No; <HI>Tis the Gift of God.</HI> One of the Best men that ever <HI>New-England</HI> saw; [Our famous <HI>Hooker</HI>] Lying on his Death-Bed, unto one that said unto him, <HI>Sir, You are going to Receive the Reward of all your Faithful Services,</HI> made this fit Reply, <HI>Brother, I am going to Receive Mercy</HI>! 'Tis <HI>Mercy</HI> that gives the <HI>Crown</HI> unto the <HI>Faithful</HI>; The <HI>Crown of Justice</HI> is a <HI>Crown of Mercy</HI> too.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="001212_0022_0FB131F72B018198"/>Well; But this <HI>Gift</HI> comes from our Lord JE∣SUS CHRIST. Indeed, no Person in the <HI>God∣head</HI> is excluded from the <HI>Glory,</HI> of giving us our <HI>Crown of Glory. If every good Gift come</HI> from God; surely, this <HI>Gift,</HI> the <HI>Crown of Life,</HI> must come from Him. Yet our Lord JESUS CHRIST is very particularly concerned, in giving the <HI>Crown</HI> unto the <HI>Faithful</HI> Christian. 'Tis the <HI>Prince of Life,</HI> who gives the <HI>Crown of Life.</HI> 'Tis He that says, Rev. 3.21. <HI>To him that overcometh, I will grant to sit with me in my Throne.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST hath by His <HI>Death purchased</HI> for us the <HI>Crown of Life.</HI> Tis a <HI>Crown</HI> of a vast value. All the <HI>Crowns</HI> of all the Monarchs under Heaven, are but vile <HI>Caps</HI> &amp; <HI>Rags,</HI> when compared with the <HI>Crown of Life.</HI> But our Lord JESUS CHRIST has paid a <HI>Price</HI> for the <HI>Crown</HI>; Yea, tho' it be worth more than Heaven and Earth, we may say, that our Lord Jesus Christ has paid for the <HI>Crown,</HI> as much as 'tis worth. His own precious <HI>Blood,</HI> is what He has paid for it. He bore a <HI>Cross,</HI> that we might have a <HI>Crown</HI>; He wore a <HI>Crown of Thorns,</HI> that we might wear a <HI>Crown of Life.</HI></P>
<P>And our Lord JESUS CHRIST, as <HI>Mediator,</HI> has all <HI>Dominion</HI> in His Hands. He is the <HI>Dis∣poser</HI> of the <HI>Crown.</HI> The <HI>Crown of Life</HI> is at His <HI>Dispose.</HI> He may cause whom He please, to In∣herit the <HI>Throne of Glory.</HI> Our Lord JESUS CHRIST, has <HI>all power in Heaven and Earth given</HI> unto Him, &amp; so this <HI>Power</HI> of giving the <HI>Crown of Life</HI>; and bringing to Heaven those that fol∣low Him, God has <HI>given Him power over all Flesh,
<PB N="18" REF="001212_0023_0FB131F85AB8E970"/>
that He should give Eternal Life,</HI> where He shall please to give it.</P>
<P><HI>Christians,</HI> We must all cast all our <HI>Crowns</HI> at the <HI>Feet</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. It is HE that sets our <HI>Crowns</HI> on our Heads. If we have the <HI>Crown of Life,</HI> it is from Him. And so, if we are <HI>Crowned</HI> with <HI>Health,</HI> or with <HI>Wealth,</HI> or with <HI>Wit,</HI> or with any <HI>Grandeur,</HI> or with any <HI>Vertue; Thine, O Lord, is the Glory, and all comes of Thee!</HI></P>
<P>Let us now make our <HI>Inferences.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> Are <HI>Faithful</HI> Ones predestinated unto a <HI>Crown of Life?</HI> Then we owe a Good Esteem unto <HI>Faithful</HI> Ones. Whenever we see any per∣son <HI>Faithful</HI> unto the Lord Jesus Christ, we may say with our selves; <HI>That Person is an Heir of a Crown! The Lord Jesus Christ will one day bestow a Crown of Life upon that Person.</HI> To load such a Per∣son with <HI>Injuries</HI> must needs be displeasing to the Lord, <HI>whose he is,</HI> and <HI>whom he Serves</HI> with <HI>Faith∣fulness.</HI> All that Love the Lord Jesus Christ, ought also to Love them that Serve Him <HI>Faith∣fully.</HI> Those persons whom the Lord Jesus Christ will <HI>Crown,</HI> certainly we ought also to <HI>Love.</HI> Our Lord Jesus Christ says, Psal. 101.6. <HI>Mine Eyes shall be on the Faithful of the Land.</HI> The people of the Lord Jesus Christ should say so too. And when they that are <HI>Faithful unto Death,</HI> are by <HI>Death</HI> taken away from the Land, it becomes us to look after them with mournful and weeping
<PB N="19" REF="001212_0024_0FB131F9D1F13748"/>
Eyes; as we do this Day after our WIGGLES∣WORTH: it becomes us to Lament after them, and say; <HI>The Faithful, The Faithful; the Chariots of our Land, and the Horsemen thereof!</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> Shall they that are <HI>Faithful to Death,</HI> re∣ceive a <HI>Crown of Life</HI>? Then the <HI>Faithful</HI> have no cause to be <HI>afraid of Death.</HI> An Eminent person Condemned to Dy, began his Letter to his Friend upon it so; <HI>Condemnatus sum ad vitam;</HI> A <HI>Sen∣tence of Life</HI> is pass'd upon me! A Martyr coming to the Stake, there kneeled down, and cry'd out, <HI>Welcome, Everlasting Life!</HI> Oh! Let us Learn, to Welcome <HI>Death,</HI> when Gods Time for our Death arrives, under that Notion; <HI>An Inlet into Ever∣lasting Life.</HI> A <HI>Faithful</HI> man could say, Phil. 1.21. <HI>To me, to Dy is Gain.</HI> What? Loath to <HI>Gain</HI>! Will you be afraid of Receiving a <HI>Crown of Life</HI>? Tis not a <HI>Grave,</HI> but a <HI>Crown,</HI> that is before you. The <HI>Grave</HI> whereof you have such an Horror, will be but, <HI>Sepultura Laborum, vitiorum, et Lacry∣marum;</HI> the Grave of your <HI>Pains,</HI> your <HI>Sins,</HI> your <HI>Tears.</HI> To Bury these, 'tis to <HI>Live;</HI> 'tis <HI>Life</HI> in the sweetest Relish of it. <HI>Faithful Christian;</HI> Thou hast mastered every thing else. It remains now, that thy <HI>Aversion</HI> to <HI>Death,</HI> be likewise mastered. Oh! be not uneasy at the Approach of <HI>Death.</HI> As the <HI>Faithful</HI> man said, 2 Tim. 4.7, 8. <HI>I have kept the Faith; Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness.</HI> Thus, when they feel <HI>Death</HI> approaching, with what an Extasy of Gladness may the <HI>Faithful</HI> think; <Q>I have ac∣cording to my poor measure <HI>Faithfully</HI> Served
<PB N="20" REF="001212_0025_0FB131FCA64689C8"/>
my Lord JESUS CHRIST. Remember now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee, with some Sincerity and Fidelity. And now, I am going into that World, where my Lord JESUS CHRIST, will give me to see, that I have no cause to <HI>Repent</HI> of Adhering to Him.</Q> <HI>O Ye Chosen, and Called and Faithful</HI>; You have no way, to come at your <HI>Crown,</HI> but by <HI>Death.</HI> So the Last Words of our WIGGLES∣WORTH were; <HI>We must Dy, we must Dy, that we may Enter into Rest.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> 'Tis plain, We shall be no Losers by our <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to our Lord JESUS CHRIST. Let us then make it the great Prayer and Care of our <HI>Lives, That we may he Faithful unto Death.</HI> We read, Prov. 28.20. <HI>A Faithful man shall abound with Blessings.</HI> In the <HI>Abundance of Blessings,</HI> that will Reward us, can we not see, <HI>Abundance of Motives,</HI> to be very <HI>Faithful!</HI> Surely, In a <HI>Crown of Everlasting Life,</HI> there is an <HI>Abundance of Bles∣sings.</HI> Dreadful, Dreadful must be the <HI>Death,</HI> of them that are not <HI>Faithful</HI> to the Interests of the Lord Jesus Christ. If a <HI>Crown of Life</HI> shall be given unto the <HI>Faithful, What shall be given unto thee, or what shall be done unto thee,</HI> O Soul that art False unto the Lord? What? but a <HI>Death</HI> infli∣cted by the <HI>Sharp Arrows of the Almighty;</HI> a <HI>Dam∣nation</HI> worse than Lying amidst <HI>Coals of Juniper?</HI> Not a <HI>Crown of Life,</HI> but <HI>Chains</HI> of Everlasting <HI>Darkness!</HI> Terrible, very Terrible, will be the punishment of <HI>Deserters.</HI> How Terribly it Thun∣ders! Heb. 1O.38. <HI>If any man draw back, my Soul
<PB N="21" REF="001212_0026_0FB131FEE7171480"/>
shall have no pleasure in him.</HI> No pleasure! The meaning is, That the Soul of the Lord will be infinitely <HI>Displeased</HI> at him. The <HI>Crown</HI> of the <HI>Faithful,</HI> will be Life; The Doom of the <HI>Fearful,</HI> will be in the <HI>Lake</HI> of the Wrath of God. Oh! Be <HI>Fearful</HI> of incurring such a Doom!</P>
<P>It was bowayled; Psal. 12.1. <HI>The Faithful fail from among the Children of men!</HI> Let it be desired by us; <HI>Lord, Let not me fail of being found among thy Faithful Children.</HI> Wherefore; Be <HI>Prayerful,</HI> O Christian, That thou mayst be <HI>Faithful.</HI> We read, 1 Cor. 7.25. Of, <HI>One that has obtained mercy of the Lord, to be Faithful.</HI> Tis a <HI>Mercy,</HI> to be asked of the Lord!</P>
<P>And then; To <HI>Supplication</HI> joyn <HI>Meditation.</HI></P>
<P>Often think; <HI>What are the Priviledges, What the Capacities, wherewith my Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>has Entrusted me!</HI> We read, 1 Cor. 4.2. <HI>It is required in Stewards, that a man be found Faithful.</HI> Remember we, that we are bur <HI>Stewards</HI> of all that we have; And then be full of anxious Thoughts, How to acquit our selves with <HI>Faithfulness</HI> in our <HI>Stewardship.</HI></P>
<P>Again; Often think; <HI>What special Interest of my Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>now calls for a special Witness from me.</HI> We read, <HI>Prov.</HI> 14.5. about, <HI>A Faithful Witness.</HI> The Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, sometimes is most opposed in one Article, some∣times in another. Our <HI>Faithfulness</HI> must be mani∣fest, in our bearing <HI>Witness</HI> to the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ in that Article, where unadvi∣sed men are most busy at undermining it. <HI>There, There,</HI> Let us fall in, tho' we may never so much Expose our selves by doing so.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="001212_0027_0FB131FFD18609C8"/>The <HI>Crown of Life,</HI> will make amends for all.</P>
<P>Finally. Let us Tread in the Steps of them that have been <HI>Faithful.</HI></P>
<P>It was of old said; Prov. 20.6. <HI>A Faithful man who can find</HI>? Some <HI>Faithful Men</HI> have been <HI>found.</HI> We have Lately <HI>Lost</HI> such an One; Such an One was our WIGGLESWORTH, <HI>Who hath an good Re∣port of all men.</HI> One who so <HI>Faithfully</HI> demeaned himself, that (as <HI>Jerom</HI> directed of old,) <HI>De illo male Loqui nemo Potuit Sine mendacio.</HI> Because, it may contribute unto the <HI>finding</HI> of more Such, I shall give you some short Account of his <HI>Faithfulness;</HI> &amp; <HI>Proclaim his Goodness</HI>: but, as tis most Reasonable, my Account shall be given with the most accu∣rate and unspotted <HI>Faithfulness.</HI></P>
<P>I may truly affirm concerning him, That <HI>Faithfulness, Faithfulness,</HI> was the very thing that remarkably Characterized him, Distin∣guished him.</P>
<P>He was descended of Eminently Religious Pa∣rents, who were great Sufferers for that which was then, The <HI>Cause of God,</HI> and of <HI>New-England.</HI> While he was yet a Youth, he was marvellously concern∣ed, That he might have an Heart filled with the Spirit of God. This concernment upon his mind appeared especially in his Watchful Endeavours to have <HI>Spiritual Sins,</HI> chased out of his cleansed Heart. PRIDE, the Sin of <HI>Young</HI> men, yea, of <HI>all</HI> men; PRIDE, the Sin which few men Try or Trouble themselves about; this Devout Youth, was full of Holy and Watchful Trouble about it: And he <HI>then</HI> wrote a very Savoury Discourse, En∣tituled, <HI>Considerations against Pride.</HI> And another
<PB N="23" REF="001212_0028_0FB132014EC693D8"/>
Entituled, <HI>Considerations against Delighting more in the Creature than in God.</HI> This was to mortify in him∣self the Sins rarely minded by the most of men.</P>
<P>Having had a Pious and a Learned Education, the first Publick Station wherein I find him, was that of a <HI>Fellow,</HI> and a <HI>Tutor,</HI> in <HI>Harvard-Colledge.</HI> With a rare <HI>Faithfulness</HI> did he adorn the Station! He used all the means imaginable, to make his <HI>Pupils</HI> not only good <HI>Scholars,</HI> but also good <HI>Christians;</HI> and instil into them those things, which might render them rich Blessings unto the <HI>Churches</HI> of God. Unto his Watchful and Painful Essayes, to keep them close unto their <HI>Academical Exercises,</HI> he added, Serious Admonitions unto them about their Interiour State, and (as I find in his Reserved Papers) he Employ'd his <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Tears</HI> to God for them, &amp; had such a flaming zeal, to make them worthy men, that, upon Re∣flection, he was afraid, Lest his <HI>cares for their Good, and his affection to them, should so drink up his very Spirit, as to steal away his Heart from God.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the Star made his Remove, till he comes to dispense his Sweet Influences, upon thee, O <HI>Maldon</HI>: And he was thy <HI>Faithful</HI> One, for about a <HI>Jubilee</HI> of years together.</P>
<P>It was not long after his coming to <HI>Maldon,</HI> that a Sickly Constitution so prevailed upon him as to confine him, from his Publick Work, for some whole Sevens of years. His <HI>Faithfulness</HI> continu∣ed, when his <HI>Ministry</HI> was thus interrupted. The Kindness of his Tender Flock unto him, was ans∣wered in his Kind concern to have them Served by other Hands. He took a Short Voyage unto
<PB N="24" REF="001212_0029_0FB13203C0DAB060"/>
another Country, for the Recovery of his Health; which tho' he Recovered not, yet at his Return, I find him comforting himself, with inserting of this Passage, in his Reserved Papers.</P>
<P><HI>Peradventure the Lord removed me for a Season, that He might set a better Watchman over this His Flock, and a more Painful Labourer in His Vineyard. This was one thing that I aimed at in Removing (to help the Peoples Modesty in the Case,) and I believe the Lord aimed at it, in removing me for a Season.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Faithfulness</HI> now appeared, in his <HI>Edifying Discourses,</HI> to those that came anear him; A Thing wherein he was very <HI>Careful</HI> and <HI>Fruitful</HI>; much bewayling the want of a Profitable and Religious Conversation, in so many that Profess Religion. And that he might yet more <HI>Faithfully</HI> set himself to Do Good, when he could not <HI>Preach,</HI> he <HI>Wrote</HI> several Composures, wherein he proposed the E∣dification of such Readers, as are for Truth's dres∣sed up in a <HI>Plain Meeter.</HI> These Composures have had their Acceptance and Advantage among that sort of Readers; &amp; one of them, <HI>The Day of Doom,</HI> which has been often Reprinted in both <HI>Englands,</HI> may perhaps find our Children, till the <HI>Day</HI> it self arrive.</P>
<P>It pleased God, when the Distresses of the Church in <HI>Maldon,</HI> did extremely call for it, won∣drously to Restore His <HI>Faithful Servant.</HI> He that had been for near Twenty years almost <HI>Buried A∣live,</HI> comes abroad again; and for as many years more, must in a <HI>Publick Usefulness,</HI> receive the Answer and Harvest of the Thousands of Suppli∣cations, with which the <HI>God of his Health,</HI> had been addressed by him &amp; for him.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="001212_0030_0FB132052E2216D0"/>How <HI>Faithfully</HI> did he now, Deliver the <HI>whole Counsel of God!</HI></P>
<P>How <HI>Faithfully</HI> did he Rebuke <HI>Sin,</HI> both in his <HI>Ministry</HI> and in his <HI>Discipline</HI>!</P>
<P>How <HI>Faithful</HI> was he to the <HI>Work</HI> of God in the Churches of <HI>New-England,</HI> and Grieved at every thing that he thought had any Tendency to in∣commode that glorious Work?</P>
<P>But how <HI>Patient,</HI> how <HI>Living,</HI> how <HI>Charitable,</HI> to such as in Lesser matters differed from him! Of this <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> you are all of you Witnesses!</P>
<P>How <HI>Faithful</HI> was he in the Education of his <HI>Family!</HI> A very <HI>Abraham,</HI> for his Commands unto his Family, to <HI>Keep the Way of the Lord;</HI> A very <HI>David,</HI> for his Charges unto them, to <HI>Know the God of their Father, and Serve Him!</HI></P>
<P>His long Weakness, and Illness, made him an <HI>Able Physician.</HI> He Studied <HI>Physick;</HI> and was a <HI>Faithful Physician</HI> for the <HI>Body</HI> as well as the <HI>Soul.</HI> God made him a <HI>Successful Physician,</HI> &amp; a <HI>Beloved</HI> one.</P>
<P>For such things, his Flock Loved him. Your <HI>Love,</HI> show'd it self, when a Dangerous Fit of <HI>Sickness</HI> was upon him, above Seven years ago. You came together with Agony; you <HI>Prayed,</HI> and <HI>Fasted</HI> and <HI>Wept</HI> before the Lord, with Publick Sup∣plications for his <HI>Life.</HI> God heard you; God Loves to hear such Prayers. God Spared him yet unto you, <HI>Another Life.</HI> For <HI>Seven years</HI> more, you had him among you.</P>
<P>As he was <HI>Faithful to the Death,</HI> so he was <HI>Lively to the Death.</HI> He earnestly Desired, That he might hold out, <HI>Useful unto the Last.</HI> God granted him his Desire; A Desire seldom denied unto them

that are so Importunate in it. It was a surprize unto us, to see a Little Feeble <HI>Shadow of a Man,</HI> beyond <HI>Seventy, Preaching</HI> usually Twice or Thrice in a Week; Visiting and Comforting the <HI>Afflict∣ed;</HI> Encouraging the <HI>Private Meetings; Catechi∣sing</HI> the Children of the Flock; and managing the <HI>Government</HI> of the Church: and attending the <HI>Sick,</HI> not only as a <HI>Pastor,</HI> but as a <HI>Physician</HI> too; and this not only in his own Town, but also in all those of the Vicinity. Thus he did, <HI>unto the last;</HI> and he was but one <HI>Lords-Day</HI> ta∣ken off, before his <HI>Last.</HI></P>
<P>But in the <HI>Last Week</HI> of his Life, how full of <HI>Resignation!</HI> how full of <HI>Satisfaction;</HI></P>
<P>Sirs, His <HI>Instruction</HI> must <HI>Live</HI> with you, tho' he be <HI>Dead.</HI> Yea, and his <HI>Example</HI> too; his Holy <HI>Example;</HI> the <HI>Example</HI> of his <HI>Holiness</HI> &amp; his <HI>Faith∣fulness.</HI></P>
<P>From his Exemplary Life, I will single out one thing, to be peculiarly inculcated. That one thing is, His <HI>Early Religion.</HI> Oh! That the Young Ones of the Flock, would but follow their Aged Pastor, in this amiable and admirable Excellency! His <HI>Early Religion.</HI> I have known it a <HI>Temptation,</HI> buzz'd by Satan into the minds of Children; That if they feared God, and sought Christ, &amp; zealously made sure of <HI>Heaven</HI> betimes, they should not <HI>Live Long</HI> upon Earth. If it were so! —Certainly, <HI>Heaven</HI> is better than <HI>Earth.</HI> But it is a <HI>Foolish</HI> Tempta∣tion. Our <HI>Wigglesworth</HI> was a Godly Child; and he held on Living to God &amp; Christ, until the Seventy Fourth Year of his Age. When
<PB N="27" REF="001212_0032_0FB1320839AF5D50"/>
he then lay a Dying, Some spoke to him, about his having Secured, his <HI>Interest</HI> in the Favour of Heaven, and his <HI>Assurance</HI> of that Interest. He replyed, [methoughts, like my <HI>Polycarp</HI>:] <HI>I bless God, I began that work betimes; And e're I was Twenty years old, I had made thorough work of it. Ever since then, I have been pressing after the Power of Godliness, the Power of Godliness! For more than Fifty, years to∣gether, I have been Labouring to uphold a Life of Com∣munion with God; and I thank the Lord, I now find the Comfort of it!</HI> Words, that contain in them, <HI>An History of a Life,</HI> more valuable than I have seen a Volumn in <HI>Folio.</HI></P>
<P>Follow your <HI>Pastor,</HI> as he followed our <HI>Saviour.</HI> Then, all you that have been brought nearer to God, by his <HI>Faithful Ministry,</HI> will one Day meet him in the <HI>City of God.</HI> Oh! Joyful Meeting! When he shall say, <HI>Blessed be God, That ever I spoke to those Persons!</HI> And you shall say, <HI>Blessed be God, that ever I heard the Voice of that Man! —</HI></P>
<P>All that I will add, is this; May our Ascended and Glorious Lord bestow such another <HI>Gift,</HI> upon His dear People here!</P>

<HEAD><HI>An Appendix.</HI> Containing a few MEMORIALS of PIETY; Faithfully Extracted from the Reserved Papers of Mr. <HI>Michael Wigglesworth.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Survivers have often received incompa∣rable Benefits, from the <HI>Reserved Papers</HI> of Good Men; which they have Written only for the Help of their own <HI>Memories</HI> and <HI>Affections,</HI> &amp; with∣out the least Imagination, that they would ever get from under that Character of <HI>Reserved Papers.</HI></P>
<P>Tis now found, that such had our <HI>Wiggles∣worth.</HI> Indeed they generally contain his humble, but severe, <HI>Animadversions</HI> upon <HI>himself,</HI> and such as argue a great Flight of <HI>Holiness</HI> in him from his <HI>Youth</HI>; and they contain many other <HI>Per∣sonal Matters,</HI> in which the Publick is no way con∣cerned. Nevertheless, in perusing such of them, as fell into my Hands, I thought I should <HI>Hide a Talent,</HI> if I did not Extract from thence, a few Pas∣sages, which may have a Special Tendency to serve the Designs of <HI>Piety</HI> abroad in the World. They are such as these.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>¶ <HI>1.</HI> [While he was a Tutor at the Colledge.]</HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> I find my Heart prone, to take Secret Plea∣sure, in thinking, <HI>How much I do for the Good
<PB N="29" REF="001212_0034_0FB1320BD7516BE0"/>
of others</HI>? But, Lord, How Little of it is done for <HI>Thee</HI>? I fear, there is much of Doting upon the Creature, in my pursuit of the Good of others. I cannot Seek the <HI>Glory of God</HI> therein, but am car∣ried most with <HI>Pitty to Man;</HI> Else the Lord would hardly cross me in my Endeavours.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> Oh! Let me not unthankfully, and wick∣edly make the Gifts of God, Subservient unto my <HI>Vain Glory!</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> It is very hard for me, to set my Heart up∣on God Himself, and not rest in the Creature; (or else to be restless and disconsolate:) altho' I see, God is willing to have me come into His pre∣sence, and to satisfy my Soul in sweet Communi∣on with Himself; and infinitely mere willing, than I am, that any of those I Love most, should be near me, and that I could be communicating the greatest Good unto them; which certainly is one of the main things I desire upon Earth.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> Some comfort God gave me in Himself; finding my Love to Man, not Rewarded with like Love again. He helped me to Rejoyce in the Testimony of a Good Conscience, and Looking unto Him, not unto Man, for the Reward of my Labours.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> I thought, if God would not Save me at Last, yet there was <HI>something that pleased</HI> me in this; <HI>That my Lord should still have Glory.</HI> Hereupon I Reflected, Saying, <Q>And whence hast thou any such Endearedness of Affection to the <HI>Glory</HI> of Christ? Canst thou Desire His <HI>Glory,</HI> without some Love to Him? Canst thou Love Him, Ex∣cept He Loved thee first? Then has God indeed
<PB N="30" REF="001212_0035_0FB1320D5AD69718"/>
Loved thee with an Everlasting Love.</Q> This some what Revived me.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> It pleased God in some measure to scatter my Doubts, when I considered; How clearly did God once and again draw me to His Son, for all Good, when I could find none in my self? Then making with me a <HI>Covenant, Ordered in all things &amp; sure.</HI> This remains, tho' I can't find such sensible Qualifications in my self; which I desire, bitter∣ly to bewail it before God that I can't. Yet, whilst I Live, I will not Let Him Go. Moreover, I appeal to God Himself, the Searcher of Hearts, to see whether there be, or have been, no prizing of God above other things. What else means, my Restlessness after Sin committed, until I have made my Peace with God? Or, if that be from <HI>Fear</HI> of Punishment, rather than <HI>Love,</HI> to thy self, <HI>Lord,</HI> yet what means that Substantial <HI>Soul-Con∣tentment</HI> I have found in thy self, when Creatures have failed; and which I never found any where but in thy self ? What is it but that gives me Sup∣port, when Creatures frown? When I cannot Re∣ceive what I desire from thee? Is it not, that I have all in thee? and that thou art mine, who art better than all? Away, Thou Unbelief! A∣way, ye Soul-sinking Discouragements!</P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> I see a Need of a whole CHRIST; and I Desire Him. Oh, Help my want of Desire. I <HI>Need</HI> Him, and therefore, <HI>Lord,</HI> according to thy Free and Gracious Offer and Command, I Desire to Take Him; As a <HI>Prophet,</HI> to Reveal His Fathers Glory to me; that God may be most Glorious in my Eyes; I can see no Glory in thee, <HI>Lord,</HI> Except
<PB N="31" REF="001212_0036_0FB1320EE87E0EF0"/>
thy only-begotton Son Reveal thee. I desire Him, as my only <HI>Priest,</HI> &amp; Propitiation. I have <HI>Daily Sins,</HI> and therefore, I want Him for my Daily Atone∣ment; that my Sins may not Separate between me and my God, and Provoke Him, and His Spirit, whose Visitations preserve my Spirit, to Depart from me; That's my <HI>Death</HI> which I am afraid of! And that I may be accepted for His Sake, who in and of my self, deserve only Condemnation. I desire Him, to be my <HI>King</HI>; that He may subdue all the Enmity of my Heart against Him; that I may no longer loath Him without a cause; nor Love other things above Him; that He may sub∣due my unconquerable Corruptions, which I des∣pair in &amp; of my self to subdue; &amp; which Eat out actual Love to God, &amp; the Relish of His Ways.</P>
<P><HI>Lord,</HI> Let it be to thy poor Creature, according to thy Word. Let Christ be mine; Let me be His alone. I come to thee, to make me every day more willing that it should be so.</P>
<P N="8"><HI>VIII.</HI> I cannot see my Studies &amp; Pains, perform∣ed for God, and Accepted by God, because I have so much Love to my Studies, and so Little to God Himself. Yet, Blessed be His Name, that lets me not be at Rest, in the Bosome of the Creature, but Exercises me with often Fears of Losing Himself. When God Hides His Face, I am Troubled, how∣ever other things fare. <HI>Father, Deliver me from that Evil man, My Self!</HI></P>
<P N="9"><HI>IX.</HI> I cannot prevail against that Cursed Frame; To think the Time long that I spend in <HI>Reading the Word of God.</HI> Outgoings of Heart after my Studies again get head. My Heart even blesses
<PB N="32" REF="001212_0037_0FB132104EA18390"/>
God, when He lets me meet with Crosses in Crea∣tures; For then is the Creator most Sweet &amp; De∣sireable. My Spirit within me Desires Him, &amp; is afraid of Losing Him, by Losing my Desires to Him.</P>
<P N="10"><HI>X.</HI> Oh! Kindle in me a glorious Esteem of the glorious Saviour. When I hear, the Father gives a Welcome Entertainment unto Him in Heaven, Let not me slight Him upon Earth.</P>
<P N="11"><HI>XI. Lord,</HI> Art not thou as ready to give me of thy Spirit, as I am, to give, if I could, my Spirit unto all my Pupils? <HI>Lord,</HI> Save me; Thou art my <HI>Tutor,</HI> and my Father!</P>
<P>I desire to aggravate my Sin, and fly only to the Blood of Jesus. The more dead-hearted I am, the more Rich is that Grace of thine, <HI>Father,</HI> which will notwithstanding Accept me in thy Son.</P>
<P N="12"><HI>XII.</HI> I hope, the Lord hath in some measure answered my long Desires, in granting me at length, a Spirit of Fear lest I should, lose Christ, and care that I might have daily communion with Him, and rest my Soul in his Bosome, and and make Him my Life.</P>
<P N="13"><HI>XIII.</HI> Outward wants, at least the Fears of them, Disquiet me, or would do so. But I dare not let them make Impression, nor be Earnest with God for the supply of them, lest my Desires there∣of should exceed my Desires of Sanctifying Grace.</P>
<P N="14"><HI>XIV.</HI> I am unworthy to lift up mine Eyes unto Heaven, because proud, and vain, and forgetful of God. Yet, verily, thou art my Father. Thou givest me ground of Encouragement, because I find a daily Restlessness under Sin committed, without Renewed Repentance; my Soul is Brea∣thing
<PB N="33" REF="001212_0038_0FB132130C2204A0"/>
after God: Emptiness on all things else; God cleareth up to me His calling of me; and causeth me to come to His Son, and close with Him on Gospel-Terms.</P>
<P N="15"><HI>XV.</HI> It is a Death, to think of being left by Gods Spirit in His Ordinances, and left to set light by them.</P>
<P N="16"><HI>XVI.</HI> Yesterday, I was in a Doubt, Whether I should go to <HI>Watertown</HI>-Lecture, or not; because of multiplicity of Business. I went nevertheless. And this Day, thro' Gods Assistance I have done as much as I used to do in two Dayes.</P>
<P N="17"><HI>XVII.</HI> The Lord lets in some comfort into me, in that, tho' I be sinful and impotent unto any thing that is Good, yet He hath made Christ <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Strength,</HI> to me, and Accepts me thro' Him. Which was evidenced to me, by my longings and reachings of Heart after the Lord, not finding Satisfaction any where else. And in my desiring and promoting the Glory of God, that He may be advanced by my self and many others. How can I Love the Lord, or His Glo∣ry, except He have Loved me? And if He have so done, He will ever do the same.</P>
<P N="18"><HI>XVIII.</HI> Gods Visiting Hand has now pluck't a∣way from us, Four Brethren of our Church in a few Dayes. The Lord was pleased to set in, and break my Heart, and shew me, that I am the man, who Sin unto Death the precious Servants of God, and drive God from the place and society where I Live, and I pull down Wrath. Yea, I have sinned unto Death, the Lord JESUS! This most affected me, That I have Crucified the Lord
<PB N="34" REF="001212_0039_0FB1321419C13B30"/>
of Glory! And as if that had not been enough, I am daily grieving &amp; wounding of Him afresh.</P>
<P N="19"><HI>XIX.</HI> I was afraid, lest my Soul never rested in Christ, and found satisfaction in Christ alone. The Lord helped me over these Fears; In that, I daily war and wrestle against an Heart that is Resting any where but in Christ. And my wan∣drings make for my further Establishment, and closer cleaving to Christ: God sends vexation in the Creature, and makes me seek and find more abundant sweetness in Him. So I concluded, Christ was mine; &amp; all Spiritual Blessings in Him.</P>
<P N="20"><HI>XX.</HI> The Lord affects my Heart with some shame, that I should so Dishonour my Fathers House, as to feed upon Husks, when He has Bread Enough for me: That I should promise my self any Paradise under the Sun, when as I have experimentally found all to be vanity and vexa∣tion of Spirit; That I should mind or desire the love of the Creature, more than take contentment in the love of Christ, who loveth me better than any Creature can do, and who is more able to do for me, what I stand in need of, than any, yea, than all besides.</P>
<P N="21"><HI>XXI.</HI> My God, and His Service, is all that I have to Delight my self in, in this World.</P>
<P N="22"><HI>XXII.</HI> God sends me in some support. For, <HI>First</HI>; I have desired and delighted in (not Hea∣ven, or any Created Excellencies, but) God Him∣self, who is my Hearts contentment. <HI>Secondly.</HI> I do not desire Holiness for Heaven, but for the Love I bear to God and Christ, and out of my Desire to please Him. And I should desire it, if
<PB N="35" REF="001212_0040_0FB13215DA4864C0"/>
there were neither Hell nor Heaven, and I de∣sire universal Holiness. And it is my very Hap∣piness to do God some Service before I dy. That's all I have to comfort me against my Sorrows. And that is one end, why I desire communion with God; that I may be like Him. Such a <HI>Christ</HI> pleases me best, as will make me <HI>Holy.</HI></P>
<P N="23"><HI>XXIII.</HI> My Morning-Desires on the Sabbath were, That I might do nothing for <HI>my self,</HI> to set forth <HI>my self</HI>; but all for <HI>God;</HI> and that I might mind <HI>God,</HI> and not <HI>Man,</HI> in all the Duties thereof.</P>
<P N="24"><HI>XXIV.</HI> Methinks, These <HI>Sabbaths</HI> are blessed Seasons, wherein poor wandring Harlots, may return to their Husband again. Oh! the bound∣less and inexhaustible Fountain of Mercy, that is with God and Christ, to Entertain again such as I am! Behold, I come unto thee; Thou art the Lord my God! Tho' vain Thoughts, and Pride, are rife and prevail in me, &amp; what I would do, Lord, I cannot, yet I bless thee, that I have Time and Heart, to mourn for what I do amiss.</P>
<P N="25"><HI>XXV.</HI> I find, that the clearest Arguments that can be, cannot perswade my Heart to believe the Being of a GOD, if God do not let the Beams of His Glory shine into it.</P>
<P N="26"><HI>XXVI.</HI> I have sometimes thought, that in one Quarter of an Hours Sense of Gods Favour (tho' in a Weak measure,) I found more Joy and In∣ward Pleasure than Ever I found in my Twenty years course, by any Worldly Contentments.</P>
<P N="27"><PB N="36" REF="001212_0041_0FB132171AE92CE8"/><HI>XXVII.</HI> What if I have a False and De∣ceitful Heart; bent to Apostatize from God? Shall I therefore utterly turn away from Him? No. God forbid. I will seek unto Him, to give me Truth in my Inward Parts. I have an Heart over-powered with Sin. My Corrup∣tions are too hard for me. And this is the Grief of my Heart, that I cannot be Suffici∣ently Humbled for them. This is my Bur∣then of Burthens. And, whither should I go, but unto Christ, to ease me? <HI>The Bruised Reed He will not break, and the Smoaking Flax He will not quench.</HI> He has bid me <HI>Hope in His Word,</HI> and <HI>Wait</HI> on Him. He has reached out His Hand to me, and by that Hand I will hold, and never let Him go, never give Him Rest until He make me see His Salvation. <HI>If I perish, Let me perish waiting on Him</HI>!</P>
<P N="28"><HI>XXVIII.</HI> I have found such vile and blas∣phemous Injections of Satan into my mind, and such carnal Conceptions, and bodily Ap∣prehensions of God, even in my Drawings near unto Him, and I had no power to Resist them, they were so sudden; that they did even make my Flesh to Tremble, and drive me al∣most to desperate Thoughts sometimes, that these could never be cured so long as Lived in this World, and made me fear lest I should Live long here, to be ever and anon Stared in
<PB N="37" REF="001212_0042_0FB1321A0B8E9670"/>
the face, by such horrible abominations. I sought God earnestly for help against these; and found some help. Could I ask in Faith without Wavering, there is Redeeming Mercy with God, and He will Redeem such as hope in Him.</P>
<P N="29"><HI>XXIX.</HI> It pleased God to draw near unto my Soul, when I saw the Administration of BAPTISM; bidding me look back to my <HI>Bap∣tism,</HI> and see the Lord JESUS there setting His <HI>Seal</HI> upon me, and making a Covenant with me, to become Mine, if, when I came to years of Understanding, I would own His Co∣venant, and be willing to accept of that Grace which He had Seal'd unto me. My Soul an∣swered, <HI>Lord! That Grace, and that Son of God, I desire to Embrace!</HI> Why, God is willing on His part, yea, stands with both His Arms o∣pen to Receive thee; This administred a great deal of comfort to my Heart, and Strengthen∣ing to my Feeble Faith.</P>
<P N="30"><HI>XXX.</HI> The Life of Godliness, and Power thereof, is apt to be worn out of my Heart and Actions, and that suddenly. But in Repenting and Turning unto God, in seeing my own Vileness, and Fleeing to God for Help, there I find Support. And it is a sweet and blessed thing, to have the Bosom of a Reconciled God and Father in Christ Jesus, to repose my Soul
<PB N="38" REF="001212_0043_0FB1321AD3485B08"/>
in, after I have wearied my self with the pur∣suit of Vanity.</P>
<P N="31"><HI>XXXI. One</HI> was speaking in Commendati∣on, of seasonable Laughter &amp; Merriment, as that which may be a means to Recreate ones tired Spirits, and prolong ones Life. But, alas, my Heart is so naught, that should I give it Li∣berty there, I have cause to fear, lest I should take pleasure, for it self, without Reference to Health, and so to the Glory of God, and then it would be Sin unto me. And let me rather Live a Melancholy Life all my days, than by Merriment run into a course of provoking my God.</P>
<P N="32"><HI>XXXII.</HI> I could not go thro' my Study, with Delight &amp; Comfort. God would here it may be show me, how far even my Studies fall short of giving my Heart true Content. And Oh! that this might make me prize the Lord more, in whom alone my Soul finds Support; in whom are all my Springs. <HI>Return, Return, Blessed Father, with the manifestations of thy self, and communications of thy Heavenly Grace to my Soul.</HI></P>

<HI>If Christ be mine, and all Fulness in Him, and God willing to give it, and I seek it, Why find I not Grace in my Need?</HI> It was answer∣ed. First; It is to make a man Examine, and be sure he has a <HI>Christ,</HI> and so a Right to it. Secondly. If he be sure, then to make him Live by <HI>Faith,</HI> and not <HI>Sense</HI>; to make him a poor Nothing. Thirdly, Tis to Exercise <HI>Patience</HI> and all Grace. Lastly. Tis to break his <HI>Will,</HI> and make him <HI>Meek.</HI></P>
<P N="34"><HI>XXXIV.</HI> I was full of fears and sad thoughts. But for my Re-encouragement, God Let in these Evidences. <HI>First.</HI> My Love to His People above others; among them, my greatest Love, to the most Godly. <HI>Se∣condly.</HI> My unfeigned Desires, and some small Endeavours also, to bring the Souls of others into Hatred of Sin, and into Love with God.</P>
<P N="35"><HI>XXXV.</HI> This was the Stumbling-block I alwayes fell at, (while yet unregenerate;) the great thing, that barr'd me from coming to Christ, and closing with Him; the Ruin and undoing of my Soul: That I thought, <HI>I was not humbled enough, to Receive Christ.</HI> I durst not close with Him in a Promise, but still put from me, so great Salvation; hoping to get a greater measure of <HI>Humiliation</HI>; and so of Fitness for Him. So by the Strength

of Sin in me, I was still brought back again, into full Slavery and Bondage. And what Impressions, Affections, Resolutions God wrought in me, this Sabbath-Day, all were Eaten our, and quite lost, in a manner before the next: So that I was as far off from Christ, and a broken Heart, at the years End, as at the Beginning.</P>

<HEAD>¶ <HI>2.</HI> [After he was invited unto <HI>Maldon,</HI> and then was taken off by Long Sickness.]</HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> I Have been musing upon this point, <HI>That GOD</HI> is. Besides what Arguments I read in others, these are presented unto me.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="41" REF="001212_0046_0FB13220B5D87838"/>1. If there were <HI>No God,</HI> mens Hearts would not be so full of Enmity against God as they are.</P>
<P N="2">2. Once I was <HI>Blind,</HI> but now I <HI>See;</HI> once <HI>Dead,</HI> but now <HI>Alive;</HI> once loving Sin, and ha∣ting Holiness. Who made this <HI>Change</HI>? Not, <HI>Self.</HI> For to me, Believing was impossible. Not <HI>Men.</HI> For why are not others Converted, that are less Hardened in Sin; or why was not I Con∣verted sooner, while it was easier! Not, <HI>Satan.</HI> He is not such a Fool, to destroy his own King∣dom. Therefore, it was GOD. Therefore <HI>God is.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. My <HI>Prayers</HI> have been answered from time to time. Therefore there is a GOD, who hath heard me. If there were <HI>no God,</HI> how should my <HI>Prayers</HI> have been heard? Whoever doubts of his Being, let <HI>me</HI> never doubt of it, who have <HI>Seen</HI> him, and <HI>Felt</HI> him; not only <HI>Heard</HI> of him.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> These are the <HI>Principles,</HI> which the Lord has been teaching me by his Afflicting Dispen∣sations this Winter.</P>
<P N="1">1. To Rejoice in <HI>Acting according to the Rule,</HI> whatever the Event be, Good or Evil. Mind <HI>my Work,</HI> which is <HI>Duty;</HI> and let God alone with the <HI>Event,</HI> which is <HI>His Work.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Not to Rejoyce much in any <HI>Creature.</HI> Thou knowest not, whether it shall comfort thee, or Torment thee.</P>
<P N="3">3. Not to be Troubled with Evil before it come. <HI>Sufficient is the Trouble of the Day, when it is come.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. To be humbly Thankful for Life, &amp; Health, and Liberty to Serve God heretofore; though I should Enjoy them no longer.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="42" REF="001212_0047_0FB132219C5BB460"/>5. To Fight against <HI>Melancholy,</HI> and unbelieving Thoughts: Not by <HI>Debating</HI> with them, (for so they are too hard for me:) but by Sleighting them, and not Attending to them.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> I am afraid, Lest I desire <HI>Health</HI> more than <HI>Holiness</HI>: (tho' I desire <HI>that</HI> also, that I might have Opportunity for further Exercise of <HI>Holiness</HI>:) But what Good will my Life or Health, do me, Good Lord, if I Live not to thy Praise &amp; Honour?</P>
<Q><L>IV. Christe, Parum doleo quia Te non diligo multum:</L>
<L>Quodque Parum doleo, causa Doloris Erit.</L></Q>
<P N="5"><HI>V. Lords-Day.</HI> I have been almost discouraged, finding my Heart so carnal, and my Conversation so Fruitless, on the <HI>Week-days,</HI> when as my Soul hath been so Earnest with God, for more Grace, upon the <HI>Lords-Dayes.</HI> But God be thanked; I have obtained a Little Strength this Last Week, to honour God with my Lips, and Speak of Him, and for Him. This Encourages me, to seek Him the more Earnestly this Day. <HI>Lord,</HI> Help me to Seek thee, and Serve thee with my whole Heart. And, Oh, Quicken me, and others by me!</P>
<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> I Earnestly Desire▪ Deliverance from my Long continued &amp; increasing Weakness. Because I am thereby detained from the Liberties of Gods House and Ordinances. And, because it is a sore Hindrance to my Personal Communion with God, and Holy Walking. I cannot take that pains with my carnal Heart, that its Necessities requires. I cannot make a fervent Prayer, but my Strength

faileth, before I have half unburthened my Heart, or spread my case before the Lord. I cannot think a few serious Thoughts, Except now and then a short <HI>Ejaculation,</HI> which does not so Effectu∣ally take off the Heart from things Below, &amp; car∣ry it into Heaven, as Set and Solemn <HI>Maditation</HI> was wont to do.</P>
<LG>
<L>VII. Ira premit, Peccata gravant, afflicto frangit;</L>
<L>Omnia Sub caelo me quoque destituunt.</L>
<L>Aeger, Inops, Orbus, curarum pondere fessus,</L>
<L>Corpore Languescens, Deficiens Animo.</L>
<L>Obruor adversis; Succedunt imbribus imbres,</L>
<L>Meque Simul feriunt, Venturs et unda minax.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My <HI>Sins</HI> &amp; <HI>Wants</HI> still pain my Heart.</L>
<L>My <HI>Hope</HI> in Christ, relieves my Smart.</L>
</LG>
<P N="8"><HI>VIII. Lord,</HI></P>
<P>I have Learn't by long Experience, that the best of means can do me no Good without thee.</P>
<P>I Believe, that JEHOVAH, the Creator of the Ends of the Earth, can do all Things. Nothing is too hard for thee. Therefore, thou canst cure me yet, that have been so long Incurable.</P>
<P>Thou art All-Gracious. Therefore I believe, there is Goodness enough in thee, to move thee to do such a Great Work, for a most unworthy Sinner; Enough in JESUS CHRIST, though no Goodness in <HI>me,</HI> to move thee.</P>
<P>I own my utter unworthiness &amp; Vileness; and therefore I Justify thee, if thou never do it for me.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="001212_0049_0FB13225DD3F1B38"/>I therefore beg humble Submission to thy Sove∣reign &amp; Holy will in the Event; That I may not Repine, or be Discontented, tho' things go cross to my Desire. Help me to put my month in the Dust, and say, <HI>Not my will, but the Lords will be done</HI>!</P>
<P>Nevertheless, if for thine own Names Sake it may please thee to grant me my Suit; Mans Ex∣tremity is Gods Opportunity, and makes for the Advancement of Gods Power &amp; Grace. Oh! Therefore be <HI>Seen in the Mount!</HI></P>

<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> AT the Lords-Table, after some Serious Preparation of my Heart for that Ordi∣nance, I found much of Christs presence enabling me▪ to Desire &amp; heartily to close with whole CHRIST, in all His Offices, for my Saviour, who there offered to bestow His Broken Body upon me, and His Blood poured out, for the taking away of my Sins. I knew, God was <HI>Real,</HI> in giving His dear Son; And Christ <HI>Real</HI> in bestowing Himself upon me; And I was <HI>Really</HI> willing to accept of Him upon Gods Terms; For I was <HI>Really</HI> Sensible of my absolute Need of Him, and Perishing con∣dition

without Him. I came not thither for Bo∣dily Refreshment, but Spiritual; Not only to Be∣hold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the Sin of the World, but to Converse with Christ, &amp; feed upon the Flesh &amp; Blood of the Son of God, whose Flesh is Meat indeed, and His Blood Drink indeed; that I might Live by Him Spiritually &amp; Eternally, &amp; might have Life in more abundance; a Life of Comfort, an increase of Grace, and Spiritual Strength. I did therefore Believe, and I do still Believe, (<HI>Lord, Help me to believe more strongly and stedfastly▪</HI>) That JESUS CHRIST is mine, with all His Benefits, as surely as the <HI>Bread</HI> that I eat, and the <HI>Wine</HI> that I drink; &amp; that He will nou∣rish my Soul to Eternal Life.
