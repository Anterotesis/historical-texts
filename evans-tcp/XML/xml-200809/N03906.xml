<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S we are fallen Creatures, and natu∣rally in a lost, and perishing Condi∣tion, the first, and chief Thing that should be thought of by us, and that, which, (if we would act like rea∣sonable Beings) ought in a Manner to swallow up all our other Concerns, is; how, or whereby we may be saved? But who is there of you, but must be sensible that it is something else that takes up the Thoughts, and employs the Enquiries of a buisy World; and that with too many this is the least, and last of their Cares?</P>
<P>BUT then of those that are not without all Man∣ner of Anxiety as to their own Salvation, the Gene∣rality of them appear to be too little concerned for the Salvation of the rest of Mankind. Whereas tho' we are first to look to our own Souls; the divine and heavenly Religion we profess, requires that we
<PB N="6" REF="004806_0004_100E29D556561BF0"/>
don't confine our Regards to our selves, but extend them to others, and express a just Concern, not meer∣ly for their present, but for their future and everlast∣ing Welfare. And accordingly the Words I have now read to you breath the true Spirit and Temper of it.</P>
<P>THE Apostle having been speaking of the Re∣jection of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the Calling of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and being about to discourse farther upon the same Subject, least what he had said, or might say, should seem to proceed from any Disaffection to his Coun∣trymen; he makes a solemn Declaration of his un∣feigned Love to them, and his deep Concern for them. Yea, so great was the Regard he had for them, and so sollicitous was he for their Happiness, that he was almost ready, and willing to forego his own for the sake of it. As in the third Verse of the immediately preceeding Chapter, <HI>For I could wish that my self were accursed from Christ, for my Bre∣thren, my Kinsmen according to the Flesh.</HI> If by wish∣ing himself accursed from Christ, he means that he could be content to be cut off from the Land of the living, as an <HI>Anathema,</HI> or a devoted Person, and to be remov'd out of the World in a most ignominious Manner, would it conduce to their Felicity. Or if he intends that he should be willing to be excom∣municated from the Society of the Faithful, to be separated from their Communion, and even to be ac∣counted as a Heathen Man, and a Publican. That if their best Interests would be promoted by it, he could wish himself no more remembred among the Saints, and his Name blotted out of the Records of the Church: This is a strong Evidence of his Affec∣tion and Regard for them. But then there are some that carry the Expression higher, and suppose that he here means his being really seperated from Christ, and cut off from reaping any Benefit by him. But then they justly observe, that he does not say, I do
<PB N="7" REF="004806_0005_100E29D711E17BF0"/>
<HI>wish,</HI> but <HI>could wish my self accursed from Christ.</HI> As we are wont to say, when we would express a Thing to the Heigth which is not fit, nor intended to be done by us: I could wish even so, or so: I could be content to do this, or that. So, when the Apostle thus expresses himself, they conceive it to be as much as if he had said, So great is my Concern for my Countrymen the <HI>Jews,</HI> that were it proper, and would it prevail to the procuring of their Salvation, I could be willing to undergo the greatest of Evils, and almost to wish my own Destruction for the sake of it. So that the Apostle may be consider'd as giving us the Sense of what he had before said, and as repeating much the same Thing, when he makes this solemn Declaration, and says, <HI>My Heart's Desire and Prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.</HI></P>
<P>IN speaking to these Words there are two Things that I would take Notice of, and briefly say some∣thing to.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE vast Worth and Importance of the Be∣nefit, and Blessing here spoken of, <HI>viz.</HI> The being saved. And,</P>
<P N="2">II. THE vehement Desire the Apostle had that others might be Partakers of it.</P>
<P N="1">I. I AM to take Notice of the vast Worth, and Importance of the Benefit, and Blessing here spoken of, <HI>viz.</HI> The being saved. When the Apostle was about to give the strongest and fullest Evidence that possibly he could of his good Will to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, how does he express it, but by his Desire that they might be saved? Plainly intimating, that nothing else would be so advantageous, or was of so much Moment to them: And it is certainly of equal Importance to all. This being not the Thing that I had chiefly in View in discoursing from the Words, I shall say but little to it at present.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004806_0006_100E29DCB6C70E58"/>BY the being saved, I here mean the being saved from the Wrath and Curse of God, and the Miseries consequent upon it. This is what by the Sin of <HI>Adam,</HI> and our own actual Sin, we have fallen under. But as there is a Possibility of Salvation by Jesus Christ, it is a Thing of the utmost Consequence that we attain to it. It is of very great Importance to us that we be saved at Death: That our Souls when they put off these Earthly Tabernacles, may be de∣liver'd from falling into the Hands of Devils: That they may escape that Place and State of Torment that is prepared and reserved for the separate Spirits of the Wicked, and go to associate with the pure and perfected Spirits of the Just. And then it is of great Importance to us that we be saved at the final Judgment, and general Dissolution. We are told of a Day that is approaching when our <HI>Lord shall descend from Heaven in flaming Fire to take Vengeance on them that know not God, and obey not his Gospel:</HI> When <HI>the Heavens shall pass away with a great Noise, and the Elements melt with fervent Heat; when the Earth, and the Works that are there∣in shall be burnt up.</HI> And if we look for such Things, must it not be a Thing of great Concernment to every one, that when this Day of the Lord shall come, they may be found of him in Peace? Will it not be a fearful Thing to be then disowned and re∣jected by him? O! What will become of you, when being doom'd to everlasting Fire, you find your selves surrounded with merciless Flames, and being cast out of the Divine Protection, have no where to flee? How inconceivably wretched will be your Case, when you find your selves cut off from the Prospect of present Deliverance, and from any Hopes of future Release?</P>
<P>OF what vast Importance is it then now to pro∣vide a Place of Refuge and Shelter against that great and terrible Day; that so you may be accounted
<PB N="9" REF="004806_0007_100E29DF60726968"/>
worthy to escape these Things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man? That whilst others are cast into outer Darkness, and left to dwell with everlasting Burnings, you may be caught up to the Heaven of Heavens, may take up your Residence with God, and blessed Spirits in those Realms of uninterrupted Light, and your Body and Soul be possessed of compleat and perfect Blessedness for ever and ever.</P>
<P>ALL this, and much more is included in the Salva∣tion spoken of in the Text. It must needs then be a rich and valuable Blessing, and a Thing of the greatest Importance to attain to it.</P>
<P>AND now if it be so, why should we any of us wonder, and now can we think it strange, that Per∣sons are so deeply anxious as they sometimes are, about their own Salvation? Such is the Importance of the Thing; so much more difficult is it than many are aware of to attain to it; so strait is the Gate, and so narrow the Way that leads to it, and so few there be that find it: In a Word, such is the Danger of coming short of it, and so dismal the Thought of miscarrying, and of being lost for ever, that there is not the least Room to admire, that those that are in the due Exercise of their Intellectual Powers should be under great Concern, and in deep Distress of Soul, till they have a good and comfortable Hope, and Prospect of it.</P>
<P>BUT on the other Hand, what Reason have we to stand amazed at the Carelesness and Security of the greater Part of Mankind? Were we to argue from the Behaviour of the Generality of the Sons and Daughters of Men, we should be apt to conclude that their Salvation was a Thing of but very little Conse∣quence, and be almost ready to think it a Matter of Indifferency to them, whether they are saved, or whe∣ther they are damned. They have commonly very fearful Apprehensions of Poverty and Contempt, and
<PB N="10" REF="004806_0008_100E29E38F7B8040"/>
the other Inconveniencies and Mischiefs they are liable to in this Life, and take a great deal of Pains to secure themselves from them: But they seem to be no ways afraid of Hell, or of the endless and inconcei∣vable Miseries of another Life, and take hardly any Thought or Care that they may escape them. O! the lamentable Blindness and Stupidity of the Sons of Men. Wilt thou be pleased infinitely good God, to open their Eyes? Awaken their sleepy, dead Souls; shew them the Dangers that surround them; make them to see of what Importance it is to be saved; and then they'll give all Diligence to work out their own Salvation; and not only so, but will be doing all they can to promote the Salvation of all that are near to them. And so I come to the</P>
<P N="2">II. Thing that I took Notice of, and am to say something to, from the Words, <HI>viz.</HI> The Apo∣stle's vehement Desire that others might be Partakers of the great and important Blessing he here speaks of. <HI>Brethren,</HI> says he, <HI>my Heart's Desire and Prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.</HI> And in shewing himself thus earnestly desirous of the Sal∣vation of others, he is to be consider'd as a Pattern to Christians in all succeeding Ages, and as well wor∣thy of their Imitation. We are all then to take Ex∣ample from him in manifesting our selves earnestly desirous of the Salvation of others. And here I shall say, 1st, Whose Salvation are we thus earnestly to desire. 2. How and in what Way we are to manifest our selves desirous of it. 3. Whence or upon what Account we are to do it: And then conclude with some proper Use of the whole.</P>
<P>HERE then I am briefly to say,</P>
<P N="1">1. WHO they are whose Salvation we are thus earnestly to desire. And in general, we are to desire the Salvation of all, without excepting any of the whole humane Race.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004806_0009_100E29E673F68938"/>GOD made of one Blood all Nations of Men for to dwell on the Face of the Earth. We had all one Father, and partake of one and the same Nature; and therefore however distinguish'd into different Lan∣guages or Religions, we are to be sollicitous for the everlasting Happiness one of another. There are none of the Posterity of <HI>Adam,</HI> of whatever Nation or Complexion, but may be said to be our Brethren; and therefore it should be our Heart's Desire, if it were the Will of God, that they may be saved: We are to desire with the Psalmist, <HI>Psal.</HI> 67.2. <HI>That God's Way may be known in the Earth, and his saving Health among all Nations.</HI> That they that are Stran∣gers to the great Salvation that God reveals and offers in his Gospel may be made acquainted with it. And that they that have the Overtures and Tenders of it, may accept of them and close with them. And so I proceed to say, that tho' we are to wish the Salva∣tion of all, there are some whose Salvation we are in a more especial Manner to desire. And</P>
<P N="1">1. WE are especially to desire the Salvation of those that are not only of the same Nature, but of the same Faith and Religion with us.</P>
<P>BY those of the same Religion with us, I don't here mean those only that are exactly of the same Opinion, or of our own Party and Perswasion; but all that own the same common Faith, that profess the same Christian Doctrine; all that are of the Church or Israel of God in general; all that as the Apostle expresses it, in every Place call on the Name of Jesus Christ our Lord; both theirs, and ours; to whom he wishes Grace, Mercy, and Peace from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1st Chap. 2d Verse. And thus far are we all oblig'd to extend our good and charitable Wishes; even to all our Christian Brethren, however they may be divided into different Parties and Opinions, and
<PB N="12" REF="004806_0010_100E29E934A1F408"/>
distinguish'd by various Denominations: It should be our Heart's Desire concerning them all, that they may be saved.</P>
<P>AGAIN, in the next Place, Christians should yet more especially wish this Blessing to those that are peculiarly near and dear to them, either on the Ac∣count of the special Relation they stand in to them, or any Benefits they have conferred upon them. You are to be sollicitous not only for the temporal, but for the spiritual and everlasting Welfare of Husbands and Wives; of Parents and Children; of Brethren and Sisters; of Benefactors and Friends that are as your own Souls. Brethren, it should be your Heart's Desire for them that they may be saved. You are indeed to wish well to the spiritual and eternal Inte∣rests of Strangers, and even of Enemies; to bless them that curse you; to do good to them that hate you; to pray for them that despitefully use and per∣secute you. But tho' your greatest Persecutors, and bitterest Enemies are not to be excluded from your kind Wishes, there is no Doubt but that your near Friends are peculiarly entitled to them.</P>
<P>AND then I may add once more, that Christians should in a very peculiar Manner desire the Salvation of those of their own immediate Houshold. If he that provides not for his own, especially for those of his own House, upon temporal Accounts, and takes no Care for the Supply of their bodily Wants, meets with so sharp a Reproof from the Apostle, of how much severer Censure shall he be thought worthy, who neglects their eternal Interests, and cares not what becomes of their precious and immortal Souls. Whom∣soever they are that Providence brings into your Fa∣milies and puts under your Care, be they bond or free, white or black, you are to be sollicitous for their Souls Welfare, and to be heartily desirous that they
<PB N="13" REF="004806_0011_100E29EC5936F4C0"/>
may be saved. Having thus hinted to you who they are whose Salvation we are earnestly to desire, I pro∣ceed to say,</P>
<P N="2">2. HOW and in what Way we are to manifest our selves desirous of it. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE are to shew our selves heartily desirous of the Salvation of others, by our fervent Prayers to God for it: This is agreeable to the Apostolick Pattern here in the Text; <HI>My Heart's Desire,</HI> says this divine and inspir'd Writer, he adds, and my <HI>Prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.</HI> The same Apostle elsewhere tells us, that it is the Will of God that Prayers and Intercessions as well as giving of Thanks should be made for all Men.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 1.</NOTE> Accordingly we are to pray for them that <HI>they may be saved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI> We are to beg of God that he would dispel those Clouds of Ignorance and Error that overspread so great a Part of the known World; that <HI>the Nations may be glad and sing for Joy, and that all the Ends of the Earth may see the Salvation of God</HI>; that he would send forth his Light and his Truth; that the Truth, even as it is in Jesus, may be embraced by all that profess his Name; and that all that own the same common Lord and Saviour, may share with us in his saving Benefits.</P>
<P>BUT then we are to be peculiarly earnest and fer∣vent in our Prayers for the Salvation of such as fall under our more immediate Watch and Care; for such as stand in any special Relation, and for all that have been remarkably kind and beneficent to us. As we are especially to desire the Salvation of such, so I say we are with a peculiar Fervency to pray for it: We are to interceed with God for their temporal, but espe∣cially for their eternal Welfare: We are to pray for them as the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> does for <HI>Onesiphorus,</HI> who <HI>was not ashamed of his Bonds, but when he was at Rome
<PB N="14" REF="004806_0012_100E29EE527F7940"/>
sought him out diligently, found him, and oft refreshed him: The Lord grant,</HI> says he, <HI>that he may find Mercy of the Lord in that Day,</HI> 2 Tim. 1.18. Thus should we express our Desires of the Salvation of others, by our fervent Prayers to God for it. And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. WE are to do this by our earnest Endeavours to promote it. If these are wanting, our seeming Desires that they may be saved are but an idle Pretence, and our Prayers nothing more than a vain and empty Shew. If we would make it evident that we heartily desire their Salvation, we must do what we can as we have Opportunity for the Furtherance of it. It will become us to do all that is in our Power, that such as are destitute of the appointed Means of Salva∣tion, may be brought to the Enjoyment of them, and that those that enjoy them, may reap the Benefit in∣tended by them. We are particularly to endeavour the Salvation of such as come under our immediate View and Observation; especially of those we are any ways related to, or concerned with. Do we perceive them to be in the Gall of Bitterness and Bonds of Ini∣quity, and apprehend that if they continue in their present State they are in the Way to Death and Hell, we are not to look upon them with Indifferency and Unconcernedness of Soul; nor barely to behold them with something of Compassion and Concern, and se∣cretly to breath out a Wish on their Behalf; but to labour to convince them of their miserable and dange∣rous Estate, and do what we can that they may be converted and brought out of it: We are to endea∣vour that they may be reclaim'd from their Errors of Practice, and also from their Errors of Judgment, which, tho' they are in a good Measure recover'd from the former, may prove fatal to them: We are parti∣cularly to do what we can to take them off from any mistaken Notion they may be subject to, as to the Terms of their Acceptance with God: To put them
<PB N="15" REF="004806_0013_100E29F3F02FA1E0"/>
upon seeking for Justification only by Faith in the Son of God, by being found in him, and having on his Righteousness; and to guard them against trusting in their own Duties and Performances, which, without Doubt is, and has been the eternal undoing of a great many Souls. This the Text leads me particularly to take Notice of: It being the very Case as to those <HI>Jews</HI> for whom the Apostle expresses so much Con∣cern; and therefore he adds in the very next Words, <HI>I bear them Record that they have a Zeal of God, but not according to Knowledge. For they being ignorant of God's Righteousness, and going about to establish their own Righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the Righteousness of God.</HI> They were very zealous for the Law, and for the ceremonial Observances of it; they were conscientious and scrupulous in complying with them; and were some of them very exact and careful in their Morals: But here was their fatal Mis∣take, that they rested in these Things, and thought hereby to recommend themselves to the Favour of God. And this it's to be feared is the Error of a great many profess'd Christians at this Day: They have some sort of Zeal for God, tho' not according to Knowledge: They make a considerable Stir with re∣spect to the Circumstantials of Religion: They con∣tend with a great deal of Warmth about outward Modes and Forms; some one Way, and others the Reverse: They come before God as his People, and observe all the stated Seasons of his publick Worship: They abound in external Performances, and are civi∣liz'd in their Lives and Manners; and upon these Things they depend to procure them Acceptance with God. But if there be any of you that have no other Foundation for your Hope, it will assuredly <HI>be cut off, and your Trust be as the Spider's Web.</HI> Upon Enquiry you'll find that the Pharisees did as much as this, and yet our Saviour expressly tells us, <HI>that our Righteous∣ness must exceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and
<PB N="16" REF="004806_0014_100E29F6E289D3D0"/>
Pharisees, or we shall in no Case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>WE are therefore in endeavouring the Salvation of others, to do all we can to bring them to a humble Sense of the Insufficiency of any Works or Righte∣ousness of their own; to put them upon a cordial Ac∣ceptance of Christ, and an entire Reliance upon him, who, as the Apostle tells us in the Context, <HI>is the End of the Law for Righteousness to every one that be∣lieveth.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus you have briefly heard how and in what Way we are to evidence and express our Desires of the Salvation of others. And so I pass to the</P>
<P N="3">3d. THING proposed; which was to say, Whence or upon what Account we should do it. And to pass over this Head in two or three brief Hints, we should heartily desire and earnestly endeavour the Salvation of others,</P>
<P N="1">1. OUT of Love to God, and from a Regard to his Glory, which is so much concern'd in it. He is the most amiable and excellent of Beings, and pos∣sess'd of all imaginable Perfections consider'd in him∣self: And how vast has been his Bounty and Benefi∣cence to us? He is the Author of our Beings; to him we are indebted for what we are, and for all that we have or hope for; He ought therefore to be the supream Object of our Love, and consequently his Glory should be our highest Aim, and what we should be ever sollicitous to promote. And wherein is the Glory of God more advanced than in the Salvation of Sinners? As his infinite Wisdom has pitch'd upon such a Way for the Accomplishment of it, that it may be brought to pass without the least Reproach to any one of his Attributes; so his Mercy and Grace will be herein highly exalted, and unspeakable Ho∣nour will redound to his Name. Since then the Glory
<PB N="17" REF="004806_0015_100E29FC61287AC8"/>
of God will be so far promoted by the Salvation of others, upon this Account we should desire it, pray for it, and do all we can in order to it. Again,</P>
<P><HI>Nextly.</HI> We are heartily to desire and earnestly to endeavour the Salvation of others in meer Love and Compassion to them. One of the two great Com∣mandments on which hang all the Law and the Pro∣phets is, That <HI>we love the Lord our God with all our Heart, with all our Soul, our Strength, and Mind.</HI> And the other is, that we <HI>love our Neighbour as our selves.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 22.37, 38, 39.</NOTE> And if we have any real Affection for our Fellow-Creatures, if we have any Bowels and Mercies, when we look upon them as fallen from God, when we consider the sad and unhappy State to which they are hereby reduc'd, and the amazing and never-ending Torments, which unless they are brought out of it, must unavoidably be their Portion, we must needs behold them with Compassion, and it can't well chuse but be our hearty Desire, our fervent Prayer, and earnest Endeavour that they may be saved.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P>ONCE more. We are taught by a great many Scripture Precepts and Examples, to express our hear∣ty Desires of the Salvation of others: It is included in the great Commandment before-mention'd, of <HI>loving our Neighbour as our selves.</HI> The Scriptures are full of Injunctions to this Purpose. And then, how many excellent Patterns of this Nature are there exhibited to our View? Particularly we have the Example of JESUS the High Priest of our Profession to induce us to it. From whence was it but from a Regard to the Salvation of Men, that he came down from Heaven, that he was made Flesh, and dwelt among us? And whilst here, with what unwearied Diligence did he prosecute this great and noble De∣sign? And as he was content to live a miserable Life,
<PB N="18" REF="004806_0016_100E29FE0AC42A20"/>
he willingly submitted to a shameful and painful Death for the sake of it. And then I might men∣tion the Apostles of our Lord; particularly the great Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> whose Words I am discour∣sing from. How willing was he to spend and be spent for the Good of Souls? How ready to become all Things to all Men, if so be he might save some? What Labours and Perils did he go through? How far was he from counting his Life dear to him, how freely did he part with the most valuable of his temporal Interests for the sake of promoting the Cause in which he was engag'd? We see then that in desiring and doing what we can to promote the Salvation of others, we imitate the greatest and best Examples; and upon this Account it becomes us to do it.</P>
<P>HAVING thus briefly illustrated and confirm'd the Observation here laid down, I proceed to make some Use of it. 1. By way of Instruction. 2. Of Re∣proof and Correction. And 3. Of Exhortation.</P>
<P N="1">I. WHAT has been said may be profitable for our Instruction. And we may hence learn something of the excellent and generous Nature of the Christian Religion. So far is it from countenancing that Nar∣rowness of Spirit that discovers itself among so many of its Professors, that nothing has a greater Tendency to ennoble Men's Minds, and to inspire them with Largeness of Heart. And when it is heartily em∣brac'd, and has its due Influence, it teaches Men to look upon the Happiness of others in a great Mea∣sure as their own, and as such, to wish it and seek after it. Who that thinks of this Religion freely and without Prejudice, can chuse but see it to be be∣coming its blessed Author, and like him, to be <HI>alto∣gether lovely?</HI> The more closely we view it, and the better we are acquainted with it, the more sensible we shall be of its Charms, and the greater Beauties we shall discover in it. How can we enough admire
<PB N="19" REF="004806_0017_100E2A011C3AAB58"/>
this holy and heavenly Doctrine, or be sufficiently thankful for it? How much does it become us that profess it, to take Care that we don't debase and dis∣honour it, but that by a becoming Temper and Be∣haviour we exhibit the Amiableness and Excellency of it? And then,</P>
<P N="2">II. WHAT has been now offered may be profita∣ble for Reproof and Correction: And that as to several Sorts of Persons.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY must needs stand corrected, and deserve very severely to be rebuked, who instead of wishing the Salvation of others, are imprecating the contrary upon them. And how many such are there even among those that wear the Christian Name? How many, who with the same Mouth, wherewith <HI>they are,</HI> or should be <HI>blessing God, even the Father, are cursing Men made after the Similitude of God,</HI> and cal∣ling upon him to damn them for ever? How can we chuse but stand amazed, that any who sustain the Character of rational Beings, especially who profess themselves Christians, should suffer such horrid Lan∣guage to proceed out of their Mouths? Certainly when they thus express themselves, they are not aware of what Damnation means, nor do they consider what they say. But this is far from being a sufficient Ex∣cuse, that when they make use of these Terms, they don't fix any Ideas to them, and that they don't in∣tend what the Words import in the strict and literal Acceptation of them. Must it not be highly affron∣tive to the Divine Majesty for any thus solemnly to invoke him upon these Occasions, and then to pre∣tend that they have no Meaning in it? Is it not a vile Prostitution and horrid Abuse of the great and terrible Name which the Angels so highly reverence and adore, and at which the very Devils can't forbear trembling, for Persons to toss it about in their com∣mon

and ordinary Converse, to no other Purpose but to fill up the Vacancies of their idle Discourse? Is it not a direct Violation of the Letter of his Law, and a horrid Contempt and bold Defiance of his Ven∣geance? And besides at the Time of their uttering this inhuman Language, their hellish Passions are sometimes raised to that Heigth, that was it in their Power they would willingly inflict the worst of Mise∣ries upon those that are the Objects of their Rage. All then that allow themselves in this profane Cur∣sing, must needs be highly worthy of Rebuke. And then,</P>
<P>NEXTLY, They likewise fall under Censure, and are justly liable to a Reproof, who are one Way or other a Means of obstructing the Salvation of others, which it may be feared is the Case with too many professed Christians at this Day. Men's wicked and profane Imprecations upon others, have no direct Tendency to obstruct their Salvation, tho' without a deep Repentance they'll be a Bar to their own. Their wishing one's Misery and Destruction will be no ways conducive to it: <HI>For as the Bird by wan∣dring, and the Swallow by flying, so the Curse causeless shall not come,</HI> Prov. 26.2. But there are many other Ways whereby Men may be instrumental of each other's Ruin, and are often a Means of leading one another into those Practices that not only prove pernicious in this World, but issue in their everlasting Misery and Perdition in the next. But how directly contrary is this to the true Spirit and Temper of a Christian, and what a sad Account will they have to give up when their Lord shall come and reckon with them? Should any of you be found thus guilty, how will you be able to acquit your selves from the Blood of those who by your bad Counsels, ill Examples, or any other Ways, you have help'd forward in the Way to Ruin? What will you do, when not only
<PB N="21" REF="004806_0019_100E2A07A01DFC20"/>
God and your own Consciences shall accuse and con∣demn you, but when this and that Person shall rise up in Judgment against you; yea, it may be some that were nearly related to you, perhaps the Children of your own Bowels, and lay their eternal Ruin to your Charge? How fearfully will this add to your Account, aggravate your Doom, and enhanse your Misery for ever? And then,</P>
<P>ONCE more, They are worthy of Reproof, who if they do nothing that has a direct Tendency to obstruct the Salvation of others, are yet careless and indifferent about it, and unconcern'd what becomes of them for ever. And this seems to be too generally the Case with those that call themselves Christians at this Day. They are too much of the Spirit and Temper of <HI>Cain:</HI> If Actions speak as they certainly do, we can't but hear one and another of them saying as he does, <HI>Gen.</HI> 4.9. <HI>Am I my Brother's keeper?</HI> Is it any thing to me what becomes of him? They seldom, if ever, look beyond themselves; they take but little Thought for the temporal, and less for the spiritual and eternal Good of their Neighbour; it seems to be much the same Thing to them whither he be sav'd, or whether he perish; whether he be happy, or whether he be miserable for ever. But such are certainly of a very different Disposition from that which the Apostle expresses here in the Text: They are void of that Compassion which the Reli∣gion they profess so strongly recommends, are Stran∣gers to the Power of it, and very justly fall under Censure. And then a</P>
<P N="3">III. and last Use of what has been said is by Way of Exhortation. 1. If you have not yet done it, to secure your own Salvation. And 2. To express a sincere and hearty Concern for the Salvation of others.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="004806_0020_100E2648C21D2728"/>IN the first Place, my beloved Brethren, let me earnestly exhort you, if you have not yet secur'd your own Salvation, that you would now exert your selves in order to it. And here I would first, offer a Word or two to such as are yet so senseless and stupid as to take little or no Thought or Care that you may be saved. And let me ask such of you, how you can possibly be easy in a natural State, and what it is that encourages you in your present Secu∣rity? Do you not think your Salvation a Thing of any Importance, and that it is worthy of your Con∣cern? Do but think seriously what must be the Con∣sequence of coming short of it, and what it is to un∣dergo the Damnation of Hell, and you'll soon be convinced of the contrary, and see all your other In∣terests to be but perfect Trifles, and to vanish into nothing, when compar'd with it. Or do you think it is a Thing so easily obtain'd, that there is no great Care or Pains requir'd in order to it? Do but im∣partially survey the Scriptures from first to last, and you'll find it to be a Mistake. Nay, if you do no∣thing more than consult the Words of our blessed Saviour himself, you'll be convinced that you have a great deal to do in order to your being saved: That if you ever enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, you must press and force your Way into it; and that there is great Hazard of your coming short of it. Or is this the Ground of your Security, that it is Time enough to set about this Business as yet, and that you may safely put it off till hereafter? O that you would think seriously of your own Frailty, and consider how soon your Time of Life, or Day of Grace may come to an End, and from hence you'll soon see your Error. Is there any one of you that enjoys the most confirm'd State of Health, or that is flourishing in the Vigour of Youth, who can tell but this Night his Soul may be requir'd of him; and but that before another Day his Opportunity of secu∣ring
<PB N="23" REF="004806_0021_100E2A0D4115A620"/>
his Salvation may be at an End? What meanest thou then, O Sleeper, arise and call upon thy God? O that all of you, young and old, or in the midst of your Days, would awake out of your Stupidity; that you would now resolve, with a humble Dependance upon God's Grace, to be more concern'd for your Souls than you have ever yet been. <HI>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trembling, for it is God that worketh in you to will and to do of his good Plea∣sure.</HI> As it is now a Time when a great many are under a serious and deep Concern for their Souls, one would think you should be afraid of missing this Season, lest you be left in your Security and be lost for ever. I would hope there are none here pre∣sent that scoff at this Work of Conviction, or that make Light of it. If they do, it is because they are unacquainted with the Scriptures, and with the usual Way of Sinners being brought home to God. Con∣sider how those that were converted by the Ministry of the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> were first pricked at the Heart, and in the deepest Agony cried out, <HI>Men and Bre∣thren, what shall we do.</HI> Consider how it was with the Jaylor that came trembling to <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI>; and how it was with the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> himself, who trembled and cried out, <HI>What wilt thou have me to do?</HI> And consider what our Saviour himself says of the Office of the Holy Spirit, that when he was come he should <HI>reprove,</HI> or convince <HI>the World of Sin.</HI> And how is it possible you should think strange of this Work? And whoever of you expect Salva∣tion without experiencing some Degree or other of it, you will doubtless find your selves deceived. But then I would offer a Word or two to such of you as are under a deep and distressing Concern for your Souls, (which I trust is the Case with some of you) who are full of trembling, and are ready with the Jaylor before mentioned to cry out, <HI>What shall</HI> we <HI>do to be saved?</HI> And how can I better reply than
<PB N="24" REF="004806_0022_100E2A10A6CE3058"/>
in the Words of the Apostle, <HI>Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved.</HI> He calls upon you to come to him for Life and Salvation; and what is it that prevents your coming? Is it because your Sins have been so many and great? If you are but truly sen∣sible of them, this need be no Hindrance to it; No, if you are weary and heavy laden, you are the very Persons he invites to come, and whom he expresly promises upon your so doing, that you shall find Rest for your Souls. Come then to him as your only and almighty Saviour, and don't cease seeking and pray∣ing till you have such a Sight of his suitableness and sufficiency, as heartily to embrace him, and to venture your Souls in his Hands: Then being found in him you'll be safe and secure. And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. LET me exhort and perswade you, having se∣cur'd your own Salvation, to express a sincere and hearty Desire for the Salvation of others. Be much in Prayer to God for it, and not only so, but be sure to use your best Endeavours to promote it. There are doubtless some whose Happiness ought to be very near your Heart. This as has been hinted to you, is the Case of all that stand in any near Relation to you; accordingly be exhorted in an especial Manner to lay out your selves for the Salvation of such. Be particularly sollicitous for those of your own House∣hould. Let not those that serve with you, no not your poor Negroes, be excluded from your Care, but be mindful of their poor perishing Souls, and do what you can for them, that they may be saved. But let your dear Children be in a peculiar Manner the Object of your Cares. As it must needs be your Desire and Prayer, so let it be your earnest Endea∣vour, that they may not be lost, but sav'd for ever. To this Purpose be sure daily to pray with them, as well as for them, to instruct them, and faithfully to discharge your Duty to them. But tho' your Charity
<PB N="25" REF="004806_0023_100E2A15264D9290"/>
may and ought to begin at Home, don't let it end there, but extend it to all your Christian Brethren, and even to the whole humane Race, and endeavour to promote the Salvation of all that come within your Reach. You have, Brethren, the Love of God, of Christ, and of your Neighbour to constrain you, and a great many excellent Examples to induce you to it. Yea, you have the Example of no less a Person than the Son of God himself, of the Apostles and primitive Christians, and a great many noble Patterns of a later Date. What was it but an ardent Desire of promoting the Salvation of precious and immortal Souls that induced that faithful Servant of Christ <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev Mr. Gilbert <HI>Tenvent.</HI></NOTE> that visited some of our Towns the Winter past to face these Northern Blasts, to undertake such a Jour∣ney, and to go through such Fatigues in that difficult Season? And as his coming into these Parts was owing to a Motion of Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> I can't but speak of him as a bright and shining Pattern of Zeal for the Salvation of Souls. Had he consulted his Ease, or had Wealth and Preferment been his Aim, it's easy to conceive how he could quickly have made his Way to these Things: But he took a Course that he might be sure would be a Bar to his Attainment to them, and that was no likely Way to procure him the Applause of any but the serious and strictly reli∣gious, which are by far the smaller Part of Man∣kind. But the Salvation of Souls was infinitely dearer to him, and this is the Thing that he was desirous at all Hazards to promote. And how won∣derful is it to see one in that Age with such burn∣ing Zeal and unwearied Diligence prosecuting this great Design, and how glorious is the Sight? Did we see one in the prime of his Days freely ventu∣ring his Life and Fortune, and facing the greatest
<PB N="26" REF="004806_0024_100E2A16F7E4D298"/>
Dangers to rescue his Countrymen from the Ravages of a potent Adversary, and to deliver them from the temporal Mischiefs and Miseries which upon that Account they lay open to, it would doubtless gain our Admiration and Esteem. How much more should it do so, to see an intrepid Youth voluntarily engaging in the War betwixt <HI>Michael</HI> and the Dra∣gon, to see him boldly attacking this grand Adver∣sary in his strong Holds, and exposing himself to a continual Scene of Labours and Perils, to rescue poor Souls out of his Hands, to save them from Hell, and to prevent them from being bound in Chains of ever∣lasting Darkness? However it may be look'd upon by Men, it is I am well assur'd a gracious Spectacle in the Sight of GOD and of the blessed Angels. Let us then be thankful for the Examples that have been set us by these Servants of CHRIST, and in∣stead of discovering so base and envious a Disposition as to take any Pains to find out their Failings, and magnify their Imperfections, let us observe and emu∣late their Vertues; and if we can't come up to them, let us follow them, tho' it be at some Distance, in their fervent Desires and earnest Endeavours to further the Salvation of others. Let us not only be careful to avoid every Thing that may obstruct it, but do every Thing within our Power that may be conducive to it. It's certain we can't be employ'd in a Work more noble and honourable in itself, or that will be more advantageous to us; that will yield us greater Satisfaction in this World, or procure us a higher Degree of Glory in the next. <HI>They that be wise,</HI> says the Prophet, <HI>shall shine as the Bright∣ness of the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteousness as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>LET us all then lay out our selves in this Work, and let us be quicken'd to Diligence in it, by con∣sidering
<PB N="27" REF="004806_0025_100E2A1A9932BAB8"/>
that the Season for it is drawing to a Close, and will quickly, we know not how soon, come to an End; remembring the Words of the Lord JESUS, <HI>John</HI> 9.4. <HI>I must work the Works of him that sent me while it is Day, the Night cometh when no Man can work.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN ever this Period shall arrive, may we enter into Rest, and join the blessed Society of Angels and glorified Spirits in singing Songs of Praise to the Lamb, and to him that sitteth on the Throne for ever and ever. AMEN.</P>
