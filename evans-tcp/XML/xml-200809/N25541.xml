<L>How gailey his bark through life's ocean would sail,</L>

<L>That as good as he was, made him all that was bad;</L>
<L>He was paltry, and pitiful, scurvy and mean,</L>
<L>And the sniv'lingest scoundrel that ever was seen;</L>

<L>'Twas once on a time when we took a gal∣leon,</L>
<L>And the crew touched the agent for cash to some tune,</L>
<L>TOM took a trip to jail an old messmate to free,</L>
<L>And four thankful prattlers soon sat on his knee;</L>
<L>Then TOM was an Angel from Heav'n down sent,</L>
<L>While they had hands he his goodness should never repent:</L>

<L>He gave him enough through life's ocean to steer,</L>

<L>His pittance is daily, and yet TOM imparts,</L>

<HEAD>THE EARTHEN JUG.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>OUR trade to work in clay began,</L>
<L>'Ere the first man was made,</L>
<L>For out of clay was made this man,</L>
<L>And thus began our trade:</L>
<L>Then friends put round the foaming mug,</L>

<L>Since man is but an earthen jug,</L>

<L><HI>Return to dust, who wets his clay.</HI></L>

<L>In this the Jemmy Cheapside buck</L>

<L>Or Fleet-Street Miss at Dog and Duck,</L>
<L>May quaff her syllabub:</L>
<L>Or jovial Jack, that jolly dog,</L>
<L>May treat his rosy wench,</L>
<L>And over this, when fill'd with grog,</L>
<L>Sing how he bang'd the French.</L>
<L><HI>And how can he, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>See here a noble christ'ning bowl,</L>
<L>But fill it to the brim,</L>
<L>So large, the baby, pretty soul,</L>
<L>May like young Indian swim:</L>
<L>The Covent-Garden swell at Jupp's</L>
<L>In this may take his go;</L>
<L>For Astley's punch-house here are cups,</L>
<L>Pro bono publico.</L>
<L><HI>And how can he, &amp;c.</HI></L>

<L>The spacious bowl receives a crash,</L>

<L>The toping tradesman gets a crash,</L>

<L>Since, however, I mix with the mad sons of earth.</L>
<L>They cannot deny but I one time had birth.</L>
<L>If no annal, or chronicle, mentions my race,</L>

<LG>
<L>COME, courage, lads, and drink away,</L>
<L>A man upon his wedding day</L>
<L>Ought rarely well his part to play,</L>
<L>At Stingo or October:</L>
<L>For who would be that stupid elf,</L>

<HEAD>TOBY PHILPOT.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>DEAR Sir, this brown jug that now foams with mild ale,</L>
<L>(In which I will drink to sweet Kate of the vale)</L>
<L>Was once Toby Philpot, a thirsty old soul,</L>
<L>As e'er drank a bottle, or fathom'd a bowl;</L>
<L>In boozing about 'twas his praise to excel,</L>
<L>And among jolly topers he bore off the belle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It chanc'd as in dog-days he sat at his ease,</L>
<L>In a flow'r-woven arbour as gay as you please,</L>
<L>With a friend and a pipe puffing sorrow away,</L>
<L>And with honest old stingo was soaking his clay,</L>
<L>His breath-doors of life on a sudden were shut,</L>
<L>And he died full as big at a Dorchester butt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="108" REF="033913_0108_0FF9EA337B693A80"/>
<L>His body, when long in the ground it had lain,</L>
<L>And time into clay had dissolv'd it again,</L>
<L>A potter found out in a covert so snug,</L>
<L>And with part of fat Toby he form'd this brown jug:</L>
<L>Now, sacred to friendship, to mirth, and mild ale,</L>
<L>I'll drink to my lovely sweet Kate of the vale.</L>

<HEAD><HI>OLD AGNES.</HI> (Sequel to Toby Philpot.)</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>My true honest fellows who smoke with such glee,</L>
<L>To beg your attention for once I make free,</L>
<L>And sing of our pipes, while thus merry and snug,</L>
<L>We soften our cares as we lighten our jug;</L>
<L>This jug which from Toby its origin boasts,</L>
<L>Old Toby, whose mem'ry enlivens the toast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Toby's fame like his size, spread so great by his ale,</L>
<L>That for Agnes no room could be found in the tale,</L>
<L>Honest Agnes, the social support of his life,</L>
<L>Both for quaffing and size was well pair'd as his wife;</L>
<L>Therefore singing her praise, we with joy will regale,</L>
<L>Whilst our pipes and our jug give a zest to our ale.</L>

<PB N="109" REF="033913_0109_0FF9EA368AA84580"/>
<L>The potter, who shrewdly found Toby's re∣mains,</L>
<L>Thought to visit again there might answer his pains,</L>
<L>Where, in brief, he found Agnes, whose death, as her life,</L>
<L>Made her qualify'd duly to lie as his wife:</L>
<L>Her fair fame all the village incessantly quote,</L>
<L>Whose Vicar the following epitaph wrote.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Agnes Philpot, the wife of old Toby, re∣nown'd,</L>
<L>"Who liv'd whilst on earth, now lies dead in this ground,</L>
<L>"The care of her grieving for Toby to bilk,</L>
<L>"She soften'd her sorrows with brandy and milk,</L>
<L>"Swoln with silky, she thriv'd 'till her skin gave a crack</L>
<L>"When death popping in laid her here on her back."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At these lines our good potter a happy thought started,</L>
<L>That Toby and Agnes should never be parted;</L>
<L>So he took of her clay which was white as her milk,</L>
<L>And temper'd with brandy 'till softer than silk,</L>
<L>Then forming these pipes, he advis'd sly and snug,</L>
<L>That we kiss her fair clay, and shake hands with his jug.</L>

<L>'TWAS past meridian half past four,</L>
<L>By signal I from Nancy parted;</L>
<L>At six she linger'd on the shore,</L>
<L>With uplift hands, and broken hearted:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At seven, while taughtening the fore-stay,</L>
<L>I saw her faint, or else 'twas fancy;</L>
<L>At eight we all got under way,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Night came on, and now eight bells had rung,</L>
<L>While careless sailors, ever cheary,</L>
<L>On the mid watch so jovial sung,</L>
<L>With tempers labour cannot weary.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I little to their mirth inclined,</L>
<L>While tender thoughts rush'd on my fancy,</L>
<L>And my warm sighs increas'd the wind.</L>
<L>Look'd on the moon, and thought of Nancy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now arriv'd that jovial night,</L>
<L>When ev'ry true bred tar carouses,</L>
<L>When, o'er the grog, all hands delight</L>
<L>To toast their sweethearts and their spouses.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Round went the can, the jest, the glee,</L>

<L>Next morn a storm came on at four,</L>

<L>Headlong within the foaming ocean.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poor wretches! they soon found their graves,</L>
<L>For me, it may be only fancy,</L>
<L>But love seemed to forbid the waves</L>
<L>To snatch me from the arms of Nancy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce the foul hurricane was clear'd,</L>
<L>Scarce winds and waves had ceased to rattle,</L>
<L>When a bold enemy appear'd,</L>
<L>And, dauntless, we prepared for battle.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now, while some lov'd friend or wife,</L>
<L>Like lightning, rush'd on every fancy,</L>
<L>To Providence I trusted life,</L>
<L>And put up a prayer, and thought on Nancy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At last, 'twas in the month of May,</L>
<L>The crew, it being lovely weather,</L>
<L>At three, A. M. discovered day,</L>
<L>And England's chalky cliffs together.</L>

<L>These Kegs now hold the rebels bold,</L>
<L>Pack'd up like pickled herring:</L>
<L>And they're come down t'attack the town</L>
<L>In this new way of ferrying.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The soldier flew, the sailor too,</L>
<L>And, scar'd almost to death, sir,</L>
<L>Wore out their shoes, to spread the news,</L>
<L>And ran till out of breath, sir.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now up and down, throughout the town,</L>
<L>Most frantic scenes were acted;</L>
<L>And some ran here, and some ran there</L>

<L>Awak'd by such a clatter:</L>
<L>He rub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both eyes, and boldly cries,</L>
<L>"For God's sake what's the matter?"</L>

<HEAD>VICAR AND MOSES.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THERE was once, it was said, when, is out of my head,</L>
<L>And where too; yet true is my tale,</L>
<L><PB N="164" REF="033913_0164_0FF9C5CB49263190"/>That a round belly'd vicar, bepimpled with liquor,</L>
<L>Could stick to no text like good ale,</L>
<L>Tol de rol, de rol, lol lol lol lol.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He one night 'gan to dose; for, under the rose,</L>
<L>The parson was then <HI>non se ipse:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Non se ipse!</HI>—you'll say, What's that to the lay?</L>
<L>In plain English, the parson was tipsy.</L>
<L>His clerk, stopping in, with a band bobbin chin,</L>
<L>As solemn and stupid as may be;</L>
<L>The vicar he gap'd; the clerk hemm'd and scrap'd,</L>
<L>Saying, Please, Sir, to bury a baby.</L>
<L>Now our author supposes, the clerk's name was Moses,</L>
<L>He look'd, like his master, so rosy;</L>
<L>Who blink'd with one eye, with his wig all awry,</L>
<L>And hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cap'd—Pray how is it Mosy?</L>
<L>A child, S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r is carry'd, by you to be hury'd.—</L>
<L>Bury me▪ Moses! no, that won't do.—</L>
<L>Lord, Sir! said the clerk, you are all in the dark;</L>
<L>'Tis a child to be bury'd, not you.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well, Moses, don't hurry; the infant we'll bury.—</L>
<L>But, master, the corpse cannot stay.—</L>
<L>Well, can it? but why? for once, then we'll try</L>
<L>If a corpse, Moses, can run away.</L>
<L><PB N="165" REF="033913_0165_0FF9EB7118A8F918"/>But Moses reply'd:—Sir, the parish will chide,</L>
<L>For keeping them out in cold weather.—</L>
<L>Then Moses, quoth he, go and tell them from me,</L>
<L>I'll bury them warm all together.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, Sir, it rains hard; pray have some re∣gard.—</L>
<L>Regard, Moses! that makes me stay:</L>
<L>For no corpse, young or old, in rain can catch cold;</L>
<L>But, faith, Moses, you and I may.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Moses begg'd he'd be gone, saying, Sir, the rain's done;</L>
<L>Please to rise, and I'll lend you my hand.—</L>
<L>Oh! 'tis hard, quoth the vicar, to leave thus my liquor,</L>
<L>And go where I'm sure I can't stand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then the parson sore troubled, to the church∣yard he hobbied,</L>
<L>Lamenting the length of the way;</L>
<L>For, Moses, quoth he, were I a bishop, d'ye see,</L>
<L>I neither need walk, preach nor pray.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When he came to the grave, says he—Moses, a stave.</L>
<L>Lord! Where's my tobacco box hid?</L>
<L>I declare this fast walking prevents me from talking;</L>
<L>So, Moses, pray give me a quid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="166" REF="033913_0166_0FF9C5D2B9367430"/>
<L>Then he open'd the book, and in't seem'd to look:</L>
<L>But o'er th page only he squinted:—</L>
<L>Says he, Moses, I'm vex'd, for I can't find the text.</L>
<L>The book is so damnably printed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Good people, let's pray. Life's, alas! but a day;</L>
<L>Nay sometimes 'tis over at noon;</L>
<L>Man is but a flower, cut down in an hour:</L>
<L>'Tis strong ale, Mosy, does it so soon.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Woman of a man born—no, that's wrong, the leaf's torn?</L>
<L>Upon woman the natural swell is;</L>
<L>The world would grow wild, were men got with child:</L>
<L>Moses, you and I might have big bellies!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Neigbours, mind what I say, when 'tis night 'tis not day,</L>
<L>Though in former times saints could work wonders;</L>
<L>For, cut off your head, in a trice, it is said,</L>
<L>They'd replace it without any blunders.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, let us go forth; put the child in the earth;</L>
<L>Dust to dust Moses, dust is away;</L>
<L>For Moses, I trust we all should be dust,</L>
<L>If we were nor to moisten our clay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So one pot, and then—the clerk said, Amen.</L>
<L>And thus we have carried the farce on.</L>

<HEAD>MASONIC TOASTS.</HEAD>
<P>MAY universal Masonry be the only universal monarchy—and reign triumphant in the hearts of the worthy.</P>
<P>May the tongue of every mason be the key of his heart: may it eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hang in just equilibrium —and never be suffered to lie, to injure a brother.</P>
<P>May every mason's heart have the ardency of char∣coal, and the freedom of chalk—but not the coldness or hardness of marble, when the dis∣tresses of a brother claim assistance.</P>
<P>The square in conduct, the level in condition, the plumb-line in rectitude, and the compass in prudence to all masons.</P>
<P>The splendour of the east, the repose of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the solidity of the west, to every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> lodge of free and accepted masons.</P>
<P>May the fragrance of good report, like a sprig of cassia, bloom over the head of every departed brother.</P>
<P>Our sisters—may they have as much reason to ad∣mire our wisdom, as the queen of Sheba had that of our grand master Solomon.</P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="033913_0277_0FF9ED8669A9B9C8"/>May we be entered apprentices to beauty and fel∣low crafts in love, but still masters of our pas∣sions.</P>
<P>May wisdom contrive our happiness; strength sup∣port our virtuous resolutions; and beauty adorn our beds.</P>
<P>May the rays of celestial li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht pierce through the veil of ignorance, and perseverance remove the key-stone that covers truth.</P>
<P>May the roya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> arch cover every honest mason's heart: and the glory of the first temple over∣shadow all who act up to the true principles of masonry.</P>
