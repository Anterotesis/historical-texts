<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>1 PETER IV. 17, 18, 19.</BIBL>
<P>For the Time is come that Judgment must begin at the House of GOD; and if it first Begin at us, what shall the End be of them that. Obey not the Gospel of GOD! And if the Righteous be scarce∣ly Saved, Where shall the Ʋngodly and Sinner appear? Wherefore let them that suffer according to the Will of GOD, Commit the keeping of their Souls to HIM, in Well-Doing, as unto a Faith∣ful Creator.</P></Q>

<P>THE Great Immanuel, GOD the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is GOD and Man, is, by Delegation from
<PB N="4" REF="001812_0003_0FB83EBCEC1D9FF8"/>
GOD the Father, the Supream Magi∣strate, the Lord of Providence, and Absolute Paramount, Sovereign of the Church and World, Visible and Invi∣sible. In His Government, His Per∣fections of Sovereignty and Power, Wisdom and Goodness, Grace and Holiness, Mercy and Faithfulness, Ju∣stice and Equity, are gloriously Re∣splendent. To strict Justice appertain His Commanding, Rewarding &amp; Pu∣nishing, as a Judge Vindictive: To Grace and Mercy belong His Com∣manding, Rewarding, Punishing, For∣bearing, and Pardoning as a Father; His Dispensations Refer either to the whole World, or to Particular Nati∣ons, Provinces, and Societies, and Fa∣milies, or to Individual Persons. And forasmuch as the Infliction of Punish∣ment upon Multitudes of Sinners of all sorts, at one and the same time or sea∣son; has a Tendency to strike the greater Terrour, and to prevent the more Transgression, &amp; to demonstrate the Lord's most impartial hatred of

Sin; therefore, after seasons of Long-suffering, and general Clemency and Beneficence, the LORD has His Re∣markable Times of Judgment, or of Judicial Dispensation, wherein whole Nations, and all sorts of Persons in them, suffer Tribulation and Calami∣ty; some for their Saving Amend∣ment, and others for their Utter De∣struction. 'Twas such a Time with the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, and with many <HI>Gentiles</HI> also, in the Days of the Em∣perour <HI>Vespasian,</HI> when their Iniquity was full; whereof our Blessed SAVI∣OUR, and His Apostles premonished Them; And in our <HI>Text,</HI> the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> gives 'em most solemn Adver∣tisement,</P>

They shall be cut off from the Earth, and they shall have no Salvati∣on, and Mansion in Heaven, (as the Learned <HI>Piscator</HI> shews, and the course of the <HI>Apostles</HI> Argument strongly im∣ports it;] and therefore in Hell will they lift up their Eyes, being in Tor∣ments, as <HI>Dives,</HI> Luk. 16.

<P>The First Doctrine from this Text that I propose to speak to at this time as God shall help, is this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>¶ 1. That at the Coming of Times of Destroying Judgment upon very wicked Nations, Judgment is wont first to Begin in a Corrective Way, at the House of GOD; and then sometimes, there are such Hours of violent Temptation, and intolerable Oppression and Distress permitted to pass over the best Christians in those Nations, as wherein their Souls are indangered, and their Faith and Holiness put into extream Hazzard, so as very narrowly to Escape an utter Overthrow; and the Difficul∣ty of keeping in the Way to Hea∣ven is made wonderfully great and extraordinary.</P>

<PB N="11" REF="001812_0010_0FB83ECBEC1B5608"/>
of GOD. As good Figs are first pluck∣ed, and welted, and press'd down hard into a Cask, and then the refuse and corrupt Figs are given over to be trampled, devoured, and utterly de∣stroyed. So the Best in <HI>Judah</HI> were first carried Captive into <HI>Caldea</HI> for their Good, and then the incorrigibly Wicked were delivered to the Sword, Famine and Pestilence, to be consu∣med: <HI>Jer.</HI> 24.1,—10. The Cup of Fury is first given to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and then to <HI>Egypt,</HI> and other wicked Nati∣ons: <HI>Jer.</HI> 25.15,—25. &amp; 49.12. GOD's Sanctuary has the first handsel of Judgment: <HI>Ezek.</HI> 9.6. The Lord saith to the Land of <HI>Israel, I will cut off from thee, the Righteous &amp; the VVicked,</HI> Ezek. 21, 3, 4. And first the Righteous are to be cut off, and sent to Heaven, be∣fore the most Ruinous Evil is Inflicted on the Wicked: <HI>Isai.</HI> 57.1. Our LORD Praedicted that the Days of Vengeance and Wrath should come upon the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, to their dread∣ful and horrendous Overthrow; But
<PB N="12" REF="001812_0011_0FB83ECDCE5747A8"/>
that first His Disciples must be hated of all men, and Persecuted. <HI>Luke</HI> 21.10, 11, 12, 22, 23, 24.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>Why is it meet that Judgment should begin Correctively at the House of GOD, and that Regenerate Righteous Men should not be exempted from it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Tho' 'tis not for finite and clouded Understandings, (such as ours are,) to presume over-curiously to search into Heavens Mysteries of Go∣vernment, and Reasons of State; and who can by searching find 'em out unto Perfection? Yet enough being Reveal∣ed, not only to silence Objectors, but to satisfy and ravish the most inquisi∣tive Minds. We shall with Reverence and Humility suggest a few Particu∣lars, by way of Answer to that Enqui∣ry, as to what we scantly apprehend of that Mystery, which in its full lati∣tude, is to us Incomprehensible. We ac∣knowledge, that Mercy is GOD's At∣tribute and Delight, &amp; that the God∣ly are His Favourites; and that <HI>He doth His Work, his strange Work, and

<P N="1">1. They must blame themselves for Provoking it, and that they need such dreadful Severity: They first commit sin before they smart for't; and were they not wofully prone to it, Providence would not plant the Thorn-Hedge, nor draw the Flaming Sword to prevent 'em: Vile Rust first defiles 'em, before GOD's sharp File comes to take it off: The Gold sullies, before 'tis scour'd: The poi∣sonous swelling of the dangerous Tumour, necessitates its painful and bloody Launcing: Bitter Potions must be given to prevent a dangerous Re∣lapse: The Persons of the Godly are freed by JESUS CHRIST, from the Hostile Hatred of GOD; Their guilty Obligation unto Everlasting Punishment and Vengeance, and to all that Evil Temporal and Spiritu∣al that absolutely assures it, is Can∣cell'd
<PB N="14" REF="001812_0013_0FB83ED543A02578"/>
by their <HI>Great Pardon</HI> in their Justification upon their First Union with CHRIST, by the Spirit and Faith; But by their subsequent sin∣ful Excursions, they multiply their guilty Exposedness to suffer Corrective Punishments that may be inflicted on 'em to their smart; not to make any sa∣tisfaction at all to the Absolutely Vin∣dictive Justice of GOD for their Sins, for that's already fully done by the Blood of their Redeemer; but to shew forth His Holiness, and that His Impartial Hatred of Sin, where∣ever He sees it, may shine forth, &amp; that, to the Everlasting Glory of His Grace, Wisdom, and Power, He may wonderfully work, unto the ut∣ter quashing, and subduing of their re∣maining Corruptions, and may pre∣vent their breaking forth, even by the Oppressions and Distresses, that natu∣rally tend to inflame, irritate, and strengthen 'em. Are there two Di∣vine Courts, one of Eternally Vindic∣tive Justice, another of <HI>Fatherly Dis∣cipline,
<PB N="15" REF="001812_0014_0FB83ED676B49F98"/>
and merciful Government?</HI> 'Tis to the latter of 'em that the Saints must Cry for new Pardons for their daily Transgressions, &amp; which before those Pardons are granted, inflicts the Punishments, when Judgment begins at the House of GOD. As after they are obtained, Fatherly Sovereignty yet proves their Patience and other Gra∣ces, with Trials of the first magnitude, sometimes not Paenal, but of Free Grace, to be Recompensed with far more ex∣ceeding and eternal weights of Glory.</P>
<P N="2">2. Yea even proper Corrective Pu∣nishments tho' not Joyous but Grie∣vous, yet serve to prepare 'em for the more Joy. Often where the Lord in∣tends the most Comfort, He ushers it in with the more Sorrow, to prevent surfeiting, and to secure their greater Humility and Thankfulness. The Sorrows of the true Church, are but Travailing Pains to bring forth Tri∣umphs. <HI>Joh.</HI> 16.20, 21. Black Roots bear beautiful Flowers; The prodigi∣ous Fish that swallow'd <HI>Jonah,</HI> brought

him to the Shore: Dark Colours pre∣pare for an Overlaying of Gold: <HI>Ja∣cob</HI> was first Lamed unto Halting, and then Blessed by the ANGEL of the Covenant. The <HI>Cross</HI> in the Covenant makes way for the <HI>Crown.</HI> The Plea∣sures that attend and follow our En∣during of Affliction with the People of GOD, are far more Eligible, than the Pleasures of Sin. The Physician's love to the Patient, gives the Griping Medicines that produce a long &amp; joy∣ful Health. <HI>Whom the LORD loveth, He Chasteneth for their profit, that they may be partakers of His Holiness, without which no man shall see the LORD,</HI> Heb. 12.6, 9, 10, 14. Precious Spice is tho∣rowly pounded, to yield forth its most refreshing Fragrancy &amp; Virtue. Paint∣ers Grind with vile Pebblestones their richest Colours for their most glorious Pictures. Which leads to a Third Consideration.</P>
<P N="3">3. Wicked men the viler they are, are the fitter Instruments, being shar∣pened with Spite and Rage, to cut
<PB N="17" REF="001812_0016_0FB83EDC221C6048"/>
deep gashes in the Godly. The <HI>Assy∣rian,</HI> who was the Rod of GOD's An∣ger, must not be cast into the Fire of destroying Judgment, till the LORD had perform'd his whole work of Cor∣rective Judgment on <HI>Zion,</HI> first of all by his cruel Hand. <HI>Isa.</HI> 10.5.12. There∣fore Judgment first begins at the House of GOD; and the Wicked that often Execute it, are reserved to suffer last, and ripen themselves for suffering by their doing it; their Outrages a∣gainst the Godly, filling up the mea∣sure of their Iniquity, that so Judg∣ment may come upon 'em to the ut∣termost; the Righteousness whereof appears most unexceptionable in that being Warn'd and Advertiz'd of the Impartial Justice of GOD, and His terrible Hatred of Sin, by His Severi∣ty on His People, they yet Sin with the more desperateness; so that to wait any longer for their hopeless Re∣covery were vain. Thus are the Wicked left <HI>without Excuse</HI> in Sinning, and cut off from all Hope of Escaping;
<PB N="18" REF="001812_0017_0FB83EDD292C5FF0"/>
and when they are Destroyed, this clears up the Glory of GOD's Justice, that has put an End to His Patience; They hereby appearing to have been Incorrigible. And if the Exuberances of green Trees must feel the sharp pruning Knife, What shall be done to the dry? The Lord does not spare His own dear Children when they sin, much less will He spare His Enemies. Cannot all the Graces &amp; Good Works of Saints exempt them from sharp Strokes, How then can the Wicked escape? <HI>Prov.</HI> 11.31. Well, 'tis meet that the Wicked do their Work be∣fore they receive their Wages, &amp; that they fulfil GOD's Designs, tho' be∣sides their own Intention. <HI>Isai.</HI> 10.7. And that they have the Warning, tho' they will not take it, and that their mouths be stop'd, but not their Exe∣cution▪ therefore Judgment first be∣gins at the House of GOD, though it ends in their Ruine only.</P>

come upon the Godly, in Judicial Times, as fence up their Way to Hea∣ven, with terrible Difficulties &amp; Dan∣gers; so that they are scarcely saved. Verily, the way of Christianity, which is the only way that leads to Eternal Life, even in the times that are not Judicial, is strait and difficult, and li∣ned with dangers. <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.13, 14. <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.24. and few there be that find it; and they who find it, find it very hard to keep it. <HI>It lyes in a Mystery.</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16. <HI>The Right Eye must be Pluckt out, and Hand and Foot Cut off, if ever men enter into Life.</HI> Mat. 18.8, 9.

The Way to Life is not unfitly compared to the Way of the Chil∣dren of <HI>Israel</HI> from <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Canaan,</HI> which was thro' the Sea, and thro' a vast and howling Wilderness, a Land of fiery flying Serpents, Rocks, Sands,
<PB N="20" REF="001812_0019_0FB83EE1C1FFCB88"/>
Pits, Drought, and of the shadow of Death, a Land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt; a most tedious, difficult and dangerous Way. The Journey to Heaven is likened to a <HI>Race</HI>; the Saint in Run∣ning it, will find himself put to it, to strive hard, and to stretch and strain every Limb and Nerve, to win the Prize. <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.1. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.24, 25. Yea, 'tis a <HI>Warfare,</HI> and continual <HI>Bat∣tel,</HI> in which there's difficulty, hard∣ship and danger enough. <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.12. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.7. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.26, 27</P>
<P>BUT when will the way of Life cease to be Difficult and Dangerous? I answer, When 'twill be easy for an huge Camel to be spun into so fine a thread, as to pass through the Eye of a Needle, (a thing as hard and pain∣ful, as dangerous!) <HI>Mat.</HI> 19.24. When there shall be no more flesh or corrup∣tion in a Saint, to make its violent &amp; virulent Oppositions and Oppressions; <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.7. When Worldly Lusts, Ob∣jects, Delights, and Inchantments have left off to war against the Soul; <HI>Mat.</HI>

13. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.11. And when the bloo∣dy Dragons of Hell, and their instru∣ments, shall never more Oppose this Way, nor obstruct and depress those that walk in it, with their utmost fraud and force, and spite and rage; then will this Way to Life Eternal, be free of difficulty and hazard. But Oh! how hard till then! Yet it leads to the best Ease and Rest, Spiritual and Eternal; yet 'tis to the New Creature, a Way of Pleasantness, and all its Paths are Peace. (<HI>Mat.</HI> 11.29. <HI>Prov.</HI> 3.17.) May we but keep there∣in, tho' with the greatest Difficulty! But the Famous Mr. <HI>Shepard,</HI> in his <HI>Sincere Convert,</HI> has sufficiently prov'd, that the Few that are Saved, are Saved with great Difficulty: And certainly they pass through great Danger too, else why should they be Commanded to <HI>Work out their Salvation with fear &amp; trembling?</HI> Phil. 2.12.</P>

Take not Thy <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> from us! and to Complain, O LORD, when we Cry out, Thou hearest not, but shuttest out our Prayers: and that when they seek Him in His House and Ordinances, they find Him not: &amp; when they wait on Him, that there are no Answers from GOD, no Influ∣ences from GOD; &amp; that the LORD has, tho' not totally and utterly, yet in a great degree Forsaken them.</P>

Ah Lord God! <HI>Who knoweth the Power of thine Anger?</HI> and all the Terrors of the LORD, &amp; of His Fatherly Wrath, which sometimes is like the Wrath or an Enemy, Who can bear them? This is GOD's Strange Act; &amp; 'tis dread∣ful work indeed: And He doth it, that so His Children may be greatly <HI>Afraid of GOD,</HI> (as <HI>David,</HI> when <HI>Ʋz∣za</HI> was smitten,) and may Tremble at Sinning, with an holy Horror and Ab∣horrence of it.

SINCE Times of Judg∣ment are so Dismal to the Godly, Let us Humbly and Earnestly Wait on GOD to be Preserved from them, in the Use of Appointed Means. The Times Come not wherein Judgment begins at the House of God to Pu∣nish the Saints, till the LORD is mo∣ved to Jealousie, by the Provokings of His Sons and of His Daughters, and until the Sins of the Times have Ge∣nerally Prevailed, and the Godly are Defiled: Moreover some Churches of Saints <HI>having kept the Word of Christ's Patience, shall be kept by Him from the Hour of Temptation, which shall Come upon all the World besides</HI>: Rev. 3.10. <HI>And taking heed to themselves, that at no time their hearts be overcharged with Sur∣feiting and Drunkenness, and Cares of this Life; and Watching and Praying always, they may be favoured and digni∣fy'd so far, as to Escape the Terrible Things of the Evil Days that shall Come,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Luk.</HI> 21.34.—36.

the Means and End are insepa∣rable, and GOD enables us duly to Use the Appointed Means, we may most certainly Conclude, that He has infallibly Decreed the End. Dread we then all Gradual Departures from the LORD, all Fallings away, and A∣postacy, all Provoking Evils: Be we the LORD's Witnesses in the World; Keep up both the Form &amp; the Pow∣er of Godliness; Do Justly, and Love Mercy, and Walk Humbly with our GOD; Daily Lay the Sacrifices of <HI>Broken Hearts</HI> upon His Altar; Live, Holding to our Glorious Head, the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and Deri∣ving Favour, Righteousness, Virtue and Strength, and Acceptance from Him; Enter we into His Chambers, &amp; Hide we our selves with Him, until the Indignation be Over-past: Cry mightily to GOD (with greatest sense of our Unworthiness of it) for His Sovereign Distinguishing Mercy; That we may be His <HI>Favourite-Noahs,</HI> and safe in the <HI>Ark,</HI> from the Overwhelm∣ing

<P>USE III. LET us be very Thank∣ful to GOD, that we have not yet felt the Scorching Heat, &amp; Terrible Dan∣gers of the Fiery Times of Judgment, as Thousands of others have done, e∣ven in our Days; some of whom have found Refuge among us. The same Years that have been Times of Judg∣ment to some, have been Times of Grace, Mercy, and Long-suffering to us. Tho' the LORD has not Left us altogether Unpunished, yet our Mi∣nisters are not Banished, nor our Chil∣dren (<HI>excepting a few in Captivity</HI>) for∣ced from us, and brought up in <HI>Soul-Destroying Popery</HI>; Nor our Holy As∣semblies

broken up, nor Dragoons let in upon us, to Torture us a thousand ways, and Compel us to Blaspheme &amp; Abjure our Holy Religion, thereby to Oppress us with Guilt, to set our Con∣sciences on the Rack, and overwhelm us with the Divine Terrors. Are we better than others, and less Sinful and Vile? Do we Escape the Woful Day, because of our Godliness and Righte∣ousness, that is greater than theirs? No verily. Why are they made our Examples and Warnings, and not we theirs? 'Tis from the LORD's <HI>Sove∣reign Grace and Good Pleasure</HI>; which therefore we should <HI>Adore</HI> and <HI>Cele∣brate with all Thankfulness</HI>; and often should think with our selves, what grateful Returns of <HI>Fruitfulness</HI> we should make &amp; render to the LORD, for all His Benefits, dispensed unto Us. <HI>Psal.</HI> 116.12.</P>

<HI>Because I will do thus unto thee, Pre∣pare to meet thy GOD, O Israel!</HI> A∣mos 4.12.

<P N="2">¶ 2. When Times of Destroying Judgment are Come upon very Wick∣ed Nations, &amp; the Best Christians then in the House of GOD among 'em, do meet with very terrible Corrective Dis∣pensations: The Impenitently wicked Reprobates in those Nations, living in Disobedience to the Gospel, will act very irrationally, if they promise themselves an Escape from Destructi∣on; they having no just pretences,
<PB N="46" REF="001812_0045_0FB83F1FF6723798"/>
whereon they may Ground their Hope thereof.</P>
<P>What else remains for them, but a fearful Expectation of Fiery Indigna∣tion to devour 'em. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.27. If such cannot Escape as neglect the Great Salvation, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.3. How can such hope to Escape as Reject it, with De∣fiance of the Glorious Saviour? That Sentence from the Mouth of the Great Judge is Unalterable, <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.3.5. Ex∣cept ye Repent, ye shall Perish. The Wicked shall be Turned into Hell, &amp; the Nations that forget GOD. <HI>Psal.</HI> 9.17. On the Wicked, GOD will Rain Fire, Brimstone, and an horrible Tem∣pest. They that finally will not be Saved from their Sins, shall be Damn∣ed. In the Day of sore Visitation, the LORD will hurl 'em from off the Earth by His Tempest, and in Hell shall they open their Eyes, being in Torments. <HI>Job</HI> 27.21. <HI>Luke</HI> 16.23. What Evangelical Preachers were the Holy Prophets, <HI>Isaiah</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah?</HI> And what fearful Perdition was the
<PB N="47" REF="001812_0046_0FB83F21B877DF20"/>
Portion of Disobedient Reprobates in their Days? <HI>Jer.</HI> 42.22. And how ma∣ny Thousands of the Gospel-Despising <HI>Jews</HI> afterwards were dispatch'd into an horrendous Eternity, in a Time of Judgment, in the Reign of the Empe∣rour <HI>Vespasian?</HI> When GOD lays Judgment to the Line, and Righteous∣ness to the Plummet, and His own People Escape not fore Punishment; all the most flourishing Pretences of the Wicked to Hope of Escape, are Vain.</P>
<P>Their Usual Pretences are,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Infinite Mercy of GOD. But GOD may be (and is) of an Infinitely Merciful Nature, and <HI>yet not be Merciful to Wicked Transgressors:</HI> Psal. 59.5. <HI>He that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them, will shew them no favour; Isai.</HI> 27.11. Almighty GOD is as Infinite in Justice, as in Mercy: and Incorrigible Sinners are fit Objects for His Justice to be Glorify'd upon, and no longer for His Mercy &amp; Patience to be abused
<PB N="48" REF="001812_0047_0FB83F2A4DA539A0"/>
by 'em: To what Purpose is it to waste any more Time upon them, who are already as Stubble fully dry, fit fewel for Unquenchable Fire? They obsti∣nately persevere in <HI>their Rejection of</HI> CHRIST, and of the Mercy of GOD in HIM, freely offered to 'em, so that they can lay no Claim to the Di∣vine Mercy, on CHRIST's account; and it's impossible they should have it otherwise: Now if those who are in CHRIST JESUS, and lay Claim to the Mercy of GOD by Faith, &amp; have a good Title to it, yet Escape not sore Temporal Punishments for their Sins, much less can Christless Sinners ex∣pect to Escape. Surely GOD will Re∣ject their Plea for Mercy, who obsti∣nately &amp; incorrigibly Reject CHRIST and Mercy. <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.24.31.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another of their usual Preten∣ces is, that they will Repent of their Sins, and Believe in CHRIST JESUS afterwards: But,</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>of their own Free-will</HI> they will ever Savingly Repent and Be∣lieve,
<PB N="49" REF="001812_0048_0FB83F2C955C1038"/>
it is utterly to be despaired of; the Malignity of their Wills appear∣ing to be Insuperable and Incurable by all Means: After so many years Wi∣thering and Hardning, it's impossible that of <HI>Themselves</HI> they should Reco∣ver to Life and Fruitfulness.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From the Lord they have no hope</HI>: For when the Time of Destroying Judgment is Come, it's too late for such as have out-stood their whole Day of Grace, to expect His Salvati∣on. GOD is weary of Waiting, and <HI>HIS SPIRIT will no longer strive with them.</HI> Gen. 6.3. <HI>Their Iniquity is full?</HI> The Set Time for Offers of Mercy is Ended: <HI>The LORD being Angry, is risen up, and has shut the Door, they being without:</HI> Luk. 13.25. Mercy has had its long Days, and now Justice and Fury must have Theirs; The Days that are now Come upon 'em, are not Days of Patience, but Days of Vengeance; they have no Pro∣mise, no Ground to flatter themselves with Expectation that GOD will give
<PB N="50" REF="001812_0049_0FB83F2E39F65D18"/>
'em the Faith and Repentance which they hate, and are continually doing all they can to harden themselves a∣gainst. They therefore will act ve∣ry Irrationally, if they Promise them∣selves an Escape from Destruction.</P>
<P>USE. Have the Wicked no Just Pretences to Hope for Escape from Destruction, and horrendous Ruine, when the Day of God's Patience is Ended? And shall it be easier for <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> in the Judgment, than for the Rejecters of the Gos∣pel, and for Rebels against the Light? And will it be e're long too late to seek for Peace with God? I say too late, when the Day of Grace is Ended! Let them then be Convinced, that 'tis most Reasonable, and account it their wisdom, duty, and interest, that they take the Present Time, to seek Reco∣very from their Wicked and Damna∣ble Estate; Not Delaying a Day lon∣ger; Not daring to put off this most Important Work, till afterwards.

Stanch the Blood; Or when Timber is falling on His Head, will not in an Instant, spring away; or when Can∣nons are Levell'd, and firing at a Par∣ticular Place where He stands, will not forthwith make an Escape from it. In a State of Wickedness and Im∣penitence the Danger is far Greater, and to Linger (as <HI>Lot</HI> in <HI>Sodom</HI>) and to delay to Get out of that Estate, &amp; Danger, is a greater Folly and Mad∣ness.

Consider then, that Mens State since the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> &amp; of Mankind in Him, is either a State of Sin, or a State of Grace: Consider also, that in a State of Sin, which is a Christless, Graceless Estate, He that Lives and Dies in it, will be cast into Hell Fire: For the Person that is not before he Dies, Saved by the LORD JESUS, from his Sins, shall be Dam∣ned

And tho' the whole Person, con∣sisting of Soul and Body United, is the Subject of Guilt and Punishment, if Christless, &amp; (if United to CHRIST) of Justification &amp; Salvation; yet Prin∣cipally is the Soul so; which is the Nobler and Guiltier Part; (without which the Body is but a dead, senseless Lump; <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.26. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.9.) yet Bodily Death is Terrible; and our LORD JESUS CHRIST came to de∣liver them who thro' fear of Death, were all their life-time subject to <HI>Bon∣dage</HI>; Heb. 2.14, 15.

Bodies, and the Importances of Time, and Acquiesce in the Love, Care and Sufficiency of the Divine Providence; for He that Deserves the Greater Trust, doth surely Deserve the Less. By Faith also the Saints Obtain the most Strengthning &amp; Comforting Pre∣sence &amp; Influences of the ETERNAL SPIRIT, to Enable 'em to Vanquish their inordinate and excessive Fears of Death. Now that the Saint who has the Faith of Dependance, may also have the Faith of Assurance, together with all Courage and Joyfulness in Suf∣ferings; he must Pray to GOD for a Stedfast Perseverance in the Way and Course of Well-doing, according to the Gospel, &amp; strongly Endeavour it. The Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> a Great Believer, and a Great Sufferer, proved this Experiment with great success: <HI>Herein exercising himself to have always a Conscience, void of Offence, toward GOD, &amp; toward man: Acts</HI> 15.16. And he found that his Up∣rightness gave him Boldness; and that Retaining himself in the Way of Well-Doing,

he Received no great Impressi∣ons of Perturbations from the Appre∣hension of Approaching Tribulations; and that he could Die upon the Cross, with Assurance and Courage; see <HI>Acts</HI> 20.24. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.8. So then to Fortify the Faith and Courage of the Believer on the SON OF GOD, (the Lord, our Righteousness and Strength,) Well-Doing is a Good Means, and what it wants of Merit, it makes up in Evi∣dence: Whereas Ill-Doing has Merit and Evidence enough to knock down the stoutest Courage. <HI>Jam.</HI> 2.17 18. 'Twas well for King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> that (when he had received the Sentence of Death,) He was able to say, <HI>LORD, I have Walked before Thee in Truth, and with a Perfect Heart</HI>; Isa. 38.3. and his Safety for Eternity prevented not his being a longer Tenant of Time; he was fit, &amp; might dare to Die, tho' 'twas not fit, that at that Time he should Die.

Promise of a Mortal Man, and to gain the Reward Promised, would be very Mindful of those things, &amp; they would break thro' all Excuses, Pretences, Dif∣ficulties and Opposing Temptations, &amp; would not fail most Exactly &amp; Punctu∣ally to Perform 'em: But tho' Almigh∣ty GOD doth ev'ry day give e'm their Lives and Senses and Reason, (worth more than many hundred Shillings,) and Promises them the future Needful Good Things of this Life, and an Infi∣nite Reward in the Other World, They dare not Trust Him, as they will trust a Neighbour; and they account all to be an Uncertainty, tho' it be the greatest Certainty of all; &amp; are not so powerfully moved to Care, Diligence, Heedfulness, and Exactness by GOD's Proffers and Promises as by Mans: for let the Infinite GOD promise never so much, &amp; give his Oath for it also, they'l suspect the matter, and doubt that they shall never have it, and you'l find 'em careless of attending the Worship of GOD in Publick, and in their Families,

Of Exhortation to a Sted∣fast Perseverance in the Way of Well-Doing, and a strong Faith in the Faith∣fulness of GOD, and to a Committing of our Souls unto His Love, &amp; into the Blessed Arms of His All-sufficient Good∣ness.

Arms. Death is not simply and abso∣lutely to be Contemned; forasmuch as 'tis a grievous Punishment for the First Sin, and GOD's Rectoral &amp; Fatherly Anger is manifested therein, when it seizes upon the Children of His Love: Yet a Pannick Dread of Death is a Great Enemy to the Holiness and Comfort of the Saints; it sometimes hurries them on, unto the Denial of their <HI>SAVIOƲR,</HI> &amp; into other Great Transgressions; &amp; at other Times, Clips the Wings of their Liberty and Chearfulness, in the Service and Communion of GOD: It's our Interest therefore to have Delive∣rance from it, by the LORD JESUS CHRIST; and His Spirit, and Grace, and Blood are sufficient in this Case: <HI>Heb.</HI> 2.15. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.9. <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.16, 20. His Spirit strengthening our Faith, it will vanquish our inordinate Fear, &amp; Purify our Lives; and our Well-doing, thro' His Grace &amp; Blood, being Well-plea∣sing to GOD, as well as Evidential &amp; Quieting to our own Consciences, will not a little Help to Advance our Hope
<PB N="72" REF="001812_0071_0FB83F674BDFCF68"/>
unto Courage and Joy, (when we are about to receive the Stroke of Death,) in our Committing of our dear, depart∣ing Souls, unto our Supream and Re∣conciled Father, and most Faithful Confederate in Heaven.</P>
<P>Let us then Clear up our Union to CHRIST, and Interest in the Promises, and Give all Diligence to make our Cal∣ling, and thereby our Election sure, and Labour to be Strong in Faith, Giving Glory to GOD, as <HI>Abraham,</HI> and to be Watchfully in the Fear of GOD, and in a Way of Well-doing, Perfecting of that Holiness, without which no man shall see the LORD: So shall we Cry, and the LORD will Answer, and the <HI>Comforter</HI> that should delight our Souls, will not be far from us, when Trou∣ble is near us; Light also shall arise to us in Darkness; and we shall have Remedy not only against Evil, but al∣so against the Fear of Evil.</P>

<P>Old <HI>Rome</HI> made Her Whole Empire to be <HI>One Great City,</HI> by Naturalizing and Endenizing all of Quality in its Remotest Provinces, and Extending its Priviledges and Franchises to Men and Towns of many Nations; and thus <HI>Paul</HI> a <HI>Jew</HI> was a <HI>Roman</HI> Born, a Free∣man of the City of <HI>Rome:</HI> Thus <HI>Papal Rome</HI> makes one great <HI>Babylonian</HI> My∣stical City, of the Nations of the World: All in all Nations who are <HI>Papists</HI> are Members of Her Church, &amp; Citizens of Her Imperial City; and no <HI>Papist,</HI> tho' of the Remotest Nati∣on is a Foreigner to the <HI>Roman</HI> Church and See; But All are admitted to be Capable of Holy Orders, and Offices; Their Council consists of Men taken out of all Her Provinces; and none of 'em by their Law shut out from Li∣berty to Qualify Himself to be Elected

to Wear the Triple Crown.</P>
<P>This <HI>Roman Catholick Church</HI> (as it Calls it self) is a Mystical <HI>Babylon</HI> for Idolatry, Sorcery, and Universal Do∣mination; and a <HI>Sodom</HI> for Wicked∣ness, and <HI>Egypt</HI> for Cruelty and Op∣pression. <HI>Rev.</HI> 11.8.</P>
<P>This Monstrous Sham-Church Esta∣blishes the Kingdom of Sin by its Si∣moniacal Vain Pardons, and Lying Miracles: and (in Times and Places of Smokey Ignorance) frights Men in∣to its Bosom, (which it Pretends to be the only Place of Salvation in the World,) by its terrible Anathemas; where, when they are come, they be∣come the fixed Marks and Butts, a∣gainst whom are directly Levelled the Chain-shot and Fire-Arrows of the Curse of Heaven.</P>
<P>It's impossible but that the Glorious SON of GOD (whose Sacred Name and Commission have been hellishly Abused, and blesphemously Pretended and Professed as a Cover and Warran∣ty for the Greatest Wickedness, and whose True Spiritual Kingdom is most of all maligned, contradicted, under∣mined, and impressed, by this Hellish

<P>Of the VIALS, and of the CUP, you Read in THIS CHAPTER, where our TEXT is Placed, as it were in a <HI>Parenthesis.</HI></P>
<P>Among Modern Authors, Mr. <HI>Junieu</HI> and Mr. <HI>Petto</HI> are of the Opinion, that the Vials are Poured out before the Witnesses Resurrection, and that the Seventh Hour Glass is at its last Sand then.</P>
<P>In the Vision, the Vials are Poured out and Emptied on the <HI>Earth,</HI> and the <HI>Sea,</HI> and on the <HI>Rivers,</HI> and <HI>Foun∣tains,</HI> and on the <HI>Sun,</HI> and on the <HI>Beast's Throne,</HI> and on <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and finally into the <HI>Air:</HI> and the Consequents thereof, are a <HI>Noisome Sore; Bloody Waters,</HI> and the <HI>Death</HI> of such as <HI>Swim in

<P>Among the Various <HI>Modern Con∣jectures,</HI> this is <HI>One, viz.</HI> That the Seventh Vial has been for some time, a Pouring out. Yet many are Dubi∣ous whether past History will afford unto diligent Enquirers, a <HI>Practical</HI> Interpretation of the Prophesie, in a <HI>Seven-fold</HI> Vengeance upon, and Mor∣tification of the Earthly Antichristian <HI>Babylyon,</HI> or <HI>Roman-Catholick</HI> Church, already inflicted, adequate to the Vi∣sion of the Vials: and it Deserves to be Inquired and Considered</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether the General and Judi∣cial Abdication of Full Communicants of that Church (that Teaches Good Works to be Meritorious of Justifi∣cation and Eternal Life) unto Dis∣mal and Affrighting Carnality and Wickedness, so as that they should

could light upon. As for the Godly on the Borders of <HI>Germany,</HI> An <HI>Army</HI> of Soldiers wearing the Cross, Went and Slew 'em all. Moreover, Two Hun∣dred of 'em were taken in One of the Castles of <HI>Tholouse,</HI> and Martyred, <HI>An∣no</HI> 1242.

of CHRIST, and Their own Salvati∣on, Unanimously, to Fall upon 'em, and utterly to Extirpate that Cursed Generation; Promising Pardon of all Sins to the most Wicked Person that should kill any One of 'em: Whereup∣on Great WARS were raised against 'em, and all Manner of Cruelty Exer∣cised, and no less than Fourteen Thou∣sand and Forty of the Godly at <HI>Cut∣tenburg</HI> were cast into one Great and Deep Pit of the Old Metal-Mines. And Seventeen Thousand into another, and Ten Hundred and Thirty and Eight into another. And they had the Victo∣ry over the Protestant Army, in the Year 1620, and took their Great City, &amp; Used Cruel &amp; Crafty Artifices to de∣stroy 'em Moreover, Pope <HI>Martin</HI> stirr'd up the Emperour and Princes a∣gain, against the Godly: The <HI>Army</HI> Entred into the <HI>Prachatice</HI> and Slew Sixteen Hundred Men, Women and Children, sparing none but such as Fled or Hid. Again, the <HI>Pope</HI> gave CHARLES the Fifth, Two hundred thousand Crowns in Money, and Ob∣liged Himself, to maintain Him an Army of Twelve Thousand Foot, and
<PB N="89" REF="001812_0088_0FB83F92B8E22240"/>
Five Hundred Horse; and Impowred Him to Sell of Abby Lands, to the Va∣lue of Five hundred thousand Crowns; and Allow'd Him, moreover One half of the Revenues of the Clergy, Enga∣ging Him to Imploy all These for the Extirpation of the Protestants; And <HI>Anno</HI> 1547, The Protestant Forces (which were raised for, and which stood upon their Defence,) were Van∣quished, and a great Persecution ensu∣ed; Many being Cruelly Beheaded, Hanged, Drowned, and Burned. Ma∣ny were destroy'd at <HI>Magdeburg</HI> about the Year 1551. The bloody <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Alva</HI> boasted that He had been dili∣gent to Root out Heresy, for besides those Protestants which He had Slain in the <HI>Wars,</HI> He had in Six Years time put into the Executioners hands above Eighteen Tousand Persons.</P>
<P>In the Year Sixteen Hundred and thirty, the Protestants of <HI>Germany</HI> suffered horrid Cruelties; Especially in <HI>Magdenburg, Hiedelburg, Griphen∣burg, Frankendale,</HI> and <HI>Hoxter,</HI> as also in <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Pomerania.</HI> being Prose∣cuted with <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Sword.</HI> In <HI>France</HI> (besides the Multitudes which the Pa∣pists

And the Hel∣lish Barbarities which the <HI>Armies</HI> of <HI>Dragoons</HI> Executed upon Hundreds of Thousands of Protestants about thir∣ty Years since, <HI>viz.

<Q>This <HI>War</HI> has Cost us very Dear; for within less than <HI>Fifteen Years,</HI> there have died above <HI>Three Hundred Thousand Crossed Soldiers</HI>; but all

<P>It may then be Queried, Whether 'twas then the Beginning of the <HI>Great Day of</HI> GOD ALMIGHTY, that Critical Day of Vengeance, intended in the <HI>Context? Pope Innocent</HI> the 3d, Offered Pardon of all their Sins, to such as wearing the Sign of the Cross would come and fight against the God∣ly <HI>Albigenses,</HI> and Destroy 'em; the Popish Bishops, Monks, and Friars (like Vile Spirits) Preached these Proffers and Pardons in the Nations; The Pope wrote also to all Christian Princes, to stir 'em up to Get this Pardon, by <HI>Joining</HI> in <HI>this,</HI> which He Called, <HI>the Holy War</HI>; and many <HI>No∣ble men,</HI> with <HI>Armies</HI> of Crossed Soul∣diers, came from year to year; the Pope <HI>promising Paradise</HI> to 'em all: Earl <HI>Montfort</HI> was made their Gene∣ral; The Grand <HI>Place</HI> of their Ren∣dezvouz, and Head Quarters, was in that Reformed Country of the Good <HI>Albigenses,</HI> which the Pope had Ana∣thematized and <HI>Cursed,</HI> and where GOD pour'd out His <HI>Curse</HI> upon the Popish Armies to their Destruction:
<PB N="92" REF="001812_0091_0FB83F99811AE9C8"/>
and whither they were hurried and Congregated for fear else of their Sus∣taining the <HI>Popes Curse</HI> themselves. Now, forasmuch is <HI>Armageddon</HI> in the Syriack Hebrew signifies <HI>Cutting off by a Curse,</HI> It may be Inquired, whether Protestant Countries may be Called <HI>Armageddon,</HI> and whether this <HI>Holy War</HI> be pointed it by the <HI>Battel</HI> at <HI>Armageddons,</HI> in our Context, as well as not Excluding the other Wars a∣gainst the Protestants, which have been for a long time Waged since? But <HI>Pareus</HI> tells us of some that write <HI>Ar∣mageddon</HI> with such Hebrew Letters as signifie the Mountain of the Gospel.

<P>As in the Day of Antichrist's Exal∣tation, ALL men should not be left to Shut themselves out utterly from ha∣ving a Part in that Glorious Promised Seed and His Righteousness, (for SOME had their Names <HI>Written</HI> in His book <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>: and such others on∣ly Worship<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> Antichrist, (utterly Revolting from CHRIST,) whose Names were <HI>not written</HI> in the Book of Life of the Lamb, Slain from the Foundation of the World; <HI>Rev.</HI> 13.8.)

Your Utmost Endeavour to Watch over your Hearts, Words and Ways, in Obedience to His Holy Commands. This Matter is <HI>not to be Despaired of; It belongs to you,</HI> and GOD <HI>will be with you; Be Strong, and Do it.</HI></P>
<P>As for Those that Complain, It's too much for 'em to be so Strict and Holy as they see some Saints to be, and that to be ever taking heed to themselves and watching of their Hearts and Ways is Unattainable; thereupon Contenting themselves to live at a loose End; They Speak and Act as Becomes not Christians, to whom the Evangelical Command is Possible, and who can (in a degree) <HI>do all Things thro'</HI> CHRIST <HI>strengthen∣ing them.</HI> Phil. 4.13.</P>
<P>You perhaps have long been <HI>Accos∣tomed not to Watch</HI>; But <HI>One Custome</HI> may be Remov'd and Taken away (tho it be a Second Nature) By the Bringing in of <HI>Another Custome</HI>; and Acts often Multiply'd, make a Cus∣tome. <HI>Suidas</HI> Relates concerning the Watchful <HI>Marcellus,</HI> that by long Use

and Custome, He had brought Himself to that Pass, as to live <HI>without Sleep,</HI> or at least, with so Little, as could hardly be Observed by any Others. Would Christians but a while <HI>Inure themselves</HI> to the Practice and Exercise of <HI>Watchfulness,</HI> they would find it <HI>Ea∣sy</HI> and <HI>Pleasant,</HI> &amp; that they could not bear to Live without it. As <HI>Colon</HI> the Famous Diver, (mentioned by <HI>Pontanus</HI>) who by the Long Practice of Swimming, could not bear to Live out of the Wa∣ter; and the <HI>Siculan-Diver,</HI> if He was long upon the Land, He was so Griped, as to be forced to go into the Water a∣gain, and that <HI>Other Person,</HI> whom the Fishermen used (in an huge Vessel of Water) to Carry about for a Show. So <HI>Julius Viator,</HI> who (as <HI>Sennartus</HI> Re∣lates) to Save His Life in a Dropsy, by little and little, used Himself to abstain from Drinking, and Held His <HI>New Cus∣tome</HI> even unto <HI>Old Age,</HI> Living to be an Old Man without Drink. <HI>Ʋse makes Perfectness</HI> in any Art, Calling or Mys∣tery; and Contributes greatly to the Dexterity, Facility and Delight of Acti∣on. Present Difficulty then should not affright us from Engaging in what is

Good and Necessary, but Next to Supernatural Helps, (which we ought to Look and Seek to Heaven for, and Depend upon,) we should betake our selves to the Power of Use and Custome, (to Use <HI>Polybius</HI>'s Phrase,) By which (<HI>saith He</HI>) all that is Good and Laudable is Possible to Man. Then <HI>Try the Experiment</HI> (as to this Duty of Spiritual <HI>Watchful∣ness</HI>) as other Saints have done be∣fore you; and <HI>This Way</HI> of Wisdom, which now seems Intoterable and most Grievous, You'l find it <HI>a Way of Pleasantness,</HI> as well as a <HI>Path of Peace</HI>; Prov. 3.17. This <HI>Yoke</HI> shall be <HI>Easy</HI> to You, and this <HI>Burden Light. Mat.</HI> 11.29.</P>
<P>'Tis then, greatly to be Lamented, that Men Who are Professors of the Gospell, should make so little Use of this so Gracious, so Sweet, and so Necessary an Help in the Godly Life, that is so much and often, and upon so many Clear Texts of Holy Scrip∣ture, preached and recommended to them, and Urged upon them. We are dreadfully and Judicially Hard∣ned,

If neither <HI>Commands, Promises,</HI> nor <HI>Threatnings</HI> can Move us, Nor <HI>Executions</HI> neither, nor the Concerns and Interests of the <HI>Divine Glory,</HI> Not yet <HI>the Sense</HI> of our own <HI>Dan∣ger</HI> and <HI>Necessity.</HI></P>
<P>It has been the <HI>Practice</HI> of the <HI>Best Saints</HI> to Watch over their Hearts, Words and Ways. <HI>Job</HI> 3.26. <HI>Psal.</HI> 39.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. &amp; 123.2. And if they have fallen into Iniquity, it has been when they have given Way to Security: <HI>And the Best have offended, when they have not been Watchful.</HI> Holy <HI>Eve</HI> in the State of Innocency, needed to Watch diligently; much more We then who are far from Innocency, and have Corrupt Lusts and Affections within Us. She (<HI>Ʋnwatchful as She was,</HI> Sa∣tans Word Stupfying of Her) took the deadly Infection, and was the first (of all Mankind,) in the Trans∣gression; and Her Holy Husband (being <HI>Ʋnwatchful</HI>) took from Her the Contagion, and transmitted it (together with an Intailment of Pol∣lution and Destruction) to Vast Mil∣lions of His Posterity. <HI>David</HI> was a

Wise Man, a Man after GOD's own Heart, and One whom We may sup∣pose to have Meditated in the Law of God as much as any One Living, and had as Awful a Fear of the Dei∣ty in his Sanctified Soul as Any, yet once and again, is Wise as He was, when it happened that He had <HI>that Piece</HI> of His Armour (<HI>viz. Strict Watchfulness</HI>) a little loose, and not well girt about Him, the Devil catch'd Him with His Bait and Hook, and Fired Him into those Gross Sins, for which He and His Royal Family, and Realm, Smarted, a long time after. Godly <HI>Peter</HI> also was led into Temp∣tation, and into Gross Abjuration of <HI>His Knowledge</HI> of the LORD JESUS, for Want of Faithfulness.</P>
<P>Tho' their seeing the Salvations of GOD, in Calamitous Times of Visi∣tation, depend upon it, Yet Christi∣ans neither do nor can Order their Conversations aright, for Want of Watchfulness, and so they Pass on and are Punished. How Hot, Hasty, Furious, Proud, Revengeful, and Foul-Mouth'd are some! Not fit to be li¦ved

with; How Worldly, Selfish, Crafty, Over-reaching, Fraudulent, Injurious are Others! So that it is Unsafe to have Dealings with 'em; What an Easy Prey to the Tempter are Many! How dull, weary, and wanting in Duty are many! How Un∣profitable! How Unreformed! How often Relapsing, and Returning to Folly! How BOLD are they when Occasions of Sinning are Presented! How Perfidious in Breaking their Vows to GOD! <HI>and all thro' Want of Watch∣fulness.</HI> How <HI>Little</HI> do the <HI>Means</HI> of Grace Profit 'em! How <HI>long</HI> e're a Lust is <HI>Subdued!</HI> How backward Do They Grow in Grace! How Barren of Good Works! <HI>and all for Want of Watchfulness!</HI> How wofully doth a Creature Comfort Inchant 'em! How doth a small Cross Distract 'em! and How doth Death's <HI>Alarm</HI> Terrify 'em! and How do the Consolations of GOD seem small to 'em, for <HI>WANT of Watchfulness!</HI> A Fatal <HI>Want</HI> indeed, and enough to Undo a Man, and Spoil His Trade for Heaven! On the o∣ther Hand, the Blessing is on the Head of Watchful Christians.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="001812_0140_0FB83E82A1183E88"/>Watchful Christians, are Humble, and broken-Hearted for Sin, and Pray∣erful, and Holy, and Heavenly-Min∣ded, and Joyful, and Exemplary, and very Fruitful Christians. Watchful∣ness is a Means to Prevent their Falls, to Suppress their Lusts, to Promote their Peace, and Put the Adversary to Flight, to make their Tongues a Tree of Life, and to Render their Actions defensible a∣gainst their Accusers. Watchfulness is a Nurse to the New Creature, Paves the Way to the Best Evi∣dences, and Richest Experiences, and furthers their Holy Boldness at the Throne of Grace, and their At∣tainment of the <HI>Refreshing Shines</HI> of the Light of GOD's Counte∣nance. All <HI>Other Gifts</HI> are <HI>Beauti∣fyed</HI> by this of Watchfulness; and GOD is <HI>Honour'd; Christianity</HI> is most advantageously <HI>Recommended</HI> to the Observing World; <HI>Religion</HI> is Made a <HI>Delight</HI>; the <HI>Saints</HI> are put into a Glorious <HI>Transfiguration; Believers</HI> live at an <HI>High Rate</HI>; and the <HI>Blessed</HI> GOD <HI>delights in their Persons and Services</HI>; And what

High Degrees of Glory shall Crown the Heads of the most Watchful Christians, <HI>We shall Know</HI> to our Joy (<HI>if We be Such</HI>) <HI>When We Come to Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Good LORD Bless these Words to Us, and Quicken us to Watch, and to Keep our Garments, that We may be Blessed at His COMING. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
