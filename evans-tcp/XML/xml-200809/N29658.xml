<P>UPon the often and earnest Desire and Solicitation of some Sober Persons, that heard these Sermons Preached, I have adventured to make this <HI>Plain Discourse</HI> (about Timely Preparation for Heaven) Publick. And if thou art Reconciled to, and really in Love with Truth &amp; Holiness; here is that put into thine Hand, (which if GOD add his Blessing) will stir up thy pure Mind to greater seriousness and diligence in the matters of thy Soul. Now, that it may conduce to thy spiritual &amp; eter∣nal Advantage, is his Desire who Prayeth for thy Souls welfare,</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>MATT. XXV. 1.</BIBL>
<P>And they that were Ready went in with Him to the Marriage, and the Door was shut.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Things of greatest moment are by most men little believed, less consider∣ed, till it be too late; That besides this present World, (which must have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> period) there is another World of in∣ternal duration: And that according to our choise▪ life, and doing here will our doom and eternal ha∣bitation be in the World to come; so that there is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n indispensible Necessity to make ready for a bles∣sed Life of Immortality. This grand Concern, the Parable of the ten Virgins warns and alarums as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to. In which Parable are two parts▪</P>
<P>First, the Churches Preparation to meet Christ, called here <HI>The Bridegroom,</HI> from the first to the fifth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>the Bridegrooms coming forth to meet the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> from the fifth to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fth verse. The Text fall
<PB N="2" REF="039482_0004_10142569E8EDC880"/>
under the second part. <HI>viz. The Bridegroomes coming to fetch home his Bride:</HI> O welcome day! The words serve as a Glass or bright Sun-beam, to represent the different estate of believers and unbelievers, wise and foolish Virgins, at Christs coming by Death or Judgement.</P>
<P>In which observe three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The preparation of the wise Virgins, <HI>They were ready.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Their Welcome and Admission to the Marriage, <HI>They went in with him,</HI> i e. <HI>into the Presence-Chamber of the King of Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. We have the doleful Rejection and Exclusion of the foolish Virgins, <HI>And the Door was shut.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctrine that I shall Collect and Handle from the words is this, <HI>They and only such who are graciously qualified and prepared for Christ in this World, shall enjoy eternal Fellowship and Communion with Christ in the other World.</HI></P>
<P>The greatest part of our happiness that we shall have in Heaven lies in this, <HI>That we shall be with Christ.</HI> Dost thou desire a better Countrey? <HI>viz. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> safe to Heaven</HI>: Keep thine eye ever upon thine end, and know that here life is gotten or lost to Eternity. Sinner, do not deceive thy self, to hope for Heaven, and do the work of Hell; if thou dost expect to go in with Christ, and enjoy God and glory hereafter, daily use the means, and go in the way to Heaven here. There is a congruity between the way and the end: They answer one another, as face an∣swereth face in the water; or as the War and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Seal, the Voice and the Eco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> answer each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. If thy heart and Life cry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaven, Heaven, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>▪ End or Death will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Heaven; but if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Practice cry hell, hell, thine End like the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Voice will cry hell, hell. As men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="3" REF="039482_0005_1014256E6D845800"/>
they drink, and receive wages according to their work; and as you sow you reap: the Harvest is the end of the World; they that were ready went in, not one more. Heaven consisteth partly in the fit∣ness and preparation of the Soul and body for that blessed Society above. The Paradise of God would be a Prison, may I not say a hell, to the impious and unholy.</P>
<P>Sore eyes cannot behold the Sun without grief, Swine will not stay in the most pleasant Medows <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hence, no work so irksome as Christs, no time so uncomfortable and tedious to wicked men, as abi∣ding under Christs wings in his Ordinances.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to speak to the several branches in the Doctrine, I must enter a Caveat or Caution.</P>
<P>First, this Meetness, Fitness, and Preparation for Heaven, is not to be understood in a way of Popish Purgation or Merits, <HI>viz.</HI> by <HI>Prayers, Acts of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ifi∣cence, Almes, Pilgrimages, Penance, Purgatory, &amp;c.</HI> The Reward is of Grace, not of Debt, or Desert, for <HI>all our Righteousnesses are but as filthy rags; and when we have done all we art but unprofitable Servants</HI> (saith our Sa∣viour,) <HI>Isa.</HI> 64.6. <HI>Luke</HI> 17.10. Our good hope and everlasting consolation is through grace.</P>
<P>Secondly, the readiness is not to be understood▪ as if all that shall go to Heaven with Christ have an inherent, sinless, and personal Perfection; As Stars have their twinklings, and Diamonds their flaws, and the best Gold doth need some grain of al∣lowance, so the most eminent Christians have their frailties and mixtures of corruption. <HI>Solomon</HI> chal∣lengeth the whole world, when he saith▪ <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> say I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made my heart clean, I am pure from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 'Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there is a generation pure in their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yet, you are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from their filthiness,</HI> Prov. 30, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Pharisees, and some Perfectionists of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; whereas the Life of the most holy Man in the World, is not as a Garden without we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> this is
<PB N="4" REF="039482_0006_10142571BA6E7F00"/>
reserved for Heaven. And if none die comfortably, or go in with Christ but those who have lived per∣fectly, then every man must go out of the World with despair and terrour; for the failings of Gods People are more than their duties, their Corruptions more than their Graces: so that whoever goes to Heaven, must be beholding to the redeem∣ing blood, and justifying righteousness of the Lord Jesus. This being premised, I shall proceed to the Explanation of the Doctrine, in which I shall observe this Order and Method.</P>
<P>First shew, <HI>That there is a Fitness and Preparedness in Believers for their future state of blessedness.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That this Fitness is in the day and time of Life, not after Death.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>What this Fitness for Christ &amp; Heaven is.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, <HI>I shall give the Reasons upon which all must prepare, and why none else must goe with Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, <HI>Improve all in several Uses.</HI></P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I.</HEAD>
<P>FIrst, <HI>That Believers are divinely qualified for their state of Blessedness; being a People made ready and prepared for the Lord,</HI> Luke 1.17. That those wise Virgins are fit and accounted worthy to go in with Christ, will appear three ways.</P>
<P>First, by their int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>fecal Endowments and Qua∣lifications, or what God hath done in them</P>
<P>Secondly, by the choice Epithites and Titles given to them.</P>
<P>Thirdly, their Priviledges and Regalities with which they are invested and ennobled.</P>
<P>First, their inward Frame and Constitution dot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> exceed the whole World. There is most rare, curi¦ous and inimitable work of the Divine Spirit upon the souls of all that shall go in with Christ. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vers are his Workmanship; They are renewed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Spirit of their mind, and have put on the new man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="5" REF="039482_0007_10142574AE89D568"/>
after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. They are holy Brethren, Partakers of the heavenly Calling, and a divine Nature, and transformed and changed from glory to glory into the same Image.</HI> They are said <HI>to be called to Glory and Vertue,</HI> and the life they live is cal∣led <HI>the Life of God,</HI> and their conversation is said <HI>to be in Heaven,</HI> Eph 2.10. Eph 4.23, 24. Heb. 3.1. 2 Pet. 1.4. 2 Cor. 3.17.</P>
<P>Secondly, their Titles do speak their Fitness; They are called, <HI>the Children of the Bride-chamber, Children of the Kingdom, Children of the Resurrestion, Christs fair One, the Kings Daughter, Gods Jewels, his peculiar Treasure, his excellent Ones, such of whom the World is not worthy.</HI></P>
<P>What is the chaff to the Wheat, or pebbles to Pearls, or clods of Earth to the bright Stars, or the children of hell to these earthly Angels. The Name of a Christian is a most honourable Name. <HI>Alexander</HI> thought himself happy that he might be named <HI>Achilles,</HI> and <HI>Caesar</HI> if he might be called <HI>Alexander.</HI> The Believers Name is of greater Renown. <HI>Solon</HI> was called <HI>the Wonder of</HI> Greece, <HI>and the Glory of the</HI> Greeks, but he was not to compare with the meanest Saint. <HI>Constantine</HI> and <HI>Valentinian,</HI> two famous Em∣perours, called themselves <HI>Vassallos Christi,</HI> the Vassals of Christ; and <HI>Theodosius</HI> another Emperour professed, <HI>It was more honour to him, to be</HI> Membrum Ecclesiae quam Caput Imperii, <HI>a Member of the Church, than Head of the Empire.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, their Priviledges also do evidence this Fitness, which are all Royal▪</P>
<P>First, they have a Royal Descent, and so the Sons and Daughters of the Lord God Almighty, <HI>My First-born,</HI> saith the Lord of <HI>Israel</HI> of his people. We read of the children of base men, viler than the Earth, <HI>Job</HI> 30.8. <HI>Jezabel</HI> is called a cursed woman, though a Kings Daughter. <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> is called an abomi∣nable branch, and <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes,</HI> a vile person.
<PB N="6" REF="039482_0008_101425765C49FD38"/>
Believers are of God, and born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of men, but from above, <HI>John</HI> 3.</P>
<P>Secondly, Moreover they have a Royal Spirit. <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> told <HI>Daniel. In him was the Spirit of the holy Gods. Joshua</HI> and <HI>Caleb</HI> (that entred into the holy Land) were men of another spirit, <HI>Numb</HI> 14 24. This Spirit that fits them for Heaven is a holy Spi∣rit, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.4 <HI>A Spirit of Grace, a Spirit of Glory.</HI> 1 Pet 4 14 So called, because it comes from the God of Glory, and prepares them for Glory.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they have Royal Offices, and are em∣ployed about Royal business They are Kings and Priests, whose Employment is Prayer &amp; divine praise, <HI>Rev</HI> 1.6. <HI>Psal.</HI> 6 24. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.5, 9</P>
<P>Fourthly, they have Royal attendance, the glo∣rious Angels; these Watchers who are great in strength, stand as Sentinels at their doors to protect their Persons, day and night while they live: And they must Convey their Souls thorough the Devils Territories safe to the Place of their everlasting habi∣tation, after they are dead, <HI>Psal.</HI> 34 8 <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.14. <HI>Luke</HI> 16.22. If you are by Grace prepared for Glo∣ry. God is your God, and this is your Guard.</P>
<P>Fifthly: they have a Royal Law, which is the Rule and Standard of their Obedience to God. <HI>Jam.</HI> 2. 8. The Writing was the Writing of God, who was both the Doctator and the Scribe, <HI>Exod.</HI> 32.16. where note, that the Scripture is the word of God, <HI>John</HI> 10 35.</P>
<P>Sixthly, they have Royal Apparel a Royal pre∣sence, and belong to a Royal City: and when they go in with Christ, they shall be on the Throne Roy∣al, and have the Crown-Royal.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied, but that they are set apart for God, and fitted for his Presence, <HI>Psal</HI> 4 3 <HI>God hath se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the man that is godly for himself.</HI> Mire segre∣gavit cum indicio excellentiae, (<HI>saith one upon the
<PB N="7" REF="039482_0009_10142579A573B908"/>
Place</HI>) God hath gloriously, wonderfully, miracu∣lously separated to himself the godly man. Here Note.</P>
<P>That we do not make our selves fit, or meet for Heaven, God must do it. <HI>Who can make his heart clean?</HI> we may wash the out-side of the Cup, God must cleanse that which is within, <HI>viz.</HI> the heart, from wickedness. <HI>I am the Lord that healeth thee.</HI></P>
<P>Christians are made fit by Redemption, by Voca∣tion, by Adoption, by Justification, by Sanctifica∣tion.</P>
<P>This shall cause the godly to wonder at the Pow∣er of Divine Grace. If a King cast his favour on a mean subject or slave, and prefer him to a great and honourable Office, yet he cannot change his na∣ture, and give him fitness for that place: But God doth not only give a Kingdom to his Saints, but in∣wardly adapt, and fit them for that Kingdom. And as none had right to the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> but the <HI>Israe∣lites,</HI> so none have right to Heaven but the Saints; (but of this more afterwards.)</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II.</HEAD>
<P>SEcondly, <HI>This Readiness is in the day and time of Life, not after death. Oh that thou hadst known in this thy day</HI> (said Christ to the Jews) <HI>the things that belong to thy peace.</HI> There is a time known and ap∣pointed of God, after which they shall never repent and be converted, who have enjoyed and lived un∣der the means of grace, and are not converted. 'Tis true, the eternal God is not limited to any term or means, but man is limited to time and means. Sin∣ner, thou hast a great work to do, a long journey to go, and many and mighty adversaries to divert and hinder thee; thy Work is to prepare for Death and Judgment, which is very near; thy Voyage or Jour∣ney is to the everlasting World, Provision must be
<PB N="8" REF="039482_0010_1014257BEEC30608"/>
made while in the way. To apply this a little, and to quicken you to husband the precious Talent of Time in order to Eternity. I shall propose three things; First, consider how short and uncertain our being in the World is. Secondly, as life is short, so the continuance of the means of grace will not be long Thirdly, when gray hairs, old age, sick∣ness, (<HI>Solomons</HI> evil day) comes, that is not so fit and proper a season to prepare for Heaven: First, re∣member how short and uncertain thy being in the World is; <HI>Our life is but a vapour,</HI> Jam. 4 14. that soon appeareth and disappeareth, dispersed as soon as raised. 'Tis a little spot of time between two Eter∣nities. One of the Ancients doubteth, whether to call it a dying life, or a living death: And if our life (which is a breathing death) had been less then a vapour, it had been nothing at all. The Psalmist describes Man as <HI>Grass,</HI> Psal. 90 <HI>In the Morning it flourisheth, in the Evening it is cut down, and withereth.</HI></P>
<P>Man continueth but a very short time, his life is but a span long, or but a day long, like <HI>Jonah</HI>'s Gourd, came up in a night, and perished in a night. The first step man sets upon the stage of this World, he is going out of the World. The Naturalists speak of a Fly they call <HI>Ephemeron,</HI> a creature of one day, which cometh forth in the Morning, is very active about Noon, but when the Sun declineth, it declineth too, and sets with the setting of the Sun.</P>
<P>Man is an <HI>Ephemeron,</HI> a creature of one day. The Ancient of days sets up our Glass in Heaven, there at is running, and we see not how it hastens to an end. Think, O devout soul, of the sugarity and swiftness of thy time here below, the Line and Lease of Life will quickly be out: It is but a point of time that we live, while we do but turn, Immor∣tality is present. This present Life is but the
<PB N="9" REF="039482_0011_1014257EB71643B0"/>
place of our Inn and Sepulchre; The Beginning of this Life is but the <HI>Exordium</HI> of Death, <HI>Vita hujus Principtum statim Mortis est Exordium</HI> We are carried every moment of time to the <HI>End of Time.</HI> Our Life is but but like one sailing; he who doth sail, whe∣ther he stand or sit, whether he sleep, watch or walk, he is carried nearer the Port; may we not say with old <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen 47.4 <HI>Few and evil have the days of the years of my life been</HI>: where we have his Ac∣count cast up; God is the great Landlord of our time, the Lease is for life, not years but days, not many days but few. <HI>Life</HI> (said one) <HI>is a Rose which if we view in its growth the Cold nips it, the Heat wi∣thers it, the Wind shakes it, be it never so fair it withers:</HI> Another saith, <HI>Life is a counterfeit, what if the Colours be fair, and the Resemblance near, the Shadows of Death, and the Curtains of the Grave will darken all</HI>; 'Tis a Play, We enter at our Birth, and Act all our Life, presently there is an <HI>Exit,</HI> or end, and away we go. One being asked what was Life, he shews himself a little, and hides himself again, his mean∣ing was this. Our Life is but a little shew, no sooner are we seen, but immediately we are hid and gone. O sleepy and secure sinner, think of the certainty of Death, the danger of thy Soul, the nearness and length of Eternity, and the Neces∣sity of preparing in a moment of time for an ever∣lasting estate. Die and leave the World we must, in the Grave there is no work, after Death the Judgement, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9 27. Sin poisons the Arrow in the Quiver of the King of Terrours, and puts the Sythe into Deaths hand that cuts us down▪ Methinks Sins speaks to the several Generations of men whom Death hath conquered, as <HI>David</HI> to the Priest who had escaped <HI>Sauls</HI> bloody sword, <HI>I have been the occasion of all this.</HI> Sin and Death are coupled to∣gether, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8 2.</P>
<P>Secondly, as Life is short, so the continuance
<PB N="10" REF="039482_0012_101425824CA56570"/>
of the means of Grace will not be long. There are many faithful, able, painful Ministers have Preached their last; and an abundance, yea, mul∣titudes of Sinners, time-losers, that have heard their last; and this will be my case and yours in a little time. The Prophets, do they live for ever?</P>
<P>We have but a little time to intreat and to treat with you about your Souls, to call, invite and per∣swade you to come to Christ, and accept of mercy: and which Minister or Sermon shall be the last thou shalt hear, who can tell? <HI>There are six days,</HI> said the Master of the Synagogue, <HI>Luke</HI> 13. <HI>in which men ought to work, in them therefore come and be healed. We must seek the Lord while he may be found,</HI> Isa. 55 6 <HI>For behold now is the appointed time, now is the day of salvation.</HI> 2 Cor. 6.1. Moreover, as the Ministry and outward means is uncertain, so the time of the Spirits working with the Word is uncertain, <HI>My Spirit shall not always strive with man:</HI> The Spirit is compared to the Wind, who can tell when the Wind will blow, and how long it will continue its sweet gales to convey us to glory. The Door of grace is yet open to lost and undone sinners, who have slighted mercy. God did not deal so with the Angels that fell, they sinned, and the Lord cast them down, and shut the Gate of Glory upon them immediately. But the day for the things of thy peace is continued. Its said, the Devil is busie because his time is short, <HI>Rev.</HI> 12.12. And shall we be worse than the Devil: The time is short, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.27. <HI>The Angel will ere long swear by him that liveth that time shall be no more.</HI> You that are travel∣ling towards Heaven must make haste, the Work∣man that sets a time for his task, listens to the Clock, and counts the hours. We have a great task and a short time, redeem it in order to Eternity. This is Gods hour, and this is mine; what I do for my dear soul, what I lay up for Eternity must be now
<PB N="11" REF="039482_0013_10142583D55F3CB8"/>
done or never. O remember, its but an hour, but a day, and this will quickly pass away: In what anguish of soul, despair and torment, will many wish for those hours again: the loss of so many op∣portunities for the gaining of Heaven, will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s so many drops of gall and poison in thy honey▪ <HI>it makes me weep,</HI> said one▪ <HI>when my Hour-Glass is beside me, to see every speck of sand to follow other so speedily</HI>; therefore the Apostle exhorts <HI>to Redeem time; I must work,</HI> said our dear Lord, <HI>while it is day,</HI> Joh. 9.4. Sinner, if Death should come, and find thee unready, thou art undone soul and body for ever.</P>
<P>The time of gray Hairs, old Age, Sickness, is not the fittest season to prepare for Heaven. When thou comest to a Bed of Languishing, and thy strength wasted, thy breath short, dost thou think to Cough-up. <HI>Lord have mercy upon my soul,</HI> and that will be sufficient to prepare thee for Christ, and bring thee to Heaven. Besides, it is almost a won∣der to hear of any one converted to God at the last gasp, when men are ready to enter into the Gulf of Eternity. In the Word we have only in∣stance of the Thief upon the Cross; but remember his Conversion was one of the Wonders of Christs Passion; when Christ was on the Cross, the Sun was darkned from the sixth hour to the ninth hour, the Vail of the Temple was rent in twain, the Earth did quake, the Rocks rent, the Graves opened, the Bodies of Saints which slept arose, and a notori∣ous sinner was converted, all which is wonderful. <HI>Austin</HI> being sent to give his judgment of one that had delayed, and put off his repentance, returned this Answer, <HI>Non dico damnabitur, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dico salvabi∣tur,</HI> I do not say he shall be damned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not say he shall be saved, but repent while it is well; Life or Death, Salvation or Damnation, may depend upon this day. <HI>Tamerlain,</HI> when he had laid siege

<P>THirdly, <HI>Let us now enquire what this Prepara∣ration to go in with Christ is.</HI> And I wish that all who read this Discourse may understand it, not only notionally, and speculatively, but also heartily and experimentally.</P>
<P>In answer to this third Particular, here is some∣thing Negatively, and something Positively, and both in reference to believers and unbelievers.</P>
<P>Negatively, Preparation for Christ and Heaven, doth not lie or consist in any thing that is natural, or acquired by mans utmost industry. Let the Qualifications, Endowments, Improvements and Attainments of men be never so rare &amp; excellent, while without supernatural regenerating Grace, they cannot be fit and prepared for immediate &amp; eternal fellowship with God. To explicate this, take these four Particulars.</P>
<P>First, Readiness for Christ and Heaven doth not consist in being Virgins, <HI>i. e.</HI> Church Members,
<PB N="13" REF="039482_0015_10142587B5B7B580"/>
and in having the specious leaves of Profession. There are more than a few who pretend to and profess the true Religion, that are carnal, rotten &amp; false in that Religion: All in the visible Church, that are sealed with the Sign and Sacrament of Initiation, are not fit for Divine Communion. <HI>Ni∣codemus</HI> was Circumcised, yet not fit for the King∣dom of Heaven <HI>Judas</HI> was an Apostle &amp; Preacher, but the Son of Perdition: <HI>Simon Magus</HI> was Bap∣tized, and in the gall of Bitterness.</P>
<P>Many think, 'tis sufficient to save them, that they were born in <HI>England,</HI> and descended of Re∣ligious or Protestant Parents, that they keep their Church, say their Prayers, receive the Lords Sup∣per, and procure their absolution when dying; The unbelieving <HI>Jews</HI> gloried in their External Rites and Priviledges, crying out, <HI>The Temple of the Lord!</HI> And because they had their Priests and Sacrifices and could go up to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to worship, they were (as they thought) the happiest people in the whole world. How many Atheists and Haters of God and Holiness, have been Baptized? Rest not here; for he is not a <HI>Jew</HI> that is one out∣wardly, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.28. <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.13. God calls the Cir∣cumcised <HI>Israelites, Kine of</HI> Bashan, <HI>and the Children of the</HI> Ethiopian, <HI>An.</HI> 4.1, 7, 9.</P>
<P>Secondly, Neither doth it consist in trimming of <HI>Lamp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, i. e.</HI> in External Duties and Religious Acts, which to the view of the world may be splendid and very plausible. <HI>Bona opera non fa∣ciunt bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irum, sed vir bonus facit opera bona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Luther.</HI> Good works do not make a good man, but a good man makes good works Unregenarate men their services proceed from the same princi∣ple that their sins do. The Tree must be good
<PB N="14" REF="039482_0016_1014258A8F3AE530"/>
before the fruit can be good▪ the outside of the cup or platter may be clean; men may hear the word gladly, so did <HI>Herod,</HI> and pray frequently, so did the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and those Hypocrites <HI>Isa.</HI> 58. Men may receive the Lords Supper, so did <HI>Judas,</HI> and do much more, and yet be far from the King∣dom of Heaven: Moreover, they may be exact in their Second Table Duties, wrong no man, be just and righteous, give unto <HI>Caesar</HI> the things that are <HI>Caesars,</HI> (so were some of the Heathen) and yet be strangers to God, the New Birth, Union &amp; Communion with Christ, without which no man can be capacitated, and prepared for the Divine Presence.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Neither doth this readiness for Christ lie in being of such a party, and opinion, or in being hot and zealous for such modes and forms of Religion and Worship. A man may be Epis∣copal, a Presbyterian, an Independent, an Anabap∣tist, and a stranger to the Life and Power of Reli∣gion. The <HI>Jews,</HI> High Priests, and Elders: The Scribes and Pharisees were zealous for <HI>Moses</HI> Law, the Custom and Traditions of their Fathers; but the worst Enemies Christ had. The Prelate of <HI>Rome</HI> sticks not to Impose on and Depose Princes, and their bloody deluded Vassals can murder and shed the blood of <HI>Protestants</HI> out of cruel religious Zeal.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Neither doth it lie in mental Illumi∣nations and excellent rare Parts, Gifts, Common Grace, and good Opinion, and Approbation of the best, most serious and judicious men. A mans Mind and Intellectuals may be Adorned with rare Notions; he may be able to dispute most readily, accurately and profoundly about Theological

Principles; he may Pray and Preach like an An∣gel, and be in high esteem in the Church; and yet have nothing in him to Intitle him to Christ, and prepare him for heaven. There is shining Dross and counterfeit Silver, which deceiveth many, as a <HI>Bristol-stone</HI> may shew and shine like a Diamond, and a Counter like a piece of Gold; the Picture of a man may be like a man, and Ar∣tificial Flowers are as fair, and look like Natural Flowers; so Common Grace hath the resemblance of Saving Grace; so that some question whether it differs in Specie or Degrees only. There are partial and almost Christians, who seem to bid fair for Christ and Heaven, as <HI>Judas, Demas,</HI> and ma∣ny others. And who can tell how high &amp; emi∣nent men may be in Office and Profession, how Sound and Orthodox in Judgment and Opinion, how deep in Conviction and Contrition, how re∣gular in Conversation, how zealous and warm in Affection, how forward in Duties of Piety and Charity, and ready to Suffer, how lifted up with aiery tittillations of Joy, sips and tasts of comfort resulting from thoughts of Free Grace, and mis∣applying the Promises, and the superficial transient Operations of the Spirit, and but have it with God, and fall short of Heaven: How much alike were these Virgins (to say nothing of their Agree∣ment in number and name) they were all in So∣ciety, they were all Asleep, they were all awake∣ned &amp; rowsed up, they all went to work &amp; trim'd their Lamps, they all went out to meet the Bride-groom: &amp; the Foolish came to the door with, <HI>Lord, Lord, open to us</HI>: If good words, and wishes, and, <HI>O let me die the Death of the Righteous,</HI> will save men, they would all go to Heaven. Many spin

small, and make Hypocrisy seem a good Web, &amp; go through the Market as Saints among men; and yet steal quietly to Hell without Observation: <HI>So easie it is to deceive men,</HI> (said an Eminent Divine) <HI>'Tis doleful to think, and see such Troops and Droves of prophane, ignorant, presumptuons men and women, go down merrily to Hell, with a Golden dream and hope of Heaven</HI>; Like the Fish that sport and play in <HI>Jor∣dan,</HI> and then fall into the Dead Sea; like <HI>Haman</HI> that went chearfully to <HI>Hesters</HI> Banquet, not know∣ing his life was the mark that she aim'd at: How many secure Souls asleep in sin go out of the World; and never Awake till they come to Hell?</P>
<P>Having spoken something in the Negative con∣cerning this fitness and readiness for Christ. I proceed now to the Positive part of my Answer, wherein it doth consist.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is an initial, or an habitual readiness for Heaven, and there is also a more actual fitness to go in with Christ.</P>
<P>As soon as a man is taken out of his Natural Soil, and the Seed of God is sown in his heart, he is habitually ready for his future Happiness. If a Believer should Die the first Day of his Con∣version, he would certainly go to Heaven, witness the Thief upon the Cross. But truly there are many dear Children of God not actually prepared, because their Spiritual Estate is not so well settled. 'Tis a great Duty for all that are espoused to Christ, to be in a constant and continual readiness to meet Christ, and have immediate Communion with him: but sad experience proves it is not so. A Woman may be Espoused to another, and yet she may be sometimes not ready to meet him
<PB N="17" REF="039482_0019_101425938AF57F08"/>
her Ornaments may be off, and her soul Apparel on. To Resolve this I shall shew.</P>
<P>First, When the Christian is not Ready.</P>
<P>Secondly, When he is actually Ready.</P>
<P>First, When the Believers Soul, like <HI>Hezekiah</HI>'s Sun, is gone some degrees backward, <HI>i. e.</HI> under re∣markable declinings; And the best things in him are ready to die, <HI>viz.</HI> Grace, Inward Joy, Peace, Old Experiences, Godly Sorrow are ready to die. If the first warm, burning, flaming Love of the Espousals be lessened, and much abated towards Christ, so that the mans heart doth vigorously go forth after sensual Objects, and the Dead Child is put in the place of the Living Child; is he fit to go in with Christ? If Grace be under remarkable decays and witherings, and the Souls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>auty de∣parted, can a man then welcome Christ? What cause have thousands to Cry out with the Prophet, <HI>My Leanness! My Leanness!</HI> Is it not Autumn or Winter in many a Soul? How little life and love have you, and much ado to maintain it. I heard a good Woman, in a despairing condition, complain of want of Natural Affection to her Hus∣band and Children. And may we not with ho∣ly <HI>Bradford,</HI> weep for want of love to our dearest Lord and embracing the bosom of a Stranger. If the Wives affection be withdrawn from her Hus∣bands Person is she fit now to appear before him, when she hath no heart to receive him? There∣fore strengthen the things that are ready to die, blow up the spark of love into a flame, and thou mayst say, <HI>Come, Lord Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, When the poor Christian, being un∣der Desertion, is doubtful of his Eternal Condi∣tion, and cannot tell what will be his place when he leaves the world, he is unfit. When thick
<PB N="18" REF="039482_0020_101806AE5DCECC60"/>
Mists surround us, and black Clouds cover us, the many sinking fears, jealousies and damping doubts about the love of Christ renders us Un∣ready. This is the case of many a Soul who hath made choice of God to be his, and wonders at his love to him, yet is ready to speak as the Church, <HI>Zion said, The Lord hath forsaken me, my God hath forgotten me,</HI> Isa. 49.14. <HI>My Soul is cast down,</HI> saith <HI>David, within me, all his billows pass over me; hath God forgotten to be Gracious?</HI> I doubt my heart is not upright, that my foundation is not sound, that I shall be shut out of Heaven, saith the des∣ponding Soul. <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> tho' he walked before God with a perfect heart, yet bitterly complain∣ed that he was cut off. A very Holy and Learned Minister complains thus, <HI>I have often disputed, whether or no I knew any thing of Christianity, ex∣cept the Letter of the Name.</HI></P>
<P>The Woman in Mr, <HI>Bolton</HI> said, <HI>I have been the Mother of Nine Children, and have born them with as much Pain as most Women, yet I could be contented to bear the same Pain every Day, that I have endured with all my Children, to be assured of my Part in Christ.</HI> Another Cried out, <HI>He could be contented that his Body should burn in Hell a Thousand Years, so that he might be assured of the least Favour from God after∣wards. And will you not pity me,</HI> saith Mrs. <HI>Drake, that must burn in Hell for ever?</HI> Sirs, in a time of Desertion, when God hides his Face, and Heaven is out of sight, the Child of Light walks in Dark∣ness, the Soul is not ready. The thoughts of God are terrible. <HI>I remembred God, and was troubled,</HI> saith <HI>David, I sink, the deep waters are come into my Soul. The Arrows of the Almighty are within me, the Poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the Terrors of God do
<PB N="19" REF="039482_0021_101416B85C2AD0C0"/>
set themselves in array against me,</HI> Job 6.4 <HI>O pity me my Friends,</HI> Job 19. Another walking in the Field (seeing a Fly) Cried out, <HI>This Fly comes Armed with the Wrath of God against me.</HI> Now when the trembling Soul apprehends it self to hang like an equal ballance between two Eterni∣ties, and cannot tell whether he shall go up or down, live or die, be saved or damned; he is not fit to shoot the Gulf: This made <HI>David</HI> Pray, Psal. 39 ult. <HI>Spare me a little before I go hence and be no more.</HI></P>
<P>Here Note, That there is a double Desperation, <HI>A Desperation of Infidelity,</HI> and, <HI>A Desperation of Ex∣tremity</HI>; The former, <HI>viz.</HI> A total and perpetual Desperation, none of Gods Elect ones shall fall under: but the latter, the Desperation of Extremi∣ty, (which doth cure their stupidity, and provoke and prompt them to the use of the means) they are obnoxious to: They are sometimes brought very low in their Souls. <HI>Luther,</HI> by reason of the trouble of his mind, wish'd he had never been a man. The Christian sits solitary as a Widow for∣saken, his sighs are many, and his heart is faint, when God covers Himself with a Cloud. This made a Godly Woman dying (whose Evidences for Heaven could not be read) Pray, <HI>Lord, Let me not go to the Place where the Wicked are, for I never loved them in my Life.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, After some sad Fall, and when a man is under some violent Temptation, on Passion, he is Unready. A Good Man may be under the power of some sudden, hot and sinful Passion, and assaulted with an hellish Temptation, he may be tempted to Curse and Blaspheme God, to Destroy himself; he may be bereaved of his Reason and
<PB N="20" REF="039482_0022_1014259A031CE7D0"/>
Understanding, and be ragingly Mad: Passi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is the Law of the Soul, and <HI>brevis insania,</HI> a short Madness. <HI>Job</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah</HI> in their Passion, did both Curse the Day of their Birth; <HI>Jonas</HI> told God, <HI>He did well to be angry.</HI> Moreover, after a Christi∣an hath fallen into some gross foul sin God may frown and write bitter things against him, fill his Conscience with terror, hang him over Hell, and threaten to remove him out of his sight: till he hath renewed his Repentance. A foul Fall doth so grieve the Spirit, that it may make God carry himself towards his as if he were an Enemy. God doth deal with his for their great Transgressions, as <HI>David</HI> with <HI>Absolom,</HI> who commanded him out of his sight, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 14.24 In this sad and deplo∣rable Case, Evidences for Heaven are blurred, and all old Experiences of the Love and Favour of God are under Ground. <HI>David</HI> after his fall was as a Dead man, and Prayed, <HI>Cast me not away from thy presence,</HI> Psal. 51.11.</P>
<P>Fourthly, When a man hath Omitted known and commanded Duties, let down his Watch, and neglected his Lords Work: and falls a nodding, or into a Lethargy, (as these Virgins did) till roused up with the Cry of Midnight, he is not prepared to go in with Christ. If a Mans Conscience draweth up a black Bill of Indictment against him, for the neglect of the most weighty and important Duties, he is no more fit to meet Christ, than <HI>Adam</HI> after he had eaten the Forbid∣den Fruit, or a Steward who had much betrusted him to improve for his Lords use, and let all sea∣sons go wherein he might have Traded &amp; G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in'd somewhat for him. How can he appear before him when no fair account may be seen; so the
<PB N="21" REF="039482_0023_1014259B900D1D98"/>
Lord hath intrusted thee with many Talents, Grace, Parts, Time, Strength, Health, Means, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And you are not Lords but Stewards of all these▪ How can you with comfort and confidence stand before Christ, if that be neglected? O thus it is with many a Christian, who hath lost that vigour, zeal, activity and forwardness for the Work of God that once he had. Hence come those sad A∣larms, stings &amp; convictions of Conscience, shakings and sinkings of spirit under the sense of guilt.</P>
<P>And is not this the case of many Virgins? so that if Christ should arrest, and summon them by death, and call them to <HI>reddere rationem,</HI> give an Account, how many must Answer, <HI>Not ready Lord, my work is not done.</HI> O then betimes do your work, and set things right in your souls every day.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>When is a Christian actually ready?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> A Christian is actually ready when he hath those rare and gracious qualifications of the wise Virgins, (<HI>viz.</HI>) his Vessel clean, and the Oyl in his Lamp and Vessel, <HI>i. e.</HI> The Spirit of Christ &amp; the graces of the Spirit: which are called Rows of Jewels, Chains of Gold, and Rivers of Living Water. This is the Anointing, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 2.27. That Oyl upon <HI>Aarons</HI> Head which ran down to the Skirts of his Garment: Christ the Head of Influ∣ences (of whom <HI>Aaron</HI> was a Type) was Anoint∣ed above his Fellows, and of his fulness Saints re∣ceive grace for grace, <HI>John</HI> 1.</P>
<P>But more particularly,</P>
<P>First, When a Christian (being past from na∣ture to grace) can prove by the Word that infal∣lible truth, that he is in a state of Salvation, and hath therefore good hope, through grace, that his soul is safe.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="039482_0024_1014259E5A9972C0"/>When <HI>Noah</HI> was shut up in the <HI>Ark</HI> he was out of danger, and prepared for the deluge, and could not be drowned, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>When a Believer is gotten into Christ, he hath shot the Gulf, and cannot be damned, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1. If thine affection be espoused to the Lord Jesus, and divorced from all others, so that thou hast ac∣cepted him for thine Husband, and given him thine heart, thou canst not fall short of heaven, or miss of going in with Christ. Sinner, do not count upon a Kingdom of Glory and eternal Sal∣vation, without a sound Conversion. Read what Christ: spake to his own Disciples, Mat. 18 3. <HI>Verily I say unto you, except you be Converted you shall not en¦ter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</HI> What more plain than the Doctrine Christ Preach'd to <HI>Nicodemus Except a man be born again he cannot see the Kingdom of God, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</HI> Joh. 3.3. Why then shouldst thou hope, and expect to enter into Life, who dost hide &amp; har¦bour Gods Enemies, and art yet in thy sin Christian, hath thy renewed heaven-born-soul th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Impress of the Divine Image on it? <HI>Caesars</HI> Coi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had <HI>Caesars</HI> Image? Is holiness to the Lord engra¦ven upon thy heart? Hast thou that divine dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that can swim against the Stream of corrupt n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ture? God is resolved that not one grain of savin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Grace shall go to Hell: Certainly, thou art a ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sen Vessel and ready, when ever Christ shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to go in with him to the Marriage. The rich of Glory are the inheritance of the Saints, and thou hast a mind to see the very Picture of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> invisible God, look upon a pious, humble, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> man: There is a resplendent beauty on the Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ver, no Son so much like a Father, no Daughter
<PB N="23" REF="039482_0025_101425A39D6E6898"/>
like her Mother as the Saint is like God. What is brave Silken habit upon the body, Earings, Jew∣els, upon the Neck, Plaited-Hair, Curls, Towers, Spots, and Paints on the face and forehead, to a Sanctified holy heart? The Church is glorious within, there is that in the Christian (<HI>viz.</HI> the new Creature) that can call God Father; Holiness is the Arms of heaven, the Harbinger of heaven; we may see the harvest of glory in the seed of grace. Grace is glory in its nonage, and glory is grace grown up to its perfect stature: The time cannot be long between a Christians Conversion and his Coronation.</P>
<P>Secondly, When a believer is gotten into the suburbs of Glory by Communion with God, and his heart is sincerely set to please and honor him; when it is thus, he may say with <HI>Jacob, this is no other but the house of God, and this is the Gate of Hea∣ven.</HI> 'Tis real Acquaintance and Communion with Christ, and conformity to Christ, must make us ready. Canst thou take the greatest compla∣cency in pleasing God, and say of it as the Mar∣tyr, of his prison, <HI>This is better than any Pleasure, than any Paradise,</HI> I pronounce thee ready for the divine Presence. When a man hath a single eye to make Gods Glory his mark, and is sometimes taken into the mount of divine Communion he is certainly prepared for the vision &amp; eternal frui∣tion of God above. But on the contrary, if thou art a stranger to God, and unacquainted with Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit, he will say to thee at the last day, as to the thready fool∣ish Virgins, <HI>I know you not,</HI> Mat. 25.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. What I shall say more to this question shall be in the Ap∣plication.</P>

<P>THE fourth Branch of the Doctrine assigns, and shews <HI>the Reasons why those that are ready shall go in with Christ.</HI> Upon which the necessity of our pre∣paring will plainly appear.</P>
<P>The Reasons respect God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the blessed Spirit, and Believers themselves.</P>
<P>The Reasons that respect God, are, 1. From the eternal purpose of God. 2. From the pure Love of God. 3. The sure Promise of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. From Christ. 1. His Relation to them. 2. His Obligation to them. 3 His Prayer for them. 4 The Dignity and honour of Christ.</P>
<P N="3">3. From the Spirit. 1. The Sanctification of the Spirit. 2. The habitation of the Spirit.</P>
<P N="4">4. From Believers, and the right that they have to heaven. 1. They have a purchased right. 2. An hereditary right. 3. A right of fitness</P>
<P N="1">1. This divine qualification of Saints for heaven is from the purpose of God, which is as unalterable as God himself. Immediate Communion with God in heaven is that happy and sublime End Believers are appointed unto, Faith, Repentance, and an innocent pious life of conformity to God, is the direct way and means to come to, and obtain that end. The way to the Temple of Honour, is through the Tem∣ple of Vertue.</P>
<P>He that ascends the holy hill of God must have clean hands. Man by nature is in a corrupt and cursed State of Damnation: and not only disioyned from God, but Alienated from God, and there can be no fellowship without friendship. Man hates God in his heart, and two cannot walk together until the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be Agreed, <HI>Amos</HI> 3.

needs keep us out. The best part of corrupt man is against God, his mind is enmity in the abstract, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8 7. which notes an exceeding excessive enmi∣ty; and can there be any familiarity where there is this enmity? Moreover, they that do not prepare for Heaven do not mind Heaven, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.5. All their thoughts, projects, designs, delights, do savour of the flesh; Light and Darkness, Fire and Water, Love and Enmity are not more contrary than our dispositions to God: Hence results our misery, to be at odds with our Maker; and can there be any thing more mon∣strous, than for a creature to oppugn and hate his Creator? And if <HI>Absalom</HI> rise against his father <HI>Da∣vid,</HI> no wonder he commands him home to his house. But who complains of this rooted enmity to God, which we have cause to bewail in tears of blood. The unholy say to God, <HI>Come not near us, stand by thy self.</HI> And 'tis no wonder if God say to them, <HI>Depart from me, ye Workers of Iniquity.</HI> But God hath ordain∣ed all who shall go in with Christ to Heaven to be holy, Eph. 1.4. <HI>God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through the sanctification of the Spirit,</HI> 2 Thes. 2.13. 1 Pet 1.2.</P>
<P>Our effectual Calling, Conformity to the Image of his Son, Justification and Glorification is from Gods Purpose and Predestination, <HI>Rom</HI> 8.28, 29, 30. Holiness is, the beaten Road and High-way to our Fathers House: so that it will not consist with the purpose, honour and holiness of God to admit unholy Men to Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. The prepared soul is infinitely and eternally belov'd of God, who hath put his Name in the Book of Life.

'Tis nothing to the favour of God, to have a place in his heart: Gods Love was <HI>Davids</HI> life, <HI>In thy favour is life, and thy loving kindness is bet∣ter than life,</HI> Psal. 63.3. <HI>Titus Vespasian</HI> was stiled <HI>Deliciae humani generis,</HI> the delight of Mankind: but the Believer is the Delight of God, his <HI>Jedidiah; Abraham</HI> was Gods Friend &amp; Favourite, St. <HI>Paul</HI> wrote to all in <HI>Rome,</HI> beloved of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.7. Christian, trace &amp; follow the Chrystal stream of Divine Grace (which laid the foundation of thine eternal happiness) and thou shalt find it in the heart of God. But we are like men that look on the River <HI>Nilus,</HI> and gaze won∣drously on the streams, remain still ignorant of the Head and Original from whence they issue, <HI>Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee; Thou hast loved them as thou hast lov∣ed me,</HI> Isa. 43.4. John 17.23. And if it be a Curse to be unready, as those foolish Virgins, who were therefore shut out, it must needs be infinite mercy to be ready. The Apostle makes it the First-fruits of glory, to be ready: To be prepared unto glory is the glory of mercy. <HI>I know not which</HI> (saith a Divine) <HI>is the greatest love, to prepare for glory, or to bring into the actual possession of it.</HI> For Divine Grace so to Metamorphize and transform a Man, as to turn a Lion into a Lamb, <HI>Saul</HI> a bloody Persecutor into a zealous Preacher, a Devil into a Saint, to make of poisonous dross a vessel of Gold, and then to fill it with glory, is love with a witness, <HI>Luke</HI> 8.2. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.10.11. <HI>Augustine</HI> made one his servant that would have killed him.

There is a mutual knowledg and acquaintance, <HI>I know my Sheep, and I am known of mine,</HI> Joh. 10.14. <HI>These have known me,</HI> saith Christ, <HI>John</HI> 17.25. 2.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Reas.</HI> Christs most excellent Mediatory Pray∣er before his death, doth assure every Christian indeed that he should be with him.

<P N="4">4. <HI>Reas.</HI> The honour and dignity of Christ calls for this readiness, who is the Prince of all the Kings of the Earth: the Unregenerated are with∣out God, and none of Christ. <HI>His Servants you are whom ye obey,</HI> Rom. 6.16 Wicked men are the Devils Spouse, the men of the Earth are the Worlds Spouse. Justitiaries and the self Righte∣ous are the Laws Spouse, and it would be a great dishonour for such to go in with Christ. Will any man invite or suffer Toads, Serpents, Vipers or Devils, to come and abide with him and Lodge in his bosom? Is it fit a man that is Le∣prous, and hath Plague-Sores running on him, should come and stand in the Presence of a Prince? The <HI>Lepet</HI> under the Law, though a King, was to dwell alone, the strange Woman in <HI>Moses</HI> time was to have her Hair cut, and Nails pared before the was to come into the Congregation of Gods people, or be Admitted into the Church.

Preparation is ne∣cessary when we come into the outward Court of Ordinances, much more when we are to enter into the Holy of Holies, <HI>viz.

<P>Soul, prepare to meet thy God in Glory, if thou hast any respect to his Honour, and thine Eter∣nal Welfare.

Sup∣pose these Virgins had turn'd Harlots, and gone a Whoring from him till his very coming, and then had been taken in, what might the World think, doth he love the company of Harlots? Christian, if thy heart go a Whoring from God, after the World and Lusts, it is a disgrace to the Lord Je∣sus: Whereas 'tis for the honour of this Great King at the time of Solemnizing the Marriage, for his Wife to make ready, Rev: 19.7 <HI>Be ye also ready,</HI> saith Christ.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="039482_0034_101425BE114B3348"/>THE third Ground respects the Spirit.</P>
<P>First, the Sanctification of the Spirit.</P>
<P>Secondly, The Habitation of the Spirit.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Sanctification of the Spirit, which hath in∣fused his whole Divine Nature through the holy soul of the Believer; and though a godly man is not Sanctified perfectly, yet he is Regenerated and Sanctified in every part, <HI>viz.</HI> Spirit, Soul and Body, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.17 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.23. 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.13. Saints are sanctified by the Holy Ghost, <HI>Rom</HI> 15.6 And must to Heaven, <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.5. <HI>Acts</HI> 26.18.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Habitation of the Spirit: God hath his upper house and his lower house, the highest Heavens and the lowest hearts: Hear a comfortable word from the Mouth of God, <HI>I will dwell among the Children of</HI> Israel, 1 <HI>King</HI> 6. 13. Believers are a Ha∣bitation of God through the Spirit, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. <HI>ult.</HI> The Heart of an unbeliever is the Devils house, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.44. And he that hath the Purity of a Dove will not take up the Lodging of a Devil. And if the heart of a wicked man be a little Hell, the heart of a holy man is a little Heaven. The Believer hath Glory in him, Heaven in him, <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven is within you,</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>ye are the Temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwelleth in you,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.16. <HI>Origens</HI> father ('tis said) many times uncovered the breast of his son as he lay asleep, and kissed it, as the Tem∣ple wherein the Holy Ghost had taken up his Resi∣dence: Christians, stand and wonder at this mercy, and say as <HI>Elizabeth, Whence is it that the Mother of my Lord should come to me,</HI> or rather my Lord himself? <HI>Not many wise men after the flesh, not many Mighty, not many Noble are called,</HI> 1 Cor. 1.26. Under the Law the Lion and the Eagle were passed by, and the Lamb and the Dove were chosen. That God should come over the heads of Kings and Queens to visit thee▪ O wonderful Condescention that God should dwell

with us (said a serious Person) who have not a hole to put our heads in! Thus it is, God hath taken up his residence in many a little house: The pre∣pared soul may say of the presence of the Living and true God, as one said of his <HI>Idols</HI> (who dwelt in a little Cottage) <HI>The gods are here with me.</HI> But will God in very deed dwell with men on Earth (saith <HI>Solo∣mon</HI>) 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 6.18. Yea, God by his Word and Spi∣rit doth dwell with men on Earth, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.16 Where God hath recorded his Name, he hath promised to meet his people, and bless them, <HI>Exod.</HI> 20.24. The Saints who are pure in heart see his out-goings in the Sanctuary. <HI>The King is held in his Galleries,</HI> Cant. 7.5. And they who meet God and Christ in his low∣er Galleries of Ordinances, shall ere long meet him in the upper Gallery of glory. <HI>For this we groan ear∣nestly, desiring to be cloathed upon with our House, which is from Heaven,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.2.</P>
<P>THe fourth Ground respects Gods people, to∣gether with the Place into which they are to go with Christ. Those that are prepared by Grace, have an absolute and unquestionable right to the Kingdom of glory, into which no unclean thing shall ever enter. Believers who are holy in heart and life have a threefold right to Heaven.</P>
<P>First, they have a purchased right, and that by the blood of God. The heavenly Inheritance of Gods prepared people is bought with a price, so that what the great Surety, and Captain of our Salvation hath purchased, Gods people shall actually possess: this is most certain, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.28. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.20. <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.14.</P>
<P>Secondly, they have an hereditary right to Hea∣ven, being of the blood-royal, and born to the King∣dom, <HI>They are not of the world, as I am not of the world; He that it born in mine house,</HI> said <HI>Abraham, is mine heir</HI>: every Believer is as <HI>Isaac,</HI> a son indeed, an heir of sal∣vation,
<PB N="34" REF="039482_0036_101425C33A2D2870"/>
<HI>Rom.</HI> 1.14. And they have all the right of Inheritance. Christians, you are all the Children of God, and heirs, and Joynt-heirs with Christ, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 17. This should affect your hearts with infinite de∣light. The Kingdom wherein <HI>Augustus</HI> the Empe∣rour most delighted was that which he had by In∣heritance.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They have an aptitudinary right, <HI>viz.</HI> a right by way of fitness, and this is in the Text, <HI>Those that were ready went in with him to the Marriage.</HI> The Presence of God and Angels doth not become the unclean: Let mens Pretences and Profession be never so fair, without grace there is no glory: The <HI>Rhodians</HI> and the <HI>Lydians</HI> had a Law, <HI>That those sons which followed not their Fathers in vertue, but lived vi∣tiously, should be disinherited. Without are Dogs,</HI> saith St. <HI>John, Rev.</HI> 22.15. The <HI>Irish</HI> Air will not brook a Toad or Serpent to breathe in it, much less will Hea∣ven suffer wicked men to live there. Those that will not, cannot please God, are unfit to appear in his Presence. Plants and Trees may associate and converse with beasts, and beasts with men, assoon as man with God in Heaven, till they be holy: but be∣lievers do please and honour God, and make it their business to do his Will, <HI>They have kept thy Word, I am glorified in them,</HI> saith Christ, <HI>John</HI> 17. <HI>And them that honour me will I honour,</HI> 1 Sam. 2.30. The well-doers must receive the commendation of <HI>Well done, They that have done good shall come forth to the Resurrection of life,</HI> John 5.29. <HI>Blessed are they that do his Com∣mandments, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in thorow the Gate into the City,</HI> Rev. 22.14.</P>
<P>To conclude, all Gods prepared people have now the right of propriety to Heaven, and when they die they shall have right of possession, <HI>This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise,</HI> Luke 23.43. This is that the Saints on Earth breathe and pant after, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.23. <HI>I desire to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, which is best of me.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. Then Divine Grace in the Saints is wonderfully efficacious. The best of us (like <HI>Joshua</HI> before the Angel) are clothed with polluted garments, and too much unready. Now to adorn and beautifie souls stained and fullied within (in whom there is the filthiness of the flesh and spirit, <HI>viz.</HI> an universal de∣filement) is the highest evidence of the Power and Vertue of the glorious Grace of God When a Mans heart is moulded and fashioned for God the Divine Spirit (like the Sword of the Lord and <HI>Gideon</HI>) doth great things, <HI>He that hath wrought us for the self-same thing is God,</HI> (saith <HI>Paul</HI>) 2 Cor. 5.5 <HI>Thine Hands have made me and fashioned me,</HI> (saith <HI>David</HI>) <HI>I will praise thee, for I am fearfully &amp; wonderfully made, marvellous are thy Works, I am curiously wrought.</HI> If <HI>David</HI> wondred at the Wisdom, Power and Goodness of God in his well-formed comely body, consisting of such various parts and members, how should we stand and wonder at the transforming and renewing mans soul after the Image of God. The Law was written on the two Tables with the Finger of God, and this upon the hid∣den man of the heart, is also the Lords Work, and mar∣vellous in our eyes. The Work in the Tabernacle and Temple was rare and curious, but yet not to compare with this of the Holy Ghost; It shall be said of <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Israel,</HI> what hath God wrought. <HI>We are his workmanship, Eph.</HI> 2.10. In the great House of God the Church, all are not Vessels of Gold, and prepared for glory. But we may know what Vessels are for special use, by their metal and curious en∣graving on them. Sinner, if thine eyes were open, thou mightest see Heaven, God and Glory engraves upon every such vessel of mercy. Moreover, this
<PB N="36" REF="039482_0038_101425C909E76680"/>
supernatural grace in the heart is not a dead habit, but a living spring, which prompts men to duty, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15 10.</P>
<P>SEcondly, Faithful Ministers (who are Workers together with God, and watch for mens souls) must vehemently urge the necessity of Faith, Repen∣tance and Holiness, without which none are ready, or can possibly be saved; There is a spiritual Le∣thargy seiz'd upon the Christian World: <HI>they all slumbred and slept.</HI> How stirring in our Ministry must we be to awaken men out of this stupor and security, and to fit them for Heaven. The Scrip∣ture hath its sting, and its honey; there is Mount <HI>E∣bal</HI> and Mount <HI>Gerizim,</HI> the Rod as well as the <HI>Man∣nah</HI>; the Arrow of Repentance must be levelled at the heart, and we should deliver the whole Councel of God. <HI>The Word that I shall speak, that thou shalt speak,</HI> said the Angel to <HI>Balaam, Numb.</HI> 22.35. Christs Embassadors have their Authority and Commission from God &amp; his Word, &amp; therefore they must be plain, particular and piercing in their Preaching, otherwise the blood of never-dying souls will lie at their door: The Word of God like a well-drawn Picture, looks right upon every one: and what we find in Sacred Writ we must preach, please or displease. Is not this written in the New Testament, <HI>that he that believes shall be saved, and he that believes not shall be damned,</HI> Mark 16.16. <HI>He that believeth not shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</HI> John 3. last. Men must be turned from darkness to light, from the Power of Satan to God (which is the chief end of Preaching) before they can receive the Inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in Christ, <HI>Acts</HI> 26.18. You must turn or die, repent or perish, be in tears or flames, be holy or never see Gods Face in Glory, <HI>Luke</HI> 13.5 <HI>Heb</HI> 12.14. Happy are they that live

under a Ministry who have will and skill to prepare souls for Heaven. Particular Preaching is penetra∣ting and profitable, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.7. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.36, 37. <HI>Gene∣ral Preaching</HI> (said a worthy Divine) <HI>is deceitful and deluding Preaching. He that Preacheth to every one preacheth to no one,</HI> (saith a learned Doctor.) <HI>'Tis like a loaf of bread set before a Company of little Children,</HI> said Mr. <HI>Hildersham. Universaliae non operantur</HI> King <HI>James</HI> said of a Reverend Prelate of this Land, <HI>Me∣thinks this man Preacheth of death, as if death were at my back.

<P>Sinners asleep upon the Mouth of Hell must be awakened, as it were with the voice of thunder. If a Traveller passing through a Town in the dead of the night, saw a house burning; Would he whisper out <HI>Fire, Fire</HI>? no but cry <HI>Fire, Fire, Fire,</HI> with a loud voice. 'Tis the Cry at Midnight that must awake the slumbring Virgins, and nothing else; <HI>Jonah</HI> must cry in the streets of <HI>Nineveh,</HI> and <HI>Jeremy</HI> must cry in the streets of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> But what must we say or cry to the secure World? Mercy, Pardon, Peace, Salvation, Heaven? No, Fire, Fire, Hell, Hell, Damnation, eternal Wrath and Vengeance, without speedy and Hearty repentance to God: this is the Plough and Harrow of the Law, that must go deep and break the fallow ground, and turn up the Turf upon the Sinners impenient obdurate heart. <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> and Jesus began their Ministry with the doctrine of repentance, <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.8.4.17. Sound∣ness, sincerity, zeal, perspicuity and impartiality in the distribution of the Word, is ordinarily blest of God, to make ready a people prepared for him.

with <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> to perswade and woo for Christ, and when we have gained Mens consent, and espoused them to Christ, our work is half done. Ministers are Gods Builders, Men must be fitted for the Building: The Stones in the Temple were not rude and unpolish'd Stones, but hewed, squar'd and made ready, so also were the Utensils of the Tabernacle, the Gold, Silver, Brass, and carved Tim∣ber.

<P>Sinner, is thy state hopeful, who cannot, will not live a life of holiness; It may be thou hast the face, profession, and form of Godliness, so had the foolish Virgins, so had the Pastor and Members of the Church in <HI>Sardis, Rev.</HI> 3, 1. There are also many that have not so much as the bark or form of Religion, and hate the life and power of it. Canst thou mock, and scoff at a vertuous pious life, and think thy self un∣done to part with thy lusts, and give thy heart to God, and yet hope well? If Christ doth not reign in thine heart, and make it holy, thou canst have no hope here, nor Heaven hereafter; <HI>Command</HI> (saith God) <HI>that every Leper be put out of the Camp,</HI> Numb. 5.2.

<P>THirdly, If none shall go in with Christ but those which are ready, but a few then com∣paratively of this great World shall be Saved, and enter into Glory. God hath said it, whose Word must stand.

few of the six hundred thousand that came out of <HI>Egypt</HI> entred into the Promised Land? Look into the broad way to death, and hell, and see what Troops and Droves of men and women are there, and how few there be in the narrow way: No wonder you hear the Apostle say, <HI>Tho'</HI> Israel <HI>be as the Sand of the Sea, but a Remnant shall be saved.</HI> And who can read, and hear this, and not be astonished? Are there not Multitudes, Thousands, and Ten Thousands that have the Image of Hell on them, and ready to drop into Eternal Flames, and will you not believe it? Separate the Wheat from, the Tares, the Swine from the Sheep, the Precious from the Vile, <HI>viz.</HI> all Prophane persons, all Hy∣pocrites, and it will appear. What thoughts of heart, fear &amp; trembling, should this cause in every place and among all people? When Christ told his Friends, the Elect, Tender-hearted Disciples, there was but one bad among them, they were all afraid. What cares, fears, jealousies should we have about our Souls? All that concerns the soul is weighty, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. The evil of the soul is an Eternal evil, and the good of the soul is an Eternal good: Where then is your caution, and solicitude about this soul affair? If the Soul miscarry and is lost, all goes with it, <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.26 <HI>What will it profit a man, to gain the whole World, and to lose his own Soul?</HI> Christian, dost thou not see many set out in the Race, that fall short, and lose the Crown? and shall we not serve the Lord with fear? 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9 24. <HI>Psal.</HI> 2 11. <HI>Heb.</HI> 4 1.

Converted. <HI>The Children of the Kingdom shall he cast out,</HI> (said Christ) Oh, how sad is this! <HI>Mat.</HI> 8 12 Be not deceived, the heart is a great deep, very deceitful, a most accurate Impostor. Grace is a Mystery, the Old Serpent is subtil and very busie, and Pirate-like, sets forth his false Colours, and transforms himself into an Angel of Light. There∣fore take thine heart with thee in Private, and search and try thy state, and compare thy Heart and Life by the Word, that thou mayst find whether thou art ready, <HI>Isa.</HI> 28.20. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5. <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.4</P>
<P>FOurthly, If those that are ready shall go in with Christ, then Gods dear Saints should not fear Death, but rather desire it. Those that are fit to die, need not fear to die. Death is yours, (saith St. <HI>Paul</HI> to Believers) which tho' it dissolve the Union between the Soul and Body, it cannot part God and his People. 'Tis more facil and easie to dry up the vast Ocean, or to separate Light and Heat from the Sun, than to separate Christ from his Church, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.35. God saith, <HI>They are his, my Portion my Jewels, not one of which shall be lost.</HI> All Gods holy Ones shall come safe to their Fathers House. Their Names are written in Heaven, their Head &amp; Husband is in Heaven, <HI>John</HI> 14 2. And as St. <HI>Paul</HI> affirmeth, <HI>That Saints sit there,</HI> Eph. 2.6. <HI>The Righteous,</HI> said St. <HI>Peter, are scarcely Saved,</HI> 1 Pet. 4.18. But truly saved. Where∣as they that are but almost saved, are never saved. A thing done with difficulty is done; it was with difficulty and danger the <HI>Israelites</HI> got into the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> with danger <HI>Paul</HI> and his com∣pany
<PB N="41" REF="039482_0043_101425D615E18448"/>
got safe to shore, and tho' they were in great Peril, not one perished. A Babe in Christ is built upon a Rock, and a Child in the Ark had been as safe as a Giant. Heaven and Happiness is not in our hands, but in the hands of One mighty to save. None can pluck them out of my Fathers hands, underneath are everlasting Arms. Who can be too hard for Omnipotency, or fetch a Be∣liever out of Gods Hand? The Covenant of Grace is an Everlasting Covenant, and shall stand fast. Death and the Grave could not dissolve the Hypostatical Union of Christ, He took his humane Body never to be separated from it; so also his Mystical Body. 'Tis true, Death and Dooms∣day must be very terrible to Vessels of Wrath, fitted to Destruction, God, Christ, Scripture, and Conscience are against them, and all their Hea∣ven is here, <HI>Luke</HI> 16. <HI>Psal.</HI> 17.14 The Malefactor must needs fear the coming &amp; face of the Judge: <HI>When</HI> Paul <HI>reason'd of Judgment,</HI> Felix <HI>trembled,</HI> and cause enough, <HI>Acts</HI> 24.26 But <HI>lift up your Heads and Rejoice,</HI> saith Christ: <HI>Haste, my Beloved, Haste.</HI> Amen. <HI>So come Lord Jesus.</HI> When the Bride is attired, and her beautiful Ornaments about her, she expecteth the coming of the Bridegroom; and when he comes his Reward is with him: The Martyr could say, <HI>'Tis well for the present</HI> (who had the First fruits of Glory) <HI>and it would be better.</HI> Your sorrow (said Christ) to his disconsolate Disciples, shall be turned into joy, <HI>I will not leave you, I will see you again.</HI> Say then, Welcome Death, who must carry me home: The beloved Wife doth not fear, when abroad, to come to her Husband, nor the dutiful Child to his indulgent Father: Christ called his Death, <HI>A going to his

Father</HI>: Who died to bring many Sons to Glory. A Godly Gentlewoman had made Death so fami∣liar to her (by conversing with it, and preparing for it) that she did look upon it as her Fathers Servant sent to fetch her home, from School, Death doth the Saints more good than all Ordi∣nances or Afflictions, it brings into fellowship with Christ quickly, immediately, eternally; the certainty of all Believers coming to Heaven, was Typified in the <HI>Israelites</HI> passing over the Red-Sea, not one was Drowned, neither was one <HI>Egyptian</HI> Saved. To note, that all wicked men will be Damned. The men of the world have a short Heaven, and all in hand; but the Christians best is yet behind. In this strange Land, Gods Peo∣ple are not known, being as Princes out of their own Countrey; <HI>But when Christ who is our life shall appear, we shall be like him, and see him as he is,</HI> 1 John 3.2.</P>
<P>FIfthly, It greatly concerns all while they have time and means, to make ready for Eternity, Two things argues an excellent spirit and great wisdom.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To see Evils afar off.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To see Time and Opportunity when it is near.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>First, To see Evils afar off, especially Soul-evils, an Eternal loss; <HI>A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself.</HI> Secure sinner, look forward, and see what is before thee, or over thine head, <HI>viz.</HI> a cloud big∣ger than a mans hand, yea, a storm in the clouds▪ which <HI>Noah</HI> saw a hundred and twenty Years before it came. The threatning Word, like Lightning, hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>asht in thine eyes, expect a Clack and Thunder-bolt of Divine Wrath shortly to follow. The Lord will
<PB N="43" REF="039482_0045_101425DA98366128"/>
come with Fire, to render his anger with fury, and his rebukes with flames of Fire. <HI>The day cometh that shall burn as an Oven, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble,</HI> Isa. 66 15. Mal. 4.1. <HI>The Coming of the Lord draweth near.</HI> James 5.8. <HI>Behold the Judge standeth before the door</HI>; the year of vengeance and day of recom∣pence is at hand; <HI>He hath appointed a day in which he will judge the World in Righteousness,</HI> Act. 17.31. <HI>He that shall come, will come, and will not tarry,</HI> Heb. 10.37. <HI>The day of the Lord so cometh as a Thief in the night, and when they shall say Peace and Safety, sudden destruction cometh upon them, and they shall not escape,</HI> 1 Thes 5. 13.</P>
<P>Secondly, To see time, and opportunity when it is near, for every thing is beautiful in its Season: God hath joyned Time and Duty together, so must we. Hear what advice wise <HI>Solomon</HI> giveth us for our future welfare, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 9.10. <HI>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might, for there is no Work, nor Device, nor Wisdom, nor Knowledge, in the Grave, whither thou goest.</HI> When thy breath is gone nothing can be done; what we leave undone here will be undone for ever: There is no coming back into the World to act another part, to live a Second life, to mend our work: For as the Tree falleth so it lieth; after death there is no means, no Ministry, no mercy, no duty: It will then be Impossible to re∣pent, the date of Gods long suffering will be out, and the day of grace over, and no patience, no pity, no pardon on Gods part: There is no heaven to be found in hell, nor one drop of water to cool the tongue. Then fear, and seek the Lord, and secure your Souls while he may be found, <HI>Isa.</HI> 55.6. Go now to the Fountain of Divine Grace, and fill and furnish your hearts with oil, or it will be too late to buy in a little time. 'Tis sad &amp; doleful to think how poor Sinners will cry out for oil and grace, pity and pardon when it is too late, <HI>Give us of your Oil, for our Lamps are gone out,</HI> (saith the foolish Virgins.)
<PB N="44" REF="039482_0046_101425E063A90358"/>
Is it nothing, Sinner, to slight an offered Saviour, will it not be bitterness in the latter end? <HI>This is the Condemnation, for how shall we escape if we neglest so great Salvation?</HI> Heb. 2.3 Now, or never; the Holy God saith, <HI>To Day,</HI> and Christ saith, <HI>He is at the Door,</HI> Rev. 3.20 Will you open to him, or keep the door of your Hearts shut? What, shut out, and put off a Christ, a Christ, who is worth infinite Worlds? God; forbid. Say in the words of the Psalmist, <HI>Be ye lifted up ye everlasting Doors, and the King of Glory shall come in,</HI> Psal. 24, 7, 9 Sinner, remember this, if thou dost Bar and Bolt thy Door against Christ now, there will be two other Doors shut in a little time.</P>
<P>First, the Door of Heaven, the Gate of Mercy and Glory, to keep all out that are out</P>
<P>Secondly, The Gate of Hell will be shut to keep all in that are in. When <HI>Noah</HI> that righteous man was shut up in the Ark, there was no Entrance for any more, all without were left to the deluge, and lost. It's dreadful to the Malefactor, when the Gaoler turns the Key upon him, and leaves him in his Bolts and close Prison. If it went so near <HI>Moses</HI> his heart to be shut out of <HI>Canaan,</HI> how wilt thou bear the shutting out of Heaven? There was a doleful Out-cry, when the Earth closed her Mouth, and <HI>Korah</HI> and his company went down. O what a hideous shreck and cry will men make when the Mouth of Hell shall be shut upon Sinners for ever, for ever.</P>
<P>SIxthly, Believers should highly esteem and heartily Love one another, being to go in to∣gether. Christians, Love is of God, and Christs new Commandment; And let me tell you, Saints have the greatest Obligation to Love.</P>
<P>First, You are everlastingly and equally belove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of one God and Father, and are given to one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

Redeemer, to whom your hearts are joyned as your Head and Husband. You are renewed and sanctified by one most holy Spirit, whose mark is set upon you all; You are going to <HI>Jerusalem</HI> that is above, towards which your faces are, being Fellow-Citizens with the Saints and Houshold of God. And when your War∣fare and Peregrination is ended, you shall begin with Christ, and meet in an everlasting Habitation. Bre∣thren, and Beloved, will you not love them whom not only the great and good God, but great and good men have loved. <HI>The Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour</HI>; and such were <HI>Davids</HI> excellent ones, and his companions, <HI>Psal.</HI> 16.3. and 119.63. 'Tis a Character of a Citizen of <HI>Zion</HI> to contemn a vile person, but he honoureth them that fear the Lord, <HI>Psal</HI> 15.4. <HI>And by this we know,</HI> said the beloved Dis∣ciple, <HI>that we are passed from Death to life.</HI> 'Tis storied of an ancient King who made a Feast, and invited a company of poor Christians, and he bade his Nobles also. Now when the Nobles came, he set them in his Hall; when the Christians came, he had them up into his Presence-Chamber: One ask'd him the Rea∣son; He answered, <HI>I do not this as I am their King here, for I respect you more than them: but as I am King of another World, I must needs honour them, because God doth most honour them, and they be Kings and Princes with me.</HI> Moreover, 'tis said, that <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, kept many Godly Ministers about him, and tho' they were but meanly habited, he not considering their out∣side, but honouring the Image of God in them, set them at his Table, and took them with him whithe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> soever he went. <HI>Maud</HI> the Wife to <HI>Henry</HI> the First, King of <HI>England,</HI> to shew her Piety, did wash, dress, wipe and kiss the Ulcers, Sores and Feet of poor peo∣ple; which her Brother seeing and disliking, said, <HI>If the King your Husband knew this, you should never kiss his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>; She replied, <HI>The Feet of the King of Heaven are to be preferred before the Lips of a King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h.</HI> Mr.

<HI>John Fox</HI> that wrote our Book of Martyrs, being asked (upon his return into <HI>England,</HI> after the Death of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>) whether he did remember such poor Christians of his former acquaintance? Answered, <HI>I forget Lords and Ladies to remember them:</HI></P>
<P>SEventhly, See the Reason why Gods People (be∣ing in the pursuit of Christ and Heaven) are &amp; must be very Serious, Diligent and Constant in holy Performances. <HI>Davids</HI> soul longed for Gods Courts, to see his Power and his Glory in his Sanctuary, <HI>Psal.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. 2. Christian, art resolved to secure thy Soul, and make sure for Heaven, go to the Ordinances of God as Christs Mother went into the Temple to find her Son, Divine Ordinances are the ways and walks of the Lord in which the Spirit works: The Bed where∣in Christ and the Spouse meet and solace themselves. Here the North and South-wind blow upon Christs Garden, and cause the Spices to flow forth The Honey-dews and Showers of Blessings under the Spouts of the Sanctuary, make their souls like <HI>Gideons</HI> Fleece, moist when others are dry and dead. Holy <HI>David</HI> had cause to say, <HI>I love the Habitation of thine House, and the Place where thine Honour dwelleth</HI>; and he desired not only sometimes to go into Gods House, but to stay there for ever, <HI>Psal.</HI> 26.8. <HI>and</HI> 27, 4. What a comforting, encouraging, and comely sight is it to see men going to Heaven, resort to the Word and pure Worship of God, as Doves to their Win∣dows, <HI>Psal.</HI> 122.1 Christians, when and where should holy men meet, but under the Ordinances of Hea∣ven, and that upon holy Sabbaths, to hear awakening Sermons, and to receive sealing Sacraments? Shall wicked men who serve the Devil, and are likely to perish forever, meet in Taverns, Ale-houses, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> houses, and at other Flesh-pleasing Recreations. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will not you meet at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sts of Wisdoms door.
<PB N="47" REF="039482_0049_10142674861A7448"/>
Here are the green and fresh Pastures in which the Souls of the Righteous flourish. And what makes so many declining Christians, (who are afraid to die, be∣cause unfit to die) but the loss of such sweet oppor∣tunities for their Souls? Now to quicken all to daily Diligence, in the fear of God consider these things.</P>
<P N="1">1. You that are most remiss and careless would be as well thought of, as the most Laborious, Lively, Watchful, Thriving Christian, to whom the Word Preached is sweet as Honey, and prefer'd above their appoinred food. There are who can willingly part with a Meals-meat, to hear a Sermon for their souls.</P>
<P N="2">2. You would gladly reap their Sick-bed Com∣forts, Joys, Refreshments, when dying and going to the everlasting World. How many careless Christians, with <HI>Ephraim,</HI> will tread out the Corn, but will not break the Clods, <HI>i. e.</HI> take pains for their Souls?</P>
<P N="3">3. You will be willing to go into Heaven with them. There were that would have gone into the Ark with <HI>Noah,</HI> who had no mind to build an Ark to save them. To close this I shall add two things:</P>
<P N="1">1. To live in the Neglect of commanded Duties, and in the Practice of known sins, will be a sting and stab to thy Soul.</P>
<P N="2">2. To be sleight, formal and heartless in Duties, will starve thy Soul. Christian, this will not make for thy comfortable Account, or prepare thee to go into Heaven with Christ.</P>

<P>SEcond Use of Caution or Dehortation; Must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope go in with Christ, but those that are innocently prepared and fitted?</P>
<P N="1">1. Take heed of leaning upon, and trusting too much to Lamps, Duties, Parts, common Grace,
<PB N="48" REF="039482_0050_101425E825A7B1B8"/>
Baptismal Regeneration, Morality, self Righte∣ousness, legal Terrour, servile fear, or any thing that may leave you short of Christ and Heaven? Think upon <HI>Chorazin</HI> and <HI>Bethsaida,</HI> and the <HI>Is∣raelites</HI> that came to the borders of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and were shut out of that good Land. How many have fallen from the Pinacle of the Temple into the place of torment? And if some go to heaven by the gates of hell, others go to hell by the gates of Heaven. Self-ignorance, carnal con∣fidence, presumption &amp; a false peace have caused thousands to perish. The peace and calm in ma∣ny a Mans conscience, is the Devils peace, <HI>Luke</HI> 11.21. It's sad to see men go singing to hell; whereas true Peace is grounded upon the Cove∣nant of Grace, the Righteousness of Christ, u∣nion and communion with Christ, likeness and conformity to Christ, and the witness of the Spirit, <HI>Isai.</HI> 10. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8 6 <HI>Heb</HI> 12 14</P>
<P N="2">2. Tremble at the thoughts of being a Sinner in <HI>Zion.</HI> Take heed of hypocrisie in the Pro∣fession of Religion. An hypocrite is a wicked man under a disguise, or in a godly mans habit; but the Vizard and Paint on mens faces will fall off when they shall stand before God, who sear∣ches the heart.</P>
<P N="3">3. Do not judge of Mens Preparedness for Hea∣ven by their Agreement with us in opinion, or by their mild and good Natures, &amp;c. We are very apt to judge of mens habits and graces, by their natural tempers, and hereby we run upon a mistake. A Dram of Evangelical Sincerity would have made the young man in the Gospel seem a great Saint. A little grace makes a great shew in some tempers, and a great deal scarce

appears in others. A little Sugar serves for sweet Wine, but there is more required to sweeten that wich is more sharp.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let young Converts not meddle too much with hard and difficult things in Religion. O∣pinions and knotty Controversies will soon en∣gross the heart, and puzzle the head, and waste much time, and hurt your Souls. Read the Word, study well your <HI>Catechisms,</HI> and be well acquainted with the Substantials and Fundamentals of Reli∣gion, which are essential to the being and well-being of your Souls in Grace. Consult with your faithful Pastors, take heed of Impostors, and be earnest with God in Prayer for the spirit of a sound mind.</P>
<P N="5">5. You that are Sincere must yield to no base Doubts, Fears and Objections of Satan and your own hearts. Deny not the Grace of God in you, which is great dishonour to God, and to the Spi∣rit of God. Hath God taken thee out of the herd of Sinners, and converted thine heart, and written thy Name in Heaven, and wilt thou at∣tempt to raze it out, and write thy Name upon the Doors of Hell? Christian, do not hearken to the Father of Lies, who works upon thy dark and melancholy humour, to rob thy soul of comfort.</P>
<P N="6">6. Let all take heed of Neglecting frequent Trial of your selves and state, left your Hearts and the Old Serpent be too hard for you. It thou would not be deceived about thy Soul and Hea∣ven, and Undone for ever, reflect and cast thine Eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon thy self. Let thine Eyes be as the Faces of the Cherubims, inward. A timely, di∣ligent and plain-hearted Examination of a mans self, is a most weighty and important Day. If

O how accurate, curious and serious should all be in enquiring about signs and marks of readiness for Christ. Now before I come to the Solution of the Question, I must let you know (by the way) whom I intend not in this use of Trial.</P>
<P N="1">1. I intend no ignorant or impious Person.</P>

These may have Evidences for Hell, they have none for Heaven. And that very man may prove his own works, here are added marks of Readiness for Christ and Heaven.</P>
<P>First, When a Beliver by Faith, Repentance, and new Obedience, hath made his Calling, E∣lection, and love of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rist sure to him, he is rea∣dy for the Marriage.

<P>SEcondly, When the King of Glory doth bring in his rich Ornaments and Hangings, and beautifie the Soul, and dwells in it, the Saint is ready to go in with Christ. Our own righteous∣ness is a filthy Garment that must be cast off. Whereas when the Kings Daughter and Spouse of Christ is made lovely by the change of Rayment or Wedding-Garment, the glorious Robe of Christ, pure, perfect, personal righteousness, she is ready. We are compleat in him, yea, all fair, and without spot. Though Christ finds his Church speckled, sullied and polluted, he doth not leave her so. <HI>I put a beautiful Crown upon thy head, and thou wert perfect through my comeliness,</HI> Ezek. 16.8, 13, 14. Ephes. 5.25, 26. This Righteousness of God doth reconcile and pacifie God. 'Tis said, that <HI>Pilate</HI> wearing Christs Coat without a Seam, pacified the wrath of angry <HI>Caesar.</HI> Christian, if by the Hand of Faith thou hast put on Christ, thou art as a Queen prepared for the Presence of the King of Glory. Where∣as without this Righteousness, there is nothing

but shameful nakedness in the best, so that you will be ready to cry out, as the <HI>Israelites</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> (when God appeared upon Mount <HI>Sinai</HI>) <HI>Let not the Lord come near us lest we die:</HI> Or you will (with <HI>Adam</HI>) rather seek to hide your selves from God than appear before him. Now soul, look in and examine thy state; the time was thou wert without God and Christ in the world, and couldst commit evil with both hands earnestly; the time was, when thy Conscience was sear'd, and Sin was no burden or shame to thee, though thou didst lick up this vomit, and wallow in the mire, and livedst in it as thy trade; but now God hath broken thy conscience, and brought thee under a sence and sentance of death, and made thee poor in spirit, and to lie down asham∣ed and confounded, because of all thy sins before him: And the Lord hath endeared Christ to thee, and caused thee to see a glorious rising Sun in his Righteousness, which the Gospel hath brought to light: tho' thou wert the greatest Sin∣ner, a poor, naked, condemned, vile, cursed Creature; thou hast that which renders thee like an Angel in the pure eyes of God, and which will quiet thy conscience, and answer to all the demands of Law and Justice. Therefore be not discouraged to die and stand before God, if he should send for thee this day or to night; Thou hast a Christ to carry with thee, and the Angels will bid All welcome to the Quire of heavenly Glory that are clad with Christs Righteousness.</P>
<P>THirdly, When the Bias, Inclination, and Streem of the Heart, that was wont to run

downward toward Sin, and the World, doth now run upward towards Christ and Heaven, the Be∣liever is actually ready If there be a Supream and Conquering affection in thy soul to Christ, and there is none above him in thine heart, so that thou canst not, wilt not be quiet, or satisfi∣ed without him, thou art fit to go in with him. The soul of the Believer doth follow so hard after God, that ye may as soon nourish and satiate a lively child with dry Breasts, and a craving Ap∣petite with Air and Words, as a Christian with∣out a Christ. Canst say as the Church in her Pathetical Suit. <HI>Cant</HI> 8.6, 7. <HI>Set me as a Seal up∣on thine heart.</HI> No Place but the heart of Sa∣viour, for a panting soul. 'Tis as if she had said, carry me in thy mind, in thy eyes, and in thine hands as a Jewel on the Breast, as a Ring on the Finger; Let me be near thine heart, and carried up and down in thy heart for ever. The Churches Love to Christ was so vehement and strong, and of that Conquering Nature, that she could no more resist it, or stand before it, than Death Fire, or the Grave could be resisted. Sinner, is Christ so lifted up in thy esteem, as to attract and draw thy soul after him. Moreover, when Christ comes in, the World must give place and go out. Is thine heart in a good measure dead to the World? Doth it appear to be (as our call∣eth it, a great Nothing) dust and shadow▪ 'Tis said of the <HI>Israelites,</HI> Acts 7.39. <HI>Their heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ed back again into</HI> Egypt; <HI>They carried</HI> Egypt <HI>into the Wilderness with them.</HI> 'Tis said of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> if she had been ript up after her death, <HI>Calice,</HI> might have been found in her heart. <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife was commanded to make hast out of <HI>Sodom,</HI> but
<PB N="56" REF="039482_0058_101426630F7A8640"/>
she left her heart behind. But how is it with thee? Art thou risen with Christ, and is the World crucified to thee, and thine heart above it? Dost look upon the World as the <HI>Jews</HI> on <HI>Babylon,</HI> as a strange Land? Canst say as <HI>David,</HI> 1 Chron. 29.15. <HI>We are strangers before thee. I am a strang∣er in the Earth,</HI> Psal 119. When the things of the World draw our affections strongly after them; Christ and Heaven cannot be so precious and desirable; but Believers know the things of the World are not worthy of their Love. They are common to good and bad, they are uncertain, they cannot save nor satisfie, they cannot keep us from sickness, nor from death, nor save our souls from hell. They are no carriage for another world. <HI>I am going to the Place</HI> (said the Martyr) <HI>where Money is no current coyn.</HI> 'Tis said of Gods Worthies, <HI>They did seek a better Country, that is an heavenly</HI>; and conffessed, <HI>They were Strangers and Pilgrims in the Earth,</HI> Heb. 11.13, 14 Now if your Treasures be in Heaven, your Affections in Heaven, and your Conversations heavenly, you may be assured of being there in a little time. Again, dost conflict with sin, and get some con∣quest over it day by day? Is thy soul estranged from all kinds of sin? sinner, canst thou be fit to go in with Christ, and hide and harbour his Enemies, and hold a truce with some secret sins?</P>
<P>The Use is for Enquiry, therefore ask thy self these Queries, Dost thou spare no <HI>Agag,</HI> a ruling sin? Withdraw no wedge of Gold or <HI>Babylonish</HI> Garment, a gainful sin? Dost make a League with no <HI>Gibeonite?</HI> Canst with <HI>Joshua</HI> destroy e∣very <HI>Canaanite,</HI> even that sin which for sweetness thou rollest under thy tongue, the stumbling-block
<PB N="57" REF="039482_0059_10142602F9751758"/>
of thine own iniquity, the <HI>Pecatum in deli∣ciis?</HI> Dost batter the Tower of <HI>Jericho?</HI> Canst break down the Bulwark of the Flesh? and say of every sin, as the <HI>Jews</HI> of Christ, <HI>Away with him, let him be crucified</HI>? thou art a prepared Soul. When Christ that glorious Sun is risen and enthron'd in the hearts that a man can say, Come and see the place where the Lord reigns; He is ready for Heaven.</P>
<P N="4">4. WHen the Believer hath so increased his Ta∣lent, that the Grain of Mustard-seed is be∣come a great Tree, (<HI>viz</HI>) He hath gotten such a stock of grace, that he can say as the rich man of his Ground, <HI>I have much laid up,</HI> he is ready. Three things Saints do ardently desire in order to this Fitness:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Grace in the reality of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Grace in the fulness of it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The gracious Presence, <HI>Let my Beloved come into his Garden,</HI> said the Church.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Christians, you must not only have Grace habitu∣ally, but actually, in its most lively and vigorous exercise, to prepare you for Heaven. Grace is a Talent sent down from Heaven, and put into our hands to trade with. When the Oil is in the Vessel, and the Lamps burn bright, <HI>i. e.</HI> divine Grace shines in the Soul like Stars in the Night; the Christ∣ian is in a fit posture to meet Christ. Christian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ Why should you take up your stand in Religion and not go on to Perfection. Even as <HI>Apelles</HI> upon all his Pict∣ures would write, <HI>Faciebat, non facit,</HI> You must not suffer your Lamps to wax dim, and your Oyl to wast. A Dwarf is a monster in Nature. As there are some decayed in their Trades and Estates, and others grow poor and consumptive in their Bodies, so are there withered and decayed Professors in every Soci∣ety,
<PB N="58" REF="039482_0060_1014266631C4C0D0"/>
the new man is very weak and feeble in very many. What are become of the graces, comforts, and delights of the Spirit? This streem doth not run, Rivers of Living Water do not flow out of our Bellies: Where is the old stock, and the new in∣crease? That plenty and fulness of the Spirit, that must ripen our Souls and make us ready? If grace like the house of <HI>David</HI> did revive, and wax stronger and stronger in you, it would cure your Stupor and Security: and give you (bear with the expression) a fresh Start, or new Alarm for Heaven. That grace is not in the gaining hand, is most apparent by your letting down your Watch, and falling asleep. By your Listlessness to Duties, and want of Life, and affection in them, by them, by the prevalency of cor∣ruption, and decay of Godly sorrow for sin, and in∣ward peace, by the blotting of your Evidences for heaven, and want of communion with Christ, who stands aloof off from the withered &amp; decayed Christi∣an. Friend, dost then not hear the Lord say, I have something against thee because thou hast lost thy first Love? We read of the first days of <HI>David,</HI> and of the first Ripe Fruits; The first Fruits of the Spirit; the love of the Espousals. But where shall we find it? What is become of the sweet Incense of Pray∣er and Praise, thou wast wont to send up to heaven? The time was, thou couldst be early and late with God by solemn and secret Prayer, and direct, and dart up thy soul to heaven often in a day, by oc∣casional ejaculatory Prayers, Is not this golden Lamp gone out? Was there never a Spirit of Pray∣er among Gods People in this Nation? What is become of that inward affection in Prayer, where shall we find it? Is all our Religion resolv'd into forms and formality? How little spiritual Wor∣ship hath God by the best of us, who will accept of no other Worship? Where are those frequent
<PB N="59" REF="039482_0061_10142604866E5108"/>
Visits from Christ in his Ordinances you have found? Where are the choice fruits in Christs Gar∣den? You that, are planted in the House of the Lord, must flourish in the Courts of our God, and cast forth your Roots like <HI>Lebanon. Grow in Grace, and you shall come into glory,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.11.</P>
<Q><HI>Question.</HI> Do all Gods People (who shall go in with Christ) die in a comfortable condition, and with <HI>Moses</HI> see the Promised Land: or have they a Prospect of their heavenly Country?</Q>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> No: Scripture and Experience prove the contrary. And here I shall lay down some Particu∣lars, both to quicken and support Gods people, whose souls seem to be at the very point of despair.</P>
<P N="1">1. The state of a godly man, and his future feli∣city is not to be adjudged by the manner of his death, or his sensible comforts at the end of his days, but by the general course and tendency of his life. A Ship that comes home richly laden may meet with a storm at the Harbours mouth. <HI>It mat∣ters not much</HI> (saith Dr. <HI>Harris</HI> to his holy disconso∣late wife,) <HI>whether comfort comes an hour before death, or an hour after death.</HI> A godly man may die mourn∣ing; God may give him the Garment of gladness in Heaven, for his spirit of heaviness in Earth. A holy Minister of this Nation was wont to say <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>never tasted the sweet of Religion all his Life,</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng Assurance of Heaven.</P>
<P>Secondly, Believing doth precede sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g▪ the direct act of Faith goes before the reflect act of Faith, the Faith of Adherence before the Faith of Evidence, <HI>Eph.</HI> 1.13.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The Kingdom of Glory is not promised to Assurance, but to Faith and Repentance. There are many now in heaven that were not assured of it
<PB N="60" REF="039482_0062_101426074BD86110"/>
till they come thither. And how many tender se∣rious souls are there who prize none in the World like a Christ, who love him with all the regards of the Lord, who hate the Enemies of his Scepter with a perfect hatred, who would not willingly offend or grieve him in the least measure, who cleave unto him as the only Rock of Salvation, who would not re∣linquish their interest in him for Millions of Worlds. And yet they weep with <HI>Mary,</HI> because they cannot see their Lord. They conflict with fears and doubts day and night, and have not that reflective Evidence and Assurance that he is their Christ their God. The hour (said one) in which Assurance comes is sel∣dom, and its stay is short. Those that have it, have it not at all times; as there are degrees of Grace, so there are different measures of Assurance. The Jewels of Grace may lie hid in the close and dark Cabinet of the heart, until the Spirit shine upon its own Grace, The choicest Flowers have their Roots out of sight. There are who be as truly in the favour of God, as the Angels themselves, but they are very doubt∣ful of it. 'Tis reported that two Ministers came to visit a godly woman, who was weeping over her Child in the Cradle: and being asked by one of the Ministers the cause of griefs, she said, Because I have profest Religion more than twenty years, and am not Assured of my Salvation. One of the Ministers asked the woman, Whose child is this in the Cra∣dle? she answered, Mine, but said he, Doth the Christ know you are the Mother of it? She replied, No: which question was a consolation to this de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> woman. <HI>The Lord knoweth those that are his.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, A man may come safe to heaven without Assurance, but not without Grace and inherent▪ Ho∣liness. But remember this, the more careless and in∣different a man or woman is about the assurance of Heaven, the further off he is from it. Therefore
<PB N="61" REF="039482_0063_1014260AA1A40F80"/>
prize it highly, press after it vehemently, if thou wouldst attain it.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Great castings down, and soul-distresses, do often usher in much joy and inward peace. As a dark misty Night goes before a bright Morning, and a cold long Winter before a Fruitful Spring. Some that have been brought down to the Valley of the shadow of Death, have also been carried up to the Mount of Transfiguration. The Spirit of Bondage doth lead the way to the Spirit of Adoption, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. A Christian that is poor and contrite in his own sense, may have his Soul in a prosperous condition. And 'tis a great Faith to cleave to Christ and the Promises, when man hath little comfort. <HI>The time may come</HI> (saith a great Divine) <HI>when the Faith of Adherence may be all in all.</HI> Tho' thy soul is cast down, assurance may be at the door. When <HI>Mary Magdelen</HI> was weep∣ing, and thought her Lord was risen and gone, Christ was behind her, <HI>Joh.</HI> 20.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Saints do not usually die in a Swoon or Spiritual Consumption. If <HI>Eutichus</HI> fall down dead, he must rise up again. So God will one way or o∣ther recover his declining people, and revive his work in them, and make them ready. Consider, it greatly concerns all that will live and die comfortably, and enjoy Christ and Heaven Eternally, to press after certainty, and to make ready. Are all our desirable and best things in the world uncertain, and shall our Souls and Heaven be so too? In things of infinite less value, men are for certainty, and why not in this? The Usurer would have Money told twice, who was wont to say to his man, It is good to be sure. In case of Money lent, men will have double Security, by Bond and Land In <HI>London,</HI> there is an Ensuring-Office for Merchandize. And will you have no care to preserve your Souls; If certainty of Salvation were to be bought, <HI>God knows, if I had ten Earths</HI> (said a very Holy and Learned Divine) <HI>I would part with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for it.</HI></P>

<HEAD>SECT. VIII.</HEAD>
<P>THE 4. <HI>Ʋse.</HI> is to perswade all who have any regard to God and their dear souls, to be in readiness. Awake out of sleep, and get your Garments on, Oyl in the Vessel, Loins girt, your Lamps burning, that you may be ready, and the Lord find you so, as well as men think you so.</P>
<P>This plain <HI>Ʋse</HI> of Exhortation is directed to two sorts of Persons.</P>
<P N="1">1. Those who are wholly unready for Death and Judgment.</P>
<P N="2">2. To those who are in part ready, but not so ready as they should be, who must stand before the Lord: And as they themselves another day will wish they had been.</P>
<P N="1">1. Those who are wholly unready to go in with Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> Are there any such? yea, more then a few. How many here, and now read these Sermons, do know themselves unready, and will not prepare: whose Conscience tell them if they should die, and stand before God in their pre∣sent condition, they are undone for ever? If they should receive a Summons to come to Gods Bar this day, or this night, we might here them cry, out, Spare me a little longer, Lord, spare me the Prince, and me the Priest▪ Spare me the Fa∣ther, and me the Son; Spare me the Mother, and me the Daughter; Spare me the rich man, and me the poor man▪ Spare me the Master, and and me the Servant; Spare me the young man, and me the old man; Spare me the Mistress, and
<PB N="63" REF="039482_0065_10142610AC77CA00"/>
me the Maid; Spare me the Learned, and me the Unlearned man; me the sickly man, and me the healthy man; Lord for one month, or year more, before I go to the place from whence I shall never return.</P>
<P>To open and Illustrate, <HI>viz.</HI> that there are a∣bundance unready. Let me ask you, What think you of the Infidel World, the Uncircumcised in heart and flesh? How many Kingdoms and Na∣tions are there, who know not the way to a life of Immortality by a Mediator? These are the Devils Free-hold, without hope, and stumble down to Hell in the dark. But to leave the poor Pagans, (who perish for want of vision) and to come nearer to our selves: What, vast multi∣tudes are there in the Christian World, and that among baptized Persons, who enjoy the means of Salvation, and are altogether unready, for Christ and Heaven.</P>
<P>To descend to Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Those that are grosly ignorant of God and Jesus Christ, <HI>viz.</HI> Ignorant of his Nature, Per∣son, Offices, they have neither a head or hearty knowledge of Christ. Their minds are blind and understandings darkned. The first Work God doth to prepare sinners for Heaven, is to open their eyes, and to bring them into the Light of Life. But to these, God, Christ, Faith, Repen∣tance is a mystery. A woman being asked by a Minister, Whether Christ by whom she expect∣ed Salvation, was a Man or a Woman? Answer∣ed, She could not tell. Are such ready? shall they be saved who are under the power of the Prince of Darkness? <HI>Righteous Father</HI> (said Christ) <HI>the World hath not known thee,</HI> John 17.25. And
<PB N="64" REF="039482_0066_1014261242F12C80"/>
truly Heaven is no more in Hell than preparati∣on for it is in an ignorant Person. Those who are made fit for Heaven, are delivered from the Power of Darkness, <HI>Col.</HI> 1, 12, 13. Under the Law God would not accept of blind Sacrifices, <HI>Deut.</HI> 15.21. <HI>Psal.</HI> 11.27. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4 3. O then, cry after Knowledge, and lift up thy voice for Understanding; Take hold of Instruction, and let her not go, for she is thy Life, <HI>Prov.</HI> 2.2. Without knowledge the heart cannot be good, nor fit for God and Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. What shall we think of those that rest only in outward Priviledges, who being born of Blood, and of the will of the Flesh! And by timely E∣ducation have attained the knowledge of sound principles and way of Salvation, but were never awakened, convinced, and under any distress a∣bout their souls; are these ready for Christ and Heaven? <HI>Jo.</HI> 8.39. <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.9. <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.17. <HI>The whole need not the Physitian,</HI> said Christ. Those who are strangers to the Spirit of Bondage, and Pangs of the new Birth, who never saw those treasures of wrath due to sin, he that was never heard to say, I am unclean, I am cast down, I am heavy Laden, I am lost, I am undone, I die, I I am damned, if Christ and Mercy come not spee∣dily. Without conviction there can be no con∣version. A woman travels and then brings forth a Child, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.36.16 30. Many steal quietly to Hell, few or none go smoothly to Heaven. Men commonly pass thorow the straits before they en∣ter into the Harbour or Haven of Rest. The Lash of the Law is our School-Master to bring<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Christ, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.24 But alas, thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> deluded with a cheap conversion, that ne∣ver
<PB N="65" REF="039482_0067_101426171013AD48"/>
had a sick night or a pained-soul for sin, In∣deed all are not converted with a voice of Thun∣der, are brought to Christ with a mighty Rushing Wind, and terrible Tempest and Consternation of Spirit. Christ may steal secretly into the heart, as into <HI>Lydia,</HI> but tis very seldom. Se∣curity sends many to Hell, whereas a sore Consci∣ence is better then a seared Conscience, and a burning-Ague is more hopeful than a Lethargy.</P>
<P N="3">3. What think you of the <HI>Belialists</HI> and <HI>Damme</HI>'s, who curse <HI>Jacob</HI> and defie <HI>Israel? viz</HI> that deride holiness, and make a sport of sin, and fly in the face of their Creator, and dare God to kill &amp; damn them every day. There are who live as if they were sent into the World to do nothing but sin, serve the Devil, and ruine themselves. What droves and multitudes of libidinous profane per∣sons are there in every place? How is the broad way crowded with men of corrupt Minds and cursed Practices, who drop poison as they go, and ride post to Hell? These scarlet-sinners will break thorow all dangers to have their lusts satisfied. As <HI>Nero</HI>'s Mother said, <HI>Let him kill me so he may Reign.</HI></P>
<Q>Occidat modo imperet.</Q>
<P>Let the Devil damn us, so we may have the sweet of Sin. These do not believe a day of Eternal Retri∣bution after death. And are they prepared for Christ and Heaven, who are ready for the Devil &amp; Hell?</P>
<P N="4">4.What are the Spiritually Barren under all the Dressings and Dews of Heaven, &amp; the abundance of Apostates in heart &amp; practice? We may take up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Lamentation upon the Death of <HI>Saul</HI> &amp; <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and say with grief, <HI>How are the mighty fallen</HI>? The Falling Sickness hath been very rife, and an Epidemical
<PB N="66" REF="039482_0068_101426189926EB48"/>
Disease among us. These are days of as many in∣stances of Apostacy and Back-sliding, and that from as high and glorious pitches as any Age since the A∣postles days can parallel. How many Stars have been cast from Heaven? How many Trees plucked up by the Roots? Many seeming Stars are discovered to be but Meteors▪ and now gone down in obscurity. Are these ready for Christ? The Penny will not be paid until the Evening; the End crowns the Action. He that presseth on, and runs to the end of the Race shall have the Prize, <HI>Ezek</HI> 3.20. <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.12, 13. <HI>Heb</HI> 6.4.11, 38, 39. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.20. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 9.24. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.10.</P>
<P N="5">5. What think you of those Millions of Unholy Worldlings, who trade altogether for the Earth, and lay up no Treasure in Heaven? Their Gold, Silver, Houses, Lands, Wives, Children, are their god. They desire no better heaven than to be perpetuated in the Honours▪ Profits and Pleasures of the World. <HI>I would not leave my part in</HI> Paris, <HI>for my part in</HI> Pa∣ridise, said a prophane Wretch. A Nobleman of <HI>Vi∣enna,</HI> at his great Feast, and in the midst of his Jol∣lity, said, <HI>If God would leave me my Riches, and suffer me to live but a Thousand Years to take my Pleasure, I would willingly leave God his Heaven.</HI> The Children of <HI>Reuben</HI> and <HI>Gad,</HI> being enriched with the spoil of their Enemies, and come into a good Land, desired to have it for their Inheritance, and not to go into the Promised Land, <HI>Numb.</HI> 31.1, 2, 3, 4. Are they prepar'd for Heaven, who can take the World for their Portion? <HI>Mat.</HI> 19.23.</P>
<P N="6">6. What are the Thousands and Ten Thousands of Christ and Mercy-sleighting Sinners, many of which will not come within the sound of the Silver▪ Trumpets, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to wait upon God in the Use of Means. There are who seem to be resolved to throw their Souls to Hell. God commands to do no Mur∣der, and Self-Murder is wondred at, because the care
<PB N="67" REF="039482_0069_1014261C36CA4690"/>
of Life, and fear of Death is planted in mans Na∣ture; but Self-Destruction. Self-Damnation, is very common. There are who will say, We are no Thieves, nor Murderers nor Adulterers, or Drunkards, but to be Christ-sleighters is worse, and more Damnable. This made Christ grieve, sigh, weep, in a melting manner over <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and his com∣passionate bewailing of them, was enough to turn Stones into Tears, nevertheless, they wilfully re∣fused him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23.37. This will be sad, like the impenitent Thief to perish, and a Saviour by his side. We read of a whole City, upon the loss of their Swine, intreated Christ to be gone out of their Coasts, <HI>Mat.</HI> 8 <HI>ult.</HI> Are these ready to wear the Crown of Glory?</P>
<P N="7">7. Add to these, those, (and not a few) who hold not the head, but Execrable, and Abominable opi∣nions, which they pertinaciously defend. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make not the Person of the Mediator the object of their faith and hope, and with the <HI>Sadduces</HI> deny the Resurrection of the Body, Are they prepar'd to go in with Christ? Heresie is reckoned among the worst of the sins of the Flesh: 'tis a Spiritual Witch∣craft, and a covert, close way to hell. Not only wicked practises, but corrupt opinions will damn mens souls, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2 <HI>Paul</HI> told the erronious <HI>Gala∣tions</HI> they were bewitched; when mens Cattel, or the bodies of their Children are bewitched, how sad is it, but 'tis more dreadful to have souls bewit∣ched. There are an abundance of Virtiginous Le∣prous heads in this Nation. Head-diseases are hardly cured, they do often kill. Ye therefore Beloved, seeing ye know these things before, be∣ware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.17.</P>

These do not consider that more die Young, than live Long; and how little Graves, small Bones, and Skulls of all sizes are in our Burial-places? Our Proverb is, <HI>That the Lambs-skin many times come to the Market, before the Sheeps-skin.</HI> The Young men are Dead; 'tis said of <HI>Jobs</HI> Sons, <HI>Job</HI> 1.17. Again, En∣quire about the time of mens Conversion, and you will find few Converted in Old Age. 'Tis almost a Prodigy to see an Old Man or Woman convert and turn to God. Moreover, those who put off their Preparation for Heaven, do not know what a life of Joy and Pleasure they live, who have tasted the sweet of Religion, and gotten Evidence for Heaven early.

The wise Virgins thought well of them, and that they had been prepared.

Heaven, remember who saith, <HI>My Son give me thy heart,</HI> Prov. 2.26. Be holy and thou shalt be accepted. Sinner, thou canst not make too much hast to Heaven.

<P>Take these Incentives.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Church is called a Virgin, Christ the Bridegroom, and the flourishing Age of Youth must be the best time to make this Match. The Birds chuse their Mates in the Spring; the young Bees, when thrust out by the old ones, work in the Summer for Honey in the Winter. The Marriages of the Aged, when men should think of a Grave, are wondred at; and somewhat rare. Sinner, the time of Youth is the choicest and fit∣test season for thy Soul. Now, thine affections, <HI>viz</HI> Desire, Love, Joy, Delight, (the wings and feet of thy Soul, to carry thee to the arms and bosom of Christ) are ripe and flourish.

or Priority we must have ever respect unto in this grand Affair; as the Woman came to Christs Grave early, <HI>Luk</HI> 24 1 so early must we get Grace.

To trade with God for the Oil of Grace, and to prepare for Heaven early, is the richest Trade in the World. Say with him who was pious in his Youth, and could tell what God had done for his Soul, <HI>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? O God, thou art my God, early will I seek thee,</HI> Psal. 62.1. <HI>&amp;</HI> 73.25. Do as the Primitive Christians, who gave themselves to the Lord, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.5. It may be thou art Poor in the world, and hast not Gold, Frankincense and Myrrh to offer unto thy God, nor a thousand Rams, and ten thousand Rivers of Oyl, yet thou hast an Heart which is a Present for a Prince, a Gift for the Great God. <HI>Lord, such as I have I give thee</HI>: and 'tis thine own, my body and my soul I resign to thee, <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.1. This is the Male; do not bring the Blind, the Lame, and the Maimed; lest he say to thee, as to those sacrilegious Persons, <HI>Go offer it to thy Governour see whether he will accept of it</HI>; where thou hast spent the best of thy Floure, bestow thy Bran. Let the World, Flesh and Devil, that have had thy Youth, have the Snuffs and dregs of Old Age too. Sinner, stay till old Age, and no thanks to part with thy sins; Sin will leave thee: when the Oil is wasted the Lamp will go out. Then stand forth Young man, and say to God as <HI>Ahab</HI> to <HI>Benhadad, I am thine, and all that I have.</HI> My

Break off from the Devil and Sin early, and gather up this heavenly hidden <HI>Mannah</HI> of Divine Grace in the Morning, and go forward, and thou wilt be a Mother in <HI>Israel,</HI> or a Father in Gods Family.

But to be the first Drunkard, the first Adulterer, the first Persecutor, or the first inventer of fan∣tastick, disguised Fashions, and wicked Practices, deserves to be branded with Infamy &amp; Reproach.

But what need such Haste? The Thief went from the Cross to the Crown the same day. Do not trust to that, it was but one Thief, and he a Prodigy, and truly Penitent.

He hath his Devices, his Wiles, his Depths, and all imployed to impede and obstruct this work. Here I shall endeavour to detect some of the stra∣tagems of this active and malicious Adversary the Devil.</P>
<P><HI>Q How doth Satan hinder this Work?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. By suggesting delays and putting off our duty: and to this end he will perswade.</P>
<P N="1">1. Though it may and must be done, it is too soon, another season is better than the present time.</P>
<P N="2">2. That there is no life so sweet as a life of sin and sensuality.</P>
<P N="3">3. That preparation for heaven is a short and easie work, and may be done hereafter, or when we will. Sinner, if thou dost think it easie to repent, believe, and change thy heart, and secure heaven at any time. Let me ask thee, Canst make an other World, and keep the whole Laws? Canst raise the dead, or live here for ever? Thou mayst do one as well as the other.</P>
<P N="2">2. By withdrawing men from the use of pow∣erful and awakening means, in which they may meet with Christ and be converted.</P>
<P N="3">3. By representing the difficulty and impossibility of a strict and pious life. To insinuate and fasten this temptation, the Devil will make men believe,</P>
<P N="1">1. That there is no absolute necessity of such preciseness.</P>
<P N="2">2. That men may live ill, and die well. Go in the way to Hell, and come to Heaven.</P>
<P N="3">3. That no man can live such a life, if so, 'tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sad, pensive life, and no way Eligible, or to be chosen.</P>
<P N="4">4. By raising prejudice and evil thoughts in mens
<PB N="81" REF="039482_0083_10142640DA9A45B0"/>
minds against the Preachers and Professors of the Gospel: such as these:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the best are not so good towards God, as they seem to the World, but false and counter∣feit.</P>
<P N="2">2. That thy sin is secret, and in corners, though not openly, and in the face of the Sun: And be∣cause of the grosser faults, and miscarriage of some, and the weaknesses, infirmities, and passions of o∣thers, they will think well of none. Here note, 'tis a cursed design of Hell, to put bad men upon the profession of Religion on purpose to disgrace it, and render it odious to the World.</P>
<P N="5">5. By abusing and misapplying the Doctrine of Election and Predestination, so as to infer and draw from it, wild and desperate conclusions.</P>
<P N="6">6 By suggesting to poor desponding souls, that the day of Grace, and time of preparation for Hea∣ven is over.</P>
<P N="7">7. By corrupting and poysoning mens Judgments with heretical and damnable Opinions and Princi∣ples. There's many a mans head hath brought him to hell. To instance,</P>
<P N="1">1. That Scripture is not of Divine Authority; That the World was from Eternity; That Religion is a meer Fiction; That Regeneration, Faith, Re∣pentance, Communion with Christ is but moral ver∣tue; That Men may be saved of any Religion; That Hell is a Bug-bear, and Heaven a Fools Paradise. But let God and his Word be true, and every Blas∣phemer a Liar.</P>
<P N="8">8 By calming and quieting Mens Conscience with an out-side and carnal Religion, and good purposes.</P>
<P N="9">9. By proposing false Grounds and Evidences for Heaven, <HI>viz.</HI> That Conviction, and legal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is Conversion, that an honest, civil, sober life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ and Faith in him, will bring men to Heaven
<PB N="82" REF="039482_0084_10142645C8F5B380"/>
These are the Fig-leaves Men sow together, who walk in the sparks and light of their own fire, <HI>Isa.</HI> 50.</P>
<P N="10">10. By suggesting the numberless number of non-Professors, and these many of them honourable, rich, learned, wise men, and that it will be of dange∣rous consequence openly to own &amp; practise Religion, and therefore they cannot prepare for Christ, and purchase Heaven at so dear a rate. Sinner, let me tell thee, whatever Satan doth make thee believe, thou hast no cause to take a Minute rest, while un∣ready.</P>

I might have had a Farm, a Mannor, rich Apparel, delicate Fare, many Servants, and Attendants, but Sins, Snares, and the Curse of God on all, and at last have gone to Hell. Moreover, the Assurance of going in with Christ will deaden the heart to the World, and make a man willing to leave all for Christ; yea, it will reconcile a godly man to the sharpest Providences, and severest stroke of Gods Hand. It will make a Christian suffer willingly, and bear the Cross patiently and comfortably. When that great Sufferer look'd up to his exceeding eternal weight of Glory, his afflictions seemed light.

In fine, due Preparation for going in with Christ, will be an effectual means to prevent that active adversary the Devil, who im∣proves all opportunities and advantages against Gods poor people, especially their weaknesses, when they are brought low in body and mind too. 'Tis said of the natural Serpent, <HI>Non nisi moriens in long am producitur,</HI> he is never at his full length till dying.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mo.</HI> 5.</NOTE>CHrists long absence, Gods unwearied patience, and all the calls, threatnings, warnings and alarms of the Word are, that men should make ready for him, and escape the wrath that is to come. Why are means and Ministers con∣tinued, and the offers of Grace by the Gospel re∣newed, but to bring Souls over unto Christ, and safe to Heaven? He sent forth other Servants, <HI>Matt.</HI> 22. The first in the Morning, others at the sixth, ninth and eleventh hour. Why is the Cry at mid∣night, but to raise and rouze up the sleepier Virgins to make Ready? There are four Cries God makes use on, to startle and awaken men to mind their souls business.</P>
<P N="1">1. The first is, the cry or voice of the Spirit, which is a more secret and still voice to excite us unto our duty. The Holy Ghost saith, <HI>To day, The Spirit saith, Come, Rev. ult.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. There is the cry of the Word. <HI>This is as the Voice of the Trumpet,</HI> Isa. 58 1. <HI>John the Baptist</HI> was a Cryer. <HI>Go and cry in the Ears of</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>said the Lord,</HI> Jer. 2.2.</P>

<P N="4">4. There is also the cry of Conscience. All which serve to prompt us to our duty, and prepare us for Eternity. Christ had kindled the fire upon the Earth, and burnt it, and set up his Tribunal, and sounded the Trumpet of Judgment long before, but that he is willing to save undone sinners, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.9. <HI>His long-suffering to us-ward, is not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to Repen∣tance.</HI></P>
<Q>Mora sponsi poeditentiae tempus est.</Q>
<P>The delay of the Bridegroom, is the time of re∣pentance. There's not a Sabbath-day, nor a Sacra∣ment-day, nor a Sermon-day, after the Judgment-day. Now God warns by his Judgments, waits to be gracious, calls by his Ministers, strives by his Spirit: and you may be welcome to him. And upon your Repentance, and closing with Christ, you shall be justified, pardoned, accepted, and taken into the Marriage, and Crowned: But stay a little longer, and the Door is shut, and then all your prayers, cryes, tears, will be fruitless, O sinner, arise; make haste and return unto the Lord before it be too late.</P>

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. Christs coming seems long to Atheistical mockers, who say, <HI>Where is the Promise of his coming?</HI> 2 Pet. 3.3, 4.</P>
<P N="2">2. To his suffering Members. Their cry to Vin∣dictive Justice is, <HI>Lord, how long?</HI> Psal. 94.3. <HI>Revel.</HI> 6.10. If these days of sin and misery should not be shortned, no Flesh could be saved.</P>

But count upon it, he will not fail in coming. 'Tis the great Article of our Creed, <HI>That Christ shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</HI> Moreover, he told his tender-hearted, and dearly beloved Disciples, (who were sad at the tiding of his going from them) he would come and see them again. And he hath, according to his Promise, ever since sent another to supply his room, to teach, refresh and comfort them until he comes, and to keep the recent memory of him in their minds. He hath also once and again presented himself to the view of his suffering Saints, as ready to come and avenge their cause for them, <HI>Acts</HI> 7.55. <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.13, 18. And he hath often met them in his Ordinances, and holy Appointments, as an Answer of their holy Prayers; <HI>He is come,</HI> saith the Martyr; Many a token of his love, comforts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> converse, and sweet meeting with Christ his Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hath had already, all which assures and tells <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that he will be with us in a little time, <HI>He that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come, will come, and will not tarry,</HI> Heb 10.</P>

The Bridegrooms departure was not upon a differ∣ence, or divorce, he did not leave his Bride with a purpose to return no more.

<P>LOOK as for thy life, that thy beginning in Religion be right: Then are those beginnings hopeful, when the Spirit of God in the Ministry of the Word, or any other means of grace works upon us, so that we be sure to lay a good Foun∣dation at first. An error at the Threshold of the House, or first setting out in the profession and practise of Religion is very dangerous, like a defect in the Foundation, that threatens the fall of the whole Fabrick, like a leak in the Ship that in∣dangers the Ship and Men too; or like a flaw in a mans Deed, that threatens the loss of the whole Estate. There will be a beginning and an end alike, when Grace is radicated, and the operation of the Spirit enters deep into the soul: Whereas a child mishapen in the Womb, is ever afterwards a Mon∣ster.</P>

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This right beginning may include th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> things, according to which compare and try your selves:</P>

<P>WOuld you be ready to go in with Christ, cast off all Incumbrances, and make hast in your way to Heaven: Heaven is a glorious Crown, we must strip and strain, run and win it: How can a man run with a Burthen on his Shoulders, and Fetters on his Feet?

Vessel of thy Soul, and prevent thy Shipwrack. The burthen of worldly cares, the lime-twigs to our wings and affections, and (which sticks to us as Pitch and Tar to the sides of the Ship) are the bane of many a soul. The glittering things of the World which sparkle in our eyes, and attract our hearts, are but like rotten wood or Glow-worms, which shine in the dark: <HI>Set not thine heart upon the Ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> said <HI>Samuel</HI> to <HI>Saul; Regard not your stuff,</HI> said <HI>Joseph</HI> to his Brethren.</P>
<P>Christians, you are going to Mount <HI>Sion,</HI> value not your moveables. We may carry the World, and the pleasing objects of it, our Children and Relations in our hands, but not in our hearts.

<P>Christians, startle at gross and scandalous Sins, that look with a black and ugly Aspect, as Murther, Adultery, Damming, Swearing, Theft: but the World may be welcome, though the immoderate love of the World is at contrary and inconsistent with Grace as the fore-mentioned sins.

<P>BE diligent, constant and serious in the use of every known means and practice of every com∣manded duty. If you will go in to heaven here∣after, you must follow the Lord here. Christian, with greatest care and conscience practise these four duties to make ready for Christ.</P>
<P N="1">1. With love and delight attend the Ministry of the Word, wait on it, as the poor man at the Pool for healing, <HI>and so hear that thy Soul may live. Mary</HI> attending upon the Word is commended by Christ. <HI>The Gospel</HI> (saith Dr. <HI>Sibs</HI>) <HI>is a Chariot to carry Christ up and down in the World</HI>; resolve to follow this Chariot, be often under the Influences of Heaven, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at the Sun of Righteousness may let down his warm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon you. The Spirit of God in the Mini∣stry of the Word hath converted many a Soul, and prepared them for Heaven.</P>
<P>Secondly, Let the holy Sabbath or Lords day be always welcome to thee. <HI>How glad am I,</HI> said one, <HI>when I see the first light of the Lords day</HI>: Inure thy self to the strict Observation of that high and holy day of God, keep it as for thy life, that at the end of every Lords day, thou mayst be fit to enter upon an eternal Sabbath: how seasonable and sweet is it when Gods Spirit and our Hearts meet in the Duties we perform. <HI>I was in the Spirit,</HI> saith <HI>John, on the Lords day.</HI></P>
<P>Three Duties in Religion are very hard, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. we watch the heart. 2. To pray without wan∣dring
<PB N="109" REF="039482_0111_1014268F6154E9C8"/>
and distraction; and 3. To keep the Lords Day well.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be frequent and affectionate in the celebration of that most useful and glorious Ordinance the Lords Supper, by which we must shew forth the Lords death till he come. And if you would feed on, and feast with Christ in this blessed Banquet, of which Christ is both the Master and the Matter, do three things: First, always come with due Pre∣paration. Secondly, with high expectation. Thirdly, when come, make application.</P>
<P N="4">4. Be very solemn and serious in thy Closet-Visits, <HI>viz.</HI> be early and late with God by secret Prayer. The great <HI>Roman</HI> Captain <HI>Scipio,</HI> before he under∣took any business, was wont first to enter the Ca∣pital, pretending a consulting with the gods; several Ministers being at Table where the Question was asked, <HI>What was the best Trade</HI>? One answered, <HI>Begging,</HI> meaning Prayer. Wouldst thou be pre∣pared to go in with Christ, follow him with un∣utterable groans from day to day for Grace, and fitness for Heaven, speak out thine heart before God, as <HI>Hannah</HI> did when she obtained a Son. The Voice is not absolutely necessary in Prayer, but the Heart: It matters not though the door of the Lips be shut, so the closet of the Heart be open. When thou art going into thy Chamber, or come into thy Closet to bow before the Lord, observe these Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Search and find out thine heart, and say, I am going about a great work, to beg Grace to prepare me for Heaven, Where art thou my heart?</P>
<P N="2">2. Summon in thine heart; 'tis often out of the way, send a word of command after it, and fetch it in.</P>
<P N="3">3. Stir and lift up thine heart; the heart is like bell that will make no Musick till it be raised
<PB N="110" REF="039482_0112_1014269292032520"/>
up, like green Wood that will not burn without much blowing.</P>
<P N="4">4. Fix thy Heart on God to whom thou prayest, and on Jesus Christ in whose Name thou dost it. Should a Man make a suit to the King for his life, and not mind his business? The most High looks upon the heart.</P>
<P N="5">5. Watch thine heart, and look for a return of thy Prayer, otherwise thine heart will give thee the slip, and thy Prayer is lost. Prayer one com∣pares to a Chain, one end of which is fastened to the Believers tongue, the other to Gods Ear, who is called, <HI>A God hearing Prayer.</HI> Say with <HI>Job, I will fill my mouth with Arguments.</HI> When <HI>David</HI> had taken good order for building the Temple, he directs his Prayer to God to prepare their hearts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> had a custom to ask nothing of their gods, but things of weight and moment. Is not this of greatest concernment? Try what Prayer can do, plead before God by Ardent and Importunate Prayer to make thee ready, render thy self to God as an undone Creature to new mould, form and fashion thine Heart for himself; carry thy Heart to him on thy Knees, as <HI>Moses</HI> brought the two Tables of Stone after the first were bro∣ken and defaced, for God to Write what he Will. Say Lord, I have heard what a dismal, dark, dread∣ful place Hell is, and what a blessed and glorious place Heaven is, and yet I am not prepared for it. This heart of mine I have had on many a sick-bed, and sentence of Death, and under many a Sermon, and sometimes it hath been startled, and awakned, then I have purposed and promised to repent, pray, leave my sins, to part with the World, and to be∣come a new man, but I have acted the Hypocrite, all this is come to nothing; Lord do that in me and for me, which none but a God can do.</P>

<P>LEt it be thy constant and greatest care to keep a good Conscience in all things. Stand off from iniquity; see that there be no allowed reigning sin in thine heart and life: God will know it, whose eyes are pure and in every place. Sinner, it will be bad looking God in the face with a galled, guilty Conscience, and enemy in thy bo∣som. <HI>If our heart condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knoweth all things,</HI> 1 Joh. 3.19, 20.</P>
<Q>Vox Conscientiae est Vox Dei.</Q>
<P>Conscience is Gods Vice-gerent in us, and it will be a friend or a fury, and cause an Hell within, or a Heaven without. 'Tis dreadful for a man to carry Hell about with him, the Evidence of his Condemnation in his own breast. Whereas the in-witness of a good Conscience will be as a Wall of Brass to a Believer, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.12 <HI>For our rejoycing is this, the testimony of our Conscience, that in simplici∣ty and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the Grace of God we have had our conversation in the World, and more abundantly to you wards.</HI> Keep this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd of Paradise always in thy bosom, that thine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eart may not reproach and smite thee.</P>
<P>A guilty Conscience representeth Death and Judg∣ment dreadful, and terrible to great men; even to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hings, the gods of this World. <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, after the murther of his own two innocent Ne∣phews, had fearful dreams, insomuch that he did often leap out of his bed in the dark, and run about the Chamber, even distracted with horrour,

as if all the Furies of Hell were hanging about him. So <HI>Charles</HI> the Ninth of <HI>France,</HI> after the bloody Massacre of <HI>Paris,</HI> was so inwardly terri∣fied, that he was every right laid to sleep, and awakened with a set of Musitians. Sins against Conscience, are nearest to the Devils sin. O how astonishing is this, when a man dying must say, (if he speaks the truth) I have rebell'd against my Creator. I have served the Devil, I have satis∣fied my Lusts, and now I go to Eternal torments.</P>

Follow the Holy Examples of former Saints, viz. <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 18.19. <HI>For I know him, that be will command his Children, and his Houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do Justice and Judgment, that the Lord may bring upon him that which he hath spoken of him.</HI> Josh. 24. 15. <HI>And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your Fathers ser∣ved that were on the other side of the Flood, or the gods of the</HI> Amorites, <HI>in whose Land ye dwell, but as for me and my House, we will serve the LORD.</HI> David, Psal. 101. 2, 3, 6, 7. <HI>I will behave my self wisely in a perfest way, O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes▪ I hate the work of them that turn aside, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not cleave to me. Mine eyes shall be upon the Faithful of the Land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. He that worketh deceit, shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth Lies shall not tarry in my sight.</HI></P>
<P>Do your utmost to breed and train up your Children and Servants for Christ and Heaven, and not for the Devil and Hell.</P>
<P>Shall God make Inquisition for the Blood of the Body when murdered, and will he not for the Blood of a Soul?</P>
<P>Suppose when the beloved Child is in the Cradle, or at the Mothers Breast, the Devil should come, and say to the Parent, Take this Child and train it up for me; teach it to be Proud, to Lie, Swear, Steal, Prophane Gods Day, to Mock at Holiness, let it have its Will,

and never Restrain or Correct it; do not put it in mind of God, or Catechise it while you live. Send this Child early to my Schools, to Ale∣houses, Taverns, Comedies, teach it to Card and Dice, and all Fleshly Delights, Sports and Re∣creations; this would seem dreadful to you: and you would say, <HI>Get thee behind me Satan.</HI></P>
<P>O then let every Father take the same care, as <HI>David</HI> did of his Son <HI>Solomon,</HI> and as <HI>Solomon</HI> did of his Son <HI>Rehoboam.</HI> See the Pious and Pa∣rental Charge of <HI>David,</HI> 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 21.9.

<P>But who can say of his Children, as one said of <HI>Austin</HI> to his Mother <HI>Monica,</HI> That it was im∣possible a Child of so many Prayers should Pe∣rish. Are your Children the Children of Prayers and Tears?</P>
<P><HI>Job</HI> was careful of his Children, who sent and sanctified them after their Feasting. The study and care of most Parents is to Enrich their Children, to leave them ample Portions and Estates, to make them Great and Honourable, and to provide Husbands and Wives for them▪ but to Sanctifie and Save their Souls is not their care.</P>
<P>Happy is that man, when leaving the world, can say to his Children, as old <HI>Jacob, I die, but the Lord will be with you.</HI> When God by Death removes your near and dear Relations, you are troubled that you were no serviceable to their Souls.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="039482_0125_101426B35B264D58"/>Again, To your Relative Piety, add your Alms, draw out your Souls to the hungry.

Oh how apt are we to miss the mark, to go down the stream, and over the hedge daily. Its no less a miracle to be kept from the sins of the world whilst we live in it, than for those three Worthies not to be burned when in the fiery Fur∣nance.

We among the Tents of the Uncircumcised are as in the infected Pest-house, we cannot live not breath, but must suck in this Pestilential Air. <HI>Egypt</HI> was not fuller of <HI>Frogs</HI> and <HI>Lice</HI> in every Cham∣ber, in every hole, than the world is of sins, snares, and temptations; for prevention whereof, furnish your selves with divine Precepts, and set before you the best Paterns of Piety: Methinks I hear the Lord Jesus from heaven, say to every Christian and Professor in the World, as <HI>Gideon</HI> to his Souldiers, <HI>Look on me, and do likewise,</HI> Judg 17 Go in Christs steps, and you shall certainly partake of his grace, and glory, <HI>John</HI> 13.15.</P>

<P>THe fifth <HI>Ʋse</HI> is of Comfort, to those who are prepared to go in with Christ.</P>
<P>Christian, why weepest thou? Why is thine Heart grieved? Why is thy Countenance sad? Thou art to go in with Christ, <HI>where is fulness of Joy, and Pleasures for evermore.</HI> Say, <HI>Why art thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st down, O my Soul? Go thy way, eat thy Bread, and drink thy Wine with a merry Heart,</HI> Col. 9.7. Psal. 42.5.</P>
<P>Here are four great grounds of Comfort: If We consider,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What you shall go in from, and leave be∣hind.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Who you shall go in with.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. What you shall go into.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The Duration and Perpetuity of it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>First, In general, You shall go in from, and leave behind every thing that is afflictive and grievous to you. When <HI>Elijah</HI> went to Heaven,
<PB N="131" REF="039482_0133_1018807BA7F71828"/>
he left his Mantle behind him. So when Chri∣stians go in with Christ, they shall be perfectly and perpetually exempted from all Sinful and Penal Evils, both of Soul and Body.</P>
<P>Secondly, In particular,</P>
<P N="1">1. You shall be freed from all the Defector Deformities, and Superfluities of the Body. There will be no Dim or Sore Eyes, no Feeble Knees, Trembling Hands, Bald Heads, Crooked Backs, Broken Bones; no Wens, Warts, Wounds, Can∣cers, Fistulaes, Scars, or any Bodily Blemish.</P>
<P N="2">2. You shall be Perfectly, and for ever free from all your Bodily Toil, Pain, Labour, with which the Lives of many of Gods People have been made bitter. Some to get a little bread have been labouring in the very Fire, others grind∣ing at the Mill, some digging in the Mines, others casting up of Ditches, some spinning at the Tourn, others weaving at the Loom, &amp; thresh∣ing in the Barn, and carrying heavy Burdens, and many of them have been Servants to cruel hard Masters, like <HI>Israel</HI> under their Task-Masters: This will be the Jubilee and Year of the Lords Release.</P>
<P N="3">3. You shall be freed from all your anxious, vexing and tormenting Cares and Perplexities, about your carnal and bad Relations, as Hus∣bands, Wives, parents, Children, Friends, Estates, Law-Suits, Debts, Ill-neighbours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. You shall be freed from all your Sighs, Complaints, Groans, Rising from within or from without. <HI>Abraham</HI> shall no more complain for the want of an Heir, nor <HI>Rachel</HI> of her Barren∣ness, nor <HI>Rebecca</HI> of the Daughters of <HI>Heth,</HI> nor <HI>Jacob</HI> of his lost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ <HI>David</HI> shall not complain
<PB N="132" REF="039482_0134_1018807E077A3AF8"/>
of his treacherous familiar Friend, nor of his rebellious Son <HI>Absalom,</HI> or of being in the Tents of <HI>Kedar,</HI> the Song of the Drunkard, There shall be no grieving Thorn, or pricking Briar, or a <HI>Canaanite</HI> in the House of the Lord, neither shall they be sensible of Hunger, or Cold, or Naked∣ness, any more for ever.</P>
<P N="5">5. You shall be freed from all your Weaknesses, Sicknesses, and all Diseases whatsoever. There shall be no more Ague, Fever, Gout, Stone, Stran∣gury, Spleen, Scurvy, Consumption, Dropsies and Lethargies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The cause of all this will be removed. There will be neither an Aking-head nor Sinful Heart.</P>
<P N="6">6. You shall be freed from all your Pain and Travel, through Cold, Dirt, Winds, Storms, and other Difficulties, to come at the Word and Or∣dinances of God, and from all your Deadness and Weariness in Duties, which is the grief and sor∣row of your Souls.</P>
<P N="7">7. You shall be perfectly freed from all your Fears, Corruptions, Temptations, Desertions and Doubts, about your Souls and Heaven. The Spouse will never say, Her Beloved is withdrawn and gone from her. <HI>Job</HI> shall never feel the poisoned Arrows within him more. <HI>David</HI> will never say, <HI>Save me, O Lord, for the Waters are come in upon my Soul: mine Eyes fail, while I wait for my God.</HI> The Believer shall never be heard to say or wish, Oh! That I knew the work of Grace in me were true and saving, that God's Heart were towards me, and that my Heart were truly set on God. Then all their Desires shall be satisfied, all their Fears removed, all their Doubts resolved, all their Prayers fully answered,
<PB N="133" REF="039482_0135_10188080630CBB88"/>
and all their Graces perfected: and each Saint shall come to the fulness of the Stature of the Gift of Christ. When <HI>Moses</HI> was in the Mount, he came shining down. Surely, the prepared Christian shall go shining in, when clad with the Robe of Christs Glorious Righteousness. The Bodies and Souls of Believers shall be as <HI>Adam,</HI> when the Crown of Original Righteousness was set upon his head: The Body will be in its per∣fect strength, and (as some think) as it was be∣tween Thirty and Forty Years; and the Colours so rare, fresh, bright and transparent, that all the veins and nerves will be discerned, and so full of strength and agility, as it shall be able (saith <HI>Luther</HI>) to Toss the greatest Mountain as a Ball. The Apostle speaking of the Glory of the Bodies of the Saints at the Resurrection, saith, <HI>It is sown in Corruption, it is raised in Incorruption; it is sown in Dishonour, it is raised in Glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in Power,</HI> 1 Cor. 15.42, 43. The same Apostle affirmeth, <HI>That their vile Bo∣dies shall be made like unto Christs Glorious Body.</HI> Then shall each Saint shine brighter than the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father, for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT is very comfortable to reflect upon the Persons that shall be Copartners with you of this Glory, who shall go in with Christ to the Marriage. We read, <HI>Psal.</HI> 45. of the Queen in Gold of <HI>Ophir,</HI> the Kings Daughters, and honou∣rable Women, the Virgins thy Companions, which with gladness and rejoycing shall be bro't, they shall enter the Kings Palace. That numberless
<PB N="134" REF="039482_0136_10188082CB96DF88"/>
number of Sealed Ones, <HI>Rev.</HI> 7 9. &amp; great Assembly, at First-born, which are written in Heaven, many of which you have known, shall go in with you. Those that have gone to the House of God with you, Fasted, Mourned, Prayed with you, those that have Suffered with you, and who have heard the Word, and received the Lords Supper with you, and all that have Died in the Lord, and gone to Heaven before you.</P>
<P>All the Holy Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, Ministers, (<HI>viz.</HI>) your Godly Pastors, Godly Parents, Godly Husbands, Godly Wives, Godly Children, Godly Servants, Godly Neigh∣bours, whom ye have not seen many Years, shall go in with you.</P>
<P>Is not this comfortable? Christian, thou shalt see <HI>Adam</HI> the first man, that God made, and <HI>Abel</HI> the first Martyr, <HI>Enoch</HI> that walked with God, and was Translated: Thou shalt see <HI>Noah</HI> that was in the Ark, and saved from the Flood, and <HI>Lot</HI> who lived in <HI>Sodom,</HI> whose righteous Soul was vexed with their Uncleanness. Thou shalt have the sight of <HI>Abraham,</HI> who offered up his Son, and <HI>Joseph</HI> who was sold into <HI>Egypt</HI>: Thou shalt see <HI>Jacob</HI> who wrestled with the Angel, and got the blessing. Thou shalt see <HI>Moses</HI> the great Pro∣phet that was in the Mount, and brought down the Law to the People, and <HI>Aaron</HI> the High Priest, and <HI>Joshua</HI> who went with the People into <HI>Ca∣naan,</HI> and <HI>Samuel</HI> who Ministred to the Lord when he was but a Child: Thou shalt see <HI>Sampson</HI> who pulled down the House upon the <HI>Philistines,</HI> and <HI>David</HI> the man after Gods own Heart, who slew <HI>Goliah</HI>; and <HI>Solomon</HI> that built the Temple, and the rest of the Godly Kings of <HI>Judah</HI>: Thou shalt
<PB N="135" REF="039482_0137_101880851A4E4890"/>
also see the Three Children that were cast into the fiery Furnace, and <HI>Daniel</HI> that was cast into the Den of Lions. Thou shalt see <HI>John the Bap∣tist,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at was the fore-runner of Christ, and <HI>Paul</HI> that was beheaded for Christ, and <HI>Peter</HI> that was Crucified for Christ, and the good Women that ministred to him, and stood by him in his Suffer∣ings, and <HI>Joseph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea,</HI> who begged his sacred Body, and put it in his Sepulchre. Thou shalt see the Blessed Virgin in whose Womb he was conceived; Thou shalt see <HI>Cranmer, Ridley, Latimer,</HI> and many faithful Ministers and Christi∣ans, who were Burned and Died for the Truth in the <HI>Marian</HI> Days. Here is a blessed time indeed, to go in with all those, and who can tell how many more, who shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the Air, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4.</P>
<P N="3">3. WHat they shall go into, is unspeakable Joy to reflect upon.</P>
<P>To the Publick Consummation of the Mar∣ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is to be between the Kings Son and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Daughter, Christ and the Church, <HI>Rev.</HI> 19. What a comfort will this be to the Daughters of <HI>Zion</HI> to behold King <HI>Solomon, i. e.</HI> Christ, in the day of his Espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart. Here we see but at a distance, and thro' a Glass darkly, then face to face; we shall see him as he is, and behold his Glory, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.9, 10, 11, 12. 1. <HI>John</HI> 3.2. <HI>Joh</HI> 17.24. The Queen of <HI>Sheba,</HI> took a great Journey to behold the Glory of <HI>Solomon,</HI> which did transport her with wonder, what will the sight of Christs Person and Glory do?</P>
<P>Secondly, They shall be openly Owned and Ac∣knowledged by Christ, when he is exalted above all.
<PB N="136" REF="039482_0138_101880876E77FF00"/>
For a King to manifest signal Respect to some of his Subjects and Favourites on his Marriage or Corona∣tion-day, is an high Honour.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They shall be Enthroned and Crowned with Christ, yea, sit down with him in his Throne, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.21. And if there were such Shouts, Joy, Sing∣ing and Triumphs, when <HI>Solomon</HI> was on the Throne, that the very Earth did rent with the sound of them, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 1.39, 40. O what will there be when the Saints shall be on the Throne-Royal, to Judge the world! And if there is joy among the Angels at the Conversion of one Sinner, what Acclamations and Triumphs will be among the Angels at the Co∣ronation of so many Saints. There was great Joy when <HI>Joseph</HI> and his Brethren met in <HI>Pharaohs</HI> Court, what Joy will there be when JESUS and Believers shall meet above the Clouds, and in their Fathers House!</P>
<P>Fourthly, They shall go into the very Presence of God, and have the full Vision of him, to see his E∣ternal Records, Counsels and Decrees that have been concealed so long. Then it will appear what they shall be. Believers▪ Christ Spouse will never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lly understand her Dignity and Greatness till sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome to God.</P>
<P><HI>Candala</HI> Queen of <HI>Fanema</HI> sometime said to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> for her Royal Entertainment, <HI>That she never knew her self to be a Queen, till she came to their Terri∣tories.</HI> The same may Saints say, when they come to the upper Regions and Mansions of Glory.</P>
<P>LAstly, 'tis strong Consolation to consider the Duration of the Joys and Happiness of the Saints in Heaven, which will be without any Inter∣mission, Succession, or Conclusion. To go into the New <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> that needeth no Light of the Sun,
<PB N="137" REF="039482_0139_101880891A16DD10"/>
Moon nor Stars, and to be with God, Christ, Angels and Saints for ever, will be incomparable Joy, St. <HI>Paul</HI> affirmeth, <HI>That Believers shall be ever with the Lord,</HI> 1 Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> 4.17, 18. 'Tis said of that Holy Man Mr. <HI>Ward,</HI> That being in the midst of a Dinner, and the People wondering what he was musing about, he pre∣sently brake out, <HI>For ever, for ever, for ever,</HI> for almost a Quarter of an Hour he could not be still'd, but Cried out, <HI>For ever, for ever, for ever.</HI></P>
<P>TO Conclude, Christian speedily get an Assu∣rance of Faith, that thou mayst come to a Victorious Conclusion against the strength of Doubts, whereby thy pure mind may be ascertained, per∣swaded, and upon good ground settled in the belief of going in with Christ.</P>
<P>I shall shut up all in a few Queries.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Q. Sinner, Canst thou believe that those only who are Prepared, shall be for ever with Christ, and not one more?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Q Hast thou done as God Commanded</HI> Hezeki∣ah <HI>at his Summons for Death? Set thy House in Or∣der, disposed of thine Estate, and laid no Foundation for thy Wife, children, Friends, Relations, to quarrel when thou art Dead, and laid in thy Grave?</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Q. Shalt thou leave a good Savour behind thee when ever thou goest hence? And is there any just cause of any</HI> Shimei <HI>to Curse, or Dog to Bark at thee</HI>?</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>Q. Darest thou own all that thou hast gotten be∣fore the Great &amp; Dreadful Judge, and say as</HI> Samuel, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.3, 5. Whose Ox have I taken? Whose Ass have I taken? Or whom have I Defrauded? And he said, the Lord is witness that you have
<PB N="138" REF="039482_0140_1018808B9A780040"/>
not found ought in my Hand. <HI>Is there no Man, Orphan, or Widow wronged, or Debts contracted, and not Paid?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Q Hast thou carried thy self like a Christian in thy Calling, Office and Relation, and Entail'd a Blessing upon thy Estate and Family? Where is the Man or Womans Child or Servant, that can rise up and call thee Blessed, or Cordially Bless God for thy Example, Company, Counsel?</HI></P>
<P N="6">6 <HI>Q What hast thou done for the Church of Christ, his Honour, Interest, Ministers and afflicted Members? Have they been the better for thee or thine Estate? Great Receipts will have a great Account.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>If the Cry at Midnight should now sound in thine Ears, art thou ready for the Marriage</HI>?</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Bolton</HI> Dying told his Children, <HI>That none of them should dare to meet him at Gods Tribunal in an Ʋnregenerate Estate</HI>: The Reason is in the Text. Oh! Let it never, never be forgotten, That <HI>those that were Ready went in with him to the Marriage, and the Door was Shut.</HI></P>
