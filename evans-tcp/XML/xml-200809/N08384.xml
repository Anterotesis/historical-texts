<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE valuable writings of that pious christian, <HI>William Penn,</HI> of which I am a great admirer, as they appear to be written from the heart, with a view to promote the happiness of mankind in general; I therefore sincerely wish they were more gene∣rally read and attended to than I believe they are.— But being sensible that many are deprived of the advan∣tage of his writings, from their inability to purchase them (being comprised in two large and expensive volumes)—I have thought it my duty to get this short Extract printed, (containing a very interesting Summons, &amp;c. to the World) in a small pamphlet, for the benefit of such who are not able to purchase his works, as well as the Public in general; to whom I beg leave to recommend it as what is of infinite concern to them.— I subscribe myself a well-wisher to the happiness of mankind in general.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>SUMMONS,</HI> or <HI>CALL</HI> to <HI>CHRISTENDOM:</HI> In an earnest Expostulation with Her, to prepare for the Great and Notable <HI>Day</HI> of the <HI>Lord</HI> that is at the Door.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>WAKE, O <HI>Christendom!</HI> awake, and come to judgment, for the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>notable day</HI> of the <HI>Lord</HI> is drawing apace upon thee; prepare to meet him, thou and thy children, for the hour of his <HI>judgment</HI> hasteneth upon you, as tra∣vail on a woman with child, in which all your works shall be tried, and that by <HI>fire,</HI> for <HI>the day of the</HI> Lord, <HI>shall burn as an oven, end all the proud, and all that do wickedly shall be as stubble.</HI> Yea, <HI>by fire and by sword will the Lord God Almighty plead with all flesh;</HI> with all fleshly worshippers and workers, who live after the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof: And with the <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>judgment,</HI> and the <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>burning,</HI> that is, with spiritual <HI>judgment</HI> and <HI>burning,</HI> will he visit all ranks and regions upon the earth: Yea, his holy <HI>terrors</HI> shall take hold of the <HI>rebellious,</HI> and an∣guish and distress shall fill the souls of the guilty. The faces of nations shall gather paleness, and their knees smite together, because of the anger of <HI>God,</HI> that is kindling against them, and his fierce wrath, that is revealing from heaven against all the ungodly, but more especially against the children of the <HI>mystery</HI> of <HI>iniquity:</HI> 'Tis in this day that the kindreds of the earth shall mourn with a great lamentation.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="010723_0003_0F817627243CE2D0"/>O <HI>Christendom!</HI> thou hast long sat as a <HI>Queen,</HI> that should never know sorrow; <HI>great have been thy pretences, and large thy profession of God, Christ, spirit</HI> and <HI>scriptures;</HI> come, let me expostulate with <HI>thee,</HI> and thy <HI>children,</HI> in the fear and presence of him, that shall bring every <HI>word</HI> and <HI>work</HI> to judgment, <HI>God is pure,</HI> and <HI>the pure in heart only see him:</HI> Now, are ye pure? Do you see him? <HI>God</HI> is a <HI>spirit,</HI> and none can worship him aright, but such as come to his <HI>spirit,</HI> and obey it: Do you so? <HI>Christ is the gift of God,</HI> have you received him into your hearts? Does he rule there? Then have you eternal life abiding in you: If not, you are not <HI>true Christians.</HI> The <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>truth</HI> leadeth into all <HI>truth;</HI> and the <HI>children of God</HI> are born of it, and led by it. But are you led into all the holy <HI>ways</HI> of <HI>truth,</HI> born of this eternal spirit? Then you follow not the <HI>spirit</HI> of this <HI>world;</HI> nor do your own wills, but the <HI>will</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> You profess the holy <HI>scriptures;</HI> but what do you witness and experience? What interest have you in them? Can you set to your seal they are true, by the <HI>work</HI> of the same <HI>spirit</HI> in you, that gave them forth in the holy <HI>ancients?</HI> What's <HI>David's roarings</HI> and <HI>praises</HI> to thee, that livest in the lusts of this world? What's <HI>Paul's and Peter's</HI> experiences to thee, that walkest after the flesh?</P>
<P>O you, that are called <HI>Christians,</HI> give ear a little unto me, for I am prest in spirit to write to you: Read with patience, and consider my words; for behold, what I have to say to you concerneth your eternal good.</P>
<P><HI>GOD hath so loved the world,</HI> that he hath sent his only begotten <HI>Son</HI> into the world, that those that believe on him, should have eternal life. And this son is <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> the true <HI>light,</HI> that lighteth every one coming into the <HI>world;</HI> and they that abide not
<PB N="5" REF="010723_0003_0F817627243CE2D0"/>
in him the <HI>light,</HI> dwell in <HI>darkness,</HI> in <HI>sin,</HI> and are under the region and shadow of death: Yea <HI>dead</HI> in <HI>sin,</HI> and see not their own states, neither perceive the sad conditions of their own souls. They are blind to the things of God's kingdom, and unsensible of true and spiritual <HI>life,</HI> and <HI>motion,</HI> what it is to live to God: And in that state, are alienated from God, without true judgment and living knowledge; and under the curse. For in Jesus Christ, the <HI>light</HI> of the <HI>world,</HI> are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, redemption and glory; they are hid from the <HI>worldly christian,</HI> from all that are captivated by the spirit and lusts of the world: And whoever would see them, (for therein consist the things, that belong to their eternal peace) must come to Christ Jesus the true <HI>light</HI> in their consciences, bring their deeds to him, love him and obey him; whom God hath ordained a <HI>light to lighten the Gentiles, and for his Sal∣vation to the ends of the earth. Light and salvation</HI> are joined together, and none can come to salvation, but as they come first to the light, and submit to the manifestation of it, which leadeth to salvation. For <HI>the nations of them that are saved, shall walk in the light of the lamb,</HI> Christ Jesus. <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>justifi∣cation</HI> are also joined together: <HI>If we walk in the light, as God is in the light, the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin.</HI> And <HI>light</HI> and <HI>life eternal</HI> are joined together: <HI>For in the word</HI> (that was with God in the beginning, and was God, by whom <HI>all things</HI> were made, that were made) <HI>was life, and the life was the light of men.</HI> And this is the testimony of Jesus, <HI>I am the light of the world; he that followeth me, shall not abide in darkness, but have the light of life;</HI> yea, it is <HI>eternal life,</HI> to believe in him, in Christ the <HI>light,</HI> to receive, embrace, and to follow him. And <HI>that was the true light</HI> (saith the same beloved
<PB N="6" REF="010723_0004_0F81762776446CF0"/>
disciple) <HI>which lighteth every man, that cometh into the world.</HI> Now this <HI>light</HI> shineth in <HI>darkness,</HI> in the children of darkness, in their dark hearts, in their black souls, and defiled consciences, but in this <HI>dark∣ness</HI> they comprehend it not. Neither can man know the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>benefit</HI> of it, while he rebelleth against it; for the virtue and excellency of it is shut up and hid from the <HI>children</HI> of <HI>disobedience.</HI> To as many as received him of old, gave he power to become the <HI>children</HI> of <HI>God;</HI> and they that did his will, knew his doctrine to be of God, and of power and efficacy to their salvation.</P>
<P>But this is the great <HI>condemnation</HI> of the <HI>world</HI> at this day, that though <HI>God</HI> hath sent his <HI>son</HI> a <HI>light</HI> into the hearts of all men and women, to manifest and reprove their evil deeds, and to save them; yet they love <HI>darkness,</HI> they love the lusts and imagina∣tions of their vain hearts, better than this holy <HI>light,</HI> that is given unto them for <HI>salvation:</HI> They chuse <HI>Barabbas</HI> rather than <HI>Jesus.</HI> Yea they have set up other <HI>lights,</HI> than Christ Jesus, <HI>God's</HI> great <HI>light;</HI> and other <HI>prophets</HI> than <HI>Christ,</HI> God's great <HI>prophet;</HI> and other <HI>priests</HI> than <HI>Jesus,</HI> the <HI>High-Priest</HI> of the new covenant: But they are <HI>dark lights, false prophets,</HI> and <HI>blind priests. All that came before me,</HI> saith Christ, <HI>are thieves and robbers:</HI> And all that pray, preach, sing, worship, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and not by the <HI>light</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> of Jesus, they go before Christ, before Christ cometh, before he prepareth their hearts, and toucheth their lips with a coal, from his heavenly altar; and perform worship in their own will, time and power, and stay not for his leadings. And therefore all such rob <HI>Christ</HI> of his <HI>office,</HI> who is the <HI>leader</HI> of the true <HI>christians,</HI> their heavenly <HI>High-Priest,</HI> to anoint them, and offer up their sacrifice to God for them; and <HI>prophet,</HI> to let them see and know by his <HI>light,</HI> in
<PB N="7" REF="010723_0004_0F81762776446CF0"/>
their hearts, what they ought to do according to the new and everlasting covenant; <HI>I will write my law in their hearts, and put my spirit in their inward parts, and they shall be all taught of me, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Now this is the question to the whole world called Christians: <HI>Do you see with this divine light? Have you searched your hearts with it? And are you anointed by this High-Priest with his holy unction, that leadeth into all truth? Doth this heavenly prophet give you vision, and reveal the father to you? Is he your eye, your head, your wisdom? Do you live, move, and have your life and being in him, in praying, preaching, and singing,</HI> yea, <HI>in your whole conversation? Are you re∣newed into his life and image? And have you heard his voice, and seen his shape? Are you witnesses of his holy rebukes, his pure judgments, the shame and death of his cross? Is he the fountain of your knowledge? The author of your faith?</HI> O consider! <HI>Are you of those, that have spoke with Jesus? That have been taught in the school of his holy cross? Students in his heavenly academy? O have you drank of his cup, and been baptized with his baptism?</HI> Tell me in the fear of the Lord God, you that call yourselves <HI>Christians,</HI> doth he go before you, and lead you as a master teacheth his <HI>disciples,</HI> and a <HI>Captain</HI> leadeth his <HI>soldiers?</HI> And do you follow him in all the weighty things of this life? And doth he order your minds, and rule your affections? If not, you are <HI>thieves</HI> and <HI>robbers;</HI> for you rob <HI>Christ</HI> of his <HI>office.</HI> For God hath appointed him to be the <HI>leader</HI> and <HI>ruler</HI> of all people; yea, 'tis God's decree; and those that he leadeth not in their thoughts, words, and works, shall never come to God: For all must come to God by him, that is, by his <HI>light,</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> ruling in their hearts, which sanctifieth, regenerateth, and converteth the soul to God.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="010723_0005_0F817628346E5D00"/>And the cause of the <HI>confusion</HI> and <HI>contention,</HI> that is about <HI>religion,</HI> in <HI>Europe;</HI> at this day, is, that men have <HI>deserted</HI> this true <HI>light</HI> and holy <HI>spirit,</HI> and so are degenerated from the life and power of pure and unspotted <HI>religion,</HI> and have attempted to compre∣hend Christ's doctrines without Christ's light, and to know the <HI>things</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> without the <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> And being thus miserably erred by wicked works from the <HI>one spirit</HI> of <HI>truth,</HI> they have wandered into the fallible <HI>conceits</HI> and <HI>opinions</HI> of <HI>men.</HI> And in this state one party hath contended against another: From <HI>words</HI> they have fallen to <HI>blows,</HI> and the strong∣est hath opprest the weakest. And not knowing what spirit they were of, have called <HI>light, darkness,</HI> and <HI>darkness, light;</HI> putting the <HI>sheep's-skin</HI> upon the <HI>wolf,</HI> and the <HI>wolf's-skin</HI> upon the poor <HI>sheep</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> endeavouring by <HI>carnal weapons</HI> to enforce their opi∣nions, and to extort <HI>conformity,</HI> by wordly <HI>laws</HI> and <HI>punishments,</HI> to their persuasions. All this is out of the light, life and doctrine of Christ Jesus, and in the spirit of darkness, confusion, strife and blood∣shed, which are of the <HI>devil.</HI> All which <HI>Babel</HI> must and shall come down by the <HI>light, power,</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> of Jesus now rising in the world; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hell, death and the grave, shall not be able to hinder it: For the set time, the appointed time of the father is come, and the <HI>judgment</HI> is begun.</P>
<P>O ye, that are called <HI>Roman-Catholicks,</HI> tell me, are you truly <HI>catholick,</HI> that is, of an <HI>universal spirit?</HI> Then you will not <HI>persecute,</HI> but love all, and be tender to all. Are you truly <HI>Roman,</HI> and <HI>successors</HI> of that <HI>ancient apostolical church? Then you walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit,</HI> yea, the spirit of Christ dwelleth in you, and you are led by the <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and can call him <HI>father</HI> in truth and righteous∣ness, and the <HI>word</HI> of <HI>God</HI> in the heart is your teacher,
<PB N="9" REF="010723_0005_0F817628346E5D00"/>
and not the traditions of men; for so the <HI>Romans</HI> of old time were instructed. O consider, if you are true <HI>successors,</HI> you must follow them in the same nature, spirit and life; for in that only standeth the <HI>christian succession,</HI> to wit, in Christ: And every <HI>branch,</HI> person or church, that abideth not in this great <HI>vine,</HI> is rejected for the fire. Therefore deceive not yourselves, as the <HI>Jews</HI> of old did, with crying, <HI>the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord;</HI> and saying, <HI>we have</HI> Abraham <HI>to our father, and to us be∣long the fathers, covenants, law, priesthood, and chair of</HI> Moses: For as the apostle said of old, so say I to you; <HI>his servants you are, to whom you obey,</HI> and <HI>he that committeth sin is of the devil.</HI> So that <HI>Christ's suc∣cessors</HI> are they that take up his cross, follow him, and that abide in his holy doctrine, that keep his commandments, and themselves unspotted from the world. And those that follow the <HI>lust</HI> of the <HI>eye,</HI> the <HI>lust</HI> of the <HI>flesh,</HI> and <HI>pride</HI> of <HI>life,</HI> are not of Christ, nor of the father, but of the <HI>world;</HI> subjects to the prince of the power of the <HI>air,</HI> and successors of <HI>Sodom, Gomorrah, Egypt, Tyre, Sidon,</HI> and persecuting <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and not of the harmles., self-denying, holy, suffering <HI>spouse</HI> of <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> that is ruled in all things by her husband, her <HI>head</HI> her <HI>Lord.</HI> O search and try with the <HI>light</HI> of Jesus, if you are not degenerated from primitive simplicity, and purity? For great are the abominations of all <HI>sects,</HI> that flow like a deluge throughout your <HI>countries!</HI> Repent, and turn to the ancient <HI>apostolical spirit</HI> and <HI>life,</HI> that you may enter into the <HI>rest</HI> of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>O you that call yourselves <HI>evangelicks,</HI> or <HI>gospellers,</HI> are you <HI>evangelical?</HI> Are you saved from the <HI>lusts</HI> and <HI>pleasures,</HI> and dead worships of the world by the mighty <HI>power</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> which is the <HI>gospel,</HI> and led by an <HI>evangelical spirit?</HI> If not, you are not yet <HI>redeemed,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="010723_0006_0F817629025C0100"/>
you are not yet under <HI>grace,</HI> which is the <HI>gospel-state.</HI> For you are not taught by it, but <HI>rebel</HI> against it; how then are you true <HI>gospellers,</HI> men of <HI>gospel-liberty,</HI> men of deliverance and redemption; to whom im∣mortality is brought to light, (as it is to all, that truly know and receive the blessed <HI>gospel</HI>) that are yet subjects and servants to <HI>sin?</HI> How can you sing the <HI>song</HI> of the <HI>lamb,</HI> that are not delivered by the <HI>lamb;</HI> but by your vain conversations crucify the <HI>lamb,</HI> and do despite to the <HI>spirit</HI> of <HI>grace,</HI> and that every day? The true <HI>gospellers</HI> are those, that receive the <HI>angel's message,</HI> who is the great preacher of the everlasting <HI>gospel,</HI> viz. <HI>Fear God, give glory to his name, for the hour of his judgment is come; and no more worship the beast.</HI> Do you fear God in truth, and in sincerity? Then are you fearful of offending the <HI>Lord,</HI> and ten∣der of God's glory; then are your hearts kept clean, then are you wise to <HI>salvation;</HI> and so you can glorify God indeed: otherwise your prayers and praises are not <HI>evangelical</HI> in God's sight.</P>
<P>But tell me, O ye <HI>gospellers,</HI> is the <HI>hour</HI> of his <HI>judgment</HI> come to you? Is it begun at your houses yet? How do you feel it? Hath it broke your hearts? Hath it contrited your spirits? Have ye known the Godly sorrow? The chastisements of the Lord, and rebuke of the Almighty? Hath his pure eternal word <HI>divided</HI> yet betwixt your soul and spirit, the joints and marrow? Have you ever been <HI>weary</HI> and <HI>heavy laden</HI> with sin? Hath it been a burden to you? Did you ever cry out, in the agony of your spirits yet, <HI>men and brethren what shall we do to be saved?</HI> O! who shall deliver us from the <HI>body</HI> of <HI>sin</HI> here, and the wrath to come! (the travel of the holy ancients) if not, you are yet strangers to <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>kingdom:</HI> And if you die in that state, <HI>where he is gone, you shall never come.</HI> For <HI>Sion,</HI> God's city,
<PB N="11" REF="010723_0006_0F817629025C0100"/>
must be redeemed through judgments, and her con∣verts through righteousness: Yea the <HI>house of God</HI> cannot escape it; wherefore said one of old, if judg∣ment begin at the <HI>house of God, where shall the sinner and ungodly appear?</HI> O <HI>woe</HI> to them, that live without the <HI>judgments</HI> of the <HI>Lord! Woe</HI> to them, that cast his reproofs behind their backs, and live in earthly pleasures, fatting up themselves in their lusts and pleasures, as for the day of slaughter, and treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath. O the <HI>ancient Saints</HI> lived not thus; they wrought out their salva∣tion with <HI>fear and trembling;</HI> yea, they gave all dili∣gence, to make their calling and election sure: Which way do you work out yours? <HI>Habbakuk,</HI> that holy prophet, <HI>his lips quivered, and his belly trembled, that his soul might rest in the day of trouble:</HI> Is this your state? Or, are you not rather <HI>worshippers</HI> of the <HI>beast</HI> at this day, lovers of the worldly, sensual, voluptu∣ous life, walking in the lusts of the eye, the lusts of the flesh, and pride of life; like rebellious <HI>Israel</HI> of old, <HI>forgetting God, days without number?</HI> But this know, that <HI>all that forget God, shall be turned into hell.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! what is become of the fatherly <HI>visitation</HI> made to your progenitors, those good beginnings sown in <HI>persecutions</HI> and <HI>martyrdoms?</HI> Have you answered the loving-kindness of God therein? Have you advanced in the <HI>way</HI> of <HI>righteousness?</HI> Are you become an holy nation, and a peculiar people to God, zealous of good works? But have you not betaken yourselves to the wisdom and learning of this world, to make <HI>ministers,</HI> and deserted the <HI>spirit</HI> of the <HI>Lord,</HI> and fled to the power and policy of this world, to defend and pro∣tect you, and not to the <HI>name</HI> of the <HI>Lord,</HI> which hath always been the strong <HI>tower</HI> of the <HI>righteous?</HI> Nay, are you not divided one against another, and turned
<PB N="12" REF="010723_0007_0F817629C19482B0"/>
<HI>persecutors</HI> for <HI>religion,</HI> yourselves denying that <HI>liberty</HI> to others, you took for yourselves? Ah! where is the Royal law of <HI>doing as you would be done unto.</HI></P>
<P>Thus have you decayed and degenerated into a <HI>worldly clergy</HI> and a <HI>carnal people,</HI> holding and main∣taining reformed words, in an unreformed <HI>spirit,</HI> yea, are not the same evils, <HI>pride, passion, malice, wars, bloodshed, persecution, deceit, fleshly lusts, wanton∣ness, vain pleasure, and sports,</HI> yea, all manner of worldly-mindedness to be found in you, that were in the persecutors of your forefathers, and against which your most serious and best ancestors faithfully testified? So that the difference now is about words and sentences; and not about the life, nature and spirit of <HI>pure and undefiled religion:</HI> And men are to be known now by their denominations and subscrip∣tions to certain human creeds, man-made faiths and forms, and not by the spirit and image of Christ Jesus, by the nature of the true sheep, and by that holy unction, that was the bond of the heavenly fellow∣ship of the saints of old.</P>
<P>And you that are called <HI>reformed,</HI> with the rest of the subdivided <HI>sects,</HI> what better are you for your names? Are ye regenerated yet? Are you <HI>reformed</HI> from the lusts of the eye, the lusts of the flesh, and the pride of life; from the <HI>devil</HI> and all his works? Are you born of the incorruptible seed, that liveth and abideth for ever? And are you come out of the corruptible things, and doth Christ lead you? Is the government of your souls upon his shoulders? Tell me, is it the <HI>new birth,</HI> that which is born of God through many tribulations, the <HI>new man</HI> created in Christ Jesus, that calleth God <HI>father</HI> in your prayers, and that maketh mention of him in your preachings? Or is it the <HI>first birth of the earth, earthly,</HI> the old man, the corrupt and unregenerated nature, that which is
<PB N="13" REF="010723_0007_0F817629C19482B0"/>
born of the flesh, that is to say, of the seed of the evil one, the father of all the fleshly lusts, inventions, imaginations and traditions of men, that taketh plea∣sure in the vain and wicked sports and pleasures of this apostate world, that forget God, and turn his grace into wantonness; reproaching, nick-naming, and persecuting the children of regeneration, with scornful names and cruel punishments, calling God father as the <HI>Jews</HI> did; and crucifying <HI>Christ</HI> afresh by a vain conversation at the same time.</P>
<P>O you degenerated <HI>Christians</HI> of all sorts, yea, all the several <HI>sects</HI> in <HI>Christendom,</HI> that have deserted your first love, and degenerated from the light and power of <HI>primitive godliness,</HI> with the light of Christ Jesus in your hearts examine yourselves. <HI>God hath lighted your candle,</HI> search and try yourselves; see how it standeth with you as to your eternal condition, before you go hence, and be no more in this world. Con∣sider, are you in the true faith of Christ or no? For without true faith none can please God; and without pleasing <HI>him</HI> no man can be saved. The devils be∣lieve, yea, and tremble too; that is more than thou∣sands, called Christians, do, and so far they are short of the very devils. Have you <HI>faith?</HI> Lets try it in the name of God. <HI>What is it for faith? Doth it over∣come the world? Doth it live and depend upon God? Can it forsake country and kindred? Turn out</HI> Ishmael? <HI>Offer up</HI> Isaac? <HI>Live a pilgrim, a stranger in the world? Doth it work by that love, which can forsake all for Christ's name-sake? Doth it fight against the devil? Re∣sist his fiery darts? Overcome his assaults and tempta∣tions? And finally, purify the soul to God's use?</HI> Is this your faith, O you carnal, outside Christians? No such matter; for you live in the flesh, fulfilling the lusts thereof; and your care is, what you shall eat, drink, and put on, and how you shall get the mam∣mon,

friendship and glory of this world. Examine yourselves, and prepare, for the day of the Lord hasteneth upon you. And have a care, lest you partake of the plagues that God hath prepared for <HI>Babylon;</HI> she that calleth herself the <HI>lamb's bride,</HI> and is an harlot, committing fornication throughout all nations and sects, that is, those that by a <HI>lying spirit,</HI> have had their hearts seduced from God and his holy fear, yet in words professed to be his people; who call themselves <HI>Jews,</HI> but are not; <HI>Christians,</HI> and are not, but of the synagogue of Satan; being stran∣gers to the <HI>circumcision in spirit,</HI> and the <HI>baptism that is with fire, and with the Holy Ghost:</HI> With <HI>fire,</HI> to consume the fleshly nature; and with the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> to beget the heavenly nature in man. O the down∣fal of this great city, and the desolation of this false church thro' all the sects in <HI>Christendom,</HI> is come and coming! Yea, in one day shall it be accomplished, even in the day of the appearance of Christ, who is the <HI>second Adam,</HI> the Lord from Heaven, who by the brightness of his coming, and by the breath of his mouth in the hearts of nations, shall reveal, and de∣stroy this great Antichrist, this man of sin, <HI>in man,</HI> that fitteth in the place of God, yea, exalted above all that is called God, requiring conformity to all his inventions and injunctions upon pain of life, liberty and estate: Nor are any suffered to buy or sell in this great city, but such as will <HI>receive his mark.</HI></P>
<P>Woe to you all in the name of the Lord, that call God your father, and are not born of him; that name <HI>his name,</HI> and hate to be reformed: That call <HI>Jesus</HI> Lord, and not by the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> who take his pure name into your mouths, and depart not from iniquity. I say to you on God's behalf, as God said to the <HI>Jews</HI> os old; your prayers, your sacrifices, and your solemn assemblies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in an unconverted state,

are abomination to the Lord. No matter for your names, your pretences, your creeds, if you live with∣out <HI>God in the world;</HI> that is, without his holy awe in your hearts, without a divine sense of his presence in your souls, and know not that Godly sorrow, that worketh unfeigned repentance, the only way to eter∣nal life. Your worship God loatheth: A dog's neck, swines blood, yea to bless an idol, or kill a man, is altogether as acceptable with the Lord. O! God is wrath with the feigned worships, as well as common ungodliness of the world: Come to Christ's spirit, be led of it, and do not your own wills, but the will of Christ Jesus; and then you shall know the true wor∣ship. For the true ministry and worship of God stand not in the will, wisdom, or appointment of men, nor can they be performed by unregenerated men; but in the leadings of his eternal spirit, by whom all the faithful offer up themselves, an accept∣able sacrifice to God, not to live unto themselves, but to him that hath purchased them. 'Tis true, Christ Jesus died for the <HI>ungodly,</HI> but not that they should continue <HI>ungodly, but take up his daily cross and follow him. Christ</HI> (saith <HI>Peter) suffered for us, leaving us an example that we should follow his steps:</HI> As he was in this world, so we should be, not conformable to the rudiments, fashions, and customs of this world, that pass away; but transformed and renewed in our minds by the grace that he hath given us: Which <HI>grace bringeth salvation</HI> to all that obey it, <HI>teaching</HI> such to deny all <HI>ungodliness and worldly lusts,</HI> and to <HI>live soberly, righteously, and Godly in this present</HI> evil <HI>world:</HI> Be∣cause <HI>without holiness, none shall</HI> ever <HI>see the Lord:</HI> That is God's decree.</P>
<P>Wherefore be you not deceived, O you formal and titular Christians; <HI>God will not be mocked: Such as you sow, such shall you reap at the hand of the Lord; yea,

for every idle word shall you give account in the day of judgment.</HI> Think not with yourselves, you have Christ to your Saviour, and your are reconciled to God, through <HI>Christ,</HI> and that God looketh not upon you, as you are in yourselves, but as in <HI>Christ;</HI> whilst you walk not after the <HI>spirit,</HI> but after the <HI>flesh:</HI> For the <HI>wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord:</HI> To whom? Not to them that despise <HI>his light</HI> in their hearts, that grieve <HI>his spirit,</HI> and by a worldly conversation go on to crucify him; and who follow not Jesus in the way of tribulation and regeneration. <HI>God is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity;</HI> and he looketh upon men and women to be, what they really are, and not what they imagine themselves to be: Behold he cometh, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his reward is with him, and he will reward all according to their works. <HI>Sinners, while such, can no more come into Christ, than into God; for God is in Christ, and Christ is in God: Christ is holy, harmless, pure, and undefiled, and separate from sinners.</HI> And if ever you would have God look upon you to be in Christ, you must come into Christ: And you can never come into Christ, the new and heavenly man, that is undefiled and seperated from sinners, <HI>till you come out of sin, and the author of it, the</HI> Devil, <HI>the old man of sin, and leave your wicked deeds of darkness.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore be ye seperate from every evil way: Christ, the <HI>immaculate lamb of God,</HI> came not only to save men from wrath, but from sin, which is the cause of wrath. <HI>Behold the lamb of God,</HI> saith John, <HI>which taketh away the sin of the world:</HI> Not their sin that will not believe in him, but the sins of those <HI>that are weary and heavy laden, that wait, hunger, thirst, and cry for his salvation; whom God hath given for a light to lighten the Gentiles, and for his salvation to the ends of the earth.</HI> O you that are called by his sacred

How doth the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life reign in your ter∣ritories? Are not your courts the very schools of vanity, and nurseries of worldly lusts and pleasures, which war against the soul, and lead to eternal des∣truction? O! you have much to answer for before the <HI>great God,</HI> at the day of his terrible tribunal, who have power in your hands to chase away wickedness, and to reform the world. It is written, <HI>a King upon his throne of judgment, scattereth all evil with his eye:</HI> O! that the Kings and Princes of the world knew this throne of true judgment!

Repent, and be just, for God the just God, the great Judge of heaven and earth, shall judge you all ac∣cording to your works: And dreadful shall that day of his reckoning and tribunal be, to all the workers of iniquity: <HI>But especially to unjust and corrupt Judges.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Woe</HI> to you farmers and countrymen, that reward the Lord evil for good, who giveth you increase of all things in their proper seasons, yet you discern not his hand, you regard not his care; you live <HI>without God in the world:</HI> Yet no life is fuller of the <HI>Lord's providence,</HI> who preserveth and prospereth your flocks, who increaseth your wine, your corn, and your grass; instead of remembering his goodness with reverence, and in your harvests praising him with fear, you sa∣crifice to your lusts, and rejoice only in your fulness; making merry at your harvests, without the fear of

Who speak peace to the wicked, and sow pillows under their elbows for reward: Pleasers of men, more than pleasers of God, <HI>Woe</HI> to you in the name of the Lord, that <HI>counterfeit his commission,</HI> and deceive the people, requiring th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> money for that which is not bread, and their labo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for that which doth not profit: At your doors lye<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the blood of souls, in which you have traded. <HI>O you physicians of no value,</HI> whom have you cured?

<P>O! I cannot but cry aloud to you all, of all ranks and qualities, from the highest to the lowest, that walk not after the spirit, but after the flesh, daily fulfilling the lusts thereof; that you would repent, and be saved. O how hath <HI>Christ's religion</HI> been pro∣phaned, and his holy name blasphemed by the lewd life of profest Christians!

wickedly destroyed one another. O the rapes, fires, mur∣ders, and rivers of blood, that lye at the doors of pro∣fest Christians!

O blasphemy! What need is there of any other demonstration, that <HI>Christendom</HI> is foully apostatized from the doctrine and example of <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> and his true followers, who saith, <HI>if ye love me, keep my commandments. By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</HI> And <HI>John</HI> saith, <HI>whosoever doth not love his brother, is not of God,</HI> and <HI>whosoever hateth his brother, is a murderer; and ye know, that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</HI> And it is not to be supposed, that they kill one another in love: For murder is not the effect of love and brotherly kindness, but of malice, envy and revenge. <HI>O Christendom!</HI> how art thou and thy children degenerated from God, and fallen from the doctrine of Christ, whose holy name thou professest Thou art become a city full of uncleanness, com¦mitting whoredom under every green tree; following other lovers than JESUS, whose spouse thou professest to be.

<P>O how expert have you been in these impieties! How ingenious to work wickedness, and how fruit∣ful in your inventions to gratify the lust of the eye, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life!

him: What did the Heathens, that Christians have not done? Yea, the same lusts, vanities, and impieties, that reigned among them, are to be found improved among Christians. So that 'tis <HI>Paganism made free of the Christian profession,</HI> or <HI>Heathanism christianed: And not to conform to the Heathen in the Christian, is not to be a Christian but an Heathen.</HI> O the ignorance as well as wickedness of the present Christian world! Verily, the Christian life is oppressed under this mass of darkness and impiety, found in the conversations of <HI>Apostate-Christians,</HI> even as Christ was grieved and burdened with the darkness and ob∣stinacy of the <HI>Apostate-Jews.</HI> And as the hard-heart∣edness of the <HI>false Jews</HI> crucified him <HI>outwardly,</HI> so hath the hard-heartedness of the <HI>false Christians</HI> cruci∣fied him <HI>inwardly:</HI> Which hath fulfilled what is re∣corded in the <HI>Apocalypse,</HI> viz. <HI>that the Lord was cru∣cified in</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Egypt, <HI>spiritually so called: For the false Christians are the spiritual</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Egypt, <HI>who <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve and live in</HI> Sodom's <HI>sins, and</HI> Egypt's <HI>lusts and plea∣sures.</HI> Yea, they are of the race of them that stoned the Prophets, and crucified the Lord of glory: Of the same nature and spirit.

That which they have grieved, shall grieve them; and that which they have bruised and resisted, shall reject and torment them; yea, it shall be a never-dying worm, and an endless pain to them.

<P>O that you might escape this great damnation! And I testifie to you in the word of the Lord, that God giveth unto you all a day of visitation, in which you may escape the wrath to come. For this end, God hath sent his Son a light into your hearts; 'tis he, which manifesteth all your thoughts, words and deeds unto you; 'tis he, which checks and reproveth you; yea, 'tis he, which expostulateth and striveth with you; 'tis he, that knocketh at your doors, and awakeneth you to judgment: Who condemneth every unfruit<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <HI>thought, word</HI> and <HI>work</HI> in you.

And though his word be as fire in your hearts, and though you are even <HI>scorched</HI> within you, because of the heat thereof yet bear the indignation of the Lord, in that you have sinned against him. Wait, watch, and walk in the light of the Lord Jesus, that in his blood you may feel re∣mission of sins, and sanctification unto life eternal: That you may no more walk after the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof, but in the spirit of holiness; that you may be sealed unto the day of redemption.

and worship is most remote from it. Flesh and blood have no share in his worship; the will and runnings of man have no part in his way. 'Tis neither at the mountain, where one sort runneth; nor at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> whither another sort goeth; but in spirit, within the vail, hid from flesh and blood: Yea, there it is, that his worship is known and performed.

What's the matter? The way is narrow for flesh and blood; there is a cross must be taken up, a bitter cup drunk, and a baptism, yea, of blood gone through. Man must die to his own will, affections, imaginations, and carnal conceptions; he must wait and watch; yea, continually: His own religion and righteousness is as odious as his sin and iniquity, yea, in a sense more dangerous.
