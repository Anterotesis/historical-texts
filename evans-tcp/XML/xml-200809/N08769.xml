<Q><BIBL>2 PETER I.12, 13.14.</BIBL>
<P>"Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things; though ye know them, and be established in the present truth: Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me."</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DEATH is the common lot of all a men. Whether we sustain a public, or private character in life, we shall, in a little time, go the way whence we shall not return. And the thought, that we must certainly and short∣ly
<PB N="6" REF="011207_0004_0F862C72F1C0F810"/>
leave this present world, is powerfully adapt∣ed to awaken our powers, and excite us to dili∣gence in doing the work that is respectively as∣signed us, in the providence of God. Said our blessed Saviour, while on earth, "I must work the work of him that sent me." And why? the reason follows in the next words, "for the night cometh, wherein no man can work." To the like purpose, it was the resolution of the apostle Peter, in my text, to be ever diligent in his duty, as a minister of our Lord Jesus Christ; and upon this motive, "knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle."</P>
<P>HE spake these words with a more imme∣diate referrence to himself: But they are equal∣ly applicable to all, whom it has pleased God to entrust with the ministry of the gospel of his Son Jesus Christ. And in this accommodated view, the two following things are observable in them.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE duty of gospel ministers, intimated in those words, "I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things."</P>
<P N="2">II. THE motive by which this duty is en∣forced; "knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me."</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, these are the particulars to employ your thoughts, and then to be applied to the present occasion.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="011207_0005_0F862C73B2699420"/>I. THE first thing observable in the text is, the duty of gospel ministers; suggested in those words, "I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things; though ye know them, and be established in the present truth: Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance."</P>
<P>THE persons, to whom the apostle Peter was now writing, had, for a considerable time, made a profession of the christian faith; for which reason, he was rather concerned to refresh their minds with a "remembrance of the things which they knew already," than to tickle their ears with new notions which they had never heard of before. Accordingly, having ex∣horted them, in the foregoing part of this chap∣ter, not to rest satisfied with their having "faith" in the gospel revelation, but to "give diligence to add to their faith, virtue, and knowledge, and temperance, and patience and godliness, and brotherly kindness, and charity," and to "abound" in these graces; assuring them "that so entrance should be ministred to them abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ:" I say, having thus exhor∣ted them, he resolves in the words of the text now under consideration, to repeat his exhor∣tations "to these things;" and to go on so doing "as long as he lived," not allowing him self to be ever "negligent" to put them in mind∣of such important points, in the business of their salvation. Not that he hereby intended to sug∣gest,
<PB N="8" REF="011207_0006_0F862C7466679E88"/>
that they were ignorant of these great truths of religion: He rather supposed they were "knowing" in them; yea, that they were "well established" in the faith of them. But yet, he judged it "meet" to reiterate the enforcement of these truths; frequently bring∣ing them to their "remembrance," and, by this means, keeping them, as it were, perpe∣tually present in their minds for their spiritual advantage.</P>
<P>AND we may herefrom learn much of the duty of the present ministers of the gospel. They have to do chiefly with those, who may reasonably be supposed to be well instructed al∣ready in the principles and duties of christianity. And their business is, not to gratify their cu∣riosity, by telling them new and strange things; but to "stir up their minds" by way of recol∣lection; to revive in their memories the actual presence of old truths, and to do it in such a manner as that they may, if possible, be quickened and excited by them to the purposes of spiritual edification.</P>
<P>IT may possibly be an objection with some, to giving their attendance on the word publick∣ly preached, that they shall be instructed in nothing new. The preacher, say they, will have nothing to say but what has been often said already. And why should we trou∣ble our selves to go to hear that, which we have heard, and know before?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="011207_0007_0F862C752F32E2C0"/>THE apostle Peter did not think there was any weight in objections of this kind. For he spake very pressingly to the gentile christians concerning the things, which they "knew al∣ready;" yea, and he resolved to go on repeating "these things," though they were "established" in the belief them, as long as he lived.</P>
<P>AND it is, in itself, a "meet," fit thing, that mi∣nisters should repeatedly call people's attention to the things which they "already know" For they really need to have the great truths of God, and religion, urged upon them by reiterated exhortations. Tis not enough, that they are speculatively acquainted with gospel doctrines; but these must be made present to their minds, by a frequent and continued "stirring up" of your memories: Otherwise, though they "know them," they will receive little spiritual benefit from them. For, tis worthy of our no∣tice, the truths of religion, however great and important, can operate upon men, to the produc∣tion of corresponding effects, in no way but by their presence in the mind, and its being actually employed in exercising its thoughts, with reference to them. And in order to this, it is highly proper, in true reason, that they should be frequently made thus present by the mini∣sters of the gospel. Many people would other∣wise, it may be, scarce ever attend to those things which they knew to be truths, and truths too of the greatest importance. For however apt men may be to keep in mind the things that concern their outward, and temporal welfare,
<PB N="10" REF="011207_0008_0F862C75F496EBD0"/>
they are certainly very forgetful of those, which relate to their souls, and their spiritual and ever∣lasting welfare. It is therefore no small part of the work, and duty, of gospel ministers, to bring the great truths of christianity frequently be∣fore the view of their people; calling their atten∣tion to them, and repeatedly fixing their thoughts upon them, if possibly they may have a sutable operation upon their hearts and lives.</P>
<P>THIS was certainly the practice of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. The apostle Peter, in my text, "thought it meet" to enforce the same truths upon the christians he was concern∣ed with, and to be "always diligent" herein. And the apostle Paul applies to the christians at Philippi, in such language as that, (Phil. iii.1.) "Brethren to write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe." And our Savior's character of a wise, and faithful steward of the misteries of the gospel is, "that he brings out of his treasure things that are old as well as new," Matt. xiii.52. And thus our Savior did himself. If we look over the ac∣counts of his preaching, as they are recorded in the four gospels, we shall find that he often urged upon his hearers "the things pertaining to the kingdom of God;" reiterating his in∣structions from time to time, and refreshing their memories by calling them to attend to the "same truths;" and all, that He might fasten them in their hearts, so as to be powerful prin∣ciples of action.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="011207_0009_0F862C76AF1928D0"/>TIS true, our Savior, in his day, and his apostles in theirs, endeavoured to render the "same truths" agreable, by the various man∣ner in which they proposed and urged them. Hence the many parables in which our Savi∣or has set forth the same divine truths. And hence the many similies and metaphors, that are used to express the same thoughts, both by our Lord himself, and his apostles after him.</P>
<P>THOSE, who are entrusted with the care of souls, would do well to place their master, and his apostles, before their view, and to copy after the pattern they have set them. It is proper, I may rather say necessary, we should say the "same things", repeating them over and over again; yet, we should endeavour to do this, not in a round of the same words, but by an agrea∣ble variety in phrase, metaphor, and arange∣ment of thought. It should be our study to "find out acceptable words", so to express our∣selves as that, what we deliver may be handed to our people in a manner as little tedious, and as well-pleasing as may be. And we shall now, in the best adapted way, lay our selves out to preach to them so as that, if it be not owing to themselves, they may be profited, even when their attention is called to those truths, in point of faith or practice, which they knew before, and had been often inculcated on them.—But I must proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">II. SECOND thing observable in my text, and this is, the motive by which the duty mentioned
<PB N="12" REF="011207_0010_0F862C7778F52D40"/>
is enforced. It is contained in those words, "knowing that shortly I must put off this my ta∣bernacle, as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shew∣ed me."</P>
<P>THE apostle, you observe, here speaks of his body figuratively; calling it "his tent, or tabernacle:" and with great propriety and beau∣ty. For the human body is, in its present con∣dition, a frail feeble structure, easily taken down, and designed but for a short continuance. We are "pilgrims and strangers here on earth, as were all our fathers before us", and dwell in tents of clay, from which we shall soon be removed; though blessed be the God of all grace, the time is coming, when these our "vile bodies" shall, if we are "faithful to the death," be fashioned into fixed, durable, glorious buildings, "houses not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."</P>
<P>"PUTTING off" a garment is a common mode of diction; but we do not speak of "putting off" a tent. "Taking it down, or going out of it," is the usual form of expression. Yet the Holy Ghost has been pleased, while comparing the body to a tabernacle, to consider death as "putting off" one's cloths; blending together different metaphors: unless it should be suppo∣sed, which, perhaps, is the truth, that the origi∣nal word (apothesis) here translated "putting off," might as properly be rendered "laying aside", "laying down," as a thing to be used no more; and then there will be no varying of figures.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="011207_0011_0F862C7835E6A908"/>THE apostle says, "he knew that he should lay aside his tabernacle," or, in other words, that he should die. Nor could he have been igno∣rant of this most certain truth. "The living know that they shall die." They know it from the appointment of God, which is of universal extent; taking in the whole human race, with∣out exception or limitation. And they knew it also from the universal empire of death over all the sons and daughters of Adam, whether rich or poor, wise or foolish; or however discrimina∣ted from each other by their stations in life.</P>
<P>HE adds, that he knew that he should "SHORT∣LY lay aside his tabernacle, as our Lord Jesus Christ had shewed him." Some of the ancient fathers have said, that the precise time of his death, which was now near at hand, was made known to him by a vision from heaven; and that, in this way, he knew from Christ, that his continuance here would be "short." But this is nothing more than mere conjecture. Tis true, God acquainted Moses with the approach of his death, and made it certain to the apostle Paul that he should soon be martyred. And he might, by vision, or a voice from heaven, or in some other way, reveal it to Peter that he should "shortly lay aside his earthly tabernacle." But there is no need of any such supposition. And tis most probable, he collected the near approach of his death from those words, in John xxi 18.19. which our Lord spake to him, while he dwelt in flesh. "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, when thou wast young, thou girdedst thy self, and
<PB N="14" REF="011207_0012_0F862C78E826A7F0"/>
walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whi∣ther thou wouldest not". The inspired evan∣gelist adds hereupon, in the following verse, "This spake he (that is Jesus) signifying by what death he should glorify God". Tis cer∣tain, and very obviously so, from those words of our Lord to Peter, that he should die a martyr in his cause, when he was grown old; and be∣ing now a man advanced in age, he "knew" by what "our Lord Jesus Christ had shewed him," many years before, that he must "shortly" die. He firmly believed what he had been told by his Lord, and collected herefrom that the time of his departure was at hand, that he should "shortly" be "girded," and carried to execution for his adherence to the religion of Jesus. And that he did, according to this prediction of Christ, suffer martyrdom, and about the time that he here says he "knew" he should, we have the testimony of Clement of Rome, of Lactan∣tius, Eusebius, and others.</P>
<P>THE composure of mind, the truly christian fortitude, with which he here speaks of his ap∣proaching death, is worthy of special notice. He was, in the first days of his discipleship, shame∣fully intimidated in a time of danger; insomuch that, through the influence of fear, he was over∣come to "deny his Lord," affirming with great vehemency, "I know not the man." But, being recovered by repentance, and growing "strong in faith," and in the grace that is in Christ
<PB N="15" REF="011207_0013_0F862C79A35BC200"/>
Jesus," he became fearless of death, yea, of death by the violence of persecutors; as knowing the truth of christianity, and that, by quitting his tabernacle on earth, for the sake of his master and savior, he should be fixed in a building of God that would be gloriously incapable of being ever pulled down by men, or devils.</P>
<P>INSTEAD of being discouraged, or affrightened, at the knowledge of the nearness of his death, and by the hands of violence, he is rather influ∣enced and quickened to greater zeal and dili∣gence in pressing important, though well-known, truths. He esteemed the "shortness" of his continuance in life a cogent reason, why he should be more laboriously active, if possible, than ever, in urging upon the christians he had opportuni∣ty to preach to, a due regard to the religion of Jesus, they had been already instructed in. And in the doing of this, he mentions that tender and affecting circumstance, "his being to die shortly", because the words of a dying friend are won't ordinarily to come with greater force, and to make the deepest impression on the mind.</P>
<P>AND the consideration of the "shortness" of the time he had to live excited his zeal to "write" as well as to preach, that he might promote the interest of the kingdom of Christ. So we read in the verse immediately following the text, "moreover, I will endeavour that you may be able, after my decease, to have these things al∣ways in remembrance." These things he would endeavour they should "always have in remem∣brance,"
<PB N="16" REF="011207_0014_0F862C7C7B94AB98"/>
were, the necessity of practising the virtues of the christian life, mentioned, v.5. and onwards; and that, if they did so, they should "have an abundant entrance into God's ever∣lasting kingdom." More important truths they could not remember. "These things" the apostle Peter had preached; and, not thinking this sufficient, he committed them to writing in the two epistles that go under his name, that they might be remembered after he was dead and gone. As one justly observes, "He thought writing "much preferable to oral tradition, for preserving the exact knowledge and remem∣brance of truths of the last consequence. And he judged well. For what have we of certainty from "oral tradition?" whereas these two epis∣tles have already continued above 1600 years, and are as able to put us "in remembrance of these things," as ever they were to do the like to christians of former ages. And I doubt not but they will continue to the end of the world, and be of service, wherever they are carefully attended to". The same excellent author adds, those who are heartily concerned for truth and purity, will do all they can to promote them while living, and that truth and righteousness may continue in the world when they are in their grave. St. Peter had the same regard for the christian church, that Laelius expressed for the common-wealth, when he said, "I have no less concern for the common-wealth after my death, than for its prosperity at this present time."</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="011207_0015_0F862C7F13C17AD8"/>But the "motive" in my text, is not peculiar to the apostle Peter. It is adapted, in its nature, to operate powerfully upon all whom it has pleased God to put into the ministry. Tis true, we do not "know," the same way in which Peter did, that we shall "shortly lay aside these our tabernacles"; we may not presume to say, the time of our removal to another world has been "revealed" to us. We know not the day, or hour, or indeed the general period of life, when our Lord will call for us. But this notwith∣standing, we certainly know, because "our Lord Jesus Christ," in the sacred books of scripture, "has shewed us," that our continuance here is short; that, at longest, it will not be long, be∣fore the places that now know us will know us no more. Says the apostle Paul, speaking in the name of Christ, and as authorised by him, "the time is short." And this is the exact truth, should our time be protracted to the utmost length of human life. The sacred penmen, who wrote as they were influenced and guided by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, are repeatedly express in their representations of the brevity of our con∣tinuance here on earth; and to impress our minds with a just and deep sense of it, they not only affirm it as a truth, but make use of the strongest metaphors to convey it to us in the most striking manner. They compare the dura∣tion of life here to "a shadow, which abideth not;" and to "a vapor, which appeareth for a little while, and then vanisheth away." They resemble the speed with which our days pass away to the haste of "a riding post;" to the
<PB N="18" REF="011207_0016_0F862C7FA8554970"/>
"swift motion of a ship under sail;" yea, to the much swifter motion of an "eagle in her flight towards her prey." With such speed do we pass from one period of life to another, till life comes to an end, and we are here no more. Should "the days of our years" extend to "threescore years and ten; yea, should they, "by reason of strength," reach to "forescore years;" yet would they "soon be cut off," they would spend away "as a tale that is told", as the language is in the 90th Psalm.</P>
<P>WHAT more powerful motive, now, can be laid before gospel-ministers, to engage their concern, and influence their endeavours, to stir up their people to "keep in remembrance" the great things that pertain to the kingdom of God, and of Jesus Christ, they may have been already instructed in? Must we "shortly" go out of these earthly tabernacles? Has "our Lord Jesus Christ," by the most lively and af∣fecting descriptions, "shewed us," that our con∣tinuance here will be but a little while, at lon∣gest? Oh! how can we, in this view of life, idle away our days in sloth, or that which is worse; neglecting to keep present in our minds, and in the minds of our people, the momentous truths of God and religion! Ought we not rather to be zealous, active, constant and diligent, in doing the work that is proper to our office as the mini∣sters of Jesus Christ? Is not this infinitely rea∣sonable? Can any thing more important be pro∣posed to us, and urged upon us? Is not the honor of God, the interest of Christ, and our own eternal well being nearly and closely connected
<PB N="19" REF="011207_0017_0F862C8067581138"/>
herewith? Is not Christ our Judge, as well as master? And will he not, when he "appears a second time in his own glory, and in his fathers, with the holy angels," reckon with us for our conduct in the ministerial life? We shall assuredly be called to render an account of the improve∣ment of the great trust that has been committed to us. And if we have approved our selves "faithful to the death," that is the language, in which our Lord will say to us, in the audience of the general assembly of angels and men, "well done, good and faithful servants, enter ye into the joy of your Lord:" But if we have loit∣ered away our days in sloth and negligence, that will be our awful doom, from his mouth, "cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness; there shall be weeping, and gnashing of teeth."</P>
<P>THUS gospel ministers, in common, "know," by what "our Lord Jesus Christ has shewed them," that they shall "shortly lay aside these their tabernacles," from whence they should be excited to the most vigorous exertions in working the work which has been committed to them as their special charge. But there are some, among the ministers of Christ, to whom he is "shewing" that they will still more shortly leave these "houses of clay," whose "foundation is in the dust." So feeble is their make, so weak their constitution, and so many the infirmities they are groaning under, that it is evidently made known to them, that they shall not abide long in the flesh." And this is eminently the case of those, who are ad∣vanced in years, approaching towards, or having
<PB N="20" REF="011207_0018_0F862C81BB1A6AB8"/>
already reached, the general period, the wisdom of God has fixed for the duration of life. As for such, they know, because it has been "shewed" to them by the revelation of Jesus Christ, that the time of their departure is at hand. They are ignorant, it is true, of the precise time, when they must leave this present world; but they certainly know, in general, that "the earthly house of their tabernacle" will shortly, very shortly, "be dissolved". And what a pow∣erful motive is this to make them diligent and faithful in "stirring up" their people, by "put∣ting them in remembrance" of the great and necessary truths of christianity? These ought to have a most lively and affecting presence in their own minds. Their nearness to another world renders it eminently proper, I may say absolute∣ly necessary. And if they have upon their own minds an impressive sense of the infinite impor∣tance of the great truths of God and religion, how can it be but that they should zealously en∣deavour to awaken, and keep alive, in the minds of their people, the like serious and affecting sense of these things? They must now bestir themselves, or they never will. For their time is short. In a little while, at longest, their sun will set, and the night come on, when they can no more employ themselves in services for their own souls, or the souls of those whom Christ has made their peculiar charge. They should therefore "do with their might whatsoever their hands find to do;" remembring, that there is "no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, whither they are going," and where they will shortly be laid.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="011207_0019_0F862C825333B1F8"/>THIS I would consider as particularly applica∣ble to my self. I am now approaching towards the time, beyond which "the Lord Jesus Christ has shewed me" in the sacred books, that I cannot dwell in this my fleshly tabernacle, unless I had "great strength," which I know I have not. It was far from my thoughts, some years ago, that I should have lived to bear a part in that special service, which may be ex∣pected this day. But, having obtained help from God, I am continued to you, notwithstand∣ing all my unworthiness and sinfulness, and with some ability, according to the measure of the gift of grace bestowed on me, to go on with the Lord's work among you. May a sense of his great goodness sutably <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ect my heart! And may I from the consideration, that I shall shortly be called from you, be powerfully constrained to the greatest zeal, activity, diligence, and fidelity in my ministerial labor for the good of your souls. Brethren, "pray for me." Your so do∣ing will be for your own advantage, as well as mine. If the good God, in answer to your constant, fervent supplications before his mercy-seat in heaven, shall be pleased to be present with me, with the aids of his grace, enabling me to be faithful; at the same time, succeeding my faithful endeavours, so as that the gospel may have its saving effect upon you, I shall then, of the abounding mercy of God, through the a∣toning merit of the great Redeemer, receive the "crown of life;" and you will be "my crown and joy," in the day of the appearing of Jesus Christ "without sin unto salvation."</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="011207_0020_0F862C82C8CB4C08"/>AND I would the rather "beseech you, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me", as it has seemed good to the alwise, righteous, and holy sovereign of the world, to take to himself, by sudden death, "my companion, and fellow-laborer, in the kingdom, and patience of Jesus Christ".</P>
<P>HAD he been permitted to live till the 23d of Oct. next, we should have continued your colleague Pastors the full space of forty two years. It can't be supposed, I should want an inclination to do justice to the memory of one to whom I have been so long, and so nearly re∣lated. And I may, perhaps, from my intimate acquaintance with him, be thought to be the most proper, and best qualified person, to delineate his character.—But should I do this; it might, perhaps be contrary to what he would have chosen.</P>
<P>You all know, he restrained himself from ser∣vices of this kind. He never attempted, in my day, so far as I can recollect to give a funeral character, but once. It was upon occasion of the death of president WADSWORTH, who had, for several years, been a joint-labourer with him in the pastoral care of this Church. This he called "an extraordinary case," and made it his apology for doing that, which, with him, was so unusual a thing. The present case is as "extraordinary"; and will as well justifie me, as it could him, and upon the same principles,
<PB N="23" REF="011207_0021_0F862C83712B1CC8"/>
should I endeavour to take some notice of the qualities, in my deceased brother, which render∣ed him so valuable a servant of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>IT pleased the former of the spirit of man within him to send him into the world with in∣tellectual powers, much beyond the common size; and his advantages in childhood and youth for their culture by education were such as gave occasion for their enlargement in a still more noble degree. Not many exceeded him in quick∣ness of apprehension, clearness of perception, copiousness of invention, liveliness of imaginati∣on, strength of memory, soundness of judgment, and the faculty of reasoning. Of these natural accomplishments, strengthened by improvement, his publications are a specimen; and they will do honor to him, as they have already done, in the opinion of all capable judges.</P>
<P>HE was a friend to liberty, especially that "liberty wherewith our Lord Jesus Christ has made his churches free." In his younger years, particularly while at college, and under the pre∣judice of education, his father being an episco∣palian by profession and principle, he entertained so strong an opinion of the "English ecclesiasti∣cal establishment," that it was his full intention to take orders in the church of England, and would scarce be persuaded to read any authors but those of that communion. But▪ after he had proceeded batchelor of arts, in consequence of diligent study, and free conversation, he altered his sentiments, professing a firm adherence to the
<PB N="24" REF="011207_0022_0F862C84317C6D30"/>
mode of worship and government practiced in the New-England churches. And though he always retained a candid charitable opinion of those members of the Episcopal church whose be∣havior was as becometh godliness; yet it was his full persuasion, that the church it self was defiled with the inventions of man, and laid an undue restraint upon true christian liberty. I know of no one that was, upon principle, a more zealous friend to the manner of worship and discipline in these churches, and that more earnestly de∣precated those innovations with which we have been threatned He has in as masterly a way, and with as comprehensive knowledge, wrote in defence of our "ordination by the hands of the presbytery," as any one I could name.</P>
<P>HE was also a fast friend to our college at cambridge, sought its welfare, and laid himself out, within his proper sphere, to do it all the service in his power.</P>
<P>HE was young when ordained a pastor of this church; but well qualified with gifts, and had, I trust, before that time, been made a partaker of the "grace that is in Christ Jesus." He was, in that day, much applauded for his ministerial accomplishments. Multitudes flocked to hear him. No minister in town, or country, was ac∣counted either a more polite and elegant, or a more devout and edifying preacher. And this was the general voice concerning him, till disor∣ders, we are all liable to, weakened the vigor, perhaps, of his mind, as well as body. This
<PB N="25" REF="011207_0023_0F862C858CAF9AB8"/>
was undoubtedly the case, in some of his later years. And if that christian candor, which might reasonably have been expected from those especially who had enjoyed the benefit of his for∣mer more vigorous labors, had been in due exer∣cise, it would have been no hindrance to their spiri∣tual edification. Had he lived till the 20th of No∣vember next, he would have been your fixed pastor for the long space of fifty two years. I bear him witness, he had an affectionate con∣cern for your spiritual welfare, to which it was owing that he exhorted, rebuked, comforted, and charged you as a father doth his children; being willing to impart to you not only the gos∣pel of the blessed God, but his own soul also, because you were dear to him. Should I call you to it, you would openly declare, that he had been an "example to you in word, in con∣versation, in charity, in faith, in purity," and in all those other virtues which adorn the christian's and the minister's character. Brethren, "you are witnesses, and God also, how holily, and justly, and unblamably, he behaved himself among you;" approving himself "a minister of God, in much patience, in labor, in watchings, in fastings, by pureness, by knowledge, by long∣suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand, and on the left."</P>
<P>I may go on, and say, those acquainted with Mr. Foxcroft must have observed his laudable
<PB N="26" REF="011207_0024_0F862C85B0CE0C90"/>
behaviour in the various relations of life. When an husband, how faithful and kind! As a father, how careful to instruct, guide, and govern his children! As a master, how just and equal! As a neighbour, how ready to all the offices of christian goodness! As a minister, how diligent, constant, and laborious in doing the duties of his calling! How skilful a divider of the word of truth! How pungent in his applications to the souls of his hearers! How careful to adapt his discourses to the various occurrences in provi∣dence that they might, by this means, be the more seasonable, and profitable! How fervent was his zeal for the cause of God and religion! How resolute his boldness in testifying against vice, and apprehended error! fearing the face of no man, while persuaded in his own mind he was doing that, which would be acceptable in the sight of God. He shone with great bright∣ness as a preacher, while in the full enjoyment of health and strength. He was indeed a tho∣rough divine. He had a general knowledge of most of the learned arts; was a good gramma∣rian, well acquainted both with latin and greek, especially the new-testament greek, in which his criticisms were frequent, and just; and such, as if collected together, and placed in one view before the public, would give him an high repu∣tation in the learned world. But he excelled in his knowledge of divinity. This was his principal study; and he has left few who were equal to him.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="011207_0025_0F862C8683961B28"/>HE was, by bodily constitution, liable to sud∣denness, which was heightned by the ill state of his health; but he made it his care to govern his resentments, keeping them under the re∣straints of reason and religion. He was himself a stranger to all the arts of intrigue and dissimu∣lation, and detested them in others. His con∣versation was serious, but not affected; pleasant and affable, but not light and vain. He had a turn for satyr, which he could express with an emphatical air, but was always cautious that he did not needlesly give offence.</P>
<P>HIS religion, though spiritual, was substanti∣al; not tainted with superstition, not made ridiculous by the influence of enthusiasm. He was, in the judgment of all who were acquaint∣ed with him, a real good christian; a partaker of the Holy Ghost, and of that faith in the re∣velations of God which purified his heart, wro't by love, and influenced his whole conduct in life. He was uniform and steady in his walk with God, in the way of his commandments: though, instead of "trusting that he was righte∣ous" in the eye of strict law, he accounted himself an "unprofitable servant"; fixing his dependence, not on his own worthiness, not on any works of righteousness which he had done, but on the mercy of God, and the atoning blood, and perfect righteousness, of Jesus Christ the Savior.</P>
<P>HE had upon his mind, for some time before
<PB N="28" REF="011207_0026_0F862C87237210F0"/>
his death, a prevailing apprehension, that he should soon go the way of all the earth; which he more than once signified to his children, and to a friend going a long journey, taking his final farewell and saying, "She would see him no more". Whether it was from this apprehension, or the general seasonableness of speaking to his people upon such a subject I know not; but it may be worthy of notice, the four last Sermons he preached was from those words, in the book of Job, "all the days of my appointed time I will wait, till my change comes." It may na∣turally be supposed, he was, in some of the last weeks of his life, particularly thoughtful of the great change by death, and diligent in his pre∣paration for it.</P>
<P>THE manner of God's calling him out of the world was sudden and violent. He was so deep∣ly struck, as, in a few minutes, to be deprived both of his reason and his senses; and, in this lethargic state he continued about twenty eight hours, when he fell asleep in Jesus; with whom, we trust, he is now present, in the paradise of God, resting from his labors, and enjoying the happi∣ness that is proper to the "spirits of just men made perfect."</P>
<P>YOU, his dear relatives, I know, think thus concerning him; and while this is your faith, you can have no reason to "weep for him", however you may "weep for your selves."</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="011207_0027_0F862C886F2B12C0"/>WE wish for you all the aids of divine grace, whereby you may be enabled so to improve this dispensation in the alwise government of God, as that it may be for your spiritual profit here, and eternal well being hereafter.</P>
<P>WE particularly unite in our supplications be∣fore the throne of mercy for the children, from whom it has pleased God to take an affectionate father. Be thankful he was so long continued to you, and that you enjoyed so great a blessing in him. And take it not amiss, if I, who was joined with him, and so long lived his fellow-wor∣ker in the kingdom of Christ, do now in his stead, and in God's name, seriously and solemnly give it in charge to you, "to know the God of your father▪ and to serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind". And let me assure you, "if you seek him, he will be found of you; but if you forsake him, he will cast you off fore∣ver." The language of the bereavement you are visited with is that, "wilt thou not from this time, cry unto me, my father! Thou art my guide." And if you thus chuse God for your father and friend, you will reap the com∣fort of so happy a choice all along in life; and may triumph in those comforting words, "this God is our God—he will be our guide unto death, and through death, and our portion for∣ever." We wish for the surviving son a double portion of that good Spirit which rested on his father; and may he long be continued a rich blessing to the church of Christ in general, and to that flock of his in special, over which the Holy Ghost has placed him!</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="011207_0028_0F862C88CCEC1718"/>I NEED not, my brethren, recommend to your kind regards the children of the deceased, who lived in his family. You not only made season∣able provision for the decent, respectful funeral of their father, but have done generously for them also. Forget not still to do them good, as there may be occasion; for "with such sacrifices God is well pleased."</P>
<P>AND now, "dearly beloved in the Lord", shall it not be your care to make a wise and good use of this article in the conduct of heaven towards you? will you not adore before the dread Sovereign of the world, who is "righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works"; gi∣ving him the glory of a profound submission to his alwise pleasure?</P>
<P>HAS your now dead pastor been a spiritual father to any of you, having begotten you to Christ, through the gospel, under the influence of the Holy Ghost? You will surely remember him in love! You can never forget him, who, under God, has been salvation to you.—Have any of you, by his public ministry, or private conversation, been supported under tryals, en∣lightned in darkness, comforted in tribulation, or strengthned to go on with speed and vigor in the way towards heaven? you cannot but speak of him with thankfulness to God—His memory, with you, will be always blessed. But if any of you, instead of hearkning to the coun∣sels, admonitions, exhortations, and warnings,
<PB N="31" REF="011207_0029_0F862C8A23607CF0"/>
which God dispensed to you by his mouth, have stopped your ears, and hardened your hearts, and are to this day secure in sin; "walking in the way of your heart, and in the sight of your eye", you have infinite reason for deep humilia∣tion. You have cast contempt on God, by not paying a sutable regard to the messages sent to you by this his servant; and unless you repair to gospel mercy, in the exercise of unfeigned repentance, he will appear a swift witness against you in the day, when "God shall judge the world by the man Jesus," whom he hath ordain∣ned to transact this important business.</P>
<P>AND may all, who are members of this an∣cient society, "remember what you have heard, and hold fast" the profession of your faith. I beseech you, brethren, and exhort you, by the Lord Jesus Christ, "that as ye have received" of your deceased pastor "how ye ought to walk, so that we would abound more and more. "Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die." He that "walketh in the midstof the golden candlesticks, and holds the stars in his right hand," has "somewhat against us, because we have left our first love." Let us "remember from whence we are fallen, and repent, and do the first works." Our blessed Lord, I trust, has yet a "a few names in this his Sardis, who have not defiled their garments: and they shall walk with him in white, for they are worthy." May the number be increased in∣to a great multitude! We are the first christian church that was ever formed in this town. May
<PB N="32" REF="011207_0030_0F862C8A2D3A4EE0"/>
we be the first in spiritual glory! May it please the great head over all things to add to our num∣bers, and to our graces! And may we go on shining in all the beauties of holiness, till we are "presented a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle, before God, even the father," in that kingdom which shall have no end!</P>
<P>I SHALL not think it a digression, if I say, that the death we are solemnising is a loud call in pro∣vidence to the ministers of the Town, the asso∣ciated ones in special. He was one of our num∣ber, often with us in consultation for the interest of the kingdom of Jesus, and an ancient venera∣ble, and highly valuable member. And, by his removal into the other world, we are taught by our Lord, that we also shall "shortly put off these our tabernacles." May we hear his voice, and, in imitation of him "work" with zeal and diligence "the work of him that sent us"; re∣membering that "the night cometh when we cannot work! May those among us, in particu∣lar, attend to it, who have been permitted to live till we are far advanced in years! Of the eleven associated pastors in this town, one has exceeded four-score years; another threescore years and ten; four have reached beyond threescore years; one is above fifty, and another above forty years old. Three only of our number are young men. But they may die in the strength and vigor of life. A serious thought! and it should quicken their zeal, and animate their resolution, to be faithful and diligent in fulfilling the ministry
<PB N="32" REF="011207_0031_0F862C8AE4F27B18"/>
they have had committed to them. But, for us who are grown into years, "our Lord Jesus Christ has shewed us" by his word, and is "shew∣ing us" in his providence, that we must shortly depart. May our hearts be duly impressed with a just sense of this momentous truth! And may it influence us to the most arduous en∣deavors, that we may finish our course with joy!</P>
<P>There will, my brethren, in a few years at longest, come on a great change of ministers in this Town. Most of the present ones will, according to the course of nature, very short∣ly be laid in their graves. May their be a succession of those, who shall be eminently instrumental in serving the Redeemer's interest in these churches! Perhaps, there never was a town, in any part of the world, since the days of the apostles, more signally blessed than this has been, from its beginning, with skilful, able, faithful gospel ministers. Instead of those that are gone, and going, off the stage of life and action, may that God, with whom is the residue of the spirit, raise up, and qualify, others to supply their places, and to do more worthily for him in their day and generation!</P>
<P>IT were to be wished, that both ministers and people would continually entertain in their minds the thought, that they dwell in weak feeble tabernacles, that will shortly be broke to pieces by this or the other disease, or dis∣aster, in the providential government of God.
<PB N="33" REF="011207_0032_0F862C8CA45B3C58"/>
Ministers would then preach, and their people would then hear, as becomes dying men. And such preaching, and such hearing, would, under the blessing of God, be effec∣tual to the salvation of ministers themselves, and those that hear them.</P>
<P>NOW to the only living, unchangeable, immortal God, be given all glory, honor, majesty and Dominion, by the church of Christ, throughout all ages, in this world; and throughout eternity, in the coming one. AMEN and AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>Appendix. From the <HI>Massachusetts Gazette,</HI> of June 22. 1769.</HEAD>
<P>LAST saturday morning, the Reverend Mr. THOMAS FOXCROFT, senior Pastor of the first Church in this Town, was suddenly struck with a disorder, partly apo∣plectic, partly palsaic, which deprived him of his reason, locked up his senses, and put an end to his life the following day, about ele∣ven of the clock, in the seventy third year of his Age.</P>
<P>HE was born in Boston, but in early child∣hood became an inhabitant of Cambridge, the seat of Harvard-College; where he was favored with as good an education as could be had in the country, in that day. This, toge∣ther with the superior intellectual powers, the Father of spirits was pleased to bestow on them, laid the foundation for those learned accom∣plishments, which distinguished him from most of his brethren in the ministry. He took his degrees of Bachelor and Master of Arts in the years 1714, and 1717. His Father, FRANCIS FOXCROFT, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> a Member of the Church of
<PB REF="011207_0034_0F862C8DEA6EFDC8"/>
England, tho' candid in his sentiments of other denominations of christians, which he signified by statedly joining in worship with the Congregational Church at Cambridge, where he resided, the remaining part of his life, after he left Boston:—His Father in∣tended he should be an Episcopal Clergy∣man. And this was his own intention, till, by diligent study, and free conversation with that great Reasoner, and eminently pious Man, the Rev. Mr. NEHEMIAH WALTER, (then Pastor of the Church at Roxbury, in which place he was called to be at the head of a Grammar-School for a few years,) he was obli∣ged to think, that the mode of worship and government in our Churches, was more agreeable to <HI>Scripture Rule</HI> than that of the English Church. In the year 1729, he published, in answer to "Mr. T. Barclay's Persuasive," which had been distributed in New-England, his work entitled, "the <HI>ruling</HI> and <HI>ordaining</HI> Power of <HI>Congregati∣onal Bishops,</HI> or <HI>Presbyters</HI> defended;" in which he shewed himself a master in this controversy. The Power of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> or <HI>Scripture Bishops</HI> to ordain and <HI>govern,</HI> is here set in a strong point of light: Few have wrote upon the subject with greater clearness, more accuracy, or ful∣ler extent of knowledge. This highly valua∣ble performance has received no answer to this day.</P>
<P>IN the Month of March, 1717, he was called to the pastoral office of the first Church in this Town, and on the 20th of Novem∣ber following was ordained their Minister in
<PB REF="011207_0035_0F862C8EAC622308"/>
partnership with the Rev. Mr. BENJAMIN WADSWORTH. Perhaps, no Minister in Boston, upon his first settlement, was ever more uni∣versally admired. He was then held in high re∣putation, as one of the best accomplished preachers; and this continued to be the ge∣neral opinion of him, till there came on a change in the taste of people, and in the vigor of his constitution by repeated disor∣ders of one kind or another. His published Sermons, upon a great variety of occasions, and in all the periods of his ministerial life, will do honor to him as long as there are any capable judges of justness of thought, copi∣ousness of invention, elegance of stile, strength of reasoning, enlivened with a spirit of piety running through the whole. He was in sen∣timent a strict <HI>Calvanist</HI>; though catholic in his disposition towards others who did not think just as he did. And, what ought to be men∣tioned to his honor, he was no TRIMMER, but steadily and uniformly adhered to the <HI>Calvinian</HI> principles, which he took to be the true Scripture ones; making them the chief subjects of his pulpit discourses, as he thought he should hereby "please God," if he did not always "please Men." It may be justly said of Mr. FOXCROFT, that he was a good scholar, an able critick, both in Greek and Latin, and considerably acquainted with most of the arts and sciences; though Di∣vinity was his favorite study, in which he excelled; not having left many, if indeed any
<PB REF="011207_0036_0F862C8F7875BC40"/>
superior to him. But the best and greatest thing that can be said of him is, that he was, as we have abundant reason to believe, a good christian, and a faithful minister of Jesus Christ, in whose service he labored, as a fixed pastor, nearly fifty-two years. He was called, in this period of time, to pass through a variety of trials, as well as ser∣vices, which gave opportunity for the exer∣cise and establishment of many virtues, both private and social, by which he honored God, did good in his generation, and was formed to a greater meetness for the enjoyment of the upper world, to which he was admit∣ted, as we trust, of the free rich mercy of God through Jesus Christ, at the day of his departure hence.</P>
<P>He has left behind a Son and five Daugh∣ters, for whom we wish the guidance and blessing of him who has stiled himself "the father of the fatherless."</P>
<P>He was buried yesterday with all decent respect; the Church to which he had long ministred bearing the expence of the funeral.</P>
