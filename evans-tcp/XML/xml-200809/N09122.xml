<BIBL>Jer. xxviii 16.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>—This year thou shalt die.—</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHAT is said of general rules may be applied to general maxims; for hard∣ly any one of either holds true in every case. What maxims more general than these three <HI>—All must die— None knoweth the time of his death—Ignorance of the time is better than the knowledge of it</HI>? Yet each of these hath many exceptions. The text is an exception to the second maxim, and possibly to the third; other texts there are which afford exceptions to the first, What I intend to do is, To dis∣course on those exceptions; and then to address you in such a manner as may be suitable to the time and the text.</P>
<P N="1">I. The first maxim asserts that <HI>all must die,</HI> —This is a decree of heaven, and is expressed in general terms throughout the Bible. The reason of the decree comports with the gene∣rality of its terms, for <HI>all have sinned,</HI> Rom. v. 12; nevertheless the execution thereof will not seem adequate to either. Enoch and Elijah sinned but died not, Heb. xi. 5.2 King. ii 11.
<PB N="4" REF="011642_0003_0F879E6970CD39A0"/>
The saints on Earth at the coming of Christ will not be sinless, yet none of them shall die; and they perhaps may amount to many thou∣sands or millions. 1 Cor. xv. 51. But if these exemptions of sinners from death be real, how can death be the <HI>wages of sin</HI>? how will the veracity of God appear in saying, <HI>the soul that sinneth shall die</HI>? I answer, Christ died for all the sinners who die not. And his death was substituted in the room of theirs, and consider∣ed of God and of his law as their own. But did not Christ die for others, even for all the elect? Why then are not all exempted from dying? I answer, It is not because the death of Christ was less proxical or less satisfactory in the case of the one party than of the other; but for some good reasons or designs unknown to us. The death of saints however differs not much from athanacy. It is no penal evil. A sting it has not. <HI>Falling asleep</HI> is a just representation of it. Some have desired it as an usher to glory, and lamented a recovery out of fits which, in their access, they took to be death itself. I have met with an instance of this last, in my own house the thirteenth of August past; and that from a person who was very near and dear to me; which helped me much in the midst of my sorrows.</P>
<P N="2">II. The second maxim is <HI>That no man know∣eth the time of his death.</HI> This, though it be not scriptural, obtains in the world as an uni∣versal truth. But it has exceptions. And I intend under this head to shew—That some
<PB N="5" REF="011642_0004_0F879E6A16958650"/>
have known the times of their death; and to mention the ways and means whereby they obtained that knowledge.</P>
<P N="1">1. I am to shew that some have certainly known the time of their death. And what has been may be again. Hananiah knew the year in which he should die, as appears by the text. Hezekiah must have known as much. Isaiah xxxviii. 19. Saul knew the day of his death. 1 Sam. xxviii. 19. Dives, the night in which his Soul should be required of him. Luke xii. 20. Profane history abounds with names of persons who have foretold, some the year, some the month, and some the day of their de∣cease; such as Justin Martyr, Cyprian, and others among the ancients. Hale, Usher, Jewell, Tyro and Peden, among the moderns. To which I could add some instances, which have fallen under my own observation. All these died at the times predicted, and therefore must have known the times. Come we</P>
<P N="2">2. To speak of the ways and means by which men have attained to that knowledge. Hananiah and Hezekiah were informed of the fatal time by prophets. Saul by a speaking apparation. Tyro by an audible voice which said 'Thou shalt not pass the thirty fourth year of thy age,' Polycarp, in a vision, saw his martyrdom and the manner of it three days before it came. Cyprian and Usher dis∣covered the precise time of their death, by dreams. Hale, Jewell, and Peden by an <HI>un∣accountable</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="011642_0005_0F879E6D6FC6A6E0"/>
premonition or boding that rose in their minds, by which the first informed his acquaintance 'that on such a day or the same day month he should be no more', which last brought the event to pass. The next told several 'that within forty eight hours he should be in eternity'. The other said 'this day is to be my last'; in all which cases events proved predictions. A gentlewoman in town had something of this premonitive or forebod∣ing impression on her mind for a considerable time, and had been heard to say 'that she should die with her eighth child'; and in her eighth pregnancy she died August 16, 1769. I myself know a man who, on the ninth day of March, in the year 1755, was seized with a persuasion, <HI>That at the end of full fifteen years, from that time, he should be dead.</HI> The impression was sudden and strong; so strong as not to leave a doubt respecting the issue, and has continued the same to this day. About four years after he told a friend of it; that friend endeavouring to rally him out of the notion made the thing known abroad, which was presently spoken of in various ways. But the above is the state of the case. Whether a pre∣monition or a deception time will show, and that time is at hand : if the first, the thing will claim no praise because involuntary; if the last, others have been deceived the same way without blame, and that for the same reason.</P>
<P N="3">III. The other maxim is, <HI>That perfect igno∣rance of the time of death is better than a know∣ledge
<PB N="7" REF="011642_0006_0F879E6F009E62E0"/>
of it.</HI> And I believe this, because God leaves most men in the dark about the matter. Whatever is, is best. But as it is certain that God hath shewn to some their times of disso∣lution, We must for the same reason believe the opposite of the above maxim in their cases; otherwise neither God's prophets nor God's providence would have disclosed the secret. The designs of providence in concealing from most men the number of their days may be seen in Drelincourt on death. But his designs in making known to some the periods of their existence I can only guess at.</P>
<P N="1">1. When God makes the discovery to a wicked man it may be to hasten his amendment. The thing has a peculiar aptitude to answer the end; else why does a physician inform a wicked patient, or a judge inform a criminal that he has but so many hours to live? Aha∣ziah, Hananiah, and Saul were wicked men; and who knows but God meant to pluck these sons of Abraham as brands out of the burning by the discoveries he made touching the near∣ness of their deaths. Certain it is that Saul fell to the ground, fasted, and sorrowed much when he heard the fatal sentence <HI>to morrow shalt thou be among the dead</HI>! Certain also, that the sentence of a judge or a physician hath made wretches think seriously and think speedily of a preparation for death who could not be mov∣ed thereto by any other means.</P>
<P N="2">2. When God shows a good man the time of his death it may be, either for a brighter
<PB N="8" REF="011642_0007_0F879E7037F21908"/>
display of his piety. How gloriously pious did the King of Israel appear when he was told that he should die and not live. Isaiah xxxviii. Or, for exciting him to greater diligence. Peter confesses that it had this effect upon him. 2. Pet, I. 14. Or else to give him an oppor∣tunity of knowing his state. Belshazzer knew not what a wretch he was till he saw on the wall how soon he should die, Dan. v. But when Paul knew that the time of his departure was at hand he felt more comfortable and happy than before. 2 Tim. iv. 8. But whether the above be the reasons why God doth discover the secret to some few may be doubted; yet that he hath made such discoveries, and that to both wicked and good men, cannot be doubted at all.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I proceed to the second thing I promis∣ed viz. to address you in a manner that may suit the text, and the time; and that will, by the blessing of God, be of benefit to each of you.</P>
<P N="1">I. The time, you know, is the first day of the new year, and that which connects it with the old; on which account it, like Janus, casts a double aspect, the one on the year past; and the other on the year begun. It will be suitable to the time therefore to say something of it both in its retrospection, and prospect. If, with the day, we look back to the year it pushes from us we shall see cause for thanks∣giving; and sorrow; thanksgiving for a year's
<PB N="9" REF="011642_0008_0F879E70EE2E9608"/>
bounties; and sorrow for a year's sins. Every day and every night of the last year yielded us some favours. God's mercy was new every morning; and his faithfulness repeated every night. He gave us food and raiment, and health, and liberty. He gave us his sabbaths, his gospel, and his means of grace. He gave us hope, and supported it by tokens of his love. He hath borne with us and spared us a year longer. He hath crowned the year with good∣ness. Thanks therefore be to his holy name. But these thanks are to be mingled with sor∣rows. We have a year's sins to bewail. How many these have been God only knows; but we easily know the number of them to have been great. Not a day nor a night passed with∣out producing some wants of conformity to, or or transgressions of the law and gospel. O, Lord we look back with shame from the begin∣ning of this year; we judge and condemn our∣selves, and most humbly ask forgiveness of the past year's sins! But if with the day, we look forward to the year commenced we have a pros∣pect big with instructions. It meets us with calls to resolve, to pray and to strive. To re∣solve that in the name and strength of God we will spend this year better than the past. To pray that God will be bountiful and kind to us as he hath been the last year, and to strive to offend him less, to please him better, and to love him more. Such resolutions, prayers, and strivings suit the time well, but suit our own character and interest much better.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="011642_0009_0F879E7196A77FE0"/>2. Having said so much to the time I will add somewat that may be suitable to the pe∣culiar nature of the text. It is a very alarm∣ing one to wicked men; but pleasing, highly pleasing to the righteous. <HI>This year thou shalt die</HI>! What, die? and that, this year? Alarming in∣deed! Every syllable sounds like the ticking of a death-watch! Observe! Death is in the text! And a specification of <HI>this year</HI> for the time of death to some one or other! But who is that one? I answer, <HI>possibly</HI> every one here— <HI>probably</HI> many a one—and <HI>certainly</HI> some one or other! It is possible that every one of us may be dead before the end of this year; for the world is grown old. And where is the man or the angel that will insure its continuance for a month, a week, or a day longer? Or if the end of all things be not at hand who can say that neither the sword, nor famine, nor pesti∣lence, nor Indians, nor earthquake shall put an end to us all in three hundred and sixty five days? May I not repeat my text therefore to express a possibility of what may befall <HI>every one</HI> of us this year? But possibilities are light things. Therefore I add, that the text will <HI>probably</HI> be verified this year in the case of <HI>many a one</HI> here. This congregation consists now of an hundred and forty nine communicants; and as many hearers besides as will augment the number to about four hundred. If we suppose that five in a hundred will die (and the bills of mortality for years past justify the supposition) a score will never see another new-year's day. Shall I then repeat the text to express with probality that
<PB N="11" REF="011642_0010_0F879E726008C670"/>
this year twenty of us shall die? and shall not this affect us? I am sure the thought affects me; for some of the twenty may be the best friends which the society has! But I may pro∣ceed to <HI>certainty</HI> in applying the text. It is <HI>certain,</HI> morally <HI>certain</HI> that <HI>some one</HI> of us will die this year. To suppose the contrary were to suppose such a thing as never happened in any other society of equal number. There stands among you one who firmly believes that he is the man. But let not that draw the at∣tention of any other from himself, for <HI>probably</HI> several more will never see the end of this year.</P>
<P>I have just now said 'that my text is a word of fear to a wicked man, but a word of conso∣lation to the righteous'. And of one or the other character are all present. Shall I suppose here be some of both, and as such address them on the subject of dying this year?</P>
<P N="1">I. Is there a graceless person in the place, whether young or old or of middle age?— If young, and entering on this new year in a condition unfit for death, must I in thy hearing repeat a text which declares that <HI>this year thou shalt die?</HI> Canst thou hear it without emo∣tion; or be assured that thou art not the ob∣ject of the prediction? I trow not. Wilt thou not then begin to prepare for dying in the begin∣ning of this year of death? Wilt thou go on as heretofore? Forgetting thy creator? With∣holding thy neck from his yoke? Avoiding a profession of his religion? Acting the <HI>child of
<PB N="12" REF="011642_0011_0F879E732F950F90"/>
disobedience</HI> towards the duties, the ordinances and calls thereof? Pursuing pleasure and gid∣diness? Putting off the care of the soul with re∣ference to eternity, and so die? God forbid! Thou comely youth! thou fair damsel it must not be! The thought will distress thy friends and distract thy parents! Alas! alas! that so much excellency should perish this year! that so much comeliness and beauty should this year again go to sin and then to hell? I pray you, my young hearers, I pray you in Christ's stead that ye be reconciled to God this year. If ye seek him early ye shall find him. Prov. viii. 17.—If there be a graceless man or a graceless woman in the assembly, and I should address him in the language of the text, how will he bear it, or how gainsay it, <HI>This year thou shalt die</HI>! I hope thou wilt not bear so awful a denunciation as thou wouldest a light thing? nor defer a preparation for the event as if sure that thou art not the object of the prophecy! God forbid! For if thou die this year, and art not born again this year, thou wilt this year be in torments! O man! let this beginning of the year be the be∣ginning of the newness of life with thee, and the end of a graceless and unconverted state! To be men grown and women grown and that in a state of guilt and irreligion is to have run too great risques already. Dread to do so this year also; for it may be the last, and you ru∣ined forever!—Or is there an old sinner in this assembly? An ancient man or an an∣cient woman who hath borne the heat and burden of the day in labouring for all things
<PB N="13" REF="011642_0012_0F879E73DC768790"/>
except the <HI>one thing needful?</HI> If there be, let him hear the word of the Lord, <HI>this year thou shalt die</HI>! Surely 'tis the eleventh hour with thee! thy gray hairs, thy feeble and tottering frame and thy broken voice declare it. And wilt thou stand idle in the market place till that hour expire with the rest? God forbid. I have somewhere read this epitaph, HERE LIES AN OLD MAN AGED THREE YEARS; for three years before his death he had been converted. But if thou die this year, and art not convert∣ed what shall we write on thy tomb? Shall we write, 'Here is buried an ancient man or an ancient woman aged nothing? Who had not as much as a being in Christ before his gray hairs went down to the grave? Forbid it, merciful God! Ancient of days, forbid it!</P>
<P N="2">2. I shift the scene; for I see or believe I see in the assembly some youth, some men and some women, some ancients and matrons who are ripe for glory. I rejoice over you; for to each of you a repetition of the text will be the voice of a charmer and a prophecy of smooth things! This year each may be in heaven! How is it proved? Thus—<HI>This year thou shalt die!</HI> My good child! If thou die this year thou shalt be with him that loveth little children and that was once called, <HI>the child Jesus</HI>! What if thy tongue could but lisp his name while rehears∣ing thy catechism the last year? This year may make thee as the babes and sucklings in the temple, whose mouths uttered perfect praise, for <HI>this year thou shalt die?</HI> Comely youth
<PB N="14" REF="011642_0013_0F879E74AA587440"/>
and fair damsel! doubly fair and comely be∣cause good! does the text say <HI>thou shalt die this year?</HI> Thine heart replies, <HI>So be it,</HI> that I may be in heaven this year, and so be young and fair and comely and happy forever! Thou man or woman in Christ, Harken! <HI>This year thou shalt die</HI>! O how good to thee is this word of the Lord; for the desire of thine heart is to be in heaven. Venerable father or mother in Israel! Ripe for glory art thou, and desirous to enter upon it! Methinks I see thee in the meeting, like Simeon or Anna in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, embracing thy Lord by faith and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>,ing to depart and be in heaven. I will do thee a pleasure for the pleasure thou givest, <HI>this year thou shalt die.</HI></P>
