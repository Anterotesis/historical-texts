<HEAD>TREATY of Amity and Commerce between his Most Christian Majesty, and the thirteen United States of America.</HEAD>
<P>THE Most Christian King, and the thirteen United States of North America, <HI>to wit,</HI> New-Hampshire, Massachusetts-bay, Rhode-Island, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, willing to fix, in an equitable and permanent manner, the rules which ought to be followed relative to the correspond∣ence and commerce which the two parties desire to es∣tablish between their respective countries, states, and sub∣jects; his Most Christian Majesty, and the said United States, have judged, that the said end could not be better obtained, than by taking for the basis of their agreement, the most perfect equality and reciprocity, and by carefully avoiding all those burdensome preferences, which are usually sources of debate, embarrassment, and discontent —by leaving also each party at liberty to make, respect∣ing commerce and navigation, those interior regulations, which it shall find most convenient to itself—and by found∣ing the advantage of commerce solely upon reciprocal utility, and the just rules of free intercourse—reserving withal, to each party, the liberty of admitting, at its pleas∣ure, other nations to a participation of the same advan∣tages. It is in the spirit of this intention, and to fulfil these views, that his said Majesty having named and ap∣pointed for his Plenipotentiary, Conrod Alexander Ger∣ard, royal syndic of the city of Strasbourg, secretary of his Majesty's council of state—and the United States on their part, having fully empowered Benjamin Franklin, deputy from the state of Pennsylvania to the general
<PB N="4" REF="033045_0003_0FF62F4DB9D7B188"/>
Congress, and president to the convention of said state— Silas Deane, late deputy from the state of Connecticut, to the said Congress—and Arthur Lee, counsellor at law: the said respective plenipotentiaries, after exchanging their powers, and after mature deliberation, have concluded and agreed upon the following articles:</P>
<P>ART. I. THERE shall be a firm, inviolable, and universal peace, and a true and sincere friendship, between the Most Christian King, his heirs and successors, and the United States of America, and the subjects of the Most Christian King, and of the said states, and between the countries, islands, cities, and towns, situate under the ju∣risdiction of the Most Christian King, and of the said United States, and the people and inhabitants of every degree, without exception of persons or places, and the terms herein after mentioned, shall be perpetual between the Most Christian King, his heirs, and successors, and the said United States.</P>
<P N="2">II. The Most Christian King, and the United States, engage mutually not to grant any particular favour to other nations, in respect of commerce and navigation, which shall not immediately become common to the other party, who shall enjoy the same favour freely, if the con∣cession was freely made—or on allowing the same com∣pensation, if the concession was conditional.</P>
<P N="3">III. The subjects of the Most Christian King, shall pay in the ports, havens, roads, countries, islands, cities, or towns of the United States, or any of them, no other or greater duties or imposts, of what nature soever they may be, or by what name soever called, than those which the nations most favoured are or shall be obliged to pay: and they shall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities, and exemptions in trade, navigation, and commerce, whether in passing from one port in the said states to another, or in going to and from the same, from and to any part of the world, which the said nations do or shall enjoy.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The subjects, people, and inhabitants of the said United States, and each of them, shall not pay in the ports, havens, roads, isles, cities, and places, under the domination of his Most Christian Majesty in Europe, any other or greater duties or imposts, of what nature soever
<PB N="5" REF="033045_0004_0FF62F4FB238B850"/>
they may be, or by what name soever called, than those which the most favoured nations are or shall be obliged to pay: and they shall enjoy all the rights, liberties, pri∣vileges, immunities, and exemptions in trade, navigation, and commerce, whether in passing from one port in the said dominions in Europe, to another, or in going to and from the same, from and to any part of the world, which the said nations do or shall enjoy.</P>
<P N="5">V. In the above exemption is particularly comprised the imposition of one hundred sols per ton, established in France on foreign ships, unless when the ships of the Uni∣ted States shall load with the merchandize of France, for another port of the same dominion: in which case, the said ships shall pay the duty above mentioned, so long as other nations the most favoured shall be obliged to pay it: but it is understood, that the said United States, or any of them, are at liberty, when they shall judge it proper, to establish a duty equivalent in the same case.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The Most Christian King shall endeavour, by all the means in his power, to protect and defend all vessels, and the effects, belonging to the subjects, people, or in∣habitants of the said United States, or any of them, be∣ing in his ports, havens, or roads, or on the seas near to his countries, islands, cities, or towns; and to recover and restore to the right owners, their agents, or attornies, all such vessels and effects, which shall be taken within his jurisdiction: and the ships of war of his Most Christian Majesty, or any convoy sailing under his authority, shall upon all occasions, take under their protection, all vessels belonging to the subjects, people, or inhabitants of the said United States, or any of them, and holding the same course, or going the same way, and shall defend such ves∣sels as long as they hold the same course, or go the same way, against all attacks, force, and violence, in the same manner as they ought to protect and defend the vessels belonging to the subjects of the Most Christian King.</P>
<P N="7">VII. In like manner the said United States, and their ships of war sailing under their authority, shall pro∣tect and defend, conformably to the tenor of the preced∣ing article, all the vessels and effects belonging to the sub∣jects of the Most Christian King, and use all their en∣deavours to recover, and cause to be restored, the said
<PB N="6" REF="033045_0005_0FF62F51B3858B70"/>
vessels and effects that shall have been taken within the jurisdiction of the said United States, or any of them.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The Most Christian King will employ his good offices and interposition with the King or Emperor of Morocco or Fez—the Regencies of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, or with any of them—and also with every other prince, state, or power, of the coast of Barbary in Africa —and the subjects of the said king, emperor, states, and powers, and each of them, in order to provide, as fully and efficaciously as possible, for the benefit, conveniency, and safety of the United States, and each of them, their subjects, people, and inhabitants, and their vessels and ef∣fects, against all violence, insult, attacks, or depredations, on the part of the said princes and states of Barbary, or their subjects.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The subjects, inhabitants, merchants, command∣ers of ships, masters, and mariners of the states, provinces, and dominions of each respectively, shall abstain and for∣bear to fish in all places possessed, or which shall be pos∣sessed by the other party. The Most Christian King's subjects shall not fish in the havens, bays, creeks, roads, coasts, or places, which the said United States hold, or shall hereafter hold: and in like manner, the subjects, people, and inhabitants of the said United States, shall not fish in the havens, bays, creeks, roads, coasts, or places, which the most Christian King possesses, or shall hereafter possess: and if any ship or vessel shall be found fishing, contrary to the tenor of this treaty, the said ship or vessel with its lading (proof being made thereof) shall be con∣fiscated: it is, however, understood that the exclusion stipulated in the present article, shall take place only so long and so far, as the Most Christian King or the Uni∣ted States shall not, in this respect, have granted an ex∣emption to some other nation.</P>
<P N="10">X. The United States, their citizens and inhabitants, shall never disturb the subjects of the Most Christian King, in the enjoyment and exercise of the right of fishing on the banks of Newfoundland—nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the indefinite and exclusive right which belongs to them on that part of the coast of that island, which is designed by the treaty of Utrecht—nor in the rights relative to all and each of the isles, which belong to his Most Christian Majesty, the
<PB N="7" REF="033045_0006_0FF62F53DA0B8AA0"/>
whole conformable to the true sense of the treaties of Utrecht and Paris.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The subjects and inhabitants of the said United States, or any of them, shall not be reputed aubains in France; and consequently shall be exempted from the <HI>droit d'aubaine,</HI> or other similar duty, under what name soever. They may, by testament, donation, or otherwise, dispose of their goods, moveable and immoveable, in fav∣our of such persons as to them shall seem good; and their heirs, subjects of the said United States, residing whether in France or elsewhere, may succeed them, <HI>ab intestat,</HI> without being obliged to obtain letters of naturalization, and without having the effect of this concession contested or impeded, under pretext of any rights or prerogatives of provinces, cities, or private persons. And the said heirs, whether such by particular title, or <HI>ab intestat,</HI> shall be exempt from all duty called <HI>droit de detraction,</HI> or other duty of the same kind; saving nevertheless the lo∣cal rights or duties, as much and as long as similar ones are not established by the United States, or any of them. The subjects of the Most Christian King shall enjoy on their part, in all the dominions of the said States, an en∣tire and perfect reciprocity, relative to the stipulations contained in the present article: but it is at the same time agreed, that its contents shall not affect the laws made, or that may be made hereafter in France, against emigrations, which shall remain in all their force and vig∣our: and the United States on their part, or any of them, shall be at liberty to enact such laws, relative to that matter, as to them shall seem proper.</P>
<P N="12">XII. The merchant-ships of either of the parties, which shall be making into a port belonging to the enemy of the other ally, and concerning whose voyage, and the spe∣cies of goods on board her, there shall be just grounds of suspicion, shall be obliged to exhibit, as well upon the high seas, as in the ports and havens, not only her pass∣ports, but likewise certificates, expressly shewing that her goods are not of the number of those which have been prohibited as contraband.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. If, by the exhibiting of the above-said certificates, the other party discover there are any of those sorts of goods which are prohibited and declared contraband, and
<PB N="8" REF="033045_0007_0FF62F56348F69F0"/>
consigned for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> port under the obedience of its enemies, it shall not be lawful to break up the hatches of such ship, or to open any chests, coffers, packs, casks, or any other vessele found therein, or to remove the smallest parcels of her goods, whether such ship belongs to the subjects of France, or the inhabitants of the said United States, un∣less the lading be brought on shore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the presence of the officers of the court of admiralty, and an inventory thereof made: but there shall be no allowance to sell, exchange, or alienate the same in any manner, until after that due and lawful process shall have been had against such pro∣hibited goods, and the court of admiralty shall, by a sen∣tence pronounced, have confiscated the same; saving al∣ways as well the ship itself, as any other goods found therein, which by this Treaty are to be esteemed free: neither may they be detained on pretence of their being as it were infected by the prohibited goods; much less shall they be confiscated as lawful prize; but if not the whole cargo, but only part thereof shall consist of pro∣hibited or contraband goods, and the commander of the ship shall be ready and willing to deliver them to the cap∣tor, who has discovered them, in such case the captor having received those goods, shall forthwith discharge the ship, and not hinder her by any means freely to prose∣cute the voyage on which she was bound: but in case the contraband merchandizes cannot be all received on board the vessel of the captor, then the captor may, not∣withstanding the offer of delivering him the contraband goods, carry the vessel into the nearest port, agreeable to what is above directed.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. On the contrary, it is agreed, that whatever shall be found to be laden by the subjects and inhabitants of either party on any ship belonging to the enemies of the other, or to their subjects, the whole, although it be not of the sort of prohibited goods, may be confiscated in the same manner as if it belonged to the enemy, ex∣cept such goods and merchandizes as were put on board such ship before the declaration of war, or even after such declaration if so be it were done without knowledge of such declaration: so that the goods of the subjects and people of either party, whether they be of the nature of such as are prohibited or otherwise, which, as is afore∣said,
<PB REF="033045_0008_0FF62F57C9578678"/>
said, were put on board any ship belonging to an enemy before the war, or after the declaration of the same, with∣out the knowledge of it, shall no ways be liable to con∣fiscation, but shall well and truly be restored without de∣lay to the proprietors demanding the same; but so as that if the said merchandizes be contraband, it shall not be any-ways lawful to carry them afterwards to any ports belonging to the enemy. The two contracting parties agree, that the term of two months being passed after the declaration of war, their respective subjects, from what∣ever part of the world they come, shall not plead the ig∣norance mentioned in this article.</P>
<P N="15">XV. And that more effectual care may be taken for the security of the subjects and inhabitants of both par∣ties, that they suffer no injury by the men of war or pri∣vateers of the other party, all the commanders of the ships of his Most Christian Majesty and of the said United States, and all their subjects and inhabitants, shall be for∣bidden doing any injury or damage to the other side; and if they act to the contrary, they shall be punished: and shall moreover be bound to make satisfaction for all matter of damage, and the interest thereof, by reparation, under the pain and obligation of their person and goods.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. All ships and merchandizes, of what nature soever, which shall be rescued out of the hands of any pi∣rates or robbers on the high seas, shall be brought into some port of either state, and shall be delivered to the custody of the officers of that port, in order to be restored entire to the true proprietor, as soon as due and sufficient proof shall be made concerning the property thereof.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. It shall be lawful for the ships of war of either party, and privateers, freely to carry, whitherso∣ever they please, the ships and goods taken from their enemies, without being obliged to pay any duty to the officers of the admiralty, or any other judges: nor shall such prizes be arrested or seized, when they come to, and enter the ports of either party: nor shall the searchers or other officers of those places search the same, or make examination concerning the lawfulness of the prizes: but they may hoist sail at any time, and depart, and carry their prizes to the places expressed in their commissions, which the commanders of such ships of war shall be
<PB N="10" REF="033045_0009_0FF62F59647298D0"/>
obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: on the contrary, no shelter or refuge shall be given in their ports to such as shall have made prize of the subjects, people, or property of either of the parties; but if such shall come in, being forced by stress of weather, or the danger of the sea, all proper means shall be vigorously used, that they go out and retire from thence as soon as possible.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. If any ship, belonging to either of the par∣ties, their people, or subjects, shall, within the coasts or dominions of the other, stick upon the sands, or be wrecked, or suffer any other damage—all friendly assist∣ance and relief shall be given to the persons ship-wrecked, or such as shall be in danger thereof. And letters of safe-conduct shall likewise be given to them, for their free and quiet passage from thence, and the return of every one to his own country.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. In case the subjects and inhabitants of either party, with their shipping, whether public and of war, or private and of merchants, be forced through stress of weather, pursuit of pirates, or enemies, or any other ur∣gent necessity for seeking of shelter and harbour, to re∣treat and enter into any of the rivers, bays, roads, or ports belonging to the other party, they shall be received and treated with all humanity and kindness, and enjoy all friendly protection and help: and they shall be per∣mitted to refresh and provide themselves, at reasonable rates, with victuals, and all things needful for the suste∣nance of their persons, or reparation of their ships, and conveniency of their voyage: and they shall no ways be detained or hindered from returning out of the said ports or roads, but may remove and depart, when, and whither they please, without any let or hindrance.</P>
<P N="20">XX. For the better promoting of commerce on both sides, it is agreed, that if a war shall break out between the said two nations, six months after the proclamation of war, shall be allowed to the merchants, in the cities and towns where they live, for selling and transporting their goods and merchandizes: and, if any thing be tak∣en from them, or any injury be done them within that term, by either party, or the people or subjects of either, full satisfaction shall be made for the same.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. No subjects of the Most Christian King shall
<PB N="11" REF="033045_0010_0FF62F5AEF87A5F8"/>
apply for, or take any commission or letters of marque, for arming any ship or ships to act as privateers against the said United States, or any of them, or against the subjects, people, or inhabitants of the said United States, or any of them, or against the property of any of the in∣habitants of any of them, from any prince or state with which the said United States shall be at war: nor shall any citizen, subject, or inhabitant of the said United States, or any of them, apply for, or take any commis∣sion or letters of marque, for arming any ship or ships, to act as privateers against the subjects of the Most Chris∣tian King, or any of them, or the property of any of them, from any prince or state with which the said king shall be at war: and if any person of either nation shall take such commissions or letters of marque, he shall be punished as a pirate.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. It shall not be lawful for any foreign priva∣teers, not belonging to subjects of the Most Christian King, nor citizens of the said United States, who have commissions from any other prince or state in enmity with either nation, to fit their ships in the ports of either the one or the other of the aforesaid parties, to sell what they have taken, or in any other manner whatsoever, to ex∣change their ships, merchandizes, or any other lading: neither shall they be allowed even to purchase victuals, except such as shall be necessary for their going to the next port of that prince or state from which they have commissions.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. It shall be lawful for all and singular the subjects of the Most Christian King, and the citizens, people, and inhabitants of the said United States, to sail with their ships with all manner of liberty and security, no distinction being made who are the proprietors of the merchandizes laden thereon, from any port, to the pla∣ces of those who now are or hereafter shall be at enmity with the Most Christian King or the United States. It shall likewise be lawful for the subjects and inhabitants aforesaid, to sail with the ships and merchandizes afore∣mentioned, and to trade with the same liberty and secu∣rity from the places, ports and havens of those who are enemies of both or either party, without any opposition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> disturbance whatsoever, not only directly from the
<PB N="12" REF="033045_0011_0FF62F5D9D466280"/>
places of the enemy aforementioned, to neutral places; but also from one place belonging to an enemy, to another place belonging to an enemy, whether they be under the jurisdiction of the same prince, or under several. And it is hereby stipulated, that free ships shall also give a freedom to goods; and that every thing shall be deem∣ed to be free and exempt, which shall be found on board the ships belonging to the subjects of either of the con∣federates, although the whole lading or any part thereof should appertain to the enemies of either, contraband goods being always excepted. It is also agreed in like manner, that the same liberty be extended to persons who are on board a free ship, with this effect, that although they be enemies to both or either party, they are not to be taken out of that free ship, unless they are soldiers and in actual service of the enemy.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. This liberty of navigation and commerce shall extend to all kinds of merchandizes, excepting those only which are distinguished by the name of contraband, and under this name of contraband or prohibited goods shall be comprehended arms, great guns, bombs, with the fusees and other things belonging to them, cannon-ball, gun-powder, match, pikes, swords, lances, spears, halberds, mortars, petards, grenades, saltpetre, muskets, musket ball, bucklers, helmets, breast-plates, coats of mail, and the like kinds of arms, proper for arming sol∣diers, musket-rests, belts, horses with their furniture, and all other warlike instruments whatever. These merchan∣dizes that follow, shall not be reckoned among contra∣band or prohibited goods; that is to say, all sorts of cloths, and all other manufactures woven of any wool, flax, silk, cotton, or any other materials whatever; all kinds of wearing apparel, together with the species where∣of they are used to be made; gold and silver, as well coined as uncoined, tin, iron, latten, copper, brass, coals; as also wheat and barley, and any other kind of corn, and pulse, tobacco, and likewise all manner of spices, salted and smoaked flesh, salted fish, cheese and butter, beer, oils, wines, sugars, and all sorts of salts, and in general all provisions which serve for the nourishment of man∣kind and the sustenance of life; furthermore, all kinds of cotton, hemp, flax, tar, pitch, ropes, cables, sails, sail-cloths,
<PB N="13" REF="033045_0012_0FF62F5F2CBF5668"/>
anchors, and any parts of anchor, also ships, masts, planks, boards, and beams of what trees soever: and all other things proper either for building or repairing ships, and all other goods whatever which have not been work∣ed into the form of any instrument or thing prepared for war by land or by sea, shall not be reputed contraband, much less such as have been already wrought and made up for any other use; all which shall be wholly reckon∣ed among free goods; as likewise all other merchandises and things which are not comprehended and particularly mentioned in the foregoing enumeration of contraband goods, so that they may be transported and carried in the freest manner by the subjects of both confederates, even to places belonging to an enemy—such towns or places being only excepted, as are at that time besieged, blocked up, or invested.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. To the end that all manner of dissentions and quarrels may be avoided and prevented, on one side and the other, it is agreed, that in case either of the parties hereto should be engaged in war, the ships and vessels be∣longing to the subjects or people of the other ally, must be furnished with sea letters or passports, expressing the name, property, and bulk of the ship, as also the name and place of habitation of the commander of the said ship, that it may appear thereby that the ship really and truly belongs to the subjects of one of the parties, which passport shall be made out and granted according to the form annexed to this treaty. They shall likewise be re∣called every year, that is, if the ship happens to return home within the space of a year; it is likewise agreed, that such ships, being laden, are to be provided not only with passports as above mentioned, but also with certifi∣cates, containing the several particulars of the cargo, the place whence the ship sailed, and whither she is bound; that so it may be known whether any forbidden or con∣traband goods be on board the same; which certificates shall be made out by the officers of the place whence the ship set sail, in the accustomed form: and if any one shall think it fit or adviseable to express in the said certificates the person to whom the goods on board belong, he may freely do so.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. The ships of the subjects and inhabitants of
<PB N="14" REF="033045_0013_0FF62F60E391BA68"/>
either of the parties coming upon any coasts belonging to either of the said allies, but not willing to enter into port, or being entered into port, and not willing to unload their cargoes or break bulk, they shall be treated accord∣ing to the general rules prescribed or to be prescribed re∣lative to the object in question.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. If the ships of the said subjects, people, or inhabitants of either of the parties, shall be met with, either sailing along the coasts, or on the high seas, by any ships of war of the other, or by any privateers, the said ships of war or privateers for the avoiding of any dis∣order, shall remain out of cannon shot, and may send their boats on board the merchant ship, which they shall so meet with; and may enter her to the number of two or three men only: to whom the master or commander of such ship or vessel shall exhibit his passport, concerning the property of the ship, made out according to the form inserted in this present Treaty: and the ship, when she shall have shewed such passport, shall be free and at liberty to pursue her voyage, so as it shall not be lawful to mo∣lest or search her in any manner, or to give her chase, or force her to quit her intended course.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. It is also agreed, that all goods, when once put on board the ships or vessels of either of the two contracting parties, shall be subject to no further visita∣tion; but all visitation or search shall be made before∣hand; and all prohibited goods shall be stopped on the spot before the same be put on board, unless there be manifest tokens or proofs of fraudulent practice: nor shall either the persons or goods of the subjects of his Most Christian Majesty, or the United States, be put un∣der any arrest, or molested by any other kind of embar∣go for that cause: and only the subject of that state to whom the said goods have been or shall be prohibited, and who shall presume to sell or alienate such sort of goods, shall be duly punished for the offence.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. The two contracting parties grant mutually the liberty of having each in the ports of the other, con∣suls, vice-consuls, agents and commissaries, whose func∣tions shall be regulated by a particular agreement.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. And the more to favour and facilitate the commerce which the subjects of the United States may
<PB N="15" REF="033045_0014_0FF62F62D1B8BE40"/>
have with France, the Most Christian King will grant them in Europe, one or more free ports, where they may bring and dispose of all the produce and merchandise of the thirteen United States: and his Majesty will also con∣tinue to the subjects of the said States, the free ports which have been and are open in the French islands of America; of all which free ports the said subjects of the United States shall enjoy the use, agreeably to the regu∣lations which relate to them.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. The present Treaty shall be ratified on both sides, and the ratifications shall be exchanged in the space of six months, or sooner, if possible.</P>
<P>In faith whereof the respective plenipotentiarics have sign∣ed the above articles, both in the French and English languages; declaring nevertheless, that the present Treaty was originally composed and concluded in the French language; and they have hereto affixed their seals.</P>

<P>THE Most Christian King, and the United States of North-America, to wit, New-Hampshire, Massa∣chusetts-bay, Rhode-Island, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, having this day concluded a Treaty of Amity and Commerce, for the reciprocal advantage of their subjects and citizens, have thought it necessary to take into consideration the means of strengthening those engagements, and of render∣ing them useful to the safety and tranquillity of the two parties; particularly in case Great-Britain, in resentment of that connexion, and of the good correspondence which is the object of the said treaty, should break the peace with France, either by direct hostilities, or by hindering her commerce and navigation in a manner contrary to the rights of nations, and the peace subsisting between the two crowns. And his Majesty and the said United States, having resolved in that case, to join their councils and efforts against the enterprises of their common enemy—</P>
<P>The respective Plenipotentiaries, empowered to concert the clauses and conditions proper to fulfil the said inten∣tions, have, after the most mature deliberation, concluded and determined on the following articles.</P>
<P N="1">I. If war should break out between France and Great-Britain, during the continuance of the present war be∣tween the United States and England, his Majesty and the said United States shall make it a common cause, and aid each other mutually with their good offices, their counsels, and their forces, according to the exigence of conjunctures, as becomes good and faithful allies.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="17" REF="033045_0016_0FF62F66AE560B98"/>II. The essential and direct end of the present defen∣sive alliance is, to maintain effectually the liberty, sover∣eignty, and independence, absolute and unlimited, of the said United States, as well in matters of government, as of commerce.</P>
<P N="3">III. The two contracting parties shall, each on its own part, and in the manner it may judge most proper, make all the efforts in its power against their common enemy, in order to attain the end proposed.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The contracting parties agree, that in case either of them should form any particular enterprise, in which the concurrence of the other may be desired, the party, whose concurrence is desired, shall readily and with good faith join to act in concert for that purpose, as far as cir∣cumstances and its own particular situation will permit. And in that case, they shall regulate by a particular con∣vention, the quantity and kind of succour to be furnished, and the time and manner of its being brought into action, as well as the advantages which are to be its com∣pensation.</P>
<P N="5">V. If the United States should think fit to attempt the reduction of the British power, remaining in the north∣ern parts of America, or the islands of Bermudas, those countries or islands, in case of success, shall be confede∣rated with, or dependent upon the said United States.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The Most Christian King renounces forever, the possession of the islands of Bermudas, as well as of any part of the continent of North-America, which before the Treaty of Paris, in 1763, or in virtue of that Treaty, were acknowledged to belong to the crown of Great-Britain, or to the United States, heretofore called British colonies, or which are at this time, or have lately been under the power of the king and crown of Great-Britain.</P>
<P N="7">VII. If his Most Christian Majesty shall think proper to attack any of the islands situated in the gulf of Mexico, or near that gulf, which are at present under the power of Great-Britain, all the said isles, in case of success, shall appertain to the crown of France.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Neither of the two parties shall conclude either trace or peace with Great-Britain, without the formal consent of the other first obtained: and they mutually engage not to lay down their arms, until the independ∣ence
<PB N="18" REF="033045_0017_0FF62F43781D3FE8"/>
of the United States shall have been formally or tacitly assured, by the treaty or treaties that shall termin∣ate the war.</P>
<P N="9">IX. The contracting parties declare, that being re∣solved to fulfil each on its own part, the clauses and con∣ditions of the present Treaty of Alliance, according to its own power and circumstances, there shall be no after-claim of compensation, on one side or the other, whatever may be the event of the war.</P>
<P N="10">X. The Most Christian King and the United States, agree to invite or admit other powers, who may have received injuries from England, to make a common cause with them, and to accede to the present alliance, under such conditions as shall be freely agreed to, and settled between all the parties.</P>
<P N="11">XI. The two parties guarantee mutually from the present time and forever, against all other powers, to wit, the United States to his Most Christian Majesty, the pres∣ent possessions of the crown of France in America, as well as those which it may acquire by the future Treaty of Peace: and his Most Christian Majesty guarantees on his part to the United States, their liberty, sovereignty, and independence, absolute and unlimited, as well in matters of government, as commerce—and also their possessions, and the additions or conquests that their con∣federation may obtain during the war, from any of the dominions now or heretofore possessed by Great-Britain in North-America, conformable to the fifth and sixth articles above-written; the whole, as their possessions, shall be fixed and assured to the said states, at the moment of the cessation of their present war with England.</P>
<P N="12">XII. In order to fix more precisely the sense and ap∣plication of the preceding article, the contracting parties declare, that in case of a rupture between France and England, the reciprocal guarantee declared in the said article, shall have its full force and effect, the moment such war shall break out: and if such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall not take place, the mutual obligations of the said guarantee shall not commence until the momen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>tion of the present war, between the United State<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and England, shall have ascertained their possession.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. The present Treaty shall be ratified on both
<PB N="19" REF="033045_0018_0FF62F6BE14EB008"/>
sides, and the ratification shall be exchanged in the space of six months, or sooner, if possible.</P>
<P>In faith whereof the respective Plenipotentiaries, to wit, on the part of the Most Christian King, Conrad Alexan∣der Gerard, royal syndic of the city of Strasbourg, and secretary of his Majesty's council of state—and on the part of the United States, Benjamin Franklin, deputy to the general Congress from the state of Pennsylvania, and president of the Convention of said state—Silas Deane, heretofore deputy from the state of Connecticut—and Arthur Lee, counsellor at law, have signed the above articles both in the French and English languages; de∣claring, nevertheless, that the present Treaty was origin∣ally composed and concluded in the French language; and they have hereunto affixed their seals.</P>

<P>HIS Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, being desirous, by a Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, to terminate their differences in such a manner, as, without reference to the merits of their respective complaints and pretensions, may be the best calculated to produce mutual satisfaction and good understanding: and also to regulate the Commerce and Navigation between their respective countries, territories and people, in such a manner as to render the same re∣ciprocally beneficial and satisfactory; they have, respec∣tively, named their Plenipotentiaries, and given them full power to treat of, and conclude, the said Treaty, that is to say: his Britannic Majesty has named for his Plenipo∣tentiary, the Right Honorable William Windham, Baron Grenville, of Wotton, one of his Majesty's Privy Coun∣cil, and his Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Fo∣reign Affairs; and the President of the said United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, hath appointed for their Plenipotentiary, the Honorable John Jay, Chief Justice of the said United States, and their Envoy Extraordinary to his Majesty, who have agreed and concluded the following articles:</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE II.</HEAD>
<P>His Majesty will withdraw all his troops and garrisons from all posts and places within the boundary lines as∣signed by the Treaty of Peace to the United States. This evacuation shall take place on or before the first day of June, one thousand seven hundred and ninety-six, and all the proper measures shall, in the interval, be taken by concert between the government of the United States, and his Majesty's Governor General in America, for settling the previous arrangements, which may be necessary re∣specting the delivery of the said posts: The United States, in the mean time, at their discretion, extending their settlements to any part within the said boun∣dary line, except within the precincts or jurisdiction of any of the said posts. All settlers and traders within the precincts or jurisdiction of the said posts, shall continue to enjoy, unmolested, all their property of every kind, and shall be protected therein. They shall be at full lib∣erty to remain there, or to remove with all or any part of their effects; and it shall also be free to them to sell their lands, houses, or effects, or to retain the property thereof, at their discretion; such of them as shall continue to reside within the said boundary lines, shall not be com∣pelled to become citizens of the United States, or to take any oath of allegiance to the government thereof; but shall be at full liberty so to do if they think proper; and they shall make and declare their election within one year after the evacuation aforesaid. And all persons who shall continue there after the expiration of the said year, with∣out having declared their intention of remaining subjects of his Britannic Majesty, shall be considered as having elected to become citizens of the United States.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE III.</HEAD>
<P>It is agreed, that it shall, at all times, be free to his Majesty's subjects, and to the citizens of the United States, and also to the Indians dwelling on either side of the said boundary line, freely to pass and repass by land or inland navigation, into the respective territories and countries of the two parties, on the continent of America (the country within the limits of the Hudson's bay company only ex∣cepted) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers, and water<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thereof, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with
<PB N="27" REF="033045_0026_0FF62F7ACCE56FF8"/>
each other. But it is understood, that this article does not extend to the admission of vessels of the United States into the sea-ports, harbors, bays, or creeks of his Majesty's said territories; nor into such parts of the rivers in his Majesty's said territories as are between the mouth there∣of, and the highest port of entry from the sea, except in small vessels trading <HI>bona fide</HI> between Montreal and Que∣bec, under such regulations as shall be established to pre∣vent the possibility of any frauds in this respect; nor to the admission of British vessels from the sea into the rivers of the United States, beyond the highest ports of entry for vessels from the sea. The river Missisippi shall, how∣ever, according to the Treaty of Peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its eastern side, to whichsoever of the parties belonging, may freely be resorted to, and used by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the Atlantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his Majesty in Great-Britain.</P>
<P>All goods and merchandize, whose importation into his Majesty's said territories in America shall not be en∣tirely prohibited, may freely, for the purposes of com∣merce, be carried into the same in the manner aforesaid, by the citizens of the United States, and such goods and merchandize shall be subject to no higher or other duties, than would be payable by his Majesty's subjects on the importation of the same from Europe into the said terri∣tories. And in like manner, all goods and merchandize, whose importation into the United States shall not be wholly prohibited, may freely, for the purposes of com∣merce, be carried into the same, in the manner aforesaid, by his Majesty's subjects, and such goods and merchan∣dize shall be subject to no higher or other duties, than would be payable by the citizens of the United States on the importation of the same in American vessels into the Atlantic ports of the said States. And all goods not prohibited to be exported from the said territories respec∣tively, may, in like manner, be carried out of the same by the two parties respectively, paying duty as aforesaid.</P>
<P>No duty of entry shall ever be levied by either party on peltries brought by land, or inland navigation, into the said territories respectively; nor shall the Indians
<PB N="28" REF="033045_0027_0FF62F7D2A149540"/>
passing or repassing with their own proper goods and ef∣fects, of whatever nature, pay for the same any impost or duty whatever. But goods in bales, or other large pack∣ages, unusual among Indians, shall not be considered as goods belonging <HI>bona fide</HI> to Indians.</P>
<P>No higher or other tolls or rates of ferriage than what are or shall be payable by natives, shall be demanded on either side; and no duties shall be payable on any goods which shall be merely carried over any of the portages or carrying places on either side, for the purpose of being immediately reimbarked and carried to some other place or places. But as by this stipulation it is only meant to secure to each party a free passage across the portages on both sides; it is agreed, that this exemption from duty shall extend only to such goods as are carried in the usual and direct road across the portage, and are not attempted to be in any manner sold or exchanged during their passage across the same; and proper regulations may be establish∣ed to prevent the possibility of any frauds in this respect.</P>
<P>As this article is intended to render in a great degree the local advantages of each party common to both, and thereby to promote a disposition favorable to friendship and good neighborhood, it is agreed, that the respective gov∣ernments will mutually promote this amicable intercourse, by causing speedy and impartial justice to be done, and necessary protection to be extended to all who may be concerned therein.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE IV.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas it is uncertain whether the river Missisippi extends so far to the northward as to be intersected by a line to be drawn due west from the Lake of the Woods, in the manner mentioned in the Treaty of Peace between his Majesty and the United States: it is agreed, that measures shall be taken in concert between his Majesty's government in America and the government of the Unit∣ed States, for making a joint survey of the said river from one degree of latitude below the falls of St. Anthony, to the principal source or sources of said river, and the parts adjacent thereto; and that if on the result of such survey, it should appear that the said river would not be inter∣sected by such a line as is above mentioned, the two par∣ties will thereupon proceed by amicable negociation, to
<PB N="29" REF="033045_0028_0FF62F7F1DEA7668"/>
regulate the boundary line in that quarter, as well as all other points to be adjusted between the said parties, ac∣cording to justice and mutual convenience, and in con∣formity to the intent of the said Treaty.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE V.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas doubts have arisen what river was truly in∣tended under the name of the river St. Croix, mentioned in the said Treaty of Peace, and forming a part of the boundary therein described; that question shall be refer∣red to the final decision of Commissioners to be appoint∣ed in the following manner, viz.</P>
<P>One Commissioner shall be named by his Majesty, and one by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and the said two Commissioners shall agree on the choice of a third; or if they cannot so agree, they shall each propose one person, and of the two names so proposed, one shall be drawn by lot in the presence of the two original Com∣missioners. And the three Commissioners so appointed, shall be sworn, impartially to examine and decide the said question, according to such evidence as shall respec∣tively be laid before them on the part of the British gov∣ernment and of the United States. The said Commission∣ers shall meet at Halisax, and shall have power to adjourn to such other place or places as they shall think fit. They shall have power to appoint a Secretary, and to employ such Surveyors or other persons as they shall judge neces∣sary. The said Commissioners shall, by a declaration under their hands and seals, decide what river is the river St. Croix intended by the Treaty. The said declaration shall contain a description of the said river, and shall par∣ticularize the latitude and longitude of its mouth and of its source. Duplicates of this declaration and of the state∣ments of their accounts, and of the journal of their pro∣ceedings, shall be delivered by them to the agent of his Majesty, and to the agent of the United States, who may be respectively appointed and authorized to manage the business on behalf of the respective governments. And both parties agree to consider such decision as final and conclusive, so as that the same shall never thereafter be called in question, or made the subject of dispute or differ∣ence between them.</P>

<HEAD>ARTICLE VI.</HEAD>
<P>Whereas it is alledged by divers British merchants and others his Majesty's subjects, that debts to a considerable amount, which were <HI>bona fide</HI> contracted before the peace, still remain owing to them by citizens or inhabitants of the United States; and that by the operation of various lawful impediments since the peace, not only the full re∣covery of the said debts has been delayed, but also the value and security thereof have been, in several instances, impaired and lessened, so that by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the British creditors cannot now ob∣tain, and actually have and receive full and adequate com∣pensation for the losses and damages which they have thereby sustained. It is agreed, that in all such cases, where full compensation for such losses and damages can∣not, for whatever reason, be actually obtained, had and received by the said creditors in the ordinary course of justice, the United States will make full and complete compensation for the same to the said creditors; but it is distinctly understood, that this provision is to extend to such losses only as have been occasioned by the lawful impediments aforesaid, and is not to extend to losses oc∣casioned by such insolvency of the debtors, or other causes as would equally have operated to produce such a loss, if the same impediments had not existed: nor to such losses or damages as have been occasioned by the manifest delay or negligence, or wilful omission of the claimant.</P>
<P>For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of any such losses or damages, five Commissioners shall be appointed, and authorized to meet and act in manner following, viz. two of them shall be appointed by his Majesty, two of them by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and the fifth by the unanimous voice of the other four; and if they should not agree in such choice, then the Commissioners named by the two parties shall respectively propose one person, and of the two names so proposed, one shall be drawn by lot, in the presence of the four original Com∣missioners. When the five Commissioners thus appointed shall first meet, they shall, before they proceed to act, re∣spectively take the following oath or affirmation, in the presence of each other, which oath or affirmation, being
<PB N="31" REF="033045_0030_0FF62F835E9744B0"/>
so taken and duly attested, shall be entered on the record of their proceedings, viz.
<Q>I <HI>A. B.</HI> one of the Com∣missioners appointed in pursuance of the sixth article of the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, be∣tween his Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, do solemnly swear, <HI>or affirm,</HI> that I will hon∣estly, diligently, impartially, and carefully examine, and to the best of my judgment, according to justice and equity, decide all such complaints, as, under the the said article, shall be preferred to the said Commis∣sioners: and that I will forbear to act as a Commis∣sioner, in any case in which I may be personally inter∣ested.</Q></P>
<P>Three of the said Commissioners shall constitute a board, and shall have power to do any act appertaining to the said commission, provided that one of the Com∣missioners named on each side, and the fifth Commission∣er, shall be present, and all decisions shall be made by the majority of the voices of the Commissioners then pre∣sent. Eighteen months from the day on which the said Commissioners shall form a board, and be ready to pro∣ceed to business, are assigned for receiving complaints and applications; but they are nevertheless authorised in any particular cases in which it shall appear to them to be reasonable and just, to extend the same term of eigh∣teen months for any term not exceeding six months, after the expiration thereof. The said Commissioners shall first meet at Philadelphia, but they shall have power to adjourn from place to place as they shall see cause.</P>
<P>The said Commissioners in examining the complaints and applications so preferred to them, are empowered and required, in pursuance of the true intent and meaning of this article, to take into their consideration all claims, whether of principal or interest, and balances of principal or interest, to determine the same respectively, according to the merits of the several cases, due regard being had to all the circumstances thereof, and as equity and jus∣tice shall appear to them to require. And the said Com∣missioners shall have power to examine all such persons as shall come before them, on oath or affirmation, touch∣ing the premises; and also to receive in evidence, accord∣ing as they may think most consistent with equity and
<PB N="32" REF="033045_0031_0FF62F854976DDE8"/>
justice, all written depositions, or books, or papers, or copies or extracts thereof, every such deposition, book, or paper, or extract, being duly authenticated, either ac∣cording to the legal forms now respectively existing in the two countries, or in such other manner as the said Com∣missioners shall see cause to require or allow.</P>
<P>The award of the said Commissioners or of any three of them as aforesaid, shall in all cases be final and con∣clusive, both as to the justice of the claim, and to the amount of the sum to be paid to the creditor or claimant: and the United States undertake to cause the sum so awarded to be paid in specie to such creditor or claimant without deduction; and at such time or times, and at such place or places as shall be awarded by the said Commissioners; and on condition of such releases or assignments to be given by the creditor or claimant, as by the said Commissioners may be directed: Provided always, that no such payment shall be fixed by the said Commissioners to take place sooner than twelve months from the day of exchange of the ratification of this Treaty.</P>

<P>Whereas complaints have been made by divers mer∣chants and others, citizens of the United States, that during the course of the war in which his Majesty is now engaged, they have sustained considerable losses and damage, by reason of irregular or illegal captures or con∣demnations of their vessels and other property, under co∣lour of authority or commissions from his Majesty; and that from various circumstances belonging to the said cases, adequate compensation for the losses and damages so sustained cannot now be actually obtained, had and received by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings; it is agreed, that in all such cases, where adequate com∣pensation cannot, for whatever reason, be now actually obtained, had and received by the said merchants and others in the ordinary course of justice, full and complete compensation for the same will be made by the British Government to the said complainants. But it is distinct∣ly understood that this provision is not to extend to such losses or damages as have been occasioned by the mani∣fest delay or negligence, or wilful omission of the claimants.</P>
<P>That for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of any
<PB N="33" REF="033045_0032_0FF62F873578B880"/>

They shall receive testimony, books, papers, and evidence in the same latitude, and ex∣ercise the like discretion and powers respecting that sub∣ject; and shall decide the claims in question according to the merits of the several cases, and to justice, equity, and the laws of nations. The award of the said Commission∣ers, or any such three of them as aforesaid, shall, in all cases, be final and conclusive, both as to the justice of the claim and the amount of the sum to be paid to the claimant; and his Britannic Majesty undertakes to cause the same to be paid to such claimant in specie, without any deduction, at such place or places, and at such time or times as shall be awarded by the said Commissioners, and on condition of such releases or assignments to be given by the claimants, as by the said Commissioners may be directed.</P>
<P>And whereas certain merchants and others his Majes∣ty's subjects complain, that in the course of the war, they have sustained loss and damage, by reason of the cap∣ture of the vessels and merchandize, taken within the limits and jurisdiction of the states, and brought into the ports of the same, or taken by vessels originally armed in ports of the said states:</P>
<P>It is agreed, that in all such cases, where restitution shall not have been made agreeably to the tenor of the letter from Mr. Jefferson to Mr. Hammond, dated at Philadelphia, Sept. 5, 1793, a copy of which is annexed to this Treaty; the complaints of the parties shall be and hereby are referred to the Commissioners to be appointed by virtue of this article, who are hereby authorized and required to proceed in the like manner relative to these as to the other cases committed to them; and the Uni∣ted States undertake to pay to the complainants or claim∣ants in specie, without deduction, the amount of such sums as shall be awarded to them respectively by the said

Commissioners, and at the times and places which in such awards shall be specified; and on condition of such re∣leases or assignments to be given by the claimants as in the said awards may be directed: And it is further agreed, that not-only the now existing cases of both de∣scriptions, but also all such as shall exist at the time of exchanging the ratifications of this Treaty, shall be con∣sidered as being within the provisions, intent, and mean∣ing of this article.</P>

<DIV2 N="12" TYPE="article">
<HEAD>ARTICLE XII.</HEAD>
<P>His Majesty consents, that it shall and may be lawful during the time herein after limited, for the citizens of the United States to carry to any of his Majesty's islands and ports in the West-Indies from the United States, in their own vessels, not being above the burthen of seventy tons, any goods or merchandises, being of the growth, manufacture or produce of the said states, which it is or may be lawful to carry to the said islands or ports from the said states in British vessels; and that the said Ameri∣can vessels shall be subject there to no other or higher tonnage duties or charges, than shall be payable by Brit∣ish vessels in the ports of the United States; and that the cargoes of the said American vessels shall be subject there to no other or higher duties or charges, than shall be payable on the like articles if imported there from the said states in British vessels.</P>
<P>And his Majesty also consents, that it shall be lawful for the said American citizens to purchase, load, and carry away in their said vessels to the United States, from the said islands and ports, all such articles, being of the growth, manufacture or produce of the said islands, as may now by law be carried from thence to the said states in British vessels, and subject only to the same duties and charges on exportation, to which British vessels and their cargoes are or shall be subject in similar circumstances.</P>
<P>Provided always, that the said American vessels do car∣ry and land their cargoes in the United States only, it being expressly agreed and declared, that during the con∣tinuance of this article, the United States will prohibit and restrain the carrying away any molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa or cotton in American vessels, either from his Ma∣jesty's

<P>It is agreed, that this article and every matter and thing therein contained, shall continue to be in force dur∣ing the continuance of the war in which his Majesty is now engaged; and also for two years from and after the day of the signature of the preliminary or other articles of peace, by which the same may be terminated.</P>
<P>And it is further agreed, that at the expiration of the said term, the two contracting parties will endeavour fur∣ther to regulate their commerce in this respect according to the situation in which his Majesty may then find him∣self with respect to the West-Indies, and with a view to such arrangements as may best conduce to the mutual advantage and extension of commerce. And the said parties will then also renew their discussions, and endea∣vour to agree, whether in any and what cases neutral vessels shall protect enemy's property; and in what cases, provisions and other articles, not generally contraband, may become such.

Provided only, that it shall not be lawful for them in any time of war between the British government and any other power or state what∣ever, to export from the said territories, without the special permission of the British government there, any military stores, or naval stores, or rice. The citizens of the United States shall pay for their vessels, when admit∣ted into the said ports, no other or higher tonnage duty than shall be payable on British vessels, when admitted into the ports of the United States. And they shall pay no other or higher duties or charges, on the importation or exportation of the cargoes of the said vessels, than shall be payable on the same articles when imported or exported in British vessels. But it is expressly agreed, that the vessels of the United States shall not carry any of the articles exported by them from the said British territories, to any port or place, except to some port or place in America, where the same shall be unladen, and such regu∣lations shall be adopted by both parties, as shall from time to time be found necessary to enforce the due and faithful observance of this stipulation. It is also under∣stood that the permission granted by this article, is not to extend to allow the vessels of the United States to carry on any part of the coasting trade of the said British terri∣tories; but vessels going with their original cargoes, or part thereof, from one port of discharge to another, are not to be considered as carrying on the coasting trade. Neither is this article to be construed to allow the citizens of the said states to settle or reside within the said territo∣ries, or to go into the interior parts thereof, without the permission of the British government established there; and if any transgression should be attempted against the regulations of the British government in this respect, the observance of the same shall and may be enforced against the citizens of America in the same manner as against British subjects, or others transgressing the same rule. And the citizens of the United States, whenever they arrive in any port or harbour in the said territories, or if they should be permitted in manner aforesaid, to go to any other place therein, shall always be subject to the laws, government and jurisdiction of what nature estab∣lished in such harbour, port or place, according as the

Nor shall any prohibition be imposed on the exportation or importation of any articles to or from the territories of the two parties respectively, which shall not equally extend to all other nations.</P>

<P>And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the precise cases in which alone provisions and other articles not generally contraband may be regarded as such, renders it expedient to provide against the inconveniencies and mis∣understandings which might thence arise: It is further agreed, that whenever any such articles so becoming con∣traband, according to the existing laws of nations, shall for that reason be seized, the same shall not be confisca∣ted, but the owners thereof shall be speedily and com∣pletely indemnified; and the captors, or in their default, the government under whose authority they act, shall pay to the masters or owners of such vessels, the full value of all such articles, with a reasonable mercantile profit there∣on, together with the freight, and also the demurrage in∣cident to such detention.</P>
<P>And whereas it frequently happens that vessels sail for a port or place belonging to an enemy, without knowing that the same is either besieged, blockaded, or invested; it is agreed, that every vessel so circumstanced, may be turned away from such port or place, but she shall not be detained, nor her cargo, if not contraband, be con∣fiscated,

No shelter or refuge shall be given in their ports to such as have made a prize upon the subjects or citizens of either of the said parties: but if forced by stress of weather, or the dangers of the sea, to enter therein, particular care shall be taken to hasten their departure, and to cause them to retire as soon as possible. Nothing in this Treaty contained shall, however, be construed or operate con∣trary to former and existing public treaties with other sovereigns or states. But the two parties agree, that while they continue in amity, neither of them will, in fu∣ture, make any Treaty that shall be inconsistent with this or the preceding article.</P>
<P>Neither of the said parties shall permit the ships or goods belonging to the subjects or citizens of the other, to be taken within cannon shot of the coast, nor in any of the bays, ports, or rivers of their territories, by ships of war, or others having commission from any prince, repub∣lic, or state whatever. But in case it should so happen, the party whose territorial rights shall thus have been vio∣lated,

shall use his utmost endeavours to obtain from the offending party, full and ample satisfaction for the vessel or vessels so taken, whether the same be vessels of war or merchant vessels.</P>

<HEAD>TREATY of Friendship, Limits and Navigation between the United States of Ameri∣ca, and the King of Spain.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Catholic Majesty and the United States of A∣merica, desiring to consolidate, on a permanent basis, the friendship and good correspondence, which hap∣pily prevails between the two parties, have determined to establish, by a convention, several points, the settle∣ment whereof will be productive of general advantage and reciprocal utility to both nations.</P>
<P>With this intention, his Catholic Majesty has appoint∣ed the most excellent Lord, don Manuel de Godoy, and Alvarez de Faria, Rios, Sanchez, Zarzosa, Prince de la Paz, duke de la Alcudia, lord of the Soto de Roma and of the state of Albala, Grandee of Spain of the first class, perpetual regidor of the city of Santiago, knight of the illustrious order of the Golden Fleece, and Great Cross of the Royal and distinguished Spanish order of Charles the IIId. commander of Valencia, del Ventoso, Rivera, and Acenchal in that of Santiago; Knight and Great Cross of the religious order of St. John; Counsel∣lor of state; first Secretary of state and despacho; Sec∣retary to the Queen; Superintendant General of the posts and highways; Protector of the royal Academy of the noble arts, and of the royal societies of natural his∣tory, botany, chemistry, and astronomy; Gentleman of the King's chamber in employment; Captain General of his armies; Inspector and Major of the royal corps of body guards, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and the President of the United States, with the advice and consent of their Senate, has appointed Thomas Pinckney, a citizen of the United States, and their Envoy Extraordinary to his Catholic Majesty. And the said Plenipotentiaries have agreed upon and con∣cluded the following articles:</P>
<P><LABEL>ARTICLE I.</LABEL>
There shall be a firm and inviolable peace and sincere friendship between his Catholic Majesty, his successors and
<PB N="50" REF="033045_0049_0FF62FA80C2734C0"/>
subjects, and the United States, and their citizens, with∣out exception of persons or places.</P>
<P>ART. II. To prevent all disputes on the subject of the boundaries which separate the territories of the two high contracting parties, it is hereby declared and agreed as follows, to wit. The southern boundary of the United States, which divides their territory from the Spanish colonies of East and West Florida, shall be designated by a line beginning on the river Missisippi, at the northernmost part of the thirty-first degree of latitude north of the equa∣tor, which from thence shall be drawn due east to the middle of the river Apalachicola, or Catahouche, thence along the middle thereof to its junction with the Flint: thence strait to the head of St. Mary's river, and thence down the middle thereof to the Atlantic ocean. And it is agreed, that if there should be any troops, garrisons, or settlements of either party, in the territory of the other, according to the abovementioned boundaries, they shall be withdrawn from the said territory within the term of six months after the ratification of this treaty, or sooner if it be possible; and that they shall be permitted to take with them all the goods and effects which they possess.</P>
<P>ART. III. In order to carry the preceding article into effect, one commissioner and one surveyor shall be ap∣pointed by each of the contracting parties, who shall meet at the Natchez, on the left side of the river Missisippi, be∣fore the expiration of six months from the ratification of this convention, and they shall proceed to run and mark this boundary according to the stipulations of the said article. They shall make plats and keep journals of their proceedings, which shall be considered as part of this convention, and shall have the same force as if they were inserted therein. And if on any account it should be found necessary that the said commissioners and survey∣ors should be accompanied by guards, they shall be fur∣nished in equal proportions by the commanding officer of his Majesty's troops in the two Floridas, and the com∣manding officer of the troops of the United States in their southwestern territory, who shall act by common consent, and amicably, as well with respect to this point as to the furnishing of provisions and instruments, and making every other arrangement which may be necessary or useful for the execution of this article.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="033045_0050_0FF62FAAAB328860"/>ART. IV. It is likewise agreed that the western boun∣dary of the United States which separates them from the Spanish colony of Louisiana, is in the middle of the chan∣nel or bed of the river Missisippi, from the northern boun∣dary of the said states to the completion of the thirty-first degree of latitude north of the equator. And his Catholic Majesty has likewise agreed that the navigation of the said river, in its whole breadth from its source to the ocean, shall be free only to his subjects and the citi∣zens of the United States, unless he should extend this privilege to the subjects of other powers by special con∣vention.</P>
<P>ART. V. The two high contracting parties shall, by all the means in their power, maintain peace and har∣mony among the several Indian nations who inhabit the country adjacent to the lines and rivers, which, by the preceding articles, form the boundaries of the two Flori∣das. And the better to obtain this effect, both parties oblige themselves expressly to restrain by force all hostil∣ities on the part of the Indian nations living within their boundary: so that Spain will not suffer her Indians to attack the citizens of the United States, nor the Indians inhabiting their territory; nor will the United States permit these last-mentioned Indians to commence hos∣tilities against the subjects of his Catholic Majesty or his Indians, in any manner whatever.</P>
<P>And whereas several treaties of friendship exist between the two contracting parties and the said nations of Indians, it is hereby agreed that in future no treaty of alliance or other whatever (except treaties of peace) shall be made by either party with the Indians living within the boun∣dary of the other, but both parties will endeavour to make the advantages of the Indian trade common and mutually beneficial to their respective subjects and citizens, observing in all things the most complete reciprocity, so that both parties may obtain the advantages arising from a good understanding with the said nations, without be∣ing subject to the expence which they have hitherto occa∣sioned.</P>
<P>ART. VI. Each party shall endeavour, by all means in their power, to protect and defend all vessels and other effects belonging to the citizens or subjects of the other,
<PB N="52" REF="033045_0051_0FF62FACEDEFFAB0"/>
which shall be within the extent of their jurisdiction by sea or by land, and shall use all their efforts to recover and cause to be restored to the right owners, their vessels and effects which may have been taken from them within the extent of their said jurisdiction, whether they are at war or not with the power whose subjects have taken posses∣sion of the said effects.</P>
<P>ART. VII. And it is agreed that the subjects or citi∣zens of each of the contracting parties, their vessels or effects, shall not be liable to any embargo or detention on the part of the other, for any military expedition or other public or private purpose whatever: And in all cases of seizure, detention, or arrest for debts contracted, or offences committed by any citizen or subject of the one party within the jurisdiction of the other, the same shall be made and prosecuted by order and authority of law only, and according to the regular course of proceedings usual in such cases. The citizens and subjects of both parties shall be allowed to employ such advocates, solicitors, no∣taries, agents and factors, as they may judge proper, in all their affairs, and in all their trials at law, in which they may be concerned, before the tribunals of the other party; and such agents shall have free access to be pre∣sent at the proceedings in such causes, and at the taking of all examinations and evidence which may be exhibited in the said trials.</P>
<P>ART. VIII. In case the subjects and inhabitants of either party, with their shipping, whether public and of war, or private and of merchants, be forced, through stress of weather, pursuit of pirates or enemies, or any other urgent necessity, for seeking of shelter and harbour, to retreat and enter into any of the rivers, bays, roads or ports belonging to the other party, they shall be received and treated with all humanity, and enjoy all favour, pro∣tection and help, and they shall be permitted to refresh and provide themselves, at reasonable rates, with victuals and all things needful for the sustenance of their persons, or reparation of their ships and prosecution of their voyage; and they shall no ways be hindered from returning out of the said ports or roads, but may remove and de∣part when and whither they please, without any let or hindrance.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="033045_0052_0FF62FAE8105EAC8"/>ART. IX. All ships and merchandize, of what nature soever, which shall be rescued out of the hands of any pirates or robbers on the high seas, shall be brought into some port of either state, and shall be delivered to the custody of the officers of that port, in order to be taken care of, and restored entire to the true proprietor, as soon as due and sufficient proof shall be made concerning the property thereof.</P>
<P>ART. X. When any vessel of either party shall be wrecked, foundered, or otherwise damaged, on the coasts or within the dominion of the other, their respective sub∣jects or citizens shall receive, as well for themselves as for their vessels and effects, the same assistance which would be due to the inhabitants of the country where the dam∣age happens, and shall pay the same charges and dues only as the said inhabitants would be subject to pay in a like case: And if the operations of repair should require that the whole or any part of the cargo be unladen, they shall pay no duties, charges or fees on the part which they shall relade and cary away.</P>
<P>ART. XI. The citizens and subjects of each party shall have power to dispose of their personal goods with∣in the jurisdiction of the other, by testament, donation or otherwise, and their representatives being subjects or citi∣zens of the other party, shall succeed to their said personal goods whether by testament or ab intestato, and they may take possession thereof, either by themselves or others act∣ing for them, and dispose of the same at their will, pay∣ing such dues as the inhabitants of the country wherein the said goods are, shall be subject to pay in like cases.</P>
<P>And in case of the absence of the representatives, such care shall be taken of the said goods, as would be taken of the goods of a native in like case, until the lawful own∣er may take measures for receiving them. And if ques∣tions shall arise among several claimants to which of them the said goods belong, the same shall be decided finally by the laws and judges of the land wherein the said goods are. And where, on the death of any person holding real estate within the territories of the one party, such real estate would by the laws of the land descend on a citizen or subject of the other, were he not disqualified by being an alien, such subject shall be allowed a reason∣able
<PB N="54" REF="033045_0053_0FF62FB034DDEF80"/>
time to sell the same, and to withdraw the proceed, without molestation, and exempt from all rights of de∣traction on the part of the government of the respective states.</P>
<P>ART. XII. The merchant-ships of either of the parties which shall be making into a port belonging to the enemy of the other party, and concerning whose voyage, and the species of goods on board her, there shall be just grounds of suspicion, shall be obliged to exhibit as well upon the high seas as in the ports and havens, not only her passports, but likewise certificates, expressly shewing that her goods are not of the number of those which have been prohibited as contraband.</P>
<P>ART. XIII. For the better promoting of commerce on both sides, it is agreed, that if a war shall break out between the said two nations, one year after the procla∣mation of war shall be allowed to the merchants, in the cities and towns where they shall live, for collecting and transporting their goods and merchandizes: And if any thing be taken from them or any injury be done them within that term, by either party, or the people or sub∣jects of either, full satisfaction shall be made for the same by the government.</P>
<P>ART. XIV. No subject of his Catholic Majesty shall apply for, or take any commission or letters of marque, for arming any ship or ships to act as privateers against the said United States, or against the citizens, people or inhabitants of the said United States, or against the pro∣perty of any of the inhabitants of any of them, from any prince or state with which the said United States shall be at war.</P>
<P>Nor shall any citizen, subject or inhabitant of the said United States apply for or take any commission or let∣ters of marque for arming any ship or ships to act as pri∣vateers against the subjects of his Catholic Majesty, or the property of any of them, from any prince or state with which the said king shall be at war. And if any person of either nation shall take such commissions or let∣ters of marque, he shall be punished as a pirate.</P>
<P>ART. XV. It shall be lawful for all and singular the subjects of his Catholic Majesty, and the citizens, people and inhabitants of the said United States, to sail with
<PB N="55" REF="033045_0054_0FF62FB2F0408618"/>
their ships, with all manner of liberty and security, no distinction being made who are the proprietors of the merchandizes laden thereon, from any port to the places of those who now are, or hereafter shall be at enmity with his Catholic Majesty or the United States. It shall be likewise lawful for the subjects and inhabitants afore∣said, to sail with the ships and merchandizes aforemen∣tioned, and to trade with the same liberty and security from the places, ports and havens of those who are ene∣mies of both or either party, without any opposition or disturbance whatsoever, not only directly from the places of the enemy aforementioned, to neutral places, but also from one place belonging to an enemy, to another place belonging to an enemy, whether they be under the juris∣diction of the same prince or under several; and it is hereby stipulated, that free ships shall also give freedom to goods, and that every thing shall be deemed free and exempt which shall be found on board the ships belong∣ing to the subjects of either of the contracting parties, although the whole lading, or any part thereof, should appertain to the enemies of either: Contraband goods being always excepted. It is also agreed, that the same liberty be extended to persons who are on board a free ship, so that although they be enemies to either party, they shall not be made prisoners or taken out of that free ship, unless they are soldiers and in actual service of the enemies.</P>
<P>ART. XVI. This liberty of navigation and commerce shall extend to all kinds of merchandizes, excepting those only, which are distinguished by the name of contraband: And under this name of contraband or prohibited goods, shall be comprehended arms, great guns, bombs, with the fusees, and the other things belonging to them, can∣non-ball, gunpowder, match, pikes, swords, lances, spears, halberds, mortars, petards, grenades, saltpetre, mus∣quets, musquet-ball, bucklers, helmets, breast-plates, coats of mail, and the like kinds of arms, proper for arming soldiers, musquet rests, belts, horses with their furniture, and all other warlike instruments whatever. These mer∣chandizes which follow, shall not be reckoned among contraband or prohibited goods: That is to say, all sorts of cloths, and all other manufactures woven of any wool,
<PB N="56" REF="033045_0055_0FF62FB4D9E8A120"/>
flax, silk, cotton, or any other materials whatever; all kinds of wearing apparel, together with all species where∣of they are used to be made; gold and silver, as well coined as uncoined, tin, iron, latten, copper, brass, coals; as also wheat, barley and oats, and any other kind of corn and pulse; tobacco, and likewise all manner of spices, salted and smoked flesh, salted fish, cheese and but∣ter, beer, oils, wines, sugars, and all sorts of salts: And in general, all provisions which serve for the sustenance of life: Furthermore, all kinds of cotton, hemp, flax, tar, pitch, ropes, cables, sails, sail-cloths, anchors, and any parts of anchors, also ships' masts, planks and wood of all kind, and all other things proper either for building or repairing ships, and all other goods whatever, which have not been worked into the form of any instrument prepared for war, by land or by sea, shall not be reputed contraband, much less, such as have been already wrought and made up for any other use; all which shall be wholly reckoned among free goods: As likewise all oth∣er merchandizes and things which are not comprehended and particularly mentioned in the foregoing enumeration of contraband goods: So that they may be transported and carried in the freest manner by the subjects of both parties, even to places belonging to an enemy, such towns or places being only excepted, as are at that time besieg∣ed, blocked up, or invested. And except the cases in which any ship of war, or squadron shall, in consequence of storms or other accidents at sea, be under the necessity of taking the cargo of any trading vessel or vessels, in which case they may stop the said vessel or vessels, and furnish themselves with necessaries, giving a receipt, in order that the power to whom the said ship of war be∣longs, may pay for the articles so taken, according to the price thereof, at the port to which they may appear to have been destined by the ship's papers; and the two contracting parties engage, that the vessels shall not be detained longer than may be absolutely necessary for their said ships to supply themselves with necessaries: That they will immediately pay the value of the receipts, and indemnify the proprietor for all losses which he may have sustained in consequence of such transaction.</P>
<P>ART. XVII. To the end, that all manner of dissen∣tions
<PB N="57" REF="033045_0056_0FF62FB676A107F8"/>
and quarrels may be avoided and prevented on one side and the other, it is agreed, that in case either of the parties hereto, should be engaged in a war, the ships and vessels belonging to the subjects or people of the other party must be furnished with sea-letters or passports, ex∣pressing the name, property, and bulk of the ship, as also the name and place of habitation of the master or com∣mander of the said ship, that it may appear thereby, that the ship really and truly belongs to the subjects of one of the parties, which passport shall be made out and granted according to the form annexed to this treaty. They shall likewise be recalled every year, that is, if the ship hap∣pens to return home within the space of a year.</P>
<P>It is likewise agreed, that such ships being laden, are to be provided not only with passports as above-mention∣ed, but also with certificates, containing the several par∣ticulars of the cargo, the place whence the ship sailed, that so it may be known whether any forbidden or con∣traband goods be on board the same: which certificates shall be made out by the officers of the place whence the ship sailed in the accustomed form: And if any one shall think it fit or advisable to express in the said certificates, the person to whom the goods on board belong, he may freely do so: Without which requisites they may be sent to one of the ports of the other contracting party, and adjudged by the competent tribunal, according to what is above set forth, that all the circumstances of this omis∣sion having been well examined, they shall be adjudged to be legal prizes, unless they shall give legal satisfaction of their property by testimony entirely equivalent.</P>
<P>ART. XVIII. If the ships of the said subjects, people, or inhabitants of either of the parties, shall be met with, either sailing along the coasts or on the high seas, by any ship of war of the other, or by any privateer, the said ship of war or privateer for the avoiding of any disorder, shall remain out of cannon shot, and may send their boats a-board the merchant ship, which they shall so meet with, and may enter her to the number of two or three men only, to whom the master or commander of such ship or vessel shall exhibit his passports, concerning the property of the ship, made out according to the form inserted in this present treaty, and the ship when she shall have shewed
<PB N="58" REF="033045_0057_0FF62FB80ADC9808"/>
such passport, shall be free and at liberty to pursue her voy∣age, so as it shall not be lawful to molest or give her chace in any manner, or force her to quit her intended course.</P>
<P>ART. XIX. Consuls shall be reciprocally established, with the privileges and powers which those of the most favoured nations enjoy, in the ports where their consuls reside or are permitted to be.</P>
<P>ART. XX. It is also agreed that the inhabitants of the territories of each party shall respectively have free access to the courts of justice of the other, and they shall be permitted to prosecute suits for the recovery of their properties, the payment of their debts, and for obtaining satisfaction for the damages which they may have sustain∣ed, whether the persons whom they may sue be subjects or citizens of the country in which they may be found, or any other persons whatsoever, who may have taken refuge therein; and the proceedings and sentences of the said courts shall be the same as if the contending parties had been subjects or citizens of the said country.</P>
<P>ART. XXI. In order to terminate all differences on account of the losses sustained by the citizens of the Uni∣ted States in consequence of their vessels and cargoes having been taken by the subjects of his Catholic Majesty, during the late war between Spain and France, it is agreed that all such cases shall be referred to the final de∣cision of commissioners to be appointed in the following manner. His Catholic Majesty shall name one commis∣sioner, and the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of their Senate, shall appoint another, and the said two commissioners shall agree on the choice of a third, or if they cannot agree so, they shall each propose one person, and of the two names so proposed, one shall be drawn by lot in the presence of the two original commissioners, and the person whose name shall be so drawn, shall be the third commissioner: And the three commissioners so appointed, shall be sworn impartially to examine and decide the claims in question, according to the merits of the several cases, and to jus∣tice, equity, and the laws of nations. The said commis∣sioners shall meet and sit at Philadelphia: And in the case of the death, sickness, or necessary absence of any such commissioner, his place shall be supplied in the same
<PB N="59" REF="033045_0058_0FF62FBADBAE1EE0"/>
manner as he was first appointed, and the new commis∣sioner shall take the same oaths, and do the same duties. They shall receive all complaints and applications author∣ized by this article, during eighteen months from the day on which they shall assemble. They shall have pow∣er to examine all such persons as come before them on oath or affirmation, touching the complaints in question, and also to receive in evidence all written testimony, au∣thenticated in such manner as they shall think proper to require or admit. The award of the said commissioners, or any two of them, shall be final and conclusive, both as to the justice of the claim and the amount of the sum to be paid to the claimants; and his Catholic Majesty un∣dertakes to cause the same to be paid in specie, without deduction, at such times and places, and under such con∣ditions as shall be awarded by the said commissioners.</P>
<P>ART. XXII. The two high contracting parties, hop∣ing that the good correspondence and friendship which happily reigns between them, will be further encreased by this treaty, and that it will contribute to augment their prosperity and opulence, will in future give to their mutual commerce all the extension and favour which the advantages of both countries may require.</P>
<P>And in consequence of the stipulations contained in the 4th article, his Catholic Majesty will permit the citizens of the U∣nited States, for the space of three years from this time, to de∣posit their merchandizes and effects in the port of New-Orleans, and to export them from thence without paying any other duty than a fair price for the hire of the stores, and his Majesty pro∣mises either to continue this permission, if he finds during that time that it is not prejudicial to the interests of Spain, or if he should not agree to continue it there, he will assign to them, on another part of the banks of the Missisippi, an equivalent establishment.</P>
<P>ART. XXIII. The present treaty shall not be in force un∣til ratified by the contracting parties, and the ratifications shall be exchanged in six months from this time, or sooner if possible.</P>
<P>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, we, the underwritten plenipotentiaries of his Catholic Majesty and of the United States of Ame∣rica, have signed this present treaty of friendship, limits and navigation, and have thereunto affixed our seals respectively.</P>

<HEAD>TREATY of Peace and Friendship between the United States of America and the Bey and Subjects of Tripoli of Barbary.</HEAD>
<P><LABEL>ARTICLE I.</LABEL>
THERE is a firm and perpetual peace and friend∣ship between the United States of America and the Bey and subjects of Tripoli of Barbary, made by the free consent of both parties, and guarantied by the Most Potent Dey and Regency of Algiers.</P>
<P><LABEL>ART. II.</LABEL> If any goods belonging to any nation with which either of the parties is at war, shall be loaded on board of vessels belonging to the other party, they shall pass free, and no attempt shall be made to take or de∣tain them.</P>
<P><LABEL>ART. III.</LABEL> If any citizens, subjects or effects belong∣ing to either party, shall be found on board a prize vessel taken from an enemy by the other party, such citizens or subjects shall be set at liberty, and the effects restored to the owners.</P>
<P><LABEL>ART. IV.</LABEL> Proper passports are to be given to all ves∣sels of both parties, by which they are to be known. And considering the distance between the two countries, eighteen months from the date of this treaty shall be allow∣ed for procuring such passports. During this interval the other papers belonging to such vessels shall be sufficient for their protection.</P>
<P><LABEL>ART. V.</LABEL> A citizen or subject of either party having bought a prize condemned by the party or by any other nation, the certificate of condemnation and bill of sale shall be a sufficient passport for such vessels for one year: this being a reasonable time for her to procure a proper passport.</P>
<P><LABEL>ART. VI.</LABEL> Vessels of either party putting into the ports of the other, and having need of provisions or oth∣er
<PB N="70" REF="033045_0067_0FF62FCB6111B2C0"/>
supplies, they shall be furnished at the market price. And if any such vessel shall so put in from a disaster at sea, and have occasion to repair, she shall be at liberty to land and re-embark her cargo, without paying any duties. But in no case shall she be compelled to land her cargo.</P>
<P><LABEL>ART. VII.</LABEL> Should a vessel of either party be cast on the shore of the other, all proper assistance shall be given to her and her people; no pillage shall be allowed, the property shall remain at the disposition of the owners, and the crew protected and succoured till they can be sent to their country.</P>
<P><LABEL>ART. VIII.</LABEL> If a vessel of either party should be attacked by an enemy within gun shot of the sorts of the other, she shall be defended as much as pos∣sible. If she be in port, she shall not be seized or attack∣ed when it is in the power of the other party to protect her; and when she proceeds to sea no enemy shall be al∣lowed to pursue her from the same port within twenty-four hours after her departure.</P>
<P><LABEL>ART. IX.</LABEL> The commerce between the United States and Tripoli—the protection to be given to merchants, masters of vessels and seamen—the reciprocal right of es∣tablishing consuls in each country, and the privileges, im∣munities and jurisdictions to be enjoyed by such consuls, are declared to be on the same footing with those of the most favoured nations respectively.</P>
<P><LABEL>ART. X.</LABEL> The money and presents demanded by the Bey of Tripoli as a full and satisfactory consideration on his part, and on the part of his subjects, for this treaty of perpetual peace and friendship, we acknowledged to have been received by him previous to his signing the same, according to a receipt which is hereto annexed, except such part as is promised on the part of the United States to be delivered and paid by them on the arrival of their consul in Tripoli, of which part a note is likewise hereto annexed. And no pretence of any periodical tribute or farther payment is ever to be made by either party.</P>
<P><LABEL>ART. XI.</LABEL> As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion, as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquillity of Musselmen—and as the said States have never entered into any war or act of
<PB N="71" REF="033045_0068_0FF62FCD804ED3B0"/>
hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.</P>
<P><LABEL>ART. XII.</LABEL> In case of any dispute arising from a vio∣lation of any of the articles of this treaty, no appeal shall be made to arms, nor shall war be declared on any pre∣text whatever. But if the consul residing on the place where the dispute shall happen, shall not be able to settle the same, an amicable reference shall be made to the mu∣tual friend of the parties, the Dey of Algiers, hereby en∣gaging to abide by his decision. And he, by virtue of his signature to this treaty, engages for himself and his successors, to declare the justice of the case according to the true interpretation of the treaty, and to use all the means in his power to enforce the observance of the same.</P>
