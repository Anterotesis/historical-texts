<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ZECHARIAH, Chap. xiith, Verse 12th.</BIBL>
<Q>And the land shall mourn, every family apart.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My COUNTRYMEN and BRETHERN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MUST America be the unhappy people, as it were, the Jews raised from the dead to perpe∣trate the same wickedness over again, but under greater light, that our ruin in the end may be still more com∣pleat, and our condemnation, like that of Capernaum at the day of judgment, be seven fold enhanced!</P>
<P>WE see that while the calls of GOD to repentance wax louder, the cry of our sabbath-breaking, swearing, uncleaness, and many other sins, waxes louder and louder, and like the cry of Sodom comes up before GOD: And HE is now come down in his righteous judgment among us, and pleads against us, for the abuses we of∣fer to his bleeding Son, who is crucified in every un∣believing heart.</P>
<P>WHAT shall we do? We cannot stand before his anger! Shall dust magnify itself against him that tread∣eth thereon? Or the chaff against the wind? Or the dry stubble against the raging flames?</P>
<P>LET us then, every family and every person, mourn apart for our sins. Let each one, with himself, cry 
<PB N="4" REF="043342_0003_101D041F08D477B0"/>
Alas! Alas for my sins!—How much have I done to pull down the judgments of GOD upon the land!—O how did I sin!—How was my sin aggravated!—How did I sin wilfully!—Against my own conscience, against examples, against many warnings and admonitions, a∣gainst mercies and against judgments, and after vows made in sickness and in danger; how have I restrained prayer, abused sabbaths, neglected GOD's word, dispis∣ed his people, pierced his Son and grieved his Holy Spirlt! Oh! How have I observed lying vanities and forsaken mine own mercies!</P>
<P>LET conscience, she is one of thy best friends, let conscience now have full scope, and range with freedom through all thy life, and bring up every sin, and place it before thee in its blackest colours, as it would appear to thee if thou wer't now upon thy death bed.</P>
<P>Nay, let conscience dive into the heart and search e∣very corner of it; and pray GOD to search you and to shew you more and more the blackness, the filthiness and turpitude of your own heart. There see your con∣trariety to GOD, your unreconciledness to his ways, your disaffection to his holiness. View your heart in the glass of GOD's perfect word;—view it as discribed in Matthew xv. 19.</P>
<P>VIEW it as the seat of pride, malice, hypocrisy, un∣belief, covetousness and sensuality; view it as the foun∣tain, as the sea of Sodom, from whence all the streams of wickedness flow.—View the sins of your life, view them over again and again; let them be continually be∣fore you; but the heart like an ocean swallows them all;—view the evil of them especially as they are against a GOD of infinite purity and excellence. Let us view them as the thorns, the nails and the spear that pierced the LORD of life.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="043342_0004_101D0421A1BC4AA0"/>
VIEW the just damand's of GOD's all-perfect law,—<HI>The soul that sineth it shall die,</HI> Ezekiel xviii. 4. View the rottenness of your own righteousness, the sins of your best services, and be humbled under your moral inabili∣ty to help yourselves.</P>
<P>AND when you have wandered up and down in self, and in the world, seeking help of creatures, and have found none, come to JESUS CHRIST, he can help when all others fail. He is able to save to the uttermost. Come to him; thousands reject him and are damned; but come ye to this infinitely glorious SAVIOUR, and prove his excellence.</P>
<P>THE Greeks came to him at the feast; Nichodemas came to him; the Cyrophenician woman came to him, thousands have come to him miserable as you are, and not one that cometh will be cast out.</P>
<P>Do you say if he were upon earth as he was once, you would come to him?—I tell you JESUS CHRIST is even now upon earth by his word and spirit; he is here in his humble form by his witnesses and people, and blessed are they who are not offended in him: Verily you may now come to him in a manner that is as pleasing to him, and as saving to you, as if you had beheld him and come to him in the days of his flesh upon earth.</P>
<P>O COME to him; come now; come as you are; come beggars; come with all your sins, blindness, poverty and disgrace, cast yourselves at his feet. He, the glori∣ous LAMB of GOD, invites you, saying come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</P>
<P>IF you think you are even as black as the blackest in hell, come and be married to the PRINCE of LIFE. Come, experience the efficacy of his all purifying blood, 
<PB N="6" REF="043342_0005_101D04242B8D6230"/>
which never failed to cleanse the blackest; no not Mary Magdalen, a persecuting Saul, or a thief on the cross. But it may be, one say's, I am worse than any of these, I have sinned beyond them! Well, dear heart, what then? What if you are legion, possessed of a legion of devils? Don't let us distrust CHRIST's sufficiency or his willing∣ness; he is stronger than the strong man armed; he conquers hell and death, and shouts his victories. Dis∣pair not; thank GOD that he has begun to open your eyes, while others are going blindfold to hell.</P>
<P>BE not weary of your sadness, while the laughter, the scoffing and mirth of fools is like the crackling of thorns under a pot—You now sorrow and they rejoice; but it is possible, if you grieve not the holy spirit, that you may yet rejoice when they may sorrow without hope. Think how intollerable hell would be, were it only to dwell forever with thine own unsanctified self, under the reigning power of thine unrestraining passions, hav∣ing an accusing conscience, that worm which dieth not, forever praying like a vulture upon thine heartstrings. Every man is born and brought up with the seeds of hell in him 'till grace subdues them.</P>
<P>As you would not endure this; as you would not endure the wrath of Almighty GOD, with devils in the flaming regions of endless dispair; and as you would obtain pardon, peace, joy, bliss and glory above, come to JE∣SUS CHRIST for all that you need.</P>
<P>COME to him for teaching; he is a glorious teacher come from GOD; lie at his feet; confess your sins; make restitution to those you have injured; forgive your enemy from the heart; and as you forgive, pray GOD, for CHRIST's sake, to forgive you.</P>
<P>THUS come to JESUS CHRIST to have sins pardoned, guilt removed, lusts and corruptions subdued, grace and strength communicated.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="043342_0006_101D0426073B7C78"/>
RENOUNCE the world, the flesh and the devil, give up yourself, your all, to GOD, in JESUS CHRIST, to be his entirely, to do or to suffer whatever he calls you to in life, trusting in his merits alone for the acceptance of your persons and services.</P>
<P>THESE are the terms of divine favour to every per∣son; O how glorious! How infinitely reasonable our compliance! GOD does not require us to investigate the number of fixed stars, or to track the blazing comet, but <HI>that we believe on him whom he hath sent.</HI> Here is peace, if all the world are at odds, and safety, if the heavens and earth be dissolved.</P>
<P>BUT for us to continue stupid and secure in this day, is more awful than the judgments we feel, being a surer foreboder of ruin. In this sense, <HI>quos deus vult perdere prius dementat.</HI> O madness without parallel, and ruin without remedy!</P>
<P><HI>Wherefore, my countrymen and brethren,</HI></P>
<P>LET us no longer, like the Jews, mock the great Je∣hovah with our hypocritical shews, as we have often done, for he looks at the inward part: Therefore let us repent and turn unto him with all our heart, if perad∣venture the LORD may yet turn from his fierce anger, that is kindled against us, and be a present help in time of need. Let us not be deceived; GOD is not mocked. But let us, O land, repent indeed of our sins, of our profaneness, of our drunkenness, of our un∣cleanness, of our sabbath-breaking, of our injustice, of our covetousness and oppression, of our neglect of fa∣mily and other devotions; let us repent and mourn for our horrid abuse of the glorious gospel and the greatest privileges that ever a nation enjoyed. And, in the matter of oppression, do not the thing that thou condemnest in another, knowing that with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again, Matthew, vii, 2. For these sins our fields have more than once smoaked with the blood of our young men; many wives are now be∣come widows, and many children are become fatherless, 
<PB N="8" REF="043342_0007_101D0427C9D03118"/>
and thousands of our brethren are slain, or wounded, or carried into captivity.</P>
<P>WHEREAS we all, ministers, rulers and people, have by our sins procured this, let us all as one man unite in repenting and turning unto the LORD. Let every family and every person mourn apart, and no longer, by provoking GOD, go on to plunge the fatal steel into the bosoms of our dear ones. What I say to one, I say to all. Let every parent and every child, every town and every society, cry to GOD for his help, sending up every prayer in the name of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. Pray in public, pray in your families, in your closets, or in the fields; pray with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, pray and faint not. Let incessent fervent prayers be ascending up to GOD from all parts of the land, that he, in his infinite love and mercy, will ap∣pear for us, and cause his blessed spirit to be poured out that we may be awakened to a thorough reformation; and that GOD would save us when we have no might to save ourselves.</P>
<P><HI>But to those who in this day frolick and carouse.</HI></P>
<P>MY FRIENDS, though you forget your sins, yet re∣member your sins will not forget you: If you fly from them they will follow you, as the shadow doth its sub∣stance; and no distance or time, nor change of place, can alter or efface them. While you murder time at your revels, conscience behind the door minutes even your thoughts, and her black bill is now reposited in store against you, which death will soon read;—he, the end of all your mirth, is now at the door, and hell follows with him. O what a change is at hand! Now you dance to the violin; then you must dance to death's pipe. Now the sparks of lust kindle, then the fire of hell burns. Now you sin in jest; then GOD damns in earnest. Now you bark at the word; then you howl at yourselves.</P>
<P>O be wise; for what is a sand to the globe; a drop to the ocean; a sunbeam to its fountain, and a short life of mirth to eternal pain.</P>
