<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>God</HI> and of the <HI>Souls</HI> of <HI>Men,</HI> prevailed with me to write the following <HI>Treatise,</HI> to pay the Debt I have long owed to my fellow Creatures; in intreating them to enter into their own Hearts, and learn <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> of <HI>God himself,</HI> who speaks <HI>there</HI> by <HI>His Spirit</HI> as never <HI>Man</HI> spoke; who speaks <HI>there</HI> to much better Purpose, with <HI>clearer Evidence</HI> and <HI>Demonstration</HI> than <HI>Men</HI> can <HI>speak; that their Faith might not stand in the Wisdom of Men, but in the Power of God</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Which is the <HI>only Remedy,</HI> as I apprehend, for <HI>restoring Piety</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> to its <HI>primative</HI> Purity and Beauty, in an Age wherein the ex∣cessive Pretension to Power, in <HI>some</HI> of the <HI>Clergy</HI> (perhaps not of the best Lives) have made a great many Men of <HI>excellent</HI> Capacities
<PB N="iv" REF="003985_0003_10036B4EE7AE2C30"/>
<HI>too loose,</HI> and <HI>indifferent</HI> unto <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Re∣ligion.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis sad to think, that because some <HI>high Pretenders</HI> to <HI>Religion,</HI> who are of bad Lives and Principles, would exercise <HI>Dominion</HI> over the <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Consciences</HI> of others, and turn <HI>Re∣ligion</HI> into <HI>worldly</HI> Riches and Immunities, make <HI>Gain</HI> their <HI>Godliness,</HI> and the <HI>Lust</HI> of <HI>Power</HI> their <HI>earnest Pursuit</HI>; (I say 'tis sad to think) that therefore Religion, the most <HI>noble</HI> and <HI>necessary</HI> Thing in the World, should fall be∣low the <HI>Regards</HI> of Men.</P>
<P>Because Men of <HI>bright</HI> Parts and <HI>great</HI> Inge∣nuity, have by the <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>Reason</HI> baffled those <HI>exorbitant</HI> Claims; to think therefore <HI>God</HI> doth not afford Men any <HI>superior Light</HI> and <HI>Aid</HI>; this is to run into the other Ex∣tream.</P>
<P>For tho' none of the <HI>real</HI> Injunctions of <HI>Re∣ligion</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> are, or ever can be contrary to <HI>right Reason,</HI> yet the <HI>common Reason</HI> of Man stands in Need of <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Help</HI> from <HI>Heaven,</HI> for attaining the <HI>true</HI> Knowledge and Practice of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI>; as the great <HI>Lock</HI> acknow∣ledgeth, in the Quotations I have made from him in my fifth Chapter. Which <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Help</HI> from <HI>Heaven, is</HI> so far from being <HI>destruc∣tive</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="003985_0004_10036B506EB104A8"/>
or repugnant to <HI>Reason,</HI> that 'tis the <HI>di∣vine Spirit</HI> which <HI>enlightens</HI> and <HI>influences</HI> the <HI>noble</HI> Faculty of <HI>Reason,</HI> to the higest Pitch of Knowledge and Certainty in heavenly Things, and gives it the greatest Repose, Delight and Satisfaction: Nevertheless, Reason and the Spirit of God remain always, two several Powers and Principles in Man, of different and distinct Natures, the one <HI>Humane</HI> and the other <HI>Divine.</HI> And what <HI>Lock</HI> says of <HI>Revelation,</HI> as contained in the Scripture, <HI>viz.</HI> that
<Q>many are beholden to Revelation, who do not ac∣knowledge it.</Q>
<HI>Vol.</HI> ii. <HI>Fol.</HI> 535. May as truly be said of the Light and Influence of the <HI>di∣vine Spirit</HI> in the Hearts of Men.</P>
<P>For Men sometimes finding clear Discoveries of God in their Minds, and of their Duty to him on the one Hand; and of the Darkness, Impurity and Unpreparedness of their own Hearts for his Service, on the other Hand; are apt to impute those Discoveries to the Light and Activity of their own Reason; or not to acknowledge that they are beholden to the immediate Revelation of God's Spirit within them for such Discoveries; when one would think nothing in it self can be clearer, than that Darkness cannot give Light for the Dis∣covery
<PB N="vi" REF="003985_0005_10036B52538EED70"/>
of it self: <HI>For whatsoever doth make manifest is Light</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Eph. v. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Reason corrupted and depraved by vicious Habits, cannot discover the Corruption and Depravity of it self, without Light from Hea∣ven, gives it such Sight; much less can it with∣out such Help know God and divine Things.
<Q>It was all purely the Work of Grace (says the great <HI>Lock</HI>) for they were all dead in Tres∣passes, and Sins, and could do nothing, not make one Step or the least Motion towards it— 'tis God here (says he) does all by Revelation, of what they could never dis∣cover by their own natural Faculties — and being thus quickened by the Spirit (says he) may as Men alive, work if they will. <BIBL><HI>Vol.</HI> iii. <HI>Fol.</HI> 359.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>To deny Men the Influences of the divine Spirit, is to leave them without God in the World. To say the Light of humane Reason without Light from any Thing above it, is the Light of God's Spirit, or the only Light that is in Man, is to take one of the most effectual Courses that can be, to overturn the Christian Religion, which is founded on divine Revelation, and can only be savingly understood
<PB N="vii" REF="003985_0006_10036B553B6CB138"/>
and practised by the Influence of the same Spirit which gave it Being. It casts a very ill Aspect on Devotion, and directly and unavoida∣bly tends to render all Addresses to God, for Light and Help from him ridiculous and in∣significant: For if we our selves without any immediate Influence and Aid from him, are able by the Exercise of our own natural Powers and Faculties, to know and practise our whole Duty, to what Purpose do we ask Light and Aid from him?</P>
<P>This Scheme tends to take off all Depen∣dance upon God, and the Light and Tuition of his holy Spirit, for Understanding and Strength; and to bring Men to depend on themselves and their own Sufficiency; the fatal Conse∣quence of which too much appears in the World already, in the loose and vicious Lives of Men; and is too likely to appear in a greater Degree, unless Men can be perswaded to for∣sake the evil Ways of their own Hearts, ad∣dress themselves to God, and depend upon, and become Subject to the Light and Power of his good Spirit in their own Souls.</P>
<P>It was therefore my principal Design in the following Undertaking, to set before the Eyes of Men, and make it as plain to them as pos∣sibly I could, that the Light of their Spirit
<PB N="viii" REF="003985_0007_10036B582BA46CA0"/>
and of God's Spirit are of different and distinct Natures and Kinds. That their own natural Powers and Faculties alone are not adequate for attaining to the Knowledge and Practice of true Piety and Religion; and that therefore they must apply themselves to God for Light and Help from Heaven, who is ready to <HI>shine into their Hearts</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iv, 6.</NOTE>, and to <HI>work in them, to will and to do of his own good Pleasure</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 12.13.</NOTE>, if they will but withdraw their Hearts from this World and turn them to him, that he may purge them from evil, and dispose them to Virtue and the Love of Himself; and prepare them for such divine Sensations of his Goodness, as will fill them with inconceiveable Delights, <HI>with Joys unspeakable and full of Glory</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 8.</NOTE> In Comparison of which all the Pleasures of this World are Nullities and Vanity.</P>
<P>I shall only add, that on the various Subjects treated of in the following Pages, I have en∣deavoured, according to the best Light I had, to speak of them, as clearly and distinctly as I could (which is all that can be expected from me) that the Reader might form, with as much Ease as possible, right Idea's thereof; and from thence take Occasion, if he shall be piously and religiously inclined, to make Tryal of the
<PB N="ix" REF="003985_0008_10034F2B37F8B858"/>
inward Ways of Virtue and <HI>taste and see that the Lord is good and gracious</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psa. xxxiv. 8. 1 Pet. ii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>May it please Almighty God to make this small Tract of such Use to some Souls, and I shall think it Satisfaction enough for all my Labour and Pains therein. To that End I commend my Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Conduct and Gui∣dance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his Good and Holy Spirit.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY Concerning the Restoration of Primitive Christianity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Reason and Design of Piety and Re∣ligion.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing more becoming ra∣tional Creatures, than an early and con∣stant Consideration of the Cause and Design of their Being; how they came to have Exist∣ence in this World, and for what End.</P>
<P>It is preposterous to think that our Existence was the Effect of meer Chance and Accident. The wonderful Order and Contrivance of the Parts, of which Man and the whole World of Beings are constituted; and the Support and Subsistence of such an innumerable Company of Beings, in such Beauty and Har∣mony, as is evidently maintained in the Uni∣verse; prove nothing less, than, that the same
<PB N="2" REF="003985_0011_10036B60F8FFFAE0"/>
is the Effect and Design, of incomprehensible Wisdom. So that it seems impossible for any Man who gives himself the Liberty of think∣ing, to doubt the Existence of a Being who made, and sustains, such an infinite Number of Creatures: Which Being we justly call Almighty God. So that hence the Cause of our Being is clearly manifest.</P>
<P>The next thing to be considered, is, what we may reasonably conclude, this infinitely wise, and Almighty Being, designed in the Production of Mankind.</P>
<P>Can it reasonably be thought, that he in∣tended any thing less than their Felicity ac∣cording to their several Capacities, as well as his own Glory? That Man whom he hath made the noblest of all his Creatures, here on Earth, endowed with reason and Under∣standing, was not in an especial Manner, de∣signed to be a Partaker of the Fruition, and Felicity of his Maker?</P>
<P>That, <HI>Man,</HI> as to his Body, is provided for in a Degree above the Beasts of the Field, the Fowls of the Air, the Fishes of the Sea, and all other animate Beings, who have the Life of Sensation, whom they all fear in Virtue of the natural Dominion God hath given him over them, will, I doubt not, be readily agreed; and that he consists of Body and Soul, an out∣ward and an inward Man, endowed with pro∣per
<PB N="3" REF="003985_0012_10036B66360091D8"/>
Senses adapted to the Knowledge of Things external and visible; and a Mind, Soul, or intellectual Spirit, with inward Senses, suited and adapted to the Preception and Enjoy∣ment of internal and spiritual Objects, is evi∣dent: For the Accommodation and Felicity whereof, 'tis most reasonable to believe, that God in his infinite Goodness hath made plen∣tiful Provision.</P>
<P>For can it be thought that the infinite and gracious God, should make less Provision for our Souls, than for our Bodies; that he who hath so richly provided, for our outward Man, should neglect the better and nobler Part of us, our Souls? that He who has provided a beautiful External World for the Pleasure and Entertainment of the Senses of our outward Man, should not also have provided, a much more beautiful and glorious World, for the Pleasure and Entertainment of the superiour Senses of our Inward Man?</P>
<P>For as the Senses of the inward Man, must needs be as much more excellent than those of the outward Man, as the inward Man is more excellent than the outward; so conse∣quently, must the Objects of Sensation of the former be much more excellent than the Objects of Sensation of the latter.</P>
<P>These Considerations afford a solid Foun∣dation, for a noble Pursuit of true Religion,
<PB N="4" REF="003985_0013_10034F32B58074F8"/>
and the attaining the Knowledge, of the things of the heavenly Kingdom; for when Men are fully perswaded, that they have in∣ward Senses suited and adapted to the Know∣ledge of God, and Enjoyment of him, they will not (if they consult their own Interest) set their Hearts on the short lived Pleasures, and Enjoyments of this World, which we every Day see to be exceeding transitory and uncertain; but being as it were loose and in∣different, as to the Things of this Life, will ardently seek a divine Sensation, of the Plea∣sures and Enioyments of the spiritual Kingdom, called in the sacred Writings, <HI>The Kingdom of God</HI>; which will afford them more satisfaction and delight, than, the Encrease of the Corn, Wine, and Oyle, of the Earth can do.</P>
<P>We are to be here but a very little Time, and 'tis hard to think that, that noble and excel∣lent Part of us our Souls or inward Man, en∣dowed with such wonderful and extensive Capacities, which nothing less than the Knowledge and Enjoyment of God himself can truly and compleatly satisfy, will be dis∣solved with our Bodies; tho' were it to be so, which is entirely irrational to think, from the nature of Things; yet a Life in this World, in which, those noble Powers and Faculties of the Soul, are enlightened and actuated by the Divine Spirit, and brought
<PB N="5" REF="003985_0014_10034F6CDFC6DF58"/>
into a real Sensation, of the Things of the <HI>heavenly Kingdom,</HI> whereby our evil Incli∣nations and Passions, which give us so much uneasiness, while they are predominant, would be brought under and mortified; and the Love of God and our Neighbour, a quiet and serene Mind and Conscience, one of the greatest Blessings on Earth, will naturally ensue; such a Life cannot but be the most desireable and delightful. And therefore it may very well be said, that, <HI>Godliness has the Promise of the Life that now is,</HI> as well as, <HI>of that which is to come</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It hath been too much, more is the pity, the Design of a Generation of Men, who have called themselves God's Priests or Ministers, among Heathens, Mahometans, Jews, and Christians, to render Religion very mysterious, and thereby themselves more necessary, than there is just Occasion for; which they have improved to the accumulating the Power, and Riches of this World to themselves; to the great scandal and Damage of true Religion; and to the exceeding Discouragement of the Pursuit of divine Knowledge, and a true Sense of God and Goodness, among Mankind. Erecting a Dominion over the Consciences of the Laity, and dealing out to them such
<PB N="6" REF="003985_0015_10036B6A756E0A20"/>
<HI>Creeds</HI> and <HI>Systems</HI> of Religion as they thought fit, in the several Parts of the World where they had Power, which the unthinking Part of Mankind have been obliged to receive, on peril of the Loss of the Good Things of this Life, and as far as in them lay Damna∣tion in the Life which is to come.</P>
<P>Tho' at the same Time nothing can well be plainer, than, that the Knowledge of the Christian Religion, is adapted to Men of in∣feriour, as well as superiour Capacities, the Souls of the former, being as precious in the Eyes of God, and as capable of enjoying him, as the latter. And therefore it is, that as God affords Mankind, an <HI>external Luminary,</HI> the Sun in the Firmament for their Bodies, by which Medium Men may see the Things of this World, without the Help of the Magi∣strate; So he also in his great Mercy affords, an <HI>internal</HI> Luminary, <HI>The Sun of Righteous∣ness,</HI> for their Minds; whereby Men may see the Things of God, and of the World to come, without the Help of Ministers.</P>
<P>It is true that the Ministers of Religion, themselves, being turned to God, have been, and still are of great Use, in turning People to this <HI>Light of God</HI> in their Souls; advising them to open their inward Eyes to it, and to walk therein; that they may know and understand for themselves; and feel in them∣selves
<PB N="7" REF="003985_0016_10036B6C024884B8"/>
the blessed and divine Sensations, of <HI>God in Christ reconciling them to himself</HI>; and taste of the Sweetness and Love of God, in turning from Darkness, from Ignorance, and evil Works; exhorting them to exercise those noble Powers and Faculties of their Souls, under the Influence of the divine Spirit, in their own Hearts; whereby they may come to know the Will, Mind, and Law of God, to themselves, and not p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n their Faith upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny Man, Councils or Synods of Men, but only upon the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and the <HI>Sacred Scripture,</HI> which proceeded from it. And they who have the Benefit of this Holy Writing, which was wrote by <HI>the Movings of the Holy Ghost</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. i 21.</NOTE>, will by the same Spirit, if they du∣ly apply to it, come to understand so much of the Scripture as is necessary for their Salva∣tion.</P>
<P>It was about 2400 Years after the Crea∣tion of the World, before Mankind had any external written Law, for the Rule and Con∣duct of their Lives, so far as appears by either sacred or prophane History; in all which Time Mankind, generally speaking, had only for their Rule of Faith and Manners the <HI>exter∣nal Creation</HI> as a Monitor to their outward Senses, for Evidence of the Reality and Cer∣tainty
<PB N="8" REF="003985_0017_10036B6EC86959D0"/>
of the Existence of the Supreme Being; and the <HI>internal Impressions,</HI> God by his di∣vine Spirit made upon the Capacities and Powers of their Souls, or inward Man; and perhaps some of them oral Traditions deliver∣ed from Father to Son.</P>
<P>'The Love and Favour' (says the memo∣rable <HI>John Hales</HI> in his Golden Remains pa. 1)
<Q>which it pleased God to bear our Fathers before the Law, so far prevailed with him, as that without any Books and Writings, by familiar and friendly convers∣ing with them and communicating himself unto them, he made them receive and under∣stand his Laws: Their inward Conceits and intellectuals being after a wonderful Manner, as it were, <HI>figur'd</HI> and <HI>charecter'd</HI> (as St. <HI>Basil</HI> expresses it) by his Spirit, so that they could not but see, and consent un∣to, and confess the Truth of them. Which Way of Manifesting his Will, unto many other gracious Priviledges which it had, above that which in after Ages came in Place of it, had this added, that it brought with it unto the Man, to whom it was made, a Preservation against all Doubt and Hesitancy, and a full Assurance, both who the Author was, and how far his intent and Mean∣ing reach'd. We that are their Off-spring ought, as St. <HI>Chrysostom</HI> tells us, so to have
<PB N="9" REF="003985_0018_10036B704F8FF2A0"/>
demeaned our selves, that it might have been with us as it was with them, that we might have had no need of writing, no other <HI>Teacher</HI> but the <HI>Spirit,</HI> no other <HI>Books</HI> but our <HI>Hearts,</HI> no other Means to have been taught the Things of God.</Q></P>
<P>And then when God, because of the <HI>Trans∣gressions of the Jews,</HI> committed his Will to writing in Tables of Stone on Mount <HI>Sinai, un∣til the Seed</HI> (Christ) <HI>should come</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 19.</NOTE>, who were but a very small Part of Mankind, and after∣wards inhabited but a small Tract of Land, at the Head of the <HI>Mediteranean</HI> Sea; the rest of Mankind, were still left to the same Means for their Conduct and Behaviour, as they had before.</P>
<P>And tho' God added to the Seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> an <HI>external</HI> written Law, yet 'tis inconsistent with His Goodness, to think that the other Means, which He then afforded the rest of Mankind, which was the <HI>only</HI> Means that all the World had before, to know and do his Will, were not <HI>sufficient,</HI> for their pleasing <HI>Him,</HI> and <HI>being happy</HI>; especially if we con∣sider, that the <HI>Ten Commandments,</HI> contained in the two Tables of Stone, brought down by <HI>Moses</HI> from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> are but a kind of Transcript of the moral Duties, wrote by the

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Necessity of divine Illumination, and that the Light and Operation of God's Spirit, and the Light and Operation of Man's Spirit are different, and distinguished the one from the other.</HEAD>
<P>IT will I doubt not be readily agreed, that the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God and the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Man, must needs be different and distinct in Nature and Essence. The <HI>divine</HI> Spirit and Wisdom of God, and the <HI>humane</HI> Reason of Man must needs be of different Kinds and Natures; otherwise the Soul of Man would be God, of the same Essence with Him, and not a Creature, but Almighty, omnipresent, and omniscient; for so with∣out Controversy God is; else He could not produce such an innumerable Company of Beings and Creatures, as are contained in the Universe, preserve them in that admira∣ble Beauty and Harmony they are in, and provide for all Events, as 'tis manifest he
<PB N="21" REF="003985_0030_10034F42980E43A0"/>
doth, to the Wonder and Amazement of Men; which Man is utterly uncapable of. And therefore the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Wisdom</HI> of God, and the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> of Man, are infi∣nitely different in their Powers and Natures. And then, that the Light and Operation of each of these Spirits or Powers, must needs also be of different Kinds and Natures, ac∣cording to the Principles from which they flow, I think unavoidably follows. This I take to be exceeding clear from the Reason and Nature of Things, and the same is not less manifest from the Holy Scriptures.</P>
<P>For God said, <HI>My Spirit shall not always strive with Man</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. vi. 3.</NOTE>. If God's Spirit and Man's Spirit had been of the same Kind and Nature in their Light and Operation, there could not have been a strife between them.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Levites</HI> acknowledging of God's Goodness to the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> they said unto him, <HI>Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Nehe. ix. 20.</NOTE>. So that their <HI>Spirit</HI> had need of Instruction from God's <HI>Spirit,</HI> and therefore they appear to be two distinct Spirits in their Light and Operations.</P>
<P><HI>The Spirit it self beareth witness without Spirit, that we are the Children of God</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Rom. vlii. 16.</NOTE>. The Apostle is here speaking, of the Evidence and Testi∣mony
<PB N="22" REF="003985_0031_10036B9A2E22AF28"/>
of the Spirit of God, to the Spirit of the Sons of God, that they are <HI>His</HI>; so that the Spirit of God, and the Spirit even of the Sons of God, the Spirit of Men born again, appear to be Distinct Beings and Spirits, and to be contradistinguished in their Light and Operations.</P>
<P><HI>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, neither have entered into the Heart of Man the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him: But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 9, 20.</NOTE>. 'Tis evident, by the Insufficiency of the Heart or Soul of Man to discover Gods Kindness, and Will to them who love him, without the Help or Revelation of God's Spirit, that they are distinct Spirits and have different Light and Operation.</P>
<P>And in the very next Verse we have the Apostles Reason, <HI>For what Man knoweth the Things of a Man, save the Spirit of Man, which is in him; even so the Things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God.</HI> A clearer Di∣stinction between God's Spirit and Man's Spirit, in their several Lights and Operations cannot possibly be made. Here is see forth the absolute Necessity of the Divine Illumination of God's Spirit, to enligthen Man's Spirit in order to his Knowledge of the Things of God.

<P>Then as to the Ministeries of the Prophets, in their Days the common Phrase among them was, <HI>The Word of the Lord came unto me saying.</HI> Now this was the Voice and Speech of God's Spirit, to their Spirits; for <HI>the Prophecy came not in old Time,</HI> (or <HI>at any Time,</HI> as the Margin reads it) <HI>by the Will of Man</HI> (or Man's Spirit) <HI>but holy Men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. i. 21</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>The Word of the Lord</HI> (says <HI>Ezekiel) came un∣to me saying, Son of Man prophesy, against the Prophets of</HI> Israel, <HI>that prophesy, and say thou unto them that Prophesy out of their own Hearts</HI>; (such as made Discourses without divine In∣spiration) <HI>Hear ye the Word of the Lord, Thus saith the Lord God, Wo unto the Foolish Pro∣phets that follow their own Spirit and have seen nothing (i. e.</HI> from God) or as the Mar∣gin reads it, <HI>and Things which they have not seen (i. e.</HI> from God) <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Eze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. xiii. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>.

<P>The ingenious <HI>Monro,</HI> Vicar of <HI>Letter Ken∣ney</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the second Edition, of his <HI>Just Measures, of the pious In∣sitution of Youth,</HI> hath among many others of like Import, the following remarkable Passa∣ges on these Subjects.</P>
<Q><HI>Divine</HI> Things, says he, before we can discover their Beauty or feel their Efficacy, must be seen in a <HI>divine Light.</HI> The natu∣ral Man saith St. <HI>Paul</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 14.</NOTE>, that is, he that hath nothing in him, but his corrupted Reason and Faculties, and the Shadow, and oftentimes false Light, that the Exercise of these affords; cannot <HI>know,</HI> the <HI>Things of the Spirit of God</HI>; Know them <HI>speculatively</HI> and <HI>notionally</HI> as the <HI>Devils</HI> do, he may; but know them <HI>divinely,</HI> so as to be <HI>trans∣formed</HI> by them, and <HI>conformed</HI> to them, he cannot; the Reason is plain, <HI>Because they are spiritually discerned</HI>; that is, they are truly and Savingly knewn, by the <HI>Illu∣mination</HI> of the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> only. <BIBL><HI>Part.</HI> 2d. <HI>Pa.</HI> 331.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>For it is certain, says he, that all true Christians in every Age, are <HI>anointed</HI> with the <HI>same Spirit,</HI> that the <HI>Holy Jesus</HI> himself
<PB N="45" REF="003985_0054_10036BD8A8F415C8"/>
was, otherwise they are not <HI>true Christians.</HI> For the very Import of that worthy Name is to be <HI>anointed,</HI> that is to be led, taught, governed and sanctified, by the <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI></Q>
<Q><HI>If any Man, saith St.</HI> Paul <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 9.</NOTE>, <HI>hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His</HI>; besides I would fain ask those who deny that any other <HI>Light</HI> is necessary in order to know <HI>God</HI> and divine Things, <HI>savingly,</HI> but that of <HI>Reason,</HI> assisted by outward Revelation, what tolerable Sense they will put on the devout and ardent Breathings of the Psal∣mist <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal cxix.</NOTE> <HI>Open mine Eyes, teach me thy Sta∣tutes, give me Understanding,</HI> and the like, which he repeats at every turn? To be sure the Psalmist, had as great and as many Advantages, as others can pretend to; he had the Benefit of a <HI>written Law,</HI> and the <HI>Ministry</HI> of <HI>extraordinary</HI> Prophets, and no doubt had as good <HI>natural Faculties</HI> as his Neighbours; and yet he saw the Necessity of another <HI>Light,</HI> in order to be divinely instructed, <BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> 332.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>When we have listened unto, says he, and complyed with the <HI>inward Calls</HI> and <HI>Motions</HI> (of the Spirit,) He (God) comes and takes Possession of <HI>us,</HI> and dwells in us, as in his living Temples: And then it is,
<PB N="46" REF="003985_0055_10036BDA311C7AB0"/>
that we are <HI>divinely illuminated and taught</HI> <BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> 335.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>For the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> says he, cannot dwell in unholy Hearts; he may indeed and actu∣ally doth <HI>visit</HI> wicked Men, with the gra∣cious Designs of a wakening them out of their sinful Slumbers; urging and importu∣ning them to their Duties, and assisting in the Discharge of them; but take up his Residence in them, and abide with them, he cannot. <HI>For what Fellowship can Light have with Darkness</HI>? How incongruous, as well as impossible is it, that the Spirit of Purity and Joy, of Love and Peace, of Uni∣ty and Harmony, of Sweetness and Benig∣nity, should be strictly united to, familiarly converse with, and constantly dwell in Souls, that are sensual and earthly wrathful and furious, revengeful and malicious, jarring and uneasy Souls, disordered and melanchol∣ly; these Things are contrary the one to the other, and cannot possibly sort together. <BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> 336.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>Neither, says he, can we hear the Voice of the Holy Spirit, nor receive any Profit from his loving Care, to instruct us, as long as our Minds are distracted, and our Atten∣tion diverted, by the Cares and Concerns of the World, by the Tumults of our un∣ruly Passions, by inordinately pleasing our
<PB N="47" REF="003985_0056_10036BDCEB8AA310"/>
Sensuality, and indulging our selves the Li∣berty of Speculating vainly. His gentle Voice is heard only <HI>in silence,</HI> and recollecti∣on, when the Mind is serious and undisturb∣ed, our Passions hushed and the World seclud∣ed. <BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> 340, 341.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>The Holy Spirit, says he, speaks <HI>inwardly</HI> and <HI>immediately</HI> to the Soul; <HI>for God is a Spirit; the Soul is a Spirit</HI> and they con∣verse with one another in <HI>Spirit</HI>; not by Words, but by spiritual Notions, which however are more intelligible than the most eloquent Strains in the World. God makes himself to be heard by the Soul, by inward Motions, which it perceives and compre∣hends proportionably, as it is voided and emptied of earthly Ideas; and the more the Faculties of the Soul cease their own Operations, so much the more sensible and more intelligible are the <HI>Motions</HI> of God to it. These <HI>immediate Communications</HI> of God with the Souls of Men are denyed and de∣rided by a great many; but that the <HI>Fa∣ther of Spirits</HI> should have no converse with our Spirits, but by the Intervention, <HI>only</HI> of outward and foreign Objects, may justly seem strange; especially when we are so often told in holy Scripture, that we are the <HI>Temples of the Holy Ghost,</HI> and that <HI>God dwells</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good Men: And why the
<PB N="48" REF="003985_0057_10036BE3D1C98EF0"/>
Holy Spirit's speaking, <HI>inwardly</HI> to the Souls of Men, His <HI>Illuminating,</HI> teaching and work∣ing in them <HI>immediately,</HI> should be treated in ridicule, and be made a Subject of Drol∣lery and J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, I know no Reason, but that Men are so sunk into Earthliness and Carnality, that they have quite lost all Sense and Re∣lish of <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>spiritual</HI> Things, and therefore think fit to deny, what by Rea∣son, of their Indisposition, and Listlesness, they can have no Experience of.</Q>
<Q>But that our Thoughts, says he of this important Particular may be distinct and clear, we must consider that the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> speaks to two Sorts of Persons, 1st, to such as are in a State of <HI>Sin and Impenitency</HI>: These he solicites and importunes to return by <HI>in∣ward Motions</HI> and <HI>Impressions,</HI> by suggesting good Thoughts, and prompting to pious Re∣solutions, by Checks and Controuls, by Con∣viction of Sin and Duty; sometimes by Frights and Terrors, and other whiles by Love and Endearments. Thus he is said to <HI>stand at the Door and knock</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 20.</NOTE>, and when any by the Strength wherewith he hath <HI>already inspired them,</HI> do sincerely abandon and forsake their Sins, turn to <HI>God,</HI> and abso∣lutely resign themselves to His Conduct and
<PB N="49" REF="003985_0058_10036BE8D0170C90"/>
Operations, then they are said to <HI>hear His Voice,</HI> and <HI>open the Door,</HI> and accordingly He enters in, and takes Possession of them; and if they continue faithful to him, and do not <HI>return again to folly</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxv. 8.</NOTE>, He will continue to carry on to Perfection, that which He hath graciously begun. On the other Hand, when, notwithstanding all His loving Soli∣citations, Men do still cherish and cleave to their Lusts, and presevere in a State of Sin, they are then said to <HI>resist the Holy Ghost</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Acts vii. 51.</NOTE> whereby their Condition becomes very de∣plorable and their Conversion very difficult; for the more Men resist the Importunities, and stifle the <HI>Motions</HI> of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> the stronger do the Chains of their Corruption and Servitude become. Every new Act of Sin gives it a Degree of Strength, and con∣sequently puts a new Obstacle in the Way of Conversion; and when Sin is turned in∣to an inveterate and rooted Habit (which by reiterated Commissions and long Con∣tinuance it is) then it becomes <HI>a Nature,</HI> and is as difficultly alter'd as nature is. <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his Colour? Or the Leo∣pard his Spots? Then may you also do Good who are accustomed to do Evil</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. xiii. 23.</NOTE>. So that in this Case the Conversion of Men becomes
<PB N="50" REF="003985_0059_10036BEA58EF3978"/>
<HI>morally</HI> impossible; for though the Mercies and Graces of God do never fail, and tho' the Holy Spirit continues his Solicitations, yet when Men by a long and Wilful Con∣tinuance in Sin have so hardened themselves, that they become stupid and wholly insen∣sible to the divine Calls and Voice, then the Holy Spirit abandons them to their Conduct; <HI>but my People saith God</HI> by the royal Prophet, <HI>would not hearken to my Voice,</HI> and <HI>Israel would none of me; so I gave them up to their own Hearts Lusts, and they walked in their own Counsels</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxxi. 11 12.</NOTE>.</Q>
<Q>This weighty Consideration should oblige Parents with all possible Seriousness, to recommend to their Children, that they fail not betimes to listen to the Calls and Voice of the Holy Spirit, and that they be infinitely tender of resisting His gracious Im∣portunities.</Q>
<Q>This good Spirit begins very soon to at∣tack young Hearts, that he may win them to the Love of God, and engage them to <HI>Remember their Creator in the Days of their Youth.</HI> And oh happy! Yea thrice happy, they who comply with these early Motions, and who do not listen to the sly and cunning Insinuations of a tempting Devil, a flatter∣ing

World, and deceiving Flesh! Oh how easie and delightful would <HI>Conversion</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Obedience</HI> of his Commands be, if we gave ear to the <HI>first Calls</HI> of the divine Grace and did set about the Work of our Salvation, while our Hearts are tender, and <HI>flexible,</HI> and before we have contracted <HI>vi∣cious Habits</HI>; whereas, if we neglect an I delay it, and follow the Swing of corrupt Na∣ture, and the Conduct of the wicked World, and listen to the fallacious Proposals of the great Enemy of our Souls; as our Conver∣sion will become extreamly difficult, yea, and next to impossible, so if ever we shall be prevailed with heartily to engage in it, it will be infallibly attended with most piercing Sorrows and Agonies, with Fears, and Anxieties, Horrors and Tremblings, with Doubts and Uncertainties, and a Thousand other racking and bitter Ingre∣dients.</Q>

<Q>The <HI>Soul,</HI> says he, being thus <HI>raised up</HI> from the <HI>Death</HI> of Sin, and <HI>born again,</HI> is <HI>divinely</HI> animated, and discovers that it is alive by the <HI>vital Operations</HI> which it per∣forms, and by the due Exercise of his <HI>nobler</HI> Faculties, which are now awakened, and invigorated, and the <HI>Life</HI> which it lives, in consequence of so blessed a <HI>Change,</HI> must be truly <HI>excellent</HI> and <HI>sublime.</HI> 'Tis this that I am in the next Place to evince, and the Truth of it will appear, if we consider, 1st.

If the former be of an <HI>excellent</HI> Nature and Quality. so must the latter be likewise.

have given thee living Water</HI> <NOTE N="¶¶" PLACE="foot">John iv. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> plainly let us see, that our <HI>devout</HI> Prayers and <HI>pious</HI> Importunities, are the <HI>Means</HI> of <HI>deriving</HI> the <HI>divine Life</HI> into our Souls.</Q>
<Q>The <HI>Excellency</HI> of this Life appears from the <HI>noble Principle</HI> that influences it; for <HI>a Life</HI> that owes all its <HI>vital Motions</HI> and <HI>Operations</HI> to a <HI>Principle</HI> that is <HI>heavenly,</HI> and <HI>sublime,</HI> cannot but be excellent, and will discover that it is so, by its <HI>Inclinations</HI> and Desires, by its <HI>Designs</HI> and Aims, by all its <HI>Actions,</HI> and Carriages, and by the <HI>secret</HI> Breathings and Tendencies of the inward Man, which certainly must be quite other than those which <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI> and <HI>Cor∣ruption,</HI> do inspire withal; for since they proceed from a <HI>noble Principle,</HI> they must consequently be of a higher and more ex∣cellent Strain. Now as to the <HI>Principle</HI> of that Life which the Regenerated do live, we are to observe, that the holy Scriptures use a great Variety of Expressions concern∣ing it; for it is represented sometimes by <HI>God's dwelling</HI> in them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vi. 16. 1 John iv. 12.</NOTE>; sometimes by <HI>Christ living</HI> in the Heart <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Gal. ii. 20.</NOTE>; at other Times, and very frequently, by <HI>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus,</HI> or <HI>the Holy Ghost inhabiting</HI> and influencing the

<HI>inner man</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 2, to 6, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>; Finally by the Emblem of <HI>Living Waters,</HI> springing up as a Well in the Soul <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">John. iv.</NOTE><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Joh. iv. 14.</NOTE>. The Result of all these different Ways of speaking amounts in short to this great and Important Truth; namely, that a certain <HI>intimate</HI> and <HI>operative Presence of God in the Soul,</HI> is that <HI>noble Principle</HI> of the new Life, which we are enquiring after. 'Tis this <HI>Presence</HI> that by it's mighty <HI>Energy,</HI> and <HI>divine</HI> Force, communicates a <HI>heavenly</HI> Vigour and Sprightliness unto the inward Man. 'Tis <HI>it</HI> that powerfully <HI>touches</HI> and <HI>moves</HI> our nobler Faculties, that not only <HI>dilates,</HI> and <HI>actuates</HI> our Capacities, but also <HI>delightfully</HI> entertains and satisfies them; for it is the <HI>Light</HI> of the Understanding, and the <HI>sovereign Good</HI> of the Will; it is the <HI>Love</HI> that ravishes, and the <HI>Fulness</HI> that allayes the eager Thirst of the Soul. We ought always when we have Occasion to consider or discourse of this Subject, care∣fully to remember, that the <HI>Soul</HI> of Man was originally designed <HI>to lodge the Deity,</HI> and that for that End it was endued with <HI>Capacities</HI> vastly great and large, and such as no created Object, nor even all the Crea∣tures together, do bear any Proportion un∣to, it being only an <HI>infinite Object,</HI> that can
<PB N="57" REF="003985_0066_10036C0035F6E930"/>
give <HI>entire</HI> Repose and Quiet to those <HI>bound∣ness</HI> Desires which we are conscious, do move and stir in our Bosoms. Now the blessed <HI>God,</HI> that <HI>infinitely perfect</HI> and most <HI>communicative</HI> Being, is this Object; and he is so, not meerly after an <HI>Ideal Manner,</HI> as when we employ our <HI>active Powers</HI> in the Contemplation of him and his Excellencies, in which Case 'tis not himself, but some shadowey and languid Pictures of him, some <HI>faint Resemblance</HI> of his Perfections, that are <HI>immediately</HI> presented to our Minds. But he is then the <HI>beautifying Object,</HI> when he is <HI>really</HI> and <HI>efficatiously</HI> present in the Soul; and manifests his being there by his <HI>divine Operations,</HI> and the <HI>gracious Commu∣nications</HI> which he makes of his Light, and Grace, and ineffable Joys. This <HI>blisful Pre∣sence,</HI> the Regenerate who are delivered from the <HI>Dominion,</HI> and cleansed from the <HI>Impurities</HI> of Sin, have recovered again, and it is on the Account of it, that they are said to be <HI>an Habitation of God through the Spirit, and the Temples of the Holy Ghost</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 22. 1 Cor. vi. 19.</NOTE> for that <HI>good Spirit</HI> takes <HI>Possession</HI> of them, resides in their <HI>Hearts,</HI> becomes the <HI>Mover, Enlightner,</HI> and <HI>Director</HI> of all their Facul∣ties and Powers, gives a <HI>new</HI> and <HI>heavenly</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="003985_0067_10036C01C0D666B8"/>
Tincture and Tendency to all their Incli∣nations and Desires, and in one Word, is the <HI>great Spring</HI> of all that they think, or do, or say; and hence it is that they are said to <HI>walk</HI> no more <HI>after the Flesh but after the Spirit,</HI> and to <HI>be led by the Spirit of God</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 1, 14.</NOTE>. Passages which intimate very plainly, that these happy Souls are not any more under the Conduct and Power of Corrup∣tion, nor acted by <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood,</HI> but that a <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>more excellent</HI> Principle animates, and influences them, even the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> who now is become <HI>dominant</HI> in the inward Man, and exerts his <HI>mighty Efficacies</HI> there, all Things that were inconsistent with his <HI>Presence</HI> and <HI>Operations,</HI> being removed and done away.</Q>
<Q>From what, says he, I have said on this Head, may appear <HI>the fundamental Reason</HI> why the Inspirations and Communications of the Holy Spirit ought not to be look'd on as Favours <HI>peculiar only</HI> to <HI>certain Persons,</HI> and to <HI>certain Times,</HI> but should be consider∣ed as <HI>common</HI> Blessings; for they are such, as were <HI>originally</HI> intended for all Mankind; and whereof all are capable by Virtue of their Creation, as having every one of them the <HI>Faculties</HI> and <HI>Powers,</HI> that are necessary

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Freedom and Liberty of Man regarding his Choise, of <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Evil,</HI> and of the sen∣sible and experimental Operations and Visitati∣ons of the Spirit of God in the Soul of <HI>Man.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE working and striving of God by his most blessed Spirit in the Souls of Men, in order to their <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation</HI> is not irresistable, but suited to Man's <HI>Rational Nature</HI> and <HI>Freedom</HI> of Choise and Action. For Man is not a <HI>necessary Agent</HI> (if I may so speak) but a <HI>free Agent</HI>; and therefore he is
<PB N="63" REF="003985_0072_10036C0F057C8A80"/>
an accountable Creature for his <HI>Conduct</HI> and <HI>Behaviour</HI> in this World; And for that Rea∣son becomes a proper Object of <HI>Rewerds</HI> and <HI>Punishments</HI> in the next Life, according as his Works have been in this.</P>
<P>For if we were <HI>necessary Agents,</HI> or <HI>Agents</HI> whose Actions were not free and voluntary of our own Choise, but we were forced irresista∣bly to Action, by an irrevocable Decree of the <HI>Almighty God,</HI> or by his preordination, we should be like <HI>meer Stocks</HI> or <HI>Stones,</HI> in his Hand, and move as the Orbs in the <HI>Planatary System</HI> do, without the least Liberty or Choise of Action; and therefore, should be entirely unaccountable for any and even all the <HI>base, irreligious</HI> and <HI>most inhuman Actions</HI> which we do or can do; and no Reward or Punishment could in Justice, or the Reason of Things, be due to us for any good or bad Actions.</P>
<P><HI>Religion</HI> would indeed then be what the <HI>Ir∣religious</HI> seem to desire it should be, viz. <HI>a meer Sham or Nullity.</HI></P>
<P>For to what Purpose, and how preposterous would it be, to call Men to <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Amendment of Life?</HI> When at the same Time they have no Need of <HI>Repentance,</HI> since they are all doing of his Will, and cannot help it; all obedient to his Preordination, because 'twas impossible for <HI>them</HI> to resist the irresista∣ble Force impelled upon them by the Al∣mighty.
<PB N="64" REF="003985_0073_10036C119C9517C8"/>
So that this <HI>Hypothesis</HI> in my Opinion, tends directly to an utter abolishing of the Notions of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Vice</HI> and to extirpate, the same out of the Minds of Mankind.</P>
<P>But Almighty God hath not impelled on us such an <HI>irresistable force</HI> to either <HI>bad or good Actions,</HI> as our own Experience, as well as the Reason of Things fully evince: For we feel he hath given us a <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Freedom</HI> to chuse or refuse good or evil Actions; to turn our Thoughts hither and thither, from one Ob∣ject to another, and change our Actions a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pleasure, so that whatsoever <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> we lost in <HI>Adam,</HI> regarding divine Things, we have regained by <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>True it is, <HI>Man</HI> considered in <HI>Adam</HI> in the Fall, abstractly, is a very <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>impotent Creature,</HI> regarding <HI>God</HI> and <HI>spiritual Things,</HI> and can do nothing in that Respect without Christ or his <HI>divine Help</HI>; but <HI>Man</HI> considered as the <HI>Purchase</HI> of the <HI>beloved Son of God,</HI> to whom as such he gives Light and Power; can by Virtue thereof, do all things necessary for plea∣sing and serving God <HI>acceptably.</HI> And therefore 'tis but reasonable, that we should account for our <HI>Actions</HI> to him, and receive a just Retri∣bution from him in a future State, according to our Works in this World, whether they shall be <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad</HI>; which the Revelations of the Will of God, contained in that holy
<PB N="65" REF="003985_0074_10036C170A9DA2D8"/>
Book the <HI>Bible,</HI> give a clear and evident Account of: So that there is nothing in this State of Tryal and Probation here, that Men ought to be more sollicitous about, than that of pleasing <HI>God</HI> in walking in his Ways, and doing of his Will and Commandments.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God</HI> also beareth Witness in the <HI>Hearts</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> to the Will of God, so plainly and experimentally, that I conceive it to be impossible for any sober Men, who re∣tire their Minds from the <HI>Creatures</HI> and <HI>Things</HI> without them, and empty their Souls of all earthly Ideas, and then fix and stay their <HI>Hearts</HI> and <HI>Thoughts</HI> on God, steadily waiting on him, and humbly walking with him, in a holy and dayly <HI>Self-denial</HI> and <HI>Cross</HI> to their <HI>carnal</HI> and <HI>sinful Appetites</HI> and <HI>Passions,</HI> which they have Power from Jesus Christ to do. I say, I take it to be impossible for <HI>Souls</HI> so disposed and given up to the Will of God, trusting in the <HI>Lord Jehovah,</HI> to miss or fall short of a Sense and Feeling in themselves, of the experimental Work and Evidence of <HI>God's Spirit</HI> in their <HI>Souls,</HI> to enlighten them in a sweet and blessed Manner concerning the Will of God, and what he requires of them; consonant to the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and witnessing to the <HI>Truths</HI> contained in the <HI>Bible,</HI> as coming from God, through his <HI>Inspiration</HI> of those holy Men who speak them.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="003985_0075_10036C189C3C60D8"/>And such Men so turned to God, and <HI>enlight∣ned</HI> by him, cannot fail of feeling in their Hearts a being <HI>quickned</HI> and <HI>strengthned</HI> to <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>pious Actions,</HI> to live <HI>soberly, righteously</HI> and <HI>Godly</HI> in this World: In such Souls an <HI>Ab∣horrence</HI> is begot to vile and evil Actions. as a Shame to human Nature, as well as an Offence to God, as an unmanly and brutal Course of Life, and therefore very displeasing to God, who made us Men, that we should live like Men, and act becoming <HI>rational Creatures,</HI> and not like brute Beasts, below our <HI>rational Nature, but</HI> behaving our selves to our own Honour as well as His.</P>
<P>For every <HI>evil</HI> and <HI>sinful Act</HI> is an <HI>irrational Act</HI>; every excessive and disorderly Appetite and Passion is a marring and abusing the Man who gives Way to it, bringing Shame upon him in the Opinion of others, and which he cannot but be ashamed of himself when he thinks like a Man, when he retrospects on his Actions and reflects as becomes a <HI>rational Creature.</HI> The Apostle might therefore very well ask <HI>enlightned and quickened Souls, What Fruit</HI> (or Profit) <HI>had you then in those Things whereof you are now ashamed</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 21.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>And where is even the earthly minded Man, that at some Time or other doth not meet with a <HI>Visitation</HI> of God within his own <HI>Soul,</HI> though unsought after by him; that sets his Sins in order before him, and pricks him to the very Heart for the same?

<P>But if Men will not be so gathered, if they will have their own ways, and not God's Ways; for they have their Choice, then their Souls will become <HI>desolate,</HI> and their <HI>Condem∣nation</HI> will be <HI>just, for this</HI> (said our Saviour) <HI>is the Condemnation, that Light is come into the World</HI> (into the Hearts of sensual, sinful and worldly minded Men) <HI>but Men</HI> (such brutal Men) <HI>love Darkness</HI> (their dark and wicked Ways) <HI>rather than Light,</HI> (than the Light of

<P>Until therefore this <HI>Light</HI> of God in the <HI>Soul,</HI> is come to by Men, its coming to them, is not like to reform them.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Of Reason.</HI></HEAD>
<P>REASON that noble Power and Faculty of the Soul of Man, which suits or adapts him for the Knowledge of things humane, and divine, must have the Regards paid, which are due to it. For tho' it is not sufficient of it self, to give Man the sav∣ing Knowledge of God, and of Things which are heavenly; yet without it, it does not ap∣pear how that Knowledge can be conveyed to us, by the Light and Operation of the di∣vine Spirit: Or how Man could know God without <HI>that Faculty,</HI> any <HI>more</HI> than he can, without, <HI>this supernatural Agent.</HI> 'Tis on Man's Spirit that God's Spirit works, to make him a new Creature, a Child of God, and Heir of Heaven. And tho' the Discoveries which the divine Spirit makes of Religion and the Things of God, are more sublime, than Man's Reason could have made; yet are they not, when they shine in upon the Understand∣ing, dissonant or repugnant to it: For there is an excellent Harmony in well disposed
<PB N="72" REF="003985_0081_10036C2CADE5FC18"/>
Minds, between the Dictates of Heaven and right Reason.</P>
<P>Reason is given us by our bountiful Ma∣ker, not only for transacting the Affairs of this Life, but to distinguish between what comes from God, as his Will, to be done by us on Earth, in order to Happiness in Heaven; and the Wiles of Satan, as well as the Ima∣ginations and Inventions of Men in Religion, let their Pretences be never so specious, in which they seek themselves, and to impose upon us, for their own Honour or Interest.</P>
<P>We may rest assured, that nothing comes from God, but what is worthy of him, and becomes his infinite Wisdom and Majesty; and that as the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> is a <HI>reasonable Service</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 1.</NOTE>, so all things which are pretended to belong to it, and are Opposite to Reason, are not Injunctions of so excellent a Religion, or Dictates of the divine Spirit.</P>
<P>The sacred Scripture, contains an undoubt∣ed Revelation of God's Will evidently con∣sonant to right Reason; and all Pretensions to divine Authority from God must be sub∣jected to that excellent Test, or Touchstone, as what God will never speak contrary to. For Reason cannot be of one side the Question and Truth on the other. Men who are sent by,
<PB N="73" REF="003985_0082_10036C2E33FFDFD8"/>
and subject to Heaven, will neither say or do, Things contrary to the Mind of Hea∣ven. They will not misuse their Vocation, and reproach their Master, by avouching that <HI>he saith</HI>; when 'tis their own Imaginations <HI>that speak:</HI> They will be humble and modest: Much less will they in God's Name, utter Falshoods, or erroneous Doctrines repugnant to Scripture, or right Reason.</P>

<P><HI>Mental Devotion,</HI> is that which is <HI>trans∣acted</HI> in the <HI>hidden Man</HI> of the Heart, and it comprehends not only the <HI>silent, vehement</HI> Pantings of the Soul after God, but also the <HI>secret Manifestations</HI> that God makes of him∣self unto the Soul; for it is in both these to∣gether, that the <HI>spiritual and holy Intercourse</HI> that is between God and pure Minds doth consist. Of this <HI>internal Devotion</HI> there are <HI>two Sorts</HI>; which I shall briefly consider; the <HI>first</HI> is, when one imploys or exercises his

<HI>Faculties,</HI> that is, his <HI>Understanding, Will</HI> and <HI>Desire</HI> in the <HI>Contemplation, Love</HI> and <HI>Adoration</HI> of the <HI>Beauties</HI> and <HI>Perfections</HI> of God, and in aspiring after his gracious <HI>Communications,</HI> and <HI>Conformity</HI> to his holy Will and Nature. Here the Soul is <HI>active,</HI> and <HI>particular</HI>; sometimes it <HI>views</HI> one Per∣fection, sometimes another. It <HI>contemplates</HI> God in his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Works,</HI> and <HI>Providen∣ces.</HI> And According to the several <HI>Views</HI> it bath of Him, it <HI>forms</HI> several and distinct <HI>Acts</HI>; such as of <HI>Faith,</HI> of <HI>Love,</HI> of <HI>Hope,</HI> of <HI>Gratitude, Humility</HI> and the like; taking Occasion from every Thing of making de∣vout <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies</HI> and <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons,</HI> of which I have given Instances in the Beginning of this Chapter.</P>
<P>The other Sort is, when the devout Soul, being <HI>disengaged</HI> from all created Things; from Sin, and Self, and Corruption, and <HI>firmly believing</HI> that God, who <HI>filleth all Things, is present</HI> in the Soul, and <HI>ready</HI> to display his Power, and communicate his Light and Graces, doth by an <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> state him∣self in his <HI>Presence,</HI> and there having <HI>turn'd</HI> the <HI>Eye</HI> of the Soul to the <HI>Interiour,</HI> and made an <HI>intire Surrender</HI> of himself into the Hands of God, with an <HI>humble Desire,</HI> that he would dispose of him as be pleases, and that his holy Will may be done in him; he

continues in a <HI>profound Silence</HI> and <HI>Recollection,</HI> waiting for the <HI>divine good Pleasure.</HI></P>
<P>Now, tho' the Soul when it is entring on this State be <HI>active,</HI> yet being once in it, it ceases from all <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>distinct Opera∣tions</HI> of its own; not that it is then <HI>idle,</HI> on the contrary, it is in this Juncture <HI>imployed</HI> in the <HI>noblest manner,</HI> for it doth in a <HI>full Bent</HI> and <HI>Tendency,</HI> and with its <HI>Powers</HI> all united, <HI>move</HI> vigorously towards God, but still in a Way of <HI>Tranquility</HI> and <HI>Repose,</HI> and without acting particularly; and the <HI>heaven∣ly Graces</HI> of Faith, Hope, and Love; of Hu∣mility and Resignation, are then in the <HI>sub∣limest Exercise,</HI> tho' not <HI>distinctly</HI> apprehend∣ed by the Soul; whereupon the blessed God, as the Experience of many eminently de∣vout Persons doth abundantly justifie, <HI>visits</HI> these Souls that are thus abandoned to him, and depend on him, with his <HI>peculiar Fa∣vours,</HI> displayes in them <HI>the Riches</HI> of his <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> and makes them feel in an <HI>ineffa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Manner,</HI> the <HI>Reality</HI> of his Pre∣sence in their inward Man; whence it comes to pass, that they improve wonder∣fully in every thing that is <HI>good, just,</HI> and <HI>true, pure,</HI> and <HI>lovely,</HI> and advance with Speed towards <HI>Christian Perfection.</HI></P>

<Q>For Proof of which he quotes <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> and brings in <HI>David</HI> saying to God, <HI>Thou requirest not Sacrifice, else would I have given it thee, but thou delightest not in Burnt-Offer∣ings: The Sacrifice of God is a broken Spirit, a troubled and contrite Heart, O God, dost thou not dispose.</HI> After the Revolt (says he) of <HI>Jerob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am</HI> and the ten Tribes from the

House of <HI>David,</HI> there were many devout and <HI>religious</HI> Persons in <HI>Israel,</HI> and yet we find not that they used the outward Form of Worship which was commanded. <HI>Elias</HI> and <HI>Elizeus,</HI> two great Prophets in <HI>Israel,</HI> did they ever go up to <HI>Hierusalem</HI> to wor∣ship? <HI>Obadiah,</HI> a great Courtier in King <HI>Ahab</HI>'s Court, and one that feared the Lord exceedingly; the seven Thousand which bow∣ed not their Knees to <HI>Baal,</HI> when came they up to the Temple to offer? A Thing which doubtless they would have done, if they had understood the Commandment of God in that behalf to have been absolute indeed. <BIBL>See his Sermon in his <HI>Golden Remains</HI> on these Words, <HI>my Kingdom is not of this World,</HI> p. 203, 204.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Dr. <HI>Gell.</HI> says,
<Q>That St. <HI>Paul</HI> told the <HI>Ga∣latians,</HI> that their ceremonial Observations were weak and <HI>beggarly Elements</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 9.</NOTE>. Such as could not nourish nor strengthen the Soul with Grace. And says he, the same we may say of all Ceremonies, in themselves consider'd; whether they be, first, such as the Church enjoyns, or secondly, such as they observe who oppose them, and oppose the Church in opposing them. In themselves they are no other, whose only Worth is in their Serviceableness, and Signification of
<PB N="106" REF="003985_0115_10036CA553FB7E68"/>
better Things; and therefore he that is ta∣ken with these, in themselves consider'd, feeds as it were on the Husks and Chaff, and neg∣lects the Corn; he admits as it were, the Dish, and tastes not of the Meat: These in themselves are the Meat that perish, vain and empty Things, which shall not profit us in the latter End: <HI>The Heart must be esta∣blished with Grace, and not with such Meat,</HI> Vol. I. Fol. 348.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Observe, then says he, what esteem the Spirit of God hath of a ceremonial Worship, if rested in; all such Services, tho' God's own Institutions, are old Things: And shall we think that Christian Ceremonies if, rested in, are better? — This was St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Practice, and is and ought to be the Duty of every Minister, to warn the People com∣mitted to his Charge touching the Nature of these old Things, that they are such, that they are <HI>transitory,</HI> and that they ought to pass away from such as are new Creatures. <BIBL>Vol. II. Fol. 196.</BIBL></Q></P>
<Q><P>All the Ceremonies in the World cannot adequately signify unto us heavenly Things, but are at the best only Shadows of them, as the Apostle calls them; like the Painters first rude Draught of a Picture with a Coal: And therefore, as the Shadows are the
<PB N="107" REF="003985_0116_10036CA92193C788"/>
longest at the rising and setting of the Sun, so are these ceremonial Shadows.</P>
<P>They were longest in the Rising of the Jewish and Christian Church; if they should grow long again, and we repose Trust in them, it might be feared (which God avert) the Church would set with them.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> 198.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>For be it granted, says he, tho' these cere∣monial old Things preserve the spiritual Truth, as Shells and Skins preserve the <HI>Pulp</HI> and Kernel, yet that's but till the Fruit be ripe, and then these are neglected and cast away. <BIBL>ibid. Fol. 230.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>This reproves those who dote about Types and Figures, and look not for the fulfilling of them in themselves by Christ. <BIBL>Ibid. 265.</BIBL></Q>
<P>And <HI>Burnet</HI> in his second Letter to <HI>Law,</HI> says,
<Q>For even they (the Sacraments) are not strictly Means of Grace, nor does our <HI>Salva∣tion</HI> absolutely depend upon them. <BIBL><HI>pag.</HI> 83.</BIBL></Q></P>
<Q>St. <HI>Peter,</HI> says he, entirely confirms this No¦tion of Baptism, 1 <HI>Epist.</HI> iii. 21. where he expressly lays our Salvation not on the out∣ward Sign, but on the inward Disposition▪ Baptism says he, <HI>doth also now save us (nor the putting away the Filth of the Flesh, but the Answer of a good Conscience towards God) by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</HI> <BIBL>page 85.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><PB N="108" REF="003985_0117_10034FA75506F328"/>It was necessary, says he, that the Apostles should be sent to preach the Gospel to all Nations, baptizing them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But, that therefore it is still absolutely necessary to be baptized by one of a particular Set, or Suc∣cession of Men, does not in the least follow; especially considering that no Mention of this Necessity, or even Intention, is ever once made throughout all the Writings either of the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> or of any of the Apostles. <BIBL><HI>p.</HI> 166, 167.</BIBL></Q>
<P>And speaking of the Supper, he says,
<Q>The Effect of this Prayer (meaning what is cal∣led the Prayer of Consecration, <HI>p.</HI> 42.) is not CONVERTING <HI>the Bread and Wine into Means of Grace, by a humane Benediction.</HI> CONVERTING is a Term, says he, I can never hear, without fearing, that by degrees the old Doctrine of Transubstantia∣tion is to be stolen in upon us again; yet you says he to <HI>Law,</HI> seem to be particularly fond of it. But there is no such CONVERSION wrought by the Prayer of <HI>Consecration,</HI> nor are there any Means of Grace there says he, but the Disposition of the Hearts <BIBL><HI>p.</HI> 43.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>To which he adds afterwards,
<Q>Here is no immediate Necessity of any Minister: And so we do not find expressed any Intention that there should be any: Our Saviour gives no Commission to any to be such, as he did

in <HI>Baptism</HI>; nor do the Apostles any where intimate that there ever was any such <HI>Mi∣nister</HI> of this Sacrament in their Time, or leave any Directions about chusing or ap∣pointing one to their Followers, or appointing any themselves for this Purpose. <BIBL><HI>p.</HI> 167, 168.</BIBL></Q></P>
<Q>And, says he, far be it from me, or from any Christian, to take upon us, to judge or condemn those, who after such a Measure of Industry in finding Truth, as humane Pru∣dence and ordinary Discretion, as Mr. <HI>Chilling∣worth</HI> states it, advises them to; do not and cannot satisfy themselves, that Christ has re∣quired the Continuance of those outward Ac∣tions which he never laid any Stress upon, but as Signs of inward good Dispositions; — I dare the less do this, says he, when I observe what <HI>plain Difference</HI> our Saviour himself has placed between the Thing and the Sign of it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mar. xvi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. — And farther, when I consider how small a Weight is laid on these TWO CEREMONIES of his own In∣stitution, says he, in the Gospel, in compa∣rison of the great Weight which is there laid on Matters of quite another <HI>Nature</HI>; how often the one is spoken of, and insisted upon, and how seldom the other.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XI.</HI> Of the <HI>Possibility</HI> and <HI>Necessity</HI> of keeping the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>God</HI> in <HI>this Life</HI> by the <HI>Assistance</HI> of the <HI>Grace of God.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TO believe that God hath given us a Law to keep, which is either in its own Na∣ture, or through Means of our Corruption, impossible by supernatural Aid to be kept; is to believe very preposterously of God, and to cast a very high and dishonourable Reflection on his Justice and Goodness.</P>
<P>To think that he hath given an impossible Law to Mankind, is to think he hath given them no Law at all, because such a Law can be no Law to rational Creatures. An impossible Law is a Solecism, a Law that is impossible to be kept, is no Law in it self, but must be void from the Beginning; as being intirely con∣trary to the Reason and Nature of Things.</P>
<P>To think that the Grace which is come unto us by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> is not sufficient to purifie, and rectifie our Natures, and enable us to keep his Laws, since 'twas for our <HI>Breach</HI> thereof
<PB N="116" REF="003985_0125_10036CC2ECF4D5B8"/>
that he dyed, and made Atonement on the only and absolute Condition of our Repentance and Leading a new Life; is to think very unbecom∣ingly of his great Undertaking, for us, and to render him no Saviour at all. For if he be not a Saviour from Sin, which is, and ever was the Cause of God's Wrath towards Men; his Displeasure with them must needs remain; since he is of more pure Eyes than to behold Ini∣quity. The Holiness of his Nature will not admit any unholy Creature to abide with him; And therefore as <HI>Adam</HI> when he broke the Law of God, and defiled his Heart, was driven from his holy Presence; so the Heart must be clean∣sed and we must return to Obedience to God's Law, before we can approach him, and enjoy his Delightful Presence again.</P>
<P>For this End therefore, <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, not from the Guilt of it only, but from the Act, from the Thing it self, and pu∣rify to himself a peculiar People, zealous of good Works <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 14.</NOTE>. He came to finish the Trans∣gression, to make an End of Sins, and to make Reconciliation for Iniquity, and to bring in everlasting Righteousness <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dan. ix. 24.</NOTE>. In a Word he came to save his People from their Sins. (not in their Sins) <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mat. i 21.</NOTE>. And the beloved Disciple seems very
<PB N="117" REF="003985_0126_10036CC47415ADE0"/>
sensible of this important Truth; for, says he, <HI>He that committeth Sin is of the Devil for the Devil sinneth from the Beginning. For this Pur∣pose</HI> (therefore adds he) <HI>the Son of God was made manifest that he might destroy the Works of the Devil</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. iii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>'Tis the first and capital Article in the Creed of the Kingdom of Darkness to believe the Power of Satan in us to be stronger in it self than the Power of Christ in us; a more direct Doctrine to perpetual Bondage unto Sin and Satan in this Life, cannot be invented; nor more opposite to the Kingdom of God and its coming in the Hearts of Men. This is believing the Devil is almighty in us instead of God, and that <HI>Christ</HI> in us is not able to de∣throne him, and cast him out of the Hearts of Men. A Doctrine contrary to that of our Saviour, who represents himself and that very truly, to be stronger than the strong Man, who hath long kept the House; as one that is abe to cast him out and spoil his Goods <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Mat. xii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE>.</P>
<P>And to that of the beloved Disciple, who told the Christians, greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the World <NOTE N="§†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ii <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> John. iv. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To call upon Men, to fight manfully against Sin and Satan; and yet at the same Time to tell them they cannot conquer, by any <HI>Aid</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="003985_0127_10036CC6011E9B18"/>
they can have in this Life, but shall infallibly be conquered; is as great a Discouragement to Christians in the Pursuit of Virtue, as it would be to military Men, to treat them after such a Manner, in their Calling; contrary to the Wisdom and Prudence of all Commanders.</P>
<P>Tis rendring Prayer to God for Help and Strength against inward Corruptions and vitious Habits, vain and to no Purpose; and in a Word strikes at the very Vitals and Essence of Reli∣gion; at the Kingdom and Dominion of <HI>Christ</HI> in the Hearts of Men: And is indeed a Doctrine contrary to Godliness and all Goodness, which one would think could never have entered into the Hearts of any Men, but such as would make a Penny of the Peoples Sins, and are themselves immerged in Impurity and Darkness; such as are Strangers to the Life of God in their Souls; such as are Ignorant of the Power of divine Grace, and unsensible of the efficacious Operation of the divine Spirit in their own Hearts; through Neglect of Attenti∣on to it, and Dependance upon it; and in a Word such as have their Heads filled with meer empty Notions of God, without their Hearts being turned to him.</P>
<P>For nothing can be more evident and plain, to a Soul entred into the paths of Virtue, than that God who hath begun this good Work in them, is able to carry it on effectually, and
<PB N="119" REF="003985_0128_10036CCF11BF9FF8"/>
compleat it; than that Christ who hath begun the Work of Holiness in their Souls, is able to perfect it; to thoroughly purge his Floor <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vii. 1.</NOTE>; to save them to the uttermost who come unto God by him <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mat. iii. 12.</NOTE>; to deliver them (intirey) from the Bondage of Corruption, and bring them into the glorious Liberty of the Children of God <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. vii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So that all the Failures, Miscarriages and Evils which Men fall into, who in the Main may seek after Virtue and eternal Life, must be ascribed to their Want of Watchfulness; to their Want of dwelling with God; to their Want of Due Subjection to the divine Spirit in their own Hearts; and not to a Necessity they are under of <HI>sinning</HI>; not to Want of Power in the divine Grace, to save them from it; but for Want of their steddy and constant Adherence, to that heavenly Help; For want of Application to God, to be strengthned with Might by his Spirit in the inner Man <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 2.</NOTE>. Man must place his Sins to his own Account, and his Salvation from them to God's Account: That God in all Things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be Praise and Dominion for ever and ever <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iv. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Would Men accustom themselves to a daily and constant Turning of their Thoughts, and Minds from the external Creation; from rest∣ing

<P>In above 200 several Places of which Col∣lection I find the said Doctrine taught, and shall accordingly present the Reader with a few Instances thereof.</P>
<Q>O! What a World of People (says Dr. <HI>Gell</HI>) are tempted by the Devil?

<Q>He who commands thee this Duty (says he) <HI>is the Way, the Truth and the Life, the Wisdom,</HI> the <HI>one Lawgiver,</HI> who knows what we are able to do, and therefore would not give us an <HI>impossible Law.</HI> He is the <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> he is ready to impower thee to all whatever he commands, only he requires that thou comply with him. <BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> 148.</BIBL></Q>

<Q>They believe, says he, that the Devil can make a <HI>perfect</HI> wicked Man, but they believe not that <HI>it's possible,</HI> the Lord, whom they confess Omnipotent and Almighty, that he can make a Man <HI>perfect.</HI> Do they not ascribe more Power to the <HI>Devil</HI> than to <HI>God</HI> himself. <BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> 239.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>Our Lord, says he, the VVisdom of God, and Righteousness of God, would not give a Law that is <HI>impossible,</HI> nor blame Men for omitting and not fulfilling that which is <HI>im∣possible</HI> and not <HI>feasible</HI> to them. <BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> 415.</BIBL></Q>

all Sins yea all Things, <HI>&amp;c</HI>; this is no <HI>erroneous</HI> Doctrine, but the very same which was preached by the <HI>Evangelists</HI> and <HI>Apo∣stles:</HI> That <HI>Jesus</HI> should be so called because <HI>he should save his People from their Sins</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt. i. 21.</NOTE>. <HI>That Jesus is the Lamb of God that taketh away the Sins of the World</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Joh. i.</NOTE>. That <HI>God hath sent Jesus to bless us, and to turn every one of us from our Iniquities</HI> That this is the very same Doctrine which the Apostle preached in this Text (<HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 38, 39.) when he saith, <HI>That by this Man is preached unto us Remission of Sins.</HI> VVherefore to teach Men that Re∣mission and Putting away of Sins, and Ju∣stification, and Cleansing from all Sins, is <HI>impossible</HI> in this Life, through Christ, and not to be <HI>believed,</HI> is to teach Men <HI>Unbe∣lief</HI>; yea it is to teach despising of the great Grace of God, to teach false accusing of God, and his VVays; yea it is to teach A∣postacy, and Revolt from God and his VVays. Hence we may learn how to judge of the present Generation, who think it a Thing al∣together <HI>impossible,</HI> that <HI>Sin</HI> should be <HI>wholly</HI> put away, removed and turned from us; tho' it be <HI>promised</HI> to be done by <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> <BIBL>Ibid. 703.</BIBL></Q>

There is no Popish Purgatory to cleanse us, and purge us from the Reliques of Uncleanness (which Men say must be in us, while we live in this World) — I need not prove this to you; therefore if ever we enter into the Holy City, we must really, and not by imagi∣nation, and throughly be purged and clean∣sed from Sin in this Life; since we know this, <HI>Let us cleanse our selves from all Pollution both of Flesh and Spirit</HI> <BIBL>Vol. II. Fol. 80.</BIBL></Q></P>
<Q>Beloved, says he, to believe that God accepts Christ's Sufferings for us, so that we need not suffer with him, and die with him to all our Sins, is to believe a Lie. <BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> 240.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>VVhat else do they mean, says he, who say that it's impossible, but that of Necessity we must sin? Is not this to deny the <HI>Resur∣rection</HI> from the <HI>Death of Sin</HI> to the <HI>Life of Righteousness.</HI> <BIBL>Ibid. 349.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> says he, is a <HI>perfect</HI> Saviour, he saves us from every evil VVork, both that which otherwise we might suffer, and that which otherwise we might do. First, That which otherwise we might suffer: This is the more to be noted, because when
<PB N="128" REF="003985_0137_10036CE620365680"/>
we speak of Christ as a Saviour, we do not commonly apprehend him according to the Largeness and Amplitude of Salvation, but confine his Salvation unto <HI>this,</HI> or <HI>that:</HI> as when we say he is our Saviour, and saves us from our Sins, — according to the <HI>Angel</HI>'s Etymology of his Name. But when we enquire from what he saves, tho' the <HI>Angel,</HI> says from <HI>Sins,</HI> we commonly say, he saves us from that we most fear, <HI>i. e. Punishment for Sin:</HI> But Punishment for Sin, is not Sin; if he <HI>saves us from Sin,</HI> he saves from that which is the <HI>Cause of Pun∣ishment.</HI> He is able to save us to <HI>the utter∣most.</HI> <BIBL>Ibid. 406.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>If the Lord, says he, deliver from every evil Work, then may the People of the Lord, his Believers, be saved and delivered from every Sin. This is a strong Conse∣quence: <HI>A potentia ad actum non valet con∣sequentia:</HI> As because Christ is able <HI>to save to the utmost</HI>; therefore he will so do: This thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be most true, as appears by ma∣ny Scriptures, yet the Consequence is not true: But when the <HI>Apostle</HI> saith, that the Lord will <HI>deliver from every evil Work,</HI> it undoubtedly follows that Believers <HI>may be saved,</HI> and delivered from all and every evil Work, and Sin; <HI>ab actu ad potentiam valet consequentia, from the Act which is pramised,
<PB N="129" REF="003985_0138_10034FBBF6D21690"/>
to the Power this follows undeniably.</HI> <BIBL>Ibid. 407.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>Hence it is evident, says he, that they who believe not, that the Lord is able to subdue all their Spiritual Enemies, and bring them into the Heavenly <HI>Canaan,</HI> they are truly said to tempt the Lord by their Unbelief in the Power of God. <BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> 667.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>And, says he, <HI>The Law of the Lord is per∣fect, converting the Soul</HI>; that is, the Law of the Lord is perfect in it self, and mak∣eth others perfect, which by the Assistance of the Holy Spirit fashion and conform their Lives thereto. <BIBL>749.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>But, says he, we desire not that God should <HI>cleanse us from all our Unrighteous∣ness,</HI> though that be added <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. i. 9.</NOTE>. We love that too well to part with it, and say it is <HI>impossible</HI> to be cleansed from it — and yet, says he, we have so much Religion (such as it is) that it hath devoured all Honesty, Truth, Justice, Faithfulness; we have so much of the imagined Righteous∣ness of Christ, that it pays our Debts for us, it feeds the Hungry for us, it cloaths the Naked for us, it relieves the Oppressed, visits the Sick. In a Word, we are so righ∣teous by the imagined Righteousness of Christ, that we can neither live sober, nor
<PB N="130" REF="003985_0139_10036CEA2B417C80"/>
chaste, nor just, nor honest, nor merciful, nor true, nor faithful; yet righteous all this while, by the imputed Righteousness of Christ. We have so tenter'd the Righteous∣ness of Christ, that it serves to hide all our Unrighteousness, our Drunkenness, our Whoredom, our Lying, our Cheating, our Couzening, our Oppressing, our Unmerciful∣ness; in a word, it is, <HI>A Mantle of Religion to cover our Knavery.</HI> Ibid. 799.</Q>
<Q>Is there not, saith he, a Promise of greater Grace, <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. v.</NOTE>, a Supply of more Help by the <HI>Second Adam,</HI> than lost by the <HI>First?</HI> <BIBL>Ibid. 803.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>The Word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Salvation,</HI> says he, is considerable; either 1. In regard of the Term <HI>a quo,</HI> from Sin: Thus it is a Delive∣rance from the Power of Sin, and Pol∣lution of it, and Punishment for it: Or, 2. In respect of the Term <HI>ad quem,</HI> the bringing of Everlasting Righteousness, Life and Glory. We have both these together 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 18. <HI>The Lord shall deliver me from every evil Work, and shall preserve me unto his everlasting Kingdom.</HI> <BIBL>Ibid 807.</BIBL></Q>
<P>'Tis true indeed, says he, Degrees there
<Q>are of those that are born of God <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Joh. ii. 12, 13.</NOTE>; yet
<PB N="131" REF="003985_0140_10036CECFAED9628"/>
is there no Degree so low, but hath with it an Ability of resisting, and not yielding to and obeying the World? <BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI> 819.</BIBL></Q></P>
<Q>But how is it possible for me, says he, to overcome the World? This Conceit is of <HI>Impossibility,</HI> O how does it blunt all En∣deavours, and weakens Faith. See <HI>Notes</HI> on <HI>Col.</HI> iii. 1. <HI>They could not enter in because of Unbelief.</HI> <BIBL>Ibid 827.</BIBL></Q>
<Q>And, says he, how likely a Thing it is, that this Age should afford many Friends of God and Christ, it appears by our Opi∣nion we have almost generally entertained throughout the whole Christian, World, and more notably among us; <HI>That it is impos∣sible to be a Friend of Christ.</HI> Is there any such Opinion?

<Q>Whatever Heights I may have raised it (the necessary Duty of Religion says he) up unto, they are such as are <HI>warrantable</HI> because evidently founded on the Doctrine of the Gospel, which without doubt doth not oblige us to any Thing that is <HI>imprac∣ticable</HI> or <HI>impossible.</HI> <BIBL>Ibid. 456.</BIBL></Q>
<Q><PB N="134" REF="003985_0143_10036CF4F16D6588"/><P>Since, says he, our blessed Lord in de∣livering the Christian Doctrine to the World, intended that the excellent Precepts of it should be obeyed, it evidently fol∣lows, that <HI>Obedience to them is not impossible or impracticable.</HI> It were to be sure very absurd, yea, even blasphemous, to assert, that our merciful Redeemer, who sufficient∣ly understood the Infirmities and Weakness of Mankind, and who came to deliver them from the uneasie Yoke of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Cere∣monies on the one Hand, and from the sa∣vage and inhuman Rites of <HI>Gentilism</HI> on the other, should himself bind unsupporta∣ble Burthens on his Followers, and prescribe them Tasks that they were not able to per∣form.</P>

'Tis not the submitting our selves to the Decrees, Determinations, and Dictates of fallible Men; to the Rites, Ceremonies, and Injunctions of Men, in Relation to Externals, but a depending on, and Complyance with the internal Light, Operations and Injunctions of the divine Spirit in the Soul; having the Powers and Capacities of the Soul dilated and laid open to the Influence of Heaven, by an upright Application to God, and waiting on him, with a Mind sequestered from this World, and vi∣sible Objects; with a Mind and Heart, <HI>see king the Kingdom of God and his Righteousness</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">—vi 33.</NOTE>, <HI>fol∣lowing Christ in the Regeneration</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">—xix. 28.</NOTE>, <HI>and doing whatsoever he commandeth</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Joh. xv. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As every Man must <HI>give Account of himself to God</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 11</NOTE>, so let every one of us address our

selves to Him, his Son and Spirit, and here what he speaks in us, by his blessed Spirit, and what he speaks to us by his sacred Writ∣ings the BIBLE; let us frequently read <HI>these</HI> holy Writings; and as frequently turn our Minds to this holy Spirit; <HI>for as holy Men of God, of old,</HI> (wrote or) <HI>spake them as they were moved by the holy Spirit</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pet. i 21.</NOTE>, so Men of God now can have no <HI>adequate</HI> Knowledge of them, no Knowledge of them which is divine and saving by any other Medium, but only the same Spirit by which they were wrote; for as they are <HI>Things of God so no Man knows them but by the Spirit of God</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cor. ii. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Laying aside therefore the Power and Preju∣dice we may have received by Education and Tradition, the vicious Inclinations and Habits of <HI>Malice, Guile, Hypocrisie, Envy,</HI> and <HI>Evil Speaking,</HI> let us <HI>as new born Babes desire the sin∣cere Milk of God's Words</HI> (in Respect of what he Dictates, both without us, and within us,) <HI>that we may grow thereby</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 2.</NOTE>, that we may be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed</HI> and <HI>nourished</HI> by him unto <HI>eternal Life</HI>; for as our Souls are <HI>Spirits,</HI> and want <HI>spiritual</HI> Sustenance; so God alone is that <HI>Spirit</HI> which can yield it to us, and bestow upon us the heavenly <HI>Viands</HI>; who can give unto us <HI>the

true Bread from Heaven</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joh. vi. 32.</NOTE>; and let us not con∣tent our selves with any <HI>Shadows</HI> and <HI>Figures</HI> of it; or any external or bodily Service; f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 'tis the Labour of the Mind, the Hunger a Thirst of the Soul, as influenced by the divine Spirit, that is the necessary Work, and pro∣per Qualifications for partaking <HI>of the Meat which endureth unto everlasting Life</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Joh. vi. 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As Mankind come into <HI>this Exercise of</HI> Mind so acceptable to God, and profitable to them∣selves, from a true Sense of their spiritual Wants, their Crys and Prayers, in and under the Aid and Power of his Spirit, will enter into the Ears of the Almighty, and have Ac∣cess to him, and meet with suitable Returns of Comfort and Supplies from him. Here Ministers will have the heavenly Bread to break to the People; they will not feed them with husky Notions, with dry and jejune Discourses, with humane Compositions, and <HI>Words which Man's Wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth</HI> <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As their Ministry will spring from God, so it will lead to God; 'twill not be a dead, but <HI>living Ministry</HI> 'twill reach to the Heart and tend to raise it into a living Sense of God;
<PB N="140" REF="003985_0149_10036D04F510AFB0"/>
'twill not impede and hinder the Souls of them who are breathing for a greater Sensation of the <HI>Life of God</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 18.</NOTE> in themselves, but will be a <HI>Furtherance</HI> and <HI>Help</HI> to them in that divine Exercise; and Ministers and Hearers <HI>will be made to drink into one Spirit</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xii. 13.</NOTE>. <HI>They will all eat the same Spiritual Meat, and all drink the same spiritual Drink</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">— x. 3, 4.</NOTE>; <HI>and being fitly framed toge∣ther, will grow into an Holy Temple of the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="§*" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii.</NOTE>: In which Temple the Lord will dwell, and <HI>delight</HI> to do <HI>Good,</HI> to these Souls who are thus fitly framed together in Him.</P>
<P>Such Souls will know beyond all Hesitation the Certainty and Reality of the Existence of the Deity. They will not only be convinced of that great Truth, from clear Deductions of Reason and Scripture, but will feel and wit∣ness it, by such sensible, transporting, and de∣lightful <HI>Manifestations</HI> of God in their own Hearts, as will make them no more to doubt of his Existence, as <HI>Monro</HI> says, than they can doubt that the Sun shines, when at Mid∣day, with open Eyes they see his Light and feel his warming Influences.</P>
