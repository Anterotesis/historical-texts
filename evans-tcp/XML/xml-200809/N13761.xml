<HEAD>NEW-HAMPSHIRE. In <HI>CONGRESS,</HI> at <HI>EXETER,</HI> Jan. <HI>5, 1776.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE, the members of the congress of the colony of New-Hampshire, chosen and appointed by the free suffrages of the people of said colony, and authorised and impowered by them, to meet together, and use such means, and pursue such measures, as we shall judge best for the public good; and in particular to establish some form of government, provided that mea∣sure should be recommended by the Continental Congress; and a recommendation to that purpose having been trans∣mitted to us, from the said Congress; have taken into our serious consideration the unhappy circumstances into which this colony is involved, by means of many griev∣ous and oppressive acts of the British Parliament, de∣priving
<PB N="4" REF="017390_0004_0FA111B7881B7C38" MS="y"/>
us of our native and constitutional rights and pri∣vileges; to enforce obedience to which acts, a powerful fleet and army have been sent into this country, by the ministry of Great-Britain, who have exercised a wanton and cruel abuse of their power, in destroying the lives and properties of the colonists, in many places, with fire and sword, taking the ships and lading from many of the ho∣nest and industrious inhabitants of this colony, employed in commerce, agreeable to the laws and customs a long time used here:</P>
<P>The sudden and abrupt departure of his excellency John Wentworth, esq. our late governor, and several of the council, leaving us destitute of legislation; and no executive courts being open to punish criminal offenders, whereby the lives and properties of the honest people of this colony, are liable to the machinations and evil de∣signs of wicked men:</P>
<P>Therefore, for the preservation of peace and good order, and for the security of the lives and properties of the in∣habitants of this colony, we conceive ourselves reduced to the necessity of establishing a Form of Government, to continue during the present unhappy and unnatural con∣test with Great-Britain; protesting and declaring, that we never sought to throw off our dependance upon Great-Britain, but felt ourselves happy under her protection, while we could enjoy our constitutional rights and privi∣leges—and that we shall rejoice, if such a reconciliation between us and our parent state can be effected, as shall be approved by the Continental Congress, in whose pru∣dence and wisdom we confide.</P>
<P>Accordingly, pursuant to the trust: reposed in us, we do Resolve, that this congress assume the name, power, and authority of a Home of Representatives or Assembly, for the colony of New-Hampshire: and that said house, then proceed to choose twelve persons, being reputable free∣holders, and inhabitants within this colony, in the follow∣ing manner, <HI>viz.</HI> five in the county of Rockingham, two in the county of Strafford, two in the county of Hillsborough, two in the county of Cheshire, and one in the county of
<PB N="5" REF="017390_0005_0FA111B84DB8DCF8" MS="y"/>
Grafton, to be a distinct and separate branch of the le∣gislature, by the name of a council for this colony, to continue as such until the third Wednesday in December next; any seven of whom to be a quorum, to do busi∣ness.</P>
<P>That such council appoint their President; and in his absence, that the senior counsellor preside.</P>
<P>That a Secretary be appointed by both branches, who may be a counsellor, or otherwise, as they shall choose.</P>
<P>That no act, or resolve be valid, and put into exe∣cution, unless agreed to and passed by both branches of the legislature.</P>
<P>That all public officers for the said colony, and each county, for the current year, be appointed by the coun∣cil and assembly, except the several clerks of the exe∣cutive courts, who shall be appointed by the Justices of the respective courts.</P>
<P>That all bills, resolves, or votes for raising, levying and collecting money, originate in the house of represen∣tatives.</P>
<P>That at any sessions of the council and assembly, nei∣ther branch shall adjourn for any longer time than from Saturday till the next Monday, without consent of the other.</P>
<P>And it is further Resolved, That if the pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt unhap∣py dispute with Great-Britain, should continue longer than the present year, and the Continental Congress give no instructions or directions to the contrary, the council be chosen by the people of each respective county, in such manner as the council and house of representatives shall order.</P>
<P>That general and field officers of the militia, on any vacancy, be appointed by the two houses, and all inferior officers be chosen by the respective companies.</P>
<P>That all officers of the army be appointed by the two houses, except they should direct otherwise in case of any emergency.</P>
<P>That all civil officers for the colony, and for each county be appointed, and the time of their continuance in

<P>That a treasurer, and a recorder of deeds, for each county be annually chosen, by the people of each county respectively; the votes for such officers to be returned to the respective courts of general sessions of the peace, in the county, there to be ascertained, as the council and assembly shall hereafter direct.</P>
<P>That precepts, in the name of the council and as∣sembly, signed by the president of the council, and speak∣er of the house of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epresentatives, shall issue annually, at or before the first day of November for the choice of a council, and house of representatives, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be returned by the third Wednesday in December then next ensuing, in such manner as the council and assembly shall here∣after prescribe.</P>

<HEAD>MASSACHUSETTS. A <HI>CONSTITUTION,</HI> or <HI>FRAME</HI> of <HI>GOVERN∣MENT,</HI> agreed upon by the <HI>Delegates</HI> of the People of the State of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> in <HI>CONVENTION,</HI> begun and held at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> on the First of September, <HI>1779,</HI> and continued by Adjournments, to the Second of March, <HI>1780.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="preamble">
<HEAD>PREAMBLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE end of the institution, maintenance and admi∣nistration of government, is to secure the existence of the body-politic, to protect it, and to furnish the in∣dividuals who compose it, with the power of enjoying, in safety and tranquillity, their natural right, and the bles∣sings of life: And whenever these great objects are not obtained, the people have a right to alter the govern∣ment, and to take measures necessary for their safety, prosperity and happiness.</P>
<P>The body-politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals: It is a social compact, by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governed by certain laws for the common good. It is the duty of the people, therefore, in framing a constitution of government, to provide for an equitable mode of making laws, as well as for an impartial interpretation, and a faithful execution of them; that every man may, at all times, find his security in them.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017390_0008_0FA111BE4E20CE58"/>We, therefore, the people of Massachusetts, acknow∣ledging, with grateful hearts, the goodness of the Great Legislator of the Universe, in affording us, in the course of his providence, an opportunity, deliberately, and peace∣ably, without fraud, violence, or surprize, of entering into an original, explicit, and solemn compact with each other; and of forming a new constitution of civil government, for ourselves and posterity; and devoutly imploring his direction in so interesting a design, DO agree upon, or∣dain, and establish, the following <HI>Declaration of Rights,</HI> and <HI>Frame of Government,</HI> as the CONSTITUTION <HI>of the</HI> COMMONWEALTH <HI>of</HI> MASSACHUSETTS.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>PART I.</HI> A DECLARATION of RIGHTS, of the Inhabitants of the Commonwealth of <HI>Massachusetts.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> I. ALL men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, essential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoy∣ing and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquir∣ing, possessing, and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness.</P>
<P N="2">II. It is the right as well as the duty of all men in so∣ciety, publicly, and at stated seasons, to worship the Su∣preme Being, thd great Creator and Preserver of the Uni∣verse. And no subject shall be hurt, molested, or restrain∣ed in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshipping God in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience; or for his religious profession or sen∣timents; provided he doth not disturb the public peace, or obstruct others in their religious worship.</P>
<P N="3">III. As the happiness of a people, and the good order and preservation of civil government, essentially depend upon piety, religion, and morality; and as these cannot be generally diffused through a community, but by the institution of the public worship of God, and of public
<PB N="9" REF="017390_0009_0FA111C064E52120"/>
instructions in piety, religion and morality: Therefore, to promote their happiness, and to secure the good order and preservation of their government, the people of this com∣monwealth have a right to invest their legislature with power to authorise and require, and the legislature shall, from time to time, authorise and require the several towns, parishes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious societies, to make suitable provision, at their own expence, for the institution of the public worship of God, and for the support and maintenance of public protestant teachers of piety, religion, and morality, in all cases where such provision shall not be made voluntarily.</P>
<P>And the people of this commonwealth, have also a right to, and do, invest their legislature with authority to enjoin, upon all the subjects, an attendance upon the in∣structions of the public teachers as aforesaid, at stated times and seasons, if there be any on whose instructions they can conscientiously and conveniently attend.</P>
<P>Provided notwithstanding, that the several towns, pa∣rishes, precincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious so∣cieties, shall, at all times, have the exclusive right of elec∣ting their public teachers, and of contracting with them for their support and maintenance.</P>
<P>And all monies paid by the subject to the support of public worship, and of the public teachers aforesaid, shall, if he require it, be uniformly applied to the support of the public teacher or teachers of his own religious sect or de∣nomination, provided there be any on whose instructions he attends; otherwise it may be paid towards the support of the teacher or teachers of the parish or precinct in which the said monies are raised.</P>
<P>And every denomination of Christians demeaning them∣selves peaceably, and as good subjects of the common∣wealth, shall be equally under the protection of the law: And no subordination of any one sect or denomination to another, shall ever be established by law.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The people of this commonwealth have the sole and exclusive right of governing themselves as a free, so∣vereign, and independent state; and do, and forever here∣after
<PB N="10" REF="017390_0010_0FA111C0AD99BC90" MS="y"/>
shall, exercise and enjoy every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not, or may not hereafter, be by them expresly delegat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the United States of America, in Congress assembled.</P>
<P N="5">V. All power residing originally in the people, and be∣ing derived from them, the several magistrates and offi∣cers of government, vested with authority, whether legis∣lative, executive, or judicial, are their substitutes and agents, and are at all times accountable to them.</P>
<P N="6">VI. No man, or corporation, or association of men, have any other title to obtain advantages, or particular and exclusive privileges, distinct from those of the com∣munity, than what arises from the consideration of services rendered to the public; and this title being in nature nei∣ther hereditary nor transmissible to children, or descend∣ents, or relations by blood, the idea of a man born a ma∣gistrate, lawgiver, or judge, is absurd and unnatural.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Government is instituted for the common good; for the protection, safety, prosperity, and happiness of the people; and not for the profit, honour, or private inte∣rest of any one man, family, or class of men: Therefore, the people alone have an incontestible, unalienable, and indefeasible right, to institute government; and to reform, alter, or totally change the same, when their protection, safety, prosperity, and happiness require it.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. In order to prevent those, who are vested with authority from becoming oppressors, the people have a right, at such periods, and in such manner as they shall establish by their frame of government, to cause their pub∣lic officers to return to private life; and to fill up vacant places, by certain and regular elections and appointments.</P>
<P N="9">IX. All elections ought to be free, and all the inhabi∣tants of this commonwealth, having such qualifications as they shall establish by their frame of government, have an equal right to elect officers, and to be elected for public employments.</P>
<P N="10">X. Each individual of the society has a right to be pro∣tected by it, in the enjoyment of his life, liberty, and property, according to standing laws. He is obliged,
<PB N="11" REF="017390_0011_0FA111C1E047B7B8"/>
consequently, to contribute his share to the expence of this protection; to give his personal service, or an equiva∣lent, when necessary: But no part of the property of any individual, can, with justice, be taken from him, or ap∣plied to public uses, without his own consent, or that of the representative body of the people: In fine, the peo∣ple of this commonwealth are not controulable by any other laws, than those to which their constitutional repre∣sentative body have given their consent. And whenever the public exigences require, that the property of any in∣dividual should be appropriated to public uses, he shall receive a reasonable compensation therefor.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Every subject of the commonwealth ought to find a certain remedy, by having recourse to the laws for all in∣juries or wrongs which he may receive in his person, property or character. He ought to obtain right and justice freely, and without being obliged to purchase it; compleatly, and without any denial; promptly, and with∣out delay; conformably to the laws.</P>
<P N="12">XII. No subject shall be held to answer for any crime or offence, until the same is fully and plainly, substanti∣ally and formally, described to him; or be compelled to accuse, or furnish evidence against himself. And every subject shall have a right to produce all proofs that may be favourable to him; to meet the witnesses against him face to face, and to be fully heard in his defence by him∣self, or his council, at his election. And no subject shall be arrested, imprisoned, despoiled, or deprived of his property, immunities, or privileges, put out of the pro∣tection of the law, exiled, or deprived of his life, liberty, or estate, but by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.</P>
<P>And the legislature shall not make any law, that shall subject any person to a capital or infamous punishment, excepting for the government of the army and navy, with∣out trial by jury.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. In criminal prosecutions, the verification of facts in the vicinity where they happen, is one of the greatest securities of the life, liberty, and property of the citizen.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="12" REF="017390_0012_0FA111C20A6C0F70"/>XIV. Every subject has a right to be secure from all unrea∣sonable searches, and seizures, of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or affirmation; and if the order in a warrant to a civil officer, to make search in all suspected places, or to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to seize their property, be not ac∣companied with a special designation of the persons or ob∣jects of search, arrest, or seizure; and no warrant ought to be issued, but in cases and with the formalities pre∣scribed by the laws.</P>
<P N="15">XV. In all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between two or more persons, except in cases in which it has heretofore been otherways used and prac∣tised, the parties have a right to a trial by a jury; and this method of procedure shall be held sacred, unless, in causes arising on the high seas, and such as relate to mariners wages, the legislature shall hereafter find it necessary to alter it.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The liberty of the press is essential to the securi∣ty of freedom in a state; it ought not, therefore, to be restrained in this commonwealth.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. The people have a right to keep and to bear arms for the common defence. And as in time of peace armies are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature, and the military power shall always be held in exact subordina∣tion to the civil authority, and be governed by it.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. A frequent recurrence to the fundamental prin∣ciples of the constitution, and a constant adherence to those of piety, justice, moderation, temperance, industry, and frugality, are absolutely necessary, to preserve the ad∣vantages of liberty, and to maintain a free government. The people ought, consequently, to have a particular at∣tention to all those principles, in the choice of their offi∣cers and representatives: And they have a right to require of their lawgivers and magistrates, an exact and constant observance of them, in the formation and execution of all
<PB N="13" REF="017390_0013_0FA111C2CB0F7778"/>
laws necessary for the good administration of the common∣wealth.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. The people have a right, in an orderly and peaceable manner, to assemble to consult upon the com∣mon good; give instructions to their representatives; and to request of the legislative body, by the way of addresses, petitions, or remonstrances, redress of the wrongs done them, and of the grievances they suffer.</P>
<P N="20">XX. The power of suspending the laws, or the exe∣cution of the laws, ought never to be exercised but by the legislature, or by authority derived from it, to be exercised in such particular cases only as the legislature shall expres∣ly provide for.</P>
<P N="21">XXI. The freedom of deliberation, speech, and de∣bate, in either house of the legislature, is so essential to the rights of the people, that it cannot be the foundation of any accusation or prosecution, action, or complaint, in any other court or place whatsoever.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. The legislature ought frequently to assemble for the redress of grievances, for correcting, strengthening, and confirming the laws, and for making new laws, as the common good may require.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. No subsidy, charge, tax, impost, or duties, ought to be established, fixed, laid, or levied, under any pretext whatsoever, without the consent of the people, or their representatives in the legislature.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. Laws made to punish for actions done before the existence of such laws, and which have not been de∣clared crimes by preceding laws, are unjust, oppressive, and inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a free government.</P>
<P N="15">XXV. No subject ought, in any case, or in any time, to be declared guilty of treason or felony by the legisla∣ture.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. No magistrate or court of law shall demand excessive bail or sureties, impose excessive fines, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. In time of peace, no soldier ought to be quar∣tered in any house without the consent of the owner; and
<PB N="14" REF="017390_0014_0FA111C3898DDCA0"/>
in time of war, such quarters ought not to be made, but by the civil magistrate, in a manner ordained by the legislature.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. No person can in any case be subjected to law-martial, or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, except those employed in the army or navy, and except the militia in actual service, but by authority of the legis∣lature.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. It is essential to the preservation of the rights of every individual, his life, liberty, property, and character, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws, and ad∣ministration of justice. It is the right of every citizen to be tried by judges as free, impartial, and independent, as the lot of humanity will admit. It is, therefore, not only the best policy, but for the security of the rights of the people, and of every citizen, that the judges of the supreme judicial court should hold their offices as long as they behave themselves well; and that they should have honourable sa∣laries, ascertained and established by standing laws.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. In the government of this Commonwealth, the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or either of them: The executive shall ne∣ver exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them: The judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them: to the end, it may be a government of laws, and not of men.</P>

<P>THE people inhabiting the territory formerly called the Province of Massachusetts-Bay, do hereby solemnly and mutually agree with each other, to form themselves into a free, sovereign, and independent body-politic or state, by the name of, <HI>The</HI> COMMONWEALTH of MASSACHU∣SETTS.</P>

<P N="2">II. No bill or resolve of the senate or house of represen∣tatives shall become a law, and have force as such, until it shall have been laid before the governor for his revisal: And if he, upon such revision, approve thereof, he shall signify his approbation by signing the same. But it he have any objection to the passing of such bill or resolve, he shall return the same, together with his objections thereto, in writing, to the senate or house of representatives, in which soever the same shall have originated; who shall enter the objec∣tions sent down by the governor, at large, on their records, and proceed to reconsider the said bill or resolve: But if af∣ter such reconsideration, two thirds of the said senate or house of representatives, shall, notwithstanding the said objec∣tions, agree to pass the same, it shall, together with the objections, be sent to the other branch of the legislature, where it shall also be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of the members present, it shall have the force of a law: But in all such cases, the votes of both houses shall be determined by yeas and nays; and the names of the per∣sons voting for, or against, the said bill or resolve, shall be entered upon the public records of the commonwealth.</P>
<P>And in order to prevent unnecessary delays, if any bill or
<PB N="16" REF="017390_0016_0FA111C503F824D0"/>
resolve shall not be returned by the governor within five days after it shall have been presented, the same shall have the force of a law.</P>
<P N="3">III. The general court shall forever have full power and authority to erect and constitute judicatories and courts of record, or other courts, to be held in the name of the com∣monwealth, for the hearing, trying, and determining of all manner of crimes, offences, pleas, processes, plaints, ac∣tions, matters, causes and things, whatsoever, arising or happening within the commonwealth, or between or con∣cerning persons inhabiting, or residing, or brought within the same; whether the same be criminal or civil, or whe∣ther the said crimes be capital or not capital, and whether the said pleas be real, personal, or mixt; and for the award∣ing and making out of execution thereupon: To which courts and judicatories are hereby given and granted full power and authority, from time to time, to administer oaths or affirmations, for the better discovery of truth in a∣ny matter in controversy or depending before them.</P>

<P>The selectmen of the several towns shall preside at such meetings impartially; and shall receive the votes of all the inhabitants of such towns present and qualified to vote for senators, and shall sort and count them in open town meet∣ing, and in presence of the town clerk, who shall make a

<P>And the inhabitants of plantations unincorporated, qua∣lified as this constitution provides, who are or shall be im∣powered and required to assess taxes upon themselves to∣ward the support of government, shall have the same pri∣vilege of voting for coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellors and senators in the planta∣tions where they reside, as town inhabitants have in their respective towns; and the plantation meetings for that pur∣pose shall be held annually on the same first Monday in A∣pril, at such place in the plantations respectively, as the as∣sessor thereof shall direct; which assessors shall have like au∣thority for notifying the electors, collecting and returning the votes, as the selectmen and town-clerks have in their several towns, by this constitution.

The senate shall be the final judge of the elections, returns and qualifications of their own members, as point∣ed out in the constitution; and shall, on the said last Wed∣nesday in May annually, determine and declare who are e∣lected by each district, to be senators by a majority of votes: And in case there shall not appear to be the full number of senators returned, elected by a majority of votes for any district, the deficiency shall be supplied in the follow∣ing manner, viz. The members of the house of repre∣sentatives, and such senators as shall be declared elected, shall take the names of such persons as shall be found to have the highest number of votes in such district, and not elected, amounting to twice the number of senators want∣ing, if there be so many voted for; and out of these, shall elect by ballot a number of senators sufficient to fill up the vacancies in such district; and in this manner all such vacan∣cies shall be filled in every district of the commonwealth; and in like manner all vacancies in the senate, arising by death, removal out of the state, or otherwise, shall be supplied as soon as may be, after such vacancies shall happen.</P>

<P N="9">IX. All judicial officers, the attorney-general, the soli∣citor-general, all sheriffs, coroners, and registers of pro∣bate, shall be nominated and appointed by the governor, by and with the advice and consent of the council; and every such nomination shall be made by the governor, and made at least seven days prior to such appointment.</P>
<P N="10">X.

<P>And no officer, duly commissioned to command in the militia, shall be removed from his office, but by the address of both houses to the governor, or by fair trial in court-martial, pursuant to the laws of the commonwealth for the time being.</P>
<P>The commanding officers of regiments shall appoint their adjutants and quartermasters; the brigadiers their brigade majors; and the major generals their aids; and the gover∣nor shall appoint the adjutant general.</P>
<P>The governor, with advice of council, shall appoint all officers of the continental army, whom by the confederati∣on of the United States it is provided that this common∣wealth, shall appoint, as also all officers of forts and garri∣sons.</P>
<P>The divisions of the militia into brigades, regiments and companies, made in pursuance of the militia laws now in force, shall be considered as the proper divisions of the mili∣tia of this commonwealth, until the same shall be altered in pursuance of some future law.</P>
<P N="11">XI. No monies shall be issued out of the treasury of this commonwealth, and disposed of (except such sums as may be appropriated for the redemption of bills of credit or trea∣surers notes, or for the payment of interests arising there∣on) but by warrant under the hand of the governor for the time being, with the advice and consent of the council, for the necessary defence and support of the commonwealth; and for the protection and preservation of the inhabitants there∣of, agreably to the acts and resolves of the general court.</P>
<P N="12">XII. All public boards, the commissary-general, all su∣perintending officers of public magazines and stores, be∣longing to this commonwealth, and all commanding offi∣cers
<PB N="29" REF="017390_0029_0FA111D58C2C93C0"/>
of sorts and garrisons within the same, shall once in e∣very three months, officially, and without requisition, and at other times, when required by the governor, deliver to him an account of all goods, stores, provisions, ammunition, cannon with their appendages, and small arms with their accoutrements, and of all other public property whatever under their care respectively; distinguishing the quantity, number, quality and kind of each, as particularly as may be; together with the condition of such sorts and garrisons: And the said commanding officer shall exhibit to the gover∣nor, when required by him, true and exact plans of such forts, and of the land and sea, or harbour or harbours adja∣cent.</P>
<P>And the said boards, and all public officers, shall com∣municate to the governor, as soon as may be after receiv∣ing the same, all letters, dispatches, and intelligence of a public nature, which shall be directed to them respectively.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. As the public good requires that the governor should not be under the undue influence of any of the mem∣bers of the general-court, by a dependance on them for his support—that he should in all cases, act with freedom for the benefit of the public—that he should not have his atten∣tion necessarily diverted from that object to his private con∣cerns—and that he should maintain the dignity of the com∣monwealth in the character of its chief magistrate—it is ne∣cessary that he should have an honourable stated salary, of a fixed and permanent value, amply sufficient for those pur∣poses, and established by standing laws: And it shall be a∣mong the first acts of the general court, after the com∣mencement of this constitution, to establish such salary by law accordingly.</P>
<P>Permanent and honourable salaries shall also be established by law for the justices of the supreme judicial court.</P>
<P>And if it shall be found that any of the salaries aforesaid, so established, are insufficient, they shall, from time to time, be enlar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d as the general-court shall judge proper.</P>

arrival there, after their first settlement amongst other our subjects in those parts, for the avoiding of discord, and those many evils which were likely to ensue upon those our subjects, not being able to bear in those remote parts, their different apprehensions in religious concernments; and in pursuance of the aforesaid ends, did once again leave their desirable stations and habitations, and with excessive labour and travel, hazard and charge, did transplant them∣selves into the midst of the indian natives, who, as we are informed, are the most potent princes and people of all that country; where, by the good providence of God, (from whom the plantations have taken their name) upon their labour and industry, they have not only been pre∣served to admiration, but have increased and prospered, and are seized and possessed, by purchase and consent of the said natives, to their full content, of such lands, islands, rivers, harbours, and roads, as are very convenient both for plantations, and also for building of ships, supply of pipe-s;taves, and other merchandise, and which ly very com∣modious in many respects for commerce, and to accomo∣date our southern plantations, and may much advance the trade of this our realm, and greatly enlarge the territories thereof; they having, by near neighbourhood to, and friendly society with, the great body of the Narraganset indians, given them encouragement, of their own accord, to subject themselves, their people and lands, unto us; whereby, as is hoped, there may, in time, by the blessing of God upon their endeavours, be laid a sure foundation of happiness to all America. And whereas, in their hum∣ble address, they have freely declared, That it is much on their hearts (if they be permitted) to hold forth a lively experiment, that a most flourishing civil state may stand, and best be maintained, and that among our English sub∣jects, with a full liberty in religious concernments, and that true piety, rightly grounded upon gospel principles, will give the best and greatest security to sovereignty, and will lay in the hearts of men the strongest obligations to true loyalty: Now, know ye, That we being willing to encourage the hopeful undertaking of our said loyal and

loving subjects, and to secure them in the free exercise and enjoyment of all their civil and religious rights ap∣pertaining to them, as our loving subjects; and to preserve unto them that liberty in the true Christian faith, and worship of God, which they have sought with so much travel, and with peaceable minds and loyal subjection to our royal progenitors, and ourselves to enjoy; and be∣cause some of the people and inhabitants of the same co∣lony cannot, in their private opinion, conform to the pub∣lic exercise of religion, according to the liturgy, form, and ceremonies of the church of England, or take or subscribe the oaths and articles made and established in that behalf; and for that the same, by reason of the remote distances of those places, will, as we hope, be no breach of the unity and uniformity established in this nation, have there∣fore thought fit, and do hereby publish, great, ordain, and declare, that our royal will and pleasure is, That no per∣son within the said colony, at any time hereafter, shall be any-wife molested, punished, disquieted, or called in ques∣tion, for any differences in opinion in matters of religion, who do not actually disturb the civil peace of our said co∣lony; but that all and every person and persons may, from time to time, and at all times hereafter, freely and fully have and enjoy his and their own judgments and consci∣ences, in matters of religious concernments, throughout the tract of land hereafter mentioned, they behaving them∣selves peaceably and quietly, and not using this liberty to licentiousness and profaneness, nor to the civil injury or outward disturbance of others, any law, statute or clause therein contained, or to be contained, usage, or custom of this realm, to the contrary hereof, in any wise not∣withstanding.

<P>Per Ipsum Regem.</P>
<P>[Since the commencement of hostilities by Great Bri∣tain, the state of Rhode-Island and Providence plantations has not assumed a form of government different from that contained in the foregoing charter. For in that, the king ceded to the governor and company, all powers, legisla∣tive, executive, and judicial, reserving to himself, as an acknowledgement of his sovereignty, a render of the fifth part of the gold and silver ore that should be found with∣in the territory. The governor, chief magistrates, and legislators are chosen by the freemen as usual, and all ju∣dicial and executive officers are annually elected by the governor and company, or upper and lower house of as∣sembly. All processes original and judicial, formerly is∣sued in the king's name, but they now issue in the name of the governor and company. The oaths of allegiance and of office are made conformable to the principles of the revolution. The governor, in his legislative capacity, can∣not give a negative to any act of the two houses; but, in common with the other magistrates, has one voice only.</P>
<P>The state is divided into five counties, in each of which there is a court of common pleas and general sessions of the peace, held twice every year, for the trial of all causes not capital, that arise within their limits; from which an appeal lies, to the superior court of judicature, court of assize and general jail delivery, whose jurisdiction extends over the whole state, and who also sit twice a year in each county. The constitution admits not of religious establishments, any farther than depends upon the voluntary choice of individu∣als. All men professing one Supreme Being, are equally protected by the laws, and no particular sect can claim pre∣eminence: From hence it is, that benevolence, hospitality, and undissembled honesty remarkably characterise the people.]</P>

<HEAD>CONNECTICUT. <HI>ACCOUNT</HI> of the <HI>CONSTITUTION</HI> of <HI>CONNECTICUT.</HI></HEAD>
<P>CONNECTICUT is divided into six counties, and each county is divided into a number of towns. Each town has a right to send two representatives to the gene∣ral court or assembly. The general court consists of two branches called the upper and lower house. The upper house is composed of the governor, deputy-governor, and twelve assistants or counsellors; and the lower house of the representatives of the several towns. This court has the sole power to make and repeal laws, grant levies, dis∣pose of lands belonging to the state, to particular towns and persons: to erect and stile judicatories and officers, as they shall see necessary for the good government of the people; and also to call to account any court, magistrate, or other officer, for any misdemeanor or mal-administra∣tion, and for just cause may fine, displace, or remove them, or deal otherwise, as the nature of the case shall require; and deal or act in any other matter that concerns the good of the state, except the election of governor, deputy-go∣vernor, assistants, treasurer, and secretary, which shall be done by the freemen at the yearly court of election, un∣less there be any vacancy by reason of death or other∣wise, after the election, which may be filled up by the general court. This court has power also, for reasons satisfactory to them, to grant suspension, release, and jail delivery upon reprieve, in capital and criminal cases. The general court has two stated sessions annually, on the second Thursdays of May and October.</P>
<P>The governor, or in his absence the deputy-governor, may call the assembly, on special emergencies, to meet
<PB N="60" REF="017390_0060_0FA111FAC1921D68"/>
at any other time. The governor, deputy-governor, as∣sistants, and secretary, are annually elected on the second Thursday in May. The representatives are newly cho∣sen for each stated session. The judges and justices are annually appointed by the general court; the same per∣sons are commonly re-appointed from time to time during their capacity to serve, unless guilty of misbehaviour. The sheriffs are appointed by the governor and council, with∣out limitation of time, but may be superseded by the au∣thority that appoints them. The governor for the time being is captain general of the militia; the deputy-gover∣nor, lieutenant-general; the other general officers, and the held officers are appointed by the general court, and commissioned by the governor. The captains and sub∣alterns are chosen by the vote of the company and hous∣holders li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng within the limits of the company; the person so chosen must be approved by the general court, and commissioned by the governor, before they have power to execute their offices. All the military officers hold their offices during the pleasure of the assembly, nor can they resign their commissions without leave of the captain-general, under penalty of doing duty in the ranks as private soldiers.</P>
<P>The mode of electing the governor, deputy-governor, assistants, treasurer, and secretary is, that the freemen in the several towns meet on the Monday next after the first Tuesday in April annually (being the day appointed by law for that purpose, and choosing representatives) and give in their votes for the persons they choose for said of∣fices respectively, with their names written on a piece of paper, which votes are received and sealed up by a con∣stable in the freemen's meeting; the votes for each of said offices in a different paper, writing on the outside the name of the town, and the office for which the votes are given in, which are sent by the representativss to the ge∣neral court, to be held on the second Thursday of May next ensuing; at which time, after the house of repre∣sentatives have chosen a speaker and clerk, a committee is chosen of members of both houses, to sort and count the
<PB N="61" REF="017390_0061_0FA111FB08536C88"/>
votes, and declare the names of the persons chosen to said offices. Any freemen qualified to vote for representatives, &amp;c. may be elected to any office in the government. In choosing assistants twenty persons are nominated by the votes of the freemen, given in at their meeting for choos∣ing representatives in September annually, and sealed up and sent to the general court in October then next, which are counted by a committee of both houses, and the twenty persons who have the greatest number of votes stand in nomination, out of which number twelve are to be chosen assistants by the freemen, the next April, in man∣ner afore described.</P>
<P>The qualifications requisite to entitle a person to vote in election of the officers of government are, maturity in years, quiet and peaceable behaviour, a civil conversation, and forty shillings freehold, or forty pounds personal estate; if the selectmen of the town certify a person qualified in those respects, he is admitted a freemen, on his taking an oath of fidelity to the state.</P>
<P>The names of all that are thus admitted, are inrolled in the town-clerk's office, and continue freemen during life, unless disfranchised by a sentence of the superior court on conviction of a misdemeanour.</P>
<P>The governor or in his absence the deputy governor in the upper house, and the speaker in the lower house of assembly, have a casting voice when the members of the respective houses, including the governor and speaker, are equally divided in opinion on any question.</P>
<P>There is in this state a superior court, consisting of one chief judge and four other judges, which have authority in all criminal cases, extending to life, limb, and banish∣ment, and to hear and determine all civil actions brought by appeal from the county courts, or on writs of error. This court also hath authority in all matters of divorce. There are two stated sessions of the superior court in each county annually.</P>
<P>There are also county courts held in the several coun∣ties, consisting of one judge and four justices of the quo∣rum, who have jurisdiction in all criminal cases, arising
<PB N="62" REF="017390_0062_0FA111FBD9B09190"/>
within their respective counties, where the punishment does not extend to life, limb, or banishment. The coun∣ty courts also have original jurisdiction in all civil actions wherein the demand exceeds forty shillings.</P>
<P>The superior and county courts try matters of fact by a jury, according to the course of the common law.</P>
<P>Justices of the peace have authority to hear and deter∣mine civil actions where the demand does not exceed forty shillings. They also have authority in some cases of a cri∣minal nature, punishable by fine not exceeding forty shil∣lings, or whipping not exceeding ten stripes, or sitting in the stocks.</P>
<P>This state is also divided into a number of probate dis∣tricts, less than counties; in each of which is appointed a judge for the probate of wills, granting administration on intestate estates, appointing guardians for minors, or∣dering distribution of intestate estates, &amp;c. An appeal lies from any decree of this court to the superior court.</P>
<P>The superior, county, and probate courts appoint their respective clerks.</P>
<P>The general court has till very lately been the only court of chancery in this state. But by a late law, the county courts determine matters of equity from five pounds to two hundred pounds value; the superior court from two hundred to eight hundred pounds value; and the ge∣neral assembly all cases exceeding the last mentioned sum.</P>
<P>All attornies at law are admitted and sworn by the county courts; there is no attorney general, but there used to be one king's attorney in each county, but since the king has abdicated the government, they are now at∣tornies to the governor and company.</P>

<HEAD>NEW-YORK. The <HI>CONSTITUTION</HI> of the State of <HI>New-York.</HI> Established by the <HI>CONVENTION,</HI> authorised and empow∣ered for that Purpose, April <HI>20. 1777.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THIS convention, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this state, doth ordain, de∣termine, and declare, that no authority shall, on any pre∣tence whatever, be exercised over the people or members of this state, but such as shall be derived from and granted by them.</P>
<P N="2">2. This convention doth further, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this state, ordain determine, and declare, that the supreme legislative power, within this state, shall be vested in two seperate and distinct bodies of men; the one to be called, <HI>The Assembly of the State of New-York</HI>; the other to be called, <HI>The Senate of the State of New-York</HI>; who together shall form the legislature, and meet once at least in every year for the dispatch of business.</P>
<P N="3">3. And whereas, laws inconsistent with the spirit of this constitution, or with the public good, may be hastily and unadvisedly passed; be it ordained that the governor for the time being, the chancellor, and the judges of the supreme court, or any two of them, together with the governor, shall be, and hereby are, constituted a council to revise all bills about to be passed into laws by the legislature, and for that purpose shall assemble themselves, from time to time, when the legislature shall be convened; for which never∣theless, they shall not receive any salary or considera∣tion, under any pretence whatever. And that all bills, which have passed the senate and assembly, shall, before they become laws, be presented to the said council for their
<PB N="64" REF="017390_0064_0FA111FD5A74DB90"/>
revisal and consideration; and if upon such revision and con∣sideration, it should appear improper to the said council, or a majority of them, that the said bill should become a law of this state, that they return the same, together with their ob∣jections thereto in writing, to the senate or house of assem∣bly, in whichsoever the same shall have originated, who shall enter the objections sent down by the council, at large, in their minutes, and proceed to reconsider the said bill. But if after such reconsideration, two thirds of the said se∣nate or house of assembly, shall, notwithstanding the said objections, agree to pass the same, it shall, together with the objections, be sent to the other branch of the legislature, where it shall also be re-considered, and if approved by two thirds of the members present shall be a law.</P>
<P>And in order to prevent any unnecessary delays, be it further ordained, that if any bill shall not be returned by the council within ten days after it shall have been present∣ed, the same shall be a law, unless the legislature shall, by their adjournment, render a return of the said bill within ten days impracticable; in which case the bill shall be returned on the first day of the meeting of the legislature, after the expiration of the said ten days.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the assembly shall consist of at least seventy members, to be annually chosen in the several counties in in the proportions following, viz.</P>

That as soon after the expiration of seven years, sub∣sequent to the termination of the present war as may be, a census of the electors and inhabitants in this state be taken, under the direction of the legislature. And if on such cen∣sus, it shall appear, that the number of representatives in as∣sembly from the said counties, is not justly proportioned to the number of electors in the said counties respectively, that the legislature do adjust and apportion the same by that rule. And further, that once in every seven years, after the tak∣ing of the said first census, a just account of the electors re∣sident in each county shall be taken; and if it shall there∣upon appear, that the number of electors in any county, shall have increased or diminished one or more seventieth parts of the whole number of electors, which on the said first census shall be found in this state, the number of repre∣sentatives for such county shall be increased or diminished accordingly, that is to say, one representative for every se∣ventieth part as aforesaid.</P>
<P N="6">6. And whereas, an opinion hath long prevailed among divers of the good people of this state, that voting at electi∣ons by ballot, would tend more to preserve the liberty and equal freedom of the people than voting <HI>viva voce.</HI> To the end therefore, that a fair experiment be made, which of those two methods of voting is to be preferred:</P>
<P>Be it ordained, that as soon as may be, after the termi∣nation of the present war, between the United States of Ame∣rica and Great-Britain, an act, or acts be passed by the le∣gislature of this state, for causing all elections thereafter to be held in this state, for senators and representatives in as∣sembly, to be by ballot, and directing the manner in which the same shall be conducted. And whereas, it is possible, that after all the care of the legislature, in framing the said act or acts, certain inconveniencies and mischiefs, unfore∣seen at this day, may be found to attend the said mode of electing by ballot:</P>
<P>It is further ordained, that if after a full and fair experi∣ment shall be made of voting by ballot aforesaid, the same shall be found less conducive to the safety or interest of the state, than the method of voting <HI>viva voce,</HI> it shall be law∣ful
<PB N="66" REF="017390_0066_0FA111FEC5EEA188"/>
and constitutional for the legislature to abolish the same; provided two thirds of the members present in each house, respectively shall concur therein: And further, that, dur∣ing the continuance of the present war, and until the legis∣lature of this state shall provide for the election of senators and representatives in assembly by ballot, the said elections shall be made <HI>viva voce.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. That every male inhabitant of full age, who shall have personally resided within one of the counties of this state, for six months immediately preceeding the day of elec∣on, shall, at such election, be intitled to vote for represen∣tatives of the said county in assembly; if, during the time aforesaid he shall have been a freeholder, possessing a free-hold of the value of twenty pounds, within the said county, or have rented a tenement therein of the yearly value of for∣ty shillings, and been rated and actually paid taxes to this state: Provided always, that every person who now is a freemen of the city of Albany, or who was made a free∣man of the city of New-York, on or before the fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand se∣ven hundred and seventy-five, and shall be actually and u∣sually resident in the said cities respectively, shall be entitled to vote for representatives in assembly within his said place of residence.</P>
<P N="8">8. That every elector, before he is admitted to vote, shall, if required by the returning officer or either of the inspectors, take an oath, or if of the people called Quakers, an affirmation, of allegiance to the state.</P>
<P N="9">9. That the assembly thus constituted shall choose their own speaker, be judges of their own members, and enjoy the same privileges and proceed in doing business, in like manner as the assemblies of the colony of New-York of <HI>right</HI> formerly did; and that a majority of the said mem∣bers shall, from time to time, constitute a house to proceed upon business.</P>
<P N="10">10. And this convention doth further, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this state, ordain, determine and declare, that the senate of the state of New-York shall consist of twenty-four freeholders, to be chosen
<PB N="67" REF="017390_0067_0FA1120187B56F38"/>
out of the body of the freeholders, and that they be chosen by the freeholders of this state, possessed of freeholds of the value of one hundred pounds, over and above all debts charged thereon.</P>
<P N="11">11. That the members of the senate be elected for four years, and immediately after the first election, they be divided by lot into four classes, six in each class, and numbered one, two, three and four; that the seats of the members of the first class shall be vacated at the expira∣tion of the first year, the second class the second year, and so on continually; to the end that the fourth part of the senate, as nearly as possible, may be annually chosen.</P>
<P N="12">12. That the election of senators shall be after this man∣ner; that so much of this state as is now parcelled into counties, be divided into four great districts; the southern district to comprehend the city and county of New-York, Suffolk, Westchester, Kings, Queens, and Richmond counties, the middle district to comprehend the counties of Dutchess, Ulster and Orange; the western district, the city and county of Albany, and Tryon county; and the eastern district, the counties of Charlotte, Cumber∣land, and Gloucester. That the senators shall be elected by the freeholders of the said districts, qualified as afore∣said, in the proportions following, <HI>to wit,</HI> in the southern district nine, in the middle district six, in the western dis∣trict six, and in the eastern district three. And be it or∣dained, that a census shall be taken as soon as may be, after the expiration of seven years from the termination of the present war, under the direction of the legislature: And if on such census it shall appear, that the number of senators is not justly proportioned to the several districts, that the legislature adjust the proportion as near as may be, to the number of freeholders qualified as aforesaid, in each district. That when the number of electors, within any of the said districts, shall have increased one twenty-fourth part of the whole number of electors, which, by the said census, shall be found to be in this state, an ad∣ditional senator shall be chosen by the electors of such dis∣trict. That a majority of the number of senators to be
<PB N="68" REF="017390_0068_0FA11204D5CF34C8"/>
chosen as aforesaid, shall be necessary to constitute a se∣nate sufficient to proceed upon business, and that the se∣nate shall, in like manner with the assembly, be the judges of its own members. And be it ordained, that it shall be in the power of the future legislatures of this state, for the convenience and advantage of the good people thereof, to divide the same into such further and other counties and districts, as shall to them appear necessary.</P>
<P N="13">13. And this convention doth further, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this state, ordain, determine and declare, that no member of this state shall be disfranchised, or deprived of any of the rights or privi∣leges secured to the subjects of this state, by this constitu∣tion, unless by the law of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</P>
<P N="14">14. That neither the assembly nor the senate shall have power to adjourn themselves for any longer time than two days, without the mutual consent of both.</P>
<P N="15">15. That whenever the assembly and senate disagree, a conference shall be held in the presence of both, and be managed by committees to be by them respectively chosen by ballot. That the doors both of the senate and assem∣bly, shall at all times be kept open to all persons, except when the welfare of the state shall require their debates to be kept secret. And the journals of all their proceed∣ings shall be kept in the manner heretofore accustomed by the general assembly of the colony of New-York, and except such parts as they shall, as aforesaid, respectively determine not to make public, be from day to day (if the business of the legislature will permit) published.</P>
<P N="16">16. It is nevertheless provided, that the number of se∣nators shall never exceed one hundred, nor the number of assembly three hundred; but that whenever the number of senators shall amount to one hundred, or of the assem∣bly to three hundred, then and in such case, the legisla∣ture shall from time to time thereafter, by laws for that purpose, apportion and distribute the said one hundred se∣nators, and three hundred representatives, among the great districts and counties of this state, in proportion to
<PB N="69" REF="017390_0069_0FA11205F15D8ED8"/>
the number of their respective electors; so that the repre∣sentation of the good people of this state, both in the se∣nate and assembly, shall for ever remain proportionate and adequate.</P>
<P N="17">17. And this convention doth further, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this state, ordain, determine, and declare, that the supreme executive power and authority of this state shall be vested in a governor; and that statedly once in every three years, and as often as the seat of government shall become vacant, a wise and discreet freeholder of this state shall be by ballot elected governor, by the freeholders of this state, qualified as before described to elect senators; which elections shall be always held at the times and places of choosing repre∣sentatives in assembly for each respective county; and that the person who hath the greatest number of votes within the said state, shall be governor thereof.</P>

<P>And in case of the impeachment of the governor, or his removal from office, death, resignation, or absence from the state, the lieutenant-governor shall exercise all the power and authority appertaining to the office of gover∣nor, until another be chosen, or the governor absent or impeached, shall return or be acquitted. Provided, that where the governor shall, with the consent of the legis∣lature, be out of the state, in time of war, at the head of a military force thereof, he shall still continue in his command of all the military force of the state, both by sea and land.</P>
<P N="21">21. That whenever the government shall be admini∣stered by the lieutenant-governor, or he shall be unable to attend as president of the senate, the senators shall have power to elect one of their own members to the office of president of the senate, which he shall exercise <HI>pro hac vice.</HI> And if, during such vacancy of the office or gover∣nor, the lieutenant-governor shall be impeached, displaced, resign, die, or be absent from the state, the president of the senate shall in like manner as the lieutenant-governor, administer the government, until others shall be elected by the suffrage of the people, at the succeeding election.</P>
<P N="22">22. And this convention doth further, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this state, ordain, determine and declare, that the treasurer of this state shall be appointed by act of the legislature, to originate with the assembly: Provided, that he shall not be elected out of either branch of the legislature.</P>

<P N="37">37. And whereas it is of great importance to the safety of this state, that peace and amity with the indians within the same, be at all times supported and maintained. And whereas, the frauds too often practised towards the said in∣dians, in contracts made for their lands, have in divers in∣stances been productive of dangerous discontents and ani∣mosities; Be it ordained, that no purchases or contracts for the sale of lands made since the fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, or which may hereafter be made with or of the said indians, within the limits of this state, shall be binding on the said indians, or deemed valid, unless made under the authority, and with the consent of the legislature of this state.</P>

<P N="39">39. And whereas the ministers of the gospel, are by their profession dedicated to the service of God and the cure of souls, and ought not to be diverted from the great du∣ties of their function; therefore no minister of the gospel, or priest of any denomination whatsoever, shall at any time hereafter, under any pretence or description whatever, be eligible to, or capable of holding any civil or military of∣fice or place, within this state.</P>
<P N="40">40. And whereas it is of the utmost importance to the safety of every state, that it should always be in a condition of defence; and it is the duty of every man, who enjoys the protection of society, to be prepared and willing to de∣fend it; this convention, therefore, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this state, doth ordain, de∣termine and declare, that the militia of this state, at all times hereafter, as well in peace as in war, shall be armed and disciplined, and in readiness for service. That all such of the inhabitants of this state, being of the people called Quakers, from scruples of conscience, may be averse to the bearing of arms, be therefrom excused by the legislature; and do pay to the state, such sums of money in lieu of their personal service, as the same may, in the judgment of the legislature, be worth: And that a proper magazine of warlike stores, proportionate to the number of inhabitants, be, forever hereafter, at the expence of this state, and by acts of the legislature, established, maintained, and conti∣nued in every county in this state.</P>
<P N="41">41. And this convention doth further ordain, determine and declare, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this state, that trial by jury, in all cases in which it hath heretofore been used in the colony of New-York, shall be established, and remain inviolate forever. And that no acts of attainder shall be passed by the legislature of this state for crimes, other than those committed before the

And this convention doth further, in the name and by the authority of the good people or this state, ordain, de∣termine and declare, that it shall be in the discretion of the legislature to naturalize all such persons, and in such manner as they shall think proper; provided all such of the persons, so to be by them naturalized, as being born in parts be∣yond sea, and out of the United States of America, shall come to settle in, and become subjects of this state, shall take an oath of allegiance to this state, and abjure and re∣nounce all allegience and subjection to all and every foreign king, prince, potentate and state, in all matters ecclesiastical as well as civil.</P>

<HEAD>NEW-JERSEY. <HI>CONSTITUTION</HI> of <HI>NEW-JERSEY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS all the constitutional authority ever pos∣sessed by the kings of Great-Britain over these colo∣nies, or their other dominions was, by compact derived from the people, and held of them for the common interest of the whole society, allegiance and protection are, in the nature of things, reciprocal ties, each equally depending upon the other, and liable to be dissolved by the other's being refus∣ed or withdrawn. And whereas George the third, king of Great-Britain, has refused protection to the good people of these colonies; and, by assenting to sundry acts of the British parliament, attempted to subject them to the abso∣lute dominion of that body; and has also made war upon them in the most cruel and unnatural manner, for no other cause than asserting their just rights, all civil authority under him is necessarily at an end, and a dissolution of government in each colony has consequently taken place.</P>
<P>And whereas in the present deplorable situation of these colonies, exposed to the fury of a cruel and relentless ene∣my, some form of government is absolutely necessary, not only for the preservation of good order, but also the more effectually to unite the people, and enable them to exert their whole force in their own necessary defence; and as the honourable the continental congress, the supreme coun∣cil of the American colonies, has advised such of the colo∣nies as have not yet gone into the measure, to adopt for themselves respectively, such government as shall best con∣duce to their own happiness and safety, and the well-being of America in general: We, the representatives of the co∣lony of New-Jersey, having been elected by all the coun∣ties in the freest manner, and in congress assembled, have,
<PB N="79" REF="017390_0079_0FA1121144919610"/>
after mature deliberations, agreed upon a sett of charter rights, and the form of a constitution, in manner following, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1 That the government of this province shall be vested in a governor, legislative council, and general assembly.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the legislative council and general assembly shall be chosen, for the first time, on the second Tuesday in August next; the members whereof shall be the same in number and qualifications as is herein after mentioned; and shall be and remain vested with all the powers and authority to be held by any future legislative council and assembly of this colony, until the second Tuesday in October, which shall be in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-seven.</P>
<P N="3">3. That on the second Tuesday in October yearly, and every year for ever (with the privilege of adjourning from day to day, as occasion may require) the counties shall se∣verally choose one person to be a member of the legislative council of this colony, who shall be and have been for one whole year next before the election, an inhabitant and free∣holder in the county in which he is chosen, and worth at least one thousand pounds, proclamation money, of real and personal estate within the same county: that, at the same time, each county shall also choose three members of assembly; provided, that no person shall be entitled to a seat in the said assembly, unless he be and have been for one whole year next before the election, an inhabitant of the county he is to represent, and worth five hundred pounds pro∣clamation money in real and personal estate, in the same county: that on the second Tuesday next after the day of election, the council and assembly shall separately meet; and that the con∣sent of both houses shall be necessary to every law; provid∣ed, that seven shall be a quorum of the council for doing business, and that no law shall pass, unless there be a ma∣jority of all the representatives of each body personally pre∣sent, and agreeing thereto. Provided always, that if a ma∣jority of the representatives of this province, in council and general assembly convened, shall, at any time or times here∣after, judge it equitable and proper to add to or diminish the
<PB N="80" REF="017390_0080_0FA11212C26524D8"/>
number or proportion of the members of assembly for any county or counties in this colony, then, and in such case, the same may, on the principles of more equal representa∣tion, be lawfully done, any thing in this charter to the con∣trary notwithstanding, so that the whole number of repre∣sentatives in assembly shall not at any time be less than thirty nine.</P>
<P N="4">4. That all inhabitants of this colony of full age, who are worth fifty pounds, proclamation money, clear estate in the same, and have resided within the county in which they claim a vote, for twelve months immediately preceding the election, shall be entitled to vote for representatives in coun∣cil and assembly; and also for all other public officers that shall be elected by the people of the county at large.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the assembly, when met, shall have power to choose a speaker, and other their officers; to be judges of the qualifications and elections of their own members; sit upon their own adjournments; prepare bills to be passed into laws; and to empower their speaker to convene them, when∣ever any extraordinary occurrence shall render it necessary.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the council shall also have power to prepare bills to pass into laws, and have other like powers as the assem∣bly, and in all respects to be a free and independent branch of the legislature of this colony; save only, that they shall not prepare or alter any money bill, which shall be the pri∣vilege of the assembly, that the council shall, from time to time, be convened by the governor or vice-president, but must be convened at all times when the assembly sits; for which purpose the speaker of the house of assembly shall al∣ways immediately after an adjournment give notice to the governor or vice-president, of the time and place to which the house is adjourned.</P>
<P N="7">7. That the council and assembly jointly, at the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r first meeting after each annual election, shall, by a majority of votes, elect some fit person within the colony to be governor for one year, who shall be constant president of the council, and have a casting vote in their proceedings; and that the council themselves shall choose a vice-president, who shall act as such in the absence of the governor.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="81" REF="017390_0081_0FA11214DA8FCA18"/>8. That the governor, or in his absence, the vice-pre∣sident of the council, shall have the supreme executive power, be chancellor of the colony, and act as captain-general and commander in chief of all the militia and other military force in this colony; and that any three or more of the council shall, at all times, be a privy-council to consult them; and that the governor be ordinary or sur∣rogate-general.</P>
<P N="9">9. That the governor and council, (seven whereof shall be a quorum) be the court of appeals in the last resort in all clauses of law, as heretofore; and that they possess the power of granting pardons to criminals after condem∣nation, in all cases of treason, felony, or other offences.</P>
<P N="10">10. That captains, and all other inferior officers of the militia, shall be chosen by the companies in the respec∣tive counties; but field and general officers by the council and assembly.</P>
<P N="11">11. That the council and assembly shall have power to make the great seal of this colony, which shall be kept by the governor, or, in his absence, by the vice-president of the council, to be used by them, as occasion may require; and it shall be called, <HI>The great seal of the colony of New-Jersey.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. That the judges of the supreme court shall conti∣nue in office for seven years; the judges of the inferior court of common pleas in the several counties, iustices of the peace, clerks of the supreme court, clerks of the infe∣rior court of common pleas and quarter sessions, the at∣torney-general, and provincial secretary, shall continue in office for five years, and the provincial treasurer shall conti∣nue in office for one year; and that they shall be severally appointed by the council and assembly in manner aforesaid, and commissioned by the governor, or in his absence the vice-president of the council. Provided always, that the said officers severally, shall be capable of being re-appoint∣ed at the end of the terms severally before limited; and that any of the said officers shall be liable to be dismissed, when adjudged guilty of misbehaviour, by the council on an impeachment of the assembly.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="82" REF="017390_0082_0FA112154ABF0D88"/>13. That the inhabitants of each county, qualified to vote as aforesaid, shall, at the time and place of electing their representatives, annually elect one sheriff, and one or more coroners; and that they may re-elect the same person to such offices until he shall have served three years, but no longer; after which three years must elapse before the same person is capable of being elected again. When the election is certified to the governor or vice-president, under the hands of six freeholders of the county for which they were elected, they shall be immediately commission∣ed to serve in their respective offices.</P>
<P N="14">14. That the townships, at their annual town meetings for electing other officers, shall chuse constables for the districts respectively; and also three or more judicious free∣holders of good character, to hear and finally determine all appeals relative to unjust assessments in cases of public taxation; which commissioners of appeal shall, for that purpose, sit at some suitable time or times to be by them appointed, and made known to the people by advertise∣ments.</P>
<P N="15">15.

<HEAD>PENNSYLVANIA. The <HI>CONSTITUTION</HI> of the Commonwealth of <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> as established by the <HI>GENERAL CONVEN∣TION,</HI> elected for that Purpose, and held at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> July <HI>15, 1776,</HI> and continued by Adjournments to Sept. <HI>28, 1776.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS all government ought to be instituted and supported for the security and protection of the community as such, and to enable the individuals who compose it to enjoy their natural rights, and the other blessings which the author of existence has bestowed upon man; and whenever these great ends of government are not obtained, the people have a right, by common con∣sent to change it, and take such measures as to them may appear necessary to promote their safety and happiness. And whereas the inhabitants of this commonwealth have, in consideration of protection only, heretofore acknow∣ledged allegiance to the king of Great-Britain, and the said king has not only withdrawn that protection, but commenced, and still continues to carry on, with una∣bated vengeance, a most cruel and unjust war against them, employing therein, not only the troops of Great-Britain, but foreign mercenaries, savages, and slaves, for the avow∣ed purpose of reducing them to a total and abject sub∣mission, to the despotic domination of the British parlia∣ment, with many other acts of tyranny, (more fully set forth in the declaration of congress) whereby all allegi∣ance and fealty to the said king and his successors, are dissolved and at an end, and all power and authority de∣rived
<PB N="86" REF="017390_0086_0FA11218453999C8"/>
from him ceased in these colonies. And whereas it is absolutely necessary for the welfare and safety of the in∣habitants of said colonies, that they be henceforth free and independent states, and that just, permanent, and proper forms of government exist in every part of them, derived from and founded on the authority of the people only, agreeable to the directions of the honourable American congress. We, the representatives of the freemen of Penn∣sylvania, in general convention met, for the express pur∣pose of framing such a government, confessing the good∣ness of the great Governor of the universe (who alone knows to what degree of earthly happiness mankind may attain, by perfecting the arts of government) in permit∣ting the people of this state, by common consent, and without violence, deliberately to form for themselves such just rules as they shall think best, for governing their fu∣ture society; and being fully convinced, that it is our in∣dispensible duty to establish such original principles of go∣vernment, as will best promote the general happiness of the people of this state, and their posterity, and provide for future improvements, without partiality for, or pre∣judice against any particular class, sect, or denomination of men whatever, do, by virtue of the authority vested in us by our constituents, ordain, declare, and establish, the following <HI>Declaration of Rights,</HI> and <HI>Frame of Govern∣ment,</HI> to be the CONSTITUTION of this commonwealth, and to remain in force therein for ever, unaltered, except in such articles as shall hereafter on experience be found to require improvement, and which shall by the same au∣thority of the people, fairly delegated as this frame of go∣vernment directs, be amended or improved for the more effectual obtaining and securing the great end and design of all government, herein before mentioned.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> A DECLARATION of the RIGHTS of the Inhabitants of the State of <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THAT all men are born equally free and independ∣ent, and have certain natural, inherent, and un∣alienable rights, amongst which are, the enjoying and de∣fending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and protec∣ting property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.</P>
<P N="2">2. That all men have a natural and unalienable right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences and understanding: And that no man ought, or of right can be compelled to attend any religi∣ous worship, or erect or support any place of worship, or maintain any ministry, contrary to, or against, his own free will and consent: Nor can any man, who acknow∣ledges the being of a God, be justly deprived or abridged of any civil right as a citizen, on account of his religious sentiments, or peculiar mode of religious worship: And that no authority can or ought to be vested in, or assum∣ed by any power whatever, that shall in any case interfere with, or in any manner controul, the right of conscience in the free exercise of religious worship.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the people of this state have the sole, exclusive, and inherent right of governing and regulating the internal police of the same.</P>
<P N="4">4. That all power being originally inherent in, and con∣sequently derived from, the people; therefore all officers of government, whether legislative or executive, are their trustees and servants, and at all times accountable to them.</P>
<P N="5">5. That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit, protection, and security of the people, nation, or community; and not for the particular emolu∣ment or advantage of any single man, family, or set of men, who are a part only of that community: And that the community hath an undubitable, inalienable, and inde∣feasible
<PB N="88" REF="017390_0088_0FA1121F249693C0"/>
right to reform, alter, or abolish government in such manner, as shall be by that community judged most condu∣cive to the public weal.</P>
<P N="6">6. That those who are employed in the legislative and executive business of the state may be restrained from op∣pression, the people have a right, at such periods as they may think proper, to reduce their public officers to a pri∣vate station, and supply the vacancies by certain and regu∣lar elections.</P>
<P N="7">7. That all elections ought to be free; and that all free men having a sufficient evident common interest with, and attachment to the community, have a right to elect officers, or be elected into office.</P>
<P N="8">8. That every member of society hath a right to be pro∣tected in the enjoyment of life, liberty, and property, and therefore is bound to contribute his proportion towards the expence of that protection, and yield his personal service, when necessary, or an equivalent thereto: But no part of a mans property can be justly taken from him, or applied to public uses, without his own consent, or that of his legal representatives: Nor can any man who is conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms, be justly compelled thereto, if he will pay such equivalent: Nor are the people bound by any laws, but such as they have in like manner assented to, for their common good.</P>
<P N="9">9. That in all prosecutions for criminal offences, a man hath a right to be heard by himself and his council, to de∣mand the cause and nature of his accusation, to be confront∣ed with the witnesses, to call for evidence in his favour, and a speedy public trial, by an impartial jury of the country, without the unanimous consent of which jury he cannot be found guilty: Nor can he be compelled to give evidence a∣gainst himself: Nor can any man be justly deprived of his liberty except by the laws of the land, or the judgment of his peers.</P>
<P N="10">10. That the people have a right to hold themselves their houses, papers, and possessions free from search or seizure; and therefore warrants without oaths or affirmations first made, affording a sufficient foundation for them, and where∣by
<PB N="89" REF="017390_0089_0FA11220582073E0"/>
any officer or messenger may be commanded or required to search suspected places, or to seize any person or persons, his or their property, not particularly described, are contrary to that right and ought not to be granted.</P>
<P N="11">11. That in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man and man, the parties have a right to tri∣al by jury, which ought to be held sacred.</P>
<P N="12">12. That the people have a right to freedom of speech, and of writing, and publishing their sentiments; therefore the freedom of the press ought not to be restrained.</P>
<P N="13">13. That the people have a right to bear arms for the de∣fence of themselves and the state; and as standing armies in the time of peace, are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up: And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.</P>
<P N="14">14. That a frequent recurrence to fundamental princi∣ples, and a firm adherence to justice, moderation, tempe∣rance industry, and frugality, are absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty, and keep a government free: The people ought therefore to pay particular attention to these points in the choice of officers and representatives, and have a right to exact a due and constant regard to them, from their legislators and magistrates, in the making and executing such laws as are necessary for the good government of the state.</P>
<P N="15">15. That all men have a natural inherent right to emi∣grate from one state to another that will receive them, or to form a new state in vacant countries, or in such coun∣tries as they can purchase, whenever they think that there∣by they may promote their own happiness.</P>
<P N="16">16. That the people have a right to assemble together, to consult for their common good, to instruct their repre∣sentatives, and to apply to the legislature for redress of griev∣ances, by address, petition, or remonstrance.</P>

<HEAD>MARYLAND. A <HI>DECLARATION</HI> of <HI>RIGHTS,</HI> and the <HI>CONSTITU∣TION</HI> and <HI>FORM</HI> of <HI>GOVERNMENT,</HI> agreed to by the <HI>Delegates</HI> of <HI>Maryland,</HI> in free and full <HI>CONVENTION</HI> assembled.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="declaration of rights">
<HEAD>A DECLARATION of RIGHTS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE parliament of Great-Britain, by a declaratory act, having assumed a right to make laws to bind the co∣lonies in all cases whatsoever, and in pursuance of such claim endeavoured by force of arms to subjugate the united colonies to an unconditional submission to their will and power, and having at length constrained them to declare themselves in∣dependent states, and to assume government under the au∣thority of the people. Therefore, we, the delegates of Maryland, in free and full convention assembled, taking into our most serious consideration the best means of esta∣blishing a good constitution in this state, for the sure foun∣dation and more permanent security thereof, declare,</P>
<P N="1">1. That all government of right originates from the peo∣ple, is founded in compact only, and instituted solely for the good of the whole.</P>
<P N="2">2 That the people of this state ought to have the sole and exclusive right of regulating the internal government and po∣lice thereof.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the inhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the common law of England, and the trial by jury, according to the course of that law, and to the benefit of such of the English statutes, as existed at the time of their first emigra∣tion, and which by experience have been found applicable
<PB N="117" REF="017390_0117_0FA1113E06B3FCF8"/>
to their local and other circumstances, and of such others as have been since made in England, or Great-Britain, and have been introduced, used, and practised, by the courts of law or equity; and also to all acts of assembly in force on the first of June seventeen hundred and seventy-four, ex∣cept such as may have since expired, or have been, or may be altered by acts of convention, or this declaration of rights, subject nevertheless to the revision of, and amendment or re∣peal by, the legislature of this state; and the inhabitants of Maryland are also entitled to all property derived to them from or under the charter granted by his majesty Charles I. to Caecilius Calvert, baron of Baltimore.</P>
<P N="4">4. That all persons invested with the legislative or exe∣cutive powers of government are the trustees of the public, and as such accountable for their conduct: wherefore, when∣ever the ends of government are perverted, and public li∣berty manifestly endangered, and all other means of redress are ineffectual, the people may, and of right ought, to re∣form the old or establish a new government; the doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary power and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the right in the people to participate in the legis∣lature is the best security of liberty, and the foundation of all free government; for this purpose, elections ought to be free and frequent, and every man having property in, a common interest with, and attachment to the community, ought to have a right of suffrage.</P>
<P N="6">6. That the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of government, ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other.</P>
<P N="7">7. That no power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, unless by, or derived from the legislature, ought to be exercised or allowed.</P>
<P N="8">8. That freedom of speech and debates, or proceedings in the legislature, ought not to be impeached in any other court or judicature.</P>
<P N="9">9. That a place for the meeting of the legislature ought to be fixed, the most convenient to the members thereof,
<PB N="118" REF="017390_0118_0FA1113EC6ECB098"/>
and to the depository of public records, and the legislature ought not to be convened or held at any other place, but from evident necessity.</P>
<P N="10">10. That for redress of grievances, and for amending, strengthening and preserving the laws, the legislature ought to be frequently convened.</P>
<P N="11">11. That every man hath a right to petition the legisla∣ture for the redress of grievances, in a peaceable and order∣ly manner.</P>
<P N="12">12. That no aid, charge, tax, fee or fees, ought to be set, rated, or levied, under any pretence, without consent of the legislature.</P>
<P N="13">13. That the levying taxes by the poll is grievous and oppressive, and ought to be abolished; that paupers ought not to be assessed for the support of government, but every other person in the state ought to contribute his pro∣portion of public taxes for the support of government, ac∣cording to his actual worth in real or personal property with∣in the state; yet fines, duties, or taxes, may properly and justly be imposed or laid with a political view for the good government and benefit of the community.</P>
<P N="14">14. That sanguinary laws ought to be avoided, as far as is consistent with the safety of the state; and no law to in∣flict cruel and unusual pains and penalties ought to be made in any case, or at any time hereafter.</P>
<P N="15">15. That retrospective laws, punishing facts committed before the existence of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust, and incompatible with liber∣ty, wherefore no <HI>ex post facto</HI> law ought to be made.</P>
<P N="16">16. That no law to attaint particular persons of treason or felony ought to be made in any case, or any time here∣after.</P>
<P N="17">17. That every freeman, for any injury done him in his person or property, ought to have remedy by the course of the law of the land, and ought to have justice and right, freely without sale, fully without any denial, and speedily without delay, according to the law of the land.</P>
<P N="18">18. That the trial of facts where they arise, is one of the
<PB N="119" REF="017390_0119_0FA1113F87312408"/>
greatest securities of the lives, liberties, and estates of the people.</P>
<P N="19">19. That in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right to be informed of the accusation against him, to have a copy of the indictment or charge in due time (if required) to prepare for his defence, to be allowed counsel, to be con∣fronted with the witnesses against him, to have process for his witnesses, to examine the witnesses for and against him on oath, and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury, without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty.</P>
<P N="20">20. That no man ought to be compelled to give evidence against himself in a common court of law, or in any other court, but in such cases as have been usually practised in this state, or may hereafter be directed by the legislature.</P>
<P N="21">21. That no freeman ought to be taken or imprisoned, or disseised of his freehold, liberties, or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land.</P>
<P N="22">22. That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishments inflicted by the courts of law.</P>
<P N="23">23. That all warrants without oath or affirmation, to search suspected places, or to seize any person or property, are grievous and oppressive; and all general warrants to search suspected places, or to apprehend suspected persons, without naming or describing the place, or the person in spe∣cial, are illegal, and ought not to be granted.</P>
<P N="24">24. That there ought to be no forfeiture of any part of the estate of any person for any crime, except murder, or treason against the state, and then only on conviction and attainder.</P>
<P N="25">25. That a well regulated militia is the proper and natu∣ral defence of a free government.</P>
<P N="26">26. That standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be raised or kept up without consent of the legislature.</P>
<P N="27">27. That in all cases and at all times the military ought

<P>The other shall be called, <HI>The Senate,</HI> and consist of twenty-four members, of whom thirteen shall constitute a house to proceed on business, for whose election the different counties shall be divided into twenty-four districts, and each county of the respective district, at the time of the election of its delegates, shall vote for one senator, who is actually a resident and freeholder within the dis∣trict, or duly qualified according to law, and is upwards of twenty-five years of age; and the sheriffs of each coun∣ty, within five days at farthest, after the last county elec∣tion in the district, shall meet at some convenient place and from the poll so taken in their respective counties, re∣turn as a senator the man who shall have the greatest number of votes in the whole district.

The property of the soil in a free government being one of the essential rights of the collective body of the peo∣ple, it is necessary, in order to avoid future disputes, that the limits of the state should be ascertained with precision; and as the former temporary line between North and South Carolina was confirmed and extended by commissioners, ap∣pointed by the legislatures of the two states, agreeable to the order of the late king George II. in council, that line, and that only, should be esteemed the southern boundary of this state, that is to say, beginning on the sea side at a cedar stake, at or near the mouth of little river (being the southern ex∣tremity of Brunswic county), and running from thence a north-west course through the boundary house, which stands in thirty three degrees fifty six minutes, to thirty five degrees north latitude, and from thence a west course, so far as is mentioned in the charter of king Charles II. to the late pro∣prietors of Carolina: Therefore all the territory, seas, wa∣ters, and harbours, with their appurtenance, lying be∣tween

the line above described, and the southern line of the state of Virginia, which begins on the sea shore, in thirty six degrees thirty minutes north latitude, and from thence runs west, agreeable to the said charter of king Charles, are the right and property of the people of this state, to be held by them in sovereignty; any partial line, without the consent of the legislature of this state, at any time thereafter direct∣ed, or laid out in anywise notwithstanding. <HI>Provided al∣ways,</HI> That this declaration of right shall not prejudice any nation or nations of indians, from enjoying such hunting grounds as may have been, or hereafter shall be secured to them, by any former or future legislature of this state. <HI>And provided also,</HI> That it shall not be construed so as to prevent the establishment of one or more governments westward of this state, by consent of the legislature. <HI>And provided further,</HI> That nothing herein contained shall affect the titles or pos∣sessions of individuals, holding or claiming under the laws heretofore in force, or grants heretofore made by the late king George III. or his predecessors, or the late lords pro∣prietors, or any of them.</P>

<HEAD>The CONSTITUTION or FORM of GOVERN∣MENT, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS allegiance and protection are in their na∣ture reciprocal, and the one should of right he re∣fused when the other is withdrawn; and whereas George the Third, king of Great-Britain, and late sovereign of the British American colonies, hath not only withdrawn from them his protection, but by an act of the British le∣gislature declared the inhabitants of these states out of the protection of the British crown, and all their property found upon the high seas, liable to be seized and confis∣cated to the uses mentioned in the said act; and the said George the Third has also sent fleets and armies to prose∣cute a cruel war against them, for the purpose of reduc∣ing the inhabitants of the said colonies to a state of abject slavery; in consequence whereof all government under

<P>WHEREAS the constitution or form of government agreed to and resolved upon by the freemen of this country, met in congress the 26th day of March, 1776, was temporary only, and suited to the situation of their pub∣lic affairs at that period, looking forward to an accomo∣dation with Great-Britain, an event then desired: And whereas the united colonies of America have been since constituted independent states, and the political connexion heretofore subsisting between them and Great Britain entirely dissolved, by the declaration of the honourable the continen∣tal congress, dated the 4th day of July 1776, for the ma∣ny great and weighty reasons therein particularly set forth; it therefore becomes absolutely necessary to frame a consti∣tution suitable to that great event: Be it therefore consti∣tuted and enacted, by his excellency Rawlins Lowndes, Esq. president and commander in chief in and over the state of South-Carolina, by the honourable the legislative council and general assembly, and by the authority of the same, That the following articles agreed upon by the freemen of this state, now met in general assembly, be deemed and held the constitution and form of government of the said state, unless altered by the legislative authority there∣of: which constitution or form of government shall im∣mediately take place and be of force from the passing of

<HEAD>GEORGIA. The <HI>CONSTITUTION</HI> of the State of <HI>Georgia,</HI> unanimously agreed to, in <HI>CONVENTION,</HI> the <HI>5</HI>th of Feb∣ruary, <HI>1777.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS the conduct of the legislature of Great-Britain for many years past, has been so oppressive on the people of America, that of late years, they have plainly declared, and asserted a right to raise taxes upon the people of America, and to make laws to bind them in all cases whatsoever, without their consent; which con∣duct being repugnant to the common rights of mankind, hath obliged the Americans, as freemen to oppose such oppressive measures, and to assert the rights and privileges they are intitled to, by the laws of nature and reason; and accordingly it hath been done by the general consent of all the people of the states of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts-Bay, Rhode-Island, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, the counties of Newcastle, Kent, and Sus∣sex on Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, given by their representa∣tives met together in general congress in the city of Phila∣delphia.</P>
<P>And whereas it hath been recommended by the said Con∣gress on the fifteenth of May last, to the respective assem∣blies and conventions of the united states, where no go∣vernment, sufficient to the exigencies of their affairs, hath been hitherto established, to adopt such government, as may, in the opinion of the representatives of the people,
<PB N="175" REF="017390_0175_0FA1117C22F4B718"/>
best conduce to the happiness and safety of their constitu∣ents in particular, and America in general.</P>
<P>And whereas the independence of the united states of America has been also declared, on the fourth day of July, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-six, by the said honourable congress, and all political connection between them and the crown of Great-Britain, is in consequence thereof dissolved.</P>
<P>We, therefore, the representatives of the people, from whom all power originates, and for whose benefit all go∣vernment is intended, by virtue of the power delegated to us, do ordain and declare, and it is hereby ordained and declared, that the following rules and regulations be adopted for the future government of this state.</P>
<P N="1">1. The legislative, executive, and judiciary departments shall be separate and distinct, so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the other.</P>
<P N="2">2. The legislature of this state shall be composed of the representatives of the people, as is herein after pointed out: And the representatives shall be elected yearly, and every year, on the first Tuesday in December; and the representatives so elected, shall meet the first Tuesday in January following, at Savannah, or any other place or places, where the house of assembly for the time being shall direct.</P>
<P>On the first day of the meeting of the representatives so chosen, they shall proceed to the choice of a governor, who shall be stiled, <HI>Honourable</HI>; and of an executive coun∣cil, by ballot out of their own body; <HI>viz.</HI> two from each county, except those counties which are not yet entitled to send ten members. One of each county shall always attend where the governor resides, by monthly rotation, unless the members of each county agree for a longer or shorter period; this is not intended to exclude either mem∣ber attending: The remaining number of representatives shall be called <HI>The House of Assembly</HI>; and the majority of the members of the said house shall have power to proceed on business.</P>
<P N="3">3. It shall be an unalterable rule, that the house of
<PB N="176" REF="017390_0176_0FA1117C45A8B330"/>
assembly shall expire, and be at an end yearly and every year, on the day preceding the day of election, mentioned in the foregoing rule.</P>
<P N="4">4. The representation shall be divided in the following manner: Ten members for each county, as is herein after directed, excepting the county of Liberty, which contains three parishes, and that shall be allowed fourteen.</P>

<HEAD><HI>IN</HI> CONGRESS, <HI>JULY 4, 1776. A DECLARATION</HI> By the <HI>Representatives</HI> of the <HI>UNITED STATES</HI> of <HI>AMERICA,</HI> in <HI>CONGRESS</HI> assembled.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them; a decent respect to the opinions of man∣kind requires that they should declare the causes which im∣pel them to the separation.</P>
<P>We hold these truths to be self evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, go∣vernments are instituted among men, deriving their just pow∣ers from the consent of the governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to insti∣tute new government, laying its foundation on such princi∣ples, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Pru∣dence, indeed, will dictate that governments long esta∣blished should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind
<PB N="188" REF="017390_0188_0FA1118A916E18E0"/>
are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when along train of abuses and usurpa∣tions, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the pa∣tient sufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of govern∣ment. The history of the present king of Great-Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in di∣rect object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a can∣did world.</P>
<P>He has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</P>
<P>He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operati∣on till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</P>
<P>He has refused to pass other laws for the accomodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right inesti∣mable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.</P>
<P>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their pub∣lic records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into com∣pliance with his measures.</P>
<P>He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</P>
<P>He has refused, for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise; the state remaining in the mean time exposed to all the danger of invasion from without, and convulsions within.</P>
<P>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of fo∣reigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migra∣tions
<PB N="189" REF="017390_0189_0FA1118B49746130"/>
hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriati∣ons of lands.</P>
<P>He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refus∣ing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.</P>
<P>He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.</P>
<P>He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hi∣ther swarms of officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.</P>
<P>He has kept among us in times of peace, standing armies, without the consent of our legislatures.</P>
<P>He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the civil power.</P>
<P>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdicti∣on foreign to our constitution, and un-acknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation.</P>
<P>For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:</P>
<P>For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on the inhabi∣tants of these states:</P>
<P>For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:</P>
<P>For imposing taxes on us without our consent:</P>
<P>For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury:</P>
<P>For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences:</P>
<P>For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neigh∣bouring province, establishing therein an arbitrary govern∣ment, and enlarging its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same ab∣solute rule into these colonies:</P>
<P>For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valu∣able laws, and altering fundamentally the forms of our go∣vernments:</P>
<P>For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring them∣selves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</P>
<P>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection, and waging war against us.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="017390_0190_0FA1118C13702E58"/>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.</P>
<P>He is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy, scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.</P>
<P>He has constrained our fellow citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall them∣selves by their hands.</P>
<P>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and con∣ditions.</P>
<P>In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may de∣fine a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.</P>
<P>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of at∣tempts made by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We hare reminded them of the cir∣stances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them, by the ties of our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.</P>
<P>We, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and decl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e,
<PB N="191" REF="017390_0191_0FA1118DD7372938"/>
That these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be FREE <HI>and</HI> INDEPENDENT STATES; That they are absolv∣ed from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all po∣litical connection between them and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and In∣dependent States, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm re∣liance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honour.</P>

<P>The united states in congress assembled shall also be the last resort on appeal in all disputes and differences now subsisting or that hereafter may arise between two or more states concerning boundary, jurisdiction, or any other cause whatever; which authority shall always be exercised in the manner following. Whenever the legislative or executive authority or lawful agent of any state in controversy with another, shall present a petition to congress, stating the matter in question, and praying for a hearing, notice there∣of shall be given by order of congress to the legislative or executive authority of the other state in controversy, and a day assigned for the appearance of the parties by their lawful agents, who shall then be directed to appoint by joint consent, commissioners or judges to constitute a court for hearing and determining the matter in question; but if they cannot agree, congress shall name three persons out of each of the united states, and from the list of such
<PB N="198" REF="017390_0198_0FA110F788413090"/>
persons each party shall alternately strike out one, the petitioners beginning, until the number shall be reduced to thirteen; and from that number not less than seven, nor more than nine names as congress shall direct, shall in the presence of congress be drawn out by lot; and the persons whose names shall be so drawn, or any five of them, shall be commissioners or judges, to hear and fi∣nally determine the controversy, so always as a major part of the judges, who shall hear the cause, shall agree in the determination: and if either party shall neglect to attend at the day appointed, without shewing reasons which con∣gress shall judge sufficient, or being present shall refuse to strike, the congress shall proceed to nominate three persons out of each state, and the secretary of congress shall strike in behalf of such party absent or refusing; and the judgment and sentence of the court to be appointed, in the manner before prescribed, shall be final and con∣clusive; and if any of the parties shall refuse to submit to the authority of such court, or to appear or defend their claim or cause, the court shall nevertheless proceed to pro∣nounce sentence, or judgment, which shall in like man∣ner be final and decisive; the judgment or sentence and other proceedings being in either case transmitted to con∣gress, and lodged among the acts of congress, for the se∣curity of the parties concerned: provided, that every commissioner, before he sits in judgment, shall take an oath, to be administered by one of the judges of the su∣preme or superior court of the state, where the cause shall be tried, "well and truly to hear and determine the mat∣ter in question, according to the best of his judgment, without favour, affection, or hope of reward:" provided also, that no state shall be deprived of territory, for the benefit of the united states.</P>
<P>All controversies concerning the private right of soil claimed under different grants of two or more states, whose jurisdictions as they may respect such lands, and the states which passed such grants are adjusted, the said grants or either of them being at the same time claimed to have originated antecedent to such settlement of jurisdiction,
<PB N="199" REF="017390_0199_0FA110F84A351920"/>

<P>The united states in congress assembled shall have au∣thority to appoint a committee, to sit in the recess of congress, to be denominated, <HI>A Committee of the States,</HI> and to consist of one delegate from each state; and to appoint such other committees and civil officers as may be necessary for managing the general affairs of the united states under their direction; to appoint one of their number to preside, provided that no person be al∣lowed to serve in the office of president more than one year in any term of three years; to ascertain the necessa∣ry sums of money to be raised for the service of the unit∣ed states, and to appropriate and apply the same for de∣fraying the public expences; to borrow money or emit bills on the credit of the united states, transmitting every half year to the respective states an account of the sums of
<PB N="200" REF="017390_0200_0FA110F90AA29090"/>
money so borrowed or emitted; to build and equip a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avy; to agree upon the number of land forces, and to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣quisitions from each state for its quota, in proportion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> number of white inhabitants in such state, which requis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n shall be binding, and thereupon the legislature of each state shall appoint the regimental officers, raise the men, and cloath, arm, and equip them in a soldier like manner, at the expence of the united states, and the officers and men so cloathed, armed, and equipped, shall march to the place ap∣pointed, and within the time agreed on by the united states in congress assembled: but if the united states in congress assembled shall, on consideration of circumstances, judge proper that any state should not raise men, or should raise a smaller number than its quota, and that any other state should raise a greater number of men than the quota thereof, such extra number shall be raised, officered, cloathed, armed, and equipped in the same manner as the quota of such state, un∣less the legislature of such state shall judge that such extra number cannot be safely spared out of the same, in which case they shall raise, officer, cloath, arm, and equip, as many of such extra number as they judge can be safely spar∣ed. And the officers and men so cloathed, armed, and e∣quipped, shall march to the place appointed, and within the time agreed on by the united state in congress assembled.</P>
<P>The united states in congress assembled shall never engage in a war, nor grant letters of marque and reprisal, in time of peace, nor enter into any treaties or alliances, nor coin money, nor regulate the value thereof, nor ascertain the sums and expences necessary for the defence and welfare of the united states, or any of them, nor emit bills, nor bor∣row money on the credit of the united states, nor appro∣priate money, nor agree upon the number of vessels of war, to be built or purchased, or the number of land or sea for∣ces to be raised, nor appoint a commander in chief of the army or navy, unless nine states assent to the same: Nor shall a question on any other point, except for adjourning from day to day, be determined, unless by the votes of a majority of the united states in congress assembled.</P>

<P><HI>Art.</HI> 10. The committee of the states, or any nine of them, shall be authorised to execute, in the recess of con∣gress, such of the powers of congress as the united states in congress assembled, by the consent of nine states, shall from time to time think expedient to vest them with; pro∣vided that no power be delegated to the said committee, for the exercise of which, by the articles of confederation, the voice of nine states, in the congress of the united states as∣sembled, is requisite.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 11. Canada acceding to this confederation, and joining in the measures of the united states, shall be admit∣ted into, and entitled to all the advantages of this union: But no other colony shall be admited into the same, unless such admission be agreed to by nine states.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 12. All bills of credit emitted, monies borrowed and debts contracted by, or under the authority of congress, before the assembling of the united states, in pursuance of the present confederation, shall be deemed and considered as a charge against the united states, for payment and satis∣faction whereof the said united states, and the public faith are hereby solemnly pledged.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 13. Every state shall abide by the determinations of the united states, in congress assembled, on all questions which by this confederation are submitted to them.

<PB N="202" REF="017390_0202_0FA110FA993435A0"/>
any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a congress of the united states, and be afterwards confirmed by the legis∣latures of every state.</P>
<P>AND WHEREAS it hath pleased the great Governor of the world to incline the hearts of the legislatures we respectively represent in congress, to approve of, and to authorise us to ratify the said articles of confederation and perpetual union. KNOW YE, that we, the under∣signed delegates, by virtue of the power and authority to us given for that purpose, do, by these presents, in the name and in behalf of our respective constituents, fully and entirely ratify and confirm each and every of the said articles of confederation and perpetual union, and all and singular the matters and things therein contain∣ed.

<P>THE Most Christian King, and the Thirteen United States of North-America, <HI>to wit,</HI> New-Hampshire, Massachusetts-Bay, Rhode-Island, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, willing to fix in an equitable and permanent manner, the rules which ought to be followed relative to the correspondence and commerce which the two parties desire to establish between their respective countries, states, and subjects; his most christian majesty and the said united states have judged that the said end could not be better obtained, than by taking for the basis of their agreement, the most perfect equality and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eciprocity, and by carefully avoiding all those bur∣th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsome preferences which are usually sources of debate, embarrassment and discontent; by leaving also each party at liberty to make respecting navigation and commerce, those interior regulations which it shall find most conve∣nient to itself, and by founding the advantage of commerce solely upon reciprocal utility, and the just rules of free in∣tercourse; reserving withal to each party the liberty of ad∣mitting, at its pleasure, other nations to a participation of the same advantages. It is in the spirit of this intention, and to fulfil these views, that his said majesty having nam∣ed and appointed for his plenipotentiary, <HI>Conrad Alex∣ander Gerard,</HI> royal syndic of the city of Strasbourg, secre∣tary of his majesty's council of state; and the united states on their part, having fully empowered <HI>Benjamin Franklin,</HI> deputy from the state of Pennsylvania to the general con∣gress, and president to the convention of the said state; <HI>Silas Deane,</HI> late deputy from the state of Connecticut to the said congress, and <HI>Arthur Lee,</HI> counsellor at law: The said respective plenipotentiaries, after exchanging their powers, and after mature deliberation, have concluded and agreed upon the following articles.</P>

<P><HI>Art.</HI> 10. The united states, their citizens and inhabitants, shall never disturb the subjects of the most christian king in the enjoyment and exercise of the right of fishing on the banks of Newfoundland, nor in the indefinite and exclusive right which belongs to them on that part of the coast of that is∣land which is designed by the treaty of Utrecht, nor in the right relative to all and each of the isles which belong to his most christian majesty, the whole conformable to the true sense of the treaties of Utrecht and Paris.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 11. The subjects and inhabitants of the said united
<PB N="211" REF="017390_0211_0FA11106319B1CA8"/>
states, or any one of them, shall not be reputed <HI>Aubains</HI> in France, and consequently shall be exempted from the <HI>Droit d' Aubaine,</HI> or other similar duty, under what name soever; they may by testament, donation, or otherwise, dispose of their goods, moveable and immoveable, in fa∣vour of such persons as to them shall seem good, and their heirs, subjects of the united states, residing whether in France or elsewhere, may succeed them, <HI>ab intestat,</HI> with∣out being obliged to obtain letters of naturalization, and without having the effect of this concession contested or impeded, under pretext of any rights or prerogatives of provinces, cities, or private persons; and the said heirs, whether such by particular title, or <HI>ab intestat,</HI> shall be ex∣empt from all duty called <HI>Droit de detraction,</HI> or other duty of the same kind; saving nevertheless the local rights or duties, as much and as long as similar ones are not esta∣blished by the united states, or any of them. The subjects of the most christian king shall enjoy on their part, in all the dominions of the said states, an entire and perfect re∣ciprocity, relative to the stipulations contained in the pre∣sent article: But it is at the same time agreed, that its contents shall not effect the laws made, or that may be made hereafter in France, against emigrations, which shall remain in all their force and vigour; and the united states, on their part, or any of them, shall be at liberty to enact such laws, relative to that matter, as to them shall seem proper.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 12. The merchant ships of either of the parties, which shall be making into a port belonging to the enemy of the other ally, and concerning whole voyage and the species of goods on board her, there shall be just grounds of suspicion, shall be obliged to exhibit, as well upon the high seas, as in the ports and havens, not only her pass∣ports, but likewise certificates, expresly shewing that her goods are not of the number of those which have been prohibited as contraband.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 13. If, by exhibiting of the above-said certificates, the other party discover there are any of those sorts of goods which are prohibited and declared contraband, and con∣signed
<PB N="212" REF="017390_0212_0FA11108B3576EC0"/>
for a port under the obedience of his enemy, it shall not be lawful to break up the hatches of such ship, or to open any chest, coffers, parks, casks, or any other vessels found therein, or to remove the smallest parcels of her goods, whether such ship belongs to the subjects of France, or the inhabitants of the said united states, unless the lading be brought on shore, in the presence of the of∣ficers of the court of admiralty, and an inventory thereof made; but there shall be no allowance to sell, exchange, or alienate the same in any manner, until that after due and lawful process shall have been had against such prohibited goods, and the court of admiralty shall, by a sentence pronounced, have confiscated the same, saving always as well the ship itself, as any other goods found therein, which by this treaty are to be esteem∣ed free, neither may they be detained on pretence of their being as it were infected by the prohibited goods, much less shall they be confiscated as lawful prize; but if not the whole cargo, but only part thereof shall consist of prohibited or contraband goods, and the commander of the ship shall be ready and willing to deliver them to the captor who has discovered them, in such case the captor having received those goods, shall forthwith discharge the ship, and not hinder her by any means freely to prosecute the voyage on which she was bound. But in case the contraband merchandizes cannot be all received on board the vessel of the captor, then the captor may, notwith∣standing the offer of delivering him the contraband goods, carry the vessel into the nearest port, agreeable to what is above directed.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 14. On the contrary it is agreed, that whatever shall be found to be laden by the subjects and inhabitants of either party on any ship belonging to the enemies of the other, or to their subjects, the whole, although it be not of the sort of prohibited goods, may be confiscated in the same manner as if it belonged to the enemy, except such goods and merchandize as were put on board such ship before the declaration of war, or even after such declara∣tion, if so be it were done without knowledge of such de∣claration;
<PB N="213" REF="017390_0213_0FA11108C6BC49F8"/>
so that the goods of the subjects and people of either party, whether they be of the nature of such as are prohibited or otherwise, which, as is aforesaid, were put on board any ship belonging to an enemy before the war, or after the declaration of the same, without the knowledge of it, shall no ways be liable to confiscation, but shall well and truly be restored without delay to the proprietors de∣manding the same; but so as that if the said merchandizes be contraband, it shall not be any ways lawful to carry them afterwards to any ports belonging to the enemy. The two contracting parties agree, that the term of two months being passed after the declaration of war, their respective subjects, from whatever part of the world they come, shall not plead the ignorance mentioned in this article.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 15. And that more effectual care may be taken for the security of the subjects and inhabitants of both parties, that they suffer no injury by the men of war or privateers of the other party, all the commanders of the ships of his most christian majesty and of the said united states, and all their subjects and inhabitants, shall be forbid doing any injury or damage to the other side; and if they act to the contrary they shall be punished, and shall moreover be bound to make satisfaction for all matter of damage, and the interest there∣of, by reparation, under the pain and obligation of their persons and goods.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 16. All ships and merchandize of what nature soever, which shall be rescued out of the hands of any pirates or robbers on the high seas, shall be brought into some port of either state, and shall be delivered to the custody of the of∣ficers of that port, in order to be restored intire to the true proprietor, as soon as due and sufficient proof shall be made concerning the property thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 17. It shall be lawful for the ships of war of either party, and privateers, freely to carry whithersoever they please, the ships and goods taken from their enemies, with∣out being obliged to pay any duty to the officers of the ad∣miralty, or any other judges; nor shall such prizes be ar∣rested or seized when they come to and enter the port of either party; nor shall the searchers or other officers of those
<PB N="214" REF="017390_0214_0FA111098712DE08"/>
places search the same, or make examination concerning the lawfulness of such prizes; but they may hoist sail at any time, and depart and carry their prizes to the places ex∣pressed in their commissions, which the commanders of such ships of war shall be obliged to shew: On the contrary, no shelter or refuge shall be given in their ports to such as shall have made prize of the subjects, people, or property of either of the parties; but if such shall come in, being forced by stress of weather, or the danger of the sea, all proper means shall be vigorously used, that they go out and retire from thence as soon as possible.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 18. If any ship belonging to either of the parties, their people, or subjects, shall within the coasts or domini∣ons of the other, stick upon the sands, or be wrecked or suffer any other damage, all friendly assistance and relief shall be given to the persons shipwrecked, or such as shall be in danger thereof. And letters of safe conduct shall likewise be given to them for their free and quiet passage from thence, and the return of every one to his own country.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 19. In case the subjects and inhabitants of either par∣ty, with their shipping, whether public and of war, or pri∣vate and of merchants, be forced through stress of weather, pursuit of pirates or enemies, or any other urgent necessity, for seeking of shelter and harbour, to retreat and enter into any of the rivers, bays, roads, or ports belonging to the other party, they shall be received and treated with all hu∣manity and kindness, and enjoy all friendly protection and help; and they shall be permitted to refresh and provide themselves at reasonable rates with victuals, and all things needful for the sustenance of their persons, or reparation of their ships, and conveniency of their voyage, and they shall no ways be detained or hindered from returning out of the said ports or roads, but may remove and depart when and whither they please, without any let or hindrance.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 20. For the better promoting of commerce on both sides, it is agreed, that if a war should break out between the said two nations, six months after the proclamation of war shall be allowed to the merchants in the cities and towns where they live, for selling and transporting their goods and
<PB N="215" REF="017390_0215_0FA1110A48DB0F30" MS="y"/>
merchandizes; and if any thing be taken from them, or any injury be done them within that term, by either party, or the people or subjects of either, full satisfaction shall be made for the same.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 21. No subject of the most christian king shall apply for or take any commission or letters of marque for arming any ship or ships to act as privateers against the said united states or any of them, or against the subjects, people, or in∣habitants of the said united states or any of them, or against the property of any of the inhabitants of any of them from any prince or state with which the united states shall be at war; nor shall any citizen, subject, or inhabitant of the said unit∣ed states or any of them, apply for or take any commission or letters of marque for arming any ship or ships to act as privateers against the subjects of the most christian king, or any of them, or the property of any of them, from any prince or state with which the said king shall be at war; and if any person of either nation shall take such commission or letters of marque, he shall be punished as a pirate.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 22. It shall not be lawful for any foreign privateers, not belonging to the subjects of the most christian king, nor citizens of the said united states, who have commissions from any other prince or state, at enmity with either nation, to fit their ships in the ports of either the one or the other of the aforesaid parties, to sell what they have taken, or in any other manner whatsoever to exchange their ships, mer∣chandizes or any other lading; neither shall they be allowed even to purchase victuals, except such as shall be necessary for their going to the next port of that prince or state from which they have commissions.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 23. It shall be lawful for all and singular the subjects of the most christian king, and the citizens, people and inha∣bitants of the said united states, to sail with their ships with all manner of liberty and security, no distinction being made who are the proprietors of the merchandize laden thereon, from any port to the places of those who now are or here∣after shall be at enmity with the most christian king or the united states. It shall likewise be lawful for the subjects and inhabitants aforesaid, to sail with the ships and merchandizes aforementioned, and to trade with the same liberty and se∣curity

from the places, ports and havens of those who are enemies of both or either party, without any opposition or disturbance whatsoever, not only directly from the places of the enemy aforementioned to neutral places, but also from one place belonging to an enemy to another place be∣longing to an enemy, whether they be under the jurisdicti∣on of the same prince, or under several. And it is hereby stipulated, that free ships shall also give a freedom to goods, and that every thing shall be deemed free and exempt which shall be found on board the ships belonging to the subjects of either of the confederates, although the whole lading or any part thereof should appertain to the enemies of either, con∣traband goods being always excepted. It is also agreed in like manner, that the same liberty be extended to persons who are on board a free ship, with this effect, that although they be enemies to both or either party, they are not to be taken out of that free ship, unless they are soldiers and in actual service of the enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 24.

<P><HI>Art.</HI> 25. To the end that all manner of dissentions and quarrels may be avoided and prevented, on one side and the other, it is agreed, that in case either of the parties hereto, should be engaged in war, the ships and vessels belonging to the subjects or people of the other ally must be furnished with sea letters or passports, expressing the name, proper∣ty and bulk of the ship, as also the name and place of ha∣bitation of the master or commander of the said ship, that it may appear thereby that the ship really and truly belongs to the subjects of one of the parties, which passport shall be made out and granted according to the form annexed to this treaty; they shall likewise be recalled every year, that is, if the ship happens to return home within the space of a year; it is likewise agreed, that such ships being laden are to be pro∣vided not only with passports as above mentioned, but also with certificates, containing the several particulars of the cargo, the place whence the ship sailed, and whether she is bound, that so it may be known whether any forbidden or contraband goods be on board of the same, which certificates shall be made out by the officers of the place whence the
<PB N="218" REF="017390_0218_0FA1110C85D9E4F0"/>
ship set sail, in the accustomed form; and if any one shall think it fit or adviseable to express in the said certificates, the person to whom the goods on board belong, he many free∣ly do so.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 26. The ships of the subjects and inhabitants of ei∣ther of the parties coming upon any coast belong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g to either of the said allies, but not willing to enter into port, or being entered into port and not willing to unload their cargoes or break bulk, they shall be treated according to the general rules prescribed or to be prescribed relative to the object in question.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 27. If the ships of the said subjects, people or inha∣bitants of either of the parties shall be met with, either sail∣ing along the coasts or on the high seas, by any ship of war of the other, or by any privateers, the said ships of war or privateers, for the avoiding of any disorder, shall remain out of cannon shot, and may send their boats on board the mer∣chant ship which they shall so meet with, and may enter her to the num<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er of two or three men only, to whom the master or commander of such ship or vessel shall exhibit his passport concerning the property of the ship, made out ac∣cording to the form inserted in this present treaty, and the ship, when she shall have shewed such passport, shall be free and at liberty to pursue her voyage, so as it shall not be law∣ful to molest or search in any manner, or to give her chase or to force her to quit her intended course.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>TREATY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Most Christian King and the United States of North-America, <HI>to wit.</HI> New-Hampshire, Massa∣chusetts-Bay, Rhode-Island, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virgi∣nia, North-Carolina and Georgia, having this day con∣cluded a Treaty of Amity and Commerce, for the recipro∣cal advantage of their subjects and citizens, have thought it necessary to take into consideration the means of strength∣ening those engagements, and of rendering them useful to the safety and tranquillity of the two parties; particularly in case Great-Britain, in resentment of that connection, and of the good correspondence which is the object of the said treaty, should break the peace with France, either by direct hostilities, or by hindering her commerce and na∣vigation in a manner contrary to the rights of nations, and the peace subsisting between the two crowns. And his majesty and the said united states having resolved in that case, to join their councils and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Forts against the enter∣prizes of their common enemy.</P>
<P>The respective plenipotentiaries impowered to concert the clauses and conditions proper to fulfil the said intenti∣ons, have, after the most mature deliberation, concluded and determined on the following articles.</P>
<P><HI>Article</HI> 1. IF war should break out between France and Great-Britain, during the continuance of the present war between the united states and England, his majesty and the said united states shall make it a common cause, and aid each other mutually with their good offices, their coun∣sels and their forces, according to the exigence of con∣junctures, as becomes good and faithful allies.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="017390_0224_0FA11111F2CC49A8"/><HI>Art.</HI> 2. The essential and direct end of the present de∣fensive alliance is, to maintain effectually the liberty, so∣vereignty, and independence absolute and unlimited, of the said united states, as well in matters of government as of commerce.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 3. The two contracting parties shall, each on its own part, and in the manner it may judge most proper, make all the efforts in it's power against their common enemy, in order to attain the end proposed.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 4. The contracting parties agree, that in case either of them should form any particular enterprize in which the concurrence of the other may be desired, the party whose concurrence is desired, shall readily and with good faith join to act in concert for that purpose, as far as circum∣stances and its own particular situation will permit, and in that case, they shall regulate by a particular conventi∣on, the quantity and kind of succour to be furnished, and the time and manner of its being brought into action, as well as the advantages which are to be its compensation.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 5. If the united states should think fit to attempt the reduction of the British power, remaining in the northern parts of America, or the islands of Bermudas, those countries or islands, in case of success, shall be con∣sederated with, or dependent upon the said united states.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 6. The most christian king renounces forever the possession of the islands of Bermudas, as well as of any part of the continent of North-America, which before the treaty of Paris, in 1763, or in virtue of that treaty, were acknowledged to belong to the crown of Great-Britain, or to the united states, heretofore called British colonies, or which are at this time, or have lately been under the power of the king and crown of Great-Britain.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 7. If his most christian majesty shall think proper to attack any of the islands situated in the Gulph of Mex∣ico, or near that gulph, which are at present under the power of Great Britain, all the said isles, in case of suc∣cess, shall appertain to the crown of France.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 8. Neither of the two parties shall conclude either truce or peace with Great-Britain, without the formal
<PB N="225" REF="017390_0225_0FA111128E2B6160"/>
consent of the other first obtained; and they mutually en∣gage not to lay down their arms, until the independence of the united states shall have been formally or tacitly as∣sured, by the treaty or treaties that shall terminate the war.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 9. The contracting parties declare, that being re∣solved to fulfil each on it's own part, the clauses and con∣ditions of the present treaty of alliance, according to its own power and circumstances, there shall be no after-claim of compensation, on one side or the other, whatever may be the event of the war.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 10. The most christian king and the united states agree, to invite or admit other powers, who may have received injuries from England, to make common cause with them, and to accede to the present alliance, under such conditions as shall be freely agreed to, and settled between all the parties.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 11. The two parties guarantee mutually from the present time and forever, against all other powers, <HI>to wit.</HI> The united states to his most christian majesty, the present possessions of the crown of France in America, as well as those which it may acquire by the future treaty of peace; and his most christian majesty guarantees on his part to the united states, their liberty, sovereignty, and indepen∣dence, absolute and unlimited, as well in matters of go∣vernment as commerce, and also their possessions, and the additions or conquests, that their confederation may ob∣tain during the war, from any of the dominions now, or heretofore possessed by Great-Britain in North-America; conformable to the fifth and sixth articles above written, the whole as their possession shall be fixed and assured to the said states, at the moment of the cessation of their pre∣sent war with England.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 12. In order to fix more precisely the sense and ap∣plication of the preceding article, the contracting parties declare, that in case of a rupture between France and England, the reciprocal guarantee declared in the said ar∣ticle, shall have its full force and effect, the moment such war shall break out; and if such rupture shall not take
<PB N="226" REF="017390_0226_0FA111134624DC58"/>
place, the mutual obligations of the said guarantee shall not commence until the moment of the cessation of the present war, between the united states and England, shall have as∣certained their possessions.</P>
<P><HI>Art.</HI> 13. The present treaty shall be ratified on both sides, and the ratifications shall be exchanged in the space of six months, or sooner, if possible.</P>
