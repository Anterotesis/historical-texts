<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>I. TIM. iv. 16.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Take heed unto thy self, and unto thy Doctrine; and continue in them: For in doing this, thou shalt save both thy self, and them that hear thee.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THEY are the Words of PAUL to TIMOTHY, <HI>his own Son in the Faith:</HI> And they are di∣rected to him, not in his <HI>private</HI> Capacity as a <HI>Christian,</HI> but an <HI>Officer</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of GOD; one whom JESUS CHRIST the LORD <HI>had counted faithful, putting him into the Ministry.</HI> And they were, no doubt, intended for the Instruction and Admonition of all others, in all after Ages, to whose <HI>Trust, the glorious Gospel of the blessed GOD, should be committed.</HI></P>
<P>And two Things are observable in them.</P>
<P>I. A <HI>summary Representation of the Duty of Ministers. Take heed unto thy self, and unto thy Doctrine; continue in them.</HI></P>
<P>II. A <HI>special Motive</HI> inforcing the Duty. <HI>For in doing this, thou shalt save both thy self, and them that hear thee.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005358_0004_10182233A4AFC8E0"/>
Accordingly, these are the <HI>general Heads</HI> we shall distinctly speak to, and then finish with an <HI>Application</HI> proper to the Business of the Day.</P>
<P>I. The first Thing to employ our Thoughts from the Text is, the <HI>Description</HI> it gives of the <HI>Duty</HI> of <HI>Mi∣nisters;</HI> summarily comprehending the three following Particulars. (1.) Their <HI>taking heed to themselves.</HI> (2.) To their <HI>Doctrine.</HI> (3.) Their <HI>continuing in these Things.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>first</HI> Article in the <HI>Duty</HI> of <HI>Ministers</HI> is, their <HI>taking heed to themselves,</HI> i. e. their <HI>Minds,</HI> that they be furnish'd, both with <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Gifts;</HI> and their <HI>Behaviour,</HI> that it be befitting those, who are cloathed with the <HI>sacred Office.</HI> Here it may be distinctly said,</P>
<P N="1">1. If <HI>Ministers</HI> would <HI>take heed to themselves,</HI> they must look to their <HI>Minds,</HI> that they be furnish'd both with <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Gifts.</HI></P>
<P>They must express a sutable Care, that their <HI>Minds</HI> be furnish'd with <HI>Grace.</HI> Or, in other Words, they must see to it that they be <HI>inwardly</HI> Men of <HI>Religion; Partakers of the Divine Nature;</HI> Subjects of <HI>Faith</HI> in JESUS CHRIST, that Faith which shall <HI>purify their Hearts, purge their Con∣sciences from dead Works,</HI> &amp; dispose them to an <HI>Acquies∣cence</HI> in the <HI>Gospel</HI> Method of Salvation: Nor can they otherwise be in Favour with GOD here, or have Admis∣sion into his Kingdom hereafter. For the Way to hea∣ven is <HI>one.</HI> 'Tis the same both for Ministers and People. 'Tis not meerly our being Preachers to others, that will avail to our Salvation. We must be <HI>Men in CHRIST,</HI> justified in his Righteousness, and sanctified by his SPI∣RIT; or nothing will prevent our being doom'd, at the great and last Day, to a Departure from CHRIST among the Workers of Iniquity. Our first and chief Care there∣fore should be, to experience in our own Hearts the Truths we preach to others; to be <HI>ourselves</HI> the <HI>regene∣rate</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="005358_0005_101822354F3762C0"/>
Men, the <HI>new Creatures,</HI> the <HI>sound Believers,</HI> we urge others to be: Nor would any Thing more happily tend to render our Ministry serviceable to the great and good Ends of our being intrusted with it.</P>
<P>Though I would not be understood by this to suggest, as if Ministers <HI>must</HI> be endowed with <HI>saving Grace,</HI> or no good Effect would follow upon their Administrations in CHRIST'S Name. I know, the <HI>Instrumentality</HI> of <HI>uncon∣verted</HI> Ministers, in the Business of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> has, in these Days, been compared to <HI>that</HI> of a <HI>naturally dead Man in begetting Children.</HI> But this Way of represent∣ing the Matter is evidently founded on gross Ignorance of the unavoidable State of the <HI>visible Kingdom of GOD.</HI> There is no such Thing as <HI>certainly</HI> securing the Church of CHRIST from the Ministrations of Men, not knowing the Grace of GOD in Truth. Neither <HI>People</HI> who call Men to the Work of the Ministry, nor <HI>Ministers</HI> who separate them to it, can look into their Hearts: Nor can they, either of them, make a Judgment of their <HI>State</HI> by any Thing but what is <HI>outward</HI> and <HI>visible.</HI> And notwith∣standing the most specious <HI>outward</HI> Appearance, whether in Word or Deed, their Hearts may be leaven'd with <HI>Hypocrisy:</HI> Nor can it be <HI>known</HI> of any Minister, on the Earth, that he is the Man <HI>inwardly,</HI> he professes to be <HI>outwardly.</HI> I speak not this to insinuate a Suspicion of Ministers, as tho' they were <HI>Hypocrites.</HI> GOD forbid I should be an Encourager of such <HI>Uncharitableness,</HI> or, in this Way, lead any into an ill Opinion of them, to the Hurt of their Reputation and Usefulness! But what I aim at is to show, that there is no knowing the <HI>inward real</HI> State of <HI>Ministers</HI> any more than People; and that, after the closest Adherence to <HI>Scripture-rule</HI> in judging of them, we may be deceived, taking them for <HI>converted</HI> when they are not. And can it be supposed, that <HI>sanc∣tifying Grace</HI> should be <HI>necessary</HI> to a <HI>regular</HI> or <HI>valid</HI> Ad∣ministration of Gospel-Ordinances, when 'tis the <HI>sole Prerogative</HI> of the great GOD, to <HI>know</HI> the Persons that
<PB N="8" REF="005358_0006_10182237251ABFB0"/>
are endowed with it, and the <HI>appropriate</HI> Work of the SON of GOD, at the final Judgment, to declare who they are? Is it possible <HI>that</HI> should be <HI>essential</HI> to the <HI>Character</HI> or <HI>Success</HI> of Ministers, in regard of which there is no Church on Earth but may be imposed on? And if Gospel-Ordinances will be <HI>effectual</HI> to Salvation, <HI>only</HI> as administred by <HI>converted</HI> Ministers, whose Admi∣nistration of them must be attended on? And the Reso∣lution of this Question is the more necessary, because, for all any Thing that we know, or indeed can know, unless by <HI>immediate Revelation from GOD,</HI> the Ministers we most admire, and have the highest Opinion of, as eminent∣ly <HI>sanctified</HI> Men, may be no other than <HI>whited Sepul∣chres, beautiful without; but within, full of dead Men's Bones, and all Rottenness and Uncleanness.</HI></P>
<P>This confining the <HI>Success</HI> of Gospel-Ordinances to the <HI>inward unknown Sanctity</HI> of the Administrators is therefore unreasonable and antichristian; yea, pursued in its just Consequences, it will totally destroy the Use, both of <HI>Ordinances</HI> and <HI>Ministers</HI> to dispense them. And however some may be very fond of a Notion car∣rying in it so much seeming Piety, and zealous in pro∣pagating it to the Disturbance of the Churches, and fo∣menting Divisions in them, they herein depart, both from the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and the <HI>Principles</HI> of the famous <HI>Westminster Assembly of Divines,</HI> as well as the <HI>Faith</HI> of the <HI>Forefathers</HI> of this Country, one express Article in whose Confession, consented to by their <HI>Elders</HI> and <HI>Mes∣sengers,</HI> convened at <HI>Boston,</HI> May 12. 1660, is in these Words, <Q>The grace which is exhibited in or by the Sacraments, rightly used, is not conferred by any Power in them: Neither doth the <HI>efficacy</HI> of a Sa∣crament depend upon the <HI>Piety,</HI> or <HI>Intention</HI> of him that doth administer it: but upon the <HI>Work of the</HI> SPIRIT, and the <HI>Word of Institution,</HI> which contains, together with a Precept authorising the Use thereof, a <HI>Promise</HI> of <HI>Benefit</HI> to <HI>worthy</HI> Receivers.</Q> But to go on,</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005358_0007_1018223C58624F40"/>
<HI>Ministers</HI> should not only take Care that their Minds be furnish'd with Grace, but with <HI>Gifts</HI> also. It may reasonably be suppos'd, that their <HI>natural Gifts,</HI> their <HI>mental</HI> Capacities, are above the common level: O∣therwise, they certainly judged ill in desiring the Of∣fice of <HI>Overseers</HI> in the Church of GOD; and it was ill-judged in <HI>People</HI> to call them to the Work of the Ministry, and still more so in the Pastors of the Chur∣ches who separated them to it. But it is not enough that they are endow'd with good <HI>natural</HI> Powers. These must be well cultivated and enriched by <HI>Medita∣tion</HI> and <HI>Study.</HI> In this Way, under the Influence of the blessed SPIRIT, they should take Pains, that they may acquire all <HI>necessary Gifts</HI> for the Use of Edificati∣on; Gifts for <HI>praying,</HI> and <HI>preaching,</HI> and administring the <HI>Sacraments</HI> and <HI>Censures</HI> of the Kingdom of CHRIST: Nor should they content themselves meerly with an A∣bility to do these Duties of their Office; but endea∣vour after a Capacity and Readiness to perform them in an agreeable Manner, so as to engage the Attention, and command the Esteem and Veneration of their Hearers. Especially should Ministers take Care, that their <HI>preaching</HI> be such as may discover them to be Men of Knowledge and Understanding, and not Babes in Divine Things. It should appear from their Dis∣courses, that they are able to instruct the Ignorant, to resolve the Doubting, to convince the Gain-sayers, to awaken the Secure, to comfort the Broken-hearted; and, in a Word, that they have the Skill to adapt themselves to the Cases of all Sorts of Persons, and to the various Occurrences, in divine Providence, which may be capable of being improved to the spiritual Ad∣vantage of their People.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, may expect to be furnished with these Qualifications for the Work of the Ministry, in an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Way, without the diligent Use of <HI>com∣mon Means.</HI> But they herein miserably delude them∣selves. Even TIMOTHY was advised by the inspired
<PB N="10" REF="005358_0008_1018223DE5A14918"/>
PAUL, in my Context, <HI>not to neglect the Gift that was in him;</HI> but to make <HI>his profiting appear unto all, by giv∣ing Attendance to Reading and Meditation.</HI> And it is in this Way, together with the Use of <HI>Prayer,</HI> humbly depending on the Blessing of Heaven, and in this Way <HI>only,</HI> that we may warrantably hope to acquire those ministerial Accomplishments, which will be an Honor to our Profession, and render us eminently useful in the Places Divine Providence has fixed us. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Ministers,</HI> in taking heed to <HI>themselves,</HI> should look to their <HI>Behaviour</HI> that it be befitting those who are intrusted with the Care of Souls. In Order whereto,</P>
<P>To be sure, they must not be Men of <HI>bad Lives.</HI> A <HI>vicious</HI> Minister is one of the most misbecoming Creatures in all the World. A Teacher of others in all Godliness and Righteousness, and yet prophane, un∣clean, intemperate, unjust, uncharitable; what a Re∣proach is he to himself, and Scandal to the Profession? The Lives of such Ministers are a practical Contempt of Religion, whatever they may say in its Favour while they are <HI>preaching.</HI> The Ways of Piety, through their Means, are evil-spoken of, and the <HI>Son of GOD</HI> him∣self reproached and blasphemed. When others see the Preachers of Salvation living in those Practices that are unseemly in the Sight of GOD and Man, they are rea∣dy to esteem CHRIST <HI>a Minister of Sin,</HI> and to reflect upon <HI>his Religion</HI> as allowing, or, at least, not suffici∣ently discountenancing Vice and Wickedness: Nor does any Thing more dreadfully prejudice Men against a religious Profession, and harden them in their Sins.</P>
<P>But besides not being vicious, <HI>Ministers</HI> should be of <HI>a good Conversation in</HI> CHRIST. It is not enough that they keep themselves innocent from great Transgressi∣ons, that they are blameless, and without Rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse Generation; but they
<PB N="11" REF="005358_0009_10182241B22FD6E0"/>
must express a becoming Care to <HI>shew themselves Patterns of good Works; Examples</HI> to all they live among, <HI>in Word, in Conversation, in Faith, in Purity, in Charity.</HI> Such should be their Manner of Life as to be able to appeal to the People of their respective Charges, in the Language of the <HI>Apostles, Ye are Witnesses, and GOD also, how holily, and justly, and unblameably, we behaved ourselves among them that believe.</HI> This would exhibit a lovely Idea of Religion, and recommend it to the Choice and Esteem of the World, more than the best studied Sermons, while they saw we paid little Regard to them ourselves.</P>
<P>But there are some <HI>special</HI> Instances of <HI>Behaviour,</HI> peculiarly befitting Ministers, and wherein they must be <HI>exemplary,</HI> if they would take due heed to <HI>them∣selves.</HI> Thus,</P>
<P>They should behave with <HI>Humility;</HI> setting before their View, the Example of the meek and lowly JESUS, their Master and Lord; who condescended to wash e∣ven his Disciples Feet. They should not, because they have the Advantage of some others in Point of <HI>Educati∣ons, Gifts,</HI> and <HI>Station</HI> in the Church of GOD, grow big in their own Imagination, and treat those below them with Neglect and Contempt. Nothing appears more unseemly in those whose Business it is to <HI>preach up Hu∣mility,</HI> than the Discovery of a proud and haughty Spi∣rit, a Temper to <HI>lord it over GOD's Heritage,</HI> and to carry it with Loftiness, as though they might not be spoken to. But of all Pride in Ministers, none is so odious as that which is <HI>spiritual.</HI> They never appear more disagreeable, than while they are boasting of their own superior Sanctity, trusting in themselves that they are righteous, and despising others; especially is this Vanity detestable, when it shows itself in Contempt of their <HI>Brethren</HI> in the <HI>Ministry;</HI> when they are urged on by it to invade their Province, looking upon them∣selves as <HI>extraordinary</HI> Men, <HI>special</HI> instruments in the Con∣version
<PB N="12" REF="005358_0010_10182244852E5310"/>
of Sinners▪ while those, into whose Labours they enter, are esteemed and treated by them (tho' perhaps much more valuable than themselves in the Opinion of all sober Judges) as poor carnal worthless Creatures, not fit to preach the Gospel. How much better would it sute the Character of those who are the Ministers of the humble JESUS, if, with the great <HI>Apostle</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> they appeared to have an Opinion of themselves as <HI>less than the least of all Saints, and not meet to be called Ministers?</HI> If they preferred others in Love, esteemed them better than themselves, and treated them with a decent Respect? And they would shine still brighter, if, at all Times, they appear'd with an Air of Meek∣ness and Condescension, shewing <HI>Humility</HI> to <HI>all,</HI> in their Speech, in their Carriage, in all the Exercises of their Office. This modest humble Deportment is <HI>graceful</HI> in <HI>any,</HI> but peculiarly recommending in Men of <HI>our Pro∣fession.</HI> Scarce any Thing will raise us higher in the good Opinion of People; whereas, if we are lofty and proud, its much if we are reverenced by any but our selves.</P>
<P>Ministers should behave also with <HI>Charity;</HI> discover∣ing a Readiness to all the Offices of Christian Love and Kindness, both to Men's Souls and Bodies, their Character and Usefulness in the World: Nor should they confine these Exercises of their Good-will to their Friends and Acquaintance, those who may think well of them and admire them. This would be to do no more than <HI>Publicans</HI> and <HI>Sinners.</HI> For they <HI>love those that love them, salute their Brethren,</HI> and treat their Friends with singu∣lar Marks of Civility and Courtesie. And shall <HI>Christian Ministers</HI> carry the Expressions of their Charity no higher than this comes to? They ought to shew their Benig∣nity to Enemies, yea, the greatest Enemies they have in the World; those who most injure and abuse them. It should be visible to all they Converse with, that they can put up Affronts, bear Insults, forgive ill Treatment, yea, that they can <HI>do good to them that hate them,</HI> that
<PB N="13" REF="005358_0011_1018224616BB2EF0"/>
they can <HI>bless them that curse them,</HI> and <HI>pray for them that despitefully use and persecute them.</HI></P>
<P>And if they should exercise Charity in such high In∣stances, much more should they behave with Kindness to those, who are no otherwise Enemies to them, than as they cannot think and speak just as they would have them. They should not <HI>judge</HI> such; they should not <HI>set at nought</HI> such; for one is <HI>our Master in Heaven,</HI> and we <HI>must all appear before the Judgment-seat of</HI> CHRIST. They should not treat such with <HI>Bitterness,</HI> and <HI>Wrath,</HI> and <HI>Anger,</HI> and <HI>Clamour,</HI> and <HI>Evil-speaking.</HI> This is not the <HI>Charity,</HI> any more than the Wisdom, <HI>that is from above.</HI> The Charity of this Kind is <HI>peaceable, gentle, easy to be intreated, full of Mercy, and good Fruits, and without Partiality.</HI> It looks ill, especially in <HI>Ministers,</HI> to call bad Names, to sit in Judgment upon their Fel∣low-Christians, and <HI>Fellow-Labourers</HI> in the Work of the Lord, to determine their State, and damn their Souls. It would be much more becoming, should they be <HI>Op∣posers of the Truth, and taken in the Snare of the Devil, to instruct them in Meekness.</HI> This might, through the Blessing of GOD, bring them <HI>to Repentance, to the ac∣knowledging of the Truth:</HI> But to <HI>rail</HI> at them will have no Tendency to enlighten their Minds, or alter their Judgments; though it may move their Resentments, and fill them with Indignation.</P>
<P>In like Manner, Ministers should behave with <HI>Steadi∣ness;</HI> making it apparent, that they are of <HI>fixt</HI> Princi∣ples, and a <HI>uniform</HI> Conduct. They should not be <HI>like Children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrine:</HI> Neither should they be like those <HI>fluctuating, volatile, uncertain</HI> Men, who are <HI>easily turn∣ed aside from the Truth, by the cunning Craftiness of those who lie in wait to deceive.</HI> To be sure, they should not vary and change, be of this Party or that, appear in this Shape or the other, as may best sute the sinful Design of <HI>pleasing Man:</HI> But they should be Men of Steadiness,
<PB N="14" REF="005358_0012_10182248AEDFD508"/>
consistent with themselves, altering neither their <HI>Senti∣ments,</HI> nor <HI>Profession,</HI> nor <HI>Conduct,</HI> that they may fall in-with the Example of the <HI>Populace,</HI> the <HI>Humour</HI> of some <HI>particular Persons,</HI> or the <HI>Revolution of Affairs,</HI> whether in <HI>Church</HI> or <HI>State.</HI> Ministers, above all Men, should be <HI>stedfast and immoveable.</HI> I do not mean, that they should be <HI>unreasonably</HI> so. There is a <HI>Tenaciousness,</HI> both of <HI>Opinion</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> arising from <HI>Pride, Ignorance, Prejudice, Heat</HI> and <HI>Strength of Imagination:</HI> And the Men are to be pitied, rather than commended, who are thus <HI>stiff:</HI> They are rather <HI>blindly obstinate,</HI> than <HI>ratio∣nally stedfast.</HI> The <HI>Stedfastness</HI> which would be a Glory to Ministers, is such an <HI>habitual Fixedness</HI> of Sentiment and <HI>Uniformity</HI> of Practice, as is the Result of Conside∣ration; and impartial, deliberate, thorow Inquiry into the Mind of GOD, made known in the Bible. And having, in this Way, settled their Principles, and satisfied them∣selves how they ought to act, they should not waver in their Minds, and be unstable in their Ways. That was the Advice PAUL gave TIMOTHY, in his 2d Epist. to him, Chap. 1. v. 13. <HI>Hold fast the Form of sound Words, which thou hast heard of me, in Faith and Love which is in</HI> CHRIST JESUS. And the more <HI>special Reason</HI> of this Ad∣vice is added in the 15 v. <HI>This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me.</HI> And the same Advice is seasonable at this Day, and too much so, for the like Reason. To be sure, there is Danger, lest <HI>Mi∣nisters</HI> should be <HI>turned away from the Apostles:</HI> And they should take heed to themselves, that they <HI>fall not from their Stedfastness,</HI> being <HI>led away with the Error of the Wicked.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, Ministers should behave with <HI>Courage</HI> and <HI>Resolution;</HI> not being asham'd, or afraid, to appear for GOD, and in Defence of his <HI>Truths</HI> and <HI>Ways.</HI> It would be mean in those who are commission'd Servants of JESUS CHRIST, to behold the Rise of Error, in Opposition to the Faith revealed by him; to behold the Growth of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Wickedness,</HI> in Contradiction to the Law of GOD
<PB N="15" REF="005358_0013_1018224ADD34F1A8"/>
made known in his Gospel; to behold the general Spread of <HI>Contention</HI> and <HI>Schism,</HI> in Violation of the <HI>Or∣der</HI> he has appointed: I say, it would be dastardly in Ministers to see these Things, and stand by, and keep Silence. They are <HI>set for the Defence of the Gospel;</HI> 'tis one special Part of the Work they are called to, <HI>by sound Doctrine, to exhort and convince Gain sayers.</HI> And <HI>now</HI> is the Time when they should stand up for the <HI>good old Way,</HI> and bear a faithful Testimony against every Thing that may cast a Blemish on <HI>true primitive Christianity.</HI> And if they <HI>now</HI> hold their Peace, they are too much un∣der the Influence of that <HI>Fear of Man, which bringeth a Snare;</HI> they are guilty of <HI>Cowardice</HI> which they can't give a good Account of, either to GOD, or their own <HI>Consciences.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, Ministers should behave with <HI>Activity</HI> and <HI>Di∣ligence. Idleness</HI> in a <HI>Minister</HI> is one of the worst Things that can be said of him, and should be most distant from his Character. <HI>Be an Example,</HI> says the <HI>Apostle</HI> to TI∣MOTHY, <HI>in Spirit,</HI> i. e. as some gloss upon it, "in a sprightly Zeal and Activity for the Glory of GOD, and the Good of Souls." We have a great deal of Work to do, as we are called to watch for the Souls of others, as well as our own; a great deal to do, not only in our <HI>Closets</HI> and <HI>Studies,</HI> but in our <HI>private Applications,</HI> espe∣cially to the <HI>Sick,</HI> those that are <HI>gone astray,</HI> and those who may be under <HI>spiritual Doubts</HI> and <HI>Troubles;</HI> and in our <HI>public</HI> Performances. And these Duties can never be done as they ought to be, without a good Measure of Diligence and Industry. To be sure, we cannot attend the more <HI>private</HI> Duties of our Office with Fidelity, and do our Duty in the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> in a becoming Manner, unless we are active, and fill up our Time with Pains and Labour. 'Tis true, we may loiter away the Week in Indolence, or in rambling about to intermeddle in other Men's Mat∣ters, and entertain our People on the Sabbath with some <HI>hasty,</HI> or <HI>unmeditated</HI> Discourse: But such preaching has very little Worth. It may indeed pass well enough with
<PB N="16" REF="005358_0014_1018224CA9E25210"/>
the Weak and Ignorant; but 'tis perfectly tasteless to the Wise and Judicious, who, on this Account, will justly conceive a low Opinion of us. How much more would it redound to our Honour, if we so performed the Duties of our Station, as that it should be apparent to all, that our Heart was in our Business, that it swallowed up our whole Time, and employed all our Tho'ts and Powers? But I must pass on to the</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Second</HI> Branch of the Duty of Ministers, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> their <HI>taking heed to their Doctrine.</HI> And they must take heed to it, that it be <HI>Christian,</HI> in Opposition to that which is the Result of <HI>meer Reason;</HI> that it be <HI>sound,</HI> in Oppositi∣on to that which is <HI>corrupt;</HI> that it be <HI>important,</HI> in Op∣position to that which is <HI>trifling;</HI> and, in fine, that it be <HI>real,</HI> in Opposition to that which is <HI>imaginary.</HI> We shall be distinct and particular here. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Ministers should take heed to their <HI>Doctrine,</HI> that it be <HI>Christian,</HI> and not <HI>meerly rational.</HI></P>
<P>I would not, by this, be understood to find Fault with a <HI>rational</HI> Way of preaching. This was <HI>Paul'</HI>s <HI>Manner,</HI> that eminent Pattern of good preaching. Hence that Remark in his Story, Acts 17. 2. <HI>And</HI> Paul, <HI>as</HI> HIS MAN∣NER WAS, <HI>went in unto them, and three Sabbath-Days</HI> REASONED <HI>with them out of the Scriptures.</HI> And the like observable Remark we have, in the next Chapter v. 4. <HI>And he</HI> REASONED <HI>in the Synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded the Jews, and the Greeks.</HI> And 'tis a Way of preaching that ought not to be spoken against. 'Tis the Way in which Men, who are <HI>reasonable</HI> Creatures, ought to be addrest to: Nor are they treated as Men, if all pro∣per Care is not taken to inform their Judgments, and fill their Minds with the Knowledge of GOD's Will in all, spiritual Wisdom and Understanding.</P>
<P>Neither would I be understood to suggest, as if <HI>Reason</HI> had nothing to do in Matters of <HI>Revelation.</HI> So far is
<PB N="17" REF="005358_0015_10182253B66A5BE0"/>
this from the Truth, that without <HI>Reason</HI> we could never know the <HI>Meaning</HI> of a Revelation from GOD, or prove it to be one. And 'tis the peculiar Glory of the great and main Points of <HI>revealed</HI> Religion, that they are per∣fectly consistent with <HI>Reason,</HI> tho' they could not have been investigated by it: Nor does a Preacher do more Honor to <HI>Revelation,</HI> than while he discourses upon the several Articles of it in a Way of <HI>Reasoning</HI> and <HI>Argu∣ment;</HI> representing them worthy of GOD, and fit to be embraced by Men, though they should, some of them, be beyond human Comprehension. And indeed <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Reason</HI> are no such Enemies as some may be ready to imagine. There is no Doctrine of <HI>Faith,</HI> but it per∣fectly accords with the Principles of <HI>true Reason:</HI> Nor otherwise might it be received as an Article of <HI>Faith.</HI> We should never therefore oppose <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Reason;</HI> but rather consider them as Helps and Supports to each other; for so they really are: Nor can there be <HI>Faith</HI> without <HI>Reason.</HI> To be sure, it would grosly reflect upon <HI>Faith,</HI> if in Order to our being <HI>Believers,</HI> we must renounce our <HI>Reason;</HI> for this would be to put off our Character as <HI>Men.</HI></P>
<P>But though <HI>Reason</HI> may, and ought to be employed by <HI>Ministers</HI> in <HI>preaching,</HI> yet the <HI>Doctrine</HI> they preach should not be the Result of <HI>meer human Reason.</HI> It would be highly incongruous, and justly offensive, in a Minister of the Gospel, to discourse to his Hearers, as though he had no Knowledge of, or Regard to, the Re∣velation GOD has made of himself by his SON JESUS CHRIST. He should ever appear to be a <HI>Minister</HI> of CHRIST by the <HI>Doctrine</HI> he preaches. This should be truly <HI>Christian,</HI> as being fetch'd from the <HI>Gospel.</HI> His preaching should not be in <HI>Words of Man's Wisdom,</HI> but the <HI>Truth as it is in</HI> JESUS. He may properly enough, upon some Occasions, speak of those Things, which might have been known, by the due Exercise of <HI>Reason,</HI> without <HI>Revelation;</HI> but he should not confine himself, in treating even upon these Things, to <HI>meer Reason;</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="005358_0016_10182256C6B573F8"/>
but should make Use of the Light that is reflected on them from the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and take Care to consider them in the Reference they bear to CHRIST. Nor should he be ashamed to insist much in his Preaching, upon the <HI>Mysteries</HI> which were <HI>hid from Ages and Generations,</HI> but have been <HI>made manifest in these last Days,</HI> by the appear∣ing of the SON of GOD in our Nature. The Method of Salvation by the Redeemer JESUS CHRIST, the ever∣lasting Counsels of GOD unfolded to a perishing World by him, should be the <HI>main Scope</HI> of his Sermons. With PHILIP, he should <HI>preach the Things concerning the King∣dom of GOD, and the Name of</HI> JESUS CHHIST: Yea, with the Apostle PAUL, he should <HI>determine not to know any Thing</HI> among his People, <HI>save</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>and him crucified.</HI> And the more of CHRIST, not his <HI>meer Name,</HI> but the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Genius</HI> of <HI>his Religion,</HI> he discovers in his Preaching, the more worthy will he be of the Cha∣racter of an able Minister of the New-Testament.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ministers should take heed to their <HI>Doctrine,</HI> that it be <HI>sound,</HI> in Opposition to that which is <HI>false</HI> and <HI>erro∣neous.</HI> It should be the <HI>pure, uncorrupted Word</HI> of GOD. This, the <HI>Apostle</HI> had principally in the Eye; and it seems, indeed, to have been a Matter much lying on his Heart. Hence in mentioning the Qualifications proper for Mi∣nisters, that is one, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 9. <HI>Holding fast the faithful Word, as he hath been taught, that he may be able, by</HI> SOUND DOCTRINE, <HI>both to exhort, and convince the Gain∣sayers.</HI> And in his Instructions to TITUS, as a Gospel-Minister, he is particular in exhorting him <HI>to speak the Things which become</HI> SOUND DOCTRINE;—<HI>shewing Un∣corruptness, sound Speech that cannot be condemned,</HI> Chap. 2. v. 1. 7. 8. Ministers then should not be as those <HI>who corrupt the Word of GOD;</HI> they should not, as was com∣plained of the <HI>Prophets</HI> in ancient Days, <HI>prophesy Lies in GOD's Name;</HI> they should not, as was the Practice of some in the <HI>Apostle'</HI>s Days, <HI>beguile</HI> their People <HI>with en∣ticing Words,</HI> turning them away from the <HI>Simplicity of the Gospel:</HI> But that should be their Character, <HI>Teachers</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="005358_0017_1018225A9D575E28"/>
of their People <HI>in Verity; Nourishers</HI> of them <HI>in Faith and good Doctrine.</HI> They should deliver nothing but the Truth, and should do it, as much as may be, without the Mixture of any Thing <HI>erroneous:</HI> And they should be particularly cautious upon this Head, at a Time, when People <HI>will not endure sound Doctrine, but, after their own Lusts, heap to themselves Teachers, having itch∣ing Ears.</HI></P>
<P>Would the Time permit, I might here properly take Occasion to enumerate some of those <HI>Errors,</HI> which, if Ministers should countenance in their Preaching, they would not <HI>take heed to their Doctrine,</HI> that it be <HI>sound.</HI></P>
<P>The first of these <HI>Errors</HI> is, that which makes <HI>Assu∣rance</HI> essential to a Man's being a true Believer in CHRIST. The <HI>Bible</HI> knows of no such Doctrine as this. It tea∣ches, it is true, that Assurance is attainable; that it is the Duty of Christians to give Diligence to make their Calling and Election sure; and that it is a bad Sign when Men are easy and contented, while uncertain whe∣ther they are interested in the saving Mercy of GOD, through the LORD JESUS CHRIST. But it no where says, that a Man cannot be a <HI>real</HI> Christian, if under Doubts and Difficulties respecting his <HI>spiritual</HI> State: So far from it, that it expresly declares a Man may truly <HI>fear and obey GOD,</HI> and yet <HI>walk in Darkness;</HI> Yea, in Darkness to so great a Degree as to <HI>see no Light;</HI> Isai. 50. 10. It is therefore a corrupting the Truth to tell People, that <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Assurance</HI> are <HI>inseparably connected,</HI> and that there cannot be the former without the latter. And those, who deliver such Doctrine as this, justly <HI>offend the Generation of GOD's Children,</HI> who, in all Ages, have experienced the Reverse.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> also is an <HI>Error</HI> which makes the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of Conversion necessary to the Thing it self. This is a Doctrine the <HI>Scripture</HI> is an in∣tire Stranger to: Nor will it accord with the Experience
<PB N="20" REF="005358_0018_1018225D18A36F20"/>
of a great many as good Christians as any we know of in the World. Conversion, it is true, is sometimes ef∣fected in a Manner so observable, that the <HI>Time.</HI> and <HI>Circumstances,</HI> may be particularly pointed out: But 'tis not always thus, nor, it may be, most frequently. There is a vast Variety in the Dealing of GOD, with different Persons, in bringing them into a State of Grace, both as to <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Manner,</HI> as well as <HI>Degree,</HI> yea, and eve∣ry other <HI>Circumstance</HI> relative thereto. So that if some can tell <HI>when</HI> and <HI>how</HI> they were converted, it is no Ar∣gument others must be able to do the like, tho' equally in a good State. A <HI>real, thorow</HI> Conversion from Sin to GOD in CHRIST, is <HI>necessary;</HI> and to affirm it to be so is <HI>sound</HI> Doctrine: but to say that we can't be con∣verted, unless we know the <HI>precise Time</HI> when this Change was wrought, is <HI>corrupt</HI> and <HI>false.</HI></P>
<P>In like Manner, 'tis grosly <HI>erroneous</HI> to pretend, as if <HI>unregenerate</HI> Men ought not to <HI>pray;</HI> and there needs no other Proof of it than only this, that GOD has plainly commanded them to <HI>pray.</HI> Those Persons are certainly <HI>unregenerate,</HI> who want a <HI>new Heart to be given to them,</HI> and a <HI>new spirit to be put within them;</HI> and yet, that is the Language of GOD to Persons of <HI>this Character,</HI> and in Order to their Obtainment of a <HI>new Heart,</HI> and a <HI>new Spirit,</HI> Ezek. 36. 37. <HI>I will for this be enquired of by the House of Israel, to do it for them.</HI> And what if <HI>unconverted</HI> Men cannot pray in the same <HI>gracious</HI> Man∣ner with those, who have been <HI>transformed by the renew∣ing of the</HI> HOLY GHOST? Did not GOD know this before the Appointment of Prayer: And han't he, not∣withstanding, revealed it as his <HI>Mind</HI> that <HI>they</HI> should pray? Yea, that they should attend this Duty, as an <HI>Institution</HI> of his, in the Use of which they may humbly hope for <HI>converting</HI> Grace? For any therefore to insinuate, as if <HI>unconverted</HI> Men would not do well to lay open their distressed Case before the Father of Mercies, by Prayer and Supplication, with Confession, is not only, in Rea∣lity of Consequence, to arraign the <HI>Wisdom of GOD's
<PB N="21" REF="005358_0019_1018225EADEEC230"/>
Appointments,</HI> but to restrain Men from <HI>that,</HI> without which they can have no good Hope, upon the Founda∣tion of CHRIST and the <HI>Apostles,</HI> ever to expect the <HI>spe∣cial saving</HI> Grace of GOD.</P>
<P>In fine, for I must not stay to multiply Particulars 'Tis an <HI>Error,</HI> and a very <HI>dangerous</HI> one too, so to mis∣take the <HI>Use</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> of the <HI>Righteousness of</HI> CHRIST, as to suppose it takes away <HI>all Necessity</HI> of any <HI>Righte∣ousness of our own.</HI> Some, not having a clear and dis∣tinct Notion of the Gospel <HI>Use</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> of CHRIST'S <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and of <HI>our own,</HI> have spoken of these Things so as to reflect Dishonor on CHRIST, while they might intend to exalt him. The Use of <HI>our own Righteousness.</HI> in the <HI>Gospel-plan</HI> is not to entitle us to Salvation, there is no <HI>Necessity</HI> of it for this; nor is it sufficient to answer such a Purpose. When we have done our best, we are unprofitable Servanrs, as having fallen short of our Duty: And therefore it cannot be by any <HI>Works of Righteousness which we have done,</HI> that we are <HI>justified</HI> and <HI>saved;</HI> but for the Sake of CHRIST, in Con∣sideration of what he <HI>did</HI> and <HI>suffered,</HI> when he stood in the Place of Sinners. This therefore is the <HI>Use</HI> of the <HI>Righteousness of</HI> CHRIST: 'Tis our <HI>Title</HI> to Heaven, <HI>that</HI> on the Account of which we are interested in the Mer∣cy of GOD to eternal Life. But tho' it is on the Ac∣count of CHRIST'S <HI>Righteousness</HI> that we are <HI>justified</HI> and <HI>saved,</HI> and it would be highly injurious to his Merits to suppose otherwise; yet this by no Means takes away the Necessity of <HI>personal inherent Righteousness.</HI> This also has its <HI>Use,</HI> and is <HI>equally necessary</HI> in its Place. It is ne∣cessary on other Accounts, though not as our <HI>Title</HI> to Heaven. 'Tis required in the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and so becomes <HI>necessary</HI> by <HI>Divine Appointment;</HI> yea, and of such Im∣portance was this Appointment, that <HI>GOD ordain'd be∣fore the Foundation of the World,</HI> that Christians should <HI>walk in those good Works,</HI> unto which they are dispos'd and prepar'd, when they become, a second Time, <HI>his Workmanship,</HI> being <HI>created anew in</HI> CHRIST JESUS. And
<PB N="22" REF="005358_0020_101822618D238E50"/>
'tis by <HI>inherent personal Righteousness,</HI> and by this <HI>only,</HI> that Men become the <HI>capable Subjects</HI> of Salvation in Heaven. Without this, they would not be <HI>meet</HI> for the Enjoyment of it; nor could they be any more hap∣py, as reasonable Creatures, moral Agents, than <HI>Light could have Communion with Darkness,</HI> or CHRIST <HI>with Belial.</HI> But I must not enlarge—To go on,</P>
<P N="3">3. Ministers should <HI>take heed to their Doctrine,</HI> that it be <HI>important,</HI> not <HI>trifling</HI> and <HI>Useless.</HI> 'Tis observable, there were, at the Time when PAUL wrote this Epistle to TIMOTHY, certain <HI>Teachers</HI> in the Church of <HI>Ephe∣sus,</HI> who gave heed to <HI>Fables, doting about Questions, and striving about Words to no Purpose.</HI> And it was, no Doubt, in Opposition to the <HI>prophane and vain-babbling</HI> of these <HI>Teachers,</HI> that he enjoins it no TIMOTHY <HI>to take heed to his Doctrine,</HI> and elsewhere, in express Terms, <HI>not to give heed to Fables, which minister Questions, rather than godly Edifying;</HI> hereby exhibiting a just Idea of that Preaching which is not calculared to answer the great Ends of the Ministry, in building Men up in Faith and Holiness; teaching us to esteem in rather <HI>tri∣fling</HI> than <HI>preaching;</HI> as being of little more Significancy than a <HI>Fable,</HI> an idle Tale that is told. The Business of preaching is the greatest and most important that can be. It has to do with Men's <HI>spiritual</HI> Concerns, to instruct them in what they are to <HI>believe</HI> and <HI>practise,</HI> in Order to their serving GOD acceptably here, and being eternal∣ly happy in the Enjoyment of him hereafter. And shall Ministers trifle in so solemn and Affair? Shall the Peculi∣arities of a Party, the Externals of Religion, the Mo∣dalities of Worship, swallow up all their Time and Thoughts? Shall they bring every nice disputable Mat∣ter into the Pulpit, and deal perpetually in wrangling Controversies, which tend not to Holiness? It is true, they are exhorted to <HI>contend for the Faith;</HI> and they should be bold in Defence of the great and substantial Truths of Religion, those that are of considerable Impor∣tance to the Souls of Men: But for <HI>foolish Questions,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="005358_0021_10182263265D03B0"/>
and <HI>needless Disputes</HI> they should not trouble themselves, or their People with them. The Subjects of their Preaching should be the main and necessary Articles of Faith, and Rules of Life. These they should dwell up∣on; these should be the great Scope of their Discours∣es; These they should have principally in View, even when discoursing upon comparatively less important Points. And they should be abundant in Labors to ex∣plain, and establish these great and essential Principles of Religion; especially when there is Danger, lest <HI>Shipwreck should be made of Faith and a good Conscience.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Ministers should <HI>take heed to their Doctrine,</HI> that it be <HI>real,</HI> not <HI>imaginary.</HI> What they preach should have some solid Foundation; it should be Truth bottomed on the Word of GOD, and not a meer Notion, a Fancy that has Existence no where but in their own over-heat∣ed Brains.</P>
<P>Some, perhaps, may think this a needless Caution: But if they do, it is because they are ignorant of the World, yea, and of their <HI>Bibles</HI> too. There have always been <HI>visionary, enthusiastical</HI> Men; pretending to an <HI>ex∣traordinary</HI> Mission from GOD, and preaching for <HI>Doc∣trines of his,</HI> the <HI>Suggestions of their own vain Imagina∣tions.</HI> So it was in <HI>Old Testament</HI> Times. Hence that Passage directed to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation, Jer. 23. 16. <HI>Thus saith the</HI> LORD <HI>of Hosts, hearken not unto the Words of the Prophets that prophesie unto you: they make you vain; they speak a Vision of their own Heart, and not out of the Mouth of the</HI> LORD. To the same Purpose it follows in the 25. 26. 27. 32. Verses. <HI>I have heard what the Pro∣phets said, that prophesie Lies in my Name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. How long shall this be in the Hearts of the Prophets that prophesie Lies? Yea, they are Prophets of the Deceit of their own Hearts; which think to cause my People to forget my Name by their Dreams, which they tell every Man to his Neighbour.—Behold, I am against them that prophesie false Dreams, saith the</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="005358_0022_10182266047BC038"/>
LORD, <HI>and do tell them, and cause my People to err by their Lies: Yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this People at all, saith the</HI> LORD. And so it has been in all Ages of the <HI>Christian</HI> Church; yea, there have not been wanting Instances, even in our own Day, of those, who under the vain No∣tion of being <HI>extraordinarily</HI> sent of God, have gone about venting their <HI>own wild Imaginations</HI> for <HI>divine Truths,</HI> to the great Reproach of CHRIST, and Scandal of Religion. Ministers then should <HI>take heed to their Doctrine,</HI> that it be the <HI>real</HI> Truth of GOD, and not dare utter any Thing, as coming from him, but what they can prove does so. 'Tis not enough that they have an <HI>Impulse on their Spirits,</HI> that they are under <HI>supposed Im∣pressions from above.</HI> These must all be examined by the Rule of GOD's <HI>Word. To the Law and to the Testimony.</HI> If we preach not agreable hereto, there will be neither Light nor Truth in what we say, be the Pressure on our Minds ever so lively, or the Thing suggested to us of ever so much Weight in our own Imaginations. I go on to say,</P>
<P N="3">3. Ministers should not only take heed to themselves, and unto their Doctrine, but <HI>continue in them.</HI> They should hold out to the End, as to both.</P>
<P>In Respect of <HI>themselves,</HI> it is not enough that they appear to be Men of Piety for a while, but they must al∣ways do so; shewing themselves, through all the Peri∣ods of Life, <HI>Patterns of good Works, following after Righteousness, Godliness, Faith, Patience, Meekness; keep∣ing themselves without Spot, and unrebukable until the Ap∣pearing of our</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>And then as to their <HI>Doctrine,</HI> they must not only be∣gin, but go on to preach that which shall tend to the <HI>Use of Edifying.</HI> It will not suffice, if, for a Time, they deliver the Doctrine which is <HI>according to Godliness;</HI> but the same sound, pure, good Doctrine should run thro'
<PB N="25" REF="005358_0023_1018226B564D80D0"/>
the whole Course of their Preaching. Their Sermons, from first to last, should breathe the true Spirit of the Gospel, and be a Testimony for them, that they have not <HI>fallen from their Stedfastness,</HI> but continue <HI>strong in the Faith,</HI> that Faith which, by CHRIST and his <HI>Apo∣stles,</HI> was <HI>once delivered to the Saints.</HI></P>
<P>But 'tis more than Time that I pass to the next Head of Discourse, which is,</P>
<P>II. To consider the <HI>special Motive</HI> with which the <HI>Apostle</HI> inforces the <HI>Duty</HI> in the <HI>Text;</HI> Namely, <HI>For in doing this, thou shalt save both thyself, and them that hear thee.</HI> Here it may be said,</P>
<P N="1">1. Ministers by doing their Duty will <HI>save themselves.</HI> The Salvation here spoken of means Salvation in ano∣ther World, Salvation from Wrath, Salvation with eter∣nal Glory. And what a Motive is this to <HI>take heed to themselves, and to their Doctrine,</HI> to look well to their <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Conduct,</HI> both as <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Ministers?</HI> They cannot, unless they are thus careful, obtain Salva∣tion. Meerly their Character, as <HI>Officers</HI> in the Kingdom of CHRIST, will not secure them from Danger, in the <HI>great Day of GOD's Wrath. Judas,</HI> though called to be an <HI>Apostle,</HI> Yet, went to his own <HI>Place.</HI> And our <HI>Sa∣viour</HI> assures us that <HI>many,</HI> in the Day of his Appearing to judge the World in Righteousness, who <HI>prophesied in his Name,</HI> will be doom'd to a <HI>Departure from him a∣mong the Workers of Iniquity.</HI> And of all Men, wicked and unfaithful Ministers will receive the <HI>greatest Damna∣tion.</HI> It will not be enough that they are turned into Hell with the Nations that forget GOD; but by how much their Guilt has been aggravated beyond their's, by so much their <HI>Torment</HI> and <HI>Sorrow</HI> will be increased, in this Place of weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of Teeth. An awful Consideration surely! It should make us, to whom it hath pleased GOD to commit the Dis∣pensation of the Gospel, look to <HI>ourselves,</HI> and to our
<PB N="26" REF="005358_0024_1018226D22FB8548"/>
<HI>Ministry,</HI> lest, when we have preached to others, we our selves should be <HI>Cast-aways.</HI> If PAUL, that Man of GOD, who was not behind the <HI>chiefest</HI> of the <HI>Apostles;</HI> no, not in <HI>Grace,</HI> any more than <HI>Gifts,</HI> makes this Suppositi∣on in Respect of <HI>himself,</HI> much more may we, who are so far below him in all <HI>Christian,</HI> as well as <HI>ministerial</HI> Accomplishments. We should be jealous over our∣selves with a godly Jealousy, and lay ourselves out, with all Diligence and Fidelity, to do the Work we are call∣ed to, as <HI>private</HI> Men, and as intrusted with the <HI>Charge</HI> of <HI>Souls.</HI> And shall not we be quickned hereto from the Consideration, that, <HI>in doing thus, we shall save our∣selves?</HI> The Salvation of Heaven will be infinitely more than a Recompence for all our Labor and Pains, for all our Services and Trials, in fulfilling our Ministry. Nor is it all, that we shall be saved: But our Salvation shall be distinguishingly great and glorious, in Proportion to the <HI>Degree</HI> of our prudent Zeal, and active Fidelity in our LORD's Work. This supposes <HI>Degrees,</HI> of Glory in the coming World. And our <HI>Saviour</HI> himself supposes the same Thing, when he speaks of a <HI>Prophet's Reward,</HI> and distinguishes it from a <HI>righteous Man's Reward:</HI> And the Apostle PAUL supposes the same Thing, or rather directly affirms it, when he says, <HI>There is one Glo∣ry of the Sun, and another Glory of the Moon, and another Glory of the Stars: So also is the Resurrection of the Dead.</HI> And if there are <HI>Degrees</HI> of Blessedness in GOD's heavenly Kingdom, those certainly bid the fairest to be advanced to the highest of them, who spend themselves, and are spent in watching for Souls, the Souls of other Men, as well as their own: And they shall assuredly <HI>shine,</HI> in the other World, <HI>as the Brightness of the Fir∣mament, and as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI> But,</P>
<P N="2">2. Ministers, by taking heed to themselves, and to their Doctrine, will not only save themselves, but <HI>them that hear them.</HI> Not that this will always certainly be the Effect. Such a Sense of the Words is contrary to the Truth of <HI>Fact,</HI> and irreconcilable with the Com∣plaints,
<PB N="27" REF="005358_0025_1018227201165200"/>
which the wisest and most faithful Ministers, the World ever saw, have often made on Account of their Want of Success. <HI>Who hath believed our Report? To whom hath the Arm of the LORD been revealed?</HI> So spake <HI>Isaiah,</HI> that inspir'd Messenger of GOD to his People <HI>Israel</HI> And a greater than <HI>Isaiah,</HI> the SON of GOD himself, is represented in the New Testament, as be∣moaning the Unsuccessfulness of his Ministry, in these same Words of bitter Complaint, as you may see, Joh. 12. 37, 38. And so far, sometimes, are even faithful Ministers from <HI>saving</HI> the People they are sent to, that their Preaching is unhappily the Means of their being still more hardened in Sin. So it was with the very <HI>A∣postles</HI> of CHRIST. Hence that Remark of PAUL, 2. Cor. 2. 16. <HI>To the one, we are a Savour of Death unto Death.</HI> Yea, the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> was <HI>immediately</HI> com∣missioned by GOD to go, and preach to the <HI>Jewish</HI> People, when the woful Effect is declared in the Com∣mission it self. <HI>Go,</HI> (says GOD to him, Chap. 6. v. 9. 10.) <HI>tell this People, hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the Heart of this People fat, and make their Ears heavy, and shut their Eyes; lest they see with their Eyes, and hear with their Ears, and understand with their Heart, and convert and be healed.</HI> 'Tis indeed an awful Thing when People receive no saving Advantage from the Ministry of the Word; and it is still more awful, when it proves an Oc∣casion of making their hard Hearts harder, and their blind Eyes blinder; and godly faithful Ministers may be exceedingly grieved, and bowed down hereat: Tho', even in this Case, they may assure themselves they <HI>are unto GOD a sweet Savour in</HI> CHRIST <HI>in them that are saved, and in them that perish. Their Judgment is with the LORD, and their Work with their GOD: And tho' Israel is not gathered, they shall be glorious in the Eyes of the LORD, and GOD shall be their Strength.</HI> But to return,</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="005358_0026_101822749042A4B8"/>
When Ministers are urged to Heedfulness in the Dis∣charge of their, Duty, from the Consideration, that they shall <HI>save them that hear them,</HI> it must not be understood, I say, in too rigorous a Sense, as if People might not fail of the Grace of GOD, and of entring into Heaven, though they are <HI>faithful.</HI> But the Meaning rather is, that, when Ministers prudently and heedfully attend the proper Duties of their Office, they make Use of a suita∣ble and well adapted Means to promote the Salvation of Souls; yea, a Means which GOD has instituted to this End, and in the Use of which they may humbly hope for such concurring Influences of divine Grace, as shall be made effectual to the Accomplishment of it. It is by the Ordinance of preaching, that it pleases GOD to save them that believe. This is the wise Appoint∣ment of Heaven to bring about this Purpose of Divine Mercy. And who so likely to be succeeded in this De∣sign of saving Souls, as those who look to their own Hearts and Lives, and express a suitable Care, at all Times, to preach the pure uncorrupted Word of GOD? These, of all Ministers, have most Reason to expect the Blessing of GOD on their Labors: And if the Salva∣tion of Sinners does not follow upon the Word preached by them, they are not to Blame, but those that hear them.</P>
<P>And what a noble Incentive to heedful Diligence is this? Where is our Love to the People of our Charge, where our Compassion for their precious Souls, if this Motive lies not with Weight upon our Minds? The Prospect of eternally saving them who hear us, should warm our Hearts, animate our Powers, and inspire our Endeavours with Life and Vigor. If we might but be happily instrumental in promoting the everlast∣ing Felicity of a Number of the lost Sons of <HI>Adam,</HI> how highly would GOD honor us? What Occasi∣on should we have for holy Rejoicing? How should we exult in the Presence of the LORD JESUS CHRIST at his Coming? And how unspeakably blessed should we be in the Kingdom of our Father, having such Seals of our

Ministry to be unfading and eternal Crowns of Glory to us?</P>
<P>The <HI>Application</HI> remains. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. How very <HI>solemn</HI> is the Work of Ministers! We have not only our <HI>own</HI> Souls to answer for, but the Souls of <HI>our People.</HI> Our Charge, as Ministers, is like that, 1 Kin. 20. 39. <HI>Keep this Man; if by any Means he be missing, then shall thy Life be for his Life.</HI> We are <HI>set Watchmen unto the House of Israel:</HI> And if we receive the Word at GOD's Mouth, and faithfully declare it; warning the Wicked of their Way, &amp; perswading them to turn from it, by the Terrors of the Law, and the En∣couragements of the Gospel, we have delivered our Souls: If they die in their Iniquity, their Blood will not be required at our Hands. But if we are negligent to give Warning from GOD; if we flatter Men in their Sins, daubing them with untempered Mortar; if we preach to them our own <HI>Fancies,</HI> instead of the <HI>Truth</HI> of GOD; or, if the Truth we speak be so mingled with Error, so over-clouded with blind Zeal, so accompanied with unguarded Conduct, as to be an Occasion, in the natural Course of Things, of exciting Prejudices in Men's Minds against Religion, and hardening them in Sin; if they now die in their Iniquity, we may have Reason to fear, lest GOD should require their Blood at our Hands. And oh! how doleful is the Cry of Blood! the Blood of lost and undone Souls! How insupportable must be our Horror, to behold the People of our Charge, in the Place of future Torment, and to hear their bitter Ex∣ecrations; charging their Ruin upon us, our bad Doc∣trine, which corrupted their Minds; our bad Example, which encouraged them in Sin; our Remissness in our Ministry, which suffered them to go on in their evil Ways, till their Feet took hold on Death! Can we think of this, and not realise what an awful Work we are engaged in? 'Tis indeed the most solemn, Man can be intrusted with.</P>

2. How <HI>unable</HI> are Ministers, in <HI>their own Strength,</HI> to <HI>discharge</HI> the <HI>Duties</HI> of <HI>their Office!</HI> This Reflection I take from PAUL, who, when he had been discoursing on the Work of the Ministry, exclaims in that Lan∣guage, <HI>Who is sufficient for these Things!</HI> And if the great <HI>Apostle</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who, besides his strong na∣tural Genius, and acquired Learning, had the HOLY GHOST plentifully poured out upon him, not only in <HI>miraculous Gifts,</HI> but high Degrees of <HI>sanctifying Grace;</HI> I say, if the Apostle PAUL, under all these Advantages, was filled with a humbling Sense of his own <HI>Insufficien∣cy</HI> for this arduous Undertaking, with how much more Reason may the present ordinary Ministers of the Gos∣pel cry out of their own Weakness? 'Tis not an easy Thing, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> to acquit ourselves with Fidelity and Honor in the Ministry of the Gospel. Our Business is to save the Souls of them that hear us. And O what Skill is requisite so to dispense the Gospel, as that it may operate in a kind and sutable Manner, to accomplish this blessed End! What Knowledge, what Wisdom, what Heedfulness, are necessary, so to convey its Truths, as that they may, with Ease and Freedom, enter into Men's Minds; So to represent its Laws, as that they may feel their Reasonableness and Beauty, and be in Love with them; So to urge its Motives, the precious Promises and awful Threatnings revealed in it, as that they may have a joint Influence upon their <HI>Hopes</HI> and <HI>Fears,</HI> preserving a due Ballance between these grand Springs of all hu∣mane Action? To dispense the Gospel so as that it may not, through any Fault of ours, be an Occasion of Hurt but Good, is truly a very difficult Matter: And 'tis ow∣ing to Pride, Ignorance, Inconsideration, or something Worse, if any imagine otherwise.</P>
<P>When I have been most serious in my Thoughts on the Business of <HI>Preaching,</HI> viewing it as an <HI>Appointment</HI> of GOD to <HI>save Souls,</HI> I have been amazed, rather than pleased, to see Ministers venture into the Pulpit, to speak upon the great Affairs of <HI>Salvation and Damnation,</HI> with
<PB N="31" REF="005358_0029_1018227AF6074C80"/>
out any previous Fore-thought. They might, perhaps, depend upon <HI>extraordinary</HI> Communications from above: But they herein deluded themselves, and imposed upon others. None have Reason, from the <HI>Bible,</HI> to expect any Assistance from the SPIRIT, much less that which is <HI>extraordinary,</HI> while they neglect their Duty in the Use of common Means: And it is too often visible, that they receive none by the Things which they deliver.</P>
<P>Nor have I been less amazed at the <HI>Forwardness</HI> of many, who, in these Days, without any acquired Ac∣complishments, have thought themselves qualified, and in an <HI>extempore-Way</HI> too, to address to large Auditories, upon the important Concerns of everlasting Salvation. 'Tis strange any should entertain such slight Thoughts of that, which the <HI>Scripture</HI> teaches us to look upon as an <HI>Institution</HI> of JESUS CHRIST. And yet, this has been the Way of too many, in all Ages of the Church. There were those, even in the Times of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> who <HI>desired to be Teachers of the Law, understanding nei∣ther what they said, nor whereof they affirmed,</HI> 1 Tim. 1. 7. And the same Complaint may be justly made of <HI>these Times:</HI> For which Reason People need be admo∣nished, <HI>not to heap to themselves</HI> such <HI>Teachers, having itching Ears.</HI> I am sure, if Men had but just Tho'ts of the Reference which Preaching has to the <HI>Salvation of Souls,</HI> and the great <HI>Heedfulness</HI> which is necessary in Preachers, both in Respect of <HI>themselves,</HI> and their <HI>Doctrine,</HI> they would not be over-forward in this Mat∣ter; especially, if they had never taken Pains by Read∣ing, and Meditation, and Study, to acquire the needed Accomplishments for this momentous Work. The best qualified Men have been awfully sensible of their Insufficiency for it: Nor can we who are Ministers have too strong a Sense upon our Minds of the Need we stand in of Help from CHRIST; that it is he, and he only, who <HI>enables those whom he puts into the Ministry.</HI> This would make us <HI>prayerful;</HI> and give us the most
<PB N="32" REF="005358_0030_1018227F9FD56DE8"/>
hopeful Prospect of a Supply from the SPIRIT of JE∣SUS CHRIST, according to our Need.</P>
<P N="3">3. What has been said affords Matter of serious <HI>Self-Reflection</HI> to Ministers. Who of us dare say we are free from Blame? We have all our Faults and Fol∣lies, and abundant Reason herefrom for deep Hu∣miliation before GOD. Let us this Day review our <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Conduct,</HI> both as <HI>Christians</HI> and <HI>Mi∣nisters.</HI></P>
<P>Let us look into <HI>our spiritual State.</HI> Others cannot determine this, nor have they any Right or Business to meddle with it. But to <HI>us</HI> it is a Matter of the great∣est Importance to <HI>know our own selves.</HI> And in Order to this we should <HI>prove our own selves, how that</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>is in us; except we be</HI> disallowed of GOD. Let us put the Question each one to his own Soul, Have I ever felt the Power of those divine Truths which I preach to others? Has CHRIST JESUS, his Image and Likeness, <HI>been formed in me?</HI> Am I that holy, hum∣ble, meek, patient, contented, righteous, charitable Be∣liever on the SON of GOD, I call upon others to be? If, upon an impartial Examination, we have the divine SPIRIT <HI>witnessing with our own Spirits,</HI> that we are thus Christians indeed, we may have Confidence towards GOD. And O what a blessed Spring of Consolation would this be to us, under the hard Censures, and se∣vere Reproaches that are cast upon us in this Day of Trial! Now might we take to ourselves the Words of the holy Apostle PAUL, and say, <HI>It is a very small Thing that I should be judged of you, or of Man's Judg∣ment: He that judgeth me is the LORD:</HI> Yea, we might exult in that triumphing Language of his, <HI>Who shall lay any Thing to the Charge of GOD's Elect? It is GOD that justifieth, who is he that condemneth? It is</HI> CHRIST <HI>that died, yea rather that is risen again, who is even at the right Hand of GOD, who also maketh Inter∣cession for us:</HI> Nor shall any Thing be ever able
<PB N="33" REF="005358_0031_1018228230854F78"/>
to separate us from the Love of GOD in JESUS CHRIST, or to prevent our Participation of the blessed Fruits of it, in his heavenly and everlasting King∣dom.</P>
<P>But besides our <HI>private</HI> Character as <HI>Christians,</HI> we should look back and consider, what Care we have taken to fulfill our Ministry. It might be of Service to re∣flect after some such Manner as this, Was my Aim right in coming into the Ministry? Had I an honest upright Intention? Was it my main View to honor CHRIST in doing Good to Souls by promoting their Salvation? And what has been my Conduct all a∣long in the Course of my Ministry? Have I made it my sincere Endeavour to find out the true Way to Heaven, and to assist and direct my People in their Walk on in it? Have I lay'd out my main Strength in studying and preaching CHRIST JESUS <HI>and him cru∣cified?</HI> Have the great Truths of the Gospel, those wherein the Life and Power of Godliness consist, been the principal Subjects of my Ministry? Have I in all Things approved myself to the Consciences of my People, <HI>by Pureness, by Knowledge, by Long-suffering, by Kindness, by the</HI> HOLY GHOST, <HI>by Love unfeign'd, by the Armour of Righteousness, on the Right Hand, and on the Left?</HI> Have I been constant in bowing the Knee to the GOD and FATHER of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, in humble fervent Prayer for Direction and Help, a Blessing on my Studies and Labours, and that my Peo∣ple, with myself, might obtain the Salvation of Hea∣ven? We have now behav'd well in our Office; we have now done our best to serve the Interest of Souls: And if it should please GOD to crown our Endeavours with Success, O what a happy Meeting should <HI>we,</HI> and the <HI>Souls begotten to GOD under our Ministry,</HI> have, in the Day of the Appearing of the SON of MAN! Then should we, in Raptures of Joy, be able to say to the great SAVIOUR as well as Judge of Men, <HI>Here,</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="005358_0032_10182284BA7339F0"/>
LORD, <HI>are we and the Children thou hast graciously given us:</HI> And both <HI>we</HI> and <HI>they</HI> should go away into Life eternal.</P>
<P N="4">4. How reasonable is it <HI>People</HI> should take heed to themselves that they may <HI>save their own Souls!</HI> And how inexcuseable will they be, if they <HI>neglect so great Salvation! Brethren,</HI> 'tis that you might be saved, ever∣lastingly saved, that we your Ministers have had commit∣ted to us the Despensation of the Gospel. And our Hearts Desire, and Prayer to GOD for you is, that you may be saved: And GOD, I trust, is our Witness, that we would willingly spend and be spent in <HI>taking heed to our selves, and to our Doctrine,</HI> if we might but be the Means of your receiving Forgiveness of Sins, and Inheritance among them that are sanctified by Faith that is in CHRIST. But this lies not so much with <HI>us,</HI> as with <HI>your selves.</HI> Our Desires of your salvation, and most faithful Labours to promote it, won't be effectual, unless you are wrought upon to be thoughtful of your own Souls, and to look well to your selves, that you fail not of the Grace of God. O be persuaded to pay a sutable Regard to the Messages of GOD handed to you by our Ministry! Don't attend on our preaching for Fashion's Sake, and because 'tis the Custom of the Country..—Don't come to hear the Word dispensed with Preju∣dice, either against us, or the Truth of GOD delivered by us.—Don't let your Aim be to find Fault, and take Occasion to censure and reproach us: But be serious in your Attendance on our Ministrations.—Look upon them as Means instituted by GOD to bring about your Salvation: And wait upon them as such, with an awaken'd Sense, which certainly becomes you, when treated with upon the Concerns of <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Death.</HI>—Let the Salvation of your Souls be your principal View in coming up to the House of GOD. And whenever you come here, let it be with sincere Desires, and ardent Prayer, that you may receive spiritual and saving Advan∣tage; that you may gain a true Knowledge of GOD and JESUS CHRIST; a real Conformity to the Divine Image;
<PB N="35" REF="005358_0033_1018228658658F48"/>
a Heart to do your Duty, and Strength to perform it; and in a Word, that you may have the Life of Grace begun in you, and carried on, as much as may be, to Perfection.</P>
<P>And solemnly realise it, that you may finally perish under the best Ministry in the World; yea, and that you certainly will perish, if you do not make a wise and good Use of it. And if this should be your un∣happy Case, you would be without <HI>all Excuse.</HI> Said our <HI>Saviour</HI> to the <HI>Jews,</HI> John 15. 32. And it is e∣qually applicable to all Gospel-Impenitents, <HI>If I had not come, and spoken to them, they had not had Sin; but now they have no Cloak for their Sin.</HI> If you hear not CHRIST speaking to you, in the Ministry of the Word, you will have nothing to plead in your own Justifica∣tion. How then shall you escape? There is no Pos∣sibility of it: Nor will the Ruin of any Sinners be more dreadful than your's. No Sinners will be found to have abus'd greater Light and Grace; to have more highly provoked the holy GOD; to have more bit∣terly grieved the good SPIRIT of GOD; to have sin∣ned against richer Advantages, or more distinguishing Favours: And therefore none will drink deeper of the Cup of the LORD'S Indignation.—It shall be <HI>more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for you.—But, Beloved, we are per∣swaded better Things of you, and Things that accompany Salvation, though we thus speak.</HI></P>
<P>It will be but agreeable to the Occasions of the Day, and the Expectations of the Auditory, if I now turn the Discourse into an Address; <HI>First,</HI> To the <HI>Person</HI> who is to be fixed in the Ministry of the Gospel in this Place; and <HI>then,</HI> to the <HI>People</HI> who are to be his more <HI>special Charge.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis at your Desire, <HI>Sir,</HI> that I stand here to stir up your pure Mind by Way of Remembrance, that you
<PB N="36" REF="005358_0034_1018228B08374D50"/>
may be mindful of the Commandment of the <HI>Apostle</HI> of our Lord and Saviour which speaketh on that wise, <HI>Take Heed to thy self, and to thy Doctrine; continue in them.</HI> Your Care about <HI>yourself,</HI> that you might behave as is befitting a Minister of JESUS CHRIST, no one will gain say: And in the Course of your La∣bors, for a Number of Years, in another Part of GOD's Vineyard, you have not only approv'd your self a Man well furnished with Gifts for the Ministry, but a Prea∣cher of <HI>good Doctrine, sound Speech that cannot be con∣demned.</HI> We do therefore with the more Freedom recommend you to this People, and act in the Solem∣nity of setting you over them in the LORD; hoping, and praying, and expecting, that you will be to them a heedful, painful, able Minister of the New Testa∣ment.</P>
<P>Let me advise you, <HI>Sir,</HI> To look well to the Frame of your own Heart. Get, and keep, as much as may be, a strong and vigorous Sense of spiritual and eternal Concerns. This will animate you in your Work, enli∣ven your Performances, give an Energy to your Mini∣strations, and be apt to engage the Attention of your People, and strike their Minds with irresistable Con∣viction.</P>
<P>Let your Behaviour also be <HI>exemplary.</HI> This, more than any Thing, will strengthen your Influence to do Good. It will reflect a Glory on your Character, and give a strange Edge to your Discourses to your Peo∣ple, whether in public or private: Whereas, if they don't find you to be a Man of Meekness, and Humili∣ty, Seriousness and Sanctity, it will mightily take from that Veneration, which is necessary to prepare their Minds to receive what you say with Advan∣tage.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="005358_0035_1018228EA88A20C8"/>
Take heed likewise to your <HI>Doctrine;</HI> especially at this Day: For the Time is come, when many will not endure sound Doctrine, but turn away their Ears from the Truth; and this, in Matters of no small Impor∣tance. The Evidences of Conversion; the Necessity of good Works; the Nature of the SPIRIT'S Influ∣ence; the Use of the Holy Scriptures, and of the Gos∣pel-Ministry, have been egregiously misunderstood, and such false Notions touching them spread abroad, as are destructive to Religion, and the Souls of Men. Be then upon the Watch. Continue in the Things which thou hast learned, and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them. Hold fast the faithful Word; and be always ready, not only to preach the Truth, but to stand up in its De∣fence; shewing that you are able, both to exhort, and convince the Gain-sayers.</P>
<P>And let me further recommend it to you to have a <HI>special Guard</HI> upon your <HI>Pulpit,</HI> and not suffer any, so far as your Influence will reach, to enter into it, whom you have Reason to think are wanting in <HI>Gifts for E∣dification,</HI> or <HI>consent not to wholesome Words, even the Words of our</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST, <HI>and to the Doctrine which is according to Godliness:</HI> Neither would you consult the <HI>Interest of Religion</HI> among <HI>this People,</HI> on the <HI>Order of our Church-State,</HI> if you should counte∣nance that <HI>Itinerant</HI> Preaching, which has been the Oc∣casion of so much Contention in the Land. You are in <HI>Principle</HI> against this Kind of Preaching: It may therefore reasonably be expected, you will act up to your Principles, and not give Way to any, who may go about from Parish to Parish, as though they had some <HI>extraordinary</HI> Mission from above. And I the ra∣ther take Occasion to mention this, because you will, probably, have a Trial of your <HI>Stedfastness</HI> in this Respect, as <HI>he</HI> who first gave Rise to the <HI>Itinerancy,</HI> that has, of late, been so much in Practice, is again
<PB N="38" REF="005358_0036_101822907AB64DD0"/>
come among us: And if the Practice ought to be dis∣couraged in any, much more in him who is the <HI>Patron</HI> as well as <HI>Origin</HI> of it.</P>
<P>Suffer me, <HI>Sir,</HI> to <HI>beseech you,</HI> and my <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Brethren</HI> in the Ministry, here present, will not take it amiss, if I <HI>beseech</HI> them also, <HI>to mark</HI> this Man <HI>who has caused Divisions and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, and to avoid him.</HI> Turn your View, my <HI>Brethren,</HI> into all Corners of the Land: Be∣hold the Confusion in Towns; the Contention in Churches; the Alienations and Separations of People from one another, and from their Ministers: Behold the Heat of Men's Spirits; the Wildness of their I∣maginations; the Errors of their Judgment; the Dis∣orders of their Practice: Behold the unchristian Spirit of Censoriousness that has broke loose, urging Men on to the most uncharitable Conduct towards Neighbours and Friends; towards Brethren by <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Church Fellowship;</HI> and especially towards Ministers, though sound in the Faith, and visibly of a good Conversation in CHRIST: Take a View, I say, of these Things, whereby many of our Churches are so crumbling to Pieces, that there is a Call almost every Week, for the Help of Ecclesiastical Councils, in one Place, or ano∣ther; and then consider, whether it is not high Time to put on Courage, and make a Stand for the Sup∣port of Religion and good Order. And is it possible you should do this, if you strengthen the Influence of <HI>him,</HI> who is the <HI>true Source</HI> of most of this Mischief? If you invite him into your <HI>Pulpits,</HI> and teach your People to <HI>have his Person in Admiration?</HI></P>
<P>Perhaps, it will be said, these <HI>mischievous</HI> Things are only <HI>accidental Effects,</HI> and not to be charg'd upon him. So far from it, that they are the unavoidable Consequence of that <HI>Spirit</HI> in which he appear'd; and might easily have been foreseen by any one tolera∣bly
<PB N="39" REF="005358_0037_101822930326CB10"/>
acquainted with humane Nature. What might be expected, in the ordinary Course of Things, but that People should be censorious and uncharitable, speak slightily of Ministers, and judge them to be <HI>carnal</HI> and <HI>unconverted,</HI> when <HI>the Man</HI> they admired, and followed, seldom preached, but he leavened their Minds with e∣vil Surmisings of this Kind, and spake of the <HI>Genera∣lity</HI> of them, in his Writings, conveyed into all Parts of the Land, <HI>as talking of an unknown, unfelt CHRIST?</HI> What might be expected but Alienations and Separa∣tions from Ministers, as useless to the Purpose of saving Souls, when People were taught, that the <HI>Deadness in their Congregations</HI> was owing to their having <HI>dead Men to preach to them,</HI> and these <HI>dead Men</HI> were compared to the <HI>Devil</HI> in Point of Serviceableness to promote their Conversion? What might be expected, but that People should entertain an ill Opinion of our <HI>Colleges,</HI> and the <HI>Governors</HI> and <HI>Instructors</HI> of them, and have their Minds filled with Jealousies lest their Sons should be train∣ed up in Error, when they were publickly told, <HI>That their Light was become Darkness;</HI> yea, <HI>Darkness that might be felt?</HI> What might be expected but that People should run into all Manner of Wildness, Disorder and Error, when they were instructed to give heed to <HI>Im∣pulses</HI> and <HI>Impressions,</HI> and govern themselves by <HI>meer Pressures on their Minds,</HI> taking them for <HI>Communicati∣ons from the Deity?</HI> 'Tis impossible but such <HI>bad Pinciples</HI> should appear in corresponding <HI>bad Effects.</HI> And shall the Man who had the first and greatest Hand in disseminating <HI>these Principles all over the Country,</HI> be again caressed, and distinguished from all other Ministers, as though, in Compare with him, they were not worthy to preach the Gospel? Are we willing to see an Increase of our unhappy Disorders? And yet, this will, undoubtedly, be the Case, if Mini∣sters don't now appear openly, and boldly, to prevent that Misconduct, which has already prov'd so detrimen∣tal to these Churches.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="005358_0038_1018229611D9D300"/>
I fear there is a great deal of Guilt lying upon <HI>Mini∣sters,</HI> in doing no more, in the beginning of these Times, to check the Progress of those Evils, which we are now groaning under: And to speak freely, I attribute it <HI>prin∣cipally</HI> to their want of Courage to exhibit a due Testimo∣ny, in Season, against <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Disorders,</HI> and going on steadily to shew their Disapprobation of them, that they are risen to so great a Height. And if they discover the same fluctuating irresolute Temper now, suffering those, who have been the chief <HI>Sowers of Discord,</HI> to take their own Way, and do as they think fit, they may see Rea∣son to repent of their Cowardice when it is too late.</P>
<P>I know it is the Thought of some, that <HI>this Gentle∣man</HI> is now come with <HI>another spirit.</HI> But if he still as∣sumes the Character of an <HI>Itinerant,</HI> and retains his Hu∣mour of travelling about from Town to Town, all over this, and the neighbouring Provinces, where the Gospel is already preached by <HI>fixed</HI> Pastors, well qualified for their Work, 'tis not fit he should be encouraged. The <HI>Bible</HI> knows of no such <HI>Visitor</HI> of the Churches. And the obvious Language of the Man who takes upon him this Character is, That the Pastors of the Churches are not furnished for their Business, or are neg∣ligent and unfaithful in it; or that he, for his Part, is one of superior Attainments, more sanctified and better gifted; or has some <HI>extraordinary</HI> Commission setting him above all other Ministers. And the Tendency of the Thing it self is bad. It strikes directly at the <HI>Order</HI> of our <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Constitution, and threatens the intire Demolition of it. And can our Churches subsist with∣out <HI>Order?</HI> 'Tis the Strength as well as Glory of all Societies whether <HI>Christian,</HI> or <HI>Civil:</HI> Nor is it possible they should long continue in being without it. And it naturally tends to Strife, and Envy, and Schism, and an undue Preference of one Minister to another, to the great Hindrance of the Gospel. We have already seen such Effects as these. And shall not this put us upon
<PB N="41" REF="005358_0039_10180E61D19F2778"/>
our Guard? If it does not, we shall throw our selves into further Difficulties with our Eyes open.</P>
<P>I know it will be said, <HI>Good</HI> has been done by the <HI>Iti∣nerations</HI> of this <HI>Gentleman.</HI> And who is ignorant that GOD may bring <HI>Good</HI> out of <HI>Evil.</HI> The Question is, Whether this <HI>Itinerating</HI> Practice, in the Manner it has been taken up, does not tend, in the natural Course of Things, to all Kind of Disorders? And if some Good has come of it, has it not thrown the Country into a Convulsion? Has not the Effect of it been, <HI>Hatred, Variance, Emulation, Wrath, Strife, Sedition, Heresies, Bitterness, Clamour, Evil-speaking?</HI> And are not these <HI>manifestly Works of the Flesh? If ye have bitter Envying and Strife in your Hearts,</HI> the <HI>Apostle</HI> perempto∣rily declares, <HI>this is not the Wisdom that cometh from above.</HI> And <HI>where Envy and Strife is,</HI> he farther de∣clares, <HI>there is Confusion and every evil Work.</HI> And this same <HI>Apostle</HI> has set us <HI>Ministers</HI> an Example, how we should conduct in such an unhappy State of Things. When there was <HI>Envy, and Strife, and Division</HI> in the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> does he stand by as a silent Specta∣tor? No, but sets himself to do all that lay in his Power to hinder the Progress of these evil Things. And shall not we do likewise? And if we exert our selves to the utmost, can we do amiss, when we have an inspired Apostle for our Example?</P>
<P>I am aware I have exposed my self in what I have now offered to the ill Opinion of many; and 'tis pro∣bable they will reflect very severely on me: Not that I am conscious that I have given just Ground of the least Offence to any. I would willingly please all Men, in all Things: But wherein I cannot please Men, and be the Servant of CHRIST, I am at no Loss to know my Duty; and I thank GOD, I am in a Tem∣per of Mind, in the present Case, to do it. Men may call me an Opposer of that which is good, or be∣stow

on me any other odious Name: But no such Things move me, while I have the Testimony of my Conscience, that I aim at the Honor of CHRIST, and the Establishment of these Churches in Peace, and Truth, and Holiness. We ought, my <HI>Brethren,</HI> to speak our Minds, and behave like Men, in this Time of Danger; neither falling in with the Humour of the Multitude, or fearing their Resentments. Alas! what is the good Word of Man, in Compare with the Approbation of GOD, and our own Conscien∣ces? And whom should we fear, <HI>Man,</HI> the utmost Extent of whose Power reaches no further than the <HI>Body?</HI> Or <HI>GOD, who can destroy both Body and Soul in Hell?</HI> We shall, no Doubt, meet with fre∣quent Trials of our Faith and Patience, and all our other Graces, in a Day of such uncommon Trouble. The People in this Land have a more than ordina∣ry <HI>Itch</HI> to run after <HI>Strangers.</HI> So it was in <HI>former Days;</HI> And we have seen it to be so in our <HI>own Day.</HI> And this <HI>Weakness,</HI> we may expect, will be an Occasion of great <HI>Difficulty;</HI> and it may prove <HI>as great a Temptation:</HI> But if we don't, in all sutable Ways, endeavour to guard against it, the Difficulty will probably be much greater. <HI>HE that is come a∣mong us may bring us into still greater Bondage; to whom therefore we should not give Place, no, not for an Hour, that the Truth of the Gospel may continue a∣mong us.</HI> And do you think, if we put on Courage, and behave with Resolution, it will turn out to our Disadvantage? It may, possibly, for a while; but in the End we shall be no Losers. We serve a good Master. And if we are faithful, he will amply reward us, in Proportion to all the Trials we are called to pass through, for his Sake; and for the Sake of the Souls for whom he died: We shall hereafter be <HI>crowned with the far exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory.</HI></P>

I go on now to address a few Words to the <HI>People</HI> usually meeting in this House. <HI>Beloved in the LORD,</HI> we join with you in bowing the Knee to the glo∣rious <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> who has given you <HI>Oneness of Heart</HI> in the Choice of a Man to be <HI>set over the Congregation.</HI> Accept him as a Gift from the ascen∣ded, enthroned JESUS: And do whatever lies in your Power to assist and encourage him in his Ministrations among you. Free him, as much as may be, from the Cares of the World, that he may <HI>give himself wholly to these Things.</HI> Do ye not know, that they which mi∣nister about holy Things, live of the Things of the Temple? And they which wait at the Altar, are Partakers with the Altar? Even so hath the LORD <HI>ordained</HI> that they which preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel? And if he, who is your Mi∣nister, sows unto you <HI>spiritual Things,</HI> you will not esteem it a great Thing, if he should reap of your <HI>carnal Things.</HI> Who goeth a Warfare any Time at his own Charge? Who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the Fruit thereof? Or, who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the Milk of the Flock? Say I these Things as a Man? Or saith not the Law the same also? And you will, doubtless, find your Account in well supporting your <HI>Pastor.</HI> He will, by this Means, be able to make better Provision for your Souls. And what <HI>saith the</HI> LORD <HI>of Hosts? Prove me now herewith, if I will not pour you out a Blessing.</HI>—And as you have selected him from others to be your <HI>Pastor,</HI> let him have the Preference in your Affecti∣ons. Don't suffer any <HI>wandring Stranger</HI> to alienate your Hearts from him: This, in the End, will be unprofitable for you: But cherish an inward real Regard to him. Honour him in the LORD, and es∣teem him very highly for his Work's Sake.—Don't be shy to make him acquainted with your <HI>spiritual</HI> Trials and Difficulties. Don't go to <HI>others</HI> to the Neglect, or rather Contempt of him; as though he

had not Skill in such Matters, or would not lay him∣self out, in all proper Ways, to sute and serve you. This has been a Fault too common in these Times: And it has too much tended to <HI>that glorying in Men,</HI> which an inspir'd <HI>Apostle</HI> has cautioned against.—Don't be offended, if he deals plainly and faithfully with you; telling you of your Sins, and reproving you for them. He would be greatly wanting in his Duty, if he should suffer Sin upon you. He is di∣rected of GOD to <HI>reprove</HI> and <HI>rebuke,</HI> as well as ex∣hort, with all Long suffering.—Don't think it strange if you should discern in him Frailties and Imperfections. This is no more than may be expected, considering he is a <HI>Man of like Passions with yourselves.</HI> You should therefore cover his Infirmities with the Mantle of Charity, and ever be in a Disposition, not to aggra∣vate his Failings, but to make all kind Allowances, exercising Love and Candour towards him.—And let me <HI>beseech you, Brethren, for the LORD JESUS CHRIST's Sake, and for the Love of the SPIRIT, to strive in your Prayers to GOD for him.</HI> Make Mention of him without ceasing in your <HI>Families</HI> and <HI>Closets,</HI> that he may be a rich Blessing to <HI>your selves,</HI> and to <HI>your Children.</HI>—Above all, let your profit∣ing, under his Ministry, appear to all around you. Think it not enough, that the Gospel by him is preached to you. This <HI>alone</HI> won't be sufficient. It must have its <HI>proper Influence,</HI> both on your <HI>Hearts</HI> and <HI>Lives;</HI> on your <HI>Hearts,</HI> conforming them to the <HI>Image</HI> of the blessed GOD, and his Son JESUS CHRIST; and on your <HI>Lives,</HI> making them such, in all Sobriety, Righteousness, and Godliness, as the Gospel requires: In order thereto, let your Minds be open to Instruction.—Be ready to embrace the Truth in the Love of it.—Receive the Word with Meekness and Faith, and be ever willing to yield Obedience to it: So will you <HI>honour</HI> your <HI>Profession,</HI> and be the <HI>Glory</HI> of your <HI>Pastor;</HI> his
<PB N="45" REF="005358_0043_101822A40A3EE8D8"/>
<HI>Joy</HI> here, and <HI>Crown</HI> in the <HI>Day</HI> of the <HI>Manifes∣tation</HI> of the SON of GOD.</P>
<P>I cannot break off without lamenting the unhap∣py Dissension there has been in this Town, where∣by the Redeemer has been dishonored, Religion wounded, and Satan gratified. Who have been the blameable Causes, is not for me to say; nor what might have prevented it.—We heartily wish a Blessing out of the House of the LORD to the <HI>other Church</HI> and <HI>Pastor. Grace, Mercy, and Peace, be mul∣tiplied to them from the GOD and FATHER of our LORD JESUS CHRIST!</HI> And wherein any, on either Part, have said, or done any Thing amiss, the good LORD pardon them for his Mercies Sake in JESUS CHRIST!</P>
<P>And may the <HI>GOD of Love and Peace</HI> unite <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Churches</HI> in this Day of Contention! And may we all finally have Admission granted to us into that coming Kingdom of GOD, where no Offence shall be given, or taken; where there shall be no Variance or Strife, but Love and Charity in Perfection forever! Till which blessed Time, let us encourage our selves to hope for the Fulfillment of that <HI>Prayer</HI> of our SAVIOUR for the Professors of his Religion, John 17. 21. <HI>That they all may be</HI> ONE, AS THOU FATHER ART IN ME, AND I IN THEE; <HI>that they also may be</HI> ONE IN US: <HI>That the World may believe that thou hast sent me.</HI></P>
